Founded in 1917 as a school of accounting and finance in Boston's [[Back Bay, Boston|Back Bay]] neighborhood, Bentley moved to Waltham in 1968.  Bentley awards bachelor of science degrees in 14 business fields and bachelor of arts degrees in 11 arts and sciences disciplines, offering 36 minors spanning both arts and science and business disciplines. The graduate school emphasizes the impact of technology on business practice, and offers PhD programs in Business and Accountancy, the Bentley MBA with 16 areas of concentration, an integrated MS+MBA, seven Master of Science degrees, several graduate certificate programs and custom executive education programs.\n\nBentley's athletic teams compete in [[NCAA Division II|Division II]] of the [[National Collegiate Athletic Association|NCAA]] (except for men's hockey, which competes in [[NCAA Division I|Division I]]) and are known collectively as the [[Bentley Falcons]]. They compete in the [[Northeast-10 Conference]].\n\n== History ==\nBentley University was founded in 1917 as the Bentley School of Accounting and Finance by [[Harry C. Bentley]], who served as the school's president until 1953. In 1961, the college was accredited to confer four-year Bachelor of Science degrees under President Morison, who moved the college from its [[Boylston Street]] address in Boston to its current-day location in Waltham, Massachusetts. Gregory H. Adamian, a major driving force in the college's development, became the fourth president in 1970. Under his guidance, the college became accredited to confer four-year Bachelor of Arts degrees in 1971 and graduate degrees in 1973. During this time, the school also changed its name to Bentley College. In 2002, Bentley College opened up a campus in the Middle Eastern country of [[Bahrain]] in partnership with the Bahrain Institute of Banking and Finance. The college was accredited to confer its first doctoral degrees in the fields of business and accountancy in 2005.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bentley.edu/news-events/pr_view.cfm?id=2163 |title=We're sorry, but we can not find the page you're looking for. &#124; Bentley University Newsroom |publisher=Bentley.edu |date=2011-02-24 |accessdate=2011-02-28 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080207010231/http://bentley.edu/news-events/pr_view.cfm?id=2163 |archivedate=February 7, 2008 }}</ref> A main fixture of the campus, The Bentley Library, underwent a sweeping renovation in 2006 during which time the school's logo was changed to showcase the clock tower that sits atop the building.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bentley.edu/news-events/pr_view.cfm?id=2258 |title=We're sorry, but we can not find the page you're looking for. &#124; Bentley University Newsroom |publisher=Bentley.edu |date=2011-02-24 |accessdate=2011-02-28 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080207010613/http://bentley.edu/news-events/pr_view.cfm?id=2258 |archivedate=February 7, 2008 }}</ref> One year later, [[Gloria Cordes Larson]], a former state and federal government official and Boston-based lawyer, became the first female president of Bentley College.

The first buildings on the Waltham campus were built between 1965 and 1968. Today, the campus stretches across {{convert|163|acre|km2}} of land, and is accessible by the [[Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority|MBTA]] [[554 (MBTA bus)|554 bus]].\n\nBentley University's campus is divided into three parts: Upper Campus, Lower Campus, and North Campus.\n\n===Upper Campus===\n\nUpper Campus contains most of the school's academic buildings and all of its classrooms. It is located on the North side of Beaver Street. Upper campus also contains all three freshman dorms, a few upperclassman dorms, and the University's bookstore.\n\n===Lower Campus===\n\nLower Campus contains more upperclassman housing, the Dana Athletic Center, and the Multi-Purpose Arena. It is connected to upper campus via a bridge over Beaver Street.

Each building has 3 floors and includes an elevator and 2 stairwells. Originally, North Campus was intended to be graduate student housing, but due to the sharp growth of enrollment it is occupied mostly by undergraduates.\n\n==Rankings==\n\n''[[U.S. News & World Report]]<ref>{{cite magazine|title=Regional University North Rankings \u2013 Best Colleges \u2013 Education \u2013 US News and World Report |url=http://colleges.usnews.rankingsandreviews.com/best-colleges/bentley-university-2124|magazine=U.S. News and World Report|accessdate=17 December 2012}}</ref> \n* Top 10 Master's Universities in the North 2018 - Ranked 2nd\n* Top 50 Undergraduate Business Programs 2017\n\n''[[Bloomberg Businessweek]]<ref>{{cite web|title=Best Undergraduate Business Schools 2013|url=http://www.businessweek.com/articles/2013-03-20/best-undergraduate-business-schools-2013|publisher=Businessweek.com|accessdate=10 November 2014}}</ref>\n\n*Best Undergraduate Business Schools 2016 - Ranked 10th\n\n[[The Princeton Review|''Princeton Review'']]<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.princetonreview.com/college-rankings?rankings=best-career-services|title=Best Colleges for Career Services {{!}} The Princeton Review|website=www.princetonreview.com|language=en|access-date=2018-09-01}}</ref>\n\n* Best Colleges for Career Services 2019 - Ranked 1st\n* Best Colleges for Career Services 2018 - Ranked 1st\n* Best Colleges for Career Services 2017 - Ranked 2nd\n* Best Colleges for Career Services 2016 - Ranked 1st\n\n==Graduate programs==\n\n===McCallum Graduate School of Business===\nBentley's McCallum Graduate School of Business offers two master's degrees, the [[Master of Business Administration]] (MBA) and the [[Master of Science]].

Founded in 1917 as a school of accounting and finance in Boston's [[Back Bay, Boston|Back Bay]] neighborhood, Bentley moved to Waltham in 1968.  Bentley awards bachelor of science degrees in 14 business fields and bachelor of arts degrees in 11 arts and sciences disciplines, offering 36 minors spanning both arts and science and business disciplines. The graduate school emphasizes the impact of technology on business practice, and offers PhD programs in Business and Accountancy, the Bentley MBA with 16 areas of concentration, an integrated MS+MBA, seven Master of Science degrees, several graduate certificate programs and custom executive education programs.\n\nBentley's athletic teams compete in [[NCAA Division II|Division II]] of the [[National Collegiate Athletic Association|NCAA]] (except for men's hockey, which competes in [[NCAA Division I|Division I]]) and are known collectively as the [[Bentley Falcons]]. They compete in the [[Northeast-10 Conference]].\n\n== History ==\nBentley University was founded in 1917 as the Bentley School of Accounting and Finance by [[Harry C. Bentley]], who served as the school's president until 1953. In 1961, the college was accredited to confer four-year Bachelor of Science degrees under President Morison, who moved the college from its [[Boylston Street]] address in Boston to its current-day location in Waltham, Massachusetts. Gregory H. Adamian, a major driving force in the college's development, became the fourth president in 1970. Under his guidance, the college became accredited to confer four-year Bachelor of Arts degrees in 1971 and graduate degrees in 1973. During this time, the school also changed its name to Bentley College. In 2002, Bentley College opened up a campus in the Middle Eastern country of [[Bahrain]] in partnership with the Bahrain Institute of Banking and Finance. The college was accredited to confer its first doctoral degrees in the fields of business and accountancy in 2005.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bentley.edu/news-events/pr_view.cfm?id=2163 |title=We're sorry, but we can not find the page you're looking for. &#124; Bentley University Newsroom |publisher=Bentley.edu |date=2011-02-24 |accessdate=2011-02-28 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080207010231/http://bentley.edu/news-events/pr_view.cfm?id=2163 |archivedate=February 7, 2008 }}</ref> A main fixture of the campus, The Bentley Library, underwent a sweeping renovation in 2006 during which time the school's logo was changed to showcase the clock tower that sits atop the building.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bentley.edu/news-events/pr_view.cfm?id=2258 |title=We're sorry, but we can not find the page you're looking for. &#124; Bentley University Newsroom |publisher=Bentley.edu |date=2011-02-24 |accessdate=2011-02-28 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080207010613/http://bentley.edu/news-events/pr_view.cfm?id=2258 |archivedate=February 7, 2008 }}</ref> One year later, [[Gloria Cordes Larson]], a former state and federal government official and Boston-based lawyer, became the first female president of Bentley College.

The first buildings on the Waltham campus were built between 1965 and 1968. Today, the campus stretches across {{convert|163|acre|km2}} of land, and is accessible by the [[Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority|MBTA]] [[554 (MBTA bus)|554 bus]].\n\nBentley University's campus is divided into three parts: Upper Campus, Lower Campus, and North Campus.\n\n===Upper Campus===\n\nUpper Campus contains most of the school's academic buildings and all of its classrooms. It is located on the North side of Beaver Street. Upper campus also contains all three freshman dorms, a few upperclassman dorms, and the University's bookstore.\n\n===Lower Campus===\n\nLower Campus contains more upperclassman housing, the Dana Athletic Center, and the Multi-Purpose Arena. It is connected to upper campus via a bridge over Beaver Street.

Transportation to and from North Campus is provided via shuttle bus. North Campus contains only residence hall buildings named: A, B, C and D. Residence halls A and B were opened in 2005 while C and D were opened in 2007, making North Campus the most recent addition to Bentley's housing facilities. Each building has 3 floors and includes an elevator and 2 stairwells. Originally, North Campus was intended to be graduate student housing, but due to the sharp growth of enrollment it is occupied mostly by undergraduates.\n\n==Rankings==\n\n''[[U.S. News & World Report]]<ref>{{cite magazine|title=Regional University North Rankings \u2013 Best Colleges \u2013 Education \u2013 US News and World Report |url=http://colleges.usnews.rankingsandreviews.com/best-colleges/bentley-university-2124|magazine=U.S. News and World Report|accessdate=17 December 2012}}</ref> \n* Top 10 Master's Universities in the North 2018 - Ranked 2nd\n* Top 50 Undergraduate Business Programs 2017\n\n''[[Bloomberg Businessweek]]<ref>{{cite web|title=Best Undergraduate Business Schools 2013|url=http://www.businessweek.com/articles/2013-03-20/best-undergraduate-business-schools-2013|publisher=Businessweek.com|accessdate=10 November 2014}}</ref>\n\n*Best Undergraduate Business Schools 2016 - Ranked 10th\n\n[[The Princeton Review|''Princeton Review'']]<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.princetonreview.com/college-rankings?rankings=best-career-services|title=Best Colleges for Career Services {{!}} The Princeton Review|website=www.princetonreview.com|language=en|access-date=2018-09-01}}</ref>\n\n* Best Colleges for Career Services 2019 - Ranked 1st\n* Best Colleges for Career Services 2018 - Ranked 1st\n* Best Colleges for Career Services 2017 - Ranked 2nd\n* Best Colleges for Career Services 2016 - Ranked 1st\n\n==Graduate programs==\n\n===McCallum Graduate School of Business===\nBentley's McCallum Graduate School of Business offers two master's degrees, the [[Master of Business Administration]] (MBA) and the [[Master of Science]].

Between 100 BC and 100 AD. Found in [[Esmeraldas, Ecuador|Esmeraldas]]]]\nVarious peoples had settled in the area of future Ecuador before the arrival of the [[Incas]]. The archeological evidence suggests that the [[Paleo-Indians]]' first dispersal into the Americas occurred near the end of the [[last glacial period]], around 16,500\u201313,000 years ago. The first Indians who reached Ecuador may have journeyed by land from North and Central America or by boat down the [[Pacific Ocean]] coastline. Much later migrations to Ecuador may have come via the Amazon tributaries, others descended from northern [[South America]], and others ascended from the southern part of South America through the Andes. They developed different languages while emerging as unique ethnic groups.\n\nEven though their languages were unrelated, these groups developed similar groups of cultures, each based in different environments. The people of the coast developed a fishing, hunting, and gathering culture; the people of the highland Andes developed a sedentary agricultural way of life, and the people of the Amazon basin developed a nomadic hunting-and-gathering mode of existence.\n\nOver time these groups began to interact and intermingle with each other so that groups of families in one area became one community or tribe, with a similar language and culture. Many civilizations arose in Ecuador, such as the [[Valdivia Culture]] and [[Machalilla Culture]] on the coast, the [[Quitus]] (near present-day Quito), and the [[Ca\u00f1ari]] (near present-day [[Cuenca, Ecuador|Cuenca]]). Each civilization developed its own distinctive architecture, pottery, and religious interests.\n\nIn the highland Andes mountains, where life was more sedentary, groups of tribes cooperated and formed villages; thus the first nations based on agricultural resources and the domestication of animals formed. Eventually, through wars and marriage alliances of their [[leader]]s, a group of nations formed confederations. One region consolidated under a confederation called the [[Shyris]], which exercised organized trading and bartering between the different regions. Its political and military power came under the rule of the Duchicela blood-line.\n\n===Inca era===\n[[File:Ecuador ingapirca inca ruins.jpg|thumb|Ruins of [[Ingapirca]], this site served as an outpost and provisioning of the Incan troops, but mainly it was a place of worship and veneration to the sun, the supreme Inca God, thus constituting a [[Coricancha]], dedicated to the Inca ritual.]]\n[[File:M\u00famia de cabe\u00e7a - Povo Jivaro 01.jpg|thumb|upright|Pre-Hispanic shrunken head of the [[Shuar]]s ([[Jivaroan peoples]]).]]\nWhen the [[Incas]] arrived, they found that these confederations were so developed that it took the Incas two generations of rulers\u2014[[Topa Inca Yupanqui]] and [[Huayna Capac]]\u2014to absorb them into the [[Inca Empire]]. The native confederations that gave them the most problems were deported to distant areas of Peru, Bolivia, and north Argentina. Similarly, a number of loyal Inca subjects from Peru and Bolivia were brought to Ecuador to prevent rebellion. Thus, the region of highland Ecuador became part of the [[Inca Empire]] in 1463 sharing the same language.\n\nIn contrast, when the Incas made incursions into coastal Ecuador and the eastern Amazon jungles of Ecuador, they found both the environment and indigenous people more hostile. Moreover, when the Incas tried to subdue them, these indigenous people withdrew to the interior and resorted to [[guerrilla]] tactics. As a result, Inca expansion into the Amazon Basin and the Pacific coast of Ecuador was hampered. The indigenous people of the Amazon jungle and coastal Ecuador remained relatively autonomous until the Spanish soldiers and missionaries arrived in force. The Amazonian people and the [[Chachi people|Cayapas]] of Coastal Ecuador were the only groups to resist Inca and Spanish domination, maintaining their language and culture well into the 21st century.\n\nBefore the arrival of the Spaniards, the Inca Empire was involved in a [[Inca Civil War|civil war]]. The untimely death of both the heir Ninan Cuchi and the Emperor Huayna Capac, from a European disease that spread into Ecuador, created a power vacuum between two factions. The northern faction headed by Atahualpa claimed that Huayna Capac gave a verbal decree before his death about how the empire should be divided. He gave the territories pertaining to present-day Ecuador and northern Peru to his favorite son Atahualpa, who was to rule from Quito; and he gave the rest to [[Hu\u00e1scar]], who was to rule from [[Cuzco]]. He willed that his heart be buried in Quito, his favorite city, and the rest of his body be buried with his ancestors in Cuzco.\n\nHu\u00e1scar did not recognize his father's will, since it did not follow Inca traditions of naming an Inca through the priests. Hu\u00e1scar ordered Atahualpa to attend their father's burial in Cuzco and pay homage to him as the new Inca ruler. Atahualpa, with a large number of his father's veteran soldiers, decided to ignore Hu\u00e1scar, and a civil war ensued. A number of bloody battles took place until finally Hu\u00e1scar was captured. Atahualpa marched south to Cuzco and massacred the royal family associated with his brother.\n\nIn 1532, a small band of Spaniards headed by Francisco Pizarro landed in Tumbez and marched over the Andes Mountains until they reached Cajamarca, where the new Inca Atahualpa was to hold an interview with them. Valverde, the priest, tried to convince Atahualpa that he should join the Catholic Church and declare himself a vassal of Spain. This infuriated Atahualpa so much that he threw the Bible to the ground. At this point the enraged Spaniards, with orders from Valverde, attacked and massacred unarmed escorts of the Inca and captured Atahualpa. [[Pizarro]] promised to release Atahualpa if he made good his promise of filling a room full of gold. But, after a mock trial, the Spaniards executed Atahualpa by strangulation.\n\n===Spanish rule===\n[[File:Plaza principal de Quito, an\u00f3nimo - siglo XVIII (Museo de la Moneda, Bogot\u00e1).jpg|thumb|Major square of Quito.

At the same time, the natives were forced into the ''[[encomienda]]'' labor system for the Spanish. In 1563, [[Quito]] became the seat of a [[Royal Audience of Quito|real audiencia]] (administrative district) of Spain and part of the [[Viceroyalty of Peru]] and later the [[Viceroyalty of New Granada]].\n\nThe [[1797 Riobamba earthquake]], which caused up to 40,000 casualties, was studied by [[Alexander von Humboldt]], when he visited the area in 1801\u20131802.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Lavilla|first=E.O.|year=2004|title=Under the Southern Cross: Stories around Humboldt and Bonpland's trip to the New Continent|journal=Latin American Applied Research|volume=34|pages=203\u2013208|url=http://www.scielo.org.ar/pdf/laar/v34n4/v34n4a01.pdf|accessdate=22 August 2010}}</ref>\n\nAfter nearly 300 years of Spanish rule, Quito was still a small city numbering 10,000 inhabitants. On August 10, 1809, the city's ''[[Criollo people|criollos]]'' called for independence from Spain (first among the peoples of Latin America). They were led by Juan P\u00edo Mont\u00fafar, Quiroga, Salinas, and Bishop Cuero y Caicedo. Quito's nickname, \"''[[Luz de Am\u00e9rica]]''\" (\"Light of America\"), is based on its leading role in trying to secure an independent, local government. Although the new government lasted no more than two months, it had important repercussions and was an inspiration for the independence movement of the rest of Spanish America. August 10 is now celebrated as Independence Day, a [[Public holidays in Ecuador|national holiday]].<ref>{{Cite news |url=https://www.eltelegrafo.com.ec/noticias/editoriales/19/ecuador-en-el-dia-de-la-independencia-nacional |title=Ecuador en el d\u00eda de la Independencia nacional |date=2017-08-10 |work=El Tel\u00e9grafo |access-date=2018-08-08 |language=es-es |df=mdy-all |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180808202916/https://www.eltelegrafo.com.ec/noticias/editoriales/19/ecuador-en-el-dia-de-la-independencia-nacional |archive-date=August 8, 2018 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\n===Independence===\n{{Main|Ecuadorian War of Independence}}\n[[File:Jose Antonio de Sucre.JPG|thumb|upright|Venezuelan independence leader [[Antonio Jos\u00e9 de Sucre]]]]\n[[File:Entrevista de Guayaquil.jpg|thumb|upright|The \"[[Guayaquil Conference]]\" was the meeting between the two main Hispanic South American independence leaders.

Its inhabitants celebrated what is now Ecuador's official Independence Day on May 24, 1822. The rest of Ecuador gained its independence after [[Antonio Jos\u00e9 de Sucre]] defeated the Spanish Royalist forces at the [[Battle of Pichincha]], near [[Quito]]. Following the battle, Ecuador joined [[Sim\u00f3n Bol\u00edvar]]'s [[Republic of Gran Colombia]], also including modern-day [[Colombia]], [[Venezuela]] and [[Panama]]. In 1830, Ecuador separated from Gran Colombia and became an independent republic.\n\nThe 19th century was marked by instability for Ecuador with a rapid succession of rulers. The first president of Ecuador was the Venezuelan-born [[Juan Jos\u00e9 Flores]], who was ultimately deposed, followed by several authoritarian leaders, such as [[Vicente Rocafuerte]]; [[Jos\u00e9 Joaqu\u00edn de Olmedo]]; [[Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Urbina]]; [[Diego Noboa]]; [[Pedro Jos\u00e9 de Arteta]]; [[Manuel de Asc\u00e1subi]]; and Flores's own son, [[Antonio Flores Jij\u00f3n]], among others. The conservative [[Gabriel Garcia Moreno]] unified the country in the 1860s with the support of the Roman Catholic Church. In the late 19th century, world demand for [[Cocoa bean|cocoa]] tied the economy to commodity exports and led to migrations from the highlands to the agricultural frontier on the coast.\n\nEcuador [[Abolition of slavery timeline|abolished]] [[Slavery in Latin America|slavery]] and freed its black slaves in 1851.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cidcm.umd.edu/mar/assessment.asp?groupId=13001 |title=Assessment for Blacks in Ecuador |publisher=CIDCM |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120622220302/http://www.cidcm.umd.edu/mar/assessment.asp?groupId=13001 |archivedate=June 22, 2012 |df=mdy }}</ref>\n\n===Liberal Revolution===\n[[File:Historic Center of Quito - World Heritage Site by UNESCO - Photo 437.jpg|thumb|Antique [[Dugout (boat)|dug out canoes]] in the courtyard of the Old Military Hospital in the [[Historic Center of Quito]]]]\n{{Main|Liberal Revolution of 1895}}\nThe Liberal Revolution of 1895 under [[Eloy Alfaro]] reduced the power of the clergy and the conservative land owners.

He supported his claims with Spanish Royal decrees or ''Real Cedulas'', that delineated the borders of Spain's former overseas colonies. In the case of Ecuador, Flores-based Ecuador's ''[[de jure]]'' claims on the following cedulas - Real Cedula of 1563, 1739, and 1740; with modifications in the Amazon Basin and Andes Mountains that were introduced through the Treaty of Guayaquil (1829) which Peru reluctantly signed, after the overwhelmingly outnumbered Gran Colombian force led by [[Antonio Jos\u00e9 de Sucre]] defeated President and General La Mar's Peruvian invasion force in the [[Battle of Tarqui]]. In addition, Ecuador's eastern border with the Portuguese colony of [[Brazil]] in the Amazon Basin was modified before the wars of Independence by the [[First Treaty of San Ildefonso]] (1777) between the [[Spanish Empire]] and the [[Portuguese Empire]]. Moreover, to add legitimacy to his claims, on February 16, 1840, Flores signed a treaty with Spain, whereby Flores convinced Spain to officially recognize Ecuadorian independence and its sole rights to colonial titles over Spain's former colonial territory known anciently to Spain as the Kingdom and Presidency of Quito.\n\nEcuador during its long and turbulent history has lost most of its contested territories to each of its more powerful neighbors, such as Colombia in 1832 and 1916, Brazil in 1904 through a series of peaceful treaties, and Peru after a short war in which the Protocol of Rio de Janeiro was signed in 1942.\n\n====Struggle for independence====\nDuring the [[Spanish American wars of independence|struggle for independence]], before Peru or Ecuador became independent nations, a few areas of the former Vice Royalty of New Granada - Guayaquil, Tumbez, and Ja\u00e9n - declared themselves independent from Spain. A few months later, a part of the Peruvian liberation army of San Martin decided to occupy the independent cities of Tumbez and Ja\u00e9n with the intention of using these towns as springboards to occupy the independent city of Guayaquil and then to liberate the rest of the Audiencia de Quito (Ecuador). It was common knowledge among the top officers of the liberation army from the south that their leader [[Jos\u00e9 de San Mart\u00edn|San Martin]] wished to liberate present-day Ecuador and add it to the future republic of Peru, since it had been part of the Inca Empire before the Spaniards conquered it.\n\nHowever, [[Sim\u00f3n Bol\u00edvar|Bol\u00edvar]]'s intention was to form a new republic known as the Gran Colombia, out of the liberated Spanish territory of New Granada which consisted of Colombia, Venezuela, and Ecuador. San Martin's plans were thwarted when [[Sim\u00f3n Bol\u00edvar|Bol\u00edvar]], with the help of Marshal Antonio Jos\u00e9 de Sucre and the Gran Colombian liberation force, descended from the Andes mountains and occupied Guayaquil; they also annexed the newly liberated Audiencia de Quito to the Republic of [[Gran Colombia]]. This happened a few days before San Martin's Peruvian forces could arrive and occupy Guayaquil, with the intention of annexing Guayaquil to the rest of Audiencia of Quito (Ecuador) and to the future republic of Peru. Historic documents repeatedly stated that San Martin told Bolivar he came to Guayaquil to liberate the land of the Incas from Spain. Bolivar countered by sending a message from Guayaquil welcoming San Martin and his troops to Colombian soil.\n\n====Peruvian occupation of Ja\u00e9n, Tumbes, and Guayaquil====\nIn the south, Ecuador had ''de jure'' claims to a small piece of land beside the Pacific Ocean known as [[Tumbes Region|Tumbes]] which lay between the [[Zarumilla River|Zarumilla]] and [[Tumbes River|Tumbes]] rivers. In Ecuador's southern Andes Mountain region where the Mara\u00f1on cuts across, Ecuador had ''de jure'' claims to an area it called [[Ja\u00e9n, Peru|Ja\u00e9n de Bracamoros]]. These areas were included as part of the territory of Gran Colombia by Bolivar on December 17, 1819, during the [[Congress of Angostura]] when the Republic of Gran Colombia was created. Tumbes declared itself independent from Spain on January 17, 1821, and Jaen de Bracamoros on June 17, 1821, without any outside help from revolutionary armies. However, that same year, 1821, Peruvian forces participating in the Trujillo revolution occupied both Jaen and Tumbes. Some Peruvian generals, without any legal titles backing them up and with Ecuador still federated with the Gran Colombia, had the desire to annex Ecuador to the Republic of Peru at the expense of the Gran Colombia, feeling that Ecuador was once part of the Inca Empire.\n\nOn July 28, 1821, Peruvian independence was proclaimed in Lima by the Liberator San Martin, and Tumbes and Jaen, which were included as part of the revolution of Trujillo by the Peruvian occupying force, had the whole region swear allegiance to the new Peruvian flag and incorporated itself into Peru, even though Peru was not completely liberated from Spain. After Peru was completely liberated from Spain by the patriot armies led by Bolivar and Antonio Jose de Sucre at the [[Battle of Ayacucho]] dated December 9, 1824, there was a strong desire by some Peruvians to resurrect the [[Inca Empire]] and to include Bolivia and Ecuador. One of these Peruvian Generals was the Ecuadorian-born [[Jos\u00e9 de La Mar]], who became one of Peru's presidents after Bolivar resigned as dictator of Peru and returned to Colombia. Gran Colombia had always protested Peru for the return of Jaen and Tumbes for almost a decade, then finally Bolivar after long and futile discussion over the return of Jaen, Tumbes, and part of Mainas, declared war. President and General [[Jos\u00e9 de La Mar]], who was born in Ecuador, believing his opportunity had come to annex the District of Ecuador to Peru, personally, with a Peruvian force, invaded and occupied Guayaquil and a few cities in the Loja region of southern Ecuador on November 28, 1828.\n\nThe war ended when a triumphant heavily outnumbered southern Gran Colombian army at [[Battle of Tarqui]] dated February 27, 1829, led by [[Antonio Jos\u00e9 de Sucre]], defeated the Peruvian invasion force led by President La Mar. This defeat led to the signing of the Treaty of Guayaquil dated September 22, 1829, whereby Peru and its Congress recognized Gran Colombian rights over Tumbes, Jaen, and Maynas. Through protocolized meetings between representatives of Peru and Gran Colombia, the border was set as Tumbes river in the west and in the east the Maranon and Amazon rivers were to be followed toward Brazil as the most natural borders between them. However, what was pending was whether the new border around the Jaen region should follow the Chinchipe River or the Huancabamba River. According to the peace negotiations Peru agreed to return Guayaquil, Tumbez, and Ja\u00e9n; despite this, Peru returned Guayaquil, but failed to return Tumbes and Ja\u00e9n, alleging that it was not obligated to follow the agreements, since the Gran Colombia ceased to exist when it divided itself into three different nations - Ecuador, Colombia, and Venezuela.\n\n====The dissolution of Gran Colombia====\n[[File:AGHRC (1890) - Carta XI - Divisi\u00f3n pol\u00edtica de Colombia, 1824.jpg|thumb|Map of the former [[Gran Colombia]] in 1824 (named in its time as Colombia), the Gran Colombia covered all the colored region.]]\n[[File:Ecuador1832.png|thumb|Ecuador in 1832]]\n\nThe Central District of the Gran Colombia, known as Cundinamarca or New Granada (modern Colombia) with its capital in Bogota, did not recognize the separation of the Southern District of the Gran Colombia, with its capital in Quito, from the Gran Colombian federation on May 13, 1830. After Ecuador's separation, the [[Department of Cauca]] voluntarily decided to unite itself with Ecuador due to instability in the central government of Bogota. The Venezuelan born President of Ecuador, the general [[Juan Jos\u00e9 Flores]], with the approval of the Ecuadorian congress annexed the Department of Cauca on December 20, 1830, since the government of Cauca had called for union with the District of the South as far back as April 1830. Moreover, the Cauca region, throughout its long history, had very strong economic and cultural ties with the people of Ecuador. Also, the Cauca region, which included such cities as [[Pasto, Colombia|Pasto]], [[Popay\u00e1n]], and [[Buenaventura, Valle del Cauca|Buenaventura]], had always been dependent on the Presidencia or Audiencia of Quito.\n\nFruitless negotiations continued between the governments of Bogot\u00e1 and Quito, where the government of Bogot\u00e1 did not recognize the separation of Ecuador or that of Cauca from the Gran Colombia until war broke out in May 1832. In five months, New Granada defeated Ecuador due to the fact that the majority of the Ecuadorian Armed Forces were composed of rebellious angry unpaid veterans from Venezuela and Colombia that did not want to fight against their fellow countrymen. Seeing that his officers were rebelling, mutinying, and changing sides, President Flores had no option but to reluctantly make peace with New Granada. The Treaty of Pasto of 1832 was signed by which the Department of Cauca was turned over to New Granada (modern Colombia), the government of Bogot\u00e1 recognized Ecuador as an independent country and the border was to follow the Ley de Divisi\u00f3n Territorial de la Rep\u00fablica de Colombia (Law of the Division of Territory of the Gran Colombia) passed on June 25, 1824. This law set the border at the river Carchi and the eastern border that stretched to Brazil at the Caquet\u00e1 river. Later, Ecuador contended that the Republic of Colombia, while reorganizing its government, unlawfully made its eastern border provisional and that Colombia extended its claims south to the Napo River because it said that the Government of Popay\u00e1n extended its control all the way to the Napo River.\n\n====Struggle for possession of the Amazon Basin====\n[[File:South America 1879.png|thumb|left|South America (1879): All land claims by Peru, Ecuador, Colombia, Brazil, Argentina, Chile, and Bolivia in 1879]]\nWhen Ecuador seceded from the Gran Colombia, Peru decided not to follow the treaty of Guayaquil of 1829 or the protocoled agreements made. Peru contested Ecuador's claims with the newly discovered ''Real Cedula'' of 1802, by which Peru claims the King of Spain had transferred these lands from the Viceroyalty of New Granada to the Viceroyalty of Peru. During colonial times this was to halt the ever-expanding Portuguese settlements into Spanish domains, which were left vacant and in disorder after the expulsion of Jesuit missionaries from their bases along the Amazon Basin. Ecuador countered by labeling the Cedula of 1802 an ecclesiastical instrument, which had nothing to do with political borders. Peru began its de facto occupation of disputed Amazonian territories, after it signed a secret 1851 peace treaty in favor of Brazil. This treaty disregarded Spanish rights that were confirmed during colonial times by a Spanish-Portuguese treaty over the Amazon regarding territories held by illegal Portuguese settlers.\n\nPeru began occupying the defenseless missionary villages in the Mainas or Maynas region, which it began calling Loreto, with its capital in [[Iquitos]]. During its negotiations with Brazil, Peru stated that based on the royal cedula of 1802, it claimed Amazonian Basin territories up to Caqueta River in the north and toward the Andes Mountain range, depriving Ecuador and Colombia of all their claims to the Amazon Basin. Colombia protested stating that its claims extended south toward the Napo and Amazon Rivers. Ecuador protested that it claimed the Amazon Basin between the Caqueta river and the Mara\u00f1on-Amazon river. Peru ignored these protests and created the Department of Loreto in 1853 with its capital in Iquitos which it had recently invaded and systematically began to occupy using the river systems in all the territories claimed by both Colombia and Ecuador. Peru briefly occupied Guayaquil again in 1860, since Peru thought that Ecuador was selling some of the disputed land for development to British bond holders, but returned Guayaquil after a few months. The border dispute was then submitted to Spain for arbitration from 1880 to 1910, but to no avail.\n\nIn the early part of the 20th century, Ecuador made an effort to peacefully define its eastern Amazonian borders with its neighbours through negotiation. On May 6, 1904, Ecuador signed the Tobar-Rio Branco Treaty recognizing Brazil's claims to the Amazon in recognition of Ecuador's claim to be an Amazonian country to counter Peru's earlier Treaty with Brazil back in October 23, 1851. Then after a few meetings with the Colombian government's representatives an agreement was reached and the Mu\u00f1oz Vernaza-Suarez Treaty was signed July 15, 1916, in which Colombian rights to the Putumayo river were recognized as well as Ecuador's rights to the Napo river and the new border was a line that ran midpoint between those two rivers. In this way, Ecuador gave up the claims it had to the Amazonian territories between the Caquet\u00e1 River and Napo River to Colombia, thus cutting itself off from Brazil. Later, a brief war erupted between Colombia and Peru, over Peru's claims to the Caquet\u00e1 region, which ended with Peru reluctantly signing the Salomon-Lozano Treaty on March 24, 1922. Ecuador protested this secret treaty, since Colombia gave away Ecuadorian claimed land to Peru that Ecuador had given to Colombia in 1916.\n\nIn July 21, 1924, the Ponce-Castro Oyanguren Protocol was signed between Ecuador and Peru where both agreed to hold direct negotiations and to resolve the dispute in an equitable manner and to submit the differing points of the dispute to the United States for arbitration. Negotiations between the Ecuadorian and Peruvian representatives began in Washington on September 30, 1935. These negotiations were long and tiresome. Both sides logically presented their cases, but no one seemed to give up their claims. Then on February 6, 1937, Ecuador presented a transactional line which Peru rejected the next day. The negotiations turned into intense arguments during the next 7 months and finally on September 29, 1937, the Peruvian representatives decided to break off the negotiations without submitting the dispute to arbitration because the direct negotiations were going nowhere.\n\nFour years later in 1941, amid fast-growing tensions within disputed territories around the Zarumilla River, war broke out with Peru. Peru claimed that Ecuador's military presence in Peruvian-claimed territory was an invasion; Ecuador, for its part, claimed that Peru had recently invaded Ecuador around the Zarumilla River and that Peru since Ecuador's independence from Spain has systematically occupied Tumbez, Jaen, and most of the disputed territories in the Amazonian Basin between the Putomayo and Mara\u00f1on Rivers. In July 1941, troops were mobilized in both countries. Peru had an army of 11,681 troops who faced a poorly supplied and inadequately armed Ecuadorian force of 2,300, of which only 1,300 were deployed in the southern provinces. Hostilities erupted on July 5, 1941, when Peruvian forces crossed the Zarumilla river at several locations, testing the strength and resolve of the Ecuadorian border troops. Finally, on July 23, 1941, the Peruvians launched a major invasion, crossing the Zarumilla river in force and advancing into the Ecuadorian province of [[El Oro Province|El Oro]].\n\n[[File:Ecuador-peru-land-claims-01.png|thumb|left|Map of Ecuadorian land claims after 1916]]\n\nDuring the course of the [[Ecuadorian\u2013Peruvian War]], Peru gained control over part of the disputed territory and some parts of the province of El Oro, and some parts of the [[Loja Province|province of Loja]], demanding that the Ecuadorian government give up its territorial claims. The Peruvian Navy blocked the port of [[Guayaquil]], almost cutting all supplies to the Ecuadorian troops. After a few weeks of war and under pressure by the United States and several Latin American nations, all fighting came to a stop. Ecuador and Peru came to an accord formalized in the [[Rio Protocol]], signed on January 29, 1942, in favor of hemispheric unity against the [[Axis Powers]] in [[World War II]] favouring Peru with the territory they occupied at the time the war came to an end.\n\nThe 1944 [[Glorious May Revolution]] followed a military-civilian rebellion and a subsequent civic strike which successfully removed Carlos Arroyo del R\u00edo as a dictator from Ecuador's government. However, a post-Second World War recession and popular unrest led to a return to populist politics and domestic military interventions in the 1960s, while foreign companies developed oil resources in the Ecuadorian Amazon. In 1972, construction of the Andean pipeline was completed. The pipeline brought oil from the east side of the Andes to the coast, making Ecuador South America's second largest oil exporter. The pipeline in southern Ecuador did nothing to resolve tensions between Ecuador and Peru, however.\n\n[[File:Relevo-ecu.JPG|thumb|Ecuadorian troops during the [[Cenepa War]]]]\n[[File:Mirage F.1JA.JPG|thumb|The [[Dassault Mirage F1|Mirage F.1JA]] (FAE-806) was one aircraft involved in the claimed shooting down of two Peruvian [[Sukhoi Su-22]] on February 10, 1995.]]\nThe [[Rio Protocol]] failed to precisely resolve the border along a little river in the remote ''Cordillera del C\u00f3ndor'' region in southern Ecuador. This caused a long-simmering dispute between Ecuador and Peru, which ultimately led to fighting between the two countries; first a border skirmish in January\u2013February 1981 known as the [[Paquisha Incident]], and ultimately full-scale warfare in January 1995 where the Ecuadorian military shot down Peruvian aircraft and helicopters and Peruvian infantry marched into southern Ecuador. Each country blamed the other for the onset of hostilities, known as the [[Cenepa War]]. [[Sixto Dur\u00e1n Ball\u00e9n]], the Ecuadorian president, famously declared that he would not give up a single centimeter of Ecuador. Popular sentiment in Ecuador became strongly [[nationalism|nationalistic]] against Peru: graffiti could be seen on the walls of Quito referring to Peru as the \"''Cain de Latinoam\u00e9rica''\", a reference to the murder of [[Abel]] by his brother [[Cain]] in the [[Book of Genesis]].<ref>Roos, Wilma and van Renterghem, Omer ''Ecuador'', New York, 2000, p.5.</ref>\n\nEcuador and Peru signed the [[Brasilia Presidential Act]] peace agreement on October 26, 1998, which ended hostilities, and effectively put an end to the Western Hemisphere's longest running territorial dispute.<ref name=\"ucdp.uu.se\">{{cite web|title=Uppsala Conflict Data Program - Conflict Encyclopedia, General Conflict Information, Conflict name: Ecuador - Peru, In depth, Background to the 1995 fighting and Ecuador and Peru engage in armed conflict|accessdate=July 15, 2013|url=http://www.ucdp.uu.se/gpdatabase/gpcountry.php?id=126&regionSelect=5-Southern_Americas#|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130927150723/http://www.ucdp.uu.se/gpdatabase/gpcountry.php?id=126&regionSelect=5-Southern_Americas|archive-date=September 27, 2013|url-status=dead|df=mdy-all}}</ref> The Guarantors of the [[Rio Protocol]] (Argentina, Brazil, Chile, and the United States of America) ruled that the border of the undelineated zone was to be set at the line of the ''Cordillera del C\u00f3ndor''.

The [[coup d'\u00e9tat]] was led by General [[Guillermo Rodr\u00edguez (politician)|Guillermo Rodr\u00edguez]] and executed by navy commander Jorge Queirolo G. The new president exiled Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Velasco to [[Argentina]]. He remained in power until 1976, when he was removed by another military government. That military junta was led by Admiral [[Alfredo Poveda]], who was declared chairman of the Supreme Council. The Supreme Council included two other members: General Guillermo Dur\u00e1n Arcentales and General Luis Leoro Franco. The civil society more and more insistently called for democratic elections. Colonel [[Richelieu Levoyer]], Government Minister, proposed and implemented a Plan to return to the constitutional system through universal elections. This plan enabled the new democratically elected president to assume the duties of the executive office.\n\n===Return to democracy===\nElections were held on April 29, 1979, under a new constitution. [[Jaime Rold\u00f3s Aguilera]] was elected president, garnering over one million votes, the most in Ecuadorian history. He took office on August 10, as the first constitutionally elected president after nearly a decade of civilian and military dictatorships. In 1980, he founded the ''Partido Pueblo, Cambio y Democracia'' (People, Change, and Democracy Party) after withdrawing from the ''Concentraci\u00f3n de Fuerzas Populares'' (Popular Forces Concentration) and governed until May 24, 1981, when he died along with his wife and the minister of defense, [[Marco Subia Martinez]], when his Air Force plane crashed in heavy rain near the Peruvian border. Many people believe that he was assassinated by the CIA,{{Citation needed|date=February 2009}} given the multiple death threats leveled against him because of his reformist agenda, deaths in automobile crashes of two key witnesses before they could testify during the investigation, and the sometimes contradictory accounts of the incident.\n\nRoldos was immediately succeeded by Vice President Osvaldo Hurtado, who was followed in 1984 by [[Le\u00f3n Febres Cordero]] from the Social Christian Party. [[Rodrigo Borja Cevallos]] of the Democratic Left (Izquierda Democr\u00e1tica, or ID) party won the presidency in 1988, running in the runoff election against [[Abdal\u00e1 Bucaram]] (brother in law of [[Jaime Roldos]] and founder of the Ecuadorian Roldosist Party). His government was committed to improving human rights protection and carried out some reforms, notably an opening of Ecuador to foreign trade. The Borja government concluded an accord leading to the disbanding of the small terrorist group, \"[[\u00a1Alfaro Vive, Carajo!]]\" (\"Alfaro Lives, Dammit!\"), named after [[Eloy Alfaro]]. However, continuing economic problems undermined the popularity of the ID, and opposition parties gained control of Congress in 1999.\n[[File:CAMBIO DE GUARDIA.jpg|thumb|President [[Len\u00edn Moreno]], first lady [[Roc\u00edo Gonz\u00e1lez Navas]] and his predecessor [[Rafael Correa]], 3 April 2017]]\nThe emergence of the Amerindian population as an active constituency has added to the democratic volatility of the country in recent years. The population has been motivated by government failures to deliver on promises of land reform, lower unemployment and provision of social services, and historical exploitation by the land-holding elite. Their movement, along with the continuing destabilizing efforts by both the elite and leftist movements, has led to a deterioration of the executive office. The populace and the other branches of government give the president very little political capital, as illustrated by the most recent removal of President [[Lucio Guti\u00e9rrez]] from office by Congress in April 2005.

Once Gran Colombia was dissolved after the death of [[Sim\u00f3n Bol\u00edvar]] in 1830, Ecuador inherited the same border disputes and had the need of creating its own professional military force. So influential was the military in Ecuador in the early republican period that its first decade was under the control of General [[Juan Jos\u00e9 Flores]], first president of Ecuador of Venezuelan origin. General Jose Ma. Urbina and General Robles are examples of military figures who became presidents of the country in the early republican period.\n\nDue to the continuous border disputes with Peru, finally settled in the early 2000s, and due to the ongoing problem with the Colombian guerrilla insurgency infiltrating Amazonian provinces, the Ecuadorian Armed Forces has gone through a series of changes. In 2009, the new administration at the Defense Ministry launched a deep restructuring within the forces, increasing spending budget to $1,691,776,803, an increase of 25%.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ccmr.org/public/library_file_proxy.cfm/lid/5603 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090506111602/http://www.ccmr.org/public/library_file_proxy.cfm/lid/5603 |archivedate=May 6, 2009 |title=Ecuador: A Comparative Atlas of Defence in Latin America / 2008 Edition|publisher=ccmr.org |accessdate=June 26, 2010}}</ref>\n\nThe icons of the Ecuadorian military forces are Marshall Antonio Jos\u00e9 de Sucre and General [[Eloy Alfaro]].

It is the country's most fertile and productive land, and is the seat of the large [[banana]] exportation plantations of the companies [[Dole Food Company|Dole]] and [[Chiquita]]. This region is also where most of Ecuador's [[rice]] crop is grown. The truly coastal provinces have active fisheries. The largest coastal city is [[Guayaquil]].\n* '''La Sierra''', or \"the highlands\": The sierra consists of the Andean and Interandean highland provinces&nbsp;\u2013 [[Azuay Province|Azuay]], [[Ca\u00f1ar Province|Ca\u00f1ar]], [[Carchi Province|Carchi]], [[Chimborazo Province|Chimborazo]], [[Imbabura Province|Imbabura]], [[Loja Province|Loja]], [[Pichincha Province|Pichincha]], and [[Tungurahua Province|Tungurahua]]. This land contains most of Ecuador's volcanoes and all of its snow-capped peaks. Agriculture is focused on the traditional crops of [[potato]], [[maize]], and [[Quinoa|quinua]] and the population is predominantly Amerindian [[Quechua people|Kichua]]. The largest Sierran city is [[Quito]].\n* '''La Amazon\u00eda''', also known as ''El Oriente'', or \"the east\": The oriente consists of the [[Amazon rainforest|Amazon jungle]] provinces&nbsp;\u2013 [[Morona Santiago Province|Morona Santiago]], [[Napo Province|Napo]], [[Orellana Province|Orellana]], [[Pastaza Province|Pastaza]], [[Sucumb\u00edos Province|Sucumb\u00edos]], and [[Zamora-Chinchipe Province|Zamora-Chinchipe]]. This region is primarily made up of the huge Amazon national parks and Amerindian untouchable zones, which are vast stretches of land set aside for the Amazon Amerindian tribes to continue living traditionally. It is also the area with the largest reserves of [[petroleum]] in Ecuador, and parts of the upper Amazon here have been extensively exploited by petroleum companies. The population is primarily mixed Amerindian [[Shuar]], [[Huaorani]] and [[Quechua people|Kichua]], although there are numerous tribes in the deep jungle which are little-contacted. The largest city in the Oriente is probably [[Nueva Loja|Lago Agrio]] in Sucumb\u00edos, although [[Macas (city)|Macas]] in Morona Santiago runs a close second.\n* '''La Regi\u00f3n Insular''' is the region comprising the [[Gal\u00e1pagos Islands]], some {{convert|1000|km|mi}} west of the mainland in the Pacific Ocean.\n\nEcuador's capital is Quito, which is in the province of [[Pichincha Province, Ecuador|Pichincha]] in the Sierra region.

It is mild year-round in the mountain valleys, with a [[humid subtropical climate]] in coastal areas and [[rainforest]] in lowlands. The Pacific coastal area has a [[tropical climate]] with a severe rainy season. The climate in the Andean highlands is [[Temperateness|temperate]] and relatively dry, and the Amazon basin on the eastern side of the mountains shares the climate of other rainforest zones.\n\nBecause of its location at the equator, Ecuador experiences little variation in daylight hours during the course of a year. Both sunrise and sunset occur each day at the two six o'clock hours.<ref name=CIA/>\n\n===Hydrology===\n{{Main|Rivers of Ecuador}}\n[[File:Canyoning en Ba\u00f1os de Agua Santa.JPG|thumb|left|upright|[[Ba\u00f1os de Agua Santa]] is an important tourist site]]\n\nThe Andes is the ''watershed divisor'' between the [[Amazon Basin|Amazon]] watershed, which runs to the east, and the Pacific, including the north\u2013south rivers Mataje, Santiago, [[Esmeraldas River|Esmeraldas]], [[Chone River|Chone]], [[Guayas River|Guayas]], Jubones, and Puyango-Tumbes.\n\nAlmost all of the rivers in Ecuador form in the Sierra region and flow east toward the [[Amazon River]] or west toward the Pacific Ocean. The rivers rise from snowmelt at the edges of the snowcapped peaks or from the abundant precipitation that falls at higher elevations. In the Sierra region, the streams and rivers are narrow and flow rapidly over precipitous slopes. Rivers may slow and widen as they cross the hoyas yet become rapid again as they flow from the heights of the [[Andes]] to the lower elevations of the other regions. The highland rivers broaden as they enter the more level areas of the Costa and the Oriente.\n\n[[File:Driving the beach salinas ecuador.jpg|thumb|A beach of [[Salinas, Ecuador|Salinas]], [[Santa Elena Province]]]]\nIn the Costa, the external coast has mostly intermittent rivers that are fed by constant rains from December through May and become empty riverbeds during the dry season. The few exceptions are the longer, perennial rivers that flow throughout the external coast from the internal coast and La Sierra on their way to the [[Pacific Ocean]]. The internal coast, by contrast, is crossed by perennial rivers that may flood during the rainy season, sometimes forming swamps.\n\nMajor rivers in the Oriente include the [[Pastaza River|Pastaza]], [[Napo River|Napo]], and [[Putumayo River|Putumayo]]. The Pastaza is formed by the confluence of the Chambo and the Patate rivers, both of which rise in the Sierra. The Pastaza includes the Agoyan waterfall, which at {{convert|61|m|ft|abbr=off|sp=us|spell=in}} is the highest waterfall in Ecuador. The Napo rises near Mount Cotopaxi and is the major river used for transport in the eastern lowlands. The Napo ranges in width from {{convert|500|to|1800|m|ft|abbr=on}}. In its upper reaches, the Napo flows rapidly until the confluence with one of its major tributaries, the Coca River, where it slows and levels off. The Putumayo forms part of the border with Colombia. All of these rivers flow into the [[Amazon River]]. The Gal\u00e1pagos Islands have no significant rivers. Several of the larger islands, however, have freshwater springs although they are surrounded by the Pacific Ocean.\n\n===Biodiversity===\n[[File:Oso andino Porcon.jpg|thumb|left|upright=0.9|Ecuador is one of the most [[megadiverse countries]] in the world, it also has the most biodiversity per square kilometer of any nation, and is one of the highest [[endemism]] worldwide.

The major routes are Pan American (under enhancement from four to six lanes from Rumichaca to Ambato, the conclusion of 4 lanes on the entire stretch of Ambato and Riobamba and running via Riobamba to Loja). In the absence of the section between Loja and the border with Peru, there are the Route Espondilus and/or Ruta del Sol (oriented to travel along the Ecuadorian coastline) and the Amazon backbone (which crosses from north to south along the Ecuadorian Amazon, linking most and more major cities of it).\n\nAnother major project is developing the road Manta \u2013 Tena, the highway Guayaquil \u2013 Salinas Highway Aloag Santo Domingo, Riobamba \u2013 Macas (which crosses Sangay National Park). Other new developments include the National Unity bridge complex in Guayaquil, the bridge over the Napo river in Francisco de Orellana, the Esmeraldas River Bridge in the city of the same name, and, perhaps the most remarkable of all, the Bahia \u2013 San Vincente Bridge, being the largest on the Latin American Pacific coast.\n\n[[Cuenca, Ecuador|Cuenca]]'s tramway is the largest public transport system in the city and the first modern tramway in Ecuador. It was inaugurated on March 8, 2019. It has 20,4&nbsp;km and 27 stations. It will transport 120 000 passagers daily. Its route starts in the south of Cuenca and ends in the north at the Parque Industrial neighbourhood.\n\nThe [[Mariscal Sucre International Airport]] in Quito and the [[Jos\u00e9 Joaqu\u00edn de Olmedo International Airport]] in [[Guayaquil]] have experienced a high increase in demand and have required modernization.

Even though Ecuador's white population during its colonial era were mainly descendants from Spain, today Ecuador's white population is a result of a mixture of European immigrants, predominantly from Spain with people from Italy, Germany, France, and Switzerland who have settled in the early 20th century. Ecuador also has people of middle eastern extraction that have also joined the ranks of the white minority. These include economically well off immigrants of Lebanese and Palestinian descent, who are either Christian or Muslim ([[Islam in Ecuador]]).

The first and most substantial wave of modern immigration to Ecuador consisted of Spanish colonists, following the arrival of Europeans in 1499. A lower number of other Europeans and North Americans migrated to the country in the late 19th and early twentieth centuries and, in smaller numbers, Poles, Lithuanians, English, Irish, and Croats during and after the Second World War.\n\n[[File:Alicia Cahuiya, Caso Tagaeri y Taromenani.jpg|thumb|right|upright|[[Huaorani people|Huaorani]] man with the typical Amazonian indigenous clothes]]\n\nSince African slavery was not the workforce of the Spanish colonies in the Andes Mountains, given the subjugation of the Amerindian people through proselytization and ''[[encomiendas]]'', the minority population of African descent is mostly found in the coastal northern province of Esmeraldas. This is largely owing to the 17th-century shipwreck of a slave-trading galleon off the northern coast of Ecuador. The few black African survivors swam to the shore and penetrated the then-thick jungle under the leadership of Anton, the chief of the group, where they remained as free men maintaining their original culture, not influenced by the typical elements found in other provinces of the coast or in the Andean region. A little later, freed slaves from Colombia known as ''cimarrones'' joined them. In the small Chota Valley of the province of Imbabura exists a small community of Africans among the province's predominantly mestizo population. These blacks are descendants of Africans, who were brought over from Colombia by Jesuits to work their colonial sugar plantations as slaves. As a general rule, small elements of zambos and mulattoes coexisted among the overwhelming mestizo population of coastal Ecuador throughout its history as gold miners in Loja, Zaruma, and Zamora and as shipbuilders and plantation workers around the city of Guayaquil. Today you can find a small community of Africans in the Catamayo valley of the predominantly mestizo population of Loja.\n\nEcuador's Amerindian communities are integrated into the mainstream culture to varying degrees,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.south-images.com/photos-andes-ecuador.htm|title=Photos Indigenous people of Ecuador|author=Elisabeth Hurtel|publisher=South-images.com|accessdate=September 13, 2014|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://archive.today/20120911181907/http://www.south-images.com/photos-andes-ecuador.htm|archivedate=September 11, 2012|df=mdy-all}}</ref> but some may also practice their own native cultures, particularly the more remote Amerindian communities of the [[Amazon basin]]. Spanish is spoken as the first language by more than 90% of the population and as a first or second language by more than 98%. Part of Ecuador's population can speak [[Amerindian]] languages, in some cases as a second language. Two percent of the population speak only Amerindian languages.\n\n===Language===\n{{main|Languages of Ecuador }}\n{{bar box\n|title=Languages in Ecuador<ref name=\"CIAPAPUANEWGUINEA\"/>\n|titlebar=#ddd\n|left1=Language\n|right1=percent\n|float=left\n|bars=\n{{bar percent|[[Spanish language|Spanish]] ([[Castilian Spanish|Castilian]]) |Blue| 93}}\n{{bar percent|[[Quechuan languages|Kichwa]] |Orange|4.1}}\n{{bar percent|Foreign  |Green| 2.2}}\n{{bar percent|Other Indigenous |Red|0.7}}\n}}\n \nMost Ecuadorians speak Spanish as their first language, with its ubiquity permeating and dominating most of the country, though there are many who speak an Amerindian language, such as [[Kichwa]] (also spelt Quichua), which is one of the Quechuan languages and is spoken by approximately 2.5 million people in Ecuador, Bolivia, Colombia, and Peru.<ref>[[Kichwa]] Kichwa language page</ref> Other Amerindian languages spoken in Ecuador include Awapit (spoken by the Aw\u00e1), A'ingae (spoken by the Cofan), Shuar Chicham (spoken by the Shuar), Achuar-Shiwiar (spoken by the Achuar and the Shiwiar), Cha'palaachi (spoken by the Chachi), Tsa'fiki (spoken by the Ts\u00e1chila), Paicoca (spoken by the Siona and Secoya), and Wao Tededeo (spoken by the Waorani). Use of these Amerindian languages are, however, gradually diminishing due to Spanish's widespread use in education. Though most features of Ecuadorian Spanish are universal to the Spanish-speaking world, there are several idiosyncrasies.\n\n===Music===\n{{Main|Music of Ecuador}}\n[[File:Julio jaramillo laurido2.jpg|thumb|right|upright=0.9|[[Julio Jaramillo]] is an icon of the old [[Bolero]] music genre.]]\n\nThe music of Ecuador has a long history. [[Pasillo]] is a genre of indigenous Latin music. In Ecuador it is the \"national genre of music\". Through the years, many cultures have brought their influences together to create new types of music. There are also different kinds of traditional music like albazo, pasacalle, fox incaico, tonada, capishca, [[Bomba (Ecuador)|Bomba]] (highly established in Afro-Ecuadorian societies), and so on. [[Tecnocumbia]] and Rockola are clear examples of the influence of foreign cultures. One of the most traditional forms of dancing in Ecuador is [[Sanjuanito]]. It is originally from northern Ecuador ([[Otavalo (city)|Otavalo]]-Imbabura). Sanjuanito is a type of dance music played during festivities by the mestizo and Amerindian communities. According to the Ecuadorian musicologist Segundo Luis Moreno, Sanjuanito was danced by Amerindian people during San Juan Bautista's birthday. This important date was established by the Spaniards on June 24, coincidentally the same date when Amerindian people celebrated their rituals of [[Inti Raymi]].\n\n===Cuisine===\n{{see also|List of Ecuadorian dishes and foods}}\n{{multiple image\n| align = right\n| image1 = Ceviche ecuador.JPG\n| width1 = 150\n| alt1 = \n| caption1 = \n| image2 = Cuy Guinea Pig Dish SG.jpg\n| width2 = 154\n| alt2 = \n| caption2 = \n| footer = ''Ceviche ecuatoriano'' (Ecuadorian-style [[ceviche]]) and ''Cuy asado'' (grilled [[guinea pig]]) are some of the typical dishes.\n}}\n[[Ecuadorian cuisine]] is diverse, varying with the altitude and associated agricultural conditions. Most regions in Ecuador follow the traditional three-course meal of soup, a course that includes rice and a protein, and then dessert and coffee to finish. Supper is usually lighter and sometimes consists only of coffee or herbal tea with bread.{{citation needed|date=November 2014}}\n\nIn the highland region, pork, chicken, beef, and ''cuy'' (guinea pig) are popular and are served with a variety of grains (especially rice and corn) or potatoes.{{citation needed|date=November 2014}}\n\nIn the coastal region, seafood is very popular, with fish, shrimp, and ''[[ceviche]]'' being key parts of the diet. Generally, ceviches are served with fried plantain ([[chifle]]s y patacones), popcorn, or [[tostada (tortilla)|tostado]]. [[Plantain (cooking)|Plantain]]- and peanut-based dishes are the basis of most coastal meals. Encocados (dishes that contain a coconut sauce) are also very popular. ''[[Churrasco]]'' is a staple food of the coastal region, especially [[Guayaquil]]. ''Arroz con menestra y carne asada'' (rice with beans and grilled beef) is one of the traditional dishes of Guayaquil, as is [[Tostones|fried plantain]], which is often served with it. This region is a leading producer of [[banana]]s, [[cocoa bean]]s (to make chocolate), shrimp, [[tilapia]], [[mango]], and [[Passiflora edulis|passion fruit]], among other products.{{citation needed|date=November 2014}}\n\nIn the Amazon region, a dietary staple is the ''yuca'', elsewhere called [[cassava]]. Many fruits are available in this region, including [[banana]]s, [[Cyphostemma juttae|tree grapes]], and [[Bactris gasipaes|peach palm]]s.{{citation needed|date=November 2014}}\n\n===Literature===\n[[File:Jmontalvo.jpg|thumb|upright|left|[[Juan Montalvo]]]]\n\nEarly literature in colonial Ecuador, as in the rest of Spanish America, was influenced by the [[Spanish Golden Age]]. One of the earliest examples is [[Jacinto Collahuazo]],<ref name =Boceto>Borja, Piedad. [http://revistas.ucm.es/fll/02104547/articulos/ALHI7272110053A.PDF Boceto de Poes\u00eda Ecuatoriana,'Journal de la Academia de Literatura Hispanoamericana', 1972] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110503184150/http://revistas.ucm.es/fll/02104547/articulos/ALHI7272110053A.PDF |date=May 3, 2011 }}</ref> an Amerindian chief of a northern village in today's Ibarra, born in the late 1600s. Despite the early repression and discrimination of the native people by the Spanish, Collahuazo learned to read and write in [[Spanish language|Castilian]], but his work was written in [[Quechua languages|Quechua]]. The use of [[Quipu]] was banned by the Spanish,<ref>Robertson, W.S., ''History of the Latin-American Nations'', 1952</ref> and in order to preserve their work, many Inca poets had to resort to the use of the Latin alphabet to write in their native Quechua language. The history behind the Inca drama \"Ollantay\", the oldest literary piece in existence for any Amerindian language in America,<ref>Karnis, ''Surviving Pre-Columbian Drama'', The Johns Hopkins University Press, 1952</ref> shares some similarities with the work of Collahuazo. Collahuazo was imprisoned and all of his work burned. The existence of his literary work came to light many centuries later, when a crew of masons was restoring the walls of a colonial church in Quito and found a hidden manuscript. The salvaged fragment is a Spanish translation from Quechua of the \"Elegy to the Dead of Atahualpa\",<ref name =Boceto/> a poem written by Collahuazo, which describes the sadness and impotence of the Inca people of having lost their king Atahualpa.\n\nOther early Ecuadorian writers include the Jesuits [[Juan Bautista Aguirre]], born in [[Daule Canton|Daule]] in 1725, and Father [[Juan de Velasco]], born in Riobamba in 1727. De Velasco wrote about the nations and chiefdoms that had existed in the ''Kingdom of Quito'' (today Ecuador) before the arrival of the Spanish. His historical accounts are nationalistic, featuring a romantic perspective of precolonial history.\n\nFamous authors from the late colonial and early republic period include [[Eugenio Espejo]], a printer and main author of the first newspaper in Ecuadorian colonial times; [[Jose Joaquin de Olmedo]] (born in Guayaquil), famous for his ode to [[Sim\u00f3n Bol\u00edvar]] titled ''Victoria de Junin''; [[Juan Montalvo]], a prominent essayist and novelist; [[Juan Leon Mera]], famous for his work \"Cumanda\" or \"Tragedy among Savages\" and the Ecuadorian National Anthem; Juan A.

One exception is \"The Ecuadorian Deception,\" a murder mystery/thriller authored by American Bear Mills. In it, George d'Hout, a website designer from the United States is lured under false pretenses to Guayaquil. A corrupt American archaeologist is behind the plot, believing d'Hout holds the keys to locating a treasure hidden by a buccaneer ancestor. The story is based on a real pirate by the name of George d'Hout who terrorized Guayaquil in the 16th Century.\n\n===Art===\nThe best known art styles from Ecuador belonged to the ''[[Escuela Quite\u00f1a]]'' (Quito School), which developed from the 16th to 18th centuries, examples of which are on display in various old churches in Quito.

The 2002 FIFA World Cup qualifying campaign was considered a huge success for the country and its inhabitants.{{citation needed|date=July 2014}} The unusually high elevation of the home stadium in Quito often affects the performance of visiting teams. Ecuador finished in 2nd place in the [[CONMEBOL]] qualifiers behind [[Argentina national football team|Argentina]] and above the team that would become World Champions, [[Brazil national football team|Brazil]]. In the 2006 FIFA World Cup, Ecuador finished ahead of [[Poland national football team|Poland]] and [[Costa Rica national football team|Costa Rica]] finishing second behind [[Germany national football team|Germany]] in Group A in the 2006 World Cup.

These terminal degrees, as in the case of the PhD in other countries, were the main requirement for an individual to be accepted in academia as a professor or researcher. In the professional realm, a terminal degree granted by an accredited institution automatically provides a professional license to the individual.\n\nHowever, in 2004, the National Council of Higher Education (CONESUP), started the reorganization of all the degree-granting schemes of the accredited universities in order to pair them with foreign counterparts. The new structure of some careers caused the dropping of subjects, credits, or even the name of the previously conferred diplomas. The terminal degree in law, previously known as JD [[Juris Doctor]] (Doctor en Jurisprudencia) was replaced by the one of ''abogado'' (attorney) with the exception of the modification of the number of credits to equate it to an undergraduate degree. In the same fashion for medical school, the required time of education was considerably reduced from nine years (the minimum needed to obtain the title of MD in Medicine and Surgery) to almost five, with the provision that the diploma is not terminal anymore, and it is given with the title of ''m\u00e9dico'' (medic). Therefore, an MD or PhD in medicine is only to be obtained overseas until the universities adjust themselves to granting schemes and curriculum as in foreign counterparts. Nonetheless, a \"m\u00e9dico\" can start a career as family practitioner or general medicine physician.\n\n[[File:SageoEG - Biblioteca Municipal de Guayaquil 001.jpg|thumb|upright=0.9|[[Biblioteca Municipal de Guayaquil|Municipal Library of Guayaquil]]]]\n\nThis new reorganization, although very ambitious, lacked the proper path to the homologation of diplomas for highly educated professionals graduated in the country or even for the ones graduated in foreign institutions. One of the points of conflict was the imposition of obtaining foreign degrees to current academicians. As today, a master's degree is a requirement to keep an academic position and at least a foreign PhD to attain or retain the status of ''rector'' (president of a university) or ''d\u00e9cano'' (dean). For Ecuadorian researchers and many academicians trained in the country, these regulations sounded illogical, disappointing, and unlawful since it appeared a question of a title name conflict rather than specialization or science advancement.\n\nA debate to modify this and other reforms, especially the one which granted control of the Higher Education System by the government, was practically passed with consensus by the multi-partisan National Assembly on August 4, 2010, but vetoed by President [[Rafael Correa]], who wanted to keep the law strictly as it was originally redacted by his political party and SENPLADES (National Secretary of Planning and Development). Due to this change, there are many highly educated professionals and academicians under the old structure but estimated that only 87% of the faculty in public universities have already obtained a master's degree, and fewer than 5% have a PhD (although many of them already have Ecuadorian-granted doctorate degrees).\n\nAbout 300 institutes of higher education offer two to three years of post-secondary vocational or technical training.\n\n==Sciences and research==\n[[File:NEE-01-PEGASO.jpg|left|thumb|[[Ecuadorian Civilian Space Agency|EXA]]'s first satellite, [[NEE-01 Pegasus]]]]\n\nEcuador is currently placed in 96th position of innovation in technology.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20131104000235/http://elcomercio.com/sociedad/Tecnologia-innovacion-emprendimiento-emprendedores-Ecuador-desarrollo-nuevasTecnologias_0_995900422.html Ecuador ocupa el puesto 96 en innovaci\u00f3n tecnol\u00f3gica]. elcomercio.com.

Between 100 BC and 100 AD. Found in [[Esmeraldas, Ecuador|Esmeraldas]]]]\nVarious peoples had settled in the area of future Ecuador before the arrival of the [[Incas]]. The archeological evidence suggests that the [[Paleo-Indians]]' first dispersal into the Americas occurred near the end of the [[last glacial period]], around 16,500\u201313,000 years ago. The first Indians who reached Ecuador may have journeyed by land from North and Central America or by boat down the [[Pacific Ocean]] coastline. Much later migrations to Ecuador may have come via the Amazon tributaries, others descended from northern [[South America]], and others ascended from the southern part of South America through the Andes. They developed different languages while emerging as unique ethnic groups.\n\nEven though their languages were unrelated, these groups developed similar groups of cultures, each based in different environments. The people of the coast developed a fishing, hunting, and gathering culture; the people of the highland Andes developed a sedentary agricultural way of life, and the people of the Amazon basin developed a nomadic hunting-and-gathering mode of existence.\n\nOver time these groups began to interact and intermingle with each other so that groups of families in one area became one community or tribe, with a similar language and culture. Many civilizations arose in Ecuador, such as the [[Valdivia Culture]] and [[Machalilla Culture]] on the coast, the [[Quitus]] (near present-day Quito), and the [[Ca\u00f1ari]] (near present-day [[Cuenca, Ecuador|Cuenca]]). Each civilization developed its own distinctive architecture, pottery, and religious interests.\n\nIn the highland Andes mountains, where life was more sedentary, groups of tribes cooperated and formed villages; thus the first nations based on agricultural resources and the domestication of animals formed. Eventually, through wars and marriage alliances of their [[leader]]s, a group of nations formed confederations. One region consolidated under a confederation called the [[Shyris]], which exercised organized trading and bartering between the different regions. Its political and military power came under the rule of the Duchicela blood-line.\n\n===Inca era===\n[[File:Ecuador ingapirca inca ruins.jpg|thumb|Ruins of [[Ingapirca]], this site served as an outpost and provisioning of the Incan troops, but mainly it was a place of worship and veneration to the sun, the supreme Inca God, thus constituting a [[Coricancha]], dedicated to the Inca ritual.]]\n[[File:M\u00famia de cabe\u00e7a - Povo Jivaro 01.jpg|thumb|upright|Pre-Hispanic shrunken head of the [[Shuar]]s ([[Jivaroan peoples]]).]]\nWhen the [[Incas]] arrived, they found that these confederations were so developed that it took the Incas two generations of rulers\u2014[[Topa Inca Yupanqui]] and [[Huayna Capac]]\u2014to absorb them into the [[Inca Empire]]. The native confederations that gave them the most problems were deported to distant areas of Peru, Bolivia, and north Argentina. Similarly, a number of loyal Inca subjects from Peru and Bolivia were brought to Ecuador to prevent rebellion. Thus, the region of highland Ecuador became part of the [[Inca Empire]] in 1463 sharing the same language.\n\nIn contrast, when the Incas made incursions into coastal Ecuador and the eastern Amazon jungles of Ecuador, they found both the environment and indigenous people more hostile. Moreover, when the Incas tried to subdue them, these indigenous people withdrew to the interior and resorted to [[guerrilla]] tactics. As a result, Inca expansion into the Amazon Basin and the Pacific coast of Ecuador was hampered. The indigenous people of the Amazon jungle and coastal Ecuador remained relatively autonomous until the Spanish soldiers and missionaries arrived in force. The Amazonian people and the [[Chachi people|Cayapas]] of Coastal Ecuador were the only groups to resist Inca and Spanish domination, maintaining their language and culture well into the 21st century.\n\nBefore the arrival of the Spaniards, the Inca Empire was involved in a [[Inca Civil War|civil war]]. The untimely death of both the heir Ninan Cuchi and the Emperor Huayna Capac, from a European disease that spread into Ecuador, created a power vacuum between two factions. The northern faction headed by Atahualpa claimed that Huayna Capac gave a verbal decree before his death about how the empire should be divided. He gave the territories pertaining to present-day Ecuador and northern Peru to his favorite son Atahualpa, who was to rule from Quito; and he gave the rest to [[Hu\u00e1scar]], who was to rule from [[Cuzco]]. He willed that his heart be buried in Quito, his favorite city, and the rest of his body be buried with his ancestors in Cuzco.\n\nHu\u00e1scar did not recognize his father's will, since it did not follow Inca traditions of naming an Inca through the priests. Hu\u00e1scar ordered Atahualpa to attend their father's burial in Cuzco and pay homage to him as the new Inca ruler. Atahualpa, with a large number of his father's veteran soldiers, decided to ignore Hu\u00e1scar, and a civil war ensued. A number of bloody battles took place until finally Hu\u00e1scar was captured. Atahualpa marched south to Cuzco and massacred the royal family associated with his brother.\n\nIn 1532, a small band of Spaniards headed by Francisco Pizarro landed in Tumbez and marched over the Andes Mountains until they reached Cajamarca, where the new Inca Atahualpa was to hold an interview with them. Valverde, the priest, tried to convince Atahualpa that he should join the Catholic Church and declare himself a vassal of Spain. This infuriated Atahualpa so much that he threw the Bible to the ground. At this point the enraged Spaniards, with orders from Valverde, attacked and massacred unarmed escorts of the Inca and captured Atahualpa. [[Pizarro]] promised to release Atahualpa if he made good his promise of filling a room full of gold. But, after a mock trial, the Spaniards executed Atahualpa by strangulation.\n\n===Spanish rule===\n[[File:Plaza principal de Quito, an\u00f3nimo - siglo XVIII (Museo de la Moneda, Bogot\u00e1).jpg|thumb|Major square of Quito.

At the same time, the natives were forced into the ''[[encomienda]]'' labor system for the Spanish. In 1563, [[Quito]] became the seat of a [[Royal Audience of Quito|real audiencia]] (administrative district) of Spain and part of the [[Viceroyalty of Peru]] and later the [[Viceroyalty of New Granada]].\n\nThe [[1797 Riobamba earthquake]], which caused up to 40,000 casualties, was studied by [[Alexander von Humboldt]], when he visited the area in 1801\u20131802.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Lavilla|first=E.O.|year=2004|title=Under the Southern Cross: Stories around Humboldt and Bonpland's trip to the New Continent|journal=Latin American Applied Research|volume=34|pages=203\u2013208|url=http://www.scielo.org.ar/pdf/laar/v34n4/v34n4a01.pdf|accessdate=22 August 2010}}</ref>\n\nAfter nearly 300 years of Spanish rule, Quito was still a small city numbering 10,000 inhabitants. On August 10, 1809, the city's ''[[Criollo people|criollos]]'' called for independence from Spain (first among the peoples of Latin America). They were led by Juan P\u00edo Mont\u00fafar, Quiroga, Salinas, and Bishop Cuero y Caicedo. Quito's nickname, \"''[[Luz de Am\u00e9rica]]''\" (\"Light of America\"), is based on its leading role in trying to secure an independent, local government. Although the new government lasted no more than two months, it had important repercussions and was an inspiration for the independence movement of the rest of Spanish America. August 10 is now celebrated as Independence Day, a [[Public holidays in Ecuador|national holiday]].<ref>{{Cite news |url=https://www.eltelegrafo.com.ec/noticias/editoriales/19/ecuador-en-el-dia-de-la-independencia-nacional |title=Ecuador en el d\u00eda de la Independencia nacional |date=2017-08-10 |work=El Tel\u00e9grafo |access-date=2018-08-08 |language=es-es |df=mdy-all |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180808202916/https://www.eltelegrafo.com.ec/noticias/editoriales/19/ecuador-en-el-dia-de-la-independencia-nacional |archive-date=August 8, 2018 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\n===Independence===\n{{Main|Ecuadorian War of Independence}}\n[[File:Jose Antonio de Sucre.JPG|thumb|upright|Venezuelan independence leader [[Antonio Jos\u00e9 de Sucre]]]]\n[[File:Entrevista de Guayaquil.jpg|thumb|upright|The \"[[Guayaquil Conference]]\" was the meeting between the two main Hispanic South American independence leaders.

Its inhabitants celebrated what is now Ecuador's official Independence Day on May 24, 1822. The rest of Ecuador gained its independence after [[Antonio Jos\u00e9 de Sucre]] defeated the Spanish Royalist forces at the [[Battle of Pichincha]], near [[Quito]]. Following the battle, Ecuador joined [[Sim\u00f3n Bol\u00edvar]]'s [[Republic of Gran Colombia]], also including modern-day [[Colombia]], [[Venezuela]] and [[Panama]]. In 1830, Ecuador separated from Gran Colombia and became an independent republic.\n\nThe 19th century was marked by instability for Ecuador with a rapid succession of rulers. The first president of Ecuador was the Venezuelan-born [[Juan Jos\u00e9 Flores]], who was ultimately deposed, followed by several authoritarian leaders, such as [[Vicente Rocafuerte]]; [[Jos\u00e9 Joaqu\u00edn de Olmedo]]; [[Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Urbina]]; [[Diego Noboa]]; [[Pedro Jos\u00e9 de Arteta]]; [[Manuel de Asc\u00e1subi]]; and Flores's own son, [[Antonio Flores Jij\u00f3n]], among others. The conservative [[Gabriel Garcia Moreno]] unified the country in the 1860s with the support of the Roman Catholic Church. In the late 19th century, world demand for [[Cocoa bean|cocoa]] tied the economy to commodity exports and led to migrations from the highlands to the agricultural frontier on the coast.\n\nEcuador [[Abolition of slavery timeline|abolished]] [[Slavery in Latin America|slavery]] and freed its black slaves in 1851.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cidcm.umd.edu/mar/assessment.asp?groupId=13001 |title=Assessment for Blacks in Ecuador |publisher=CIDCM |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120622220302/http://www.cidcm.umd.edu/mar/assessment.asp?groupId=13001 |archivedate=June 22, 2012 |df=mdy }}</ref>\n\n===Liberal Revolution===\n[[File:Historic Center of Quito - World Heritage Site by UNESCO - Photo 437.jpg|thumb|Antique [[Dugout (boat)|dug out canoes]] in the courtyard of the Old Military Hospital in the [[Historic Center of Quito]]]]\n{{Main|Liberal Revolution of 1895}}\nThe Liberal Revolution of 1895 under [[Eloy Alfaro]] reduced the power of the clergy and the conservative land owners. This liberal wing retained power until the military \"Julian Revolution\" of 1925. The 1930s and 1940s were marked by instability and emergence of populist politicians, such as five-time President [[Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Velasco Ibarra]].\n\n===Loss of claimed territories since 1830===\n{{Main|History of the Ecuadorian\u2013Peruvian territorial dispute}}\n{{Campaignbox Ecuadorian-Peruvian}}\n\n====President Juan Jos\u00e9 Flores de jure territorial claims====\nSince Ecuador's separation from Colombia in May 13, 1830, its first President, General [[Juan Jos\u00e9 Flores]], laid claim to the territory that was called the [[Real Audiencia of Quito]], also referred to as the Presidencia of Quito. He supported his claims with Spanish Royal decrees or ''Real Cedulas'', that delineated the borders of Spain's former overseas colonies. In the case of Ecuador, Flores-based Ecuador's ''[[de jure]]'' claims on the following cedulas - Real Cedula of 1563, 1739, and 1740; with modifications in the Amazon Basin and Andes Mountains that were introduced through the Treaty of Guayaquil (1829) which Peru reluctantly signed, after the overwhelmingly outnumbered Gran Colombian force led by [[Antonio Jos\u00e9 de Sucre]] defeated President and General La Mar's Peruvian invasion force in the [[Battle of Tarqui]]. In addition, Ecuador's eastern border with the Portuguese colony of [[Brazil]] in the Amazon Basin was modified before the wars of Independence by the [[First Treaty of San Ildefonso]] (1777) between the [[Spanish Empire]] and the [[Portuguese Empire]]. Moreover, to add legitimacy to his claims, on February 16, 1840, Flores signed a treaty with Spain, whereby Flores convinced Spain to officially recognize Ecuadorian independence and its sole rights to colonial titles over Spain's former colonial territory known anciently to Spain as the Kingdom and Presidency of Quito.\n\nEcuador during its long and turbulent history has lost most of its contested territories to each of its more powerful neighbors, such as Colombia in 1832 and 1916, Brazil in 1904 through a series of peaceful treaties, and Peru after a short war in which the Protocol of Rio de Janeiro was signed in 1942.\n\n====Struggle for independence====\nDuring the [[Spanish American wars of independence|struggle for independence]], before Peru or Ecuador became independent nations, a few areas of the former Vice Royalty of New Granada - Guayaquil, Tumbez, and Ja\u00e9n - declared themselves independent from Spain. A few months later, a part of the Peruvian liberation army of San Martin decided to occupy the independent cities of Tumbez and Ja\u00e9n with the intention of using these towns as springboards to occupy the independent city of Guayaquil and then to liberate the rest of the Audiencia de Quito (Ecuador). It was common knowledge among the top officers of the liberation army from the south that their leader [[Jos\u00e9 de San Mart\u00edn|San Martin]] wished to liberate present-day Ecuador and add it to the future republic of Peru, since it had been part of the Inca Empire before the Spaniards conquered it.\n\nHowever, [[Sim\u00f3n Bol\u00edvar|Bol\u00edvar]]'s intention was to form a new republic known as the Gran Colombia, out of the liberated Spanish territory of New Granada which consisted of Colombia, Venezuela, and Ecuador. San Martin's plans were thwarted when [[Sim\u00f3n Bol\u00edvar|Bol\u00edvar]], with the help of Marshal Antonio Jos\u00e9 de Sucre and the Gran Colombian liberation force, descended from the Andes mountains and occupied Guayaquil; they also annexed the newly liberated Audiencia de Quito to the Republic of [[Gran Colombia]]. This happened a few days before San Martin's Peruvian forces could arrive and occupy Guayaquil, with the intention of annexing Guayaquil to the rest of Audiencia of Quito (Ecuador) and to the future republic of Peru. Historic documents repeatedly stated that San Martin told Bolivar he came to Guayaquil to liberate the land of the Incas from Spain. Bolivar countered by sending a message from Guayaquil welcoming San Martin and his troops to Colombian soil.\n\n====Peruvian occupation of Ja\u00e9n, Tumbes, and Guayaquil====\nIn the south, Ecuador had ''de jure'' claims to a small piece of land beside the Pacific Ocean known as [[Tumbes Region|Tumbes]] which lay between the [[Zarumilla River|Zarumilla]] and [[Tumbes River|Tumbes]] rivers. In Ecuador's southern Andes Mountain region where the Mara\u00f1on cuts across, Ecuador had ''de jure'' claims to an area it called [[Ja\u00e9n, Peru|Ja\u00e9n de Bracamoros]]. These areas were included as part of the territory of Gran Colombia by Bolivar on December 17, 1819, during the [[Congress of Angostura]] when the Republic of Gran Colombia was created. Tumbes declared itself independent from Spain on January 17, 1821, and Jaen de Bracamoros on June 17, 1821, without any outside help from revolutionary armies. However, that same year, 1821, Peruvian forces participating in the Trujillo revolution occupied both Jaen and Tumbes. Some Peruvian generals, without any legal titles backing them up and with Ecuador still federated with the Gran Colombia, had the desire to annex Ecuador to the Republic of Peru at the expense of the Gran Colombia, feeling that Ecuador was once part of the Inca Empire.\n\nOn July 28, 1821, Peruvian independence was proclaimed in Lima by the Liberator San Martin, and Tumbes and Jaen, which were included as part of the revolution of Trujillo by the Peruvian occupying force, had the whole region swear allegiance to the new Peruvian flag and incorporated itself into Peru, even though Peru was not completely liberated from Spain. After Peru was completely liberated from Spain by the patriot armies led by Bolivar and Antonio Jose de Sucre at the [[Battle of Ayacucho]] dated December 9, 1824, there was a strong desire by some Peruvians to resurrect the [[Inca Empire]] and to include Bolivia and Ecuador. One of these Peruvian Generals was the Ecuadorian-born [[Jos\u00e9 de La Mar]], who became one of Peru's presidents after Bolivar resigned as dictator of Peru and returned to Colombia. Gran Colombia had always protested Peru for the return of Jaen and Tumbes for almost a decade, then finally Bolivar after long and futile discussion over the return of Jaen, Tumbes, and part of Mainas, declared war. President and General [[Jos\u00e9 de La Mar]], who was born in Ecuador, believing his opportunity had come to annex the District of Ecuador to Peru, personally, with a Peruvian force, invaded and occupied Guayaquil and a few cities in the Loja region of southern Ecuador on November 28, 1828.\n\nThe war ended when a triumphant heavily outnumbered southern Gran Colombian army at [[Battle of Tarqui]] dated February 27, 1829, led by [[Antonio Jos\u00e9 de Sucre]], defeated the Peruvian invasion force led by President La Mar. This defeat led to the signing of the Treaty of Guayaquil dated September 22, 1829, whereby Peru and its Congress recognized Gran Colombian rights over Tumbes, Jaen, and Maynas. Through protocolized meetings between representatives of Peru and Gran Colombia, the border was set as Tumbes river in the west and in the east the Maranon and Amazon rivers were to be followed toward Brazil as the most natural borders between them. However, what was pending was whether the new border around the Jaen region should follow the Chinchipe River or the Huancabamba River. According to the peace negotiations Peru agreed to return Guayaquil, Tumbez, and Ja\u00e9n; despite this, Peru returned Guayaquil, but failed to return Tumbes and Ja\u00e9n, alleging that it was not obligated to follow the agreements, since the Gran Colombia ceased to exist when it divided itself into three different nations - Ecuador, Colombia, and Venezuela.\n\n====The dissolution of Gran Colombia====\n[[File:AGHRC (1890) - Carta XI - Divisi\u00f3n pol\u00edtica de Colombia, 1824.jpg|thumb|Map of the former [[Gran Colombia]] in 1824 (named in its time as Colombia), the Gran Colombia covered all the colored region.]]\n[[File:Ecuador1832.png|thumb|Ecuador in 1832]]\n\nThe Central District of the Gran Colombia, known as Cundinamarca or New Granada (modern Colombia) with its capital in Bogota, did not recognize the separation of the Southern District of the Gran Colombia, with its capital in Quito, from the Gran Colombian federation on May 13, 1830. After Ecuador's separation, the [[Department of Cauca]] voluntarily decided to unite itself with Ecuador due to instability in the central government of Bogota. The Venezuelan born President of Ecuador, the general [[Juan Jos\u00e9 Flores]], with the approval of the Ecuadorian congress annexed the Department of Cauca on December 20, 1830, since the government of Cauca had called for union with the District of the South as far back as April 1830. Moreover, the Cauca region, throughout its long history, had very strong economic and cultural ties with the people of Ecuador. Also, the Cauca region, which included such cities as [[Pasto, Colombia|Pasto]], [[Popay\u00e1n]], and [[Buenaventura, Valle del Cauca|Buenaventura]], had always been dependent on the Presidencia or Audiencia of Quito.\n\nFruitless negotiations continued between the governments of Bogot\u00e1 and Quito, where the government of Bogot\u00e1 did not recognize the separation of Ecuador or that of Cauca from the Gran Colombia until war broke out in May 1832. In five months, New Granada defeated Ecuador due to the fact that the majority of the Ecuadorian Armed Forces were composed of rebellious angry unpaid veterans from Venezuela and Colombia that did not want to fight against their fellow countrymen. Seeing that his officers were rebelling, mutinying, and changing sides, President Flores had no option but to reluctantly make peace with New Granada. The Treaty of Pasto of 1832 was signed by which the Department of Cauca was turned over to New Granada (modern Colombia), the government of Bogot\u00e1 recognized Ecuador as an independent country and the border was to follow the Ley de Divisi\u00f3n Territorial de la Rep\u00fablica de Colombia (Law of the Division of Territory of the Gran Colombia) passed on June 25, 1824. This law set the border at the river Carchi and the eastern border that stretched to Brazil at the Caquet\u00e1 river. Later, Ecuador contended that the Republic of Colombia, while reorganizing its government, unlawfully made its eastern border provisional and that Colombia extended its claims south to the Napo River because it said that the Government of Popay\u00e1n extended its control all the way to the Napo River.\n\n====Struggle for possession of the Amazon Basin====\n[[File:South America 1879.png|thumb|left|South America (1879): All land claims by Peru, Ecuador, Colombia, Brazil, Argentina, Chile, and Bolivia in 1879]]\nWhen Ecuador seceded from the Gran Colombia, Peru decided not to follow the treaty of Guayaquil of 1829 or the protocoled agreements made. Peru contested Ecuador's claims with the newly discovered ''Real Cedula'' of 1802, by which Peru claims the King of Spain had transferred these lands from the Viceroyalty of New Granada to the Viceroyalty of Peru. During colonial times this was to halt the ever-expanding Portuguese settlements into Spanish domains, which were left vacant and in disorder after the expulsion of Jesuit missionaries from their bases along the Amazon Basin. Ecuador countered by labeling the Cedula of 1802 an ecclesiastical instrument, which had nothing to do with political borders. Peru began its de facto occupation of disputed Amazonian territories, after it signed a secret 1851 peace treaty in favor of Brazil. This treaty disregarded Spanish rights that were confirmed during colonial times by a Spanish-Portuguese treaty over the Amazon regarding territories held by illegal Portuguese settlers.\n\nPeru began occupying the defenseless missionary villages in the Mainas or Maynas region, which it began calling Loreto, with its capital in [[Iquitos]]. During its negotiations with Brazil, Peru stated that based on the royal cedula of 1802, it claimed Amazonian Basin territories up to Caqueta River in the north and toward the Andes Mountain range, depriving Ecuador and Colombia of all their claims to the Amazon Basin. Colombia protested stating that its claims extended south toward the Napo and Amazon Rivers. Ecuador protested that it claimed the Amazon Basin between the Caqueta river and the Mara\u00f1on-Amazon river. Peru ignored these protests and created the Department of Loreto in 1853 with its capital in Iquitos which it had recently invaded and systematically began to occupy using the river systems in all the territories claimed by both Colombia and Ecuador. Peru briefly occupied Guayaquil again in 1860, since Peru thought that Ecuador was selling some of the disputed land for development to British bond holders, but returned Guayaquil after a few months. The border dispute was then submitted to Spain for arbitration from 1880 to 1910, but to no avail.\n\nIn the early part of the 20th century, Ecuador made an effort to peacefully define its eastern Amazonian borders with its neighbours through negotiation. On May 6, 1904, Ecuador signed the Tobar-Rio Branco Treaty recognizing Brazil's claims to the Amazon in recognition of Ecuador's claim to be an Amazonian country to counter Peru's earlier Treaty with Brazil back in October 23, 1851. Then after a few meetings with the Colombian government's representatives an agreement was reached and the Mu\u00f1oz Vernaza-Suarez Treaty was signed July 15, 1916, in which Colombian rights to the Putumayo river were recognized as well as Ecuador's rights to the Napo river and the new border was a line that ran midpoint between those two rivers. In this way, Ecuador gave up the claims it had to the Amazonian territories between the Caquet\u00e1 River and Napo River to Colombia, thus cutting itself off from Brazil. Later, a brief war erupted between Colombia and Peru, over Peru's claims to the Caquet\u00e1 region, which ended with Peru reluctantly signing the Salomon-Lozano Treaty on March 24, 1922. Ecuador protested this secret treaty, since Colombia gave away Ecuadorian claimed land to Peru that Ecuador had given to Colombia in 1916.\n\nIn July 21, 1924, the Ponce-Castro Oyanguren Protocol was signed between Ecuador and Peru where both agreed to hold direct negotiations and to resolve the dispute in an equitable manner and to submit the differing points of the dispute to the United States for arbitration. Negotiations between the Ecuadorian and Peruvian representatives began in Washington on September 30, 1935. These negotiations were long and tiresome. Both sides logically presented their cases, but no one seemed to give up their claims. Then on February 6, 1937, Ecuador presented a transactional line which Peru rejected the next day. The negotiations turned into intense arguments during the next 7 months and finally on September 29, 1937, the Peruvian representatives decided to break off the negotiations without submitting the dispute to arbitration because the direct negotiations were going nowhere.\n\nFour years later in 1941, amid fast-growing tensions within disputed territories around the Zarumilla River, war broke out with Peru. Peru claimed that Ecuador's military presence in Peruvian-claimed territory was an invasion; Ecuador, for its part, claimed that Peru had recently invaded Ecuador around the Zarumilla River and that Peru since Ecuador's independence from Spain has systematically occupied Tumbez, Jaen, and most of the disputed territories in the Amazonian Basin between the Putomayo and Mara\u00f1on Rivers. In July 1941, troops were mobilized in both countries. Peru had an army of 11,681 troops who faced a poorly supplied and inadequately armed Ecuadorian force of 2,300, of which only 1,300 were deployed in the southern provinces. Hostilities erupted on July 5, 1941, when Peruvian forces crossed the Zarumilla river at several locations, testing the strength and resolve of the Ecuadorian border troops. Finally, on July 23, 1941, the Peruvians launched a major invasion, crossing the Zarumilla river in force and advancing into the Ecuadorian province of [[El Oro Province|El Oro]].\n\n[[File:Ecuador-peru-land-claims-01.png|thumb|left|Map of Ecuadorian land claims after 1916]]\n\nDuring the course of the [[Ecuadorian\u2013Peruvian War]], Peru gained control over part of the disputed territory and some parts of the province of El Oro, and some parts of the [[Loja Province|province of Loja]], demanding that the Ecuadorian government give up its territorial claims. The Peruvian Navy blocked the port of [[Guayaquil]], almost cutting all supplies to the Ecuadorian troops. After a few weeks of war and under pressure by the United States and several Latin American nations, all fighting came to a stop. Ecuador and Peru came to an accord formalized in the [[Rio Protocol]], signed on January 29, 1942, in favor of hemispheric unity against the [[Axis Powers]] in [[World War II]] favouring Peru with the territory they occupied at the time the war came to an end.\n\nThe 1944 [[Glorious May Revolution]] followed a military-civilian rebellion and a subsequent civic strike which successfully removed Carlos Arroyo del R\u00edo as a dictator from Ecuador's government. However, a post-Second World War recession and popular unrest led to a return to populist politics and domestic military interventions in the 1960s, while foreign companies developed oil resources in the Ecuadorian Amazon. In 1972, construction of the Andean pipeline was completed. The pipeline brought oil from the east side of the Andes to the coast, making Ecuador South America's second largest oil exporter. The pipeline in southern Ecuador did nothing to resolve tensions between Ecuador and Peru, however.\n\n[[File:Relevo-ecu.JPG|thumb|Ecuadorian troops during the [[Cenepa War]]]]\n[[File:Mirage F.1JA.JPG|thumb|The [[Dassault Mirage F1|Mirage F.1JA]] (FAE-806) was one aircraft involved in the claimed shooting down of two Peruvian [[Sukhoi Su-22]] on February 10, 1995.]]\nThe [[Rio Protocol]] failed to precisely resolve the border along a little river in the remote ''Cordillera del C\u00f3ndor'' region in southern Ecuador. This caused a long-simmering dispute between Ecuador and Peru, which ultimately led to fighting between the two countries; first a border skirmish in January\u2013February 1981 known as the [[Paquisha Incident]], and ultimately full-scale warfare in January 1995 where the Ecuadorian military shot down Peruvian aircraft and helicopters and Peruvian infantry marched into southern Ecuador. Each country blamed the other for the onset of hostilities, known as the [[Cenepa War]]. [[Sixto Dur\u00e1n Ball\u00e9n]], the Ecuadorian president, famously declared that he would not give up a single centimeter of Ecuador. Popular sentiment in Ecuador became strongly [[nationalism|nationalistic]] against Peru: graffiti could be seen on the walls of Quito referring to Peru as the \"''Cain de Latinoam\u00e9rica''\", a reference to the murder of [[Abel]] by his brother [[Cain]] in the [[Book of Genesis]].<ref>Roos, Wilma and van Renterghem, Omer ''Ecuador'', New York, 2000, p.5.</ref>\n\nEcuador and Peru signed the [[Brasilia Presidential Act]] peace agreement on October 26, 1998, which ended hostilities, and effectively put an end to the Western Hemisphere's longest running territorial dispute.<ref name=\"ucdp.uu.se\">{{cite web|title=Uppsala Conflict Data Program - Conflict Encyclopedia, General Conflict Information, Conflict name: Ecuador - Peru, In depth, Background to the 1995 fighting and Ecuador and Peru engage in armed conflict|accessdate=July 15, 2013|url=http://www.ucdp.uu.se/gpdatabase/gpcountry.php?id=126&regionSelect=5-Southern_Americas#|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130927150723/http://www.ucdp.uu.se/gpdatabase/gpcountry.php?id=126&regionSelect=5-Southern_Americas|archive-date=September 27, 2013|url-status=dead|df=mdy-all}}</ref> The Guarantors of the [[Rio Protocol]] (Argentina, Brazil, Chile, and the United States of America) ruled that the border of the undelineated zone was to be set at the line of the ''Cordillera del C\u00f3ndor''.

The [[coup d'\u00e9tat]] was led by General [[Guillermo Rodr\u00edguez (politician)|Guillermo Rodr\u00edguez]] and executed by navy commander Jorge Queirolo G. The new president exiled Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Velasco to [[Argentina]]. He remained in power until 1976, when he was removed by another military government. That military junta was led by Admiral [[Alfredo Poveda]], who was declared chairman of the Supreme Council. The Supreme Council included two other members: General Guillermo Dur\u00e1n Arcentales and General Luis Leoro Franco. The civil society more and more insistently called for democratic elections. Colonel [[Richelieu Levoyer]], Government Minister, proposed and implemented a Plan to return to the constitutional system through universal elections. This plan enabled the new democratically elected president to assume the duties of the executive office.\n\n===Return to democracy===\nElections were held on April 29, 1979, under a new constitution. [[Jaime Rold\u00f3s Aguilera]] was elected president, garnering over one million votes, the most in Ecuadorian history. He took office on August 10, as the first constitutionally elected president after nearly a decade of civilian and military dictatorships. In 1980, he founded the ''Partido Pueblo, Cambio y Democracia'' (People, Change, and Democracy Party) after withdrawing from the ''Concentraci\u00f3n de Fuerzas Populares'' (Popular Forces Concentration) and governed until May 24, 1981, when he died along with his wife and the minister of defense, [[Marco Subia Martinez]], when his Air Force plane crashed in heavy rain near the Peruvian border. Many people believe that he was assassinated by the CIA,{{Citation needed|date=February 2009}} given the multiple death threats leveled against him because of his reformist agenda, deaths in automobile crashes of two key witnesses before they could testify during the investigation, and the sometimes contradictory accounts of the incident.\n\nRoldos was immediately succeeded by Vice President Osvaldo Hurtado, who was followed in 1984 by [[Le\u00f3n Febres Cordero]] from the Social Christian Party. [[Rodrigo Borja Cevallos]] of the Democratic Left (Izquierda Democr\u00e1tica, or ID) party won the presidency in 1988, running in the runoff election against [[Abdal\u00e1 Bucaram]] (brother in law of [[Jaime Roldos]] and founder of the Ecuadorian Roldosist Party). His government was committed to improving human rights protection and carried out some reforms, notably an opening of Ecuador to foreign trade. The Borja government concluded an accord leading to the disbanding of the small terrorist group, \"[[\u00a1Alfaro Vive, Carajo!]]\" (\"Alfaro Lives, Dammit!\"), named after [[Eloy Alfaro]]. However, continuing economic problems undermined the popularity of the ID, and opposition parties gained control of Congress in 1999.\n[[File:CAMBIO DE GUARDIA.jpg|thumb|President [[Len\u00edn Moreno]], first lady [[Roc\u00edo Gonz\u00e1lez Navas]] and his predecessor [[Rafael Correa]], 3 April 2017]]\nThe emergence of the Amerindian population as an active constituency has added to the democratic volatility of the country in recent years. The population has been motivated by government failures to deliver on promises of land reform, lower unemployment and provision of social services, and historical exploitation by the land-holding elite. Their movement, along with the continuing destabilizing efforts by both the elite and leftist movements, has led to a deterioration of the executive office. The populace and the other branches of government give the president very little political capital, as illustrated by the most recent removal of President [[Lucio Guti\u00e9rrez]] from office by Congress in April 2005.

Once Gran Colombia was dissolved after the death of [[Sim\u00f3n Bol\u00edvar]] in 1830, Ecuador inherited the same border disputes and had the need of creating its own professional military force. So influential was the military in Ecuador in the early republican period that its first decade was under the control of General [[Juan Jos\u00e9 Flores]], first president of Ecuador of Venezuelan origin. General Jose Ma. Urbina and General Robles are examples of military figures who became presidents of the country in the early republican period.\n\nDue to the continuous border disputes with Peru, finally settled in the early 2000s, and due to the ongoing problem with the Colombian guerrilla insurgency infiltrating Amazonian provinces, the Ecuadorian Armed Forces has gone through a series of changes. In 2009, the new administration at the Defense Ministry launched a deep restructuring within the forces, increasing spending budget to $1,691,776,803, an increase of 25%.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ccmr.org/public/library_file_proxy.cfm/lid/5603 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090506111602/http://www.ccmr.org/public/library_file_proxy.cfm/lid/5603 |archivedate=May 6, 2009 |title=Ecuador: A Comparative Atlas of Defence in Latin America / 2008 Edition|publisher=ccmr.org |accessdate=June 26, 2010}}</ref>\n\nThe icons of the Ecuadorian military forces are Marshall Antonio Jos\u00e9 de Sucre and General [[Eloy Alfaro]].

It is the country's most fertile and productive land, and is the seat of the large [[banana]] exportation plantations of the companies [[Dole Food Company|Dole]] and [[Chiquita]]. This region is also where most of Ecuador's [[rice]] crop is grown. The truly coastal provinces have active fisheries. The largest coastal city is [[Guayaquil]].\n* '''La Sierra''', or \"the highlands\": The sierra consists of the Andean and Interandean highland provinces&nbsp;\u2013 [[Azuay Province|Azuay]], [[Ca\u00f1ar Province|Ca\u00f1ar]], [[Carchi Province|Carchi]], [[Chimborazo Province|Chimborazo]], [[Imbabura Province|Imbabura]], [[Loja Province|Loja]], [[Pichincha Province|Pichincha]], and [[Tungurahua Province|Tungurahua]].

Agriculture is focused on the traditional crops of [[potato]], [[maize]], and [[Quinoa|quinua]] and the population is predominantly Amerindian [[Quechua people|Kichua]].

This region is primarily made up of the huge Amazon national parks and Amerindian untouchable zones, which are vast stretches of land set aside for the Amazon Amerindian tribes to continue living traditionally. It is also the area with the largest reserves of [[petroleum]] in Ecuador, and parts of the upper Amazon here have been extensively exploited by petroleum companies. The population is primarily mixed Amerindian [[Shuar]], [[Huaorani]] and [[Quechua people|Kichua]], although there are numerous tribes in the deep jungle which are little-contacted. The largest city in the Oriente is probably [[Nueva Loja|Lago Agrio]] in Sucumb\u00edos, although [[Macas (city)|Macas]] in Morona Santiago runs a close second.\n* '''La Regi\u00f3n Insular''' is the region comprising the [[Gal\u00e1pagos Islands]], some {{convert|1000|km|mi}} west of the mainland in the Pacific Ocean.\n\nEcuador's capital is Quito, which is in the province of [[Pichincha Province, Ecuador|Pichincha]] in the Sierra region.

It is mild year-round in the mountain valleys, with a [[humid subtropical climate]] in coastal areas and [[rainforest]] in lowlands. The Pacific coastal area has a [[tropical climate]] with a severe rainy season. The climate in the Andean highlands is [[Temperateness|temperate]] and relatively dry, and the Amazon basin on the eastern side of the mountains shares the climate of other rainforest zones.\n\nBecause of its location at the equator, Ecuador experiences little variation in daylight hours during the course of a year. Both sunrise and sunset occur each day at the two six o'clock hours.<ref name=CIA/>\n\n===Hydrology===\n{{Main|Rivers of Ecuador}}\n[[File:Canyoning en Ba\u00f1os de Agua Santa.JPG|thumb|left|upright|[[Ba\u00f1os de Agua Santa]] is an important tourist site]]\n\nThe Andes is the ''watershed divisor'' between the [[Amazon Basin|Amazon]] watershed, which runs to the east, and the Pacific, including the north\u2013south rivers Mataje, Santiago, [[Esmeraldas River|Esmeraldas]], [[Chone River|Chone]], [[Guayas River|Guayas]], Jubones, and Puyango-Tumbes.\n\nAlmost all of the rivers in Ecuador form in the Sierra region and flow east toward the [[Amazon River]] or west toward the Pacific Ocean. The rivers rise from snowmelt at the edges of the snowcapped peaks or from the abundant precipitation that falls at higher elevations. In the Sierra region, the streams and rivers are narrow and flow rapidly over precipitous slopes. Rivers may slow and widen as they cross the hoyas yet become rapid again as they flow from the heights of the [[Andes]] to the lower elevations of the other regions. The highland rivers broaden as they enter the more level areas of the Costa and the Oriente.\n\n[[File:Driving the beach salinas ecuador.jpg|thumb|A beach of [[Salinas, Ecuador|Salinas]], [[Santa Elena Province]]]]\nIn the Costa, the external coast has mostly intermittent rivers that are fed by constant rains from December through May and become empty riverbeds during the dry season. The few exceptions are the longer, perennial rivers that flow throughout the external coast from the internal coast and La Sierra on their way to the [[Pacific Ocean]]. The internal coast, by contrast, is crossed by perennial rivers that may flood during the rainy season, sometimes forming swamps.\n\nMajor rivers in the Oriente include the [[Pastaza River|Pastaza]], [[Napo River|Napo]], and [[Putumayo River|Putumayo]]. The Pastaza is formed by the confluence of the Chambo and the Patate rivers, both of which rise in the Sierra. The Pastaza includes the Agoyan waterfall, which at {{convert|61|m|ft|abbr=off|sp=us|spell=in}} is the highest waterfall in Ecuador. The Napo rises near Mount Cotopaxi and is the major river used for transport in the eastern lowlands. The Napo ranges in width from {{convert|500|to|1800|m|ft|abbr=on}}. In its upper reaches, the Napo flows rapidly until the confluence with one of its major tributaries, the Coca River, where it slows and levels off. The Putumayo forms part of the border with Colombia. All of these rivers flow into the [[Amazon River]]. The Gal\u00e1pagos Islands have no significant rivers.

Culturally, the Toquilla straw hat and the culture of the Zapara indigenous people are recognized. The most popular sites for national and foreign tourists have different nuances due to the various tourist activities offered by the country.\n\nAmong the main tourist destinations are:\n\n*Nature attractions: [[Gal\u00e1pagos Islands]], [[Yasuni National Park]], [[El Cajas National Park]], [[Sangay National Park]], [[Podocarpus National Park]], [[Vilcabamba, Ecuador|Vilcabamba]], [[Ba\u00f1os de Agua Santa]].\n*Cultural attractions: [[Quito|Historic center of Quito]], [[Ciudad Mitad del Mundo]], [[Ingapirca]], [[Cuenca, Ecuador|Historic center of Cuenca]], [[Latacunga]] and its Mama Negra festival.\n*Snowy mountains: [[Antisana]] volcano, [[Cayambe (volcano)|Cayambe]] volcano, [[Chimborazo]] volcano, [[Cotopaxi]] volcano, [[Illiniza]]s volcanoes.\n*Beaches: [[Atacames]], [[Bah\u00eda de Car\u00e1quez]], Crucita, [[Esmeraldas, Ecuador|Esmeraldas]], [[Manta, Ecuador|Manta]], [[Monta\u00f1ita]], [[Playas, Ecuador|Playas]], [[Salinas, Ecuador|Salinas]]\n\n==Transport==\n[[File:Quito Trole 06 2011 1933.jpg|thumb|The [[Trolleybuses in Quito|Troleb\u00fas]] bus rapid transit system that runs through [[Quito]].

The major routes are Pan American (under enhancement from four to six lanes from Rumichaca to Ambato, the conclusion of 4 lanes on the entire stretch of Ambato and Riobamba and running via Riobamba to Loja). In the absence of the section between Loja and the border with Peru, there are the Route Espondilus and/or Ruta del Sol (oriented to travel along the Ecuadorian coastline) and the Amazon backbone (which crosses from north to south along the Ecuadorian Amazon, linking most and more major cities of it).\n\nAnother major project is developing the road Manta \u2013 Tena, the highway Guayaquil \u2013 Salinas Highway Aloag Santo Domingo, Riobamba \u2013 Macas (which crosses Sangay National Park). Other new developments include the National Unity bridge complex in Guayaquil, the bridge over the Napo river in Francisco de Orellana, the Esmeraldas River Bridge in the city of the same name, and, perhaps the most remarkable of all, the Bahia \u2013 San Vincente Bridge, being the largest on the Latin American Pacific coast.\n\n[[Cuenca, Ecuador|Cuenca]]'s tramway is the largest public transport system in the city and the first modern tramway in Ecuador. It was inaugurated on March 8, 2019. It has 20,4&nbsp;km and 27 stations. It will transport 120 000 passagers daily. Its route starts in the south of Cuenca and ends in the north at the Parque Industrial neighbourhood.\n\nThe [[Mariscal Sucre International Airport]] in Quito and the [[Jos\u00e9 Joaqu\u00edn de Olmedo International Airport]] in [[Guayaquil]] have experienced a high increase in demand and have required modernization.

Even though Ecuador's white population during its colonial era were mainly descendants from Spain, today Ecuador's white population is a result of a mixture of European immigrants, predominantly from Spain with people from Italy, Germany, France, and Switzerland who have settled in the early 20th century. Ecuador also has people of middle eastern extraction that have also joined the ranks of the white minority. These include economically well off immigrants of Lebanese and Palestinian descent, who are either Christian or Muslim ([[Islam in Ecuador]]).

The first and most substantial wave of modern immigration to Ecuador consisted of Spanish colonists, following the arrival of Europeans in 1499. A lower number of other Europeans and North Americans migrated to the country in the late 19th and early twentieth centuries and, in smaller numbers, Poles, Lithuanians, English, Irish, and Croats during and after the Second World War.\n\n[[File:Alicia Cahuiya, Caso Tagaeri y Taromenani.jpg|thumb|right|upright|[[Huaorani people|Huaorani]] man with the typical Amazonian indigenous clothes]]\n\nSince African slavery was not the workforce of the Spanish colonies in the Andes Mountains, given the subjugation of the Amerindian people through proselytization and ''[[encomiendas]]'', the minority population of African descent is mostly found in the coastal northern province of Esmeraldas. This is largely owing to the 17th-century shipwreck of a slave-trading galleon off the northern coast of Ecuador. The few black African survivors swam to the shore and penetrated the then-thick jungle under the leadership of Anton, the chief of the group, where they remained as free men maintaining their original culture, not influenced by the typical elements found in other provinces of the coast or in the Andean region. A little later, freed slaves from Colombia known as ''cimarrones'' joined them. In the small Chota Valley of the province of Imbabura exists a small community of Africans among the province's predominantly mestizo population. These blacks are descendants of Africans, who were brought over from Colombia by Jesuits to work their colonial sugar plantations as slaves. As a general rule, small elements of zambos and mulattoes coexisted among the overwhelming mestizo population of coastal Ecuador throughout its history as gold miners in Loja, Zaruma, and Zamora and as shipbuilders and plantation workers around the city of Guayaquil. Today you can find a small community of Africans in the Catamayo valley of the predominantly mestizo population of Loja.\n\nEcuador's Amerindian communities are integrated into the mainstream culture to varying degrees,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.south-images.com/photos-andes-ecuador.htm|title=Photos Indigenous people of Ecuador|author=Elisabeth Hurtel|publisher=South-images.com|accessdate=September 13, 2014|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://archive.today/20120911181907/http://www.south-images.com/photos-andes-ecuador.htm|archivedate=September 11, 2012|df=mdy-all}}</ref> but some may also practice their own native cultures, particularly the more remote Amerindian communities of the [[Amazon basin]]. Spanish is spoken as the first language by more than 90% of the population and as a first or second language by more than 98%. Part of Ecuador's population can speak [[Amerindian]] languages, in some cases as a second language. Two percent of the population speak only Amerindian languages.\n\n===Language===\n{{main|Languages of Ecuador }}\n{{bar box\n|title=Languages in Ecuador<ref name=\"CIAPAPUANEWGUINEA\"/>\n|titlebar=#ddd\n|left1=Language\n|right1=percent\n|float=left\n|bars=\n{{bar percent|[[Spanish language|Spanish]] ([[Castilian Spanish|Castilian]]) |Blue| 93}}\n{{bar percent|[[Quechuan languages|Kichwa]] |Orange|4.1}}\n{{bar percent|Foreign  |Green| 2.2}}\n{{bar percent|Other Indigenous |Red|0.7}}\n}}\n \nMost Ecuadorians speak Spanish as their first language, with its ubiquity permeating and dominating most of the country, though there are many who speak an Amerindian language, such as [[Kichwa]] (also spelt Quichua), which is one of the Quechuan languages and is spoken by approximately 2.5 million people in Ecuador, Bolivia, Colombia, and Peru.<ref>[[Kichwa]] Kichwa language page</ref> Other Amerindian languages spoken in Ecuador include Awapit (spoken by the Aw\u00e1), A'ingae (spoken by the Cofan), Shuar Chicham (spoken by the Shuar), Achuar-Shiwiar (spoken by the Achuar and the Shiwiar), Cha'palaachi (spoken by the Chachi), Tsa'fiki (spoken by the Ts\u00e1chila), Paicoca (spoken by the Siona and Secoya), and Wao Tededeo (spoken by the Waorani). Use of these Amerindian languages are, however, gradually diminishing due to Spanish's widespread use in education. Though most features of Ecuadorian Spanish are universal to the Spanish-speaking world, there are several idiosyncrasies.\n\n===Music===\n{{Main|Music of Ecuador}}\n[[File:Julio jaramillo laurido2.jpg|thumb|right|upright=0.9|[[Julio Jaramillo]] is an icon of the old [[Bolero]] music genre.]]\n\nThe music of Ecuador has a long history. [[Pasillo]] is a genre of indigenous Latin music. In Ecuador it is the \"national genre of music\". Through the years, many cultures have brought their influences together to create new types of music. There are also different kinds of traditional music like albazo, pasacalle, fox incaico, tonada, capishca, [[Bomba (Ecuador)|Bomba]] (highly established in Afro-Ecuadorian societies), and so on. [[Tecnocumbia]] and Rockola are clear examples of the influence of foreign cultures. One of the most traditional forms of dancing in Ecuador is [[Sanjuanito]]. It is originally from northern Ecuador ([[Otavalo (city)|Otavalo]]-Imbabura). Sanjuanito is a type of dance music played during festivities by the mestizo and Amerindian communities. According to the Ecuadorian musicologist Segundo Luis Moreno, Sanjuanito was danced by Amerindian people during San Juan Bautista's birthday. This important date was established by the Spaniards on June 24, coincidentally the same date when Amerindian people celebrated their rituals of [[Inti Raymi]].\n\n===Cuisine===\n{{see also|List of Ecuadorian dishes and foods}}\n{{multiple image\n| align = right\n| image1 = Ceviche ecuador.JPG\n| width1 = 150\n| alt1 = \n| caption1 = \n| image2 = Cuy Guinea Pig Dish SG.jpg\n| width2 = 154\n| alt2 = \n| caption2 = \n| footer = ''Ceviche ecuatoriano'' (Ecuadorian-style [[ceviche]]) and ''Cuy asado'' (grilled [[guinea pig]]) are some of the typical dishes.\n}}\n[[Ecuadorian cuisine]] is diverse, varying with the altitude and associated agricultural conditions. Most regions in Ecuador follow the traditional three-course meal of soup, a course that includes rice and a protein, and then dessert and coffee to finish. Supper is usually lighter and sometimes consists only of coffee or herbal tea with bread.{{citation needed|date=November 2014}}\n\nIn the highland region, pork, chicken, beef, and ''cuy'' (guinea pig) are popular and are served with a variety of grains (especially rice and corn) or potatoes.{{citation needed|date=November 2014}}\n\nIn the coastal region, seafood is very popular, with fish, shrimp, and ''[[ceviche]]'' being key parts of the diet. Generally, ceviches are served with fried plantain ([[chifle]]s y patacones), popcorn, or [[tostada (tortilla)|tostado]]. [[Plantain (cooking)|Plantain]]- and peanut-based dishes are the basis of most coastal meals. Encocados (dishes that contain a coconut sauce) are also very popular. ''[[Churrasco]]'' is a staple food of the coastal region, especially [[Guayaquil]]. ''Arroz con menestra y carne asada'' (rice with beans and grilled beef) is one of the traditional dishes of Guayaquil, as is [[Tostones|fried plantain]], which is often served with it. This region is a leading producer of [[banana]]s, [[cocoa bean]]s (to make chocolate), shrimp, [[tilapia]], [[mango]], and [[Passiflora edulis|passion fruit]], among other products.{{citation needed|date=November 2014}}\n\nIn the Amazon region, a dietary staple is the ''yuca'', elsewhere called [[cassava]]. Many fruits are available in this region, including [[banana]]s, [[Cyphostemma juttae|tree grapes]], and [[Bactris gasipaes|peach palm]]s.{{citation needed|date=November 2014}}\n\n===Literature===\n[[File:Jmontalvo.jpg|thumb|upright|left|[[Juan Montalvo]]]]\n\nEarly literature in colonial Ecuador, as in the rest of Spanish America, was influenced by the [[Spanish Golden Age]]. One of the earliest examples is [[Jacinto Collahuazo]],<ref name =Boceto>Borja, Piedad. [http://revistas.ucm.es/fll/02104547/articulos/ALHI7272110053A.PDF Boceto de Poes\u00eda Ecuatoriana,'Journal de la Academia de Literatura Hispanoamericana', 1972] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110503184150/http://revistas.ucm.es/fll/02104547/articulos/ALHI7272110053A.PDF |date=May 3, 2011 }}</ref> an Amerindian chief of a northern village in today's Ibarra, born in the late 1600s. Despite the early repression and discrimination of the native people by the Spanish, Collahuazo learned to read and write in [[Spanish language|Castilian]], but his work was written in [[Quechua languages|Quechua]]. The use of [[Quipu]] was banned by the Spanish,<ref>Robertson, W.S., ''History of the Latin-American Nations'', 1952</ref> and in order to preserve their work, many Inca poets had to resort to the use of the Latin alphabet to write in their native Quechua language. The history behind the Inca drama \"Ollantay\", the oldest literary piece in existence for any Amerindian language in America,<ref>Karnis, ''Surviving Pre-Columbian Drama'', The Johns Hopkins University Press, 1952</ref> shares some similarities with the work of Collahuazo. Collahuazo was imprisoned and all of his work burned. The existence of his literary work came to light many centuries later, when a crew of masons was restoring the walls of a colonial church in Quito and found a hidden manuscript. The salvaged fragment is a Spanish translation from Quechua of the \"Elegy to the Dead of Atahualpa\",<ref name =Boceto/> a poem written by Collahuazo, which describes the sadness and impotence of the Inca people of having lost their king Atahualpa.\n\nOther early Ecuadorian writers include the Jesuits [[Juan Bautista Aguirre]], born in [[Daule Canton|Daule]] in 1725, and Father [[Juan de Velasco]], born in Riobamba in 1727. De Velasco wrote about the nations and chiefdoms that had existed in the ''Kingdom of Quito'' (today Ecuador) before the arrival of the Spanish. His historical accounts are nationalistic, featuring a romantic perspective of precolonial history.\n\nFamous authors from the late colonial and early republic period include [[Eugenio Espejo]], a printer and main author of the first newspaper in Ecuadorian colonial times; [[Jose Joaquin de Olmedo]] (born in Guayaquil), famous for his ode to [[Sim\u00f3n Bol\u00edvar]] titled ''Victoria de Junin''; [[Juan Montalvo]], a prominent essayist and novelist; [[Juan Leon Mera]], famous for his work \"Cumanda\" or \"Tragedy among Savages\" and the Ecuadorian National Anthem; Juan A.

One exception is \"The Ecuadorian Deception,\" a murder mystery/thriller authored by American Bear Mills. In it, George d'Hout, a website designer from the United States is lured under false pretenses to Guayaquil. A corrupt American archaeologist is behind the plot, believing d'Hout holds the keys to locating a treasure hidden by a buccaneer ancestor. The story is based on a real pirate by the name of George d'Hout who terrorized Guayaquil in the 16th Century.\n\n===Art===\nThe best known art styles from Ecuador belonged to the ''[[Escuela Quite\u00f1a]]'' (Quito School), which developed from the 16th to 18th centuries, examples of which are on display in various old churches in Quito.

Ecuador finished in 2nd place in the [[CONMEBOL]] qualifiers behind [[Argentina national football team|Argentina]] and above the team that would become World Champions, [[Brazil national football team|Brazil]]. In the 2006 FIFA World Cup, Ecuador finished ahead of [[Poland national football team|Poland]] and [[Costa Rica national football team|Costa Rica]] finishing second behind [[Germany national football team|Germany]] in Group A in the 2006 World Cup.

These terminal degrees, as in the case of the PhD in other countries, were the main requirement for an individual to be accepted in academia as a professor or researcher. In the professional realm, a terminal degree granted by an accredited institution automatically provides a professional license to the individual.\n\nHowever, in 2004, the National Council of Higher Education (CONESUP), started the reorganization of all the degree-granting schemes of the accredited universities in order to pair them with foreign counterparts. The new structure of some careers caused the dropping of subjects, credits, or even the name of the previously conferred diplomas. The terminal degree in law, previously known as JD [[Juris Doctor]] (Doctor en Jurisprudencia) was replaced by the one of ''abogado'' (attorney) with the exception of the modification of the number of credits to equate it to an undergraduate degree. In the same fashion for medical school, the required time of education was considerably reduced from nine years (the minimum needed to obtain the title of MD in Medicine and Surgery) to almost five, with the provision that the diploma is not terminal anymore, and it is given with the title of ''m\u00e9dico'' (medic). Therefore, an MD or PhD in medicine is only to be obtained overseas until the universities adjust themselves to granting schemes and curriculum as in foreign counterparts. Nonetheless, a \"m\u00e9dico\" can start a career as family practitioner or general medicine physician.\n\n[[File:SageoEG - Biblioteca Municipal de Guayaquil 001.jpg|thumb|upright=0.9|[[Biblioteca Municipal de Guayaquil|Municipal Library of Guayaquil]]]]\n\nThis new reorganization, although very ambitious, lacked the proper path to the homologation of diplomas for highly educated professionals graduated in the country or even for the ones graduated in foreign institutions. One of the points of conflict was the imposition of obtaining foreign degrees to current academicians. As today, a master's degree is a requirement to keep an academic position and at least a foreign PhD to attain or retain the status of ''rector'' (president of a university) or ''d\u00e9cano'' (dean). For Ecuadorian researchers and many academicians trained in the country, these regulations sounded illogical, disappointing, and unlawful since it appeared a question of a title name conflict rather than specialization or science advancement.\n\nA debate to modify this and other reforms, especially the one which granted control of the Higher Education System by the government, was practically passed with consensus by the multi-partisan National Assembly on August 4, 2010, but vetoed by President [[Rafael Correa]], who wanted to keep the law strictly as it was originally redacted by his political party and SENPLADES (National Secretary of Planning and Development). Due to this change, there are many highly educated professionals and academicians under the old structure but estimated that only 87% of the faculty in public universities have already obtained a master's degree, and fewer than 5% have a PhD (although many of them already have Ecuadorian-granted doctorate degrees).\n\nAbout 300 institutes of higher education offer two to three years of post-secondary vocational or technical training.\n\n==Sciences and research==\n[[File:NEE-01-PEGASO.jpg|left|thumb|[[Ecuadorian Civilian Space Agency|EXA]]'s first satellite, [[NEE-01 Pegasus]]]]\n\nEcuador is currently placed in 96th position of innovation in technology.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20131104000235/http://elcomercio.com/sociedad/Tecnologia-innovacion-emprendimiento-emprendedores-Ecuador-desarrollo-nuevasTecnologias_0_995900422.html Ecuador ocupa el puesto 96 en innovaci\u00f3n tecnol\u00f3gica]. elcomercio.com.

Many missionaries maintain health and [[leprosy]] centers. The [[Government of Cameroon|government]] is pursuing a vigorous policy of public health improvement, with considerable success in reducing [[African trypanosomiasis|sleeping sickness]], [[leprosy]], and other endemic diseases.<ref name=\"Rose Futrih N.

The need for modern equipment is especially urgent, with many clinics using outdated equipment, some of which is imported illegally from [[Nigeria]]. There is also a shortage in professional medical staff, partially caused by public service hiring quotas. Therefore the staff that works is badly paid and has too much work to do, which makes it difficult to treat patients adequately. Many doctors and nurses which were trained in Cameroon emigrate to Europe \u2013 but also to South Africa and Asia \u2013 for that reason.<ref name=\"Rose Futrih N.
