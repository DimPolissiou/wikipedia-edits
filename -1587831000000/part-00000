According to Lawson, minimalism was the result, even though the term \"minimalism\" was not generally embraced by the artists associated with it, and many practitioners of art designated minimalist by critics did not identify it as a movement as such. Also taking exception to this claim was Clement Greenberg himself; in his 1978 postscript to his essay ''Modernist Painting'' he disavowed this interpretation of what he said, writing:\n\n<blockquote>There have been some further constructions of what I wrote that go over into preposterousness: That {{\u2060sic}} I regard flatness and the inclosing of flatness not just as the limiting conditions of pictorial art, but as criteria of aesthetic quality in pictorial art; that the further a work advances the self-definition of an art, the better that work is bound to be. The philosopher or art historian who can envision me\u2014or anyone at all\u2014arriving at aesthetic judgments in this way reads shockingly more into himself or herself than into my article.<ref name=\"sharecom\"/></blockquote>\n\nIn contrast to the previous decade's more subjective [[Abstract expressionism|Abstract Expressionists]], with the exceptions of [[Barnett Newman]] and [[Ad Reinhardt]]; minimalists were also influenced by composers [[John Cage]] and [[La Monte Young|LaMonte Young]], poet [[William Carlos Williams]], and the landscape architect [[Frederick Law Olmsted]]. They very explicitly stated that their art was not about self-expression, and unlike the previous decade's more subjective philosophy about art making theirs was 'objective'. In general, minimalism's features included [[Geometry|geometric]], often [[Cube|cubic]] forms purged of much [[metaphor]], equality of parts, [[wikt:repetition|repetition]], neutral surfaces, and industrial materials.\n\n[[Robert Morris (artist)|Robert Morris]], a theorist and artist, wrote a three part essay, \"Notes on Sculpture 1\u20133\", originally published across three issues of ''Artforum'' in 1966. In these essays, Morris attempted to define a conceptual framework and formal elements for himself and one that would embrace the practices of his contemporaries. These essays paid great attention to the idea of the [[wikt:Gestalt|gestalt]] \u2013 \"parts... bound together in such a way that they create a maximum resistance to perceptual separation.\" Morris later described an art represented by a \"marked lateral spread and no regularized units or symmetrical intervals...\" in \"Notes on Sculpture 4: Beyond Objects\", originally published in ''Artforum'', 1969, continuing on to say that \"indeterminacy of arrangement of parts is a literal aspect of the physical existence of the thing.\" The general shift in theory of which this essay is an expression suggests the transition into what would later be referred to as ''[[postminimalism]]''.\n\nOne of the first artists specifically associated with minimalism was the painter [[Frank Stella]], four of whose early \"black paintings\" were included in the 1959 show, ''[[Dorothy Miller#1959: Sixteen Americans|16 Americans]],'' organized by [[Dorothy Miller]] at the [[Museum of Modern Art]] in New York. The width of the stripes in Frank Stellas's black paintings were often determined by the dimensions of the lumber he used for stretchers to support the canvas, visible against the canvas as the depth of the painting when viewed from the side. Stella's decisions about structures on the front surface of the canvas were therefore not entirely subjective, but pre-conditioned by a \"given\" feature of the physical construction of the support. In the show catalog, [[Carl Andre]] noted, \"Art excludes the unnecessary. Frank Stella has found it necessary to paint [[wikt:stripe|stripes]]. There is nothing else in his painting.\" These reductive works were in sharp contrast to the energy-filled and apparently highly subjective and emotionally charged paintings of [[Willem de Kooning]] or [[Franz Kline]] and, in terms of precedent among the previous generation of abstract expressionists, leaned more toward the less gestural, often somber, [[color field]] paintings of [[Barnett Newman]] and [[Mark Rothko]]. Stella received immediate attention from the MoMA show, but other artists\u2014including [[Kenneth Noland]], [[Gene Davis (painter)|Gene Davis]], [[Robert Motherwell]], and [[Robert Ryman]]\u2014had also begun to explore stripes, [[Monochrome|monochromatic]] and [[Hard-edge painting|Hard-edge]] formats from the late 50s through the 1960s.<ref>{{cite encyclopedia|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/384056/minimalism |title=Britannica.com |encyclopedia=Britannica.com |accessdate=2014-06-27}}</ref>\n\nBecause of a tendency in minimal art to exclude the pictorial, illusionistic and fictive in favor of the literal, there was a movement away from painterly and toward sculptural concerns. [[Donald Judd]] had started as a painter, and ended as a creator of objects. His seminal essay, \"Specific Objects\" (published in Arts Yearbook 8, 1965), was a touchstone of theory for the formation of minimalist aesthetics. In this essay, Judd found a starting point for a new territory for American art, and a simultaneous rejection of residual inherited European artistic values. He pointed to evidence of this development in the works of an array of artists active in New York at the time, including [[Jasper Johns]], Dan Flavin and [[Lee Bontecou]]. Of \"preliminary\" importance for Judd was the work of [[George Earl Ortman]],<ref>{{cite web|last=Oisteanu |first=Valery |url=http://brooklynrail.org/2006/12/artseen/ortman |title=Brooklynrail.org |publisher=Brooklynrail.org |date=2006-12-08 |accessdate=2014-06-27}}</ref> who had concretized and distilled painting's forms into blunt, tough, philosophically charged geometries. These Specific Objects inhabited a space not then comfortably classifiable as either painting or sculpture. That the categorical identity of such objects was itself in question, and that they avoided easy association with well-worn and over-familiar conventions, was a part of their value for Judd.\n\nThis movement was criticized by modernist formalist art critics and historians. Some critics thought minimal art represented a misunderstanding of the modern dialectic of painting and sculpture as defined by critic [[Clement Greenberg]], arguably the dominant American critic of painting in the period leading up to the 1960s. The most notable critique of minimalism was produced by [[Michael Fried]], a formalist critic, who objected to the work on the basis of its \"theatricality\". In ''Art and Objecthood'' (published in Artforum in June 1967) he declared that the minimal work of art, particularly minimal sculpture, was based on an engagement with the physicality of the spectator. He argued that work like Robert Morris's transformed the act of viewing into a type of [[spectacle]], in which the artifice of the act [[observation]] and the viewer's [[participant Media|participation]] in the work were unveiled. Fried saw this displacement of the viewer's experience from an aesthetic engagement within, to an event outside of the artwork as a failure of minimal art. Fried's essay was immediately challenged by [[postminimalist]] and [[Land art|earth artist]] [[Robert Smithson]] in a letter to the editor in the October issue of Artforum. Smithson stated the following: \"What Fried fears most is the [[consciousness]] of what he is doing\u2014namely being himself theatrical.\"\n\nIn addition to the already mentioned [[Robert Morris (artist)|Robert Morris]], [[Frank Stella]], [[Carl Andre]], [[Robert Ryman]] and [[Donald Judd]] other minimal artists include: [[Robert Mangold]], [[Larry Bell (artist)|Larry Bell]], [[Dan Flavin]], [[Sol LeWitt]], [[Charles Hinman]], [[Ronald Bladen]], [[Paul Mogensen]], [[Ronald Davis]], [[David Novros]], [[Brice Marden]], [[Blinky Palermo]], [[Agnes Martin]], [[Jo Baer]], [[John McCracken (artist)|John McCracken]], [[Ad Reinhardt]], [[Fred Sandback]], [[Richard Serra]], [[Tony Smith (sculptor)|Tony Smith]], [[Patricia Johanson]], and [[Anne Truitt]].\n\n[[Ad Reinhardt]], actually an artist of the [[Abstract expressionism|Abstract Expressionist]] generation, but one whose [[reductionism|reductive]] nearly all-black paintings seemed to anticipate minimalism, had this to say about the value of a reductive approach to art:\n\n''The more stuff in it, the busier the work of art, the worse it is. More is less. Less is more. The eye is a menace to clear sight. The laying bare of oneself is obscene. Art begins with the getting rid of nature.''<ref>in Barbara Rose, ed.

It removes all the unnecessary internal walls and opens up the space. The emptiness of spatial arrangement reduces everything down to the most essential quality.<ref>Bertoni 2002, p.&nbsp;23.</ref>\n\nThe Japanese aesthetic of [[Wabi-sabi]] values the quality of simple and plain objects.<ref>Saito, (Winter 2007), The Moral Dimension of Japanese Aesthetics, The Journal of Aesthetics and Art Criticism, vol.65, no. 1. p85.</ref> It appreciates the absence of unnecessary features, treasures a life in quietness and aims to reveal the innate character of materials.<ref>Pawson (1996), Minimum, London: Phaidon Press Limited. p10\u201311.</ref> For example, the Japanese floral art, also known as [[Ikebana]], has the central principle of letting the flower express itself.

His design concepts are materials, pure geometry and nature. He normally uses concrete or natural wood and basic structural form to achieve austerity and rays of light in space. He also sets up dialogue between the site and nature to create relationship and order with the buildings.<ref>Bertoni 2002, pp.&nbsp;96\u2013106.</ref> Ando's works and the translation of Japanese aesthetic principles are highly influential on Japanese architecture.<ref>Cerver 1997, p.&nbsp;13.</ref>\n\nAnother Japanese minimalist architect, [[Kazuyo Sejima]], works on her own and in conjunction with [[Ryue Nishizawa]], as [[SANAA]], producing iconic Japanese Minimalist buildings. Credited with creating and influencing a particular genre of Japanese Minimalism,<ref>Puglisi, L.P. (2008), New Directions in Contermporary Architecture, Chichester, John Wiley and Sons.</ref> Sejimas delicate, intelligent designs may use white color, thin construction sections and transparent elements to create the phenomenal building type often associated with minimalism. Works include [[New Museum]](2010) New York City, Small House (2000) Tokyo, House surrounded By Plum Trees (2003) Tokyo.\n\nIn Vitra Conference Pavilion, Weil am Rhein, 1993, the concepts are to bring together the relationships between building, human movement, site and nature. Which as one main point of minimalism ideology that establish dialogue between the building and site. The building uses the simple forms of circle and rectangle to contrast the filled and void space of the interior and nature. In the foyer, there is a large landscape window that looks out to the exterior. This achieves the simple and silence of architecture and enhances the light, wind, time and nature in space.<ref>Cerver 1997, pp.&nbsp;18\u201329.</ref>\n\n[[John Pawson]] is a British minimalist architect; his design concepts are soul, light, and order. He believes that though reduced clutter and simplification of the interior to a point that gets beyond the idea of essential quality, there is a sense of clarity and richness of simplicity instead of emptiness. The materials in his design reveal the perception toward space, surface, and volume. Moreover, he likes to use natural materials because of their aliveness, sense of depth and quality of an individual. He is also attracted by the important influences from Japanese Zen Philosophy.<ref>Pawson (1996), Minimum, London: Phaidon Press Limited. p10-14.</ref>\n\nCalvin Klein Madison Avenue, New York, 1995\u201396, is a boutique that conveys Calvin Klein's ideas of fashion. John Pawson's interior design concepts for this project are to create simple, peaceful and orderly spatial arrangements. He used stone floors and white walls to achieve simplicity and harmony for space. He also emphasises reduction and eliminates the visual distortions, such as the air conditioning and lamps to achieve a sense of purity for interior.<ref>Cerver 1997, pp.&nbsp;170\u201377.</ref>\n\n[[Alberto Campo Baeza]] is a Spanish architect and describes his work as essential architecture. He values the concepts of light, idea and space. Light is essential and achieves the relationship between inhabitants and the building. Ideas are to meet the function and context of space, forms, and construction. Space is shaped by the minimal geometric forms to avoid decoration that is not essential.<ref>Bertoni 2002, p.&nbsp;182.</ref>\n\nGasper House, Zahora, 1992 is a residence that the client wanted to be independent. High walls create the enclosed space and the stone floors used in house and courtyard show the continuality of interior and exterior. The white colour of the walls reveals the simplicity and unity of the building. The feature of the structure make lines to form the continuously horizontal house, therefore natural light projects horizontally through the building.<ref>Bertoni 2002, p.&nbsp;192.</ref>\n\n== Literary minimalism ==\n{{see also|Concision}}\nLiterary minimalism is characterized by an economy with words and a focus on surface description. Minimalist writers eschew adverbs and prefer allowing context to dictate meaning. Readers are expected to take an active role in creating the story, to \"choose sides\" based on oblique hints and innuendo, rather than react to directions from the writer.\n\nSome 1940s-era crime fiction of writers such as [[James M. Cain]] and [[Jim Thompson (writer)|Jim Thompson]] adopted a stripped-down, matter-of-fact prose style to considerable effect; some classify this prose style as minimalism.{{Weasel inline|date=November 2011}}\n\nAnother strand of literary minimalism arose in response to the [[metafiction]] trend of the 1960s and early 1970s ([[John Barth]], [[Robert Coover]], and [[William H. Gass]]). These writers were also sparse with prose and kept a psychological distance from their subject matter.{{Citation needed|date=November 2011}}\n\nMinimalist writers, or those who are identified with minimalism during certain periods of their writing careers, include the following: [[Raymond Carver]], [[Ann Beattie]], [[Bret Easton Ellis]], [[Charles Bukowski]], [[Ernest Hemingway]], [[K.

The term \"minimalism\" is also sometimes associated with the briefest of poetic genres, [[haiku]], which originated in Japan, but has been domesticated in English literature by poets such as [[Nick Virgilio]], [[Raymond Roseliep]], and [[George Swede]].{{Citation needed|date=November 2011}}\n\nThe Irish writer [[Samuel Beckett]] is well known for his minimalist plays and prose, as is the Norwegian writer [[Jon Fosse]].<ref>{{cite web|last1=Davies|first1=Paul|title=Samuel Beckett|url=http://www.litencyc.com/php/speople.php?rec=true&UID=5161|website=Literary Encyclopedia|accessdate=2 December 2016}}</ref>\n\n[[Dimitris Lyacos]]'s ''[[With the People from the Bridge]]'', combining elliptical monologues with a pared-down prose narrative is a contemporary example of minimalist playwrighting.<ref>https://www.tikkun.org/from-the-ruins-of-europe-lyacoss-debt-riddled-greece</ref><ref>http://www.commonlinejournal.com/2015/12/review-of-dimitris-lyacoss-with-people.html</ref>\n\nIn his novel ''The Easy Chain'', [[Evan Dara]] includes a 60-page section written in the style of musical minimalism, in particular inspired by composer [[Steve Reich]].

Their films typically tell a simple story with straight forward camera usage and minimal use of score. [[Paul Schrader]] named their kind of cinema: \"transcendental cinema\".<ref>Paul Schrader on Revisiting Transcendental Style in Film | TIFF 2017|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4F8I8OVmUU</ref> [[Abbas Kiarostami]] and [[Elia Suleiman]] are also considered creators of minimalistic films.{{Citation needed|date=January 2020}}\n[[File:Landfill face.JPG|thumb|Landfill]]\n[[The Minimalists|Joshua Fields Millburn]] and [[The Minimalists|Ryan Nicodemus]] directed and produced a movie called ''Minimalism:[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Co1Iptd4p4] A Documentary.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.theminimalists.com/films/|title=Films by The Minimalists|website=The Minimalists|language=en-US|access-date=2019-04-09}}</ref>'' that showcased the idea of minimal living in the modern world.

According to Lawson, minimalism was the result, even though the term \"minimalism\" was not generally embraced by the artists associated with it, and many practitioners of art designated minimalist by critics did not identify it as a movement as such. Also taking exception to this claim was Clement Greenberg himself; in his 1978 postscript to his essay ''Modernist Painting'' he disavowed this interpretation of what he said, writing:\n\n<blockquote>There have been some further constructions of what I wrote that go over into preposterousness: That {{\u2060sic}} I regard flatness and the inclosing of flatness not just as the limiting conditions of pictorial art, but as criteria of aesthetic quality in pictorial art; that the further a work advances the self-definition of an art, the better that work is bound to be. The philosopher or art historian who can envision me\u2014or anyone at all\u2014arriving at aesthetic judgments in this way reads shockingly more into himself or herself than into my article.<ref name=\"sharecom\"/></blockquote>\n\nIn contrast to the previous decade's more subjective [[Abstract expressionism|Abstract Expressionists]], with the exceptions of [[Barnett Newman]] and [[Ad Reinhardt]]; minimalists were also influenced by composers [[John Cage]] and [[La Monte Young|LaMonte Young]], poet [[William Carlos Williams]], and the landscape architect [[Frederick Law Olmsted]]. They very explicitly stated that their art was not about self-expression, and unlike the previous decade's more subjective philosophy about art making theirs was 'objective'. In general, minimalism's features included [[Geometry|geometric]], often [[Cube|cubic]] forms purged of much [[metaphor]], equality of parts, [[wikt:repetition|repetition]], neutral surfaces, and industrial materials.\n\n[[Robert Morris (artist)|Robert Morris]], a theorist and artist, wrote a three part essay, \"Notes on Sculpture 1\u20133\", originally published across three issues of ''Artforum'' in 1966. In these essays, Morris attempted to define a conceptual framework and formal elements for himself and one that would embrace the practices of his contemporaries. These essays paid great attention to the idea of the [[wikt:Gestalt|gestalt]] \u2013 \"parts... bound together in such a way that they create a maximum resistance to perceptual separation.\" Morris later described an art represented by a \"marked lateral spread and no regularized units or symmetrical intervals...\" in \"Notes on Sculpture 4: Beyond Objects\", originally published in ''Artforum'', 1969, continuing on to say that \"indeterminacy of arrangement of parts is a literal aspect of the physical existence of the thing.\" The general shift in theory of which this essay is an expression suggests the transition into what would later be referred to as ''[[postminimalism]]''.\n\nOne of the first artists specifically associated with minimalism was the painter [[Frank Stella]], four of whose early \"black paintings\" were included in the 1959 show, ''[[Dorothy Miller#1959: Sixteen Americans|16 Americans]],'' organized by [[Dorothy Miller]] at the [[Museum of Modern Art]] in New York. The width of the stripes in Frank Stellas's black paintings were often determined by the dimensions of the lumber he used for stretchers to support the canvas, visible against the canvas as the depth of the painting when viewed from the side. Stella's decisions about structures on the front surface of the canvas were therefore not entirely subjective, but pre-conditioned by a \"given\" feature of the physical construction of the support. In the show catalog, [[Carl Andre]] noted, \"Art excludes the unnecessary. Frank Stella has found it necessary to paint [[wikt:stripe|stripes]]. There is nothing else in his painting.\" These reductive works were in sharp contrast to the energy-filled and apparently highly subjective and emotionally charged paintings of [[Willem de Kooning]] or [[Franz Kline]] and, in terms of precedent among the previous generation of abstract expressionists, leaned more toward the less gestural, often somber, [[color field]] paintings of [[Barnett Newman]] and [[Mark Rothko]]. Stella received immediate attention from the MoMA show, but other artists\u2014including [[Kenneth Noland]], [[Gene Davis (painter)|Gene Davis]], [[Robert Motherwell]], and [[Robert Ryman]]\u2014had also begun to explore stripes, [[Monochrome|monochromatic]] and [[Hard-edge painting|Hard-edge]] formats from the late 50s through the 1960s.<ref>{{cite encyclopedia|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/384056/minimalism |title=Britannica.com |encyclopedia=Britannica.com |accessdate=2014-06-27}}</ref>\n\nBecause of a tendency in minimal art to exclude the pictorial, illusionistic and fictive in favor of the literal, there was a movement away from painterly and toward sculptural concerns. [[Donald Judd]] had started as a painter, and ended as a creator of objects. His seminal essay, \"Specific Objects\" (published in Arts Yearbook 8, 1965), was a touchstone of theory for the formation of minimalist aesthetics. In this essay, Judd found a starting point for a new territory for American art, and a simultaneous rejection of residual inherited European artistic values. He pointed to evidence of this development in the works of an array of artists active in New York at the time, including [[Jasper Johns]], Dan Flavin and [[Lee Bontecou]]. Of \"preliminary\" importance for Judd was the work of [[George Earl Ortman]],<ref>{{cite web|last=Oisteanu |first=Valery |url=http://brooklynrail.org/2006/12/artseen/ortman |title=Brooklynrail.org |publisher=Brooklynrail.org |date=2006-12-08 |accessdate=2014-06-27}}</ref> who had concretized and distilled painting's forms into blunt, tough, philosophically charged geometries. These Specific Objects inhabited a space not then comfortably classifiable as either painting or sculpture. That the categorical identity of such objects was itself in question, and that they avoided easy association with well-worn and over-familiar conventions, was a part of their value for Judd.\n\nThis movement was criticized by modernist formalist art critics and historians. Some critics thought minimal art represented a misunderstanding of the modern dialectic of painting and sculpture as defined by critic [[Clement Greenberg]], arguably the dominant American critic of painting in the period leading up to the 1960s. The most notable critique of minimalism was produced by [[Michael Fried]], a formalist critic, who objected to the work on the basis of its \"theatricality\". In ''Art and Objecthood'' (published in Artforum in June 1967) he declared that the minimal work of art, particularly minimal sculpture, was based on an engagement with the physicality of the spectator. He argued that work like Robert Morris's transformed the act of viewing into a type of [[spectacle]], in which the artifice of the act [[observation]] and the viewer's [[participant Media|participation]] in the work were unveiled. Fried saw this displacement of the viewer's experience from an aesthetic engagement within, to an event outside of the artwork as a failure of minimal art. Fried's essay was immediately challenged by [[postminimalist]] and [[Land art|earth artist]] [[Robert Smithson]] in a letter to the editor in the October issue of Artforum. Smithson stated the following: \"What Fried fears most is the [[consciousness]] of what he is doing\u2014namely being himself theatrical.\"\n\nIn addition to the already mentioned [[Robert Morris (artist)|Robert Morris]], [[Frank Stella]], [[Carl Andre]], [[Robert Ryman]] and [[Donald Judd]] other minimal artists include: [[Robert Mangold]], [[Larry Bell (artist)|Larry Bell]], [[Dan Flavin]], [[Sol LeWitt]], [[Charles Hinman]], [[Ronald Bladen]], [[Paul Mogensen]], [[Ronald Davis]], [[David Novros]], [[Brice Marden]], [[Blinky Palermo]], [[Agnes Martin]], [[Jo Baer]], [[John McCracken (artist)|John McCracken]], [[Ad Reinhardt]], [[Fred Sandback]], [[Richard Serra]], [[Tony Smith (sculptor)|Tony Smith]], [[Patricia Johanson]], and [[Anne Truitt]].\n\n[[Ad Reinhardt]], actually an artist of the [[Abstract expressionism|Abstract Expressionist]] generation, but one whose [[reductionism|reductive]] nearly all-black paintings seemed to anticipate minimalism, had this to say about the value of a reductive approach to art:\n\n''The more stuff in it, the busier the work of art, the worse it is. More is less. Less is more. The eye is a menace to clear sight. The laying bare of oneself is obscene. Art begins with the getting rid of nature.''<ref>in Barbara Rose, ed.

It removes all the unnecessary internal walls and opens up the space. The emptiness of spatial arrangement reduces everything down to the most essential quality.<ref>Bertoni 2002, p.&nbsp;23.</ref>\n\nThe Japanese aesthetic of [[Wabi-sabi]] values the quality of simple and plain objects.<ref>Saito, (Winter 2007), The Moral Dimension of Japanese Aesthetics, The Journal of Aesthetics and Art Criticism, vol.65, no. 1. p85.</ref> It appreciates the absence of unnecessary features, treasures a life in quietness and aims to reveal the innate character of materials.<ref>Pawson (1996), Minimum, London: Phaidon Press Limited. p10\u201311.</ref> For example, the Japanese floral art, also known as [[Ikebana]], has the central principle of letting the flower express itself.

His design concepts are materials, pure geometry and nature. He normally uses concrete or natural wood and basic structural form to achieve austerity and rays of light in space. He also sets up dialogue between the site and nature to create relationship and order with the buildings.<ref>Bertoni 2002, pp.&nbsp;96\u2013106.</ref> Ando's works and the translation of Japanese aesthetic principles are highly influential on Japanese architecture.<ref>Cerver 1997, p.&nbsp;13.</ref>\n\nAnother Japanese minimalist architect, [[Kazuyo Sejima]], works on her own and in conjunction with [[Ryue Nishizawa]], as [[SANAA]], producing iconic Japanese Minimalist buildings. Credited with creating and influencing a particular genre of Japanese Minimalism,<ref>Puglisi, L.P. (2008), New Directions in Contermporary Architecture, Chichester, John Wiley and Sons.</ref> Sejimas delicate, intelligent designs may use white color, thin construction sections and transparent elements to create the phenomenal building type often associated with minimalism. Works include [[New Museum]](2010) New York City, Small House (2000) Tokyo, House surrounded By Plum Trees (2003) Tokyo.\n\nIn Vitra Conference Pavilion, Weil am Rhein, 1993, the concepts are to bring together the relationships between building, human movement, site and nature. Which as one main point of minimalism ideology that establish dialogue between the building and site. The building uses the simple forms of circle and rectangle to contrast the filled and void space of the interior and nature. In the foyer, there is a large landscape window that looks out to the exterior. This achieves the simple and silence of architecture and enhances the light, wind, time and nature in space.<ref>Cerver 1997, pp.&nbsp;18\u201329.</ref>\n\n[[John Pawson]] is a British minimalist architect; his design concepts are soul, light, and order. He believes that though reduced clutter and simplification of the interior to a point that gets beyond the idea of essential quality, there is a sense of clarity and richness of simplicity instead of emptiness. The materials in his design reveal the perception toward space, surface, and volume. Moreover, he likes to use natural materials because of their aliveness, sense of depth and quality of an individual. He is also attracted by the important influences from Japanese Zen Philosophy.<ref>Pawson (1996), Minimum, London: Phaidon Press Limited. p10-14.</ref>\n\nCalvin Klein Madison Avenue, New York, 1995\u201396, is a boutique that conveys Calvin Klein's ideas of fashion. John Pawson's interior design concepts for this project are to create simple, peaceful and orderly spatial arrangements. He used stone floors and white walls to achieve simplicity and harmony for space. He also emphasises reduction and eliminates the visual distortions, such as the air conditioning and lamps to achieve a sense of purity for interior.<ref>Cerver 1997, pp.&nbsp;170\u201377.</ref>\n\n[[Alberto Campo Baeza]] is a Spanish architect and describes his work as essential architecture. He values the concepts of light, idea and space. Light is essential and achieves the relationship between inhabitants and the building. Ideas are to meet the function and context of space, forms, and construction. Space is shaped by the minimal geometric forms to avoid decoration that is not essential.<ref>Bertoni 2002, p.&nbsp;182.</ref>\n\nGasper House, Zahora, 1992 is a residence that the client wanted to be independent. High walls create the enclosed space and the stone floors used in house and courtyard show the continuality of interior and exterior. The white colour of the walls reveals the simplicity and unity of the building. The feature of the structure make lines to form the continuously horizontal house, therefore natural light projects horizontally through the building.<ref>Bertoni 2002, p.&nbsp;192.</ref>\n\n== Literary minimalism ==\n{{see also|Concision}}\nLiterary minimalism is characterized by an economy with words and a focus on surface description. Minimalist writers eschew adverbs and prefer allowing context to dictate meaning. Readers are expected to take an active role in creating the story, to \"choose sides\" based on oblique hints and innuendo, rather than react to directions from the writer.\n\nSome 1940s-era crime fiction of writers such as [[James M. Cain]] and [[Jim Thompson (writer)|Jim Thompson]] adopted a stripped-down, matter-of-fact prose style to considerable effect; some classify this prose style as minimalism.{{Weasel inline|date=November 2011}}\n\nAnother strand of literary minimalism arose in response to the [[metafiction]] trend of the 1960s and early 1970s ([[John Barth]], [[Robert Coover]], and [[William H. Gass]]). These writers were also sparse with prose and kept a psychological distance from their subject matter.{{Citation needed|date=November 2011}}\n\nMinimalist writers, or those who are identified with minimalism during certain periods of their writing careers, include the following: [[Raymond Carver]], [[Ann Beattie]], [[Bret Easton Ellis]], [[Charles Bukowski]], [[Ernest Hemingway]], [[K. J. Stevens]], [[Amy Hempel]], [[Bobbie Ann Mason]], [[Tobias Wolff]], [[Grace Paley]], [[Sandra Cisneros]], [[Mary Robison]], [[Frederick Barthelme]], [[Richard Ford]], [[Patrick Holland (author)|Patrick Holland]], [[Cormac McCarthy]], and [[Alicia Erian]].{{Citation needed|date=November 2011}}\n\nAmerican poets such as [[Stephen Crane]], [[William Carlos Williams]], early [[Ezra Pound]], [[Robert Creeley]], [[Robert Grenier (poet)|Robert Grenier]], and [[Aram Saroyan]] are sometimes identified with their ''minimalist'' style. The term \"minimalism\" is also sometimes associated with the briefest of poetic genres, [[haiku]], which originated in Japan, but has been domesticated in English literature by poets such as [[Nick Virgilio]], [[Raymond Roseliep]], and [[George Swede]].{{Citation needed|date=November 2011}}\n\nThe Irish writer [[Samuel Beckett]] is well known for his minimalist plays and prose, as is the Norwegian writer [[Jon Fosse]].<ref>{{cite web|last1=Davies|first1=Paul|title=Samuel Beckett|url=http://www.litencyc.com/php/speople.php?rec=true&UID=5161|website=Literary Encyclopedia|accessdate=2 December 2016}}</ref>\n\n[[Dimitris Lyacos]]'s ''[[With the People from the Bridge]]'', combining elliptical monologues with a pared-down prose narrative is a contemporary example of minimalist playwrighting.<ref>https://www.tikkun.org/from-the-ruins-of-europe-lyacoss-debt-riddled-greece</ref><ref>http://www.commonlinejournal.com/2015/12/review-of-dimitris-lyacoss-with-people.html</ref>\n\nIn his novel ''The Easy Chain'', [[Evan Dara]] includes a 60-page section written in the style of musical minimalism, in particular inspired by composer [[Steve Reich]]. Intending to represent the psychological state (agitation) of the novel's main character, the section's successive lines of text are built on repetitive and developing phrases.{{Citation needed|date=November 2011}}\n\n==Minimal music==\n{{main|Minimal music}}\n\nThe term \"minimal music\" was derived around 1970 by [[Michael Nyman]] from the concept of minimalism, which was earlier applied to the [[visual arts]].<ref name=Bernard93>{{cite journal|last=Bernard|first=Jonathan W.|title=The Minimalist Aesthetic in the Plastic Arts and in Music|journal=Perspectives of New Music|date=1993|volume=31|issue= 1 (Winter)|page=87|jstor=833043}}, citing Dan Warburton as his authority.</ref><ref name=Warburton88>{{cite web|last=Warburton|first=Dan|title=A Working Terminology for Minimal Music|url=http://www.paristransatlantic.com/magazine/archives/minimalism.html|accessdate=11 January 2014}}</ref> More precisely, it was in a 1968 review in ''The Spectator'' that Nyman first used the term, to describe a ten-minute piano composition by the Danish composer [[Henning Christiansen]], along with several other unnamed pieces played by [[Charlotte Moorman]] and [[Nam June Paik]] at the [[Institute of Contemporary Arts]] in London.<ref>Nyman 1968, 519.</ref>\n\n==Minimalism in film==\nThe term usually is associated with filmmakers such as [[Robert Bresson]], [[Carl Theodor Dreyer]], and [[Yasujir\u014d Ozu]].

As for their foundation, I said, here is none, and we must run two beams the whole length upon the crown of the vaulting, like the keels of two ships, joint the separate pieces together upon the supporting sub-walls, mortice them into the end walls, and then step the wooden pillars upon them. Having raised these pillars, cased them and expanded the tops into capitals at the height of the walls, we next raised wooden semi-circular arches above them, so as to receive an open roof.

He was the [[architect]] later employed on the nearby [[Clifton College]] in the 1860s,<ref name=\":0\" /> and was brother to [[Joseph Hansom]] the \u2018[[Hansom cab|cab]] maker\u2019.<ref name=\":1\" /> Charles had a house at Arlington Villas in Wetherell Place just around the corner from where Bishop Ullathorne lived at 22 Meridian Place.<ref name=\":1\" /> Bishop Ullathorne continues:<blockquote>[[File:Procathedral wooden roof.png|alt=The wooden 'temporary' roof structure added to the ProCathedral by Charles Hansom|thumb|The wooden 'temporary' roof structure added to the ProCathedral by Charles Hansom|133x133px]]'I sent for Mr. Hansom; told him he must put his architectural reputation into his pocket, and simply follow my directions\u2026 I directed him to raise the walls round to a level for about two feet above their actual height, and then to put in two rows of columns, not of stone, for they would have to come on the crown of the crypt vaultings, but of wood, to be made stouter to the eye by casings. As for their foundation, I said, here is none, and we must run two beams the whole length upon the crown of the vaulting, like the keels of two ships, joint the separate pieces together upon the supporting sub-walls, mortice them into the end walls, and then step the wooden pillars upon them. Having raised these pillars, cased them and expanded the tops into capitals at the height of the walls, we next raised wooden semi-circular arches above them, so as to receive an open roof. This will give us the requisite height and enable the building to carry a roof. We thus succeeded at a small cost in converting the ruin into the present cathedral of Clifton.'<ref name=\":2\" /></blockquote>This 'ingenious, comparatively lightly aisled structure of timber uprights and arches supported a timber roof',<ref name=\":0\" /> was compared to an upturned boat,<ref name=\":3\" /> familiar to Ullathorne from his naval childhood.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nThe church was opened by [[William Bernard Ullathorne|Bishop Ullathorne]] on 21<sup>st</sup> September 1848. In 1850, [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Clifton|Clifton]] was made an [[episcopal see]] and the church became the [[Pro-Cathedral]], intended to act in this capacity until a more fitting cathedral church could be constructed. [[Joseph William Hendren|Bishop Joseph Hendren]] became the first [[Bishop of Clifton]] (the [[Ceremonial counties of England|ceremonial counties]] of [[Gloucestershire]], [[Wiltshire]] and [[Somerset]] and [[Bristol]]), and Ullathorne was made Bishop of Birmingham, and later [[Archbishop of Birmingham]].<ref name=\":1\" />\n[[File:Vaughan postcard procathedral interior.png|alt=Postcard, ProCathedral interior, undated (probably early 20th cent.)|left|thumb|Postcard, ProCathedral interior, undated (probably early 20th cent.), from the Roy Vaughan Collections, BRO43207/29/19/10, Bristol Archives]]\n[[File:Vaughan postcard procathedral exterior 1912.png|alt=Postcard, ProCathedral, 9 Feb 1912|thumb|Postcard, ProCathedral, 9 Feb 1912, Roy Vaughan Collection,\u00a0 BRO43207/29/19/9, Bristol Archives]]\nIn the ProCathedral Church there were twelve larger-than-life statues of the [[Apostles]] standing atop the [[Pedestal|plinths]] covering and disguising the original stone columns of the failed building.<ref name=\":1\" /> In addition, there were two or three statues of the [[Mary, mother of Jesus|Virgin Mary]], a statue of the [[Sacred Heart]], and a multiplicity of other statues of other saints including [[John the Baptist|St John the Baptist]], [[Th\u00e9r\u00e8se of Lisieux|St Therese of Lisieux]], [[Anthony of Padua|St Anthony of Padua]] and [[Saint Roch|St Rock]].

In the 1980s, home cinemas typically consisted of a movie pre-recorded on a LaserDisc or VHS tape; a  [[LaserDisc]] or [[VHS]] player; and a heavy, bulky large-screen [[cathode ray tube]] TV set, although sometimes [[CRT projector]]s were used instead. In the 2000s, technological innovations in sound systems, video player equipment and TV screens and [[video projector]]s have changed the equipment used in home cinema set-ups and enabled home users to experience a higher-resolution screen image, improved sound quality and components that offer users more options (e.g., many of the more expensive [[Blu-ray]] players in 2016 can also [[streaming video|\"stream\"]] movies and TV shows over the [[Internet]] using subscription services such as [[Netflix]]). The development of Internet-based subscription services means that 2016-era home theatre users do not have to commute to a [[video rental store]] as was common in the 1980s and 1990s (nevertheless, some movie enthusiasts buy DVD or Blu-ray discs of their favourite content)\n\nIn the 2020s, a home cinema system typically uses a large projected image from a [[video projector]] or a large flat-screen high-resolution [[HDTV]] system, a [[movie]] or other video content on a [[DVD]] or high-resolution [[Blu-ray]] disc, which is played on a DVD player or Blu-ray player, with the audio augmented with a multi-channel [[power amplifier]] and anywhere from two speakers and a stereo power amp (for [[stereo sound]]) to a 5.1 channel amplifier and five or more [[surround sound]] speaker cabinets (with a surround sound system). Whether home cinema enthusiasts have a stereo set-up or a 5.1 channel surround system, they typically use at least one low-frequency [[subwoofer]] speaker cabinet to amplify low-frequency effects from movie soundtracks and reproduce the deep pitches from the musical soundtrack.\n\n==Introduction==\nIn the 1950s, playing [[home movies]] became popular in the United States with middle class and upper-class families as [[Eastman Kodak|Kodak]] [[8 mm film]] projector equipment became more affordable. The development of multi-channel audio systems and later [[LaserDisc]] in the 1980s created a new paradigm for [[home video]], as it enabled movie enthusiasts to add better sound and images to their setup. In the mid-1980s to the mid-1990s, a typical home cinema in the United States would have a [[LaserDisc]] or [[VHS]] player playing a movie, with the signal fed to a large [[rear-projection television]] set. Some people used expensive front projectors in a darkened viewing room. During the 1990s, watching movies on VHS at home became a popular leisure activity. Beginning in the late 1990s, and continuing throughout much of the 2000s, home-theater technology progressed with the development of the [[DVD-Video]] format (higher resolution than VHS), [http://www.dolby.com/us/en/technologies/dolby-digital.html Dolby Digital 5.1-channel audio] (\"[[surround sound]]\") speaker systems, and [[high-definition television]] (HDTV), which initially included bulky, heavy [[Cathode Ray Tube]] HDTVs and flat screen TVs.  In the 2010s, affordable large [[HDTV]] flatscreen TVs, high resolution [[video projector]]s (e.g., [[Digital Light Processing|DLP]]), [[3D television]] technology and the high resolution [[Blu-ray Disc]] (1080p) have ushered in a new era of home theater.\n\n===Recent developments===\nIn the 2010s, the term \"home cinema\" encompasses a range of systems meant for movie playback at home. The most basic and economical system could be a [[DVD player]], a [[standard definition]] (SD)  [[Large-screen television technology|large-screen television]] with at least a 27-inch (69&nbsp;cm) diagonal screen size, and an inexpensive \"[[home theater in a box]]\" surround sound amplifier/speaker system with a subwoofer. A more expensive home cinema set-up might include a Blu-ray disc player, [[home theater PC]] (HTPC) computer or [[digital media receiver]] streaming devices with a [[10-foot user interface]], a [[high-definition video|high-definition]] [[video projector]] and [[projection screen]] with over {{convert|100|in|ft m|adj=on}} diagonal screen size (or a large flatscreen HDTV), and a several-hundred-watt home theater receiver with five to eleven surround-sound speakers plus one or two powerful subwoofer(s). [[3D television|3D-TV]]-enabled home theaters make use of 3D TV sets/projectors and [[Blu-ray 3D]] players in which the viewers wear 3D-glasses, enabling them to see 3D content.\n\nHome cinema designs and layouts are a personal choice and the type of home cinema a user can set up depends on her/his budget and the space which is available within the home. The minimum set of requirements for a home theater are: a large television set or good quality [[video projector]] [[Cathode ray tube|CRT]] (no new models sold in U.S.), [[LCD]], [[Digital Light Processing]] (DLP), [[plasma display]], [[organic light-emitting diode]] (OLED), [[Silicon X-tal Reflective Display]] (SXRD), [[Laser TV]], rear-projection TV, [[video projector]], Standard-definition television (SDTV),  HDTV, or 3D-TV at least 27 inches (69&nbsp;cm) measured diagonally, an [[AV receiver]] or [[pre-amplifier]] (surround processor) and amplifier combination  capable of at least stereo sound but preferably 5.1 Channel Dolby Digital and [[DTS (sound system)|DTS]] audio, and something that plays or broadcasts movies in at least stereo sound such as a VHS HI-FI [[VCR]], LaserDisc player (no new stand-alone models of either are available; VHS VCRs are usually bundled in combo decks with DVD players), a DVD player, a Blu-ray disc player, [[Cable television|cable]] or [[Satellite television|satellite]] receiver, video game console, etc. Finally a set of speakers, at least two, are needed but more common are anywhere from six to eight with a subwoofer for bass or low-frequency effects.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://hometheater.about.com/od/hometheaterbasicsfaq/f/htbasicfaq8.htm|title=How Much Cash Do I Need For A Home Theater Setup?|author=|date=|website=about.com|accessdate=5 April 2018}}</ref>\n\nThe most-expensive home cinema set-ups, which can cost over $100,000 US, and which are in the homes of executives, [[celebrity|celebrities]] and high-earning professionals, have expensive, large, high-resolution digital [[Video projector|projector]]s and projection screens, and maybe even custom-built screening rooms which include cinema-style chairs and [[audiophile]]-grade sound equipment designed to mimic (or sometimes even exceed) commercial cinema performance.\n\n==Design==\n[[File:Basic Home Theatre Design Flow Diagram.svg|thumb|right|300px|This chart shows some of the design flow options for home theatre in the 2000s.]]\nIn the 2010s, many home cinema enthusiasts aim to replicate, to the degree that is possible, the \"[[movie theatre|cinema]] experience\". To do so, many home cinema buffs purchase higher quality components than used for everyday television viewing on a relatively small TV with only built-in speakers. A typical home cinema includes the following components:\n#'''Movie or other viewing content''': As the name implies, one of the key reasons for setting up a home cinema is to watch movies on a large screen, which does a more effective job at reproducing filmed images of vast landscapes or epic battle sequences. As of 2016, home cinema enthusiasts using \"Smart\" Blu-ray players may also watch DVDs of TV shows, and recorded or live sports events or music concerts. As well, with a \"Smart\" player, a user may be able to [[streaming video|\"stream\"]] movies, TV shows and other content over the [[Internet]]. Many 2016-era DVD players and Blu-ray players also have inputs which allow users to view [[digital photo]]s and other content on the big screen.\n#'''Video and audio input devices''': One or more video/audio sources. High resolution movie media formats such as Blu-ray discs are normally preferred, though DVD or video game console systems are also used. Some home theaters include a [[Home theater PC|HTPC (Home Theater PC)]] with a [[Home theater PC|media center]] software application to act as the main library for video and music content using a [[10-foot user interface]] and [[remote control]]. In 2016, some of the more-expensive [[Blu-ray]] players can [[streaming video|\"stream\"]] movies and TV shows over the [[Internet]].\n#'''Audio and video processing devices''': Input signals are processed by either a standalone [[AV receiver]] or a [[preamplifier]] and Sound Processor for complex [[surround sound]] formats such as [[Dolby Pro-Logic]]/and or [[Dolby Pro Logic#Dolby Pro Logic II|Pro-logic II]], X, and Z, Dolby Digital, DTS, [[Dolby Digital EX]], [[DTS-ES]], [[Dolby Digital Plus]], [[Dolby TrueHD]] and [[DTS-HD Master Audio]]. The user selects the input (e.g., DVD, Blu-ray player, streaming video, etc.) at this point before it is forwarded to the output stage. Some AV receivers enable the viewer to use a remote control to select which input device or source to use.\n#'''Audio output''': Systems consist of [[preamplifier]]s, [[power amplifier]]s (both of which may be integrated into a single [[AV receiver]]) and two or more [[loudspeaker]]s mounted in [[speaker enclosure]]s. The audio system requires at least a stereo [[power amplifier]] and two speakers, for [[stereo sound]]; most systems have multi-channel surround sound power amplifier and six or more speakers (a [[5.1 surround sound]] system has left and right front speakers, a centre speaker, left and right rear speakers and a low-frequency subwoofer [[speaker enclosure]]). Some users have 7.1 Surround Sound. It is possible to have up to 11 speakers with additional subwoofers.\n#'''Video output''': A large-screen display, typically an [[HDTV]]. Some users may have a [[3D TV]].  As of 2015, flatscreen HDTV is the norm. Options include [[Liquid crystal display television]] (LCD), [[plasma TV]], [[OLED]].<ref>{{cite web|last1=Feldstein|first1=Justin|title=Next Generation Televisions: Beyond Conventional LED and LCD Technologies|url=http://audioden.com/blog/item/next-generation-televisions-beyond-conventional-led-and-lcd-technologies|website=Audio Den|accessdate=11 April 2015}}</ref>  Home cinema users may also use a [[video projector]] and a [[movie screen]]. If a projector is used, a portable, temporary screen may be used or a screen may be permanently mounted on a wall.\n#'''Seating and atmosphere''': Comfortable seating is often provided to improve the cinema feel. Higher-end home theaters commonly also have sound insulation to prevent noise from escaping the room and specialized wall treatment to balance the sound within the room. Some luxury home cinemas have [[movie theatre]]-style padded chairs for guests.\n\n==Component systems vs. theater-in-a-box==\n[[File:Home cinema 01.jpg|thumb|left|A mid-level home theater system consisting of large-screen [[LCD television]], a [[Digibox|Sky+ HD]] satellite TV box, and a [[DVD player]] (and a Blu-ray Disc-capable [[PlayStation 3]] [[game console]]). The equipment is on a TV stand.]]\n\nHome cinemas can either be set up by purchasing individual components one by one (e.g., buying a multichannel amp from one manufacturer, a Blu-ray player from another manufacturer, speakers from another company, etc.) or a by purchasing a [[HTIB]] (Home Theater in a Box) package which includes all of components from a single manufacturer, with the exception of a TV or projector. HTIB systems typically include a DVD or Blu-ray player, a surround sound amplifier, five surround speakers, a subwoofer cabinet, cables and a remote. The benefit of purchasing separate components one by one is that consumers can attain improved quality in video or audio and better matching between the components and the needs of a specific room, or the consumer's needs.\n\nHowever, to buy individual components, a consumer must have knowledge of sound system and video system design and electronics and she or he must do research on the specifications of each component.  For instance, some speakers perform better in smaller rooms while others perform better in larger rooms and seating location must be considered. One of the challenges with buying all the components separately is that the purchaser must understand speaker impedance, power handling, and HDMI compatibility and cabling. Given these challenges, HTIB systems are a simpler and more cost-effective solution for many families and consumers; they are also better suited to smaller living spaces in semi-detached homes or apartments/condos where noise could be an issue. As well, buying an HTIB package is often less expensive than buying separate components.\n\n==Dedicated rooms==\n[[File:Projection-screen-home2.jpg|thumb|A large [[projection screen]] in a media room.]]\n[[File:Home-theater-tysto2.jpg|thumb|This example is of home theater screening room with [[video projector]] mounted in a box on the ceiling. Built-in shelves provide a place for movie decor, DVDs, and equipment. Note the component stack on the right, where the audio receiver, DVD player, secondary monitor, and video game system are located.]]\n\nSome home cinema enthusiasts build a dedicated room in their home for the theater. These more advanced installations often include sophisticated acoustic design elements, including \"room-in-a-room\" construction that isolates sound and provides an improved listening environment and a large screen, often using a high definition projector. These installations are often designated as \"screening rooms\" to differentiate them from simpler, less-expensive installations. In some movie enthusiast's home cinemas, this idea can go as far as completely recreating an actual small-scale cinema, with a projector enclosed in its own [[projection booth]], specialized furniture, curtains in front of the [[projection screen]], movie posters, or a [[popcorn]] or [[vending machine]] with [[snack food]] and candy. More commonly, real dedicated home theaters pursue this to a lesser degree.\n\nAs of 2016, the days of the $100,000 and over home cinema system is being usurped by the rapid advances in digital audio and video technologies, which has spurred a rapid drop in prices, making a home cinema set-up more affordable than ever before. This in turn has brought the true digital home theater experience to the doorsteps of the [[do-it-yourself]]ers, often for much less than the price of a low-budget economy car. As of 2016, consumer grade A/V equipment can meet some of the standards of a small modern commercial cinema (e.g., [[THX]] sound).\n\n===Seating===\nHome cinema seating consists of chairs or sofas specifically engineered and designed for viewing movies in a home cinema. Some home cinema seats have a [[cup holder]] built into the chairs' armrests and a shared armrest between each seat. Some seating has cinema-style chairs like those seen in a cinema, which feature a flip-up seat cushion. Other seating systems have plush leather reclining lounger types, with flip-out footrests. Available features include storage compartments, snack trays, [[tactile transducer]]s for low-frequency effects that can be felt through a chair (without creating high volume levels which could disturb other family members), and electric motors to adjust the chair. Home cinema seating tends to be more comfortable than seats in a public cinema.<ref>[http://articles.org/create-your-own-home-theater/ \"Create Your Own Home Theater\"], by Stargate Sonem, Articles Organization Free Directory.</ref>\n\n==Backyard cinema==\nIn homes that have an adequately sized backyard, it is possible for people to set up a home cinema in an outdoor area. Depending on the space available, it may simply be a temporary version with foldable screen, a video projector and couple of speakers, or a permanent fixture with a huge screen and dedicated audio set-up mounted in a weather-proof cabinet. Outdoor home cinemas are popular with BBQ parties and [[swimming pool|pool]] parties. Some specialist outdoor home-cinema companies are now marketing packages with [[inflatable movie screen]]s and purpose-built AV systems. Some people have expanded the idea and constructed mobile [[drive-in theater]]s that can play movies in public open spaces. Usually, these require a powerful projector, a laptop or DVD player, outdoor speakers or an FM transmitter to broadcast the audio to other [[car audio|car radios]].\n\n==History==\n\n===1950s\u20131970s===\nIn the 1950s, home movies became popular in the United States and elsewhere as [[Eastman Kodak|Kodak]] [[8 mm film]] ([[Path\u00e9]] 9.5&nbsp;mm in France) and camera and projector equipment became affordable. Projected with a small, portable [[movie projector]] onto a portable screen, often without sound, this system became the first practical home theater. They were generally used to show [[home movies]] of family travels and celebrations, but they also doubled as a means of showing some commercial films, or private [[pornography|stag film]]s. Dedicated home cinemas were called ''screening rooms'' at the time and were outfitted with 16&nbsp;mm or even 35&nbsp;mm projectors for showing commercial films. These were found almost exclusively in the homes of the very wealthy, especially those in the movie industry.\n\nPortable home cinemas improved over time with colour film, Kodak [[Super 8 mm film]] cartridges, and monaural sound but remained awkward and somewhat expensive. The rise of [[home video]] in the late 1970s almost completely killed the consumer market for 8&nbsp;mm film cameras and projectors, as VCRs connected to ordinary televisions provided a simpler and more flexible substitute.\n\n===1980s===\nThe development of multi-channel audio systems and [[LaserDisc]] in the 1980s added new dimensions for home cinema. The first-known home cinema system was designed, built and installed by Steve J. LaFontaine as a sales tool at Kirshmans furniture store in Metairie, Louisiana in 1974. He built a special sound room which incorporated the earliest quadraphonic audio systems, and he modified [[Sony Trinitron]] televisions for projecting the image. Many systems were sold in the New Orleans area in the ensuing years before the first public demonstration of this integration occurred in 1982 at the Summer Consumer Electronics Show in Chicago, Illinois. Peter Tribeman of NAD (U.S.) organized and presented a demonstration made possible by the collaborative effort of NAD, Proton, ADS, Lucasfilm and Dolby Labs, who contributed their technologies to demonstrate what a home cinema would \"look and sound\" like.\n\nOver the course of three days, retailers, manufacturers, and members of the consumer electronics press were exposed to the first \"home-like\" experience of combining a high-quality video source with multi-channel surround sound. That one demonstration is credited with being the impetus for developing what is now a multibillion-dollar business.\n\n===1990s===\nIn the early to mid-1990s, a typical home cinema would have a LaserDisc or VHS player fed to a large screen: rear projection for the more-affordable setups, and LCD or CRT front-projection in the more-elaborate systems. In the late 1990s, a new wave of home-cinema interest was sparked by the development of [[DVD-Video]], Dolby Digital and DTS 5.1-channel audio, and high-quality front video projectors that provide a cinema experience at a price that rivals a big-screen HDTV.\n\n===2000s===\n[[File:2000s home theater, \"California Casual\".jpg|thumb|A home cinema from the late 2000s, using a [[rear projection television]].]]\nIn the 2000s, developments such as [[high-definition video]], [[Blu-ray]] disc (as well as the now-obsolete [[HD DVD]] format, which lost the [[format war]] to Blu-ray) and newer high-definition 3D display technologies enabled people to enjoy a cinematic feeling in their own home at a  more-affordable price.  Newer [[lossless audio]] from Dolby Digital Plus, Dolby TrueHD, [[Digital Theater System|DTS-HD High Resolution Audio]] and [[DTS-HD Master Audio]] and speaker systems with more audio channels (such as 6.1, 7.1, 9.1, 9.2, [[10.2 surround sound|10.2]], and [[22.2 surround sound|22.2]]) were also introduced for a more cinematic feeling.\n\n===2010s===\n[[File:LG\uc804\uc790, 3D \ud648\uc2dc\uc5b4\ud130\ub85c \ubd81\ubbf8 3D AV \uc2dc\uc7a5 \uacf5\ub7b5 \uac15\ud654.jpg|thumb|right|200px|A store display for a home cinema package at a [[consumer electronics]] retailer. Some stores \"bundle\" home cinema components into a package which can be purchased for a lower cost than buying each component separately.]]\nBy the mid-2010s, the Blu-ray Disc medium had become a common home media standard, and online video streaming sources such as Netflix and YouTube were offering a range of high definition content, including some [[4K resolution|4K]] content (although various compression technologies are applied to make this streamed content feasible). The first [[4K Blu-ray]] discs were released in 2016. By this point, 4K TVs and computer monitors were rapidly declining in price and increasing in prevalence, despite a lack of native 4K content. While many DSP systems existed, DTS-HD Master Audio remained the studio standard for lossless [[surround sound]] encoding on Blu-ray, with five or seven native discrete channels. High definition video projectors also continued to improve and decrease in price, relative to performance.\n\nAs a result of continuing price reductions, large (up to 80<nowiki>''</nowiki>) TVs became a financially competitive alternative to video projectors in living room or even smaller dedicated room setups.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.digitaltrends.com/home-theater/projectors-vs-tvs/2/|title=Is there any reason to own a projector when big TVs are so cheap?

For this application, it is a measure of a room's [[ambient noise level]] at various frequencies. For example, in order for a theater to be [[THX]] certified, it must have an ambient sound level of NC-30 or less. This helps to retain the [[dynamic range]] of the system.<ref>Wood, Mike (2002).

In the 1980s, home cinemas typically consisted of a movie pre-recorded on a LaserDisc or VHS tape; a  [[LaserDisc]] or [[VHS]] player; and a heavy, bulky large-screen [[cathode ray tube]] TV set, although sometimes [[CRT projector]]s were used instead. In the 2000s, technological innovations in sound systems, video player equipment and TV screens and [[video projector]]s have changed the equipment used in home cinema set-ups and enabled home users to experience a higher-resolution screen image, improved sound quality and components that offer users more options (e.g., many of the more expensive [[Blu-ray]] players in 2016 can also [[streaming video|\"stream\"]] movies and TV shows over the [[Internet]] using subscription services such as [[Netflix]]). The development of Internet-based subscription services means that 2016-era home theatre users do not have to commute to a [[video rental store]] as was common in the 1980s and 1990s (nevertheless, some movie enthusiasts buy DVD or Blu-ray discs of their favourite content)\n\nIn the 2020s, a home cinema system typically uses a large projected image from a [[video projector]] or a large flat-screen high-resolution [[HDTV]] system, a [[movie]] or other video content on a [[DVD]] or high-resolution [[Blu-ray]] disc, which is played on a DVD player or Blu-ray player, with the audio augmented with a multi-channel [[power amplifier]] and anywhere from two speakers and a stereo power amp (for [[stereo sound]]) to a 5.1 channel amplifier and five or more [[surround sound]] speaker cabinets (with a surround sound system). Whether home cinema enthusiasts have a stereo set-up or a 5.1 channel surround system, they typically use at least one low-frequency [[subwoofer]] speaker cabinet to amplify low-frequency effects from movie soundtracks and reproduce the deep pitches from the musical soundtrack.\n\n==Introduction==\nIn the 1950s, playing [[home movies]] became popular in the United States with middle class and upper-class families as [[Eastman Kodak|Kodak]] [[8 mm film]] projector equipment became more affordable. The development of multi-channel audio systems and later [[LaserDisc]] in the 1980s created a new paradigm for [[home video]], as it enabled movie enthusiasts to add better sound and images to their setup. In the mid-1980s to the mid-1990s, a typical home cinema in the United States would have a [[LaserDisc]] or [[VHS]] player playing a movie, with the signal fed to a large [[rear-projection television]] set. Some people used expensive front projectors in a darkened viewing room. During the 1990s, watching movies on VHS at home became a popular leisure activity. Beginning in the late 1990s, and continuing throughout much of the 2000s, home-theater technology progressed with the development of the [[DVD-Video]] format (higher resolution than VHS), [http://www.dolby.com/us/en/technologies/dolby-digital.html Dolby Digital 5.1-channel audio] (\"[[surround sound]]\") speaker systems, and [[high-definition television]] (HDTV), which initially included bulky, heavy [[Cathode Ray Tube]] HDTVs and flat screen TVs.  In the 2010s, affordable large [[HDTV]] flatscreen TVs, high resolution [[video projector]]s (e.g., [[Digital Light Processing|DLP]]), [[3D television]] technology and the high resolution [[Blu-ray Disc]] (1080p) have ushered in a new era of home theater.\n\n===Recent developments===\nIn the 2010s, the term \"home cinema\" encompasses a range of systems meant for movie playback at home. The most basic and economical system could be a [[DVD player]], a [[standard definition]] (SD)  [[Large-screen television technology|large-screen television]] with at least a 27-inch (69&nbsp;cm) diagonal screen size, and an inexpensive \"[[home theater in a box]]\" surround sound amplifier/speaker system with a subwoofer. A more expensive home cinema set-up might include a Blu-ray disc player, [[home theater PC]] (HTPC) computer or [[digital media receiver]] streaming devices with a [[10-foot user interface]], a [[high-definition video|high-definition]] [[video projector]] and [[projection screen]] with over {{convert|100|in|ft m|adj=on}} diagonal screen size (or a large flatscreen HDTV), and a several-hundred-watt home theater receiver with five to eleven surround-sound speakers plus one or two powerful subwoofer(s). [[3D television|3D-TV]]-enabled home theaters make use of 3D TV sets/projectors and [[Blu-ray 3D]] players in which the viewers wear 3D-glasses, enabling them to see 3D content.\n\nHome cinema designs and layouts are a personal choice and the type of home cinema a user can set up depends on her/his budget and the space which is available within the home. The minimum set of requirements for a home theater are: a large television set or good quality [[video projector]] [[Cathode ray tube|CRT]] (no new models sold in U.S.), [[LCD]], [[Digital Light Processing]] (DLP), [[plasma display]], [[organic light-emitting diode]] (OLED), [[Silicon X-tal Reflective Display]] (SXRD), [[Laser TV]], rear-projection TV, [[video projector]], Standard-definition television (SDTV),  HDTV, or 3D-TV at least 27 inches (69&nbsp;cm) measured diagonally, an [[AV receiver]] or [[pre-amplifier]] (surround processor) and amplifier combination  capable of at least stereo sound but preferably 5.1 Channel Dolby Digital and [[DTS (sound system)|DTS]] audio, and something that plays or broadcasts movies in at least stereo sound such as a VHS HI-FI [[VCR]], LaserDisc player (no new stand-alone models of either are available; VHS VCRs are usually bundled in combo decks with DVD players), a DVD player, a Blu-ray disc player, [[Cable television|cable]] or [[Satellite television|satellite]] receiver, video game console, etc. Finally a set of speakers, at least two, are needed but more common are anywhere from six to eight with a subwoofer for bass or low-frequency effects.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://hometheater.about.com/od/hometheaterbasicsfaq/f/htbasicfaq8.htm|title=How Much Cash Do I Need For A Home Theater Setup?|author=|date=|website=about.com|accessdate=5 April 2018}}</ref>\n\nThe most-expensive home cinema set-ups, which can cost over $100,000 US, and which are in the homes of executives, [[celebrity|celebrities]] and high-earning professionals, have expensive, large, high-resolution digital [[Video projector|projector]]s and projection screens, and maybe even custom-built screening rooms which include cinema-style chairs and [[audiophile]]-grade sound equipment designed to mimic (or sometimes even exceed) commercial cinema performance.\n\n==Design==\n[[File:Basic Home Theatre Design Flow Diagram.svg|thumb|right|300px|This chart shows some of the design flow options for home theatre in the 2000s.]]\nIn the 2010s, many home cinema enthusiasts aim to replicate, to the degree that is possible, the \"[[movie theatre|cinema]] experience\". To do so, many home cinema buffs purchase higher quality components than used for everyday television viewing on a relatively small TV with only built-in speakers. A typical home cinema includes the following components:\n#'''Movie or other viewing content''': As the name implies, one of the key reasons for setting up a home cinema is to watch movies on a large screen, which does a more effective job at reproducing filmed images of vast landscapes or epic battle sequences. As of 2016, home cinema enthusiasts using \"Smart\" Blu-ray players may also watch DVDs of TV shows, and recorded or live sports events or music concerts. As well, with a \"Smart\" player, a user may be able to [[streaming video|\"stream\"]] movies, TV shows and other content over the [[Internet]]. Many 2016-era DVD players and Blu-ray players also have inputs which allow users to view [[digital photo]]s and other content on the big screen.\n#'''Video and audio input devices''': One or more video/audio sources. High resolution movie media formats such as Blu-ray discs are normally preferred, though DVD or video game console systems are also used. Some home theaters include a [[Home theater PC|HTPC (Home Theater PC)]] with a [[Home theater PC|media center]] software application to act as the main library for video and music content using a [[10-foot user interface]] and [[remote control]]. In 2016, some of the more-expensive [[Blu-ray]] players can [[streaming video|\"stream\"]] movies and TV shows over the [[Internet]].\n#'''Audio and video processing devices''': Input signals are processed by either a standalone [[AV receiver]] or a [[preamplifier]] and Sound Processor for complex [[surround sound]] formats such as [[Dolby Pro-Logic]]/and or [[Dolby Pro Logic#Dolby Pro Logic II|Pro-logic II]], X, and Z, Dolby Digital, DTS, [[Dolby Digital EX]], [[DTS-ES]], [[Dolby Digital Plus]], [[Dolby TrueHD]] and [[DTS-HD Master Audio]].

Some home cinema seats have a [[cup holder]] built into the chairs' armrests and a shared armrest between each seat. Some seating has cinema-style chairs like those seen in a cinema, which feature a flip-up seat cushion. Other seating systems have plush leather reclining lounger types, with flip-out footrests. Available features include storage compartments, snack trays, [[tactile transducer]]s for low-frequency effects that can be felt through a chair (without creating high volume levels which could disturb other family members), and electric motors to adjust the chair. Home cinema seating tends to be more comfortable than seats in a public cinema.<ref>[http://articles.org/create-your-own-home-theater/ \"Create Your Own Home Theater\"], by Stargate Sonem, Articles Organization Free Directory.</ref>\n\n==Backyard cinema==\nIn homes that have an adequately sized backyard, it is possible for people to set up a home cinema in an outdoor area. Depending on the space available, it may simply be a temporary version with foldable screen, a video projector and couple of speakers, or a permanent fixture with a huge screen and dedicated audio set-up mounted in a weather-proof cabinet. Outdoor home cinemas are popular with BBQ parties and [[swimming pool|pool]] parties. Some specialist outdoor home-cinema companies are now marketing packages with [[inflatable movie screen]]s and purpose-built AV systems. Some people have expanded the idea and constructed mobile [[drive-in theater]]s that can play movies in public open spaces. Usually, these require a powerful projector, a laptop or DVD player, outdoor speakers or an FM transmitter to broadcast the audio to other [[car audio|car radios]].\n\n==History==\n\n===1950s\u20131970s===\nIn the 1950s, home movies became popular in the United States and elsewhere as [[Eastman Kodak|Kodak]] [[8 mm film]] ([[Path\u00e9]] 9.5&nbsp;mm in France) and camera and projector equipment became affordable. Projected with a small, portable [[movie projector]] onto a portable screen, often without sound, this system became the first practical home theater. They were generally used to show [[home movies]] of family travels and celebrations, but they also doubled as a means of showing some commercial films, or private [[pornography|stag film]]s. Dedicated home cinemas were called ''screening rooms'' at the time and were outfitted with 16&nbsp;mm or even 35&nbsp;mm projectors for showing commercial films. These were found almost exclusively in the homes of the very wealthy, especially those in the movie industry.\n\nPortable home cinemas improved over time with colour film, Kodak [[Super 8 mm film]] cartridges, and monaural sound but remained awkward and somewhat expensive. The rise of [[home video]] in the late 1970s almost completely killed the consumer market for 8&nbsp;mm film cameras and projectors, as VCRs connected to ordinary televisions provided a simpler and more flexible substitute.\n\n===1980s===\nThe development of multi-channel audio systems and [[LaserDisc]] in the 1980s added new dimensions for home cinema. The first-known home cinema system was designed, built and installed by Steve J. LaFontaine as a sales tool at Kirshmans furniture store in Metairie, Louisiana in 1974. He built a special sound room which incorporated the earliest quadraphonic audio systems, and he modified [[Sony Trinitron]] televisions for projecting the image. Many systems were sold in the New Orleans area in the ensuing years before the first public demonstration of this integration occurred in 1982 at the Summer Consumer Electronics Show in Chicago, Illinois. Peter Tribeman of NAD (U.S.) organized and presented a demonstration made possible by the collaborative effort of NAD, Proton, ADS, Lucasfilm and Dolby Labs, who contributed their technologies to demonstrate what a home cinema would \"look and sound\" like.\n\nOver the course of three days, retailers, manufacturers, and members of the consumer electronics press were exposed to the first \"home-like\" experience of combining a high-quality video source with multi-channel surround sound. That one demonstration is credited with being the impetus for developing what is now a multibillion-dollar business.\n\n===1990s===\nIn the early to mid-1990s, a typical home cinema would have a LaserDisc or VHS player fed to a large screen: rear projection for the more-affordable setups, and LCD or CRT front-projection in the more-elaborate systems. In the late 1990s, a new wave of home-cinema interest was sparked by the development of [[DVD-Video]], Dolby Digital and DTS 5.1-channel audio, and high-quality front video projectors that provide a cinema experience at a price that rivals a big-screen HDTV.\n\n===2000s===\n[[File:2000s home theater, \"California Casual\".jpg|thumb|A home cinema from the late 2000s, using a [[rear projection television]].]]\nIn the 2000s, developments such as [[high-definition video]], [[Blu-ray]] disc (as well as the now-obsolete [[HD DVD]] format, which lost the [[format war]] to Blu-ray) and newer high-definition 3D display technologies enabled people to enjoy a cinematic feeling in their own home at a  more-affordable price.  Newer [[lossless audio]] from Dolby Digital Plus, Dolby TrueHD, [[Digital Theater System|DTS-HD High Resolution Audio]] and [[DTS-HD Master Audio]] and speaker systems with more audio channels (such as 6.1, 7.1, 9.1, 9.2, [[10.2 surround sound|10.2]], and [[22.2 surround sound|22.2]]) were also introduced for a more cinematic feeling.\n\n===2010s===\n[[File:LG\uc804\uc790, 3D \ud648\uc2dc\uc5b4\ud130\ub85c \ubd81\ubbf8 3D AV \uc2dc\uc7a5 \uacf5\ub7b5 \uac15\ud654.jpg|thumb|right|200px|A store display for a home cinema package at a [[consumer electronics]] retailer. Some stores \"bundle\" home cinema components into a package which can be purchased for a lower cost than buying each component separately.]]\nBy the mid-2010s, the Blu-ray Disc medium had become a common home media standard, and online video streaming sources such as Netflix and YouTube were offering a range of high definition content, including some [[4K resolution|4K]] content (although various compression technologies are applied to make this streamed content feasible). The first [[4K Blu-ray]] discs were released in 2016. By this point, 4K TVs and computer monitors were rapidly declining in price and increasing in prevalence, despite a lack of native 4K content. While many DSP systems existed, DTS-HD Master Audio remained the studio standard for lossless [[surround sound]] encoding on Blu-ray, with five or seven native discrete channels. High definition video projectors also continued to improve and decrease in price, relative to performance.\n\nAs a result of continuing price reductions, large (up to 80<nowiki>''</nowiki>) TVs became a financially competitive alternative to video projectors in living room or even smaller dedicated room setups.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.digitaltrends.com/home-theater/projectors-vs-tvs/2/|title=Is there any reason to own a projector when big TVs are so cheap?

For this application, it is a measure of a room's [[ambient noise level]] at various frequencies. For example, in order for a theater to be [[THX]] certified, it must have an ambient sound level of NC-30 or less. This helps to retain the [[dynamic range]] of the system.<ref>Wood, Mike (2002). [https://archive.today/20130125215355/http://www.hometheater.com/bootcamp/140/ \"Design the Ultimate Home Theater\u2014On a Budget.\"] ''Home Theater.''</ref> Some NC levels are:\n\n*NC 40: Significant but not a dooming level of ambient noise; the highest \"acceptable\" ambient noise level. 40 decibels is the lower [[sound pressure level]] of normal talking; 60 being the highest.\n*NC 30: A good NC level; necessary for THX certification in cinemas.\n*NC 20: An excellent NC level; difficult to attain in large rooms and sought after for dedicated home cinema systems. For example, for a home cinema to be THX certified, it has to have a rating of NC 22.<ref>DeBoer, Clint (2007).[http://www.audioholics.com/news/trade-show-coverage/2004-cedia-expo/thx-certified-home-theater-program \"THX Certified Home Theater Program.\"] ''Audioholics Online A/V Magazine.''</ref>\n*NC 10: Virtually impossible noise criteria to attain; 10 decibels is associated with the sound level of calm breathing.\n\nProjectors used for home cinemas have a set of recommended criteria:\n\n*Brightness, usually at least 1800 [[lumen (unit)|lumen]]s.\n*Resolution (the number of [[pixel]]s making up the image), usually at least 1920\u00d71080, one of the [[HDTV]] standards.\n*Contrast (how well white, black and greyscales are displayed), usually a minimum of 5000:1.{{Elucidate|date=February 2016}}\n*[[HDMI]] connection sockets (Although some people use older [[Component video]],connections with three-cord sockets for the different individual colours)\n*Good quality manufacturers, although this is a subjective element which depends upon user tastes and budget.

From the Liljenquist Family Collection of Civil War Photographs, Prints and Photographs Division, [[Library of Congress]]]]\n\nThe '''38th Regiment Massachusetts Volunteer Infantry''' was an [[infantry]] [[regiment]] in the [[Union Army]] during the [[American Civil War]]. Companies A, B, and C organized at [[Camp Cameron]] in [[Cambridge, Massachusetts]] in July and August 1862. The remaining seven companies were organized at [[Camp Stanton]] in [[Lynnfield, Massachusetts]] and mustered into service from August 20 to 22. Colonel Timothy Ingraham initially commanded the regiment.<ref>Bowen, 576.</ref>\n\nAfter two month's [[garrison]] duty in [[Baltimore, Maryland|Baltimore]], the regiment embarked for [[Louisiana]], being assigned to the [[Army of the Gulf]] which was commanded by [[Major general (United States)|Major General]] [[Nathaniel P. Banks]]. The regiment saw its first combat during the [[Battle of Fort Bisland]] in southern Louisiana. During May and June 1863, the 38th Massachusetts took part in the [[Siege of Port Hudson]] and the assaults on that city on May 27 and June 14, suffering considerable casualties. After the surrender of Port Hudson on July 9, the regiment participated in the ill-fated [[Red River Campaign]].<ref>Bowen, 579.</ref>\n\nIn July 1864, the [[XIX Corps (Union Army)|XIX Corps]], of which the 38th Massachusetts was a part, was transferred to the [[Shenandoah Valley]] in [[Virginia]] and were attached to the [[Union Army of the Shenandoah|Army of the Shenandoah]] commanded by Maj. Gen. [[Philip Sheridan]]. The 38th Massachusetts was engaged in several battles of the [[Valley Campaigns of 1864]], mostly notably the [[Third Battle of Winchester]] on September 19, 1864 and the [[Battle of Cedar Creek]] on October 19, 1864 where they suffered significant casualties.<ref>Powers, 167 and 171.</ref><ref>Bowen, 586.</ref>\n\nIn January 1865, the 38th Massachusetts left the Shenandoah Valley, being transferred to [[North Carolina]]. They served guard duty in various locations during the spring of 1865 including [[Morehead City, North Carolina|Morehead City]] and [[Goldsboro, North Carolina|Goldsboro]]. The regiment's 3-year term of service ended in July 1865. Although the war was over, regiments were still needed to serve garrison duty in the South.

A, 38th Massachusetts Infantry Regiment. From the Liljenquist Family Collection of Civil War Photographs, Prints and Photographs Division, [[Library of Congress]]]]\n\nThe '''38th Regiment Massachusetts Volunteer Infantry''' was an [[infantry]] [[regiment]] in the [[Union Army]] during the [[American Civil War]]. Companies A, B, and C organized at [[Camp Cameron]] in [[Cambridge, Massachusetts]] in July and August 1862. The remaining seven companies were organized at [[Camp Stanton]] in [[Lynnfield, Massachusetts]] and mustered into service from August 20 to 22. Colonel Timothy Ingraham initially commanded the regiment.<ref>Bowen, 576.</ref>\n\nAfter two month's [[garrison]] duty in [[Baltimore, Maryland|Baltimore]], the regiment embarked for [[Louisiana]], being assigned to the [[Army of the Gulf]] which was commanded by [[Major general (United States)|Major General]] [[Nathaniel P. Banks]]. The regiment saw its first combat during the [[Battle of Fort Bisland]] in southern Louisiana. During May and June 1863, the 38th Massachusetts took part in the [[Siege of Port Hudson]] and the assaults on that city on May 27 and June 14, suffering considerable casualties. After the surrender of Port Hudson on July 9, the regiment participated in the ill-fated [[Red River Campaign]].<ref>Bowen, 579.</ref>\n\nIn July 1864, the [[XIX Corps (Union Army)|XIX Corps]], of which the 38th Massachusetts was a part, was transferred to the [[Shenandoah Valley]] in [[Virginia]] and were attached to the [[Union Army of the Shenandoah|Army of the Shenandoah]] commanded by Maj. Gen. [[Philip Sheridan]]. The 38th Massachusetts was engaged in several battles of the [[Valley Campaigns of 1864]], mostly notably the [[Third Battle of Winchester]] on September 19, 1864 and the [[Battle of Cedar Creek]] on October 19, 1864 where they suffered significant casualties.<ref>Powers, 167 and 171.</ref><ref>Bowen, 586.</ref>\n\nIn January 1865, the 38th Massachusetts left the Shenandoah Valley, being transferred to [[North Carolina]]. They served guard duty in various locations during the spring of 1865 including [[Morehead City, North Carolina|Morehead City]] and [[Goldsboro, North Carolina|Goldsboro]]. The regiment's 3-year term of service ended in July 1865. Although the war was over, regiments were still needed to serve garrison duty in the South. A portion of the remaining men of the 38th Massachusetts chose to reenlist and were transferred to the [[26th Regiment Massachusetts Volunteer Infantry|26th Massachusetts]]. The rest were shipped home and the 38th Massachusetts was mustered out of service on [[Gallops Island]] in [[Boston, Massachusetts|Boston]] Harbor on July 13, 1865.<ref>Bowen, 588.</ref>\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n\n*{{cite book\n| url         = https://www.google.com/books/edition/Massachusetts_in_the_War_1861_1865/4_lYAAAAMAAJ?hl=en&gbpv=1&dq=Massachusetts+in+the+War+1861-1865+James+L+Bowen&pg=PR15&printsec=frontcover\n| author      = Bowen, James L\n| title       = Massachusetts in the War 1861&ndash;1865\n| publisher   = Clark W Bryer + Co\n| location    = Springfield, MA\n| year        = 1889\n| oclc        = 1986476 \n| url-access  = \n}}{{PD-notice}}\n*{{cite book\n| url         = https://archive.org/details/08697590.3359.emory.edu\n| title       = A Compendium of the War of the Rebellion\n| author      = Dyer, Frederick H. \n| publisher   = Dyer Pub.

Based in [[Montreal]], [[Quebec]], the unit was authorized on September 15, 1915, as an exclusively Canadian Grenadier Guards (CGG) formation with Guards uniforms and accoutrements approved by The [[Governor General of Canada]], HRH, Duke of Connaught (Colonel of the Canadian Grenadier Guards). Mobilization and recruiting for soldiers began on October 23, 1915.   \n  \nMore than 4,213 men served in the 87th Battalion, representing all regions of Canada, but predominantly Ontario, until&nbsp; the last few months of the&nbsp; war&nbsp; when the balance was furnished by soldiers from Quebec (included the need to form a&nbsp; francophone coy.) The Battalion earned 17  Battle Honours at a cost&nbsp; of 886 dead & 2,246 wounded, many of them wounded multiple times.  \n[[File:87th Battalion badges.jpg|thumb|Badges of the 87th Battalion (Canadian Grenadier Guards) CEF - Hayes-Rivet (MHR) collection]]\n\n== Unit distinctions & achievements ==\nThe 87th Battalion (Canadian Grenadier Guards) CEF holds several distinctions in compared to other CEF battalions:\n* CGG was one of only 7 Militia Regiments (out of 51 CEF units) to recruit their own battalions that fought as a distinct unit within the Canadian Corps.\n* The 87th Battalion was one of only 3 Canadian units authorized by the Minister of Militia, Sir Sam Hughes, to recruit across all of Canada. The other 2 were the [[Royal Canadian Regiment]] and [[Princess Patricia's Canadian Light Infantry]].\n* The 87th Battalion was the only Canadian Foot Guards CEF unit active during The Great War. The Governor Generals Foot Guards (GGFG) contributed volunteers for the 2nd Battalion (Eastern Ontario Regiment), CEF, and the 77th Battalion CEF (Ottawa), CEF. The Governor Generals Horse Guards (GGHG) contributed men for the 4th and 7th Canadian Mounted Rifles (Bantams) CEF, but these were composite or regional units (more on that later) and none bore the title or accoutrements of Guards.\n* Title of 'Guardsman' was awarded by [[King George V]] in 1919 as a permanent distinction in conjunction with all other Guards units, in recognition of their collective contributions to victory in the Great War.\n* 87th Battalion were the first to liberate Belgium on 5 November, 1918. Patrols from the 87th Battalion (Canadian Grenadier Guards), of the 4th Division, crossed the River Aunelle, thereby marking the liberation, by the Canadians, of the first part of occupied Belgium.\n* The 87th Battalion boast having within it\u2019s ranks 4 members who Founded/Formed CEF Battalions during WWI: BGen Frank S. Meighen (14th and 87th Bns); Col. Hercule Barre (150th Bn) ; Maj. Olivar F-J. Asselin (163rd Bn); and LCol J. V. O'Donahoe, (199th Bn)\n\n== Unit milestones ==\n=== Mobilization and England ===\nThe 87th Battalion departed Canada after boarding R.M.S. [[RMS Empress of Britain (1905)|''Empress of Britain'']] on April 23, 1916 and arrived in Liverpool, England on May 5, 1916. The battalion arrived and billeted on May 27 at Bramshott Military Camp as part of the 12th Infantry Brigade (until June 1916) and then designated as part of the 11th Infantry Brigade of the 4th Canadian Infantry Division in August of the same year. During the period in England, the battalion received training from an officer and four drill sergeants from the British Grenadier Guards, all trench veterans, all previously wounded in action (WIA). On August 11/12, the battalion crossed over to France and landed at Le Havre, France on August 13, 1916 with a total strength of 1,090 all ranks. The battalion served the duration of the war as part of the 11th Infantry Brigade, 4th Canadian Infantry Division.\n\n=== First Actions & casualties ===\nFollowing the [[Battle of Mont Sorrel]], 303 members of the 87th Battalion were detached to reinforce the [[1st Battalion (Ontario Regiment), CEF]]. Of these CGG members, two, 177281 Private John Leitch, (later KIA 9 April, 1917), and 178218 Private William Anson Ogilvie, would distinguish themselves with the 1st Battalion during the Battle of the Somme and win multiple Military Medals for bravery in the field. The initial loss of men were replaced by 391 officers & men from the 77th, Battalion, (Ottawa) CEF, from the GGFG. The battalion was introduced and indoctrinated into trench warfare beginning August 18, 1916 in the Ypres area. Their first casualties, two wounded, occurred that same day. The first 87th Battalion fatality occurred on August 26, 1916. Total casualties for the first weeks of the war were eventually 17 KIA / 25 WIA. On September 16, 1916, the 87th battalion participated in their first trench raid resulting in 36 casualties out of 60 engaged unit members.\n\n===  Battle of the Somme ===\nOn 10 October, 1916, the 87th Battalion was relocated to Albert area along the Ancre area and on the 21 October, attacked and took a section of Regina Trench. The first gallantry awards earned by the 87th Battalion were awarded to four members for the attack on Regina Trench, CSM W. Blaney, Sgt. J.C. Noon, Ptes J.E. Blaney, and J.D. Hunter. After some routine activities and tours along the front, on November 18, the 87th Battalion was assigned to capture a section of Desire Trench, as well as its support systems. The attack was launched from Regina Trench. It succeeded well beyond expectations, and in addition to capturing Desire, Major Franklin Hall, with 41 volunteers, with only their rifles, bayonets, grenades and 2 Lewis Guns advanced a further 500 yards and captured part of Grandcourt Trench, including taking 115 prisoners. 80 of these were taken unaided by four privates; Roy, Thompson, Garneau and Winke.  \n[[File:Plan of Attack Vimy Ridge.jpg|thumb|87th Battalion was to advance as part of the 11th Brigage, 4th Division. (2nd from top) Plan of Attack for Vimy Ridge 9 April 1917]]\n\n=== Battle of Vimy Ridge ===\nThe Battle of Vimy Ridge was a terrible tragedy for the battalion. Progress on the right was slow because, for a time and in part, the centre had practically collapsed.The 87th Battalion (Canadian Grenadier Guards) were in the first wave but for some reason, a section of enemy trench barely a hundred metres in front of them had been left untouched by the artillery bombardment. (it has been suggested that the 87th Battalion commanding officer, Major Harold Leroy Shaw wanted to use it as a first-aid station and battalion headquarters later on.) Subsequently,the company assaulting it was virtually wiped out in just six minutes, and \u2018sixty per cent of its strength lay dead on the ground.\u2019It was not a good beginning, delaying the other guardsmen so that they lost the barrage, and those who tried to continue the advance were cut down by German machine gunners firing from positions of relative safety in the untouched trenches.   \n\nThe 87th Battalion War diaries reports that six of the seven officers leading the 87th into battle were killed or wounded within the first hours. \"Word had been received that Captain Harry Sare, (Officer Commanding the Assault), had been shot through the head with a bullet and could no longer carry on. Lieutenant Yonkles had also been hit in the left arm, Majors Joy and Ross and Lieut. Savage had been killed, and Lieut. Sinclair badly wounded, leaving Lieutenant Hannaford the only available officer of those who went over.\" The 87th diary names 11 officers killed or wounded and notes 110 other ranks killed, 157 wounded and 25 missing.    \n\n==Officers Commanding==\n*Lieut.-Col.

Based in [[Montreal]], [[Quebec]], the unit was authorized on September 15, 1915, as an exclusively Canadian Grenadier Guards (CGG) formation with Guards uniforms and accoutrements approved by The [[Governor General of Canada]], HRH, Duke of Connaught (Colonel of the Canadian Grenadier Guards). Mobilization and recruiting for soldiers began on October 23, 1915.   \n  \nMore than 4,213 men served in the 87th Battalion, representing all regions of Canada, but predominantly Ontario, until&nbsp; the last few months of the&nbsp; war&nbsp; when the balance was furnished by soldiers from Quebec (included the need to form a&nbsp; francophone coy.) The Battalion earned 17  Battle Honours at a cost&nbsp; of 886 dead & 2,246 wounded, many of them wounded multiple times.  \n[[File:87th Battalion badges.jpg|thumb|Badges of the 87th Battalion (Canadian Grenadier Guards) CEF - Hayes-Rivet (MHR) collection]]\n\n== Unit distinctions & achievements ==\nThe 87th Battalion (Canadian Grenadier Guards) CEF holds several distinctions in compared to other CEF battalions:\n* CGG was one of only 7 Militia Regiments (out of 51 CEF units) to recruit their own battalions that fought as a distinct unit within the Canadian Corps.\n* The 87th Battalion was one of only 3 Canadian units authorized by the Minister of Militia, Sir Sam Hughes, to recruit across all of Canada. The other 2 were the [[Royal Canadian Regiment]] and [[Princess Patricia's Canadian Light Infantry]].\n* The 87th Battalion was the only Canadian Foot Guards CEF unit active during The Great War. The Governor Generals Foot Guards (GGFG) contributed volunteers for the 2nd Battalion (Eastern Ontario Regiment), CEF, and the 77th Battalion CEF (Ottawa), CEF. The Governor Generals Horse Guards (GGHG) contributed men for the 4th and 7th Canadian Mounted Rifles (Bantams) CEF, but these were composite or regional units (more on that later) and none bore the title or accoutrements of Guards.\n* Title of 'Guardsman' was awarded by [[King George V]] in 1919 as a permanent distinction in conjunction with all other Guards units, in recognition of their collective contributions to victory in the Great War.\n* 87th Battalion were the first to liberate Belgium on 5 November, 1918. Patrols from the 87th Battalion (Canadian Grenadier Guards), of the 4th Division, crossed the River Aunelle, thereby marking the liberation, by the Canadians, of the first part of occupied Belgium.\n\n== Unit milestones ==\n=== Mobilization and England ===\nThe 87th Battalion departed Canada after boarding R.M.S. [[RMS Empress of Britain (1905)|''Empress of Britain'']] on April 23, 1916 and arrived in Liverpool, England on May 5, 1916. The battalion arrived and billeted on May 27 at Bramshott Military Camp as part of the 12th Infantry Brigade (until June 1916) and then designated as part of the 11th Infantry Brigade of the 4th Canadian Infantry Division in August of the same year. During the period in England, the battalion received training from an officer and four drill sergeants from the British Grenadier Guards, all trench veterans, all previously wounded in action (WIA). On August 11/12, the battalion crossed over to France and landed at Le Havre, France on August 13, 1916 with a total strength of 1,090 all ranks. The battalion served the duration of the war as part of the 11th Infantry Brigade, 4th Canadian Infantry Division.\n\n=== First Actions & casualties ===\nFollowing the [[Battle of Mont Sorrel]], 303 members of the 87th Battalion were detached to reinforce the [[1st Battalion (Ontario Regiment), CEF]]. Of these CGG members, two, 177281 Private John Leitch, (later KIA 9 April, 1917), and 178218 Private William Anson Ogilvie, would distinguish themselves with the 1st Battalion during the Battle of the Somme and win multiple Military Medals for bravery in the field. The initial loss of men were replaced by 391 officers & men from the 77th, Battalion, (Ottawa) CEF, from the GGFG. The battalion was introduced and indoctrinated into trench warfare beginning August 18, 1916 in the Ypres area. Their first casualties, two wounded, occurred that same day. The first 87th Battalion fatality occurred on August 26, 1916. Total casualties for the first weeks of the war were eventually 17 KIA / 25 WIA. On September 16, 1916, the 87th battalion participated in their first trench raid resulting in 36 casualties out of 60 engaged unit members.\n\n===  Battle of the Somme ===\nOn 10 October, 1916, the 87th Battalion was relocated to Albert area along the Ancre area and on the 21 October, attacked and took a section of Regina Trench. The first gallantry awards earned by the 87th Battalion were awarded to four members for the attack on Regina Trench, CSM W. Blaney, Sgt. J.C. Noon, Ptes J.E. Blaney, and J.D. Hunter. After some routine activities and tours along the front, on November 18, the 87th Battalion was assigned to capture a section of Desire Trench, as well as its support systems. The attack was launched from Regina Trench. It succeeded well beyond expectations, and in addition to capturing Desire, Major Franklin Hall, with 41 volunteers, with only their rifles, bayonets, grenades and 2 Lewis Guns advanced a further 500 yards and captured part of Grandcourt Trench, including taking 115 prisoners. 80 of these were taken unaided by four privates; Roy, Thompson, Garneau and Winke.  \n[[File:Plan of Attack Vimy Ridge.jpg|thumb|87th Battalion was to advance as part of the 11th Brigage, 4th Division. (2nd from top) Plan of Attack for Vimy Ridge 9 April 1917]]\n\n=== Battle of Vimy Ridge ===\nThe Battle of Vimy Ridge was a terrible tragedy for the battalion. Progress on the right was slow because, for a time and in part, the centre had practically collapsed.The 87th Battalion (Canadian Grenadier Guards) were in the first wave but for some reason, a section of enemy trench barely a hundred metres in front of them had been left untouched by the artillery bombardment. (it has been suggested that the 87th Battalion commanding officer, Major Harold Leroy Shaw wanted to use it as a first-aid station and battalion headquarters later on.) Subsequently,the company assaulting it was virtually wiped out in just six minutes, and \u2018sixty per cent of its strength lay dead on the ground.\u2019It was not a good beginning, delaying the other guardsmen so that they lost the barrage, and those who tried to continue the advance were cut down by German machine gunners firing from positions of relative safety in the untouched trenches.   \n\nThe 87th Battalion War diaries reports that six of the seven officers leading the 87th into battle were killed or wounded within the first hours. \"Word had been received that Captain Harry Sare, (Officer Commanding the Assault), had been shot through the head with a bullet and could no longer carry on. Lieutenant Yonkles had also been hit in the left arm, Majors Joy and Ross and Lieut. Savage had been killed, and Lieut. Sinclair badly wounded, leaving Lieutenant Hannaford the only available officer of those who went over.\" The 87th diary names 11 officers killed or wounded and notes 110 other ranks killed, 157 wounded and 25 missing.    \n\n==Officers Commanding==\n*Lieut.-Col.
