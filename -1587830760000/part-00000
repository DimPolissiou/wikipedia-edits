Duke and LeBlanc were sworn in separately.\n\nColleague [[Ron Gomez]] of Lafayette stated that Duke, as a short-term legislator, was \"so single minded, he never really became involved in the nuts and bolts of House rules and parliamentary procedure.

Before he had even reached his desk and re-focused on the proceedings, another first-term member had been recognized for the floor and immediately moved to table the bill. The House voted for the motions effectively killing the bill. That and similar procedures were used against him many times.<ref>Ron Gomez, p. 230</ref> </blockquote>Gomez said that he recalls Duke obtaining the passage of only a single bill, legislation which prohibited movie producers or book publishers from compensating jurors for accounts of their court experiences.<ref>Gomez, ''Recovering Legislator'', pgs. 231-2</ref>\n\nGomez added that Duke's \"tenure in the House was short and uninspired. Never has anyone parlayed an election by such a narrow margin to such a minor position to such international prominence. He has run for numerous other positions without success but has always had some effect, usually negative, on the outcome.\"<ref>Gomez, ''Recovering Legislator'', pg. 231</ref>\n\nGomez continued: <blockquote>[Duke's] new message was that he had left the Klan, shed the Nazi uniform he had proudly worn in many previous appearances, and only wanted to serve the people. He eliminated his high-octane anti-Semitic rhetoric. He was particularly concerned with the plight of \"European-Americans.\" He never blatantly spoke of race as a factor but referred to the \"growing underclass.\" He used the tried and true demagoguery of [[class envy]] to sell his message: excessive taxpayers' money spent on welfare, school busing practices, [[affirmative action]]... and set-aside programs.

He was also fined US$10,000 and ordered to cooperate with the [[Internal Revenue Service]] (IRS) and to pay money still owed for his 1998 taxes. Following his release in May 2004, he stated that his decision to take the plea bargain was motivated by the bias that he perceived in the [[United States federal courts|United States federal court system]] and not his guilt. He said he felt the charges were contrived to derail his political career and discredit him to his followers, and that he took the safe route by pleading guilty and receiving a mitigated sentence rather than pleading not guilty and potentially receiving the full sentence.\n\nThe mail fraud charges stemmed from what prosecutors described as a six-year scheme to dupe thousands of his followers by asking for donations. Using the postal service, Duke appealed to his supporters for funds by fraudulently stating he was about to lose his house and his life savings. Prosecutors alleged that Duke raised hundreds of thousands of dollars in this scheme.

He eliminated his high-octane anti-Semitic rhetoric. He was particularly concerned with the plight of \"European-Americans.\" He never blatantly spoke of race as a factor but referred to the \"growing underclass.\" He used the tried and true demagoguery of [[class envy]] to sell his message: excessive taxpayers' money spent on welfare, school busing practices, [[affirmative action]]... and set-aside programs.

He was also fined US$10,000 and ordered to cooperate with the [[Internal Revenue Service]] (IRS) and to pay money still owed for his 1998 taxes. Following his release in May 2004, he stated that his decision to take the plea bargain was motivated by the bias that he perceived in the [[United States federal courts|United States federal court system]] and not his guilt. He said he felt the charges were contrived to derail his political career and discredit him to his followers, and that he took the safe route by pleading guilty and receiving a mitigated sentence rather than pleading not guilty and potentially receiving the full sentence.\n\nThe mail fraud charges stemmed from what prosecutors described as a six-year scheme to dupe thousands of his followers by asking for donations. Using the postal service, Duke appealed to his supporters for funds by fraudulently stating he was about to lose his house and his life savings. Prosecutors alleged that Duke raised hundreds of thousands of dollars in this scheme. Prosecutors also stipulated that in contrast to what he stated in the mailings, he sold his home at a hefty profit, had multiple investment accounts, and spent much of his money gambling at casinos.<ref name=\"foxnews.com\"/><ref>[http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2002/12/18/national/main533483.shtml Ex-Klan Leader David Duke Indicted] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121102141505/http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2002/12/18/national/main533483.shtml |date=2012-11-02 }} CBS News</ref><ref>[http://archives.cnn.com/2002/LAW/12/18/duke.plea/index.html Duke pleads guilty to fraud, false tax claims] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071114175833/http://archives.cnn.com/2002/LAW/12/18/duke.plea/index.html |date=November 14, 2007 }} CNN</ref>\n\n[[The Smoking Gun]] posted the entire file of court documents related to this case at its website, including details on Duke's guilty pleas.<ref>[http://www.thesmokinggun.com/documents/crime/david-duke-pleads-federal-charges David Duke Pleads To Federal Charges] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181024230906/http://www.thesmokinggun.com/documents/crime/david-duke-pleads-federal-charges |date=2018-10-24 }} Bill of Information for Mail Fraud and False Statements on an Income Tax Return</ref>\n\n=== 2009 arrest in the Czech Republic ===\n[[File:David Duke (Belgium 2008).png|thumb|Duke in Belgium in 2008]]\nIn April 2009, Duke traveled to the Czech Republic on invitation by a Czech [[Neo Nazism|neo-Nazi]] group known as ''N\u00e1rodn\u00ed Odpor'' (\"National Resistance\") to deliver three lectures in [[Prague]] and [[Brno]] to promote the Czech translation of his book ''My Awakening''.<ref name=\"Edelwei\u00df f\u00fcr den Grand Wizard\">[http://jungle-world.com/artikel/2009/22/35175.html Edelwei\u00df f\u00fcr den Grand Wizard] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304031434/http://jungle-world.com/artikel/2009/22/35175.html |date=2016-03-04 }}, [[Jungle World]], Nr. 22, 28.

They are often characterized as \"Lords of the Plains\" and they presided over a large area called [[Comancheria]], which came to include large portions of present-day Texas, Colorado, New Mexico, Oklahoma and Kansas.\n\nComanche power depended on [[bison]], [[horse]]s, trading, and raiding. The Comanche hunted the bison of the Great Plains for food and skins; their adoption of the horse from Spanish colonists in New Mexico made them more mobile; they traded with the [[Spanish colonization of the Americas | Spanish]], [[French colonization of the Americas | French]], Americans and neighboring Native-American peoples; and (most famously) they waged war on and raided European settlements as well as other Native Americans.<ref>Fowles, Severin, Arterberry, Lindsay Montgomery, Atherton, Heather (2017), \"Comanche New Mexico: The Eighteenth Century,\" in ''New Mexico and the Pimeria Alta'', Boulder: University Press of Colorado, pp. 158-160.

(16 February 2009)</ref>\n\n==History==\n{{Main|Comanche history}}\n\n===Formation===\nThe Proto-Comanche movement to the Plains was part of the larger phenomenon known as the \u201cShoshonean Expansion\u201d in which that language family spread across the Great Basin and across the mountains into Wyoming. The Kotsoteka (\u2018Buffalo Eaters\u2019) were probably  among the first. Other groups followed. Contact with the Shoshones of Wyoming was maintained until the 1830s when it was broken by the advancing Cheyennes and Arapahoes. \n\nAfter the Pueblo Revolt of 1680, various Plains peoples acquired horses, but probably never had very many for quite some time.\nAs late as 1725, Comanches were described as using large dogs rather than horses to carry their buffalo hide \"campaign tents.\" <ref> Kavanagh 66</ref>\n\nThe horse was a key element in the emergence of a distinctive Comanche culture. It was of such strategic importance that some scholars suggested that the Comanche broke away from the Shoshone and moved southward to search for additional sources of horses among the settlers of [[New Spain]] to the south (rather than search for new herds of buffalo.) The Comanche have the longest documented existence as horse-mounted Plains peoples; they had horses when the Cheyennes still lived in earth lodges. <ref>Kavanagh 7</ref> \n\nThe Comanche supplied horses and mules to all comers. As early as 1795, Comanches were selling horses to Anglo-American traders <ref> Kavanagh 63</ref> and by the mid-19th century, Comanche supplied horses were flowing into St. Louis via other Indian middlemen (Seminole, Osage, Shawnee) <ref> Kavanagh 380</ref>.\n\nTheir original [[Human migration|migration]] took them to the southern [[Great Plains]], into a sweep of territory extending from the [[Arkansas River]] to central Texas. The earliest references to them in the Spanish records date from 1706, when reports reached Santa Fe that Utes and Comanches were about to attack <ref>Kavanagh 63</ref>. In the Comanche advance, the Apaches were driven off the Plains. By the end of the eighteenth century the struggle between Comanches and Apaches had assumed legendary proportions: in 1784, in recounting the history of the southern Plains, Texas governor Domingo Cabello recorded that some sixty years earlier (i.e., ca. 1724) the Apaches had been routed from the southern Plains in a nine-day battle at El Gran Cierra del Fierro \u2018The Great Mountain of Iron\u2019, somewhere northwest of Texas. There is, however, no other record, documentary or legendary, of such a fight <ref> Kavanagh 66</ref>.\n\nThey were formidable opponents who developed strategies for using traditional weapons for fighting on horseback. Warfare was a major part of Comanche life. Comanche raids into Mexico traditionally took place during the full moon, when the Comanche could see to ride at night. This led to the term \"Comanche Moon\", during which the Comanche raided for horses, captives, and weapons.<ref>Wallace and Hoebel</ref> The majority of Comanche raids into Mexico were in the state of [[Chihuahua (state)|Chihuahua]] and neighboring northern states.<ref>Kavanagh (1996)</ref> {{Main|Comanche-Mexico War}}\n\n===Divisions===\nKavanagh has defined four levels of social-political integration in traditional pre-reservation Comanche society:<ref>Kavanagh 41\u201353</ref>\n*[[Patrilineal]] and [[patrilocal]] nuclear family\n*Extended family group (n\u0289m\u0289nahkahni \u2013 \"the people who live together in a household\", no size limits, but kinship recognition was limited to relatives two generations above or three below)\n*Residential local group or 'band', comprised one or more n\u0289m\u0289nahkahni, one of which formed its core. The [[Band society|band]] was the primary social unit of the Comanche. A typical band might number several hundred people. It was a family group, centered around a group of men, all of whom were relatives, sons, brothers or cousins. Since marriage with a known relative was forbidden, wives came from another group, and sisters left to join their husbands. The central man in that group was their grandfather, father, or uncle. He was called 'paraivo', 'chief'. After his death, one of the other men took his place; if none were available, the band members might  drift apart to other groups where they might have relatives and/or establish new relations by marrying an existing member. There was no separate term for or status of 'peace chief' or 'war chief'; any man leading a war party was a 'war chief'. \n\n*Division (sometimes called tribe, Spanish ''naci\u00f3n'', ''rama'' \u2013 \"branch\", comprising several local groups linked by kinship, sodalities (political, medicine, and military) and common interest in hunting, gathering, war, peace, trade). \n\nIn contrast to the neighboring [[Cheyenne]] and [[Arapaho]] to the north, there was never a single Comanche political unit recognized by all Comanches. or \"Nation.\" Rather the divisions, the most \"tribe-like\" units, acted independently, pursuing their own economic and political goals. \n\nMany Anglo-American writers have used geographical terms to label Comanche, Eastern, Western; Northern, Middle, Southern. However, these terms generally do not correspond to the Native language terms.\n\nBefore the 1750s, the three Comanche divisions were: Yamparikas, Jupes, and Kotsotekas. \n\n[[File:Comanche Osage fight.jpg|thumb|right|War on the plains: Comanche (right) trying to lance an Osage warrior. Painting by [[George Catlin]], 1834]]\nOver time, these divisions were altered in various ways, pimarily due to changes in political resources <ref> Kavanagh 478</ref>. As noted above, the Kotsotekas were proabablythe first proto-Comanche group to separate from the Eastern Shoshones.  \nIn the 1750s and 1760s, a number of Kotsoteka bands split off and moved to the southeast; the western Kotsoteka lived in the region of the upper [[Arkansas River|Arkansas]], [[Canadian River|Canadian]], and [[Red River of the South|Red]] Rivers, and the [[Llano Estacado]]. The eastern Kotsotekas lived on the [[Edwards Plateau]] and the Texas plains of the upper [[Brazos River|Brazos]] and [[Colorado River (Texas)|Colorado]] Rivers, and east to the [[Cross Timbers]].\nThey were probably the ancestors of the Penateka, (Penat\u0289ka N\u0289\u0289)<ref>{{cite web |url=http://atlas.thc.state.tx.us/viewform.asp?atlas_num=5507016257&site_name=Penateka%20Comanches&class=5000 |title=Penateka Comanches ~ Marker Number: 16257 |date=2009 |location=[[Camp Verde, Texas]] |website=[[Texas Historic Sites Atlas]] |publisher=[[Texas Historical Commission]]}}</ref>\n\nThe name Jupes vanished from history in the early 19th century, probably merging into the other divisions. Many Yamparikas moved southeast, joining the eastern Comanche and becoming known as the Tenewa. Many [[Kiowa]] and [[Plains Apache]] (or Naishan) moved to northern Comancheria and became closely associated with the Yamparika. \n\nIn the mid 19th century, other divisions arose, such as the Nokonis ('wanderers', literally 'go someplace and return'),\nand the Kwahadi ('Antelopes').\n\nThe northernmost Comanche division was the Yamparikas (Yapar\u0289hka or Yapai N\u0289\u0289 \u2014 \u2018(Yap)Root-Eaters\u2019). As the last band to move onto the Plains, they retained much of their Shoshone tradition. \n\nThere has been, and continues to be, much confusion in the presentation of Comanche group names. Groups on all levels of organization, families, n\u0289m\u0289nahkahni, bands, and divisions, were given names, but many 'band lists' do not distinguish these levels. In addition, there could be alternate names and nicknames. The spelling differences between Spanish and English add to the confusion.\n\n\n{{anchor|Bands}}\n\n===Some of the Comanche group names ===\n\n*'''Yapar\u0289hka''' or '''Yamparika''' (also ''Yapai N\u0289\u0289'' \u2014 \u2018[[Perideridia gairdneri|(Yap)Root-Eaters]]\u2019; One of its local groups  may have been called ''Widy\u0289 N\u0289\u0289 / Widy\u0289 / Widy\u0289 Yapa'' \u2014 \u2018Awl People\u2019; after the death of a man name 'Awl' they changed their name to ''T\u0289tsahk\u0289nan\u0289\u0289'' or ''Ditsahkanah'' \u2014 \u2018Sewing People\u2019.

These were both expeditionary, as with the [[Comanche-Mexico Wars|raids into Mexico]], and [[Texas-Indian Wars|defensive]] in nature. The Comanche were noted for being fierce warriors who fought vigorously to defend their homeland of [[Comancheria]]. However, the massive population of the settlers from the east and the diseases they brought with them led to mounting pressure and subsequent decline of the Comanche power and the [[wikt:Cessation|cessation]] of their major presence in the southern [[Great Plains]].\n\n===Relationship with settlers===\n[[File:Comanche Lookout Arthur T.

The Comanche were valued as trading partners since 1786 via the [[Comanchero]]s of New Mexico, but were feared for their raids against settlers in Texas.<ref>Plummer, R., Narrative of the Capture and Subsequent Sufferings of Mrs. Rachel Plummer, 1839, in Parker's Narrative and History of Texas, Louisville: Morning Courier, 1844, pp. 88-118</ref><ref>Lee, N., Three Years Among the Comanches, in Captured by the Indians, Drimmer, F., editor, New York: Dover Publications, Inc., 1961, {{ISBN|0486249018}}, pp. 277-313</ref><ref>Babb, T.A., In the Bosom of the Comanches, 1912, Dallas: John F.

At one point, [[Sam Houston]], president of the newly created [[Republic of Texas]], almost succeeded in reaching a [[peace treaty]] with the Comanche in the 1844 [[Treaty of Tehuacana Creek]]. His efforts were thwarted in 1845 when the [[Texas legislature]] refused to create an official boundary between Texas and the Comancheria.\n\nWhile the Comanche managed to maintain their independence and increase their territory, by the mid-19th century, they faced annihilation because of a wave of epidemics due to [[Eurasia]]n diseases to which they had no immunity, such as smallpox and [[measles]]. Outbreaks of [[smallpox]] (1817, 1848) and [[cholera]] (1849)<ref>Gwynne, S.C., Empire of the Summer Moon, 2010, New York: Scribner, {{ISBN|9781416591054}}, p. 112</ref> took a major toll on the Comanche, whose population dropped from an estimated 20,000 in midcentury to just a few thousand by the 1870s.\n\nThe US began efforts in the late 1860s to move the Comanche into reservations, with the [[Treaty of Medicine Lodge]] (1867), which offered churches, schools, and annuities in return for a vast tract of land totaling over {{convert|60,000|sqmi|km2}}. The government promised to stop the buffalo hunters, who were decimating the great herds of the Plains, provided that the Comanche, along with the [[Apache Tribe|Apache]]s, [[Kiowa]]s, [[Cheyenne]], and [[Arapaho]]s, move to a reservation totaling less than {{convert|5,000|sqmi|km2}} of land. However, the government did not prevent the slaughtering of the herds. The Comanche under Quenatosavit [[White Eagle, later called [[Isa-tai]] (Coyote's Vagina)] retaliated by attacking a group of hunters in the Texas Panhandle in the [[Second Battle of Adobe Walls]] (1874). The attack was a disaster for the Comanche, and the US army was called in during the [[Red River War]] to drive the remaining Comanche in the area into the reservation, culminating in the [[Battle of Palo Duro Canyon]]. Within just 10 years, the buffalo were on the verge of extinction, effectively ending the Comanche way of life as hunters. In May 1875, the last free band of Comanches, led by the Quahada warrior [[Quanah Parker]], surrendered and moved to the [[Fort Sill]] reservation in Oklahoma. The last independent Kiowa and Kiowa Apache had also surrendered.\n\nThe 1890 Census showed 1,598 Comanche at the Fort Sill reservation, which they shared with 1,140 Kiowa and 326 Kiowa Apache.<ref>[http://www.texasbeyondhistory.net/forts/indians.html Texas Beyond History \u2013 The Passing of the Indian Era]</ref>\n\n====Cherokee Commission====\nThe [[s:Agreement with the Comanche, Kiowa and Apache, 1892|Agreement with the Comanche, Kiowa and Apache]] signed with the [[Cherokee Commission]] October 6\u201321, 1892,<ref>{{cite book|last=Deloria Jr.|first=Vine J|title=Documents of American Indian Diplomacy Treaties, Agreements, and Conventions, 1775\u20131979|year=1999|publisher=University of Oklahoma Press|isbn=978-0-8061-3118-4|pages=355, 356, 357, 358|author2=DeMaille, Raymond J}}</ref> further reduced their reservation to {{convert|480,000|acre|km2}} at a cost of $1.25 per acre ($308.88/km<sup>2</sup>), with an allotment of {{convert|160|acre|km2}} per person per tribe to be held in trust. New allotments were made in 1906 to all children born after the agreement, and the remaining land was opened to white settlement. With this new arrangement, the era of the Comanche reservation came to an abrupt end.\n\n====Meusebach\u2013Comanche treaty====\nThe Peneteka band agreed to a peace treaty with the German Immigration Company under [[John O. Meusebach]]. This treaty was not affiliated with any level of government. Meusebach brokered the treaty to settle the lands on the Fisher-Miller Land Grant, from which were formed the 10 counties of [[Concho County, Texas|Concho]], [[Kimble County, Texas|Kimble]], [[Llano County, Texas|Llano]], [[Mason County, Texas|Mason]], [[McCulloch County, Texas|McCulloch]], [[Menard County, Texas|Menard]], [[Schleicher County, Texas|Schleicher]], [[San Saba County, Texas|San Saba]], [[Sutton County, Texas|Sutton]], and [[Tom Green County, Texas|Tom Green]].<ref name=\"Land\">{{cite web|title=THC-Fisher-Miller Land Grant|url=http://atlas.thc.state.tx.us/viewform.asp?atlas_num=5299009438&site_name=Fisher+-+Miller+Grant&class=5000|work=Texas Historic Markers|publisher=Texas Historical Commission|accessdate=16 September 2011}}</ref>{{details|Fisher\u2013Miller Land Grant}} In contrast to many treaties of its day, this treaty was very brief and simple, with all parties agreeing to a mutual cooperation and a sharing of the land.

The treaty was very specifically between the Peneteka band and the German Immigration Company. No other band or tribe was involved.

Many tribal members were defrauded of whatever remained of their land and possessions. Appointed paramount chief by the United States government, Chief [[Quanah Parker]] campaigned vigorously for better deals for his people, meeting with Washington politicians frequently; and helped manage land for the tribe. Parker became wealthy as a cattleman. Parker also campaigned for the Comanches' permission to practice the [[Native American Church]] religious rites, such as the usage of [[peyote]], which was condemned by European Americans.<ref>{{cite book|last=Leahy|first=Todd|title=The A to Z of Native American Movements|year=2009|publisher=Scarecrow Press|isbn=978-0-8108-6892-2|author2=Wilson, Raymond|page=120}}</ref>\n\nBefore the first Oklahoma legislature, Quanah testified:\n<blockquote>I do not think this legislature should interfere with a man's religion, also these people should be allowed to retain this health restorer.

About half of the Comanche population still lives in Oklahoma, centered on the town of Lawton.\n\nRecently, an 80-minute 1920 silent film was \"rediscovered\", titled ''[[The Daughter of Dawn]].''

One or more of the older women assisted as [[Midwifery|midwives]]. Men were not allowed inside the tipi during or immediately after the delivery.<ref>Wallace and Hoebel (1952) p.142</ref>\n\nFirst, the midwives softened the [[earthen floor]] of the tipi and dug two holes. One of the holes was for heating water and the other for the [[Placenta|afterbirth]]. One or two stakes were driven into the ground near the expectant mother's bedding for her to grip during the pain of labor. After the birth, the midwives hung the [[umbilical cord]] on a [[Celtis|hackberry]] tree. The people believed that if the umbilical cord was not disturbed before it rotted, the baby would live a long and prosperous life.<ref>Wallace and Hoebel (1952) pp.143, 144</ref>\n\nThe newborn was [[Swaddling|swaddled]] and remained with its mother in the tipi for a few days. The baby was placed in a [[cradleboard]], and the mother went back to work. She could easily carry the cradleboard on her back, or prop it against a tree where the baby could watch her while she collected seeds or roots. Cradleboards consisted of a flat board to which a basket was attached. The latter was made from rawhide straps, or a leather sheath that laced up the front. With soft, dry moss as a diaper, the young one was safely tucked into the leather pocket. During cold weather, the baby was wrapped in blankets, and then placed in the cradleboard. The baby remained in the cradleboard for about ten months; then it was allowed to crawl around.<ref name=\"Wallace and Hoebel 1952 p.120\">Wallace and Hoebel (1952) p.120</ref>\n\nBoth girls and boys were welcomed into the band, but boys were favored. If the baby was a boy, one of the midwives informed the father or grandfather, \"It's your close friend\". Families might paint a flap on the tipi to tell the rest of the tribe that they had been strengthened with another warrior. Sometimes a man named his child, but mostly the father asked a [[medicine man]] (or another man of distinction) to do so. He did this in the hope of his child living a long and productive life. During the public naming ceremony, the medicine man lit his pipe and offered smoke to the heavens, earth, and each of the four directions. He prayed that the child would remain happy and healthy. He then lifted the child to symbolize its growing up and announced the child's name four times. He held the child a little higher each time he said the name. It was believed that the child's name foretold its future; even a weak or sick child could grow up to be a great warrior, hunter, and raider if given a name suggesting courage and strength.<ref name=\"Wallace and Hoebel 1952 p.120\"/> Boys were often named after their grandfather, uncle, or other relative. Girls were usually named after one of their father's relatives, but the name was selected by the mother. As children grew up they also acquired nicknames at different points in their lives, to express some aspect of their lives.<ref>Wallace and Hoebel (1952) pp.122, 123</ref>\n\n===Children===\n\nThe Comanche looked on their children as their most precious gift. Children were rarely punished.<ref>Wallace and Hoebel (1952) p.124</ref> Sometimes, though, an older sister or other relative was called upon to discipline a child, or the parents arranged for a [[boogey man]] to scare the child. Occasionally, old people donned sheets and frightened disobedient boys and girls. Children were also told about Big Maneater Owl (''Pia Mupitsi''), who lived in a cave on the south side of the [[Wichita Mountains]] and ate bad children at night.<ref>{{cite book|last=De Capua|first=Sarah|title=The Comanche|year=2006|publisher=Benchmark Books|isbn=978-0-7614-2249-5|pages=22, 23}}</ref>\n\nChildren learned from example, by observing and listening to their parents and others in the band. As soon as she was old enough to walk, a girl followed her mother about the camp and played at the daily tasks of cooking and making clothing. She was also very close to her mother's sisters, who were called not aunt but ''pia'', meaning mother. She was given a little deerskin doll, which she took with her everywhere. She learned to make all the clothing for the doll.<ref name=\"WH124125\"/>\n\nA boy identified not only with his father but with his father's family, as well as with the bravest warriors in the band. He learned to ride a horse before he could walk. By the time he was four or five, he was expected to be able to skillfully handle a horse. When he was five or six, he was given a small [[Bow (weapon)|bow]] and [[arrow (weapon)|arrow]]s. Often, a boy was taught to ride and shoot by his grandfather, since his father and other warriors were on raids and hunts. His grandfather also taught him about his own boyhood and the history and legends of the Comanche.<ref name=\"WH125-132\"/>\n\n[[File:Comanchechild.jpg|thumb|upright|A 19th-century Comanche child.]]\nAs the boy grew older, he joined the other boys to hunt birds. He eventually ranged farther from camp looking for better game to kill. Encouraged to be skillful hunters, boys learned the signs of the [[prairie]] as they learned to patiently and quietly stalk game. They became more self-reliant, yet, by playing together as a group, also formed the strong bonds and cooperative spirit that they would need when they hunted and raided.<ref name=\"WH125-132\"/>\n[[File:Comanches.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Comanches of West [[Texas]] in war regalia, c. 1830.]]\n\nBoys were highly respected because they would become warriors and might die young in battle. As he approached manhood, a boy went on his first buffalo hunt. If he made a kill, his father honored him with a feast. Only after he had proven himself on a buffalo hunt was a young man allowed to go to war.<ref name=\"WH125-132\"/>\n\nWhen he was ready to become a warrior, at about age fifteen or sixteen, a young man first \"made his medicine\" by going on a [[vision quest]] (a [[rite of passage]]). Following this quest, his father gave the young man a good horse to ride into battle and another mount for the trail. If he had proved himself as a warrior, a Give Away Dance might be held in his honor. As drummers faced east, the honored boy and other young men danced. His parents, along with his other relatives and the people in the band, threw presents at his feet \u2013 especially blankets and horses symbolized by sticks. Anyone might snatch one of the gifts for themselves, although those with many possessions refrained; they did not want to appear greedy. People often gave away all their belongings during these dances, providing for others in the band, but leaving themselves with nothing.<ref name=\"WH125-132\">Wallace and Hoebel (1952) pp.126\u2013132</ref>\n\nGirls learned to gather healthy berries, nuts, and roots. They carried water and collected wood, and when about twelve years old learned to cook meals, make tipis, sew clothing, prepare hides, and perform other tasks essential to becoming a wife and mother. They were then considered ready to be married.<ref name=\"WH124125\">Wallace and Hoebel (1952) pp.124, 125</ref>\n\n===Death===\nDuring the 19th century, the traditional Comanche burial custom was to wrap the deceased's body in a blanket and place it on a horse, behind a rider, who would then ride in search of an appropriate burial place, such as a secure cave. After entombment, the rider covered the body with stones and returned to camp, where the mourners burned all the deceased's possessions. The primary mourner slashed his arms to express his grief. The Quahada band followed this custom longer than other bands and buried their relatives in the [[Wichita Mountains]]. Christian missionaries persuaded Comanche people to bury their dead in coffins in graveyards,<ref>Kroeker</ref> which is the practice today.\n\n===Transportation and habitation===\n[[File:Catlin -- Comanche warrior and tipi.jpg|thumb|left|Comanche Tipis painted by [[George Catlin]].]]\n[[File:Ako, a Comanche warrior and horse -.jpg|thumb|Comanche warrior ''Ako'' and horse.

Photo by James Mooney, 1892.]]\nWhen they lived with the Shoshone, the Comanche mainly used dog-drawn [[travois]] for transportation. Later, they acquired horses from other tribes, such as the Pueblo, and from the Spaniards. Since horses are faster, easier to control and able to carry more, this helped with their hunting and warfare and made moving camp easier. Larger dwellings were made due to the ability to pull and carry more belongings. Being herbivores, horses were also easier to feed than dogs, since meat was a valuable resource.<ref>Rollings, Deer (2004) pp 20\u201324</ref> The horse was of the utmost value to the Comanche. A Comanche man's wealth was measured by the size of his horse herd. Horses were prime targets to steal during raids; often raids were conducted specifically to capture horses. Often horse herds numbering in the hundreds were stolen by Comanche during raids against other Indian nations, Spanish, Mexicans, and later from the ranches of Texans. Horses were used for warfare with the Comanche being considered to be among the finest light cavalry and mounted warriors in history.<ref>{{cite web|title=Indian Culture and the Horse|url=http://paulrittman.com/Indian%20Culture%20and%20the%20Horse.pdf|accessdate=2013-05-26}}</ref>\n[[File:Comanche Feats of Horsemanship-George Catlin.jpg|thumb|left|''Comanche Feats of Horsemenship'', [[George Catlin]] 1834.]]\n\nThe Comanche sheathed their tipis with a covering made of buffalo hides sewn together. To prepare the buffalo hides, women first spread them on the ground, then scraped away the fat and flesh with blades made from bones or antlers, and left them in the sun. When the hides were dry, they scraped off the thick hair, and then soaked them in water. After several days, they vigorously rubbed the hides in a mixture of animal fat, brains, and liver to soften the hides. The hides were made even more supple by further rinsing and working back and forth over a rawhide thong. Finally, they were smoked over a fire, which gave the hides a light tan color. To finish the tipi covering, women laid the tanned hides side by side and stitched them together. As many as 22 hides could be used, but 14 was the average. When finished, the hide covering was tied to a pole and raised, wrapped around the cone-shaped frame, and pinned together with pencil-sized wooden skewers. Two wing-shaped flaps at the top of the tipi were turned back to make an opening, which could be adjusted to keep out the moisture and held pockets of insulating air. With a fire pit in the center of the earthen floor, the tipis stayed warm in the winter. In the summer, the bottom edges of the tipis could be rolled up to let cool breezes in. Cooking was done outside during the hot weather. Tipis were very practical homes for itinerant people. Working together, women could quickly set them up or take them down. An entire Comanche band could be packed and chasing a buffalo herd within about 20 minutes. The Comanche women were the ones who did the most work with food processing and preparation.<ref>Rollings, Deer (2004) pp. 29\u201330</ref>\n\n===Food===\n[[File:Comanche Indians Chasing Buffalo with Lances and Bows.jpg|thumb|Comanches chasing bison, painted by [[George Catlin]]. The bison were the primary food source for the Comanche.]]\nThe Comanche were initially [[hunter-gatherers]]. When they lived in the [[Rocky Mountains]], during their migration to the Great Plains, both men and women shared the responsibility of gathering and providing food. When the Comanche reached the plains, hunting came to predominate. Hunting was considered a male activity and was a principal source of prestige. For meat, the Comanche hunted [[Plains bison|buffalo]], [[elk]], [[American black bear|black bear]], [[pronghorn]], and [[deer]]. When game was scarce, the men hunted wild mustangs, sometimes eating their own ponies. In later years the Comanche raided Texas ranches and stole longhorn cattle. They did not eat fish or fowl, unless starving, when they would eat virtually any creature they could catch, including [[armadillo]]s, [[skunk]]s, [[rat]]s, [[lizard]]s, [[frog]]s, and [[grasshopper]]s. Buffalo meat and other game was prepared and cooked by the women. The women also gathered wild fruits, seeds, nuts, berries, roots, and tubers \u2014 including [[plum]]s, [[grape]]s, [[juniper]] berries, [[persimmon]]s, [[mulberry|mulberries]], [[acorn]]s, [[pecan]]s, wild [[onion]]s, [[radish]]es, and the fruit of the prickly [[pear cactus]]. The Comanche also acquired [[maize]], dried [[pumpkin]], and [[tobacco]] through trade and raids. Most meats were roasted over a fire or boiled. To boil fresh or dried meat and vegetables, women dug a pit in the ground, which they lined with animal skins or buffalo stomach and filled with water to make a kind of cooking pot. They placed heated stones in the water until it boiled and had cooked their stew. After they came into contact with the Spanish, the Comanche traded for copper pots and iron kettles, which made cooking easier.\n\nWomen used berries and nuts, as well as honey and [[tallow]], to flavor buffalo meat. They stored the tallow in intestine casings or rawhide pouches called ''oy\u00f3ot\u00fb\u00bf''. They especially liked to make a sweet mush of buffalo marrow mixed with crushed mesquite beans.\n\nThe Comanches sometimes ate raw meat, especially raw liver flavored with [[bile|gall]]. They also drank the milk from the slashed udders of buffalo, deer, and elk.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Indians of Texas: from prehistoric to modern times|last=Newcomb, Jr.|first=W.W.|publisher=University of Texas Press|year=2002|isbn=978-0-292-78425-3|location=|pages=[https://archive.org/details/indiansoftexasfr00newc/page/164 164]|url=https://archive.org/details/indiansoftexasfr00newc/page/164}}</ref> Among their delicacies was the curdled milk from the stomachs of suckling buffalo calves. They also enjoyed buffalo tripe, or stomachs.\n\nComanche people generally had a light meal in the morning and a large evening meal. During the day they ate whenever they were hungry or when it was convenient. Like other [[Plains Indians]], the Comanche were very hospitable people. They prepared meals whenever a visitor arrived in camp, which led to outsiders' belief that the Comanches ate at all hours of the day or night. Before calling a public event, the chief took a morsel of food, held it to the sky, and then buried it as a peace offering to the Great Spirit. Many families offered thanks as they sat down to eat their meals in their tipis.\n\nComanche children ate [[pemmican]], but this was primarily a tasty, high-energy food reserved for war parties. Carried in a parfleche pouch, pemmican was eaten only when the men did not have time to hunt. Similarly, in camp, people ate pemmican only when other food was scarce. Traders ate pemmican sliced and dipped in honey, which they called Indian bread.\n\n===Clothing===\n[[File:Feather headdress Comanche EthnM.jpg|thumb|upright|Comanche [[headdress]] at the Ethnologisches Museum, Berlin.]]\n[[File:Chosequah- Comanche Indian.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Chosequah, a Comanche warrior wearing full traditional regalia. Painted by [[Elbridge Ayer Burbank|E.A Burbank]], 1897.]]\nComanche clothing was simple and easy to wear. Men wore a leather belt with a breechcloth \u2014 a long piece of buckskin that was brought up between the legs and looped over and under the belt at the front and back, and loose-fitting deerskin leggings. [[Moccasins]] had soles made from thick, tough buffalo hide with soft deerskin uppers. The Comanche men wore nothing on the upper body except in the winter, when they wore warm, heavy robes made from buffalo hides (or occasionally, [[American black bear|bear]], [[wolf]], or [[coyote]] skins) with knee-length buffalo-hide boots. Young boys usually went without clothes except in cold weather. When they reached the age of eight or nine, they began to wear the clothing of a Comanche adult. In the 19th century, men used woven cloth to replace the buckskin breechcloths, and the men began wearing loose-fitting buckskin shirts. The women decorated their shirts, leggings and moccasins with fringes made of deer-skin, animal fur, and human hair. They also decorated their shirts and leggings with patterns and shapes formed with beads and scraps of material. Comanche women wore long deerskin dresses. The dresses had a flared skirt and wide, long sleeves, and were trimmed with buckskin fringes along the sleeves and hem. Beads and pieces of metal were attached in geometric patterns. Comanche women wore buckskin moccasins with buffalo soles. In the winter they, too, wore warm buffalo robes and tall, fur-lined buffalo-hide boots.\nUnlike the boys, young girls did not go without clothes. As soon as they were able to walk, they were dressed in breechcloths. By the age of twelve or thirteen, they adopted the clothes of Comanche women.<ref>Rollings, Deer (2004) p. 31</ref>\n\n===Hair and headgear===\nComanche people took pride in their hair, which was worn long and rarely cut. They arranged their hair with [[porcupine]] quill brushes, greased it and parted it in the center from the forehead to the back of the neck. They painted the scalp along the parting with yellow, red, or white clay (or other colors). They wore their hair in two long braids tied with leather thongs or colored cloth, and sometimes wrapped with [[beaver]] fur. They also braided a strand of hair from the top of their head. This slender braid, called a scalp lock, was decorated with colored scraps of cloth and beads, and a single feather. Comanche men rarely wore anything on their heads. Only after they moved onto a reservation late in the 19th century did Comanche men begin to wear the typical Plains [[headdress]]. If the winter was severely cold, they might wear a brimless, woolly buffalo hide hat. When they went to war, some warriors wore a headdress made from a buffalo's scalp. Warriors cut away most of the hide and flesh from a buffalo head, leaving only a portion of the woolly hair and the horns. This type of woolly, horned buffalo hat was worn only by the Comanche. Comanche women did not let their hair grow as long as the men did. Young women might wear their hair long and braided, but women parted their hair in the middle and kept it short. Like the men, they painted their scalp along the parting with bright paint.<ref>Rollings, Deer (2004) pp. 31, 32</ref>\n\n===Body decoration===\nComanche men usually had [[pierced ears]] with hanging earrings made from pieces of shell or loops of brass or silver wire. A female relative would pierce the outer edge of the ear with six or eight holes. The men also [[tattoo]]ed their face, arms, and chest with geometric designs, and painted their face and body. Traditionally they used paints made from berry juice and the colored clays of the Comancheria. Later, traders supplied them with vermilion (red pigment) and bright grease paints. Comanche men also wore bands of leather and strips of metal on their arms. Except for black, which was the color for war, there was no standard color or pattern for face and body painting: it was a matter of individual preference. For example, one Comanche might paint one side of his face white and the other side red; another might paint one side of his body green and the other side with green and black stripes. One Comanche might always paint himself in a particular way, while another might change the colors and designs when so inclined. Some designs had special meaning to the individual, and special colors and designs might have been revealed in a dream. Comanche women might also tattoo their face or arms. They were fond of painting their bodies and were free to paint themselves however they pleased. A popular pattern among the women was to paint the insides of their ears a bright red and paint great orange and red circles on their cheeks. They usually painted red and yellow around their lips.<ref>Rollings, Deer (2004) pp. 32, 33</ref> \n[[File:Comanche ration bag 1880 OHS.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Comanche beaded ration bag, c. 1880, collection of the [[Oklahoma History Center]]]]\n\n===Arts and crafts===\nBecause of their frequent traveling, Comanche Indians had to make sure that their household goods and other possessions were unbreakable. They did not use pottery that could easily be broken on long journeys. Basketry, weaving, wood carving, and metal working were also unknown among the Comanches. Instead, they depended upon the buffalo for most of their tools, household goods, and weapons. They made nearly 200 different articles from the horns, hide, and bones of the buffalo.\n\nRemoving the lining of the inner stomach, women made the paunch into a water bag. The lining was stretched over four sticks and then filled with water to make a pot for cooking soups and stews. With wood scarce on the plains, women relied on buffalo chips (dried dung) to fuel the fires that cooked meals and warmed the people through long winters.<ref>Rollings, Deer (2004) p 28</ref>\n\nStiff rawhide was fashioned into saddles, stirrups and cinches, knife cases, buckets, and moccasin soles. Rawhide was also made into rattles and drums. Strips of rawhide were twisted into sturdy ropes. Scraped to resemble white parchment, rawhide skins were folded to make parfleches in which food, clothing, and other personal belongings were kept. Women also [[Tanning (leather)|tanned hides]] to make soft and supple buckskin, which was used for tipi covers, warm robes, blankets, cloths, and moccasins. They also relied upon buckskin for bedding, cradles, dolls, bags, pouches, quivers, and gun cases.\n\n[[Sinew]] was used for bowstrings and sewing thread. Hooves were turned into glue and rattles. The horns were shaped into cups, spoons, and ladles, while the tail made a good whip, a fly-swatter, or a decoration for the tipi. Men made tools, scrapers, and needles from the bones, as well as a kind of pipe, and fashioned toys for their children. As warriors, however, men concentrated on making bows and arrows, lances, and shields. The thick neck skin of an old bull was ideal for war shields that deflected arrows as well as bullets. Since they spent most of each day on horseback, they also fashioned leather into saddles, stirrups, and other equipment for their mounts. Buffalo hair was used to fill saddle pads and was also used in rope and halters.<ref>Rollings, Deer (2004) pp 25, 26</ref>\n\n===Language===\n{{Main|Comanche language}}\n[[File:Charles Chibitty.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Charles Chibitty]], Comanche [[code talker]] in [[World War II]]]]\n\nThe language spoken by the [[Comanche people]], ''[[Comanche language|Comanche]]'' (''N<s>u</s>m<s>u</s> tekwap<u><s>u</s></u>''), is a [[Numic languages|Numic language]] of the [[Uto-Aztecan languages|Uto-Aztecan language group]]. It is closely related to the [[Shoshone language|language of the Shoshone]], from which the Comanche diverged around 1700. The two languages remain closely related, but a few low-level sound changes inhibit mutual intelligibility. The earliest records of Comanche from 1786 clearly show a dialect of Shoshone, but by the beginning of the 20th century, these sound changes had modified the way Comanche sounded in subtle, but profound, ways.<ref>McLaughlin (1992), 158-81</ref><ref>McLaughlin (2000), 293\u2013304</ref> Although efforts are now being made to ensure survival of the language, most of its speakers are elderly, and less than one percent of the Comanches can speak it.\n\nIn the late 19th century, many Comanche children were placed in boarding schools with children from different tribes. The children were taught English and discouraged from speaking their native language. Anecdotally, enforcement of speaking English was severe.\n\nQuanah Parker learned and spoke English and was adamant that his own children do the same. The second generation then grew up speaking English, because it was believed{{who|date=June 2014}} that it was better for them not to know Comanche.<ref name=\"H\u00e4m\u00e4l\u00e4inen 2008, p.171\">H\u00e4m\u00e4l\u00e4inen (2008), p.171</ref>\n\nDuring [[World War II]], a group of 17 young men, referred to as \"The Comanche [[Code talker|Code Talkers]]\", were trained and used by the [[U.S. Army]] to send messages conveying sensitive information that could not be deciphered by the Germans.<ref>{{cite book|last=Holm|first=Tom|title=Code Talkers and Warriors: Native Americans and World War II|year=2007|publisher=Chelsea House Publications|isbn=978-0-7910-9340-5|pages=[https://archive.org/details/codetalkerswarri00holm_0/page/108 108\u2013120]|chapter=The Comanche Code Talkers|chapter-url=https://archive.org/details/codetalkerswarri00holm_0/page/108}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.nbcnews.com/storyline/d-day-70th-anniversary/comanche-indians-honor-d-day-code-talkers-n126216|work=D-Day 70th Anniversary|title=Comanche Indians Honor D-Day Code-Talkers|date=June 9, 2014|publisher=NBC News }}</ref>\n\n==Notable Comanches==\n<!--Please only add people with pre-existing Wikipedia articles-->\n*[[Spirit Talker]] ([[Mukwooru]]) (c. 1780-1840), Penateka chief and medicine man \n*[[Old Owl]] ([[Mupitsukup\u0289]]) (late 1780s\u20131849), Penateka chief \n*[[Amorous Man]] (Pahayoko) (late 1780s\u2013c. 1860), Penateka chief \n*[[Ten Bears]] (Paw\u0289\u0289ras\u0289m\u0289nun\u0289) (c. 1790\u20131872), chief of the Ketahto and later of the Yamparika band\n*[[Santa Anna (Comanche war chief)|Santa Anna]] (c. 1800-c. 1849), war chief of the Penateka Band \n*[[Buffalo Hump]] (Pots\u0289nakwahip\u0289) (c. 1800-c. 1865/1870), war chief and later head chief of the Penateka Band \n*[[Iron Jacket]] (Puhihwikwasu'u) (c. 1790-1858), war chief and later head chief of the Quahadi band; father of Peta Nocona\n*[[Horseback (Comanche)|Horseback]] (T\u0289h\u0289yakwahip\u0289) (c. 1805/1810-c. 1888), chief of the Nokoni band\n*[[Tosawi]] (White Knife) (c. 1805/1810-c. 1878/1880), chief of the Penateka band\n*[[Peta Nocona]] (Lone Wanderer) (c. 1820-c. 1864), chief of the Nokoni division; father of Quanah Parker\n*[[Piaru-ekaruhkapu]] (Big Red Meat) (c. 1820/1825-1875), Nokoni chief \n*[[Isatai]] (c. 1840\u2013c. 1890), warrior and medicine man of the Quahadi band \n*[[Diane O'Leary]] (1939\u20132013), artist, nurse\n*[[Quanah Parker]] (c. 1845\u20131911), Quahadi chief, a founder of [[Native American Church]], and successful rancher\n[[File:Comanche chief.jpg|thumb|upright|Mo'o-wai (\"Pushing aside\" or \"Pushing-in-the-middle\"), aka \"Shaking Hand\", chief of the Kotsoteka]]\n*[[White Parker]] (1887\u20131956), son of Quanah Parker and Methodist missionary\n*[[Gil Birmingham]] (born 1953), actor, ''[[Into the West (TV miniseries)|Into the West]]''\n*[[Blackbear Bosin]] (1921\u20131980), Kiowa-Comanche sculptor and painter\n*[[Charles Chibitty]] (1921\u20132005), World War II Comanche code talker\n*[[Marie C.

They are often characterized as \"Lords of the Plains\" and they presided over a large area called [[Comancheria]], which came to include large portions of present-day Texas, Colorado, New Mexico, Oklahoma and Kansas.\n\nComanche power depended on [[bison]], [[horse]]s, trading, and raiding. The Comanche hunted the bison of the Great Plains for food and skins; their adoption of the horse from Spanish colonists in New Mexico made them more mobile; they traded with the [[Spanish colonization of the Americas | Spanish]], [[French colonization of the Americas | French]], Americans and neighboring Native-American peoples; and (most famously) they waged war on and raided European settlements as well as other Native Americans.<ref>Fowles, Severin, Arterberry, Lindsay Montgomery, Atherton, Heather (2017), \"Comanche New Mexico: The Eighteenth Century,\" in ''New Mexico and the Pimeria Alta'', Boulder: University Press of Colorado, pp. 158-160.

(16 February 2009)</ref>\n\n==History==\n{{Main|Comanche history}}\n\n===Formation===\nThe Proto-Comanche movement to the Plains was part of the larger phenomenon known as the \u201cShoshonean Expansion\u201d in which that language family spread across the Great Basin and across the mountains into Wyoming. The Kotsoteka (\u2018Buffalo Eaters\u2019) were probably  among the first. Other groups followed. Contact with the Shoshones of Wyoming was maintained until the 1830s when it was broken by the advancing Cheyennes and Arapahoes. \n\nAfter the Pueblo Revolt of 1680, various Plains peoples acquired horses, but probably never had very many for quite some time.\nAs late as 1725, Comanches were described as using large dogs rather than horses to carry their buffalo hide \"campaign tents.\" <ref> Kavanagh 66</ref>\n\nThe horse was a key element in the emergence of a distinctive Comanche culture. It was of such strategic importance that some scholars suggested that the Comanche broke away from the Shoshone and moved southward to search for additional sources of horses among the settlers of [[New Spain]] to the south (rather than search for new herds of buffalo.) The Comanche have the longest documented existence as horse-mounted Plains peoples; they had horses when the Cheyennes still lived in earth lodges. <ref>Kavanagh 7</ref> \n\nThe Comanche supplied horses and mules to all comers. As early as 1795, Comanches were selling horses to Anglo-American traders <ref> Kavanagh 63</ref> and by the mid-19th century, Comanche supplied horses were flowing into St. Louis via other Indian middlemen (Seminole, Osage, Shawnee) <ref> Kavanagh 380</ref>.\n\nTheir original [[Human migration|migration]] took them to the southern [[Great Plains]], into a sweep of territory extending from the [[Arkansas River]] to central Texas. The earliest references to them in the Spanish records date from 1706, when reports reached Santa Fe that Utes and Comanches were about to attack <ref>Kavanagh 63</ref>. In the Comanche advance, the Apaches were driven off the Plains. By the end of the eighteenth century the struggle between Comanches and Apaches had assumed legendary proportions: in 1784, in recounting the history of the southern Plains, Texas governor Domingo Cabello recorded that some sixty years earlier (i.e., ca. 1724) the Apaches had been routed from the southern Plains in a nine-day battle at El Gran Cierra del Fierro \u2018The Great Mountain of Iron\u2019, somewhere northwest of Texas. There is, however, no other record, documentary or legendary, of such a fight <ref> Kavanagh 66</ref>.\n\nThey were formidable opponents who developed strategies for using traditional weapons for fighting on horseback. Warfare was a major part of Comanche life. Comanche raids into Mexico traditionally took place during the full moon, when the Comanche could see to ride at night. This led to the term \"Comanche Moon\", during which the Comanche raided for horses, captives, and weapons.<ref>Wallace and Hoebel</ref> The majority of Comanche raids into Mexico were in the state of [[Chihuahua (state)|Chihuahua]] and neighboring northern states.<ref>Kavanagh (1996)</ref> {{Main|Comanche-Mexico War}}\n\n===Divisions===\nKavanagh has defined four levels of social-political integration in traditional pre-reservation Comanche society:<ref>Kavanagh 41\u201353</ref>\n*[[Patrilineal]] and [[patrilocal]] nuclear family\n*Extended family group (n\u0289m\u0289nahkahni \u2013 \"the people who live together in a household\", no size limits, but kinship recognition was limited to relatives two generations above or three below)\n*Residential local group or 'band', comprised one or more n\u0289m\u0289nahkahni, one of which formed its core. The [[Band society|band]] was the primary social unit of the Comanche. A typical band might number several hundred people. It was a family group, centered around a group of men, all of whom were relatives, sons, brothers or cousins. Since marriage with a known relative was forbidden, wives came from another group, and sisters left to join their husbands. The central man in that group was their grandfather, father, or uncle. He was called 'paraivo', 'chief'. After his death, one of the other men took his place; if none were available, the band members might  drift apart to other groups where they might have relatives and/or establish new relations by marrying an existing member. There was no separate term for or status of 'peace chief' or 'war chief'; any man leading a war party was a 'war chief'. \n\n*Division (sometimes called tribe, Spanish ''naci\u00f3n'', ''rama'' \u2013 \"branch\", comprising several local groups linked by kinship, sodalities (political, medicine, and military) and common interest in hunting, gathering, war, peace, trade). \n\nIn contrast to the neighboring [[Cheyenne]] and [[Arapaho]] to the north, there was never a single Comanche political unit recognized by all Comanches. or \"Nation.\" Rather the divisions, the most \"tribe-like\" units, acted independently, pursuing their own economic and political goals. \n\nMany Anglo-American writers have used geographical terms to label Comanche, Eastern, Western; Northern, Middle, Southern. However, these terms generally do not correspond to the Native language terms.\n\nBefore the 1750s, the three Comanche divisions were: Yamparikas, Jupes, and Kotsotekas. \n\n[[File:Comanche Osage fight.jpg|thumb|right|War on the plains: Comanche (right) trying to lance an Osage warrior. Painting by [[George Catlin]], 1834]]\nOver time, these divisions were altered in various ways, pimarily due to changes in political resources <ref> Kavanagh 478</ref>. As noted above, the Kotsotekas were proabablythe first proto-Comanche group to separate from the Eastern Shoshones.  \nIn the 1750s and 1760s, a number of Kotsoteka bands split off and moved to the southeast; the western Kotsoteka lived in the region of the upper [[Arkansas River|Arkansas]], [[Canadian River|Canadian]], and [[Red River of the South|Red]] Rivers, and the [[Llano Estacado]]. The eastern Kotsotekas lived on the [[Edwards Plateau]] and the Texas plains of the upper [[Brazos River|Brazos]] and [[Colorado River (Texas)|Colorado]] Rivers, and east to the [[Cross Timbers]].\nThey were probably the ancestors of the Penateka, (Penat\u0289ka N\u0289\u0289)<ref>{{cite web |url=http://atlas.thc.state.tx.us/viewform.asp?atlas_num=5507016257&site_name=Penateka%20Comanches&class=5000 |title=Penateka Comanches ~ Marker Number: 16257 |date=2009 |location=[[Camp Verde, Texas]] |website=[[Texas Historic Sites Atlas]] |publisher=[[Texas Historical Commission]]}}</ref>\n\nThe name Jupes vanished from history in the early 19th century, probably merging into the other divisions. Many Yamparikas moved southeast, joining the eastern Comanche and becoming known as the Tenewa. Many [[Kiowa]] and [[Plains Apache]] (or Naishan) moved to northern Comancheria and became closely associated with the Yamparika. \n\nIn the mid 19th century, other divisions arose, such as the Nokonis ('wanderers', literally 'go someplace and return'),\nand the Kwahadi ('Antelopes').\n\nThe northernmost Comanche division was the Yamparikas (Yapar\u0289hka or Yapai N\u0289\u0289 \u2014 \u2018(Yap)Root-Eaters\u2019). As the last band to move onto the Plains, they retained much of their Shoshone tradition. \n\nThere has been, and continues to be, much confusion in the presentation of Comanche group names. Groups on all levels of organization, families, n\u0289m\u0289nahkahni, bands, and divisions, were given names, but many 'band lists' do not distinguish these levels. In addition, there could be alternate names and nicknames. The spelling differences between Spanish and English add to the confusion.\n\n\n{{anchor|Bands}}\n\n===Some of the Comanche group names ===\n\n*'''Yapar\u0289hka''' or '''Yamparika''' (also ''Yapai N\u0289\u0289'' \u2014 \u2018[[Perideridia gairdneri|(Yap)Root-Eaters]]\u2019; One of its local groups  may have been called ''Widy\u0289 N\u0289\u0289 / Widy\u0289 / Widy\u0289 Yapa'' \u2014 \u2018Awl People\u2019; after the death of a man name 'Awl' they changed their name to ''T\u0289tsahk\u0289nan\u0289\u0289'' or ''Ditsahkanah'' \u2014 \u2018Sewing People\u2019.

These were both expeditionary, as with the [[Comanche-Mexico Wars|raids into Mexico]], and [[Texas-Indian Wars|defensive]] in nature. The Comanche were noted for being fierce warriors who fought vigorously to defend their homeland of [[Comancheria]]. However, the massive population of the settlers from the east and the diseases they brought with them led to mounting pressure and subsequent decline of the Comanche power and the [[wikt:Cessation|cessation]] of their major presence in the southern [[Great Plains]].\n\n===Relationship with settlers===\n[[File:Comanche Lookout Arthur T.

The Comanche were valued as trading partners since 1786 via the [[Comanchero]]s of New Mexico, but were feared for their raids against settlers in Texas.<ref>Plummer, R., Narrative of the Capture and Subsequent Sufferings of Mrs. Rachel Plummer, 1839, in Parker's Narrative and History of Texas, Louisville: Morning Courier, 1844, pp. 88-118</ref><ref>Lee, N., Three Years Among the Comanches, in Captured by the Indians, Drimmer, F., editor, New York: Dover Publications, Inc., 1961, {{ISBN|0486249018}}, pp. 277-313</ref><ref>Babb, T.A., In the Bosom of the Comanches, 1912, Dallas: John F.

At one point, [[Sam Houston]], president of the newly created [[Republic of Texas]], almost succeeded in reaching a [[peace treaty]] with the Comanche in the 1844 [[Treaty of Tehuacana Creek]]. His efforts were thwarted in 1845 when the [[Texas legislature]] refused to create an official boundary between Texas and the Comancheria.\n\nWhile the Comanche managed to maintain their independence and increase their territory, by the mid-19th century, they faced annihilation because of a wave of epidemics due to [[Eurasia]]n diseases to which they had no immunity, such as smallpox and [[measles]]. Outbreaks of [[smallpox]] (1817, 1848) and [[cholera]] (1849)<ref>Gwynne, S.C., Empire of the Summer Moon, 2010, New York: Scribner, {{ISBN|9781416591054}}, p. 112</ref> took a major toll on the Comanche, whose population dropped from an estimated 20,000 in midcentury to just a few thousand by the 1870s.\n\nThe US began efforts in the late 1860s to move the Comanche into reservations, with the [[Treaty of Medicine Lodge]] (1867), which offered churches, schools, and annuities in return for a vast tract of land totaling over {{convert|60,000|sqmi|km2}}. The government promised to stop the buffalo hunters, who were decimating the great herds of the Plains, provided that the Comanche, along with the [[Apache Tribe|Apache]]s, [[Kiowa]]s, [[Cheyenne]], and [[Arapaho]]s, move to a reservation totaling less than {{convert|5,000|sqmi|km2}} of land. However, the government did not prevent the slaughtering of the herds. The Comanche under Quenatosavit [[White Eagle, later called [[Isa-tai]] (Coyote's Vagina)] retaliated by attacking a group of hunters in the Texas Panhandle in the [[Second Battle of Adobe Walls]] (1874). The attack was a disaster for the Comanche, and the US army was called in during the [[Red River War]] to drive the remaining Comanche in the area into the reservation, culminating in the [[Battle of Palo Duro Canyon]]. Within just 10 years, the buffalo were on the verge of extinction, effectively ending the Comanche way of life as hunters. In May 1875, the last free band of Comanches, led by the Quahada warrior [[Quanah Parker]], surrendered and moved to the [[Fort Sill]] reservation in Oklahoma. The last independent Kiowa and Kiowa Apache had also surrendered.\n\nThe 1890 Census showed 1,598 Comanche at the Fort Sill reservation, which they shared with 1,140 Kiowa and 326 Kiowa Apache.<ref>[http://www.texasbeyondhistory.net/forts/indians.html Texas Beyond History \u2013 The Passing of the Indian Era]</ref>\n\n====Cherokee Commission====\nThe [[s:Agreement with the Comanche, Kiowa and Apache, 1892|Agreement with the Comanche, Kiowa and Apache]] signed with the [[Cherokee Commission]] October 6\u201321, 1892,<ref>{{cite book|last=Deloria Jr.|first=Vine J|title=Documents of American Indian Diplomacy Treaties, Agreements, and Conventions, 1775\u20131979|year=1999|publisher=University of Oklahoma Press|isbn=978-0-8061-3118-4|pages=355, 356, 357, 358|author2=DeMaille, Raymond J}}</ref> further reduced their reservation to {{convert|480,000|acre|km2}} at a cost of $1.25 per acre ($308.88/km<sup>2</sup>), with an allotment of {{convert|160|acre|km2}} per person per tribe to be held in trust. New allotments were made in 1906 to all children born after the agreement, and the remaining land was opened to white settlement. With this new arrangement, the era of the Comanche reservation came to an abrupt end.\n\n====Meusebach\u2013Comanche treaty====\nThe Peneteka band agreed to a peace treaty with the German Immigration Company under [[John O. Meusebach]]. This treaty was not affiliated with any level of government. Meusebach brokered the treaty to settle the lands on the Fisher-Miller Land Grant, from which were formed the 10 counties of [[Concho County, Texas|Concho]], [[Kimble County, Texas|Kimble]], [[Llano County, Texas|Llano]], [[Mason County, Texas|Mason]], [[McCulloch County, Texas|McCulloch]], [[Menard County, Texas|Menard]], [[Schleicher County, Texas|Schleicher]], [[San Saba County, Texas|San Saba]], [[Sutton County, Texas|Sutton]], and [[Tom Green County, Texas|Tom Green]].<ref name=\"Land\">{{cite web|title=THC-Fisher-Miller Land Grant|url=http://atlas.thc.state.tx.us/viewform.asp?atlas_num=5299009438&site_name=Fisher+-+Miller+Grant&class=5000|work=Texas Historic Markers|publisher=Texas Historical Commission|accessdate=16 September 2011}}</ref>{{details|Fisher\u2013Miller Land Grant}} In contrast to many treaties of its day, this treaty was very brief and simple, with all parties agreeing to a mutual cooperation and a sharing of the land.

The treaty was very specifically between the Peneteka band and the German Immigration Company. No other band or tribe was involved.

Many tribal members were defrauded of whatever remained of their land and possessions. Appointed paramount chief by the United States government, Chief [[Quanah Parker]] campaigned vigorously for better deals for his people, meeting with Washington politicians frequently; and helped manage land for the tribe. Parker became wealthy as a cattleman. Parker also campaigned for the Comanches' permission to practice the [[Native American Church]] religious rites, such as the usage of [[peyote]], which was condemned by European Americans.<ref>{{cite book|last=Leahy|first=Todd|title=The A to Z of Native American Movements|year=2009|publisher=Scarecrow Press|isbn=978-0-8108-6892-2|author2=Wilson, Raymond|page=120}}</ref>\n\nBefore the first Oklahoma legislature, Quanah testified:\n<blockquote>I do not think this legislature should interfere with a man's religion, also these people should be allowed to retain this health restorer.

About half of the Comanche population still lives in Oklahoma, centered on the town of Lawton.\n\nRecently, an 80-minute 1920 silent film was \"rediscovered\", titled ''[[The Daughter of Dawn]].''

One or more of the older women assisted as [[Midwifery|midwives]]. Men were not allowed inside the tipi during or immediately after the delivery.<ref>Wallace and Hoebel (1952) p.142</ref>\n\nFirst, the midwives softened the [[earthen floor]] of the tipi and dug two holes. One of the holes was for heating water and the other for the [[Placenta|afterbirth]]. One or two stakes were driven into the ground near the expectant mother's bedding for her to grip during the pain of labor. After the birth, the midwives hung the [[umbilical cord]] on a [[Celtis|hackberry]] tree. The people believed that if the umbilical cord was not disturbed before it rotted, the baby would live a long and prosperous life.<ref>Wallace and Hoebel (1952) pp.143, 144</ref>\n\nThe newborn was [[Swaddling|swaddled]] and remained with its mother in the tipi for a few days. The baby was placed in a [[cradleboard]], and the mother went back to work. She could easily carry the cradleboard on her back, or prop it against a tree where the baby could watch her while she collected seeds or roots. Cradleboards consisted of a flat board to which a basket was attached. The latter was made from rawhide straps, or a leather sheath that laced up the front. With soft, dry moss as a diaper, the young one was safely tucked into the leather pocket. During cold weather, the baby was wrapped in blankets, and then placed in the cradleboard. The baby remained in the cradleboard for about ten months; then it was allowed to crawl around.<ref name=\"Wallace and Hoebel 1952 p.120\">Wallace and Hoebel (1952) p.120</ref>\n\nBoth girls and boys were welcomed into the band, but boys were favored. If the baby was a boy, one of the midwives informed the father or grandfather, \"It's your close friend\". Families might paint a flap on the tipi to tell the rest of the tribe that they had been strengthened with another warrior. Sometimes a man named his child, but mostly the father asked a [[medicine man]] (or another man of distinction) to do so. He did this in the hope of his child living a long and productive life. During the public naming ceremony, the medicine man lit his pipe and offered smoke to the heavens, earth, and each of the four directions. He prayed that the child would remain happy and healthy. He then lifted the child to symbolize its growing up and announced the child's name four times. He held the child a little higher each time he said the name. It was believed that the child's name foretold its future; even a weak or sick child could grow up to be a great warrior, hunter, and raider if given a name suggesting courage and strength.<ref name=\"Wallace and Hoebel 1952 p.120\"/> Boys were often named after their grandfather, uncle, or other relative. Girls were usually named after one of their father's relatives, but the name was selected by the mother. As children grew up they also acquired nicknames at different points in their lives, to express some aspect of their lives.<ref>Wallace and Hoebel (1952) pp.122, 123</ref>\n\n===Children===\n\nThe Comanche looked on their children as their most precious gift. Children were rarely punished.<ref>Wallace and Hoebel (1952) p.124</ref> Sometimes, though, an older sister or other relative was called upon to discipline a child, or the parents arranged for a [[boogey man]] to scare the child. Occasionally, old people donned sheets and frightened disobedient boys and girls. Children were also told about Big Maneater Owl (''Pia Mupitsi''), who lived in a cave on the south side of the [[Wichita Mountains]] and ate bad children at night.<ref>{{cite book|last=De Capua|first=Sarah|title=The Comanche|year=2006|publisher=Benchmark Books|isbn=978-0-7614-2249-5|pages=22, 23}}</ref>\n\nChildren learned from example, by observing and listening to their parents and others in the band. As soon as she was old enough to walk, a girl followed her mother about the camp and played at the daily tasks of cooking and making clothing. She was also very close to her mother's sisters, who were called not aunt but ''pia'', meaning mother. She was given a little deerskin doll, which she took with her everywhere. She learned to make all the clothing for the doll.<ref name=\"WH124125\"/>\n\nA boy identified not only with his father but with his father's family, as well as with the bravest warriors in the band. He learned to ride a horse before he could walk. By the time he was four or five, he was expected to be able to skillfully handle a horse. When he was five or six, he was given a small [[Bow (weapon)|bow]] and [[arrow (weapon)|arrow]]s. Often, a boy was taught to ride and shoot by his grandfather, since his father and other warriors were on raids and hunts. His grandfather also taught him about his own boyhood and the history and legends of the Comanche.<ref name=\"WH125-132\"/>\n\n[[File:Comanchechild.jpg|thumb|upright|A 19th-century Comanche child.]]\nAs the boy grew older, he joined the other boys to hunt birds. He eventually ranged farther from camp looking for better game to kill. Encouraged to be skillful hunters, boys learned the signs of the [[prairie]] as they learned to patiently and quietly stalk game. They became more self-reliant, yet, by playing together as a group, also formed the strong bonds and cooperative spirit that they would need when they hunted and raided.<ref name=\"WH125-132\"/>\n[[File:Comanches.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Comanches of West [[Texas]] in war regalia, c. 1830.]]\n\nBoys were highly respected because they would become warriors and might die young in battle. As he approached manhood, a boy went on his first buffalo hunt. If he made a kill, his father honored him with a feast. Only after he had proven himself on a buffalo hunt was a young man allowed to go to war.<ref name=\"WH125-132\"/>\n\nWhen he was ready to become a warrior, at about age fifteen or sixteen, a young man first \"made his medicine\" by going on a [[vision quest]] (a [[rite of passage]]). Following this quest, his father gave the young man a good horse to ride into battle and another mount for the trail. If he had proved himself as a warrior, a Give Away Dance might be held in his honor. As drummers faced east, the honored boy and other young men danced. His parents, along with his other relatives and the people in the band, threw presents at his feet \u2013 especially blankets and horses symbolized by sticks. Anyone might snatch one of the gifts for themselves, although those with many possessions refrained; they did not want to appear greedy. People often gave away all their belongings during these dances, providing for others in the band, but leaving themselves with nothing.<ref name=\"WH125-132\">Wallace and Hoebel (1952) pp.126\u2013132</ref>\n\nGirls learned to gather healthy berries, nuts, and roots. They carried water and collected wood, and when about twelve years old learned to cook meals, make tipis, sew clothing, prepare hides, and perform other tasks essential to becoming a wife and mother. They were then considered ready to be married.<ref name=\"WH124125\">Wallace and Hoebel (1952) pp.124, 125</ref>\n\n===Death===\nDuring the 19th century, the traditional Comanche burial custom was to wrap the deceased's body in a blanket and place it on a horse, behind a rider, who would then ride in search of an appropriate burial place, such as a secure cave. After entombment, the rider covered the body with stones and returned to camp, where the mourners burned all the deceased's possessions. The primary mourner slashed his arms to express his grief. The Quahada band followed this custom longer than other bands and buried their relatives in the [[Wichita Mountains]]. Christian missionaries persuaded Comanche people to bury their dead in coffins in graveyards,<ref>Kroeker</ref> which is the practice today.\n\n===Transportation and habitation===\n[[File:Catlin -- Comanche warrior and tipi.jpg|thumb|left|Comanche Tipis painted by [[George Catlin]].]]\n[[File:Ako, a Comanche warrior and horse -.jpg|thumb|Comanche warrior ''Ako'' and horse.

Photo by James Mooney, 1892.]]\nWhen they lived with the Shoshone, the Comanche mainly used dog-drawn [[travois]] for transportation. Later, they acquired horses from other tribes, such as the Pueblo, and from the Spaniards. Since horses are faster, easier to control and able to carry more, this helped with their hunting and warfare and made moving camp easier. Larger dwellings were made due to the ability to pull and carry more belongings. Being herbivores, horses were also easier to feed than dogs, since meat was a valuable resource.<ref>Rollings, Deer (2004) pp 20\u201324</ref> The horse was of the utmost value to the Comanche. A Comanche man's wealth was measured by the size of his horse herd. Horses were prime targets to steal during raids; often raids were conducted specifically to capture horses. Often horse herds numbering in the hundreds were stolen by Comanche during raids against other Indian nations, Spanish, Mexicans, and later from the ranches of Texans. Horses were used for warfare with the Comanche being considered to be among the finest light cavalry and mounted warriors in history.<ref>{{cite web|title=Indian Culture and the Horse|url=http://paulrittman.com/Indian%20Culture%20and%20the%20Horse.pdf|accessdate=2013-05-26}}</ref>\n[[File:Comanche Feats of Horsemanship-George Catlin.jpg|thumb|left|''Comanche Feats of Horsemenship'', [[George Catlin]] 1834.]]\n\nThe Comanche sheathed their tipis with a covering made of buffalo hides sewn together. To prepare the buffalo hides, women first spread them on the ground, then scraped away the fat and flesh with blades made from bones or antlers, and left them in the sun. When the hides were dry, they scraped off the thick hair, and then soaked them in water. After several days, they vigorously rubbed the hides in a mixture of animal fat, brains, and liver to soften the hides. The hides were made even more supple by further rinsing and working back and forth over a rawhide thong. Finally, they were smoked over a fire, which gave the hides a light tan color. To finish the tipi covering, women laid the tanned hides side by side and stitched them together. As many as 22 hides could be used, but 14 was the average. When finished, the hide covering was tied to a pole and raised, wrapped around the cone-shaped frame, and pinned together with pencil-sized wooden skewers. Two wing-shaped flaps at the top of the tipi were turned back to make an opening, which could be adjusted to keep out the moisture and held pockets of insulating air. With a fire pit in the center of the earthen floor, the tipis stayed warm in the winter. In the summer, the bottom edges of the tipis could be rolled up to let cool breezes in. Cooking was done outside during the hot weather. Tipis were very practical homes for itinerant people. Working together, women could quickly set them up or take them down. An entire Comanche band could be packed and chasing a buffalo herd within about 20 minutes. The Comanche women were the ones who did the most work with food processing and preparation.<ref>Rollings, Deer (2004) pp. 29\u201330</ref>\n\n===Food===\n[[File:Comanche Indians Chasing Buffalo with Lances and Bows.jpg|thumb|Comanches chasing bison, painted by [[George Catlin]]. The bison were the primary food source for the Comanche.]]\nThe Comanche were initially [[hunter-gatherers]]. When they lived in the [[Rocky Mountains]], during their migration to the Great Plains, both men and women shared the responsibility of gathering and providing food. When the Comanche reached the plains, hunting came to predominate. Hunting was considered a male activity and was a principal source of prestige. For meat, the Comanche hunted [[Plains bison|buffalo]], [[elk]], [[American black bear|black bear]], [[pronghorn]], and [[deer]]. When game was scarce, the men hunted wild mustangs, sometimes eating their own ponies. In later years the Comanche raided Texas ranches and stole longhorn cattle. They did not eat fish or fowl, unless starving, when they would eat virtually any creature they could catch, including [[armadillo]]s, [[skunk]]s, [[rat]]s, [[lizard]]s, [[frog]]s, and [[grasshopper]]s. Buffalo meat and other game was prepared and cooked by the women. The women also gathered wild fruits, seeds, nuts, berries, roots, and tubers \u2014 including [[plum]]s, [[grape]]s, [[juniper]] berries, [[persimmon]]s, [[mulberry|mulberries]], [[acorn]]s, [[pecan]]s, wild [[onion]]s, [[radish]]es, and the fruit of the prickly [[pear cactus]]. The Comanche also acquired [[maize]], dried [[pumpkin]], and [[tobacco]] through trade and raids. Most meats were roasted over a fire or boiled. To boil fresh or dried meat and vegetables, women dug a pit in the ground, which they lined with animal skins or buffalo stomach and filled with water to make a kind of cooking pot. They placed heated stones in the water until it boiled and had cooked their stew. After they came into contact with the Spanish, the Comanche traded for copper pots and iron kettles, which made cooking easier.\n\nWomen used berries and nuts, as well as honey and [[tallow]], to flavor buffalo meat. They stored the tallow in intestine casings or rawhide pouches called ''oy\u00f3ot\u00fb\u00bf''. They especially liked to make a sweet mush of buffalo marrow mixed with crushed mesquite beans.\n\nThe Comanches sometimes ate raw meat, especially raw liver flavored with [[bile|gall]]. They also drank the milk from the slashed udders of buffalo, deer, and elk.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Indians of Texas: from prehistoric to modern times|last=Newcomb, Jr.|first=W.W.|publisher=University of Texas Press|year=2002|isbn=978-0-292-78425-3|location=|pages=[https://archive.org/details/indiansoftexasfr00newc/page/164 164]|url=https://archive.org/details/indiansoftexasfr00newc/page/164}}</ref> Among their delicacies was the curdled milk from the stomachs of suckling buffalo calves. They also enjoyed buffalo tripe, or stomachs.\n\nComanche people generally had a light meal in the morning and a large evening meal. During the day they ate whenever they were hungry or when it was convenient. Like other [[Plains Indians]], the Comanche were very hospitable people. They prepared meals whenever a visitor arrived in camp, which led to outsiders' belief that the Comanches ate at all hours of the day or night. Before calling a public event, the chief took a morsel of food, held it to the sky, and then buried it as a peace offering to the Great Spirit. Many families offered thanks as they sat down to eat their meals in their tipis.\n\nComanche children ate [[pemmican]], but this was primarily a tasty, high-energy food reserved for war parties. Carried in a parfleche pouch, pemmican was eaten only when the men did not have time to hunt. Similarly, in camp, people ate pemmican only when other food was scarce. Traders ate pemmican sliced and dipped in honey, which they called Indian bread.\n\n===Clothing===\n[[File:Feather headdress Comanche EthnM.jpg|thumb|upright|Comanche [[headdress]] at the Ethnologisches Museum, Berlin.]]\n[[File:Chosequah- Comanche Indian.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Chosequah, a Comanche warrior wearing full traditional regalia. Painted by [[Elbridge Ayer Burbank|E.A Burbank]], 1897.]]\nComanche clothing was simple and easy to wear. Men wore a leather belt with a breechcloth \u2014 a long piece of buckskin that was brought up between the legs and looped over and under the belt at the front and back, and loose-fitting deerskin leggings. [[Moccasins]] had soles made from thick, tough buffalo hide with soft deerskin uppers. The Comanche men wore nothing on the upper body except in the winter, when they wore warm, heavy robes made from buffalo hides (or occasionally, [[American black bear|bear]], [[wolf]], or [[coyote]] skins) with knee-length buffalo-hide boots. Young boys usually went without clothes except in cold weather. When they reached the age of eight or nine, they began to wear the clothing of a Comanche adult. In the 19th century, men used woven cloth to replace the buckskin breechcloths, and the men began wearing loose-fitting buckskin shirts. The women decorated their shirts, leggings and moccasins with fringes made of deer-skin, animal fur, and human hair. They also decorated their shirts and leggings with patterns and shapes formed with beads and scraps of material. Comanche women wore long deerskin dresses. The dresses had a flared skirt and wide, long sleeves, and were trimmed with buckskin fringes along the sleeves and hem. Beads and pieces of metal were attached in geometric patterns. Comanche women wore buckskin moccasins with buffalo soles. In the winter they, too, wore warm buffalo robes and tall, fur-lined buffalo-hide boots.\nUnlike the boys, young girls did not go without clothes. As soon as they were able to walk, they were dressed in breechcloths. By the age of twelve or thirteen, they adopted the clothes of Comanche women.<ref>Rollings, Deer (2004) p. 31</ref>\n\n===Hair and headgear===\nComanche people took pride in their hair, which was worn long and rarely cut. They arranged their hair with [[porcupine]] quill brushes, greased it and parted it in the center from the forehead to the back of the neck. They painted the scalp along the parting with yellow, red, or white clay (or other colors). They wore their hair in two long braids tied with leather thongs or colored cloth, and sometimes wrapped with [[beaver]] fur. They also braided a strand of hair from the top of their head. This slender braid, called a scalp lock, was decorated with colored scraps of cloth and beads, and a single feather. Comanche men rarely wore anything on their heads. Only after they moved onto a reservation late in the 19th century did Comanche men begin to wear the typical Plains [[headdress]]. If the winter was severely cold, they might wear a brimless, woolly buffalo hide hat. When they went to war, some warriors wore a headdress made from a buffalo's scalp. Warriors cut away most of the hide and flesh from a buffalo head, leaving only a portion of the woolly hair and the horns. This type of woolly, horned buffalo hat was worn only by the Comanche. Comanche women did not let their hair grow as long as the men did. Young women might wear their hair long and braided, but women parted their hair in the middle and kept it short. Like the men, they painted their scalp along the parting with bright paint.<ref>Rollings, Deer (2004) pp. 31, 32</ref>\n\n===Body decoration===\nComanche men usually had [[pierced ears]] with hanging earrings made from pieces of shell or loops of brass or silver wire. A female relative would pierce the outer edge of the ear with six or eight holes. The men also [[tattoo]]ed their face, arms, and chest with geometric designs, and painted their face and body. Traditionally they used paints made from berry juice and the colored clays of the Comancheria. Later, traders supplied them with vermilion (red pigment) and bright grease paints. Comanche men also wore bands of leather and strips of metal on their arms. Except for black, which was the color for war, there was no standard color or pattern for face and body painting: it was a matter of individual preference. For example, one Comanche might paint one side of his face white and the other side red; another might paint one side of his body green and the other side with green and black stripes. One Comanche might always paint himself in a particular way, while another might change the colors and designs when so inclined. Some designs had special meaning to the individual, and special colors and designs might have been revealed in a dream. Comanche women might also tattoo their face or arms. They were fond of painting their bodies and were free to paint themselves however they pleased. A popular pattern among the women was to paint the insides of their ears a bright red and paint great orange and red circles on their cheeks. They usually painted red and yellow around their lips.<ref>Rollings, Deer (2004) pp. 32, 33</ref> \n[[File:Comanche ration bag 1880 OHS.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Comanche beaded ration bag, c. 1880, collection of the [[Oklahoma History Center]]]]\n\n===Arts and crafts===\nBecause of their frequent traveling, Comanche Indians had to make sure that their household goods and other possessions were unbreakable. They did not use pottery that could easily be broken on long journeys. Basketry, weaving, wood carving, and metal working were also unknown among the Comanches. Instead, they depended upon the buffalo for most of their tools, household goods, and weapons. They made nearly 200 different articles from the horns, hide, and bones of the buffalo.\n\nRemoving the lining of the inner stomach, women made the paunch into a water bag. The lining was stretched over four sticks and then filled with water to make a pot for cooking soups and stews. With wood scarce on the plains, women relied on buffalo chips (dried dung) to fuel the fires that cooked meals and warmed the people through long winters.<ref>Rollings, Deer (2004) p 28</ref>\n\nStiff rawhide was fashioned into saddles, stirrups and cinches, knife cases, buckets, and moccasin soles. Rawhide was also made into rattles and drums. Strips of rawhide were twisted into sturdy ropes. Scraped to resemble white parchment, rawhide skins were folded to make parfleches in which food, clothing, and other personal belongings were kept. Women also [[Tanning (leather)|tanned hides]] to make soft and supple buckskin, which was used for tipi covers, warm robes, blankets, cloths, and moccasins. They also relied upon buckskin for bedding, cradles, dolls, bags, pouches, quivers, and gun cases.\n\n[[Sinew]] was used for bowstrings and sewing thread. Hooves were turned into glue and rattles. The horns were shaped into cups, spoons, and ladles, while the tail made a good whip, a fly-swatter, or a decoration for the tipi. Men made tools, scrapers, and needles from the bones, as well as a kind of pipe, and fashioned toys for their children. As warriors, however, men concentrated on making bows and arrows, lances, and shields. The thick neck skin of an old bull was ideal for war shields that deflected arrows as well as bullets. Since they spent most of each day on horseback, they also fashioned leather into saddles, stirrups, and other equipment for their mounts. Buffalo hair was used to fill saddle pads and was also used in rope and halters.<ref>Rollings, Deer (2004) pp 25, 26</ref>\n\n===Language===\n{{Main|Comanche language}}\n[[File:Charles Chibitty.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Charles Chibitty]], Comanche [[code talker]] in [[World War II]]]]\n\nThe language spoken by the [[Comanche people]], ''[[Comanche language|Comanche]]'' (''N<s>u</s>m<s>u</s> tekwap<u><s>u</s></u>''), is a [[Numic languages|Numic language]] of the [[Uto-Aztecan languages|Uto-Aztecan language group]]. It is closely related to the [[Shoshone language|language of the Shoshone]], from which the Comanche diverged around 1700. The two languages remain closely related, but a few low-level sound changes inhibit mutual intelligibility. The earliest records of Comanche from 1786 clearly show a dialect of Shoshone, but by the beginning of the 20th century, these sound changes had modified the way Comanche sounded in subtle, but profound, ways.<ref>McLaughlin (1992), 158-81</ref><ref>McLaughlin (2000), 293\u2013304</ref> Although efforts are now being made to ensure survival of the language, most of its speakers are elderly, and less than one percent of the Comanches can speak it.\n\nIn the late 19th century, many Comanche children were placed in boarding schools with children from different tribes. The children were taught English and discouraged from speaking their native language. Anecdotally, enforcement of speaking English was severe.\n\nQuanah Parker learned and spoke English and was adamant that his own children do the same. The second generation then grew up speaking English, because it was believed{{who|date=June 2014}} that it was better for them not to know Comanche.<ref name=\"H\u00e4m\u00e4l\u00e4inen 2008, p.171\">H\u00e4m\u00e4l\u00e4inen (2008), p.171</ref>\n\nDuring [[World War II]], a group of 17 young men, referred to as \"The Comanche [[Code talker|Code Talkers]]\", were trained and used by the [[U.S. Army]] to send messages conveying sensitive information that could not be deciphered by the Germans.<ref>{{cite book|last=Holm|first=Tom|title=Code Talkers and Warriors: Native Americans and World War II|year=2007|publisher=Chelsea House Publications|isbn=978-0-7910-9340-5|pages=[https://archive.org/details/codetalkerswarri00holm_0/page/108 108\u2013120]|chapter=The Comanche Code Talkers|chapter-url=https://archive.org/details/codetalkerswarri00holm_0/page/108}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.nbcnews.com/storyline/d-day-70th-anniversary/comanche-indians-honor-d-day-code-talkers-n126216|work=D-Day 70th Anniversary|title=Comanche Indians Honor D-Day Code-Talkers|date=June 9, 2014|publisher=NBC News }}</ref>\n\n==Notable Comanches==\n<!--Please only add people with pre-existing Wikipedia articles-->\n*[[Spirit Talker]] ([[Mukwooru]]) (c. 1780-1840), Penateka chief and medicine man \n*[[Old Owl]] ([[Mupitsukup\u0289]]) (late 1780s\u20131849), Penateka chief \n*[[Amorous Man]] (Pahayoko) (late 1780s\u2013c. 1860), Penateka chief \n*[[Ten Bears]] (Paw\u0289\u0289ras\u0289m\u0289nun\u0289) (c. 1790\u20131872), chief of the Ketahto and later of the Yamparika band\n*[[Santa Anna (Comanche war chief)|Santa Anna]] (c. 1800-c. 1849), war chief of the Penateka Band \n*[[Buffalo Hump]] (Pots\u0289nakwahip\u0289) (c. 1800-c. 1865/1870), war chief and later head chief of the Penateka Band \n*[[Iron Jacket]] (Puhihwikwasu'u) (c. 1790-1858), war chief and later head chief of the Quahadi band; father of Peta Nocona\n*[[Horseback (Comanche)|Horseback]] (T\u0289h\u0289yakwahip\u0289) (c. 1805/1810-c. 1888), chief of the Nokoni band\n*[[Tosawi]] (White Knife) (c. 1805/1810-c. 1878/1880), chief of the Penateka band\n*[[Peta Nocona]] (Lone Wanderer) (c. 1820-c. 1864), chief of the Nokoni division; father of Quanah Parker\n*[[Piaru-ekaruhkapu]] (Big Red Meat) (c. 1820/1825-1875), Nokoni chief \n*[[Isatai]] (c. 1840\u2013c. 1890), warrior and medicine man of the Quahadi band \n*[[Diane O'Leary]] (1939\u20132013), artist, nurse\n*[[Quanah Parker]] (c. 1845\u20131911), Quahadi chief, a founder of [[Native American Church]], and successful rancher\n[[File:Comanche chief.jpg|thumb|upright|Mo'o-wai (\"Pushing aside\" or \"Pushing-in-the-middle\"), aka \"Shaking Hand\", chief of the Kotsoteka]]\n*[[White Parker]] (1887\u20131956), son of Quanah Parker and Methodist missionary\n*[[Gil Birmingham]] (born 1953), actor, ''[[Into the West (TV miniseries)|Into the West]]''\n*[[Blackbear Bosin]] (1921\u20131980), Kiowa-Comanche sculptor and painter\n*[[Charles Chibitty]] (1921\u20132005), World War II Comanche code talker\n*[[Marie C.

It was his first release through RCA, which would be his label for the next decade. Following the [[hard rock]] sound of ''[[The Man Who Sold the World (album)|The Man Who Sold the World]]'', ''Hunky Dory'' marked a move towards [[art rock]] and [[art pop]] styles. Co-produced by [[Ken Scott]] and Bowie himself, it was recorded in mid-1971 at [[Trident Studios]] in London and featured [[Rick Wakeman]] on piano and the musicians who would later be known as [[the Spiders from Mars]] \u2013 comprising [[Mick Ronson]], [[Trevor Bolder]] and [[Mick Woodmansey]]. The album cover, photographed by Brian Ward and airbrushed by Terry Pastor, was influenced by a [[Marlene Dietrich]] photo book that Bowie took with him to the photoshoot.<ref>{{cite book |title=1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die |last=Dimery |first=Robert |year=2005 |publisher=Quintet Publishing |location=London |isbn=978-1-84403-392-8 |page=[https://archive.org/details/1001albumsyoumus0000unse_l0q0/page/254 254] |url=https://archive.org/details/1001albumsyoumus0000unse_l0q0/page/254 }}</ref>\n\nThe album was initially released to favourable critical and commercial reception but wasn't a major success until the commercial breakthrough of his following album ''[[The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars]]'' (1972). It was supported by the singles \"[[Changes (David Bowie song)|Changes]]\" in 1972 and \"[[Life on Mars (song)|Life on Mars?]]\" in 1973. Retrospectively, ''Hunky Dory'' has received critical acclaim and is regarded as one of Bowie's best works. ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' chose it as part of their \"100 best albums of all time\" list in January 2010, with journalist [[Josh Tyrangiel]] praising Bowie's \"earthbound ambition to be a [[Bohemianism|boho]] poet with prodigal style\".<ref name=time /> The album has been reissued multiple times and remastered in 2015 as part of the ''[[Five Years (1969\u20131973)]]'' box set.\n\n== Background ==\nFollowing the completion of his third studio album ''[[The Man Who Sold the World (album)|The Man Who Sold the World]]'' in May 1970, Bowie became less active in both the studio and on stage. This was partly due to challenges that were confronting his new manager [[Tony Defries]], who Bowie hired after firing his old manager [[Kenneth Pitt]] and departing music publisher Essex Music.{{sfn|Cann|2010|pp=195\u2013196}}{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=603}} After hearing Bowie's new single \"[[Holy Holy]]\", Defries signed a contract with Chrysalis but thereafter limited his work with Bowie to focus on other projects, including attempting to sign American singer-songwriter [[Stevie Wonder]] following his contract ending with [[Motown Records]]. Because of this, Bowie, who was devoting himself to songwriting, turned to Chrysalis partner Bob Grace. Grace, according to biographer Nicholas Pegg, had \"courted\" Bowie on \"the strength of 'Holy Holy'\", and subsequently booked time at [[Radio Luxembourg]]'s studios in London for Bowie to record his demos.{{sfn|Cann|2010|pp=195\u2013196}}{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=603}} According to his then-wife [[Angie Bowie|Angela]], Bowie had spent time composing songs on piano rather than guitar, which would \"infuse the flavour of the new album.\"{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=603}}\n\nIn August 1970, due to his disillusionment with Bowie's lack of enthusiasm during the sessions for ''The Man Who Sold the World'' and his dislike of Defries, bassist and producer [[Tony Visconti]] parted ways with Bowie; it was the last time he would see the artist for three to four years.{{sfn|Cann|2010|p=197}}{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=601}} [[Mick Ronson]] and [[Mick Woodmansey|Woody Woodmansey]], who played guitar and drums, respectively for ''The Man Who Sold the World'', similarly parted ways with Bowie, primarily due to their disgruntlement with the artist on top of not being paid for their performances.{{sfn|Cann|2010|p=197}} Visconti would then produce music for glam rock artist [[Marc Bolan]] while Ronson and Woodmansey went to [[Haddon Hall]] and formed a short-lived group called Ronno with Benny Marshall of [[The Rats (British band)|the Rats]].{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=601}}{{sfn|Cann|2010|p=214}} \n\nThe first song Bowie wrote and demoed for ''Hunky Dory'' was \"[[Oh! You Pretty Things]]\" in January 1971. After recording a demo at Radio Luxembourg, Bowie gave the tape to Grace, who showed it to [[Peter Noone]] of [[Herman's Hermits]]. Noone decided to record \"Oh! You Pretty Things\" and released it as his debut single later that year.{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=604}}{{sfn|Cann|2010|pp=202\u2013203}} Noone's version reached number 12 on the [[UK Singles Chart]] in mid-June, with Noone telling ''[[NME]]'': \"My view is that David Bowie is the best writer in Britain at the moment...certainly the best since [[Lennon\u2013McCartney|Lennon and McCartney]].\"{{sfn|Cann|2010|p=220}} It was at this studio where Bowie wrote future ''Ziggy Stardust'' tracks \"[[Moonage Daydream]]\" and \"[[Hang On to Yourself]]\", which he recorded with his short-lived band [[Arnold Corns]] in February 1971.{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=604}}{{sfn|Cann|2010|pp=206\u2013207}}\n\n== Writing and recording ==\nAfter the minimal critical and commercial impact of his Arnold Corns project and leaving Mercury Records, Bowie regrouped in the studio in May 1971 to begin work on his next album.{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=606}}{{sfn|Cann|2010|pp=216, 218}} Initially, he was joined by Arnold Corns guitarist Mark Pritchett, ''Space Oddity'' drummer [[Terry Cox]] and his former Turquoise colleague Tony Hill. However, he came to the conclusion that he couldn't do the project without Ronson.{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=606}} Ronson, who had not talked to Bowie in nine months and had become depressed, was enthusiastic when Bowie contacted him. Woodmansey returned with Ronson, who recruited a new bass player to replace Visconti. He initially suggested [[Rick Kemp]], who Bowie recorded with in the King Bees in the mid-1960s. However, upon meeting Bowie at Haddon Hall to audition, Bowie was dismissive of him and, according to Pegg, some reports say that Defries rejected Kemp on the grounds of his \"receding hairline;\" Kemp would instead join the English folk rock band [[Steeleye Span]].{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=606}} So, Ronson suggested his acquaintance [[Trevor Bolder]], a former hairdresser and piano tuner who had previously seen Bowie live in 1970 and met Ronson at Haddon Hall.{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=606}}{{sfn|Cann|2010|p=218}} Upon Bolder's hiring, the trio grouped at Haddon to rehearse some of Bowie's new material, of which included album track \"[[Andy Warhol (song)|Andy Warhol]]\".{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=606}}\n\n[[File:Ken Scott - 2014-11-14 - Andy Mabbett.JPG|thumb|upright=0.65|alt=Ken Scott in 2014|''Hunky Dory'' was the first production collaboration between Bowie and [[Ken Scott]] ''(pictured in 2014)''.]]\nFollowing the birth of his son [[Duncan Jones|Duncan]], Bowie wrote the song \"[[Kooks (song)|Kooks]]\" as a tribute to him. Also known as 'Zowie', Bowie would tell David Wigg in 1973: \"I got the name [Zowie] from a [[Batman]] comic.\"{{sfn|Cann|2010|p=218}} On 3 June, Bowie and the Spiders, along with traveled to the BBC's Paris Studios in London to record for [[John Peel]]'s radio show ''In Concert''. They were joined by [[Dana Gillespie]], Mark Pritchett, Geoffrey MacCormack (better known as [[Warren Peace]]) and George Underwood.{{sfn|Cann|2010|p=219}}{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=1,093}} The songs they performed were all originals written by Bowie, apart from a cover of [[Chuck Berry]]'s \"[[Almost Grown (song)|Almost Grown]]\" and [[Ron Davies (songwriter)|Ron Davies]]' \"It Ain't Easy\",{{sfn|Cann|2010|p=219}} which was to be recorded for ''Ziggy Stardust'' a year later.{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=1,093}} The performance began with \"[[Queen Bitch]]\" and \"[[Bombers (David Bowie song)|Bombers]]\", which Peel says will both be on the upcoming album, although \"Bombers\" was to replaced by the cover \"Fill Your Heart\".{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=160}} They also played \"[[The Supermen]]\" from ''The Man Who Sold the World'', \"Looking for a Friend\" (which was sung by Pritchett), \"[[Song for Bob Dylan]]\" (which was sung by Underwood) and \"Andy Warhol\" (which was sung by Gillespie).{{sfn|Cann|2010|p=219}}{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=1,093}} Although Bowie's backing trio were referred to as \"members of a group called Ronno\", the session would become the first performance with the trio who would become known as [[the Spiders from Mars]] and who would record with him for the next three years.{{sfn|Cann|2010|p=218}}{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=1,093}}<ref name=\"Gallucci UCR\" /> \n\n{{quote box|quote=[''Hunky Dory''] is very much a duo record.

The \"actor\" was Bowie himself, whose \"pet conceit\", in the words of ''[[NME]]'' critics [[Roy Carr]] and [[Charles Shaar Murray]], was \"to think of himself as an actor\".{{sfn|Carr|Murray|1981|pp=7\u201311}} Keyboardist [[Rick Wakeman]], then of the [[Strawbs]] and a noted [[session musician]],{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=607}} plays piano on the album.{{sfn|Buckley|2005|p=93}} Wakeman was asked to play during the album's sessions and accepted. He recalled in 1995 that he met Bowie in late June 1971 at [[Haddon Hall]] in [[Bakewell]], [[Derbyshire]], where Bowie played him demos of \"Changes\" and \"[[Life on Mars?]]\" in \"their raw brilliance\". He recalled: \"He [played] the finest selection of songs I have ever heard in one sitting in my entire life...I couldn't wait to get into the studio and record them.\"{{sfn|Cann|2010|p=223}}\n\n== Style and themes ==\n[[File:Rickwakemanmoog.jpg|thumb|upright=0.8|alt=Rick Wakeman performing in 2012|The album features prominent piano by [[Yes (band)|Yes]] keyboardist [[Rick Wakeman]] ''(pictured in 2012)''.]]\nAuthor [[Peter Doggett]] describes ''Hunky Dory'' as \"a collective of attractively accessible pop songs, through which Bowie tested out his feelings about the nature of stardom and power.\"{{sfn|Doggett|2012|p=11}} Musical biographer David Buckley said of the album: \"Its almost easy-listening status and conventional musical sensibility has detracted from the fact that, lyrically, this record lays down the blueprint for Bowie's future career.\"<ref name=buckstrange1>{{cite book |title=Strange Fascination \u2013 David Bowie: The Definitive Story |last=Buckley |first=David |year=2000 |origyear=1999 |publisher=Virgin Books |location=London |isbn=0-7535-0457-X |page=112}}</ref> The opening track, \"[[Changes (David Bowie song)|Changes]]\", focused on the compulsive nature of artistic reinvention (\"Strange fascination, fascinating me/Changes are taking the pace I'm going through\") and distancing oneself from the rock mainstream (\"Look out, you rock 'n' rollers\"). However, the composer also took time to pay tribute to his influences with the tracks \"[[Song for Bob Dylan]]\", \"[[Andy Warhol (David Bowie song)|Andy Warhol]]\" and the [[The Velvet Underground|Velvet Underground]] inspired \"[[Queen Bitch]]\".\n\nFollowing the [[hard rock]] of Bowie's previous album ''[[The Man Who Sold the World (album)|The Man Who Sold the World]]'', ''Hunky Dory'' saw the partial return of the fey pop singer of ''[[Space Oddity (album)|Space Oddity]]'', with light fare such as \"[[Kooks (song)|Kooks]]\" and the cover \"Fill Your Heart\" sitting alongside heavier material like the [[occult]]-tinged \"[[Quicksand (David Bowie song)|Quicksand]]\" (whose lyric mentions the Golden Dawn (i.e. the [[Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn]]) and [[Aleister Crowley]]) and the semi-autobiographical \"[[The Bewlay Brothers]]\".

You Pretty Things]]\", whose pop tune hid lyrics, inspired by [[Friedrich Nietzsche|Nietzsche]], predicting the imminent replacement of modern man by \"the [[\u00dcbermensch|Homo Superior]]\", and which has been cited as a direct precursor to \"[[Starman (song)|Starman]]\" from Bowie's next album, ''[[The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars]]''.{{sfn|Carr|Murray|1981|p=44}}\n\n== Release and aftermath ==\n{{Album ratings\n|rev1 = [[AllMusic]]\n|rev1score = {{Rating|5|5}}<ref name=\"Erlewine AllMusic\">{{cite web|last=Erlewine|first=Stephen Thomas|authorlink=Stephen Thomas Erlewine|title=''Hunky Dory'' \u2013 David Bowie|url=https://www.allmusic.com/album/hunky-dory-mw0000189509|website=[[AllMusic]]|accessdate=13 March 2004|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120615072909/http://www.allmusic.com/album/hunky-dory-mw0000189509|archive-date=15 June 2012|url-status=live}}</ref>\n|rev2 = ''[[Blender (magazine)|Blender]]''\n|rev2score = {{Rating|5|5}}<ref>{{cite journal|title=David Bowie: Hunky Dory|url=http://www.blender.com/guide/reviews.aspx?ID=3887|work=[[Blender (magazine)|Blender]]|issue=47|date=May 2006|accessdate=14 July 2016|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070823012137/http://www.blender.com/guide/reviews.aspx?ID=3887|archivedate=23 August 2007}}</ref>\n|rev3 = ''[[Chicago Tribune]]''\n|rev3score = {{Rating|3.5|4}}<ref>{{cite news|last=Kot|first=Greg|authorlink=Greg Kot|title=Bowie's Many Faces Are Profiled on Compact Disc|url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1990-06-10/entertainment/9002170173_1_space-oddity-scary-monsters-ziggy-stardust|work=[[Chicago Tribune]]|date=10 June 1990|accessdate=14 July 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160416150839/http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1990-06-10/entertainment/9002170173_1_space-oddity-scary-monsters-ziggy-stardust|archive-date=16 April 2016|url-status=live}}</ref>\n|rev4 = ''[[Encyclopedia of Popular Music]]''\n|rev4Score = {{Rating|5|5}}<ref>{{cite book|title=[[Encyclopedia of Popular Music|The Encyclopedia of Popular Music]]|publisher=[[Omnibus Press]]|edition=5th concise|year=2011|last=Larkin|first=Colin|authorlink=Colin Larkin (writer)|isbn=0-85712-595-8|chapter=David Bowie}}</ref>\n|rev5 = ''[[Pitchfork (website)|Pitchfork]]''\n|rev5score = 10/10<ref name=\"Wolk Pitchfork\">{{cite web|last=Wolk|first=Douglas|authorlink=Douglas Wolk|url=https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21066-five-years-1969-1973/|title=David Bowie: ''Five Years 1969\u20131973''|work=[[Pitchfork (website)|Pitchfork]]|date=1 October 2015|accessdate=21 November 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160206231305/http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21066-five-years-1969-1973/|archive-date=6 February 2016|url-status=live}}</ref>\n|rev6 = ''[[Rolling Stone]]''\n|rev6score = {{Rating|5|5}}<ref>{{cite journal|last=Sheffield|first=Rob|authorlink=Rob Sheffield|title=David Bowie: ''Hunky Dory'' (reissue)|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/reviews/cd/review.asp?aid=50071&cf=331|work=[[Rolling Stone]]|date=18 March 1999|accessdate=14 July 2016|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20031003202846/http://www.rollingstone.com/reviews/cd/review.asp?aid=50071&cf=331|archivedate=3 October 2003}}</ref>\n|rev7 = ''[[The Rolling Stone Album Guide]]''\n|rev7Score = {{Rating|5|5}}<ref>{{cite book|last=Sheffield|first=Rob|authorlink=Rob Sheffield|chapter=David Bowie|title=[[The Rolling Stone Album Guide|The New Rolling Stone Album Guide]]|editor1-last=Brackett|editor1-first=Nathan|editor2-last=Hoard|editor2-first=Christian|publisher=[[Simon & Schuster]]|edition=4th|year=2004|pages=[https://archive.org/details/newrollingstonea00brac/page/97 97\u201399]|isbn=0-7432-0169-8}}</ref>\n|rev8 = ''[[Spin (magazine)|Spin]]''\n|rev8score = {{Rating|5|5}}<ref>{{cite journal|last=Dolan|first=Jon|title=How to Buy: David Bowie|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=s5jfV6kXmTEC&lpg=PP1&pg=PA84|work=[[Spin (magazine)|Spin]]|volume=22|issue=7|date=July 2006|accessdate=14 July 2016|page=84|journal=|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171002175230/https://books.google.com/books?id=s5jfV6kXmTEC&lpg=PP1&pg=PA84|archive-date=2 October 2017|url-status=live}}</ref>\n|rev9 = ''[[Spin Alternative Record Guide]]''\n|rev9score = 9/10{{sfn|Weisbard|Marks|1995|page=55}}\n|rev10 = ''[[The Village Voice]]''\n|rev10Score = A\u2212<ref name=\"Christgau\">{{cite news|last=Christgau|first=Robert|authorlink=Robert Christgau|url=http://www.robertchristgau.com/xg/cg/cg22.php|title=Consumer Guide (22)|newspaper=[[The Village Voice]]|location=New York|date=30 December 1971|accessdate=28 April 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130815194640/http://robertchristgau.com/xg/cg/cg22.php|archive-date=15 August 2013|url-status=live}}</ref>\n}}\nFollowing the success of Peter Noone's version of \"Oh!

It was his first release through RCA, which would be his label for the next decade. Following the [[hard rock]] sound of ''[[The Man Who Sold the World (album)|The Man Who Sold the World]]'', ''Hunky Dory'' marked a move towards [[art rock]] and [[art pop]] styles. Co-produced by [[Ken Scott]] and Bowie himself, it was recorded in mid-1971 at [[Trident Studios]] in London and featured [[Rick Wakeman]] on piano and the musicians who would later be known as [[the Spiders from Mars]] \u2013 comprising [[Mick Ronson]], [[Trevor Bolder]] and [[Mick Woodmansey]]. The album cover, photographed by Brian Ward and airbrushed by Terry Pastor, was influenced by a [[Marlene Dietrich]] photo book that Bowie took with him to the photoshoot.<ref>{{cite book |title=1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die |last=Dimery |first=Robert |year=2005 |publisher=Quintet Publishing |location=London |isbn=978-1-84403-392-8 |page=[https://archive.org/details/1001albumsyoumus0000unse_l0q0/page/254 254] |url=https://archive.org/details/1001albumsyoumus0000unse_l0q0/page/254 }}</ref>\n\nThe album was initially released to favourable critical and commercial reception but wasn't a major success until the commercial breakthrough of his following album ''[[The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars]]'' (1972). It was supported by the singles \"[[Changes (David Bowie song)|Changes]]\" in 1972 and \"[[Life on Mars (song)|Life on Mars?]]\" in 1973. Retrospectively, ''Hunky Dory'' has received critical acclaim and is regarded as one of Bowie's best works. ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' chose it as part of their \"100 best albums of all time\" list in January 2010, with journalist [[Josh Tyrangiel]] praising Bowie's \"earthbound ambition to be a [[Bohemianism|boho]] poet with prodigal style\".<ref name=time /> The album has been reissued multiple times and remastered in 2015 as part of the ''[[Five Years (1969\u20131973)]]'' box set.\n\n== Background ==\nFollowing the completion of his third studio album ''[[The Man Who Sold the World (album)|The Man Who Sold the World]]'' in May 1970, Bowie became less active in both the studio and on stage. This was partly due to challenges that were confronting his new manager [[Tony Defries]], who Bowie hired after firing his old manager [[Kenneth Pitt]] and departing music publisher Essex Music.{{sfn|Cann|2010|pp=195\u2013196}}{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=603}} After hearing Bowie's new single \"[[Holy Holy]]\", Defries signed a contract with Chrysalis but thereafter limited his work with Bowie to focus on other projects, including attempting to sign American singer-songwriter [[Stevie Wonder]] following his contract ending with [[Motown Records]]. Because of this, Bowie, who was devoting himself to songwriting, turned to Chrysalis partner Bob Grace. Grace, according to biographer Nicholas Pegg, had \"courted\" Bowie on \"the strength of 'Holy Holy'\", and subsequently booked time at [[Radio Luxembourg]]'s studios in London for Bowie to record his demos.{{sfn|Cann|2010|pp=195\u2013196}}{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=603}} According to his then-wife [[Angie Bowie|Angela]], Bowie had spent time composing songs on piano rather than guitar, which would \"infuse the flavour of the new album.\"{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=603}}\n\nIn August 1970, due to his disillusionment with Bowie's lack of enthusiasm during the sessions for ''The Man Who Sold the World'' and his dislike of Defries, bassist and producer [[Tony Visconti]] parted ways with Bowie; it was the last time he would see the artist for three to four years.{{sfn|Cann|2010|p=197}}{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=601}} [[Mick Ronson]] and [[Mick Woodmansey|Woody Woodmansey]], who played guitar and drums, respectively for ''The Man Who Sold the World'', similarly parted ways with Bowie, primarily due to their disgruntlement with the artist on top of not being paid for their performances.{{sfn|Cann|2010|p=197}} Visconti would then produce music for glam rock artist [[Marc Bolan]] while Ronson and Woodmansey went to [[Haddon Hall]] and formed a short-lived group called Ronno with Benny Marshall of [[The Rats (British band)|the Rats]].{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=601}}{{sfn|Cann|2010|p=214}} \n\nThe first song Bowie wrote and demoed for ''Hunky Dory'' was \"[[Oh! You Pretty Things]]\" in January 1971. After recording a demo at Radio Luxembourg, Bowie gave the tape to Grace, who showed it to [[Peter Noone]] of [[Herman's Hermits]]. Noone decided to record \"Oh! You Pretty Things\" and released it as his debut single later that year.{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=604}}{{sfn|Cann|2010|pp=202\u2013203}} Noone's version reached number 12 on the [[UK Singles Chart]] in mid-June, with Noone telling ''[[NME]]'': \"My view is that David Bowie is the best writer in Britain at the moment...certainly the best since [[Lennon\u2013McCartney|Lennon and McCartney]].\"{{sfn|Cann|2010|p=220}} It was at this studio where Bowie wrote future ''Ziggy Stardust'' tracks \"[[Moonage Daydream]]\" and \"[[Hang On to Yourself]]\", which he recorded with his short-lived band [[Arnold Corns]] in February 1971.{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=604}}{{sfn|Cann|2010|pp=206\u2013207}}\n\n== Writing and recording ==\nAfter the minimal critical and commercial impact of his Arnold Corns project and leaving Mercury Records, Bowie regrouped in the studio in May 1971 to begin work on his next album.{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=606}}{{sfn|Cann|2010|pp=216, 218}} Initially, he was joined by Arnold Corns guitarist Mark Pritchett, ''Space Oddity'' drummer [[Terry Cox]] and his former Turquoise colleague Tony Hill. However, he came to the conclusion that he couldn't do the project without Ronson.{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=606}} Ronson, who had not talked to Bowie in nine months and had become depressed, was enthusiastic when Bowie contacted him. Woodmansey returned with Ronson, who recruited a new bass player to replace Visconti. He initially suggested [[Rick Kemp]], who Bowie recorded with in the King Bees in the mid-1960s. However, upon meeting Bowie at Haddon Hall to audition, Bowie was dismissive of him and, according to Pegg, some reports say that Defries rejected Kemp on the grounds of his \"receding hairline;\" Kemp would instead join the English folk rock band [[Steeleye Span]].{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=606}} So, Ronson suggested his acquaintance [[Trevor Bolder]], a former hairdresser and piano tuner who had previously seen Bowie live in 1970 and met Ronson at Haddon Hall.{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=606}}{{sfn|Cann|2010|p=218}} Upon Bolder's hiring, the trio grouped at Haddon to rehearse some of Bowie's new material, of which included album track \"[[Andy Warhol (song)|Andy Warhol]]\".{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=606}}\n\n[[File:Ken Scott - 2014-11-14 - Andy Mabbett.JPG|thumb|upright=0.65|alt=Ken Scott in 2014|''Hunky Dory'' was the first production collaboration between Bowie and [[Ken Scott]] ''(pictured in 2014)''.]]\nFollowing the birth of his son [[Duncan Jones|Duncan]], Bowie wrote the song \"[[Kooks (song)|Kooks]]\" as a tribute to him. Also known as 'Zowie', Bowie would tell David Wigg in 1973: \"I got the name [Zowie] from a [[Batman]] comic.\"{{sfn|Cann|2010|p=218}} On 3 June, Bowie and the Spiders, along with traveled to the BBC's Paris Studios in London to record for [[John Peel]]'s radio show ''In Concert''.

He recalled in 1995 that he met Bowie in late June 1971 at [[Haddon Hall]] in [[Bakewell]], [[Derbyshire]], where Bowie played him demos of \"Changes\" and \"[[Life on Mars?]]\" in \"their raw brilliance\".

However, the composer also took time to pay tribute to his influences with the tracks \"[[Song for Bob Dylan]]\", \"[[Andy Warhol (David Bowie song)|Andy Warhol]]\" and the [[The Velvet Underground|Velvet Underground]] inspired \"[[Queen Bitch]]\".\n\nFollowing the [[hard rock]] of Bowie's previous album ''[[The Man Who Sold the World (album)|The Man Who Sold the World]]'', ''Hunky Dory'' saw the partial return of the fey pop singer of ''[[Space Oddity (album)|Space Oddity]]'', with light fare such as \"[[Kooks (song)|Kooks]]\" and the cover \"Fill Your Heart\" sitting alongside heavier material like the [[occult]]-tinged \"[[Quicksand (David Bowie song)|Quicksand]]\" (whose lyric mentions the Golden Dawn (i.e. the [[Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn]]) and [[Aleister Crowley]]) and the semi-autobiographical \"[[The Bewlay Brothers]]\". Between the two extremes was \"[[Oh! You Pretty Things]]\", whose pop tune hid lyrics, inspired by [[Friedrich Nietzsche|Nietzsche]], predicting the imminent replacement of modern man by \"the [[\u00dcbermensch|Homo Superior]]\", and which has been cited as a direct precursor to \"[[Starman (song)|Starman]]\" from Bowie's next album, ''[[The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars]]''.{{sfn|Carr|Murray|1981|p=44}}\n\n== Release and aftermath ==\n{{Album ratings\n|rev1 = [[AllMusic]]\n|rev1score = {{Rating|5|5}}<ref name=\"Erlewine AllMusic\">{{cite web|last=Erlewine|first=Stephen Thomas|authorlink=Stephen Thomas Erlewine|title=''Hunky Dory'' \u2013 David Bowie|url=https://www.allmusic.com/album/hunky-dory-mw0000189509|website=[[AllMusic]]|accessdate=13 March 2004|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120615072909/http://www.allmusic.com/album/hunky-dory-mw0000189509|archive-date=15 June 2012|url-status=live}}</ref>\n|rev2 = ''[[Blender (magazine)|Blender]]''\n|rev2score = {{Rating|5|5}}<ref>{{cite journal|title=David Bowie: Hunky Dory|url=http://www.blender.com/guide/reviews.aspx?ID=3887|work=[[Blender (magazine)|Blender]]|issue=47|date=May 2006|accessdate=14 July 2016|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070823012137/http://www.blender.com/guide/reviews.aspx?ID=3887|archivedate=23 August 2007}}</ref>\n|rev3 = ''[[Chicago Tribune]]''\n|rev3score = {{Rating|3.5|4}}<ref>{{cite news|last=Kot|first=Greg|authorlink=Greg Kot|title=Bowie's Many Faces Are Profiled on Compact Disc|url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1990-06-10/entertainment/9002170173_1_space-oddity-scary-monsters-ziggy-stardust|work=[[Chicago Tribune]]|date=10 June 1990|accessdate=14 July 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160416150839/http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1990-06-10/entertainment/9002170173_1_space-oddity-scary-monsters-ziggy-stardust|archive-date=16 April 2016|url-status=live}}</ref>\n|rev4 = ''[[Encyclopedia of Popular Music]]''\n|rev4Score = {{Rating|5|5}}<ref>{{cite book|title=[[Encyclopedia of Popular Music|The Encyclopedia of Popular Music]]|publisher=[[Omnibus Press]]|edition=5th concise|year=2011|last=Larkin|first=Colin|authorlink=Colin Larkin (writer)|isbn=0-85712-595-8|chapter=David Bowie}}</ref>\n|rev5 = ''[[Pitchfork (website)|Pitchfork]]''\n|rev5score = 10/10<ref name=\"Wolk Pitchfork\">{{cite web|last=Wolk|first=Douglas|authorlink=Douglas Wolk|url=https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21066-five-years-1969-1973/|title=David Bowie: ''Five Years 1969\u20131973''|work=[[Pitchfork (website)|Pitchfork]]|date=1 October 2015|accessdate=21 November 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160206231305/http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21066-five-years-1969-1973/|archive-date=6 February 2016|url-status=live}}</ref>\n|rev6 = ''[[Rolling Stone]]''\n|rev6score = {{Rating|5|5}}<ref>{{cite journal|last=Sheffield|first=Rob|authorlink=Rob Sheffield|title=David Bowie: ''Hunky Dory'' (reissue)|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/reviews/cd/review.asp?aid=50071&cf=331|work=[[Rolling Stone]]|date=18 March 1999|accessdate=14 July 2016|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20031003202846/http://www.rollingstone.com/reviews/cd/review.asp?aid=50071&cf=331|archivedate=3 October 2003}}</ref>\n|rev7 = ''[[The Rolling Stone Album Guide]]''\n|rev7Score = {{Rating|5|5}}<ref>{{cite book|last=Sheffield|first=Rob|authorlink=Rob Sheffield|chapter=David Bowie|title=[[The Rolling Stone Album Guide|The New Rolling Stone Album Guide]]|editor1-last=Brackett|editor1-first=Nathan|editor2-last=Hoard|editor2-first=Christian|publisher=[[Simon & Schuster]]|edition=4th|year=2004|pages=[https://archive.org/details/newrollingstonea00brac/page/97 97\u201399]|isbn=0-7432-0169-8}}</ref>\n|rev8 = ''[[Spin (magazine)|Spin]]''\n|rev8score = {{Rating|5|5}}<ref>{{cite journal|last=Dolan|first=Jon|title=How to Buy: David Bowie|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=s5jfV6kXmTEC&lpg=PP1&pg=PA84|work=[[Spin (magazine)|Spin]]|volume=22|issue=7|date=July 2006|accessdate=14 July 2016|page=84|journal=|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171002175230/https://books.google.com/books?id=s5jfV6kXmTEC&lpg=PP1&pg=PA84|archive-date=2 October 2017|url-status=live}}</ref>\n|rev9 = ''[[Spin Alternative Record Guide]]''\n|rev9score = 9/10{{sfn|Weisbard|Marks|1995|page=55}}\n|rev10 = ''[[The Village Voice]]''\n|rev10Score = A\u2212<ref name=\"Christgau\">{{cite news|last=Christgau|first=Robert|authorlink=Robert Christgau|url=http://www.robertchristgau.com/xg/cg/cg22.php|title=Consumer Guide (22)|newspaper=[[The Village Voice]]|location=New York|date=30 December 1971|accessdate=28 April 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130815194640/http://robertchristgau.com/xg/cg/cg22.php|archive-date=15 August 2013|url-status=live}}</ref>\n}}\nFollowing the success of Peter Noone's version of \"Oh!

He was captain and central midfield player during the 1970s and was a key player in the QPR side which came close to winning their first-ever league title in 1976. He won 12 [[cap (football)|caps]] for the [[England national football team|England team]] between 1974 and 1976, and was captain for eight of those matches.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.englandfootballonline.com/TeamPlyrsBios/PlayersF/BioFrancisGCJ.html|title=England Players \u2013 Gerry Francis|website=www.englandfootballonline.com|access-date=27 March 2019}}</ref> His International career was limited by a persistent back injury.

They finished ninth in 1993\u201394 and eighth in 1994\u201395, but in November 1994, Francis left [[Loftus Road]] for [[Tottenham Hotspur F.C.|Tottenham Hotspur]].\n\nDuring his three years in charge at QPR, Francis fielded a side containing some of the most feared players in the top flight. Arguably the finest player at the club during this time was striker [[Les Ferdinand]], who had joined the club from non-league [[Hayes F.C.|Hayes]] in 1986 but not established himself in the first team until the [[1990-91 in English football|season before Francis arrived]], when he scored eight goals in 18 First Division games. Francis kept faith in Ferdinand, and was rewarded in 1992\u201393 when the player hit 20 league goals in one season. Ferdinand remained at QPR until his \u00a36million transfer to Newcastle in 1995, by which time he had scored 78 goals in five league campaigns and was one of the most feared strikers in England, being [[England national football team|capped]] for the first time in 1993. In July 1997, while manager of Tottenham Hotspur, Francis signed Ferdinand for \u00a36million.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sporting-heroes.net/football/queens-park-rangers-fc/gerry-francis-6819/league-appearances-for-qpr_a14590/|title=Gerry Francis|website=www.sporting-heroes.net|accessdate=25 January 2018}}</ref>\n\nWith the resignation of [[Graham Taylor (footballer)|Graham Taylor]] as [[England national football team]] manager in November 1993 following failure to qualify for the [[1994 FIFA World Cup|World Cup]], Francis was one of the many names linked to the vacancy, but the job went to [[Terry Venables]] instead. In March 1994, ambitious Division One club [[Wolverhampton Wanderers F.C.|Wolverhampton Wanderers]] made a lucrative approach for Francis to drop down a division and take charge of the club looking to make the breakthrough to the Premier League, but he rejected the offer and Wolves turned to Graham Taylor instead.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football-peacock-goes-but-francis-stays-mixed-day-at-queens-park-rangers-while-limpar-joins-everton-and-beagrie-hops-to-city-1431375.html|title=Football: Peacock goes but Francis stays: Mixed day at Queen's Park|date=25 March 1994|publisher=|accessdate=25 January 2018}}</ref>\n\n===Tottenham Hotspur===\n1994\u201395 was a 'nearly' season for Tottenham. They finished seventh in the Premier League \u2013 two places off a [[UEFA Cup]] place \u2013 and lost to [[Everton F.C.|Everton]] in the semi finals of the [[FA Cup]]. Mid table finishes in the next two seasons were unconvincing and Francis resigned in November 1997 with Spurs battling against relegation from the Premier League. During his time at Tottenham Francis became resented by the fans over his handling of star player [[Darren Anderton]]. It has been argued that Francis is largely responsible for Anderton's recurring injuries, placing him in the team without sufficient time to recover, which resulted in Anderton's appearing in only eight games in the 1995\u201396 season and 17 games in the 1996\u201397 season.\n\n===Back to QPR===\nIn September 1998, Gerry Francis was named as QPR manager for the second time. They had slumped since his departure four years earlier and were now [[Football League First Division|Division One]] strugglers. He kept them clear of relegation over the next two seasons before finally resigning in February 2001 with a return to the lower half of the league imminent after more than 30 years. He briefly became Director of Football at QPR before beginning his second spell as manager of Bristol Rovers in June 2001.\n\n===Bristol Rovers again===\nThree successive wins at the start of the 2001\u201302 campaign gave the Pirates hope for promotion back to [[Football League Second Division|Division Two]], but injuries soon took their toll on the side's form and Francis resigned just before Christmas. The Pirates continued to slide and missed out on relegation to the [[Football Conference|Conference]] by just one place.

He was captain and central midfield player during the 1970s and was a key player in the QPR side which came close to winning their first-ever league title in 1976. He won 12 [[cap (football)|caps]] for the [[England national football team|England team]] between 1974 and 1976, and was captain for eight of those matches.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.englandfootballonline.com/TeamPlyrsBios/PlayersF/BioFrancisGCJ.html|title=England Players \u2013 Gerry Francis|website=www.englandfootballonline.com|access-date=27 March 2019}}</ref> His International career was limited by a persistent back injury.

They finished ninth in 1993\u201394 and eighth in 1994\u201395, but in November 1994, Francis left [[Loftus Road]] for [[Tottenham Hotspur F.C.|Tottenham Hotspur]].\n\nDuring his three years in charge at QPR, Francis fielded a side containing some of the most feared players in the top flight. Arguably the finest player at the club during this time was striker [[Les Ferdinand]], who had joined the club from non-league [[Hayes F.C.|Hayes]] in 1986 but not established himself in the first team until the [[1990-91 in English football|season before Francis arrived]], when he scored eight goals in 18 First Division games. Francis kept faith in Ferdinand, and was rewarded in 1992\u201393 when the player hit 20 league goals in one season. Ferdinand remained at QPR until his \u00a36million transfer to Newcastle in 1995, by which time he had scored 78 goals in five league campaigns and was one of the most feared strikers in England, being [[England national football team|capped]] for the first time in 1993. In July 1997, while manager of Tottenham Hotspur, Francis signed Ferdinand for \u00a36million.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sporting-heroes.net/football/queens-park-rangers-fc/gerry-francis-6819/league-appearances-for-qpr_a14590/|title=Gerry Francis|website=www.sporting-heroes.net|accessdate=25 January 2018}}</ref>\n\nWith the resignation of [[Graham Taylor (footballer)|Graham Taylor]] as [[England national football team]] manager in November 1993 following failure to qualify for the [[1994 FIFA World Cup|World Cup]], Francis was one of the many names linked to the vacancy, but the job went to [[Terry Venables]] instead. In March 1994, ambitious Division One club [[Wolverhampton Wanderers F.C.|Wolverhampton Wanderers]] made a lucrative approach for Francis to drop down a division and take charge of the club looking to make the breakthrough to the Premier League, but he rejected the offer and Wolves turned to Graham Taylor instead.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football-peacock-goes-but-francis-stays-mixed-day-at-queens-park-rangers-while-limpar-joins-everton-and-beagrie-hops-to-city-1431375.html|title=Football: Peacock goes but Francis stays: Mixed day at Queen's Park|date=25 March 1994|publisher=|accessdate=25 January 2018}}</ref>\n\n===Tottenham Hotspur===\n1994\u201395 was a 'nearly' season for Tottenham. They finished seventh in the Premier League \u2013 two places off a [[UEFA Cup]] place \u2013 and lost to [[Everton F.C.|Everton]] in the semi finals of the [[FA Cup]]. Mid table finishes in the next two seasons were unconvincing and Francis resigned in November 1997 with Spurs battling against relegation from the Premier League. During his time at Tottenham Francis became resented by the fans over his handling of star player [[Darren Anderton]]. It has been argued that Francis is largely responsible for Anderton's recurring injuries, placing him in the team without sufficient time to recover, which resulted in Anderton's appearing in only eight games in the 1995\u201396 season and 17 games in the 1996\u201397 season.\n\n===Back to QPR===\nIn September 1998, Gerry Francis was named as QPR manager for the second time. They had slumped since his departure four years earlier and were now [[Football League First Division|Division One]] strugglers. He kept them clear of relegation over the next two seasons before finally resigning in February 2001 with a return to the lower half of the league imminent after more than 30 years. He briefly became Director of Football at QPR before beginning his second spell as manager of Bristol Rovers in June 2001.\n\n===Bristol Rovers again===\nThree successive wins at the start of the 2001\u201302 campaign gave the Pirates hope for promotion back to [[Football League Second Division|Division Two]], but injuries soon took their toll on the side's form and Francis resigned just before Christmas. The Pirates continued to slide and missed out on relegation to the [[Football Conference|Conference]] by just one place. Gerry Francis worked with Graham Muxworthy and [[Ian Holloway]] whilst at Bristol Rovers. Francis has not been in management since.\n\n===Stoke City===\nOn 4 October 2008, he was offered a position of first team coach at [[Newcastle United F.C.|Newcastle United]], however due to the uncertainty over the period of the role he decided to take up an offer from [[Stoke City F.C.|Stoke City]] to become their first team coach.

Led by intellectuals educated at European universities or American missionary schools in Turkey, Armenians began to question their second-class status and press for better treatment from their government. In one such instance, after amassing the signatures of peasants from Western Armenia, the Armenian Communal Council petitioned the Ottoman government to redress their principal grievances: \"the looting and murder in Armenian towns by [Muslim] [[Kurds]] and [[Circassians]], improprieties during tax collection, criminal behavior by government officials and the refusal to accept Christians as witnesses in trial\".

The Russians were receptive and drew up the clause, but the Ottomans flatly rejected it during negotiations.

In 1908, elements of the Third Army and the Second Army Corps declared their opposition to the Sultan and threatened to march on the capital to depose him.

The Armenian population formed a significant minority in this region.\n\nAn important consequence of the [[Balkan Wars]] was also the mass expulsion of Muslims (known as ''[[muhacir]]s'') from the Balkans. Beginning in the mid-19th century, hundreds of thousands of Muslims, including [[Turkish people|Turks]], [[Circassians]], and [[Chechens]], were forcibly expelled and others voluntarily migrated from the [[Caucasus]] and the Balkans ([[Rumelia]]) as a result of the Russo-Turkish wars, the [[Circassian genocide]] and the conflicts in the Balkans. Muslim society in the empire was incensed by this flood of refugees. A journal published in Constantinople expressed the mood of the times: \"Let this be a warning&nbsp;... O Muslims, don't get comfortable! Do not let your blood cool before taking revenge\".<ref name=\"Ak\u00e7am\" />{{rp |86}} As many as 850,000 of these refugees were settled in areas where the Armenians resided. The ''muhacirs'' resented the status of their relatively well-off neighbors and, as historian [[Taner Ak\u00e7am]] and others have noted, some of them came to play a pivotal role in the killings of the Armenians and the [[Confiscated Armenian properties in Turkey|confiscation of their properties]] during the genocide.<ref name=\"Ak\u00e7am\" />{{rp |86\u201387}}\n\n== World War I ==\n{{See also|Middle Eastern theatre of World War I}}\nOn 2 November 1914, the Ottoman Empire opened the Middle Eastern theater of World War I by entering hostilities on the side of the [[Central Powers]] and against the [[Allies of World War I|Allies]].

Before entering the war, the [[Imperial Government (Ottoman Empire)|Ottoman government]] had sent representatives to the [[Armenian congress at Erzurum]] to persuade Ottoman Armenians to facilitate its conquest of [[Transcaucasia]] by inciting an insurrection of Russian Armenians against the Russian army in the event a [[Caucasus Campaign|Caucasus front]] was opened.<ref name=\"Ak\u00e7am\" />{{rp |136}}<ref>{{Cite book | last1 = Walker | first1 = Christopher J | authorlink = Christopher J.

Germany had brokered a deal with the [[Sublime Porte]] to commission the building of a railroad called the [[Baghdad Railway]] that would stretch from Berlin to the Middle East. At the beginning of 1915, Germany's diplomatic mission was led by Ambassador [[Hans Freiherr von Wangenheim]] who, upon his death in 1915, was succeeded by Count [[Paul Wolff Metternich]]. Like Morgenthau, von Wangenheim began receiving many disturbing messages from consular officials around the Ottoman Empire that detailed the massacres of Armenians. From the province of [[Adana]], Consul Eugene Buge reported that the CUP chief had sworn to massacre any Armenians who had survived the deportation marches.<ref name=\"Balakian\" />{{rp |186}} In June 1915, von Wangenheim sent a cable to Berlin reporting that Talaat had admitted that the deportations were not \"being carried out because of 'military considerations alone'\". One month later, he came to the conclusion that there \"no longer was doubt that the Porte was trying to exterminate the Armenian race in the Turkish Empire\".<ref name=\"Fromkin\" />{{rp |213}}\n\nWhen Wolff-Metternich succeeded von Wangenheim, he continued to dispatch similar cables: \"The Committee [CUP] demands the extirpation of the last remnants of the Armenians and the government must yield&nbsp;... A Committee representative is assigned to each of the provincial administrations&nbsp;... [[Turkification]] means license to expel, to kill or destroy everything that is not Turkish\".<ref>''[[Ausw\u00e4rtiges Amt]]'', West German Foreign Office Archives, K170, no. 4674, folio 63, in [[Peter Balakian|Balakian]], ''[[The Burning Tigris]]'', p. 186.</ref><ref name=\"judgment-at-istanbul\" />{{rp|161}}\n[[File:Morgen23.gif|thumb|Report from a German missionary on the massacre of Armenians from Erzerum, 31 July 1915]]\nAnother notable figure in the German military camp was [[Max Erwin von Scheubner-Richter]], who documented various massacres of Armenians. He sent fifteen reports regarding \"deportations and mass killings\" to the German chancellery. His final report noted that fewer than 100,000 Armenians were left alive in the Ottoman Empire: the rest having been exterminated ({{lang-de |ausgerottet}}).<ref name=\"Fisk\" />{{rp |329\u201330}} Scheubner-Richter also detailed the methods of the Ottoman government, noting its use of the Special Organization and other bureaucratized instruments of genocide, as well as how the Ottomans would provoke and exaggerate Armenian self-defense in order to create the illusion of a rebellion. This was to give justification for the deportation of Armenians, which is still argued by genocide deniers to this day.<ref>{{cite book| last1=Ambrosio| first1=Thomas| title=Ethnic identity groups and U.S. foreign policy|date=2002|publisher=Praeger|location=Westport (Conn.)| isbn=0275975320|pages=155\u20136|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0bsHGrl9p4sC}}</ref> Richter stated the deportations were intentionally meant to cover up the slaughter of Armenians:\n\n{{quote|I have conducted a series of conversations with competent and influential Turkish personages, and these are my impressions: A large segment of the Ittihadist [Young Turk] party maintains the viewpoint that the Turkish empire should be based only on the principle of Islam and Pan-Turkism.

These gentlemen believe that the time is propitious for the realization of this plan. The first item on this agenda concerns the liquidation of the Armenians. Ittihad will dangle before the Allies a specter of an alleged revolution prepared by the Armenian Dashnak party. Moreover, local incidents of social unrest and acts of Armenian self-defense will deliberately be provoked and inflated and will be used as pretexts to effect the deportations. Once en route, however, the convoys will be attacked and exterminated by Kurdish and Turkish brigands, and in part by gendarmes, who will be instigated for that purpose by Ittihad.<ref>{{cite book| last=Charney| first=Israel|title=The Widening Circle of Genocide|publisher=W.

I also know that both Armenians and Turks cannot live together in this country. One of these races has got to go. And I don't blame the Turks for what they are doing to the Armenians.

The discovery of this photograph prompted English journalist [[Robert Fisk]] to draw a direct line from the Armenian Genocide to the Holocaust. Fisk, while acknowledging the role playing by most German diplomats and parliamentaries in the condemnation of the Ottoman Turks, noted that some of the German witnesses to the Armenian holocaust would later go on to play a role in the Nazi regime. For example, [[Konstantin Freiherr von Neurath]], who was attached to the Turkish 4th Army in 1915 with instructions to monitor \"operations\" against the Armenians, later became [[Adolf Hitler]]'s foreign minister and \"Protector of Bohemia and Moravia\" during [[Reinhard Heydrich]]'s terror in Czechoslovakia.<ref>{{cite news|author=Robert Fisk |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/photograph-links-germans-to-1915-armenia-genocide-8219537.html |title=Photograph links Germans to 1915 Armenia genocide |newspaper=The Independent |date=21 October 2012 |location=London}}</ref>\n\n==== Armin T.

Led by intellectuals educated at European universities or American missionary schools in Turkey, Armenians began to question their second-class status and press for better treatment from their government. In one such instance, after amassing the signatures of peasants from Western Armenia, the Armenian Communal Council petitioned the Ottoman government to redress their principal grievances: \"the looting and murder in Armenian towns by [Muslim] [[Kurds]] and [[Circassians]], improprieties during tax collection, criminal behavior by government officials and the refusal to accept Christians as witnesses in trial\".

In the wake of these events, Patriarch Nerses and his emissaries made repeated approaches to Russian leaders to urge the inclusion of a clause granting local self-government to the Armenians in the forthcoming [[Treaty of San Stefano]], which was signed on 3 March 1878. The Russians were receptive and drew up the clause, but the Ottomans flatly rejected it during negotiations. In its place, the two sides agreed on a clause making the [[Sublime Porte]]'s implementation of reforms in the Armenian provinces a condition of Russia's withdrawal, thus designating Russia the guarantor of the reforms.<ref>{{citation |title=Treaty of San Stefano |quote=As the evacuation of the Russian troops of the territory they occupy in Armenia&nbsp;... might give rise to conflicts and complications detrimental to the maintenance of good relations between the two countries, the [[Sublime Porte]] engaged to carry into effect, without further delay, the improvements and reforms demanded by local requirements in the provinces inhabited by Armenians and to guarantee their security from Kurds and [[Circassians]]. |chapter=Article 16|title-link=Treaty of San Stefano }}</ref> The clause entered the treaty as Article 16 and marked the first appearance of what came to be known in European diplomacy as the ''[[Armenian Question]]''.\n\nOn receiving a copy of the treaty, Britain promptly objected to it and particularly Article 16, which it saw as ceding too much influence to Russia.

Despite an ambiguous reference to Great Power supervision, the clause failed to offset the removal of the Russian guarantee with any tangible equivalent, thus leaving the timing and fate of the reforms to the discretion of the [[Sublime Porte]].<ref name=\"Ak\u00e7am\" />{{rp|38\u201339}} The clause was readily adopted as Article 61 of the [[Treaty of Berlin (1878)|Treaty of Berlin]] on the last day of the Congress, 13 July 1878, to the deep disappointment of the Armenian delegation.\n\n=== Armenian national liberation movement ===\n{{Main|Armenian national liberation movement}}\nProspects for reforms faded rapidly following the signing of the Berlin treaty, as security conditions in the Armenian provinces went from bad to worse and abuses proliferated. Upset with this turn of events, a number of disillusioned Armenian intellectuals living in Europe and Russia decided to form political parties and societies dedicated to the betterment of their compatriots in the Ottoman Empire. In the last quarter of the 19th century, this movement came to be dominated by three parties: the [[Armenakan Party|Armenakan]], whose influence was limited to [[Van, Turkey|Van]]; the [[Social Democrat Hunchakian Party]]; and the [[Armenian Revolutionary Federation]] (Dashnaktsutiun).

It drew its membership from disaffected army officers based in [[Thessaloniki|Salonika]] and was behind a wave of mutinies against the central government. In 1908, elements of the Third Army and the Second Army Corps declared their opposition to the Sultan and threatened to march on the capital to depose him.

The Armenian population formed a significant minority in this region.\n\nAn important consequence of the [[Balkan Wars]] was also the mass expulsion of Muslims (known as ''[[muhacir]]s'') from the Balkans. Beginning in the mid-19th century, hundreds of thousands of Muslims, including [[Turkish people|Turks]], [[Circassians]], and [[Chechens]], were forcibly expelled and others voluntarily migrated from the [[Caucasus]] and the Balkans ([[Rumelia]]) as a result of the Russo-Turkish wars, the [[Circassian genocide]] and the conflicts in the Balkans. Muslim society in the empire was incensed by this flood of refugees. A journal published in Constantinople expressed the mood of the times: \"Let this be a warning&nbsp;... O Muslims, don't get comfortable! Do not let your blood cool before taking revenge\".<ref name=\"Ak\u00e7am\" />{{rp |86}} As many as 850,000 of these refugees were settled in areas where the Armenians resided. The ''muhacirs'' resented the status of their relatively well-off neighbors and, as historian [[Taner Ak\u00e7am]] and others have noted, some of them came to play a pivotal role in the killings of the Armenians and the [[Confiscated Armenian properties in Turkey|confiscation of their properties]] during the genocide.<ref name=\"Ak\u00e7am\" />{{rp |86\u201387}}\n\n== World War I ==\n{{See also|Middle Eastern theatre of World War I}}\nOn 2 November 1914, the Ottoman Empire opened the Middle Eastern theater of World War I by entering hostilities on the side of the [[Central Powers]] and against the [[Allies of World War I|Allies]].

Before entering the war, the [[Imperial Government (Ottoman Empire)|Ottoman government]] had sent representatives to the [[Armenian congress at Erzurum]] to persuade Ottoman Armenians to facilitate its conquest of [[Transcaucasia]] by inciting an insurrection of Russian Armenians against the Russian army in the event a [[Caucasus Campaign|Caucasus front]] was opened.<ref name=\"Ak\u00e7am\" />{{rp |136}}<ref>{{Cite book | last1 = Walker | first1 = Christopher J | authorlink = Christopher J.

Germany had brokered a deal with the [[Sublime Porte]] to commission the building of a railroad called the [[Baghdad Railway]] that would stretch from Berlin to the Middle East. At the beginning of 1915, Germany's diplomatic mission was led by Ambassador [[Hans Freiherr von Wangenheim]] who, upon his death in 1915, was succeeded by Count [[Paul Wolff Metternich]]. Like Morgenthau, von Wangenheim began receiving many disturbing messages from consular officials around the Ottoman Empire that detailed the massacres of Armenians. From the province of [[Adana]], Consul Eugene Buge reported that the CUP chief had sworn to massacre any Armenians who had survived the deportation marches.<ref name=\"Balakian\" />{{rp |186}} In June 1915, von Wangenheim sent a cable to Berlin reporting that Talaat had admitted that the deportations were not \"being carried out because of 'military considerations alone'\". One month later, he came to the conclusion that there \"no longer was doubt that the Porte was trying to exterminate the Armenian race in the Turkish Empire\".<ref name=\"Fromkin\" />{{rp |213}}\n\nWhen Wolff-Metternich succeeded von Wangenheim, he continued to dispatch similar cables: \"The Committee [CUP] demands the extirpation of the last remnants of the Armenians and the government must yield&nbsp;...

These gentlemen believe that the time is propitious for the realization of this plan. The first item on this agenda concerns the liquidation of the Armenians. Ittihad will dangle before the Allies a specter of an alleged revolution prepared by the Armenian Dashnak party. Moreover, local incidents of social unrest and acts of Armenian self-defense will deliberately be provoked and inflated and will be used as pretexts to effect the deportations. Once en route, however, the convoys will be attacked and exterminated by Kurdish and Turkish brigands, and in part by gendarmes, who will be instigated for that purpose by Ittihad.<ref>{{cite book| last=Charney| first=Israel|title=The Widening Circle of Genocide|publisher=W.

The discovery of this photograph prompted English journalist [[Robert Fisk]] to draw a direct line from the Armenian Genocide to the Holocaust. Fisk, while acknowledging the role playing by most German diplomats and parliamentaries in the condemnation of the Ottoman Turks, noted that some of the German witnesses to the Armenian holocaust would later go on to play a role in the Nazi regime. For example, [[Konstantin Freiherr von Neurath]], who was attached to the Turkish 4th Army in 1915 with instructions to monitor \"operations\" against the Armenians, later became [[Adolf Hitler]]'s foreign minister and \"Protector of Bohemia and Moravia\" during [[Reinhard Heydrich]]'s terror in Czechoslovakia.<ref>{{cite news|author=Robert Fisk |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/photograph-links-germans-to-1915-armenia-genocide-8219537.html |title=Photograph links Germans to 1915 Armenia genocide |newspaper=The Independent |date=21 October 2012 |location=London}}</ref>\n\n==== Armin T.
