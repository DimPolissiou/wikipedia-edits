({{lang-fr|link=no|R\u00e9publique du S\u00e9n\u00e9gal}}; [[Wolof language|Wolof]]: R\u00e9ewum Senegaal), is a country in [[West Africa]]. Senegal is bordered by [[Mauritania]] in [[Mauritania\u2013Senegal border|the north]], [[Mali]] to [[Mali\u2013Senegal border|the east]], [[Guinea]] to [[Guinea\u2013Senegal border|the southeast]], and [[Guinea-Bissau]] to [[Guinea-Bissau\u2013Senegal border|the southwest]]. Senegal also [[Gambia\u2013Senegal border|surrounds]] [[The Gambia]], a country occupying a narrow sliver of land along the banks of the [[Gambia River]], which separates Senegal's southern region of [[Casamance]] from the rest of the country. Senegal also shares a maritime border with [[Cape Verde]]. Senegal's economic and political capital is [[Dakar]].\n\nIt is a [[Unitary state|unitary]] [[presidential system|presidential republic]] and is the westernmost country in the mainland of the [[Old World]], or [[Afro-Eurasia]].<ref>Janet H. Gritzner, Charles F. Gritzner \u2013 2009, Senegal \u2013 Page 8</ref> It owes its name to the [[Senegal River]] which borders it to the east and north. Senegal covers a land area of almost {{convert|197000|km2}} and has a population of around {{#expr:{{replace|{{UN_Population|Senegal}}|,||}}/1e6 round 0}} million.{{UN_Population|ref}} The climate is typically [[Sahel]]ian, though there is a [[Wet season|rainy season]].\n\n== Etymology ==\n\"Senegal\" is probably from a [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] transliteration of the name of the [[Zenaga language|Zenaga]] also known as the [[Sanhaja]],<ref name=fas>{{Cite web|url=https://theculturetrip.com/africa/senegal/articles/the-real-story-behind-senegals-name/|title=The Real Story Behind Senegal\u2019s Name|first=Beetle|last=Holloway|website=Culture Trip}}</ref> or a combination of the supreme deity in {{w|Serer religion}} (''Rog Sene'') and ''o gal'' meaning ''body of water'' in the [[Serer language]]. Alternatively, the name could derive from the [[Wolof language|Wolof]] phrase \"Sunuu Gaal,\" which means \"our boat.\"\n\n== Cultures and influences ==\n{{more citations needed section|date=January 2019}}\nThe territory of modern Senegal has been inhabited by various ethnic groups since [[prehistory]]. Organized kingdoms emerged around the seventh century, and parts of the country were ruled by prominent regional empires such as the [[Jolof Empire]]. The present state of Senegal has its roots in European colonialism, which began during the mid-15th century, when various European powers began competing for trade in the area. The establishment of coastal trading posts gradually led to control of the mainland, culminating in French rule of the area by the 19th century, albeit amid much local resistance. Senegal peacefully attained independence from France in 1960, and has since been among the more politically stable countries in Africa.\n\nSenegal's economy is centered mostly on commodities and natural resources. Major industries are fish processing, [[phosphate]] mining, fertilizer production, [[petroleum]] refining, construction materials, and ship construction and repair. As in most African nations, agriculture is a major sector, with Senegal producing several important cash crops, including [[peanut]]s, [[sugarcane]], [[cotton]], [[green bean]]s, [[tomato]]es, [[melon]]s, and [[mango]]es.<ref name=fas/> Owing to its relative stability, tourism and hospitality are also burgeoning sectors.\n\nWith it being a multiethnic and secular nation, Senegal is predominantly [[Sunni Islam|Sunni Muslim]] with [[Sufism|Sufi]] and [[traditional African religion|animist]] influences. French is the [[official language]], although many native languages are spoken and recognized. Since April 2012, Senegal's president has been [[Macky Sall]]. Senegal has been a member of the [[Organisation internationale de la Francophonie]] since 1970.\n\n==History==\n{{main|History of Senegal}}\n\n===Early and pre-colonial eras===\nArchaeological findings throughout the area indicate that Senegal was inhabited in prehistoric times and has been continuously occupied by various ethnic groups. Some kingdoms were created around the 7th century: [[Takrur]] in the 9th century, {{ILL|Namandiru|wo}} and the [[Jolof Empire]] during the 13th and 14th centuries. Eastern Senegal was once part of the [[Ghana Empire]].\n\nIslam was introduced through [[Toucouleur people|Toucouleur]] and [[Soninke people|Soninke]] contact with the [[Almoravid dynasty]] of the [[Maghreb]], who in turn propagated it with the help of the Almoravids, and Toucouleur allies. This movement faced resistance from ethnicities of traditional religions, the Serers in particular.<ref>Klein, Martin A., ''Islam and Imperialism in Senegal: Sine-Saloum, 1847\u20131914'', p. 7, Edinburgh University Press (1968) {{ISBN|0-8047-0621-2}}</ref><ref>[[Henry Gravrand|Gravrand, Henry]], ''La civilisation Sereer, Pangool,'' p. 13. Dakar, Nouvelles Editions Africaines (1990), {{ISBN|2-7236-1055-1}}</ref>\n\nIn the 13th and 14th centuries, the area came under the influence of the empires to the east; the Jolof Empire of Senegal was also founded during this time. In the Senegambia region, between 1300 and 1900, close to one-third of the population was [[Slavery in Africa|enslaved]], typically as a result of captives taken in warfare.<ref>[http://www.britannica.com/blackhistory/article-24157 \"Slavery\"], ''Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica's Guide to Black History'' {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141006131931/http://www.britannica.com/blackhistory/article-24157 |date=6 October 2014 }}</ref>\n\nIn the 14th century the Jolof Empire grew more powerful, having united [[Cayor]] and the kingdoms of [[Baol]], [[Kingdom of Sine|Sine]], [[Saloum]], [[Waalo]], [[Futa Tooro]] and [[Bambouk]], or much of present-day West Africa.

French and British diplomacy in the area were thrown into disarray.\n\n===Independence (1960)===\nOn 4 April 1959 Senegal and the [[French Sudan]] merged to form the [[Mali Federation]], which became fully independent on 20 June 1960, as a result of a transfer of power agreement signed with France on 4 April 1960. Due to internal political difficulties, the Federation broke up on 20 August, when Senegal and French Sudan (renamed the Republic of [[Mali]]) each proclaimed independence.\n\n[[L\u00e9opold S\u00e9dar Senghor]] was Senegal's first president in September 1960. Senghor was a very well-read man, educated in France. He was a poet and philosopher who personally drafted the Senegalese national anthem, \"Pincez tous vos koras, frappez les balafons\". Pro-African, he advocated a brand of African socialism.<ref>''A Critical bibliography of French literature: in three parts. The Twentieth.'' Edited by David Clark Cabeen, Richard A.

Former prime minister [[Mamadou Dia]], who was Senghor's rival, ran for election in 1983 against Diouf, but lost. Senghor moved to France, where he died at the age of 96.\n\nIn the 1980s, [[Boubacar Lam]] discovered Senegalese oral history that was initially compiled by the [[Toucouleur people|Tuculor]] noble, [[Yoro Dy\u00e2o]], not long after [[World War I]], which documented migrations into [[West Africa]] from the [[Nile Valley]]; ethnic groups, from the [[Senegal River]] to the [[Niger Delta]], retained traditions of having an eastern origin.<ref name=\"AfrAm\">{{cite book |last1=Gordon |first1=Jane |title=A Companion to African-American Studies |date=15 April 2008 |publisher=John Wiley & Sons |page=463 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ODmpx1fgJNIC&pg=PA463|isbn=978-1-4051-5466-6}}</ref>\n\nSenegal joined with [[The Gambia]] to form the nominal [[Senegambia Confederation]] on 1 February 1982. However, the union was dissolved in 1989. Despite peace talks, a southern separatist group ([[Movement of Democratic Forces of Casamance]] or MFDC) in the [[Casamance]] region has clashed sporadically with government forces since 1982 in the [[Casamance conflict]]. In the early 21st century, violence has subsided and President [[Macky Sall]] held talks with rebels in Rome in December 2012.<ref>[http://www.ucdp.uu.se/gpdatabase/gpcountry.php?id=135&regionSelect=2-Southern_Africa# \"[[Uppsala Conflict Data Program]]: Senegal: Casamance, In-depth Developments since 2005\"], ''Conflict Encyclopedia''</ref>\n\nAbdou Diouf was president between 1981 and 2000. He encouraged broader political participation, reduced government involvement in the economy, and widened Senegal's diplomatic engagements, particularly with other developing nations. Domestic politics on occasion spilled over into street violence, border tensions, and a violent separatist movement in the southern region of the Casamance. Nevertheless, Senegal's commitment to democracy and human rights strengthened. Abdou Diouf served four terms as president.\n\nIn the presidential election of 1999, opposition leader [[Abdoulaye Wade]] defeated Diouf in an election deemed free and fair by international observers. Senegal experienced its second peaceful transition of power, and its first from one political party to another. On 30 December 2004 President Wade announced that he would sign a peace treaty with the separatist group in the Casamance region. This, however, has yet to be implemented. There was a round of talks in 2005, but the results have not yet yielded a resolution.\n\n==Politics==\n{{main|Politics of Senegal}}\n[[File:Macky Sall - 2008.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Macky Sall]], President of Senegal (2012\u2013present)]]\n[[File:Abdoulaye Wade in 16-05-2007.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Abdoulaye Wade]], President of Senegal (2000\u20132012)]]\n\nSenegal is a [[republic]] with a presidency; the president is [[Elections in Senegal|elected]] every five years as of 2016, previously being seven years from independence to 2001, five years from 2001 to 2008, and 7 years again from 2008 to 2016,  by adult voters. The first president, [[L\u00e9opold S\u00e9dar Senghor]], was a poet and writer, and was the first African elected to the ''Acad\u00e9mie fran\u00e7aise''. Senegal's second president, [[Abdou Diouf]], later served as general secretary of the ''Organisation de la Francophonie''. The third president was [[Abdoulaye Wade]], a lawyer.

The nation's highest courts that deal with business issues are the constitutional council and the court of justice, members of which are named by the president.\n\n===Political culture===\nCurrently, Senegal has a quasi-democratic political culture, one of the more successful post-colonial democratic transitions in Africa. Local administrators are appointed and held accountable by the president. [[Marabout]]s, religious leaders of the various [[Muslim brotherhoods of Senegal]], have also exercised a strong political influence in the country especially during Wade's presidency. In 2009, [[Freedom House]] downgraded Senegal's status from \"Free\" to \"Partially Free\", based on increased centralisation of power in the executive. By 2014, it had recovered its Free status.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.freedomhouse.org/report/freedom-world/2014/senegal-0#.VEWVY_nF-So|title=Senegal - Country report - Freedom in the World - 2014|website=Freedomhouse.org|accessdate=23 August 2017}}</ref>\n\nIn 2008, Senegal finished in 12th position on the [[Ibrahim Index of African Governance]].<ref name=\"ibrahim_index\">{{cite web|url=http://www.moibrahimfoundation.org/en/section/the-ibrahim-index |title=The Ibrahim Index \u00bb Mo Ibrahim Foundation |publisher=Moibrahimfoundation.org |accessdate=3 January 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111229141051/http://www.moibrahimfoundation.org/en/section/the-ibrahim-index |archivedate=29 December 2011 }}</ref> The Ibrahim Index is a comprehensive measure of African governance (limited to [[sub-Saharan Africa]] until 2008), based on a number of different variables which reflect the success with which governments deliver essential political goods to their citizens.

Many of the ''Toucouleurs'', or sedentary Halpulaar of the Senegal River Valley in the north, converted to Islam around a millennium ago and later contributed to Islam's propagation throughout Senegal. Success was gained among the Wolofs, but repulsed by the Serers.\n\nMost communities south of the Senegal River Valley, however, were not thoroughly [[Islamization|Islamized]]. The Serer people stood out as one of this group, who spent over one thousand years resisting Islamization (see [[Serer history (medieval era to present)|Serer history]]). Although many Serers are Christians or Muslim, their conversion to Islam in particular is very recent, who converted on their own free will rather than by force, although force had been tried centuries earlier unsuccessfully (see [[the Battle of Fandane-Thiouthioune]]).<ref>{{cite book|author1=Hans Bressers|author2=Walter A.

In Murid communities, which place more emphasis on the work ethic than on literary Quranic studies, the term ''daara'' often applies to work groups devoted to working for a religious leader. Other Islamic groups include the much older Q\u0101diriyya order and the Senegalese [[Layene|Laayeen]] order, which is prominent among the coastal Lebu. Today, most Senegalese children study at ''daara''s for several years, memorizing as much of the Qur'an as they can. Some of them continue their religious studies at councils (''majlis'') or at the growing number of private Arabic schools and publicly funded Franco-Arabic schools.\n\nSmall Roman Catholic communities are mainly found in coastal Serer, [[Jola people|Jola]], [[Mankanya people|Mankanya]] and Balant populations, and in eastern Senegal among the Bassari and Coniagui. The Protestant churches are mainly attended by immigrants but during the second half of the 20th century Protestant churches led by Senegalese leaders from different ethnic groups have evolved. In Dakar Catholic and Protestant rites are practiced by the Lebanese, Cape Verdean, European, and American immigrant populations, and among certain Africans of other countries as well as by the Senegalese themselves. Although Islam is Senegal's majority religion, Senegal's first president, [[L\u00e9opold S\u00e9dar Senghor]], was a Catholic Serer.\n\n[[Serer religion]] encompasses a belief in a supreme deity called [[Roog]] ([[Koox]] among the [[Cangin languages|Cangin]]), [[Serer creation myth|Serer cosmogony]], [[Religious cosmology|cosmology]] and [[divination]] ceremonies such as the annual ''[[Xooy]]'' (or ''Khoy'') ceremony precided over by the Serer [[Saltigue]]s (high priests and priestesses).

({{lang-fr|link=no|R\u00e9publique du S\u00e9n\u00e9gal}}; [[Wolof language|Wolof]]: R\u00e9ewum Senegaal), is a country in [[West Africa]]. Senegal is bordered by [[Mauritania]] in [[Mauritania\u2013Senegal border|the north]], [[Mali]] to [[Mali\u2013Senegal border|the east]], [[Guinea]] to [[Guinea\u2013Senegal border|the southeast]], and [[Guinea-Bissau]] to [[Guinea-Bissau\u2013Senegal border|the southwest]]. Senegal also [[Gambia\u2013Senegal border|surrounds]] [[The Gambia]], a country occupying a narrow sliver of land along the banks of the [[Gambia River]], which separates Senegal's southern region of [[Casamance]] from the rest of the country. Senegal also shares a maritime border with [[Cape Verde]]. Senegal's economic and political capital is [[Dakar]].\n\nIt is a [[Unitary state|unitary]] [[presidential system|presidential republic]] and is the westernmost country in the mainland of the [[Old World]], or [[Afro-Eurasia]].<ref>Janet H. Gritzner, Charles F. Gritzner \u2013 2009, Senegal \u2013 Page 8</ref> It owes its name to the [[Senegal River]] which borders it to the east and north. Senegal covers a land area of almost {{convert|197000|km2}} and has an population of around {{#expr:{{replace|{{UN_Population|Senegal}}|,||}}/1e6 round 0}} million.{{UN_Population|ref}} The climate is typically [[Sahel]]ian, though there is a [[Wet season|rainy season]].\n\n== Etymology ==\n\"Senegal\" is probably from a [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] transliteration of the name of the [[Zenaga language|Zenaga]] also known as the [[Sanhaja]],<ref name=fas>{{Cite web|url=https://theculturetrip.com/africa/senegal/articles/the-real-story-behind-senegals-name/|title=The Real Story Behind Senegal\u2019s Name|first=Beetle|last=Holloway|website=Culture Trip}}</ref> or a combination of the supreme deity in {{w|Serer religion}} (''Rog Sene'') and ''o gal'' meaning ''body of water'' in the [[Serer language]]. Alternatively, the name could derive from the [[Wolof language|Wolof]] phrase \"Sunuu Gaal,\" which means \"our boat.\"\n\n== Cultures and influences ==\n{{more citations needed section|date=January 2019}}\nThe territory of modern Senegal has been inhabited by various ethnic groups since [[prehistory]]. Organized kingdoms emerged around the seventh century, and parts of the country were ruled by prominent regional empires such as the [[Jolof Empire]]. The present state of Senegal has its roots in European colonialism, which began during the mid-15th century, when various European powers began competing for trade in the area. The establishment of coastal trading posts gradually led to control of the mainland, culminating in French rule of the area by the 19th century, albeit amid much local resistance. Senegal peacefully attained independence from France in 1960, and has since been among the more politically stable countries in Africa.\n\nSenegal's economy is centered mostly on commodities and natural resources. Major industries are fish processing, [[phosphate]] mining, fertilizer production, [[petroleum]] refining, construction materials, and ship construction and repair. As in most African nations, agriculture is a major sector, with Senegal producing several important cash crops, including [[peanut]]s, [[sugarcane]], [[cotton]], [[green bean]]s, [[tomato]]es, [[melon]]s, and [[mango]]es.<ref name=fas/> Owing to its relative stability, tourism and hospitality are also burgeoning sectors.\n\nWith it being a multiethnic and secular nation, Senegal is predominantly [[Sunni Islam|Sunni Muslim]] with [[Sufism|Sufi]] and [[traditional African religion|animist]] influences. French is the [[official language]], although many native languages are spoken and recognized. Since April 2012, Senegal's president has been [[Macky Sall]]. Senegal has been a member of the [[Organisation internationale de la Francophonie]] since 1970.\n\n==History==\n{{main|History of Senegal}}\n\n===Early and pre-colonial eras===\nArchaeological findings throughout the area indicate that Senegal was inhabited in prehistoric times and has been continuously occupied by various ethnic groups. Some kingdoms were created around the 7th century: [[Takrur]] in the 9th century, {{ILL|Namandiru|wo}} and the [[Jolof Empire]] during the 13th and 14th centuries. Eastern Senegal was once part of the [[Ghana Empire]].\n\nIslam was introduced through [[Toucouleur people|Toucouleur]] and [[Soninke people|Soninke]] contact with the [[Almoravid dynasty]] of the [[Maghreb]], who in turn propagated it with the help of the Almoravids, and Toucouleur allies. This movement faced resistance from ethnicities of traditional religions, the Serers in particular.<ref>Klein, Martin A., ''Islam and Imperialism in Senegal: Sine-Saloum, 1847\u20131914'', p. 7, Edinburgh University Press (1968) {{ISBN|0-8047-0621-2}}</ref><ref>[[Henry Gravrand|Gravrand, Henry]], ''La civilisation Sereer, Pangool,'' p. 13. Dakar, Nouvelles Editions Africaines (1990), {{ISBN|2-7236-1055-1}}</ref>\n\nIn the 13th and 14th centuries, the area came under the influence of the empires to the east; the Jolof Empire of Senegal was also founded during this time. In the Senegambia region, between 1300 and 1900, close to one-third of the population was [[Slavery in Africa|enslaved]], typically as a result of captives taken in warfare.<ref>[http://www.britannica.com/blackhistory/article-24157 \"Slavery\"], ''Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica's Guide to Black History'' {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141006131931/http://www.britannica.com/blackhistory/article-24157 |date=6 October 2014 }}</ref>\n\nIn the 14th century the Jolof Empire grew more powerful, having united [[Cayor]] and the kingdoms of [[Baol]], [[Kingdom of Sine|Sine]], [[Saloum]], [[Waalo]], [[Futa Tooro]] and [[Bambouk]], or much of present-day West Africa.

French and British diplomacy in the area were thrown into disarray.\n\n===Independence (1960)===\nOn 4 April 1959 Senegal and the [[French Sudan]] merged to form the [[Mali Federation]], which became fully independent on 20 June 1960, as a result of a transfer of power agreement signed with France on 4 April 1960. Due to internal political difficulties, the Federation broke up on 20 August, when Senegal and French Sudan (renamed the Republic of [[Mali]]) each proclaimed independence.\n\n[[L\u00e9opold S\u00e9dar Senghor]] was Senegal's first president in September 1960. Senghor was a very well-read man, educated in France. He was a poet and philosopher who personally drafted the Senegalese national anthem, \"Pincez tous vos koras, frappez les balafons\". Pro-African, he advocated a brand of African socialism.<ref>''A Critical bibliography of French literature: in three parts. The Twentieth.'' Edited by David Clark Cabeen, Richard A.

Former prime minister [[Mamadou Dia]], who was Senghor's rival, ran for election in 1983 against Diouf, but lost. Senghor moved to France, where he died at the age of 96.\n\nIn the 1980s, [[Boubacar Lam]] discovered Senegalese oral history that was initially compiled by the [[Toucouleur people|Tuculor]] noble, [[Yoro Dy\u00e2o]], not long after [[World War I]], which documented migrations into [[West Africa]] from the [[Nile Valley]]; ethnic groups, from the [[Senegal River]] to the [[Niger Delta]], retained traditions of having an eastern origin.<ref name=\"AfrAm\">{{cite book |last1=Gordon |first1=Jane |title=A Companion to African-American Studies |date=15 April 2008 |publisher=John Wiley & Sons |page=463 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ODmpx1fgJNIC&pg=PA463|isbn=978-1-4051-5466-6}}</ref>\n\nSenegal joined with [[The Gambia]] to form the nominal [[Senegambia Confederation]] on 1 February 1982. However, the union was dissolved in 1989. Despite peace talks, a southern separatist group ([[Movement of Democratic Forces of Casamance]] or MFDC) in the [[Casamance]] region has clashed sporadically with government forces since 1982 in the [[Casamance conflict]]. In the early 21st century, violence has subsided and President [[Macky Sall]] held talks with rebels in Rome in December 2012.<ref>[http://www.ucdp.uu.se/gpdatabase/gpcountry.php?id=135&regionSelect=2-Southern_Africa# \"[[Uppsala Conflict Data Program]]: Senegal: Casamance, In-depth Developments since 2005\"], ''Conflict Encyclopedia''</ref>\n\nAbdou Diouf was president between 1981 and 2000. He encouraged broader political participation, reduced government involvement in the economy, and widened Senegal's diplomatic engagements, particularly with other developing nations. Domestic politics on occasion spilled over into street violence, border tensions, and a violent separatist movement in the southern region of the Casamance. Nevertheless, Senegal's commitment to democracy and human rights strengthened. Abdou Diouf served four terms as president.\n\nIn the presidential election of 1999, opposition leader [[Abdoulaye Wade]] defeated Diouf in an election deemed free and fair by international observers. Senegal experienced its second peaceful transition of power, and its first from one political party to another. On 30 December 2004 President Wade announced that he would sign a peace treaty with the separatist group in the Casamance region. This, however, has yet to be implemented. There was a round of talks in 2005, but the results have not yet yielded a resolution.\n\n==Politics==\n{{main|Politics of Senegal}}\n[[File:Macky Sall - 2008.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Macky Sall]], President of Senegal (2012\u2013present)]]\n[[File:Abdoulaye Wade in 16-05-2007.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Abdoulaye Wade]], President of Senegal (2000\u20132012)]]\n\nSenegal is a [[republic]] with a presidency; the president is [[Elections in Senegal|elected]] every five years as of 2016, previously being seven years from independence to 2001, five years from 2001 to 2008, and 7 years again from 2008 to 2016,  by adult voters. The first president, [[L\u00e9opold S\u00e9dar Senghor]], was a poet and writer, and was the first African elected to the ''Acad\u00e9mie fran\u00e7aise''. Senegal's second president, [[Abdou Diouf]], later served as general secretary of the ''Organisation de la Francophonie''. The third president was [[Abdoulaye Wade]], a lawyer.

The nation's highest courts that deal with business issues are the constitutional council and the court of justice, members of which are named by the president.\n\n===Political culture===\nCurrently, Senegal has a quasi-democratic political culture, one of the more successful post-colonial democratic transitions in Africa. Local administrators are appointed and held accountable by the president. [[Marabout]]s, religious leaders of the various [[Muslim brotherhoods of Senegal]], have also exercised a strong political influence in the country especially during Wade's presidency.

Many of the ''Toucouleurs'', or sedentary Halpulaar of the Senegal River Valley in the north, converted to Islam around a millennium ago and later contributed to Islam's propagation throughout Senegal. Success was gained among the Wolofs, but repulsed by the Serers.\n\nMost communities south of the Senegal River Valley, however, were not thoroughly [[Islamization|Islamized]]. The Serer people stood out as one of this group, who spent over one thousand years resisting Islamization (see [[Serer history (medieval era to present)|Serer history]]). Although many Serers are Christians or Muslim, their conversion to Islam in particular is very recent, who converted on their own free will rather than by force, although force had been tried centuries earlier unsuccessfully (see [[the Battle of Fandane-Thiouthioune]]).<ref>{{cite book|author1=Hans Bressers|author2=Walter A.

In Murid communities, which place more emphasis on the work ethic than on literary Quranic studies, the term ''daara'' often applies to work groups devoted to working for a religious leader. Other Islamic groups include the much older Q\u0101diriyya order and the Senegalese [[Layene|Laayeen]] order, which is prominent among the coastal Lebu. Today, most Senegalese children study at ''daara''s for several years, memorizing as much of the Qur'an as they can. Some of them continue their religious studies at councils (''majlis'') or at the growing number of private Arabic schools and publicly funded Franco-Arabic schools.\n\nSmall Roman Catholic communities are mainly found in coastal Serer, [[Jola people|Jola]], [[Mankanya people|Mankanya]] and Balant populations, and in eastern Senegal among the Bassari and Coniagui. The Protestant churches are mainly attended by immigrants but during the second half of the 20th century Protestant churches led by Senegalese leaders from different ethnic groups have evolved. In Dakar Catholic and Protestant rites are practiced by the Lebanese, Cape Verdean, European, and American immigrant populations, and among certain Africans of other countries as well as by the Senegalese themselves.

According to one reading, the first of these three is named as ''Jashobeam'' instead. However, the [[Septuagint]] version of the same passage presents a name that scholars regard as clearly being a [[transliteration]] from ''Isbosheth''&mdash;the euphemism employed in some parts of the Bible for the name ''[[Ishbaal]]''. Hence the first member of The Three was possibly Ishbaal, [[Saul]]'s son and heir; the text having become corrupted either deliberately (e.g. due to an editor that sought to downplay Ishbaal's heroism) or accidentally.<ref>''[[Peake's Commentary on the Bible]]''</ref> According to other translations following the Masoretic text more closely, Jashobeam is the head of \"thirty\" or \"chief officers\" but not even part of the Three.\n\nIshbaal is described as being the leader and is said to have killed 800 men in a single encounter. Ishbaal is also described as a Tahkemonite, which is probably a corruption of ''[[Hacmonite]]'', the latter being how he is described by the Book of Chronicles. \n\nEleazar is described as standing his ground against the [[Philistines]] at [[Pas Dammim]] when the rest of the [[Hebrews]] ran away, and as successfully defeating them. Similarly Shammah is described as having stood his ground when the Philistines attacked a \"field of ripe lentils\" despite the rest of his associates dispersing, and as having defeated the attackers.\n\n==The Thirty==\nThe Thirty are not heavily described by the text, merely listed. There are several differences between the ancient manuscripts of the list, whether they are of the [[Masoretic]] text or of the [[Septuagint]]. Textual scholars generally consider the Septuagint to be more reliable than the Masoretic text in regard to this list, particularly since the Masoretic text of Chronicles matches the Septuagint version of the Books of Samuel more closely than the Masoretic version.<ref name=\"Peake's Commentary on the Bible\">''Peake's Commentary on the Bible''</ref> In addition there are a few places where it is uncertain whether one person is referred to or if it is two people. The individuals that are clearly identified are:\n*[[Elhanan son of Dodo]] from Bethlehem\n*[[Shammah]] from [[Arad, Israel|Arad]]\n*Helez from [[Beth-Palet]]\n*Ira son of Ikkesh from [[Tuqu'|Tekoa]]\n*[[Abiezer]] from [[Anathoth]]\n*a man from [[Hushah]] that was named either ''Mebunnai'' (according to the masoretic text) or was named ''Sibbecai'' (according to the Septuagint and Chronicles)\n*Zalmon, descended from [[Ahoah]]\n*Maharai from [[Umm Tuba|Netophah]]\n*Heleb<ref>a few manuscripts of the masoretic text read ''Heled'' rather than ''Heleb''</ref> son of Baanah from [[Umm Tuba|Netophah]]\n*Ithai son of Ribai from [[Gibeah]]\n*Benaiah from [[Pirathon]]\n*a man from the ravines of [[Mount Gaash|Gaash]] that was named ''Hiddai'' (according to the masoretic text) or was named ''Hurai'' (according to the Septuagint and Chronicles)\n*Abi-Albon from [[Beth-Arabah]]\n*Azmaveth from [[Bahurim]]\n*Eliahba from [[Shaalbim]]\n*the (unnamed) sons of a man that was either named ''Hashem'' and was from [[Gizon]] (according to the Septuagint and Chronicles) or was named 16. ''Jashen'' (according to the masoretic text)\n*[[Ahiam]] from [[Arad, Israel|Arad]], whose father was either named ''Sharar'' (according to the masoretic text) or was named ''Sacar'' (according to the Septuagint and Chronicles)\n*Eliphelet<ref>unlike the Books of Samuel, the Book of Chronicles names him as ''Eliphel''; this is near universally considered a [[typographic error]]</ref> from [[Maacah]], whose father was either named ''Ahasbai'' (according to the Books of Samuel) or ''Ur'' (according to Chronicles)\n*Eliam son of [[Ahithophel]] from [[Giloh]]\n*Hezro from [[Carmel (biblical settlement)|Carmel]]\n*Zelek from [[Ammon]]\n*Ira from [[Jattir]]\n*Gareb from Jattir\n*[[Uriah the Hittite]].\n\nIn addition to these, there are a few cases where an individual is named, and is then followed by a description that is unclear as to whether it refers to them, or whether it refers to an additional unnamed person:\n*Naharai from [[Beeroth (north)|Beeroth]], (and/who is) the armour-bearer of [[Joab]]\n*Igal son of Nathan from [[Zobah]], (and/who is) the son of a man named ''Hagri'' (according to the masoretic text and Chronicles) or ''Haggadi'' (according to the Septuagint).\n\nFor the remaining names of the list, there are some significant textual issues, the most minor of which being that the Books of Samuel lists ''Paarai the [[Archite|Arbite]]'' but the Book of Chronicles lists ''Naarai son of Exbai'' instead. The list in Samuel is generally presented in pairs, where each member of a pair comes from a similar location to the other member, but this pattern is broken by Shammah (from Arad), Elika (from Arad), and Helez (from Beth-Palet), who make a trio; in Chronicles, however, Elika isn't even listed.\n\nThe final name(s) on the list itself is/are given by the masoretic text as ''Jonathan son of Shammah from Arad'', but the septuagint has ''Jonathan, [and] Shammah from Arad''; the septuagint implies that the passage was understood to refer to a Jonathan significant enough to need no further qualification, thus probably referring to the Jonathan that elsewhere is described as a son of Saul&mdash;which Jonathan being a son of Shammah would contradict.\n\nAccording to textual scholars Jonathan is distinctly associated by other parts of the Books of Samuel with the [[Hebrews]], while Saul is distinctly associated with the [[Israelites]] (who the text consistently treats as a distinct group from the Hebrews), and his being Saul's son is considered by some textual scholars as more [[ethnology|ethnological]] than necessarily literal.<ref>Jewish Encyclopedia; ''Peake's Commentary on the Bible''</ref>{{Page needed|date=September 2010}}\n\nIt is more likely that this was ''Jonathan the son of Shemea, David\u2019s brother'' mentioned in [https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1+Chronicles+20%3A6-7&version=NIV 1 Chronicles 20:7] as having defeated a Philistine giant.\n\nAs the list is proceeded with ''...David put him in command of his bodyguard. Asahel, brother of Joab. Among the thirty were..... '', an [[Asahel]] the brother of [[Joab]] is sometimes considered to be part of the list, having become misplaced rather than the start of a lost passage.<ref>This varies between common English translations</ref>\n\n==Three of The Thirty==\nThe text also contains a narrative passage about \"three of The Thirty\". It is unclear from the text whether this refers to The Three, hence implying that The Three were a special group within The Thirty, or whether it refers to another group of three individuals. The narrative, which recounts a single exploit, ends with \"such were the exploits of the three mighty men\", and textual scholars believe that the narrative may be an extract from a larger group of tales concerning these three. The flowing narrative differs in style from the more abrupt introductions to individual members of The Three and The Thirty that surround it, and textual scholars believe that it may originally have been from a different document.<ref>Jewish Encyclopedia</ref>{{Page needed|date=September 2010}}\n[[File:Schnorr von Carolsfeld Bibel in Bildern 1860 106.png|thumb|right|250px|Woodcut of [[David]] pouring out the water, by [[Julius Schnorr von Carolsfeld]], 1860.]]\nIn the narrative, three of the thirty visit David when he is located at the [[cave of Adullam]]. While there, David expresses a heartfelt desire for water from a well near [[Bethlehem]], which the narrative states was occupied by Philistines. The three of the thirty therefore forcefully break past the Philistines, and draw water from the well, which they take back to David. David refuses to drink the water, instead pouring it out \"before [[Yahweh]]\", arguing that it was the ''blood'' of the men who had risked their lives. Biblical scholars argue that the description of David pouring out the water is a reference to David offering the water to Yahweh as a [[libation]].<ref name=\"Peake's Commentary on the Bible\"/>\n\n==Abishai==\nAn additional account, continuing on from the description of The Three, which was interrupted by the narrative concerning David's thirst, describes [[Abishai (Bible)|Abishai]], the brother of [[Joab]]. According to the text, he killed 300 men with a spear, and so became famous among The Thirty, though not as famous and respected as The Three. The text states that despite the fame and respect he was not included among The Three, suggesting that being a part of The Three is not just a group of famous people, but something which an individual could in some way gain membership, with criteria that involved more than fame and honour.\n\nAccording to most manuscripts of the masoretic text, Abishai became the commander of The Three, but according to the [[Syriac Peshitta]], and a few masoretic text manuscripts, Abishai instead became the commander of The Thirty. The text explicitly states that Abishai became the commander of The Three despite not being among them, but it is unclear whether this is directly because he was their commander (as with the masoretic text), or whether he was commander of The Thirty (as with the Septuagint) and The Three were a subgroup of The Thirty (as possibly implied by the narrative about \"three of The Thirty\").\n\n==Benaiah==\n[[Benaiah]] is singled out by the text for being a particularly great warrior, as famous as The Three, and significantly more respected than any of The Thirty, for which reason he was put in charge of the royal [[bodyguard]]. As with Abishai, the text emphasises that despite these qualities, Benaiah was not a member of The Three. The text gives a list of Benaiah's \"great exploits\", suggesting that these are what brought him fame and honour; compared with the feats ascribed by the text to Abishai, and to the members of The Three, Benaiah's feats are somewhat minor (though regarded by scholars as more realistic):\n*Killing two of [[Moab]]'s best warriors\n*Killing a [[lion]] in a pit on a [[snow]]y day\n*Attacking a 7 1/2 foot tall [[Ancient Egypt|Egypt]]ian with a [[Club (weapon)|club]], stealing the spear that the Egyptian was using, and killing the Egyptian with it.\n\n==See also==\n*[[Cherethites and Pelethites]]\n*[[English translations of the Bible]]\n*[[Septuagint]]\n*[[Masoretic text]]\n*[[Syriac Peshitta]]\n\n==References==\n<references />\n\n[[Category:Hebrew Bible people]]\n[[Category:David's Mighty Warriors| ]]\n[[Category:David]]\n[[Category:Books of Samuel]]\n", "text_old": "{{Redirect|Paarai|the 2003 film|Paarai (film)}}\n{{Infobox military unit\n|unit_name= [[Gibborim (biblical)|Gibborim]] ha-David''' <BR> \u05d4\u05b7\u05d2\u05b4\u05bc\u05d1\u05b9\u05bc\u05e8\u05b4\u059b\u05d9\u05dd\n|image=\n\n|caption=\n|start_date=1010 B.C.E\n|country= [[United Monarchy]]\n|branch= \n|type= [[Special operations force]], [[Shock troopers]]\n|role= Special operations, Infantry\n|size= 37\n|command_structure=\n|garrison=\n|garrison_label=\n|nickname= David\u2019s Mighty Warriors\n|allegiance=[[David]]\n|patron=\n|equipment= \n|equipment_label=\n|battles=\n|decorations=\n|battle_honours=\n|commander2=\n|commander2_label=\n|commander1=[[David]]\n|commander1_label=Founder & Commander\n|disbanded = 970 C.E\n<!-- Insignia -->\n|identification_symbol=\n|identification_symbol_label=\n| identification_symbol_2 = \n| identification_symbol_2_label = \n}}\n[[File:WWI memorial window, West Kirby Methodist Church.jpg|thumb|[[World War I]] memorial in [[West Kirby]] [[Methodist]] church; it depicts David and his three mighty men, and the quote \"Is not this the blood of men who went in jeopardy of their lives?\" ([[2 Samuel]] 23:17)]]\n'''David's Mighty Warriors''' (also known as '''David's Mighty Men''' or the '''Gibborim'''; {{Script/Hebrew|\u05d4\u05b7\u05d2\u05b4\u05bc\u05d1\u05b9\u05bc\u05e8\u05b4\u059b\u05d9\u05dd}} ''ha-Gibb\u014dr\u00eem'', \"The Mighty Ones\") are a group of 37 men in the [[Hebrew Bible]] who fought with [[King David]] and are identified in {{bibleverse|2|Samuel|23:8\u201338|NKJV}}, part of the \"supplementary information\" added to the [[Books of Samuel|Second Book of Samuel]] in its final four chapters.

According to one reading, the first of these three is named as ''Jashobeam'' instead. However, the [[Septuagint]] version of the same passage presents a name that scholars regard as clearly being a [[transliteration]] from ''Isbosheth''&mdash;the euphemism employed in some parts of the Bible for the name ''[[Ishbaal]]''. Hence the first member of The Three was possibly Ishbaal, [[Saul]]'s son and heir; the text having become corrupted either deliberately (e.g. due to an editor that sought to downplay Ishbaal's heroism) or accidentally.<ref>''[[Peake's Commentary on the Bible]]''</ref> According to other translations following the Masoretic text more closely, Jashobeam is the head of \"thirty\" or \"chief officers\" but not even part of the Three.\n\nIshbaal is described as being the leader and is said to have killed 800 men in a single encounter. Ishbaal is also described as a Tahkemonite, which is probably a corruption of ''[[Hacmonite]]'', the latter being how he is described by the Book of Chronicles. \n\nEleazar is described as standing his ground against the [[Philistines]] at [[Pas Dammim]] when the rest of the [[Hebrews]] ran away, and as successfully defeating them. Similarly Shammah is described as having stood his ground when the Philistines attacked a \"field of ripe lentils\" despite the rest of his associates dispersing, and as having defeated the attackers.\n\n==The Thirty==\nThe Thirty are not heavily described by the text, merely listed. There are several differences between the ancient manuscripts of the list, whether they are of the [[Masoretic]] text or of the [[Septuagint]]. Textual scholars generally consider the Septuagint to be more reliable than the Masoretic text in regard to this list, particularly since the Masoretic text of Chronicles matches the Septuagint version of the Books of Samuel more closely than the Masoretic version.<ref name=\"Peake's Commentary on the Bible\">''Peake's Commentary on the Bible''</ref> In addition there are a few places where it is uncertain whether one person is referred to or if it is two people. The individuals that are clearly identified are:\n*[[Elhanan son of Dodo]] from Bethlehem\n*[[Shammah]] from [[Arad, Israel|Arad]]\n*Helez from [[Beth-Palet]]\n*Ira son of Ikkesh from [[Tuqu'|Tekoa]]\n*[[Abiezer]] from [[Anathoth]]\n*a man from [[Hushah]] that was named either ''Mebunnai'' (according to the masoretic text) or was named ''Sibbecai'' (according to the Septuagint and Chronicles)\n*Zalmon, descended from [[Ahoah]]\n*Maharai from [[Umm Tuba|Netophah]]\n*Heleb<ref>a few manuscripts of the masoretic text read ''Heled'' rather than ''Heleb''</ref> son of Baanah from [[Umm Tuba|Netophah]]\n*Ithai son of Ribai from [[Gibeah]]\n*Benaiah from [[Pirathon]]\n*a man from the ravines of [[Mount Gaash|Gaash]] that was named ''Hiddai'' (according to the masoretic text) or was named ''Hurai'' (according to the Septuagint and Chronicles)\n*Abi-Albon from [[Beth-Arabah]]\n*Azmaveth from [[Bahurim]]\n*Eliahba from [[Shaalbim]]\n*the (unnamed) sons of a man that was either named ''Hashem'' and was from [[Gizon]] (according to the Septuagint and Chronicles) or was named 16. ''Jashen'' (according to the masoretic text)\n*[[Ahiam]] from [[Arad, Israel|Arad]], whose father was either named ''Sharar'' (according to the masoretic text) or was named ''Sacar'' (according to the Septuagint and Chronicles)\n*Eliphelet<ref>unlike the Books of Samuel, the Book of Chronicles names him as ''Eliphel''; this is near universally considered a [[typographic error]]</ref> from [[Maacah]], whose father was either named ''Ahasbai'' (according to the Books of Samuel) or ''Ur'' (according to Chronicles)\n*Eliam son of [[Ahithophel]] from [[Giloh]]\n*Hezro from [[Carmel (biblical settlement)|Carmel]]\n*Zelek from [[Ammon]]\n*Ira from [[Jattir]]\n*Gareb from Jattir\n*[[Uriah the Hittite]].\n\nIn addition to these, there are a few cases where an individual is named, and is then followed by a description that is unclear as to whether it refers to them, or whether it refers to an additional unnamed person:\n*Naharai from [[Beeroth (north)|Beeroth]], (and/who is) the armour-bearer of [[Joab]]\n*Igal son of Nathan from [[Zobah]], (and/who is) the son of a man named ''Hagri'' (according to the masoretic text and Chronicles) or ''Haggadi'' (according to the Septuagint).\n\nFor the remaining names of the list, there are some significant textual issues, the most minor of which being that the Books of Samuel lists ''Paarai the [[Archite|Arbite]]'' but the Book of Chronicles lists ''Naarai son of Exbai'' instead. The list in Samuel is generally presented in pairs, where each member of a pair comes from a similar location to the other member, but this pattern is broken by Shammah (from Arad), Elika (from Arad), and Helez (from Beth-Palet), who make a trio; in Chronicles, however, Elika isn't even listed.\n\nThe final name(s) on the list itself is/are given by the masoretic text as ''Jonathan son of Shammah from Arad'', but the septuagint has ''Jonathan, [and] Shammah from Arad''; the septuagint implies that the passage was understood to refer to a Jonathan significant enough to need no further qualification, thus probably referring to the Jonathan that elsewhere is described as a son of Saul&mdash;which Jonathan being a son of Shammah would contradict.\n\nAccording to textual scholars Jonathan is distinctly associated by other parts of the Books of Samuel with the [[Hebrews]], while Saul is distinctly associated with the [[Israelites]] (who the text consistently treats as a distinct group from the Hebrews), and his being Saul's son is considered by some textual scholars as more [[ethnology|ethnological]] than necessarily literal.<ref>Jewish Encyclopedia; ''Peake's Commentary on the Bible''</ref>{{Page needed|date=September 2010}}\n\nIt is more likely that this was ''Jonathan the son of Shemea, David\u2019s brother'' mentioned in [https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1+Chronicles+20%3A6-7&version=NIV 1 Chronicles 20:7] as having defeated a Philistine giant.\n\nAs the list is proceeded with ''...David put him in command of his bodyguard. Asahel, brother of Joab. Among the thirty were..... '', an [[Asahel]] the brother of [[Joab]] is sometimes considered to be part of the list, having become misplaced rather than the start of a lost passage.<ref>This varies between common English translations</ref>\n\n==Three of The Thirty==\nThe text also contains a narrative passage about \"three of The Thirty\". It is unclear from the text whether this refers to The Three, hence implying that The Three were a special group within The Thirty, or whether it refers to another group of three individuals. The narrative, which recounts a single exploit, ends with \"such were the exploits of the three mighty men\", and textual scholars believe that the narrative may be an extract from a larger group of tales concerning these three. The flowing narrative differs in style from the more abrupt introductions to individual members of The Three and The Thirty that surround it, and textual scholars believe that it may originally have been from a different document.<ref>Jewish Encyclopedia</ref>{{Page needed|date=September 2010}}\n[[File:Schnorr von Carolsfeld Bibel in Bildern 1860 106.png|thumb|right|250px|Woodcut of [[David]] pouring out the water, by [[Julius Schnorr von Carolsfeld]], 1860.]]\nIn the narrative, three of the thirty visit David when he is located at the [[cave of Adullam]]. While there, David expresses a heartfelt desire for water from a well near [[Bethlehem]], which the narrative states was occupied by Philistines. The three of the thirty therefore forcefully break past the Philistines, and draw water from the well, which they take back to David. David refuses to drink the water, instead pouring it out \"before [[Yahweh]]\", arguing that it was the ''blood'' of the men who had risked their lives. Biblical scholars argue that the description of David pouring out the water is a reference to David offering the water to Yahweh as a [[libation]].<ref name=\"Peake's Commentary on the Bible\"/>\n\n==Abishai==\nAn additional account, continuing on from the description of The Three, which was interrupted by the narrative concerning David's thirst, describes [[Abishai (Bible)|Abishai]], the brother of [[Joab]]. According to the text, he killed 300 men with a spear, and so became famous among The Thirty, though not as famous and respected as The Three. The text states that despite the fame and respect he was not included among The Three, suggesting that being a part of The Three is not just a group of famous people, but something which an individual could in some way gain membership, with criteria that involved more than fame and honour.\n\nAccording to most manuscripts of the masoretic text, Abishai became the commander of The Three, but according to the [[Syriac Peshitta]], and a few masoretic text manuscripts, Abishai instead became the commander of The Thirty. The text explicitly states that Abishai became the commander of The Three despite not being among them, but it is unclear whether this is directly because he was their commander (as with the masoretic text), or whether he was commander of The Thirty (as with the Septuagint) and The Three were a subgroup of The Thirty (as possibly implied by the narrative about \"three of The Thirty\").\n\n==Benaiah==\n[[Benaiah]] is singled out by the text for being a particularly great warrior, as famous as The Three, and significantly more respected than any of The Thirty, for which reason he was put in charge of the royal [[bodyguard]]. As with Abishai, the text emphasises that despite these qualities, Benaiah was not a member of The Three. The text gives a list of Benaiah's \"great exploits\", suggesting that these are what brought him fame and honour; compared with the feats ascribed by the text to Abishai, and to the members of The Three, Benaiah's feats are somewhat minor (though regarded by scholars as more realistic):\n*Killing two of [[Moab]]'s best warriors\n*Killing a [[lion]] in a pit on a [[snow]]y day\n*Attacking a 7 1/2 foot tall [[Ancient Egypt|Egypt]]ian with a [[Club (weapon)|club]], stealing the spear that the Egyptian was using, and killing the Egyptian with it.\n\n==See also==\n*[[Cherethites and Pelethites]]\n*[[English translations of the Bible]]\n*[[Septuagint]]\n*[[Masoretic text]]\n*[[Syriac Peshitta]]\n\n==References==\n<references />\n\n[[Category:Hebrew Bible people]]\n[[Category:David's Mighty Warriors| ]]\n[[Category:David]]\n[[Category:Books of Samuel]]\n", "name_user": "Cnwilliams", "label": "safe", "comment": "Disambiguated:Shock troopers\u2192Shock troops", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David%27s_Mighty_Warriors"}

It was established in 1981 as \"[[Technikon]] Free State\". As part of the South African government's restructuring of tertiary education for the new millennium it was promoted to university of technology status.\n==About CUT==\nThe university (then still known as the \u201cTechnikon Free State\u201d) opened its doors in 1981, with 285 students enrolled in mainly secretarial, art and design programmes.  Today, the institution boasts more than 21 000 students who have decided to make CUT their academic partner in earning a qualification and gaining appropriate work-integrated learning to equip and prepare them for professional practice. With the restructuring of the higher education landscape in 2004, CUT embraced its new status as a university of technology (UoT), positioning itself to succeed as such.   The qualifications on offer reside in four faculties, namely Faculty of Health and Environmental Sciences; Faculty of Humanities; Faculty of Engineering, Built Environment and Information Technology (IT); and Faculty of Management Sciences.  The university offers certificates and diplomas at undergraduate level, as well as advanced diplomas, postgraduate diplomas at honours level, and master\u2019s and doctoral degrees in order to increase the production of world-class postgraduate programmes and high-quality outputs for research.\n\nCUT\u2019s vision is to be \u201can engaged university that focuses on producing quality social and technological innovations for socio-economic development, primarily in the Central region of South Africa\u201d. This vision has four pillars, namely planning, products, people and pennies, each describing an important aspect of the university\u2019s future. It does not come as a surprise, then, that Management, staff and students have formulated a strategic vision for the future that is all about heart. They call it the\n\u201cVision 2020 Statement\u201d, and within it are ideas and goals that are supported and inspired by the university across all platforms and programmes. It represents the university\u2019s aspirations and determination as a UoT, and has allowed the university to contribute substantively to addressing the developmental needs of the Free State, the Central region, South Africa and the continent.\n\nThe university\u2019s goal is to be a leader in areas of social and technological innovations and research. CUT believes that no successful geographical region has ever established a technology-based industry without a leading educational institution in its midst, and the university wants to become this institution. In this lies the strength of the planning pillar, which outlines the step-by-step implementation and review of the main practices and outcomes of Vision 2020.\n\n===Campuses===\nCUT is the foremost higher education institution in the heartland of South Africa. The university has two campuses \u2013 one in Bloemfontein, the judicial capital of South Africa, and one in Welkom, in the heart of the Free State goldfields.

As part of the South African government's restructuring of tertiary education for the new millennium it was promoted to university of technology status.\n==About CUT==\nThe university (then still known as the \u201cTechnikon Free State\u201d) opened its doors in 1981, with 285 students enrolled in mainly secretarial, art and design programmes.  Today, the institution boasts more than 21 000 students who have decided to make CUT their academic partner in earning a qualification and gaining appropriate work-integrated learning to equip and prepare them for professional practice. With the restructuring of the higher education landscape in 2004, CUT embraced its new status as a university of technology (UoT), positioning itself to succeed as such.   The qualifications on offer reside in four faculties, namely Faculty of Health and Environmental Sciences; Faculty of Humanities; Faculty of Engineering, Built Environment and Information Technology (IT); and Faculty of Management Sciences.  The university offers certificates and diplomas at undergraduate level, as well as advanced diplomas, postgraduate diplomas at honours level, and master\u2019s and doctoral degrees in order to increase the production of world-class postgraduate programmes and high-quality outputs for research.\n\nCUT\u2019s vision is to be \u201can engaged university that focuses on producing quality social and technological innovations for socio-economic development, primarily in the Central region of South Africa\u201d. This vision has four pillars, namely planning, products, people and pennies, each describing an important aspect of the university\u2019s future. It does not come as a surprise, then, that Management, staff and students have formulated a strategic vision for the future that is all about heart. They call it the\n\u201cVision 2020 Statement\u201d, and within it are ideas and goals that are supported and inspired by the university across all platforms and programmes. It represents the university\u2019s aspirations and determination as a UoT, and has allowed the university to contribute substantively to addressing the developmental needs of the Free State, the Central region, South Africa and the continent.\n\nThe university\u2019s goal is to be a leader in areas of social and technological innovations and research. CUT believes that no successful geographical region has ever established a technology-based industry without a leading educational institution in its midst, and the university wants to become this institution. In this lies the strength of the planning pillar, which outlines the step-by-step implementation and review of the main practices and outcomes of Vision 2020.\n\n===Campuses===\nCUT is the foremost higher education institution in the heartland of South Africa. The university has two campuses \u2013 one in Bloemfontein, the judicial capital of South Africa, and one in Welkom, in the heart of the Free State goldfields. The two campuses offer education opportunities in a number of technological fields, including science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM); management sciences; humanities; and education.<ref name=\"auto\">https://www.cut.ac.za/cut-at-a-glance</ref>\n\n===Faculties===\n* [https://www.cut.ac.za/faculty/faculty-of-engineering-information-technology Faculty of Engineering, Built Environment and Information Technology]\n* [https://www.cut.ac.za/faculty/health-and-environmental-sciences Faculty of Health and Environmental Sciences]\n* [https://www.cut.ac.za/faculty/humanities Faculty of Humanities]\n* [https://www.cut.ac.za/faculty/management-sciences Faculty of Management Sciences]\n\n===Student enrollment===\nThe Central University of Technology offers contact and distance learning. In 2007, it had 10,278 contact students and 200 distance students. There were 8,474 full-time and 2,004 part-time students. Of the student body, 9,902 were South African citizens, while 532 were from other SADC countries and 44 were international students from countries other than the SADC.<ref name=\"auto\"/>\n\n==References==\n\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n{{South African universities}} {{FNB Varsity Cup}} \n\n{{coord|29|07|17|S|26|12|49|E|region:ZA-FS_type:landmark_source:kolossus-dewiki|display=title}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Central University Of Technology}}\n[[Category:Public universities in South Africa]]\n[[Category:Universities in the Free State (province)]]\n[[Category:Educational institutions established in 1981]]\n\n{{SouthAfrica-university-stub}}\n", "name_user": "Leandra.jordaan", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eStudent enrollment:The student numbers are outdated.

Othello orders a general celebration and leaves to consummate his marriage with Desdemona. In his absence, Iago gets Cassio drunk, and then persuades Roderigo to draw Cassio into a fight. Montano tries to calm down an angry and drunk Cassio and this leads to them fighting one another. Montano is injured in the fight. Othello reenters and questions the men as to what happened. Othello blames Cassio for the disturbance and strips him of his rank. Cassio is distraught. Iago persuades Cassio to ask Desdemona to persuade her husband to reinstate him.\n\n===Act III===\nIago now persuades Othello to be suspicious of Cassio and Desdemona. When Desdemona drops a [[handkerchief]] (the first gift given to her by Othello), Emilia finds it, and gives it to her husband Iago, at his request, unaware of what he plans to do with it. Othello reenters and, then being convinced by Iago of his wife\u2019s unfaithfulness with his captain, vows with Iago for the death of Desdemona and Cassio, after which he makes Iago his lieutenant. Act III, scene iii is considered to be the turning point of the play as it is the scene in which Iago successfully sows the seeds of doubt in Othello's mind, inevitably sealing Othello's fate.\n\n===Act IV===\nIago plants the handkerchief in Cassio's lodgings, then tells Othello to watch Cassio's reactions while Iago questions him. Iago goads Cassio on to talk about his affair with Bianca, a local courtesan, but whispers her name so quietly that Othello believes the two men are talking about Desdemona. Later, Bianca accuses Cassio of giving her a second-hand gift which he had received from another lover. Othello sees this, and Iago convinces him that Cassio received the handkerchief from Desdemona.\n\nEnraged and hurt, Othello resolves to kill his wife and tells Iago to kill Cassio. Othello proceeds to make Desdemona's life miserable and strikes her in front of visiting Venetian nobles. Meanwhile, Roderigo complains that he has received no results from Iago in return for his money and efforts to win Desdemona, but Iago convinces him to kill Cassio.\n\n===Act V===\n[[File:Othello's Lamentation.jpg|thumb|left|Painting by [[William Salter (artist)|William Salter]] of Othello weeping over Desdemona's body. Oil on canvas, ca. 1857.]]Roderigo, having been manipulated by Iago, attacks Cassio in the street after Cassio leaves Bianca's lodgings. Cassio wounds Roderigo. During the scuffle, Iago comes from behind Cassio and badly cuts his leg. In the darkness, Iago manages to hide his identity, and when Lodovico and Gratiano hear Cassio's cries for help, Iago joins them. When Cassio identifies Roderigo as one of his attackers, Iago secretly stabs Roderigo to stop him revealing the plot. Iago then accuses Bianca of the failed conspiracy to kill Cassio.\n\nOthello confronts Desdemona, and then [[Strangling|strangles]] her in their bed. When Emilia arrives, Desdemona defends her husband before dying, and Othello accuses Desdemona of adultery. Emilia calls for help. The former governor Montano arrives, with Gratiano and Iago. When Othello mentions the handkerchief as proof, Emilia realizes what her husband Iago has done, and she exposes him, whereupon he kills her. Othello, belatedly realising Desdemona's innocence, stabs Iago but not fatally, saying that Iago is a devil, and he would rather have him live the rest of his life in pain.\n\nIago refuses to explain his motives, vowing to remain silent from that moment on. Lodovico apprehends both Iago and Othello for the murders of Roderigo, Emilia, and Desdemona, but Othello commits suicide. Lodovico appoints Cassio as Othello's successor and exhorts him to punish Iago justly. He then denounces Iago for his actions and leaves to tell the others what has happened.\n\n==Sources==\n''Othello'' is an adaptation of the Italian writer [[Giovanni Battista Giraldi|Cinthio]]'s tale \"Un Capitano Moro\" (\"A Moorish Captain\") from his ''Gli Hecatommithi'' (1565), a collection of one hundred tales in the style of [[Giovanni Boccaccio]]'s ''[[Decameron]].'' No English translation of Cinthio was available in Shakespeare's lifetime, and verbal echoes in ''Othello'' are closer to the Italian original than to [[Gabriel Chappuy]]'s 1584 French translation. Cinthio's tale may have been based on an actual incident occurring in Venice about 1508.<ref name=\"4trag\">Shakespeare, William. ''Four Tragedies: Hamlet, Othello, King Lear, Macbeth''. Bantam Books, 1988.</ref> It also resembles an incident described in the earlier tale of \"[[The Three Apples]]\", one of the stories narrated in the ''[[One Thousand and One Nights]]'' (''Arabian Nights'').<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Young|first=John G., M.D.|title=Essay: What Is Creativity?|journal=Adventures in Creativity: Multimedia Magazine|volume=1|issue=2|url=http://www.adventuresincreativity.net/2mag1.html|accessdate=17 October 2008|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080820111333/http://www.adventuresincreativity.net/2mag1.html|archivedate=20 August 2008}}</ref> Desdemona is the only named character in Cinthio's tale, with his few other characters identified only as the \"[[Moors|Moor]]\", the \"Squadron Leader\", the \"Ensign\", and the \"Ensign's Wife\" (corresponding to the play's Othello, Cassio, Iago and Emilia). Cinthio drew a moral (which he placed in the mouth of Desdemona) that it is unwise for European women to marry the temperamental men of other nations.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.virgil.org/dswo/courses/shakespeare-survey/cinthio.pdf |title=Virgil.org |format=PDF |accessdate=18 August 2013}}</ref> Cinthio's tale has been described as a \"partly racist warning\" about the dangers of [[miscegenation]].<ref>[[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare, William]].

Brabantio, Roderigo, and several minor characters are not found in Cinthio, for example, and Shakespeare's Emilia takes part in the handkerchief mischief while her counterpart in Cinthio does not. Unlike in ''Othello'', in Cinthio, the \"Ensign\" (the play's Iago) lusts after Desdemona and is spurred to revenge when she rejects him. Shakespeare's opening scenes are unique to his tragedy, as is the tender scene between Emilia and Desdemona as the lady prepares for bed. Shakespeare's most striking departure from Cinthio is the manner of his heroine's death. In Shakespeare, Othello suffocates Desdemona, but in Cinthio, the \"Moor\" commissions the \"Ensign\" to bludgeon his wife to death with a sand-filled stocking. Cinthio describes each gruesome blow, and, when the lady is dead, the \"Ensign\" and the \"Moor\" place her lifeless body upon her bed, smash her skull, and cause the cracked ceiling above the bed to collapse upon her, giving the impression its falling rafters caused her death. In Cinthio, the two murderers escape detection. The \"Moor\" then misses Desdemona greatly, and comes to loathe the sight of the \"Ensign\". He demotes him, and refuses to have him in his company. The \"Ensign\" then seeks revenge by disclosing to the \"Squadron Leader\" the \"Moor's\" involvement in Desdemona's death. The two depart Cyprus for Venice, and denounce the \"Moor\" to the Venetian Seigniory; he is arrested, taken to Venice, and tortured. He refuses to admit his guilt and is condemned to exile. Desdemona's relatives eventually find and kill him. The \"Ensign\", however, continues to escape detection in Desdemona's death, but engages in other crimes while in Venice. He is arrested and dies after being tortured. Cinthio's \"Ensign's Wife\" (the play's Emilia), survives her husband's death to tell her story.<ref>Bevington, David and Bevington, Kate (translators). \"Un Capitano Moro\" in ''Four Tragedies: Hamlet, Othello, King Lear, Macbeth''.

However, the version in the Folio is rather different in length, and in wording: as the editors of the Folger edition explain: \"The Folio play has about 160 lines that do not appear in the Quarto. Some of these cluster together in quite extensive passages. The Folio also lacks a scattering of about a dozen lines or part-lines that are to be found in the Quarto. These two versions also differ from each other in their readings of numerous words.<ref name=\"Barbara Mowat 1993\">Paul Westine and Barbara Mowat, eds.

Throughout the play, good-natured characters make rash decisions based on the jealousy that they feel, most notably Othello.\n\nIn the early acts, Othello is depicted as a typical heroic figure and holds admirable qualities, written with the intention of winning over the favour of the audience; however, as the play goes on, jealousy will manipulate his decisions and lead him into sin. While the majority of the evil that Othello carries out in the play can be cited as coming from Iago, it is jealousy that motivates him to perform wicked deeds. When Iago highlights the almost excessive amount of time that Cassio and his wife, Desdemona, are spending together, Othello becomes filled with rage and, following a series of events, will murder the one that he loves.\n\nShakespeare explores man's ugliest trait in this opus and perfectly represents the idea of the 'tragic hero' in Othello, who wins over the responders early on but proceeds to make bad, almost wicked, decisions that will make it harder for the audience to like him until his eventual undoing. This idea of the tragic hero is made clear through the utilisation of jealousy, one of the various notable themes present in ''Othello''.\n\n===Iago versus Othello===\nAlthough its title suggests that the tragedy belongs primarily to Othello, Iago plays an important role in the plot. He reflects the archetypal villain and has the biggest share of the dialogue. In ''Othello'', it is Iago who manipulates all other characters at will, controlling their movements and trapping them in an intricate net of lies. He achieves this by getting close to all characters and playing on their weaknesses while they refer to him as \"honest\" Iago, thus furthering his control over the characters. [[A. C. Bradley]], and more recently [[Harold Bloom]], have been major advocates of this interpretation.<ref>{{cite book |last=Shakespeare |first=William |author2=Ruffiel, Burton |others=Bloom, Harold |title=Othello (Yale Shakespeare) |publisher=Yale University Press |year=2005 |origyear= |isbn=0-300-10807-9 |url=https://archive.org/details/othello100shak }}</ref> Other critics, most notably in the later twentieth century (after [[F.

[[E. A. J. Honigmann]], the editor of the [[Arden Shakespeare]] edition, concluded that Othello's race is ambiguous. \"Renaissance representations of the Moor were vague, varied, inconsistent, and contradictory. As critics have established, the term 'Moor' referred to dark-skinned people in general, used interchangeably with terms such as 'African', 'Somali', 'Ethiopian', 'Negro', 'Arab', 'Berber', and even 'Indian' to designate a figure from Africa (or beyond).\"<ref>''Making More of the Moor: Aaron, Othello, and Renaissance Refashionings of Race''. Emily C. Bartels</ref><ref>\"Moor, n2\", ''The Oxford English Dictionary'', 2nd edtn.</ref> Various uses of the word ''black'' (for example, \"Haply for I am black\") are insufficient evidence for any accurate racial classification, Honigmann argues, since ''black'' could simply mean ''swarthy'' to Elizabethans. Iago twice uses the word ''Barbary'' or ''Barbarian'' to refer to Othello, seemingly referring to the [[Barbary]] coast inhabited by [[Berber people|Berbers]]. Roderigo calls Othello \"the thicklips\", which seems to refer to Sub-Saharan African physiognomy, but Honigmann counters that, as these comments are all intended as insults by the characters, they need not be taken literally.<ref>[[E.

But questions of race may not boil down to a simple decision of casting a single role. In 1979, [[Keith Fowler]]\u2019s production of ''Othello'' mixed the races throughout the company.  Produced by the [[Richmond, Virginia|American Revels Company]] at the Empire Theater (renamed the November Theater in 2011) in Richmond, Virginia, this production starred African American actor Clayton Corbin in the title role, with Henry K.

When [[Edwin Booth]]'s tour of England in 1880 was not well attended, [[Henry Irving]] invited Booth to alternate the roles of Othello and Iago with him in London.

Roderigo is upset because he loves Desdemona and had asked her father, Brabantio, for her hand in marriage.\n\nIago hates Othello for promoting a younger man named Cassio above him, whom Iago considers a less capable soldier than himself, and tells Roderigo that he plans to exploit Othello for his own advantage. Iago convinces Roderigo to wake Brabantio and tell him about his daughter's [[elopement]]. Meanwhile, Iago sneaks away to find Othello and warns him that Brabantio is coming for him. When Brabantio finds out, he is angered, but after hearing Desdemona speak they allow the marriage because it was done out of her own will and not forced. Shortly after, Othello is told that he needs to leave Cyprus to fight the Ottomans. \n\nBrabantio, provoked by Roderigo, is enraged and will not rest until he has confronted Othello, but he finds Othello's residence full of the Duke of Venice's guards, who prevent violence. News has arrived in Venice that the [[Ottoman Empire|Turks]] [[Ottoman\u2013Venetian Wars|are going to attack]] [[Cyprus]], and Othello is therefore summoned to advise the senators. Brabantio has no option but to accompany Othello to the Duke's residence, where he accuses Othello of seducing Desdemona by [[witchcraft]].\n\nOthello defends himself before the [[Doge|Duke of Venice]], Brabantio's kinsmen Lodovico and Gratiano, and various senators. Othello explains that Desdemona became enamoured of him for the sad and compelling stories he told of his life before Venice, not because of any witchcraft. The senate is satisfied, once Desdemona confirms that she loves Othello, but Brabantio leaves saying that Desdemona will betray Othello: \"Look to her, Moor, if thou hast eyes to see:/She has deceived her father, and may thee,\" (Act I, Sc 3). Iago, still in the room, takes note of Brabantio's remark. By order of the Duke, Othello leaves Venice to command the Venetian armies against invading Turks on the island of [[Cyprus]], accompanied by his new wife, his new lieutenant Cassio, his ensign Iago, and Iago's wife, Emilia, as Desdemona's attendant.\n\n===Act II===\nThe party arrives in Cyprus to find that a storm has destroyed the Turkish fleet. Othello orders a general celebration and leaves to consummate his marriage with Desdemona. In his absence, Iago gets Cassio drunk, and then persuades Roderigo to draw Cassio into a fight. Montano tries to calm down an angry and drunk Cassio and this leads to them fighting one another. Montano is injured in the fight. Othello reenters and questions the men as to what happened. Othello blames Cassio for the disturbance and strips him of his rank. Cassio is distraught. Iago persuades Cassio to ask Desdemona to persuade her husband to reinstate him.\n\n===Act III===\nIago now persuades Othello to be suspicious of Cassio and Desdemona. When Desdemona drops a [[handkerchief]] (the first gift given to her by Othello), Emilia finds it, and gives it to her husband Iago, at his request, unaware of what he plans to do with it. Othello reenters and, then being convinced by Iago of his wife\u2019s unfaithfulness with his captain, vows with Iago for the death of Desdemona and Cassio, after which he makes Iago his lieutenant. Act III, scene iii is considered to be the turning point of the play as it is the scene in which Iago successfully sows the seeds of doubt in Othello's mind, inevitably sealing Othello's fate.\n\n===Act IV===\nIago plants the handkerchief in Cassio's lodgings, then tells Othello to watch Cassio's reactions while Iago questions him. Iago goads Cassio on to talk about his affair with Bianca, a local courtesan, but whispers her name so quietly that Othello believes the two men are talking about Desdemona. Later, Bianca accuses Cassio of giving her a second-hand gift which he had received from another lover. Othello sees this, and Iago convinces him that Cassio received the handkerchief from Desdemona.\n\nEnraged and hurt, Othello resolves to kill his wife and tells Iago to kill Cassio. Othello proceeds to make Desdemona's life miserable and strikes her in front of visiting Venetian nobles. Meanwhile, Roderigo complains that he has received no results from Iago in return for his money and efforts to win Desdemona, but Iago convinces him to kill Cassio.\n\n===Act V===\n[[File:Othello's Lamentation.jpg|thumb|left|Painting by [[William Salter (artist)|William Salter]] of Othello weeping over Desdemona's body. Oil on canvas, ca. 1857.]]Roderigo, having been manipulated by Iago, attacks Cassio in the street after Cassio leaves Bianca's lodgings. Cassio wounds Roderigo. During the scuffle, Iago comes from behind Cassio and badly cuts his leg. In the darkness, Iago manages to hide his identity, and when Lodovico and Gratiano hear Cassio's cries for help, Iago joins them. When Cassio identifies Roderigo as one of his attackers, Iago secretly stabs Roderigo to stop him revealing the plot. Iago then accuses Bianca of the failed conspiracy to kill Cassio.\n\nOthello confronts Desdemona, and then [[Strangling|strangles]] her in their bed. When Emilia arrives, Desdemona defends her husband before dying, and Othello accuses Desdemona of adultery. Emilia calls for help. The former governor Montano arrives, with Gratiano and Iago. When Othello mentions the handkerchief as proof, Emilia realizes what her husband Iago has done, and she exposes him, whereupon he kills her. Othello, belatedly realising Desdemona's innocence, stabs Iago but not fatally, saying that Iago is a devil, and he would rather have him live the rest of his life in pain.\n\nIago refuses to explain his motives, vowing to remain silent from that moment on. Lodovico apprehends both Iago and Othello for the murders of Roderigo, Emilia, and Desdemona, but Othello commits suicide. Lodovico appoints Cassio as Othello's successor and exhorts him to punish Iago justly. He then denounces Iago for his actions and leaves to tell the others what has happened.\n\n==Sources==\n''Othello'' is an adaptation of the Italian writer [[Giovanni Battista Giraldi|Cinthio]]'s tale \"Un Capitano Moro\" (\"A Moorish Captain\") from his ''Gli Hecatommithi'' (1565), a collection of one hundred tales in the style of [[Giovanni Boccaccio]]'s ''[[Decameron]].'' No English translation of Cinthio was available in Shakespeare's lifetime, and verbal echoes in ''Othello'' are closer to the Italian original than to [[Gabriel Chappuy]]'s 1584 French translation. Cinthio's tale may have been based on an actual incident occurring in Venice about 1508.<ref name=\"4trag\">Shakespeare, William. ''Four Tragedies: Hamlet, Othello, King Lear, Macbeth''. Bantam Books, 1988.</ref> It also resembles an incident described in the earlier tale of \"[[The Three Apples]]\", one of the stories narrated in the ''[[One Thousand and One Nights]]'' (''Arabian Nights'').<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Young|first=John G., M.D.|title=Essay: What Is Creativity?|journal=Adventures in Creativity: Multimedia Magazine|volume=1|issue=2|url=http://www.adventuresincreativity.net/2mag1.html|accessdate=17 October 2008|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080820111333/http://www.adventuresincreativity.net/2mag1.html|archivedate=20 August 2008}}</ref> Desdemona is the only named character in Cinthio's tale, with his few other characters identified only as the \"[[Moors|Moor]]\", the \"Squadron Leader\", the \"Ensign\", and the \"Ensign's Wife\" (corresponding to the play's Othello, Cassio, Iago and Emilia). Cinthio drew a moral (which he placed in the mouth of Desdemona) that it is unwise for European women to marry the temperamental men of other nations.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.virgil.org/dswo/courses/shakespeare-survey/cinthio.pdf |title=Virgil.org |format=PDF |accessdate=18 August 2013}}</ref> Cinthio's tale has been described as a \"partly racist warning\" about the dangers of [[miscegenation]].<ref>[[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare, William]].

Retrieved from [[Google Books]] on 5 November 2010. {{ISBN|1-85326-018-5|978-1-85326-018-6}}.</ref>\n\nWhile Shakespeare closely followed Cinthio's tale in composing ''Othello'', he departed from it in some details. Brabantio, Roderigo, and several minor characters are not found in Cinthio, for example, and Shakespeare's Emilia takes part in the handkerchief mischief while her counterpart in Cinthio does not. Unlike in ''Othello'', in Cinthio, the \"Ensign\" (the play's Iago) lusts after Desdemona and is spurred to revenge when she rejects him. Shakespeare's opening scenes are unique to his tragedy, as is the tender scene between Emilia and Desdemona as the lady prepares for bed. Shakespeare's most striking departure from Cinthio is the manner of his heroine's death. In Shakespeare, Othello suffocates Desdemona, but in Cinthio, the \"Moor\" commissions the \"Ensign\" to bludgeon his wife to death with a sand-filled stocking. Cinthio describes each gruesome blow, and, when the lady is dead, the \"Ensign\" and the \"Moor\" place her lifeless body upon her bed, smash her skull, and cause the cracked ceiling above the bed to collapse upon her, giving the impression its falling rafters caused her death. In Cinthio, the two murderers escape detection. The \"Moor\" then misses Desdemona greatly, and comes to loathe the sight of the \"Ensign\". He demotes him, and refuses to have him in his company. The \"Ensign\" then seeks revenge by disclosing to the \"Squadron Leader\" the \"Moor's\" involvement in Desdemona's death. The two depart Cyprus for Venice, and denounce the \"Moor\" to the Venetian Seigniory; he is arrested, taken to Venice, and tortured. He refuses to admit his guilt and is condemned to exile. Desdemona's relatives eventually find and kill him. The \"Ensign\", however, continues to escape detection in Desdemona's death, but engages in other crimes while in Venice. He is arrested and dies after being tortured. Cinthio's \"Ensign's Wife\" (the play's Emilia), survives her husband's death to tell her story.<ref>Bevington, David and Bevington, Kate (translators). \"Un Capitano Moro\" in ''Four Tragedies: Hamlet, Othello, King Lear, Macbeth''.

However, the version in the Folio is rather different in length, and in wording: as the editors of the Folger edition explain: \"The Folio play has about 160 lines that do not appear in the Quarto. Some of these cluster together in quite extensive passages. The Folio also lacks a scattering of about a dozen lines or part-lines that are to be found in the Quarto. These two versions also differ from each other in their readings of numerous words.<ref name=\"Barbara Mowat 1993\">Paul Westine and Barbara Mowat, eds.

Throughout the play, good-natured characters make rash decisions based on the jealousy that they feel, most notably Othello.\n\nIn the early acts, Othello is depicted as a typical heroic figure and holds admirable qualities, written with the intention of winning over the favour of the audience; however, as the play goes on, jealousy will manipulate his decisions and lead him into sin. While the majority of the evil that Othello carries out in the play can be cited as coming from Iago, it is jealousy that motivates him to perform wicked deeds. When Iago highlights the almost excessive amount of time that Cassio and his wife, Desdemona, are spending together, Othello becomes filled with rage and, following a series of events, will murder the one that he loves.\n\nShakespeare explores man's ugliest trait in this opus and perfectly represents the idea of the 'tragic hero' in Othello, who wins over the responders early on but proceeds to make bad, almost wicked, decisions that will make it harder for the audience to like him until his eventual undoing. This idea of the tragic hero is made clear through the utilisation of jealousy, one of the various notable themes present in ''Othello''.\n\n===Iago versus Othello===\nAlthough its title suggests that the tragedy belongs primarily to Othello, Iago plays an important role in the plot. He reflects the archetypal villain and has the biggest share of the dialogue. In ''Othello'', it is Iago who manipulates all other characters at will, controlling their movements and trapping them in an intricate net of lies. He achieves this by getting close to all characters and playing on their weaknesses while they refer to him as \"honest\" Iago, thus furthering his control over the characters. [[A. C. Bradley]], and more recently [[Harold Bloom]], have been major advocates of this interpretation.<ref>{{cite book |last=Shakespeare |first=William |author2=Ruffiel, Burton |others=Bloom, Harold |title=Othello (Yale Shakespeare) |publisher=Yale University Press |year=2005 |origyear= |isbn=0-300-10807-9 |url=https://archive.org/details/othello100shak }}</ref> Other critics, most notably in the later twentieth century (after [[F.

[[E. A. J. Honigmann]], the editor of the [[Arden Shakespeare]] edition, concluded that Othello's race is ambiguous. \"Renaissance representations of the Moor were vague, varied, inconsistent, and contradictory. As critics have established, the term 'Moor' referred to dark-skinned people in general, used interchangeably with terms such as 'African', 'Somali', 'Ethiopian', 'Negro', 'Arab', 'Berber', and even 'Indian' to designate a figure from Africa (or beyond).\"<ref>''Making More of the Moor: Aaron, Othello, and Renaissance Refashionings of Race''. Emily C. Bartels</ref><ref>\"Moor, n2\", ''The Oxford English Dictionary'', 2nd edtn.</ref> Various uses of the word ''black'' (for example, \"Haply for I am black\") are insufficient evidence for any accurate racial classification, Honigmann argues, since ''black'' could simply mean ''swarthy'' to Elizabethans. Iago twice uses the word ''Barbary'' or ''Barbarian'' to refer to Othello, seemingly referring to the [[Barbary]] coast inhabited by [[Berber people|Berbers]]. Roderigo calls Othello \"the thicklips\", which seems to refer to Sub-Saharan African physiognomy, but Honigmann counters that, as these comments are all intended as insults by the characters, they need not be taken literally.<ref>[[E.

But questions of race may not boil down to a simple decision of casting a single role. In 1979, [[Keith Fowler]]\u2019s production of ''Othello'' mixed the races throughout the company.  Produced by the [[Richmond, Virginia|American Revels Company]] at the Empire Theater (renamed the November Theater in 2011) in Richmond, Virginia, this production starred African American actor Clayton Corbin in the title role, with Henry K.

This table can be sorted to display [[List of Prime Ministers of the United Kingdom|prime ministers of the United Kingdom]] by name, order of office, date of birth, age at appointment, length of retirement, or lifespan. Age at appointment is determined by the day a prime minister assumed office for the first time. Length of retirement is determined from the day a prime minister leaves office for the final time until their death.\n\nTwo measures of longevity are given; this is to allow for the differing number of [[leap day]]s occurring within the life of each Prime Minister. The first figure is the number of days between date of birth and date of death, allowing for leap days; in parentheses the same period given in years and days, with the number of whole years that the Prime Minister had lived, and the days being the remaining number of days from their last birthday. Where the prime minister in question is still living, their longevity is measured up to {{FULLDATE|type=dmy}}.\n <!-- [[Wikipedia:Close paraphrasing]] - A BIT TOO CLOSE STILL --\"The first figure is the number of days between date of birth and date of death, allowing for leap days; in parentheses the same period given in years and days, with the years being the number of whole years the Vice President lived, and the days being the remaining number of days after his last birthday.

[[Harold Macmillan]] was the second-longest-lived, 42 days short of Callaghan. The shortest-lived prime minister, [[William Cavendish, 4th Duke of Devonshire|Duke of Devonshire]], was 44 years and 147 days old when he died on 2 October 1764.\n\nThe prime minister with the longest retirement is [[Augustus FitzRoy, 3rd Duke of Grafton|Duke of Grafton]], at 41 years and 45 days. He achieved this record on 1 January 1799, surpassing [[John Stuart, 3rd Earl of Bute|Earl of Bute]], who died 28 years, 337 days after leaving office. Bute held the record for nearly 22 years. The longest retirement any prime minister since Grafton has held is that of [[Henry Addington]], who left office on 10 May 1804 and died 39 years and 281 days later on 15 February 1844. Of the five former prime ministers currently alive, [[John Major]] has been retired the longest, with a retirement of {{ayd|1997|5|2}} having left office on 2 May 1997.

The more coiled the hair texture, the higher its shrinkage.\n\nAn individual hair's shape is never completely circular. The cross-section of a hair is an [[ellipse]], which can tend towards a circle or be distinctly flattened. Asiatic heads of straight hair are formed from almost-round hairs, and Caucasian hair's cross sections form oval shapes. Afro-textured hair has a flattened cross-section and is finer, and its ringlets can form tight circles with diameters of only a few [[millimeter]]s. In humans worldwide, Asiatic hair is the most common, whereas afro-textured hair is the least common. This is because the former hair texture is typical of the large populations inhabiting [[East Asia]] as well as the [[indigenous peoples of the Americas]].<ref name=\"L'Or\u00e9al Hair Science\">{{cite web|url=http://www.hair-science.com |title=Hair Science |publisher=Hair Science |date=2005-02-01 |accessdate=2012-06-20 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20040825062529/http://www.hair-science.com/ |archivedate=2004-08-25 }}</ref>\n\nAfro-textured hair strands can possess \"torsion twists\", where the hair strand turns around itself.

Robbins 2012 p. 181\">Clarence R. Robbins, ''Chemical, Weird and Physical Behavior of Human Hair'' (2012), p. 181, {{ISBN|3642256112}}</ref> With regard to the hypothesized [[recent African origin of modern humans]], the author argues that afro-textured hair was the original hair texture of all modern humans prior to the \"Out-of-Africa\" migration that populated the rest of the globe.<ref name=\"Clarence R. Robbins 2012 p. 181\"/>\n\nAccording to Clarence (2012), afro-textured hair may have been adaptive for the earliest modern humans in Africa because the relatively sparse density of such hair, combined with its elastic helix shape, results in an airy effect. The resulting increased circulation of cool air onto the scalp may have thus served to facilitate the [[thermoregulation|body-temperature-regulation system]] of hominids while they lived on the open [[savannah]].<ref name=\"Clarence R. Robbins 2012 p. 181\"/> Afro-hair requires more moisture than straight hair and tends to shrink when dry. Instead of sticking to the neck and scalp when damp (as do straighter textures), unless completely drenched it tends to retain its basic springiness. The trait may have been retained and/or preferred among many anatomically modern populations in equatorial areas, such as [[Polynesians]], [[Demographics of the Federated States of Micronesia|Micronesians]], [[Melanesians]], [[Australoids]] and the [[Negrito]], because of its contribution to enhanced comfort levels under [[tropical climate]] conditions.<ref name=\"Clarence R. Robbins 2012 p. 181\"/>\n\n==History==\n\n===Continental Africa===\nHistorically, many cultures in continental Africa developed hairstyles that defined status, or identity, in regards to age, ethnicity, wealth, social rank, marital status, religion, fertility, adulthood, and death. Hair was carefully groomed by those who understood the aesthetic standard, as the social implications of hair grooming were a significant part of community life. Dense, thick, clean, and neatly groomed hair was something highly admired and sought after. Hair groomers possessed unique styling skills, allowing them to create a variety of designs that met the local cultural standards. Hair was usually dressed according to local culture.\n\nIn many traditional cultures, communal grooming was a social event when a woman could socialize and strengthen bonds between herself, other women and their families. Historically, hair [[braiding]] was not a paid trade. Since the [[African diaspora]], in the 20th and 21st centuries it has developed as a multimillion-dollar business in such regions as the United States, South Africa and western Europe. An individual's hair groomer was usually someone whom they knew closely. Sessions can include shampooing, oiling, combing, braiding and twisting, plus adding accessories.\n\nFor shampooing, [[black soap]] was widely used in nations in [[West Africa|West]] and [[Central Africa]].

During the approximately 400&nbsp;years of the [[Atlantic slave trade|Trans-Atlantic slave trade]], which extracted over 20&nbsp;million people from West and Central Africa, their beauty ideals have undergone numerous changes.\n\nAfricans captured as slaves no longer had the sort of resources to practice hair grooming that they had had when home. The enslaved Africans adapted as best they could under the circumstances, finding sheep-fleece [[carding]] tools particularly useful for detangling their hair. They suffered from scalp diseases and [[Pediculosis|infestations]] due to their living conditions. Enslaved people used varying remedies for [[disinfectant|disinfecting]] and cleansing their scalps, such as applying [[kerosene]] or [[cornmeal]] directly on the scalp with a cloth as they carefully parted the hair. Enslaved field hands often shaved their hair and wore hats to protect their scalps against the sun. [[House slave]]s had to appear tidy and well-groomed. The men sometimes wore [[powdered wig|wigs]] mimicking their masters', or similar hairstyles, while the women typically plaited or [[braid]]ed their hair. During the 19th century, hair styling, especially among women, became more popular. Cooking grease such as [[lard]], [[butter]] and [[schmaltz|goose grease]], were used to moisturize the hair. Women sometimes used hot [[butter knife|butterknives]] to curl their hair.<ref>{{Cite web|url = http://scholarworks.gsu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1095&context=art_design_theses|title = Hair Matters: African American Women and the Natural Hair Aesthetic|accessdate = 2015-06-07|website = ScholarWorks @ Georgia State University|publisher = Georgia State University|last = Hargro|first = Brina}}</ref>\n\nBecause of the then-prevalent notion that straight hair was more acceptable than kinky hair, many black people began exploring solutions for [[hair straightening|straightening]], or relaxing, their tresses. One post-slavery solution was a mixture of [[lye]], egg and potato, which [[chemical burn|burned]] the scalp upon contact.\n\n====Politics of Black hair====\nIn 1960s United States, natural afro-textured hair was transformed from a simple expression of style into a revolutionary political statement. It became a fundamental tool of the [[Black Power|Black movement]] in America, and \"[h]air came to symbolize either a continued move toward integration in the American political system or a growing cry for Black power and [[Black nationalism|nationalism]].\"<ref name=\"Tharps&Byrd2002\">{{cite book|last1=Tharps|first1=Lori|last2=Byrd|first2=Ayana|title=Hair Story: Untangling the Roots of Black Hair in America|url=https://archive.org/details/isbn_9780312283223|url-access=registration|date=Jan 12, 2002|publisher=St. Martin's Griffin|location=New York}}</ref>{{rp|51}} Prior to this, the idealized Black person (especially Black women) \"had many [[Eurocentric]] features, including hairstyles.\"<ref name=\"Tharps&Byrd2002\"/>{{rp|29}} However, during [[civil rights movement|the movement]], the Black community endeavoured to define their own ideals and beauty standards, and hair became a central icon which was \"promoted as a way of challenging mainstream standards regarding hair\".<ref name=\"Banks 2000\">{{cite book|last=Banks|first=Ingrid|title=Hair Matters: Beauty, Power, and Black Women's Consciousness|url=https://archive.org/details/isbn_9780814713372|url-access=registration|date=Oct 1, 2000|publisher=NYU Press|location=New York}}</ref>{{rp|35}} During this time, afro-textured hair \"was at its height of politicization\", and wearing an Afro was an easily distinguishable physical expression of [[Black pride]] and the rejection of societal norms.<ref name=\"Banks 2000\"/>{{rp|43}} [[Jesse Jackson]], a political activist, says that \"the way [he] wore [his] hair was an expression of the rebellion of the time\".<ref name=\"Tharps&Byrd2002\"/>{{rp|55}} Black activists infused straightened hair with political valence; straightening one's hair in an attempt to 'simulate Whiteness', whether chemically or with the use of heat, came to be seen by some as an act of self-hatred and a sign of [[internalized oppression]] imposed by White-dominated [[mainstream media]].\n\nAt this time, an African-American person's \"ability to conform to mainstream standards of beauty [was] tied to being successful.\"<ref name=\"Tharps&Byrd2002\"/>{{rp|148}} Thus, rejecting straightened hair symbolized a deeper act of rejecting the belief that straightening hair and other forms of grooming which were deemed 'socially acceptable' were the only means of looking presentable and attaining success in society. The pressing comb and chemical straighteners became stigmatized within the community as symbols of oppression and imposed White beauty ideals. Certain Black people sought to embrace beauty and affirm and accept their natural physical traits. One of the ultimate goals of the Black movement was to evolve to a level where Black people \"were proud of black skin and kinky or nappy hair. As a result, natural hair became a symbol of that pride.\"<ref name=\"Tharps&Byrd2002\"/>{{rp|43}} Negative perceptions of afro-textured hair and beauty had been passed down through the generations, so they had become ingrained in Black mentality to the point where they had been accepted as [[conventional wisdom|simple truths]]. Wearing natural hair was seen as a progressive statement, and for all the support that the movement gathered, there were many who opposed natural hair both for its aesthetics and the ideology that it promoted. It caused tensions between the Black and White communities, as well as discomfort amongst more conservative African-Americans.\n\nThe style of afro-textured hair continues to be politicized in contemporary society. \"These issues of style are highly charged as sensitive questions about [an individual's] very 'identity'.\"<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">Mercer, Kobena. \"Black hair/style politics\". ''New Formations 3''. Winter (1987).</ref>{{rp|34}} Whether an individual decides to wear their hair in its natural state or alter it, all Black hairstyles convey a message.

''New Formations 3''. Winter (1987): 33\u201356.</ref>{{rp|36}} This value system is reinforced by the systematic [[racism]] that was, and still is, often hidden from the public eye in Western society. Racism 'works' by encouraging the devaluation of self-identity by the victims themselves, and that re-centering of a sense of pride is a [[prerequisite]] for a politics of resistance and reconstruction.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>{{rp|36}}\n\nIn this system, \"hair functions as a key 'ethnic signifier' because, compared with bodily shape or facial features, it can be changed more easily by cultural practices such as straightening.\"<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>{{rp|36}} Racism originally \"'politicized' [afro-textured] hair by burdening it with a range of negative social and [[psychological]] 'meanings'\"\u2014categorizing it as a problem.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>{{rp|37}} Ethnic difference that could be easily manipulated, like hair, was altered in order for ethnic minorities to [[cultural assimilation|assimilate]] into a dominant, Eurocentric society. Natural hairstyles, such as the [[Afro]] and [[dreadlocks]], \"counter-politicized the signifier of ethnic devalorization, redefining Blackness as a positive attribute\".<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/> By wearing their hair as it naturally grows, individuals with afro-textured hair were taking back [[Agency (sociology)|agency]] in deciding the value and politics of their own hair. Wearing one's hair naturally also opens up a new debate: Are those who decide to still wear their hair straightened, for example, less 'Black' or 'proud' of their heritage, than those who decide to wear their hair naturally? This debate is an often-ongoing topic of discussion within the community. The issue is highly debated and disputed, creating almost a social divide within the community between those who decide to be natural and those who do not.\n\n====Emancipation and post-Civil War====\nAfter the [[American Civil War]] and [[abolitionism in the United States|emancipation]], many African-Americans migrated to larger towns or cities, where they were influenced by new styles. The photos below show 19th-century women leaders with a variety of styles with natural hair. Others straightened their hair to conform to White beauty ideals. They wanted to succeed, and to avoid mistreatment including legal and social discrimination. Some women, and a smaller number of men, lightened their hair with household [[bleach]]. A variety of caustic products that contained bleaches, including laundry bleach, designed to be applied to afro-textured hair, were developed in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, as African Americans demanded more fashion options. They used creams and lotions, combined with hot irons, to straighten their hair.\n\nThe Black hair care industry was initially dominated by White-owned businesses. In the late 19th century, African-American entrepreneurs such as [[Annie Malone|Annie Turnbo Malone]], [[Madam C. J. Walker]], Madam Gold S.M. Young, Sara Spencer Washington and [[Garrett Augustus Morgan]] revolutionized hair care by inventing and marketing chemical (and heat-based) applications to alter the natural tightly curled texture. They rapidly became successful and dominated the Black hair care market. In 1898, [[Anthony Overton]] founded a hair care company that offered saponified coconut shampoo and AIDA hair [[pomade]]. Men began using pomades, among other products, to achieve the standard aesthetic look.\n\nDuring the 1930s, [[conk]]ing (vividly described in ''[[The Autobiography of Malcolm X]]'') became an innovative method in the U.S. for Black men to straighten their kinky hair. Women at that time tended either to wear wigs, or to hot-comb their hair (rather than conk it) in order to temporarily mimic a straight style without permanently altering the natural curl pattern. Popular until the 1960s, the conk hair style was achieved through the application of a painful [[lye]], egg and potato mixture that was toxic and immediately [[chemical burn|burned]] the scalp.\n\nBlack-owned businesses in the hair-care industry provided jobs for thousands of African-Americans. These business owners gave back strongly to the African-American community.<ref>Edmondson, V., & Carroll, A. (1999). Giving Back: An Examination of the Philanthropic Motivations, Orientations and Activities of Large Black-Owned Businesses. Journal of Business Ethics, 19(2), 171-179. Retrieved from http://www.jstor.org/stable/25074086</ref> During this time, hundreds of African-Americans became owner-operators of successful [[beauty salon]]s and [[barber]]shops. These offered [[perm (hairstyle)|permanents]] and [[hair-straightening]], as well as cutting and styling services, some to both White and Black clients. In this era, men regularly went to barber shops to have their beards groomed, and some Black barbers developed exclusively White, elite clientele, sometimes in association with hotels or clubs. Media images tended to perpetuate the ideals of European beauty of the majority culture, even when featuring African-Americans.\n\nAfrican-Americans began sponsoring their own [[beauty contest|beauty events]]. The winners, many of whom wore straight hair styles and some of whom were of [[mixed race]], adorned [[Black press|Black magazines]] and product [[advertisement]]s. In the early 20th century, media portrayal of traditional African hair styles, such as braids and cornrows, was associated with African-Americans who were poor and lived in [[rural area]]s. In the early decades of the [[Great Migration (African American)|Great Migration]], when millions of African Americans left the [[Southern United States|South]] for opportunities in [[Northeastern United States|northern]] and [[midwest]]ern industrial cities, many African Americans wanted to leave this rural association behind.<ref name=\"culturalhistory\">{{cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/encyclopediaofha0000sher|url-access=registration|page=[https://archive.org/details/encyclopediaofha0000sher/page/17 17]|quote=+slaves +scalp.|title=Encyclopedia of Hair: A Cultural History|accessdate=2011-05-22|author=Victoria Sherrow|year=2006|publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group|isbn=978-0-313-33145-9}}</ref>\n<!-- Please do not modify rows. -->\n<gallery class=\"center\">\nFile:Cerca 1850 African American woman.jpg|African-American woman wearing styled textured hair.

Some believe that slaves and later African-Americans absorbed prejudices of the European slaveholders and colonizers, who considered most slaves as [[second-class citizen|second-class]], as they were not citizens.

Slavery played a major role in the ups and downs of the pride that African-Americans take in their hair. \"Everything I knew about American history I learned from looking at Black people's hair. It's the perfect metaphor for the African experiment here: the price of the ticket (for a journey no one elected to take), the toll of slavery, and the costs remaining. It's all in the hair.

Natural hair [[blog]]s include Black Girl Long Hair (BGLH), Curly Nikki and Afro Hair Club. With the emergence of [[hip-hop]] culture and Jamaican influences like [[reggae]] music, more non-Black people have begun to wear these hairstyles as well. A new market has developed in such hair products as \"Out of Africa\" shampoo.\n\nThe popularity of natural hair has waxed and waned. In the early 21st century, a significant percentage of African-American women still straighten their hair with relaxers of some kind (either heat- or chemical-based). This is done despite the fact that prolonged application of such chemicals (or heat) can result in overprocessing, breakage and thinning of the hair. Rooks (1996) argues that hair-care products designed to straighten hair, which have been marketed by white-owned companies in African American publications since the 1830s, represent unrealistic and unattainable standards of beauty.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Hair raising : beauty, culture, and African American women|last=Rooks|first=Noliwe M.|date=1996|page=13|publisher=Rutgers University Press|isbn=9780585098272|location=New Brunswick, N.J.|oclc=44964950|url=https://www.google.com/books?id=lCQbqC3lQnEC&pg=PA13#v=onepage&q&f=false}}</ref>\n\nSales of relaxers took a great fall among African-American women from 2010 to 2015.

Though this expression of identity has been joyful for the community, it is not celebrated as much in American culture. There have been numerous events in history that have shown disapproval of Black hair styles, some of which have transcended into present day. Black hairstyles that are straight and more reserved seem to be the more accepted styles. Other hair styles may face scrutiny due to their vast difference to the White beauty idealistic hair. The idea of accommodating this White beauty ideal has a strong presence in everyday life, but more specifically the workplace.\n\nIn 1971 [[Melba Tolliver]], a [[WABC-TV]] correspondent, made national headlines when she wore an [[Afro]] while covering the wedding of [[Tricia Nixon Cox]], daughter of President [[Richard Nixon]].

Stacia begins her story describing her \u201cBig Chop\u201d, a phrase used to indicate cutting off the relaxed or processed hair. A couple months after her big chop, she entered the Job market and she became very nervous about how her hair would appear to job interviewers. Luckily, none of the interviewers acknowledged her hair in a discriminating way. Stacia later discussed the first appearance of \u201cthe bush\u201d in being a political statement and related it to her situation, worried that her hair could be seen as a \"professional liability\". Then she made a comparison between her natural hair, which is easier to style, and her relaxed hair, which is more accepted.

The Afro has a number of variants including \"[[afro puffs]]\" (a cross between an Afro and [[pigtails]]) and a variant in which the Afro is treated with a [[blow dryer]] to become a flowing mane.

In humans worldwide, Asiatic hair is the most common, whereas afro-textured hair is the least common. This is because the former hair texture is typical of the large populations inhabiting [[East Asia]] as well as the [[indigenous peoples of the Americas]].<ref name=\"L'Or\u00e9al Hair Science\">{{cite web|url=http://www.hair-science.com |title=Hair Science |publisher=Hair Science |date=2005-02-01 |accessdate=2012-06-20 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20040825062529/http://www.hair-science.com/ |archivedate=2004-08-25 }}</ref>\n\nAfro-textured hair strands can possess \"torsion twists\", where the hair strand turns around itself. These torsion twists may prevent the hair strands from coiling into tight curls, instead separating them and allowing the hair as a whole to have a fluffier, more undefined look.<ref name=\"The Natural Haven\">{{cite web|author=Jc|url=http://thenaturalhaven.blogspot.com/|title=The Natural Haven|publisher=Thenaturalhaven.blogspot.com|accessdate=2012-06-20}}</ref>\n\n==Evolution==\n{{main|Hair#Texture}}\n[[File:Friends2.jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|[[Papuan people|Papuan]] women]]\nClarence (2012) suggests that afro-textured hair may have initially evolved because of an adaptive need amongst humans' early [[hominid]] ancestors for protection against the intense [[UV]] [[radiation]] of the sun in Africa.<ref name=\"Clarence R. Robbins 2012 p. 181\">Clarence R. Robbins, ''Chemical, Weird and Physical Behavior of Human Hair'' (2012), p. 181, {{ISBN|3642256112}}</ref> With regard to the hypothesized [[recent African origin of modern humans]], the author argues that afro-textured hair was the original hair texture of all modern humans prior to the \"Out-of-Africa\" migration that populated the rest of the globe.<ref name=\"Clarence R. Robbins 2012 p. 181\"/>\n\nAccording to Clarence (2012), afro-textured hair may have been adaptive for the earliest modern humans in Africa because the relatively sparse density of such hair, combined with its elastic helix shape, results in an airy effect. The resulting increased circulation of cool air onto the scalp may have thus served to facilitate the [[thermoregulation|body-temperature-regulation system]] of hominids while they lived on the open [[savannah]].<ref name=\"Clarence R. Robbins 2012 p. 181\"/> Afro-hair requires more moisture than straight hair and tends to shrink when dry. Instead of sticking to the neck and scalp when damp (as do straighter textures), unless completely drenched it tends to retain its basic springiness. The trait may have been retained and/or preferred among many anatomically modern populations in equatorial areas, such as [[Polynesians]], [[Demographics of the Federated States of Micronesia|Micronesians]], [[Melanesians]], [[Australoids]] and the [[Negrito]], because of its contribution to enhanced comfort levels under [[tropical climate]] conditions.<ref name=\"Clarence R. Robbins 2012 p. 181\"/>\n\n==History==\n\n===Continental Africa===\nHistorically, many cultures in continental Africa developed hairstyles that defined status, or identity, in regards to age, ethnicity, wealth, social rank, marital status, religion, fertility, adulthood, and death. Hair was carefully groomed by those who understood the aesthetic standard, as the social implications of hair grooming were a significant part of community life. Dense, thick, clean, and neatly groomed hair was something highly admired and sought after. Hair groomers possessed unique styling skills, allowing them to create a variety of designs that met the local cultural standards. Hair was usually dressed according to local culture.\n\nIn many traditional cultures, communal grooming was a social event when a woman could socialize and strengthen bonds between herself, other women and their families. Historically, hair [[braiding]] was not a paid trade. Since the [[African diaspora]], in the 20th and 21st centuries it has developed as a multimillion-dollar business in such regions as the United States, South Africa and western Europe. An individual's hair groomer was usually someone whom they knew closely. Sessions can include shampooing, oiling, combing, braiding and twisting, plus adding accessories.\n\nFor shampooing, [[black soap]] was widely used in nations in [[West Africa|West]] and [[Central Africa]]. Additionally, [[palm oil]] and [[palm kernel oil]] were popularly used for oiling the scalp. [[Shea butter]] has traditionally been used to moisturize and dress the hair.\n<!-- Please do not modify rows.

During the approximately 400&nbsp;years of the [[Atlantic slave trade|Trans-Atlantic slave trade]], which extracted over 20&nbsp;million people from West and Central Africa, their beauty ideals have undergone numerous changes.\n\nAfricans captured as slaves no longer had the sort of resources to practice hair grooming that they had had when home. The enslaved Africans adapted as best they could under the circumstances, finding sheep-fleece [[carding]] tools particularly useful for detangling their hair. They suffered from scalp diseases and [[Pediculosis|infestations]] due to their living conditions. Enslaved people used varying remedies for [[disinfectant|disinfecting]] and cleansing their scalps, such as applying [[kerosene]] or [[cornmeal]] directly on the scalp with a cloth as they carefully parted the hair. Enslaved field hands often shaved their hair and wore hats to protect their scalps against the sun. [[House slave]]s had to appear tidy and well-groomed. The men sometimes wore [[powdered wig|wigs]] mimicking their masters', or similar hairstyles, while the women typically plaited or [[braid]]ed their hair. During the 19th century, hair styling, especially among women, became more popular. Cooking grease such as [[lard]], [[butter]] and [[schmaltz|goose grease]], were used to moisturize the hair. Women sometimes used hot [[butter knife|butterknives]] to curl their hair.<ref>{{Cite web|url = http://scholarworks.gsu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1095&context=art_design_theses|title = Hair Matters: African American Women and the Natural Hair Aesthetic|accessdate = 2015-06-07|website = ScholarWorks @ Georgia State University|publisher = Georgia State University|last = Hargro|first = Brina}}</ref>\n\nBecause of the then-prevalent notion that straight hair was more acceptable than kinky hair, many black people began exploring solutions for [[hair straightening|straightening]], or relaxing, their tresses. One post-slavery solution was a mixture of [[lye]], egg and potato, which [[chemical burn|burned]] the scalp upon contact.\n\n====Politics of Black hair====\nIn 1960s United States, natural afro-textured hair was transformed from a simple expression of style into a revolutionary political statement. It became a fundamental tool of the [[Black Power|Black movement]] in America, and \"[h]air came to symbolize either a continued move toward integration in the American political system or a growing cry for Black power and [[Black nationalism|nationalism]].\"<ref name=\"Tharps&Byrd2002\">{{cite book|last1=Tharps|first1=Lori|last2=Byrd|first2=Ayana|title=Hair Story: Untangling the Roots of Black Hair in America|url=https://archive.org/details/isbn_9780312283223|url-access=registration|date=Jan 12, 2002|publisher=St. Martin's Griffin|location=New York}}</ref>{{rp|51}} Prior to this, the idealized Black person (especially Black women) \"had many [[Eurocentric]] features, including hairstyles.\"<ref name=\"Tharps&Byrd2002\"/>{{rp|29}} However, during [[civil rights movement|the movement]], the Black community endeavoured to define their own ideals and beauty standards, and hair became a central icon which was \"promoted as a way of challenging mainstream standards regarding hair\".<ref name=\"Banks 2000\">{{cite book|last=Banks|first=Ingrid|title=Hair Matters: Beauty, Power, and Black Women's Consciousness|url=https://archive.org/details/isbn_9780814713372|url-access=registration|date=Oct 1, 2000|publisher=NYU Press|location=New York}}</ref>{{rp|35}} During this time, afro-textured hair \"was at its height of politicization\", and wearing an Afro was an easily distinguishable physical expression of [[Black pride]] and the rejection of societal norms.<ref name=\"Banks 2000\"/>{{rp|43}} [[Jesse Jackson]], a political activist, says that \"the way [he] wore [his] hair was an expression of the rebellion of the time\".<ref name=\"Tharps&Byrd2002\"/>{{rp|55}} Black activists infused straightened hair with political valence; straightening one's hair in an attempt to 'simulate Whiteness', whether chemically or with the use of heat, came to be seen by some as an act of self-hatred and a sign of [[internalized oppression]] imposed by White-dominated [[mainstream media]].\n\nAt this time, an African-American person's \"ability to conform to mainstream standards of beauty [was] tied to being successful.\"<ref name=\"Tharps&Byrd2002\"/>{{rp|148}} Thus, rejecting straightened hair symbolized a deeper act of rejecting the belief that straightening hair and other forms of grooming which were deemed 'socially acceptable' were the only means of looking presentable and attaining success in society. The pressing comb and chemical straighteners became stigmatized within the community as symbols of oppression and imposed White beauty ideals. Certain Black people sought to embrace beauty and affirm and accept their natural physical traits. One of the ultimate goals of the Black movement was to evolve to a level where Black people \"were proud of black skin and kinky or nappy hair. As a result, natural hair became a symbol of that pride.\"<ref name=\"Tharps&Byrd2002\"/>{{rp|43}} Negative perceptions of afro-textured hair and beauty had been passed down through the generations, so they had become ingrained in Black mentality to the point where they had been accepted as [[conventional wisdom|simple truths]]. Wearing natural hair was seen as a progressive statement, and for all the support that the movement gathered, there were many who opposed natural hair both for its aesthetics and the ideology that it promoted. It caused tensions between the Black and White communities, as well as discomfort amongst more conservative African-Americans.\n\nThe style of afro-textured hair continues to be politicized in contemporary society. \"These issues of style are highly charged as sensitive questions about [an individual's] very 'identity'.\"<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">Mercer, Kobena. \"Black hair/style politics\". ''New Formations 3''. Winter (1987).</ref>{{rp|34}} Whether an individual decides to wear their hair in its natural state or alter it, all Black hairstyles convey a message.

''New Formations 3''. Winter (1987): 33\u201356.</ref>{{rp|36}} This value system is reinforced by the systematic [[racism]] that was, and still is, often hidden from the public eye in Western society. Racism 'works' by encouraging the devaluation of self-identity by the victims themselves, and that re-centering of a sense of pride is a [[prerequisite]] for a politics of resistance and reconstruction.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>{{rp|36}}\n\nIn this system, \"hair functions as a key 'ethnic signifier' because, compared with bodily shape or facial features, it can be changed more easily by cultural practices such as straightening.\"<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>{{rp|36}} Racism originally \"'politicized' [afro-textured] hair by burdening it with a range of negative social and [[psychological]] 'meanings'\"\u2014categorizing it as a problem.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>{{rp|37}} Ethnic difference that could be easily manipulated, like hair, was altered in order for ethnic minorities to [[cultural assimilation|assimilate]] into a dominant, Eurocentric society. Natural hairstyles, such as the [[Afro]] and [[dreadlocks]], \"counter-politicized the signifier of ethnic devalorization, redefining Blackness as a positive attribute\".<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/> By wearing their hair as it naturally grows, individuals with afro-textured hair were taking back [[Agency (sociology)|agency]] in deciding the value and politics of their own hair. Wearing one's hair naturally also opens up a new debate: Are those who decide to still wear their hair straightened, for example, less 'Black' or 'proud' of their heritage, than those who decide to wear their hair naturally? This debate is an often-ongoing topic of discussion within the community. The issue is highly debated and disputed, creating almost a social divide within the community between those who decide to be natural and those who do not.\n\n====Emancipation and post-Civil War====\nAfter the [[American Civil War]] and [[abolitionism in the United States|emancipation]], many African-Americans migrated to larger towns or cities, where they were influenced by new styles. The photos below show 19th-century women leaders with a variety of styles with natural hair. Others straightened their hair to conform to White beauty ideals. They wanted to succeed, and to avoid mistreatment including legal and social discrimination. Some women, and a smaller number of men, lightened their hair with household [[bleach]]. A variety of caustic products that contained bleaches, including laundry bleach, designed to be applied to afro-textured hair, were developed in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, as African Americans demanded more fashion options. They used creams and lotions, combined with hot irons, to straighten their hair.\n\nThe Black hair care industry was initially dominated by White-owned businesses. In the late 19th century, African-American entrepreneurs such as [[Annie Malone|Annie Turnbo Malone]], [[Madam C. J. Walker]], Madam Gold S.M. Young, Sara Spencer Washington and [[Garrett Augustus Morgan]] revolutionized hair care by inventing and marketing chemical (and heat-based) applications to alter the natural tightly curled texture. They rapidly became successful and dominated the Black hair care market. In 1898, [[Anthony Overton]] founded a hair care company that offered saponified coconut shampoo and AIDA hair [[pomade]]. Men began using pomades, among other products, to achieve the standard aesthetic look.\n\nDuring the 1930s, [[conk]]ing (vividly described in ''[[The Autobiography of Malcolm X]]'') became an innovative method in the U.S. for Black men to straighten their kinky hair. Women at that time tended either to wear wigs, or to hot-comb their hair (rather than conk it) in order to temporarily mimic a straight style without permanently altering the natural curl pattern. Popular until the 1960s, the conk hair style was achieved through the application of a painful [[lye]], egg and potato mixture that was toxic and immediately [[chemical burn|burned]] the scalp.\n\nBlack-owned businesses in the hair-care industry provided jobs for thousands of African-Americans. These business owners gave back strongly to the African-American community.<ref>Edmondson, V., & Carroll, A. (1999). Giving Back: An Examination of the Philanthropic Motivations, Orientations and Activities of Large Black-Owned Businesses. Journal of Business Ethics, 19(2), 171-179. Retrieved from http://www.jstor.org/stable/25074086</ref> During this time, hundreds of African-Americans became owner-operators of successful [[beauty salon]]s and [[barber]]shops. These offered [[perm (hairstyle)|permanents]] and [[hair-straightening]], as well as cutting and styling services, some to both White and Black clients. In this era, men regularly went to barber shops to have their beards groomed, and some Black barbers developed exclusively White, elite clientele, sometimes in association with hotels or clubs. Media images tended to perpetuate the ideals of European beauty of the majority culture, even when featuring African-Americans.\n\nAfrican-Americans began sponsoring their own [[beauty contest|beauty events]]. The winners, many of whom wore straight hair styles and some of whom were of [[mixed race]], adorned [[Black press|Black magazines]] and product [[advertisement]]s. In the early 20th century, media portrayal of traditional African hair styles, such as braids and cornrows, was associated with African-Americans who were poor and lived in [[rural area]]s. In the early decades of the [[Great Migration (African American)|Great Migration]], when millions of African Americans left the [[Southern United States|South]] for opportunities in [[Northeastern United States|northern]] and [[midwest]]ern industrial cities, many African Americans wanted to leave this rural association behind.<ref name=\"culturalhistory\">{{cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/encyclopediaofha0000sher|url-access=registration|page=[https://archive.org/details/encyclopediaofha0000sher/page/17 17]|quote=+slaves +scalp.|title=Encyclopedia of Hair: A Cultural History|accessdate=2011-05-22|author=Victoria Sherrow|year=2006|publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group|isbn=978-0-313-33145-9}}</ref>\n<!-- Please do not modify rows. -->\n<gallery class=\"center\">\nFile:Cerca 1850 African American woman.jpg|African-American woman wearing styled textured hair.

Natural hair [[blog]]s include [[Black girl with long hair|Black Girl Long Hair (BGLH)]], Curly Nikki and Afro Hair Club. With the emergence of [[hip-hop]] culture and Jamaican influences like [[reggae]] music, more non-Black people have begun to wear these hairstyles as well. A new market has developed in such hair products as \"Out of Africa\" shampoo.\n\nThe popularity of natural hair has waxed and waned. In the early 21st century, a significant percentage of African-American women still straighten their hair with relaxers of some kind (either heat- or chemical-based). This is done despite the fact that prolonged application of such chemicals (or heat) can result in overprocessing, breakage and thinning of the hair. Rooks (1996) argues that hair-care products designed to straighten hair, which have been marketed by white-owned companies in African American publications since the 1830s, represent unrealistic and unattainable standards of beauty.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Hair raising : beauty, culture, and African American women|last=Rooks|first=Noliwe M.|date=1996|page=13|publisher=Rutgers University Press|isbn=9780585098272|location=New Brunswick, N.J.|oclc=44964950|url=https://www.google.com/books?id=lCQbqC3lQnEC&pg=PA13#v=onepage&q&f=false}}</ref>\n\nSales of relaxers took a great fall among African-American women from 2010 to 2015.

Though this expression of identity has been joyful for the community, it is not celebrated as much in American culture. There have been numerous events in history that have shown disapproval of Black hair styles, some of which have transcended into present day. Black hairstyles that are straight and more reserved seem to be the more accepted styles. Other hair styles may face scrutiny due to their vast difference to the White beauty idealistic hair. The idea of accommodating this White beauty ideal has a strong presence in everyday life, but more specifically the workplace.\n\nIn 1971 [[Melba Tolliver]], a [[WABC-TV]] correspondent, made national headlines when she wore an [[Afro]] while covering the wedding of [[Tricia Nixon Cox]], daughter of President [[Richard Nixon]].

Stacia begins her story describing her \u201cBig Chop\u201d, a phrase used to indicate cutting off the relaxed or processed hair. A couple months after her big chop, she entered the Job market and she became very nervous about how her hair would appear to job interviewers. Luckily, none of the interviewers acknowledged her hair in a discriminating way. Stacia later discussed the first appearance of \u201cthe bush\u201d in being a political statement and related it to her situation, worried that her hair could be seen as a \"professional liability\". Then she made a comparison between her natural hair, which is easier to style, and her relaxed hair, which is more accepted.

The three main causes of frizz are genetics, hair damage, and humidity. '''Frizzy hair''' can be seen as a positive or a negative trait depending on the current fashion and one's personal preference. Many hair products, such as [[hair gel|gels]], [[pomades]], and [[Hair wax|hair waxes]], are designed to reduce frizz.\n\n==Definition==\nThere is more than one [[wikt:frizz|definition of frizz]]. Researchers who studied the perception of hair health found that while women around the world perceived the absence of frizz as a sign of healthy hair, how they described \"frizz\" varied widely according to hair type and desired style. As described by women in the study, the two main types of frizz are:\n\n#short strands sticking up at the part and throughout the hair length that \"project away from the main body of hair\"; this type is especially noticeable on women with [[straight hair]] who are trying to achieve a smooth style; and\n#strands of wavy or [[curly hair]] that do not align with others to form a defined wave or curl.<ref name=\"marsh40\">Marsh (2015), p. 40.</ref>\n\nBy this definition, frizz is not exclusively a characteristic of curly hair; straight hair can be frizzy, and tightly curled or [[afro-textured hair|afro-textured]] hair can be [[:File:Curly Girl Method.jpg|frizz-free]].<ref name=\"pattern\">{{cite web |website=Naturally Curly |title=7 Reasons You Can't Figure Out Your Curl Pattern |date=January 11, 2015 |url=http://www.naturallycurly.com/curlreading/home/7-reasons-you-cant-figure-out-your-curl-pattern/}}</ref> \"Frizz\" sometimes refers to curly hair in general, but that is not what most women understand the term to mean.<ref name=\"marsh40\" />\n\n==Causes==\n\nAccording to cosmetic chemist Randy Schueller, the three main causes of frizz are genetics, damage, and humidity.<ref name=\"schueller\">{{cite web |website=The Beauty Brains |last1=Schueller |first1=Randy |title=The top 3 causes of frizzy hair |date=October 2006 |url=http://thebeautybrains.com/2006/10/the-top-3-causes-of-frizzy-hair/ }}</ref>\n\n===Genetics===\n\nSome wavy or curly hair naturally aligns or \"clumps\" in a clearly defined, consistent pattern, and some does not. Curly hair that does not have natural curl definition appears frizzy and is sometimes mistakenly characterized as damaged.<ref name=\"pattern\" /><ref name=\"schueller\" />\n\nEven when hair has a defined curl pattern, combing or brushing it when it is dry can break up the clumps, causing the hair to expand into a frizzy mass.

Direct heat can boil the water in the hair, causing bubbles to form inside the hair fiber, weakening the hair.<ref>Blume-Peytavi (2008), p. 290.</ref> Some authors recommend avoiding heat altogether, and allowing the hair to air-dry.<ref>LaFlesh (2010), p. 113.</ref>\n\nOther common causes of hair damage include the use of [[relaxers]] and other harsh chemicals;<ref name=\"rules\" /> use of a razor to cut curly hair, which weakens the hair cuticle and promotes frizz;<ref>Milady (2011), p. 372.</ref> and harsh shampoos that strip the hair of its natural oils.<ref name=\"blume512\">Blume-Peytavi (2008), p. 512.</ref>\n\nHaving some hairs that are shorter than others is not necessarily a sign of breakage. Hair naturally sheds as it reaches the end of its growth cycle, and a new hair grows in its place; the average lifespan is about six years.<ref>LaFlesh (2010), pp. 26-27.</ref>\n\n===Humidity===\n\nIn a humid environment, moisture penetrates the hair shaft and is absorbed into the [[Cortex (hair)|cortex]], causing the proteins there to swell. Different kinds of proteins absorb moisture and swell differently, causing the hair shaft to twist and bend in an irregular pattern.

The three main causes of frizz are genetics, hair damage, and humidity. '''Frizzy hair''' can be seen as a positive or a negative trait depending on the current fashion and one's personal preference. Many hair products, such as [[hair gel|gels]], [[pomades]], and [[Hair wax|hair waxes]], are designed to reduce frizz.\n\n==Definition==\nThere is more than one [[wikt:frizz|definition of frizz]]. Researchers who studied the perception of hair health found that while women around the world perceived the absence of frizz as a sign of healthy hair, how they described \"frizz\" varied widely according to hair type and desired style. As described by women in the study, the two main types of frizz are:\n\n#short strands sticking up at the part and throughout the hair length that \"project away from the main body of hair\"; this type is especially noticeable on women with [[straight hair]] who are trying to achieve a smooth style; and\n#strands of wavy or [[curly hair]] that do not align with others to form a defined wave or curl.<ref name=\"marsh40\">Marsh (2015), p. 40.</ref>\n\nBy this definition, frizz is not exclusively a characteristic of curly hair; straight hair can be frizzy, and tightly curled or [[afro-textured hair|afro-textured]] hair can be [[:File:Curly Girl Method.jpg|frizz-free]].<ref name=\"pattern\">{{cite web |website=Naturally Curly |title=7 Reasons You Can't Figure Out Your Curl Pattern |date=January 11, 2015 |url=http://www.naturallycurly.com/curlreading/home/7-reasons-you-cant-figure-out-your-curl-pattern/}}</ref> \"Frizz\" sometimes refers to curly hair in general, but that is not what most women understand the term to mean.<ref name=\"marsh40\" />\n\n==Causes==\n\nAccording to cosmetic chemist Randy Schueller, the three main causes of frizz are genetics, damage, and humidity.<ref name=\"schueller\">{{cite web |website=The Beauty Brains |last1=Schueller |first1=Randy |title=The top 3 causes of frizzy hair |date=October 2006 |url=http://thebeautybrains.com/2006/10/the-top-3-causes-of-frizzy-hair/ }}</ref>\n\n===Genetics===\n\nSome wavy or curly hair naturally aligns or \"clumps\" in a clearly defined, consistent pattern, and some does not.

It stars [[John Thaw]] as Detective Inspector Jack Regan and [[Dennis Waterman]] as his partner, Detective Sergeant George Carter. The programme's title derives from \"[[Sweeney Todd]]\", which is [[Cockney]] [[rhyming slang]] for \"Flying Squad\". Produced by [[Thames Television]] subsidiary [[Euston Films]] for broadcast on the [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]] network, it began as a television film ''Regan'' written by [[Ian Kennedy Martin]], brother of [[Troy Kennedy Martin]], who wrote several episodes and also the second film. Such was its popularity in the UK that it spawned two [[feature film]] spin-offs, ''[[Sweeney!]]'' and ''[[Sweeney 2]]''. In the early 1990s repeats aired on UK [[Gold (UK TV channel)|Gold]], but repeats currently air on [[ITV4]]\n\n==Background==\nOriginally developed from a one-off TV drama entitled ''Regan'', a 90-minute television film that [[Ian Kennedy Martin]] wrote for Thames Television's ''Armchair Cinema'' series in 1974. The part of Regan was specifically written for [[John Thaw]], who was by this time a friend of Ian Kennedy Martin, with whom he had worked on the TV drama series ''[[Redcap (TV series)|Redcap]]''<ref name=\"IanK-M\">{{cite web |title=Ian Kennedy-Martin - Sweeney: a preamble |url=http://www.iankennedymartin.com/page4.htm |website=www.iankennedymartin.com |accessdate=1 February 2019}}</ref> in the 1960s.\n\nFrom the very beginning, ''Regan'' was seen as having series potential. After the television film scored highly in the ratings, work began on the development of the series proper. Ian Kennedy Martin's idea was for the series to be mainly studio-based, with more dialogue and less action, but producer [[Ted Childs]] disagreed, and in consequence Ian Kennedy Martin parted company with the project. Childs produced it on [[16mm]] film, a format that allowed for a much smaller film unit than videotape at that time. This made it possible to shoot almost entirely on location which helped give the series a startling degree of realism and to use film editing techniques which enabled him to give the show a heavy bias toward action sequences.\n\nThe television play and the subsequent series were commissioned by [[Thames Television]] and produced by its film division [[Euston Films]]. It was originally broadcast on [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]] between 2 January 1975 and 28 December 1978 at 21:00\u201322:00 on weekdays (usually Mondays), with repeated screenings at the same time until the early 1980s.\n\nThe writers were given strict guidelines to follow: \"Each show will have an overall screen time (minus titles) of 48 minutes 40 seconds. Each film will open with a teaser of up to 3 minutes, which will be followed by the opening titles. The story will be played across three acts, each being no more than 19 minutes and no less than 8 minutes in length. Regan will appear in every episode, Carter in approximately 10 out of 13 episodes. In addition to these main characters, scripts should be based around three major speaking parts, with up to ten minor speaking parts.\"<ref name=\"Made4TV-Euston\">{{cite book |last1=Alvarado |first1=Manuel |last2=Stewart |first2=John |title=Made for Television: Euston Films Limited |date=1985 |publisher=BFI Pub. |isbn=9780423013108 |page=59 |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=ywULAAAAIAAJ |language=en}}</ref>\n\nIt is a fast-paced edge-of-your-seat action series, depicting the Squad's relentless battle against armed robbery; but it nevertheless includes a substantial degree of humour. For the time, it had a high degree of graphic on-screen violence and the episodes tend to have a high body count with several deaths per episode.\n\nPreviously, most dramas featuring the police had shied away from showing them as fallible. The police in ''The Sweeney'' were brutal and violent in dealing with London's hardened criminals, and prone to cutting corners and bending laws. The series showed a somewhat more realistic side of the police, often depicting a disregard for authority, rules and the \"system\", so long it as got the job done.<ref name=NotDixon>{{cite |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/tvandradio/11998344/The-Sweeney-gave-us-TVs-most-arresting-coppers.html |publisher=The Telegraph |title=The Sweeney gave us TV's most arresting coppers |date=17 November 2015 |accessdate=27 April 2017}}</ref><ref name=MoreNotDixon>{{cite |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3bBEAwAAQBAJ&pg=PA157&lpg=PA157&dq=the+sweeney+dixon&source=bl&ots=rAvgGHewkm&sig=1mpshbC_PLq17ntEmnZ40s8bFqI&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjlwYjCpMTTAhUlJ8AKHcWeAfoQ6AEIdTAN#v=onepage&q=the%20sweeney%20dixon&f=false |pages=157-8 |title=Crime, Justice and the Media |last1=Marsh |first1=Ian |last2=Melville |first2=Gaynor |date=2014 |publisher=Routledge |edition=2 |isbn=1134087152}}</ref> Until ''The Sweeney'', this had been a subject largely ignored by British television.<ref name=NotDixon/><ref name=MoreNotDixon/> The series' own awareness of breaking new ground is evident in episodes such as the second series \"Trojan Bus\", where Regan briefly whistles the theme-tune to ''[[Dixon of Dock Green]]'' after a particularly elementary piece of detective work.\n\nThe series reflected the fact that it was made during a dark period for the real-life Flying Squad, which in the late 1970s had been publicly censured for being involved in [[bribery]], [[police corruption|corruption]] and excessively close links with the criminal fraternity.<ref name=NotDixon /> The actual commander of the Flying Squad, [[Chief Superintendent|Detective Chief Superintendent]] Kenneth Drury, was convicted of five counts of corruption and imprisoned for eight years on 7 July 1977 (the incident was a plot element in the movie ''[[Sweeney 2]]''). An internal investigation, called [[Operation Countryman]], was then launched to stamp out corruption.<ref>Andrew Walker.

Their senior officer was DCI Frank Haskins. However, occasionally other senior officers took charge of the Flying Squad when DCI Haskins was seconded to other duties or investigations.\n\n====Jack Regan====\n[[John Thaw]] stars as [[Detective Inspector]] John \"Jack\" Albert Regan, a tough police officer, often frustrated by Scotland Yard's red tape. Originally from [[Manchester]] (like Thaw himself), he has been in London for several years, so his accent has modified, but traces of his northern origins are still evident. He also occasionally refers to his northern roots (his poor upbringing, his father's work on the [[Manchester Ship Canal]]), which brings banter from George Carter, a Londoner, such as humming \"[[The Red Flag]]\". A heavy drinker and smoker (comically, he is sometimes seen stealing other people's cigarettes), Regan has some success with women\u2014although not as much as Carter, or in one episode, DCI Haskins. He can be seen as quick with his fists. He has an ex-wife, Kate, and daughter, Susie, who live in [[Ruislip]]; in the last episode of the first series, \"Abduction\", Susie is kidnapped.\n\nRegan helps out an ex-informer whose son is kidnapped in \"Feet of Clay\" (Series 4); and his sympathetic pushing enables his boss Haskins to ask for help when his wife goes missing after a breakdown, in \"Victims\" (Series 4); it's Regan who finds her. Regan can bend the rules in order to achieve the desired result: for example, fabricating evidence and arranging for a criminal to be kidnapped in \"Queen's Pawn\", and illegally entering private properties and threatening to lie about being attacked by a prisoner in order to get information in ''Regan''. Despite this, he's unwilling to cheat for personal gain: he delivers a sharp put-down to a corrupt copper in \"Bad Apple\", and refuses to take a bribe in \"Golden Fleece\".\n\nIn the Squad, informality is everything. Everyone calls DCI Haskins simply \"Haskins\" (except to his face), though Regan occasionally calls him by his first name, Frank. No one ever calls Regan \"Mister\"\u2014except the villains, or sometimes Carter when talking to Haskins. To the Squad, he is always simply \"the Guv'nor\", or just \"Guv\". In turn, he invariably calls Carter and the other Squad members by their first names. When off duty, he and George Carter are friends and drinking buddies, so in private Carter calls him \"Jack\". This is all in accordance with widespread police convention.\n\nRegan is driven around in a [[Ford Consul|Ford Consul (Granada Mark I based) (1972\u20131975)]] 3.0 GT. Although he is seen driving various cars himself in the series, he always has a driver\u2014usually Bill (an uncredited role played by Tony Allen)\u2014when using the Consul Granada (and the similar [[Ford Granada (Europe)|Ford Granada]] models used in later stories), which served as a Squad car: when the Squad travelled they always went \"mob handed\" (in considerable numbers). Regan is seen to also have his own car outside of the Squad, a [[Ford Cortina#Mark II (1966\u20131970)|Mark II Ford Cortina]].\n\n====George Carter====\n[[Dennis Waterman]] plays Detective Sergeant George Hamilton Carter who comes from [[south London]]; in the pilot episode, Regan seeks him out because of his knowledge of the south London area. His age is given in the episode \"Hit and Run\" as 26. In the series' timeline, we learn that George had previously been in the Squad, but had quit for family reasons (cf. ''Regan'' and \"Jigsaw\"). George was married to Alison Carter, a schoolteacher, but is widowed in the episode \"Hit and Run\" when Alison is murdered by mistake by a gang of diamond smugglers. He is a former amateur [[boxing|boxer]], as shown in the pilot ''Regan'', and is described as having professional boxing potential in the episode \"Chalk and Cheese\". Like his superior, he likes a drink (though less so than Regan), and appreciates [[football (soccer)|football]] and\u2014after the death of his wife\u2014attractive women. Carter isn't as potentially violent or aggressive as Regan, and usually plays the \"good cop\" role.\n\n====Frank Haskins====\n[[Garfield Morgan]] plays Detective Chief Inspector Frank Haskins, who is married with three children at boarding schools, and is Regan's immediate superior. Prior to the series timeline, the character had done \"[[National Service]] in the [[Royal Corps of Signals|Signals Corps]] in a minor intelligence role\" (as revealed in the episode \"Stay Lucky, Eh?\"). He is frequently seen at odds with Regan, preferring more conventional \"by-the-book\" policing methods.\n\nThe main \"Haskins episodes\" are \"Golden Fleece\", in which he is set up to be the victim of a corruption inquiry, and \"Victims\", in which his wife suffers a mental breakdown attributed to her memories of a miscarriage. Although he appeared in the opening titles of every episode of the first three series, he did not appear in all of them.\n\nThe character was not present at the start of the fourth, final series, and his role was taken by other superiors such as Detective Chief Inspector Anderson, played by [[Richard Wilson (Scottish actor)|Richard Wilson]], and Detective Chief Superintendent Braithwaite, played by [[Benjamin Whitrow]]. Haskins returned a few episodes into the fourth series. There are two versions of the fourth series opening credits\u2014one with and one without Haskins.\n\n===Other recurring characters===\n\n====The Squad====\nIn the early episodes, the team has a variety of drivers including Len ([[Jack McKenzie (actor)|Jack McKenzie]]) (the first two episodes) and Fred (Denis DeMarne) (in the episode \"Jigsaw\"). However, the episode \"The Placer\" in the first series introduces the character of Bill the driver (played by Tony Allen, who subsequently worked as wardrobe manager for many of John Thaw's later projects), and he remains a constant throughout the series, although he plays a peripheral, non-speaking role in most episodes.\n\nDetective Sergeant Tom Daniels ([[John Alkin]]) is the most prominent member of the supporting Squad. Other members include Sergeant Kent, Detective Constable Thorpe (Martin Read) and DS Matthews (John Flanagan) in the first series, DC Jerry Burtonshaw ([[Nick Brimble]]) (Series 1-2, 4) and DC Jellyneck (James Warrior) (Series 4). Detective Chief Superintendent Maynon ([[Morris Perry]]) appears occasionally as a senior officer, and is seen as being more willing than Haskins to bend the rules in order to get a result in the episode \"Queen's Pawn\". With Haskins absent, a semi-regular senior officer named DCS Braithwaite ([[Benjamin Whitrow]]) appears in Series 4.\n\n====Family====\nOther main characters include the close family of the three leads.\n\nRegan's ex-wife Kate appears in the episode \"Abduction\", after previously featuring in the pilot; and his daughter Susie ([[Jennifer Thanisch]]) appears in several episodes, most notably, \"Abduction\".\n\nCarter's wife Alison ([[Stephanie Turner]]) is seen attempting to prise him away from the Squad in the episode \"Jigsaw\", while her hostility toward Regan is apparent in the episode \"Abduction\". She is murdered in a case of mistaken identity in the episode \"Hit and Run\". In the DVD commentary for \"Abduction\", it is mentioned that the reason for this was that the actress (Stephanie Turner) was asking for too much money to continue to appear in the series. Her death was convenient for the show, releasing Carter to play a more freewheeling role, \"on the pull\"\u2014and allowing his banter with Regan, which had become a very popular part of the show, to develop further. Stephanie Turner went on to appear in ''[[Juliet Bravo]]'', also devised and part-written by Ian Kennedy Martin.\n\nDoreen Haskins features in some episodes, although the penultimate episode \"Victims\" deals with her deteriorating mental health and returns to the theme of the job's impact on family life. One of Haskins' three children, Richard, also appears in that episode.\n\n===Guest stars===\n<!---Alpha A-to-Z-Please--->\nGuest stars in the show included:\n\n{{Col-begin}}\n{{Col-break}}\n*[[Joss Ackland]]\n*[[Tony Anholt]]\n*[[Coral Atkins]]\n*[[Lynda Bellingham]]\n*[[Hywel Bennett]]\n*[[Brian Blessed]]\n*[[James Booth]]\n*[[Donald Burton]]\n*[[Simon Callow]]\n*[[Cheryl Campbell]]\n*[[Tony Caunter]]\n*[[Warren Clarke]]\n*[[George Cole (actor)|George Cole]] '''\u026b'''\n*[[Kenneth Colley]]\n*[[James Cosmo]]\n*[[John Rhys-Davies]]\n*[[Vernon Dobtcheff]]\n*[[Diana Dors]]\n*[[Colin Douglas (actor)|Colin Douglas]]\n*[[Lesley-Anne Down]]\n*[[Rosemarie Dunham]]\n*[[Michael Elphick]]\n*[[Arthur English]]\n{{Col-break}}\n*[[Norman Eshley]]\n*[[Derek Francis]]\n*[[Ronald Fraser (actor)|Ronald Fraser]]\n*[[Prunella Gee]]\n*[[Sheila Gish]]\n*[[Peter Glaze]]\n*[[Julian Glover]]\n*[[Brian Hall (actor)|Brian Hall]]\n*[[Cheryl Hall]]\n*[[Edward Hardwicke]]\n*[[Tina Heath]]\n*[[Ian Hendry]]\n*[[Del Henney]]\n*[[Paul Henry (actor)|Paul Henry]]\n*[[Julian Holloway]]\n*[[John Hurt]]\n*[[Ken Hutchison]]\n*[[Barrie Ingham]]\n*[[David Jackson (British actor)|David Jackson]]\n*[[Geraldine James]]\n*[[Peter Jeffrey]]\n*[[Paul Jones (singer)|Paul Jones]]\n*[[John Junkin]]\n{{Col-break}}\n*[[Roy Kinnear]]\n*[[Ronald Lacey]]\n*[[Alan Lake]]\n*[[Lynda La Plante]]\n*[[George Layton]]\n*[[Maureen Lipman]]\n*[[Sue Lloyd]]\n*[[David Lodge (actor)|David Lodge]]\n*[[Kenny Lynch]]\n*[[John Lyons (actor)|John Lyons]]\n*[[T.

Due to this, the number of different filming locations had to be restricted to 10, i.e. one location per day. At the Euston Films production office in [[St Paul's Juniors#History|Colet Court]], Hammersmith, a standing set of the Flying Squad offices (referred to as \"The Factory\" by the characters) was constructed which provided an alternative option for when inclement weather restricted the day's shooting. Two days would normally be spent filming on the set, equalling 10 minutes of any episode being set in the offices. Shooting took place through the spring, summer, autumn and winter months; exterior night shooting was expensive, and was limited to three minutes of external night material in any episode.\n\nEach episode had an eight-and-a-half-week production schedule: two weeks' pre-production (for [[Casting (performing arts)|casting]], finding locations etc.), two weeks' shooting, four weeks' picture [[editing]] (the first two weeks of which overlapped with the shoot), two weeks' sound editing, and two-and-a-half days' [[Dubbing (filmmaking)|dubbing]].\n\n===Filming locations===\nMost of the locations used for filming ''The Sweeney'' were around the west London area\u2014in particular, [[Acton, London|Acton]], [[Chiswick]], [[Shepherd's Bush]], [[Hammersmith]], [[Fulham]], [[Earl's Court]], [[Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea|Kensington & Chelsea]] and [[Notting Hill]] districts, close to the Euston Films HQ at Colet Court in Hammersmith. The [[London Docklands]], derelict at the time, were ideal for filming location sequences. The opening titles were filmed in Colet Gardens. However, other notable locations in London, the South East of England and further afield were also used for filming the show's episodes and included:\n\n*[[Chertsey]]/[[Penton Hook Lock]], [[Surrey]] - \"Thin Ice\", \"Bad Apple\", \"On the Run\", \"Feet of Clay\" & \"Jack or Knave?\".\n*[[Battersea]] - \"Jigsaw\", \"Stoppo Driver\", \"Faces\", \"Trap\", \"Trojan Bus\", \"Country Boy\", \"Visiting Fireman\", \"Tomorrow Man\", \"May\" & \"Victims\", \"Chalk & Cheese\" (Craven Arms, Lavender Hill)\n*[[Bermondsey]] - \"Regan\".\n*[[Black Park Country Park]], [[Wexham]], [[Buckinghamshire]] - \"Regan\", \"Payoff\", \"On the Run\" & \"Hearts & Minds\".\n*[[Dulwich]] - \"Regan\", \"Ringer\".\n*[[Dulwich Hamlet F.C.]] \"Ringer\".\n*[[Gozo]]/[[Malta#Islands|Maltese Archipelago]] - \"Sweeney 2\".\n*[[Earl's Court]] - \"Bait\" (Cromwell Crescent & Logan Place).\n*[[Earlsfield]] - Garratt Lane and Garratt Snooker Club - \"Supersnout\".\n*[[Hammersmith]] - \"Jackpot\".\n*[[Heathrow, London|Heathrow]] - \"Golden Boy\", \"Stoppo Driver\" & \"Tomorrow Man\".\n*[[Kingston upon Thames]] - \"Hit and Run\" & \"Trojan Bus\".\n*[[Ladbroke Grove]] - \"Hard Men\"\n*[[Maida Vale]] - \"Night Out\".\n*[[Peckham]] - \"Ringer\".\n*[[Potters Bar]] \"Big Spender\".\n*[[Putney]]/[[Putney Bridge]] \"Contact Breaker\", \"Abduction\" \"Taste of Fear\" & \"Sweeney 2\".\n*[[Queens Park Rangers F.C.]], [[Loftus Road]] - \"I Want the Man!\".\n*[[Raynes Park]] - \"Big Spender\", \"Golden Fleece\" & \"Victims\".\n*[[Richmond, London|Richmond]] (River Lane; Leonard Gold's house) -\"The Bigger They Are\"\n*[[Roehampton]] - \"Queen's Pawn\", \"Golden Fleece\" ([[Bank of England]] Sports Centre), \"Victims\" & \"Sweeney 2\" (Danebury Avenue/Alton Estate).\n*[[Sandown Park Racecourse]], [[Esher]], Surrey - \"Big Spender\".\n*[[Shepherd's Bush]] - \"Jackpot\".\n*[[Southall Gas Works]] - \"Faces\".\n*[[Southwark]] - \"Ringer\".\n*[[Staines]], [[Middlesex]] - \"The Placer\".\n*[[Tooting Bec]] - \"Abduction\" (Trinity Road & Tooting Bec Tube Station).\n*[[Twickenham]] - \"The Placer\", \"Golden Fleece\" ([[Twickenham Stadium]]) & \"Bad Apple\".\n*[[Uxbridge]] - \"Thou Shalt Not Kill\" ([[Brunel University]]) & \"Bad Apple\".\n*[[Wandsworth]] - \"Queens Pawn\", \"Jigsaw\", \"Abduction\", \"Country Boy\", \"Tomorrow Man\", \"May\", \"Drag Act\" & \"Sweeney 2\".\n*[[White City, London|White City]] - \"May\" ([[White City Stadium]]).\n*[[Wimbledon, London|Wimbledon]] - \"Contact Breaker\" ([[Wimbledon Stadium]]), \"Stay Lucky, Eh?\" \"May\", \"Lady Luck\" & \"Money, Money, Money\".\n*[[Wokingham]], [[Berkshire]] - \"Thin Ice\".\n\n==Episodes==\nA pilot episode, ''Regan'', was made as part of the ''Armchair Cinema'' series, first shown 4 June 1974.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Chibnall |first1=Steve |last2=Murphy |first2=Robert |title=British Crime Cinema |date=2005 |publisher=Routledge |isbn=9781134702701 |page=143 |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=jwyGAgAAQBAJ&pg=PA143&dq=Regan+%27%27Armchair+Cinema%27%27++4+June+1974&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjTwp6iqp3gAhXhSRUIHajsDIkQ6AEIKjAA#v=onepage&q&f=false |accessdate=2 February 2019 |language=en}}</ref> In all, four series were made with Series One being broadcast between January and March 1975 and Series Two following between September and November of the same year. Series Three was broadcast between September and December 1976, with the final series being shown two years later from September to December 1978. Two 90-minute feature films, ''Sweeney!'' and ''Sweeney 2'', were released in 1977 and 1978 respectively, between the third and fourth series.\n\n===Series 1===\nThe promotional episode shown to the press was \"Thin Ice\", which featured a relatively lightweight and somewhat humorous story, some comedy and international locations.\n\nEpisodes from the first series included \"Ringer\", where the team were attempting to prevent a criminal being sprung from prison, \"Jackpot\", \"Stoppo Driver\", and \"Abduction\" (in which Regan's daughter Susie was kidnapped), focusing on the strains which the job caused to family life. \"Jigsaw\" subtly illustrated the backgrounds and family lives of Regan and Carter; parallels are drawn between the unhappy situation of the main villain's family and Regan's own domestic situation.\n\nThe early episodes feature a great degree of hostility and mistrust between Regan and his senior officer, Haskins, who in one episode (\"Ringer\") attempts to separate Carter from Regan in order to help Carter's career.\n\nThe episode \"Queen's Pawn\" is a display of how Regan is willing to bend the rules in order to get a result, as he fabricates evidence, illegally opens private mail, and even arranges the kidnapping of one of the criminals in order to get the desired result.\n\n;Series 1 Episodes\n'''''All episodes were broadcast in 1975 on ITV, Thursdays at 21:00.''''' <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thesweeney.info/episodes.html |title=THE SWEENEY - Episode Guide |publisher=thesweeney.info |date=1974-06-04 |accessdate=2010-05-31}}{{dead link|date=September 2019}}</ref>\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"width:100%; margin:auto; background:#FFFFFF;\"\n|-\n! style=\"background-color: #dbe9f4; color:#000; text-align: center;\"|Episode No\n!! style=\"background-color: #dbe9f4; color:#000; text-align: center;\"|Title\n!! style=\"background-color: #dbe9f4; color:#000; text-align: center;\"|Original airdate\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber  = 1\n |Title          = Ringer\n |RTitle         = \n |OriginalAirDate= {{Start date|1975|1|2|df=y}}\n |ShortSummary   = Detective Inspector Jack Regan endangers an operation, and loses his girlfriend's car.\n |LineColor      = dbe9f4\n}}\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber  = 2\n |Title          = Jackpot\n |RTitle         = \n |OriginalAirDate= {{Start date|1975|1|9|df=y}}\n |ShortSummary   = Regan and his team are suspected of pocketing \u00a335,000.\n |LineColor      = dbe9f4\n}}\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber  = 3\n |Title          = Thin Ice\n |RTitle         = \n |OriginalAirDate= {{Start date|1975|1|16|df=y}}\n |ShortSummary   = Regan's determination to catch a crook leads to conflict with senior officers.\n |LineColor      = dbe9f4\n}}\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber  = 4\n |Title          = Queen's Pawn\n |RTitle         = \n |OriginalAirDate= {{Start date|1975|1|23|df=y}}\n |ShortSummary   = Three crooks walk out of court as free men.

The final series has been criticised as the weakest.{{citation needed|date=December 2013}} This decline in quality led John Thaw and Dennis Waterman to the realisation that the show was in danger of running out of steam, and to take the decision to end it while it was still at the peak of its popularity.\n\nNotable episodes include \"Nightmare\", which features a slightly experimental dream sequence as part of the plot. This is also the episode with the highest number of deaths, and features another then-contemporary plot of two ex-[[Provisional Irish Republican Army|IRA]] men committing a major crime in order to buy their way back into the organisation. \"Bait\" featured a performance by [[George Sewell]], who had starred in the Euston Films-produced episodes of an earlier police series, ''[[Special Branch (TV series)|Special Branch]]''; earlier still he had featured in the film ''[[Get Carter]]'', which was a major influence on ''The Sweeney'', and whose main character, Jack Carter, may have been the inspiration for the names of the two main ''Sweeney'' characters.\n\n\"Hearts and Minds\", the last episode to be filmed, featured the comedians [[Morecambe and Wise]], and was a quid pro quo for the appearance of Waterman and Thaw in a sketch in the 1976 ''[[Morecambe and Wise#Christmas specials|Morecambe and Wise Christmas show]]'' on the BBC.\n\nThe final broadcast episode, \"Jack or Knave?\", which aired on 28 December 1978, saw an ambiguous ending, with the main character, Jack Regan, temporarily locked up after being implicated in a corruption scandal, then finally being exonerated. He then announces that he's had it with the Squad, and the series ends with him resigning in disgust, but it's left open as to whether he would be persuaded to change his mind.\n\n;Series 4 Episodes\n'''''All episodes were broadcast in 1978 on ITV, Thursdays at 21:00.'''''\n\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"width:100%; margin:auto; background:#FFFFFF;\"\n|-\n! style=\"background-color: #dbe9f4; color:#000; text-align: right;\"|Ep.&nbsp;No\n!! style=\"background-color: #dbe9f4; color:#000; text-align: left;\"|Title\n!! style=\"background-color: #dbe9f4; color:#000; text-align: right;\"|Original airdate\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber  = 1\n |Title          = Messenger of the Gods\n |RTitle         = \n |OriginalAirDate= {{Start date|1978|9|7|df=y}}\n |ShortSummary   = \n |LineColor      = dbe9f4\n}}\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber  = 2\n |Title          = Hard Men\n |RTitle         = \n |OriginalAirDate= {{Start date|1978|9|14|df=y}}\n |ShortSummary   = \n |LineColor      = dbe9f4\n}}\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber  = 3\n |Title          = Drag Act\n |RTitle         = \n |OriginalAirDate= {{Start date|1978|9|21|df=y}}\n |ShortSummary   = \n |LineColor      = dbe9f4\n}}\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber  = 4\n |Title          = Trust Red\n |RTitle         = \n |OriginalAirDate= {{Start date|1978|9|28|df=y}}\n |ShortSummary   = \n |LineColor      = dbe9f4\n}}\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber  = 5\n |Title          = Nightmare\n |RTitle         = \n |OriginalAirDate= {{Start date|1978|10|5|df=y}}\n |ShortSummary   = \n |LineColor      = dbe9f4\n}}\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber  = 6\n |Title          = Money, Money, Money\n |RTitle         = \n |OriginalAirDate= {{Start date|1978|10|12|df=y}}\n |ShortSummary   = \n |LineColor      = dbe9f4\n}}\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber  = 7\n |Title          = Bait\n |RTitle         = \n |OriginalAirDate= {{Start date|1978|10|19|df=y}}\n |ShortSummary   = \n |LineColor      = dbe9f4\n}}\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber  = 8\n |Title          = The Bigger They Are\n |RTitle         = \n |OriginalAirDate= {{Start date|1978|10|26|df=y}}\n |ShortSummary   = \n |LineColor      = dbe9f4\n}}\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber  = 9\n |Title          = Feet of Clay\n |RTitle         = \n |OriginalAirDate= {{Start date|1978|11|2|df=y}}\n |ShortSummary   = \n |LineColor      = dbe9f4\n}}\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber  = 10\n |Title          = One of Your Own\n |RTitle         = \n |OriginalAirDate= {{Start date|1978|11|9|df=y}}\n |ShortSummary   = \n |LineColor      = dbe9f4\n}}\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber  = 11\n |Title          = Hearts and Minds\n |RTitle         = \n |OriginalAirDate= {{Start date|1978|11|23|df=y}}\n |ShortSummary   = \n |LineColor      = dbe9f4\n}}\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber  = 12\n |Title          = Latin Lady\n |RTitle         = \n |OriginalAirDate= {{Start date|1978|11|30|df=y}}\n |ShortSummary   = \n |LineColor      = dbe9f4\n}}\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber  = 13\n |Title          = Victims\n |RTitle         = \n |OriginalAirDate= {{Start date|1978|12|14|df=y}}\n |ShortSummary   = \n |LineColor      = dbe9f4\n}}\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber  = 14\n |Title          = Jack or Knave?\n |RTitle         = \n |OriginalAirDate= {{Start date|1978|12|28|df=y}}\n |ShortSummary   = \n |LineColor      = dbe9f4\n}}\n|}\n\nThe following episodes were shot in 1977: '''Messenger of The Gods''', '''Drag Act''', '''Trust Red''', '''Money, Money, Money''', '''Feet of Clay''', '''One of Your Own''' and '''Jack or Knave?'''.\n\nThe following episodes were shot in 1978: '''Hard Men''', '''Nightmare''', '''Bait''', '''The Bigger They Are''', '''Hearts and Minds''', '''Latin Lady''' and '''Victims'''.\n\n==Film adaptations==\n{{Main|Sweeney!|Sweeney 2|The Sweeney (2012 film)}}\nThe cinema spin-offs of ''The Sweeney'' feature the same actors and characters.

It stars [[John Thaw]] as Detective Inspector Jack Regan and [[Dennis Waterman]] as his partner, Detective Sergeant George Carter. The programme's title derives from \"[[Sweeney Todd]]\", which is [[Cockney]] [[rhyming slang]] for \"Flying Squad\". Produced by [[Thames Television]] subsidiary [[Euston Films]] for broadcast on the [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]] network, it began as a television film ''Regan'' written by [[Ian Kennedy Martin]], brother of [[Troy Kennedy Martin]], who wrote several episodes and also the second film. Such was its popularity in the UK that it spawned two [[feature film]] spin-offs, ''[[Sweeney!]]'' and ''[[Sweeney 2]]''. In the early 1990s repeats aired on UK [[Gold (UK TV channel)|Gold]], but repeats currently air on [[ITV4]]\n\n==Background==\nOriginally developed from a one-off TV drama entitled ''Regan'', a 90-minute television film that [[Ian Kennedy Martin]] wrote for Thames Television's ''Armchair Cinema'' series in 1974. The part of Regan was specifically written for [[John Thaw]], who was by this time a friend of Ian Kennedy Martin, with whom he had worked on the TV drama series ''[[Redcap (TV series)|Redcap]]''<ref name=\"IanK-M\">{{cite web |title=Ian Kennedy-Martin - Sweeney: a preamble |url=http://www.iankennedymartin.com/page4.htm |website=www.iankennedymartin.com |accessdate=1 February 2019}}</ref> in the 1960s.\n\nFrom the very beginning, ''Regan'' was seen as having series potential. After the television film scored highly in the ratings, work began on the development of the series proper. Ian Kennedy Martin's idea was for the series to be mainly studio-based, with more dialogue and less action, but producer [[Ted Childs]] disagreed, and in consequence Ian Kennedy Martin parted company with the project. Childs produced it on [[16mm]] film, a format that allowed for a much smaller film unit than videotape at that time. This made it possible to shoot almost entirely on location which helped give the series a startling degree of realism and to use film editing techniques which enabled him to give the show a heavy bias toward action sequences.\n\nThe television play and the subsequent series were commissioned by [[Thames Television]] and produced by its film division [[Euston Films]]. It was originally broadcast on [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]] between 2 January 1975 and 28 December 1978 at 21:00\u201322:00 on weekdays (usually Mondays), with repeated screenings at the same time until the early 1980s.\n\nThe writers were given strict guidelines to follow: \"Each show will have an overall screen time (minus titles) of 48 minutes 40 seconds. Each film will open with a teaser of up to 3 minutes, which will be followed by the opening titles. The story will be played across three acts, each being no more than 19 minutes and no less than 8 minutes in length. Regan will appear in every episode, Carter in approximately 10 out of 13 episodes. In addition to these main characters, scripts should be based around three major speaking parts, with up to ten minor speaking parts.\"<ref name=\"Made4TV-Euston\">{{cite book |last1=Alvarado |first1=Manuel |last2=Stewart |first2=John |title=Made for Television: Euston Films Limited |date=1985 |publisher=BFI Pub. |isbn=9780423013108 |page=59 |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=ywULAAAAIAAJ |language=en}}</ref>\n\nIt is a fast-paced edge-of-your-seat action series, depicting the Squad's relentless battle against armed robbery; but it nevertheless includes a substantial degree of humour. For the time, it had a high degree of graphic on-screen violence and the episodes tend to have a high body count with several deaths per episode.\n\nPreviously, most dramas featuring the police had shied away from showing them as fallible. The police in ''The Sweeney'' were brutal and violent in dealing with London's hardened criminals, and prone to cutting corners and bending laws. The series showed a somewhat more realistic side of the police, often depicting a disregard for authority, rules and the \"system\", so long it as got the job done.<ref name=NotDixon>{{cite |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/tvandradio/11998344/The-Sweeney-gave-us-TVs-most-arresting-coppers.html |publisher=The Telegraph |title=The Sweeney gave us TV's most arresting coppers |date=17 November 2015 |accessdate=27 April 2017}}</ref><ref name=MoreNotDixon>{{cite |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3bBEAwAAQBAJ&pg=PA157&lpg=PA157&dq=the+sweeney+dixon&source=bl&ots=rAvgGHewkm&sig=1mpshbC_PLq17ntEmnZ40s8bFqI&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjlwYjCpMTTAhUlJ8AKHcWeAfoQ6AEIdTAN#v=onepage&q=the%20sweeney%20dixon&f=false |pages=157-8 |title=Crime, Justice and the Media |last1=Marsh |first1=Ian |last2=Melville |first2=Gaynor |date=2014 |publisher=Routledge |edition=2 |isbn=1134087152}}</ref> Until ''The Sweeney'', this had been a subject largely ignored by British television.<ref name=NotDixon/><ref name=MoreNotDixon/> The series' own awareness of breaking new ground is evident in episodes such as the second series \"Trojan Bus\", where Regan briefly whistles the theme-tune to ''[[Dixon of Dock Green]]'' after a particularly elementary piece of detective work.\n\nThe series reflected the fact that it was made during a dark period for the real-life Flying Squad, which in the late 1970s had been publicly censured for being involved in [[bribery]], [[police corruption|corruption]] and excessively close links with the criminal fraternity.<ref name=NotDixon /> The actual commander of the Flying Squad, [[Chief Superintendent|Detective Chief Superintendent]] Kenneth Drury, was convicted of five counts of corruption and imprisoned for eight years on 7 July 1977 (the incident was a plot element in the movie ''[[Sweeney 2]]''). An internal investigation, called [[Operation Countryman]], was then launched to stamp out corruption.<ref>Andrew Walker. [http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/3721695.stm The Sweeney's proud history], [[BBC]], 17 May 2004.</ref>\n\n==Cast and characters==\n\n===Main characters===\nThe main two characters were Detective Inspector Jack Regan and Detective Sergeant George Carter. Their senior officer was DCI Frank Haskins. However, occasionally other senior officers took charge of the Flying Squad when DCI Haskins was seconded to other duties or investigations.\n\n====Jack Regan====\n[[John Thaw]] stars as [[Detective Inspector]] John \"Jack\" Albert Regan, a tough police officer, often frustrated by Scotland Yard's red tape. Originally from [[Manchester]] (like Thaw himself), he has been in London for several years, so his accent has modified, but traces of his northern origins are still evident. He also occasionally refers to his northern roots (his poor upbringing, his father's work on the [[Manchester Ship Canal]]), which brings banter from George Carter, a Londoner, such as humming \"[[The Red Flag]]\". A heavy drinker and smoker (comically, he is sometimes seen stealing other people's cigarettes), Regan has some success with women\u2014although not as much as Carter, or in one episode, DCI Haskins. He can be seen as quick with his fists. He has an ex-wife, Kate, and daughter, Susie, who live in [[Ruislip]]; in the last episode of the first series, \"Abduction\", Susie is kidnapped.\n\nRegan helps out an ex-informer whose son is kidnapped in \"Feet of Clay\" (Series 4); and his sympathetic pushing enables his boss Haskins to ask for help when his wife goes missing after a breakdown, in \"Victims\" (Series 4); it's Regan who finds her. Regan can bend the rules in order to achieve the desired result: for example, fabricating evidence and arranging for a criminal to be kidnapped in \"Queen's Pawn\", and illegally entering private properties and threatening to lie about being attacked by a prisoner in order to get information in ''Regan''. Despite this, he's unwilling to cheat for personal gain: he delivers a sharp put-down to a corrupt copper in \"Bad Apple\", and refuses to take a bribe in \"Golden Fleece\".\n\nIn the Squad, informality is everything. Everyone calls DCI Haskins simply \"Haskins\" (except to his face), though Regan occasionally calls him by his first name, Frank. No one ever calls Regan \"Mister\"\u2014except the villains, or sometimes Carter when talking to Haskins. To the Squad, he is always simply \"the Guv'nor\", or just \"Guv\". In turn, he invariably calls Carter and the other Squad members by their first names. When off duty, he and George Carter are friends and drinking buddies, so in private Carter calls him \"Jack\". This is all in accordance with widespread police convention.\n\nRegan is driven around in a [[Ford Consul|Ford Consul (Granada Mark I based) (1972\u20131975)]] 3.0 GT. Although he is seen driving various cars himself in the series, he always has a driver\u2014usually Bill (an uncredited role played by Tony Allen)\u2014when using the Consul Granada (and the similar [[Ford Granada (Europe)|Ford Granada]] models used in later stories), which served as a Squad car: when the Squad travelled they always went \"mob handed\" (in considerable numbers). Regan is seen to also have his own car outside of the Squad, a [[Ford Cortina#Mark II (1966\u20131970)|Mark II Ford Cortina]].\n\n====George Carter====\n[[Dennis Waterman]] plays Detective Sergeant George Hamilton Carter who comes from [[south London]]; in the pilot episode, Regan seeks him out because of his knowledge of the south London area. His age is given in the episode \"Hit and Run\" as 26. In the series' timeline, we learn that George had previously been in the Squad, but had quit for family reasons (cf. ''Regan'' and \"Jigsaw\"). George was married to Alison Carter, a schoolteacher, but is widowed in the episode \"Hit and Run\" when Alison is murdered by mistake by a gang of diamond smugglers. He is a former amateur [[boxing|boxer]], as shown in the pilot ''Regan'', and is described as having professional boxing potential in the episode \"Chalk and Cheese\". Like his superior, he likes a drink (though less so than Regan), and appreciates [[football (soccer)|football]] and\u2014after the death of his wife\u2014attractive women. Carter isn't as potentially violent or aggressive as Regan, and usually plays the \"good cop\" role.\n\n====Frank Haskins====\n[[Garfield Morgan]] plays Detective Chief Inspector Frank Haskins, who is married with three children at boarding schools, and is Regan's immediate superior. Prior to the series timeline, the character had done \"[[National Service]] in the [[Royal Corps of Signals|Signals Corps]] in a minor intelligence role\" (as revealed in the episode \"Stay Lucky, Eh?\"). He is frequently seen at odds with Regan, preferring more conventional \"by-the-book\" policing methods.\n\nThe main \"Haskins episodes\" are \"Golden Fleece\", in which he is set up to be the victim of a corruption inquiry, and \"Victims\", in which his wife suffers a mental breakdown attributed to her memories of a miscarriage. Although he appeared in the opening titles of every episode of the first three series, he did not appear in all of them.\n\nThe character was not present at the start of the fourth, final series, and his role was taken by other superiors such as Detective Chief Inspector Anderson, played by [[Richard Wilson (Scottish actor)|Richard Wilson]], and Detective Chief Superintendent Braithwaite, played by [[Benjamin Whitrow]]. Haskins returned a few episodes into the fourth series. There are two versions of the fourth series opening credits\u2014one with and one without Haskins.\n\n===Other recurring characters===\n\n====The Squad====\nIn the early episodes, the team has a variety of drivers including Len ([[Jack McKenzie (actor)|Jack McKenzie]]) (the first two episodes) and Fred (Denis DeMarne) (in the episode \"Jigsaw\"). However, the episode \"The Placer\" in the first series introduces the character of Bill the driver (played by Tony Allen, who subsequently worked as wardrobe manager for many of John Thaw's later projects), and he remains a constant throughout the series, although he plays a peripheral, non-speaking role in most episodes.\n\nDetective Sergeant Tom Daniels ([[John Alkin]]) is the most prominent member of the supporting Squad. Other members include Sergeant Kent, Detective Constable Thorpe (Martin Read) and DS Matthews (John Flanagan) in the first series, DC Jerry Burtonshaw ([[Nick Brimble]]) (Series 1-2, 4) and DC Jellyneck (James Warrior) (Series 4). Detective Chief Superintendent Maynon ([[Morris Perry]]) appears occasionally as a senior officer, and is seen as being more willing than Haskins to bend the rules in order to get a result in the episode \"Queen's Pawn\". With Haskins absent, a semi-regular senior officer named DCS Braithwaite ([[Benjamin Whitrow]]) appears in Series 4.\n\n====Family====\nOther main characters include the close family of the three leads.\n\nRegan's ex-wife Kate appears in the episode \"Abduction\", after previously featuring in the pilot; and his daughter Susie ([[Jennifer Thanisch]]) appears in several episodes, most notably, \"Abduction\".\n\nCarter's wife Alison ([[Stephanie Turner]]) is seen attempting to prise him away from the Squad in the episode \"Jigsaw\", while her hostility toward Regan is apparent in the episode \"Abduction\". She is murdered in a case of mistaken identity in the episode \"Hit and Run\". In the DVD commentary for \"Abduction\", it is mentioned that the reason for this was that the actress (Stephanie Turner) was asking for too much money to continue to appear in the series. Her death was convenient for the show, releasing Carter to play a more freewheeling role, \"on the pull\"\u2014and allowing his banter with Regan, which had become a very popular part of the show, to develop further. Stephanie Turner went on to appear in ''[[Juliet Bravo]]'', also devised and part-written by Ian Kennedy Martin.\n\nDoreen Haskins features in some episodes, although the penultimate episode \"Victims\" deals with her deteriorating mental health and returns to the theme of the job's impact on family life. One of Haskins' three children, Richard, also appears in that episode.\n\n===Guest stars===\n<!---Alpha A-to-Z-Please--->\nGuest stars in the show included:\n\n{{Col-begin}}\n{{Col-break}}\n*[[Joss Ackland]]\n*[[Tony Anholt]]\n*[[Coral Atkins]]\n*[[Lynda Bellingham]]\n*[[Hywel Bennett]]\n*[[Brian Blessed]]\n*[[James Booth]]\n*[[Donald Burton]]\n*[[Simon Callow]]\n*[[Cheryl Campbell]]\n*[[Tony Caunter]]\n*[[Warren Clarke]]\n*[[George Cole (actor)|George Cole]] '''\u026b'''\n*[[Kenneth Colley]]\n*[[James Cosmo]]\n*[[John Rhys-Davies]]\n*[[Vernon Dobtcheff]]\n*[[Diana Dors]]\n*[[Colin Douglas (actor)|Colin Douglas]]\n*[[Lesley-Anne Down]]\n*[[Rosemarie Dunham]]\n*[[Michael Elphick]]\n*[[Arthur English]]\n{{Col-break}}\n*[[Norman Eshley]]\n*[[Derek Francis]]\n*[[Ronald Fraser (actor)|Ronald Fraser]]\n*[[Prunella Gee]]\n*[[Sheila Gish]]\n*[[Peter Glaze]]\n*[[Julian Glover]]\n*[[Brian Hall (actor)|Brian Hall]]\n*[[Cheryl Hall]]\n*[[Edward Hardwicke]]\n*[[Tina Heath]]\n*[[Ian Hendry]]\n*[[Del Henney]]\n*[[Paul Henry (actor)|Paul Henry]]\n*[[Julian Holloway]]\n*[[John Hurt]]\n*[[Ken Hutchison]]\n*[[Barrie Ingham]]\n*[[David Jackson (British actor)|David Jackson]]\n*[[Geraldine James]]\n*[[Peter Jeffrey]]\n*[[Paul Jones (singer)|Paul Jones]]\n*[[John Junkin]]\n{{Col-break}}\n*[[Roy Kinnear]]\n*[[Ronald Lacey]]\n*[[Alan Lake]]\n*[[Lynda La Plante]]\n*[[George Layton]]\n*[[Maureen Lipman]]\n*[[Sue Lloyd]]\n*[[David Lodge (actor)|David Lodge]]\n*[[Kenny Lynch]]\n*[[John Lyons (actor)|John Lyons]]\n*[[T.

Due to this, the number of different filming locations had to be restricted to 10, i.e. one location per day. At the Euston Films production office in [[St Paul's Juniors#History|Colet Court]], Hammersmith, a standing set of the Flying Squad offices (referred to as \"The Factory\" by the characters) was constructed which provided an alternative option for when inclement weather restricted the day's shooting. Two days would normally be spent filming on the set, equalling 10 minutes of any episode being set in the offices. Shooting took place through the spring, summer, autumn and winter months; exterior night shooting was expensive, and was limited to three minutes of external night material in any episode.\n\nEach episode had an eight-and-a-half-week production schedule: two weeks' pre-production (for [[Casting (performing arts)|casting]], finding locations etc.), two weeks' shooting, four weeks' picture [[editing]] (the first two weeks of which overlapped with the shoot), two weeks' sound editing, and two-and-a-half days' [[Dubbing (filmmaking)|dubbing]].\n\n===Filming locations===\nMost of the locations used for filming ''The Sweeney'' were around the west London area\u2014in particular, [[Acton, London|Acton]], [[Chiswick]], [[Shepherd's Bush]], [[Hammersmith]], [[Fulham]], [[Earl's Court]], [[Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea|Kensington & Chelsea]] and [[Notting Hill]] districts, close to the Euston Films HQ at Colet Court in Hammersmith. The [[London Docklands]], derelict at the time, were ideal for filming location sequences. The opening titles were filmed in Colet Gardens. However, other notable locations in London, the South East of England and further afield were also used for filming the show's episodes and included:\n\n*[[Chertsey]]/[[Penton Hook Lock]], [[Surrey]] - \"Thin Ice\", \"Bad Apple\", \"On the Run\", \"Feet of Clay\" & \"Jack or Knave?\".\n*[[Battersea]] - \"Jigsaw\", \"Stoppo Driver\", \"Faces\", \"Trap\", \"Trojan Bus\", \"Country Boy\", \"Visiting Fireman\", \"Tomorrow Man\", \"May\" & \"Victims\", \"Chalk & Cheese\" (Craven Arms, Lavender Hill)\n*[[Bermondsey]] - \"Regan\".\n*[[Black Park Country Park]], [[Wexham]], [[Buckinghamshire]] - \"Regan\", \"Payoff\", \"On the Run\" & \"Hearts & Minds\".\n*[[Dulwich]] - \"Regan\", \"Ringer\".\n*[[Dulwich Hamlet F.C.]] \"Ringer\".\n*[[Gozo]]/[[Malta#Islands|Maltese Archipelago]] - \"Sweeney 2\".\n*[[Earl's Court]] - \"Bait\" (Cromwell Crescent & Logan Place).\n*[[Earlsfield]] - Garratt Lane and Garratt Snooker Club - \"Supersnout\".\n*[[Hammersmith]] - \"Jackpot\".\n*[[Heathrow, London|Heathrow]] - \"Golden Boy\", \"Stoppo Driver\" & \"Tomorrow Man\".\n*[[Kingston upon Thames]] - \"Hit and Run\" & \"Trojan Bus\".\n*[[Ladbroke Grove]] - \"Hard Men\"\n*[[Maida Vale]] - \"Night Out\".\n*[[Peckham]] - \"Ringer\".\n*[[Potters Bar]], [[Hertfordshire]] - \"Big Spender\".\n*[[Putney]]/[[Putney Bridge]] \"Contact Breaker\", \"Abduction\" \"Taste of Fear\" & \"Sweeney 2\".\n*[[Queens Park Rangers F.C.]], [[Loftus Road]] - \"I Want the Man!\".\n*[[Raynes Park]] - \"Big Spender\", \"Golden Fleece\" & \"Victims\".\n*[[Richmond, London|Richmond]] (River Lane; Leonard Gold's house) -\"The Bigger They Are\"\n*[[Roehampton]] - \"Queen's Pawn\", \"Golden Fleece\" ([[Bank of England]] Sports Centre), \"Victims\" & \"Sweeney 2\" (Danebury Avenue/Alton Estate).\n*[[Sandown Park Racecourse]], [[Esher]], Surrey - \"Big Spender\".\n*[[Shepherd's Bush]] - \"Jackpot\".\n*[[Southall Gas Works]] - \"Faces\".\n*[[Southwark]] - \"Ringer\".\n*[[Staines]], [[Middlesex]] - \"The Placer\".\n*[[Tooting Bec]] - \"Abduction\" (Trinity Road & Tooting Bec Tube Station).\n*[[Twickenham]] - \"The Placer\", \"Golden Fleece\" ([[Twickenham Stadium]]) & \"Bad Apple\".\n*[[Uxbridge]] - \"Thou Shalt Not Kill\" ([[Brunel University]]) & \"Bad Apple\".\n*[[Wandsworth]] - \"Queens Pawn\", \"Jigsaw\", \"Abduction\", \"Country Boy\", \"Tomorrow Man\", \"May\", \"Drag Act\" & \"Sweeney 2\".\n*[[White City, London|White City]] - \"May\" ([[White City Stadium]]).\n*[[Wimbledon, London|Wimbledon]] - \"Contact Breaker\" ([[Wimbledon Stadium]]), \"Stay Lucky, Eh?\" \"May\", \"Lady Luck\" & \"Money, Money, Money\".\n*[[Wokingham]], [[Berkshire]] - \"Thin Ice\".\n\n==Episodes==\nA pilot episode, ''Regan'', was made as part of the ''Armchair Cinema'' series, first shown 4 June 1974.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Chibnall |first1=Steve |last2=Murphy |first2=Robert |title=British Crime Cinema |date=2005 |publisher=Routledge |isbn=9781134702701 |page=143 |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=jwyGAgAAQBAJ&pg=PA143&dq=Regan+%27%27Armchair+Cinema%27%27++4+June+1974&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjTwp6iqp3gAhXhSRUIHajsDIkQ6AEIKjAA#v=onepage&q&f=false |accessdate=2 February 2019 |language=en}}</ref> In all, four series were made with Series One being broadcast between January and March 1975 and Series Two following between September and November of the same year. Series Three was broadcast between September and December 1976, with the final series being shown two years later from September to December 1978. Two 90-minute feature films, ''Sweeney!'' and ''Sweeney 2'', were released in 1977 and 1978 respectively, between the third and fourth series.\n\n===Series 1===\nThe promotional episode shown to the press was \"Thin Ice\", which featured a relatively lightweight and somewhat humorous story, some comedy and international locations.\n\nEpisodes from the first series included \"Ringer\", where the team were attempting to prevent a criminal being sprung from prison, \"Jackpot\", \"Stoppo Driver\", and \"Abduction\" (in which Regan's daughter Susie was kidnapped), focusing on the strains which the job caused to family life. \"Jigsaw\" subtly illustrated the backgrounds and family lives of Regan and Carter; parallels are drawn between the unhappy situation of the main villain's family and Regan's own domestic situation.\n\nThe early episodes feature a great degree of hostility and mistrust between Regan and his senior officer, Haskins, who in one episode (\"Ringer\") attempts to separate Carter from Regan in order to help Carter's career.\n\nThe episode \"Queen's Pawn\" is a display of how Regan is willing to bend the rules in order to get a result, as he fabricates evidence, illegally opens private mail, and even arranges the kidnapping of one of the criminals in order to get the desired result.\n\n;Series 1 Episodes\n'''''All episodes were broadcast in 1975 on ITV, Thursdays at 21:00.''''' <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thesweeney.info/episodes.html |title=THE SWEENEY - Episode Guide |publisher=thesweeney.info |date=1974-06-04 |accessdate=2010-05-31}}{{dead link|date=September 2019}}</ref>\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"width:100%; margin:auto; background:#FFFFFF;\"\n|-\n! style=\"background-color: #dbe9f4; color:#000; text-align: center;\"|Episode No\n!! style=\"background-color: #dbe9f4; color:#000; text-align: center;\"|Title\n!! style=\"background-color: #dbe9f4; color:#000; text-align: center;\"|Original airdate\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber  = 1\n |Title          = Ringer\n |RTitle         = \n |OriginalAirDate= {{Start date|1975|1|2|df=y}}\n |ShortSummary   = Detective Inspector Jack Regan endangers an operation, and loses his girlfriend's car.\n |LineColor      = dbe9f4\n}}\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber  = 2\n |Title          = Jackpot\n |RTitle         = \n |OriginalAirDate= {{Start date|1975|1|9|df=y}}\n |ShortSummary   = Regan and his team are suspected of pocketing \u00a335,000.\n |LineColor      = dbe9f4\n}}\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber  = 3\n |Title          = Thin Ice\n |RTitle         = \n |OriginalAirDate= {{Start date|1975|1|16|df=y}}\n |ShortSummary   = Regan's determination to catch a crook leads to conflict with senior officers.\n |LineColor      = dbe9f4\n}}\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber  = 4\n |Title          = Queen's Pawn\n |RTitle         = \n |OriginalAirDate= {{Start date|1975|1|23|df=y}}\n |ShortSummary   = Three crooks walk out of court as free men.

The final series has been criticised as the weakest.{{citation needed|date=December 2013}} This decline in quality led John Thaw and Dennis Waterman to the realisation that the show was in danger of running out of steam, and to take the decision to end it while it was still at the peak of its popularity.\n\nNotable episodes include \"Nightmare\", which features a slightly experimental dream sequence as part of the plot. This is also the episode with the highest number of deaths, and features another then-contemporary plot of two ex-[[Provisional Irish Republican Army|IRA]] men committing a major crime in order to buy their way back into the organisation. \"Bait\" featured a performance by [[George Sewell]], who had starred in the Euston Films-produced episodes of an earlier police series, ''[[Special Branch (TV series)|Special Branch]]''; earlier still he had featured in the film ''[[Get Carter]]'', which was a major influence on ''The Sweeney'', and whose main character, Jack Carter, may have been the inspiration for the names of the two main ''Sweeney'' characters.\n\n\"Hearts and Minds\", the last episode to be filmed, featured the comedians [[Morecambe and Wise]], and was a quid pro quo for the appearance of Waterman and Thaw in a sketch in the 1976 ''[[Morecambe and Wise#Christmas specials|Morecambe and Wise Christmas show]]'' on the BBC.\n\nThe final broadcast episode, \"Jack or Knave?\", which aired on 28 December 1978, saw an ambiguous ending, with the main character, Jack Regan, temporarily locked up after being implicated in a corruption scandal, then finally being exonerated. He then announces that he's had it with the Squad, and the series ends with him resigning in disgust, but it's left open as to whether he would be persuaded to change his mind.\n\n;Series 4 Episodes\n'''''All episodes were broadcast in 1978 on ITV, Thursdays at 21:00.'''''\n\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"width:100%; margin:auto; background:#FFFFFF;\"\n|-\n! style=\"background-color: #dbe9f4; color:#000; text-align: right;\"|Ep.&nbsp;No\n!! style=\"background-color: #dbe9f4; color:#000; text-align: left;\"|Title\n!! style=\"background-color: #dbe9f4; color:#000; text-align: right;\"|Original airdate\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber  = 1\n |Title          = Messenger of the Gods\n |RTitle         = \n |OriginalAirDate= {{Start date|1978|9|7|df=y}}\n |ShortSummary   = \n |LineColor      = dbe9f4\n}}\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber  = 2\n |Title          = Hard Men\n |RTitle         = \n |OriginalAirDate= {{Start date|1978|9|14|df=y}}\n |ShortSummary   = \n |LineColor      = dbe9f4\n}}\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber  = 3\n |Title          = Drag Act\n |RTitle         = \n |OriginalAirDate= {{Start date|1978|9|21|df=y}}\n |ShortSummary   = \n |LineColor      = dbe9f4\n}}\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber  = 4\n |Title          = Trust Red\n |RTitle         = \n |OriginalAirDate= {{Start date|1978|9|28|df=y}}\n |ShortSummary   = \n |LineColor      = dbe9f4\n}}\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber  = 5\n |Title          = Nightmare\n |RTitle         = \n |OriginalAirDate= {{Start date|1978|10|5|df=y}}\n |ShortSummary   = \n |LineColor      = dbe9f4\n}}\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber  = 6\n |Title          = Money, Money, Money\n |RTitle         = \n |OriginalAirDate= {{Start date|1978|10|12|df=y}}\n |ShortSummary   = \n |LineColor      = dbe9f4\n}}\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber  = 7\n |Title          = Bait\n |RTitle         = \n |OriginalAirDate= {{Start date|1978|10|19|df=y}}\n |ShortSummary   = \n |LineColor      = dbe9f4\n}}\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber  = 8\n |Title          = The Bigger They Are\n |RTitle         = \n |OriginalAirDate= {{Start date|1978|10|26|df=y}}\n |ShortSummary   = \n |LineColor      = dbe9f4\n}}\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber  = 9\n |Title          = Feet of Clay\n |RTitle         = \n |OriginalAirDate= {{Start date|1978|11|2|df=y}}\n |ShortSummary   = \n |LineColor      = dbe9f4\n}}\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber  = 10\n |Title          = One of Your Own\n |RTitle         = \n |OriginalAirDate= {{Start date|1978|11|9|df=y}}\n |ShortSummary   = \n |LineColor      = dbe9f4\n}}\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber  = 11\n |Title          = Hearts and Minds\n |RTitle         = \n |OriginalAirDate= {{Start date|1978|11|23|df=y}}\n |ShortSummary   = \n |LineColor      = dbe9f4\n}}\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber  = 12\n |Title          = Latin Lady\n |RTitle         = \n |OriginalAirDate= {{Start date|1978|11|30|df=y}}\n |ShortSummary   = \n |LineColor      = dbe9f4\n}}\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber  = 13\n |Title          = Victims\n |RTitle         = \n |OriginalAirDate= {{Start date|1978|12|14|df=y}}\n |ShortSummary   = \n |LineColor      = dbe9f4\n}}\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber  = 14\n |Title          = Jack or Knave?\n |RTitle         = \n |OriginalAirDate= {{Start date|1978|12|28|df=y}}\n |ShortSummary   = \n |LineColor      = dbe9f4\n}}\n|}\n\nThe following episodes were shot in 1977: '''Messenger of The Gods''', '''Drag Act''', '''Trust Red''', '''Money, Money, Money''', '''Feet of Clay''', '''One of Your Own''' and '''Jack or Knave?'''.\n\nThe following episodes were shot in 1978: '''Hard Men''', '''Nightmare''', '''Bait''', '''The Bigger They Are''', '''Hearts and Minds''', '''Latin Lady''' and '''Victims'''.\n\n==Film adaptations==\n{{Main|Sweeney!|Sweeney 2|The Sweeney (2012 film)}}\nThe cinema spin-offs of ''The Sweeney'' feature the same actors and characters.

Edward Oliver]]. A trio of schoolboys played at being plain-clothes policemen, with two of them looking like little versions of Regan and Carter. They even had \"Flying Squad\" written on the side of their cartie.

(comics)|Thing]])\n\nDespite the show's title, the two segments remained separate and did not cross over with one another. The characters of [[Fred Flintstone]], [[Barney Rubble]] and [[Thing (comics)|Thing]] were only featured together during the opening title sequence and in brief bumpers between segments.<ref name=Daytime>{{cite book |last1=Hyatt |first1=Wesley |title=The Encyclopedia of Daytime Television |date=1997 |publisher=Watson-Guptill Publications |isbn=978-0823083152 |url=https://archive.org/details/encyclopediaofda00hyat/page/160/mode/2up|accessdate=19 March 2020|page=160}}</ref> The unusual combination of a Marvel superhero and ''The Flintstones'' was possible because, at this time, [[Marvel Comics]] owned the rights to several Hanna-Barbera franchises and were, in fact, publishing comic books based upon them; ''The Flintstones'' was one of these.\n\nFor the 1979\u201380 season, the series was expanded to a 90-minute timeslot with the addition of ''[[The New Shmoo]]'' episodes and broadcast under the new title '''''[[Fred and Barney Meet the Shmoo]]'''''.\n\nLike many animated series created by Hanna-Barbera in the 1970s, the show contained a [[Laugh track#Making their own|laugh track]], one of their last productions to do so.\n\n==The Thing==\nThe first segment, a very loose adaptation of [[Marvel Comics]]' character the [[Thing (comics)|Thing]], consisted of stories following the adventures of a scrawny, red-headed teenager named Benjy Grimm (voiced by Wayne Morton)<ref name=Perlmutter>{{cite book |last1=Perlmutter |first1=David |title=The Encyclopedia of American Animated Television Shows |date=2018 |publisher=Rowman & Littlefield |isbn=978-1538103739 |page=210}}</ref> who changes into the monstrous and mighty Thing (voiced by Joe Baker) by touching together magic rings and reciting the words \"Thing ring, do your thing!\", releasing an explosion of energy that causes orange rocks to hurl in from every direction and transform him into the stone-skinned superhero. When the Thing spoke, his good-naturedly gruff [[Brooklyn]]-accented voice was based on that of comedian [[Jimmy Durante]].\n\nThe stories centered mostly around Benjy at Centerville High School with his friends, the beautiful brunette Betty (voiced by [[Marilyn Schreffler]]), her snooty rich boyfriend Ronald Radford (voiced by [[John Erwin]]), and Betty's blond [[tomboy]] younger sister Kelly (voiced by Noelle North), with minimal adult supervision provided by teacher Miss Twilly (voiced by [[Marilyn Schreffler]]). Only Kelly and her scientist father Dr. Harkness (voiced by [[John Stephenson (actor)|John Stephenson]]) know Benjy's secret identity.\n\nWhen not battling various [[mad scientist]]s and getting involved in [[Scooby-Doo]]-style mysteries, the Thing spent most of his time using his superhuman strength to protect his pals from everyday dangers and the nasty [[practical joke]]s of leather-clad bully Spike (voiced by [[Art Metrano]]) and his biker buddies Stretch and Turkey in the [[Yancy Street Gang]].\n \nOther members of the [[Fantastic Four]] did not appear in the show, and the portrayal of the Thing and his origin story differed greatly from the original comics.<ref>{{cite news|title= Fantastic Four on TV|newspaper= [[IGN]]|publisher=[[Ziff Davis]]|date=|url= http://uk.tv.ign.com/articles/797/797130p2.html|accessdate=September 9, 2010}}</ref>\n\nTwenty-six 11-minute episodes of ''The Thing'' were produced; two shorts aired per show.\n\n''The Thing'' segments are owned by [[WarnerMedia]], through [[Hanna-Barbera]], [[Warner Bros. Animation]] and [[Warner Bros. Family Entertainment]], but the character is owned by [[The Walt Disney Company]] due to their purchase of Marvel Comics in late 2009.\n\n===Other appearances===\nIn ''[[Future Foundation|FF]]'' #8,
