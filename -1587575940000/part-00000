He debuted on-screen during the episode airing on 17 February 2006. Ste was created by David Hanson and was originally intended to be a short-term character for seven episodes. The following series producer [[Bryan Kirkwood (producer)|Bryan Kirkwood]] decided to bring the character back on a permanent basis. As of 2010, Richardson has revealed that he is committed to staying in the serial. In April 2017, Richardson began taking small breaks from the show due to paternity leave, and made a full-time return on 18 December 2017. In October 2019 it was confirmed that Richardson will take a break from the show departing on 20 November 2019. \n\nSte has been at the centre of several storylines including joyriding, domestic abuse, a baby kidnapping plot, drug dealing, HIV, far right radicalisation and a gay relationship. He was initially portrayed as a \"bad boy\" type character. Although he changed, producer [[Lucy Allan (producer)|Lucy Allan]] wanted him to revert. The issue of [[domestic violence]] has been portrayed through the character on two occasions: the first was his violence towards girlfriend [[Amy Barnes]] ([[Ashley Slanina-Davies]]), and the second when he suffered abuse from his boyfriend [[Brendan Brady]] ([[Emmett J. Scanlan]]). Richardson and co-star Slanina-Davies both fronted an anti-domestic abuse campaign called \"Expect Respect\" for [[Women's Aid Federation of England|Women's Aid]]. He has subsequent relationships with [[Rae Wilson]] ([[Alice Barlow]]) and [[Noah Baxter]] (Law Thompson) which become subject to love \"triangle\" storylines involving Brendan. Ste's gay storyline prompted Richardson to [[coming out|come out]] as gay. Its aim was to raise awareness of domestic abuse in a homosexual relationship. Whilst Ste and his storylines have received a mixed reaction from critics, Richardson has been nominated for various awards for his portrayal.\n\nOn 9 February 2020, Richardson, during his break from the show, revealed his return scenes would be filmed on 22 March and expected to air in June.\n\n==Character creation and casting==\nThe character of Ste was originally a background character, who was cast by David Hanson for only seven episodes.<ref name=\"more\">{{cite web |url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/soaps/s13/hollyoaks/scoop/a282075/more-from-hollyoaks-star-kieron-richardson.html |title=More from Hollyoaks star Kieron Richardson |work=[[Digital Spy]] |publisher=([[Hachette Filipacchi M\u00e9dias|Hachette Filipacchi UK]]) |first=Daniel |last=Kilkelly |date=14 October 2010 |accessdate=14 November 2010 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5vRcbHHt3?url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/soaps/s13/hollyoaks/scoop/a282075/more-from-hollyoaks-star-kieron-richardson.html|url-status=live |archivedate=2 January 2011 }}</ref> Upon completion of his initial short stint, new producer [[Bryan Kirkwood (producer)|Bryan Kirkwood]] decided to bring the character back for another handful of episodes, in October 2006, in which Ste fled the scene of a car accident involving [[Amy Barnes]] ([[Ashley Slanina-Davies]]).

They eventually come out as a couple after Leah prints out pictures of their text conversations when Ryan was AWOL and Leela finds them. She presents them at Amy's remembrance day and Ste and Ryan take a short break while Ryan thinks about his feelings. Even at Leela's disapproval, Ryan and Ste get back together. After job hunting for a while, Ryan tells Ste he got a great job in Brazil and Ste reluctantly agrees. As Ste gets more suspicious of Ryan, Ryan gets more desperate to leave the country before he can be arrested for the murder of Amy Barnes, Geoffrey Thorpe and the attempted murder of Tegan Lomax. When Ste finds out, he locks Ryan in Luke and Mandy's (Amy and Ryan's old) flat and tortures Ryan. Ryan escapes but is caught by the police.\n\nAfter Ste finds out that Ryan was the killer of one of the most important person in his life, He is so devastated that he fall in the drugs again. Harry finds him and convinces him to stop using the drugs and Ste kisses him. Harry suggests they go camping and that they still love each other, though Ste is not sure if he loves Harry. To please the kids they go camping and Ryan finds them. Ste later learns that Ryan is dead. Harry tells Ste that he left Ryan to drown and Ste doubts about their relationship. However, Ste quickly forgives him, because Harry is still the man he fell in love with, and accepts the earlier made proposal from him. Ste warns Harry multiple times to stay away from James as he tries to get his own business running, but finds out Harry hasn't been doing that when Harry gets arrested for smuggling in a phone. To explain himself Harry tells Ste he's been sleeping with random men for months and knows James didn't kill Kyle because Kyle was going to pay him for sex. Ste and Harry find Kyle and James gets released from jail. Tegan tells Ste that he should forgive Harry because of all the mistakes Ste has made in the last two years. Ste does this and the two get back together. When Tony goes missing Ste is the only person that continues to look for him and eventually finds him and brings him home. In October Ste and Harry gets married, but a few hours later Ste overhears a phone call between James and Harry and finds out that Harry has been having an affair with James for three months. The wedding day is targeted by Storm Belinda and Tegan is severely injured when a branch fall on her. In the hospital Ste asks Harry to stay with him but Harry tells Ste he is in love with James and cannot be there for him anymore. Later Tegan dies in the hospital due to complication from a surgery Misbah performed in the pawn shop. The next day Ste tells Harry to leave town and he starts his mission to destroy Misbah's career. To brighten up the day, however, Sinead has returned and Ste is soon enough reunited with his daughter Hannah. Though Laurie, was informed that Hannah dad was dead.\n\nAfter the death of Tegan and his failed marriage, Ste meet [[Jonny Baxter]] ([[Ray Quinn]]), who pretends to be a son of Pauline that she gave up shortly after giving birth. Where Ste's family questions this, Ste decides to believe Jonny's word and Jonny moves into the Lomax home. When Terry returns Jonny is there to support Ste through it and has Terry beaten up. Showing Ste that Jonny is a support that he can count on. Someone that has his back. Later Jonny introduces Ste to his friend Stuart Sumner, who is the head of a far right extremist group and it becomes clear that they have their eyes set on making Ste a part of their group. After manipulating the situation and feeding into Ste's anger over the Maaliks. Ste commits his first hate crime by smashing apart a bike belonging to Amir. Who he believes attacked Jonny. Peri has already caught on to Jonny racist opinions but Ste doesn't think they are that bad. When Leela comes back home from her trip away, she is informed about the memes Ste has made and the violence. Ste tries to convince her it was all justified but Leela point out she's not even sure who is talking any more at this point, but it's not Ste. She tells Ste it's either them or Jonny and Ste picks Jonny. Stuart buys Cindy's house and Jonny, Ste and the kids move in there. Tony is desperate to make Ste open his eyes and continues to reach out to him, he ends up discovering who Jonny and Stuart really are, pushing Jonny and Stuart to tell Ste about their movement. Once informed, Ste decides he wants to join them. After making a mistake costing them a legal protest march against the islamification of Britain, Ste organizes a new one, angry with Tony for ratting him out to the police after a violent outburst a day earlier. The illegal protest becomes violent and Ste is arrested. Afterwards both his family and friends along with Stuart and Jonny turn against him and Ste falls back on the booze. Peri tries to convince Ste to just apologize and come back home, but Ste decides to ask Stuart and Jonny for another chance. When he passes their test of loyalty, he gets the matching tattoo of the brotherhood and he has now officially joined. A week later Peri and Leela inform Ste that Jonny is not his brother. Despite being initially shocked at this reveal, Ste still decides that Jonny and Stuart are the ones he needs to be with and picks the brotherhood over his family. But there's more bad news for Ste as he discovers that Harry has been murdered, but doesn't know that Breda actually murdered him. He later feels guilty and tries to attempt to rebuild his relationship with him. A week after Harry's death, he discovers that Jonny and Stuart were actually far right extremists that ruined Sami's family including Yasmine who becomes deaf, he attempts to escaped which is a success after Stuart's son [[Sid Sumner]] (Billy Price), pushes his father to his death and Jonny gets arrested. After Stuart's death, the entire village turn against him including Yasmine because she blames him for ruining her family including her younger brother Irman being expelled from school and her mother nearly losing her job. He later sleeps with Sami's brother [[Azim Desai]], but he doesn't know if he is going to trust him or not. Ste later departs to visit Doug's relatives.\n\n==Reception==\n[[File:Kieron Richardson.jpg|thumb|200px|Kieron Richardson (''pictured'') has been nominated for several awards for his portrayal of Ste.]]\nRichardson has been nominated for several awards for his portrayal of Ste.

He debuted on-screen during the episode airing on 17 February 2006. Ste was created by David Hanson and was originally intended to be a short-term character for seven episodes. The following series producer [[Bryan Kirkwood (producer)|Bryan Kirkwood]] decided to bring the character back on a permanent basis. As of 2010, Richardson has revealed that he is committed to staying in the serial. In April 2017, Richardson began taking small breaks from the show due to paternity leave, and made a full-time return on 18 December 2017. In October 2019 it was confirmed that Richardson will take a break from the show departing on 20 November 2019. \n\nSte has been at the centre of several storylines including joyriding, domestic abuse, a baby kidnapping plot, drug dealing, HIV, far right radicalisation and a gay relationship. He was initially portrayed as a \"bad boy\" type character. Although he changed, producer [[Lucy Allan (producer)|Lucy Allan]] wanted him to revert. The issue of [[domestic violence]] has been portrayed through the character on two occasions: the first was his violence towards girlfriend [[Amy Barnes]] ([[Ashley Slanina-Davies]]), and the second when he suffered abuse from his boyfriend [[Brendan Brady]] ([[Emmett J. Scanlan]]). Richardson and co-star Slanina-Davies both fronted an anti-domestic abuse campaign called \"Expect Respect\" for [[Women's Aid Federation of England|Women's Aid]]. He has subsequent relationships with [[Rae Wilson]] ([[Alice Barlow]]) and [[Noah Baxter]] (Law Thompson) which become subject to love \"triangle\" storylines involving Brendan. Ste's gay storyline prompted Richardson to [[coming out|come out]] as gay. Its aim was to raise awareness of domestic abuse in a homosexual relationship. Whilst Ste and his storylines have received a mixed reaction from critics, Richardson has been nominated for various awards for his portrayal.\n\nOn 9 February 2020, Richardson, during his break from the show, revealed his return scenes would be filmed on 22 March and expected to air in June.\n\n==Character creation and casting==\nThe character of Ste was originally a background character, who was cast by David Hanson for only seven episodes.<ref name=\"more\">{{cite web |url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/soaps/s13/hollyoaks/scoop/a282075/more-from-hollyoaks-star-kieron-richardson.html |title=More from Hollyoaks star Kieron Richardson |work=[[Digital Spy]] |publisher=([[Hachette Filipacchi M\u00e9dias|Hachette Filipacchi UK]]) |first=Daniel |last=Kilkelly |date=14 October 2010 |accessdate=14 November 2010 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5vRcbHHt3?url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/soaps/s13/hollyoaks/scoop/a282075/more-from-hollyoaks-star-kieron-richardson.html|url-status=live |archivedate=2 January 2011 }}</ref> Upon completion of his initial short stint, new producer [[Bryan Kirkwood (producer)|Bryan Kirkwood]] decided to bring the character back for another handful of episodes, in October 2006, in which Ste fled the scene of a car accident involving [[Amy Barnes]] ([[Ashley Slanina-Davies]]).

His troublesome personality continued as he became a drug dealer, stole money and began hitting Amy.

Habsburg possessions bordered France in the [[Spanish Netherlands]], [[Franche-Comt\u00e9]], [[Alsace]], [[Roussillon]] and [[Duchy_of_Lorraine|Lorraine]] (see Map). France supported Habsburg opponents in the [[Thirty Years War]], the [[Eighty_Years'_War|Dutch Revolt]], and insurgencies in [[Portuguese_Restoration_War|Portugal]], [[Reapers' War|Catalonia]] and [[Kingdom_of_Naples|Naples]].{{sfn|Jensen|1985|pp=451-470}} \n\nFor their part, Spain and Austria financed Huguenot rebellions in South-Western France, and the [[C\u00e9vennes]], as well as internal conspiracies against the French government, led by [[Cardinal Richelieu]]. Although a major [[Battle_of_Castelnaudary|rebellion was defeated in 1632]], plotting continued, led by a mix of Huguenot exiles, and great feudal lords who resented their loss of power. Backed by Spanish money, some went to [[London]], seeking support from [[Charles I of England|Charles I]]; English foreign policy was generally pro-Spanish, but his wife was the [[Henrietta_Maria_of_France|younger sister of Louis XIII]], and the 1638 to 1651 [[War of the Three Kingdoms]] intervened.{{sfn|Wilson|2009|p=663}} \n\nFacing French-backed revolts in Catalonia and Portugal, in early 1641 Spanish chief minister [[Gaspar de Guzm\u00e1n, Count-Duke of Olivares|Olivares]] switched focus to the [[Louis de Bourbon, comte de Soissons|Comte de Soissons]] and [[Henry II, Duke of Guise|Henri II de Guise]]. Known as the 'Princes of Peace', since they claimed Richelieu was deliberately continuing the war to retain power, since 1637 they had been based in the [[Principality of Sedan]], then part of the [[Holy Roman Empire]].{{sfn|Elliott|1984|p=146}} This was held by the [[Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Maurice de La Tour d'Auvergne, duc de Bouillon|duc de Bouillon]]; like his younger brother, [[Henri_de_La_Tour_d'Auvergne,_Viscount_of_Turenne|Turenne]], Bouillon was brought up as a Protestant, and served with the Dutch army, before converting to Catholicism in 1634 and becoming a French general.{{sfn|Huberty, Giraud, Magdelaine|1985|pp=73,88}}\n\nThe French Army of Champagne occupied [[Duchy_of_Lorraine|Lorraine]] in 1634, then [[Breisach]] in 1638; by 1641, it was largely composed of low quality troops. All sides found it increasingly difficult to recruit and support armies on multiple fronts, so even a minor intervention could make a difference. Olivares planned simultaneous uprisings under Soissons in [[Principality of Sedan|Sedan]], with another in the south-western province of [[Guyenne]] that never materialised.{{sfn|Wilson|2009|p=664}} \n\nRichelieu was advised of the plot well in advance, and in April 1641, he ordered [[Gaspard_III_de_Coligny|Ch\u00e2tillon]] to invest Sedan; Ch\u00e2tillon objected, claiming to have less than 6,000 infantry and 1,400 cavalry, when he needed at least 8,000 infantry and 2,500 cavalry, plus a reserve force of 4,000 under Marquis de Sourdis.{{sfn|Parrott|2001|p=214}} In response to requests for support from Soissons, the [[Cardinal-Infante_Ferdinand_of_Austria|Governor of the Spanish Netherlands]] supplied him with money to recruit mercenaries, plus 7,000 men under [[Guillaume_de_Lamboy,_Baron_of_Cortesheim|Lamboy]].{{sfn|Parrott|2001|p=148}} \n\n==The battle==\n{{Location map many|France Grand Est|caption = Eastern France, 1634 to 1644 (major battles indicated by dates)|relief=yes|border = black| width = 300| float = right\n|label =  Sedan|pos=left|lat_deg= 49|lat_min= 42|lon_deg = 4|lon_min = 26\n|label3 = Thionville(1639) |pos3= bottom|lat3_deg=49|lat3_min = 22|lon3_deg = 6|lon3_min = 10\n|label4 = Nancy(1634) |pos4= bottom|lat4_deg=48|lat4_min = 42|lon4_deg = 6|lon4_min = 11\n|label5 = Raucourt |pos5= left|lat5_deg=48|lat5_min = 56|lon5_deg = 6|lon5_min = 13\n|label6 = Rethel|pos6=left|lat6_deg=49|lat6_min =31 |lon6_deg = 4 |lon6_min = 22\n|label7=  Strasbourg|pos7= bottom|lat7_deg = 48|lat7_min = 35|lon7_deg = 7|lon7_min = 45\n|label8 = Rocroi(1643)|pos8 = right|lat8_deg = 49 | lat8_min = 56 | lon8_deg = 4 | lon8_min = 31\n|label9 = Breisach(1638)|pos9 = left|lat9_deg = 48 | lat9_min = 02 | lon9_deg = 7 | lon9_min = 35\n|label10 = Philipsburg|pos10 = left|lat10_deg = 49 | lat10_min = 14 | lon10_deg = 8 | lon10_min = 27\n|label11 = Reims|pos11 = bottom|lat11_deg = 49 |lat11_min = 16 |lon11_deg = 4|lon11_min = 02\n|label12 = La Marf\u00e9e(1641)|pos12 = right|lat12_deg = 49 |lat12_min = 42 | lon12_deg = 4 |lon12_min = 56\n}}\nOn 25 June, the French occupied positions opposite Sedan on the eastern bank of the [[Meuse]], but they were dislodged by cannon fire from the town. Ch\u00e2tillon moved further up the Meuse, to [[Remilly-Aillicourt]], with Lamboy's troops on the opposite bank at [[Bazeilles]]. Here he waited for promised reinforcements from [[Charles_IV,_Duke_of_Lorraine|Charles of Lorraine]], which never arrived.{{sfn|De P\u00e9rini|1898|p=297}} \n\nSoissons and Bouillon left Sedan on 5 July with 3,000 French volunteers and [[Walloons|Walloon mercenaries]], taking position around the village of La Marf\u00e9e, where they were joined by Lamboy. The Spanish infantry deployed in a nearby wood under Lamboy, with Bouillon's cavalry on flat ground to their left, and Soissons with the reserve.{{sfn|Peyran|1826|pp=82\u201383}} \n\nThe morning of 6 July began with heavy rain, which delayed the French until after 10:00; they formed two columns, reaching La Marf\u00e9e an hour later. On arrival, Ch\u00e2tillon found his artillery, which consisted of four light guns, was in the rear, and so rather than waiting, sent his infantry into the woods.{{sfn|Puys\u00e9gur|1690|p=203}} \n\nThe Spanish initially gave ground, before the French ran into point blank artillery fire, and fell back. As they did so, Bouillon charged the French right; their commander, the Marquis de Praslin, was killed and his troops dissolved in panic, riding over their own infantry, who also broke. The cavalry on the left held their ground and retired in good order, but the battle was over in less than 45 minutes. The French lost 4,000 prisoners, plus their artillery and baggage train.{{sfn|De P\u00e9rini|1898|p=300}}\n\n==Aftermath==\n[[File:Frederic-Maurice de la Tour d'Auvergne, Duc de Bouillon LACMA AC1992.147.2.jpg|thumbnail|150px|left|[[Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Maurice de La Tour d'Auvergne, duc de Bouillon|duc de Bouillon]]]]\nCh\u00e2tillon, several of his senior officers, and 200 cavalry stopped at [[Rethel]], where they rallied the fugitives. Charles of Lorraine now joined Lamboy, who stopped to capture [[Donchery]], north of Sedan; this held them up until 14 July, allowing Ch\u00e2tillon and his remnants to reach [[Reims]]. Here they met [[Louis_XIII_of_France|Louis XIII]], and a small force under [[Urbain_de_Maill\u00e9-Br\u00e9z\u00e9|Maill\u00e9-Br\u00e9z\u00e9]].{{sfn|De P\u00e9rini|1898|p=300}}\n   \nSoissons died at the end of the action, apparently when a loaded pistol he was using to raise his helmet visor went off. Although his death ended the conspiracy, La Marf\u00e9e prevented Ch\u00e2tillon's army supporting the French offensive in [[Flanders]] as intended.{{sfn|Parrott|2001|p=148}} After [[Charles de La Porte|La Meilleraye]] captured [[Aire-sur-la-Lys]] on 27 July, Lamboy was sent north, where he joined the Cardinal-Infante; they re-captured [[Lillers]], then besieged Aire.{{sfn|Thion|2013|pp=27-28}} In an attempt to relieve the town, the French took [[Lens, Pas-de-Calais|Lens]], [[La Bass\u00e9e]] and [[Bapaume]], but Aire surrendered on 7 December.{{sfn|Parrott|2001|p=150}}    \n \nPlots against Richelieu continued until his death in December 1642, the most serious being that known as 'Cinq Mars' in June 1642. This featured many of those involved with Soissons, including [[Gaston, Duke of Orl\u00e9ans|Gaston of Orl\u00e9ans]], and the [[Henri Coiffier de Ruz\u00e9, Marquis of Cinq-Mars|Marquis de Cinq-Mars]], who was executed. Shortly before the French victory at [[Battle_of_Rocroi|Rocroi]] in May 1643, Louis XIII died, and was succeeded by his five year old son, [[Louis_XIV_of_France|Louis XIV]], a Regency Council ruling in his name.

Habsburg possessions bordered France in the [[Spanish Netherlands]], [[Franche-Comt\u00e9]], [[Alsace]], [[Roussillon]] and [[Duchy_of_Lorraine|Lorraine]] (see Map). France supported Habsburg opponents in the [[Thirty Years War]], the [[Eighty_Years'_War|Dutch Revolt]], and insurgencies in [[Portuguese_Restoration_War|Portugal]], [[Reapers' War|Catalonia]] and [[Kingdom_of_Naples|Naples]].{{sfn|Jensen|1985|pp=451-470}} \n\nFor their part, Spain and Austria financed Huguenot rebellions in South-Western France, and the [[C\u00e9vennes]], as well as internal conspiracies against the French government, led by [[Cardinal Richelieu]]. Although a major [[Battle_of_Castelnaudary|rebellion was defeated in 1632]], plotting continued, led by a mix of Huguenot exiles, and great feudal lords who resented their loss of power. Backed by Spanish money, some went to [[London]], seeking support from [[Charles I of England|Charles I]]; English foreign policy was generally pro-Spanish, but his wife was the [[Henrietta_Maria_of_France|younger sister of Louis XIII]], and the 1638 to 1651 [[War of the Three Kingdoms]] intervened.{{sfn|Wilson|2009|p=663}} \n\nFacing French-backed revolts in Catalonia and Portugal, in early 1641 Spanish chief minister [[Gaspar de Guzm\u00e1n, Count-Duke of Olivares|Olivares]] switched focus to the [[Louis de Bourbon, comte de Soissons|Comte de Soissons]] and [[Henry II, Duke of Guise|Henri II de Guise]]. Known as the 'Princes of Peace', since they claimed Richelieu was deliberately continuing the war to retain power, since 1637 they had been based in the [[Principality of Sedan]], then part of the [[Holy Roman Empire]].{{sfn|Elliott|1984|p=146}} This was held by the [[Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Maurice de La Tour d'Auvergne, duc de Bouillon|duc de Bouillon]]; like his younger brother, [[Henri_de_La_Tour_d'Auvergne,_Viscount_of_Turenne|Turenne]], Bouillon was brought up as a Protestant, and served with the Dutch army, before converting to Catholicism in 1634 and becoming a French general.{{sfn|Huberty, Giraud, Magdelaine|1985|pp=73,88}}\n\nThe French Army of Champagne occupied [[Duchy_of_Lorraine|Lorraine]] in 1634, then [[Breisach]] in 1638; by 1641, it was largely composed of low quality troops. All sides found it increasingly difficult to recruit and support armies on multiple fronts, so even a minor intervention could make a difference. Olivares planned simultaneous uprisings under Soissons in [[Sedan]], with another in the south-western province of [[Guyenne]] that never materialised.{{sfn|Wilson|2009|p=664}} \n\nRichelieu was advised of the plot well in advance, and in April 1641, he ordered [[Gaspard_III_de_Coligny|Ch\u00e2tillon]] to invest Sedan; Ch\u00e2tillon objected, claiming to have less than 6,000 infantry and 1,400 cavalry, when he needed at least 8,000 infantry and 2,500 cavalry, plus a reserve force of 4,000 under Marquis de Sourdis.{{sfn|Parrott|2001|p=214}} In response to requests for support from Soissons, the [[Cardinal-Infante_Ferdinand_of_Austria|Governor of the Spanish Netherlands]] supplied him with money to recruit mercenaries, plus 7,000 men under [[Guillaume_de_Lamboy,_Baron_of_Cortesheim|Lamboy]].{{sfn|Parrott|2001|p=148}} \n\n==The battle==\n{{Location map many|France Grand Est|caption = Eastern France, 1634 to 1644 (major battles indicated by dates)|relief=yes|border = black| width = 300| float = right\n|label =  Sedan|pos=left|lat_deg= 49|lat_min= 42|lon_deg = 4|lon_min = 26\n|label3 = Thionville(1639) |pos3= bottom|lat3_deg=49|lat3_min = 22|lon3_deg = 6|lon3_min = 10\n|label4 = Nancy(1634) |pos4= bottom|lat4_deg=48|lat4_min = 42|lon4_deg = 6|lon4_min = 11\n|label5 = Raucourt |pos5= left|lat5_deg=48|lat5_min = 56|lon5_deg = 6|lon5_min = 13\n|label6 = Rethel|pos6=left|lat6_deg=49|lat6_min =31 |lon6_deg = 4 |lon6_min = 22\n|label7=  Strasbourg|pos7= bottom|lat7_deg = 48|lat7_min = 35|lon7_deg = 7|lon7_min = 45\n|label8 = Rocroi(1643)|pos8 = right|lat8_deg = 49 | lat8_min = 56 | lon8_deg = 4 | lon8_min = 31\n|label9 = Breisach(1638)|pos9 = left|lat9_deg = 48 | lat9_min = 02 | lon9_deg = 7 | lon9_min = 35\n|label10 = Philipsburg|pos10 = left|lat10_deg = 49 | lat10_min = 14 | lon10_deg = 8 | lon10_min = 27\n|label11 = Reims|pos11 = bottom|lat11_deg = 49 |lat11_min = 16 |lon11_deg = 4|lon11_min = 02\n|label12 = La Marf\u00e9e(1641)|pos12 = right|lat12_deg = 49 |lat12_min = 42 | lon12_deg = 4 |lon12_min = 56\n}}\nOn 25 June, the French occupied positions opposite Sedan on the eastern bank of the [[Meuse]], but they were dislodged by cannon fire from the town. Ch\u00e2tillon moved further up the Meuse, to [[Remilly-Aillicourt]], with Lamboy's troops on the opposite bank at [[Bazeilles]]. Here he waited for promised reinforcements from [[Charles_IV,_Duke_of_Lorraine|Charles of Lorraine]], which never arrived.{{sfn|De P\u00e9rini|1898|p=297}} \n\nSoissons and Bouillon left Sedan on 5 July with 3,000 French volunteers and [[Walloons|Walloon mercenaries]], taking position around the village of La Marf\u00e9e, where they were joined by Lamboy. The Spanish infantry deployed in a nearby wood under Lamboy, with Bouillon's cavalry on flat ground to their left, and Soissons with the reserve.{{sfn|Peyran|1826|pp=82\u201383}} \n\nThe morning of 6 July began with heavy rain, which delayed the French until after 10:00; they formed two columns, reaching La Marf\u00e9e an hour later. On arrival, Ch\u00e2tillon found his artillery, which consisted of four light guns, was in the rear, and so rather than waiting, sent his infantry into the woods.{{sfn|Puys\u00e9gur|1690|p=203}} \n\nThe Spanish initially gave ground, before the French ran into point blank artillery fire, and fell back. As they did so, Bouillon charged the French right; their commander, the Marquis de Praslin, was killed and his troops dissolved in panic, riding over their own infantry, who also broke. The cavalry on the left held their ground and retired in good order, but the battle was over in less than 45 minutes. The French lost 4,000 prisoners, plus their artillery and baggage train.{{sfn|De P\u00e9rini|1898|p=300}}\n\n==Aftermath==\n[[File:Frederic-Maurice de la Tour d'Auvergne, Duc de Bouillon LACMA AC1992.147.2.jpg|thumbnail|150px|left|[[Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Maurice de La Tour d'Auvergne, duc de Bouillon|duc de Bouillon]]]]\nCh\u00e2tillon, several of his senior officers, and 200 cavalry stopped at [[Rethel]], where they rallied the fugitives. Charles of Lorraine now joined Lamboy, who stopped to capture [[Donchery]], north of Sedan; this held them up until 14 July, allowing Ch\u00e2tillon and his remnants to reach [[Reims]]. Here they met [[Louis_XIII_of_France|Louis XIII]], and a small force under [[Urbain_de_Maill\u00e9-Br\u00e9z\u00e9|Maill\u00e9-Br\u00e9z\u00e9]].{{sfn|De P\u00e9rini|1898|p=300}}\n   \nSoissons died at the end of the action, apparently when a loaded pistol he was using to raise his helmet visor went off. Although his death ended the conspiracy, La Marf\u00e9e prevented Ch\u00e2tillon's army supporting the French offensive in [[Flanders]] as intended.{{sfn|Parrott|2001|p=148}} After [[Charles de La Porte|La Meilleraye]] captured [[Aire-sur-la-Lys]] on 27 July, Lamboy was sent north, where he joined the Cardinal-Infante; they re-captured [[Lillers]], then besieged Aire.{{sfn|Thion|2013|pp=27-28}} In an attempt to relieve the town, the French took [[Lens, Pas-de-Calais|Lens]], [[La Bass\u00e9e]] and [[Bapaume]], but Aire surrendered on 7 December.{{sfn|Parrott|2001|p=150}}    \n \nPlots against Richelieu continued until his death in December 1642, the most serious being that known as 'Cinq Mars' in June 1642. This featured many of those involved with Soissons, including [[Gaston, Duke of Orl\u00e9ans|Gaston of Orl\u00e9ans]], and the [[Henri Coiffier de Ruz\u00e9, Marquis of Cinq-Mars|Marquis de Cinq-Mars]], who was executed. Shortly before the French victory at [[Battle_of_Rocroi|Rocroi]] in May 1643, Louis XIII died, and was succeeded by his five year old son, [[Louis_XIV_of_France|Louis XIV]], a Regency Council ruling in his name. This resulted in a power struggle between the [[Anne_of_Austria|Queen Mother]], supported by [[Cardinal Mazarin]], and [[Louis II de Bourbon, Prince of Cond\u00e9|Cond\u00e9]], victor of Rocroi, a member of the royal family, and effective ruler of large parts of eastern France.{{sfn|Monter|2007|p=118}}\n\nWhen Cond\u00e9 was arrested during the 1648 to 1653 [[Fronde]], Bouillon and Turenne joined forces to demand his release.

The capital was also known as Virakshetra or Viravati (Land of Warriors). Later on, it was known as Vadpatraka or Vadodar\u00e1, which according to tradition is a corrupt form of the [[Sanskrit]] word ''vatodar'' meaning in the belly of the Banyan tree.

Most notably, from 1705\u20131716, Sardar [[Senapati]] Khanderao Dabhade led the Maratha Empire forces in Baroda. Except for a short period, Baroda continued to be in the reign of the Gaekwads from 1734 to 1948. Initially detailed to collect revenue on behalf of the [[Peshwa]] in Gujarat, [[Pilaji Gaekwad]] remained there to carve out a kingdom for himself. Damajirao, who was son and successor of Pilaji Gaekwad, defeated the Mughal armies and conquered Baroda in 1734.<ref name=\"Gaekwad\"/> His successors consolidated their power over large tracts of Gujarat, becoming easily the most powerful rulers in the region.\n\nAfter the Maratha defeat in the [[Third Battle of Panipat]] in 1761,<ref name=\"Gaekwad\"/> control of the empire by the Peshwas weakened as it became a loose [[Confederation|confederacy]], and the Gaekwad [[Maharaja]]s ruled the kingdom until it [[Instrument of Accession|acceded]] to Independent [[Republic of India]] in 1949. In 1802,<ref name=\"Gaekwad\"/> the British intervened to defend a [[Maharaja]] that had recently inherited the throne from rival claimants, and Vadodara concluded a [[subsidiary alliance]] with the British that recognised the Kingdom as a [[Princely state]] and allowed the Maharajas of Baroda internal political sovereignty in return for recognising British 'Paramountcy', a form of [[suzerainty]] in which the control of the state's foreign affairs was completely surrendered. {{citation needed|date=January 2015}}\n\nThe golden period in the Maratha rule of Vadodara started with the accession of [[Maharaja Sayajirao Gaekwad III|Maharaja Sayajirao III]] in 1875.<ref name=\"Gaekwad\"/>\n\n==Geography==\nVadodara is located at {{coord|22.30|N|73.19|E|}} in western India at an elevation of {{convert|39|m}}.

The capital was also known as Virakshetra or Viravati (Land of Warriors). Later on, it was known as Vadpatraka or Vadodar\u00e1, which according to tradition is a corrupt form of the [[Sanskrit]] word ''vatodar'' meaning in the belly of the Banyan tree.

Except for a short period, Baroda continued to be in the reign of the Gaekwads from 1734 to 1948. Initially detailed to collect revenue on behalf of the [[Peshwa]] in Gujarat, [[Pilaji Gaekwad]] remained there to carve out a kingdom for himself. Damajirao, who was son and successor of Pilaji Gaekwad, defeated the Mughal armies and conquered Baroda in 1734.<ref name=\"Gaekwad\"/> His successors consolidated their power over large tracts of Gujarat, becoming easily the most powerful rulers in the region.\n\nAfter the Maratha defeat in the [[Third Battle of Panipat]] in 1761,<ref name=\"Gaekwad\"/> control of the empire by the Peshwas weakened as it became a loose [[Confederation|confederacy]], and the Gaekwad [[Maharaja]]s ruled the kingdom until it [[Instrument of Accession|acceded]] to Independent [[Republic of India]] in 1949. In 1802,<ref name=\"Gaekwad\"/> the British intervened to defend a [[Maharaja]] that had recently inherited the throne from rival claimants, and Vadodara concluded a [[subsidiary alliance]] with the British that recognised the Kingdom as a [[Princely state]] and allowed the Maharajas of Baroda internal political sovereignty in return for recognising British 'Paramountcy', a form of [[suzerainty]] in which the control of the state's foreign affairs was completely surrendered. {{citation needed|date=January 2015}}\n\nThe golden period in the Maratha rule of Vadodara started with the accession of [[Maharaja Sayajirao Gaekwad III|Maharaja Sayajirao III]] in 1875.<ref name=\"Gaekwad\"/>\n\n==Geography==\nVadodara is located at {{coord|22.30|N|73.19|E|}} in western India at an elevation of {{convert|39|m}}.
