The first widow remarriage took place on 11 December 1881. A society with 16 members was started on 22 June 1884, which used to look after widow remarriages in Rajahmundry. The town hall was established in 1890 by Veeresalingam. [[Bipin Chandra Pal]] visited Rajahmundry in April 1905 during the Vandemataram Movement. During his visits, he used to address the public in \"Pal Chowk\" (the present-day Kotipalli Bus Stand). [[Annie Besant]] visited Rajahmundry twice.

When the [[Indian National Congress]] had its first meeting in Bombay (Mumbai), two leaders from Rajahmundry, Nyapathi Subba Rao and Kandukuri Veeresalingam, participated in it. Subba Rao, founder of Hindu Samaj in Rajahmundry, was also one of the six founders of India's noted English daily, ''[[The Hindu]]''.\n\nThe Renaissance of Andhra Pradesh started in Rajahmundry. [[Kandukuri Veeresalingam]] is known as the Father of reforms in Andhra Pradesh. He started a monthly magazine Vivekavardhini, and a school for girls at [[Dowleswaram]] in 1874. The first widow remarriage took place on 11 December 1881. A society with 16 members was started on 22 June 1884, which used to look after widow remarriages in Rajahmundry. The town hall was established in 1890 by Veeresalingam. [[Bipin Chandra Pal]] visited Rajahmundry in April 1905 during the Vandemataram Movement. During his visits, he used to address the public in \"Pal Chowk\" (the present-day Kotipalli Bus Stand). [[Annie Besant]] visited Rajahmundry twice. First, she came during the foundations of a branch of the Divya Gyan Samaj at Alcot Gardens were being laid. She came again during the opening ceremony. Ramakrishna Mission was established in the city during 1950\u201351 near Kambal tank. The place is now the Ayakar Bhavan.\n\nRajahmundry is acclaimed as the birthplace of the [[Telugu language]]\u2014its grammar and script evolved from the pen of the city-born poet [[Nannayya]]. Also known as '\u0100di Kavi' (the first poet) of Telugu, Nannayya, along with [[Tikkana]] and [[Yerrana]], translated the [[Sanskrit]] version of [[Mahabharata]] into Telugu.

Although originally formulated in terms of species within a genus, it has often been recast in terms of populations within a species. It is also often cast in terms of latitude. It is possible that the rule also applies to some plants, such as ''[[Rapicactus]]''.\n\nThe rule is named after nineteenth century [[Germany|German]] biologist [[Carl Bergmann (anatomist)|Carl Bergmann]], who described the pattern in 1847; however, he was not the first to notice this pattern.

Some{{Who|date=September 2019}} believe that latitude itself is a poor predictor of body mass. Examples of other selective factors that may contribute to body mass changes are the size of food items available, effects of body size on success as a [[predator]], effects of body size on vulnerability to predation, and resource availability. For example, if an organism is adapted to tolerate cold temperatures, it may also tolerate periods of food shortage, due to correlation between cold temperature and food scarcity.<ref name=\"Ashton2000\"/> A larger organism can rely on its greater fat stores to provide the energy needed for survival as well being able to procreate for longer periods.\n\nResource availability is a major constraint on the overall success of many organisms. Resource scarcity can limit the total number of organisms in a habitat, and over time can also cause organisms to adapt by becoming smaller in body size.

Warmer climates impose the opposite problem: body heat generated by metabolism needs to be dissipated quickly rather than stored within.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">{{cite journal |last1=Brown |first1=James H. |first2=Anthony K. |last2=Lee |title=Bergmann's Rule and Climatic Adaptation in Woodrats (Neotoma) |journal=[[Evolution (journal)|Evolution]] |volume=23 |issue=2 |pages=329\u2013338 |date=January 1969 |jstor=2406795 |doi=10.2307/2406795}}</ref>\n\nThus, the higher surface area-to-volume ratio of smaller animals in hot and dry climates facilitates heat loss through the skin and helps cool the body. It is important to note that when analyzing Bergmann's Rule in the field that groups of populations being studied are of different thermal environments, and also have been separated long enough to genetically differentiate in response to these thermal conditions.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\nIn marine [[crustacean]]s, it has been proposed that an increase in size with latitude is observed because decreasing temperature results in increased [[Cell (biology)|cell]] size and increased [[Longevity|life span]], both of which lead to an increase in maximum body size (continued growth throughout life is characteristic of crustaceans).<ref name=\"Timofeev2001\"/> The size trend has been observed in [[Hyperiidae|hyperiid]] and [[gammarid]] [[amphipod]]s, [[copepod]]s, [[stomatopod]]s, [[mysid]]s, and planktonic [[euphausiid]]s, both in comparisons of related species as well as within widely distributed species.<ref name=\"Timofeev2001\"/> [[Deep-sea gigantism]] is observed in some of the same groups, possibly for the same reasons.<ref name=\"Timofeev2001\"/> An additional factor in aquatic species may be the greater dissolved oxygen concentration at lower temperature.

Hesse's rule, also known as the heart\u2013weight rule, states that species inhabiting colder climates have a larger heart in relation to body weight than closely related species inhabiting warmer climates.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://stommel.tamu.edu/~baum/paleo/paleogloss/node19.html#HessesRule| title=Hesse's rule| first=Steven| last=Baum| date=January 20, 1997| work=Glossary of Oceanography and the Related Geosciences with References| publisher=Texas Center for Climate Studies, Texas A&M University| accessdate=2011-01-09| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101222133540/http://stommel.tamu.edu/~baum/paleo/paleogloss/node19.html#HessesRule| archive-date=December 22, 2010| url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n==Criticism==\nIn a 1986 study, [[Valerius Geist]] claimed Bergmann's rule to be false: the correlation with temperature is spurious; instead, Geist found that body size is proportional to the duration of the annual productivity pulse, or food availability per animal during the growing season.<ref name=\"Geist1987\">{{Cite journal | doi=10.1139/z87-164| title=Bergmann's rule is invalid| journal=[[Canadian Journal of Zoology]]| volume=65| issue=4| pages=1035\u20131038| date=April 1987| last1=Geist | first1=Valerius }}</ref>\n\nBecause many factors can affect body size, there are many critics of Bergmann's Rule. Some{{Who|date=September 2019}} believe that latitude itself is a poor predictor of body mass. Examples of other selective factors that may contribute to body mass changes are the size of food items available, effects of body size on success as a [[predator]], effects of body size on vulnerability to predation, and resource availability. For example, if an organism is adapted to tolerate cold temperatures, it may also tolerate periods of food shortage, due to correlation between cold temperature and food scarcity.<ref name=\"Ashton2000\"/> A larger organism can rely on its greater fat stores to provide the energy needed for survival as well being able to procreate for longer periods.\n\nResource availability is a major constraint on the overall success of many organisms. Resource scarcity can limit the total number of organisms in a habitat, and over time can also cause organisms to adapt by becoming smaller in body size. Resource availability thus becomes a modifying restraint on Bergmann's Rule.<ref name=\"Clauss2013\">{{Cite journal | doi=10.1111/j.1600-0706.2013.00463.x| title=Bergmann\u2032s rule in mammals: A cross-species interspecific pattern| journal=[[Oikos (journal)|Oikos]] |volume=122| issue=10| pages=1465\u20131472| date=October 2013 | last1=Clauss | first1=Marcus | last2=Dittmann | first2=Marei T. | last3=M\u00fcller | first3=Dennis W.

The [[Coach (vehicle)|coach]] road from London to [[Guildford]] ran slightly south of the future station site, past ''[[Falcon, Battersea|The Falcon]]'' [[public house]] at the crossroads in the valley between St. John's Hill and Lavender Hill.\n\nOn 21 May 1838 the London and Southampton Railway became the [[London and South Western Railway]] (L&SWR), and opened its line from {{rws|Nine Elms}} as far as [[Woking]]. That was the first railway through the area but it had no station at the present site.\n\n[[File:Clapham Junction Railway Station - Detail of Roof Columns - London - 240404.jpg|thumb|left|Details of roof support columns]]\nThe second line, initially from Nine Elms to [[Richmond (London) station|Richmond]], opened on 27 July 1846. Nine Elms was replaced in 1848 as the terminus by Waterloo Bridge station, now Waterloo. The line to Victoria opened by 1860. Clapham Junction opened on 2 March 1863, a joint venture of the L&SWR, the [[London, Brighton and South Coast Railway]] (LB&SCR) and the [[West London Line|West London Extension Railway]] (WLER) as an interchange station for their lines.<ref>The west London Railway and the W.L.E.R, H.V.Borley & R.W.Kidner, 1981 reprint, The Oakwood Press, Usk Monmouthshire. {{ISBN|0-85361-174-2}}</ref>\n\nWhen the station was built, much of [[Battersea]] was the site of heavy industry while [[Clapham]], a mile south-east of this point, was fashionable. The railway companies, to attract a middle- and upper-class clientele, seized the unindustrial [[ecclesiastical parish|parish]] calculating that being upon the slopes of Clapham's plateau would only re-inforce this distinction, leading to a long-lasting misunderstanding that the station is in Clapham. The railway companies were not alone in eschewing the name of Battersea; from the 1880s until the 1950s the imposing private houses forming the streets of the district were commonly recorded by property-owning residents as 'Clapham Common N.

The most heavily used of the three, this leads from St John's Hill via a small indoor shopping centre into a subway some 15&nbsp;ft (4.6&nbsp;m) wide, that connects to the eastern ends of all platforms.\n\nThe north entrance, which has restricted opening hours, leads from Grant Road to the same subway. The subway is crowded during rush hours, with the [[turnstile|ticket barriers]] at the ends being pinch points.\n\nThe south-west entrance, also known as the Brighton Yard entrance, as the buildings still bear signage for the London Brighton and South Coast Railway, is of a more traditional appearance, with a Victorian station building set at the back of a large forecourt.  This entrance leads to a very wide covered footbridge, which joins the western ends of all platforms.  This entrance includes cycle parking and a taxi rank. It was re-opened in May 2011 as part of a wider programme of access improvements that included installing lifts to the platforms.<ref name=\"Improvements\">[http://www.networkrail.co.uk/browse%20documents/BusinessPlan2007/PDF/Route%203%20South%20West%20Main%20Line.pdf Route Plans 2007&nbsp;\u2013 Route 3&nbsp;\u2013 South West Main line] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080229173701/http://www.networkrail.co.uk/browse%20documents/BusinessPlan2007/PDF/Route%203%20South%20West%20Main%20Line.pdf |date=29 February 2008 }} published by Network Rail, 2007&nbsp;\u2013 See page 20</ref>\n\nThere are public and disabled toilets at the south-west entrance.

The [[Coach (vehicle)|coach]] road from London to [[Guildford]] ran slightly south of the future station site, past ''[[Falcon, Battersea|The Falcon]]'' [[public house]] at the crossroads in the valley between St. John's Hill and Lavender Hill.\n\nOn 21 May 1838 the London and Southampton Railway became the [[London and South Western Railway]] (L&SWR), and opened its line from {{rws|Nine Elms}} as far as [[Woking]]. That was the first railway through the area but it had no station at the present site.\n\n[[File:Clapham Junction Railway Station - Detail of Roof Columns - London - 240404.jpg|thumb|left|Details of roof support columns]]\nThe second line, initially from Nine Elms to [[Richmond (London) station|Richmond]], opened on 27 July 1846. Nine Elms was replaced in 1848 as the terminus by Waterloo Bridge station, now Waterloo. The line to Victoria opened by 1860. Clapham Junction opened on 2 March 1863, a joint venture of the L&SWR, the [[London, Brighton and South Coast Railway]] (LB&SCR) and the [[West London Line|West London Extension Railway]] (WLER) as an interchange station for their lines.<ref>The west London Railway and the W.L.E.R, H.V.Borley & R.W.Kidner, 1981 reprint, The Oakwood Press, Usk Monmouthshire. {{ISBN|0-85361-174-2}}</ref>\n\nWhen the station was built, much of [[Battersea]] was the site of heavy industry while [[Clapham]], a mile south-east of this point, was fashionable. The railway companies, to attract a middle- and upper-class clientele, seized the unindustrial [[ecclesiastical parish|parish]] calculating that being upon the slopes of Clapham's plateau would only re-inforce this distinction, leading to a long-lasting misunderstanding that the station is in Clapham. The railway companies were not alone in eschewing the name of Battersea; from the 1880s until the 1950s the imposing private houses forming the streets of the district were commonly recorded by property-owning residents as 'Clapham Common N. Side, London' and 'Clapham Common W. Side, London' despite being well away from those park-side streets.<ref>[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=wLssAQAAIAAJ ''Year's Art''], published 1922, London, p. 500</ref><ref>[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=GkThQYLb3ZUC Directory of British Architects, 1834\u20131914: Vol. 2 (L-Z)] A.

Battersea's slums unfit for human habitation were entirely replaced with [[social housing|council and charitable housing]] between 1918 and 1975.\n [[File:Maintaining the Railway - geograph.org.uk - 581736.jpg|thumb|A [[British Rail Class 73]] with track workers maintaining the railway in 1986 under [[British Rail]].]]\n\n===Discontinued proposals===\nA \u00a339.5&nbsp;million planning application from Metro Shopping Fund was withdrawn before governmental planning committee consideration on 20 May 2009.{{refn|group=n|The 2009 ''Metro Shopping'' company plan included a new entrance on St John's Hill, the straightening and extension of platforms 15 to 17, more ticketing facilities, step-free access to all platforms by 2011, a new step-free entrance on Grant Road, and a new 'high street' from St John's Hill to Falcon Road with retail space and arthouse cinema.

The most heavily used of the three, this leads from St John's Hill via a small indoor shopping centre into a subway some 15&nbsp;ft (4.6&nbsp;m) wide, that connects to the eastern ends of all platforms.\n\nThe north entrance, which has restricted opening hours, leads from Grant Road to the same subway. The subway is crowded during rush hours, with the [[turnstile|ticket barriers]] at the ends being pinch points.\n\nThe south-west entrance, also known as the Brighton Yard entrance, as the buildings still bear signage for the London Brighton and South Coast Railway, is of a more traditional appearance, with a Victorian station building set at the back of a large forecourt.  This entrance leads to a very wide covered footbridge, which joins the western ends of all platforms.  This entrance includes cycle parking and a taxi rank. It was re-opened in May 2011 as part of a wider programme of access improvements that included installing lifts to the platforms.<ref name=\"Improvements\">[http://www.networkrail.co.uk/browse%20documents/BusinessPlan2007/PDF/Route%203%20South%20West%20Main%20Line.pdf Route Plans 2007&nbsp;\u2013 Route 3&nbsp;\u2013 South West Main line] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080229173701/http://www.networkrail.co.uk/browse%20documents/BusinessPlan2007/PDF/Route%203%20South%20West%20Main%20Line.pdf |date=29 February 2008 }} published by Network Rail, 2007&nbsp;\u2013 See page 20</ref>\n\nThere are public and disabled toilets at the south-west entrance.
