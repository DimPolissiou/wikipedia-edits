Application (or repeated application) of the rule often converts an indeterminate form to an expression that can be easily evaluated by substitution. The rule is named after the 17th-century [[France|French]] [[mathematician]] [[Guillaume de l'H\u00f4pital]]. Although the rule is often attributed to L'H\u00f4pital, the theorem was first introduced to him in 1694 by the Swiss mathematician [[Johann Bernoulli]].\n\nL'H\u00f4pital's rule states that for functions {{mvar|f}} and {{mvar|g}} which are [[Differentiable function|differentiable]] on an open [[Interval (mathematics)|interval]] {{mvar|I}} except possibly at a point {{mvar|c}} contained in {{mvar|I}}, if <math>\\lim_{x\\to c}f(x)=\\lim_{x\\to c}g(x)=0 \\text{ or } \\pm\\infty,</math> <math>g'(x)\\ne 0</math> for all {{mvar|x}} in {{mvar|I}} with {{math|1=''x'' \u2260 ''c''}}, and <math>\\lim_{x\\to c}\\frac{f'(x)}{g'(x)}</math> exists, then\n:<math>\\lim_{x\\to c}\\frac{f(x)}{g(x)} = \\lim_{x\\to c}\\frac{f'(x)}{g'(x)}.</math>\n\nThe differentiation of the numerator and denominator often simplifies the quotient or converts it to a limit that can be evaluated directly.\n\n== History ==\n\n[[Guillaume de l'H\u00f4pital]] (also written l'Hospital{{efn|In the 17th and 18th centuries, the name was commonly spelled \"l'Hospital\", and he himself spelled his name that way.

Let {{math|''c''}} and {{math|''L''}} be [[Extended real number line|extended real numbers]] (i.e., real numbers, positive infinity, or negative infinity). Let {{math|''I''}} be an [[open interval]] containing {{math|''c''}} (for a two-sided limit) or an open interval with endpoint {{math|''c''}} (for a [[one-sided limit]], or a [[limit at infinity]] if {{math|''c''}} is infinite). The real valued functions {{math|''f''}} and {{math|''g''}} are assumed to be [[Differentiable function|differentiable]] on {{math|''I''}} except possibly at {{math|''c''}}, and additionally <math>g'(x)\\ne 0</math> on {{math|''I''}} except possibly at {{math|''c''}}. It is also assumed that <math>\\lim_{x\\to c}\\frac{f'(x)}{g'(x)} = L.</math> Thus the rule applies to situations in which the ratio of the derivatives has a finite or infinite limit, but not to situations in which that ratio fluctuates permanently as {{math|''x''}} gets closer and closer to {{math|''c''}}.\n\nIf either\n:<math>\\lim_{x\\to c}f(x) = \\lim_{x\\to c}g(x) = 0</math>\nor\n:<math>\\lim_{x\\to c}|f(x)| = \\lim_{x\\to c}|g(x)| = \\infty,</math>\nthen\n:<math>\\lim_{x\\to c}\\frac{f(x)}{g(x)}=L.</math>\nAlthough we have written ''x''&nbsp;&rarr; ''c'' throughout, the limits may also be one-sided limits (''x''&nbsp;&rarr; ''c''<sup>+</sup> or ''x''&nbsp;&rarr; ''c''<sup>&minus;</sup>), when {{math|''c''}} is a finite endpoint of {{math|''I''}}.\n\nIn the second case, the hypothesis that {{math|''f''}} [[Divergent series|diverges]] to infinity is not used in the proof (see note at the end of the proof section); thus, while the conditions of the rule are normally stated as above, the second sufficient condition for the rule's procedure to be valid can be more briefly stated as <math>\\lim_{x\\to c}|g(x)| = \\infty.</math>\n\nThe hypothesis that <math>g'(x)\\ne 0</math> appears most commonly in the literature, but some authors sidestep this hypothesis by adding other hypotheses elsewhere. One method<ref>{{harv|Chatterjee|2005|loc=p. 291}}</ref> is to define the limit of a function with the additional requirement that the limiting function is defined everywhere on the relevant interval {{math|''I''}} except possibly at {{math|''c''}}.{{efn|The functional analysis definition of the limit of a function does not require the existence of such an interval.}} Another method<ref>{{harv|Krantz|2004|loc=p.79}}</ref> is to require that both {{math|''f''}} and {{math|''g''}} be differentiable everywhere on an interval containing {{math|''c''}}.\n\n== Requirement that the limit exist ==\nThe requirement that the limit\n\n:<math>\\lim_{x\\to c}\\frac{f'(x)}{g'(x)}</math>\n\nexists is essential. Without this condition, <math>f'</math> or <math>g'</math> may exhibit undamped oscillations as <math>x</math> approaches <math>c</math>, in which case L'H\u00f4pital's rule does not apply. For example, if <math>f(x)=x+\\sin(x)</math>, <math>g(x)=x</math> and <math>c=\\pm\\infty</math>, then\n\n:<math>\\frac{f'(x)}{g'(x)}=\\frac{1+\\cos(x)}{1};</math>\n\nthis expression does not approach a limit as <math>x</math> goes to <math>c</math>, since the cosine function oscillates between {{math|1}} and {{math|\u22121}}. But working with the original functions, <math>\\lim_{x\\to\\infty}\\frac{f(x)}{g(x)}</math> can be shown to exist:\n\n:<math>\\lim_{x\\to\\infty}\\frac{f(x)}{g(x)} = \\lim_{x\\to\\infty}\\left(1+\\frac{\\sin(x)}{x}\\right) = 1. </math>\n\nIn a case such as this, all that can be concluded is that\n\n: <math> \\liminf_{x \\to c} \\frac{f'(x)}{g'(x)} \\leq \\liminf_{x \\to c} \\frac{f(x)}{g(x)} \\leq \\limsup_{x \\to c} \\frac{f(x)}{g(x)} \\leq \\limsup_{x \\to c} \\frac{f'(x)}{g'(x)} ,</math>\n\nso that if the limit of ''f''/''g'' exists, then it must lie between the inferior and superior limits of ''f''&prime;/''g''&prime;.  (In the example above, this is true, since 1 indeed lies between 0 and 2.)\n\n==Examples==\n* Here is a basic example involving the exponential function, which involves the indeterminate form {{sfrac|0|0}} at {{math|''x'' {{=}} 0}}:\n\n::<math>\n\\begin{align}\n  \\lim_{x\\to 0} \\frac{e^x - 1}{x^2+x} &= \\lim_{x\\to 0} \\frac{\\frac{d}{dx}(e^x - 1)}{\\frac{d}{dx}(x^2+x)} \\\\[4pt]\n  &= \\lim_{x\\to 0} \\frac{e^x}{2x+1} \\\\[4pt]\n  &= 1.\n\\end{align}\n</math>\n\n* This is a more elaborate example involving {{sfrac|0|0}}. Applying L'H\u00f4pital's rule a single time still results in an indeterminate form. In this case, the limit may be evaluated by applying the rule three times:\n\n::<math>\n\\begin{align}\n\\lim_{x\\to 0}{\\frac{2\\sin(x)-\\sin(2x)}{x-\\sin(x)}}\n& =\\lim_{x\\to 0}{\\frac{2\\cos(x)-2\\cos(2x)}{1-\\cos(x)}} \\\\[4pt]\n& = \\lim_{x\\to 0}{\\frac{-2\\sin(x)+4\\sin(2x)}{\\sin(x)}} \\\\[4pt]\n& = \\lim_{x\\to 0}{\\frac{-2\\cos(x)+8\\cos(2x)}{\\cos(x)}} \\\\[4pt]\n& ={\\frac{-2+8}{1}} \\\\[4pt]\n& =6.\n\\end{align}\n</math>\n\n* Here is an example involving {{sfrac|\u221e|\u221e}}:\n\n::<math>\\lim_{x\\to\\infty}x^n\\cdot e^{-x}\n=\\lim_{x\\to\\infty}{\\frac{x^n}{e^x}}\n=\\lim_{x\\to\\infty}{\\frac{nx^{n-1}}{e^x}}\n=n\\cdot \\lim_{x\\to\\infty}{\\frac{x^{n-1}}{e^x}}.</math>\n\n:Repeatedly apply L'H\u00f4pital's rule until the exponent is zero (if {{mvar|n}} is an integer) or negative (if {{mvar|n}} is fractional) to conclude that the limit is zero.\n\n* Here is an example involving the indeterminate form {{math|0 \u00b7 \u221e}} (see below), which is rewritten as the form {{sfrac|\u221e|\u221e}}:\n\n::<math>\\lim_{x\\to 0^+}x \\ln x =\\lim_{x\\to 0^+} \\frac{\\ln x}{\\frac{1}{x}}\n  = \\lim_{x\\to 0^+} \\frac{\\frac{1}{x}}{-\\frac{1}{x^2}}\n  = \\lim_{x\\to 0^+} -x = 0.</math>\n\n*Here is an example involving the [[Mortgage calculator#Monthly payment formula|mortgage repayment formula]] and {{sfrac|0|0}}. Let {{math|''P''}} be the principal (loan amount), {{math|''r''}} the interest rate per period and {{math|''n''}} the number of periods.  When {{math|''r''}} is zero, the repayment amount per period is <math>\\frac{P}{n}</math> (since only principal is being repaid); this is consistent with the formula for non-zero interest rates:\n\n::<math>\\begin{align}\n    \\lim_{r\\to 0}\\frac{Pr(1+r)^n}{(1+r)^n-1}\n    & = P \\lim_{r\\to 0} \\frac{(1+r)^n+rn(1+r)^{n-1}}{n(1+r)^{n-1}} \\\\[4pt]\n    & = \\frac{P}{n}.\n  \\end{align}</math>\n\n* One can also use L'H\u00f4pital's rule to prove the following theorem. If {{math|''f''}} is twice-differentiable in a neighborhood of {{math|''x''}}, then\n\n::<math>\\begin{align}\n    \\lim_{h\\to 0}\\frac{f(x+h)+f(x-h)-2f(x)}{h^2}\n    &= \\lim_{h\\to 0}\\frac{f'(x+h)-f'(x-h)}{2h} \\\\[4pt]\n    &= \\lim_{h\\to 0}\\frac{f''(x+h) + f''(x-h)}{2} \\\\[4pt]\n    &= f''(x).\n  \\end{align}</math>\n\n*Sometimes L'H\u00f4pital's rule is invoked in a tricky way: suppose {{math|''f''(''x'') + ''f''\u2032(''x'')}} converges as {{math|''x'' \u2192 \u221e}} and that <math>e^x\\cdot f(x)</math> converges to positive or negative infinity. Then:\n::<math>\\lim_{x\\to\\infty}f(x) = \\lim_{x\\to\\infty}\\frac{e^x\\cdot f(x)}{e^x} = \\lim_{x\\to\\infty}\\frac{e^x\\bigl(f(x)+f'(x)\\bigr)}{e^x} = \\lim_{x\\to\\infty}\\bigl(f(x)+f'(x)\\bigr)</math>\n:and so, &nbsp;<math>\\lim_{x\\to\\infty}f(x)</math>&nbsp; exists and &nbsp;<math>\\lim_{x\\to\\infty}f'(x) = 0.</math>\n:The result remains true without the added hypothesis that <math>e^x\\cdot f(x)</math> converges to positive or negative infinity, but the justification is then incomplete.\n\n== Complications ==\nSometimes L'H\u00f4pital's rule does not lead to an answer in a finite number of steps unless some additional steps are applied. Examples include the following:\n\n* Two applications can lead to a return to the original expression that was to be evaluated:\n\n::<math>\\lim_{x\\to\\infty}\\frac{e^x+e^{-x}}{e^x-e^{-x}} = \\lim_{x\\to\\infty}\\frac{e^x-e^{-x}}{e^x+e^{-x}} = \\lim_{x\\to\\infty}\\frac{e^x+e^{-x}}{e^x-e^{-x}} = \\cdots .</math>\n\n:This situation can be dealt with by substituting <math>y=e^x</math> and noting that {{math|''y''}} goes to infinity as {{math|''x''}} goes to infinity; with this substitution, this problem can be solved with a single application of the rule:\n\n::<math>\\lim_{x\\to\\infty}\\frac{e^x+e^{-x}}{e^x-e^{-x}} = \\lim_{y\\to\\infty}\\frac{y+y^{-1}}{y-y^{-1}} = \\lim_{y\\to\\infty}\\frac{1-y^{-2}}{1+y^{-2}} = \\frac{1}{1} = 1.</math>\n\n:Alternatively, the numerator and denominator can both be multiplied by <math>e^x,</math> at which point L'H\u00f4pital's rule can immediately be applied successfully:<ref>Multiplying by <math>e^-x</math> instead yields a solution to the limit without need for l'H\u00f4pital's rule.</ref>\n\n::<math>\\lim_{x\\to\\infty}\\frac{e^x+e^{-x}}{e^x-e^{-x}} = \\lim_{x\\to\\infty}\\frac{e^{2x} + 1}{e^{2x} - 1} = \\lim_{x\\to\\infty}\\frac{2e^{2x}}{2e^{2x}} = 1.</math>\n\n*An arbitrarily large number of applications may never lead to an answer even without repeating:\n\n::<math>\\lim_{x\\to\\infty}\\frac{x^\\frac1{2}+x^{-\\frac1{2}}}{x^\\frac1{2}-x^{-\\frac1{2}}} = \\lim_{x\\to\\infty}\\frac{\\frac1{2}x^{-\\frac1{2}}-\\frac{1}{2}x^{-\\frac3{2}}}{\\frac1{2}x^{-\\frac1{2}}+\\frac1{2}x^{-\\frac3{2}}} = \\lim_{x\\to\\infty}\\frac{-\\frac1{4}x^{-\\frac3{2}}+\\frac3{4}x^{-\\frac5{2}}}{-\\frac1{4}x^{-\\frac3{2}}-\\frac3{4}x^{-\\frac5{2}}} = \\cdots .</math>\n\n:This situation too can be dealt with by a transformation of variables, in this case <math>y = \\sqrt{x}</math>:\n\n::<math>\\lim_{x\\to\\infty}\\frac{x^\\frac1{2}+x^{-\\frac1{2}}}{x^\\frac1{2}-x^{-\\frac1{2}}} = \\lim_{y\\to\\infty}\\frac{y+y^{-1}}{y-y^{-1}} = \\lim_{y\\to\\infty} \\frac{1-y^{-2}}{1+y^{-2}} = \\frac1{1} = 1.</math>\n\n:Again, an alternative approach is to multiply numerator and denominator by <math>x^{1/2}</math> before applying L'H\u00f4pital's rule:\n\n::<math>\\lim_{x\\to\\infty}\\frac{x^\\frac{1}{2}+x^{-\\frac{1}{2}}}{x^\\frac{1}{2}-x^{-\\frac{1}{2}}} = \\lim_{x\\to\\infty}\\frac{x+1}{x-1} = \\lim_{x\\to\\infty}\\frac{1}{1} = 1.</math>\n\nA common pitfall is using L'H\u00f4pital's rule with some [[circular reasoning]] to compute a derivative via a [[Derivative#Definition via difference quotients|difference quotient]]. For example, consider the task of proving the derivative formula for [[Derivative#Computing the derivative|powers of ''x'']]:\n\n:<math>\\lim_{h\\to 0}\\frac{(x+h)^n-x^n}{h}=nx^{n-1}.</math>\n\nApplying L'H\u00f4pital's rule and finding the derivatives with respect to {{math|''h''}} of the numerator and the denominator yields \n{{math|''n x''<sup>''n''\u22121</sup>}} as expected. However, differentiating the numerator required the use of the very fact that is being proven.  This is an example of [[begging the question]], since one may not assume the fact to be proven during the course of the proof.\n\n== Counterexamples when the derivative of the denominator is zero ==\nThe necessity of the condition that <math>g'(x)\\ne 0</math> near <math>c</math> can be seen by the following counterexample due to [[Otto Stolz]].<ref name=\"stolz\">{{Cite journal |last=Stolz |first=Otto |author-link=Otto Stolz |year=1879 |title=Ueber die Grenzwerthe der Quotienten |trans-title=About the limits of quotients |url=http://www.digizeitschriften.de/dms/img/?PID=GDZPPN002245159&physid=phys570 |journal=[[Mathematische Annalen]] |language=German |volume=15 |pages=556\u2013559 |doi=10.1007/bf02086277}}</ref> Let <math>f(x)=x+\\sin x \\cos x</math> and <math>g(x)=f(x)e^{\\sin x}.</math> Then there is no limit for <math>f(x)/g(x)</math> as <math>x\\to\\infty.</math> However,\n\n:<math>\\begin{align}\n   \\frac{f'(x)}{g'(x)} &= \\frac{2\\cos^2 x}{(2 \\cos^2 x) e^{\\sin x} + (x+\\sin x \\cos x) e^{\\sin x} \\cos x} \\\\[4pt]\n   &= \\frac{2\\cos x}{2 \\cos x +x+\\sin x \\cos x} e^{-\\sin x},\n \\end{align}</math>\n\nwhich tends to 0 as <math>x\\to\\infty</math>.

Suppose {{math|1=''f''(''c'') = ''g''(''c'') = 0}}. The limit of the ratio {{math|{{sfrac|''f''(''t'')|''g''(''t'')}}}} as {{math|''t'' \u2192 ''c''}} is the slope of the tangent to the curve at the point {{math|1=[''g''(''c''), ''f''(''c'')] = [0,0]}}. The tangent to the curve at the point {{math|[''g''(''t''), ''f''(''t'')]}} is given by {{math|[''g''\u2032(''t''), ''f''\u2032(''t'')]}}. L'H\u00f4pital's rule then states that the slope of the curve when {{math|1=''t'' = ''c''}} is the limit of the slope of the tangent to the curve as the curve approaches the origin, provided that this is defined.\n\n== Proof of L'H\u00f4pital's rule ==\n\n===Special case===\nThe proof of L'H\u00f4pital's rule is simple in the case where {{math|''f''}} and {{math|''g''}} are [[continuously differentiable]] at the point {{math|''c''}} and where a finite limit is found after the first round of differentiation. It is not a proof of the general L'H\u00f4pital's rule because it is stricter in its definition, requiring both differentiability and that ''c'' be a real number. Since many common functions have continuous derivatives (e.g. [[polynomial]]s, [[sine]] and [[cosine]], [[exponential function]]s), it is a special case worthy of attention.\n\nSuppose that {{math|''f''}} and {{math|''g''}} are continuously differentiable at a real number {{math|''c''}}, that <math>f(c)=g(c)=0</math>, and that <math>g'(c)\\neq 0</math>.

The last equality follows from the continuity of the derivatives at {{math|''c''}}. The limit in the conclusion is not indeterminate because <math>g'(c)\\ne 0</math>.\n\nThe proof of a more general version of L'H\u00f4pital's rule is given below.\n\n===General proof===\nThe following proof is due to {{harvtxt|Taylor|1952}}, where a unified proof for the {{sfrac|0|0}} and {{sfrac|\u00b1\u221e|\u00b1\u221e}} indeterminate forms is given. Taylor notes that different proofs may be found in {{harvtxt|Lettenmeyer|1936}} and {{harvtxt|Wazewski|1949}}.\n\nLet ''f'' and ''g'' be functions satisfying the hypotheses in the [[L'hopital's rule#General form|General form]] section. Let <math>\\mathcal{I}</math> be the open interval in the hypothesis with endpoint ''c''. Considering that <math>g'(x)\\ne 0</math> on this interval and ''g'' is continuous, <math>\\mathcal{I}</math> can be chosen smaller so that ''g'' is nonzero on <math>\\mathcal{I}</math>.{{efn|1=Since ''g' '' is nonzero and ''g'' is continuous on the interval, it is impossible for ''g'' to be zero more than once on the interval. If it had two zeros, the [[mean value theorem]] would assert the existence of a point ''p'' in the interval between the zeros such that ''g' ''(''p'')&nbsp;=&nbsp;0. So either ''g'' is already nonzero on the interval, or else the interval can be reduced in size so as not to contain the single zero of ''g''.}}\n\nFor each ''x'' in the interval, define <math>m(x)=\\inf\\frac{f'(\\xi)}{g'(\\xi)}</math> and <math>M(x)=\\sup\\frac{f'(\\xi)}{g'(\\xi)}</math> as <math>\\xi</math> ranges over all values between ''x'' and ''c''. (The symbols inf and sup denote the [[infimum]] and [[supremum]].)\n\nFrom the differentiability of ''f'' and ''g'' on <math>\\mathcal{I}</math>, [[Cauchy's mean value theorem]] ensures that for any two distinct points ''x'' and ''y'' in <math>\\mathcal{I}</math> there exists a <math>\\xi</math> between ''x'' and ''y'' such that <math>\\frac{f(x)-f(y)}{g(x)-g(y)}=\\frac{f'(\\xi)}{g'(\\xi)}</math>. Consequently, <math>m(x)\\leq \\frac{f(x)-f(y)}{g(x)-g(y)} \\leq M(x)</math> for all choices of distinct ''x'' and ''y'' in the interval. The value ''g''(''x'')-''g''(''y'') is always nonzero for distinct ''x'' and ''y'' in the interval, for if it was not, the [[mean value theorem]] would imply the existence of a ''p'' between ''x'' and ''y'' such that ''g' ''(''p'')=0.\n\nThe definition of ''m''(''x'') and ''M''(''x'') will result in an extended real number, and so it is possible for them to take on the values \u00b1\u221e.  In the following two cases, ''m''(''x'') and ''M''(''x'') will establish bounds on the ratio {{sfrac|''f''|''g''}}.\n\n'''Case 1:''' <math>\\lim_{x\\to c}f(x)=\\lim_{x\\to c}g(x)=0</math>\n\nFor any ''x'' in the interval <math>\\mathcal{I}</math>, and point ''y'' between ''x'' and ''c'',\n:<math>m(x)\\le \\frac{f(x)-f(y)}{g(x)-g(y)}=\\frac{\\frac{f(x)}{g(x)}-\\frac{f(y)}{g(x)}}{1-\\frac{g(y)}{g(x)}}\\le M(x)</math>\nand therefore as ''y'' approaches ''c'', <math>\\frac{f(y)}{g(x)}</math> and <math>\\frac{g(y)}{g(x)}</math> become zero, and so\n:<math>m(x)\\leq\\frac{f(x)}{g(x)}\\leq M(x).</math>\n\n'''Case 2:''' <math>\\lim_{x\\to c}|g(x)|=\\infty</math>\n\nFor every ''x'' in the interval <math>\\mathcal{I}</math>, define <math>S_x=\\{y\\mid y \\text{ is between } x \\text{ and } c\\}</math>.

In the case 2, and the squeeze theorem again asserts that <math>\\liminf_{x\\to c}\\frac{f(x)}{g(x)}=\\limsup_{x\\to c}\\frac{f(x)}{g(x)}=L</math>, and so the limit <math>\\lim_{x\\to c}\\frac{f(x)}{g(x)}</math> exists and is equal to ''L''. This is the result that was to be proven.\n\nIn case 2 the assumption that ''f''(''x'') diverges to infinity was not used within the proof. This means that if |''g''(''x'')| diverges to infinity as ''x'' approaches ''c'' and both ''f'' and ''g'' satisfy the hypotheses of L'H\u00f4pital's rule, then no additional assumption is needed about the limit of ''f''(''x''): It could even be the case that the limit of ''f''(''x'') does not exist. In this case, L'Hopital's theorem is actually a consequence of Ces\u00e0ro\u2013Stolz.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.imomath.com/index.php?options=686|website=IMOmath|publisher=[[International Mathematical Olympiad]]|title=L\u2019Hopital\u2019s Theorem}}</ref>\n\nIn the case when |''g''(''x'')| diverges to infinity as ''x'' approaches ''c'' and ''f''(''x'') converges to a finite limit at ''c'', then L'H\u00f4pital's rule would be applicable, but not absolutely necessary, since basic limit calculus will show that the limit of ''f''(''x'')/''g''(''x'') as ''x'' approaches ''c'' must be zero.\n\n== Corollary ==\nA simple but very useful consequence of L'Hopital's rule is a well-known criterion for differentiability. It states the following:\nsuppose that ''f'' is continuous at ''a'', and that <math>f'(x)</math> exists for all ''x'' in some open interval containing ''a'', except perhaps for <math>x = a</math>. Suppose, moreover, that <math>\\lim_{x\\to a}f'(x)</math> exists. Then <math>f'(a)</math> also exists and\n:<math>f'(a) = \\lim_{x\\to a}f'(x).</math>\nIn particular, ''f''' is also continuous at ''a''.\n\n===Proof===\nConsider the functions <math>h(x) = f(x)-f(a)</math> and  <math>g(x) = x-a</math>. The continuity of ''f'' at ''a'' tells us that <math>\\lim_{x\\to a}h(x) = 0</math>. Moreover, <math>\\lim_{x\\to a}g(x) = 0</math> since a polynomial function is always continuous everywhere. Applying L'Hopital's rule shows that <math>f'(a) := \\lim_{x\\to a}\\frac{f(x)-f(a)}{x-a} = \\lim_{x\\to a}\\frac{h(x)}{g(x)} = \\lim_{x\\to a}f'(x)</math>.<!-- ==Conversion==\nInformally L'H\u00f4pital's rule states that if derivatives of functions are comparable, then functions themselves are also comparable.

Application (or repeated application) of the rule often converts an indeterminate form to an expression that can be easily evaluated by substitution. The rule is named after the 17th-century [[France|French]] [[mathematician]] [[Guillaume de l'H\u00f4pital]].

Let {{math|''c''}} and {{math|''L''}} be [[Extended real number line|extended real numbers]] (i.e., real numbers, positive infinity, or negative infinity). Let {{math|''I''}} be an [[open interval]] containing {{math|''c''}} (for a two-sided limit) or an open interval with endpoint {{math|''c''}} (for a [[one-sided limit]], or a [[limit at infinity]] if {{math|''c''}} is infinite). The real valued functions {{math|''f''}} and {{math|''g''}} are assumed to be [[Differentiable function|differentiable]] on {{math|''I''}} except possibly at {{math|''c''}}, and additionally <math>g'(x)\\ne 0</math> on {{math|''I''}} except possibly at {{math|''c''}}. It is also assumed that <math>\\lim_{x\\to c}\\frac{f'(x)}{g'(x)} = L.</math> Thus the rule applies to situations in which the ratio of the derivatives has a finite or infinite limit, but not to situations in which that ratio fluctuates permanently as {{math|''x''}} gets closer and closer to {{math|''c''}}.\n\nIf either\n:<math>\\lim_{x\\to c}f(x) = \\lim_{x\\to c}g(x) = 0</math>\nor\n:<math>\\lim_{x\\to c}|f(x)| = \\lim_{x\\to c}|g(x)| = \\infty,</math>\nthen\n:<math>\\lim_{x\\to c}\\frac{f(x)}{g(x)}=L.</math>\nAlthough we have written ''x''&nbsp;&rarr; ''c'' throughout, the limits may also be one-sided limits (''x''&nbsp;&rarr; ''c''<sup>+</sup> or ''x''&nbsp;&rarr; ''c''<sup>&minus;</sup>), when {{math|''c''}} is a finite endpoint of {{math|''I''}}.\n\nIn the second case, the hypothesis that {{math|''f''}} [[Divergent series|diverges]] to infinity is not used in the proof (see note at the end of the proof section); thus, while the conditions of the rule are normally stated as above, the second sufficient condition for the rule's procedure to be valid can be more briefly stated as <math>\\lim_{x\\to c}|g(x)| = \\infty.</math>\n\nThe hypothesis that <math>g'(x)\\ne 0</math> appears most commonly in the literature, but some authors sidestep this hypothesis by adding other hypotheses elsewhere. One method<ref>{{harv|Chatterjee|2005|loc=p. 291}}</ref> is to define the limit of a function with the additional requirement that the limiting function is defined everywhere on the relevant interval {{math|''I''}} except possibly at {{math|''c''}}.{{efn|The functional analysis definition of the limit of a function does not require the existence of such an interval.}} Another method<ref>{{harv|Krantz|2004|loc=p.79}}</ref> is to require that both {{math|''f''}} and {{math|''g''}} be differentiable everywhere on an interval containing {{math|''c''}}.\n\n== Requirement that the limit exist ==\nThe requirement that the limit\n\n:<math>\\lim_{x\\to c}\\frac{f'(x)}{g'(x)}</math>\n\nexists is essential. Without this condition, <math>f'</math> or <math>g'</math> may exhibit undamped oscillations as <math>x</math> approaches <math>c</math>, in which case L'H\u00f4pital's rule does not apply. For example, if <math>f(x)=x+\\sin(x)</math>, <math>g(x)=x</math> and <math>c=\\pm\\infty</math>, then\n\n:<math>\\frac{f'(x)}{g'(x)}=\\frac{1+\\cos(x)}{1};</math>\n\nthis expression does not approach a limit as <math>x</math> goes to <math>c</math>, since the cosine function oscillates between {{math|1}} and {{math|\u22121}}. But working with the original functions, <math>\\lim_{x\\to\\infty}\\frac{f(x)}{g(x)}</math> can be shown to exist:\n\n:<math>\\lim_{x\\to\\infty}\\frac{f(x)}{g(x)} = \\lim_{x\\to\\infty}\\left(1+\\frac{\\sin(x)}{x}\\right) = 1. </math>\n\nIn a case such as this, all that can be concluded is that\n\n: <math> \\liminf_{x \\to c} \\frac{f'(x)}{g'(x)} \\leq \\liminf_{x \\to c} \\frac{f(x)}{g(x)} \\leq \\limsup_{x \\to c} \\frac{f(x)}{g(x)} \\leq \\limsup_{x \\to c} \\frac{f'(x)}{g'(x)} ,</math>\n\nso that if the limit of ''f''/''g'' exists, then it must lie between the inferior and superior limits of ''f''&prime;/''g''&prime;.  (In the example above, this is true, since 1 indeed lies between 0 and 2.)\n\n==Examples==\n* Here is a basic example involving the exponential function, which involves the indeterminate form {{sfrac|0|0}} at {{math|''x'' {{=}} 0}}:\n\n::<math>\n\\begin{align}\n  \\lim_{x\\to 0} \\frac{e^x - 1}{x^2+x} &= \\lim_{x\\to 0} \\frac{\\frac{d}{dx}(e^x - 1)}{\\frac{d}{dx}(x^2+x)} \\\\[4pt]\n  &= \\lim_{x\\to 0} \\frac{e^x}{2x+1} \\\\[4pt]\n  &= 1.\n\\end{align}\n</math>\n\n* This is a more elaborate example involving {{sfrac|0|0}}. Applying L'H\u00f4pital's rule a single time still results in an indeterminate form. In this case, the limit may be evaluated by applying the rule three times:\n\n::<math>\n\\begin{align}\n\\lim_{x\\to 0}{\\frac{2\\sin(x)-\\sin(2x)}{x-\\sin(x)}}\n& =\\lim_{x\\to 0}{\\frac{2\\cos(x)-2\\cos(2x)}{1-\\cos(x)}} \\\\[4pt]\n& = \\lim_{x\\to 0}{\\frac{-2\\sin(x)+4\\sin(2x)}{\\sin(x)}} \\\\[4pt]\n& = \\lim_{x\\to 0}{\\frac{-2\\cos(x)+8\\cos(2x)}{\\cos(x)}} \\\\[4pt]\n& ={\\frac{-2+8}{1}} \\\\[4pt]\n& =6.\n\\end{align}\n</math>\n\n* Here is an example involving {{sfrac|\u221e|\u221e}}:\n\n::<math>\\lim_{x\\to\\infty}x^n\\cdot e^{-x}\n=\\lim_{x\\to\\infty}{\\frac{x^n}{e^x}}\n=\\lim_{x\\to\\infty}{\\frac{nx^{n-1}}{e^x}}\n=n\\cdot \\lim_{x\\to\\infty}{\\frac{x^{n-1}}{e^x}}.</math>\n\n:Repeatedly apply L'H\u00f4pital's rule until the exponent is zero (if {{mvar|n}} is an integer) or negative (if {{mvar|n}} is fractional) to conclude that the limit is zero.\n\n* Here is an example involving the indeterminate form {{math|0 \u00b7 \u221e}} (see below), which is rewritten as the form {{sfrac|\u221e|\u221e}}:\n\n::<math>\\lim_{x\\to 0^+}x \\ln x =\\lim_{x\\to 0^+} \\frac{\\ln x}{\\frac{1}{x}}\n  = \\lim_{x\\to 0^+} \\frac{\\frac{1}{x}}{-\\frac{1}{x^2}}\n  = \\lim_{x\\to 0^+} -x = 0.</math>\n\n*Here is an example involving the [[Mortgage calculator#Monthly payment formula|mortgage repayment formula]] and {{sfrac|0|0}}. Let {{math|''P''}} be the principal (loan amount), {{math|''r''}} the interest rate per period and {{math|''n''}} the number of periods.  When {{math|''r''}} is zero, the repayment amount per period is <math>\\frac{P}{n}</math> (since only principal is being repaid); this is consistent with the formula for non-zero interest rates:\n\n::<math>\\begin{align}\n    \\lim_{r\\to 0}\\frac{Pr(1+r)^n}{(1+r)^n-1}\n    & = P \\lim_{r\\to 0} \\frac{(1+r)^n+rn(1+r)^{n-1}}{n(1+r)^{n-1}} \\\\[4pt]\n    & = \\frac{P}{n}.\n  \\end{align}</math>\n\n* One can also use L'H\u00f4pital's rule to prove the following theorem.

Then:\n::<math>\\lim_{x\\to\\infty}f(x) = \\lim_{x\\to\\infty}\\frac{e^x\\cdot f(x)}{e^x} = \\lim_{x\\to\\infty}\\frac{e^x\\bigl(f(x)+f'(x)\\bigr)}{e^x} = \\lim_{x\\to\\infty}\\bigl(f(x)+f'(x)\\bigr)</math>\n:and so, &nbsp;<math>\\lim_{x\\to\\infty}f(x)</math>&nbsp; exists and &nbsp;<math>\\lim_{x\\to\\infty}f'(x) = 0.</math>\n:The result remains true without the added hypothesis that <math>e^x\\cdot f(x)</math> converges to positive or negative infinity, but the justification is then incomplete.\n\n== Complications ==\nSometimes L'H\u00f4pital's rule does not lead to an answer in a finite number of steps unless some additional steps are applied. Examples include the following:\n\n* Two applications can lead to a return to the original expression that was to be evaluated:\n\n::<math>\\lim_{x\\to\\infty}\\frac{e^x+e^{-x}}{e^x-e^{-x}} = \\lim_{x\\to\\infty}\\frac{e^x-e^{-x}}{e^x+e^{-x}} = \\lim_{x\\to\\infty}\\frac{e^x+e^{-x}}{e^x-e^{-x}} = \\cdots .</math>\n\n:This situation can be dealt with by substituting <math>y=e^x</math> and noting that {{math|''y''}} goes to infinity as {{math|''x''}} goes to infinity; with this substitution, this problem can be solved with a single application of the rule:\n\n::<math>\\lim_{x\\to\\infty}\\frac{e^x+e^{-x}}{e^x-e^{-x}} = \\lim_{y\\to\\infty}\\frac{y+y^{-1}}{y-y^{-1}} = \\lim_{y\\to\\infty}\\frac{1-y^{-2}}{1+y^{-2}} = \\frac{1}{1} = 1.</math>\n\n:Alternatively, the numerator and denominator can both be multiplied by <math>e^x,</math> at which point L'H\u00f4pital's rule can immediately be applied successfully:<ref>Multiplying by <math>e^-x</math> instead yields a solution to the limit without need for l'H\u00f4pital's rule.</ref>\n\n::<math>\\lim_{x\\to\\infty}\\frac{e^x+e^{-x}}{e^x-e^{-x}} = \\lim_{x\\to\\infty}\\frac{e^{2x} + 1}{e^{2x} - 1} = \\lim_{x\\to\\infty}\\frac{2e^{2x}}{2e^{2x}} = 1.</math>\n\n*An arbitrarily large number of applications may never lead to an answer even without repeating:\n\n::<math>\\lim_{x\\to\\infty}\\frac{x^\\frac1{2}+x^{-\\frac1{2}}}{x^\\frac1{2}-x^{-\\frac1{2}}} = \\lim_{x\\to\\infty}\\frac{\\frac1{2}x^{-\\frac1{2}}-\\frac{1}{2}x^{-\\frac3{2}}}{\\frac1{2}x^{-\\frac1{2}}+\\frac1{2}x^{-\\frac3{2}}} = \\lim_{x\\to\\infty}\\frac{-\\frac1{4}x^{-\\frac3{2}}+\\frac3{4}x^{-\\frac5{2}}}{-\\frac1{4}x^{-\\frac3{2}}-\\frac3{4}x^{-\\frac5{2}}} = \\cdots .</math>\n\n:This situation too can be dealt with by a transformation of variables, in this case <math>y = \\sqrt{x}</math>:\n\n::<math>\\lim_{x\\to\\infty}\\frac{x^\\frac1{2}+x^{-\\frac1{2}}}{x^\\frac1{2}-x^{-\\frac1{2}}} = \\lim_{y\\to\\infty}\\frac{y+y^{-1}}{y-y^{-1}} = \\lim_{y\\to\\infty} \\frac{1-y^{-2}}{1+y^{-2}} = \\frac1{1} = 1.</math>\n\n:Again, an alternative approach is to multiply numerator and denominator by <math>x^{1/2}</math> before applying L'H\u00f4pital's rule:\n\n::<math>\\lim_{x\\to\\infty}\\frac{x^\\frac{1}{2}+x^{-\\frac{1}{2}}}{x^\\frac{1}{2}-x^{-\\frac{1}{2}}} = \\lim_{x\\to\\infty}\\frac{x+1}{x-1} = \\lim_{x\\to\\infty}\\frac{1}{1} = 1.</math>\n\nA common pitfall is using L'H\u00f4pital's rule with some [[circular reasoning]] to compute a derivative via a [[Derivative#Definition via difference quotients|difference quotient]]. For example, consider the task of proving the derivative formula for [[Derivative#Computing the derivative|powers of ''x'']]:\n\n:<math>\\lim_{h\\to 0}\\frac{(x+h)^n-x^n}{h}=nx^{n-1}.</math>\n\nApplying L'H\u00f4pital's rule and finding the derivatives with respect to {{math|''h''}} of the numerator and the denominator yields \n{{math|''n x''<sup>''n''\u22121</sup>}} as expected. However, differentiating the numerator required the use of the very fact that is being proven.  This is an example of [[begging the question]], since one may not assume the fact to be proven during the course of the proof.\n\n== Counterexamples when the derivative of the denominator is zero ==\nThe necessity of the condition that <math>g'(x)\\ne 0</math> near <math>c</math> can be seen by the following counterexample due to [[Otto Stolz]].<ref name=\"stolz\">{{Cite journal |last=Stolz |first=Otto |author-link=Otto Stolz |year=1879 |title=Ueber die Grenzwerthe der Quotienten |trans-title=About the limits of quotients |url=http://www.digizeitschriften.de/dms/img/?PID=GDZPPN002245159&physid=phys570 |journal=[[Mathematische Annalen]] |language=German |volume=15 |pages=556\u2013559 |doi=10.1007/bf02086277}}</ref> Let <math>f(x)=x+\\sin x \\cos x</math> and <math>g(x)=f(x)e^{\\sin x}.</math> Then there is no limit for <math>f(x)/g(x)</math> as <math>x\\to\\infty.</math> However,\n\n:<math>\\begin{align}\n   \\frac{f'(x)}{g'(x)} &= \\frac{2\\cos^2 x}{(2 \\cos^2 x) e^{\\sin x} + (x+\\sin x \\cos x) e^{\\sin x} \\cos x} \\\\[4pt]\n   &= \\frac{2\\cos x}{2 \\cos x +x+\\sin x \\cos x} e^{-\\sin x},\n \\end{align}</math>\n\nwhich tends to 0 as <math>x\\to\\infty</math>.

For example, to evaluate a limit involving {{math|\u221e \u2212 \u221e}}, convert the difference of two functions to a quotient:\n\n:<math>\n\\begin{align}\n\\lim_{x\\to 1}\\left(\\frac{x}{x-1}-\\frac1{\\ln x}\\right)\n& = \\lim_{x\\to 1}\\frac{x\\cdot\\ln x -x+1}{(x-1)\\cdot\\ln x} & \\quad (1) \\\\[6pt]\n& = \\lim_{x\\to 1}\\frac{\\ln x}{\\frac{x-1}{x}+\\ln x} & \\quad (2) \\\\[6pt]\n& = \\lim_{x\\to 1}\\frac{x\\cdot\\ln x}{x-1+x\\cdot\\ln x}     & \\quad (3) \\\\[6pt]\n& = \\lim_{x\\to 1}\\frac{1+\\ln x}{1+1+\\ln x}     & \\quad (4) \\\\[6pt]\n& = \\lim_{x\\to 1}\\frac{1+\\ln x}{2+\\ln x} \\\\[6pt]\n& = \\frac{1}{2},\n\\end{align}\n</math>\n\nwhere L'H\u00f4pital's rule is applied when going from (1) to (2) and again when going from (3) to (4).\n\nL'H\u00f4pital's rule can be used on indeterminate forms involving [[Exponentiation|exponents]] by using [[logarithm]]s to \"move the exponent down\". Here is an example involving the indeterminate form {{math|0<sup>0</sup>}}:\n\n:<math>\n\\lim_{x\\to 0^+}x^x\n= \\lim_{x\\to 0^+}e^{\\ln (x^x)}\n= \\lim_{x\\to 0^+}e^{x\\cdot\\ln x}\n= e^{\\lim\\limits_{x\\to 0^+}(x\\cdot\\ln x)}.\n</math>\n\nIt is valid to move the limit inside the [[exponential function]] because the exponential function is [[continuous function|continuous]].

Suppose {{math|1=''f''(''c'') = ''g''(''c'') = 0}}. The limit of the ratio {{math|{{sfrac|''f''(''t'')|''g''(''t'')}}}} as {{math|''t'' \u2192 ''c''}} is the slope of the tangent to the curve at the point {{math|1=[''g''(''c''), ''f''(''c'')] = [0,0]}}. The tangent to the curve at the point {{math|[''g''(''t''), ''f''(''t'')]}} is given by {{math|[''g''\u2032(''t''), ''f''\u2032(''t'')]}}. L'H\u00f4pital's rule then states that the slope of the curve when {{math|1=''t'' = ''c''}} is the limit of the slope of the tangent to the curve as the curve approaches the origin, provided that this is defined.\n\n== Proof of L'H\u00f4pital's rule ==\n\n===Special case===\nThe proof of L'H\u00f4pital's rule is simple in the case where {{math|''f''}} and {{math|''g''}} are [[continuously differentiable]] at the point {{math|''c''}} and where a finite limit is found after the first round of differentiation. It is not a proof of the general L'H\u00f4pital's rule because it is stricter in its definition, requiring both differentiability and that ''c'' be a real number. Since many common functions have continuous derivatives (e.g. [[polynomial]]s, [[sine]] and [[cosine]], [[exponential function]]s), it is a special case worthy of attention.\n\nSuppose that {{math|''f''}} and {{math|''g''}} are continuously differentiable at a real number {{math|''c''}}, that <math>f(c)=g(c)=0</math>, and that <math>g'(c)\\neq 0</math>. Then\n\n: <math>\n\\begin{align}\n& \\lim_{x\\to c}\\frac{f(x)}{g(x)} = \\lim_{x\\to c}\\frac{f(x)-0}{g(x)-0} = \\lim_{x\\to c}\\frac{f(x)-f(c)}{g(x)-g(c)} \\\\[6pt]\n= {} & \\lim_{x\\to c}\\frac{\\left(\\frac{f(x)-f(c)}{x-c}\\right)}{\\left(\\frac{g(x)-g(c)}{x-c} \\right)} = \\frac{\\lim\\limits_{x\\to c}\\left(\\frac{f(x)-f(c)}{x-c}\\right)}{\\lim\\limits_{x\\to c} \\left(\\frac{g(x)-g(c)}{x-c}\\right)}= \\frac{f'(c)}{g'(c)} = \\lim_{x\\to c}\\frac{f'(x)}{g'(x)}.\n\\end{align}\n</math>\n\nThis follows from the difference-quotient definition of the derivative. The last equality follows from the continuity of the derivatives at {{math|''c''}}. The limit in the conclusion is not indeterminate because <math>g'(c)\\ne 0</math>.\n\nThe proof of a more general version of L'H\u00f4pital's rule is given below.\n\n===General proof===\nThe following proof is due to {{harvtxt|Taylor|1952}}, where a unified proof for the {{sfrac|0|0}} and {{sfrac|\u00b1\u221e|\u00b1\u221e}} indeterminate forms is given. Taylor notes that different proofs may be found in {{harvtxt|Lettenmeyer|1936}} and {{harvtxt|Wazewski|1949}}.\n\nLet ''f'' and ''g'' be functions satisfying the hypotheses in the [[L'hopital's rule#General form|General form]] section. Let <math>\\mathcal{I}</math> be the open interval in the hypothesis with endpoint ''c''. Considering that <math>g'(x)\\ne 0</math> on this interval and ''g'' is continuous, <math>\\mathcal{I}</math> can be chosen smaller so that ''g'' is nonzero on <math>\\mathcal{I}</math>.{{efn|1=Since ''g' '' is nonzero and ''g'' is continuous on the interval, it is impossible for ''g'' to be zero more than once on the interval. If it had two zeros, the [[mean value theorem]] would assert the existence of a point ''p'' in the interval between the zeros such that ''g' ''(''p'')&nbsp;=&nbsp;0. So either ''g'' is already nonzero on the interval, or else the interval can be reduced in size so as not to contain the single zero of ''g''.}}\n\nFor each ''x'' in the interval, define <math>m(x)=\\inf\\frac{f'(\\xi)}{g'(\\xi)}</math> and <math>M(x)=\\sup\\frac{f'(\\xi)}{g'(\\xi)}</math> as <math>\\xi</math> ranges over all values between ''x'' and ''c''. (The symbols inf and sup denote the [[infimum]] and [[supremum]].)\n\nFrom the differentiability of ''f'' and ''g'' on <math>\\mathcal{I}</math>, [[Cauchy's mean value theorem]] ensures that for any two distinct points ''x'' and ''y'' in <math>\\mathcal{I}</math> there exists a <math>\\xi</math> between ''x'' and ''y'' such that <math>\\frac{f(x)-f(y)}{g(x)-g(y)}=\\frac{f'(\\xi)}{g'(\\xi)}</math>. Consequently, <math>m(x)\\leq \\frac{f(x)-f(y)}{g(x)-g(y)} \\leq M(x)</math> for all choices of distinct ''x'' and ''y'' in the interval. The value ''g''(''x'')-''g''(''y'') is always nonzero for distinct ''x'' and ''y'' in the interval, for if it was not, the [[mean value theorem]] would imply the existence of a ''p'' between ''x'' and ''y'' such that ''g' ''(''p'')=0.\n\nThe definition of ''m''(''x'') and ''M''(''x'') will result in an extended real number, and so it is possible for them to take on the values \u00b1\u221e.  In the following two cases, ''m''(''x'') and ''M''(''x'') will establish bounds on the ratio {{sfrac|''f''|''g''}}.\n\n'''Case 1:''' <math>\\lim_{x\\to c}f(x)=\\lim_{x\\to c}g(x)=0</math>\n\nFor any ''x'' in the interval <math>\\mathcal{I}</math>, and point ''y'' between ''x'' and ''c'',\n:<math>m(x)\\le \\frac{f(x)-f(y)}{g(x)-g(y)}=\\frac{\\frac{f(x)}{g(x)}-\\frac{f(y)}{g(x)}}{1-\\frac{g(y)}{g(x)}}\\le M(x)</math>\nand therefore as ''y'' approaches ''c'', <math>\\frac{f(y)}{g(x)}</math> and <math>\\frac{g(y)}{g(x)}</math> become zero, and so\n:<math>m(x)\\leq\\frac{f(x)}{g(x)}\\leq M(x).</math>\n\n'''Case 2:''' <math>\\lim_{x\\to c}|g(x)|=\\infty</math>\n\nFor every ''x'' in the interval <math>\\mathcal{I}</math>, define <math>S_x=\\{y\\mid y \\text{ is between } x \\text{ and } c\\}</math>.

In the case 2, and the squeeze theorem again asserts that <math>\\liminf_{x\\to c}\\frac{f(x)}{g(x)}=\\limsup_{x\\to c}\\frac{f(x)}{g(x)}=L</math>, and so the limit <math>\\lim_{x\\to c}\\frac{f(x)}{g(x)}</math> exists and is equal to ''L''. This is the result that was to be proven.\n\nIn case 2 the assumption that ''f''(''x'') diverges to infinity was not used within the proof. This means that if |''g''(''x'')| diverges to infinity as ''x'' approaches ''c'' and both ''f'' and ''g'' satisfy the hypotheses of L'H\u00f4pital's rule, then no additional assumption is needed about the limit of ''f''(''x''): It could even be the case that the limit of ''f''(''x'') does not exist. In this case, L'Hopital's theorem is actually a consequence of Ces\u00e0ro\u2013Stolz.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.imomath.com/index.php?options=686|website=IMOmath|publisher=[[International Mathematical Olympiad]]|title=L\u2019Hopital\u2019s Theorem}}</ref>\n\nIn the case when |''g''(''x'')| diverges to infinity as ''x'' approaches ''c'' and ''f''(''x'') converges to a finite limit at ''c'', then L'H\u00f4pital's rule would be applicable, but not absolutely necessary, since basic limit calculus will show that the limit of ''f''(''x'')/''g''(''x'') as ''x'' approaches ''c'' must be zero.\n\n== Corollary ==\nA simple but very useful consequence of L'Hopital's rule is a well-known criterion for differentiability. It states the following:\nsuppose that ''f'' is continuous at ''a'', and that <math>f'(x)</math> exists for all ''x'' in some open interval containing ''a'', except perhaps for <math>x = a</math>. Suppose, moreover, that <math>\\lim_{x\\to a}f'(x)</math> exists. Then <math>f'(a)</math> also exists and\n:<math>f'(a) = \\lim_{x\\to a}f'(x).</math>\nIn particular, ''f''' is also continuous at ''a''.\n\n===Proof===\nConsider the functions <math>h(x) = f(x)-f(a)</math> and  <math>g(x) = x-a</math>. The continuity of ''f'' at ''a'' tells us that <math>\\lim_{x\\to a}h(x) = 0</math>. Moreover, <math>\\lim_{x\\to a}g(x) = 0</math> since a polynomial function is always continuous everywhere. Applying L'Hopital's rule shows that <math>f'(a) := \\lim_{x\\to a}\\frac{f(x)-f(a)}{x-a} = \\lim_{x\\to a}\\frac{h(x)}{g(x)} = \\lim_{x\\to a}f'(x)</math>.<!-- ==Conversion==\nInformally L'H\u00f4pital's rule states that if derivatives of functions are comparable, then functions themselves are also comparable.

It stars [[Elizabeth Banks]], [[David Denman]], Jackson A. Dunn, [[Matt Jones (actor)|Matt Jones]] and [[Meredith Hagner]]. It follows Brandon Breyer, a young boy of extraterrestrial origin reared on Earth who realizes he has [[Superpower (ability)|superpower]]s. Upon learning of them and being [[brainwashing|brainwashed]] by the ship he arrived in, Brandon rejects his humanity and turns to evil, opting to terrorize his hometown, including his parents. The film is produced and financed by [[Screen Gems]], [[Stage 6 Films]], [[The H Collective]] and Troll Court Entertainment.\n\n''Brightburn'' was announced as ''Untitled James Gunn Horror Project'' in December 2017. Aside from Gunn producing the film, his cousin [[Mark Gunn (screenwriter)|Mark]] and brother [[Brian Gunn]] wrote the screenplay. [[Principal photography]] began in March 2018 and wrapped in May of that same year. It plays the concept of [[Superman]] for explicit horror.\n\n''Brightburn'' was released in the United States on May 24, 2019 by [[Sony Pictures Releasing]]. It received mixed reviews from critics, who praised the horror elements and Banks' performance, but felt that the film did not deliver on the full potential of its premise. The film, however, earned $32 million against a budget of $6\u201312 million. \n\n\nWE WANT MORE bRIGHTbURN IMMEDIATELY!!!\n\n==Plot==\nIn 2006, a spaceship crash-lands in Brightburn, Kansas, on a farm owned by Tori and Kyle Breyer, who have been having difficulties conceiving a child. Inside the ship is an infant child that the couple adopts and name Brandon. They hide the spaceship in their barn's cellar to hide the truth from him.\n\n12 years later in 2018, the ship begins transmitting an alien message, drawing Brandon to it. He sleepwalks to the barn and tries to open the locked cellar, chanting the craft's message, but Tori intervenes and takes him back to the house. The next day as he attempts to mow the lawn, Brandon has difficulty starting the [[lawnmower]] and inadvertently launches it into the air, tossing it more than {{cvt|100|ft}} away. He approaches it, as it is overturned and still running. Curious about his newfound abilities, he stops the motorized blade with his hand.\n\nBrandon displays extremely high intelligence at his school, which other students tease him about, but a girl named Caitlyn consoles him. While celebrating Brandon's 12th birthday at a diner where Caitlyn's mother Erica is the waitress, his  parents' friends Noah and Merilee gift him a hunting rifle, which Kyle refuses to let Brandon have. Brandon insists he should have the rifle and acts insolently, causing a scene, so Kyle and Tori  take him  home immediately. The next morning Kyle suspects something is wrong with Brandon when he finds him absentmindedly chewing and mangling his fork at breakfast. Tori finds photos of lingerie and swimsuit models, surgical diagrams, and graphic photos of human organs in Brandon's room.\n\nBrandon, Kyle, and Tori take a camping trip, and Kyle attempts to give Brandon the \"talk\" about sexuality because he is exhibiting signs of puberty. Encouraged by his father's advice, Brandon sneaks away from the campsite and travels to Caitlyn's house, hiding in her room until she notices him.\n\nReturning home, Kyle observe their chickens in their coop terrified by Brandon, who is standing over them. Later that night, Kyle finds the chickens slaughtered with the coop's locked door torn off its hinges. Kyle insists Brandon was responsible, but Tori insists it was a wolf attack.\n\nDuring a trust fall exercise at school, Brandon falls towards Caitlyn, but she does not catch him, accusing him of being a pervert. When she is forced to help him up, Brandon crushes her hand in retaliation. He is suspended and required to meet with his aunt Merilee, the school counselor, but Erica demands that Brandon be arrested. That night at home, Brandon is drawn to the ship again, and he breaks the lock on the cellar door. Tori interrupts him as he levitates above the open cellar, chanting the ship's message, and he falls and cuts himself on the spaceship, the first time he has ever been injured. Tori reveals the truth about his arrival on Earth, and Brandon angrily leaves, finally understanding the ship's message: \"Take the world.\" In his rage, Brandon develops heat vision. Brandon visits Caitlyn with flowers, who tells him that her mother has forbidden her from talking to him. Wearing a red mask and cape, Brandon stalks Erica while she is closing the diner and murders her. Police investigate the scene, finding a symbol looking like two Bs back-to-back drawn on a window, and Erica is nowhere to be found.\n\nThe following day at school, Brandon is meeting with Merilee, who informs him that she is required to report his progress to police, but he threatens her not to do so. That night, Brandon stalks Merilee through her house until she goes to bed. Noah arrives home from the bar with Kyle and friends to find a masked Brandon hiding in the closet and threatens to tell his parents, prompting Brandon to lash out. Terrified, Noah tries to escape in his truck, but Brandon lifts and crashes the vehicle, killing Noah. He uses Noah's blood to draw the same symbol from Erica's murder on the road. Brandon returns home shirtless, telling his parents that other students tore his shirt while playing soccer late after school, but refuses to give it to Tori.\n\nMerilee calls Kyle and Tori, and they rush to the hospital to learn from a grieving Merilee that Brandon had gone to her house, contradicting Brandon's story about playing soccer. The next morning, Tori and Kyle inform Brandon of Noah's death, but Brandon has no reaction, which alarms Tori and angers Kyle. When Kyle accuses Brandon and grabs him, Brandon violently shoves him. Kyle finds Brandon's blood-stained shirt and shows it to Tori, but she refuses to believe Brandon killed Noah.\n\nKyle plans a hunting trip as an attempt to kill Brandon. While Brandon is examining deer tracks, Kyle shoots him, but the bullet bounces off his head. Brandon kills Kyle with his heat vision. Meanwhile, the town sheriff arrives at the Breyers' house and asks Tori to see Brandon. Tori tells the sheriff that Kyle and Brandon aren't home, so he shows Tori the symbol found at the scenes of Erica's and Noah's deaths. Tori claims ignorance, having seen Brandon drawing the symbol before, but then finds Brandon's notebook with disturbing drawings of his murders and his message to \"take the world\", which brings her to the realization that Kyle was right about Brandon. She attempts to call Kyle, but Brandon answers the phone and informs her that Kyle is gone.\n\nBrandon returns home and destroys the house as Tori calls the police, but Brandon brutally murders the sheriff and his deputy. Remembering that the ship can injure Brandon, Tori runs to the barn. In the cellar, she finds Erica's mutilated body nailed to a wall and surrounded by symbols in blood. Tori arms herself with a piece of the ship to stab Brandon during an embrace but fails when Brandon anticipates the attack. Enraged, Brandon flies Tori through the barn roof and above the clouds and drops her to her death. An airplane flies towards Brandon, and the scene goes dark. The next day, police, paramedics, and FBI are at the farm investigating the airplane crash, which killed everyone on board. News coverage reports that Brandon is the only surviving resident of the area.\n\nDuring the credits, Brandon begins his worldwide attacks which news reports cover. A conspiracy theorist named Big T discusses assorted destruction in Brightburn, the existence of other super-beings, and pleads with humanity to take action.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Div col}}\n* [[Elizabeth Banks]] as Tori Breyer: Brandon's adoptive mother and Kyle's wife\n* [[David Denman]] as Kyle Breyer: Brandon's adoptive father and Tori's husband\n* Jackson A.

It stars [[Elizabeth Banks]], [[David Denman]], Jackson A. Dunn, [[Matt Jones (actor)|Matt Jones]] and [[Meredith Hagner]]. It follows Brandon Breyer, a young boy of extraterrestrial origin reared on Earth who realizes he has [[Superpower (ability)|superpower]]s. Upon learning of them and being [[brainwashing|brainwashed]] by the ship he arrived in, Brandon rejects his humanity and turns to evil, opting to terrorize his hometown, including his parents. The film is produced and financed by [[Screen Gems]], [[Stage 6 Films]], [[The H Collective]] and Troll Court Entertainment.\n\n''Brightburn'' was announced as ''Untitled James Gunn Horror Project'' in December 2017. Aside from Gunn producing the film, his cousin [[Mark Gunn (screenwriter)|Mark]] and brother [[Brian Gunn]] wrote the screenplay. [[Principal photography]] began in March 2018 and wrapped in May of that same year. It plays the concept of [[Superman]] for explicit horror.\n\n''Brightburn'' was released in the United States on May 24, 2019 by [[Sony Pictures Releasing]]. It received mixed reviews from critics, who praised the horror elements and Banks' performance, but felt that the film did not deliver on the full potential of its premise. The film, however, earned $32 million against a budget of $6\u201312 million.\n\n==Plot==\nIn 2006, a spaceship crash-lands in Brightburn, Kansas, on a farm owned by Tori and Kyle Breyer, who have been having difficulties conceiving a child. Inside the ship is an infant child that the couple adopts and name Brandon. They hide the spaceship in their barn's cellar to hide the truth from him.\n\n12 years later in 2018, the ship begins transmitting an alien message, drawing Brandon to it. He sleepwalks to the barn and tries to open the locked cellar, chanting the craft's message, but Tori intervenes and takes him back to the house. The next day as he attempts to mow the lawn, Brandon has difficulty starting the [[lawnmower]] and inadvertently launches it into the air, tossing it more than {{cvt|100|ft}} away. He approaches it, as it is overturned and still running. Curious about his newfound abilities, he stops the motorized blade with his hand.\n\nBrandon displays extremely high intelligence at his school, which other students tease him about, but a girl named Caitlyn consoles him. While celebrating Brandon's 12th birthday at a diner where Caitlyn's mother Erica is the waitress, his  parents' friends Noah and Merilee gift him a hunting rifle, which Kyle refuses to let Brandon have. Brandon insists he should have the rifle and acts insolently, causing a scene, so Kyle and Tori  take him  home immediately. The next morning Kyle suspects something is wrong with Brandon when he finds him absentmindedly chewing and mangling his fork at breakfast. Tori finds photos of lingerie and swimsuit models, surgical diagrams, and graphic photos of human organs in Brandon's room.\n\nBrandon, Kyle, and Tori take a camping trip, and Kyle attempts to give Brandon the \"talk\" about sexuality because he is exhibiting signs of puberty. Encouraged by his father's advice, Brandon sneaks away from the campsite and travels to Caitlyn's house, hiding in her room until she notices him.\n\nReturning home, Kyle observe their chickens in their coop terrified by Brandon, who is standing over them. Later that night, Kyle finds the chickens slaughtered with the coop's locked door torn off its hinges. Kyle insists Brandon was responsible, but Tori insists it was a wolf attack.\n\nDuring a trust fall exercise at school, Brandon falls towards Caitlyn, but she does not catch him, accusing him of being a pervert. When she is forced to help him up, Brandon crushes her hand in retaliation. He is suspended and required to meet with his aunt Merilee, the school counselor, but Erica demands that Brandon be arrested. That night at home, Brandon is drawn to the ship again, and he breaks the lock on the cellar door. Tori interrupts him as he levitates above the open cellar, chanting the ship's message, and he falls and cuts himself on the spaceship, the first time he has ever been injured. Tori reveals the truth about his arrival on Earth, and Brandon angrily leaves, finally understanding the ship's message: \"Take the world.\" In his rage, Brandon develops heat vision. Brandon visits Caitlyn with flowers, who tells him that her mother has forbidden her from talking to him. Wearing a red mask and cape, Brandon stalks Erica while she is closing the diner and murders her. Police investigate the scene, finding a symbol looking like two Bs back-to-back drawn on a window, and Erica is nowhere to be found.\n\nThe following day at school, Brandon is meeting with Merilee, who informs him that she is required to report his progress to police, but he threatens her not to do so. That night, Brandon stalks Merilee through her house until she goes to bed. Noah arrives home from the bar with Kyle and friends to find a masked Brandon hiding in the closet and threatens to tell his parents, prompting Brandon to lash out. Terrified, Noah tries to escape in his truck, but Brandon lifts and crashes the vehicle, killing Noah. He uses Noah's blood to draw the same symbol from Erica's murder on the road. Brandon returns home shirtless, telling his parents that other students tore his shirt while playing soccer late after school, but refuses to give it to Tori.\n\nMerilee calls Kyle and Tori, and they rush to the hospital to learn from a grieving Merilee that Brandon had gone to her house, contradicting Brandon's story about playing soccer. The next morning, Tori and Kyle inform Brandon of Noah's death, but Brandon has no reaction, which alarms Tori and angers Kyle. When Kyle accuses Brandon and grabs him, Brandon violently shoves him. Kyle finds Brandon's blood-stained shirt and shows it to Tori, but she refuses to believe Brandon killed Noah.\n\nKyle plans a hunting trip as an attempt to kill Brandon. While Brandon is examining deer tracks, Kyle shoots him, but the bullet bounces off his head. Brandon kills Kyle with his heat vision. Meanwhile, the town sheriff arrives at the Breyers' house and asks Tori to see Brandon. Tori tells the sheriff that Kyle and Brandon aren't home, so he shows Tori the symbol found at the scenes of Erica's and Noah's deaths. Tori claims ignorance, having seen Brandon drawing the symbol before, but then finds Brandon's notebook with disturbing drawings of his murders and his message to \"take the world\", which brings her to the realization that Kyle was right about Brandon. She attempts to call Kyle, but Brandon answers the phone and informs her that Kyle is gone.\n\nBrandon returns home and destroys the house as Tori calls the police, but Brandon brutally murders the sheriff and his deputy. Remembering that the ship can injure Brandon, Tori runs to the barn. In the cellar, she finds Erica's mutilated body nailed to a wall and surrounded by symbols in blood. Tori arms herself with a piece of the ship to stab Brandon during an embrace but fails when Brandon anticipates the attack. Enraged, Brandon flies Tori through the barn roof and above the clouds and drops her to her death. An airplane flies towards Brandon, and the scene goes dark. The next day, police, paramedics, and FBI are at the farm investigating the airplane crash, which killed everyone on board. News coverage reports that Brandon is the only surviving resident of the area.\n\nDuring the credits, Brandon begins his worldwide attacks which news reports cover. A conspiracy theorist named Big T discusses assorted destruction in Brightburn, the existence of other super-beings, and pleads with humanity to take action.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Div col}}\n* [[Elizabeth Banks]] as Tori Breyer: Brandon's adoptive mother and Kyle's wife\n* [[David Denman]] as Kyle Breyer: Brandon's adoptive father and Tori's husband\n* Jackson A.

Its complete designation, SKS-45, is an [[initialism]] for '''Samozaryadny Karabin sistemy Simonova, 1945''' ({{lang-ru|\u0421\u0430\u043c\u043e\u0437\u0430\u0440\u044f\u0434\u043d\u044b\u0439 \u043a\u0430\u0440\u0430\u0431\u0438\u043d \u0441\u0438\u0441\u0442\u0435\u043c\u044b \u0421\u0438\u043c\u043e\u043d\u043e\u0432\u0430}}, 1945; Self-loading Carbine of (the) Simonov system, 1945). The SKS-45 was manufactured at Tula Arsenal from 1945 to 1958 and at Izhevsk Arsenal in just 1953 and 1954, resulting in a total Soviet production of about 2.7 million carbines. In the early 1950s, the Soviets took the SKS carbine out of front-line service and replaced it with the [[AK-47]]; however, the SKS remained in second-line service for decades.\n\nIt is still used as a ceremonial firearm today. The SKS was widely exported, and was also licensed for production by then [[Eastern Bloc]] nations Romania and East Germany, as well as China, where it was designated the \"Type 56 Carbine\". The [[East German]] version was known as the '''''Karabiner S''''', the Albanian as the Model 561, and [[North Korea]]n as the \"Type 63\". The SKS is popular on the civilian surplus market as a hunting and marksmanship semi-automatic rifle in many countries, including the United States and Canada. Its age and numbers make it relatively inexpensive to purchase, and steel cased 7.62\u00d739mm ammunition is one of the least expensive center fire cartridges currently on the market.\n\n== Design ==\n[[File:SKS Ladestreifen.jpg|thumb|left|The SKS can be quickly reloaded using disposable 10-round stripper clips.

It is a [[Gas-operated reloading|gas-operated]] rifle that has a spring-loaded [[Bolt (firearms)|bolt]] carrier and a [[Gas-operated reloading#Short-stroke piston|gas piston operating rod]] that work to unlock and cycle the action via gas pressure exerting pressure against them. The bolt is locked to contain the pressure of ignition at the moment of firing by tilting downwards at its rear and being held by a lug milled into the receiver.  At the moment of firing, the bolt carrier is pushed rearwards, which causes it to lift the bolt, unlocking it, and allowing it to be carried rearwards against a spring.  This allows the fired case to be ejected and a new round from the magazine to be carried into the chamber. The SKS represents an intermediate step in the process towards the development of true assault rifles,  being shorter and less powerful than the semi-automatic rifles that preceded it, such as the Soviet [[SVT-40]], but being longer (10&nbsp;cm or 4in) than AK-series rifles which replaced it.  As a result, it has a slightly higher muzzle velocity than those arms that replaced it.\n\nThe SKS's ten-round internal [[box magazine]] can be loaded either by hand or from a [[stripper clip]]. Cartridges stored in the magazine can be removed by pulling back on a latch located forward of the trigger guard (thus opening the \"floor\" of the magazine and allowing the rounds to fall out).<ref name=\"pdf.textfiles\">http://pdf.textfiles.com/manuals/MILITARY/united_states_army_tc_9-56%20-%201_october_1969.pdf {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121224023008/http://pdf.textfiles.com/manuals/MILITARY/united_states_army_tc_9-56%20-%201_october_1969.pdf |date=2012-12-24 }} | TC 9\u201356, Department of the Army Training Circular, SKS RIFLE, Simonov Type 56, Headquarters, Department of the Army, October 1969</ref> In typical military use the stripper clips are disposable. If necessary they can be reloaded multiple times and reused.\n\nWhile early (1949\u201350) Soviet models had spring-loaded firing pins, which held the pin away from cartridge primers until struck by the action's hammer, most variants of the SKS have a free floating firing pin within the bolt. Because of this design, care must be taken during cleaning (especially after long storage packed in Cosmoline) to ensure that the firing pin can freely move and does not stick in the forward position within the bolt. SKS firing pins that are stuck in the forward position have been known to cause accidental \"slamfires\" (the rifle firing on its own, without pulling the trigger and often without being fully locked). This behavior is less likely with the hard primer military-spec ammo for which the SKS was designed, but as with any rifle, users should properly maintain their firearms. For collectors, slamfires are more likely when the bolt still has remnants of [[Cosmoline]] embedded in it that retards firing pin movement. As it is triangular in cross section with only one way to properly insert it (notches up), slamfires can also result if the firing pin is inserted in one of the other two orientations.\n\nIn most variants (Yugoslav models being the most notable exception), the barrel is chrome-lined for increased wear and heat tolerance from sustained fire and to resist corrosion from chlorate-primed corrosive ammunition, as well as to facilitate cleaning. Chrome bore lining is common in military rifles. Although it can diminish accuracy, its effect on practical accuracy in a rifle of this type is limited.\n\nThe front sight has a hooded post. The rear sight is an open notch type which is adjustable for elevation from {{convert|100|to|1000|m|yd}}. There is also an all-purpose \"battle\" setting on the sight ladder (marked \"\u041f\", for \"\u041f\u0440\u044f\u043c\u043e\u0439 \u0432\u044b\u0441\u0442\u0440\u0435\u043b\", meaning \"Straight shot\"), set for {{convert|300|m|yd|abbr=off}}.

The rifle has a cleaning kit stored in a trapdoor in the buttstock, with a cleaning rod running under the barrel, in the same style as the AK-47. The cap for the cleaning kit also serves as a cleaning rod guide, to protect the crown from being damaged during cleaning. The body of the cleaning kit serves as the cleaning rod handle. In common with some other Soviet-era designs, it trades some accuracy for ruggedness, reliability, ease of maintenance, ease of use, and low manufacturing cost.\n\n==History==\nDuring [[World War II]], many countries realized that existing rifles, such as the [[Mosin\u2013Nagant]], were too long and heavy and fired powerful cartridges that were effective in medium machine guns with a range in excess of {{convert|2000|m|yd}}, creating excessive recoil. These cartridges, such as the [[7.92\u00d757mm Mauser|8\u00d757mm Mauser]], [[.303 British]], [[.30-06 Springfield]], and [[7.62\u00d754mmR]] were effective in rifles to ranges of up to {{convert|1000|m|yd|abbr=off}}; however, it was noted that most firefights took place at maximum ranges of between {{convert|100|and|300|m|yd|abbr=off}}. Only a highly trained specialist, such as a [[sniper]], could employ the full-power rifle cartridge to its true potential. Both the Soviet Union and Germany realized this and designed new firearms for smaller, intermediate-power cartridges. The U.S. fielded an intermediate round in the .30 (7.62 [[millimetre|mm]]) U.S., now known as the [[.30 Carbine]]; used in the [[M1 carbine]], it was widely used by American forces in WWII but was much weaker than German and Soviet intermediate rounds, and was never intended to replace the .30-06 rifle cartridge.\n\nThe German approach was the production of a series of intermediate cartridges and rifles in the interwar period, eventually developing the ''Maschinenkarabiner'', or machine-carbine, which later evolved into the  [[StG 44|Sturmgewehr 44]], which was produced in large numbers during the war, and chambered in the [[7.92\u00d733mm Kurz]] intermediate round.\n\nThe Soviet Union type qualified a new intermediate round in 1943, at the same time it began to field the [[Mosin\u2013Nagant]] M44 carbine as a general issue small arm. However, the M44, which had a side-folding bayonet and shorter overall length, still fired the full-powered round of its predecessors. A small number of SKS rifles were tested on the front line in early 1945 against the Germans in World War II.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://modernfirearms.net/en/military-rifles/self-loading-rifles/russia-self-loading-rifles/simonov-sks-eng/ |title=SKS Simonov -- Modern Firearms |publisher=Modernfirearms.net |date= |access-date=2018-02-09 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180215052642/http://modernfirearms.net/en/military-rifles/self-loading-rifles/russia-self-loading-rifles/simonov-sks-eng/ |archive-date=2018-02-15 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\nDesign-wise, the SKS relies on the [[AVS-36]] (developed by the same designer, Simonov) to a point that some consider it a shortened AVS-36, stripped of select-fire capability and re-chambered for the 7.62\u00d739mm cartridge.<ref>Vadim Ribakov, [https://web.archive.org/web/20040614201935/http://www.sksboards.com/sksinfo/SARSKS.html OP-SKS: Hunting Carbine], ''Small Arms Review'', Vol. 4 No. 8, May, 2001</ref> This viewpoint is problematic, as the AVS uses a sliding block bolt locking device, while the SKS employs a more reliable tilting-bolt design inherited from the [[PTRS-41]], which it it's self took from [[SVT-40]]. The bolt mechanism is one of the defining features of a rifle, having a different bolt means the SKS and AVS merely appear similar in layout, while differing vastly in bolt lockup, caliber, size, and that one has a fixed magazine and the other has a detachable magazine. It also owes a debt to the M44, incorporating the carbine size and integral bayonet.\n\nIn 1949, the SKS was officially adopted into the [[Soviet Army]], manufactured at the [[Tula Arms Plant|Tula Armory]] from 1949 until 1955 and the [[Izhevsk Mechanical Plant]] in 1953 and 1954. Although the quality of Soviet carbines manufactured at these state-run arsenals was quite high, its design was already obsolete compared to the Kalashnikov which was [[Selective fire|selective-fire]], lighter, had three times the magazine capacity, and had the potential to be less labor-intensive to manufacture. Gradually over the next few years, AK-47 production increased until the extant SKS carbines in service were relegated primarily to non-infantry and to second-line troops. They remained in service in this fashion even as late as the 1980s, and possibly the early 1990s. To this day, the SKS carbine is used by some ceremonial Russian [[honor guard]]s, much the same way the [[M14 Rifle]] is within the United States; it is far less ubiquitous than the AK-47 but both original Soviet SKS rifles and copies can still be found today in civilian hands as well as in the hands of third-world militias and insurgent groups.\n\nThe SKS was to be a gap-filling firearm manufactured using the proven operating mechanism design of the [[14.5\u00d7114mm]] PTRS-41 [[anti-tank rifle]] and using proven milled forging manufacturing techniques. This was to provide a fallback for the radically new and experimental design of the AK-47, in the event that the AK proved to be a failure. In fact, the original [[Stamping (metalworking)|stamped]] receiver AK-47 had to be quickly redesigned to use a milled receiver which delayed production, and extended the SKS carbine's service life.\n\n==Service==\n[[File:Vietcong1968.jpg|right|thumb|upright| A guerilla of the [[People's Liberation Armed Forces of South Vietnam]], crouching in a tunnel, holding an SKS carbine.]]\n\nAlmost as soon as the SKS was brought into service in 1949, it was rendered obsolete for Soviet purposes by the new AK-47, which was adopted by the Soviet military later that year. However, it found a long second life in the service of other Soviet-aligned countries, in particular the Chinese army, who found it well suited to their own style of warfare, the \"People's War\" whose main actors were highly mobile, self-reliant guerrilla bands and rural militias protecting their own villages. In the philosophy of \"the People's War\", the emphasis was on long-range sniping, spoiling attacks, and ambushes. For this the Chinese army preferred its own domestic version of the SKS (the Type 56 carbine) to the AK pattern.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://baike.baidu.com/view/559379.htm|title=56\u5f0f\u534a\u81ea\u52a8\u6b65\u67aa _\u767e\u5ea6\u767e\u79d1|publisher=|access-date=26 November 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151019015401/http://baike.baidu.com/view/559379.htm|archive-date=19 October 2015|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nFrom its introduction in 1956, the Type 56/SKS remained the workhorse of the [[People's Liberation Army]] (PLA) for 30 years. In 1968, the army was briefly re-equipped with the unsuccessful [[Type 63 assault rifle]], which had been intended to combine the sustained firepower of China's first AK-47 variant (confusingly called the \"[[Type 56 assault rifle]]\") with the precise semi-automatic fire of the SKS/Type 56 carbine and replace both of those separate rifles. However, by the mid-1970s, all manner of problems were plaguing the unreliable Type 63 rifle. Troops clamored to be given back their carbines, which had been redistributed to local militia units, and the army staff abandoned the Type 63 and returned the Type 56 carbine (SKS) and Type 56 assault rifle (AK-47) back into service. The standard practice was for squad leaders and assistant squad leaders to carry an assault rifle and for most other soldiers to carry a carbine, so that a front-line infantry squad fielded two assault rifles, two light machine guns, and seven carbines.\n\nHowever, after the beginning of [[Sino-Vietnamese War|China's 1979 border war with Vietnam]], Chinese combat units found that the SKS carbine's capacity for long-range precision fire was of little use in the mountain jungles of the border region; as a result those units were hastily re-equipped with assault rifles. Rifles of the AK family (including both the Chinese army\u2019s Type 56 auto and the Vietnamese army\u2019s AK-47s and AKM) are for structural reasons relatively inaccurate,{{dubious|date=December 2018}} and because the Chinese army has historically favored precision fire (despite generally having firearms ill-suited to that task), the Sino-Vietnamese war directly hastened development of the PLA\u2019s [[Type 81 assault rifle]].{{citation needed|date=December 2018}} By the time border conflict broke out again between China and Vietnam in 1983, the Chinese military had already been completely re-equipped with their more accurate, precise Type 81 assault rifle.<ref>[[:zh:56\u5f0f\u534a\u81ea\u52a8\u6b65\u67aa]]</ref> However the Type 56 carbine still remains in service with Chinese militias and reserve forces. The Type 56 also is in front line use as a drill and ceremony rifle.\n\nMany surplus SKS rifles were disposed of in the 1990s, and photographs and stories exist of SKS rifles used by guerrilla fighters in [[Bosnia and Herzegovina|Bosnia]], [[Somalia]] and throughout Africa and Southeast Asia<ref>{{cite news | url=http://www.smh.com.au/articles/2003/01/24/1042911548582.html?oneclick=true | work=The Sydney Morning Herald | title=Refugees 'forced to become guerrillas' | date=January 25, 2003 | access-date=January 26, 2005 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070208210809/http://www.smh.com.au/articles/2003/01/24/1042911548582.html?oneclick=true | archive-date=February 8, 2007 | url-status=live }}</ref> during the 1990s and well into the 21st century. Several African, Asian, and Middle Eastern armies still use the SKS.\n\nDuring the [[Cold War]], the Soviet Union shared the SKS design and manufacturing details with its allies, and as a result, many variants of the SKS exist. Some variants use gas port controls, flip-up night sights, and prominent, muzzle-mounted grenade launchers (Yugoslav M59/66, possibly North Korean Type 63). In total, SKS rifles were manufactured by the Soviet Union, China, [[Yugoslavia]], Albania, [[North Korea]], [[North Vietnam]], [[East Germany]] (Kar. S) and (Model 56) in Romania. Physically, all are very similar, although the [[NATO]]-specification 22mm grenade launcher of the Yugoslav version, and the more encompassing stock of the Albanian version are visually distinctive. Many smaller parts, most notably the sights and charging handles, were unique to different national production runs. A small quantity of SKS carbines manufactured in 1955\u201356 was produced in China with Russian parts, presumably as part of a technology sharing arrangement. The vast majority of Yugoslav M59 and M59/66s have [[elm]], [[walnut]] and [[beech]] stocks.

Most of these nations produced nearly identical variants, with the most common modifications being differing styles of bayonets and the [[22 mm grenade|22 mm]] [[rifle grenade]] launcher commonly seen on Yugoslavian models.\n\n===Soviet===\nDifferences from the \"baseline\" late Russian Tula Armory/Izhevsk Armory SKS:\n\n* '''Variations (1949\u20131958)''': Early Spike-style bayonet (1949) instead of blade-style. Spring-return firing pin was present on early models, and they did not have chrome bores (1949 \u2013 early 1951). The gas block had three changes: The first production stage gas block, used from 1949 through early 1950, was squared-off at a 90-degree angle. The second gas block production stage was instead cut at a 45-degree angle, seen on late 1950 to 1951 rifles. The third and final gas block stage, from 1952 through to 1956, was curved inward slightly toward the action.\n* '''Honor Guard''': All-chrome metal parts, with a lighter-colored wood stock.\n*'''OP-SKS'''.

All of the Type 56 carbine rifles have been removed from military service, except a few being used for ceremonial purposes and by local [[Chinese Militia]]s. Type 56 carbines with serial numbers below 9,000,000 have the Russian-style blade-type folding bayonet, while those 9,000,000 and higher have a \"spike\" type folding bayonet.

The Type 81 is an upgraded Type 68 with a three-round burst capability, some of which (Type 81-1) have a folding stock. The Type 84 (known as an SKK) returns to semi-auto fire only, is modified to accept AK-47 magazines, and has a shorter 16\" paratrooper barrel. However, Chinese Type 84s could not accept AK mags without some handfitting, and the mags were serialized. In addition, AK mags don\u2019t work with the SKS bolt-hold-open system, so the Type 84 used a button on top of the bolt carrier to lock it into place. <ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.recoilweb.com/the-hottest-cashier-at-dollar-tree-139825.html |title=SKS Rifle: The Hottest Cashier at Dollar Tree |work=RECOIL |language=en-US}}</ref>\n\n[[File:SKS-M.png|thumb|Norinco SKS-M with Monte Carlo cheek-piece stock and detachable 30-round AK-47 magazine]]\n* '''Commercial production''': Blonde wood ([[Catalpa|\"Chu wood\"/\"Qiu wood\"]])<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://yooperj.com/SKS-18.htm |title=Yooper John's SKS \u2013 Battle rifle of many nations |access-date=2011-07-01 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120108032414/http://yooperj.com/SKS-18.htm |archive-date=2012-01-08 |url-status=live }}</ref> stock instead of dark wood, spike bayonet instead of blade, bayonet retaining bolt replaced with a rivet.

Polish laminated stocks lack storage area in back of stock for cleaning kit. A few hundred SKS's were given to Poland by the Soviet Union around 1954. While never adopted for use by combat units, the SKS is still in use in ceremonial units of the Polish Army, Air Force, Navy where they replaced [[SVT-40|SVT]] rifles. Honor guards of the Polish Police and Border Guard also use SKS carbines. In Polish service they are known as '''ksS''' which stands for ''karabin samopowtarzalny Simonowa'', Simonov's semi-automatic rifle.

There were no rifles produced from 1972 to 1975. Produced by the UM GRAMSH factory located in Gramsh, Albania. Longer stock and handguard on the gas tube, and AK style charging handle. The magazine is slightly different in the shape visible from the outside. The stock has two compartments with two corresponding holes in the buttplate for cleaning implements instead of the single cleaning kit pocket.

Nearly identical to both the Soviet and Sino-Soviet SKS. These are identified by a small star on the receiver with a 1 in the center. The barrel is chromed, as are many of the internal parts. It is unknown currently whether there are spiked bayonets or only bladed. The stock work is identical to more common SKS variants such as the Soviet and Chinese.

The Chinese SKSs varied significantly even among new rifles with some having screwed in barrels, milled trigger groups and bolt carriers with lightening reliefs cut into them being at the top end and cheaper rifles having pinned barrels, stamped trigger groups and slab-sided bolt carriers \u2013 though overall quality and serviceability remained high. The main reason for the manufacturing variance comes from differences between rifles made for the Chinese army and those made for export.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.milsurps.com/showthread.php?t=26665 |title=Chinese SKS Type 56 ID FAQ<!-- Bot generated title --> |access-date=2015-07-26 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151005074219/http://www.milsurps.com/showthread.php?t=26665 |archive-date=2015-10-05 |url-status=live }}</ref> The Chinese types typically have [[Chrome plating|chrome]]-lined barrels while the Yugoslav versions do not, resulting in some Yugoslavian carbines having bores in considerably worse condition than even the cheapest Chinese SKSs. The Yugo M59/66 rifles also are unique in having a gas shut off valve for grenade launching, which is a common source of malfunctions.  While often encountered in well-used condition, Romanian carbines were as well-built as the Soviet versions. In general, carbines made in the USSR are considered the highest quality.\n\nThe interchangeability of many parts has resulted in carbines on the U.S. market that are a mixture of different parts of varying quality, sometimes including parts from different countries, often with non-standard after-market parts. Such rifles are usually referred to as \"parts guns\" and are generally considered the least-desirable carbines encountered. Even so, they are significantly cheaper than comparable semi-automatic rifles and can be expected to offer reliable performance.\n\nNorth Korean, Vietnamese, East German, and Albanian SKSs bring a higher price than those of other countries. Soviet and Romanian carbines have largely reached price parity, with Chinese carbines somewhat lower in price. The stock on the Albanian versions is of a slightly different manufacture and these were made in low production numbers. There were approximately 18,000 Albanian SKSs manufactured during the late 1960s until 1978, and of those, approximately half were destroyed. Most of the remaining [[East Germany|East German]] SKSs had been sold/transferred to [[Croatia]] in the early 1990s.\n\n==Accuracy potential==\n{{Expand Russian|SKS|date=February 2016}}\n\nThe following table lists accuracy statistics for an SKS rifle firing 57-N-231 steel core service ammunition.  The statistics were computed under the Russian method for determining accuracy, which is more complex than Western methods which usually involve firing a group of shots and then measuring the overall diameter of the group.  The Russian method differs in that after a group of shots is fired into the target, two circles are drawn, one for the maximum vertical dispersion of hits and one for the maximum horizontal dispersion of hits.  Hits on the outer part of the target are disregarded, while only half of the hits on the inner part of the circles are counted (50% or R<sub>50</sub>), which significantly reduces the overall diameter of the groups.  The vertical and horizontal measurements of the reduced groups are then used to measure accuracy. This [[circular error probable]] method used by the Russian and other European militaries cannot be converted and is not comparable to US military methods for determining rifle accuracy. When the R<sub>50</sub> results are doubled the hit probability increases to 93.7%.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center;\"\n!colspan=\"5\"|SKS dispersion with 57-N-231 steel core service ammunition<ref name=\"\u043c\u0430\u043d\u0443\u0430\u043b\">Instruction on small business. 7.62mm SKS. 1962</ref><br />\n|-\n!Range||Vertical accuracy of fire (R<sub>50</sub>)||Horizontal accuracy of fire (R<sub>50</sub>)||Remaining bullet energy||Remaining bullet velocity\n|-\n|{{convert|0|m|yd|0|abbr=on}}||{{convert|0|cm|in|1|abbr=on}}||{{convert|0|cm|in|1|abbr=on}}||{{convert|2134|J|ftlbf|abbr=on}}||{{convert|735|m/s|ft/s|0|abbr=on}}\n|-\n|{{convert|100|m|yd|0|abbr=on}}||{{convert|3|cm|in|1|abbr=on}}||{{convert|2|cm|in|1|abbr=on}}||{{convert|1618|J|ftlbf|abbr=on}}||{{convert|640|m/s|ft/s|0|abbr=on}}\n|-\n|{{convert|200|m|yd|0|abbr=on}}||{{convert|6|cm|in|1|abbr=on}}||{{convert|4|cm|in|1|abbr=on}}||{{convert|1226|J|ftlbf|abbr=on}}||{{convert|557|m/s|ft/s|0|abbr=on}}\n|-\n|{{convert|300|m|yd|0|abbr=on}}||{{convert|9|cm|in|1|abbr=on}}||{{convert|7|cm|in|1|abbr=on}}||{{convert|932|J|ftlbf|abbr=on}}||{{convert|486|m/s|ft/s|0|abbr=on}}\n|-\n|{{convert|400|m|yd|0|abbr=on}}||{{convert|12|cm|in|1|abbr=on}}||{{convert|10|cm|in|1|abbr=on}}||{{convert|716|J|ftlbf|abbr=on}}||{{convert|426|m/s|ft/s|0|abbr=on}}\n|-\n|{{convert|500|m|yd|0|abbr=on}}||{{convert|17|cm|in|1|abbr=on}}||{{convert|14|cm|in|1|abbr=on}}||{{convert|559|J|ftlbf|abbr=on}}||{{convert|367|m/s|ft/s|0|abbr=on}}\n|-\n|{{convert|600|m|yd|0|abbr=on}}||{{convert|23|cm|in|1|abbr=on}}||{{convert|19|cm|in|1|abbr=on}}||{{convert|441|J|ftlbf|abbr=on}}||{{convert|334|m/s|ft/s|0|abbr=on}}\n|-\n|{{convert|700|m|yd|0|abbr=on}}||{{convert|30|cm|in|1|abbr=on}}||{{convert|24|cm|in|1|abbr=on}}||{{convert|353|J|ftlbf|abbr=on}}||{{convert|299|m/s|ft/s|0|abbr=on}}\n|-\n|{{convert|800|m|yd|0|abbr=on}}||{{convert|38|cm|in|1|abbr=on}}||{{convert|29|cm|in|1|abbr=on}}||{{convert|304|J|ftlbf|abbr=on}}||{{convert|277|m/s|ft/s|0|abbr=on}}\n|-\n|{{convert|900|m|yd|0|abbr=on}}||{{convert|47|cm|in|1|abbr=on}}||{{convert|34|cm|in|1|abbr=on}}||{{convert|265|J|ftlbf|abbr=on}}||{{convert|259|m/s|ft/s|0|abbr=on}}\n|-\n|{{convert|1000|m|yd|0|abbr=on}}||{{convert|57|cm|in|1|abbr=on}}||{{convert|40|cm|in|1|abbr=on}}||{{convert|235|J|ftlbf|abbr=on}}||{{convert|244|m/s|ft/s|0|abbr=on}}\n|}\n\n* <small>R<sub>50</sub> means the closest 50 percent of the shot group will all be within a circle of the mentioned diameter.</small>\n\nIn general, this is an improvement with respect to firing accuracy to the AK-47 and the AKM.

market, especially in Canada and the United States. Because of their historic and novel nature, Soviet and European SKS carbines are classified by the [[BATF]] as [[Collectors of Curio and Relic Firearms|\"Curio & Relic\"]] items under U.S. law, allowing them to be sold with features that might otherwise be restricted. Chinese manufactured rifles, even the rare early \"Sino-Soviet\" examples, are not so classified, though the \"Sino-Soviet\" rifles qualify for automatic Curio & Relic status due to being manufactured over 50 years ago. Because of the massive size of the Chinese [[People's Liberation Army]], over 8 million Chinese SKS rifles were manufactured during their 20 years of use making the Chinese SKS one of the most mass-produced military rifles of all time although still far behind its successor the [[AK-47]].\n\nIn Canada, the large flux of imported SKS rifles has driven prices down to around $200\u2013$300 per Russian SKS. The Chinese Norinco SKS can be bought for slightly less. As with most military surplus rifles, they are coated in [[cosmoline]] for the preservation of the firearm while under storage for decades at a time. Along with a large supply of bulk 7.62\u00d739mm surplus ammunition, SKS rifles have become a popular firearm for civilian ownership.\n\nIn Australia, SKS rifles were very popular with recreational hunters and target shooters during the 1980s and early 1990s before [[Military-Style Semi-Automatic|semi-automatic rifles]] were [[Gun politics in Australia|restricted from legal ownership in 1996]]. Since the introduction of the 1996 gun restrictions in Australia, the [[Mosin\u2013Nagant]] series of bolt-action rifles and carbines have now filled the void created when the SKS was restricted from legal ownership.\n[[File:SKS modified.jpg|thumb|A [[sporterized]] SKS carbine fitted with an aftermarket composite stock and weaver rail.]]\nIn the early 1990s, the Chinese SKS rapidly became the \"poor man's deer rifle\" in the United States due to its low price, lower even than such old favorites in that role as the [[Marlin Model 336|Marlin 336]]. Importation of the Chinese SKS into the U.S.A. was banned in the [[Federal_Assault_Weapons_Ban|Federal Assault Weapons Ban]] of 1994.\n\nDue to its relatively low cost and widespread availability and usage, the SKS has spawned a growing market for both replacement parts and accessories. Many aftermarket parts are available to modify the carbine\u2014sometimes so considerably that it bears little resemblance to the original firearm. This may include items such as synthetic [[gun stock|stocks]], pistol grips, higher capacity [[Magazine (firearms)|magazine]]s, replacement [[receiver (firearms)|receiver]] covers (to allow the mounting of [[Telescopic sight|scopes]], [[laser]]s, etc.), different [[muzzle brake]]s, recoil buffers, bipods, and more.\n\n==Legal issues==\nThe carbine's integral 10-round magazine is not an issue in those states and nations which prohibit higher-capacity magazines, except Canada.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cfc-cafc.gc.ca/faq/default_e.asp#a6|title=Canada firearm regulations pertaining to magazine capacity|publisher=|access-date=26 November 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070730232453/http://www.cfc-cafc.gc.ca/faq/default_e.asp#a6|archive-date=30 July 2007|url-status=live}}</ref> In the case for Canada, the SKS is classified as a non-restricted firearm and the magazine must be pinned to five rounds or the rifles must be retrofitted with five-shot magazines.  However, although the 7.62\u00d739mm round is generally compared to the American Winchester [[.30-30]], many states have laws against hunting rifles with magazines of more than five rounds. Magazine plugs limiting the magazine to five rounds must be used for hunting in these states.\n\nWhile aftermarket detachable magazines may be simple to install, doing so may be illegal under certain circumstances or even in some vicinities. They are also banned in [[Cook County, Illinois|Cook County]], [[Illinois]], which includes [[Chicago]] and many suburbs, although as of the 2010 [[McDonald v. Chicago]] US Supreme Court decision, the City of Chicago ordinance allows removable magazines, creating a confusing situation for firearm owners.\n\n[[United States Code|U.S.C.]] [[U.S.C. 922(r)|922 (r)]], which regulates imported rifles with certain features the [[BATFE]] defines as not being suitable for sporting purposes requires ten \"compliance parts\" (out of a list of 20 possible parts) of U.S. manufacture to be installed on any modified SKS.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Saiga semi-automatic rifle]]\n* [[Ruger Mini-30]]\n* [[WASR series rifles]]\n* [[CZ 527]]\n* [[AK-47]]\n* [[AKM]]\n* [[AK-103]]\n* [[TKB-517]]\n* [[vz. 52 rifle]]\n* [[vz. 58]]\n* [[FN Model 1949]]\n* [[Table of handgun and rifle cartridges]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|colwidth=30em}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Commons category}}\n*[https://www.marstar.ca/html/reflibrary/Manuals/sks.html Soviet SKS Operation Manual from 1974]\n* {{Internet Archive short film|id=gov.dod.dimoc.26977|name=STAFF FILM REPORT 66-25A (1966)}} {{in lang|it}}\n*[http://www.armimilitari.it/wordpress/1321/simonov-sks/ Simonov SKS (CKC45g)]\n*[https://www.rockislandauction.com/blog/why-do-people-like-sks-rifles/ Why is the SKS Rifle Popular?]\n\n{{Soviet infantry weapons of World War II}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Sks}}\n[[Category:7.62\u00d739mm semi-automatic rifles]]\n[[Category:Semi-automatic rifles of the Soviet Union]]\n[[Category:Carbines]]\n[[Category:Short stroke piston firearms]]\n[[Category:World War II infantry weapons of the Soviet Union]]\n[[Category:Rifles of the Cold War]]\n[[Category:Cold War weapons of the Soviet Union]]\n[[Category:Infantry weapons of the Cold War]]\n[[Category:Tula Arms Plant products]]\n", "text_old": "{{Other uses2\n|SKS}}\n{{Infobox weapon|is_ranged=yes\n|name=SKS\n| image= Simonow SKS 45 noBG.jpg\n| image_size = 300\n|caption=SKS Carbine from the collections of [[Arm\u00e9museum]], Stockholm, Sweden\n|origin= [[Soviet Union]] <!-- WP:INFOBOXFLAG -->\n|type=[[Semi-automatic rifle|Semi-automatic]] [[carbine]]\n|designer=[[Sergei Gavrilovich Simonov]]\n|design_date= 1944\n|service=1945\u2013present\n|used_by= See ''[[#Users|Users]]''\n|wars= See ''[[#Conflicts|Conflicts]]''\n|cartridge=[[7.62\u00d739mm]] M43<ref name=\"pdf.textfiles\"/>\n|action= Short stroke gas piston, [[tilting bolt]], self-loading\n|rate=[[Semi-automatic firearm|Semi-automatic]] 35\u201340 (rd/min)<ref name=\"pdf.textfiles\" />\n|velocity={{convert|735|m/s|0|abbr=on}}<ref name=\"pdf.textfiles\" />\n|range={{convert|400|m|yd}}<ref name=\"pdf.textfiles\" />\n|weight={{convert|3.85|kg|abbr=on}}<ref name=\"pdf.textfiles\" />\n|length={{convert|1020|mm|abbr=on}},<ref name=\"pdf.textfiles\" /><br/>M59/66: {{convert|1120|mm|abbr=on}}\n|part_length={{convert|520|mm|abbr=on}},<ref name=\"pdf.textfiles\" /><br/> M59/66: {{convert|558.8|mm|abbr=on}}\n|feed=10 round [[stripper clip]],<ref name=\"pdf.textfiles\" /> internal [[box magazine]].\n|sights=Hooded post front sight, tangent notch rear sight graduated from 100 to 1,000 meters.<ref name=\"pdf.textfiles\" />\n|variants=Chinese Type 56; Yugoslav PAP; Romanian SKS; Albanian SKS; East German SKS; (North) Vietnamese SKS; North Korean SKS\n|number=15,000,000+<ref name=\"hogg2002\"/>\n}}\n\nThe '''SKS'''(Semi-automatic carbine of Simonov)  is a [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] [[Semi-automatic firearm|semi-automatic]] [[carbine]] chambered for the [[7.62\u00d739mm]] round, designed in 1943 by [[Sergei Gavrilovich Simonov]]. Its complete designation, SKS-45, is an [[initialism]] for '''Samozaryadny Karabin sistemy Simonova, 1945''' ({{lang-ru|\u0421\u0430\u043c\u043e\u0437\u0430\u0440\u044f\u0434\u043d\u044b\u0439 \u043a\u0430\u0440\u0430\u0431\u0438\u043d \u0441\u0438\u0441\u0442\u0435\u043c\u044b \u0421\u0438\u043c\u043e\u043d\u043e\u0432\u0430}}, 1945; Self-loading Carbine of (the) Simonov system, 1945). The SKS-45 was manufactured at Tula Arsenal from 1945 to 1958 and at Izhevsk Arsenal in just 1953 and 1954, resulting in a total Soviet production of about 2.7 million carbines. In the early 1950s, the Soviets took the SKS carbine out of front-line service and replaced it with the [[AK-47]]; however, the SKS remained in second-line service for decades.\n\nIt is still used as a ceremonial firearm today. The SKS was widely exported, and was also licensed for production by then [[Eastern Bloc]] nations Romania and East Germany, as well as China, where it was designated the \"Type 56 Carbine\". The [[East German]] version was known as the '''''Karabiner S''''', the Albanian as the Model 561, and [[North Korea]]n as the \"Type 63\". The SKS is popular on the civilian surplus market as a hunting and marksmanship semi-automatic rifle in many countries, including the United States and Canada. Its age and numbers make it relatively inexpensive to purchase, and steel cased 7.62\u00d739mm ammunition is one of the least expensive center fire cartridges currently on the market.\n\n== Design ==\n[[File:SKS Ladestreifen.jpg|thumb|left|The SKS can be quickly reloaded using disposable 10-round stripper clips. Note that the safety is in the fire position]]\n[[File:SKS magazine.JPG|thumb|left|SKS with the magazine closed (top) and open.

It is a [[Gas-operated reloading|gas-operated]] rifle that has a spring-loaded [[Bolt (firearms)|bolt]] carrier and a [[Gas-operated reloading#Short-stroke piston|gas piston operating rod]] that work to unlock and cycle the action via gas pressure exerting pressure against them. The bolt is locked to contain the pressure of ignition at the moment of firing by tilting downwards at its rear and being held by a lug milled into the receiver.  At the moment of firing, the bolt carrier is pushed rearwards, which causes it to lift the bolt, unlocking it, and allowing it to be carried rearwards against a spring.  This allows the fired case to be ejected and a new round from the magazine to be carried into the chamber. The SKS represents an intermediate step in the process towards the development of true assault rifles,  being shorter and less powerful than the semi-automatic rifles that preceded it, such as the Soviet [[SVT-40]], but being longer (10&nbsp;cm or 4in) than AK-series rifles which replaced it.  As a result, it has a slightly higher muzzle velocity than those arms that replaced it.\n\nThe SKS's ten-round internal [[box magazine]] can be loaded either by hand or from a [[stripper clip]]. Cartridges stored in the magazine can be removed by pulling back on a latch located forward of the trigger guard (thus opening the \"floor\" of the magazine and allowing the rounds to fall out).<ref name=\"pdf.textfiles\">http://pdf.textfiles.com/manuals/MILITARY/united_states_army_tc_9-56%20-%201_october_1969.pdf {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121224023008/http://pdf.textfiles.com/manuals/MILITARY/united_states_army_tc_9-56%20-%201_october_1969.pdf |date=2012-12-24 }} | TC 9\u201356, Department of the Army Training Circular, SKS RIFLE, Simonov Type 56, Headquarters, Department of the Army, October 1969</ref> In typical military use the stripper clips are disposable. If necessary they can be reloaded multiple times and reused.\n\nWhile early (1949\u201350) Soviet models had spring-loaded firing pins, which held the pin away from cartridge primers until struck by the action's hammer, most variants of the SKS have a free floating firing pin within the bolt. Because of this design, care must be taken during cleaning (especially after long storage packed in Cosmoline) to ensure that the firing pin can freely move and does not stick in the forward position within the bolt. SKS firing pins that are stuck in the forward position have been known to cause accidental \"slamfires\" (the rifle firing on its own, without pulling the trigger and often without being fully locked). This behavior is less likely with the hard primer military-spec ammo for which the SKS was designed, but as with any rifle, users should properly maintain their firearms. For collectors, slamfires are more likely when the bolt still has remnants of [[Cosmoline]] embedded in it that retards firing pin movement. As it is triangular in cross section with only one way to properly insert it (notches up), slamfires can also result if the firing pin is inserted in one of the other two orientations.\n\nIn most variants (Yugoslav models being the most notable exception), the barrel is chrome-lined for increased wear and heat tolerance from sustained fire and to resist corrosion from chlorate-primed corrosive ammunition, as well as to facilitate cleaning. Chrome bore lining is common in military rifles. Although it can diminish accuracy, its effect on practical accuracy in a rifle of this type is limited.\n\nThe front sight has a hooded post. The rear sight is an open notch type which is adjustable for elevation from {{convert|100|to|1000|m|yd}}. There is also an all-purpose \"battle\" setting on the sight ladder (marked \"\u041f\", for \"\u041f\u0440\u044f\u043c\u043e\u0439 \u0432\u044b\u0441\u0442\u0440\u0435\u043b\", meaning \"Straight shot\"), set for {{convert|300|m|yd|abbr=off}}. This is attained by moving the elevation slide to the rear of the ladder as far as it will go.<ref name=\"pdf.textfiles\" /><ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.pistolcraft.com/sks/ |title=SKS Instruction Manual<!-- Bot generated title --> |access-date=2012-04-25 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120411103553/http://www.pistolcraft.com/sks/ |archive-date=2012-04-11 |url-status=live }}</ref> The Yugoslav M59/66A1 has folddown luminous sights for use when firing under poor light conditions, while the older M59 and M59/66 do not.<ref name=\"pdf.textfiles\" />\n\nAll military SKSs have a [[bayonet]] attached to the underside of the barrel, which is extended and retracted via a spring-loaded hinge.

The Yugoslavian-made M59/66 and M59/66A1 variants are the only SKS models with an integral grenade launching attachment.<ref name=\"pdf.textfiles\" />\n\nThe SKS is easily field stripped and reassembled without specialized tools <!-- unfired cartidges are not needed for field stripping, the trigger group does not need to be removed to field strip the gun-->and the trigger group and magazine can be removed with an unfired cartridge, or with the receiver cover. The rifle has a cleaning kit stored in a trapdoor in the buttstock, with a cleaning rod running under the barrel, in the same style as the AK-47. The cap for the cleaning kit also serves as a cleaning rod guide, to protect the crown from being damaged during cleaning. The body of the cleaning kit serves as the cleaning rod handle. In common with some other Soviet-era designs, it trades some accuracy for ruggedness, reliability, ease of maintenance, ease of use, and low manufacturing cost.\n\n==History==\nDuring [[World War II]], many countries realized that existing rifles, such as the [[Mosin\u2013Nagant]], were too long and heavy and fired powerful cartridges that were effective in medium machine guns with a range in excess of {{convert|2000|m|yd}}, creating excessive recoil. These cartridges, such as the [[7.92\u00d757mm Mauser|8\u00d757mm Mauser]], [[.303 British]], [[.30-06 Springfield]], and [[7.62\u00d754mmR]] were effective in rifles to ranges of up to {{convert|1000|m|yd|abbr=off}}; however, it was noted that most firefights took place at maximum ranges of between {{convert|100|and|300|m|yd|abbr=off}}. Only a highly trained specialist, such as a [[sniper]], could employ the full-power rifle cartridge to its true potential. Both the Soviet Union and Germany realized this and designed new firearms for smaller, intermediate-power cartridges. The U.S. fielded an intermediate round in the .30 (7.62 [[millimetre|mm]]) U.S., now known as the [[.30 Carbine]]; used in the [[M1 carbine]], it was widely used by American forces in WWII but was much weaker than German and Soviet intermediate rounds, and was never intended to replace the .30-06 rifle cartridge.\n\nThe German approach was the production of a series of intermediate cartridges and rifles in the interwar period, eventually developing the ''Maschinenkarabiner'', or machine-carbine, which later evolved into the  [[StG 44|Sturmgewehr 44]], which was produced in large numbers during the war, and chambered in the [[7.92\u00d733mm Kurz]] intermediate round.\n\nThe Soviet Union type qualified a new intermediate round in 1943, at the same time it began to field the [[Mosin\u2013Nagant]] M44 carbine as a general issue small arm. However, the M44, which had a side-folding bayonet and shorter overall length, still fired the full-powered round of its predecessors. A small number of SKS rifles were tested on the front line in early 1945 against the Germans in World War II.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://modernfirearms.net/en/military-rifles/self-loading-rifles/russia-self-loading-rifles/simonov-sks-eng/ |title=SKS Simonov -- Modern Firearms |publisher=Modernfirearms.net |date= |access-date=2018-02-09 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180215052642/http://modernfirearms.net/en/military-rifles/self-loading-rifles/russia-self-loading-rifles/simonov-sks-eng/ |archive-date=2018-02-15 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\nDesign-wise, the SKS relies on the [[AVS-36]] (developed by the same designer, Simonov) to a point that some consider it a shortened AVS-36, stripped of select-fire capability and re-chambered for the 7.62\u00d739mm cartridge.<ref>Vadim Ribakov, [https://web.archive.org/web/20040614201935/http://www.sksboards.com/sksinfo/SARSKS.html OP-SKS: Hunting Carbine], ''Small Arms Review'', Vol. 4 No. 8, May, 2001</ref> This viewpoint is problematic, as the AVS uses a sliding block bolt locking device, while the SKS employs a more reliable tilting-bolt design inherited from the [[PTRS-41]], which it it's self took from [[SVT-40]]. The bolt mechanism is one of the defining features of a rifle, having a different bolt means the SKS and AVS merely appear similar in layout, while differing vastly in bolt lockup, caliber, size, and that one has a fixed magazine and the other has a detachable magazine. It also owes a debt to the M44, incorporating the carbine size and integral bayonet.\n\nIn 1949, the SKS was officially adopted into the [[Soviet Army]], manufactured at the [[Tula Arms Plant|Tula Armory]] from 1949 until 1955 and the [[Izhevsk Mechanical Plant]] in 1953 and 1954. Although the quality of Soviet carbines manufactured at these state-run arsenals was quite high, its design was already obsolete compared to the Kalashnikov which was [[Selective fire|selective-fire]], lighter, had three times the magazine capacity, and had the potential to be less labor-intensive to manufacture. Gradually over the next few years, AK-47 production increased until the extant SKS carbines in service were relegated primarily to non-infantry and to second-line troops. They remained in service in this fashion even as late as the 1980s, and possibly the early 1990s. To this day, the SKS carbine is used by some ceremonial Russian [[honor guard]]s, much the same way the [[M14 Rifle]] is within the United States; it is far less ubiquitous than the AK-47 but both original Soviet SKS rifles and copies can still be found today in civilian hands as well as in the hands of third-world militias and insurgent groups.\n\nThe SKS was to be a gap-filling firearm manufactured using the proven operating mechanism design of the [[14.5\u00d7114mm]] PTRS-41 [[anti-tank rifle]] and using proven milled forging manufacturing techniques. This was to provide a fallback for the radically new and experimental design of the AK-47, in the event that the AK proved to be a failure. In fact, the original [[Stamping (metalworking)|stamped]] receiver AK-47 had to be quickly redesigned to use a milled receiver which delayed production, and extended the SKS carbine's service life.\n\n==Service==\n[[File:Vietcong1968.jpg|right|thumb|upright| A guerilla of the [[People's Liberation Armed Forces of South Vietnam]], crouching in a tunnel, holding an SKS carbine.]]\n\nAlmost as soon as the SKS was brought into service in 1949, it was rendered obsolete for Soviet purposes by the new AK-47, which was adopted by the Soviet military later that year. However, it found a long second life in the service of other Soviet-aligned countries, in particular the Chinese army, who found it well suited to their own style of warfare, the \"People's War\" whose main actors were highly mobile, self-reliant guerrilla bands and rural militias protecting their own villages. In the philosophy of \"the People's War\", the emphasis was on long-range sniping, spoiling attacks, and ambushes. For this the Chinese army preferred its own domestic version of the SKS (the Type 56 carbine) to the AK pattern.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://baike.baidu.com/view/559379.htm|title=56\u5f0f\u534a\u81ea\u52a8\u6b65\u67aa _\u767e\u5ea6\u767e\u79d1|publisher=|access-date=26 November 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151019015401/http://baike.baidu.com/view/559379.htm|archive-date=19 October 2015|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nFrom its introduction in 1956, the Type 56/SKS remained the workhorse of the [[People's Liberation Army]] (PLA) for 30 years. In 1968, the army was briefly re-equipped with the unsuccessful [[Type 63 assault rifle]], which had been intended to combine the sustained firepower of China's first AK-47 variant (confusingly called the \"[[Type 56 assault rifle]]\") with the precise semi-automatic fire of the SKS/Type 56 carbine and replace both of those separate rifles. However, by the mid-1970s, all manner of problems were plaguing the unreliable Type 63 rifle. Troops clamored to be given back their carbines, which had been redistributed to local militia units, and the army staff abandoned the Type 63 and returned the Type 56 carbine (SKS) and Type 56 assault rifle (AK-47) back into service. The standard practice was for squad leaders and assistant squad leaders to carry an assault rifle and for most other soldiers to carry a carbine, so that a front-line infantry squad fielded two assault rifles, two light machine guns, and seven carbines.\n\nHowever, after the beginning of [[Sino-Vietnamese War|China's 1979 border war with Vietnam]], Chinese combat units found that the SKS carbine's capacity for long-range precision fire was of little use in the mountain jungles of the border region; as a result those units were hastily re-equipped with assault rifles. Rifles of the AK family (including both the Chinese army\u2019s Type 56 auto and the Vietnamese army\u2019s AK-47s and AKM) are for structural reasons relatively inaccurate,{{dubious|date=December 2018}} and because the Chinese army has historically favored precision fire (despite generally having firearms ill-suited to that task), the Sino-Vietnamese war directly hastened development of the PLA\u2019s [[Type 81 assault rifle]].{{citation needed|date=December 2018}} By the time border conflict broke out again between China and Vietnam in 1983, the Chinese military had already been completely re-equipped with their more accurate, precise Type 81 assault rifle.<ref>[[:zh:56\u5f0f\u534a\u81ea\u52a8\u6b65\u67aa]]</ref> However the Type 56 carbine still remains in service with Chinese militias and reserve forces. The Type 56 also is in front line use as a drill and ceremony rifle.\n\nMany surplus SKS rifles were disposed of in the 1990s, and photographs and stories exist of SKS rifles used by guerrilla fighters in [[Bosnia and Herzegovina|Bosnia]], [[Somalia]] and throughout Africa and Southeast Asia<ref>{{cite news | url=http://www.smh.com.au/articles/2003/01/24/1042911548582.html?oneclick=true | work=The Sydney Morning Herald | title=Refugees 'forced to become guerrillas' | date=January 25, 2003 | access-date=January 26, 2005 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070208210809/http://www.smh.com.au/articles/2003/01/24/1042911548582.html?oneclick=true | archive-date=February 8, 2007 | url-status=live }}</ref> during the 1990s and well into the 21st century. Several African, Asian, and Middle Eastern armies still use the SKS.\n\nDuring the [[Cold War]], the Soviet Union shared the SKS design and manufacturing details with its allies, and as a result, many variants of the SKS exist. Some variants use gas port controls, flip-up night sights, and prominent, muzzle-mounted grenade launchers (Yugoslav M59/66, possibly North Korean Type 63). In total, SKS rifles were manufactured by the Soviet Union, China, [[Yugoslavia]], Albania, [[North Korea]], [[North Vietnam]], [[East Germany]] (Kar. S) and (Model 56) in Romania. Physically, all are very similar, although the [[NATO]]-specification 22mm grenade launcher of the Yugoslav version, and the more encompassing stock of the Albanian version are visually distinctive. Many smaller parts, most notably the sights and charging handles, were unique to different national production runs. A small quantity of SKS carbines manufactured in 1955\u201356 was produced in China with Russian parts, presumably as part of a technology sharing arrangement. The vast majority of Yugoslav M59 and M59/66s have [[elm]], [[walnut]] and [[beech]] stocks. Russian SKS's had stocks of Arctic Birch (or \"Russian Birch\"), and the Chinese were of Catalpa wood (\"Chu wood\").<ref>{{cite web|url=http://yooperj.com/SKS-18.htm|title=Yooper John's SKS \u2013 Battle rifle of many nations|publisher=|date=|access-date=June 30, 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120108032414/http://yooperj.com/SKS-18.htm|archive-date=January 8, 2012|url-status=live}}</ref>  SKS carbines have also made appearances in recent conflicts in Africa, [[Afghanistan]], and [[Iraq]].

Spring-return firing pin was present on early models, and they did not have chrome bores (1949 \u2013 early 1951). The gas block had three changes: The first production stage gas block, used from 1949 through early 1950, was squared-off at a 90-degree angle. The second gas block production stage was instead cut at a 45-degree angle, seen on late 1950 to 1951 rifles. The third and final gas block stage, from 1952 through to 1956, was curved inward slightly toward the action.\n* '''Honor Guard''': All-chrome metal parts, with a lighter-colored wood stock.\n*'''OP-SKS'''.

The main reason for the manufacturing variance comes from differences between rifles made for the Chinese army and those made for export.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.milsurps.com/showthread.php?t=26665 |title=Chinese SKS Type 56 ID FAQ<!-- Bot generated title --> |access-date=2015-07-26 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151005074219/http://www.milsurps.com/showthread.php?t=26665 |archive-date=2015-10-05 |url-status=live }}</ref> The Chinese types typically have [[Chrome plating|chrome]]-lined barrels while the Yugoslav versions do not, resulting in some Yugoslavian carbines having bores in considerably worse condition than even the cheapest Chinese SKSs. The Yugo M59/66 rifles also are unique in having a gas shut off valve for grenade launching, which is a common source of malfunctions.  While often encountered in well-used condition, Romanian carbines were as well-built as the Soviet versions. In general, carbines made in the USSR are considered the highest quality.\n\nThe interchangeability of many parts has resulted in carbines on the U.S. market that are a mixture of different parts of varying quality, sometimes including parts from different countries, often with non-standard after-market parts. Such rifles are usually referred to as \"parts guns\" and are generally considered the least-desirable carbines encountered. Even so, they are significantly cheaper than comparable semi-automatic rifles and can be expected to offer reliable performance.\n\nNorth Korean, Vietnamese, East German, and Albanian SKSs bring a higher price than those of other countries. Soviet and Romanian carbines have largely reached price parity, with Chinese carbines somewhat lower in price. The stock on the Albanian versions is of a slightly different manufacture and these were made in low production numbers. There were approximately 18,000 Albanian SKSs manufactured during the late 1960s until 1978, and of those, approximately half were destroyed. Most of the remaining [[East Germany|East German]] SKSs had been sold/transferred to [[Croatia]] in the early 1990s.\n\n==Accuracy potential==\n{{Expand Russian|SKS|date=February 2016}}\n\nThe following table lists accuracy statistics for an SKS rifle firing 57-N-231 steel core service ammunition.  The statistics were computed under the Russian method for determining accuracy, which is more complex than Western methods which usually involve firing a group of shots and then measuring the overall diameter of the group.  The Russian method differs in that after a group of shots is fired into the target, two circles are drawn, one for the maximum vertical dispersion of hits and one for the maximum horizontal dispersion of hits.  Hits on the outer part of the target are disregarded, while only half of the hits on the inner part of the circles are counted (50% or R<sub>50</sub>), which significantly reduces the overall diameter of the groups.  The vertical and horizontal measurements of the reduced groups are then used to measure accuracy. This [[circular error probable]] method used by the Russian and other European militaries cannot be converted and is not comparable to US military methods for determining rifle accuracy. When the R<sub>50</sub> results are doubled the hit probability increases to 93.7%.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center;\"\n!colspan=\"5\"|SKS dispersion with 57-N-231 steel core service ammunition<ref name=\"\u043c\u0430\u043d\u0443\u0430\u043b\">Instruction on small business. 7.62mm SKS. 1962</ref><br />\n|-\n!Range||Vertical accuracy of fire (R<sub>50</sub>)||Horizontal accuracy of fire (R<sub>50</sub>)||Remaining bullet energy||Remaining bullet velocity\n|-\n|{{convert|0|m|yd|0|abbr=on}}||{{convert|0|cm|in|1|abbr=on}}||{{convert|0|cm|in|1|abbr=on}}||{{convert|2134|J|ftlbf|abbr=on}}||{{convert|735|m/s|ft/s|0|abbr=on}}\n|-\n|{{convert|100|m|yd|0|abbr=on}}||{{convert|3|cm|in|1|abbr=on}}||{{convert|2|cm|in|1|abbr=on}}||{{convert|1618|J|ftlbf|abbr=on}}||{{convert|640|m/s|ft/s|0|abbr=on}}\n|-\n|{{convert|200|m|yd|0|abbr=on}}||{{convert|6|cm|in|1|abbr=on}}||{{convert|4|cm|in|1|abbr=on}}||{{convert|1226|J|ftlbf|abbr=on}}||{{convert|557|m/s|ft/s|0|abbr=on}}\n|-\n|{{convert|300|m|yd|0|abbr=on}}||{{convert|9|cm|in|1|abbr=on}}||{{convert|7|cm|in|1|abbr=on}}||{{convert|932|J|ftlbf|abbr=on}}||{{convert|486|m/s|ft/s|0|abbr=on}}\n|-\n|{{convert|400|m|yd|0|abbr=on}}||{{convert|12|cm|in|1|abbr=on}}||{{convert|10|cm|in|1|abbr=on}}||{{convert|716|J|ftlbf|abbr=on}}||{{convert|426|m/s|ft/s|0|abbr=on}}\n|-\n|{{convert|500|m|yd|0|abbr=on}}||{{convert|17|cm|in|1|abbr=on}}||{{convert|14|cm|in|1|abbr=on}}||{{convert|559|J|ftlbf|abbr=on}}||{{convert|367|m/s|ft/s|0|abbr=on}}\n|-\n|{{convert|600|m|yd|0|abbr=on}}||{{convert|23|cm|in|1|abbr=on}}||{{convert|19|cm|in|1|abbr=on}}||{{convert|441|J|ftlbf|abbr=on}}||{{convert|334|m/s|ft/s|0|abbr=on}}\n|-\n|{{convert|700|m|yd|0|abbr=on}}||{{convert|30|cm|in|1|abbr=on}}||{{convert|24|cm|in|1|abbr=on}}||{{convert|353|J|ftlbf|abbr=on}}||{{convert|299|m/s|ft/s|0|abbr=on}}\n|-\n|{{convert|800|m|yd|0|abbr=on}}||{{convert|38|cm|in|1|abbr=on}}||{{convert|29|cm|in|1|abbr=on}}||{{convert|304|J|ftlbf|abbr=on}}||{{convert|277|m/s|ft/s|0|abbr=on}}\n|-\n|{{convert|900|m|yd|0|abbr=on}}||{{convert|47|cm|in|1|abbr=on}}||{{convert|34|cm|in|1|abbr=on}}||{{convert|265|J|ftlbf|abbr=on}}||{{convert|259|m/s|ft/s|0|abbr=on}}\n|-\n|{{convert|1000|m|yd|0|abbr=on}}||{{convert|57|cm|in|1|abbr=on}}||{{convert|40|cm|in|1|abbr=on}}||{{convert|235|J|ftlbf|abbr=on}}||{{convert|244|m/s|ft/s|0|abbr=on}}\n|}\n\n* <small>R<sub>50</sub> means the closest 50 percent of the shot group will all be within a circle of the mentioned diameter.</small>\n\nIn general, this is an improvement with respect to firing accuracy to the AK-47 and the AKM.

market, especially in Canada and the United States. Because of their historic and novel nature, Soviet and European SKS carbines are classified by the [[BATF]] as [[Collectors of Curio and Relic Firearms|\"Curio & Relic\"]] items under U.S. law, allowing them to be sold with features that might otherwise be restricted. Chinese manufactured rifles, even the rare early \"Sino-Soviet\" examples, are not so classified, though the \"Sino-Soviet\" rifles qualify for automatic Curio & Relic status due to being manufactured over 50 years ago. Because of the massive size of the Chinese [[People's Liberation Army]], over 8 million Chinese SKS rifles were manufactured during their 20 years of use making the Chinese SKS one of the most mass-produced military rifles of all time although still far behind its successor the [[AK-47]].\n\nIn Canada, the large flux of imported SKS rifles has driven prices down to around $200\u2013$300 per Russian SKS. The Chinese Norinco SKS can be bought for slightly less. As with most military surplus rifles, they are coated in [[cosmoline]] for the preservation of the firearm while under storage for decades at a time. Along with a large supply of bulk 7.62\u00d739mm surplus ammunition, SKS rifles have become a popular firearm for civilian ownership.\n\nIn Australia, SKS rifles were very popular with recreational hunters and target shooters during the 1980s and early 1990s before [[Military-Style Semi-Automatic|semi-automatic rifles]] were [[Gun politics in Australia|restricted from legal ownership in 1996]]. Since the introduction of the 1996 gun restrictions in Australia, the [[Mosin\u2013Nagant]] series of bolt-action rifles and carbines have now filled the void created when the SKS was restricted from legal ownership.\n[[File:SKS modified.jpg|thumb|A [[sporterized]] SKS carbine fitted with an aftermarket composite stock and weaver rail.]]\nIn the early 1990s, the Chinese SKS rapidly became the \"poor man's deer rifle\" in the United States due to its low price, lower even than such old favorites in that role as the [[Marlin Model 336|Marlin 336]]. Importation of the Chinese SKS into the U.S.A. was banned in the [[Federal_Assault_Weapons_Ban|Federal Assault Weapons Ban]] of 1994.\n\nDue to its relatively low cost and widespread availability and usage, the SKS has spawned a growing market for both replacement parts and accessories. Many aftermarket parts are available to modify the carbine\u2014sometimes so considerably that it bears little resemblance to the original firearm. This may include items such as synthetic [[gun stock|stocks]], pistol grips, higher capacity [[Magazine (firearms)|magazine]]s, replacement [[receiver (firearms)|receiver]] covers (to allow the mounting of [[Telescopic sight|scopes]], [[laser]]s, etc.), different [[muzzle brake]]s, recoil buffers, bipods, and more.\n\n==Legal issues==\nThe carbine's integral 10-round magazine is not an issue in those states and nations which prohibit higher-capacity magazines, except Canada.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cfc-cafc.gc.ca/faq/default_e.asp#a6|title=Canada firearm regulations pertaining to magazine capacity|publisher=|access-date=26 November 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070730232453/http://www.cfc-cafc.gc.ca/faq/default_e.asp#a6|archive-date=30 July 2007|url-status=live}}</ref> In the case for Canada, the SKS is classified as a non-restricted firearm and the magazine must be pinned to five rounds or the rifles must be retrofitted with five-shot magazines.  However, although the 7.62\u00d739mm round is generally compared to the American Winchester [[.30-30]], many states have laws against hunting rifles with magazines of more than five rounds. Magazine plugs limiting the magazine to five rounds must be used for hunting in these states.\n\nWhile aftermarket detachable magazines may be simple to install, doing so may be illegal under certain circumstances or even in some vicinities. They are also banned in [[Cook County, Illinois|Cook County]], [[Illinois]], which includes [[Chicago]] and many suburbs, although as of the 2010 [[McDonald v. Chicago]] US Supreme Court decision, the City of Chicago ordinance allows removable magazines, creating a confusing situation for firearm owners.\n\n[[United States Code|U.S.C.]] [[U.S.C. 922(r)|922 (r)]], which regulates imported rifles with certain features the [[BATFE]] defines as not being suitable for sporting purposes requires ten \"compliance parts\" (out of a list of 20 possible parts) of U.S. manufacture to be installed on any modified SKS.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Saiga semi-automatic rifle]]\n* [[Ruger Mini-30]]\n* [[WASR series rifles]]\n* [[CZ 527]]\n* [[AK-47]]\n* [[AKM]]\n* [[AK-103]]\n* [[TKB-517]]\n* [[vz. 52 rifle]]\n* [[vz. 58]]\n* [[FN Model 1949]]\n* [[Table of handgun and rifle cartridges]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|colwidth=30em}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Commons category}}\n*[https://www.marstar.ca/html/reflibrary/Manuals/sks.html Soviet SKS Operation Manual from 1974]\n* {{Internet Archive short film|id=gov.dod.dimoc.26977|name=STAFF FILM REPORT 66-25A (1966)}} {{in lang|it}}\n*[http://www.armimilitari.it/wordpress/1321/simonov-sks/ Simonov SKS (CKC45g)]\n*[https://www.rockislandauction.com/blog/why-do-people-like-sks-rifles/ Why is the SKS Rifle Popular?]\n\n{{Soviet infantry weapons of World War II}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Sks}}\n[[Category:7.62\u00d739mm semi-automatic rifles]]\n[[Category:Semi-automatic rifles of the Soviet Union]]\n[[Category:Carbines]]\n[[Category:Short stroke piston firearms]]\n[[Category:World War II infantry weapons of the Soviet Union]]\n[[Category:Rifles of the Cold War]]\n[[Category:Cold War weapons of the Soviet Union]]\n[[Category:Infantry weapons of the Cold War]]\n[[Category:Tula Arms Plant products]]\n", "name_user": "Artoria2e5", "label": "safe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SKS"}

To some extent, it has persisted to this day in such phenomena as the ''[[Carlebach minyan]]'' and the [[Breslov_(Hasidic_group)#Today|growth in the Breslov movement]].\n\n==Early 20th century==\n[[Martin Buber]] helped initiate interest in Hasidism among modernized Jews through a series of books he wrote in the first decades of the 20th century, such as ''Tales of the Hasidic Masters'' and the ''Legend of the Baal Shem Tov''. In these books, Buber focused on the role of story telling and the charisma of early Hasidic masters as a vehicle for personal spirituality. As such, these books represent one aspect of Buber's larger project of creating a new form of personalistic, [[Existentialism|existential]] religiosity. Buber came under considerable criticism, especially from younger contemporary [[Gershom Scholem]], for having interpreted Hasidism in an eccentric way that misrepresented Hasidic belief and literature. Nevertheless, Buber's sympathetic treatment of Hasidism proved attractive to many and started the 20th century romance between (idealized) Hasidism and non-Orthodox Jews.\n\n==Post-World War II==\n{{Jewish mysticism}}\nFollowing [[World War II]], when the Hasidic centers of [[Central Europe|Central]] and Eastern Europe were decimated, some of the surviving communities relocated to America, creating new opportunities for [[the USA|America]]n Jews to have direct experience with them, their practices and their beliefs. Most of these communities remained determinedly insular, but a few, primarily the [[Chabad-Lubavitch|Chabad]] and [[Bratslav]] (or Breslov) Hasidim, adopted an attitude of outreach to the larger Jewish community, seeking to win more Jews to the Hasidic way of life. \n\nIn the 1960s the [[Lubavitcher]] [[Rebbe]] ([[Menachem Mendel Shneerson]]) started commissioning young Chabadniks to seek out and teach young secular and religiously liberal Jews. Two of the early \"shluchim\" were [[Zalman Schachter-Shalomi]] and [[Shlomo Carlebach (musician)|Shlomo Carlebach]]. While Carlebach, a charismatic singer who used music as his tool, stayed (largely) within the circle of the Orthodox community from which he arose, Schachter-Shalomi charted an increasingly independent course, leaving Chabad to eventually study at [[Hebrew Union College (HUC)]], the leading academic institution of [[Reform Judaism]], and to found what became [[Jewish Renewal]].\n\nEqually important was [[Abraham Joshua Heschel]], a [[Holocaust]] refugee and scion of Hasidic royalty, who began his academic career in America with a life-saving but difficult wartime stint at HUC. In 1946, he moved to the [[Jewish Theological Seminary of America]], the intellectual center for [[Conservative Judaism]]. There he still found himself marginalized for his Hasidic interests and customs, yet he surrounded himself with a small circle of devoted students (and eventual congregational [[rabbis]]) drawn to his mystically flavored phenomenology. As the 1960s began, Heschel was achieving increasing recognition as a theologian of stature with the publication of his books ''[[God in Search of Man]]'' and ''The Prophets.'' With that fame came an interest in his Hasidic roots and their role in his teachings. His social activism in the 1960s and 1970s further endeared him to many young Jews.\n\n==1960s and 1970s==\nSeveral of Heschel's students at JTS during the turbulent 1960s and early 1970s eventually became involved in the embryonic [[Chavurah|Havurah]] movement, a loosely defined project of creating an alternative, informal type of Jewish community first proposed by Reform theologian Jakob Petuchowski in the 1960s. While the movement spanned a broad spectrum of spiritual proclivities, some Jews in the founding circles, like [[Arthur Waskow]], [[Arthur Green]], and [[Michael Lerner (rabbi)|Michael Lerner]], under the combined influence of Heschel and Schachter-Shalomi, took up the project of further exploring Hasidism and recasting it in an American idiom. [[Havurat Shalom]], the flagship of this experimental quasi-communal movement which was started jointly by Green and Schachter-Shalomi in Boston, produced the greatest artifact of Havurah Judaism, the ''[[Jewish Catalog]]'' series, a set of three books devoted to \"do-it-yourself\" Judaism, written with a healthy dose of information and enthusiasm for things Hasidic. In general, the Havurah communities most influenced by Hasidism were also influenced by Kabbalah, and it remains the case that these interests overlap in most of what can be labeled neo-Hasidic.\n\nThese future \"Neo-Hasids\" focused on selected attractive aspects of traditional Hasidism while rejecting those Hasidic teachings they found incompatible with their modern egalitarian commitments, such as Hasidism's attitudes toward women, sexuality, and non-Jews. A few of these devotees, like Waskow and Lerner, became writers of note and \"public square\" intellectuals in the Jewish community and in the [[Jewish Renewal]] movement. Others, such as Green and Lawrence Fine, became leading scholars in the Jewish academic world, bringing an appreciation of Hasidism and an interest in adapting its ideas and customs to contemporary mores and life. Through books like ''Tormented Master,'' ''The Language of Truth'' and ''Your Word Is Fire,'' Green (and others) made Hasidism both more accessible and compelling for Jews seeking personal spirituality amidst the outwardly focused and sometimes spiritually dry world of the formal American Jewish community. Among the liberal movements, the Reform community remained resistant to this trend for a longer period, but a few rabbis, such as [[Herbert Weiner]] and [[Lawrence Kushner]], also started \"translating\" Hasidism into a Reform idiom, expanding its influence.\n\nThis overlapping of amorphous interest in Hasidism among academics, seekers, religious functionaries, intellectuals, \"alternative\" rabbis and teachers, has led to the coining of the term \"Neo-Hasidism (NH).\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.thelehrhaus.com/jewish-thought-history/the-development-of-neo-hasidism-echoes-and-repercussions-part-i-introduction-hillel-zeitlin-and-martin-buber/|title=The Development of Neo-Hasidism: Echoes and Repercussions Part I: Introduction, Hillel Zeitlin, and Martin Buber|last=Mayse|first=Ariel Evan|date=19 December 2018|website=The Lehrhaus|access-date=16 September 2019}}</ref>\n\nA few formalized groups and institutions, such as P'nai Or congregation in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania and Elat Chayyim Retreat Center in Falls Village, CT, are heavily influenced by NH.
