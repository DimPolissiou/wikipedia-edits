The sequel is set to premiere in 2020.\n\n== Synopsis ==\nPawaret \"Pang\" Sermrittirong ([[Korapat Kirdpan]]) is a struggling, ordinary 10th grade student in Ritdha High School. Here, a classification system is strictly implemented wherein students are divided into classes based on academic excellence. Pang is in Class VIII, the lowest level, and has no hopes of rising up the hierarchy.\n\nBut everything turns haywire for Pang when he unexpectedly passes the school's Placement Exam, which gives low-class students a chance to step up in their game. Adding to the mystery, he is [[Academic acceleration|accelerated]] to the \"Gifted Program,\" the highest and most special class in school where only a handful of students are accepted. As he goes through their first sessions, Pang starts to feel something strange about the Gifted Program. Soon, he and his Gifted classmates unleash their long-hidden potentials: [[supernatural]] and [[superhuman]] abilities that stem from their [[Personality|personalities]] and [[behavior]].\n\nWhat lies ahead of Pang and his fellow Gifted is a thrilling journey of developing their potentials, discovering the horrible secret behind the Program, and breaking down the system that has been torturing students for generations.\n\n==Cast and characters==\n=== Main ===\n* [[Korapat Kirdpan]] as Pawaret \"Pang\" Sermrittirong\n: Head Student of Ritdha High School's Gifted Program; the drama's main [[protagonist]]. Pang was once a struggling student from Class VIII who is soon to be [[Academic acceleration|accelerated]] to the Gifted Program through the school's Placement Exam. Through the Gifted Program, he discovers he has the power of [[Brainwashing|mind control]], in which he can compel someone do whatever he wishes through physical contact with the subject and feeling their [[Cardiac cycle|heartbeat]]. He becomes the Gifted Program's Head Student when Director Chueamanee removed Wave from the position after the class' midterm exams. He is close with fellow Gifted students Namtaan and Ohm.\n* [[Wachirawit Ruangwiwat]] as Wasuthorn \"Wave\" Worachotmethee\n: A student of Ritdha High School's Gifted Program. Through the Program, Wave discovers his power of technopathy, the ability to control and manipulate electronic machines through contact, a gift associated with his advanced skills in [[mathematics]], [[Computer|computers]], and [[Computer programming|programming]]. He was the Program's Head Student upon Punn's resignation but was ousted by Director Chueamanee after their midterms. He is apparently rude and arrogant, and hates when other students seem to overshadow him. His over-competitiveness was triggered by his bad relationship with his former teacher and crush Ms. Nara, who stole his thesis and framed him of [[plagiarism]].\n* Apichaya Thongkham as Chayanit \"Namtaan\" Prachkarit\n: A student of Ritdha High School's Gifted Program. Namtaan discovers her power of [[Psychometry (paranormal)|psychometry]], the ability to see or hear associated events on an object through contact, a gift associated on her character of being nosy. Namtaan has [[Essential hypertension|primary hypertension]] which limits her in using her psychometry in its full extent. She is close to Pang and Ohm.\n* Harit Cheewagaroon as Wichai \"Ohm\" Sai-Ngern\n: A student of Ritdha High School's Gifted Program. Ohm has a form of [[psychokinesis]] which enables him to make objects (including humans) disappear and bringing them back again by will, which soon evolves to include [[invisibility]] and [[teleportation]] (of himself and other humans). This power is associated with his character of being forgetful and losing things most of the time. When using his power, Ohm experiences [[Nosebleed|nosebleeds]] which indicate that his power has manifested. He is close to Pang and Namtaan, and is known for being the lively one in the Gifted class.\n* Ramida Jiranorraphat as Irin \"Claire\" Jaratpun\n: A student of Ritdha High School's Gifted Program and member of the Drama Club. Claire has a form of [[synesthesia]] which enables him to see a person's [[Aura (paranormal)|aura]] and associate the color of the aura with a certain kind of emotion (e.g. blue for [[sadness]], red for [[anger]], pink for [[love]], etc). Her power is associated with her passion for [[acting]]. She is Punn's love interest and Korn's childhood friend.\n* Atthaphan Phunsawat as Punn Taweesilp\n: A student of Ritdha High School's Gifted Program. Punn has the power of imitation and ability mastering, which enables him to perfectly copy a skill by watching or studying but causes him to develop [[Dissociative identity disorder|multiple personalities]] (his normal self, the leader, the paranoid, the belligerent, and the suicidal). His power is associated with his [[Perfectionism (psychology)|perfectionism]], being an academic achiever and his eagerness to learn different things. He was elected as Head Student of the Gifted class until his resignation. He is Claire's love interest.\n* Pattadon Janngeon as  Thanakorn \"Korn\" Gorbgoon\n: A student of Ritdha High School's Gifted Program. Korn has the ability to remain [[Wakefulness|awake]] for days without getting sleepy. He has a crush on his childhood friend Claire, until Claire rejected his love. His passion for [[photography]] leads him to intimately associating with Koi who, unbeknowst to him, is acting upon orders from Mrs. Ladda to gather information about the Gifted Program.\n* Napasorn Weerayuttvilai as Patchamon \"Mon\" Pitiwongkorn\n: A student of Ritdha High School's Gifted Program and member of the Martial Arts Club. Mon possesses superhuman strength with enhanced agility, dexterity and coordination that is useful for combat. Her potential is associated with her passion for sports. However, her body produces [[pheromones]] that are excreted through her sweat and tears. Once exposed to it, a person would turn insane, violent and, worse, murderous. She is Art's love interest.\n* Chatchawit Techarukpong as Porama \"Pom\" Wongrattana\n: The class adviser of Ritdha High School's Gifted Program. Mr. Pom belongs to Ritdha High School's Gifted Program Batch 3, and decided to work as a teacher in Ritdha after graduating. He has the power of memory manipulation which enables him to erase [[Memory|memories]], first, by putting the subject in [[hypnosis]] using sound with a regular tempo (through a [[metronome]]) and snapping his fingers, and second, by touching the subject's head while it is in hypnotic state. He is also able to both erase and restore his own memories. His power is associated with his ability to memorize many details. As the teacher, his power is taken into advantage by Director Chueamanee in erasing the memories of students who are involved in incidents related to the Gifted Program.\n* Chayapol Jutamat as Chanuj \"Jack\" Saeliu, and Chayakorn Jutamat as Chanet \"Jo\" Saeliu\n: The [[Twin|identical twin]] students of Ritdha High School's Gifted Program. Jack and Jo have the ability to respond to stimuli in sync.\n* [[Katreeya English]] as  Ladda Ngamkul\n: Head administrator of Ritdha High School. Mrs. Ladda is the school disciplinarian  and is primarily viewed as a terrible person by the students due to her strict and serious enforcement of punishments.\n* Wanchana Sawasdee as Supot Chueamanee\n: The Director of Ritdha High School and master of the Gifted Program; the drama's main [[antagonist]]. Director Chueamanee designed the Gifted Program to search for and train young people who had evolved to develop supernatural or superhuman abilities. He strongly believes in a society where the strong leads the weaker or inferior ones, as reflected in the school's student hierarchy system, his abusive treatment of low-class students, and his bias towards the Gifted. He has the same, but stronger and evolved, mind control power as Pang. Since he and Pang have the same power, they cannot use their powers against each other.\n\n=== Supporting ===\n{{colbegin}}\n* Wanwimol Jaenasavamethee as  Rawin \"Koi\" Boonrak\n: A Class III student and videographer of the Journalism Club.

The sequel is set to premiere in 2020.\n\n== Synopsis ==\nPawaret \"Pang\" Sermrittirong ([[Korapat Kirdpan]]) is a struggling, ordinary 10th grade student in Ritdha High School. Here, a classification system is strictly implemented wherein students are divided into classes based on academic excellence. Pang is in Class VIII, the lowest level, and has no hopes of rising up the hierarchy.\n\nBut everything turns haywire for Pang when he unexpectedly passes the school's Placement Exam, which gives low-class students a chance to step up in their game. Adding to the mystery, he is [[Academic acceleration|accelerated]] to the \"Gifted Program,\" the highest and most special class in school where only a handful of students are accepted. As he goes through their first sessions, Pang starts to feel something strange about the Gifted Program. Soon, he and his Gifted classmates unleash their long-hidden potentials: [[supernatural]] and [[superhuman]] abilities that stem from their [[Personality|personalities]] and [[behavior]].\n\nWhat lies ahead of Pang and his fellow Gifted is a thrilling journey of developing their potentials, discovering the horrible secret behind the Program, and breaking down the system that has been torturing students for generations.\n\n==Cast and characters==\n=== Main ===\n* [[Korapat Kirdpan]] as Pawaret \"Pang\" Sermrittirong\n: Head Student of Ritdha High School's Gifted Program; the drama's main [[protagonist]]. Pang was once a struggling student from Class VIII who is soon to be [[Academic acceleration|accelerated]] to the Gifted Program through the school's Placement Exam. Through the Gifted Program, he discovers he has the power of [[Brainwashing|mind control]], in which he can compel someone do whatever he wishes through physical contact with the subject and feeling their [[Cardiac cycle|heartbeat]]. He becomes the Gifted Program's Head Student when Director Chueamanee removed Wave from the position after the class' midterm exams. He is close with fellow Gifted students Namtaan and Ohm.\n* [[Wachirawit Ruangwiwat]] as Wasuthorn \"Wave\" Worachotmethee\n: A student of Ritdha High School's Gifted Program. Through the Program, Wave discovers his power of technopathy, the ability to control and manipulate electronic machines through contact, a gift associated with his advanced skills in [[mathematics]], [[Computer|computers]], and [[Computer programming|programming]]. He was the Program's Head Student upon Punn's resignation but was ousted by Director Chueamanee after their midterms. He is apparently rude and arrogant, and hates when other students seem to overshadow him. His over-competitiveness was triggered by his bad relationship with his former teacher and crush Nara, who stole his thesis and framed him of [[plagiarism]].\n* Apichaya Thongkham as Chayanit \"Namtaan\" Prachkarit\n: A student of Ritdha High School's Gifted Program. Namtaan discovers her power of [[Psychometry (paranormal)|psychometry]], the ability to see or hear associated events on an object through contact, a gift associated on her character of being nosy.

She is close to Pang and Ohm.\n* Harit Cheewagaroon as Wichai \"Ohm\" Sai-Ngern\n: A student of Ritdha High School's Gifted Program. Ohm has a form of [[psychokinesis]] which enables him to make objects (including humans) disappear and bringing them back again by will, which soon evolves to include [[invisibility]] and [[teleportation]] (of himself and other humans). This power is associated with his character of being forgetful and losing things most of the time. When using his power, Ohm experiences [[Nosebleed|nosebleeds]] which indicate that his power has manifested. He is close to Pang and Namtaan, and is known for being the lively one in the Gifted class.\n* Ramida Jiranorraphat as Irin \"Claire\" Jaratpun\n: A student of Ritdha High School's Gifted Program and member of the Drama Club. Claire has a form of [[synesthesia]] which enables him to see a person's [[Aura (paranormal)|aura]] and associate the color of the aura with a certain kind of emotion (e.g. blue for [[sadness]], red for [[anger]], pink for [[love]], etc). Her power is associated with her passion for [[acting]]. She is Punn's love interest and Korn's childhood friend.\n* Atthaphan Phunsawat as Punn Taweesilp\n: A student of Ritdha High School's Gifted Program. Punn has the power of imitation and ability mastering, which enables him to perfectly copy a skill by watching or studying but causes him to develop [[Dissociative identity disorder|multiple personalities]] (his normal self, the leader, the paranoid, the belligerent, and the suicidal). His power is associated with his [[Perfectionism (psychology)|perfectionism]], being an academic achiever and his eagerness to learn different things. He was elected as Head Student of the Gifted class until his resignation. He is Claire's love interest.\n* Pattadon Janngeon as  Thanakorn \"Korn\" Gorbgoon\n: A student of Ritdha High School's Gifted Program. Korn has the ability to remain [[Wakefulness|awake]] for days without getting sleepy. He has a crush on his childhood friend Claire, until Claire rejected his love.

Mon possesses superhuman strength with enhanced agility, dexterity and coordination that is useful for combat. Her potential is associated with her passion for sports. However, her body produces [[pheromones]] that are excreted through her sweat and tears. Once exposed to it, a person would turn insane, violent and, worse, murderous. She is Art's love interest.\n* Chatchawit Techarukpong as Porama \"Pom\" Wongrattana\n: The class adviser of Ritdha High School's Gifted Program. Mr. Pom belongs to Ritdha High School's Gifted Program Batch 3, and decided to work as a teacher in Ritdha after graduating. He has the power of memory manipulation which enables him to erase [[Memory|memories]], first, by putting the subject in [[hypnosis]] using sound with a regular tempo (through a [[metronome]]) and snapping his fingers, and second, by touching the subject's head while it is in hypnotic state. He is also able to both erase and restore his own memories. His power is associated with his ability to memorize many details. As the teacher, his power is taken into advantage by Director Chueamanee in erasing the memories of students who are involved in incidents related to the Gifted Program.\n* Chayapol Jutamat as Chanuj \"Jack\" Saeliu, and Chayakorn Jutamat as Chanet \"Jo\" Saeliu\n: The [[Twin|identical twin]] students of Ritdha High School's Gifted Program.

Director Chueamanee designed the Gifted Program to search for and train young people who had evolved to develop supernatural or superhuman abilities. He strongly believes in a society where the strong leads the weaker or inferior ones, as reflected in the school's student hierarchy system, his abusive treatment of low-class students, and his bias towards the Gifted.

She was captured by Spanish [[Ferdinand VII of Spain|Royalist]]s and ultimately executed for [[high treason]]. The Day of the Colombian Woman is commemorated on the anniversary of her death. She is now considered a [[heroine]] of the independence of [[Colombia]].\n\n== Name ==\nBecause her [[birth certificate]] was never found, her legal [[given name]] is unknown. The name Salavarrieta is known only by the names her family and friends used. Her father referred to her as Apolonia in his [[will (law)|will]], which Salvador Contreras, the [[priest]] who formalized the testament on 13 December 1802, confirmed.<ref>Will of Joaquin Salavarrieta, to Doctor D. Salvador Contreras,  Protocol of the 3rd Notary of Bogot\u00e1, scrivener Pedro Joaqu\u00edn Maldonado, 1802, \u201cArchivo General de la Naci\u00f3n\u201d, folders 229v. to 231v and 289r to 291v.</ref> She was closest to her brother, Viviano, as she became his de facto guardian when her parents died. When the armed forces in Guaduas started looking for her, she began calling herself Policarpa.\n\nIn her 1817 forged [[passport]], used to get in and out of [[Bogot\u00e1]] during the [[Reconquista (Spanish America)|Reconquista]], she appeared as \"Gregoria Apolinaria.\" [[Andrea Ricaurte de Lozano]], whom Policarpa lived with, and officially worked for in [[Bogot\u00e1]], as well as Ambrosio Almeyda, a [[guerrilla]] leader to whom she supplied information, also called her by that name. Her contemporaries referred to her simply as \"La Pola,\" but Policarpa Salavarrieta is the name by which she is remembered and commemorated.\n\n== Place and date of birth ==\nLa Pola's [[date of birth|date]] and [[birthplace|place of birth]] are also subject to conjecture in the absence of legal documents. The popular version is that she was born in the [[municipalities of Colombia|municipality]] of [[Guaduas]], [[Cundinamarca State|Cundinamarca]], between 1790 and 1796. However [[Rafael Pombo]] affirmed that she had been born in [[Mariquita, Tolima|Mariquita]], while [[Jos\u00e9 Caicedo Rojas]] confirmed it as [[Bogot\u00e1]].\n\nHer date and place of birth can be surmised from information available about her siblings which, curiously enough, were not lost.\n\nHer siblings were:\n\n*Mar\u00eda Ignacia Clara, born in the San Miguel parish of Guaduas August 12, 1789 \u2013 1802\n*Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda de los \u00c1ngeles, [[baptised]] in Guaduas on August 12, 1790 - became an [[Augustinian]] [[friar]]\n*Catarina, born in Guaduas, 1791\n*Eduardo, born in Guaduas on November 3, 1792 \u2013 1802\n*Manuel, born in Guaduas on May 26, 1796 - also became an [[Augustinian]] [[friar]]\n*Francisco Antonio, baptised in the Santa B\u00e1rbara parish, [[Bogot\u00e1]], 26 September 1798\n*Ram\u00f3n, [[Confirmation|confirmed]] in Bogot\u00e1 in 1800\n*Bibiano, baptised in Bogot\u00e1, 1801.<ref>Tome XII of the \u201cBolet\u00edn de Historia y Antig\u00fcedades\u201d Bulletin of History and Antiquities</ref>\n\nJudging by these family records and the fact that Policarpa was born between her two religious brothers, she would appear to have been born between 1791 and 1796. The records also seem to indicate that the Salavarrieta family lived in Guaduas and moved to [[Bogot\u00e1]] after Manuel was born in 1796.\n\nIn an attempt to reconcile the discrepancies the [[Colombian Academy of History]] gave its final ruling on September 10, 1991, in favour of [[Guaduas]], [[Cundinamarca State|Cundinamarca]], as Policarpa's birthplace.<ref name=\"mn\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.museonacional.gov.co/body_policarpa_salavarrieta.html|title=Policarpa Salavarrieta|accessdate=2007-11-21|publisher=[[National Museum of Colombia]]|language=Spanish|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927013113/http://www.museonacional.gov.co/body_policarpa_salavarrieta.html|archivedate=2007-09-27}}</ref>\n\n== Early years ==\n{{More citations needed|date=November 2010}}\n[[File:Policarpa.jpg|thumb|Watercolor by Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Espinosa]]\nWithout being titled or of the [[Hidalgo (Spanish nobility)|hidalgo]] class, Policarpa's family were apparently respectable and well-off, judging by her childhood home in [[Guaduas]], now a museum. The Salavarrieta R\u00edos family moved to [[Bogot\u00e1]] between 1796\u20131798, living in a small house in the Santa B\u00e1rbara \n\nIn 1802 a [[smallpox]] [[epidemic]] broke out in the capital, killing thousands, including Policarpa\u2019s father, mother, brother Eduardo and sister Mar\u00eda Ignacia. After the tragedy, the family fell apart: Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda and Manuel joining the [[Augustinian]] order, Ram\u00f3n and Francisco Antonio traveled to [[Tena, Ecuador|Tena]] where they found work on a farm. Catarina, the oldest surviving child, decided to move back to Guaduas around 1804, taking her younger siblings Policarpa and Bibiano with her. They lived in the houses of their [[godparent|godmother]] Margarita Beltr\u00e1n and their aunt Manuela until Catarina married Domingo Garc\u00eda, again taking her two siblings with her.\n\nThere is little information about this period in Policarpa's life. What is known is that she worked as a seamstress, and is also believed to have worked as a teacher in a public school.\n\nAt that time Guaduas was an important rest stop on the most important road through New Granada, a stretch of land from Bogot\u00e1 to the [[Magdalena River]] communicating with the north of the country and out to the [[Caribbean Sea]]: soldiers, nobles, artisans, farmers, insurgents, Spaniards and Grenadines of all walks of life passed through Guaduas, making it both a centre of commerce and of news and information.  During the war, Policarpa's family were involved on the Revolutionary side: her brother-in-law, Domingo Garc\u00eda, died fighting alongside [[Antonio Nari\u00f1o]] in the Southern Campaign, in which her brother Bibiano also fought.<ref name=\"nl\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.lablaa.org/blaavirtual/biografias/salapoli.htm|title=Salavarrieta, Policarpa |accessdate=2007-11-21|publisher=Gran Enciclopedia de Colombia|language=Spanish}}</ref>\n\nAccording to legend, after the Revolution broke out, the [[Viceroy]] [[Antonio Jos\u00e9 Amar y Borb\u00f3n]] and his wife Mar\u00eda Francisca Villanov\u00e1, fearing for their lives, were smuggled out of Bogot\u00e1 by the mayor [[Jos\u00e9 Miguel Pey de Andrade]]. They stopped in Guaduas, where the [[Vicereine]], Mar\u00eda Francisca Villanov\u00e1, is supposed to have gone to Policarpa's house and foretold her imminent destiny and death.\n\n== Revolutionary ==\nHistory indicates that Policarpa was not involved in politics before 1810, but by the time she moved back to Bogot\u00e1 in 1817, she was actively participating in political issues. Because Bogot\u00e1 was the stronghold of the [[Reconquista (Spanish America)|Reconquista]], where most of the population were Spanish [[Royalist (Spanish American Independence)|Royalist]]s and approved of the take over by [[Pablo Morillo]], it was very difficult to get in and out of the city. Policarpa and her brother Bibiano entered the capital with forged documents and safeguards, and a letter of introduction written by Ambrosio Almeyda and Jos\u00e9 Rodr\u00edguez, two Revolutionary leaders; they recommended her and her brother stay in the house of [[Andrea Ricaurte y Lozano]] under cover of working as her servants. In reality, Andrea Ricaurte's home was the centre of intelligence gathering and resistance in the capital.\n\nIn Guaduas, Policarpa was known as a revolutionary. Because she was not known in [[Bogot\u00e1]], she could move freely and meet with other patriots and spies unsuspected. She could also infiltrate the homes of the royalists. Offering her services as a seamstress to the wives and daughters of royalists and officers, Policarpa altered and mended for them and their families; at the same time, she overheard conversations, collected maps and intelligence on their plans and activities, identified who the major royalists were, and found out who were suspected of being revolutionaries.\n\nPolicarpa also secretly [[recruitment|recruited]] young men to the Revolutionary cause; with assistance from her brother. Together, they helped increase the number of soldiers the insurgency in Cundinamarca desperately needed.\n\n== Capture ==\n[[File:La Pola en capilla.jpg|thumb|La Pola in the Chapel, just before her arrest.]]\nPolicarpa's operations ran smoothly and undetected until the Almeyda brothers were apprehended while carrying information back to the insurgents outside [[Bogot\u00e1]]. Their information directly linked La Pola to the Revolution. The Almeyda brothers and La Pola were implicated in helping soldiers [[desertion|desert]] the Royal Army and join the Revolution; transporting weapons, ammunitions and supplies to the insurgents; in helping the Almeydas escape from prison when they were captured in September of the same year, and finding them refuge in [[Machet\u00e1]]. They had hoped their connection with La Pola could come in handy in the event of a revolt in the city. The loyalists now suspected her of treason, but lacked solid evidence to accuse a seamstress of espionage and treason.\n\nThe arrest of Alejo Sabara\u00edn while he was trying to escape to [[Casanare Department|Casanare]] was the event that allowed the royalists to arrest La Pola; he was apprehended with a list of Royalist and Patriots given to him by Policarpa.\n\nSergeant Iglesias, the principal [[Spain|Spanish]] officer in Bogot\u00e1, was charged with finding and arresting her. Policarpa Salavarrieta and her brother Bibiano were both arrested at the house of Andrea Ricaurte y Lozano and taken to the [[Universidad del Rosario|Colegio Mayor de Nuestra Se\u00f1ora del Rosario]], which had been turned into a makeshift prison.\n\n== Trial and death ==\n[[File:San Agustin.JPG|thumb|'''Church of San Agust\u00edn''' at night, [[La Candelaria]], [[Bogot\u00e1]].]]\nThey were taken to the [[Council of war]] and on November 10, Policarpa, Alejo, and six other prisoners were sentenced to [[execution by firing squad]],<ref name=\"Arismendi51\">Arismendi Posada, Ignacio; ''Gobernantes Colombianos''; trans. Colombian Presidents; Interprint Editors Ltd.; Italgraf; Segunda Edici\u00f3n; Page 51; Bogot\u00e1, Colombia; 1983</ref> set for the morning of November 14, 1817.\n\nThe hour chosen for her execution was nine in the morning of November 14. Hands bound, La Pola marched to her death with two priests by her side and led by a guard. Instead of repeating the prayers the priests were reciting, she cursed the Spaniards and predicted their defeat in the coming Revolution. It is said that La Pola cursed the Spaniards relentlessly during the night before her execution. At one point she stopped, tired and thirsty, and one of the guards offered her a glass of wine. She tossed the glass right back at her captors, proclaiming \"I would not accept even a glass of water from my enemies!\".\n\nShe was to die with six other prisoners and her lover, Alejo Sabara\u00edn, in the [[Bol\u00edvar Square]]. After ascending the scaffold she was told to turn her back, as that was the way traitors were killed. As she was led to her execution, Policarpa gave heart to the other prisoners and berated her captors. La Pola, refusing to kneel to the Spanish firing squad, yelled, \"I have more than enough courage to suffer this death and a thousand more. Do not forget my example.\"  When the squad began shooting, Pola turned around to face the squad.\n\nAs was customary, the bodies of Alejo and the other six prisoners were paraded and exhibited through the streets of [[Bogot\u00e1]], to scare off would-be Revolutionaries. Being a woman, she was spared this final humiliation.\n\nHer [[Augustinian]] friar brothers, Jos\u00e9 Maria de Los \u00c1ngeles and Manuel Salavarrieta, claimed the body, to give her a proper [[Christian burial]] in the [[convent]] church of San Agust\u00edn, in the neighborhood of [[La Candelaria]].<ref name=\"p200\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.lablaa.org/blaavirtual/todaslasartes/pola/cronol.htm|title=Cronolog\u00eda de Policarpa Salavarrieta (Chronology of Policarpa Salavarrieta)|accessdate=2007-11-21|publisher=[[National Museum of Colombia]]|language=Spanish}}</ref>\n\n== Commemoration ==\n\n===Day of the Colombian Woman===\nOn November 8, 1967, Law 44 was passed by the [[Congress of the Republic of Colombia]] and signed by [[President of Colombia|President]] [[Carlos Lleras Restrepo]], which declared in its 2nd Article that November 14 would be the \u201cDay of the Colombian Woman\u201d in honour of the anniversary of the death of \u201cOur heroine, Policarpa Salavarrieta\u201d.<ref name=\"vdg\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.villadeguaduas.gov.co/index.php?m1=noticias&m2=det&m3=211|title=Dia De La Mujer Columbiavdg|accessdate=2007-11-21|publisher=[[Guaduas]]|language=Spanish|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071009170310/http://www.villadeguaduas.gov.co/index.php?m1=noticias&m2=det&m3=211|archivedate=2007-10-09}}</ref><ref name=\"anrc\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.armada.mil.co/index.php?idcategoria=36508|title=Las Mujeres en el desarrollo de Colombia (Women in the Development of Colombia)|accessdate=2007-11-21|publisher=[[Colombian National Armada]]|language=Spanish}}</ref>\n\n===Colombian currency===\nPolicarpa Salavarrieta has been depicted on [[Colombian Peso|Colombian Currency]] many times over the years.

She was captured by Spanish [[Ferdinand VII of Spain|Royalist]]s and ultimately executed for [[high treason]]. The Day of the Colombian Woman is commemorated on the anniversary of her death. She is now considered a [[heroine]] of the independence of [[Colombia]].\n\n== Name ==\nBecause her [[birth certificate]] was never found, her legal [[given name]] is unknown. The name Salavarrieta is known only by the names her family and friends used. Her father referred to her as Apolonia in his [[will (law)|will]], which Salvador Contreras, the [[priest]] who formalized the testament on 13 December 1802, confirmed.<ref>Will of Joaquin Salavarrieta, to Doctor D. Salvador Contreras,  Protocol of the 3rd Notary of Bogot\u00e1, scrivener Pedro Joaqu\u00edn Maldonado, 1802, \u201cArchivo General de la Naci\u00f3n\u201d, folders 229v. to 231v and 289r to 291v.</ref> She was closest to her brother, Viviano, as she became his de facto guardian when her parents died. When the armed forces in Guaduas started looking for her, she began calling herself Policarpa.\n\nIn her 1817 forged [[passport]], used to get in and out of [[Bogot\u00e1]] during the [[Reconquista (Spanish America)|Reconquista]], she appeared as \"Gregoria Apolinaria.\" [[Andrea Ricaurte de Lozano]], whom Policarpa lived with, and officially worked for in [[Bogot\u00e1]], as well as Ambrosio Almeyda, a [[guerrilla]] leader to whom she supplied information, also called her by that name. Her contemporaries referred to her simply as \"La Pola,\" but Policarpa Salavarrieta is the name by which she is remembered and commemorated.\n\n== Place and date of birth ==\nLa Pola's [[date of birth|date]] and [[birthplace|place of birth]] are also subject to conjecture in the absence of legal documents. The popular version is that she was born in the [[municipalities of Colombia|municipality]] of [[Guaduas]], [[Cundinamarca State|Cundinamarca]], between 1790 and 1796. However [[Rafael Pombo]] affirmed that she had been born in [[Mariquita, Tolima|Mariquita]], while [[Jos\u00e9 Caicedo Rojas]] confirmed it as [[Bogot\u00e1]].\n\nHer date and place of birth can be surmised from information available about her siblings which, curiously enough, were not lost.\n\nHer siblings were:\n\n*Mar\u00eda Ignacia Clara, born in the San Miguel parish of Guaduas August 12, 1789 \u2013 1802\n*Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda de los \u00c1ngeles, [[baptised]] in Guaduas on August 12, 1790 - became an [[Augustinian]] [[friar]]\n*Catarina, born in Guaduas, 1791\n*Eduardo, born in Guaduas on November 3, 1792 \u2013 1802\n*Manuel, born in Guaduas on May 26, 1796 - also became an [[Augustinian]] [[friar]]\n*Francisco Antonio, baptised in the Santa B\u00e1rbara parish, [[Bogot\u00e1]], 26 September 1798\n*Ram\u00f3n, [[Confirmation|confirmed]] in Bogot\u00e1 in 1800\n*Bibiano, baptised in Bogot\u00e1, 1801.<ref>Tome XII of the \u201cBolet\u00edn de Historia y Antig\u00fcedades\u201d Bulletin of History and Antiquities</ref>\n\nJudging by these family records and the fact that Policarpa was born between her two religious brothers, she would appear to have been born between 1791 and 1796. The records also seem to indicate that the Salavarrieta family lived in Guaduas and moved to [[Bogot\u00e1]] after Manuel was born in 1796.\n\nIn an attempt to reconcile the discrepancies the [[Colombian Academy of History]] gave its final ruling on September 10, 1991, in favour of [[Guaduas]], [[Cundinamarca State|Cundinamarca]], as Policarpa's birthplace.<ref name=\"mn\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.museonacional.gov.co/body_policarpa_salavarrieta.html|title=Policarpa Salavarrieta|accessdate=2007-11-21|publisher=[[National Museum of Colombia]]|language=Spanish|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927013113/http://www.museonacional.gov.co/body_policarpa_salavarrieta.html|archivedate=2007-09-27}}</ref>\n\n== Early years ==\n{{More citations needed|date=November 2010}}\n[[File:Policarpa.jpg|thumb|Watercolor by Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Espinosa]]\nWithout being titled or of the [[Hidalgo (Spanish nobility)|hidalgo]] class, Policarpa's family were apparently respectable and well-off, judging by her childhood home in [[Guaduas]], now a museum. The Salavarrieta R\u00edos family moved to [[Bogot\u00e1]] between 1796\u20131798, living in a small house in the Santa B\u00e1rbara \n\nIn 1802 a [[smallpox]] [[epidemic]] broke out in the capital, killing thousands, including Policarpa\u2019s father, mother, brother Eduardo and sister Mar\u00eda Ignacia. After the tragedy, the family fell apart: Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda and Manuel joining the [[Augustinian]] order, Ram\u00f3n and Francisco Antonio traveled to [[Tena, Ecuador|Tena]] where they found work on a farm. Catarina, the oldest surviving child, decided to move back to Guaduas around 1804, taking her younger siblings Policarpa and Bibiano with her. They lived in the houses of their [[godparent|godmother]] Margarita Beltr\u00e1n and their aunt Manuela until Catarina married Domingo Garc\u00eda, again taking her two siblings with her.\n\nThere is little information about this period in Policarpa's life. What is known is that she worked as a seamstress, and is also believed to have worked as a teacher in a public school.\n\nAt that time Guaduas was an important rest stop on the most important road through New Granada, a stretch of land from Bogot\u00e1 to the [[Magdalena River]] communicating with the north of the country and out to the [[Caribbean Sea]]: soldiers, nobles, artisans, farmers, insurgents, Spaniards and Grenadines of all walks of life passed through Guaduas, making it both a centre of commerce and of news and information.  During the war, Policarpa's family were involved on the Revolutionary side: her brother-in-law, Domingo Garc\u00eda, died fighting alongside [[Antonio Nari\u00f1o]] in the Southern Campaign, in which her brother Bibiano also fought.<ref name=\"nl\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.lablaa.org/blaavirtual/biografias/salapoli.htm|title=Salavarrieta, Policarpa |accessdate=2007-11-21|publisher=Gran Enciclopedia de Colombia|language=Spanish}}</ref>\n\nAccording to legend, after the Revolution broke out, the [[Viceroy]] [[Antonio Jos\u00e9 Amar y Borb\u00f3n]] and his wife Mar\u00eda Francisca Villanov\u00e1, fearing for their lives, were smuggled out of Bogot\u00e1 by the mayor [[Jos\u00e9 Miguel Pey de Andrade]]. They stopped in Guaduas, where the [[Vicereine]], Mar\u00eda Francisca Villanov\u00e1, is supposed to have gone to Policarpa's house and foretold her imminent destiny and death.\n\n== Revolutionary ==\nHistory indicates that Policarpa was not involved in politics before 1810, but by the time she moved back to Bogot\u00e1 in 1817, she was actively participating in political issues. Because Bogot\u00e1 was the stronghold of the [[Reconquista (Spanish America)|Reconquista]], where most of the population were Spanish [[Royalist (Spanish American Independence)|Royalist]]s and approved of the take over by [[Pablo Morillo]], it was very difficult to get in and out of the city. Policarpa and her brother Bibiano entered the capital with forged documents and safeguards, and a letter of introduction written by Ambrosio Almeyda and Jos\u00e9 Rodr\u00edguez, two Revolutionary leaders; they recommended her and her brother stay in the house of [[Andrea Ricaurte y Lozano]] under cover of working as her servants. In reality, Andrea Ricaurte's home was the centre of intelligence gathering and resistance in the capital.\n\nIn Guaduas, Policarpa was known as a revolutionary. Because she was not known in [[Bogot\u00e1]], she could move freely and meet with other patriots and spies unsuspected. She could also infiltrate the homes of the royalists. Offering her services as a seamstress to the wives and daughters of royalists and officers, Policarpa altered and mended for them and their families; at the same time, she overheard conversations, collected maps and intelligence on their plans and activities, identified who the major royalists were, and found out who were suspected of being revolutionaries.\n\nPolicarpa also secretly [[recruitment|recruited]] young men to the Revolutionary cause; with assistance from her brother. Together, they helped increase the number of soldiers the insurgency in Cundinamarca desperately needed.\n\n== Capture ==\n[[File:La Pola en capilla.jpg|thumb|La Pola in the Chapel, just before her arrest.]]\nPolicarpa's operations ran smoothly and undetected until the Almeyda brothers were apprehended while carrying information back to the insurgents outside [[Bogot\u00e1]]. Their information directly linked La Pola to the Revolution. The Almeyda brothers and La Pola were implicated in helping soldiers [[desertion|desert]] the Royal Army and join the Revolution; transporting weapons, ammunitions and supplies to the insurgents; in helping the Almeydas escape from prison when they were captured in September of the same year, and finding them refuge in [[Machet\u00e1]]. They had hoped their connection with La Pola could come in handy in the event of a revolt in the city. The loyalists now suspected her of treason, but lacked solid evidence to accuse a seamstress of espionage and treason.\n\nThe arrest of Alejo Sabara\u00edn while he was trying to escape to [[Casanare Department|Casanare]] was the event that allowed the royalists to arrest La Pola; he was apprehended with a list of Royalist and Patriots given to him by Policarpa.\n\nSergeant Iglesias, the principal [[Spain|Spanish]] officer in Bogot\u00e1, was charged with finding and arresting her. Policarpa Salavarrieta and her brother Bibiano were both arrested at the house of Andrea Ricaurte y Lozano and taken to the [[Universidad del Rosario|Colegio Mayor de Nuestra Se\u00f1ora del Rosario]], which had been turned into a makeshift prison.\n\n== Trial and death ==\n[[File:San Agustin.JPG|thumb|'''Church of San Agust\u00edn''' at night, [[La Candelaria]], [[Bogot\u00e1]].]]\nThey were taken to the [[Council of war]] and on November 10, Policarpa, Alejo, and six other prisoners were sentenced to [[execution by firing squad]],<ref name=\"Arismendi51\">Arismendi Posada, Ignacio; ''Gobernantes Colombianos''; trans. Colombian Presidents; Interprint Editors Ltd.; Italgraf; Segunda Edici\u00f3n; Page 51; Bogot\u00e1, Colombia; 1983</ref> set for the morning of November 14, 1817.\n\nThe hour chosen for her execution was nine in the morning of November 14. Hands bound, La Pola marched to her death with two priests by her side and led by a guard. Instead of repeating the prayers the priests were reciting, she cursed the Spaniards and predicted their defeat in the coming Revolution. It is said that La Pola cursed the Spaniards relentlessly during the night before her execution. At one point she stopped, tired and thirsty, and one of the guards offered her a glass of wine. She tossed the glass right back at her captors, proclaiming \"I would not accept even a glass of water from my enemies!\".\n\nShe was to die with six other prisoners and her lover, Alejo Sabara\u00edn, in the [[Bol\u00edvar Square]]. After ascending the scaffold she was told to turn her back, as that was the way traitors were killed. As she was led to her execution, Policarpa gave heart to the other prisoners and berated her captors. La Pola, refusing to kneel to the Spanish firing squad, yelled, \"I have more than enough courage to suffer this death and a thousand more. Do not forget my example.\"  When the squad began shooting, Pola turned around to face the squad.\n\nAs was customary, the bodies of Alejo and the other six prisoners were paraded and exhibited through the streets of [[Bogot\u00e1]], to scare off would-be Revolutionaries. Being a woman, she was spared this final humiliation.\n\nHer [[Augustinian]] friar brothers, Jos\u00e9 Maria de Los \u00c1ngeles and Manuel Salavarrieta, claimed the body, to give her a proper [[Christian burial]] in the [[convent]] church of San Agust\u00edn, in the neighborhood of [[La Candelaria]].<ref name=\"p200\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.lablaa.org/blaavirtual/todaslasartes/pola/cronol.htm|title=Cronolog\u00eda de Policarpa Salavarrieta (Chronology of Policarpa Salavarrieta)|accessdate=2007-11-21|publisher=[[National Museum of Colombia]]|language=Spanish}}</ref>\n\n== Commemoration ==\n\n===Day of the Colombian Woman===\nOn November 8, 1967, Law 44 was passed by the [[Congress of the Republic of Colombia]] and signed by [[President of Colombia|President]] [[Carlos Lleras Restrepo]], which declared in its 2nd Article that November 14 would be the \u201cDay of the Colombian Woman\u201d in honour of the anniversary of the death of \u201cOur heroine, Policarpa Salavarrieta\u201d.<ref name=\"vdg\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.villadeguaduas.gov.co/index.php?m1=noticias&m2=det&m3=211|title=Dia De La Mujer Columbiavdg|accessdate=2007-11-21|publisher=[[Guaduas]]|language=Spanish|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071009170310/http://www.villadeguaduas.gov.co/index.php?m1=noticias&m2=det&m3=211|archivedate=2007-10-09}}</ref><ref name=\"anrc\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.armada.mil.co/index.php?idcategoria=36508|title=Las Mujeres en el desarrollo de Colombia (Women in the Development of Colombia)|accessdate=2007-11-21|publisher=[[Colombian National Armada]]|language=Spanish}}</ref>\n\n===Colombian currency===\nPolicarpa Salavarrieta has been depicted on [[Colombian Peso|Colombian Currency]] many times over the years.

At the time of merger, FleetBoston was the seventh largest bank in United States with $197&nbsp;billion in assets, over 20 million customers and revenue of $12&nbsp;billion.<ref name=\"fleetboston-merger\" /> Hundreds of FleetBoston workers lost their jobs or were demoted, according to ''[[The Boston Globe]]''.\n\nOn June 30, 2005, Bank of America announced it would purchase credit card giant [[MBNA]] for $35&nbsp;billion in cash and stock. The [[Federal Reserve Board]] gave final approval to the merger on December 15, 2005, and the merger closed on January 1, 2006. The acquisition of MBNA provided Bank of America a leading domestic and foreign credit card issuer. The combined Bank of America Card Services organization, including the former MBNA, had more than 40 million U.S. accounts and nearly $140&nbsp;billion in outstanding balances. Under Bank of America the operation was renamed FIA Card Services.\n\n[[File:Bank of America footprint.png|thumb|left|Bank of America footprint]]\nBank of America operated under the name BankBoston in many other Latin American countries, including Brazil. In 2006, Bank of America sold BankBoston's operations to Brazilian bank Banco Ita\u00fa, in exchange for Ita\u00fa shares. The BankBoston name and trademarks were not part of the transaction and, as part of the sale agreement, cannot be used by Bank of America (ending the BankBoston brand).\n\nIn May 2006, Bank of America and [[Banco Ita\u00fa]] (Investimentos Ita\u00fa S.A.) entered into an acquisition agreement through which Ita\u00fa agreed to acquire BankBoston's operations in Brazil and was granted an exclusive right to purchase Bank of America's operations in [[Chile]] and [[Uruguay]]. The deal was signed in August 2006 under which Ita\u00fa agreed to purchase Bank of America's operations in Chile and Uruguay. Prior to the transaction, BankBoston's Brazilian operations included asset management, private banking, a credit card portfolio, and small, middle-market, and large corporate segments. It had 66 branches and 203,000 clients in Brazil. BankBoston in Chile had 44 branches and 58,000 clients and in Uruguay it had 15 branches. In addition, there was a credit card company, OCA, in Uruguay, which had 23 branches. BankBoston N.A. in Uruguay, together with OCA, jointly served 372,000 clients. While the BankBoston name and trademarks were not part of the transaction, as part of the sale agreement, they cannot be used by Bank of America in Brazil, Chile or Uruguay following the transactions. Hence, the BankBoston name has disappeared from Brazil, Chile and Uruguay. The Ita\u00fa stock received by Bank of America in the transactions has allowed Bank of America's stake in Ita\u00fa to reach 11.51%. Banco de Boston de Brazil had been founded in 1947.\n\nOn November 20, 2006, Bank of America announced the purchase of [[The United States Trust Company]] for $3.3&nbsp;billion, from the [[Charles Schwab Corporation]].

With this purchase, Bank of America possessed $1.7&nbsp;trillion in assets. A Dutch court blocked the sale until it was later approved in July. The acquisition was completed on October 1, 2007. Many of LaSalle's branches and offices had already taken over smaller regional banks within the previous decade, such as Lansing and Detroit based [[Michigan National Bank]]. The acquisition also included the [[Chicago Marathon]] event, which ABN AMRO acquired in 1996. Bank of America took over the event starting with the 2007 race.\n\nThe deal increased Bank of America's presence in [[Illinois]], [[Michigan]], and [[Indiana]] by 411 branches, 17,000 commercial bank clients, 1.4&nbsp;million retail customers, and 1,500 ATMs. Bank of America became the largest bank in the Chicago market with 197 offices and 14% of the deposit share, surpassing [[JPMorgan Chase]].\n\n[[LaSalle Bank]] and [[LaSalle Bank Midwest]] branches adopted the Bank of America name on May 5, 2008.<ref>{{cite news|last=Tom |first=Henderson |title=BOA to 'paint the town red' with LaSalle name change |work=[[Crain Communications|Crain's Detroit Business]] |date=April 14, 2008 |url=http://www.crainsdetroit.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20080414/SUB/804140331 |accessdate=May 5, 2008 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080605152132/http://www.crainsdetroit.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=%2F20080414%2FSUB%2F804140331 |archivedate=June 5, 2008 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\nKen Lewis, who had lost the title of Chairman of the Board, announced that he would retire as CEO effective December 31, 2009, in part due to controversy and legal investigations concerning the purchase of Merrill Lynch.

At the time of merger, FleetBoston was the seventh largest bank in United States with $197&nbsp;billion in assets, over 20 million customers and revenue of $12&nbsp;billion.<ref name=\"fleetboston-merger\" /> Hundreds of FleetBoston workers lost their jobs or were demoted, according to ''[[The Boston Globe]]''.\n\nOn June 30, 2005, Bank of America announced it would purchase credit card giant [[MBNA]] for $35&nbsp;billion in cash and stock. The [[Federal Reserve Board]] gave final approval to the merger on December 15, 2005, and the merger closed on January 1, 2006. The acquisition of MBNA provided Bank of America a leading domestic and foreign credit card issuer. The combined Bank of America Card Services organization, including the former MBNA, had more than 40 million U.S. accounts and nearly $140&nbsp;billion in outstanding balances. Under Bank of America the operation was renamed FIA Card Services.\n\n[[File:Bank of America footprint.png|thumb|left|Bank of America footprint]]\nBank of America operated under the name BankBoston in many other Latin American countries, including Brazil. In 2006, Bank of America sold BankBoston's operations to Brazilian bank Banco Ita\u00fa, in exchange for Ita\u00fa shares. The BankBoston name and trademarks were not part of the transaction and, as part of the sale agreement, cannot be used by Bank of America (ending the BankBoston brand).\n\nIn May 2006, Bank of America and [[Banco Ita\u00fa]] (Investimentos Ita\u00fa S.A.) entered into an acquisition agreement through which Ita\u00fa agreed to acquire BankBoston's operations in Brazil and was granted an exclusive right to purchase Bank of America's operations in [[Chile]] and [[Uruguay]]. The deal was signed in August 2006 under which Ita\u00fa agreed to purchase Bank of America's operations in Chile and Uruguay. Prior to the transaction, BankBoston's Brazilian operations included asset management, private banking, a credit card portfolio, and small, middle-market, and large corporate segments. It had 66 branches and 203,000 clients in Brazil. BankBoston in Chile had 44 branches and 58,000 clients and in Uruguay it had 15 branches. In addition, there was a credit card company, OCA, in Uruguay, which had 23 branches. BankBoston N.A. in Uruguay, together with OCA, jointly served 372,000 clients. While the BankBoston name and trademarks were not part of the transaction, as part of the sale agreement, they cannot be used by Bank of America in Brazil, Chile or Uruguay following the transactions. Hence, the BankBoston name has disappeared from Brazil, Chile and Uruguay. The Ita\u00fa stock received by Bank of America in the transactions has allowed Bank of America's stake in Ita\u00fa to reach 11.51%. Banco de Boston de Brazil had been founded in 1947.\n\nOn November 20, 2006, Bank of America announced the purchase of [[The United States Trust Company]] for $3.3&nbsp;billion, from the [[Charles Schwab Corporation]].

With this purchase, Bank of America possessed $1.7&nbsp;trillion in assets. A Dutch court blocked the sale until it was later approved in July. The acquisition was completed on October 1, 2007. Many of LaSalle's branches and offices had already taken over smaller regional banks within the previous decade, such as Lansing and Detroit based [[Michigan National Bank]]. The acquisition also included the [[Chicago Marathon]] event, which ABN AMRO acquired in 1996. Bank of America took over the event starting with the 2007 race.\n\nThe deal increased Bank of America's presence in [[Illinois]], [[Michigan]], and [[Indiana]] by 411 branches, 17,000 commercial bank clients, 1.4&nbsp;million retail customers, and 1,500 ATMs. Bank of America became the largest bank in the Chicago market with 197 offices and 14% of the deposit share, surpassing [[JPMorgan Chase]].\n\n[[LaSalle Bank]] and [[LaSalle Bank Midwest]] branches adopted the Bank of America name on May 5, 2008.<ref>{{cite news|last=Tom |first=Henderson |title=BOA to 'paint the town red' with LaSalle name change |work=[[Crain Communications|Crain's Detroit Business]] |date=April 14, 2008 |url=http://www.crainsdetroit.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20080414/SUB/804140331 |accessdate=May 5, 2008 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080605152132/http://www.crainsdetroit.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=%2F20080414%2FSUB%2F804140331 |archivedate=June 5, 2008 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\nKen Lewis, who had lost the title of Chairman of the Board, announced that he would retire as CEO effective December 31, 2009, in part due to controversy and legal investigations concerning the purchase of Merrill Lynch.
