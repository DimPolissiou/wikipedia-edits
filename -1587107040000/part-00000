At least one tribo-fatigue system can be found in virtually every modern machine, such as a car; the system must be heavily loaded and largely determines the operational reliability of the product. When particular damaging phenomena such as fatigue, friction, and wear are implemented simultaneously and jointly as the complex WFD, which is studied by Tribo-Fatigue, the technical and economic significance to modern technology increases by several times.

In all the graphs the horizontal dotted line means that in calculations based on individual criteria of either mechanical fatigue or tribology, the required parameters are assumed as singles. The curvilinear dotted lines describe the direct or the back effects providing the function of interaction of damages is \u039b<sub>\u03c3/\u03c4</sub>=1. The remaining (solid) lines characterize the above effects with the account of various conditions of interaction of damages: the softening processes prevail at \u039b<sub>\u03c3/\u03c4</sub>>1, the hardening processes prevail at \u039b<sub>\u03c3/\u03c4</sub><1.\n\n[[File:Ris-S4-9.jpg|thumb|<div style=\"text-align: center;\">Figure 4 \u2013 Methods of calculation and design of tribo-fatigue systems</div>|alt=]]\n\nFor example, let us comment on determination of the required cross section of the shaft.

At least one tribo-fatigue system can be found in virtually every modern machine, such as a car; the system must be heavily loaded and largely determines the operational reliability of the product. When particular damaging phenomena such as fatigue, friction, and wear are implemented simultaneously and jointly as the complex WFD, which is studied by Tribo-Fatigue, the technical and economic significance to modern technology increases by several times.

(in Russian).</ref> Tribo-Fatigue moves away from the traditional design of individual parts and turns to the estimation and design of mechanical systems.<ref name=\"Word on Tribo-Fatigue\"/> With regard to the mechanic sliding fatigue of the bending shaft and sliding-surface bearing system, the following tasks can be set and practically solved:\n* determining the required diameter of the shaft taking into account the direct effect,\n* determining the required area of contact of the system elements taking into account the back effect,\n* selecting materials for both elements of the system,\n* setting the requirements of the value of the friction coefficient,\n* calculating the durability of the system and its elements,\n* assessing the reliability of the system under given operating conditions,\n* and calculating the risk factors and indicators of safe system operation.\n\nFigure 4 shows a comparative analysis of the methods of calculation of tribo-fatigue systems based on the criteria of Tribo-Fatigue (the parameters with the index TF), the criteria of mechanical fatigue (the parameters with the index F) and also the tribological parameter or the coefficient of friction. In all the graphs the horizontal dotted line means that in calculations based on individual criteria of either mechanical fatigue or tribology, the required parameters are assumed as singles. The curvilinear dotted lines describe the direct or the back effects providing the function of interaction of damages is \u039b<sub>\u03c3/\u03c4</sub>=1. The remaining (solid) lines characterize the above effects with the account of various conditions of interaction of damages: the softening processes prevail at \u039b<sub>\u03c3/\u03c4</sub>>1, the hardening processes prevail at \u039b<sub>\u03c3/\u03c4</sub><1.\n\n[[File:Ris-S4-9.jpg|thumb|<div style=\"text-align: center;\">Figure 4 \u2013 Methods of calculation and design of tribo-fatigue systems</div>|alt=]]\n\nFor example, let us comment on determination of the required cross section of the shaft. Its diameter ''d''<sub>''F''</sub> taken according to the known method of calculation for mechanical fatigue is assumed equal to a unity ''d''<sub>''F''</sub>=1. \n\nIf the shaft is an element of the tribo-fatigue system, then the allowance for the effect of the processes of friction and wear, that are generally characterized by the relative value of friction stresses \u03c4<sub>''W''</sub><sup>2</sup>/\u03c4<sub>''f''</sub><sup>2</sup>, leads to the fact that in order to provide its strength reliability the value of ''d''<sub>''TF''</sub> can be either significantly less (for example, 0.9''d''<sub>''F''</sub>) or significantly more (for example, 1.3''d''<sub>''F''</sub>) than the value of ''d''<sub>''F''</sub>; it depends on the ratio between the occurring processes of hardening-softening (\u039b<sub>\u03c3/\u03c4</sub>>1 or \u039b<sub>\u03c3/\u03c4</sub><1).\n\nThe analysis of other graphs in Figure 4 leads to similar conclusions in deciding on the selection of the required area of contact, properties of a material, friction coefficient, etc.\n\n== Testing machines ==\n[[File:SZ-01.jpg|thumb|left|<div style=\"text-align: center;\">Figure 5 \u2013 Testing machine SZ-01</div>|alt=]]\n[[File:Tribo-fatigue-8 EN.jpg|thumb|left|<div style=\"text-align: center;\">Figure 6 \u2013 Scheme of the testing machine and formation of the wear-fatigue testing methods (ICS \u2013 information-control system)</div>|alt=]]\nA new class of testing equipment, called SI-series machines, for wear-fatigue testing of materials, models of friction pairs, and tribo-fatigue systems is based on inventions within the Tribo-Fatigue framework (Figure 5).<ref name=\"Wear-fatigue mechanics\"/><ref name=\"International Journal\"/><ref name=\"Mamaeva\">Sosnovskiy, L. \u0410.

(\u5b89\u5434\u5be1\u5987), who was known as the god-daughter of [[Empress Dowager Cixi]].\n\n==Synopsis==\nZhou Ying is sold to the powerful Shen family by her foster father, yet successfully escapes her childish and bratty master Shen Xingyi by sneaking into merchant Wu Pin\u2019s palanquin. After a failed business collaboration that resulted in Shen Yuesheng's (Xingyi's older brother) death, the Shen family suspects that Wu Pin was the culprit behind Yuesheng's death. Xingyi then injures Wu Pin by using a club to hit his forehead multiple times, causing Wu Pin to fall into a coma. After the bride-to-be's father has a last-minute change of heart, Zhou Ying is married to Wu Pin in an effort to dispel bad luck. Miraculously, Wu Pin wakes up on the same night, and the couple share a happy few months together. Wu Weiwen, the patriarch of the family also agrees to educate her in the matters of commerce after witnessing her remarkable business acumen.<ref>{{cite web|title=\u90a3\u5e74\u82b1\u5f00\u6708\u6b63\u5706\u7535\u89c6\u5267\u5907\u6848\u516c\u793a|url=http://dsj.sarft.gov.cn/tims/site/views/include/quickSearch/checkBlueprint/result.shanty?ids=01555727168d1edb4028e4a0542c7027|website=SARFT|publisher=dsj.sarft.gov.cn|accessdate=2017-09-14|language=zh}}</ref>\n\nUnfortunately, Wu Pin is poisoned to death after getting too close to the truth of the failed business collaboration, and Wu Weiwen's imprisonment and death a couple of months later leaves the entire household in disarray. Zhou Ying is determined to turn around their fortune by investing in a cloth factory in [[Shaanxi]]. Meanwhile, Shen Xingyi has also decided to turn over a new leaf, and starts anew in Shanghai. Shen Xingyi's love for Zhou Ying is initially unrequited, though she eventually acknowledges that she has developed romantic feelings for him. However, romantic affections become of little importance in the face of political upheaval and personal revenge - Shen Xingyi joins the anti-Qing reformist movement and plots to kill the Empress Dowager Cixi while Zhou Ying avenges Wu Pin and her father-in-law's deaths by taking Shen Sihai and Du Mingli head on.\n\nAfter much struggle, Zhou Ying ultimately establishes a business empire, and also lends Empress Dowager Cixi a helping hand when she escapes to Jingyang.\n\n==Cast==\n===Main=== \n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! style=\"width:13%\"|Actor !! style=\"width:17%\"|Character !!

commercially successful, and dominated the television ratings throughout its run. Initially it generated much positive reviews and discussion on micro-blog site [[Sina Weibo|Weibo]] and popular review site [[Douban]].<ref>{{cite web|title=\u90a3\u5e74\u82b1\u5f00\u6708\u6b63\u5706\u8bc4\u5206|url=https://movie.douban.com/subject/26801052/|website=Douban|publisher=|accessdate=2017-09-14|language=zh}}</ref> However, halfway through its run, there have been complaints about inconsistent writing, the number of unnecessary character deaths, illogical business transactions and the female lead's excessive number of love interests, which ultimately left the drama with a 7.6/10 rating.<ref>{{cite
