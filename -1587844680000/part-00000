FBI Director [[James Comey]] said the agency would review the e-mails to see if they contained classified material.

They then stopped their work and contacted the team of investigators from FBI headquarters who had handled the probe of Clinton's private email server. The investigators saw enough of the emails to decide that they seem pertinent to the Clinton server investigation and that they might be emails not seen before. Because they feel they need a warrant specific to Abedin's emails, officials have not been able to examine them further.\n\nAbedin is cooperating with the investigation, according to Justice Department and FBI officials.

Puerto Rico has also been influenced by [[Culture of Africa|African culture]], with the majority of Puerto Ricans partially descended from Africans (and Native Tainos), though pure black [[Afro-Puerto Rican]]s are only a significant minority. Puerto Rico has also received immigration from other parts of Spain such as Catalonia as well as from other European countries such as France, Ireland, Italy and Germany. Recent studies in population genetics have concluded that Puerto Rican gene pool is on average predominantly European, with a significant Sub-Saharan African, North African Guanche, and Indigenous American substrate, the latter two originating in the aboriginal people of the Canary Islands and Puerto Rico's pre-Hispanic [[Ta\u00edno]] inhabitants, respectively.<ref name=\"archive.org1\">{{cite web|url=http://lacomunidad.elpais.com/amazonasfilm/2009/7/12/un-estudio-del-genoma-taino-y-guanche-adn-o-dna-primera-parte|title=La Comunidad \u00bb DOCUMENTALES GRATIS \u00bb UN ESTUDIO DEL GENOMA TAINO Y GUANCHE.

Besides [[miscegenation]], the negative impact on the numbers of Amerindian people, especially in Puerto Rico, was almost entirely the result of Old World diseases that the Amerindians had no natural/bodily defenses against, including [[measles]], [[chicken pox]], [[mumps]], [[influenza]], and even the [[common cold]]. In fact, it was estimated that the majority of all the Amerindian inhabitants of the New World died out due to contact and contamination with those Old World diseases, while those that survived were further reduced through deaths by warfare with each other and with Europeans.\n\nBoth run-away and freed African slaves (the Spanish, upon establishing a foothold, quickly began to import African slaves to work in expanding their colonies in the Caribbean) were in Puerto Rico. This interbreeding was far more common in Latin America because of those Spanish and Portuguese mercantile colonial policies exemplified by the oft-romanticized male conquistadors (e.g. [[Hern\u00e1n Cort\u00e9s]]). Aside from the presence of slaves, some indication for why the Amerindian population was so diluted was the tendency for conquistadors to bring with them scores of single men hoping to serve God, country, or their own interests. All of these factors would indeed prove detrimental for the Ta\u00ednos in Puerto Rico and surrounding Caribbean islands.\n[[File:Real C\u00e9dula de Gracia.jpg|left|100px|thumb|Royal Decree of Graces, 1815]]\nIn the 16th century, a significant depth of Puerto Rican culture began to develop with the [[African immigration to Puerto Rico|import of African slaves]] by the Spanish, as well as by the French, the Portuguese, the British, and the Dutch. Thousands of Spanish settlers also immigrated to Puerto Rico from the [[Canary Islands]] during the 18th and 19th centuries, so many so that whole Puerto Rican villages and towns were founded by Canarian immigrants, and their descendants would later form a majority of the population on the island.\n\nIn 1791, the slaves in Saint-Domingue ([[Haiti]]), revolted against their [[French immigration to Puerto Rico|French]] masters. Many of the French escaped to Puerto Rico via what is now the [[Dominican Republic]] and settled in the west coast of the island, especially in [[Mayag\u00fcez, Puerto Rico|Mayag\u00fcez]]. Some Puerto Ricans are of [[British people|British]] heritage, most notably [[Scottish people]] and [[English people]] who came to reside there in the 17th and 18th centuries.\n\nWhen Spain revived the [[Royal Decree of Graces of 1815]] with the intention of attracting non-Hispanics to settle in the island, thousands of [[Corsicans]] (though the island was French since 1768 the population spoke an Italian dialect similar to Tuscan Italian) during the 19th century immigrated to Puerto Rico, along with [[German immigration to Puerto Rico|German immigrants]] as well as [[Irish immigration to Puerto Rico|Irish immigrants]] who were affected by the [[Irish Potato Famine|Irish Potato Famine of the 1840s]], immigrated to Puerto Rico. They were followed by smaller waves from other European countries and China.\n\nDuring the early 20th century [[Jewish immigration to Puerto Rico|Jews]] began to settle in Puerto Rico. The first large group of [[Sephardi Jews|Jews]] to settle in Puerto Rico were European [[refugee]]s fleeing [[German\u2013occupied Europe]] in the 1930s and 1940s. The second influx of Jews to the island came in the 1950s, when thousands of [[History of the Jews in Cuba|Cuban Jews]] fled after [[Fidel Castro]] came to power.<ref name=\"JVL\">{{cite encyclopedia|url=https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/vjw/Puerto_Rico.html |title=Puerto Rico Virtual Jewish History Tour |encyclopedia=Jewish Virtual Library |accessdate=2015-07-23}}</ref>\n\n===Ethnogenesis===\nThe native Taino population began to dwindle, with the arrival of the Spanish in the 16th century, through disease and [[miscegenation]].<ref name=\"kacike.org\">[http://www.kacike.org/GuitarEnglish.html ''Documenting the Myth of Taino Extinction.''

Many Spaniards, especially Canarians, chose Puerto Rico because of its Hispanic ties and relative proximity in comparison with other former Spanish colonies. They searched for security and stability in an environment similar to that of the Canary Islands and Puerto Rico was the most suitable. This began as a temporary exile which became a permanent relocation and the last significant wave of Spanish or European migration to Puerto Rico.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?hl=en-GB&v=HmRIxmMxY6c&gl=GB |title=MANUEL MORA MORALES: Canarios en Puerto Rico.

Even after the attempted assimilation of Puerto Rico into the United States in the early 20th century, the majority of the people of Puerto Rico feel pride in their nationality as \"Puerto Ricans\", regardless of the individual's particular racial, ethnic, political, or economic background. Many Puerto Ricans are consciously aware of the rich contribution of all cultures represented on the island. This diversity can be seen in the everyday lifestyle of many Puerto Ricans such as the profound Latin, African, and Ta\u00edno influences regarding food, music, dance, and architecture.\n\n==Language==\nSpanish and English are the official languages of the entire Commonwealth.

Over 90% of Puerto Ricans at least partially descend from migrants from these two southern regions of Spain. Puerto Rico has also been influenced by [[Culture of Africa|African culture]], with the majority of Puerto Ricans partially descended from Africans (and Native Tainos), though pure black [[Afro-Puerto Rican]]s are only a significant minority. Puerto Rico has also received immigration from other parts of Spain such as Catalonia as well as from other European countries such as France, Ireland, Italy and Germany. Recent studies in population genetics have concluded that Puerto Rican gene pool is on average predominantly European, with a significant Sub-Saharan African, North African Guanche, and Indigenous American substrate, the latter two originating in the aboriginal people of the Canary Islands and Puerto Rico's pre-Hispanic [[Ta\u00edno]] inhabitants, respectively.<ref name=\"archive.org1\">{{cite web|url=http://lacomunidad.elpais.com/amazonasfilm/2009/7/12/un-estudio-del-genoma-taino-y-guanche-adn-o-dna-primera-parte|title=La Comunidad \u00bb DOCUMENTALES GRATIS \u00bb UN ESTUDIO DEL GENOMA TAINO Y GUANCHE.

Besides [[miscegenation]], the negative impact on the numbers of Amerindian people, especially in Puerto Rico, was almost entirely the result of Old World diseases that the Amerindians had no natural/bodily defenses against, including [[measles]], [[chicken pox]], [[mumps]], [[influenza]], and even the [[common cold]]. In fact, it was estimated that the majority of all the Amerindian inhabitants of the New World died out due to contact and contamination with those Old World diseases, while those that survived were further reduced through deaths by warfare with each other and with Europeans.\n\nBoth run-away and freed African slaves (the Spanish, upon establishing a foothold, quickly began to import African slaves to work in expanding their colonies in the Caribbean) were in Puerto Rico. This interbreeding was far more common in Latin America because of those Spanish and Portuguese mercantile colonial policies exemplified by the oft-romanticized male conquistadors (e.g. [[Hern\u00e1n Cort\u00e9s]]). Aside from the presence of slaves, some indication for why the Amerindian population was so diluted was the tendency for conquistadors to bring with them scores of single men hoping to serve God, country, or their own interests. All of these factors would indeed prove detrimental for the Ta\u00ednos in Puerto Rico and surrounding Caribbean islands.\n[[File:Real C\u00e9dula de Gracia.jpg|left|100px|thumb|Royal Decree of Graces, 1815]]\nIn the 16th century, a significant depth of Puerto Rican culture began to develop with the [[African immigration to Puerto Rico|import of African slaves]] by the Spanish, as well as by the French, the Portuguese, the British, and the Dutch. Thousands of Spanish settlers also immigrated to Puerto Rico from the [[Canary Islands]] during the 18th and 19th centuries, so many so that whole Puerto Rican villages and towns were founded by Canarian immigrants, and their descendants would later form a majority of the population on the island.\n\nIn 1791, the slaves in Saint-Domingue ([[Haiti]]), revolted against their [[French immigration to Puerto Rico|French]] masters. Many of the French escaped to Puerto Rico via what is now the [[Dominican Republic]] and settled in the west coast of the island, especially in [[Mayag\u00fcez, Puerto Rico|Mayag\u00fcez]]. Some Puerto Ricans are of [[British people|British]] heritage, most notably [[Scottish people]] and [[English people]] who came to reside there in the 17th and 18th centuries.\n\nWhen Spain revived the [[Royal Decree of Graces of 1815]] with the intention of attracting non-Hispanics to settle in the island, thousands of [[Corsicans]] (though the island was French since 1768 the population spoke an Italian dialect similar to Tuscan Italian) during the 19th century immigrated to Puerto Rico, along with [[German immigration to Puerto Rico|German immigrants]] as well as [[Irish immigration to Puerto Rico|Irish immigrants]] who were affected by the [[Irish Potato Famine|Irish Potato Famine of the 1840s]], immigrated to Puerto Rico. They were followed by smaller waves from other European countries and China.\n\nDuring the early 20th century [[Jewish immigration to Puerto Rico|Jews]] began to settle in Puerto Rico. The first large group of [[Sephardi Jews|Jews]] to settle in Puerto Rico were European [[refugee]]s fleeing [[German\u2013occupied Europe]] in the 1930s and 1940s. The second influx of Jews to the island came in the 1950s, when thousands of [[History of the Jews in Cuba|Cuban Jews]] fled after [[Fidel Castro]] came to power.<ref name=\"JVL\">{{cite encyclopedia|url=https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/vjw/Puerto_Rico.html |title=Puerto Rico Virtual Jewish History Tour |encyclopedia=Jewish Virtual Library |accessdate=2015-07-23}}</ref>\n\n===Ethnogenesis===\nThe native Taino population began to dwindle, with the arrival of the Spanish in the 16th century, through disease and [[miscegenation]].<ref name=\"kacike.org\">[http://www.kacike.org/GuitarEnglish.html ''Documenting the Myth of Taino Extinction.''

Many Spaniards, especially Canarians, chose Puerto Rico because of its Hispanic ties and relative proximity in comparison with other former Spanish colonies. They searched for security and stability in an environment similar to that of the Canary Islands and Puerto Rico was the most suitable. This began as a temporary exile which became a permanent relocation and the last significant wave of Spanish or European migration to Puerto Rico.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?hl=en-GB&v=HmRIxmMxY6c&gl=GB |title=MANUEL MORA MORALES: Canarios en Puerto Rico.

This law remained in effect until the 1950s, although its enforcement was tightened in the late nineteenth century regarding Asian immigrants, and by the Johnson\u2013Reed act of 1924 imposing immigration quotas. In short, until late in the twentieth century, only immigrants of the White \"race\" could hope to become naturalized citizens.

Since 1948, it was decided by Congress that all Puerto Ricans, whether born within the United States or in Puerto Rico, were naturally born [[United States nationality law|United States citizens]].\n\nPuerto Ricans and other U.S. citizens residing in Puerto Rico cannot vote in [[United States presidential election|presidential elections]] as that is a right reserved by the U.S. Constitution to admitted states and the District of Columbia through the [[Electoral College (United States)|Electoral College]] system. Nevertheless, both the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]] and [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]], while not fielding candidates for public office in Puerto Rico, provide the islands with state-sized voting delegations at their presidential nominating conventions. Delegate selection processes frequently have resulted in [[presidential primaries]] being held in Puerto Rico. U.S. citizens residing in Puerto Rico do not elect [[United States House of Representatives|U.S. representatives]] or [[United States Senate|senators]], however, Puerto Rico is represented in the House of Representatives by an elected representative commonly known as the [[Resident Commissioner of Puerto Rico|Resident Commissioner]], who has the same duties and obligations as a representative, with the exception of being able to cast votes on the final disposition of legislation on the House floor. The Resident Commissioner is elected by Puerto Ricans to a four-year term and does serve on [[United States congressional committee|congressional committee]]. Puerto Ricans residing in the U.S. states have all rights and privileges of other U.S. citizens living in the states.\n\nAs statutory U.S. citizens, Puerto Ricans born in Puerto Rico may enlist in the [[U.S. military]] and have been included in the compulsory draft when it has been in effect. Puerto Ricans have fully participated in all [[Timeline of United States military operations|U.S. wars and military conflicts]] since 1898, such as [[Puerto Ricans in World War I|World War I]], [[Puerto Ricans in World War II|World War II]], the [[65th Infantry Regiment (United States)|Korean War]], the [[Puerto Ricans in the Vietnam War|Vietnam War]], the [[Gulf War]], the [[War in Afghanistan (2001\u2013present)|War in Afghanistan]], and the [[Iraq War]].\n\nSince 2007, the Puerto Rico State Department has developed a protocol to issue certificates of Puerto Rican citizenship to Puerto Ricans. In order to be eligible, applicants must have been born in Puerto Rico; born outside of Puerto Rico to a Puerto Rican-born parent; or be an American citizen with at least one year residence in Puerto Rico. The citizenship is internationally recognized by Spain, which considers Puerto Rico to be an Ibero-American nation. Therefore, Puerto Rican citizens have the ability to apply for Spanish citizenship after only two years residency in Spain (instead of the standard 10 years).\n\n===Decolonization and status referendums===\nSince 1953, the [[UN]] has been considering the [[political status of Puerto Rico]] and how to assist it in achieving \"independence\" or \"decolonization.\" In 1978, the Special Committee determined that a \"colonial relationship\" existed between the US and Puerto Rico.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://nacla.org/article/puerto-rico-united-nations |title=Puerto Rico at the United Nations |last=L\u00f3pez |first=Ana M. |date=2014 |website=The North American Congress on Latin America |publisher=The North American Congress on Latin America |access-date=February 21, 2017}}</ref>\n\nThe UN's Special Committee has referred often to Puerto Rico as a nation in its reports, because, internationally, the people of Puerto Rico are often considered to be a Caribbean nation with their own national identity.<ref name=\"United Nations.

Lampworking differs from [[glassblowing]] in that glassblowing uses a furnace as the primary heat source, although torches are also used.\n\nEarly lampworking was done in the flame of an oil lamp, with the artist blowing air into the flame through a pipe or using foot-powered bellows.<ref name=\"cmog\">{{cite web |title=Glass Dictionary: Flameworking |url=https://www.cmog.org/glass-dictionary/flameworking |website=Corning Museum of Glass |publisher=Corning Museum of Glass |accessdate=29 January 2020}}</ref>  Most artists today use torches that burn either [[propane]] or [[natural gas]], or in some countries [[butane]], for the fuel gas, mixed with either [[air]] or pure [[oxygen]] as the [[oxidation|oxidizer]]. Many hobbyists use [[MAPP gas]] in portable canisters for fuel and some use [[oxygen concentrator]]s as a source of continuous oxygen.\n\nLampworking is used to create artwork, including beads, figurines, marbles, small vessels, Christmas tree ornaments, and much more.  It is also used to create scientific instruments as well as glass models of animal and botanical subjects.\n\n==Glass selection==\n\nLampworking can be done with many types of [[glass]], but the most common are [[soda-lime glass]] and lead glass, both called \"soft glass\", and [[borosilicate glass]], often called \"hard glass\". Leaded glass tubing was commonly used in the manufacture of neon signs, and many US lampworkers used it in making blown work.  Some colored glass tubing that was also used in the neon industry was used to make small colored blown work, and colored glass rod, of compatible lead and soda-lime glasses, was used to ornament both clear and colored tubing. The use of soft glass tubing has been fading due, somewhat, to environmental concerns and health risks, but mainly due to the adoption of borosilicate glass by most lampworkers, especially since colored glasses compatible with clear borosilicate were developed.\n\nSoft glass is sometimes useful because it melts at lower temperatures, however it does not react well to quick temperature changes like borosilicate glass does.  Soft glass expands and contracts a lot more than hard glass when heated/cooled, and must be kept at an even temperature while working with it, especially if the piece being made has sections of varying thickness.  If thin areas cool below the \"stress point\", shrinking can cause a crack. Hard glass, or borosilicate, shrinks much less, so is more forgiving.  Borosilicate is just like regular silicate glass (SiO<sub>2</sub>), but it has a more flexible molecular structure from being [[dopant|doped]] with boron.\n\nGlasses to be fused together must be selected for compatibility with each other, both chemically (more of a concern with soft glass than borosilicate) and in terms of [[coefficient of thermal expansion]] (COE) [CTE is also used for Coefficient of Thermal Expansion.]  Glasses with incompatible COE, mixed together, can create powerful stresses within a finished piece as it cools, cracking or violently shattering the piece.  Chemically, some colors can react with each other when melted together.  This may cause desirable effects in coloration, metallic sheen, or result in an aesthetically pleasing \"web effect\".  It also can cause undesirable effects such as unattractive discoloration, bubbling, or devitrification.\n\nBorosilicate glass is considered more forgiving to work with, as its lower COE makes it less apt to crack during flameworking than soda-lime glass or lead glass.  However, it has a narrower working temperature range than the soft glasses, has fewer available colors, and is considerably more expensive.  Also, its working range is at higher temperatures than the soft glasses, requiring the use of oxygen/gas flames instead of air/gas.  In addition to producing a hotter flame, the use of pure oxygen allows more control over the flame's [[oxidizing and reducing flames|oxidizing or reducing]] properties, which is necessary because some coloring chemicals in borosilicate glass react with any remaining oxygen in the flame either to produce the desired final color or to discolor if extra oxygen is present.\n\nLead glass has the broadest working range of the three glasses, and holds its heat better when it is out of the flame.  This gives one more time to adjust one's work when blowing hollow forms.  It is also less likely to crack while working with it in making pieces of variable thickness than is soda-lime glass.\n\n==Tools==\n[[File:Itinerant glassworker exhibition with spinning wheel and steam engine.jpg|thumb|Itinerant glassworker exhibition with spinning wheel and steam engine, 1904]]\nTools for lampworking are similar to those used in [[glassblowing]].  [[Graphite]] is frequently used for the working surfaces of lampworking tools because of its ability to withstand high temperatures, low [[coefficient of friction]], and resistance to sticking to the molten glass.  Steel is used where greater strength is required.  Some molds may be made from fruitwoods, but wood is primarily used for handles of lampworking tools.  Brass may be used for working surfaces where a higher coefficient of friction is desired.\n*'''Bench Burner''' \u2013 A torch that is fixed to the bench which provides a stationary flame.\n*'''Hand Torch''' \u2013 The hand torch allows for more maneuverability of the flame, commonly used on glassworking lathes where there is reduced maneuverability of the piece\n*'''Kiln''' \u2013 the kiln is used to garage and anneal the glass, protecting the piece from thermal shock and relieving thermal stress.\n*'''Marver''' \u2013 flat surfaces used to roll glass upon in order to shape, smooth or consolidate applied decoration, typically made of graphite or [[steel]].\n*'''Paddle''' \u2013 A graphite or metal marver attached to a handle\n*'''Reamer''' \u2013 A piece of graphite or brass on a handle used to enlarge holes.\n*'''Blowhose/Swivel Assembly''' \u2013 A hose, usually latex, is connected to the blowpipe via a hollow swivel, allowing the lampworker to blow into hollow glass forms while rotating them.\n*'''Tungsten Pick''' \u2013 The extreme temperature resistance of [[tungsten]] makes it ideal for raking(dragging glass around on the surface), or to bore a hole through the glass.\n*'''Shears''' \u2013 Steel shears are used to cut the hot glass.\n*'''Claw Grabbers''' \u2013 Metal tool found in various configurations which allows the hot glass to be securely held and rotated, commonly used for finishing pieces after they have been removed from the blowpipe or pontil.\n*'''Lathe''' \u2013 The glassworking [[lathe]] allows for precise rotation and manipulation of glass.  They are especially suited for larger scale work that may be difficult or tiring to turn by hand.\n\n==General methods of beadmaking {{anchor|Beadmaking}} ==\n[[Image:Lampworking.png|thumb|Demonstration of the lampworking process]]\nAfter designing a piece, a lampworker must plan how to construct it.  Once ready to begin, the lampworker slowly introduces glass rod or tubing into the flame to prevent cracking from thermal shock.  The glass is heated until molten, wound around a specially coated steel mandrel, forming the base bead.  The coating is an anti-fluxing bead release agent that will allow the bead to be easily removed from the mandrel, either a clay based substance or Boron nitride.  It can then be embellished or decorated using a variety of techniques and materials.  All parts of the workpiece must be kept at similar temperatures lest they shatter.  Once finished the piece must be annealed in an kiln to prevent cracking or shattering.\n\n[[Annealing (glass)|Annealing]], in glass terms, is heating a piece until its temperature reaches a stress-relief point, that is, a temperature at which the glass is still too hard to deform, but is soft enough for internal stresses to ease.  The piece is then allowed to heat-soak until its temperature is uniform throughout. The time necessary for this depends on the type of glass and thickness of the thickest section.  The piece is then slowly cooled at a predetermined rate until its temperature is below a critical point, at which it can't generate internal stresses, and then can safely be dropped to room temperature.  This relieves the internal stresses, resulting in a piece which should last for many years.  Glass which has not been annealed may crack or shatter due to a seemingly minor temperature change or other shock.\n\n==Types of glass==\n;Rod vs. sheet\nMost lampworkers use [[Rod (geometry)|rod]]s of glass 7\u20138&nbsp;mm in diameter, though pre-made stringers are available in 1\u20133&nbsp;mm sizes, or rods of 15&nbsp;mm or more. Sheet glass can be cut with tools into strips, though it is easier to manipulate if attached to a rod first. Glass is also available in particles of various sizes (frit or powder), which is typically used for surface decorations in lampworked beads.  Many manufacturers who once only sold their glass in sheet or very thick rod now provide rods for lampworking use. [[Window]] glass is usually not used, as it is not formulated for flameworking and there is little variation of color available.\n\n;Soda lime glass\n{{Expand section|date=May 2008}}\nThe most popular glass for lampworking is soda-lime glass, which is available pre-colored. Soda-lime glass is the traditional mix used in blown furnace glass, and lampworking glass rods were originally hand-drawn from the furnace and allowed to cool for use by lampworkers. Today soda-lime, or \"soft\" glass is manufactured globally, including Italy, Germany, Czech Republic, China and America.\n\n;Lead\nIn addition to soda lime glass, lampworkers can use [[lead glass]].  Lead glasses are distinguished by their lower viscosity, heavier weight, and somewhat greater tolerance for COE mismatches.\n\n;Borosilicate\nLampworkers can use [[borosilicate]] glass, a very hard glass requiring greater heat.  Borosilicate originated as laboratory glass, but it has recently become available in color to the studio artist from a number of companies. At one time, soft (soda lime and lead) and hard (borosilicate) glasses had distinctly different looking palettes, but demand by soft-glass artists for the silver strike colors, and the development of the bright, cadmium based `crayon colors' by Glass Alchemy in the boro line, has diminished the distinctions between them.\n\n==Basic \"wound bead\" technique==\n\n[[File:Lampworking-closeup.jpg|thumb|Wound bead technique]]\n*'''Preparing the mandrel''' \u2013 The beadmaker starts by dipping a [[mandrel]], or wire (stainless steel welding wire, cut into lengths) into a release agent. Release agents are either clay based or man made, such as [[boron nitride]].\n*'''Heating rod and mandrel''' \u2013 The flameworker selects rods of glass to heat in the flame of the [[torch]].  When both glass and mandrel are sufficiently warm, the beadmaker starts rotating the mandrel while allowing the glass to wind upon it.\n*'''Shaping the bead''' \u2013 Beads are shaped using a combination of heat, gravity and tools such as graphite paddles, mashers, tweezers, and picks. Presses to create shapes and indent patterns into the glass are also used.\n*'''Decorating the bead''' \u2013 Beads can be decorated by melting stringers, or fibers of glass on the surface, creating dots or lines.  With a sharp pointed tool, feathers, hearts or other designs may be produced.  Metal decorations of copper, silver, gold, palladium and platinum are applied as metal leaf, wire, mesh or fuming.\n*'''Striking''' \u2013 If silver based colors are used (striking colors), the bead must be heated for a few moments in the torch flame or kiln to allow crystals to reform in the glass. This temperature is slightly above the stress relief point.\n*'''Annealing ''' \u2013 Once completed, beads should be heated to 940\u00b0-1050\u00b0F (depending on glass type), until the piece reaches its \"stress relief point\", held at that temp for a short time, then slowly cooled to avoid thermal shock.\n*'''Cold working''' \u2013 The cooled bead can be further decorated.  Standard cold working techniques can be employed such as sandblasting, faceting and  polishing. Etching the finished piece with acid leaves a matte finish.\n\n==Additional techniques for lampworked beads==\nBeads can be sandblasted, or they can be faceted, using [[lapidary]] techniques.  \"Furnace glass\" beads, which are more elaborate versions of the old [[Seed bead]] technique, are widely made today.  [[Chevron bead]]s are multi-layer beads once exclusively made using hot-shop techniques to produce the original tubing; but now some lampworkers make similar designs on their torches before lapping the ends to reveal the various layered colors. As torches get bigger and more powerful, the cross-over between lampworking and furnace glass continues to increase.\n\nFuming is a technique that has been developed in the past 15 years and was popularized by Bob Snodgrass.  Fuming consists of heating silver or gold in the flame, so that the metals vaporize or \"fume\" microscopically thin layers of particles onto the glass.  These particles stick to the hot glass surface changing its color with interesting effects. Silver turns clear glass into a yellowish color, giving shades of blues and greens when backed with a dark color,  while gold turns clear glass shades of pinks and reds.  The precious metal coating becomes increasingly visible the more the glass is fumed.\n\n==Brief history of modern lampworked beads==\nLampworked beads (with the exception of Asian and African beadmaking) have generally been the provenance of Italian, and, later, Bohemian lampworkers for the last four hundred years or so who kept the techniques secret.  Thirty or so years ago, some American artists started experimenting with the form.  Their early efforts, by today's standards, were crude, as there was almost no documentation, and none of the modern tools.  However, they shared their information, and some of them started small businesses developing tools, torches and other equipment.\n\nThis group eventually formed the basis for the [[International Society of Glass Beadmakers]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.isgb.org/|title=ISGB - International Society of Glass Beadmakers|website=www.isgb.org}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n*[[Glass beadmaking]]\n*[[Scientific glassblowing]]\n*[[Leopold and Rudolf Blaschka]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n*Dunham, Bandhu.

Glass which has not been annealed may crack or shatter due to a seemingly minor temperature change or other shock.\n\n==Types of glass==\n;Rod vs. sheet\nMost lampworkers use [[Rod (geometry)|rod]]s of glass 7\u20138&nbsp;mm in diameter, though pre-made stringers are available in 1\u20133&nbsp;mm sizes, or rods of 15&nbsp;mm or more. Sheet glass can be cut with tools into strips, though it is easier to manipulate if attached to a rod first. Glass is also available in particles of various sizes (frit or powder), which is typically used for surface decorations in lampworked beads.  Many manufacturers who once only sold their glass in sheet or very thick rod now provide rods for lampworking use. [[Window]] glass is usually not used, as it is not formulated for flameworking and there is little variation of color available.\n\n;Soda lime glass\n{{Expand section|date=May 2008}}\nThe most popular glass for lampworking is soda-lime glass, which is available pre-colored. Soda-lime glass is the traditional mix used in blown furnace glass, and lampworking glass rods were originally hand-drawn from the furnace and allowed to cool for use by lampworkers. Today soda-lime, or \"soft\" glass is manufactured globally, including Italy, Germany, Czech Republic, China and America.\n\n;Lead\nIn addition to soda lime glass, lampworkers can use [[lead glass]].  Lead glasses are distinguished by their lower viscosity, heavier weight, and somewhat greater tolerance for COE mismatches.\n\n;Borosilicate\nLampworkers can use [[borosilicate]] glass, a very hard glass requiring greater heat.  Borosilicate originated as laboratory glass, but it has recently become available in color to the studio artist from a number of companies. At one time, soft (soda lime and lead) and hard (borosilicate) glasses had distinctly different looking palettes, but demand by soft-glass artists for the silver strike colors, and the development of the bright, cadmium based `crayon colors' by Glass Alchemy in the boro line, has diminished the distinctions between them.\n\n==Basic \"wound bead\" technique==\n\n[[File:Lampworking-closeup.jpg|thumb|Wound bead technique]]\n*'''Preparing the mandrel''' \u2013 The beadmaker starts by dipping a [[mandrel]], or wire (stainless steel welding wire, cut into lengths) into a release agent. Release agents are either clay based or man made, such as [[boron nitride]].\n*'''Heating rod and mandrel''' \u2013 The flameworker selects rods of glass to heat in the flame of the [[torch]].  When both glass and mandrel are sufficiently warm, the beadmaker starts rotating the mandrel while allowing the glass to wind upon it.\n*'''Shaping the bead''' \u2013 Beads are shaped using a combination of heat, gravity and tools such as graphite paddles, mashers, tweezers, and picks. Presses to create shapes and indent patterns into the glass are also used.\n*'''Decorating the bead''' \u2013 Beads can be decorated by melting stringers, or fibers of glass on the surface, creating dots or lines.  With a sharp pointed tool, feathers, hearts or other designs may be produced.  Metal decorations of copper, silver, gold, palladium and platinum are applied as metal leaf, wire, mesh or fuming.\n*'''Striking''' \u2013 If silver based colors are used (striking colors), the bead must be heated for a few moments in the torch flame or kiln to allow crystals to reform in the glass. This temperature is slightly above the stress relief point.\n*'''Annealing ''' \u2013 Once completed, beads should be heated to 940\u00b0-1050\u00b0F (depending on glass type), until the piece reaches its \"stress relief point\", held at that temp for a short time, then slowly cooled to avoid thermal shock.\n*'''Cold working''' \u2013 The cooled bead can be further decorated.  Standard cold working techniques can be employed such as sandblasting, faceting and  polishing. Etching the finished piece with acid leaves a matte finish.\n\n==Additional techniques for lampworked beads==\nBeads can be sandblasted, or they can be faceted, using [[lapidary]] techniques.  \"Furnace glass\" beads, which are more elaborate versions of the old [[Seed bead]] technique, are widely made today.  [[Chevron bead]]s are multi-layer beads once exclusively made using hot-shop techniques to produce the original tubing; but now some lampworkers make similar designs on their torches before lapping the ends to reveal the various layered colors. As torches get bigger and more powerful, the cross-over between lampworking and furnace glass continues to increase.\n\nFuming is a technique that has been developed in the past 15 years and was popularized by Bob Snodgrass.  Fuming consists of heating silver or gold in the flame, so that the metals vaporize or \"fume\" microscopically thin layers of particles onto the glass.  These particles stick to the hot glass surface changing its color with interesting effects. Silver turns clear glass into a yellowish color, giving shades of blues and greens when backed with a dark color,  while gold turns clear glass shades of pinks and reds.  The precious metal coating becomes increasingly visible the more the glass is fumed.\n\n==Brief history of modern lampworked beads==\nLampworked beads (with the exception of Asian and African beadmaking) have generally been the provenance of Italian, and, later, Bohemian lampworkers for the last four hundred years or so who kept the techniques secret.  Thirty or so years ago, some American artists started experimenting with the form.  Their early efforts, by today's standards, were crude, as there was almost no documentation, and none of the modern tools.  However, they shared their information, and some of them started small businesses developing tools, torches and other equipment.\n\nThis group eventually formed the basis for the [[International Society of Glass Beadmakers]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.isgb.org/|title=ISGB - International Society of Glass Beadmakers|website=www.isgb.org}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n*[[Glass beadmaking]]\n*[[Scientific glassblowing]]\n*[[Leopold and Rudolf Blaschka]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n*Dunham, Bandhu.

In the mid 1990s, the brothers Rodriguez met with [[Not4Prophet]] ([[Not4Prophet|Alano Baez]], who had recently left the US Army) in order to start a new band fusing their funk rock style with Not4Prophet's soulful vocals and politically infused anti-corporate lyrics. Ricanstruction performed for the last time on 23 September 2006 at a United Nations rally, demanding independence for their homeland, [[Puerto Rico]]. The band resurfaced in 2010 for one surprise show in East Harlem, New York, performing as \"The Dynamite Bros.\", featuring Arturo and Joseph Rodriguez, Not4prophet, and Fidel Paulino, along with DJ \"[[Johnny Juice]]\" Rosado from [[X-Vandals]] on percussion, and John Restrepo of the Welfare Poets on saxophone.\n\n== Gigs and tours ==\nRicanstruction began to gig in local New York City clubs and squats in the mid 1990s at places such as [[CBGB]], The Continental, [[ABC No Rio]], [[Webster Hall]], The [[Knitting Factory]], [[Wetlands Preserve|Wetlands]] and many other venues.
