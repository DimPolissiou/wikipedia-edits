On a given punctured [[Riemann surface]], Virasoro conformal blocks form a particular basis of the space of solutions of the [[Two-dimensional conformal field theory#Conformal Ward identities|conformal Ward identites]]. Zero-point blocks on the torus are [[character theory|characters]] of representations of the [[Virasoro algebra]]; four-point blocks on the sphere reduce to [[hypergeometric function]]s in special cases, but are in general much more complicated. In two dimensions as in other dimensions, conformal blocks play an essential role in the [[conformal bootstrap]] approach to [[conformal field theory]].\n\n== Definition ==\n\n=== Definition from OPEs ===\n\nUsing [[operator product expansion]]s (OPEs), \nan <math>N</math>-point function on the sphere can be written as a combination of three-point structure constants, and universal quantities called '''<math>N</math>-point conformal blocks'''.<ref name=\"BYB\">P.

In the case <math>N=4</math>, there are three types of conformal blocks, corresponding to three possible decompositions of the same four-point function. Schematically, these decompositions read\n:<math>\\left\\langle V_1V_2V_3V_4\\right\\rangle\n=\\sum_s C_{12s}C_{s34}\\mathcal{F}^{\\text{(s-channel)}}_s = \\sum_t C_{14t}C_{t23}\\mathcal{F}^{\\text{(t-channel)}}_t = \\sum_u C_{13u}C_{24u}\\mathcal{F}^{\\text{(u-channel)}}_u\\ ,\n</math>\nwhere <math>C</math> are structure constants and <math>\\mathcal{F}</math> are conformal blocks. The sums are over representations of the conformal algebra that appear in the CFT's spectrum. OPEs involve sums over the spectrum, i.e. over representations and over states in representations, but the sums over states are absorbed in the conformal blocks.\n\nIn two dimensions, the symmetry algebra factorizes into two copies of the Virasoro algebra, called left-moving and right-moving. If the fields are factorized too, then the conformal blocks factorize as well, and the factors are called '''Virasoro conformal blocks'''. Left-moving Virasoro conformal blocks are locally holomorphic functions of the fields' positions <math>z_i</math>; right-moving Virasoro conformal blocks are the same functions of <math>\\bar z_i</math>. The factorization of a conformal block into Virasoro conformal blocks is of the type\n:<math> \\mathcal{F}^{\\text{(s-channel)}}_{s_L\\otimes s_R}(\\{z_i\\}) = \\mathcal{F}^{\\text{(s-channel, Virasoro)}}_{s_L}(\\{z_i\\})\\mathcal{F}^{\\text{(s-channel, Virasoro)}}_{s_R}(\\{\\bar z_i\\})\\ ,\n</math>\nwhere <math>s_L,s_R</math> are representations of the left- and right-moving Virasoro algebras respectively.\n\n=== Definition from Virasoro Ward identities ===\n\n[[Two-dimensional conformal field theory#Conformal Ward identities|Conformal Ward identities]] are the linear equations that correlation functions obey, as a result of conformal symmetry.\n\nIn two dimensions, conformal Ward identities decompose into left-moving and right-moving Virasoro Ward identities.

The blocks that are defined from OPEs are special cases of the blocks that are defined from Ward identities.\n\n== Properties ==\n\nAny linear holomorphic equation that is obeyed by a correlation function, must also hold for the corresponding conformal blocks. In addition, specific bases of conformal blocks come with extra properties that are not inherited from the correlation function.\n\nConformal blocks that involve only [[Two-dimensional conformal field theory#State-field correspondence|primary fields]] have relatively simple properties. Conformal blocks that involve descendant fields can then be deduced using local [[Two-dimensional conformal field theory#Conformal Ward identities|Ward identities]]. An s-channel four-point block of primary fields depends on the four fields' conformal dimensions <math>\\Delta_i,</math> on their positions <math>z_i,</math> and on the s-channel conformal dimension <math>\\Delta_s</math>. It can be written as <math>\\mathcal{F}^{(s)}_{\\Delta_s}(\\Delta_i|\\{z_i\\}),</math> where the dependence on the [[Virasoro algebra]]'s central charge is kept implicit.\n\n=== Linear equations ===\n\nFrom the corresponding correlation function, conformal blocks inherit linear equations: global and local [[Two-dimensional conformal field theory#Conformal Ward identities|Ward identities]], and [[Two-dimensional conformal field theory#BPZ equations|BPZ equations]] if at least one field is degenerate.<ref name=\"rib14\" />\n\nIn particular, in an <math>N</math>-point block on the sphere, global Ward identities reduce the dependence on the <math>N</math> field positions to a dependence on <math>N-3</math> [[cross-ratio]]s.

Unlike correlation functions, conformal blocks have very simple behaviours at some of these singularities.

In the case <math>N=4</math>, there are three types of conformal blocks, corresponding to three possible decompositions of the same four-point function. Schematically, these decompositions read\n:<math>\\left\\langle V_1V_2V_3V_4\\right\\rangle\n=\\sum_s C_{12s}C_{s34}\\mathcal{F}^{\\text{(s-channel)}}_s = \\sum_t C_{14t}C_{t23}\\mathcal{F}^{\\text{(t-channel)}}_t = \\sum_u C_{13u}C_{24u}\\mathcal{F}^{\\text{(u-channel)}}_u\\ ,\n</math>\nwhere <math>C</math> are structure constants and <math>\\mathcal{F}</math> are conformal blocks. The sums are over representations of the conformal algebra that appear in the CFT's spectrum. OPEs involve sums over the spectrum, i.e. over representations and over states in representations, but the sums over states are absorbed in the conformal blocks.\n\nIn two dimensions, the symmetry algebra factorizes into two copies of the Virasoro algebra, called left-moving and right-moving. If the fields are factorized too, then the conformal blocks factorize as well, and the factors are called '''Virasoro conformal blocks'''. Left-moving Virasoro conformal blocks are locally holomorphic functions of the fields' positions <math>z_i</math>; right-moving Virasoro conformal blocks are the same functions of <math>\\bar z_i</math>.

In yet others, the infection may still be in the incubation period, when it is asymptomatic and may not yet be detectable even by testing.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2020/03/200309110456.htm|title=COVID-19 infections in U.S. may be much higher, new estimates show|date=|website=sciencedaily.com|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=18 March 2020}}</ref>\n{{clear}}\n\n<div class=\"toccolours\" style=\"width:800px; margin:1em 0;\"><center>'''COVID19 Epidemic curve selected countries (Logarithmic scale / from the 100th case)'''</center>\n{{Graph:Chart\n|type=line\n|linewidth=3\n|width=600\n|height=600\n|xAxisTitle= Day \n|xAxisAngle=-40\n|yAxisTitle= No. of new cases\n|legend= Legend \n<!-- PLease clipboard copy the \"}x=...\" and \"y1=...\" lines from the log plot of total cases when you update these charts -->\n\n<!-- Search string CASES_X -->\n|x=1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55,\n<!-- Search string CASES_Y -->\n|y1Title=Italy\n|y1=100,229,322,445,650,888,1128,1694,2036,2502,3089,3858,4636,5883,7375,9172,10149,12462,15113,17660,21157,24747,27980,31506,35713,41035,47021,53578,59138,63927,69176,74386,80539,86498,92472,97889,101739,105793,110574,115242,119827,124632,128948,132547,135586,139422,143626,147577,152271,156363,159516,\n|y4Title=China\n|y4=100,198,270,300,400,547,639,916,1399,2062,2863,5494,6070,8125,9783,11871,16607,19693,23680,27409,30553,34075,36778,39790,42306,44699,59832,66292,68347,70446,72364,74158,75002,75891,76288,76936,77150,77658,78064,78824,79251,79824,80026,80151,80270,80409,80552,80651,80695,80735,80754,80778,80793,80813,80824,80844,80860,80881,\n|y3Title=Czech Rep.\n|y3=100,116,141,189,198,383,450,560,765,889,1047,1161,1287,1472,1763,2022,2395,2657,2817,3001,3308,3589,3858,4190,4472,4587,4822,5017,5312,5569,5732,5902,5991,6059,\n|y2Title=Netherlands\n|y2=100,128,188,264,321,382,503,614,804,959,1135,1413,1705,2051,2460,2994,3631,4204,4749,5560,6412,7431,8603,9762,10866,11750,12595,13614,14697,15723,16627,17851,18803,19580,20549,21762,23097,24413,25587,26551,\n|y5Title=S.Korea\n|y5=100,204,433,602,833,977,1261,1766,2337,3150,3736,4335,5186,5621,6088,6593,7041,7314,7478,7513,7755,7869,7979,8086,8162,8236,8320,8413,8565,8652,8799,8897,8961,9037,9137,9241,9332,9478,9583,9661,9786,9887,9976,10062,10156,10237,10284,10331,10384,10423,10450,10480,10512,10537,10564,\n|y10Title=Slovakia\n|y10=100,105,123,138,179,186,204,216,226,269,292,314,336,363,400,426,450,471,485,534,581,682,701,715,728,742,769,\n|y7Title=Germany\n|y7=100,151,188,240,349,534,684,847,1112,1565,1966,2745,3675,4585,5813,6012,7156,8198,10999,13957,16662,18610,22672,27436,31554,36508,42228,48582,52547,57298,61913,67336,73522,79696,85778,91714,95391,99225,103228,108202,113525,117658,120479,123016,125098,\n|y8Title=Japan\n|y8=100,132,144,157,164,186,210,230,239,254,268,284,317,349,408,455,488,514,568,620,675,716,780,814,829,873,914,950,1007,1054,1086,1128,1193,1291,1387,1499,1693,1866,1953,2178,2384,2617,2920,3139,3654,3906,4257,4667,5347,6005,6748,7370,\n|y9Title=Sweden\n|y9=100,137,161,203,260,356,500,687,814,941,1032,1121,1196,1292,1439,1639,1770,1934,2046,2286,2824,3069,3447,3700,4028,4435,4947,5466,6131,6443,6830,7206,7693,8419,9141,9685,10151,10446,10865,10948,\n|y6Title=United States\n|y6=100,175,252,353,497,645,936,1205,1598,2163,2825,3501,4373,5664,8074,12022,17439,23710,32341,42751,52690,64916,81966,101012,121105,140223,160686,186082,212814,241626,273808,307876,333593,362955,393602,425746,459989,493567,525436,553493,578178,\n|yGrid= |xGrid=\n|yScaleType=log<!-- This is the line that makes this plot have a log axis -->\n|yAxisMin = 100 <!-- Needed to avoid trying to show the values y2, y3 of 0, impossible on log scale because log(0)=-infinity -->\n}}</div>\n<small>*Datasource: Wikipedia</small>\n\n<small>Czech restriction actions:/ '''Day0''': Schools closed / '''Day2''': State of Emergency: close of sport facilities&amp;close restaurants&amp;bars at 8pm,border control,travel restrictions,ban 30+events /'''Day3''': Criminalize spreading virus on purpose/'''Day4''': Complete closure all shops restaurants&amp;bars ex:food shops,petrol,pharmacies/'''Day5''': Nationwide quarantine ex: shopping, employment need/ '''Day6''': Borders closed&amp;closure municipalities in Olomouc region/ '''Day8''': Mandatory nose&amp;mouth cover / '''Day9''': Special 7\u20139 shop-opening hours for seniors.\n</small>\n\n==Basic reproduction number==\nIn epidemiology, [[Basic reproduction number|the basic reproduction number]] (sometimes called basic reproductive ratio, or incorrectly basic reproductive rate, and denoted R<sub>0</sub>, pronounced R nought or R zero<ref>Milligan, Gregg N.; Barrett, Alan D.

In yet others, the infection may still be in the incubation period, when it is asymptomatic and may not yet be detectable even by testing.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2020/03/200309110456.htm|title=COVID-19 infections in U.S. may be much higher, new estimates show|date=|website=sciencedaily.com|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=18 March 2020}}</ref>\n{{clear}}\n\n<div class=\"toccolours\" style=\"width:800px; margin:1em 0;\"><center>'''COVID19 Epidemic curve selected countries (Logarithmic scale / from the 100th case)'''</center>\n{{Graph:Chart\n|type=line\n|linewidth=3\n|width=600\n|height=600\n|xAxisTitle= Day \n|xAxisAngle=-40\n|yAxisTitle= No. of new cases\n|legend= Legend \n<!-- PLease clipboard copy the \"}x=...\" and \"y1=...\" lines from the log plot of total cases when you update these charts -->\n\n<!-- Search string CASES_X -->\n|x=1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55,\n<!-- Search string CASES_Y -->\n|y1Title=Italy\n|y1=100,229,322,445,650,888,1128,1694,2036,2502,3089,3858,4636,5883,7375,9172,10149,12462,15113,17660,21157,24747,27980,31506,35713,41035,47021,53578,59138,63927,69176,74386,80539,86498,92472,97889,101739,105793,110574,115242,119827,124632,128948,132547,135586,139422,143626,147577,152271,156363,159516,\n|y4Title=China\n|y4=100,198,270,300,400,547,639,916,1399,2062,2863,5494,6070,8125,9783,11871,16607,19693,23680,27409,30553,34075,36778,39790,42306,44699,59832,66292,68347,70446,72364,74158,75002,75891,76288,76936,77150,77658,78064,78824,79251,79824,80026,80151,80270,80409,80552,80651,80695,80735,80754,80778,80793,80813,80824,80844,80860,80881,\n|y3Title=Czech Rep.\n|y3=100,116,141,189,198,383,450,560,765,889,1047,1161,1287,1472,1763,2022,2395,2657,2817,3001,3308,3589,3858,4190,4472,4587,4822,5017,5312,5569,5732,5902,5991,6059,\n|y2Title=Netherlands\n|y2=100,128,188,264,321,382,503,614,804,959,1135,1413,1705,2051,2460,2994,3631,4204,4749,5560,6412,7431,8603,9762,10866,11750,12595,13614,14697,15723,16627,17851,18803,19580,20549,21762,23097,24413,25587,26551,\n|y5Title=S.Korea\n|y5=100,204,433,602,833,977,1261,1766,2337,3150,3736,4335,5186,5621,6088,6593,7041,7314,7478,7513,7755,7869,7979,8086,8162,8236,8320,8413,8565,8652,8799,8897,8961,9037,9137,9241,9332,9478,9583,9661,9786,9887,9976,10062,10156,10237,10284,10331,10384,10423,10450,10480,10512,10537,10564,\n|y10Title=Slovakia\n|y10=100,105,123,138,179,186,204,216,226,269,292,314,336,363,400,426,450,471,485,534,581,682,701,715,728,742,769,\n|y7Title=Germany\n|y7=100,151,188,240,349,534,684,847,1112,1565,1966,2745,3675,4585,5813,6012,7156,8198,10999,13957,16662,18610,22672,27436,31554,36508,42228,48582,52547,57298,61913,67336,73522,79696,85778,91714,95391,99225,103228,108202,113525,117658,120479,123016,125098,\n|y8Title=Japan\n|y8=100,132,144,157,164,186,210,230,239,254,268,284,317,349,408,455,488,514,568,620,675,716,780,814,829,873,914,950,1007,1054,1086,1128,1193,1291,1387,1499,1693,1866,1953,2178,2384,2617,2920,3139,3654,3906,4257,4667,5347,6005,6748,7370,\n|y9Title=Sweden\n|y9=100,137,161,203,260,356,500,687,814,941,1032,1121,1196,1292,1439,1639,1770,1934,2046,2286,2824,3069,3447,3700,4028,4435,4947,5466,6131,6443,6830,7206,7693,8419,9141,9685,10151,10446,10865,10948,\n|y6Title=United States\n|y6=100,175,252,353,497,645,936,1205,1598,2163,2825,3501,4373,5664,8074,12022,17439,23710,32341,42751,52690,64916,81966,101012,121105,140223,160686,186082,212814,241626,273808,307876,333593,362955,393602,425746,459989,493567,525436,553493,578178,\n|yGrid= |xGrid=\n|yScaleType=log<!-- This is the line that makes this plot have a log axis -->\n|yAxisMin = 100 <!-- Needed to avoid trying to show the values y2, y3 of 0, impossible on log scale because log(0)=-infinity -->\n}}</div>\n<small>*Datasource: Wikipedia</small>\n\n<small>Czech restriction actions:/ '''Day0''': Schools closed / '''Day2''': State of Emergency: close of sport facilities&amp;close restaurants&amp;bars at 8pm,border control,travel restrictions,ban 30+events /'''Day3''': Criminalize spreading virus on purpose/'''Day4''': Complete closure all shops restaurants&amp;bars ex:food shops,petrol,pharmacies/'''Day5''': Nationwide quarantine ex: shopping, employment need/ '''Day6''': Borders closed&amp;closure municipalities in Olomouc region/ '''Day8''': Mandatory nose&amp;mouth cover / '''Day9''': Special 7\u20139 shop-opening hours for seniors.\n</small>\n\n==Basic reproduction number==\nIn epidemiology, [[Basic reproduction number|the basic reproduction number]] (sometimes called basic reproductive ratio, or incorrectly basic reproductive rate, and denoted R<sub>0</sub>, pronounced R nought or R zero<ref>Milligan, Gregg N.; Barrett, Alan D.

There are two versions of this story, one published in 1902 and the other in 1908. The story written in 1908 has become an often anthologized classic, while the 1902 story is less well known. The 1908 version is about an unnamed male protagonist who ventures out in the subzero [[boreal forest]] of the [[Yukon|Yukon Territory]]. He is followed by a native dog and is en route to visit his friends\u2014ignoring warnings from an older man [an elder from the Sulphur Creek]<ref name=\":0\">{{cite book |last1=London |first1=Jack |title=To Build a Fire |date=29 May 1902 Hundesohn|url=https://americanenglish.state.gov/files/ae/resource_files/to-build-a-fire.pdf.}}</ref> about the dangers of hiking alone in extreme cold. The protagonist underestimates the harsh conditions and slowly begins to freeze to death. After building a fire and leaving it to continue his journey, he later attempts to build another fails, then tries to kill the dog to gain access to its body heat, but fails to do either. He slips into [[unconsciousness]] and dies of [[hypothermia]].\n\nThe 1902 version describes a similar situation with a different plot. Though the structure and story line are similar in both, in 1902 the weather is not as cold and horrendous, no dog follows the protagonist, the fire is not doused, and the man (named Tom Vincent) suffers only from permanent [[frostbite]] and survives to become a more melancholic but wiser person.\n\nThe 1908 \"To Build a Fire\" is an oft-cited example of the [[naturalism (literature)|naturalist movement]] that portrays the conflict of [[Man vs. Nature|man vs. nature]]. It also reflects what London learned in the [[Yukon Territory]].\n\n==1908 version plot==\nAn unnamed man sets out to hike through the forests bordering the [[Yukon River]] on a winter day whose temperature has fallen to \u221275&nbsp;\u00b0F (\u221259&nbsp;\u00b0C). Having ignored warnings against traveling alone in such conditions, he is accompanied only by a large [[husky]] dog. The animal's instincts warn it about the dangers of the extreme cold, but the dog follows the man unwillingly. As they follow the course of a frozen creek, the man is careful to avoid patches of thin ice hidden by the snow that cover pockets of unfrozen water. His goal is to reach a group of prospectors \"the boys\" at their camp by six o'clock that evening.\n\nAt half past noon, the man stops and builds a fire so he can warm up and eat his lunch. Shortly after resuming his hike, he accidentally breaks through the ice and soaks his feet and lower legs, forcing him to stop and build another fire, this one under a tree in order to dry himself. As he pulls twigs from the brush pile around the tree to feed the flames, the vibrations eventually cause the snow to tumble down from the branches overhead and extinguish the fire. The man quickly begins to lose sensation in his extremities and hurries to light another fire, now starting to understand the warnings about the life-threatening danger posed by the extreme cold. He lights the fire, igniting all of his matches and burning himself in the process due to the numbness in his hands. While trying to remove a piece of moss from the fire, he inadvertently pokes the burning twigs apart and extinguishes them. With no way to start another fire, the man tries to kill the dog and use its body heat to save himself, but his hands are so stiff that he can neither strangle the animal nor draw his knife to cut its throat. Finally, he tries to restore his circulation by running toward the camp, but stumbles and falls multiple times in the snow. The man dies of [[hypothermia]], imagining himself standing with \"the boys\" as they find his body, and the dog leaves the body after dark to find food and shelter at the camp.\n\n==Character relationships==\nThe protagonist and the old man of Sulphur Creek are seen in the beginning of the story. The old man of Sulphur Creek warns the protagonist about the danger of travelling alone in such cold temperatures, but being ignorant the protagonist scoffs at the advice of the old man. The protagonist is seen reflecting on his advice towards his demise, and realizes that the old man of Sulphur Creek was right in his warning.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nThe man and the dog's relationship is followed throughout the story. The man has strict control of the dog, as explicitly mentioned by London. The dog is almost like the man's slave.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Ulicne|first1=Chris|title=The Unmentioned|url=http://blogs.setonhill.edu/ChristopherUlicne/coursework007137.html|website=Stone Hill College|accessdate=5 April 2018}}</ref> The dog is shown cowering before the man and following orders. There is no physical intimacy or compassion between the two. The man does not pet the dog or treat it fondly. In fact, the man forces the dog to go ahead of him when he suspects the ice will break. This helps to build the idea that the man believes nature is intended to serve him.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Fleissner|first1=Jennifer|title=\"To Build a Fire\": An Environmentalist Interpretation|url=http://americainclass.org/to-build-a-fire-an-environmentalist-interpretation/|website=America In Class|accessdate=5 April 2018|date=January 2013}}</ref> The man's interactions in this relationship is how the reader discovers the man's personality and character. By including the dog, the author makes the man less likable. He was cruel towards the dog by having the dog walk in extreme temperatures. Moreover, in the end, he tried to kill the dog for his own benefit. London even describes the dog as his \"toil-slave\".<ref name=\"story\">{{cite magazine|date=August 1908|title=To Build a Fire|volume=76|last=London|first=Jack|magazine=The Century Magazine |pages=525\u2013534 |url=http://london.sonoma.edu/Writings/LostFace/fire.html |access-date=April 16, 2019 |via=London.Sonoma.edu}} Full text of the famous second version, published for an adult audience.</ref>\n\nWhile the man sees the dog only as his slave on the journey, the dog sees the man as a provider of his needs, which helps follow his [[instincts]].{{Citation needed|date=May 2019}} Placing the dog in the story allowed London to show the wisdom of nature over the [[arrogance]] of the man, which eventually leads to his demise. <ref>{{cite magazine |title=\"Never Travel Alone\": Naturalism, Jack London, and the White Silence |author=Jeanne Campbell Reesman |magazine=American Literary Realism, 1870\u20131910 |volume=29 |issue=2 |date=Winter 1997 |pages=33\u201349 |publisher=University of Illinois Press |jstor=27746687 }}</ref> Doing so, allowed London to show that animals survive through instinct.

The protagonist decides to face the brutally cold temperatures of the [[Yukon Territory]], despite being warned by an older man. The short story depicts the protagonist's battle of life and death while highlighting the importance of the fire.\n\nOne theme illustrated in the story is the man's sense of judgment contrasted with the dog's animal [[instinct]]s. Throughout the story, London hints that the dog has more knowledge of survival than the man. The judgment-versus-instinct theme is evident when the man builds the first fire. While the dog wants to stay by the fire to keep warm, the man is determined to keep moving. As the dog reluctantly follows the man across a frozen river, the dog is more cautious than the man.\n\nThe protagonist's desperation is evident throughout the majority of the story. It is noticeable soon after the man falls into a frozen-over river. In order to save himself, he scrambles to build a fire but is too busy worrying about his survival to notice the mistake of building a fire underneath a tree which has collected an enormous amount of snow. After the first fire is put out, his desperation becomes more defined as he seemingly will do anything to survive, including attempting to kill his dog for warmth and using all his matches at once in a final attempt to light his last fire. His desperation for survival and his fear of death cause him to panic, leading to his final demise as he freezes to death at the end of the story.<ref name=\"story\" />\n\n\"[[Perseverance (virtue)|Perseverance]]\" Another evident theme in the story is perseverance. Although the man makes several mistakes and is getting frostbite in his fingers and toes, he continues to fight for survival. He ignored all the signs that he would not make it to the village he was headed to. For instance, London described \u201cHe did not bare his fingers more than a minute and was surprised to find that they were numb.\u201d <ref>{{cite book |last1=London |first1=Jack |title=To Build a Fire |date=29 May 1902 |url=https://americanenglish.state.gov/files/ae/resource_files/to-build-a-fire.pdf.}}</ref> In less than 60 seconds his fingers were numb indicating to him that it is too dangerous for him to be outside.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.shmoop.com/to-build-a-fire/perseverance-theme.html|title=To Build a Fire Theme of Perseverance|website=www.shmoop.com|access-date=2019-11-13}}</ref> \n\n\"[[Wisdom and Experience]]\" Another theme that is present is that of wisdom and experience. London shows us throughout the story that the man lacks the knowledge in order to survive in the Yukon.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Welsh |first1=James |title=Masterplots II: Short Story Series |journal=Revised Edition |date=2004 |volume=1 |pages=1\u20133 |url=http://web.b.ebscohost.com.unh-proxy01.newhaven.edu:2048/lrc/detail/detail?vid=6&sid=2ee11b99-9eb2-45d3-9942-5949eaec8c5a%40pdc-v-sessmgr03&bdata=JnNpdGU9bHJjLWxpdmU%3d#AN=103331MSS23119240001174&db=lfh |accessdate=16 April 2019}}</ref> Based on instincts, the dog knew that it was too cold to travel in the snow.

However, the unnamed protagonist ignored all the signs before him. He knew that it was cold but he did not realize the threat this posed on his life.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.shmoop.com/to-build-a-fire/themes.html|title=To Build a Fire Themes|website=www.shmoop.com|access-date=2019-11-13}}</ref> \n\nStupidity and arrogance are personified in the story's protagonist. For example, he goes through the extremely cold territory alone, despite going for the first time. He laughs off the crucial advice from the old man of Sulphur Creek about traveling with an acquaintance because he thinks he knows what he's doing. This arrogance results in the protagonist putting himself in a dangerous situation that was preventable. At first, he thinks it's nothing and that everything will be fine. By the end of the story, he dies as a result of his arrogance. Through this story, London shows how the man's demise is due to his humanity and lack of thought when going into this journey. Also, he shows that the dog survives because of following its instincts which is something that the man does not pay attention to.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Bowen |first1=James |title='To Build a Fire': Epistemology and the White Wilderness |journal=Western American Literature |date=1971 |volume=5 |issue=4 |pages=287\u2013289|doi=10.1353/wal.1971.0004 }}</ref> Another example of arrogance occurs when the protagonist disregards the possibility that there may be situations he cannot overcome. The old man warns the protagonist of this and also seems to have a better understanding of the natural world, respecting the fact that there are some situations the man will be unable to control. Not only does the old man see the protagonist's stupidity, but the dog notices the man's lack of knowledge about the terrain and its obstacles after he fails to keep a fire going.\n\nSuccumbing to death is another theme in the story: more specifically the peace that may be found in death. London foreshadows the death of the man early in the story, so it is not a surprise that the man dies. However, London depicts death quite differently than many other authors do. The man drifts off into a calm, peaceful slumber devoid of suffering and pain. London's use of relaxing words dissuades the reader from feeling a great deal of sympathy for the man, as the death is merciful and graciously anticipated, rather than sad. In contrast to more dramatic depictions of death, London's depiction reveals death as a peaceful escape from tumult and pain.\n\nIndividualism is another common theme London portrays in the story. The man only relies on himself to get him through the Yukon; he doesn't believe that he needs any help. This theme can also be connected to the theme mentioned above of the man's judgment, and the man's arrogance.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://commons.lib.jmu.edu/cgi/cview.cgi/jmurj/vol4/iss1/7|title=James Madison University \u2013 Log in |publisher=Berkeley Electronic Press |website=commons.lib.jmu.edu |url-access=registration |access-date=2018-04-10}}</ref>\n\n==1902 version==\nThe earlier version was first published in ''[[The Youth's Companion]]'' on May 29, 1902.<ref>{{cite magazine|last=London |first=Jack |title=To Build a Fire |url=http://london.sonoma.edu/writings/Uncollected/tobuildafire.html |magazine=Youth's Companion |volume=76 |date=May 29, 1902 |access-date=April 16, 2019 |via=London.Sonoma.edu}} Full text of the first, more juvenile version.</ref> Although it differs in some details, the general structure and storyline are similar; the primary differences are as follows: in the first version it is not as cold, there is no dog, the fire is not doused, and the man (named Tom Vincent) suffers some permanent frostbite damage but survives, sad but wiser.\n\n==Films==\n*''[[:fr:Construire un feu (film, 1928)|Construire un feu]]'' (1927\u20131928) is an early short film by [[Claude Autant-Lara]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.unifrance.org/film/34430/construire-un-feu |title=Construire un feu |language=fr |website=UNIFRANCE |access-date=2019-04-17}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0019787/combined |title=Construire un feu (1930) |website=Internet Movie Database}}</ref> \n*''To Build a Fire'' (1969) was made by [[David Cobham]], with [[Ian Hogg (actor)|Ian Hogg]] as the man and [[Orson Welles]] as the narrator.<ref name=\"Yahoo\">{{cite web |url=https://movies.yahoo.com/movie/1800395257/info |title=To Build a Fire (1969) |website=Yahoo!

There are two versions of this story, one published in 1902 and the other in 1908. The story written in 1908 has become an often anthologized classic, while the 1902 story is less well known. The 1908 version is about an unnamed male protagonist who ventures out in the subzero [[boreal forest]] of the [[Yukon|Yukon Territory]]. He is followed by a native dog and is en route to visit his friends\u2014ignoring warnings from an older man [an elder from the Sulphur Creek]<ref name=\":0\">{{cite book |last1=London |first1=Jack |title=To Build a Fire |date=29 May 1902 Hundesohn|url=https://americanenglish.state.gov/files/ae/resource_files/to-build-a-fire.pdf.}}</ref> about the dangers of hiking alone in extreme cold. The protagonist underestimates the harsh conditions and slowly begins to freeze to death. After building a fire and leaving it to continue his journey, he later attempts to build another fails, then tries to kill the dog to gain access to its body heat, but fails to do either. He slips into [[unconsciousness]] and dies of [[hypothermia]].\n\nThe 1902 version describes a similar situation with a different plot. Though the structure and story line are similar in both, in 1902 the weather is not as cold and horrendous, no dog follows the protagonist, the fire is not doused, and the man (named Tom Vincent) suffers only from permanent [[frostbite]] and survives to become a more melancholic but wiser person.\n\nThe 1908 \"To Build a Fire\" is an oft-cited example of the [[naturalism (literature)|naturalist movement]] that portrays the conflict of [[Man vs. Nature|man vs. nature]]. It also reflects what London learned in the [[Yukon Territory]].\n\n==1908 version plot==\nAn unnamed man sets out to hike through the forests bordering the [[Yukon River]] on a winter day whose temperature has fallen to \u221275&nbsp;\u00b0F (\u221259&nbsp;\u00b0C). Having ignored warnings against traveling alone in such conditions, he is accompanied only by a large [[husky]] dog. The animal's instincts warn it about the dangers of the extreme cold, but the dog follows the man unwillingly. As they follow the course of a frozen creek, the man is careful to avoid patches of thin ice hidden by the snow that cover pockets of unfrozen water. His goal is to reach a group of prospectors \"the boys\" at their camp by six o'clock that evening.\n\nAt half past noon, the man stops and builds a fire so he can warm up and eat his lunch. Shortly after resuming his hike, he accidentally breaks through the ice and soaks his feet and lower legs, forcing him to stop and build another fire\u2014this one under a tree\u2014in order to dry himself. As he pulls twigs from the brush pile around the tree to feed the flames, the vibrations eventually cause the snow to tumble down from the branches overhead and extinguish the fire. The man quickly begins to lose sensation in his extremities and hurries to light another fire, now starting to understand the warnings about the life-threatening danger posed by the extreme cold. He lights the fire, igniting all of his matches and burning himself in the process due to the numbness in his hands. While trying to remove a piece of moss from the fire, he inadvertently pokes the burning twigs apart and extinguishes them. With no way to start another fire, the man tries to kill the dog and use its body heat to save himself, but his hands are so stiff that he can neither strangle the animal nor draw his knife to cut its throat. Finally, he tries to restore his circulation by running toward the camp, but stumbles and falls multiple times in the snow. The man dies of [[hypothermia]], imagining himself standing with \"the boys\" as they find his body, and the dog leaves the body after dark to find food and shelter at the camp.\n\n==Character relationships==\nThe protagonist and the old man of Sulphur Creek are seen in the beginning of the story. The old man of Sulphur Creek warns the protagonist about the danger of travelling alone in such cold temperatures, but being ignorant the protagonist scoffs at the advice of the old man. The protagonist is seen reflecting on his advice towards his demise, and realizes that the old man of Sulphur Creek was right in his warning.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nThe man and the dog's relationship is followed throughout the story. The man has strict control of the dog, as explicitly mentioned by London. The dog is almost like the man's slave.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Ulicne|first1=Chris|title=The Unmentioned|url=http://blogs.setonhill.edu/ChristopherUlicne/coursework007137.html|website=Stone Hill College|accessdate=5 April 2018}}</ref> The dog is shown cowering before the man and following orders. There is no physical intimacy or compassion between the two. The man does not pet the dog or treat it fondly. In fact, the man forces the dog to go ahead of him when he suspects the ice will break. This helps to build the idea that the man believes nature is intended to serve him.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Fleissner|first1=Jennifer|title=\"To Build a Fire\": An Environmentalist Interpretation|url=http://americainclass.org/to-build-a-fire-an-environmentalist-interpretation/|website=America In Class|accessdate=5 April 2018|date=January 2013}}</ref> The man's interactions in this relationship is how the reader discovers the man's personality and character. By including the dog, the author makes the man less likable. He was cruel towards the dog by having the dog walk in extreme temperatures. Moreover, in the end, he tried to kill the dog for his own benefit. London even describes the dog as his \"toil-slave\".<ref name=\"story\">{{cite magazine|date=August 1908|title=To Build a Fire|volume=76|last=London|first=Jack|magazine=The Century Magazine |pages=525\u2013534 |url=http://london.sonoma.edu/Writings/LostFace/fire.html |access-date=April 16, 2019 |via=London.Sonoma.edu}} Full text of the famous second version, published for an adult audience.</ref>\n\nWhile the man sees the dog only as his slave on the journey, the dog sees the man as a provider of his needs, which helps follow his [[instincts]].{{Citation needed|date=May 2019}} Placing the dog in the story allowed London to show the wisdom of nature over the [[arrogance]] of the man, which eventually leads to his demise. <ref>{{cite magazine |title=\"Never Travel Alone\": Naturalism, Jack London, and the White Silence |author=Jeanne Campbell Reesman |magazine=American Literary Realism, 1870\u20131910 |volume=29 |issue=2 |date=Winter 1997 |pages=33\u201349 |publisher=University of Illinois Press |jstor=27746687 }}</ref> Doing so, allowed London to show that animals survive through instinct.

The protagonist decides to face the brutally cold temperatures of the [[Yukon Territory]], despite being warned by an older man. The short story depicts the protagonist's battle of life and death while highlighting the importance of the fire.\n\nOne theme illustrated in the story is the man's sense of judgment contrasted with the dog's animal [[instinct]]s. Throughout the story, London hints that the dog has more knowledge of survival than the man. The judgment-versus-instinct theme is evident when the man builds the first fire. While the dog wants to stay by the fire to keep warm, the man is determined to keep moving. As the dog reluctantly follows the man across a frozen river, the dog is more cautious than the man.\n\nThe protagonist's desperation is evident throughout the majority of the story. It is noticeable soon after the man falls into a frozen-over river. In order to save himself, he scrambles to build a fire but is too busy worrying about his survival to notice the mistake of building a fire underneath a tree which has collected an enormous amount of snow. After the first fire is put out, his desperation becomes more defined as he seemingly will do anything to survive, including attempting to kill his dog for warmth and using all his matches at once in a final attempt to light his last fire. His desperation for survival and his fear of death cause him to panic, leading to his final demise as he freezes to death at the end of the story.<ref name=\"story\" />\n\n\"[[Perseverance (virtue)|Perseverance]]\" Another evident theme in the story is perseverance. Although the man makes several mistakes and is getting frostbite in his fingers and toes, he continues to fight for survival. He ignored all the signs that he would not make it to the village he was headed to. For instance, London described \u201cHe did not bare his fingers more than a minute and was surprised to find that they were numb.\u201d <ref>{{cite book |last1=London |first1=Jack |title=To Build a Fire |date=29 May 1902 |url=https://americanenglish.state.gov/files/ae/resource_files/to-build-a-fire.pdf.}}</ref> In less than 60 seconds his fingers were numb indicating to him that it is too dangerous for him to be outside.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.shmoop.com/to-build-a-fire/perseverance-theme.html|title=To Build a Fire Theme of Perseverance|website=www.shmoop.com|access-date=2019-11-13}}</ref> \n\n\"[[Wisdom and Experience]]\" Another theme that is present is that of wisdom and experience.

It carries the [[Central Artery]] underneath downtown Boston, and is numbered as [[Interstate 93]] (I-93), [[U.S. Route 1 in Massachusetts|U.S. Route&nbsp;1]] (US&nbsp;1), and [[Massachusetts Route 3|Route&nbsp;3]]. It roughly follows the route of the old elevated Central Artery, though the northbound entrance, at the corner of Kneeland Street and Atlantic Avenue, is somewhat east of the southbound exit (at Kneeland and Albany streets) to allow for a reconfigured interchange with the [[Massachusetts Turnpike]]. It runs from the [[Zakim Bunker Hill Bridge]] at its north portal\u2014barely {{convert|165|ft|m}} east of the [[TD Garden]] sports facility's eastern corner\u2014to Boston's [[Chinatown (Boston)|Chinatown]] at its south portal. The tunnel is named for [[Tip O'Neill]], former [[Speaker of the United States House of Representatives]].\n\n==History==\nPlanning for the tunnel began in the mid-1980s, when it was determined that a replacement for the Central Artery was needed. Originally built for 75,000 vehicles a day, the expressway was carrying 200,000 vehicles a day by the early 1990s. It was even projected that, by 2010, there would be 16-hour daily traffic jams that would cost the local economy $500 million annually. Furthermore, the [[North End, Boston|North End]] was cut off from the rest of the city, which hampered economic growth.<ref name=MassDOT>{{cite web |author = Highway Division |date = n.d. |title = Project Background |url = http://www.massdot.state.ma.us/highway/thebigdig/projectbackground.aspx |publisher = [[Massachusetts Department of Transportation]] |accessdate = September 2, 2014 }}</ref>\n\nOne challenge for building the tunnel was constructing the project underneath the existing expressway, as well as crippling the city due to the amount of construction involved.<ref name=MassDOT /> In 1992, construction began on the tunnel, with the relocation of utilities.

Containment is undertaken in the early stages of the outbreak and aims to trace and isolate those infected as well as introduce other measures of infection control and vaccinations to stop the disease from spreading to the rest of the population. When it is no longer possible to contain the spread of the disease, efforts then move to the mitigation stage: measures are taken to slow the spread and mitigate its effects on the healthcare system and society. A combination of both containment and mitigation measures may be undertaken at the same time.<ref name=\"NY0JD\" /> Suppression requires more extreme measures so as to reverse the pandemic by reducing the [[basic reproduction number]] to less than 1.<ref name=\"ImpCollege16mar2020\" />\n\nPart of managing an infectious disease outbreak is trying to decrease the epidemic peak, known as flattening the epidemic curve.<ref name=\"Lancet2020Flatten\" /> This decreases the risk of health services being overwhelmed and provides more time for vaccines and treatments to be developed.<ref name=\"Lancet2020Flatten\" /> Non-pharmaceutical interventions that may manage the outbreak include personal preventive measures, such as hand hygiene, wearing face-masks, and self-quarantine; community measures aimed at physical distancing such as closing schools and cancelling mass gathering events; community engagement to encourage acceptance and participation in such interventions; as well as environmental measures such surface cleaning.<ref name=\"community mitigation\" />\n\nMore drastic actions aimed at containing the outbreak were taken in China once the severity of the outbreak became apparent, such as quarantining entire cities and imposing strict travel bans.<ref name=\"RwmYm\" /> Other countries also adopted a variety of measures aimed at limiting the spread of the virus. South Korea introduced mass screening and localized quarantines, and issued alerts on the movements of infected individuals. Singapore provided financial support for those infected who quarantined themselves and imposed large fines for those who failed to do so. Taiwan increased face mask production and penalized hoarding of medical supplies.<ref name=\"shZdf\" />\n\nSimulations for Great Britain and the United States show that mitigation (slowing but not stopping epidemic spread) and suppression (reversing epidemic growth) have major challenges.<!--ref name=ImpCollege16mar2020--> Optimal mitigation policies might reduce peak healthcare demand by 2/3 and deaths by half, but still result in hundreds of thousands of deaths and health systems being overwhelmed.<!--ref name=ImpCollege16mar2020--> Suppression can be preferred but needs to be maintained for as long as the virus is circulating in the human population (or until a vaccine becomes available), as transmission otherwise quickly rebounds when measures are relaxed.

Containment is undertaken in the early stages of the outbreak and aims to trace and isolate those infected as well as introduce other measures of infection control and vaccinations to stop the disease from spreading to the rest of the population. When it is no longer possible to contain the spread of the disease, efforts then move to the mitigation stage: measures are taken to slow the spread and mitigate its effects on the healthcare system and society. A combination of both containment and mitigation measures may be undertaken at the same time.<ref name=\"NY0JD\" /> Suppression requires more extreme measures so as to reverse the pandemic by reducing the [[basic reproduction number]] to less than 1.<ref name=\"ImpCollege16mar2020\" />\n\nPart of managing an infectious disease outbreak is trying to decrease the epidemic peak, known as flattening the epidemic curve.<ref name=\"Lancet2020Flatten\" /> This decreases the risk of health services being overwhelmed and provides more time for vaccines and treatments to be developed.<ref name=\"Lancet2020Flatten\" /> Non-pharmaceutical interventions that may manage the outbreak include personal preventive measures, such as hand hygiene, wearing face-masks, and self-quarantine; community measures aimed at physical distancing such as closing schools and cancelling mass gathering events; community engagement to encourage acceptance and participation in such interventions; as well as environmental measures such surface cleaning.<ref name=\"community mitigation\" />\n\nMore drastic actions aimed at containing the outbreak were taken in China once the severity of the outbreak became apparent, such as quarantining entire cities and imposing strict travel bans.<ref name=\"RwmYm\" /> Other countries also adopted a variety of measures aimed at limiting the spread of the virus. South Korea introduced mass screening and localized quarantines, and issued alerts on the movements of infected individuals. Singapore provided financial support for those infected who quarantined themselves and imposed large fines for those who failed to do so. Taiwan increased face mask production and penalized hoarding of medical supplies.<ref name=\"shZdf\" />\n\nSimulations for Great Britain and the United States show that mitigation (slowing but not stopping epidemic spread) and suppression (reversing epidemic growth) have major challenges.<!--ref name=ImpCollege16mar2020--> Optimal mitigation policies might reduce peak healthcare demand by 2/3 and deaths by half, but still result in hundreds of thousands of deaths and health systems being overwhelmed.<!--ref name=ImpCollege16mar2020--> Suppression can be preferred but needs to be maintained for as long as the virus is circulating in the human population (or until a vaccine becomes available), as transmission otherwise quickly rebounds when measures are relaxed.

He was an envoy to Denmark from 1702 to 1707.\n\n==Early life==\nVernon was the eldest son of [[James Vernon]] and his wife Mary Buck, daughter of Sir John Buck, 1st Baronet, of Hamby Grange, Lincolnshire. His father was [[Secretary of State (England)|Secretary of State]] under [[William III of England|William III]]. He was educated at Utrecht in 1690, at Rotterdam from 1690 to 1692 and a Utrecht again from 1696 to 1697.<ref name = HOP>{{cite web| url = http://www.historyofparliamentonline.org/volume/1690-1715/member/vernon-james-ii-1677-1756| title=VERNON, James II (1677-1756), of Westminster, Mdx. | publisher= History of Parliament Online| accessdate = 4 June 2019 }}</ref>\n\n==Career==\nIn 1691, Vernon was appointed serjeant of the chandlery. He was appointed an extra clerk of the [[Her Majesty's Most Honourable Privy Council]] in 1697. His first parliamentary attempt was in a by-election in 1698 at [[Penryn (UK Parliament constituency)|Penryn]] when he was unsuccessful. He was groom of bedchamber to Duke of Gloucester from 1698 to 1700. From his close attendance on the Duke he contracted the illness from which the Duke died, and took several months to recover. At the second general election of 1701, he and his father contested [[St Mawes (UK Parliament constituency)|St Mawes]], but were unable to overcome the established interest. From 1701 to 1702 he was a Commissioner of the privy seal. In May 1702, he was elected a [[Fellow of the Royal Society]].<ref>{{cite web | url= http://www2.royalsociety.org/DServe/dserve.exe?dsqIni=Dserve.ini&dsqApp=Archive&dsqCmd=Show.tcl&dsqDb=Persons&dsqPos=3&dsqSearch=%28Surname%3D%27vernon%27%29 | title= Library and Archive Catalogue | publisher= Royal Society | accessdate= 29 October 2010 }}{{Dead link|date=January 2020 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> He served as [[List of Ambassadors from the United Kingdom to Denmark|British envoy to Denmark]] from 1702 to 1707<ref>[http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/catalogue/default.asp?j=1 The National Archives Catalogue], SP75/24-25</ref> and was groom of bedchamber to the Prince of Denmark from 1702 to 1708.<ref name=HOP/>\n\nAt the [[1708 British general election]] Vernon was returned as Whig [[Member of Parliament]] for [[Cricklade (UK Parliament constituency)|Cricklade]]. In early 1709 he supported the naturalization of the Palatines, and in 1710 voted for the impeachment of Dr Sacheverell, later airing his dismay that Whig leaders had made such a fuss about \u2018a factious preacher much below their notice\u2019. He became a Commissioner for excise in 1710, in compensation for his father's dismissal as teller of the Exchequer. The post, worth \u00a3800 a year, made him ineligible to stand at the [[1710 British general election]].\n\n==Later life==\nVernon disentangled himself from politics and chose to serve the Tory administration as an official. In 1713, he married Arethusa Boyle daughter of [[Charles Boyle, Lord Clifford]] of Lanesborough. When King George I came to the throne in 1714 and the Whigs were in power his Whig background served him and he not only kept his post but was also appointed a [[Clerk of the Privy Council (United Kingdom)|Clerk of the Privy Council]] in 1715, which he held for the rest of his life.<ref>[http://www.history.ac.uk/resources/office/privycounc-alpha Officeholders in modern England.]</ref> In 1716 he was again Commissioner of the Privy Seal.<ref name=HOP/> He lost his post at the Excise in 1726 after a disagreement with Walpole, but it was restored in 1728. In 1727 he succeeded his father, but his wife died in 1728.<ref name=HOP/>\n\nVernon devoted his efforts to religious and charitable works. He was a sponsor of the foundation of Georgia and a trustee for Bray's charity. His government duties kept him in London, but by 1733 he had purchased an estate at Great Thurlow, Suffolk, for \u00a315,000. Later he built workhouses for several Suffolk parishes. He died without issue on 15 or 17 April 1756, and was buried at Great Thurlow.<ref name=HOP/>\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n{{s-start}}\n{{s-dip}}\n{{s-bef|before= [[Hugh Greg]]}}\n{{s-ttl|title= [[List of Ambassadors from the United Kingdom to Denmark|British envoy to Denmark]] |years= 1702&ndash;1707 }}\n{{s-aft|after= [[Daniel Pulteney]]}}\n{{s-par|gb}}\n{{s-bef|before= [[Samuel Barker (MP for Cricklade)|Samuel Barker]] | before2=[[Edmund Dunch (Whig)|Edmund Dunch]] }}\n{{s-ttl|title= [[Member of Parliament]] for [[Cricklade (UK Parliament constituency)|Cricklade]] |with= [[Edmund Dunch (Whig)|Edmund Dunch]] |years= 1708&ndash;1710 }}\n{{s-aft|after= [[Samuel Robinson (1666-1729)|Samuel Robinson]] | after2=[[Edmund Dunch (Whig)|Edmund Dunch]]}}\n{{s-end}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Vernon, James, The Younger}}\n[[Category:British MPs 1708\u20131710]]\n[[Category:English civil servants]]\n[[Category:1677 births]]\n[[Category:1756 deaths]]\n[[Category:Clerks of the Privy Council]]\n[[Category:Fellows of the Royal Society]]\n[[Category:Ambassadors of England to Denmark]]\n[[Category:Members of the Parliament of Great Britain for English constituencies]]\n[[Category:Members of Parliament for Cricklade]]\n", "text_old": "{{Use dmy dates|date=September 2017}}\n{{Use British English|date=September 2017}}\n[[File:James Vernon.jpg|thumb|James Vernon the Younger in the 1690s]]\n\n'''James Vernon the Younger''' (15 June 1677 \u2013 17 April 1756) was a British government official, courtier, diplomat and Whig politician who sat in the [[British House of Commons|House of Commons]] from 1708 to 1710.

He was educated at Utrecht in 1690, at Rotterdam from 1690 to 1692 and a Utrecht again from 1696 to 1697.<ref name = HOP>{{cite web| url = http://www.historyofparliamentonline.org/volume/1690-1715/member/vernon-james-ii-1677-1756| title=VERNON, James II (1677-1756), of Westminster, Mdx. | publisher= History of Parliament Online| accessdate = 4 June 2019 }}</ref>\n\n==Career==\nIn 1691, Vernon was appointed serjeant of the chandlery. He was appointed an extra clerk of the [[Her Majesty's Most Honourable Privy Council]] in 1697. His first parliamentary attempt was in a by-election in 1698 at [[Penryn (UK Parliament constituency)|Penryn]] when he was unsuccessful. He was groom of bedchamber to Duke of Gloucester from 1698 to 1700. From his close attendance on the Duke he contracted the illness from which the Duke died, and took several months to recover. At the second general election of 1701, he and his father contested [[St Mawes (UK Parliament constituency)|St Mawes]], but were unable to overcome the established interest. From 1701 to 1702 he was a Commissioner of the privy seal. In May 1702, he was elected a [[Fellow of the Royal Society]].<ref>{{cite web | url= http://www2.royalsociety.org/DServe/dserve.exe?dsqIni=Dserve.ini&dsqApp=Archive&dsqCmd=Show.tcl&dsqDb=Persons&dsqPos=3&dsqSearch=%28Surname%3D%27vernon%27%29 | title= Library and Archive Catalogue | publisher= Royal Society | accessdate= 29 October 2010 }}{{Dead link|date=January 2020 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> He served as [[List of Ambassadors from the United Kingdom to Denmark|British envoy to Denmark]] from 1702 to 1707<ref>[http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/catalogue/default.asp?j=1 The National Archives Catalogue], SP75/24-25</ref> and was groom of bedchamber to the Prince of Denmark from 1702 to 1708.<ref name=HOP/>\n\nAt the [[1708 British general election]] Vernon was returned as Whig [[Member of Parliament]] for [[Cricklade (UK Parliament constituency)|Cricklade]]. In early 1709 he supported the naturalization of the Palatines, and in 1710 voted for the impeachment of Dr Sacheverell, later airing his dismay that Whig leaders had made such a fuss about \u2018a factious preacher much below their notice\u2019. He became a Commissioner for excise in 1710, in compensation for his father\u2019s dismissal as teller of the Exchequer. The post, worth \u00a3800 a year, made him ineligible to stand at the [[1710 British general election]].\n\n==Later life==\nVernon disentangled himself from politics and chose to serve the Tory administration as an official. In 1713, he married Arethusa Boyle daughter of [[Charles Boyle, Lord Clifford]] of Lanesborough. When King George I came to the throne in 1714 and the Whigs were in power his Whig background served him and he not only kept his post but was also appointed a [[Clerk of the Privy Council (United Kingdom)|Clerk of the Privy Council]] in 1715, which he held for the rest of his life.<ref>[http://www.history.ac.uk/resources/office/privycounc-alpha Officeholders in modern England.]</ref> In 1716 he was again Commissioner of the Privy Seal.<ref name=HOP/> He lost his post at the Excise in 1726 after a disagreement with Walpole, but it was restored in 1728. In 1727 he succeeded his father, but his wife died in 1728.<ref name=HOP/>\n\nVernon devoted his efforts to religious and charitable works. He was a sponsor of the foundation of Georgia and a trustee for Bray\u2019s charity. His government duties kept him in London, but by 1733 he had purchased an estate at Great Thurlow, Suffolk, for \u00a315,000. Later he built workhouses for several Suffolk parishes. He died without issue on 15 or 17 April 1756, and was buried at Great Thurlow.<ref name=HOP/>\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n{{s-start}}\n{{s-dip}}\n{{s-bef|before= [[Hugh Greg]]}}\n{{s-ttl|title= [[List of Ambassadors from the United Kingdom to Denmark|British envoy to Denmark]] |years= 1702&ndash;1707 }}\n{{s-aft|after= [[Daniel Pulteney]]}}\n{{s-par|gb}}\n{{s-bef|before= [[Samuel Barker (MP for Cricklade)|Samuel Barker]] | before2=[[Edmund Dunch (Whig)|Edmund Dunch]] }}\n{{s-ttl|title= [[Member of Parliament]] for [[Cricklade (UK Parliament constituency)|Cricklade]] |with= [[Edmund Dunch (Whig)|Edmund Dunch]] |years= 1708&ndash;1710 }}\n{{s-aft|after= [[Samuel Robinson (1666-1729)|Samuel Robinson]] | after2=[[Edmund Dunch (Whig)|Edmund Dunch]]}}\n{{s-end}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Vernon, James, The Younger}}\n[[Category:British MPs 1708\u20131710]]\n[[Category:English civil servants]]\n[[Category:1677 births]]\n[[Category:1756 deaths]]\n[[Category:Clerks of the Privy Council]]\n[[Category:Fellows of the Royal Society]]\n[[Category:Ambassadors of England to Denmark]]\n[[Category:Members of the Parliament of Great Britain for English constituencies]]\n[[Category:Members of Parliament for Cricklade]]\n", "name_user": "J947", "label": "safe", "comment": "clean up,typo(s) fixed: \u2019s \u2192 's (2)", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Vernon_the_Younger"}
