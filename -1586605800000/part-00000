{"title_page": "George R. Reeves", "text_new": "[[File:Colonel_George_Robertson_Reeves_Circa_1881.jpg|thumb|George Robertson Reeves as Texas Speaker of the House Circa 1881]]'''George Robertson Reeves''' (January 3, 1826 \u2013 September 5, 1882) was a former Speaker of the House of the State of Texas and a Colonel in the Confederate States's 11th Texas Cavalry Regiment during the [[American Civil War]]. He also served as a pioneering member of [[Grayson County, Texas]] in which he also served as a Sheriff and tax collector.\n\n==Ancestry==\n\nThe Reeves family was of English ancestry with Lord Robert Ryves (birth name Reve)<ref>https://www.wikitree.com/wiki/Ryves-16</ref> (pronounced Reeves) (1490-1551), owning two primary estates, Randleston purchased in 1545 and Damory Court in [[Blandford Forum]] in 1548. George Reeves's 9th great grandfather purchased both of these properties from [[Henry VIII of England]] as a member of the King's court. Lord Ryves made his living primarily in wool and textiles and is buried at St. Peter and St. Paul Church in [[Blandford Forum]], [[Dorset]], England.<ref>https://www.wikitree.com/wiki/Space:Robert_Ryves_%28Reve%29_of_Dorset</ref> [[File:Robert_Ryves_Crypt_Marker,_Blandford,_Dorset,_England.jpg|thumb|Lord Robert Ryves Crypt Marker, St. Peter and St. Paul Church, Blandford Forum, England]]\n\nColonel Reeves's 5th great grandfather, Timothy Rives<ref>https://thereevesproject.org/data/tiki-index.php?page=Rives_Timothy_RR51ID206</ref>, immigrated from England to Virginia, USA, in the mid 1600s, and within a few generations the family would leave [[Virginia]] and move west, settling in [[Tennessee]].  Oral history of the Reeves family indicates that Colonel Reeves's father, William Steele Reeves (1794-1872), was very close to, if not partially raised by his aunt, Charlotte Reeves and her husband, General [[James Robertson (explorer)|James Robertson]]. General Robertson was commissioned as a United States military officer by President [[George Washington]] and was the co-founder of [[Fort Nashborough]] in [[Tennessee]], later named [[Nashville]]. William is listed as a family member in the James Robertson family bible.\n\n==Personal life==\n\nGeorge Robertson Reeves was born in [[Hickman County, Tennessee]]. He married Jane Moore in 1844 while living in [[Arkansas]], and between them had 12 children, with seven surviving his death in 1882. Jane Moore's grandfather was noted pioneer Colonel Robert Bean, an acquaintance of famous frontiersmen [[Daniel Boone]] and [[David Crockett]]. Jane Moore's great grandfather, Jesse Bean, was purported to have made several rifles from his black-smithing cave in Caney Hollow Branch, Franklin County, Tennessee and it is suspected that one of those rifles was used at the Battle of the Alamo and now resides in its museum. Moore's great uncle, Russell Bean, was the first white child born in what is now the state of Tennessee.\n\nGeorge Robertson Reeves donated 10 acres of land in [[Pottsboro, Texas]] to establish Georgetown Cemetery. His infant daughter, Mary, was the first to be buried there. One of Reeves's youngest sons, Alvin Robertson Reeves (1872-1946), was awarded the 1938 [[Pugsley Medal]] (Bronze) \nfor his work as the director of the Division of State Parks in [[Oklahoma]]. Alvin Reeves was responsible for drafting the bill in the State of Oklahoma establishing the State Game and Fish Commission. As state game warden, Reeves purchased the first sites later to be designated state parks in Oklahoma.\n\n==Career and accomplishments==\n\nIn addition to farming, one of Reeves first occupations in [[Grayson County, Texas]] was that of tax collector (1848-1850).  Public service suited him enough that he became the Sheriff of Grayson County, Texas in 1850 and served until 1854. [[File:Flag_of_the_11th_Texas_Cavalry.jpg|thumb|Original Flag of the Texas 11th Cavalry, Camp Reeves. Texas Civil War Museum, Ft. Worth, Texas]]  [[File:11th_Texas_Cavalry_Historical_Marker_in_Sherman,_Texas.jpg|thumb|Historical Marker to 11th Texas Cavalry, Sherman, Texas]]\n\nIn May 1861 with the first shots of the Civil War at [[Fort Sumpter]] less than a month old, Reeves organized a company within the 11th Regiment of the Texas Cavalry. Despite Grayson County voting against secession from the northern states, Texas as a whole voted to join the Confederacy. Reeves then donated land which would be used as Camp Reeves in support of the 11th Texas Cavalry and the Confederate States cause. Reeves, a Captain, was promoted to Colonel after the death of the Regiment's first Commander, William C. Young. While the 11th had a handful of commanding officers, none served the 11th as its leader longer than Colonel George R. Reeves.\n\nThe Texas 11th Cavalry during the course of the war was involved in approximately 150 battles and skirmishes. One report said that as many as 500 men fought and less than 50 returned home at the end of the war. Among the biggest battles in which Reeves commanded the 11th Cav was the [[Chattanooga Campaign]], [[Wheeler's October 1863 Raid|Wheeler's Raid]] through middle Tennessee, the [[Atlanta Campaign]], the [[Knoxville Campaign]], and the [[Battle of Chickamauga]], the last being the second bloodiest battle of the war behind only Gettysburg, and the largest battle victory for the Confederate States. The 11th Texas Cavalary, during most of its military history, reported to Reeves's good friend and fellow Texan, General [[John A. Wharton]] and up to Georgian [[Joseph Wheeler|Joseph \"Fighting Joe\" Wheeler]].\n\nReeves resigned his commission shortly before the end of the war due to conflicts with commanding officers. His resignation letter stated differences between him and his Brigade Commander and that \"I feel that I could more efficiently serve my country in some other capacity than the one I occupy now.\" His resignation was signed off by Major General Joseph Wheeler and eventually sent to the Secretary of War, [[James Seddon]].\nBack in Texas Reeves became active in various post-war veteran's activities as well as the Old Settlers' Association in Grayson County. Reeves was elected to the Texas State Legislature in 1866, 1873, 1878, and 1880. In 1881 he became the [[List of Speakers of the Texas House of Representatives|Speaker of the House of Representatives for the State of Texas]]. Under his watch as Speaker of the House, the legislature helped to found the [[University of Texas]] in Austin.\n\n==Death and legacy==\n\nIn 1882 while visiting home, Reeves was bitten by a rabid dog. Reeves family oral history states that he saw a young child in danger from the animal and jumped off his horse to protect the young one when he was bitten. In his remaining days, Reeves was placed in a wooden shed padded with mattresses to protect him from the potential self-inflicted violent tendencies associated with the disease. He died of [[Rabies|hydrophobia]] in September 1882, only three years before [[Louis Pasteur]] and [[Emile Roux]] discovered a vaccine for rabies. He is buried on the land he once owned, Georgetown Cemetery in [[Pottsboro, Texas]]. [[File:Reeves_County_Line_Marker.jpg|thumb|Highway Marker, Reeves County, Texas]]\n\nTwo years after his death, a 2,642 square mile county in West Texas was renamed for Reeves. [[Reeves County, Texas]] is the home to the city of [[Pecos, Texas]] its county seat. In addition, the [[Masonic Lodge]] in Pottsboro was named after the former politician and soldier, as is the [[Sons of Confederate Veterans]] Camp #349 in the Sherman/Denison, Texas area. \nSeveral of Colonel Reeves's relatives still live in Grayson County as well as Tyler and Dallas, Texas, Louisiana, Colorado and California.\n\n[[File:Headstone_of_George_R_Reeves,_Georgetown_Cemetery,_Pottsboro,_Texas.jpg|thumb|Headstone of George Robertson Reeves, Georgetown Cemetery, Pottsboro, Texas]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== Sources ==\n* http://www.laits.utexas.edu/txp_media/html/leg/speakers/04.html\n* https://web.archive.org/web/20120405165900/http://www.kdreeves.com/genealogy/fam2055.html\n* http://www.tshaonline.org/handbook/online/articles/fre20\n* http://www.lrl.state.tx.us/legeleaders/members/speakerElection.cfm?memberID=4224\n* http://www.angelfire.com/tx/mrcobbs/11TX.html\nState of Texas Biographical Sketches, 1879\nBiographical Souvenir of the State of Texas, Chicago, FA Battey & Company, 1889\nReliques of the Rives (Ryves), James Rives Childs, Heritage Books, 1929\nTexas Politics Project, University of Texas Austin, 2017\n{{TXSpeakers}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Reeves, George R.}}\n[[Category:Speakers of the Texas House of Representatives]]\n[[Category:1826 births]]\n[[Category:1882 deaths]]\n[[Category:19th-century American politicians]]\n", "text_old": "[[File:Colonel_George_Robertson_Reeves_Circa_1881.jpg|thumb|George Robertson Reeves as Texas Speaker of the House Circa 1881]]'''George Robertson Reeves''' (January 3, 1826 \u2013 September 5, 1882) was a former Speaker of the House of the State of Texas and a Colonel in the Confederate States's 11th Texas Cavalry Regiment during the [[American Civil War]].

While the 11th had a handful of commanding officers, none served the 11th as its leader longer than Colonel George R. Reeves.\n\nThe Texas 11th Cavalry during the course of the war was involved in approximately 150 battles and skirmishes. One report said that as many as 500 men fought and less than 50 returned home at the end of the war. Among the biggest battles in which Reeves commanded the 11th Cav was the [[Chattanooga Campaign]], [[Wheeler's October 1863 Raid|Wheeler's Raid]] through middle Tennessee, the [[Atlanta Campaign]], the [[Knoxville Campaign]], and the [[Battle of Chickamauga]], the last being the second bloodiest battle of the war behind only Gettysburg, and the largest battle victory for the Confederate States. The 11th Texas Cavalary, during most of its military history, reported to Reeves's good friend and fellow Texan, General [[John A. Wharton]] and up to Georgian [[Joseph Wheeler|Joseph \"Fighting Joe\" Wheeler]].\n\nReeves resigned his commission shortly before the end of the war due to conflicts with commanding officers. His resignation letter stated differences between him and his Brigade Commander and that \"I feel that I could more efficiently serve my country in some other capacity than the one I occupy now.\" His resignation was signed off by Major General Joseph Wheeler and eventually sent to the Secretary of War, [[James Seddon]].\nBack in Texas Reeves became active in various post-war veteran's activities as well as the Old Settlers' Association in Grayson County. Reeves was elected to the Texas State Legislature in 1866, 1873, 1878, and 1880. In 1881 he became the [[List of Speakers of the Texas House of Representatives|Speaker of the House of Representatives for the State of Texas]]. Under his watch as Speaker of the House, the legislature helped to found the [[University of Texas]] in Austin.\n\n==Death and legacy==\n\nIn 1882 while visiting home, Reeves was bitten by a rabid dog. Reeves family oral history states that he saw a young child in danger from the animal and jumped off his horse to protect the young one when he was bitten. In his remaining days, Reeves was placed in a wooden shed padded with mattresses to protect him from the potential self-inflicted violent tendencies associated with the disease. He died of [[Rabies|hydrophobia]] in September 1882, only three years before [[Louis Pasteur]] and [[Emile Roux]] discovered a vaccine for rabies. He is buried on the land he once owned, Georgetown Cemetery in [[Pottsboro, Texas]]. [[File:Reeves_County_Line_Marker.jpg|thumb|Highway Marker, Reeves County, Texas]]\n\nTwo years after his death, a 2,642 square mile county in West Texas was renamed for Reeves. [[Reeves County, Texas]] is the home to the city of [[Pecos, Texas]] its county seat. In addition, the [[Masonic Lodge]] in Pottsboro was named after the former politician and soldier, as is the [[Sons of Confederate Veterans]] Camp #349 in the Sherman/Denison, Texas area. \nSeveral of Colonel Reeves's relatives still live in Grayson County as well as Tyler and Dallas, Texas, Louisiana, Colorado and California.\n\n[[File:Headstone_of_George_R_Reeves,_Georgetown_Cemetery,_Pottsboro,_Texas.jpg|thumb|Headstone of George Robertson Reeves, Georgetown Cemetery, Pottsboro, Texas]]\n\n== Sources ==\n* http://www.laits.utexas.edu/txp_media/html/leg/speakers/04.html\n* https://web.archive.org/web/20120405165900/http://www.kdreeves.com/genealogy/fam2055.html\n* http://www.tshaonline.org/handbook/online/articles/fre20\n* http://www.lrl.state.tx.us/legeleaders/members/speakerElection.cfm?memberID=4224\n* http://www.angelfire.com/tx/mrcobbs/11TX.html\nState of Texas Biographical Sketches, 1879\nBiographical Souvenir of the State of Texas, Chicago, FA Battey & Company, 1889\nReliques of the Rives (Ryves), James Rives Childs, Heritage Books, 1929\nTexas Politics Project, University of Texas Austin, 2017\n{{TXSpeakers}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Reeves, George R.}}\n[[Category:Speakers of the Texas House of Representatives]]\n[[Category:1826 births]]\n[[Category:1882 deaths]]\n[[Category:19th-century American politicians]]\n", "name_user": "G\u00fcnniX", "label": "safe", "comment": "Reflist", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_R._Reeves"}

She was signed on Ivory Records together with her bandmates Chin Alcantara and Mike Manahan. It was the trio of Alcantara, Fernandez and percussionist Mike Manahan that established the beachhead for M.Y.M.P.\u2019s frontal assault on the sales and radio charts.\n\nTheir recording career started when Raymond Ryan, the station manager of iFM, watched their gig. Ryan met with a producer to produce their debut album, ''[[Soulful Acoustic]]''. Ivory Records then became their recording company. M.Y.M.P.'s debut album was released on Ivory Music and Video's 20th anniversary. The band became famous with their original hit song \"A Little Bit\" (which won the People's Choice \"Favorite Song\" Award in Awit Awards 2004) and [[cover version]]s of [[Sting (musician)|Sting]]'s \"[[Every Little Thing She Does Is Magic|Every Little Thing]]\" and [[Bob Marley]]'s \"[[Waiting in Vain]]\".\n\nThe trio did click but M.Y.M.P. became a duo when one of their members decided to leave the group. Manahan left the band in 2003 due to what was called \"professional differences\".\n\nAlcantara and Fernandez continued as a duo and emerged together with Andrew and John as bassist and kahonista, respectively, as two more albums were released in a year. ''[[Beyond Acoustic]]'' and ''[[Versions (MYMP album)|Versions]]'', both 12-track albums, were declared certified Gold after less than a month.Their original hit song \"Get Me\", and covers \"[[Tell Me Where It Hurts (Milli Vanilli song)|Tell Me Where It Hurts]]\", \"Kailan\", \"[[Especially for You]]\" and \"[[Eternal Flame (song)|Eternal Flame]]\", were later used as theme songs for TV series and commercial ads.\n\nIn early 2009, [[MYMP]] were regularly seen every Sunday on [[ABS-CBN]]'s variety show ''[[ASAP (variety show)|ASAP]]''{{'}}s \"Sessionistas\" segment together with [[Nina Girado|Nina]], [[Aiza Seguerra]], [[Sitti Navarro|Sitti]], [[Richard Poon]] and Duncan Ramos.
