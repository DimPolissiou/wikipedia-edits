The [[lagoon]] is entirely enclosed by land, however it is connected to the sea by underground channels, and is quite salty.\n\nThe island is chiefly notable for its mysterious prehistoric [[ruins]], its once-extensive deposits of phosphatic [[guano]] (exploited by Australian interests from {{circa}} 1860\u20131927), its former use as the site of the first British [[H-bomb]] tests ([[Operation Grapple]], 1957), and its current importance as a protected area for breeding seabirds.\n\nThe island is designated as the ''Malden Island Wildlife Sanctuary''.<ref name=\"IRD\">{{cite web| last = Edward R.

The nearest land is uninhabited [[Starbuck Island]], {{convert|110|nmi|km mi|0}} to the southwest. The closest inhabited place is [[Tongareva atoll|Tongareva]] (Penrhyn Island), {{convert|243|nmi|km mi|0}} to the southwest. The nearest airport is on Kiritimati ([[Kiritimati|Christmas Island]]), {{convert|365|nmi|km mi|0}} to the northwest. Other nearby islands (all uninhabited) include [[Jarvis Island]], {{convert|373|nmi|km mi|0}} to the northwest, [[Vostok Island]], {{convert|385|nmi|km mi|0}} to the south-southeast, and [[Caroline Island|Caroline (Millennium) Island]], {{convert|460|nmi|km mi|0}} to the southeast.\n\nThe island has roughly the shape of an equilateral triangle, with {{convert|8|km|mi|0|abbr=on}} on a side, aligned with the southwest side running northwest to southeast. The west and south corners are slightly truncated, shortening the north, east and southwest coasts to about {{convert|7|km|mi|0|abbr=on}}, and adding shorter west and south coasts about 1 to 2&nbsp;km (\u00bd\u20131&nbsp;mi) in length. A large, mostly shallow, irregularly shaped lagoon, containing a number of small islets, fills the east central part of the island. The [[lagoon]] is entirely enclosed by land, but only by relatively narrow strips along its north and east sides.  It is connected to the sea by underground channels, and is quite salty. Most of the land area of the island lies to the south and west of the lagoon. The total area of the island is about {{convert|39.3|km2|sqmi|0}}.\n\nThe island is very low, no more than {{convert|10|m|ft}} above sea level at its highest point.

Before the American company could begin their operations, the island was occupied by an [[Australia]]n company under British licence. This company and its successors exploited the island continuously from the 1860s through 1927.\n\nWriter [[Beatrice Grimshaw]], a visitor to Malden in the guano-digging era, decried the \"glaring barrenness of the bit island\",<ref>Grimshaw, Beatrice (1908).

For those who live on the island, it is the scene of an exile which has to be endured somehow or other\".  She described Malden as containing \"a little settlement fronted by a big wooden pier, and a desolate plain of low greyish-green herbage, relieved here and there by small bushes bearing insignificant yellow flowers\".  Water for settlers was produced by large distillation plants, since no fresh-water wells could be successfully dug on the island.<ref name=\"Living Archipelagos: Malden Island\"/>\n\nThe five or six European supervisors on the island were given \"a row of little tin-roofed, one-storeyed houses above the beach\", while the native labourers from [[Niue|Niue Island]] and [[Aitutaki]]<ref name=\"Malden Island\"/> were housed in \"big, barn-like shelters\". Grimshaw described these edifices as being \"large, bare, shady buildings fitted with wide shelves, on which the men spread their mats and pillows to sleep\". Their food consisted of \"rice, biscuits, yams, tinned beef, and tea, with a few cocoanuts for those who may fall sick\". Food for the white supervisors consisted of \"tinned food of various kinds, also bread, rice, fowls, pork, goat, and goat's milk\", but vegetables were hard to come by.\n\nIndentured labourers on Malden were contracted for one year, paid ten shillings per week plus room and board, and repatriated to their home islands when their contracts expired. Salaries for the supervisors were described as \"quite high\".<ref name=\"Grimshaw, 1908\">Grimshaw, 1908.</ref>  Work hours were 5&nbsp;am to 5&nbsp;pm, with one hour and 45 minutes given off for meals.\n\nThe guano diggers constructed a unique railroad on Malden Island, with cars powered by large sails.  Laborers pushed empty carts from the loading area up the tramway to the digging pits, where they were then loaded with guano.  At the end of the day, the sails were unfurled, and the train cars whisked back to the settlement by the prevailing southeastern winds.  While cars were known to jump the tracks more than once during these excursions, the system seems to have worked fairly well.<ref name=\"Grimshaw, 1908\"/>  Railroad handcars were also used.  This tramway remained in use on Malden as late as 1924, and its roadbed still exists on the island today.\n\nAlthough guano digging continued on Malden through the early 1920s, all human activity on the island had ceased by the early 1930s.<ref name=\"Malden Island\"/> No further human use seems to have been made of Malden until 1956.\n\n===British nuclear testing===\n[[File:Memorial tablet in Paisley.jpg  |thumb|Memorial tablet in [[Paisley (Scotland)|Paisley]] remembering the people concerned in the tests]]\nIn 1956 the [[United Kingdom]] selected Malden as the \"instrumentation site\" for its [[Operation Grapple|first series of thermonuclear (H-bomb) weapons tests]], based at Kiritimati ([[Kiritimati|Christmas Island]]). British officials insisted that Malden should not be called a \"target island\". Nevertheless, the bombing target marker was located at the south point of the island and three thermonuclear devices were detonated at high altitude a short distance offshore in 1957. The airstrip constructed on the island by the [[Royal Engineers]] in 1956\u201357 remained usable in July 1979.<ref name=\"unep-wcmc.org\"/>\n\n===Malden Island today===\nMalden was incorporated in the British [[Gilbert and Ellice Islands]] Colony in 1972, and included in the portion of the colony which became the Republic of Kiribati in 1979. The U.S. continued to dispute British sovereignty, based on its nineteenth century [[Guano Act]] claims, until after Kiribati became independent. On 20 September 1979, representatives of the United States and Kiribati met on [[Tarawa Atoll]] in the Gilberts group of [[Kiribati]], and signed a treaty of friendship between their two nations (commonly referred to as the [[Treaty of Tarawa]] of 1979) by which the United States recognized Kiribati's sovereignty over Malden and thirteen other islands in the Line and [[Phoenix Islands]] groups. This treaty entered into force on 23 September 1983.<ref name = TreatyOfTarawa>{{cite web| url = http://www.trussel.com/kir/treaty.htm| title = Treaty of friendship between the United States of America and the Republic of Kiribati| quote = Advise and consent to ratification by the Senate June 21, 1983;| accessdate = 2013-06-08}}</ref>\n\nThe main value of the island to Kiribati lies in the resources of the {{convert|200|nmi|mi km|adj=on}} [[Exclusive Economic Zone]] which surrounds it, particularly the rich [[tuna]] fisheries.

A fire in 1977, possibly caused by visitors, threatened breeding seabirds; this remains a potential threat, particularly during periods of drought.

This company and its successors exploited the island continuously from the 1860s through 1927.\n\nWriter [[Beatrice Grimshaw]], a visitor to Malden in the guano-digging era, decried the \"glaring barrenness of the bit island\",<ref>Grimshaw, Beatrice (1908). [http://www.janesoceania.com/about_malden_island/index.htm ''In the Strange South Seas''.] Retrieved on 7 July 2008.  Contains a fascinating account of a journey to Malden Island during the guano-digging era.</ref> declaring that \"...shade, coolness, refreshing fruit, pleasant sights and sounds: there are none. For those who live on the island, it is the scene of an exile which has to be endured somehow or other\".  She described Malden as containing \"a little settlement fronted by a big wooden pier, and a desolate plain of low greyish-green herbage, relieved here and there by small bushes bearing insignificant yellow flowers\".  Water for settlers was produced by large distillation plants, since no fresh-water wells could be successfully dug on the island.<ref name=\"Living Archipelagos: Malden Island\"/>\n\nThe five or six European supervisors on the island were given \"a row of little tin-roofed, one-storeyed houses above the beach\", while the native labourers from [[Niue|Niue Island]] and [[Aitutaki]]<ref name=\"Malden Island\"/> were housed in \"big, barn-like shelters\". Grimshaw described these edifices as being \"large, bare, shady buildings fitted with wide shelves, on which the men spread their mats and pillows to sleep\". Their food consisted of \"rice, biscuits, yams, tinned beef, and tea, with a few cocoanuts for those who may fall sick\". Food for the white supervisors consisted of \"tinned food of various kinds, also bread, rice, fowls, pork, goat, and goat's milk\", but vegetables were hard to come by.\n\nIndentured labourers on Malden were contracted for one year, paid ten shillings per week plus room and board, and repatriated to their home islands when their contracts expired. Salaries for the supervisors were described as \"quite high\".<ref name=\"Grimshaw, 1908\">Grimshaw, 1908.</ref>  Work hours were 5&nbsp;am to 5&nbsp;pm, with one hour and 45 minutes given off for meals.\n\nThe guano diggers constructed a unique railroad on Malden Island, with cars powered by large sails.  Laborers pushed empty carts from the loading area up the tramway to the digging pits, where they were then loaded with guano.  At the end of the day, the sails were unfurled, and the train cars whisked back to the settlement by the prevailing southeastern winds.  While cars were known to jump the tracks more than once during these excursions, the system seems to have worked fairly well.<ref name=\"Grimshaw, 1908\"/>  Railroad handcars were also used.  This tramway remained in use on Malden as late as 1924, and its roadbed still exists on the island today.\n\nAlthough guano digging continued on Malden through the early 1920s, all human activity on the island had ceased by the early 1930s.<ref name=\"Malden Island\"/> No further human use seems to have been made of Malden until 1956.\n\n===British nuclear testing===\n[[File:Memorial tablet in Paisley.jpg  |thumb|Memorial tablet in [[Paisley (Scotland)|Paisley]] remembering the people concerned in the tests]]\nIn 1956 the [[United Kingdom]] selected Malden as the \"instrumentation site\" for its [[Operation Grapple|first series of thermonuclear (H-bomb) weapons tests]], based at Kiritimati ([[Kiritimati|Christmas Island]]). British officials insisted that Malden should not be called a \"target island\". Nevertheless, the bombing target marker was located at the south point of the island and three thermonuclear devices were detonated at high altitude a short distance offshore in 1957. The airstrip constructed on the island by the [[Royal Engineers]] in 1956\u201357 remained usable in July 1979.<ref name=\"unep-wcmc.org\"/>\n\n===Malden Island today===\nMalden was incorporated in the British [[Gilbert and Ellice Islands]] Colony in 1972, and included in the portion of the colony which became the Republic of Kiribati in 1979. The U.S. continued to dispute British sovereignty, based on its nineteenth century [[Guano Act]] claims, until after Kiribati became independent. On 20 September 1979, representatives of the United States and Kiribati met on [[Tarawa Atoll]] in the Gilberts group of [[Kiribati]], and signed a treaty of friendship between their two nations (commonly referred to as the [[Treaty of Tarawa]] of 1979) by which the United States recognized Kiribati's sovereignty over Malden and thirteen other islands in the Line and [[Phoenix Islands]] groups. This treaty entered into force on 23 September 1983.<ref name = TreatyOfTarawa>{{cite web| url = http://www.trussel.com/kir/treaty.htm| title = Treaty of friendship between the United States of America and the Republic of Kiribati| quote = Advise and consent to ratification by the Senate June 21, 1983;| accessdate = 2013-06-08}}</ref>\n\nThe main value of the island to Kiribati lies in the resources of the {{convert|200|nmi|mi km|adj=on}} [[Exclusive Economic Zone]] which surrounds it, particularly the rich [[tuna]] fisheries. [[Gypsum]] deposits on the island itself are extensive, but do not appear to be economically viable under foreseeable market conditions, mainly due to cost of transportation.<ref name=\"Z0\"/> Some revenue has been realized from [[ecotourism]]; the ''World Discoverer'', an adventure cruise ship operated by ''Society Expeditions'', visited the island once or twice annually for several years in the mid-1990s.\n\nMalden was reserved as a [[Nature reserve|wildlife sanctuary]] and closed area, and was officially designated as the \"Malden Island Wildlife Sanctuary\", on 29 May 1975, under the 1975 Wildlife Conservation Ordinance.<ref name=\"Paine 1991\">{{cite book| last = Paine | first = James R.| authorlink = | title = IUCN Directory of Protected Areas in Oceania | publisher = World Conservation Union| series = | year = 1991 | url = | isbn = 978-0-8248-1217-1}}</ref> The principal purpose of this reservation was to protect the large breeding populations of seabirds. This sanctuary is administered by the Wildlife Conservation Unit of the Ministry of Line and Phoenix Islands Development, headquartered on [[Kiritimati]].<ref name=\"Paine 1991\"/> There is no resident staff at Malden, however, and occasional visits by foreign yachtsmen and fishermen cannot be monitored from Kiritimati. A fire in 1977, possibly caused by visitors, threatened breeding seabirds; this remains a potential threat, particularly during periods of drought. Later in the 2000s a Russian Businessman bought the island to build \"the Russian Empire\" in Africa.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==Sources==\n* Dunmore, John (1992); ''Who's Who in Pacific Navigation'', Australia:Melbourne University Press, {{ISBN|0-522-84488-X}}\n* Quanchi, Max & Robson, John, (2005); ''Historical Dictionary of the Discovery and Exploration of the Pacific Islands'', USA: Scarecrow Press, {{ISBN|0-8108-5395-7}}\n* [[Andrew Bloxam|Bloxam, Andrew]] (1925), ''Diary of Andrew Bloxam: naturalist of the \"Blonde\" on her trip from England to the Hawaiian islands, 1824\u201325'' Volume 10 of Bernice P.

Written by Lowe and Gomm while the pair were in [[Brinsley Schwarz]], the song was saved on a demo until [[Columbia Records]] convinced Lowe to release it. Musically the song was inspired by \"[[The Love I Lost]]\" by [[Harold Melvin & the Blue Notes]], an influence reflected in more recent performances of the song.\n\nReleased as a single in 1979, cover art by Antoinette Laumer Sales , cover photograph of Nick Lowe by Greg Irvine, the song peaked at number 12 on both the UK and [[United States|US]] charts that summer.<ref>{{cite web|title=Nick Lowe, \"Cruel to be Kind\" Chart Positions|url=http://musicvf.com/song.php?

Lowe stated, \"I wrote that when I was with a band, Brinsley Schwarz, that I was with from the early '70s to about the mid-'70s. ... We recorded it on a demo, it never came out, and when I signed to Columbia Records the A&R man [Gregg Geller] there at the time suggested I record it again. And I didn't think it would do anything, but he kind of bullied me into it.\"<ref name=\"Daily Cut\">{{cite web|title=The Daily Cut: Nick Lowe \"Cruel to Be Kind\"|url=http://wncx.cbslocal.com/2017/03/24/the-daily-cut-nick-lowe-cruel-to-be-kind-2/?e=oaes2NukQwDfVw|website=98.5 WNCX|publisher=CBS|accessdate=25 March 2017|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170326051421/http://wncx.cbslocal.com/2017/03/24/the-daily-cut-nick-lowe-cruel-to-be-kind-2/?e=oaes2NukQwDfVw |archivedate= 26 March 2017}}</ref>\n\nMusically, the song was originally closer to a soul style. Lowe later said, \u201cInitially... the inspiration was a song I loved by [[Harold Melvin & the Blue Notes]] called, '[[The Love I Lost]]', and the bass line was the same... we loved that Philly disco stuff from the 70's, The O'Jays, all that stuff, we loved that... I can't really remember much about recording it. It was just another tune that we did, you know, and I sent it over to New York to Gregg and said, Uhh, will this do?{{'\"}}<ref name=\"Speakeasy\">{{cite interview|title=Speakeasy: Nick Lowe|publisher=Front and Center Entertainment}}</ref> In more recent live versions, Lowe has performed the song closer to \"The Love I Lost\"; he explained, \"How I do it now sounds quite different. In fact, it was on the radio the other day and I was quite amazed how differently I do it now\".<ref name=\"gq\">{{cite web |last1=gq.com |title=The Survivors: Nick Lowe |url=https://www.gq.com/story/nick-lowe-gq-music-issue |website=GQ |publisher=Cond\u00e9 Nast |accessdate=13 March 2019 }}</ref>\n\n\"Cruel to Be Kind\" proved to be Lowe's most successful American single. Lowe reflected on this, \"When I had my couple of hits, I sort of felt like I was ticking a box more than, 'Great, I'm off now on a chart-topping career.' I felt that in order to do what I wanted to do, I had to do certain things, and one of them was to have a hit in my own right. At least one. I managed two or three, if you take in Europe. But in the United States, where it really matters, I had one hit and people still remember it, and it's a pretty good little song, you know?\"<ref name=\"gq\" /> Lowe continues to perform the song live and still looks favorably upon the song, saying, \"I really love it. It cheers people up. ... If they're good songs, they really will stand the test of time\".<ref name=\"gq\" />\n\n==Release history==\nThe song was originally written and recorded for the final [[Brinsley Schwarz]] album, ''It\u2019s All Over Now'', which was never officially released.\n\nThis version was eventually issued as the non-album [[A-side and B-side|B-side]] of Lowe's \"Little Hitler\" single, culled from his first solo album in 1978, ''[[Jesus of Cool]]'' (retitled ''Pure Pop for Now People'' in the US). This is now known as the \"original version,\" as compiled on Lowe\u2019s 1999 box set ''The Doings: The Solo Years'' and the 2008 expanded reissue of ''Jesus of Cool'', as well as a bootleg entitled ''It's All Over Now'', based on the unreleased album of the same title.\n\nThe song was then re-recorded with [[Rockpile]] and appeared on Lowe's second album ''[[Labour of Lust]]'' in 1979. It was released as a single on the [[Radar Records]] label in the UK and [[Columbia Records]] in the United States, charting at number 12 in both countries.\n\nThe single was backed with the non-album Lowe solo song \"Endless Grey Ribbon,\" which Lowe had originally composed for fellow Rockpile member Dave Edmunds, as referred to in the [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]] documentary ''Born Fighters''. Lowe included the ''Labour of Lust'' version of the song on both the 1984 [[12-inch single|12\" single]] of \"Half a Boy and Half a Man,\" from his album ''Nick Lowe and his Cowboy Outfit'', as well as the EP version of his single \"All Men Are Liars,\" from 1990\u2019s ''Party of One''. It also appears on the 2010 \"soundtrack\" album \"inspired\" by the 2006 motion picture ''[[The Ant Bully (film)|The Ant Bully]]''. Live versions of the song appear on Lowe\u2019s 1998 EP \"You Inspire Me,\" from his ''Dig My Mood'' album, and on the 2004 live album ''Untouched Takeaway''.\n\nThe ''Labour of Lust'' version of \"Cruel to Be Kind\" has been included on many compilations of Nick Lowe\u2019s work, including 1985's ''16 All Time Lowes'', 1990's ''Basher: The Best of Nick Lowe'', 1999's ''The Doings: The Solo Years'', 2002's ''Anthology'' and 2009's ''Quiet Please... The New Best of Nick Lowe''. It has also been included on many various artists compilations of hits of the 70s, such as ''Poptopia! 70's Power Pop Classics''.\n\n==Music video==\nThe video to the song was one of the [[first music videos aired on MTV]], and is a combination of actual footage of Lowe's wedding to [[Carlene Carter]],<ref name=\"st nick\">{{cite web |last1=Binelli |first1=Mark |title=St. Nick: The Long, Strange and Wonderful Career of Nick Lowe |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-features/long-strange-wonderful-career-nick-lowe-755373/ |website=Rolling Stone |publisher=Jann Wenner |accessdate=13 March 2019}}</ref> as well as a humorous re-enactment of the wedding, featuring Carter as herself, [[Dave Edmunds]] as their limo driver,<ref name=\"st nick\" /> [[Terry Williams (drummer)|Terry Williams]] as the photographer, [[Billy Bremner (musician)|Billy Bremner]] as the baker, and [[Jake Riviera]] (Nick's manager at the time) as the best man. The wedding took place on August 18, 1979, at the Tropicana Motel in West Hollywood. All family stayed there for the wedding and reception (also featured in the video). Filming for the video took so long that Lowe was actually late to the wedding.\n\n==Chart performance==\n{{col-begin}}\n{{col-2}}\n\n===Weekly charts===\n{|class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n!Chart (1979)\n!Peak<br>position\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"|Australia ([[Kent Music Report]])<ref>{{cite book|last=Kent|first=David|authorlink=David Kent (historian)|title=Australian Chart Book 1970\u20131992|edition=illustrated|publisher=Australian Chart Book|location=St Ives, N.S.W.|year=1993|isbn=0-646-11917-6|page=182}}</ref>\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|12\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"|Canada [[RPM (magazine)|''RPM'']]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bac-lac.gc.ca/eng/discover/films-videos-sound-recordings/rpm/Pages/image.aspx?Image=nlc008388.6862a&URLjpg=http%3a%2f%2fwww.collectionscanada.gc.ca%2fobj%2f028020%2ff4%2fnlc008388.6862a.gif&Ecopy=nlc008388.6862a |title=Image : RPM Weekly - Library and Archives Canada |website=Bac-lac.gc.ca |date= |accessdate=14 October 2016}}</ref>\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|12\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"|Ireland ([[Irish Singles Chart|IRMA]])<ref>{{cite web|url=https://i.imgur.com/QWZQhYp.jpg|title=The Irish Charts - All there is to know > Search results for 'Nick Lowe' (from irishcharts.ie)|publisher=Fireball Media, via Imgur.com|accessdate=9 December 2019}}</ref>\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|19\n|-\n{{singlechart|New Zealand|34|artist=Nick Lowe|song=Cruel to Be Kind|rowheader=true|accessdate=9 December 2019}}\n|-\n{{singlechart|UK|12|date=19790930|rowheader=true|accessdate=9 December 2019}}\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"|U.S. ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' [[Billboard Hot 100|Hot 100]]<ref>{{cite magazine|url=https://www.billboard.com/music/nick-lowe/chart-history/HSI|title=Billboard > Nick Lowe Chart History > Hot 100|magazine=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]|accessdate=9 December 2019}}</ref>\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|12\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"|U.S. ''[[Cashbox (magazine)|Cash Box]]'' Top 100<ref>[http://50.6.195.142/archives/70s_files/19791020.html] {{dead link|date=October 2016}}</ref>\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|12\n|}\n{{col-2}}\n\n===Year-end charts===\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!align=\"left\"|Chart (1979)\n! style=\"text-align:center;\"|Rank\n|-\n|Australia (Kent Music Report)<ref>{{cite web|url=https://i.imgur.com/VVyraDN.jpg|title=Kent Music Report No 288 \u2013 31 December 1979 > National Top 100 Singles for 1979|publisher=[[Kent Music Report]], via Imgur.com|accessdate=9 December 2019}}</ref>\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|86\n|-\n|Canada<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.collectionscanada.gc.ca/rpm/028020-119.01-e.php?file_num=nlc008388.5502b&brws_s=&type=1&interval=50&PHPSESSID=q083u85gbve5mca7rst0usl5u4 |title=Item Display - RPM - Library and Archives Canada |website=Collectionscanada.gc.ca |accessdate=2016-10-14 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160817091314/http://www.collectionscanada.gc.ca/rpm/028020-119.01-e.php?file_num=nlc008388.5502b&brws_s=&type=1&interval=50&PHPSESSID=q083u85gbve5mca7rst0usl5u4 |archive-date=17 August 2016 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|90\n|-\n|U.S. ([[Joel Whitburn]]'s ''Pop Annual'')<ref>{{cite book |last=Whitburn |first=Joel |date=1999 |title=Pop Annual |url= |location=Menomonee Falls, Wisconsin |publisher=Record Research Inc. |page= |isbn=0-89820-142-X}}</ref>\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|87\n|-\n|U.S. ''Cash Box''\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|93\n|}\n{{col-end}}\n\n==Covers==\nThe track has been covered by many artists, notably including co-writer Ian Gomm, first on his own 1997 album ''Crazy for You'', then again in 2005 for the various artists [[tribute album]] ''Lowe Profile: A Tribute to Nick Lowe''.

Written by Lowe and Gomm while the pair were in [[Brinsley Schwarz]], the song was saved on a demo until [[Columbia Records]] convinced Lowe to release it. Musically the song was inspired by \"[[The Love I Lost]]\" by [[Harold Melvin & the Blue Notes]], an influence reflected in more recent performances of the song.\n\nReleased as a single in 1979, cover art by Antoinette Laumer Sales , cover photograph of Nick Lowe by Greg Irvine, the song peaked at number 12 on both the UK and [[United States|US]] charts that summer.<ref>{{cite web|title=Nick Lowe, \"Cruel to be Kind\" Chart Positions|url=http://musicvf.com/song.php?

Lowe stated, \"I wrote that when I was with a band, Brinsley Schwarz, that I was with from the early '70s to about the mid-'70s. ... We recorded it on a demo, it never came out, and when I signed to Columbia Records the A&R man [Gregg Geller] there at the time suggested I record it again. And I didn't think it would do anything, but he kind of bullied me into it.\"<ref name=\"Daily Cut\">{{cite web|title=The Daily Cut: Nick Lowe \"Cruel to Be Kind\"|url=http://wncx.cbslocal.com/2017/03/24/the-daily-cut-nick-lowe-cruel-to-be-kind-2/?e=oaes2NukQwDfVw|website=98.5 WNCX|publisher=CBS|accessdate=25 March 2017|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170326051421/http://wncx.cbslocal.com/2017/03/24/the-daily-cut-nick-lowe-cruel-to-be-kind-2/?e=oaes2NukQwDfVw |archivedate= 26 March 2017}}</ref>\n\nMusically, the song was originally closer to a soul style. Lowe later said, \u201cInitially... the inspiration was a song I loved by [[Harold Melvin & the Blue Notes]] called, '[[The Love I Lost]]', and the bass line was the same... we loved that Philly disco stuff from the 70's, The O'Jays, all that stuff, we loved that... I can't really remember much about recording it. It was just another tune that we did, you know, and I sent it over to New York to Gregg and said, Uhh, will this do?{{'\"}}<ref name=\"Speakeasy\">{{cite interview|title=Speakeasy: Nick Lowe|publisher=Front and Center Entertainment}}</ref> In more recent live versions, Lowe has performed the song closer to \"The Love I Lost\"; he explained, \"How I do it now sounds quite different. In fact, it was on the radio the other day and I was quite amazed how differently I do it now\".<ref name=\"gq\">{{cite web |last1=gq.com |title=The Survivors: Nick Lowe |url=https://www.gq.com/story/nick-lowe-gq-music-issue |website=GQ |publisher=Cond\u00e9 Nast |accessdate=13 March 2019 }}</ref>\n\n\"Cruel to Be Kind\" proved to be Lowe's most successful American single. Lowe reflected on this, \"When I had my couple of hits, I sort of felt like I was ticking a box more than, 'Great, I'm off now on a chart-topping career.' I felt that in order to do what I wanted to do, I had to do certain things, and one of them was to have a hit in my own right. At least one. I managed two or three, if you take in Europe. But in the United States, where it really matters, I had one hit and people still remember it, and it's a pretty good little song, you know?\"<ref name=\"gq\" /> Lowe continues to perform the song live and still looks favorably upon the song, saying, \"I really love it. It cheers people up. ... If they're good songs, they really will stand the test of time\".<ref name=\"gq\" />\n\n==Release history==\nThe song was originally written and recorded for the final [[Brinsley Schwarz]] album, ''It\u2019s All Over Now'', which was never officially released.\n\nThis version was eventually issued as the non-album [[A-side and B-side|B-side]] of Lowe's \"Little Hitler\" single, culled from his first solo album in 1978, ''[[Jesus of Cool]]'' (retitled ''Pure Pop for Now People'' in the US). This is now known as the \"original version,\" as compiled on Lowe\u2019s 1999 box set ''The Doings: The Solo Years'' and the 2008 expanded reissue of ''Jesus of Cool'', as well as a bootleg entitled ''It's All Over Now'', based on the unreleased album of the same title.\n\nThe song was then re-recorded with [[Rockpile]] and appeared on Lowe's second album ''[[Labour of Lust]]'' in 1979. It was released as a single on the [[Radar Records]] label in the UK and [[Columbia Records]] in the United States, charting at number 12 in both countries.\n\nThe single was backed with the non-album Lowe solo song \"Endless Grey Ribbon,\" which Lowe had originally composed for fellow Rockpile member Dave Edmunds, as referred to in the [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]] documentary ''Born Fighters''. Lowe included the ''Labour of Lust'' version of the song on both the 1984 [[12-inch single|12\" single]] of \"Half a Boy and Half a Man,\" from his album ''Nick Lowe and his Cowboy Outfit'', as well as the EP version of his single \"All Men Are Liars,\" from 1990\u2019s ''Party of One''. It also appears on the 2010 \"soundtrack\" album \"inspired\" by the 2006 motion picture ''[[The Ant Bully (film)|The Ant Bully]]''. Live versions of the song appear on Lowe\u2019s 1998 EP \"You Inspire Me,\" from his ''Dig My Mood'' album, and on the 2004 live album ''Untouched Takeaway''.\n\nThe ''Labour of Lust'' version of \"Cruel to Be Kind\" has been included on many compilations of Nick Lowe\u2019s work, including 1985's ''16 All Time Lowes'', 1990's ''Basher: The Best of Nick Lowe'', 1999's ''The Doings: The Solo Years'', 2002's ''Anthology'' and 2009's ''Quiet Please... The New Best of Nick Lowe''. It has also been included on many various artists compilations of hits of the 70s, such as ''Poptopia! 70's Power Pop Classics''.\n\n==Music video==\nThe video to the song was one of the [[first music videos aired on MTV]], and is a combination of actual footage of Lowe's wedding to [[Carlene Carter]],<ref name=\"st nick\">{{cite web |last1=Binelli |first1=Mark |title=St. Nick: The Long, Strange and Wonderful Career of Nick Lowe |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-features/long-strange-wonderful-career-nick-lowe-755373/ |website=Rolling Stone |publisher=Jann Wenner |accessdate=13 March 2019}}</ref> as well as a humorous re-enactment of the wedding, featuring Carter as herself, [[Dave Edmunds]] as their limo driver,<ref name=\"st nick\" /> [[Terry Williams (drummer)|Terry Williams]] as the photographer, [[Billy Bremner (musician)|Billy Bremner]] as the baker, and [[Jake Riviera]] (Nick's manager at the time) as the best man. The wedding took place on August 18, 1979, at the Tropicana Motel in West Hollywood. All family stayed there for the wedding and reception (also featured in the video). Filming for the video took so long that Lowe was actually late to the wedding.\n\n==Chart performance==\n{{col-begin}}\n{{col-2}}\n\n===Weekly charts===\n{|class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n!Chart (1979)\n!Peak<br>position\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"|Australia ([[Kent Music Report]])<ref>{{cite book|last=Kent|first=David|authorlink=David Kent (historian)|title=Australian Chart Book 1970\u20131992|edition=illustrated|publisher=Australian Chart Book|location=St Ives, N.S.W.|year=1993|isbn=0-646-11917-6|page=182}}</ref>\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|12\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"|Canada [[RPM (magazine)|''RPM'']]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bac-lac.gc.ca/eng/discover/films-videos-sound-recordings/rpm/Pages/image.aspx?Image=nlc008388.6862a&URLjpg=http%3a%2f%2fwww.collectionscanada.gc.ca%2fobj%2f028020%2ff4%2fnlc008388.6862a.gif&Ecopy=nlc008388.6862a |title=Image : RPM Weekly - Library and Archives Canada |website=Bac-lac.gc.ca |date= |accessdate=14 October 2016}}</ref>\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|12\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"|Ireland ([[Irish Singles Chart|IRMA]])<ref>{{cite web|url=https://i.imgur.com/QWZQhYp.jpg|title=The Irish Charts - All there is to know > Search results for 'Nick Lowe' (from irishcharts.ie)|publisher=Fireball Media, via Imgur.com|accessdate=9 December 2019}}</ref>\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|19\n|-\n{{singlechart|New Zealand|34|artist=Nick Lowe|song=Cruel to Be Kind|rowheader=true|accessdate=9 December 2019}}\n|-\n{{singlechart|UK|12|date=19790930|rowheader=true|accessdate=9 December 2019}}\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"|U.S. ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' [[Billboard Hot 100|Hot 100]]<ref>{{cite magazine|url=https://www.billboard.com/music/nick-lowe/chart-history/HSI|title=Billboard > Nick Lowe Chart History > Hot 100|magazine=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]|accessdate=9 December 2019}}</ref>\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|12\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"|U.S. ''[[Cashbox (magazine)|Cash Box]]'' Top 100<ref>[http://50.6.195.142/archives/70s_files/19791020.html] {{dead link|date=October 2016}}</ref>\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|12\n|}\n{{col-2}}\n\n===Year-end charts===\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!align=\"left\"|Chart (1979)\n! style=\"text-align:center;\"|Rank\n|-\n|Australia (Kent Music Report)<ref>{{cite web|url=https://i.imgur.com/VVyraDN.jpg|title=Kent Music Report No 288 \u2013 31 December 1979 > National Top 100 Singles for 1979|publisher=[[Kent Music Report]], via Imgur.com|accessdate=9 December 2019}}</ref>\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|86\n|-\n|Canada<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.collectionscanada.gc.ca/rpm/028020-119.01-e.php?file_num=nlc008388.5502b&brws_s=&type=1&interval=50&PHPSESSID=q083u85gbve5mca7rst0usl5u4 |title=Item Display - RPM - Library and Archives Canada |website=Collectionscanada.gc.ca |accessdate=2016-10-14 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160817091314/http://www.collectionscanada.gc.ca/rpm/028020-119.01-e.php?file_num=nlc008388.5502b&brws_s=&type=1&interval=50&PHPSESSID=q083u85gbve5mca7rst0usl5u4 |archive-date=17 August 2016 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|90\n|-\n|U.S. ([[Joel Whitburn]]'s ''Pop Annual'')<ref>{{cite book |last=Whitburn |first=Joel |date=1999 |title=Pop Annual |url= |location=Menomonee Falls, Wisconsin |publisher=Record Research Inc. |page= |isbn=0-89820-142-X}}</ref>\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|87\n|-\n|U.S. ''Cash Box''\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|93\n|}\n{{col-end}}\n\n==Covers==\nThe track has been covered by many artists, notably including co-writer Ian Gomm, first on his own 1997 album ''Crazy for You'', then again in 2005 for the various artists [[tribute album]] ''Lowe Profile: A Tribute to Nick Lowe''.

These associations have to be memorized one time and can be applied repeatedly to new information that needs to be memorized.<ref name=\"analysis 2\" />\n\n==Types of Peg-word Systems==\n===Rhyming Peg-word System===\nThe Rhyming peg-word system is very simple, as stated above and could look something like this:\n# Bun: Visualize an association between the first item and a bun\n# Shoe: Visualize an association between the second item and a shoe\n# Tree: Visualize an association between the third item and a tree\n# Door: Visualize an association between the fourth item and a door\n# Hive: Visualize an association between the fifth item and a bee hive\n# Bricks: Visualize an association between the sixth item and bricks\n# Heaven: Visualize an association between the seventh item and Heaven\n# Gate: Visualize an association between the eighth item and a gate\n# Wine: Visualize an association between the ninth item and wine\n# Hen: Visualize an association between the tenth item and a chicken.\n\nFor example, to remember the following grocery list of 10 items:\n# Apple: Picture an apple eating a bun\n# Butter: Picture a pad of butter melting on a shoe\n# Batteries: Picture a tree with batteries for leaves\n# Soap: Picture a door made from soap\n# Bread: Picture bees flying from a loaf of bread as if it is a hive\n# Milk: Picture a brick house with milk jugs where the bricks should be\n# Cat food: Picture an open can of cat food with angel wings and a halo\n# Lemons: Picture an elephant-sized lemon (with arms, legs and a hat) falling through a gate\n# Coffee: Picture burning your hands on a wine glass with hot coffee in it\n# Eggs: Picture an egg cracking and a hen popping out.\n\nThe next step is to link the items with some sort of dramatic action, in order to record the order in which they appear. For example:\n# After the apple eats the bun \n# it starts eating a stick of butter.\n# The butter melts into a pool, in the middle of which sprouts a tree growing batteries.\n# A door materializes in the trunk of the tree, opens, and out walks a bar of soap.\n# The soap falls over and turns into a loaf of bread around which bees start flying\n# etc etc\n\nThe less likely you are to have seen the scene in real life, the more likely it is to make a reliably retrievable impression. \n\nTo optimize efficiency, if you were memorizing a shopping list, you would memorize the items in the order in which you would encounter them at the supermarket  - the apple(s) with the lemon(s) and the butter with the milk and eggs, etc.. \n\nAn additional layer of agility could also be achieved by setting each of the above scenes in their corresponding location in the supermarket.\n\n===The Major System===\n{{Further|Major system}}\nWhile it is common to link rhyming nouns with numbers, that is by no means the only system.
