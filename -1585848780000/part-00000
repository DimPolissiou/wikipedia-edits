A 7-point underestimate in inflation could save the [[Central Bank of Argentina]] US$3 billion in inflation-indexed interest payments, while higher economic growth would cost added interest on bonds tied to GDP; hence, there is a short-run financial benefit to the government from a discrepancy between the two inflation readings in the table.<ref>[http://www.offnews.info/downloads/CERvsPBI.pdf ''Offnews'']</ref>\n\n{{quotation|Since 2007, when Guillermo Moreno, the secretary of internal trade, was sent into the statistics institute, INDEC, to tell its staff that their figures had better not show inflation shooting up, prices and the official record have parted ways.

He was the commander of torpedo bombers in the [[Attack on Pearl Harbor]] and the [[Battle of the Santa Cruz Islands]] that crippled several [[United States Navy]] (USN) battleships and sank carrier [[USS Hornet (CV-8)|''Hornet'']]. He was killed in action during the Battle of the Santa Cruz Islands.\n\n==Early career==\nShigeharu Murata entered [[Imperial Japanese Naval Academy]] in April 1927 and graduated from 58th class in November 1930. In April 1932, he completed a navy pilot training program at [[Lake Kasumigaura|Kasumigaura]] Training Naval Air Station (NAS) and was commissioned as [[Ensign (rank)|Ensign]]. He was promoted to [[Lieutenant Junior Grade]] in November 1933. In July 1934, he was assigned to [[Tateyama, Chiba|Tateyama]] (NAS) and in October 1935 to carrier ''[[Japanese aircraft carrier Kaga|Kaga]]'' . In October 1936, he served as an instructor at [[Lake Kasumigaura|Kasumigaura]] Training Naval Air Station (NAS) near [[Tokyo]] and was promoted to full [[Lieutenant (navy)|Lieutenant]] in December. In 1937, he was transferred to 13th Air Group and participated in early stages of [[Second Sino-Japanese War]]. He was also involved in [[USS Panay incident]] in 12 December 1937.\n\nIn March 1938, Lieutenant Murata was transferred to 12th Air Group and assigned as one of the flight division leaders ([[buntaich\u014d]]). There he participated in strikes on [[Hankou]] in [[Central China]]. In December, he was transferred to carrier ''[[Japanese aircraft carrier Akagi|Akagi]]'' and became flight division leader ([[buntaich\u014d]]) in torpedo bomber squadron. In June 1939, he was assigned to [[Usa, \u014cita|Usa]] NAS in [[\u014cita Prefecture]] on [[Kyushu]] and in October he began an advanced training course for torpedo attack specialization at [[Yokosuka]] NAS. In November 1940, he was appointed as an instructor at the same NAS and conducted research on torpedo attack technique in shallow waters.\n\n==Pacific War==\nIn September 1941, Lieutenant Murata was transferred to ''Akagi'' again. He was assigned as torpedo squadron leader (as [[hik\u014dtaich\u014d]]) and was promoted to [[Lieutenant Commander]]. He participated in the [[Attack on Pearl Harbor]], where commanded the torpedo bombers that crippled the battleship line. After that he participated in the [[Indian Ocean Raid]] and subsequently in the [[Battle of Midway]]. He was on board ''Akagi'' when the bomb released by Lieutenant [[Richard Halsey Best|Dick Best]] hit the carrier and set it afire.\n\nIn July 1942, Lieutenant Commander Murata was transferred to carrier ''[[Japanese aircraft carrier Sh\u014dkaku|Sh\u014dkaku]]'' and was assigned as its torpedo bomber squadron leader (as [[hik\u014dtaich\u014d]]). In late August 1942, he participated in the [[Battle of the Eastern Solomons]], however he did not see any action. According to the doctrine at that time, [[Nakajima B5N]] torpedo bombers were held in reserve for the second strike wave that would be send after [[Aichi D3A]] dive bombers would soften up the enemy fleet. The dive bomber strikes under the command of Lieutenant Commander [[Mamoru Seki]] (''Sh\u014dkaku'') and Lieutenant [[Sadamu Takahashi]] (''Zuikaku'') were launched late in the afternoon and there was no possibility to launch a second wave of torpedo bombers.\n\nIn late October 1942, Lieutenant Commander Murata participated in the [[Battle of the Santa Cruz Islands]], where he commanded the first strike wave that consisted of 21 D3A dive bombers, 20 B5N torpedo bombers and 21 [[Mitsubishi A6M Zero|A6M Zero]] fighters. Dive bombers were led by Lieutenant Sadamu Takahashi from ''Zuikaku'', while four escorting ''Sh\u014dkaku'' fighters were led by Lieutenant Miyajima Hisayoshi, eight from ''Zuikaku'' by  Lieutenant [[Ayao Shirane]] and nine from [[Japanese aircraft carrier Zuih\u014d|''Zuih\u014d'']] by Lieutenant [[Moriyasu Hidaka]]. One the way, the IJN strike force encountered a USN strike force on a reciprocal course. At that point Lieutenant Hidaka and his nine Zeros abandoned the escort duty and attacked the USN aircraft. When the rest of the strike force approached the USN fleet, Murata led an extremely well coordinated joint torpedo and dive-bombing attack that achieved three bomb and two torpedo hits on carrier [[USS Hornet (CV-8)|''Hornet'']]. The torpedo released by Murata appeared to have been among the two that hit the carrier. However, during the attack Murata's B5N was hit by anti-aircraft artillery and was destroyed in flames.\n\nHe was one of many experienced carrier pilot leaders that were lost in the battle; among them was his academy classmate Lieutenant Commander Mamoru Seki, who led the second wave strike that severely damaged ''[[USS Enterprise (CV-6)|Enterprise]]''. He was posthumously promoted by two ranks to [[Captain (naval)|Captain]] and received a special individual citation by IJN.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n; Sources\n* {{cite book \n |last=Lundstrom \n |first=John B. \n |year=2005 \n |edition=New \n |chapter= \n |title=First Team and the Guadalcanal Campaign: Naval Fighter Combat from August to November 1942\n |publisher=Naval Institute Press \n |location=Annapolis, Maryland \n |isbn=1-59114-472-8\n}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Murata, Shigeharu}}\n[[Category:1909 births]]\n[[Category:Japanese naval aviators]]\n[[Category:Imperial Japanese Navy officers]]\n[[Category:1942 deaths]]\n[[Category:Imperial Japanese Naval Academy alumni]]\n", "text_old": "{{more footnotes|date=October 2019}}\n\n{{Infobox military person\n|name= Shigeharu Murata\n|birth_date={{Birth date|df=y|1909|4|9}}\n|death_date={{death date and age|df=y|1942|10|26|1909|3|8}}\n|birth_place=[[Nagasaki Prefecture]], [[Empire of Japan]]\n|death_place=[[Solomon Islands]]\n|image=Murata Shigeharu.jpg\n|caption=\n|nickname= \n|allegiance= [[Empire of Japan]]\n|branch= [[File:Naval Ensign of Japan.svg|22x20px|border]] [[Imperial Japanese Navy Air Service]] ([[Imperial Japanese Navy|IJN]])\n|serviceyears=\n|rank= [[Captain]]\n|commands=\n|unit= ''[[Japanese aircraft carrier Kaga|Kaga]]''<br/>''[[Japanese aircraft carrier Akagi|Akagi]]''<br/>[[Japanese aircraft carrier Sh\u014dkaku|''Sh\u014dkaku'']]<br/>12th Air Group<br/>13th Air Group\n|battles='''[[World War II]]:'''<br/>[[Second Sino-Japanese War]]<br/>[[Attack on Pearl Harbor]]<br/>[[Indian Ocean Raid]]<br/>[[Battle of Midway]]<br/>[[Battle of the Eastern Solomons]]<br/>[[Battle of the Santa Cruz Islands]]<br/>[[Solomon Islands Campaign]]\n|awards= \n|laterwork=\n}}\n{{Japanese name|Murata}}\n\n{{nihongo|'''Shigeharu Murata'''|\u6751\u7530 \u91cd\u6cbb|Murata Shigeharu|}} was a [[torpedo bomber]] pilot [[Officer (armed forces)|officer]] in the [[Imperial Japanese Navy]] (IJN) during [[World War II]].

It was founded in 1994 by universities from Austria, Indonesia, Thailand and Vietnam with the goal of promoting the continuous internationalisation of education and research. Today ASEA-UNINET consists of 83 universities from 17 different countries.<ref>ASEA-UNINET Homepage ''[http://asea-uninet.org ASEA-UNINET Homepage]'', retrieved on October, 23rd 2014.</ref>\n\n== The Beginnings & Aims ==\nThe foundations for this university network were laid by informal contacts between the University of Innsbruck and various Thai Universities, which date back to the late 1970s. Official visits followed and in the 1980s first partnerships between individual universities were concluded. This included partnership agreements between the University of Innsbruck and the Universities Chulalongkorn and Mahidol in Bangkok, as well as between the Universities of Vienna and Chiang Mai, and between the University of Agricultural Sciences in Vienna and the University of Kasetsart in Bangkok. Another partnership agreement was concluded with Gadjah Mada University in Yogyakarta in 1990. In 1992 the Universities of Innsbruck, Chulalongkorn, Vienna and Chiang Mai signed a joined partnership agreement to include one another in their cooperations. University relations also developed substantially with Vietnam. Furthermore interconnections were established between Austria's partner institutions in Thailand and other countries in the region and thus the idea of ASEA-UNINET was born.<ref>ASEA-UNINET Homepage ''[http://asea-uninet.org ASEA-UNINET Homepage]'', retrieved on October, 23rd 2014.</ref><ref>Austrian Federal Ministry of Science, Research and Economy ''[http://wissenschaft.bmwfw.gv.at/bmwfw/forschung/internationales/regionale-schwerpunkte/suedostasien/ \"S\u00fcdostasien\"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141023131230/http://wissenschaft.bmwfw.gv.at/bmwfw/forschung/internationales/regionale-schwerpunkte/suedostasien/ |date=2014-10-23 }}'', retrieved on May, 23rd 2014.</ref>\n\nWith the aim to unify all these bilateral partnership agreements in one multilateral partnership, the initiator, Prof. B. M. Rode, invited interested universities in Austria, Indonesia, Thailand and Vietnam to participate in the 1st Plenary Meeting in Ho Chi Minh City in December 1994. During this meeting the infrastructure and organization of the newly founded network, was laid down jointly by the participants and the following aims were agreed upon:\n* facilitate and encourage cooperation between academic institutions in the fields of teaching, research, staff and student (e.g. joint research projects, staff and student exchange possibilities, Graduate programmes (mainly Ph.D. studies) and postgraduate education, specialized training courses).<ref>Austrian Agency for International Cooperation in Education and Research (OeAD):''[http://www.oead.at/index.php?id=420&L=1  \"Technology Grants South-East Asia\"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140715020654/http://www.oead.at/index.php?id=420&L=1 |date=2014-07-15 }}'', retrieved on July 4th, 2014.</ref>\n* promotion of scientific, cultural and human relations and personal contacts. \n* promotion and initiation of projects of mutual interest and benefit for faculties, staff and students.\n* Support and assist in forming coalitions of resources for academic activities between member institutions.\n* facilitate collaboration and cooperation in eductation between universities, governmental and non-governmental organisations and economic operators engaged in projects related to education, science, technology and art in countries with member universities.\n* act as a forum of continuous discussions on the progress of these projects, and serving as a network of excellence providing expertise and initiatives for entities seeking European-S.E.Asian relations.\n\n== Organization ==\nEach Member University has an ASEA-UNINET Coordinator, each country a National Coordinator and each continent a Regional Coordinator. The Chairman is elected at the General Assembly for approx. a 1 \u00bd year period.\n\nIn order to achieve ASEA UNINET's common goals and objectives financing is sought by all member institutions from university and national government sources. Project contributions are made by the member-universities on the basis of fair balance according to their economic and financial situation. Additional financial support is sought from regional (e.g. EU, ASEAN) as well as international agencies and from the private sector according to available projects.<ref>ASEA-UNINET Homepage ''[http://asea-uninet.org ASEA-UNINET Homepage]'', retrieved on October, 23rd 2014.</ref>\n\n== Focal Areas ==\nAlmost all areas of academic and economic interest are represented within ASEA-UNINET.<ref>ASEA-UNINET Homepage ''[http://asea-uninet.org ASEA-UNINET Homepage]'', retrieved on October, 23rd 2014.</ref> The current focus areas of cooperation include:\n* Science and Technology\n* Economic and Social Sciences\n* Health, Pharmacy and Medicine\n* Humanities, Culture and Music\n\n== Members ==\nIn 1994 this network consisted of 25 universities from Austria, Thailand, Indonesia and Vietnam. In the following years, many universities from the following countries have joined the network: Kingdom of Cambodia, Czech Republic, Germany, Greece, Italy, Malaysia, Myanmar, Philippines, Portugal, Slovakia, Spain. Pakistan and Iran have currently an associated status for specific projects. Since February 2018 ASEA-UNINET consists of 83 Universities from 17 different countries.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

It was founded in 1994 by universities from Austria, Indonesia, Thailand and Vietnam with the goal of promoting the continuous internationalisation of education and research. Today ASEA-UNINET consists of 83 universities from 17 different countries.<ref>ASEA-UNINET Homepage ''[http://asea-uninet.org ASEA-UNINET Homepage]'', retrieved on October, 23rd 2014.</ref>\n\n== The Beginnings & Aims ==\nThe foundations for this university network were laid by informal contacts between the University of Innsbruck and various Thai Universities, which date back to the late 1970s. Official visits followed and in the 1980s first partnerships between individual universities were concluded. This included partnership agreements between the University of Innsbruck and the Universities Chulalongkorn and Mahidol in Bangkok, as well as between the Universities of Vienna and Chiang Mai, and between the University of Agricultural Sciences in Vienna and the University of Kasetsart in Bangkok. Another partnership agreement was concluded with Gadjah Mada University in Yogyakarta in 1990. In 1992 the Universities of Innsbruck, Chulalongkorn, Vienna and Chiang Mai signed a joined partnership agreement to include one another in their cooperations. University relations also developed substantially with Vietnam. Furthermore interconnections were established between Austria's partner institutions in Thailand and other countries in the region and thus the idea of ASEA-UNINET was born.<ref>ASEA-UNINET Homepage ''[http://asea-uninet.org ASEA-UNINET Homepage]'', retrieved on October, 23rd 2014.</ref><ref>Austrian Federal Ministry of Science, Research and Economy ''[http://wissenschaft.bmwfw.gv.at/bmwfw/forschung/internationales/regionale-schwerpunkte/suedostasien/ \"S\u00fcdostasien\"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141023131230/http://wissenschaft.bmwfw.gv.at/bmwfw/forschung/internationales/regionale-schwerpunkte/suedostasien/ |date=2014-10-23 }}'', retrieved on May, 23rd 2014.</ref>\n\nWith the aim to unify all these bilateral partnership agreements in one multilateral partnership, the initiator, Prof. B. M. Rode, invited interested universities in Austria, Indonesia, Thailand and Vietnam to participate in the 1st Plenary Meeting in Ho Chi Minh City in December 1994. During this meeting the infrastructure and organization of the newly founded network, was laid down jointly by the participants and the following aims were agreed upon:\n* facilitate and encourage cooperation between academic institutions in the fields of teaching, research, staff and student (e.g. joint research projects, staff and student exchange possibilities, Graduate programmes (mainly Ph.D. studies) and postgraduate education, specialized training courses).<ref>Austrian Agency for International Cooperation in Education and Research (OeAD):''[http://www.oead.at/index.php?id=420&L=1  \"Technology Grants South-East Asia\"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140715020654/http://www.oead.at/index.php?id=420&L=1 |date=2014-07-15 }}'', retrieved on July 4th, 2014.</ref>\n* promotion of scientific, cultural and human relations and personal contacts. \n* promotion and initiation of projects of mutual interest and benefit for faculties, staff and students.\n* Support and assist in forming coalitions of resources for academic activities between member institutions.\n* facilitate collaboration and cooperation in eductation between universities, governmental and non-governmental organisations and economic operators engaged in projects related to education, science, technology and art in countries with member universities.\n* act as a forum of continuous discussions on the progress of these projects, and serving as a network of excellence providing expertise and initiatives for entities seeking European-S.E.Asian relations.\n\n== Organization ==\nEach Member University has an ASEA-UNINET Coordinator, each country a National Coordinator and each continent a Regional Coordinator. The Chairman is elected at the General Assembly for approx. a 1 \u00bd year period.\n\nIn order to achieve ASEA UNINET's common goals and objectives financing is sought by all member institutions from university and national government sources. Project contributions are made by the member-universities on the basis of fair balance according to their economic and financial situation. Additional financial support is sought from regional (e.g. EU, ASEAN) as well as international agencies and from the private sector according to available projects.<ref>ASEA-UNINET Homepage ''[http://asea-uninet.org ASEA-UNINET Homepage]'', retrieved on October, 23rd 2014.</ref>\n\n== Focal Areas ==\nAlmost all areas of academic and economic interest are represented within ASEA-UNINET.<ref>ASEA-UNINET Homepage ''[http://asea-uninet.org ASEA-UNINET Homepage]'', retrieved on October, 23rd 2014.</ref> The current focus areas of cooperation include:\n* Science and Technology\n* Economic and Social Sciences\n* Health, Pharmacy and Medicine\n* Humanities, Culture and Music\n\n== Members ==\nIn 1994 this network consisted of 25 universities from Austria, Thailand, Indonesia and Vietnam. In the following years, many universities from the following countries have joined the network: Kingdom of Cambodia, Czech Republic, Germany, Greece, Italy, Malaysia, Myanmar, Philippines, Portugal, Slovakia, Spain. Pakistan and Iran have currently an associated status for specific projects. Since February 2018 ASEA-UNINET consists of 83 Universities from 17 different countries.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

They often have elevated train-type doors instead of traditional [[bus doors]] to use dedicated stations. Payment is typically made at a bus station using a [[paid area|fare gate]] rather than on the bus.\n\nCompared to using multiple smaller buses on a route, challenges using a bi-articulated bus include: \n* difficulties maneuvering in traffic\n* an increased turning radius{{citation needed|date=May 2018}}\n* the need to have extended length station platforms\n* reduced frequency of service (one larger bus every 10 minutes rather than two regular sized buses coming once every 5 minutes) \n* less flexibility for scheduling, routing, and maintenance. \nHowever, an bi-articulated bus requires fewer drivers relative to the number of passengers per bus.\n\n==Early versions==\nIn the late 1980s, the French manufacturers [[Renault]] and [[Heuliez Bus]] developed the \"M\u00e9gabus\" (officially the Heuliez GX237), a bi-articulated high-floor bus. The demonstrator M\u00e9gabus visited transit agencies throughout France, but the only city to order them was [[Bordeaux]] (an order of 10 buses, built in 1989). These buses, now retired, were used on Bordeaux's bus route 7{{Citation needed|date=April 2012}} until the city's [[Tramway de Bordeaux|tram system]] opened in 2004.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://homepage.ntlworld.com/c.fuller1/GX237.html |title=French buses - the Megabus and other PR100 oddities |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071205152430/http://homepage.ntlworld.com/c.fuller1/GX237.html |archive-date=December 5, 2007 }}</ref>\n\nHungarian bus manufacturer [[Ikarus Bus|Ikarus]] also developed a bi-articulated bus prototype, the Ikarus 293, in the early 1990s.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.autobusovenoviny.cz/clanek/935/ikarus-293|title=Autobusov\u00e9 noviny :: IKARUS 293|accessdate=2010-11-12|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110718164633/http://www.autobusovenoviny.cz/clanek/935/ikarus-293|archive-date=2011-07-18|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nIn [[Bucharest]], the ITB (today the [[Societatea de Transport Bucure\u0219ti|STB]]) operated a double articulated [[trolleybus]] (unofficially called DAC 122E), made by adding a modified section between the first and the last sections of a [[Rocar DAC|DAC]] 117E articulated trolleybus, one of the sections coming from a damaged DAC 117E. This vehicle was built to fulfill the need of high capacity person transportation, which was proving difficult for the ITB in 1988, when the prototype was made. However, the DAC 117E's 125 kW traction motor proved insufficient for such a heavy vehicle, let alone the weight of passengers when it operated at full capacity. As a result, the vehicle was very slow and had trouble operating on grades, especially the incline between Ci\u0219migiu Park and University Square. It also had trouble making sharp turns and was difficult to control, especially on snow or ice. This trolleybus was operated on long lines with wide roads and no major turns except the end of the lines like 69 and 90, but occasionally entered on lines 85, 66, 79 and 86. Bucharest traffic became increasingly intense in the very late 1990s, and RATB sought shorter trolleybuses. The DAC 122E was withdrawn from regular service, being occasionally used on lines 69 and 90 until 2000 when it was fully removed from service, displaced by the then-new [[Ikarus 415T]]s and scrapped. Bucharest no longer operates bi-articulated vehicles (except for trams) due to high traffic levels, which is also the reason why between 2007 and 2018, the RATB refused to operate normal articulated buses.\n\n== Use ==\n[[File:Doppelgelenkbus 02 KMJ.jpg|thumb|A [[Van Hool]] bi-articulated bus in [[Hamburg]], Germany]]\n[[File:AutoTram Extra Grand 2013.JPG|thumb|An AutoTram Extra Grand]]\n[[File:Hess LighTram in Groningen.JPG|thumb|Bi-articulated bus is presented to the public in [[Groningen]], [[Netherlands]]]]\nA bi-articulated bus is a long vehicle and usually requires a specially trained driver, as maneuvering (particularly reversing) can be difficult. Articulated electric [[Trolleybus|trolleybuses]] can be difficult to control, with their motors producing momentary peak power in excess of 600 [[Kilowatt|kilowatts]] (816 [[Metric horsepower|PS]]; 805 [[Horsepower|hp]]). The trailer section of a \"puller\" bus can be subject to unusual [[Centripetal force|centripetal forces]], which many people can find uncomfortable, although this is not an issue with \"pushers\".\n\nThe transit system that has used bi-articulated buses the longest is the ''[[Rede Integrada de Transporte]]'', in [[Curitiba]], [[Brazil]], which provides a type of service that has come to be known \u2013 particularly in [[American English]] \u2013 as [[bus rapid transit]] (BRT), where buses run in dedicated lanes and stop only at enclosed stations.

They often have elevated train-type doors instead of traditional [[bus doors]] to use dedicated stations. Payment is typically made at a bus station using a [[paid area|fare gate]] rather than on the bus.\n\nCompared to using multiple smaller buses on a route, challenges using a bi-articulated bus include: \n* difficulties maneuvering in traffic\n* an increased turning radius{{citation needed|date=May 2018}}\n* the need to have extended length station platforms\n* reduced frequency of service (one larger bus every 10 minutes rather than two regular sized buses coming once every 5 minutes) \n* less flexibility for scheduling, routing, and maintenance. \nHowever, an bi-articulated bus requires fewer drivers relative to the number of passengers per bus.\n\n==Early versions==\nIn the late 1980s, the French manufacturers [[Renault]] and [[Heuliez Bus]] developed the \"M\u00e9gabus\" (officially the Heuliez GX237), a bi-articulated high-floor bus. The demonstrator M\u00e9gabus visited transit agencies throughout France, but the only city to order them was [[Bordeaux]] (an order of 10 buses, built in 1989). These buses, now retired, were used on Bordeaux's bus route 7{{Citation needed|date=April 2012}} until the city's [[Tramway de Bordeaux|tram system]] opened in 2004.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://homepage.ntlworld.com/c.fuller1/GX237.html |title=French buses - the Megabus and other PR100 oddities |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071205152430/http://homepage.ntlworld.com/c.fuller1/GX237.html |archive-date=December 5, 2007 }}</ref>\n\nHungarian bus manufacturer [[Ikarus Bus|Ikarus]] also developed a bi-articulated bus prototype, the Ikarus 293, in the early 1990s.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.autobusovenoviny.cz/clanek/935/ikarus-293|title=Autobusov\u00e9 noviny :: IKARUS 293|accessdate=2010-11-12|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110718164633/http://www.autobusovenoviny.cz/clanek/935/ikarus-293|archive-date=2011-07-18|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nIn [[Bucharest]], ITB (today [[Regia Autonom\u0103 de Transport Bucure\u0219ti|RATB]]) operated a double articulated [[trolleybus]] (unofficially called DAC 122E), made by adding a modified section between the first and the last sections of a [[Rocar DAC|DAC]] 117E articulated trolleybus. This vehicle was built to fulfill the need of high capacity person transportation. However, the DAC 177E's 125 kW proved insufficient for such a heavy vehicle, let alone the weight of passengers when it operated at full capacity. As a result, the vehicle was very slow and had trouble operating on grades. It also had trouble making sharp turns and was difficult to control, especially on snow or ice. This trolleybus was operated on long lines with wide roads and no major turns except the end of the lines like 69 and 90, but occasionally entered on lines 85, 66, 79 and 86. Bucharest traffic became increasingly intense in the very late 1990s, and RATB sought shorter trolleybuses. The DAC 122E was withdrawn from regular service, being occasionally used on lines 69 and 90 until the mid-to-late 2000s when it was fully removed from service and scrapped. Currently, except double articulated trams V3A and simply articulated V2A T trams, RATB operates no more articulated vehicles due to traffic levels.\n\n== Use ==\n[[File:Doppelgelenkbus 02 KMJ.jpg|thumb|A [[Van Hool]] bi-articulated bus in [[Hamburg]], Germany]]\n[[File:AutoTram Extra Grand 2013.JPG|thumb|An AutoTram Extra Grand]]\n[[File:Hess LighTram in Groningen.JPG|thumb|Bi-articulated bus is presented to the public in [[Groningen]], [[Netherlands]]]]\nA bi-articulated bus is a long vehicle and usually requires a specially trained driver, as maneuvering (particularly reversing) can be difficult.

Sears purchased them, then sold them at a low price to the station agents and made a profit. He started a mail-order watch business in Minneapolis in 1886, calling it \"R.W. Sears Watch Company.\" Within the first year, he met Alvah C. Roebuck, a watch repairman. In 1887, Sears and Roebuck relocated the business to Chicago; later that year, the R.W. Sears Watch Company published Richard Sears' first mail-order catalog, offering watches, diamonds, and jewelry. \n[[File:Julius Rosenwald 02.jpg|thumb|170px|Julius Rosenwald]]\nIn 1889 Sears sold his business for [[US$]]100,000 (${{Inflation|US|0.1|1889|r=1|fmt=c}} million today) and relocated to Iowa, intending to be a rural banker.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.britannica.com/biography/Richard-W-Sears|title=Richard W. Sears \u2013 American merchant |website=britannica.com}}</ref> Sears returned to Chicago in 1892 and established a new mail-order firm, again selling watches and jewelry, with Roebuck as his partner, operating as the A. C. Roebuck watch company. In 1893, they renamed the company to '''Sears, Roebuck & Company''' and began to diversify the product lines offered in their catalogs. \n\nBefore the Sears catalog, farmers near small rural towns usually purchased supplies\u2014often at high prices and on credit\u2014from local [[general store]]s with narrow selections of goods. Prices were negotiated, and relied on the storekeeper's estimate of a customer's creditworthiness. Sears took advantage of this by publishing catalogs offering customers a wider selection of products at clearly stated prices. \n\nBy 1894, the Sears catalog had grown to 322 pages, including many new items such as sewing machines, bicycles, [[sports equipment|sporting goods]], and automobiles (later produced, from 1905 to 1915, by [[Lincoln Motor Car Works]] of Chicago, no relation to the current [[Lincoln (automobile)|Ford line]]).<ref>Clymer, Floyd. ''Treasury of Early American Automobiles, 1877\u20131925''. (New York: Bonanza, 1950), p.90.</ref> By 1895, the company was producing a 532-page catalog. Sales were greater than $400,000 (${{Inflation|US|0.4|1893|r=1|fmt=c}} million today) in 1893 and more than $750,000 (${{Inflation|US|0.75|1895|r=1|fmt=c}} million today) two years later.<ref>[http://www.searsarchives.com/history/history1890s.htm \"Sears History \u2013 1890s.\"] ''Sears''.

Roebuck decided to quit, returning later in a publicity role. Sears offered Roebuck's half of the company to Chicago businessman [[Aaron Nusbaum]], who in turn brought in his brother-in-law [[Julius Rosenwald]], to whom Sears owed money. In August 1895, they bought Roebuck's half of the company for $75,000 (${{Inflation|US|0.075|1895|r=1|fmt=c}} million today). The company was reincorporated in Illinois with a capital stock of $150,000 (${{Inflation|US|0.15|1895|r=1|fmt=c}} million today) in August 1895. The 1895 transaction was handled by [[Albert Henry Loeb]] of Chicago law firm Loeb & Adler (now [[Arnstein & Lehr, LLP]]). Copies of the transaction documents are now displayed on the walls of the law firm.<ref>Arnstein & Lehr, The First 120 Years (2013).</ref>\n\nSears and Rosenwald got along well with each other, but not with Nusbaum; they bought him out for $1.3 million in 1903 (${{Inflation|US|1.3|1903|r=1|fmt=c}} million today).<ref>Emmet and Jeuck, ''Catalogues and Counters'' (1950) pp 47\u201353</ref> Rosenwald brought to the mail-order firm a rational management philosophy and diversified product lines: dry goods, consumer durables, drugs, hardware, furniture, and nearly anything else a farm household could desire.\n\nIn September 1904, a freight elevator carrying 10 people fell three stories at a Sears store in Chicago, killing two people and seriously injuring six others. The freight elevator was being used because the passenger elevator was out of service for repairs.<ref>{{cite web|title=Two Killed And Six Injured in Accident In Chicago Store |publisher=[[Indiana Democrat]] |date=7 September 1904 |url=http://www.gendisasters.com/illinois/15491/chicago-il-elevator-accident-sep-1904}}</ref>\n\nSales continued to grow rapidly, and the prosperity of the company and their vision for greater expansion led Sears and Rosenwald to take the company public in 1906, with a stock placement of $40 million (${{Inflation|US|0.04|1906|r=1|fmt=c}} billion today).

The complex served as corporate headquarters until 1973, when the [[Sears Tower]] was completed and served as the base of the mail-order catalog business until 1993.\n\nBy 1907, under Rosenwald's leadership as Vice President and Treasurer, annual sales of the company climbed to roughly $50 million (${{Inflation|US|0.050|1907|r=1|fmt=c}} billion today). Sears resigned the presidency in 1908 due to declining health, with Rosenwald named president and chairman of the board and taking on full control.<ref>Emmet and Jeuck, ''Catalogues and Counters'' (1950) pp 53\u201357</ref>\n\nThe company was badly hurt during [[Post\u2013World War I recession|1919\u201321 as a severe depression]] hit the nation's farms after farmers had overexpanded their holdings.

Rosenwald oversaw the design and construction of the firm's first department store, built on land within the Sears, Roebuck and Company Complex. The store opened in 1925. In 1924, Rosenwald resigned the presidency, but remained as chairman until his death in 1932; his goal was to devote more time to philanthropy.<ref>Peter M.

Rosenwald decided to shift emphasis to urban America and brought in [[Robert E. Wood]] to take charge. The first Sears retail stores were opened in conjunction with the company's mail-order offices, typically in working-class neighborhoods far from the main shopping center. Sears was a pioneer in creating department stores that catered to men as well as women, especially with lines of hardware and building materials. It de-emphasized the latest fashions in favor of practicality and durability, and allowed customers to select goods without the aid of a clerk. Its stores were oriented to motorists\u2014set apart from existing business districts amid residential areas occupied by their target audience; had ample, free, off-street parking; and communicated a clear corporate identity. In the 1930s, the company designed fully air-conditioned, \"windowless\" stores whose layout was driven wholly by merchandising concerns.<ref>Richard Longstreth, \"Sears, Roebuck and the Remaking of the Department Store, 1924\u201342,\" ''Journal of the Society of Architectural Historians'' (2006) 65#2 pp 238\u2013279</ref>\n\nFrom the 1920s to the 1950s, Sears built many urban department stores in the US, Canada and Mexico (apart from, but not far from, existing [[central business district]]s), and they overshadowed the mail-order business. Starting in the 1950s, the company expanded into suburban markets and malls in the 1960s and 1970s. In 1959, it had formed the [[Homart Development Company]] for developing malls. Many of the company's stores have undergone major renovations or replacement since the 1980s. Sears began to diversify in the 1930s, creating [[Allstate|Allstate Insurance Company]] in 1931 and placing Allstate representatives in its stores in 1934. Over the decades it established major national brands, such as [[Kenmore Appliances|Kenmore]], [[Craftsman (tools)|Craftsman]], [[Diehard (type of battery)|DieHard]], [[Silvertone (instruments)|Silvertone]], [[Supertone Records|Supertone]], and [[Toughskins]]. The company became a [[conglomerate (company)|conglomerate]] during the mid-20th century, adding [[Dean Witter]] and [[Coldwell Banker]] real estate in 1981, starting [[Prodigy (online service)|Prodigy]] as a joint venture with [[IBM]] in 1984, and introducing the [[Discover Card|Discover credit card]] in 1985.\n\nIn 1974, Sears completed the 110-story [[Willis Tower|Sears Tower]] in Chicago, which became the [[List of tallest buildings and structures in the world#Tallest buildings|world's tallest building]], a title it took from the former [[World Trade Center (1973\u20132001)|World Trade Center]] towers in New York.

In March 2009 London-based insurer [[Willis Group Holdings|Willis Group Holdings, Ltd.]], was given the building's naming rights to encourage them to occupy the building.

The company discontinued the catalog in 1993. It dismissed 50,000 workers who had filled the orders. This was before the internet became an effective tool.

However, Riggs failed to qualify for the event.\nIn 2016, Craftsman became the title sponsor of the World Racing Group, World of Outlaws Sprint car racing series.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.woosprint.com/sponsors|title=World of Outlaws Craftsman Sprint Car Series \u2013 Sponsors|publisher=}}</ref>\n\n==Employee relations==\n[[File:Sears Centro Historico.jpg|thumb|Sears building in the [[Edificio La Nacional]] building in Mexico City, across from the [[Palacio de Bellas Artes]].]]\nSears has struggled with employee relations. One notable example was the shift in 1992 from an hourly wage based on longevity to a base wage (usually between US$3.50 and US$6 per hour) and commissions ranging from 0.5% to 11%. Sears claimed the new base wage, often constituting a substantial (up to 40%) cut in pay, was done \"to be successful in this highly competitive environment\".<ref>\"600-plus Sears jobs to be cut\", ''Chicago Tribune'', February 13, 1992</ref>\n\nIn early October 2007, Sears cut commission rates for employees in select departments to anywhere from 0.5% to 4% but equalized the base wage across all Home Improvement and Electronics departments. In 2011, commission rates on non-base items were cut by 2% in the electronics department. In late 2009, the commission on sales of \"base items\" from the electronic department was cut to 1%.

Sears purchased them, then sold them at a low price to the station agents and made a profit. He started a mail-order watch business in Minneapolis in 1886, calling it \"R.W. Sears Watch Company.\" Within the first year, he met Alvah C. Roebuck, a watch repairman. In 1887, Sears and Roebuck relocated the business to Chicago; later that year, the R.W. Sears Watch Company published Richard Sears' first mail-order catalog, offering watches, diamonds, and jewelry. \n[[File:Julius Rosenwald 02.jpg|thumb|170px|Julius Rosenwald]]\nIn 1889 Sears sold his business for [[US$]]100,000 (${{Inflation|US|0.1|1889|r=1|fmt=c}} million today) and relocated to Iowa, intending to be a rural banker.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.britannica.com/biography/Richard-W-Sears|title=Richard W. Sears \u2013 American merchant |website=britannica.com}}</ref> Sears returned to Chicago in 1892 and established a new mail-order firm, again selling watches and jewelry, with Roebuck as his partner, operating as the A. C. Roebuck watch company. In 1893, they renamed the company to '''Sears, Roebuck & Company''' and began to diversify the product lines offered in their catalogs. \n\nBefore the Sears catalog, farmers near small rural towns usually purchased supplies\u2014often at high prices and on credit\u2014from local [[general store]]s with narrow selections of goods. Prices were negotiated, and relied on the storekeeper's estimate of a customer's creditworthiness. Sears took advantage of this by publishing catalogs offering customers a wider selection of products at clearly stated prices. \n\nBy 1894, the Sears catalog had grown to 322 pages, including many new items such as sewing machines, bicycles, [[sports equipment|sporting goods]], and automobiles (later produced, from 1905 to 1915, by [[Lincoln Motor Car Works]] of Chicago, no relation to the current [[Lincoln (automobile)|Ford line]]).<ref>Clymer, Floyd. ''Treasury of Early American Automobiles, 1877\u20131925''. (New York: Bonanza, 1950), p.90.</ref> By 1895, the company was producing a 532-page catalog. Sales were greater than $400,000 (${{Inflation|US|0.4|1893|r=1|fmt=c}} million today) in 1893 and more than $750,000 (${{Inflation|US|0.75|1895|r=1|fmt=c}} million today) two years later.<ref>[http://www.searsarchives.com/history/history1890s.htm \"Sears History \u2013 1890s.\"] ''Sears''.

Roebuck decided to quit, returning later in a publicity role. Sears offered Roebuck's half of the company to Chicago businessman [[Aaron Nusbaum]], who in turn brought in his brother-in-law [[Julius Rosenwald]], to whom Sears owed money. In August 1895, they bought Roebuck's half of the company for $75,000 (${{Inflation|US|0.075|1895|r=1|fmt=c}} million today). The company was reincorporated in Illinois with a capital stock of $150,000 (${{Inflation|US|0.15|1895|r=1|fmt=c}} million today) in August 1895. The 1895 transaction was handled by [[Albert Henry Loeb]] of Chicago law firm Loeb & Adler (now [[Arnstein & Lehr, LLP]]). Copies of the transaction documents are now displayed on the walls of the law firm.<ref>Arnstein & Lehr, The First 120 Years (2013).</ref>\n\nSears and Rosenwald got along well with each other, but not with Nusbaum; they bought him out for $1.3 million in 1903 (${{Inflation|US|1.3|1903|r=1|fmt=c}} million today).<ref>Emmet and Jeuck, ''Catalogues and Counters'' (1950) pp 47\u201353</ref> Rosenwald brought to the mail-order firm a rational management philosophy and diversified product lines: dry goods, consumer durables, drugs, hardware, furniture, and nearly anything else a farm household could desire.\n\nIn September 1904, a freight elevator carrying 10 people fell three stories at a Sears store in Chicago, killing two people and seriously injuring six others. The freight elevator was being used because the passenger elevator was out of service for repairs.<ref>{{cite web|title=Two Killed And Six Injured in Accident In Chicago Store |publisher=[[Indiana Democrat]] |date=7 September 1904 |url=http://www.gendisasters.com/illinois/15491/chicago-il-elevator-accident-sep-1904}}</ref>\n\nSales continued to grow rapidly, and the prosperity of the company and their vision for greater expansion led Sears and Rosenwald to take the company public in 1906, with a stock placement of $40 million (${{Inflation|US|0.04|1906|r=1|fmt=c}} billion today).

The complex served as corporate headquarters until 1973, when the [[Sears Tower]] was completed and served as the base of the mail-order catalog business until 1993.\n\nBy 1907, under Rosenwald's leadership as Vice President and Treasurer, annual sales of the company climbed to roughly $50 million (${{Inflation|US|0.050|1907|r=1|fmt=c}} billion today). Sears resigned the presidency in 1908 due to declining health, with Rosenwald named president and chairman of the board and taking on full control.<ref>Emmet and Jeuck, ''Catalogues and Counters'' (1950) pp 53\u201357</ref>\n\nThe company was badly hurt during [[Post\u2013World War I recession|1919\u201321 as a severe depression]] hit the nation's farms after farmers had overexpanded their holdings.

Rosenwald oversaw the design and construction of the firm's first department store, built on land within the Sears, Roebuck and Company Complex. The store opened in 1925. In 1924, Rosenwald resigned the presidency, but remained as chairman until his death in 1932; his goal was to devote more time to philanthropy.<ref>Peter M.

Rosenwald decided to shift emphasis to urban America and brought in [[Robert E. Wood]] to take charge. The first Sears retail stores were opened in conjunction with the company's mail-order offices, typically in working-class neighborhoods far from the main shopping center. Sears was a pioneer in creating department stores that catered to men as well as women, especially with lines of hardware and building materials. It de-emphasized the latest fashions in favor of practicality and durability, and allowed customers to select goods without the aid of a clerk. Its stores were oriented to motorists\u2014set apart from existing business districts amid residential areas occupied by their target audience; had ample, free, off-street parking; and communicated a clear corporate identity. In the 1930s, the company designed fully air-conditioned, \"windowless\" stores whose layout was driven wholly by merchandising concerns.<ref>Richard Longstreth, \"Sears, Roebuck and the Remaking of the Department Store, 1924\u201342,\" ''Journal of the Society of Architectural Historians'' (2006) 65#2 pp 238\u2013279</ref>\n\nFrom the 1920s to the 1950s, Sears built many urban department stores in the US, Canada and Mexico (apart from, but not far from, existing [[central business district]]s), and they overshadowed the mail-order business. Starting in the 1950s, the company expanded into suburban markets and malls in the 1960s and 1970s. In 1959, it had formed the [[Homart Development Company]] for developing malls. Many of the company's stores have undergone major renovations or replacement since the 1980s. Sears began to diversify in the 1930s, creating [[Allstate|Allstate Insurance Company]] in 1931 and placing Allstate representatives in its stores in 1934.

The business deal was not quite what experts in the after-market automotive industry expected. Specifically in return, Sears Roebuck became \"one of the largest shareholders\" after obtaining a 40% stake in Advance Auto Parts, and by merging their two store networks, which included Western Auto's wholesale and retail operations. More precisely, the existing store network of Advance Auto Parts, comprising 915 stores in 17 U.S. states, merged with 590 U.S.-based Parts America Stores in addition to 40 Western Auto stores in the [[Puerto Rico|Commonwealth of Puerto Rico]].\n\nIn 1997 Sears sold 85% of [[Sears (Mexico)|its Mexico affiliate]] to [[Grupo Carso]].

It sponsored the [[NASCAR]] [[Camping World Truck Series|Truck Series]], using the Craftsman brand as the title sponsor, from the series' inception in the [[1995 NASCAR SuperTruck Series presented by Craftsman]] to the [[2008 NASCAR Craftsman Truck Series|2008 season]], when the agreement ended.<ref>[http://www.kansascity.com/news/breaking_news/story/388059.html \"Craftsman Dropping Sponsorship of NASCAR Truck Series\"]. ''[[The Kansas City Star]]''. December 4, 2007.</ref> Craftsman tools remain the official tools of NASCAR. The company sponsored the television series ''[[Extreme Makeover: Home Edition]]''. It sponsors and currently has naming rights to the [[Sears Centre]], an 11,000-seat multi-purpose family entertainment, cultural and sports center, constructed in 2006 in Hoffman Estates. The company also underwrote the [[PBS]] television series ''[[Mister Rogers' Neighborhood]]'', under the name The Sears-Roebuck Foundation from the show's premiere in 1968 until 1992. It sponsored the #10 [[Gillett Evernham Motorsports]] car of Scott Riggs for the September 2, 2007, running of the [[Sharp AQUOS 500]] at [[California Speedway]] through its Sears Auto Center branch. However, Riggs failed to qualify for the event.\nIn 2016, Craftsman became the title sponsor of the World Racing Group, World of Outlaws Sprint car racing series.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.woosprint.com/sponsors|title=World of Outlaws Craftsman Sprint Car Series \u2013 Sponsors|publisher=}}</ref>\n\n==Employee relations==\n[[File:Sears Centro Historico.jpg|thumb|Sears building in the [[Edificio La Nacional]] building in Mexico City, across from the [[Palacio de Bellas Artes]].]]\nSears has struggled with employee relations. One notable example was the shift in 1992 from an hourly wage based on longevity to a base wage (usually between US$3.50 and US$6 per hour) and commissions ranging from 0.5% to 11%. Sears claimed the new base wage, often constituting a substantial (up to 40%) cut in pay, was done \"to be successful in this highly competitive environment\".<ref>\"600-plus Sears jobs to be cut\", ''Chicago Tribune'', February 13, 1992</ref>\n\nIn early October 2007, Sears cut commission rates for employees in select departments to anywhere from 0.5% to 4% but equalized the base wage across all Home Improvement and Electronics departments. In 2011, commission rates on non-base items were cut by 2% in the electronics department. In late 2009, the commission on sales of \"base items\" from the electronic department was cut to 1%. As of 2017, appliances is the only remaining department where compensation is based entirely on commission. Other departments give a base pay plus commission. In many stores, jewelry department associates receive a low base salary with 1% commission on their sales.\n\nIn March 2019, Sears claimed that it was ending life insurance benefits for an undisclosed number of its 90,000 retirees. A few months earlier the company handed out over $25 million in bonuses to executives.<ref>{{cite news |last= Folley|first=Aris|date=March 30, 2019|title=Sears cutting life insurance benefits for up to 90,000 retirees: report|url=https://thehill.com/policy/finance/436593-sears-cuts-life-insurance-benefits-for-up-to-90000-retirees|work=[[The Hill (newspaper)|The Hill]]|location= |access-date=April 3, 2019}}</ref> This key Sears Retiree Benefit was worth between $5,000 and $15,000 for most of the pool (29,000) of eligible retired employees.<ref>{{cite web |last=Mooney|first=John|date=July 30, 2019|title=Sears Retiree Benefit|url=https://choiceseniorlife.com/2019/07/what-do-you-do-when-sears-cancels-your-life-insurance-policy/ |website=ChoiceSeniorLife.com}}</ref> \n\nIn May 2019, former Sears Holdings chairman and CEO Eddie Lampert, months after purchasing the remains of Sears from the holding company, threatened not to pay out the $43 million in pension payments<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.cnn.com/2019/05/29/business/sears-severance/index.html|title=Sears' owner wants to get out of paying $43 million in severance to former employees|last=|first=|date=|work=|access-date=}}</ref> owed to 90,000 former Sears and Kmart employees and retirees.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.cbsnews.com/news/government-fears-eddie-lampert-would-wipe-out-sears-pension-plans|title=Government fears Eddie Lampert would wipe out Sears' pension plans|last=|first=|date=February 1, 2019|work=|access-date=}}</ref> A ''[[Forbes]]'' editorial pointed out that [[Steven Mnuchin]], [[Secretary of the Treasury]], was a board member of Sears Holding until 2016, and is presently one of three directors of the [[Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation]], which manages administration of pensions for defunct or bankrupt businesses.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/warrenshoulberg/2019/06/03/the-shameless-sears-world-of-eddie-lampert-continues/#296430171fd6/|title=The Shameless Sears World Of Eddie Lampert Continues|last=|first=|date=June 3, 2019|work=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" heights=\"50\">\nFile:Sears, Robuck & Co. letterhead 1907.jpg|Letterhead logo 1907\nFile:Sears logo 1966-1984.svg|Logo 1963\u201384\nFile:Sears1984.png|1984\u201394\nFile:Sears logo 1994-2004.svg|1994\u20132004 (still used in [[Sears Mexico|Mexico]])\nFile:SearsLogo.svg|2004\u201310 (2004\u201316 in Canada)\nFile:Sears logo 2010-present.svg|2010\u201320\n</gallery>\n\n<gallery mode=\"packed\">\nFile:Sears Auto Center.jpg|Sears Auto Center at [[Steeplegate Mall]] in [[Concord, New Hampshire]].
