He has released solo records under the moniker 'Masvidal' and previously led the alternative rock band [[\u00c6on Spoke]]. He is also known for having worked with the metal band, [[Death (metal band)|Death]], as a guitarist.\n\n==Early life==\n\nPaul Masvidal was born in San Juan, Puerto Rico to Cuban-American civic and business leader [[Raul Masvidal]]. Masvidal's early days were spent in the Miami area where he studied classical guitar from an early age with Carlos Molina and in college, with guitar teacher, Dave Weissbrot who became a major influence and spurred Masvidal's love of jazz, [[Steinberger|Steinberger guitars]], and Eastern philosophy. He became an initiate to [[Kriya Yoga]] in his late teens and has been a Buddhist practitioner since around 2000,. Masvidal met drummer [[Sean Reinert]] in 1984 at [[Gulliver Schools|Gulliver Academy]] and the duo began making music the day they met, eventually forming the pre-Cynic groups, Crypha and Seaweed.\n\nMasvidal talked in detail about his experiences in his early life in some posts in his Mett\u0101 Mind Journal<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.metalsucks.net/2010/04/07/metta-mind-journal-with-cynics-paul-masvidal-the-bird-outside-my-window/|title=METTA MIND JOURNAL WITH CYNIC'S PAUL MASVIDAL: \"THE BIRD OUTSIDE MY WINDOW\"|date=2010-04-07|website=MetalSucks|language=en|access-date=2020-04-09}}</ref> series, which he published on the music blog [[MetalSucks]].\n\n== Career ==\n\nCynic released four demos from 1988 through 1991, with Masvidal developing a reputation in the Florida music scene for his musicianship. In 1989, when Masvidal was in high school, he toured Mexico as a replacement guitarist for the band [[Death (metal band)|Death]] but declined an invitation to permanently join the band in order to remain committed to Cynic. This had many journalists curious at the time, since Death were emerging as an influential and popular underground act, but Masvidal stuck to his guns and claimed to firmly believe in Cynic. However, Masvidal returned to the Death fold replacing guitarist [[James Murphy (metal guitarist)|James Murphy]] for tour dates on the international ''[[Spiritual Healing (album)|Spiritual Healing]]'' tour in 1990, leading in 1991 to Masvidal and fellow Cynic member Reinert being recruited by Death to record the \"groundbreaking\" ''[[Human (Death album)|Human]]''.\u00a0 Masvidal did extensive world tours, in addition to appearing in the [[music video]] for [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7j8vUbMmOwM ''Lack of Comprehension''].\n\nIn addition, in 1991 Masvidal helped Chicago band [[Master (American band)|Master]] to record their album ''[[On the Seventh Day God Created... Master]]''. Masvidal handled all guitar duties on this album. After finishing their world tour with Death, both Masvidal and Reinert returned to Cynic in 1992.\n\n1993 saw the release of [[Focus (Cynic album)|''Focus'']] on the [[Roadrunner Records|Roadrunner]] label, the only album Cynic recorded until 2008. Roadrunner released a reissue of ''Focus'' in 2004 as a special collector's edition due to high demand. Masvidal also recorded the Cynic spin-off Portal, but by 2007 Cynic returned to touring, featuring Masvidal and Reinert.\n\nCynic took a hiatus in 1995 after record ''The Portal Tapes'' demos and Masvidal moved to Los Angeles in the fall of 1996, upon being offered a full scholarship at [[Musicians Institute]]. During Cynic's hiatus, Masvidal founded \u00c6on Spoke, whose ethereal indie rock was heralded as \"beautiful, exquisite [and] destined for greatness\" by Janice Long, BBC Radio. In 2004, the band received airplay on BBC Radio 2 and XFM for the single ''Silence''. The following year, the track \"Emmanuel\" appeared in the indie breakout film, ''[[What the Bleep Do We Know!?]]'' \u00c6on Spoke songs have also appeared on the Warner Bros. television series ''[[Smallville]]'', ''[[One Tree Hill (TV series)|One Tree Hill]]'' and the motion picture ''[[Cry Wolf (2005 film)|Cry Wolf]]''. \u00a0Their self-titled debut LP was released in 2007 on SPV Records.\n\nCynic reunited in 2008 after a 13-year break to record ''Traced In Air'', their comeback opus. In his review<ref>{{Cite news|last=Times|first=The New York|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/12/01/arts/music/01choi.html|title=New CDs|date=2008-11-30|work=The New York Times|access-date=2020-04-09|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}</ref>, ''New York Times'' music critic Ben Ratliff wrote that Cynic \"should be understood not so much alongside any metal bands but along with the radical harmonic progressives in the last 45 years of pop and jazz: composers like Milton Nascimento, the Beach Boys or Pat Metheny.\"\n\nSince Traced In Air, Cynic has released two conceptual records: ''Re-Traced'' (2010), featuring re-interpretations of several ''Traced in Air'' tracks, and ''Carbon-Based Anatomy'' (2011).

There are few albums which can claim such a remarkable hold.\" The album rose to No. 4 on Billboard's Heatseekers chart in Feb. 2014 and was No. 1 on CMJ's Loud Rock Chart the following month.\n\n\"Kindly Bent to Free Us [is] an album that, while most definitely in the realm of prog rock, has the kind of open, unpretentious air that makes Rush such an easy-to-love band.\" - [[AllMusic.com|allmusic.com]]\n\n\"The alchemy of front man Paul Masvidal (vocals, guitars & keyboards) combined with rhythmaniac Sean Reinert (drums) and the technically divine Sean Malone (bass), make Cynic one of the finest Prog Rock bands to have ever of landed on Planet Earth\" - [https://burningfist.co.uk burningfist.co.uk]\n\nIn 2015, Masvidal ventured into the performing-arts world with masked duo Onward with Love (OwL), a musical collaboration with acclaimed singer-songwriter [[Amy Correia]]. The pair's singular points of view make for an intriguing synthesis of Eastern-influenced philosophy, symbolist poetry, American blues, jazz and experimental rock. OwL has performed in concert venues, hospices and art galleries around greater Los Angeles. In 2015, Onward with Love unveiled a video for the song 'Kali In My Arms, which was featured in the HBO TV series and film,'[[Looking (TV series)|Looking]]'.

Masvidal has a library songs regularly performed on network and cable television. Music writer Jeff Wagner, in ''[[Mean Deviation (book)|Mean Deviation]]'', stated that \"any viewer of ''3rd Rock from the Sun'', ''That '70s Show'', ''[[The Price Is Right (U.S. game show)|The Price Is Right]]'', ''[[Queer as Folk (2000 TV series)|Queer as Folk]]'', and any number of random television programs has probably stumbled across Cynic's core members without even knowing it.\" In 2015, Masvidal produced a children's album for actor [[Jim Carrey]] titled ''How Roland Rolls''.\n\nIn January 2018, Cynic released a digital single, titled ''Humanoid''. The song marked the first new music from the progressive pioneers since the band's 2014 album Kindly Bent To Free Us. The artwork for \"Humanoid\" features a detail from the painting \"Ayahuasca Dream\" by [[Robert Venosa]], Cynic's longtime collaborator and celebrated artist who passed away in 2011.\n\nIn 2019 and 2020 Masvidal ventured into releasing work as a solo artist under the name 'Masvidal' releasing three conceptual albums title ''Mythical Human Vessel.''

He has released solo records under the moniker 'Masvidal' and previously led the alternative rock band [[\u00c6on Spoke]]. He is also known for having worked with the metal band, [[Death (metal band)|Death]], as a guitarist.\n\n==Early life==\n\nPaul Masvidal was born in San Juan, Puerto Rico to Cuban-American civic and business leader [[Raul Masvidal]]. Masvidal's early days were spent in the Miami area where he studied classical guitar from an early age with Carlos Molina and in college, with guitar teacher, Dave Weissbrot who became a major influence and spurred Masvidal's love of jazz, [[Steinberger|Steinberger guitars]], and Eastern philosophy. He became an initiate to [[Kriya Yoga]] in his late teens and has been a Buddhist practitioner since around 2000,. Masvidal met drummer [[Sean Reinert]] in 1984 at [[Gulliver Schools|Gulliver Academy]] and the duo began making music the day they met, eventually forming the pre-Cynic groups, Crypha and Seaweed.\n\nMasvidal talked in detail about his experiences in his early life in some posts in his Mett\u0101 Mind Journal<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.metalsucks.net/2010/04/07/metta-mind-journal-with-cynics-paul-masvidal-the-bird-outside-my-window/|title=METTA MIND JOURNAL WITH CYNIC'S PAUL MASVIDAL: \"THE BIRD OUTSIDE MY WINDOW\"|date=2010-04-07|website=MetalSucks|language=en|access-date=2020-04-09}}</ref> series, which he published on the music blog [[MetalSucks]].\n\n== Career ==\n\nCynic released four demos from 1988 through 1991, with Masvidal developing a reputation in the Florida music scene for his musicianship. In 1989, when Masvidal was in high school, he toured Mexico as a replacement guitarist for the band [[Death (metal band)|Death]] but declined an invitation to permanently join the band in order to remain committed to Cynic. This had many journalists curious at the time, since Death were emerging as an influential and popular underground act, but Masvidal stuck to his guns and claimed to firmly believe in Cynic. However, Masvidal returned to the Death fold replacing guitarist [[James Murphy (metal guitarist)|James Murphy]] for tour dates on the international ''[[Spiritual Healing (album)|Spiritual Healing]]'' tour in 1990, leading in 1991 to Masvidal and fellow Cynic member Reinert being recruited by Death to record the \"groundbreaking\" ''[[Human (Death album)|Human]]''.\u00a0 Masvidal did extensive world tours, in addition to appearing in the [[music video]] for [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7j8vUbMmOwM ''Lack of Comprehension''].\n\nIn addition, in 1991 Masvidal helped Chicago band [[Master (American band)|Master]] to record their album ''[[On the Seventh Day God Created... Master]]''. Masvidal handled all guitar duties on this album. After finishing their world tour with Death, both Masvidal and Reinert returned to Cynic in 1992.\n\n1993 saw the release of [[Focus (Cynic album)|''Focus'']] on the [[Roadrunner Records|Roadrunner]] label, the only album Cynic recorded until 2008. Roadrunner released a reissue of ''Focus'' in 2004 as a special collector's edition due to high demand. Masvidal also recorded the Cynic spin-off Portal, but by 2007 Cynic returned to touring, featuring Masvidal and Reinert.\n\nCynic took a hiatus in 1995 after record ''The Portal Tapes'' demos and Masvidal moved to Los Angeles in the fall of 1996, upon being offered a full scholarship at [[Musicians Institute]]. During Cynic's hiatus, Masvidal founded \u00c6on Spoke, whose ethereal indie rock was heralded as \"beautiful, exquisite [and] destined for greatness\" by Janice Long, BBC Radio. In 2004, the band received airplay on BBC Radio 2 and XFM for the single ''Silence''. The following year, the track \"Emmanuel\" appeared in the indie breakout film, ''[[What the Bleep Do We Know!?]]'' \u00c6on Spoke songs have also appeared on the Warner Bros. television series ''[[Smallville]]'', ''[[One Tree Hill (TV series)|One Tree Hill]]'' and the motion picture ''[[Cry Wolf (2005 film)|Cry Wolf]]''. \u00a0Their self-titled debut LP was released in 2007 on SPV Records.\n\nCynic reunited in 2008 after a 13-year break to record ''Traced In Air'', their comeback opus. In his review<ref>{{Cite news|last=Times|first=The New York|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/12/01/arts/music/01choi.html|title=New CDs|date=2008-11-30|work=The New York Times|access-date=2020-04-09|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}</ref>, ''New York Times'' music critic Ben Ratliff wrote that Cynic \"should be understood not so much alongside any metal bands but along with the radical harmonic progressives in the last 45 years of pop and jazz: composers like Milton Nascimento, the Beach Boys or Pat Metheny.\"\n\nSince Traced In Air, Cynic has released two conceptual records: ''Re-Traced'' (2010), featuring re-interpretations of several ''Traced in Air'' tracks, and ''Carbon-Based Anatomy'' (2011). Rolling Stone music critic Hank Shteamer raved in his review<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16034-carbon-based-anatomy-ep/|title=Cynic: Carbon-Based Anatomy EP|website=Pitchfork|language=en|access-date=2020-04-09}}</ref> of ''Carbon-Based Anatomy'': \"The title track is a perfectly paced stunner...Cynic sounds fully liberated, not just from their metal past but from any aesthetic concern other than assembling a great song.\" \n\nIn 2013, Paul joined forces with other original members of the Death 'Human' line up and toured worldwide in honor of Chuck Schuldiner's legacy with the group DTA (Death to All). \n\nCynic's third full-length album, ''Kindly Bent to Free Us'', released in 2014, was hailed by [[Malcolm Dome|Malcome Dome]] of Prog Magazine U.K. \u00a0as \"an album that transcends all the limitations of genre and era... There are few albums which can claim such a remarkable hold.\" The album rose to No. 4 on Billboard's Heatseekers chart in Feb. 2014 and was No. 1 on CMJ's Loud Rock Chart the following month.\n\n\"Kindly Bent to Free Us [is] an album that, while most definitely in the realm of prog rock, has the kind of open, unpretentious air that makes Rush such an easy-to-love band.\" - [[AllMusic.com|allmusic.com]]\n\n\"The alchemy of front man Paul Masvidal (vocals, guitars & keyboards) combined with rhythmaniac Sean Reinert (drums) and the technically divine Sean Malone (bass), make Cynic one of the finest Prog Rock bands to have ever of landed on Planet Earth\" - [https://burningfist.co.uk burningfist.co.uk]\n\nIn 2015, Masvidal ventured into the performing-arts world with masked duo Onward with Love (OwL), a musical collaboration with acclaimed singer-songwriter [[Amy Correia]]. The pair's singular points of view make for an intriguing synthesis of Eastern-influenced philosophy, symbolist poetry, American blues, jazz and experimental rock. OwL has performed in concert venues, hospices and art galleries around greater Los Angeles. In 2015, Onward with Love unveiled a video for the song 'Kali In My Arms, which was featured in the HBO TV series and film,'[[Looking (TV series)|Looking]]'. The duo officially released the song [https://distrokid.com/hyperfollow/onwardwithlove/kali-in-my-arms digitally] in 2019 have plans to release a full length record by 2021.\n\nIn 2016, Masvidal along with collaborator, [[Amy Correia]] composed the musical score for the award winning feature film [[The Tiger Hunter]], featuring lead actor, [[Danny Pudi]] \n\nMasvidal also writes and performs music for television and motion pictures, credits include main title (composer credit) on an Emmy nominated NBC teen series show ''[[Operation Junkyard]]'', short films ''The Yellow Umbrella'', ''A Bride in Black'', assistant to [[Ben Vaughn]] and session musician for Carsey Warner network sitcoms ''[[That '70s Show]]'' and ''[[3rd Rock from the Sun]]''. Masvidal has a library songs regularly performed on network and cable television. Music writer Jeff Wagner, in ''[[Mean Deviation (book)|Mean Deviation]]'', stated that \"any viewer of ''3rd Rock from the Sun'', ''That '70s Show'', ''[[The Price Is Right (U.S. game show)|The Price Is Right]]'', ''[[Queer as Folk (2000 TV series)|Queer as Folk]]'', and any number of random television programs has probably stumbled across Cynic's core members without even knowing it.\" In 2015, Masvidal produced a children's album for actor [[Jim Carrey]] titled ''How Roland Rolls''.\n\nIn January 2018, Cynic released a digital single, titled ''Humanoid''. The song marked the first new music from the progressive pioneers since the band's 2014 album Kindly Bent To Free Us. The artwork for \"Humanoid\" features a detail from the painting \"Ayahuasca Dream\" by [[Robert Venosa]], Cynic's longtime collaborator and celebrated artist who passed away in 2011.\n\nIn 2019 and 2020 Masvidal ventured into releasing work as a solo artist under the name 'Masvidal' releasing three conceptual albums title ''Mythical Human Vessel.'' Produced by three-time [[Grammy Award|GRAMMY]] winner Warren Riker (Lauryn Hill, Fugees, Santana). Drawing on influences from musicians [[John Lennon]], [[Brian Eno]], [[Chet Baker]], Russill Paul and [https://www.broadwayworld.com/bwwmusic/artist/Elliott Elliott Smith] to visual artists, [[Mark Rothko]], [[Ai Weiwei]], [[Hilma af Klint|Hilma af Klimt]], the songs embrace concise forms and catchy melodies in spite of their often painful subject matters of loss, depression, and heartache.

With the exception of some pastoralists on the plains and some keeping a limited number of [[cattle]] and [[goat]]s, the Wahehe were primarily an [[agricultural]] people.  In the beginning they seemed to have lived in relative peace, although the various chiefs did quarrel with one another, raided each other for cattle and broke alliances. The population was probably small, with no chiefdom over 5,000 people.  By the middle of the 19th century, however, [[Nguruhe]], one of the more important chiefdoms led by the [[Muyinga]] dynasty, began to push its weight around and expand its influence and power.\n\nIt was [[Munyigumbe]], of the Muyinga family, who began to create the beginnings of a 'state' by both [[marriage]] and [[conquest (military)|conquest]].  A good deal of this was at the expense of the [[Wasangu]], using the Sangu's own military tactics and even utilizing forms of the [[Sangu language (Tanzania)|Sangu]] language to properly rouse Hehe warriors to battle.  Munyigumba even forced the Wasangu, under [[Merere II]], to move their capital to [[Usafwa]].\n\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 105-DOA0039, Deutsch-Ostafrika, Iringa Wahehe.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Hehe warriors from Iringa (1906)]]With Munyigumbs's death in 1878 or 1879, a [[civil war]] broke out and a [[Nymawezi]] [[slave]], married to Munyigumba's sister, was able to kill Munyigumba's brother, leaving the unhappy prospect of dealing with Munyigumba's son [[Mkwawa]].  Mkwawa killed the Nyamwezi slave, Mwumbambe, at a location called the \"place where heads are piled up\", and Mkwawa took center stage, a stage that he continued to dominate until the end of the 19th century.  [[John Iliffe (historian)|John Iliffe]] describes Mkwawa in his book, ''A Modern History of Tanganyika'' as \"slender, sharply intelligent, brutal, and cruel with a praise-name of the ''madness of the year''\".\n\nIt was Mkwawa who, by 1880 or 1881,<ref name = \"Redmayne 1970 101\">{{Harvnb|Redmayne|1970|p=101}}.</ref> became the sole ruler of Uhehe through war and intimidation.{{citation needed|date=April 2013}} Mkwawa continued expanding Hehe power northwards toward the central caravan routes and afflicting the [[Wagogo]], the [[Wakaguru]], the [[Germans]], etc., and in the south and east, anyone in their way, not least of all their old enemies the Wasangu, who then began turning to the Germans for support. By 1890, the Hehe were the strongest most dominant power in the southeast and began conflicting with that other raiding power, the Germans.\n\n'The Hehe' had no elaborate organization but did have the flexibility to make difficulties for their enemies.\n\nSub Chief Motomkali Mukini \u2033Mkini\u2033 was assigned to rule and during his reign had established a military base used to recruit and train at the place so called ''Ihumitangu'', meaning ''the place where colonial fighters were trained''. He was succeeded by his son Galakwila Motomkali Mkini.\n\n== Society ==\nThe Wahehe reside primarily in Uhehe, an area that:\n\n{{Quote|\nlies between the [[Great Ruaha River|Great Ruaha]] and [[Kilombero River|Kilombero]] rivers, in the [[Udzungwa Mountains|Usungwa mountains]] and the plateaux which lie in the northern part of the area known as the [[Southern Highlands, Tanzania|Southern Highlands]]. It includes areas of rainforest, high rolling grasslands, a central plateau of ''[[Brachystegia]]'' woodland and, below the escarpment in the north-east, north and west beside the Great Ruaha River and its tributaries, dry plains covered with thorn scrub.<ref name=\"Redmayne 1968 409\"/>\n}}\n\nWith their armed opposition to German East Africa in mind, colonial descriptions would romanticise the Hehe as \"these coarse, reserved [[mountain people]] [\u2026] a true warrior tribe who live only for war.\"<ref name = \"Redmayne 1968 409\"/> <!--The main reason for existence was war and was the primary occupation of every male.  -->Their power depended on the [[spear]] and on the disciplined force of their armed citizens.  Even after [[firearms]] became more important the spear remained their chief weapon, for on the open plains the use of spears still had the advantage.  The defense of a [[boma (enclosure)|boma]] behind palisades or walls with [[rifle]]s was not their strong point, tactics and a sudden mass spear attack was.\n\nMilitary organization remained the most important part of Wahehe life and every adult male was a warrior.  The youngest lived in the capital, [[Iringa]], where semi-professional warriors trained them.  By the 1890s the Hehe had an immediate following of 2,000 to 3,000 men, with another 20,000 men of fighting age who could be mobilized from their scattered homesteads that by 1800 were normally surrounded by large [[maize]] fields.  It was only later when their military reputation alone was no longer enough and warfare was actually a threat, did they begin to consolidate their villages and begin to build their homes closer together.  Only after the wars ended did they once again build further apart with each homestead ideally surrounded by their own fields, larger houses for their many wives were built and could be surrounded by an open courtyard.\n\nWhile Iliffe considers the Wahehe state to have been unsophisticated, {{Nowrap|Lt. Nigmann}} considered the legal system, traditions, and customs to have been quite sophisticated.  It is true, however, that all authority came from the chief's will and that conquered chiefdoms were not assimilated but were held by for force, brutality, and fear.  Whether one considers the state to be unsophisticated or not, the state was at the same time successful and durable.  A visitor it was repeatedly said, could sense an arrogant confidence that was not found elsewhere, and Hehe identity has survived all colonial pressures.\n\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 105-DOA0734, Deutsch-Ostafrika, Tabora, eine Tembe.jpg|thumb|right|250px|A ''tembe'' (traditional Wahehe housing) from Tabora (1906)]]\n\nWomen captured in war were given to important men, (some men having as many as ten to twenty) who then did almost all of the [[subsistence economy|subsistence]] agriculture, carried water, and all building material, their housing being well insulated against the violent extremes of heat and cold.  A child received his family name, (the praise name) and the types of [[forbidden food]] from the father.  A Wahehe could not marry anyone with the same praise name and the same forbidden food, even if the relationship could not be traced, and could not marry anyone related through the female line.  There was, however, a preference for marrying [[cross cousin]]s. Most communities contained many households who were related to one another.  Two cows and a bull were considered important parts of bride-wealth to be given for a wife.\n\nAlthough [[judge]]s (headmen) were subject to [[bribery]] (and at times quite willing to accept it), there was a recognized system of courts and law enforcement.  Punishment remained fairly simple but had at least some variety.  There were penalties of varied types, such as fines or [[penance]], the death sentence, beatings, and the seldom used expulsion from the chiefdom.  (excepting the death penalty, crippling or anything attacking the health of the individual, or any type of failing was unknown to the Wahehe.)  The village headman was authorized for lighter cases, such as theft or other crimes against property, adultery, personal injury, etc., with the more difficult cases being sent further up the line in the direction of the 'sultan', especially those needing a test administrated by poison.  All cases were presented orally and open to all.  (Only trials of high treason against the sultan were held in secret.)  Two male witnesses were thought sufficient for most 'normal' cases while it was thought that three to five were necessary with female witnesses.\n\nThere could be verdicts for betraying or offending the state or its leader, giving false witness, adultery, (one female witness was sufficient, with a fine of one to three head of cattle) [[incest]] (very seldom if ever used, since females were quite often married between 10 and 13 years of age and needed three to five witnesses), [[rape]] (only the victim was needed as a witness), [[murder]], [[manslaughter]], [[Feud|vendetta]], theft, agricultural theft, receiving stolen goods, and swindling were all parts of the judicial concept and had penalties associated with them.\n\nIf a divorce took place, the husband was entitled to take all [[wean]]ed children away from their mother and the mother's family was expected to return the bride-wealth.  In spite of this, wives frequently obtained divorces, usually after they had already made arrangements with another man.\n\nThe state's strength and power lay in its warriors and their spears, which made it not only disciplined and victorious, but also provided unity and identity, allowing everyone to join in its impressive successes.\n\n==Hehe rebellion==\n\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 105-DOA3124, Deutsch-Ostafrika, Askaris.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Askari soldiers under German command (1906)]]\n[[File:Emil.von.Zelewski.jpg|thumb|200px|Emil von Zelewski]]\n\nThe Wahehe were expanding towards the north and east at the same time the Germans were building stations along the central [[caravan route]] between the coast and [[Tabora]].  Those groups recognizing and accepting German supremacy (showing the German flag) were then brutally attacked, looted, and otherwise destroyed.  After futile German attempts to negotiate with them, an expedition was sent out under the leadership of Commander [[Emil von Zelewski|Zelewski]].\n\nSince [[von Soden]] saw why harm, Zelewski was given the go ahead to attack the Wahehe.  As Iliffe relates in ''A Modern History of Tanganyika'' and [[Holger Doebold]] in ''Emil Zelewski'', with Lt. Tettenborn's official report; (The German Schutztruppe, needing to secure the inland area with its main trade and communications, Zelewski, its new commander, broke camp at 6:30, August 17, 1891, riding a donkey at the head of the column.  \"We burned 25 large village houses and killed 3 tribal warriors.  A large group of Wahehe warriors were sighted with only spears and shields but few rifles.  Shots from our side were enough to frighten them away.\"  As its center reached the waiting Hehe, an officer shot at a bird.  The Hehe grasped their spears and charged.  The [[Askari]] fired only one or two rounds before they were overwhelmed.  \"The confusion increased when the pack donkeys of the artillery train panicked and stampeded into the 5th company.  Soon the Askari also panicked.  Lt. [[von Heydebreck]] managed to reach a nearby tembe with black officers Morgan Effendi and Gaber Effendi and twenty Askari.\"  A sixteen-year-old had speared Zelewski on his donkey.  In ten minutes most of the column was dead.  \"I also decided to retreat through the chaos of fleeing porters, pillaging Wahehe, dying warriors, and retreating wounded Askaris.\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 105-DOA0043, Deutsch-Ostafrika, Einheimische Bev\u00f6lkerung.jpg|thumb|250px|Warriors from Kondoa (1906)]]\nThe rearguard escaped, occupied a hill, raised its flag, and sounded [[bugle calls]] to rally survivors.  I sent a patrol to guide Lt. Heydebreck wounded twice by a spear behind his right ear and covered with blood, to our position.  NCO Thiemann succumbed to his wounds on the night of 17 to 18 August and we buried him at our tembe position outside the sight of the Wahehe warriors.\"  The Hehe set fire to the grass, burning some of the wounded and hoping to encircle the rearguard.  Some 300-400 Hehe followed but did not attack, having already lost 60 dead.  Another 200 later died of wounds.  The Germans then retreated in the direction of [[Kondoa district|Kondoa]].  \"Still with us are Lt. von Heydebreck, almost recovered from his wounds, Sergeant Kay, NCO Wutzer, Morgan Effendi, Gaber Effendi, 62 Askari (11 of them wounded), 74 porters (seven wounded), four donkeys, and the main part of our baggage.\")\n\nLt. Tettenborn believed that if it had not been for the death of a large number of Wahehe chiefs, Mkwawa incorrectly included, no one would have survived.  Saving the main 'part of the baggage' is also incorrect, as it was not saved.  Zelewski had started with 13 Europeans, some 320 Askaris, 170 porters, [[machine gun]]s, and [[field artillery]].  Of these, ten Europeans, 256 Askaris, and 96 porters had been lost.  The German defeat made a truly enormous impression and the Hehe had now gained reputation as the most powerful soldiers in German East Africa and the [[Schutztruppe]] was no longer in a position to continue attacking the Wahehe.{{Citation needed|date=November 2011}}\n\n[[Julius von Soden]], the governor now in charge of German East Africa, vetoed revenge.  'We should have digested the coast before we devoured the interior'.  For eighteen months all expeditions were banned, even though the German military was unhappy.  Particularly [[von Prince]] could not bring himself to leave the Hehe alone and used his forts in the north to invade south into Hehe territory.\n\nSoden left in 1893, his concept ruined.  With Colonel [[Friedrich von Schele|Freiherr von Schele]], the new governor who brought a policy of aggression, there began the expedition of von Prince, Wynecken, and Zugf\u00fchrer Bauer in support of Merere. Negotiations had failed and caravans continued to be raided until the Germans attacked and took possession of Mkwawa's capital, Iringa, in 1894.  (This time, however, the Germans were prepared with 609 Askari and three machine-guns.)  Mkwawa, though, was still not captured, and the Hehe continued to attack their neighbors and kill Germans.  There was still no peace.  Only with Mkwawa's suicide did 'peace' finally come to Uhehe.\n\nWhile von Schele, given credit for Mkwawa's final defeat and presented with Germany's highest decoration, was then continually attacked by the political moderates, and finally placed under civilian control from Berlin.  Schele then resigned and was followed by more peaceful administrators for the next two years, who nevertheless continued to pressure the Wahehe.\n\n(Tom von Prince, after Mkwawa's defeat, indicated great offence with the Wahehe refusal to point out the youth responsible for Zelewski's death.  Prince claimed that the German military would never have punished a warrior for following his orders.)\n\nBy 1896, the Hehe were divided, with some of them beginning to submit to the Germans, and Mkwawa found himself isolated as an outlaw, but always protected by the general Wahehe population.  He raided, ambushed patrols, and attacked German outposts, aided by 'loyal Wahehe' and even Sangu warriors of Merere III (son of Merere II).  The Germans increased their campaign, searched again and again, even subjecting those who aided Mkwawa to the death penalty.  They tried setting up one of Mkwawa's brothers as chief, but had him executed after two months, holding him responsible for the continuing attacks on German patrols.\n\nIt was only in July 1898, after being trapped, that Mkwawa shot himself.  The Germans removed Mkwawa's head and sent it to Germany.  Mkwawa and the Hehe had become so well known that a clause was inserted in the Treaty of Versailles ordering the skull be returned to Uhehe.  It was found, not in Berlin, but in Bremen, and was finally returned, not to Iringa, but to nearby Kalenga, and then not until 1956. The identity of the skull is questionable.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://einestages.spiegel.de/external/ShowTopicAlbumBackground/a4453/l6/l0/F.html#featuredEntry |title=Der Sch\u00e4del des Sultans - einestages |publisher=Einestages.spiegel.de |date= |accessdate=2010-05-28}}</ref> Mkwawa still today have the status of a national hero in Tanzania, even after over one hundred years.\n\nThe Wahehe never again revolted, not during or after [[Maji Maji]], but bureaucrats from Tanzania are still very wary of them.

With the exception of some pastoralists on the plains and some keeping a limited number of [[cattle]] and [[goat]]s, the Wahehe were primarily an [[agricultural]] people.  In the beginning they seemed to have lived in relative peace, although the various chiefs did quarrel with one another, raided each other for cattle and broke alliances. The population was probably small, with no chiefdom over 5,000 people.  By the middle of the 19th century, however, [[Nguruhe]], one of the more important chiefdoms led by the [[Muyinga]] dynasty, began to push its weight around and expand its influence and power.\n\nIt was [[Munyigumbe]], of the Muyinga family, who began to create the beginnings of a 'state' by both [[marriage]] and [[conquest (military)|conquest]].  A good deal of this was at the expense of the [[Wasangu]], using the Sangu's own military tactics and even utilizing forms of the [[Sangu language (Tanzania)|Sangu]] language to properly rouse Hehe warriors to battle.  Munyigumba even forced the Wasangu, under [[Merere II]], to move their capital to [[Usafwa]].\n\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 105-DOA0039, Deutsch-Ostafrika, Iringa Wahehe.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Hehe warriors from Iringa (1906)]]With Munyigumbs's death in 1878 or 1879, a [[civil war]] broke out and a [[Nymawezi]] [[slave]], married to Munyigumba's sister, was able to kill Munyigumba's brother, leaving the unhappy prospect of dealing with Munyigumba's son [[Mkwawa]].  Mkwawa killed the Nyamwezi slave, Mwumbambe, at a location called the \"place where heads are piled up\", and Mkwawa took center stage, a stage that he continued to dominate until the end of the 19th century.  [[John Iliffe (historian)|John Iliffe]] describes Mkwawa in his book, ''A Modern History of Tanganyika'' as \"slender, sharply intelligent, brutal, and cruel with a praise-name of the ''madness of the year''\".\n\nIt was Mkwawa who, by 1880 or 1881,<ref name = \"Redmayne 1970 101\">{{Harvnb|Redmayne|1970|p=101}}.</ref> became the sole ruler of Uhehe through war and intimidation.{{citation needed|date=April 2013}} Mkwawa continued expanding Hehe power northwards toward the central caravan routes and afflicting the [[Wagogo]], the [[Wakaguru]], the [[Germans]], etc., and in the south and east, anyone in their way, not least of all their old enemies the Wasangu, who then began turning to the Germans for support. By 1890, the Hehe were the strongest most dominant power in the southeast and began conflicting with that other raiding power, the Germans.\n\n'The Hehe' had no elaborate organization but did have the flexibility to make difficulties for their enemies.\n\nSub Chief Motomkali Mukini \u2033Mkini\u2033 was assigned to rule and during his reign had established a military base used to recruit and train at the place so called ''Ihumitangu'', meaning ''the place where colonial fighters were trained''. He was succeeded by his son Galakwila Motomkali Mkini.\n\n== Society ==\nThe Wahehe reside primarily in Uhehe, an area that:\n\n{{Quote|\nlies between the [[Great Ruaha River|Great Ruaha]] and [[Kilombero River|Kilombero]] rivers, in the [[Udzungwa Mountains|Usungwa mountains]] and the plateaux which lie in the northern part of the area known as the [[Southern Highlands, Tanzania|Southern Highlands]]. It includes areas of rainforest, high rolling grasslands, a central plateau of ''[[Brachystegia]]'' woodland and, below the escarpment in the north-east, north and west beside the Great Ruaha River and its tributaries, dry plains covered with thorn scrub.<ref name=\"Redmayne 1968 409\"/>\n}}\n\nWith their armed opposition to German East Africa in mind, colonial descriptions would romanticise the Hehe as \"these coarse, reserved [[mountain people]] [\u2026] a true warrior tribe who live only for war.\"<ref name = \"Redmayne 1968 409\"/> <!--The main reason for existence was war and was the primary occupation of every male.  -->Their power depended on the [[spear]] and on the disciplined force of their armed citizens.  Even after [[firearms]] became more important the spear remained their chief weapon, for on the open plains the use of spears still had the advantage.  The defense of a [[boma (enclosure)|boma]] behind palisades or walls with [[rifle]]s was not their strong point, tactics and a sudden mass spear attack was.\n\nMilitary organization remained the most important part of Wahehe life and every adult male was a warrior.  The youngest lived in the capital, [[Iringa]], where semi-professional warriors trained them.  By the 1890s the Hehe had an immediate following of 2,000 to 3,000 men, with another 20,000 men of fighting age who could be mobilized from their scattered homesteads that by 1800 were normally surrounded by large [[maize]] fields.  It was only later when their military reputation alone was no longer enough and warfare was actually a threat, did they begin to consolidate their villages and begin to build their homes closer together.  Only after the wars ended did they once again build further apart with each homestead ideally surrounded by their own fields, larger houses for their many wives were built and could be surrounded by an open courtyard.\n\nWhile Iliffe considers the Wahehe state to have been unsophisticated, {{Nowrap|Lt. Nigmann}} considered the legal system, traditions, and customs to have been quite sophisticated.  It is true, however, that all authority came from the chief's will and that conquered chiefdoms were not assimilated but were held by for force, brutality, and fear.  Whether one considers the state to be unsophisticated or not, the state was at the same time successful and durable.  A visitor it was repeatedly said, could sense an arrogant confidence that was not found elsewhere, and Hehe identity has survived all colonial pressures.\n\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 105-DOA0734, Deutsch-Ostafrika, Tabora, eine Tembe.jpg|thumb|right|250px|A ''tembe'' (traditional Wahehe housing) from Tabora (1906)]]\n\nWomen captured in war were given to important men, (some men having as many as ten to twenty) who then did almost all of the [[subsistence economy|subsistence]] agriculture, carried water, and all building material, their housing being well insulated against the violent extremes of heat and cold.  A child received his family name, (the praise name) and the types of [[forbidden food]] from the father.  A Wahehe could not marry anyone with the same praise name and the same forbidden food, even if the relationship could not be traced, and could not marry anyone related through the female line.  There was, however, a preference for marrying [[cross cousin]]s. Most communities contained many households who were related to one another.  Two cows and a bull were considered important parts of bride-wealth to be given for a wife.\n\nAlthough [[judge]]s (headmen) were subject to [[bribery]] (and at times quite willing to accept it), there was a recognized system of courts and law enforcement.  Punishment remained fairly simple but had at least some variety.  There were penalties of varied types, such as fines or [[penance]], the death sentence, beatings, and the seldom used expulsion from the chiefdom.  (excepting the death penalty, crippling or anything attacking the health of the individual, or any type of failing was unknown to the Wahehe.)  The village headman was authorized for lighter cases, such as theft or other crimes against property, adultery, personal injury, etc., with the more difficult cases being sent further up the line in the direction of the 'sultan', especially those needing a test administrated by poison.  All cases were presented orally and open to all.  (Only trials of high treason against the sultan were held in secret.)  Two male witnesses were thought sufficient for most 'normal' cases while it was thought that three to five were necessary with female witnesses.\n\nThere could be verdicts for betraying or offending the state or its leader, giving false witness, adultery, (one female witness was sufficient, with a fine of one to three head of cattle) [[incest]] (very seldom if ever used, since females were quite often married between 10 and 13 years of age and needed three to five witnesses), [[rape]] (only the victim was needed as a witness), [[murder]], [[manslaughter]], [[Feud|vendetta]], theft, agricultural theft, receiving stolen goods, and swindling were all parts of the judicial concept and had penalties associated with them.\n\nIf a divorce took place, the husband was entitled to take all [[wean]]ed children away from their mother and the mother's family was expected to return the bride-wealth.  In spite of this, wives frequently obtained divorces, usually after they had already made arrangements with another man.\n\nThe state's strength and power lay in its warriors and their spears, which made it not only disciplined and victorious, but also provided unity and identity, allowing everyone to join in its impressive successes.\n\n==Hehe rebellion==\n\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 105-DOA3124, Deutsch-Ostafrika, Askaris.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Askari soldiers under German command (1906)]]\n[[File:Emil.von.Zelewski.jpg|thumb|200px|Emil von Zelewski]]\n\nThe Wahehe were expanding towards the north and east at the same time the Germans were building stations along the central [[caravan route]] between the coast and [[Tabora]].  Those groups recognizing and accepting German supremacy (showing the German flag) were then brutally attacked, looted, and otherwise destroyed.  After futile German attempts to negotiate with them, an expedition was sent out under the leadership of Commander [[Emil von Zelewski|Zelewski]].\n\nSince [[von Soden]] saw why harm, Zelewski was given the go ahead to attack the Wahehe.  As Iliffe relates in ''A Modern History of Tanganyika'' and [[Holger Doebold]] in ''Emil Zelewski'', with Lt. Tettenborn's official report; (The German Schutztruppe, needing to secure the inland area with its main trade and communications, Zelewski, its new commander, broke camp at 6:30, August 17, 1891, riding a donkey at the head of the column.  \"We burned 25 large village houses and killed 3 tribal warriors.  A large group of Wahehe warriors were sighted with only spears and shields but few rifles.  Shots from our side were enough to frighten them away.\"  As its center reached the waiting Hehe, an officer shot at a bird.  The Hehe grasped their spears and charged.  The [[Askari]] fired only one or two rounds before they were overwhelmed.  \"The confusion increased when the pack donkeys of the artillery train panicked and stampeded into the 5th company.  Soon the Askari also panicked.  Lt. [[von Heydebreck]] managed to reach a nearby tembe with black officers Morgan Effendi and Gaber Effendi and twenty Askari.\"  A sixteen-year-old had speared Zelewski on his donkey.  In ten minutes most of the column was dead.  \"I also decided to retreat through the chaos of fleeing porters, pillaging Wahehe, dying warriors, and retreating wounded Askaris.\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 105-DOA0043, Deutsch-Ostafrika, Einheimische Bev\u00f6lkerung.jpg|thumb|250px|Warriors from Kondoa (1906)]]\nThe rearguard escaped, occupied a hill, raised its flag, and sounded [[bugle calls]] to rally survivors.  I sent a patrol to guide Lt. Heydebreck wounded twice by a spear behind his right ear and covered with blood, to our position.  NCO Thiemann succumbed to his wounds on the night of 17 to 18 August and we buried him at our tembe position outside the sight of the Wahehe warriors.\"  The Hehe set fire to the grass, burning some of the wounded and hoping to encircle the rearguard.  Some 300-400 Hehe followed but did not attack, having already lost 60 dead.  Another 200 later died of wounds.  The Germans then retreated in the direction of [[Kondoa district|Kondoa]].  \"Still with us are Lt. von Heydebreck, almost recovered from his wounds, Sergeant Kay, NCO Wutzer, Morgan Effendi, Gaber Effendi, 62 Askari (11 of them wounded), 74 porters (seven wounded), four donkeys, and the main part of our baggage.\")\n\nLt. Tettenborn believed that if it had not been for the death of a large number of Wahehe chiefs, Mkwawa incorrectly included, no one would have survived.  Saving the main 'part of the baggage' is also incorrect, as it was not saved.  Zelewski had started with 13 Europeans, some 320 Askaris, 170 porters, [[machine gun]]s, and [[field artillery]].  Of these, ten Europeans, 256 Askaris, and 96 porters had been lost.  The German defeat made a truly enormous impression and the Hehe had now gained reputation as the most powerful soldiers in German East Africa and the [[Schutztruppe]] was no longer in a position to continue attacking the Wahehe.{{Citation needed|date=November 2011}}\n\n[[Julius von Soden]], the governor now in charge of German East Africa, vetoed revenge.  'We should have digested the coast before we devoured the interior'.  For eighteen months all expeditions were banned, even though the German military was unhappy.  Particularly [[von Prince]] could not bring himself to leave the Hehe alone and used his forts in the north to invade south into Hehe territory.\n\nSoden left in 1893, his concept ruined.  With Colonel [[Friedrich von Schele|Freiherr von Schele]], the new governor who brought a policy of aggression, there began the expedition of von Prince, Wynecken, and Zugf\u00fchrer Bauer in support of Merere. Negotiations had failed and caravans continued to be raided until the Germans attacked and took possession of Mkwawa's capital, Iringa, in 1894.  (This time, however, the Germans were prepared with 609 Askari and three machine-guns.)  Mkwawa, though, was still not captured, and the Hehe continued to attack their neighbors and kill Germans.  There was still no peace.  Only with Mkwawa's suicide did 'peace' finally come to Uhehe.\n\nWhile von Schele, given credit for Mkwawa's final defeat and presented with Germany's highest decoration, was then continually attacked by the political moderates, and finally placed under civilian control from Berlin.  Schele then resigned and was followed by more peaceful administrators for the next two years, who nevertheless continued to pressure the Wahehe.\n\n(Tom von Prince, after Mkwawa's defeat, indicated great offence with the Wahehe refusal to point out the youth responsible for Zelewski's death.  Prince claimed that the German military would never have punished a warrior for following his orders.)\n\nBy 1896, the Hehe were divided, with some of them beginning to submit to the Germans, and Mkwawa found himself isolated as an outlaw, but always protected by the general Wahehe population.  He raided, ambushed patrols, and attacked German outposts, aided by 'loyal Wahehe' and even Sangu warriors of Merere III (son of Merere II).  The Germans increased their campaign, searched again and again, even subjecting those who aided Mkwawa to the death penalty.  They tried setting up one of Mkwawa's brothers as chief, but had him executed after two months, holding him responsible for the continuing attacks on German patrols.\n\nIt was only in July 1898, after being trapped, that Mkwawa shot himself.  The Germans removed Mkwawa's head and sent it to Germany.  Mkwawa and the Hehe had become so well known that a clause was inserted in the Treaty of Versailles ordering the skull be returned to Uhehe.  It was found, not in Berlin, but in Bremen, and was finally returned, not to Iringa, but to nearby Kalenga, and then not until 1956. The identity of the skull is questionable.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://einestages.spiegel.de/external/ShowTopicAlbumBackground/a4453/l6/l0/F.html#featuredEntry |title=Der Sch\u00e4del des Sultans - einestages |publisher=Einestages.spiegel.de |date= |accessdate=2010-05-28}}</ref> Mkwawa still today have the status of a national hero in Tanzania, even after over one hundred years.\n\nThe Wahehe never again revolted, not during or after [[Maji Maji]], but bureaucrats from Tanzania are still very wary of them.
