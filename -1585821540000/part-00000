The primary catalyst of this was Wests Tigers requiring reinforcements at Grant's preferred position of hooker due to the retirement of [[Robbie Farah]] and long term injury to Wests Tigers preferred replacement [[Jacob Liddle]]. Grant, being Melbourne's third choice at his preferred position behind Melbourne Storm captain [[Cameron Smith]] and [[New Zealand national rugby league team| New Zealand Kiwis]] international hooker [[Brandon Smith]] was receptive to the move and began to push for it himself. Initially the NRL salary cap administrators refused to process the request because Melbourne would have gone over the salary cap if the deal had been processed at that time.<ref>https://www.smh.com.au/sport/nrl/nrl-torpedoes-tigers-storm-loan-deal-20200218-p5420w.html</ref> \n\nAfter the NRL initially rejected the arrangement Grant requested an immediate release from his Storm contract in the hopes of joining the Tigers as soon as possible though this did not eventuate.<ref>https://www.smh.com.au/sport/nrl/harry-grant-asks-storm-for-immediate-release-to-join-tigers-20200226-p544j5.html</ref> \n\nThere were further delays due to injury to Brandon Smith causing Melbourne to hold up proceedings so they could have Grant provide back up to Cameron Smith in the early rounds of the season<ref>https://www.nrl.com/news/2020/03/16/tigers-storm-swap-deal-back-on-cards-as-smith-eyes-early-injury-return/</ref>, and briefly by Momirovski wishing to sign a new contract with Wests Tigers prior to leaving <ref>https://www.smh.com.au/sport/nrl/trading-places-nrl-close-to-approving-tigers-storm-player-loan-20200321-p54ci7.html</ref>, but the deal was finally made official during round 2 of the season on March 21st, 2020.
