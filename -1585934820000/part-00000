This unofficial title is the precursor to the [[mountains classification in the Tour de France|mountains classification]].{{sfn|Cleijne|2014|p=156}}\n\n==Aftermath==\nOne week after the race ended, Germany had declared war on France, starting [[World War I]] in France. This made the organization of a big cycling race impossible for the next four years, and the Tour de France would start again in [[1919 Tour de France|1919]]. By that time, Tour de France champions [[Lucien Petit-Breton]], [[Fran\u00e7ois Faber]] and [[Octave Lapize]] had died in the first world war.\nThe winner of the 1914 Tour de France, Philippe Thys, would survive the war, and go on for his third victory in 1920.
