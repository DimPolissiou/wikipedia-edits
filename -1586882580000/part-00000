A [[subalpine]] to [[Alpine tundra|alpine]] species, it is a [[sure-footed]] climber commonly seen on cliffs and ice.\n\nDespite its vernacular name, it is not a member of ''[[Capra (genus)|Capra]]'', the genus that includes all other [[goat]]s, such as the [[wild goat]], ''Capra aegagrus'', from which the domestic goat is derived. The mountain goat was used as the emblem of the Great Northern Railway until merger with Burlington Northern in 1970.\n\n== Classification and evolution ==\nThe mountain goat is an even-toed [[ungulate]] of the order [[Artiodactyla]] and the family [[Bovidae]] that includes [[antelope]]s, [[gazelle]]s, and [[cattle]]. It belongs to the subfamily [[Caprinae]], along with [[Capra (genus)|true goats]], [[Ovis|wild sheep]], the [[chamois]], the [[muskox]] and other species. Notably, the [[takin]]s of the [[Himalaya]]n region, while not a [[sister lineage]] of the mountain goat, are nonetheless very closely related and almost [[coeval]]; they and the mountain goat are a case of [[parallel evolution]] from an ancestral goat. Other members of this group are the ''[[Pseudois]]'' \"blue sheep\", the true goats and the [[Himalayan tahr]]. The sheep lineage is also very closely related, while the muskox lineage is somewhat more distant. The mountain goats probably diverged from their relatives in the late [[Tortonian]], some 7.5 to 8 million years ago.{{cn|date=April 2020}}\n\nGiven that all major caprine lineages emerged in the [[Late Miocene]] and contain at least one but usually several species from the eastern Himalayan region, their most likely place of origin is between today's [[Tibet]] and [[Mongolia]] or nearby. The mountain goat's ancestors thus probably crossed the [[Bering Strait]] after they split from their relatives, presumably before the [[Wisconsinian glaciation]]. Unfortunately, no [[Pliocene]] mountain goats have been identified yet; the known [[fossil record]] is fairly recent, entirely from North America, and barely differs from the living animals. In the [[Pleistocene]], the small prehistoric mountain goat ''[[Oreamnos harringtoni]]'' lived in the southern Rocky Mountains. [[Ancient DNA]] studies suggest that this was the [[sister species]] of the living mountain goat, not its ancestor; consequently, the living species would also date back to the Pleistocene at least.<ref>Campos et al 2010{{full|date=April 2020}}</ref><ref>Bibi 2013{{full|date=April 2020}}</ref>\n\nThe mountain goat is the [[monotypic|only living species]] in the genus ''[[Oreamnos]]''.

Its northernmost range is said to be along the northern fringe of the [[Chugach Mountains]] in southcentral Alaska. Introduced populations can also be found in such areas as [[Idaho]], [[Wyoming]], [[Utah]], [[Nevada]], [[Oregon]], [[Colorado]], [[South Dakota]], and the [[Olympic Peninsula]] of Washington.\n\nMountain goats are the largest mammals found in their high-altitude [[habitat]]s, which can exceed elevations of 13,000 feet (4,000&nbsp;m). They sometimes descend to sea level in coastal areas although they are primarily an [[alpine climate|alpine]] and [[subalpine]] species. The animals usually stay above the [[tree line]] throughout the year but they will migrate seasonally to higher or lower elevations within that range. Winter migrations to low-elevation [[Salt lick|mineral licks]] often take them several kilometers through forested areas.<ref>{{cite web|title=Mountain Goats|url=http://www.nps.gov/noca/naturescience/mountain-goats.htm|work=North Cascades National Park Service Complex|publisher=National Park Service|accessdate=21 October 2010}}</ref>\n\n== Movement patterns ==\n[[File:Oreamnos americanus 21073.JPG|thumb|In the [[Cascade Range]], [[Mount Rainier National Park]], near the southwestern limit of their distribution.]]\nDaily movements by individual mountain goats are primarily confined to areas on the same mountain face, drainage basin, or alpine opening. Daily movements reflect an individual's needs for foraging, resting, [[thermoregulation]] and security from predators or disturbance. Seasonal movements primarily reflect nutritional needs (e.g., movements to and from mineral licks/[[salt lick]]), reproductive needs (i.e., movement of pre-parturient females to \"kidding\" areas; movement to rutting areas), and climatic influences (i.e., movement to areas in response to foraging conditions). In general, seasonal movements are likely to exhibit a strong elevational component, whereby lower, forested elevations are used during the spring-summer (security cover effects) to access lower elevation mineral licks, and during winter (thermal cover effects) to access forage. The farthest movements are expected to be by dispersing mountain goats. Such movements are likely to involve mountain goats crossing forested valleys as they move between mountain blocks.\n\n== Diet ==\n[[File:Mountain goat - artificial salt lick.jpg|thumb|upright|Young mountain goat licking handrail for salt]]\nMountain goats are herbivores and spend most of their time grazing. Their diets include [[grass]]es, [[herb]]s, [[Cyperaceae|sedges]], [[fern]]s, [[moss]]es, [[lichen]]s, and twigs and leaves from the low-growing shrubs and [[conifer]]s of their high-altitude habitat.\n\n[[File:Mountain goat at Mount Rushmore National Memorial.jpg|thumbnail|A mountain goat grazing at [[Mount Rushmore]], [[South Dakota]]]]\nIn captivity, the mountain goat's diet can also include grain, [[alfalfa]], fruits, vegetables and [[grass]].\n\n== Lifecycle and mating ==\n{{refimprove section|date=December 2013}}\nIn the wild, mountain goats usually live 12 to 15 years, with their lifespans limited by the wearing down of their teeth. In zoos, however, they can live for 16 to 20 years.\n\n[[File:Mountain goat kid.jpg|thumb|Mountain goat kid at Cawridge, Alberta]]\nMountain goats reach sexual maturity at about 30 months.<ref>D. Chadwick (1983). ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=SMnXTHE5iWMC&printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&q&f=false A Beast the Color of Winter \u2013 The Mountain Goat Observed]''. [[Sierra Club Books]]. San Francisco. 208 p.</ref> Nannies in a herd undergo synchronized [[estrus]] in late October through early December, at which time males and females participate in a mating ritual. Mature billies stare at nannies for long periods, dig rutting pits, and fight each other in showy (though occasionally dangerous) scuffles. Young billies sometimes try to participate, but they are ignored by nannies; nannies also sometimes pursue inattentive billies. Both males and females usually mate with multiple individuals during breeding season, although some billies try to keep other males away from certain nannies. After the breeding season is over, males and females move away from each other, with the adult billies breaking up into small bands of two or three individuals. Nannies form loose-knit nursery groups of up to 50 animals.\n\n[[File:Wherever you go I will go.JPG|thumb|right|Mountain goat with kid in [[Glacier National Park (U.S.)|Glacier National Park]]]]\nKids are born in the spring (late May or early June) after a six-month gestation period. Nannies give birth, usually to a single offspring, after moving to an isolated ledge;'' post partum'', they lick the kid dry and ingest the [[placenta]]. Kids weigh a little over {{Convert|3|kg}} at birth and begin to run and climb (or attempt to do so) within hours. Although they are mostly weaned within one month, kids follow their mothers closely for the first year of life (or until the nanny gives birth again, if this does not occur the next breeding season); nannies protect their young by leading them out of danger, standing over them when faced by predators, and positioning themselves below their kids on steep slopes to stop freefalls.\n\n== Aggressive behavior ==\nNannies can be very competitive and protective of their space and food sources.  They fight with one another for dominance in conflicts that can ultimately include all the nannies in the herd.  In these battles, nannies circle each other with their heads lowered, displaying their horns.  As with fights between billies during breeding season, these conflicts can occasionally lead to injury or death, but are usually harmless.  To avoid fighting, an animal may show a posture of nonaggression by stretching low to the ground.\n\nIn regions below the tree line, nannies use their fighting abilities to protect themselves and their offspring from predators. Predators, including [[Gray wolf|wolves]], [[wolverine]]s, [[Canadian lynx|lynx]]es, and [[bear]]s, attack goats of most ages given the opportunity. The [[cougar|mountain lion]] is perhaps the primary predator, being powerful enough to overwhelm the largest adults and uniquely nimble enough to navigate the rocky ecosystem of the goats. Though their size protects them from most potential predators in higher altitudes, nannies must sometimes defend their young from both [[bald eagle|bald]] and [[golden eagle]]s,<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Hamel|first1=Sandra|last2=C\u00f4t\u00e9|first2=Steeve D.|title=Maternal defensive behavior of mountain goats against predation by Golden Eagles|journal=Western North American Naturalist|date=2009|volume=69|issue=1|pages=115\u2013118|url=http://scholarsarchive.byu.edu/wnan/vol69/iss1/13|language=en|issn=1527-0904|doi=10.3398/064.069.0103}}</ref> which can be a predatory threat to kids.<ref name= ADW /> Nannies have even been observed trying to dominate the more passive, but often heavier [[bighorn sheep]] that share some of their territory.\n\nMountain goats can occasionally be aggressive towards humans, with at least one reported fatality resulting from an attack by a mountain goat.<ref>[http://www.seattlepi.com/local/428578_hiker17.html Hiker killed by mountain goat in Olympic Nat'l.

The mountain goat's ancestors thus probably crossed the [[Bering Strait]] after they split from their relatives, presumably before the [[Wisconsinian glaciation]]. Unfortunately, no [[Pliocene]] mountain goats have been identified yet; the known [[fossil record]] is fairly recent, entirely from North America, and barely differs from the living animals. In the [[Pleistocene]], the small prehistoric mountain goat ''[[Oreamnos harringtoni]]'' lived in the southern Rocky Mountains. [[Ancient DNA]] studies suggest that this was the [[sister species]] of the living mountain goat, not its ancestor; consequently, the living species would also date back to the Pleistocene at least.<ref>Campos et al 2010{{full|date=April 2020}}</ref><ref>Bibi 2013{{full|date=April 2020}}</ref>\n\nThe mountain goat is the [[monotypic|only living species]] in the genus ''[[Oreamnos]]''. The name ''Oreamnos'' is derived from the Greek term ''oros'' (stem ''ore-'') \"mountain\" (or, alternatively, ''oreas'' \"mountain nymph\") and the word ''amnos'' \"lamb\".\n\n== General appearance and characteristics ==\n[[File:Mountain Goat Mount Massive.JPG|thumb|right|Mountain goat on [[Mount Massive]], [[Colorado]], United States]]\nBoth billy (male) and nanny (female)<ref>{{cite web|title=Goat Hunting in Alaska|url=http://www.adfg.alaska.gov/index.cfm?adfg=goathunting.billyid|website=alaska.gov|publisher=Alaska Department of Fish and Game|accessdate=13 December 2015}}</ref> mountain goats have beards, short tails, and long black horns, {{convert|15|\u2013|28|cm|in|abbr=on}} in length, which contain yearly growth rings. They are protected from the elements by their woolly white double coats. The fine, dense wool of their undercoats is covered by an outer layer of longer, hollow hairs. Mountain goats molt in spring by rubbing against rocks and trees, with the adult billies shedding their extra wool first and the pregnant nannies shedding last. Their coats help them to withstand winter temperatures as low as {{Convert|-50|F}} and winds of up to {{Convert|160|km/h}}.\n\n[[File:Flickr - Oregon Department of Fish & Wildlife - 023 mtn goat indian rock paustian odfw.jpg|thumbnail|upright|Close-up of head]]\nA billy stands about {{convert|1|m|ft|abbr=on}} at the shoulder to the waist and can weigh considerably more than the nanny (around 30% more in some cases).

The tips of their feet have sharp [[dewclaw]]s that keep them from slipping. They have powerful shoulder and neck muscles that help propel them up steep slopes.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Lewinson|first=Ryan T.|last2=Stefanyshyn|first2=Darren J.|title=A descriptive analysis of the climbing mechanics of a mountain goat ( Oreamnos americanus )|journal=Zoology|volume=119|issue=6|pages=541\u2013546|doi=10.1016/j.zool.2016.06.001|pmid=27402383|year=2016}}</ref>\n\n== Range and habitat ==\nThe mountain goat inhabits the [[Rocky Mountains]] and [[Cascade Range]] and other mountain regions of the [[Western Cordillera (North America)|Western Cordillera]] of North America, from [[Washington (state)|Washington]], [[Idaho]] and [[Montana]] through [[British Columbia]] and [[Alberta]], into the southern [[Yukon]] and southeastern [[Alaska]]. Its northernmost range is said to be along the northern fringe of the [[Chugach Mountains]] in southcentral Alaska. Introduced populations can also be found in such areas as [[Idaho]], [[Wyoming]], [[Utah]], [[Nevada]], [[Oregon]], [[Colorado]], [[South Dakota]], and the [[Olympic Peninsula]] of Washington.\n\nMountain goats are the largest mammals found in their high-altitude [[habitat]]s, which can exceed elevations of 13,000 feet (4,000&nbsp;m). They sometimes descend to sea level in coastal areas although they are primarily an [[alpine climate|alpine]] and [[subalpine]] species. The animals usually stay above the [[tree line]] throughout the year but they will migrate seasonally to higher or lower elevations within that range. Winter migrations to low-elevation [[Salt lick|mineral licks]] often take them several kilometers through forested areas.<ref>{{cite web|title=Mountain Goats|url=http://www.nps.gov/noca/naturescience/mountain-goats.htm|work=North Cascades National Park Service Complex|publisher=National Park Service|accessdate=21 October 2010}}</ref>\n\n== Movement patterns ==\n[[File:Oreamnos americanus 21073.JPG|thumb|In the [[Cascade Range]], [[Mount Rainier National Park]], near the southwestern limit of their distribution.]]\nDaily movements by individual mountain goats are primarily confined to areas on the same mountain face, drainage basin, or alpine opening. Daily movements reflect an individual's needs for foraging, resting, [[thermoregulation]] and security from predators or disturbance. Seasonal movements primarily reflect nutritional needs (e.g., movements to and from mineral licks/[[salt lick]]), reproductive needs (i.e., movement of pre-parturient females to \"kidding\" areas; movement to rutting areas), and climatic influences (i.e., movement to areas in response to foraging conditions). In general, seasonal movements are likely to exhibit a strong elevational component, whereby lower, forested elevations are used during the spring-summer (security cover effects) to access lower elevation mineral licks, and during winter (thermal cover effects) to access forage. The farthest movements are expected to be by dispersing mountain goats. Such movements are likely to involve mountain goats crossing forested valleys as they move between mountain blocks.\n\n== Diet ==\n[[File:Mountain goat - artificial salt lick.jpg|thumb|upright|Young mountain goat licking handrail for salt]]\nMountain goats are herbivores and spend most of their time grazing. Their diets include [[grass]]es, [[herb]]s, [[Cyperaceae|sedges]], [[fern]]s, [[moss]]es, [[lichen]]s, and twigs and leaves from the low-growing shrubs and [[conifer]]s of their high-altitude habitat.\n\n[[File:Mountain goat at Mount Rushmore National Memorial.jpg|thumbnail|A mountain goat grazing at [[Mount Rushmore]], [[South Dakota]]]]\nIn captivity, the mountain goat's diet can also include grain, [[alfalfa]], fruits, vegetables and [[grass]].\n\n== Lifecycle and mating ==\n{{refimprove section|date=December 2013}}\nIn the wild, mountain goats usually live 12 to 15 years, with their lifespans limited by the wearing down of their teeth. In zoos, however, they can live for 16 to 20 years.\n\n[[File:Mountain goat kid.jpg|thumb|Mountain goat kid at Cawridge, Alberta]]\nMountain goats reach sexual maturity at about 30 months.<ref>D. Chadwick (1983). ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=SMnXTHE5iWMC&printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&q&f=false A Beast the Color of Winter \u2013 The Mountain Goat Observed]''. [[Sierra Club Books]]. San Francisco. 208 p.</ref> Nannies in a herd undergo synchronized [[estrus]] in late October through early December, at which time males and females participate in a mating ritual. Mature billies stare at nannies for long periods, dig rutting pits, and fight each other in showy (though occasionally dangerous) scuffles. Young billies sometimes try to participate, but they are ignored by nannies; nannies also sometimes pursue inattentive billies. Both males and females usually mate with multiple individuals during breeding season, although some billies try to keep other males away from certain nannies. After the breeding season is over, males and females move away from each other, with the adult billies breaking up into small bands of two or three individuals. Nannies form loose-knit nursery groups of up to 50 animals.\n\n[[File:Wherever you go I will go.JPG|thumb|right|Mountain goat with kid in [[Glacier National Park (U.S.)|Glacier National Park]]]]\nKids are born in the spring (late May or early June) after a six-month gestation period. Nannies give birth, usually to a single offspring, after moving to an isolated ledge;'' post partum'', they lick the kid dry and ingest the [[placenta]]. Kids weigh a little over {{Convert|3|kg}} at birth and begin to run and climb (or attempt to do so) within hours. Although they are mostly weaned within one month, kids follow their mothers closely for the first year of life (or until the nanny gives birth again, if this does not occur the next breeding season); nannies protect their young by leading them out of danger, standing over them when faced by predators, and positioning themselves below their kids on steep slopes to stop freefalls.\n\n== Aggressive behavior ==\nNannies can be very competitive and protective of their space and food sources.  They fight with one another for dominance in conflicts that can ultimately include all the nannies in the herd.  In these battles, nannies circle each other with their heads lowered, displaying their horns.  As with fights between billies during breeding season, these conflicts can occasionally lead to injury or death, but are usually harmless.  To avoid fighting, an animal may show a posture of nonaggression by stretching low to the ground.\n\nIn regions below the tree line, nannies use their fighting abilities to protect themselves and their offspring from predators. Predators, including [[Gray wolf|wolves]], [[wolverine]]s, [[Canadian lynx|lynx]]es, and [[bear]]s, attack goats of most ages given the opportunity. The [[cougar|mountain lion]] is perhaps the primary predator, being powerful enough to overwhelm the largest adults and uniquely nimble enough to navigate the rocky ecosystem of the goats. Though their size protects them from most potential predators in higher altitudes, nannies must sometimes defend their young from both [[bald eagle|bald]] and [[golden eagle]]s,<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Hamel|first1=Sandra|last2=C\u00f4t\u00e9|first2=Steeve D.|title=Maternal defensive behavior of mountain goats against predation by Golden Eagles|journal=Western North American Naturalist|date=2009|volume=69|issue=1|pages=115\u2013118|url=http://scholarsarchive.byu.edu/wnan/vol69/iss1/13|language=en|issn=1527-0904|doi=10.3398/064.069.0103}}</ref> which can be a predatory threat to kids.<ref name= ADW /> Nannies have even been observed trying to dominate the more passive, but often heavier [[bighorn sheep]] that share some of their territory.\n\nMountain goats can occasionally be aggressive towards humans, with at least one reported fatality resulting from an attack by a mountain goat.<ref>[http://www.seattlepi.com/local/428578_hiker17.html Hiker killed by mountain goat in Olympic Nat'l.

[[AllMusic]]'s David Jeffries praised the album for shedding Lloyd's thug image and replacing it with slow jams that come across as more convincing and sexy, saying that \"Lloyd is more comfortable, committed, and believable on ''Street Love'', and if taken in small doses, you can add satisfying to the list.\"<ref name=\"AM\"/> Mark Edward Nero of [[About.com]] also complimented the album for providing songs that will catch the public's attention but also said that its lacking in artistic quality, substance and vocal delivery, concluding with \"That said, the album isn't bad. Lloyd plays his role well and manages to come across as sensitive yet strong, and not as a sappy sucker.\"<ref name=\"About\"/> Adam Pearthree of [[Okayplayer]] said that despite faltering towards the end he praised the track variety throughout the record for having formulaic but attention-grabbing lyrical work, concluding that \"Those looking for the next great step forward in R&B will be sorely disappointed, but if you need to fill the gap in your life while waiting for a new [[Usher (singer)|Usher]] album, ''Street Love'' will not let you down.\"<ref name=\"Okay\"/> Andy Greenwald of ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' said that the album had potential but concluded with, \"Unfortunately, in between, Lloyd's talents are adrift on an ocean of samey slow jams.\"<ref name=\"EW\"/> Gentry Boeckel of ''[[PopMatters]]'' criticized the record for having an overabundance of slow-paced ballads, saying that \"Lloyd seems more interested in making staid, tried-and-true, music-that-will-get-me-laid music, rather than taking the style to new enclaves.\"<ref name=\"PM\"/>\n\n==Track listing==\n{{tracklist\n| extra_column = Producer(s)\n| title1 = Lloyd (Intro)\n| extra1 = [[Bryan-Michael Cox]]\n| length1 = 1:32\n| title2 = [[You (Lloyd song)|You]]\n| extra2 = [[Big Reese]], Jasper Cameron\n| length2 = 4:33\n| note2 = featuring [[Lil Wayne]]\n| title3 = Certified\n| extra3 = [[Jazze Pha]]\n| length3 = 4:32\n| title4 = I Don't Mind\n| extra4 = DJ Flash\n| length4 = 3:55\n| title5 = [[Get It Shawty]]\n| extra5 = J.

The said monument was supposed to be sponsored by The Chicago Daily Times whose goal was \u201cto commemorate one of the great epics in the struggle for human freedom\u2013the liberation of the Philippines.\u201d\n\nFast forward to 1950, the Boy Scouts of America was celebrating its 40th anniversary. Jack P. Whitaker, then Scout Commissioner of the Kansas City Area Council, had earlier suggested the creation and distribution of several Statue of Liberty replicas to all American states and territories, including the Philippines.\n\n[[File:Carlos P. Romulo (on the left) and Arthur A. Shuck.jpg|thumb|Chief Scout Executive Arthur A. Shuck presenting to [[Carlos P. Romulo]] a miniature of the Statue of Liberty in April 1950.]]\n\nThe eight-foot statues, which were cast in bronze, were distributed all over the U.S. and the world from 1949 to 1951. Almost 200 replicas were delivered to the 39 states of the U.S. and countries such as Panama and Puerto Rico. The [[Boy Scouts of the Philippines]], on the other hand, received its own replica in the early part of 1950.\n\nThe statues were donated by the Boy Scouts of America as \u201can expression of scout brotherhood and goodwill.\u201d Not surprisingly, their 40th anniversary theme was \u201cStrengthen the Arm of Liberty.\u201d\n\nMiniature versions of the statue were also given as gifts. In fact, the Philippines became the first independent nation to receive one of the 4,000 eight-inch statues from the Boy Scouts of America. In April 1950, the said statue was officially given by Chief Scout Executive Arthur A. Shuck to [[Carlos P. Romulo]], then chief of the Philippine Mission to the United Nations.\n\nIn the Philippines, several places were suggested as the site where the eight-foot bronze replica would be erected. The task of choosing the perfect site was delegated to the National Urban Planning Commission, and among those it considered were \u201cEngineer Island, atop the proposed reviewing stand on the [[Rizal Park]], and on the center island rotunda between the [[Old Legislative building]] and [[Manila City Hall]].\u201d\n\nIn the end, the [[Boy Scouts of the Philippines]] (BSP) erected the statue just outside [[Intramuros]]. As the icon of the United States, the replica of Lady Liberty would survive several attacks by student protesters in the 1960s. It remained standing until the early 1970s, when the BSP decided to transfer it to the Scout Reservation in [[Mt. Makiling]] which would serve as the statue's home for two decades or so.\n\nIn a 2002 article published by the Philippine Star, then BSP PR head Nixon Canlapan revealed that the Statue of Liberty was eventually moved and stored at the BSP headquarters on Concepcion Street (now Natividad Almeda-Lopez) in Ermita, Manila.\n\nTurns out, the American-sponsored replica was not the first Lady Liberty in [[Manila]]. In the 1930s, one of Manila's biggest shopping stores at that time became the talk of the town not just for its products but also for its unique multi-story building. Located in Juan Luna Street, the L.R. Aguinaldo's Emporium had an Art Deco facade featuring two contrasting statues: [[Andres Bonifacio]] on the right and the Statue of Liberty on the left.\n\n[[File:Souvenir postcard featuring the L.R. Aguinaldo Building in Juan Luna St., Manila.jpg|thumb|Established by the Philippine retailing pioneer Leopoldo R. Aguinaldo, the L.R. Aguinaldo's Emporium was once one of the biggest shopping stores in pre-war Manila, located in Juan Luna Street, Manila. The multi-story building's facade featured a statue of Andres Bonifacio on the right and a replica of the statue of Liberty on the left.]]\n\nEstablished by Philippine retailing pioneer Leopoldo R. Aguinaldo, the store would later become known as the Aguinaldo's Department Store. After the war, Leopoldo's son Francisco took over the business and the store was moved to Echague.\n\nThe Echague branch in the 1950s was known for introducing its customers to quality products both from the Philippines and abroad. It also commissioned young interior designers to update the store's furniture section. Thus, the store catapulted the careers of famous designers like Myra Cruz, Edgar Ramirez, and Bonnie Ramos, among others. Aguinaldo's succumbed to the competition and closed in the 1960s. The original building in Juan Luna Street still stands, along with both the Bonifacio and the Liberty statues.\n\nSince the creation of the Liberty statues in Intramuros and Juan Luna Street, other Philippine provinces soon followed suit. Statue of Liberty replicas in can be found in [[Pangasinan]] and as far as [[Camp John Hay]] amphitheater in [[Baguio City]].\n\n===Thailand===\n\nThe Mini Siam and Mini Europe [[Miniature park|model village]], in [[Pattaya]], has a miniature Statue of Liberty amongst others.\n\n===Taiwan===\nThere are at least two Statue of Liberty replicas (greater than 30 feet in height) in [[Taiwan]].

The said monument was supposed to be sponsored by The Chicago Daily Times whose goal was \u201cto commemorate one of the great epics in the struggle for human freedom\u2013the liberation of the Philippines.\u201d\n\nFast forward to 1950, the Boy Scouts of America was celebrating its 40th anniversary. Jack P. Whitaker, then Scout Commissioner of the Kansas City Area Council, had earlier suggested the creation and distribution of several Statue of Liberty replicas to all American states and territories, including the Philippines.\n\n[[File:Carlos P. Romulo (on the left) and Arthur A. Shuck.jpg|thumb|Chief Scout Executive Arthur A. Shuck presenting to [[Carlos P. Romulo]] a miniature of the Statue of Liberty in April 1950.]]\n\nThe eight-foot statues, which were cast in bronze, were distributed all over the U.S. and the world from 1949 to 1951. Almost 200 replicas were delivered to the 39 states of the U.S. and countries such as Panama and Puerto Rico. The [[Boy Scouts of the Philippines]], on the other hand, received its own replica in the early part of 1950.\n\nThe statues were donated by the Boy Scouts of America as \u201can expression of scout brotherhood and goodwill.\u201d Not surprisingly, their 40th anniversary theme was \u201cStrengthen the Arm of Liberty.\u201d\n\nMiniature versions of the statue were also given as gifts. In fact, the Philippines became the first independent nation to receive one of the 4,000 eight-inch statues from the Boy Scouts of America. In April 1950, the said statue was officially given by Chief Scout Executive Arthur A. Shuck to [[Carlos P. Romulo]], then chief of the Philippine Mission to the United Nations.\n\nIn the Philippines, several places were suggested as the site where the eight-foot bronze replica would be erected. The task of choosing the perfect site was delegated to the National Urban Planning Commission, and among those it considered were \u201cEngineer Island, atop the proposed reviewing stand on the [[Rizal Park]], and on the center island rotunda between the [[Old Legislative building]] and [[Manila City Hall]].\u201d\n\nIn the end, the [[Boy Scouts of the Philippines]] (BSP) erected the statue just outside [[Intramuros]]. As the icon of the United States, the replica of Lady Liberty would survive several attacks by student protesters in the 1960s. It remained standing until the early 1970s, when the BSP decided to transfer it to the Scout Reservation in [[Mt. Makiling]] which would serve as the statue's home for two decades or so.\n\nIn a 2002 article published by the Philippine Star, then BSP PR head Nixon Canlapan revealed that the Statue of Liberty was eventually moved and stored at the BSP headquarters on Concepcion Street (now Natividad Almeda-Lopez) in Ermita, Manila.\n\nTurns out, the American-sponsored replica was not the first Lady Liberty in [[Manila]]. In the 1930s, one of Manila's biggest shopping stores at that time became the talk of the town not just for its products but also for its unique multi-story building. Located in Juan Luna Street, the L.R. Aguinaldo's Emporium had an Art Deco facade featuring two contrasting statues: [[Andres Bonifacio]] on the right and the Statue of Liberty on the left.\n\n[[File:Souvenir postcard featuring the L.R. Aguinaldo Building in Juan Luna St., Manila.jpg|thumb|Established by the Philippine retailing pioneer Leopoldo R. Aguinaldo, the L.R. Aguinaldo's Emporium was once one of the biggest shopping stores in pre-war Manila, located in Juan Luna Street, Manila. The multi-story building's facade featured a statue of Andres Bonifacio on the right and a replica of the statue of Liberty on the left.]]\n\nEstablished by Philippine retailing pioneer Leopoldo R. Aguinaldo, the store would later become known as the Aguinaldo's Department Store. After the war, Leopoldo's son Francisco took over the business and the store was moved to Echague.\n\nThe Echague branch in the 1950s was known for introducing its customers to quality products both from the Philippines and abroad. It also commissioned young interior designers to update the store's furniture section. Thus, the store catapulted the careers of famous designers like Myra Cruz, Edgar Ramirez, and Bonnie Ramos, among others. Aguinaldo's succumbed to the competition and closed in the 1960s. The original building in Juan Luna Street still stands, along with both the Bonifacio and the Liberty statues.\n\nSince the creation of the Liberty statues in Intramuros and Juan Luna Street, other Philippine provinces soon followed suit. Statue of Liberty replicas in can be found in [[Pangasinan]] and as far as [[Camp John Hay]] amphitheater in [[Baguio City]].\n\n===Thailand===\n\nThe Mini Siam and Mini Europe [[Miniature park|model village]], in [[Pattaya]], has a miniature Statue of Liberty amongst others.\n\n===Taiwan===\nThere are at least two Statue of Liberty replicas (greater than 30 feet in height) in [[Taiwan]].

Johnston]] continued fighting.\n\nBooth shot President Lincoln once in the back of the head. Lincoln's death the next morning completed Booth's piece of the plot. Seward, severely wounded, recovered, whereas Vice President Johnson was never attacked. Booth fled on horseback to southern Maryland and, 12 days later, at a farm in rural northern [[Virginia]], was tracked down sheltered in a barn. Booth's [[David Herold|companion]] there surrendered, but Booth maintained a standoff. After the authorities set the barn ablaze, Union soldier [[Boston Corbett]] fatally shot him in the neck. Paralyzed, he died a few hours later.

Please do not unhide this without resolving all three of these major issues.\n===Evidence that shows Booth converted to Catholicism===\nThe editor's introduction of the 1874 memoir of Booth's sister [[Asia Booth|Asia Booth Clarke]] states that no individual church was preeminent in the Booth household during her childhood. Booth's mother was Episcopalian, and his father was described as a free spirit who was open to the great teachings of all religions.<ref name=Clarke42>Clarke, p. 16, 17</ref> On January 23, 1853, the 14-year-old Booth was [[Baptism|baptized]] at St. Timothy's [[Protestant Episcopal]] Church.<ref name=Clarke44 /> The Booth family had traditionally been Episcopalian. Clergyman [[Charles Chiniquy]] stated that Booth was a convert to [[Catholic Church|Roman Catholicism]] later in life. Historian Constance Head also declared that Booth was of this religion. She wrote the paper \"Insights on John Wilkes Booth from His Sister Asia's Correspondence\" (1982) published in the ''Lincoln Herald'', in which she quotes from a letter of Booth's sister Asia Booth Clarke, in which she wrote that her brother was a Roman Catholic. (Asia Booth Clarke's memoir was published after her death.)\n\nTerry Alford, a college history professor and a leading authority on Booth's life,<ref name=Clarke43>Clarke, dust jacket, back inner sleeve</ref> has stated, \"Asia Booth Clarke's memoir of her brother John Wilkes Booth has been recognized as the single most important document available for understanding the personality of the assassin of President Abraham Lincoln\", and \"no outsider could give such insights into the turbulent Booth's childhood or share such unique personal knowledge of the gifted actor\".

Accessed July 12, 2011.</ref> Although its [[Army of Northern Virginia]], commanded by [[General Robert E. Lee]], had surrendered to the [[Union Army]] four days earlier, Booth believed that the [[American Civil War|Civil War]] remained unresolved because the Confederate army of General [[Joseph E. Johnston]] continued fighting.\n\nBooth shot President Lincoln once in the back of the head. Lincoln's death the next morning completed Booth's piece of the plot. Seward, severely wounded, recovered, whereas Vice President Johnson was never attacked. Booth fled on horseback to southern Maryland and, 12 days later, at a farm in rural northern [[Virginia]], was tracked down sheltered in a barn.

Please do not unhide this without resolving all three of these major issues.\n===Evidence that shows Booth converted to Catholicism===\nThe editor's introduction of the 1874 memoir of Booth's sister [[Asia Booth|Asia Booth Clarke]] states that no individual church was preeminent in the Booth household during her childhood. Booth's mother was Episcopalian, and his father was described as a free spirit who was open to the great teachings of all religions.<ref name=Clarke42>Clarke, p. 16, 17</ref> On January 23, 1853, the 14-year-old Booth was [[Baptism|baptized]] at St. Timothy's [[Protestant Episcopal]] Church.<ref name=Clarke44 /> The Booth family had traditionally been Episcopalian. Clergyman [[Charles Chiniquy]] stated that Booth was a convert to [[Catholic Church|Roman Catholicism]] later in life. Historian Constance Head also declared that Booth was of this religion. She wrote the paper \"Insights on John Wilkes Booth from His Sister Asia's Correspondence\" (1982) published in the ''Lincoln Herald'', in which she quotes from a letter of Booth's sister Asia Booth Clarke, in which she wrote that her brother was a Roman Catholic. (Asia Booth Clarke's memoir was published after her death.)\n\nTerry Alford, a college history professor and a leading authority on Booth's life,<ref name=Clarke43>Clarke, dust jacket, back inner sleeve</ref> has stated, \"Asia Booth Clarke's memoir of her brother John Wilkes Booth has been recognized as the single most important document available for understanding the personality of the assassin of President Abraham Lincoln\", and \"no outsider could give such insights into the turbulent Booth's childhood or share such unique personal knowledge of the gifted actor\". Testimony given at the trial of John Surratt showed that at his death, Booth had a Catholic medal on his person. Court evidence showed his attending a Roman Catholic church service on at least two occasions. Like his sister Asia, he received education at a school established by an official of the Catholic Church.\n\nConstance Head states, \"In any case, it seems certain that Booth did not publicize his conversion during his lifetime. And while there is no reasonable cause to connect Booth's religious preference and his 'mad act', the few who knew of his conversion must have decided after the assassination that for the good of the church, it was best never to mention it. Thus the secret remained so well guarded that even the most rabidly [[Anti-Catholicism|anti-Catholic]] writers who tried to depict the assassination of Lincoln as a [[Society of Jesus|Jesuit]] or [[Pope|Papist]] plot were puzzled by the seemingly accurate information that John Wilkes Booth was an Episcopalian.\"<ref name=Clarke542>Clarke, pp. 542, 543</ref><ref>{{cite news|first=Constance|last=Head|title=Insights on John Wilkes Booth From His Sister Asia's Correspondence|newspaper=[[Lincoln Herald]]|publisher=Herald News|location=Lincolnton, North Carolina|date=Winter 1980|volume=82|issue=4|pages=542, 543}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |first=Paul|last=Serup |title=Who Killed Abraham Lincoln?: An investigation of North America's most famous ex-priest's assertion that the Roman Catholic Church was behind the assassination of America's greatest President |publisher=[[Salmova Press]]|location=Prince George British Columbia, Canada|date=2010 |isbn= 978-0-9811685-0-0|pages=144\u2013146, 382 }}</ref>--->\n\n==Theatrical career==\n===1850s===\n[[File:Richmond Theatre (VA) in 1858.jpg|thumb|The Richmond Theatre, [[Richmond, Virginia]] in 1858, when Booth made his first stage appearance there]]\nBooth made his stage debut at age 17 on August 14, 1855 in the supporting role of the Earl of Richmond in ''[[Richard III (play)|Richard III]]'' at Baltimore's Charles Street Theatre.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://ghostsofbaltimore.org/2013/09/09/original-ad-john-wilkes-booths-acting-debut/|title=Original Ad For John Wilkes Booth's Acting Debut|last=Tom|date=2013-09-09|website=Ghosts of Baltimore|language=en-US|access-date=2019-02-17}}</ref><ref name=Smith61>Smith, pp. 61\u201362.</ref><ref>Kauffman, ''American Brutus'', p. 95.</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Original Ad for John Wilkes Booth's Acting Debut|url=http://ghostsofbaltimore.org/2013/09/09/original-ad-john-wilkes-booths-acting-debut/|publisher=Ghosts of Baltimore|accessdate=September 9, 2013}}</ref> The audience jeered at him when he missed some of his lines.<ref name=Smith61 /><ref name=Bishop2>{{cite book|last=Bishop|first=Jim|authorlink=Jim Bishop|title=The Day Lincoln Was Shot|url=https://archive.org/details/daylincolnwassho00bish|url-access=registration|publisher=Harper & Row|year=1955|pages=[https://archive.org/details/daylincolnwassho00bish/page/63 63\u201364]|lccn=54012170}}</ref> He also began acting at Baltimore's [[Holliday Street Theater]], owned by [[John T.
