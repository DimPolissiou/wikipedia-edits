Harry is now working in a desk job as the Head of Magical Law Enforcement at the [[Ministry of Magic]], while Ginny is the editor of the sports section of ''[[The Daily Prophet]]''. [[Ron Weasley]] and [[Hermione Granger]] also send their daughter [[Rose Granger-Weasley]] on the train. Hermione is now [[Minister for Magic]], while Ron manages [[Weasley's Wizard Wheezes]] in [[Diagon Alley]]. On their first trip to Hogwarts aboard the Hogwarts\u2019 Express, Albus makes an unlikely friendship in [[Scorpius Malfoy]], the son of Harry's former nemesis [[Draco Malfoy]] and Astoria Malfoy (n\u00e9e Greengrass). The school is stunned when, in a break with the tradition of Potters being sorted into [[Gryffindor]], Albus is sorted into [[Slytherin]] alongside Scorpius.\n\nBoth boys are bullied by other students over the next few years, Albus due to his perceived failure to live up to his parents, Scorpius due to unproven rumours that he is the son of [[Lord Voldemort]]. Scorpius's mother Astoria then passes away due to a fatal disease. In addition, Albus and Harry begin to drift apart, owing to Albus's struggles with his father's shadow and Harry's uncertainty on how to deal with his son's issues. Albus also drifts apart from his cousin Rose, with whom he was close before meeting Scorpius. Prior to Albus and Scorpius's fourth year, Albus gets into a fight with his father after he is given Harry's baby blanket and a [[Amortentia|love potion]] from Ron. During the fight, Harry says that he sometimes wishes Albus was not his son, and Albus spills the potion on the blanket.\n\nHarry obtains a prototype of a more powerful version of the [[Time-Turner]], built by a Slytherin contemporary of Harry's, Theodore Nott, that allows one to travel back into the past and change history. Simultaneously, Harry's scar starts hurting again, causing him to become concerned that Voldemort may be returning. [[Amos Diggory]], who has become old and is cared for by his niece, Delphi Diggory, asks Harry to use the Time-Turner to prevent the death of his son, [[Cedric Diggory]]. After overhearing Harry refuse to help the Diggorys, Albus is inspired to do so himself and convinces Scorpius to help him. The two escape from the Hogwarts Express and the trolley witch. The two arrive at St.&nbsp;Oswald's Home for Old Witches and Wizards in [[Yorkshire]], where Amos lives, and team up with Delphi to steal the Time-Turner from Hermione's office, in the Ministry of Magic, while disguised with [[Polyjuice Potion]].\n\n===Act Two===\nKnowing that Cedric's death was the result of him winning the Triwizard Tournament<ref name=\":0\" /> alongside Harry, the boys use the Time-Turner to travel back to the first tournament challenge in 1994. The two disguise themselves as Durmstrang students in an attempt to sabotage Cedric to prevent his victory. The plan fails, and the disguises cause Hermione to become suspicious of Viktor Krum, a Durmstrang student, and goes to the Yule Ball with Ron instead. As a result, Ron never experiences the jealousy fundamental to his relationship with Hermione and the two never marry. Ron instead falls in love with Padma Patil at the Ball and Hermione becomes a frustrated and mean professor at Hogwarts, teaching Defense Against the Dark Arts.\n\nMeanwhile, Harry has nightmares about Voldemort as he grows suspicious that the wizard will return. A centaur named Bane tells Harry that a \"dark cloud\" is around Albus. Convinced that Scorpius is a threat to Albus, Harry tries to have the boys kept apart at Hogwarts by attempting to force [[headteacher|Headmistress]] [[Minerva McGonagall]] to keep tabs on Albus using the [[Marauder's Map]].\n\nAlbus and Scorpius's friendship is destroyed, but the two eventually reconcile after Albus steals Harry's old [[Invisibility cloak (Harry Potter)|Invisibility Cloak]] from Albus\u2019s older brother [[James Sirius Potter|James Sirius]]. Harry is persuaded to relent after a conversation with Draco and Ginny. Meanwhile, Albus and Scorpius decide to make another attempt to use the Time-Turner to change Cedric's fate, this time by humiliating him during the Triwizard Tournament's second task. When Scorpius returns to the present day, however, Albus is not with him.  [[Dolores Umbridge]] walks up to him and reveals that Harry is dead and Lord Voldemort rules the [[Fictional universe of Harry Potter|wizarding world]].  Scorpius follows Umbridge back to Hogwarts as Dementors fly around the auditorium and a banner with the Dark Mark is revealed.\n\n===Act Three===\nScorpius discovers that \u2013 as a result of his actions \u2013 an embittered Cedric joined the [[Death Eater]]s and killed [[Neville Longbottom]] during the events of ''Deathly Hallows'', preventing him from killing [[Nagini (Harry Potter)|Nagini]] and allowing Voldemort to win the [[Battle of Hogwarts]]. With Harry now dead, Albus subsequently never existed, while Voldemort was able to completely consolidate power and transform the Ministry of Magic into a [[dictatorial]] regime. In the new timeline, Scorpius became a popular Head Boy and [[Quidditch]] star, helping the staff and students torment Muggle-borns. [[Dolores Umbridge]] became the new Headmistress of Hogwarts, and patrols the school with [[Dementors]] and a revived Inquisitorial Squad led by Scorpius. Draco Malfoy occupies Harry's old position as the Head of Magical Law Enforcement, using his post to encourage routine attacks on Muggles and bribe the [[Prime Minister (UK)|Prime Minister]] to remain silent on the actions of the Death Eaters.\n\nA powerful dark figure called \"The Augurey\" leads the Ministry of Magic. With help from Ron, Hermione, and [[Severus Snape]], now the final members of a dwindling anti-Voldemort resistance movement, Scorpius is able to use the Time-Turner to prevent the interference of Albus and his past self and restore the events of the original timeline, the alternate Ron, Hermione, and Snape sacrificing themselves to the Dementors in order to allow him to do so. Scorpius reunites with Albus, and the two boys are eventually found by their parents, as well as Ron and Hermione. Following these events, Harry scolds Albus for his actions, but the two nevertheless begin to reconcile.\n\nRealising the danger the Time-Turner poses and deciding their parents will continue to keep it (as Hermione had done in the Ministry of Magic), Scorpius and Albus attempt to destroy it themselves, but they are joined by Delphi Diggory. Scorpius realizes that Delphi was in charge of the Ministry of Magic in the alternate timeline (from her tattoo of the wings of a magical bird, which she says is called an Augurey), and she takes them captive, later revealing her intention of restoring the alternate timeline. A fellow student, Craig Bowker&nbsp;Jr., tries to intervene as Delphi holds Albus and Scorpius captive on the Quidditch pitch, and Delphi murders him.\n\nAfter Ron reveals he saw Albus and Scorpius with Delphi while he was in Hogsmeade with Neville Longbottom, Harry and Draco confront Amos, only to discover Delphi is not his niece, but had placed Amos under a \"confundus\" charm. Delphi takes the boys to the final challenge of the Triwizard Tournament, but Albus and Scorpius prevent her from acting, and Delphi uses the Time-Turner again to travel further back in time. She inadvertently takes the boys with her and then destroys the Time-Turner to leave them all stranded in time.\n\nSearching Delphi's room, Harry, Draco, Ginny, Hermione, and Ron discover hidden writing on the walls describing a prophecy that will allow Voldemort to return.  Draco questions why she would be so obsessed with Voldemort's return, as Ginny finds writing on the ceiling that reveals Delphi is the daughter of Voldemort.\n\nIn a real world depiction corresponding to the change in history, the concession store in the foyer of the theatre also changes, and sells shirts, mugs, hoodies and other memorabilia with Voldemort logos, not available during Acts One and Two.\n\n===Act Four===\nAbandoned by Delphi in the past, Albus and Scorpius discover they have been taken back to the night before Harry's parents were killed at [[Godric's Hollow]] (31&nbsp;October 1981), and assume Delphi is planning to kill Harry before Voldemort attempts to do so (which severely weakens Voldemort). Albus and Scorpius write an invisible message on Harry's baby blanket, knowing in the present (which is now also the night of the anniversary of the death of Harry's parents, when he often looks for his blanket as it is the only physical memento he has), the blanket would become stained with love potion and expose the message to Harry.\n\nMeanwhile, Draco reveals the Time-Turner was actually a prototype for a perfected model owned by him (it was made for his father), but they remain unable to rescue the boys due to their uncertainty over which time period they have entered. After Harry receives the message from the boys, he and his allies use Draco's Time-Turner to travel back in time to save them and stop Delphi. While waiting for Delphi, they deduce she intends to convince Voldemort to abandon his doomed attempt to kill Harry, ensuring her father's survival and allowing her to be with him.\n\nHarry disguises himself as Voldemort using Transfiguration to distract Delphi, during which Delphi reveals that [[Bellatrix Lestrange]] is her mother and after a struggle, the group manages to subdue her. Rather than killing Delphi, it is decided that she will be brought to [[Azkaban Prison]]. Lord Voldemort then appears and is oblivious to the presence of Harry and the group. The group allows the murder of Harry's parents to play out again, unwilling to risk the consequences of altering the past.\n\nThey all stand with Harry to watch the sad event replay. After returning to the present day, Delphi is sent to Azkaban. Albus and Scorpius now decide to be more active at Hogwarts, with Scorpius expressing interest in trying out for Quidditch and asking Rose on a date. Harry and Albus visit Cedric's grave, with Harry apologizing for his role in Cedric's death.\n\n==Productions==\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:left\"\n|-\n! style=\"text-align:left\"|Production \n! style=\"text-align:left\"|Venue/Location\n! style=\"text-align:left\"|First Preview\n! style=\"text-align:left\"|Opening Night\n! style=\"text-align:left\"|Closing Night\n|-\n| West End (London) || [[Palace Theatre, London|Palace Theatre]] || 7 June 2016 (Part One), 9 June 2016 (Part Two) || 30 July 2016 || '''Currently running''' \n|-\n| Broadway (New York) || [[Lyric Theatre (1998 New York City)|Lyric Theatre]] || 16 March 2018 (Part One), 17 March 2018 (Part Two) || 22 April 2018 || '''Currently running'''\n|-\n| Melbourne || [[Princess Theatre (Melbourne)|Princess Theatre]] || 18 January 2019 (Part One), 19 January 2019 (Part Two) || 23 February 2019 || '''Currently running'''\n|-\n| San Francisco || [[Curran Theatre]] || 23 October 2019 (Part One), 24 October 2019 (Part Two) || 1 December 2019 || '''Currently running'''\n|-\n| Hamburg || [[Mehr!

Harry is now working in a desk job as the Head of Magical Law Enforcement at the [[Ministry of Magic]], while Ginny is the editor of the sports section of ''[[The Daily Prophet]]''. [[Ron Weasley]] and [[Hermione Granger]] also send their daughter [[Rose Granger-Weasley]] on the train. Hermione is now [[Minister for Magic]], while Ron manages [[Weasley's Wizard Wheezes]] in [[Diagon Alley]]. On their first trip to Hogwarts aboard the Hogwarts\u2019 Express, Albus makes an unlikely friendship in [[Scorpius Malfoy]], the son of Harry's former nemesis [[Draco Malfoy]] and Astoria Malfoy (n\u00e9e Greengrass). The school is stunned when, in a break with the tradition of Potters being sorted into [[Gryffindor]], Albus is sorted into [[Slytherin]] alongside Scorpius.\n\nBoth boys are bullied by other students over the next few years, Albus due to his perceived failure to live up to his parents, Scorpius due to unproven rumours that he is the son of [[Lord Voldemort]]. Scorpius's mother Astoria then passes away due to a fatal disease. In addition, Albus and Harry begin to drift apart, owing to Albus's struggles with his father's shadow and Harry's uncertainty on how to deal with his son's issues. Albus also drifts apart from his cousin Rose, with whom he was close before meeting Scorpius. Prior to Albus and Scorpius's fourth year, Albus gets into a fight with his father after he is given Harry's baby blanket and a [[Amortentia|love potion]] from Ron. During the fight, Harry says that he sometimes wishes Albus was not his son, and Albus spills the potion on the blanket.\n\nHarry obtains a prototype of a more powerful version of the [[Time-Turner]], built by a Slytherin contemporary of Harry's, Theodore Nott, that allows one to travel back into the past and change history. Simultaneously, Harry's scar starts hurting again, causing him to become concerned that Voldemort may be returning. [[Amos Diggory]], who has become old and is cared for by his niece, Delphi Diggory, asks Harry to use the Time-Turner to prevent the death of his son, [[Cedric Diggory]]. After overhearing Harry refuse to help the Diggorys, Albus is inspired to do so himself and convinces Scorpius to help him. The two escape from the Hogwarts Express and the trolley witch. The two arrive at St.&nbsp;Oswald's Home for Old Witches and Wizards in [[Yorkshire]], where Amos lives, and team up with Delphi to steal the Time-Turner from Hermione's office, in the Ministry of Magic, while disguised with [[Polyjuice Potion]].\n\n===Act Two===\nKnowing that Cedric's death was the result of him winning the Triwizard Tournament<ref name=\":0\" /> alongside Harry, the boys use the Time-Turner to travel back to the first tournament challenge in 1994. The two disguise themselves as Durmstrang students in an attempt to sabotage Cedric to prevent his victory. The plan fails, and the disguises cause Hermione to become suspicious of Viktor Krum, a Durmstrang student, and goes to the Yule Ball with Ron instead. As a result, Ron never experiences the jealousy fundamental to his relationship with Hermione and the two never marry. Ron instead falls in love with Padma Patil at the Ball and Hermione becomes a frustrated and mean professor at Hogwarts, teaching Defense Against the Dark Arts.\n\nMeanwhile, Harry has nightmares about Voldemort as he grows suspicious that the wizard will return. A centaur named Bane tells Harry that a \"dark cloud\" is around Albus. Convinced that Scorpius is a threat to Albus, Harry tries to have the boys kept apart at Hogwarts by attempting to force [[headteacher|Headmistress]] [[Minerva McGonagall]] to keep tabs on Albus using the [[Marauder's Map]].\n\nAlbus and Scorpius's friendship is destroyed, but the two eventually reconcile after Albus steals Harry's old [[Invisibility cloak (Harry Potter)|Invisibility Cloak]] from Albus\u2019s older brother [[James Sirius Potter|James Sirius]]. Harry is persuaded to relent after a conversation with Draco and Ginny. Meanwhile, Albus and Scorpius decide to make another attempt to use the Time-Turner to change Cedric's fate, this time by humiliating him during the Triwizard Tournament's second task. When Scorpius returns to the present day, however, Albus is not with him.  [[Dolores Umbridge]] walks up to him and reveals that Harry is dead and Lord Voldemort rules the [[Fictional universe of Harry Potter|wizarding world]].  Scorpius follows Umbridge back to Hogwarts as Dementors fly around the auditorium and a banner with the Dark Mark is revealed.\n\n===Act Three===\nScorpius discovers that \u2013 as a result of his actions \u2013 an embittered Cedric joined the [[Death Eater]]s and killed [[Neville Longbottom]] during the events of ''Deathly Hallows'', preventing him from killing [[Nagini (Harry Potter)|Nagini]] and allowing Voldemort to win the [[Battle of Hogwarts]]. With Harry now dead, Albus subsequently never existed, while Voldemort was able to completely consolidate power and transform the Ministry of Magic into a [[dictatorial]] regime. In the new timeline, Scorpius became a popular Head Boy and [[Quidditch]] star, helping the staff and students torment Muggle-borns. [[Dolores Umbridge]] became the new Headmistress of Hogwarts, and patrols the school with [[Dementors]] and a revived Inquisitorial Squad led by Scorpius. Draco Malfoy occupies Harry's old position as the Head of Magical Law Enforcement, using his post to encourage routine attacks on Muggles and bribe the [[Prime Minister (UK)|Prime Minister]] to remain silent on the actions of the Death Eaters.\n\nA powerful dark figure called \"The Augurey\" leads the Ministry of Magic. With help from Ron, Hermione, and [[Severus Snape]], now the final members of a dwindling anti-Voldemort resistance movement, Scorpius is able to use the Time-Turner to prevent the interference of Albus and his past self and restore the events of the original timeline, the alternate Ron, Hermione, and Snape sacrificing themselves to the Dementors in order to allow him to do so. Scorpius reunites with Albus, and the two boys are eventually found by their parents, as well as Ron and Hermione. Following these events, Harry scolds Albus for his actions, but the two nevertheless begin to reconcile.\n\nRealising the danger the Time-Turner poses and deciding their parents will continue to keep it (as Hermione had done in the Ministry of Magic), Scorpius and Albus attempt to destroy it themselves, but they are joined by Delphi Diggory. Scorpius realizes that Delphi was in charge of the Ministry of Magic in the alternate timeline (from her tattoo of the wings of a magical bird, which she says is called an Augurey), and she takes them captive, later revealing her intention of restoring the alternate timeline. A fellow student, Craig Bowker&nbsp;Jr., tries to intervene as Delphi holds Albus and Scorpius captive on the Quidditch pitch, and Delphi murders him.\n\nAfter Ron reveals he saw Albus and Scorpius with Delphi while he was in Hogsmeade with Neville Longbottom, Harry and Draco confront Amos, only to discover Delphi is not his niece, but had placed Amos under a \"confundus\" charm. Delphi takes the boys to the final challenge of the Triwizard Tournament, but Albus and Scorpius prevent her from acting, and Delphi uses the Time-Turner again to travel further back in time. She inadvertently takes the boys with her and then destroys the Time-Turner to leave them all stranded in time.\n\nSearching Delphi's room, Harry, Draco, Ginny, Hermione, and Ron discover hidden writing on the walls describing a prophecy that will allow Voldemort to return.  Draco questions why she would be so obsessed with Voldemort's return, as Ginny finds writing on the ceiling that reveals Delphi is the daughter of Voldemort.\n\nIn a real world depiction corresponding to the change in history, the concession store in the foyer of the theatre also changes, and sells shirts, mugs, hoodies and other memorabilia with Voldemort logos, not available during Acts One and Two.\n\n===Act Four===\nAbandoned by Delphi in the past, Albus and Scorpius discover they have been taken back to the night before Harry's parents were killed at [[Godric's Hollow]] (31&nbsp;October 1981), and assume Delphi is planning to kill Harry before Voldemort attempts to do so (which severely weakens Voldemort). Albus and Scorpius write an invisible message on Harry's baby blanket, knowing in the present (which is now also the night of the anniversary of the death of Harry's parents, when he often looks for his blanket as it is the only physical memento he has), the blanket would become stained with love potion and expose the message to Harry.\n\nMeanwhile, Draco reveals the Time-Turner was actually a prototype for a perfected model owned by him (it was made for his father), but they remain unable to rescue the boys due to their uncertainty over which time period they have entered. After Harry receives the message from the boys, he and his allies use Draco's Time-Turner to travel back in time to save them and stop Delphi. While waiting for Delphi, they deduce she intends to convince Voldemort to abandon his doomed attempt to kill Harry, ensuring her father's survival and allowing her to be with him.\n\nHarry disguises himself as Voldemort using Transfiguration to distract Delphi, during which Delphi reveals that [[Bellatrix Lestrange]] is her mother and after a struggle, the group manages to subdue her. Rather than killing Delphi, it is decided that she will be brought to [[Azkaban Prison]]. Lord Voldemort then appears and is oblivious to the presence of Harry and the group. The group allows the murder of Harry's parents to play out again, unwilling to risk the consequences of altering the past.\n\nThey all stand with Harry to watch the sad event replay. After returning to the present day, Delphi is sent to Azkaban. Albus and Scorpius now decide to be more active at Hogwarts, with Scorpius expressing interest in trying out for Quidditch and asking Rose on a date. Harry and Albus visit Cedric's grave, with Harry apologizing for his role in Cedric's death.\n\n==Productions==\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:left\"\n|-\n! style=\"text-align:left\"|Production \n! style=\"text-align:left\"|Venue/Location\n! style=\"text-align:left\"|First Preview\n! style=\"text-align:left\"|Opening Night\n! style=\"text-align:left\"|Closing Night\n|-\n| West End (London) || [[Palace Theatre, London|Palace Theatre]] || 7 June 2016 (Part One), 9 June 2016 (Part Two) || 30 July 2016 || '''Currently running''' \n|-\n| Broadway (New York) || [[Lyric Theatre (1998 New York City)|Lyric Theatre]] || 16 March 2018 (Part One), 17 March 2018 (Part Two) || 22 April 2018 || '''Currently running'''\n|-\n| Melbourne || [[Princess Theatre (Melbourne)|Princess Theatre]] || 18 January 2019 (Part One), 19 January 2019 (Part Two) || 23 February 2019 || '''Currently running'''\n|-\n| San Francisco || [[Curran Theatre]] || 23 October 2019 (Part One), 24 October 2019 (Part Two) || 1 December 2019 || '''Currently running'''\n|-\n| Hamburg || [[Mehr!

[[Land and Property Services Northern Ireland|Land and Property Services]] maintain records for Northern Ireland.\n\n==Purpose==\n[[File:Croydon-wiki.jpg|thumb|Trafalgar House, Bedford Park, Croydon, Greater London; HM Land Registry Head Office and Croydon Local Office]]\nHM Land Registry registers the ownership of property. It is one of the largest property databases in Europe. At the peak of the property boom in 2007, \u00a31 million worth of property was processed every minute in England and Wales.<ref>Collis, Peter (April 2006) [https://web.archive.org/web/20070602044143/http://www.landregistry.gov.uk/strategy/10yearplan/ Welcome to Land Registry\u2019s 10-year strategic plan]. landregistry.gov.uk</ref>\n\nLike [[land registration]] organisations in other countries, HM Land Registry guarantees [[Title (property)|title]] to registered estates and interests in land. It records the ownership rights of [[Freehold (English law)|freehold]] properties, and [[leasehold]] properties where the lease has been granted for a term exceeding seven years.\n\nThe definition of land can include the buildings situated upon the land, particularly where parts of buildings at different levels (such as flats) are in different ownership. It is also possible to register the ownership of the mines and minerals which lie within the ground, as well as airspace above property where this is in separate ownership.\n\nHM Land Registry receives no government funding, being required to ensure that its income covers expenditure, and finances itself from registration and search fees. It provides online access to its database of ''titles'' (ownership and ''charges'' or interests by other parties) and most ''plans'' (maps). People need to pay a fee to access some information.\n\nProperty owners whose property is not registered can make voluntary applications for registration. As of March 2016, there are 24.5 million registered titles representing 88%<ref>[https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/land-registry-annual-report-and-accounts-2015-to-2016/annual-report-and-accounts-2015-to-2016 HM Land Registry Annual Report 2015-2016]</ref> of the land mass of England and Wales. Registration of land under the [[Land Registration Act 2002]] affords property owners some protection against squatters as well as avoiding the need to produce old documents each time a property changes hands.\n\n==Benefits of land registration==\nAccording to HM Land Registry:<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.landregistry.gov.uk/register-land/voluntary-registration-a-guide-for-solicitors-and-property-professionals|archive-url=http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20140709064818/http://www.landregistry.gov.uk/register-land/voluntary-registration-a-guide-for-solicitors-and-property-professionals|url-status=dead|archive-date=2014-07-09|title=[ARCHIVED CONTENT] UK Government Web Archive \u2013 The National Archives|last=Foundation|first=Internet Memory|website=webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk|access-date=2017-02-13}}</ref>\n\n{{cquote\n|Registration establishes proof of ownership and produces an easy-to-read document reflecting the contents of all the paper title deeds. This simplifies conveyancing, making transactions easier and potentially less costly for all involved.\n\nAll title information is kept on HM Land Registry's database, reducing the need to store old and often unclear deeds.  The register can be viewed quickly and securely online.\n\nThere is no better way to safeguard ownership of land and property than by registering your title with us. State-backed registration gives you greater security of title, providing you with better protection against claims of adverse possession}}\n\nRegistering a title provides a \"Title Plan\" which is normally not definitive, but which identifies the land within the title on the Ordnance Survey map. It is important that the original title deeds are retained as they will provide a starting point if ever it is necessary to identify the precise position of the boundaries.{{citation needed|date=May 2016}}\n\nIn addition to being the government body that registers the ownership of land and property in England and Wales, HM Land Registry is also a useful tool for property investors who use the online price calculator to query the latest monthly residential property prices. The government is also using the land registry data to assess property values for tax purposes.<ref name=\"blog.thenello.com\">{{cite web |url=http://blog.thenello.com/how-the-best-investors-are-using-the-land-registry-to-find-their-next-investment-property// |title=How the best investors are using the land registry to find their next investment property |publisher=http://blog.thenello.com/ |date= |access-date=2015-08-31 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150825070848/http://blog.thenello.com/how-the-best-investors-are-using-the-land-registry-to-find-their-next-investment-property/ |archive-date=25 August 2015 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\n==Offices==\nHM Land Registry has 14 offices at: [[Birkenhead]], [[Coventry]], [[Croydon]], [[Durham, England|Durham]], [[The Fylde|Fylde]] ([[Warton, Fylde|Warton]]), [[Gloucester]], [[Kingston upon Hull]], [[Leicester]], [[Nottingham]], [[Peterborough]], [[Plymouth]], [[Swansea]], [[Telford]] and [[Weymouth, Dorset|Weymouth]].\n\nHM Land Registry's Head Office is based in Croydon. The in-house IT department (Information Systems) and Land Charges Departments are based in Plymouth.\n\nIn 2006, as a result of a review of office accommodation, HM Land Registry announced the closure of several offices. This involved merging offices in Birkenhead, Durham, Lytham/Warton, Nottingham and Swansea, and closing of offices in [[London Borough of Harrow|Harrow]] and [[York]].\n\nA further review of staffing levels and overall office space began in 2009. The economic recession and lower volumes of property sales and mortgages meant that HM Land Registry's basic work in connection with remortgages and house sales reduced to the point where it made a financial loss for the first time in many years. HM Land Registry announced proposals to close five offices at [[Portsmouth]], [[Tunbridge Wells]], [[Croydon]], [[Stevenage]] and [[Peterborough]].<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20110720234338/http://www1.landregistry.gov.uk/upload/documents/ATP_Consultation_Doc_V1.0_221009_Issued.pdf Land Registry's Accelerated Transformation Programme \u2013 Consultation on office closures].

The Chief Land Registrar is assisted by the HM Land Registry Board and Executive Board.  The HM Land Registry Board sets the overall strategy for the department.

Under previous legislation this function had been the responsibility of the Chief Land Registrar. From July 2013, the functions of the Adjudicator have been transferred to the Land Registration division of the Property Chamber of the [[First-tier Tribunal]].\n\n==History==\n[[File:HM Land Registry entrance.jpg|thumb|Former Land Registry Head Office, [[32 Lincoln's Inn Fields]] (1913\u20132011)]]\nIn 1857 the Royal Commission on Registration of Title proposed a system of registration administered by a central registry in London with district offices. The [[Land Registry Act 1862]] was introduced by the then [[Lord Chancellor]], [[Richard Bethell, 1st Baron Westbury]]. The Act provided for the registration of [[freehold (English law)|freehold]] and long [[leasehold]] estates in land. The system of registration adopted had some differences to that piloted in [[South Australia]] by that colony's then Premier Sir [[Robert Richard Torrens|Robert Torrens]], although both were founded on the 1857 report.\n\n[[Brent Spencer Follett]], the first Chief Land Registrar, opened the Land Registry's first offices, at 34 Lincoln's Inn Fields, London, on 15 October 1862. Mr Follett had a staff of just six people and was paid \u00a32,500 a year, at a time when the average labourer's wage was \u00a340.<ref>British Labour Statistics: Historical Abstracts, 1886\u20131968, quoted in [http://privatewww.essex.ac.uk/~alan/family/N-Money.html#DoEP Essex University research].  Retrieved 10 October 2011.</ref>\n\nAt first, registration was not compulsory, and once property was registered there was no compulsion to register any subsequent transactions. Thus it was possible for the person registered as the owner of a property to cease to be the owner while remaining on the register. Serious flaws in the 1862 Act led to the Land Transfer Act 1875, which forms the basis of the system used today. However, the LTA did not make registration compulsory.\n\nA report by Sir [[Charles Brickdale]] on the system of land registration used in Germany proved influential. In 1897 the then Lord Chancellor, [[Hardinge Giffard, 1st Earl of Halsbury]] introduced the Land Transfer Act 1897, which brought an element of compulsion into the registration system. To satisfy the demands of the legal profession, the option of a county veto was offered.\n\nLondon County Council was attracted to the idea of compulsory registration and voted in favour of it. It was introduced in stages between 1899 and 1902 and this led to the expansion of HM Land Registry. Also at this time, the first female staff were employed and typewriters were introduced. A proposal to extend compulsory registration to Northamptonshire in 1902 was lost in committee.\n\nFrom 1905 to 1913 new HM Land Registry headquarters were built in Lincoln's Inn Fields.\n\nTwo significant pieces of land legislation were enacted in 1925: the Law of Property Act and the Land Registration Act. Government-initiated extensions to compulsory registration were suspended for ten years, but [[Eastbourne]] (1926) and [[Hastings]] (1929) voluntarily became areas of compulsory registration. After the ten years were up, compulsory registration was extended to [[Middlesex]] (1937) and the County Borough of [[Croydon]] (1939). Plans to extend it to Surrey in 1940 were abandoned due to the [[Second World War]]. In 1925 the government forecast that the whole of England and Wales would be subject to compulsory registration by 1955, but the process took much longer.\n\nIn 1940, after damage sustained in the 193rd air raid on Central London, HM Land Registry was evacuated to the Marsham Court Hotel in [[Bournemouth]] so that it could carry on its normal business. In 1950, eighty-eight years after its creation, HM Land Registry registered its one millionth title.\n\nThe growth in property ownership after the war years meant that the potential number of properties to be registered increased dramatically. This, in turn, slowed down the rate of land registration. To deal with the increasing workload, an office was opened in Tunbridge Wells in 1955 and a further office at Lytham St. Annes in 1957. In 1963, 101 years after the registry started, it registered its two millionth title.\n\nTheodore Ruoff, who was appointed Chief Land Registrar in 1963, laid down the three fundamental principles of Land Registration:\n\n* The Mirror principle \u2014 the register of title should reflect, accurately and completely, and beyond all argument, the facts that are material to the title\n* The Curtain principle \u2014 the register should be the sole and definitive source of information for proposing purchasers, but should not reveal sensitive information\n* The Insurance principle \u2014 if, as a result of human error, the title is proved to be defective in any way, then the person or persons suffering loss as a result, must be able to claim compensation\n\nNew offices were opened in Gloucester and Stevenage (1964), Durham and Harrow (1965), Plymouth (1966), Croydon and Swansea (1967), Birkenhead and Weymouth (1977), Peterborough (1978), Telford (1986), Coventry and Hull (1987), Leicester (1988), Portsmouth (1989), York (1991) and Lancashire (2000).\n\nLand registers at this time{{when|date=February 2018}} were not public records, and processing them required laborious typing and the completion of plans by hand using paintbrushes and ink on linen. Copies of everything produced had to be made by hand. HM Land Registry retained the originals, and the copies were sewn, using needle and thread, into large certificates. The certificates were produced as indisputable evidence of the ownership of the land. Such was the importance of the certificates that tampering with them was a criminal offence.\n\nIn 1986 the Plymouth Office became the first HM Land Registry office to produce registers electronically. Although the certificates still bore the same importance, computerisation dramatically increased the efficiency of the Land Register at a time when HM Land Registry was keen to bring the whole of England and Wales under compulsory registration.\n\nIn 1990 the provision of compulsory registration was brought to the whole of England and Wales, the ten millionth title was registered,  and for the first time, the Land Register was opened to public inspection.\n\nAlthough compulsory registration had now spread to the whole of its jurisdiction, compulsion only occurred when a property was sold. This was a barrier to the registration of the whole of England and Wales, and in 1998 new triggers for registration were introduced, dramatically increasing the rate of registration of land. These triggers included gifts of land, assent of land on death and raising monies by mortgages on the land.\n\nThe [[Land Registration Act 2002]] leaves the system substantially in place, but enables the future compulsory introduction of electronic conveyancing, using electronic signatures to transfer and register property.  As a result of that act, Land and Charge Certificates are no longer issued.\n\nThe new home of the Information Systems department, a state-of-the-art office with 500 staff, was opened in 2005 in Plymouth's International Business Park.\n\n==Chief Land Registrars==\n* [[Brent Spencer Follett]] (1862\u20131886)\n* Robert Hallet Holt (1886\u20131900)\n* [[Charles Brickdale|Sir Charles Fortescue Brickdale]] (1900\u20131923)\n* Sir John Stewart Stewart-Wallace (1923\u20131941)\n* Rouxville Mark Lowe (1941\u20131947)\n* Sir George Harold Curtis (1947\u20131963)\n* Theodore Burton Fox Ruoff (1963\u20131974)\n* Robert Burnell Roper (1974\u20131983)\n* Eric John Pryer (1983\u20131990)\n* John Manthorpe (1990\u20131996)\n* Stuart John Hill (1996\u20131999)\n* Peter Collis (1999\u20132010)\n* Marco Pierleoni (2010\u20132011)\n* Malcolm Dawson (2011\u20132013)\n* Ed Lester (2013\u20132015)\n* Graham Farrant (2015-2018)\n* Mike Harlow (Acting) (2018-2019)\n* Simon Hayes (2019-)\n\n==Privatisation plans==\nOn 23 January 2014, the Government issued a public consultation on its proposal to create a service delivery company to carry out the day-to-day process of land registration.

It is one of the largest property databases in Europe. At the peak of the property boom in 2007, \u00a31 million worth of property was processed every minute in England and Wales.<ref>Collis, Peter (April 2006) [https://web.archive.org/web/20070602044143/http://www.landregistry.gov.uk/strategy/10yearplan/ Welcome to Land Registry\u2019s 10-year strategic plan]. landregistry.gov.uk</ref>\n\nLike [[land registration]] organisations in other countries, HM Land Registry guarantees [[Title (property)|title]] to registered estates and interests in land. It records the ownership rights of [[Freehold (English law)|freehold]] properties, and [[leasehold]] properties where the lease has been granted for a term exceeding seven years.\n\nThe definition of land can include the buildings situated upon the land, particularly where parts of buildings at different levels (such as flats) are in different ownership. It is also possible to register the ownership of the mines and minerals which lie within the ground, as well as airspace above property where this is in separate ownership.\n\nHM Land Registry receives no government funding, being required to ensure that its income covers expenditure, and finances itself from registration and search fees. It provides online access to its database of ''titles'' (ownership and ''charges'' or interests by other parties) and most ''plans'' (maps). People need to pay a fee to access some information.\n\nProperty owners whose property is not registered can make voluntary applications for registration. As of March 2016, there are 24.5 million registered titles representing 88%<ref>[https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/land-registry-annual-report-and-accounts-2015-to-2016/annual-report-and-accounts-2015-to-2016 HM Land Registry Annual Report 2015-2016]</ref> of the land mass of England and Wales. Registration of land under the [[Land Registration Act 2002]] affords property owners some protection against squatters as well as avoiding the need to produce old documents each time a property changes hands.\n\n==Benefits of land registration==\nAccording to HM Land Registry:<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.landregistry.gov.uk/register-land/voluntary-registration-a-guide-for-solicitors-and-property-professionals|archive-url=http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20140709064818/http://www.landregistry.gov.uk/register-land/voluntary-registration-a-guide-for-solicitors-and-property-professionals|url-status=dead|archive-date=2014-07-09|title=[ARCHIVED CONTENT] UK Government Web Archive \u2013 The National Archives|last=Foundation|first=Internet Memory|website=webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk|access-date=2017-02-13}}</ref>\n\n{{cquote\n|Registration establishes proof of ownership and produces an easy-to-read document reflecting the contents of all the paper title deeds.

The register can be viewed quickly and securely online.\n\nThere is no better way to safeguard ownership of land and property than by registering your title with us. State-backed registration gives you greater security of title, providing you with better protection against claims of adverse possession}}\n\nRegistering a title provides a \"Title Plan\" which is normally not definitive, but which identifies the land within the title on the Ordnance Survey map. It is important that the original title deeds are retained as they will provide a starting point if ever it is necessary to identify the precise position of the boundaries.{{citation needed|date=May 2016}}\n\nIn addition to being the government body that registers the ownership of land and property in England and Wales, HM Land Registry is also a useful tool for property investors who use the online price calculator to query the latest monthly residential property prices.

This involved merging offices in Birkenhead, Durham, Lytham/Warton, Nottingham and Swansea, and closing of offices in [[London Borough of Harrow|Harrow]] and [[York]].\n\nA further review of staffing levels and overall office space began in 2009. The economic recession and lower volumes of property sales and mortgages meant that HM Land Registry's basic work in connection with remortgages and house sales reduced to the point where it made a financial loss for the first time in many years.

From July 2013, the functions of the Adjudicator have been transferred to the Land Registration division of the Property Chamber of the [[First-tier Tribunal]].\n\n==History==\n[[File:HM Land Registry entrance.jpg|thumb|Former Land Registry Head Office, [[32 Lincoln's Inn Fields]] (1913\u20132011)]]\nIn 1857 the Royal Commission on Registration of Title proposed a system of registration administered by a central registry in London with district offices. The [[Land Registry Act 1862]] was introduced by the then [[Lord Chancellor]], [[Richard Bethell, 1st Baron Westbury]]. The Act provided for the registration of [[freehold (English law)|freehold]] and long [[leasehold]] estates in land. The system of registration adopted had some differences to that piloted in [[South Australia]] by that colony's then Premier Sir [[Robert Richard Torrens|Robert Torrens]], although both were founded on the 1857 report.\n\n[[Brent Spencer Follett]], the first Chief Land Registrar, opened the Land Registry's first offices, at 34 Lincoln's Inn Fields, London, on 15 October 1862. Mr Follett had a staff of just six people and was paid \u00a32,500 a year, at a time when the average labourer's wage was \u00a340.<ref>British Labour Statistics: Historical Abstracts, 1886\u20131968, quoted in [http://privatewww.essex.ac.uk/~alan/family/N-Money.html#DoEP Essex University research].  Retrieved 10 October 2011.</ref>\n\nAt first, registration was not compulsory, and once property was registered there was no compulsion to register any subsequent transactions. Thus it was possible for the person registered as the owner of a property to cease to be the owner while remaining on the register. Serious flaws in the 1862 Act led to the Land Transfer Act 1875, which forms the basis of the system used today. However, the LTA did not make registration compulsory.\n\nA report by Sir [[Charles Brickdale]] on the system of land registration used in Germany proved influential. In 1897 the then Lord Chancellor, [[Hardinge Giffard, 1st Earl of Halsbury]] introduced the Land Transfer Act 1897, which brought an element of compulsion into the registration system. To satisfy the demands of the legal profession, the option of a county veto was offered.\n\nLondon County Council was attracted to the idea of compulsory registration and voted in favour of it. It was introduced in stages between 1899 and 1902 and this led to the expansion of HM Land Registry. Also at this time, the first female staff were employed and typewriters were introduced. A proposal to extend compulsory registration to Northamptonshire in 1902 was lost in committee.\n\nFrom 1905 to 1913 new HM Land Registry headquarters were built in Lincoln's Inn Fields.\n\nTwo significant pieces of land legislation were enacted in 1925: the Law of Property Act and the Land Registration Act. Government-initiated extensions to compulsory registration were suspended for ten years, but [[Eastbourne]] (1926) and [[Hastings]] (1929) voluntarily became areas of compulsory registration. After the ten years were up, compulsory registration was extended to [[Middlesex]] (1937) and the County Borough of [[Croydon]] (1939). Plans to extend it to Surrey in 1940 were abandoned due to the [[Second World War]]. In 1925 the government forecast that the whole of England and Wales would be subject to compulsory registration by 1955, but the process took much longer.\n\nIn 1940, after damage sustained in the 193rd air raid on Central London, HM Land Registry was evacuated to the Marsham Court Hotel in [[Bournemouth]] so that it could carry on its normal business. In 1950, eighty-eight years after its creation, HM Land Registry registered its one millionth title.\n\nThe growth in property ownership after the war years meant that the potential number of properties to be registered increased dramatically. This, in turn, slowed down the rate of land registration. To deal with the increasing workload, an office was opened in Tunbridge Wells in 1955 and a further office at Lytham St. Annes in 1957. In 1963, 101 years after the registry started, it registered its two millionth title.\n\nTheodore Ruoff, who was appointed Chief Land Registrar in 1963, laid down the three fundamental principles of Land Registration:\n\n* The Mirror principle \u2014 the register of title should reflect, accurately and completely, and beyond all argument, the facts that are material to the title\n* The Curtain principle \u2014 the register should be the sole and definitive source of information for proposing purchasers, but should not reveal sensitive information\n* The Insurance principle \u2014 if, as a result of human error, the title is proved to be defective in any way, then the person or persons suffering loss as a result, must be able to claim compensation\n\nNew offices were opened in Gloucester and Stevenage (1964), Durham and Harrow (1965), Plymouth (1966), Croydon and Swansea (1967), Birkenhead and Weymouth (1977), Peterborough (1978), Telford (1986), Coventry and Hull (1987), Leicester (1988), Portsmouth (1989), York (1991) and Lancashire (2000).\n\nLand registers at this time{{when|date=February 2018}} were not public records, and processing them required laborious typing and the completion of plans by hand using paintbrushes and ink on linen. Copies of everything produced had to be made by hand. HM Land Registry retained the originals, and the copies were sewn, using needle and thread, into large certificates. The certificates were produced as indisputable evidence of the ownership of the land. Such was the importance of the certificates that tampering with them was a criminal offence.\n\nIn 1986 the Plymouth Office became the first HM Land Registry office to produce registers electronically. Although the certificates still bore the same importance, computerisation dramatically increased the efficiency of the Land Register at a time when HM Land Registry was keen to bring the whole of England and Wales under compulsory registration.\n\nIn 1990 the provision of compulsory registration was brought to the whole of England and Wales, the ten millionth title was registered,  and for the first time, the Land Register was opened to public inspection.\n\nAlthough compulsory registration had now spread to the whole of its jurisdiction, compulsion only occurred when a property was sold. This was a barrier to the registration of the whole of England and Wales, and in 1998 new triggers for registration were introduced, dramatically increasing the rate of registration of land. These triggers included gifts of land, assent of land on death and raising monies by mortgages on the land.\n\nThe [[Land Registration Act 2002]] leaves the system substantially in place, but enables the future compulsory introduction of electronic conveyancing, using electronic signatures to transfer and register property.  As a result of that act, Land and Charge Certificates are no longer issued.\n\nThe new home of the Information Systems department, a state-of-the-art office with 500 staff, was opened in 2005 in Plymouth's International Business Park.\n\n==Chief Land Registrars==\n* [[Brent Spencer Follett]] (1862\u20131886)\n* Robert Hallet Holt (1886\u20131900)\n* [[Charles Brickdale|Sir Charles Fortescue Brickdale]] (1900\u20131923)\n* Sir John Stewart Stewart-Wallace (1923\u20131941)\n* Rouxville Mark Lowe (1941\u20131947)\n* Sir George Harold Curtis (1947\u20131963)\n* Theodore Burton Fox Ruoff (1963\u20131974)\n* Robert Burnell Roper (1974\u20131983)\n* Eric John Pryer (1983\u20131990)\n* John Manthorpe (1990\u20131996)\n* Stuart John Hill (1996\u20131999)\n* Peter Collis (1999\u20132010)\n* Marco Pierleoni (2010\u20132011)\n* Malcolm Dawson (2011\u20132013)\n* Ed Lester (2013\u20132015)\n* Graham Farrant (2015-2018)\n* Mike Harlow (Acting) (2018-2019)\n* Simon Hayes (2019-)\n\n==Privatisation plans==\nOn 23 January 2014, the Government issued a public consultation on its proposal to create a service delivery company to carry out the day-to-day process of land registration.

Debuting on the [[YTV (TV channel)|YTV]] network in [[Canada]] on September 29, 2006, the series was also broadcast on Discovery Kids/The Hub (now [[Discovery Family]]) in the [[United States]] on January 13, 2007. It also aired on [[Jetix]] on June 2, 2007 and [[Pop Max]] from September 15, 2008 in the [[United Kingdom]], and on [[ABC Television|ABC]] in [[Australia]] in December 2007. The original run ended on June 26, 2009, but some episodes were left unaired. It formerly aired reruns on [[Qubo]] from March 28, 2016 to December 28, 2019.\n\n==Premise==\nTy and Abby are a teenage brother-and-sister crime-fighting team who report to the Bureau of Grossology, a secret government agency whose job is to investigate gross criminals, their gross crimes, and/or various gross phenomena AND DO PORN.<ref>Ytv.com</ref> Each episode of the series follows the pair on adventures based on real scientific facts. Aided by their friend Lab Rat (a human scientist), their boss The Director, and their police liaison, The Detective, Ty and Abby work to keep the city safe, all while keeping their identities hidden.\n\n==Characters==\n===Main===\n* Tyler \"Ty\" Archer (voiced by [[Michael Cohen (actor)|Michael Cohen]]) \u2013 Ty is Abby's younger brother and a hard kid to face. He is very intelligent, possessing a cool, active and analytical that takes everything in. He sees himself as a scientist and takes his job as a grossologist very seriously. His goal is to be remembered among the very best within the scientific community. He even owns a chemistry set and does analyses on things he finds (e.g. Hairball's hairballs). He and Lab Rat share many common interests. On the field, Ty pilots the GRS-1 and is great at strategic maneuvers. His quick thinking has saved the day many times. In fact, he is hinted to be the most intelligent of the team, being smarter than Abby and even than Lab Rat. He has a crush on Naomi, who eventually becomes his girlfriend later in the series.\n* Abigail \"Abby\" Archer (voiced by [[Krystal Meadows]]) \u2013 Abby unravels mysteries so disgusting that no adult will touch them. She is very intelligent and loves everything gross and slimy. She likes to test her limits to see if there is something that can make even her, the Queen of Squeam, turn green. So far nothing has come close, although she closely resisted gagging on a few occasions. The only exception was when she unknowingly drank contaminated water and threw up. Despite all of this, she is terribly afraid of leeches. She gets covered in slop the most, and being dirty has yet to affect her trademark ponytail. On the field, she is a competent fighter. She holds a severe grudge against not only villains like Lance Boil, but her school rival Paige. Unlike her younger brother Ty, she is athletic and participates in school sports like volleyball. Abby depends on her instincts and feelings at times, which occasionally clouds her judgment. She shares ownership of her beloved pet kitten, Hairball, with Ty.\n* Paul \"Lab Rat\" Squirfenherder (voiced by [[Deven Mack|M. Christian Heywood]]) \u2013 Lab Rat is a former delinquent and now the Bureau of Grossology's tech support, who creates all sorts of gadgets to aid Ty and Abby on their missions. His quite impressive inventory of hi-tech gadgets and various scientific knowledge make him invaluable to the team. Lab Rat suffers from [[agoraphobia]], which prevents him from leaving the Gag Lab unless absolutely necessary, but instead spent his time doing lab work. This is what earned him the nickname \"Lab Rat,\" which he prefers to his real name. He has a pet rat named Hermes, who he treats as his best friend. He lacks in social skills. He also has a poor personal hygiene, Abby often jokes that he stinks due to the fact that bathing is not one of his favorite activities.\n* The Director (voiced by [[Paul O'Sullivan (actor)|Paul O'Sullivan]]) \u2013 The Director is the head of the Bureau of Grossology and gives the Grossologists their repulsive assignments, often in a state of panic. He is incredibly squeamish and terrified by the slightest hint of anything gross. In spite of this, he is known to arrogantly enter the scene after the crime is solved and take all the credit, claiming that Abby and Ty's success is because of his \"great leadership skills\". Abby and Ty see right through his farce and make sure his ego is kept in check, which isn't hard to do since the crime scenes often unnerve the Director anyway. He has on one known occasion gone into the field by himself to search for his missing agents.<ref>Episode 13, \"Kid Rot\"</ref>\n\n===Villains===\n* Insectiva (voiced by [[Lili Francks]]) \u2013 She was once a promising young university student who wanted to study [[entomology]] (the study of insects) until she discovered how insects are treated by science: captured and dissected. Now, armed with all sorts of bugs, she pursues an insect agenda, to wipe all people off the planet so bugs can rule again. She, like many insects, can't get past windows, therefore she is continuously running into them. She began a romantic relationship with Sloppy Joe in the Valentine's Day episode \"Pucker Up\". She also has a twin sister, Arachnidia, who is also her rival.\n** Real Name: Cara Chitin\n** First Appearance: Episode 1 (\"Queen for a Day\")\n** Cara Chitin's last name is based on [[chitin]], what insects' exoskeletons are made of.\n* The Slim Slime Man (voiced by [[Neil Crone]]) \u2013 A bitter old sewer worker, who abnormally fused with a living slime mould while working in the sewers one day, becoming a strange giant slime creature with a ghoulish skull-like head seen inside. As he gets more powerful, he aims to cover the surface world with living slime molds.\n** Real Name: Slim\n** First Appearance: Episode 2 (\"The Slim Slime Man\")\n* Fartor (voiced by [[Sean Cullen]]) \u2013 Fifteen years ago, he was just an ordinary kid, until his older brother Gary tortured him by stuffing him under the bed sheets and farting in there. During those fifteen years, his lungs adapted to the gases in farts. Like a fish out of water, clean air is poison to him, so he breathes toxic gases in a dome that he wears on his body. There was only one thing Fartor wanted... revenge on his brother.\n** Real Name: Larry\n** First Appearance: Episode 3 (\"Fartzilla\")\n* Sloppy Joe (voiced by [[George Buza]]) \u2013 After discovering that a whiff of his stink was enough to render people unconscious, Joe vowed to never let a drop of water, soap, or deodorant touch his skin again, and turned to an easy life of crime. His plan: go from filthy, to filthy rich. When clean he is shown to be an [[albino]]. Insectiva is his girlfriend as of the Valentine's Day episode \"Pucker Up\".\n** First Appearance: Episode 4 (\"The Perfect Stink\")\n** Real Name: Joseph Puglowski\n* The Scab Fairy (voiced by [[Jessica Holmes]]) \u2013 A crazed former beauty queen who was traumatized over a small cut to her shoulder, ending her career. Not seen since then, she used her exceptional degree in dermatology and mythology to create a high-tech dragonfly-winged suit made of scabs, and takes the identity of the Scab Fairy, based on a [[Tooth Fairy]]-like myth figure that collects scabs (rather than teeth). She is armed with a high-tech wand that removes scabs from people's wounds, and inflicts them on others. Her ultimate obsession is to inflict scabs on anyone pretty, as revenge for the loss of her old beauty queen career.\n** Real Name: Helena Globin\n** First Appearance: Episode 5 (\"The Scab Fairy\")\n** Helena Globin's name is a pun on the word [[hemoglobin]], a protein found in [[red blood cells]].\n* Lance Boil (voiced by [[Juan Chioran]]) \u2013 He was once a successful Grossologist; however, he envied The Director's authority. Boyle tried to pull a coup, using a \"prototype shrink-ray.\" Ty had tinkered with the weapon though, and Lance ended up blasting himself and shrinking in a somewhat lopsided manner (small body; large, misshapen, pus-filled head). Although horrified at first, Lance comes to be very proud of his boil.  Banished from the team, he decided to use his skills for evil, with one goal in his twisted head revenge against all Grossologists, especially Abby and Ty.\n** Real Name: Lance Boyle\n** First Appearance: Episode 6 (\"When Ya Gotta Go\")\n** His name references the medical term \"[[Incision and drainage|lancing a boil]]\".\n* Hagfish \u2013 \n** First Appearance: Episode 8 (\"Go Fish\")\n* Keith Van Kobbler (voiced by [[Pat Mastroianni]]) \u2013 A popular and undefeated young basketball player, and Abby's former idol. Calls himself \"VK\" for short, and [[Illeism|always refers to himself in the third person.]] Endorsed the \"KVK-1\" brand super-sneakers, which have been a runaway success, but after a short while, all wearers (including VK's opposing players, up-and-coming basketball players) suffer a severe case of foot fungus! After painstakingly examining the KVK-1 sneakers in the case, Ty and Lab Rat suspect VK himself to be the culprit, while Abby has difficulty accepting their suspicion. As it turns out, VK is ''indeed'' the culprit, with a twisted method behind his fame; he single-handedly manufactured the KVK-1 sneakers for mass consumption, and spiked them with fungus (while wearing a non-spiked \"Deluxe Edition\" pair for himself, of course), so that everyone will have foot fungus, and most of all, eliminate the competition, so that he will be the ''only'' basketball player in the world. His weapon is a high-tech \"Wrecking Ball\" basketball.\n** First Appearance: Episode 9 (\"It's Gotta Be the Shoes\")\n* Mr. Fowler (voiced by [[Derek McGrath]]) \u2013 He is the custodian at Ringworm Junior High School. He is small, timid, shy, afraid of Paige, and wears oversized glasses. Always hums the song \"4 and 20 Black Birds Baked In a Pie.\" He grew tired of cleaning up the excess pigeon poop around the school, so he built a giant mechanical owl suit, with which he captures pigeons and plots to put them in a pie to bake them.\n** First Appearance: Episode 10 (\"Owl Most Foul\")\n* Kid Rot (voiced by Travis Ferris) \u2013 After a science experiment mishap while trying to find a cure for foods going bad or rotting, young boy Chester gains the \"rotting touch,\" with which he causes all organic materials to rot with a single touch, and also gives off a horrible smell. He becomes a new student at Ringworm Junior High School, and causes chaos upon his arrival, with a concerned Abby and Ty trying to cure him (Abby initially had feelings for him, much to Ty's suspicion). But Chester's rotting powers literally go to his head, giving him a twisted personality (even christening himself \"Kid Rot\"), and making him a formidable and diabolical foe for the Grossology team. Worse, he has a psychotic infatuation for Abby (who ultimately hates him, at least his prevalent Kid Rot persona), and will stop at nothing to win her heart, even going as far as to rot the entire world! His rotting powers used to be an excellent fertilizer (in a way making his science experiment a success), but the second time they met, his rotting powers had evolved to where they just kill whatever they touch. The last time we saw Kid Rot, he was engulfed in rot he had created. Abby and Ty gave up looking for him but as the episode is about to end we see a hand (presumable Kid Rot's) sticking out from the rot and as a leaf lands on it, it's grabbed by the hand. The episode ends as we hear some heavy breathing. We have yet to know what has become of Chester/Kid Rot.\n** Real Name: Chester\n** First Appearance: Episode 13 (\"Kid Rot\")\n* Patrick (voiced by [[Julie Lemieux]]) \u2013 \n** First Appearance: Episode 17 (\"Survival of the Grossest\")\n* Dr. Cornelius Colon (voiced by [[Peter Keleghan]]) \u2013 A mad proctologist, who plots to engulf the world in a gigantic colon, starting with Ringworm Junior High School (on the last day before its Summer vacation), to take revenge on people for unsympathetically making fun of him for his unfortunate surname. Has giant tapeworms as henchmen.\n** First Appearance: Episode 18 (\"School's Grossed Out for Summer\")\n* Far-Ty \u2013 Ty as a temporary villain. Feeling he's not needed after Abby showed him up several times, Ty, trying to overcompensate for himself behind her back, was captured by Fartor, who was in the midst of planning yet another full-scale fart attack on the world. He exposes Ty to the same deadly gases that transformed him, using a special process to speed up the transformation. Now, Ty, as Far-Ty, becomes Fartor's greatest asset in carrying out his dastardly plan. And just as Fartor plotted revenge on his older brother Gary, Far-Ty carried out a twisted revenge on his older sister Abby.\n** Real Name: Ty Archer\n** First Appearance: Episode 20 (\"Silent But Deadly, Part 1\")\n* Frankenbooger \u2013 A giant monster made of nose [[mucus]] stolen by Sloppy Joe (using a suction gun), who simply wanted to make a \"boogerman\" with said mucus (much like a [[snowman]]). Abby and Ty confront Sloppy Joe, and in the process, inadvertently cause an electrical accident that brings the \"boogerman\" to life. The monster sucks mucus out of people's noses, and the more he consumes, the larger he gets. Its only weakness is dirt particles (just like any mucus), which cause him to not only dry up, but decrease in size.\n** First Appearance: Episode 24 (\"Frankenbooger\")\n* Darko Crevasse (voiced by [[Julian Richings]]) \u2013 A gothic caped villain whose eyesight is accustomed to darkness, and therefore must wear dark glasses. He summons a huge flock of bats to drop guano on anyone who opposes him. As he cannot stand light, his ultimate plan is to plunge the city into eternal darkness. In the Halloween episode \"Night of the Living Roadkill\", Paige commented that he was [[Goth subculture|Goth]].\n** First Appearance: Episode 23 (\"Lights Out\")\n* Sarah Senia (voiced by [[Jayne Eastwood]]) \u2013 A lady whose DNA structure was crossed with that of plants. Has leaves and tendrils around her body. Plotted to use giant carnivorous plants to attack the city, and ultimately, the world.\n** First Appearance: Episode 25 (\"A New Leaf\")\n* Arachnidia (voiced by [[Maria Vacratsis]]) \u2013 Insectiva's twin sister. Unlike Insectiva, she loves [[arachnids]], as her name suggests. She and Insectiva have had a bitter rivalry, and both pit their own respective arthropods against each other, with catastrophic results. She is the gothic version of Insectiva and her hairstyle is a big double-knob ponytail.\n** First Appearance: Episode 27 (\"Sinister Rivalry\")\n* Frederick Follicle (voiced by [[Stephen Ouimette]]) \u2013 A hair dresser who doesn't like to change styles. After getting kicked out of a job, he went underground doing biological experiments, and ended up with living hair.\n** First Appearance: Episode 31 (\"Hairless Whispers\")\n* Roger Pink-Eye (voiced by Lyon Smith) \u2013 A kid with a [[pink eye]]. He is curious about Ty and Abby's extra-curricular activities, and thus sets off to find the truth about his classmates' secret identities, using various attempts to do so, but all of them end in failure. In the second season trilogy (Pinkeye and The Brain, Pinkeye's Revenge Part 1, Pinkeye's Revenge Part 2), he teams up with Lance Boil (after successfully capturing him) to find out Ty and Abby's secret. He eventually becomes a Grossologist, but he is fired/quits after his plan backfires with Lance betraying him.\n** First Appearance: Episode 33 (\"Mold Monster\")\n* Basso Profondo (voiced by [[Ben Campbell (voice actor)|Ben Campbell]]) \u2013 A disgraced [[opera]] star, who was once part of the Three Baritones. He's back for revenge, but this time he's singing a whole new tune; in other words, he's now a [[burping]] star.\n** First Appearance: Episode 39 (\"Ain't Over Till the Fat Man Sings\")\n* Gary Gumdrop (voiced by [[Adrian Truss]]) \u2013 People call him the ultimate candy man, but he's just a crazy man with a big sweet tooth and a lot of rotten teeth. His plan is to make super tooth-rotting candy, pretending that they'll take care of your teeth, and distribute them to everyone, so he won't be the only one with a rotten mouth and a large craving for candy.\n** First Appearance: Episode 40 (\"Candy Isn't Dandy\")\n*Gundy McGoober (voiced by Bruce Pirrie) \u2013 Tired of campers bringing their new electronic devices with them, Gundy uses mutated worms to scare away people from his lake. \n** First Appearance: Episode  42 (\"Squirm\")\n* Evil Clone Abby (voiced by [[Krystal Meadows]]) \u2013 She is the creation of Roger Pink-Eye and Lance Boil, used as part of a  scheme to get Abby fired so that they can take over the Bureau of Grossology. She is made from a combination of human DNA and rat DNA. She attacked the city with an army of rats, and later infiltrated the Gag Lab and fired Ty and Lab Rat.\n** First Appearance: Episode 46 (\"Pink-Eye's Revenge (Part I)\")\n* Slitherbuddies \u2013 Genetically modified reptiles that start out cuddly but grow to be monstrous and vicious.\n** First Appearance: Episode 48 (\"Fang's A Lot\")\n\n===Supporting===\n* Harvey & Petunia Archer (voiced by Richard Binsley and [[Karen Hines]], respectively) \u2013 Abby and Ty's father and mother, respectively. Both are shown to be gullible, and as such, are completely unaware of their children's secret jobs as Grossologists. Harvey manages the city's water treatment plant while Petunia teaches [[entomology]]. Petunia has a fear of heights as shown in the episode \"Squirmed\".\n* The Detective (voiced by [[Danny Wells]]) \u2013 A gruff, burly police detective, who occasionally works with Abby and Ty on cases, and is the only outsider who knows their secret. He bears more than a strong resemblance to Detective Dick Gumshoe from the Phoenix Wright series of games.\n* Mr. Scheffer (voiced by Chad DeRohgth) \u2013 An often nervous and uptight teacher at Ringworm Junior High School. He has been noted to teach science (Silent But Deadly: Part 1) and direct plays (When Ya Gotta Go).\n* Paige Logan (voiced by [[Melissa Altro]]) \u2013 A popular but very snobbish girl at Ringworm Junior High, and Abby's bitter rival. However, as seen in \"New Recruits\", she was once actually nice to her. Her father is very rich, and her favorite color is pink. She has been noted several times throughout the second season to have a crush on a blond boy named Rudy.\n* Naomi (voiced by [[Lauren Collins]]) \u2013 A shy and gentle girl at Ringworm Junior High, and Ty's love interest. She takes [[ballet]]. She also has three incredibly jockish brothers, as seen in the episode \"When Allergies Attack\" when Ty went on a family picnic with her. It was also noticed in the previously mentioned episode that she has a long list of allergies.\n*Emily (voiced by [[Leah Pinsent]]) - a gothic nurse who is an expert on [[leech]]es.\n\n==Production==\n* Back when the series was in development in 2004, the planned series was somewhat different. Background designer Brad Graham was originally slated to do the character designs and backgrounds. The character designs looked completely different, and had more of a conventional \"abstract\" look like most modern kids' cartoons, but many of Graham's elements remained in the final version. The more diverse Grossology team lineup consisted of Abby and Ty (who were still the main characters, only Abby had pigtails rather than the long trademark ponytail), Nigel Stodding (a British kid fashioned like 1960s secret agent [[Harry Palmer]]), Lab Rat (who was an overweight Caucasian boy, but still had Hermes, who looked somewhat identical to the final version), and a weirder assortment of kids including Pink Eye (a beatnik boy; the basis for the villain Roger Pink-Eye), Creepy Crawly (a goth girl with spiders, who may have been the basis for the adult villainess Insectiva.), Sloppy Joe (a dirty spud-shaped kid, who ultimately became an adult villain for the series) and Colin Polyp (A bulb-headed kid who may have evolved into the adult villain Dr. Cornelius Colon in the final series). Abby and Ty still went to Ringworm Junior High School (which looked like a more classic-style school than the more modern one in the series), and the Gag Lab was originally a more complex underground secret base called the Grossotorium. Abby and Ty did not wear Slime Suits at this point.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://brad-graham.blogspot.com/2007/11/grossology-development.html|title=The Grahams: Grossology Development|author=Bradford I. Graham|work=brad-graham.blogspot.com|accessdate=March 28, 2015}}</ref>\n* According to [[M. Christian Heywood]], the voice of Lab Rat, upon discovering the original Lab Rat design, his initial audition for the character was a modified impression of [[Otacon]] from [[Metal Gear Solid (1998 video game)|Metal Gear Solid]].<ref>https://twitter.com/DevenOClock/status/1157075131216384001</ref> However, the director insisted for him to try the audition more close to his natural voice albeit with some [[Chris Tucker]] influence; in which he complied.

Debuting on the [[YTV (TV channel)|YTV]] network in [[Canada]] on September 29, 2006, the series was also broadcast on Discovery Kids/The Hub (now [[Discovery Family]]) in the [[United States]] on January 13, 2007. It also aired on [[Jetix]] on June 2, 2007 and [[Pop Max]] from September 15, 2008 in the [[United Kingdom]], and on [[ABC Television|ABC]] in [[Australia]] in December 2007. The original run ended on June 26, 2009, but some episodes were left unaired. It formerly aired reruns on [[Qubo]] from March 28, 2016 to December 28, 2019.\n\n==Premise==\nTy and Abby are a teenage brother-and-sister crime-fighting team who report to the Bureau of Grossology, a secret government agency whose job is to investigate gross criminals, their gross crimes, and/or various gross phenomena.<ref>Ytv.com</ref> Each episode of the series follows the pair on adventures based on real scientific facts. Aided by their friend Lab Rat (a human scientist), their boss The Director, and their police liaison, The Detective, Ty and Abby work to keep the city safe, all while keeping their identities hidden.\n\n==Characters==\n===Main===\n* Tyler \"Ty\" Archer (voiced by [[Michael Cohen (actor)|Michael Cohen]]) \u2013 Ty is Abby's younger brother and a hard kid to face. He is very intelligent, possessing a cool, active and analytical that takes everything in. He sees himself as a scientist and takes his job as a grossologist very seriously. His goal is to be remembered among the very best within the scientific community. He even owns a chemistry set and does analyses on things he finds (e.g. Hairball's hairballs). He and Lab Rat share many common interests. On the field, Ty pilots the GRS-1 and is great at strategic maneuvers. His quick thinking has saved the day many times. In fact, he is hinted to be the most intelligent of the team, being smarter than Abby and even than Lab Rat. He has a crush on Naomi, who eventually becomes his girlfriend later in the series.\n* Abigail \"Abby\" Archer (voiced by [[Krystal Meadows]]) \u2013 Abby unravels mysteries so disgusting that no adult will touch them. She is very intelligent and loves everything gross and slimy. She likes to test her limits to see if there is something that can make even her, the Queen of Squeam, turn green. So far nothing has come close, although she closely resisted gagging on a few occasions. The only exception was when she unknowingly drank contaminated water and threw up. Despite all of this, she is terribly afraid of leeches. She gets covered in slop the most, and being dirty has yet to affect her trademark ponytail. On the field, she is a competent fighter. She holds a severe grudge against not only villains like Lance Boil, but her school rival Paige. Unlike her younger brother Ty, she is athletic and participates in school sports like volleyball. Abby depends on her instincts and feelings at times, which occasionally clouds her judgment. She shares ownership of her beloved pet kitten, Hairball, with Ty.\n* Paul \"Lab Rat\" Squirfenherder (voiced by [[Deven Mack|M. Christian Heywood]]) \u2013 Lab Rat is a former delinquent and now the Bureau of Grossology's tech support, who creates all sorts of gadgets to aid Ty and Abby on their missions. His quite impressive inventory of hi-tech gadgets and various scientific knowledge make him invaluable to the team. Lab Rat suffers from [[agoraphobia]], which prevents him from leaving the Gag Lab unless absolutely necessary, but instead spent his time doing lab work. This is what earned him the nickname \"Lab Rat,\" which he prefers to his real name. He has a pet rat named Hermes, who he treats as his best friend. He lacks in social skills. He also has a poor personal hygiene, Abby often jokes that he stinks due to the fact that bathing is not one of his favorite activities.\n* The Director (voiced by [[Paul O'Sullivan (actor)|Paul O'Sullivan]]) \u2013 The Director is the head of the Bureau of Grossology and gives the Grossologists their repulsive assignments, often in a state of panic. He is incredibly squeamish and terrified by the slightest hint of anything gross. In spite of this, he is known to arrogantly enter the scene after the crime is solved and take all the credit, claiming that Abby and Ty's success is because of his \"great leadership skills\". Abby and Ty see right through his farce and make sure his ego is kept in check, which isn't hard to do since the crime scenes often unnerve the Director anyway. He has on one known occasion gone into the field by himself to search for his missing agents.<ref>Episode 13, \"Kid Rot\"</ref>\n\n===Villains===\n* Insectiva (voiced by [[Lili Francks]]) \u2013 She was once a promising young university student who wanted to study [[entomology]] (the study of insects) until she discovered how insects are treated by science: captured and dissected. Now, armed with all sorts of bugs, she pursues an insect agenda, to wipe all people off the planet so bugs can rule again. She, like many insects, can't get past windows, therefore she is continuously running into them. She began a romantic relationship with Sloppy Joe in the Valentine's Day episode \"Pucker Up\". She also has a twin sister, Arachnidia, who is also her rival.\n** Real Name: Cara Chitin\n** First Appearance: Episode 1 (\"Queen for a Day\")\n** Cara Chitin's last name is based on [[chitin]], what insects' exoskeletons are made of.\n* The Slim Slime Man (voiced by [[Neil Crone]]) \u2013 A bitter old sewer worker, who abnormally fused with a living slime mould while working in the sewers one day, becoming a strange giant slime creature with a ghoulish skull-like head seen inside. As he gets more powerful, he aims to cover the surface world with living slime molds.\n** Real Name: Slim\n** First Appearance: Episode 2 (\"The Slim Slime Man\")\n* Fartor (voiced by [[Sean Cullen]]) \u2013 Fifteen years ago, he was just an ordinary kid, until his older brother Gary tortured him by stuffing him under the bed sheets and farting in there. During those fifteen years, his lungs adapted to the gases in farts. Like a fish out of water, clean air is poison to him, so he breathes toxic gases in a dome that he wears on his body. There was only one thing Fartor wanted... revenge on his brother.\n** Real Name: Larry\n** First Appearance: Episode 3 (\"Fartzilla\")\n* Sloppy Joe (voiced by [[George Buza]]) \u2013 After discovering that a whiff of his stink was enough to render people unconscious, Joe vowed to never let a drop of water, soap, or deodorant touch his skin again, and turned to an easy life of crime. His plan: go from filthy, to filthy rich. When clean he is shown to be an [[albino]]. Insectiva is his girlfriend as of the Valentine's Day episode \"Pucker Up\".\n** First Appearance: Episode 4 (\"The Perfect Stink\")\n** Real Name: Joseph Puglowski\n* The Scab Fairy (voiced by [[Jessica Holmes]]) \u2013 A crazed former beauty queen who was traumatized over a small cut to her shoulder, ending her career. Not seen since then, she used her exceptional degree in dermatology and mythology to create a high-tech dragonfly-winged suit made of scabs, and takes the identity of the Scab Fairy, based on a [[Tooth Fairy]]-like myth figure that collects scabs (rather than teeth). She is armed with a high-tech wand that removes scabs from people's wounds, and inflicts them on others. Her ultimate obsession is to inflict scabs on anyone pretty, as revenge for the loss of her old beauty queen career.\n** Real Name: Helena Globin\n** First Appearance: Episode 5 (\"The Scab Fairy\")\n** Helena Globin's name is a pun on the word [[hemoglobin]], a protein found in [[red blood cells]].\n* Lance Boil (voiced by [[Juan Chioran]]) \u2013 He was once a successful Grossologist; however, he envied The Director's authority. Boyle tried to pull a coup, using a \"prototype shrink-ray.\" Ty had tinkered with the weapon though, and Lance ended up blasting himself and shrinking in a somewhat lopsided manner (small body; large, misshapen, pus-filled head). Although horrified at first, Lance comes to be very proud of his boil.  Banished from the team, he decided to use his skills for evil, with one goal in his twisted head revenge against all Grossologists, especially Abby and Ty.\n** Real Name: Lance Boyle\n** First Appearance: Episode 6 (\"When Ya Gotta Go\")\n** His name references the medical term \"[[Incision and drainage|lancing a boil]]\".\n* Hagfish \u2013 \n** First Appearance: Episode 8 (\"Go Fish\")\n* Keith Van Kobbler (voiced by [[Pat Mastroianni]]) \u2013 A popular and undefeated young basketball player, and Abby's former idol. Calls himself \"VK\" for short, and [[Illeism|always refers to himself in the third person.]] Endorsed the \"KVK-1\" brand super-sneakers, which have been a runaway success, but after a short while, all wearers (including VK's opposing players, up-and-coming basketball players) suffer a severe case of foot fungus! After painstakingly examining the KVK-1 sneakers in the case, Ty and Lab Rat suspect VK himself to be the culprit, while Abby has difficulty accepting their suspicion. As it turns out, VK is ''indeed'' the culprit, with a twisted method behind his fame; he single-handedly manufactured the KVK-1 sneakers for mass consumption, and spiked them with fungus (while wearing a non-spiked \"Deluxe Edition\" pair for himself, of course), so that everyone will have foot fungus, and most of all, eliminate the competition, so that he will be the ''only'' basketball player in the world. His weapon is a high-tech \"Wrecking Ball\" basketball.\n** First Appearance: Episode 9 (\"It's Gotta Be the Shoes\")\n* Mr. Fowler (voiced by [[Derek McGrath]]) \u2013 He is the custodian at Ringworm Junior High School. He is small, timid, shy, afraid of Paige, and wears oversized glasses. Always hums the song \"4 and 20 Black Birds Baked In a Pie.\" He grew tired of cleaning up the excess pigeon poop around the school, so he built a giant mechanical owl suit, with which he captures pigeons and plots to put them in a pie to bake them.\n** First Appearance: Episode 10 (\"Owl Most Foul\")\n* Kid Rot (voiced by Travis Ferris) \u2013 After a science experiment mishap while trying to find a cure for foods going bad or rotting, young boy Chester gains the \"rotting touch,\" with which he causes all organic materials to rot with a single touch, and also gives off a horrible smell. He becomes a new student at Ringworm Junior High School, and causes chaos upon his arrival, with a concerned Abby and Ty trying to cure him (Abby initially had feelings for him, much to Ty's suspicion). But Chester's rotting powers literally go to his head, giving him a twisted personality (even christening himself \"Kid Rot\"), and making him a formidable and diabolical foe for the Grossology team. Worse, he has a psychotic infatuation for Abby (who ultimately hates him, at least his prevalent Kid Rot persona), and will stop at nothing to win her heart, even going as far as to rot the entire world! His rotting powers used to be an excellent fertilizer (in a way making his science experiment a success), but the second time they met, his rotting powers had evolved to where they just kill whatever they touch. The last time we saw Kid Rot, he was engulfed in rot he had created. Abby and Ty gave up looking for him but as the episode is about to end we see a hand (presumable Kid Rot's) sticking out from the rot and as a leaf lands on it, it's grabbed by the hand. The episode ends as we hear some heavy breathing. We have yet to know what has become of Chester/Kid Rot.\n** Real Name: Chester\n** First Appearance: Episode 13 (\"Kid Rot\")\n* Patrick (voiced by [[Julie Lemieux]]) \u2013 \n** First Appearance: Episode 17 (\"Survival of the Grossest\")\n* Dr. Cornelius Colon (voiced by [[Peter Keleghan]]) \u2013 A mad proctologist, who plots to engulf the world in a gigantic colon, starting with Ringworm Junior High School (on the last day before its Summer vacation), to take revenge on people for unsympathetically making fun of him for his unfortunate surname. Has giant tapeworms as henchmen.\n** First Appearance: Episode 18 (\"School's Grossed Out for Summer\")\n* Far-Ty \u2013 Ty as a temporary villain. Feeling he's not needed after Abby showed him up several times, Ty, trying to overcompensate for himself behind her back, was captured by Fartor, who was in the midst of planning yet another full-scale fart attack on the world. He exposes Ty to the same deadly gases that transformed him, using a special process to speed up the transformation. Now, Ty, as Far-Ty, becomes Fartor's greatest asset in carrying out his dastardly plan. And just as Fartor plotted revenge on his older brother Gary, Far-Ty carried out a twisted revenge on his older sister Abby.\n** Real Name: Ty Archer\n** First Appearance: Episode 20 (\"Silent But Deadly, Part 1\")\n* Frankenbooger \u2013 A giant monster made of nose [[mucus]] stolen by Sloppy Joe (using a suction gun), who simply wanted to make a \"boogerman\" with said mucus (much like a [[snowman]]). Abby and Ty confront Sloppy Joe, and in the process, inadvertently cause an electrical accident that brings the \"boogerman\" to life. The monster sucks mucus out of people's noses, and the more he consumes, the larger he gets. Its only weakness is dirt particles (just like any mucus), which cause him to not only dry up, but decrease in size.\n** First Appearance: Episode 24 (\"Frankenbooger\")\n* Darko Crevasse (voiced by [[Julian Richings]]) \u2013 A gothic caped villain whose eyesight is accustomed to darkness, and therefore must wear dark glasses. He summons a huge flock of bats to drop guano on anyone who opposes him. As he cannot stand light, his ultimate plan is to plunge the city into eternal darkness. In the Halloween episode \"Night of the Living Roadkill\", Paige commented that he was [[Goth subculture|Goth]].\n** First Appearance: Episode 23 (\"Lights Out\")\n* Sarah Senia (voiced by [[Jayne Eastwood]]) \u2013 A lady whose DNA structure was crossed with that of plants. Has leaves and tendrils around her body. Plotted to use giant carnivorous plants to attack the city, and ultimately, the world.\n** First Appearance: Episode 25 (\"A New Leaf\")\n* Arachnidia (voiced by [[Maria Vacratsis]]) \u2013 Insectiva's twin sister. Unlike Insectiva, she loves [[arachnids]], as her name suggests. She and Insectiva have had a bitter rivalry, and both pit their own respective arthropods against each other, with catastrophic results. She is the gothic version of Insectiva and her hairstyle is a big double-knob ponytail.\n** First Appearance: Episode 27 (\"Sinister Rivalry\")\n* Frederick Follicle (voiced by [[Stephen Ouimette]]) \u2013 A hair dresser who doesn't like to change styles. After getting kicked out of a job, he went underground doing biological experiments, and ended up with living hair.\n** First Appearance: Episode 31 (\"Hairless Whispers\")\n* Roger Pink-Eye (voiced by Lyon Smith) \u2013 A kid with a [[pink eye]]. He is curious about Ty and Abby's extra-curricular activities, and thus sets off to find the truth about his classmates' secret identities, using various attempts to do so, but all of them end in failure. In the second season trilogy (Pinkeye and The Brain, Pinkeye's Revenge Part 1, Pinkeye's Revenge Part 2), he teams up with Lance Boil (after successfully capturing him) to find out Ty and Abby's secret. He eventually becomes a Grossologist, but he is fired/quits after his plan backfires with Lance betraying him.\n** First Appearance: Episode 33 (\"Mold Monster\")\n* Basso Profondo (voiced by [[Ben Campbell (voice actor)|Ben Campbell]]) \u2013 A disgraced [[opera]] star, who was once part of the Three Baritones. He's back for revenge, but this time he's singing a whole new tune; in other words, he's now a [[burping]] star.\n** First Appearance: Episode 39 (\"Ain't Over Till the Fat Man Sings\")\n* Gary Gumdrop (voiced by [[Adrian Truss]]) \u2013 People call him the ultimate candy man, but he's just a crazy man with a big sweet tooth and a lot of rotten teeth. His plan is to make super tooth-rotting candy, pretending that they'll take care of your teeth, and distribute them to everyone, so he won't be the only one with a rotten mouth and a large craving for candy.\n** First Appearance: Episode 40 (\"Candy Isn't Dandy\")\n*Gundy McGoober (voiced by Bruce Pirrie) \u2013 Tired of campers bringing their new electronic devices with them, Gundy uses mutated worms to scare away people from his lake. \n** First Appearance: Episode  42 (\"Squirm\")\n* Evil Clone Abby (voiced by [[Krystal Meadows]]) \u2013 She is the creation of Roger Pink-Eye and Lance Boil, used as part of a  scheme to get Abby fired so that they can take over the Bureau of Grossology. She is made from a combination of human DNA and rat DNA. She attacked the city with an army of rats, and later infiltrated the Gag Lab and fired Ty and Lab Rat.\n** First Appearance: Episode 46 (\"Pink-Eye's Revenge (Part I)\")\n* Slitherbuddies \u2013 Genetically modified reptiles that start out cuddly but grow to be monstrous and vicious.\n** First Appearance: Episode 48 (\"Fang's A Lot\")\n\n===Supporting===\n* Harvey & Petunia Archer (voiced by Richard Binsley and [[Karen Hines]], respectively) \u2013 Abby and Ty's father and mother, respectively. Both are shown to be gullible, and as such, are completely unaware of their children's secret jobs as Grossologists. Harvey manages the city's water treatment plant while Petunia teaches [[entomology]]. Petunia has a fear of heights as shown in the episode \"Squirmed\".\n* The Detective (voiced by [[Danny Wells]]) \u2013 A gruff, burly police detective, who occasionally works with Abby and Ty on cases, and is the only outsider who knows their secret. He bears more than a strong resemblance to Detective Dick Gumshoe from the Phoenix Wright series of games.\n* Mr. Scheffer (voiced by Chad DeRohgth) \u2013 An often nervous and uptight teacher at Ringworm Junior High School. He has been noted to teach science (Silent But Deadly: Part 1) and direct plays (When Ya Gotta Go).\n* Paige Logan (voiced by [[Melissa Altro]]) \u2013 A popular but very snobbish girl at Ringworm Junior High, and Abby's bitter rival. However, as seen in \"New Recruits\", she was once actually nice to her. Her father is very rich, and her favorite color is pink. She has been noted several times throughout the second season to have a crush on a blond boy named Rudy.\n* Naomi (voiced by [[Lauren Collins]]) \u2013 A shy and gentle girl at Ringworm Junior High, and Ty's love interest. She takes [[ballet]]. She also has three incredibly jockish brothers, as seen in the episode \"When Allergies Attack\" when Ty went on a family picnic with her. It was also noticed in the previously mentioned episode that she has a long list of allergies.\n*Emily (voiced by [[Leah Pinsent]]) - a gothic nurse who is an expert on [[leech]]es.\n\n==Production==\n* Back when the series was in development in 2004, the planned series was somewhat different. Background designer Brad Graham was originally slated to do the character designs and backgrounds. The character designs looked completely different, and had more of a conventional \"abstract\" look like most modern kids' cartoons, but many of Graham's elements remained in the final version. The more diverse Grossology team lineup consisted of Abby and Ty (who were still the main characters, only Abby had pigtails rather than the long trademark ponytail), Nigel Stodding (a British kid fashioned like 1960s secret agent [[Harry Palmer]]), Lab Rat (who was an overweight Caucasian boy, but still had Hermes, who looked somewhat identical to the final version), and a weirder assortment of kids including Pink Eye (a beatnik boy; the basis for the villain Roger Pink-Eye), Creepy Crawly (a goth girl with spiders, who may have been the basis for the adult villainess Insectiva.), Sloppy Joe (a dirty spud-shaped kid, who ultimately became an adult villain for the series) and Colin Polyp (A bulb-headed kid who may have evolved into the adult villain Dr. Cornelius Colon in the final series). Abby and Ty still went to Ringworm Junior High School (which looked like a more classic-style school than the more modern one in the series), and the Gag Lab was originally a more complex underground secret base called the Grossotorium. Abby and Ty did not wear Slime Suits at this point.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://brad-graham.blogspot.com/2007/11/grossology-development.html|title=The Grahams: Grossology Development|author=Bradford I.

Knowing nothing about the drug trade, he enlists the aid of his former student, [[#Jesse Pinkman|Jesse Pinkman]], to sell the meth he produces. Walt's scientific knowledge and dedication to quality lead him to produce crystal meth that is purer and more potent than any competitors'. To avoid the tedious collection of pseudoephedrine required for production, Walt devises an alternative chemical process utilizing [[methylamine]], giving his product a distinctive blue color. His crystal meth, which is given the street name \"Blue Sky,\" dominates the market, leading to confrontations with established drug makers and dealers.\n\nWalt is initially squeamish about the use of violence, but gradually comes to see it as a necessity. He also comes to find his new status as a [[drug lord]] psychologically rewarding, leading him to become less and less reluctant to resort to criminal acts such as [[theft]], [[extortion]], [[money laundering]], [[depraved indifference]], and [[murder]]. Walt's descent, [[Macbeth]]-like,<ref name=\"TOM GUALTIERI\">{{cite news|journal=Salon|date=August 10, 2013 |title=Walter White vs. Macbeth|first=Tom|last=Gualtieri|url=http://www.salon.com/2013/08/10/walter_white_vs_macbeth/}}</ref> into the criminal underworld unearths immense levels of deeply repressed ambition, rage, resentment, vanity, and an increasing ruthlessness which alienates him from his family and colleagues.\n\n====Skyler White====\n{{see also|Skyler White}}\n[[File:Anna Gunn by Gage Skidmore 2.jpg|thumb|upright=0.5|Anna Gunn]]\n'''Skyler White''' (n\u00e9e '''Lambert''') (played by [[Anna Gunn]]) is Walter's wife. She has had several meager sources of income: writing short stories, selling items on [[eBay]], working as a bookkeeper, and ultimately helping her husband launder money. Skyler and Walter have a son, Walter Jr., and an infant daughter, Holly. Skyler loves Walter very much, but their marriage becomes increasingly strained due to his unexplained absences and bizarre behavior, ultimately leading to their separation. Later, once Walter reveals his operation, she aids him in laundering his funds. They buy the car wash where Walter had recently moonlighted. Although she helps Walter, she remains displeased with the overall situation. As Walter slowly becomes more of a \"hardened criminal,\" her emotions of fear and worry for him become increasingly prevalent. When in the episode \"Buried,\" Hank tells Skyler he is on to Walt but needs her help to provide sufficient evidence to build a successful case, Skyler replies that she needs a lawyer and later tells Walt they should remain quiet.\n\n====Jesse Pinkman====\n{{see also|Jesse Pinkman}}\n[[File:Aaron Paul by Gage Skidmore 2.jpg|thumb|upright=0.5|Aaron Paul]]\n'''Jesse Bruce Pinkman''' (played by [[Aaron Paul]]) is a small-time methamphetamine user, manufacturer, and dealer. In high school, he was an indifferent student in Walter White's chemistry class. Now in his mid-20s, Jesse is Walt's business partner in the meth trade. Jesse is impulsive, hedonistic, and uneducated beyond high school, but he is financially ambitious and streetwise. He talks in playful slang, likes to wear garish clothing that follows the latest trends in youth culture, plays video games, listens to rap and rock music, takes recreational drugs, and drives [[lowrider]]s. Walt treats Jesse like a foolish son in constant need of stern correction. Jesse's own family kicked him out of their house because of his drug use. Despite the friction between them, he and Walt have a deep bond of loyalty. As a result of his relationship with Walt, Jesse becomes an excellent meth cook, ultimately leading to his exploitation by others. Despite his criminal lifestyle, Jesse is far more conscientious than Walt.  He is horrified, particularly during later seasons, by the brutality at the higher levels of the drug trade, but remains involved with Walt because he is not sure what else he can do. He is very protective of children; his desire to keep children out of the violent drug world gives rise to several key events throughout the series. He wrestles with feelings of guilt about the deaths, all drug-related, of people he has been associated with. Towards the end of the fifth season he is overwhelmed by guilt and his \"blood money.\"  Realizing how much pain he has caused for money leads him to attempt to give bundles of cash from his final payoff to people he knows and then throw them from his car window onto random lawns and porches. In ''[[El Camino: A Breaking Bad Movie]]'', Jesse departs for a new life in [[Alaska]].\n\n====Hank Schrader====\n{{see also|Hank Schrader}}\n[[File:Dean Norris by Gage Skidmore 2.jpg|thumb|upright=0.5|Dean Norris]]\n'''Hank Schrader''' (played by [[Dean Norris]]) is Walt and Skyler's brother-in-law and Marie's husband, who works as a U.S. [[Drug Enforcement Administration]] (DEA) agent. He is involved in investigating a meth dealer known as \"Heisenberg,\" unaware for over a year that his prey is actually Walter. Hank has a cavalier exterior, but in reality the dark side of his job affects him more than he cares to admit. In the course of his work, Hank is promoted to El Paso, Texas from Albuquerque for a short time but experiences a traumatic event and moves back to Albuquerque. Despite his brashness, Hank is highly competent at his job and cares deeply about his family. Hank is eventually promoted to Assistant Special Agent in Charge of the DEA in Albuquerque but is still determined to solve the \"Heisenberg\" case, which ultimately leads to his demise.\n{{clear}}\n\n====Marie Schrader====\n[[File:Betsy Brandt by Gage Skidmore.jpg|thumb|upright=0.5|left|Betsy Brandt]]\n{{Infobox character\n| color = #13613A\n| name = Marie Schrader\n| series = [[Breaking Bad]]\n| image = \n| caption =\n| creator = [[Vince Gilligan]]\n| portrayer = [[Betsy Brandt]]\n| first = \"[[Pilot (Breaking Bad)|Pilot]]\" (2008)\n| last = \"[[Felina (Breaking Bad)|Felina]]\" (2013)\n| occupation = Radiologic Technician at Kleinman Radiology Center\n| spouse = [[#Hank Schrader|Hank Schrader]] \n| children = \n| family = {{Plainlist|\n* [[#Walter White|Walter White]]  (brother-in-law)\n* [[#Skyler White|Skyler White]] (sister)\n* [[#Walter White, Jr.|Walter White, Jr.]] (nephew)\n* [[#Holly White|Holly White]] (niece)\n}}\n}}\n'''Marie Schrader''' (n\u00e9e '''Lambert''') (played by [[Betsy Brandt]]) is Skyler's sister, Hank's wife, and Walt's sister-in-law.

She shoplifts compulsively-apparently a manifest symptom of [[kleptomania]]\u2014a behavior for which she sees a therapist. She appears self-centered and shallow, but is very devoted to her husband and cares deeply for her sister's family. Nearly all of her household and clothing items are shades of the color purple.\n\nIn Season 3, Marie becomes a major source of comfort and support to her husband, when [[#Leonel and Marco Salamanca|The Cousins]] shoot and nearly kill him. With Walt and Skyler's help, she arranges for Hank to undergo an aggressive physical-therapy program their insurance does not cover. When Hank stubbornly decides to stay at the hospital, claiming he is completely disabled, she refuses to give up on him and masturbates him to prove he still has feeling below the waist. When he returns home, however, Hank is cold and brash to Marie, despite her attempts to make him comfortable, and she spirals back into kleptomania. Once Hank starts making progress with the case, his relationship with Marie improves again. When Walt and Skyler have marital problems, she volunteers to take in their children for a couple of days while they work things out.\n\nIn the final season, Hank shares with Marie the truth about Walter's criminal activities, and Marie confronts Skyler. Learning Skyler knew of Walt before Hank was shot, Marie slaps her sister and storms out of the room. She tries to take Holly with her, but Hank commands her to return the baby. She then urges Hank \"to get\" Walter. Marie helps Hank try to stop Walt and Skyler, but their attempts are thwarted when Walt makes a DVD framing Hank. Marie is eager to help Hank when Jesse agrees to confess about Walt's crimes. She is initially unaware of Hank's death and reconciles with Skyler on the condition she tells Walt Jr. everything. Marie learns that Hank is missing when Walt kidnaps Holly, and eventually receives confirmation he is dead. She is last seen in her house two months later, now with blue instead of purple trim around the house, warning Skyler to be on the lookout for Walt.\n\n==== Walter White Jr. ====\n[[File:RJ Mitte by Gage Skidmore 2.jpg|thumb|upright=0.5|left|RJ Mitte]]\n{{Infobox character\n| color = #13613A\n| name = Walter White Jr.\n| series = [[Breaking Bad]]\n| image = \n| caption = \n| full_name = Walter Hartwell White Jr.\n| creator = [[Vince Gilligan]]\n| portrayer = [[RJ Mitte]]\n| first=\"[[Pilot (Breaking Bad)|Pilot]]\" (2008)\n| last=\"[[Felina (Breaking Bad)|Felina]]\" (2013)\n| occupation = Student\n| alias = Flynn\n| children = \n| family = {{Plainlist|\n* [[#Walter White|Walter White]]  (father)\n* [[#Skyler White|Skyler White]] (mother)\n* [[#Marie Schrader|Marie Schrader]] (maternal aunt)\n* [[#Hank Schrader|Hank Schrader]]  (maternal uncle)\n* [[#Holly White|Holly White]] (sister)\n}}\n}}\n'''Walter Hartwell White Jr.''' (played by [[RJ Mitte]]) is Walter and Skyler's teenage son and Holly's older brother.

Angered by his parents' constant fighting, Walter Jr. tries to establish an independent identity, insisting on being called Flynn and asking his best friend Louis to teach him how to drive. When he discovers that Walt has cancer, Walter Jr. changes his attitude and sets up a website, \"www.savewalterwhite.com,\" which requests and collects donations in an effort to help pay for Walt's cancer treatment. Walt's lawyer, [[#Saul Goodman|Saul Goodman]], arranges for a wave of fictional \"donations\" drawn from Walter's drug money, in order to launder it and also make Walter Jr.'s efforts appear successful. When Skyler and Walt separate, Walter Jr., given no explanation by either parent, only sees that his mother has (from his point of view) inexplicably thrown his terminally ill father out of the house, and he takes his father's side and stops answering to the name Flynn. Always being \"late to the game\" (as defined by Mitte on an episode of ''[[Talking Bad]]''), Walter Jr. remains oblivious to his father's drug trade life until \"[[Ozymandias (Breaking Bad)|Ozymandias]],\" when Marie, confident that Walt is in Hank's custody, forces Skyler to reveal the whole truth to her son. Upon learning of his father's connection with Hank's death, Walter Jr. mistakenly concludes that Walt killed Hank. Feeling betrayed Jr. calls [[911 (number)|911]] when Walt fends off Skyler's knife attack, thus forcing Walt to leave and eventually end up on the [[most wanted list]]. In \"[[Granite State (Breaking Bad)|Granite State]],\" Walt attempts to talk to him over the phone and have him retrieve $100,000 that Walt planned to send to Louis' address; however, Walter Jr. angrily refuses and hangs up. In \"[[Felina (Breaking Bad)|Felina]],\" Walt visits Skyler for the final time, and watches from afar as Walter Jr. returns to the [[safe house]] from school.\n{{clear}}\n\n====Saul Goodman====\n{{see also|Saul Goodman|l1=Saul Goodman}}\n[[File:Bob Odenkirk by Gage Skidmore.jpg|thumb|upright=0.5|Bob Odenkirk]]\n'''Saul Goodman''' (played by [[Bob Odenkirk]]), real name '''James \"Jimmy\" Morgan McGill''', is a sleazy lawyer who acts as Walter and Jesse's attorney and provides some of the series' [[comic relief]]. He uses the name \"Saul Goodman\" because he thinks his clients feel more confident with a Jewish lawyer; this name is also [[homophonous]] with the expression \"[it]'s all good, man.\"<ref name=\"Saul\">{{cite web|url=http://nymag.com/arts/tv/reviews/breaking-bad-nussbaum-review-2011-8/|title=My \u2018Breaking Bad\u2019 Bender and the cold hard truths of the morning after|author=Nussbaum, Emily|work=[[New York (magazine)|New York magazine]]|date=July 24, 2011|accessdate=September 8, 2012}}</ref> Dressing in flashy suits, Saul maintains extensive connections within the criminal underworld and serves as a go-between connecting drug distributors, evidence removers, impersonators, and other criminals-for-hire. Despite his flamboyant appearance and mannerisms\u2014punctuated by his outrageous low-budget TV commercials\u2014Saul is a highly competent lawyer who is able to solve problems and find loopholes in order to protect his clients. He is also reluctant to be associated with violence or murder.\n\nHis background is explored in ''Better Call Saul'', taking place about six years before ''Breaking Bad''. Jimmy had been arrested in Chicago as a con man, but his older brother Charles \"Chuck\" McGill, a partner in an Albuquerque law firm, freed him of those charges on the condition Jimmy would return with him to find legitimate employment. Jimmy became inspired to enter the legal profession due to Chuck, and though he earned his degree, found that Chuck had conspired behind the scenes to prevent him from finding any type of respectable legal work short of public defense. After Chuck's death and losing his license to practice for a year, Jimmy returned to practice under the \"Saul Goodman\" name, drawing on the criminal clientele he had gained through his side business of selling disposable cell phones over the year before.\n\nBy the time of ''Breaking Bad'', Saul has established an office in a strip mall and advertises across the city. He works with [[#Gustavo Fring|Gus]] and [[#Mike Ehrmantraut|Mike]] to help cover their drug business, and helps introduce [[#Walter White|Walter]] and [[#Jesse Pinkman|Jesse]] to Gus as a potential buyer. Subsequently, he helps Walter and [[#Skyler White|Skyler]] launder the drug money, and provides legal assistance for Jesse and his drug-dealing friends. As fallout between Gus and Walter plays out, and Hank discovers Walter's identity as Heisenberg, Saul uses the \"disappearing\" services of [[#Ed Galbraith|Ed]] to relocate to Omaha, Nebraska under the name Gene Takavic (as shown in flash-forwards in ''Better Call Saul''), where he runs a [[Cinnabon]] store while remaining paranoid that someone may identify him from his past.\n\n====Gus Fring==== <!-- Redirect(s) from: Los Pollos Hermanos -->\n{{see also|Gus Fring}}\n[[File:Giancarlo Esposito by Gage Skidmore.jpg|thumb|upright=0.5|Giancarlo Esposito]]\n'''Gustavo Fring''' (played by [[Giancarlo Esposito]]) is the [[Chile]]an-born proprietor of Los Pollos Hermanos, a highly successful [[fried chicken]] restaurant chain. He is also a public [[boosterism|booster]] for the local DEA office and a member of the hospital board. However, despite outward appearances, Gus is a major drug kingpin initially affiliated with the [[Mexico|Mexican]] drug cartel in Ciudad Ju\u00e1rez, who uses his restaurants as a front for [[methamphetamine]] distribution throughout the [[American southwest]]. Like [[Walter White (Breaking Bad)|Walter White]], Gus is a criminal who \"hides in plain sight,\" using his anti-drug philanthropy to conceal his true nature. Gus originally established Los Pollos Hermanos in Mexico several years previously, but emigrated to the [[United States]] when [[List of Breaking Bad characters#Don Eladio Vuente|Don Eladio]] and [[Hector Salamanca]] murdered his cook and close friend, [[Maximino Arciniega]], as punishment for insulting Eladio. As shown in ''Better Call Saul'', Gus had long sought revenge on Hector for Max's death, and when Nacho causes Hector to have a stroke, Gus uses the opportunity to pay for Hector's recovery but only to a point where Hector has awareness of what is going on and can move his right finger, leaving him otherwise paralyzed to a wheelchair for the rest of his life. Subsequently, through both series, Gus seeks to supply his own source of drugs and eliminate the reliance on the Cartel, building a \"superlab\" underneath an industrial laundromat where large batches of meth can be cooked without discovery. Gus initially has plans for [[#Gale Boetticher|Gale]] to be his cook, but when he discovers the superior quality of Walter's blue meth, he has Walter become his cook, reluctantly allowing Jesse to join him. This leads to a series of confrontations that sees Walter having Jesse kill Gale,  causing the relationship between Gus and Walter fall out while Gus draws in Jesse as an ally. Walter goads Jesse to help lure Gus into a trap to visit Hector at a nursing home. Gus realizes too late it is a trap as Hector sets off Walter's homemade pipe bomb, killing himself and Gus. In the investigation of Gus' death, the police make ties between Gus and Mike's associates, and Walter is forced to kill Mike to keep the authorities off his trail.\n\n====Mike Ehrmantraut====\n{{see also|Mike Ehrmantraut}}\n[[File:Jonathan Banks 2012 2.jpg|thumb|upright=0.5|Jonathan Banks]]\n'''Mike Ehrmantraut''' (played by [[Jonathan Banks]]) is a former [[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania|Philadelphia]] police officer who works for [[Gus Fring|Gus]]\u2014and, on occasion, [[Saul Goodman (Breaking Bad)|Saul]]\u2014as a private investigator, head of security, [[cleaner (crime)|cleaner]], and [[hit man]]. In the ''Better Call Saul'' episode \"[[Gloves Off (Better Call Saul)|Gloves Off]]\", it is implied that Mike is a [[United States Marine Corps|Marine Corps]] veteran of the [[Vietnam War]].  His reasons for leaving the Philadelphia police are never specified during ''Breaking Bad'', but given his story to Walt about missing a chance to kill an abusive perpetrator who eventually murdered a victim Mike was trying to help, and Hank's refusal to bring up the reason for Mike's departure from the police, it is implied that Mike decided to take revenge against the abuser, which resulted in Mike's departure. As a result, one of the lessons Mike employed in his criminal activities was to not take \"half measures.\" The prequel series ''[[Better Call Saul]]'' revealed that Mike, a crooked cop, murdered two other crooked cops who had killed his son Matt, also a police officer, after Matt hesitated to involve himself in corruption. The next day (circa 2002) Mike fled to Albuquerque to be near his granddaughter Kaylee (played by Kaija Roze Bales) and daughter-in-law Stacey.  He initially worked as a parking attendant at the Albuquerque courthouse, where the evening and night hours often enabled him to take part in criminal activities during the day.  Mike is a calm and calculating individual who efficiently performs his duties for Gus, using his extensive knowledge of police procedure to do so without detection. Prior to his murder of [[List of Breaking Bad and Better Call Saul characters#Werner Ziegler|Werner Ziegler]] he is shown to go to extreme lengths to avoid killing anyone or targeting innocent bystanders. Mike makes a cameo in ''[[El Camino: A Breaking Bad Movie]]'' where he and Jesse discuss their plans before quitting the drug business. It is Mike's suggestion of a new life in [[Alaska]] that drives Jesse's ambitions following his escape from Jack Welker's gang.\n\n====Lydia Rodarte-Quayle====\n{{Infobox character\n| color = #13613A\n| name = Lydia Rodarte-Quayle\n| series = [[Breaking Bad]] / [[Better Call Saul]]\n| image = \n| caption =\n| creator = [[Vince Gilligan]]\n| portrayer = [[Laura Fraser]]\n| first = {{Plainlist|\n* '''''Breaking Bad''''':\n* \"[[Madrigal (Breaking Bad)|Madrigal]]\" (2012)\n* '''''Better Call Saul''''':\n* \"[[Off Brand]]\" (2017)\n}}\n| last = {{Plainlist|\n* '''''Breaking Bad''''':\n* ''[[El Camino: A Breaking Bad Movie#Snow Globe: A Breaking Bad Short|Snow Globe]]'' (2020)\n* '''''Better Call Saul''''':\n* \"[[JMM (Better Call Saul)|JMM]]\" (2020)\n}}\n| occupation = {{Plainlist|\n* Executive at Madrigal Electromotive [[GmbH]]\n* Drug smuggler\n}}\n| alias = \n| children = Kiira Rodarte-Quayle (daughter)\n| significant_other = Todd Alquist \n}}\n[[File:Laura_Fraser_discusses_Loch_Ness_with_Moobys.jpg|thumb|left|upright=0.5|Laura Fraser]]\n'''Lydia Rodarte-Quayle''' (played by [[Laura Fraser]]) is an executive of Madrigal Electromotive [[GmbH]], working out of the company's office in [[Houston, Texas]]. She originally worked with [[Gus Fring]] as a supplier of chemicals required for his drug business in the [[American southwest]]. Following his violent death at the hands of Walter, the [[Drug Enforcement Administration|DEA]] begins investigating the link between Gus and Madrigal. Lydia becomes anxious and asks Mike to eliminate 11 people who were involved with Gus and could expose her. When he refuses, Lydia makes the same offer to one of the 11 on her hit list and adds Mike to it. However, Mike ambushes and kills the new hit man, and deduces that Lydia is responsible. He consequently breaks into Lydia's home, ready to execute her, but allows her to live contingent on her providing [[methylamine]] for a new meth operation to be run by Walt, Jesse, and Mike.\n\nAfter Lydia provides the first shipment, the DEA visits Madrigal and Lydia is forced to give up her man in the warehouse to the DEA. When Mike sends Jesse to Houston to pick up the next shipment, he and Lydia find a GPS tracker at the bottom of one of the barrels. Mike guesses that Lydia placed it because she wants out of the business, and again vows to kill her. After bugging Hank's office, they find that the tracker was planted by the DEA's Houston office.  Lydia provides Walt, Jesse, and Mike information about a freight train that includes a tanker car full of methylamine, enabling a 1,000-gallon heist which ensures they can continue cooking meth almost indefinitely. Later, she provides Walt with a new market in the [[Czech Republic]], using her resources and network to distribute the meth in large quantities.\n\nAfter Walt quits, Declan and his gang take over the meth business, but produce a poor quality product. Lydia and Jack's gang arrange the massacre of Declan's crew, after which Jack's gang takes the methylamine and begins running Declan's business, later kidnapping Jesse to cook a better product for them. Months later, during a meeting with Todd, Walt (now a wanted criminal) interrupts a regular coffee shop meeting between Lydia and Todd to offer a new method of meth production. Lydia appears to agree to Walt's offer, but after Walt leaves she suggests to Todd that Walt should be killed at the meeting. That evening Lydia is obviously ill and calls Todd to check on whether the gang killed Walt. Walt answers Todd's phone and tells her that Jack and his gang are all dead and she will soon be dead too, because he added ricin to the [[stevia]] she used in her tea during the meeting at the coffee shop. In the 2019 movie ''[[El Camino: A Breaking Bad Movie]]'', Jesse hears a radio news report that confirms Walt's death and mentions that a woman from Houston, presumably Lydia, is critically ill after having been poisoned.  The report indicates that her suspected ties to Walt are being investigated, and that she is not expected to survive.\n\nLydia reappears in season 3 of ''Better Call Saul''. She is initially revealed to have assisted Gus in acquiring the laundry facility that he will use for the superlab. Later, when Mike decides that he needs Gus to help him clean the money he acquired from robbing one of Hector's trucks, Gus arranges for Lydia to launder it through Madrigal, with Mike receiving $10,000 per week as a contracted security consultant.\n\n====Todd Alquist====\n[[File:Jesse Plemons (20769593584).jpg|thumb|left|upright=0.5|Jesse Plemons]]\n{{Infobox character\n| color = #13613A\n| name = Todd Alquist\n| series = [[Breaking Bad]]\n| image = \n| caption =\n| creator = [[Peter Gould (writer)|Peter Gould]] <br> [[Vince Gilligan]]\n| portrayer = [[Jesse Plemons]]\n| first = \"[[Hazard Pay]]\" (2012)\n| last = ''[[El Camino: A Breaking Bad Movie#Snow Globe: A Breaking Bad Short|Snow Globe]]'' (2020)\n| occupation = {{Plainlist|\n* Pest exterminator for Vamonos Pest\n* [[Methamphetamine|Meth]] manufacturer\n}}\n| alias = \n| children = \n| family = [[#Jack Welker|Jack Welker]] (uncle)\n| significant_other = Lydia Rodarte-Quayle\n}}\n'''Todd Alquist'''<ref name=\"Todd Alquist\">{{cite web |url=http://www.amctv.com/shows/breaking-bad/cast/todd-alquist |title=Todd Alquist |publisher=AMC |accessdate=November 20, 2013}}</ref> (played by [[Jesse Plemons]]) is an exterminator for Vamonos Pest, a [[fumigation]] company used by [[Walter White (Breaking Bad)|Walt]], Mike, and [[Jesse Pinkman|Jesse]] as the [[Front organization|front]] for their meth business after [[Gus Fring]]'s death. Todd and the other Vamonos employees are also burglars, gathering information from the houses they tent and selling it to outside parties. Todd notices and disables a [[nanny cam]] at Walt and Jesse's first post-Gus Fring cook site, attracting their attention to someone they think might be useful in the future. He aids in the heist of [[methylamine]] from a freight train, and gives a friendly wave to a boy who stumbles on the crime scene, but then shoots him without warning. The team reluctantly keeps Todd employed after the murder, accepting his explanation that he assumed there could be no witnesses to the crime or they all risked arrest. Todd's explanation, plus his claims that his uncle runs a gang with connections that could be valuable to the meth operation, convince Walt, Jesse, and Mike to keep him alive.\n\nAfter Jesse and Mike quit, Todd becomes Walt's assistant in the cooking process. Todd respectfully refers to Walter as \"Mr. White\", and after studying under Walt, he spends his breaks going over his notes, but refuses to accept payment until he satisfies Walt's standards. After Walt kills Mike, Todd helps dispose of Mike's car and body, and Walt uses Jack's prison connections to eliminate Gus's nine living former employees and their lawyer to keep them from exposing Walt.\n\nAfter the gang captures Jesse, Todd convinces his uncle to force Jesse to cook for them instead of killing him. Jesse creates a batch with a level of purity comparable to Walt's. Thinking he deserves a reward for a job well done, Todd brings him ice cream and praises him for his skill. Todd's bad side is again on display when he shoots and kills Jesse's ex-girlfriend [[List of Breaking Bad characters#Andrea Cantillo|Andrea]] to punish Jesse for an escape attempt, but he politely apologizes before he shoots her. Months later, Walter kills Jack's gang by remotely firing an [[M60 machine gun]] installed in the trunk of a car. Todd survives, but Jesse strangles him with the chains of his handcuffs, choking him hard enough to snap his neck.\n\nTodd's alternating from charming politeness and respectful gestures to sudden violent acts led his character to be called the most dangerous villain on ''Breaking Bad'', and [[IGN]] named him 2013's best TV villain.<ref name=\"2013Best\">{{cite news|url=http://www.ign.com/wikis/best-of-2013/Best_TV_Villain |title=Best TV Villain \u2013 IGN's Best of 2013 |publisher=[[IGN]]. |accessdate=January 13, 2014}}</ref><ref name=\"Li, Shirley\">{{cite web |author=Li, Shirley |title=Forget Gus: Todd is the most dangerous villain on 'Breaking Bad' |url=http://popwatch.ew.com/2013/09/17/breaking-bad-dangerous-villain-todd/ |work=Entertainment Weekly |date=September 17, 2013 |accessdate=October 5, 2013}}</ref>\n\nIn ''[[El Camino: A Breaking Bad Movie]]'', Todd appears in flashbacks that take place after Jesse's failed escape attempt and Andrea's death. Todd, Kenny, and Neil Kandy torment Jesse as Neil builds his new restraints. Todd later enlists Jesse's help to add a canopy to his El Camino and bury the body of Todd's cleaning lady, whom he murdered after she accidentally found his hidden money. After Jesse's escape from the compound, he returns to Todd's apartment and retrieves the cash to use in his escape from Albuquerque.\n\n=== Introduced in ''Better Call Saul'' ===\n==== Kim Wexler ====\n{{See also|Kim Wexler}}\n[[File:Rhea Seehorn at the LA Art Show 2016.jpg|thumb|upright=0.5|Rhea Seehorn]]\n'''Kimberly Wexler''' (portrayed by [[Rhea Seehorn]]) was one of the key litigators at Hamlin, Hamlin & McGill. However, Kim's personal history with Jimmy complicated their working relationship, often putting her at odds with Howard Hamlin and Chuck McGill, threatening her promising career and eventually putting her in Hamlin's doghouse. This forced her to reevaluate her place in HHM and decide to leave, and she set up a practice of her own, sharing office space and expenses with Jimmy, but in separate firms. Despite this, because of their feud, she finds herself still in the middle of the dispute between Chuck and Jimmy.\n{{clear}}\n\n==== Howard Hamlin ====\n{{See also|Howard Hamlin}}\n[[File:Patrick Fabian on the Bellin Run 2011.jpg|thumb|upright=0.5|Patrick Fabian]]\n'''Howard Hamlin''' (portrayed by [[Patrick Fabian]]) is the name partner and general go-to guy toeing the company line for hugely successful Albuquerque law firm Hamlin, Hamlin & McGill. Howard is one of life's winners. His good fortune, sun-kissed looks, and more than ample charm prove to be a constant source of frustration for Jimmy as is his relationship with Chuck McGill.\n\nAfter Chuck steps away from the firm due to his claim of electromagnetic hypersensitivity, Howard covers for him trying to avoid Chuck's condition from being reported to the insurance agency. He always follows Chuck's instructions to keep Jimmy from achieving any type of success in the legal business. After Jimmy doctors the paperwork that Chuck had done for the Mesa Verde bank, costing the firm the client, Chuck secretly records a confession from Jimmy about the doctored papers, and Howard helps Chuck to confirm the account. Chuck presents the evidence to have Jimmy disbarred, but Jimmy uses the opportunity to expose Chuck's supposed hypersensitivity as a psychological aliment. The firms agency discovers this, and demands Howard either terminate Chuck or they will drastically raise their rates. Howard is forced to release Chuck. Due to an argument with Jimmy, Chuck kills himself later the same day, and Howard comes to bear the weight of causing Chuck's death. For much of a year, Howard remains emotionally withdrawn and works to regain the firm's standing following those events.\n{{clear}}\n\n==== Nacho Varga ====\n{{See also|Nacho Varga}}\n'''Ignacio Varga''' (portrayed by [[Michael Mando]]) is a calculating, intelligent career criminal. He is the right-hand man to Tuco Salamanca, heir to the crime family of the same name. While not yet a kingpin himself, Nacho is bright and has the ear of his terrifying boss. Nacho hires Jimmy as his lawyer after being introduced to him by Tuco at the start of Season 1. He secretly begins working with Mike Ehrmantraut at the end of season 1. He admires Mike's calm and calculated approach, especially when compared to Tuco's impulsive and irrational way of working. After secretly working with Mike to get Tuco sent to prison, Nacho becomes fearful that Tuco's uncle Hector will discover this and harm him or his father, and takes the step of replacing Hector's heart medication with placebos. During a key meeting between Hector and Gus, Hector has a heart attack due to the placebo, and Gus catches Nacho trying to switch back the pills. Because of this, Gus forces Nacho to become his mole in Hector's organization, quietly gaining information and performing small tasks behind the scenes to disrupt the Salamanca's sales.\n{{clear}}\n\n==== Chuck McGill ====\n{{See also|Chuck McGill}}\n[[File:Michael McKean 1999.jpg|thumb|upright=0.5|Michael McKean]]\n'''Charles Lindbergh McGill Jr.''' (portrayed by [[Michael McKean]]) is Jimmy McGill's older brother.

A brilliant man who holds himself and others to high ideals, Chuck firmly believes that doing the right thing is the only true path to success. Chuck is critical of Jimmy's background as a scam-artist, considering his brother's attorney status an insult to the law.\n\nChuck believes he suffers from [[electromagnetic hypersensitivity]], an unusual affliction caused by mysterious circumstances, which makes it challenging for him to lead a normal life. He has twice shown no reaction to sources of electromagnetic radiation that were nearby but whose presence he was unaware of, suggesting that he suffers from a mental illness rather than the physical condition he claims.\n\nIn the season 3 finale \"Lantern,\" after suffering a severe relapse of his condition, Chuck commits suicide by intentionally knocking over a lantern, which causes a fatal fire.\n{{clear}}\n\n==== Lalo Salamanca ====\n{{see also|Lalo Salamanca}}\n'''Eduardo \"Lalo\" Salamanca''' (portrayed by [[Tony Dalton]]) is another of Hector's nephews, introduced in season 4 of ''Better Call Saul''.  He arrives from Mexico soon after Hector's stroke to help run the family's drug operation, and takes a greater interest in the day-to-day details than Hector did, which makes Nacho uneasy.  Lalo visits Hector in the nursing home and gives him the gift of a front desk call bell, which Lalo kept as a souvenir after Hector killed a hotelier and burned down the building after the hotel owner was disrespectful to him.  Lalo attaches the bell to Hector's wheelchair, enabling him to communicate more effectively with his right index finger, the only body part Hector can move after he emerges from his coma.  Lalo thanks Gus for giving Hector first aid and paying for his care, but also surveils Gus's subordinates in order to learn their regular activities. When Werner escapes from Mike's supervision, Lalo becomes aware that Werner was constructing something for Gus, and becomes more suspicious of Gus's intentions with the cartel.\n{{clear}}\n\n==Supporting characters==\n===Cast table===\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\" style=\"width:210px;\" | Character !! style=\"width:150px;\" rowspan=\"2\"| Portrayed by !! colspan=\"6\"| ''[[Breaking Bad]]'' !! colspan=\"5\"| ''[[Better Call Saul]]'' !! rowspan=\"2\" style=\"width:175px;\" | [[El Camino: A Breaking Bad Movie|''El Camino:<br />{{small|A Breaking Bad Movie}}'']]\n|-\n! style=\"width:80px;\"| [[Breaking Bad (season 1)|1]] !! style=\"width:80px;\"| [[Breaking Bad (season 2)|2]] !! style=\"width:80px;\"| [[Breaking Bad (season 3)|3]] !! style=\"width:80px;\"| [[Breaking Bad (season 4)|4]] !! style=\"width:80px;\"| [[Breaking Bad (season 5)#Part 1|5a]] !! style=\"width:80px;\"| [[Breaking Bad (season 5)#Part 2|5b]] !! style=\"width:80px;\"| [[Better Call Saul (season 1)|1]] !! style=\"width:80px;\"| [[Better Call Saul (season 2)|2]] !! style=\"width:80px;\"| [[Better Call Saul (season 3)|3]] !! style=\"width:80px;\"| [[Better Call Saul (season 4)|4]] !! style=\"width:80px;\"| [[Better Call Saul (season 5)|5]]\n|-\n!

Club]] |access-date=3 March 2020}}</ref>\n\n==== Steven Gomez ====\nSteven Gomez (played by [[Steven Michael Quezada]]) is Hank's [[Drug Enforcement Administration|DEA]] partner and friend since Season 1. He is knowledgeable about the inner workings of Mexican gangs. He does not seem to mind Hank's off-color remarks about his ethnicity. Gomez, or \"Gomey\" as Hank affectionately calls him, is promoted to El Paso after Hank witnesses a deadly attack on the Mexican border.

The pair then moved to Mexico and opened a chain of Los Pollos Hermanos chicken restaurants together. In the drug business, Max is the chemist; he cooked the crystal meth, samples of which he and Gus started giving away. These samples gained the attention of Don Eladio, a local drug lord, whom Max and Gus approached in the hope of convincing the Don to join them in the meth business. Don Eladio, unimpressed by these upstarts and nominally dismissive of selling methamphetamine in lieu of cocaine, had Hector kill Max on the patio of his mansion as Juan Bolsa watched. Gus is forced to watch his partner's fatal head wound bleed into the swimming pool, a vision that stays with him.

Gale agrees to take over the lab full-time after one more cook with Walt. Walt realizes that Gus plans to replace him and has Jesse locate Gale's address so that Walt can kill him to ensure Gus still requires Jesse and Walt's services. Before he can kill Gale, Mike and Victor bring Walt to the lab, where they intend to kill Walt. Walt convinces them to let him speak to Jesse under the pretense of luring Jesse to the lab to be killed. Instead, Walt tells Jesse to kill Gale as quickly as possible, before Victor can prevent it.

As Hank investigates Gale and discovers Gus's fingerprints inside the apartment, he begins to suspect Gus of being connected to the meth trade. Hank finally realizes that Walt is Heisenberg after finding a book of Whitman poems at Walt's house and seeing that the \"W.

W.\" standing for both Walt Whitman and Walter White.\n\n=====''Better Call Saul''=====\nGale briefly appears in ''Better Call Saul'' when Gus visits him at the university where he's working as a post-graduate student and researcher. Gus asks Gale to test the purity of several methamphetamine samples before starting construction of the \"superlab\", foreshadowing Gale's role in ''Breaking Bad''.  In the Season 4 episode \"[[Winner (Better Call Saul)|Winner]]\", Gus shows Gale the nearly completed meth lab under the industrial laundry, which is revealed to have been constructed according to Gale's design.\n\n====Duane Chow====\nDuane Chow (played by James Ning) is the owner of Golden Moth Chemical, an industrial chemical manufacturing company that supplies chemicals to Gus's drug empire.

Chow's captors are later killed by Mike, who shoots Chow in the hand for not telling Gus about the situation.<ref name=\"Full Measure\"/> After Gus's death, Chow starts being questioned by the DEA, as he was on Gus's payroll at the time of Gus's murder. Chow is also on the list of eleven men whom Lydia suggests that Mike kill before they can make a plea deal with the DEA (but Mike refuses). Lydia then hires one of the eleven, Chris Mara, to kill the other ten, and adds Mike to the list. Mara starts with Chow, whom he uses to lure Mike into a trap before shooting Chow in the head. Mike thwarts the attempt on his own life after getting from Chris the information Lydia gave him, and then kills Chris.<ref name=\"Madrigal\"/>\n\n====Ron Forenall====\nRon Forenall (played by Russ Dillon) is Mike Ehrmantraut's contact at Madrigal Electromotive's chemical warehouse in Houston.

He is indirectly killed by Hector during the latter's showdown with Gus.<ref name=\"Face Off\"/> He reappears in ''Better Call Saul'', where he and Victor serve as co-muscle for Gus.\n\n====Chris Mara====\nChris Mara (played by Christopher King) is one of Gus's henchmen and Mike Ehrmantraut's errand runners, who runs errands among Fring, the mules, and the dealers. One of his other side jobs is to assist Tyrus Kitt in monitoring who is coming and going through the doors of both the Albuquerque Police Department and the DEA's Albuquerque office.\n\nChris first appears in \"Bug,\" where he is shown taking cover when Gaff opens fire on the operatives at the Los Pollos distribution center, killing one of them while Jesse stands paralyzed.

However, Mike sees Chris's car parked in Chow's driveway and senses that this is a trap. Mike outsmarts Chris with a toy on Chow's front door while he sneaks into Chow's house from the back. Chris confesses that since the DEA seized his hazard pay, he took up Lydia's offer that Mike refused: $10,000 for each of the 10 other men on the list, and triple for Mike. Mike then dispatches Chris in the same way that Chris killed Chow.<ref name=\"Madrigal\"/>\n\n====Dennis Markowski====\nDennis Markowski (played by Mike Batayeh) is the former manager of Lavanderia Brilliante, the industrial laundromat which served as the cover for Gus's superlab. Following Gus's death, the DEA incarcerates Dennis, as he is on Gus's payroll at the time of Gus's death. Dennis agrees to keep his mouth shut when Mike ensures that he will still receive his money from the drug empire.<ref name = \"Hazard Pay\">{{cite episode | title = Hazard Pay | episodelink = Hazard Pay | series = Breaking Bad | serieslink = Breaking Bad | credits = [[Adam Bernstein]] (dir), [[Peter Gould (writer)|Peter Gould]] (wrt) | network = [[AMC (TV channel)|AMC]] | airdate = July 29, 2012 | season = 5 | number = 3}}</ref> When Dennis's funds are confiscated, Dennis, through his attorney, proposes a plea deal to the DEA, but [[Hank Schrader|Hank]] refuses, believing he can get a better deal from one of Gus's other incarcerated henchmen.

Gus instructs Victor to give half of the money for Jesse's meth to Walter as a way to convince Walter to cook again. After Walt kills two of Gus's dealers, Walt tells Gus that Jesse is \"at least two time zones away.\" Victor guards the lab at all times when Walter and Gale are present and monitors their conversations. Walt suspects Gus is preparing to kill him and conspires with Jesse to kill Gale, making Walt indispensable as the only remaining cook. Victor picks up Walt from his home, telling him there is a leak in the lab. Walt is greeted by Mike when he arrives and deduces they plan to kill him. Walt begs Mike to spare him, offering to turn Jesse over. Under the pretext of contacting Jesse to lure him to a meeting, Walt convinces Mike and Victor to allow him to call Jesse using his cell phone. However, instead of arranging a meeting, Walt instructs Jesse to kill Gale before Mike kills Walt, leaving Walter as the only chemist available to Gus. Victor races to stop Jesse from killing Gale but arrives too late; he enters Gale's apartment and is seen by neighbors.<ref name = \"Full Measure\" /> He then forces Jesse back to the meth lab and watches over him and Walt with Mike until Gus arrives. He reveals that he knows how to cook meth himself from watching Walt and singlehandedly begins preparing a full batch in front of him. However, when Gus arrives, he unexpectedly murders Victor by slicing his throat with a box cutter. Walt, Jesse, and Mike are then forced to dispose of Victor's body using [[hydrofluoric acid]], echoing Walt and Jesse's previous experience with Emilio.<ref name=\"Box Cutter\"/> Walt later mentions to Jesse that Gus may have killed Victor because he had taken inappropriate liberties (such as cooking meth while Mike held Walt and Jesse hostage) and \"[flown] too close to the sun,\" as Walt put it.<ref name = \"Hazard Pay\" />\n\n=====''Better Call Saul''=====\nVictor is a recurring character introduced alongside Gus in season 3, first seen driving a black Escalade to the back of Los Pollos Hermanos to obtain the tracking device used on Mike. He and Tyrus later serve as Gus's bodyguards during the meeting with Mike. After Hector's operation takes a crippling blow, Victor hands out a cash payment to Mike as a token of gratitude from Gus. However, Mike refuses it. He also delivers parcels of cocaine to Hector's men as part of Hector's order to have his drugs be smuggled in Los Pollos Hermanos trucks.\n\nVictor again appears as one of Gus's henchmen in season 4. He is first seen following Nacho Varga around after Nacho causes Hector to suffer a stroke. After Gus kills Arturo and blackmails Nacho, he sends Victor and Tyrus out with Nacho to the desert. The two men fake evidence of a shooting attack to cover up Nacho's involuntary defection, and pin Arturo's death on a Salamanca rival (while also making it look like a repeat of Mike's truck robbery). As part of the cover-up, Victor shoots Nacho, wounding him to make it \"look real\".\n\nIn season 5, Victor picks up one of Gus' henchmen after he escapes from [[Hank Schrader]] and Steven Gomez before calling Gus to report in.\n\n====Dan Wachsberger====\nDan Wachsberger (played by Chris Freihofer) is an attorney hired by Mike Ehrmantraut to represent Ron Forenall, Dennis Markowski, and the other seven surviving members of [[Gustavo Fring]]'s operation running out of the Lavanderia Brilliante in Albuquerque. Wachsberger takes the money (Mike Ehrmantraut's \"legacy costs\") from Mike and then deposits it to ten safety deposit boxes at the Cradock Marine Bank in Albuquerque: nine for Gus's surviving guys and their families to use in lieu of their \"hazard pay\" and one larger box for Mike's granddaughter Kaylee on her 18th birthday.\n\nWachsberger first appears as he and Mike are going through the [[New Mexico Department of Corrections]] facility at [[Los Lunas]] south of Albuquerque. Dan signs in and tells the attending guard, Darla, that he has brought in his \"paralegal\" and they have come to see Dennis Markowski.<ref name=\"Hazard Pay\"/> Dan is consistently shown flirting with women, such as Darla and, at the bank, with Dorothy Yobs, whom he routinely lavishes with gifts of sugary baked goods. Dorothy gives Dan access to the safety deposit boxes at Cradock Marine Bank. Eventually, Hank and Gomez discover Mike and Dan's transactions and their safety deposit boxes at Cradock Marine Bank, and Gomez is sent to investigate. Gomez and his agents discover Dan making his routine drops in these boxes, arrest him, and successfully induce Dan to give them Mike.<ref name = \"Say My Name\">{{cite episode | title = Say My Name | episodelink = Say My Name | series = Breaking Bad | serieslink = Breaking Bad | credits = [[Thomas Schnauz]] (dir, wrt) | network = [[AMC (TV channel)|AMC]] | airdate = August 26, 2012 | season = 5 | number = 7}}</ref>\n\nThe next and last time Wachsberger appears, he is in federal lockup at La Tuna near the Texas border outside of [[Las Cruces, New Mexico|Las Cruces]], when, on Walt's orders, he is stabbed to death at the same time the nine surviving members of Gus's operation are also killed off, including Ron Forenall and Dennis Markowski.<ref name = \"Gliding Over All\" />\n\n=== Mexican drug cartel ===\n\n====Eladio Vuente====\nDon Eladio Vuente (played by [[Steven Bauer]]) is the head of a drug cartel in Ciudad Ju\u00e1rez which employed Juan Bolsa, Hector Salamanca, and Salamanca's nephews. He first met Gus Fring at a business meeting twenty years prior to the start of the series, where Gus and his partner Max attempted to propose a business deal wherein they would produce methamphetamine for the cartel. Unimpressed by their pitch, Don Eladio had Max executed for manipulating him into a meeting, but spared Gus's life due to an unrevealed past in Chile.<ref name = \"Hermanos\" /> At some time in the ensuing few years, he entered into a partnership with Gus, who served as Don Eladio's chief distributor in the American Southwest.\n\nFollowing the deaths of Juan Bolsa and the Cousins, and Gus's subsequent establishment of the superlab, Don Eladio orders retribution through his henchman Gaff, hijacking meth deliveries and killing some of Gus's operatives. Gus agrees to Eladio's demands\u2014the formula for the blue meth, the services of a chemist, and a 50% share in the business\u2014and travels to the cartel's superlab with Mike and Jesse. After Jesse cooks a successful batch, Eladio invites the three to a party at his villa attended by multiple capos of the cartel, toasting their new business venture with a bottle of premium tequila supplied by Gus, and chiding the latter for needing to be kept in line every twenty years. However, shortly afterwards the capos begin to collapse, victims of a poison Gus had put in the tequila. Eladio realizes that Gus (who has vomited up some of the poisoned tequila then soon after is given an antidote after escaping to his prepared field hospital) has betrayed him, but he collapses dead into the swimming pool before he can take any action.<ref name = \"Salud\" />\n\nHe reappears in ''Better Call Saul'' through a flashback, meeting and ridiculing Hector in his hacienda because of his inferiority to Gus Fring.\n\n====Juan Bolsa====\nJuan Bolsa (played by Javier Grajeda) is a high-level member of the Mexican drug cartel to which the Salamanca family and Gus belong. It is Bolsa who orders Tortuga's execution by The Cousins and later places his head on a booby-trapped tortoise for the DEA to find. He is also the cartel's liaison with Gus, and the one who arranges a meeting among Gus, the Cousins, and Hector to determine how to handle Walter following Tuco's death. Bolsa tells Gus he will urge the Salamanca family to be patient but advises that Gus risks losing favor with the cartel if he does not finish his business with Walter quickly.  He goes on to say that he cannot guarantee the Cousins will listen to reason and leave Walter alive until his business with Gus is done.<ref name = \"I.F.T.\">{{cite episode | title = I.F.T. | episodelink = | series = Breaking Bad | serieslink = Breaking Bad | credits = [[Michelle MacLaren]] (dir), [[George Mastras]] (wrt) | network = [[AMC (TV channel)|AMC]] | airdate = April 4, 2010 | season = 3 | number = 3}}</ref> He has forbidden the Cousins to kill Hank, the person who killed Tuco, because DEA agents and other law enforcement officers are usually designated \"off limits\" since attacking them brings on more police scrutiny and enforcement. Gus secretly sanctions an attack on Hank instead of Walter, resulting in severe injuries to Hank and the deaths of The Cousins.  Bolsa meets his end when Gus secretly tips off Mexican [[federales]] in [[Ciudad Ju\u00e1rez]], who kill Bolsa as retaliation for The Cousins' attack on Hank.<ref name=\"I See You\"/>  His name, translated literally from Spanish, is John Bag or John Sack; this is a nod to the character [[John Sacramoni|John \"Johnny Sack\" Sacrimoni]] from the [[HBO]] [[television drama series|drama]] ''[[The Sopranos]]''.  Both characters are high-ranking members of powerful crime families who are very level-headed, well-spoken, and act as intermediaries between their families and others.\n\n=====''Better Call Saul''=====\nIn a flashback to 1999, Bolsa delivers Gus's tribute to Don Eladio at Eladio's hacienda. Hector, and Ximenez Lercerda, the Salamancas' driver and smuggler are there so Hector can pay tribute to Eladio, but Hector is humiliated by the size of Gus's tribute. In \"Lantern,\" Gus and Bolsa meet with Hector; Bolsa decrees that because Hector's trucking network has been disrupted, his drugs must be smuggled from Mexico through Gus's Los Pollos Hermanos trucks.  This enrages Hector, who wants to continue his own smuggling and not be reliant on Gus.  When Hector suffers a stroke, Bolsa flees to keep secret the connection between the Salamancas and Don Eladio.\n\n====Hector Salamanca====\nHector Salamanca (played by [[Mark Margolis]]) is the elderly [[Don (honorific)|Don]] who was once a brutal Mexican drug kingpin and an associate of cartel boss [[#Don Eladio Vuente|Don Eladio]]. However, a stroke has rendered him unable to walk or speak, and he communicates only by ringing a hotel's front desk call bell attached to his wheelchair. Despite this, he is still of sound mind. He is [[#Tuco Salamanca|Tuco Salamanca's]] uncle, having raised Tuco as a son, along with Tuco's twin cousins Leonel and Marco. Though brutal, Hector is very loyal. He spent 17 years in [[San Quentin State Prison]], never once revealing any information to the authorities. He taught his nephews that family is everything and lives by the creed himself. Hector loathes [[Gustavo Fring]], calling him \"chicken man\" (\"hombre gallina\" in Spanish, literally \"hen man\") and a \"dirty South American.\" Likewise, Gus despises Hector for killing [[#Maximino Arciniega|Max]]<ref name = \"Hermanos\" /> and goes out of his way to torment the former kingpin by allowing Hector to live while he sees his younger relatives die, one by one. \n\nIn the season 2 premiere, Tuco kidnaps Walt and Jesse and brings them to his disabled uncle Hector's decrepit shack of a home. Walt attempts to poison Tuco's food with a hidden vial of ricin, but Hector is shown to be of sound mind and he saves Tuco by knocking the food onto the floor.  After killing Tuco in a shootout, Hank Schrader takes Hector in for questioning.  Hector refuses to cooperate and defecates in his pants, much to the disgust of everyone in the interrogation room.  Afterwards, he is sent to a nursing home near Albuquerque.\n\nIn season 3, The Cousins sneak into the U.S. to perform a retaliatory killing to avenge Tuco.  They visit Hector, their uncle, who gives them Walter White's name. When the hit is narrowly avoided through the intervention of Mike and Gus, The Cousins bring Hector to a meeting with Gus. Gus is able to postpone the hit for the time being by telling Hector that Walt is invaluable to the cartel's methamphetamine operations.\n\nIn the season 4 finale, Walt is able to convince Hector to help him lure Gus into the open. Hector meets with Hank Schrader at the DEA building under the guise of becoming an informant. Walt's ploy works when Tyrus spots Hector leaving the DEA building. Suspecting Hector of being an informant, Tyrus alerts Gus. Gus and Tyrus plan to kill Hector during a meeting in his nursing home room and Gus orders Hector to look at him. When a sorrowful-looking Hector finally looks at Gus (something Gus wanted Hector to do all season), Hector's facial expression changes to wrath as he begins repeatedly ringing his bell. Gus realizes that the bell is attached to a bomb under Hector's wheelchair and tries to run, but is caught in the explosion. Hector and Tyrus are instantly killed, while Gus dies a few moments after leaving the room.<ref name = \"Face Off\" />\n\n=====''Better Call Saul''=====\nAfter Mike and Nacho sideline Tuco by provoking him into attacking Mike over a staged fender bender, Hector approaches Mike and offers him $5,000 to recant his testimony that Tuco was carrying a gun, which will reduce Tuco's sentence. Mike refuses, but Hector makes repeated attempts to intimidate Mike into accepting, from having men break into Mike's house to having The Cousins threaten Mike's granddaughter. Mike eventually accepts $50,000 for recanting his testimony.\n\nDespite complying with Hector's demands, Mike is not happy about the threats to Kaylee's life and retaliates by attacking an ice cream truck transporting Hector's drug cash. Hector kills a witness who stopped to aid the driver, and later has the Cousins kill the driver and bury him in the desert. While Hector and the Cousins are preparing to kill the driver, Mike attempts to shoot Hector with a sniper rifle, but is stopped by someone unseen, who sets off his car horn and leaves a note warning him not to do it. Mike later learns it was Gus who tracked his location and warned him against killing Hector; Gus intends to take over Hector's drug operation, and believes the time is not yet right.\n\nHector is in competition with Gus for control of cross-border drug smuggling. The conflict escalates after Mike attacks another of Hector's trucks, this time planting drugs and causing two of Hector's drivers to get arrested at the customs inspection station. Juan Bolsa directs Gus to take over transportation of Hector's drugs, not realizing this is exactly what Gus wants.\n\nAfter Hector starts planning to take over Nacho's father's business for his own use, Nacho turns on Hector and enacts a plan where he switches out Hector's heart medication for ibuprofen. Hector suffers a stroke while meeting with Gus and Juan Bolsa, but Gus saves him with CPR and he is taken to the hospital.\n\nGus arranges for a specialist, Dr. Maureen Bruckner, to be flown in from Johns Hopkins in Baltimore to oversee Hector's care. Over the next few months, her therapy regimen restores Hector's mental faculties, but he's unable to speak and he's immobile except for the index finger of his right hand. Gus has her discontinue treatment, effectively trapping his sound mind in his unhealed body.\n\n====Tuco Salamanca====\nTuco Salamanca (played by [[Raymond Cruz]]) is a [[Mexico|Mexican]] drug [[Boss (crime)|kingpin]] who becomes Walter and Jesse's meth distributor and the main antagonist of the second half of Season One and the beginning of Season Two. He is unpredictable and prone to violent outbursts. After Walt and Jesse witness him brutally assault and murder one of his henchmen, they plan to poison him by coating their next delivery of meth with [[ricin]]. The [[Drug Enforcement Administration]] (DEA) raids Tuco's headquarters before they can execute their plan. Tuco then [[carjacking|carjacks]] Jesse and kidnaps him and Walt, suspecting they reported the murder to the authorities.\n\nTuco forces Walt and Jesse into Jesse's trunk, and drives to the remote desert house of his uncle, [[#Hector Salamanca|Hector]], who cannot walk or speak due to a previous [[stroke]]. He reveals that his cousins Leonel and Marco are coming to the house to take them all to Mexico, where Walt will cook his blue meth for the cartel. Thinking Hector is unaware of his surroundings, Walt sprinkles Tuco's food with ricin while Tuco is not looking, but Hector foils the plan. Tuco realizes what Walt intended and attacks Jesse while threatening to kill him with an [[M16 rifle]]. During the ensuing scuffle, Jesse shoots Tuco in the abdomen.\n\n[[Hank Schrader|Hank]] arrives, having followed the [[LoJack]] signal of Jesse's car in the belief that Jesse is selling [[marijuana]] to Walt. Walt and Jesse hide nearby and see Tuco stagger to Jesse's car, recover his rifle, and fire at Hank. Hank returns fire with a [[Glock]] pistol and kills Tuco.<ref name=\"Grilled\"/> Hank's DEA colleagues present him a paperweight embedded with Tuco's [[Grill (jewelry)|grill]] as a trophy, which he initially prizes but later throws into a river in disgust.<ref name=\"Breakage\"/>\n\n=====''Better Call Saul''=====\nTuco reappears in ''[[Better Call Saul]]''. His first appearance comes after Cal and Lars, two skateboarding brothers working for [[Saul Goodman|Jimmy McGill]] accidentally target Tuco's grandmother for one of Jimmy's scams. Tuco and his crew take Jimmy, Cal, and Lars into the desert to kill them, but Jimmy talks Tuco into settling for breaking one leg of each skateboarder.\n\nIn season 2, Tuco's lieutenant, Nacho Varga, becomes wary of Tuco's violent methods and requests Mike's help to assassinate him. Instead, Mike designs a scheme to temporarily sideline Tuco by having him assault Mike in front of the police.  Tuco is charged for assault with a deadly weapon because of the gun he was carrying, but Hector bribes Mike to say the gun was his. Tuco is convicted of the lesser charge of simple assault, and receives a shorter prison sentence.  While in prison, Tuco stabs another inmate and injures a corrections officer, triggering an angina attack in Hector which starts Nacho on a plan to induce a fatal heart attack.  Tuco's sentence is extended, indicating that his release comes shortly before the events of ''Breaking Bad''.\n\n==== Leonel and Marco Salamanca ====\nLeonel and Marco Salamanca (played by [[Daniel and Luis Moncada]]), referred to as \"The Cousins\", are hitmen for a [[Ciudad Ju\u00e1rez]] Mexican drug cartel. Their austere, mechanical physicality and virtually non-verbal interaction makes them a fearsome presence and they kill without hesitation or emotion. Leonel and Marco's killings included the decapitation by [[machete]] of Tortuga, whose head was then attached to a tortoise as part of a bomb which inflicted casualties on several DEA agents.<ref name=\"I.F.T.\" />\n\nAs children, the Cousins were raised by Hector Salamanca, who once tested them when he stopped a boyhood fight by nearly drowning Marco, which forced Leonel to hit Hector to make him release his grip.  After Marco caught his breath, Hector reinforced the lesson that \"family is all.\"<ref name=\"One Minute\" /> Following the death of their cousin Tuco, Hector summoned them to New Mexico to kill Walter. En route to being smuggled into the US, they hid with other undocumented immigrants in the back of a hay truck, and killed the entire group when one recognized them by their silver skull boot tips.<ref name=\"No M\u00e1s\">{{Cite episode |title=No M\u00e1s |episode-link=No M\u00e1s (Breaking Bad) |series=Breaking Bad |series-link=Breaking Bad |network=[[AMC (TV channel)|AMC]] |date=March 21, 2010 |season=3 |number=1}}</ref>\n\nThe Cousins quickly tracked Walter to his house and were waiting inside to kill him when Mike informed Victor of their presence.  Victor told Gus, who contacted the cartel.  The Cousins then received a text message telling them to abort, so they left without Walter knowing they had been there.<ref name=\"Caballo sin Nombre\">{{Cite episode |title=Caballo sin Nombre |episode-link=Caballo sin Nombre |series=Breaking Bad |series-link=Breaking Bad |network=[[AMC (TV channel)|AMC]] |date=March 28, 2010 |season=3 |number=2}}</ref> Although Gus gave them permission to kill Walter after Gus's partnership with him ended three months later, Gus was warned that the Cousins would probably ignore the arrangement. Mike later found outside Walt's house a chalk drawing of a scythe, which he believed the Cousins have left to send the message that their murder of Walt was imminent.<ref name=\"I.F.T.\" />\n\nGus redirected the Cousins by telling them Hank killed Tuco, and he told them they had his permission to kill Hank even though the cartel refrained from killing law enforcement officers, because that would draw undue attention to their activities.  Leonel and Marco moved to kill Hank, but Gus anonymously warned Hank just before the confrontation.  Aware of the threat, Hank saw Leonel advancing on him and backed his car up quickly, trapping  Leonel between his car and another, which crushed Leonel's legs. Marco opened fire on Hank, who escaped out the passenger side door and crawled away. Marco strode after Hank, shooting and killing a passerby who surprised him, while another bystander escaped the same fate when Marco stopped to reload. Hank then surprised Marco from behind and shot him in the chest four times, but  all four bullets were stopped by Marco's [[bulletproof vest]]. Marco shot Hank twice in the chest, but rather than finish him off with another shot, Marco returned to his car for an axe. Hank took advantage of the pause to load Leonel's empty gun with a [[hollow-point]] round that Marco had dropped next to him.  When Marco re-approached Hank, Hank killed him with a shot to the head.<ref name=\"One Minute\" /><ref name=\"Sunset\" />\n\nTo silence Leonel while he was in the hospital following his leg amputation, Gus distracted the police assigned to the security detail by bringing them food from Los Pollos Hermanos, giving Mike the opportunity to sneak into Leonel's room and administer a lethal injection.  Leonel died, and Mike quietly disposed of the syringe he used, unnoticed by the police officers nearby.\n\n===== ''Better Call Saul'' =====\nThe Cousins reappeared in ''[[Better Call Saul]]'' as Hector's enforcers. They are first shown threatening Mike's granddaughter Kaylee when Mike refuses to recant his testimony against Tuco. When Mike is waiting to shoot Hector from a hilltop with a sniper rifle, he sees Leonel and Marco kill the Salamanca's ice cream truck driver and drug smuggler Ximenez Lecerda, who Mike had robbed a few days earlier.\n\nIn Season 4, after Gus blackmails Nacho into becoming a double agent, he has Nacho trick the Cousins into attacking the Espinosa gang. After wiping out the entire compound, they flee to Mexico to escape police scrutiny.\n\n====Gaff====\nGaff (played by Maurice Compte) is a member of Don Eladio's drug cartel. He is first seen coordinating the hijacking of a Los Pollos Hermanos truck that is transporting drugs and killing the guards inside by filling it with engine exhaust fumes. Gaff serves as the cartel's representative in a sitdown with Gus, where he rejects Gus's offer of $50 million to cut all ties and informs Gus there will be no negotiation, only an ultimatum to deliver the formula for the blue methamphetamine. Later, Gaff kills one of Gus's men with a sniper rifle at the chicken farm but stops shooting when Gus presents himself as a target and agrees to negotiate with Eladio. Gaff is present when the cartel is poisoned; Mike garrotes him as he checks on the ill Eladio.<ref name = \"Salud\">{{cite episode | title = Salud | episodelink = Salud (Breaking Bad)| series = Breaking Bad | serieslink = Breaking Bad | credits = [[Michelle MacLaren]] (dir), [[Peter Gould (writer)|Peter Gould]], [[Gennifer Hutchison]] (wrt) | network = [[AMC (TV channel)|AMC]] | airdate = September 19, 2011 | season = 4 | number = 10}}</ref>\n\n====Gonzo====\nGonzo (played by Jesus Payan Jr.) is Tuco Salamanca's brother-in-law and one of his lieutenants. He dies while moving No Doze's body from under a stack of cars in a junkyard; the stack shifts and catches his arm under it, partially severing it and causing him to [[exsanguination|bleed to death]]. When Walter and Jesse learn he is dead, they incorrectly assume that Tuco is killing any witnesses to No Doze's murder, and fear for their own lives.

Cartel operatives cut off his head and place it atop a tortoise (''tortuga'' is Spanish for \"tortoise\") with \"HOLA DEA\" (\"Hello DEA\") written across its shell. A hidden bomb in the head then explodes, killing the tortoise and a DEA agent, and severely injuring several of the DEA agents and Mexican policemen on the scene. Hank is physically unharmed as he was far enough from the explosion, but later develops [[Posttraumatic stress disorder|post-traumatic stress syndrome]].<ref name = \"Negro y Azul\">{{cite episode | title = Negro y Azul | episodelink = | series = Breaking Bad | serieslink = Breaking Bad | credits = [[F\u00e9lix Enr\u00edquez Alcal\u00e1|Felix Alcala]] (dir), [[John Shiban]] (wrt) | network = [[AMC (TV channel)|AMC]] | airdate = April 19, 2009 | season = 2 | number = 7}}</ref> It is later revealed that Tortuga was beheaded with a [[machete]] by Tuco's cousins [[#Leonel and Marco Salamanca|Leonel and Marco Salamanca]] under [[#Juan Bolsa|Juan Bolsa]]'s direct order.<ref name = \"I.F.T.\" />\n\n===Independent drug traders===\n\n====Declan====\nDeclan (played by [[Louis Ferreira]]) is a meth dealer who operates in [[Phoenix, Arizona]]. Mike attempts to sell Declan the methylamine stolen in the train robbery, but Walt suggests that Declan buy out Mike and Jesse, then take over distribution of Walt's methamphetamine in return for 35% of revenue, revealing that he is Heisenberg, the mysterious meth cooker whose product is renowned for its exceptional purity.<ref name=\"Say My Name\"/><ref name = \"Buyout\">{{cite episode | title = Buyout | episodelink = Buyout (Breaking Bad) | series = Breaking Bad | serieslink = Breaking Bad | credits = [[Colin Bucksey]] (dir), [[Gennifer Hutchison]] (wrt) | network = [[AMC (TV channel)|AMC]] | airdate = August 19, 2012 | season = 5 | number = 6}}</ref> After Walt stops producing meth, Lydia's customers express dissatisfaction with the product, so Lydia tries to convince Declan to replace his meth cook with Todd.

According to Jesse, they met when they were still in elementary school. In the \"Pilot\" episode, Emilio is arrested during a DEA raid on a house (at which Walter is present during a \"ride along\" with Hank) in which the DEA is looking for a meth supplier who goes by the street name \"Captain Cook\" (Jesse himself). As Jesse proposes Krazy-8 to manage the distribution of the superior quality methamphetamine he produced with his new partner, he realized that Emilio made bail. Suspicious that Jesse ratted him out to the police (although it is later revealed Krazy-8 was in fact a DEA informant), Emilio and Krazy-8 force Jesse to lead them to his new partner. Emilio recognizes Walter from the time of his arrest and suggests killing both Walter and Jesse. Walter convinces them to spare their lives if he teaches them his meth formula. While the three are in the RV, Walt deliberately causes a chemical explosion and flees, trapping Emilio and Krazy-8 inside the RV with deadly [[phosphine]] gas. Emilio dies and Jesse subsequently disposes of his body by dissolving it in [[hydrofluoric acid]], albeit disastrously as it also dissolves Jesse's bathtub.<ref name = \"Pilot\">{{cite episode | title = Pilot | episodelink = Pilot (Breaking Bad) | series = Breaking Bad | serieslink = Breaking Bad | credits = [[Vince Gilligan]] (director, writer) | network = [[AMC (TV channel)|AMC]] | airdate = January 20, 2008 | season = 1 | number = 1}}</ref><ref name = \"Cat's in the Bag...\">{{cite episode | title = Cat's in the Bag... | episodelink = | series = Breaking Bad | serieslink = Breaking Bad | credits = [[Adam Bernstein]] (dir), [[Vince Gilligan]] (wrt) | network = [[AMC (TV channel)|AMC]] | airdate = January 27, 2008 | season = 1 | number = 2}}</ref>\n\n==== Domingo Molina ====\nDomingo Gallardo \"Krazy-8\" Molina (played by Maximino Arciniega)<ref>{{cite web |title=Krazy-8's Breaking Bad Backstory (As Revealed In Better Call Saul) |url=https://screenrant.com/breaking-bad-krazy-8-backstory-better-call-saul/ |website=Screen Rant |accessdate=11 March 2020 |date=15 September 2019}}</ref> is a meth distributor associated with his cousin Emilio and Jesse Pinkman and is the main antagonist of the first half of Season One. Unbeknown to Walter and Jesse, Krazy-8 is a DEA informant, who acquired the customers of the dealers he ratted out. Krazy-8 becomes suspicious of Jesse when Jesse attempts to sell him a new product after Emilio's arrest, and Krazy-8 forces Jesse to take him to Jesse's new partner. Krazy-8 and Emilio suspect Walter is involved with law enforcement and appear intent on killing him until Walter offers to teach Krazy-8 his drug formula. While mixing chemicals, Walter creates a small explosion that produces [[phosphine]] gas which appears to kill both Emilio and Krazy-8. Emilio dies, but Krazy-8 regains consciousness, prompting Jesse and Walt to imprison him in Jesse's basement for several days as they ponder what to do with him.<ref name=\"Pilot\" /><ref name=\"Cat's in the Bag...\" /> Walt begins to bond with Krazy-8, who has regained his health, feeding him and sharing beers, and attempts to rationalize freeing him, but strangles him with a bicycle lock upon realizing that Krazy-8 plans to attack him with a concealed piece of a broken crockery.

Initially one of the dealers, he takes on a lieutenant role under Nacho after Hector Salamanca suffers a stroke and becomes paralyzed, and continues in this position when Lalo Salamanca arrives from Mexico to oversee operations. Lalo is the one to have given Domingo the nickname \"Ocho Loco\" (Spanish for \"Crazy Eight\") based on a bad poker hand he played during one of their games.<ref>{{cite web |title=Better Call Saul Reveals Silly Way Breaking Bad's Krazy-8 Got His Name |url=https://screenrant.com/better-call-saul-season-5-krazy-8-breaking-bad-nickname-explained/ |website=ScreenRant |accessdate=3 April 2020 |date=26 February 2020}}</ref> Krazy-8 is arrested when one of the Salamanca drug houses is discovered by the local police, leading Nacho to seek Jimmy McGill's legal services to help free him. Jimmy, as Saul Goodman, creates a ploy that draws Hank to see Domingo, and through Saul's machinations, secures Domingo's release by assuring that he will be Hank's CI.\n\nThe fourth-season character [[#Maximino Arciniega|Maximino Arciniega]] shares his name with the actor who portrayed Krazy-8.\n\n====Jack Welker====\nJack Welker (played by [[Michael Bowen (actor)|Michael Bowen]]) is Todd's uncle and the leader of a white supremacist gang. Walter pays Jack to kill Mike's crew after they are arrested, because Walt fears they can identify him as a member of Gus's operation and may enter into plea bargains since the DEA has stopped the payments Gus had arranged for their families. Jack's gang kills nine of Mike's men and their lawyer Dan Wachsberger in three prisons, within two minutes, which prevents any of them from warning the others or law enforcement authorities from adding extra protection.<ref name=\"Gliding Over All\"/> Jack also heads his gang's massacre of Declan's at Lydia's behest after Declan refuses Lydia's request to replace his shoddy meth cook with Todd.<ref name = \"Buried\" />\n\nJack and his crew are later hired by Walter to kill Jesse in exchange for teaching Todd to cook meth one more time. When Walter is lured to the money's location by Jesse, he calls Jack's crew for help, but calls it off when he sees Hank and Gomez are with Jesse. Nonetheless, Jack and his crew arrive and engage in a shootout with Hank and Gomez.<ref name = \"To'hajiilee\">{{cite episode | title = To'hajiilee | episodelink = To'hajiilee | series = Breaking Bad | serieslink = Breaking Bad | credits = [[Michelle MacLaren]] (dir), [[George Mastras]] (wrt) | network = [[AMC (TV channel)|AMC]] | airdate = September 8, 2013 | season = 5 | number = 13}}</ref> Following the shootout, in which Gomez is killed, Jack murders Hank and abducts Jesse (initially to kill him, then to force him to work as an enslaved meth cook). Jack then orders the gang to dig up Walt's barrels of money (containing approximately $80 million), but at Todd's behest he leaves Walt alive with one barrel (about $11 million).<ref name=\"Ozymandias\"/>\n\nWhen Walter arrives at his hideout and remotely activates an M60 machine gun, the massive bullet spray kills Jack's henchmen, except Todd who manages to duck in time (but is strangled by an enraged Jesse), fatally wounding Jack as well as Walter himself. Jack, despite his critical condition, still attempts to leverage Walter's remaining money, but Walter coldly shoots him mid-sentence with his own gun, in the same manner that Jack shot Hank.\n\nJack's gang includes his second-in-command Kenny ([[Kevin Rankin (actor)|Kevin Rankin]]), as well as Frankie (Patrick Sane), Lester ([[Tait Fletcher]]), and Matt (Matthew T. Metzler).\n\n===Jesse's friends and family===\n\n==== Andrea Cantillo ====\nAndrea Cantillo (played by [[Emily Rios]]) is a love interest of Jesse Pinkman's. She is a recovering [[meth]] addict and single mother to a young son named Brock (played by Ian Posada). Jesse meets her at a drug addicts' support group meeting and initially tries to get her to relapse so she will become a customer of his, but he reverses course when he learns she has a young son to care for. He engages in a romantic relationship with her, but ends it when he discovers that the 11-year-old boy who killed his friend \"Combo\" is her younger brother Tomas Cantillo (played by Angelo Martinez). After the break-up, she confronts Jesse at his home about a large sum of money he had left for her at her home. He tells her the money is for her to move out of her bad neighborhood and to help raise her son. Saul continues to deliver money to her, in her new home, on Jesse's behalf. In Season 4, she and Jesse reunite. When Brock is poisoned, Jesse rushes to the hospital and stays there until the doctors notify him that Brock will survive. In Season 5, Walt manipulates Jesse into leaving her, by advising Jesse that he would have to be honest with her about all the crimes he has committed. While Jesse does send them off again, he continues providing for them financially. Later in the season, Andrea is again contacted by Walt in a failed attempt to lure Jesse out of DEA protection. Walter assigns [[Jack Welker|Jack]] to watch over the house in case Jesse makes an appearance. Subsequently, Jack uses her as leverage against Jesse, who is kept prisoner by him and his team to cook meth for them. After Jesse attempts to escape from Jack's gang, [[Todd Alquist|Todd]] shoots and kills Andrea while Jesse is forced to watch.\n\n====Brock Cantillo====\nBrock Cantillo  (played by Ian Posada) is [[Andrea Cantillo|Andrea]]'s eight-year-old son. Andrea is a recovering [[meth]] addict and single mother. Jesse meets her at a drug addicts' [[twelve-step program]] meeting and initially tries to get her to relapse, so she will become his customer, but he reverses course when he meets Brock and realizes she has a young son to care for. Jesse engages in a romantic relationship with Andrea, but ends it when he discovers that the 11-year-old boy who killed his friend \"Combo\" is her younger brother Tomas Cantillo (played by Angelo Martinez); however, Jesse continues to offer financial support to Andrea and Brock.\n\nIn Season 4, Andrea and Jesse reunite. When Brock gets sick, Jesse rushes to the hospital, and warns the doctors about a possible ricin poisoning, then stays there until the doctors notify him that Brock will survive (it turns out that the boy was indeed poisoned, although not with ricin but with [[lily of the valley]]; still, this timely warning put them on the right track). Jesse fears Brock was poisoned by a [[ricin]] cigarette [[Problem Dog|Jesse was carrying]]. Walt tries to convince Jesse that [[Gus Fring|Gus]] poisoned Brock. This manipulation by Walt renews Jesse's loyalty to him rather than to Gus. In the final season's episode \"[[Confessions (Breaking Bad)|Confessions]]\" Jesse suddenly changes his mind about leaving town and assuming a new identity when he realizes Walt poisoned Brock. Jesse then rushes to Walt's house and attempts to burn it down, but is intercepted by [[Hank Schrader|Hank]].\n\nSubsequently, Brock and Andrea are used as leverage against Jesse, who is kept prisoner by [[Todd Alquist|Todd]] and Jack's gang to cook meth for them. After Jesse attempts to escape, Todd shoots and kills Andrea while Jesse is forced to watch. Then Jesse is threatened with Brock's death if he attempts to escape again.\n\nIn ''[[El Camino: A Breaking Bad Movie]]'', Jesse writes a letter to Brock as he prepares to leave for a new life in [[Alaska]] with Brock being the only person he shows any interest in communicating with. After reading the letter, Ed promises to mail it next month when he is in [[Mexico City]], ensuring that Brock will get it and that it cannot be traced back to Jesse in Alaska.\n\n====Jane Margolis====\nJane Margolis (played by [[Krysten Ritter]]) is Jesse's neighbor, landlady, and lover. She is a prolific [[Drawing|drafter]], a skill that she has used to become a tattoo artist despite not having any tattoos. She is also a recovering drug addict. She discovers that Jesse also has a history of drawing, and each is intrigued by the other. They quickly become a couple, and she relapses into drug addiction, introducing Jesse to [[heroin]]. She later phones Walt and threatens to expose him if he refuses to give Jesse his share of money from a major methamphetamine deal with [[Gus Fring]], a deal that Jesse had nearly ruined by his drug use. Her actions work. After Walt drops off Jesse's cut of nearly a half million dollars to his duplex apartment, she and Jesse discuss running away together to [[New Zealand]] to start new lives. They then enter Jesse's bedroom and see the heroin, but instead of throwing it away as they had promised themselves earlier, they get high and fall asleep. That night Walt returns to the apartment and finds the drugged-out couple unconscious in bed. In the process of trying to wake Jesse from his stupor, Walt accidentally turns Jane on her back.  Still asleep, she soon begins to vomit, and Walt silently stands at the bedside watching her choke and then die from [[asphyxiation]]. Series creator Vince Gilligan later explained Walt's motive for allowing Jane to die. In 2013, during a panel discussion about ''Breaking Bad'' in New York City for the [[Film Society of Lincoln Center]], he stated that Walt was afraid that Jane's bad influence would lead Jesse to an early death from a heroin overdose.<ref name=\"Gilligangda\">{{cite web|title=Breaking Bad Q&A: Vince Gilligan|last=Gilligan|first=Vince|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGphF6Aqq9Y|work=Breaking Bad at the Film Society of Lincoln Center|publisher=YouTube|accessdate=August 28, 2013|location=Film Society of Lincoln Center}}</ref>\n\nJane's death manifests significant repercussions throughout the rest of the series, and is largely responsible for Jesse's downward spiral throughout the first half of the [[Breaking Bad (season 3)|third season]], as well as her father [[#Donald Margolis|Donald]]'s deep depression that affects him to the point that he fails in his duties as an air-traffic controller, leading to a mid-air collision between a 737 and a King Air 350 (\"[[ABQ (Breaking Bad)|ABQ]]\"). In the episode \"[[Fly (Breaking Bad)|Fly]]\", while under the influence of sleeping pills, Walt is tormented by his guilt over his inaction towards Jane; he reveals to Jesse that on the same night she died he unknowingly met her father in a bar (only knowing it was him after seeing him in the news following the plane crash), then questions the statistical improbability of that sequence of events, but stops shy of revealing his involvement. Walt finally reveals to Jesse the full measure of his role in Jane's death in the series' ante-penultimate episode, \"[[Ozymandias (Breaking Bad)|Ozymandias]]\", as a final blow after he ordered Jack to kill him, deeming him responsible for Hank's death and for the loss of his fortune.\n\nJane appears in a flashback in ''[[El Camino: A Breaking Bad Movie]]'', reminding Jesse that sometimes the universe takes people towards bad places, and despite her free spirited nature she considers that it is better to make life's important decisions oneself.\n\n==== Brandon Mayhew ====\nBrandon \"Badger\" Mayhew (played by [[Matt Jones (actor)|Matt L. Jones]]) is [[Jesse Pinkman|Jesse]]'s friend. Despite being on probation, Badger still uses drugs. He had a job as a mascot for a bank, advertising on the street. During Season 1, Badger leaves the job to briefly team up with Jesse in order to cook crystal meth. However, disagreements between the two soon occur, and they bitterly part ways. In Season 2, Badger and Jesse reconcile, and he helps clear the meth lab from Jesse's basement and assists in hiding Jesse's RV to avert police suspicion. Walt and Jesse later employ Badger to sell their product, but he is soon arrested, [[Better Call Saul (Breaking Bad)|causing complications]]. Once released, Badger flees New Mexico to lie low in [[California]] for a while. After Badger returns to New Mexico, Jesse takes advantage of him by easily persuading him to start selling for them again. Later, Badger appears at a [[Narcotics Anonymous]] meeting with [[List of Breaking Bad characters#Skinny Pete|Skinny Pete]], informing a group of recovering drug addicts that \"Blue Sky\" ([[Walter White (Breaking Bad)|Walt]] and Jesse's product) is back in town with the intention of finding new buyers. Soon, he and Skinny Pete begin to find the meetings helpful and continue to attend regularly. Badger helps Jesse several more times over the series, and is in attendance at Jesse's house party, which lasted several days. He is also the lead singer for a band with Jesse called Twa\u00fcghtHamm\u00ebr. Badger is a [[science fiction]] fan and discusses an idea for a ''[[Star Trek]]'' script at length in the episode \"[[Blood Money (Breaking Bad)|Blood Money]].\" He and [[Skinny Pete]] help Walt threaten [[#Gretchen and Elliott Schwartz|the Schwartzes]] in the series finale, \"[[Felina (Breaking Bad)|Felina]]\", by holding laser pointers to imitate [[sniper rifle]]s.\n\nBadger, along with Skinny Pete, appear in [[El Camino: A Breaking Bad Movie|''El Camino'']], helping Jesse hide for a night and to distract the police to give time for Jesse to escape. In particular, Badger drives Skinny Pete's car to the Mexico border while letting Jesse take his own car as Skinny Pete claims that \"no self-respecting outlaw would be caught dead in that car.\" Jesse drives Badger's car throughout the remainder of the movie until he is taken by Ed to [[Alaska]] to start a new life.\n\n====Skinny Pete==== \nSkinny Pete, real name Peter (played by [[Charles Baker (actor)|Charles Baker]]), is Jesse's friend. He served time in prison with Tuco and introduces him to Jesse. Jesse recruits Skinny Pete to deal meth, although Pete is on probation. When Pete is mugged by two addicts, Jesse is forced to get the money and product back. After Badger is arrested and Combo is killed, Pete quits dealing for Jesse, fearing being sent back to prison and for his own safety. He decides to sell meth for Jesse again, albeit on a smaller scale. He attends [[Narcotics Anonymous]] meetings with Badger. After following the program together and staying clean, they relapse when Jesse tempts them with meth. After a few days of heavy meth use they leave Jesse's house. In the [[Breaking Bad (season 5)|Season 5]] episode \"[[Hazard Pay]],\" Skinny Pete is shown to be a talented pianist as he plays a small section of [[C.P.E. Bach]]'s ''[[Solfeggietto]]'' at a music store.<ref>{{youtube|d3dzOf8IXFQ|'Breaking Bad' Star Charles Baker on Working With Bryan Cranston}}</ref> He is also seen in the mid-season premiere \"[[Blood Money (Breaking Bad)|Blood Money]],\" hanging out at Jesse's house and listening to Badger's ''[[Star Trek]]'' script.\n\nSkinny Pete is seen briefly in the series finale, having been hired by Walt (along with Badger) to use [[laser pointer]]s to imitate [[sniper rifle]]s when Walt threatens Gretchen and Elliot should they decide to not take his money and give it to his children. The two are also the ones who tell Walt that indeed his trademark blue meth is still circulating, as pure as when he was producing it with Jesse, meaning that Jesse is still alive, something Walt did not know.\n\nPete, along with Badger, appears in ''El Camino'', helping Jesse hide for a night and attempt to get rid of Todd Alquist's car. When the Lo-Jack is activated on the car, Pete has Badger take Pete's car to the Mexico border, the opposite direction Jesse is traveling in. At the same time, Pete takes the El Camino and Jesse takes Badger's car which Pete says no self-respecting outlaw would be caught dead in. Pete explains that he'll tell the police that Jesse came to him for help and they traded pink slips on their cars, explaining why Pete now has the El Camino. Pete gives Jesse his trademark hat to help him avoid detection, and when Jesse asks why he's helping, he says Jesse is his hero but it is hinted he is driven by guilt over taking Walter White's money in Felina <!-- Maybe the episode title should go in a footnote. -->. Pete is last seen in the film moving the El Camino to his driveway to await the arrival of the police.\n\nBefore the release of ''El Camino'', [[Netflix]] dropped a teaser trailer of the DEA interrogating Pete on Jesse's whereabouts. Though it was not used in the film, several critics speculated after the premiere that the scene likely occurred after Skinny Pete parted ways with Jesse, making this his final chronological appearance.<ref name=\"rs recap\">{{cite web |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/tv/tv-recaps/el-camino-breaking-bad-movie-recap-895354/ |title=\u2018El Camino: A Breaking Bad Movie\u2019 Recap: Jesse Pinkman Is Born Again |last=Sepinwall |first=Alan |date=October 12, 2019 |website=Rolling Stone |access-date=October 17, 2019}}</ref>\n\n==== Christian Ortega ====\nChristian \"Combo\" Ortega (played by Rodney Rush) is Jesse's friend and a dealer of Jesse's methamphetamine. He is also revealed to have been the one who originally owned the RV that Walt and Jesse cooked meth in, which Combo had sold to Jesse for $1,400 without his family's knowledge, which provides a big clue for Hank when tracking down \"Heisenberg.\"\n\nCombo is later killed in \"[[Mandala (Breaking Bad)|Mandala]]\" when a rival drug group corners him while he is dealing methamphetamine on \"foreign turf.\" Combo calls his friend Skinny Pete to report two men are \"mad eyeballing\" him. As he hangs up the phone, a kid on a bicycle shoots him several times, killing him on the street. Combo's death drives Jesse to spiral into drug addiction. Jesse eventually learns that the kid is Tomas Cantillo, the little brother of his new girlfriend Andrea and that Combo was murdered as part of a [[Initiation|gang initiation]]. Jesse subsequently seeks retribution upon the dealers for Combo's murder and the murder of Tomas, putting him at odds with Gus Fring.\n\n====Adam and Diane Pinkman====\nAdam Pinkman (played by Michael Bofshever) and Diane Pinkman (played by [[Tess Harper]]) are Jesse Pinkman's parents. Due to Jesse's drug abuse, they have a strained relationship with their son, which results in them kicking him out of his late aunt's house, where Jesse had been living after serving as his aunt's caretaker and friend. Adam and Diane renovate the home, preparing it for sale. Unbeknownst to them, Jesse works with Saul Goodman to reacquire the home. Claiming to represent an anonymous buyer, Saul presents an offer significantly under market value.  Offended, the Pinkmans begin to leave the negotiating table. As they are leaving, Saul mentions that the home used to host a meth lab, which is not revealed as required in the property [[Convention of disclosure|disclosures]].  Realizing that the home price will plummet and they may be sued, Adam and Diane Pinkman reluctantly accept Saul's offer.\n\nOn the closing date, Jesse visits his parents at the newly renovated home. When Jesse heads to the front door, Diane tells Jesse that the house has been sold, and that he needs to leave, as the new owners will be stopping by shortly. When Jesse does not stop, a confused Mrs. Pinkman asks where he is going. Jesse reveals that he is the new owner.\n\nThe Pinkmans appear in ''El Camino'', requesting in a news interview that Jesse turn himself in. Knowing his parents are probably being monitored by the police, Jesse calls, indicates a willingness to turn himself in, and asks them to pick him up.  Before hanging up, Jesse tells his parents they did their best when raising him, and the life he has led and the problems he has caused are his fault, not theirs.  After his parents leave, Jesse's call is revealed to be a ruse to draw them and police away from the house.  Jesse enters unobserved and recovers two handguns from his parents' safe, a [[Colt Woodsman]] and an [[Iver Johnson#Safety automatic hammerless|Iver Johnson Hammerless]].<ref>{{cite news |last=Eger |first=Chris |date=October 14, 2019 |title=Jesse Pinkman is Back: The Curious Guns of El Camino |url=https://www.guns.com/news/2019/10/14/jesse-pinkman-is-back-the-curious-guns-of-el-camino |work=Guns.com |location=Burnsville, MN}}</ref>\n\n====Jake Pinkman====\nJake Pinkman (played by Ben Petry) is Jesse's younger, over-achieving brother. Jesse accepts the blame for a joint belonging to Jake, which results in Jesse being thrown out of his parents' house. After apologizing to his brother, Jake asks for his joint back; Jesse responds by crushing it on the sidewalk and informing his brother that the marijuana is of poor quality anyway.\n\nIn ''El Camino'', when Jesse calls his parents he asks about Jake, and they tell Jesse that Jake is attending a band camp in [[London]].  When Jesse attempts to open his parents' safe, he correctly guesses that the combination corresponds to Jake's birthday.\n\n====Wendy====\nWendy (portrayed by Julia Minesci) is a meth-addicted street prostitute, who associates with Jesse Pinkman and is featured in the online promotional material as one of Saul Goodman's clients (as \"Wendy S.\"). She helps Jesse maintain an alibi and withstands an intense interrogation from Hank Schrader on Jesse's behalf. Recognizing her loyalty to him, Jesse tries to convince her to help him kill two drug dealers who convinced an 11-year-old boy to murder Combo on Gus's orders. She declines at first, fearing the repercussions, revealing that she has a son whom she needs to protect, but Jesse persuades her to help by drawing a comparison between the murdered boy and her own son. At the last moment, she is spared the ordeal by Mike, who intervenes to take Jesse to a meeting with the drug dealers.\n\nShe is the central character in the cold open of \u201c[[Half Measures]]\u201d where her name is a pun on the song \u201c[[Windy (The Association)|Windy]]\u201d by [[The Association]], which plays in the background.\n\n===Associates of Saul Goodman===\n==== Ernesto ====\nErnesto (portrayed by Brandon K.

Hired more for his size and [[pickpocket]]ing skills than his intelligence, he has a condition approximating [[narcolepsy]] (e.g., he falls asleep at odd times, such as when standing up or while on security detail), and has digestive problems that keep him from being as stoic as Saul would like.<ref>{{cite news|author=Breaking Bad Roundtable|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2013/08/-em-breaking-bad-em-was-jesses-big-epiphany-believable/279017/|date=August 25, 2013|work=The Atlantic|title=Breaking Bad: Was Jesse's Big Epiphany Believable?

Our roundtable discusses \"Confessions,\" the third episode in the AMC show's final half-season.}}</ref> Jimmy McGill hires Huell to plant a cell phone battery in Chuck's pocket as part of Jimmy's defense strategy to discredit Chuck's mental health. Jimmy later hires Huell to serve as a bodyguard while Jimmy conducts his business re-selling pre-paid cellular phones. Huell inadvertently assaults a police officer while protecting Jimmy, and is arrested and faces up to two and a half years in prison as a result. As Jimmy is still disbarred for another month, he brings in Kim Wexler to defend Huell, who plans to jump bail and flee rather than go to prison. To get Huell out of trouble, Jimmy and Kim pull a con on the ADA. The con succeeds in forcing the ADA to accept a plea deal to a lesser misdemeanor, a plea that gets Huell four months probation and time served, ensuring that he does not have to go to prison.\n\nHuell and Kuby were sent to intimidate Ted Beneke into paying his IRS debts with the money Skyler gave him, with no intent of actual violence, but Ted's fall while attempting to flee caused a severe neck injury that resulted in his [[tetraplegia]]. In \"Buried\", Saul sends Huell and Kuby to collect Walt's money from a storage locker, and in \"Confessions\", Saul tasks Huell with pickpocketing Jesse's marijuana so Jesse will not be high when he contacts Saul's \"disappearer\" for a new identity.  It is while Jesse is waiting for the disapperer that he realizes his marijuana is gone and comprehends that Huell had earlier pickpocketed from him the ricin cigarette that Walt had intended for Jesse to use in killing Gus. Jesse's realization that Huell stole the ricin cigarette enables him to understand that Walt must have poisoned Brock in order to turn Jesse against Gus (which turns out to be true, although he did not use the ricin extract for that purpose).\n\nHank and Gomez later interrogate Huell to learn where Walt hid his money, telling him falsely that Walt intends to kill him to ensure that no one can trace Walt's drug-dealing past. They use a staged photo of Jesse, who appears to have been killed with a gunshot to the head, to coax Huell into revealing that he and Kuby packed Walt's money into seven barrels, then loaded the barrels into a rented van. Huell also reveals that the van was so dirty on the outside when Walt returned that they washed it before returning it, implying that Walt's money was buried somewhere in the desert. Hank and Gomez tell Huell to wait until they come back for him, but they are killed and never return, so his fate remains unknown.\n\nDays before the release of ''[[El Camino: A Breaking Bad Movie]]'', a countdown was shared on ''Breaking Bad's'' social media channels. Throughout the countdown, multiple videos were shown of Huell still sitting impatiently in the safehouse, watching the events of \"[[Felina (Breaking Bad)|Felina]]\" on the news.<ref name=\"bustle char\">{{cite web |url=https://www.bustle.com/p/the-el-camino-cast-is-full-of-your-breaking-bad-faves-19198419 |title=The 'El Camino' Cast Is Full Of Your 'Breaking Bad' Faves |last=Gallagher |first=Caitlin |date=October 10, 2019 |website=Bustle |access-date=October 16, 2019}}</ref> Upon the countdown's conclusion, another video was shown of Huell, tired of waiting, putting on his jacket and eventually leaving the safehouse on his own accord as the title credits of ''El Camino'' appear on his television.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.insider.com/breaking-bad-movie-cast-members-who-returned-el-camino-2019-10 |title=12 'Breaking Bad' stars who returned for Netflix's sequel movie 'El Camino' |last=Singh |first=Olivia |date=October 11, 2019 |website=Insider |access-date=October 16, 2019}}</ref>  Though Huell did not appear in the film, it is humorously implied, through this [[breaking the fourth wall]] moment, that the length of time he waited for Hank and Gomez to return was long enough for the film to air.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.theringer.com/movies/2019/10/15/20914631/el-camino-netflix-cameos-ranked-breaking-bad-better-call-saul |title=Ranking the Cameos From 'Breaking Bad' and 'Better Call Saul' in 'El Camino'  |last=McNear |first=Claire |quote=\"One of Breaking Bad fans\u2019 favorite mysteries\u2014did Huell ever make it out of the safe house, given that the guys who were supposed to come get him, Hank and Gomez, were killed before they could?\u2014finally got an answer in a promo for the movie.\" |date=October 15, 2019 |website=[[The Ringer (website)|The Ringer]] |access-date=October 25, 2019}}</ref>\n\n====Ed Galbraith====\nEd Galbraith (played by [[Robert Forster]]) is an associate of Saul Goodman who specializes in providing criminals new identities and new places to live. His legitimate side business is as a vacuum salesman and repairman. Ed helps Saul escape to [[Omaha, Nebraska]].<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/live-feed/better-call-saul-opening-scene-771227 | work=The Hollywood Reporter | title='Better Call Saul' Opening Scene Explained | date=February 8, 2015}}</ref>\n\nIn \"[[Granite State (Breaking Bad)|Granite State]]\" Ed takes Walter White to [[New Hampshire]], hiding him away in a cabin in a rural area. During Walt's time in hiding, Ed often visits Walt, bringing him supplies and chemotherapy, though he warns that if Walt leaves the location, their business relationship will be over for good. A lonely Walt also takes to paying Ed to spend time with him and play cards.\n\nIn ''El Camino'', Jesse approaches Ed for relocation. Ed demands $125,000 to aid Jesse, plus $125,000 for the previous occasion Jesse was supposed to use his services, but failed to appear (depicted in the ''Breaking Bad'' episode \"[[Confessions (Breaking Bad)|Confessions]]\"). Jesse is $1,800 short and Ed refuses to help. After Jesse obtains the money, Ed smuggles him to a car parked near [[Haines, Alaska]] and provides him with false identification documents and a cover story. Jesse gives Ed a farewell letter for Brock Cantillo, which Ed promises to mail from [[Mexico City]] in the near future, wishing Jesse luck on his new life and noting that not many people like them get a fresh start.\n\nIn ''[[Better Call Saul]]'', in the flashforward at the beginning of [[Better Call Saul (season 5)|season 5's]] \"Magic Man,\" (presumably set after the events of ''El Camino'') Saul calls Ed for a second extraction after a cab driver named Jeff recognizes him. Ed recognizes Saul and agrees to a second extraction, warning that it will cost him double. Saul agrees and Ed sets the extraction at 7:00am on Thursday at the same place he dropped Saul off. After a moment of consideration, Saul changes his mind and tells Ed that he will \"fix it myself\" instead.\n\nRobert Forster's appearances as Ed in ''El Camino'' and ''Better Call Saul'' was his final role.  He died of [[brain cancer]] on October 11, 2019, the same day the movie was released, though he appeared in ''Better Call Saul'' as Ed posthumously. Ed is one of only two characters to appear in ''[[Breaking Bad]]'', ''[[Better Call Saul]]'', and ''[[El Camino: A Breaking Bad Movie|El Camino]]'', along with [[Mike Ehrmantraut]]. The ''Better Call Saul'' episode \"Magic Man\" was dedicated to Robert Forster.\n\n====Francesca Liddy====\nFrancesca Liddy (played by [[Tina Parker]]) is Saul Goodman's outspoken receptionist and secretary. Originally hired at the Wexler-McGill law firm, she continued to work for Jimmy when he re-branded himself as Saul.\n\n==== {{anchor|Kuby}}Patrick Kuby ====\nPatrick Kuby (played by [[Bill Burr]]) is one of Saul Goodman's hired hands. He assists in facilitating the [[Open House (Breaking Bad)|car wash sale]] to the Whites by impersonating an environmental inspector, and later [[Crawl Space (Breaking Bad)|intimidates Ted Beneke]] with Huell's help. He also aids Walt, Jesse, and Mike in their [[Dead Freight|train robbery]] and helps Huell [[Buried (Breaking Bad)|collect Walt's money from storage]].

When Walt had to leave class to vomit (a consequence of his chemotherapy), Hugo comforted him and cleaned up after him. After the DEA connects missing school equipment to methamphetamine production, Hugo is one of the initial suspects because of the access his custodial duties afford him. Hugo is soon placed under arrest for possession of marijuana and fired; after a search of his home, more marijuana is found but no methamphetamine or items that could connect him with the meth investigation.\n\n==== Ted Beneke ====\nTed Beneke (played by [[Christopher Cousins]]) is the president and owner of Beneke Fabricators. He gives Skyler back her old job back as his accountant during the second season. Ted has always been attracted to Skyler but does not make any advances after she returns. Ted commits [[tax fraud]] to keep the company alive and save everyone's jobs, which he admits to Skyler when she finds irregularities in the company's books. Skyler has an affair with Ted in season three to exact revenge against Walt, but ignores Ted's offer to leave some of her things at his house. When Walt finds out about their affair, he tries to confront Ted, who hides in his office. This escalates into a scene where Walt is escorted out by security guards and the company staff becomes aware of Skyler's relationship with Ted. Skyler gets angry at Ted when he shows up at her house to ask about their relationship, and she later severs both her personal and professional ties with him.\n\nIn season 4, Ted meets with Skyler, who is now running a car wash, and notifies her of an [[Internal Revenue Service]] (IRS) investigation into his company's taxes.<ref name=\"IGN\">{{cite news |date=July 18, 2012 |title=Breaking Bad Wiki Guide: Ted Beneke |url=https://www.ign.com/wikis/breaking-bad/Ted_Beneke |work=IGN |location=San Francisco, CA}}</ref> Since Skyler kept the books, she can be linked to Ted's tax fraud, likely placing her entire family under surveillance, so she intervenes by pretending at Ted's meeting with the IRS to be an unqualified bookkeeper hired only for her looks.<ref name=\"IGN\" />  Her supposed incompetence forestalls a full investigation, provided Ted pays the back taxes and penalties.<ref name=\"IGN\" />  Skyler arranges to provide Ted the money by using the proceeds from Walt's meth production to have Saul pretend a long-lost dead relative in Luxembourg left Ted an inheritance.<ref name=\"IGN\" />  Saul discovers that instead of paying the IRS, Ted leased a new Mercedes and is using the funds to reopen his business.<ref name=\"IGN\" />  When Skyler urges Ted to pay the IRS first, he refuses, so Skyler tells him the money came from her.<ref name=\"IGN\" />  Ted still refuses to pay the IRS and Skyler perceives him to be blackmailing her into paying both his tax bill and the costs to reopen his business.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.amc.com/shows/breaking-bad/cast-crew/ted-beneke |title=Character Biography: Ted Beneke |website=Breaking Bad Cast and Crew |publisher=[[AMC (TV channel)|AMC.com]] |location=New York, NY |access-date=November 9, 2019}}</ref> Skyler has Saul send two of his men\u2014[[List of Breaking Bad characters#Huell|Huell]] and [[List of Breaking Bad characters#Kuby|Kuby]]\u2014to force Beneke to write the check to the IRS.<ref name=\"IGN\" />  They succeed, but Ted panics and attempts to flee, tripping on a loose rug and crashing headfirst into a counter.<ref name=\"IGN\" />\n\nAt the start of the fifth season, Saul informs Skyler that something happened to Ted, causing her to conclude that he died.

When Jesse's RV quits running, Clovis charges him an exorbitant amount to tow and store the vehicle, due to its cargo. Clovis repairs the RV and catches Jesse sleeping in it after Jesse has scaled the fence (and destroyed a portable toilet in the process) after being evicted from his home. Clovis orders Jesse to pay for the repairs and property damage and then threatens to sell off Jesse's inventory to cover the repairs, when Jesse claims he cannot furnish immediate payment. Jesse again breaks into the gated lot and drives through the gate without paying for the repairs. He later returns to pay Clovis for the repairs and damages and arranges to store the RV inside Clovis' gated lot for $500 per week. Clovis later sells Jesse a used red [[Toyota Tercel]] hatchback. Jesse decides to retrieve the RV, but Walter has warned Clovis that the DEA is looking for it, forcing Clovis to bring it to a junkyard to be destroyed.\n\n==== Louis Corbett ====\nLouis Corbett (played by Kyle Swimmer and [[Caleb Landry Jones]]) is Walt Jr.'s best friend. They both attend JP Wynne High School. He frequently gives Walt Jr. rides to school and helps him set up a PayPal account for donations to Walt Jr.'s website.\n\n==== Dr. Delcavoli ====\nDr. Delcavoli (played by David House) is Walt's physician during the first two seasons. He is said to be one of the top 10 [[Oncology|oncologists]] in the United States.\n\n==== Stacey Ehrmantraut ====\nStacey Ehrmantraut (portrayed by [[Kerry Condon]]) is Mike Ehrmantraut's widowed daughter-in-law and the mother of Kaylee; Mike's granddaughter.<ref>{{cite web |title='I didn't watch Breaking Bad': says Irish actress Kerry Condon starring in spin-off Better Call Saul |url=https://www.independent.ie/entertainment/television/tv-news/i-didnt-watch-breaking-bad-says-irish-actress-kerry-condon-starring-in-spin-off-better-call-saul-31177467.html |website=[[The Independent]] |accessdate=29 February 2020 |language=en |date=April 28, 2015}}</ref>\n\n==== Old Joe ====\nOld Joe (played by [[Larry Hankin]]) is the owner of a local junkyard. He aids Walt and Jesse on several occasions by using his car crusher in addition to sharing his knowledge of the legal limits on police procedure and evidence gathering. He also provides the magnet system used to wipe the evidence from Gus's laptop, and constructs the portable laboratory equipment used in the Vamonos Pest undercover meth lab operation. In ''[[El Camino: A Breaking Bad Movie]]'', Jesse contacts him in order to get rid of Todd's El Camino, which Joe agrees to do for free. However, Joe discovers that the police just activated the LoJack GPS tracker, causing him to flee, while advising Jesse, Skinny Pete and Badger to do the same thing.\n\n==== Group Leader ====\nThe Group Leader (played by [[Jere Burns]]) is a counselor who leads group therapy sessions at Narcotics Anonymous. His actual name is not revealed. He takes a calm, non-judgmental approach to leading discussions and emphasizes that those attending his sessions are there not to improve themselves, but to learn self-acceptance. During an outdoor session at a campfire, he reveals to Jesse and other recovering addicts that in July 1992, while drunk on vodka and high on cocaine, he killed his six-year-old daughter by accidentally hitting her with his car. Jesse, still reeling from Jane's death, asks the Group Leader how can he not hate himself for what happened. The Group Leader responds that self-hatred and guilt stand in the way of achieving true change. The Group Leader is seen again in Season 4, when Jesse returns to a session distraught about killing Gale. During the session, Jesse breaks down and yells at the Group Leader, claiming that his philosophy about \"accepting yourself\" for making mistakes is wrong and people should be judged for the things they have done. Jesse then asks the Group Leader if he just accepts himself for killing his daughter and admits to the whole group that the only reason he comes to these meetings in the first place is to sell meth to them. He asks the Group Leader if he is okay with that, to which the group leader responds, \"No.\" Jesse retorts, \"About time,\" and leaves the session, never to return.\n\n==== Lawson ====\nLawson (played by [[Jim Beaver]]) is Walter White and Mike Ehrmantraut's gun dealer. He sold Walt a .38 caliber snub handgun (a [[Ruger LCR]]) with the serial number filed off,<ref name=\"Thirty-Eight Snub\">{{cite episode | title = Thirty-Eight Snub | episodelink = Thirty-Eight Snub | series = Breaking Bad | serieslink = Breaking Bad | credits = [[Michelle MacLaren]] (dir), [[George Mastras]] (wrt) | network = [[AMC (TV channel)|AMC]] | airdate = July 24, 2011 | season = 4 | number = 2}}</ref> and previously a sniper rifle which Mike intends to use in assassinating Don Hector Salamanca at a remote desert location. Walt purchases an [[M60 machine gun]] from Lawson in the restroom of a Denny's. After the purchase he gives Walt the keys to the car that has the M60 hidden in the trunk.<ref name=\"Live Free or Die\" />\n\n==== Donald Margolis ====\nDonald Margolis (played by [[John de Lancie]]) is [[Jane Margolis (Breaking Bad)|Jane]]'s father. He owns the building his daughter managed for him. He sent Jane to rehab once before and goes with her to recovery meetings. Donald becomes furious when he discovers that his daughter is back on heroin, suspecting Jesse is at fault (in fact, it is the other way around; she initiated Jesse to heroin, although they are both enabling each other). He nearly calls the police but relents when Jane promises to go back into rehab. Depressed, he goes to a bar and strikes up a conversation with a stranger about the heartache of raising children\u2014that stranger turns out to be Walter White, who has recently been blackmailed by Donald's daughter Jane, although he does not realize the coincidence at the moment. Donald's words inspire Walter to help Jesse get clean from heroin. Walt returns to Jesse's apartment and witnesses Jane choking to death on her vomit while intoxicated on heroin. Heartbroken, Donald is present when the [[paramedic]]s remove Jane's body and hardly reacts to Jesse's presence. A month later, he returns to work as an [[air traffic controller]] while still distraught and causes a mid-air collision of two airplanes just above Albuquerque. The collision kills 167 people\u2014which explains the recurring images in the Season 2 flash-forwards of a burned pink teddy bear floating in Walter's pool. Shortly after the incident, Walter hears via his in-car radio that Margolis is rushed to the hospital after a self-inflicted gunshot wound; however, Walt turns the radio off before Margolis' fate is revealed. Later on, in the episode \"[[Fly (Breaking Bad)|Fly]]\", Walter recalls that unlikely sequence of events, telling Jesse about the encounter at the bar (he only realized that this man was Jane's father after he saw him on the news following the disaster), and wonders about the possible meaning of the coincidence.\n\n==== Carmen Molina ====\nCarmen Molina (played by [[Carmen Serano]]) is the assistant principal at JP Wynne High School, where Walt teaches and which Walt Jr. attends. In Season 3, Walt makes an awkward pass at her (as an attempt at \"revenge\" for Skyler's infidelity with Ted), resulting in him being placed on an indefinite sabbatical.<ref name=\"Green Light\">{{cite episode | title = Green Light | episodelink = | series = Breaking Bad | serieslink = Breaking Bad | credits = [[Scott Winant]] (dir), [[Sam Catlin]] (wrt) | network = [[AMC (TV channel)|AMC]] | airdate = April 11, 2010 | season = 3 | number = 4}}</ref> In Season 5, she has been promoted to principal.<ref name=\"Granite State\">{{cite episode | title = Granite State | episodelink = Granite State (Breaking Bad) | series = Breaking Bad | serieslink = Breaking Bad | credits = [[Peter Gould (writer)|Peter Gould]] (dir, wrt) | network = [[AMC (TV channel)|AMC]] | airdate = September 22, 2013 | season = 5 | number = 15}}</ref>\n\n==== Pamela ====\nPamela (played by Julie Dretzin) is a divorce attorney hired by Skyler in the third season. Skyler confides in Pamela that Walter is a drug dealer, and Pamela urges her to contact the police.\n\n==== Gretchen and Elliott Schwartz ====\nGretchen Schwartz (played by [[Jessica Hecht]]) is Walt's former college chemistry assistant and now co-owner of Gray Matter, a successful [[pharmaceutical]] company. A former romantic interest of Walter's, she is married to Walter's former partner and friend, Elliott Schwartz (played by [[Adam Godley]]), who created Gray Matter alongside Walt. Gretchen discovers that Walter lied to his family, having told them she and Elliott are paying for his treatment, and is horrified when Walter angrily and bitterly blames her and Elliott for ruining his life. Although she claims that Walter sees it wrong, what actually transpired remains unknown except that Walter left her and his research behind suddenly and without explanation after Gretchen took him to her parents' home for the weekend. Out of pity for Walter, Gretchen later covers for him and states that she did help Walter out on the condition that she would deny it if asked by Skyler. She also adds that the two will no longer be able to continue to \"fund\" Walt's treatment. When told this, Walter spins another lie in which he claims that he met with Gretchen and learned that she and Elliott have gone broke due to the recession, and hence cut off their financial help. Later, after Skyler's suspicions of Walter having an affair with Gretchen are renewed, Skyler makes contact with Gretchen, who tells her they never paid for any of Walter's medical bills.\n\nIn the penultimate episode \"[[Granite State (Breaking Bad)|Granite State]]\", she is seen with Elliott on ''[[Charlie Rose (TV series)|Charlie Rose]]''. Walter sees the interview at a secluded bar in New Hampshire immediately after calling the DEA to turn himself in. Rose questions them about their association with Walter White, who is now tracked as a criminal. Elliott insists that Walter had nothing to do with the development of Gray Matter, aside from the name. Gretchen adds that the Walter White she knew, not \"Heisenberg,\" is gone. Walter, quietly furious while watching the interview, leaves the bar before the police arrive.\n\nIn the series' last episode, \"Felina,\" Walter forces Gretchen and Elliott to give the remainder of his money to Walt Jr. as a donation from their foundation, warning that two hitmen will kill them if they do not give the money to his son (using Badger and Skinny Pete to hold [[laser pointer]]s at them from outside, as if they were snipers training [[List of laser applications#Laser sight|laser sights]] on them).\n\n==== Rich Schweikart ====\nRichard Schweikart (played by [[Dennis Boutsikaris]]) is the co-founder of the Schweikart & Cokely law firm and Kim's boss.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.telegram.com/entertainment/20180910/jimmy-goes-gangster-as-better-call-saul-takes-breather |title=Jimmy Goes Gangster as Better Call Saul Takes a Breather |last=Guide |first=T.

In the opening scenes, Drew is on his motorcycle riding around the desert scrub. He finds a tarantula, which he places in a jar; he then hears a train coming down the tracks and sets off to see it, only to encounter [[Walter White (Breaking Bad)|Walter White]], [[Jesse Pinkman]], and [[Todd Alquist]] as they are celebrating their success in stealing the methylamine from the tanker car on the train [[List of Breaking Bad characters#Kuby|Kuby]] helped them stop. Walt, Jesse, and Todd turn off the engine to their pump and discover Drew and his motorcycle on the other side of the trestle. They wave hello to Drew, but Todd then pulls out his pistol and kills Drew in cold blood, to Jesse's  dismay.<ref name=\"Dead Freight\">{{cite episode | title = Dead Freight | episodelink = Dead Freight | series = Breaking Bad | serieslink = Breaking Bad | credits = [[George Mastras]] (dir, wrt) | network = [[AMC (TV channel)|AMC]] | airdate = August 12, 2012 | season = 5 | number = 5}}</ref>\n\nDrew's body and motorcycle are hauled back to Vamonos Pest in [[Albuquerque]], where Walter, Mike and Jesse dispose of them, once again using [[hydrofluoric acid]]. Todd keeps the tarantula in the jar. Later on in that episode, [[KOB]] Reporter Antoinette Antonio reports on the disappearance of Drew Sharp and how the search for Drew has now expanded beyond McKinley County.<ref name=\"Buyout\" /> The killing of Drew is a critical turning point for Jesse, who ultimately severs his ties with Walter's operation due to his horror and grief at the young boy's death. After Walter belatedly leaves Jesse his share of the buyout money, Jesse seeks [[Saul Goodman (Breaking Bad)|Saul Goodman]]'s help to send half of the $5 million to Drew's family, but is rebuffed as such a move would draw the attention of the authorities.<ref name=\"Blood Money\">{{cite episode | title = Blood Money | episodelink = Blood Money (Breaking Bad) | series = Breaking Bad | serieslink = Breaking Bad | credits = [[Bryan Cranston]] (dir), [[Peter Gould (writer)|Peter Gould]] (wrt) | network = [[AMC (TV channel)|AMC]] | airdate = August 11, 2013 | season = 5 | number = 9}}</ref> The murder of Drew is mentioned in the tape Hank and Gomez make of Jesse confessing to his and Walter's criminal history.\n\nIn ''[[El Camino: A Breaking Bad Movie]]'', it is revealed that Todd kept the tarantula at his apartment.\n\n==== Spooge ====\nSpooge (played by [[David Ury]]) is a drug addict who steals meth from Skinny Pete at knifepoint.<ref name=\"Breakage\">{{Cite episode |title=Breakage |series=Breaking Bad |network=[[AMC (TV channel)|AMC]] |season=2 |number=5 |serieslink=Breaking Bad |credits=[[Johan Renck]] (dir), [[Moira Walley-Beckett]] (wrt) |airdate=April 5, 2009}}</ref> Jesse later accosts Spooge in the latter's home as Jesse attempts to retrieve the stolen drugs or cash payment. Spooge attempts to repay Jesse by breaking open an ATM he has stolen from a convenience store. While attempting to drill into the machine from the bottom, he begins verbally abusing his girlfriend (played by [[Dale Dickey]]), who tips the ATM, crushing Spooge's head and killing him instantly. (For a short period, Jesse's associates and rivals attribute Spooge's death to Jesse, which strengthens his street credibility and reputation of ruthlessness, until the woman confesses to the murder.) Spooge had a son, whose neglect disturbs Jesse as he realizes the dreadful side effects of the drug business. Before leaving he calls 911 and leaves the phone line open to allow the police to trace the call, making sure that the boy will be taken care of, and instructs the boy not to go back inside the house.<ref name=\"Peekaboo\">{{Cite episode |title=Peekaboo |series=Breaking Bad |network=[[AMC (TV channel)|AMC]] |season=2 |number=6 |serieslink=Breaking Bad |credits=[[Peter Medak]] (dir), [[Vince Gilligan]], [[J.

Walt is not present for his daughter's birth because he is preoccupied with drug-related business, and he blames Jesse for making him miss the birth. Ted Beneke, Skyler's boss, takes Skyler to the hospital when she goes into labor. Skyler brings the baby on her trip to the [[Four Corners Monument]]. Holly is seen learning to walk in Season 5. Holly and her brother spend three months in the home of their Aunt Marie and Uncle Hank while their parents work to determine the state of their marriage. After her Uncle Hank's unexpected death, which causes a nasty fight between Walter and Skyler, Walter kidnaps Holly to \"punish\" Skyler for attempting to stab him, but later has second thoughts and leaves her at a fire station. She is later returned safely to Skyler. Holly's last appearance occurs in \"Felina\" where Walter, via a request that is granted by Skyler, holds and embraces her for a moment before he leaves.\n\n==== Bogdan Wolynetz ====\nBogdan Wolynetz (played by [[Marius Stan (actor)|Marius Stan]]) is the owner and proprietor of the [[car wash]] at which Walt is employed at the beginning of the series. He is abrasive and rude to Walter, who finds this job degrading and tedious. After Walt is diagnosed with lung cancer in the pilot episode, he angrily lashes out at Bogdan and quits.\n\nBogdan does not reappear until the third season, when Walt and Skyler are trying to purchase the car wash in order to launder Walt's drug money. When Skyler is trying to negotiate the purchase, Bogdan brings up Walt's angry outburst and states that, if Walt wants to purchase the establishment it will cost him $20 million. When Saul suggests that Walt and Skyler could accuse Bogdan of harboring [[Islamic extremism|Islamist]] terrorists in order to force him to sell the car wash, Walt exasperatedly reveals that Bogdan is, in fact, [[Romanians|Romanian]]. Eventually, Walt and Skyler are able to purchase it for $800,000 after Skyler hires [[#Kuby|Kuby]] to perform a fake environmental audit on the car wash.\n\nWhen Bogdan hands the keys to the building over to Walter, he taunts Walter by implying that he needs his \"woman\" to do things for him. Walter, having been riled up by Bogdan, refuses to let him leave with his first American business dollar which had been framed and mounted in his shop. Subsequently, Walter spends that dollar in the vending machine to buy a can of soda.\n\n==== Daniel Wormald ====\nDaniel Wormald (played by [[Mark Proksch]]), who uses the alias \"Pryce\", is a quirky and naive man who works for a pharmaceutical company, and decides to make extra money by selling stolen pills to a drug dealer ([[Nacho Varga]]). He considers hiring three bodyguards, including [[Mike Ehrmantraut]], but Mike disarms one and the other runs away.  When Nacho's payment is $20 short, Mike insists that he pay in full.  Mike reveals to Daniel that he researched Nacho and knows he is conducting deals without the knowledge of his bosses, giving him an incentive to make sure things go smoothly.  After a few successful transactions, Daniel and Mike disagree over the risks Daniel is taking, including showing off with a flashy new [[Hummer]].  He dismisses Mike and deals with Nacho alone, enabling Nacho to learn his real identity.  Nacho breaks into Daniel's house and steals back the money he paid Daniel, along with a valuable baseball card collection.   Daniel calls the police, who find an empty hiding place inside a wall of his home.  To keep Daniel from talking to police, Mike offers to retrieve the baseball cards.  Mike then brokers a deal that has Daniel receive his baseball cards and $10,000 in exchange for the Hummer.  Mike requests that [[Saul Goodman|Jimmy McGill]] represent Daniel when suspicious police attempt to interview him again.  Jimmy convincingly explains away Daniel's hiding place as the location of fetish videos stolen by a jealous lover, including presenting a faked video of Daniel performing the act in question\u2014sitting on pies.  Police end their investigation and when Jimmy brags to [[Kim Wexler]] about his success, she chastises him for fabricating evidence. Nacho later breaks into Daniel's house again to request Daniel's aid in procuring empty capsules that look like [[Hector Salamanca]]'s [[angina]] medication, for which Nacho offers $20,000.  Daniel asks Mike for assistance and Mike refuses, but later reconsiders and takes part in the deal.  Nacho tells Mike his plan is to switch Hector's medication for a placebo in the hopes of inducing a fatal heart attack.  Mike tells Nacho that if Hector dies, Nacho should immediately replace the placebos with the real medication so that the cause of Hector's death will not be obvious.\n\n==== Werner Ziegler ====\nWerner Ziegler (played by [[Rainer Bock]]) is a German construction engineer hired by Gustavo Fring to build his underground methamphetamine laboratory. After vetting by Mike Ehrmantraut, Gus chooses Werner over an overly confident French engineer because of his awareness and frank explanation of the difficulties involved in the construction. When it becomes clear that the job will take longer than anticipated and tempers flare among Werner's crew, Mike arranges an \"[[R&R (military)|R&R]]\" outing to a strip club. Mike and Werner retire to a quiet bar for a personal conversation, but Mike has to return to the strip club to smooth over an altercation, and during his absence Werner drunkenly reveals construction details to other patrons at the bar. Werner later requests a weekend off to visit with his wife, which Mike denies. Werner then escapes by bypassing the security system where his crew and he are quartered. According to the note he left behind, he plans to visit with his wife and then return to finish the work. Mike tracks Werner down at a local spa, but so does [[List of Breaking Bad and Better Call Saul characters#Eduardo \"Lalo\" Salamanca|Eduardo \"Lalo\" Salamanca]], to whom Werner mistakenly reveals construction details before Mike ends the call. Mike asks Gus to let Werner return to work, but Gus understands that through Werner Lalo could learn the secret of the meth lab's construction, so he says he will send men to kill Werner. Mike says he will do it himself and convinces Werner to contact his wife at the airport and send her home. He promises that Werner's death will have an explanation that satisfies the authorities, so that his wife will not wonder what happened to him, and to return Werner's crew to Germany unharmed. Werner tells Mike he wants to take a last walk to look at the stars, and Mike follows and shoots him in the head.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{Breaking Bad}}\n{{Better Call Saul}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Breaking Bad Characters}}\n[[Category:Breaking Bad characters| ]]\n[[Category:Better Call Saul characters| ]]\n[[Category:Lists of American crime television series characters]]\n[[Category:Lists of American drama television series characters]]\n", "text_old": "{{short description|Wikipedia list article}}\n{{Use mdy dates|date=August 2017}}\n{{DISPLAYTITLE:List of ''Breaking Bad'' and ''Better Call Saul'' characters}}\n''[[Breaking Bad]]'' is an [[Television in the United States|American television]] series created by [[Vince Gilligan]] that premiered in 2008.

Knowing nothing about the drug trade, he enlists the aid of his former student, [[#Jesse Pinkman|Jesse Pinkman]], to sell the meth he produces. Walt's scientific knowledge and dedication to quality lead him to produce crystal meth that is purer and more potent than any competitors'. To avoid the tedious collection of pseudoephedrine required for production, Walt devises an alternative chemical process utilizing [[methylamine]], giving his product a distinctive blue color. His crystal meth, which is given the street name \"Blue Sky,\" dominates the market, leading to confrontations with established drug makers and dealers.\n\nWalt is initially squeamish about the use of violence, but gradually comes to see it as a necessity. He also comes to find his new status as a [[drug lord]] psychologically rewarding, leading him to become less and less reluctant to resort to criminal acts such as [[theft]], [[extortion]], [[money laundering]], [[depraved indifference]], and [[murder]]. Walt's descent, [[Macbeth]]-like,<ref name=\"TOM GUALTIERI\">{{cite news|journal=Salon|date=August 10, 2013 |title=Walter White vs. Macbeth|first=Tom|last=Gualtieri|url=http://www.salon.com/2013/08/10/walter_white_vs_macbeth/}}</ref> into the criminal underworld unearths immense levels of deeply repressed ambition, rage, resentment, vanity, and an increasing ruthlessness which alienates him from his family and colleagues.\n\n====Skyler White====\n{{see also|Skyler White}}\n[[File:Anna Gunn by Gage Skidmore 2.jpg|thumb|upright=0.5|Anna Gunn]]\n'''Skyler White''' (n\u00e9e '''Lambert''') (played by [[Anna Gunn]]) is Walter's wife. She has had several meager sources of income: writing short stories, selling items on [[eBay]], working as a bookkeeper, and ultimately helping her husband launder money. Skyler and Walter have a son, Walter Jr., and an infant daughter, Holly. Skyler loves Walter very much, but their marriage becomes increasingly strained due to his unexplained absences and bizarre behavior, ultimately leading to their separation. Later, once Walter reveals his operation, she aids him in laundering his funds. They buy the car wash where Walter had recently moonlighted. Although she helps Walter, she remains displeased with the overall situation. As Walter slowly becomes more of a \"hardened criminal,\" her emotions of fear and worry for him become increasingly prevalent. When in the episode \"Buried,\" Hank tells Skyler he is on to Walt but needs her help to provide sufficient evidence to build a successful case, Skyler replies that she needs a lawyer and later tells Walt they should remain quiet.\n\n====Jesse Pinkman====\n{{see also|Jesse Pinkman}}\n[[File:Aaron Paul by Gage Skidmore 2.jpg|thumb|upright=0.5|Aaron Paul]]\n'''Jesse Bruce Pinkman''' (played by [[Aaron Paul]]) is a small-time methamphetamine user, manufacturer, and dealer. In high school, he was an indifferent student in Walter White's chemistry class. Now in his mid-20s, Jesse is Walt's business partner in the meth trade. Jesse is impulsive, hedonistic, and uneducated beyond high school, but he is financially ambitious and streetwise. He talks in playful slang, likes to wear garish clothing that follows the latest trends in youth culture, plays video games, listens to rap and rock music, takes recreational drugs, and drives [[lowrider]]s. Walt treats Jesse like a foolish son in constant need of stern correction. Jesse's own family kicked him out of their house because of his drug use. Despite the friction between them, he and Walt have a deep bond of loyalty. As a result of his relationship with Walt, Jesse becomes an excellent meth cook, ultimately leading to his exploitation by others. Despite his criminal lifestyle, Jesse is far more conscientious than Walt.  He is horrified, particularly during later seasons, by the brutality at the higher levels of the drug trade, but remains involved with Walt because he is not sure what else he can do. He is very protective of children; his desire to keep children out of the violent drug world gives rise to several key events throughout the series. He wrestles with feelings of guilt about the deaths, all drug-related, of people he has been associated with. Towards the end of the fifth season he is overwhelmed by guilt and his \"blood money.\"  Realizing how much pain he has caused for money leads him to attempt to give bundles of cash from his final payoff to people he knows and then throw them from his car window onto random lawns and porches. In ''[[El Camino: A Breaking Bad Movie]]'', Jesse departs for a new life in [[Alaska]].\n\n====Hank Schrader====\n{{see also|Hank Schrader}}\n[[File:Dean Norris by Gage Skidmore 2.jpg|thumb|upright=0.5|Dean Norris]]\n'''Hank Schrader''' (played by [[Dean Norris]]) is Walt and Skyler's brother-in-law and Marie's husband, who works as a U.S. [[Drug Enforcement Administration]] (DEA) agent. He is involved in investigating a meth dealer known as \"Heisenberg,\" unaware for over a year that his prey is actually Walter. Hank has a cavalier exterior, but in reality the dark side of his job affects him more than he cares to admit. In the course of his work, Hank is promoted to El Paso, Texas from Albuquerque for a short time but experiences a traumatic event and moves back to Albuquerque. Despite his brashness, Hank is highly competent at his job and cares deeply about his family. Hank is eventually promoted to Assistant Special Agent in Charge of the DEA in Albuquerque but is still determined to solve the \"Heisenberg\" case, which ultimately leads to his demise.\n{{clear}}\n\n====Marie Schrader====\n[[File:Betsy Brandt by Gage Skidmore.jpg|thumb|upright=0.5|left|Betsy Brandt]]\n{{Infobox character\n| color = #13613A\n| name = Marie Schrader\n| series = [[Breaking Bad]]\n| image = \n| caption =\n| creator = [[Vince Gilligan]]\n| portrayer = [[Betsy Brandt]]\n| first = \"[[Pilot (Breaking Bad)|Pilot]]\" (2008)\n| last = \"[[Felina (Breaking Bad)|Felina]]\" (2013)\n| occupation = Radiologic Technician at Kleinman Radiology Center\n| spouse = [[#Hank Schrader|Hank Schrader]] \n| children = \n| family = {{Plainlist|\n* [[#Walter White|Walter White]]  (brother-in-law)\n* [[#Skyler White|Skyler White]] (sister)\n* [[#Walter White, Jr.|Walter White, Jr.]] (nephew)\n* [[#Holly White|Holly White]] (niece)\n}}\n}}\n'''Marie Schrader''' (n\u00e9e '''Lambert''') (played by [[Betsy Brandt]]) is Skyler's sister, Hank's wife, and Walt's sister-in-law. Marie works as a [[radiologic technologist]]. She does not hesitate to offer advice to others, but often fails to practice what she preaches. She shoplifts compulsively-apparently a manifest symptom of [[kleptomania]]\u2014a behavior for which she sees a therapist. She appears self-centered and shallow, but is very devoted to her husband and cares deeply for her sister's family. Nearly all of her household and clothing items are shades of the color purple.\n\nIn Season 3, Marie becomes a major source of comfort and support to her husband, when [[#Leonel and Marco Salamanca|The Cousins]] shoot and nearly kill him. With Walt and Skyler's help, she arranges for Hank to undergo an aggressive physical-therapy program their insurance does not cover. When Hank stubbornly decides to stay at the hospital, claiming he is completely disabled, she refuses to give up on him and masturbates him to prove he still has feeling below the waist. When he returns home, however, Hank is cold and brash to Marie, despite her attempts to make him comfortable, and she spirals back into kleptomania. Once Hank starts making progress with the case, his relationship with Marie improves again. When Walt and Skyler have marital problems, she volunteers to take in their children for a couple of days while they work things out.\n\nIn the final season, Hank shares with Marie the truth about Walter's criminal activities, and Marie confronts Skyler. Learning Skyler knew of Walt before Hank was shot, Marie slaps her sister and storms out of the room. She tries to take Holly with her, but Hank commands her to return the baby. She then urges Hank \"to get\" Walter. Marie helps Hank try to stop Walt and Skyler, but their attempts are thwarted when Walt makes a DVD framing Hank. Marie is eager to help Hank when Jesse agrees to confess about Walt's crimes. She is initially unaware of Hank's death and reconciles with Skyler on the condition she tells Walt Jr. everything. Marie learns that Hank is missing when Walt kidnaps Holly, and eventually receives confirmation he is dead. She is last seen in her house two months later, now with blue instead of purple trim around the house, warning Skyler to be on the lookout for Walt.\n\n==== Walter White Jr. ====\n[[File:RJ Mitte by Gage Skidmore 2.jpg|thumb|upright=0.5|left|RJ Mitte]]\n{{Infobox character\n| color = #13613A\n| name = Walter White Jr.\n| series = [[Breaking Bad]]\n| image = \n| caption = \n| full_name = Walter Hartwell White Jr.\n| creator = [[Vince Gilligan]]\n| portrayer = [[RJ Mitte]]\n| first=\"[[Pilot (Breaking Bad)|Pilot]]\" (2008)\n| last=\"[[Felina (Breaking Bad)|Felina]]\" (2013)\n| occupation = Student\n| alias = Flynn\n| children = \n| family = {{Plainlist|\n* [[#Walter White|Walter White]]  (father)\n* [[#Skyler White|Skyler White]] (mother)\n* [[#Marie Schrader|Marie Schrader]] (maternal aunt)\n* [[#Hank Schrader|Hank Schrader]]  (maternal uncle)\n* [[#Holly White|Holly White]] (sister)\n}}\n}}\n'''Walter Hartwell White Jr.''' (played by [[RJ Mitte]]) is Walter and Skyler's teenage son and Holly's older brother.

Angered by his parents' constant fighting, Walter Jr. tries to establish an independent identity, insisting on being called Flynn and asking his best friend Louis to teach him how to drive. When he discovers that Walt has cancer, Walter Jr. changes his attitude and sets up a website, \"www.savewalterwhite.com,\" which requests and collects donations in an effort to help pay for Walt's cancer treatment. Walt's lawyer, [[#Saul Goodman|Saul Goodman]], arranges for a wave of fictional \"donations\" drawn from Walter's drug money, in order to launder it and also make Walter Jr.'s efforts appear successful. When Skyler and Walt separate, Walter Jr., given no explanation by either parent, only sees that his mother has (from his point of view) inexplicably thrown his terminally ill father out of the house, and he takes his father's side and stops answering to the name Flynn. Always being \"late to the game\" (as defined by Mitte on an episode of ''[[Talking Bad]]''), Walter Jr. remains oblivious to his father's drug trade life until \"[[Ozymandias (Breaking Bad)|Ozymandias]],\" when Marie, confident that Walt is in Hank's custody, forces Skyler to reveal the whole truth to her son. Upon learning of his father's connection with Hank's death, Walter Jr. mistakenly concludes that Walt killed Hank. Feeling betrayed Jr. calls [[911 (number)|911]] when Walt fends off Skyler's knife attack, thus forcing Walt to leave and eventually end up on the [[most wanted list]]. In \"[[Granite State (Breaking Bad)|Granite State]],\" Walt attempts to talk to him over the phone and have him retrieve $100,000 that Walt planned to send to Louis' address; however, Walter Jr. angrily refuses and hangs up.

Despite his flamboyant appearance and mannerisms\u2014punctuated by his outrageous low-budget TV commercials\u2014Saul is a highly competent lawyer who is able to solve problems and find loopholes in order to protect his clients. He is also reluctant to be associated with violence or murder.\n\nHis background is explored in ''Better Call Saul'', taking place about six years before ''Breaking Bad''. Jimmy had been arrested in Chicago as a con man, but his older brother Charles \"Chuck\" McGill, a partner in an Albuquerque law firm, freed him of those charges on the condition Jimmy would return with him to find legitimate employment. Jimmy became inspired to enter the legal profession due to Chuck, and though he earned his degree, found that Chuck had conspired behind the scenes to prevent him from finding any type of respectable legal work short of public defense. After Chuck's death and losing his license to practice for a year, Jimmy returned to practice under the \"Saul Goodman\" name, drawing on the criminal clientele he had gained through his side business of selling disposable cell phones over the year before.\n\nBy the time of ''Breaking Bad'', Saul has established an office in a strip mall and advertises across the city. He works with [[#Gustavo Fring|Gus]] and [[#Mike Ehrmantraut|Mike]] to help cover their drug business, and helps introduce [[#Walter White|Walter]] and [[#Jesse Pinkman|Jesse]] to Gus as a potential buyer. Subsequently, he helps Walter and [[#Skyler White|Skyler]] launder the drug money, and provides legal assistance for Jesse and his drug-dealing friends. As fallout between Gus and Walter plays out, and Hank discovers Walter's identity as Heisenberg, Saul uses the \"disappearing\" services of [[#Ed Galbraith|Ed]] to relocate to Omaha, Nebraska under the name Gene Takavic (as shown in flash-forwards in ''Better Call Saul''), where he runs a [[Cinnabon]] store while remaining paranoid that someone may identify him from his past.\n\n====Gus Fring==== <!-- Redirect(s) from: Los Pollos Hermanos -->\n{{see also|Gus Fring}}\n[[File:Giancarlo Esposito by Gage Skidmore.jpg|thumb|upright=0.5|Giancarlo Esposito]]\n'''Gustavo Fring''' (played by [[Giancarlo Esposito]]) is the [[Chile]]an-born proprietor of Los Pollos Hermanos, a highly successful [[fried chicken]] restaurant chain. He is also a public [[boosterism|booster]] for the local DEA office and a member of the hospital board. However, despite outward appearances, Gus is a major drug kingpin initially affiliated with the [[Mexico|Mexican]] drug cartel in Ciudad Ju\u00e1rez, who uses his restaurants as a front for [[methamphetamine]] distribution throughout the [[American southwest]]. Like [[Walter White (Breaking Bad)|Walter White]], Gus is a criminal who \"hides in plain sight,\" using his anti-drug philanthropy to conceal his true nature. Gus originally established Los Pollos Hermanos in Mexico several years previously, but emigrated to the [[United States]] when [[List of Breaking Bad characters#Don Eladio Vuente|Don Eladio]] and [[Hector Salamanca]] murdered his cook and close friend, [[Maximino Arciniega]], as punishment for insulting Eladio. As shown in ''Better Call Saul'', Gus had long sought revenge on Hector for Max's death, and when Nacho causes Hector to have a stroke, Gus uses the opportunity to pay for Hector's recovery but only to a point where Hector has awareness of what is going on and can move his right finger, leaving him otherwise paralyzed to a wheelchair for the rest of his life. Subsequently, through both series, Gus seeks to supply his own source of drugs and eliminate the reliance on the Cartel, building a \"superlab\" underneath an industrial laundromat where large batches of meth can be cooked without discovery. Gus initially has plans for [[#Gale Boetticher|Gale]] to be his cook, but when he discovers the superior quality of Walter's blue meth, he has Walter become his cook, reluctantly allowing Jesse to join him. This leads to a series of confrontations that sees Walter having Jesse kill Gale,  causing the relationship between Gus and Walter fall out while Gus draws in Jesse as an ally. Walter goads Jesse to help lure Gus into a trap to visit Hector at a nursing home. Gus realizes too late it is a trap as Hector sets off Walter's homemade pipe bomb, killing himself and Gus. In the investigation of Gus' death, the police make ties between Gus and Mike's associates, and Walter is forced to kill Mike to keep the authorities off his trail.\n\n====Mike Ehrmantraut====\n{{see also|Mike Ehrmantraut}}\n[[File:Jonathan Banks 2012 2.jpg|thumb|upright=0.5|Jonathan Banks]]\n'''Mike Ehrmantraut''' (played by [[Jonathan Banks]]) is a former [[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania|Philadelphia]] police officer who works for [[Gus Fring|Gus]]\u2014and, on occasion, [[Saul Goodman (Breaking Bad)|Saul]]\u2014as a private investigator, head of security, [[cleaner (crime)|cleaner]], and [[hit man]]. In the ''Better Call Saul'' episode \"[[Gloves Off (Better Call Saul)|Gloves Off]]\", it is implied that Mike is a [[United States Marine Corps|Marine Corps]] veteran of the [[Vietnam War]].  His reasons for leaving the Philadelphia police are never specified during ''Breaking Bad'', but given his story to Walt about missing a chance to kill an abusive perpetrator who eventually murdered a victim Mike was trying to help, and Hank's refusal to bring up the reason for Mike's departure from the police, it is implied that Mike decided to take revenge against the abuser, which resulted in Mike's departure. As a result, one of the lessons Mike employed in his criminal activities was to not take \"half measures.\" The prequel series ''[[Better Call Saul]]'' revealed that Mike, a crooked cop, murdered two other crooked cops who had killed his son Matt, also a police officer, after Matt hesitated to involve himself in corruption. The next day (circa 2002) Mike fled to Albuquerque to be near his granddaughter Kaylee (played by Kaija Roze Bales) and daughter-in-law Stacey.  He initially worked as a parking attendant at the Albuquerque courthouse, where the evening and night hours often enabled him to take part in criminal activities during the day.  Mike is a calm and calculating individual who efficiently performs his duties for Gus, using his extensive knowledge of police procedure to do so without detection. Prior to his murder of [[List of Breaking Bad and Better Call Saul characters#Werner Ziegler|Werner Ziegler]] he is shown to go to extreme lengths to avoid killing anyone or targeting innocent bystanders. Mike makes a cameo in ''[[El Camino: A Breaking Bad Movie]]'' where he and Jesse discuss their plans before quitting the drug business. It is Mike's suggestion of a new life in [[Alaska]] that drives Jesse's ambitions following his escape from Jack Welker's gang.\n\n====Lydia Rodarte-Quayle====\n{{Infobox character\n| color = #13613A\n| name = Lydia Rodarte-Quayle\n| series = [[Breaking Bad]] / [[Better Call Saul]]\n| image = \n| caption =\n| creator = [[Vince Gilligan]]\n| portrayer = [[Laura Fraser]]\n| first = {{Plainlist|\n* '''''Breaking Bad''''':\n* \"[[Madrigal (Breaking Bad)|Madrigal]]\" (2012)\n* '''''Better Call Saul''''':\n* \"[[Off Brand]]\" (2017)\n}}\n| last = {{Plainlist|\n* '''''Breaking Bad''''':\n* ''[[El Camino: A Breaking Bad Movie#Snow Globe: A Breaking Bad Short|Snow Globe]]'' (2020)\n* '''''Better Call Saul''''':\n* \"[[JMM (Better Call Saul)|JMM]]\" (2020)\n}}\n| occupation = {{Plainlist|\n* Executive at Madrigal Electromotive [[GmbH]]\n* Drug smuggler\n}}\n| alias = \n| children = Kiira Rodarte-Quayle (daughter)\n| significant_other = Todd Alquist \n}}\n[[File:Laura_Fraser_discusses_Loch_Ness_with_Moobys.jpg|thumb|left|upright=0.5|Laura Fraser]]\n'''Lydia Rodarte-Quayle''' (played by [[Laura Fraser]]) is an executive of Madrigal Electromotive [[GmbH]], working out of the company's office in [[Houston, Texas]]. She originally worked with [[Gus Fring]] as a supplier of chemicals required for his drug business in the [[American southwest]]. Following his violent death at the hands of Walter, the [[Drug Enforcement Administration|DEA]] begins investigating the link between Gus and Madrigal. Lydia becomes anxious and asks Mike to eliminate 11 people who were involved with Gus and could expose her. When he refuses, Lydia makes the same offer to one of the 11 on her hit list and adds Mike to it. However, Mike ambushes and kills the new hit man, and deduces that Lydia is responsible. He consequently breaks into Lydia's home, ready to execute her, but allows her to live contingent on her providing [[methylamine]] for a new meth operation to be run by Walt, Jesse, and Mike.\n\nAfter Lydia provides the first shipment, the DEA visits Madrigal and Lydia is forced to give up her man in the warehouse to the DEA. When Mike sends Jesse to Houston to pick up the next shipment, he and Lydia find a GPS tracker at the bottom of one of the barrels. Mike guesses that Lydia placed it because she wants out of the business, and again vows to kill her. After bugging Hank's office, they find that the tracker was planted by the DEA's Houston office.  Lydia provides Walt, Jesse, and Mike information about a freight train that includes a tanker car full of methylamine, enabling a 1,000-gallon heist which ensures they can continue cooking meth almost indefinitely. Later, she provides Walt with a new market in the [[Czech Republic]], using her resources and network to distribute the meth in large quantities.\n\nAfter Walt quits, Declan and his gang take over the meth business, but produce a poor quality product. Lydia and Jack's gang arrange the massacre of Declan's crew, after which Jack's gang takes the methylamine and begins running Declan's business, later kidnapping Jesse to cook a better product for them. Months later, during a meeting with Todd, Walt (now a wanted criminal) interrupts a regular coffee shop meeting between Lydia and Todd to offer a new method of meth production. Lydia appears to agree to Walt's offer, but after Walt leaves she suggests to Todd that Walt should be killed at the meeting. That evening Lydia is obviously ill and calls Todd to check on whether the gang killed Walt. Walt answers Todd's phone and tells her that Jack and his gang are all dead and she will soon be dead too, because he added ricin to the [[stevia]] she used in her tea during the meeting at the coffee shop. In the 2019 movie ''[[El Camino: A Breaking Bad Movie]]'', Jesse hears a radio news report that confirms Walt's death and mentions that a woman from Houston, presumably Lydia, is critically ill after having been poisoned.  The report indicates that her suspected ties to Walt are being investigated, and that she is not expected to survive.\n\nLydia reappears in season 3 of ''Better Call Saul''. She is initially revealed to have assisted Gus in acquiring the laundry facility that he will use for the superlab. Later, when Mike decides that he needs Gus to help him clean the money he acquired from robbing one of Hector's trucks, Gus arranges for Lydia to launder it through Madrigal, with Mike receiving $10,000 per week as a contracted security consultant.\n\n====Todd Alquist====\n[[File:Jesse Plemons (20769593584).jpg|thumb|left|upright=0.5|Jesse Plemons]]\n{{Infobox character\n| color = #13613A\n| name = Todd Alquist\n| series = [[Breaking Bad]]\n| image = \n| caption =\n| creator = [[Peter Gould (writer)|Peter Gould]] <br> [[Vince Gilligan]]\n| portrayer = [[Jesse Plemons]]\n| first = \"[[Hazard Pay]]\" (2012)\n| last = ''[[El Camino: A Breaking Bad Movie#Snow Globe: A Breaking Bad Short|Snow Globe]]'' (2020)\n| occupation = {{Plainlist|\n* Pest exterminator for Vamonos Pest\n* [[Methamphetamine|Meth]] manufacturer\n}}\n| alias = \n| children = \n| family = [[#Jack Welker|Jack Welker]] (uncle)\n| significant_other = Lydia Rodarte-Quayle\n}}\n'''Todd Alquist'''<ref name=\"Todd Alquist\">{{cite web |url=http://www.amctv.com/shows/breaking-bad/cast/todd-alquist |title=Todd Alquist |publisher=AMC |accessdate=November 20, 2013}}</ref> (played by [[Jesse Plemons]]) is an exterminator for Vamonos Pest, a [[fumigation]] company used by [[Walter White (Breaking Bad)|Walt]], Mike, and [[Jesse Pinkman|Jesse]] as the [[Front organization|front]] for their meth business after [[Gus Fring]]'s death. Todd and the other Vamonos employees are also burglars, gathering information from the houses they tent and selling it to outside parties. Todd notices and disables a [[nanny cam]] at Walt and Jesse's first post-Gus Fring cook site, attracting their attention to someone they think might be useful in the future. He aids in the heist of [[methylamine]] from a freight train, and gives a friendly wave to a boy who stumbles on the crime scene, but then shoots him without warning. The team reluctantly keeps Todd employed after the murder, accepting his explanation that he assumed there could be no witnesses to the crime or they all risked arrest. Todd's explanation, plus his claims that his uncle runs a gang with connections that could be valuable to the meth operation, convince Walt, Jesse, and Mike to keep him alive.\n\nAfter Jesse and Mike quit, Todd becomes Walt's assistant in the cooking process. Todd respectfully refers to Walter as \"Mr. White\", and after studying under Walt, he spends his breaks going over his notes, but refuses to accept payment until he satisfies Walt's standards. After Walt kills Mike, Todd helps dispose of Mike's car and body, and Walt uses Jack's prison connections to eliminate Gus's nine living former employees and their lawyer to keep them from exposing Walt.\n\nAfter the gang captures Jesse, Todd convinces his uncle to force Jesse to cook for them instead of killing him. Jesse creates a batch with a level of purity comparable to Walt's. Thinking he deserves a reward for a job well done, Todd brings him ice cream and praises him for his skill. Todd's bad side is again on display when he shoots and kills Jesse's ex-girlfriend [[List of Breaking Bad characters#Andrea Cantillo|Andrea]] to punish Jesse for an escape attempt, but he politely apologizes before he shoots her. Months later, Walter kills Jack's gang by remotely firing an [[M60 machine gun]] installed in the trunk of a car. Todd survives, but Jesse strangles him with the chains of his handcuffs, choking him hard enough to snap his neck.\n\nTodd's alternating from charming politeness and respectful gestures to sudden violent acts led his character to be called the most dangerous villain on ''Breaking Bad'', and [[IGN]] named him 2013's best TV villain.<ref name=\"2013Best\">{{cite news|url=http://www.ign.com/wikis/best-of-2013/Best_TV_Villain |title=Best TV Villain \u2013 IGN's Best of 2013 |publisher=[[IGN]]. |accessdate=January 13, 2014}}</ref><ref name=\"Li, Shirley\">{{cite web |author=Li, Shirley |title=Forget Gus: Todd is the most dangerous villain on 'Breaking Bad' |url=http://popwatch.ew.com/2013/09/17/breaking-bad-dangerous-villain-todd/ |work=Entertainment Weekly |date=September 17, 2013 |accessdate=October 5, 2013}}</ref>\n\nIn ''[[El Camino: A Breaking Bad Movie]]'', Todd appears in flashbacks that take place after Jesse's failed escape attempt and Andrea's death. Todd, Kenny, and Neil Kandy torment Jesse as Neil builds his new restraints. Todd later enlists Jesse's help to add a canopy to his El Camino and bury the body of Todd's cleaning lady, whom he murdered after she accidentally found his hidden money.

However, Kim's personal history with Jimmy complicated their working relationship, often putting her at odds with Howard Hamlin and Chuck McGill, threatening her promising career and eventually putting her in Hamlin's doghouse. This forced her to reevaluate her place in HHM and decide to leave, and she set up a practice of her own, sharing office space and expenses with Jimmy, but in separate firms. Despite this, because of their feud, she finds herself still in the middle of the dispute between Chuck and Jimmy.\n{{clear}}\n\n==== Howard Hamlin ====\n{{See also|Howard Hamlin}}\n[[File:Patrick Fabian on the Bellin Run 2011.jpg|thumb|upright=0.5|Patrick Fabian]]\n'''Howard Hamlin''' (portrayed by [[Patrick Fabian]]) is the name partner and general go-to guy toeing the company line for hugely successful Albuquerque law firm Hamlin, Hamlin & McGill. Howard is one of life's winners. His good fortune, sun-kissed looks, and more than ample charm prove to be a constant source of frustration for Jimmy as is his relationship with Chuck McGill.\n\nAfter Chuck steps away from the firm due to his claim of electromagnetic hypersensitivity, Howard covers for him trying to avoid Chuck's condition from being reported to the insurance agency. He always follows Chuck's instructions to keep Jimmy from achieving any type of success in the legal business. After Jimmy doctors the paperwork that Chuck had done for the Mesa Verde bank, costing the firm the client, Chuck secretly records a confession from Jimmy about the doctored papers, and Howard helps Chuck to confirm the account. Chuck presents the evidence to have Jimmy disbarred, but Jimmy uses the opportunity to expose Chuck's supposed hypersensitivity as a psychological aliment. The firms agency discovers this, and demands Howard either terminate Chuck or they will drastically raise their rates. Howard is forced to release Chuck. Due to an argument with Jimmy, Chuck kills himself later the same day, and Howard comes to bear the weight of causing Chuck's death.

He is the right-hand man to Tuco Salamanca, heir to the crime family of the same name. While not yet a kingpin himself, Nacho is bright and has the ear of his terrifying boss. Nacho hires Jimmy as his lawyer after being introduced to him by Tuco at the start of Season 1. He secretly begins working with Mike Ehrmantraut at the end of season 1. He admires Mike's calm and calculated approach, especially when compared to Tuco's impulsive and irrational way of working. After secretly working with Mike to get Tuco sent to prison, Nacho becomes fearful that Tuco's uncle Hector will discover this and harm him or his father, and takes the step of replacing Hector's heart medication with placebos. During a key meeting between Hector and Gus, Hector has a heart attack due to the placebo, and Gus catches Nacho trying to switch back the pills.

A brilliant man who holds himself and others to high ideals, Chuck firmly believes that doing the right thing is the only true path to success. Chuck is critical of Jimmy's background as a scam-artist, considering his brother's attorney status an insult to the law.\n\nChuck believes he suffers from [[electromagnetic hypersensitivity]], an unusual affliction caused by mysterious circumstances, which makes it challenging for him to lead a normal life. He has twice shown no reaction to sources of electromagnetic radiation that were nearby but whose presence he was unaware of, suggesting that he suffers from a mental illness rather than the physical condition he claims.\n\nIn the season 3 finale \"Lantern,\" after suffering a severe relapse of his condition, Chuck commits suicide by intentionally knocking over a lantern, which causes a fatal fire.\n{{clear}}\n\n==== Lalo Salamanca ====\n{{see also|Lalo Salamanca}}\n'''Eduardo \"Lalo\" Salamanca''' (portrayed by [[Tony Dalton]]) is another of Hector's nephews, introduced in season 4 of ''Better Call Saul''.

Lalo visits Hector in the nursing home and gives him the gift of a front desk call bell, which Lalo kept as a souvenir after Hector killed a hotelier and burned down the building after the hotel owner was disrespectful to him.  Lalo attaches the bell to Hector's wheelchair, enabling him to communicate more effectively with his right index finger, the only body part Hector can move after he emerges from his coma.  Lalo thanks Gus for giving Hector first aid and paying for his care, but also surveils Gus's subordinates in order to learn their regular activities. When Werner escapes from Mike's supervision, Lalo becomes aware that Werner was constructing something for Gus, and becomes more suspicious of Gus's intentions with the cartel.\n{{clear}}\n\n==Supporting characters==\n===Cast table===\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\" style=\"width:210px;\" | Character !! style=\"width:150px;\" rowspan=\"2\"| Portrayed by !! colspan=\"6\"| ''[[Breaking Bad]]'' !! colspan=\"5\"| ''[[Better Call Saul]]'' !! rowspan=\"2\" style=\"width:175px;\" | [[El Camino: A Breaking Bad Movie|''El Camino:<br />{{small|A Breaking Bad Movie}}'']]\n|-\n! style=\"width:80px;\"| [[Breaking Bad (season 1)|1]] !! style=\"width:80px;\"| [[Breaking Bad (season 2)|2]] !! style=\"width:80px;\"| [[Breaking Bad (season 3)|3]] !! style=\"width:80px;\"| [[Breaking Bad (season 4)|4]] !! style=\"width:80px;\"| [[Breaking Bad (season 5)#Part 1|5a]] !! style=\"width:80px;\"| [[Breaking Bad (season 5)#Part 2|5b]] !! style=\"width:80px;\"| [[Better Call Saul (season 1)|1]] !! style=\"width:80px;\"| [[Better Call Saul (season 2)|2]] !! style=\"width:80px;\"| [[Better Call Saul (season 3)|3]] !! style=\"width:80px;\"| [[Better Call Saul (season 4)|4]] !! style=\"width:80px;\"| [[Better Call Saul (season 5)|5]]\n|-\n!

He is knowledgeable about the inner workings of Mexican gangs. He does not seem to mind Hank's off-color remarks about his ethnicity. Gomez, or \"Gomey\" as Hank affectionately calls him, is promoted to El Paso after Hank witnesses a deadly attack on the Mexican border. (Afraid of going back to the deadly environment there, Hank delayed his transfer.) Gomez has been Hank's right-hand man in the \"Heisenberg\" case since the beginning. After the Salamanca Brothers nearly kill Hank, Gomez starts performing tasks that Hank cannot perform due to his handicap. At the end of Season 4 (on Hank's request), Gomez visits Gus's industrial laundry (with the underground lab) after a GPS links Gus's car to a visit. Gomez and [[Police dog|K9]] units find no trace of any lab on the property.<ref name=\"End Times\">{{Cite episode |title=End Times |episode-link=End Times (Breaking Bad) |series=Breaking Bad |series-link=Breaking Bad |network=[[AMC (TV channel)|AMC]] |date=October 2, 2011 |season=4 |number=12 |credits=[[Vince Gilligan]] (dir), [[Thomas Schnauz]], [[Moira Walley-Beckett]] (wrt)}}</ref>\n\nAfter Walt and Jesse ignite the lab,<ref name=\"Face Off\">{{Cite episode |title=Face Off |episode-link=Face Off (Breaking Bad) |series=Breaking Bad |series-link=Breaking Bad |network=[[AMC (TV channel)|AMC]] |date=October 9, 2011 |season=4 |number=13 |credits=[[Vince Gilligan]] (dir, wrt)}}</ref> Gomez returns with Hank to find it destroyed, with little evidence remaining.<ref name=\"Live Free or Die\">{{Cite episode |title=Live Free or Die |episode-link=Live Free or Die (Breaking Bad) |series=Breaking Bad |series-link=Breaking Bad |network=[[AMC (TV channel)|AMC]] |date=July 15, 2012 |season=5 |number=1 |credits=[[Michael Slovis]] (dir), [[Vince Gilligan]] (wrt)}}</ref> Gomez is the only DEA officer whom Hank tells about his revelation that Walter White is Heisenberg, and Gomez continues to be Hank's partner through their final investigation, which leads to both the arrest of Walt and a shootout with Jack's gang.

He consults with Hank after he finds Gale's notebook and asks what all the notes and drawings mean, and whether or not Gale may have been working in a meth lab.

Gus paid for Max's education in biochemistry and chemical engineering, at the [[Universidad de Santiago de Chile|University of Santiago]] in [[Chile]]. The pair then moved to Mexico and opened a chain of Los Pollos Hermanos chicken restaurants together. In the drug business, Max is the chemist; he cooked the crystal meth, samples of which he and Gus started giving away. These samples gained the attention of Don Eladio, a local drug lord, whom Max and Gus approached in the hope of convincing the Don to join them in the meth business. Don Eladio, unimpressed by these upstarts and nominally dismissive of selling methamphetamine in lieu of cocaine, had Hector kill Max on the patio of his mansion as Juan Bolsa watched. Gus is forced to watch his partner's fatal head wound bleed into the swimming pool, a vision that stays with him. After moving to the US, Gus sets up a college scholarship in Max's name (which Gale Boetticher won one year) and determines to avenge his friend's death.<ref name = \"Hermanos\" /> It is possible that Gus and Max's relationship may have been a romantic one; series creator Vince Gilligan commented that they \"probably were lovers,\" although he never completely confirmed or denied if that was the case.<ref name=\"entw\">{{cite web|url=http://popwatch.ew.com/2011/12/18/breaking-bad-vince-gilligan-season-finale/|title=Best of 2011 (Behind the Scenes): 'Breaking Bad' creator Vince Gilligan talks about That Scene from the season finale|author=Franich, Darren|work=Entertainment Weekly|date=December 18, 2011|accessdate=September 18, 2012}}</ref>\n\nThe character Maximino Arciniega shares his name with the real-life actor who plays Krazy-8 in Season 1.\n\n====Gale Boetticher====\nGale Boetticher (played by [[David Costabile]]) is a chemist hired by Gus Fring to help set up the new laboratory and serve as Walt's \"lab assistant.\" He holds an [[Master of Science|MS]] degree in [[organic chemistry]], with a specialty in X-ray [[crystallography]]. He describes himself as a \"[[nerd]]\" and a \"[[Libertarianism in the United States|libertarian]].\" He is single, [[vegan]] and apparently cultured.

He tells Gale that Walt has terminal cancer and that meth production cannot halt because of its high [[Overhead (business)|overhead]]. In reality, Walt is in remission, and Gus is planning to kill Walt, whom he now considers a liability for his unpredictable behavior (after he killed two street dealers to save Jesse's life) and his relationship with Hank, who continues to get closer to the truth as he investigates the source of the blue meth. Gale agrees to take over the lab full-time after one more cook with Walt. Walt realizes that Gus plans to replace him and has Jesse locate Gale's address so that Walt can kill him to ensure Gus still requires Jesse and Walt's services. Before he can kill Gale, Mike and Victor bring Walt to the lab, where they intend to kill Walt. Walt convinces them to let him speak to Jesse under the pretense of luring Jesse to the lab to be killed. Instead, Walt tells Jesse to kill Gale as quickly as possible, before Victor can prevent it.

As Hank investigates Gale and discovers Gus's fingerprints inside the apartment, he begins to suspect Gus of being connected to the meth trade. Hank finally realizes that Walt is Heisenberg after finding a book of Whitman poems at Walt's house and seeing that the \"W. W.\" dedication matches the tone and handwriting Hank observed in Gale's lab notes, with \"W. W.\" standing for both Walt Whitman and Walter White.\n\n=====''Better Call Saul''=====\nGale briefly appears in ''Better Call Saul'' when Gus visits him at the university where he's working as a post-graduate student and researcher. Gus asks Gale to test the purity of several methamphetamine samples before starting construction of the \"superlab\", foreshadowing Gale's role in ''Breaking Bad''.  In the Season 4 episode \"[[Winner (Better Call Saul)|Winner]]\", Gus shows Gale the nearly completed meth lab under the industrial laundry, which is revealed to have been constructed according to Gale's design.\n\n====Duane Chow====\nDuane Chow (played by James Ning) is the owner of Golden Moth Chemical, an industrial chemical manufacturing company that supplies chemicals to Gus's drug empire. During Gus's conflict with a Mexican drug cartel in Ciudad Ju\u00e1rez, the cartel enforcers come to Chow's offices and hold him hostage. Chow's captors are later killed by Mike, who shoots Chow in the hand for not telling Gus about the situation.<ref name=\"Full Measure\"/> After Gus's death, Chow starts being questioned by the DEA, as he was on Gus's payroll at the time of Gus's murder. Chow is also on the list of eleven men whom Lydia suggests that Mike kill before they can make a plea deal with the DEA (but Mike refuses). Lydia then hires one of the eleven, Chris Mara, to kill the other ten, and adds Mike to the list. Mara starts with Chow, whom he uses to lure Mike into a trap before shooting Chow in the head. Mike thwarts the attempt on his own life after getting from Chris the information Lydia gave him, and then kills Chris.<ref name=\"Madrigal\"/>\n\n====Ron Forenall====\nRon Forenall (played by Russ Dillon) is Mike Ehrmantraut's contact at Madrigal Electromotive's chemical warehouse in Houston. He is in constant contact with Lydia Rodarte-Quayle, who tells him which containers she has taken off the manifests, which he sends to Golden Moth Chemical Company in Albuquerque, which in turn forwards them on to Lavanderia Brilliante and Gus's lab.\n\nForenall is arrested after Hank and Gomez arrive at Madrigal's warehouse in Houston and Lydia identifies him in the warehouse.<ref name = \"Fifty-One\" /> Forenall later appears as one of the nine incarcerated members of Gus's organization who Lydia lists to be taken out, along with Dan Wachsberger, Mike's attorney who rolls over on them.

Per Gus's instructions, he provides Mike with cocaine to prepare a trap for Hector's smugglers when they cross the border.\n\n====Tyrus Kitt====\nTyrus Kitt (played by Ray Campbell) is one of Gus's henchmen. After Victor is killed, Gus promotes him to serve as Mike's second-in-command, monitoring Walt and Jesse's activities both inside and outside the lab. He spots Hector Salamanca leaving the DEA office, incorrectly assuming that Hector has turned into an informant. He is indirectly killed by Hector during the latter's showdown with Gus.<ref name=\"Face Off\"/> He reappears in ''Better Call Saul'', where he and Victor serve as co-muscle for Gus.\n\n====Chris Mara====\nChris Mara (played by Christopher King) is one of Gus's henchmen and Mike Ehrmantraut's errand runners, who runs errands among Fring, the mules, and the dealers. One of his other side jobs is to assist Tyrus Kitt in monitoring who is coming and going through the doors of both the Albuquerque Police Department and the DEA's Albuquerque office.\n\nChris first appears in \"Bug,\" where he is shown taking cover when Gaff opens fire on the operatives at the Los Pollos distribution center, killing one of them while Jesse stands paralyzed. He is later shown among the men looking for Walt when Walt goes into hiding.<ref name=\"Crawl Space\"/> Chris is watching from his car when Jesse exits the police station, after being questioned about Brock Cantillo's poisoning by ricin,<ref name=\"End Times\"/> and is seen when Hector Salamanca leaves the DEA office after questioning. He also is the one to drive Gus to the retirement home.<ref name = \"Face Off\" />\n\nChris later takes Duane Chow hostage in Chow's own home, forcing Chow to call Mike to come over so Chris can kill Mike. However, Mike sees Chris's car parked in Chow's driveway and senses that this is a trap. Mike outsmarts Chris with a toy on Chow's front door while he sneaks into Chow's house from the back. Chris confesses that since the DEA seized his hazard pay, he took up Lydia's offer that Mike refused: $10,000 for each of the 10 other men on the list, and triple for Mike. Mike then dispatches Chris in the same way that Chris killed Chow.<ref name=\"Madrigal\"/>\n\n====Dennis Markowski====\nDennis Markowski (played by Mike Batayeh) is the former manager of Lavanderia Brilliante, the industrial laundromat which served as the cover for Gus's superlab. Following Gus's death, the DEA incarcerates Dennis, as he is on Gus's payroll at the time of Gus's death. Dennis agrees to keep his mouth shut when Mike ensures that he will still receive his money from the drug empire.<ref name = \"Hazard Pay\">{{cite episode | title = Hazard Pay | episodelink = Hazard Pay | series = Breaking Bad | serieslink = Breaking Bad | credits = [[Adam Bernstein]] (dir), [[Peter Gould (writer)|Peter Gould]] (wrt) | network = [[AMC (TV channel)|AMC]] | airdate = July 29, 2012 | season = 5 | number = 3}}</ref> When Dennis's funds are confiscated, Dennis, through his attorney, proposes a plea deal to the DEA, but [[Hank Schrader|Hank]] refuses, believing he can get a better deal from one of Gus's other incarcerated henchmen. Dennis is later killed on Walt's orders by several other inmates who pour flammable liquid into Dennis's cell and ignite it, burning him alive.<ref name = \"Gliding Over All\" />\n\n====Victor====\nVictor (played by [[Jeremiah Bitsui]]) is Gus's loyal henchman.

Gus instructs Victor to give half of the money for Jesse's meth to Walter as a way to convince Walter to cook again. After Walt kills two of Gus's dealers, Walt tells Gus that Jesse is \"at least two time zones away.\" Victor guards the lab at all times when Walter and Gale are present and monitors their conversations. Walt suspects Gus is preparing to kill him and conspires with Jesse to kill Gale, making Walt indispensable as the only remaining cook. Victor picks up Walt from his home, telling him there is a leak in the lab. Walt is greeted by Mike when he arrives and deduces they plan to kill him. Walt begs Mike to spare him, offering to turn Jesse over. Under the pretext of contacting Jesse to lure him to a meeting, Walt convinces Mike and Victor to allow him to call Jesse using his cell phone. However, instead of arranging a meeting, Walt instructs Jesse to kill Gale before Mike kills Walt, leaving Walter as the only chemist available to Gus. Victor races to stop Jesse from killing Gale but arrives too late; he enters Gale's apartment and is seen by neighbors.<ref name = \"Full Measure\" /> He then forces Jesse back to the meth lab and watches over him and Walt with Mike until Gus arrives. He reveals that he knows how to cook meth himself from watching Walt and singlehandedly begins preparing a full batch in front of him. However, when Gus arrives, he unexpectedly murders Victor by slicing his throat with a box cutter. Walt, Jesse, and Mike are then forced to dispose of Victor's body using [[hydrofluoric acid]], echoing Walt and Jesse's previous experience with Emilio.<ref name=\"Box Cutter\"/> Walt later mentions to Jesse that Gus may have killed Victor because he had taken inappropriate liberties (such as cooking meth while Mike held Walt and Jesse hostage) and \"[flown] too close to the sun,\" as Walt put it.<ref name = \"Hazard Pay\" />\n\n=====''Better Call Saul''=====\nVictor is a recurring character introduced alongside Gus in season 3, first seen driving a black Escalade to the back of Los Pollos Hermanos to obtain the tracking device used on Mike. He and Tyrus later serve as Gus's bodyguards during the meeting with Mike. After Hector's operation takes a crippling blow, Victor hands out a cash payment to Mike as a token of gratitude from Gus. However, Mike refuses it. He also delivers parcels of cocaine to Hector's men as part of Hector's order to have his drugs be smuggled in Los Pollos Hermanos trucks.\n\nVictor again appears as one of Gus's henchmen in season 4. He is first seen following Nacho Varga around after Nacho causes Hector to suffer a stroke. After Gus kills Arturo and blackmails Nacho, he sends Victor and Tyrus out with Nacho to the desert. The two men fake evidence of a shooting attack to cover up Nacho's involuntary defection, and pin Arturo's death on a Salamanca rival (while also making it look like a repeat of Mike's truck robbery). As part of the cover-up, Victor shoots Nacho, wounding him to make it \"look real\".\n\nIn season 5, Victor picks up one of Gus' henchmen after he escapes from [[Hank Schrader]] and Steven Gomez before calling Gus to report in.\n\n====Dan Wachsberger====\nDan Wachsberger (played by Chris Freihofer) is an attorney hired by Mike Ehrmantraut to represent Ron Forenall, Dennis Markowski, and the other seven surviving members of [[Gustavo Fring]]'s operation running out of the Lavanderia Brilliante in Albuquerque. Wachsberger takes the money (Mike Ehrmantraut's \"legacy costs\") from Mike and then deposits it to ten safety deposit boxes at the Cradock Marine Bank in Albuquerque: nine for Gus's surviving guys and their families to use in lieu of their \"hazard pay\" and one larger box for Mike's granddaughter Kaylee on her 18th birthday.\n\nWachsberger first appears as he and Mike are going through the [[New Mexico Department of Corrections]] facility at [[Los Lunas]] south of Albuquerque. Dan signs in and tells the attending guard, Darla, that he has brought in his \"paralegal\" and they have come to see Dennis Markowski.<ref name=\"Hazard Pay\"/> Dan is consistently shown flirting with women, such as Darla and, at the bank, with Dorothy Yobs, whom he routinely lavishes with gifts of sugary baked goods. Dorothy gives Dan access to the safety deposit boxes at Cradock Marine Bank. Eventually, Hank and Gomez discover Mike and Dan's transactions and their safety deposit boxes at Cradock Marine Bank, and Gomez is sent to investigate. Gomez and his agents discover Dan making his routine drops in these boxes, arrest him, and successfully induce Dan to give them Mike.<ref name = \"Say My Name\">{{cite episode | title = Say My Name | episodelink = Say My Name | series = Breaking Bad | serieslink = Breaking Bad | credits = [[Thomas Schnauz]] (dir, wrt) | network = [[AMC (TV channel)|AMC]] | airdate = August 26, 2012 | season = 5 | number = 7}}</ref>\n\nThe next and last time Wachsberger appears, he is in federal lockup at La Tuna near the Texas border outside of [[Las Cruces, New Mexico|Las Cruces]], when, on Walt's orders, he is stabbed to death at the same time the nine surviving members of Gus's operation are also killed off, including Ron Forenall and Dennis Markowski.<ref name = \"Gliding Over All\" />\n\n=== Mexican drug cartel ===\n\n====Eladio Vuente====\nDon Eladio Vuente (played by [[Steven Bauer]]) is the head of a drug cartel in Ciudad Ju\u00e1rez which employed Juan Bolsa, Hector Salamanca, and Salamanca's nephews. He first met Gus Fring at a business meeting twenty years prior to the start of the series, where Gus and his partner Max attempted to propose a business deal wherein they would produce methamphetamine for the cartel. Unimpressed by their pitch, Don Eladio had Max executed for manipulating him into a meeting, but spared Gus's life due to an unrevealed past in Chile.<ref name = \"Hermanos\" /> At some time in the ensuing few years, he entered into a partnership with Gus, who served as Don Eladio's chief distributor in the American Southwest.\n\nFollowing the deaths of Juan Bolsa and the Cousins, and Gus's subsequent establishment of the superlab, Don Eladio orders retribution through his henchman Gaff, hijacking meth deliveries and killing some of Gus's operatives. Gus agrees to Eladio's demands\u2014the formula for the blue meth, the services of a chemist, and a 50% share in the business\u2014and travels to the cartel's superlab with Mike and Jesse. After Jesse cooks a successful batch, Eladio invites the three to a party at his villa attended by multiple capos of the cartel, toasting their new business venture with a bottle of premium tequila supplied by Gus, and chiding the latter for needing to be kept in line every twenty years. However, shortly afterwards the capos begin to collapse, victims of a poison Gus had put in the tequila. Eladio realizes that Gus (who has vomited up some of the poisoned tequila then soon after is given an antidote after escaping to his prepared field hospital) has betrayed him, but he collapses dead into the swimming pool before he can take any action.<ref name = \"Salud\" />\n\nHe reappears in ''Better Call Saul'' through a flashback, meeting and ridiculing Hector in his hacienda because of his inferiority to Gus Fring.\n\n====Juan Bolsa====\nJuan Bolsa (played by Javier Grajeda) is a high-level member of the Mexican drug cartel to which the Salamanca family and Gus belong. It is Bolsa who orders Tortuga's execution by The Cousins and later places his head on a booby-trapped tortoise for the DEA to find. He is also the cartel's liaison with Gus, and the one who arranges a meeting among Gus, the Cousins, and Hector to determine how to handle Walter following Tuco's death. Bolsa tells Gus he will urge the Salamanca family to be patient but advises that Gus risks losing favor with the cartel if he does not finish his business with Walter quickly.  He goes on to say that he cannot guarantee the Cousins will listen to reason and leave Walter alive until his business with Gus is done.<ref name = \"I.F.T.\">{{cite episode | title = I.F.T. | episodelink = | series = Breaking Bad | serieslink = Breaking Bad | credits = [[Michelle MacLaren]] (dir), [[George Mastras]] (wrt) | network = [[AMC (TV channel)|AMC]] | airdate = April 4, 2010 | season = 3 | number = 3}}</ref> He has forbidden the Cousins to kill Hank, the person who killed Tuco, because DEA agents and other law enforcement officers are usually designated \"off limits\" since attacking them brings on more police scrutiny and enforcement. Gus secretly sanctions an attack on Hank instead of Walter, resulting in severe injuries to Hank and the deaths of The Cousins.  Bolsa meets his end when Gus secretly tips off Mexican [[federales]] in [[Ciudad Ju\u00e1rez]], who kill Bolsa as retaliation for The Cousins' attack on Hank.<ref name=\"I See You\"/>  His name, translated literally from Spanish, is John Bag or John Sack; this is a nod to the character [[John Sacramoni|John \"Johnny Sack\" Sacrimoni]] from the [[HBO]] [[television drama series|drama]] ''[[The Sopranos]]''.  Both characters are high-ranking members of powerful crime families who are very level-headed, well-spoken, and act as intermediaries between their families and others.\n\n=====''Better Call Saul''=====\nIn a flashback to 1999, Bolsa delivers Gus's tribute to Don Eladio at Eladio's hacienda. Hector, and Ximenez Lercerda, the Salamancas' driver and smuggler are there so Hector can pay tribute to Eladio, but Hector is humiliated by the size of Gus's tribute. In \"Lantern,\" Gus and Bolsa meet with Hector; Bolsa decrees that because Hector's trucking network has been disrupted, his drugs must be smuggled from Mexico through Gus's Los Pollos Hermanos trucks.  This enrages Hector, who wants to continue his own smuggling and not be reliant on Gus.  When Hector suffers a stroke, Bolsa flees to keep secret the connection between the Salamancas and Don Eladio.\n\n====Hector Salamanca====\nHector Salamanca (played by [[Mark Margolis]]) is the elderly [[Don (honorific)|Don]] who was once a brutal Mexican drug kingpin and an associate of cartel boss [[#Don Eladio Vuente|Don Eladio]]. However, a stroke has rendered him unable to walk or speak, and he communicates only by ringing a hotel's front desk call bell attached to his wheelchair. Despite this, he is still of sound mind. He is [[#Tuco Salamanca|Tuco Salamanca's]] uncle, having raised Tuco as a son, along with Tuco's twin cousins Leonel and Marco. Though brutal, Hector is very loyal. He spent 17 years in [[San Quentin State Prison]], never once revealing any information to the authorities. He taught his nephews that family is everything and lives by the creed himself. Hector loathes [[Gustavo Fring]], calling him \"chicken man\" (\"hombre gallina\" in Spanish, literally \"hen man\") and a \"dirty South American.\" Likewise, Gus despises Hector for killing [[#Maximino Arciniega|Max]]<ref name = \"Hermanos\" /> and goes out of his way to torment the former kingpin by allowing Hector to live while he sees his younger relatives die, one by one. \n\nIn the season 2 premiere, Tuco kidnaps Walt and Jesse and brings them to his disabled uncle Hector's decrepit shack of a home. Walt attempts to poison Tuco's food with a hidden vial of ricin, but Hector is shown to be of sound mind and he saves Tuco by knocking the food onto the floor.  After killing Tuco in a shootout, Hank Schrader takes Hector in for questioning.  Hector refuses to cooperate and defecates in his pants, much to the disgust of everyone in the interrogation room.  Afterwards, he is sent to a nursing home near Albuquerque.\n\nIn season 3, The Cousins sneak into the U.S. to perform a retaliatory killing to avenge Tuco.  They visit Hector, their uncle, who gives them Walter White's name. When the hit is narrowly avoided through the intervention of Mike and Gus, The Cousins bring Hector to a meeting with Gus. Gus is able to postpone the hit for the time being by telling Hector that Walt is invaluable to the cartel's methamphetamine operations.\n\nIn the season 4 finale, Walt is able to convince Hector to help him lure Gus into the open. Hector meets with Hank Schrader at the DEA building under the guise of becoming an informant. Walt's ploy works when Tyrus spots Hector leaving the DEA building. Suspecting Hector of being an informant, Tyrus alerts Gus. Gus and Tyrus plan to kill Hector during a meeting in his nursing home room and Gus orders Hector to look at him. When a sorrowful-looking Hector finally looks at Gus (something Gus wanted Hector to do all season), Hector's facial expression changes to wrath as he begins repeatedly ringing his bell. Gus realizes that the bell is attached to a bomb under Hector's wheelchair and tries to run, but is caught in the explosion. Hector and Tyrus are instantly killed, while Gus dies a few moments after leaving the room.<ref name = \"Face Off\" />\n\n=====''Better Call Saul''=====\nAfter Mike and Nacho sideline Tuco by provoking him into attacking Mike over a staged fender bender, Hector approaches Mike and offers him $5,000 to recant his testimony that Tuco was carrying a gun, which will reduce Tuco's sentence. Mike refuses, but Hector makes repeated attempts to intimidate Mike into accepting, from having men break into Mike's house to having The Cousins threaten Mike's granddaughter. Mike eventually accepts $50,000 for recanting his testimony.\n\nDespite complying with Hector's demands, Mike is not happy about the threats to Kaylee's life and retaliates by attacking an ice cream truck transporting Hector's drug cash. Hector kills a witness who stopped to aid the driver, and later has the Cousins kill the driver and bury him in the desert. While Hector and the Cousins are preparing to kill the driver, Mike attempts to shoot Hector with a sniper rifle, but is stopped by someone unseen, who sets off his car horn and leaves a note warning him not to do it. Mike later learns it was Gus who tracked his location and warned him against killing Hector; Gus intends to take over Hector's drug operation, and believes the time is not yet right.\n\nHector is in competition with Gus for control of cross-border drug smuggling. The conflict escalates after Mike attacks another of Hector's trucks, this time planting drugs and causing two of Hector's drivers to get arrested at the customs inspection station. Juan Bolsa directs Gus to take over transportation of Hector's drugs, not realizing this is exactly what Gus wants.\n\nAfter Hector starts planning to take over Nacho's father's business for his own use, Nacho turns on Hector and enacts a plan where he switches out Hector's heart medication for ibuprofen. Hector suffers a stroke while meeting with Gus and Juan Bolsa, but Gus saves him with CPR and he is taken to the hospital.\n\nGus arranges for a specialist, Dr. Maureen Bruckner, to be flown in from Johns Hopkins in Baltimore to oversee Hector's care. Over the next few months, her therapy regimen restores Hector's mental faculties, but he's unable to speak and he's immobile except for the index finger of his right hand. Gus has her discontinue treatment, effectively trapping his sound mind in his unhealed body.\n\n====Tuco Salamanca====\nTuco Salamanca (played by [[Raymond Cruz]]) is a [[Mexico|Mexican]] drug [[Boss (crime)|kingpin]] who becomes Walter and Jesse's meth distributor and the main antagonist of the second half of Season One and the beginning of Season Two. He is unpredictable and prone to violent outbursts. After Walt and Jesse witness him brutally assault and murder one of his henchmen, they plan to poison him by coating their next delivery of meth with [[ricin]]. The [[Drug Enforcement Administration]] (DEA) raids Tuco's headquarters before they can execute their plan. Tuco then [[carjacking|carjacks]] Jesse and kidnaps him and Walt, suspecting they reported the murder to the authorities.\n\nTuco forces Walt and Jesse into Jesse's trunk, and drives to the remote desert house of his uncle, [[#Hector Salamanca|Hector]], who cannot walk or speak due to a previous [[stroke]]. He reveals that his cousins Leonel and Marco are coming to the house to take them all to Mexico, where Walt will cook his blue meth for the cartel. Thinking Hector is unaware of his surroundings, Walt sprinkles Tuco's food with ricin while Tuco is not looking, but Hector foils the plan. Tuco realizes what Walt intended and attacks Jesse while threatening to kill him with an [[M16 rifle]]. During the ensuing scuffle, Jesse shoots Tuco in the abdomen.\n\n[[Hank Schrader|Hank]] arrives, having followed the [[LoJack]] signal of Jesse's car in the belief that Jesse is selling [[marijuana]] to Walt. Walt and Jesse hide nearby and see Tuco stagger to Jesse's car, recover his rifle, and fire at Hank. Hank returns fire with a [[Glock]] pistol and kills Tuco.<ref name=\"Grilled\"/> Hank's DEA colleagues present him a paperweight embedded with Tuco's [[Grill (jewelry)|grill]] as a trophy, which he initially prizes but later throws into a river in disgust.<ref name=\"Breakage\"/>\n\n=====''Better Call Saul''=====\nTuco reappears in ''[[Better Call Saul]]''. His first appearance comes after Cal and Lars, two skateboarding brothers working for [[Saul Goodman|Jimmy McGill]] accidentally target Tuco's grandmother for one of Jimmy's scams. Tuco and his crew take Jimmy, Cal, and Lars into the desert to kill them, but Jimmy talks Tuco into settling for breaking one leg of each skateboarder.\n\nIn season 2, Tuco's lieutenant, Nacho Varga, becomes wary of Tuco's violent methods and requests Mike's help to assassinate him. Instead, Mike designs a scheme to temporarily sideline Tuco by having him assault Mike in front of the police.  Tuco is charged for assault with a deadly weapon because of the gun he was carrying, but Hector bribes Mike to say the gun was his. Tuco is convicted of the lesser charge of simple assault, and receives a shorter prison sentence.  While in prison, Tuco stabs another inmate and injures a corrections officer, triggering an angina attack in Hector which starts Nacho on a plan to induce a fatal heart attack.  Tuco's sentence is extended, indicating that his release comes shortly before the events of ''Breaking Bad''.\n\n==== Leonel and Marco Salamanca ====\nLeonel and Marco Salamanca (played by [[Daniel and Luis Moncada]]), referred to as \"The Cousins\", are hitmen for a [[Ciudad Ju\u00e1rez]] Mexican drug cartel. Their austere, mechanical physicality and virtually non-verbal interaction makes them a fearsome presence and they kill without hesitation or emotion. Leonel and Marco's killings included the decapitation by [[machete]] of Tortuga, whose head was then attached to a tortoise as part of a bomb which inflicted casualties on several DEA agents.<ref name=\"I.F.T.\" />\n\nAs children, the Cousins were raised by Hector Salamanca, who once tested them when he stopped a boyhood fight by nearly drowning Marco, which forced Leonel to hit Hector to make him release his grip.  After Marco caught his breath, Hector reinforced the lesson that \"family is all.\"<ref name=\"One Minute\" /> Following the death of their cousin Tuco, Hector summoned them to New Mexico to kill Walter. En route to being smuggled into the US, they hid with other undocumented immigrants in the back of a hay truck, and killed the entire group when one recognized them by their silver skull boot tips.<ref name=\"No M\u00e1s\">{{Cite episode |title=No M\u00e1s |episode-link=No M\u00e1s (Breaking Bad) |series=Breaking Bad |series-link=Breaking Bad |network=[[AMC (TV channel)|AMC]] |date=March 21, 2010 |season=3 |number=1}}</ref>\n\nThe Cousins quickly tracked Walter to his house and were waiting inside to kill him when Mike informed Victor of their presence.  Victor told Gus, who contacted the cartel.  The Cousins then received a text message telling them to abort, so they left without Walter knowing they had been there.<ref name=\"Caballo sin Nombre\">{{Cite episode |title=Caballo sin Nombre |episode-link=Caballo sin Nombre |series=Breaking Bad |series-link=Breaking Bad |network=[[AMC (TV channel)|AMC]] |date=March 28, 2010 |season=3 |number=2}}</ref> Although Gus gave them permission to kill Walter after Gus's partnership with him ended three months later, Gus was warned that the Cousins would probably ignore the arrangement. Mike later found outside Walt's house a chalk drawing of a scythe, which he believed the Cousins have left to send the message that their murder of Walt was imminent.<ref name=\"I.F.T.\" />\n\nGus redirected the Cousins by telling them Hank killed Tuco, and he told them they had his permission to kill Hank even though the cartel refrained from killing law enforcement officers, because that would draw undue attention to their activities.  Leonel and Marco moved to kill Hank, but Gus anonymously warned Hank just before the confrontation.  Aware of the threat, Hank saw Leonel advancing on him and backed his car up quickly, trapping  Leonel between his car and another, which crushed Leonel's legs. Marco opened fire on Hank, who escaped out the passenger side door and crawled away. Marco strode after Hank, shooting and killing a passerby who surprised him, while another bystander escaped the same fate when Marco stopped to reload. Hank then surprised Marco from behind and shot him in the chest four times, but  all four bullets were stopped by Marco's [[bulletproof vest]]. Marco shot Hank twice in the chest, but rather than finish him off with another shot, Marco returned to his car for an axe. Hank took advantage of the pause to load Leonel's empty gun with a [[hollow-point]] round that Marco had dropped next to him.  When Marco re-approached Hank, Hank killed him with a shot to the head.<ref name=\"One Minute\" /><ref name=\"Sunset\" />\n\nTo silence Leonel while he was in the hospital following his leg amputation, Gus distracted the police assigned to the security detail by bringing them food from Los Pollos Hermanos, giving Mike the opportunity to sneak into Leonel's room and administer a lethal injection.  Leonel died, and Mike quietly disposed of the syringe he used, unnoticed by the police officers nearby.\n\n===== ''Better Call Saul'' =====\nThe Cousins reappeared in ''[[Better Call Saul]]'' as Hector's enforcers. They are first shown threatening Mike's granddaughter Kaylee when Mike refuses to recant his testimony against Tuco. When Mike is waiting to shoot Hector from a hilltop with a sniper rifle, he sees Leonel and Marco kill the Salamanca's ice cream truck driver and drug smuggler Ximenez Lecerda, who Mike had robbed a few days earlier.\n\nIn Season 4, after Gus blackmails Nacho into becoming a double agent, he has Nacho trick the Cousins into attacking the Espinosa gang. After wiping out the entire compound, they flee to Mexico to escape police scrutiny.\n\n====Gaff====\nGaff (played by Maurice Compte) is a member of Don Eladio's drug cartel. He is first seen coordinating the hijacking of a Los Pollos Hermanos truck that is transporting drugs and killing the guards inside by filling it with engine exhaust fumes. Gaff serves as the cartel's representative in a sitdown with Gus, where he rejects Gus's offer of $50 million to cut all ties and informs Gus there will be no negotiation, only an ultimatum to deliver the formula for the blue methamphetamine. Later, Gaff kills one of Gus's men with a sniper rifle at the chicken farm but stops shooting when Gus presents himself as a target and agrees to negotiate with Eladio. Gaff is present when the cartel is poisoned; Mike garrotes him as he checks on the ill Eladio.<ref name = \"Salud\">{{cite episode | title = Salud | episodelink = Salud (Breaking Bad)| series = Breaking Bad | serieslink = Breaking Bad | credits = [[Michelle MacLaren]] (dir), [[Peter Gould (writer)|Peter Gould]], [[Gennifer Hutchison]] (wrt) | network = [[AMC (TV channel)|AMC]] | airdate = September 19, 2011 | season = 4 | number = 10}}</ref>\n\n====Gonzo====\nGonzo (played by Jesus Payan Jr.) is Tuco Salamanca's brother-in-law and one of his lieutenants. He dies while moving No Doze's body from under a stack of cars in a junkyard; the stack shifts and catches his arm under it, partially severing it and causing him to [[exsanguination|bleed to death]]. When Walter and Jesse learn he is dead, they incorrectly assume that Tuco is killing any witnesses to No Doze's murder, and fear for their own lives.

Cartel operatives cut off his head and place it atop a tortoise (''tortuga'' is Spanish for \"tortoise\") with \"HOLA DEA\" (\"Hello DEA\") written across its shell. A hidden bomb in the head then explodes, killing the tortoise and a DEA agent, and severely injuring several of the DEA agents and Mexican policemen on the scene. Hank is physically unharmed as he was far enough from the explosion, but later develops [[Posttraumatic stress disorder|post-traumatic stress syndrome]].<ref name = \"Negro y Azul\">{{cite episode | title = Negro y Azul | episodelink = | series = Breaking Bad | serieslink = Breaking Bad | credits = [[F\u00e9lix Enr\u00edquez Alcal\u00e1|Felix Alcala]] (dir), [[John Shiban]] (wrt) | network = [[AMC (TV channel)|AMC]] | airdate = April 19, 2009 | season = 2 | number = 7}}</ref> It is later revealed that Tortuga was beheaded with a [[machete]] by Tuco's cousins [[#Leonel and Marco Salamanca|Leonel and Marco Salamanca]] under [[#Juan Bolsa|Juan Bolsa]]'s direct order.<ref name = \"I.F.T.\" />\n\n===Independent drug traders===\n\n====Declan====\nDeclan (played by [[Louis Ferreira]]) is a meth dealer who operates in [[Phoenix, Arizona]]. Mike attempts to sell Declan the methylamine stolen in the train robbery, but Walt suggests that Declan buy out Mike and Jesse, then take over distribution of Walt's methamphetamine in return for 35% of revenue, revealing that he is Heisenberg, the mysterious meth cooker whose product is renowned for its exceptional purity.<ref name=\"Say My Name\"/><ref name = \"Buyout\">{{cite episode | title = Buyout | episodelink = Buyout (Breaking Bad) | series = Breaking Bad | serieslink = Breaking Bad | credits = [[Colin Bucksey]] (dir), [[Gennifer Hutchison]] (wrt) | network = [[AMC (TV channel)|AMC]] | airdate = August 19, 2012 | season = 5 | number = 6}}</ref> After Walt stops producing meth, Lydia's customers express dissatisfaction with the product, so Lydia tries to convince Declan to replace his meth cook with Todd.

According to Jesse, they met when they were still in elementary school. In the \"Pilot\" episode, Emilio is arrested during a DEA raid on a house (at which Walter is present during a \"ride along\" with Hank) in which the DEA is looking for a meth supplier who goes by the street name \"Captain Cook\" (Jesse himself). As Jesse proposes Krazy-8 to manage the distribution of the superior quality methamphetamine he produced with his new partner, he realized that Emilio made bail. Suspicious that Jesse ratted him out to the police (although it is later revealed Krazy-8 was in fact a DEA informant), Emilio and Krazy-8 force Jesse to lead them to his new partner. Emilio recognizes Walter from the time of his arrest and suggests killing both Walter and Jesse. Walter convinces them to spare their lives if he teaches them his meth formula. While the three are in the RV, Walt deliberately causes a chemical explosion and flees, trapping Emilio and Krazy-8 inside the RV with deadly [[phosphine]] gas. Emilio dies and Jesse subsequently disposes of his body by dissolving it in [[hydrofluoric acid]], albeit disastrously as it also dissolves Jesse's bathtub.<ref name = \"Pilot\">{{cite episode | title = Pilot | episodelink = Pilot (Breaking Bad) | series = Breaking Bad | serieslink = Breaking Bad | credits = [[Vince Gilligan]] (director, writer) | network = [[AMC (TV channel)|AMC]] | airdate = January 20, 2008 | season = 1 | number = 1}}</ref><ref name = \"Cat's in the Bag...\">{{cite episode | title = Cat's in the Bag... | episodelink = | series = Breaking Bad | serieslink = Breaking Bad | credits = [[Adam Bernstein]] (dir), [[Vince Gilligan]] (wrt) | network = [[AMC (TV channel)|AMC]] | airdate = January 27, 2008 | season = 1 | number = 2}}</ref>\n\n==== Domingo Molina ====\nDomingo Gallardo \"Krazy-8\" Molina (played by Maximino Arciniega)<ref>{{cite web |title=Krazy-8's Breaking Bad Backstory (As Revealed In Better Call Saul) |url=https://screenrant.com/breaking-bad-krazy-8-backstory-better-call-saul/ |website=Screen Rant |accessdate=11 March 2020 |date=15 September 2019}}</ref> is a meth distributor associated with his cousin Emilio and Jesse Pinkman and is the main antagonist of the first half of Season One. Unbeknown to Walter and Jesse, Krazy-8 is a DEA informant, who acquired the customers of the dealers he ratted out. Krazy-8 becomes suspicious of Jesse when Jesse attempts to sell him a new product after Emilio's arrest, and Krazy-8 forces Jesse to take him to Jesse's new partner. Krazy-8 and Emilio suspect Walter is involved with law enforcement and appear intent on killing him until Walter offers to teach Krazy-8 his drug formula. While mixing chemicals, Walter creates a small explosion that produces [[phosphine]] gas which appears to kill both Emilio and Krazy-8. Emilio dies, but Krazy-8 regains consciousness, prompting Jesse and Walt to imprison him in Jesse's basement for several days as they ponder what to do with him.<ref name=\"Pilot\" /><ref name=\"Cat's in the Bag...\" /> Walt begins to bond with Krazy-8, who has regained his health, feeding him and sharing beers, and attempts to rationalize freeing him, but strangles him with a bicycle lock upon realizing that Krazy-8 plans to attack him with a concealed piece of a broken crockery.

Initially one of the dealers, he takes on a lieutenant role under Nacho after Hector Salamanca suffers a stroke and becomes paralyzed, and continues in this position when Lalo Salamanca arrives from Mexico to oversee operations. Lalo is the one to have given Domingo the nickname \"Ocho Loco\" (Spanish for \"Crazy Eight\") based on a bad poker hand he played during one of their games.<ref>{{cite web |title=Better Call Saul Reveals Silly Way Breaking Bad's Krazy-8 Got His Name |url=https://screenrant.com/better-call-saul-season-5-krazy-8-breaking-bad-nickname-explained/ |website=ScreenRant |accessdate=3 April 2020 |date=26 February 2020}}</ref> Krazy-8 is arrested when one of the Salamanca drug houses is discovered by the local police, leading Nacho to seek Jimmy McGill's legal services to help free him. Jimmy, as Saul Goodman, creates a ploy that draws Hank to see Domingo, and through Saul's machinations, secures Domingo's release by assuring that he will be Hank's CI.\n\nThe fourth-season character [[#Maximino Arciniega|Maximino Arciniega]] shares his name with the actor who portrayed Krazy-8.\n\n====Jack Welker====\nJack Welker (played by [[Michael Bowen (actor)|Michael Bowen]]) is Todd's uncle and the leader of a white supremacist gang. Walter pays Jack to kill Mike's crew after they are arrested, because Walt fears they can identify him as a member of Gus's operation and may enter into plea bargains since the DEA has stopped the payments Gus had arranged for their families. Jack's gang kills nine of Mike's men and their lawyer Dan Wachsberger in three prisons, within two minutes, which prevents any of them from warning the others or law enforcement authorities from adding extra protection.<ref name=\"Gliding Over All\"/> Jack also heads his gang's massacre of Declan's at Lydia's behest after Declan refuses Lydia's request to replace his shoddy meth cook with Todd.<ref name = \"Buried\" />\n\nJack and his crew are later hired by Walter to kill Jesse in exchange for teaching Todd to cook meth one more time. When Walter is lured to the money's location by Jesse, he calls Jack's crew for help, but calls it off when he sees Hank and Gomez are with Jesse. Nonetheless, Jack and his crew arrive and engage in a shootout with Hank and Gomez.<ref name = \"To'hajiilee\">{{cite episode | title = To'hajiilee | episodelink = To'hajiilee | series = Breaking Bad | serieslink = Breaking Bad | credits = [[Michelle MacLaren]] (dir), [[George Mastras]] (wrt) | network = [[AMC (TV channel)|AMC]] | airdate = September 8, 2013 | season = 5 | number = 13}}</ref> Following the shootout, in which Gomez is killed, Jack murders Hank and abducts Jesse (initially to kill him, then to force him to work as an enslaved meth cook). Jack then orders the gang to dig up Walt's barrels of money (containing approximately $80 million), but at Todd's behest he leaves Walt alive with one barrel (about $11 million).<ref name=\"Ozymandias\"/>\n\nWhen Walter arrives at his hideout and remotely activates an M60 machine gun, the massive bullet spray kills Jack's henchmen, except Todd who manages to duck in time (but is strangled by an enraged Jesse), fatally wounding Jack as well as Walter himself. Jack, despite his critical condition, still attempts to leverage Walter's remaining money, but Walter coldly shoots him mid-sentence with his own gun, in the same manner that Jack shot Hank.\n\nJack's gang includes his second-in-command Kenny ([[Kevin Rankin (actor)|Kevin Rankin]]), as well as Frankie (Patrick Sane), Lester ([[Tait Fletcher]]), and Matt (Matthew T. Metzler).\n\n===Jesse's friends and family===\n\n==== Andrea Cantillo ====\nAndrea Cantillo (played by [[Emily Rios]]) is a love interest of Jesse Pinkman's. She is a recovering [[meth]] addict and single mother to a young son named Brock (played by Ian Posada). Jesse meets her at a drug addicts' support group meeting and initially tries to get her to relapse so she will become a customer of his, but he reverses course when he learns she has a young son to care for. He engages in a romantic relationship with her, but ends it when he discovers that the 11-year-old boy who killed his friend \"Combo\" is her younger brother Tomas Cantillo (played by Angelo Martinez). After the break-up, she confronts Jesse at his home about a large sum of money he had left for her at her home. He tells her the money is for her to move out of her bad neighborhood and to help raise her son. Saul continues to deliver money to her, in her new home, on Jesse's behalf. In Season 4, she and Jesse reunite. When Brock is poisoned, Jesse rushes to the hospital and stays there until the doctors notify him that Brock will survive. In Season 5, Walt manipulates Jesse into leaving her, by advising Jesse that he would have to be honest with her about all the crimes he has committed. While Jesse does send them off again, he continues providing for them financially. Later in the season, Andrea is again contacted by Walt in a failed attempt to lure Jesse out of DEA protection. Walter assigns [[Jack Welker|Jack]] to watch over the house in case Jesse makes an appearance. Subsequently, Jack uses her as leverage against Jesse, who is kept prisoner by him and his team to cook meth for them. After Jesse attempts to escape from Jack's gang, [[Todd Alquist|Todd]] shoots and kills Andrea while Jesse is forced to watch.\n\n====Brock Cantillo====\nBrock Cantillo  (played by Ian Posada) is [[Andrea Cantillo|Andrea]]'s eight-year-old son. Andrea is a recovering [[meth]] addict and single mother. Jesse meets her at a drug addicts' [[twelve-step program]] meeting and initially tries to get her to relapse, so she will become his customer, but he reverses course when he meets Brock and realizes she has a young son to care for. Jesse engages in a romantic relationship with Andrea, but ends it when he discovers that the 11-year-old boy who killed his friend \"Combo\" is her younger brother Tomas Cantillo (played by Angelo Martinez); however, Jesse continues to offer financial support to Andrea and Brock.\n\nIn Season 4, Andrea and Jesse reunite. When Brock gets sick, Jesse rushes to the hospital, and warns the doctors about a possible ricin poisoning, then stays there until the doctors notify him that Brock will survive (it turns out that the boy was indeed poisoned, although not with ricin but with [[lily of the valley]]; still, this timely warning put them on the right track). Jesse fears Brock was poisoned by a [[ricin]] cigarette [[Problem Dog|Jesse was carrying]]. Walt tries to convince Jesse that [[Gus Fring|Gus]] poisoned Brock. This manipulation by Walt renews Jesse's loyalty to him rather than to Gus. In the final season's episode \"[[Confessions (Breaking Bad)|Confessions]]\" Jesse suddenly changes his mind about leaving town and assuming a new identity when he realizes Walt poisoned Brock. Jesse then rushes to Walt's house and attempts to burn it down, but is intercepted by [[Hank Schrader|Hank]].\n\nSubsequently, Brock and Andrea are used as leverage against Jesse, who is kept prisoner by [[Todd Alquist|Todd]] and Jack's gang to cook meth for them. After Jesse attempts to escape, Todd shoots and kills Andrea while Jesse is forced to watch. Then Jesse is threatened with Brock's death if he attempts to escape again.\n\nIn ''[[El Camino: A Breaking Bad Movie]]'', Jesse writes a letter to Brock as he prepares to leave for a new life in [[Alaska]] with Brock being the only person he shows any interest in communicating with. After reading the letter, Ed promises to mail it next month when he is in [[Mexico City]], ensuring that Brock will get it and that it cannot be traced back to Jesse in Alaska.\n\n====Jane Margolis====\nJane Margolis (played by [[Krysten Ritter]]) is Jesse's neighbor, landlady, and lover. She is a prolific [[Drawing|drafter]], a skill that she has used to become a tattoo artist despite not having any tattoos. She is also a recovering drug addict. She discovers that Jesse also has a history of drawing, and each is intrigued by the other. They quickly become a couple, and she relapses into drug addiction, introducing Jesse to [[heroin]]. She later phones Walt and threatens to expose him if he refuses to give Jesse his share of money from a major methamphetamine deal with [[Gus Fring]], a deal that Jesse had nearly ruined by his drug use. Her actions work. After Walt drops off Jesse's cut of nearly a half million dollars to his duplex apartment, she and Jesse discuss running away together to [[New Zealand]] to start new lives. They then enter Jesse's bedroom and see the heroin, but instead of throwing it away as they had promised themselves earlier, they get high and fall asleep. That night Walt returns to the apartment and finds the drugged-out couple unconscious in bed. In the process of trying to wake Jesse from his stupor, Walt accidentally turns Jane on her back.  Still asleep, she soon begins to vomit, and Walt silently stands at the bedside watching her choke and then die from [[asphyxiation]]. Series creator Vince Gilligan later explained Walt's motive for allowing Jane to die. In 2013, during a panel discussion about ''Breaking Bad'' in New York City for the [[Film Society of Lincoln Center]], he stated that Walt was afraid that Jane's bad influence would lead Jesse to an early death from a heroin overdose.<ref name=\"Gilligangda\">{{cite web|title=Breaking Bad Q&A: Vince Gilligan|last=Gilligan|first=Vince|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGphF6Aqq9Y|work=Breaking Bad at the Film Society of Lincoln Center|publisher=YouTube|accessdate=August 28, 2013|location=Film Society of Lincoln Center}}</ref>\n\nJane's death manifests significant repercussions throughout the rest of the series, and is largely responsible for Jesse's downward spiral throughout the first half of the [[Breaking Bad (season 3)|third season]], as well as her father [[#Donald Margolis|Donald]]'s deep depression that affects him to the point that he fails in his duties as an air-traffic controller, leading to a mid-air collision between a 737 and a King Air 350 (\"[[ABQ (Breaking Bad)|ABQ]]\"). In the episode \"[[Fly (Breaking Bad)|Fly]]\", while under the influence of sleeping pills, Walt is tormented by his guilt over his inaction towards Jane; he reveals to Jesse that on the same night she died he unknowingly met her father in a bar (only knowing it was him after seeing him in the news following the plane crash), then questions the statistical improbability of that sequence of events, but stops shy of revealing his involvement. Walt finally reveals to Jesse the full measure of his role in Jane's death in the series' ante-penultimate episode, \"[[Ozymandias (Breaking Bad)|Ozymandias]]\", as a final blow after he ordered Jack to kill him, deeming him responsible for Hank's death and for the loss of his fortune.\n\nJane appears in a flashback in ''[[El Camino: A Breaking Bad Movie]]'', reminding Jesse that sometimes the universe takes people towards bad places, and despite her free spirited nature she considers that it is better to make life's important decisions oneself.\n\n==== Brandon Mayhew ====\nBrandon \"Badger\" Mayhew (played by [[Matt Jones (actor)|Matt L. Jones]]) is [[Jesse Pinkman|Jesse]]'s friend. Despite being on probation, Badger still uses drugs. He had a job as a mascot for a bank, advertising on the street. During Season 1, Badger leaves the job to briefly team up with Jesse in order to cook crystal meth. However, disagreements between the two soon occur, and they bitterly part ways. In Season 2, Badger and Jesse reconcile, and he helps clear the meth lab from Jesse's basement and assists in hiding Jesse's RV to avert police suspicion. Walt and Jesse later employ Badger to sell their product, but he is soon arrested, [[Better Call Saul (Breaking Bad)|causing complications]]. Once released, Badger flees New Mexico to lie low in [[California]] for a while. After Badger returns to New Mexico, Jesse takes advantage of him by easily persuading him to start selling for them again. Later, Badger appears at a [[Narcotics Anonymous]] meeting with [[List of Breaking Bad characters#Skinny Pete|Skinny Pete]], informing a group of recovering drug addicts that \"Blue Sky\" ([[Walter White (Breaking Bad)|Walt]] and Jesse's product) is back in town with the intention of finding new buyers. Soon, he and Skinny Pete begin to find the meetings helpful and continue to attend regularly. Badger helps Jesse several more times over the series, and is in attendance at Jesse's house party, which lasted several days. He is also the lead singer for a band with Jesse called Twa\u00fcghtHamm\u00ebr. Badger is a [[science fiction]] fan and discusses an idea for a ''[[Star Trek]]'' script at length in the episode \"[[Blood Money (Breaking Bad)|Blood Money]].\" He and [[Skinny Pete]] help Walt threaten [[#Gretchen and Elliott Schwartz|the Schwartzes]] in the series finale, \"[[Felina (Breaking Bad)|Felina]]\", by holding laser pointers to imitate [[sniper rifle]]s.\n\nBadger, along with Skinny Pete, appear in [[El Camino: A Breaking Bad Movie|''El Camino'']], helping Jesse hide for a night and to distract the police to give time for Jesse to escape. In particular, Badger drives Skinny Pete's car to the Mexico border while letting Jesse take his own car as Skinny Pete claims that \"no self-respecting outlaw would be caught dead in that car.\" Jesse drives Badger's car throughout the remainder of the movie until he is taken by Ed to [[Alaska]] to start a new life.\n\n====Skinny Pete==== \nSkinny Pete, real name Peter (played by [[Charles Baker (actor)|Charles Baker]]), is Jesse's friend. He served time in prison with Tuco and introduces him to Jesse. Jesse recruits Skinny Pete to deal meth, although Pete is on probation. When Pete is mugged by two addicts, Jesse is forced to get the money and product back. After Badger is arrested and Combo is killed, Pete quits dealing for Jesse, fearing being sent back to prison and for his own safety. He decides to sell meth for Jesse again, albeit on a smaller scale. He attends [[Narcotics Anonymous]] meetings with Badger. After following the program together and staying clean, they relapse when Jesse tempts them with meth. After a few days of heavy meth use they leave Jesse's house. In the [[Breaking Bad (season 5)|Season 5]] episode \"[[Hazard Pay]],\" Skinny Pete is shown to be a talented pianist as he plays a small section of [[C.P.E. Bach]]'s ''[[Solfeggietto]]'' at a music store.<ref>{{youtube|d3dzOf8IXFQ|'Breaking Bad' Star Charles Baker on Working With Bryan Cranston}}</ref> He is also seen in the mid-season premiere \"[[Blood Money (Breaking Bad)|Blood Money]],\" hanging out at Jesse's house and listening to Badger's ''[[Star Trek]]'' script.\n\nSkinny Pete is seen briefly in the series finale, having been hired by Walt (along with Badger) to use [[laser pointer]]s to imitate [[sniper rifle]]s when Walt threatens Gretchen and Elliot should they decide to not take his money and give it to his children. The two are also the ones who tell Walt that indeed his trademark blue meth is still circulating, as pure as when he was producing it with Jesse, meaning that Jesse is still alive, something Walt did not know.\n\nPete, along with Badger, appears in ''El Camino'', helping Jesse hide for a night and attempt to get rid of Todd Alquist's car. When the Lo-Jack is activated on the car, Pete has Badger take Pete's car to the Mexico border, the opposite direction Jesse is traveling in. At the same time, Pete takes the El Camino and Jesse takes Badger's car which Pete says no self-respecting outlaw would be caught dead in. Pete explains that he'll tell the police that Jesse came to him for help and they traded pink slips on their cars, explaining why Pete now has the El Camino. Pete gives Jesse his trademark hat to help him avoid detection, and when Jesse asks why he's helping, he says Jesse is his hero but it is hinted he is driven by guilt over taking Walter White's money in Felina <!-- Maybe the episode title should go in a footnote. -->. Pete is last seen in the film moving the El Camino to his driveway to await the arrival of the police.\n\nBefore the release of ''El Camino'', [[Netflix]] dropped a teaser trailer of the DEA interrogating Pete on Jesse's whereabouts. Though it was not used in the film, several critics speculated after the premiere that the scene likely occurred after Skinny Pete parted ways with Jesse, making this his final chronological appearance.<ref name=\"rs recap\">{{cite web |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/tv/tv-recaps/el-camino-breaking-bad-movie-recap-895354/ |title=\u2018El Camino: A Breaking Bad Movie\u2019 Recap: Jesse Pinkman Is Born Again |last=Sepinwall |first=Alan |date=October 12, 2019 |website=Rolling Stone |access-date=October 17, 2019}}</ref>\n\n==== Christian Ortega ====\nChristian \"Combo\" Ortega (played by Rodney Rush) is Jesse's friend and a dealer of Jesse's methamphetamine. He is also revealed to have been the one who originally owned the RV that Walt and Jesse cooked meth in, which Combo had sold to Jesse for $1,400 without his family's knowledge, which provides a big clue for Hank when tracking down \"Heisenberg.\"\n\nCombo is later killed in \"[[Mandala (Breaking Bad)|Mandala]]\" when a rival drug group corners him while he is dealing methamphetamine on \"foreign turf.\" Combo calls his friend Skinny Pete to report two men are \"mad eyeballing\" him. As he hangs up the phone, a kid on a bicycle shoots him several times, killing him on the street. Combo's death drives Jesse to spiral into drug addiction. Jesse eventually learns that the kid is Tomas Cantillo, the little brother of his new girlfriend Andrea and that Combo was murdered as part of a [[Initiation|gang initiation]]. Jesse subsequently seeks retribution upon the dealers for Combo's murder and the murder of Tomas, putting him at odds with Gus Fring.\n\n====Adam and Diane Pinkman====\nAdam Pinkman (played by Michael Bofshever) and Diane Pinkman (played by [[Tess Harper]]) are Jesse Pinkman's parents. Due to Jesse's drug abuse, they have a strained relationship with their son, which results in them kicking him out of his late aunt's house, where Jesse had been living after serving as his aunt's caretaker and friend. Adam and Diane renovate the home, preparing it for sale. Unbeknownst to them, Jesse works with Saul Goodman to reacquire the home. Claiming to represent an anonymous buyer, Saul presents an offer significantly under market value.  Offended, the Pinkmans begin to leave the negotiating table. As they are leaving, Saul mentions that the home used to host a meth lab, which is not revealed as required in the property [[Convention of disclosure|disclosures]].  Realizing that the home price will plummet and they may be sued, Adam and Diane Pinkman reluctantly accept Saul's offer.\n\nOn the closing date, Jesse visits his parents at the newly renovated home. When Jesse heads to the front door, Diane tells Jesse that the house has been sold, and that he needs to leave, as the new owners will be stopping by shortly. When Jesse does not stop, a confused Mrs. Pinkman asks where he is going. Jesse reveals that he is the new owner.\n\nThe Pinkmans appear in ''El Camino'', requesting in a news interview that Jesse turn himself in. Knowing his parents are probably being monitored by the police, Jesse calls, indicates a willingness to turn himself in, and asks them to pick him up.  Before hanging up, Jesse tells his parents they did their best when raising him, and the life he has led and the problems he has caused are his fault, not theirs.  After his parents leave, Jesse's call is revealed to be a ruse to draw them and police away from the house.  Jesse enters unobserved and recovers two handguns from his parents' safe, a [[Colt Woodsman]] and an [[Iver Johnson#Safety automatic hammerless|Iver Johnson Hammerless]].<ref>{{cite news |last=Eger |first=Chris |date=October 14, 2019 |title=Jesse Pinkman is Back: The Curious Guns of El Camino |url=https://www.guns.com/news/2019/10/14/jesse-pinkman-is-back-the-curious-guns-of-el-camino |work=Guns.com |location=Burnsville, MN}}</ref>\n\n====Jake Pinkman====\nJake Pinkman (played by Ben Petry) is Jesse's younger, over-achieving brother. Jesse accepts the blame for a joint belonging to Jake, which results in Jesse being thrown out of his parents' house. After apologizing to his brother, Jake asks for his joint back; Jesse responds by crushing it on the sidewalk and informing his brother that the marijuana is of poor quality anyway.\n\nIn ''El Camino'', when Jesse calls his parents he asks about Jake, and they tell Jesse that Jake is attending a band camp in [[London]].  When Jesse attempts to open his parents' safe, he correctly guesses that the combination corresponds to Jake's birthday.\n\n====Wendy====\nWendy (portrayed by Julia Minesci) is a meth-addicted street prostitute, who associates with Jesse Pinkman and is featured in the online promotional material as one of Saul Goodman's clients (as \"Wendy S.\"). She helps Jesse maintain an alibi and withstands an intense interrogation from Hank Schrader on Jesse's behalf. Recognizing her loyalty to him, Jesse tries to convince her to help him kill two drug dealers who convinced an 11-year-old boy to murder Combo on Gus's orders. She declines at first, fearing the repercussions, revealing that she has a son whom she needs to protect, but Jesse persuades her to help by drawing a comparison between the murdered boy and her own son. At the last moment, she is spared the ordeal by Mike, who intervenes to take Jesse to a meeting with the drug dealers.\n\nShe is the central character in the cold open of \u201c[[Half Measures]]\u201d where her name is a pun on the song \u201c[[Windy (The Association)|Windy]]\u201d by [[The Association]], which plays in the background.\n\n===Associates of Saul Goodman===\n==== Ernesto ====\nErnesto (portrayed by Brandon K.

Hired more for his size and [[pickpocket]]ing skills than his intelligence, he has a condition approximating [[narcolepsy]] (e.g., he falls asleep at odd times, such as when standing up or while on security detail), and has digestive problems that keep him from being as stoic as Saul would like.<ref>{{cite news|author=Breaking Bad Roundtable|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2013/08/-em-breaking-bad-em-was-jesses-big-epiphany-believable/279017/|date=August 25, 2013|work=The Atlantic|title=Breaking Bad: Was Jesse's Big Epiphany Believable?

Our roundtable discusses \"Confessions,\" the third episode in the AMC show's final half-season.}}</ref> Jimmy McGill hires Huell to plant a cell phone battery in Chuck's pocket as part of Jimmy's defense strategy to discredit Chuck's mental health. Jimmy later hires Huell to serve as a bodyguard while Jimmy conducts his business re-selling pre-paid cellular phones. Huell inadvertently assaults a police officer while protecting Jimmy, and is arrested and faces up to two and a half years in prison as a result. As Jimmy is still disbarred for another month, he brings in Kim Wexler to defend Huell, who plans to jump bail and flee rather than go to prison. To get Huell out of trouble, Jimmy and Kim pull a con on the ADA. The con succeeds in forcing the ADA to accept a plea deal to a lesser misdemeanor, a plea that gets Huell four months probation and time served, ensuring that he does not have to go to prison.\n\nHuell and Kuby were sent to intimidate Ted Beneke into paying his IRS debts with the money Skyler gave him, with no intent of actual violence, but Ted's fall while attempting to flee caused a severe neck injury that resulted in his [[tetraplegia]]. In \"Buried\", Saul sends Huell and Kuby to collect Walt's money from a storage locker, and in \"Confessions\", Saul tasks Huell with pickpocketing Jesse's marijuana so Jesse will not be high when he contacts Saul's \"disappearer\" for a new identity.  It is while Jesse is waiting for the disapperer that he realizes his marijuana is gone and comprehends that Huell had earlier pickpocketed from him the ricin cigarette that Walt had intended for Jesse to use in killing Gus. Jesse's realization that Huell stole the ricin cigarette enables him to understand that Walt must have poisoned Brock in order to turn Jesse against Gus (which turns out to be true, although he did not use the ricin extract for that purpose).\n\nHank and Gomez later interrogate Huell to learn where Walt hid his money, telling him falsely that Walt intends to kill him to ensure that no one can trace Walt's drug-dealing past. They use a staged photo of Jesse, who appears to have been killed with a gunshot to the head, to coax Huell into revealing that he and Kuby packed Walt's money into seven barrels, then loaded the barrels into a rented van. Huell also reveals that the van was so dirty on the outside when Walt returned that they washed it before returning it, implying that Walt's money was buried somewhere in the desert. Hank and Gomez tell Huell to wait until they come back for him, but they are killed and never return, so his fate remains unknown.\n\nDays before the release of ''[[El Camino: A Breaking Bad Movie]]'', a countdown was shared on ''Breaking Bad's'' social media channels. Throughout the countdown, multiple videos were shown of Huell still sitting impatiently in the safehouse, watching the events of \"[[Felina (Breaking Bad)|Felina]]\" on the news.<ref name=\"bustle char\">{{cite web |url=https://www.bustle.com/p/the-el-camino-cast-is-full-of-your-breaking-bad-faves-19198419 |title=The 'El Camino' Cast Is Full Of Your 'Breaking Bad' Faves |last=Gallagher |first=Caitlin |date=October 10, 2019 |website=Bustle |access-date=October 16, 2019}}</ref> Upon the countdown's conclusion, another video was shown of Huell, tired of waiting, putting on his jacket and eventually leaving the safehouse on his own accord as the title credits of ''El Camino'' appear on his television.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.insider.com/breaking-bad-movie-cast-members-who-returned-el-camino-2019-10 |title=12 'Breaking Bad' stars who returned for Netflix's sequel movie 'El Camino' |last=Singh |first=Olivia |date=October 11, 2019 |website=Insider |access-date=October 16, 2019}}</ref>  Though Huell did not appear in the film, it is humorously implied, through this [[breaking the fourth wall]] moment, that the length of time he waited for Hank and Gomez to return was long enough for the film to air.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.theringer.com/movies/2019/10/15/20914631/el-camino-netflix-cameos-ranked-breaking-bad-better-call-saul |title=Ranking the Cameos From 'Breaking Bad' and 'Better Call Saul' in 'El Camino'  |last=McNear |first=Claire |quote=\"One of Breaking Bad fans\u2019 favorite mysteries\u2014did Huell ever make it out of the safe house, given that the guys who were supposed to come get him, Hank and Gomez, were killed before they could?\u2014finally got an answer in a promo for the movie.\" |date=October 15, 2019 |website=[[The Ringer (website)|The Ringer]] |access-date=October 25, 2019}}</ref>\n\n====Ed Galbraith====\nEd Galbraith (played by [[Robert Forster]]) is an associate of Saul Goodman who specializes in providing criminals new identities and new places to live. His legitimate side business is as a vacuum salesman and repairman. Ed helps Saul escape to [[Omaha, Nebraska]].<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/live-feed/better-call-saul-opening-scene-771227 | work=The Hollywood Reporter | title='Better Call Saul' Opening Scene Explained | date=February 8, 2015}}</ref>\n\nIn \"[[Granite State (Breaking Bad)|Granite State]]\" Ed takes Walter White to [[New Hampshire]], hiding him away in a cabin in a rural area. During Walt's time in hiding, Ed often visits Walt, bringing him supplies and chemotherapy, though he warns that if Walt leaves the location, their business relationship will be over for good. A lonely Walt also takes to paying Ed to spend time with him and play cards.\n\nIn ''El Camino'', Jesse approaches Ed for relocation. Ed demands $125,000 to aid Jesse, plus $125,000 for the previous occasion Jesse was supposed to use his services, but failed to appear (depicted in the ''Breaking Bad'' episode \"[[Confessions (Breaking Bad)|Confessions]]\"). Jesse is $1,800 short and Ed refuses to help. After Jesse obtains the money, Ed smuggles him to a car parked near [[Haines, Alaska]] and provides him with false identification documents and a cover story. Jesse gives Ed a farewell letter for Brock Cantillo, which Ed promises to mail from [[Mexico City]] in the near future, wishing Jesse luck on his new life and noting that not many people like them get a fresh start.\n\nIn ''[[Better Call Saul]]'', in the flashforward at the beginning of [[Better Call Saul (season 5)|season 5's]] \"Magic Man,\" (presumably set after the events of ''El Camino'') Saul calls Ed for a second extraction after a cab driver named Jeff recognizes him. Ed recognizes Saul and agrees to a second extraction, warning that it will cost him double. Saul agrees and Ed sets the extraction at 7:00am on Thursday at the same place he dropped Saul off. After a moment of consideration, Saul changes his mind and tells Ed that he will \"fix it myself\" instead.\n\nRobert Forster's appearances as Ed in ''El Camino'' and ''Better Call Saul'' was his final role.  He died of [[brain cancer]] on October 11, 2019, the same day the movie was released, though he appeared in ''Better Call Saul'' as Ed posthumously. Ed is one of only two characters to appear in ''[[Breaking Bad]]'', ''[[Better Call Saul]]'', and ''[[El Camino: A Breaking Bad Movie|El Camino]]'', along with [[Mike Ehrmantraut]]. The ''Better Call Saul'' episode \"Magic Man\" was dedicated to Robert Forster.\n\n====Francesca Liddy====\nFrancesca Liddy (played by [[Tina Parker]]) is Saul Goodman's outspoken receptionist and secretary. Originally hired at the Wexler-McGill law firm, she continued to work for Jimmy when he re-branded himself as Saul.\n\n==== {{anchor|Kuby}}Patrick Kuby ====\nPatrick Kuby (played by [[Bill Burr]]) is one of Saul Goodman's hired hands. He assists in facilitating the [[Open House (Breaking Bad)|car wash sale]] to the Whites by impersonating an environmental inspector, and later [[Crawl Space (Breaking Bad)|intimidates Ted Beneke]] with Huell's help. He also aids Walt, Jesse, and Mike in their [[Dead Freight|train robbery]] and helps Huell [[Buried (Breaking Bad)|collect Walt's money from storage]].

When Walt had to leave class to vomit (a consequence of his chemotherapy), Hugo comforted him and cleaned up after him. After the DEA connects missing school equipment to methamphetamine production, Hugo is one of the initial suspects because of the access his custodial duties afford him. Hugo is soon placed under arrest for possession of marijuana and fired; after a search of his home, more marijuana is found but no methamphetamine or items that could connect him with the meth investigation.\n\n==== Ted Beneke ====\nTed Beneke (played by [[Christopher Cousins]]) is the president and owner of Beneke Fabricators. He gives Skyler back her old job back as his accountant during the second season. Ted has always been attracted to Skyler but does not make any advances after she returns. Ted commits [[tax fraud]] to keep the company alive and save everyone's jobs, which he admits to Skyler when she finds irregularities in the company's books. Skyler has an affair with Ted in season three to exact revenge against Walt, but ignores Ted's offer to leave some of her things at his house. When Walt finds out about their affair, he tries to confront Ted, who hides in his office. This escalates into a scene where Walt is escorted out by security guards and the company staff becomes aware of Skyler's relationship with Ted. Skyler gets angry at Ted when he shows up at her house to ask about their relationship, and she later severs both her personal and professional ties with him.\n\nIn season 4, Ted meets with Skyler, who is now running a car wash, and notifies her of an [[Internal Revenue Service]] (IRS) investigation into his company's taxes.<ref name=\"IGN\">{{cite news |date=July 18, 2012 |title=Breaking Bad Wiki Guide: Ted Beneke |url=https://www.ign.com/wikis/breaking-bad/Ted_Beneke |work=IGN |location=San Francisco, CA}}</ref> Since Skyler kept the books, she can be linked to Ted's tax fraud, likely placing her entire family under surveillance, so she intervenes by pretending at Ted's meeting with the IRS to be an unqualified bookkeeper hired only for her looks.<ref name=\"IGN\" />  Her supposed incompetence forestalls a full investigation, provided Ted pays the back taxes and penalties.<ref name=\"IGN\" />  Skyler arranges to provide Ted the money by using the proceeds from Walt's meth production to have Saul pretend a long-lost dead relative in Luxembourg left Ted an inheritance.<ref name=\"IGN\" />  Saul discovers that instead of paying the IRS, Ted leased a new Mercedes and is using the funds to reopen his business.<ref name=\"IGN\" />  When Skyler urges Ted to pay the IRS first, he refuses, so Skyler tells him the money came from her.<ref name=\"IGN\" />  Ted still refuses to pay the IRS and Skyler perceives him to be blackmailing her into paying both his tax bill and the costs to reopen his business.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.amc.com/shows/breaking-bad/cast-crew/ted-beneke |title=Character Biography: Ted Beneke |website=Breaking Bad Cast and Crew |publisher=[[AMC (TV channel)|AMC.com]] |location=New York, NY |access-date=November 9, 2019}}</ref> Skyler has Saul send two of his men\u2014[[List of Breaking Bad characters#Huell|Huell]] and [[List of Breaking Bad characters#Kuby|Kuby]]\u2014to force Beneke to write the check to the IRS.<ref name=\"IGN\" />  They succeed, but Ted panics and attempts to flee, tripping on a loose rug and crashing headfirst into a counter.<ref name=\"IGN\" />\n\nAt the start of the fifth season, Saul informs Skyler that something happened to Ted, causing her to conclude that he died.

When Jesse's RV quits running, Clovis charges him an exorbitant amount to tow and store the vehicle, due to its cargo. Clovis repairs the RV and catches Jesse sleeping in it after Jesse has scaled the fence (and destroyed a portable toilet in the process) after being evicted from his home. Clovis orders Jesse to pay for the repairs and property damage and then threatens to sell off Jesse's inventory to cover the repairs, when Jesse claims he cannot furnish immediate payment. Jesse again breaks into the gated lot and drives through the gate without paying for the repairs. He later returns to pay Clovis for the repairs and damages and arranges to store the RV inside Clovis' gated lot for $500 per week. Clovis later sells Jesse a used red [[Toyota Tercel]] hatchback. Jesse decides to retrieve the RV, but Walter has warned Clovis that the DEA is looking for it, forcing Clovis to bring it to a junkyard to be destroyed.\n\n==== Louis Corbett ====\nLouis Corbett (played by Kyle Swimmer and [[Caleb Landry Jones]]) is Walt Jr.'s best friend.

In ''[[El Camino: A Breaking Bad Movie]]'', Jesse contacts him in order to get rid of Todd's El Camino, which Joe agrees to do for free. However, Joe discovers that the police just activated the LoJack GPS tracker, causing him to flee, while advising Jesse, Skinny Pete and Badger to do the same thing.\n\n==== Group Leader ====\nThe Group Leader (played by [[Jere Burns]]) is a counselor who leads group therapy sessions at Narcotics Anonymous.

He takes a calm, non-judgmental approach to leading discussions and emphasizes that those attending his sessions are there not to improve themselves, but to learn self-acceptance. During an outdoor session at a campfire, he reveals to Jesse and other recovering addicts that in July 1992, while drunk on vodka and high on cocaine, he killed his six-year-old daughter by accidentally hitting her with his car. Jesse, still reeling from Jane's death, asks the Group Leader how can he not hate himself for what happened. The Group Leader responds that self-hatred and guilt stand in the way of achieving true change. The Group Leader is seen again in Season 4, when Jesse returns to a session distraught about killing Gale. During the session, Jesse breaks down and yells at the Group Leader, claiming that his philosophy about \"accepting yourself\" for making mistakes is wrong and people should be judged for the things they have done. Jesse then asks the Group Leader if he just accepts himself for killing his daughter and admits to the whole group that the only reason he comes to these meetings in the first place is to sell meth to them. He asks the Group Leader if he is okay with that, to which the group leader responds, \"No.\" Jesse retorts, \"About time,\" and leaves the session, never to return.\n\n==== Lawson ====\nLawson (played by [[Jim Beaver]]) is Walter White and Mike Ehrmantraut's gun dealer. He sold Walt a .38 caliber snub handgun (a [[Ruger LCR]]) with the serial number filed off,<ref name=\"Thirty-Eight Snub\">{{cite episode | title = Thirty-Eight Snub | episodelink = Thirty-Eight Snub | series = Breaking Bad | serieslink = Breaking Bad | credits = [[Michelle MacLaren]] (dir), [[George Mastras]] (wrt) | network = [[AMC (TV channel)|AMC]] | airdate = July 24, 2011 | season = 4 | number = 2}}</ref> and previously a sniper rifle which Mike intends to use in assassinating Don Hector Salamanca at a remote desert location. Walt purchases an [[M60 machine gun]] from Lawson in the restroom of a Denny's. After the purchase he gives Walt the keys to the car that has the M60 hidden in the trunk.<ref name=\"Live Free or Die\" />\n\n==== Donald Margolis ====\nDonald Margolis (played by [[John de Lancie]]) is [[Jane Margolis (Breaking Bad)|Jane]]'s father. He owns the building his daughter managed for him. He sent Jane to rehab once before and goes with her to recovery meetings. Donald becomes furious when he discovers that his daughter is back on heroin, suspecting Jesse is at fault (in fact, it is the other way around; she initiated Jesse to heroin, although they are both enabling each other). He nearly calls the police but relents when Jane promises to go back into rehab. Depressed, he goes to a bar and strikes up a conversation with a stranger about the heartache of raising children\u2014that stranger turns out to be Walter White, who has recently been blackmailed by Donald's daughter Jane, although he does not realize the coincidence at the moment. Donald's words inspire Walter to help Jesse get clean from heroin. Walt returns to Jesse's apartment and witnesses Jane choking to death on her vomit while intoxicated on heroin. Heartbroken, Donald is present when the [[paramedic]]s remove Jane's body and hardly reacts to Jesse's presence. A month later, he returns to work as an [[air traffic controller]] while still distraught and causes a mid-air collision of two airplanes just above Albuquerque. The collision kills 167 people\u2014which explains the recurring images in the Season 2 flash-forwards of a burned pink teddy bear floating in Walter's pool. Shortly after the incident, Walter hears via his in-car radio that Margolis is rushed to the hospital after a self-inflicted gunshot wound; however, Walt turns the radio off before Margolis' fate is revealed. Later on, in the episode \"[[Fly (Breaking Bad)|Fly]]\", Walter recalls that unlikely sequence of events, telling Jesse about the encounter at the bar (he only realized that this man was Jane's father after he saw him on the news following the disaster), and wonders about the possible meaning of the coincidence.\n\n==== Carmen Molina ====\nCarmen Molina (played by [[Carmen Serano]]) is the assistant principal at JP Wynne High School, where Walt teaches and which Walt Jr. attends. In Season 3, Walt makes an awkward pass at her (as an attempt at \"revenge\" for Skyler's infidelity with Ted), resulting in him being placed on an indefinite sabbatical.<ref name=\"Green Light\">{{cite episode | title = Green Light | episodelink = | series = Breaking Bad | serieslink = Breaking Bad | credits = [[Scott Winant]] (dir), [[Sam Catlin]] (wrt) | network = [[AMC (TV channel)|AMC]] | airdate = April 11, 2010 | season = 3 | number = 4}}</ref> In Season 5, she has been promoted to principal.<ref name=\"Granite State\">{{cite episode | title = Granite State | episodelink = Granite State (Breaking Bad) | series = Breaking Bad | serieslink = Breaking Bad | credits = [[Peter Gould (writer)|Peter Gould]] (dir, wrt) | network = [[AMC (TV channel)|AMC]] | airdate = September 22, 2013 | season = 5 | number = 15}}</ref>\n\n==== Pamela ====\nPamela (played by Julie Dretzin) is a divorce attorney hired by Skyler in the third season. Skyler confides in Pamela that Walter is a drug dealer, and Pamela urges her to contact the police.\n\n==== Gretchen and Elliott Schwartz ====\nGretchen Schwartz (played by [[Jessica Hecht]]) is Walt's former college chemistry assistant and now co-owner of Gray Matter, a successful [[pharmaceutical]] company. A former romantic interest of Walter's, she is married to Walter's former partner and friend, Elliott Schwartz (played by [[Adam Godley]]), who created Gray Matter alongside Walt. Gretchen discovers that Walter lied to his family, having told them she and Elliott are paying for his treatment, and is horrified when Walter angrily and bitterly blames her and Elliott for ruining his life. Although she claims that Walter sees it wrong, what actually transpired remains unknown except that Walter left her and his research behind suddenly and without explanation after Gretchen took him to her parents' home for the weekend. Out of pity for Walter, Gretchen later covers for him and states that she did help Walter out on the condition that she would deny it if asked by Skyler. She also adds that the two will no longer be able to continue to \"fund\" Walt's treatment. When told this, Walter spins another lie in which he claims that he met with Gretchen and learned that she and Elliott have gone broke due to the recession, and hence cut off their financial help. Later, after Skyler's suspicions of Walter having an affair with Gretchen are renewed, Skyler makes contact with Gretchen, who tells her they never paid for any of Walter's medical bills.\n\nIn the penultimate episode \"[[Granite State (Breaking Bad)|Granite State]]\", she is seen with Elliott on ''[[Charlie Rose (TV series)|Charlie Rose]]''. Walter sees the interview at a secluded bar in New Hampshire immediately after calling the DEA to turn himself in. Rose questions them about their association with Walter White, who is now tracked as a criminal. Elliott insists that Walter had nothing to do with the development of Gray Matter, aside from the name. Gretchen adds that the Walter White she knew, not \"Heisenberg,\" is gone. Walter, quietly furious while watching the interview, leaves the bar before the police arrive.\n\nIn the series' last episode, \"Felina,\" Walter forces Gretchen and Elliott to give the remainder of his money to Walt Jr. as a donation from their foundation, warning that two hitmen will kill them if they do not give the money to his son (using Badger and Skinny Pete to hold [[laser pointer]]s at them from outside, as if they were snipers training [[List of laser applications#Laser sight|laser sights]] on them).\n\n==== Rich Schweikart ====\nRichard Schweikart (played by [[Dennis Boutsikaris]]) is the co-founder of the Schweikart & Cokely law firm and Kim's boss.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.telegram.com/entertainment/20180910/jimmy-goes-gangster-as-better-call-saul-takes-breather |title=Jimmy Goes Gangster as Better Call Saul Takes a Breather |last=Guide |first=T.

In the opening scenes, Drew is on his motorcycle riding around the desert scrub. He finds a tarantula, which he places in a jar; he then hears a train coming down the tracks and sets off to see it, only to encounter [[Walter White (Breaking Bad)|Walter White]], [[Jesse Pinkman]], and [[Todd Alquist]] as they are celebrating their success in stealing the methylamine from the tanker car on the train [[List of Breaking Bad characters#Kuby|Kuby]] helped them stop. Walt, Jesse, and Todd turn off the engine to their pump and discover Drew and his motorcycle on the other side of the trestle. They wave hello to Drew, but Todd then pulls out his pistol and kills Drew in cold blood, to Jesse's  dismay.<ref name=\"Dead Freight\">{{cite episode | title = Dead Freight | episodelink = Dead Freight | series = Breaking Bad | serieslink = Breaking Bad | credits = [[George Mastras]] (dir, wrt) | network = [[AMC (TV channel)|AMC]] | airdate = August 12, 2012 | season = 5 | number = 5}}</ref>\n\nDrew's body and motorcycle are hauled back to Vamonos Pest in [[Albuquerque]], where Walter, Mike and Jesse dispose of them, once again using [[hydrofluoric acid]]. Todd keeps the tarantula in the jar. Later on in that episode, [[KOB]] Reporter Antoinette Antonio reports on the disappearance of Drew Sharp and how the search for Drew has now expanded beyond McKinley County.<ref name=\"Buyout\" /> The killing of Drew is a critical turning point for Jesse, who ultimately severs his ties with Walter's operation due to his horror and grief at the young boy's death. After Walter belatedly leaves Jesse his share of the buyout money, Jesse seeks [[Saul Goodman (Breaking Bad)|Saul Goodman]]'s help to send half of the $5 million to Drew's family, but is rebuffed as such a move would draw the attention of the authorities.<ref name=\"Blood Money\">{{cite episode | title = Blood Money | episodelink = Blood Money (Breaking Bad) | series = Breaking Bad | serieslink = Breaking Bad | credits = [[Bryan Cranston]] (dir), [[Peter Gould (writer)|Peter Gould]] (wrt) | network = [[AMC (TV channel)|AMC]] | airdate = August 11, 2013 | season = 5 | number = 9}}</ref> The murder of Drew is mentioned in the tape Hank and Gomez make of Jesse confessing to his and Walter's criminal history.\n\nIn ''[[El Camino: A Breaking Bad Movie]]'', it is revealed that Todd kept the tarantula at his apartment.\n\n==== Spooge ====\nSpooge (played by [[David Ury]]) is a drug addict who steals meth from Skinny Pete at knifepoint.<ref name=\"Breakage\">{{Cite episode |title=Breakage |series=Breaking Bad |network=[[AMC (TV channel)|AMC]] |season=2 |number=5 |serieslink=Breaking Bad |credits=[[Johan Renck]] (dir), [[Moira Walley-Beckett]] (wrt) |airdate=April 5, 2009}}</ref> Jesse later accosts Spooge in the latter's home as Jesse attempts to retrieve the stolen drugs or cash payment. Spooge attempts to repay Jesse by breaking open an ATM he has stolen from a convenience store. While attempting to drill into the machine from the bottom, he begins verbally abusing his girlfriend (played by [[Dale Dickey]]), who tips the ATM, crushing Spooge's head and killing him instantly. (For a short period, Jesse's associates and rivals attribute Spooge's death to Jesse, which strengthens his street credibility and reputation of ruthlessness, until the woman confesses to the murder.) Spooge had a son, whose neglect disturbs Jesse as he realizes the dreadful side effects of the drug business. Before leaving he calls 911 and leaves the phone line open to allow the police to trace the call, making sure that the boy will be taken care of, and instructs the boy not to go back inside the house.<ref name=\"Peekaboo\">{{Cite episode |title=Peekaboo |series=Breaking Bad |network=[[AMC (TV channel)|AMC]] |season=2 |number=6 |serieslink=Breaking Bad |credits=[[Peter Medak]] (dir), [[Vince Gilligan]], [[J.

Walt is not present for his daughter's birth because he is preoccupied with drug-related business, and he blames Jesse for making him miss the birth. Ted Beneke, Skyler's boss, takes Skyler to the hospital when she goes into labor. Skyler brings the baby on her trip to the [[Four Corners Monument]]. Holly is seen learning to walk in Season 5. Holly and her brother spend three months in the home of their Aunt Marie and Uncle Hank while their parents work to determine the state of their marriage. After her Uncle Hank's unexpected death, which causes a nasty fight between Walter and Skyler, Walter kidnaps Holly to \"punish\" Skyler for attempting to stab him, but later has second thoughts and leaves her at a fire station. She is later returned safely to Skyler. Holly's last appearance occurs in \"Felina\" where Walter, via a request that is granted by Skyler, holds and embraces her for a moment before he leaves.\n\n==== Bogdan Wolynetz ====\nBogdan Wolynetz (played by [[Marius Stan (actor)|Marius Stan]]) is the owner and proprietor of the [[car wash]] at which Walt is employed at the beginning of the series. He is abrasive and rude to Walter, who finds this job degrading and tedious. After Walt is diagnosed with lung cancer in the pilot episode, he angrily lashes out at Bogdan and quits.\n\nBogdan does not reappear until the third season, when Walt and Skyler are trying to purchase the car wash in order to launder Walt's drug money. When Skyler is trying to negotiate the purchase, Bogdan brings up Walt's angry outburst and states that, if Walt wants to purchase the establishment it will cost him $20 million. When Saul suggests that Walt and Skyler could accuse Bogdan of harboring [[Islamic extremism|Islamist]] terrorists in order to force him to sell the car wash, Walt exasperatedly reveals that Bogdan is, in fact, [[Romanians|Romanian]]. Eventually, Walt and Skyler are able to purchase it for $800,000 after Skyler hires [[#Kuby|Kuby]] to perform a fake environmental audit on the car wash.\n\nWhen Bogdan hands the keys to the building over to Walter, he taunts Walter by implying that he needs his \"woman\" to do things for him. Walter, having been riled up by Bogdan, refuses to let him leave with his first American business dollar which had been framed and mounted in his shop. Subsequently, Walter spends that dollar in the vending machine to buy a can of soda.\n\n==== Daniel Wormald ====\nDaniel Wormald (played by [[Mark Proksch]]), who uses the alias \"Pryce\", is a quirky and naive man who works for a pharmaceutical company, and decides to make extra money by selling stolen pills to a drug dealer ([[Nacho Varga]]). He considers hiring three bodyguards, including [[Mike Ehrmantraut]], but Mike disarms one and the other runs away.  When Nacho's payment is $20 short, Mike insists that he pay in full.  Mike reveals to Daniel that he researched Nacho and knows he is conducting deals without the knowledge of his bosses, giving him an incentive to make sure things go smoothly.  After a few successful transactions, Daniel and Mike disagree over the risks Daniel is taking, including showing off with a flashy new [[Hummer]].  He dismisses Mike and deals with Nacho alone, enabling Nacho to learn his real identity.  Nacho breaks into Daniel's house and steals back the money he paid Daniel, along with a valuable baseball card collection.   Daniel calls the police, who find an empty hiding place inside a wall of his home.  To keep Daniel from talking to police, Mike offers to retrieve the baseball cards.  Mike then brokers a deal that has Daniel receive his baseball cards and $10,000 in exchange for the Hummer.  Mike requests that [[Saul Goodman|Jimmy McGill]] represent Daniel when suspicious police attempt to interview him again.  Jimmy convincingly explains away Daniel's hiding place as the location of fetish videos stolen by a jealous lover, including presenting a faked video of Daniel performing the act in question\u2014sitting on pies.  Police end their investigation and when Jimmy brags to [[Kim Wexler]] about his success, she chastises him for fabricating evidence. Nacho later breaks into Daniel's house again to request Daniel's aid in procuring empty capsules that look like [[Hector Salamanca]]'s [[angina]] medication, for which Nacho offers $20,000.  Daniel asks Mike for assistance and Mike refuses, but later reconsiders and takes part in the deal.  Nacho tells Mike his plan is to switch Hector's medication for a placebo in the hopes of inducing a fatal heart attack.  Mike tells Nacho that if Hector dies, Nacho should immediately replace the placebos with the real medication so that the cause of Hector's death will not be obvious.\n\n==== Werner Ziegler ====\nWerner Ziegler (played by [[Rainer Bock]]) is a German construction engineer hired by Gustavo Fring to build his underground methamphetamine laboratory. After vetting by Mike Ehrmantraut, Gus chooses Werner over an overly confident French engineer because of his awareness and frank explanation of the difficulties involved in the construction. When it becomes clear that the job will take longer than anticipated and tempers flare among Werner's crew, Mike arranges an \"[[R&R (military)|R&R]]\" outing to a strip club. Mike and Werner retire to a quiet bar for a personal conversation, but Mike has to return to the strip club to smooth over an altercation, and during his absence Werner drunkenly reveals construction details to other patrons at the bar. Werner later requests a weekend off to visit with his wife, which Mike denies. Werner then escapes by bypassing the security system where his crew and he are quartered. According to the note he left behind, he plans to visit with his wife and then return to finish the work. Mike tracks Werner down at a local spa, but so does [[List of Breaking Bad and Better Call Saul characters#Eduardo \"Lalo\" Salamanca|Eduardo \"Lalo\" Salamanca]], to whom Werner mistakenly reveals construction details before Mike ends the call. Mike asks Gus to let Werner return to work, but Gus understands that through Werner Lalo could learn the secret of the meth lab's construction, so he says he will send men to kill Werner. Mike says he will do it himself and convinces Werner to contact his wife at the airport and send her home. He promises that Werner's death will have an explanation that satisfies the authorities, so that his wife will not wonder what happened to him, and to return Werner's crew to Germany unharmed. Werner tells Mike he wants to take a last walk to look at the stars, and Mike follows and shoots him in the head.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{Breaking Bad}}\n{{Better Call Saul}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Breaking Bad Characters}}\n[[Category:Breaking Bad characters| ]]\n[[Category:Better Call Saul characters| ]]\n[[Category:Lists of American crime television series characters]]\n[[Category:Lists of American drama television series characters]]\n", "name_user": "SergeantBash", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eSteven Gomez:Update to reflect the events of season 5 of Better Call Saul.", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Breaking_Bad_and_Better_Call_Saul_characters"}

Teams must make a boat entirely out of materials provided for them (bamboo, sheet plastic, twine, and duct tape) and race it in a small loop on the St. Mary's River by the college boathouse and docks. The bamboo is harvested from the campus bamboo forest, where it is considered an invasive species. There are cash prizes for the winners. This event replaced The Great Cardboard Boat Race (an earlier incarnation using cardboard instead of bamboo) in 2010. \n*The Mardi Gras Parade, a senior tradition, where students parade around campus on the night of Mardi Gras to the beat of pots and pans.\n* World Carnival Weekend takes place late in the Spring semester.

An Occasional 40 will be bought and spray painted gold, known as a Golden 40.\n* May Day Bicycle Streak: On May 1 (May Day) students streak through campus on bicycles. This represents freedom, especially for seniors. Clothed students stand on the sidelines and \"offer support\". \n* Wednesday night Hide-A-Keg: On balmy Wednesday nights, a keg would be hidden somewhere on campus. First observed in 1988, the hunt would start (for both students and campus security) with a ringing of the bell. This tradition is no longer practiced, as kegs were banned on campus in the interest of student safety.\n* Friction Fest: Every April the SMCM Rock Climbing Club sponsors a huge Bouldering (rock climbing) competition called \"Friction Fest\" which is free and open to both students, staff, faculty, community and the local Navy Base members.}}\n\n===Seven Wonders===\nThe Seven Wonders are seven notable campus landmarks.  New students are inducted into the traditions of SMCM by orientation leaders in a tour of the Seven Wonders during orientation and it is a graduation tradition for the departing class to tour the seven wonders and recount stories the evening before graduation. Thus a student's time at SMCM begins and ends with tours of the Seven Wonders.\n\nThe seven \"wonders\" are:\n# The Shoe Tree (see above)\n# The Bell Tower \n# A clearing on St. John's Pond on the Side of Queen Ann (see above)\n# Maryland Freedom of Conscience Statue on Route 5 (a.k.a.
