He was [[Chief of the General Staff (United Kingdom)|Chief of the Imperial General Staff]] (CIGS), the professional head of the British Army, during the [[Second World War]], and was promoted to field marshal in 1944. As chairman of the [[Chiefs of Staff Committee]], Brooke was the foremost military advisor to [[Winston Churchill]], the [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|British Prime Minister]], and had the role of co-ordinator of the [[Military history of the United Kingdom during World War II|British military efforts]] in the [[Allies of World War II|Allies]]' victory in 1945. After retiring from the British Army, he served as [[Lord High Constable of England]] during the [[Coronation of Queen Elizabeth II|Coronation]] of [[Elizabeth II|Queen Elizabeth II]] in 1953. His war diaries attracted attention for their criticism of Churchill and for Brooke's forthright views on other leading figures of the war.\n\n==Background and early life==\nAlan Brooke was born in 1883 at [[Bagn\u00e8res-de-Bigorre]], Hautes-Pyr\u00e9n\u00e9es, to a prominent [[Anglo-Irish]] family from West [[Ulster]] in Ireland with a long military tradition as the ''Fighting Brookes of Colebrooke''.<ref>{{Harvtxt|Roberts|2008}}, p 12\u201313.</ref> He was the seventh and youngest child of [[Victor Brooke|Sir Victor Brooke, 3rd Baronet]], of Colebrooke Park, [[Brookeborough]], [[County Fermanagh]], [[Ulster]], [[Ireland]], and the former Alice Bellingham, second daughter of [[Bellingham baronets|Sir Alan Bellingham, 3rd Baronet]], of Castle Bellingham in [[County Louth]].<ref>{{Harvtxt|Roberts|2008}}, p 12.</ref> Brooke was educated at a day school in [[Pau, Pyr\u00e9n\u00e9es-Atlantiques|Pau]], France, where he lived until the age of 16; he was bi-lingual in French (which he spoke with a heavy Gascon accent) and English.<ref>{{Harvtxt|Roberts|2008}}, p 14.</ref> He spoke both French and English very fast, leading some Americans to distrust a ''fast-talking Limey''. {{sfn|Roberts|2009|pp=14,46}} He was also fluent in German, and had learnt Urdu and Persian.<ref name=\"Fraser 1982 pp.41,44,51\">{{Harvtxt|Fraser|1982}}, pp.41,44,51.</ref>\n\nHe \"only just\" qualified for the [[Royal Military Academy, Woolwich|Royal Military Academy at Woolwich]], coming sixty-fifth out of seventy-two in the entrance exam, but passed out at seventeenth. Had he done any better he would have qualified for a commission in the Royal Engineers and probably would not have ended up on the General Staff after the \"Great War\", showing that initial lack of success could be invaluable later on.{{sfn|Roberts|2009|p=14}}\n\nSo Brooke was, on 24 December 1902, commissioned into the [[Royal Artillery|Royal Regiment of Artillery]] as a [[second lieutenant]].<ref>{{London Gazette|issue=27528|page=1216|date=24 February 1903}}</ref> During the [[First World War]], he served with the [[Royal Artillery]] in France where he gained a reputation as an outstanding planner of operations. At the [[Battle of the Somme]] in 1916, he introduced the French \"[[creeping barrage]]\" system, thereby helping the protection of the advancing infantry from enemy machine gun fire.<ref name=\"Fraser 1982 pp.72-73\">{{Harvtxt|Fraser|1982}}, pp.72\u201373.</ref> Brooke was with the [[Canadian Corps]] from early 1917 and planned the barrages for the [[Battle of Vimy Ridge]]. In 1918 he was appointed GSO1 as the senior artillery staff officer in the First Army.<ref>''Vimy Ridge: A Canadian Reassessment'' edited by Geoff Hayes p98-99</ref> Brooke ended the conflict as a [[Lieutenant colonel (United Kingdom)|lieutenant-colonel]] with the [[Distinguished Service Order]] and [[Medal bar|Bar]].<ref name=\"DSO1\"/><ref name=\"DSO2\"/>\n\nBetween the wars, he was a lecturer at the [[Staff College, Camberley]] and the [[Imperial Defence College]], where Brooke knew most of those who became leading British commanders of the [[Second World War]]. From the mid-1930s Brooke held a number of important appointments: Inspector of Artillery, Director of Military Training and then [[General Officer Commanding|GOC]] of the [[1st (United Kingdom) Division|Mobile Division]]. In 1938, on promotion to [[Lieutenant-general (United Kingdom)|lieutenant-general]] he took command of the Anti-Aircraft Corps (renamed [[Anti-Aircraft Command]] in April 1939) and built a strong relationship with Air Marshal [[Hugh Dowding]], the AOC-in-C of [[Fighter Command]], which laid a vital basis of co-operation between the two commands during the [[Battle of Britain]]. In July 1939 Brooke moved to command [[Southern Command (United Kingdom)|Southern Command]]. By the outbreak of the [[Second World War]], Brooke was already seen as one of the British Army's foremost generals.<ref>{{Harvtxt|Mead|2007}}, p. 78.</ref>\n\n==Second World War==\n===Commander in Flanders, France and Britain===\nFollowing the outbreak of the Second World War, in September 1939, Brooke commanded [[II Corps (United Kingdom)|II Corps]] in the [[British Expeditionary Force (World War II)|British Expeditionary Force]] (BEF)\u2014which included in its subordinate formations the [[3rd Division (United Kingdom)|3rd Infantry Division]], commanded by the then Major-General [[Bernard Montgomery]], as well as Major-General [[Dudley Graham Johnson|Dudley Johnson]]'s [[4th Infantry Division (United Kingdom)|4th Infantry Division]]. As corps commander, Brooke had a pessimistic view of the [[Allies of World War II|Allies]]' chances of countering a German offensive. He was sceptical of the quality and determination of the [[French Army]], and of the [[Belgian Army]]. This scepticism appeared to be justified when he was on a visit to some French front-line units; and was shocked to see unshaven men, ungroomed horses and dirty vehicles.<ref>Reagan, Geoffrey.

Gort, on the other hand, regarded Brooke as a pessimist who failed to spread confidence, and was thinking of replacing him.<ref>{{Harvtxt|Fraser|1982}}, pp. 135\u2013140.</ref>\n\n[[File:The British Army in France 1940 F4134.jpg|thumb|right|Lieutenant-General Sir Alan Brooke sits for a portrait being painted by [[Reginald Eves]], 30 April 1940.]]\n\nWhen the [[Battle of France|German offensive]] began Brooke, aided by [[Neil Ritchie]], his Brigadier General Staff (BGS), distinguished himself in the handling of the British forces in the [[Battle of Dunkirk|retreat to Dunkirk]]. In late May 1940 II Corps held the major German attack on the Ypres-Comine Canal but then found its left flank exposed by the capitulation of the [[Belgian Army#World War II|Belgian army]]. Brooke swiftly ordered Montgomery's 3rd Division to switch from the Corps' right flank to cover the gap. This was accomplished in a complicated night-time manoeuvre. Pushing more troops north to counter the threat to the embarking troops at Dunkirk from German units advancing along the coast, II Corps retreated to their appointed places on the east or south-east of the shrinking perimeter of Dunkirk.<ref name=\"auto\">{{Harvtxt|Mead|2007}}, pp. 78\u201379.</ref>\n\n[[File:The British Army in the United Kingdom 1939-45 H6512.jpg|thumb|left|General Sir Alan Brooke, C-in-C Home Forces (fifth from right, facing camera) inspecting a [[Tetrarch tank|Light Tank Mk VII \"Tetrarch\"]] at the [[Staff College, Camberley]], 6 January 1941.]]\n\nThen on 29 May Brooke was ordered by Gort to return to England, leaving the Corps in Montgomery's hands.<ref name=\"auto\"/> According to Montgomery, Brooke was so overcome with emotion at having to leave his men in such a crisis that \"he broke down and wept\" as he handed over to Monty on the beaches of La Panne.<ref>{{Harvtxt|Caddick-Adams|2012}}, p. 235.</ref> He was told by Gort to ''proceed home ... for (the) task of reforming new armies'' and so returned on a destroyer (30 May). Then ''on June 2nd set out for the War Office to find out what I was wanted for'' with a ''light heart'' and with no responsibility, and was then told by [[John Dill|Dill]] (CIGS) that he was to ''Return to France to form a new BEF''; he later said that hearing the command from Dill was ''one of his blackest (moments) in the war''. He had already realised that there was no hope of success for the ''Brittany plan'' ([[Operation Ariel#Breton redoubt|Breton redoubt]]) to keep an allied redoubt in France. He told the Secretary for War ([[Anthony Eden|Eden]]) that the mission had ''no military value and no hope of success'' although he could not comment on its political value.<ref>{{Harvtxt|Fraser|1982}}, pp.163-167.</ref> In his first conversation with Prime Minister [[Winston Churchill]] (Brooke had been rung by Dill who was at 10 Downing Street) he insisted that all British forces should be withdrawn from France. Churchill initially objected but was eventually convinced by Brooke and around 200,000 British and Allied troops were successfully evacuated from ports in northwestern France.<ref name=\"Fraser 1982 pp.72-73\"/><ref>Brooke, p. 2 in {{London Gazette|issue=37573 |supp=y|page=2434|date=21 May 1946 }}</ref><ref>{{Harvtxt|Alanbrooke|2001}}, entres 29 May & 14 June 1940.</ref><ref>{{Harvtxt|Hastings|2009}}, pp. 51\u201353.</ref>\n\n[[File:The British Army in the United Kingdom 1939-45 H14377.jpg|thumb|right|Senior officers discuss operations during Exercise 'Bumper', 2 October 1941.

Thus it would have been Brooke's task to direct the land battle in the event of [[Operation Sea Lion|German landings]]. Contrary to his predecessor General [[Edmund Ironside, 1st Baron Ironside|Sir Edmund Ironside]], who favoured a static coastal defence, Brooke focused on developing a mobile reserve which was to swiftly counterattack the enemy forces before they were established. A light line of defence on the coast was to assure that the landings were delayed as much as possible. Writing after the war, Brooke acknowledged that he also \"had every intention of using sprayed [[mustard gas]] on the beaches\".<ref>{{Harvtxt|Alanbrooke|2001}}, entry 22 July 1940.</ref><ref>{{Harvtxt|Fraser|1982}}, pp.172\u2013186.</ref>\n\nBrooke believed that the lack of a unified command of the three services was \"a grave danger\" to the defence of the country. Despite this, and the fact that the available forces never reached the numbers he thought were required, Brooke considered the situation far from \"helpless\" in case the Germans invaded. \"We should certainly have a desperate struggle and the future might well have hung in the balance, but I certainly felt that given a fair share of the fortunes of war we should certainly succeed in finally defending these shores\", he wrote after the war.<ref>{{Harvtxt|Alanbrooke|2001}}, entries for 29 July and 15 September 1940.</ref><ref>{{Harvtxt|Fraser|1982}}, pp.178\u2013184.</ref> But in the end, the [[Operation Sea Lion|German invasion plan]] was never taken beyond the preliminary assembly of forces.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/history/worldwars/wwtwo/invasion_ww2_01.shtml |title=History \u2013 World Wars: The German Threat to Britain in World War Two |publisher=BBC |date= |accessdate=2012-10-14}}</ref>\n\n===Chief of the Imperial General Staff===\nIn December 1941 Brooke succeeded [[Field marshal (United Kingdom)|Field Marshal]] [[John Dill|Sir John Dill]] as [[Chief of the General Staff (United Kingdom)|Chief of the Imperial General Staff]] (CIGS), the professional head of the British Army,<ref>{{London Gazette| issue=35397|page=7369|date=26 December 1941| supp=y}}</ref> in which appointment he also represented the British Army on the [[Chiefs of Staff Committee]].

As CIGS, Brooke was the functional head of the British Army, and as chairman of the Chiefs of Staff Committee, which he dominated by force of intellect and personality, he took the leading military part in the overall strategic direction of the British war effort. In 1942, Brooke joined the [[Allies of World War II|Western Allies]]' ultimate command, the U.S.-British [[Combined Chiefs of Staff]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.kingscollections.org/catalogues/lhcma/collection/a/br60-001/|title=Alanbrooke, FM Alan Francis, 1st Viscount Alanbrooke of Brookeborough (1883\u20131963)|publisher=[[Liddell Hart Military Archives]]|accessdate=10 March 2016}}</ref> \nBrooke was responsible for commanding the entire British Army; he focused on grand strategy, and his relationships, through the Combined Chiefs of Staff, with his American counterparts.  He was also responsible for the appointment and evaluation of senior commanders, allocation of manpower and equipment and the organization of tactical air forces in support of land operations of field commanders. In addition he had primary responsibility for supervising the military operations of the Free French, Polish, Dutch, Belgian, and Czech units reporting to their governments in exile in London.  Brooke vigorously allocated responsibilities to his deputies. Despite the traditional historical distrust that had existed between the military and the political side of the War Office, he got along quite well with his counterpart, the [[Secretary of State for War]], first the Conservative politicians [[David Margesson, 1st Viscount Margesson|David Margesson]] and later Sir [[James Grigg]], a former civil servant in the department. <ref>Andrew Roberts, ''Masters and Commanders: How Four Titans Won the War in the West, 1941-1945'' (2010) pp 61-62.</ref>\n\n[[File:Brooke - Churchill - Montgomery.jpg|275px|thumb|upright|right|Brooke (on the left) and [[Winston Churchill|Churchill]] visit [[Bernard Montgomery]]'s mobile headquarters in [[Normandy]], [[France]], 12 June 1944.]]\n\nBrooke's focus was primarily on the [[Mediterranean and Middle East theatre of World War II|Mediterranean Theatre of Operations]]. Here, his key issues were to rid [[North African Campaign|North Africa]] of [[Axis powers|Axis forces]] and knock Italy out of the war, thereby opening up the Mediterranean for Allied shipping, and then mount the cross channel invasion when the Allies were ready and the Germans sufficiently weakened.<ref>{{Harvtxt|Alanbrooke|2001}}, entry 17 July 1942.</ref>\n\nBrooke's and the British view of the Mediterranean operations contrasted with the American commitment to an [[Operation Roundup (1942)|early invasion of western Europe]], which led to several heated arguments at the many conferences of the Combined Chiefs of Staff.<ref name=historynet>{{cite web|url=http://www.historynet.com/what-if-the-allies-had-invaded-france-in-1943.htm|title=What If the Allies Had Invaded France in 1943?|publisher=History.net|accessdate=10 March 2016}}</ref>\n\nDuring the first years of the Anglo-American alliance, it was often the British who got their way. At the London Conference in April 1942, Brooke and Churchill seem to have misled [[General (United States)|General]] [[George Marshall]], the [[Chief of Staff of the United States Army|U.S. Army Chief of Staff]], about the British intentions on an early landing in France. At the [[Casablanca Conference]] in January 1943, it was decided that the Allies should [[Allied invasion of Sicily|invade Sicily]], under the command of [[General (United States)|General]] [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]], a decision that effectively postponed the planned invasion of Western Europe until 1944. The Casablanca agreement was in fact a compromise, brokered largely by Brooke's old friend Field Marshal Sir [[John Dill]], Chief of the British Joint Staff Mission in [[Washington, D.C.|Washington DC]]. \"I owe him [Dill] an unbounded debt of gratitude for his help on that occasion and in many other similar ones\", Brooke wrote after the war.<ref>{{Harvtxt|Alanbrooke|2001}}, entry 18 January 1943</ref>\n\nThe post of CIGS was less rewarding than command in an important theatre of war but the CIGS chose the generals who commanded those theatres and decided what men and munitions they should have. When it came to finding the right commanders he often complained that many officers who would have been good commanders had been killed in the First World War and that this was one reason behind the difficulties the British had in the beginning of the war.<ref>{{Harvtxt|Alanbrooke|2001}}, entry 8 October 1941.</ref> When [[General (United Kingdom)|General]] [[Claude Auchinleck|Sir Claude Auchinleck]] was to be replaced as the commander of the [[Eighth Army (United Kingdom)|British Eighth Army]] in 1942, Brooke preferred [[Lieutenant-general (United Kingdom)|Lieutenant-General]] [[Bernard Montgomery]] instead of Lieutenant General [[William Gott]], who was Churchill's candidate. Soon thereafter Gott was killed in an air crash and Montgomery received the command. Brooke would later reflect upon the tragic event which led to the appointment of Montgomery as an intervention by God.<ref>{{Harvtxt|Alanbrooke|2001}}, entry 7 August 1942</ref> Earlier in 1942 Brooke had been offered the command of British forces in the Middle East. Brooke declined, believing he now knew better than any other general how to deal with Churchill.<ref>{{Harvtxt|Alanbrooke|2001}}, entry 6 August 1942</ref>\n\n[[File:The British Army in Italy 1943 NA9857.jpg|thumb|left|[[General (United Kingdom)|General]] [[Bernard Montgomery|Sir Bernard Montgomery]] in his staff car with General [[Harold Alexander, 1st Earl Alexander of Tunis|Sir Harold Alexander]] and General Sir Alan Brooke, during an inspection of the [[8th Infantry Division (India)|8th Indian Division]] HQ, Italy, 15 December 1943.]]\n\nA year later, the war had taken a different turn and Brooke no longer believed it necessary to stay at Churchill's side. He therefore looked forward to taking command of the [[Western Front (World War II)|Allied invasion of Western Europe]], a post Brooke believed he had been promised by Churchill on three occasions. During the [[Quebec Conference, 1943|first Quebec Conference]] in August 1943, it was decided that the command would go to General George Marshall. (Although in the event Marshall's work as U.S. Army Chief of Staff was too important for him to leave Washington DC and Dwight D. Eisenhower was appointed instead.) Brooke was bitterly disappointed, both at being passed over and of the way the decision was conveyed to him by Churchill, who according to Brooke \"dealt with the matter as if it were one of minor importance\".<ref>{{Harvtxt|Alanbrooke|2001}}, entry 15 August 1943.

He was quick in mind and speech and deeply respected by his military colleagues, both British and Allied, although his uncompromising style could make the Americans wary.<ref>{{Harvtxt|Fraser|1982}}, pp.525\u2013539.</ref>\n\nAs CIGS, Brooke had a strong influence on the grand strategy of the Western Allies. The war in the west unfolded more or less according to his plans, at least until 1943 when the [[United States Armed Forces|American forces]] still were relatively small in comparison to the British. Among the most crucial of his contributions was his opposition to an early landing in France, which was important for delaying [[Operation Overlord|Operation ''Overlord'']] until June 1944.<ref name=historynet/>\n\nHe was a cautious general with a great respect for the [[German Army (Wehrmacht)|German war machine]]. Some American planners thought that Brooke's participation in the campaigns of the First World War and in the two evacuations from France in the Second World War made him lack the aggression they believed necessary for victory.<ref>{{Harvtxt|Roberts|2008}}, p 140.</ref> According to [[Max Hastings]], Brooke's reputation as a strategist was \"significantly damaged\" by his remarks at the [[Washington Conference (1943)|Trident Conference]] in Washington in May 1943, where he claimed that no major operations on the continent would be possible until 1945 or 1946.<ref>{{Harvtxt|Hastings|2009}}, p 378\u2013379.</ref> His diary says that he wanted ''operations in the Mediterranean to force a dispersal of German forces, help Russia, and thus eventually produce a situation where cross Channel operations are possible'' but that Churchill ''entirely repudiated'' (or half repudiated) the paper we (the CCOS) had agreed on; Harry Hopkins got him to withdraw his proposed amendments but that Churchill had aroused suspicions with his talk of ''ventures in the Balkans.''<ref>{{Harvtxt|Alanbrooke|2001}}, entries for 24 & 25 May 1943</ref>\n\n===Relationship with Churchill===\nDuring the years as CIGS, Brooke had a stormy relationship with [[Winston Churchill]]. Brooke was often frustrated with the Prime Minister's habits and working methods, his abuse of generals and constant meddling in strategic matters. At the same time Brooke greatly admired Churchill for the way he inspired the Allied cause and for the way he bore the heavy burden of war leadership. In one typical passage in Brooke's war diaries Churchill is described as a \"genius mixed with an astonishing lack of vision \u2013 he is quite the most difficult man to work with that I have ever struck but I should not have missed the chance of working with him for anything on earth!\"<ref>{{Harvtxt|Alanbrooke|2001}}, entry for 30 August 1943.</ref>\n\nShortly after Pearl Harbor, Churchill and his senior military staff used the [[Arcadia Conference]] in Washington to decide the general strategy for the war. The American Army Chief of Staff [[George Marshall]] came up with the idea of a [[Combined Chiefs of Staff]] that would make final military decisions (subject to approval by  Roosevelt and Churchill). Marshall sold it to Roosevelt and together the two sold the idea to Churchill. Churchill's military aides were much less favorable, and Brooke was strongly opposed. However, Brooke was left behind in London to handle the daily details of running the British war effort, and was not consulted.  The combined board was permanently stationed in Washington, where Field Marshall [[John Dill]] represented the British half.  The Combined Board did have thirteen in-person full meetings, which Brooke attended.<ref>Andrew Roberts, ''Masters and Commanders: How Four Titans Won the War in the West, 1941-1945'' (2009) pp 66-101.</ref>\n\n[[File:Winston Churchill and his Chiefs of Staff around a conference table aboard SS QUEEN MARY en route to the USA, May 1943.

Prime Minister Churchill is presiding over the meeting at the end of the table.]]\n\nWhen Churchill's many fanciful strategic ideas collided with sound military strategy it was only Brooke on the Chiefs of Staff Committee who was able to stand up to the Prime Minister. Churchill said about Brooke: \"When I thump the table and push my face towards him what does he do? Thumps the table harder and glares back at me. I know these Brookes \u2013 stiff-necked [[Ulster]]men and there's no one worse to deal with than that!\"<ref>{{cite book|author=Winston S.

The CIGS was sceptical about the British intervention in the [[Greek Civil War]] in late 1944 (during the ''[[Dekemvriana]]''), believing this was an operation which would drain troops from the [[Western Front (World War II)|central front in Germany]]. But at this stage the war was practically won and Churchill saw the possibility of preventing Greece from becoming a communist state.<ref>{{Harvtxt|Fraser|1982}}, pp. 471\u2013473.</ref>\n\nThe balance of the Chiefs of Staff Committee was tilted in October 1943 when [[Dudley Pound|Admiral Sir Dudley Pound]], Brooke's predecessor as chairman, retired as a result of poor health and Admiral [[Andrew Cunningham, 1st Viscount Cunningham of Hyndhope|Sir Andrew Cunningham]] succeeded Pound as [[First Sea Lord]] and naval representative on the Chiefs of Staff Committee. Brooke as a consequence got a firm ally in his arguments with Churchill.<ref>{{Harvtxt|Reynolds|2005}}, p. 405.</ref> This was reflected in the most serious clash between the Prime Minister and the Chiefs of Staff, regarding the British preparations for final stages of the [[Pacific War]]. Brooke and the rest of the Chiefs of Staff wanted to build up the forces in Australia while Churchill preferred to use India as a base for the British effort. It was an issue over which the [[Chiefs of Staff Committee|Chiefs of Staff]] were prepared to resign, but in the end a compromise was reached.<ref>{{Harvtxt|Fraser|1982}}, pp. 410\u2013421.</ref>\n\nDespite their many disagreements Brooke and Churchill held an affection for each other. After one fierce clash Churchill told his chief of staff and military adviser, [[Hastings Ismay|Sir Hastings Ismay]], that he did not think he could continue to work any longer with Brooke because \"he hates me. I can see hatred looking from his eyes.\" Brooke responded to Ismay: \"Hate him? I don't hate him. I love him. But the first time I tell him that I agree with him when I don't will be the time to get rid of me, for then I can be no more use to him.\" When Churchill was told this he murmured, \"Dear Brookie.\"<ref>{{Harvtxt|Fraser|1982}}, p. 295.</ref>\n\nThe partnership between Brooke and Churchill was a very successful one and led Britain to victory in 1945. According to historian Max Hastings, their partnership \"created the most efficient machine for the higher direction of the war possessed by any combatant nation, even if its judgments were sometimes flawed and its ability to enforce its wishes increasingly constrained\".<ref>{{Harvtxt|Hastings|2005}}, p. 195.</ref>\n\nBrooke's diary entry for 10 September 1944 is particularly revealing of his ambivalent relationship with Churchill:{{quote|...And the wonderful thing is that 3/4 of the population of the world imagine that Churchill is one of the Strategists of History, a second Marlborough, and the other 1/4 have no idea what a public menace he is and has been throughout this war! It is far better that the world should never know, and never suspect the feet of clay of this otherwise superhuman being. Without him England was lost for a certainty, with him England has been on the verge of disaster time and again.... Never have I admired and despised a man simultaneously to the same extent. Never have such opposite extremes been combined in the same human being.<ref>{{Harvtxt|Alanbrooke|2001}}, p. 590</ref>}}\n\n==War diaries==\nBrooke kept a diary during the whole of the Second World War.<ref name=\"Alanbrooke 2001\">{{Harvtxt|Alanbrooke|2001}}</ref> Originally intended for his wife, Benita, the diaries were later expanded on by Brooke in the 1950s. They contain descriptions on the day-to-day running of the British war effort (including some quite indiscreet references to top secret interceptions of German radio traffic),<ref>{{Harvtxt|Alanbrooke|2001}}, see for example entry for 4 November 1942.</ref> Brooke's thoughts on strategy, as well as frequent anecdotes from the many meetings he had with the Allied leadership during the war.<ref name=\"Alanbrooke 2001\"/>\n\nThe diaries have become famous mostly because of the frequent remarks on and criticisms of Churchill. Although the diaries contain passages expressing admiration of Churchill, they also served as a vent for Brooke's frustration with working with the Prime Minister. The diaries also give sharp opinions on several of the top Allied leaders. The American generals [[Dwight D. Eisenhower|Eisenhower]] and [[George Marshall|Marshall]], for example, are described as poor strategists and Field Marshal [[Harold Alexander, 1st Earl Alexander of Tunis|Sir Harold Alexander]] as unintelligent. Among the few individuals of whom Brooke seems to have kept consistently positive opinions, from a military standpoint, were General of the Army [[Douglas MacArthur]],<ref>{{Harvtxt|Alanbrooke|2001}}, see for example entry for 20 November 1943.</ref> Field Marshal [[John Dill|Sir John Dill]], and [[Joseph Stalin]]. Brooke admired Stalin for his quick brain and grasp of military strategy. Otherwise he had no illusions about the man, describing Stalin thus: \"He has got an unpleasantly cold, crafty, dead face, and whenever I look at him I can imagine his sending off people to their doom without ever turning a hair.\"<ref>{{Harvtxt|Alanbrooke|2001}}, entry 14 August 1942.</ref>\n\nEdited by the distinguished historian [[Arthur Bryant|Sir Arthur Bryant]], the diaries were first released (in abridged and censored versions) during 1957 (''The Turn of the Tide<ref>Bryant, Arthur (1957). The turn of the tide 1939-1943.  A study based on the diaries and autobiographical notes of Field Marshall the Viscount Alanbrooke. Collins, London.</ref>'') and 1959 (''Triumph in the West''). Originally Alanbrooke intended that the diaries were never to be published but one reason that he changed his mind was the lack of credit to him and the Chiefs of Staff in Churchill's own war memoirs, which essentially presented their ideas and innovations as the Prime Minister's own. Although censorship and libel laws accounted for numerous suppressions of what Alan Brooke had originally written concerning persons who were still alive, the Bryant books became controversial even in their truncated state, mainly as a result of the comments on Churchill, Marshall, Eisenhower, Gort, and others. Churchill himself did not appreciate the books.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.winstonchurchill.org/i4a/pages/index.cfm?pageid=307|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061004111313/http://www.winstonchurchill.org/i4a/pages/index.cfm?pageid=307|url-status=dead|title=The Churchill Centre|archivedate=4 October 2006}}</ref><ref name=\"Alanbrooke 2001\"/> In 2001, Alex Danchev of Keele University and Daniel Todman of Cambridge University published an unexpurgated version of the Alanbrooke Diaries including original critical remarks that Alanbrooke made at various times that had been suppressed in the Bryant versions.  Danchev and Todman also criticised Bryant's editing, but this is balanced by an assessment by Dr Christopher Harmon, advisor to the Churchill Centre and Professor at the US Marine Corps University.  The fact appears to be that Bryant was inhibited by Alanbrooke's desire not to publish in full his critical diary entries about people who were still alive when Bryant's books were published. <ref>A, Danchev and D.

He held this position from 1946 to 1954. In addition, he served on the boards of several companies, both in industry and in banking. He was director of the [[Anglo-Iranian Oil Company]], the [[Midland Bank]], the National Discount Company and the Belfast Banking Company. Alanbrooke was particularly fond of being a director of the [[Hudson's Bay Company]] where he served for eleven years from 1948.<ref>{{Harvtxt|Fraser|1982}}, pp. 514\u2013515.</ref>\n\n==Private life and ornithology==\nAlanbrooke was married twice. After six years of engagement he married Jane Richardson in 1914, a neighbour in [[County Fermanagh]] in [[Ulster]]. Six days into their honeymoon, the then Alan Brooke was recalled to active duty when the [[World War I|First World War]] started. The couple had one daughter and one son, Rosemary and [[Thomas Brooke, 2nd Viscount Alanbrooke|Thomas]]. Jane Brooke died following a car accident in 1925 in which her husband was at the steering wheel.<ref>{{Harvtxt|Fraser|1982}}, pp. 55, 58, 92\u201393.</ref>\n\nHe married Benita Lees (1892\u20131968), daughter of [[Pelly baronets|Sir Harold Pelly, 4th Bt.]], and the widow of [[Lees Baronets|Sir Thomas Lees, 2nd Bt.]], in 1929. The marriage was very happy for the uxorious Brooke and resulted in one daughter and one son, Kathleen and [[Alan Brooke, 3rd Viscount Alanbrooke|Victor]].<ref>{{Harvtxt|Fraser|1982}}, pp. 96\u2013102.</ref> During the war the couple lived in [[Hartley Wintney]] in [[Hampshire]]. After the war, the Brookes' financial situation forced the couple to move into the gardener's cottage of their former home, where they lived for the rest of their lives. Their last years were darkened by the death of their daughter, Kathleen, in a riding accident in 1961.<ref name=\"Fraser (1982), p.524\">{{Harvtxt|Fraser|1982}}, p. 524</ref>\n\nAlanbrooke had a love of nature. Hunting and fishing were among his great interests. His foremost passion, however, was birds. He was a noted [[ornithologist]], especially in bird photography. He was president of the [[Zoological Society of London]] between 1950 and 1954 and vice-president of the [[Royal Society for the Protection of Birds]] (RSPB) between 1949 and 1961.<ref>{{Harvtxt|Fraser|1982}}, pp. 518\u2013519</ref><ref>{{Harvtxt|Alanbrooke|2001}}, p. xxv\u2013xxvi</ref><ref>{{Harvtxt|RSPB Annual Reports 1949-1961}}, RSPB</ref>\n\n==Death==\n[[File:AlanbrookeGrave.jpg|thumb|right|Lord Alanbrooke's gravestone]]\n\nOn 17 June 1963 Alanbrooke suffered a heart attack and died quietly in his bed with his wife beside him. The same day, he had been due to attend the Garter Service in [[St George's Chapel at Windsor Castle|St George's Chapel]], [[Windsor Castle|Windsor]].

[[Medal bar|Bar]] (23 July 1883 \u2013 17 June 1963), was a senior officer of the [[British Army]]. He was [[Chief of the General Staff (United Kingdom)|Chief of the Imperial General Staff]] (CIGS), the professional head of the British Army, during the [[Second World War]], and was promoted to field marshal in 1944. As chairman of the [[Chiefs of Staff Committee]], Brooke was the foremost military advisor to [[Winston Churchill]], the [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|British Prime Minister]], and had the role of co-ordinator of the [[Military history of the United Kingdom during World War II|British military efforts]] in the [[Allies of World War II|Allies]]' victory in 1945. After retiring from the British Army, he served as [[Lord High Constable of England]] during the [[Coronation of Queen Elizabeth II|Coronation]] of [[Elizabeth II|Queen Elizabeth II]] in 1953. His war diaries attracted attention for their criticism of Churchill and for Brooke's forthright views on other leading figures of the war.\n\n==Background and early life==\nAlan Brooke was born in 1883 at [[Bagn\u00e8res-de-Bigorre]], Hautes-Pyr\u00e9n\u00e9es, to a prominent [[Anglo-Irish]] family from West [[Ulster]] in Ireland with a long military tradition as the ''Fighting Brookes of Colebrooke''.<ref>{{Harvtxt|Roberts|2008}}, p 12\u201313.</ref> He was the seventh and youngest child of [[Victor Brooke|Sir Victor Brooke, 3rd Baronet]], of Colebrooke Park, [[Brookeborough]], [[County Fermanagh]], [[Ulster]], [[Ireland]], and the former Alice Bellingham, second daughter of [[Bellingham baronets|Sir Alan Bellingham, 3rd Baronet]], of Castle Bellingham in [[County Louth]].<ref>{{Harvtxt|Roberts|2008}}, p 12.</ref> Brooke was educated at a day school in [[Pau, Pyr\u00e9n\u00e9es-Atlantiques|Pau]], France, where he lived until the age of 16; he was bi-lingual in French (which he spoke with a heavy Gascon accent) and English.<ref>{{Harvtxt|Roberts|2008}}, p 14.</ref> He spoke both French and English very fast, leading some Americans to distrust a ''fast-talking Limey''. {{sfn|Roberts|2009|pp=14,46}} He was also fluent in German, and had learnt Urdu and Persian.<ref name=\"Fraser 1982 pp.41,44,51\">{{Harvtxt|Fraser|1982}}, pp.41,44,51.</ref>\n\nHe \"only just\" qualified for the [[Royal Military Academy, Woolwich|Royal Military Academy at Woolwich]], coming sixty-fifth out of seventy-two in the entrance exam, but passed out at seventeenth. Had he done any better he would have qualified for a commission in the Royal Engineers and probably would not have ended up on the General Staff after the \"Great War\", showing that initial lack of success could be invaluable later on.{{sfn|Roberts|2009|p=14}}\n\nSo Brooke was, on 24 December 1902, commissioned into the [[Royal Artillery|Royal Regiment of Artillery]] as a [[second lieutenant]].<ref>{{London Gazette|issue=27528|page=1216|date=24 February 1903}}</ref> During the [[First World War]], he served with the [[Royal Artillery]] in France where he gained a reputation as an outstanding planner of operations. At the [[Battle of the Somme]] in 1916, he introduced the French \"[[creeping barrage]]\" system, thereby helping the protection of the advancing infantry from enemy machine gun fire.<ref name=\"Fraser 1982 pp.72-73\">{{Harvtxt|Fraser|1982}}, pp.72\u201373.</ref> Brooke was with the [[Canadian Corps]] from early 1917 and planned the barrages for the [[Battle of Vimy Ridge]]. In 1918 he was appointed GSO1 as the senior artillery staff officer in the First Army.<ref>''Vimy Ridge: A Canadian Reassessment'' edited by Geoff Hayes p98-99</ref> Brooke ended the conflict as a [[Lieutenant colonel (United Kingdom)|lieutenant-colonel]] with the [[Distinguished Service Order]] and [[Medal bar|Bar]].<ref name=\"DSO1\"/><ref name=\"DSO2\"/>\n\nBetween the wars, he was a lecturer at the [[Staff College, Camberley]] and the [[Imperial Defence College]], where Brooke knew most of those who became leading British commanders of the [[Second World War]]. From the mid-1930s Brooke held a number of important appointments: Inspector of Artillery, Director of Military Training and then [[General Officer Commanding|GOC]] of the [[1st (United Kingdom) Division|Mobile Division]]. In 1938, on promotion to [[Lieutenant-general (United Kingdom)|lieutenant-general]] he took command of the Anti-Aircraft Corps (renamed [[Anti-Aircraft Command]] in April 1939) and built a strong relationship with Air Marshal [[Hugh Dowding]], the AOC-in-C of [[Fighter Command]], which laid a vital basis of co-operation between the two commands during the [[Battle of Britain]]. In July 1939 Brooke moved to command [[Southern Command (United Kingdom)|Southern Command]]. By the outbreak of the [[Second World War]], Brooke was already seen as one of the British Army's foremost generals.<ref>{{Harvtxt|Mead|2007}}, p. 78.</ref>\n\n==Second World War==\n===Commander in Flanders, France and Britain===\nFollowing the outbreak of the Second World War, in September 1939, Brooke commanded [[II Corps (United Kingdom)|II Corps]] in the [[British Expeditionary Force (World War II)|British Expeditionary Force]] (BEF)\u2014which included in its subordinate formations the [[3rd Division (United Kingdom)|3rd Infantry Division]], commanded by the then Major-General [[Bernard Montgomery]], as well as Major-General [[Dudley Graham Johnson|Dudley Johnson]]'s [[4th Infantry Division (United Kingdom)|4th Infantry Division]]. As corps commander, Brooke had a pessimistic view of the [[Allies of World War II|Allies]]' chances of countering a German offensive. He was sceptical of the quality and determination of the [[French Army]], and of the [[Belgian Army]]. This scepticism appeared to be justified when he was on a visit to some French front-line units; and was shocked to see unshaven men, ungroomed horses and dirty vehicles.<ref>Reagan, Geoffrey.

Gort, on the other hand, regarded Brooke as a pessimist who failed to spread confidence, and was thinking of replacing him.<ref>{{Harvtxt|Fraser|1982}}, pp. 135\u2013140.</ref>\n\n[[File:The British Army in France 1940 F4134.jpg|thumb|right|Lieutenant-General Sir Alan Brooke sits for a portrait being painted by [[Reginald Eves]], 30 April 1940.]]\n\nWhen the [[Battle of France|German offensive]] began Brooke, aided by [[Neil Ritchie]], his Brigadier General Staff (BGS), distinguished himself in the handling of the British forces in the [[Battle of Dunkirk|retreat to Dunkirk]]. In late May 1940 II Corps held the major German attack on the Ypres-Comine Canal but then found its left flank exposed by the capitulation of the [[Belgian Army#World War II|Belgian army]]. Brooke swiftly ordered Montgomery's 3rd Division to switch from the Corps' right flank to cover the gap. This was accomplished in a complicated night-time manoeuvre. Pushing more troops north to counter the threat to the embarking troops at Dunkirk from German units advancing along the coast, II Corps retreated to their appointed places on the east or south-east of the shrinking perimeter of Dunkirk.<ref name=\"auto\">{{Harvtxt|Mead|2007}}, pp. 78\u201379.</ref>\n\n[[File:The British Army in the United Kingdom 1939-45 H6512.jpg|thumb|left|General Sir Alan Brooke, C-in-C Home Forces (fifth from right, facing camera) inspecting a [[Tetrarch tank|Light Tank Mk VII \"Tetrarch\"]] at the [[Staff College, Camberley]], 6 January 1941.]]\n\nThen on 29 May Brooke was ordered by Gort to return to England, leaving the Corps in Montgomery's hands.<ref name=\"auto\"/> According to Montgomery, Brooke was so overcome with emotion at having to leave his men in such a crisis that \"he broke down and wept\" as he handed over to Monty on the beaches of La Panne.<ref>{{Harvtxt|Caddick-Adams|2012}}, p. 235.</ref> He was told by Gort to ''proceed home ... for (the) task of reforming new armies'' and so returned on a destroyer (30 May). Then ''on June 2nd set out for the War Office to find out what I was wanted for'' with a ''light heart'' and with no responsibility, and was then told by [[John Dill|Dill]] (CIGS) that he was to ''Return to France to form a new BEF''; he later said that hearing the command from Dill was ''one of his blackest (moments) in the war''. He had already realised that there was no hope of success for the ''Brittany plan'' ([[Operation Ariel#Breton redoubt|Breton redoubt]]) to keep an allied redoubt in France. He told the Secretary for War ([[Anthony Eden|Eden]]) that the mission had ''no military value and no hope of success'' although he could not comment on its political value.<ref>{{Harvtxt|Fraser|1982}}, pp.163-167.</ref> In his first conversation with Prime Minister [[Winston Churchill]] (Brooke had been rung by Dill who was at 10 Downing Street) he insisted that all British forces should be withdrawn from France. Churchill initially objected but was eventually convinced by Brooke and around 200,000 British and Allied troops were successfully evacuated from ports in northwestern France.<ref name=\"Fraser 1982 pp.72-73\"/><ref>Brooke, p. 2 in {{London Gazette|issue=37573 |supp=y|page=2434|date=21 May 1946 }}</ref><ref>{{Harvtxt|Alanbrooke|2001}}, entres 29 May & 14 June 1940.</ref><ref>{{Harvtxt|Hastings|2009}}, pp. 51\u201353.</ref>\n\n[[File:The British Army in the United Kingdom 1939-45 H14377.jpg|thumb|right|Senior officers discuss operations during Exercise 'Bumper', 2 October 1941.

Thus it would have been Brooke's task to direct the land battle in the event of [[Operation Sea Lion|German landings]]. Contrary to his predecessor General [[Edmund Ironside, 1st Baron Ironside|Sir Edmund Ironside]], who favoured a static coastal defence, Brooke focused on developing a mobile reserve which was to swiftly counterattack the enemy forces before they were established. A light line of defence on the coast was to assure that the landings were delayed as much as possible. Writing after the war, Brooke acknowledged that he also \"had every intention of using sprayed [[mustard gas]] on the beaches\".<ref>{{Harvtxt|Alanbrooke|2001}}, entry 22 July 1940.</ref><ref>{{Harvtxt|Fraser|1982}}, pp.172\u2013186.</ref>\n\nBrooke believed that the lack of a unified command of the three services was \"a grave danger\" to the defence of the country. Despite this, and the fact that the available forces never reached the numbers he thought were required, Brooke considered the situation far from \"helpless\" in case the Germans invaded. \"We should certainly have a desperate struggle and the future might well have hung in the balance, but I certainly felt that given a fair share of the fortunes of war we should certainly succeed in finally defending these shores\", he wrote after the war.<ref>{{Harvtxt|Alanbrooke|2001}}, entries for 29 July and 15 September 1940.</ref><ref>{{Harvtxt|Fraser|1982}}, pp.178\u2013184.</ref> But in the end, the [[Operation Sea Lion|German invasion plan]] was never taken beyond the preliminary assembly of forces.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/history/worldwars/wwtwo/invasion_ww2_01.shtml |title=History \u2013 World Wars: The German Threat to Britain in World War Two |publisher=BBC |date= |accessdate=2012-10-14}}</ref>\n\n===Chief of the Imperial General Staff===\nIn December 1941 Brooke succeeded [[Field marshal (United Kingdom)|Field Marshal]] [[John Dill|Sir John Dill]] as [[Chief of the General Staff (United Kingdom)|Chief of the Imperial General Staff]] (CIGS), the professional head of the British Army,<ref>{{London Gazette| issue=35397|page=7369|date=26 December 1941| supp=y}}</ref> in which appointment he also represented the British Army on the [[Chiefs of Staff Committee]].

As CIGS, Brooke was the functional head of the British Army, and as chairman of the Chiefs of Staff Committee, which he dominated by force of intellect and personality, he took the leading military part in the overall strategic direction of the British war effort. In 1942, Brooke joined the [[Allies of World War II|Western Allies]]' ultimate command, the U.S.-British [[Combined Chiefs of Staff]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.kingscollections.org/catalogues/lhcma/collection/a/br60-001/|title=Alanbrooke, FM Alan Francis, 1st Viscount Alanbrooke of Brookeborough (1883\u20131963)|publisher=[[Liddell Hart Military Archives]]|accessdate=10 March 2016}}</ref> \nBrooke was responsible for commanding the entire British Army; he focused on grand strategy, and his relationships, through the Combined Chiefs of Staff, with his American counterparts.  He was also responsible for the appointment and evaluation of senior commanders, allocation of manpower and equipment and the organization of tactical air forces in support of land operations of field commanders. In addition he had primary responsibility for supervising the military operations of the Free French, Polish, Dutch, Belgian, and Czech units reporting to their governments in exile in London.  Brooke vigorously allocated responsibilities to his deputies. Despite the traditional historical distrust that had existed between the military and the political side of the War Office, he got along quite well with his counterpart, the [[Secretary of State for War]], first the Conservative politicians [[David Margesson, 1st Viscount Margesson|David Margesson]] and later Sir [[James Grigg]], a former civil servant in the department. <ref>Andrew Roberts, ''Masters and Commanders: How Four Titans Won the War in the West, 1941-1945'' (2010) pp 61-62.</ref>\n\n[[File:Brooke - Churchill - Montgomery.jpg|275px|thumb|upright|right|Brooke (on the left) and [[Winston Churchill|Churchill]] visit [[Bernard Montgomery]]'s mobile headquarters in [[Normandy]], [[France]], 12 June 1944.]]\n\nBrooke's focus was primarily on the [[Mediterranean and Middle East theatre of World War II|Mediterranean Theatre of Operations]]. Here, his key issues were to rid [[North African Campaign|North Africa]] of [[Axis powers|Axis forces]] and knock Italy out of the war, thereby opening up the Mediterranean for Allied shipping, and then mount the cross channel invasion when the Allies were ready and the Germans sufficiently weakened.<ref>{{Harvtxt|Alanbrooke|2001}}, entry 17 July 1942.</ref>\n\nBrooke's and the British view of the Mediterranean operations contrasted with the American commitment to an [[Operation Roundup (1942)|early invasion of western Europe]], which led to several heated arguments at the many conferences of the Combined Chiefs of Staff.<ref name=historynet>{{cite web|url=http://www.historynet.com/what-if-the-allies-had-invaded-france-in-1943.htm|title=What If the Allies Had Invaded France in 1943?|publisher=History.net|accessdate=10 March 2016}}</ref>\n\nDuring the first years of the Anglo-American alliance, it was often the British who got their way. At the London Conference in April 1942, Brooke and Churchill seem to have misled [[General (United States)|General]] [[George Marshall]], the [[Chief of Staff of the United States Army|U.S. Army Chief of Staff]], about the British intentions on an early landing in France. At the [[Casablanca Conference]] in January 1943, it was decided that the Allies should [[Allied invasion of Sicily|invade Sicily]], under the command of [[General (United States)|General]] [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]], a decision that effectively postponed the planned invasion of Western Europe until 1944. The Casablanca agreement was in fact a compromise, brokered largely by Brooke's old friend Field Marshal Sir [[John Dill]], Chief of the British Joint Staff Mission in [[Washington, D.C.|Washington DC]]. \"I owe him [Dill] an unbounded debt of gratitude for his help on that occasion and in many other similar ones\", Brooke wrote after the war.<ref>{{Harvtxt|Alanbrooke|2001}}, entry 18 January 1943</ref>\n\nThe post of CIGS was less rewarding than command in an important theatre of war but the CIGS chose the generals who commanded those theatres and decided what men and munitions they should have. When it came to finding the right commanders he often complained that many officers who would have been good commanders had been killed in the First World War and that this was one reason behind the difficulties the British had in the beginning of the war.<ref>{{Harvtxt|Alanbrooke|2001}}, entry 8 October 1941.</ref> When [[General (United Kingdom)|General]] [[Claude Auchinleck|Sir Claude Auchinleck]] was to be replaced as the commander of the [[Eighth Army (United Kingdom)|British Eighth Army]] in 1942, Brooke preferred [[Lieutenant-general (United Kingdom)|Lieutenant-General]] [[Bernard Montgomery]] instead of Lieutenant General [[William Gott]], who was Churchill's candidate. Soon thereafter Gott was killed in an air crash and Montgomery received the command. Brooke would later reflect upon the tragic event which led to the appointment of Montgomery as an intervention by God.<ref>{{Harvtxt|Alanbrooke|2001}}, entry 7 August 1942</ref> Earlier in 1942 Brooke had been offered the command of British forces in the Middle East. Brooke declined, believing he now knew better than any other general how to deal with Churchill.<ref>{{Harvtxt|Alanbrooke|2001}}, entry 6 August 1942</ref>\n\n[[File:The British Army in Italy 1943 NA9857.jpg|thumb|left|[[General (United Kingdom)|General]] [[Bernard Montgomery|Sir Bernard Montgomery]] in his staff car with General [[Harold Alexander, 1st Earl Alexander of Tunis|Sir Harold Alexander]] and General Sir Alan Brooke, during an inspection of the [[8th Infantry Division (India)|8th Indian Division]] HQ, Italy, 15 December 1943.]]\n\nA year later, the war had taken a different turn and Brooke no longer believed it necessary to stay at Churchill's side. He therefore looked forward to taking command of the [[Western Front (World War II)|Allied invasion of Western Europe]], a post Brooke believed he had been promised by Churchill on three occasions. During the [[Quebec Conference, 1943|first Quebec Conference]] in August 1943, it was decided that the command would go to General George Marshall. (Although in the event Marshall's work as U.S. Army Chief of Staff was too important for him to leave Washington DC and Dwight D. Eisenhower was appointed instead.) Brooke was bitterly disappointed, both at being passed over and of the way the decision was conveyed to him by Churchill, who according to Brooke \"dealt with the matter as if it were one of minor importance\".<ref>{{Harvtxt|Alanbrooke|2001}}, entry 15 August 1943. See also entries for 15 June 7 and 14 July 1943.</ref>\n\n[[File:Statue of Lord Alanbrooke (8281927746).jpg|thumb|upright|[[Statue of the Viscount Alanbrooke, London|Statue of Field Marshal The Viscount Alanbrooke]], [[Ministry of Defence (United Kingdom)|Ministry of Defence]] Building, [[Whitehall]], [[London]].]]\n\nBrooke or \"Brookie\" as he was often known, is reckoned to be one of the foremost of all the heads of the British Army. He was quick in mind and speech and deeply respected by his military colleagues, both British and Allied, although his uncompromising style could make the Americans wary.<ref>{{Harvtxt|Fraser|1982}}, pp.525\u2013539.</ref>\n\nAs CIGS, Brooke had a strong influence on the grand strategy of the Western Allies. The war in the west unfolded more or less according to his plans, at least until 1943 when the [[United States Armed Forces|American forces]] still were relatively small in comparison to the British. Among the most crucial of his contributions was his opposition to an early landing in France, which was important for delaying [[Operation Overlord|Operation ''Overlord'']] until June 1944.<ref name=historynet/>\n\nHe was a cautious general with a great respect for the [[German Army (Wehrmacht)|German war machine]]. Some American planners thought that Brooke's participation in the campaigns of the First World War and in the two evacuations from France in the Second World War made him lack the aggression they believed necessary for victory.<ref>{{Harvtxt|Roberts|2008}}, p 140.</ref> According to [[Max Hastings]], Brooke's reputation as a strategist was \"significantly damaged\" by his remarks at the [[Washington Conference (1943)|Trident Conference]] in Washington in May 1943, where he claimed that no major operations on the continent would be possible until 1945 or 1946.<ref>{{Harvtxt|Hastings|2009}}, p 378\u2013379.</ref> His diary says that he wanted ''operations in the Mediterranean to force a dispersal of German forces, help Russia, and thus eventually produce a situation where cross Channel operations are possible'' but that Churchill ''entirely repudiated'' (or half repudiated) the paper we (the CCOS) had agreed on; Harry Hopkins got him to withdraw his proposed amendments but that Churchill had aroused suspicions with his talk of ''ventures in the Balkans.''<ref>{{Harvtxt|Alanbrooke|2001}}, entries for 24 & 25 May 1943</ref>\n\n===Relationship with Churchill===\nDuring the years as CIGS, Brooke had a stormy relationship with [[Winston Churchill]]. Brooke was often frustrated with the Prime Minister's habits and working methods, his abuse of generals and constant meddling in strategic matters. At the same time Brooke greatly admired Churchill for the way he inspired the Allied cause and for the way he bore the heavy burden of war leadership. In one typical passage in Brooke's war diaries Churchill is described as a \"genius mixed with an astonishing lack of vision \u2013 he is quite the most difficult man to work with that I have ever struck but I should not have missed the chance of working with him for anything on earth!\"<ref>{{Harvtxt|Alanbrooke|2001}}, entry for 30 August 1943.</ref>\n\nShortly after Pearl Harbor, Churchill and his senior military staff used the [[Arcadia Conference]] in Washington to decide the general strategy for the war. The American Army Chief of Staff [[George Marshall]] came up with the idea of a [[Combined Chiefs of Staff]] that would make final military decisions (subject to approval by  Roosevelt and Churchill). Marshall sold it to Roosevelt and together the two sold the idea to Churchill. Churchill's military aides were much less favorable, and Brooke was strongly opposed. However, Brooke was left behind in London to handle the daily details of running the British war effort, and was not consulted.  The combined board was permanently stationed in Washington, where Field Marshall [[John Dill]] represented the British half.  The Combined Board did have thirteen in-person full meetings, which Brooke attended.<ref>Andrew Roberts, ''Masters and Commanders: How Four Titans Won the War in the West, 1941-1945'' (2009) pp 66-101.</ref>\n\n[[File:Winston Churchill and his Chiefs of Staff around a conference table aboard SS QUEEN MARY en route to the USA, May 1943.

Prime Minister Churchill is presiding over the meeting at the end of the table.]]\n\nWhen Churchill's many fanciful strategic ideas collided with sound military strategy it was only Brooke on the Chiefs of Staff Committee who was able to stand up to the Prime Minister. Churchill said about Brooke: \"When I thump the table and push my face towards him what does he do? Thumps the table harder and glares back at me. I know these Brookes \u2013 stiff-necked [[Ulster]]men and there's no one worse to deal with than that!\"<ref>{{cite book|author=Winston S.

The CIGS was sceptical about the British intervention in the [[Greek Civil War]] in late 1944 (during the ''[[Dekemvriana]]''), believing this was an operation which would drain troops from the [[Western Front (World War II)|central front in Germany]]. But at this stage the war was practically won and Churchill saw the possibility of preventing Greece from becoming a communist state.<ref>{{Harvtxt|Fraser|1982}}, pp. 471\u2013473.</ref>\n\nThe balance of the Chiefs of Staff Committee was tilted in October 1943 when [[Dudley Pound|Admiral Sir Dudley Pound]], Brooke's predecessor as chairman, retired as a result of poor health and Admiral [[Andrew Cunningham, 1st Viscount Cunningham of Hyndhope|Sir Andrew Cunningham]] succeeded Pound as [[First Sea Lord]] and naval representative on the Chiefs of Staff Committee. Brooke as a consequence got a firm ally in his arguments with Churchill.<ref>{{Harvtxt|Reynolds|2005}}, p. 405.</ref> This was reflected in the most serious clash between the Prime Minister and the Chiefs of Staff, regarding the British preparations for final stages of the [[Pacific War]]. Brooke and the rest of the Chiefs of Staff wanted to build up the forces in Australia while Churchill preferred to use India as a base for the British effort. It was an issue over which the [[Chiefs of Staff Committee|Chiefs of Staff]] were prepared to resign, but in the end a compromise was reached.<ref>{{Harvtxt|Fraser|1982}}, pp. 410\u2013421.</ref>\n\nDespite their many disagreements Brooke and Churchill held an affection for each other. After one fierce clash Churchill told his chief of staff and military adviser, [[Hastings Ismay|Sir Hastings Ismay]], that he did not think he could continue to work any longer with Brooke because \"he hates me. I can see hatred looking from his eyes.\" Brooke responded to Ismay: \"Hate him? I don't hate him. I love him. But the first time I tell him that I agree with him when I don't will be the time to get rid of me, for then I can be no more use to him.\" When Churchill was told this he murmured, \"Dear Brookie.\"<ref>{{Harvtxt|Fraser|1982}}, p. 295.</ref>\n\nThe partnership between Brooke and Churchill was a very successful one and led Britain to victory in 1945. According to historian Max Hastings, their partnership \"created the most efficient machine for the higher direction of the war possessed by any combatant nation, even if its judgments were sometimes flawed and its ability to enforce its wishes increasingly constrained\".<ref>{{Harvtxt|Hastings|2005}}, p. 195.</ref>\n\nBrooke's diary entry for 10 September 1944 is particularly revealing of his ambivalent relationship with Churchill:{{quote|...And the wonderful thing is that 3/4 of the population of the world imagine that Churchill is one of the Strategists of History, a second Marlborough, and the other 1/4 have no idea what a public menace he is and has been throughout this war! It is far better that the world should never know, and never suspect the feet of clay of this otherwise superhuman being. Without him England was lost for a certainty, with him England has been on the verge of disaster time and again.... Never have I admired and despised a man simultaneously to the same extent. Never have such opposite extremes been combined in the same human being.<ref>{{Harvtxt|Alanbrooke|2001}}, p. 590</ref>}}\n\n==War diaries==\nBrooke kept a diary during the whole of the Second World War.<ref name=\"Alanbrooke 2001\">{{Harvtxt|Alanbrooke|2001}}</ref> Originally intended for his wife, Benita, the diaries were later expanded on by Brooke in the 1950s. They contain descriptions on the day-to-day running of the British war effort (including some quite indiscreet references to top secret interceptions of German radio traffic),<ref>{{Harvtxt|Alanbrooke|2001}}, see for example entry for 4 November 1942.</ref> Brooke's thoughts on strategy, as well as frequent anecdotes from the many meetings he had with the Allied leadership during the war.<ref name=\"Alanbrooke 2001\"/>\n\nThe diaries have become famous mostly because of the frequent remarks on and criticisms of Churchill. Although the diaries contain passages expressing admiration of Churchill, they also served as a vent for Brooke's frustration with working with the Prime Minister. The diaries also give sharp opinions on several of the top Allied leaders. The American generals [[Dwight D. Eisenhower|Eisenhower]] and [[George Marshall|Marshall]], for example, are described as poor strategists and Field Marshal [[Harold Alexander, 1st Earl Alexander of Tunis|Sir Harold Alexander]] as unintelligent. Among the few individuals of whom Brooke seems to have kept consistently positive opinions, from a military standpoint, were General of the Army [[Douglas MacArthur]],<ref>{{Harvtxt|Alanbrooke|2001}}, see for example entry for 20 November 1943.</ref> Field Marshal [[John Dill|Sir John Dill]], and [[Joseph Stalin]]. Brooke admired Stalin for his quick brain and grasp of military strategy. Otherwise he had no illusions about the man, describing Stalin thus: \"He has got an unpleasantly cold, crafty, dead face, and whenever I look at him I can imagine his sending off people to their doom without ever turning a hair.\"<ref>{{Harvtxt|Alanbrooke|2001}}, entry 14 August 1942.</ref>\n\nEdited by the distinguished historian [[Arthur Bryant|Sir Arthur Bryant]], the diaries were first released (in abridged and censored versions) during 1957 (''The Turn of the Tide'') and 1959 (''Triumph in the West''). Originally Alanbrooke intended that the diaries were never to be published but one reason that he changed his mind was the lack of credit to him and the Chiefs of Staff in Churchill's own war memoirs, which essentially presented their ideas and innovations as the Prime Minister's own. Although censorship and libel laws accounted for numerous suppressions of what Alan Brooke had originally written concerning persons who were still alive, the Bryant books became controversial even in their truncated state, mainly as a result of the comments on Churchill, Marshall, Eisenhower, Gort, and others. Churchill himself did not appreciate the books.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.winstonchurchill.org/i4a/pages/index.cfm?pageid=307|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061004111313/http://www.winstonchurchill.org/i4a/pages/index.cfm?pageid=307|url-status=dead|title=The Churchill Centre|archivedate=4 October 2006}}</ref><ref name=\"Alanbrooke 2001\"/> In 2001, Alex Danchev of Keele University and Daniel Todman of Cambridge University published an unexpurgated version of the Alanbrooke Diaries including original critical remarks that Alanbrooke made at various times that had been suppressed in the Bryant versions.  Danchev and Todman also criticised Bryant's editing, but this is balanced by an assessment by Dr Christopher Harmon, advisor to the Churchill Centre and Professor at the US Marine Corps University.  The fact appears to be that Bryant was inhibited by Alanbrooke's desire not to publish in full his critical diary entries about people who were still alive when Bryant's books were published. <ref>A, Danchev and D.

He held this position from 1946 to 1954. In addition, he served on the boards of several companies, both in industry and in banking. He was director of the [[Anglo-Iranian Oil Company]], the [[Midland Bank]], the National Discount Company and the Belfast Banking Company. Alanbrooke was particularly fond of being a director of the [[Hudson's Bay Company]] where he served for eleven years from 1948.<ref>{{Harvtxt|Fraser|1982}}, pp. 514\u2013515.</ref>\n\n==Private life and ornithology==\nAlanbrooke was married twice. After six years of engagement he married Jane Richardson in 1914, a neighbour in [[County Fermanagh]] in [[Ulster]]. Six days into their honeymoon, the then Alan Brooke was recalled to active duty when the [[World War I|First World War]] started. The couple had one daughter and one son, Rosemary and [[Thomas Brooke, 2nd Viscount Alanbrooke|Thomas]]. Jane Brooke died following a car accident in 1925 in which her husband was at the steering wheel.<ref>{{Harvtxt|Fraser|1982}}, pp. 55, 58, 92\u201393.</ref>\n\nHe married Benita Lees (1892\u20131968), daughter of [[Pelly baronets|Sir Harold Pelly, 4th Bt.]], and the widow of [[Lees Baronets|Sir Thomas Lees, 2nd Bt.]], in 1929. The marriage was very happy for the uxorious Brooke and resulted in one daughter and one son, Kathleen and [[Alan Brooke, 3rd Viscount Alanbrooke|Victor]].<ref>{{Harvtxt|Fraser|1982}}, pp. 96\u2013102.</ref> During the war the couple lived in [[Hartley Wintney]] in [[Hampshire]]. After the war, the Brookes' financial situation forced the couple to move into the gardener's cottage of their former home, where they lived for the rest of their lives. Their last years were darkened by the death of their daughter, Kathleen, in a riding accident in 1961.<ref name=\"Fraser (1982), p.524\">{{Harvtxt|Fraser|1982}}, p. 524</ref>\n\nAlanbrooke had a love of nature. Hunting and fishing were among his great interests. His foremost passion, however, was birds. He was a noted [[ornithologist]], especially in bird photography. He was president of the [[Zoological Society of London]] between 1950 and 1954 and vice-president of the [[Royal Society for the Protection of Birds]] (RSPB) between 1949 and 1961.<ref>{{Harvtxt|Fraser|1982}}, pp. 518\u2013519</ref><ref>{{Harvtxt|Alanbrooke|2001}}, p. xxv\u2013xxvi</ref><ref>{{Harvtxt|RSPB Annual Reports 1949-1961}}, RSPB</ref>\n\n==Death==\n[[File:AlanbrookeGrave.jpg|thumb|right|Lord Alanbrooke's gravestone]]\n\nOn 17 June 1963 Alanbrooke suffered a heart attack and died quietly in his bed with his wife beside him.

Written by [[Bert Russell]] (also known as Bert Berns), this song was covered in the sixties by a number of artists, including [[Helen Shapiro]] and [[Alma Cogan]], and was successfully revived in the late 1990s by [[Vonda Shepard]], for the American [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] television program, ''[[Ally McBeal]]''.

In September of that year she suffered a broken jaw when a chauffeur-driven [[limousine]]<ref>Jet Harris obit, ''[[Daily Telegraph]]'', 19 March 2011.</ref> in which she and [[Jet Harris]], former bass guitarist of the [[The Shadows|Shadows]], were returning from a concert in [[Worcester]]<ref name=\"Dave Thompson 2005 Cream\">Dave Thompson (2005) ''Cream''</ref> crashed in the [[West Midlands conurbation|West Midlands]].

(RPM 326), Davis acknowledges the scandal, but also places blame for the \"lost momentum\" on being unable to record for four months due to having her jaw wired shut after the accident.<ref>Kieron Taylor, liner notes, ''Whatcha Gonna Do?: Singles, Rarities and Unreleased 1963\u20131966'', RPM Records 326, 2007 (notes dated February 2007)</ref>\n\n==Style==\nDavis was an early proponent of many of the fashion styles for which the 1960s are remembered: [[bob cut|bobbed hair]], long boots of the kind popularised by [[Honor Blackman]] in early episodes of ''[[The Avengers (TV series)|The Avengers]]'' and leather [[miniskirt|mini-skirts]].

In the late 1960s Davis returned to Decca, with former ''[[Ready Steady Go!]]'' presenter [[Michael Aldred]] as her producer. Recordings included [[Chip Taylor]]'s \"[[Angel of the Morning]]\", in 1967, on which she was backed by, amongst others, [[Kiki Dee]] and [[P. P. Arnold]].  Arnold later recorded the song herself and had the bigger hit in 1968. Davis' final chart entry was a [[Northern soul]] version of [[Jon Hendricks]]' \"I Want You to Be My Baby\", originally recorded by [[Louis Jordan]] in 1952, which reached number 33 in October 1968,<ref name=\"British Hit Singles & Albums\" /> although sales were affected by an industrial dispute at the manufacturing plant.<ref>Billie Davis, quoted in notes for ''The Decca Years'' (2005)</ref>\n\nDavis left Decca in April 1971 after a stay of eight years.<ref name=\"NME Rock 'N' Roll Years 2\">{{cite book\n| first= John\n| last= Tobler\n| year= 1992\n| title= NME Rock 'N' Roll Years\n| edition= 1st\n| publisher= Reed International Books Ltd \n| location= London\n| page= 225\n| id= CN 5585}}</ref> She continued to record into the 1980s and was popular, in particular, with audiences in the Spanish-speaking world.{{citation needed|date=January 2009}} Her cover of [[Burt Bacharach]]'s \"The Last One to Be Loved\" appeared on the [[compilation album|compilation]] album ''Trains & Boats & Covers'' (1999).<ref name=\"AMG\" /> A retrospective collection of her recordings for Decca was released in 2005.<ref>''Tell Him \u2013 Billie Davis \u2013 The Decca Years''</ref>\n\nIn 2006 she was re-united with Jet Harris for a series for concerts.\n\n== Personal Life ==\nBillie has lived in North London for most of her life and career.

\"[[Tell Him (Bert Berns song)|Tell Him]]\" (1963) and \"[[I Want You to Be My Baby]]\" (1968).\n\n==Early career==\nDavis' performing name was suggested by the [[impresario]], [[Robert Stigwood]], and was derived from those of [[blues]] singer [[Billie Holiday]] and the entertainer [[Sammy Davis Jr]].<ref>See sleeve notes to ''Tell Him \u2013 Billie Davis \u2013 The Decca Years'' (LC5084,

backed by [[Cliff Bennett and the Rebel Rousers|Cliff Bennett]]'s band, the Rebel Rousers, she cut some early demo [[gramophone record|records]] with [[the Tornados]] for record producer [[Joe Meek]].<ref name=\"AMG\">{{cite web|url={{Allmusic|class=artist|id=p509255|pure_url=yes}}|title=Biography by Bruce Eder|publisher=Allmusic.com|accessdate=12 January 2009}}</ref> However, her first

released (on the 17th).</ref> on which she performed as a foil to [[Mike Sarne]], rather as [[Wendy Richard]] had done on Sarne's [[chart-topper|chart-topping]] disc, \"[[Come Outside (song)|Come

This reached number 18 in the [[UK Singles Chart]] in September 1962.<ref>''Rock File 4'' (ed Charlie Gillett & Simon Frith, 1976)</ref>\n\nIn February 1963 Davis had her biggest success with a cover version of [[The Exciters]]' \"Tell Him\". Written by [[Bert Russell]] (also known as Bert Berns), this song was covered in the sixties by a number of artists, including [[Helen Shapiro]] and [[Alma Cogan]], and was successfully revived in the late 1990s by [[Vonda Shepard]], for the American [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] television program, ''[[Ally McBeal]]''.

In September of that year she suffered a broken jaw when a chauffeur-driven [[limousine]]<ref>Jet Harris obit, ''[[Daily Telegraph]]'', 19 March 2011.</ref> in which she and [[Jet Harris]], former bass guitarist of the [[The Shadows|Shadows]], were returning from a concert in [[Worcester]]<ref name=\"Dave Thompson 2005 Cream\">Dave Thompson (2005) ''Cream''</ref> crashed in the [[West Midlands conurbation|West Midlands]].

(RPM 326), Davis acknowledges the scandal, but also places blame for the \"lost momentum\" on being unable to record for four months due to having her jaw wired shut after the accident.<ref>Kieron Taylor, liner notes, ''Whatcha Gonna Do?: Singles, Rarities and Unreleased 1963\u20131966'', RPM Records 326, 2007 (notes dated February 2007)</ref>\n\n==Style==\nDavis was an early proponent of many of the fashion styles for which the 1960s are remembered: [[bob cut|bobbed hair]], long boots of the kind popularised by [[Honor Blackman]] in early episodes of ''[[The Avengers (TV series)|The Avengers]]'' and leather [[miniskirt|mini-skirts]]. She was said to have beaten the latter for 'percussive effect' when recording.<ref>Simon Goddard, January 2005 (notes for ''The Decca Years'', 2005)</ref> The biographer of the \"[[Supergroup (music)|supergroup]]\" [[Cream (band)|Cream]] has described her as \"astonishingly photogenic\".<ref name=\"Dave Thompson 2005 Cream\" />\n\n==Later career==\nIn 1966, Davis paired with Keith Powell (Keith Powell and the Valets) as \u201cKeith (Powell) and Billie (Davis)\u201d under the Piccadilly record label.{{cn|date=April 2020}} They released three singles including \u201cSwingin\u2019 Tight\u201d, which while popular didn\u2019t make the charts and the short lived pairing was dissolved.  In the late 1960s Davis returned to Decca, with former ''[[Ready Steady Go!]]'' presenter [[Michael Aldred]] as her producer. Recordings included [[Chip Taylor]]'s \"[[Angel of the Morning]]\", in 1967, on which she was backed by, amongst others, [[Kiki Dee]] and [[P. P. Arnold]].  Arnold later recorded the song herself and had the bigger hit in 1968. Davis' final chart entry was a [[Northern soul]] version of [[Jon Hendricks]]' \"I Want You to Be My Baby\", originally recorded by [[Louis Jordan]] in 1952, which reached number 33 in October 1968,<ref name=\"British Hit Singles & Albums\" /> although sales were affected by an industrial dispute at the manufacturing plant.<ref>Billie Davis, quoted in notes for ''The Decca Years'' (2005)</ref>\n\nDavis left Decca in April 1971 after a stay of eight years.<ref name=\"NME Rock 'N' Roll Years 2\">{{cite book\n| first= John\n| last= Tobler\n| year= 1992\n| title= NME Rock 'N' Roll Years\n| edition= 1st\n| publisher= Reed International Books Ltd \n| location= London\n| page= 225\n| id= CN 5585}}</ref> She continued to record into the 1980s and was popular, in particular, with audiences in the Spanish-speaking world.{{citation needed|date=January 2009}} Her cover of [[Burt Bacharach]]'s \"The Last One to Be Loved\" appeared on the [[compilation album|compilation]] album ''Trains & Boats & Covers'' (1999).<ref name=\"AMG\" /> A retrospective collection of her recordings for Decca was released in 2005.<ref>''Tell Him \u2013 Billie Davis \u2013 The Decca Years''</ref>\n\nIn 2006 she was re-united with Jet Harris for a series for concerts.\n\n== Personal Life ==\nBillie has lived in North London for most of her life and career.

{"title_page": "Generosity", "text_new": "\n\n'''Generosity''' (also called largess) is the virtue of being liberal in giving, often as [[gift|gifts]].<ref>Michael Pakaluk, ''Aristotle's Nicomachean Ethics: An Introduction'', 2005, p. 173 explains the translation difficulties and names ''generosity'' as the least bad translation of Greek ''eleutheriotes'' ([https://books.google.ee/books?id=c1ZR3AU2WIwC&pg=PA173&lpg=PA173&dq=eleutheriotes&source=bl&ots=x2dWc48SmO&sig=yH411BOBRI3g7wSDJyWViC-FVgY&hl=de&sa=X&ei=bVRPVa-XBsmGywP1uYCACg&ved=0CCEQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=eleutheriotes&f=false Google Books])</ref> Generosity is regarded as a [[virtue]] by various world religions, and is often celebrated in cultural and religious ceremonies. Scientific investigation into generosity has examined the effect of a number of scenarios and games on individuals' generosity, and potential links with [[neurochemicals]] such as [[oxytocin]], and relationship with similar feelings, such as that of [[empathy]].\n\n==Other uses==\n{{Quote box|width=25em|align=right|quote=The most generous of people is the one who gives to those from whom he has no hope of return.|salign=right |source=\u2014 [[Husain ibn Ali]]<ref>{{cite web |title=Saying of Imam Hussain |url=https://aliimmam.com/tag/imam-hussain-whoishussian/page/2/ |website=POiSON WORLD |publisher=POiSON WORLD |accessdate=29 October 2018}}</ref> }}\n\nGenerosity is sometimes used to denote [[Charity (practice)|charity]], (the virtue of giving without expecting anything in return). It can involve offering time, assets or talents to aid someone in need. In times of [[natural disaster]], relief efforts are frequently provided, voluntarily, by individuals or groups acting unilaterally in making gifts of time, resources, goods, money, etc. Generosity is a guiding principle for many registered [[charities]], [[foundation (charity)|foundations]], and [[non-profit organization]]s.\n\nAlthough the term generosity often goes hand-in-hand with charity, many people in the public's eye want recognition for their good deeds. Donations are needed to support organizations and committees, however, generosity should not be limited to times of great need such as natural disasters and extreme situations.\n[[File:Pakistan President Mohammed Ayub Khan presents Mrs. Kennedy with a bay gelding as a gift, March 22, 1962 (cropped).jpg|thumb|[[Ayub Khan (President of Pakistan)|Mohammed Ayub Khan]], the second [[List of Presidents of Pakistan|president of Pakistan]] presenting [[Jackie Kennedy]] a [[gelding]], 1962]]\n\n==Etymology==\nThe modern English word ''generosity'' derives from the Latin word ''gener\u014dsus'', which means \"of noble birth\", which itself was passed down to English through the Old French word ''g\u00e9n\u00e9reux''. The Latin stem ''gener\u2013'' is the [[declension]]al stem of ''genus'', meaning \"kin\", \"clan\", \"race\", or \"stock\", with the root Indo-European meaning of ''gen'' being \"to beget\". The same root gives the words ''genesis'', ''gentry'', ''gender'', ''genital'', ''gentile'', ''genealogy'', and ''genius'', among others.\n\n[[File:Sharing Gifts (4497043378).jpg|thumb|left|Members of the [[Romanian Land Forces|Romanian Army]] sharing gifts with children in [[Afghanistan]], 2009]]\nMost recorded English uses of the word ''generous'' up to and during the sixteenth century reflect an aristocratic sense of being of noble lineage or high birth. To be generous was literally a way of complying with nobility. \n\nDuring the 17th century, however, the meaning and use of the word began to change. ''Generosity'' came increasingly to identify not literal family heritage but a nobility of spirit thought to be associated with high birth\u2014that is, with various admirable qualities that could now vary from person to person, depending not on family history but on whether a person actually possessed the qualities. In this way ''generosity'' increasingly came in the 17th century to signify a variety of traits of character and action historically associated (whether accurately or not) with the ideals of actual nobility: gallantry, courage, strength, richness, gentleness, and fairness. In addition to describing these diverse human qualities, ''generous'' became a word during this period used to describe fertile land, the strength of animal breeds, abundant provisions of food, vibrancy of colors, the strength of liquor, and the potency of medicine.\n\nThen, during the 18th century, the meaning of ''generosity'' continued to evolve in directions denoting the more specific, contemporary meaning of munificence, open\u2013handedness, and liberality in the giving of money and possessions to others. This more specific meaning came to dominate English usage by the 19th century. Over the last five centuries in the English speaking world, ''generosity'' developed from being primarily the description of an [[ascribed status]] pertaining to the elite nobility to being an achieved mark of admirable personal quality and action capable of being exercised in theory by any person who had learned virtue and noble character (Smith 2009).\n\n==In religion==\n[[File:Flickr - The U.S. Army - www.Army.mil (177).jpg|thumb|Members of the [[1st Sustainment Command (Theater)|US Army 1st Sustainment Command]] wrap [[Gift|Christmas gifts]] for soldiers stationed in or passing through [[Kuwait]], 2008]]\nIn [[Buddhism]], generosity is one of the [[Ten Perfections]] and is the [[antidote]] to the self-chosen [[poison]] called ''greed''. Generosity is known as [[d\u0101na]] in the Eastern religious scriptures.\n\nIn [[Islam]], Quran states that whatever one gives away generously, with the intention of pleasing God, He will replace it. God knows what is in the hearts of men.

It can involve offering time, assets or talents to aid someone in need. In times of [[natural disaster]], relief efforts are frequently provided, voluntarily, by individuals or groups acting unilaterally in making gifts of time, resources, goods, money, etc. Generosity is a guiding principle for many registered [[charities]], [[foundation (charity)|foundations]], and [[non-profit organization]]s.\n\nAlthough the term generosity often goes hand-in-hand with charity, many people in the public's eye want recognition for their good deeds. Donations are needed to support organizations and committees, however, generosity should not be limited to times of great need such as natural disasters and extreme situations.\n[[File:Pakistan President Mohammed Ayub Khan presents Mrs. Kennedy with a bay gelding as a gift, March 22, 1962 (cropped).jpg|thumb|[[Ayub Khan (President of Pakistan)|Mohammed Ayub Khan]], the second [[List of Presidents of Pakistan|president of Pakistan]] presenting [[Jackie Kennedy]] a [[gelding]], 1962]]\n\n==Etymology==\nThe modern English word ''generosity'' derives from the Latin word ''gener\u014dsus'', which means \"of noble birth\", which itself was passed down to English through the Old French word ''g\u00e9n\u00e9reux''. The Latin stem ''gener\u2013'' is the [[declension]]al stem of ''genus'', meaning \"kin\", \"clan\", \"race\", or \"stock\", with the root Indo-European meaning of ''gen'' being \"to beget\". The same root gives the words ''genesis'', ''gentry'', ''gender'', ''genital'', ''gentile'', ''genealogy'', and ''genius'', among others.\n\n[[File:Sharing Gifts (4497043378).jpg|thumb|left|Members of the [[Romanian Land Forces|Romanian Army]] sharing gifts with children in [[Afghanistan]], 2009]]\nMost recorded English uses of the word ''generous'' up to and during the sixteenth century reflect an aristocratic sense of being of noble lineage or high birth. To be generous was literally a way of complying with nobility. \n\nDuring the 17th century, however, the meaning and use of the word began to change. ''Generosity'' came increasingly to identify not literal family heritage but a nobility of spirit thought to be associated with high birth\u2014that is, with various admirable qualities that could now vary from person to person, depending not on family history but on whether a person actually possessed the qualities. In this way ''generosity'' increasingly came in the 17th century to signify a variety of traits of character and action historically associated (whether accurately or not) with the ideals of actual nobility: gallantry, courage, strength, richness, gentleness, and fairness. In addition to describing these diverse human qualities, ''generous'' became a word during this period used to describe fertile land, the strength of animal breeds, abundant provisions of food, vibrancy of colors, the strength of liquor, and the potency of medicine.\n\nThen, during the 18th century, the meaning of ''generosity'' continued to evolve in directions denoting the more specific, contemporary meaning of munificence, open\u2013handedness, and liberality in the giving of money and possessions to others. This more specific meaning came to dominate English usage by the 19th century. Over the last five centuries in the English speaking world, ''generosity'' developed from being primarily the description of an [[ascribed status]] pertaining to the elite nobility to being an achieved mark of admirable personal quality and action capable of being exercised in theory by any person who had learned virtue and noble character (Smith 2009).\n\n==In religion==\n[[File:Flickr - The U.S. Army - www.Army.mil (177).jpg|thumb|Members of the [[1st Sustainment Command (Theater)|US Army 1st Sustainment Command]] wrap [[Gift|Christmas gifts]] for soldiers stationed in or passing through [[Kuwait]], 2008]]\nIn [[Buddhism]], generosity is one of the [[Ten Perfections]] and is the [[antidote]] to the self-chosen [[poison]] called ''greed''. Generosity is known as [[d\u0101na]] in the Eastern religious scriptures.\n\nIn [[Islam]], Quran states that whatever one gives away generously, with the intention of pleasing God, He will replace it. God knows what is in the hearts of men.

In the first quarter, the Tigers scored via a 13-yard pass from [[Joe Burrow]] to [[Ja'Marr Chase]], a one-yard run by [[Clyde Edwards-Helaire]], and a nine-yard pass from Burrow to [[Justin Jefferson]]. To start the second quarter, they scored with two touchdown passes from Burrow to [[Terrace Marshall Jr.]], first from eight yards out and then from three yards out. Georgia Southern converted a 47-yard field goal with 5:13 left in the second quarter for their only points of the day. In the final minute of the first half, Burrow threw his fifth touchdown pass of the day, and third to Marshall Jr., from 11 yards out. This tied the LSU school record for single-game touchdown passes. Burrow was given one possession at the start of the second half to try and break the record, but the drive ended in a 39-yard field goal, and Burrow sat the remainder of the game. Backup quarterback Myles Brennan led another touchdown drive in the third quarter, ending in a two-yard touchdown run by Lanard Fournette. In the fourth quarter, kicker Cade York converted a 48-yard field goal to end the scoring for the day.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.espn.com/college-football/playbyplay?gameId=401110725|title=Georgia Southern vs. LSU \u2013 Play-By-Play|website=ESPN.com|date=August 31, 2019}}</ref><ref name=\"Ga Southern AP\">{{cite web |title=Burrow throws for 5 TDs, No. 6 LSU beats Ga.

After a closer-than-expected first half, LSU pulled away for a decisive 65\u201314 victory. It was the 800th win in LSU program history.\n\nNorthwestern State received the opening kickoff, and their first drive ended with a failed fourth-and-seven attempt from the LSU 35 yard line. LSU's opening drive advanced to the Northwestern State eight yard line, but they settled for a 26-yard Cade York field goal. Northwestern State took the lead on the next drive with a 17-yard touchdown pass from Shelton Eppler to Quan Shorts. LSU responded with their own touchdown drive to reclaim the lead early in the second quarter via a four-yard run from [[Clyde Edwards-Helaire]]. LSU scored again shortly thereafter with a 14-yard touchdown pass from [[Joe Burrow]] to [[Terrace Marshall Jr.]] Northwestern State responded with another touchdown drive, ending with a 26-yard pass from Eppler to David Fitzwater to bring the score to 17\u201314 LSU. LSU's Edwards-Helaire scored again, this time from three yards out, with 3:27 remaining in the half. LSU's first play of its next possession ended with a Joe Burrow interception that was returned to their own 17 yard line, but Northwestern State missed a 35-yard field goal attempt to end the half. Some boos were heard as the home team headed to the locker room, with the score 24\u201314 at the half.<ref name=\"NWST recap\" />\n\nIn the second half, LSU removed all doubt by scoring touchdowns on each of their first four possessions and holding Northwestern State scoreless for the remainder of the game. The Tigers scored first with a five-yard touchdown run from Joe Burrow, then a six-yard touchdown pass from Burrow to Marshall Jr., then a four-yard touchdown run from John Emery Jr., after which Burrow was pulled from the game. Backup Myles Brennan led another touchdown drive, ending with a one-yard score by Tyrion Davis-Price, making the score 51\u201314 at the end of the third quarter. In the fourth quarter, the Tigers scored on a 54-yard punt return touchdown by Trey Palmer, and a two-yard touchdown run by Davis-Price.\n\nJoe Burrow completed 21 of 24 passes for 373 yards, two passing touchdowns, one interception, and a rushing touchdown.

football season]]. The Tigers played their home games at [[Tiger Stadium (LSU)|Tiger Stadium]] (nicknamed Death Valley) in [[Baton Rouge, Louisiana]], and competed in the West Division of the [[Southeastern Conference]] (SEC) where they were led by their third-year head coach [[Ed Orgeron]].\n\nLSU began the year ranked sixth in the preseason [[AP Poll]], and were projected to finish in second in the SEC West behind [[2019 Alabama Crimson Tide football team|Alabama]]. The Tigers secured an undefeated regular season that included wins over top-ten-ranked teams [[2019 Texas Longhorns football team|Texas]], [[2019 Florida Gators football team|Florida]], [[2019 Auburn Tigers football team|Auburn]], and Alabama. In the [[2019 SEC Championship Game|SEC Championship Game]], LSU defeated [[2019 Georgia Bulldogs football team|Georgia]] to win their first conference title since [[2011 LSU Tigers football team|2011]]. LSU was ranked No. 1 in the final [[2019 NCAA Division I FBS football rankings|College Football Playoff rankings]] of the season, earning them a spot in the national semi-final game to be played at the [[2019 Peach Bowl|Peach Bowl]]. They dominated fourth-ranked [[2019 Oklahoma Sooners football team|Oklahoma]] in that game, 63\u201328, to advance to the [[2020 College Football Playoff National Championship|CFP Championship Game]]. There, they defeated the defending national champions [[2019 Clemson Tigers football team|Clemson]], 42\u201325, to secure LSU's fourth claimed national title in school history, the second undefeated champion in the CFP era, and the second 15\u20130 season among any team in the modern era. Owing to their dominant performance against a historically difficult schedule, several pundits have called the team the greatest in college football history.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://collegefootballnews.com/2020/01/lsu-greatest-season-ever-college-football-150-national-championship-all-time-season-rankings/8|title=LSU Greatest Season Ever?

He was accompanied on offense by 1,400-yard running back [[Clyde Edwards-Helaire]], and two 1,500-yard receivers [[Ja'Marr Chase]] and [[Justin Jefferson]], the former winning the [[Biletnikoff Award]] as the best wide receiver in the country. LSU's defense was anchored by two All-American defensive backs in [[Jim Thorpe Award]] winner [[Grant Delpit]] and true freshman [[Derek Stingley Jr.]] Linebacker [[Jacob Phillips]] led the SEC in tackles.

LSU won in a rout, 55\u20133. \n\nLSU received the opening kick-off, and scored touchdowns on each of their first five possessions. In the first quarter, the Tigers scored via a 13-yard pass from [[Joe Burrow]] to [[Ja'Marr Chase]], a one-yard run by [[Clyde Edwards-Helaire]], and a nine-yard pass from Burrow to [[Justin Jefferson]]. To start the second quarter, they scored with two touchdown passes from Burrow to [[Terrace Marshall Jr.]], first from eight yards out and then from three yards out. Georgia Southern converted a 47-yard field goal with 5:13 left in the second quarter for their only points of the day. In the final minute of the first half, Burrow threw his fifth touchdown pass of the day, and third to Marshall Jr., from 11 yards out. This tied the LSU school record for single-game touchdown passes. Burrow was given one possession at the start of the second half to try and break the record, but the drive ended in a 39-yard field goal, and Burrow sat the remainder of the game. Backup quarterback Myles Brennan led another touchdown drive in the third quarter, ending in a two-yard touchdown run by Lanard Fournette.

One difference, however, was that whereas Mason usually exculpated his clients at a pretrial hearing, Matlock usually secured an acquittal at trial, from the jury.<ref>{{cite news|title= Matlock \u2013 The First Season |work=[[DVD Talk]]|url= http://www.dvdtalk.com/reviews/32891/matlock-the-first-season/|accessdate=February 4, 2011}}</ref> Since 1991, reruns of the show have been shown in syndication and on [[Turner Broadcasting System|TBS]], [[INSP (TV channel)|INSP]], [[Hallmark Channel]], [[CBS Drama]], [[WGN America]], [[FETV]] and [[MeTV]].\n\n==Premise==\nThe show centers on widower [[Ben Matlock|Benjamin Leighton \"Ben\" Matlock]] (played by [[Andy Griffith]]), a renowned, folksy and popular though cantankerous attorney.  Usually, at the end of the case, the person who is on the stand being questioned by Matlock is the actual perpetrator, and Matlock will expose him/her, despite making clear that his one goal is to prove [[reasonable doubt]] in the case of his client's [[Guilt (law)|guilt]] or to prove his client's innocence.\n\nMatlock studied law at [[Harvard Law School|Harvard]], and after several years as a public defender, established his law practice in [[Atlanta]], living in a modest farmhouse in a neighboring suburb. He is known to visit crime scenes to discover clues otherwise overlooked and come up with viable, alternative theories of the crime in question (usually murder). Matlock also has conspicuously finicky fashion sense; he generally appears in court wearing a trademark light gray suit and, over the series' entire run, owned three generations of the [[Ford Motor Company|Ford]] [[Ford Crown Victoria|Crown Victoria]]\u2014always an all-gray model (Griffith's character had always driven Ford products in his 1960s series, ''[[The Andy Griffith Show]]'').\n\nMatlock is noted for his thrift and a fondness for hot dogs. In episode 158 (\"The Diner\"), hot dogs are revealed to have been his favorite dish since he was a young man. In contrast, after the series ended, his penchant for hot dogs was explained in the 1997 episode \"Murder Two\" of Joyce Burditt's ''[[Diagnosis: Murder]]''. Matlock blames [[List of Diagnosis: Murder characters#Mark Sloan|Dr. Mark Sloan]] (played by [[Dick Van Dyke]]) for recommending a disastrous investment in [[Stereo 8|8-track cartridges]], in which he lost his savings of $5,000 in 1969, forcing him into wearing cheap suits and living on hot dogs.\n\nDespite his thrift, Matlock's standard fee is $100,000, usually paid up front, but if he or his staff believe strongly enough in the innocence of a client, or if the client is unable to pay immediately (if at all), he has them pay over time, or reduces the fee significantly or waives it entirely, albeit reluctantly in some cases. He also, reluctantly, takes a ''[[pro bono]]'' case occasionally. These traits, and the demands he placed upon his investigators, are often points of comic relief in the series.\n\n==Cast==\n{{see also|List of Matlock characters}}\n\n===Main===\n* [[Andy Griffith]] as [[Ben Matlock]]\n* [[Linda Purl]] ([[Lori Lethin]] in pilot) as Charlene Matlock (season 1), Ben's younger daughter who became a partner to her father before she moved to Philadelphia to set up her own law practice\n* [[Alice Hirson]] as Hazel (pilot), Matlock's secretary\n* [[Kene Holliday]] as Tyler Hudson (seasons 1\u20133), Ben's first private investigator\n* [[Kari Lizer]] as Cassie Phillips (season 2), Ben's young file clerk who desired to become partner after Charlene's departure\n* [[Nancy Stafford]] as Michelle Thomas (seasons 2\u20136), an American lawyer living in London who becomes an equal partner to Matlock\n* [[Julie Sommars]] as Julie March (seasons 3\u20136), a district attorney who becomes a good friend to Ben Matlock\n* [[Clarence Gilyard|Clarence Gilyard Jr.]] as Conrad McMasters (seasons 4\u20137), Ben's second private investigator who is a former deputy sheriff and a rodeo rider\n* [[Brynn Thayer]] as Leanne MacIntyre (seasons 7\u20138), Ben's older daughter who works for her father after Michelle's departure\n* [[Daniel Roebuck]] as Cliff Lewis (seasons 7\u20139), Ben's last partner and private investigator who graduated from law school, the son of Ben's childhood friend, Billy Lewis\n* [[Carol Huston]] as Jerri Stone (season 9), Ben's last assistant and private investigator with a talent for singing lullabies\n\n===Recurring===\n* [[James McEachin]] as Lieutenant Frank Daniels (season 1), Ben's contact on the [[Atlanta Police Department]]\n* [[Michael Durrell]] as District Attorney Lloyd Burgess (seasons 1\u20136), chief district attorney for [[Fulton County, Georgia|Fulton County]]\n* [[David Froman]] as Lieutenant Bob Brooks (seasons 1\u20136), Ben's contact on the [[Atlanta Police Department]]\n* [[Don Knotts]] as Les \"Ace\" Calhoun (seasons 3\u20136), Ben's next-door neighbor who was once a client in season three\n* [[Warren Frost]] as Billy Lewis (seasons 6\u20139), Ben's childhood friend and Cliff's father\n\n==Changes==\n[[File:Matlock original cast 1986 season 1.jpg|thumb|Original cast ''(from left)'': [[Kene Holliday]], [[Andy Griffith]], and [[Linda Purl]]]]\nOriginally, the series premiered with Ben Matlock having a law practice with his daughter Charlene (played originally by Lori Lethin in the pilot movie; Linda Purl took over the role when the series went to air in the first season). Matlock also employed Tyler Hudson (played by [[Kene Holliday]]), a stock market whiz, as a [[private investigator]]. Tyler would often go undercover for Matlock in various guises to gather information. Matlock's most frequent prosecutorial adversary was Nebraska native Julie March (played by [[Julie Sommars]]). Although the two had a professional rivalry\u2014with Julie being a prosecutor and Matlock a defense lawyer\u2014their relationship outside of court was very cordial and the two often spent time together outside of court with occasional flirtations.\n\nToward the end of the first season, Matlock also took on Cassie Phillips (played by [[Kari Lizer]]), a cocky young law student, as an office worker. After the first season ended, Linda Purl departed from the series and lawyer-daughter Charlene was written out of the series by having moved to [[Philadelphia]] to start her own law practice. To begin the second season, Matlock went to England to try a case and met Michelle Thomas (played by [[Nancy Stafford]]), a young American lawyer living in [[London]]. After the case was over, Michelle followed Matlock back to the U.S. and took over Charlene's role as his law partner. Cassie stayed on as a file clerk until the end of the season, when she disappeared for reasons never made clear. With Lizer's departure, Julie Sommars then became a regular cast member.\n\n[[File:Matlock cast season 2 1987.jpg|thumb|left|Cast of season 2, ''from left'': ''(top)'' [[Kene Holliday]], [[Julie Sommars]]; ''(bottom)'' [[Kari Lizer]], [[Andy Griffith|Griffith]], [[Nancy Stafford]]]]\nSeveral actors appeared in the series as different characters prior to becoming regular cast members. In season one's \"The Seduction,\" Nancy Stafford played the role of Caryn Nelson/Carole Nathan, a high-class prostitute, who was paid off for [[perjury]] against Matlock's client. Also in that season, in \"The Angel,\" Kari Lizer had her first appearance as Matlock's client, Margaret Danello, a pop star called \"Angel.\" Also, actor Daniel Roebuck played a young physician, Dr. Bobby Shaw in \"The Doctors,\" then, lawyer Alex Winthrop in season three's 2-part episode: \"The Ambassador,\" and \"The Priest\", and a prosecutor in a 2-pt episode: \"The Assassination,\" before later becoming a cast regular playing Cliff Lewis in season seven.\n\nSome actors appeared as a different character in each appearance on the show. For example, [[Carolyn Seymour]] played Christina Harrison Ward in season one (\"The Affair\", episode 4), Dr. Vanessa Sedgwick in season two (\"The Genius\", episode 20), and Iris Vogel in season three (\"The Psychic\", episode 13). [[Nana Visitor]] and [[Roddy McDowall]] made several guest appearances as well.\n\nAfter season three, Kene Holliday was fired. Matlock hired a young, former [[North Carolina]] deputy sheriff, Conrad McMasters (played by [[Clarence Gilyard, Jr.]]), to be his new [[detective|private detective]]. Like Tyler, Conrad would also go undercover to gather information about cases. However, the two characters were different in their personalities and approach to the job. Tyler was a stocktrader and carried himself with something of an aristocratic air, whereas Conrad had more of a blue collar, working man attitude.  Matlock and McMasters became good friends as they were alike in many ways. Also during this period, [[Don Knotts]], Andy Griffith's old co-star as Deputy Barney Fife on ''[[The Andy Griffith Show]],'' began making frequent appearances as \"Ace\" Calhoun, Matlock's annoying next-door neighbor.\n\nBefore Brynn Thayer appeared in the 1992 episode \"The Vacation\" as Ben Matlock's other (and to that point unmentioned) daughter Leanne MacIntyre, who had become a prosecutor in [[Philadelphia]] and who had married and divorced, she first appeared in an earlier season's story \"The Suspect\", in 1991, in which she played Roxanne Windemere, a character with whom Ben became smitten. She joined the cast full-time in the season of 1992 playing a similar role to Linda Purl's character of lawyer-daughter Charlene of the first season (sister to Thayer's character Leanne McIntyre). Daniel Roebuck now joined Thayer as a new regular for season seven, playing the role of ne'er-do-well Cliff Lewis, a young lawyer and associate.  [[Warren Frost]] also joined the cast in a recurring role as Cliff's father Billy, an old nemesis from Matlock's past, as Ben had stood his sister up at the altar to pursue his law degree.\n\nThe move that year of 1992, now being telecast on [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] for the last three seasons to 1995, caused a fair amount of cast turnover as Nancy Stafford now left the series to spend more time with her husband, and Julie Sommars soon followed, although she would play a recurring role in several occasional later episodes, while [[Don Knotts|Don Knotts']] character was cut from the series. Clarence Gilyard Jr. remained on, but with the addition of Roebuck to the cast as the character Cliff Lewis, his role was diminished somewhat. After season seven, Gilyard left to play [[Texas Ranger Division|Texas Ranger]] Jimmy Trivette on the new series ''[[Walker, Texas Ranger]]'' with star [[Chuck Norris]].\n\n''Matlock'' had largely become, like Silverman and Hargrove's ''[[Perry Mason]]'' older TV series revival, a \"movie-of-the-week\" type series by season nine. Part of the reason for this was Griffith's advancing age, as he was nearing age 70 and wanted to spend more time with his family. Before that season, Brynn Thayer departed from the series and Leanne was mysteriously never heard from again. In season nine [[Carol Huston]] joined the series as Jerri Stone, a secondary private investigator helping out Cliff in his duties. Like Conrad McMasters, Jerri and Matlock had shared hobbies including singing.\n\nCoinciding with the move to the [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] network was also a change in filming venues. After taping in [[California]] for its entire previous run on [[NBC]], requiring Griffith to commute from his longtime home in [[North Carolina]] to the West Coast, ABC moved production to the [[EUE Screen Gems Studios|DEG Film Studios]] in [[Wilmington, North Carolina|Wilmington]] to ease the travel burden on Griffith. Many viewers and media critics lauded the new atmosphere of different geographical locations and \"out-of-Hollywood\" venues breathing some new life into the crime/lawyer/legal/court scenes. The ''[[Perry Mason]]''-style of \"[[whodunit]]\" format was also adjusted to a more [[Columbo (TV series)|Columbo]] TV series-style \"[[howcatchem]]\" format.\n\nAlthough never officially confirmed, a widespread rumor suggests that the character of Ben Matlock was based on colorful lawyer [[Bobby Lee Cook]], known as the \"dean of [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]] criminal defense attorneys.\" Cook, whose practice is based not in Atlanta but in a small mountain town, has been an attorney since the 1940s and has gained an international reputation for his success in criminal and civil cases.\n\n==Episodes==\n{{Main|List of Matlock episodes}}\n''Matlock'' aired a total of 193 episodes across nine seasons and began with a TV-movie. Twelve two-hour and fifteen two-part episodes of the program were aired. Six of the episodes were clip shows with mostly minor plots that paved the way for scenes from previous stories. Although, numerically, Griffith appeared in more episodes portraying Sheriff Andy Taylor in ''The Andy Griffith Show'', he logged more on-screen time as Ben Matlock due to the length of each show.\n{{:List of Matlock episodes}}\n\n==Program format==\nA few changes were made in the format of the introduction of the episodes. The introduction of characters was essentially the same, the only changes being the actors for each season. Andy Griffith, Linda Purl, Kene Holliday, Nancy Stafford, Clarence Gilyard Jr., Brynn Thayer, Julie Sommars, Kari Lizer, Daniel Roebuck, and Carol Huston were all featured in the intros for their seasons.\n\nThe ''Matlock'' commercial screen also changed. The early episodes had a scene of Ben Matlock in front of a brown screen; around 1987, this was changed to gray. In 1992, this was changed once again to the same gray, but with a blue square around the \"M\" in \"Matlock\". Later in the 1993\u201394 season, the commercial screen was removed.\n\n===Spinoffs===\n''[[Jake and the Fatman]]'' was a spin-off on CBS, based on a character who originated in \"The Don\" (1986) a two-part ''Matlock'' episode from season one. [[William Conrad]] played prosecutor James L. McShane and [[Joe Penny]] played Paul Baron, the son of Matlock's client. Executive producers [[Fred Silverman]] and [[Dean Hargrove]] were responsible for both ''Matlock'' and ''Jake and the Fatman'', as well as ''[[Diagnosis: Murder]]'', created by Joyce Burditt (which itself was a spin-off of ''Jake and the Fatman'') in 1993, also on CBS; ''[[Father Dowling Mysteries]]'' in 1988 on NBC and ABC; and the 30 ''[[Perry Mason (TV series)|Perry Mason]]'' made-for-TV movies from 1985 until 1995 on NBC.\n\n===In popular culture===\n\nThe series is a favorite of [[Homer Simpson]]'s father [[Abe Simpson|Abe]] on ''[[The Simpsons]]''. In [[Whacking Day|one episode]] Abe Simpson says, \"I'm an old man. I hate everything but ''Matlock''.\" Part of this quote was adopted as a song title by [[Finnish people|Finnish]] band [[Liimanarina]].<ref name=\"Cox, 2015\">{{cite

York Times|date=September 23, 1986|url= https://www.nytimes.com/1986/09/23/arts/2-new-series-matlock-and-sledge-hammer.html|accessdate=October 22, 2010|first=John J.|last=O'Connor}}</ref> The show, produced by Intermedia Entertainment Company (first season only), The [[Fred Silverman]] Company, [[Dean Hargrove]] Productions, and [[Viacom Productions]], originally aired from  March 3, 1986 to May 8, 1992 on [[NBC]]; and from November 5, 1992 until May 7, 1995 on [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]].\n\nThe show's format is similar to that of [[CBS]]'s ''[[Perry Mason (TV series)|Perry Mason]]'' (with both ''Matlock'' and the 1980s  ''Perry Mason'' TV movies  created by [[Dean Hargrove]]), with Matlock identifying the perpetrators and then confronting them in dramatic courtroom scenes. One difference, however, was that whereas Mason usually exculpated his clients at a pretrial hearing, Matlock usually secured an acquittal at trial, from the jury.<ref>{{cite news|title= Matlock \u2013 The First Season |work=[[DVD Talk]]|url= http://www.dvdtalk.com/reviews/32891/matlock-the-first-season/|accessdate=February 4, 2011}}</ref> Since 1991, reruns of the show have been shown in syndication and on [[Turner Broadcasting System|TBS]], [[INSP (TV channel)|INSP]], [[Hallmark Channel]], [[CBS Drama]], [[WGN America]], [[FETV]] and [[MeTV]].\n\n==Premise==\nThe show centers on widower [[Ben Matlock|Benjamin Leighton \"Ben\" Matlock]] (played by [[Andy Griffith]]), a renowned, folksy and popular though cantankerous attorney.  Usually, at the end of the case, the person who is on the stand being questioned by Matlock is the actual perpetrator, and Matlock will expose him/her, despite making clear that his one goal is to prove [[reasonable doubt]] in the case of his client's [[Guilt (law)|guilt]] or to prove his client's innocence.\n\nMatlock studied law at [[Harvard Law School|Harvard]], and after several years as a public defender, established his law practice in [[Atlanta]], living in a modest farmhouse in a neighboring suburb. He is known to visit crime scenes to discover clues otherwise overlooked and come up with viable, alternative theories of the crime in question (usually murder). Matlock also has conspicuously finicky fashion sense; he generally appears in court wearing a trademark light gray suit and, over the series' entire run, owned three generations of the [[Ford Motor Company|Ford]] [[Ford Crown Victoria|Crown Victoria]]\u2014always an all-gray model (Griffith's character had always driven Ford products in his 1960s series, ''[[The Andy Griffith Show]]'').\n\nMatlock is noted for his thrift and a fondness for hot dogs. In episode 158 (\"The Diner\"), hot dogs are revealed to have been his favorite dish since he was a young man. In contrast, after the series ended, his penchant for hot dogs was explained in the 1997 episode \"Murder Two\" of Joyce Burditt's ''[[Diagnosis: Murder]]''. Matlock blames [[List of Diagnosis: Murder characters#Mark Sloan|Dr. Mark Sloan]] (played by [[Dick Van Dyke]]) for recommending a disastrous investment in [[Stereo 8|8-track cartridges]], in which he lost his savings of $5,000 in 1969, forcing him into wearing cheap suits and living on hot dogs.\n\nDespite his thrift, Matlock's standard fee is $100,000, usually paid up front, but if he or his staff believe strongly enough in the innocence of a client, or if the client is unable to pay immediately (if at all), he has them pay over time, or reduces the fee significantly or waives it entirely, albeit reluctantly in some cases. He also, reluctantly, takes a ''[[pro bono]]'' case occasionally. These traits, and the demands he placed upon his investigators, are often points of comic relief in the series.\n\n==Cast==\n{{see also|List of Matlock characters}}\n\n===Main===\n* [[Andy Griffith]] as [[Ben Matlock]]\n* [[Linda Purl]] (Lori Lethin in pilot) as Charlene Matlock (season 1), Ben's younger daughter who became a partner to her father before she moved to Philadelphia to set up her own law practice\n* [[Alice Hirson]] as Hazel (pilot), Matlock's secretary\n* [[Kene Holliday]] as Tyler Hudson (seasons 1\u20133), Ben's first private investigator\n* [[Kari Lizer]] as Cassie Phillips (season 2), Ben's young file clerk who desired to become partner after Charlene's departure\n* [[Nancy Stafford]] as Michelle Thomas (seasons 2\u20136), an American lawyer living in London who becomes an equal partner to Matlock\n* [[Julie Sommars]] as Julie March (seasons 3\u20136), a district attorney who becomes a good friend to Ben Matlock\n* [[Clarence Gilyard|Clarence Gilyard Jr.]] as Conrad McMasters (seasons 4\u20137), Ben's second private investigator who is a former deputy sheriff and a rodeo rider\n* [[Brynn Thayer]] as Leanne MacIntyre (seasons 7\u20138), Ben's older daughter who works for her father after Michelle's departure\n* [[Daniel Roebuck]] as Cliff Lewis (seasons 7\u20139), Ben's last partner and private investigator who graduated from law school, the son of Ben's childhood friend, Billy Lewis\n* [[Carol Huston]] as Jerri Stone (season 9), Ben's last assistant and private investigator with a talent for singing lullabies\n\n===Recurring===\n* [[James McEachin]] as Lieutenant Frank Daniels (season 1), Ben's contact on the [[Atlanta Police Department]]\n* [[Michael Durrell]] as District Attorney Lloyd Burgess (seasons 1\u20136), chief district attorney for [[Fulton County, Georgia|Fulton County]]\n* [[David Froman]] as Lieutenant Bob Brooks (seasons 1\u20136), Ben's contact on the [[Atlanta Police Department]]\n* [[Don Knotts]] as Les \"Ace\" Calhoun (seasons 3\u20136), Ben's next-door neighbor who was once a client in season three\n* [[Warren Frost]] as Billy Lewis (seasons 6\u20139), Ben's childhood friend and Cliff's father\n\n==Changes==\n[[File:Matlock original cast 1986 season 1.jpg|thumb|Original cast ''(from left)'': [[Kene Holliday]], [[Andy Griffith]], and [[Linda Purl]]]]\nOriginally, the series premiered with Ben Matlock having a law practice with his daughter Charlene (played originally by Lori Lethin in the pilot movie; Linda Purl took over the role when the series went to air in the first season). Matlock also employed Tyler Hudson (played by [[Kene Holliday]]), a stock market whiz, as a [[private investigator]]. Tyler would often go undercover for Matlock in various guises to gather information. Matlock's most frequent prosecutorial adversary was Nebraska native Julie March (played by [[Julie Sommars]]). Although the two had a professional rivalry\u2014with Julie being a prosecutor and Matlock a defense lawyer\u2014their relationship outside of court was very cordial and the two often spent time together outside of court with occasional flirtations.\n\nToward the end of the first season, Matlock also took on Cassie Phillips (played by [[Kari Lizer]]), a cocky young law student, as an office worker. After the first season ended, Linda Purl departed from the series and lawyer-daughter Charlene was written out of the series by having moved to [[Philadelphia]] to start her own law practice. To begin the second season, Matlock went to England to try a case and met Michelle Thomas (played by [[Nancy Stafford]]), a young American lawyer living in [[London]]. After the case was over, Michelle followed Matlock back to the U.S. and took over Charlene's role as his law partner. Cassie stayed on as a file clerk until the end of the season, when she disappeared for reasons never made clear. With Lizer's departure, Julie Sommars then became a regular cast member.\n\n[[File:Matlock cast season 2 1987.jpg|thumb|left|Cast of season 2, ''from left'': ''(top)'' [[Kene Holliday]], [[Julie Sommars]]; ''(bottom)'' [[Kari Lizer]], [[Andy Griffith|Griffith]], [[Nancy Stafford]]]]\nSeveral actors appeared in the series as different characters prior to becoming regular cast members. In season one's \"The Seduction,\" Nancy Stafford played the role of Caryn Nelson/Carole Nathan, a high-class prostitute, who was paid off for [[perjury]] against Matlock's client. Also in that season, in \"The Angel,\" Kari Lizer had her first appearance as Matlock's client, Margaret Danello, a pop star called \"Angel.\" Also, actor Daniel Roebuck played a young physician, Dr. Bobby Shaw in \"The Doctors,\" then, lawyer Alex Winthrop in season three's 2-part episode: \"The Ambassador,\" and \"The Priest\", and a prosecutor in a 2-pt episode: \"The Assassination,\" before later becoming a cast regular playing Cliff Lewis in season seven.\n\nSome actors appeared as a different character in each appearance on the show. For example, [[Carolyn Seymour]] played Christina Harrison Ward in season one (\"The Affair\", episode 4), Dr. Vanessa Sedgwick in season two (\"The Genius\", episode 20), and Iris Vogel in season three (\"The Psychic\", episode 13). [[Nana Visitor]] and [[Roddy McDowall]] made several guest appearances as well.\n\nAfter season three, Kene Holliday was fired. Matlock hired a young, former [[North Carolina]] deputy sheriff, Conrad McMasters (played by [[Clarence Gilyard, Jr.]]), to be his new [[detective|private detective]]. Like Tyler, Conrad would also go undercover to gather information about cases. However, the two characters were different in their personalities and approach to the job. Tyler was a stocktrader and carried himself with something of an aristocratic air, whereas Conrad had more of a blue collar, working man attitude.  Matlock and McMasters became good friends as they were alike in many ways. Also during this period, [[Don Knotts]], Andy Griffith's old co-star as Deputy Barney Fife on ''[[The Andy Griffith Show]],'' began making frequent appearances as \"Ace\" Calhoun, Matlock's annoying next-door neighbor.\n\nBefore Brynn Thayer appeared in the 1992 episode \"The Vacation\" as Ben Matlock's other (and to that point unmentioned) daughter Leanne MacIntyre, who had become a prosecutor in [[Philadelphia]] and who had married and divorced, she first appeared in an earlier season's story \"The Suspect\", in 1991, in which she played Roxanne Windemere, a character with whom Ben became smitten. She joined the cast full-time in the season of 1992 playing a similar role to Linda Purl's character of lawyer-daughter Charlene of the first season (sister to Thayer's character Leanne McIntyre). Daniel Roebuck now joined Thayer as a new regular for season seven, playing the role of ne'er-do-well Cliff Lewis, a young lawyer and associate.  [[Warren Frost]] also joined the cast in a recurring role as Cliff's father Billy, an old nemesis from Matlock's past, as Ben had stood his sister up at the altar to pursue his law degree.\n\nThe move that year of 1992, now being telecast on [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] for the last three seasons to 1995, caused a fair amount of cast turnover as Nancy Stafford now left the series to spend more time with her husband, and Julie Sommars soon followed, although she would play a recurring role in several occasional later episodes, while [[Don Knotts|Don Knotts']] character was cut from the series. Clarence Gilyard Jr. remained on, but with the addition of Roebuck to the cast as the character Cliff Lewis, his role was diminished somewhat. After season seven, Gilyard left to play [[Texas Ranger Division|Texas Ranger]] Jimmy Trivette on the new series ''[[Walker, Texas Ranger]]'' with star [[Chuck Norris]].\n\n''Matlock'' had largely become, like Silverman and Hargrove's ''[[Perry Mason]]'' older TV series revival, a \"movie-of-the-week\" type series by season nine. Part of the reason for this was Griffith's advancing age, as he was nearing age 70 and wanted to spend more time with his family. Before that season, Brynn Thayer departed from the series and Leanne was mysteriously never heard from again. In season nine [[Carol Huston]] joined the series as Jerri Stone, a secondary private investigator helping out Cliff in his duties. Like Conrad McMasters, Jerri and Matlock had shared hobbies including singing.\n\nCoinciding with the move to the [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] network was also a change in filming venues. After taping in [[California]] for its entire previous run on [[NBC]], requiring Griffith to commute from his longtime home in [[North Carolina]] to the West Coast, ABC moved production to the [[EUE Screen Gems Studios|DEG Film Studios]] in [[Wilmington, North Carolina|Wilmington]] to ease the travel burden on Griffith. Many viewers and media critics lauded the new atmosphere of different geographical locations and \"out-of-Hollywood\" venues breathing some new life into the crime/lawyer/legal/court scenes. The ''[[Perry Mason]]''-style of \"[[whodunit]]\" format was also adjusted to a more [[Columbo (TV series)|Columbo]] TV series-style \"[[howcatchem]]\" format.\n\nAlthough never officially confirmed, a widespread rumor suggests that the character of Ben Matlock was based on colorful lawyer [[Bobby Lee Cook]], known as the \"dean of [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]] criminal defense attorneys.\" Cook, whose practice is based not in Atlanta but in a small mountain town, has been an attorney since the 1940s and has gained an international reputation for his success in criminal and civil cases.\n\n==Episodes==\n{{Main|List of Matlock episodes}}\n''Matlock'' aired a total of 193 episodes across nine seasons and began with a TV-movie. Twelve two-hour and fifteen two-part episodes of the program were aired. Six of the episodes were clip shows with mostly minor plots that paved the way for scenes from previous stories. Although, numerically, Griffith appeared in more episodes portraying Sheriff Andy Taylor in ''The Andy Griffith Show'', he logged more on-screen time as Ben Matlock due to the length of each show.\n{{:List of Matlock episodes}}\n\n==Program format==\nA few changes were made in the format of the introduction of the episodes.

Andy Griffith, Linda Purl, Kene Holliday, Nancy Stafford, Clarence Gilyard Jr., Brynn Thayer, Julie Sommars, Kari Lizer, Daniel Roebuck, and Carol Huston were all featured in the intros for their seasons.\n\nThe ''Matlock'' commercial screen also changed. The early episodes had a scene of Ben Matlock in front of a brown screen; around 1987, this was changed to gray. In 1992, this was changed once again to the same gray, but with a blue square around the \"M\" in \"Matlock\". Later in the 1993\u201394 season, the commercial screen was removed.\n\n===Spinoffs===\n''[[Jake and the Fatman]]'' was a spin-off on CBS, based on a character who originated in \"The Don\" (1986) a two-part ''Matlock'' episode from season one. [[William Conrad]] played prosecutor James L. McShane and [[Joe Penny]] played Paul Baron, the son of Matlock's client.
