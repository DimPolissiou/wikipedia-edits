{"title_page": "List of attacks related to secondary schools", "text_new": "{{short description|Wikimedia list article}}\nThis is a '''list of attacks related to secondary schools''' that have occurred around the world. These are attacks that have occurred on school property or related primarily to school issues or events. A narrow definition of the word ''attacks'' is used for this list so as to exclude warfare, robberies, gang violence, public attacks (as in political protests), accidental shootings, and [[suicide]]s and [[murder\u2013suicide]]s by rejected spouses or suitors. Incidents that involved only staff who work at the school have been classified as belonging at [[List of rampage killers|List of workplace killings]]. It also excludes events where no injuries take place, if an attack is foiled.\n\nThe listed attacks include [[shooting]]s, [[stabbing]]s, [[Cutting|slashings]], [[bombing]]s, and [[Battery (crime)|beatings]] administered with [[blunt instrument]]s.\n\n==Secondary school incidents==\n\n===1850s===\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"font-size:90%;\"\n|-\n! style=\"width:65px;\"| Date\n! style=\"width:85px;\"| Location\n! style=\"width:75px;\"| Attacker(s)\n! data-sort-type=\"number\" style=\"width:75px;\"| Dead{{r|group=lower-alpha|note_a}}\n! data-sort-type=\"number\" style=\"width:75px;\"| Injured{{r|group=lower-alpha|note_a}}\n!

{"title_page": "Persecutions of the Catholic Church and Pius XII", "text_new": "{{Main article|Pope Pius XII}}\n{{Modern persecutions of the Catholic Church}}\nPersecutions against the [[Catholic Church]] took place throughout the pontificate of [[Pope Pius XII]] (1939-1958). Pius' reign coincided with the [[World War II|Second World War]], the commencement of the [[Cold War]] and the accelerating European [[Decolonization of Africa|decolonisation]]. During this time, the Catholic Church faced persecution under [[Fascism|Fascist]] and [[Communism|Communist]] governments.\n\nThe Nazi persecution of the church was at its most extreme in [[German-occupied Poland|Occupied Poland]]. The defeat of Fascism at the end of [[World War Two|World War II]] ended one set of persecutions, but strengthened the position of Communism throughout the world, intensifying a further set of persecutions \u2013 notably in [[Eastern Europe]], the [[USSR]], and, later, the [[People's Republic of China]]. The Catholic Church was under attack in all [[Communist]] governed countries and lost most of its existence in [[Albania]], [[Bulgaria]], [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia]], [[Romania]], Communist China and the Soviet Union (including [[Estonia]], [[Latvia]] and [[Lithuania]]).\n\n== Summary ==\nThe pontificate of Pius XII coincided with the Second World War (1939-1945) and the early stages of the Cold War. The Catholic Church was repressed under the Nazi Empire and then under the Soviet dominated Communist states established in Eastern and Central Europe following the war. The Catholic Church in Germany was systematically repressed by the Nazis and persecution was at its most severe in Nazi occupied Poland, where churches, seminaries, monasteries and convents were systematically closed and thousands of priests and nuns were either murdered, imprisoned or deported.\n\nAccording to [[John Cornwell (writer)|John Cornwell]], the Church was faced with a dilemma: compromise with the governments in order to maintain a structure with which to survive, or resist or confront and risk annihilation.<ref name=\"Cornwell 333\">Cornwell 333</ref> To save its faithful, the Vatican attempted both at varying times.\n\nIn [[East Germany]] and [[Hungary]], the Church was subjected to ongoing attacks, but was able to continue some of its activities, however on a much reduced scale. In [[Albania]], [[Bulgaria]], [[Czechoslovakia]] and [[Hungary]], persecution continued to the point that the Church faced extinction. In the Soviet Union and mainland China, the Catholic Church largely ceased to exist, at least publicly, during the [[pontificate]] of Pope Pius XII.\n\n==Fascist persecutions==\n===Nazi persecutions===\n\n====Germany====\n\nThe Catholic Church had been a leading opponent of the rise of the [[National Socialist German Workers Party]] through the 1920s and early 1930s. Upon taking power in 1933, and despite the [[Reichskonkordat|Concordat]] it signed with the church promising the contrary, the Nazi Government of [[Adolf Hitler]] began suppressing the Catholic Church as part of an overall policy of to eliminate competing sources of authority. The Nazis arrested thousands of members of the German [[Centre Party (Germany)|Catholic Centre Party]] as well as Catholic clergymen and closed Catholic schools and institutions. As the [[Third Reich]] expanded, thousands more Catholic priests were imprisoned or killed and Catholic institutions disbanded by the Nazis.<ref>http://www.yadvashem.org/yv/en/holocaust/about/01/non_jews_persecution.asp</ref>\n\nAccording to Hitler's biographer [[Alan Bullock]], Hitler was a \"man who believed neither in God nor in conscience ('a Jewish invention, a blemish like circumcision')\".<ref>[[Alan Bullock]]; ''Hitler, a Study in Tyranny''; HarperPerennial Edition 1991; p216</ref> Bullock wrote: Hitler thought that Catholic teachings, taken to their conclusion, \"would mean the systematic cultivation of the human failure\".<ref>[[Alan Bullock]]; ''Hitler, a Study in Tyranny''; HarperPerennial Edition 1991; p218</ref> Bullock adds that \"once the war was over, [Hitler] promised himself, he would root out and destroy the influence of the Christian churches, but until then he would be circumspect\":<ref>[[Alan Bullock]]; ''Hitler, a Study in Tyranny''; HarperPerennial Edition 1991; p219</ref>\n\n{{quote|Hitler had been brought up a Catholic and was impressed by the organisation and power of the Church.

As previously with Germany under the National Socialist government, Pope Pius refused to break diplomatic relations with Communist authorities.<ref>Before 1939, as Secretary of State, he had debated this point with [[Pope Pius XI]]. Pacelli argued, that a break of diplomatic relations means losing all contacts with the local hierarchy and, eventually, paying a much higher price:\n\n* Pius XI asked me, how can the [[Holy See]]  keep its [[nuncio]] there?  This is against our honour. I answered: Your Holiness,  what do we do afterwards? How do we maintain any contacts with our bishops?  He understood and calmed down. (Actes et documents Vol II, p.424)</ref>\n\nThus, after World War II, the [[Holy See|Vatican]] kept its nuncios in Poland, Hungary, Yugoslavia, Czechoslovakia, [[Romania]] and China, until these countries severed relations, interrupting communication with bishops as well. The Vatican responded, by giving local bishops unprecedented authority to deal with authorities on their own, but without granting the right to define overall relations, viewed as the sole privilege of the Holy See.<ref>Letter of Monsignor Tardini to the Archbishop of Belgrad, 2 16, 1952, in HK VII, 1952 447</ref> In encyclicals such as ''[[Invicti athletae]]'', and Apostolic letters to Czech Bishops, Polish Bishops, the Bishops of Hungary, China, and Romania,<ref>Czechoslovakia AAS 1948 33, Poland AAS 1949 29,    Hungary AAS 1952 249, China AAS 1952 153, Romania AAS 1947, 223</ref> the Pope encouraged local bishops to be firm, modest and wise in their dealings with the new communist authorities.

Nevertheless, the Vatican was not successful in blocking episcopal enthronements by the governments of China and Czechoslovakia. These persons were not excommunicated, however. In his last encyclical [[Ad Apostolorum Principis]] to the bishops of China, Pope Pius XII expressed the opinion, that schismatic bishops and priests are the final step towards total elimination of the Catholic Church in that country.<ref>AAS 1958 601</ref> Questions were raised as to why the Vatican appointed powerful but often inexperienced American bishops as nuncios in some Eastern countries, given the anti-American, anti-imperialist tendencies in these countries.<ref>see Stehle, Ostpolitik</ref> While there is no documentation on Vatican motives, a possible reason could be the relative security of US nationals in foreign countries.\n\n=== Persecutions and Church policies ===\n==== China ====\n[[File:Sacr\u00e9-C\u0153ur de Shizhi.jpg|thumb|left|[[Sacred Heart Cathedral of Guangzhou]]]]\n{{Main article|Pope Pius XII and China}}\n\nFor centuries, access to the people of China was difficult for the Catholic Church, because it did not recognize local [[Confucian]] customs of honouring deceased family members. To the Chinese, this was an [[ancient]] [[ritual]], to the Vatican, it was a [[religious]] exercise which conflicted with [[Roman Catholic Church|Catholic]] [[dogma]]. As a result, the Church made little progress in China. Within month of his election, Pope Pius issued a dramatic change in policies. On 8 December 1939 the Sacred Congregation of the Propagation of Faith issued, at the request of Pius XII, a new instruction, by which Chinese customs were no longer considered [[superstitious]], but an honourable way of esteeming ones relatives and therefore permitted by Catholic Christians.<ref>Smit 186\u2013187.</ref> The [[Government of the Republic of China|Government of China]] established diplomatic relations with the Vatican in 1943, within a short interval.

This was less than one percent of the population but numbers increased dramatically. In 1949, there existed 20 archdioceses, 85 dioceses, 39 apostolic prefectures, 3080 foreign missionaries, 2557 Chinese priests.<ref>Giovanetti 230</ref>\n\nThe establishment of the [[People's Republic of China]] in 1949 put these early advances on hold and led to the [[persecution]] of thousands of clergy and faithful in China. A patriotic Chinese Church was formed. Since that time, the persecuted Catholic Church exists as a tiny fraction in secrecy and underground only. The losses were considerable. For example, in 1948, the Catholic Church operated some 254 orphanages and 196 hospitals with 81628 beds.<ref>Herder Korrespondenz 5, 201</ref> Catholic clergy experienced increased supervision.

However, pressures against the Church increased with the de facto outlawing of religious meetings and organizations.

The trumped up proceedings, fully reported in the West, gripped and horrified Catholics the world over.\"<ref name=\"Cornwell 333\"/> The Cardinal remained in prison until 1956, when, during the [[Hungarian Revolution of 1956|Hungarian Revolution]] he was freed. After the failure of the revolution, he lived in the American embassy for the following 15 years.\n\n==== Romania, Bulgaria and Albania ====\n[[File:Blaj s3.jpg|thumb|Sf\u00e2nta Treime Romanian Catholic Metropolitan Cathedral]]\n[[File:Blaj s2.jpg|thumb|The interior of the Sf\u00e2nta Treime Romanian Catholic Metropolitan Cathedral]]\n\nAfter World War I, Romania inherited large parts of Catholic Hungary including large Catholic populations, which were not always treated well between the wars.<ref>Adryani 530</ref> The [[Apostolic Constitution]] ''Solemmni Conventione'' of 1930 includes a [[concordat]] between Romania and the Vatican.<ref>AAS 1930, 381</ref> It allowed for four dioceses and free exercise of religion within the country. Because of rival interpretations the concordat was enacted ten years later in 1940. In 1948, the Communist government withdrew from the concordat and closed most Catholic institutes. Only two small dioceses were permitted to continue, the others were considered non-existent.<ref>Adrianyi,531</ref> The six united bishops and several Latin rite bishops were jailed to long sentences. All schools were closed, Catholic activities were outlawed.<ref>Adrianyi,532.</ref><ref>''[[Orientales Ecclesias]]'', Acta Apostolicae Sedis (AAS), Roma, Vaticano, 1953, 5.</ref>\n\nBulgaria became a [[People's Republic]] on 15 October 1946. The new [[constitution]] of 1947 limited religious activities. Massive Church persecution followed. The Church lost all its bishops, organizations, religious institutes. Most of the priests and religious perished within five years,<ref>Adrianyi, 536</ref> many of them in Siberia.\n\nIn Albania, the Communist government assumed the role of liberator, since the country was under [[Italy|Italian]] [[Military occupation|occupation]] since 1939. The Catholic Church was denounced as the Church of the [[oppression|oppressor]]s. All foreign priests and religious were expelled. Domestic bishops, priests and religious were killed, jailed or sent to unknown destinations. As in other countries, a peace-loving national Church was attempted as well. The government prided itself on having eradicated religion and closed every Catholic Church.<ref>Adrianyi,536</ref>\n\n==== Yugoslavia ====\nAfter defining relations with the [[Orthodox Church]] in 1929,  [[Muslim]]s in 1931, [[Protestant]]s and [[Jew]]s in 1933, a [[Concordat]] was signed in 1935 between Yugoslavia and the Vatican. After the Orthodox Church excommunicated all politicians involved in its parliamentary passing, the government withdrew the text from final vote in the upper house. De Facto however, the spirit of the concordat was accepted and the Church began to flourish in the years prior to World War II.<ref>Adrianyi,533</ref> The war was difficult for the Church, as the country was largely occupied by Italian and German forces. The [[Independent State of Croatia]], which declared independence from the [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia]], was open to the needs of the Church, which led to open [[collaboration]] of several Church officials with Croatian government policies.\n\nAfter the war, the systematic persecution of the Church began as it did in all the other socialist countries. Some 1300 of the clergy was assassinated among them 139 Franciscan friar, 50% of the clergy was jailed.<ref>Adrianyi,534</ref> As in Czechoslovakia and other countries, Belgrade created government-controlled organizations of priests, in an attempt to divide the clergy. A major bone of contention was [[Aloysius Stepinac]], who was elevated to the College of Cardinals in 1953. To President Tito \"a provocation\", this represented to Pope Pius \"a just recognition of his extraordinary merits and a symbol of our affection and encouragement for our beloved sons and daughters, who testify their faith with steadfastness and courage in very difficult times. The Pope explained that he did not intend to insult the Yugoslavian authorities, but neither did he agree with any of the unjust accusations which resulted in the punishment of the Archbishop.<ref>Pio XII Discorsi, 1952, January 12, 1953</ref> Stepinac was not permitted to receive the red hat in Rome, and remained under house arrest (unable to participate in the 1958 conclave) until his death in 1960. [[Pope John Paul II]] beatified him. After his death, relations to the Vatican improved significantly. In 1974, the Church in Yugoslavia counted 15500 priests, religious and nuns<ref>HK 1977,318\u2013324</ref>\n\n=== Persecution of religious institutes ===\n[[Religious institute]]s and institutions are historically visible targets in time of conflict and strife. Their houses, convents or monasteries were looted, burned or destroyed throughout Europe for centuries in virtually all European countries. The beginning of the pontificate of Pius XII coincided with the end of the Civil War in Spain, in which, in addition to thousands of faithful, some 4184 secular priests, 2365 religious and 283 female religious were killed within a three-year period.<ref>Dammertz 375</ref>\n\nIn World War II, the [[religious (Catholicism)|religious]] of Poland suffered from an exceptionally brutal German occupation. A 1940 thirteen-point program provided that \"all religious institutes, convents and monasteries will be closed because they do not reflect German morality and population policy.\"<ref>Dammertz 376</ref> The German policy, to treat Poles as subhuman \"Untermenschen\", was especially brutal against representatives of religious orders. [[Gestapo]] raids let to the murdering, assassination and deportation to concentration camps of numerous religious, including the Franciscan friar [[Maximilian Kolbe]].\n[[File:Chapel of Saint Kazimieras with his sarcophagus in Vilnius Cathedral.jpg|thumb|left|Chapel of [[Saint Casimir]] with his coffin in Vilnius, Lithuania]]\nIn the [[Dachau concentration camp]] alone, some 2800 Polish priests and religious were incarcerated, of whom approximately 1000 were killed or died of hunger. Between April and October 1942, 500 Polish religious died in Dachau, in part due to mistreatment, hunger or the gas chambers.<ref name=\"HK 1960, 27\">HK 1960, 27</ref> Long-time inmate Bishop Kozlowiecki reports: \"What a happy day, if I was beaten only once or twice\". Especially brutal was Holy Week in 1942. One thousand and eight hundred Polish priests and religious went through punishment drills and exercises uninterrupted from morning to night every day.<ref name=\"HK 1960, 27\"/> Pope Pius XII informed the cardinals in 1945 that among all the horrors, which priests and religious had to endure in concentration camps, the fate of Polish inmates was by far the worst.<ref>Pio XII, Discorsi VII, 1945,  Roma, Vaticano, 74</ref>\n\nAfter 1945, Poland was resurrected, but the Polish government continued the attacks against the Catholic Church. All religious were forced to leave hospitals and educational institutions, their properties were confiscated. Within seven years, fifty-four religious were killed. One hundred and seventy priests were deported to gulags.<ref>Dammertz 378</ref> However, after a change of government in 1956, the condition of the Church improved. Harassment and persecution of the Church continued but religious vocations were permitted and Poland became the only Eastern country which contributed in great numbers religious missionaries to worldwide service.<ref>Dammertz 379</ref>\n\nIn all East European countries, after World War II, persecution of religious assumed new dimensions. All religious houses in the Ukraine were confiscated and their inhabitants either jailed or sent home. All religious houses were confiscated and closed in Lithuania as well. In Albania, all religious orders were forcibly closed. In Bulgaria and Czechoslovakia, all monasteries and religious institutes were erased after 1950.<ref>Dammertz 377</ref> In Hungary, 10,000 members of religious orders were ordered to leave their residences within three months. Some 300 were permitted to remain.<ref>Dammertz 378</ref> The Hungarian hierarchy entered an agreement with the authorities, which permitted the reopening of eight Catholic schools<ref>Galter, 345\u2013353,</ref><ref>Herder Korrespondenz, 5, 1950, 33</ref>\n\nIn [[SFRY|Yugoslavia]], all orders were closed after the war and properties confiscated. In [[Bosnia (region)|Bosnia]], numerous religious figures were killed, among them 139 Franciscan priests. However, as Yugoslavia distanced itself increasingly from Moscow, significant improvements were noticed in [[Slovenia]] and [[Croatia]] during the last two years of the Pacelli pontificate. In China and [[North Korea]] Catholic religious no longer existed. Foreign missionaries were expelled, the fate of most local religious is unknown.<ref>Dammertz 379</ref>\n\n== Decrees of the Holy Office on Communism ==\n{{Main article|Decree against Communism}}\nThe Vatican, having been silent during the war on communist excesses, displayed a harder line on communism after 1945.\n\n== Encyclicals of Pope Pius XII on Church persecutions ==\nThe name of a Papal Encyclical is always taken from its [[incipit|first two or three words]].\n\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! rowspan=2| No.\n! colspan=2| Title\n! rowspan=2| Subject\n! rowspan=2| Date\n! rowspan=2| Text\n|-\n!

Church}}\nPersecutions against the [[Catholic Church]] took place throughout the pontificate of [[Pope Pius XII]] (1939-1958). Pius' reign coincided with the [[World War II|Second World War]], the commencement of the [[Cold War]] and the accelerating European [[Decolonization of Africa|decolonisation]]. During this time, the Catholic Church faced persecution under [[Fascism|Fascist]] and [[Communism|Communist]] governments.\n\nThe Nazi persecution of the church was at its most extreme in [[German-occupied Poland|Occupied Poland]]. The defeat of Fascism at the end of [[World War Two|World War II]] ended one set of persecutions, but strengthened the position of Communism throughout the world, intensifying a further set of persecutions \u2013 notably in [[Eastern Europe]], the [[USSR]], and, later, the [[People's Republic of China]]. The Catholic Church was under attack in all [[Communist]] governed countries and lost most of its existence in [[Albania]], [[Bulgaria]], [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia]], [[Romania]], Communist China and the Soviet Union (including [[Estonia]], [[Latvia]] and [[Lithuania]]).\n\n== Summary ==\nThe pontificate of Pius XII coincided with the Second World War (1939-1945) and the early stages of the Cold War. The Catholic Church was repressed under the Nazi Empire and then under the Soviet dominated Communist states established in Eastern and Central Europe following the war. The Catholic Church in Germany was systematically repressed by the Nazis and persecution was at its most severe in Nazi occupied Poland, where churches, seminaries, monasteries and convents were systematically closed and thousands of priests and nuns were either murdered, imprisoned or deported.\n\nAccording to [[John Cornwell (writer)|John Cornwell]], the Church was faced with a dilemma: compromise with the governments in order to maintain a structure with which to survive, or resist or confront and risk annihilation.<ref name=\"Cornwell 333\">Cornwell 333</ref> To save its faithful, the Vatican attempted both at varying times.\n\nIn [[East Germany]] and [[Hungary]], the Church was subjected to ongoing attacks, but was able to continue some of its activities, however on a much reduced scale. In [[Albania]], [[Bulgaria]], [[Czechoslovakia]] and [[Hungary]], persecution continued to the point that the Church faced extinction. In the Soviet Union and mainland China, the Catholic Church largely ceased to exist, at least publicly, during the [[pontificate]] of Pope Pius XII.\n\n==Fascist persecutions==\n===Nazi persecutions===\n\n====Germany====\n\nThe Catholic Church had been a leading opponent of the rise of the [[National Socialist German Workers Party]] through the 1920s and early 1930s. Upon taking power in 1933, and despite the [[Reichskonkordat|Concordat]] it signed with the church promising the contrary, the Nazi Government of [[Adolf Hitler]] began suppressing the Catholic Church as part of an overall policy of to eliminate competing sources of authority. The Nazis arrested thousands of members of the German [[Centre Party (Germany)|Catholic Centre Party]] as well as Catholic clergymen and closed Catholic schools and institutions. As the [[Third Reich]] expanded, thousands more Catholic priests were imprisoned or killed and Catholic institutions disbanded by the Nazis.<ref>http://www.yadvashem.org/yv/en/holocaust/about/01/non_jews_persecution.asp</ref>\n\nAccording to Hitler's biographer [[Alan Bullock]], Hitler was a \"man who believed neither in God nor in conscience ('a Jewish invention, a blemish like circumcision')\".<ref>[[Alan Bullock]]; ''Hitler, a Study in Tyranny''; HarperPerennial Edition 1991; p216</ref> Bullock wrote: Hitler thought that Catholic teachings, taken to their conclusion, \"would mean the systematic cultivation of the human failure\".<ref>[[Alan Bullock]]; ''Hitler, a Study in Tyranny''; HarperPerennial Edition 1991; p218</ref> Bullock adds that \"once the war was over, [Hitler] promised himself, he would root out and destroy the influence of the Christian churches, but until then he would be circumspect\":<ref>[[Alan Bullock]]; ''Hitler, a Study in Tyranny''; HarperPerennial Edition 1991; p219</ref>\n\n{{quote|Hitler had been brought up a Catholic and was impressed by the organisation and power of the Church.

Smuggled into Germany to avoid prior censorship and read from the pulpits of all German Catholic churches, it condemned Nazi ideology<ref>Frattini, p. 230</ref> as \"insane and arrogant\".

The Nazis retaliated with a series of repressive measures.<ref>http://www.yadvashem.org/odot_pdf/Microsoft%20Word%20-%20684.pdf</ref> Many Catholics were involved in strikes and protests against the treatment of Jews, and the Nazis offered to exempt converts and Jews married to non-Jews if protests ceased. The [[Old Catholic Church of the Netherlands#Old Catholic Archbishops of Utrecht|Archbishop of Utrecht]] and other Catholics refused to comply, and the Nazis commenced a round up of all ethnically Jewish Catholics.

As previously with Germany under the National Socialist government, Pope Pius refused to break diplomatic relations with Communist authorities.<ref>Before 1939, as Secretary of State, he had debated this point with [[Pope Pius XI]]. Pacelli argued, that a break of diplomatic relations means losing all contacts with the local hierarchy and, eventually, paying a much higher price:\n\n* Pius XI asked me, how can the [[Holy See]]  keep its [[nuncio]] there?  This is against our honour. I answered: Your Holiness,  what do we do afterwards? How do we maintain any contacts with our bishops?  He understood and calmed down. (Actes et documents Vol II, p.424)</ref>\n\nThus, after World War II, the [[Holy See|Vatican]] kept its nuncios in Poland, Hungary, Yugoslavia, Czechoslovakia, [[Romania]] and China, until these countries severed relations, interrupting communication with bishops as well. The Vatican responded, by giving local bishops unprecedented authority to deal with authorities on their own, but without granting the right to define overall relations, viewed as the sole privilege of the Holy See.<ref>Letter of Monsignor Tardini to the Archbishop of Belgrad, 2 16, 1952, in HK VII, 1952 447</ref> In encyclicals such as ''[[Invicti athletae]]'', and Apostolic letters to Czech Bishops, Polish Bishops, the Bishops of Hungary, China, and Romania,<ref>Czechoslovakia AAS 1948 33, Poland AAS 1949 29,    Hungary AAS 1952 249, China AAS 1952 153, Romania AAS 1947, 223</ref> the Pope encouraged local bishops to be firm, modest and wise in their dealings with the new communist authorities.

Nevertheless, the Vatican was not successful in blocking episcopal enthronements by the governments of China and Czechoslovakia. These persons were not excommunicated, however. In his last encyclical [[Ad Apostolorum Principis]] to the bishops of China, Pope Pius XII expressed the opinion, that schismatic bishops and priests are the final step towards total elimination of the Catholic Church in that country.<ref>AAS 1958 601</ref> Questions were raised as to why the Vatican appointed powerful but often inexperienced American bishops as nuncios in some Eastern countries, given the anti-American, anti-imperialist tendencies in these countries.<ref>see Stehle, Ostpolitik</ref> While there is no documentation on Vatican motives, a possible reason could be the relative security of US nationals in foreign countries.\n\n=== Persecutions and Church policies ===\n==== China ====\n[[File:Sacr\u00e9-C\u0153ur de Shizhi.jpg|thumb|left|[[Sacred Heart Cathedral of Guangzhou]]]]\n{{Main article|Pope Pius XII and China}}\n\nFor centuries, access to the people of China was difficult for the Catholic Church, because it did not recognize local [[Confucian]] customs of honouring deceased family members. To the Chinese, this was an [[ancient]] [[ritual]], to the Vatican, it was a [[religious]] exercise which conflicted with [[Roman Catholic Church|Catholic]] [[dogma]]. As a result, the Church made little progress in China. Within month of his election, Pope Pius issued a dramatic change in policies. On 8 December 1939 the Sacred Congregation of the Propagation of Faith issued, at the request of Pius XII, a new instruction, by which Chinese customs were no longer considered [[superstitious]], but an honourable way of esteeming ones relatives and therefore permitted by Catholic Christians.<ref>Smit 186\u2013187.</ref> The [[Government of the Republic of China|Government of China]] established diplomatic relations with the Vatican in 1943, within a short interval.

This was less than one percent of the population but numbers increased dramatically. In 1949, there existed 20 archdioceses, 85 dioceses, 39 apostolic prefectures, 3080 foreign missionaries, 2557 Chinese priests.<ref>Giovanetti 230</ref>\n\nThe establishment of the [[People's Republic of China]] in 1949 put these early advances on hold and led to the [[persecution]] of thousands of clergy and faithful in China. A patriotic Chinese Church was formed. Since that time, the persecuted Catholic Church exists as a tiny fraction in secrecy and underground only. The losses were considerable. For example, in 1948, the Catholic Church operated some 254 orphanages and 196 hospitals with 81628 beds.<ref>Herder Korrespondenz 5, 201</ref> Catholic clergy experienced increased supervision. Bishops and priests were forced to engage in degrading menial jobs to earn their living.

At once, the United Catholic Churches of [[Armenia]], [[Ukraine]] and [[Ruthenia]] were attacked.\n\n==== Catholic Ruthenian and Ukrainian Churches ====\nSoviet attempts to separate the United Churches from Rome reflected not only Soviet policy, but were a continuation of centuries-old Russian policies towards the Papacy, already viewed as [[anti-Russian]].<ref>see main article, Pope Pius IX, Pope Leo XIII</ref> He{{Clarify|date=May 2019}} also was aware that, in months preceding the [[encyclical]] ''[[Orientales omnes Ecclesias]]'', all Catholic bishops of the Ukrainian Church had been arrested.

The remaining leaders of the hierarchies and heads of all seminaries and Episcopal offices were arrested and tried in 1945 and 1946.\n\nAfter the Church was thus robbed of all its leadership, a \"spontaneous movement\" for separation from Rome and unification with the Russian Orthodox Church developed. [[Mass arrest]]s of priests followed. In [[Lemko]], some five hundred priests were jailed in 1945<ref>Giovannetti, 90</ref> or sent to a Gulag, officially called, \"an unknown destination because of political reasons\".<ref>Smit, 174</ref> Church institutions were confiscated and expropriated; churches, monasteries and seminaries closed and looted,<ref>Adrianyi, 517</ref> Catholic United Churches were integrated under the [[Moscow Patriarchy]] after all residing bishops and apostolic administrators were arrested.<ref>Adrianyi, 518</ref> The Catholic Church of the Ukraine was thus liquidated and its properties turned over to the Orthodox Church under the [[Patriarch of Moscow]].\n\nAfter Joseph Stalin died in 1953, \"[[peaceful coexistence]]\" became subject of numerous discussions. In his Christmas Message of 1954, Pius XII defined possibilities and preconditions for peaceful coexistence. He indicated Vatican willingness to practical [[cooperation]] whenever possible in the interest of the faithful. The slow pace of de[[-Stalinisation]] and the Soviet crack-down of the [[Hungarian Revolution of 1956|Hungarian Revolution]] did not produce major results, aside from modest improvements in Poland and Yugoslavia after 1956. In January 1958, Soviet Foreign Minister [[Andrey Gromyko]] expressed willingness of Moscow to have formal relations with the Vatican, in light of the position of Pope Pius XII on world peace and the uses of atomic energy for peaceful purposes, a position which he claimed{{Clarify|post-text=(who claimed?)|date=May 2019}} was identical with [[Kremlin]] policy.<ref>Giovannetti,  88</ref>\n\n==== Lithuania, Estonia and Latvia ====\nThe small Catholic Churches of Estonia and the Church in Latvia were completely annihilated after the Soviet Union reintegrated these countries into its territory in 1945.

By late 1947, Catholic educational institutes, kindergartens, schools, orphanages were expropriated as well. Starting in 1948, mass arrest and show trials began to take place against Catholic bishops and clergy.\nPope Pius XII responded with an apostolic letter ''Flagranti Semper Animi'',<ref>January 18, 1948, AAS 1948, 324</ref> in which he defended the Church against attacks and Stalinist persecution tactics. However, pressures against the Church increased with the de facto outlawing of religious meetings and organizations. Pope Pius responded with a letter commemorating the 10th anniversary of the beginning of World War II, [[Decennium Dum Expletur]]. He writes, that while the Polish people had suffered like nobody else during the war, ten years afterwards, the suffering continues. [[Cum Jam Lustri]] commemorates the death of two Polish Cardinals, Hlond and Sapieha and gives courage to the Church in Poland. In honour of [[Stanislaus of Szczepan\u00f3w|Saint Stanis\u0142aw]], Pope Pius XII issues [[Poloniae Annalibus]], giving consolation and again expressing his certain conviction, that Christ will win and the persecution will end.

Because of rival interpretations the concordat was enacted ten years later in 1940. In 1948, the Communist government withdrew from the concordat and closed most Catholic institutes. Only two small dioceses were permitted to continue, the others were considered non-existent.<ref>Adrianyi,531</ref> The six united bishops and several Latin rite bishops were jailed to long sentences. All schools were closed, Catholic activities were outlawed.<ref>Adrianyi,532.</ref><ref>''[[Orientales Ecclesias]]'', Acta Apostolicae Sedis (AAS), Roma, Vaticano, 1953, 5.</ref>\n\nBulgaria became a [[People's Republic]] on 15 October 1946. The new [[constitution]] of 1947 limited religious activities. Massive Church persecution followed. The Church lost all its bishops, organizations, religious institutes. Most of the priests and religious perished within five years,<ref>Adrianyi, 536</ref> many of them in Siberia.\n\nIn Albania, the Communist government assumed the role of liberator, since the country was under [[Italy|Italian]] [[Military occupation|occupation]] since 1939. The Catholic Church was denounced as the Church of the [[oppression|oppressor]]s. All foreign priests and religious were expelled. Domestic bishops, priests and religious were killed, jailed or sent to unknown destinations. As in other countries, a peace-loving national Church was attempted as well. The government prided itself on having eradicated religion and closed every Catholic Church.<ref>Adrianyi,536</ref>\n\n==== Yugoslavia ====\nAfter defining relations with the [[Orthodox Church]] in 1929,  [[Muslim]]s in 1931, [[Protestant]]s and [[Jew]]s in 1933, a [[Concordat]] was signed in 1935 between Yugoslavia and the Vatican. After the Orthodox Church excommunicated all politicians involved in its parliamentary passing, the government withdrew the text from final vote in the upper house. De Facto however, the spirit of the concordat was accepted and the Church began to flourish in the years prior to World War II.<ref>Adrianyi,533</ref> The war was difficult for the Church, as the country was largely occupied by Italian and German forces. The [[Independent State of Croatia]], which declared independence from the [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia]], was open to the needs of the Church, which led to open [[collaboration]] of several Church officials with Croatian government policies.\n\nAfter the war, the systematic persecution of the Church began as it did in all the other socialist countries. Some 1300 of the clergy was assassinated among them 139 Franciscan friar, 50% of the clergy was jailed.<ref>Adrianyi,534</ref> As in Czechoslovakia and other countries, Belgrade created government-controlled organizations of priests, in an attempt to divide the clergy. A major bone of contention was [[Aloysius Stepinac]], who was elevated to the College of Cardinals in 1953. To President Tito \"a provocation\", this represented to Pope Pius \"a just recognition of his extraordinary merits and a symbol of our affection and encouragement for our beloved sons and daughters, who testify their faith with steadfastness and courage in very difficult times. The Pope explained that he did not intend to insult the Yugoslavian authorities, but neither did he agree with any of the unjust accusations which resulted in the punishment of the Archbishop.<ref>Pio XII Discorsi, 1952, January 12, 1953</ref> Stepinac was not permitted to receive the red hat in Rome, and remained under house arrest (unable to participate in the 1958 conclave) until his death in 1960. [[Pope John Paul II]] beatified him. After his death, relations to the Vatican improved significantly. In 1974, the Church in Yugoslavia counted 15500 priests, religious and nuns<ref>HK 1977,318\u2013324</ref>\n\n=== Persecution of religious institutes ===\n[[Religious institute]]s and institutions are historically visible targets in time of conflict and strife. Their houses, convents or monasteries were looted, burned or destroyed throughout Europe for centuries in virtually all European countries. The beginning of the pontificate of Pius XII coincided with the end of the Civil War in Spain, in which, in addition to thousands of faithful, some 4184 secular priests, 2365 religious and 283 female religious were killed within a three-year period.<ref>Dammertz 375</ref>\n\nIn World War II, the [[religious (Catholicism)|religious]] of Poland suffered from an exceptionally brutal German occupation. A 1940 thirteen-point program provided that \"all religious institutes, convents and monasteries will be closed because they do not reflect German morality and population policy.\"<ref>Dammertz 376</ref> The German policy, to treat Poles as subhuman \"Untermenschen\", was especially brutal against representatives of religious orders. [[Gestapo]] raids let to the murdering, assassination and deportation to concentration camps of numerous religious, including the Franciscan friar [[Maximilian Kolbe]].\n[[File:Chapel of Saint Kazimieras with his sarcophagus in Vilnius Cathedral.jpg|thumb|left|Chapel of [[Saint Casimir]] with his coffin in Vilnius, Lithuania]]\nIn the [[Dachau concentration camp]] alone, some 2800 Polish priests and religious were incarcerated, of whom approximately 1000 were killed or died of hunger.

Especially brutal was Holy Week in 1942. One thousand and eight hundred Polish priests and religious went through punishment drills and exercises uninterrupted from morning to night every day.<ref name=\"HK 1960, 27\"/> Pope Pius XII informed the cardinals in 1945 that among all the horrors, which priests and religious had to endure in concentration camps, the fate of Polish inmates was by far the worst.<ref>Pio XII, Discorsi VII, 1945,  Roma, Vaticano, 74</ref>\n\nAfter 1945, Poland was resurrected, but the Polish government continued the attacks against the Catholic Church. All religious were forced to leave hospitals and educational institutions, their properties were confiscated. Within seven years, fifty-four religious were killed. One hundred and seventy priests were deported to gulags.<ref>Dammertz 378</ref> However, after a change of government in 1956, the condition of the Church improved. Harassment and persecution of the Church continued but religious vocations were permitted and Poland became the only Eastern country which contributed in great numbers religious missionaries to worldwide service.<ref>Dammertz 379</ref>\n\nIn all East European countries, after World War II, persecution of religious assumed new dimensions. All religious houses in the Ukraine were confiscated and their inhabitants either jailed or sent home. All religious houses were confiscated and closed in Lithuania as well. In Albania, all religious orders were forcibly closed. In Bulgaria and Czechoslovakia, all monasteries and religious institutes were erased after 1950.<ref>Dammertz 377</ref> In Hungary, 10,000 members of religious orders were ordered to leave their residences within three months. Some 300 were permitted to remain.<ref>Dammertz 378</ref> The Hungarian hierarchy entered an agreement with the authorities, which permitted the reopening of eight Catholic schools<ref>Galter, 345\u2013353,</ref><ref>Herder Korrespondenz, 5, 1950, 33</ref>\n\nIn [[SFRY|Yugoslavia]], all orders were closed after the war and properties confiscated. In [[Bosnia (region)|Bosnia]], numerous religious figures were killed, among them 139 Franciscan priests. However, as Yugoslavia distanced itself increasingly from Moscow, significant improvements were noticed in [[Slovenia]] and [[Croatia]] during the last two years of the Pacelli pontificate. In China and [[North Korea]] Catholic religious no longer existed. Foreign missionaries were expelled, the fate of most local religious is unknown.<ref>Dammertz 379</ref>\n\n== Decrees of the Holy Office on Communism ==\n{{Main article|Decree against Communism}}\nThe Vatican, having been silent during the war on communist excesses, displayed a harder line on communism after 1945.\n\n== Encyclicals of Pope Pius XII on Church persecutions ==\nThe name of a Papal Encyclical is always taken from its [[incipit|first two or three words]].\n\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! rowspan=2| No.\n! colspan=2| Title\n! rowspan=2| Subject\n! rowspan=2| Date\n! rowspan=2| Text\n|-\n!

Early regional prototypes included ''East Bay Today'', an [[Oakland, California]]-based publication published in the late 1970s to serve as the morning edition of the ''[[Oakland Tribune]]'', an afternoon newspaper which Gannett owned at the time.<ref>{{cite news | url=https://www.chicagotribune.com/news/ct-xpm-1991-09-29-9103140104-story.html | title=PAPER PURSUES LIFE AFTER DEBT | first=James | last=Warren | work=[[Chicago Tribune]] | date=September 29, 1991| url-access=subscription}}</ref> On June 11, 1981, Gannett printed the first prototypes of the proposed publication.

At launch, Neuharth was appointed president and publisher of the newspaper, adding those responsibilities to his existing position as Gannett's [[chief executive officer]].<ref name=timeline/><ref name=\"marking30\">{{cite web|title=USA Today Is Turning 30, in Danger of 'Marking 30'|url=http://www.editorandpublisher.com/columns/usa-today-is-turning-30-in-danger-of-marking-30/ |author=John K. Hartman|website=[[Editor and Publisher]]|date=September 12, 2012}}</ref>\n\nGannett announced the launch of the paper on April 20, 1982. ''USA Today'' began publishing on September 15, 1982, initially in the [[Baltimore]] and [[Washington, D.C.]] metropolitan areas for an newsstand price of 25\u00a2 (equivalent to {{Inflation|US|25|1982|fmt=c}}\u00a2 today). After selling out the first issue, Gannett gradually expanded the national distribution of the paper, reaching an estimated circulation of 362,879 copies by the end of 1982, double the amount of sales that Gannett projected. The design uniquely incorporated color graphics and photographs. Initially, only its front news section pages were rendered in four-color, while the remaining pages were printed in a [[spot color]] format. The paper's overall style and elevated use of graphics \u2013 developed by Neuharth, in collaboration with staff graphics designers George Rorick, Sam Ward, Suzy Parker, John Sherlock and Web Bryant \u2013 was derided by critics, who referred to it as \"[[McDonald's|McPaper]]\" or \"television you can wrap fish in,\" because it opted to incorporate concise nuggets of information more akin to the style of [[television news]], rather than in-depth stories like traditional newspapers, which many in the newspaper industry considered to be a [[dumbing down]] of the news.<ref name=timeline/><ref name=\"marking30\"/><ref name=\"garcia-usatoday2\">{{cite web|title=USA TODAY turns 30-Part 2\u2014-A newspaper that influenced all of us|url=http://www.garciamedia.com/blog/usa_today_turns_30-part_2---a_newspaper_that_influenced_all_of_us|author=Mario R.

''USA Today'' operated at a loss for most of its first four years of operation, accumulating a total deficit of $233&nbsp;million after taxes, according to figures released by Gannett in July 1987; the newspaper began turning its first profit in May 1987, six months ahead of Gannett corporate revenue projections.<ref name=timeline/>\n\nOn January 29, 1988, ''USA Today'' published the largest edition in its history, a 78-page weekend edition featuring a section previewing [[Super Bowl XXII]]; the edition included 44.38 pages of advertising and sold 2,114,055 copies, setting a single-day record for an American newspaper (and surpassed seven months later on September 2, when its [[Labor Day]] weekend edition sold 2,257,734 copies). On April 15, ''USA Today'' launched a third international printing site, based in [[Hong Kong]]. The international edition set circulation and advertising records during August 1988, with coverage of the [[1988 Summer Olympics]], selling more than 60,000 copies and 100 pages of advertising.<ref name=timeline/>\n\nBy July 1991, Simmons Market Research Bureau estimated that ''USA Today'' had a total daily readership of nearly 6.6&nbsp;million, an all-time high and the largest readership of any daily newspaper in the United States.

On September 12 of that year, the newspaper set an all-time single day circulation record, selling 3,638,600 copies for its edition covering the [[September 11 attacks]].

The site was designed to be more interactive, provide optimizations for [[mobile device|mobile]] and [[touchscreen]] devices, provide \"high impact\" advertising units, and provide the ability for Gannett to syndicate USA Today content to the websites of its local properties, and vice versa. To accomplish this goal, Gannett migrated its newspaper and television station websites to the Presto platform and the USA Today site design throughout 2013 and 2014 (although archive content accessible through [[search engines]] remains available through the pre-relaunch design).<ref name=poynter-gannettpresto>{{cite news| title=Case Study: Gannett's monumental task \u2013 A content management system for all |url=https://www.poynter.org/reporting-editing/2014/case-study-gannetts-monumental-task-a-content-management-system-for-all/ | publisher=[[Poynter Institute]] | date=July 7, 2014}}</ref><ref name=\"garcia-usatoday6\">{{cite web | title=It's a new website rethink for USA TODAY, too | url=http://www.garciamedia.com/blog/its_a_new_website_rethink_for_usa_today_too/ | first=Mario R. | last=Garc\u00eda | website=Garc\u00eda Media | date=September 17, 2012}}</ref>\n\n===Mid-2010s expansion and restructuring===\nOn October 6, 2013, Gannett test launched a condensed daily edition of ''USA Today'' (part of what was internally known within Gannett as the \"Butterfly\" initiative) for distribution as an insert in four of its newspapers \u2013 ''[[The Indianapolis Star]]'', the ''[[Rochester Democrat & Chronicle]]'', the [[Fort Myers, Florida|Fort Myers]]-based ''[[The News-Press]]'' and the [[Appleton, Wisconsin]]-based ''[[The Post-Crescent]]''. The launch of the syndicated insert caused ''USA Today'' to restructure its operations to allow seven-day-a-week production to accommodate the packaging of its national and international news content and enterprise stories (comprising about 10 pages for the weekday and Saturday editions, and up to 22 pages for the Sunday edition) into the pilot insert. Gannett later announced on December 11, that it would formally launch the condensed daily edition of ''USA Today'' in 31 additional local newspapers nationwide through April 2014 (with the [[Palm Springs, California]]-based ''[[The Desert Sun]]'' and the [[Lafayette, Louisiana]]-based ''Advertiser'' being the first newspapers outside of the pilot program participants to add the supplement on December 15), citing \"positive feedback\" to the feature from readers and advertisers of the initial four papers.

The ''[[Louisville Courier-Journal]]'' had earlier soft-launched the service as part of a pilot program started on November 17, coinciding with an imaging rebrand for the [[Louisville, Kentucky]]-based newspaper; Gannett's other local newspaper properties, as well as those it acquired through its merger with the [[Journal Media Group]], gradually began identifying themselves as part of the USA Today Network (foregoing use of the Gannett name outside of requisite ownership references) through early January 2016.<ref>{{cite press release | title=Gannett Unites Largest Local to National Media Network under 'USA TODAY NETWORK' | url=https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20151203005219/en/Gannett-Unites-Largest-Local-National-Media-Network | publisher=[[Business Wire]] | date=December 3, 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite news | title=Gannett introduces USA TODAY NETWORK, uniting local, national properties | url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/2015/12/03/gannett-introduces-usa-today-network-uniting-local-national-properties/76716562/| first=Roger | last=Yu | newspaper=USA Today | publisher=[[Gannett]] | date=December 4, 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite news | title=Gannett rebrands its local papers as USA TODAY Network | url=https://www.poynter.org/reporting-editing/2015/gannett-rebrands-its-local-papers-as-usa-today-network/ | first=Rick | last=Edmonds | work=[[Poynter Institute]] | date=December 3, 2015}}</ref>\n\n==Layout and format==\n[[File:USA Today cover page.jpg|thumb|This February 5, 2009 issue of ''USA Today'' shows the old layout and logo of the paper prior to its 2012 redesign.]]\n''USA Today'' is known for synthesizing news down to easy-to-read-and-comprehend stories. In the main edition circulated in the United States and [[Canada]], each edition consists of four sections: News (the oft-labeled \"front page\" section), Money, Sports, and Life. Since March 1998, the Friday edition of Life has been separated into two distinct sections: the regular Life focusing on entertainment (subtitled ''Weekend''; section E), which features television reviews and listings, a DVD column, [[Film criticism|film reviews]] and trends, and a travel supplement called ''Destinations & Diversions'' (section D). The international edition of the paper features two sections: News and Money in one; with Sports and Life in the other.\n\nAtypical of most daily newspapers, the paper does not print on Saturdays and Sundays; the Friday edition serves as the weekend edition (although ''USA Today'' has published special Saturday and Sunday editions in the past, the first being published on January 19, 1991, when it released a Saturday \"Extra\" edition updating coverage of the [[Gulf War]] from the previous day; the paper published special seven-day-a-week editions for the first time on July 19, 1996, when it published special editions for exclusive distribution in the host city of [[Atlanta]] and surrounding areas for the two-week duration of the [[1996 Summer Olympics]]).<ref name=timeline/> ''USA Today'' prints each complete story on the front page of the respective section with the exception of the cover story. The cover story is a longer story that requires a jump (readers must turn to another page in the paper to complete the story, usually the next page of that section). On certain days, the news or sports section will take up two paper sections, and there will be a second cover story within the second section.\n\nEach section is denoted by a certain color to differentiate sections beyond lettering and is seen in a box the top-left corner of the first page; the principal section colors are blue for News (section A), green for Money (section B), red for Sports (section C), and purple for Life (section D); in the paper's early years, the Life and Money sections were also assigned blue nameplates and spot color, as the presses used at ''USA Today''{{'}} printing facilities did not yet accommodate the use of other colors to denote all four original sections.<ref name=\"garcia-usatoday4\">{{cite web|title=USA TODAY turns 30-Part 4-The first newspaper to do that tango of the serious and the silly|url=http://www.garciamedia.com/blog/usa_today_turns_30-part_4-the_first_newspaper_to_do_that_tango_of_the_serio|author=Mario R.

To increase their ties to ''USA Today'', Gannett incorporated the ''USA Today'' coloring scheme into an internally created graphics package for news programming that the company began phasing in across its television station group \u2013 which were spun-off in July 2015 into the separate broadcast and digital media company [[Tegna, Inc.|Tegna]] \u2013 in late 2012 (the package utilizes the color scheme for a rundown graphic used on most stations \u2013 outside those that Gannett acquired in 2014 from London Broadcasting, which began implementing the package in late 2015 \u2013 that persists throughout its stations' newscasts, as well as bumpers for individual story topics). Gannett's television stations began to a new on-air appearance that uses a color-coding system identical to that of the paper.<ref name=tvnc-newgraphics>{{cite news | title=Gannett Stations Clean Up Their Graphics| url=https://tvnewscheck.com/article/64783/gannett-stations-clean-up-their-graphics/ | first=Diana | last=Marszalek | website=TVNewsCheck | date=January 15, 2013}}</ref>\n\n[[File:USA Today Logo.svg|upright=0.8|thumb|left|Original logo, used from 1982 to 2012.]]\nIn many ways, ''USA Today'' is set up to break the typical newspaper layout. Some examples of that divergence from tradition include using the left-hand quarter of each section as reefers (front-page paragraphs referring to stories on inside pages<ref>{{cite web |title=Reefer, noun 3 |url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/reefer|website=Dictionary.com}}</ref>), sometimes using sentence-length blurbs to describe stories inside; the lead reefer is the cover page feature \"Newsline,\" which shows summarized descriptions of headline stories featured in all four main sections and any special sections. As a national newspaper, ''USA Today'' cannot focus on the weather for any one city. Therefore, the entire back page of the News section is used for weather maps for the [[continental United States]], [[Puerto Rico]] and the [[United States Virgin Islands]], and temperature lists for many cities throughout the U.S. and the world (temperatures for individual cities on the primary forecast map and temperature lists are suffixed with a one- or two-letter code, such as \"t\" for [[thunderstorm]]s, referencing the expected weather conditions); the colorized forecast map, originally created by staff designer George Rorick (who left ''USA Today'' for a similar position at ''[[The Detroit News]]'' in 1986), was copied by newspapers around the world, breaking from the traditional style of using monochrome contouring or simplistic text to denote temperature ranges.<ref name=\"garcia-usatoday2\"/><ref name=\"garcia-usatoday3\">{{cite web|title=USA TODAY turns 30-Part 3\u2014A weather map that created a global tsunami|url=http://www.garciamedia.com/blog/usa_today_turns_30-part_3--a_weather_map_that_created_a_global_tsunami | author=Mario R.

Weather data is provided by [[AccuWeather]], which has served as the forecast provider for ''USA Today'' for most of the paper's existence (with an exception from January 2002 to September 2012, when [[The Weather Channel]] provided data through a long-term multimedia content agreement with Gannett).<ref>{{cite press release |title=AccuWeather Announces New Partnership With USA Today |url=http://www.accuweather.com/en/weather-news/usa-today-accuweather-partnership/73810|website=[[AccuWeather]]|publisher=AccuWeather, Inc. | date=September 17, 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite press release | title=AccuWeather Chosen by USA TODAY to Help Deliver the News of the Future | url=https://www.accuweather.com/en/press/73792 | publisher=[[AccuWeather]] | date=September 14, 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite press release |title=The Weather Channel is Named Premier Weather Provider for USA TODAY | url=https://www.bloomberg.com/press-releases/2002-01-14/the-weather-channel-is-named-premier-weather-provider-for-usa-ii7ptfu8 | publisher=[[Business Wire]] | via=[[Bloomberg News]] | date=January 14, 2002}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |title=AccuWeather celebrates 50-year anniversary| url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/capital-weather-gang/post/accuweather-celebrates-50-year-anniversary/2012/11/15/8c03d930-2f49-11e2-9f50-0308e1e75445_blog.html | first=Jason | last=Samenow| work=[[The Washington Post]] | date=November 15, 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite news | url=http://www.statecollege.com/news/local-news/accuweather-commemorates-50-years-with-yearlong-celebration,1183951/ | title=AccuWeather Commemorates 50 Years With Year-Long Celebration | first=Laura | last=Nichols | website=The State College | date=November 19, 2012 }}</ref> In the bottom left-hand corner of the weather page is \"Weather Focus\", a graphic which explains various meteorological phenomena. On some days, the Weather Focus could be a photo of a rare meteorological event.\n\nOn Mondays, the Money section uses its back page for \"Market Trends,\" a feature that launched in June 2002 and presents an unusual graphic depicting the performance of various industry groups as a function of quarterly, monthly, and weekly movements against the [[S&P 500]]. On days featuring bonus sections or business holidays, the Money and Life sections are usually combined into one section, while combinations of the Friday Life editions into one section are common during quiet weeks. Advertising coverage is seen in the Monday Money section, which often includes a review of a current television ad, and after [[Super Bowl Sunday]], a review of the ads aired during the broadcast with the results of the ''Ad Track'' live survey. Stock tables for individual stock exchanges (comprising one subsection for companies traded on the [[New York Stock Exchange]], and another for companies trading on [[NASDAQ]] and the [[American Stock Exchange]]) and mutual indexes were discontinued with the 2012 redesign due to the myriad of electronic ways to check individual stock prices, in line with most newspapers.\n\nBook coverage, including reviews and a national sales chart (the latter of which debuted on October 28, 1994), is seen on Thursdays in Life, with the official full [[A.C. Nielsen]] [[Nielsen ratings|television ratings]] chart printed on Wednesdays or Thursdays, depending on release. The paper also publishes the [[Mediabase]] survey for several genres of music, based on radio airplay spins on Tuesdays, along with their own chart of the top ten singles in general on Wednesdays. Because of the same limitations cited for its nationalized forecasts, the television page in Life \u2013 which provides [[prime time]] and [[late night television|late night]] listings (running from 8:00&nbsp;p.m. to 12:30&nbsp;a.m. [[Eastern Time Zone]]) \u2013 incorporates a boilerplate \"[[Local news]]\" or \"[[Local programming]]\" descriptions to denote time periods in which the five major English language broadcast networks ([[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]], [[NBC]], [[CBS]], [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] and [[The CW]]) cede airtime to allow their affiliates to carry [[broadcast syndication|syndicated programs]] or local newscasts; the television page has never been accompanied by a weekly listings supplement with broader scheduling information similar to those featured in local newspapers. Like most national papers, ''USA Today'' does not carry [[comic strip]]s.\n\n[[File:USA Today building.jpg|thumb|left|''USA Today'' is headquartered in [[Tysons Corner, Virginia]]<!-- Despite the McLean, VA address, the HQ is in Tysons Corner -->.]]\nOne of the staples of the News section is \"Across the USA,\" a state-by-state roundup of headlines. The summaries consist of paragraph-length [[Associated Press]] reports highlighting one story of note in each state, the [[District of Columbia]], and one U.S. territory. Similarly, the \"For the Record\" page of the Sports section (which features sports scores for both the previous four days of league play and individual non-league events, seasonal league statistics and wagering lines for the current day's games) also features a rundown of winning numbers from the previous deadline date for [[Lotteries in the United States|all participating state lotteries]] and individual multi-state lotteries.\n\nSome traditions have been retained. The [[news style|lead story]] still appears on the upper-right hand of the front page. Commentary and political cartoons occupy the last few pages of the News section. Stock and mutual fund data are presented in the Money section. But ''USA Today'' is sufficiently different in aesthetics to be recognized on sight, even in a mix of other newspapers, such as at a [[newsstand]]. The overall design and layout of ''USA Today'' has been described as neo-Victorian.<ref>{{cite web | title=After Modernism | url=http://formofnews.pbworks.com/w/page/13852307/Chapter%201%20%28part%205%29 | first=Kevin G. | last=Barnhurst | work=American Media in the XX Century: Chapter 1 (part 5) | publisher=University of Illinois at Chicago | year=2006 | quote=The m\u00e9lange of styles and practices in printed and now web-based newspapers, although postmodern in terms of scholarly and design thinking, might more meaningfully be understood as neo-Victorian. The new styles, embodied most famously in ''USA Today'' and its clones, mark a return to the mystifying abundance of facts and stories that newspapers of the industrial revolution made visually present to readers.}}</ref>\n\nAlso, in most of the sections' front pages, on the lower left hand corner, are \"USA Today Snapshots\", which give statistics of various lifestyle interests according to the section it is in (for example, a snapshot in \"Life\" could show how many people tend to watch a certain genre of television show based upon the type of mood they are in at the time). These \"Snapshots\" are shown through graphs which are made up of various illustrations of objects that roughly pertain to the graphs subject matter (using the example above, the graph's bars could be made up of several TV sets, or ended by one). These are usually loosely based on research by a national institute (with the credited source mentioned in fine print in the box below the graph).\n\nThe newspaper also features an occasional magazine supplement called ''Open Air'', which launched on March 7, 2008 and appears several times a year. Various other [[advertorial]]s appear throughout the year, mainly on Fridays.<ref>{{cite news | url=https://redesign.adweek.com/digital/usa-today-launches-open-air/ | title=USA Today Launches \"Open Air\" | work=[[AdWeek]] | date=December 10, 2007 | url-access=subscription}}</ref><ref>{{cite news | url=https://www.mediapost.com/publications/article/72444/gannett-to-launch-open-air-mslo-shutters-bluep.html | title=Gannett To Launch 'Open Air', MSLO Shutters 'Blueprint' | first=Erik | last=Sass | work=[[MediaPost]] | date=December 11, 2007}}</ref>\n\n===Opinion section===\nThe opinion section prints ''USA Today'' editorials, columns by guest writers and members of the Editorial Board of Contributors,<ref>{{cite news | title=USA Today's Opinion columnists | url=https://www.usatoday.com/news/opinion/USA-TODAY-board-of-contributors.htm | newspaper=USA Today | publisher=[[Gannett]] | date=August 29, 2011}}</ref> letters to the editor, and editorial cartoons.

It heavily criticized the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]] for both the [[2013 government shutdown]] and the 2015 revolts in the [[United States House of Representatives]] that ended with the resignation of [[John Boehner]] as House Speaker.

Early regional prototypes included ''East Bay Today'', an [[Oakland, California]]-based publication published in the late 1970s to serve as the morning edition of the ''[[Oakland Tribune]]'', an afternoon newspaper which Gannett owned at the time.<ref>{{cite news | url=https://www.chicagotribune.com/news/ct-xpm-1991-09-29-9103140104-story.html | title=PAPER PURSUES LIFE AFTER DEBT | first=James | last=Warren | work=[[Chicago Tribune]] | date=September 29, 1991| url-access=subscription}}</ref> On June 11, 1981, Gannett printed the first prototypes of the proposed publication.

''USA Today'' began publishing on September 15, 1982, initially in the [[Baltimore]] and [[Washington, D.C.]] metropolitan areas for an newsstand price of 25\u00a2 (equivalent to {{Inflation|US|25|1982|fmt=c}}\u00a2 today). After selling out the first issue, Gannett gradually expanded the national distribution of the paper, reaching an estimated circulation of 362,879 copies by the end of 1982, double the amount of sales that Gannett projected. The design uniquely incorporated color graphics and photographs. Initially, only its front news section pages were rendered in four-color, while the remaining pages were printed in a [[spot color]] format. The paper's overall style and elevated use of graphics \u2013 developed by Neuharth, in collaboration with staff graphics designers George Rorick, Sam Ward, Suzy Parker, John Sherlock and Web Bryant \u2013 was derided by critics, who referred to it as \"[[McDonald's|McPaper]]\" or \"television you can wrap fish in,\" because it opted to incorporate concise nuggets of information more akin to the style of [[television news]], rather than in-depth stories like traditional newspapers, which many in the newspaper industry considered to be a [[dumbing down]] of the news.<ref name=timeline/><ref name=\"marking30\"/><ref name=\"garcia-usatoday2\">{{cite web|title=USA TODAY turns 30-Part 2\u2014-A newspaper that influenced all of us|url=http://www.garciamedia.com/blog/usa_today_turns_30-part_2---a_newspaper_that_influenced_all_of_us|author=Mario R.

''USA Today'' operated at a loss for most of its first four years of operation, accumulating a total deficit of $233 million after taxes, according to figures released by Gannett in July 1987; the newspaper began turning its first profit in May 1987, six months ahead of Gannett corporate revenue projections.<ref name=timeline/>\n\nOn January 29, 1988, ''USA Today'' published the largest edition in its history, a 78-page weekend edition featuring a section previewing [[Super Bowl XXII]]; the edition included 44.38 pages of advertising and sold 2,114,055 copies, setting a single-day record for an American newspaper (and surpassed seven months later on September 2, when its [[Labor Day]] weekend edition sold 2,257,734 copies). On April 15, ''USA Today'' launched a third international printing site, based in [[Hong Kong]].

On September 12 of that year, the newspaper set an all-time single day circulation record, selling 3,638,600 copies for its edition covering the [[September 11 attacks]].

The launch of the syndicated insert caused ''USA Today'' to restructure its operations to allow seven-day-a-week production to accommodate the packaging of its national and international news content and enterprise stories (comprising about 10 pages for the weekday and Saturday editions, and up to 22 pages for the Sunday edition) into the pilot insert. Gannett later announced on December 11, that it would formally launch the condensed daily edition of ''USA Today'' in 31 additional local newspapers nationwide through April 2014 (with the [[Palm Springs, California]]-based ''[[The Desert Sun]]'' and the [[Lafayette, Louisiana]]-based ''Advertiser'' being the first newspapers outside of the pilot program participants to add the supplement on December 15), citing \"positive feedback\" to the feature from readers and advertisers of the initial four papers.

In the main edition circulated in the United States and [[Canada]], each edition consists of four sections: News (the oft-labeled \"front page\" section), Money, Sports, and Life. Since March 1998, the Friday edition of Life has been separated into two distinct sections: the regular Life focusing on entertainment (subtitled ''Weekend''; section E), which features television reviews and listings, a DVD column, [[Film criticism|film reviews]] and trends, and a travel supplement called ''Destinations & Diversions'' (section D). The international edition of the paper features two sections: News and Money in one; with Sports and Life in the other.\n\nAtypical of most daily newspapers, the paper does not print on Saturdays and Sundays; the Friday edition serves as the weekend edition (although ''USA Today'' has published special Saturday and Sunday editions in the past, the first being published on January 19, 1991, when it released a Saturday \"Extra\" edition updating coverage of the [[Gulf War]] from the previous day; the paper published special seven-day-a-week editions for the first time on July 19, 1996, when it published special editions for exclusive distribution in the host city of [[Atlanta]] and surrounding areas for the two-week duration of the [[1996 Summer Olympics]]).<ref name=timeline/> ''USA Today'' prints each complete story on the front page of the respective section with the exception of the cover story. The cover story is a longer story that requires a jump (readers must turn to another page in the paper to complete the story, usually the next page of that section). On certain days, the news or sports section will take up two paper sections, and there will be a second cover story within the second section.\n\nEach section is denoted by a certain color to differentiate sections beyond lettering and is seen in a box the top-left corner of the first page; the principal section colors are blue for News (section A), green for Money (section B), red for Sports (section C), and purple for Life (section D); in the paper's early years, the Life and Money sections were also assigned blue nameplates and spot color, as the presses used at ''USA Today''{{'}} printing facilities did not yet accommodate the use of other colors to denote all four original sections.<ref name=\"garcia-usatoday4\">{{cite web|title=USA TODAY turns 30-Part 4-The first newspaper to do that tango of the serious and the silly|url=http://www.garciamedia.com/blog/usa_today_turns_30-part_4-the_first_newspaper_to_do_that_tango_of_the_serio|author=Mario R.

To increase their ties to ''USA Today'', Gannett incorporated the ''USA Today'' coloring scheme into an internally created graphics package for news programming that the company began phasing in across its television station group \u2013 which were spun-off in July 2015 into the separate broadcast and digital media company [[Tegna, Inc.|Tegna]] \u2013 in late 2012 (the package utilizes the color scheme for a rundown graphic used on most stations \u2013 outside those that Gannett acquired in 2014 from London Broadcasting, which began implementing the package in late 2015 \u2013 that persists throughout its stations' newscasts, as well as bumpers for individual story topics). Gannett's television stations began to a new on-air appearance that uses a color-coding system identical to that of the paper.<ref name=tvnc-newgraphics>{{cite news | title=Gannett Stations Clean Up Their Graphics| url=https://tvnewscheck.com/article/64783/gannett-stations-clean-up-their-graphics/ | first=Diana | last=Marszalek | website=TVNewsCheck | date=January 15, 2013}}</ref>\n\n[[File:USA Today Logo.svg|upright=0.8|thumb|left|Original logo, used from 1982 to 2012.]]\nIn many ways, ''USA Today'' is set up to break the typical newspaper layout. Some examples of that divergence from tradition include using the left-hand quarter of each section as reefers (front-page paragraphs referring to stories on inside pages<ref>{{cite web |title=Reefer, noun 3 |url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/reefer|website=Dictionary.com}}</ref>), sometimes using sentence-length blurbs to describe stories inside; the lead reefer is the cover page feature \"Newsline,\" which shows summarized descriptions of headline stories featured in all four main sections and any special sections. As a national newspaper, ''USA Today'' cannot focus on the weather for any one city. Therefore, the entire back page of the News section is used for weather maps for the [[continental United States]], [[Puerto Rico]] and the [[United States Virgin Islands]], and temperature lists for many cities throughout the U.S. and the world (temperatures for individual cities on the primary forecast map and temperature lists are suffixed with a one- or two-letter code, such as \"t\" for [[thunderstorm]]s, referencing the expected weather conditions); the colorized forecast map, originally created by staff designer George Rorick (who left ''USA Today'' for a similar position at ''[[The Detroit News]]'' in 1986), was copied by newspapers around the world, breaking from the traditional style of using monochrome contouring or simplistic text to denote temperature ranges.<ref name=\"garcia-usatoday2\"/><ref name=\"garcia-usatoday3\">{{cite web|title=USA TODAY turns 30-Part 3\u2014A weather map that created a global tsunami|url=http://www.garciamedia.com/blog/usa_today_turns_30-part_3--a_weather_map_that_created_a_global_tsunami | author=Mario R.

Weather data is provided by [[AccuWeather]], which has served as the forecast provider for ''USA Today'' for most of the paper's existence (with an exception from January 2002 to September 2012, when [[The Weather Channel]] provided data through a long-term multimedia content agreement with Gannett).<ref>{{cite press release |title=AccuWeather Announces New Partnership With USA Today |url=http://www.accuweather.com/en/weather-news/usa-today-accuweather-partnership/73810|website=[[AccuWeather]]|publisher=AccuWeather, Inc. | date=September 17, 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite press release | title=AccuWeather Chosen by USA TODAY to Help Deliver the News of the Future | url=https://www.accuweather.com/en/press/73792 | publisher=[[AccuWeather]] | date=September 14, 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite press release |title=The Weather Channel is Named Premier Weather Provider for USA TODAY | url=https://www.bloomberg.com/press-releases/2002-01-14/the-weather-channel-is-named-premier-weather-provider-for-usa-ii7ptfu8 | publisher=[[Business Wire]] | via=[[Bloomberg News]] | date=January 14, 2002}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |title=AccuWeather celebrates 50-year anniversary| url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/capital-weather-gang/post/accuweather-celebrates-50-year-anniversary/2012/11/15/8c03d930-2f49-11e2-9f50-0308e1e75445_blog.html | first=Jason | last=Samenow| work=[[The Washington Post]] | date=November 15, 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite news | url=http://www.statecollege.com/news/local-news/accuweather-commemorates-50-years-with-yearlong-celebration,1183951/ | title=AccuWeather Commemorates 50 Years With Year-Long Celebration | first=Laura | last=Nichols | website=The State College | date=November 19, 2012 }}</ref> In the bottom left-hand corner of the weather page is \"Weather Focus\", a graphic which explains various meteorological phenomena. On some days, the Weather Focus could be a photo of a rare meteorological event.\n\nOn Mondays, the Money section uses its back page for \"Market Trends,\" a feature that launched in June 2002 and presents an unusual graphic depicting the performance of various industry groups as a function of quarterly, monthly, and weekly movements against the [[S&P 500]]. On days featuring bonus sections or business holidays, the Money and Life sections are usually combined into one section, while combinations of the Friday Life editions into one section are common during quiet weeks. Advertising coverage is seen in the Monday Money section, which often includes a review of a current television ad, and after [[Super Bowl Sunday]], a review of the ads aired during the broadcast with the results of the ''Ad Track'' live survey. Stock tables for individual stock exchanges (comprising one subsection for companies traded on the [[New York Stock Exchange]], and another for companies trading on [[NASDAQ]] and the [[American Stock Exchange]]) and mutual indexes were discontinued with the 2012 redesign due to the myriad of electronic ways to check individual stock prices, in line with most newspapers.\n\nBook coverage, including reviews and a national sales chart (the latter of which debuted on October 28, 1994), is seen on Thursdays in Life, with the official full [[A.C. Nielsen]] [[Nielsen ratings|television ratings]] chart printed on Wednesdays or Thursdays, depending on release. The paper also publishes the [[Mediabase]] survey for several genres of music, based on radio airplay spins on Tuesdays, along with their own chart of the top ten singles in general on Wednesdays. Because of the same limitations cited for its nationalized forecasts, the television page in Life \u2013 which provides [[prime time]] and [[late night television|late night]] listings (running from 8:00&nbsp;p.m. to 12:30&nbsp;a.m. [[Eastern Time Zone]]) \u2013 incorporates a boilerplate \"[[Local news]]\" or \"[[Local programming]]\" descriptions to denote time periods in which the five major English language broadcast networks ([[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]], [[NBC]], [[CBS]], [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] and [[The CW]]) cede airtime to allow their affiliates to carry [[broadcast syndication|syndicated programs]] or local newscasts; the television page has never been accompanied by a weekly listings supplement with broader scheduling information similar to those featured in local newspapers. Like most national papers, ''USA Today'' does not carry [[comic strip]]s.\n\n[[File:USA Today building.jpg|thumb|left|''USA Today'' is headquartered in [[Tysons Corner, Virginia]]<!-- Despite the McLean, VA address, the HQ is in Tysons Corner -->.]]\nOne of the staples of the News section is \"Across the USA,\" a state-by-state roundup of headlines. The summaries consist of paragraph-length [[Associated Press]] reports highlighting one story of note in each state, the [[District of Columbia]], and one U.S. territory. Similarly, the \"For the Record\" page of the Sports section (which features sports scores for both the previous four days of league play and individual non-league events, seasonal league statistics and wagering lines for the current day's games) also features a rundown of winning numbers from the previous deadline date for [[Lotteries in the United States|all participating state lotteries]] and individual multi-state lotteries.\n\nSome traditions have been retained. The [[news style|lead story]] still appears on the upper-right hand of the front page. Commentary and political cartoons occupy the last few pages of the News section. Stock and mutual fund data are presented in the Money section. But ''USA Today'' is sufficiently different in aesthetics to be recognized on sight, even in a mix of other newspapers, such as at a [[newsstand]]. The overall design and layout of ''USA Today'' has been described as neo-Victorian.<ref>{{cite web | title=After Modernism | url=http://formofnews.pbworks.com/w/page/13852307/Chapter%201%20%28part%205%29 | first=Kevin G. | last=Barnhurst | work=American Media in the XX Century: Chapter 1 (part 5) | publisher=University of Illinois at Chicago | year=2006 | quote=The m\u00e9lange of styles and practices in printed and now web-based newspapers, although postmodern in terms of scholarly and design thinking, might more meaningfully be understood as neo-Victorian. The new styles, embodied most famously in ''USA Today'' and its clones, mark a return to the mystifying abundance of facts and stories that newspapers of the industrial revolution made visually present to readers.}}</ref>\n\nAlso, in most of the sections' front pages, on the lower left hand corner, are \"USA Today Snapshots\", which give statistics of various lifestyle interests according to the section it is in (for example, a snapshot in \"Life\" could show how many people tend to watch a certain genre of television show based upon the type of mood they are in at the time). These \"Snapshots\" are shown through graphs which are made up of various illustrations of objects that roughly pertain to the graphs subject matter (using the example above, the graph's bars could be made up of several TV sets, or ended by one). These are usually loosely based on research by a national institute (with the credited source mentioned in fine print in the box below the graph).\n\nThe newspaper also features an occasional magazine supplement called ''Open Air'', which launched on March 7, 2008 and appears several times a year. Various other [[advertorial]]s appear throughout the year, mainly on Fridays.<ref>{{cite news | url=https://redesign.adweek.com/digital/usa-today-launches-open-air/ | title=USA Today Launches \u201cOpen Air\u201d | work=[[AdWeek]] | date=December 10, 2007 | url-access=subscription}}</ref><ref>{{cite news | url=https://www.mediapost.com/publications/article/72444/gannett-to-launch-open-air-mslo-shutters-bluep.html | title=Gannett To Launch 'Open Air', MSLO Shutters 'Blueprint' | first=Erik | last=Sass | work=[[MediaPost]] | date=December 11, 2007}}</ref>\n\n===Opinion section===\nThe opinion section prints ''USA Today'' editorials, columns by guest writers and members of the Editorial Board of Contributors,<ref>{{cite news | title=USA Today's Opinion columnists | url=https://www.usatoday.com/news/opinion/USA-TODAY-board-of-contributors.htm | newspaper=USA Today | publisher=[[Gannett]] | date=August 29, 2011}}</ref> letters to the editor, and editorial cartoons. One unique feature of the ''USA Today'' editorial page is the publication of opposing points of view; alongside the editorial board's piece on the day's topic runs an opposing view by a guest writer, often an expert in the field.

It heavily criticized the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]] for both the [[2013 government shutdown]] and the 2015 revolts in the [[United States House of Representatives]] that ended with the resignation of [[John Boehner]] as House Speaker. It also called out then-[[President of the United States|President]] [[Barack Obama]] and other top members of the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]] for what they perceived as \"inaction\" over several issues during 2013\u201314, particularly over the [[NSA]] scandal and the [[ISIL beheading incidents]].\n\nThe editorial board broke from the \"non-endorsement\" policy for the first time on September 29, 2016, when it published an op-ed piece condemning the candidacy of [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] nominee [[Donald Trump]], calling him \"unfit for the presidency\" due to his inflammatory campaign rhetoric (particularly that aimed at the press, with certain media organizations being openly targeted and even banned from campaign rallies, including ''[[The New York Times]]'', ''[[The Washington Post]]'', [[CNN]] and the [[BBC]], military veterans who had been prisoners of war, including 2008 Republican presidential candidate and Vietnam War veteran [[John McCain]], immigrants, and various ethnic and religious groups); his temperament and lack of financial transparency; his \"checkered\" business record; his use of false and hyperbolic statements; the inconsistency of his viewpoints and issues with his vision on domestic and foreign policy; and, based on comments he has made during his campaign and criticisms by both [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrats]] and Republicans on these views, the potential risks to national security and constitutional ethics under a Trump administration, asking voters to \"resist the siren song of a dangerous demagogue\".<ref>{{cite news | title=USA TODAY's Editorial Board: Trump is 'unfit for the presidency' | url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2016/09/29/dont-vote-for-donald-trump-editorial-board-editorials-debates/91295020/ | newspaper=USA Today | publisher=[[Gannett]] | date=September 29, 2016}}</ref> The board noted that the piece was not a \"qualified endorsement\" of Democratic nominee [[Hillary Clinton]], for whom the board was unable to reach a consensus for endorsing (some editorial board members expressed that Clinton's public service record would help her \"serve the nation ably as its president,\" while others had \"serious reservations about [her] sense of entitlement, [...] lack of candor and [...] [[Hillary Clinton email controversy|extreme carelessness in handling classified information]]\"), endorsing instead [[tactical voting]] against Trump and GOP seats in swing states, advising voters to decide whether to vote for either Clinton, [[Libertarian Party (United States)|Libertarian]] nominee [[Gary Johnson]], [[Green Party of the United States|Green Party]] nominee [[Jill Stein]] or a write-in candidate for President;

[[Geodynamical]] phenomena include [[crust (geology)|crustal]] motion, [[tide]]s and [[polar motion]], which can be studied by designing global and national [[control networks]], applying [[Space techniques|space]] and terrestrial techniques and relying on [[Geodetic datum|datums]] and [[coordinate system]]s.\n\n== Definition ==\nThe word geodesy comes from the [[Ancient Greek]] word {{lang|grc|\u03b3\u03b5\u03c9\u03b4\u03b1\u03b9\u03c3\u03af\u03b1}} ''geodaisia'' (literally, \"division of Earth\").\n\nIt is primarily concerned with positioning within the [[time|temporally]] varying gravity field. Geodesy in the [[German language|German]]-speaking world is divided into \"higher geodesy\" (\"''Erdmessung''\" or \"''h\u00f6here Geod\u00e4sie''\"), which is concerned with measuring Earth on the global scale, and \"practical geodesy\" or \"engineering geodesy\" (\"''Ingenieurgeod\u00e4sie''\"), which is concerned with measuring specific parts or regions of Earth, and which includes [[surveying]]. Such geodetic operations are also applied to other astronomical bodies in the [[solar system]]. It is also the science of measuring and understanding Earth's geometric shape, orientation in space, and gravity field.\n\nTo a large extent, the shape of Earth is the result of [[Earth's rotation|rotation]], which causes its [[equatorial bulge]], and the competition of geological processes such as the [[Continental collision|collision of plates]] and of [[Volcano|volcanism]], resisted by Earth's [[gravity]] field. This applies to the solid surface, the liquid surface ([[dynamic sea surface topography]]) and [[Earth's atmosphere]]. For this reason, the study of Earth's [[gravity field]] is called [[physical geodesy]].\n\n== History ==\n{{main|History of geodesy}}\n\n== Geoid and reference ellipsoid ==\n{{see also|Geoid}}\n\nThe [[geoid]] is essentially the figure of Earth abstracted from its topographical features. It is an idealized equilibrium surface of [[sea water]], the [[mean sea level]] surface in the absence of [[Ocean current|currents]] and [[Atmospheric pressure|air pressure]] variations, and continued under the continental masses. The geoid, unlike the [[reference ellipsoid]], is irregular and too complicated to serve as the computational surface on which to solve geometrical problems like point positioning. The geometrical separation between the geoid and the reference ellipsoid is called the geoidal [[wiktionary:undulate|undulation]]. It varies globally between \u00b1110&nbsp;m, when referred to the GRS&nbsp;80 ellipsoid.\n\nA [[reference ellipsoid]], customarily chosen to be the same size (volume) as the geoid, is described by its semi-major axis (equatorial\nradius) ''a'' and flattening ''f''. The quantity ''f''&nbsp;= {{sfrac|''a'' \u2212 ''b''|''a''}}, where ''b'' is the semi-minor axis (polar radius), is a purely geometrical one. The mechanical ellipticity of Earth (dynamical flattening, symbol ''J''<sub>2</sub>) can be determined to high precision by observation of satellite [[Orbital perturbation analysis|orbit perturbations]]. Its relationship with the geometrical flattening is indirect. The relationship depends on the internal density distribution, or, in simplest terms, the degree of central concentration of mass.\n\nThe 1980 Geodetic Reference System ([[GRS80|GRS&nbsp;80]]) posited a 6,378,137&nbsp;m semi-major axis and a 1:298.257 flattening. This system was adopted at the XVII General Assembly of the International Union of Geodesy and Geophysics ([[IUGG]]). It is essentially the basis for geodetic positioning by the [[Global Positioning System]] (GPS) and is thus also in widespread use outside the geodetic community. The numerous systems that countries have used to create maps and charts are becoming obsolete as countries increasingly move to global, geocentric reference systems using the GRS&nbsp;80 reference ellipsoid.\n\nThe geoid is \"realizable\", meaning it can be consistently located on Earth by suitable simple measurements from physical objects like a tide gauge. The geoid can, therefore, be considered a real surface. The reference ellipsoid, however, has many possible instantiations and is not readily realizable, therefore it is an abstract surface. The third primary surface of geodetic interest\u2014the topographic surface of Earth\u2014is a realizable surface.\n\n== Coordinate systems in space ==\n{{see also|Geodetic system}}\n\nThe locations of points in three-dimensional space are most conveniently described by three [[cartesian coordinate system|cartesian]] or rectangular coordinates, ''X'', ''Y'' and ''Z''. Since the advent of satellite positioning, such coordinate systems are typically [[geocentric]]: the ''Z''-axis is aligned with Earth's (conventional or instantaneous) rotation axis.\n\nPrior to the era of [[satellite geodesy]], the coordinate systems associated with a geodetic [[datum (geodesy)|datum]] attempted to be [[geocentric]], but their origins differed from the geocenter by hundreds of meters, due to regional deviations in the direction of the [[plumbline]] (vertical). These regional geodetic data, such as [[ED50|ED&nbsp;50]] (European Datum 1950) or [[North American Datum#North American Datum of 1927|NAD&nbsp;27]] (North American Datum 1927) have ellipsoids associated with them that are regional \"best fits\" to the [[geoid]]s within their areas of validity, minimizing the deflections of the vertical over these areas.\n\nIt is only because [[Global Positioning System|GPS]] satellites orbit about the geocenter, that this point becomes naturally the origin of a coordinate system defined by satellite geodetic means, as the satellite positions in space are themselves computed in such a system.\n\nGeocentric coordinate systems used in geodesy can be divided naturally into two classes:\n# [[Inertial]] reference systems, where the coordinate axes retain their orientation relative to the [[fixed star]]s, or equivalently, to the rotation axes of ideal [[gyroscopes]]; the ''X''-axis points to the [[vernal equinox]]\n# Co-rotating, also [[ECEF]] (\"Earth Centred, Earth Fixed\"), where the axes are attached to the solid body of Earth. The ''X''-axis lies within the [[Greenwich meridian|Greenwich]] observatory's [[Meridian (geography)|meridian]] plane.\n\nThe coordinate transformation between these two systems is described to good approximation by (apparent) [[sidereal time]], which takes into account variations in Earth's axial rotation ([[day|length-of-day]] variations). A more accurate description also takes [[polar motion]] into account, a phenomenon closely monitored by geodesists.\n\n=== Coordinate systems in the plane ===\n[[File:Litography archive of the Bayerisches Vermessungsamt.jpg|thumb|A [[Munich]] archive with [[lithography]] plates of maps of [[Bavaria]]]]\nIn [[surveying]] and [[map]]ping, important fields of application of geodesy, two general types of coordinate systems are used in the plane:\n\n# Plano-polar, in which points in a plane are defined by a distance ''s'' from a specified point along a ray having a specified direction ''\u03b1'' with respect to a base line or axis;\n# Rectangular, points are defined by distances from two perpendicular axes called ''x'' and ''y''. It is geodetic practice\u2014contrary to the mathematical convention\u2014to let the ''x''-axis point to the north and the ''y''-axis to the east.\n\nRectangular coordinates in the plane can be used intuitively with respect to one's current location, in which case the ''x''-axis will point to the local north. More formally, such coordinates can be obtained from three-dimensional coordinates using the artifice of a [[map projection]]. It is ''not'' possible to map the curved surface of Earth onto a flat map surface without deformation. The compromise most often chosen\u2014called a [[conformal projection]]\u2014preserves angles and length ratios, so that small circles are mapped as small circles and small squares as squares.\n\nAn example of such a projection is UTM ([[Universal Transverse Mercator]]). Within the map plane, we have rectangular coordinates ''x'' and ''y''. In this case, the north direction used for reference is the ''map'' north, not the ''local'' north. The difference between the two is called [[Transverse Mercator projection#Convergence|meridian convergence]].\n\nIt is easy enough to \"translate\" between polar and rectangular coordinates in the plane: let, as above, direction and distance be ''\u03b1'' and ''s'' respectively, then we have\n\n:<math>\\begin{align}\nx &= s \\cos \\alpha\\\\\ny &= s \\sin \\alpha\n\\end{align}</math>\n\nThe reverse transformation is given by:\n\n:<math>\\begin{align}\ns &= \\sqrt{x^2 + y^2}\\\\\n\\alpha &= \\arctan\\frac{y}{x}.\n\\end{align}</math>\n\n== Heights ==\nIn geodesy, point or terrain ''[[height]]s'' are \"[[above sea level]]\", an irregular, physically defined surface. \nHeights come in the following variants:\n\n# [[Orthometric height]]s\n# [[Normal height]]s\n# [[Geopotential height]]s\n\nEach has its advantages and disadvantages. Both orthometric and normal heights are heights in metres above sea level, whereas geopotential numbers are measures of potential energy (unit: m<sup>2</sup>&nbsp;s<sup>\u22122</sup>) and not metric. Orthometric and normal heights differ in the precise way in which mean sea level is conceptually continued under the continental masses. The reference surface for orthometric heights is the [[geoid]], an equipotential surface approximating mean sea level.\n\n''None'' of these heights is in any way related to '''geodetic''' or '''ellipsoidial''' heights, which express the height of a point above the [[reference ellipsoid]]. Satellite positioning receivers typically provide ellipsoidal heights, unless they are fitted with special conversion software based on a model of the [[geoid]].\n\n== Geodetic data ==\nBecause geodetic point coordinates (and heights) are always obtained in a system that has been constructed itself using real observations, geodesists introduce the concept of a \"geodetic datum\": a physical realization of a coordinate system used for describing point locations. The realization is the result of ''choosing'' conventional coordinate values for one or more datum points.\n\nIn the case of height data, it suffices to choose ''one'' datum point: the reference benchmark, typically a tide gauge at the shore. Thus we have vertical data like the NAP ([[Normaal Amsterdams Peil]]), the North American Vertical Datum 1988 (NAVD&nbsp;88), the Kronstadt datum, the Trieste datum, and so on.\n\nIn case of plane or spatial coordinates, we typically need several datum points. A regional, ellipsoidal datum like [[ED50|ED&nbsp;50]] can be fixed by prescribing the [[undulation of the geoid]] and the deflection of the vertical in ''one'' datum point, in this case the Helmert Tower in [[Potsdam]]. However, an overdetermined ensemble of datum points can also be used.\n\nChanging the coordinates of a point set referring to one datum, so to make them refer to another datum, is called a ''datum transformation''. In the case of vertical data, this consists of simply adding a constant shift to all height values. In the case of plane or spatial coordinates, datum transformation takes the form of a similarity or ''Helmert transformation'', consisting of a rotation and scaling operation in addition to a simple translation. In the plane, a [[Helmert transformation]] has four parameters; in space, seven.\n\n;A note on terminology\n\nIn the abstract, a coordinate system as used in mathematics and geodesy is called a \"coordinate system\" in [[International Organization for Standardization|ISO]] terminology, whereas the [[International Earth Rotation and Reference Systems Service]] (IERS) uses the term \"reference system\". When these coordinates are realized by choosing datum points and fixing a geodetic datum, ISO says \"coordinate reference system\", while IERS says \"reference frame\". The ISO term for a datum transformation again is a \"coordinate transformation\".<ref>(ISO 19111: Spatial referencing by coordinates).</ref>\n\n== Point positioning ==\n[[File:Geodetic Control Mark.jpg|250px|thumb|right|Geodetic Control Mark (example of a [[Benchmark (surveying)|deep benchmark]])]]\n\nPoint positioning is the determination of the coordinates of a point on land, at sea, or in space with respect to a coordinate system. Point position is solved by computation from measurements linking the known positions of terrestrial or extraterrestrial points with the unknown terrestrial position. This may involve transformations between or among astronomical and terrestrial coordinate systems. The known points used for point positioning can be [[triangulation]] points of a higher-order network or [[Global Positioning System|GPS]] satellites.\n\nTraditionally, a hierarchy of networks has been built to allow point positioning within a country. Highest in the hierarchy were triangulation networks. These were densified into networks of [[traverse (surveying)|traverse]]s ([[polygons]]), into which local mapping surveying measurements, usually with measuring tape, [[Corner reflector|corner prism]], and the familiar{{where?|date=January 2017}} red and white poles, are tied.\n\nNowadays all but special measurements (e.g., underground or high-precision engineering measurements) are performed with [[Global Positioning System|GPS]]. The higher-order networks are measured with [[Global Positioning System|static GPS]], using differential measurement to determine vectors between terrestrial points. These vectors are then adjusted in traditional network fashion. A global polyhedron of permanently operating GPS stations under the auspices of the [[IERS]] is used to define a single global, geocentric reference frame which serves as the \"zero order\" global reference to which national measurements are attached.\n\nFor [[surveying]] mappings, frequently [[Real Time Kinematic]] GPS is employed, tying in the unknown points with known terrestrial points close by in real time.\n\nOne purpose of point positioning is the provision of known points for mapping measurements, also known as (horizontal and vertical) control.\nIn every country, thousands of such known points exist and are normally documented by national mapping agencies. Surveyors involved in real estate and insurance will use these to tie their local measurements.\n\n== Geodetic problems ==\n{{Main|Geodesics on an ellipsoid}}\n\nIn geometric geodesy, two standard problems exist\u2014the first (direct or forward) and the second (inverse or reverse).\n\n;First (direct or forward) geodetic problem\n\n: Given a point (in terms of its coordinates) and the direction ([[azimuth]]) and [[distance]] from that point to a second point, determine (the coordinates of) that second point.\n\n;Second (inverse or reverse) geodetic problem\n\n: Given two points, determine the azimuth and length of the line (straight line, arc or [[geodesic]]) that connects them.\n\nIn plane geometry (valid for small areas on Earth's surface), the solutions to both problems reduce to simple [[trigonometry]].\nOn a sphere, however, the solution is significantly more complex, because in the inverse problem the azimuths will differ between the two end points of the connecting [[great circle]], arc.\n\nOn the ellipsoid of revolution, geodesics may be written in terms of elliptic integrals, which are usually evaluated in terms of a series expansion\u2014see, for example, [[Vincenty's formulae]]. In the general case, the solution is called the [[geodesic]] for the surface considered. The [[differential equation]]s for the [[geodesic]] can be solved numerically.\n\n== Observational concepts ==\nHere we define some basic observational concepts, like angles and coordinates, defined in geodesy (and [[astronomy]] as well), mostly from the viewpoint of the local observer.\n\n* '''[[Plumbline]]''' or '''vertical''': the direction of local gravity, or the line that results by following it.\n* '''[[Zenith]]''': the point on the [[celestial sphere]] where the direction of the gravity vector in a point, extended upwards, intersects it. It is more correct to call it a '''direction''' rather than a point.\n* '''[[Nadir]]''': the opposite point\u2014or rather, direction\u2014where the direction of gravity extended downward intersects the (obscured) celestial sphere.\n* '''Celestial horizon''': a plane perpendicular to a point's gravity vector.\n* '''[[Azimuth]]''': the direction angle within the plane of the horizon, typically counted clockwise from the north (in geodesy and astronomy) or the south (in France).\n* '''[[Elevation]]''': the angular height of an object above the horizon, Alternatively [[zenith distance]], being equal to 90 degrees minus elevation.\n* '''Local topocentric coordinates''': azimuth (direction angle within the plane of the horizon), elevation angle (or zenith angle), distance.\n* '''North [[celestial pole]]''': the extension of Earth's ([[precession|precessing]] and [[nutation|nutating]]) instantaneous spin axis extended northward to intersect the celestial sphere. (Similarly for the south celestial pole.)\n* '''Celestial equator''': the (instantaneous) intersection of Earth's equatorial plane with the celestial sphere.\n* '''[[meridian (geography)|Meridian]] plane''': any plane perpendicular to the celestial equator and containing the celestial poles.\n* '''Local meridian''': the plane containing the direction to the zenith and the direction to the celestial pole.\n\n== Measurements ==\n{{further|Satellite geodesy|Geodetic astronomy|Surveying|Gravimetry|Levelling}}\n\n[[File:Stephen Merkowitz NASA's Space Geodesy Project.ogv|thumb|350px|A NASA project manager talks about his work for the [[Space geodesy|Space Geodesy]] Project, including an overview of its four fundamental techniques: GPS, [[very-long-baseline interferometry|VLBI]], [[Satellite laser ranging|SLR]], and [[DORIS (geodesy)|DORIS]].]]\n\nThe level is used for determining height differences and height reference systems, commonly referred to [[mean sea level]]. The traditional [[spirit level]] produces these practically most useful heights above [[sea level]] directly; the more economical use of GPS instruments for height determination requires precise knowledge of the figure of the [[geoid]], as GPS only gives heights above the [[GRS80]] reference ellipsoid. As geoid knowledge accumulates, one may expect the use of GPS heighting to spread.\n\nThe [[theodolite]] is used to measure horizontal and vertical angles to target points. These angles are referred to the local vertical. The [[tacheometer]] additionally determines, electronically or [[Electro-optics|electro-optically]], the distance to target, and is highly automated to even robotic in its operations. The method of [[free station position]] is widely used.\n\nFor local detail surveys, tacheometers are commonly employed although the old-fashioned rectangular technique using angle prism and steel tape is still an inexpensive alternative. Real-time kinematic (RTK) GPS techniques are used as well. Data collected are tagged and recorded digitally for entry into a [[Geographic information system|Geographic Information System]] (GIS) database.\n\nGeodetic [[Global Positioning System|GPS]] receivers produce directly three-dimensional coordinates in a [[geocentric]] coordinate frame. Such a frame is, e.g., [[WGS84]], or the frames that are regularly produced and published by the International Earth Rotation and Reference Systems Service ([[IERS]]).\n\nGPS receivers have almost completely replaced terrestrial instruments for large-scale base network surveys. For planet-wide geodetic surveys, previously impossible, we can still mention [[satellite laser ranging]] (SLR) and [[lunar laser ranging]] (LLR) and [[very-long-baseline interferometry]] (VLBI) techniques. All these techniques also serve to monitor irregularities in Earth's rotation as well as plate tectonic motions.\n\n[[Gravity]] is measured using [[gravimeters]], of which there are two kinds. First, \"absolute gravimeters\" are based on measuring the acceleration of [[free fall]] (e.g., of a reflecting prism in a [[vacuum tube]]). They are used to establish the vertical geospatial control and can be used in the field. Second, \"relative gravimeters\" are spring-based and are more common. They are used in gravity surveys over large areas for establishing the figure of the geoid over these areas. The most accurate relative gravimeters are called \"superconducting\" gravimeters, which are sensitive to one-thousandth of one-billionth of Earth-surface gravity. Twenty-some superconducting gravimeters are used worldwide for studying Earth's [[tide]]s, [[rotation]], interior, and [[ocean]] and atmospheric loading, as well as for verifying the Newtonian constant of [[gravitation]].\n\nIn the future, gravity and altitude, will be measured by relativistic [[time dilation]] measured by [[Atomic clock#Strontium optical clocks|strontium optical clocks]].\n\n== Units and measures on the ellipsoid ==\nGeographical [[latitude]] and [[longitude]] are stated in the units degree, minute of arc, and second of arc. They are ''angles'', not metric\nmeasures, and describe the ''direction'' of the local normal to the [[reference ellipsoid]] of revolution. This is ''approximately'' the same as the direction of the plumbline, i.e., local gravity, which is also the normal to the geoid surface. For this reason, astronomical position determination \u2013 measuring the direction of the plumbline by astronomical means \u2013 works fairly well provided an ellipsoidal model of the figure of Earth is used.\n\nOne geographical mile, defined as one minute of arc on the equator, equals 1,855.32571922 m. One [[nautical mile]] is one minute of astronomical latitude. The radius of curvature of the ellipsoid varies with latitude, being the longest at the pole and the shortest at the equator as is the nautical mile.\n\nA metre was originally defined as the 10-millionth part of the length from equator to North Pole along the meridian through Paris (the target was not quite reached in actual implementation, so that is off by 200 [[Parts-per notation#ppm|ppm]] in the current definitions). This means that one kilometre is roughly equal to (1/40,000) * 360 * 60 meridional minutes of arc, which equals 0.54 nautical mile, though this is not exact because the two units are defined on different bases (the international nautical mile is defined as exactly 1,852 m, corresponding to a rounding of 1,000/0.54 m to four digits).\n\n== Temporal change ==\nIn geodesy, temporal change can be studied by a variety of techniques.

[[Geodynamical]] phenomena include [[crust (geology)|crustal]] motion, [[tide]]s and [[polar motion]], which can be studied by designing global and national [[control networks]], applying [[Space techniques|space]] and terrestrial techniques and relying on [[Geodetic datum|datums]] and [[coordinate system]]s.\n\n== Definition ==\nThe word geodesy comes from the [[Ancient Greek]] word {{lang|grc|\u03b3\u03b5\u03c9\u03b4\u03b1\u03b9\u03c3\u03af\u03b1}} ''geodaisia'' (literally, \"division of Earth\").\n\nIt is primarily concerned with positioning within the [[time|temporally]] varying gravity field. Geodesy in the [[German language|German]]-speaking world is divided into \"higher geodesy\" (\"''Erdmessung''\" or \"''h\u00f6here Geod\u00e4sie''\"), which is concerned with measuring Earth on the global scale, and \"practical geodesy\" or \"engineering geodesy\" (\"''Ingenieurgeod\u00e4sie''\"), which is concerned with measuring specific parts or regions of Earth, and which includes [[surveying]]. Such geodetic operations are also applied to other astronomical bodies in the [[solar system]]. It is also the science of measuring and understanding Earth's geometric shape, orientation in space, and gravity field.\n\nTo a large extent, the shape of Earth is the result of [[Earth's rotation|rotation]], which causes its [[equatorial bulge]], and the competition of geological processes such as the [[Continental collision|collision of plates]] and of [[Volcano|volcanism]], resisted by Earth's [[gravity]] field. This applies to the solid surface, the liquid surface ([[dynamic sea surface topography]]) and [[Earth's atmosphere]]. For this reason, the study of Earth's [[gravity field]] is called [[physical geodesy]].\n\n== History ==\n{{main|History of geodesy}}\n\n== Geoid and reference ellipsoid ==\n{{see also|Geoid}}\n\nThe [[geoid]] is essentially the figure of Earth abstracted from its topographical features. It is an idealized equilibrium surface of [[sea water]], the [[mean sea level]] surface in the absence of [[Ocean current|currents]] and [[Atmospheric pressure|air pressure]] variations, and continued under the continental masses. The geoid, unlike the [[reference ellipsoid]], is irregular and too complicated to serve as the computational surface on which to solve geometrical problems like point positioning. The geometrical separation between the geoid and the reference ellipsoid is called the geoidal [[wiktionary:undulate|undulation]]. It varies globally between \u00b1110&nbsp;m, when referred to the GRS&nbsp;80 ellipsoid.\n\nA [[reference ellipsoid]], customarily chosen to be the same size (volume) as the geoid, is described by its semi-major axis (equatorial\nradius) ''a'' and flattening ''f''. The quantity ''f''&nbsp;= {{sfrac|''a'' \u2212 ''b''|''a''}}, where ''b'' is the semi-minor axis (polar radius), is a purely geometrical one. The mechanical ellipticity of Earth (dynamical flattening, symbol ''J''<sub>2</sub>) can be determined to high precision by observation of satellite [[Orbital perturbation analysis|orbit perturbations]]. Its relationship with the geometrical flattening is indirect. The relationship depends on the internal density distribution, or, in simplest terms, the degree of central concentration of mass.\n\nThe 1980 Geodetic Reference System ([[GRS80|GRS&nbsp;80]]) posited a 6,378,137&nbsp;m semi-major axis and a 1:298.257 flattening. This system was adopted at the XVII General Assembly of the International Union of Geodesy and Geophysics ([[IUGG]]). It is essentially the basis for geodetic positioning by the [[Global Positioning System]] (GPS) and is thus also in widespread use outside the geodetic community. The numerous systems that countries have used to create maps and charts are becoming obsolete as countries increasingly move to global, geocentric reference systems using the GRS&nbsp;80 reference ellipsoid.\n\nThe geoid is \"realizable\", meaning it can be consistently located on Earth by suitable simple measurements from physical objects like a tide gauge. The geoid can, therefore, be considered a real surface. The reference ellipsoid, however, has many possible instantiations and is not readily realizable, therefore it is an abstract surface. The third primary surface of geodetic interest\u2014the topographic surface of Earth\u2014is a realizable surface.\n\n== Coordinate systems in space ==\n{{see also|Geodetic system}}\n\nThe locations of points in three-dimensional space are most conveniently described by three [[cartesian coordinate system|cartesian]] or rectangular coordinates, ''X'', ''Y'' and ''Z''. Since the advent of satellite positioning, such coordinate systems are typically [[geocentric]]: the ''Z''-axis is aligned with Earth's (conventional or instantaneous) rotation axis.\n\nPrior to the era of [[satellite geodesy]], the coordinate systems associated with a geodetic [[datum (geodesy)|datum]] attempted to be [[geocentric]], but their origins differed from the geocenter by hundreds of meters, due to regional deviations in the direction of the [[plumbline]] (vertical). These regional geodetic data, such as [[ED50|ED&nbsp;50]] (European Datum 1950) or [[North American Datum#North American Datum of 1927|NAD&nbsp;27]] (North American Datum 1927) have ellipsoids associated with them that are regional \"best fits\" to the [[geoid]]s within their areas of validity, minimizing the deflections of the vertical over these areas.\n\nIt is only because [[Global Positioning System|GPS]] satellites orbit about the geocenter, that this point becomes naturally the origin of a coordinate system defined by satellite geodetic means, as the satellite positions in space are themselves computed in such a system.\n\nGeocentric coordinate systems used in geodesy can be divided naturally into two classes:\n# [[Inertial]] reference systems, where the coordinate axes retain their orientation relative to the [[fixed star]]s, or equivalently, to the rotation axes of ideal [[gyroscopes]]; the ''X''-axis points to the [[vernal equinox]]\n# Co-rotating, also [[ECEF]] (\"Earth Centred, Earth Fixed\"), where the axes are attached to the solid body of Earth. The ''X''-axis lies within the [[Greenwich meridian|Greenwich]] observatory's [[Meridian (geography)|meridian]] plane.\n\nThe coordinate transformation between these two systems is described to good approximation by (apparent) [[sidereal time]], which takes into account variations in Earth's axial rotation ([[day|length-of-day]] variations). A more accurate description also takes [[polar motion]] into account, a phenomenon closely monitored by geodesists.\n\n=== Coordinate systems in the plane ===\n[[File:Litography archive of the Bayerisches Vermessungsamt.jpg|thumb|A [[Munich]] archive with [[lithography]] plates of maps of [[Bavaria]]]]\nIn [[surveying]] and [[map]]ping, important fields of application of geodesy, two general types of coordinate systems are used in the plane:\n\n# Plano-polar, in which points in a plane are defined by a distance ''s'' from a specified point along a ray having a specified direction ''\u03b1'' with respect to a base line or axis;\n# Rectangular, points are defined by distances from two perpendicular axes called ''x'' and ''y''. It is geodetic practice\u2014contrary to the mathematical convention\u2014to let the ''x''-axis point to the north and the ''y''-axis to the east.\n\nRectangular coordinates in the plane can be used intuitively with respect to one's current location, in which case the ''x''-axis will point to the local north. More formally, such coordinates can be obtained from three-dimensional coordinates using the artifice of a [[map projection]]. It is ''not'' possible to map the curved surface of Earth onto a flat map surface without deformation. The compromise most often chosen\u2014called a [[conformal projection]]\u2014preserves angles and length ratios, so that small circles are mapped as small circles and small squares as squares.\n\nAn example of such a projection is UTM ([[Universal Transverse Mercator]]). Within the map plane, we have rectangular coordinates ''x'' and ''y''. In this case, the north direction used for reference is the ''map'' north, not the ''local'' north. The difference between the two is called [[Transverse Mercator projection#Convergence|meridian convergence]].\n\nIt is easy enough to \"translate\" between polar and rectangular coordinates in the plane: let, as above, direction and distance be ''\u03b1'' and ''s'' respectively, then we have\n\n:<math>\\begin{align}\nx &= s \\cos \\alpha\\\\\ny &= s \\sin \\alpha\n\\end{align}</math>\n\nThe reverse transformation is given by:\n\n:<math>\\begin{align}\ns &= \\sqrt{x^2 + y^2}\\\\\n\\alpha &= \\arctan\\frac{y}{x}.\n\\end{align}</math>\n\n== Heights ==\nIn geodesy, point or terrain ''[[height]]s'' are \"[[above sea level]]\", an irregular, physically defined surface. \nHeights come in the following variants:\n\n# [[Orthometric height]]s\n# [[Normal height]]s\n# [[Geopotential height]]s\n\nEach has its advantages and disadvantages. Both orthometric and normal heights are heights in metres above sea level, whereas geopotential numbers are measures of potential energy (unit: m<sup>2</sup>&nbsp;s<sup>\u22122</sup>) and not metric. Orthometric and normal heights differ in the precise way in which mean sea level is conceptually continued under the continental masses. The reference surface for orthometric heights is the [[geoid]], an equipotential surface approximating mean sea level.\n\n''None'' of these heights is in any way related to '''geodetic''' or '''ellipsoidial''' heights, which express the height of a point above the [[reference ellipsoid]]. Satellite positioning receivers typically provide ellipsoidal heights, unless they are fitted with special conversion software based on a model of the [[geoid]].\n\n== Geodetic data ==\nBecause geodetic point coordinates (and heights) are always obtained in a system that has been constructed itself using real observations, geodesists introduce the concept of a \"geodetic datum\": a physical realization of a coordinate system used for describing point locations. The realization is the result of ''choosing'' conventional coordinate values for one or more datum points.\n\nIn the case of height data, it suffices to choose ''one'' datum point: the reference benchmark, typically a tide gauge at the shore. Thus we have vertical data like the NAP ([[Normaal Amsterdams Peil]]), the North American Vertical Datum 1988 (NAVD&nbsp;88), the Kronstadt datum, the Trieste datum, and so on.\n\nIn case of plane or spatial coordinates, we typically need several datum points. A regional, ellipsoidal datum like [[ED50|ED&nbsp;50]] can be fixed by prescribing the [[undulation of the geoid]] and the deflection of the vertical in ''one'' datum point, in this case the Helmert Tower in [[Potsdam]]. However, an overdetermined ensemble of datum points can also be used.\n\nChanging the coordinates of a point set referring to one datum, so to make them refer to another datum, is called a ''datum transformation''. In the case of vertical data, this consists of simply adding a constant shift to all height values. In the case of plane or spatial coordinates, datum transformation takes the form of a similarity or ''Helmert transformation'', consisting of a rotation and scaling operation in addition to a simple translation. In the plane, a [[Helmert transformation]] has four parameters; in space, seven.\n\n;A note on terminology\n\nIn the abstract, a coordinate system as used in mathematics and geodesy is called a \"coordinate system\" in [[International Organization for Standardization|ISO]] terminology, whereas the [[International Earth Rotation and Reference Systems Service]] (IERS) uses the term \"reference system\". When these coordinates are realized by choosing datum points and fixing a geodetic datum, ISO says \"coordinate reference system\", while IERS says \"reference frame\". The ISO term for a datum transformation again is a \"coordinate transformation\".<ref>(ISO 19111: Spatial referencing by coordinates).</ref>\n\n== Point positioning ==\n[[File:Geodetic Control Mark.jpg|250px|thumb|right|Geodetic Control Mark (example of a [[Benchmark (surveying)|deep benchmark]])]]\n\nPoint positioning is the determination of the coordinates of a point on land, at sea, or in space with respect to a coordinate system. Point position is solved by computation from measurements linking the known positions of terrestrial or extraterrestrial points with the unknown terrestrial position. This may involve transformations between or among astronomical and terrestrial coordinate systems. The known points used for point positioning can be [[triangulation]] points of a higher-order network or [[Global Positioning System|GPS]] satellites.\n\nTraditionally, a hierarchy of networks has been built to allow point positioning within a country. Highest in the hierarchy were triangulation networks. These were densified into networks of [[traverse (surveying)|traverse]]s ([[polygons]]), into which local mapping surveying measurements, usually with measuring tape, [[Corner reflector|corner prism]], and the familiar{{where?|date=January 2017}} red and white poles, are tied.\n\nNowadays all but special measurements (e.g., underground or high-precision engineering measurements) are performed with [[Global Positioning System|GPS]]. The higher-order networks are measured with [[Global Positioning System|static GPS]], using differential measurement to determine vectors between terrestrial points. These vectors are then adjusted in traditional network fashion. A global polyhedron of permanently operating GPS stations under the auspices of the [[IERS]] is used to define a single global, geocentric reference frame which serves as the \"zero order\" global reference to which national measurements are attached.\n\nFor [[surveying]] mappings, frequently [[Real Time Kinematic]] GPS is employed, tying in the unknown points with known terrestrial points close by in real time.\n\nOne purpose of point positioning is the provision of known points for mapping measurements, also known as (horizontal and vertical) control.\nIn every country, thousands of such known points exist and are normally documented by national mapping agencies. Surveyors involved in real estate and insurance will use these to tie their local measurements.\n\n== Geodetic problems ==\n{{Main|Geodesics on an ellipsoid}}\n\nIn geometric geodesy, two standard problems exist\u2014the first (direct or forward) and the second (inverse or reverse).\n\n;First (direct or forward) geodetic problem\n\n: Given a point (in terms of its coordinates) and the direction ([[azimuth]]) and [[distance]] from that point to a second point, determine (the coordinates of) that second point.\n\n;Second (inverse or reverse) geodetic problem\n\n: Given two points, determine the azimuth and length of the line (straight line, arc or [[geodesic]]) that connects them.\n\nIn plane geometry (valid for small areas on Earth's surface), the solutions to both problems reduce to simple [[trigonometry]].\nOn a sphere, however, the solution is significantly more complex, because in the inverse problem the azimuths will differ between the two end points of the connecting [[great circle]], arc.\n\nOn the ellipsoid of revolution, geodesics may be written in terms of elliptic integrals, which are usually evaluated in terms of a series expansion\u2014see, for example, [[Vincenty's formulae]]. In the general case, the solution is called the [[geodesic]] for the surface considered. The [[differential equation]]s for the [[geodesic]] can be solved numerically.\n\n== Observational concepts ==\nHere we define some basic observational concepts, like angles and coordinates, defined in geodesy (and [[astronomy]] as well), mostly from the viewpoint of the local observer.\n\n* '''[[Plumbline]]''' or '''vertical''': the direction of local gravity, or the line that results by following it.\n* '''[[Zenith]]''': the point on the [[celestial sphere]] where the direction of the gravity vector in a point, extended upwards, intersects it. It is more correct to call it a '''direction''' rather than a point.\n* '''[[Nadir]]''': the opposite point\u2014or rather, direction\u2014where the direction of gravity extended downward intersects the (obscured) celestial sphere.\n* '''Celestial horizon''': a plane perpendicular to a point's gravity vector.\n* '''[[Azimuth]]''': the direction angle within the plane of the horizon, typically counted clockwise from the north (in geodesy and astronomy) or the south (in France).\n* '''[[Elevation]]''': the angular height of an object above the horizon, Alternatively [[zenith distance]], being equal to 90 degrees minus elevation.\n* '''Local topocentric coordinates''': azimuth (direction angle within the plane of the horizon), elevation angle (or zenith angle), distance.\n* '''North [[celestial pole]]''': the extension of Earth's ([[precession|precessing]] and [[nutation|nutating]]) instantaneous spin axis extended northward to intersect the celestial sphere. (Similarly for the south celestial pole.)\n* '''Celestial equator''': the (instantaneous) intersection of Earth's equatorial plane with the celestial sphere.\n* '''[[meridian (geography)|Meridian]] plane''': any plane perpendicular to the celestial equator and containing the celestial poles.\n* '''Local meridian''': the plane containing the direction to the zenith and the direction to the celestial pole.\n\n== Measurements ==\n{{further|Satellite geodesy|Geodetic astronomy|Surveying|Gravimetry|Levelling}}\n\n[[File:Stephen Merkowitz NASA's Space Geodesy Project.ogv|thumb|350px|A NASA project manager talks about his work for the [[Space geodesy|Space Geodesy]] Project, including an overview of its four fundamental techniques: GPS, [[very-long-baseline interferometry|VLBI]], [[Satellite laser ranging|SLR]], and [[DORIS (geodesy)|DORIS]].]]\n\nThe level is used for determining height differences and height reference systems, commonly referred to [[mean sea level]]. The traditional [[spirit level]] produces these practically most useful heights above [[sea level]] directly; the more economical use of GPS instruments for height determination requires precise knowledge of the figure of the [[geoid]], as GPS only gives heights above the [[GRS80]] reference ellipsoid. As geoid knowledge accumulates, one may expect the use of GPS heighting to spread.\n\nThe [[theodolite]] is used to measure horizontal and vertical angles to target points. These angles are referred to the local vertical. The [[tacheometer]] additionally determines, electronically or [[Electro-optics|electro-optically]], the distance to target, and is highly automated to even robotic in its operations. The method of [[free station position]] is widely used.\n\nFor local detail surveys, tacheometers are commonly employed although the old-fashioned rectangular technique using angle prism and steel tape is still an inexpensive alternative. Real-time kinematic (RTK) GPS techniques are used as well. Data collected are tagged and recorded digitally for entry into a [[Geographic information system|Geographic Information System]] (GIS) database.\n\nGeodetic [[Global Positioning System|GPS]] receivers produce directly three-dimensional coordinates in a [[geocentric]] coordinate frame. Such a frame is, e.g., [[WGS84]], or the frames that are regularly produced and published by the International Earth Rotation and Reference Systems Service ([[IERS]]).\n\nGPS receivers have almost completely replaced terrestrial instruments for large-scale base network surveys. For planet-wide geodetic surveys, previously impossible, we can still mention [[satellite laser ranging]] (SLR) and [[lunar laser ranging]] (LLR) and [[very-long-baseline interferometry]] (VLBI) techniques. All these techniques also serve to monitor irregularities in Earth's rotation as well as plate tectonic motions.\n\n[[Gravity]] is measured using [[gravimeters]], of which there are two kinds. First, \"absolute gravimeters\" are based on measuring the acceleration of [[free fall]] (e.g., of a reflecting prism in a [[vacuum tube]]). They are used to establish the vertical geospatial control and can be used in the field. Second, \"relative gravimeters\" are spring-based and are more common. They are used in gravity surveys over large areas for establishing the figure of the geoid over these areas. The most accurate relative gravimeters are called \"superconducting\" gravimeters, which are sensitive to one-thousandth of one-billionth of Earth-surface gravity. Twenty-some superconducting gravimeters are used worldwide for studying Earth's [[tide]]s, [[rotation]], interior, and [[ocean]] and atmospheric loading, as well as for verifying the Newtonian constant of [[gravitation]].\n\nIn the future, gravity and altitude, will be measured by relativistic [[time dilation]] measured by [[Atomic clock#Strontium optical clocks|strontium optical clocks]].\n\n== Units and measures on the ellipsoid ==\nGeographical [[latitude]] and [[longitude]] are stated in the units degree, minute of arc, and second of arc. They are ''angles'', not metric\nmeasures, and describe the ''direction'' of the local normal to the [[reference ellipsoid]] of revolution. This is ''approximately'' the same as the direction of the plumbline, i.e., local gravity, which is also the normal to the geoid surface. For this reason, astronomical position determination \u2013 measuring the direction of the plumbline by astronomical means \u2013 works fairly well provided an ellipsoidal model of the figure of Earth is used.\n\nOne geographical mile, defined as one minute of arc on the equator, equals 1,855.32571922 m. One [[nautical mile]] is one minute of astronomical latitude. The radius of curvature of the ellipsoid varies with latitude, being the longest at the pole and the shortest at the equator as is the nautical mile.\n\nA metre was originally defined as the 10-millionth part of the length from equator to North Pole along the meridian through Paris (the target was not quite reached in actual implementation, so that is off by 200 [[Parts-per notation#ppm|ppm]] in the current definitions). This means that one kilometre is roughly equal to (1/40,000) * 360 * 60 meridional minutes of arc, which equals 0.54 nautical mile, though this is not exact because the two units are defined on different bases (the international nautical mile is defined as exactly 1,852 m, corresponding to a rounding of 1,000/0.54 m to four digits).\n\n== Temporal change ==\nIn geodesy, temporal change can be studied by a variety of techniques. Points on Earth's surface change their location due to a variety of mechanisms:\n\n* Continental plate motion, [[plate tectonics]]\n* Episodic motion of tectonic origin, especially close to [[fault line]]s\n* Periodic effects due to tides\n* [[glaciation|Postglacial]] land uplift due to isostatic adjustment\n* Mass variations due to hydrological changes\n* Anthropogenic movements such as reservoir construction or [[petroleum]] or water extraction\n\nThe science of studying deformations and motions of Earth's crust and its solidity as a whole is called [[geodynamics]]. Often, study of Earth's irregular rotation is also included in its definition.\n\nTechniques for studying geodynamic phenomena on the global scale include:\n\n* Satellite positioning by [[Global Positioning System|GPS]]\n* [[Very-long-baseline interferometry]] (VLBI)\n* Satellite and lunar [[laser ranging]]\n* Regionally and locally precise levelling\n* Precise tacheometers\n* Monitoring of gravity change\n* [[Interferometric synthetic aperture radar]] (InSAR) using satellite images\n\n== Notable geodesists ==\n=== Mathematical geodesists before 1900 ===\n{{div col|colwidth=22em}}\n* [[Pythagoras]] 580\u2013490&nbsp;BC, [[ancient Greece]]<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.ngs.noaa.gov/PUBS_LIB/Geodesy4Layman/TR80003A.HTM|title=DEFENSE MAPPING AGENCY TECHNICAL REPORT 80-003|website=Ngs.noaa.gov|accessdate=8 December 2018}}</ref>\n* [[Eratosthenes]] 276\u2013194&nbsp;BC, ancient Greece\n* [[Hipparchus]] {{circa}} 190\u2013120&nbsp;BC, ancient Greece\n* [[Posidonius]] {{circa}} 135\u201351&nbsp;BC, ancient Greece\n* [[Claudius Ptolemy]] {{circa}} AD&nbsp;83\u2013168, [[Roman Empire]] ([[Roman Egypt]])\n* [[Al-Ma'mun]] 786\u2013833, [[Baghdad]] (Iraq/[[Mesopotamia]])\n* [[Abu Rayhan Biruni]] 973\u20131048, [[Greater Khorasan|Khorasan]] ([[Persia|Iran]]/[[Samanid Dynasty]])\n* [[Muhammad al-Idrisi]] 1100\u20131166, ([[Arabia]] & Sicily)\n* [[Regiomontanus]] 1436\u20131476, (Germany/Austria)\n* [[Abel Foullon]] 1513\u20131563 or 1565, (France)\n* [[Pedro Nunes]] 1502\u20131578 (Portugal)\n* [[Gerardus Mercator|Gerhard Mercator]] 1512\u20131594 (Belgium & Germany)\n* [[Willebrord Snellius|Snellius]] (Willebrord Snel van Royen) 1580\u20131626, [[Leiden]] (Netherlands)\n* [[Christiaan Huygens]] 1629\u20131695 (Netherlands)\n* [[Pierre Bouguer]] 1698\u20131758, (France & Peru)\n* [[Pierre de Maupertuis]] 1698\u20131759 (France)\n* [[Alexis Clairaut]] 1713\u20131765 (France)\n* [[Johann Heinrich Lambert]] 1728\u20131777 (France)\n* [[Roger Joseph Boscovich]] 1711\u20131787, ([[Rome]]/ [[Berlin]]/ [[Paris]])\n* [[Ino Tadataka]] 1745\u20131818, ([[Tokyo]])\n* [[Georg von Reichenbach]] 1771\u20131826, [[Bavaria]] (Germany)\n* [[Pierre-Simon Laplace]] 1749\u20131827, [[Paris]] (France)\n* [[Adrien-Marie Legendre|Adrien Marie Legendre]] 1752\u20131833, [[Paris]] (France)\n* [[Johann Georg von Soldner]] 1776\u20131833, [[Munich]] (Germany)\n* [[George Everest]] 1790\u20131866 (England and India)\n* [[Friedrich Wilhelm Bessel]] 1784\u20131846, [[K\u00f6nigsberg]] (Germany)\n* [[Heinrich Christian Schumacher]] 1780\u20131850 (Germany & Russian Empire)\n* [[Carl Friedrich Gauss]] 1777\u20131855, G\u00f6ttingen (Germany)\n* [[Friedrich Georg Wilhelm Struve]] 1793\u20131864, [[Tartu Observatory|Dorpat]] and [[Pulkovo Observatory|Pulkovo]] ([[Russian Empire]])\n* [[J.
