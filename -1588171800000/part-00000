He has a reputation for being involved in some of the most violent and bloody [[hardcore wrestling]] matches of all time.\n\nOne of Shreve's trademarks is a series of divot-like scars on his head that he has due to excessive use of [[Blading (professional wrestling)|blading]] during his career. The scars are so deep that, according to [[Mick Foley]], Shreve is able to put gambling chips into them. An amateur martial artist, Shreve also has knowledge of [[judo]] and [[karate]], often including this knowledge in his wrestling matches. This knowledge was mainly displayed by him using judo throws and Canadian chops. Hello everybody! I hope you're all doing well. Days will only get better. I'm Samantha I'm 17 and from Iowa. \n\n==Early life==\nShreve was born on January 11, 1941<ref name=\"wrestlingdata.com\"/><ref name=\"wrestlingmuseum.com\">{{cite web|url=http://www.wrestlingmuseum.com/pages/wrestlers/abdullah2.html|title=Professional Wrestling Online Museum \u2013 Abdullah the Butcher|website=www.wrestlingmuseum.com}}</ref><ref name=\"Madman\"/> and raised in [[Windsor, Ontario]], as part of a family of ten people in a deeply impoverished household.<ref name=\"Madman\">{{Cite web|url=http://slam.canoe.ca/Slam/Wrestling/2003/10/31/242993.html |title=Man or Madman? Abdullah in Hull| accessdate=July 18, 2008|publisher=slam.canoe.ca}}</ref> He learned [[karate]] and [[judo]] as a youth and, teaching fellow children in the backyard, claims to have eventually earned the title of seventh-degree grandmaster.<ref name=\"Madman\" />\n\n==Professional wrestling career==\nShreve caught the attention of [[Montreal]] promoter Jack Britton,<ref name=\"Madman\" /> and he soon made his professional wrestling debut at age 17 in 1958. He initially competed in numerous independent territories in Canada under such various monikers as '''Pussycat Pickens''', '''Kuroi Jujutsushi''' (The Black Wizard) and '''Zelis Amara'''. However, he ultimately created his gimmick of an evil [[Arabian]] sadist; and in a match against [[Gino Brito]]<ref name=\"Madman\" /> (Jack Britton's real-life son), the '''Abdullah the Butcher''' character first distinguished himself as one of the world's most feared rule breakers when he broke a chair over Brito's head and then beat him senseless with the leg.\n\nSince his gimmick required that he speak no English (though it was in actuality his native tongue), he possessed a number of managers over the course of his long career, including [[Gary Hart (wrestler)|Gary Hart]], [[Paul Jones (wrestler)|Paul Jones]], [[Eddie Creatchman]], Black Baron, [[Ernie Roth|The Grand Wizard]], [[James J. Dillon|J.J. Dillon]], [[Damien Kane]], [[Larry Sharpe (wrestler)|Larry Sharpe]], [[Hugo Savinovich]], [[Chicky Starr]], [[Oliver Humperdink]], Buddy Colt, George Cannon, [[Bearcat Wright]], Big Bad John, [[Tony Montana (Director)|Tony Montana]], Gentleman Jim Holiday, and Rock Hunter, who were all portrayed as \"handlers\" commissioned to control the Sudanese madman, while also doing most of the talking in promos and interviews. He has, however, spoken for himself in promos while in Japan.\n\n[[File:AbdullahTheButcher.jpg|thumb|left|Abdullah the Butcher in a match in 2004]]\nAs a result of his frequent traveling, Abdullah the Butcher usually served as more of a special attraction than as a consistent championship contender. Accordingly, Abdullah never did win a world heavyweight championship, though he would capture several regional titles during his career. He won his first major championship on October 23, 1967, when he teamed with Dr. Jerry Graham to defeat [[John Tolos|John]] & Carlos Tolos for the [[National Wrestling Alliance|NWA]]'s [[NWA Canadian Tag Team Championship (Vancouver version)|Canadian Tag Team Titles in Vancouver]]. A few years later, he ventured to the Montreal region, where he had three reigns as the IWA International Heavyweight Champion between 1969 and 1972, feuding against [[Ivan Koloff]] and [[Johnny Rougeau]]. He later served as one of the premier rule breakers in [[Stampede Wrestling|Calgary's Stampede]] territory, capturing the NWA Canadian Championship, as well as having six North American Heavyweight Title reigns during the early 1970s. On June 24, 1972, he defeated Ernie Ladd in Akron, Ohio, to capture his first of two [[NWF Heavyweight Championship]]s. In 1972, he wrestled a few matches for [[World Wide Wrestling Federation]]. Also he worked for [[Stampede Wrestling]] from 1970 to 1974. During the mid-1970s, he frequently performed in [[Detroit, Michigan]]'s Big-Time Wrestling territory, where he engaged in a rivalry against [[Ed Farhat|The Sheik]]. He teamed with \"Killer\" Tim Brooks to win the region's version of the NWA World Tag Team Titles before defeating Bobo Brazil on February 8, 1975, for the NWA United States Championship.\n\nIn addition to his successes in North America, Abdullah the Butcher also performed in the [[Far East]], [[Europe]], the [[Caribbean]], [[Australia]], and [[Africa]]. On March 12, 1974, he traveled all the way to [[New Zealand]], where he captured the British Empire Commonwealth Title by defeating the nation's champion [[John DaSilva]]. Abdullah also established himself as one of the premier attractions in [[Japan]], where he competed as part of the round-robin tournament that ultimately crowned [[Shohei Baba|Giant Baba]] as All-Japan's inaugural PWF Heavyweight Champion in February 1973. On October 18, 1978, Abdullah won that same PWF belt when he defeated European former AWA champion Billy Robinson; and then on October 13, 1980, he also beat [[Jumbo Tsuruta]] to capture the NWA United National Heavyweight Title. He also feuded with [[Terry Funk]] in [[Japan]], and Funk claims to have had one of his top three all-time greatest matches with Abdullah the Butcher.\n\nHe arrived in [[World Class Championship Wrestling]] (WCCW) in 1986, where he defeated [[Great Kabuki|The Great Kabuki]] for the Texas Brass Knuckles Title and waged war against the equally wild [[Bruiser Brody]]. In Puerto Rico, he was declared the very first WWC Universal Heavyweight Champion in July 1982 following three reigns as the Puerto Rican champion between 1978 and 1981.\n\nHe was introduced in [[World Championship Wrestling]] in a giant, gift-wrapped box.<ref name=\"mf202\">{{cite book | author = Mick Foley | title = Have A Nice Day: A Tale of Blood and Sweatsocks | publisher = HarperCollins | year = 2000 | isbn = 0-06-103101-1 | page = 202}}</ref> This giant box was to be Sting's birthday gift from [[Mick Foley|Cactus Jack]].<ref name=\"mf202\"/> Sting unwrapped his gift and Abdullah attacked him, leading to both Abdullah and Cactus feuding with Sting after the incident. The feud culminated in a \"Chamber of Horrors\" match at [[Halloween Havoc (1991)|Halloween Havoc 1991]], in which Cactus accidentally electrocuted Abdullah in an [[electric chair]], leading to a brief [[Feud (professional wrestling)|feud]] between the former allies. \n\nIn 1993, Abdullah arrived in [[Extreme Championship Wrestling|ECW]], where he participated in a storyline with Kevin Sullivan, Terry Funk and Stan Hansen, and wrestled at Ultra Clash and Bloodfest.\n\nIn October 1999, Abdullah took part in the ill-fated [[Heroes of Wrestling]] pay-per-view with a match against the [[One Man Gang]]. The match ended in a double count-out.\n\nIn late 2002, Abdullah made a one-night appearance in [[Ring of Honor]] as Homicide's partner, facing the Carnage Crew in a bloody [[Bunkhouse Brawl]] at ROH's Night of the Butcher.\n\nOn December 13, 2008, Shreve wrestled against [[Balls Mahoney]] in Bayamon Puerto Rico during the annual event WWC Lockout.\n\nDuring July 2009, he wrestled in [[Dragon Gate (wrestling)|Dragon Gate]] and [[Hustle (professional wrestling)|Hustle]]. He also wrestled at the [[New Japan Pro-Wrestling]] supershow [[Wrestle Kingdom IV in Tokyo Dome]] on January 4, 2010, as well as wrestling for Japanese independent promotion Osaka Pro Wrestling.\n\nIn 2009, Abdullah made an appearance at the Decatur Book Festival, facing off against author [[Michael Muhammad Knight]]. Abdullah pummeled Knight with chairs, forks, and a water cooler, not even stepping into the ring. Knight was taken from the festival in an ambulance and received 46 stitches. It was Right After Wrestling in March 2011, hosted by [[Arda Ocal]] and [[Jimmy Korderas]], that Abdullah admitted his favorite wrestler to face was actually [[Lou Thesz]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://radio.thescore.com/episodes/abdullah-the-butcher-raw-feb-28-2011 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=March 22, 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120717002804/http://radio.thescore.com/episodes/abdullah-the-butcher-raw-feb-28-2011 |archivedate=July 17, 2012 }}</ref>\n\nHis last match was on October 9, 2010 in a draw against [[Bull Buchanan]] at GCW Southern Legends Fan Fest.\n\nAlso in 2011, Abdullah returned to [[Georgia Championship Wrestling]] as a mentor and adviser to a local wrestler known as The Congo Warrior.\n\nOn October 20, 2018, it was announced that Abdullah will have his retirement ceremony during the Giant Baba 20th Anniversary Memorial Show on February 19, 2019 at Sumo Hall in Tokyo.\n\n==Legacy==\nThroughout his career, many [[video game]]s have included depictions of Abdullah the Butcher, either as playable characters or as enemies. Some of these, such as ''[[Legends of Wrestling II]]'', have included his name and direct likeness, whereas others such as ''[[HammerLock Wrestling]]'' and ''Appoooh'' include original characters inspired by Abdullah.\n\nCharacters in Japanese anime or manga are also frequently designed to resemble Abdullah the Butcher, often with his signature scars. Examples include Abdullah from ''[[Kinnikuman]]'', Abdullah the Criminal from ''[[One Piece]]'', and Mr. Heart from ''[[Fist of the North Star]]''.\n\n[[File:Abdullah the butcher.jpg|thumb|right|Abdullah the Butcher at his WWE Hall of Fame induction in 2011]]In 2007, the [[WWE]] and [[Jakks Pacific]] released an Abdullah the Butcher \"WWE Classic Superstars\" figure complete with the blade marks on top of his head. A DVD was also released named ''The Triumph and Tragedy of World Class Wrestling'' which included a bloody cage match between Abdullah and his famous rival Bruiser Brody.\n\nThe 2007, WWC's anniversary show was dedicated to Abdullah the Butcher's contributions to WWC.\n\nOn April 2, 2011, Abdullah the Butcher was inducted into the [[WWE Hall of Fame]] in Atlanta, Georgia. In early 2012, Abdullah the Butcher appeared on the ''Wrestling Marks of Excellence'' radio show and said that he had given away his Hall of Fame ring to his brother, saying that he had been in the business and drew people from all over the world and should have been inducted decades ago.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wrestlezone.com/news/249119-wwe-hall-of-famer-gave-away-ring-jr-confirms-raw-status|title=WWE Hall Of Famer Gave Away Ring, JR Confirms RAW Status \u2013 Wrestlezone|date=February 3, 2012|publisher=}}</ref>\n\nFollowing his WWE Hall of Fame induction, [[Superstar Billy Graham]] requested his name be removed from the Hall, saying: \"It is a shameless organization to induct a bloodthirsty animal such as Abdullah the Butcher into their worthless and embarrassing Hall of Fame and I want the name of Superstar Billy Graham to be no part of it.\"<ref name=spit>{{Cite web|url=http://slam.canoe.ca/Slam/Wrestling/2011/04/08/17929556.html|title= Superstar Graham would spit on Jericho's grave, wants out of WWE HOF |accessdate=September 3, 2014|publisher=Canadian Online Explorer|work=SLAM!

He has a reputation for being involved in some of the most violent and bloody [[hardcore wrestling]] matches of all time.\n\nOne of Shreve's trademarks is a series of divot-like scars on his head that he has due to excessive use of [[Blading (professional wrestling)|blading]] during his career. The scars are so deep that, according to [[Mick Foley]], Shreve is able to put gambling chips into them. An amateur martial artist, Shreve also has knowledge of [[judo]] and [[karate]], often including this knowledge in his wrestling matches. This knowledge was mainly displayed by him using judo throws and Canadian chops.\n\n==Early life==\nShreve was born on January 11, 1941<ref name=\"wrestlingdata.com\"/><ref name=\"wrestlingmuseum.com\">{{cite web|url=http://www.wrestlingmuseum.com/pages/wrestlers/abdullah2.html|title=Professional Wrestling Online Museum \u2013 Abdullah the Butcher|website=www.wrestlingmuseum.com}}</ref><ref name=\"Madman\"/> and raised in [[Windsor, Ontario]], as part of a family of ten people in a deeply impoverished household.<ref name=\"Madman\">{{Cite web|url=http://slam.canoe.ca/Slam/Wrestling/2003/10/31/242993.html |title=Man or Madman? Abdullah in Hull| accessdate=July 18, 2008|publisher=slam.canoe.ca}}</ref> He learned [[karate]] and [[judo]] as a youth and, teaching fellow children in the backyard, claims to have eventually earned the title of seventh-degree grandmaster.<ref name=\"Madman\" />\n\n==Professional wrestling career==\nShreve caught the attention of [[Montreal]] promoter Jack Britton,<ref name=\"Madman\" /> and he soon made his professional wrestling debut at age 17 in 1958. He initially competed in numerous independent territories in Canada under such various monikers as '''Pussycat Pickens''', '''Kuroi Jujutsushi''' (The Black Wizard) and '''Zelis Amara'''. However, he ultimately created his gimmick of an evil [[Arabian]] sadist; and in a match against [[Gino Brito]]<ref name=\"Madman\" /> (Jack Britton's real-life son), the '''Abdullah the Butcher''' character first distinguished himself as one of the world's most feared rule breakers when he broke a chair over Brito's head and then beat him senseless with the leg.\n\nSince his gimmick required that he speak no English (though it was in actuality his native tongue), he possessed a number of managers over the course of his long career, including [[Gary Hart (wrestler)|Gary Hart]], [[Paul Jones (wrestler)|Paul Jones]], [[Eddie Creatchman]], Black Baron, [[Ernie Roth|The Grand Wizard]], [[James J. Dillon|J.J. Dillon]], [[Damien Kane]], [[Larry Sharpe (wrestler)|Larry Sharpe]], [[Hugo Savinovich]], [[Chicky Starr]], [[Oliver Humperdink]], Buddy Colt, George Cannon, [[Bearcat Wright]], Big Bad John, [[Tony Montana (Director)|Tony Montana]], Gentleman Jim Holiday, and Rock Hunter, who were all portrayed as \"handlers\" commissioned to control the Sudanese madman, while also doing most of the talking in promos and interviews. He has, however, spoken for himself in promos while in Japan.\n\n[[File:AbdullahTheButcher.jpg|thumb|left|Abdullah the Butcher in a match in 2004]]\nAs a result of his frequent traveling, Abdullah the Butcher usually served as more of a special attraction than as a consistent championship contender. Accordingly, Abdullah never did win a world heavyweight championship, though he would capture several regional titles during his career. He won his first major championship on October 23, 1967, when he teamed with Dr. Jerry Graham to defeat [[John Tolos|John]] & Carlos Tolos for the [[National Wrestling Alliance|NWA]]'s [[NWA Canadian Tag Team Championship (Vancouver version)|Canadian Tag Team Titles in Vancouver]]. A few years later, he ventured to the Montreal region, where he had three reigns as the IWA International Heavyweight Champion between 1969 and 1972, feuding against [[Ivan Koloff]] and [[Johnny Rougeau]]. He later served as one of the premier rule breakers in [[Stampede Wrestling|Calgary's Stampede]] territory, capturing the NWA Canadian Championship, as well as having six North American Heavyweight Title reigns during the early 1970s. On June 24, 1972, he defeated Ernie Ladd in Akron, Ohio, to capture his first of two [[NWF Heavyweight Championship]]s. In 1972, he wrestled a few matches for [[World Wide Wrestling Federation]]. Also he worked for [[Stampede Wrestling]] from 1970 to 1974. During the mid-1970s, he frequently performed in [[Detroit, Michigan]]'s Big-Time Wrestling territory, where he engaged in a rivalry against [[Ed Farhat|The Sheik]]. He teamed with \"Killer\" Tim Brooks to win the region's version of the NWA World Tag Team Titles before defeating Bobo Brazil on February 8, 1975, for the NWA United States Championship.\n\nIn addition to his successes in North America, Abdullah the Butcher also performed in the [[Far East]], [[Europe]], the [[Caribbean]], [[Australia]], and [[Africa]]. On March 12, 1974, he traveled all the way to [[New Zealand]], where he captured the British Empire Commonwealth Title by defeating the nation's champion [[John DaSilva]]. Abdullah also established himself as one of the premier attractions in [[Japan]], where he competed as part of the round-robin tournament that ultimately crowned [[Shohei Baba|Giant Baba]] as All-Japan's inaugural PWF Heavyweight Champion in February 1973. On October 18, 1978, Abdullah won that same PWF belt when he defeated European former AWA champion Billy Robinson; and then on October 13, 1980, he also beat [[Jumbo Tsuruta]] to capture the NWA United National Heavyweight Title. He also feuded with [[Terry Funk]] in [[Japan]], and Funk claims to have had one of his top three all-time greatest matches with Abdullah the Butcher.\n\nHe arrived in [[World Class Championship Wrestling]] (WCCW) in 1986, where he defeated [[Great Kabuki|The Great Kabuki]] for the Texas Brass Knuckles Title and waged war against the equally wild [[Bruiser Brody]]. In Puerto Rico, he was declared the very first WWC Universal Heavyweight Champion in July 1982 following three reigns as the Puerto Rican champion between 1978 and 1981.\n\nHe was introduced in [[World Championship Wrestling]] in a giant, gift-wrapped box.<ref name=\"mf202\">{{cite book | author = Mick Foley | title = Have A Nice Day: A Tale of Blood and Sweatsocks | publisher = HarperCollins | year = 2000 | isbn = 0-06-103101-1 | page = 202}}</ref> This giant box was to be Sting's birthday gift from [[Mick Foley|Cactus Jack]].<ref name=\"mf202\"/> Sting unwrapped his gift and Abdullah attacked him, leading to both Abdullah and Cactus feuding with Sting after the incident. The feud culminated in a \"Chamber of Horrors\" match at [[Halloween Havoc (1991)|Halloween Havoc 1991]], in which Cactus accidentally electrocuted Abdullah in an [[electric chair]], leading to a brief [[Feud (professional wrestling)|feud]] between the former allies. \n\nIn 1993, Abdullah arrived in [[Extreme Championship Wrestling|ECW]], where he participated in a storyline with Kevin Sullivan, Terry Funk and Stan Hansen, and wrestled at Ultra Clash and Bloodfest.\n\nIn October 1999, Abdullah took part in the ill-fated [[Heroes of Wrestling]] pay-per-view with a match against the [[One Man Gang]]. The match ended in a double count-out.\n\nIn late 2002, Abdullah made a one-night appearance in [[Ring of Honor]] as Homicide's partner, facing the Carnage Crew in a bloody [[Bunkhouse Brawl]] at ROH's Night of the Butcher.\n\nOn December 13, 2008, Shreve wrestled against [[Balls Mahoney]] in Bayamon Puerto Rico during the annual event WWC Lockout.\n\nDuring July 2009, he wrestled in [[Dragon Gate (wrestling)|Dragon Gate]] and [[Hustle (professional wrestling)|Hustle]]. He also wrestled at the [[New Japan Pro-Wrestling]] supershow [[Wrestle Kingdom IV in Tokyo Dome]] on January 4, 2010, as well as wrestling for Japanese independent promotion Osaka Pro Wrestling.\n\nIn 2009, Abdullah made an appearance at the Decatur Book Festival, facing off against author [[Michael Muhammad Knight]]. Abdullah pummeled Knight with chairs, forks, and a water cooler, not even stepping into the ring. Knight was taken from the festival in an ambulance and received 46 stitches. It was Right After Wrestling in March 2011, hosted by [[Arda Ocal]] and [[Jimmy Korderas]], that Abdullah admitted his favorite wrestler to face was actually [[Lou Thesz]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://radio.thescore.com/episodes/abdullah-the-butcher-raw-feb-28-2011 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=March 22, 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120717002804/http://radio.thescore.com/episodes/abdullah-the-butcher-raw-feb-28-2011 |archivedate=July 17, 2012 }}</ref>\n\nHis last match was on October 9, 2010 in a draw against [[Bull Buchanan]] at GCW Southern Legends Fan Fest.\n\nAlso in 2011, Abdullah returned to [[Georgia Championship Wrestling]] as a mentor and adviser to a local wrestler known as The Congo Warrior.\n\nOn October 20, 2018, it was announced that Abdullah will have his retirement ceremony during the Giant Baba 20th Anniversary Memorial Show on February 19, 2019 at Sumo Hall in Tokyo.\n\n==Legacy==\nThroughout his career, many [[video game]]s have included depictions of Abdullah the Butcher, either as playable characters or as enemies. Some of these, such as ''[[Legends of Wrestling II]]'', have included his name and direct likeness, whereas others such as ''[[HammerLock Wrestling]]'' and ''Appoooh'' include original characters inspired by Abdullah.\n\nCharacters in Japanese anime or manga are also frequently designed to resemble Abdullah the Butcher, often with his signature scars. Examples include Abdullah from ''[[Kinnikuman]]'', Abdullah the Criminal from ''[[One Piece]]'', and Mr. Heart from ''[[Fist of the North Star]]''.\n\n[[File:Abdullah the butcher.jpg|thumb|right|Abdullah the Butcher at his WWE Hall of Fame induction in 2011]]In 2007, the [[WWE]] and [[Jakks Pacific]] released an Abdullah the Butcher \"WWE Classic Superstars\" figure complete with the blade marks on top of his head. A DVD was also released named ''The Triumph and Tragedy of World Class Wrestling'' which included a bloody cage match between Abdullah and his famous rival Bruiser Brody.\n\nThe 2007, WWC's anniversary show was dedicated to Abdullah the Butcher's contributions to WWC.\n\nOn April 2, 2011, Abdullah the Butcher was inducted into the [[WWE Hall of Fame]] in Atlanta, Georgia. In early 2012, Abdullah the Butcher appeared on the ''Wrestling Marks of Excellence'' radio show and said that he had given away his Hall of Fame ring to his brother, saying that he had been in the business and drew people from all over the world and should have been inducted decades ago.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wrestlezone.com/news/249119-wwe-hall-of-famer-gave-away-ring-jr-confirms-raw-status|title=WWE Hall Of Famer Gave Away Ring, JR Confirms RAW Status \u2013 Wrestlezone|date=February 3, 2012|publisher=}}</ref>\n\nFollowing his WWE Hall of Fame induction, [[Superstar Billy Graham]] requested his name be removed from the Hall, saying: \"It is a shameless organization to induct a bloodthirsty animal such as Abdullah the Butcher into their worthless and embarrassing Hall of Fame and I want the name of Superstar Billy Graham to be no part of it.\"<ref name=spit>{{Cite web|url=http://slam.canoe.ca/Slam/Wrestling/2011/04/08/17929556.html|title= Superstar Graham would spit on Jericho's grave, wants out of WWE HOF |accessdate=September 3, 2014|publisher=Canadian Online Explorer|work=SLAM!

Membership was expanded to [[Ivy League]] universities, [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology|MIT]], and [[List of colleges and universities in metropolitan Boston|higher education institutions in the Boston area]], then various other universities, and lastly high school students. Since 2006, anyone who claims to be at least 13 years old has been allowed to become a registered user of Facebook, though this may vary depending on local laws. The name comes from the [[face book]] directories often given to American university students.\n\nThe Facebook service can be accessed from devices with [[Internet]] connectivity, such as [[personal computer]]s, [[tablet computer|tablets]] and [[smartphone]]s. After registering, users can create a profile revealing information about themselves. They can post text, photos and multimedia which is shared with any other users that have agreed to be their [[Friending and following|\"friend\"]], or, with a different privacy setting, with any reader. Users can also use various embedded apps, join common-interest groups, buy and sell items or services on Marketplace, and receive notifications of their Facebook friends' activities and activities of Facebook pages they follow.

According to an interview in 2012 with Chuck Rossi, a build engineer at Facebook, Facebook compiles into a 1.5&nbsp;GB binary blob which is then distributed to the servers using a custom [[BitTorrent]]-based release system. Rossi stated that it takes about 15 minutes to build and 15 minutes to release to the servers. The build and release process has zero downtime. Changes to Facebook are rolled out daily.<ref name=\"Ars Technica BTS\" />\n\nFacebook used a combination platform based on [[HBase]] to store data across distributed machines. Using a tailing architecture, events are stored in log files, and the logs are tailed. The system rolls these events up and writes them to storage. The user interface then pulls the data out and displays it to users. Facebook handles requests as [[Ajax (programming)|AJAX]] behavior. These requests are written to a log file using [[Scribe (log server)|Scribe]] (developed by Facebook).<ref name=\"high scalability\">{{cite web|url=http://highscalability.com/blog/2011/3/22/facebooks-new-realtime-analytics-system-hbase-to-process-20.html|title=Facebook's New Real-time Analytics System: HBase To Process 20 Billion Events Per Day|publisher=Highscalability.com|date=March 22, 2011|accessdate=December 26, 2012}}</ref>\n\nData is read from these log files using Ptail, an internally built tool to aggregate data from multiple Scribe stores. It tails the log files and pulls data out. Ptail data are separated into three streams and sent to clusters in different [[data center]]s (Plugin impression, News feed impressions, Actions (plugin + news feed)). Puma is used to manage periods of high data flow (Input/Output or IO). Data is processed in batches to lessen the number of times needed to read and write under high demand periods (A hot article generates many impressions and news feed impressions that cause huge data skews). Batches are taken every 1.5 seconds, limited by memory used when creating a [[hash table]].<ref name=\"high scalability\" />\n\nData is then output in PHP format. The backend is written in [[Java (programming language)|Java]]. Thrift is used as the messaging format so PHP programs can query Java services. Caching solutions display pages more quickly. The data is then sent to [[MapReduce]] servers where it is queried via Hive. This serves as a backup as the data can be recovered from Hive.<ref name=\"high scalability\" />\n\n====Hack====\nOn March 20, 2014, Facebook announced a new open-source programming language called [[Hack (programming language)|Hack]].

Membership was expanded to [[Ivy League]] universities, [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology|MIT]], and [[List of colleges and universities in metropolitan Boston|higher education institutions in the Boston area]], then various other universities, and lastly high school students. Since 2006, anyone who claims to be at least 13 years old has been allowed to become a registered user of Facebook, though this may vary depending on local laws.

According to an interview in 2012 with Chuck Rossi, a build engineer at Facebook, Facebook compiles into a 1.5&nbsp;GB binary blob which is then distributed to the servers using a custom [[BitTorrent]]-based release system. Rossi stated that it takes about 15 minutes to build and 15 minutes to release to the servers. The build and release process has zero downtime. Changes to Facebook are rolled out daily.<ref name=\"Ars Technica BTS\" />\n\nFacebook used a combination platform based on [[HBase]] to store data across distributed machines. Using a tailing architecture, events are stored in log files, and the logs are tailed. The system rolls these events up and writes them to storage. The user interface then pulls the data out and displays it to users. Facebook handles requests as [[Ajax (programming)|AJAX]] behavior. These requests are written to a log file using [[Scribe (log server)|Scribe]] (developed by Facebook).<ref name=\"high scalability\">{{cite web|url=http://highscalability.com/blog/2011/3/22/facebooks-new-realtime-analytics-system-hbase-to-process-20.html|title=Facebook's New Real-time Analytics System: HBase To Process 20 Billion Events Per Day|publisher=Highscalability.com|date=March 22, 2011|accessdate=December 26, 2012}}</ref>\n\nData is read from these log files using Ptail, an internally built tool to aggregate data from multiple Scribe stores. It tails the log files and pulls data out. Ptail data are separated into three streams and sent to clusters in different [[data center]]s (Plugin impression, News feed impressions, Actions (plugin + news feed)). Puma is used to manage periods of high data flow (Input/Output or IO). Data is processed in batches to lessen the number of times needed to read and write under high demand periods (A hot article generates many impressions and news feed impressions that cause huge data skews). Batches are taken every 1.5 seconds, limited by memory used when creating a [[hash table]].<ref name=\"high scalability\" />\n\nData is then output in PHP format. The backend is written in [[Java (programming language)|Java]]. Thrift is used as the messaging format so PHP programs can query Java services. Caching solutions display pages more quickly. The data is then sent to [[MapReduce]] servers where it is queried via Hive. This serves as a backup as the data can be recovered from Hive.<ref name=\"high scalability\" />\n\n====Hack====\nOn March 20, 2014, Facebook announced a new open-source programming language called [[Hack (programming language)|Hack]].

The [[2019\u201320 coronavirus pandemic]] has caused a decline in the number and scale of the protests with most protest related activities happening online especially on games like [[Animal Crossing]].<ref name=\"8dRLE\" /><ref name=\"VdfFn\" /> Resulting in sail of Animal Crossing stopping in [[Censorship in China|China]].<ref name=\"WG4Ik\" />\n\n== Events ==\n=== 8 April ===\nProtesters mourned the death of Zhou Zile, who passed away 5 mouths ago. A large number of riot police were on patrol at [[Tseung Kwan O station|Tseung Kwan O Station]] and the parking lot of Shangde Village at 5 pm, and observed and photographed the ground conditions at the upper level of the parking lot. Under the \"Limitation Order\", only a small number of citizens lay flowers outside the Suntech parking lot. Some citizens were dissatisfied and asked to leave by police officers.<ref name=\"s5GV2\" />\n\n=== 9 April ===\nThe [[Court of Appeal (Hong Kong)|Court of Appeal]] ruled that the [[Government of Hong Kong|Hong Kong government]]\u2019s use of the [[Emergency Regulations Ordinance]] to formulate the [[Prohibition on Face Covering Regulation]] was constitutional. Part of the government\u2019s appeal was justified, and the Prohibition on Face Covering Regulation was effective when protesters assembled illegally or without approval. The two provisions of \"Prohibition of masking during legal processions and meetings\" and \"Police officers have the right to require persons in public places to remove masked items\" remain unconstitutional. The Court of Appeal said that whether it is illegal assembly or unauthorised assembly, it is also necessary to deter people from wearing masked items and impede the proper implementation of the provisions of the [[Public Order Ordinance]]. Under such circumstances, the Prohibition on Face Covering Regulation is constitutionally valid. However, it is unconstitutional to use the Prohibition on Face Covering Regulation in the procession and assembly of the \"No Objection Notice\" issued by the police.<ref name=\"QO0Nd\" /><ref name=\"p4jsS\" />\n\n=== 15 April ===\nThe [[Tuen Mun]] [[Magistrates' Court (Hong Kong)|Magistrates\u2019 Courts]] sentenced a 21-year-old male barista, who burned and trampled on the flag outside the Tuen Mun Town Hall during a confrontation in Tuen Mun on September 21, 2019, to 240-hour social service order.<ref name=\"PbX7X\" />\n\n=== 18 April ===\n[[Hong Kong Police Force|Hong Kong police]] arrested 15 [[Pro-democracy camp (Hong Kong)|Democrats]] in the morning of 18 April. Most being current or former [[Legislative Council of Hong Kong|legislator]] where charged with participating in an unlawful assembly. With them taking part in demonstrations last year.<ref name=\"pEeMk\" />\n\nFrom 2 p.m, about 30 protesters went outside the Changsha Bay Police Station to support the arrested politicians. During the protest police officers in the police station spoke to the protesters three times alleging that protesters at the scene were involved in violation of the \"restriction order\" and demanded them to disperse. By 4 pm Fu Zhenzhong, the founder of the Hong Kong Defence Movement, and several pro-police protesters were on the scene against the pro-democracy protesters who where holing a sit-in protest.<ref name=\"adrM2\" />\n\nThe arrests attracted the attention of the [[Government of the United Kingdom|British]] and [[Federal government of the United States|American]] governments and several international human rights organisations and the [[News|media]]. A total of 5 organisations including the [[International Bar Association]], the [[Law Society of England and Wales]] and the [[International Commission of Jurists]] issued a statement concerned about the arrest of 15 Democrats and believed that the arrests reflected the continued impact of Hong Kong\u2019s [[Freedom of speech|freedom of expression]] and right to protest.<ref name=\"myvXf\" /> Former [[Governor of Hong Kong]] [[Chris Patten]] criticised this as not the rule of law, but the actions of an [[authoritarian government]].<ref name=\"GsfFN\" /> [[United States Secretary of State|U.S. Secretary of State]] [[Mike Pompeo]] issued a statement condemning the arrest, which is not in accordance with the rule of law mentioned in the [[Sino-British Joint Declaration]]. The [[Speaker of the United States House of Representatives]] [[Nancy Pelosi]] said on [[Twitter]] that Hong Kong\u2019s democracy and [[human rights]] continue to be violated, urging the White House to implement the [[Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act]]. <ref name=\"u84Gr\" /> On April 23, more than 30 members of the [[European Parliament]] issued two co-signed open letters condemning the political prosecution of Hong Kong democrats by the Hong Kong government.<ref name=\"05WCv\" />\n\nA government spokesman pointed out that the relevant cases have entered the [[judicial process]] and no one should make comments about unfounded speculations.<ref name=\"RBwJ3\" /> A spokesperson form the Office of the Commissioner of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the People's Republic of China in the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region said that he expressed strong dissatisfaction and firm opposition to the [[European Parliament]]\u2019s criticism, referring to the open letter as \u201chypocrisy and arrogance on the issue of Hong Kong\".<ref name=\"JdLRQ\" />\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+List of those arrested\n!Political Party\n!Name\n!Previous / Current Public Office\n|-\n|[[Democratic Party (Hong Kong)|Democratic Party]]\n|[[Martin Lee]]\n|Former legislator\n|-\n|Democratic Party\n|[[Albert Ho]]\n|Former legislator\n|-\n|Democratic Party\n|[[Yeung Sum]]\n|Former legislator\n|-\n|Democratic Party\n|[[Sin Chung-kai]]\n|Current [[Kwai Tsing District Council]] Chairman\n|-\n|Democratic Party\n|[[Richard Tsoi]]\n|\n|-\n|[[League of Social Democrats]]\n|[[Leung Kwok-hung]]\n|Former legislator\n|-\n|League of Social Democrats\n|[[Raphael Wong]]\n|\n|-\n|League of Social Democrats\n|[[Avery Ng]]\n|\n|-\n|[[Labour Party]]\n|[[Lee Cheuk-yan]]\n|Former legislator\n|-\n|Labour Party\n|[[Cyd Ho]]\n|Former legislator\n|-\n|[[Civic Party]]\n|[[Margaret Ng]]\n|Former legislator\n|-\n|[[Neighbourhood and Worker's Service Centre]]\n|[[Leung Yiu-chung]]\n|Current legislator\n|-\n|[[Independent politician|Independent]]\n|[[Au Nok-hin]]\n|Former legislator\n|-\n|Independent\n|[[Jimmy Lai]]\n|Founder of [[Next Digital]]\n|-\n|Independent\n|Chen Haohuan\n|\n|}\n\n=== 19 April ===\nThe daughter and friends of an over 50 year old woman with asthma who, since October 2019, has been to the [[Chinese University of Hong Kong conflict|demonstrating at the Chinese University of Hong Kong]] to protect the younger protesters inhaled tear gas and was admitted to hospital due to [[Shortness of breath|dyspnea]] but she eventually died at home on 2 December, 2019 due to dyspnea. The two questioned the harmfulness of [[tear gas]] and led to the death of the mother, and asked the police to disclose the composition of the tear gas.<ref name=\"WycLh\" />\n\n=== 21 April ===\nAt 8 pm, more than 20 protesters sat in the atrium of [[Yoho Mall]] and chanted slogans. At nearly 10 pm, a large number of riot police officers suddenly rushed onto the footbridge of [[Castle Peak Road]], intercepting a number of citizens passing by. Some riot police officers ordered to two citizens to leave, then [[Pepper spray|pepper sprayed]] them. At nearly 11pm, riot police raised a blue flag warning at Youxin Street and intercepted 6 people at Fucai Street . A fixed penalty order was issued with a \"restriction order\".

They repeatedly chanted \"[[Glory to Hong Kong|Glory to Hong Kong, Revolution of the Times]]\", \"Five Demands, Not One Less\". Affected by the \"Position Restriction Order\", the participants kept a distance and placed banners on the ground. At about 2 pm, the protest dispersed peacefully. There are police officers stationed at the overpasses at the exits of the mall and at the entrance of the [[Exchange Square (Hong Kong)|Exchange Square]].<ref name=\"ZJBd5\" />\n\n==== Man sentenced to 20 days in prison for humiliating a flag ====\nA young man trampled on the national [[Flag of China|flag of the People\u2019s Republic of China]] in a pro-democracy protest in 2019. After pleading guilty, he was initially sentenced to a 200-hour social service order. The [[Government of Hong Kong|Hong Kong government]] appealed to the [[Court of Appeal (Hong Kong)|Court of Appeal]] changed the sentence to 20 days in [[prison]].<ref name=\"zYXnW\" />\n\n=== 26 April ===\nAt 6:20 in the evening, about 300 protesters participated in a \"sing with you\" activity on multiple floors of the [[Cityplaza]]. Many protesters chanted slogans and waved flags. The police dispatched a large number of police. Officers and police cars where on patrol. By about 6:40, Eastern Commander Wei Zhida, together with a large number of riot police officers holding shields and [[pepper spray]], entered the mall from different locations to disperse the protesters, accusing them of violating the \"restriction order\". The police asks people in the mall to leave one by one.<ref name=\"57VaF\" /> At about 7 o'clock in the evening, the riot police with anti-riot guns entered the second floor of the mall from the underground. The scene was chaotic. During the period, a police officer pointed at reporter with pepper spray. Police officers later pulled up the cordon and some people were stopped and searched outside the mall. At about 8:00, the mall issued a broadcast indicating that it was about to close.<ref name=\"91Orr\" />\n\nSome protesters stayed on nearby roads. The police used a loudspeaker to read the \"Polymerism Restriction Order\", raised a blue flag warning at Yan Palace Pavilion, and began to disperse the crowed. Police surrounded District Councillor [[Andrew Chiu]] and his assistant. The assistant was violently pushed down to the ground by several riot police officers. Afterwards, he could only blink and became unconscious. Police had allowed first-aiders to enter the scene after a delay of 5 minutes. Andrew Chiu strongly condemned and regretted the police's actions and believed that the actions in [[Cityplaza]] were unexplainable and suppressed. The police subdued a man outside the Yan Palace Pavilion, then passed out and was sent to the hospital for treatment. <ref name=\"iv0HV\" />\n\nThe police issued a press release saying that any person attending a public event who has a common purpose of gathering is a group gathering, and more than 4 people participate, and all participants are illegal. Emphasise that we will never tolerate any illegal behaviour.<ref name=\"f2zca\" />\n\n=== 28 April ===\nAt about 6pm, dozens of protesters participated in the \"sing with you\" activity in the atrium of the International Financial Center Mall in [[Central, Hong Kong|Central]]. They repeatedly chanted the slogan \"[[Glory to Hong Kong]]\". Before the event, at least 14 police cars were parked in the General Post Office, outside the [[Hong Kong station|Hong Kong Station MTR]] and the [[Exchange Square (Hong Kong)|Exchange Square]] bus station, and a large number of uniformed police officers were on patrol at the entrances of the shopping malls. By 6:30, two groups of police officers entered multiple floors of the mall and set up a blockade line in the atrium to drive away the citizens and reporter. The police used a megaphone to say that the restraining order was in effect, and warned the public not to gather in the shopping mall, as many shops closed their doors. Another group of police officers stopped several citizens outside the atrium and shops, and issued fixed penalty notices. Liu Dingcheng, a Hong Kong businessman at the scene, criticised the police for not giving a time limit for the public to leave, nor for warning. He believed that the police officers were unreasonable and would not pay a fine. Some people just after work think that the police abuse the \"restriction order\" to charge the public.<ref name=\"VJ3ss\" />\n\nAt about 7 pm, [[Hui Chi-fung]] ,a member of the [[Legislative Council of Hong Kong|Legislative Council]], was present and asked police officers not to enter the mall to disturb the public. Thinking that the police officers would make the scene more chaotic and stop more people gathering. Later, [[Central, Hong Kong|Central]] and [[Sai Wan|Western District]] Councillors, [[Sam Yip]], Huang Yongzhi and Ren Jiaer were also present. Police officers briefly left the IFC mall, during which citizens dressed as [[North Korea|North Korean]] leader [[Kim Jong-un|Kim Jong Un]] appeared. By about 7:30 in the evening, nearly 200 uniformed police officers entered into the mall again to intercept many protesters, causing dissatisfaction among the citizens present, and some protester stayed in the mall to sing and chant slogans. The police left the mall at 9 pm and went to the B1 exit of Hong Kong Station to intercept the public. Seven young people who returned to the city from [[Cheung Chau]] said they were intercepted when entering the mall. They were brought to the station to register their [[Identity document|ID cards]] before they were released.<ref name=\"ZprkK\" />\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist|refs=\n<ref name=\"8dRLE\">{{Cite

The two provisions of \"Prohibition of masking during legal processions and meetings\" and \"Police officers have the right to require persons in public places to remove masked items\" remain unconstitutional. The Court of Appeal said that whether it is illegal assembly or unauthorised assembly, it is also necessary to deter people from wearing masked items and impede the proper implementation of the provisions of the [[Public Order Ordinance]]. Under such circumstances, the Prohibition on Face Covering Regulation is constitutionally valid. However, it is unconstitutional to use the Prohibition on Face Covering Regulation in the procession and assembly of the \"No Objection Notice\" issued by the police.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://news.tvb.com/local/5e8f006f34b031e87cdd6f84/\u9ad8\u9662\u88c1\u5b9a\u7981\u8499\u9762\u6cd5\u7121\u9055\u61b2-\u975e\u6cd5\u96c6\u7d50\u6216\u672a\u7d93\u6279\u51c6\u96c6\u7d50\u6642\u6709\u6548|title=\u7121\u7dab\u65b0\u805e - \u6e2f\u6fb3 - \u9ad8\u9662\u88c1\u5b9a\u300a\u7981\u8499\u9762\u6cd5\u300b\u7121\u9055\u61b2 \u975e\u6cd5\u96c6\u7d50\u6216\u672a\u7d93\u6279\u51c6\u96c6\u7d50\u6642\u6709\u6548|last=|date=|website=news.tvb.com|publisher=|language=|format=|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200409134722/http://news.tvb.com/local/5e8f006f34b031e87cdd6f84/%25E9%25AB%2598%25E9%2599%25A2%25E8%25A3%2581%25E5%25AE%259A%25E7%25A6%2581%25E8%2592%2599%25E9%259D%25A2%25E6%25B3%2595%25E7%2584%25A1%25E9%2581%2595%25E6%2586%25B2-%25E9%259D%259E%25E6%25B3%2595%25E9%259B%2586%25E7%25B5%2590%25E6%2588%2596%25E6%259C%25AA%25E7%25B6%2593%25E6%2589%25B9%25E5%2587%2586%25E9%259B%2586%25E7%25B5%2590%25E6%2599%2582%25E6%259C%2589%25E6%2595%2588|archive-date=2020-04-09|access-date=2020-04-09}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.voachinese.com/a/hong-kong-mask-ban-legal-when-aimed-at-unauthorised-demonstrations-appeal-court-rule-/5365724.html|title=\u6e2f\u9ad8\u9662\u4e0a\u8bc9\u88c1\u51b3\uff1a\u6e2f\u5e9c\u7d27\u6025\u7acb\u6cd5\u5408\u5baa\uff0c\u5408\u6cd5\u96c6\u4f1a\u7981\u8499\u9762\u6cd5\u8fdd\u5baa|website=\u7f8e\u56fd\u4e4b\u97f3|language=zh|access-date=2020-04-09}}</ref>\n\n=== 15 April ===\nThe [[Tuen Mun]] [[Magistrates' Court (Hong Kong)|Magistrates\u2019 Courts]] sentenced a 21-year-old male barista, who burned and trampled on the flag outside the Tuen Mun Town Hall during a confrontation in Tuen Mun on September 21, 2019, to 240-hour social service order.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://news.mingpao.com/pns/%E6%B8%AF%E8%81%9E/article/20200416/s00002/1586976520249/%E5%92%96%E5%95%A1%E5%B8%AB%E7%87%92%E5%9C%8B%E6%97%97%E5%88%A4%E7%A4%BE%E6%9C%8D%E4%BB%A4|title=\u5496\u5561\u5e2b\u71d2\u570b\u65d7\u5224\u793e\u670d\u4ee4|agency=\u660e\u5831}}</ref>\n\n=== 18 April ===\n[[Hong Kong Police Force|Hong Kong police]] arrested 15 [[Pro-democracy camp (Hong Kong)|Democrats]] in the morning of 18 April.

They repeatedly chanted the slogan \"[[Glory to Hong Kong]]\". Before the event, at least 14 police cars were parked in the General Post Office, outside the [[Hong Kong station|Hong Kong Station MTR]] and the [[Exchange Square (Hong Kong)|Exchange Square]] bus station, and a large number of uniformed police officers were on patrol at the entrances of the shopping malls. By 6:30, two groups of police officers entered multiple floors of the mall and set up a blockade line in the atrium to drive away the citizens and reporter. The police used a megaphone to say that the restraining order was in effect, and warned the public not to gather in the shopping mall, as many shops closed their doors. Another group of police officers stopped several citizens outside the atrium and shops, and issued fixed penalty notices. Liu Dingcheng, a Hong Kong businessman at the scene, criticised the police for not giving a time limit for the public to leave, nor for warning. He believed that the police officers were unreasonable and would not pay a fine. Some people just after work think that the police abuse the \"restriction order\" to charge the public.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://hk.appledaily.com/local/20200428/JSAFAEBHOE3UGEPPSQQIMM5U6E/|title=\u3010\u6297\u66b4\u4e4b\u6230\u3011\u7db2\u6c11\u865f\u53ecIFC\u56db\u4eba\u4e00\u7d44\u548c\u4f60Sing \u8b66\u518d\u6feb\u7528\u300c\u9650\u805a\u4ee4\u300d\u81f3\u5c116\u4eba\u88ab\u7968\u63a7|date=2020-04-29|work=\u860b\u679c\u65e5\u5831|access-date=2020-04-29}}</ref>\n\nAt about 7 pm, [[Hui Chi-fung]] ,a member of the [[Legislative Council of Hong Kong|Legislative Council]], was present and asked police officers not to enter the mall to disturb the public.

The police left the mall at 9 pm and went to the B1 exit of Hong Kong Station to intercept the public.

In 1959, she became a regular supporting cast member on the CBS-TV variety series ''[[The Garry Moore Show]]''. Departing the Moore Show in the spring of 1962, she pursued other projects in film,  Broadway productions, and headlining her own television specials.  Burnett signed a contract with CBS for 10 years which required her to do two guest appearances and a special a year. Within the first five years of this contract, she had the option to \"push the button\", a phrase the programming executives used,<ref>{{cite book |last= Burnett|first= Carol|date= 2016|title=  In Such Good Company: Eleven Years of Laughter, Mayhem, and Fun in the Sandbox|url= |location= New York City|publisher= Crown Archetype|page= 4|isbn= 978-1101904657|author-link= }}</ref> and be put on the air in 30 one-hour variety shows, [[pay-or-play]]. After discussion with her husband [[Joe Hamilton (producer)|Joe Hamilton]], in the last week of the fifth year of the contract, Burnett decided to call the head of CBS [[Michael Dann]] and exercise the clause. Dann, explaining that variety is a \"man's genre\", offered Burnett a sitcom called ''Here's Agnes''. Burnett had no interest in doing a sitcom, and because of the contract, CBS was obliged to give Burnett her own variety show.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.emmytvlegends.org/interviews/people/carol-burnett#| title=Interview: Carol Burnett| publisher=Archive of American Television| date=29 April 2003| last=Herman| first=Karen}}</ref>\n\n==Production==\n[[File:Carol Burnett show cast 1977.JPG|thumb|230px|On the left, main cast members in 1967 (clockwise from the bottom): Burnett, Harvey Korman, Vicki Lawrence, and Lyle Waggoner, on the right, the 1977 cast: Burnett, Tim Conway, Lawrence, and Korman]]\nIn addition to Carol Burnett, the cast consisted of:\n*[[Vicki Lawrence]]\n*[[Harvey Korman]] (seasons 1\u201310)\n*[[Lyle Waggoner]] (seasons 1\u20137)\n*[[Tim Conway]] (seasons 9\u201311; frequent guest performer in seasons 1\u20138)\n*[[Dick Van Dyke]] (first half of season 11)\nComedic actor Harvey Korman had done many guest shots in TV sitcoms. From 1963 to 1967, he had been a semi-regular on the CBS variety series ''[[The Danny Kaye Show]]''. When Kaye's program ended in the spring of 1967, Korman was immediately hired for ''The Carol Burnett Show''. \n\nAt this particular time, actor Lyle Waggoner had recently auditioned for the title role in the [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] series [[Batman]] but was passed over in favor of [[Adam West]]. Shortly after, Waggoner auditioned for the Burnett show and was immediately hired.  He would sometimes play the handsome man for Burnett to fawn over. His participation on the series was somewhat modeled on [[Durward Kirby]]  of ''The Garry Moore Show'' as Waggoner also functioned as the show's announcer in addition to playing in sketches.\n\n[[File:Carol Burnett Vicki Lawrence Dinah Shore Carol Burnett Show 1977.JPG|thumb|left|Burnett, Vicki Lawrence, and guest star [[Dinah Shore]] in the 1976 ''[[Went with the Wind!]]'' sketch]]\nVicki Lawrence, a young singer from [[The Young Americans]] wrote a letter to Burnett when she was 17, remarking on their physical resemblance. This led to her audition and getting hired to play Burnett's kid sister in numerous \"Carol and Sis\" sketches.\n\n[[Jim Nabors]] was the guest star on every season premiere of the show. Burnett considered Nabors to be her annual good luck charm.\n\nIn addition, several notable actors were used in the comedy sketches in featured roles, especially in the first season, such as [[William Schallert]], [[Isabel Sanford]], and [[Reta Shaw]].\n\nThe popular variety show not only established Burnett as a television superstar, but it also made her regular supporting cast household names, with such sketches as \"[[As the Stomach Turns]]\", (a parody of ''[[As the World Turns]]'') and \"[[Went with the Wind!]]\" (a spoof of ''[[Gone with the Wind (film)|Gone with the Wind]]''), \"Carol & Sis\", \"[[Mrs. Wiggins]]\", and \"[[The Family (sketch)|The Family]]\" (which led to a [[television film|made-for-TV]] movie titled ''[[Eunice (film)|Eunice]]'', as well as a spin-off television series titled ''[[Mama's Family]]''), \"Nora Desmond\" (Burnett's send-up of [[Gloria Swanson]]'s character [[Norma Desmond]] in ''[[Sunset Boulevard (1950 film)|Sunset Boulevard]]''), and \"Stella Toddler\". A frequent repeated segment was \"Kitchen Commercials\", in which cast members parodied TV commercials that drove a woman (Burnett) crazy. The long-running show was frequently nominated for [[Emmy Award|Emmys]] for best variety series and won three times.\n\nA favorite feature consisted of an unrehearsed question-and-answer segment with the audience in CBS Studio 33 (now [[Bob Barker]] Studio) lasting about three to four minutes at the start of most shows. Burnett stated that she borrowed the concept from Garry Moore, who did the same on his variety show, but never taped it.<ref>\"The Florence Henderson Show\" RLTV, 2009</ref> Burnett asked for the lights to be turned up (\"let's bump up the lights\") and then randomly picked audience members who raised their hands. Burnett often ad-libbed funny answers, but occasionally ended up as the straight (wo)man. For example:\n\n:Young woman: \"Have you ever taken acting lessons?\"\n:Carol: \"Yes, I have.\"\n:Young woman: \"Do you think it did any good?\"\n\nThe show was rehearsed each day until its two Friday tapings. Differently colored cue cards (black, blue, green, and red) were used for each major performer (\"Carol Burnett: Bump-Up the Lights\"). The second taping was fairly routine until Tim Conway came aboard as a guest star.\nAs a recurring guest star from the show's launch and later a regular cast member, Conway provided unrehearsed bits to sketches that became known to the staff as \"Conway's Capers\". Conway would play the first taping straight, but (if the sketch had played well in the first taping, and could be used) would ad-lib bizarre scenarios during the second. Some notable clips included Conway as a Nazi interrogator berating an American captive (Lyle Waggoner). Using a Hitler puppet and a pencil as a \"club\", Conway sang three verses of \"[[I've Been Working on the Railroad]]\" as Waggoner tried in vain to ignore him. Some, like the Hitler puppet, made it into the final broadcast; others, like a notably convoluted story about Siamese elephants joined at the trunk (ad-libbed during a 1977 \"Mama's Family\" sketch), were edited, the uncensored version only appearing years later on CBS specials. Conway's favorite victim was Harvey Korman, who often broke character reacting to Conway's zaniness, such as when Conway played a dentist misusing Novocain or the recurring role of [[The Oldest Man (character)|\"The Oldest Man\"]] \u2013 an elderly, shuffling, senile man who slowly rolled down stairways and fell prey to various mechanical mishaps (including an electric wheelchair and an automated dry-cleaning rack).\n\nThe show also became known for its closing theme song, written by Burnett's husband, with these lyrics:<ref>{{cite web| last=Bell| first=Warren| title=Have a Laugh and Sing a Song| url=http://old.nationalreview.com/bell/bell200511090809.asp| accessdate=August 19, 2011| date=November 9, 2009}}{{dead link|date=May 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> \n:I'm so glad we had this time together\n:Just to have a laugh or sing a song\n:Seems we just get started and before you know it\n:Comes the time we have to say, \"So long.\"\n\nAt the close of each episode, Burnett tugged her ear. This silent message was meant for her grandmother, who raised her, and meant she was thinking of her at that moment. After her grandmother's death, Burnett continued the tradition.\n\n==Broadcast==\nWhen ''The Carol Burnett Show'' made its network debut on CBS-TV in September 1967, it was scheduled on Monday nights at 10:00&nbsp;pm opposite NBC\u2019s ''[[I Spy (1965 TV series)|I Spy]]'' and ABC\u2019s ''[[The Big Valley]]''. At the end of its first season and through the spring of 1971, it consistently ranked among the top-30 programs. (For the 1969\u201370 season, it posted its highest rating ever, ranking at number 13.) For season five, CBS moved the show to Wednesday nights at 8:00&nbsp;pm, where its chief competition was NBC\u2019s ''[[Adam-12]]'' and the ABC sitcoms ''[[Bewitched]]'' and ''[[The Courtship of Eddie's Father]]''. Despite the schedule change, the show continued to do well until the fall of 1972, when the ratings slipped. In December 1972, CBS again moved ''The Carol Burnett Show'' to Saturday nights at 10:00&nbsp;pm (EST) where, for the next four years, it not only received solid ratings, but was also part of a powerhouse Saturday-night lineup of primetime shows that included ''[[All in the Family]]'', ''[[M*A*S*H (TV series)|M*A*S*H]]'', ''[[The Mary Tyler Moore Show]]'', and ''[[The Bob Newhart Show]]''.\n\nIn the 1973\u201374 season, the \"Family\" sketches (with Burnett as Eunice, Korman as her husband Ed, and Lawrence as Eunice's mother) were introduced and the \"Carol and Sis\" segments were phased out. At the end of that season (the series' seventh), after having been with ''The Carol Burnett Show'' from the beginning, Lyle Waggoner left the series to pursue other acting opportunities. The following season, Waggoner's spot as a supporting regular remained vacant. Don Crichton, the lead male dancer on the show, began to inherit some of Waggoner's duties. Then in season nine, because of his many popular guest appearances on the series, Tim Conway was signed as a full-time regular, joining Korman and Lawrence.\n\n[[File:Tim Conway Carol Burnett Dick Van Dyke Carol Burnett Show 1977.JPG|thumb|150px|From left to right: Conway, Burnett, and Dick Van Dyke in the final season]]\nIn November, 1976, the series' tenth year, ''The Carol Burnett Show'' presented what would become one of its best-known and most well-regarded sketches: \"[[Went with the Wind!]],\" a parody of the 1939 film ''[[Gone with the Wind (film)|Gone with the Wind]]'', which had its television debut on NBC the week before. After the 1976-77 season ended, Harvey Korman decided to leave the series. After a decade of working with Burnett and winning several Emmy Awards, Korman had been offered a contract by ABC to headline his own series. Also, the ratings had begun to decline. Nevertheless, CBS renewed Burnett's show for an 11th season.\n\nDick Van Dyke, fresh from headlining his own short-lived Emmy-winning variety series, ''Van Dyke & Company'', was brought in to replace Korman. However, his presence did not help stem the sagging ratings, as the show faced new competition in ABC's ''[[The Love Boat]]''. After three months, Van Dyke departed the show, and CBS, in a desperate attempt to save the series, moved ''The Carol Burnett Show'' from Saturday nights at 10:00&nbsp;pm to Sunday nights at the same hour, beginning in December 1977. Regular guest stars [[Steve Lawrence]] and [[Ken Berry]] were brought in to fill the void left by Korman and Van Dyke. The ratings improved considerably.\n\nCBS wanted to renew the show for another year, but by this time, Burnett had grown tired of the weekly grind and wanted to explore acting roles outside of the comedy genre, despite her success in it. With the changes in cast along with the mediocre ratings, she felt that television was undergoing a transition and that the variety series format was on its way out. Therefore, Burnett decided to end the series on her own rather than be canceled later. Thus, on March 29, 1978, in a special two-hour finale entitled \"[[A Special Evening with Carol Burnett]]\", ''The Carol Burnett Show'' left primetime television after 11 years, finishing its last season in 66th place. Reruns were aired during the summer of 1978.\n\n==Notable characters/sketches==\n\n[[File:Carol Burnett charwoman character 1974.JPG|thumb|150px|Burnett as the Charwoman]]\n[[File:Carol Burnett Madeline Kahn Eunice Carol Burnett Show.JPG|thumb|150px|Burnett as Eunice with [[Madeline Kahn]] in \"The Family\" sketch]]\n\n*[[As the Stomach Turns]] \u2013 a [[soap opera]] parody taking place in the fictional town of Canoga Falls with Burnett as the main character Marian.\n*Carol and Sis \u2013 Burnett as Carol and Lawrence as her sister Chris with Korman as Carol's husband Roger;<ref name=\"Emmy Award Winning Nighttime Television Shows, 1948-2004 1\">{{cite book| first= Wesley| last= Hyatt| year= 2006| title= Emmy Award Winning Nighttime Television Shows, 1948-2004| edition=| publisher= McFarland & Company| location=| pages= 239| isbn= 978-0786423293}}</ref> the sketch was based on Burnett's life in New York raising her kid sister in New York with her first husband, and Lawrence was originally hired just for this sketch.<ref name=\"emmytvlegends.org\">{{cite web|url=http://www.emmytvlegends.org/interviews/people/vicki-lawrence#|title=Vicki Lawrence|work=Archive of American Television|accessdate=9 January 2017}}</ref>\n*The Charwoman \u2013 Burnett's signature character, an unnamed [[charwoman]] (most often in a musical number),<ref name=\"Emmy Award Winning Nighttime Television Shows, 1948-2004 2\">{{cite book| first= Wesley| last= Hyatt| year= 2006| title= Emmy Award Winning Nighttime Television Shows, 1948-2004| edition=| publisher= McFarland & Company| location=| pages= 240| isbn= 978-0786423293}}</ref> whose animated image has been used in the opening credits, and also in the opening and closing credits of ''Carol Burnett and Friends''.\n*Chiquita \u2013 Burnett's parody of [[Charo]];

Many of these film parodies were written or co-written by [[Stan Hart]], [[Arnie Kogen]] and [[Larry Siegel]], all prolific contributors for [[Mad (magazine)|''Mad'']] magazine, with each authoring dozens of the magazine's own movie satires.\n\n==After the series==\n\n===Continuations and revivals===\n{{refimprove section|date=July 2018}}\nIn the fall of 1977, while the series was still running in prime time, the comedy sketches of the show were re-edited into freestanding programs; the resulting show enjoyed success for many years in [[television syndication|syndicated]] [[rerun]]s (as ''Carol Burnett and Friends'', a half-hour edition of selected 1972\u201377 material).\n\nIn the spring of 1979, a year after ''The Carol Burnett Show'' left the air, Burnett and her husband Joe Hamilton were dining in a restaurant with friends, including Tim Conway. At that gathering, Burnett got wistful and started reminiscing about the show and making suggestions to Conway concerning sketches that she wished they could be creating if the show were still running. Hamilton suggested to Burnett that she do a summer series. Taking that idea, Burnett and Hamilton approached CBS about doing a four-week program in the summer of 1979. CBS already had its schedule filled for the summer months and rejected the idea. However, ABC was interested, and as a result, four postscript episodes of ''The Carol Burnett Show'' were produced. Under the title ''[[Carol Burnett & Company]]'', the show premiered on Saturday, August 18, 1979, and included many favorite sketches such as \"Mr. Tudball and Mrs. Wiggins\", \"The Family\", \"As The Stomach Turns\", and Burnett doing her impersonation of Queen Elizabeth II. Its format was very much similar to Burnett's series, with two exceptions. Due to the unavailability of Harvey Korman (who, ironically, had been under contract to ABC since he had left Burnett's show in 1977), comic actors [[Kenneth Mars]] and [[Craig Richard Nelson]] were added to the supporting cast, joining Lawrence and Conway. [[Ernie Flatt]], who had been the choreographer on Burnett's show for its entire 11-year run, was replaced by the show's lead dancer Don Crichton. The guest stars in that four-week period were (chronologically) [[Cheryl Ladd]], [[Alan Arkin]], [[Penny Marshall]], and [[Sally Field]]. The reviews of the series were very favorable, with several critics heartily welcoming Burnett back to weekly television, albeit on a limited basis. The ratings also were respectable and plans were announced for the program to become a yearly summer event, but it never happened.\n\nThe \"Family\" sketches led to a 1982 CBS made-for-television film called ''[[Eunice (film)|Eunice]]'' starring Burnett, Korman, Lawrence, Betty White, and Ken Berry. The success of this program spawned a spin-off sitcom titled ''[[Mama's Family]]'', starring Vicki Lawrence and Ken Berry, which ran from 1983 to 1990. It occasionally featured Burnett and Korman guest-starring as Eunice and Ed Higgins; Burnett's involvement in ''Mama's Family'' was limited due to her divorce from producer [[Joe Hamilton (producer)|Joe Hamilton]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://abcnews.go.com/2020/story?id=123891&page=1 |title=Humor Helps Carol Burnett Cope \u2013 ABC News |publisher=Abcnews.go.com |date= |accessdate=2013-03-01}}</ref> In the first year and a half of the show's run, Korman also appeared as narrator Alastair Quince, introducing each episode (a parody of [[Alastair Cooke]] hosting ''[[Masterpiece Theatre]]'') and he also directed 31 episodes of the series.\n\n[[NBC]] aired a comedy half-hour repertory series called ''[[Carol & Company]]'' that premiered in March 1990. It proved to be moderately successful in the ratings and was renewed for a second season. The regulars on the show included [[Peter Krause]], [[Jeremy Piven]], [[Terry Kiser]], [[Meagen Fay]], [[Anita Barone]], and [[Richard Kind]] (and occasional guest stars, including [[Betty White]] and [[Burt Reynolds]]); each week's show was a different half-hour comedy play. This program lasted until July 1991.\n\nCBS brought back ''The Carol Burnett Show'' for another run in the fall of 1991; new regulars included Meagen Fay and Richard Kind (brought over from the NBC show), and [[Chris Barnes (actor)|Chris Barnes]], [[Roger Kabler]], and [[Jessica Lundy]]. However, the times had changed and Burnett's humor was tame compared to the edgier comedy popular in the 1990s. The series failed to catch on with the public and only six episodes of this revival were aired.\n\nIn 1994, reruns of the syndicated ''Carol Burnett and Friends'' package aired on [[Nick at Nite]]. The show also aired on [[History of Freeform (TV channel)#The Family Channel|The Family Channel]] in 1996 and on [[TV Land]] as part of that network's inaugural lineup from 1996 to 1997 and again from 2004 to 2005.

In 1959, she became a regular supporting cast member on the CBS-TV variety series ''[[The Garry Moore Show]]''. Departing the Moore Show in the spring of 1962, she pursued other projects in film,  Broadway productions, and headlining her own television specials.  Burnett signed a contract with CBS for 10 years which required her to do two guest appearances and a special a year. Within the first five years of this contract, she had the option to \"push the button\", a phrase the programming executives used,<ref>{{cite book |last= Burnett|first= Carol|date= 2016|title=  In Such Good Company: Eleven Years of Laughter, Mayhem, and Fun in the Sandbox|url= |location= New York City|publisher= Crown Archetype|page= 4|isbn= 978-1101904657|author-link= }}</ref> and be put on the air in 30 one-hour variety shows, [[pay-or-play]]. After discussion with her husband [[Joe Hamilton (producer)|Joe Hamilton]], in the last week of the fifth year of the contract, Burnett decided to call the head of CBS [[Michael Dann]] and exercise the clause. Dann, explaining that variety is a \"man's genre\", offered Burnett a sitcom called ''Here's Agnes''. Burnett had no interest in doing a sitcom, and because of the contract, CBS was obliged to give Burnett her own variety show.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.emmytvlegends.org/interviews/people/carol-burnett#| title=Interview: Carol Burnett| publisher=Archive of American Television| date=29 April 2003| last=Herman| first=Karen}}</ref>\n\n==Production==\n[[File:Carol Burnett show cast 1977.JPG|thumb|230px|On the left, main cast members in 1967 (clockwise from the bottom): Burnett, Harvey Korman, Vicki Lawrence, and Lyle Waggoner, on the right, the 1977 cast: Burnett, Tim Conway, Lawrence, and Korman]]\nIn addition to Carol Burnett, the cast consisted of:\n*[[Vicki Lawrence]]\n*[[Harvey Korman]] (seasons 1\u201310)\n*[[Lyle Waggoner]] (seasons 1\u20137)\n*[[Tim Conway]] (seasons 9\u201311; frequent guest performer in seasons 1\u20138)\n*[[Dick Van Dyke]] (first half of season 11)\nComedic actor Harvey Korman had done many guest shots in TV sitcoms. From 1963 to 1967, he had been a semi-regular on the CBS variety series ''[[The Danny Kaye Show]]''. When Kaye's program ended in the spring of 1967, Korman was immediately hired for ''The Carol Burnett Show''. \n\nAt this particular time, actor Lyle Waggoner had recently auditioned for the title role in the [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] series [[Batman]] but was passed over in favor of [[Adam West]]. Shortly after, Waggoner auditioned for the Burnett show and was immediately hired.  He would sometimes play the handsome man for Burnett to fawn over. His participation on the series was somewhat modeled on [[Durward Kirby]]  of ''The Garry Moore Show'' as Waggoner also functioned as the show's announcer in addition to playing in sketches.\n\n[[File:Carol Burnett Vicki Lawrence Dinah Shore Carol Burnett Show 1977.JPG|thumb|left|Burnett, Vicki Lawrence, and guest star [[Dinah Shore]] in the 1976 ''[[Went with the Wind!]]'' sketch]]\nVicki Lawrence, a young singer from [[The Young Americans]] wrote a letter to Burnett when she was 17, remarking on their physical resemblance. This led to her audition and getting hired to play Burnett's kid sister in numerous \"Carol and Sis\" sketches.\n\n[[Jim Nabors]] was the guest star on every season premiere of the show. Burnett considered Nabors to be her annual good luck charm.\n\nIn addition, several notable actors were used in the comedy sketches in featured roles, especially in the first season, such as [[William Schallert]], [[Isabel Sanford]], and [[Reta Shaw]].\n\nThe popular variety show not only established Burnett as a television superstar, but it also made her regular supporting cast household names, with such sketches as \"[[As the Stomach Turns]]\", (a parody of ''[[As the World Turns]]'') and \"[[Went with the Wind!]]\" (a spoof of ''[[Gone with the Wind (film)|Gone with the Wind]]''), \"Carol & Sis\", \"[[Mrs. Wiggins]]\", and \"[[The Family (sketch)|The Family]]\" (which led to a [[television film|made-for-TV]] movie titled ''[[Eunice (film)|Eunice]]'', as well as a spin-off television series titled ''[[Mama's Family]]''), \"Nora Desmond\" (Burnett's send-up of [[Gloria Swanson]]'s character [[Norma Desmond]] in ''[[Sunset Boulevard (1950 film)|Sunset Boulevard]]''), and \"Stella Toddler\". A frequent repeated segment was \"Kitchen Commercials\", in which cast members parodied TV commercials that drove a woman (Burnett) crazy. The long-running show was frequently nominated for [[Emmy Award|Emmys]] for best variety series and won three times.\n\nA favorite feature consisted of an unrehearsed question-and-answer segment with the audience in CBS Studio 33 (now [[Bob Barker]] Studio) lasting about three to four minutes at the start of most shows. Burnett stated that she borrowed the concept from Garry Moore, who did the same on his variety show, but never taped it.<ref>\"The Florence Henderson Show\" RLTV, 2009</ref> Burnett asked for the lights to be turned up (\"let's bump up the lights\") and then randomly picked audience members who raised their hands. Burnett often ad-libbed funny answers, but occasionally ended up as the straight (wo)man. For example:\n\n:Young woman: \"Have you ever taken acting lessons?\"\n:Carol: \"Yes, I have.\"\n:Young woman: \"Do you think it did any good?\"\n\nThe show was rehearsed each day until its two Friday tapings. Differently colored cue cards (black, blue, green, and red) were used for each major performer (\"Carol Burnett: Bump-Up the Lights\"). The second taping was fairly routine until Tim Conway came aboard as a guest star.\nAs a recurring guest star from the show's launch and later a regular cast member, Conway provided unrehearsed bits to sketches that became known to the staff as \"Conway's Capers\". Conway would play the first taping straight, but (if the sketch had played well in the first taping, and could be used) would ad-lib bizarre scenarios during the second. Some notable clips included Conway as a Nazi interrogator berating an American captive (Lyle Waggoner). Using a Hitler puppet and a pencil as a \"club\", Conway sang three verses of \"[[I've Been Working on the Railroad]]\" as Waggoner tried in vain to ignore him. Some, like the Hitler puppet, made it into the final broadcast; others, like a notably convoluted story about Siamese elephants joined at the trunk (ad-libbed during a 1977 \"Mama's Family\" sketch), were edited, the uncensored version only appearing years later on CBS specials. Conway's favorite victim was Harvey Korman, who often broke character reacting to Conway's zaniness, such as when Conway played a dentist misusing Novocain or the recurring role of [[The Oldest Man (character)|\"The Oldest Man\"]] \u2013 an elderly, shuffling, senile man who slowly rolled down stairways and fell prey to various mechanical mishaps (including an electric wheelchair and an automated dry-cleaning rack).\n\nThe show also became known for its closing theme song, written by Burnett's husband, with these lyrics:<ref>{{cite web| last=Bell| first=Warren| title=Have a Laugh and Sing a Song| url=http://old.nationalreview.com/bell/bell200511090809.asp| accessdate=August 19, 2011| date=November 9, 2009}}{{dead link|date=May 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> \n:I'm so glad we had this time together\n:Just to have a laugh or sing a song\n:Seems we just get started and before you know it\n:Comes the time we have to say, \"So long.\"\n\nAt the close of each episode, Burnett tugged her ear. This silent message was meant for her grandmother, who raised her, and meant she was thinking of her at that moment. After her grandmother's death, Burnett continued the tradition.\n\n==Broadcast==\nWhen ''The Carol Burnett Show'' made its network debut on CBS-TV in September 1967, it was scheduled on Monday nights at 10:00&nbsp;pm opposite NBC\u2019s ''[[I Spy (1965 TV series)|I Spy]]'' and ABC\u2019s ''[[The Big Valley]]''. At the end of its first season and through the spring of 1971, it consistently ranked among the top-30 programs. (For the 1969\u201370 season, it posted its highest rating ever, ranking at number 13.) For season five, CBS moved the show to Wednesday nights at 8:00&nbsp;pm, where its chief competition was NBC\u2019s ''[[Adam-12]]'' and the ABC sitcoms ''[[Bewitched]]'' and ''[[The Courtship of Eddie's Father]]''. Despite the schedule change, the show continued to do well until the fall of 1972, when the ratings slipped. In December 1972, CBS again moved ''The Carol Burnett Show'' to Saturday nights at 10:00&nbsp;pm (EST) where, for the next four years, it not only received solid ratings, but was also part of a powerhouse Saturday-night lineup of primetime shows that included ''[[All in the Family]]'', ''[[M*A*S*H (TV series)|M*A*S*H]]'', ''[[The Mary Tyler Moore Show]]'', and ''[[The Bob Newhart Show]]''.\n\nIn the 1973\u201374 season, the \"Family\" sketches (with Burnett as Eunice, Korman as her husband Ed, and Lawrence as Eunice's mother) were introduced and the \"Carol and Sis\" segments were phased out. At the end of that season (the series' seventh), after having been with ''The Carol Burnett Show'' from the beginning, Lyle Waggoner left the series to pursue other acting opportunities. The following season, Waggoner's spot as a supporting regular remained vacant. Don Crichton, the lead male dancer on the show, began to inherit some of Waggoner's duties. Then in season nine, because of his many popular guest appearances on the series, Tim Conway was signed as a full-time regular, joining Korman and Lawrence.\n\n[[File:Tim Conway Carol Burnett Dick Van Dyke Carol Burnett Show 1977.JPG|thumb|150px|From left to right: Conway, Burnett, and Dick Van Dyke in the final season]]\nIn November, 1976, the series' tenth year, ''The Carol Burnett Show'' presented what would become one of its best-known and most well-regarded sketches: \"[[Went with the Wind!]],\" a parody of the 1939 film ''[[Gone with the Wind (film)|Gone with the Wind]]'', which had its television debut on NBC the week before. After the 1976-77 season ended, Harvey Korman decided to leave the series. After a decade of working with Burnett and winning several Emmy Awards, Korman had been offered a contract by ABC to headline his own series. Also, the ratings had begun to decline. Nevertheless, CBS renewed Burnett's show for an 11th season.\n\nDick Van Dyke, fresh from headlining his own short-lived Emmy-winning variety series, ''Van Dyke & Company'', was brought in to replace Korman. However, his presence did not help stem the sagging ratings, as the show faced new competition in ABC's ''[[The Love Boat]]''. After three months, Van Dyke departed the show, and CBS, in a desperate attempt to save the series, moved ''The Carol Burnett Show'' from Saturday nights at 10:00&nbsp;pm to Sunday nights at the same hour, beginning in December 1977. Regular guest stars [[Steve Lawrence]] and [[Ken Berry]] were brought in to fill the void left by Korman and Van Dyke. The ratings improved considerably.\n\nCBS wanted to renew the show for another year, but by this time, Burnett had grown tired of the weekly grind and wanted to explore acting roles outside of the comedy genre, despite her success in it. With the changes in cast along with the mediocre ratings, she felt that television was undergoing a transition and that the variety series format was on its way out. Therefore, Burnett decided to end the series on her own rather than be canceled later. Thus, on March 29, 1978, in a special two-hour finale entitled \"[[A Special Evening with Carol Burnett]]\", ''The Carol Burnett Show'' left primetime television after 11 years, finishing its last season in 66th place. Reruns were aired during the summer of 1978.\n\n==Notable characters/sketches==\n\n[[File:Carol Burnett charwoman character 1974.JPG|thumb|150px|Burnett as the Charwoman]]\n[[File:Carol Burnett Madeline Kahn Eunice Carol Burnett Show.JPG|thumb|150px|Burnett as Eunice with [[Madeline Kahn]] in \"The Family\" sketch]]\n\n*[[As the Stomach Turns]] \u2013 a [[soap opera]] parody taking place in the fictional town of Canoga Falls with Burnett as the main character Marion.\n*Carol and Sis \u2013 Burnett as Carol and Lawrence as her sister Chris with Korman as Carol's husband Roger;<ref name=\"Emmy Award Winning Nighttime Television Shows, 1948-2004 1\">{{cite book| first= Wesley| last= Hyatt| year= 2006| title= Emmy Award Winning Nighttime Television Shows, 1948-2004| edition=| publisher= McFarland & Company| location=| pages= 239| isbn= 978-0786423293}}</ref> the sketch was based on Burnett's life in New York raising her kid sister in New York with her first husband, and Lawrence was originally hired just for this sketch.<ref name=\"emmytvlegends.org\">{{cite web|url=http://www.emmytvlegends.org/interviews/people/vicki-lawrence#|title=Vicki Lawrence|work=Archive of American Television|accessdate=9 January 2017}}</ref>\n*The Charwoman \u2013 Burnett's signature character, an unnamed [[charwoman]] (most often in a musical number),<ref name=\"Emmy Award Winning Nighttime Television Shows, 1948-2004 2\">{{cite book| first= Wesley| last= Hyatt| year= 2006| title= Emmy Award Winning Nighttime Television Shows, 1948-2004| edition=| publisher= McFarland & Company| location=| pages= 240| isbn= 978-0786423293}}</ref> whose animated image has been used in the opening credits, and also in the opening and closing credits of ''Carol Burnett and Friends''.\n*Chiquita \u2013 Burnett's parody of [[Charo]];

Many of these film parodies were written or co-written by [[Stan Hart]], [[Arnie Kogen]] and [[Larry Siegel]], all prolific contributors for [[Mad (magazine)|''Mad'']] magazine, with each authoring dozens of the magazine's own movie satires.\n\n==After the series==\n\n===Continuations and revivals===\n{{refimprove section|date=July 2018}}\nIn the fall of 1977, while the series was still running in prime time, the comedy sketches of the show were re-edited into freestanding programs; the resulting show enjoyed success for many years in [[television syndication|syndicated]] [[rerun]]s (as ''Carol Burnett and Friends'', a half-hour edition of selected 1972\u201377 material).\n\nIn the spring of 1979, a year after ''The Carol Burnett Show'' left the air, Burnett and her husband Joe Hamilton were dining in a restaurant with friends, including Tim Conway. At that gathering, Burnett got wistful and started reminiscing about the show and making suggestions to Conway concerning sketches that she wished they could be creating if the show were still running. Hamilton suggested to Burnett that she do a summer series. Taking that idea, Burnett and Hamilton approached CBS about doing a four-week program in the summer of 1979. CBS already had its schedule filled for the summer months and rejected the idea. However, ABC was interested, and as a result, four postscript episodes of ''The Carol Burnett Show'' were produced. Under the title ''[[Carol Burnett & Company]]'', the show premiered on Saturday, August 18, 1979, and included many favorite sketches such as \"Mr. Tudball and Mrs. Wiggins\", \"The Family\", \"As The Stomach Turns\", and Burnett doing her impersonation of Queen Elizabeth II. Its format was very much similar to Burnett's series, with two exceptions. Due to the unavailability of Harvey Korman (who, ironically, had been under contract to ABC since he had left Burnett's show in 1977), comic actors [[Kenneth Mars]] and [[Craig Richard Nelson]] were added to the supporting cast, joining Lawrence and Conway. [[Ernie Flatt]], who had been the choreographer on Burnett's show for its entire 11-year run, was replaced by the show's lead dancer Don Crichton. The guest stars in that four-week period were (chronologically) [[Cheryl Ladd]], [[Alan Arkin]], [[Penny Marshall]], and [[Sally Field]]. The reviews of the series were very favorable, with several critics heartily welcoming Burnett back to weekly television, albeit on a limited basis. The ratings also were respectable and plans were announced for the program to become a yearly summer event, but it never happened.\n\nThe \"Family\" sketches led to a 1982 CBS made-for-television film called ''[[Eunice (film)|Eunice]]'' starring Burnett, Korman, Lawrence, Betty White, and Ken Berry. The success of this program spawned a spin-off sitcom titled ''[[Mama's Family]]'', starring Vicki Lawrence and Ken Berry, which ran from 1983 to 1990. It occasionally featured Burnett and Korman guest-starring as Eunice and Ed Higgins; Burnett's involvement in ''Mama's Family'' was limited due to her divorce from producer [[Joe Hamilton (producer)|Joe Hamilton]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://abcnews.go.com/2020/story?id=123891&page=1 |title=Humor Helps Carol Burnett Cope \u2013 ABC News |publisher=Abcnews.go.com |date= |accessdate=2013-03-01}}</ref> In the first year and a half of the show's run, Korman also appeared as narrator Alastair Quince, introducing each episode (a parody of [[Alastair Cooke]] hosting ''[[Masterpiece Theatre]]'') and he also directed 31 episodes of the series.\n\n[[NBC]] aired a comedy half-hour repertory series called ''[[Carol & Company]]'' that premiered in March 1990. It proved to be moderately successful in the ratings and was renewed for a second season. The regulars on the show included [[Peter Krause]], [[Jeremy Piven]], [[Terry Kiser]], [[Meagen Fay]], [[Anita Barone]], and [[Richard Kind]] (and occasional guest stars, including [[Betty White]] and [[Burt Reynolds]]); each week's show was a different half-hour comedy play. This program lasted until July 1991.\n\nCBS brought back ''The Carol Burnett Show'' for another run in the fall of 1991; new regulars included Meagen Fay and Richard Kind (brought over from the NBC show), and [[Chris Barnes (actor)|Chris Barnes]], [[Roger Kabler]], and [[Jessica Lundy]]. However, the times had changed and Burnett's humor was tame compared to the edgier comedy popular in the 1990s. The series failed to catch on with the public and only six episodes of this revival were aired.\n\nIn 1994, reruns of the syndicated ''Carol Burnett and Friends'' package aired on [[Nick at Nite]]. The show also aired on [[History of Freeform (TV channel)#The Family Channel|The Family Channel]] in 1996 and on [[TV Land]] as part of that network's inaugural lineup from 1996 to 1997 and again from 2004 to 2005.

He has a reputation for being involved in some of the most violent and bloody [[hardcore wrestling]] matches of all time.\n\nOne of Shreve's trademarks is a series of divot-like scars on his head that he has due to excessive use of [[Blading (professional wrestling)|blading]] during his career. The scars are so deep that, according to [[Mick Foley]], Shreve is able to put gambling chips into them. An amateur martial artist, Shreve also has knowledge of [[judo]] and [[karate]], often including this knowledge in his wrestling matches. This knowledge was mainly displayed by him using judo throws and Canadian chops. Hello everybody! I hope you're all doing well. Days will only get better. I'm Samantha I'm 17 and from Iowa. \n\n==Early life==\nShreve was born on January 11, 1941<ref name=\"wrestlingdata.com\"/><ref name=\"wrestlingmuseum.com\">{{cite web|url=http://www.wrestlingmuseum.com/pages/wrestlers/abdullah2.html|title=Professional Wrestling Online Museum \u2013 Abdullah the Butcher|website=www.wrestlingmuseum.com}}</ref><ref name=\"Madman\"/> and raised in [[Windsor, Ontario]], as part of a family of ten people in a deeply impoverished household.<ref name=\"Madman\">{{Cite web|url=http://slam.canoe.ca/Slam/Wrestling/2003/10/31/242993.html |title=Man or Madman?

He initially competed in numerous independent territories in Canada under such various monikers as '''Pussycat Pickens''', '''Kuroi Jujutsushi''' (The Black Wizard) and '''Zelis Amara'''. However, he ultimately created his gimmick of an evil [[Arabian]] sadist; and in a match against [[Gino Brito]]<ref name=\"Madman\" /> (Jack Britton's real-life son), the '''Abdullah the Butcher''' character first distinguished himself as one of the world's most feared rule breakers when he broke a chair over Brito's head and then beat him senseless with the leg.\n\nSince his gimmick required that he speak no English (though it was in actuality his native tongue), he possessed a number of managers over the course of his long career, including [[Gary Hart (wrestler)|Gary Hart]], [[Paul Jones (wrestler)|Paul Jones]], [[Eddie Creatchman]], Black Baron, [[Ernie Roth|The Grand Wizard]], [[James J. Dillon|J.J. Dillon]], [[Damien Kane]], [[Larry Sharpe (wrestler)|Larry Sharpe]], [[Hugo Savinovich]], [[Chicky Starr]], [[Oliver Humperdink]], Buddy Colt, George Cannon, [[Bearcat Wright]], Big Bad John, [[Tony Montana (Director)|Tony Montana]], Gentleman Jim Holiday, and Rock Hunter, who were all portrayed as \"handlers\" commissioned to control the Sudanese madman, while also doing most of the talking in promos and interviews. He has, however, spoken for himself in promos while in Japan.\n\n[[File:AbdullahTheButcher.jpg|thumb|left|Abdullah the Butcher in a match in 2004]]\nAs a result of his frequent traveling, Abdullah the Butcher usually served as more of a special attraction than as a consistent championship contender. Accordingly, Abdullah never did win a world heavyweight championship, though he would capture several regional titles during his career. He won his first major championship on October 23, 1967, when he teamed with Dr. Jerry Graham to defeat [[John Tolos|John]] & Carlos Tolos for the [[National Wrestling Alliance|NWA]]'s [[NWA Canadian Tag Team Championship (Vancouver version)|Canadian Tag Team Titles in Vancouver]]. A few years later, he ventured to the Montreal region, where he had three reigns as the IWA International Heavyweight Champion between 1969 and 1972, feuding against [[Ivan Koloff]] and [[Johnny Rougeau]]. He later served as one of the premier rule breakers in [[Stampede Wrestling|Calgary's Stampede]] territory, capturing the NWA Canadian Championship, as well as having six North American Heavyweight Title reigns during the early 1970s. On June 24, 1972, he defeated Ernie Ladd in Akron, Ohio, to capture his first of two [[NWF Heavyweight Championship]]s. In 1972, he wrestled a few matches for [[World Wide Wrestling Federation]]. Also he worked for [[Stampede Wrestling]] from 1970 to 1974. During the mid-1970s, he frequently performed in [[Detroit, Michigan]]'s Big-Time Wrestling territory, where he engaged in a rivalry against [[Ed Farhat|The Sheik]]. He teamed with \"Killer\" Tim Brooks to win the region's version of the NWA World Tag Team Titles before defeating Bobo Brazil on February 8, 1975, for the NWA United States Championship.\n\nIn addition to his successes in North America, Abdullah the Butcher also performed in the [[Far East]], [[Europe]], the [[Caribbean]], [[Australia]], and [[Africa]]. On March 12, 1974, he traveled all the way to [[New Zealand]], where he captured the British Empire Commonwealth Title by defeating the nation's champion [[John DaSilva]]. Abdullah also established himself as one of the premier attractions in [[Japan]], where he competed as part of the round-robin tournament that ultimately crowned [[Shohei Baba|Giant Baba]] as All-Japan's inaugural PWF Heavyweight Champion in February 1973. On October 18, 1978, Abdullah won that same PWF belt when he defeated European former AWA champion Billy Robinson; and then on October 13, 1980, he also beat [[Jumbo Tsuruta]] to capture the NWA United National Heavyweight Title. He also feuded with [[Terry Funk]] in [[Japan]], and Funk claims to have had one of his top three all-time greatest matches with Abdullah the Butcher.\n\nHe arrived in [[World Class Championship Wrestling]] (WCCW) in 1986, where he defeated [[Great Kabuki|The Great Kabuki]] for the Texas Brass Knuckles Title and waged war against the equally wild [[Bruiser Brody]]. In Puerto Rico, he was declared the very first WWC Universal Heavyweight Champion in July 1982 following three reigns as the Puerto Rican champion between 1978 and 1981.\n\nHe was introduced in [[World Championship Wrestling]] in a giant, gift-wrapped box.<ref name=\"mf202\">{{cite book | author = Mick Foley | title = Have A Nice Day: A Tale of Blood and Sweatsocks | publisher = HarperCollins | year = 2000 | isbn = 0-06-103101-1 | page = 202}}</ref> This giant box was to be Sting's birthday gift from [[Mick Foley|Cactus Jack]].<ref name=\"mf202\"/> Sting unwrapped his gift and Abdullah attacked him, leading to both Abdullah and Cactus feuding with Sting after the incident. The feud culminated in a \"Chamber of Horrors\" match at [[Halloween Havoc (1991)|Halloween Havoc 1991]], in which Cactus accidentally electrocuted Abdullah in an [[electric chair]], leading to a brief [[Feud (professional wrestling)|feud]] between the former allies. \n\nIn 1993, Abdullah arrived in [[Extreme Championship Wrestling|ECW]], where he participated in a storyline with Kevin Sullivan, Terry Funk and Stan Hansen, and wrestled at Ultra Clash and Bloodfest.\n\nIn October 1999, Abdullah took part in the ill-fated [[Heroes of Wrestling]] pay-per-view with a match against the [[One Man Gang]]. The match ended in a double count-out.\n\nIn late 2002, Abdullah made a one-night appearance in [[Ring of Honor]] as Homicide's partner, facing the Carnage Crew in a bloody [[Bunkhouse Brawl]] at ROH's Night of the Butcher.\n\nOn December 13, 2008, Shreve wrestled against [[Balls Mahoney]] in Bayamon Puerto Rico during the annual event WWC Lockout.\n\nDuring July 2009, he wrestled in [[Dragon Gate (wrestling)|Dragon Gate]] and [[Hustle (professional wrestling)|Hustle]]. He also wrestled at the [[New Japan Pro-Wrestling]] supershow [[Wrestle Kingdom IV in Tokyo Dome]] on January 4, 2010, as well as wrestling for Japanese independent promotion Osaka Pro Wrestling.\n\nIn 2009, Abdullah made an appearance at the Decatur Book Festival, facing off against author [[Michael Muhammad Knight]]. Abdullah pummeled Knight with chairs, forks, and a water cooler, not even stepping into the ring. Knight was taken from the festival in an ambulance and received 46 stitches. It was Right After Wrestling in March 2011, hosted by [[Arda Ocal]] and [[Jimmy Korderas]], that Abdullah admitted his favorite wrestler to face was actually [[Lou Thesz]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://radio.thescore.com/episodes/abdullah-the-butcher-raw-feb-28-2011 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=March 22, 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120717002804/http://radio.thescore.com/episodes/abdullah-the-butcher-raw-feb-28-2011 |archivedate=July 17, 2012 }}</ref>\n\nHis last match was on October 9, 2010 in a draw against [[Bull Buchanan]] at GCW Southern Legends Fan Fest.\n\nAlso in 2011, Abdullah returned to [[Georgia Championship Wrestling]] as a mentor and adviser to a local wrestler known as The Congo Warrior.\n\nOn October 20, 2018, it was announced that Abdullah will have his retirement ceremony during the Giant Baba 20th Anniversary Memorial Show on February 19, 2019 at Sumo Hall in Tokyo.\n\n==Legacy==\nThroughout his career, many [[video game]]s have included depictions of Abdullah the Butcher, either as playable characters or as enemies. Some of these, such as ''[[Legends of Wrestling II]]'', have included his name and direct likeness, whereas others such as ''[[HammerLock Wrestling]]'' and ''Appoooh'' include original characters inspired by Abdullah.\n\nCharacters in Japanese anime or manga are also frequently designed to resemble Abdullah the Butcher, often with his signature scars. Examples include Abdullah from ''[[Kinnikuman]]'', Abdullah the Criminal from ''[[One Piece]]'', and Mr. Heart from ''[[Fist of the North Star]]''.\n\n[[File:Abdullah the butcher.jpg|thumb|right|Abdullah the Butcher at his WWE Hall of Fame induction in 2011]]In 2007, the [[WWE]] and [[Jakks Pacific]] released an Abdullah the Butcher \"WWE Classic Superstars\" figure complete with the blade marks on top of his head. A DVD was also released named ''The Triumph and Tragedy of World Class Wrestling'' which included a bloody cage match between Abdullah and his famous rival Bruiser Brody.\n\nThe 2007, WWC's anniversary show was dedicated to Abdullah the Butcher's contributions to WWC.\n\nOn April 2, 2011, Abdullah the Butcher was inducted into the [[WWE Hall of Fame]] in Atlanta, Georgia. In early 2012, Abdullah the Butcher appeared on the ''Wrestling Marks of Excellence'' radio show and said that he had given away his Hall of Fame ring to his brother, saying that he had been in the business and drew people from all over the world and should have been inducted decades ago.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wrestlezone.com/news/249119-wwe-hall-of-famer-gave-away-ring-jr-confirms-raw-status|title=WWE Hall Of Famer Gave Away Ring, JR Confirms RAW Status \u2013 Wrestlezone|date=February 3, 2012|publisher=}}</ref>\n\nFollowing his WWE Hall of Fame induction, [[Superstar Billy Graham]] requested his name be removed from the Hall, saying: \"It is a shameless organization to induct a bloodthirsty animal such as Abdullah the Butcher into their worthless and embarrassing Hall of Fame and I want the name of Superstar Billy Graham to be no part of it.\"<ref name=spit>{{Cite web|url=http://slam.canoe.ca/Slam/Wrestling/2011/04/08/17929556.html|title= Superstar Graham would spit on Jericho's grave, wants out of WWE HOF |accessdate=September 3, 2014|publisher=Canadian Online Explorer|work=SLAM!

He has a reputation for being involved in some of the most violent and bloody [[hardcore wrestling]] matches of all time.\n\nOne of Shreve's trademarks is a series of divot-like scars on his head that he has due to excessive use of [[Blading (professional wrestling)|blading]] during his career. The scars are so deep that, according to [[Mick Foley]], Shreve is able to put gambling chips into them. An amateur martial artist, Shreve also has knowledge of [[judo]] and [[karate]], often including this knowledge in his wrestling matches. This knowledge was mainly displayed by him using judo throws and Canadian chops.\n\n==Early life==\nShreve was born on January 11, 1941<ref name=\"wrestlingdata.com\"/><ref name=\"wrestlingmuseum.com\">{{cite web|url=http://www.wrestlingmuseum.com/pages/wrestlers/abdullah2.html|title=Professional Wrestling Online Museum \u2013 Abdullah the Butcher|website=www.wrestlingmuseum.com}}</ref><ref name=\"Madman\"/> and raised in [[Windsor, Ontario]], as part of a family of ten people in a deeply impoverished household.<ref name=\"Madman\">{{Cite web|url=http://slam.canoe.ca/Slam/Wrestling/2003/10/31/242993.html |title=Man or Madman?

He initially competed in numerous independent territories in Canada under such various monikers as '''Pussycat Pickens''', '''Kuroi Jujutsushi''' (The Black Wizard) and '''Zelis Amara'''. However, he ultimately created his gimmick of an evil [[Arabian]] sadist; and in a match against [[Gino Brito]]<ref name=\"Madman\" /> (Jack Britton's real-life son), the '''Abdullah the Butcher''' character first distinguished himself as one of the world's most feared rule breakers when he broke a chair over Brito's head and then beat him senseless with the leg.\n\nSince his gimmick required that he speak no English (though it was in actuality his native tongue), he possessed a number of managers over the course of his long career, including [[Gary Hart (wrestler)|Gary Hart]], [[Paul Jones (wrestler)|Paul Jones]], [[Eddie Creatchman]], Black Baron, [[Ernie Roth|The Grand Wizard]], [[James J. Dillon|J.J. Dillon]], [[Damien Kane]], [[Larry Sharpe (wrestler)|Larry Sharpe]], [[Hugo Savinovich]], [[Chicky Starr]], [[Oliver Humperdink]], Buddy Colt, George Cannon, [[Bearcat Wright]], Big Bad John, [[Tony Montana (Director)|Tony Montana]], Gentleman Jim Holiday, and Rock Hunter, who were all portrayed as \"handlers\" commissioned to control the Sudanese madman, while also doing most of the talking in promos and interviews. He has, however, spoken for himself in promos while in Japan.\n\n[[File:AbdullahTheButcher.jpg|thumb|left|Abdullah the Butcher in a match in 2004]]\nAs a result of his frequent traveling, Abdullah the Butcher usually served as more of a special attraction than as a consistent championship contender. Accordingly, Abdullah never did win a world heavyweight championship, though he would capture several regional titles during his career. He won his first major championship on October 23, 1967, when he teamed with Dr. Jerry Graham to defeat [[John Tolos|John]] & Carlos Tolos for the [[National Wrestling Alliance|NWA]]'s [[NWA Canadian Tag Team Championship (Vancouver version)|Canadian Tag Team Titles in Vancouver]]. A few years later, he ventured to the Montreal region, where he had three reigns as the IWA International Heavyweight Champion between 1969 and 1972, feuding against [[Ivan Koloff]] and [[Johnny Rougeau]]. He later served as one of the premier rule breakers in [[Stampede Wrestling|Calgary's Stampede]] territory, capturing the NWA Canadian Championship, as well as having six North American Heavyweight Title reigns during the early 1970s. On June 24, 1972, he defeated Ernie Ladd in Akron, Ohio, to capture his first of two [[NWF Heavyweight Championship]]s. In 1972, he wrestled a few matches for [[World Wide Wrestling Federation]]. Also he worked for [[Stampede Wrestling]] from 1970 to 1974. During the mid-1970s, he frequently performed in [[Detroit, Michigan]]'s Big-Time Wrestling territory, where he engaged in a rivalry against [[Ed Farhat|The Sheik]]. He teamed with \"Killer\" Tim Brooks to win the region's version of the NWA World Tag Team Titles before defeating Bobo Brazil on February 8, 1975, for the NWA United States Championship.\n\nIn addition to his successes in North America, Abdullah the Butcher also performed in the [[Far East]], [[Europe]], the [[Caribbean]], [[Australia]], and [[Africa]]. On March 12, 1974, he traveled all the way to [[New Zealand]], where he captured the British Empire Commonwealth Title by defeating the nation's champion [[John DaSilva]]. Abdullah also established himself as one of the premier attractions in [[Japan]], where he competed as part of the round-robin tournament that ultimately crowned [[Shohei Baba|Giant Baba]] as All-Japan's inaugural PWF Heavyweight Champion in February 1973. On October 18, 1978, Abdullah won that same PWF belt when he defeated European former AWA champion Billy Robinson; and then on October 13, 1980, he also beat [[Jumbo Tsuruta]] to capture the NWA United National Heavyweight Title. He also feuded with [[Terry Funk]] in [[Japan]], and Funk claims to have had one of his top three all-time greatest matches with Abdullah the Butcher.\n\nHe arrived in [[World Class Championship Wrestling]] (WCCW) in 1986, where he defeated [[Great Kabuki|The Great Kabuki]] for the Texas Brass Knuckles Title and waged war against the equally wild [[Bruiser Brody]]. In Puerto Rico, he was declared the very first WWC Universal Heavyweight Champion in July 1982 following three reigns as the Puerto Rican champion between 1978 and 1981.\n\nHe was introduced in [[World Championship Wrestling]] in a giant, gift-wrapped box.<ref name=\"mf202\">{{cite book | author = Mick Foley | title = Have A Nice Day: A Tale of Blood and Sweatsocks | publisher = HarperCollins | year = 2000 | isbn = 0-06-103101-1 | page = 202}}</ref> This giant box was to be Sting's birthday gift from [[Mick Foley|Cactus Jack]].<ref name=\"mf202\"/> Sting unwrapped his gift and Abdullah attacked him, leading to both Abdullah and Cactus feuding with Sting after the incident. The feud culminated in a \"Chamber of Horrors\" match at [[Halloween Havoc (1991)|Halloween Havoc 1991]], in which Cactus accidentally electrocuted Abdullah in an [[electric chair]], leading to a brief [[Feud (professional wrestling)|feud]] between the former allies. \n\nIn 1993, Abdullah arrived in [[Extreme Championship Wrestling|ECW]], where he participated in a storyline with Kevin Sullivan, Terry Funk and Stan Hansen, and wrestled at Ultra Clash and Bloodfest.\n\nIn October 1999, Abdullah took part in the ill-fated [[Heroes of Wrestling]] pay-per-view with a match against the [[One Man Gang]]. The match ended in a double count-out.\n\nIn late 2002, Abdullah made a one-night appearance in [[Ring of Honor]] as Homicide's partner, facing the Carnage Crew in a bloody [[Bunkhouse Brawl]] at ROH's Night of the Butcher.\n\nOn December 13, 2008, Shreve wrestled against [[Balls Mahoney]] in Bayamon Puerto Rico during the annual event WWC Lockout.\n\nDuring July 2009, he wrestled in [[Dragon Gate (wrestling)|Dragon Gate]] and [[Hustle (professional wrestling)|Hustle]]. He also wrestled at the [[New Japan Pro-Wrestling]] supershow [[Wrestle Kingdom IV in Tokyo Dome]] on January 4, 2010, as well as wrestling for Japanese independent promotion Osaka Pro Wrestling.\n\nIn 2009, Abdullah made an appearance at the Decatur Book Festival, facing off against author [[Michael Muhammad Knight]]. Abdullah pummeled Knight with chairs, forks, and a water cooler, not even stepping into the ring. Knight was taken from the festival in an ambulance and received 46 stitches. It was Right After Wrestling in March 2011, hosted by [[Arda Ocal]] and [[Jimmy Korderas]], that Abdullah admitted his favorite wrestler to face was actually [[Lou Thesz]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://radio.thescore.com/episodes/abdullah-the-butcher-raw-feb-28-2011 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=March 22, 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120717002804/http://radio.thescore.com/episodes/abdullah-the-butcher-raw-feb-28-2011 |archivedate=July 17, 2012 }}</ref>\n\nHis last match was on October 9, 2010 in a draw against [[Bull Buchanan]] at GCW Southern Legends Fan Fest.\n\nAlso in 2011, Abdullah returned to [[Georgia Championship Wrestling]] as a mentor and adviser to a local wrestler known as The Congo Warrior.\n\nOn October 20, 2018, it was announced that Abdullah will have his retirement ceremony during the Giant Baba 20th Anniversary Memorial Show on February 19, 2019 at Sumo Hall in Tokyo.\n\n==Legacy==\nThroughout his career, many [[video game]]s have included depictions of Abdullah the Butcher, either as playable characters or as enemies. Some of these, such as ''[[Legends of Wrestling II]]'', have included his name and direct likeness, whereas others such as ''[[HammerLock Wrestling]]'' and ''Appoooh'' include original characters inspired by Abdullah.\n\nCharacters in Japanese anime or manga are also frequently designed to resemble Abdullah the Butcher, often with his signature scars. Examples include Abdullah from ''[[Kinnikuman]]'', Abdullah the Criminal from ''[[One Piece]]'', and Mr. Heart from ''[[Fist of the North Star]]''.\n\n[[File:Abdullah the butcher.jpg|thumb|right|Abdullah the Butcher at his WWE Hall of Fame induction in 2011]]In 2007, the [[WWE]] and [[Jakks Pacific]] released an Abdullah the Butcher \"WWE Classic Superstars\" figure complete with the blade marks on top of his head. A DVD was also released named ''The Triumph and Tragedy of World Class Wrestling'' which included a bloody cage match between Abdullah and his famous rival Bruiser Brody.\n\nThe 2007, WWC's anniversary show was dedicated to Abdullah the Butcher's contributions to WWC.\n\nOn April 2, 2011, Abdullah the Butcher was inducted into the [[WWE Hall of Fame]] in Atlanta, Georgia. In early 2012, Abdullah the Butcher appeared on the ''Wrestling Marks of Excellence'' radio show and said that he had given away his Hall of Fame ring to his brother, saying that he had been in the business and drew people from all over the world and should have been inducted decades ago.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wrestlezone.com/news/249119-wwe-hall-of-famer-gave-away-ring-jr-confirms-raw-status|title=WWE Hall Of Famer Gave Away Ring, JR Confirms RAW Status \u2013 Wrestlezone|date=February 3, 2012|publisher=}}</ref>\n\nFollowing his WWE Hall of Fame induction, [[Superstar Billy Graham]] requested his name be removed from the Hall, saying: \"It is a shameless organization to induct a bloodthirsty animal such as Abdullah the Butcher into their worthless and embarrassing Hall of Fame and I want the name of Superstar Billy Graham to be no part of it.\"<ref name=spit>{{Cite web|url=http://slam.canoe.ca/Slam/Wrestling/2011/04/08/17929556.html|title= Superstar Graham would spit on Jericho's grave, wants out of WWE HOF |accessdate=September 3, 2014|publisher=Canadian Online Explorer|work=SLAM!
