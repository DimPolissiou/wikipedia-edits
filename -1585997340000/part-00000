In the [[United States]], [[Canada]] and some other countries, the M.D. denotes a [[professional degree|professional]] [[graduate degree]] awarded upon graduation from [[medical school]].  In the United States, this generally arose because many in 18th-century medical professions trained in [[Scotland]], which used the M.D. degree nomenclature. In England, however, [[Bachelor of Medicine, Bachelor of Surgery]] was used and eventually in the 19th century became the standard in Scotland too. Thus, in the [[United Kingdom]], [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]] and other countries, the M.D. is a research [[doctorate]], [[higher doctorate]], [[honorary degree|honorary]] doctorate or applied clinical degree restricted to those who already hold a professional degree in medicine; in those countries, the equivalent professional to the North American and some others use of M.D. is still typically titled Bachelor of Medicine, Bachelor of Surgery ([[M.B.B.S.]]).<ref name=\"urlECFMG 2008 Information Booklet&nbsp;\u2014 Reference Guide for Medical Education Credentials\">{{cite web |url=http://www.ecfmg.org/creds/refgde.html |title=ECFMG 2008 Information Booklet&nbsp;\u2014 Reference Guide for Medical Education Credentials }}</ref>\n\n==History==\n[[File:Claude Bernard's thesis for his doctorate Wellcome M0011459.jpg|thumb|The [[thesis]] presented by [[Claude Bernard]] to obtain his doctorate of medicine (1843)]]\n\nIn 1703, the [[University of Glasgow]]'s first medical graduate, Samuel Benion, was issued with the [[academic degree]] of Doctor of Medicine.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.gla.ac.uk/schools/medicine/aboutus/history/18thcentury/ |title=A Significant Medical History: 18th Century |publisher=[[University of Glasgow]] |accessdate=10 April 2016}}</ref>\n\nUniversity medical education in England culminated with the MB qualification, and in Scotland the M.D., until in the mid-19th century the public bodies who regulated medical practice at the time required practitioners in Scotland as well as England to hold the dual Bachelor of Medicine and Bachelor of Surgery degrees ([[Bachelor of Medicine|MB BS/MBChB/MB BChir/BM BCh etc.]]). North American medical schools switched to the tradition of the [[ancient universities of Scotland]] and began granting the M.D. title rather than the MB beginning in the late 18th century. The [[Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons]] in New York (which at the time was referred to as King's College of Medicine) was the first American university to grant the M.D. degree instead of the MB.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.columbia.edu/about_columbia/history.html |title=History &#124; Columbia University in the City of New York |publisher=Columbia.edu |date= |accessdate=2015-03-31}}</ref>\n\nEarly medical schools in North America that granted the Doctor of Medicine degrees were [[Columbia University|Columbia]], [[University of Pennsylvania|Penn]], [[Harvard University|Harvard]], [[University of Maryland, Baltimore|Maryland]], and [[McGill University Faculty of Medicine|McGill]].<ref>{{cite journal|title=Crawford DS Montreal, medicine and William Leslie Logie:McGill's first graduate and Canada's medical graduate. 175th.anniversary|url=https://www.mcgill.ca/library/files/library/No1092008.pdf|journal=Osler Library Newsletter|pages=1\u20137|publisher=Mcgill.ca|accessdate=2015-03-31}}</ref> These first few North American medical schools that were established were (for the most part) founded by physicians and surgeons who had been trained in England and Scotland.\n\nA feminine form, \"Doctress of Medicine\" or ''Medicinae Doctrix'', was also used by the [[New England Female Medical College]] in [[Boston]] in the 1860s.<ref>{{cite news|title=The Medical Profession: What Women Have Done in it|issue=1|publisher=[[Godey's Lady's Book]] and Magazine|date=January 1864}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=New England Female Medical College|url=http://iiif.lib.harvard.edu/manifests/view/drs:2650528$176i|newspaper=The Boston Herald|date=March 3, 1864}}</ref><ref>Samuel Gregory, MD.

No pre-medicine courses or bachelor's degree is required. Eligibility is determined through the rank applicants obtain in the public university entrance exam held every year throughout the country. Entry to medical school is competitive, and only students with the highest ranks are accepted into medical programs. The primary medical degree is completed in 7 years. According to the new medical curriculum (from 2016), during the 12th semester, medical students must complete research on a medical topic and provide a thesis as part of their training. Medical graduates are awarded a certificate in general medicine, regarded \"MD\" and validated by the \"Ministry of Higher Education of Afghanistan\". All physicians are to obtain licensing and a medical council registration number from the \"Ministry of Public Health\" before they officially begin to practice. They may subsequently specialize in a specific medical field at medical schools offering the necessary qualifications. After graduation, students may complete [[Residency (medicine)|residency]].\n\nThe MD specification:\nBefore the civil wars in Afghanistan, medical education used to be taught by foreign professors or Afghan professors who studied medical education abroad. The Kabul medical institute certified the students as \"Master of Medicine\". After the civil wars, medical education has extremely changed, and the MD certification has been reduced to \"Medicine Bachelor\".\n\n====Argentina====\nIn [[Argentina]], the First Degree of Physician or [[Physician Diplomate]] ({{Lang-es|T\u00edtulo de M\u00e9dico}})<ref>[http://www.coneau.edu.ar/index.php?idioma=en] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080102010613/http://www.coneau.edu.ar/index.php?idioma=en|date=January 2, 2008}}</ref> is equivalent to the North American MD Degree with six years of intensive studies followed by usually three or four years of [[Medical resident|residency]] as a major specialty in a particular empiric field, consisting of internships, social services and sporadic research. Only by holding a Medical Title can the postgraduate student apply for the Doctor degree through a Doctorate in Medicine program approved by the {{ill|National Commission for University Evaluation and Accreditation|es|Comisi\u00f3n Nacional de Evaluaci\u00f3n y Acreditaci\u00f3n Universitaria|vertical-align=sup}}.<ref>[http://www.coneau.gov.ar/index.php?idioma=en] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070702010802/http://www.coneau.gov.ar/index.php?idioma=en|date=July 2, 2007}}</ref>\n\n====Australia====\n{{see also|Medical education in Australia}}\nHistorically, [[List of medical schools in Australia|Australian medical schools]] have followed the British tradition by conferring the degrees of [[Bachelor of Medicine and Bachelor of Surgery]] (MBBS) to its graduates whilst reserving the title of Doctor of Medicine (MD) for their research training degree, analogous to the [[PhD]], or for their [[honorary doctorates]]. Although the majority of Australian MBBS degrees have been graduate programs since the 1990s, under the previous [[Australian Qualifications Framework]] (AQF) they remained categorized as Level 7 Bachelor's degrees together with other undergraduate programs.\n\nThe latest version of the AQF includes the new category of Level 9 Master's (Extended) degrees which permits the use of the term 'Doctor' in the styling of the degree title of relevant professional programs. As a result, various Australian medical schools have replaced their MBBS degrees with the MD to resolve the previous anomalous nomenclature. With the introduction of the Master's level MD, universities have also renamed their previous medical research doctorates. The [[University of Melbourne]] was the first to introduce the MD in 2011 as a basic medical degree, and has renamed its research degree to Doctor of Medical Science (DMedSc).<ref name=\"auto\">{{cite web|url=http://medicine.unimelb.edu.au/study-here/md|title=Doctor of Medicine (MD)|date=15 January 2014|publisher=University of Melbourne|accessdate=5 July 2014}}</ref>\n\n====Austria====\nIn [[Austria]], medical studies (medicine or dentistry) take 6 years full-time. In medicine, the first two years comprise basic fields of medicine such as anatomy, biology, chemistry, physics, physiology, etc., the next three years consist of all medical fields in the narrower sense with frequent bedside training and medical traineeships while the sixth and last year is dedicated soley to working in a clinic. After this, a specific 6-year training (e.g. in internal medicine, paediatrics, ENT, pathology) or 4 year ([[GP]]) can be started; without this training, working with patients is forbidden. There is no central placement test for said specialist training, only a board-registered spot as a resident/registrar is needed. As with all other studies in Austria, there is no tuition but compulsory students' insurace (approx. 38 \u20ac per year). A specific entrance exam (MedAT, Medizin-Aufnahmetest, medicine acceptance test) has to be taken but is open only once a year in summer; a fee of 110 \u20ac has to be paid. In 2019, 16.443 persons registered for the MedAT and 12.960 took the test<ref>https://www.aufnahmepruefung.at/medizin-studieren-tausende-kaempften-heuer-wieder-fuer-ihren-traum/</ref>. 1.680 university places for both medicine and dentistry are offered each year with 95% of all places for [[EU]] citizens and 75% for applicants with an Austrian higher education entrance qualification/GCE A-levels. Many Germans who are denied studying in their home country try to study medicine in Austria; hence this quota was introduced and approved by the [[EU]] as most of them leave upon graduation<ref>https://www.wienerzeitung.at/nachrichten/politik/europa/892593-Keine-EU-Einwaende-mehr-gegen-Quotenregelung.html</ref>. \n\nThe title of \"Doktor\" is granted to physicians (Dr. med. univ., Doctor medicinae universae, Dr. der gesamten Heilkunde = Dr. \"of the entire art of healing\") and dentists (Dr. med. dent., Doctor medicinae dentinae), who do not possess doctorate degrees, but Master's level 6 year-training, similar to the American [[MD]] or [[Dental degree|DDS]].<ref>[http://www.ris.bka.gv.at/Dokumente/Bundesnormen/NOR40109748/NOR40109748.pdf]</ref> although they have to write a diploma thesis of approx. 50-100 pages. Some of which are published in peer-reviewed journals while others are not. A post-graduate research doctorate (Dr. scient. med., Dr. scientiae medicinae, or [[PhD]]) can be obtained after a three years post-graduate study at a medical university. \n\nAll doctors may be addressed as \"Doktor ______\", and the title is usually contracted to \"Dr. ______\". In many everyday-day settings in Austria, also outside the clinic, it is common to address medical doctors soley as \"Herr/Frau Doktor\" (Mr./Ms./Mrs. doctor) without any specific family name (especially in rural areas and small villages, and by older people), and they are often viewed as the \"real doctors\". Among themselves, MDs don't use \"doctor\" as an appellation but just \"Herr Kollege/Frau Kollegin\" (Mr./Ms/Mrs. = \"dear\" colleague). Consistent use of \"Doktor\" when addressing another medical doctor is seen as confrontative and mockery.\n\n====Belgium====\nIn French-speaking part of Belgium, the medical degree awarded after six years of study is \"Docteur en M\u00e9decine\". Physicians would then have to register with the Ordre des M\u00e9decins to practice medicine in the country.\n\n====Bosnia and Herzegovina====\nIn [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]], the title of \"doktor medicine\" (abbreviated \"dr. med.\") is awarded upon completion of six years of study at a Faculty of Medicine (\"medicinski fakultet\") immediately after high school.\n\n====Bulgaria====\nAt the end of the six-year medical programs from Bulgarian medical schools, medical students are awarded the academic degree Master/Magister in Medicine and the professional title Physician - Doctor of Medicine (MD / MA ).<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.uni-sofia.bg/index.php/eng/the_university/faculties/faculty_of_medicine2/programmes/master_s_programmes/faculty_of_medicine/medicine_in_english_language|title=Medicine (in English language) / Faculty of Medicine / Master's Programmes / Programmes / Faculty of Medicine / Faculties / The University / Home - \u0421\u043e\u0444\u0438\u0439\u0441\u043a\u0438 \u0443\u043d\u0438\u0432\u0435\u0440\u0441\u0438\u0442\u0435\u0442 \"\u0421\u0432. \u041a\u043b\u0438\u043c\u0435\u043d\u0442 \u041e\u0445\u0440\u0438\u0434\u0441\u043a\u0438\"|last=\u041e\u0445\u0440\u0438\u0434\u0441\u043a\u0438|first=\u0421\u043e\u0444\u0438\u0439\u0441\u043a\u0438 \u0423\u043d\u0438\u0432\u0435\u0440\u0441\u0438\u0442\u0435\u0442 \u0421\u0432. \u041a\u043b\u0438\u043c\u0435\u043d\u0442|date=|website=www.uni-sofia.bg}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://mu-varna.bg/EN/Admission/Pages/overview-M.D.-.aspx|title=Admission Overview of the M.D. program|author=|date=|website=mu-varna.bg}}</ref>\n\n====Cambodia====\n{{Contains Khmer text|section}}After 6 years of general medical education (a foundation year plus 5 years), all students will graduate with a Bachelor of Medical Sciences (BMedSc, {{Lang-km|\u1794\u179a\u17b7\u1789\u17d2\u1789\u17b6\u1794\u17d0\u178f\u17d2\u179a \u179c\u17b7\u1791\u17d2\u1799\u17b6\u179f\u17b6\u179f\u17d2\u179a\u17d2\u178f\u179c\u17c1\u1787\u17d2\u1787\u179f\u17b6\u179f\u17d2\u178f\u17d2\u179a}}), equivalent to Bachelor of Science, Bachelor of Surgery (MBBS).

[[McGill University Faculty of Medicine]] is the only medical school in Canada that continues to award the M.D., C.M. degrees (abbreviated M.D.C.M.). M.D.C.M. is from the [[Latin language|Latin]] ''Medicinae Doctor et Chirurgiae Magister'' meaning \"Doctor of Medicine and Master of Surgery\". Upon graduation, students enter into a residency phase of training. Prior to obtaining an independent practicing license from a provincial regulatory body, students must complete the [[Medical Council of Canada Qualifying Examination]] to obtain the [[Licentiate of the Medical Council of Canada]] (LMCC) qualification.<ref>https://mcc.ca/about/lmcc/</ref>\n\n====China====\nIn [[China]], many prestigious research universities such as [[Peking Union Medical College]], [[Peking University Health Science Center]], and [[Shanghai Jiao Tong University]] offer the 8-year Doctor of Medicine program. In the meantime, the majority of primary medical training comes in the form of a 5-year Bachelor of Medicine degree, which includes 2.5 years of basic science and biomedical science training and 2.5 years of clerkship training. Graduates from such programs are eligible to sit for Medical Doctor License Examination in China providing they are working as resident physicians in a hospital. Many of the young doctors do seek further training by entering a 3-year Master of Medicine (clinical track) program or 5-year Doctor of Medicine (clinical track). Some take a job/promotion after the 3-year program and work for a number of years and then take on another 3 years of training to get the ultimate Doctor of Medicine degree.<ref>{{Cite journal |pmc = 4320996|year = 2015|last1 = Wang|first1 = Z.|title = The expansion of 8-year medical training programs in China: A status report|journal = Medical Education Online|volume = 20|pages = 10.3402/meo.v20.25890|last2 = Yin|first2 = Z.|last3 = Wei|first3 = Y.

Medicine was one of the four foundational careers of the first Cuban university named Real y Pontificia Universidad de San Jeronimo de La Habana (current [[University of Havana]]) founded in 1728.\n\n====Dominican Republic====\nIn the [[Dominican Republic]], it is known as \"Doctor en Medicina\" (Doctor in Medicine). In 1511 the Spanish Catholic church founded the first university of the Americas in Santo Domingo present capital of modern-day Dominican Republic and name it Universidad Santo Tomas de Aquino (today Universidad Autonoma de Santo Domingo). In 1630 this university graduated the first medical doctors of the Americas and amongst the graduates some Native Americans included.\n\n====Ecuador====\nIn Ecuador, medical school begins after graduating high-school. There are two options; applying to public or private universities. Both private and public university select their candidates based on entrance exams. Public universities are free while private universities cost around 6,000 - US$12,000 a year. In most universities, the carrier lasts for 6 years. After graduating, students obtain a degree of \u201cm\u00e9dico\u201d or \"m\u00e9dico cirujano\", depending which one is offered by each university. Both degrees are equivalent to doctor of medicine (MD).\n\n====France====\n{{Main|Medical school in France}}\nAfter graduating from high school with a [[Baccalaureat]], any student can register at a university of medicine (there are about 30 of them throughout the country). Until 2018, at the end of first year, an internal ranking examination took place in each of these universities in order to implement the ''[[numerus clausus]]'', this ranking examination and the ''[[numerus clausus]]'' has been abolished since. First year consists mainly of theoretical classes such as [[biophysics]] and [[biochemistry]], [[anatomy]], [[ethics]] or [[histology]]. Passing first year is commonly considered very challenging, requiring hard and continuous work. Each student can only try twice. For example, the [[Universit\u00e9 Ren\u00e9 Descartes]] welcomes about 2,000 students in first year and only 300 after ''numerus clausus''.\n\nThe second and third year are usually mainly quite theoretical although the teachings are often accompanied by placements in the field (e.g., internships as nurses or in the emergency room, depending on the university).\n\nDuring fourth, fifth and sixth years, medical students get a special status called \"''externe''\" (In some universities, such as Pierre et Marie Curie, the ''externe'' status is given starting in the third year). They work as interns every morning at the hospital plus a few night shifts a month and study in the afternoon. Each internship lasts between three and four months and takes place in a different department. Med students get five weeks off a year.\n\nAt the end of the sixth year, they need to pass a national ranking exam, which will determine their specialty. The first student gets to choose first, then the second, et cetera. Usually, students work hard during fifth and sixth years in order to train properly for the national ranking exam. During these years, actual practice at the hospital and some theoretical courses are meant to balance the training.\nSuch externs' average wage stands between 100 and 300 euros a month.\n\nAfter that ranking exams, students can start as residents in the specialty they have been able to pick. That is the point from which they also start getting paid.\n\nTowards the end of the medical program, French [[medical students]] are provided with more responsibilities and are required to defend a thesis; however, unlike a PhD thesis, no original research is actually necessary to write an MD thesis.  At the conclusion of the thesis defense, French medical students receive a State Diploma of Doctor of Medicine (MD, {{Lang-fr|dipl\u00f4me d'Etat de docteur en m\u00e9decine}}). Every new doctor must then proceed to a Diploma of Specialised Studies (DES, {{Lang-fr|dipl\u00f4me d'Etudes sp\u00e9cialis\u00e9es|links=no}}) to mark their specialty.  Some students may also receive a Diploma of Complementary Specialized Studies (DESC, {{Lang-fr|dipl\u00f4me d'Etudes sp\u00e9cialis\u00e9es compl\u00e9mentaires|links=no}}).<ref>{{cite web|title=University and degree systems in France|url=http://af-ksa.com/system/application/uploads/choose_france.pdf|publisher=Af-ksa.com|accessdate=2015-03-31|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151019031848/http://af-ksa.com/system/application/uploads/choose_france.pdf|archivedate=2015-10-19}}</ref>\n\n====Georgia====\nIn [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]], medical universities in Georgia offer a 6-year curriculum leading to award ''Doctor of Medicine (MD)'' \"Physician\" \"Medical Doctor (MD), a European medical degree which is valid throughout the world.

After a medical student finished those five years of study, they need to take \"Uji Kompetensi Mahasiswa Program Profesi Dokter\" (UKMPPD). If they pass the test, they can take Hippocrates Oath and the title of ''Dokter'' (dr.) is entitled before their name. Then they need to take a year-long internship course in primary health care clinics (also known as [[Puskesmas]]) or primary hospitals all over the country to practice as general practitioner under supervision of senior doctors. Those who wished to further their study into specialties can take graduate course of medicine of their preference and will be entitled with \"Specialist of ...\" after their name (e.g.: Sp.A for ''Spesialis Anak'' = Pediatrician). Graduate course of medicine is equal with residency program which is required the candidates to study for four years and hospital internship. Note that \"dr.\" is used for medical graduates, while Dr. (or wrongfully DR.), that is ''Doktor'' is used for [[Doctor of Philosophy|PhD]] holders.\n\n====Iran====\nIn [[Iran]], Medical education begins after high school. No pre-med course or BSc degree is required. The eligibility is determined through the rank applicants obtain in the public university entrance exam being held every year throughout the country. The entry to medical school is competitive and only students with the highest rank are accepted into medical program. The primary medical degree is completed in 7\u20137.5 years. On the final years (last 1\u20132 years) medical students need to do a research on a medical topic and provide thesis as part of their trainings. Medical graduates are awarded a certificate in general medicine, called \"Professional Doctorate in Medicine\" validated by the \"Ministry of Health and Medical Education of Iran\".

Before graduating from a medical school and being awarded the Doctor of Medicine degree, students are required to take the [[United States Medical Licensing Examination]] (USMLE) Step 1 and both the clinical knowledge and clinical skills parts of Step 2. The MD degree is typically earned in four years. Following the awarding of the MD, physicians who wish to practice in the United States are required to complete at least one internship year (PGY-1) and pass the [[USMLE Step 3]]. In order to receive board eligible or board accredited status in a specialty of medicine such as [[general surgery]] or [[internal medicine]], physicians undergo additional specialized training in the form of a [[Residency (medicine)|residency]]. Those who wish to further specialize in areas such as [[cardiology]] or infectious diseases then complete a [[Fellowship (medicine)|fellowship]]. Depending upon the physician's chosen field, residencies and fellowships involve an additional three to eight years of training after obtaining the MD. This can be lengthened with additional research years, which can last one, two, or more years.{{Citation needed|date=October 2018}}\n\nEven though the M.D. is a [[professional degree]] and not a research doctorate (i.e., a Ph.D.), many holders of the M.D. degree conduct clinical and basic scientific [[research]] and publish in [[peer-reviewed journal]]s during training and after graduation; an academic physician whose work emphasizes basic research is called a [[physician-scientist]]. Combined medical and research training is offered through programs granting an [[MD-PhD]]. The [[National Institutes of Health]] (NIH), through its [[Medical Scientist Training Program]], funds M.D.-Ph.D. training programs at many universities.

They start to be member of a medical team. Every morning at the hospital, plus one night shifts per week, and lectures in the afternoon. Each internship lasts between six and four months and takes place in a different department.\n\nThe fifth and sixth year are very similar but this time they applied their previously earned clinical knowledge and skills starting to follow patients independently. At the end of the sixth year, they need to pass a highly supervised medical practice examination in an unserved outpatient center or specialized hospital in order to earn the degree. During these years, there is training at the hospital almost exclusively. Very little theoretical courses are meant to balance the training.

Upon recognition by Bhutan Health and Medical council, they work as medical doctor in country. M.D title is usually given to those who completes 3 to 4 years of residency for specialised course like surgery, medicine pediatrics, etc.\n\n====India====\nThe MBBS (Bachelor of Medicine/Bachelor of Surgery) degree represents the first (undergraduate) level of training required to be licensed as a physician (other degrees in alternative medicine are present like BAMS, BHMS, BSMS etc.) and the MS or MD degree is a postgraduate degree, representative of speciality training. The equivalent training in the US or Canada would be the completion of a medical (post-graduate) degree. Eligibility for the MS or MD course is restricted to medical graduates holding the MBBS degree.\n\nThe MBBS course is for five and a half years, and training imparted is as follows:\n\n# Pre-clinical (Anatomy, Physiology, and Biochemistry)\n# Para-clinical (Pathology, Microbiology, Pharmacology, Forensic Medicine and Community Medicine)\n# Clinical (Ophthalmology, Otorhinolaryngology, General Medicine, General Surgery, Pediatrics and Obstetrics/Gynecology; with speciality rotations such as Orthopaedics, Radiology, etc.).\n\nAfter three years of study and the successful completion of an examination, which includes both theoretical and practical elements, in a pre-clinical or clinical subject of a non-surgical nature [e.g. Anatomy (since the subject deals with study of anatomy through dissecting cadavers, thus given an MD degree), Physiology, Pharmacology, Internal Medicine, Pediatrics, Pathology, Microbiology] the candidate receives MD degree, whereas in a clinical subject of a surgical nature (e.g. General Surgery, Orthopaedics, Obstetrics/Gynaecology, Ophthalmology), the candidate receives the equivalent degree [[Master of Surgery]] (MS).\n\nA second alternate qualification termed DNB [Diplomate of National Board], is considered equivalent to the MD and MS degrees. This can be obtained by passing the exam conducted by the [[National Board of Examinations]] after completing 3 years of post-MBBS residency training in teaching hospitals recognised by the board. The College of Physicians & Surgeons of Bombay, India (Established 1912) also awards higher postgraduate degrees in clinical and pre-clinical specialities, called FCPS; it involves three years of study and the successful completion of an examination, which includes both theoretical and practical elements, and a research thesis and a viva. The FCPS is representative of speciality clinical training, and equivalent to MD/MS/DNB/Ph.D Medical in Medical Doctorate in other parts of the world. Until 2007, the Government of India and the Medical Council of India recognised the FCPS qualification - since then, this is being done by State Medical Councils.\n\nAfter obtaining the first postgraduate degree, that is MD/MS/FCPS/DNB/Ph.D Medical, one can go for further specialisation in medical or surgical fields. This involves a highly competitive entrance examination. This course has three years of additional training and requires the submission of a dissertation (thesis). This is considered a clinical doctorate as the focus is on preparing a super-specialist with adequate clinical as well as research training. After the dissertation is approved and the exit examination (theory and practical) is cleared, the degree awarded is DM (Doctor of Medicine), Ph.D Medical . Based on the specific field of training, the degree awarded is DM in Cardiac Anaesthesia, Cardiology, Neurology, Nephrology, Gastroenterology, Neuroradiology, Critical Care, Pulmonology, Hematology, Medical Oncology, Clinical Pharmacology, Pediatric Critical Care, Pediatric Neurology, Neonataology, Pediatric Gastroenterology, Neuroanaesthesia, etc. For surgical superspecialities the degree awarded is MCh (Magister Chirurgiae), like MCh in Cardio-thoracic and Vascular Surgery, Endocrine Surgery, Neurosurgery, Surgical Gastroenterology, Urology, Plastic Surgery, Pediatric Surgery etc. DM and MCh are the clinical equivalent of a Doctorate degree.  A third alternate qualification is DNB (superspecialties), offered by [[National Board of Examinations]], like DNB in Cardiology, Neurology, Cardiac Surgery, Neurosurgery.\n\nFollowing DM or MCh, one can further go for postdoctoral fellowship programs of one-year duration in specific subspecialties like Cardiac Electrophysiology, Invasive cardiology, Pediatric cardiology, Epilepsy, stroke, electroencephalography, movement disorders, neuromuscular disorders, cerebrovascular surgery, skull base surgery, neurocritical care, pediatric cardiac surgery etc. offered by prestigious government institutes and abroad.\n\n====Pakistan====\n\nIn [[Pakistan]] the MD is a higher doctorate, awarded by medical universities based on successful completion of a residency program of four to six years' duration in a university hospital. Many universities are offering MD. Parallel to MD, MS is a higher doctorate awarded on successful completion of four to six years' duration of a residency program in surgical field.\n\n====Sri Lanka====\nIn [[Sri Lanka]], the MD degree is a higher postgraduate degree that is awarded by the Postgraduate Institute of Medicine after completion of a postgraduate course, examinations and speciality training. The MD degree in Sri Lanka is representative of specialty training in clinical, para clinical, and preventive medicine (e.g., general medicine, cardiology, nephrology, oncology, para clinical such as microbiology, haematology and preventive such as community medicine). Entry for the MD course is open only for medical graduates holding the MBBS degree (with a duration of five and a half years), and training is obtained in medical disciplines that are non-surgical in nature (e.g., internal medicine, radiology, pathology, etc.) After three or four years of study and the successful completion of an examination with written as well as cases and via examinations, the MD degree in the respective field of study is awarded. In community medicine and medical administration, part I examination consists of a theoretical exam while the degree is conferred after completion of a thesis as a PhD. This thesis has to be completed within a period of five years. After successfully defending the academic thesis, the MD degree is conferred to the candidate. The MD degree holder is certified as a board certified specialist by the respective board of study of the Postgraduate Institute of Medicine after he or she undergoes 2\u20134 years of local and foreign training depending on the specialty/subspecialty selected.\n\nIn [[Ayurveda]], [[Bachelor of Ayurveda, Medicine and Surgery]] [[Bachelor of Ayurveda, Medicine and Surgery|B.A.M.S.]] in [[Unani medicine|Unani]], Bachelor of Unani Medicine and Surgery BUMS in [[Siddha medicine|Sidha]], Bachelor of Sidha Medicine and Surgery BSMS are the basic qualification for practicing Ayurveda, Unani,&Sidha. The [[Bachelor of Ayurveda, Medicine and Surgery|B.A.M.S.]], B.U.M.S., and B.S.M.S. are 6-year degree (including internship) courses accepted by the [[University Grants Commission (Sri Lanka)]]. M.D (Ayu)([[Ayurveda vachaspati]]) can be done after [[Bachelor of Ayurveda, Medicine and Surgery|B.A.M.S.]], as a specialty, and it takes 3 years (including submission of a thesis) to complete the course. Ayurveda M.D (Ayu) (Ayurveda vachaspati) is a master's degree accepted by [[University Grants Commission (Sri Lanka)]], after completion of [[MPhil]] can follow [[Ph.D.]]-level programmes in [[Sri Lanka]].\n\n===Research degrees===\n====United Kingdom, Ireland and some Commonwealth countries====\nThe entry-level first professional degree in these countries for the practice of medicine is that of [[Bachelor of Medicine and Surgery|Bachelor of Medicine and Bachelor of Surgery]] (MBBS, MB, MB BCh BAO, BMBS, MBBChir, or MBChB). This degree typically requires between four and six years of study and clinical training, and is equivalent to the North American MD degree. Due to the UK code for higher education, first degrees in medicine comprise an integrated programme of study and professional practice spanning several levels. These degrees may retain, for historical reasons, \"Bachelor of Medicine, Bachelor of Surgery\" and are abbreviated to MBChB, MBBS or BMBS.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.qaa.ac.uk/en/Publications/Documents/Framework-Higher-Education-Qualifications-08.pdf|title=The framework for higher education qualifications in England, Wales and Northern Ireland|publisher=Qaa.ac.uk|accessdate=2015-03-31|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150513125305/http://www.qaa.ac.uk/en/Publications/Documents/Framework-Higher-Education-Qualifications-08.pdf|archive-date=2015-05-13|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nIn the UK, Ireland and many [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] countries, the MD is a postgraduate research degree in medicine. At some universities, this takes the form of a first doctorate, analogous to the Ph.D., awarded upon submission of a thesis and a successful ''viva''.

Therefore, graduates from the MBBS/MBChB/BMBS degrees do not hold doctorates; however, physicians holding these degrees are referred to as \"doctor\" as they are fully licensed as medical practitioners. In some commonwealth nations, these interns are designated as \"house officers\".\n\nAt some other universities (especially older institutions, such as [[University of Oxford|Oxford]], [[University of Dublin|Dublin]], [[University of Cambridge|Cambridge]] and [[University of St Andrews|St Andrews]], but also the relatively new [[James Cook University]]<ref>{{cite web |title=Higher Doctorate Degrees |url=https://www.jcu.edu.au/course-and-subject-handbook-2017/general-information/higher-doctorate-degrees |website=www.jcu.edu.au |publisher=James Cook University |accessdate=14 March 2020 |language=en-AU |date=26 March 2018}}</ref>), the MD is a [[higher doctorate]] (similar to a [[DSc]]) awarded upon submission of a portfolio of published work representing a substantial contribution to medical research.<ref name=\"hawkins\">CF Hawkins, \"Write the MD Thesis\" in \"How To Do It\" London: British Medical Association 2nd ed. 1985 {{ISBN|0-7279-0186-9}}</ref> The University of Cambridge has introduced a new degree of MedScD (more akin to the ScD degree) awarded on the basis of a career's contribution to the science or art of medicine, rather than a thesis, for which a candidate may be awarded the MD degree.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.admin.cam.ac.uk/reporter/2011-12/weekly/6248/section6.shtml|title=Reports - Cambridge University Reporter 6248|date=2011-12-07|publisher=Admin.cam.ac.uk|accessdate=2013-07-15}}</ref> Oxford did not do the same but instead demoted the rank of the degree the same level as the DPhil but retaining its original academic dress.\n\nIn the case where the MD is awarded (either as a first or higher doctorate) for previously published research, the candidate is usually required to be either a graduate or a full-time member of staff, of several years' standing of the university in question.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.uq.edu.au/study/program.html?acad_prog=7504|title=Courses and Programs - The University of Queensland, Australia|publisher=Uq.edu.au|accessdate=2015-03-31|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150402104439/http://www.uq.edu.au/study/program.html?acad_prog=7504|archive-date=2015-04-02|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n===Equivalent degrees in other countries===<!-- PLEASE keep in ALPHABETICAL ORDER -->\n*In [[Bangladesh]], the basic medical degree is the MBBS. After completing the intermediate level of education (12 years) the candidate must undergo 5 years of medical training in any medical college to achieve the MBBS degree. After obtaining the degree, the candidate needs to undergo one year of internship to obtain BMDC (Bangladesh medical and dental council) accreditation in order to practice in the country.\n*In [[mainland China]], some medical schools award MBBS to foreign students while all medical schools award Bachelor of Medicine to nationals. Some MD degrees are higher academic research degrees.\n*In [[Colombia]], the medicine faculties of the universities awards the title of \"Medico Cirujano\" after taking 12 semesters of studies on  \"all clinic and surgery discipline a two semester on internship. After receiving the degree there is a mandatory year \"obliged social work\" were the doctors practice as GP in the countryside. Residency programs last between 3\u20134 years depends on the specialty.\n*The [[Czech Republic|Czech]] and [[Slovakia|Slovak]] title MUDr. (Medicinae Universae doctor or ''doktor medic\u00edny'') is a professional doctorate granted upon completion of six years pregraduate Master's study at medical schools. The postgraduate academic research degree in medicine is a PhD degree.\n*The [[Denmark|Danish]] and [[Norway|Norwegian]] [[Candidatus medicinae]] or [[Candidata medicinae]] degrees (cand. med.) is awarded after completing a six-year medical programme, to which students apply directly upon finishing secondary school. The programme usually includes a small thesis. However, the cand. med. degree must not be confused with the previous Danish and Norwegian [[Doctor Medicinae (Danish and Norwegian degree)|Dr. Med.]] degree, which is a separate degree from the Ph.D. and represents a higher degree of medical research experience. It typically consists of at least 5\u20136 original publications.\n*In [[Finland]], the duration of basic medical education is six years and the course leads to the degree of Licentiate of Medicine.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.oulu.fi/studiesarchive2013/5-6-year-degree-programmes-2013-2014/licentiate-medicine-md-0|title=Medicine, Medical licentiate|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=[[University of Oulu]]|language=fi|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191216132215/https://www.oulu.fi/studiesarchive2013/5-6-year-degree-programmes-2013-2014/licentiate-medicine-md-0|archive-date=16 December 2019|access-date=30 July 2017}}</ref>\n*In [[Greece]], after a six-year study, a medical student acquires his medical degree and the right to use \"\u0394\u03c1.\", (Dr.) before his name. This is considered equivalent to the MD title.\n*In [[Kosovo]], there are medical high schools. Students from elementary school can choose to attend the medical high school, which lasts 3 years. When they finish the 3 years of medical high school, they practice for 4 months. After that, they can be a nurse or they can go to medical facilities in Pristina, with the education there taking around 6 years, including practice, to become a doctor.\n*In [[Mexico]] and [[Peru]], schools of medicine award the \"T\u00edtulo de M\u00e9dico Cirujano\" degree after completing either six or seven years of study. This curriculum includes a rotating internship year and a year of social service providing care to an underserved community.\n*In [[Nepal]], a MBBS degree is awarded. This is an undergraduate level degree, which is awarded after completion of four and half years of medical school followed by one year of clinical internship. Most medical schools also offer postgraduate M.D and M.S. degrees, which requires three years of further training. Post-doctorate D.M. and M.Ch. terminal degrees are awarded by a few elite institutions after three more years of super-speciality training.\n*In the [[Netherlands]], medical students receive six years of university education prior to their graduation. Prospective students can apply for medical education directly after finishing the highest level of secondary school, [[voorbereidend wetenschappelijk onderwijs|vwo]]; previous undergraduate education is not a precondition for admittance. Medical students receive three years of preclinical training, followed by three years of clinical training (''co-assistentschappen'', or ''co-schappen'') in hospitals. At one medical faculty ([[Utrecht University]]), clinical training already begins in the third year of medical school. After 6 years, students graduate as ''Basisartsen'' (\"base physician\"). As a result of the [[Bologna process]], medical students in the Netherlands receive a [[Bachelor of Science|bachelor's degree (BSc)]] concluding successfully three years of medical university curriculum, and a [[Master of Science|master's degree (MSc)]] upon successful graduation. After graduation, physicians can apply for, and complete a R&D based doctorate, earning them a [[Doctor of Philosophy|PhD in Medicine]]. Contrary to popular (international) daily use, the title \"MD\" does not exist, is not granted, nor recognised for Dutch physicians. Furthermore, no specific notation signifying [[Medical license|board registration]] exists for physicians in the Netherlands.\n*In [[Belgium]], Belgian medical education is much more based on theoretical knowledge than the Dutch system. In the first three years, which are very theoretical and lead to a university bachelor's degree, general scientific courses are taken such as chemistry, biophysics, physiology, biostatistics, anatomy, virology, etc. To enter the bachelor course in [[Flanders]], prospective students have to pass an exam, as a result of the ''numerus clausus''. After the bachelor courses, students are allowed to enter the 'master in medicine' courses, which consist of three years of theoretical and clinical study. In general, the first two master years are very theoretical and teach the students human pathology, diseases and pharmacology.  The third year is a year full of internships in a wide range of specialities in different clinics. The seventh, final year serves as a kind of 'pre-specialization' year in which the students are specifically trained in the specialty they wish to pursue after medical school. This contrasts with the Dutch approach, in which graduates are literally 'basic doctors' (''basisartsen'') who have yet to decide on a specialty.\n*In [[Portugal]], to practice medicine, a master's degree in medicine (awarded after a 6-year Integrated master's program in medicine) is mandatory. Before the 2007 Bologna Process, the same course was only a Licentiate Degree. After the 6-year program, students must go through the National Seriation Exam (''Prova Nacional de Seria\u00e7\u00e3o''), and then a year of General Medical Internship (''Ano Comum''). When the internship ends, the students are placed in their choice of Medical Specialty, according to their ranking in the aforementioned Exam and the vacancies available for each medical specialty. Only when each student finishes the Medical Internship, will they be allowed to practice medicine without supervision. Entry to the Integrated Masters Program in Medicine is done directly after High School, based on the student's grade - each year there are about 1800 new Medical Students in Portugal, in 8 different Medical Schools.\n*In [[Sudan]] the awarded degree in most of the medical schools is, Bachelor of Medicine and Basic Surgery (MBBS). In schools that are based on the English system of medical teaching, the degree is granted after six years of studying. As for the schools that are adopting the American system, they grant their students the degree of MBBS in only five years.\n*In Sweden, medical education begins with a five-and-a-half-year undergraduate university program leading to the degree \"Master of Science in Medicine\" ({{lang-sv|L\u00e4karexamen}}). Following this, the [[National Board of Health and Welfare (Sweden)|National Board of Health and Welfare]] requires a minimum of 18 months of clinical internship ({{lang-sv|Allm\u00e4ntj\u00e4nstg\u00f6ring}}) before granting a medical license ({{lang-sv|L\u00e4karlegitimation}}) to be fully qualified as the Swedish equivalent to Medical Doctor (MD).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.socialstyrelsen.se/applicationforswedishlicencetopractiseothercountries/doctorofmedicine|title=License to practice medicine in Sweden|publisher=Socialstyrelsen.se|accessdate=2015-03-31|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150321033725/http://www.socialstyrelsen.se/applicationforswedishlicencetopractiseothercountries/doctorofmedicine|archive-date=2015-03-21|url-status=dead}}</ref> This internship consists of surgery (3\u20136 months), internal medicine (3\u20136 months), psychiatry (three months) and family medicine (six months). Upon receiving a license to practice, a physician is able to apply for a post to start specialist training. There are currently 52 recognised medical specialties in Sweden. The specialist training has a duration of minimum five years, which upon completion grants formal qualification as a specialist.\n\n===Other postgraduate clinical degrees===\nThere is also a similar advanced professional degree to the postgraduate MD: the [[Master of Surgery]] (usually ChM or MS, but [[MCh]] in Scotland, Ireland, Wales and at Oxford and MChir at Cambridge). The equivalence of these degrees, but their differing names, prevents the need for surgeons (addressed as Mr. in the UK) having to revert to the title Dr., which they once held as new MBBS graduates.\n\nIn Ireland, where the basic medical qualification includes a degree in obstetrics, there is a similar higher degree of Master of the Art of Obstetrics (MAO). A Master of Midwifery was formerly examined by the [[Worshipful Society of Apothecaries of London]] (hence MMSA) but fell into abeyance in the 1960s; in this case, the term Master referred not to a university degree but rather a professional rank that is common among craft guilds.\n\nIn [[East Africa]], the medical schools in [[Kenya]], [[Tanzania]] and [[Uganda]] award the degree of [[Master of Medicine]] (MMed) degree in both surgical and medical specialty disciplines following a three to six-year period of instruction.\n\nIn West Africa, the West African College of Physicians and the West African College of Surgeons award the Fellowship of the West African College of Physicians (FWACP) and the Fellowship of the West African College of Surgeons (FWACS) in medical and surgical disciplines respectively after a minimum of four-year residency training period.\n\nThe [[Osteopathic medicine in the United States|Doctor of Osteopathic Medicine]] or [[Doctor of Osteopathic Medicine|DO]] degree allows the same practice rights in the United States and Canada to the MD degree and Doctors of Osteopathic Medicine are fully licensed physicians. Holders of the MD degree must pass MD level board exams while DO holders can pass either the DO (COMLEX) exam or MD exam (USMLE).<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.usmle.org/bulletin/eligibility/|title=United States Medical Licensing Examination {{!}} USMLE Bulletin {{!}} Eligibility|website=www.usmle.org|language=en|access-date=2018-06-27}}</ref> Similarly, MDs must attend MD rated residency and fellowship programs while DOs can attend either MD programs or Osteopathic (DO) programs.

In the [[United States]], [[Canada]] and some other countries, the M.D. denotes a [[professional degree|professional]] [[graduate degree]] awarded upon graduation from [[medical school]].  In the United States, this generally arose because many in 18th-century medical professions trained in [[Scotland]], which used the M.D. degree nomenclature. In England, however, [[Bachelor of Medicine, Bachelor of Surgery]] was used and eventually in the 19th century became the standard in Scotland too. Thus, in the [[United Kingdom]], [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]] and other countries, the M.D. is a research [[doctorate]], [[higher doctorate]], [[honorary degree|honorary]] doctorate or applied clinical degree restricted to those who already hold a professional degree in medicine; in those countries, the equivalent professional to the North American and some others use of M.D. is still typically titled Bachelor of Medicine, Bachelor of Surgery ([[M.B.B.S.]]).<ref name=\"urlECFMG 2008 Information Booklet&nbsp;\u2014 Reference Guide for Medical Education Credentials\">{{cite web |url=http://www.ecfmg.org/creds/refgde.html |title=ECFMG 2008 Information Booklet&nbsp;\u2014 Reference Guide for Medical Education Credentials }}</ref>\n\n==History==\n[[File:Claude Bernard's thesis for his doctorate Wellcome M0011459.jpg|thumb|The [[thesis]] presented by [[Claude Bernard]] to obtain his doctorate of medicine (1843)]]\n\nIn 1703, the [[University of Glasgow]]'s first medical graduate, Samuel Benion, was issued with the [[academic degree]] of Doctor of Medicine.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.gla.ac.uk/schools/medicine/aboutus/history/18thcentury/ |title=A Significant Medical History: 18th Century |publisher=[[University of Glasgow]] |accessdate=10 April 2016}}</ref>\n\nUniversity medical education in England culminated with the MB qualification, and in Scotland the M.D., until in the mid-19th century the public bodies who regulated medical practice at the time required practitioners in Scotland as well as England to hold the dual Bachelor of Medicine and Bachelor of Surgery degrees ([[Bachelor of Medicine|MB BS/MBChB/MB BChir/BM BCh etc.]]). North American medical schools switched to the tradition of the [[ancient universities of Scotland]] and began granting the M.D. title rather than the MB beginning in the late 18th century. The [[Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons]] in New York (which at the time was referred to as King's College of Medicine) was the first American university to grant the M.D. degree instead of the MB.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.columbia.edu/about_columbia/history.html |title=History &#124; Columbia University in the City of New York |publisher=Columbia.edu |date= |accessdate=2015-03-31}}</ref>\n\nEarly medical schools in North America that granted the Doctor of Medicine degrees were [[Columbia University|Columbia]], [[University of Pennsylvania|Penn]], [[Harvard University|Harvard]], [[University of Maryland, Baltimore|Maryland]], and [[McGill University Faculty of Medicine|McGill]].<ref>{{cite journal|title=Crawford DS Montreal, medicine and William Leslie Logie:McGill's first graduate and Canada's medical graduate. 175th.anniversary|url=https://www.mcgill.ca/library/files/library/No1092008.pdf|journal=Osler Library Newsletter|pages=1\u20137|publisher=Mcgill.ca|accessdate=2015-03-31}}</ref> These first few North American medical schools that were established were (for the most part) founded by physicians and surgeons who had been trained in England and Scotland.\n\nA feminine form, \"Doctress of Medicine\" or ''Medicinae Doctrix'', was also used by the [[New England Female Medical College]] in [[Boston]] in the 1860s.<ref>{{cite news|title=The Medical Profession: What Women Have Done in it|issue=1|publisher=[[Godey's Lady's Book]] and Magazine|date=January 1864}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=New England Female Medical College|url=http://iiif.lib.harvard.edu/manifests/view/drs:2650528$176i|newspaper=The Boston Herald|date=March 3, 1864}}</ref><ref>Samuel Gregory, MD.

No pre-medicine courses or bachelor's degree is required. Eligibility is determined through the rank applicants obtain in the public university entrance exam held every year throughout the country. Entry to medical school is competitive, and only students with the highest ranks are accepted into medical programs. The primary medical degree is completed in 7 years. According to the new medical curriculum (from 2016), during the 12th semester, medical students must complete research on a medical topic and provide a thesis as part of their training. Medical graduates are awarded a certificate in general medicine, regarded \"MD\" and validated by the \"Ministry of Higher Education of Afghanistan\". All physicians are to obtain licensing and a medical council registration number from the \"Ministry of Public Health\" before they officially begin to practice. They may subsequently specialize in a specific medical field at medical schools offering the necessary qualifications. After graduation, students may complete [[Residency (medicine)|residency]].\n\nThe MD specification:\nBefore the civil wars in Afghanistan, medical education used to be taught by foreign professors or Afghan professors who studied medical education abroad. The Kabul medical institute certified the students as \"Master of Medicine\". After the civil wars, medical education has extremely changed, and the MD certification has been reduced to \"Medicine Bachelor\".\n\n====Argentina====\nIn [[Argentina]], the First Degree of Physician or [[Physician Diplomate]] ({{Lang-es|T\u00edtulo de M\u00e9dico}})<ref>[http://www.coneau.edu.ar/index.php?idioma=en] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080102010613/http://www.coneau.edu.ar/index.php?idioma=en|date=January 2, 2008}}</ref> is equivalent to the North American MD Degree with six years of intensive studies followed by usually three or four years of [[Medical resident|residency]] as a major specialty in a particular empiric field, consisting of internships, social services and sporadic research. Only by holding a Medical Title can the postgraduate student apply for the Doctor degree through a Doctorate in Medicine program approved by the {{ill|National Commission for University Evaluation and Accreditation|es|Comisi\u00f3n Nacional de Evaluaci\u00f3n y Acreditaci\u00f3n Universitaria|vertical-align=sup}}.<ref>[http://www.coneau.gov.ar/index.php?idioma=en] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070702010802/http://www.coneau.gov.ar/index.php?idioma=en|date=July 2, 2007}}</ref>\n\n====Australia====\n{{see also|Medical education in Australia}}\nHistorically, [[List of medical schools in Australia|Australian medical schools]] have followed the British tradition by conferring the degrees of [[Bachelor of Medicine and Bachelor of Surgery]] (MBBS) to its graduates whilst reserving the title of Doctor of Medicine (MD) for their research training degree, analogous to the [[PhD]], or for their [[honorary doctorates]]. Although the majority of Australian MBBS degrees have been graduate programs since the 1990s, under the previous [[Australian Qualifications Framework]] (AQF) they remained categorized as Level 7 Bachelor's degrees together with other undergraduate programs.\n\nThe latest version of the AQF includes the new category of Level 9 Master's (Extended) degrees which permits the use of the term 'Doctor' in the styling of the degree title of relevant professional programs. As a result, various Australian medical schools have replaced their MBBS degrees with the MD to resolve the previous anomalous nomenclature. With the introduction of the Master's level MD, universities have also renamed their previous medical research doctorates. The [[University of Melbourne]] was the first to introduce the MD in 2011 as a basic medical degree, and has renamed its research degree to Doctor of Medical Science (DMedSc).<ref name=\"auto\">{{cite web|url=http://medicine.unimelb.edu.au/study-here/md|title=Doctor of Medicine (MD)|date=15 January 2014|publisher=University of Melbourne|accessdate=5 July 2014}}</ref>\n\n====Austria====\nIn [[Austria]], medical studies (medicine or dentistry) take 6 years full-time. In medicine, the first two years comprise basic fields of medicine such as anatomy, biology, chemistry, physics, physiology, etc., the next three years consist of all medical fields in the narrower sense with frequent bedside training and medical traineeships while the sixth and last year is dedicated soley to working in a clinic. After this, a specific 6-year training (e.g. in internal medicine, paediatrics, ENT, pathology) or 4 year ([[GP]]) can be started; without this training, working with patients is forbidden. There is no central placement test for said specialist training, only a board-registered spot as a resident/registrar is needed. As with all other studies in Austria, there is no tuition but compulsory students' insurace (approx. 38 \u20ac per year). A specific entrance exam (MedAT, Medizin-Aufnahmetest, medicine acceptance test) has to be taken but is open only once a year in summer; a fee of 110 \u20ac has to be paid. In 2019, 16.443 persons registered for the MedAT and 12.960 took the test<ref>https://www.aufnahmepruefung.at/medizin-studieren-tausende-kaempften-heuer-wieder-fuer-ihren-traum/</ref>. 1.680 university places for both medicine and dentistry are offered each year with 95% of all places for [[EU]] citizens and 75% for applicants with an Austrian higher education entrance qualification/GCE A-levels. Many Germans who are denied studying in their home country try to study medicine in Austria; hence this quota was introduced and approved by the [[EU]] as most of them leave upon graduation<ref>https://www.wienerzeitung.at/nachrichten/politik/europa/892593-Keine-EU-Einwaende-mehr-gegen-Quotenregelung.html</ref>. \n\nThe title of \"Doktor\" is granted to physicians (Dr. med. univ., Doctor medicinae universae, Dr. der gesamten Heilkunde = Dr. \"of the entire art of healing\") and dentists (Dr. med. dent., Doctor medicinae dentinae), who do not possess doctorate degrees, but Master's level 6 year-training, similar to the American [[MD]] or [[DDS]].<ref>[http://www.ris.bka.gv.at/Dokumente/Bundesnormen/NOR40109748/NOR40109748.pdf]</ref> although they have to write a diploma thesis of approx. 50-100 pages. Some of which are published in peer-reviewed journals while others are not. A post-graduate research doctorate (Dr. scient. med., Dr. scientiae medicinae, or [[PhD]]) can be obtained after a three years post-graduate study at a medical university. \n\nAll doctors may be addressed as \"Doktor ______\", and the title is usually contracted to \"Dr. ______\". In many everyday-day settings in Austria, also outside the clinic, it is common to address medical doctors soley as \"Herr/Frau Doktor\" (Mr./Ms./Mrs. doctor) without any specific family name (especially in rural areas and small villages, and by older people), and they are often viewed as the \"real doctors\". Among themselves, MDs don't use \"doctor\" as an appellation but just \"Herr Kollege/Frau Kollegin\" (Mr./Ms/Mrs. = \"dear\" colleague). Consistent use of \"Doktor\" when addressing another medical doctor is seen as confrontative and mockery.\n\n====Belgium====\nIn French-speaking part of Belgium, the medical degree awarded after six years of study is \"Docteur en M\u00e9decine\".

[[McGill University Faculty of Medicine]] is the only medical school in Canada that continues to award the M.D., C.M. degrees (abbreviated M.D.C.M.). M.D.C.M. is from the [[Latin language|Latin]] ''Medicinae Doctor et Chirurgiae Magister'' meaning \"Doctor of Medicine and Master of Surgery\". Upon graduation, students enter into a residency phase of training. Prior to obtaining an independent practicing license from a provincial regulatory body, students must complete the [[Medical Council of Canada Qualifying Examination]] to obtain the [[Licentiate of the Medical Council of Canada]] (LMCC) qualification.<ref>https://mcc.ca/about/lmcc/</ref>\n\n====China====\nIn [[China]], many prestigious research universities such as [[Peking Union Medical College]], [[Peking University Health Science Center]], and [[Shanghai Jiao Tong University]] offer the 8-year Doctor of Medicine program. In the meantime, the majority of primary medical training comes in the form of a 5-year Bachelor of Medicine degree, which includes 2.5 years of basic science and biomedical science training and 2.5 years of clerkship training. Graduates from such programs are eligible to sit for Medical Doctor License Examination in China providing they are working as resident physicians in a hospital. Many of the young doctors do seek further training by entering a 3-year Master of Medicine (clinical track) program or 5-year Doctor of Medicine (clinical track). Some take a job/promotion after the 3-year program and work for a number of years and then take on another 3 years of training to get the ultimate Doctor of Medicine degree.<ref>{{Cite journal |pmc = 4320996|year = 2015|last1 = Wang|first1 = Z.|title = The expansion of 8-year medical training programs in China: A status report|journal = Medical Education Online|volume = 20|pages = 10.3402/meo.v20.25890|last2 = Yin|first2 = Z.|last3 = Wei|first3 = Y.

Medicine was one of the four foundational careers of the first Cuban university named Real y Pontificia Universidad de San Jeronimo de La Habana (current [[University of Havana]]) founded in 1728.\n\n====Dominican Republic====\nIn the [[Dominican Republic]], it is known as \"Doctor en Medicina\" (Doctor in Medicine). In 1511 the Spanish Catholic church founded the first university of the Americas in Santo Domingo present capital of modern-day Dominican Republic and name it Universidad Santo Tomas de Aquino (today Universidad Autonoma de Santo Domingo). In 1630 this university graduated the first medical doctors of the Americas and amongst the graduates some Native Americans included.\n\n====Ecuador====\nIn Ecuador, medical school begins after graduating high-school. There are two options; applying to public or private universities. Both private and public university select their candidates based on entrance exams. Public universities are free while private universities cost around 6,000 - US$12,000 a year. In most universities, the carrier lasts for 6 years. After graduating, students obtain a degree of \u201cm\u00e9dico\u201d or \"m\u00e9dico cirujano\", depending which one is offered by each university. Both degrees are equivalent to doctor of medicine (MD).\n\n====France====\n{{Main|Medical school in France}}\nAfter graduating from high school with a [[Baccalaureat]], any student can register at a university of medicine (there are about 30 of them throughout the country). Until 2018, at the end of first year, an internal ranking examination took place in each of these universities in order to implement the ''[[numerus clausus]]'', this ranking examination and the ''[[numerus clausus]]'' has been abolished since. First year consists mainly of theoretical classes such as [[biophysics]] and [[biochemistry]], [[anatomy]], [[ethics]] or [[histology]]. Passing first year is commonly considered very challenging, requiring hard and continuous work. Each student can only try twice. For example, the [[Universit\u00e9 Ren\u00e9 Descartes]] welcomes about 2,000 students in first year and only 300 after ''numerus clausus''.\n\nThe second and third year are usually mainly quite theoretical although the teachings are often accompanied by placements in the field (e.g., internships as nurses or in the emergency room, depending on the university).\n\nDuring fourth, fifth and sixth years, medical students get a special status called \"''externe''\" (In some universities, such as Pierre et Marie Curie, the ''externe'' status is given starting in the third year). They work as interns every morning at the hospital plus a few night shifts a month and study in the afternoon. Each internship lasts between three and four months and takes place in a different department. Med students get five weeks off a year.\n\nAt the end of the sixth year, they need to pass a national ranking exam, which will determine their specialty. The first student gets to choose first, then the second, et cetera. Usually, students work hard during fifth and sixth years in order to train properly for the national ranking exam. During these years, actual practice at the hospital and some theoretical courses are meant to balance the training.\nSuch externs' average wage stands between 100 and 300 euros a month.\n\nAfter that ranking exams, students can start as residents in the specialty they have been able to pick. That is the point from which they also start getting paid.\n\nTowards the end of the medical program, French [[medical students]] are provided with more responsibilities and are required to defend a thesis; however, unlike a PhD thesis, no original research is actually necessary to write an MD thesis.  At the conclusion of the thesis defense, French medical students receive a State Diploma of Doctor of Medicine (MD, {{Lang-fr|dipl\u00f4me d'Etat de docteur en m\u00e9decine}}). Every new doctor must then proceed to a Diploma of Specialised Studies (DES, {{Lang-fr|dipl\u00f4me d'Etudes sp\u00e9cialis\u00e9es|links=no}}) to mark their specialty.  Some students may also receive a Diploma of Complementary Specialized Studies (DESC, {{Lang-fr|dipl\u00f4me d'Etudes sp\u00e9cialis\u00e9es compl\u00e9mentaires|links=no}}).<ref>{{cite web|title=University and degree systems in France|url=http://af-ksa.com/system/application/uploads/choose_france.pdf|publisher=Af-ksa.com|accessdate=2015-03-31|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151019031848/http://af-ksa.com/system/application/uploads/choose_france.pdf|archivedate=2015-10-19}}</ref>\n\n====Georgia====\nIn [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]], medical universities in Georgia offer a 6-year curriculum leading to award ''Doctor of Medicine (MD)'' \"Physician\" \"Medical Doctor (MD), a European medical degree which is valid throughout the world.

[[Texila American University]], Green Heart University, American International School of Medicine, [[Alexander American University]], [[Lincoln American University]] provides medicine programs.\n\n====Hungary====\nIn Hungary, after six years of medical school, which includes a sixth-year internship, students are awarded the degree of 'orvosdoktor' (Doctor of Medicine) degrees.\n\n====Indonesia====\nIn [[Indonesia]], the title of \"''dokter''\" (dr.) is awarded after 3-3.5 years of study (at least) and 1.5\u20132 years of clinical course in university hospitals. After a medical student finished those five years of study, they need to take \"Uji Kompetensi Mahasiswa Program Profesi Dokter\" (UKMPPD). If they pass the test, they can take Hippocrates Oath and the title of ''Dokter'' (dr.) is entitled before their name. Then they need to take a year-long internship course in primary health care clinics (also known as [[Puskesmas]]) or primary hospitals all over the country to practice as general practitioner under supervision of senior doctors. Those who wished to further their study into specialties can take graduate course of medicine of their preference and will be entitled with \"Specialist of ...\" after their name (e.g.: Sp.A for ''Spesialis Anak'' = Pediatrician). Graduate course of medicine is equal with residency program which is required the candidates to study for four years and hospital internship. Note that \"dr.\" is used for medical graduates, while Dr. (or wrongfully DR.), that is ''Doktor'' is used for [[Doctor of Philosophy|PhD]] holders.\n\n====Iran====\nIn [[Iran]], Medical education begins after high school. No pre-med course or BSc degree is required. The eligibility is determined through the rank applicants obtain in the public university entrance exam being held every year throughout the country. The entry to medical school is competitive and only students with the highest rank are accepted into medical program. The primary medical degree is completed in 7\u20137.5 years. On the final years (last 1\u20132 years) medical students need to do a research on a medical topic and provide thesis as part of their trainings. Medical graduates are awarded a certificate in general medicine, called \"Professional Doctorate in Medicine\" validated by the \"Ministry of Health and Medical Education of Iran\". All physicians will obtain license and medical council registration number from the \"Medical Council of Iran\" before they officially begin to practice. They may subsequently specialize in a specific medical field at medical schools offering the necessary qualifications.\n\n====Israel====\n{{See also|List_of_medical_schools_in_the_Middle_East#Israel|l1=List of medical schools in Israel}}\n\nThere are six university medical schools in Israel, including the [[Technion]] in Haifa, [[Ben Gurion University]] in Be'er Sheva, [[Tel Aviv University]], the [[Hebrew University]] in Jerusalem, the Medical school of the [[Bar-Ilan University]] in [[Safed]] and [[Ariel University]].

In this context, the new Laurea Magistrale a ciclo unico in Medicina e Chirurgia is a six-year second cycle degree, equivalent to a master's degree (360 ECTS credits) which can be earned in a six-year programme and requires a scientific research thesis. Consequently, the new medical degrees in Italy is considered to be equivalent to a [[Master's degree]] academically and legally.{{citation needed|date=March 2020}}\n\n====Latvia====\nIn Latvia, the duration of basic medical education is six years and the course leads to the degree of Doctor of Medicine.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rsu.lv/eng/study-here/undergraduate/medicine|title=Medical school|publisher=[[R\u012bga Stradi\u0146\u0161 University]]|language=en|access-date=30 July 2017}}</ref>\n\n====Malaysia====\nIn [[Malaysia]], MD are awarded by both private and public universities, mostly are trained as a 5-year course, however, with the establishment of Perdana University, it became the first university in Malaysia to provide a 4-year graduate entry course.

The  MD degree does not permit the practice of medicine but qualifies the degree-holder to apply for registration to the Professional Regulatory Commission. Registration to the Commission through completion of internship and examinations will grant the privilege of practicing medicine in the Philippines. Moreover, the licensed Physician has the option to proceed for medical specialization and the taking of diplomate board examinations conducted by the respective board of medical specialists in a particular field.\n\n====Poland====\nIn [[Poland]] the title of ''lekarz'' (physician, medical doctor) or \"lek.\" is granted after completing a 6-year medical program (students apply to it directly after graduating high school).<ref name=\"WHED\">{{cite web|url=http://www.euroeducation.net/prof/polaco.htm|title=The European Education Directory|author=|website=|publisher=EuroEducation Net|accessdate=2 July 2012}}</ref> Many medical schools in Poland also offer medicine programs in English, which award the Doctor of Medicine (MD) degree.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://search.wdoms.org/home/SchoolDetail/F0000048|title=School Detail|author=|date=|website=search.wdoms.org}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://search.wdoms.org/home/SchoolDetail/F0000411|title=School Detail|author=|date=|website=search.wdoms.org}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://search.wdoms.org/home/SchoolDetail/F0000871|title=School Detail|author=|date=|website=search.wdoms.org}}</ref> In contrast, a higher doctoral academic research degree in medicine resembling a PhD is named \"dr n. med.\" or ''doktor nauk medycznych'' (Doctor of Medical Sciences).

Both the Jessenius School of Medicine and the Faculty of Medicine in Ko\u0161ice has several international students. The Jessenius School of Medicine has almost a thousand international students, most from Norway.\n\nAdmission to the medical schools is based on entrance examination that can be undergone once a year. The program is a 6 year program in general medicine with a strictly preclinical and clinical division. The preclinical years are the two first, and are purely theoretical. They consist of subjects such as [[cell biology]], [[genetics]], [[biophysics]], [[medical chemistry]], [[anatomy]], [[biochemistry]], [[histology]], [[embryology]] and so on. From the third year onwards, the study is integrated with practical learning at the faculty\u2019s associated teaching hospital, including major multi-year subjects such [[internal medicine]], [[surgery]], [[pediatrics]], etc. In the sixth and final year, the student must pass four final state examinations and defend a self-composed thesis in order to graduate with a professional doctorate granting them the title of [[MUDr.]] for practicing in Slovakia or the Czech Republic or MD when practicing outside of Slovakia.\n\n====Slovenia====\nIn [[Slovenia]], the title of \"doktor medicine\" (abbreviated \"dr. med.\") is awarded upon completion of six years of study at one of the two Slovenian Faculties of Medicine (\"medicinska fakulteta\") in Ljubljana or Maribor. Studying at these faculties is only possible if the student has finished a gymnasium/grammar school (\"gimnazija\") with a general diploma called \"splo\u0161na matura\".\n\n====South Korea====\nIn South Korea, there is a Medical Doctor (MD) license.\n\nThe medical educations in South Korea (Republic of Korea) are 6 or 4 years in duration, 6-year courses starting right after high schools, and 4-year course starting after 4-year's university education (to start the 4-year course, the student needs a bachelor's degree).

Upon graduation, all medical students must pass national medical licensing examinations and a university-based comprehensive test. After medical school, newly graduated doctors are under contract to spend a year of internship and 2 years of tenure in rural areas before they are eligible for any other residency positions or specialized training. The students will receive Doctor of Medicine (MD) degree. However, the degree is equivalent to master's degree in Thailand. Specialty training after the MD degree requires at least 4\u20136 years residency program in the training university hospitals and must pass the board examination. Board-certified specialized degree is equivalent to doctorate degree.\n\n====Tunisia====\n{{More citations needed section|date=November 2009}}\nIn Tunisia, education is free for all Tunisian citizens and for foreigners who have scholarships. The oldest Medical school is a faculty of the University of Tunis.  There are four medicine faculties situated in the major cities of [[Tunis]], [[Sfax]], [[Sousse]] and [[Monastir, Tunisia|Monastir]]. Admission is bound to the success and score in the baccalaureate examination. Admission score threshold is very high, based on competition among all applicants throughout the nation. Medical school curriculum consists of five years.  The first two years are medical theory, containing all basic sciences related to medicine, and the last three years consists of clinical issues related to all medical specialties.  During these last three years, the student gets the status of \"Externe\". The student has to attend at the university hospital every day, rotating around all wards. Every period is followed by a clinical exam regarding the student's knowledge in that particular specialty.  After those five years, there are two years on internship, in which the student is a physician but under the supervision of the chief doctor; the student rotates over the major and most essential specialties during period of four months each. After that, student has the choice of either passing the residency national exam or extending his internship for another year, after which he gains the status of family physician. The residency program consists of four to five years in the specialty he qualifies, depending on his score in the national residency examination under the rule of highest score chooses first. Whether the student chooses to be a family doctor or a specialist, he has to write a doctoral thesis, which he will be defending in front of a jury, after which he gains his degree of ''Doctor of Medicine (MD)''.\n\n====Turkey====\nIn [[Turkey]], the title of \"T\u0131p Doktoru\" (literally \"Doctor of Medicine\")is awarded upon completion of six years continuous study started with five years university education include three years basic sciences, two years clinical courses followed by one year of internship in university hospitals.\n\n====Ukraine====\n{{See also|List of medical schools in Europe#Ukraine|l1=List of medical schools in Ukraine}}\nIn [[Ukraine]], by 2018, graduates of the school with completed secondary education that have cope with the relevant exams (in the disciplines designated by these universities) in the nationwide system for assessing graduates' knowledge - EIT ({{lang-uk|\u0417\u041d\u041e}}, [[External independent testing]]) based on the rating - may be admitted to the Medical Universities.<ref>[http://medforum.in.ua/partnery-vysshie-uchebnye-meditsinskie-zavedeniya-ukrainy/ \u0412\u0438\u0449\u0456 \u043d\u0430\u0432\u0447\u0430\u043b\u044c\u043d\u0456 \u043c\u0435\u0434\u0438\u0447\u043d\u0456 \u0437\u0430\u043a\u043b\u0430\u0434\u0438 \u0423\u043a\u0440\u0430\u0457\u043d\u0438]{{in lang|uk}}</ref>\n\nUkrainian medical universities offer a 6-year curriculum, which should end with the passing of the State Complex Examination.

Before graduating from a medical school and being awarded the Doctor of Medicine degree, students are required to take the [[United States Medical Licensing Examination]] (USMLE) Step 1 and both the clinical knowledge and clinical skills parts of Step 2. The MD degree is typically earned in four years. Following the awarding of the MD, physicians who wish to practice in the United States are required to complete at least one internship year (PGY-1) and pass the [[USMLE Step 3]]. In order to receive board eligible or board accredited status in a specialty of medicine such as [[general surgery]] or [[internal medicine]], physicians undergo additional specialized training in the form of a [[Residency (medicine)|residency]]. Those who wish to further specialize in areas such as [[cardiology]] or infectious diseases then complete a [[Fellowship (medicine)|fellowship]]. Depending upon the physician's chosen field, residencies and fellowships involve an additional three to eight years of training after obtaining the MD. This can be lengthened with additional research years, which can last one, two, or more years.{{Citation needed|date=October 2018}}\n\nEven though the M.D. is a [[professional degree]] and not a research doctorate (i.e., a Ph.D.), many holders of the M.D. degree conduct clinical and basic scientific [[research]] and publish in [[peer-reviewed journal]]s during training and after graduation; an academic physician whose work emphasizes basic research is called a [[physician-scientist]].

After completing these  years the student know how the human body is and how it works. Also, any extrinsic agent that can modify its functions. There is also Medical Exercise demonstration which included guided visit to primarily care centers during a complete semester or year-round depending on universities.\n\nDuring third year medical students start studying [[pharmacology]], [[pathology]] and [[physical examination]]. Passing successfully first, second and third year is commonly considered a filter, almost half of previously admitted students leave voluntarily.\n\nThe fourth year medical students enter on the field starting to visit hospitals and healthcare services. This is called Pre-Clinical Cycle were they acquire deep knowledge about clinical examination visiting specialized units such as Internal Medicine, Trauma and orthopedics, surgery and gynecology and obstetrics. They start to be member of a medical team. Every morning at the hospital, plus one night shifts per week, and lectures in the afternoon. Each internship lasts between six and four months and takes place in a different department.\n\nThe fifth and sixth year are very similar but this time they applied their previously earned clinical knowledge and skills starting to follow patients independently. At the end of the sixth year, they need to pass a highly supervised medical practice examination in an unserved outpatient center or specialized hospital in order to earn the degree. During these years, there is training at the hospital almost exclusively. Very little theoretical courses are meant to balance the training. Once completed they earn a university degree and a title granted by the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela as \"Medical Surgeon\" this is considered equivalent to a M.D degree.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fmed.luz.edu.ve/index.php?option=com_content&task=category&sectionid=3&id=36&Itemid=264|title=University of Zulia Medical Program Overview|publisher=University of Zulia|format=PHP|accessdate=2019-02-22|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190223074307/http://www.fmed.luz.edu.ve/index.php?option=com_content&task=category&sectionid=3&id=36&Itemid=264|archive-date=2019-02-23|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nThere is also a five years program the \"M\u00e9dico Integral Comunitario\" title and degree granted by newly created universities and headed by Cuban nationals from the Cuba - Venezuela cooperation agreements.<ref name=Torres2018/> This program has been subject of controversy in the country over the legitimacy of the Cuban doctors' licensure for teaching and practice medicine.<ref>[http://buscador.eluniversal.com/2003/09/11/ccs_art_11277B.shtml \"Sobre Plan Barrio Adentro: Rangel Avalos reitera desacato a decisi\u00f3n de Corte\"] ''El Universal''</ref><ref>[http://buscador.eluniversal.com/2003/11/12/pol_art_12108C.shtml \"Sala Constitucional se neg\u00f3 a pronunciarse sobre ejercicio de m\u00e9dicos cubanos: Gobierno deber\u00e1 llevar caso Barrio Adentro a otra instancia\"] ''El Universal''</ref><ref>[http://buscador.eluniversal.com/2003/08/23/ccs_art_23272BB.shtml \"Desacato al amparo acarrear\u00e1 sanciones jur\u00eddicas\"] ''El Universal''</ref>\n\nAfter graduation, recently graduate doctors acquire the right to use Dr. before their names but still must follow a one-year exercise in the countryside or a two years training in a specialized hospital.

Upon recognition by Bhutan Health and Medical council, they work as medical doctor in country. M.D title is usually given to those who completes 3 to 4 years of residency for specialised course like surgery, medicine pediatrics, etc.\n\n====India====\nThe MBBS (Bachelor of Medicine/Bachelor of Surgery) degree represents the first (undergraduate) level of training required to be licensed as a physician (other degrees in alternative medicine are present like BAMS, BHMS, BSMS etc.) and the MS or MD degree is a postgraduate degree, representative of speciality training. The equivalent training in the US or Canada would be the completion of a medical (post-graduate) degree. Eligibility for the MS or MD course is restricted to medical graduates holding the MBBS degree.\n\nThe MBBS course is for five and a half years, and training imparted is as follows:\n\n# Pre-clinical (Anatomy, Physiology, and Biochemistry)\n# Para-clinical (Pathology, Microbiology, Pharmacology, Forensic Medicine and Community Medicine)\n# Clinical (Ophthalmology, Otorhinolaryngology, General Medicine, General Surgery, Pediatrics and Obstetrics/Gynecology; with speciality rotations such as Orthopaedics, Radiology, etc.).\n\nAfter three years of study and the successful completion of an examination, which includes both theoretical and practical elements, in a pre-clinical or clinical subject of a non-surgical nature [e.g. Anatomy (since the subject deals with study of anatomy through dissecting cadavers, thus given an MD degree), Physiology, Pharmacology, Internal Medicine, Pediatrics, Pathology, Microbiology] the candidate receives MD degree, whereas in a clinical subject of a surgical nature (e.g. General Surgery, Orthopaedics, Obstetrics/Gynaecology, Ophthalmology), the candidate receives the equivalent degree [[Master of Surgery]] (MS).\n\nA second alternate qualification termed DNB [Diplomate of National Board], is considered equivalent to the MD and MS degrees. This can be obtained by passing the exam conducted by the [[National Board of Examinations]] after completing 3 years of post-MBBS residency training in teaching hospitals recognised by the board. The College of Physicians & Surgeons of Bombay, India (Established 1912) also awards higher postgraduate degrees in clinical and pre-clinical specialities, called FCPS; it involves three years of study and the successful completion of an examination, which includes both theoretical and practical elements, and a research thesis and a viva. The FCPS is representative of speciality clinical training, and equivalent to MD/MS/DNB/Ph.D Medical in Medical Doctorate in other parts of the world. Until 2007, the Government of India and the Medical Council of India recognised the FCPS qualification - since then, this is being done by State Medical Councils.\n\nAfter obtaining the first postgraduate degree, that is MD/MS/FCPS/DNB/Ph.D Medical, one can go for further specialisation in medical or surgical fields. This involves a highly competitive entrance examination. This course has three years of additional training and requires the submission of a dissertation (thesis). This is considered a clinical doctorate as the focus is on preparing a super-specialist with adequate clinical as well as research training. After the dissertation is approved and the exit examination (theory and practical) is cleared, the degree awarded is DM (Doctor of Medicine), Ph.D Medical . Based on the specific field of training, the degree awarded is DM in Cardiac Anaesthesia, Cardiology, Neurology, Nephrology, Gastroenterology, Neuroradiology, Critical Care, Pulmonology, Hematology, Medical Oncology, Clinical Pharmacology, Pediatric Critical Care, Pediatric Neurology, Neonataology, Pediatric Gastroenterology, Neuroanaesthesia, etc. For surgical superspecialities the degree awarded is MCh (Magister Chirurgiae), like MCh in Cardio-thoracic and Vascular Surgery, Endocrine Surgery, Neurosurgery, Surgical Gastroenterology, Urology, Plastic Surgery, Pediatric Surgery etc. DM and MCh are the clinical equivalent of a Doctorate degree.  A third alternate qualification is DNB (superspecialties), offered by [[National Board of Examinations]], like DNB in Cardiology, Neurology, Cardiac Surgery, Neurosurgery.\n\nFollowing DM or MCh, one can further go for postdoctoral fellowship programs of one-year duration in specific subspecialties like Cardiac Electrophysiology, Invasive cardiology, Pediatric cardiology, Epilepsy, stroke, electroencephalography, movement disorders, neuromuscular disorders, cerebrovascular surgery, skull base surgery, neurocritical care, pediatric cardiac surgery etc. offered by prestigious government institutes and abroad.\n\n====Pakistan====\n\nIn [[Pakistan]] the MD is a higher doctorate, awarded by medical universities based on successful completion of a residency program of four to six years' duration in a university hospital. Many universities are offering MD. Parallel to MD, MS is a higher doctorate awarded on successful completion of four to six years' duration of a residency program in surgical field.\n\n====Sri Lanka====\nIn [[Sri Lanka]], the MD degree is a higher postgraduate degree that is awarded by the Postgraduate Institute of Medicine after completion of a postgraduate course, examinations and speciality training. The MD degree in Sri Lanka is representative of specialty training in clinical, para clinical, and preventive medicine (e.g., general medicine, cardiology, nephrology, oncology, para clinical such as microbiology, haematology and preventive such as community medicine). Entry for the MD course is open only for medical graduates holding the MBBS degree (with a duration of five and a half years), and training is obtained in medical disciplines that are non-surgical in nature (e.g., internal medicine, radiology, pathology, etc.) After three or four years of study and the successful completion of an examination with written as well as cases and via examinations, the MD degree in the respective field of study is awarded. In community medicine and medical administration, part I examination consists of a theoretical exam while the degree is conferred after completion of a thesis as a PhD. This thesis has to be completed within a period of five years. After successfully defending the academic thesis, the MD degree is conferred to the candidate. The MD degree holder is certified as a board certified specialist by the respective board of study of the Postgraduate Institute of Medicine after he or she undergoes 2\u20134 years of local and foreign training depending on the specialty/subspecialty selected.\n\nIn [[Ayurveda]], [[Bachelor of Ayurveda, Medicine and Surgery]] [[Bachelor of Ayurveda, Medicine and Surgery|B.A.M.S.]] in [[Unani medicine|Unani]], Bachelor of Unani Medicine and Surgery BUMS in [[Siddha medicine|Sidha]], Bachelor of Sidha Medicine and Surgery BSMS are the basic qualification for practicing Ayurveda, Unani,&Sidha. The [[Bachelor of Ayurveda, Medicine and Surgery|B.A.M.S.]], B.U.M.S., and B.S.M.S. are 6-year degree (including internship) courses accepted by the [[University Grants Commission (Sri Lanka)]]. M.D (Ayu)([[Ayurveda vachaspati]]) can be done after [[Bachelor of Ayurveda, Medicine and Surgery|B.A.M.S.]], as a specialty, and it takes 3 years (including submission of a thesis) to complete the course. Ayurveda M.D (Ayu) (Ayurveda vachaspati) is a master's degree accepted by [[University Grants Commission (Sri Lanka)]], after completion of [[MPhil]] can follow [[Ph.D.]]-level programmes in [[Sri Lanka]].\n\n===Research degrees===\n====United Kingdom, Ireland and some Commonwealth countries====\nThe entry-level first professional degree in these countries for the practice of medicine is that of [[Bachelor of Medicine and Surgery|Bachelor of Medicine and Bachelor of Surgery]] (MBBS, MB, MB BCh BAO, BMBS, MBBChir, or MBChB). This degree typically requires between four and six years of study and clinical training, and is equivalent to the North American MD degree. Due to the UK code for higher education, first degrees in medicine comprise an integrated programme of study and professional practice spanning several levels. These degrees may retain, for historical reasons, \"Bachelor of Medicine, Bachelor of Surgery\" and are abbreviated to MBChB, MBBS or BMBS.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.qaa.ac.uk/en/Publications/Documents/Framework-Higher-Education-Qualifications-08.pdf|title=The framework for higher education qualifications in England, Wales and Northern Ireland|publisher=Qaa.ac.uk|accessdate=2015-03-31|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150513125305/http://www.qaa.ac.uk/en/Publications/Documents/Framework-Higher-Education-Qualifications-08.pdf|archive-date=2015-05-13|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nIn the UK, Ireland and many [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] countries, the MD is a postgraduate research degree in medicine. At some universities, this takes the form of a first doctorate, analogous to the Ph.D., awarded upon submission of a thesis and a successful ''viva''. The thesis may consist of new research undertaken on a full- or part-time basis, with much less supervision (in the UK) than for a Ph.D., or a portfolio of previously published work.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.otago.ac.nz/courses/qualifications/md.html|title=Doctor of Medicine (MD), University of Otago, New Zealand|date=|publisher=Otago.ac.nz|accessdate=2015-03-31}}</ref>\n\nIn order to be eligible to apply for an MD degree from a UK or Commonwealth University one must hold either a \"Bachelor of Medicine, Bachelor of Surgery\" (MBBS, MBChB, BMBS for example) degree, or an equivalent U.S.-MD degree and must usually have at least five years of postgraduate experience. Therefore, graduates from the MBBS/MBChB/BMBS degrees do not hold doctorates; however, physicians holding these degrees are referred to as \"doctor\" as they are fully licensed as medical practitioners. In some commonwealth nations, these interns are designated as \"house officers\".\n\nAt some other universities (especially older institutions, such as [[University of Oxford|Oxford]], [[University of Dublin|Dublin]], [[University of Cambridge|Cambridge]] and [[University of St Andrews|St Andrews]], but also the relatively new [[James Cook University]]<ref>{{cite web |title=Higher Doctorate Degrees |url=https://www.jcu.edu.au/course-and-subject-handbook-2017/general-information/higher-doctorate-degrees |website=www.jcu.edu.au |publisher=James Cook University |accessdate=14 March 2020 |language=en-AU |date=26 March 2018}}</ref>), the MD is a [[higher doctorate]] (similar to a [[DSc]]) awarded upon submission of a portfolio of published work representing a substantial contribution to medical research.<ref name=\"hawkins\">CF Hawkins, \"Write the MD Thesis\" in \"How To Do It\" London: British Medical Association 2nd ed. 1985 {{ISBN|0-7279-0186-9}}</ref> The University of Cambridge has introduced a new degree of MedScD (more akin to the ScD degree) awarded on the basis of a career's contribution to the science or art of medicine, rather than a thesis, for which a candidate may be awarded the MD degree.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.admin.cam.ac.uk/reporter/2011-12/weekly/6248/section6.shtml|title=Reports - Cambridge University Reporter 6248|date=2011-12-07|publisher=Admin.cam.ac.uk|accessdate=2013-07-15}}</ref> Oxford did not do the same but instead demoted the rank of the degree the same level as the DPhil but retaining its original academic dress.\n\nIn the case where the MD is awarded (either as a first or higher doctorate) for previously published research, the candidate is usually required to be either a graduate or a full-time member of staff, of several years' standing of the university in question.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.uq.edu.au/study/program.html?acad_prog=7504|title=Courses and Programs - The University of Queensland, Australia|publisher=Uq.edu.au|accessdate=2015-03-31|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150402104439/http://www.uq.edu.au/study/program.html?acad_prog=7504|archive-date=2015-04-02|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n===Equivalent degrees in other countries===<!-- PLEASE keep in ALPHABETICAL ORDER -->\n*In [[Bangladesh]], the basic medical degree is the MBBS. After completing the intermediate level of education (12 years) the candidate must undergo 5 years of medical training in any medical college to achieve the MBBS degree. After obtaining the degree, the candidate needs to undergo one year of internship to obtain BMDC (Bangladesh medical and dental council) accreditation in order to practice in the country.\n*In [[mainland China]], some medical schools award MBBS to foreign students while all medical schools award Bachelor of Medicine to nationals. Some MD degrees are higher academic research degrees.\n*In [[Colombia]], the medicine faculties of the universities awards the title of \"Medico Cirujano\" after taking 12 semesters of studies on  \"all clinic and surgery discipline a two semester on internship. After receiving the degree there is a mandatory year \"obliged social work\" were the doctors practice as GP in the countryside. Residency programs last between 3\u20134 years depends on the specialty.\n*The [[Czech Republic|Czech]] and [[Slovakia|Slovak]] title MUDr. (Medicinae Universae doctor or ''doktor medic\u00edny'') is a professional doctorate granted upon completion of six years pregraduate Master's study at medical schools. The postgraduate academic research degree in medicine is a PhD degree.\n*The [[Denmark|Danish]] and [[Norway|Norwegian]] [[Candidatus medicinae]] or [[Candidata medicinae]] degrees (cand. med.) is awarded after completing a six-year medical programme, to which students apply directly upon finishing secondary school. The programme usually includes a small thesis. However, the cand. med. degree must not be confused with the previous Danish and Norwegian [[Doctor Medicinae (Danish and Norwegian degree)|Dr. Med.]] degree, which is a separate degree from the Ph.D. and represents a higher degree of medical research experience. It typically consists of at least 5\u20136 original publications.\n*In [[Finland]], the duration of basic medical education is six years and the course leads to the degree of Licentiate of Medicine.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.oulu.fi/studiesarchive2013/5-6-year-degree-programmes-2013-2014/licentiate-medicine-md-0|title=Medicine, Medical licentiate|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=[[University of Oulu]]|language=fi|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191216132215/https://www.oulu.fi/studiesarchive2013/5-6-year-degree-programmes-2013-2014/licentiate-medicine-md-0|archive-date=16 December 2019|access-date=30 July 2017}}</ref>\n*In [[Greece]], after a six-year study, a medical student acquires his medical degree and the right to use \"\u0394\u03c1.\", (Dr.) before his name. This is considered equivalent to the MD title.\n*In [[Kosovo]], there are medical high schools. Students from elementary school can choose to attend the medical high school, which lasts 3 years. When they finish the 3 years of medical high school, they practice for 4 months. After that, they can be a nurse or they can go to medical facilities in Pristina, with the education there taking around 6 years, including practice, to become a doctor.\n*In [[Mexico]] and [[Peru]], schools of medicine award the \"T\u00edtulo de M\u00e9dico Cirujano\" degree after completing either six or seven years of study. This curriculum includes a rotating internship year and a year of social service providing care to an underserved community.\n*In [[Nepal]], a MBBS degree is awarded. This is an undergraduate level degree, which is awarded after completion of four and half years of medical school followed by one year of clinical internship. Most medical schools also offer postgraduate M.D and M.S. degrees, which requires three years of further training. Post-doctorate D.M. and M.Ch. terminal degrees are awarded by a few elite institutions after three more years of super-speciality training.\n*In the [[Netherlands]], medical students receive six years of university education prior to their graduation. Prospective students can apply for medical education directly after finishing the highest level of secondary school, [[voorbereidend wetenschappelijk onderwijs|vwo]]; previous undergraduate education is not a precondition for admittance. Medical students receive three years of preclinical training, followed by three years of clinical training (''co-assistentschappen'', or ''co-schappen'') in hospitals. At one medical faculty ([[Utrecht University]]), clinical training already begins in the third year of medical school. After 6 years, students graduate as ''Basisartsen'' (\"base physician\"). As a result of the [[Bologna process]], medical students in the Netherlands receive a [[Bachelor of Science|bachelor's degree (BSc)]] concluding successfully three years of medical university curriculum, and a [[Master of Science|master's degree (MSc)]] upon successful graduation. After graduation, physicians can apply for, and complete a R&D based doctorate, earning them a [[Doctor of Philosophy|PhD in Medicine]]. Contrary to popular (international) daily use, the title \"MD\" does not exist, is not granted, nor recognised for Dutch physicians. Furthermore, no specific notation signifying [[Medical license|board registration]] exists for physicians in the Netherlands.\n*In [[Belgium]], Belgian medical education is much more based on theoretical knowledge than the Dutch system. In the first three years, which are very theoretical and lead to a university bachelor's degree, general scientific courses are taken such as chemistry, biophysics, physiology, biostatistics, anatomy, virology, etc. To enter the bachelor course in [[Flanders]], prospective students have to pass an exam, as a result of the ''numerus clausus''. After the bachelor courses, students are allowed to enter the 'master in medicine' courses, which consist of three years of theoretical and clinical study. In general, the first two master years are very theoretical and teach the students human pathology, diseases and pharmacology.  The third year is a year full of internships in a wide range of specialities in different clinics. The seventh, final year serves as a kind of 'pre-specialization' year in which the students are specifically trained in the specialty they wish to pursue after medical school. This contrasts with the Dutch approach, in which graduates are literally 'basic doctors' (''basisartsen'') who have yet to decide on a specialty.\n*In [[Portugal]], to practice medicine, a master's degree in medicine (awarded after a 6-year Integrated master's program in medicine) is mandatory. Before the 2007 Bologna Process, the same course was only a Licentiate Degree. After the 6-year program, students must go through the National Seriation Exam (''Prova Nacional de Seria\u00e7\u00e3o''), and then a year of General Medical Internship (''Ano Comum''). When the internship ends, the students are placed in their choice of Medical Specialty, according to their ranking in the aforementioned Exam and the vacancies available for each medical specialty. Only when each student finishes the Medical Internship, will they be allowed to practice medicine without supervision. Entry to the Integrated Masters Program in Medicine is done directly after High School, based on the student's grade - each year there are about 1800 new Medical Students in Portugal, in 8 different Medical Schools.\n*In [[Sudan]] the awarded degree in most of the medical schools is, Bachelor of Medicine and Basic Surgery (MBBS). In schools that are based on the English system of medical teaching, the degree is granted after six years of studying. As for the schools that are adopting the American system, they grant their students the degree of MBBS in only five years.\n*In Sweden, medical education begins with a five-and-a-half-year undergraduate university program leading to the degree \"Master of Science in Medicine\" ({{lang-sv|L\u00e4karexamen}}). Following this, the [[National Board of Health and Welfare (Sweden)|National Board of Health and Welfare]] requires a minimum of 18 months of clinical internship ({{lang-sv|Allm\u00e4ntj\u00e4nstg\u00f6ring}}) before granting a medical license ({{lang-sv|L\u00e4karlegitimation}}) to be fully qualified as the Swedish equivalent to Medical Doctor (MD).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.socialstyrelsen.se/applicationforswedishlicencetopractiseothercountries/doctorofmedicine|title=License to practice medicine in Sweden|publisher=Socialstyrelsen.se|accessdate=2015-03-31|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150321033725/http://www.socialstyrelsen.se/applicationforswedishlicencetopractiseothercountries/doctorofmedicine|archive-date=2015-03-21|url-status=dead}}</ref> This internship consists of surgery (3\u20136 months), internal medicine (3\u20136 months), psychiatry (three months) and family medicine (six months). Upon receiving a license to practice, a physician is able to apply for a post to start specialist training. There are currently 52 recognised medical specialties in Sweden. The specialist training has a duration of minimum five years, which upon completion grants formal qualification as a specialist.\n\n===Other postgraduate clinical degrees===\nThere is also a similar advanced professional degree to the postgraduate MD: the [[Master of Surgery]] (usually ChM or MS, but [[MCh]] in Scotland, Ireland, Wales and at Oxford and MChir at Cambridge). The equivalence of these degrees, but their differing names, prevents the need for surgeons (addressed as Mr. in the UK) having to revert to the title Dr., which they once held as new MBBS graduates.\n\nIn Ireland, where the basic medical qualification includes a degree in obstetrics, there is a similar higher degree of Master of the Art of Obstetrics (MAO). A Master of Midwifery was formerly examined by the [[Worshipful Society of Apothecaries of London]] (hence MMSA) but fell into abeyance in the 1960s; in this case, the term Master referred not to a university degree but rather a professional rank that is common among craft guilds.\n\nIn [[East Africa]], the medical schools in [[Kenya]], [[Tanzania]] and [[Uganda]] award the degree of [[Master of Medicine]] (MMed) degree in both surgical and medical specialty disciplines following a three to six-year period of instruction.\n\nIn West Africa, the West African College of Physicians and the West African College of Surgeons award the Fellowship of the West African College of Physicians (FWACP) and the Fellowship of the West African College of Surgeons (FWACS) in medical and surgical disciplines respectively after a minimum of four-year residency training period.\n\nThe [[Osteopathic medicine in the United States|Doctor of Osteopathic Medicine]] or [[Doctor of Osteopathic Medicine|DO]] degree allows the same practice rights in the United States and Canada to the MD degree and Doctors of Osteopathic Medicine are fully licensed physicians. Holders of the MD degree must pass MD level board exams while DO holders can pass either the DO (COMLEX) exam or MD exam (USMLE).<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.usmle.org/bulletin/eligibility/|title=United States Medical Licensing Examination {{!}} USMLE Bulletin {{!}} Eligibility|website=www.usmle.org|language=en|access-date=2018-06-27}}</ref> Similarly, MDs must attend MD rated residency and fellowship programs while DOs can attend either MD programs or Osteopathic (DO) programs.

On the advice of Bauer, the Ambassador of the Holy See, Voiello decides a new pope must be elected to prevent Pius XIII from becoming a [[Idolatry|false idol]]. Realizing the [[papal conclave]] is unwilling to elect him, he and allies engage in tactical voting to prevent his opponent Cardinal Hern\u00e1ndez from being selected. They instead elect the mild-mannered Cardinal Viglietti, a devout follower of [[Francis of Assisi]], hoping to influence him by proxy. Adopting the name Pope Francis II, Viglietti quickly acclimates to his power and introduces radical charitable reforms to the church, such as allowing masses of [[European migrant crisis|refugees]] shelter in the Vatican, taking full control of the [[Vatican Archives]] and finances with the intent of giving them away, and compelling the [[College of Cardinals]] to surrender their valuables. The reforms, plus Viglietti\u2019s intent to [[defrock]] Voiello, cause the latter and Hern\u00e1ndez to plot to replace him with the more moderate Sir John Brannox, who was the third preference in the election. Pope Francis II suffers an apparent heart attack and dies, implied to have been orchestrated by Bauer.

A member of British [[aristocracy]] and admirer of [[John Henry Newman]], Brannox is renowned in the church for the conversion of [[Anglicans]] to Catholicism and for a theological text, The Middle Way, published in his youth. The cardinals believe this centrist philosophy will restore order to the Vatican after the death of Francis II and the state of Pius XIII. Upon arrival at the Brannox estate, the group are shown to their bedrooms, where each of them (as well as Brannox) feels the presence of Pius XIII. In the Vatican, Sofia\u2019s husband Tomas meets with the [[Italian Minister of Economy and Finance]] and Cardinal Spalletta, who reveals he will be able to manipulate Brannox as he knows his one and only secret. The next morning, Voiello meets with Brannox, who reveals his elderly parents live in a separate wing as to never see him, believing him guilty for the death of his twin, Adam, whom they mourn daily. The group is taken aback by Brannox\u2019s eccentricity and candidness, but a later meal where the cardinal expands on his philosophy cements their decision to select him.

He tells them he resents them for their contempt, and that he deserves to be pope because of that. Despite this, in the morning, he informs the others of his decision to decline the offer. However, Voiello manages to persuade him and they all return to Rome, where Brannox is elected Pope John Paul III and has his first homily. In financial hardship, Esther is introduced to Fabiano, a single man, and they begin a sexual relationship. Fabiano later informs Esther that a mother is paying good money for a woman to engage in sexual intercourse with her son Attanasio, who has physical deformities. Esther is initially irritated by the proposal, but she goes to see the son, only to run shortly after undressing. The Abbess and Sister Lisette ask Cavallo for money to allow Lisette to accompany her ill mother to Lourdes before she dies; Cavallo pretends to help them, but actually ignores their request. The pope addresses the cardinals, saying that tenderness has to be preferred over passion and that the Church has to learn how to love properly.

Voiello receives the Abbess and Sister Lisette, the leader of the strike, to hear them out, but advises them not to make an enemy of him; they later ask for a meeting with the Holy Father. Pope John Paul visits Pope Pius in Venice; when he leaves the hospital, the leader of a vigil for Pius XIII stops him and whispers in his ear.

Spalletta then argues that due to his secretive [[Niccolo Machiavelli#Beliefs|Machiavellianism]], Voiello should be replaced as Secretary of State.

Despite refuting her claims, he still prays desperately for the disabled boy and encourages the couple to rekindle their relationship. Pius XIII's idolatric following splits, with a faction led by Esther believing he has been killed. A terror attack (which Faisal is implied to be a part of) takes place in [[St Peters Basilica]] which kills John Paul III's dog, causing him to fall into a deep depression. Sofia seeks the retired Voiello's advice on the fragile pope's state and is told to ride his weakness. John Paul III confesses to Guti\u00e9rrez that he is a drug addict, and more importantly that he [[plagiarized]] The Middle Way from his dead twin brother's work. \n|LineColor = FF549F\n}}\n{{Episode list\n|EpisodeNumber = 8\n|Title = Episode 8\n|DirectedBy = Paolo Sorrentino\n|WrittenBy = Paolo Sorrentino & Umberto Contarello & Stefano Bises\n|OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2020|1|31|df=yes}}\n|Viewers = 0.25 {{small|({{abbr|o.n.|overnight}})}}<ref name=\"ratings7-8\" />\n|ShortSummary = Bauer meets with Voiello, informing him Pius XIII has awoken and that they need to restore the weak John Paul III in order to return the Vatican to strength, as his practices help divert attention from the churches scandals. He warns of the likelihood of another terror attack from the Caliph, and implies the death of Francis II was caused by the comatose pontiff. John Paul III retreats to the [[Alps]] and is met by Sofia, who reveals leaked photos of him as a [[Punk subculture|punk]] in his youth in ''[[Vanity Fair (magazine)|Vanity Fair]]'' have restored public opinion of him despite his behaviour in the interview and after the terror attack. He divulges to her how his brother, Adam, died in a [[skiing]] accident, and how he was unable to save him due to being high on [[heroin]]. Voiello returns as Secretary of State, as Assente is forced to resign following a remark regarding orphaned children, as well as being entrapped into revealing his [[homosexuality]] . Bauer and Essence put and end to Spalletta, Altbruck and Guicciardini's blackmail of John Paull III. Pius XIII returns to Rome in secret, and plans his public comeback with Voiello in addition to voicing his anger at the Caliphs attacks on the church. He also meets with the nuns and promises moderate reform. Voiello's friend Girolamo dies, and receives an elaborate Vatican funeral. Voiello advises John Paul III that Pius XIII cannot remain an [[emeritus]], and the two must meet to discuss the future in person. \n\n|LineColor = FF549F\n}}\n{{Episode list\n|EpisodeNumber = 9\n|Title = Episode 9\n|DirectedBy = Paolo Sorrentino\n|WrittenBy = Paolo Sorrentino & Umberto Contarello & Stefano Bises\n|OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2020|2|7|df=yes}}\n|Viewers = 0.22 {{small|({{abbr|o.n.|overnight}})}}<ref>{{cite news|language=it|last=Stefanelli|first=Stefania|title=Ascolti TV \u2013 Venerd\u00ec 7 febbraio 2020.

A hostage crisis emerges at a Catholic elementary school on [[Ventotene]]. Pius XIII and John Paul III meet to discuss the matter, believing the caliphate is to blame. A furious Pius XIII proposes the papacy come down hard on the perpetrators and threatens to reveal himself to the world, robbing the caliphate of their monopoly on [[religious fanaticism]] and potentially starting a new [[religious war]]. He gains the support of the cardinals in secret, and convinces John Paul III to echo his sentiments publicly, but this results in a hostage being executed. Bauer forces a meeting between Voiello and a senior member of the caliphate, who informs the cardinal they are not behind the hostage crisis. A regretful Pius XIII meets with John Paul III, who surprisingly [[abdication|abdicates]] and returns home, fulfilling his wish to be forgotten. Pius XIII, now back in power, visits the school accompanied by [[Divisione Investigazioni Generali e Operazioni Speciali|DIGOS]] officers. The perpetrators then unveil themselves as his idolaters, including Esther, and are arrested. In [[St. Peter's Square]], Pius XIII gives a speech exulting The Middle Way, remarking such an approach should simply be the way of the church. He then interacts with the crowd but dies peacefully whilst being paraded back to St. Peters Basilica. Ewa Novak is pregnant with another child. Sister Lisette is able to visit her dying mother. Sister Caterina gives birth to her baby and leaves the nunnery, reuniting with a released Faisal. Back in England, Pope Emeritus John Paul III is finally re-embraced by his parents and is later visited by Sofia. Voiello succeeds Pius XIII as the new pope, having adopted Esther's child. \n|LineColor = FF549F\n}}\n}}\n\n==Production==\n''The New Pope'' production began in [[Italy]] in late 2018.<ref>{{cite web|last=Loughrey|first=Clarisse|title=''The Young Pope'' to get follow-up series called ''The New Pope''|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/films/news/the-young-pope-the-new-pope-a7739921.html|work=[[The Independent]]|date=17 May 2017|accessdate=28 August 2017}}</ref> Filming took place inside [[St. Peter's Basilica]] in [[Vatican City]] in November 2018.

On the advice of Bauer, the Ambassador of the Holy See, Voiello decides a new pope must be elected to prevent Pius XIII from becoming a [[Idolatry|false idol]]. Realizing the [[papal conclave]] is unwilling to elect him, he and allies engage in tactical voting to prevent his opponent Cardinal Hern\u00e1ndez from being selected. They instead elect the mild-mannered Cardinal Viglietti, a devout follower of [[Francis of Assisi]], hoping to influence him by proxy. Adopting the name Pope Francis II, Viglietti quickly acclimates to his power and introduces radical charitable reforms to the church, such as allowing masses of [[European migrant crisis|refugees]] shelter in the Vatican, taking full control of the [[Vatican Archives]] and finances with the intent of giving them away, and compelling the [[College of Cardinals]] to surrender their valuables. The reforms, plus Viglietti\u2019s intent to [[defrock]] Voiello, cause the latter and Hern\u00e1ndez to plot to replace him with the more moderate Sir John Brannox, who was the third preference in the election. Pope Francis II suffers an apparent heart attack and dies, implied to have been orchestrated by Bauer.

The cardinals believe this centrist philosophy will restore order to the Vatican after the death of Francis II and the state of Pius XIII. Upon arrival at the Brannox estate, the group are shown to their bedrooms, where each of them (as well as Brannox) feels the presence of Pius XIII. In the Vatican, Sofia\u2019s husband Tomas meets with the [[Italian Minister of Economy and Finance]] and Cardinal Spalletta, who reveals he will be able to manipulate Brannox as he knows his one and only secret. The next morning, Voiello meets with Brannox, who reveals his elderly parents live in a separate wing as to never see him, believing him guilty for the death of his twin, Adam, whom they mourn daily. The group is taken aback by Brannox\u2019s eccentricity and candidness, but a later meal where the cardinal expands on his philosophy cements their decision to select him. Brannox informs them he will have a decision by morning. In the Vatican, a television broadcasts an anti-Christian message from an unknown Islamic [[caliphate]] before turning off. \n|LineColor = FF549F\n}}\n{{Episode list\n|EpisodeNumber = 3\n|Title = Episode 3\n|DirectedBy = Paolo Sorrentino\n|WrittenBy = Paolo Sorrentino & Umberto Contarello & Stefano Bises\n|OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2020|1|17|df=yes}}\n|Viewers = N/A\n|ShortSummary = Brannox discusses the possibility of being pope with Sofia and Guti\u00e9rrez. He later speaks to his parents, noting how ironic it is that their preferred long-gone son Adam could not become a prominent ecclesiastic figure, while he, the disgraced son, is now offered the highest position in the Church. He tells them he resents them for their contempt, and that he deserves to be pope because of that. Despite this, in the morning, he informs the others of his decision to decline the offer. However, Voiello manages to persuade him and they all return to Rome, where Brannox is elected Pope John Paul III and has his first homily. In financial hardship, Esther is introduced to Fabiano, a single man, and they begin a sexual relationship. Fabiano later informs Esther that a mother is paying good money for a woman to engage in sexual intercourse with her son Attanasio, who has physical deformities. Esther is initially irritated by the proposal, but she goes to see the son, only to run shortly after undressing. The Abbess and Sister Lisette ask Cavallo for money to allow Lisette to accompany her ill mother to Lourdes before she dies; Cavallo pretends to help them, but actually ignores their request. The pope addresses the cardinals, saying that tenderness has to be preferred over passion and that the Church has to learn how to love properly.

Voiello receives the Abbess and Sister Lisette, the leader of the strike, to hear them out, but advises them not to make an enemy of him; they later ask for a meeting with the Holy Father. Pope John Paul visits Pope Pius in Venice; when he leaves the hospital, the leader of a vigil for Pius XIII stops him and whispers in his ear.

John Paul III meets Spalletta, who explains the situation is to please Guicciardini, who is protecting the church by convincing the [[Prime Minister of Italy|Prime Minister]] to postpone new laws, which include a proposed [[Ex post facto law|retroactive]] tax on church buildings. Spalletta then argues that due to his secretive [[Niccolo Machiavelli#Beliefs|Machiavellianism]], Voiello should be replaced as Secretary of State. John Paul III meets Voiello and suggests he resigns. In response, Voiello first transfers Cardinal Hernandez to a [[missionary]] posting in [[Kabul]], and then meets the nuns and grants their wishes before resigning and being replaced by Assente.

It has been used as an academic title in Europe since the 13th century, when the first doctorates were awarded at the [[University of Bologna]] and the [[University of Paris]]. Having become established in European [[universities]], this usage spread around the world. Contracted \"Dr\" or \"Dr.\", it is used as a designation for a person who has obtained a [[doctorate]] (e.g. [[Doctor of Philosophy|PhD]]). In many parts of the world it is also used by medical practitioners, regardless of whether or not they hold a doctoral-level degree.\n\n==Origins==\nThe doctorate ({{lang-la|doce\u014d|lit=I teach}}) appeared in [[Middle Ages|medieval Europe]] as a license to teach ({{lang-la|licentia docendi|links=no}}) at a [[medieval university]].<ref name=\"Lexikon des Mittelalters: Doctor, doctoratus\">{{cite journal | last=Verger | first=J. | title=Doctor, doctoratus | journal=[[Lexikon des Mittelalters]] | volume=3 | pages=1155\u20131156 | year=1999}}</ref> Its roots can be traced to the [[early church]] when the term \"doctor\" referred to the [[Apostles]], [[church fathers]] and other [[Christianity|Christian]] authorities who taught and interpreted the [[Bible]].<ref name=\"Lexikon des Mittelalters: Doctor, doctoratus\"/> The right to grant a ''licentia docendi'' was originally reserved to the [[Catholic church|church]] which required the applicant to pass a test, take an [[Oath of allegiance]] and pay a fee. The [[Third Council of the Lateran]] of 1179 guaranteed the access \u2013 now largely free of charge \u2013 of all able applicants, who were, however, still tested for aptitude by the ecclesiastic scholastic.<ref name=\"Lexikon des Mittelalters: Licentia\">{{cite journal | last=Verger | first=J. | title=Licentia | journal=[[Lexikon des Mittelalters]] | volume=5 | pages=1957\u20131958 | year=1999}}</ref> This right remained a bone of contention between the church authorities and the slowly emancipating universities, but was granted by the [[pope]] to the [[University of Paris]] in 1213 where it became a universal license to teach (''licentia ubiquie docendi'').<ref name=\"Lexikon des Mittelalters: Licentia\"/> However, while the licentia continued to hold a higher prestige than the bachelor's degree (''Baccalaureus''), it was ultimately reduced to an intermediate step to the Magister and doctorate, both of which now became the exclusive qualification for teaching.<ref name=\"Lexikon des Mittelalters: Licentia\"/>\n\nThe earliest doctoral degrees (theology, law, and medicine) reflected the historical separation of all university study into these three fields. Over time the D.D. has gradually become less common and studies outside theology, law, and medicine have become more common (such studies were then called \"philosophy\", but are now classified as sciences and humanities \u2013 however this usage survives in the degree of Doctor of Philosophy).\n\nThe Ph.D. was originally a [[academic degree|degree]] granted by a [[university]] to learned individuals who had achieved the approval of their peers and who had demonstrated a long and productive career in the field of philosophy (in the broad sense of the term, meaning the pursuit of knowledge). The appellation of \"Doctor\" (from Latin: teacher) was usually awarded only when the individual was in middle age. It indicated a life dedicated to learning, knowledge, and the spread of knowledge. The Ph.D. entered widespread use in the 19th century at [[Humboldt University of Berlin|Friedrich Wilhelm University]] in Berlin as a degree to be granted to someone who had undertaken original research in the sciences or humanities. Prior to the formal degree, the contemporary doctorate (PhD), arguably, arose in Leipzig as a successor to the Master's (MA) degree in 1652 (Dr. habil).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://erhard-weigel-gesellschaft.de.dedi2970.your-server.de/biographie-weigels/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2016-10-29 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161114124147/http://erhard-weigel-gesellschaft.de.dedi2970.your-server.de/biographie-weigels/ |archivedate=14 November 2016 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\nIn some European countries, such as Italy and Portugal, Doctor became a title given to all or most degree holders, not just those with doctorates.<ref>{{cite book|title=Using Portuguese: A Guide to Contemporary Usage|author1= Ana Sofia Ganho|author2=Timothy McGovern|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=eGCq9t6DQf8C&pg=PA24|page=24|publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]]|date=18 March 2004|isbn= 9781139449380}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.quadrodeititoli.it/Index.aspx?IDL=2|title=Italian Qualification Framework for the Higher Education|accessdate=14 December 2016|publisher=Ministero dell\u2019Istruzione, dell\u2019Universit\u00e0 e della Ricerca}}</ref> \nAs a result, the title is now used by many professionals in these countries, including those such as lawyers who are not normally granted the title elsewhere.<ref>Portugal: [http://www.martindale.com/Alves-Pereira-Teixeira-de-Sousa/1996365-law-firm-2982267-people.htm Alves Periera Teixeira de Sousa].

As such, lawyers practicing common law in England were not doctoral candidates and had not earned a doctorate. When university degrees became more common for those wanting to qualify as a lawyer in England, the degree awarded was the [[Bachelor of Laws]] (LL.B.). Similarly in the US, even though degrees became standard for lawyers much earlier, the degree was again the LL.B., only becoming the [[Juris Doctor]] generally in the latter half of the 20th century.\n\nIn many English-speaking countries, it is common to refer to physicians by the title of doctor, even when they do not hold a doctoral level qualification. The word ''Doctor'' has long had a secondary meaning in English of [[physician]], e.g. in [[Johnson's Dictionary]], which quotes its use with this meaning by [[Shakespeare]].<ref name=Johnson1/> In the US, the medical societies established the proprietary medical colleges in the 19th century to award their own MDs,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://medlineplus.gov/ency/article/001936.htm|title=Doctor of medicine profession|work=US National Library of Medicine|accessdate=26 November 2016}}</ref> but in the UK and the British Empire, where degree granting was strictly controlled, this was not an option.

The council of the surgeons' College felt it to be impractical to secure the legal right to the title as this would mean gaining the right to award M.D.s, but noted that the title had been used by the public to refer to medics for generations and was used without any legal right by Bachelors of Medicine \u2013 the only obstacle to licentiates of both colleges doing the same was the prohibition in the physicians' bylaws.

It can be seen as a title in academic circles and in the mass media. In contrast to other academic titles (Professor, Associate Professor and Assistant Professor), the use of Doctor as a title has not been recognized by the [[Royal Institute of Thailand]].

In many European languages the term ''doctor'' is distinct from a medical practitioner, which can be referred to as e.g. ''l\u00e4kare'' in Swedish, ''Arzt'' in German, ''dokter'' or ''arts'' in Dutch, or ''l\u00e4\u00e4k\u00e4ri'' in Finnish.\n\nStandardisation of degrees into the three cycles of bachelor's\u2013master's\u2013doctorate across the [[European Higher Education Area]] (EHEA) is being carried out through the [[Bologna process]], although not all EHEA member states have fully conformed to the 1999 [[Bologna declaration]] in favour of their own historic customs. With respect to the title \"doctor\", the Bologna process makes no prescriptions regarding the names of degrees nor the titles they may confer. However, under the [[Lisbon Recognition Convention]], recognition of a foreign degree allows \"the use of an academic title, subject to the laws and regulations of the country in which recognition is sought\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.enic-naric.net/the-lisbon-recognition-convention.aspx|title=The Lisbon Recognition Convention|website=Enic-Naric|accessdate=26 February 2017}}</ref> According to the ''Explanatory report'', this means that: \"The competent authorities of the Parties may grant the right to use the title in the exact form in which it was awarded in the Party concerned or in any other form.

Customary doctorates do not exist even in the field of medicine: physicians hold the degree of ''l\u00e4\u00e4ketieteen lisensiaatti'' ([[Licentiate (degree)|Licentiate]] of Medicine), and are referred to simply as ''l\u00e4\u00e4k\u00e4ri'' (physician); \"tohtori\" would be rustic or old-fashioned. A research doctorate in medicine, ''l\u00e4\u00e4ketieteen tohtori'', requires further research work and a separate doctoral thesis, and is not taken by all medical graduates. Regardless, in Finnish usage, the use of titles is uncommon and restricted to only the most formal of contexts.\n\n====France====\n\nIn [[France]], the title of ''Docteur'' is only used generally for [[physician]]s (''m\u00e9decin'') but can also be used by holders of research doctorates. Medical professionals do not normally hold a [[doctorate]], which in France always refers to a research doctorate, but a \"State Diploma of Doctor of Medicine\" (''Dipl\u00f4me d'\u00c9tat de docteur en m\u00e9decine'').<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.vocabulaire-medical.fr/encyclopedie/035-docteur-medecin|title=Un m\u00e9decin est toujours \" docteur \" ; un \" docteur \" n'est pas n\u00e9cessairement un m\u00e9decin|language=French|work=Vocabulaire m\u00e9dical|accessdate=18 December 2016}}</ref>\n\nThe law in France allows the title of Dr to be used professionally by holders of research doctorates, with the field of their speciality being mentioned after the name.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/eli/loi/2013/7/22/2013-660/jo/article_78|title=LOI n\u00b0 2013-660 du 22 juillet 2013 relative \u00e0 l'enseignement sup\u00e9rieur et \u00e0 la recherche|at=TITRE VI : LES PERSONNELS DE L'ENSEIGNEMENT SUP\u00c9RIEUR ET DE LA RECHERCHE Article 78|website=Legifrance|publisher=[[Government of France]]|language=French}}</ref> The courts have ruled that stating the specialisation is not necessary except in circumstances specifically related to professional practice; at other times the title alone may be used.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.opimed.org/spip.php?article108|title=Du bon usage du titre de docteur|date=27 June 2008|accessdate=18 December 2016|work=OpiMed|publisher=MediaMed|language=French}}</ref> The courts have also determined that questioning the right of the holder of a research doctorate to use the title Dr is a form of libel.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://m.hervecausse.info/Le-titre-de-docteur-n-appartient-pas-aux-medecins--N-est-pas-docteur-qui-veut-et-qui-l-est-a-son-honneur--Mise-au_a249.html|title=Le titre de \"docteur\" n'appartient pas aux m\u00e9decins!

It is distinct from ''Arzt'', since a doctoral degree is not a requirement for medical practitioners, though colloquial use of the word ''Doktor'' for physician is common and ordinary people often incorrectly assume that only Doktors may practice medicine. For this reason, 80% of all students in medicine write \"doctoral\" dissertations, often comparable to a master's thesis in science,<ref name=\"Beisiegel791\">U.

(medicine), ''Dr. med. dent.'' (dentistry), ''Dr. med. vet.'' (veterinary medicine), ''Dr. rer. nat.'' (natural sciences), ''Dr. phil.'' (humanities), ''Dr. iur.'' (law), ''Dr. rer. pol.'' (economic and political sciences, also as Dr. rer. oec. in Switzerland), ''[[Doktoringenieur|Dr.-Ing.]]'' (engineering), and ''Dr. theol.'' (theology). All holders of doctoral degrees are appropriately addressed as \"Herr/Frau Dr. _____\" in all social situations.\n\nIn Germany, double doctorates are indicated in the title by ''\"Dr. Dr.\"'' or ''\"DDr.\"'' and triple doctorates as ''\"Dr. Dr. Dr.\"'' or ''\"DDDr.\"''. More doctorates are indicated by the addition of ''\"mult.\"'', such as ''\"Dr. mult.\"''. Honorary titles are shown with the addition of ''\"h.c.\"'', which stands for ''\"honoris causa\"''. Example: ''\"Dr. h.c. mult.\"''. Some honorary titles are shown by addition of German equivalents of ''\"h.c.\"'', like ''\"e.h.''\", ''\"E.h.\"'', or ''\"eh.\"'', which stand for ''\"ehrenhalber\"'' (honorary). Example: ''\"Dr. e.h. mult.\"''.\n\nAll people holding a doctorate from an EU member state are, since 2001, entitled to use \"Doctor\" or \"Dr.\" in all formal, legal and published communications without any further addenda. For academics with doctorates from non-EU member states, the qualification must be recognised formally (\"validated\") by the Federal Educational Ministry in Bonn. The recognition process can be done by the employer or employee and may be part of the official bureaucracy for confirming professional status and is dependent on individual bilateral agreements between Germany and other countries and, since 2007, the Lisbon Recognition Convention.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.anerkennung-in-deutschland.de/html/en/lisbon_convention.php |title=Lisbon Convention|website=Recognition in Germany|publisher=Federal Ministry of Education and Research|accessdate=26 February 2017}}</ref> An example of mutual recognition of Doctor titles among EU countries is the \"Bonn Agreement of November 14, 1994\", signed between Germany and Spain (prior to the general recognition of EU doctorates).<ref>[http://www.boe.es/g/es/bases_datos/doc.php?coleccion=iberlex&id=1995/12243&codmap= Bolet\u00edn Oficial del Estado.

It was announced in 2012 that this would be further extended to cover PhDs awarded in New Zealand. PhDs that were awarded in the United States are recognized if the awarding institution is classified by the [[Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching]] as a \"Research University (high research activity)\" or as a \"Research University (very high research activity).\" Permission to use the title covers only scientific research degrees and does not extend to professional degrees such as the M.D. or J.D.<ref>{{cite web| title = F\u00fchrung ausl\u00e4ndischer Hochschulgrade| archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20150211223335/http://www.kmk.org/wissenschaft-hochschule/internationale-hochschulangelegenheiten/fuehrung-auslaendischer-hochschulgrade.html| archive-date = 11 February 2015| url = http://www.kmk.org/wissenschaft-hochschule/internationale-hochschulangelegenheiten/fuehrung-auslaendischer-hochschulgrade.html| url-status = dead| df = dmy-all}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.kmk.org/fileadmin/veroeffentlichungen_beschluesse/2001/2001_09_21-Auslaendische-HS-Grade.pdf|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150211223335/http://www.kmk.org/fileadmin/veroeffentlichungen_beschluesse/2001/2001_09_21-Auslaendische-HS-Grade.pdf|url-status=dead|archive-date=11 February 2015|title=Vereinbarung der L\u00e4nder in der Bundesrepublik Deutschland \u00fcber beg\u00fcnstigende Regelungen gem\u00e4\u00df Ziffer 4 der \"Grunds\u00e4tze f\u00fcr die Regelung der F\u00fchrung ausl\u00e4ndischer Hochschulgrade im Sinne einer gesetzlichen Allgemeingenehmigung durch einheitliche gesetzliche Bestimmungen vom 14.04.2000\" (Beschluss der Kultusministerkonferenz vom 21.09.2001 i. d.

The term \"\u0399\u03b1\u03c4\u03c1\u03cc\u03c2\" (''iatros'') indicates medical practitioners.\n\n====Hungary====\n\nIn Hungary, graduates of six-year medical schools (''dr. med.''), five-year dentistry schools (''dr. med. dent.''), five-year law schools (''dr. jur.'') and five-year veterinary medical schools (''dr. vet.'') receive the title of a ''doctor'' at the end of their studies, after completing and successfully defending their thesis; their undergraduate studies must have lasted for a minimum of three years. Completing a PhD research programme (or DLA in arts and music) also leads to the doctor title. Since 2008, also those who graduated of five-year [[pharmacy]] schools have the right to use the title \"dr\" (''dr. pharm.'').\n\nA large part of Hungarians with doctor titles received their titles for research in the old academic system before PhD was introduced in Hungary. Since the introduction of PhD title (1993), the ''dr. univ'' title (given before 1993). The CSc ''Candidate of Science'' title was a scientific title in the old academic system and is now treated as an equivalent of PhD. CSc titles were awarded by the [[Hungarian Academy of Sciences]].\n\nThe highest level doctoral degree in Hungary is DSc ''Doctor of Sciences'', awarded by the Hungarian Academy of Sciences. It is also called ''Doctor of the Hungarian Academy of Sciences''.\n\nThe title of doctor used to become a part of the name and was added as such to personal identity documents. This practice is still common and graduates after receiving their diploma would usually change their personal documents in order to officially indicate the achievement.\n\n====Ireland====\nUsage in Ireland is similar to that in the UK.

(1915). [http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05072b.htm Catholic Encyclopedia]. New York: Encyclopedia Press. Accessed 26 May 2008.</ref> and all other Italian universities followed that model. During the 20th century Italian universities introduced more advanced research degrees, such as the Ph.D., and now that it is part of the E.U. [[Bologna Process]], a new three-year first degree, or \"laurea\" (equivalent to a B.A. of other countries, [[European Qualifications Framework|EQF]] & [[ISCED]] 2011 Level 6), has been introduced. The old-style \"laurea\" is now known as \"laurea magistrale/specialistica\" (Bologna Process second cycle/[[European Qualifications Framework|EQF]] & [[ISCED]] 2011 Level 7). For historical reasons, even to this day, the title of \"dottore/dottoressa\" (abbrev. both as dott/dott.ssa or as dr./dr.ssa ) is awarded even to those who have studied for a \"laurea\"([[European Qualifications Framework|EQF]] & [[ISCED]] 2011 Level 6). Upper levels of degree are anyway shown in the title, as those who obtain a master's degree can be referred to as \"dottore/dottoressa magistrale\" (''masterly doctor'', [[European Qualifications Framework|EQF]] & [[ISCED]] 2011 Level 7) while those who achieve the relatively new program of \"dottorato di ricerca\" (research doctorate, equivalent of a ''Ph.D.'' in [[English Language|English]]-speaking or ''Doktor'' (''Dr.'') in [[German Language|German]]-speaking Countries, [[European Qualifications Framework|EQF]] & [[ISCED]] 2011 Level 8), carry the title of \"dottore/dottoressa di ricerca\" (research doctor), which can be abbreviated as \"Dott. Ric.\" or \"Ph.D.\"<ref>L. n. 240 \u2013 30 December 2010, G.U. n. 10\u201314 January 2011, Art. 8-bis.</ref>\n\n====Malta====\nIn [[Malta]], the title of Doctor is used by academic doctors (with Ph.D.s), medical practitioners, dentists and lawyers. Its use by lawyers is due to the qualifying degree for practicing law having been the [[Legum Doctor|LLD]] until reforms in 2014, and has been described as \"historical baggage\" by the Dean of the [[University of Malta]]'s law school. Lawyers do not generally use the title when practicing outside of Malta.<ref>{{cite news|work=Times of Malta|date=11 January 2014|author= Ivan Martin|title=I am not a doctor, so why call myself one?|url=http://www.timesofmalta.com/articles/view/20140111/local/-I-am-not-a-doctor-so-why-call-myself-one-.502162}}</ref>\n\n====The Netherlands====\nIn the [[Dutch language]] the word \"dokter\" refers to a physician, whereas \"doctor\" refers to the academic title. The doctor title is abbreviated as dr. placed before the holders name (note the lowercase).\n\nTo enter a Dutch doctoral defense, the candidate must hold a validated master's degree (a master's degree of an acknowledged university, or a master equivalent degree validated on a case by case basis by the Dutch government). In some cases the candidate can be granted special dispensation if no master's degree is held.\nThere is no specific notation of the discipline in which the doctorate is obtained. Once the doctorate is obtained the preceding master's degree is generally no longer reported. Exceptions only exist for the disciplines with specific master titles of engineering \"ir.\" (\"ingenieur\", i.e. Engineer) and law \"mr.\" (\"meester\", i.e. Master of Law) where the title dr. is added to the original master title. For these disciplines, the original master's degree abbreviation is combined with the dr. abbreviation thus resulting in for example \"dr. ir. Familyman\". The dr. title is always placed in front of the ir. title. In the case of a PhD in law, the original mr. title is placed before the dr. title (mr. dr., see e.g. [[Jan Peter Balkenende]]). For a person having a law master's degree, but holding a PhD in another field than law the mr. title is placed after the dr. title (dr. mr.). No specific notation or title for the medical disciplines exists in the Netherlands. Although a physician is usually referred to as \"dokter\" (note the spelling difference) this does not necessarily imply the physician holds a doctoral degree; nor does it give the physician a title equivalent to that of PhD.\n\nConfusion can be caused by the original Dutch Master level title \"drs.\" (for all non-engineering and non-law master's degrees). This abbreviation stands for the Dutch title [[doctorandus]] Latin for \"he who should become a doctor\" (female form is \"doctoranda\"). Dutch drs. should not be confused with the plural 'doctorates': having a PhD in multiple disciplines. Once a doctorate is achieved the doctorandus is promoted to doctor, and no longer uses the drs. abbreviation.<br>\nStacking of multiples titles of the same level, as seen in countries like for example Germany (Dr. Dr. Dr. Musterfrau) is highly uncommon in the Netherlands (although stacking of titles with different levels is common: prof. dr. ir. Appelmans). Those who have multiple doctor titles may use dr.mult. before their name, although this is rarely used.\n\nAfter obtaining a doctorate successfully, Dutch doctors may bear either the title dr. (lower case) before, or the letter D (rarely in practice) behind their name, but not both simultaneously. In the Netherlands, Academic titles are used exclusively within academia. Holding a PhD title has become a standard requirement for a university career. The doctor title has little to no meaning or implications for public life outside academia. It cannot be added to documentation (e.g. passport, drivers licence), and is used infrequently in daily practice.\n\nHistorically, The Netherlands used their own academic degree nomenclature, but for many years now have recognised and implemented the [[Bologna declaration]]. In everyday practice, the Anglo Saxon titles (e.g. PhD) are frequently used. Dutch academic titles are legally protected. PhD degrees can only be granted by recognised (research) universities. Illegal use is considered a misdemeanor and subject to legal prosecution.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://wetten.overheid.nl/BWBR0001854/DerdeBoek/TitelII/Artikel435/geldigheidsdatum_21-10-2009 |title=Art. 435 Sr |language=Dutch |publisher=Wetten.overheid.nl |date=21 October 2009 |accessdate=8 July 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://translate.google.nl/translate?prev=hp&js=y&u=http://wetten.overheid.nl/BWBR0001854/DerdeBoek/TitelII/Artikel435/geldigheidsdatum_21-10-2009&sl=nl&tl=en&history_state0=&swap=1 |title=Art. 435 Sr (translated by Google) |language=Dutch |publisher=Translate.google.nl|accessdate=8 July 2010}}</ref>\n\n====Portugal====\nIn [[Portugal]], up to recent times after the completion of an undergraduate degree \u2013 except in [[architecture]] and [[engineering]] \u2013 a person was referred to as ''doutor (Dr.) \u2013 male'' or ''doutora (Dra.) \u2013 female''. The architects and engineers were referred by their professional titles: ''arquitecto'' (Arq.) and ''engenheiro'' (Eng.). [[Nurse]]s are also referred to as \"nurse\", ''enfermeiro'' (male) or ''enfermeira'' (female), the title being ''Enf.'' for both.\n\nNowadays Portugal is a signatory to the [[Bologna process]] and according to the current legislation the title of Doctor (''doutor, doutora'') is reserved for graduate holders of an academic [[doctorate]].<ref>Decreto-Lei n.\u00ba 107/2008, de 25 de Junho</ref> Professions such as [[physician]]s, [[Attorney at law|attorneys]], [[pharmacist]]s, [[veterinarian]]s, and few others are usually referred to by the title Dr. (doutor) even if they have not been awarded a doctoral degree.\n\nHowever, custom gives the legislation little strength and most graduates use the Dr. title in its abbreviated form, although use of the full ''Doutor'' is normally restricted to those with doctorates.. Those who are both holders of an academic doctorate and Professors at a college level are generally referred to as Professor Doutor.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.university.pt/phd-in-portugal/|title=PhD in Portugal|website=University.pt|accessdate=17 December 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161220173333/http://www.university.pt/phd-in-portugal/|archive-date=20 December 2016|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\n====Spain====\nThe social standing of Doctors in Spain is evidenced by the fact that only [[Ph.D.]] holders, [[Grandees]] and [[Duke]]s can take seat and cover their heads in the presence of the King.<ref>{{in lang|es}} [http://www.protocolo.org/gest_web/proto_Seccion.pl?rfID=459&arefid=2871&pag=8 Ra\u00edces de las normas y tradiciones del protocolo y ceremonial universitario actual: las universidades del Antiguo R\u00e9gimen y los actos de colaci\u00f3n.

It may also be awarded for outstanding achievement in a particular field.  This service or achievement does not need to be academic in nature. Often, the same set of degrees is used for higher doctorates, but they are distinguished as being ''honoris causa'': in comprehensive lists, the lettering used to indicate the possession of a higher doctorate is often adjusted to indicate this, for example, \"Hon. Sc.D.\", as opposed to the earned research doctorate \"[[Sc.D.]]\". The degrees of Doctor of the University (D.Univ.) and [[Doctor of Humane Letters]] (D.H.L.), however, are only awarded as honorary degrees.\n\nBy convention, recipients of honorary doctorates do not use the title \"Dr\" in general correspondence, although in formal correspondence from the university issuing the honorary degree it is normal to address the recipient by the title.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://honorarydegrees.wvu.edu/history|title=The Honorary Degree|publisher=[[West Virginia University]]|quote=[H]onorary degree recipients should not refer to themselves as \"Doctor\", nor should they use the title on business cards or in correspondence.

It has been used as an academic title in Europe since the 13th century, when the first doctorates were awarded at the [[University of Bologna]] and the [[University of Paris]]. Having become established in European [[universities]], this usage spread around the world. Contracted \"Dr\" or \"Dr.\", it is used as a designation for a person who has obtained a [[doctorate]] (e.g. [[Doctor of Philosophy|PhD]]). In many parts of the world it is also used by medical practitioners, regardless of whether or not they hold a doctoral-level degree.\n\n==Origins==\nThe doctorate ({{lang-la|doce\u014d|lit=I teach}}) appeared in [[Middle Ages|medieval Europe]] as a license to teach ({{lang-la|licentia docendi|links=no}}) at a [[medieval university]].<ref name=\"Lexikon des Mittelalters: Doctor, doctoratus\">{{cite journal | last=Verger | first=J. | title=Doctor, doctoratus | journal=[[Lexikon des Mittelalters]] | volume=3 | pages=1155\u20131156 | year=1999}}</ref> Its roots can be traced to the [[early church]] when the term \"doctor\" referred to the [[Apostles]], [[church fathers]] and other [[Christianity|Christian]] authorities who taught and interpreted the [[Bible]].<ref name=\"Lexikon des Mittelalters: Doctor, doctoratus\"/> The right to grant a ''licentia docendi'' was originally reserved to the [[Catholic church|church]] which required the applicant to pass a test, take an [[Oath of allegiance]] and pay a fee. The [[Third Council of the Lateran]] of 1179 guaranteed the access \u2013 now largely free of charge \u2013 of all able applicants, who were, however, still tested for aptitude by the ecclesiastic scholastic.<ref name=\"Lexikon des Mittelalters: Licentia\">{{cite journal | last=Verger | first=J. | title=Licentia | journal=[[Lexikon des Mittelalters]] | volume=5 | pages=1957\u20131958 | year=1999}}</ref> This right remained a bone of contention between the church authorities and the slowly emancipating universities, but was granted by the [[pope]] to the [[University of Paris]] in 1213 where it became a universal license to teach (''licentia ubiquie docendi'').<ref name=\"Lexikon des Mittelalters: Licentia\"/> However, while the licentia continued to hold a higher prestige than the bachelor's degree (''Baccalaureus''), it was ultimately reduced to an intermediate step to the Magister and doctorate, both of which now became the exclusive qualification for teaching.<ref name=\"Lexikon des Mittelalters: Licentia\"/>\n\nThe earliest doctoral degrees (theology, law, and medicine) reflected the historical separation of all university study into these three fields. Over time the D.D. has gradually become less common and studies outside theology, law, and medicine have become more common (such studies were then called \"philosophy\", but are now classified as sciences and humanities \u2013 however this usage survives in the degree of Doctor of Philosophy).\n\nThe Ph.D. was originally a [[academic degree|degree]] granted by a [[university]] to learned individuals who had achieved the approval of their peers and who had demonstrated a long and productive career in the field of philosophy (in the broad sense of the term, meaning the pursuit of knowledge). The appellation of \"Doctor\" (from Latin: teacher) was usually awarded only when the individual was in middle age. It indicated a life dedicated to learning, knowledge, and the spread of knowledge. The Ph.D. entered widespread use in the 19th century at [[Humboldt University of Berlin|Friedrich Wilhelm University]] in Berlin as a degree to be granted to someone who had undertaken original research in the sciences or humanities. Prior to the formal degree, the contemporary doctorate (PhD), arguably, arose in Leipzig as a successor to the Master's (MA) degree in 1652 (Dr. habil).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://erhard-weigel-gesellschaft.de.dedi2970.your-server.de/biographie-weigels/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2016-10-29 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161114124147/http://erhard-weigel-gesellschaft.de.dedi2970.your-server.de/biographie-weigels/ |archivedate=14 November 2016 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\nIn some European countries, such as Italy and Portugal, Doctor became a title given to all or most degree holders, not just those with doctorates.<ref>{{cite book|title=Using Portuguese: A Guide to Contemporary Usage|author1= Ana Sofia Ganho|author2=Timothy McGovern|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=eGCq9t6DQf8C&pg=PA24|page=24|publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]]|date=18 March 2004|isbn= 9781139449380}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.quadrodeititoli.it/Index.aspx?IDL=2|title=Italian Qualification Framework for the Higher Education|accessdate=14 December 2016|publisher=Ministero dell\u2019Istruzione, dell\u2019Universit\u00e0 e della Ricerca}}</ref> \nAs a result, the title is now used by many professionals in these countries, including those such as lawyers who are not normally granted the title elsewhere.<ref>Portugal: [http://www.martindale.com/Alves-Pereira-Teixeira-de-Sousa/1996365-law-firm-2982267-people.htm Alves Periera Teixeira de Sousa].

As such, lawyers practicing common law in England were not doctoral candidates and had not earned a doctorate. When university degrees became more common for those wanting to qualify as a lawyer in England, the degree awarded was the [[Bachelor of Laws]] (LL.B.).

It can be seen as a title in academic circles and in the mass media. In contrast to other academic titles (Professor, Associate Professor and Assistant Professor), the use of Doctor as a title has not been recognized by the [[Royal Institute of Thailand]]. Therefore, this title, in theory, cannot be used officially.

In many European languages the term ''doctor'' is distinct from a medical practitioner, which can be referred to as e.g. ''l\u00e4kare'' in Swedish, ''Arzt'' in German, ''dokter'' or ''arts'' in Dutch, or ''l\u00e4\u00e4k\u00e4ri'' in Finnish.\n\nStandardisation of degrees into the three cycles of bachelor's\u2013master's\u2013doctorate across the [[European Higher Education Area]] (EHEA) is being carried out through the [[Bologna process]], although not all EHEA member states have fully conformed to the 1999 [[Bologna declaration]] in favour of their own historic customs. With respect to the title \"doctor\", the Bologna process makes no prescriptions regarding the names of degrees nor the titles they may confer. However, under the [[Lisbon Recognition Convention]], recognition of a foreign degree allows \"the use of an academic title, subject to the laws and regulations of the country in which recognition is sought\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.enic-naric.net/the-lisbon-recognition-convention.aspx|title=The Lisbon Recognition Convention|website=Enic-Naric|accessdate=26 February 2017}}</ref> According to the ''Explanatory report'', this means that: \"The competent authorities of the Parties may grant the right to use the title in the exact form in which it was awarded in the Party concerned or in any other form.

Getting the doctorate requires advanced studies after the master's degree, writing a [[thesis]], nowadays often a [[thesis by publication]], and publicly defending the thesis. Customary doctorates do not exist even in the field of medicine: physicians hold the degree of ''l\u00e4\u00e4ketieteen lisensiaatti'' ([[Licentiate (degree)|Licentiate]] of Medicine), and are referred to simply as ''l\u00e4\u00e4k\u00e4ri'' (physician); \"tohtori\" would be rustic or old-fashioned. A research doctorate in medicine, ''l\u00e4\u00e4ketieteen tohtori'', requires further research work and a separate doctoral thesis, and is not taken by all medical graduates. Regardless, in Finnish usage, the use of titles is uncommon and restricted to only the most formal of contexts.\n\n====France====\n\nIn [[France]], the title of ''Docteur'' is only used generally for [[physician]]s (''m\u00e9decin'') but can also be used by holders of research doctorates. Medical professionals do not normally hold a [[doctorate]], which in France always refers to a research doctorate, but a \"State Diploma of Doctor of Medicine\" (''Dipl\u00f4me d'\u00c9tat de docteur en m\u00e9decine'').<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.vocabulaire-medical.fr/encyclopedie/035-docteur-medecin|title=Un m\u00e9decin est toujours \" docteur \" ; un \" docteur \" n'est pas n\u00e9cessairement un m\u00e9decin|language=French|work=Vocabulaire m\u00e9dical|accessdate=18 December 2016}}</ref>\n\nThe law in France allows the title of Dr to be used professionally by holders of research doctorates, with the field of their speciality being mentioned after the name.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/eli/loi/2013/7/22/2013-660/jo/article_78|title=LOI n\u00b0 2013-660 du 22 juillet 2013 relative \u00e0 l'enseignement sup\u00e9rieur et \u00e0 la recherche|at=TITRE VI : LES PERSONNELS DE L'ENSEIGNEMENT SUP\u00c9RIEUR ET DE LA RECHERCHE Article 78|website=Legifrance|publisher=[[Government of France]]|language=French}}</ref> The courts have ruled that stating the specialisation is not necessary except in circumstances specifically related to professional practice; at other times the title alone may be used.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.opimed.org/spip.php?article108|title=Du bon usage du titre de docteur|date=27 June 2008|accessdate=18 December 2016|work=OpiMed|publisher=MediaMed|language=French}}</ref> The courts have also determined that questioning the right of the holder of a research doctorate to use the title Dr is a form of libel.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://m.hervecausse.info/Le-titre-de-docteur-n-appartient-pas-aux-medecins--N-est-pas-docteur-qui-veut-et-qui-l-est-a-son-honneur--Mise-au_a249.html|title=Le titre de \"docteur\" n'appartient pas aux m\u00e9decins!

(medicine), ''Dr. med. dent.'' (dentistry), ''Dr. med. vet.'' (veterinary medicine), ''Dr. rer. nat.'' (natural sciences), ''Dr. phil.'' (humanities), ''Dr. iur.'' (law), ''Dr. rer. pol.'' (economic and political sciences, also as Dr. rer. oec. in Switzerland), ''[[Doktoringenieur|Dr.-Ing.]]'' (engineering), and ''Dr. theol.'' (theology). All holders of doctoral degrees are appropriately addressed as \"Herr/Frau Dr. _____\" in all social situations.\n\nIn Germany, double doctorates are indicated in the title by ''\"Dr. Dr.\"'' or ''\"DDr.\"'' and triple doctorates as ''\"Dr. Dr. Dr.\"'' or ''\"DDDr.\"''. More doctorates are indicated by the addition of ''\"mult.\"'', such as ''\"Dr. mult.\"''. Honorary titles are shown with the addition of ''\"h.c.\"'', which stands for ''\"honoris causa\"''. Example: ''\"Dr. h.c. mult.\"''. Some honorary titles are shown by addition of German equivalents of ''\"h.c.\"'', like ''\"e.h.''\", ''\"E.h.\"'', or ''\"eh.\"'', which stand for ''\"ehrenhalber\"'' (honorary). Example: ''\"Dr. e.h. mult.\"''.\n\nAll people holding a doctorate from an EU member state are, since 2001, entitled to use \"Doctor\" or \"Dr.\" in all formal, legal and published communications without any further addenda.

The term \"\u0399\u03b1\u03c4\u03c1\u03cc\u03c2\" (''iatros'') indicates medical practitioners.\n\n====Hungary====\n\nIn Hungary, graduates of six-year medical schools (''dr. med.''), five-year dentistry schools (''dr. med. dent.''), five-year law schools (''dr. jur.'') and five-year veterinary medical schools (''dr. vet.'') receive the title of a ''doctor'' at the end of their studies, after completing and successfully defending their thesis; their undergraduate studies must have lasted for a minimum of three years. Completing a PhD research programme (or DLA in arts and music) also leads to the doctor title. Since 2008, also those who graduated of five-year [[pharmacy]] schools have the right to use the title \"dr\" (''dr. pharm.'').\n\nA large part of Hungarians with doctor titles received their titles for research in the old academic system before PhD was introduced in Hungary. Since the introduction of PhD title (1993), the ''dr. univ'' title (given before 1993). The CSc ''Candidate of Science'' title was a scientific title in the old academic system and is now treated as an equivalent of PhD. CSc titles were awarded by the [[Hungarian Academy of Sciences]].\n\nThe highest level doctoral degree in Hungary is DSc ''Doctor of Sciences'', awarded by the Hungarian Academy of Sciences. It is also called ''Doctor of the Hungarian Academy of Sciences''.\n\nThe title of doctor used to become a part of the name and was added as such to personal identity documents. This practice is still common and graduates after receiving their diploma would usually change their personal documents in order to officially indicate the achievement.\n\n====Ireland====\nUsage in Ireland is similar to that in the UK.

(1915). [http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05072b.htm Catholic Encyclopedia]. New York: Encyclopedia Press. Accessed 26 May 2008.</ref> and all other Italian universities followed that model. During the 20th century Italian universities introduced more advanced research degrees, such as the Ph.D., and now that it is part of the E.U. [[Bologna Process]], a new three-year first degree, or \"laurea\" (equivalent to a B.A. of other countries, [[European Qualifications Framework|EQF]] & [[ISCED]] 2011 Level 6), has been introduced. The old-style \"laurea\" is now known as \"laurea magistrale/specialistica\" (Bologna Process second cycle/[[European Qualifications Framework|EQF]] & [[ISCED]] 2011 Level 7). For historical reasons, even to this day, the title of \"dottore/dottoressa\" (abbrev. both as dott/dott.ssa or as dr./dr.ssa ) is awarded even to those who have studied for a \"laurea\"([[European Qualifications Framework|EQF]] & [[ISCED]] 2011 Level 6). Upper levels of degree are anyway shown in the title, as those who obtain a master's degree can be referred to as \"dottore/dottoressa magistrale\" (''masterly doctor'', [[European Qualifications Framework|EQF]] & [[ISCED]] 2011 Level 7) while those who achieve the relatively new program of \"dottorato di ricerca\" (research doctorate, equivalent of a ''Ph.D.'' in [[English Language|English]]-speaking or ''Doktor'' (''Dr.'') in [[German Language|German]]-speaking Countries, [[European Qualifications Framework|EQF]] & [[ISCED]] 2011 Level 8), carry the title of \"dottore/dottoressa di ricerca\" (research doctor), which can be abbreviated as \"Dott. Ric.\" or \"Ph.D.\"<ref>L. n. 240 \u2013 30 December 2010, G.U. n. 10\u201314 January 2011, Art. 8-bis.</ref>\n\n====Malta====\nIn [[Malta]], the title of Doctor is used by academic doctors (with Ph.D.s), medical practitioners, dentists and lawyers. Its use by lawyers is due to the qualifying degree for practicing law having been the [[Legum Doctor|LLD]] until reforms in 2014, and has been described as \"historical baggage\" by the Dean of the [[University of Malta]]'s law school. Lawyers do not generally use the title when practicing outside of Malta.<ref>{{cite news|work=Times of Malta|date=11 January 2014|author= Ivan Martin|title=I am not a doctor, so why call myself one?|url=http://www.timesofmalta.com/articles/view/20140111/local/-I-am-not-a-doctor-so-why-call-myself-one-.502162}}</ref>\n\n====The Netherlands====\nIn the [[Dutch language]] the word \"dokter\" refers to a physician, whereas \"doctor\" refers to the academic title. The doctor title is abbreviated as dr. placed before the holders name (note the lowercase).\n\nTo enter a Dutch doctoral defense, the candidate must hold a validated master's degree (a master's degree of an acknowledged university, or a master equivalent degree validated on a case by case basis by the Dutch government). In some cases the candidate can be granted special dispensation if no master's degree is held.\nThere is no specific notation of the discipline in which the doctorate is obtained. Once the doctorate is obtained the preceding master's degree is generally no longer reported. Exceptions only exist for the disciplines with specific master titles of engineering \"ir.\" (\"ingenieur\", i.e. Engineer) and law \"mr.\" (\"meester\", i.e. Master of Law) where the title dr. is added to the original master title. For these disciplines, the original master's degree abbreviation is combined with the dr. abbreviation thus resulting in for example \"dr. ir. Familyman\". The dr. title is always placed in front of the ir. title. In the case of a PhD in law, the original mr. title is placed before the dr. title (mr. dr., see e.g. [[Jan Peter Balkenende]]). For a person having a law master's degree, but holding a PhD in another field than law the mr. title is placed after the dr. title (dr. mr.). No specific notation or title for the medical disciplines exists in the Netherlands. Although a physician is usually referred to as \"dokter\" (note the spelling difference) this does not necessarily imply the physician holds a doctoral degree; nor does it give the physician a title equivalent to that of PhD.\n\nConfusion can be caused by the original Dutch Master level title \"drs.\" (for all non-engineering and non-law master's degrees). This abbreviation stands for the Dutch title [[doctorandus]] Latin for \"he who should become a doctor\" (female form is \"doctoranda\"). Dutch drs. should not be confused with the plural 'doctorates': having a PhD in multiple disciplines. Once a doctorate is achieved the doctorandus is promoted to doctor, and no longer uses the drs. abbreviation.<br>\nStacking of multiples titles of the same level, as seen in countries like for example Germany (Dr. Dr. Dr. Musterfrau) is highly uncommon in the Netherlands (although stacking of titles with different levels is common: prof. dr. ir. Appelmans). Those who have multiple doctor titles may use dr.mult. before their name, although this is rarely used.\n\nAfter obtaining a doctorate successfully, Dutch doctors may bear either the title dr. (lower case) before, or the letter D (rarely in practice) behind their name, but not both simultaneously. In the Netherlands, Academic titles are used exclusively within academia. Holding a PhD title has become a standard requirement for a university career. The doctor title has little to no meaning or implications for public life outside academia. It cannot be added to documentation (e.g. passport, drivers licence), and is used infrequently in daily practice.\n\nHistorically, The Netherlands used their own academic degree nomenclature, but for many years now have recognised and implemented the [[Bologna declaration]]. In everyday practice, the Anglo Saxon titles (e.g. PhD) are frequently used. Dutch academic titles are legally protected. PhD degrees can only be granted by recognised (research) universities. Illegal use is considered a misdemeanor and subject to legal prosecution.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://wetten.overheid.nl/BWBR0001854/DerdeBoek/TitelII/Artikel435/geldigheidsdatum_21-10-2009 |title=Art. 435 Sr |language=Dutch |publisher=Wetten.overheid.nl |date=21 October 2009 |accessdate=8 July 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://translate.google.nl/translate?prev=hp&js=y&u=http://wetten.overheid.nl/BWBR0001854/DerdeBoek/TitelII/Artikel435/geldigheidsdatum_21-10-2009&sl=nl&tl=en&history_state0=&swap=1 |title=Art. 435 Sr (translated by Google) |language=Dutch |publisher=Translate.google.nl|accessdate=8 July 2010}}</ref>\n\n====Portugal====\nIn [[Portugal]], up to recent times after the completion of an undergraduate degree \u2013 except in [[architecture]] and [[engineering]] \u2013 a person was referred to as ''doutor (Dr.) \u2013 male'' or ''doutora (Dra.) \u2013 female''. The architects and engineers were referred by their professional titles: ''arquitecto'' (Arq.) and ''engenheiro'' (Eng.). [[Nurse]]s are also referred to as \"nurse\", ''enfermeiro'' (male) or ''enfermeira'' (female), the title being ''Enf.'' for both.\n\nNowadays Portugal is a signatory to the [[Bologna process]] and according to the current legislation the title of Doctor (''doutor, doutora'') is reserved for graduate holders of an academic [[doctorate]].<ref>Decreto-Lei n.\u00ba 107/2008, de 25 de Junho</ref> Professions such as [[physician]]s, [[Attorney at law|attorneys]], [[pharmacist]]s, [[veterinarian]]s, and few others are usually referred to by the title Dr. (doutor) even if they have not been awarded a doctoral degree.\n\nHowever, custom gives the legislation little strength and most graduates use the Dr. title in its abbreviated form, although use of the full ''Doutor'' is normally restricted to those with doctorates.. Those who are both holders of an academic doctorate and Professors at a college level are generally referred to as Professor Doutor.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.university.pt/phd-in-portugal/|title=PhD in Portugal|website=University.pt|accessdate=17 December 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161220173333/http://www.university.pt/phd-in-portugal/|archive-date=20 December 2016|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\n====Spain====\nThe social standing of Doctors in Spain is evidenced by the fact that only [[Ph.D.]] holders, [[Grandees]] and [[Duke]]s can take seat and cover their heads in the presence of the King.<ref>{{in lang|es}} [http://www.protocolo.org/gest_web/proto_Seccion.pl?rfID=459&arefid=2871&pag=8 Ra\u00edces de las normas y tradiciones del protocolo y ceremonial universitario actual: las universidades del Antiguo R\u00e9gimen y los actos de colaci\u00f3n.

It may also be awarded for outstanding achievement in a particular field.  This service or achievement does not need to be academic in nature. Often, the same set of degrees is used for higher doctorates, but they are distinguished as being ''honoris causa'': in comprehensive lists, the lettering used to indicate the possession of a higher doctorate is often adjusted to indicate this, for example, \"Hon. Sc.D.\", as opposed to the earned research doctorate \"[[Sc.D.]]\". The degrees of Doctor of the University (D.Univ.) and [[Doctor of Humane Letters]] (D.H.L.), however, are only awarded as honorary degrees.\n\nBy convention, recipients of honorary doctorates do not use the title \"Dr\" in general correspondence, although in formal correspondence from the university issuing the honorary degree it is normal to address the recipient by the title.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://honorarydegrees.wvu.edu/history|title=The Honorary Degree|publisher=[[West Virginia University]]|quote=[H]onorary degree recipients should not refer to themselves as \"Doctor\", nor should they use the title on business cards or in correspondence.
