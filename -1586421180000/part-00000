His father, also named Frederick, was employed at the [[Guinness Brewery]]. May pursued his musical studies at the [[Royal Irish Academy of Music]], where he was taught composition by [[John Larchet]]. In 1930, McCullough Pigott and Co. published his ''Irish Love Song''.

During [[World War I]] it was claimed in the British press that Germany had a [[German Corpse Factory|corpse factory]] in which they used the bodies of their own soldiers to make glycerine and soap. During, and after, [[World War II]], widely circulated rumors claimed that [[soap]] was being [[mass production|mass-produced]] from the bodies of the victims of [[Nazi concentration camps]] located in [[German-occupied Poland]]. During the [[Nuremberg trials]] items were presented as evidence of such production.<ref name=\"Nuremberg, Robert E 1984, pp. 298-9\">Justice at Nuremberg, Robert E.

This appears to have originated as rumor among British soldiers and Belgians. The first recorded reference is in 1915 when [[Cynthia Asquith]] noted in her diary (16 June 1915): \"We discussed the rumour that the Germans utilise even their corpses by converting them into glycerine with the by-product of soap.\"<ref name=nea>Neander, Joachim, ''The German Corpse Factory.

He subsequently insisted that his remarks had been misreported. The controversy led the British Foreign Secretary Sir [[Austen Chamberlain]] to officially state that the government accepted that the \"corpse factory\" story was untrue.<ref>{{cite book |last=Ponsonby |first=Arthur |authorlink=Arthur Ponsonby |title=Falsehood in Wartime |publisher=Dutton |year=1928 |location=New York |pages=102, 111\u2013112}}</ref> The belief that the British had deliberately invented the story was later used by the Nazis.<ref>Marlin, Randal (2002).

Germany suffered a shortage of fats during World War II, and the production of soap was put under government control. The \"human soap\" rumours may have originated from the bars of soap being marked with the initials RIF, which was interpreted by some as ''{{lang|de|Rein-Judisches-Fett}}'' (\"Pure Jewish Fat\"); in [[Blackletter#Fraktur|German Blackletter]] font the difference between I and J is only in length. RIF in fact stood for ''{{lang|de|Reichsstelle f\u00fcr industrielle Fettversorgung}}'' (\"National Center for Industrial Fat Provisioning\", the German government agency responsible for wartime production and distribution of soap and washing products). RIF soap was a poor quality substitute product that contained no fat at all, human or otherwise.<ref>{{cite book |last=Waxman |first=Zo\u00eb |authorlink=|title=Writing the Holocaust: Identity, Testimony, Representation |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=2006 |isbn=0-19-920638-4 |page=168}}</ref> \n\nRumors about the origins and meaning of \"RIF\" soap extended into the concentration camps themselves. Naphtali Karchmer, in his book ''Solitary in the Overwhelming Turbulence: Five Years as Prisoner-of-War in East Prussia'', describes his years in captivity as a Jewish-Polish POW. The author writes about gray, rectangular, low-quality pieces of soap he and other POWs received with the letters \"RIF\" inscribed on a center depression. These were claimed to be made out of only \"''{{lang|de|Rein Judisches Fett}}''\" (pure Jewish fat) when prisoners complained about the low-foam, smooth soap. A version of the story is included in ''[[Black Book (World War II)|The Complete Black Book of Russian Jewry]]'', one of the earliest collections of firsthand accounts of the [[Holocaust]], assembled by Soviet writers [[Ilya Ehrenburg]] and [[Vasily Grossman]]. The specific story is part of a report titled \"The Extermination of the Jews of Lvov\" attributed to I. Herts and Naftali Nakht:\n\n{{quote|In another section of the Belzec camp was an enormous soap factory. The Germans picked out the fattest Jews, murdered them, and boiled them down for soap.

However, the IPN maintained that human fat was used, based on testimonies which were delivered in 1945 and the presence of [[kaolin]] in the samples, the abrasive qualities of which indicated its possible use as a cleaning soap.<ref name=TomSem/> Tomkiewicz and Semk\u00f3w's research, however, concluded that Spanner, a well-respected physician who was nominated for the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 1939, would not have been \"experimenting\" with soap production (which was widely understood and not something which needed experimentation) instead of teaching his students, and that the soapy grease (claimed to be \"unfinished soap\"<ref name=Neander/>), a by-product stemming from [[Maceration (bone)|bone maceration]] in the creation of anatomical models for the institute, was injected into the models flexible joints.<ref name=TomSem/> They further noted that Spanner had previously done research on kaolin injections into cadavers, and stated that the kaolin could have come from the cadaver itself, rather than from a later additive.<ref name=TomSem/>\n\nBoth Neander, and Tomkiewicz and Semk\u00f3w, state that the origin of this myth comes from the findings of bodies and maceration processes in a small brick building on the premise the anatomical institute which was used by the [[Soviet Union|Soviets]] and the newly established Polish [[Chief Commission for the Prosecution of Crimes against the Polish Nation]] as \"proof\" of human soap production in concentration camps, which had been presented as fact and had also become a stock phrase in Soviet propaganda, but of which no evidence could be found in the liberated camps. The \"human soap\" which was found in Danzig was conflated with the separate rumors regarding the concentration camps and they were presented together during the Nuremberg trials.<ref name=Neander/><ref name=TomSem/> Neander concludes that no research, experiments or production on soap-making were conducted in Danzig, that Manzur never made soap according to his \"recipe\", that the corpses which were delivered to be boiled and turned into anatomical models were all the corpses of Germans who had not been killed in order to \"harvest\" their bodies.

Germany suffered a shortage of fats during World War II, and the production of soap was put under government control. The \"human soap\" rumours may have originated from the bars of soap being marked with the initials RIF, which was interpreted by some as ''{{lang|de|Rein-Judisches-Fett}}'' (\"Pure Jewish Fat\"); in [[Blackletter#Fraktur|German Blackletter]] font the difference between I and J is only in length. RIF in fact stood for ''{{lang|de|Reichsstelle f\u00fcr industrielle Fettversorgung}}'' (\"National Center for Industrial Fat Provisioning\", the German government agency responsible for wartime production and distribution of soap and washing products). RIF soap was a poor quality substitute product that contained no fat at all, human or otherwise.<ref>{{cite book |last=Waxman |first=Zo\u00eb |authorlink=|title=Writing the Holocaust: Identity, Testimony, Representation |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=2006 |isbn=0-19-920638-4 |page=168}}</ref> \n\nRumors about the origins and meaning of \"RIF\" soap extended into the concentration camps themselves. Naphtali Karchmer, in his book ''Solitary in the Overwhelming Turbulence: Five Years as Prisoner-of-War in East Prussia'', describes his years in captivity as a Jewish-Polish POW. The author writes about gray, rectangular, low-quality pieces of soap he and other POWs received with the letters \"RIF\" inscribed on a center depression. These were claimed to be made out of only \"''{{lang|de|Rein Judisches Fett}}''\" (pure Jewish fat) when prisoners complained about the low-foam, smooth soap. A version of the story is included in ''[[Black Book (World War II)|The Complete Black Book of Russian Jewry]]'', one of the earliest collections of firsthand accounts of the [[Holocaust]], assembled by Soviet writers [[Ilya Ehrenburg]] and [[Vasily Grossman]]. The specific story is part of a report titled \"The Extermination of the Jews of Lvov\" attributed to I.

However, his research did prove that towards the end of the war, the grease was used for simple cleaning purposes and that Spanner bore responsibility for this, whether he was aware of it or not, as head of the institute, but that the handling of dead bodies amounted to a [[misdemeanor]], as opposed to any criminal behavior, let alone a crime against humanity or involvement in any genocidal activities, something which is today officially acknowledged in Poland.<ref name=Neander/>\n\nTomkiewicz and Semk\u00f3w write that when [[Zofia Na\u0142kowska]], Vice-Chairperson of the Chief Commission, was already writing her short-story \"Professor Spanner\" (which would be published in ''Medaliony''), Spanner was again working as a medical doctor, under his own name, in [[Province of Schleswig-Holstein|Schleswig-Holstein]] in September 1945, unaware that he was being linked to any possible crimes. He was arrested in May 1947, but was released three days later. Later he was arrested again, but he was once again released after explaining how he had conducted the maceration and injection process. He was officially exonerated in 1948 and resumed his academic career.<ref name=TomSem/>\nNeander states: {{quote|The time therefore has come to reduce the \"Danzig Soap Case,\" inflated by postwar propaganda to a prime example of Nazi German crimes, to its real\ndimensions. \"Revisionists\" would lose one of their favorite \"arguments\" in their efforts to discredit serious Holocaust scholarship. Moreover, de-demonizing \"Profesor Spanner\" would dismantle a popular Polish anti-German stereotype and would contribute to a better mutual understanding.
