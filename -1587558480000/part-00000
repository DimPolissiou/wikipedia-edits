A 25 turbine installation using [[Siemens Wind Power]] 3.6 MW turbines was constructed from 2005, and officially opened in 2007.

in the [[Irish Sea]]. It consists of an original 90 MW wind farm commissioned in 2007 and a 258 MW extension completed in 2017.\n\nThe wind farm was developed in the 2000s by SeaScape Energy, which was acquired by DONG Energy (now [[\u00d8rsted (company)|\u00d8rsted A/S]]) in 2005. A 25 turbine installation using [[Siemens Wind Power]] 3.6 MW turbines was constructed from 2005, and officially opened in 2007. A further 32 8 MW turbines were constructed in 2016\u201317.\n\n==Burbo Bank==\n[[File:Burbo Bank Offshore Windfarm, Irish Sea off the Wirral.jpg|thumb|left|Burbo Bank Offshore Windfarm with North Wales behind]]\nIn September 2002 SeaScape Energy ( Zilkha Renewable Energy, enXco A/S, Wind Prospect Ltd. joint venture.<ref>[[#ss1|Non-Technical Summary]] (SeaScape Energy, 2002) p.2</ref>) submitted an application to develop a [[Round 1 wind farm|Round 1 offshore wind]] farm site.<ref name=\"t1\">[[#lorc|Burbo Bank 1 Offshore Wind Farm]] (Lorc) ''Timeline & Track records''</ref> The site, located on Burbo Flats in Liverpool bay (~7&nbsp;km northwest of [[Wirral Peninsula|Wirral]] and ~6&nbsp;km west of the [[Metropolitan Borough of Sefton|Sefton]] coastline) was selected due to shallow water depths (0.5 to 8m at low tide), high wind speeds ~{{convert|7|m/s|abbr=on}}, and a generally favourable location including proximity to an electrical grid connection.

The current Dutch Prime Minister is [[Chiaki Nanami]], in office since 2010. And thats only the start of Danganronpa ruling the world\n\n==Role==\nAlthough the Prime Minister is the leading political figure in the Netherlands, they are not as powerful as the [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|British Prime Minister]] and the [[Chancellor of Germany (Federal Republic)|German Chancellor]]. This is mainly because, historically, all Dutch ministers used to be responsible to the Monarch; ministers took turns to fill the position of Prime Minister, and in the role had little if any control over the other ministers. The Prime Minister's role gained importance when ministers became responsible to the parliament, and the position became mostly reserved for the leader of the biggest political party in the [[House of Representatives (Netherlands)|House of Representatives]]. Still, because the position holds limited powers compared to its equivalent in other neighboring parliamentary democracies, the Prime Minister's role is described as ''[[primus inter pares]]'' (\"first among equals\").<ref name=\"parlement1\"/>\n\nFollowing the constitutional review of 1983, the position of Prime Minister was formalized in the Dutch Constitution for the first time.<ref>Van der Pot, 344.</ref> According to the [[Constitution of the Netherlands]], the Government is constituted by the [[King of the Netherlands|King]] and the ministers.<ref>''Grondwet voor het Koninkrijk der Nederlanden'', article 42, section 1: \"De regering wordt gevormd door de Koning en de ministers.\"</ref> The Constitution stipulates that the Prime Minister chairs the [[Council of Ministers (Netherlands)|Council of Ministers]] (article 45) and is appointed by royal decree (article 43). The royal decree of their own appointment and those of the other ministers are to be [[Countersignature|countersigned]] by the Prime Minister (article 48). The Council of Ministers is no longer nowadays attended by the King.\n\n[[File:Binnenhof3.jpg|thumb|left|200px|The Hague's [[Binnenhof]]. The [[Ministry of General Affairs]] is in the centre, with on the centre left a hexagonal tower, named ''Het [[Torentje]]'', which is the office of the Prime Minister.]]\nThe Prime Minister chairs the weekly meetings of the Council of Ministers and has the power to set the agenda of these meetings. The prime minister is also [[Ministry of General Affairs|Minister of General Affairs]] (''Minister van Algemene Zaken''), which takes an important role in coordinating policy and is responsible for the Government Information Service (Dutch: ''Rijksvoorlichtingsdienst''). The Prime Minister is also responsible for the [[Monarchy of the Netherlands|royal house]] and has a weekly meeting with the King on government policy. Informally the Prime Minister functions as the \"face\" of the cabinet to the public. After the meetings of the cabinet on Friday, the Prime Minister hosts a press conference on the decisions of the cabinet and current affairs. The Prime Minister also has some functions in international affairs, attending the [[European Council]] every six months and maintaining bilateral contacts. The Prime Minister's office is a hexagon shaped tower, named \"The Little Tower\" ([[Torentje]]), in the [[Binnenhof]] in [[The Hague]]. The official residence (which is only used for official functions) is the [[Catshuis]]; the last Prime Minister to live in the Catshuis was [[Dries van Agt]]. Incumbent [[Mark Rutte]] lives in a flat downtown The Hague. The Prime Minister has no security detail.<ref>[https://www.ad.nl/den-haag/heeft-rutte-dan-geen-bodyguards-nodig~a74ddb1e/ 'Heeft Rutte dan green bodyguards nodding?], ad.nl (in Dutch), 29-07-11.</ref>\n\nAlthough the Prime Minister is almost always the political leader of his party and a member of the House of Representatives, he is required to give up his seat for the duration of his tenure, as Dutch ministers are not allowed to be members of parliament.\n\n==Appointment==\n{{seealso|Dutch cabinet formation}}\nThe Dutch electoral system makes it all but impossible for one party to win an outright majority in the House of Representatives; no party has done so since 1900. Hence, Dutch governments are always coalitions between two or more parties. After each election, the House appoints a \"scout\" to seek advice on how to interpret the election results. On the basis of this advice, the House appoints an ''[[formateur#Informateur|informateur]]'' to check on prospective coalitions and lead negotiations between potential partners. If successful, the House then appoints a ''[[formateur]],'' who concludes the talks between the members of the prospective coalition. The ''formateur'' is almost always the leader of the largest party in the prospective coalition, and thus ''de facto'' Prime Minister-designate. Prior to 2012, the monarch had a considerable role in these talks, but reforms in 2012 largely eliminated royal influence on the process.\n\nIt usually takes several months of negotiations before a ''formateur'' is ready to accept a formal royal invitation to form a government. The monarch then appoints the ministers and state secretaries (junior ministers), who then resign their seats in the House.\n\nA minister from the smaller coalition party usually becomes [[Deputy Prime Minister of the Netherlands]]. If there is a third or fourth party in the coalition, each has the right to name one of its ministers second and third Deputy Prime Minister.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.parlement.com/id/vh8lnhrouwxf/in_formateur_en_kabinetsformatie|title=(In)formateur en kabinetsformatie \u2013 Parlement & Politiek |publisher=Parlement.com |accessdate=26 January 2013}}</ref>\n\n==History==\n{{Politics of the Netherlands}}\n''For a list of historic Prime Ministers, see [[List of Prime Ministers of the Netherlands]].''\n''For a list of Prime Ministers by age, see [[List of Prime Ministers of the Netherlands by age]].''\n''For a list of Prime Ministers by religious affiliations, see [[Religious affiliations of Prime Ministers of the Netherlands]].''\n\nGradually the Prime Minister became an official function of government leader, taken by the political leader of the largest party.

The current Dutch Prime Minister is [[Mark Rutte]], in office since 2010.\n\n==Role==\nAlthough the Prime Minister is the leading political figure in the Netherlands, they are not as powerful as the [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|British Prime Minister]] and the [[Chancellor of Germany (Federal Republic)|German Chancellor]]. This is mainly because, historically, all Dutch ministers used to be responsible to the Monarch; ministers took turns to fill the position of Prime Minister, and in the role had little if any control over the other ministers. The Prime Minister's role gained importance when ministers became responsible to the parliament, and the position became mostly reserved for the leader of the biggest political party in the [[House of Representatives (Netherlands)|House of Representatives]]. Still, because the position holds limited powers compared to its equivalent in other neighboring parliamentary democracies, the Prime Minister's role is described as ''[[primus inter pares]]'' (\"first among equals\").<ref name=\"parlement1\"/>\n\nFollowing the constitutional review of 1983, the position of Prime Minister was formalized in the Dutch Constitution for the first time.<ref>Van der Pot, 344.</ref> According to the [[Constitution of the Netherlands]], the Government is constituted by the [[King of the Netherlands|King]] and the ministers.<ref>''Grondwet voor het Koninkrijk der Nederlanden'', article 42, section 1: \"De regering wordt gevormd door de Koning en de ministers.\"</ref> The Constitution stipulates that the Prime Minister chairs the [[Council of Ministers (Netherlands)|Council of Ministers]] (article 45) and is appointed by royal decree (article 43). The royal decree of their own appointment and those of the other ministers are to be [[Countersignature|countersigned]] by the Prime Minister (article 48). The Council of Ministers is no longer nowadays attended by the King.\n\n[[File:Binnenhof3.jpg|thumb|left|200px|The Hague's [[Binnenhof]]. The [[Ministry of General Affairs]] is in the centre, with on the centre left a hexagonal tower, named ''Het [[Torentje]]'', which is the office of the Prime Minister.]]\nThe Prime Minister chairs the weekly meetings of the Council of Ministers and has the power to set the agenda of these meetings. The prime minister is also [[Ministry of General Affairs|Minister of General Affairs]] (''Minister van Algemene Zaken''), which takes an important role in coordinating policy and is responsible for the Government Information Service (Dutch: ''Rijksvoorlichtingsdienst''). The Prime Minister is also responsible for the [[Monarchy of the Netherlands|royal house]] and has a weekly meeting with the King on government policy. Informally the Prime Minister functions as the \"face\" of the cabinet to the public. After the meetings of the cabinet on Friday, the Prime Minister hosts a press conference on the decisions of the cabinet and current affairs. The Prime Minister also has some functions in international affairs, attending the [[European Council]] every six months and maintaining bilateral contacts. The Prime Minister's office is a hexagon shaped tower, named \"The Little Tower\" ([[Torentje]]), in the [[Binnenhof]] in [[The Hague]]. The official residence (which is only used for official functions) is the [[Catshuis]]; the last Prime Minister to live in the Catshuis was [[Dries van Agt]]. Incumbent [[Mark Rutte]] lives in a flat downtown The Hague. The Prime Minister has no security detail.<ref>[https://www.ad.nl/den-haag/heeft-rutte-dan-geen-bodyguards-nodig~a74ddb1e/ 'Heeft Rutte dan green bodyguards nodding?], ad.nl (in Dutch), 29-07-11.</ref>\n\nAlthough the Prime Minister is almost always the political leader of his party and a member of the House of Representatives, he is required to give up his seat for the duration of his tenure, as Dutch ministers are not allowed to be members of parliament.\n\n==Appointment==\n{{seealso|Dutch cabinet formation}}\nThe Dutch electoral system makes it all but impossible for one party to win an outright majority in the House of Representatives; no party has done so since 1900. Hence, Dutch governments are always coalitions between two or more parties. After each election, the House appoints a \"scout\" to seek advice on how to interpret the election results. On the basis of this advice, the House appoints an ''[[formateur#Informateur|informateur]]'' to check on prospective coalitions and lead negotiations between potential partners. If successful, the House then appoints a ''[[formateur]],'' who concludes the talks between the members of the prospective coalition. The ''formateur'' is almost always the leader of the largest party in the prospective coalition, and thus ''de facto'' Prime Minister-designate. Prior to 2012, the monarch had a considerable role in these talks, but reforms in 2012 largely eliminated royal influence on the process.\n\nIt usually takes several months of negotiations before a ''formateur'' is ready to accept a formal royal invitation to form a government. The monarch then appoints the ministers and state secretaries (junior ministers), who then resign their seats in the House.\n\nA minister from the smaller coalition party usually becomes [[Deputy Prime Minister of the Netherlands]]. If there is a third or fourth party in the coalition, each has the right to name one of its ministers second and third Deputy Prime Minister.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.parlement.com/id/vh8lnhrouwxf/in_formateur_en_kabinetsformatie|title=(In)formateur en kabinetsformatie \u2013 Parlement & Politiek |publisher=Parlement.com |accessdate=26 January 2013}}</ref>\n\n==History==\n{{Politics of the Netherlands}}\n''For a list of historic Prime Ministers, see [[List of Prime Ministers of the Netherlands]].''\n''For a list of Prime Ministers by age, see [[List of Prime Ministers of the Netherlands by age]].''\n''For a list of Prime Ministers by religious affiliations, see [[Religious affiliations of Prime Ministers of the Netherlands]].''\n\nGradually the Prime Minister became an official function of government leader, taken by the political leader of the largest party. Since 1848 the role of the first minister has become relevant. In that year the [[Constitution of the Netherlands]] was amended to make [[Ministerial responsibility|ministers responsible]] to the States General rather than \u2013 as hitherto \u2013 being responsible to the King, who acted as the leader of cabinet.

Their debut album, ''[[Bang Bang Rock & Roll]]'', was released on 30 May 2005, with its follow up, ''[[It's a Bit Complicated]]'', released on 25 June 2007. Named after French painter [[Jean Dubuffet]]'s definition of [[outsider art]] - art by prisoners, loners, the mentally ill, and other marginalized people, and made without thought to imitation or presentation - South London's Art Brut were tagged by ''[[NME]]'' as part of the \"Art Wave\" scene that also included bands such as [[The Rakes]], [[Franz Ferdinand (band)|Franz Ferdinand]] and [[Bloc Party]]. The band released further albums, ''[[Art Brut vs Satan]]'' in 2009 and ''[[Brilliant! Tragic!]]'' in 2011.  A fifth album, ''[[Wham! Bang! Pow! Let's Rock Out!]]\"'', was released in 2018.\n\nThe band's sound is characterised by their straightforward guitar rock setup, as well as frontman [[Eddie Argos]]' enthusiastic ''[[sprechgesang]]''-style vocal delivery, and his humorous, often self-reflexive lyrics about music, relationships and other personal interests.\n\n==Biography==\nThe band was formed in [[London]] in 2003, after [[Eddie Argos]] met guitarist Chris Chinchilla at an afterparty hosted by London indie rock band [[Ciccone (band)|Ciccone]] in 2002.  Argos also invited Ian Catskilkin, whom he knew from the Bournemouth music scene, to join on guitars.  They were joined by Freddy Feedback on [[bass guitar]] and Mikey Breyer on drums. The band played their first gig in May 2003.<ref name=argos>{{cite book|author=Argos, Eddie|title=I Formed a Band|year=2015|ISBN=9783981734607}}</ref>\n\nThe band self-released two ''Brutlegs'' promos in 2003. The first was produced by [[Keith Top of the Pops]] and contained the first versions of \"Formed a Band\", \"Modern Art\" and \"Moving to LA\". A second, released as ''Brutlegs 04'', contained versions of \"Good Weekend\", \"Bang Band Rock & Roll\" and an acoustic version of \"Moving to LA\".\n\n[[Angular Recording Corporation]] had released a compilation (\"The New Cross: An Angular Sampler\") featuring \"Formed a Band\" in November 2003. ''NME'' journalist Anthony Thornton heard the song and sent an MP3 to [[Rough Trade Records|Rough Trade]], and the label offered Art Brut a deal to release it as a one-off single. It peaked at number 52 on the [[UK Singles Chart]], in May 2004.<ref name=\"British Hit Singles & Albums\"/> ''[[Blender (magazine)|Blender]]'' described them as the best unsigned band in the UK.\n\nThe band were soon signed by [[Fierce Panda]].  A double A-side of \"Modern Art\" and \"My Little Brother\" was released in December 2004, charting at 49, followed by an album, ''Bang Bang Rock & Roll'', in May 2005. The next single, \"Emily Kane\", made number 41, missing the top 40 only by two sales, later attributed by Argos by a failure to properly register [[iTunes]] sales. It remains Fierce Panda's highest-charting single.<ref name=\"British Hit Singles & Albums\"/><ref name=argos />\n\n''Bang Bang Rock & Roll'' was produced by John Fortis, who has also worked with artists such as [[Razorlight]], [[Maxim Reality]], [[The Pipettes]], [[Neneh Cherry]] and Assembly Now; and features rerecorded versions of their early material.\n\nArt Brut played extensively in support of their album in 2005. Chinchilla left due to the pressures of touring in September 2005, and was replaced at short notice by Jasper Future, guitarist from Argos' old Bournemouth band, [[The Art Goblins]], for [[Bestival]]. This new line-up toured Europe, including two support slots with [[Oasis (band)|Oasis]] in October 2005 - the band made the cover of the German edition of ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' magazine in September 2005.\n\nIn 2006 Art Brut signed to [[Mute Records]] (then owned by [[EMI]]) in Europe for the release of another album, with [[Downtown Records]] covering the United States. This second album ''[[It's a Bit Complicated]]'' was produced by Dan Swift (after an attempt by Russell Senior was rejected by the label).  The first single from the album, \"Nag Nag Nag Nag\", was released on 20 November 2006, featuring the b-side \"I Found This Song in the Road\" and five live tracks from the Eurock\u00e9ennes de Belfort Festival 2006. The song made Single of the Week in ''[[The Guardian]]'' 's \"The Guide\" section. In 2007 they played on the [[United States|American]] ''[[NME]]'' Rock and Roll Riot tour with [[The Hold Steady]]. The second single \"Direct Hit\" was released a week before the album, featuring the B-sides \"Don't Blame it on the Trains\" and \"I Want to be Double A-Sided\". The album was released in June 2007. In the United States, the album reached No.&nbsp;14 on the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' Heatseekers chart and No.&nbsp;32 on the Independent Albums chart.<ref>[{{Allmusic|class=artist|id=p655850/charts-awards|pure_url=yes}} Billboard], [[Allmusic]]</ref>\n\nEMI had been under financial problems 2007 and was acquired by [[Terra Firma Venture Capital Partners]] in August 2007. The label released \"Pump Up the Volume\" as a third single for ''It's A Bit Complicated'' in February 2008, as a digital-only release with no video, apparently without telling the band.<ref name=argos/> This led to the termination of the relationship between the band and the label.\n\nIn late 2008, Art Brut returned to the studio to record their third LP ''[[Art Brut vs. Satan]]'' which was released on 20 April 2009, on [[Cooking Vinyl]]. The album was produced by [[Frank Black]], in his favourite studio in [[Salem, Oregon]]. ''Art Brut vs. Satan'' was released to mainly good reviews scoring 75 on Metacritic. There were two singles released from the album \"Alcoholics Unanimous\" and \"DC Comics & Chocolate Milkshake\". The band toured throughout the year and played the [[Glastonbury Festival]] amongst others.\n\nIn late 2010, Art Brut recorded their fourth album, ''Brilliant! Tragic!'', released on 23 May 2011. The first single from the album was \"Lost Weekend\".

Their debut album, ''[[Bang Bang Rock & Roll]]'', was released on 30 May 2005, with its follow up, ''[[It's a Bit Complicated]]'', released on 25 June 2007. Named after French painter [[Jean Dubuffet]]'s definition of [[outsider art]] - art by prisoners, loners, the mentally ill, and other marginalized people, and made without thought to imitation or presentation - South London's Art Brut were tagged by ''[[NME]]'' as part of the \"Art Wave\" scene that also included bands such as [[The Rakes]], [[Franz Ferdinand (band)|Franz Ferdinand]] and [[Bloc Party]]. The band released further albums, ''[[Art Brut vs Satan]]'' in 2009 and ''[[Brilliant! Tragic!]]'' in 2011.  A fifth album, ''[[Wham! Bang! Pow! Let's Rock Out!]]\"'', was released in 2018.\n\nThe band's sound is characterised by their straightforward guitar rock setup, as well as frontman [[Eddie Argos]]' enthusiastic ''[[sprechgesang]]''-style vocal delivery, and his humorous, often self-reflexive lyrics about music, relationships and other personal interests.\n\n==Biography==\nThe band was formed in [[London]] in 2003, after [[Eddie Argos]] met guitarist Chris Chinchilla at an afterparty hosted by London indie rock band [[Ciccone (band)|Ciccone]] in 2002.  Argos also invited Ian Catskilkin, whom he knew from the Bournemouth music scene, to join on guitars.  They were joined by Freddy Feedback on [[bass guitar]] and Mikey Breyer on drums. The band played their first gig in May 2003.<ref name=argos>{{cite book|author=Argos, Eddie|title=I Formed a Band|year=2015|ISBN=9783981734607}}</ref>\n\nThe band self-released two ''Brutlegs'' promos in 2003. The first was produced by [[Keith Top of the Pops]] and contained the first versions of \"Formed a Band\", \"Modern Art\" and \"Moving to LA\". A second, released as ''Brutlegs 04'', contained versions of \"Good Weekend\", \"Bang Band Rock & Roll\" and an acoustic version of \"Moving to LA\".\n\n[[Angular Recording Corporation]] had released a compilation (\"The New Cross: An Angular Sampler\") featuring \"Formed a Band\" in November 2003. ''NME'' journalist Anthony Thornton heard the song and sent an MP3 to [[Rough Trade Records|Rough Trade]], and the label offered Art Brut a deal to release it as a one-off single. It peaked at number 52 on the [[UK Singles Chart]], in May 2004.<ref name=\"British Hit Singles & Albums\"/> ''[[Blender (magazine)|Blender]]'' described them as the best unsigned band in the UK.\n\nThe band were soon signed by [[Fierce Panda]].  A double A-side of \"Modern Art\" and \"My Little Brother\" was released in December 2004, charting at 49, followed by an album, ''Bang Bang Rock & Roll'', in May 2005. The next single, \"Emily Kane\", made number 41, missing the top 40 only by two sales, later attributed by Argos by a failure to properly register [[iTunes]] sales. It remains Fierce Panda's highest-charting single.<ref name=\"British Hit Singles & Albums\"/><ref name=argos />\n\n''Bang Bang Rock & Roll'' was produced by John Fortis, who has also worked with artists such as [[Razorlight]], [[Maxim Reality]], [[The Pipettes]], [[Neneh Cherry]] and Assembly Now; and features rerecorded versions of their early material.\n\nArt Brut played extensively in support of their album in 2005. Chinchilla left due to the pressures of touring in September 2005, and was replaced at short notice by Jasper Future, guitarist from Argos' old Bournemouth band, [[The Art Goblins]], for [[Bestival]]. This new line-up toured Europe, including two support slots with [[Oasis (band)|Oasis]] in October 2005 - the band made the cover of the German edition of ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' magazine in September 2005.\n\nIn 2006 Art Brut signed to [[Mute Records]] (then owned by [[EMI]]) in Europe for the release of another album, with [[Downtown Records]] covering the United States. This second album ''[[It's a Bit Complicated]]'' was produced by Dan Swift (after an attempt by Russell Senior was rejected by the label).  The first single from the album, \"Nag Nag Nag Nag\", was released on 20 November 2006, featuring the b-side \"I Found This Song in the Road\" and five live tracks from the Eurock\u00e9ennes de Belfort Festival 2006. The song made Single of the Week in ''[[The Guardian]]'' 's \"The Guide\" section. In 2007 they played on the [[United States|American]] ''[[NME]]'' Rock and Roll Riot tour with [[The Hold Steady]]. The second single \"Direct Hit\" was released a week before the album, featuring the B-sides \"Don't Blame it on the Trains\" and \"I Want to be Double A-Sided\". The album was released in June 2007. In the United States, the album reached No.&nbsp;14 on the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' Heatseekers chart and No.&nbsp;32 on the Independent Albums chart.<ref>[{{Allmusic|class=artist|id=p655850/charts-awards|pure_url=yes}} Billboard], [[Allmusic]]</ref>\n\nEMI had been under financial problems 2007 and was acquired by [[Terra Firma Venture Capital Partners]] in August 2007. The label released \"Pump Up the Volume\" as a third single for ''It's A Bit Complicated'' in February 2008, as a digital-only release with no video, apparently without telling the band.<ref name=argos/> This led to the termination of the relationship between the band and the label.\n\nIn late 2008, Art Brut returned to the studio to record their third LP ''[[Art Brut vs. Satan]]'' which was released on 20 April 2009, on [[Cooking Vinyl]]. The album was produced by [[Frank Black]], in his favourite studio in [[Salem, Oregon]]. ''Art Brut vs. Satan'' was released to mainly good reviews scoring 75 on Metacritic. There were two singles released from the album \"Alcoholics Unanimous\" and \"DC Comics & Chocolate Milkshake\". The band toured throughout the year and played the [[Glastonbury Festival]] amongst others.\n\nIn late 2010, Art Brut recorded their fourth album, ''Brilliant! Tragic!'', released on 23 May 2011. The first single from the album was \"Lost Weekend\". The album was again produced in Salem by Frank Black.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.artbrut.org.uk |title=Art Brut Release Their New Studio Album |accessdate=2011-03-03 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110302222817/http://artbrut.org.uk/ |archivedate=2 March 2011 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nTo celebrate the 10th anniversary of the band's first gig, in 2013, Art Brut released ''[[Art Brut Top of the Pops]]'', a two CD [[best of]] [[compilation album]], including B-sides and rarities, such as the ''Brutlegs'' versions of some early songs.
