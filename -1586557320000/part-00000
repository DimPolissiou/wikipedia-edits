He was enrolled as an Advocate with the Bar Council of Punjab and Haryana on 16 July 1974. He practised before the High Court of Punjab and Haryana for about five years and before the Supreme Court of India and Delhi High Court for about 22 years.

Thereafter, he was appointed as the Chairperson of the National Green Tribunal, New Delhi.\n\n== Notable Judgments ==\nIn Pradyuman Bisht vs. Union of India & Ors. case of installation of CCTV cameras in Courts, Tribunals, the Bench headed by Justice Goel and Justice Lalit held that by installation of CCTV cameras the objective of transparent judicial system can be achieved.\n\nJustice Goel initiated the idea of usage of technology in matrimonial dispute. In Krishna Veni Nigam vs. Harish Nigam, the Bench was of the opinion that, \u201ctools like video conferencing should be used in matrimonial cases where the place of adjudication is not convenient to either of the parties.\u201d The Bench further said that, \"it may be appropriate that available technology of video conferencing is used where both the parties have equal difficulty and there is no place which is convenient to both the parties.\" \n\nJustice Goel\u2019s judgment on prevention of misuse of SC/ST Act in Dr. Shubhash Kashinath Mahajan vs. The State of Maharashtra, is one of the much talked about decision. Justice Goel along with Justice Lalit examined the question on the inclusion of procedural safeguards so that the provisions of Scheduled Castes and the Scheduled Tribes (Prevention of Atrocities) (SC/ST) Act 1989 are not abused for extraneous considerations.

While giving the guidelines, he observed that, \u201cIt is a matter of serious concern that large number of cases continues to be filed under Section 498A alleging harassment of married women. To remedy the situation, we are of the view that involvement of civil society in the aid of administration of justice can be one of the steps, apart from the investigating officers and the concerned trial courts being sensitized. It is also necessary to facilitate closure of proceedings where a genuine settlement has been reached instead of parties being required to move High Court only for that purpose\u201d. \n\nWith a view to achieve a progressive step, Justice Goel in his judgment in Amardeep Singh vs. Harveen Kaur ., held that, \u201cthe 6 months waiting period prescribed under Section 13B(2) of Hindu Marriage Act for divorce by mutual consent is not mandatory, and can be waived under certain circumstances.\n\nFurther, in B.Sunitha vs. The State of State of Telangana he also gave his opinion and asked the government to take cognizance on the issue of introducing requisite legislative changes for a regulatory mechanism to check violation of professional ethics by Lawyers. \n\n==Justice Goel as Chairperson of National Green Tribunal ==\n\nJustice A.

When hatched the [[tadpole]]s are recognizable by their skinny tails in relation to the size of their black bodies. They may advance to adulthood in 50\u201365 days. When metamorphosis is completed, the \"toadlets\" may stay in the water for a short period of time before they become mostly land based. Often entire groups of tadpoles reach the ''toadlet'' stage at once and a mass migration to higher ground takes place usually to shaded areas of mid range and upland forests bordering the marshes from where they bred. Toadlets can be observed eating microscopic bugs as fast as they can in the ground area they roam between various vegetation; they are also known to eat ants, spiders, slugs and worms. Studies have shown that they have a mutualistic relationship with ''[[Chlorogonium]]'' algae, which makes tadpoles develop faster than normal.{{citation needed|date=June 2013}}\n\nTadpoles have several mechanisms to reduce predation.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://animaldiversity.ummz.umich.edu/site/accounts/information/Bufo_americanus.html |title=ADW: Bufo americanus: Information |publisher=Animaldiversity.ummz.umich.edu |date= |accessdate=2011-04-01}}</ref> They avoid predators by swimming in very shallow water often with thick grass vegetation, and by swimming close together in schools during the day.

Skin color can change depending on habitat colors, humidity, stress, and temperature. Color changes range from yellow to brown to black, from solid colors to speckled. Their breeding habits are very similar to ''[[Anaxyrus fowleri]]''. The call or voice of a breeding male is a high trill, lasting 6\u201330 seconds,<ref name=\"autogenerated1975\"/> similar to a ringing telephone. They hibernate during the winter. The eastern American toad has spots that contain only one to two warts. It also has enlarged warts on the tibia or lower leg below the knee. While the belly is usually spotted, in some areas many are, and it is generally more so on the forward half (in some rare individuals there may be few or no spots). This subspecies of the American toad has no or very little markings on it. The spades on the back legs are blackish. Some toads of this subspecies have a more pervasive red and deep brown color, many with red warts on their bodies. Also eastern American toads have parotoid glands that are the same color as the surrounding skin. The glands don't usually have any patterning on them.\n\nOther species that may be confused with the eastern American toad are [[Fowler's toad]], which has three or more warts in the largest dark spots, and in the far west of its range [[woodhouse's toad]]. Fowler's toad can be especially difficult to identify in comparison to the eastern American toad but one difference is that it never has a spotted belly and both cranial crests touch the [[parotoid gland]]s. Also, Fowler's toads are very fast hoppers (bursts of 5\u201310 fast hops) in comparison to Eastern toads lethargic, casual hopping and walking locomotion. In the eastern American toad these crests almost never touch the parotoid glands, which secrete [[bufotoxin]], a poisonous substance meant to make the toad unpalatable to potential predators. [[Bufotoxin]] is a mild poison in comparison to that of other poisonous toads and frogs, but it can irritate human eyes and mucous membranes<ref>{{cite web |last1=Lannoo |first1=Michael |title=Amphibian Declines: The Conservation Status of United States Species |url=https://amphibiaweb.org/species/100 |website=Amphibiaweb |publisher=Regents of the University of California |accessdate=8 May 2019}}</ref> and is dangerous to smaller animals (such as dogs) when ingested.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Vigil |first1=Stacey |last2=Mengak |first2=Michael |title=American Toad (Bufo americanus) |journal=WSFS Natural History Series |date=October 2006 |volume=7 |pages=2\u20133 }}</ref>\n\nAmerican toads require a semi-permanent freshwater pond or pool with shallow water in which to breed, to gather their water suppliers in times of drought or as a routine,<ref name=\"autogenerated1975\"/> and for their early development. They also require dense patches of vegetation, for cover and hunting grounds. Given these two things and a supply of insects for food, American toads can live almost everywhere, ranging from forests to flat grassland. Females when caught are silent and easily tamed, adapting to terrarium life readily, while the smaller males are readily communicative. The smaller males do not adapt well to terrarium life and should be released after a few days of observation. Adult toads are mostly nocturnal, although juveniles are often abroad by day. When it rains, these toads will become active and can be observed eating robustly worms and insects leaving their burrows and walking in front of an opportunist toad. These toads are 'creatures of habit' once they have a certain area they prefer to live within... an acre of wooded forest with water in proximity for soaking, a home with cool ledges and window wells; they commonly seek cover in burrows, under boardwalks, flat stones, boards, logs, wood piles, or other cover. When cold weather comes, these toads dig backwards and bury themselves in the dirt of their summer homes, or they may choose another site in which to [[hibernation|hibernate]].<ref name=ref1/> Their diet includes [[cricket (insect)|crickets]], [[mealworm]]s, [[earthworm]]s, [[ant]]s, [[spider]]s, [[slug]]s, [[centipede]]s, [[moth]]s, and other small invertebrates. Some of these toads have been known to live over 30 years and currently a female specimen (over 13 centimeters long) is living healthily into her late 30s. Another female toad of 17 centimeters is known to have existed in Wisconsin from Washington Island on Lake Michigan.\n\nThe eastern American toad may be confused with the [[Canadian toad]] in the area where they overlap, but the cranial crests in the American toad do not join to form a raised \"boss\" (bump) like they do in the Canadian toad. Its range also overlaps with the [[southern toad]]'s, but in this species the cranial crests form two unique knobs.\n\n===Dwarf American toad===\n{{Wikispecies|Anaxyrus americanus charlesmithi}}\nThe dwarf American toad (''A. a. charlesmithi''), is a smaller version of the American toad, which reaches lengths of about {{convert|6|cm|in|frac=4|abbr=on}}, is generally a dark reddish color ranging to light red in some specimens in isolated populations. The spots on the back are reduced or absent, and when present they contain a few small red warts and a black ring around it like in the normal American toad. The warts are always darker than the skin of the toad. Some specimens have a white dorsal line in the middle of their backs. The ventral surface or belly is usually cream colored with a few dark spots in the breast area. This subspecies can be distinguished from the above-mentioned species in the same manner as for the eastern American toad. The southwestern portion of the Dwarf American toad's range overlaps with that of the [[Bufo nebulifer|Gulf Coast toad]]. The latter species is distinguished by the presence of a dark lateral stripe as well as a deep \"valley\" between its prominent cranial crests. It eats mainly spiders, worms and small insects.\n\n===Hudson Bay toad===\nThe [[Hudson Bay toad]] (''A. a. copei'') is a rare Canadian subspecies of ''A. americanus''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.amphibians.ca/american-toad/|title=American toad|publisher=amphibians.ca |work=Frog Toad Newt and Salamander Species of Canada |accessdate=17 August 2013}}</ref> This subspecies of the American toad has been seen in the northern parts of Ontario where there are a few isolated populations. These northern dwarf toads mostly have the red coloring on the sides of their bodies and have an unusually high number of warts for the subspecies. Interbreeding with eastern American toads caused this subspecies to lose the red coloring on their backs.\n\n==Inbreeding avoidance==\nToads display breeding site fidelity, as do many amphibians.

Its range also overlaps with the [[southern toad]]'s, but in this species the cranial crests form two unique knobs.\n\n===Dwarf American toad===\n{{Wikispecies|Anaxyrus americanus charlesmithi}}\nThe dwarf American toad (''A. a. charlesmithi''), is a smaller version of the American toad, which reaches lengths of about {{convert|6|cm|in|frac=4|abbr=on}}, is generally a dark reddish color ranging to light red in some specimens in isolated populations. The spots on the back are reduced or absent, and when present they contain a few small red warts and a black ring around it like in the normal American toad. The warts are always darker than the skin of the toad. Some specimens have a white dorsal line in the middle of their backs. The ventral surface or belly is usually cream colored with a few dark spots in the breast area. This subspecies can be distinguished from the above-mentioned species in the same manner as for the eastern American toad. The southwestern portion of the Dwarf American toad's range overlaps with that of the [[Bufo nebulifer|Gulf Coast toad]]. The latter species is distinguished by the presence of a dark lateral stripe as well as a deep \"valley\" between its prominent cranial crests. It eats mainly spiders, worms and small insects.\n\n===Hudson Bay toad===\nThe [[Hudson Bay toad]] (''A. a. copei'') is a rare Canadian subspecies of ''A. americanus''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.amphibians.ca/american-toad/|title=American toad|publisher=amphibians.ca |work=Frog Toad Newt and Salamander Species of Canada |accessdate=17 August 2013}}</ref> This subspecies of the American toad has been seen in the northern parts of Ontario where there are a few isolated populations. These northern dwarf toads mostly have the red coloring on the sides of their bodies and have an unusually high number of warts for the subspecies. Interbreeding with eastern American toads caused this subspecies to lose the red coloring on their backs.\n\n==Inbreeding avoidance==\nToads display breeding site fidelity, as do many amphibians. Individuals that return to natal ponds to breed will likely encounter siblings as potential mates. Although [[incest]] is possible, ''Anaxyrus americanus'' siblings rarely mate.<ref name=Waldman>{{cite journal | last1 = Waldman | first1 = B | last2 = Rice | first2 = JE | last3 = Honeycutt | first3 = RL | year = 1992 | title = Kin recognition and incest avoidance in toads | url = | journal = Am.

{"title_page": "System call", "text_new": "{{Distinguish|system command}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=January 2013}}\n[[File:Linux kernel interfaces.svg|thumb|300px|A high-level overview of the Linux kernel's system call interface, which handles communication between its various components and the [[userspace]] ]]\n\nIn [[computing]], a '''system call''' is the programmatic way in which a [[computer program]] requests a service from the [[Kernel (computing)|kernel]] of the [[operating system]] it is executed on. This may include hardware-related services (for example, accessing a [[hard disk drive]]), creation and execution of new [[process (computing)|processes]], and communication with integral [[kernel service]]s such as [[process scheduling]].  System calls provide an essential interface between a process and the operating system.\n\nIn most systems, system calls can only be made from [[userspace]] processes, while in some systems, [[OS/360 and successors]] for example, privileged system code also issues system calls.<ref>{{cite manual\n |     author = IBM\n |      title = IBM System/360 Operating System System Programmer's Guide\n |    section = Writing SVC Routines\n | sectionurl =\n |    version = Third Edition\n |  publisher =\n |       date = March 1967\n |        url = http://bitsavers.org/pdf/ibm/360/os/R01-08/C28-6550-2_OSsysPrmg_Mar67.pdf\n |     format = PDF\n |         id = C28-6550-2\n | accessdate =\n |      quote =\n |       page =\n |      pages = 32\u201336\n |        ref =\n }}</ref>\n\n== Privileges ==\nThe [[Instruction set|architecture]] of most modern processors, with the exception of some embedded systems, involves a [[CPU modes|security model]]. For example, the ''[[ring (computer security)|rings]]'' model specifies multiple privilege levels under which software may be executed: a program is usually limited to its own [[address space]] so that it cannot access or modify other running programs or the operating system itself, and is usually prevented from directly manipulating hardware devices (e.g. the [[frame buffer]] or [[Computer network|network]] devices).\n\nHowever, many applications need access to these components, so system calls are made available by the operating system to provide well-defined, safe implementations for such operations. The operating system executes at the highest level of privilege, and allows applications to request services via system calls, which are often initiated via [[interrupt]]s. An interrupt automatically puts the CPU into some elevated privilege level, and then passes control to the kernel, which determines whether the calling program should be granted the requested service. If the service is granted, the kernel executes a specific set of instructions over which the calling program has no direct control, returns the privilege level to that of the calling program, and then returns control to the calling program.\n\n== The library as an intermediary ==\nGenerally, systems provide a [[Library (computing)|library]] or [[API]] that sits between normal programs and the operating system.  On [[Unix-like]] systems, that API is usually part of an implementation of the [[C standard library|C library]] (libc), such as [[glibc]], that provides [[wrapper function]]s for the system calls, often named the same as the system calls they invoke. On [[Windows NT]], that API is part of the [[Native API]], in the <tt>ntdll.dll</tt> library; this is an undocumented API used by implementations of the regular [[Windows API]] and directly used by some system programs on Windows.  The library's wrapper functions expose an ordinary function [[calling convention]] (a [[subroutine]] call on the [[assembly language|assembly]] level) for using the system call, as well as making the system call more [[modularity|modular]]. Here, the primary function of the wrapper is to place all the arguments to be passed to the system call in the appropriate [[processor register]]s (and maybe on the [[call stack]] as well), and also setting a unique system call number for the kernel to call. In this way the library, which exists between the OS and the application, increases [[Software portability|portability]].\n\nThe call to the library function itself does not cause a switch to [[kernel mode]] and is usually a normal [[subroutine call]] (using, for example, a \"CALL\" assembly instruction in some [[Instruction set architecture]]s (ISAs)). The actual system call does transfer control to the kernel (and is more implementation-dependent and platform-dependent than the library call abstracting it). For example, in [[Unix-like]] systems, <code>fork</code> and <code>execve</code> are C library functions that in turn execute instructions that invoke the <code>fork</code> and <code>exec</code> system calls. Making the system call directly in the [[application code]] is more complicated and may require embedded assembly code to be used (in [[C (programming language)|C]] and [[C++]]) as well as knowledge of the low-level binary interface for the system call operation, which may be subject to change over time and thus not be part of the [[application binary interface]]; the library functions are meant to abstract this away.\n\nOn [[exokernel]] based systems, the library is especially important as an intermediary. On exokernels, libraries shield user applications from the very low level kernel [[Application programming interface|API]], and provide [[Abstraction (computer science)|abstractions]] and [[Resource (computer science)|resource]] management.\n\nIBM operating systems descended from [[OS/360 and successors|OS/360]] and [[DOS/360 and successors|DOS/360]], including [[z/OS]] and [[VSE (operating system)|z/VSE]], implement system calls through a library of assembly language [[Macro (computer science)|macros]].  This reflects their origin at a time when programming in assembly language was more common than [[High-level programming language|high-level language]] usage.  IBM system calls are therefore not directly executable by high-level language programs, but require a callable assembly language wrapper subroutine.\n\n== Examples and tools ==\nOn [[Unix]], [[Unix-like]] and other [[POSIX]]-compliant operating systems, popular system calls are <code>[[open (system call)|open]]</code>, <code>[[read (system call)|read]]</code>, <code>[[write (system call)|write]]</code>, <code>[[close (system call)|close]]</code>, <code>[[wait (system call)|wait]]</code>, <code>[[exec (system call)|exec]]</code>, <code>[[fork (system call)|fork]]</code>, <code>[[exit (system call)|exit]]</code>, and <code>[[kill (system call)|kill]]</code>. Many modern operating systems have hundreds of system calls. For example, [[Linux kernel|Linux]] and [[OpenBSD]] each have over 300 different calls,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/syscalls.2.html|title=syscalls(2) - Linux manual page}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://bxr.su/OpenBSD/sys/kern/syscalls.c|website=BSD Cross Reference|author=OpenBSD|title=System call names (kern/syscalls.c)|date=2013-09-14}}</ref> [[NetBSD]] has close to 500,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://bxr.su/NetBSD/sys/kern/syscalls.c|website=BSD Cross Reference|author=NetBSD|title=System call names (kern/syscalls.c)|date=2013-10-17}}</ref> [[FreeBSD]] has over 500,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://fxr.watson.org/fxr/source/kern/syscalls.c|title=FreeBSD syscalls.c, the list of syscall names and IDs}}</ref> Windows&nbsp;7 has close to 700,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://j00ru.vexillium.org/syscalls/win32k/32/|title=Windows WIN32K.SYS System Call Table (NT/2000/XP/2003/Vista/2008/7/8/10) |author=Author: Mateusz \"j00ru\" Jurczyk | date=2017-11-05}}</ref> while [[Plan 9 from Bell Labs|Plan 9]] has 51.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://9p.io/sources/plan9/sys/src/libc/9syscall/sys.h|title=Plan 9 sys.h, the list of syscall names and IDs}}</ref>\n\nTools such as [[strace]], [[ftrace]] and [[Truss (Unix)|truss]] allow a process to execute from start and report all system calls the process invokes, or can attach to an already running process and intercept any system call made by said process if the operation does not violate the permissions of the user. This special ability of the program is usually also implemented with a system call, e.g. strace is implemented with [[ptrace]] or system calls on files in [[procfs]].\n\n== Typical implementations ==\nImplementing system calls requires a transfer of control from user space to kernel space, which involves some sort of architecture-specific feature. A typical way to implement this is to use a [[software interrupt]] or [[Trap (computing)|trap]]. Interrupts transfer control to the operating system [[Kernel (computing)|kernel]], so software simply needs to set up some register with the system call number needed, and execute the software interrupt.\n\nThis is the only technique provided for many [[RISC]] processors, but [[Complex instruction set computer|CISC]] architectures such as [[x86]] support additional techniques. For example, the x86 [[instruction set]] contains the instructions SYSCALL/SYSRET and SYSENTER/SYSEXIT (these two mechanisms were independently created by AMD and Intel, respectively, but in essence they do the same thing). These are \"fast\" control transfer instructions that are designed to quickly transfer control to the kernel for a system call without the overhead of an interrupt.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://wiki.osdev.org/SYSENTER|title=SYSENTER (OSDev wiki)}}</ref> [[Linux]] 2.5 began using this on the [[x86]], where available; formerly it used the INT instruction, where the system call number was placed in the EAX [[Processor register|register]] before [[INT (x86 instruction)|interrupt]] 0x80 was executed.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://kerneltrap.org/node/531 |title=Linux 2.5 gets vsyscalls, sysenter support |accessdate=2008-01-01 |author=Anonymous |date=2002-12-19 |work=[[KernelTrap]]}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://articles.manugarg.com/systemcallinlinux2_6.html|title=Sysenter Based System Call Mechanism in Linux 2.6|date=2006|author=Manu Garg}}</ref>\n\nAn older mechanism is the call gate; originally used in [[Multics]] and later (see [[Call gate (Intel)]]) on the Intel [[x86]]. It allows a program to call a kernel function directly using a safe control transfer mechanism, which the operating system sets up in advance. This approach has been unpopular on x86, presumably due to the requirement of a far call (a call to a procedure located in a different segment than the current code segment<ref>{{cite web|url=http://x86.renejeschke.de/html/file_module_x86_id_26.html|title=Liberation: x86 Instruction Set Reference|work=renejeschke.de|accessdate=4 July 2015}}</ref>) which uses [[x86 memory segmentation]] and the resulting lack of [[Portability (software)|portability]] it causes, and existence of the faster instructions mentioned above.\n\nFor [[IA-64]] architecture, EPC (Enter Privileged Code) instruction is used. The first eight system call arguments are passed in registers, and the rest are passed on the stack.\n\nIn the [[IBM System/360]] mainframe family, and its successors, a [[Supervisor Call instruction]], with the number in the instruction rather than in a register, implements a system call for legacy facilities in most of{{efn|The CP component of CP-67 and VM uses the Diagnose (DIAG) instruction as a Hypervisor CALL (HVC) from a virtual machine to CP.}} IBM's own operating systems, and for all system calls in Linux.  In IBM's own operating systems, the Program Call (PC) instruction is used for newer facilities. In particular, PC is used when the caller might be in [[Service Request Block|SRB]] mode.\n\n==Categories of system calls==\nSystem calls can be grouped roughly into six major categories:<ref>{{Cite book|title=Operating System Concepts|last=Silberschatz|first=Abraham|publisher=Wiley|others=Peter B Galvin; Greg Gagne|year=2018|isbn=9781119320913|edition=10th|location=Hoboken, NJ|pages=67|oclc=1004849022}}</ref>\n\n:\n\n# Process control\n#* create process (for example, <code>[[fork (operating system)|fork]]</code> on Unix-like systems, or <code>NtCreateProcess</code> in the [[Windows NT]] [[Native API]])\n#*[[Kill (command)|terminate process]]\n#*[[Loader (computing)|load]], [[Exec (operating system)|execute]]\n#* get/set process attributes\n#*[[Wait (operating system)|wait]] for time, wait event, [[Signal (computing)|signal]] event\n#*[[Dynamic memory allocation|allocate]] and [[Garbage collection (computer science)|free]] memory\n# File management\n#* create file, delete file\n#* open, close\n#* read, write, reposition\n#* get/set file attributes\n# Device management\n#* request device, release device\n#* read, write, reposition\n#* get/set device attributes\n#* logically attach or detach devices\n# Information maintenance\n#* get/set time or date\n#* get/set system data\n#* get/set process, file, or device attributes\n# Communication\n#* create, delete communication connection\n#* send, receive messages\n#* transfer status information\n#* attach or detach remote devices\n#Protection\n#*get/set file permissions\n\n== Processor mode and context switching ==\nSystem calls in most [[Unix-like]] systems are processed in kernel mode, which is accomplished by changing the processor execution mode to a more privileged one, but no ''process'' [[context switch]] is necessary{{snd}} although a ''privilege'' context switch does occur. The hardware sees the world in terms of the execution mode according to the processor status register, and processes are an abstraction provided by the operating system. A system call does not generally require a context switch to another process; instead, it is processed in the context of whichever process invoked it.<ref name=\"Bach1986pp15-16\">Bach, Maurice J.

The handling of such calls is dependent on the design of the specific [[operating system]] kernel and the application runtime environment. The following list shows typical models followed by operating systems:<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.cs.uic.edu/~jbell/CourseNotes/OperatingSystems/4_Threads.html |title=Threads}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://kevinmarquet.net/wp-content/uploads/threading.pdf |title=Threading Models}}</ref>\n\n* ''Many-to-one'' model: All system calls from any user thread in a process are handled by a single kernel-level thread. This model has a serious drawback{{snd}} any blocking system call (like awaiting input from user) can freeze all the other threads. Also, since only one thread can access the kernel at a time, this model cannot utilize multiple cores of processor.\n* ''One-to-one'' model: Every user thread gets attached to a distinct kernel-level thread during a system call. This model solves the above problem of blocking system calls. It is found in all major [[Linux distribution]]s, [[macOS]], [[iOS]], recent [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]] and [[Solaris (operating system)|Solaris]] versions.\n* ''Many-to-many'' model: In this model a pool of user threads is mapped to a pool of kernel threads.

This may include hardware-related services (for example, accessing a [[hard disk drive]]), creation and execution of new [[process (computing)|processes]], and communication with integral [[kernel service]]s such as [[process scheduling]].  System calls provide an essential interface between a process and the operating system.\n\nIn most systems, system calls can only be made from [[userspace]] processes, while in some systems, [[OS/360 and successors]] for example, privileged system code also issues system calls.<ref>{{cite manual\n |     author = IBM\n |      title = IBM System/360 Operating System System Programmer's Guide\n |    section = Writing SVC Routines\n | sectionurl =\n |    version = Third Edition\n |  publisher =\n |       date = March 1967\n |        url = http://bitsavers.org/pdf/ibm/360/os/R01-08/C28-6550-2_OSsysPrmg_Mar67.pdf\n |     format = PDF\n |         id = C28-6550-2\n | accessdate =\n |      quote =\n |       page =\n |      pages = 32\u201336\n |        ref =\n }}</ref>\n\n== Privileges ==\nThe [[Instruction set|architecture]] of most modern processors, with the exception of some embedded systems, involves a [[CPU modes|security model]]. For example, the ''[[ring (computer security)|rings]]'' model specifies multiple privilege levels under which software may be executed: a program is usually limited to its own [[address space]] so that it cannot access or modify other running programs or the operating system itself, and is usually prevented from directly manipulating hardware devices (e.g. the [[frame buffer]] or [[Computer network|network]] devices).\n\nHowever, many applications need access to these components, so system calls are made available by the operating system to provide well-defined, safe implementations for such operations. The operating system executes at the highest level of privilege, and allows applications to request services via system calls, which are often initiated via [[interrupt]]s. An interrupt automatically puts the CPU into some elevated privilege level, and then passes control to the kernel, which determines whether the calling program should be granted the requested service. If the service is granted, the kernel executes a specific set of instructions over which the calling program has no direct control, returns the privilege level to that of the calling program, and then returns control to the calling program.\n\n== The library as an intermediary ==\nGenerally, systems provide a [[Library (computing)|library]] or [[API]] that sits between normal programs and the operating system.  On [[Unix-like]] systems, that API is usually part of an implementation of the [[C standard library|C library]] (libc), such as [[glibc]], that provides [[wrapper function]]s for the system calls, often named the same as the system calls they invoke. On [[Windows NT]], that API is part of the [[Native API]], in the <tt>ntdll.dll</tt> library; this is an undocumented API used by implementations of the regular [[Windows API]] and directly used by some system programs on Windows.  The library's wrapper functions expose an ordinary function [[calling convention]] (a [[subroutine]] call on the [[assembly language|assembly]] level) for using the system call, as well as making the system call more [[modularity|modular]]. Here, the primary function of the wrapper is to place all the arguments to be passed to the system call in the appropriate [[processor register]]s (and maybe on the [[call stack]] as well), and also setting a unique system call number for the kernel to call. In this way the library, which exists between the OS and the application, increases [[Software portability|portability]].\n\nThe call to the library function itself does not cause a switch to [[kernel mode]] and is usually a normal [[subroutine call]] (using, for example, a \"CALL\" assembly instruction in some [[Instruction set architecture]]s (ISAs)). The actual system call does transfer control to the kernel (and is more implementation-dependent and platform-dependent than the library call abstracting it). For example, in [[Unix-like]] systems, <code>fork</code> and <code>execve</code> are C library functions that in turn execute instructions that invoke the <code>fork</code> and <code>exec</code> system calls. Making the system call directly in the [[application code]] is more complicated and may require embedded assembly code to be used (in [[C (programming language)|C]] and [[C++]]) as well as knowledge of the low-level binary interface for the system call operation, which may be subject to change over time and thus not be part of the [[application binary interface]]; the library functions are meant to abstract this away.\n\nOn [[exokernel]] based systems, the library is especially important as an intermediary. On exokernels, libraries shield user applications from the very low level kernel [[Application programming interface|API]], and provide [[Abstraction (computer science)|abstractions]] and [[Resource (computer science)|resource]] management.\n\nIBM operating systems descended from [[OS/360 and successors|OS/360]] and [[DOS/360 and successors|DOS/360]], including [[z/OS]] and [[VSE (operating system)|z/VSE]], implement system calls through a library of assembly language [[Macro (computer science)|macros]].  This reflects their origin at a time when programming in assembly language was more common than [[High-level programming language|high-level language]] usage.  IBM system calls are therefore not directly executable by high-level language programs, but require a callable assembly language wrapper subroutine.\n\n== Examples and tools ==\nOn [[Unix]], [[Unix-like]] and other [[POSIX]]-compliant operating systems, popular system calls are <code>[[open (system call)|open]]</code>, <code>[[read (system call)|read]]</code>, <code>[[write (system call)|write]]</code>, <code>[[close (system call)|close]]</code>, <code>[[wait (system call)|wait]]</code>, <code>[[Exec (operating system)|exec]]</code>, <code>[[fork (system call)|fork]]</code>, <code>[[exit (system call)|exit]]</code>, and <code>[[kill (command)|kill]]</code>. Many modern operating systems have hundreds of system calls. For example, [[Linux kernel|Linux]] and [[OpenBSD]] each have over 300 different calls,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/syscalls.2.html|title=syscalls(2) - Linux manual page}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://bxr.su/OpenBSD/sys/kern/syscalls.c|website=BSD Cross Reference|author=OpenBSD|title=System call names (kern/syscalls.c)|date=2013-09-14}}</ref> [[NetBSD]] has close to 500,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://bxr.su/NetBSD/sys/kern/syscalls.c|website=BSD Cross Reference|author=NetBSD|title=System call names (kern/syscalls.c)|date=2013-10-17}}</ref> [[FreeBSD]] has over 500,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://fxr.watson.org/fxr/source/kern/syscalls.c|title=FreeBSD syscalls.c, the list of syscall names and IDs}}</ref> Windows&nbsp;7 has close to 700,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://j00ru.vexillium.org/syscalls/win32k/32/|title=Windows WIN32K.SYS System Call Table (NT/2000/XP/2003/Vista/2008/7/8/10) |author=Author: Mateusz \"j00ru\" Jurczyk | date=2017-11-05}}</ref> while [[Plan 9 from Bell Labs|Plan 9]] has 51.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://9p.io/sources/plan9/sys/src/libc/9syscall/sys.h|title=Plan 9 sys.h, the list of syscall names and IDs}}</ref>\n\nTools such as [[strace]], [[ftrace]] and [[Truss (Unix)|truss]] allow a process to execute from start and report all system calls the process invokes, or can attach to an already running process and intercept any system call made by said process if the operation does not violate the permissions of the user. This special ability of the program is usually also implemented with a system call, e.g. strace is implemented with [[ptrace]] or system calls on files in [[procfs]].\n\n== Typical implementations ==\nImplementing system calls requires a transfer of control from user space to kernel space, which involves some sort of architecture-specific feature. A typical way to implement this is to use a [[software interrupt]] or [[Trap (computing)|trap]]. Interrupts transfer control to the operating system [[Kernel (computing)|kernel]], so software simply needs to set up some register with the system call number needed, and execute the software interrupt.\n\nThis is the only technique provided for many [[RISC]] processors, but [[Complex instruction set computer|CISC]] architectures such as [[x86]] support additional techniques. For example, the x86 [[instruction set]] contains the instructions SYSCALL/SYSRET and SYSENTER/SYSEXIT (these two mechanisms were independently created by AMD and Intel, respectively, but in essence they do the same thing). These are \"fast\" control transfer instructions that are designed to quickly transfer control to the kernel for a system call without the overhead of an interrupt.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://wiki.osdev.org/SYSENTER|title=SYSENTER (OSDev wiki)}}</ref> [[Linux]] 2.5 began using this on the [[x86]], where available; formerly it used the INT instruction, where the system call number was placed in the EAX [[Processor register|register]] before [[INT (x86 instruction)|interrupt]] 0x80 was executed.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://kerneltrap.org/node/531 |title=Linux 2.5 gets vsyscalls, sysenter support |accessdate=2008-01-01 |author=Anonymous |date=2002-12-19 |work=[[KernelTrap]]}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://articles.manugarg.com/systemcallinlinux2_6.html|title=Sysenter Based System Call Mechanism in Linux 2.6|date=2006|author=Manu Garg}}</ref>\n\nAn older mechanism is the call gate; originally used in [[Multics]] and later (see [[Call gate (Intel)]]) on the Intel [[x86]]. It allows a program to call a kernel function directly using a safe control transfer mechanism, which the operating system sets up in advance. This approach has been unpopular on x86, presumably due to the requirement of a far call (a call to a procedure located in a different segment than the current code segment<ref>{{cite web|url=http://x86.renejeschke.de/html/file_module_x86_id_26.html|title=Liberation: x86 Instruction Set Reference|work=renejeschke.de|accessdate=4 July 2015}}</ref>) which uses [[x86 memory segmentation]] and the resulting lack of [[Portability (software)|portability]] it causes, and existence of the faster instructions mentioned above.\n\nFor [[IA-64]] architecture, EPC (Enter Privileged Code) instruction is used. The first eight system call arguments are passed in registers, and the rest are passed on the stack.\n\nIn the [[IBM System/360]] mainframe family, and its successors, a [[Supervisor Call instruction]], with the number in the instruction rather than in a register, implements a system call for legacy facilities in most of{{efn|The CP component of CP-67 and VM uses the Diagnose (DIAG) instruction as a Hypervisor CALL (HVC) from a virtual machine to CP.}} IBM's own operating systems, and for all system calls in Linux.  In IBM's own operating systems, the Program Call (PC) instruction is used for newer facilities. In particular, PC is used when the caller might be in [[Service Request Block|SRB]] mode.\n\n==Categories of system calls==\nSystem calls can be grouped roughly into six major categories:<ref>{{Cite book|title=Operating System Concepts|last=Silberschatz|first=Abraham|publisher=Wiley|others=Peter B Galvin; Greg Gagne|year=2018|isbn=9781119320913|edition=10th|location=Hoboken, NJ|pages=67|oclc=1004849022}}</ref>\n\n:\n\n# Process control\n#* create process (for example, <code>[[fork (operating system)|fork]]</code> on Unix-like systems, or <code>NtCreateProcess</code> in the [[Windows NT]] [[Native API]])\n#*[[Kill (command)|terminate process]]\n#*[[Loader (computing)|load]], [[Exec (operating system)|execute]]\n#* get/set process attributes\n#*[[Wait (operating system)|wait]] for time, wait event, [[Signal (computing)|signal]] event\n#*[[Dynamic memory allocation|allocate]] and [[Garbage collection (computer science)|free]] memory\n# File management\n#* create file, delete file\n#* open, close\n#* read, write, reposition\n#* get/set file attributes\n# Device management\n#* request device, release device\n#* read, write, reposition\n#* get/set device attributes\n#* logically attach or detach devices\n# Information maintenance\n#* get/set time or date\n#* get/set system data\n#* get/set process, file, or device attributes\n# Communication\n#* create, delete communication connection\n#* send, receive messages\n#* transfer status information\n#* attach or detach remote devices\n#Protection\n#*get/set file permissions\n\n== Processor mode and context switching ==\nSystem calls in most [[Unix-like]] systems are processed in kernel mode, which is accomplished by changing the processor execution mode to a more privileged one, but no ''process'' [[context switch]] is necessary{{snd}} although a ''privilege'' context switch does occur. The hardware sees the world in terms of the execution mode according to the processor status register, and processes are an abstraction provided by the operating system. A system call does not generally require a context switch to another process; instead, it is processed in the context of whichever process invoked it.<ref name=\"Bach1986pp15-16\">Bach, Maurice J.

This model has a serious drawback{{snd}} any blocking system call (like awaiting input from user) can freeze all the other threads. Also, since only one thread can access the kernel at a time, this model cannot utilize multiple cores of processor.\n* ''One-to-one'' model: Every user thread gets attached to a distinct kernel-level thread during a system call. This model solves the above problem of blocking system calls. It is found in all major [[Linux distribution]]s, [[macOS]], [[iOS]], recent [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]] and [[Solaris (operating system)|Solaris]] versions.\n* ''Many-to-many'' model: In this model a pool of user threads is mapped to a pool of kernel threads.
