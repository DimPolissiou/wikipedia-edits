It took place on May 21, 2000, at [[Freedom Hall]] in [[Louisville, Kentucky]]. The previous [[Judgment Day: In Your House|Judgment Day]] edition was an [[In Your House]] event held in October 1998. As a result of [[Owen Hart]]'s death at [[Over the Edge (1999)|Over the Edge]] in May 1999, Judgment Day was brought back in 2000 and was rebranded as an annual WWF pay-per-view event.\n\nThe [[Card (sports)#Main event|main event]] was an [[Iron Man match]] for the [[WWE Championship|WWF Championship]] and featured [[Triple H]] facing [[Dwayne Johnson|The Rock]] with WWF Commissioner [[Shawn Michaels]] as the [[Professional wrestling match types#Special referee|special guest referee]]. Triple H defeated The Rock to win the championship by 6 [[Pin (professional wrestling)|falls]] to 5, after a [[Professional wrestling#Disqualification|disqualification]] in the final seconds by Shawn Michaels as a result of interference by the returning [[The Undertaker|Undertaker]]. Featured matches on the [[Card (sports)#Undercard|undercard]] included a [[Professional wrestling match types#Tables match|double tables match]] featuring [[D-Generation X]] ([[Brian Gerald James|Road Dogg]] and [[Sean Waltman|X-Pac]]) defeating [[Dudley Boyz|The Dudley Boyz]] ([[Mark LoMonaco|Bubba Ray Dudley]] and [[Devon Hughes|D-Von Dudley]]). The other featured match on the undercard was a [[Professional wrestling match types|Submission match]] for the [[WWE Intercontinental Championship|WWF Intercontinental Championship]] between [[Chris Benoit]] and [[Chris Jericho]], which Benoit won to retain the championship.\n\n==Storylines==\nThe main event of the evening was a 60-minute Iron man match between former World Wrestling Federation Champion Triple H and the current title holder at the time, The Rock. At WrestleMania, Vince McMahon turned on The Rock and helped Triple H retain his title, joining his daughter Stephanie and son Shane in the [[McMahon-Helmsley Faction]] with Triple H and [[D-Generation X]]. In the weeks leading up to Backlash The Rock and Triple H's hostility had reached its climax it seemed. At Backlash, with the help of Stone Cold Steve Austin, The Rock defeated Triple H. The next night on Raw Triple H stated that he wanted to take The Rock on in a 60-minute Iron man match for the World Wrestling Federation title, Shawn Michaels also got involved, requesting to be special guest referee.\n\nIn the meantime, Shane McMahon began a rivalry with the Big Show. Leading into WrestleMania Shane had actually aligned himself with Big Show, who at the time was feuding with The Rock over the finish to January's Royal Rumble. Shane interfered in their match at [[No Way Out (2000)|No Way Out]] in February and helped Big Show win, which earned Show the #1 contendership and a match with Triple H, who had won back the WWF Championship Big Show had taken from him at [[Survivor Series (1999)|Survivor Series]] in November 1999, at WrestleMania. The match eventually grew to include The Rock and Mick Foley, and Big Show was the first wrestler eliminated from the ensuing elimination fatal-four-way main event. After WrestleMania, with Shane now siding with the defending champion, Big Show began a brief period where he would imitate other wrestlers in a comedic role. This earned him ridicule from Shane, so the two began a rivalry that led to a match at Judgment Day.\n\nAnother feud involving the Faction was DX's feud with the [[Dudley Boyz]], which had started when they had defeated the [[New Age Outlaws]] at No Way Out for the [[World Tag Team Championship (WWE)|WWF Tag Team Championship]] and caused the breakup of the Outlaws. Although the Dudleys did help out the Faction at times, they eventually turned on them and became heroes in the eyes of the fans. At the time Bubba Ray Dudley had taken to powerbombing many of the WWF's female wrestlers through tables and was keen on doing so to Tori, who was [[Sean Waltman|X-Pac]]'s storyline girlfriend. This led to a tables match being set for Judgment Day.\n\nThe ongoing rivalry between [[Chris Benoit]] and [[Chris Jericho]] over the [[WWE Intercontinental Championship|WWF Intercontinental Championship]] began at [[WrestleMania 2000|WresleMania 2000]] where Benoit and Jericho along with [[Kurt Angle]] faced each other in a two fall triple threat match for both Angle's Intercontinental Championship and [[WWE European Championship|European Championship]]. Benoit won the Intercontinental Championship after pinning Jericho while Jericho won the European Championship after pinning Benoit. Jericho lost the European Championship to [[Eddie Guerrero]] the following night on Raw is War after [[Chyna]] turned on Jericho for Guerrero. Benoit defended the Intercontinental Championship against Jericho at [[Backlash (2000)|Backlash]] where Benoit won by disqualification after Jericho used the title belt to defend himself from Benoit's Diving headbutt and was disqualified as a result. Benoit and Jericho had a rematch for the title on the May 4 episode of Smackdown! where Jericho won after hitting Benoit with the title belt then hitting him with the Lionsault while referee [[Earl Hebner]] was thrown out of the ring by Benoit. After aiding The Rock, confronting and insulting the McMahon-Helmsley Faction, Jericho was forced to defend the Intercontinental Championship on the May 8 episode of Raw is War. After retaining the title against Kurt Angle and Big Show, Jericho lost the Intercontinental Championship back to Benoit after special guest referee Triple H purposely got distracted by his wife [[Stephanie McMahon|Stephanie McMahon-Helmsley]] while Benoit tapped out to the Walls of Jericho and after Jericho hit him to get his attention Triple H hit Jericho from behind causing Jericho to be locked in Benoit's Crippler Crossface before Triple H called for the bell and awarded the title to Benoit despite Jericho [[Montreal Screwjob|not submitting]]. Benoit later announced that he would give Jericho a rematch for the Intercontinental Championship at Judgment Day in a [[submission match]].\n\n==Event==\n{| class=wikitable style=\"font-size:90%; margin: 0.5em 0 0.5em 1em; float: right; clear: right;\"\n|+ '''Other on-screen personnel'''\n!|Role:\n!|Name:\n|-\n|rowspan=2|English [[Sports commentators|commentators]]\n|[[Jerry Lawler]]\n|-\n|[[Jim Ross]]\n|-\n|rowspan=2|Spanish commentators\n|[[Carlos Cabrera]]\n|-\n|[[Hugo Savinovich]]\n|-\n|rowspan=2|[[Interviewer]]s\n|[[Michael Cole (wrestling)|Michael Cole]]\n|-\n|[[Jonathan Coachman]]\n|-\n|[[Ring announcer]]\n|[[Howard Finkel]]\n|-\n|rowspan=7|[[Referee (professional wrestling)|Referees]]\n|[[Mike Chioda]]\n|-\n|[[Earl Hebner]]\n|-\n|[[Jim Korderas]]\n|-\n|[[Tim White (referee)|Tim White]]\n|-\n|[[Theodore Long]]\n|-\n|Chad Patton\n|-\n|[[Jack Doan]]\n|}\n\n===Preliminary matches===\nThe event opened with [[Team ECK]] ([[Kurt Angle]], [[Edge (wrestler)|Edge]], and [[Christian (wrestler)|Christian]]) facing [[Too Cool]] ([[Scotty 2 Hotty]], [[Brian Christopher|Grand Master Sexay]], and [[Rikishi (wrestler)|Rikishi]]). Grand Master Sexay performed the Hip Hop Drop on Edge to win the match.\n\nNext, [[Eddie Guerrero]] defended the [[WWE European Championship|WWF European Championship]] against [[Perry Saturn]] and [[Dean Malenko]] in a Triple Threat match. After [[Chyna]] hit Saturn with a bouquet of roses, Guererro pinned Malenko with an Oklahoma Roll to retain the title.\n\nAfter that, [[Shane McMahon]] faced [[Big Show]] in a Falls Count Anywhere match. After interference from [[Big Boss Man (wrestler)|Big Boss Man]], [[Test (wrestler)|Test]], [[Matt Bloom|Albert]], [[Trish Stratus]] and [[Bull Buchanan]], Shane hit Big Show with a cinderblock to win the match.\n\nLater, [[Chris Benoit]] defended the [[WWE Intercontinental Championship|WWF Intercontinental Championship]] against [[Chris Jericho]] in a Submission match. Jericho passed out to the Crippler Crossface by Benoit, meaning Benoit won the match and retained the title.\n\nIn the fifth match, [[D-Generation X]] ([[Road Dogg]] and [[Sean Waltman|X-Pac]]) faced [[The Dudley Boyz]] ([[Mark LoMonaco|Bubba Ray Dudley]] and [[Devon Hughes|D-Von Dudley]]) in a Tag Team Tables match. X-Pac performed a Super X-Factor through a table on Bubba to win the match.\n\n===Main event===\nIn the main event, [[Dwayne Johnson|The Rock]] defended the [[WWE Championship|WWF Championship]] against [[Triple H]] in a 60-minute Iron Man match with WWF Commissioner Shawn Michaels as the special guest referee. Rock performed a Rock bottom on Triple H to make the score 1-0. Triple H performed a Pedigree on Rock to make the score 1-1. Triple H pinned Rock with a Small Package to make the score 2-1. Triple H performed a Piledriver on Rock to make the score 3-1. Rock performed a DDT on Triple H to make the score 3-2. Triple H was disqualified for attacking Rock with a steel chair, making the score 3-3. Triple H pinned Rock using the ropes for leverage to make the score 4-3. Rock passed out to a Sleeper Hold by Triple H, making the score 5-3. Triple H was counted out after Rock performed a Pedigree on an announce table on Triple H, making the score 5-4. Rock performed a People's Elbow on Triple H to make the score 5-5. After Road Dogg and X-Pac interfered, [[The Undertaker]] returned and attacked Road Dogg, X-Pac, [[Shane McMahon]] and [[Vince McMahon]]. Undertaker attacked Triple H with a Chokeslam and a Tombstone Piledriver as the time limit expired. Rock was disqualified for Undertaker's interference, meaning Triple H won the match 6-5 and the title.\n\n==Aftermath==\nThe Rock continued his feud with Triple H, who now had to also contend with The Undertaker and, by association, [[Kane (wrestler)|Kane]]. This led to a six-man tag team match at [[King of the Ring (2000)|King of the Ring]] the next month featuring The Rock, The Undertaker, and Kane against Triple H, Vince McMahon, and Shane McMahon where if any member of Triple H's team was pinned, whoever scored the fall would win the WWF Championship. The Rock won the match for his team by pinning Vince McMahon.\n\nDX and the Dudley Boyz continued their feud at King of the Ring as well, with a Table/Dumpster match with the same teams. DX won the match, but Bubba Ray got his revenge on Tori by putting her through a table.\n\nLess than a week before King of the Ring, Chris Benoit would lose the Intercontinental Championship to Rikishi. Edge and Christian would lose the WWF Tag Team Championship to Too Cool. [[Crash Holly]] would regain the Hardcore Championship from [[Gerald Brisco]], but would lose it back to him right before King of the Ring. Brisco would lose the title to [[Pat Patterson (wrestler)|Pat Patterson]], starting a brief feud between the two.\n{{Clear}}\n\n==Results==\n{{Pro Wrestling results table\n|match1 = [[Too Cool]] ([[Grand Master Sexay]], [[Rikishi (wrestler)|Rikishi]] and [[Scotty 2 Hotty]]) defeated [[Team ECK]] ([[Edge (wrestler)|Edge]], [[Christian Cage|Christian]] and [[Kurt Angle]])\n|stip1  = [[Six-man tag team match]]\n|time1 = 09:46\n|match2 = [[Eddie Guerrero]] (c) (with [[Chyna]]) defeated [[Dean Malenko]] and [[Perry Saturn]] \n|stip2  = [[Triple threat match]] for the [[WWF European Championship]]\n|time2 = 07:57\n|match3 = [[Shane McMahon]] defeated [[Big Show]]\n|stip3  = [[Falls Count Anywhere match]]\n|time3 = 07:12\n|match4 = [[Chris Benoit]] (c) defeated [[Chris Jericho]]\n|stip4 = [[Submission match]] for the [[WWF Intercontinental Championship]]\n|time4 = 13:27\n|match5 = [[D-Generation X]] ([[Road Dogg]] and [[X-Pac]]) (with [[Tori (wrestler)|Tori]]) defeated [[The Dudley Boyz]] ([[Bubba Ray Dudley]] and [[D-Von Dudley]])\n|stip5 = [[Tag team match|Tag team]] [[Professional wrestling match types#Tables match|tables match]]\n|time5 = 10:55\n|match6 = [[Triple H]] (with [[Shane McMahon]], [[Stephanie McMahon-Helmsley]] and [[Mr. McMahon]]) defeated [[Dwayne Johnson|The Rock]] (c) 6\u20135\n|stip6  = 60-minute [[iron man match]] for the [[WWF Championship]] with [[Shawn Michaels]] as the [[Professional wrestling match types#Special referee|special guest referee]]\n|time6 = 1:00:00\n}}\n\n===Iron man match===\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!'''Score'''\n!'''Point Winner'''\n!'''Decision'''\n!'''Notes'''\n!'''Time'''\n|-\n|0\u20131\n|The Rock\n|Pinfall\n|Pinfall after a Rock Bottom.\n\n|10:42\n|-\n|1\u20131\n|Triple H\n|Pinfall\n|Pinfall after a Pedigree\n|25:28\n|-\n|2\u20131\n|Triple H\n|Pinfall\n|Pinfall with an inside cradle\n|26:27\n|-\n|3\u20131\n|Triple H\n|Pinfall\n|Pinfall after a Piledriver\n|32:23\n|-\n|3\u20132\n|The Rock\n|Pinfall\n|Pinfall after a DDT\n|40:35\n|-\n|3\u20133\n|The Rock\n|Disqualification\n|Triple H was disqualified for attacking The Rock with a steel chair\n|43:43\n|-\n|4\u20133\n|Triple H\n|Pinfall\n|Pinfall using the ropes for leverage\n|44:08\n|-\n|5\u20133\n|Triple H\n|Submission\n|The Rock passed out in a Sleeper hold by Triple H\n|47:28\n|-\n|5\u20134\n|The Rock\n|Count out\n|Triple H was counted out after a Pedigree on a broadcast table by The Rock\n|56:09\n|-\n|5\u20135\n|The Rock\n|Pinfall\n|Pinfall after a People's Elbow\n|58:03\n|-\n|6\u20135\n|Triple H\n|Disqualification\n|The Rock was disqualified after The Undertaker attacked Triple H with a Tombstone Piledriver with 1 second on the clock\n|59:59\n|}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20080331122411/http://www.wwe.com/shows/judgmentday/history/judgmentday2000/ Official website]\n*[http://www.wwe.com WWE.com]\n\n{{2000 WWF pay-per-view events}}\n{{WWEPPV|Judgment Day}}\n\n[[Category:WWE Judgment Day|2000]]\n[[Category:Events in Louisville, Kentucky]]\n[[Category:2000 in Kentucky]]\n[[Category:Professional wrestling in Kentucky]]\n[[Category:2000 WWF pay-per-view events]]\n[[Category:May 2000 events in the United States]]\n", "text_old": "{{short description|2000 World Wrestling Federation pay-per-view event}}\n{{Infobox Wrestling event\n|name       = Judgment Day (2000)\n|image      = 2000JudgmentDay.jpg\n|caption    = Promotional poster featuring [[Kane (wrestler)|Kane]] \n|promotion  = [[WWE|World Wrestling Federation]]\n|date       = May 21, 2000\n|venue      = [[Freedom Hall]]\n|city       = [[Louisville, Kentucky]]\n|attendance = 16,827\n|buyrate    = 420,000<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.wrestlingdata.com/index.php?befehl=shows&show=8350|title=WWF Judgment Day 2000|work=Wrestlingdata|accessdate=April 9, 2020}}</ref>\n|lastevent  = [[Insurrextion (2000)|Insurrextion]]\n|nextevent  = [[King of the Ring (2000)|King of the Ring]]\n|event      = [[WWE Judgment Day|Judgment Day]]\n|lastevent2 = [[Judgment Day: In Your House|In Your House]]\n|nextevent2 = [[Judgment Day (2001)|2001]]\n}}\n'''Judgment Day (2000)''' was the first annual [[WWE Judgment Day|Judgment Day]] [[professional wrestling]] [[pay-per-view]] (PPV) [[List of WWE pay-per-view events|event]] produced by the [[WWE|World Wrestling Federation]] (WWF).

After retaining the title against Kurt Angle and Big Show, Jericho lost the Intercontinental Championship back to Benoit after special guest referee Triple H purposely got distracted by his wife [[Stephanie McMahon|Stephanie McMahon-Helmsley]] while Benoit tapped out to the Walls of Jericho and after Jericho hit him to get his attention Triple H hit Jericho from behind causing Jericho to be locked in Benoit's Crippler Crossface before Triple H called for the bell and awarded the title to Benoit despite Jericho [[Montreal Screwjob|not submitting]]. Benoit later announced that he would give Jericho a rematch for the Intercontinental Championship at Judgment Day in a [[submission match]].\n\n==Event==\n{| class=wikitable style=\"font-size:90%; margin: 0.5em 0 0.5em 1em; float: right; clear: right;\"\n|+ '''Other on-screen personnel'''\n!|Role:\n!|Name:\n|-\n|rowspan=2|English [[Sports commentators|commentators]]\n|[[Jerry Lawler]]\n|-\n|[[Jim Ross]]\n|-\n|rowspan=2|Spanish commentators\n|[[Carlos Cabrera]]\n|-\n|[[Hugo Savinovich]]\n|-\n|rowspan=2|[[Interviewer]]s\n|[[Michael Cole (wrestling)|Michael Cole]]\n|-\n|[[Jonathan Coachman]]\n|-\n|[[Ring announcer]]\n|[[Howard Finkel]]\n|-\n|rowspan=7|[[Referee (professional wrestling)|Referees]]\n|[[Mike Chioda]]\n|-\n|[[Earl Hebner]]\n|-\n|[[Jim Korderas]]\n|-\n|[[Tim White (referee)|Tim White]]\n|-\n|[[Theodore Long]]\n|-\n|Chad Patton\n|-\n|[[Jack Doan]]\n|}\n\n===Preliminary matches===\nThe event opened with [[Team ECK]] ([[Kurt Angle]], [[Edge (wrestler)|Edge]], and [[Christian (wrestler)|Christian]]) facing [[Too Cool]] ([[Scotty 2 Hotty]], [[Brian Christopher|Grand Master Sexay]], and [[Rikishi (wrestler)|Rikishi]]). Grand Master Sexay performed the Hip Hop Drop on Edge to win the match.\n\nNext, [[Eddie Guerrero]] defended the [[WWE European Championship|WWF European Championship]] against [[Perry Saturn]] and [[Dean Malenko]] in a Triple Threat match. After [[Chyna]] hit Saturn with a bouquet of roses, Guererro pinned Malenko with an Oklahoma Roll to retain the title.\n\nAfter that, [[Shane McMahon]] faced [[Big Show]] in a Falls Count Anywhere match. After interference from [[Big Boss Man (wrestler)|Big Boss Man]], [[Test (wrestler)|Test]], [[Matt Bloom|Albert]], [[Trish Stratus]] and [[Bull Buchanan]], Shane hit Big Show with a cinderblock to win the match.\n\nLater, [[Chris Benoit]] defended the [[WWE Intercontinental Championship|WWF Intercontinental Championship]] against [[Chris Jericho]] in a Submission match. Jericho passed out to the Crippler Crossface by Benoit, meaning Benoit won the match and retained the title.\n\nIn the fifth match, [[D-Generation X]] ([[Road Dogg]] and [[Sean Waltman|X-Pac]]) faced [[The Dudley Boyz]] ([[Mark LoMonaco|Bubba Ray Dudley]] and [[Devon Hughes|D-Von Dudley]]) in a Tag Team Tables match. X-Pac performed a Super X-Factor through a table on Bubba to win the match.\n\n===Main event===\nIn the main event, [[Dwayne Johnson|The Rock]] defended the [[WWE Championship|WWF Championship]] against [[Triple H]] in a 60-minute Iron Man match with WWF Commissioner Shawn Michaels as the special guest referee. Rock performed a Rock bottom on Triple H to make the score 1-0. Triple H performed a Pedigree on Rock to make the score 1-1. Triple H pinned Rock with a Small Package to make the score 2-1. Triple H performed a Piledriver on Rock to make the score 3-1. Rock performed a DDT on Triple H to make the score 3-2. Triple H was disqualified for attacking Rock with a steel chair, making the score 3-3. Triple H pinned Rock using the ropes for leverage to make the score 4-3. Rock passed out to a Sleeper Hold by Triple H, making the score 5-3. Triple H was counted out after Rock performed a Pedigree on an announce table on Triple H, making the score 5-4. Rock performed a People's Elbow on Triple H to make the score 5-5. After Road Dogg and X-Pac interfered, [[The Undertaker]] returned and attacked Road Dogg, X-Pac, [[Shane McMahon]] and [[Vince McMahon]]. Undertaker attacked Triple H with a Chokeslam and a Tombstone Piledriver as the time limit expired. Rock was disqualified for Undertaker's interference, meaning Triple H won the match 6-5 and the title.\n\n==Aftermath==\nThe Rock continued his feud with Triple H, who now had to also contend with The Undertaker and, by association, [[Kane (wrestler)|Kane]]. This led to a six-man tag team match at [[King of the Ring (2000)|King of the Ring]] the next month featuring The Rock, The Undertaker, and Kane against Triple H, Vince McMahon, and Shane McMahon where if any member of Triple H's team was pinned, whoever scored the fall would win the WWF Championship. The Rock won the match for his team by pinning Vince McMahon.\n\nDX and the Dudley Boyz continued their feud at King of the Ring as well, with a Table/Dumpster match with the same teams. DX won the match, but Bubba Ray got his revenge on Tori by putting her through a table.\n\nLess than a week before King of the Ring, Chris Benoit would lose the Intercontinental Championship to Rikishi. Edge and Christian would lose the WWF Tag Team Championship to Too Cool. [[Crash Holly]] would regain the Hardcore Championship from [[Gerald Brisco]], but would lose it back to him right before King of the Ring.

It consisted of the ''[[German Army (1935\u20131945)|Heer]]'' (army), the ''[[Kriegsmarine]]'' (navy) and the ''[[Luftwaffe]]'' (air force). The designation \"''Wehrmacht''\" replaced the previously used term ''[[Reichswehr]]'', and was the manifestation of the Nazi regime's efforts to [[German re-armament|rearm Germany]] to a greater extent than the [[Treaty of Versailles]] permitted.{{sfn|Taylor|1995|pp=90\u2013119}}\n\nAfter the [[Adolf Hitler's rise to power|Nazi rise to power]] in 1933, one of [[Adolf Hitler]]'s most overt and audacious moves was to establish the ''Wehrmacht'', a modern offensively-capable armed force, fulfilling the Nazi regime's long-term goals of regaining lost territory as well as gaining new territory and dominating its neighbours. This required the reinstatement of conscription, and massive investment and [[defense spending]] on the [[arms industry]].{{sfn|Kitchen|1994|pp=39\u201365}}\n\nThe ''Wehrmacht'' formed the heart of Germany's politico-military power. In the early part of the [[World War II|Second World War]], the ''Wehrmacht'' employed combined arms tactics (close cover air-support, tanks, and infantry) to devastating effect in what became known as ''[[Blitzkrieg]]'' (lightning war). Its campaigns in [[Battle of France|France (1940)]], the [[Operation Barbarossa|Soviet Union (1941)]], and [[North African Campaign|North Africa (1941/42)]] are regarded as acts of boldness.{{sfn|Van Creveld|1982|p=3}} At the same time, the far-flung advances strained the ''Wehrmacht's'' capacity to the breaking point, culminating in the first major defeat in the [[Battle of Moscow]] (1941); by late 1942, Germany was losing the initiative in all theatres. The operational art was no match to the war-making abilities of the Allied coalition, making the ''Wehrmacht's'' weaknesses in strategy, doctrine, and logistics readily apparent.{{sfn|M\u00fcller|2016|pp=58\u201359}}\n\nClosely cooperating with the [[Schutzstaffel|''SS'']] and the ''[[Einsatzgruppen]]'', the German armed forces committed numerous [[Wehrmacht war crimes|war crimes]], despite later denials and promotion of the [[myth of the clean Wehrmacht|myth of the clean ''Wehrmacht'']].{{sfn|Hartmann|2013|pp=85\u2013108}} The majority of the war crimes were committed in the Soviet Union, Poland, Yugoslavia, Greece and Italy, as part of the [[war of annihilation]] against the Soviet Union, [[the Holocaust]] and [[Nazi security warfare]].\n\nDuring the war about 18 million men served in the ''Wehrmacht''.{{Sfnm|1a1=Overmans|1y=2004|1p=215|2a1=M\u00fcller|2y=2016|2p=16|3a1=Wette|3y=2006|3p=77}} By the time the war ended in Europe in May 1945, German forces (consisting of the [[German Army (1935\u20131945)|''Heer'']], the [[Kriegsmarine|''Kriegsmarine'']], the ''[[Luftwaffe]]'', the ''[[Waffen-SS]]'', the ''[[Volkssturm]]'', and [[Wehrmacht foreign volunteers and conscripts|foreign collaborateur units]]) had lost approximately 11,300,000 men,{{sfn|Fritz|2011| p=470}} about half of whom were missing or killed during the war. Only a few of the ''Wehrmacht''<nowiki/>'s upper leadership were tried for war crimes, despite evidence suggesting that more were involved in illegal actions.{{sfn|Wette|2006|pp=195\u2013250}}{{sfn|USHMM|n.d.}} According to [[Ian Kershaw]] most of the three million ''Wehrmacht'' soldiers who invaded the [[Operation Barbarossa|USSR]] participated in committing war crimes.{{Sfn|Kershaw|1997|p=150}}\n\n== Origin ==\n===Etymology===\nThe German term ''\"Wehrmacht''\" stems from the compound word of {{lang-de|wehren}}, \"to defend\" and {{lang|de|Macht}}, \"power, force\".{{efn|See [[wikt:Wehrmacht#German|the Wiktionary article]] for more information.}} It has been used to describe any nation's armed forces; for example, ''Britische Wehrmacht'' meaning \"British Armed Forces\". The [[Frankfurt Constitution]] of 1849 designated all German military forces as the \"German ''Wehrmacht''\", consisting of the ''Seemacht'' (sea force) and the ''Landmacht'' (land force).{{sfn|Huber|2000}} In 1919, the term ''Wehrmacht'' also appears in Article 47 of the [[Weimar Constitution]], establishing that: \"The Reich's President holds supreme command of all armed forces [i.e. the ''Wehrmacht''] of the Reich\". From 1919, Germany's national defense force was known as the ''[[Reichswehr]]'', a name that was dropped in favor of ''Wehrmacht'' on 21 May 1935.{{sfn|Strohn|2010|p=10}}\n\n=== Background ===\n[[File:Bundesarchiv_Bild_102-16108,_Vereidigung_von_Reichswehr-Soldaten_auf_Hitler.jpg|alt=|thumb|253x253px|''Reichswehr'' soldiers swearing the [[Hitler oath]] in August 1934]]\nIn January 1919, after [[World War I]] ended with the signing of the [[Armistice with Germany (Compi\u00e8gne)|armistice of 11 November 1918]], the armed forces were dubbed ''Friedensheer'' (peace army).{{sfn|Wheeler-Bennett|1967|p=60}} In March 1919, the national assembly passed a law founding a 420,000-strong preliminary army, the ''Vorl\u00e4ufige Reichswehr''. The terms of the [[Treaty of Versailles]] were announced in May, and in June, Germany signed the treaty that, among other terms, imposed severe constraints on the size of Germany's armed forces. The army was limited to one hundred thousand men with an additional fifteen thousand in the navy. The fleet was to consist of at most six [[battleship]]s, six [[cruiser]]s, and twelve [[destroyer]]s. [[Submarine]]s, [[tank]]s and heavy [[artillery]] were forbidden and the air-force was dissolved. A new post-war military, the ''[[Reichswehr]]'', was established on 23 March 1921. [[Conscription|General conscription]] was abolished under another mandate of the Versailles treaty.{{sfn|Craig|1980|pp=424\u2013432}}\n\nThe ''Reichswehr'' was limited to 115,000 men, and thus the armed forces, under the leadership of [[Hans von Seeckt]], retained only the most capable officers. The American historians Alan Millet and [[Williamson Murray]] wrote \"In reducing the officers corps, Seeckt chose the new leadership from the best men of the general staff with ruthless disregard for other constituencies, such as war heroes and the nobility\".{{sfn|Murray|Millett|2001|p=22}} Seeckt's determination that the ''Reichswehr'' be an elite cadre force that would serve as the nucleus of an expanded military when the chance for restoring conscription came essentially led to the creation of a new army, based upon, but very different from, the army that existed in World War I.{{sfn|Murray|Millett|2001|p=22}} In the 1920s, Seeckt and his officers developed new doctrines that emphasized speed, aggression, combined arms and initiative on the part of lower officers to take advantage of momentary opportunities.{{sfn|Murray|Millett|2001|p=22}} Though Seeckt retired in 1926, the army that went to war in 1939 was largely his creation.{{sfn|Wheeler-Bennett|1967|p=22}}\n\nGermany was forbidden to have an air force by the Versailles treaty; nonetheless, Seeckt created a clandestine cadre of air force officers in the early 1920s. These officers saw the role of an air force as winning air superiority, tactical and strategic bombing and providing ground support. That the ''Luftwaffe'' did not develop a strategic bombing force in the 1930s was not due to a lack of interest, but because of economic limitations.{{sfn|Murray|Millett|2001|p=33}} The leadership of the Navy led by Grand Admiral [[Erich Raeder]], a close prot\u00e9g\u00e9 of [[Alfred von Tirpitz]], was dedicated to the idea of reviving Tirpitz's High Seas Fleet. Officers who believed in submarine warfare led by Admiral [[Karl D\u00f6nitz]] were in a minority before 1939.{{sfn|Murray|Millett|2001|p=37}}\n\nBy 1922, Germany had begun covertly circumventing the conditions of the Versailles treaty. A secret collaboration with the [[Soviet Union]] began after the [[Treaty of Rapallo (1922)|Treaty of Rapallo]].{{sfn|Wheeler-Bennett|1967|p=131}} Major-General {{ill|Otto Hasse (General)|de|Otto Hasse (General)|lt=Otto Hasse}} traveled to Moscow in 1923 to further negotiate the terms.

The proverbial efficiency was even greater than previously thought, because the superiority of the opponent was much higher than at that time German officers suspected. The analysis of Russian archive files finally gives us a clear picture in this regard.\"{{sfn|B\u00f6nisch|Wiegrefe|2008|p=51}} Strategic thinker and professor [[Colin S.

It consisted of the ''[[German Army (1935\u20131945)|Heer]]'' (army), the ''[[Kriegsmarine]]'' (navy) and the ''[[Luftwaffe]]'' (air force). The designation \"''Wehrmacht''\" replaced the previously used term ''[[Reichswehr]]'', and was the manifestation of the Nazi regime's efforts to [[German re-armament|rearm Germany]] to a greater extent than the [[Treaty of Versailles]] permitted.{{sfn|Taylor|1995|pp=90\u2013119}}\n\nAfter the [[Adolf Hitler's rise to power|Nazi rise to power]] in 1933, one of [[Adolf Hitler]]'s most overt and audacious moves was to establish the ''Wehrmacht'', a modern offensively-capable armed force, fulfilling the Nazi regime's long-term goals of regaining lost territory as well as gaining new territory and dominating its neighbours. This required the reinstatement of conscription, and massive investment and [[defense spending]] on the [[arms industry]].{{sfn|Kitchen|1994|pp=39\u201365}}\n\nThe ''Wehrmacht'' formed the heart of Germany's politico-military power. In the early part of the [[World War II|Second World War]], the ''Wehrmacht'' employed combined arms tactics (close cover air-support, tanks, and infantry) to devastating effect in what became known as ''[[Blitzkrieg]]'' (lightning war). Its campaigns in [[Battle of France|France (1940)]], the [[Operation Barbarossa|Soviet Union (1941)]], and [[North African Campaign|North Africa (1941/42)]] are regarded as acts of boldness.{{sfn|Van Creveld|1982|p=3}} At the same time, the far-flung advances strained the ''Wehrmacht's'' capacity to the breaking point, culminating in the first major defeat in the [[Battle of Moscow]] (1941); by late 1942, Germany was losing the initiative in all theatres. The operational art was no match to the war-making abilities of the Allied coalition, making the ''Wehrmacht's'' weaknesses in strategy, doctrine, and logistics readily apparent.{{sfn|M\u00fcller|2016|pp=58\u201359}}\n\nClosely cooperating with the [[Schutzstaffel|''SS'']] and the ''[[Einsatzgruppen]]'', the German armed forces committed numerous [[Wehrmacht war crimes|war crimes]], despite later denials and promotion of the [[myth of the clean Wehrmacht|myth of the clean ''Wehrmacht'']].{{sfn|Hartmann|2013|pp=85\u2013108}} The majority of the war crimes were committed in the Soviet Union, Poland, Yugoslavia, Greece and Italy, as part of the [[war of annihilation]] against the Soviet Union, [[the Holocaust]] and [[Nazi security warfare]].\n\nDuring the war about 18 million men served in the ''Wehrmacht''.{{Sfnm|1a1=Overmans|1y=2004|1p=215|2a1=M\u00fcller|2y=2016|2p=16|3a1=Wette|3y=2006|3p=77}} By the time the war ended in Europe in May 1945, German forces (consisting of the [[German Army (1935\u20131945)|''Heer'']], the [[Kriegsmarine|''Kriegsmarine'']], the ''[[Luftwaffe]]'', the ''[[Waffen-SS]]'', the ''[[Volkssturm]]'', and [[Wehrmacht foreign volunteers and conscripts|foreign collaborateur units]]) had lost approximately 11,300,000 men,{{sfn|Fritz|2011| p=470}} about half of whom were missing or killed during the war.

The [[Frankfurt Constitution]] of 1849 designated all German military forces as the \"German ''Wehrmacht''\", consisting of the ''Seemacht'' (sea force) and the ''Landmacht'' (land force).{{sfn|Huber|2000}} In 1919, the term ''Wehrmacht'' also appears in Article 47 of the [[Weimar Constitution]], establishing that: \"The Reich's President holds supreme command of all armed forces [i.e. the ''Wehrmacht''] of the Reich\". From 1919, Germany's national defense force was known as the ''[[Reichswehr]]'', a name that was dropped in favor of ''Wehrmacht'' on 21 May 1935.{{sfn|Strohn|2010|p=10}}\n\n=== Background ===\n[[File:Bundesarchiv_Bild_102-16108,_Vereidigung_von_Reichswehr-Soldaten_auf_Hitler.jpg|alt=|thumb|253x253px|''Reichswehr'' soldiers swearing the [[Hitler oath]] in August 1934]]\nIn January 1919, after [[World War I]] ended with the signing of the [[Armistice with Germany (Compi\u00e8gne)|armistice of 11 November 1918]], the armed forces were dubbed ''Friedensheer'' (peace army).{{sfn|Wheeler-Bennett|1967|p=60}} In March 1919, the national assembly passed a law founding a 420,000-strong preliminary army, the ''Vorl\u00e4ufige Reichswehr''. The terms of the [[Treaty of Versailles]] were announced in May, and in June, Germany signed the treaty that, among other terms, imposed severe constraints on the size of Germany's armed forces. The army was limited to one hundred thousand men with an additional fifteen thousand in the navy. The fleet was to consist of at most six [[battleship]]s, six [[cruiser]]s, and twelve [[destroyer]]s. [[Submarine]]s, [[tank]]s and heavy [[artillery]] were forbidden and the air-force was dissolved. A new post-war military, the ''[[Reichswehr]]'', was established on 23 March 1921. [[Conscription|General conscription]] was abolished under another mandate of the Versailles treaty.{{sfn|Craig|1980|pp=424\u2013432}}\n\nThe ''Reichswehr'' was limited to 115,000 men, and thus the armed forces, under the leadership of [[Hans von Seeckt]], retained only the most capable officers. The American historians Alan Millet and [[Williamson Murray]] wrote \"In reducing the officers corps, Seeckt chose the new leadership from the best men of the general staff with ruthless disregard for other constituencies, such as war heroes and the nobility\".{{sfn|Murray|Millett|2001|p=22}} Seeckt's determination that the ''Reichswehr'' be an elite cadre force that would serve as the nucleus of an expanded military when the chance for restoring conscription came essentially led to the creation of a new army, based upon, but very different from, the army that existed in World War I.{{sfn|Murray|Millett|2001|p=22}} In the 1920s, Seeckt and his officers developed new doctrines that emphasized speed, aggression, combined arms and initiative on the part of lower officers to take advantage of momentary opportunities.{{sfn|Murray|Millett|2001|p=22}} Though Seeckt retired in 1926, the army that went to war in 1939 was largely his creation.{{sfn|Wheeler-Bennett|1967|p=22}}\n\nGermany was forbidden to have an air force by the Versailles treaty; nonetheless, Seeckt created a clandestine cadre of air force officers in the early 1920s. These officers saw the role of an air force as winning air superiority, tactical and strategic bombing and providing ground support. That the ''Luftwaffe'' did not develop a strategic bombing force in the 1930s was not due to a lack of interest, but because of economic limitations.{{sfn|Murray|Millett|2001|p=33}} The leadership of the Navy led by Grand Admiral [[Erich Raeder]], a close prot\u00e9g\u00e9 of [[Alfred von Tirpitz]], was dedicated to the idea of reviving Tirpitz's High Seas Fleet.

Rear-echelon personnel were more often sent to front-line duty wherever possible, especially during the final two years of the war where, inspired by constant propaganda, the oldest and [[Hitler Youth|youngest]] were being recruited and driven by instilled fear and fanaticism to serve on the fronts and, often, to fight to the death, whether judged to be cannon fodder or elite troops.{{sfn|U.S. War Department|1945|p=I-3}}\n\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 101I-177-1465-16, Griechenland, Soldaten der \"Legion Freies Arabien\".jpg|thumb|An African soldier of the [[Free Arabian Legion]]|alt=An African in German uniform sitting on a chair, next to two other soldiers having a cigarette]]\nPrior to World War II, the ''Wehrmacht'' strove to remain a purely ethnic German force; as such, minorities within and outside of Germany, such as the Czechs in annexed [[Czechoslovakia]], were exempted from military service after Hitler's takeover in 1938.

The proverbial efficiency was even greater than previously thought, because the superiority of the opponent was much higher than at that time German officers suspected. The analysis of Russian archive files finally gives us a clear picture in this regard.\"{{sfn|B\u00f6nisch|Wiegrefe|2008|p=51}} Strategic thinker and professor [[Colin S.

As part of a revitalization effort, One Main Development constructed two new mixed-use buildings: One Main and M2 on Neil. The City of Champaign gave $3.7 million in tax incentives for the building of M2 and agreed to pay nearly $11 million for a new parking deck.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tmcnet.com/usubmit/2006/12/14/2172078.htm |title=TMCnet.com |publisher=TMCnet.com |date=|accessdate=2011-08-05}}</ref>\n\nThis growth in downtown Champaign coincided with the larger growth of the \"north Prospect\" shopping district on the city's northern boundary. The growth in the north Prospect area relied, in part, on leapfrogging, moving out to the countryside and developing more remote farm land that eventually connects to the main development. Given the overwhelming success of such suburban shopping areas nationally, new development within any city center represented an alternative to the dominant movement out and away from the cities.\n\n[[File:Downtown Champaign Alley.JPG|thumb|North view of one of several alleyways in Downtown Champaign]]\nIn April 2007, One Main Development broke ground on M2 on Neil, a nine-story, $40 million, mixed-use project \u2013 the largest ever for downtown Champaign \u2013 located at the corner of Neil and Church Street.

Since opening in 1923, Memorial Stadium has been home to [[Illinois Fighting Illini football]].  The stadium also was the temporary home of the NFL's [[Chicago Bears]] for the 2002 season while its regular venue [[Soldier Field]] was being renovated.\n\n====State Farm Center====\nOriginally known as the Assembly Hall, the [[State Farm Center]] is home to the [[Illinois Fighting Illini men's basketball]] and [[Illinois Fighting Illini women's basketball]] teams.  It holds the annual Broadway Series, which features popular musicals.\n\n===Minor League Baseball===\nDuring its history, the city has been home to several separate minor league baseball clubs. The first in 1889 was a shared club between Champaign and [[Logansport, Indiana]] called the Logansport/Champaign-Urbana Clippers. The Clippers played for one season in the [[Illinois\u2013Indiana League]] before folding.<ref>[https://www.baseball-reference.com/minors/team.cgi?id=3722489a 1889 Logansport/Champaign-Urbana Clippers Statistics \u2013 Minor Leagues].

The city's Champaign County Colts were a founding member of the [[Central Illinois Collegiate League]] from 1963\u20131964. In 1990 the Colts were revived as the Champaign-Urbana Colts until the team folded in 1996.

Unit 4 administers both [[Champaign Central High School]] and [[Centennial High School (Champaign, Illinois)|Champaign Centennial High School]].\n\nChampaign is also served by two [[Private school|private]] high schools. The larger of the two is a [[Catholic schools in the United States|Roman Catholic]] [[High school (North America)|High school]], [[St. Thomas More High School (Champaign, Illinois)|St. Thomas More High School]] which is located on the city's far northwest side. The school opened in 2000 and is the newest charter of the [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Peoria]].\n\nThe other is [[Judah Christian School]], which is located just south of [[Interstate 74 in Illinois|I-74]] on Prospect Avenue. Judah Christian opened in 1983 and serves about 120 9th- 12th grade students. The entire school's pre-K through 12th grade enrollment is a little more than 500 students.\n\n===Higher education===\nLocated within Champaign are two institutions of higher education, the [[University of Illinois at Urbana\u2013Champaign]] and [[Parkland College]].\n\n==Transportation==\nChampaign is served by [[Interstate 57|I-57]], [[Interstate 72|I-72]], [[Interstate 74|I-74]], two [[railroad]] lines, and the University of Illinois operated [[University of Illinois Willard Airport|Willard Airport]] (CMI).\n\nIn 2009, the Champaign-Urbana metropolitan statistical area (MSA) ranked as the fourth highest in the United States for percentage of commuters who walked to work (9 percent).<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/prod/2011pubs/acs-15.pdf|series=American Community Survey Reports|title=Commuting in the United States: 2009|access-date=December 26, 2017|date=September 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170726134351/https://www.census.gov/prod/2011pubs/acs-15.pdf|archive-date=2017-07-26|url-status=dead}}</ref> In 2013, the Champaign-Urbana MSA ranked as the eleventh lowest in the United States for percentage of workers who commuted by private automobile (78.4 percent).

A spur line from the Canadian National line provides service to several large industries, including two large food processing plants, on the west edge of Champaign and two grain elevators in outlying communities to the west. The [[Norfolk Southern Railway|Norfolk Southern]] operates an east to west line through Champaign. The NS line connects industries in eastern Urbana to the Norfolk Southern main line at [[Mansfield, Illinois]], west of Champaign. The line now operated by Norfolk Southern is the former [[Peoria & Eastern Railway]], later operated as part of the Big Four ([[Cleveland, Cincinnati, Chicago and St. Louis Railway]]), [[New York Central]], [[Penn Central Transportation|Penn Central]], and [[Conrail]] systems, being sold by Conrail to Norfolk Southern in 1996. Construction of the line was begun by the Danville, Urbana, Bloomington and Pekin Railroad.

Although his college education was interrupted by three years as an army private in Europe during World War II, he ultimately earned his bachelor's, master's, and doctoral degrees at the [[University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill]]. Although he never returned there to live, his Depression-era boyhood in the Cape Fear region, spent accompanying his grandfather to auctions and clerking at his father's general store, informed his writing, providing him with a lifetime of material for his fiction and poetry.\n\nIn the years between earning his M.A. and his Ph.D., Owen taught briefly at [[Davidson College]] and [[Elon College]]. During a four-year stint as an associate professor at [[Stetson University]] in Florida, he published his first poetry collection, and founded ''Impetus'', the literary magazine which would evolve into the ''Southern Poetry Review''. In 1960, he published his first novel, ''Season of Fear'', a Depression-era story set in a rural community. The story of one man's struggle between religion and sex was critically well received, but its seriousness left Owen ready to write some lighter fiction. ''The Ballad of the Flim-Flam Man'' follows the comic adventures of an aging confidence man and his young AWOL sidekick in a thinly fictionalized Bladen County. Mordecai Jones and the guitar playing Curley Treadaway were to become two of Owen's favorite characters. The book was made into a movie in 1967 (''[[The Flim-Flam Man]]'') starring [[George C. Scott]] and [[Michael Sarrazin]], and the characters reappeared in two more books to \"con\" the greedy and gullible who only get what they deserve. The 1970 novel ''Journey for Joedel'' won the Sir Walter Raleigh Award for best work of fiction by a North Carolinian.\n\nIn 1962, Owen took a position at [[North Carolina State University]]. He continued over the years to publish stories and poems. His collection ''The White Stallion and Other Poems'' won a Roanoke-Chowan cup for poetry by a North Carolina poet. He co-edited several anthologies of state and regional verse, lectured and conducted workshops across the state for writers of all levels, participated in the \"poetry in the schools\" program, and directed the North Carolina Poetry Circuit, which brought together poets and college students.\n\nAs a writer and teacher of writing, Guy Owen adhered to two principles. The first was specificity: \"Never write 'flower': write '[[rose]]' or '[[Tagetes|marigold]]' or '[[chrysanthemum]].'\" The second was \"Make your reader comfortable,\" meaning that a writer should give enough information in a clear style to enable the reader to easily enter the writer's world. Owen's many honors include a Bread Loaf Scholarship, the Henry H.
