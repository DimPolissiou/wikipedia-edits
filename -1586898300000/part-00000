Six heads of state attended the 2008 breakfast, along with Members of the [[European Parliament]]; United Nations diplomats; European, Asian, African and Latin American politicians; religious leaders; missionaries working in various countries; U.S. and foreign business leaders; and students. [[Benazir Bhutto]], former prime minister of [[Pakistan]], participated on more than one occasion, and a video interview of her speaking about the National Prayer Breakfast, its meaning and its impact on her faith, was featured at the 2008 closing dinner.

[[Jim Wallis]], founder and president of the Christian social change group [[Sojourners]] and a regular attendee of the National Prayer Breakfast, said of the event \"it's sort of a time to \u2014 where people want to acknowledge the importance of prayer and faith.  And that can be kind of a civil religion, civic faith kind of common denominator thing. Or it can be much too sectarian where some people feel left out of it. I remember my favorite ones are when Bono spoke at the prayer breakfast and talked about every faith tradition calls us to stand with those who are left out, left behind. I remember Senator [[Mark Hatfield]] spoke years ago when I was in seminary and he called the war in Vietnam a national sin and shame in front of [[Richard Nixon]] and [[Henry Kissinger]].  I saw their faces and they weren't happy with that. So when it can raise up issues that we ought to be accountable to, whether we are religious or not, I think that's when it's probably at its best.\"<ref>{{cite news|url = https://www.npr.org/2011/02/04/133497426/President-Obama-Gets-Personal-At-National-Prayer-Breakfast |title = President Gets Personal at National Prayer Breakfast|publisher=NPR|date=February 4, 2011}}</ref>\n\nIn 2010, [[Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington]] asked President [[Barack Obama]] and Congressional leaders to refrain from attending the National Prayer Breakfast.

And that can be kind of a civil religion, civic faith kind of common denominator thing. Or it can be much too sectarian where some people feel left out of it. I remember my favorite ones are when Bono spoke at the prayer breakfast and talked about every faith tradition calls us to stand with those who are left out, left behind. I remember Senator [[Mark Hatfield]] spoke years ago when I was in seminary and he called the war in Vietnam a national sin and shame in front of [[Richard Nixon]] and [[Henry Kissinger]].

They pre-dated the electric [[mobility scooter]]s and from the 1920s were generally powered by a small gasoline/petrol engine, although some were battery powered. They were usually designed without foot-operated controls.\n\n==History==\n===Origins===\n[[Stephan Farffler]] was a [[Nuremberg]] [[watchmaker]] of the seventeenth century whose invention of a manumotive carriage in 1655 is widely considered to have been the first self-propelled [[wheelchair]]. He is believed to have been either a [[Paraplegia|paraplegic]]<ref>Jane Bidder, ''Inventions We Use to Go Places'' (London: Franklin Watts, 2006, 18)</ref><ref>[[Rory A.

T. Batsford, 1985, 136)</ref> As such, the chair was consistent with the later designs for self-propelled invalid carriages. The three-wheeled device is also believed to have been a precursor to the modern-day [[tricycle]] and [[bicycle]].<ref>\"Medical Innovations - Wheelchair,\" ''Science Reporter, Volume 44'', 2007, 397.</ref> \n\nIn England the fore-runner of the invalid carriage was the [[Bath chair|bath chair]]. It was invented by James Heath, of Bath in the early 18th century.<ref>[http://www.cityofbath.co.uk/history/body_bathchair.html Bath chair] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080519222501/http://www.cityofbath.co.uk/history/body_bathchair.html |date=May 19, 2008 }}.

The Argson Runnymede was designed in South Africa manufactured in England from 1936 to 1954. They were either battery-powered or had a Villiers petrol engine. A petrol powered Runnymede drove across the Alps in 1947.  Stanley Engineering was bought by C B Harper Ltd in 1954.<ref>[http://www.bonhams.com/auctions/19288/lot/500/ Lot 500 1946 Argson Runnymede Invalid Carriage Registration no. KPK 117]</ref>\n\nR A Harding Company of Bath was founded in 1921. They initially produced hand-propelled tricycles. In 1926 Harding's introduced a variety of powered invalid carriages. The De Luxe models A and B were powered by a 122cc Villier-and the Pultney was powered by either a 200cc or 300cc JAP. There were also 24-volt or 36-volt electric machines. In 1945, the company was renamed R A Harding (Bath) Ltd, and the Pultney was discontinued. In December 1948 the De Luxe moels were upgraded with larger rear wheels, a new petrol tank, and a fan-cooled Villiers 147cc unit. Hardings introduced a full bodied model in 1956 called the Consort. Only 12 of these were made. The company closed down in 1988 having made hand powered models until 1973 and motor drive ones until 1966.<ref>https://www.flickr.com/photos/26237061@N07/6261815278 retrieved 14 July 2018</ref>\n\nFrom the 1930s to late 1940s, Nelco Industries made a three-wheeled battery powered vehicle. Steering was by means of a tiller connected to the front wheel. The tiller also provided speed control. Forward or reverse by a separate control. The 24 volt electric motor could act as a generator to recharge the battery when going downhill. The motor was 24 volt.<ref>[http://www.nzmuseums.co.nz/account/3328/object/1688 Nelco Solocar; Nelco Industries England; 1930s; 2008-20]</ref>\n\n===United Kingdom Ministry of Health contracts (1948-1978)===\n<gallery mode=packed>\nFile:AC Invacar model 57 (NPB 860D).jpg|AC model 57\nFile:Gordon 1956 schr\u00e4g 8.JPG|1956 Vernon Industries Gordon\nFile:Invacar 1973 (4).JPG|1973 Invacar\nFile:Tippen Delta.JPG|Tippen Delta\n</gallery>\nIn 1948, [[Bert Greeves]] adapted a motorcycle with the help of his paralysed cousin Derry Preston-Cobb as transport for Preston-Cobb.

They pre-dated the electric [[mobility scooter]]s and from the 1920s were generally powered by a small gasoline/petrol engine, although some were battery powered. They were usually designed without foot-operated controls.\n\n==History==\n===Origins===\n[[Stephan Farffler]] was a [[Nuremberg]] [[watchmaker]] of the seventeenth century whose invention of a manumotive carriage in 1655 is widely considered to have been the first self-propelled [[wheelchair]]. He is believed to have been either a [[Paraplegia|paraplegic]]<ref>Jane Bidder, ''Inventions We Use to Go Places'' (London: Franklin Watts, 2006, 18)</ref><ref>[[Rory A.

The three-wheeled device is also believed to have been a precursor to the modern-day [[tricycle]] and [[bicycle]].<ref>\"Medical Innovations - Wheelchair,\" ''Science Reporter, Volume 44'', 2007, 397.</ref> \n\nIn England the fore-runner of the invalid carriage was the [[Bath chair|bath chair]].

The Argson Runnymede was designed in South Africa manufactured in England from 1936 to 1954. They were either battery-powered or had a Villiers petrol engine. A petrol powered Runnymede drove across the Alps in 1947.  Stanley Engineering was bought by C B Harper Ltd in 1954.<ref>[http://www.bonhams.com/auctions/19288/lot/500/ Lot 500 1946 Argson Runnymede Invalid Carriage Registration no. KPK 117]</ref>\n\nR A Harding Company of Bath was founded in 1921. They initially produced hand-propelled tricycles. In 1926 Harding's introduced a variety of powered invalid carriages. The De Luxe models A and B were powered by a 122cc Villier-and the Pultney was powered by either a 200cc or 300cc JAP. There were also 24-volt or 36-volt electric machines. In 1945, the company was renamed R A Harding (Bath) Ltd, and the Pultney was discontinued. In December 1948 the De Luxe moels were upgraded with larger rear wheels, a new petrol tank, and a fan-cooled Villiers 147cc unit. Hardings introduced a full bodied model in 1956 called the Consort. Only 12 of these were made. The company closed down in 1988 having made hand powered models until 1973 and motor drive ones until 1966.<ref>https://www.flickr.com/photos/26237061@N07/6261815278 retrieved 14 July 2018</ref>\n\nFrom the 1930s to late 1940s, Nelco Industries made a three-wheeled battery powered vehicle. Steering was by means of a tiller connected to the front wheel. The tiller also provided speed control. Forward or reverse by a separate control. The 24 volt electric motor could act as a generator to recharge the battery when going downhill. The motor was 24 volt.<ref>[http://www.nzmuseums.co.nz/account/3328/object/1688 Nelco Solocar; Nelco Industries England; 1930s; 2008-20]</ref>\n\n===United Kingdom Ministry of Health contracts (1948-1978)===\n<gallery mode=packed>\nFile:AC Invacar model 57 (NPB 860D).jpg|AC model 57\nFile:Gordon 1956 schr\u00e4g 8.JPG|1956 Vernon Industries Gordon\nFile:Invacar 1973 (4).JPG|1973 Invacar\nFile:Tippen Delta.JPG|Tippen Delta\n</gallery>\nIn 1948, [[Bert Greeves]] adapted a motorcycle with the help of his paralysed cousin Derry Preston-Cobb as transport for Preston-Cobb.

Production of them stopped in 1976, and the last were withdrawn from the road in 2003, though some still exist and approximately 25 Invacars survive that could become roadworthy once again. There are at least 5 Invacars in private ownership which are road legal and several other un-roadworthy examples which are awaiting their demise, one in the Coventry Transport Museum collection, two in the Lakeland museum in Cumbria, one road-going example \"TWC\" features on the HubNut YouTube channel. Another 1976 example, one of the last made, can be found on display at the [[National Motor Museum, Beaulieu]] in [[Hampshire]], England.<ref>[http://www.nationalmotormuseum.org.uk/?location_id=335&item=17&offset=0 National Motor Museum (UK): List of Vehicles in the Collection]</ref>\n\nIn Britain in the 1960s and 1970s, [[Invacar|invalid carriages]] were provided as a subsidised low-cost vehicle to aid mobility of people with disabilities. Vehicles supplied by the [[National Health Service]] had 3 wheels, were very lightweight, and therefore their suitability on roads among other traffic was often considered dubious on safety grounds.
