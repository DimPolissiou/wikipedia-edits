Bang Jeong-hwan first coined the modern Korean word for children, ''eorini'' (\uc5b4\ub9b0\uc774), replacing the previous words ''aenom'' (\uc560\ub188) and ''esaekki'' (\uc560\uc0c8\ub07c).<ref>{{cite book | last1 = Jung (\uc815) | first1 = Im-jo (\uc784\uc870) | title = \uc5b4\ub9b0\uc774\uc5d0\uac8c \uafc8\uacfc \ud76c\ub9dd\uc744 \uc900 \uc774\uc57c\uae30\uafbc \ubc29\uc815\ud658 | url = http://www.aladin.co.kr/shop/wproduct.aspx?ISBN=8962680718 | accessdate = 26 August 2011 | quote = \ub354\ubd88\uc5b4 \ubc29\uc815\ud658 \uc120\uc0dd\ub2d8\uc740 '\uc560\ub188' '\uc560\uc0c8\ub07c' '\uc790\uc2dd \ub188\u2019\uc774\ub77c \ubd88\ub9ac\ub358 \uc544\uc774\ub4e4\uc5d0\uac8c '\uc5b4\ub9b0\uc774\u2019\ub77c\ub294 \uc544\ub984\ub2e4\uc6b4 \ub9d0\uc744 \uc120\ubb3c\ud588\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.}}</ref> Until 1939, Japanese authorities based in Seoul oppressed the movement to stop Korean social activists congregating for the festival.

It is celebrated annually on November 20. Besides, many countries have their own national holidays to celebrate children. For example,\u00a0Children\u2019s Day in [[Myanmar]]\u00a0(former Burma) is celebrated on February 13.\n\nThe date of Myanmar\u2019s Children\u2019s Day coincides with the birthday of [[Aung San]], a Burmese revolutionary, politician and general who is considered the Father of the Nation in present-day Myanmar. He fought for Burma\u2019s independence from [[Japan]] and the [[United Kingdom]]. It was decided to celebrate Aung San\u2019s birthday as Children\u2019s Day because '''he fought for a better future for Burmese children'''.\n\nIn the late 1980s, a military dictatorship was established in Myanmar. Naturally, the military government didn't encourage the celebration of Aung San\u2019s birthday and, by extension, Children\u2019s Day.\n\nThe situation began to change after the 2011\u20132012 democratic reforms. Today, Children\u2019s Day is officially celebrated in schools across Myanmar.\n\nOn February 13, Burmese schools host special events for students. Their main goal is to emphasize the importance of education for the future of [[Myanmar|Burmese]] children, as well as to raise awareness of the problems that children and their parents face on a daily basis.\n\n(This is a direct copy of the original).<ref>https://anydayguide.com/calendar/3482</ref>\n\n===Mexico===\nIn [[Mexico]], Children's Day (\"D\u00eda Del Ni\u00f1o\") is celebrated on April 30.  On this day teachers in schools organize the day for their children.  In some schools, lessons are suspended for the day.  They organize games, music, and the children bring in their favorite foods to share with others.  Some families also have a day out with their children.  There are special activities for children in parks and sports centers.  Sometimes, also, the children will be given presents by their families.  This is the day when children are honored in Mexico.

The two main themes of the holiday are \"Stop violence against children\" and \"Give a child the chance to express their opinion today\". After the march, there are speeches and activities organized by schools, including a dance. Then, after midday, children return home to spend time with their parents for the rest of the day. Children's Day is a public holiday, set up following a recommendation of the Committee on the Rights of the Child. A group of people in the United Nations monitor and protect children's rights. A committee, with both adult and child members, organizes activities. In the past, a committee of adults has chosen the theme \u2013 but in the future children may help choose it.\n\nChildren's Day originally took place only in the capital of Vanuatu, but it has now been extended to all 6 provinces. Schools, churches, local governments of the provinces and other local organizations all organize activities. Save the Children supports one Children's Day activity in each province, selecting it from the many requests they receive for support. In 2008, one of the activities supported by Save the Children was a sports day between many different schools.\n\nParents and caretakers have been supportive of Children's Day activities. Many parents come to activities with children. In one province, children and parents from five different schools came together for a shared lunch. Some parents give their children presents for Children's Day \u2013 however, Save the Children try to spread the message that it doesn't matter if a parent can't afford to buy their child a present, as the real aim of Children's Day is for parents and children to spend the day together, and work together to reconcile their problems.\n\n=== Venezuela ===\nIn [[Venezuela]], Children's Day is celebrated the third Sunday of July.\n\n=== Vietnam ===\n[[File:Den ong sao.JPG|thumb|Mid-Autumn Festival in [[Vietnam]]]]\n\nIn [[Vietnam]], Children's Day is celebrated on 1 June as ICD and on the full moon of the 8th lunar month during the [[Mid-Autumn Festival]].\n\n=== Zimbabwe ===\nChildren's Day was established as a holiday in [[Zimbabwe]] in 1991 ([[International Day of the African Child|Day of the African Child]]).\n\n==See also==\n* [[Children's Day Festival]]\n* [[Convention on the Rights of the Child]]\n* [[World Youth Day]]\n* [[Street children]]\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n=== Sources ===\n*{{cite book |last=Douglas |first=George William |title=[https://2019trendingnews.blogspot.com/2019/11/childrens-day-2019-history-and.html Children\u2019s Day 2019: History and significance] |page=355 }}\n\n== External links ==\n{{Commons category}}\n* [https://www.un.org/en/events/childrenday/ Universal Children's Day on United Nations website]\n* [https://www.thechildrensday.com/ Children's Day History and Quotes]\n\n{{Public holidays in Algeria}}\n{{Mexico Holidays}}\n{{Family}}\n\n[[Category:Children's Day| ]]\n[[Category:Public holidays in the Soviet Union]]\n[[Category:Public holidays in South Korea]]\n[[Category:Public holidays in Romania]]\n[[Category:United Nations days]]\n[[Category:Family member holidays]]\n[[Category:January observances]]\n[[Category:February observances]]\n[[Category:March observances]]\n[[Category:April observances]]\n[[Category:May observances]]\n[[Category:June observances]]\n[[Category:July observances]]\n[[Category:August observances]]\n[[Category:September observances]]\n[[Category:October observances]]\n[[Category:November observances]]\n[[Category:December observances]]\n[[Category:Holidays and observances by scheduling (nth weekday of the month)]]\n[[Category:Sunday observances]]\n[[Category:Monday observances]]\n[[Category:Wednesday observances]]\n[[Category:Friday observances]]\n[[Category:Saturday observances]]\n", "text_old": "{{Use dmy dates|date=October 2019}}\n{{more citations needed|date=March 2018}}\n{{Infobox holiday\n|holiday_name  = World Children's Day\n|type          = Cultural\n|longtype      = Cultural, commercial\n|image         = Wikipedia Children's Day.png\n|caption       = Wikipedia logo for Children's Day\n|official_name = World Children's Day\n|nickname      = Universal Children's Day \n|observedby    = [[list of minor secular observances#November|International]] ([[United Nations|UN]])\n|begins        = November 20\n|ends          = November 21\n|date          = November 20\n|week_ordinal  =\n|weekday       = Friday \n|month         = November \n|celebrations  =\n|duration      = 1 day\n|scheduling    = 3rd weekday of the month\n|frequency     = Annual\n|observances   =\n|relatedto     = International Children's Day, [[Siblings Day]], [[International Men's Day]], [[International Women's Day]], [[Father's Day]], [[Mother's Day]], [[Parents' Day]]\n}}\n'''Children's Day''' is a commemorative date celebrated annually in honor of children, whose actual day varies by country.\n\nIn 1925, International Children's Day was first proclaimed in Geneva during the World Conference on Child Welfare; since then, it is celebrated on June 1 in most countries.

After the march, there are speeches and activities organized by schools, including a dance. Then, after midday, children return home to spend time with their parents for the rest of the day. Children's Day is a public holiday, set up following a recommendation of the Committee on the Rights of the Child. A group of people in the United Nations monitor and protect children's rights. A committee, with both adult and child members, organizes activities. In the past, a committee of adults has chosen the theme \u2013 but in the future children may help choose it.\n\nChildren's Day originally took place only in the capital of Vanuatu, but it has now been extended to all 6 provinces. Schools, churches, local governments of the provinces and other local organizations all organize activities. Save the Children supports one Children's Day activity in each province, selecting it from the many requests they receive for support. In 2008, one of the activities supported by Save the Children was a sports day between many different schools.\n\nParents and caretakers have been supportive of Children's Day activities. Many parents come to activities with children. In one province, children and parents from five different schools came together for a shared lunch.
