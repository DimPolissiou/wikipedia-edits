[[PyeongChang]], [[South Korea]], from 9 to 25 February 2018. The [[Swedish Olympic Committee]] ([[Swedish language|Swedish]]: ''Sveriges Olympiska Kommitt\u00e9, SOK'') sent 116 athletes to the Games, 62 men and 54 women, to compete in nine sports. [[Jennie-Lee Burmansson]] set a new record as the youngest Swedish Winter Olympic participant. \n\nThe team was highly successful, having won 7 gold, 6 silver and 1 bronze medal and earning the 6th place in the [[2018 Winter Olympics medal table|medal table]]. The result matched the number of Winter Olympic gold medals won in Torino in 2006 but beat that record by having more silver medals. The overall medal count of 14 was only one short of Sweden's Winter Olympic record, set in Sochi in 2014 with 15 medals.\n\n==Medalists==\n{{col-begin}}\n| width=\"56%\" align=\"left\" valign=\"top\" |\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"font-size:95%;\"\n|-\n!

The Hai San members took 14 Ghee Hin as prisoners, 13 of whom were killed. The 14th escaped to inform his clan and the Ghee Hin retaliated by attacking a Hai San village, razing it to the ground and killing 40 men in the process. The battle continued back and forth and spread to [[Province Wellesley]] and the island of [[Penang]] while other secret societies started to join the fray. Both sides were later exhausted and finally decided to come to terms. An official inquiry took place and both the Hai San and Ghee Hin societies were fined $5,000 each for violating the peace of Penang and their leaders exiled.<ref>History of Malaya, 1400-1959, Joginder Singh Jessy, Jointly published by the United Publishers and Peninsular Publications, 1963, P152</ref><ref>Journal of the Malaysian Branch of the Royal Asiatic Society, Volume 64, MBRAS, 1991, P10</ref><ref>A portrait of Malaysia and Singapore, Soo Hai Ding Eing Tan, Oxford University Press, 1978, {{ISBN|0195807227}}, {{ISBN|9780195807226}}, P79</ref><ref>The impact of Chinese secret societies in Malaya: a historical study, Wilfred Blythe, Royal Institute of International Affairs, Issued under the auspices of the Royal Institute of International Affairs [by] Oxford U.P., 1969, P115</ref>\n\nBy around 1870, there were a combined total of about 40,000 Hakka and Cantonese mine workers in the Larut district and the mining areas between the two groups were near to each other.

Upon discovery, the adulterous couple was caught, tortured, put into a pig basket and thrown into a disused mining pond where they drowned. Avenging the death of their leader, Ghee Hin had 4,000 mercenaries imported from mainland China via Penang attack the Hai San and for the first time, the Hai San were driven out of Larut. About 10,000 Hai San men sought refuge in Penang. Months later, the Hai San supported by Ngah Ibrahim recovered their Matang and Larut mines.

Weeks after Hai Sans regained Larut, Ghee Hin, supported by Raja Abdullah, counter-attacked with arms and men from Singapore and China. Ngah Ibrahim's properties in Matang were destroyed. Local Malay residents were also killed and their property, destroyed. Trouble spread to Krian, [[Pangkor]] and [[Dinding]]. The quarrelling Malay chiefs who had taken sides in the Larut Wars were now alarmed at the disorder created by the Chinese miners and secret societies. The Straits Settlement Penang Chinese seeing their investments destroyed in the Larut Wars sought intervention from the British.

In the resulting [[Perak War]] (1875\u201376), the British retaliated by defeating the rebels, executing Lela and expelling both Raja Abdullah and Ngah Ibrahim to the [[Seychelles]] on the accusation that they had been involved in the conspiracy to assassinate Birch.

The Hai San members took 14 Ghee Hin as prisoners, 13 of whom were killed. The 14th escaped to inform his clan and the Ghee Hin retaliated by attacking a Hai San village, razing it to the ground and killing 40 men in the process. The battle continued back and forth and spread to [[Province Wellesley]] and the island of [[Penang]] while other secret societies started to join the fray. Both sides were later exhausted and finally decided to come to terms. An official inquiry took place and both the Hai San and Ghee Hin societies were fined $5,000 each for violating the peace of Penang and their leaders exiled.<ref>History of Malaya, 1400-1959, Joginder Singh Jessy, Jointly published by the United Publishers and Peninsular Publications, 1963, P152</ref><ref>Journal of the Malaysian Branch of the Royal Asiatic Society, Volume 64, MBRAS, 1991, P10</ref><ref>A portrait of Malaysia and Singapore, Soo Hai Ding Eing Tan, Oxford University Press, 1978, {{ISBN|0195807227}}, {{ISBN|9780195807226}}, P79</ref><ref>The impact of Chinese secret societies in Malaya: a historical study, Wilfred Blythe, Royal Institute of International Affairs, Issued under the auspices of the Royal Institute of International Affairs [by] Oxford U.P., 1969, P115</ref>\n\nBy around 1870, there were a combined total of about 40,000 Hakka and Cantonese mine workers in the Larut district and the mining areas between the two groups were near to each other.

W. Birch]] was assassinated in 1875 on the orders of [[Lela Pandak Lam]] (alias Dato Maharaja Lela). Lela was a prince and mufti from Upper Perak, who was either motivated to protect his economic interests by restoring [[slavery]] \u2013 which had been prohibited by the British \u2013 or restore independence to Perak \u2013 a view commonly held by modern Malaysian nationalists. In the resulting [[Perak War]] (1875\u201376), the British retaliated by defeating the rebels, executing Lela and expelling both Raja Abdullah and Ngah Ibrahim to the [[Seychelles]] on the accusation that they had been involved in the conspiracy to assassinate Birch. The British appointed [[Yusuf Sharifuddin Muzaffar Shah of Perak|Yusuf Sharifuddin Muzaffar Shah]] to regent of Perak in 1877, finally appointing him as the new sultan of Perak in 1886.\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist|26em}}\n\n== Further reading ==\n* [[Chung Keng Quee]]\n* Southeast Asia: a historical encyclopaedia, from Angkor Wat to East Timor, Volume 2Southeast Asia: A Historical Encyclopedia, from Angkor Wat to East Timor, Edited by Keat Gin Ooi, Published by ABC-CLIO, 2004, {{ISBN|1576077705}}, {{ISBN|9781576077702}}, P775\n* Ipoh: when tin was king By Ho Tak Ming, Perak Academy, 2009, {{ISBN|9834250029}}, {{ISBN|9789834250027}}, PP9&67\n* Thai south and Malay north: ethnic interactions on the plural Peninsula, Michael John Montesano, Patrick Jory, NUS Press, 2008, {{ISBN|9971694115}}, {{ISBN|9789971694111}}, P208\n* Fifteenth Report of the United States Civil Service Commission, Congressional edition, Volume 3826, United States Congress, US G.P.O., 1899, PP529, 530, 534\n* The New Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica, Volume 9, 2003, {{ISBN|0852299613}}, {{ISBN|9780852299616}}, PP113,278\n* Sir Frank Swettenham's Malayan journals, 1874-1876 by Sir Frank Athelstane Swettenham, illustrated, reprint, Oxford University Press, 1975\n* Nineteenth-century Malaya: the origins of British political control, Volume 11 of London oriental series, Charles Donald Cowan, Oxford University Press, 1967\n* In search of Southeast Asia: a modern history, David P.

It is a northern suburb of [[Metro Detroit]] and is approximately {{convert|20|mi|km}} northwest of [[Downtown Detroit]]. Except a small southern border with the city of [[Birmingham, Michigan|Birmingham]], the city is almost completely surrounded by [[Bloomfield Township, Oakland County, Michigan|Bloomfield Township]], but the city and township are administered automously. As of the [[2010 United States Census|2010 census]], the city's population was 3,869.\n\n==History==\n{{Unreferenced section|date=August 2014}}\nOn June 28, 1820, Oakland County was divided into two townships: [[Pontiac Township, Michigan|Pontiac Township]] and [[Bloomfield Township, Oakland County, Michigan|Bloomfield Township]], the latter covering the southern part of the county that would include [[West Bloomfield Township, Michigan|West Bloomfield Township]], [[Royal Oak, Michigan|Royal Oak]] and [[Southfield, Michigan|Southfield]]. What is now Bloomfield Hills was a farming area until the turn of the 20th century when wealthy Detroit residents bought up the land. The settlement became a village in 1927, and in 1932 residents voted to become a city to avoid being incorporated into growing [[Birmingham, Michigan|Birmingham]].\n\n==Culture==\n[[File:Cranbrook0031.JPG|thumb|left|Cranbrook gardens]]\nBloomfield Hills is the location of the [[List of National Historic Landmarks in Michigan|National Historic Landmark]] [[Cranbrook Educational Community]] and other historic sites listed on the national register of historic places.\n\nIn popular culture, Bloomfield Hills was the setting for the 2005 film ''[[The Upside of Anger]]''. In the 2002 film ''[[8 Mile (film)|8 Mile]]'', [[Eminem]] mentions Cranbrook Kingswood while making fun of \"Doc\" because he attended Cranbrook, which is not considered cool or impressive in the atmosphere portrayed in the film. Bloomfield Hills is the hometown of the comic book character, [[Trance (comics)|Trance]]. Some scenes in ''[[Out of Sight]]'' with [[Jennifer Lopez]] and [[George Clooney]] were filmed at a private residence in Bloomfield Hills. (In the novel by [[Elmore Leonard]] on which the film is based, the most prominent street in Bloomfield Hills is described as \u201cVaughan Road, nothing but money.\u201d<ref>{{Cite book | author=Leonard, Elmore| title= Out of Sight | year= 1996| publisher= Delacorte Press}}</ref>) [[Jimmy Hoffa]] was last seen at the former [[Machus Red Fox]] restaurant in adjacent Bloomfield Township.

As of the 2010 census, the city population was 3,869.\n\n==History==\n{{Unreferenced section|date=August 2014}}\nOn June 28, 1820, Oakland County was divided into two townships: [[Pontiac Township, Michigan|Pontiac Township]] and [[Bloomfield Township, Oakland County, Michigan|Bloomfield Township]], the latter covering the southern part of the county that would include [[West Bloomfield Township, Michigan|West Bloomfield Township]], [[Royal Oak, Michigan|Royal Oak]] and [[Southfield, Michigan|Southfield]]. What is now Bloomfield Hills was a farming area until the turn of the 20th century when wealthy Detroit residents bought up the land.

The university offers bachelor's, master's, and doctoral degrees.\n\nWright State's athletic teams compete in the [[Division I (NCAA)|NCAA Division I]] as a member of the [[Horizon League]], as the [[Wright State Raiders]].\n\n==History==\n===Founding===\nWright State University first opened in 1964 as a branch campus of [[Miami University]] and [[Ohio State University]], occupying only a single building. Groundwork on forming the institution began in 1961 during a time when the region lacked a public university for higher education. A community-wide fundraising effort was conducted in 1962 to establish the university, and the campaign raised the $3 million needed in [[seed money]].<ref name=\"History-WSU\">{{cite web|url=https://www.wright.edu/about/wright-state-history|title=Wright State History|publisher=Wright State University|accessdate=July 12, 2015}}</ref><ref name=\"History-WSULibrary\">{{cite web|url=http://www.libraries.wright.edu/special/university_archives/history.php|title=Wright State History - The Dayton Campus|publisher=Wright State University|accessdate=July 12, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150712035510/http://www.libraries.wright.edu/special/university_archives/history.php#|archive-date=2015-07-12|url-status=dead}}</ref> Much of the land that the campus was built on was donated by the [[United States Air Force]] from excess acreage of [[Wright-Patterson Air Force Base]].\n\nThe [[Ohio General Assembly]] passed legislation in 1965 that transformed the branch campus into a separate institution with its own Advisory Committee on November 5, 1965. It was anticipated the campus would achieve full independent status by 1967 with its rapidly increasing enrollment of full-time students, projected to reach 5,000 within two years. On October 1, 1967, the campus officially became Wright State University following a decision by the Ohio Board of Regents.

Originally a branch campus, Wright State became an independent institution in 1967 and was named in honor of the aviation pioneers [[Wright brothers|Orville and Wilbur Wright]], who were residents of nearby [[Dayton, Ohio|Dayton]]. The university offers bachelor's, master's, and doctoral degrees.\n\nWright State's athletic teams compete in the [[Division I (NCAA)|NCAA Division I]] as a member of the [[Horizon League]], as the [[Wright State Raiders]].\n\n==History==\n===Founding===\nWright State University first opened in 1964 as a branch campus of [[Miami University]] and [[Ohio State University]], occupying only a single building. Groundwork on forming the institution began in 1961 during a time when the region lacked a public university for higher education. A community-wide fundraising effort was conducted in 1962 to establish the university, and the campaign raised the $3 million needed in [[seed money]].<ref name=\"History-WSU\">{{cite web|url=https://www.wright.edu/about/wright-state-history|title=Wright State History|publisher=Wright State University|accessdate=July 12, 2015}}</ref><ref name=\"History-WSULibrary\">{{cite web|url=http://www.libraries.wright.edu/special/university_archives/history.php|title=Wright State History - The Dayton Campus|publisher=Wright State University|accessdate=July 12, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150712035510/http://www.libraries.wright.edu/special/university_archives/history.php#|archive-date=2015-07-12|url-status=dead}}</ref> Much of the land that the campus was built on was donated by the [[United States Air Force]] from excess acreage of [[Wright-Patterson Air Force Base]].\n\nThe [[Ohio General Assembly]] passed legislation in 1965 that transformed the branch campus into a separate institution with its own Advisory Committee on November 5, 1965. It was anticipated the campus would achieve full independent status by 1967 with its rapidly increasing enrollment of full-time students, projected to reach 5,000 within two years. On October 1, 1967, the campus officially became Wright State University following a decision by the Ohio Board of Regents. The name honors the [[Wright brothers]], well-known Dayton residents who are credited with inventing the world's first successful [[airplane]].<ref name=\"1966-67 Course Catalog\">{{cite web|url=http://corescholar.libraries.wright.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1002&context=archives_catalogs|title=1966\u20131967 University Course Catalog|year=1966|publisher=Wright State University|accessdate=July 12, 2015}}</ref><ref name=\"1968-69 Course Catalog\">{{cite web |url=http://corescholar.libraries.wright.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1004&context=archives_catalogs|title=1968\u20131969 Wright State University Course Catalog|year=1968|publisher=Wright State University|accessdate=July 12, 2015}}</ref> In 1969, a {{Convert|173|acre|adj=mid}} branch campus opened on the shore of [[Grand Lake St. Marys State Park|Grand Lake St. Marys]] in [[Celina, Ohio]]\n\n===Recent history===\nSusan Edwards is the university's current (interim) president, a role she began January 1, 2020.

After his graduation from USC in 1970, his first TV acting experience was a campus revolutionary in the TV series ''[[Dan August]]'' starring [[Burt Reynolds]] and future ''Three's Company'' co-star [[Norman Fell]]. Ritter made his film debut in the 1971 Disney film ''[[The Barefoot Executive]]''. He made guest appearances on the television series ''[[Hawaii Five-O (1968 TV series)|Hawaii Five-O]]'', ''[[M*A*S*H (TV series)|M*A*S*H]]'', and many others. He had a recurring role as the Reverend Matthew Fordwick on the drama series ''[[The Waltons]]'' from October 1972 to December 1976. Because he was not a weekly cast member, he had time to pursue other roles, which he did until December 1976, when he left for a starring role in the hit sitcom ''[[Three's Company]]'' (the Americanized version of the 1970s British [[Thames Television]] series ''[[Man About the House]]'') in 1977. In 1978, Ritter played [[Ringo Starr]]'s manager on the TV special ''[[Ringo (1978 film)|Ringo]]''. In 1982, Ritter provided the voice of Peter Dickinson in ''[[The Flight of Dragons]]''.\n\nRitter became a household name playing struggling culinary student [[Jack Tripper]] with two female roommates. Ritter co-starred opposite [[Joyce DeWitt]] and [[Suzanne Somers]], and then later [[Jenilee Harrison]] and [[Priscilla Barnes]]. Much of the comedy centered around Jack's pretending to be gay to keep the old-fashioned landlords appeased over the seemingly sordid living arrangements. The series spent several seasons near the top of the TV ratings in the U.S. before ending in 1984. A year-long spin-off ''[[Three's a Crowd]]'' ensued, as the Jack Tripper character has a live-in girlfriend and runs his own bistro. The original series has been seen continuously in reruns and is available on DVD. During the run of ''Three's Company'', Ritter appeared in the films ''[[Hero at Large]]'', ''[[Americathon]]'', and ''[[They All Laughed]]''. In 1986, he played the role of Dad in the music video for [[Graham Nash]]'s song \"Innocent Eyes\" from the [[Innocent Eyes (Graham Nash album)|album of the same name]].\n\n''[[Hooperman]]'' was Ritter's first regular television role after ''Three's Company''. Detective Harry Hooperman inherits a run-down apartment building and hires Susan Smith ([[Debrah Farentino]]) to run it. A relationship follows, and Hooperman must juggle work, love, and the antics of Bijoux the dog. In 1988, John was nominated for both an [[Emmy Award]]<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.emmys.com/celebrities/john-ritter |title=John Ritter Emmy Nominated |publisher=Emmys.com |date=September 12, 2003 |accessdate=December 12, 2014}}</ref> and a [[Golden Globe Award]] for his work on ''Hooperman''. Ritter won a [[People's Choice Awards|People's Choice Award]] for this role. From 1992 to 1995, Ritter returned to television for three seasons as John Hartman, aide to a U.S. Senator in ''[[Hearts Afire]]''. This series starred [[Markie Post]] as Georgie Anne Lahti and [[Billy Bob Thornton]] as Billy Bob Davis. He also played Garry Lejeune / Roger Tramplemain in the production ''Noises Off'' in 1992.\n\nAfter his time on television, he appeared in a number of movies, most notably ''[[Problem Child (film)|Problem Child]]'' and its [[Problem Child 2|first sequel]]. He played the lead role in [[Blake Edwards]]' 1989 film ''[[Skin Deep (1989 film)|Skin Deep]]'', appeared in the film version of ''[[Noises Off (film)|Noises Off]]'', rejoined Billy Bob Thornton in the [[Academy Awards|Oscar]]-winning ''[[Sling Blade]]'' (playing a kindhearted, gay, discount-store manager), and co-starred with [[Olivier Gruner]] in the 1996 action film ''Mercenary''. Ritter starred in many made-for-TV movies, including ''Gramps'' (1995), co-starring with [[Andy Griffith]], Rob Hedden's ''The Colony'' (1995) with [[Hal Linden]], [[Stephen King]]'s ''[[It (miniseries)|It]]'', ''Danielle Steel's Heartbeat'' with [[Polly Draper]], and ''[[It Came From the Sky (film)|It Came From the Sky]]'' in 1999 with [[Yasmine Bleeth]].\n\nRitter also made guest appearances on TV shows, such as ''[[Felicity (TV series)|Felicity]]'', ''[[Ally McBeal]],'' ''[[Scrubs (TV series)|Scrubs]],'' ''[[Buffy the Vampire Slayer (TV series)|Buffy the Vampire Slayer]]'', and an episode of ''[[Law & Order: SVU]]'' (2002). He also provided the voice of the [[Clifford (character)|title character]] in the animated children's show ''[[Clifford the Big Red Dog (TV series)|Clifford the Big Red Dog]]'', a role for which he received four [[Daytime Emmy Award|Emmy]] nominations. His final film was ''[[Stanley's Dinosaur Round-Up]]'' (2006), an animated direct-to-DVD film based on the television series, which was dedicated to his memory.\n\nAt the time of his death he was starring in ''[[8 Simple Rules|8 Simple Rules for Dating My Teenage Daughter]]''.\n\n===Theater===\nRitter played Claude Pichon in ''[[The Dinner Party (play)|The Dinner Party]]'' (2000) at the [[Music Box Theatre]] on [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]], which was written by [[Neil Simon]].

While still in college, Ritter traveled to the United Kingdom, the Netherlands, and West Germany to perform in plays. Ritter graduated in 1970.<ref name=lipton>{{cite magazine| last=Lipton| first=Michael A.| title=Acting His Age| url=http://www.people.com/people/article/0,,20138768,00.html| magazine=People| date=December 16, 2002| url-status=dead| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141107160642/http://www.people.com/people/article/0,,20138768,00.html| archivedate=November 7, 2014}}</ref>\n\n==Career==\n\n===Film and television===\n[[File:John Ritter 1977.jpg|thumb|Ritter as [[Jack Tripper]], 1977]]\nRitter headlined several stage performances. After his graduation from USC in 1970, his first TV acting experience was a campus revolutionary in the TV series ''[[Dan August]]'' starring [[Burt Reynolds]] and future ''Three's Company'' co-star [[Norman Fell]]. Ritter made his film debut in the 1971 Disney film ''[[The Barefoot Executive]]''. He made guest appearances on the television series ''[[Hawaii Five-O (1968 TV series)|Hawaii Five-O]]'', ''[[M*A*S*H (TV series)|M*A*S*H]]'', and many others. He had a recurring role as the Reverend Matthew Fordwick on the drama series ''[[The Waltons]]'' from October 1972 to December 1976. Because he was not a weekly cast member, he had time to pursue other roles, which he did until December 1976, when he left for a starring role in the hit sitcom ''[[Three's Company]]'' (the Americanized version of the 1970s British [[Thames Television]] series ''[[Man About the House]]'') in 1977. In 1978, Ritter played [[Ringo Starr]]'s manager on the TV special ''[[Ringo (1978 film)|Ringo]]''. In 1982, Ritter provided the voice of Peter Dickinson in ''[[The Flight of Dragons]]''.\n\nRitter became a household name playing struggling culinary student [[Jack Tripper]] with two female roommates. Ritter co-starred opposite [[Joyce DeWitt]] and [[Suzanne Somers]], and then later [[Jenilee Harrison]] and [[Priscilla Barnes]]. Much of the comedy centered around Jack's pretending to be gay to keep the old-fashioned landlords appeased over the seemingly sordid living arrangements. The series spent several seasons near the top of the TV ratings in the U.S. before ending in 1984. A year-long spin-off ''[[Three's a Crowd]]'' ensued, as the Jack Tripper character has a live-in girlfriend and runs his own bistro. The original series has been seen continuously in reruns and is available on DVD. During the run of ''Three's Company'', Ritter appeared in the films ''[[Hero at Large]]'', ''[[Americathon]]'', and ''[[They All Laughed]]''. In 1986, he played the role of Dad in the music video for [[Graham Nash]]'s song \"Innocent Eyes\" from the [[Innocent Eyes (Graham Nash album)|album of the same name]].\n\n''[[Hooperman]]'' was Ritter's first regular television role after ''Three's Company''. Detective Harry Hooperman inherits a run-down apartment building and hires Susan Smith ([[Debrah Farentino]]) to run it. A relationship follows, and Hooperman must juggle work, love, and the antics of Bijoux the dog. In 1988, John was nominated for both an [[Emmy Award]]<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.emmys.com/celebrities/john-ritter |title=John Ritter Emmy Nominated |publisher=Emmys.com |date=September 12, 2003 |accessdate=December 12, 2014}}</ref> and a [[Golden Globe Award]] for his work on ''Hooperman''. Ritter won a [[People's Choice Awards|People's Choice Award]] for this role. From 1992 to 1995, Ritter returned to television for three seasons as John Hartman, aide to a U.S. Senator in ''[[Hearts Afire]]''. This series starred [[Markie Post]] as Georgie Anne Lahti and [[Billy Bob Thornton]] as Billy Bob Davis. He also played Garry Lejeune / Roger Tramplemain in the production ''Noises Off'' in 1992.\n\nAfter his time on television, he appeared in a number of movies, most notably ''[[Problem Child (film)|Problem Child]]'' and its [[Problem Child 2|first sequel]]. He played the lead role in [[Blake Edwards]]' 1989 film ''[[Skin Deep (1989 film)|Skin Deep]]'', appeared in the film version of ''[[Noises Off (film)|Noises Off]]'', rejoined Billy Bob Thornton in the [[Academy Awards|Oscar]]-winning ''[[Sling Blade]]'' (playing a kindhearted, gay, discount-store manager), and co-starred with [[Olivier Gruner]] in the 1996 action film ''Mercenary''. Ritter starred in many made-for-TV movies, including ''Gramps'' (1995), co-starring with [[Andy Griffith]], Rob Hedden's ''The Colony'' (1995) with [[Hal Linden]], [[Stephen King]]'s ''[[It (miniseries)|It]]'', ''Danielle Steel's Heartbeat'' with [[Polly Draper]], and ''[[It Came From the Sky (film)|It Came From the Sky]]'' in 1999 with [[Yasmine Bleeth]].\n\nRitter also made guest appearances on TV shows, such as ''[[Felicity (TV series)|Felicity]]'', ''[[Ally McBeal]],'' ''[[Scrubs (TV series)|Scrubs]],'' ''[[Buffy the Vampire Slayer (TV series)|Buffy the Vampire Slayer]]'', and an episode of ''[[Law & Order: SVU]]'' (2002). He also provided the voice of the [[Clifford (character)|title character]] in the animated children's show ''[[Clifford the Big Red Dog (TV series)|Clifford the Big Red Dog]]'', a role for which he received four [[Daytime Emmy Award|Emmy]] nominations. His final film was ''[[Stanley's Dinosaur Round-Up]]'' (2006), an animated direct-to-DVD film based on the television series, which was dedicated to his memory.\n\nAt the time of his death he was starring in ''[[8 Simple Rules|8 Simple Rules for Dating My Teenage Daughter]]''.\n\n===Theater===\nRitter played Claude Pichon in ''[[The Dinner Party (play)|The Dinner Party]]'' (2000) at the [[Music Box Theatre]] on [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]], which was written by [[Neil Simon]].

Yasbeck worked with the [[University of Texas Health Science Center at Houston]] (UTHealth) to establish the John Ritter Research Program in Aortic and Vascular Diseases with the goal of preventing premature deaths due to aortic dissection by identifying genetic mutations that predispose individuals to thoracic aortic aneurysms and dissections.\n\n==Filmography==\n\n===Film===\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n!

The film features [[Jane Withers]] in her first starring role, and also stars [[O. P. Heggie]], [[Jackie Searl]], [[Katharine Alexander]], and [[Walter Woolf King]].\n \n==Plot==\nJeanette Tracy, known to her friends as Ginger, is an 8-year-old orphan living in a New York slum apartment with her \"Uncle Rex\", an aging Shakespearean actor. Their poor but happy existence is framed by lines from famous Shakespearean plays which they recite to each other; their favorite is the balcony scene from ''[[Romeo and Juliet]]''. One day a probation officer comes to the apartment and threatens to take Ginger away if she doesn't stop skipping school and Uncle Rex remains unemployed. Uncle Rex says he has found a job at the casting office and Ginger assures the officer that she will be a model student from now on. It turns out that Uncle Rex's new job is as a sidewalk hawker for a movie theater, and he is arrested when he attacks the manager who insults his Shakespearean acting. Unable to pay the $30 fine, he is sent to jail for 30 days.\n\nGinger steals small metal pieces from stores to pay the fine and is caught and brought before a judge. He suggests that the well-to-do Mrs. Parker, who is writing a book about child-raising called ''Are Children Human?'' take her into her own home. Mrs. Parker's son, Hamilton, is the product of her ideas: an effeminate, snobbish, harp-playing youth. The contrast between Hamilton and Ginger is stark, as Ginger is a tomboy, speaks slang, and lacks table manners. But Mr. Parker, who disapproves of his wife's child-raising ideas, takes a liking to Ginger and offers to bail out Uncle Rex. When he brings him home to pick up Ginger, Uncle Rex is so overwhelmed by the elegant house and the opportunities that wealth can afford for Ginger's future that he runs out on her. He is struck by a car and spends several months in a hospital with [[aphasia]]. \n\nAs the months pass, Ginger becomes more and more cultured while Hamilton becomes more streetwise. When they are taken out for a ride on [[Thanksgiving (United States)|Thanksgiving]] day, Ginger spots her old gang and Hamilton gets into a fight with an older boy who has taken Ginger's dog. Hamilton wins the fight. Back home, Ginger overhears Mrs. Parker reading from her book to her ladies' club, describing how uncouth Ginger was when she came to her and asserting that Uncle Rex isn't her real uncle at all, but a friend of her actor-parents.

The film features [[Jane Withers]] in her first starring role, and also stars [[O. P. Heggie]], [[Jackie Searl]], [[Katharine Alexander]], and [[Walter Woolf King]].\n \n==Plot==\nJeanette Tracy, known to her friends as Ginger, is an 8-year-old orphan living in a New York slum apartment with her \"Uncle Rex\", an aging Shakespearean actor. Their poor but happy existence is framed by lines from famous Shakespearean plays which they recite to each other; their favorite is the balcony scene from ''[[Romeo and Juliet]]''. One day a probation officer comes to the apartment and threatens to take Ginger away if she doesn't stop skipping school and Uncle Rex remains unemployed. Uncle Rex says he has found a job at the casting office and Ginger assures the officer that she will be a model student from now on. It turns out that Uncle Rex's new job is as a sidewalk hawker for a movie theater, and he is arrested when he attacks the manager who insults his Shakespearean acting. Unable to pay the $30 fine, he is sent to jail for 30 days.\n\nGinger steals small metal pieces from stores to pay the fine and is caught and brought before a judge. He suggests that the well-to-do Mrs. Parker, who is writing a book about child-raising called ''Are Children Human?'' take her into her own home. Mrs. Parker's son, Hamilton, is the product of her ideas: an effeminate, snobby, harp-playing youth. The contrast between Hamilton and Ginger is stark, as Ginger is a tomboy, speaks slang, and lacks table manners. But Mr. Parker, who disapproves of his wife's child-raising ideas, takes a liking to Ginger and offers to bail out Uncle Rex. When he brings him home to pick up Ginger, Uncle Rex is so overwhelmed by the elegant house and the opportunities that wealth can afford for Ginger's future that he runs out on her. He is struck by a car and spends several months in a hospital with [[aphasia]]. \n\nAs the months pass, Ginger becomes more and more cultured while Hamilton becomes more streetwise. When they are taken out for a ride on [[Thanksgiving (United States)|Thanksgiving]] day, Ginger spots her old gang and Hamilton gets into a fight with an older boy who has taken Ginger's dog. Hamilton wins the fight. Back home, Ginger overhears Mrs. Parker reading from her book to her ladies' club, describing how uncouth Ginger was when she came to her and asserting that Uncle Rex isn't her real uncle at all, but a friend of her actor-parents. Ginger becomes inconsolable and runs away with Hamilton back to her slum apartment. There they find Uncle Rex, who has found his way home. The Parkers join them there, having made up with one another after Mrs. Parker agrees to be more humanistic in her child-raising efforts.\n\n==Cast== \n*[[Jane Withers]] as Ginger\n*[[O. P.
