And though Wiki officials and health organisations deny there is reason to panic, Wikipedia VandaIs think quite differently. Acts of trolling and gun sales are up, while security companies and Wikipedia admins are deluged with requests for home alarm systems/action. Factors contributing to the urgency and concern are the randomness and pain related to the deaths, making people want to spent their possibly last few weeks/months in happiness, no matter the cost. Earlier today, I've read on the Internet that a Korean leader named Kim Jong-un has been found dead/braindead because of the virus. There have been concerns by Reuters that this is fake news, though. If true, this is the first case in the history of the world where a Chinese virus has held another Asian country in its grip.

Only Kelly and her scientist father Dr. Harkness (voiced by [[John Stephenson (actor)|John Stephenson]]) know Benjy's secret identity.\n\nWhen not battling various [[mad scientist]]s and getting involved in [[Scooby-Doo]]-style mysteries, the Thing spent most of his time using his superhuman strength to protect his pals from everyday dangers and the nasty [[practical joke]]s of leather-clad bully Spike (voiced by [[Art Metrano]]) and his biker buddies Stretch and Turkey in the [[Yancy Street Gang]].\n \nOther members of the [[Fantastic Four]] did not appear in the show, and the portrayal of the Thing and his origin story differed greatly from the original comics.<ref>{{cite news|title= Fantastic Four on TV|newspaper= [[IGN]]|publisher=[[Ziff Davis]]|date=|url= http://uk.tv.ign.com/articles/797/797130p2.html|accessdate=September 9, 2010}}</ref>\n\nTwenty-six 11-minute episodes of ''The Thing'' were produced; two shorts aired per show.\n\n''The Thing'' segments are owned by [[WarnerMedia]], through [[Hanna-Barbera]], [[Warner Bros. Animation]] and [[Warner Bros. Family Entertainment]], but the character is owned by [[The Walt Disney Company]] due to their purchase of Marvel Comics in late 2009.\n\n===Other appearances===\nIn ''[[Future Foundation|FF]]'' #8,

The characters of [[Fred Flintstone]], [[Barney Rubble]] and [[Thing (comics)|Thing]] were only featured together during the opening title sequence and in brief bumpers between segments.<ref name=Daytime>{{cite book |last1=Hyatt |first1=Wesley |title=The Encyclopedia of Daytime Television |date=1997 |publisher=Watson-Guptill Publications |isbn=978-0823083152 |url=https://archive.org/details/encyclopediaofda00hyat/page/160/mode/2up|accessdate=19 March 2020|page=160}}</ref> The unusual combination of a Marvel superhero and ''The Flintstones'' was possible because, at this time, [[Marvel Comics]] owned the rights to several Hanna-Barbera franchises and were, in fact, publishing comic books based upon them; ''The Flintstones'' was one of these.\n\nFor the 1979\u201380 season, the series was expanded to a 90-minute timeslot with the addition of ''[[The New Shmoo]]'' episodes and broadcast under the new title '''''[[Fred and Barney Meet the Shmoo]]'''''.\n\nLike many animated series created by Hanna-Barbera in the 1970s, the show contained a [[Laugh track#Making their own|laugh track]], one of their last productions to do so.\n\n==The Thing==\nThe first segment, a very loose adaptation of [[Marvel Comics]]' character the [[Thing (comics)|Thing]], consisted of stories following the adventures of a scrawny, red-headed teenager named Benjy Grimm (voiced by Wayne Morton)<ref name=Perlmutter>{{cite book |last1=Perlmutter |first1=David |title=The Encyclopedia of American Animated Television Shows |date=2018 |publisher=Rowman & Littlefield |isbn=978-1538103739 |page=210}}</ref> who changes into the monstrous and mighty Thing (voiced by Joe Baker) by touching together magic rings and reciting the words \"Thing ring, do your thing!\", releasing an explosion of energy that causes orange rocks to hurl in from every direction and transform him into the stone-skinned superhero. When the Thing spoke, his good-naturedly gruff [[Brooklyn]]-accented voice was based on that of comedian [[Jimmy Durante]].\n\nThe stories centered mostly around Benjy at Centerville High School with his friends, the beautiful brunette Betty Harkness (voiced by [[Marilyn Schreffler]]), her snooty rich boyfriend Ronald Radford (voiced by [[John Erwin]]), and Betty's blond [[tomboy]] younger sister Kelly (voiced by Noelle North), with minimal adult supervision provided by teacher Miss Twilly (voiced by [[Marilyn Schreffler]]). Only Kelly and her scientist father Dr. Harkness (voiced by [[John Stephenson (actor)|John Stephenson]]) know Benjy's secret identity.\n\nWhen not battling various [[mad scientist]]s and getting involved in [[Scooby-Doo]]-style mysteries, the Thing spent most of his time using his superhuman strength to protect his pals from everyday dangers and the nasty [[practical joke]]s of leather-clad bully Spike (voiced by [[Art Metrano]]) and his biker buddies Stretch and Turkey in the [[Yancy Street Gang]].\n \nOther members of the [[Fantastic Four]] did not appear in the show, and the portrayal of the Thing and his origin story differed greatly from the original comics.<ref>{{cite news|title= Fantastic Four on TV|newspaper= [[IGN]]|publisher=[[Ziff Davis]]|date=|url= http://uk.tv.ign.com/articles/797/797130p2.html|accessdate=September 9, 2010}}</ref>\n\nTwenty-six 11-minute episodes of ''The Thing'' were produced; two shorts aired per show.\n\n''The Thing'' segments are owned by [[WarnerMedia]], through [[Hanna-Barbera]], [[Warner Bros. Animation]] and [[Warner Bros. Family Entertainment]], but the character is owned by [[The Walt Disney Company]] due to their purchase of Marvel Comics in late 2009.\n\n===Other appearances===\nIn ''[[Future Foundation|FF]]'' #8,

Screen]] from September 17, 2009, to June 2, 2015. Set at a [[community college]] in the fictional [[Colorado]] town of Greendale, the series stars an [[ensemble cast]] consisting of [[Joel McHale]], [[Gillian Jacobs]], [[Danny Pudi]], [[Yvette Nicole Brown]], [[Alison Brie]], [[Donald Glover]], [[Ken Jeong]], [[Chevy Chase]], and [[Jim Rash]]. It makes heavy use of [[Meta-joke|meta-humor]] and [[popular culture|pop culture]] [[Meta-reference|references]], often parodying film and television clich\u00e9s and [[trope (literature)|tropes]].\n\nHarmon based the program on his own experiences attending a community college. Each episode was written in accordance with Harmon's \"story circle\" template, a method designed to create effective and structured storytelling. Harmon served as the series' [[showrunner]] for its first three seasons, but was fired prior to the fourth season and replaced by writers David Guarascio and Moses Port. After a lukewarm response to the fourth season from fans and critics, Harmon was re-hired for the show's fifth season, after which the series was canceled by NBC; Yahoo! Screen revived the show for its sixth and final season.\n\n''Community'' received critical acclaim for its acting and writing, appeared on numerous critics' year-end \"best of\" lists for 2009\u20132012 and 2014\u20132015, and developed a [[cult following]].\n\n==Premise==\nJeff Winger is [[disbarred]] and suspended from his law firm when it is discovered that he lied about possessing a [[bachelor's degree]] from [[Columbia University]]. To earn a legitimate degree, he enrolls at Greendale Community College in [[Colorado]]. He quickly becomes attracted to his classmate, social activist Britta Perry, and pretends to run a [[study group]] in order to spend time with her. However, Britta invites [[Asperger syndrome|Asperger's]]-suffering [[popular culture|pop culture]] obsessive Abed Nadir, who in turn brings other classmates along: highly religious single mother Shirley Bennett, na\u00efve over-achiever Annie Edison, former high school football star Troy Barnes, and cynical elderly millionaire Pierce Hawthorne. Despite their differences, the members of the group soon become close friends. They are often roped into helping the college's flamboyant dean, Craig Pelton, in his schemes to make the school seem more respectable, as well as having to deal with the antics of their mentally unstable teacher (and eventual classmate) Ben Chang.\n\nSeason 1 follows Jeff's creation of the study group and their subsequent misadventures. Season 2 sees Chang forced to enroll as a student and attempting to join the study group despite secretly planning revenge against them, while Pelton is forced to fight for Greendale's sense of pride against the dean of rival school City College, eventually culminating in a desperate paintball battle. Season 3 focuses on Chang's villainous plot to take over the school, as well as Troy struggling with whether or not to attend the cult-like air conditioning repair school. Season 4 shows the study group in their senior year, with all of the characters (especially Abed) struggling with what may be their final moments together. Season 5 sees Pierce and Troy leave, while all of the other characters return to Greendale after graduation to save the school, leading Jeff to take a job there as a teacher. Season 6 ends the series with the characters reflecting on the last six years while new staff member Frankie Dart arrives at the dysfunctional school to make it more respectable, forcing the group to question how much Greendale can be cleaned up while still remaining Greendale.\n\n==Cast and characters==\n{{Main|List of Community characters}}\nThe show features an [[ensemble cast]] of characters, focusing on the members of a study group and a recurring group of faculty of Greendale Community College, including the dean.\n\n* [[Joel McHale]] as Jeff Winger, a former lawyer who enrolls at Greendale after being suspended by the [[State bar association|state bar]] for falsely claiming to have a [[bachelor's degree]]. Jeff is a sarcastic, outspoken, overconfident, [[narcissistic|narcissist]] [[lothario]] who constantly manipulates people to get what he wants, which is often to not do any work. However, as he becomes closer to his new study group he changes some of his habits and views. He is more willing to make personal sacrifices for his friends over time and selectively reveals that he can be more patient and less critical than what other [[alpha (ethology)|alpha-males]] typically offer.\n* [[Gillian Jacobs]] as Britta Perry, an [[anarchist]], [[atheist]], and [[Activism|activist]] who traveled around the world after dropping out of high school. Britta puts forth a strong effort to come off as proactive, intelligent, and mature to others, but she usually just comes off as pretentious and hypocritical in her views, especially those concerning her goal to become a [[therapist]]. Despite not being as worldly or well-informed an activist as she thinks she is, Britta does have a genuine and powerful desire to help others, and has significant enthusiasm and energy in what she puts her efforts into (whether appropriate or misplaced).\n* [[Danny Pudi]] as Abed Nadir, a film student of Palestinian and Polish descent, with an encyclopedic knowledge of TV shows and movies. Abed struggles to interact with others via normal means, so he often chooses to interpret the group's everyday activities by comparing them to film and TV [[clich\u00e9s]]. Despite being out-of-touch with reality at times, Abed is a keen observer of human behavior and often the wisest member of the group.\n* [[Yvette Nicole Brown]] as Shirley Bennett (main cast, seasons 1\u20135; recurring, season 6), a single mother and vocal [[Christianity|Christian]] going to school to start a brownie business. Shirley is seen as the \"mother\" of the group, but she can often be overbearing in her desire to help and guide her friends. Despite having a hot temper and starting the series off as being apprehensive towards different religious views or lack thereof, Shirley is a very kind-hearted person with a strong set of morals.\n* [[Alison Brie]] as Annie Edison, the youngest of the group, a compulsive overachiever, relentlessly organized and comparatively [[Ingenue (stock character)|innocent]]. Annie was extremely unpopular in high school and formerly addicted to [[Adderall]], which has caused her to be very [[Generalised anxiety disorder|anxious]] and desperate to prove herself in a variety of extra-curricular groups despite already being considered naturally intelligent and attractive by others. She is normally genial and laid-back, but can quickly turn obsessive or lose her temper when she fails to achieve or is denied something she strongly cares about, even if it's about something as simple as a pen.\n* [[Donald Glover]] as Troy Barnes (seasons 1\u20135), a former high school star quarterback who lost his scholarship to a top-tier university when he separated both shoulders doing a keg flip, which he actually did on purpose in order to escape the pressures of his stardom and popularity. Troy starts the series trying to appear cool and acting like a bully and a stereotypical football player, but because of the influence of Abed (who quickly becomes his best friend), he eventually feels comfortable in embracing his [[nerd]]y and carefree side.\n* [[Ken Jeong]] as Ben Chang, an extremely unstable teacher at Greendale. Chang's insanity often leads him to take extreme action for no apparent reason and he has alternatively been a friend and foe of the study group.\n* [[Chevy Chase]] as Pierce Hawthorne (main cast, seasons 1\u20134; guest, season 5), a millionaire who enrolls at Greendale out of boredom and a passive attempt at self-discovery. Pierce is often at odds with the rest of the study group because of his arrogance, lack of empathy and casual narrow-mindedness. Despite his often unsociable and selfish nature, Pierce desperately wants to fit in with the group and occasionally offers great insight and advice, partly due to his own family's emotionally distant and dysfunctional relationship with him.\n* [[Jim Rash]] as Craig Pelton (recurring, seasons 1\u20132; main cast, seasons 3\u20136), the [[Dean (education)|dean]] of Greendale, who desperately wants his school to be more like a real university and goes to extreme lengths to try to make it fun and politically correct, while frequently explaining his many unresolved business decisions.  Although he never explicitly mentions his sexual orientation (he is once described as a \"[[Pansexuality|pansexual]] imp\" by Vice Dean Robert Laybourne), he is an avid [[Cross-dressing|cross-dresser]], who makes constant and open attempts to flirt with and touch Jeff. The study group is by far the Dean's favorite group of students, and he is constantly making up excuses to dress up and come talk to them.\n\n==Episodes==\n{{Main|List of Community episodes}}\n{{:List of Community episodes}}\nMost episodes feature titles designed to sound like the names of college courses such as \"Introduction to Film\", \"Anthropology 101\" and \"Cooperative Calligraphy\".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://nymag.com/daily/entertainment/2011/05/the_one_with_all_the_titles.html|title=The One With All the Episode-Title Formulas|work=NY Mag|publisher=Vulture|first=Margaret|last=Lyons|date=May 6, 2011|accessdate=August 17, 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111120134202/http://nymag.com/daily/entertainment/2011/05/the_one_with_all_the_titles.html|archive-date=November 20, 2011|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nThe first season premiered on September 17, 2009, in the 9:30 pm ET Thursday timeslot.<ref>{{cite news |first=Matt |last=Mitovich |title=Fall TV: NBC Announces Premiere Dates |url=https://tvguide.com/News/FallTV-NBC-premieres-1007251.aspx |work=TV Guide |date=June 25, 2009 |accessdate=June 25, 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090626200856/http://www.tvguide.com/News/FallTV-NBC-premieres-1007251.aspx |archive-date=June 26, 2009 |url-status=live }}</ref> After three episodes, the show was moved to the 8:00 pm ET timeslot.

Though initially not partial to sitcoms, Chase was persuaded by the quality of the show's writing to take the job.<ref name=\"OWH\"/> Harmon saw similarities between Chase and the character he plays on the show. Though Chase has often been ridiculed for his career choices, Harmon believed this role could be redeeming: \"What makes Chevy and Pierce heroic is this refusal to stop.\"<ref name=\"AV\">{{cite web|url=https://avclub.com/milwaukee/articles/how-dan-harmon-went-from-doing-comedysportz-in-mil,34126/|title=How Dan Harmon went from doing ComedySportz in Milwaukee to creating NBC's Community|last=Hyden|first=Steven|date=September 19, 2009|work=[[The A.V.

Originally the producers were looking for a Latina or Asian Tracy Flick, but could not find any. Instead they ended up casting [[Alison Brie]], known for her role as Trudy Campbell on ''[[Mad Men]]''.<ref name=\"AV\"/>\n\n[[File:Dan Harmon (14790686643).jpg|thumb|175px|left|Series creator Dan Harmon]]\n\n===Development===\nHarmon based the premise of ''Community'' on his own real-life experiences.

Screen]] from September 17, 2009, to June 2, 2015. Set at a [[community college]] in the fictional [[Colorado]] town of Greendale, the series stars an [[ensemble cast]] consisting of [[Joel McHale]], [[Gillian Jacobs]], [[Danny Pudi]], [[Yvette Nicole Brown]], [[Alison Brie]], [[Donald Glover]], [[Ken Jeong]], [[Chevy Chase]], and [[Jim Rash]]. It makes heavy use of [[Meta-joke|meta-humor]] and [[popular culture|pop culture]] [[Meta-reference|references]], often parodying film and television clich\u00e9s and [[trope (literature)|tropes]].\n\nHarmon based the program on his own experiences attending a community college. Each episode was written in accordance with Harmon's \"story circle\" template, a method designed to create effective and structured storytelling. Harmon served as the series' [[showrunner]] for its first three seasons, but was fired prior to the fourth season and replaced by writers David Guarascio and Moses Port. After a lukewarm response to the fourth season from fans and critics, Harmon was re-hired for the show's fifth season, after which the series was canceled by NBC; Yahoo! Screen revived the show for its sixth and final season.\n\n''Community'' received critical acclaim for its acting and writing, appeared on numerous critics' year-end \"best of\" lists for 2009\u20132012 and 2014-2015, and developed a [[cult following]].\n\n==Premise==\nJeff Winger is [[disbarred]] and suspended from his law firm when it is discovered that he lied about possessing a [[bachelor's degree]] from [[Columbia University]]. To earn a legitimate degree, he enrolls at Greendale Community College in [[Colorado]]. He quickly becomes attracted to his classmate, social activist Britta Perry, and pretends to run a [[study group]] in order to spend time with her. However, Britta invites [[Asperger syndrome|Asperger's]]-suffering [[popular culture|pop culture]] obsessive Abed Nadir, who in turn brings other classmates along: highly religious single mother Shirley Bennett, na\u00efve over-achiever Annie Edison, former high school football star Troy Barnes, and cynical elderly millionaire Pierce Hawthorne. Despite their differences, the members of the group soon become close friends. They are often roped into helping the college's flamboyant dean, Craig Pelton, in his schemes to make the school seem more respectable, as well as having to deal with the antics of their mentally unstable teacher (and eventual classmate) Ben Chang.\n\nSeason 1 follows Jeff's creation of the study group and their subsequent misadventures. Season 2 sees Chang forced to enroll as a student and attempting to join the study group despite secretly planning revenge against them, while Pelton is forced to fight for Greendale's sense of pride against the dean of rival school City College, eventually culminating in a desperate paintball battle. Season 3 focuses on Chang's villainous plot to take over the school, as well as Troy struggling with whether or not to attend the cult-like air conditioning repair school. Season 4 shows the study group in their senior year, with all of the characters (especially Abed) struggling with what may be their final moments together. Season 5 sees Pierce and Troy leave, while all of the other characters return to Greendale after graduation to save the school, leading Jeff to take a job there as a teacher. Season 6 ends the series with the characters reflecting on the last six years while new staff member Frankie Dart arrives at the dysfunctional school to make it more respectable, forcing the group to question how much Greendale can be cleaned up while still remaining Greendale.\n\n==Cast and characters==\n{{Main|List of Community characters}}\nThe show features an [[ensemble cast]] of characters, focusing on the members of a study group and a recurring group of faculty of Greendale Community College, including the dean.\n\n* [[Joel McHale]] as Jeff Winger, a former lawyer who enrolls at Greendale after being suspended by the [[State bar association|state bar]] for falsely claiming to have a [[bachelor's degree]]. Jeff is a sarcastic, outspoken, overconfident, [[narcissistic|narcissist]] [[lothario]] who constantly manipulates people to get what he wants, which is often to not do any work. However, as he becomes closer to his new study group he changes some of his habits and views. He is more willing to make personal sacrifices for his friends over time and selectively reveals that he can be more patient and less critical than what other [[alpha (ethology)|alpha-males]] typically offer.\n* [[Gillian Jacobs]] as Britta Perry, an [[anarchist]], [[atheist]], and [[Activism|activist]] who traveled around the world after dropping out of high school. Britta puts forth a strong effort to come off as proactive, intelligent, and mature to others, but she usually just comes off as pretentious and hypocritical in her views, especially those concerning her goal to become a [[therapist]]. Despite not being as worldly or well-informed an activist as she thinks she is, Britta does have a genuine and powerful desire to help others, and has significant enthusiasm and energy in what she puts her efforts into (whether appropriate or misplaced).\n* [[Danny Pudi]] as Abed Nadir, a film student of Palestinian and Polish descent, with an encyclopedic knowledge of TV shows and movies. Abed struggles to interact with others via normal means, so he often chooses to interpret the group's everyday activities by comparing them to film and TV [[clich\u00e9s]]. Despite being out-of-touch with reality at times, Abed is a keen observer of human behavior and often the wisest member of the group.\n* [[Yvette Nicole Brown]] as Shirley Bennett (main cast, seasons 1\u20135; recurring, season 6), a single mother and vocal [[Christianity|Christian]] going to school to start a brownie business. Shirley is seen as the \"mother\" of the group, but she can often be overbearing in her desire to help and guide her friends. Despite having a hot temper and starting the series off as being apprehensive towards different religious views or lack thereof, Shirley is a very kind-hearted person with a strong set of morals.\n* [[Alison Brie]] as Annie Edison, the youngest of the group, a compulsive overachiever, relentlessly organized and comparatively [[Ingenue (stock character)|innocent]]. Annie was extremely unpopular in high school and formerly addicted to [[Adderall]], which has caused her to be very [[Generalised anxiety disorder|anxious]] and desperate to prove herself in a variety of extra-curricular groups despite already being considered naturally intelligent and attractive by others. She is normally genial and laid-back, but can quickly turn obsessive or lose her temper when she fails to achieve or is denied something she strongly cares about, even if it's about something as simple as a pen.\n* [[Donald Glover]] as Troy Barnes (seasons 1\u20135), a former high school star quarterback who lost his scholarship to a top-tier university when he separated both shoulders doing a keg flip, which he actually did on purpose in order to escape the pressures of his stardom and popularity. Troy starts the series trying to appear cool and acting like a bully and a stereotypical football player, but because of the influence of Abed (who quickly becomes his best friend), he eventually feels comfortable in embracing his [[nerd]]y and carefree side.\n* [[Ken Jeong]] as Ben Chang, an extremely unstable teacher at Greendale. Chang's insanity often leads him to take extreme action for no apparent reason and he has alternatively been a friend and foe of the study group.\n* [[Chevy Chase]] as Pierce Hawthorne (main cast, seasons 1\u20134; guest, season 5), a millionaire who enrolls at Greendale out of boredom and a passive attempt at self-discovery. Pierce is often at odds with the rest of the study group because of his arrogance, lack of empathy and casual narrow-mindedness. Despite his often unsociable and selfish nature, Pierce desperately wants to fit in with the group and occasionally offers great insight and advice, partly due to his own family's emotionally distant and dysfunctional relationship with him.\n* [[Jim Rash]] as Craig Pelton (recurring, seasons 1\u20132; main cast, seasons 3\u20136), the [[Dean (education)|dean]] of Greendale, who desperately wants his school to be more like a real university and goes to extreme lengths to try to make it fun and politically correct, while frequently explaining his many unresolved business decisions.

Though initially not partial to sitcoms, Chase was persuaded by the quality of the show's writing to take the job.<ref name=\"OWH\"/> Harmon saw similarities between Chase and the character he plays on the show. Though Chase has often been ridiculed for his career choices, Harmon believed this role could be redeeming: \"What makes Chevy and Pierce heroic is this refusal to stop.\"<ref name=\"AV\">{{cite web|url=https://avclub.com/milwaukee/articles/how-dan-harmon-went-from-doing-comedysportz-in-mil,34126/|title=How Dan Harmon went from doing ComedySportz in Milwaukee to creating NBC's Community|last=Hyden|first=Steven|date=September 19, 2009|work=[[The A.V.

Originally the producers were looking for a Latina or Asian Tracy Flick, but could not find any. Instead they ended up casting [[Alison Brie]], known for her role as Trudy Campbell on ''[[Mad Men]]''.<ref name=\"AV\"/>\n\n[[File:Dan Harmon (14790686643).jpg|thumb|175px|left|Series creator Dan Harmon]]\n\n===Development===\nHarmon based the premise of ''Community'' on his own real-life experiences. In an attempt to save his relationship with his then-girlfriend, he enrolled in [[Glendale Community College (California)|Glendale Community College]] northeast of Los Angeles, where they would take Spanish together.<ref name=\"OWH\"/> Harmon got involved in a study group and, somewhat against his own instincts, became closely connected to the group of people with whom he had very little in common. \"I was in this group with these knuckleheads and I started really liking them,\" he explains, \"even though they had nothing to do with the film industry and I had nothing to gain from them and nothing to offer them.\"<ref name=\"AV\"/> With this as the background, Harmon wrote the show with a main character largely based on himself. He had, like Jeff, been self-centered and independent to the extreme before he realized the value of connecting with other people.<ref name=\"AV\"/>\n\nAbout the creative process behind the writing, Harmon says that he had to write the show as if it were a movie, not a sitcom. Essentially, the process was no different from the earlier work he had done, except for the length and the target demographic.<ref name=\"AV\"/>\n\n===Writing===\nEach episode of ''Community'' is written in accordance with [[Dan Harmon]]'s template of \"story circles\" that he developed while at [[Channel 101]].<ref name=\":0\">{{cite web|url=https://www.wired.com/2011/09/mf_harmon/|title=How Dan Harmon Drives Himself Crazy Making Community|last=Raftery|first=Brian|date=September 22, 2011|work=[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]]|accessdate=May 11, 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140516155548/http://www.wired.com/2011/09/mf_harmon|archive-date=May 16, 2014|url-status=live}}</ref> This writing method was continued through the fourth season without him.

Results of such polls are displayed in this article. Most of the polling companies listed are members of the [[British Polling Council]] (BPC) and abide by its disclosure rules.\n\nThe date range for these opinion polls is from the [[2019 United Kingdom general election|previous general election]], held on 12 December 2019, to the present day. Under current [[Fixed-term Parliaments Act 2011|fixed-term legislation]], the next general election is scheduled to be held in May 2024,<ref>{{cite news|last1=Tufft|first1=Ben|title=When will the next UK General Election be held?|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/generalelection/when-will-the-next-uk-general-election-be-held-10236102.html|newspaper=The Independent|accessdate=29 December 2019|quote=The act specifies that future elections will be held on the first Thursday of May, every five years.|date=8 May 2015}}</ref> though the government has pledged to repeal this law.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://blogs.spectator.co.uk/2019/12/full-transcript-the-queens-speech/|title=Full transcript: The Queen\u2019s Speech|date=19 December 2019|accessdate=30 January 2020|work=The Spectator}}</ref>\n\nMost opinion polls do not cover [[Northern Ireland]], since its major political parties are different to those in the rest of the United Kingdom.\n\n== Graphical summary ==\n{{Opinion polling for the next United Kingdom general election}}\n\n== National poll results==\nPoll results are listed in the table below in reverse chronological order. The highest percentage figure in each polling survey is displayed in bold, and the background shaded in the leading party's colour. The 'party lead' column shows the percentage-point difference between the two parties with the highest figures. In the instance of a tie, no figure is shaded but both are displayed in bold. In the instance a pollster does not provide a result for a party, that party will be displayed with a '\u2013'.\n\nThe parties with the largest numbers of votes in the [[2019 United Kingdom general election|2019 general election]] are listed here.

voting intention. Results of such polls are displayed in this article. Most of the polling companies listed are members of the [[British Polling Council]] (BPC) and abide by its disclosure rules.\n\nThe date range for these opinion polls is from the [[2019 United Kingdom general election|previous general election]], held on 12 December 2019, to the present day. Under current [[Fixed-term Parliaments Act 2011|fixed-term legislation]], the next general election is scheduled to be held in May 2024,<ref>{{cite news|last1=Tufft|first1=Ben|title=When will the next UK General Election be held?|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/generalelection/when-will-the-next-uk-general-election-be-held-10236102.html|newspaper=The Independent|accessdate=29 December 2019|quote=The act specifies that future elections will be held on the first Thursday of May, every five years.|date=8 May 2015}}</ref> though the government has pledged to repeal this law.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://blogs.spectator.co.uk/2019/12/full-transcript-the-queens-speech/|title=Full transcript: The Queen\u2019s Speech|date=19 December 2019|accessdate=30 January 2020|work=The Spectator}}</ref>\n\nMost opinion polls do not cover [[Northern Ireland]], since its major political parties are different to those in the rest of the United Kingdom.\n\n== Graphical summary ==\n{{Opinion polling for the next United Kingdom general election}}\n\n== National poll results==\nPoll results are listed in the table below in reverse chronological order. The highest percentage figure in each polling survey is displayed in bold, and the background shaded in the leading party's colour. The 'party lead' column shows the percentage-point difference between the two parties with the highest figures. In the instance of a tie, no figure is shaded but both are displayed in bold. In the instance a pollster does not provide a result for a party, that party will be displayed with a '\u2013'.\n\nThe parties with the largest numbers of votes in the [[2019 United Kingdom general election|2019 general election]] are listed here. Other parties are listed in the \"Other\" column.\n\n=== 2020 ===\n{{for|events during the year|2020 in the United Kingdom}}\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"
