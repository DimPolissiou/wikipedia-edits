A classical example of time slip is [[Mark Twain]]'s ''[[A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court]]'' (19th century), which had considerable influence on later writers.<ref name=\"JamesMendlesohn2012\">{{cite book|author1=Edward James|author2=Farah Mendlesohn|title=The Cambridge Companion to Fantasy Literature|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zWzlAgAAQBAJ&pg=PA106|date=26 January 2012|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-1-107-49373-5|pages=106\u2013}}</ref>\n\nOther kinds of accidental travel include [[Spacefaring|space travel]] (e.g., through accidental [[wormhole]]s, portals ([[portal fantasy]]) or other spatial irregularities, or a catastrophic spatial event), travel to an [[Interdimensional travel|alternative universe]], an [[Role-playing game|RPG]] universe ([[litRPG]]), or into an [[alternative history]].<ref name=bone/> An early example of catastrophic space travel is ''[[Hector Servadac]]'' (1877) by Jules Verne, where a piece of the Earth  with several [[Earthling]]s is ripped off by a comet. In ''Les Robinsons du Cosmos'' (''{{ill|The Robinsons of the Cosmos|ru|\u0420\u043e\u0431\u0438\u043d\u0437\u043e\u043d\u044b \u043a\u043e\u0441\u043c\u043e\u0441\u0430}}'') (1955) by [[Francis Carsac]], pieces of France and the US with plenty of population are ripped off and planted on an alien planet during a galactic collision. In 1912 [[Edgar Rice Burroughs]] invented [[John Carter of Mars]], who lands on Mars from a sacred cave where he was hiding from the Apaches.\n\nStill another way to land somewhere is to be [[alien abduction|abducted/invited by aliens]] to live in an advanced star-faring civilization. Common cliches include becoming a slave, or a warrior, or a dying person getting a second chance, with the subsequent social advance.\n\nA particular kind of effortless accidental travel is finding oneself elsewhere/elsewhen occupying someone's else mind, via [[body swap]] (mind swap) or mind/[[body sharing]].<ref name=bone/> Carsac wrote the story with the trick of this type as well: in ''Terre en fuite'' (1960) a scientist hit by lightning suddenly becomes a genius and before his death he reveals that his mind melded with the mind of a scientist from far future. However most of the novel is the description of the future of the Earth expecting the Sun to turn [[supernova]].\n\n==In Russian fiction==\n\nAround the break of the millennium ''popadantsy'' gained an immense popularity in [[Russian science fiction and fantasy]].

In ''Les Robinsons du Cosmos'' (''{{ill|The Robinsons of the Cosmos|ru|\u0420\u043e\u0431\u0438\u043d\u0437\u043e\u043d\u044b \u043a\u043e\u0441\u043c\u043e\u0441\u0430}}'') (1955) by [[Francis Carsac]], pieces of France and the US with plenty of population are ripped off and planted on an alien planet during a galactic collision. In 1912 [[Edgar Rice Burroughs]] invented [[John Carter of Mars]], who lands on Mars from a sacred cave where he was hiding from the Apaches.\n\nStill another way to land somewhere is to be [[alien abduction|abducted/invited by aliens]] to live in an advanced star-faring civilization. Common cliches include becoming a slave, or a warrior, or a dying person getting a second chance, with the subsequent social advance.\n\nA particular kind of effortless accidental travel is finding oneself elsewhere/elsewhen occupying someone's else mind, via [[body swap]] (mind swap) or mind/[[body sharing]].<ref name=bone/> Carsac wrote the story with the trick of this type as well: in ''Terre en fuite'' (1960) a scientist hit by lightning suddenly becomes a genius and before his death he reveals that his mind melded with the mind of a scientist from far future.

Apple [[fruit tree|trees]] are [[agriculture|cultivated]] worldwide and are the most widely grown species in the [[genus]] ''[[Malus]]''. The tree originated in [[Central Asia]], where its wild ancestor, ''[[Malus sieversii]]'', is still found today. Apples have been grown for thousands of years in [[Asia]] and [[Europe]] and were brought to North America by [[European colonization of the Americas|European colonists]]. Apples have religious and [[mythology|mythological]] significance in many cultures, including [[Norse mythology|Norse]], [[Greek mythology|Greek]] and [[Christianity in Europe|European Christian]] tradition.\n\nApple trees are large if grown from seed.  Generally, apple [[cultivar]]s are propagated by [[grafting]] onto [[rootstock]]s, which control the size of the resulting tree. There are more than 7,500 known [[List of apple cultivars|cultivars of apples]], resulting in a range of desired characteristics. Different cultivars are bred for various tastes and use, including [[cooking apple|cooking]], eating raw and [[apple cider|cider]] production. Trees and fruit are prone to a number of [[fungus|fungal]], bacterial and pest problems, which can be controlled by a number of [[organic farming|organic]] and non-organic means. In 2010, the fruit's [[genome]] was [[DNA sequencing|sequenced]] as part of research on disease control and selective breeding in apple production.\n\nWorldwide production of apples in 2017 was 83.1&nbsp;million [[tonnes]], with China accounting for half of the total.<ref name=faostat/>\n\n==Etymology==\n\nThe word \"apple\", formerly spelled ''\u00e6ppel'' in [[Old English]], is derived from the [[Proto-Germanic]] root *ap(a)laz, which could also mean [[fruit]] in general. This is ultimately derived from [[Proto-Indo-European]] *ab(e)l-, but the precise original meaning and the relationship between both words is uncertain.\n\nAs late as the 17th century, the word also functioned as a generic term for all fruit other than [[berries]] but including [[nut (fruit)|nut]]s\u2014such as the 14th century [[Middle English]] word ''appel of paradis'', meaning a [[banana]].<ref>{{cite web |title=Origin and meaning of \"apple\" by Online Etymology Dictionary |url=https://www.etymonline.com/word/apple |website=Online Etymology Dictionary |accessdate=22 November 2019 |url-status=live}}</ref> This use is analogous to the [[French language]] use of ''pomme''.\n\n==Description==\n\n[[File:Koeh-108.jpg|thumb|right|Blossoms, fruits, and leaves of the apple tree (''Malus domestica'')]]\n[[File:Pink lady and cross section.jpg|thumb|right|An apple's side, stem end, and interior]]\nThe apple is a [[deciduous]] tree, generally standing {{convert|6|to|15|ft|m|abbr=on}} tall in cultivation and up to {{convert|30|ft|m|abbr=on}} in the wild.<!--<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.treenames.net/ti/malus/index_apple_tree.html |title=Types and names of Apple Trees, Species of the Malus Genus |publisher=Treenames.net |accessdate=25 August 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140915015547/http://www.treenames.net/ti/malus/index_apple_tree.html |archive-date=15 September 2014 |url-status=live }}</ref>--> When cultivated, the size, shape and branch density are determined by [[rootstock]] selection and trimming method.

Some consumers, especially those in Japan, prefer a larger apple, while apples below {{convert|2+1/4|in|cm|abbr=on}} are generally used for making juice and have little fresh market value.

English scholar [[H. R. Ellis Davidson]] links apples to religious practices in [[Germanic paganism]], from which [[Norse paganism]] developed. She points out that buckets of apples were found in the [[Oseberg ship]] burial site in Norway, that fruit and nuts (I\u00f0unn having been described as being transformed into a nut in ''[[Sk\u00e1ldskaparm\u00e1l]]'') have been found in the early graves of the [[Germanic peoples]] in England and elsewhere on the continent of Europe, which may have had a symbolic meaning, and that nuts are still a recognized symbol of [[fertility]] in southwest England.<ref name=\"autogenerated1\"/>\n\nDavidson notes a connection between apples and the [[Vanir]], a tribe of gods associated with [[fertility]] in Norse mythology, citing an instance of eleven \"golden apples\" being given to woo the beautiful [[Ger\u00f0r]] by [[Sk\u00edrnir]], who was acting as messenger for the major Vanir god [[Freyr]] in stanzas 19 and 20 of ''[[Sk\u00edrnism\u00e1l]]''. Davidson also notes a further connection between fertility and apples in Norse mythology in chapter 2 of the ''[[V\u00f6lsunga saga]]'' when the major goddess [[Frigg]] sends King [[Rerir]] an apple after he prays to Odin for a child, Frigg's messenger (in the guise of a crow) drops the apple in his lap as he sits atop a [[tumulus|mound]].<ref name=\"DAVIDSON165-166\"/> Rerir's wife's consumption of the apple results in a six-year pregnancy and the [[Caesarean section]] birth of their son\u2014the hero [[V\u00f6lsung]].<ref name=\"DAVIDSONROLES146-147\"/>\n\nFurther, Davidson points out the \"strange\" phrase \"Apples of [[Hel (location)|Hel]]\" used in an 11th-century poem by the [[skald]] Thorbiorn Br\u00fanarson. She states this may imply that the apple was thought of by Br\u00fanarson as the food of the dead. Further, Davidson notes that the potentially Germanic goddess [[Nehalennia]] is sometimes depicted with apples and that parallels exist in early Irish stories. Davidson asserts that while cultivation of the apple in Northern Europe extends back to at least the time of the [[Roman Empire]] and came to Europe from the [[Near East]], the native varieties of apple trees growing in Northern Europe are small and bitter. Davidson concludes that in the figure of I\u00f0unn \"we must have a dim reflection of an old symbol: that of the guardian goddess of the life-giving fruit of the other world.\"<ref name=\"autogenerated1\" />\n\n===Greek mythology===\n[[File:Hercules Musei Capitolini MC1265 n2.jpg|thumb|right|upright=0.6|[[Heracles]] with the apple of [[Hesperides]]]]\nApples appear in many [[World religions|religious traditions]], often as a mystical or [[forbidden fruit]].

Five species of aphids commonly attack apples: apple grain aphid, rosy apple aphid, apple aphid, spirea aphid, and the woolly apple aphid. The aphid species can be identified by color, time of year, and by differences in the cornicles (small paired projections from their rear).<ref name=pest4/> Aphids feed on foliage using needle-like mouth parts to suck out plant juices.

Apples can be canned, dried or frozen.<ref name=applefood/> Canned or frozen apples are eventually baked into pies or other cooked dishes. Apple juice or cider is also bottled. Apple juice is often concentrated and frozen.\n\n===Popular uses===\nApples are often eaten raw. Cultivars bred for raw consumption are termed dessert or [[table apple]]s.\n* In the UK, a [[toffee apple]] is a traditional confection made by coating an apple in hot [[toffee]] and allowing it to cool. Similar treats in the U.S. are [[candy apple]]s (coated in a hard shell of crystallized sugar syrup) and [[caramel apples]] (coated with cooled [[caramel]]).\n* Apples are eaten with honey at the Jewish New Year of [[Rosh Hashanah]] to symbolize a sweet new year.<ref name=food/>\n\nApples are an important ingredient in many desserts, such as [[apple pie]], apple [[crumble]], [[apple crisp]] and [[apple cake]]. When cooked, some apple cultivars easily form a puree known as [[apple sauce]]. Apples are also made into [[apple butter]] and apple jelly. They are often [[baked]] or [[stewed]] and are also (cooked) in some meat dishes. Dried apples can be eaten or reconstituted (soaked in water, alcohol or some other liquid).\n\nApples are milled or pressed to produce [[apple juice]], which may be drunk unfiltered (called [[apple cider]] in North America), or filtered. Filtered juice is often concentrated and frozen, then reconstituted later and consumed. Apple juice can be [[fermentation (food)|fermented]] to make [[cider]] (called hard cider in North America), [[ciderkin]], and vinegar. Through [[distillation]], various alcoholic beverages can be produced, such as [[applejack (beverage)|applejack]], [[Calvados (spirit)|Calvados]], and [[apfelwein]].<ref>{{Cite book|title=Edible Medicinal And Non-Medicinal Plants: Volume 4, Fruits|isbn=9789400740532|location=|pages=|last1=Lim|first1=T.

Apples have religious and [[mythology|mythological]] significance in many cultures, including [[Norse mythology|Norse]], [[Greek mythology|Greek]] and [[Christianity in Europe|European Christian]] tradition.\n\nApple trees are large if grown from seed.  Generally, apple [[cultivar]]s are propagated by [[grafting]] onto [[rootstock]]s, which control the size of the resulting tree. There are more than 7,500 known [[List of apple cultivars|cultivars of apples]], resulting in a range of desired characteristics. Different cultivars are bred for various tastes and use, including [[cooking apple|cooking]], eating raw and [[apple cider|cider]] production. Trees and fruit are prone to a number of [[fungus|fungal]], bacterial and pest problems, which can be controlled by a number of [[organic farming|organic]] and non-organic means. In 2010, the fruit's [[genome]] was [[DNA sequencing|sequenced]] as part of research on disease control and selective breeding in apple production.\n\nWorldwide production of apples in 2017 was 83.1&nbsp;million [[tonnes]], with China accounting for half of the total.<ref name=faostat/>\n\n==Etymology==\n\nThe word \"apple\", formerly spelled ''\u00e6ppel'' in [[Old English]], is derived from the [[Proto-Germanic]] root *ap(a)laz, which could also mean [[fruit]] in general. This is ultimately derived from [[Proto-Indo-European]] *ab(e)l-, but the precise original meaning and the relationship between both words is uncertain.\n\nAs late as the 17th century, the word also functioned as a generic term for all fruit other than [[berries]] but including [[nut (fruit)|nut]]s\u2014such as the 14th century [[Middle English]] word ''appel of paradis'', meaning a [[banana]].<ref>{{cite web |title=Origin and meaning of \"apple\" by Online Etymology Dictionary |url=https://www.etymonline.com/word/apple |website=Online Etymology Dictionary |accessdate=22 November 2019 |url-status=live}}</ref> This use is analogous to the [[French language]] use of ''pomme''.\n\n==Description==\n\n[[File:Koeh-108.jpg|thumb|right|Blossoms, fruits, and leaves of the apple tree (''Malus domestica'')]]\n[[File:Pink lady and cross section.jpg|thumb|right|An apple's side, stem end, and interior]]\nThe apple is a [[deciduous]] tree, generally standing {{convert|6|to|15|ft|m|abbr=on}} tall in cultivation and up to {{convert|30|ft|m|abbr=on}} in the wild.<!--<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.treenames.net/ti/malus/index_apple_tree.html |title=Types and names of Apple Trees, Species of the Malus Genus |publisher=Treenames.net |accessdate=25 August 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140915015547/http://www.treenames.net/ti/malus/index_apple_tree.html |archive-date=15 September 2014 |url-status=live }}</ref>--> When cultivated, the size, shape and branch density are determined by [[rootstock]] selection and trimming method.

English scholar [[H. R. Ellis Davidson]] links apples to religious practices in [[Germanic paganism]], from which [[Norse paganism]] developed. She points out that buckets of apples were found in the [[Oseberg ship]] burial site in Norway, that fruit and nuts (I\u00f0unn having been described as being transformed into a nut in ''[[Sk\u00e1ldskaparm\u00e1l]]'') have been found in the early graves of the [[Germanic peoples]] in England and elsewhere on the continent of Europe, which may have had a symbolic meaning, and that nuts are still a recognized symbol of [[fertility]] in southwest England.<ref name=\"autogenerated1\"/>\n\nDavidson notes a connection between apples and the [[Vanir]], a tribe of gods associated with [[fertility]] in Norse mythology, citing an instance of eleven \"golden apples\" being given to woo the beautiful [[Ger\u00f0r]] by [[Sk\u00edrnir]], who was acting as messenger for the major Vanir god [[Freyr]] in stanzas 19 and 20 of ''[[Sk\u00edrnism\u00e1l]]''. Davidson also notes a further connection between fertility and apples in Norse mythology in chapter 2 of the ''[[V\u00f6lsunga saga]]'' when the major goddess [[Frigg]] sends King [[Rerir]] an apple after he prays to Odin for a child, Frigg's messenger (in the guise of a crow) drops the apple in his lap as he sits atop a [[tumulus|mound]].<ref name=\"DAVIDSON165-166\"/> Rerir's wife's consumption of the apple results in a six-year pregnancy and the [[Caesarean section]] birth of their son\u2014the hero [[V\u00f6lsung]].<ref name=\"DAVIDSONROLES146-147\"/>\n\nFurther, Davidson points out the \"strange\" phrase \"Apples of [[Hel (location)|Hel]]\" used in an 11th-century poem by the [[skald]] Thorbiorn Br\u00fanarson. She states this may imply that the apple was thought of by Br\u00fanarson as the food of the dead. Further, Davidson notes that the potentially Germanic goddess [[Nehalennia]] is sometimes depicted with apples and that parallels exist in early Irish stories. Davidson asserts that while cultivation of the apple in Northern Europe extends back to at least the time of the [[Roman Empire]] and came to Europe from the [[Near East]], the native varieties of apple trees growing in Northern Europe are small and bitter.

Three of the more common diseases or pests are mildew, aphids, and apple scab.\n* [[Mildew]] is characterized by light grey powdery patches appearing on the leaves, shoots and flowers, normally in spring.

This can be treated similarly to [[Botryotinia|Botrytis]]\u2014eliminating the conditions that caused the disease and burning the infected plants are among recommended actions.<ref name=\"pest4\"/>\n* [[Aphids]] are a small insect. Five species of aphids commonly attack apples: apple grain aphid, rosy apple aphid, apple aphid, spirea aphid, and the woolly apple aphid. The aphid species can be identified by color, time of year, and by differences in the cornicles (small paired projections from their rear).<ref name=pest4/> Aphids feed on foliage using needle-like mouth parts to suck out plant juices. When present in high numbers, certain species reduce tree growth and vigor.<ref name=pest5>{{cite web |url=http://www.umass.edu/fruitadvisor/NEAPMG/index.htm |title=Apple Pest Management Guide |author=Coli, William |accessdate=3 March 2008 |publisher=University of Massachusetts Amherst |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080212130013/http://www.umass.edu/fruitadvisor/NEAPMG/index.htm |archivedate=12 February 2008 |url-status=live|display-authors=etal}}</ref>\n* [[Apple scab]]: Apple scab causes leaves to develop olive-brown spots with a velvety texture that later turn brown and become cork-like in texture.

Apples can be canned, dried or frozen.<ref name=applefood/> Canned or frozen apples are eventually baked into pies or other cooked dishes. Apple juice or cider is also bottled. Apple juice is often concentrated and frozen.\n\n===Popular uses===\nApples are often eaten raw. Cultivars bred for raw consumption are termed dessert or [[table apple]]s.\n* In the UK, a [[toffee apple]] is a traditional confection made by coating an apple in hot [[toffee]] and allowing it to cool. Similar treats in the U.S. are [[candy apple]]s (coated in a hard shell of crystallized sugar syrup) and [[caramel apples]] (coated with cooled [[caramel]]).\n* Apples are eaten with honey at the Jewish New Year of [[Rosh Hashanah]] to symbolize a sweet new year.<ref name=food/>\n\nApples are an important ingredient in many desserts, such as [[apple pie]], apple [[crumble]], [[apple crisp]] and [[apple cake]]. When cooked, some apple cultivars easily form a puree known as [[apple sauce]]. Apples are also made into [[apple butter]] and apple jelly. They are often [[baked]] or [[stewed]] and are also (cooked) in some meat dishes. Dried apples can be eaten or reconstituted (soaked in water, alcohol or some other liquid).\n\nApples are milled or pressed to produce [[apple juice]], which may be drunk unfiltered (called [[apple cider]] in North America), or filtered. Filtered juice is often concentrated and frozen, then reconstituted later and consumed. Apple juice can be [[fermentation (food)|fermented]] to make [[cider]] (called hard cider in North America), [[ciderkin]], and vinegar. Through [[distillation]], various alcoholic beverages can be produced, such as [[applejack (beverage)|applejack]], [[Calvados (spirit)|Calvados]], and [[apfelwein]].<ref>{{Cite book|title=Edible Medicinal And Non-Medicinal Plants: Volume 4, Fruits|isbn=9789400740532|location=|pages=|last1=Lim|first1=T.

This shogun appears in the [[Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles]] [[Comic book|comics]] and all of its related media.<ref name=\"nytimes\"/> In every incarnation of the ''TMNT'' franchise, he is depicted as the leader of the criminal organization known as the [[Foot Clan]], and serves as the [[main antagonist]] and [[archenemy]] of the Turtles and [[Splinter (Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles)|Splinter]].\n\nIn 2009, The Shredder was ranked as [[IGN]]'s 39th-greatest comic book villain of all time.\n{{TOC limit|3}}\n\n==Design==\nShredder's physical appearance remains fairly consistent in most incarnations of the character. Saki is a muscular Japanese man, most frequently seen in \"the Shredder\" persona, wearing a suit of armor vaguely based on that of a [[samurai]], sometimes with a cape. The armor consists of blade-covered metal plaques on his shoulders, forearms, hands (sometimes just his left hand, because he is left-handed), and shins; he wears a purple, gray, blue, or red robe that variously appears to be simple fabric or a form of [[chain mail]]. He also tends to wear a metal [[kabuto|helmet]] with a trident-shaped ornament on top, and a metal ninja style mask which covers his face, leaving only his eyes visible. In the 2003 TMNT series, the Shredder is a red alien Utrom named Ch'rell, who utilized an indestructible exo-suit to disguise himself as a human named Oroku Saki.\n\n[[Kevin Eastman]] got the idea for Shredder's armor from large trapezoidal cheese [[grater]]s which he envisioned on a villainous character's<ref>{{cite web|url=http://listverse.com/2014/08/16/10-strangest-facts-about-the-teenage-mutant-ninja-turtles/|title=10 Strangest Facts About The Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles|publisher=Listverse|language=English|author=Chris Jenkins|date=16 August 2014|accessdate=21 January 2017}}</ref> (originally named \"The Grater\" or \"Grate Man\") arms. He then said, \"Could you imagine a character with weapons on his arms like this?\" Peter Laird suggested the name The Shredder.<ref>The Making of 'Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles': Behind the Shells. 1991.</ref> Although Shredder is often depicted as the main antagonist in the Ninja Turtles franchise, it was never the creators' intention to be the case in his original inception in the Mirage Comics:\n\n{{quotation|In truth, though many TMNT fans who became fans via the first animated series see Shredder as a REALLY important part of an ongoing, long-running battle with the Turtles, I don't think Kevin or I ever did. Yes, he was an important part of their history, and they probably would not have come into existence without his involvement in their world (or more accurately Splinter's world)... but that's about it. Other than bringing Shredder back for \"Return to New York\" (and the few issues preceding that set that arc up), I never missed him in any of the other TMNT books I worked on.<br>\u2014[[Peter Laird]]<ref>{{cite book|last1=Eastman|first1=Kevin|last2=Laird|first2=Peter|title=Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: The Ultimate Collection, Vol. 2|year=2012|publisher=IDW|location=San Diego, Calif.|isbn=978-1613770887|page=227}}</ref>}}\n\n==Comic books==\n===Mirage and Image===\n====Oroku Saki====\nIn the [[Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles (Mirage Studios)|original comic books]] from [[Mirage Comics]], Oroku Saki is the younger brother of Oroku Nagi who had been killed by a fellow ninja [[Hamato Yoshi]] (the owner of [[Splinter (Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles)|Splinter]], the Turtles' mentor) in a feud over a woman named [[Tang Shen]] resulting in Yoshi fleeing with Shen to the United States.\n\nAngry at the death of his older brother, Saki joined the [[Foot Clan]] and trained to be a [[ninja]]. He quickly became one of their deadliest warriors and rose up the ranks and was chosen to lead the Foot's American branch. Operating in New York under the name of The Shredder, Saki used the opportunity to avenge his brother by killing Yoshi and Shen. Under Saki's leadership, the Foot participated in variety of criminal activities, including [[drug smuggling]], [[Arms trafficking|arms running]], and assassination.\n\nThirteen years later Saki was challenged by the Ninja Turtles, who were the result of an accident exposing four ordinary turtles to radioactive waste. They were trained by Yoshi's pet rat Splinter, who had also been mutated by the same substance, to avenge his former master. After a lengthy rooftop battle where Saki seemed to be winning, [[Leonardo (Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles)|Leonardo]] managed to plunge his sword through Saki's torso. Defeated, he was offered the opportunity to commit [[seppuku]] (ritual suicide), but Shredder refused and detonated a [[thermite]] grenade, in an attempt to take their lives as well along his. But at the last second, [[Donatello (Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles)|Donatello]] used his [[B\u014d|bo]] to knock Shredder off the building to his death.\n\nHowever, it was not yet the end of the Shredder. He returned on Christmas Eve seemingly resurrected with an army of Foot Ninjas severely beating Leonardo and burning down the apartment of the turtles' ally [[April O'Neil]], forcing them to go into hiding outside the city. A year later, in the story \"Return to New York\", the Turtles returned to settle the score with the Shredder. Leonardo faced off against Oroku Saki alone, during which Saki revealed he was brought back to life by a technique using worms feeding on his body and recreating his cells to reform his body. In the battle, Leonardo [[decapitate]]s the villain, finally killing him, and the four turtles burn his body at the [[Hudson River]]. In the Zulli's trilogy in issues 31, 35, and 36, Shredder attacks the turtles and Splinter before being defeated. Shredder also appears in the dream of Donatello in Volume 4 where he is shown fighting him.\n\nOroku Saki appears briefly in the image comics issue 3 of TMNT and the female ninja Pimiko from the comic book series' Volume 3<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.comicvine.com/pimiko/29-49933/ |title=Pimiko (comic book character) |publisher=Comicvine.com |date= |accessdate=2014-05-08}}</ref> claims to be Shredder's daughter.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.miragelicensing.com/comics/image/05/05.html |title=Image Comics' TMNT \"Volume 3\" #5 |publisher=Miragelicensing.com |date= |accessdate=2014-05-08}}</ref>\n\n==== ''Tales of the TMNT'' ====\nIn the second volume of the anthology series ''[[Tales of the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles]]'' story \"Worms of Madness\" it is shown that a few weeks after the events of their final battle the Shredder had yet another resurrection of sorts when a Foot mystic reactivated the worms; however, the mystic did not resurrect Saki himself but the worm colony which had gained sentience and retained Saki's memories and believing itself to be Saki. The worms then went out to find a new body and chose that of a shark. After the Foot Kidnapped Splinter, the turtles managed to engage the \"Shredder-Shark\" in battle and defeating it by severing its connection to the mystic and the creature realizing that it was not the real Saki.\n\nThe \"Shredder-Shark\" returned once more kidnapping Casey's adopted daughter Shadow to lure the Turtles into a trap. With the Turtles away, it was up to Casey and Splinter to defeat it and rescue Shadow, finally killing the creature.\n\n====Other versions of the Shredder====\nThroughout a considerable part of the Image comic series, [[Raphael (TMNT)|Raphael]] tries to impersonate Shredder by wearing his armor. Following this, he is accepted as the leader of the Foot Clan. In later issues of the series, a mysterious '''Lady Shredder''' appears to challenge Raphael. Although the book was canceled before her identity could be revealed, writer [[Gary Carlson]] confirmed after the fact that she was meant to be [[Karai (character)|Karai]].{{Citation needed|date=October 2007}}\n\nIn Volume Four series, [[Leonardo (Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles)|Leonardo]] encounters '''Oroku Yoshi''', a Battle Nexus contestant wearing armor almost identical to that of the second animated series' Shredder. His connection to Oroku Saki and the Foot is not known, since the bi-monthly comic was ultimately cancelled in 2010. In issue 32 he was called to meet a mysterious individual who asks to bring Leo with him as well.\n\nAnother Version called Doctor Shreddarius also appears in a reality where the turtles are superheroes.\n\n===Archie Comics===\nThe [[Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles (Archie Comics)|Archie Comics' series]] use the same background as the 1987 cartoon, as the first issues are identical. Later in the Archie comics, Shredder travels to the future and works with Armaggon and Verminator X to offset the skill and experience of the future versions of the Turtles.\n\nThis version of the character was more in line with the early episodes' depiction of the character as a cunning adversary and in many issues nearly proves to be a lethal enemy, coming close to defeating the turtles on a number of occasions, and even aids Armaggon and Verminator X in the defeat and capture of two of the turtles in the future. His final fate within the Archie comics series remains unknown, though a three-part mini-series put out by Archie comics after the end of their regular comic series seems to indicate he remains a consistent foe to the turtles for many years, briefly restoring Splinter to the form of Hamato Yoshi and also undoing Michaelangelo's mutation, though both later revert to mutant status by the end of the story, while Shredder was left in a vegetative state in the aftermath of his final battle with the Turtles.\n\n===IDW Publishing===\nIn feudal Japan, Oroku Saki was a high-ranking member of the Foot Clan along with Hamato Yoshi.

After the Turtles rescue Leonardo, Shredder calls a meeting with Krang and proposes an alliance in exchange for Utrom technologies, which Krang rejects. A short battle results in retreat on both sides and the revelation that Shredder had stolen some Utrom resources from Krang's compound to begin creating a mutant army (in the form of Bebop, Rocksteady, Koya and Bludgeon).<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\nIn Issue #50, Shredder faced Splinter and the turtles in a final battle which he lost and briefly admitted his faults and also making Karai the new head of the Foot Clan. He was then killed by Splinter by having his sword slashed into the back of his head, killing him instantly.\nAfter his death Shredder's body is kept in a crypt that is guarded by Jennika who was assigned by Hamato Yoshi in order to learn humility. Shredder's tomb is eventually desecrated by the witch Kitsune who plans to revive Oroku Saki in order to restore order to the Foot Clan but Splinter knew this and keeps the skull to foil her attempts. \n\nShredder will appear in the upcoming miniseries ''Shredder in Hell''. In the mini series Shredder is in the afterlife and descends into the underworld trying to find the truth of his own soul meanwhile Kitsune uses his corpse to summon her father as his host. Shredder also fought his past life Takeshi Tasuo in his inner conflict until Splinter/Hamato Yoshi later shows up to help him against the forces of Hell.\n\n==Television==\n===1987 animated series===\n[[File:TMNT1987 Shredder.png|thumb|Shredder in the 1987 animated series]]\n\nIn the [[Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles (1987 TV series)|1987 animated series]], Oroku Saki and Hamato Yoshi were both members of the Foot Clan in Japan. After Saki framed him for the attempted murder of a visiting [[sensei]], Yoshi was forced to [[exile]] himself to [[New York City]], where he lived in the sewers with four pet turtles that were accidentally dropped down a storm drain.\n\nIn the following years, Saki took leadership of the Foot Clan, and took on his Shredder persona. He also met a trans-dimensional alien called [[Krang]], and used the advanced technology at his disposal to replace the Foot Ninja with robots called the Foot Soldiers. He secretly moved to New York, where he found Yoshi still alive. In an attempt to kill his old foe, Shredder dumped mutagen in the sewers. This mutates Yoshi into Splinter, and he starts training the also mutated Turtles in [[ninjutsu]].\n\nShredder was voiced by [[James Avery]] for seasons one to seven and [[William E. Martin]] for seasons eight and ten, with the alternates being [[Dorian Harewood]] and [[Pat Fraley]] in 1989, [[Jim Cummings]] in 1991\u20131993 and [[Townsend Coleman]] in 1993. In the 2009 crossover movie ''[[Turtles Forever]]'', this incarnation of the Shredder was voiced by Load Williams. In the 2012 series, the 1987 version of the Shredder is voiced by [[Kevin Michael Richardson]].\n\n====Depiction====\nIn his early appearances, Shredder was presented as extremely cunning and was described by Splinter himself as the most dangerous adversary he ever faced. Shredder's intelligence persevered throughout his various portrayals, and in several instances it is claimed that Shredder has an IQ of 300. As the 1987 cartoon series was more light-hearted than the comics, Shredder was later depicted as an evil but a villain that always fails rather than the dire and lethal ninja he was originally shown to be. He and Krang are constantly bickering about tactics and often take pleasure in the other's failings (and sometimes intentionally sabotage each other). His two henchmen [[Bebop and Rocksteady]] are especially incompetent and fail miserably at everything they do. They were mostly used for [[comic relief]] in the show; however, the Turtles certainly consider them to be formidable (despite their inane stupidity) in combat due to their great strength and endurance, and as such, often use their intelligence to outwit them.\n\nDespite Shredder's failings, he is still shown to have considerable skills. In martial arts, he is often shown to surpass the Turtles and to be equaled only by Splinter. Nevertheless, he usually runs away from a fight when outnumbered, incapacitating the Turtles to defeat them in combat; as the series progressed, however, the Turtles were able to battle him on more equal grounds and even defeat him in combat on several occasions. He trained the Punk Frogs in a very short period of time to be a match for the Turtles, but the Punk Frogs soon switch sides. His technical skills are also quite impressive: he designed and built a robotic body for Krang, prepared the mutagen mixture, knew how Krang's teleportation engine worked, and built numerous other advanced devices. Ironically in one episode \"Shredderville\" the Turtles dream they find themselves in a [[parallel universe (fiction)|mirror universe]] where the TMNT ''never existed'' and Shredder rules New York City, yet finds the task of ruling so burdensome that he has a nervous breakdown.\n\nFrom mid season seven onwards, Shredder was depicted as a more serious threat, full of anger and bloodlust, though he was still easily defeated by the Turtles. His friendship with Krang also appeared to have grown. There were many times that Shredder could have just left Krang at the mercy of the Turtles or Lord Dregg, but he always rescued him, and went as far as to donate his life energy to save him.\n\n====Family====\nShredder's family is presented in three episodes. In the episode \"Shredder's Mom\",<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ninjaturtles.com/cartoon/guide/cart070.htm |title=TMNT Cartoon Episode 70! |publisher=Ninjaturtles.com |accessdate=2014-05-08 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110605021820/http://www.ninjaturtles.com/cartoon/guide/cart070.htm |archivedate=2011-06-05 }}</ref> Shredder's mother Miyoko helps Shredder and Krang in an attempt to destroy the world's climate. In this episode, Miyoko first learns of her son's criminal activities, and proves herself to be as villainous. However, she constantly treats Shredder like a baby, until he gets fed up with it and transports her back to her retirement home. In the episode \"My Brother, the Bad Guy\",<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ninjaturtles.com/cartoon/guide/cart108.htm |title=TMNT Cartoon Episode 108! |publisher=Ninjaturtles.com |accessdate=2014-05-08 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120210071625/http://www.ninjaturtles.com/cartoon/guide/cart108.htm |archivedate=2012-02-10 }}</ref> it is revealed that Oroku Saki has a younger brother, Kazuo who works as a police lieutenant in [[Tokyo]]. Kazuo and the Turtles try to join forces to stop one of Shredder's plans, but his fervent respect of the law clashes with the Turtles' \"whatever it takes\" attitude. Finally, the episode \"The Legend of Koji\"<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ninjaturtles.com/cartoon/guide/cart159.htm |title=TMNT Cartoon Episode 159! |publisher=Ninjaturtles.com |accessdate=2014-05-08 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120204035507/http://www.ninjaturtles.com/cartoon/guide/cart159.htm |archivedate=2012-02-04 }}</ref> features Saki's distant ancestor Oroku Sancho, who lived in Japan in 1583. He is the leader of a small clan, and every bit as wicked as his descendant. When Shredder offers to help him find magical relics that would provide him with power and wealth, Sancho takes Shredder's information, then betrays him and orders his men to kill him. However, Sancho is also a coward, and when he breaks down in the face of danger, his men abandon him.\n\nThis family tree leads to a bit of confusion regarding whether Shredder's given name is Oroku and his last name Saki (as indicated by the fact his brother shares the name Saki), or the other way around (as indicated by the fact his ancestor's last name is Oroku). This question is never resolved on the show, although Mirage comics adds more evidence for Oroku being the family name; Saki's brother is \"Oroku Nagi\". This follows Japanese naming conventions, which place the family name before an individual's given name.\n\n====Timeline====\nCounting from the first meeting with the Turtles, Shredder spent eight seasons plotting ways to defeat them.

Shredder is nowhere to be seen, but it is assumed that he is still somewhere in Dimension X.\n\nHe and Krang also appear in ''[[Turtles Forever]]'', with the Technodrome still under New York City before being sent into the 2003 universe. However, Shredder and Krang's incompetence (as well as their relative sanity) is fully shown when the Utrom Shredder of the 2003 universe seizes command of the Technodrome and adds Utrom technology to the powerful war machine, and turns it against the world. In the climax, Shredder temporarily overcomes his hatred for the Turtles as both he and Krang decide to help the Turtles defeat the Utrom Shredder who they realise is totally insane, will kill everyone and has effectively stolen the Technodrome from them. Shredder also takes extreme offense at being considered inferior by his other dimensional counterpart, doesn't see the point of destroying the entire universe and doesn't understand why the Utrom Shredder won't just kill the Turtles when he had the chance. So, with Krang, he chooses to fight alongside the Turtles against their common foe.\n\n===''The Next Mutation''===\nIn ''[[Ninja Turtles: The Next Mutation]]'', Shredder (portrayed by Patrick Pon, voiced by [[Doug Parker (voice actor)|Doug Parker]]) is still the Turtles' sworn enemy. This time, however, Venus uses her powers to make the Oroku Saki from within take control of Shredder's mind. After the Foot Clan disbands, he ends up living on the streets. Later, the Dragon Lord's rank warriors attack him to get a medallion that was in his possession. Splinter saves him and takes him to the Turtles' lair to protect him. It was hinted that Shredder might possibly go back to his old ways, but the show was canceled soon after that episode.\n\nIn the show, Shredder wore a general attire similar to the one he wore in the second film, but with a heavily altered helmet/mask due to the lesser budget for the TV series as compared to the movies, which had allowed for more detailed props and costume pieces. Shredder appeared only a few times in the show, due to the primary villain of the series being a draconic being from another dimension and thus supplanted Shredder as the Turtles' nemesis.\n\n===2003 animated series===\nNumerous individuals have assumed the \"'''Shredder'''\" mantle in the [[Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles (2003 TV series)|2003 animated series]], all of whom, except for Karai, are voiced by [[Scott Rayow|Scottie Ray]]. In the episode \"Tempus Fugit\", a possible future is shown in which the Utrom Shredder, Tengu Shredder, and Cyber Shredder are engaged in a war for control of New York City.\n\n====Utrom Shredder====\n[[File:TMNTCh'rell.png|thumb|The Shredder's armor is penetrated, revealing his true Utrom form]]\nThe Utrom Shredder is the main antagonist and primary Shredder of the series. He is the archenemy of the Turtles and Splinter, and indirectly had a hand in their creation. Utrom Shredder serves as the main antagonist of the first three seasons of the show as well as the finale film Turtles Forever. His digital copy also serves as the antagonist of the seventh and final season.\n\nAfter causing the deaths of millions across the universe, the psychopathic alien warlord Ch'rell (whose aliases include Torrinon, Kako Naso, and Duke Acureds) was captured by his fellow Utrom and being transported back to his home world to answer for his crimes. However, Ch'rell managed to escape captivity and sabotaged the Utrom ship, causing it to crash-land on Earth during the Sengoku period of feudal Japan. Stranded on the then-primitive planet, the Utrom were forced to wait for centuries until human technology advanced enough for them to develop a teleportation device and return home. They thus developed humanoid exo-suits to hide amongst the humans, and Ch'rell stole the first working prototype and used the Japanese legend of a Demon Tengu to craft a dual identity, becoming a wealthy Japanese philanthropist named Oroku Saki while secretly operating as the crime lord known as the Shredder. Saki soon founded the Foot Clan, which grew into a massive underground criminal empire by the 20th century. He eventually adopts an abandoned girl named [[Karai (Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles)|Karai]], whom he personally trained in the arts of ninjutsu to lead the Foot Clan in Japan while he operated in New York City. In New York, the Shredder captures Hamato Yoshi, one of the Utroms' foremost guardians, and kills him after he refuses to reveal their location. Yoshi's pet rat [[Splinter (Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles)|Splinter]] witnesses his murder and escapes, winding up in the city's sewers where he and four baby turtles are accidentally exposed to a mutagenic ooze created by the Utroms, transforming them into sentient humanoid lifeforms.\n\nIn the first season set over a decade later, the Turtles begin encountering the Foot Clan and unknowingly foiling several of the Shredder's operations. Oroku Saki becomes intrigued with the Turtles, wanting to meet them and hoping to bring them to his side. One day, he invites [[Leonardo]] to his home and offers him to join the Foot. The Turtles consult their master Splinter, who reveals his true nature by telling them of Master Yoshi's murder. The Shredder eventually becomes the greatest enemy of the Turtles when they decline his offer. During their first engagement, the Shredder proves himself to be more skilled than the Turtles, compelling them to flee and hide. While Shredder and his Foot Ninja search for the Turtles, Splinter finds and regroups them, and plans a counterattack. In a subsequent battle on the rooftops, the Shredder outmatches the Turtles again, but Splinter tricks him into cutting the support for a water tower, which is kicked onto him. The water sweeps Shredder off the building, and the tower collapses to the ground, crushing him. But a few scenes later, Shredder's hand is shown to emerge from the wreckage of the water tower.\n\nSplinter and the Turtles were unaware of the Shredder's survival until months later, on one day when Leonardo goes on an outdoor morning training exercise, only to be ambushed by the Foot Clan. The Shredder's four Elite Guard beat Leonardo close to death and send him flying into a window of [[April O'Neil]]'s antique shop apartment, where the Turtles were staying after Foot Ninjas had marauded their sewer home while they were away. Soon afterwards, the Shredder leads an assault on April's shop. Overpowered and outnumbered, the Turtles, Splinter, April and [[Casey Jones (Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles)|Casey Jones]] are forced to run off into retreat in a walk-in cooler. The Shredder then bars the door, drops a firebomb and punctures a gas pipe with his gauntlets. Fortunately, April remembers that the motor used to power the cooler was removed, leaving a hole in the exterior wall that leads outside. As a result, the Turtles and their allies are able to evacuate the building before it burns down. They retreat to Casey's grandmother's farmhouse in [[Northampton, Massachusetts]], where they would spend the next three months recuperating.\n\nDuring this time, they are presumed dead by the Foot, but Oroku Saki sends the clan's mad scientist [[Baxter Stockman]] the task of confirming their deaths. Although Stockman finds no proof that the Turtles died, he creates false evidence to convince the Shredder and succeeds in doing so. When Leonardo is completely healed from his injuries, the Turtles and Splinter return to New York to face the Shredder once more. They launch a surprise assault on the Foot headquarters, fighting their way through Shredder's minions and eventually reaching his throne. By the end of the battle, an epic standoff between Leonardo and the Shredder occurs. Armed with the Sword of Tengu, the former decapitates the latter when they strike each other in one final clash. Not knowing that the Shredder is an Utrom, the Turtles believe him to be finally killed for good. After they leave, the Shredder is seen to be getting up and walking away carrying his severed head.\n\nIn the second season, Ch'rell seeks to exact revenge on his species. He and his henchmen infiltrate the TCRI facility, where the Utroms' base is located, and coincidentally encounter the Turtles and Master Splinter. When the Shredder is zapped into unconsciousness, a time bomb slips out of his hands, set to detonate in ten minutes. The Turtles help the Utroms escape using the Transmat, a teleportation device, which [[Donatello (Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles)|Donatello]] activates. After the Utroms teleport back to their homeworld, the Shredder awakens and attacks the Turtles. In the ensuing fight, the Turtles use their weapons to penetrate his armor, which is then electrocuted by Donatello, disabling it. Afterwards, the Shredder reveals his Utrom form to the Turtles, intent on taking down his enemies with him. But at the last few seconds, Donatello manages to power up the Transmat, through which he, his brothers and Splinter escape before the TCRI building implodes with Ch'rell inside of it.\n\nWith his supposed demise, the Foot Clan (led by the Elite Guard), the Purple Dragons and the New York Mafia clash with each other for control of New York City. Unknown to them, the Shredder had survived once more and was retrieved by his daughter Karai, now being placed in a stasis tube and healed by worms inside a secret medical facility of the Foot headquarters. During his recuperation, Karai assumes leadership of the Foot Clan and makes peace with the Turtles after they help her end the turf war. But once the Shredder is fully recovered, he vows vengeance and breaks off the truce, leaving Karai to question her loyalty. By this point, Baxter Stockman had created the Foot Mechs, mainly in the form of armed ninja robots, but also versions of the U.S. President, the English Prime Minister and Splinter. His plans were again thwarted by the Turtles, when his barge hideout is located by them, Splinter, and their unlikely ally, the delusional Triceraton Zog, leading to another confrontation with the Foot. Aboard the freighter, Donatello programs a bomb set to go off in 30 minutes. The Shredder is defeated again when Zog sacrifices his life by keeping him on his ship when it sinks due to the explosion, but Karai rescues him on a helicopter.\n\nIn the third season, the Triceratons launch an invasion on Earth. In the aftermath of the invasion, New York City is in ruins. In his persona as Oroku Saki, the Shredder uses his fortune to repair the damage and gains favor of its citizens. Secretly, his real purpose of reconstruction was to salvage the remnants of Triceraton technology in order to construct a large starship to return to the stars, and thereby retaliating against the Utrom. He even enlists a young scientist named Dr. Chaplin to help out. The craft is eventually completed, but Ch'rell's plan suffers several complications, courtesy of the Turtles and the Earth Protection Force (led by Agent Bishop). Despite sustaining heavy damage, the ship is launched into orbit, albeit with the Turtles and Splinter on board. When Karai notes that they left their forces on Earth, Ch'rell states that he has allies on other worlds that can help him. Entering a four-armed Shredder exo-suit, Ch'rell easily defeats them all, prompting the Turtles and Splinter to attempt to sacrifice themselves and blow the ship up in a final attempt to stop the Shredder. Luckily, as the starship explodes, Mortu and the Utrom arrive, having placed a stasis field around the entire ship, freezing time, and teleport all its inhabitants to safety. While the Turtles and Splinter are teleported to sick bay and Professor Honeycutt is taken to one of their labs to be placed in a new robot body, Ch'rell, Karai, and Dr. Chaplin are teleported to the brig. On the Utrom homeworld, Ch'rell is placed on trial before the Utrom High Council that is watched by the Turtles, Splinter, and Professor Honeycutt. The Utrom High Council start by mentioning a testimony from Dolphette that Ch'rell willingly launched an attack on the planet Enethone where over 1 million innocent inhabitants perished. Then they bring up Wan-ran Otho's testimony where Ch'rell incited and funded a civil war on the planet Eno II in an effort to mine their raw minerals without restriction. 3,200,000 lives perished. The Utrom High Council then concludes that Ch'rell tried various attempts to take over the Utrom government through an illegal and violent coup. The Utrom High Council found Ch'rell guilty for the chaos and destruction he brought across the universe, and ultimately sentence him to eternal exile on the desolate ice asteroid Mor Gal Tal. Mortu states to everyone present that Karai and Dr. Chaplin will be returned to Earth and handed over to the authorities.\n\nIn the finale film ''[[Turtles Forever]]'', Ch'rell is freed from his exile by his Shredder counterpart from the 1987 series after his frozen body was teleported off of Mor Gal Tal by 1980s Shredder and Krang. Once Karai showed up upon finding out about Ch'rell's return, Ch'rell then takes over the Technodrome and gains a new, more powerful exo-suit. After realigning with a now-mutated Hun, Ch'rell reverse-engineers the mutagen that Hun got to turn a select number of Cyber Foot into Mutant Foot Soldiers and create new Foot Robots that are stronger than the '80s versions. The Ch'rell later uses the Technodrome to view alternate dimensions, realizing that there is an entire multiverse of Ninja Turtles. Locating the Turtles' source planet, Turtle Prime, Ch'rell vows to eliminate every Ninja Turtle in existence by destroying this dimension. The Mirage Turtles, the 1987 Turtles, and the 2003 Turtles team up to defeat Ch'rell, though Karai and Splinter agree that the Shredder will return again as he always does.\n\nIn \"Same As It Never Was\", Donatello is transported to an alternate future in which the Shredder has succeeded in subjugating Earth. By then, Splinter had died protecting his sons and Casey Jones died fighting the Foot Clan. Ch'rell also severed [[Michelangelo (Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles)|Michelangelo]]'s left arm and [[Raphael (Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles)|Raphael]]'s left eye. When Donatello leads a final rebellion against the Shredder's fortress, his Foot forces kill Michelangelo while Karai kills Leonardo and Raphael. April avenges Leonardo and Raphael by using a rocket launcher on Karai, and the Shredder is killed by Donatello with the Tuneller.\n\nIn \"Timing is Everything\", Leonardo and Cody Jones are accidentally sent back in time to the aftermath of the Turtles' first battle with the Shredder. Later, the Shredder and several Foot ninjas are transported to 2105 but are easily defeated by the Turtles' futuristic technology.\n\n====Tengu Shredder====\nThe '''Tengu Shredder''' or the '''Demon Shredder''' serves as the main antagonist of the fifth season. The first Shredder was a Demon Tengu that rose from a hellish pit and terrorized ancient Japan. When on the verge of death, it entered and possessed a human named Oroku Saki, one of Japan's most skilled warriors, but he was eventually defeated by the power of the Ninja Tribunal. His body, helmet, and gauntlet were separated and sealed away to prevent his return. In the 21st century, the Tengu Shredder's five Foot Mystic heralds attempt to resurrect him, forcing the Ninja Tribunal to recruit the Turtles and four human warriors as their Acolytes to defeat. After the Tengu Shredder rises from the dead and conquers New York City, the Turtles recruit Karai's Foot Clan, the Justice Force, the Earth Protection Force, and the Purple Dragons to defeat him. The Tengu Shredder is weakened when Karai drains his power via a mystic link (which connects all who take the mantle of the Shredder), and he is finally destroyed when the Turtles combine their Dragon avatars to summon the spirit of Hamato Yoshi to deliver the final blow.\n\n====Cyber Shredder====\nThe '''Cyber Shredder''' appears as the main antagonist of the seventh and final season, ''Back to the Sewer''. It is revealed that prior to Ch'rell's exile, he created a digital copy of himself in the event that anything happened to his corporeal form and stored this double in a Foot data vault deep within the Internet. This vault's consciousness is later released when the futuristic Viral attempts to access it, giving rise to the Cyber Shredder. While he is initially confined to cyberspace, the Cyber Shredder ultimately manages to escape and become a physical being. During the final episode, the Cyber Shredder leads the Foot Clan to attack April O'Neil and Casey Jones's wedding, and is finally defeated when the Turtles erased him with a de-compiler previously used against Viral.\n\n====Karai====\n'''Karai''' is the adopted daughter of Oroku Saki (Ch'rell), who takes the mantle of the Shredder after her father's exile. After some lesser battles, she doffs the mantle and begins a non-hostile relationship with the Turtles, particularly towards Leonardo.\n\n===2012 animated series===\nThe Shredder appears as the main antagonist of the [[Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles (2012 TV series)|2012 animated series]], voiced by [[Kevin Michael Richardson]].\n\nHis Japanese origins as Oroku Saki and brotherly relationship with Hamato Yoshi is mostly intact, with the Foot Clan and the Hamato Clan being later revealed as having a long-term rivalry before the Hamato family killed the Oroku family, wiped out their entire clan (starting with the destruction of the Foot Clan monastery) and took in the orphaned Saki as their own. Despite being raised as brothers, both Saki and Yoshi eventually became rivals due to the love of Tang Shen, whose decision to marry Yoshi drove Saki to discover his true heritage and turn on his former brother, eventually destroying everything Yoshi held dear, including the lovely Tang Shen (whom he had killed by accident) and the entire Hamato Clan (starting with the destruction of the Hamato Clan monastery, which resulted with Saki's head getting burned scarred and hairless). Blaming Tang Shen's untimely death on Yoshi, Saki returned to his biological family and became the new leader of the newly restored Foot Clan, tutoring ninjutsu students such as world-famous martial artist [[Tokka and Rahzar|Chris Bradford]] and Brazilian street thug Xever Montes, sharing criminal business with business partners such as Russian arms dealer [[Bebop and Rocksteady|Ivan Steranko]], Sicilian mob boss Don Visiozo, and Purple Dragons leader Hun. In addition, he also a pet [[Akita (dog)|akita]] named Hachiko (named after the [[Hachiko|akita of the same name]]) who played a part in Bradford's mutation into Dogpound after Hachiko bit him.\n\nShredder first appeared in the end of \"Rise of the Turtles, Part 2\" where he traveled to New York when he learned that Hamato Yoshi is training his own ninjas after seeing a shuriken with his clan symbol on a [[shuriken]] left behind by the Turtles during a recent fight on a TV news report. Determined to finally end his age-old rival's life, he sent the Foot Clan after the Turtles until he made his first confrontation with the Turtles in person in \"The Gauntlet\", where victory was seemingly in his grasp before he was distracted by the mutating Bradford and Montes. Although Shredder planned to kill former TCRI inventor [[Baxter Stockman]] for interfering with his plans to kill the Turtles in \"MOUSERS Attack\", he changed his mind by commenting on how Stockman's scientific knowledge could be useful to him. Shredder is also Karai's father, as seen in \"New Girl in Town\". However, in \"Showdown\", during Shredder's battle with Splinter, he reveals that in the aftermath of the fight that caused Tang Shen's death, he took Splinter's daughter, Miwa, and raised her as Karai. He has told her that he is her biological father and it was Splinter who killed her mother, as she has sworn revenge ever since. Shredder initially dismissed the Kraang's presence in New York, but after capturing one, decided to ally with them to destroy the Turtles. The partnership seems stable, though it would seem the Shredder still did not fully trust his new allies.\n\nEarly in the second season, in \"Follow the Leader\", he left for Japan to deal with a situation, leaving Karai as the interim leader of his Foot Clan. He ordered her not to attack the Turtles nor make any dealings with the Kraang behind his back, and was livid when his adoptive daughter disobeyed him. He returned in \"The Manhattan Project\", with Tiger Claw, a Japanese circus performer who was mutated into Shredder's deadly assassin and new first lieutenant. Tiger Claw was able to bring Splinter before him, but complication from a Kraang operation in the city and the Turtles' own efforts rob Shredder of his chance to kill his old foe once again. In \"The Wrath of Tiger Claw\", Shredder and Tiger Claw attempted to use Karai to set a trap for the Turtles, but when she saw a photograph of Hamato Yoshi, Tang Shen, and herself as an infant, she realized that the Turtles were telling the truth and sided with them, resulting in her being captured while buying them time to escape Tiger Claw. Shredder still cared about his adoptive daughter, though, as seen in \"The Legend of the Kuro Kabuto\", where he visited her in her cell and explained why he kept everything a secret and hoped that she will one day understand. After his helmet, the titular Kuro Kabuto, was stolen by professional thief [[Bebop and Rocksteady|Anton Zeck]] on behalf of Steranko, Shredder found Zeck's calling card on a glued-down Rahzar and ordered the entire clan before him. Explaining the helmet's history as a special Foot Clan relic, he had the clan hunt for Zeck, sending Fishface with Stockman-Fly and Rahzar with Tiger Claw. Leonardo later confronted Shredder with the Kabuto for a trade and kept him busy long enough for the other Turtles to get to Karai. However, the \"Karai\" Shredder traded them with turned out to be a dummy rigged with a bomb as the Turtles evaded it. In \"Vengeance is Mine\", Shredder attempted to use the real Karai as bait for a trap that would mutate the Turtles into snakes that would kill Splinter, but the plan backfired when Karai was exposed to the mutagen, turning into a snake and almost attacking Splinter before she fled after regaining control of herself.\n\nIn the two-part second-season finale \"The Invasion\", Shredder and Kraang Prime formed a full alliance in which Shredder and the Foot Clan will help the Kraang take over New York and then the world and in turn the Kraang would return Karai to normal, and deliver Splinter and the Turtles to him. Later, he watched as Leonardo fought and eventually defeated his army of Foot Bots, after which he sent Rahzar, Fishface, and Tiger Claw to take care of him. Leonardo managed to subdue them for a short period of time before Shredder got involved and badly injured Leonardo. Later, Splinter confronted him and the two battled until Splinter got trapped under large metal pipes. Shredder was prepared to kill his rival once and for all; however, [[Leatherhead (TMNT)|Leatherhead]] intervened, and was defeated when Shredder sliced the front of his torso and kicked him of the edge of the dock. Splinter became furious as he broke out from under the pipes and tackled Shredder to the sewers. Later, the Turtles (minus Leonardo) and April watched helplessly from behind metal bars as Shredder defeated Splinter and seemingly killed him by throwing him down a large draining bay.\n\nIn the middle of the third season in \"Return to New York\", tensions began to grow high within the Foot of their alliance with the Kraang, but Shredder convinced everyone that he will keep his promise to take the city back from them. After a feral Splinter was found by the Foot-Bots and taken before him, Shredder had Stockman-Fly work on restoring his memory, which is what April did instead with her Kraang powers when she, the Turtles and Casey Jones returned to the city to rescue their sensei. In \"The Pig and the Rhino\", Shredder sent a now mutated Steranko and Zeck (who are later renamed Bebop and Rocksteady by Michelangelo) to find Karai again, like they did recently before the Turtles helped her escape, or else they'll be given something even more painful than mutation. After the Turtles unknowingly led them to her, the two succeeded in re-capturing Karai (while the Turtles weren't looking) and delivering her back to Shredder, who promised to fix everything he's done to her. The Kraang invasion eventually came to a stop made by the Turtles and the [[Mighty Mutanimals]], but its effects had eventually gave Shredder a gift for his cooperation with the Kraang, which shifted the balance of power within the city's criminal underworld over to the Foot. For him, this was achieved by gaining control of the [[Purple Dragons]] and other Asian gangs through Hun, several South American gangs through Fishface, the [[Russian mafia|Russian mob]] through Rocksteady, and the [[Sicilian mafia|Sicilian mob]] through Vizioso. By using this power, Shredder had these crime groups aid him with collecting various chemicals from a chemical company called Aumen Chemicals, an abandoned Kraang lab and Vizioso for a mind-control serum that he planned to create and use on the Turtles, the Mutanimals, and Karai.\n\nIn the two-part season 3 finale, ''Annihilation: Earth!'' he briefly teams up with Splinter to stop a black hole machine that was to destroy the Earth. He briefly fought the Triceratons until he followed Splinter, double crossing and stabbing him in the back, killing him instantly in front of the turtles. They rushed to Splinter while April blew Shredder away with a blast from her mind. Proclaiming that his victory over Splinter is more important to him than even saving the world, Shredder is sucked into the black hole along with his followers and Splinter while the turtles, April and Casey escape Earth's destruction and then in \"Beyond the Known Universe\", they travel back in time to six months earlier in an effort to prevent this event from happening. In \"Earth's Last Stand\" these events were revisited, but the arrival of the Turtles from the future resulted in Shredder's attempt to murder Splinter being thwarted. The two engaged briefly in battle with Splinter proving victorious, and the unconscious Shredder was carried away by Tiger Claw.\n\nIn \"City at War\" due to the injuries he sustained from Splinter, Shredder has been confined to a hospital bed under the care of Stockman with Bebop and Rocksteady as his bodyguards. When Tiger Claw returns to report the loss of an entire weapons cache thanks to the Turtles and Karai back in Manhattan, making it clear Karai wants to take Shredder down one piece at a time by destroying his criminal empire before taking him out, Shredder decrees that if it's a war Karai wants, it's a war she'll get, before Stockman hooks an I.V. filled with mutagen up to Shredder, and as the mutagen is injected into Shredder, his eyes open wide as the mutagen takes effect. In \"The Insecta Trifecta\", Shredder is still receiving the mutagen drip as he now turns to Stockman as his last hope due to his undying loyalty since Tiger Claw and the others have become useless as of late in stopping Karai and the Turtles. When Stockman returns to report his mission a failure, Shredder is not worried about it, revealing to Stockman that his mutagen drip is finally taking effect as Shredder deploys a pair of blades from the back of his hand, right out of the skin itself. In \"The Super Shredder\", Shredder forces Stockman to give him the rest of the mutagen drip, which mutated him into his Super Shredder form, although it ended up monstrous he was still pleased. This form left him with blades coming out of his body, a muscular build, and bandaged feet and ankles. Shredder then collects his henchmen and travels back to his old lair. Karai tries to fight the Shredder along with Shinigami, but Shredder easily knocks Shinigami unconscious and he escapes with Karai. He then notices a van coming straight towards him (The Shell Raiser), and flips it over. He tells the turtles to have splinter meet him at the place that he last beat him. Shredder then sets the vehicle on fire and the turtles flee to the sewers. Shredder then creates a trap for Splinter and the Turtles, which is full of photos of Splinter, Tang Shen, and Karai. When Splinter enters he drops bars of iron to avoid them from escaping. He then light fire towards them but they jump underwater. As the Turtles, Splinter, and April continue to approach Shredder, Karai makes a remark and Splinter follows, but later finds out he was led into another trap. Shredder forces Splinter to fight him but Splinter escapes, ready to set up a plan of his own. Splinter leads Shredder to the Undercity, where he puts his plan into action. Shredder eventually finds Splinter and he steps on his tail. Shredder then takes Splinter deeper into the UnderCity, where he decides to finish him. Just as Shredder was about to strike Splinter, his arm started to lose control, causing him to step back. Splinter then throws a blade at a few gas tanks and both Splinter and Shredder fall to their deaths. However, in the following episode, \"Darkest Plight\", Shredder and Splinter are separated during the fall, and Shredder returns to the top of the Under-city to be rescued by Tiger Claw, who takes him back to recover before hunting down the Turtles. While Tiger Claw deals with April and Karai, Shredder goes after Leonardo, and nearly crushes him to death before Karai and April arrive to help. During the battle, Shredder tosses a wrecked fuel tanker semi-truck at Karai, only for April to catch it in her psychic grip, causing her Sol Star crystal to cause her eyes to glow blue and smile malevolently before hurling it back at Shredder. However, before Shredder can kill Leo, Karai pleads with him to reconsider doing something good in his life instead of being consumed by his vengeance. This lures Shredder in close enough for Karai to hit him in his most vulnerable spot: His exposed, pulsating mutated heart. Weakened, Shredder is saved by Tiger Claw, who drives him back to their hideout, where Shredder demands a larger dose of the mutagen from Stockman. When Tiger Claw objects, knowing it is too dangerous, Shredder overpowers him, forces Stockman to administer the dosage and roars as the mutagen takes effect as Tiger Claw watches in horror and fear. In \"Tale of Tiger Claw\", he is shown as a M.O.U.S.E.R. hologram to warn Tiger Claw of his next move against Splinter.\n\nIn \"Requiem\", he returns to New York City, far stronger and more vengeful than ever before. He shows up at the hideout where Karai is planning her next move with Shnigami and the Mighty Mutanimals. He defeats the Mutanimals effortlessly and badly injures Karai in the process. On the WOLF building, he faces off against Splinter, Slash, Raphael, April and Casey. He ultimately manages to murder Splinter and hurls him from the building to his death. He is then blasted by a tremendously powerful psychic wave from an enraged April, and is crushed by a garbage truck, though he again survives the onslaught.\n\nIn the [[Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles (2012 TV series, season 4)|season four]] finale \"Owari\" he has his lackeys prepare for the inevitable arrival of the Turtles, April and Casey. He burns down his new lair and confronts the Turtles in a final showdown on the roof. His unique mutation makes him immune to Donatello's retro-mutagen, which allows him to beat Raphael, Donatello and Michelangelo all at once, leaving only Leonardo left standing. After a heated one-on-one duel, Shredder is finally killed by Leonardo.\n\nMany months later, the Kabuto and his own heart were separated by unknown means and hidden in secret locations throughout New York. His heart was contained within a glass vial that came into the possession of Don Vzioso, which Tiger Claw and Kavaxas seek, as it is essential to revive him and then came back in a zombie-like form that wanted to die. Zombie Shredder was able to drag Kavaxas back to the Netherworld as they \"belong dead.\"\n\n===2018 animated series===\nIn the [[Rise of the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles|2018 animated series]], Shredder appears as the demonic leader of the Foot Clan. His backstory is that he was a man who was consumed by the Kuroi Yoroi armor. Shredder terrorized Japan until he was defeated by Splinter's ancestors 500 years ago and the Kuroi Yoroi was scattered across the world to prevent his return.\n\nThe Foot Clan, allied with Baron Draxum, are collecting the armor pieces to resurrect him starting in \"Shadow of Evil.\"\n\nIn \"Warren and Hypno, Sitting in a Tree\", Baron Draxum claims the gauntlet that turned out to be part of the Kuroi Yoroi.\n\nIn \"Operation: Normal\", the Foot Lieutenant and the Foot Brute target the slime Y\u014dkai Sunita because the boots she was wearing are part of the Kuroi Yoroi. They managed to claim them.\n\nIn \"How to Make Enemies and Bend People to Your Will\", Baron Draxum and the Foot Recruit find Kuroi Yoroi fragment is at the botanical gardens. They claim it after setting up events where the Foot Lieutenant and the Foot Brute would fail.\n\nIn \"One Man's Junk\", the next piece of the Kuroi Yuroi was in the possession of Repo Mantis who claimed from a Y\u014dkai and held in his salvage yard. After trapping the cat/mantis mutant Mrs. Nubbins who was owned by Repo Mantis, the Turtles learn from him that two fire-headed guys working as shoe salesmen bought them metal from him. This causes the Turtles to learn that the Foot Lieutenant and the Foot Brute claimed the metal.\n\nAfter the Kuroi Y\u014droi was completed in \"End Game\", Baron Draxum dons the armor and the Foot Brute and Lieutenant address him as Shredder, but he rejects the title. Furthermore, due to a flaw in the armor (the Turtles' Jupiter Jim figure shoved in to cover a hole when the faceplate was used as a tea kettle), the transformation failed to complete. After Draxum was defeated and cast out of the armor, it reassembled itself, having drained Draxum of his life force.\n\nIn \"Many Happy Returns\", Shredder acted like a feral beast. The Foot Lieutenant, Foot Brute, and Foot Recruit retreat to find out what went wrong. After discovering a flux in Shredder, Big Mama was able to provide a baubel for the Turtles and Splinter to trap Shredder with her doing a secret last-minute alteration to this plan.\n\n==Films==\nThe Shredder was played by [[James Saito]] in the first movie and by [[Fran\u00e7ois Chau]] in the second, while his immense Super Shredder form was played by professional wrestler [[Kevin Nash]].<ref>[https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0621760/ Kevin Nash (I)<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> In all cases, the character was voiced by David McCharen. The Shredder's costume was, in the first movie, originally the same as in the original comic, with a red color. However, this was changed in the sequel to a violet color, reflecting the more cartoonish nature of the second film. In both movies, he also had a silver and black cape. In both films, he is served by his second-in-command Tatsu. In the Japanese versions, the Shredder is voiced by [[Norio Wakamoto]] (1st movie in VHS version), [[Hidekatsu Shibata]] (first movie in TV version), and [[Takeshi Watabe]] (second movie).\n\n===''Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles'' (1990)===\n[[File:Shredder (James Saito).jpg|thumb|upright|[[James Saito]] as The Shredder in the film ''[[Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles (1990 film)|Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles]]'' (1990)]]\n\nIn the first movie ''[[Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles (1990 film)|Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles]]'', Oroku Saki and Hamato Yoshi were rival martial artists in Japan and both loved a woman named Tang Shen. Shen, who loved only Yoshi, persuaded him not to fight Saki honorably; instead, they fled for the United States. Saki followed them to New York City; when Yoshi returned home from his construction job he found his beloved Shen lying on the floor. And then, he saw her killer. Saki wasted no words and during the struggle, Splinter's cage was broken. Splinter leaped up into Saki's face, biting and clawing. But Saki threw him to the floor and took one swipe with his [[katana]], slicing Splinter's ear. After this incident, it was said that Saki is never heard from again. The comic book adaptation of the film retains the original comic book origin story, with Oroku Nagi being slain and Saki coming to America to seek vengeance.\n\nSaki, in the \"Shredder\" persona, establishes an American branch of the Foot Clan. With the aid of his second-in-command Tatsu, he manipulates and recruits troubled teens as a brutal yet Machiavellian leader and father figure, teaching them ninjitsu to make them into skilled thieves and [[Assassination|assassins]]. Shredder sends the Foot Clan to \"silence\" [[April O'Neil]] when she reports on the Foot Clan's connection to the recent crime wave, inadvertently leading them to the Turtles' hideout when Raphael saves April. Shredder had Splinter kidnapped and imprisoned him in his warehouse hideout, and has the Foot Clan hunt the Turtles. He beats Splinter while interrogating him about how the Turtles learned their fighting techniques.\n\nAfter the Turtles successfully defeat the Foot Clan in a final assault, Shredder confronts them on a rooftop. He defeats all of the Turtles with his superior skills and threatens Leonardo with his [[yari]] to force the others to toss away their weapons. Splinter, freed by Turtles' allies, Danny Pennington and [[Casey Jones (TMNT)|Casey Jones]], intervenes and reveals to Shredder that they met years ago, as he was Hamato Yoshi's pet. Shredder unmasks himself, revealing the scars that Splinter gave him, and charges towards Splinter to impale him. Splinter counters with Michelangelo's [[nunchaku]] to send him over the side of the roof. Shredder throws a tanto at Splinter. Splinter caught the knife, but had to let go of the nunchaku that was holding onto the spear, making Shredder fall into a parked [[garbage truck]] far below. Casey Jones then activates the crushing mechanism; the viewers are then shown a closeup of the Shredder's helmet being crushed, implying his death.\n\n===''TMNT II: The Secret of the Ooze'' (1991)===\nIn the second movie ''[[Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles II: The Secret of the Ooze]]'', the Turtles believe that since Casey had crushed him in the garbage truck, the Shredder was dead. It is soon revealed that Shredder had survived the crushing and revitalized his Foot Clan to get vengeance on the Turtles. After finding the Foot \"fallback\" headquarters in a junkyard, Tatsu was asking who would challenge him to cover for Shredder until Shredder appeared. Tatsu allowed Shredder to lead the Foot Clan. Shredder sent a member of the Foot to follow April, hoping to find the Turtles through her. When April's team was doing a report on T.G.R.I. in [[New Jersey]], April's camera operator/Foot Clan member Freddy found some mutated [[dandelion]]s and sent one to the Shredder. He then orders Tatsu to obtain a sample of the T.G.R.I. mutagen that mutated the Turtles, as well as kidnap researcher Jordan Perry. Using the last mutagen and Perry's research, the Shredder creates his own mutants, [[Tokka and Rahzar]], from a stolen [[Alligator snapping turtle|snapping turtle]] and a brown [[wolf]] respectively. Though initially enraged at their infant-like intelligence, he soon plays it to his advantage by manipulating the mutants as they imprinted him as their surrogate parent.\n\nAfter a failed attempt to kill the Turtles in the junkyard using a captured Raphael, Shredder unleashed Tokka and Rahzar onto a city street to \"have fun\" and destroy it. The Foot spy then gave April a message for the Turtles: that the Shredder would turn the mutants loose on [[Central Park]] next if they did not accede to a rematch at the construction site. After the Turtles de-mutate the two mutants (with help from Perry) and defeat Tatsu in a nightclub, the Shredder appears and threatens to mutate an innocent woman with a small reserve mutagen vial (the canister was knocked away by the Turtles' new human ally, Keno). Before he can mutate her, he is stopped when the Turtles play a keytar at full volume, sending the Shredder flying through a window from the force of a blown speaker. When the Turtles follow him outside on a pier, they discover that the Shredder has used the mutagen vial on himself. He is transformed into a massive \"Super Shredder\", an almost mindless giant-mutant being with immense [[superhuman strength]]. During his fight with the Turtles, Super Shredder knocks down the pier's pilings in a mindless rage, which then collapses onto him with the Turtles falling into the water below. Though the Turtles survive, the Shredder meets his demise from getting crushed by the destroyed pieces of the pier.\n\n===''Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles III'' (1993) and ''TMNT'' (2007)===\nThe Shredder did not appear in the [[Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles III|third film]] but is shown briefly at the beginning of the [[TMNT (film)|fourth film]] to help give the backstory of the Turtles, and his helmet that he wore in the 1990 film is visible on Splinter's shelf of mementos at the end of the movie. The possibility of his return is also strongly hinted at in the end of the film by Karai. However, the established storyline was abandoned in favor of the 2014 reboot.\n\n===''Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles'' (2014)===\n[[Japanese Americans|Japanese American]] actor Tohoru Masamune portrayed the Shredder in ''[[Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles (2014 film)|Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles]]''.<ref>{{cite web|title=Film Review: 'Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles'|website=variety.com|url=https://variety.com/2014/film/reviews/film-review-teenage-mutant-ninja-turtles-1201274733/|quote= Several years later, a crime wave is in full force in the city, led by a walking Cutco display called the Shredder (Tohoru Masamune) and his massive Foot Clan, though they've started to get their asses whupped by a stealthy troupe of martial-arts-savvy vigilantes.|accessdate=August 4, 2014}}</ref> Initially, [[William Fichtner]] was intended to portray a Caucasian version of the Shredder, with the anglicized real name of [[Eric Sacks]], instead of Oroku Saki.<ref>{{cite web|title='Crossing Lines': William Fichtner Reveals 'Sons Of Anarchy' Star Joining Show|url=http://huffpost.com/ca/entry/3478979|quote=What are you doing in \"Ninja Turtles\"?

In contrast to much of the brand's history, Sacks, not Shredder, is the character connected to the Turtles' origins, having created them alongside April O'Neil's father; the Shredder (never referred to with any name other than his codename) has no connection to Splinter or the Turtles, and while he is shown to have scars on his face, it is not revealed how he suffered them.\n\nIn the earliest stages of development for the film, Shredder was reimagined as \"Colonel Schrader\", the military leader of the [[black-ops]] unit \"The Foot\", revealed later in the script to be a yellow-skinned, red-eyed alien with the ability to sprout spikes.<ref>{{cite web|author=Jamie Frevele at 11:18 am Wed, Aug 29, 2012 |url=http://boingboing.net/2012/08/29/leaked-ninja-turtles-script.html |title=The internet uncovers the horrible Ninja Turtles bullet we all dodged |publisher=Boing Boing |date=2012-08-29 |accessdate=2014-05-08}}</ref> This idea was dropped after [[Evan Daugherty]] was hired to rewrite the script in early 2013.<ref>[http://deadline.com/2013/02/teenage-mutant-ninja-turtles-release-pushed-to-june-6-2014/ 'Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles' Release Pushed To June 6, 2014] Retrieved July 2, 2013</ref>\n\nIn the film, Shredder is the leader of the Foot Clan, who is terrorizing [[New York City]]. After a [[Raphael (Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles)|vigilante]] stops the Foot Clan, Shredder orders the Foot to take hostages down the subway in order to lure the vigilante out. Later in the film, Shredder's adopted son, Eric Sacks, informs Shredder that the vigilante is in fact four mutated Turtles who are test subjects of Project Renaissance, a science experiment of April O'Neil's late father. Sacks gives Shredder an armed suit and a helmet, the latter and the Foot Clan attack the Turtles' lair, where he defeats [[Splinter (Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles)|Splinter]] and kidnaps three Turtles after Raphael was presumed dead. Sacks drains the Turtles' blood in order to create mutagen so that he can complete his and Shredder's plan: the latter will release a virus across the city and Sacks will sell the mutagen as a cure for the disease, making him even richer. As Shredder prepares to release the virus, the Turtles escape and confront him. Although he nearly defeats them, the Turtles were able to conquer Shredder with the help of April, which causes him to fall from the building on which he stood, but he survives and is shown to have a sample of the mutagen.\n\n===''Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Out of the Shadows'' (2016)===\n[[Brian Tee]] portrayed Shredder in the 2016 film, ''[[Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Out of the Shadows]]''. In the beginning of the movie, the Foot Clan, led by a scientist named [[Baxter Stockman]], attempt to help Shredder escape from prison. Although the turtles try to prevent the escape, Stockman was able to help Shredder escape using a teleportation device. But Shredder is hijacked mid-teleport and ends up in a place called [[Dimension X (Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles)|Dimension X]]. There, he meets [[Krang]], who gives Shredder a mutagen canister in exchange for a promise to find the three components of a machine that Krang sent to [[Earth]] long ago, which when united will open a portal to his dimension. Shredder returns to New York City and recruits two criminals named Bebop and Rocksteady and has Stockman use Krang's mutagen to transform them to powerful animal mutants- a warthog and rhinoceros. Shredder, Bebop and Rocksteady find the components in a museum in New York and in a jungle in [[Brazil]]. Shredder and Stockman unite the components, creating a portal to Krang's dimension. Shredder betrays Stockman and has his men take him away, but upon entering the [[Technodrome]], Krang immediately betrays Shredder, freezing him and locking him away with his collection of other defeated foes.\n\n===''Batman vs. Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles''===\nAndrew Kishino voices Shredder in the [[crossover (fiction)|crossover]] animated film, ''[[Batman vs. Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles]]''. In the film, Shredder allies his forces with [[Ra's al Ghul]] and the [[League of Assassins]] to build a machine designed to transform [[Gotham City|Gotham]]'s citizens into unhinged mutants. In exchange for his assistance, Ra's promises Shredder access to one of his Lazarus Pits, which would grant him eternal life. When he and the Foot Clan try to steal a cloud seeder from [[Wayne Enterprises]], he ends up fighting Batman and barely comes out victorious after using an ancient technique. \n\nLater, he fights [[Batman]] once more when the Turtles and the Bat Family arrive at Ace Chemicals to stop him and Ra's from activating the machine. Though he gains the upper hand on the Dark Knight once again, he is thrown off when Batman says \"Cowabunga\" and gains assistance from Raphael. After Michaelangelo and Donatello destroy the machine, the debris sends him into a vat of chemicals as the plant explodes. In the post-credits scene, he is revealed to have survived the explosion and now strongly resembles [[the Joker]].\n\n==Video games==\nAs the original [[List of Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles video games|''TMNT'' video games]] are mostly based on the 1987 cartoon, Shredder is often based on his first cartoon incarnation. He usually executes some plan to provoke the Turtles into retaliating and defeat them; these include kidnapping April O'Neil and stealing the [[Statue of Liberty]]. Shredder is usually the last boss in the games.\n*''[[Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles (NES game)|''Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles]]'' ([[NES]], 1989): Shredder is the final boss. He is found at the end of the Technodrome level. He causes the Turtles to lose roughly half their energy if he touches them, and has a gun that can de-mutate them, which instantly kills them. He wears a red costume like in the Mirage comics.\n*''[[Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles (arcade game)|Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles]]'' ([[Arcade game|arcade]], 1989): Once again, Shredder is the final boss and is found at the end of the Technodrome level. He is armed with a sword, and has the ability to clone himself (the exact number of clones is one more than the number of Turtles attacking him in the arcade version). Shredder and his clones also have the ability to shoot lightning bolts from a device on the helmet, which de-mutate the Turtles they hit, killing them. When Shredder or one of his clones is close to death, his helmet falls off, a unique occurrence in the game series.\n*''[[Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Fall of the Foot Clan]]'' (1990): This game was the first one not to feature Shredder as the final boss. Instead, Shredder is the boss of the penultimate stage, which is set in a river. It is also the first game in which Shredder does not have the ability to de-mutate the Turtles. His only attack is a sword swipe, but he can teleport if hit. The final boss is Krang.\n*''[[Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: The Manhattan Missions]]'' (1991): In this [[PC game]], Shredder fights the turtles in his Manhattan hideout, decorated in a Japanese style. His appearance is based on the Mirage comic version.\n*''[[Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles III: The Manhattan Project]]'' (1992): This game is the first to feature both a battle against Shredder and a second one against a mutated Super Shredder. The first battle takes place at the end of the Technodrome level, which is the sixth of the eight levels of the game. In this battle, Shredder uses a sword to attack the Turtles. Shredder later returns as the final boss of the game, on the stage set in Krang's spacecraft. This time, he mutates himself into Super Shredder, much as he did in the second movie which had been released earlier the same year (1991). Super Shredder has two superpowers, the ability to call down lightning, and the ability to shoot fireballs. These fireballs can de-mutate the Turtles, but unlike other games, this is not an instant kill.\n*''[[Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles II: Back from the Sewers]]'' (1991): A sequel to ''Fall of the Foot Clan'', this game also features Shredder as a regular level boss and Krang as the final boss. He does not have the ability to de-mutate the Turtles, but he does have a wider variety of attacks than in the previous [[Game Boy]] game. Shredder returns later in his mutated Super Shredder form, as a sub-level boss of the final Technodrome level. However, in this incarnation, his only super-power is the ability to teleport elsewhere on the screen. He attacks the Turtles using a sword.\n*''[[Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Turtles in Time]]'' (1991): Shredder is again the final boss of the game, and found in the Technodrome. However, this time, he is not preceded by a Technodrome level. Instead, the Turtles fight through a Starbase level in the future (2100 AD) with Krang as boss, then teleport to the Technodrome in the present (1991 in the arcade game and 1992 in the [[SNES]] version) for the final confrontation. Shredder attacks with a sword, and can fire energy attacks. In the SNES port of the game, Shredder begins the battle by mutating himself into Super Shredder, and has the added superpowers of super-speed movement, fire ground attacks, ice air attacks, and a de-mutating fire ball which costs a turtle a life. The SNES port also added a Technodrome level earlier in the game, which leads to a battle with a regular Shredder. In this battle, Shredder is in a kind of battletank, armed with a machine gun and claws. The player views the action over Shredder's shoulder inside the tank, and the only way to cause damage is to hurl the never-ending waves of Foot Soldiers toward the screen and into the tank.\n*''[[Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: The Hyperstone Heist]]'' (1992): This game uses a Super Shredder similar to the one in ''Turtles in Time''. His attacks are roughly the same.\n*''[[Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles III: Radical Rescue]]'' (1993): Unlike its two predecessors, ''Fall of the Foot Clan'' and ''Back from the Sewers'', this game does feature Shredder as the final boss. However, this time Shredder has become Cyber Shredder, half-man and half-machine. This form of Shredder possessed deadly kick moves and energy ball attacks, as well as being the only boss in the game with two life meters, as the meter instantly refills after it is drained the first time.\n\n[[File:Shredder villain SNES.gif|thumb|Shredder in the SNES version of ''Tournament Fighters'']]\n*''[[Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Tournament Fighters]]'' (1993): This is the first game in which Shredder is not a boss but instead a regular playable character. Furthermore, his costume is based on the Mirage comics version. Finally, in the SNES incarnation of this game, he appears under the name Cyber-Shredder, but there is no indication that he has become a cybernetic being as in ''Radical Rescue''.\n\nAfter a 10-year hiatus, a new series of ''TMNT'' games was initiated. These new games are based on the 2003 cartoon series, and likewise, Shredder in the games is the same as in the cartoon.\n*''[[Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles (2003 video game)|Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles]]'' (2003): Shredder appears as the final boss. The Turtles face him on the helicarrier at the top of the Foot Helicarriers; he wields the Sword of Tengu in this fight. Shredder's combo attacks are quick and nearly continuous. When half of his health bar has been depleted, his attacks become much faster. There is also a secret final boss in which the player faces Shredder as Oroku Saki. His combos are much quicker and deadlier, and he also has a temporary powered-up state.\n*''[[Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles 2: Battle Nexus]]'' (2004): The game begins a short while before the end of the previous game, and Shredder is encountered by the Turtles in the second stage of the game; however, he is not fought by the player, only in a cutscene. As in the cartoon, Shredder is defeated, but he survives the assault on his headquarters. Shredder resurfaces in the TCRI building later on, but once again, the player does not directly fight him; the main goal of the mission being to evacuate the Utroms back to their home planet. He is seemingly killed in the destruction of the TCRI building, but he once again survives. In a sub-plot exclusive to the game, he is detailed as being a mass murderer of Utroms on their homeworld, and he gave Utrom mercenary Slashurr a permanent scar. He later wiped Slashurr's memory, and employed him to kill the Turtles. However, Slashurr eventually remembers his past, and with the Turtles, battles Shredder and the Foot on his ship. The Turtles eventually defeat Shredder once again. In the Battle Nexus fighting tournament mode, Shredder appears as the final boss of the Foot Fight tournament, though the nature of these tournaments when it comes to the game's canon is questionable.\n*''[[Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Melee]]'' (2005): Shredder appeared as a playable character and opponent in three forms\u2014his standard armor, without the armor (as Oroku Saki), and a golden \"Mega\" Shredder.\n*''[[Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles 3: Mutant Nightmare]]'' (2005) The third chapter of the game, \"Exodus\", deals directly with the Turtles thwarting the Foot's efforts. As in the third-season finale, the Turtles and Splinter battle the Foot at their headquarters, and follow the Shredder aboard his starship. They nearly sacrifice themselves to kill Shredder as well, but the Utroms rescue them, and exile Shredder to a distant ice asteroid forever. Shredder is also encountered in the dark future as one of the final bosses of the Nightmare chapter of the game.\n*''[[TMNT (video game)|TMNT]]'' (2007): In the console versions of the 2007 movie-based game, Shredder appears as a boss in a flashback-within-a-flashback (as the events of the game are told to Splinter after their occurrence). The armor of Shredder in this game is based on the 2003 cartoon series version.\n*''[[Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Smash-Up|TMNT: Smash Up]]'' (2009): Shredder is a playable character in the [[PlayStation 2|PS2]] and [[Wii]] fighting game. He appears in both his Utrom Shredder and Cyber Shredder forms.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://wii.ign.com/dor/objects/14305526/teenage-mutant-ninja-turtles-smash-up/images/teenage-mutant-ninja-turtles-smash-up-20090819101955472.html |title=IGN: Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Smash-Up Screenshots (Wii) 2966717 |publisher=Wii.ign.com |date= |accessdate=2014-05-08}}</ref>\n*''[[Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Out of the Shadows (video game)|Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Out of the Shadows]]'' (2013): Shredder appears as both the penultimate and final boss of the game. He recruits Baxter Stockman to build a new helmet for him using stolen Krang technology, which gives him [[Psychokinesis|telekinetic]] powers, including the ability to fly. Shredder is first fought in his lair when the Turtles come to save April and learn about his scheme. After escaping, he is fought again in the Krangs's secret undergroung facility, this time donning his new helmet built by Stockman. He is ultimately defeated by the Turtles, who destroy his helmet, leaving him to swear revenge.\n*''[[Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles (2014 film)|Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles]]'' (2014): The [[Nintendo 3DS]] game based on the 2014 film, Shredder, who is actually Eric Sacks, appears as the final boss. However, after defeating him, it is revealed that it was all an illusion created by Baxter Stockman, to allow the real Shredder to escape.\n\n==Other appearances==\nIn the anime adaptation ''[[Mutant Turtles: Choujin Densetsu-hen]]'', the backstory from the original cartoon was preserved. Unlike the rest of the main cast, Shredder's appearance was changed to match the ''Supermutants'' Shredder toy that was being sold at that time. The manga explained this by saying his original outfit was destroyed in a battle with the Turtles and Krang created the new armor for him. Shredder also gains the ability to transform into the dragon Devil Shredder using the Mutanite crystals he stole from the Neutrinos. With the energy from the evil [[Sprite (creature)|sprite]] Dark Mu, he was later able to transform into the gigantic Dark Devil Shredder. In the second volume of the anime he gets his Tiger Spirit ''Metal Mutant'' armor. He was voiced by [[Kiyoyuki Yanada]].\n\nShredder also made a guest appearance in an episode of the hit YouTube show ''[[Death Battle]]''. In the episode, his weapons and abilities were analyzed against ''[[X-Men]]'' villain [[Silver Samurai]].

This shogun appears in the [[Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles]] [[Comic book|comics]] and all of its related media.<ref name=\"nytimes\"/> In every incarnation of the ''TMNT'' franchise, he is depicted as the leader of the criminal organization known as the [[Foot Clan]], and serves as the [[main antagonist]] and [[archenemy]] of the Turtles and [[Splinter (Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles)|Splinter]].\n\nIn 2009, The Shredder was ranked as [[IGN]]'s 39th-greatest comic book villain of all time.\n{{TOC limit|3}}\n\n==Design==\nShredder's physical appearance remains fairly consistent in most incarnations of the character. Saki is a muscular Japanese man, most frequently seen in \"the Shredder\" persona, wearing a suit of armor vaguely based on that of a [[samurai]], sometimes with a cape. The armor consists of blade-covered metal plaques on his shoulders, forearms, hands (sometimes just his left hand, because he is left-handed), and shins; he wears a purple, gray, blue, or red robe that variously appears to be simple fabric or a form of [[chain mail]]. He also tends to wear a metal [[kabuto|helmet]] with a trident-shaped ornament on top, and a metal ninja style mask which covers his face, leaving only his eyes visible. In the 2003 TMNT series, the Shredder is a red alien Utrom named Ch'rell, who utilized an indestructible exo-suit to disguise himself as a human named Oroku Saki.\n\n[[Kevin Eastman]] got the idea for Shredder's armor from large trapezoidal cheese [[grater]]s which he envisioned on a villainous character's<ref>{{cite web|url=http://listverse.com/2014/08/16/10-strangest-facts-about-the-teenage-mutant-ninja-turtles/|title=10 Strangest Facts About The Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles|publisher=Listverse|language=English|author=Chris Jenkins|date=16 August 2014|accessdate=21 January 2017}}</ref> (originally named \"The Grater\" or \"Grate Man\") arms.

Yes, he was an important part of their history, and they probably would not have come into existence without his involvement in their world (or more accurately Splinter's world)... but that's about it.

He quickly became one of their deadliest warriors and rose up the ranks and was chosen to lead the Foot's American branch. Operating in New York under the name of The Shredder, Saki used the opportunity to avenge his brother by killing Yoshi and Shen. Under Saki's leadership, the Foot participated in variety of criminal activities, including [[drug smuggling]], [[Arms trafficking|arms running]], and assassination.\n\nThirteen years later Saki was challenged by the Ninja Turtles, who were the result of an accident exposing four ordinary turtles to radioactive waste. They were trained by Yoshi's pet rat Splinter, who had also been mutated by the same substance, to avenge his former master. After a lengthy rooftop battle where Saki seemed to be winning, [[Leonardo (Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles)|Leonardo]] managed to plunge his sword through Saki's torso. Defeated, he was offered the opportunity to commit [[seppuku]] (ritual suicide), but Shredder refused and detonated a [[thermite]] grenade, in an attempt to take their lives as well along his. But at the last second, [[Donatello (Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles)|Donatello]] used his [[B\u014d|bo]] to knock Shredder off the building to his death.\n\nHowever, it was not yet the end of the Shredder. He returned on Christmas Eve seemingly resurrected with an army of Foot Ninjas severely beating Leonardo and burning down the apartment of the turtles' ally [[April O'Neil]], forcing them to go into hiding outside the city. A year later, in the story \"Return to New York\", the Turtles returned to settle the score with the Shredder. Leonardo faced off against Oroku Saki alone, during which Saki revealed he was brought back to life by a technique using worms feeding on his body and recreating his cells to reform his body. In the battle, Leonardo [[decapitate]]s the villain, finally killing him, and the four turtles burn his body at the [[Hudson River]]. In the Zulli's trilogy in issues 31, 35, and 36, Shredder attacks the turtles and Splinter before being defeated. Shredder also appears in the dream of Donatello in Volume 4 where he is shown fighting him.\n\nOroku Saki appears briefly in the image comics issue 3 of TMNT and the female ninja Pimiko from the comic book series' Volume 3<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.comicvine.com/pimiko/29-49933/ |title=Pimiko (comic book character) |publisher=Comicvine.com |date= |accessdate=2014-05-08}}</ref> claims to be Shredder's daughter.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.miragelicensing.com/comics/image/05/05.html |title=Image Comics' TMNT \"Volume 3\" #5 |publisher=Miragelicensing.com |date= |accessdate=2014-05-08}}</ref>\n\n==== ''Tales of the TMNT'' ====\nIn the second volume of the anthology series ''[[Tales of the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles]]'' story \"Worms of Madness\" it is shown that a few weeks after the events of their final battle the Shredder had yet another resurrection of sorts when a Foot mystic reactivated the worms; however, the mystic did not resurrect Saki himself but the worm colony which had gained sentience and retained Saki's memories and believing itself to be Saki. The worms then went out to find a new body and chose that of a shark. After the Foot Kidnapped Splinter, the turtles managed to engage the \"Shredder-Shark\" in battle and defeating it by severing its connection to the mystic and the creature realizing that it was not the real Saki.\n\nThe \"Shredder-Shark\" returned once more kidnapping Casey's adopted daughter Shadow to lure the Turtles into a trap. With the Turtles away, it was up to Casey and Splinter to defeat it and rescue Shadow, finally killing the creature.\n\n====Other versions of the Shredder====\nThroughout a considerable part of the Image comic series, [[Raphael (TMNT)|Raphael]] tries to impersonate Shredder by wearing his armor. Following this, he is accepted as the leader of the Foot Clan. In later issues of the series, a mysterious '''Lady Shredder''' appears to challenge Raphael. Although the book was canceled before her identity could be revealed, writer [[Gary Carlson]] confirmed after the fact that she was meant to be [[Karai (character)|Karai]].{{Citation needed|date=October 2007}}\n\nIn Volume Four series, [[Leonardo (Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles)|Leonardo]] encounters '''Oroku Yoshi''', a Battle Nexus contestant wearing armor almost identical to that of the second animated series' Shredder. His connection to Oroku Saki and the Foot is not known, since the bi-monthly comic was ultimately cancelled in 2010. In issue 32 he was called to meet a mysterious individual who asks to bring Leo with him as well.\n\nAnother Version called Doctor Shreddarius also appears in a reality where the turtles are superheroes.\n\n===Archie Comics===\nThe [[Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles (Archie Comics)|Archie Comics' series]] use the same background as the 1987 cartoon, as the first issues are identical. Later in the Archie comics, Shredder travels to the future and works with Armaggon and Verminator X to offset the skill and experience of the future versions of the Turtles.\n\nThis version of the character was more in line with the early episodes' depiction of the character as a cunning adversary and in many issues nearly proves to be a lethal enemy, coming close to defeating the turtles on a number of occasions, and even aids Armaggon and Verminator X in the defeat and capture of two of the turtles in the future. His final fate within the Archie comics series remains unknown, though a three-part mini-series put out by Archie comics after the end of their regular comic series seems to indicate he remains a consistent foe to the turtles for many years, briefly restoring Splinter to the form of Hamato Yoshi and also undoing Michaelangelo's mutation, though both later revert to mutant status by the end of the story, while Shredder was left in a vegetative state in the aftermath of his final battle with the Turtles.\n\n===IDW Publishing===\nIn feudal Japan, Oroku Saki was a high-ranking member of the Foot Clan along with Hamato Yoshi.

After the Turtles rescue Leonardo, Shredder calls a meeting with Krang and proposes an alliance in exchange for Utrom technologies, which Krang rejects. A short battle results in retreat on both sides and the revelation that Shredder had stolen some Utrom resources from Krang's compound to begin creating a mutant army (in the form of Bebop, Rocksteady, Koya and Bludgeon).<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\nIn Issue #50, Shredder faced Splinter and the turtles in a final battle which he lost and briefly admitted his faults and also making Karai the new head of the Foot Clan. He was then killed by Splinter by having his sword slashed into the back of his head, killing him instantly.\nAfter his death Shredder's body is kept in a crypt that is guarded by Jennika who was assigned by Hamato Yoshi in order to learn humility. Shredder's tomb is eventually desecrated by the witch Kitsune who plans to revive Oroku Saki in order to restore order to the Foot Clan but Splinter knew this and keeps the skull to foil her attempts. \n\nShredder will appear in the upcoming miniseries ''Shredder in Hell''. In the mini series Shredder is in the afterlife and descends into the underworld trying to find the truth of his own soul meanwhile Kitsune uses his corpse to summon her father as his host. Shredder also fought his past life Takeshi Tasuo in his inner conflict until Splinter/Hamato Yoshi later shows up to help him against the forces of Hell.\n\n==Television==\n===1987 animated series===\n[[File:TMNT1987 Shredder.png|thumb|Shredder in the 1987 animated series]]\n\nIn the [[Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles (1987 TV series)|1987 animated series]], Oroku Saki and Hamato Yoshi were both members of the Foot Clan in Japan. After Saki framed him for the attempted murder of a visiting [[sensei]], Yoshi was forced to [[exile]] himself to [[New York City]], where he lived in the sewers with four pet turtles that were accidentally dropped down a storm drain.\n\nIn the following years, Saki took leadership of the Foot Clan, and took on his Shredder persona. He also met a trans-dimensional alien called [[Krang]], and used the advanced technology at his disposal to replace the Foot Ninja with robots called the Foot Soldiers. He secretly moved to New York, where he found Yoshi still alive. In an attempt to kill his old foe, Shredder dumped mutagen in the sewers. This mutates Yoshi into Splinter, and he starts training the also mutated Turtles in [[ninjutsu]].\n\nShredder was voiced by [[James Avery]] for seasons one to seven and [[William E. Martin]] for seasons eight and ten, with the alternates being [[Dorian Harewood]] and [[Pat Fraley]] in 1989, [[Jim Cummings]] in 1991\u20131993 and [[Townsend Coleman]] in 1993. In the 2009 crossover movie ''[[Turtles Forever]]'', this incarnation of the Shredder was voiced by Load Williams. In the 2012 series, the 1987 version of the Shredder is voiced by [[Kevin Michael Richardson]].\n\n====Depiction====\nIn his early appearances, Shredder was presented as extremely cunning and was described by Splinter himself as the most dangerous adversary he ever faced. Shredder's intelligence persevered throughout his various portrayals, and in several instances it is claimed that Shredder has an IQ of 300. As the 1987 cartoon series was more light-hearted than the comics, Shredder was later depicted as an evil but a villain that always fails rather than the dire and lethal ninja he was originally shown to be. He and Krang are constantly bickering about tactics and often take pleasure in the other's failings (and sometimes intentionally sabotage each other). His two henchmen [[Bebop and Rocksteady]] are especially incompetent and fail miserably at everything they do. They were mostly used for [[comic relief]] in the show; however, the Turtles certainly consider them to be formidable (despite their inane stupidity) in combat due to their great strength and endurance, and as such, often use their intelligence to outwit them.\n\nDespite Shredder's failings, he is still shown to have considerable skills. In martial arts, he is often shown to surpass the Turtles and to be equaled only by Splinter. Nevertheless, he usually runs away from a fight when outnumbered, incapacitating the Turtles to defeat them in combat; as the series progressed, however, the Turtles were able to battle him on more equal grounds and even defeat him in combat on several occasions. He trained the Punk Frogs in a very short period of time to be a match for the Turtles, but the Punk Frogs soon switch sides. His technical skills are also quite impressive: he designed and built a robotic body for Krang, prepared the mutagen mixture, knew how Krang's teleportation engine worked, and built numerous other advanced devices. Ironically in one episode \"Shredderville\" the Turtles dream they find themselves in a [[parallel universe (fiction)|mirror universe]] where the TMNT ''never existed'' and Shredder rules New York City, yet finds the task of ruling so burdensome that he has a nervous breakdown.\n\nFrom mid season seven onwards, Shredder was depicted as a more serious threat, full of anger and bloodlust, though he was still easily defeated by the Turtles. His friendship with Krang also appeared to have grown. There were many times that Shredder could have just left Krang at the mercy of the Turtles or Lord Dregg, but he always rescued him, and went as far as to donate his life energy to save him.\n\n====Family====\nShredder's family is presented in three episodes. In the episode \"Shredder's Mom\",<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ninjaturtles.com/cartoon/guide/cart070.htm |title=TMNT Cartoon Episode 70! |publisher=Ninjaturtles.com |accessdate=2014-05-08 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110605021820/http://www.ninjaturtles.com/cartoon/guide/cart070.htm |archivedate=2011-06-05 }}</ref> Shredder's mother Miyoko helps Shredder and Krang in an attempt to destroy the world's climate. In this episode, Miyoko first learns of her son's criminal activities, and proves herself to be as villainous. However, she constantly treats Shredder like a baby, until he gets fed up with it and transports her back to her retirement home. In the episode \"My Brother, the Bad Guy\",<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ninjaturtles.com/cartoon/guide/cart108.htm |title=TMNT Cartoon Episode 108! |publisher=Ninjaturtles.com |accessdate=2014-05-08 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120210071625/http://www.ninjaturtles.com/cartoon/guide/cart108.htm |archivedate=2012-02-10 }}</ref> it is revealed that Oroku Saki has a younger brother, Kazuo who works as a police lieutenant in [[Tokyo]]. Kazuo and the Turtles try to join forces to stop one of Shredder's plans, but his fervent respect of the law clashes with the Turtles' \"whatever it takes\" attitude. Finally, the episode \"The Legend of Koji\"<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ninjaturtles.com/cartoon/guide/cart159.htm |title=TMNT Cartoon Episode 159! |publisher=Ninjaturtles.com |accessdate=2014-05-08 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120204035507/http://www.ninjaturtles.com/cartoon/guide/cart159.htm |archivedate=2012-02-04 }}</ref> features Saki's distant ancestor Oroku Sancho, who lived in Japan in 1583. He is the leader of a small clan, and every bit as wicked as his descendant. When Shredder offers to help him find magical relics that would provide him with power and wealth, Sancho takes Shredder's information, then betrays him and orders his men to kill him. However, Sancho is also a coward, and when he breaks down in the face of danger, his men abandon him.\n\nThis family tree leads to a bit of confusion regarding whether Shredder's given name is Oroku and his last name Saki (as indicated by the fact his brother shares the name Saki), or the other way around (as indicated by the fact his ancestor's last name is Oroku). This question is never resolved on the show, although Mirage comics adds more evidence for Oroku being the family name; Saki's brother is \"Oroku Nagi\". This follows Japanese naming conventions, which place the family name before an individual's given name.\n\n====Timeline====\nCounting from the first meeting with the Turtles, Shredder spent eight seasons plotting ways to defeat them. In the season 8 episode \"Turtle Trek\",<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ninjaturtles.com/cartoon/guide/cart178.htm |title=TMNT Cartoon Episode 178! |publisher=Ninjaturtles.com |accessdate=2014-05-08 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120210071629/http://www.ninjaturtles.com/cartoon/guide/cart178.htm |archivedate=2012-02-10 }}</ref> the Turtles destroy the engines of the [[Technodrome]], trapping it and its inhabitants in [[Dimension X (Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles)|Dimension X]] for good and putting an end to Shredder's plans.

Shredder is nowhere to be seen, but it is assumed that he is still somewhere in Dimension X.\n\nHe and Krang also appear in ''[[Turtles Forever]]'', with the Technodrome still under New York City before being sent into the 2003 universe. However, Shredder and Krang's incompetence (as well as their relative sanity) is fully shown when the Utrom Shredder of the 2003 universe seizes command of the Technodrome and adds Utrom technology to the powerful war machine, and turns it against the world. In the climax, Shredder temporarily overcomes his hatred for the Turtles as both he and Krang decide to help the Turtles defeat the Utrom Shredder who they realise is totally insane, will kill everyone and has effectively stolen the Technodrome from them. Shredder also takes extreme offense at being considered inferior by his other dimensional counterpart, doesn't see the point of destroying the entire universe and doesn't understand why the Utrom Shredder won't just kill the Turtles when he had the chance. So, with Krang, he chooses to fight alongside the Turtles against their common foe.\n\n===''The Next Mutation''===\nIn ''[[Ninja Turtles: The Next Mutation]]'', Shredder (portrayed by Patrick Pon, voiced by [[Doug Parker (voice actor)|Doug Parker]]) is still the Turtles' sworn enemy. This time, however, Venus uses her powers to make the Oroku Saki from within take control of Shredder's mind. After the Foot Clan disbands, he ends up living on the streets. Later, the Dragon Lord's rank warriors attack him to get a medallion that was in his possession. Splinter saves him and takes him to the Turtles' lair to protect him. It was hinted that Shredder might possibly go back to his old ways, but the show was canceled soon after that episode.\n\nIn the show, Shredder wore a general attire similar to the one he wore in the second film, but with a heavily altered helmet/mask due to the lesser budget for the TV series as compared to the movies, which had allowed for more detailed props and costume pieces. Shredder appeared only a few times in the show, due to the primary villain of the series being a draconic being from another dimension and thus supplanted Shredder as the Turtles' nemesis.\n\n===2003 animated series===\nNumerous individuals have assumed the \"'''Shredder'''\" mantle in the [[Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles (2003 TV series)|2003 animated series]], all of whom, except for Karai, are voiced by [[Scott Rayow|Scottie Ray]]. In the episode \"Tempus Fugit\", a possible future is shown in which the Utrom Shredder, Tengu Shredder, and Cyber Shredder are engaged in a war for control of New York City.\n\n====Utrom Shredder====\n[[File:TMNTCh'rell.png|thumb|The Shredder's armor is penetrated, revealing his true Utrom form]]\nThe Utrom Shredder is the main antagonist and primary Shredder of the series. He is the archenemy of the Turtles and Splinter, and indirectly had a hand in their creation. Utrom Shredder serves as the main antagonist of the first three seasons of the show as well as the finale film Turtles Forever. His digital copy also serves as the antagonist of the seventh and final season.\n\nAfter causing the deaths of millions across the universe, the psychopathic alien warlord Ch'rell (whose aliases include Torrinon, Kako Naso, and Duke Acureds) was captured by his fellow Utrom and being transported back to his home world to answer for his crimes. However, Ch'rell managed to escape captivity and sabotaged the Utrom ship, causing it to crash-land on Earth during the Sengoku period of feudal Japan. Stranded on the then-primitive planet, the Utrom were forced to wait for centuries until human technology advanced enough for them to develop a teleportation device and return home. They thus developed humanoid exo-suits to hide amongst the humans, and Ch'rell stole the first working prototype and used the Japanese legend of a Demon Tengu to craft a dual identity, becoming a wealthy Japanese philanthropist named Oroku Saki while secretly operating as the crime lord known as the Shredder. Saki soon founded the Foot Clan, which grew into a massive underground criminal empire by the 20th century. He eventually adopts an abandoned girl named [[Karai (Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles)|Karai]], whom he personally trained in the arts of ninjutsu to lead the Foot Clan in Japan while he operated in New York City. In New York, the Shredder captures Hamato Yoshi, one of the Utroms' foremost guardians, and kills him after he refuses to reveal their location. Yoshi's pet rat [[Splinter (Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles)|Splinter]] witnesses his murder and escapes, winding up in the city's sewers where he and four baby turtles are accidentally exposed to a mutagenic ooze created by the Utroms, transforming them into sentient humanoid lifeforms.\n\nIn the first season set over a decade later, the Turtles begin encountering the Foot Clan and unknowingly foiling several of the Shredder's operations. Oroku Saki becomes intrigued with the Turtles, wanting to meet them and hoping to bring them to his side. One day, he invites [[Leonardo]] to his home and offers him to join the Foot. The Turtles consult their master Splinter, who reveals his true nature by telling them of Master Yoshi's murder. The Shredder eventually becomes the greatest enemy of the Turtles when they decline his offer. During their first engagement, the Shredder proves himself to be more skilled than the Turtles, compelling them to flee and hide. While Shredder and his Foot Ninja search for the Turtles, Splinter finds and regroups them, and plans a counterattack. In a subsequent battle on the rooftops, the Shredder outmatches the Turtles again, but Splinter tricks him into cutting the support for a water tower, which is kicked onto him. The water sweeps Shredder off the building, and the tower collapses to the ground, crushing him. But a few scenes later, Shredder's hand is shown to emerge from the wreckage of the water tower.\n\nSplinter and the Turtles were unaware of the Shredder's survival until months later, on one day when Leonardo goes on an outdoor morning training exercise, only to be ambushed by the Foot Clan. The Shredder's four Elite Guard beat Leonardo close to death and send him flying into a window of [[April O'Neil]]'s antique shop apartment, where the Turtles were staying after Foot Ninjas had marauded their sewer home while they were away. Soon afterwards, the Shredder leads an assault on April's shop. Overpowered and outnumbered, the Turtles, Splinter, April and [[Casey Jones (Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles)|Casey Jones]] are forced to run off into retreat in a walk-in cooler. The Shredder then bars the door, drops a firebomb and punctures a gas pipe with his gauntlets. Fortunately, April remembers that the motor used to power the cooler was removed, leaving a hole in the exterior wall that leads outside. As a result, the Turtles and their allies are able to evacuate the building before it burns down. They retreat to Casey's grandmother's farmhouse in [[Northampton, Massachusetts]], where they would spend the next three months recuperating.\n\nDuring this time, they are presumed dead by the Foot, but Oroku Saki sends the clan's mad scientist [[Baxter Stockman]] the task of confirming their deaths. Although Stockman finds no proof that the Turtles died, he creates false evidence to convince the Shredder and succeeds in doing so. When Leonardo is completely healed from his injuries, the Turtles and Splinter return to New York to face the Shredder once more. They launch a surprise assault on the Foot headquarters, fighting their way through Shredder's minions and eventually reaching his throne. By the end of the battle, an epic standoff between Leonardo and the Shredder occurs. Armed with the Sword of Tengu, the former decapitates the latter when they strike each other in one final clash. Not knowing that the Shredder is an Utrom, the Turtles believe him to be finally killed for good. After they leave, the Shredder is seen to be getting up and walking away carrying his severed head.\n\nIn the second season, Ch'rell seeks to exact revenge on his species. He and his henchmen infiltrate the TCRI facility, where the Utroms' base is located, and coincidentally encounter the Turtles and Master Splinter. When the Shredder is zapped into unconsciousness, a time bomb slips out of his hands, set to detonate in ten minutes. The Turtles help the Utroms escape using the Transmat, a teleportation device, which [[Donatello (Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles)|Donatello]] activates. After the Utroms teleport back to their homeworld, the Shredder awakens and attacks the Turtles. In the ensuing fight, the Turtles use their weapons to penetrate his armor, which is then electrocuted by Donatello, disabling it. Afterwards, the Shredder reveals his Utrom form to the Turtles, intent on taking down his enemies with him. But at the last few seconds, Donatello manages to power up the Transmat, through which he, his brothers and Splinter escape before the TCRI building implodes with Ch'rell inside of it.\n\nWith his supposed demise, the Foot Clan (led by the Elite Guard), the Purple Dragons and the New York Mafia clash with each other for control of New York City. Unknown to them, the Shredder had survived once more and was retrieved by his daughter Karai, now being placed in a stasis tube and healed by worms inside a secret medical facility of the Foot headquarters. During his recuperation, Karai assumes leadership of the Foot Clan and makes peace with the Turtles after they help her end the turf war. But once the Shredder is fully recovered, he vows vengeance and breaks off the truce, leaving Karai to question her loyalty. By this point, Baxter Stockman had created the Foot Mechs, mainly in the form of armed ninja robots, but also versions of the U.S. President, the English Prime Minister and Splinter. His plans were again thwarted by the Turtles, when his barge hideout is located by them, Splinter, and their unlikely ally, the delusional Triceraton Zog, leading to another confrontation with the Foot. Aboard the freighter, Donatello programs a bomb set to go off in 30 minutes. The Shredder is defeated again when Zog sacrifices his life by keeping him on his ship when it sinks due to the explosion, but Karai rescues him on a helicopter.\n\nIn the third season, the Triceratons launch an invasion on Earth. In the aftermath of the invasion, New York City is in ruins. In his persona as Oroku Saki, the Shredder uses his fortune to repair the damage and gains favor of its citizens. Secretly, his real purpose of reconstruction was to salvage the remnants of Triceraton technology in order to construct a large starship to return to the stars, and thereby retaliating against the Utrom. He even enlists a young scientist named Dr. Chaplin to help out. The craft is eventually completed, but Ch'rell's plan suffers several complications, courtesy of the Turtles and the Earth Protection Force (led by Agent Bishop). Despite sustaining heavy damage, the ship is launched into orbit, albeit with the Turtles and Splinter on board. When Karai notes that they left their forces on Earth, Ch'rell states that he has allies on other worlds that can help him. Entering a four-armed Shredder exo-suit, Ch'rell easily defeats them all, prompting the Turtles and Splinter to attempt to sacrifice themselves and blow the ship up in a final attempt to stop the Shredder. Luckily, as the starship explodes, Mortu and the Utrom arrive, having placed a stasis field around the entire ship, freezing time, and teleport all its inhabitants to safety. While the Turtles and Splinter are teleported to sick bay and Professor Honeycutt is taken to one of their labs to be placed in a new robot body, Ch'rell, Karai, and Dr. Chaplin are teleported to the brig. On the Utrom homeworld, Ch'rell is placed on trial before the Utrom High Council that is watched by the Turtles, Splinter, and Professor Honeycutt. The Utrom High Council start by mentioning a testimony from Dolphette that Ch'rell willingly launched an attack on the planet Enethone where over 1 million innocent inhabitants perished. Then they bring up Wan-ran Otho's testimony where Ch'rell incited and funded a civil war on the planet Eno II in an effort to mine their raw minerals without restriction. 3,200,000 lives perished. The Utrom High Council then concludes that Ch'rell tried various attempts to take over the Utrom government through an illegal and violent coup. The Utrom High Council found Ch'rell guilty for the chaos and destruction he brought across the universe, and ultimately sentence him to eternal exile on the desolate ice asteroid Mor Gal Tal. Mortu states to everyone present that Karai and Dr. Chaplin will be returned to Earth and handed over to the authorities.\n\nIn the finale film ''[[Turtles Forever]]'', Ch'rell is freed from his exile by his Shredder counterpart from the 1987 series after his frozen body was teleported off of Mor Gal Tal by 1980s Shredder and Krang. Once Karai showed up upon finding out about Ch'rell's return, Ch'rell then takes over the Technodrome and gains a new, more powerful exo-suit. After realigning with a now-mutated Hun, Ch'rell reverse-engineers the mutagen that Hun got to turn a select number of Cyber Foot into Mutant Foot Soldiers and create new Foot Robots that are stronger than the '80s versions. The Ch'rell later uses the Technodrome to view alternate dimensions, realizing that there is an entire multiverse of Ninja Turtles. Locating the Turtles' source planet, Turtle Prime, Ch'rell vows to eliminate every Ninja Turtle in existence by destroying this dimension. The Mirage Turtles, the 1987 Turtles, and the 2003 Turtles team up to defeat Ch'rell, though Karai and Splinter agree that the Shredder will return again as he always does.\n\nIn \"Same As It Never Was\", Donatello is transported to an alternate future in which the Shredder has succeeded in subjugating Earth. By then, Splinter had died protecting his sons and Casey Jones died fighting the Foot Clan. Ch'rell also severed [[Michelangelo (Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles)|Michelangelo]]'s left arm and [[Raphael (Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles)|Raphael]]'s left eye. When Donatello leads a final rebellion against the Shredder's fortress, his Foot forces kill Michelangelo while Karai kills Leonardo and Raphael. April avenges Leonardo and Raphael by using a rocket launcher on Karai, and the Shredder is killed by Donatello with the Tuneller.\n\nIn \"Timing is Everything\", Leonardo and Cody Jones are accidentally sent back in time to the aftermath of the Turtles' first battle with the Shredder. Later, the Shredder and several Foot ninjas are transported to 2105 but are easily defeated by the Turtles' futuristic technology.\n\n====Tengu Shredder====\nThe '''Tengu Shredder''' or the '''Demon Shredder''' serves as the main antagonist of the fifth season. The first Shredder was a Demon Tengu that rose from a hellish pit and terrorized ancient Japan. When on the verge of death, it entered and possessed a human named Oroku Saki, one of Japan's most skilled warriors, but he was eventually defeated by the power of the Ninja Tribunal. His body, helmet, and gauntlet were separated and sealed away to prevent his return. In the 21st century, the Tengu Shredder's five Foot Mystic heralds attempt to resurrect him, forcing the Ninja Tribunal to recruit the Turtles and four human warriors as their Acolytes to defeat. After the Tengu Shredder rises from the dead and conquers New York City, the Turtles recruit Karai's Foot Clan, the Justice Force, the Earth Protection Force, and the Purple Dragons to defeat him. The Tengu Shredder is weakened when Karai drains his power via a mystic link (which connects all who take the mantle of the Shredder), and he is finally destroyed when the Turtles combine their Dragon avatars to summon the spirit of Hamato Yoshi to deliver the final blow.\n\n====Cyber Shredder====\nThe '''Cyber Shredder''' appears as the main antagonist of the seventh and final season, ''Back to the Sewer''. It is revealed that prior to Ch'rell's exile, he created a digital copy of himself in the event that anything happened to his corporeal form and stored this double in a Foot data vault deep within the Internet. This vault's consciousness is later released when the futuristic Viral attempts to access it, giving rise to the Cyber Shredder. While he is initially confined to cyberspace, the Cyber Shredder ultimately manages to escape and become a physical being. During the final episode, the Cyber Shredder leads the Foot Clan to attack April O'Neil and Casey Jones's wedding, and is finally defeated when the Turtles erased him with a de-compiler previously used against Viral.\n\n====Karai====\n'''Karai''' is the adopted daughter of Oroku Saki (Ch'rell), who takes the mantle of the Shredder after her father's exile. After some lesser battles, she doffs the mantle and begins a non-hostile relationship with the Turtles, particularly towards Leonardo.\n\n===2012 animated series===\nThe Shredder appears as the main antagonist of the [[Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles (2012 TV series)|2012 animated series]], voiced by [[Kevin Michael Richardson]].\n\nHis Japanese origins as Oroku Saki and brotherly relationship with Hamato Yoshi is mostly intact, with the Foot Clan and the Hamato Clan being later revealed as having a long-term rivalry before the Hamato family killed the Oroku family, wiped out their entire clan (starting with the destruction of the Foot Clan monastery) and took in the orphaned Saki as their own. Despite being raised as brothers, both Saki and Yoshi eventually became rivals due to the love of Tang Shen, whose decision to marry Yoshi drove Saki to discover his true heritage and turn on his former brother, eventually destroying everything Yoshi held dear, including the lovely Tang Shen (whom he had killed by accident) and the entire Hamato Clan (starting with the destruction of the Hamato Clan monastery, which resulted with Saki's head getting burned scarred and hairless). Blaming Tang Shen's untimely death on Yoshi, Saki returned to his biological family and became the new leader of the newly restored Foot Clan, tutoring ninjutsu students such as world-famous martial artist [[Tokka and Rahzar|Chris Bradford]] and Brazilian street thug Xever Montes, sharing criminal business with business partners such as Russian arms dealer [[Bebop and Rocksteady|Ivan Steranko]], Sicilian mob boss Don Visiozo, and Purple Dragons leader Hun. In addition, he also a pet [[Akita (dog)|akita]] named Hachiko (named after the [[Hachiko|akita of the same name]]) who played a part in Bradford's mutation into Dogpound after Hachiko bit him.\n\nShredder first appeared in the end of \"Rise of the Turtles, Part 2\" where he traveled to New York when he learned that Hamato Yoshi is training his own ninjas after seeing a shuriken with his clan symbol on a [[shuriken]] left behind by the Turtles during a recent fight on a TV news report. Determined to finally end his age-old rival's life, he sent the Foot Clan after the Turtles until he made his first confrontation with the Turtles in person in \"The Gauntlet\", where victory was seemingly in his grasp before he was distracted by the mutating Bradford and Montes. Although Shredder planned to kill former TCRI inventor [[Baxter Stockman]] for interfering with his plans to kill the Turtles in \"MOUSERS Attack\", he changed his mind by commenting on how Stockman's scientific knowledge could be useful to him. Shredder is also Karai's father, as seen in \"New Girl in Town\". However, in \"Showdown\", during Shredder's battle with Splinter, he reveals that in the aftermath of the fight that caused Tang Shen's death, he took Splinter's daughter, Miwa, and raised her as Karai. He has told her that he is her biological father and it was Splinter who killed her mother, as she has sworn revenge ever since. Shredder initially dismissed the Kraang's presence in New York, but after capturing one, decided to ally with them to destroy the Turtles. The partnership seems stable, though it would seem the Shredder still did not fully trust his new allies.\n\nEarly in the second season, in \"Follow the Leader\", he left for Japan to deal with a situation, leaving Karai as the interim leader of his Foot Clan. He ordered her not to attack the Turtles nor make any dealings with the Kraang behind his back, and was livid when his adoptive daughter disobeyed him. He returned in \"The Manhattan Project\", with Tiger Claw, a Japanese circus performer who was mutated into Shredder's deadly assassin and new first lieutenant. Tiger Claw was able to bring Splinter before him, but complication from a Kraang operation in the city and the Turtles' own efforts rob Shredder of his chance to kill his old foe once again. In \"The Wrath of Tiger Claw\", Shredder and Tiger Claw attempted to use Karai to set a trap for the Turtles, but when she saw a photograph of Hamato Yoshi, Tang Shen, and herself as an infant, she realized that the Turtles were telling the truth and sided with them, resulting in her being captured while buying them time to escape Tiger Claw. Shredder still cared about his adoptive daughter, though, as seen in \"The Legend of the Kuro Kabuto\", where he visited her in her cell and explained why he kept everything a secret and hoped that she will one day understand. After his helmet, the titular Kuro Kabuto, was stolen by professional thief [[Bebop and Rocksteady|Anton Zeck]] on behalf of Steranko, Shredder found Zeck's calling card on a glued-down Rahzar and ordered the entire clan before him. Explaining the helmet's history as a special Foot Clan relic, he had the clan hunt for Zeck, sending Fishface with Stockman-Fly and Rahzar with Tiger Claw. Leonardo later confronted Shredder with the Kabuto for a trade and kept him busy long enough for the other Turtles to get to Karai. However, the \"Karai\" Shredder traded them with turned out to be a dummy rigged with a bomb as the Turtles evaded it. In \"Vengeance is Mine\", Shredder attempted to use the real Karai as bait for a trap that would mutate the Turtles into snakes that would kill Splinter, but the plan backfired when Karai was exposed to the mutagen, turning into a snake and almost attacking Splinter before she fled after regaining control of herself.\n\nIn the two-part second-season finale \"The Invasion\", Shredder and Kraang Prime formed a full alliance in which Shredder and the Foot Clan will help the Kraang take over New York and then the world and in turn the Kraang would return Karai to normal, and deliver Splinter and the Turtles to him. Later, he watched as Leonardo fought and eventually defeated his army of Foot Bots, after which he sent Rahzar, Fishface, and Tiger Claw to take care of him. Leonardo managed to subdue them for a short period of time before Shredder got involved and badly injured Leonardo. Later, Splinter confronted him and the two battled until Splinter got trapped under large metal pipes. Shredder was prepared to kill his rival once and for all; however, [[Leatherhead (TMNT)|Leatherhead]] intervened, and was defeated when Shredder sliced the front of his torso and kicked him of the edge of the dock. Splinter became furious as he broke out from under the pipes and tackled Shredder to the sewers. Later, the Turtles (minus Leonardo) and April watched helplessly from behind metal bars as Shredder defeated Splinter and seemingly killed him by throwing him down a large draining bay.\n\nIn the middle of the third season in \"Return to New York\", tensions began to grow high within the Foot of their alliance with the Kraang, but Shredder convinced everyone that he will keep his promise to take the city back from them. After a feral Splinter was found by the Foot-Bots and taken before him, Shredder had Stockman-Fly work on restoring his memory, which is what April did instead with her Kraang powers when she, the Turtles and Casey Jones returned to the city to rescue their sensei. In \"The Pig and the Rhino\", Shredder sent a now mutated Steranko and Zeck (who are later renamed Bebop and Rocksteady by Michelangelo) to find Karai again, like they did recently before the Turtles helped her escape, or else they'll be given something even more painful than mutation. After the Turtles unknowingly led them to her, the two succeeded in re-capturing Karai (while the Turtles weren't looking) and delivering her back to Shredder, who promised to fix everything he's done to her. The Kraang invasion eventually came to a stop made by the Turtles and the [[Mighty Mutanimals]], but its effects had eventually gave Shredder a gift for his cooperation with the Kraang, which shifted the balance of power within the city's criminal underworld over to the Foot. For him, this was achieved by gaining control of the [[Purple Dragons]] and other Asian gangs through Hun, several South American gangs through Fishface, the [[Russian mafia|Russian mob]] through Rocksteady, and the [[Sicilian mafia|Sicilian mob]] through Vizioso. By using this power, Shredder had these crime groups aid him with collecting various chemicals from a chemical company called Aumen Chemicals, an abandoned Kraang lab and Vizioso for a mind-control serum that he planned to create and use on the Turtles, the Mutanimals, and Karai.\n\nIn the two-part season 3 finale, ''Annihilation: Earth!'' he briefly teams up with Splinter to stop a black hole machine that was to destroy the Earth. He briefly fought the Triceratons until he followed Splinter, double crossing and stabbing him in the back, killing him instantly in front of the turtles. They rushed to Splinter while April blew Shredder away with a blast from her mind. Proclaiming that his victory over Splinter is more important to him than even saving the world, Shredder is sucked into the black hole along with his followers and Splinter while the turtles, April and Casey escape Earth's destruction and then in \"Beyond the Known Universe\", they travel back in time to six months earlier in an effort to prevent this event from happening. In \"Earth's Last Stand\" these events were revisited, but the arrival of the Turtles from the future resulted in Shredder's attempt to murder Splinter being thwarted. The two engaged briefly in battle with Splinter proving victorious, and the unconscious Shredder was carried away by Tiger Claw.\n\nIn \"City at War\" due to the injuries he sustained from Splinter, Shredder has been confined to a hospital bed under the care of Stockman with Bebop and Rocksteady as his bodyguards. When Tiger Claw returns to report the loss of an entire weapons cache thanks to the Turtles and Karai back in Manhattan, making it clear Karai wants to take Shredder down one piece at a time by destroying his criminal empire before taking him out, Shredder decrees that if it's a war Karai wants, it's a war she'll get, before Stockman hooks an I.V. filled with mutagen up to Shredder, and as the mutagen is injected into Shredder, his eyes open wide as the mutagen takes effect. In \"The Insecta Trifecta\", Shredder is still receiving the mutagen drip as he now turns to Stockman as his last hope due to his undying loyalty since Tiger Claw and the others have become useless as of late in stopping Karai and the Turtles. When Stockman returns to report his mission a failure, Shredder is not worried about it, revealing to Stockman that his mutagen drip is finally taking effect as Shredder deploys a pair of blades from the back of his hand, right out of the skin itself. In \"The Super Shredder\", Shredder forces Stockman to give him the rest of the mutagen drip, which mutated him into his Super Shredder form, although it ended up monstrous he was still pleased. This form left him with blades coming out of his body, a muscular build, and bandaged feet and ankles. Shredder then collects his henchmen and travels back to his old lair. Karai tries to fight the Shredder along with Shinigami, but Shredder easily knocks Shinigami unconscious and he escapes with Karai. He then notices a van coming straight towards him (The Shell Raiser), and flips it over. He tells the turtles to have splinter meet him at the place that he last beat him. Shredder then sets the vehicle on fire and the turtles flee to the sewers. Shredder then creates a trap for Splinter and the Turtles, which is full of photos of Splinter, Tang Shen, and Karai. When Splinter enters he drops bars of iron to avoid them from escaping. He then light fire towards them but they jump underwater. As the Turtles, Splinter, and April continue to approach Shredder, Karai makes a remark and Splinter follows, but later finds out he was led into another trap. Shredder forces Splinter to fight him but Splinter escapes, ready to set up a plan of his own. Splinter leads Shredder to the Undercity, where he puts his plan into action. Shredder eventually finds Splinter and he steps on his tail. Shredder then takes Splinter deeper into the UnderCity, where he decides to finish him. Just as Shredder was about to strike Splinter, his arm started to lose control, causing him to step back. Splinter then throws a blade at a few gas tanks and both Splinter and Shredder fall to their deaths. However, in the following episode, \"Darkest Plight\", Shredder and Splinter are separated during the fall, and Shredder returns to the top of the Under-city to be rescued by Tiger Claw, who takes him back to recover before hunting down the Turtles. While Tiger Claw deals with April and Karai, Shredder goes after Leonardo, and nearly crushes him to death before Karai and April arrive to help. During the battle, Shredder tosses a wrecked fuel tanker semi-truck at Karai, only for April to catch it in her psychic grip, causing her Sol Star crystal to cause her eyes to glow blue and smile malevolently before hurling it back at Shredder. However, before Shredder can kill Leo, Karai pleads with him to reconsider doing something good in his life instead of being consumed by his vengeance. This lures Shredder in close enough for Karai to hit him in his most vulnerable spot: His exposed, pulsating mutated heart. Weakened, Shredder is saved by Tiger Claw, who drives him back to their hideout, where Shredder demands a larger dose of the mutagen from Stockman. When Tiger Claw objects, knowing it is too dangerous, Shredder overpowers him, forces Stockman to administer the dosage and roars as the mutagen takes effect as Tiger Claw watches in horror and fear. In \"Tale of Tiger Claw\", he is shown as a M.O.U.S.E.R. hologram to warn Tiger Claw of his next move against Splinter.\n\nIn \"Requiem\", he returns to New York City, far stronger and more vengeful than ever before. He shows up at the hideout where Karai is planning her next move with Shnigami and the Mighty Mutanimals. He defeats the Mutanimals effortlessly and badly injures Karai in the process. On the WOLF building, he faces off against Splinter, Slash, Raphael, April and Casey. He ultimately manages to murder Splinter and hurls him from the building to his death. He is then blasted by a tremendously powerful psychic wave from an enraged April, and is crushed by a garbage truck, though he again survives the onslaught.\n\nIn the [[Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles (2012 TV series, season 4)|season four]] finale \"Owari\" he has his lackeys prepare for the inevitable arrival of the Turtles, April and Casey. He burns down his new lair and confronts the Turtles in a final showdown on the roof. His unique mutation makes him immune to Donatello's retro-mutagen, which allows him to beat Raphael, Donatello and Michelangelo all at once, leaving only Leonardo left standing. After a heated one-on-one duel, Shredder is finally killed by Leonardo.\n\nMany months later, the Kabuto and his own heart were separated by unknown means and hidden in secret locations throughout New York. His heart was contained within a glass vial that came into the possession of Don Vzioso, which Tiger Claw and Kavaxas seek, as it is essential to revive him and then came back in a zombie-like form that wanted to die. Zombie Shredder was able to drag Kavaxas back to the Netherworld as they \"belong dead.\"\n\n===2018 animated series===\nIn the [[Rise of the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles|2018 animated series]], Shredder appears as the demonic leader of the Foot Clan. His backstory is that he was a man who was consumed by the Kuroi Yoroi armor. Shredder terrorized Japan until he was defeated by Splinter's ancestors 500 years ago and the Kuroi Yoroi was scattered across the world to prevent his return.\n\nThe Foot Clan, allied with Baron Draxum, are collecting the armor pieces to resurrect him starting in \"Shadow of Evil.\"\n\nIn \"Warren and Hypno, Sitting in a Tree\", Baron Draxum claims the gauntlet that turned out to be part of the Kuroi Yoroi.\n\nIn \"Operation: Normal\", the Foot Lieutenant and the Foot Brute target the slime Y\u014dkai Sunita because the boots she was wearing are part of the Kuroi Yoroi. They managed to claim them.\n\nIn \"How to Make Enemies and Bend People to Your Will\", Baron Draxum and the Foot Recruit find Kuroi Yoroi fragment is at the botanical gardens. They claim it after setting up events where the Foot Lieutenant and the Foot Brute would fail.\n\nIn \"One Man's Junk\", the next piece of the Kuroi Yuroi was in the possession of Repo Mantis who claimed from a Y\u014dkai and held in his salvage yard. After trapping the cat/mantis mutant Mrs. Nubbins who was owned by Repo Mantis, the Turtles learn from him that two fire-headed guys working as shoe salesmen bought them metal from him. This causes the Turtles to learn that the Foot Lieutenant and the Foot Brute claimed the metal.\n\nAfter the Kuroi Y\u014droi was completed in \"End Game\", Baron Draxum dons the armor and the Foot Brute and Lieutenant address him as Shredder, but he rejects the title. Furthermore, due to a flaw in the armor (the Turtles' Jupiter Jim figure shoved in to cover a hole when the faceplate was used as a tea kettle), the transformation failed to complete. After Draxum was defeated and cast out of the armor, it reassembled itself, having drained Draxum of his life force.\n\nIn \"Many Happy Returns\", Shredder acted like a feral beast. The Foot Lieutenant, Foot Brute, and Foot Recruit retreat to find out what went wrong. After discovering a flux in Shredder, Big Mama was able to provide a baubel for the Turtles and Splinter to trap Shredder with her doing a secret last-minute alteration to this plan.\n\n==Films==\nThe Shredder was played by [[James Saito]] in the first movie and by [[Fran\u00e7ois Chau]] in the second, while his immense Super Shredder form was played by professional wrestler [[Kevin Nash]].<ref>[https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0621760/ Kevin Nash (I)<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> In all cases, the character was voiced by David McCharen. The Shredder's costume was, in the first movie, originally the same as in the original comic, with a red color. However, this was changed in the sequel to a violet color, reflecting the more cartoonish nature of the second film. In both movies, he also had a silver and black cape. In both films, he is served by his second-in-command Tatsu. In the Japanese versions, the Shredder is voiced by [[Norio Wakamoto]] (1st movie in VHS version), [[Hidekatsu Shibata]] (first movie in TV version), and [[Takeshi Watabe]] (second movie).\n\n===''Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles'' (1990)===\n[[File:Shredder (James Saito).jpg|thumb|upright|[[James Saito]] as The Shredder in the film ''[[Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles (1990 film)|Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles]]'' (1990)]]\n\nIn the first movie ''[[Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles (1990 film)|Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles]]'', Oroku Saki and Hamato Yoshi were rival martial artists in Japan and both loved a woman named Tang Shen. Shen, who loved only Yoshi, persuaded him not to fight Saki honorably; instead, they fled for the United States. Saki followed them to New York City; when Yoshi returned home from his construction job he found his beloved Shen lying on the floor. And then, he saw her killer. Saki wasted no words and during the struggle, Splinter's cage was broken. Splinter leaped up into Saki's face, biting and clawing. But Saki threw him to the floor and took one swipe with his [[katana]], slicing Splinter's ear. After this incident, it was said that Saki is never heard from again. The comic book adaptation of the film retains the original comic book origin story, with Oroku Nagi being slain and Saki coming to America to seek vengeance.\n\nSaki, in the \"Shredder\" persona, establishes an American branch of the Foot Clan. With the aid of his second-in-command Tatsu, he manipulates and recruits troubled teens as a brutal yet Machiavellian leader and father figure, teaching them ninjitsu to make them into skilled thieves and [[Assassination|assassins]]. Shredder sends the Foot Clan to \"silence\" [[April O'Neil]] when she reports on the Foot Clan's connection to the recent crime wave, inadvertently leading them to the Turtles' hideout when Raphael saves April. Shredder had Splinter kidnapped and imprisoned him in his warehouse hideout, and has the Foot Clan hunt the Turtles. He beats Splinter while interrogating him about how the Turtles learned their fighting techniques.\n\nAfter the Turtles successfully defeat the Foot Clan in a final assault, Shredder confronts them on a rooftop. He defeats all of the Turtles with his superior skills and threatens Leonardo with his [[yari]] to force the others to toss away their weapons. Splinter, freed by Turtles' allies, Danny Pennington and [[Casey Jones (TMNT)|Casey Jones]], intervenes and reveals to Shredder that they met years ago, as he was Hamato Yoshi's pet. Shredder unmasks himself, revealing the scars that Splinter gave him, and charges towards Splinter to impale him. Splinter counters with Michelangelo's [[nunchaku]] to send him over the side of the roof. Shredder throws a tanto at Splinter. Splinter caught the knife, but had to let go of the nunchaku that was holding onto the spear, making Shredder fall into a parked [[garbage truck]] far below. Casey Jones then activates the crushing mechanism; the viewers are then shown a closeup of the Shredder's helmet being crushed, implying his death.\n\n===''TMNT II: The Secret of the Ooze'' (1991)===\nIn the second movie ''[[Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles II: The Secret of the Ooze]]'', the Turtles believe that since Casey had crushed him in the garbage truck, the Shredder was dead. It is soon revealed that Shredder had survived the crushing and revitalized his Foot Clan to get vengeance on the Turtles. After finding the Foot \"fallback\" headquarters in a junkyard, Tatsu was asking who would challenge him to cover for Shredder until Shredder appeared. Tatsu allowed Shredder to lead the Foot Clan. Shredder sent a member of the Foot to follow April, hoping to find the Turtles through her. When April's team was doing a report on T.G.R.I. in [[New Jersey]], April's camera operator/Foot Clan member Freddy found some mutated [[dandelion]]s and sent one to the Shredder. He then orders Tatsu to obtain a sample of the T.G.R.I. mutagen that mutated the Turtles, as well as kidnap researcher Jordan Perry. Using the last mutagen and Perry's research, the Shredder creates his own mutants, [[Tokka and Rahzar]], from a stolen [[Alligator snapping turtle|snapping turtle]] and a brown [[wolf]] respectively. Though initially enraged at their infant-like intelligence, he soon plays it to his advantage by manipulating the mutants as they imprinted him as their surrogate parent.\n\nAfter a failed attempt to kill the Turtles in the junkyard using a captured Raphael, Shredder unleashed Tokka and Rahzar onto a city street to \"have fun\" and destroy it. The Foot spy then gave April a message for the Turtles: that the Shredder would turn the mutants loose on [[Central Park]] next if they did not accede to a rematch at the construction site. After the Turtles de-mutate the two mutants (with help from Perry) and defeat Tatsu in a nightclub, the Shredder appears and threatens to mutate an innocent woman with a small reserve mutagen vial (the canister was knocked away by the Turtles' new human ally, Keno). Before he can mutate her, he is stopped when the Turtles play a keytar at full volume, sending the Shredder flying through a window from the force of a blown speaker. When the Turtles follow him outside on a pier, they discover that the Shredder has used the mutagen vial on himself. He is transformed into a massive \"Super Shredder\", an almost mindless giant-mutant being with immense [[superhuman strength]]. During his fight with the Turtles, Super Shredder knocks down the pier's pilings in a mindless rage, which then collapses onto him with the Turtles falling into the water below. Though the Turtles survive, the Shredder meets his demise from getting crushed by the destroyed pieces of the pier.\n\n===''Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles III'' (1993) and ''TMNT'' (2007)===\nThe Shredder did not appear in the [[Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles III|third film]] but is shown briefly at the beginning of the [[TMNT (film)|fourth film]] to help give the backstory of the Turtles, and his helmet that he wore in the 1990 film is visible on Splinter's shelf of mementos at the end of the movie. The possibility of his return is also strongly hinted at in the end of the film by Karai. However, the established storyline was abandoned in favor of the 2014 reboot.\n\n===''Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles'' (2014)===\n[[Japanese Americans|Japanese American]] actor Tohoru Masamune portrayed the Shredder in ''[[Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles (2014 film)|Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles]]''.<ref>{{cite web|title=Film Review: 'Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles'|website=variety.com|url=https://variety.com/2014/film/reviews/film-review-teenage-mutant-ninja-turtles-1201274733/|quote= Several years later, a crime wave is in full force in the city, led by a walking Cutco display called the Shredder (Tohoru Masamune) and his massive Foot Clan, though they've started to get their asses whupped by a stealthy troupe of martial-arts-savvy vigilantes.|accessdate=August 4, 2014}}</ref> Initially, [[William Fichtner]] was intended to portray a Caucasian version of the Shredder, with the anglicized real name of [[Eric Sacks]], instead of Oroku Saki.<ref>{{cite web|title='Crossing Lines': William Fichtner Reveals 'Sons Of Anarchy' Star Joining Show|url=http://huffpost.com/ca/entry/3478979|quote=What are you doing in \"Ninja Turtles\"?

In contrast to much of the brand's history, Sacks, not Shredder, is the character connected to the Turtles' origins, having created them alongside April O'Neil's father; the Shredder (never referred to with any name other than his codename) has no connection to Splinter or the Turtles, and while he is shown to have scars on his face, it is not revealed how he suffered them.\n\nIn the earliest stages of development for the film, Shredder was reimagined as \"Colonel Schrader\", the military leader of the [[black-ops]] unit \"The Foot\", revealed later in the script to be a yellow-skinned, red-eyed alien with the ability to sprout spikes.<ref>{{cite web|author=Jamie Frevele at 11:18 am Wed, Aug 29, 2012 |url=http://boingboing.net/2012/08/29/leaked-ninja-turtles-script.html |title=The internet uncovers the horrible Ninja Turtles bullet we all dodged |publisher=Boing Boing |date=2012-08-29 |accessdate=2014-05-08}}</ref> This idea was dropped after [[Evan Daugherty]] was hired to rewrite the script in early 2013.<ref>[http://deadline.com/2013/02/teenage-mutant-ninja-turtles-release-pushed-to-june-6-2014/ 'Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles' Release Pushed To June 6, 2014] Retrieved July 2, 2013</ref>\n\nIn the film, Shredder is the leader of the Foot Clan, who is terrorizing [[New York City]]. After a [[Raphael (Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles)|vigilante]] stops the Foot Clan, Shredder orders the Foot to take hostages down the subway in order to lure the vigilante out. Later in the film, Shredder's adopted son, Eric Sacks, informs Shredder that the vigilante is in fact four mutated Turtles who are test subjects of Project Renaissance, a science experiment of April O'Neil's late father. Sacks gives Shredder an armed suit and a helmet, the latter and the Foot Clan attack the Turtles' lair, where he defeats [[Splinter (Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles)|Splinter]] and kidnaps three Turtles after Raphael was presumed dead. Sacks drains the Turtles' blood in order to create mutagen so that he can complete his and Shredder's plan: the latter will release a virus across the city and Sacks will sell the mutagen as a cure for the disease, making him even richer. As Shredder prepares to release the virus, the Turtles escape and confront him. Although he nearly defeats them, the Turtles were able to conquer Shredder with the help of April, which causes him to fall from the building on which he stood, but he survives and is shown to have a sample of the mutagen.\n\n===''Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Out of the Shadows'' (2016)===\n[[Brian Tee]] portrayed Shredder in the 2016 film, ''[[Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Out of the Shadows]]''. In the beginning of the movie, the Foot Clan, led by a scientist named [[Baxter Stockman]], attempt to help Shredder escape from prison. Although the turtles try to prevent the escape, Stockman was able to help Shredder escape using a teleportation device. But Shredder is hijacked mid-teleport and ends up in a place called [[Dimension X (Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles)|Dimension X]]. There, he meets [[Krang]], who gives Shredder a mutagen canister in exchange for a promise to find the three components of a machine that Krang sent to [[Earth]] long ago, which when united will open a portal to his dimension. Shredder returns to New York City and recruits two criminals named Bebop and Rocksteady and has Stockman use Krang's mutagen to transform them to powerful animal mutants- a warthog and rhinoceros. Shredder, Bebop and Rocksteady find the components in a museum in New York and in a jungle in [[Brazil]]. Shredder and Stockman unite the components, creating a portal to Krang's dimension. Shredder betrays Stockman and has his men take him away, but upon entering the [[Technodrome]], Krang immediately betrays Shredder, freezing him and locking him away with his collection of other defeated foes.\n\n===''Batman vs. Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles''===\nAndrew Kishino voices Shredder in the [[crossover (fiction)|crossover]] animated film, ''[[Batman vs. Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles]]''. In the film, Shredder allies his forces with [[Ra's al Ghul]] and the [[League of Assassins]] to build a machine designed to transform [[Gotham City|Gotham]]'s citizens into unhinged mutants. In exchange for his assistance, Ra's promises Shredder access to one of his Lazarus Pits, which would grant him eternal life. When he and the Foot Clan try to steal a cloud seeder from [[Wayne Enterprises]], he ends up fighting Batman and barely comes out victorious after using an ancient technique. \n\nLater, he fights [[Batman]] once more when the Turtles and the Bat Family arrive at Ace Chemicals to stop him and Ra's from activating the machine. Though he gains the upper hand on the Dark Knight once again, he is thrown off when Batman says \"Cowabunga\" and gains assistance from Raphael. After Michaelangelo and Donatello destroy the machine, the debris sends him into a vat of chemicals as the plant explodes. In the post-credits scene, he is revealed to have survived the explosion and now strongly resembles [[the Joker]].\n\n==Video games==\nAs the original [[List of Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles video games|''TMNT'' video games]] are mostly based on the 1987 cartoon, Shredder is often based on his first cartoon incarnation. He usually executes some plan to provoke the Turtles into retaliating and defeat them; these include kidnapping April O'Neil and stealing the [[Statue of Liberty]]. Shredder is usually the last boss in the games.\n*''[[Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles (NES game)|''Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles]]'' ([[NES]], 1989): Shredder is the final boss. He is found at the end of the Technodrome level. He causes the Turtles to lose roughly half their energy if he touches them, and has a gun that can de-mutate them, which instantly kills them. He wears a red costume like in the Mirage comics.\n*''[[Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles (arcade game)|Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles]]'' ([[Arcade game|arcade]], 1989): Once again, Shredder is the final boss and is found at the end of the Technodrome level. He is armed with a sword, and has the ability to clone himself (the exact number of clones is one more than the number of Turtles attacking him in the arcade version). Shredder and his clones also have the ability to shoot lightning bolts from a device on the helmet, which de-mutate the Turtles they hit, killing them. When Shredder or one of his clones is close to death, his helmet falls off, a unique occurrence in the game series.\n*''[[Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Fall of the Foot Clan]]'' (1990): This game was the first one not to feature Shredder as the final boss. Instead, Shredder is the boss of the penultimate stage, which is set in a river. It is also the first game in which Shredder does not have the ability to de-mutate the Turtles. His only attack is a sword swipe, but he can teleport if hit. The final boss is Krang.\n*''[[Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: The Manhattan Missions]]'' (1991): In this [[PC game]], Shredder fights the turtles in his Manhattan hideout, decorated in a Japanese style. His appearance is based on the Mirage comic version.\n*''[[Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles III: The Manhattan Project]]'' (1992): This game is the first to feature both a battle against Shredder and a second one against a mutated Super Shredder. The first battle takes place at the end of the Technodrome level, which is the sixth of the eight levels of the game. In this battle, Shredder uses a sword to attack the Turtles. Shredder later returns as the final boss of the game, on the stage set in Krang's spacecraft. This time, he mutates himself into Super Shredder, much as he did in the second movie which had been released earlier the same year (1991). Super Shredder has two superpowers, the ability to call down lightning, and the ability to shoot fireballs. These fireballs can de-mutate the Turtles, but unlike other games, this is not an instant kill.\n*''[[Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles II: Back from the Sewers]]'' (1991): A sequel to ''Fall of the Foot Clan'', this game also features Shredder as a regular level boss and Krang as the final boss. He does not have the ability to de-mutate the Turtles, but he does have a wider variety of attacks than in the previous [[Game Boy]] game. Shredder returns later in his mutated Super Shredder form, as a sub-level boss of the final Technodrome level. However, in this incarnation, his only super-power is the ability to teleport elsewhere on the screen. He attacks the Turtles using a sword.\n*''[[Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Turtles in Time]]'' (1991): Shredder is again the final boss of the game, and found in the Technodrome. However, this time, he is not preceded by a Technodrome level. Instead, the Turtles fight through a Starbase level in the future (2100 AD) with Krang as boss, then teleport to the Technodrome in the present (1991 in the arcade game and 1992 in the [[SNES]] version) for the final confrontation. Shredder attacks with a sword, and can fire energy attacks. In the SNES port of the game, Shredder begins the battle by mutating himself into Super Shredder, and has the added superpowers of super-speed movement, fire ground attacks, ice air attacks, and a de-mutating fire ball which costs a turtle a life. The SNES port also added a Technodrome level earlier in the game, which leads to a battle with a regular Shredder. In this battle, Shredder is in a kind of battletank, armed with a machine gun and claws. The player views the action over Shredder's shoulder inside the tank, and the only way to cause damage is to hurl the never-ending waves of Foot Soldiers toward the screen and into the tank.\n*''[[Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: The Hyperstone Heist]]'' (1992): This game uses a Super Shredder similar to the one in ''Turtles in Time''. His attacks are roughly the same.\n*''[[Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles III: Radical Rescue]]'' (1993): Unlike its two predecessors, ''Fall of the Foot Clan'' and ''Back from the Sewers'', this game does feature Shredder as the final boss. However, this time Shredder has become Cyber Shredder, half-man and half-machine. This form of Shredder possessed deadly kick moves and energy ball attacks, as well as being the only boss in the game with two life meters, as the meter instantly refills after it is drained the first time.\n\n[[File:Shredder villain SNES.gif|thumb|Shredder in the SNES version of ''Tournament Fighters'']]\n*''[[Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Tournament Fighters]]'' (1993): This is the first game in which Shredder is not a boss but instead a regular playable character. Furthermore, his costume is based on the Mirage comics version. Finally, in the SNES incarnation of this game, he appears under the name Cyber-Shredder, but there is no indication that he has become a cybernetic being as in ''Radical Rescue''.\n\nAfter a 10-year hiatus, a new series of ''TMNT'' games was initiated. These new games are based on the 2003 cartoon series, and likewise, Shredder in the games is the same as in the cartoon.\n*''[[Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles (2003 video game)|Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles]]'' (2003): Shredder appears as the final boss. The Turtles face him on the helicarrier at the top of the Foot Helicarriers; he wields the Sword of Tengu in this fight. Shredder's combo attacks are quick and nearly continuous. When half of his health bar has been depleted, his attacks become much faster. There is also a secret final boss in which the player faces Shredder as Oroku Saki. His combos are much quicker and deadlier, and he also has a temporary powered-up state.\n*''[[Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles 2: Battle Nexus]]'' (2004): The game begins a short while before the end of the previous game, and Shredder is encountered by the Turtles in the second stage of the game; however, he is not fought by the player, only in a cutscene. As in the cartoon, Shredder is defeated, but he survives the assault on his headquarters. Shredder resurfaces in the TCRI building later on, but once again, the player does not directly fight him; the main goal of the mission being to evacuate the Utroms back to their home planet. He is seemingly killed in the destruction of the TCRI building, but he once again survives. In a sub-plot exclusive to the game, he is detailed as being a mass murderer of Utroms on their homeworld, and he gave Utrom mercenary Slashurr a permanent scar. He later wiped Slashurr's memory, and employed him to kill the Turtles. However, Slashurr eventually remembers his past, and with the Turtles, battles Shredder and the Foot on his ship. The Turtles eventually defeat Shredder once again. In the Battle Nexus fighting tournament mode, Shredder appears as the final boss of the Foot Fight tournament, though the nature of these tournaments when it comes to the game's canon is questionable.\n*''[[Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Melee]]'' (2005): Shredder appeared as a playable character and opponent in three forms\u2014his standard armor, without the armor (as Oroku Saki), and a golden \"Mega\" Shredder.\n*''[[Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles 3: Mutant Nightmare]]'' (2005) The third chapter of the game, \"Exodus\", deals directly with the Turtles thwarting the Foot's efforts. As in the third-season finale, the Turtles and Splinter battle the Foot at their headquarters, and follow the Shredder aboard his starship. They nearly sacrifice themselves to kill Shredder as well, but the Utroms rescue them, and exile Shredder to a distant ice asteroid forever. Shredder is also encountered in the dark future as one of the final bosses of the Nightmare chapter of the game.\n*''[[TMNT (video game)|TMNT]]'' (2007): In the console versions of the 2007 movie-based game, Shredder appears as a boss in a flashback-within-a-flashback (as the events of the game are told to Splinter after their occurrence). The armor of Shredder in this game is based on the 2003 cartoon series version.\n*''[[Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Smash-Up|TMNT: Smash Up]]'' (2009): Shredder is a playable character in the [[PlayStation 2|PS2]] and [[Wii]] fighting game. He appears in both his Utrom Shredder and Cyber Shredder forms.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://wii.ign.com/dor/objects/14305526/teenage-mutant-ninja-turtles-smash-up/images/teenage-mutant-ninja-turtles-smash-up-20090819101955472.html |title=IGN: Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Smash-Up Screenshots (Wii) 2966717 |publisher=Wii.ign.com |date= |accessdate=2014-05-08}}</ref>\n*''[[Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Out of the Shadows (video game)|Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Out of the Shadows]]'' (2013): Shredder appears as both the penultimate and final boss of the game. He recruits Baxter Stockman to build a new helmet for him using stolen Krang technology, which gives him [[Psychokinesis|telekinetic]] powers, including the abilty to fly. Shredder is first fought in his lair when the Turtles come to save April and learn about his scheme. After escaping, he is fought again in the Krangs's secret undergroung facility, this time donning his new helmet built by Stockman. He is ultimately defeated by the Turtles, who destroy his helmet, leaving him to swear revenge.\n*''[[Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles (2014 film)|Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles]]'' (2014): The [[Nintendo 3DS]] game based on the 2014 film, Shredder, who is actually Eric Sacks, appears as the final boss. However, after defeating him, it is revealed that it was all an illusion created by Baxter Stockman, to allow the real Shredder to escape.\n\n==Other appearances==\nIn the anime adaptation ''[[Mutant Turtles: Choujin Densetsu-hen]]'', the backstory from the original cartoon was preserved. Unlike the rest of the main cast, Shredder's appearance was changed to match the ''Supermutants'' Shredder toy that was being sold at that time. The manga explained this by saying his original outfit was destroyed in a battle with the Turtles and Krang created the new armor for him. Shredder also gains the ability to transform into the dragon Devil Shredder using the Mutanite crystals he stole from the Neutrinos. With the energy from the evil [[Sprite (creature)|sprite]] Dark Mu, he was later able to transform into the gigantic Dark Devil Shredder. In the second volume of the anime he gets his Tiger Spirit ''Metal Mutant'' armor. He was voiced by [[Kiyoyuki Yanada]].\n\nShredder also made a guest appearance in an episode of the hit YouTube show ''[[Death Battle]]''. In the episode, his weapons and abilities were analyzed against ''[[X-Men]]'' villain [[Silver Samurai]]. In the end, Shredder proved himself the better fighter and beat his opponent.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==External links==\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20051018042755/http://www.ninjaturtles.com/html/profile7.htm The Shredder profile on the official ''TMNT'' website]\n\n{{Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n[[Category:Animated series villains]]\n[[Category:Comics characters introduced in 1984]]\n[[Category:Fictional businesspeople]]\n[[Category:Fictional characters with superhuman strength]]\n[[Category:Fictional code names]]\n[[Category:Fictional crime bosses]]\n[[Category:Fictional dictators]]\n[[Category:Fictional immigrants to the United States]]\n[[Category:Fictional characters from Tokyo]]\n[[Category:Fictional mass murderers]]\n[[Category:Fictional Ninjutsu practitioners]]\n[[Category:Fictional warlords]]\n[[Category:Superhero film characters]]\n[[Category:Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles characters]]\n[[Category:Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles (1987 TV series) characters]]\n[[Category:Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles (2003 TV series) characters]]\n[[Category:Television supervillains]]\n[[Category:Video game bosses]]\n[[Category:Fictional martial arts trainers]]\n[[Category:Fictional assassinated people]]\n[[Category:Fictional prison escapees]]\n[[Category:Fictional kidnappers]]\n[[Category:Fictional demons and devils]]\n[[Category:Fictional terrorists]]\n[[Category:Fictional Japanese people]]\n[[Category:Psychopathy in fiction]]\n", "name_user": "Iridescent", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eVideo games:Cleanup andtypo fixing,typo(s) fixed: bilty \u2192 bility", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shredder_(Teenage_Mutant_Ninja_Turtles)"}

Miffonis specialized in the construction of [[lighthouse|lighthouses]]. He studied in civil engineering at the [[University of Paris]]. In 1905, after obtaining his diploma, he accepted an offer of employment with the [[Fisheries and Oceans Canada|Department of Fisheries and Oceans]] in Canada for work with the ''Commission des phares'' (Commission of Lighthouses), newly created. Miffonis' work was supervised by the Chief Engineer of the Commission, [[William P. Anderson|William Patrick Anderson]], a fervent promoter of [[reinforced concrete]] in the construction of lighthouses.\n\nThe recruitment of Miffonis, for his competence in the use of concrete, corresponded with an intense period of maritime infrastructure construction in Canada, and in particular, the construction of lighthouses. During the first three years of the Commission, Miffonis developed and patented in 1908 plans for the design of tapered reinforced concrete lighthouses with [[flying buttresses]]. \n\nThe importance of Miffonis' role in the construction of Canadian lighthouses between 1908 and 1913 was underestimated until the rediscovery of his correspondence with Anderson. In 1913, Miffonis published a work presenting calculations showing the use of reinforced concrete and its advantages in the construction of lighthouses.\n\nAt then end of the [[First World War]], there was little construction of new lighthouses and Miffonis ended his career with the Department of Fisheries and Oceans. \n\n== Biography ==\n=== Education and arrival in Canada ===\nHenri de Miffonis was born in France in 1882.<ref name=\"BVp54\">{{cite book|author1=Brigitte Violette|author2=L\u00e9\u00efc Godbout|title=La station d'aide \u00e0 la navigation de Pointe-au-P\u00e8re et son phare de b\u00e9ton arm\u00e9 : centenaire d'une construction audacieuse, 1909-2009|location=Qu\u00e9bec|publisher=Parcs Canada|date=2009|pp=54\u201355|isbn=9781100920429}}</ref> He received his education at the University of Paris during a time when reinforced concrete was revolutionizing the building industry in France and was considered the leading edge in its use as a new material.<ref name=\"BVp54\"/> Miffonis was profoundly influenced by this assessment and the use of reinforced concrete was a key element of his career.<ref name=\"BVp54\"/>\n\nIn 1905, Henri de Miffonis joined the Canadian Department of Fisheries and Oceans as an engineer for the ''Commission des phares'' (Commission of Lighthouses).<ref name=\"BVp52\"/> This commission was created in February 1904 to respond to pressure from shipowners asking the Canadian authorities to aid in navigation along the Canadian coasts.<ref name=\"BVp19\">{{cite book|author1=Brigitte Violette|author2=L\u00e9\u00efc Godbout|title=La station d'aide \u00e0 la navigation de Pointe-au-P\u00e8re et son phare de b\u00e9ton arm\u00e9 : centenaire d'une construction audacieuse, 1909-2009|location=Qu\u00e9bec|publisher=Parcs Canada|date=2009|pp=19\u201320|isbn=9781100920429}}</ref><ref name=\"GCC\">{{cite web |url=http://www.ccg-gcc.gc.ca/fra/GCC/USQUE_Commission_phares |title=Historique de la Garde c\u00f4ti\u00e8re canadienne et des Services de la Marine - La Commission des phares |website=www.gcc-ccg.gc.ca|author=Thomas E.

Miffonis specialized in the construction of [[lighthouse|lighthouses]]. He studied in civil engineering at the [[University of Paris]]. In 1905, after obtaining his diploma, he accepted an offer of employment with the [[Fisheries and Oceans Canada|Department of Fisheries and Oceans]] in Canada for work with the ''Commission des phares'' (Commission of Lighthouses), newly created. Miffonis' work was supervised by the Chief Engineer of the Commission, [[William P. Anderson|William Patrick Anderson]], a fervent promoter of [[reinforced concrete]] in the construction of lighthouses.\n\nThe recruitment of Miffonis, for his competence in the use of concrete, corresponded with an intense period of maritime infrastructure construction in Canada, and in particular, the construction of lighthouses. During the first three years of the Commission, Miffonis developed and patented in 1908 plans for the design of tapered reinforced concrete lighthouses with [[flying buttresses]]. \n\nThe importance of Miffonis' role in the construction of Canadian lighthouses between 1908 and 1913 was underestimated until the rediscovery of his correspondence with Anderson. In 1913, Miffonis published a work presenting calculations showing the use of reinforced concrete and its advantages in the construction of lighthouses.\n\nAt then end of the [[First World War]], there was little construction of new lighthouses and Miffonis ended his career with the Department of Fisheries and Oceans. \n\n== Biography ==\n=== Education and arrival in Canada ===\nHenri de Miffonis was born in France in 1882.<ref name=\"BVp54\">{{cite book|author1=Brigitte Violette|author2=L\u00e9\u00efc Godbout|title=La station d'aide \u00e0 la navigation de Pointe-au-P\u00e8re et son phare de b\u00e9ton arm\u00e9 : centenaire d'une construction audacieuse, 1909-2009|location=Qu\u00e9bec|publisher=Parcs Canada|date=2009|pp=54\u201355|isbn=9781100920429}}</ref> He received his education at the University of Paris during a time when reinforced concrete was revolutionizing the building industry in France and was considered the leading edge in its use as a new material.<ref name=\"BVp54\"/> Miffonis was profoundly influenced by this assessment and the use of reinforced concrete was a key element of his career.<ref name=\"BVp54\"/>\n\nIn 1905, Henri de Miffonis joined the Canadian Department of Fisheries and Oceans as an engineer for the ''Commission des phares'' (Commission of Lighthouses).<ref name=\"BVp52\"/> This commission was created in February 1904 to respond to pressure from shipowners asking the Canadian authorities to aid in navigation along the Canadian coasts.<ref name=\"BVp19\">{{cite book|author1=Brigitte Violette|author2=L\u00e9\u00efc Godbout|title=La station d'aide \u00e0 la navigation de Pointe-au-P\u00e8re et son phare de b\u00e9ton arm\u00e9 : centenaire d'une construction audacieuse, 1909-2009|location=Qu\u00e9bec|publisher=Parcs Canada|date=2009|pp=19\u201320|isbn=9781100920429}}</ref><ref name=\"GCC\">{{cite web |url=http://www.ccg-gcc.gc.ca/fra/GCC/USQUE_Commission_phares |title=Historique de la Garde c\u00f4ti\u00e8re canadienne et des Services de la Marine - La Commission des phares |website=www.gcc-ccg.gc.ca|author=Thomas E.

This was the beginning of the [[Informbiro period]], marked by poor relations with the USSR, that came to an end in 1955.\n\n==Views==\nThe split was said by the Soviets to be caused by Yugoslavia's disloyalty to the USSR, while in Yugoslavia and the West it was presented as [[Josip Broz Tito]]'s national pride and refusal to submit to [[Joseph Stalin]]'s will in making Yugoslavia a Soviet [[satellite state]].  The scholar Perovi\u0107 considered the cause to be Stalin's rejection of Tito's plans to absorb the [[People's Socialist Republic of Albania|People's Republic of Albania]] and the [[Kingdom of Greece]] in cooperation with the [[People's Republic of Bulgaria]], thereby setting up a powerful Eastern European bloc outside Moscow's control which would be known as the [[Balkan Federation]].<ref name=\"auto\">Jeronim Perovic, \"The Tito\u2013Stalin Split: A Reassessment in Light of New Evidence.\" ''Journal of Cold War Studies'' (Spring 2007) 9#2 pp: 32-63</ref>\n\n== Origins ==\n{{Eastern Bloc sidebar}}\nDuring the [[World War II|Second World War]], Yugoslavia was occupied by the [[Axis powers|Axis]]. The occupying powers were opposed by several resistance groups; the Communist resistance, led by Marshal [[Josip Broz Tito]], was the largest and took control of the country by 1945, with minimal Soviet intervention. At this point, Tito was loyal to Moscow.\n\nTito's leading role in liberating Yugoslavia not only greatly strengthened his position in his party and among the Yugoslav people, but also caused him to be more insistent that Yugoslavia would get more room to follow its own interests than other [[Eastern Bloc]] leaders who had more reason (and came under more pressure) to recognize Soviet efforts in helping them liberate their own countries from Axis control. This had already led to some friction between the two countries before World War II was even over. Although Tito was formally an ally of Stalin after World War II, the Soviets had set up a spy ring in the Yugoslav party as early as 1945, resulting in an uneasy alliance.<ref>Richard West, ''Tito'' (1994)</ref>\n\nIn the immediate aftermath of World War II, there occurred several armed incidents between Yugoslavia and the [[Western Bloc]]. Following the war, Yugoslavia successfully captured the territory of [[Istria]], as well as the cities of [[Zadar]] and [[Rijeka]] that had formed part of Italy from the 1920s. This move was of direct benefit to the Slavic populations of the regions (i.e. mainly [[Croats]] and [[Slovenes]]). Yugoslav leadership was looking to incorporate [[Free Territory of Trieste|Trieste]] into the country as well, which was opposed by the Western Allies and by Stalin. This led to several armed incidents, notably Yugoslav fighter planes shooting down American transport aircraft, causing angry criticism from the West and from Stalin. From 1945 to 1948, at least four US aircraft were shot down.<ref>[http://www.vojska.net/eng/armed-forces/yugoslavia/airforce/victories/ Air victories of Yugoslav Air Force<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> Stalin was opposed to these provocations, as he felt that the USSR was unready to face the West in open war so soon after the losses of World War II.\n\nIn addition, Tito was openly supportive of the communist side in the [[Greek Civil War]], while Stalin kept his distance, having agreed with [[Winston Churchill|Churchill]] not to support communism there with the [[Percentages agreement]]. Tito planned to absorb Albania and Greece in cooperation with [[People's Republic of Bulgaria|Bulgaria]], thereby setting up a powerful Eastern Europe bloc outside Moscow's control. Stalin could not tolerate that threat.<ref name=\"auto\"/>\n\n== First Cominform ==\nHowever, the world still saw the two countries as the closest of allies. This was evident at the first meeting of the [[Cominform]] in 1947, where the Yugoslav representatives were the most strident critics of the national Communist parties viewed to be insufficiently devoted to the cause, specifically the Italian and French parties for engaging in coalition politics. They were thereby essentially arguing Soviet positions. The headquarters for Cominform were even set up in [[Belgrade]]. However, all was not well between the two countries, due to a number of disputes.\n\n== Trip to Moscow ==\nThe friction that led to the ultimate split had many causes, many of which can ultimately be linked to Tito's regional focus and his refusal to accept Moscow as the supreme Communist authority. The Yugoslavs were of the opinion that the joint-stock companies favored in the Soviet Union were not effective in Yugoslavia. In addition, Tito's deployment of troops in [[People's Socialist Republic of Albania|Albania]] to prevent the civil conflict in Greece from spreading into neighbouring countries (including Yugoslavia), carried out without consulting the Soviets, had greatly angered Stalin.\n\nStalin was also enraged by Tito's aspirations to merge Yugoslavia with Bulgaria (and therefore create a true \"Land of the South Slavs\"), an idea with which he agreed in theory, but which had also taken place without prior Soviet consultation.<ref>Perovic, \"The Tito\u2013Stalin Split: A Reassessment in Light of New Evidence.\"</ref>   He summoned two of Tito's officials, [[Milovan \u0110ilas]] and [[Edvard Kardelj]], to Moscow to discuss these matters. As a result of these talks, \u0110ilas and Kardelj became convinced that Yugoslav-Soviet relations had already reached an impasse.\n\n== Letter exchange ==\nBetween the trip to Moscow and the second meeting of the Cominform, the [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union|Soviet Communist Party]] and the [[League of Communists of Yugoslavia|Yugoslav Communist Party]] (CPY) exchanged a series of letters detailing their grievances. The first CPSU letter, on March 27, 1948, accused the Yugoslavs of denigrating Soviet socialism via statements such as \"socialism in the Soviet Union has ceased to be revolutionary\".<ref>Stephen Clissold, ed. ''Yugoslavia and the Soviet Union, 1939-1973: A Documentary Survey'' (1975) p 172</ref>  It also claimed that the CPY was not democratic enough, and that it was not acting as a vanguard that would lead the country to socialism.  Stalin retorted, \"we cannot consider this kind of organization of the Communist Party as truly Marxist-Leninist or Bolshevik. 'One does not feel any policy of class struggle in the Yugoslav Party.\"<ref>Edvard Kardelj, ''Reminiscences--the Struggle for Recognition and Independence: The New Yugoslavia, 1944-1957'' (1982) p 217</ref>\n\nThe CPY response on April 13 was a strong denial of the Soviet accusations, both defending the revolutionary nature of the party, and re-asserting its high opinion of the Soviet Union. However, the CPY noted also that \"no matter how much each of us loves the land of socialism, the USSR, he can in no case love his own country less.\"<ref>{{cite book|author=Dennison Rusinow|title=The Yugoslav Experiment 1948-1974|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kChoC2FaS7EC&pg=PA28|year=1978|publisher=U.  of California Press|page=28}}</ref> The Soviet answer on May 4 admonished the CPY for failing to admit and correct its mistakes, and went on to accuse the CPY of being too proud of their successes against the Germans, maintaining that the Red Army had \"saved them from destruction\". The CPY's response on May 17 reacted sharply to Soviet attempts to devalue the success of the Yugoslav resistance movement, and suggested that the matter be settled at the meeting of the Cominform to be held that June.\n\n== Second Cominform ==\nTito did not even attend the second meeting of the Cominform, fearing that Yugoslavia was to be openly attacked. On 28 June, the other member countries expelled Yugoslavia, citing \"nationalist elements\" that had \"managed in the course of the past five or six months to reach a dominant position in the leadership\" of the CPY. The resolution warned Yugoslavia that it was on the path back to bourgeois capitalism due to its nationalist, independence-minded positions.\n\n== Results ==\n{{Main|Informbiro period}}\nThe expulsion effectively banished Yugoslavia from the international association of socialist states. After the expulsion, Tito suppressed those who supported the resolution, calling them \"Cominformists\".<ref>Paul Garde, ''Vie et mort de la Yougoslavie'', Fayard, Paris, 2000, p. 91</ref> Many were sent to a [[gulag]]-like prison camp at [[Goli otok]] (\"Barren Island\").<ref>Serge M\u00e9tais, ''Histoire des Albanais'', Fayard, Paris 2006, p. 322</ref> Between 1948 and 1952, the Soviet Union encouraged its allies to rebuild their military forces\u2014especially [[Hungarian People's Republic|Hungary]], which was to be the leading force in a possible war against Yugoslavia.\n\n[[Titoism]] was denounced by Moscow as a heresy that said Communist countries should take a nationalist road to socialism different from that of the Soviet Union.  Across Eastern Europe, Communist leaders suspected of Tito-like tendencies were purged by pro-Moscow elements.<ref>{{cite book|author=Alec Nove|title=Stalinism and After: The Road to Gorbachev|url=https://www.amazon.com/Stalinism-After-Gorbachev-Alec-Nove/dp/0415094453/|year=2005|publisher=Routledge|page=97}}</ref>\n\nAfter Stalin's death and the repudiation of his policies by [[Nikita Khrushchev]], peace was made with Tito and Yugoslavia re-admitted into the international brotherhood of socialist states. However, relations between the two countries were never completely rebuilt; Yugoslavia would continue to take an independent course in world politics, shunning the influence of both west and east. The [[Yugoslav People's Army|Yugoslav Army]] maintained two official defense plans, one against a [[NATO]] invasion and one against a [[Warsaw Pact]] invasion.\n\nTito used the estrangement from the USSR to obtain US aid, as well as to found the [[Non-Aligned Movement]], in which Yugoslavia was a leading force.<ref>{{cite book|title=Yugoslav-American economic relations since World War II|authors=John R.
