The Omnibus Tax Law of 1969 was passed too late by congress to be useful to Marcos' publicity efforts, and at any rate, did not succeed in raising signfiicant new funds.  So it was foreign loans that funded the 70% increase in infrastructure spending from 1966-1970 (compared to the Macapagal administration's spending from 1961-1965) which included the [[North Luzon Expressway]] and the [[Maharlika Highway]], and the construction of 58, 745 pre-fabricated and 38,705 regular schoolbuildings.  The first Marcos administration's budget deficit was thus 72% higher than the Philippine government's annual deficit from 1961\u20131965.<ref name=\"Kasaysayan9ch10\"/>\n\nThis began a pattern of loan-funded spending which the Marcos administration would continue until the Marcoses were deposed in 1986, resulting in economic instability still being felt today, and of debts that experts say the Philippines will have to keep paying well into 2025. The grandest infrastructure projects of Marcos' first term, especially the [[Cultural Center of the Philippines]] complex, also marked the beginning of what critics would call Ferdinand Marcos and First Lady Imelda Marcos' [[Edifice complex]], with grand public infrastructures projects prioritized for public funding because of their propaganda value.\n\n==Jabidah expose and Muslim reactions ==\n{{main|Jabidah massacre|Moro conflict}}\nIn March 1968 a Muslim man named Jibin Arula was fished out of the waters of Manila Bay, having been shot.

The Omnibus Tax Law of 1969 was passed too late by congress to be useful to Marcos' publicity efforts, and at any rate, did not succeed in raising signfiicant new funds.  So it was foreign loans that funded the 70% increase in infrastructure spending from 1966-1970 (compared to the Macapagal administration's spending from 1961-1965) which included the [[North Luzon Expressway]] and the [[Maharlika Highway]], and the construction of 58, 745 pre-fabricated and 38,705 regular schoolbuildings.  The first Marcos administration's budget deficit was thus 72% higher than the Philippine government's annual deficit from 1961-1965.<ref name=\"Kasaysayan9ch10\"/>\n\nThis began a pattern of loan-funded spending which the Marcos administration would continue until the Marcoses were deposed in 1986, resulting in economic instability still being felt today, and of debts that experts say the Philippines will have to keep paying well into 2025. The grandest infrastructure projects of Marcos' first term, especially the [[Cultural Center of the Philippines]] complex, also marked the beginning of what critics would call Ferdinand Marcos and First Lady Imelda Marcos' [[Edifice complex]], with grand public infrastructures projects prioritized for public funding because of their propaganda value.\n\n==Jabidah expose and Muslim reactions ==\n{{main|Jabidah massacre|Moro conflict}}\nIn March 1968 a muslim man named Jibin Arula was fished out of the waters of Manila Bay, having been shot.

[[weight class]]. He lost the [[National Collegiate Athletic Association]] (NCAA) championship match to [[Chris Pendleton]] in both 2004 and 2005 before winning it in 2006 and 2007. He is known for his pinning ability (he holds the single-season NCAA pin record); his massive afro; and his \"funky\", or unorthodox, wrestling style. For example, while being ridden in the 2005 championship match, he attempted to reach around and apply a [[headlock]] to Pendleton, a move that any wrestling coach would disavow. His tall, lanky body \u2014 in sharp contrast to the squat, muscular physiques of many top wrestlers \u2014 allows him to attempt moves that most wrestlers could not. This characteristic later led to a challenging transition to freestyle wrestling early in his career, as the freestyle rules differ from folkstyle wrestling and penalize a wrestler for exposing his back. His younger brother Max also wrestled for Missouri and won a national championship in 2010.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://mizzouwire.missouri.edu/stories/2010/askren-champion/ |title=Taking it to the Max |publisher=University of Missouri via website |date=April 16, 2010 |access-date=September 9, 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160911220342/http://mizzouwire.missouri.edu/stories/2010/askren-champion/ |archive-date=September 11, 2016 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nAskren had a dominant Junior season in 2005\u201306, winning all 45 of his matches and pinning in 25 of them.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.mutigers.com/news/2006/3/27/Ben_Askren_Named_2006_Recipient_of_Dan_Hodge_Trophy.aspx?path=wrestling  |title=Ben Askren Named 2006 Recipient of Dan Hodge Trophy |publisher=MU Tigers Athletics via website |date=March 27, 2006}}</ref> He won the 174 pound weight class easily at both the [[Big 12]] and NCAA Championships.

Askren competed in the 74&nbsp;kg. weight class at the [[2008 Summer Olympics]]. Askren won his first match via pin against Hungarian [[Istv\u00e1n Ver\u00e9b]].

Though he was a two-time NCAA champion at the University of Missouri he was relatively new to freestyle after wrestling folkstyle in college. \"That wasn't it,\" he said with tears in his eyes, \"I just wasn't good enough.

In 2010, he avenged his Olympic loss by defeating Fundora in the semifinals of the [[Cerro Pelado International]], in Cuba. This came shortly after Askren won the [[Dave Schultz (wrestling)|Dave Schultz]] Memorial International. Later in the same year, Askren defeated 2009 world silver medalist Jake Herbert in a folkstyle rules match at the Midlands Tournament. Askren also competed in the Agon Wrestling Championships and the Flo Premier League.

He also competed in the [[Ultimate Fighting Championship]] (UFC).\n\n== Wrestling ==\nAskren was an assistant [[wrestling]] coach at [[Arizona State University]] and was an American [[collegiate wrestling|amateur wrestler]] for the [[University of Missouri]]. He is a two-time state champion in wrestling at [[Arrowhead High School]] in [[Hartland, Wisconsin]].<ref>http://wrestling.teamusa.org/athletes/ben-askren</ref>\n\n=== Collegiate wrestling ===\n\nIn college, he wrestled in the 174&nbsp;lb. [[weight class]]. He lost the [[National Collegiate Athletic Association]] (NCAA) championship match to [[Chris Pendleton]] in both 2004 and 2005 before winning it in 2006 and 2007. He is known for his pinning ability (he holds the single-season NCAA pin record); his massive afro; and his \"funky\", or unorthodox, wrestling style. For example, while being ridden in the 2005 championship match, he attempted to reach around and apply a [[headlock]] to Pendleton, a move that any wrestling coach would disavow. His tall, lanky body \u2014 in sharp contrast to the squat, muscular physiques of many top wrestlers \u2014 allows him to attempt moves that most wrestlers could not. This characteristic later led to a challenging transition to freestyle wrestling early in his career, as the freestyle rules differ from folkstyle wrestling and penalize a wrestler for exposing his back. His younger brother Max also wrestled for Missouri and won a national championship in 2010.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://mizzouwire.missouri.edu/stories/2010/askren-champion/ |title=Taking it to the Max |publisher=University of Missouri via website |date=April 16, 2010 |access-date=September 9, 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160911220342/http://mizzouwire.missouri.edu/stories/2010/askren-champion/ |archive-date=September 11, 2016 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nAskren had a dominant Junior season in 2005\u201306, winning all 45 of his matches and pinning in 25 of them.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.mutigers.com/news/2006/3/27/Ben_Askren_Named_2006_Recipient_of_Dan_Hodge_Trophy.aspx?path=wrestling  |title=Ben Askren Named 2006 Recipient of Dan Hodge Trophy |publisher=MU Tigers Athletics via website |date=March 27, 2006}}</ref> He won the 174 pound weight class easily at both the [[Big 12]] and NCAA Championships.

Askren finished his collegiate career with an 87 match winning streak. He also became only the second person to win the Dan Hodge Trophy twice, as W.I.N. Magazine named the 2007 winner. Askren was again named the Rev Wrestler of the Year. He also received the [[Schalles Award]], named after [[Wade Schalles]] and given to the most prolific pinner at the end of each season.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.mutigers.com/news/2007/5/14/Missouri_Wrestling_Coach_and_Athlete_Earn_Honors.aspx?path=wrestling\n |title=Missouri Wrestling Coach and Athlete Earn Honors |publisher=MU Tigers Athletics via website |date=May 14, 2007}}</ref>\n\nAskren finished his collegiate wrestling career with a record of 153\u20138, with 91 of those victories coming by way of fall.{{citation needed|date=July 2014}} Those 91 pins put him at third on the all-time NCAA [[Division I (NCAA)|Division I]] pins list. In his four-year career at Missouri, Askren only lost to two opponents, Chris Pendleton of Oklahoma St. and Ryan Lange of Purdue.  He was also a four-time [[All-American]], including being only the twelfth Division I wrestler ever to be a four-time finalist. Askren was also nominated for an [[ESPY]] in 2007 in the category Best Male College Athlete.\nOn January 9, 2012 it was announced that Askren would be one of six new inductees to the [[University of Missouri]] Intercollegiate Athletics Hall of Fame.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.heartlandconnection.com/sports/story.aspx?id=705673 |title=Six chosen for University of Missouri Athletics Hall of Fame |publisher=KTVO-TV via website |date=2012-01-09 |accessdate=2012-01-10 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130918161234/http://www.heartlandconnection.com/sports/story.aspx?id=705673 |archive-date=2013-09-18 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\n=== 2008 Olympics ===\n{{For|more about wrestling at the 2008 Summer Olympics|Wrestling at the 2008 Summer Olympics}}\nIn the summer of 2008, Askren defeated national runner-up Tyrone Lewis in two consecutive matches by decision at the US Olympic Trials in Las Vegas, becoming the second University of Missouri wrestler to qualify for the Olympics. [[Sammie Henson]], who also attended Missouri but finished his college wrestling career at [[Clemson University|Clemson]], competed in the 2000 Olympics winning a silver medal. Askren competed in the 74&nbsp;kg. weight class at the [[2008 Summer Olympics]]. Askren won his first match via pin against Hungarian [[Istv\u00e1n Ver\u00e9b]]. In his round of 8 match he lost to Cuba's [[Ivan Fundora]] 1\u20133, 0\u20134. The Cuban's loss to Russia's [[Buvaisar Saitiev]] in the quarterfinal round ended Askren's hopes of a medal at the [[Wrestling at the 2008 Summer Olympics|2008 Games]].\n\nAskren was asked if inexperience was a factor. Though he was a two-time NCAA champion at the University of Missouri he was relatively new to freestyle after wrestling folkstyle in college. \"That wasn't it,\" he said with tears in his eyes, \"I just wasn't good enough. I sucked.\" <ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.espn.com/olympics/summer08/columns/story?id=3544007 | title=Askren's long wait for shot on Olympic mat ends in tears | publisher=ESPN via website}}</ref>\n\n=== Post-Olympic Career ===\nAlthough Askren decided to pursue a career in MMA after the Olympics, he continued to compete in wrestling occasionally. In 2010, he avenged his Olympic loss by defeating Fundora in the semifinals of the [[Cerro Pelado International]], in Cuba. This came shortly after Askren won the [[Dave Schultz (wrestling)|Dave Schultz]] Memorial International. Later in the same year, Askren defeated 2009 world silver medalist Jake Herbert in a folkstyle rules match at the Midlands Tournament. Askren also competed in the Agon Wrestling Championships and the Flo Premier League. In May 2019, Askren lost by technical superiority to [[Jordan Burroughs]] in the annual Beat the Streets benefit event.<ref>https://www.mmafighting.com/2019/5/7/18535315/ben-askren-got-smoked-at-beat-the-streets-but-wrestling-is-alive-and-well</ref>\n\n== Mixed martial arts career ==\n\nAskren is now an active [[submission wrestling|submission wrestler]], and is a self-proclaimed black belt, which is not recognized in IBJJF in [[Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu|jiu-jitsu]]. In December 2008, he went to [[Coconut Creek, Florida]] to train at the [[American Top Team]] main school where many top fighters train. He currently{{when|date=July 2014}} trains at Roufusport in [[Milwaukee]], where he is the wrestling coach.{{citation needed|date=July 2014}}\n\n=== Early career ===\nAskren made his professional MMA debut on February 7, 2009.<ref name=mmadebut>{{cite web |url=http://mmajunkie.com/news/13837/collegiate-wrestling-stand-out-ben-askren-makes-pro-mma-debut-feb-7.mma |title=Collegiate wrestling stand-out Ben Askren makes pro MMA debut Feb. 7 |publisher=MMAJunkie.com |date=2009-01-27 |accessdate=2010-06-17 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090308091114/http://mmajunkie.com/news/13837/collegiate-wrestling-stand-out-ben-askren-makes-pro-mma-debut-feb-7.mma |archivedate=2009-03-08 }}</ref> It was held by Headhunter Productions at the Holiday Inn Select Executive Center in [[Columbia, Missouri]].

{"title_page": "Driving (horse)", "text_new": "{{Refimprove|date=July 2011}}\n[[Image:Welsh-D-Kutsche.jpg|thumb|A Welsh Cob in harness]]\n\n'''Driving''', when applied to [[horse]]s, [[pony|ponies]], [[mule]]s, or [[donkey]]s, is a broad term for hitching [[equidae|equines]] to a [[wagon]], [[carriage]], [[cart]], [[sleigh]], chariot or other [[horse-drawn vehicle]] by means of a [[horse harness|harness]] or rope and working them in this way. It encompasses a wide range of activities from pleasure driving, to [[harness racing]], to [[farm]] work, [[horse show]]s, and even international [[combined driving]].\n\n==Styles==\nFor [[horse training]] purposes, \"driving\" may also include the practice of ''long-lining'' (''long reining''), wherein a horse is driven without a cart by a handler walking behind or behind and to the side of the animal.  This technique is used in the early stages of training horses for riding as well as for driving.\n\nHorses, [[mule]]s and [[donkey]]s are driven in [[horse harness|harness]] in many different ways.  For working purposes, they can pull a [[plow]] or other [[farm]] equipment designed to be pulled by animals.  In many parts of the world they still pull [[cart]]s, [[wagon]]s, [[horse-drawn boat]]s or [[logging|logs]] for basic hauling and transportation.  They may draw [[carriage]]s at ceremonies, such as when the [[British monarch]] is [[Trooping the Colour]], as well as in parades or for tourist rides.\n\n[[Image:Trabrennbahn-2.jpg|thumb|left|Harness racing]]\n[[File:Harrie Verstappen Warka 2007.jpg|thumb|left|Combined driving]]\nHorses can [[harness racing|race in harness]], pulling a very lightweight one-person cart known as a [[sulky]].  At the other end of the spectrum, some [[draft horse]]s compete in [[horse pulling]] competitions, where single or teams of horses and their drivers vie to determine who can pull the most weight for a short distance.\n\nIn [[horse show]] competition, the following general categories of competition are seen:\n[[Image:Horses and sleigh.jpg|thumb|Horses pulling a sleigh]]\n*[[Combined driving]], an internationally recognized [[International Federation for Equestrian Sports|FEI]] competition where horses compete in one, two, and four-horse teams, pulling appropriately designed light carriages or carts.  They are expected to perform an arena-based \"dressage\" class where precision and control are emphasized, a cross-country \"marathon\" section that emphasizes fitness and endurance, and a \"stadium\" or \"cones\" obstacle course.\n*[[Draft horse showing]]:  Most [[draft horse]] performance competition is done in harness.  Draft horses compete in both single and multiple hitches, judged on manners and performance.\n* [[Carriage]] driving, using somewhat larger two or four wheeled carriages, often restored [[antique]]s, pulled by a single horse, a tandem or [[Four-in-hand (carriage)|four-in-hand]] team. Pleasure competitions are judged on the turnout/neatness or suitability of horse and carriage.\n*[[Pleasure driving]], sometimes called Carriage driving in some nations:  Horses and ponies are usually hitched to a light, two-wheeled cart (four-wheeled fine harness carts are also seen, particularly at the highest levels of competition), and shown at a walk and two speeds of trot, with an emphasis on manners.  Nearly any breed of horse can be trained for pleasure driving.\n*[[Fine harness]]: Also called ''formal driving''.  Horses are hitched to a light four-wheeled cart and shown in a manner that emphasizes flashy action and dramatic performance.  Refined pony breeds and certain light saddle horse breeds noted for their action are most often seen in fine harness.  Most fine harness competition requires horses to perform a bit of a walk, and two types of a high-action \"park\" trot, a slow trot with more controlled but elegant action, and a faster, flashier trot where the horse exhibits the most animation possible, often announced by the command \"show your horses\" (or \"show your ponies\" in the case of pony shows).\n*[[Roadster (horse)|Roadster]]: A horse show competition, usually for ponies, (a few light horse breeds also offer roadster classes), where exhibitors wear [[racing silks]] and ride in a sulky in a style akin to [[harness racing]], only without actually racing, but rather focusing on manners and performance.  Roadsters are shown at two types of trot, known as ''road gait'' and ''at speed''.\n\n==Teams==\n{{See also|Teamster|Combined driving|Draft horse showing}}\n[[Image:Medieval horse team.jpg|thumb|left|Medieval four-horse team: leaders and wheelers]]\nA ''team'' is more than one animal used together for draft.  The animals may be arranged in various ways.   While a single animal is usually placed between two shafts, a ''pair'' (two animals) is usually hitched side by side with a single pole between them.  A ''[[troika (driving)|troika]]'' is a team hitched in a single row of three: the center horse in shafts and each of the other two hitched on either side.  A ''[[tandem]]'' hitch has one rear animal in shafts, then one or more others hitched ahead of the first in single file.\n\nLarger teams are usually in pairs, with four, six or even more animals overall; driving these is known as driving ''[[four-in-hand (carriage)|four-in-hand]]'', ''six-in-hand'' etc.  Sometimes other arrangements are used, such as the \"unicorn\" (one animal in front of a pair), and the \"pickaxe\" (three animals in front of a pair).  Teams larger than six are generally limited to situations where large loads must be hauled over difficult ground.  For example, eight-[[ox]] plowing teams were once common on the heavy soils of southern [[England]], as were very large ox teams used in 19th century [[South Africa]] (see [[ox-wagon]]).  [[Twenty-mule team]]s were used in the mid-19th century for hauling ore in [[California]], and large teams of horses were often needed to pull the heaviest types of [[horse artillery]].\n\n[[Image:Orlowski podrozny.jpg|thumb|A Troika]]\nThe animals in a large team have different tasks.  The ''wheelers'' are the pair (or in tandem, the single animal) closest to the vehicle.  They provide the main braking effort, slowing the vehicle and controlling it downhill by pulling back on the pole or shafts.  The strength of the wheelers is often the limiting factor in determining the maximum safe load for a vehicle &ndash; while all the animals can pull uphill, only the wheelers can hold the vehicle downhill.  For this reason, the strongest pair in a team may be chosen as the wheelers.  Wheelers also steer the vehicle by turning the pole or shafts.\n\nThe ''leaders'' are all the animals in front of the wheelers.  As they are also in front of the pole or shafts they cannot provide any braking effort.\n\nWheelers and leaders in a team usually have somewhat different harness: wheelers usually have [[breeching (tack)|breeching]] so they can pull back on the shafts or pole; leaders do not need breeching, and nor do animals pulling a dragged load such as a [[plow]] (where all the animals are effectively leaders).  Wheelers may not need breeching in very light vehicles, or those with efficient brakes.\n\nHistorically, very heavy loads were sometimes controlled downhill by additional pairs hitched behind the vehicle.  Such additional pairs were often hired to passing vehicles to help them either up or down a particularly steep hill.\n\nA particular pair of horses are often worked together all the time.  They also may often be hitched the same way as well &ndash; each animal always placed on the right-hand or left-hand side.  Traditionally, pairs are often given paired names, as in the well-known example of the names of [[Santa Claus's reindeer]]: Dasher and Dancer, Prancer and Vixen, Comet and Cupid, Donner and Blitzen.\n\n==History==\n[[Image:Hyksos.jpg|thumb|The [[Hyksos]] were an ancient people who drove horses in chariots]]\n{{See also|Domestication of the horse|Chariot|Horse collar}}\nWhile there is some [[anthropological]] evidence that horses were ridden before they were driven, the most unequivocal evidence of domestication and use of the horse as a driving animal are the [[Sintashta]] [[chariot burial]]s in the southern Urals, circa 2000 BC. However, shortly thereafter, the expansion of the domestic horse throughout Europe was little short of explosive.  In the space of possibly 500 years, there is evidence of horse-drawn [[chariot]]s in Greece, Egypt, and Mesopotamia. By another 500 years, the horse-drawn chariot had spread to China.\n\nHorses may have been driven even earlier.  The [[Standard of Ur]], in ancient [[Sumer]], c. 2500 BC, shows horses or some type of [[onager]] or donkey hitched to wheeled carts with a [[yoke]] around their necks, in a manner similar to that of [[oxen]].<ref name=\"Chamberlin\">Chamberlin, J.

In addition, many [[third world]] nations retain a need for driving horses for basic farm work and transportation.\n\n==See also==\n{{Wikisource1911Enc|Driving}}\n{{commonscat|Horse driving}}\n* [[Driving club]]\n*[[Equestrianism]]\n*[[Horse harness]]\n*[[Horse and buggy]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n{{Equine}}\n\n{{short description|The use of horses to pull vehicles or other equipment}}\n\n[[Category:Equestrianism]]\n[[Category:Horse driving| ]]\n", "text_old": "{{Refimprove|date=July 2011}}\n[[Image:Welsh-D-Kutsche.jpg|thumb|A Welsh Cob in harness]]\n\n'''Driving''', when applied to [[horse]]s, [[pony|ponies]], [[mule]]s, or [[donkey]]s, is a broad term for hitching [[equidae|equines]] to a [[wagon]], [[carriage]], [[cart]], [[sleigh]], or other [[horse-drawn vehicle]] by means of a [[horse harness|harness]] and working them in this way. It encompasses a wide range of activities from pleasure driving, to [[harness racing]], to [[farm]] work, [[horse show]]s, and even international [[combined driving]].\n\n==Styles==\nFor [[horse training]] purposes, \"driving\" may also include the practice of ''long-lining'' (''long reining''), wherein a horse is driven without a cart by a handler walking behind or behind and to the side of the animal.  This technique is used in the early stages of training horses for riding as well as for driving.\n\nHorses, [[mule]]s and [[donkey]]s are driven in [[horse harness|harness]] in many different ways.  For working purposes, they can pull a [[plow]] or other [[farm]] equipment designed to be pulled by animals.  In many parts of the world they still pull [[cart]]s, [[wagon]]s, [[horse-drawn boat]]s or [[logging|logs]] for basic hauling and transportation.  They may draw [[carriage]]s at ceremonies, such as when the [[British monarch]] is [[Trooping the Colour]], as well as in parades or for tourist rides.\n\n[[Image:Trabrennbahn-2.jpg|thumb|left|Harness racing]]\n[[File:Harrie Verstappen Warka 2007.jpg|thumb|left|Combined driving]]\nHorses can [[harness racing|race in harness]], pulling a very lightweight one-person cart known as a [[sulky]].  At the other end of the spectrum, some [[draft horse]]s compete in [[horse pulling]] competitions, where single or teams of horses and their drivers vie to determine who can pull the most weight for a short distance.\n\nIn [[horse show]] competition, the following general categories of competition are seen:\n[[Image:Horses and sleigh.jpg|thumb|Horses pulling a sleigh]]\n*[[Combined driving]], an internationally recognized [[International Federation for Equestrian Sports|FEI]] competition where horses compete in one, two, and four-horse teams, pulling appropriately designed light carriages or carts.  They are expected to perform an arena-based \"dressage\" class where precision and control are emphasized, a cross-country \"marathon\" section that emphasizes fitness and endurance, and a \"stadium\" or \"cones\" obstacle course.\n*[[Draft horse showing]]:  Most [[draft horse]] performance competition is done in harness.  Draft horses compete in both single and multiple hitches, judged on manners and performance.\n* [[Carriage]] driving, using somewhat larger two or four wheeled carriages, often restored [[antique]]s, pulled by a single horse, a tandem or [[Four-in-hand (carriage)|four-in-hand]] team. Pleasure competitions are judged on the turnout/neatness or suitability of horse and carriage.\n*[[Pleasure driving]], sometimes called Carriage driving in some nations:  Horses and ponies are usually hitched to a light, two-wheeled cart (four-wheeled fine harness carts are also seen, particularly at the highest levels of competition), and shown at a walk and two speeds of trot, with an emphasis on manners.  Nearly any breed of horse can be trained for pleasure driving.\n*[[Fine harness]]: Also called ''formal driving''.  Horses are hitched to a light four-wheeled cart and shown in a manner that emphasizes flashy action and dramatic performance.  Refined pony breeds and certain light saddle horse breeds noted for their action are most often seen in fine harness.

{"title_page": "Fidel Vel\u00e1zquez S\u00e1nchez", "text_new": "'''Fidel Vel\u00e1zquez S\u00e1nchez''' (May 12, 1900 &ndash; June 21, 1997) was the preeminent [[Mexico|Mexican]] [[labor union|union]] leader of the 20th century. In 1936 he was one of the original founders, along with [[Vicente Lombardo Toledano]], of the [[Confederation of Mexican Workers]] (CTM), the national labor federation most closely associated with the ruling party, the [[Institutional Revolutionary Party]] (PRI). He replaced Lombardo as the leader of the CTM in 1941, then expelled him from it in 1948. He led the CTM, which grew increasingly corrupt and conservative, until his death in 1997.\n\n==Early years==\nVel\u00e1zquez was born in [[San Pedro Azcapotzaltongo]] (now [[Villa Nicol\u00e1s Romero]]), [[State of M\u00e9xico]]. His father was the mayor of the town. The family moved to [[Puebla, Puebla]], during the [[Mexican Revolution]].\n\nAfter his father's death in 1920 Vel\u00e1zquez moved to the [[Azcapotzalco]] area of [[Mexico City]], where he worked, among other things, delivering milk. In 1923 he organized a union of milk industry workers, which he affiliated with the [[Regional Confederation of Mexican Workers|Confederaci\u00f3n Regional Obrera Mexicana]], (CROM), the largest and most powerful union confederation of the day and a key supporter of the regimes of [[Plutarco El\u00edas Calles]] and [[\u00c1lvaro Obreg\u00f3n]].\n\nIn 1928 former President Obreg\u00f3n was assassinated by a right-wing [[Roman Catholic]] associated with the [[Cristero War|Cristero movement]]. While neither CROM nor its leader, [[Luis Napole\u00f3n Morones|Luis Morones]], had any connection to the crime, Calles (who was about to finish his term of office and to begin his run as [[\u00e9minence grise]] behind the presidency in the period known as El Maximato) considered Morones the intellectual author of the assassination because he had denounced Obreg\u00f3n's plans to amend the constitution to allow himself to serve another term as President of Mexico. Obreg\u00f3n's successor, [[Emilio Portes Gil]] &ndash;  a forced ally of Calles due to the upheaval created by Obreg\u00f3n's assassination  &ndash; fired CROM officials from their government posts and threw the government's support to rival union groups, such as the [[General Confederation of Workers (Mexico)|Confederaci\u00f3n General de Trabajadores]], (CGT), a nominally anarchist group, and the Confederaci\u00f3n Sindical Unitaria de M\u00e9xico, a group associated with the [[Partido Comunista de M\u00e9xico|Mexican Communist Party]] (PCM). The CROM began to disintegrate once it lost state support.\n\nVel\u00e1zquez and Jes\u00fas Yuren, head of the Union of Cleaning and Transport Workers, withdrew their unions from the CROM and, on February 25, 1929, organized the Confederaci\u00f3n Sindical de Trabajadores del Distrito Federal (CSTDF), a federation of unions within the Federal District. The CSTDF was a hodgepodge, much like the [[Knights of Labor]] in the [[United States]] in the nineteenth century: it included the two unions led by Vel\u00e1zquez and Yuren, street vendors and merchants organizations, the \"uni\u00f3n blanca\" or [[company union]] of streetcar workers composed largely of strikebreakers, a union of [[homeopathy|homeopathic]] doctors, grave diggers and bottling plant workers.\n\nThree other union leaders, Fernando Amilpa, Alfonso Sanchez Madriaga and Luis Quintero, took their unions out of CROM to affiliate with the CSTDF shortly thereafter. When Morones stated that he was glad to be rid of these \"worms,\" a CGT union leader reportedly said, \"They are not worms, but wolves and will soon eat up the chickens in the hutch.\" The five were thereafter known as ''los cinco lobitos'', or \"the five little wolves\".\n\nVel\u00e1zquez played an active role in trade union affairs in the early 1930s: he was a member of the commission that edited the new Federal Labor Law in 1931, took part in proceedings before the Federal Labor Board, which had the power to register unions or declare a strike legal or illegal, and established ties with both the governmental representatives on the Board and with the employers. As a wave of labor militancy came to M\u00e9xico in the wake of the worldwide depression of the 1930s, Vel\u00e1zquez, leaders of the CGT, and Lombardo Toledano, who had also left CROM, founded the Confederaci\u00f3n General de Obreros y Campesinos de M\u00e9xico (CGOCM) or General Confederation of Workers and Peasants of Mexico, on June 28, 1933.\n\n==Founding the CTM==\n[[File:StatueFidelVelazquezDF.JPG|thumb|right| Statue of Fidel Vel\u00e1zquez which stands in front of the [[Instituto del Fondo Nacional de la Vivienda para los Trabajadores|INFONAVIT]] office in Mexico City]]\nThe CGOCM became the most important union body in Mexico, leading a number of strikes in 1934. When President [[L\u00e1zaro C\u00e1rdenas del R\u00edo]] called on unions for support in resisting a threatened coup by Calles and opposing an employers' strike in [[Monterrey]], the CGOCM and the PCM rallied to his defense.\n\nC\u00e1rdenas also called on these unions to form a single unified body. The CGOCM transformed itself into the Confederaci\u00f3n de Trabajadores de M\u00e9xico, or CTM, in response.\n\nThe CTM almost disintegrated at the moment of its formation. While Lombardo Toledano was a convinced [[Stalinism|Stalinist]] and the most important representative of the [[Soviet Union]] in Mexico and [[Latin America]] for the decade after his visit to the Soviet Union in 1935, he was never a member of the PCM. At the founding convention of the CTM, the PCM and the industrial unions it had organized had been promised the position of organizational secretary, the second most powerful position within the CTM. When Lombardo Toledano gave that position to Vel\u00e1zquez, the left unions walked out of the convention. Under pressure to preserve unity, however, they returned and grudgingly assented to Vel\u00e1zquez's election.\n\nThe PCM and its unions almost walked out of the CTM a second time the following year. [[Earl Browder]], then head of the [[Communist Party USA]], urged them to accept \"unity at all costs\", and they returned. The CTM (along with the CGT, CROM and the electrical workers union) formally aligned with the Partido Revolucionario Mexicano, the precursor of the PRI. as its \"labor sector\" in 1938.\n\nAs part of the party, and therefore effectively part of the state, the CTM received a number of tangible benefits. The Federal Labor Boards, which had the power to determine which unions could represent workers and which strikes were legal, consistently favored the CTM against its rivals. Over time, the CTM became dependent on the PRI and the state for financial support as well: the PRI provided CTM with subsidies, while the CTM in return required all workers to join the union recognized at their workplace and, by extension, the PRI. The PRI also provided CTM leaders with positions at all levels of government and reserved at least one Senatorial position for a CTM leader.\n\nOn the other hand, C\u00e1rdenas took steps to ensure that CTM did not acquire so much power that it could be independent of the party. He prohibited the CTM from representing government employees, creating a separate union federation for these workers, and barred the CTM from admitting farm workers to membership.\n\n==Taking over the CTM==\nAs organizational secretary, Vel\u00e1zquez involved himself in the day-to-day decisions of the organization, building up a power base of patronage. When Lombardo Toledano stepped down as general secretary of the CTM at the end of his term, Vel\u00e1zquez took his place on February 28, 1941. In 1946, the CTM joined in forming the new PRI, becoming one of its constituent parts. As the formal division between the PRI and the state was blurred, the distinctions between the CTM and the party and the state likewise became harder to discern.\n\nLombardo Toledano had remained active in the CTM after Vel\u00e1zquez replaced him. That changed, however, after Lombardo Toledano broke with the PRI in 1947, forming the Partido Popular. The CTM not only refused to endorse the new party, but expelled Lombardo Toledano, his supporters on the CTM's executive board, and other leftwing unionists and withdrew from both the [[Confederaci\u00f3n de Trabajadores de Am\u00e9rica Latina]], a regional confederation founded by Lombardo Toledano, and the pro-Soviet [[World Federation of Trade Unions]]. The CTM subsequently affiliated with the [[International Confederation of Free Trade Unions]].\n\n==Remaking Mexican labor==\nVel\u00e1zquez and the CTM then proceeded, with the help of the state, to eliminate independent union leaders in industrial unions such as the miners', petroleum workers' and railroad workers' unions. The state exercised its authority to oust uncooperative union leaders, either by removing them directly or manipulating internal union elections.\n\nThe new leaders were referred to as ''charros'', or \"cowboys\", after Jes\u00fas D\u00edaz de Leon, the leader imposed on the railroad workers union in 1948, who was known for his fondness for the finery associated with [[Charro|Mexican cowboys]]. The government likewise coerced the STPRM, the union that represented the workers at [[PEMEX]], the state-run petroleum enterprise, to accept Gustavo Rold\u00e1n Vargas as its new leader in 1949 and imposed Jes\u00fas Carrasco on the [[SNTMMSRM|Miners and Metal Workers Union]] (the SNTMMSRM) in 1950.\n\nThese heavy-handed efforts did not always go unopposed: when the government installed Carrasco as the head of the SNTMMSRM, a number of locals bolted from the union to form the National Miners Union. When a strike broke out at the Nueva Rosita mine in 1950, the employer prevailed on local businesses to refuse to sell food to the strikers while the government declared martial law in the area, arresting the leaders of the strike, seizing the union's treasury and barring all meetings. The government used similar tactics in 1959, nationalizing the rail industry, firing thousands of strikers and sentencing union leaders to more than ten years in prison for leading a strike. The CTM approved these and other measures to isolate or eliminate independent unions or insurgent movements. By the end of the 1950s most opposition to Vel\u00e1zquez within the CTM had been eliminated.\n\nThe CTM did not hold a monopoly on labor organizing or even the exclusive relationship with the PRI: the CROM and other organizations also had a formal relationship with the PRI through its Congreso de Trabajo (CT). The CMT had, however, the advantage of state sponsorship, which it used to oppose any independent unions and to hold down the demands of its constituent unions at the behest of PRI leadership. The CTM adopted a practice of entering into \"protection contracts\", which would be called \"[[sweetheart contracts]]\" in the United States, which workers not only had no role in negotiating, but in some cases were not even aware existed. Many of these unrepresentative unions degenerated into organizations that \"sold\" contracts with a CTM affiliate as a guarantee against representation by independent unions, but which did not function as a union in any meaningful sense.\n\n==The age of dinosaurs==\nThose PRI leaders who remained in power acquired the derisive name of \"dinosaurs\". Vel\u00e1zquez was the longest-lived of them all. He became one of the most conservative as well.\n\nVel\u00e1zquez and the CTM were opposed to every movement that opposed the status quo: in 1968 he verbally attacked the student demonstrators who supported [[Cuba]] and called for democracy in M\u00e9xico as radicals inspired by foreign doctrines. The government went further, killing several students in the [[Tlatelolco massacre]] that October. Vel\u00e1zquez supported the suppression of the movement.\n\nIn 1972 the CT expelled STERM, a union of electrical workers that had demanded union democracy and taken a more militant stance toward employers. When the union did not collapse, the government merged it with another union to form a new organization, the SUTERM. Vel\u00e1zquez intervened in SUTERM's internal affairs to drive out the former leaders of STERM, after which employers blacklisted them and their supporters.\n\nEven then, however, those workers persisted, organizing rallies of more than 100,000 electrical workers and their supporters, and calling a strike at the Federal Electrical Commission (CFE) on July 16, 1976. That strike was ended by army units and thugs who occupied the CFE plants; the army interned hundreds of strikers in [[San Luis Potos\u00ed, San Luis Potos\u00ed|San Luis Potos\u00ed]], while thugs beat workers and forced them to sign letters supporting the ''charro'' leadership of the SUTERM.\n\nVel\u00e1zquez was the first to demand that [[Cuauht\u00e9moc C\u00e1rdenas]], who organized the Democratic Current within the PRI in 1987 and went on to found the [[Party of the Democratic Revolution|Partido de la Revoluci\u00f3n Democr\u00e1tica]] (PRD), be expelled from the PRI for arguing for democratization and challenging the entrenched leadership. Vel\u00e1zquez called C\u00e1rdenas a violent radical and suggested that he was a Communist. Vel\u00e1zquez was also one of the first to attack the [[Zapatista Army of National Liberation|Ej\u00e9rcito Zapatista de Liberaci\u00f3n Nacional]] (EZLN) when it led an armed rebellion in [[Chiapas]].\n\nVel\u00e1zquez was also a faithful supporter of the \"technocrats\" within the PRI who sought to dismantle the nationalist economic policies of the Mexican Revolution in order to open Mexico further to foreign investment, including [[Miguel de la Madrid]], [[Carlos Salinas de Gortari]], and [[Ernesto Zedillo Ponce de Le\u00f3n]]. Vel\u00e1zquez continued to support them even as they privatized state-owned industries, a bastion of power for the CTM, as part of the structural adjustment plans imposed by the [[International Monetary Fund]], while signing national pacts that shifted most of the burden to workers while their minimum wage in real terms fell by nearly 70 percent in these years. Vel\u00e1zquez also supported passage of the [[North American Free Trade Agreement]] in 1993 after initially denouncing it as a disaster for workers of all three countries.\n\nEven so, Vel\u00e1zquez's power within the PRI slipped in the 1990s as his own health declined. While in the past every President of Mexico conferred with Vel\u00e1zquez before picking a successor, Vel\u00e1zquez was not consulted in the selection of [[Luis Donaldo Colosio]] as the PRI's candidate for president in 1994 and was given only a few minutes' notice of the selection of Zedillo to replace Colosio after his assassination.\n   \nVel\u00e1zquez called off the traditional [[May Day]] rallies of workers in 1995, threatening those who disobeyed with fines or expulsion, to avoid the possibility of embarrassing displays of opposition to the CTM or the PRI. In lieu of a May Day march in 1996, a group put on a mock funeral for Vel\u00e1zquez.\n\nThe real funeral, attended by all of M\u00e9xico's political elite, came a year later.  Zedillo offered his eulogy for Vel\u00e1zquez: \"Don Fidel knew how to reconcile the special interests of workers with the greater interest of the nation\".\n\nVel\u00e1zquez's interim successor, [[Blas Chumacero]], died three weeks after Vel\u00e1zquez at the age of 92. He was succeeded in turn by [[Leonardo Rodr\u00edguez Alcaine]], aged 76. A rival federation, the National Union of Workers (UNT), was formed in November 1997 to challenge Vel\u00e1zquez's legacy.\n\n==External links==\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20050217055354/http://ueinternational.org/vol2spec.html Obituary for Fidel Vel\u00e1zquez S\u00e1nchez]\n\n==Further reading==\n* [[Dan La Botz|La Botz, Dan]], ''The Crisis in Mexican Labor'', New York : Praeger, 1988. {{ISBN|0-275-92600-1}}\n* [[Dan La Botz|La Botz, Dan]], ''Mask of Democracy, Labor Suppression in Mexico Today'', Boston : South End Press, 1992. {{ISBN|0-89608-437-X}}\n\n{{s-start}}\n{{succession box \n  |title  = Secretary General of the [[Confederation of Mexican Workers]] \n  |years  = 1941\u20131997 \n  |before = [[Vicente Lombardo Toledano]] \n  |after  = [[Blas Chumacero]]}}\n{{succession box \n  | title  = [[Belisario Dom\u00ednguez Medal of Honor]] \n  | years  = 1979\n  | before = [[Gustavo Baz Prada]] \n  | after  = [[Luis Padilla Nervo]]\n}}\n{{s-end}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Velazquez, Fidel}}\n[[Category:Mexican trade unionists]]\n[[Category:Members of the Senate of the Republic (Mexico)]]\n[[Category:Members of the Chamber of Deputies (Mexico)]]\n[[Category:Institutional Revolutionary Party politicians]]\n[[Category:Recipients of the Belisario Dom\u00ednguez Medal of Honor]]\n[[Category:People from Ciudad Nicol\u00e1s Romero]]\n[[Category:1900 births]]\n[[Category:1997 deaths]]\n", "text_old": "'''Fidel Vel\u00e1zquez S\u00e1nchez''' (May 12, 1900 &ndash; June 21, 1997) was the preeminent [[Mexico|Mexican]] [[labor union|union]] leader of the 20th century. In 1936 he was one of the original founders, along with [[Vicente Lombardo Toledano]], of the [[Confederation of Mexican Workers]] (CTM), the national labor federation most closely associated with the ruling party, the [[Institutional Revolutionary Party]] (PRI). He replaced Lombardo as the leader of the CTM in 1941, then expelled him from it in 1948. He led the CTM, which grew increasingly corrupt and conservative, until his death in 1997.\n\n==Early years==\nVel\u00e1zquez was born in [[San Pedro Azcapotzaltongo]] (now [[Villa Nicol\u00e1s Romero]]), [[State of M\u00e9xico]]. His father was the mayor of the town. The family moved to [[Puebla, Puebla]], during the [[Mexican Revolution]].\n\nAfter his father's death in 1920 Vel\u00e1zquez moved to the [[Azcapotzalco]] area of [[Mexico City]], where he worked, among other things, delivering milk. In 1923 he organized a union of milk industry workers, which he affiliated with the [[Regional Confederation of Mexican Workers|Confederaci\u00f3n Regional Obrera Mexicana]], (CROM), the largest and most powerful union confederation of the day and a key supporter of the regimes of [[Plutarco El\u00edas Calles]] and [[\u00c1lvaro Obreg\u00f3n]].\n\nIn 1928 former President Obreg\u00f3n was assassinated by a right-wing [[Roman Catholic]] associated with the [[Cristero War|Cristero movement]]. While neither CROM nor its leader, [[Luis Napole\u00f3n Morones|Luis Morones]], had any connection to the crime, Calles (who was about to finish his term of office and to begin his run as [[\u00e9minence grise]] behind the presidency in the period known as El Maximato) considered Morones the intellectual author of the assassination because he had denounced Obreg\u00f3n's plans to amend the constitution to allow himself to serve another term as President of Mexico. Obreg\u00f3n's successor, [[Emilio Portes Gil]] &ndash;  a forced ally of Calles due to the upheaval created by Obreg\u00f3n's assassination  &ndash; fired CROM officials from their government posts and threw the government's support to rival union groups, such as the [[General Confederation of Workers (Mexico)|Confederaci\u00f3n General de Trabajadores]], (CGT), a nominally anarchist group, and the Confederaci\u00f3n Sindical Unitaria de M\u00e9xico, a group associated with the [[Partido Comunista de M\u00e9xico|Mexican Communist Party]] (PCM). The CROM began to disintegrate once it lost state support.\n\nVel\u00e1zquez and Jes\u00fas Yuren, head of the Union of Cleaning and Transport Workers, withdrew their unions from the CROM and, on February 25, 1929, organized the Confederaci\u00f3n Sindical de Trabajadores del Distrito Federal (CSTDF), a federation of unions within the Federal District. The CSTDF was a hodgepodge, much like the [[Knights of Labor]] in the [[United States]] in the nineteenth century: it included the two unions led by Vel\u00e1zquez and Yuren, street vendors and merchants organizations, the \"uni\u00f3n blanca\" or [[company union]] of streetcar workers composed largely of strikebreakers, a union of [[homeopathy|homeopathic]] doctors, grave diggers and bottling plant workers.\n\nThree other union leaders, Fernando Amilpa, Alfonso Sanchez Madriaga and Luis Quintero, took their unions out of CROM to affiliate with the CSTDF shortly thereafter. When Morones stated that he was glad to be rid of these \"worms,\" a CGT union leader reportedly said, \"They are not worms, but wolves and will soon eat up the chickens in the hutch.\" The five were thereafter known as ''los cinco lobitos'', or \"the five little wolves\".\n\nVel\u00e1zquez played an active role in trade union affairs in the early 1930s: he was a member of the commission that edited the new Federal Labor Law in 1931, took part in proceedings before the Federal Labor Board, which had the power to register unions or declare a strike legal or illegal, and established ties with both the governmental representatives on the Board and with the employers. As a wave of labor militancy came to M\u00e9xico in the wake of the worldwide depression of the 1930s, Vel\u00e1zquez, leaders of the CGT, and Lombardo Toledano, who had also left CROM, founded the Confederaci\u00f3n General de Obreros y Campesinos de M\u00e9xico (CGOCM) or General Confederation of Workers and Peasants of Mexico, on June 28, 1933.\n\n==Founding the CTM==\n[[File:StatueFidelVelazquezDF.JPG|thumb|right| Statue of Fidel Vel\u00e1zquez which stands in front of the [[Instituto del Fondo Nacional de la Vivienda para los Trabajadores|INFONAVIT]] office in Mexico City]]\nThe CGOCM became the most important union body in Mexico, leading a number of strikes in 1934. When President [[L\u00e1zaro C\u00e1rdenas del R\u00edo]] called on unions for support in resisting a threatened coup by Calles and opposing an employers' strike in [[Monterrey]], the CGOCM and the PCM rallied to his defense.\n\nC\u00e1rdenas also called on these unions to form a single unified body. The CGOCM transformed itself into the Confederaci\u00f3n de Trabajadores de M\u00e9xico, or CTM, in response.\n\nThe CTM almost disintegrated at the moment of its formation. While Lombardo Toledano was a convinced [[Stalinism|Stalinist]] and the most important representative of the [[Soviet Union]] in Mexico and [[Latin America]] for the decade after his visit to the Soviet Union in 1935, he was never a member of the PCM. At the founding convention of the CTM, the PCM and the industrial unions it had organized had been promised the position of organizational secretary, the second most powerful position within the CTM. When Lombardo Toledano gave that position to Vel\u00e1zquez, the left unions walked out of the convention. Under pressure to preserve unity, however, they returned and grudgingly assented to Vel\u00e1zquez's election.\n\nThe PCM and its unions almost walked out of the CTM a second time the following year. [[Earl Browder]], then head of the [[Communist Party USA]], urged them to accept \"unity at all costs\", and they returned. The CTM (along with the CGT, CROM and the electrical workers union) formally aligned with the Partido Revolucionario Mexicano, the precursor of the PRI. as its \"labor sector\" in 1938.\n\nAs part of the party, and therefore effectively part of the state, the CTM received a number of tangible benefits. The Federal Labor Boards, which had the power to determine which unions could represent workers and which strikes were legal, consistently favored the CTM against its rivals. Over time, the CTM became dependent on the PRI and the state for financial support as well: the PRI provided CTM with subsidies, while the CTM in return required all workers to join the union recognized at their workplace and, by extension, the PRI. The PRI also provided CTM leaders with positions at all levels of government and reserved at least one Senatorial position for a CTM leader.\n\nOn the other hand, C\u00e1rdenas took steps to ensure that CTM did not acquire so much power that it could be independent of the party. He prohibited the CTM from representing government employees, creating a separate union federation for these workers, and barred the CTM from admitting farm workers to membership.\n\n==Taking over the CTM==\nAs organizational secretary, Vel\u00e1zquez involved himself in the day-to-day decisions of the organization, building up a power base of patronage. When Lombardo Toledano stepped down as general secretary of the CTM at the end of his term, Vel\u00e1zquez took his place on February 28, 1941. In 1946, the CTM joined in forming the new PRI, becoming one of its constituent parts. As the formal division between the PRI and the state was blurred, the distinctions between the CTM and the party and the state likewise became harder to discern.\n\nLombardo Toledano had remained active in the CTM after Vel\u00e1zquez replaced him. That changed, however, after Lombardo Toledano broke with the PRI in 1947, forming the Partido Popular. The CTM not only refused to endorse the new party, but expelled Lombardo Toledano, his supporters on the CTM's executive board, and other leftwing unionists and withdrew from both the [[Confederaci\u00f3n de Trabajadores de Am\u00e9rica Latina]], a regional confederation founded by Lombardo Toledano, and the pro-Soviet [[World Federation of Trade Unions]]. The CTM subsequently affiliated with the [[International Confederation of Free Trade Unions]].\n\n==Remaking Mexican labor==\nVel\u00e1zquez and the CTM then proceeded, with the help of the state, to eliminate independent union leaders in industrial unions such as the miners', petroleum workers' and railroad workers' unions. The state exercised its authority to oust uncooperative union leaders, either by removing them directly or manipulating internal union elections.\n\nThe new leaders were referred to as ''charros'', or \"cowboys\", after Jes\u00fas D\u00edaz de Leon, the leader imposed on the railroad workers union in 1948, who was known for his fondness for the finery associated with [[Charro|Mexican cowboys]]. The government likewise coerced the STPRM, the union that represented the workers at [[PEMEX]], the state-run petroleum enterprise, to accept Gustavo Rold\u00e1n Vargas as its new leader in 1949 and imposed Jes\u00fas Carrasco on the [[SNTMMSRM|Miners and Metal Workers Union]] (the SNTMMSRM) in 1950.\n\nThese heavy-handed efforts did not always go unopposed: when the government installed Carrasco as the head of the SNTMMSRM, a number of locals bolted from the union to form the National Miners Union. When a strike broke out at the Nueva Rosita mine in 1950, the employer prevailed on local businesses to refuse to sell food to the strikers while the government declared martial law in the area, arresting the leaders of the strike, seizing the union's treasury and barring all meetings. The government used similar tactics in 1959, nationalizing the rail industry, firing thousands of strikers and sentencing union leaders to more than ten years in prison for leading a strike.

Many of these unrepresentative unions degenerated into organizations that \"sold\" contracts with a CTM affiliate as a guarantee against representation by independent unions, but which did not function as a union in any meaningful sense.\n\n==The age of dinosaurs==\nThose PRI leaders who remained in power acquired the derisive name of \"dinosaurs\".

The city collected an insurance settlement of almost $900,000 as a result of the cancellation.<ref name=\"TobinRamosSams\" />\n\n== Airlines and destinations ==\n=== Passenger ===\n{{Airport destination list | 3rdcoltitle = Refs | 3rdcolunsortable=yes\n<!--DO NOT ADD TERMINAL/CONCOURSE INFORMATION TO THIS TABLE AS IT VIOLATES [[WP:NOTTRAVEL]]-->\n<!-- -->\n| {{nowrap|[[Air Canada Express]]}} | [[Toronto Pearson International Airport|Toronto\u2013Pearson]] | <ref name=\"AirCanadaRoutes\">{{cite web|title=Flight Schedules|url=https://www.aircanada.com/us/en/aco/home/book/routes-and-partners/flight-schedules.html|accessdate=March 29, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170330083955/https://www.aircanada.com/us/en/aco/home/book/routes-and-partners/flight-schedules.html|archive-date=March 30, 2017|url-status=live}}</ref>\n<!-- -->\n| [[Air Choice One]] | [[McKellar-Sipes Regional Airport|Jackson (TN)]] | <ref name=\"AtlantaGaAirChoiceOne\">{{cite web |title=Flights to Atlanta, GA |url=https://www.airchoiceone.com/destinations/flights-to-atlanta-ga/ |publisher=Air Choice One |access-date=March 2, 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180302104102/https://www.airchoiceone.com/destinations/flights-to-atlanta-ga/ |archive-date=March 2, 2018 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n<!-- -->\n| [[Air France]] | [[Charles de Gaulle Airport|Paris\u2013Charles de Gaulle]] | <ref name=\"AirFranceRoutes\">{{cite web|title=Horaires|url=https://www.airfrance.co.uk/GB/en/local/resainfovol/horaires/horaires.do|accessdate=March 29, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170419122802/http://www.airfrance.co.uk/GB/en/local/resainfovol/horaires/horaires.do|archive-date=April 19, 2017|url-status=live}}</ref>\n<!-- -->\n| [[Alaska Airlines]] | [[Seattle\u2013Tacoma International Airport|Seattle/Tacoma]] | <ref name=\"AlaskaRoutes\">{{cite web|title=Flight timetable|url=https://www.alaskaair.com/content/travel-info/timetables.aspx|website=Alaskaair.com|accessdate=March 29, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170202123138/https://www.alaskaair.com/content/travel-info/timetables.aspx|archive-date=February 2, 2017|url-status=live}}</ref>\n<!-- -->\n| [[American Airlines]] | [[Charlotte Douglas International Airport|Charlotte]], [[O'Hare International Airport|Chicago\u2013O'Hare]], [[Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport|Dallas/Fort Worth]], [[Los Angeles International Airport|Los Angeles]], [[Miami International Airport|Miami]], [[LaGuardia Airport|New York\u2013LaGuardia]], [[Philadelphia International Airport|Philadelphia]], [[Phoenix Sky Harbor International Airport|Phoenix\u2013Sky Harbor]], [[Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport|Washington\u2013National]] | <ref name=\"AmericanRoutes\">{{cite web|title=Flight schedules and notifications|url=https://www.aa.com/travelInformation/flights/schedule|accessdate=March 29, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170202010611/https://www.aa.com/travelInformation/flights/schedule|archive-date=February 2, 2017|url-status=live}}</ref>\n<!-- -->\n| [[American Eagle (airline brand)|American Eagle]] | [[Charlotte Douglas International Airport|Charlotte]], [[Miami International Airport|Miami]], [[LaGuardia Airport|New York\u2013LaGuardia]], [[Philadelphia International Airport|Philadelphia]], [[Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport|Washington\u2013National]]<br />'''Seasonal:''' [[O'Hare International Airport|Chicago\u2013O'Hare]] | <ref name=\"AmericanRoutes\" />\n<!-- -->\n| [[Boutique Air]] | [[Mid-Delta Regional Airport|Greenville (MS)]], [[Northwest Alabama Regional Airport|Muscle Shoals]] | <ref name=\"BoutiqueRoutes\">{{cite web|title=Route Map and Schedule|url=https://www.boutiqueair.com/p/schedule|website=Boutiqueair.com|accessdate=March 29, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161205023354/https://www.boutiqueair.com/p/schedule|archive-date=December 5, 2016|url-status=live}}</ref>\n<!-- -->\n| [[British Airways]] | [[Heathrow Airport|London\u2013Heathrow]] | <ref name=\"BritishRoutes\">{{cite web|title=Timetables|url=https://www.britishairways.com/travel/schedules/public/en_gb|website=Britishairways.com|accessdate=March 29, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170330083400/https://www.britishairways.com/travel/schedules/public/en_gb|archive-date=March 30, 2017|url-status=live}}</ref>\n<!-- -->\n| {{nowrap|[[Delta Air Lines]]}} | [[Akron\u2013Canton Airport|Akron/Canton]], [[Albany International Airport|Albany (NY)]], [[Albuquerque International Sunport|Albuquerque]], [[Lehigh Valley International Airport|Allentown]], [[Amsterdam Airport Schiphol|Amsterdam]], [[Appleton International Airport|Appleton]], [[Queen Beatrix International Airport|Aruba]], [[Asheville Regional Airport|Asheville]], [[Augusta Regional Airport|Augusta (GA)]], [[Austin\u2013Bergstrom International Airport|Austin]], [[Baltimore\u2013Washington International Airport|Baltimore]], [[Philip S.

It has since become a widespread, highly technical form of dance with its own [[Glossary of ballet|vocabulary based on French terminology]]. It has been globally influential and has defined the foundational [[ballet technique|techniques]] used in many other dance genres and cultures. Ballet has been taught in various schools around the world, which have historically incorporated their own cultures and as a result, the art has evolved in a number of distinct ways. See [[glossary of ballet]].\n\nA '''''ballet''''', a [[work of art|work]], consists of the [[choreography (dance)|choreography]] and [[music]] for a ballet production. Ballets are choreographed and performed by trained [[ballet dancer]]s. Traditional [[classical ballet]]s are usually performed with [[classical music]] accompaniment and use elaborate costumes and staging, whereas modern ballets, such as the [[Neoclassical ballet|neoclassical]] works of American choreographer [[George Balanchine]], are often performed in simple costumes (e.g., leotards and tights) and without the use of elaborate sets or scenery.\n\n==Etymology==\nBallet is a French word which had its origin in Italian ''balletto'', a [[diminutive]] of ''ballo'' (dance) which comes from [[Latin]] ''ballo'', ''ballare'', meaning \"to dance\",<ref name=\"chantrell\" /><ref name=\"perseus\" /> which in turn comes from the [[Greek language|Greek]] \"\u03b2\u03b1\u03bb\u03bb\u03af\u03b6\u03c9\" (''ballizo''), \"to dance, to jump about\".<ref name=\"perseus\" /><ref name=\"harper\" /> The word came into English usage from the French around 1630.\n\n==History==\n{{Main|History of ballet|Timeline of ballet}}\n[[File:Ballet de la nuit 1653.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Louis XIV of France|Louis XIV]] as Apollo in the ''[[Ballet Royal de la Nuit]]'' (1653)]]\nBallet originated in the [[Italian Renaissance]] courts of the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries.

Perhaps the most widely known and performed ballet style is late [[Romantic ballet]] (or [[Ballet blanc]]).\n\n=== Classical ballet ===\n{{main|Classical ballet}}\n[[File:Swanlake015.jpg|thumb|The ''Valse des cygnes'' from Act II of the Ivanov/Petipa edition of ''Swan Lake'']]\nClassical ballet is based on traditional ballet [[Glossary of ballet|technique and vocabulary]].<ref>{{Cite book|title=Technical Manual and Dictionary of Classical Ballet|last=Grant|first=Gail|publisher=[[Dover Publications]]|year=1982|isbn=978-0-486-21843-4|location=New York, US|pages=|url=https://archive.org/details/technicalmanuald00gail}}</ref> Different styles have emerged in different countries, such as [[French ballet]], [[Italian ballet]], [[English ballet]], and [[Russian ballet]]. Several of the classical ballet styles are associated with specific training methods, typically named after their creators (see below).  The [[Royal Academy of Dance|Royal Academy of Dance method]] is a ballet technique and training system that was founded by a diverse group of ballet dancers. They merged their respective dance methods (Italian, French, Danish and Russian) to create a new style of ballet that is unique to the organization and is recognized internationally as the English style of ballet.<ref name=\":4\" /> Some examples of classical ballet productions are: ''[[Swan Lake]]'', ''[[The Sleeping Beauty (ballet)|The Sleeping Beauty]]'' and ''[[The Nutcracker]].''\n\n===Romantic ballet===\n{{main|Romantic ballet}}\n[[File:Giselle -Carlotta Grisi -1841 -2.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Carlotta Grisi]], the original [[Giselle]], 1841, wearing the romantic tutu]]\nRomantic ballet was an artistic movement of classical ballet and several productions remain in the classical repertoire today. The Romantic era was marked by the emergence of [[Pointe technique|pointe]] work, the dominance of female dancers, and longer, flowy tutus that attempt to exemplify softness and a delicate aura.<ref name=\":0\" /> This movement occurred during the early to mid-nineteenth century (the [[Romantic era]]) and featured themes that emphasized intense emotion as a source of [[aesthetic]] experience. The plots of many romantic ballets revolved around spirit women (sylphs, wilis, and ghosts) who enslaved the hearts and senses of mortal men. The 1827 ballet ''[[La Sylphide]]'' is widely considered to be the first, and the 1870 ballet ''[[Copp\u00e9lia]]'' is considered to be the last.<ref name=\":3\" /> Famous ballet dancers of the Romantic era include [[Marie Taglioni]], [[Fanny Elssler]], and [[Jules Perrot]]. Jules Perrot is also known for his choreography, especially that of [[Giselle]], often considered to be the most widely celebrated romantic ballet.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n===Neoclassical ballet===\n{{main|Neoclassical ballet}}\nNeoclassical ballet is usually abstract, with no clear plot, costumes or scenery. Music choice can be diverse and will often include [[Neoclassicism (music)|music that is also neoclassical]] (e.g. [[Igor Stravinsky|Stravinsky]], [[Albert Roussel|Roussel]]). Tim Scholl, author of ''From Petipa to Balanchine'', considers [[George Balanchine]]'s ''[[Apollo (ballet)|Apollo]]'' in 1928 to be the first neoclassical ballet. ''Apollo'' represented a return to form in response to [[Sergei Diaghilev]]'s abstract ballets. Balanchine worked with modern dance choreographer [[Martha Graham]], and brought modern dancers into his company such as [[Paul Taylor (choreographer)|Paul Taylor]], who in 1959 performed in Balanchine's ''[[Episodes (ballet)|Episodes]]''.<ref>{{Cite book|title=From Petipa to Balanchine: Classical Revival and the Modernization of Ballet|last=Scholl|first=Tim|publisher=[[Routledge]]|year=1994|isbn=978-0415756211|location=London|pages=}}</ref>\n\nWhile Balanchine is widely considered the face of neoclassical ballet, there were others who made significant contributions. [[Frederick Ashton]]\u2019s ''[[Symphonic Variations (ballet)|Symphonic Variations]]'' (1946) is a seminal work for the choreographer. Set to [[C\u00e9sar Franck]]\u2019s score of the same title, it is a pure-dance interpretation of the score.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nAnother form, [[Modern ballet|Modern Ballet]], also emerged as an offshoot of neoclassicism. Among the innovators in this form were [[Glen Tetley]], [[Robert Joffrey]] and [[Gerald Arpino]]. While difficult to parse modern ballet from neoclassicism, the work of these choreographers favored a greater athleticism that departed from the delicacy of ballet. The physicality was more daring, with mood, subject matter and music more intense. An example of this would be Joffrey's ''Astarte'' (1967), which featured a rock score and sexual overtones in the choreography.<ref name=\":4\" />\n\n===Contemporary ballet===\n{{main|Contemporary ballet}}\n[[File:Grace in winter, contemporary ballet.jpg|thumb|A ballet leap performed with modern, non-classical form in a contemporary ballet]]\nThis ballet style is often performed barefoot. Contemporary ballets may include [[Mime artist|mime]] and [[acting]], and are usually set to music (typically orchestral but occasionally vocal). It can be difficult to differentiate this form from neoclassical or modern ballet. Contemporary ballet is also close to [[contemporary dance]] because many contemporary ballet concepts come from the ideas and innovations of twentieth-century modern dance, including floor work and turn-in of the legs. The main distinction is that ballet technique is essential to perform a contemporary ballet.\n\nGeorge Balanchine is considered to have been a pioneer of contemporary ballet. Another early contemporary ballet choreographer, [[Twyla Tharp]], choreographed ''Push Comes To Shove'' for the [[American Ballet Theatre]] in 1976, and in 1986 created ''In The Upper Room'' for her own company. Both of these pieces were considered innovative for their melding of distinctly modern movements with the use of pointe shoes and classically trained dancers.\n\nToday there are many contemporary ballet companies and choreographers. These include [[Alonzo King]] and his company [[Alonzo King LINES Ballet|LINES Ballet]]; [[Matthew Bourne]] and his company [[New Adventures]]; [[Complexions Contemporary Ballet]]; [[Nacho Duato]] and his [[Compa\u00f1ia Nacional de Danza]]; William Forsythe and [[The Forsythe Company]]; and [[Ji\u0159\u00ed Kyli\u00e1n]] of the [[Nederlands Dans Theater]]. Traditionally \"classical\" companies, such as the Mariinsky (Kirov) Ballet and the Paris Opera Ballet, also regularly perform contemporary works.\n\nThe term ''ballet'' has evolved to include all forms associated with it. Someone training as a ballet dancer will now be expected to perform neoclassical, modern and contemporary work. A ballet dancer is expected to be able to be stately and regal for classical work, free and lyrical in neoclassical work, and unassuming, harsh or pedestrian for modern and contemporary work. In addition, there are several modern varieties of dance that fuse classical ballet technique with contemporary dance, such as [[Hiplet (dance style)|Hiplet]], that require dancers to be practised in non-Western dance styles.<ref name=kourlas>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/09/04/arts/dance/hiplet-an-implausible-hybrid-plants-itself-on-pointe.html|title=Hiplet: An Implausible Hybrid Plants Itself on Pointe|last=Kourlas|first=Gia|date=2016-09-02|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|issn=0362-4331|access-date=2016-12-03|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161221165024/http://www.nytimes.com/2016/09/04/arts/dance/hiplet-an-implausible-hybrid-plants-itself-on-pointe.html|archivedate=2016-12-21}}</ref>\n\n== Technical methods of ballet instruction ==\nThere are six widely used, internationally recognized methods to teach or study ballet. These methods are the [[French ballet|French School]], the [[Vaganova method|Vaganova Method]], the [[Cecchetti method|Cecchetti Method]], the [[Bournonville method]], the [[Royal Academy of Dance|Royal Academy of Dance method]] (English style), and the [[Balanchine method]] (American style). Many more schools of technique exist in various countries.\n\nAlthough preschool-age children are a lucrative source of income for a ballet studio, ballet instruction is generally not an age-appropriate for young children.<ref>{{Cite news|last=Kaufman|first=Sarah L.

When Louis XIV created the [[Acad\u00e9mie Royale de Danse]] in 1661, he helped to create the codified technique still used today by those in the profession, regardless of what method of training they adhere to. The French school was particularly revitalized under [[Rudolf Nureyev]], in the 1980s. His influence revitalized and renewed appreciation for this style, and has drastically shaped ballet as a whole.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.tututix.com/ballet-methods-what-are-they/|title=Ballet Methods: What Are They? {{!}} TutuTix|date=2016-05-09|work=[[TutuTix]]|access-date=2017-07-26|language=en-US|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171111202705/https://www.tututix.com/ballet-methods-what-are-they/|archivedate=2017-11-11}}</ref>  In fact, the French school is now sometimes referred to as Nureyev school. The French method is often characterized by technical precision, fluidity and gracefulness, and elegant, clean lines. For this style, fast footwork is often utilized in order to give the impression that the performers are drifting lightly across the stage.<ref name=\":2\">{{cite web|url=http://www.ottawaballetschool.com/Ballet-Methods.html|title=Different Ballet Methods|website=www.ottawaballetschool.com|access-date=2017-07-26|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170711192342/http://www.ottawaballetschool.com/Ballet-Methods.html|archivedate=2017-07-11}}</ref> Two important trademarks of this technique are the specific way in which the port de bras and the \u00e9paulement are performed, more rounded than when dancing in a Russian style, but not as rounded as the Danish style.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.dancespirit.com/the_paris_opara_ballet_school-2326043328.html|title=The Paris Op\u00e9ra Ballet School|date=2010-01-01|work=[[Dance Spirit]]|access-date=2017-07-26|language=en|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171111202705/http://www.dancespirit.com/the_paris_opara_ballet_school-2326043328.html|archivedate=2017-11-11}}</ref>\n\n=== Vaganova method ===\n[[File:Agrippina Vaganova -Esmeralda 1910.jpg|left|thumb|upright|Agrippina Vaganova, \"Esmeralda\" 1910]]\nThe [[Vaganova method]] is a style of ballet training that emerged from [[Russian ballet]], created by [[Agrippina Vaganova]]. After retiring from dance in 1916, Vaganova turned to teaching at the Leningrad Choreographic School in 1921. Her training method is now internationally recognized and her book, ''The Fundamentals of Classical Dance'' (1934), is a classic reference. This method is marked by the fusion of the classical French style, specifically elements from the Romantic era, with the athleticism of the Italian method, and the soulful passion of Russian ballet.<ref name=\":2\"/> She developed an extremely precise method of instruction in her book ''Basic Principles of Russian Classical dance'' (1948). This includes outlining when to teach technical components to students in their ballet careers, for how long to focus on it, and the right amount of focus at each stage of the student's career. These textbooks continue to be extremely important to the instruction of ballet today.\n\nThe method emphasizes development of strength, flexibility, and endurance for the proper performance of ballet. She espoused the belief that equal importance should be placed on the arms and legs while performing ballet, as this will bring harmony and greater expression to the body as a whole.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ibtacademy.org/content/Vaganova-at-IBT|title=Vaganova Method|language=ru|access-date=2017-07-26|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171111202706/http://ibtacademy.org/content/Vaganova-at-IBT|publisher=[[International Ballet Theater Academy]] ibtacademy.org|archivedate=2017-11-11}}</ref>\n\n=== Cecchetti method ===\n[[File:Cecchetti jpg.gif|thumb|upright|Enrico Cecchetti with Anna Pavlova]]\nDeveloped by [[Enrico Cecchetti]] (1850-1928), this method is one known internationally for its intense reliance of the understanding of anatomy as it relates to classical ballet. The goal of this method is to instill important characteristics for the performance of ballet into students so that they do not need to rely on imitations of teachers. Important components for this method is the emphasis of balance, elevations, [[Ballon (ballet)|ballon]], poise, and strength.\n\nThis method espouses the importance of recognizing that all parts of the body move together to  create beautiful, graceful lines, and as such cautions against thinking of ballet in terms of the arms, legs, and neck and torso as separate parts. This method is well known for eight port de bras that are utilized.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\n=== Bournonville method ===\n[[File:August Bournonville by E. Lange.jpg|left|thumb|upright|August Bournonville]]\nThe Bournonville method is a Danish method first devised by [[August Bournonville]]. Bournonville was heavily influenced by the early French ballet method due to his training with his father, [[Antoine Bournonville]] and other important French ballet masters. This method has many style differences that differentiate it from other ballet methods taught today.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bournonville.com/bournonville46.html|title=Bournonville.com|website=www.bournonville.com|access-date=2017-07-26|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171027025043/http://bournonville.com/bournonville46.html|archivedate=2017-10-27}}</ref> A key component is the use of diagonal  \u00e9paulements, with the upper body turning towards the working foot typically. This method also incorporates very basic use of arms, pirouettes from a low d\u00e9velopp\u00e9 position into seconde, and use of fifth position bras en bas for the beginning and end of movements.\n\nThe Bournonville method produces dancers who have beautiful ''ballon'' (\"the illusion of imponderable lightness\"<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.balletposition.com/blog/the-danish-way-of-dancing-it-all-started-with-bournonville|title=Bournonville: The Danish Way of Dancing - Ballet Position|date=2016-06-17|work=Ballet Position|access-date=2018-09-11|language=en-GB|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180910191614/http://www.balletposition.com/blog/the-danish-way-of-dancing-it-all-started-with-bournonville|archive-date=2018-09-10|url-status=live}}</ref>).\n\n[[File:Young girls competing at the Royal Academy of Dancing (London) exams held in Brisbane and Toowoomba, 1938 (7946600826).jpg|thumb|Young girls competing at the Royal Academy of Dancing (London) exams held in Brisbane and Toowoomba, 1938]]\n\n=== The Royal Academy of Dance method (RAD) ===\nThe [[Royal Academy of Dance|Royal Academy of Dance method]], also referred to as the English style of ballet, was established in 1920 by Genee, Karsavina, Bedells, E Espinosa, and Richardson. The goal of this method is to promote academic training in classical ballet throughout Great Britain. This style also spread to the United States, and is widely utilized still today. There are specific grade levels which a student must move through in order to complete training in this method.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dancevillage.com/en/dance-methods/royal-academy-dance.php|title=Ballet Training Techniques - The Royal Academy of Dance (RAD) - DANCE VILLAGE - dance portal and online community|website=www.dancevillage.com|language=en|access-date=2017-07-26|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160227063431/http://www.dancevillage.com/en/dance-methods/royal-academy-dance.php|archivedate=2016-02-27}}</ref> The key principle behind this method of instruction is that basic ballet technique must be taught at a slow pace, with difficulty progression often much slower than the rest of the methods. The idea behind this is if a student is to put in a large amount of effort into perfecting the basic steps, the technique learned in these steps allow a student to utilize harder ones at a much easier rate.<ref name=\":2\"/>\n\n=== Balanchine method ===\n[[File:Suzanne Farrell and George Balanchine NYWTS.jpg|left|thumb|[[Suzanne Farrell]] and [[George Balanchine]] dancing in a segment of \"Don Quixote\" at New York State Theater]]\nDeveloped by [[George Balanchine]] at the [[New York City Ballet]]. His method draws heavily on his own training as a dancer in Russia. The technique is known for extreme speed throughout routines, emphasis on lines, and deep pli\u00e9s. Perhaps one of the most well known differences of this style is the unorthodox positioning of the body.<ref name=\":2\"/> Dancers of this style often have flexed hands and even feet, and are placed in off-balance positions. Important ballet studios teaching this method are the [[Miami City Ballet]], Ballet Chicago Studio company, and the [[School of American Ballet]] in New York.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://dancelessons.net/dancehistory/HistoryofBalletDance.html|title=History of Ballet Dance - Dance History Articles|website=dancelessons.net|access-date=2017-07-26|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170222002745/http://dancelessons.net/dancehistory/HistoryofBalletDance.html|archivedate=2017-02-22}}</ref>\n\n== Costumes ==\n[[File:Anna Pavlova 1912.jpg|alt=Prima Ballerina, Anna Pavlova|thumb|upright|Anna Pavlova (prima ballerina); Early materials for ballet costumes were heavy, hindering the dancer's movements]]\nBallet costumes play an important role in the ballet community.

Ballet costumes have been around since the early fifteenth century. Cotton and silk were mixed with flax, woven into semitransparent gauze<ref name=\"tutuetoile.com\"/> to create exquisite ballet costumes.\n\n=== Seventeenth century ===\nDuring the seventeenth century, different types of fabrics and designs were used to make costumes more spectacular and eye catching. Court dress still remained for women during this century. Silks, satins and fabrics embroidered with real gold and precious stones increased the level of spectacular decoration associated with ballet costumes.<ref name=\"tutuetoile.com\"/> Women's costumes also consisted of heavy garments and knee-long skirts which made it difficult for them to create much movement and gesture.\n\n=== Eighteenth century ===\nDuring the eighteenth century, stage costumes were still very similar to court wear but progressed over time, mostly due to the French dancer and ballet-master [[Jean-Georges Noverre]] (1727\u20131810) whose proposals to modernize ballet are contained in his revolutionary ''Lettres sur la danse et les ballets'' (1760). Noverre's book altered the emphasis in a production away from the costumes towards the physical movements and emotions of the dancers.\n\nEuropean ballet was centered in the [[Paris Opera]].<ref name=\"tutuetoile.com\"/> During this era, skirts were raised a few inches off the ground.  Flowers, flounces, ribbons, and lace emphasized this opulent feminine style, as soft pastel tones in citron, peach, pink and pistachio dominated the color range.<ref name=\"tutuetoile.com\"/>\n\n=== Nineteenth century ===\n[[File:Olga Spessiva in Swan Lake costume, 1934 photographer Sydney Fox Studio, 3rd Floor, 88 King St, Sydney.jpg|thumb|upright|Olga Spessiva; Swan Lake Costume in the twentieth century]]\nDuring the early nineteenth century, close-fitting body costumes, floral crowns, corsages and jewels were used. Ideals of Romanticism were reflected through female movements.<ref name=\"tutuetoile.com\"/>\n\nCostumes became much tighter as corsets started to come into use, to show off the curves on a ballerina. Jewels and bedazzled costumes became much more popular.\n\n=== Twentieth century ===\nDuring the twentieth century, ballet costumes transitioned back to the influence of Russian ballet. Ballerina skirts became knee-length tutus, later on in order to show off their precise pointe work. Colors used on stage costumes also became much more vibrant. Designers used colors such as red, orange, yellow, etc. to create visual expression when ballet dancers perform on stage.\n\n==Ballet as a career==\nProfessional dancers are generally not well paid.

It has since become a widespread, highly technical form of dance with its own [[Glossary of ballet|vocabulary based on French terminology]]. It has been globally influential and has defined the foundational [[ballet technique|techniques]] used in many other dance genres and cultures. Ballet has been taught in various schools around the world, which have historically incorporated their own cultures and as a result, the art has evolved in a number of distinct ways. See [[glossary of ballet]].\n\nA '''''ballet''''', a [[work of art|work]], consists of the [[choreography (dance)|choreography]] and [[music]] for a ballet production. Ballets are choreographed and performed by trained [[ballet dancer]]s. Traditional [[classical ballet]]s are usually performed with [[classical music]] accompaniment and use elaborate costumes and staging, whereas modern ballets, such as the [[Neoclassical ballet|neoclassical]] works of American choreographer [[George Balanchine]], are often performed in simple costumes (e.g., leotards and tights) and without the use of elaborate sets or scenery.\n\n==Etymology==\nBallet is a French word which had its origin in Italian ''balletto'', a [[diminutive]] of ''ballo'' (dance) which comes from [[Latin]] ''ballo'', ''ballare'', meaning \"to dance\",<ref name=\"chantrell\" /><ref name=\"perseus\" /> which in turn comes from the [[Greek language|Greek]] \"\u03b2\u03b1\u03bb\u03bb\u03af\u03b6\u03c9\" (''ballizo''), \"to dance, to jump about\".<ref name=\"perseus\" /><ref name=\"harper\" /> The word came into English usage from the French around 1630.\n\n==History==\n{{Main|History of ballet|Timeline of ballet}}\n[[File:Ballet de la nuit 1653.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Louis XIV of France|Louis XIV]] as Apollo in the ''[[Ballet Royal de la Nuit]]'' (1653)]]\nBallet originated in the [[Italian Renaissance]] courts of the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries.

Early, classical variations are primarily associated with geographic origin. Examples of this are [[Russian ballet]], [[French ballet]], and [[Italian ballet]]. Later variations, such as contemporary ballet and neoclassical ballet, incorporate both classical ballet and non-traditional technique and movement. Perhaps the most widely known and performed ballet style is late [[Romantic ballet]] (or [[Ballet blanc]]).\n\n=== Classical ballet ===\n{{main|Classical ballet}}\n[[File:Swanlake015.jpg|thumb|The ''Valse des cygnes'' from Act II of the Ivanov/Petipa edition of ''Swan Lake'']]\nClassical ballet is based on traditional ballet [[Glossary of ballet|technique and vocabulary]].<ref>{{Cite book|title=Technical Manual and Dictionary of Classical Ballet|last=Grant|first=Gail|publisher=[[Dover Publications]]|year=1982|isbn=978-0-486-21843-4|location=New York, US|pages=|url=https://archive.org/details/technicalmanuald00gail}}</ref> Different styles have emerged in different countries, such as [[French ballet]], [[Italian ballet]], [[English ballet]], and [[Russian ballet]]. Several of the classical ballet styles are associated with specific training methods, typically named after their creators (see below).  The [[Royal Academy of Dance|Royal Academy of Dance method]] is a ballet technique and training system that was founded by a diverse group of ballet dancers. They merged their respective dance methods (Italian, French, Danish and Russian) to create a new style of ballet that is unique to the organization and is recognized internationally as the English style of ballet.<ref name=\":4\" /> Some examples of classical ballet productions are: ''[[Swan Lake]]'', ''[[The Sleeping Beauty (ballet)|The Sleeping Beauty]]'' and ''[[The Nutcracker]].''\n\n===Romantic ballet===\n{{main|Romantic ballet}}\n[[File:Giselle -Carlotta Grisi -1841 -2.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Carlotta Grisi]], the original [[Giselle]], 1841, wearing the romantic tutu]]\nRomantic ballet was an artistic movement of classical ballet and several productions remain in the classical repertoire today. The Romantic era was marked by the emergence of [[Pointe technique|pointe]] work, the dominance of female dancers, and longer, flowy tutus that attempt to exemplify softness and a delicate aura.<ref name=\":0\" /> This movement occurred during the early to mid-nineteenth century (the [[Romantic era]]) and featured themes that emphasized intense emotion as a source of [[aesthetic]] experience. The plots of many romantic ballets revolved around spirit women (sylphs, wilis, and ghosts) who enslaved the hearts and senses of mortal men. The 1827 ballet ''[[La Sylphide]]'' is widely considered to be the first, and the 1870 ballet ''[[Copp\u00e9lia]]'' is considered to be the last.<ref name=\":3\" /> Famous ballet dancers of the Romantic era include [[Marie Taglioni]], [[Fanny Elssler]], and [[Jules Perrot]]. Jules Perrot is also known for his choreography, especially that of [[Giselle]], often considered to be the most widely celebrated romantic ballet.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n===Neoclassical ballet===\n{{main|Neoclassical ballet}}\nNeoclassical ballet is usually abstract, with no clear plot, costumes or scenery. Music choice can be diverse and will often include [[Neoclassicism (music)|music that is also neoclassical]] (e.g. [[Igor Stravinsky|Stravinsky]], [[Albert Roussel|Roussel]]). Tim Scholl, author of ''From Petipa to Balanchine'', considers [[George Balanchine]]'s ''[[Apollo (ballet)|Apollo]]'' in 1928 to be the first neoclassical ballet. ''Apollo'' represented a return to form in response to [[Sergei Diaghilev]]'s abstract ballets. Balanchine worked with modern dance choreographer [[Martha Graham]], and brought modern dancers into his company such as [[Paul Taylor (choreographer)|Paul Taylor]], who in 1959 performed in Balanchine's ''[[Episodes (ballet)|Episodes]]''.<ref>{{Cite book|title=From Petipa to Balanchine: Classical Revival and the Modernization of Ballet|last=Scholl|first=Tim|publisher=[[Routledge]]|year=1994|isbn=978-0415756211|location=London|pages=}}</ref>\n\nWhile Balanchine is widely considered the face of neoclassical ballet, there were others who made significant contributions. [[Frederick Ashton]]\u2019s ''[[Symphonic Variations (ballet)|Symphonic Variations]]'' (1946) is a seminal work for the choreographer. Set to [[C\u00e9sar Franck]]\u2019s score of the same title, it is a pure-dance interpretation of the score.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nAnother form, [[Modern ballet|Modern Ballet]], also emerged as an offshoot of neoclassicism. Among the innovators in this form were [[Glen Tetley]], [[Robert Joffrey]] and [[Gerald Arpino]]. While difficult to parse modern ballet from neoclassicism, the work of these choreographers favored a greater athleticism that departed from the delicacy of ballet. The physicality was more daring, with mood, subject matter and music more intense. An example of this would be Joffrey's ''Astarte'' (1967), which featured a rock score and sexual overtones in the choreography.<ref name=\":4\" />\n\n===Contemporary ballet===\n{{main|Contemporary ballet}}\n[[File:Grace in winter, contemporary ballet.jpg|thumb|A ballet leap performed with modern, non-classical form in a contemporary ballet]]\nThis ballet style is often performed barefoot. Contemporary ballets may include [[Mime artist|mime]] and [[acting]], and are usually set to music (typically orchestral but occasionally vocal). It can be difficult to differentiate this form from neoclassical or modern ballet. Contemporary ballet is also close to [[contemporary dance]] because many contemporary ballet concepts come from the ideas and innovations of twentieth-century modern dance, including floor work and turn-in of the legs. The main distinction is that ballet technique is essential to perform a contemporary ballet.\n\nGeorge Balanchine is considered to have been a pioneer of contemporary ballet. Another early contemporary ballet choreographer, [[Twyla Tharp]], choreographed ''Push Comes To Shove'' for the [[American Ballet Theatre]] in 1976, and in 1986 created ''In The Upper Room'' for her own company. Both of these pieces were considered innovative for their melding of distinctly modern movements with the use of pointe shoes and classically trained dancers.\n\nToday there are many contemporary ballet companies and choreographers. These include [[Alonzo King]] and his company [[Alonzo King LINES Ballet|LINES Ballet]]; [[Matthew Bourne]] and his company [[New Adventures]]; [[Complexions Contemporary Ballet]]; [[Nacho Duato]] and his [[Compa\u00f1ia Nacional de Danza]]; William Forsythe and [[The Forsythe Company]]; and [[Ji\u0159\u00ed Kyli\u00e1n]] of the [[Nederlands Dans Theater]]. Traditionally \"classical\" companies, such as the Mariinsky (Kirov) Ballet and the Paris Opera Ballet, also regularly perform contemporary works.\n\nThe term ''ballet'' has evolved to include all forms associated with it. Someone training as a ballet dancer will now be expected to perform neoclassical, modern and contemporary work. A ballet dancer is expected to be able to be stately and regal for classical work, free and lyrical in neoclassical work, and unassuming, harsh or pedestrian for modern and contemporary work. In addition, there are several modern varieties of dance that fuse classical ballet technique with contemporary dance, such as [[Hiplet (dance style)|Hiplet]], that require dancers to be practised in non-Western dance styles.<ref name=kourlas>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/09/04/arts/dance/hiplet-an-implausible-hybrid-plants-itself-on-pointe.html|title=Hiplet: An Implausible Hybrid Plants Itself on Pointe|last=Kourlas|first=Gia|date=2016-09-02|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|issn=0362-4331|access-date=2016-12-03|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161221165024/http://www.nytimes.com/2016/09/04/arts/dance/hiplet-an-implausible-hybrid-plants-itself-on-pointe.html|archivedate=2016-12-21}}</ref>\n\n== Technical methods of ballet instruction ==\nThere are six widely used, internationally recognized methods to teach or study ballet. These methods are the [[French ballet|French School]], the [[Vaganova method|Vaganova Method]], the [[Cecchetti method|Cecchetti Method]], the [[Bournonville method]], the [[Royal Academy of Dance|Royal Academy of Dance method]] (English style), and the [[Balanchine method]] (American style).

When Louis XIV created the [[Acad\u00e9mie Royale de Danse]] in 1661, he helped to create the codified technique still used today by those in the profession, regardless of what method of training they adhere to. The French school was particularly revitalized under [[Rudolf Nureyev]], in the 1980s. His influence revitalized and renewed appreciation for this style, and has drastically shaped ballet as a whole.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.tututix.com/ballet-methods-what-are-they/|title=Ballet Methods: What Are They? {{!}} TutuTix|date=2016-05-09|work=[[TutuTix]]|access-date=2017-07-26|language=en-US|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171111202705/https://www.tututix.com/ballet-methods-what-are-they/|archivedate=2017-11-11}}</ref>  In fact, the French school is now sometimes referred to as Nureyev school.

After retiring from dance in 1916, Vaganova turned to teaching at the Leningrad Choreographic School in 1921. Her training method is now internationally recognized and her book, ''The Fundamentals of Classical Dance'' (1934), is a classic reference. This method is marked by the fusion of the classical French style, specifically elements from the Romantic era, with the athleticism of the Italian method, and the soulful passion of Russian ballet.<ref name=\":2\"/> She developed an extremely precise method of instruction in her book ''Basic Principles of Russian Classical dance'' (1948). This includes outlining when to teach technical components to students in their ballet careers, for how long to focus on it, and the right amount of focus at each stage of the student's career. These textbooks continue to be extremely important to the instruction of ballet today.\n\nThe method emphasizes development of strength, flexibility, and endurance for the proper performance of ballet. She espoused the belief that equal importance should be placed on the arms and legs while performing ballet, as this will bring harmony and greater expression to the body as a whole.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ibtacademy.org/content/Vaganova-at-IBT|title=Vaganova Method|language=ru|access-date=2017-07-26|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171111202706/http://ibtacademy.org/content/Vaganova-at-IBT|publisher=[[International Ballet Theater Academy]] ibtacademy.org|archivedate=2017-11-11}}</ref>\n\n=== Cecchetti method ===\n[[File:Cecchetti jpg.gif|thumb|upright|Enrico Cecchetti with Anna Pavlova]]\nDeveloped by [[Enrico Cecchetti]] (1850-1928), this method is one known internationally for its intense reliance of the understanding of anatomy as it relates to classical ballet. The goal of this method is to instill important characteristics for the performance of ballet into students so that they do not need to rely on imitations of teachers. Important components for this method is the emphasis of balance, elevations, [[Ballon (ballet)|ballon]], poise, and strength.\n\nThis method espouses the importance of recognizing that all parts of the body move together to  create beautiful, graceful lines, and as such cautions against thinking of ballet in terms of the arms, legs, and neck and torso as separate parts. This method is well known for eight port de bras that are utilized.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\n=== Bournonville method ===\n[[File:August Bournonville by E. Lange.jpg|left|thumb|upright|August Bournonville]]\nThe Bournonville method is a Danish method first devised by [[August Bournonville]]. Bournonville was heavily influenced by the early French ballet method due to his training with his father, [[Antoine Bournonville]] and other important French ballet masters. This method has many style differences that differentiate it from other ballet methods taught today.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bournonville.com/bournonville46.html|title=Bournonville.com|website=www.bournonville.com|access-date=2017-07-26|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171027025043/http://bournonville.com/bournonville46.html|archivedate=2017-10-27}}</ref> A key component is the use of diagonal  \u00e9paulements, with the upper body turning towards the working foot typically. This method also incorporates very basic use of arms, pirouettes from a low d\u00e9velopp\u00e9 position into seconde, and use of fifth position bras en bas for the beginning and end of movements.\n\nThe Bournonville method produces dancers who have beautiful ''ballon'' (\"the illusion of imponderable lightness\"<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.balletposition.com/blog/the-danish-way-of-dancing-it-all-started-with-bournonville|title=Bournonville: The Danish Way of Dancing - Ballet Position|date=2016-06-17|work=Ballet Position|access-date=2018-09-11|language=en-GB|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180910191614/http://www.balletposition.com/blog/the-danish-way-of-dancing-it-all-started-with-bournonville|archive-date=2018-09-10|url-status=live}}</ref>).\n\n[[File:Young girls competing at the Royal Academy of Dancing (London) exams held in Brisbane and Toowoomba, 1938 (7946600826).jpg|thumb|Young girls competing at the Royal Academy of Dancing (London) exams held in Brisbane and Toowoomba, 1938]]\n\n=== The Royal Academy of Dance method (RAD) ===\nThe [[Royal Academy of Dance|Royal Academy of Dance method]], also referred to as the English style of ballet, was established in 1920 by Genee, Karsavina, Bedells, E Espinosa, and Richardson. The goal of this method is to promote academic training in classical ballet throughout Great Britain. This style also spread to the United States, and is widely utilized still today. There are specific grade levels which a student must move through in order to complete training in this method.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dancevillage.com/en/dance-methods/royal-academy-dance.php|title=Ballet Training Techniques - The Royal Academy of Dance (RAD) - DANCE VILLAGE - dance portal and online community|website=www.dancevillage.com|language=en|access-date=2017-07-26|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160227063431/http://www.dancevillage.com/en/dance-methods/royal-academy-dance.php|archivedate=2016-02-27}}</ref> The key principle behind this method of instruction is that basic ballet technique must be taught at a slow pace, with difficulty progression often much slower than the rest of the methods. The idea behind this is if a student is to put in a large amount of effort into perfecting the basic steps, the technique learned in these steps allow a student to utilize harder ones at a much easier rate.<ref name=\":2\"/>\n\n=== Balanchine method ===\n[[File:Suzanne Farrell and George Balanchine NYWTS.jpg|left|thumb|[[Suzanne Farrell]] and [[George Balanchine]] dancing in a segment of \"Don Quixote\" at New York State Theater]]\nDeveloped by [[George Balanchine]] at the [[New York City Ballet]]. His method draws heavily on his own training as a dancer in Russia. The technique is known for extreme speed throughout routines, emphasis on lines, and deep pli\u00e9s. Perhaps one of the most well known differences of this style is the unorthodox positioning of the body.<ref name=\":2\"/> Dancers of this style often have flexed hands and even feet, and are placed in off-balance positions. Important ballet studios teaching this method are the [[Miami City Ballet]], Ballet Chicago Studio company, and the [[School of American Ballet]] in New York.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://dancelessons.net/dancehistory/HistoryofBalletDance.html|title=History of Ballet Dance - Dance History Articles|website=dancelessons.net|access-date=2017-07-26|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170222002745/http://dancelessons.net/dancehistory/HistoryofBalletDance.html|archivedate=2017-02-22}}</ref>\n\n== Costumes ==\n[[File:Anna Pavlova 1912.jpg|alt=Prima Ballerina, Anna Pavlova|thumb|upright|Anna Pavlova (prima ballerina); Early materials for ballet costumes were heavy, hindering the dancer's movements]]\nBallet costumes play an important role in the ballet community. They are often the only survival of a production, representing a living imaginary picture of the scene.<ref name=\"tutuetoile.com\">{{Cite news|url=http://www.tutuetoile.com/ballet-costume-history/|title=Ballet Costume History - Tutu \u00c9toile|newspaper=[[Tutu \u00c9toile]]|language=en-US|access-date=2016-11-18|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161114160803/http://www.tutuetoile.com/ballet-costume-history/|archivedate=2016-11-14}}</ref>\n\n=== Renaissance and Baroque ===\nThe roots of ballet go back to the Renaissance in France and Italy when court wear was the beginning of ballet costumes. Ballet costumes have been around since the early fifteenth century. Cotton and silk were mixed with flax, woven into semitransparent gauze<ref name=\"tutuetoile.com\"/> to create exquisite ballet costumes.\n\n=== Seventeenth century ===\nDuring the seventeenth century, different types of fabrics and designs were used to make costumes more spectacular and eye catching. Court dress still remained for women during this century. Silks, satins and fabrics embroidered with real gold and precious stones increased the level of spectacular decoration associated with ballet costumes.<ref name=\"tutuetoile.com\"/> Women's costumes also consisted of heavy garments and knee-long skirts which made it difficult for them to create much movement and gesture.\n\n=== Eighteenth century ===\nDuring the eighteenth century, stage costumes were still very similar to court wear but progressed over time, mostly due to the French dancer and ballet-master [[Jean-Georges Noverre]] (1727\u20131810) whose proposals to modernize ballet are contained in his revolutionary ''Lettres sur la danse et les ballets'' (1760). Noverre's book altered the emphasis in a production away from the costumes towards the physical movements and emotions of the dancers.\n\nEuropean ballet was centered in the [[Paris Opera]].<ref name=\"tutuetoile.com\"/> During this era, skirts were raised a few inches off the ground.  Flowers, flounces, ribbons, and lace emphasized this opulent feminine style, as soft pastel tones in citron, peach, pink and pistachio dominated the color range.<ref name=\"tutuetoile.com\"/>\n\n=== Nineteenth century ===\n[[File:Olga Spessiva in Swan Lake costume, 1934 photographer Sydney Fox Studio, 3rd Floor, 88 King St, Sydney.jpg|thumb|upright|Olga Spessiva; Swan Lake Costume in the twentieth century]]\nDuring the early nineteenth century, close-fitting body costumes, floral crowns, corsages and jewels were used. Ideals of Romanticism were reflected through female movements.<ref name=\"tutuetoile.com\"/>\n\nCostumes became much tighter as corsets started to come into use, to show off the curves on a ballerina. Jewels and bedazzled costumes became much more popular.\n\n=== Twentieth century ===\nDuring the twentieth century, ballet costumes transitioned back to the influence of Russian ballet. Ballerina skirts became knee-length tutus, later on in order to show off their precise pointe work. Colors used on stage costumes also became much more vibrant. Designers used colors such as red, orange, yellow, etc. to create visual expression when ballet dancers perform on stage.\n\n==Ballet as a career==\nProfessional dancers are generally not well paid.  As of 2017, American dancers (including ballet and other dance forms) were paid an average of US$14.25 per hour.<ref name=\":1\">{{cite web|url=https://www.bls.gov/ooh/entertainment-and-sports/dancers-and-choreographers.htm|title=Dancers and Choreographers: Occupational Outlook Handbook|date=13 April 2018|publisher=[[U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics]]|language=en-us|access-date=2018-11-05|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181105170620/https://www.bls.gov/ooh/entertainment-and-sports/dancers-and-choreographers.htm|archive-date=5 November 2018|url-status=live}}</ref> The job outlook is not strong, and the competition to get a job is intense, with the number of applicants vastly exceeding the number of job openings.<ref name=\":1\" /> Some dancers earn money by participating in dancing competitions and are awarded with money or high paying contracts.<ref name=\":1\" /> [[Choreography|Choreographer]]s were paid nearly twice the amount of dancers in 2017.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n== Health effects ==\nTeenage girl ballet dancers are prone to [[stress fracture]]s in the [[first rib]].<ref>{{Citation|last=Kiel|first=John|title=Stress Reaction and Fractures|date=2018|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK507835/|work=StatPearls|publisher=StatPearls Publishing|pmid=29939612|access-date=2018-11-05|last2=Kaiser|first2=Kimberly}}</ref> [[Eating disorder]]s are a common stereotype associated with ballet.
