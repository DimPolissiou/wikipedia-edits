Project duo consisting of Kusumi Koharu from Morning Musume and Hagiwara Mai from \u2103-ute. The unit was made for the anime Kirarin\u2606Revolution, as both girls lend voices to characters in the series. In the anime itself, both characters had formed Kira\u2606Pika but quickly disbanded. For this reason, the real life counterpart of Kira\u2606Pika haven't released anything else. They released their debut and only single on August 1, 2007, and eventually disbanded in May 2009 after the end of the anime.\n\n{{Authority control}}\n[[Category:Anime musical groups]]\n[[Category:Fictional musical groups]]\n[[Category:Hello!

The language of the charter reflects several important phonological changes that have occurred in [[Bosnian language|Bosnian]] until the 12th century:<ref>D\u017eeneta Jukan (2009), ''Jezik Povelje Kulina bana'', Diplomski rad, p. 13</ref>\n* loss of Common Slavic nasal vowels /\u0119/ > /e/ and /\u01eb/ > /u/\n* loss of weak ''jers'' (occurred during the 10th century; ceased to be spoken in the 11th century). Scribal tradition preserved them word-finally but they were not actually uttered.\n* The vowel ''yeri'' /y/ never occurs word-initially, and turns to /u/ after /k, g, x/. In the 12th century it has a very limited usage, and starts being replaced with the vowel /i/, a change also attested in [[Humac tablet]].\n* change of word-initial cluster v\u044c- to /u/\n\n==History==\nThe first to bring the charter to the public eye was Serbian \u00e9migr\u00e9e [[Jeremija Gagi\u0107]] (1783\u20131859), the former [[Russian Empire|Russian]] consul in Dubrovnik, who claimed to have saved the document in 1817. It was later known that the document was held in the [[Dubrovnik Archive]] until at least 1832, when it was copied by [[\u0110or\u0111e Nikolajevi\u0107]] and published in ''[[Monumenta Serbica]]''. Nikolajevi\u0107 was entrusted with copying Cyrillic manuscripts from the Dubrovnik Archive (in the [[Kingdom of Dalmatia]]) in 1832 for scholarly publication, at which time he stole the manuscripts, along with other manuscripts such as the 1249 charter of Bosnian Ban [[Matej Ninoslav]], the 1254 charter of Serbian King [[Stefan Uro\u0161 I]] and ''\u017eupan'' Radoslav, the 1265 letters of Stefan Uro\u0161 I and the 1385 letters of [[King Tvrtko I]]. Jeremija Gagi\u0107 obtained the charter that Nikolajevi\u0107 stole, and sold or donated it to the Academy of Sciences in [[Saint Petersburg]], where it is held today.<ref>{{harvcoltxt|Vrana|1966|pp=5\u20136}}</ref> Dubrovnik Archive preserves another two copies of the charter.\n\n==Analysis==\n [[File:Povelja bana Kulina.gif|thumb|right|Cyrillic transcript of \"the original\" manuscript (copy A).]]\nThe Saint Petersburg copy is in the literature usually called \"the original\" (or copy ''A''), and copies stored in the Dubrovnik Archive as \"younger copy\" (or copy ''B'') and \"older copy\" (or copy ''C''). At first it was thought that the Saint Petersburg copy, which was the first one to be published and studied, was the original and others were much younger copies (for example, [[Milan Re\u0161etar]] dated the copies B and C into the latter half of the 13th century) but that was called into question by later analyses. According to a study by [[Josip Vrana]], evidence that copy A represents the original remains inconclusive at best, and according to a comparative analysis that copy represents only a conceptual draft of the charter according to which the real original was written. Copies B and C are independent copies of the real original, which was different from the copy A.<ref>{{harvcoltxt|Vrana|1966|pp=46, 56}}</ref>\n\nPalaeographic analysis indicates that all three copies of the charter were written in approximately the same period at the turn of the 12th century, and that their scribes originate from the same milieu, representing the same scribal tradition. Their handwriting on one hand relates to the contemporary Cyrillic monuments, and on the other hand it reflects an influence of the Western, Latin culture.

The language of the charter reflects several important phonological changes that have occurred in [[Bosnian language|Bosnian]] until the 12th century:<ref>D\u017eeneta Jukan (2009), ''Jezik Povelje Kulina bana'', Diplomski rad, p. 13</ref>\n* loss of Common Slavic nasal vowels /\u0119/ > /e/ and /\u01eb/ > /u/\n* loss of weak ''jers'' (occurred during the 10th century; ceased to be spoken in the 11th century). Scribal tradition preserved them word-finally but they were not actually uttered.\n* The vowel ''yeri'' /y/ never occurs word-initially, and turns to /u/ after /k, g, x/. In the 12th century it has a very limited usage, and starts being replaced with the vowel /i/, a change also attested in [[Humac tablet]].\n* change of word-initial cluster v\u044c- to /u/\n\n==History==\nThe first to bring the charter to the public eye was Serbian \u00e9migr\u00e9e [[Jeremija Gagi\u0107]] (1783\u20131859), the former [[Russian Empire|Russian]] consul in Dubrovnik, who claimed to have saved the document in 1817. It was later known that the document was held in the [[Dubrovnik Archive]] until at least 1832, when it was copied by [[\u0110or\u0111e Nikolajevi\u0107]] and published in ''[[Monumenta Serbica]]''. Nikolajevi\u0107 was entrusted with copying Cyrillic manuscripts from the Dubrovnik Archive (in the [[Kingdom of Dalmatia]]) in 1832 for scholarly publication, at which time he stole the manuscripts, along with other manuscripts such as the 1249 charter of Bosnian Ban [[Matej Ninoslav]], the 1254 charter of Serbian King [[Stefan Uro\u0161 I]] and ''\u017eupan'' Radoslav, the 1265 letters of Stefan Uro\u0161 I and the 1385 letters of [[King Tvrtko I]]. Jeremija Gagi\u0107 obtained the charter that Nikolajevi\u0107 stole, and sold or donated it to the Academy of Sciences in [[Saint Petersburg]], where it is held today.<ref>{{harvcoltxt|Vrana|1966|pp=5\u20136}}</ref> Dubrovnik Archive preserves another two copies of the charter.\n\n==Analysis==\n [[File:Povelja bana Kulina.gif|thumb|right|Cyrillic transcript of \"the original\" manuscript (copy A).]]\nThe Saint Petersburg copy is in the literature usually called \"the original\" (or copy ''A''), and copies stored in the Dubrovnik Archive as \"younger copy\" (or copy ''B'') and \"older copy\" (or copy ''C''). At first it was thought that the Saint Petersburg copy, which was the first one to be published and studied, was the original and others were much younger copies (for example, [[Milan Re\u0161etar]] dated the copies B and C into the latter half of the 13th century) but that was called into question by later analyses. According to a study by [[Josip Vrana]], evidence that copy A represents the original remains inconclusive at best, and according to a comparative analysis that copy represents only a conceptual draft of the charter according to which the real original was written. Copies B and C are independent copies of the real original, which was different from the copy A.<ref>{{harvcoltxt|Vrana|1966|pp=46, 56}}</ref>\n\nPalaeographic analysis indicates that all three copies of the charter were written in approximately the same period at the turn of the 12th century, and that their scribes originate from the same milieu, representing the same scribal tradition. Their handwriting on one hand relates to the contemporary Cyrillic monuments, and on the other hand it reflects an influence of the Western, Latin culture. Such cultural and literary opportunities have existed in the [[Travunia]]\u2013[[Zeta (crown land)|Zeta]] area which encompassed the Dubrovnik region at the period.<ref name=\"Vrana 1966 54\">{{harvcoltxt|Vrana|1966|pp=54}}</ref> Copy A probably, and copies B and C with certainty, originate from the scribe who lived and was educated in Dubrovnik and its surroundings.<ref>{{harvcoltxt|Vrana|1966|pp=46}}</ref>\n\nLinguistic analysis however does not point to any specific characteristics of the Dubrovnikan speech, but it does show that the language of the charter has common traits with Ragusan documents from the first half of the 13th century, or those in which Ragusan scribal offices participated.<ref name=\"Vrana 1966 53\">{{harvcoltxt|Vrana|1966|pp=53}}</ref> Given that Ragusan delegates participated in the drafting of their copy, everything points that a scribe from Dubrovnik area must have participated in the formulation of the text of the copy A.<ref name=\"Vrana 1966 53\"/> However, that the final text was written at the court of Ban Kulin is proved by how the date was written: using ''od\u044c ro\u017e\u044cstva xristova'', and not the typical first-half-of-the-13th-century Dubrovnikan ''l\u011bto upl\u044c\u0161teni\u011b''.<ref name=\"Vrana 1966 54\"/>\n\n==Legacy==\nIt is regarded part of Bosnian, Serbian<ref>{{cite book|title=Serbian Studies|volume=4-5|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RnVpAAAAMAAJ|year=1986|publisher=NASSS|p=65}}</ref> and Croatian<ref>{{cite book|title=Journal of Croatian Studies|volume=30|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cfyPAAAAIAAJ|year=1989|publisher=Croatian Academy of America|p=121}}</ref> literature.

Her life in Charleston was greatly affected by the era of Reconstruction, as well as power relations during the time.<ref name=\"Charron\" /> Charleston was strictly segregated and harshly divided by class.<ref name=\"dc.lib.unc.edu\">{{cite web|title=Southern Oral History Program Interview with Septima Clark|url=http://dc.lib.unc.edu/cdm/ref/collection/sohp/id/11139}}</ref> Her father, Peter Poinsette, was enslaved at birth on the [[Joel Roberts Poinsett|Joel Poinsett]] farm between the Waccamaw River and Georgetown. Joel Roberts Poinsett was a distinguished US politician of his time and the namesake of the Poinsettia plant.<ref name=\"Charron\" /> Peter was a house servant to Joel and his main task was taking the children to and from school each day. After slavery, Peter found a job working on a ship in the Charleston harbor. During one of his travels, he went to Haiti and it was then that Peter met Victoria, Clark's mother. The couple got married in Jacksonville, Florida and then moved back to Charleston.<ref name=\"dc.lib.unc.edu\"/>\n\nHer mother, Victoria Warren Anderson Poinsette, was born in Charleston but raised in [[Haiti]] by her brother, who took her and her two sisters there in 1864. Victoria Poinsette had never been enslaved, and vowed to never be anyone's servant.<ref name=\"dc.lib.unc.edu\"/> She returned to Charleston after the Civil War and worked as a launderer. She raised her children very strictly, only permitting them to play with other children on one day of the week. She was also determined to make her daughters into ladies, so she told them never to go out without gloves on, never yell, never eat on the street, etc.<ref name=\"dc.lib.unc.edu\"/> Victoria Warren Anderson Poinsette lived in a constant struggle of wanting to improve her social class; she wanted to live in a middle-class society but on a working-class budget. Victoria made it plain to Peter that he was not providing enough for her and their family.<ref name=\"dc.lib.unc.edu\"/> Victoria raised her children separated, with the boys having more lenient rules than the girls. The boys could have friends over and play many days of the week, but the girls had to do chores and lessons, every day other than Friday. Clark rebelled against her mother's strictness through never becoming the lady she wished her to be and marrying a man Victoria called a \"stranger\".<ref name=\"dc.lib.unc.edu\"/> Clark remembers only ever being punished by her father when she did not want to attend school; however, Clark's father was not able to write his own name until the later years of his life.<ref name=\"Charron\">{{cite book | author = Charron, Katherine Mellen | title = Freedom's Teacher: The Life of Septima Clark| year = 2009 | publisher = The University of North Carolina Press }}</ref>\n\nClark's first educational experience was in 1904 at age six, when she started attending Mary Street School. All Clark did at this school was sit on a set of bleachers with a hundred other six-year-olds, learning nothing. Clark's mother quickly removed her from the school. An elderly woman across the street from their house was teaching girls, so Clark learned to read and write there. Due to Clark's poor financial status, she watched the woman's children every morning and afternoon in return for her tuition. At this time there was not a high school in Charleston for blacks, however, in 1914 a school opened for blacks in 6th, 7th, 8th grade. After sixth grade, she took a test and went on to ninth grade at the [[Avery Research Center for African American History and Culture|Avery Institute]].  All of the teachers were white women, whom Clark admired. In 1914, black teachers were hired and this brought much controversy to the city, which Clark later took part in through the NAACP.<ref name=\"dc.lib.unc.edu\"/>\n\nClark graduated from [[high school]] in 1916. Due to financial constraints, she was not able to attend college initially, so she took a state examination and began working as a school teacher on John's Island at the age of eighteen. She taught on the islands from 1916 to 1919 at Promise Land School and then returned to Avery from 1919 to 1920.<ref name=\"dc.lib.unc.edu\" /> She was able to return to school part-time in Columbia, South Carolina to complete her B.A. at Benedict in 1942 and then she received her M.A. from Hampton.<ref name=\"dc.lib.unc.edu\"/> As an African American, she was barred from teaching in the Charleston, South Carolina public schools, but was able to find a position teaching in a rural school district, on [[John's Island]], the largest of the [[Sea Islands]]. During this time, she taught children during the day and illiterate adults on her own time at night. During this period she developed innovative methods to rapidly teach adults to read and write, based on everyday materials like the Sears catalog.<ref name=\"Olson\" />\n\nClark recalls the gross discrepancies that existed between her school and the white school across the street. Clark's school had 132 students and only one other teacher.<ref>Crawford, Vicki L. ''Women in the Civil Rights Movement: Trailblazers and Torchbearers'', 1941-1965, Indiana University Press (1993), p. 96, {{ISBN|0-253-20832-7}}.</ref> As the teaching principal, Clark made $35 per week, while the other teacher made $25. Meanwhile, the white school across the street had only three students, and the teacher who worked there received $85 per week. It was her first-hand experience with these inequalities that led Clark to become an active proponent for pay equalization for teachers. In 1919 her pay equalization work brought her into the movement for civil rights.<ref>Crawford, Vicki L. ''Women in the Civil Rights Movement: Trailblazers and Torchbearers'' (1993), p. 96.</ref> In an interview with [[Robert Penn Warren]] for the book ''[[Who Speaks for the Negro?]]'', Clark explains how these experiences with her education, as well as her early experiences with growing up in a racist Charleston and teaching in the slums, prompted her to want to work towards civil rights.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Robert Penn Warren Center for the Humanities|title=Septima Poinsette Clark|url=http://whospeaks.library.vanderbilt.edu/interview/septima-poinsette-clark|website=Robert Penn Warren's \"Who Speaks for the Negro\" Archive|accessdate=19 November 2014}}</ref>\n\n===NAACP involvement===\nClark first heard of the NAACP while she was teaching on John's Island from 1916 to 1919. There was no NAACP chapter on John's Island, but a meeting was held in which various preachers came and spoke about what the NAACP was and what exactly it was trying to do. The superintendent was in attendance to collect dues and it was then that she decided to join the organization.<ref>{{cite web|title=Southern History Oral Program Interview with Septima Clark|url=http://dc.lib.unc.edu/cdm/ref/collection/sohp/id/11139}}</ref> \nIn 1919, Clark returned to Charleston to teach sixth grade at Avery Normal Institute, a private academy for black children. In Charleston, she joined the Charleston Branch of the NAACP and began attending meetings regularly of the [[National Association for the Advancement of Colored People]] (NAACP).<ref name=\"Olson\" /><ref name=\"Charron\" /> Under the guidance of Edmund Austin, the President of the local NAACP in Charleston, Clark took part in her first political action with the NAACP in Charleston. Despite the orders of her principal, Clark led her students around the city, going door-to-door, asking for signatures on a petition to allow black principals at Avery. She got 10,000 signatures in a day, and in 1920 black teachers were permitted.<ref name=\"dc.lib.unc.edu\"/> In 1920, Clark enjoyed the first of many legal victories when blacks were given the right to become principals in Charleston's public schools, under the education board of aldermen of Charleston.  Her participation in the NAACP was Clark's first statement in political action.<ref name=\"Charron\" /> In 1945, Clark worked with Thurgood Marshall on a case that was about equal pay for white and black teachers led by NAACP in Columbia, South Carolina.<ref>[http://www.biography.com/people/septima-poinsette-clark-38174#synopsis \"Septima Poinsette Clark\"]. Biography.com.</ref>\n\nThe late-1940s proved to be a difficult time for Clark as she stood up for the NAACP's aim of equalization to integration against many other members and activists.<ref name=\"Charron\" />\n\n===Marriage and children===\nWhile teaching at Avery from 1919 to 1920, Clark met Nerie David Clark. He worked as a warden cook on a submarine in the navy during World War I. In late 1920, she went to teach in McClellanville until 1922. She and Nerie wrote letters back and forth and dated for approximately three years and got married in 1923. They got married in McClellanville and then shortly moved to Hickory, North Carolina, Nerie's hometown. Clark's mother was disgraced by her marriage. Victoria believed that to marry any man outside of the state is to marry a stranger. She refused to have her in-laws for dinner or for any occasion. The marriage severed Victoria and Septima's relationship. While living in Hickory with Nerie's family, Clark became aware of the many cultural and ideal differences they had. They grew up in different worlds; a mountain man and a low-country girl. In Hickory, Clark attended the church Nerie's family did, which was an African Methodist church. She found this church to be much more of a community than her church in Charleston, the United Methodist Church. Throughout Clark's religious journey in life, she found there are many ways to serve God, rather than only one correct way. Clark got homesick, so they moved back to Charleston, where she taught at Promise Land again from 1926 to 1929. In Charleston, they had their first child, which died. Clark viewed the death of her baby as a punishment to her because she married a man not from South Carolina. Her mother was not sympathetic and refused to help her; however, her father was friendlier towards her. To get over her lost baby, she took a job with a white woman for a summer. They stayed in the mountains for the summer and the woman was helpless, which gave Clark optimism and hope. She then moved to Columbia and began teaching in 1929. It was in Columbia she got much more involved in civic activities.<ref name=\"dc.lib.unc.edu\"/>\n\nShe settled in Columbia, South Carolina in 1929, and accepted a teaching position that year. In total, Septima Clark spent a total of 17 years in Columbia, South Carolina. Much of her work there is documented by the University of South Carolina History Department which, under the direction of B. J. Donaldson, has conducted extensive research on African-American education, with special emphasis on the history of the Booker T. Washington High School. In 1929, Septima Clark was employed at Booker T. Washington where she is still remembered as an outstanding educator.  She worked closely with the principals of Booker T. Washington High School, both C. A. Johnson who recruited her for the teaching position she would hold for 17 years and later with J. Andrew Simmons, who was originally from Charleston and whom she may have known previous to their working together in Columbia.  While in Columbia, Septima Clark completed the foundations upon which her career, reputation, and memory would rest:  she became a highly valued faculty member at Booker T. Washington High School, she completed her bachelor's degree at Columbia's Benedict College, and she completed her graduate studies at New York's Columbia University and Atlanta's Clark College.  The level and quality of the education that Septima Clark achieved was typical of what was required by the administrators of the Booker T. Washington High School of Columbia who recruited highly trained teachers from all over the country.  After J. Andrew Simmons left Booker T. Washington High School to take a position in New York in 1945, Septima Clark stayed on for two additional years, before finally leaving Booker T. Washington High School, an institution she had helped to mold, in order to return to Charleston, SC, to take care of her ailing mother, Victoria.\n\nDuring this time, Clark had trouble providing for Nerie, Jr. In 1935, she decided to send him back to Hickory to live with his paternal grandparents.<ref name=\"Olson\" />  Clark's decision to send Nerie, Jr. to live with his paternal grandparents was a common action at this time due to the Great Depression and its resulting financial issues.<ref name=\"Charron\" />  Septima Poinsette Clark's marriage to Nerie David Clark resulted in a course of depression for Clark, as well as a significant decline in her self-confidence.<ref name=\"Charron\" />\n\n===Columbia University and NAACP leadership===\nDuring summers, Clark began studies at [[Columbia University]] in New York, and at [[Clark Atlanta University|Atlanta University]] in Georgia with the landmark figure in the racial equality movement, [[W. E. B. Du Bois]].<ref>Collier-Thomas, Bettye. ''Sisters in the Struggle: African American Women in the Civil Rights-Black'', NYU Press (2001), p. 101, {{ISBN|0-8147-1603-2}}.</ref> Between 1942 and 1945, she received a bachelor's degree from [[Benedict College]], Columbia, SC <ref>[https://kinginstitute.stanford.edu/encyclopedia/clark-septima-poinsette \"Clark, Septima Poinsette (1898-1987)\"], Encyclopedia, The King Center.</ref> and a master's degree from Hampton (Virginia) Institute (now [[Hampton University]]). While earning her B.A., she was taking classes in the morning, teaching from noon to five in the afternoons, and taking more classes in the evenings. She was earning $62.50 per month in college and every summer she traveled to Maine to earn more money. The NAACP in Columbia, SC, had approximately 800 members and all were black. The biggest NAACP impact during Clark's time in Columbia was they sponsored a suit that won the equalization of teacher salaries. It was a huge win for the NAACP.<ref name=\"dc.lib.unc.edu\"/>  In 1947, Clark returned to Charleston to take care of her mother who had had a stroke. While caring for her mother Clark's role as an educator and activist did not subside. During this time, she taught in the Charleston public schools, she was active with the [[YWCA]], and served as membership chairperson of the Charleston NAACP. The YWCA was one of the few organizations in Charleston that was interracial. There were black and white branches.<ref>{{cite web|title=Southern Oral History Program Interview with Spetima Clark|url=http://dc.lib.unc.edu/cdm/ref/collection/sohp/id/11139}}</ref>  In 1956, Clark obtained the position of vice president of the Charleston NAACP branch.\n\nThat same year, the South Carolina legislature passed a law banning city or state employees from being involved with civil rights organizations. Clark believed that a combination of relations, such as social and power relations, were a major contributor to schooling.<ref name=\"Brown-Nagin\" />  Clark was upfront in her refusal to leave the NAACP, and was thus fired from her job by the Charleston City School Board, losing her pension after 40 years employment.<ref name=\"Charron\" /> She soon found that no school in Charleston would hire her. A black teachers' sorority held a fundraiser for her benefit, but no member would have their picture taken with her, fearing that they would lose their own jobs.<ref name=\"Olson\" />\n\n===Highlander Folk School literacy courses===\nAround this time, Clark was active with the [[Highlander Folk School]] in Monteagle, [[Tennessee]]. She first attended a workshop there in 1954. [[Myles Horton]], the founder of Highlander, quickly hired her as the full-time director of workshops.<ref name=\"Robnett 1997\">{{cite book|last=Robnett|first=Belinda|title=How Long? How Long?|year=1997|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=New York}}</ref>  Before long she was teaching literacy courses, drawing on her experience on John's Island. \"In a compressed week's workshop, Clark promised to turn sharecroppers and other unschooled Negros into potential voters\".<ref name=\"Branch1\">{{cite book | author = Branch, Taylor | title = Parting the Waters: America in the King Years 1954\u201363 | url = https://archive.org/details/partingwatersame00bran_0 | url-access = registration | year = 1989 | publisher = Simon & Schuster }}</ref>\n\nHighlander was one of the few interracial schools in the South at the time and Clark prospered as a teacher there. After being fired and unwelcomed in her hometown, Clark found Highlander to be a great community.\nIn 1959, while she was teaching at Highlander she was arrested for allegedly \"possessing whiskey\"; however, these charges were later dropped and seen as false.<ref name=\"Robnett 1997\"/>\n\nClark and her cousin, [[Bernice Robinson]], expanded and spread the program. They taught students how to fill out driver's license exams, voter registration forms, Sears mail-order forms, and how to sign checks. Clark also served as Highlander's director of workshops, recruiting teachers and students.<ref name=\"Origins\">{{cite book | author = Morris, Aldon D. | title = The Origins of the Civil Rights Movement | year = 1984 | publisher = The Free Press }}</ref> One of the participants in her workshops was [[Rosa Parks]]. A few months after participating in the workshops Parks helped to start the [[Montgomery Bus Boycott]]. Many other women who took part in the Montgomery Bus Boycott also attended Highlander and participated in Clark's workshops. Upon seeing the success of Clark, [[Ella Baker]] traveled to Highlander as a representative of SCLC and observed to see if Clark's program could be incorporated into SCLC's [[Crusade for Citizenship]].<ref name=\"Robnett 1997\"/>\n\n===The spread of Citizenship Schools===\nClark is most famous for establishing \"Citizenship Schools\" teaching reading to adults throughout the Deep South, in hopes of carrying on a tradition.<ref name=\"Charron\" />  The creation of citizenship schools developed from Septima Clark's teaching of adult literacy courses throughout the interwar years.<ref name=\"Charron\" /> While the project served to increase literacy, it also served as a means to empower Black communities. Her teaching approach was very specific in making sure her students felt invested in what they were learning, so she connected the politics of the movement to the needs of the people. She was not only teaching literacy, but also citizenship rights. Clark's goals for the schools were to provide self-pride, cultural-pride, literacy, and a sense of one's citizenship rights. She was recruiting the rural communities to get involved with the movement.<ref name=\"Robnett 1997\"/> Citizenship schools were frequently taught in the back room of a shop so as to elude the violence of racist whites.  The teachers of citizenship schools were often people who had learned to read as adults as well, as one of the primary goals of the citizenship schools was to develop more local leaders for people's movements.  Teaching people how to read helped countless Black Southerners push for the right to vote, but beyond that, it also developed leaders across the country who would help push the civil rights movement long after 1964.  The citizenship schools are just one example of the empowerment strategy for developing leaders that was core to the civil rights movement in the South<ref name=\"Payne, Charles 1997\">Payne, Charles. ''I've Got the Light of Freedom:  The Organizing Tradition and the Mississippi Freedom Struggle.'' University of California, 1997.</ref> The citizenship schools are also seen as a form of support to [[Martin Luther King, Jr.]] in the nonviolent Civil Rights Movement.<ref name=\"Charron\" />\n\nThe project was a response to legislation in Southern states which required literacy and interpreting various portions of the [[US Constitution]] in order to be allowed to register to vote. These laws were used to disenfranchise black citizens. Citizenship Schools were based on the adult literacy programs Clark and Robinson had developed at Highlander. They required a week's worth of training in a program that was ultimately designed by Clark.<ref name=\"Charron\" />  Septima Clark hired her cousin [[Bernice Robinson]], to be the first teacher. Bernice was also a Highlander alumna. In addition to literacy, Citizenship Schools also taught students to act collectively and protest against racism.\n\nThe leadership schools ultimately spread to a number of Southern states, growing so large that, upon the recommendation of [[Myles Horton]] and Clark, the program was transferred to the [[Southern Christian Leadership Conference]] (SCLC), in 1961 though initially Martin Luther King, Jr was hesitant about the idea.<ref name=\"Payne, Charles 1997\"/>  Transferring the program to the SCLC was also a result of financial troubles at Highlander Folk School in Tennessee.<ref name=\"Charron\" /> With the increased budget of the SCLC, the citizenship school project trained over 10,000 citizenship school teachers who led citizenship schools throughout the South, representing a popular education effort on a massive scale<ref name=\"Payne, Charles 1997\"/> On top of these 10,000 teachers, citizenship schools reached out and taught more than 25,000 people.<ref name=\"Charron\" /> By 1958, 37 adults were able to pass the voter registration test as a result of the first session of community schools.<ref name=\"Brown-Nagin\" />  Before 1969, about 700,000 African Americans became registered voters thanks to Clark's dedication to the movement.<ref name=\"Brown-Nagin\" />  Clark came to national prominence, becoming the SCLC's director of education and teaching.  Clark was the first woman to gain a position on the SCLC board.<ref name=\"Brown-Nagin\" />  [[Andrew Young]], who had joined Highlander the previous year to work with the Citizenship Schools, also joined the SCLC staff. The SCLC staff of citizenship schools were mainly women, as a result of the daily experience gained by becoming a teacher.<ref name=\"Charron\" />  Clark would struggle against sexism during her time on the SCLC, as had [[Ella Baker]], with the bulk of sexism emanating from [[Martin Luther King, Jr.]]<ref name=\"Payne, Charles 1997\"/>  [[Ralph Abernathy]] also objected to her, as Clark said, \"I can remember Reverend Abernathy asking many times, why was Septima Clark on the Executive Board of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference? And Dr. King would always say, 'She was the one who proposed this citizenship education which is bringing to us not only money but a lot of people who will register and vote.' And he asked that many times. It was hard for him to see a woman on that executive body.\" <ref>[http://docsouth.unc.edu/sohp/playback.html?base_file=G-0017&duration=01:26:08 \"Interview with Septima Poinsette Clark, July 30, 1976\"].

She was also an active member of [[Alpha Kappa Alpha]] sorority.<ref>McNealey, Earnestine G. ''Pearls of Service: The Legacy of America's First Black Sorority, Alpha Kappa Alpha'', Chicago: Alpha Kappa Alpha Sorority, Incorporated (2006) - {{LCCN|2006928528}}</ref> Clark retired from active work with the SCLC in 1970. She later sought reinstatement of the pension and back salary that had been canceled when she was dismissed as a teacher in 1956, which she won. She was later to serve two terms on the Charleston County School Board.\n\n===Death and legacy===\nIn 1978, Clark was awarded an honorary doctorate of humane letters by the [[College of Charleston]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://ldhi.library.cofc.edu/exhibits/show/septima_clark/local-and-national-leader|title=Local and National Leader: Septima P.

In a eulogy presented at the funeral, the president of the [[Southern Christian Leadership Conference]] (SCLC) described the importance of Clark's work and her relationship to the SCLC.

Washington]] and [[W. E. B. DuBois]].  Washington and Clark both emphasized the importance of self-improvement before the importance of institutional reforms.

Her life in Charleston was greatly affected by the era of Reconstruction, as well as power relations during the time.<ref name=\"Charron\" /> Charleston was strictly segregated and harshly divided by class.<ref name=\"dc.lib.unc.edu\">{{cite web|title=Southern Oral History Program Interview with Septima Clark|url=http://dc.lib.unc.edu/cdm/ref/collection/sohp/id/11139}}</ref> Her father, Peter Poinsette, was enslaved at birth on the [[Joel Roberts Poinsett|Joel Poinsett]] farm between the Waccamaw River and Georgetown. Joel Roberts Poinsett was a distinguished US politician of his time and the namesake of the Poinsettia plant.<ref name=\"Charron\" /> Peter was a house servant to Joel and his main task was taking the children to and from school each day. After slavery, Peter found a job working on a ship in the Charleston harbor. During one of his travels, he went to Haiti and it was then that Peter met Victoria, Clark's mother. The couple got married in Jacksonville, Florida and then moved back to Charleston.<ref name=\"dc.lib.unc.edu\"/>\n\nHer mother, Victoria Warren Anderson Poinsette, was born in Charleston but raised in [[Haiti]] by her brother, who took her and her two sisters there in 1864. Victoria Poinsette had never been enslaved, and vowed to never be anyone's servant.<ref name=\"dc.lib.unc.edu\"/> She returned to Charleston after the Civil War and worked as a launderer. She raised her children very strictly, only permitting them to play with other children on one day of the week. She was also determined to make her daughters into ladies, so she told them never to go out without gloves on, never yell, never eat on the street, etc.<ref name=\"dc.lib.unc.edu\"/> Victoria Warren Anderson Poinsette lived in a constant struggle of wanting to improve her social class; she wanted to live in a middle-class society but on a working-class budget. Victoria made it plain to Peter that he was not providing enough for her and their family.<ref name=\"dc.lib.unc.edu\"/> Victoria raised her children separated, with the boys having more lenient rules than the girls. The boys could have friends over and play many days of the week, but the girls had to do chores and lessons, every day other than Friday. Clark rebelled against her mother's strictness through never becoming the lady she wished her to be and marrying a man Victoria called a \"stranger\".<ref name=\"dc.lib.unc.edu\"/> Clark remembers only ever being punished by her father when she did not want to attend school; however, Clark's father was not able to write his own name until the later years of his life.<ref name=\"Charron\">{{cite book | author = Charron, Katherine Mellen | title = Freedom's Teacher: The Life of Septima Clark| year = 2009 | publisher = The University of North Carolina Press }}</ref>\n\nClark's first educational experience was in 1904 at age six, when she started attending Mary Street School. All Clark did at this school was sit on a set of bleachers with a hundred other six-year-olds, learning nothing. Clark's mother quickly removed her from the school. An elderly woman across the street from their house was teaching girls, so Clark learned to read and write there. Due to Clark's poor financial status, she watched the woman's children every morning and afternoon in return for her tuition. At this time there was not a high school in Charleston for blacks, however, in 1914 a school opened for blacks in 6th, 7th, 8th grade. After sixth grade, she took a test and went on to ninth grade at the [[Avery Research Center for African American History and Culture|Avery Institute]].  All of the teachers were white women, whom Clark admired. In 1914, black teachers were hired and this brought much controversy to the city, which Clark later took part in through the NAACP.<ref name=\"dc.lib.unc.edu\"/>\n\nClark graduated from [[high school]] in 1916. Due to financial constraints, she was not able to attend college initially, so she took a state examination and began working as a school teacher on John's Island at the age of eighteen. She taught on the islands from 1916 to 1919 at Promise Land School and then returned to Avery from 1919 to 1920.<ref name=\"dc.lib.unc.edu\" /> She was able to return to school part-time in Columbia, South Carolina to complete her B.A. at Benedict in 1942 and then she received her M.A. from Hampton.<ref name=\"dc.lib.unc.edu\"/> As an African American, she was barred from teaching in the Charleston, South Carolina public schools, but was able to find a position teaching in a rural school district, on [[John's Island]], the largest of the [[Sea Islands]]. During this time, she taught children during the day and illiterate adults on her own time at night. During this period she developed innovative methods to rapidly teach adults to read and write, based on everyday materials like the Sears catalog.<ref name=\"Olson\" />\n\nClark recalls the gross discrepancies that existed between her school and the white school across the street. Clark's school had 132 students and only one other teacher.<ref>Crawford, Vicki L. ''Women in the Civil Rights Movement: Trailblazers and Torchbearers'', 1941-1965, Indiana University Press (1993), p. 96, {{ISBN|0-253-20832-7}}.</ref> As the teaching principal, Clark made $35 per week, while the other teacher made $25. Meanwhile, the white school across the street had only three students, and the teacher who worked there received $85 per week. It was her first-hand experience with these inequalities that led Clark to become an active proponent for pay equalization for teachers. In 1919 her pay equalization work brought her into the movement for civil rights.<ref>Crawford, Vicki L. ''Women in the Civil Rights Movement: Trailblazers and Torchbearers'' (1993), p. 96.</ref> In an interview with [[Robert Penn Warren]] for the book ''[[Who Speaks for the Negro?]]'', Clark explains how these experiences with her education, as well as her early experiences with growing up in a racist Charleston and teaching in the slums, prompted her to want to work towards civil rights.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Robert Penn Warren Center for the Humanities|title=Septima Poinsette Clark|url=http://whospeaks.library.vanderbilt.edu/interview/septima-poinsette-clark|website=Robert Penn Warren's \"Who Speaks for the Negro\" Archive|accessdate=19 November 2014}}</ref>\n\n===NAACP involvement===\nClark first heard of the NAACP while she was teaching on John's Island from 1916 to 1919. There was no NAACP chapter on John's Island, but a meeting was held in which various preachers came and spoke about what the NAACP was and what exactly it was trying to do. The superintendent was in attendance to collect dues and it was then that she decided to join the organization.<ref>{{cite web|title=Southern History Oral Program Interview with Septima Clark|url=http://dc.lib.unc.edu/cdm/ref/collection/sohp/id/11139}}</ref> \nIn 1919, Clark returned to Charleston to teach sixth grade at Avery Normal Institute, a private academy for black children. In Charleston, she joined the Charleston Branch of the NAACP and began attending meetings regularly of the [[National Association for the Advancement of Colored People]] (NAACP).<ref name=\"Olson\" /><ref name=\"Charron\" /> Under the guidance of Edmund Austin, the President of the local NAACP in Charleston, Clark took part in her first political action with the NAACP in Charleston. Despite the orders of her principal, Clark led her students around the city, going door-to-door, asking for signatures on a petition to allow black principals at Avery. She got 10,000 signatures in a day, and in 1920 black teachers were permitted.<ref name=\"dc.lib.unc.edu\"/> In 1920, Clark enjoyed the first of many legal victories when blacks were given the right to become principals in Charleston's public schools, under the education board of aldermen of Charleston.  Her participation in the NAACP was Clark's first statement in political action.<ref name=\"Charron\" /> In 1945, Clark worked with Thurgood Marshall on a case that was about equal pay for white and black teachers led by NAACP in Columbia, South Carolina.<ref>[http://www.biography.com/people/septima-poinsette-clark-38174#synopsis \"Septima Poinsette Clark\"]. Biography.com.</ref>\n\nThe late-1940s proved to be a difficult time for Clark as she stood up for the NAACP's aim of equalization to integration against many other members and activists.<ref name=\"Charron\" />\n\n===Marriage and children===\nWhile teaching at Avery from 1919 to 1920, Clark met Nerie David Clark. He worked as a warden cook on a submarine in the navy during World War I. In late 1920, she went to teach in McClellanville until 1922. She and Nerie wrote letters back and forth and dated for approximately three years and got married in 1923. They got married in McClellanville and then shortly moved to Hickory, North Carolina, Nerie's hometown. Clark's mother was disgraced by her marriage. Victoria believed that to marry any man outside of the state is to marry a stranger. She refused to have her in-laws for dinner or for any occasion. The marriage severed Victoria and Septima's relationship. While living in Hickory with Nerie's family, Clark became aware of the many cultural and ideal differences they had. They grew up in different worlds; a mountain man and a low-country girl. In Hickory, Clark attended the church Nerie's family did, which was an African Methodist church. She found this church to be much more of a community than her church in Charleston, the United Methodist Church. Throughout Clark's religious journey in life, she found there are many ways to serve God, rather than only one correct way. Clark got homesick, so they moved back to Charleston, where she taught at Promise Land again from 1926 to 1929. In Charleston, they had their first child, which died. Clark viewed the death of her baby as a punishment to her because she married a man not from South Carolina. Her mother was not sympathetic and refused to help her; however, her father was friendlier towards her. To get over her lost baby, she took a job with a white woman for a summer. They stayed in the mountains for the summer and the woman was helpless, which gave Clark optimism and hope. She then moved to Columbia and began teaching in 1929. It was in Columbia she got much more involved in civic activities.<ref name=\"dc.lib.unc.edu\"/>\n\nShe settled in Columbia, South Carolina in 1929, and accepted a teaching position that year. In total, Septima Clark spent a total of 17 years in Columbia, South Carolina. Much of her work there is documented by the University of South Carolina History Department which, under the direction of B. J. Donaldson, has conducted extensive research on African-American education, with special emphasis on the history of the Booker T. Washington High School. In 1929, Septima Clark was employed at Booker T. Washington where she is still remembered as an outstanding educator.  She worked closely with the principals of Booker T. Washington High School, both C. A. Johnson who recruited her for the teaching position she would hold for 17 years and later with J. Andrew Simmons, who was originally from Charleston and whom she may have known previous to their working together in Columbia.  While in Columbia, Septima Clark completed the foundations upon which her career, reputation, and memory would rest:  she became a highly valued faculty member at Booker T. Washington High School, she completed her bachelor's degree at Columbia's Benedict College, and she completed her graduate studies at New York's Columbia University and Atlanta's Clark College.  The level and quality of the education that Septima Clark achieved was typical of what was required by the administrators of the Booker T. Washington High School of Columbia who recruited highly trained teachers from all over the country.  After J. Andrew Simmons left Booker T. Washington High School to take a position in New York in 1945, Septima Clark stayed on for two additional years, before finally leaving Booker T. Washington High School, an institution she had helped to mold, in order to return to Charleston, SC, to take care of her ailing mother, Victoria.\n\nDuring this time, Clark had trouble providing for Nerie, Jr. In 1935, she decided to send him back to Hickory to live with his paternal grandparents.<ref name=\"Olson\" />  Clark's decision to send Nerie, Jr. to live with his paternal grandparents was a common action at this time due to the Great Depression and its resulting financial issues.<ref name=\"Charron\" />  Septima Poinsette Clark's marriage to Nerie David Clark resulted in a course of depression for Clark, as well as a significant decline in her self-confidence.<ref name=\"Charron\" />\n\n===Columbia University and NAACP leadership===\nDuring summers, Clark began studies at [[Columbia University]] in New York, and at [[Clark Atlanta University|Atlanta University]] in Georgia with the landmark figure in the racial equality movement, [[W. E. B. Du Bois]].<ref>Collier-Thomas, Bettye. ''Sisters in the Struggle: African American Women in the Civil Rights-Black'', NYU Press (2001), p. 101, {{ISBN|0-8147-1603-2}}.</ref> Between 1942 and 1945, she received a bachelor's degree from [[Benedict College]], Columbia, SC <ref>[https://kinginstitute.stanford.edu/encyclopedia/clark-septima-poinsette \"Clark, Septima Poinsette (1898-1987)\"], Encyclopedia, The King Center.</ref> and a master's degree from Hampton (Virginia) Institute (now [[Hampton University]]). While earning her B.A., she was taking classes in the morning, teaching from noon to five in the afternoons, and taking more classes in the evenings. She was earning $62.50 per month in college and every summer she traveled to Maine to earn more money. The NAACP in Columbia, SC, had approximately 800 members and all were black. The biggest NAACP impact during Clark's time in Columbia was they sponsored a suit that won the equalization of teacher salaries. It was a huge win for the NAACP.<ref name=\"dc.lib.unc.edu\"/>  In 1947, Clark returned to Charleston to take care of her mother who had had a stroke. While caring for her mother Clark's role as an educator and activist did not subside. During this time, she taught in the Charleston public schools, she was active with the [[YWCA]], and served as membership chairperson of the Charleston NAACP. The YWCA was one of the few organizations in Charleston that was interracial. There were black and white branches.<ref>{{cite web|title=Southern Oral History Program Interview with Spetima Clark|url=http://dc.lib.unc.edu/cdm/ref/collection/sohp/id/11139}}</ref>  In 1956, Clark obtained the position of vice president of the Charleston NAACP branch.\n\nThat same year, the South Carolina legislature passed a law banning city or state employees from being involved with civil rights organizations. Clark believed that a combination of relations, such as social and power relations, were a major contributor to schooling.<ref name=\"Brown-Nagin\" />  Clark was upfront in her refusal to leave the NAACP, and was thus fired from her job by the Charleston City School Board, losing her pension after 40 years employment.<ref name=\"Charron\" /> She soon found that no school in Charleston would hire her. A black teachers' sorority held a fundraiser for her benefit, but no member would have their picture taken with her, fearing that they would lose their own jobs.<ref name=\"Olson\" />\n\n===Highlander Folk School literacy courses===\nAround this time, Clark was active with the [[Highlander Folk School]] in Monteagle, [[Tennessee]]. She first attended a workshop there in 1954. [[Myles Horton]], the founder of Highlander, quickly hired her as the full-time director of workshops.<ref name=\"Robnett 1997\">{{cite book|last=Robnett|first=Belinda|title=How Long? How Long?|year=1997|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=New York}}</ref>  Before long she was teaching literacy courses, drawing on her experience on John's Island. \"In a compressed week's workshop, Clark promised to turn sharecroppers and other unschooled Negros into potential voters\".<ref name=\"Branch1\">{{cite book | author = Branch, Taylor | title = Parting the Waters: America in the King Years 1954\u201363 | url = https://archive.org/details/partingwatersame00bran_0 | url-access = registration | year = 1989 | publisher = Simon & Schuster }}</ref>\n\nHighlander was one of the few interracial schools in the South at the time and Clark prospered as a teacher there. After being fired and unwelcomed in her hometown, Clark found Highlander to be a great community.\nIn 1959, while she was teaching at Highlander she was arrested for allegedly \"possessing whiskey\"; however, these charges were later dropped and seen as false.<ref name=\"Robnett 1997\"/>\n\nClark and her cousin, [[Bernice Robinson]], expanded and spread the program. They taught students how to fill out driver's license exams, voter registration forms, Sears mail-order forms, and how to sign checks. Clark also served as Highlander's director of workshops, recruiting teachers and students.<ref name=\"Origins\">{{cite book | author = Morris, Aldon D. | title = The Origins of the Civil Rights Movement | year = 1984 | publisher = The Free Press }}</ref> One of the participants in her workshops was [[Rosa Parks]]. A few months after participating in the workshops Parks helped to start the [[Montgomery Bus Boycott]]. Many other women who took part in the Montgomery Bus Boycott also attended Highlander and participated in Clark's workshops. Upon seeing the success of Clark, [[Ella Baker]] traveled to Highlander as a representative of SCLC and observed to see if Clark's program could be incorporated into SCLC's [[Crusade for Citizenship]].<ref name=\"Robnett 1997\"/>\n\n===The spread of Citizenship Schools===\nClark is most famous for establishing \"Citizenship Schools\" teaching reading to adults throughout the Deep South, in hopes of carrying on a tradition.<ref name=\"Charron\" />  The creation of citizenship schools developed from Septima Clark's teaching of adult literacy courses throughout the interwar years.<ref name=\"Charron\" /> While the project served to increase literacy, it also served as a means to empower Black communities. Her teaching approach was very specific in making sure her students felt invested in what they were learning, so she connected the politics of the movement to the needs of the people. She was not only teaching literacy, but also citizenship rights. Clark's goals for the schools were to provide self-pride, cultural-pride, literacy, and a sense of one's citizenship rights. She was recruiting the rural communities to get involved with the movement.<ref name=\"Robnett 1997\"/> Citizenship schools were frequently taught in the back room of a shop so as to elude the violence of racist whites.  The teachers of citizenship schools were often people who had learned to read as adults as well, as one of the primary goals of the citizenship schools was to develop more local leaders for people's movements.  Teaching people how to read helped countless Black Southerners push for the right to vote, but beyond that, it also developed leaders across the country who would help push the civil rights movement long after 1964.  The citizenship schools are just one example of the empowerment strategy for developing leaders that was core to the civil rights movement in the South<ref name=\"Payne, Charles 1997\">Payne, Charles. ''I've Got the Light of Freedom:  The Organizing Tradition and the Mississippi Freedom Struggle.'' University of California, 1997.</ref> The citizenship schools are also seen as a form of support to [[Martin Luther King, Jr.]] in the nonviolent Civil Rights Movement.<ref name=\"Charron\" />\n\nThe project was a response to legislation in Southern states which required literacy and interpreting various portions of the [[US Constitution]] in order to be allowed to register to vote. These laws were used to disenfranchise black citizens. Citizenship Schools were based on the adult literacy programs Clark and Robinson had developed at Highlander. They required a week's worth of training in a program that was ultimately designed by Clark.<ref name=\"Charron\" />  Septima Clark hired her cousin [[Bernice Robinson]], to be the first teacher. Bernice was also a Highlander alumna. In addition to literacy, Citizenship Schools also taught students to act collectively and protest against racism.\n\nThe leadership schools ultimately spread to a number of Southern states, growing so large that, upon the recommendation of [[Myles Horton]] and Clark, the program was transferred to the [[Southern Christian Leadership Conference]] (SCLC), in 1961 though initially Martin Luther King, Jr was hesitant about the idea.<ref name=\"Payne, Charles 1997\"/>  Transferring the program to the SCLC was also a result of financial troubles at Highlander Folk School in Tennessee.<ref name=\"Charron\" /> With the increased budget of the SCLC, the citizenship school project trained over 10,000 citizenship school teachers who led citizenship schools throughout the South, representing a popular education effort on a massive scale<ref name=\"Payne, Charles 1997\"/> On top of these 10,000 teachers, citizenship schools reached out and taught more than 25,000 people.<ref name=\"Charron\" /> By 1958, 37 adults were able to pass the voter registration test as a result of the first session of community schools.<ref name=\"Brown-Nagin\" />  Before 1969, about 700,000 African Americans became registered voters thanks to Clark's dedication to the movement.<ref name=\"Brown-Nagin\" />  Clark came to national prominence, becoming the SCLC's director of education and teaching.  Clark was the first woman to gain a position on the SCLC board.<ref name=\"Brown-Nagin\" />  [[Andrew Young]], who had joined Highlander the previous year to work with the Citizenship Schools, also joined the SCLC staff. The SCLC staff of citizenship schools were mainly women, as a result of the daily experience gained by becoming a teacher.<ref name=\"Charron\" />  Clark would struggle against sexism during her time on the SCLC, as had [[Ella Baker]], with the bulk of sexism emanating from [[Martin Luther King, Jr.]]<ref name=\"Payne, Charles 1997\"/>  [[Ralph Abernathy]] also objected to her, as Clark said, \"I can remember Reverend Abernathy asking many times, why was Septima Clark on the Executive Board of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference? And Dr. King would always say, 'She was the one who proposed this citizenship education which is bringing to us not only money but a lot of people who will register and vote.' And he asked that many times. It was hard for him to see a woman on that executive body.\" <ref>[http://docsouth.unc.edu/sohp/playback.html?base_file=G-0017&duration=01:26:08 \"Interview with Septima Poinsette Clark, July 30, 1976\"].

She was also an active member of [[Alpha Kappa Alpha]] sorority.<ref>McNealey, Earnestine G. ''Pearls of Service: The Legacy of America's First Black Sorority, Alpha Kappa Alpha'', Chicago: Alpha Kappa Alpha Sorority, Incorporated (2006) - {{LCCN|2006928528}}</ref> Clark retired from active work with the SCLC in 1970. She later sought reinstatement of the pension and back salary that had been canceled when she was dismissed as a teacher in 1956, which she won. She was later to serve two terms on the Charleston County School Board.\n\n===Death and legacy===\nIn 1978, Clark was awarded an honorary doctorate of humane letters by the [[College of Charleston]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://ldhi.library.cofc.edu/exhibits/show/septima_clark/local-and-national-leader|title=Local and National Leader: Septima P.

The company has specialised in [[Ford]] vehicles, in which the manufacturer's models are recognised by the brand name ''Perana'' added to the model name. The name Perana is a deliberate misspelling, as ''Piranha'' already had been protected. Currently the company is active as a dealer of Ford and [[Mazda]] vehicles.\n\nFounded in 1967 by [[Basil Green]] the company dealt with [[engine tuning]] of Ford vehicles and participated in a variety of races as racing team. After winning several races the Ford Motor Company became aware of the company and used the company for some of the South African models as a kind of in-house tuner.\n\n==Cortina Mk II==\n{{Infobox automobile\n| name         = Gunston Cortina\n| image        = Gunston Cortina.jpg\n| caption      = Ford Cortina Gunston Perana\n| manufacturer = Basil Green Motors\n| assembly     = South Africa\n| production   = 1967\u20131972\n| 4-door [[sedan (car)|saloon]]\n| designer     =\n}}\nThe first model of the manufacturer was the Ford Cortina Perana V6, which was launched in 1967 as a tuning model. [[Serial production|Production]] began one year later in the summer. ''Grosvenor Motors'', then the largest Ford dealer in South Africa, took over the sales. The price was 2950 [[South African rand|Rand]]. The standard version was based on the [[Ford Cortina]] Mk II GT. For the units ordered by the [[Gunston Cigarette Company]], the Ford Cortina XL was used as basis. The [[Ford Essex V6 engine (UK)|Ford Essex engine]] with 2994 cc was used as engine. This was taken from the [[Ford Zephyr]] as well as the powertrain. After the conversion and lowering the Cortina Perana V6 was 64&nbsp;kg heavier than the Ford standard model. Recognition features of the Cortina Perana V6 are a black strip over the bonnet, a black front grille and black coloured rims.\n<div style=\"clear: both;\"></div>\n\n==Escort Mk I==\n{{Infobox automobile\n| name         = Escort Perana\n| image        = Escort_Perana.jpg\n| caption      = Ford Escort Perana\n| manufacturer = Basil Green Motors\n| assembly     = South Africa\n| production   = 1968 \u2013 ?\n| 2-door [[sedan (car)|saloon]]\n| designer     =\n}}\nThe second model of the manufacturer was 1968 the sports car [[Ford_Escort_(Europe)|Ford Escort]] ''Perana''. Ford wanted to use the RS&nbsp;1600, but the [[Cosworth#The_BDA_series|Cosworth BDA engine]] proved too complex for South Africa. So Basil Green made new plans and fitted the four cylinder engine of the [[Ford Pinto]].\n\nThe removed RS&nbsp;1600 engines Basil Green sold for 695 [[South African rand|Rand]] as ideal for among others the Escort.\n<div style=\"clear: both;\"></div>\n\n==Capri Mk I==\n{{Infobox automobile\n| name         = Capri Perana\n| image        = Capri_Perana_V8.jpg\n| caption      = Ford Capri Perana V8\n| manufacturer = Ford of South Africa\n| assembly     = South Africa\n| production   = 1969\u20131973\n| [[Coup\u00e9]]\n| designer     =\n}}\nThe next model, the ''[[Ford Capri]] Perana'' came out in 1969 as V6 version. About 20 units of this model were built; the top speed was 186 km/h. As Ford offered the Essex engine as standard from 1970 on, Basil Green had to take a more powerful engine. So he replaced the V6 with the [[Ford_Windsor_engine|Windsor]] V8 of the [[Ford Mustang]]. \n\nTechnically the Capri Perana was a mix of the Australian [[Ford Falcon (XW)]] and the American Ford Mustang. It was sold with a 4 speed [[Ford Toploader transmission]] and the 3 speed [[Ford C4 transmission|C4]] [[automatic transmission]]. In the beginning the price for this car was 4,450 Rand. \n\nTop speed was 228 km/h, acceleration from 0 to 100&nbsp;km/h was possible in 6.7 seconds (automatic version 7.0 sec). \n\nOfficially the Capri Perana was only sold in \"Bright Yellow\" and \"Piri Piri Red\", but some cars were painted in different colours, for example Basil Green's Perana naturally was green. \n\nThe cars were manufactured by Ford of South Africa (a subsidiary of the [[Ford Motor Company of Canada]]). Production ended in 1973.\n<div style=\"clear: both;\"></div>\n\n===Racing===\n{{Infobox automobile\n| name         = Gunston Perana\n| image        = Gunston_Perana_2009.jpg\n| caption      = Gunston Perana V8\n| manufacturer = Basil Green Motors\n| assembly     = South Africa\n| production   = 1969 \u2013 ?\n| body_style  =  [[Coup\u00e9]]\n| designer     =\n}}\nBased on the Capri Perana V8 racing cars were build for the [[South African Saloon Car Championship]]. The Z&nbsp;181 was the only [[Group 5 (racing)|Group 5]] car and won 13 of 14 races in the 1970 season and topped the lap records on every course.\n\nAfter a change of the rules to stop this dominance, Basil Green built 6 cars for the [[Group 2 (racing)|Group 2]].

The company has specialised in [[Ford]] vehicles, in which the manufacturer's models are recognised by the brand name ''Perana'' added to the model name. The name Perana is a deliberate misspelling, as ''Piranha'' already had been protected. Currently the company is active as a dealer of Ford and [[Mazda]] vehicles.\n\nFounded in 1967 by [[Basil Green]] the company dealt with [[engine tuning]] of Ford vehicles and participated in a variety of races as racing team. After winning several races the Ford Motor Company became aware of the company and used the company for some of the South African models as a kind of in-house tuner.\n\n==Cortina Mk II==\n{{Infobox automobile\n| name         = Gunston Cortina\n| image        = Gunston Cortina.jpg\n| caption      = Ford Cortina Gunston Perana\n| manufacturer = Basil Green Motors\n| assembly     = South Africa\n| production   = 1967\u20131972\n| 4-door [[sedan (car)|saloon]]\n| designer     =\n}}\nThe first model of the manufacturer was the Ford Cortina Perana V6, which was launched in 1967 as a tuning model. [[Serial production|Production]] began one year later in the summer. ''Grosvenor Motors'', then the largest Ford dealer in South Africa, took over the sales. The price was 2950 [[South African rand|Rand]]. The standard version was based on the [[Ford Cortina]] Mk II GT. For the units ordered by the [[Gunston Cigarette Company]], the Ford Cortina XL was used as basis. The [[Ford Essex V6 engine (UK)|Ford Essex engine]] with 2994 cc was used as engine. This was taken from the [[Ford Zephyr]] as well as the powertrain. After the conversion and lowering the Cortina Perana V6 was 64&nbsp;kg heavier than the Ford standard model. Recognition features of the Cortina Perana V6 are a black strip over the bonnet, a black front grille and black coloured rims.\n<div style=\"clear: both;\"></div>\n\n==Escort Mk I==\n{{Infobox automobile\n| name         = Escort Perana\n| image        = Escort_Perana.jpg\n| caption      = Ford Escort Perana\n| manufacturer = Basil Green Motors\n| assembly     = South Africa\n| production   = 1968 \u2013 ?\n| 2-door [[sedan (car)|saloon]]\n| designer     =\n}}\nThe second model of the manufacturer was 1968 the sports car [[Ford_Escort_(Europe)|Ford Escort]] ''Perana''. Ford wanted to use the RS&nbsp;1600, but the [[Cosworth#The_BDA_series|Cosworth BDA engine]] proved too complex for South Africa. So Basil Green made new plans and fitted the four cylinder engine of the [[Ford Pinto]].\n\nThe removed RS&nbsp;1600 engines Basil Green sold for 695 [[South African rand|Rand]] as ideal for among others the Escort.\n<div style=\"clear: both;\"></div>\n\n==Capri Mk I==\n{{Infobox automobile\n| name         = Capri Perana\n| image        = Capri_Perana_V8.jpg\n| caption      = Ford Capri Perana V8\n| manufacturer = Ford of South Africa\n| assembly     = South Africa\n| production   = 1969\u20131973\n| [[Coup\u00e9]]\n| designer     =\n}}\nThe next model, the ''[[Ford Capri]] Perana'' came out in 1969 as V6 version. About 20 units of this model were built; the top speed was 186 km/h. As Ford offered the Essex engine as standard from 1970 on, Basil Green had to take a more powerful engine. So he replaced the V6 with the [[Ford_Windsor_engine|Windsor]] V8 of the [[Ford Mustang]]. \n\nTechnically the Capri Perana was a mix of the Australian [[Ford Falcon (XW)]] and the American Ford Mustang. It was sold with a 4 speed [[Ford Toploader transmission]] and the 3 speed [[Ford C4 transmission|C4]] [[automatic transmission]]. In the beginning the price for this car was 4,450 Rand. \n\nTop speed was 228 km/h, acceleration from 0 to 100&nbsp;km/h was possible in 6.7 seconds (automatic version 7.0 sec). \n\nOfficially the Capri Perana was only sold in \"Bright Yellow\" and \"Piri Piri Red\", but some cars were painted in different colours, for example Basil Green's Perana naturally was green. \n\nThe cars were manufactured by Ford of South Africa (a subsidiary of the [[Ford Motor Company of Canada]]). Production ended in 1973.\n<div style=\"clear: both;\"></div>\n\n===Racing===\n{{Infobox automobile\n| name         = Gunston Perana\n| image        = Gunston_Perana_2009.jpg\n| caption      = Gunston Perana V8\n| manufacturer = Basil Green Motors\n| assembly     = South Africa\n| production   = 1969 \u2013 ?\n| [[Coup\u00e9]]\n| designer     =\n}}\nBased on the Capri Perana V8 racing cars were build for the [[South African Saloon Car Championship]].

In 2011, he joined the coaching staff of the [[IMG Academy]] in [[Bradenton, Florida]].\n\n==Playing career==\nKenna was born in [[Dublin]], but began his club career in England, beginning at [[Southampton F.C.|Southampton]] in 1988. He made his debut on 4 May 1991 in a 6\u20132 league defeat by [[Derby County F.C.|Derby County]] at the [[Baseball Ground]]. He became a first team regular in the [[1992\u201393 in English football|1992\u201393 season]] and remained a fixture in the first team until 15 March 1995, when he moved to [[Blackburn Rovers F.C.|Blackburn Rovers]] for a fee of \u00a31.5 million,<ref name = \"Sporting Heroes\">{{cite web|title=Jeff Kenna: career details |url=http://www.sporting-heroes.net/football/birmingham-city-fc/jeff-kenna-7443/2001-02-2003-04_a15879/|publisher=Sporting Heroes |accessdate=2 September 2012}}</ref> playing a part in the run-in to the club's [[FA Premier League|Premier League]] title that year.\n\nHe had played 114 league matches for the Saints, scoring four goals.<ref name = \"Sporting Heroes\"/>\n\nHe was a regular in the Blackburn team until the [[1999-2000 in English football|1999\u20132000 season]], after Blackburn had been relegated to [[Football League Division One|Division One]]. He made his final six appearances for Rovers in the [[2000\u201301 in English football|2000\u201301 season]]. During that campaign he had loan spells with [[Tranmere Rovers F.C.|Tranmere Rovers]] and [[Wigan Athletic F.C.|Wigan Athletic]], before finally exiting [[Ewood Park]] after nearly seven years to join [[Birmingham City F.C.|Birmingham City]] on a free transfer on 24 December 2001.<ref name = \"Sporting Heroes\"/>\n\nKenna scored three goals for Birmingham City after their promotion to the Premier League as Division One playoff winners at the end of the [[2001\u201302 in English football|2001\u201302 season]] \u2013 their first top division campaign in nearly 20 years.\n\nHe joined [[Derby County F.C.|Derby County]] on a free transfer in March 2004,<ref name = \"Sporting Heroes\"/> and was appointed club captain 2005, but was released at the end of the season in May 2006. In August 2006 he sealed a move to [[Kidderminster Harriers F.C.|Kidderminster Harriers]] in the [[Conference National]]. Along with [[Steve Guppy]], he became the first player to play at both Wembley stadiums, having played twice at the old ground, when he played for Kidderminster in their defeat to Stevenage in the FA Trophy Final 2007.\n\n==Management career==\nKenna was named [[Galway United]] manager (taking over from his former [[Republic of Ireland national under-21 football team|Republic of Ireland U21]] international team-mate [[Tony Cousins]]) in a press conference on 21 April 2008.<ref>[http://www.galwayunitedfc.ie/news-features/kenna-appointed-manager.html Kenna appointed manager]{{dead link|date=November 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> He lost his first match in charge 3\u20132 versus [[Bray Wanderers]].<ref>[http://www.galwayunitedfc.ie/match-reports/galway-united-2-bray-wanderers-3.html Result: Galway United 2 Bray Wanderers 3]{{dead link|date=November 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>\n\nAt the time taking over at United, the club were bottom of the table and haemorrhaging money. Due to league financial regulations a lot of the senior players were sold onto other clubs to ensure that the clubs salary expenditure fell within league requirements. On 15 July 2008, Kenna officially (albeit somewhat reluctantly) became [[player-manager]] at Galway United.<ref>[http://www.galwayunitedfc.ie/match-previews/kenna-becomes-playermanager.html Kenna becomes Player Manager]{{dead link|date=November 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>\n\nGalway were forced to rely on a lot of young inexperienced players, but as the season drew to a climax Kenna engendered a real team spirit in the side to the extent that over the last seven games United collected five wins, a draw and one loss. This enabled Galway to garner seventeen crucial points and narrowly avoid relegation to the First Division, pipping [[Finn Harps]] by a single point.[https://web.archive.org/web/20081110193712/http://www.rte.ie/sport/soccer/soccer_tables_index.html]. A wonderful feather in the cap of this fledgeling manager (he had also led the club to the last four of both the [[League of Ireland Cup|League Cup]] and the [[FAI Cup]]), Kenna was understood to be contracted for another season with Galway but decided to quit during the winter period.\n\nHe took the position of St. Patricks' Athletic manager on 15 January 2009. His first competitive match was a 3\u20130 home defeat at the hands of his previous club whose new manager, [[Ian Foster (footballer)|Ian Foster]], had been Kenna's assistant the season before. Indifferent league form (which included two more defeats at the hands of Galway) combined with the fact that he was commuting between Dublin and the UK saw Kenna come under pressure from the St. Pat's fans quite quickly, but a run to the Fourth Qualifying Round of the [[2009\u201310 UEFA Europa League|Europa League]] (which included a victory over Russian side [[FC Krylia Sovetov Samara|Krylia Sovetov]]) appeared to have\nweathered the storm.\n\nHowever, a 2\u20130 loss at home to First Division [[Waterford United]] in the quarter final of the [[FAI Cup]] ultimately led to Kenna's resignation as St. Patrick's Athletic manager on 18 September 2009.\n\nOn 1 August 2011, Kenna joined the coaching staff at the [[IMG Academy]] in [[Bradenton, Florida]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.imgacademies.com/soccer-academy/news/jeff-kenna-joins-the-img-soccer-academy/1219/ |title=Jeff Kenna joins IMG Academy |publisher=IMG Academy |date=1 August 2011 |accessdate=12 August 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110929231337/http://www.imgacademies.com/soccer-academy/news/jeff-kenna-joins-the-img-soccer-academy/1219/ |archivedate=29 September 2011 }}</ref>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center\"\n|+ Managerial record by team and tenure\n|-\n!rowspan=\"2\"|Team\n!rowspan=\"2\"|From\n!rowspan=\"2\"|To\n!colspan=\"8\"|Record\n|-\n!{{Tooltip|G|Games managed}}\n!{{Tooltip|W|Games won}}\n!{{Tooltip|D|Games drawn}}\n!{{Tooltip|L|Games lost}}\n!{{Tooltip|GF|Goals for}}\n!{{Tooltip|GA|Goals against}}\n!{{Tooltip|GD|Goal difference}}\n!{{Tooltip|Win %|Winning percentage}}\n|-\n| [[Galway United F.C.|Galway United]]\n| 21 April 2008\n| 14 January 2009\n{{WDL|34|13|8|13|for=44|against=41|diff=yes}}\n|-\n| [[St Patrick's Athletic F.C.|St Patrick's Athletic]]\n| 14 January 2009\n| 18 September 2009\n{{WDL|38|13|5|20|for=29|against=49|diff=yes}}\n|-\n|}\n\n==Family==\nKenna is the brother of [[heavyweight]] boxer [[Colin Kenna]] and second cousin of football manager [[Pat Scully]].

He made his debut on 4 May 1991 in a 6\u20132 league defeat by [[Derby County F.C.|Derby County]] at the [[Baseball Ground]]. He became a first team regular in the [[1992\u201393 in English football|1992\u201393 season]] and remained a fixture in the first team until 15 March 1995, when he moved to [[Blackburn Rovers F.C.|Blackburn Rovers]] for a fee of \u00a31.5 million,<ref name = \"Sporting Heroes\">{{cite web|title=Jeff Kenna: career details |url=http://www.sporting-heroes.net/football/birmingham-city-fc/jeff-kenna-7443/2001-02-2003-04_a15879/|publisher=Sporting Heroes |accessdate=2 September 2012}}</ref> playing a part in the run-in to the club's [[FA Premier League|Premier League]] title that year.\n\nHe had played 114 league matches for the Saints, scoring four goals.<ref name = \"Sporting Heroes\"/>\n\nHe was a regular in the Blackburn team until the [[1999-2000 in English football|1999\u20132000 season]], after Blackburn had been relegated to [[Football League Division One|Division One]]. He made his final six appearances for Rovers in the [[2000\u201301 in English football|2000\u201301 season]]. During that campaign he had loan spells with [[Tranmere Rovers F.C.|Tranmere Rovers]] and [[Wigan Athletic F.C.|Wigan Athletic]], before finally exiting [[Ewood Park]] after nearly seven years to join [[Birmingham City F.C.|Birmingham City]] on a free transfer on 24 December 2001.<ref name = \"Sporting Heroes\"/>\n\nKenna scored three goals for Birmingham City after their promotion to the Premier League as Division One playoff winners at the end of the [[2001\u201302 in English football|2001\u201302 season]] \u2013 their first top division campaign in nearly 20 years.\n\nHe joined [[Derby County F.C.|Derby County]] on a free transfer in March 2004,<ref name = \"Sporting Heroes\"/> and was appointed club captain 2005, but was released at the end of the season in May 2006.

Along with [[Steve Guppy]], he became the first player to play at both Wembley stadiums, having played twice at the old ground, when he played for Kidderminster in their defeat to Stevenage in the FA Trophy Final 2007.\n\n==Management career==\nKenna was named [[Galway United]] manager (taking over from his former [[Republic of Ireland national under-21 football team|Republic of Ireland U21]] international team-mate [[Tony Cousins]]) in a press conference on 21 April 2008.<ref>[http://www.galwayunitedfc.ie/news-features/kenna-appointed-manager.html Kenna appointed manager]{{dead link|date=November 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> He lost his first match in charge 3\u20132 versus [[Bray Wanderers]].<ref>[http://www.galwayunitedfc.ie/match-reports/galway-united-2-bray-wanderers-3.html Result: Galway United 2 Bray Wanderers 3]{{dead link|date=November 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>\n\nAt the time taking over at United, the club were bottom of the table and haemorrhaging money. Due to league financial regulations a lot of the senior players were sold onto other clubs to ensure that the clubs salary expenditure fell within league requirements. On 15 July 2008, Kenna officially (albeit somewhat reluctantly) became [[player-manager]] at Galway United.<ref>[http://www.galwayunitedfc.ie/match-previews/kenna-becomes-playermanager.html Kenna becomes Player Manager]{{dead link|date=November 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>\n\nGalway were forced to rely on a lot of young inexperienced players, but as the season drew to a climax Kenna engendered a real team spirit in the side to the extent that over the last seven games United collected five wins, a draw and one loss. This enabled Galway to garner seventeen crucial points and narrowly avoid relegation to the First Division, pipping [[Finn Harps]] by a single point.[https://web.archive.org/web/20081110193712/http://www.rte.ie/sport/soccer/soccer_tables_index.html].
