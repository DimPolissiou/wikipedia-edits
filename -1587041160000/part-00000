Typically it refers to a fallacious argumentative strategy whereby genuine discussion of the topic at hand is avoided by instead attacking the character, motive, or other attribute of the person making the argument, or persons associated with the argument, rather than attacking the substance of the argument itself. The most common form of this fallacy is \"A makes a claim ''a'', B asserts that A holds a property that is unwelcome, and hence B concludes that argument ''a'' is wrong\".\n\nThe valid types of ''ad hominem'' arguments are generally only encountered in specialist philosophical usage and typically refer to the dialectical strategy of using the target's own beliefs and arguments against them while not assenting to the validity of those beliefs and arguments.\n\n== History ==\n\n<!--Ancient history-->\nThe various types of ''ad hominem'' arguments have been known in the West since at least the ancient Greeks. [[Aristotle]], in his work ''[[Sophistical Refutations]]'', detailed the fallaciousness of putting the questioner but not the argument under scrutiny.{{sfn|Tindale|2007|p=82}} Many examples of ancient non-fallacious ''ad hominem'' arguments are preserved in the works of the [[Pyrrhonism|Pyrrhonist]] philosopher [[Sextus Empiricus]]. In these arguments, the concepts and assumptions of the opponents are used as part of a dialectical strategy against the opponents to demonstrate the unsoundness of their own arguments and assumptions. In this way, the arguments are to the person (''ad hominem''), but without attacking the properties of the individuals making the arguments.{{sfnm|1a1=Walton|1y=2001|1p=207-209|2a1=Wong|2y=2017|2p=49}} This kind of argument is also known as \"''argument from commitment.''\" \n\n<!--Modern era-->\nItalian polymath [[Galileo Galilei]] and British philosopher [[John Locke]] also examined the argument from commitment, a form of the ''ad hominem'' argument, meaning examining an argument on the basis of whether it stands true to the principles of the person carrying the argument. In the mid-19th century, the modern understanding of the term ''ad hominem'' started to take shape, with the broad definition given by English logician [[Richard Whately]]. According to Whately, ''ad hominem'' arguments were \"''addressed to the peculiar circumstances, character, avowed opinions, or past conduct of the individual.''\"{{sfn|Walton|2001|pp=208-210}}\n\n<!--Hablin and contemporary-->\nDuring the course of the years the term acquired a different meaning and by the the begining of the 20th century, it was link to a logical fallacy, in which a debator, instead of disproving an arguement, he opted for attacking his opponent. This approach was also poppularized in philosophical textbooks of the mid-20th century, and it was challenged by Charles Leonard Hamblin at the second half of twentieth century. In a detailed work, he suggested that the inclusion of  statement against a person in an argument, does not necessarily makes it a fallacious argument, since that particular phrase is not the a premise that leads to conclusion. While Hablin's criticism was not widely accepted, Canadian philosopher Douglas N. Walton examined the fallaciousness of the ad hominem even further.{{sfn|van Eemeren|Grootendorst|2015|pp=615-626}} Nowadays, except within specialized philosophical usages, the usage of the term ''ad hominem'' signifies a straight attack at the character and ethos of a person, in an attempt to refute its argument.{{sfn|Walton|2001|p=210}}\n\nExcept within specialized philosophical usages, the modern usage of the term ''ad hominem'' signifies a straight attack at the character and ethos of a person, in an attempt to refute its argument.{{sfn|Walton|2001|p=210}}\n\n== Terminology ==\n\nThe Latin phase ''argumentum ad hominem'' stands for \"argument against the person\".{{sfn|Tindale|2007|p=91}} \"Ad\" corresponds to \"against\" but it could also mean \"to\" or \"towards\".{{sfn|Wrisley|2019|pp=71-72}}\n\nThe terms ''ad mulierem'' and ''ad feminam'' have been used specifically when the person receiving the criticism is female.{{sfnm|1a1=Olivesi|1y=2010|2a1=Sommers|2y=1991}}\n\n== Types of ad hominem arguments ==\n{{see also|List of fallacies}}\n\n[[File:Graham's Hierarchy of Disagreement.svg|440px|thumb|''Ad hominem'' attack lies near the bottom end of [[Graham's Hierarchy of Disagreement]]]]\n\nFallacious ''ad hominem'' reasoning is categorized  among [[informal fallacy|informal fallacies]], more precisely as a [[genetic fallacy]], a subcategory of [[fallacies of irrelevance]].{{sfnm|1a1=Walton|1y=2008|1p=190|2a1=Bowell|2a2=Kemp|2y=2010|2pp=201-213|3a1=Copi|3y=1986|3pp=112-113}}\n\n''Ad hominem'' fallacies can be separated in various different types, among others are ''tu quoque'', circumstantial, guilt by association, and abusive ''ad hominem''. All of them are similar to the general scheme of ''ad hominem'' argument, that is instead of dealing with the essence of someones argument or trying to refute it, the interlocutor is attacking the character of the proponent of the argument and concluding that it is a sufficient reason to drop the initial argument.{{sfn|van Eemeren|2001|p=142}}\n\n=== ''Tu quoque'' ===\n{{main|Tu quoque}}\n''Ad hominem tu quoque'' (literally: \"You also\") is a response to a personal attack (or ''ad hominem'' argument) that itself is a personal attack.{{sfnm|1a1=Wrisley|1y=2019|1p=88|2a1=Walton|2y=2015|2pp= 431-435|3a1=Lavery|3a2=Hughes|3y=2008|3p=132}}\n\n''Tu quoque'' appears as: \n*A makes a claim ''a''.\n*B attacks the character of A by saying he holds a ''property x'', which is bad.\n*A defends himself by attacking B, saying he also holds the same ''property x''.{{sfn|Wrisley|2019|p=89}}\n\nHere is an example given by philosophy professor George Wrisley to illustrate the above: A businessman and politician is giving a lecture at a University about how good his company is and how nicely the system works. A student asks him \"Is it true that you and your company are selling weapons to third world rulers who use those arms against their own people?\" and the  businessman replies \"is it true that your university gets funding by the same company you are claiming it is selling guns to those countries? You are not a white dove either\". The ''ad hominem'' accusation of the student is relevant to the narrative the businessman tries to project thus not fallacious. On the other hand, the attack on the student (that is, the student being inconsistent) is irrelevant to the opening narrative. So the businessman's ''tu quoque'' response is fallacious.{{sfn|Wrisley|2019|pp=89-91}}\n\nPhilosopher [[Christopher Tindale]] approaches somewhat different the ''tu quoque'' fallacy. According to Tindale, a ''tu quoque'' fallacy appears when a response to an argument is made on the history of the arguer. This argument is also invalid because it does not disprove the premise; if the premise is true, then source A may be a [[hypocrite]] or even changed their mind, but this does not make the statement less credible from a logical perspective. A common example, given by Tindale, is when a doctor advises a patient to lose weight, but the patient argues that there is no need for him to go on a diet because the doctor is also overweight.{{sfn|Tindale|2007|pp=94-96}}\n\n=== Circumstantial ===\n{{main|Bulverism}}\n''Circumstantial ad hominem'' points out that someone is in circumstances (for instance, their job, wealth, property, or relations) such that they are disposed to take a particular position. It constitutes an attack on the bias of a source. As with other types of ''ad hominem'' attack, circumstantial attack could be fallacious or not. It could be fallacious because a disposition to make a certain argument does not make the argument invalid; this overlaps with the [[genetic fallacy]] (an argument that a claim is incorrect due to its source). But it also may be a sound argument, if the premises are correct and the bias is relevant to the argument.{{sfnm|1a1=Walton|1y=1998|1pp=18-21|2a1=Wrisley|2y=2019|2pp=77-78}}\n\nA simple example is: a father may tell his daughter not to start smoking because she will damage her health, and she may point out that he is or was a smoker. This does not alter the fact that smoking might cause various diseases. Her father's inconsistency is not a proper reason to reject his claim.{{sfn|Walton|2001|p=211}}\n\nPhilosopher and pundit on informal fallacies [[Douglas N. Walton]] argues that a circumstantial ''ad hominem'' argument can be non-fallacious. This could be the case when someone (A) attacks the personality of another person (B) making an argument (a) while the personality of B is relevant to argument a, i.e. B talks as an authority figure. To illustrate this reasoning, Walton gives the example of a witness at a trial, if he had been caught lying and cheating in his own life, should the jury take his word for granted? Not on Walton's watch.{{sfn|Walton|2001|p=213}}\n\n=== Guilt by association ===\n{{main|Association fallacy}}\nGuilt by association can sometimes also be a type of ''ad hominem'' fallacy if the argument attacks a source because of the similarity between the views of someone making an argument and other proponents of the argument.{{sfn|Walton|1998|pp=18-21}}\n\nThis form of the argument is as follows:\n# Source S makes claim C. \n# Group G, which is currently viewed negatively by the recipient, also makes claim C.\n# Therefore, source S is viewed by the recipient of the claim as associated to their group G and inherits how negatively viewed it is.\n\nAcademic Leigh Kolb gives as an example that the 2008 US vice\u2010presidential candidate [[Sarah Palin]] attacked [[Barack Obama]] for having worked with [[Bill Ayers]], who had been a leader in the [[Weather Underground]] terrorist group in the 1960s. Despite Obama's denouncing every act of terrorism, he was still associated by his opponents with terrorism.{{sfn|Kolb|2019|pp=351-352}}\n\nGuilt by association is frequently found in social and political debates. It also appears after horrible events, linked to a specific group. An example, given also by Leigh Kolb, is the peak of attacks against Muslims in the USA after the [[September_11_attacks| September 11 attacks]].{{sfn|Kolb|2019|pp=351-352}}\n\n===Abusive ''ad hominem''===\nAbusive ''ad hominem'' argument (or direct ''ad hominem'') is associated with an attack to the character of the person carrying an argument. This kind of argument, besides usually being fallacious, is also counterproductive, as a proper dialogue is hard to achieve after such an attack.{{sfn|Tindale|2007|pp=92-93}}{{sfn|Hansen|2019|loc= 1. The core fallacies}}{{sfn|Walton|2006|p=123}}\n\nAn ''ad hominem'' fallacy occurs when one attacks the character of an interlocutor in an attempt to refute their argument. Insulting someone is not necessarily an instance of an ''ad hominem'' fallacy. For example, if one supplies sufficient reasons to reject an interlocutor's argument and adds a slight character attack at the end, this character attack is not necessarily fallacious. Whether it is fallacious depends on whether or not the insult is used as a reason against the interlocutor's argument. An ''ad hominem'' occurs when an attack on the interlocutor's character functions as a response to an interlocutor's argument or claim.{{sfn|Wrisley|2019|p=83}}\n\nKey issues on examining an argument whether being an ''ad hominem'' fallacy or not are whether the accusation against the person stands true or not, whether the accusation is relevant to the argument. Lastly, it should be examined whether the ''ad hominem'' argument shortens or diminishes the counterargument. An example is a dialogue at the court, where the attorney cross-examines an eyewitness, bringing to light the fact that the witness was convicted in the past for lying. If the attorney's conclusion is that the witness is lying, that would be wrong. But if his argument would be that the witness should not be trusted, that would not be a fallacy.{{sfn|Wrisley|2019|pp=86-87}}\n\n=== Argument from commitment ===\nThe term ''ad hominem'' is used to refer to a type of valid argument that employs, as a dialectical strategy, the exclusive utilization of the beliefs, convictions, and assumptions of those holding the position being argued against, i.e., arguments constructed on the basis of what other people hold to be true. This usage is generally only encountered in specialist philosophical usage or in pre-20th century usages.{{sfn|Merriam-Webster|2019|loc=note1}} This type of argument is also known as \"argument from commitment\" or the ''ex concessis'' argument (Latin for \"from what has been conceded already\").{{sfn|Walton|2001}}\n\n== Usage in debates==\n''Ad hominem'' fallacies are considered to be uncivil and do not help creating a constructive atmosphere for dialogue to flourish.{{sfn|Weston|2018|p=82}} An ''ad hominem'' attack is an attack on the character of the target who tends to feel the necessity to defend himself from the accusation of being hypocrite\u2014not an easy task. It is so powerful of an argument it has been employed in many political debates. Since it is associated with negativity and dirty tricks, it has gained a bad fame, of being always fallacious.{{sfn|Walton|2006|p=122}}\n\nAuthor Eithan Orkibi, having studied the Israeli politics prior to elections, described two other forms of ''ad hominem'' attacks that are common during election periods. They both depend on the collective memory shared by both proponents and the audience. The first is the ''precedential ad hominem'', according to which the previous history of someone means that they do not fit for the office. It goes like this: \"My opponent was (allegedly) wrong in the past, therefore he is wrong now\". The second one, is a behavioral ''ad hominem'': \"my opponent was not a descent in his arguments in the past, so he is not now either\". These kinds of attacks are based on the inability of the audience to have a clear view of the statistical percentage of fault statements by both parts of the debate.{{sfn|Orkibi|2018|pp=497-498}}\n\n== Criticism as a fallacy ==\nCanadian academic and author [[Douglas N. Walton]] has argued that ''ad hominem'' reasoning is not always fallacious, and that in some instances, questions of personal conduct, character, motives, etc., are legitimate and relevant to the issue,{{sfn|Walton|2008|p=170}} as when it directly involves hypocrisy, or actions contradicting the subject's words.\n\nThe philosopher [[Charles Taylor (philosopher)|Charles Taylor]] has argued that ''ad hominem'' reasoning (discussing facts about the speaker or author relative to the value of his statements) is essential to understanding certain moral issues due to the connection between individual persons and morality (or moral claims), and contrasts this sort of reasoning with the [[apodicticity|apodictic]] reasoning (involving facts beyond dispute or clearly established) of philosophical naturalism.{{sfn|Taylor|1995|p=34-60}}\n\n== See also ==\n{{Portal|Philosophy}}\n{{div col|colwidth=20em}}\n* \"[[And you are lynching Negroes]]\"\n* [[Appeal to authority]]\n* [[Appeal to emotion]]\n* [[Appeal to motive]]\n* [[Association fallacy]]\n* [[Bulverism]]\n* [[Character assassination]]\n* [[Discrediting tactic]]\n* ''[[Ergo decedo]]''\n* [[Fair Game (Scientology)]]\n* [[Fake news]]\n* [[Fundamental attribution error]]\n* [[Gaslighting]]\n* [[Paul Graham (programmer)#Graham's hierarchy of disagreement|Graham's hierarchy of disagreement]]\n* [[Hostile witness]]\n* [[Negative campaigning]]\n* [[Poisoning the well]]\n* [[Presumption of guilt]] \n* [[Race card]]\n* [[Red herring]]\n* [[Reputation]]\n* [[Shooting the messenger]]\n* [[Smear campaign]]\n* [[Straw man]]\n* [[Tone policing]]\n* [[The Art of Being Right]]\n* ''[[Tu quoque]]''\n* [[Whataboutism]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n==Sources==\n*{{cite book|last1=Bowell|first1=Tracy|last2=Kemp|first2=Gary|title=Critical Thinking: A Concise Guide|year=2010|publisher=Routledge|location=Abingdon, Oxon|isbn=978-0-415-47183-1|ref=harv}}\n*{{cite book|last=Copi|first=Irving M.|title=Informal Logic|isbn=978-0-02-324940-2|publisher=Macmillan|year=1986|ref=harv}}\n*{{cite encyclopedia |last= Hansen|first= Hans|author-link= |editor-last= Zalta |editor-first= Edward N. |editor-link= Edward N.

Walton examined the fallaciousness of the ad hominem even further.{{sfn|van Eemeren|Grootendorst|2015|pp=615-626}} Nowadays, except within specialized philosophical usages, the usage of the term ''ad hominem'' signifies a straight attack at the character and ethos of a person, in an attempt to refute its argument.{{sfn|Walton|2001|p=210}}\n\nExcept within specialized philosophical usages, the modern usage of the term ''ad hominem'' signifies a straight attack at the character and ethos of a person, in an attempt to refute its argument.{{sfn|Walton|2001|p=210}}\n\n== Terminology ==\n\nThe Latin phase ''argumentum ad hominem'' stands for \"argument against the person\".{{sfn|Tindale|2007|p=91}} \"Ad\" corresponds to \"against\" but it could also mean \"to\" or \"towards\".{{sfn|Wrisley|2019|pp=71-72}}\n\nThe terms ''ad mulierem'' and ''ad feminam'' have been used specifically when the person receiving the criticism is female.{{sfnm|1a1=Olivesi|1y=2010|2a1=Sommers|2y=1991}}\n\n== Types of ad hominem arguments ==\n{{see also|List of fallacies}}\n\n[[File:Graham's Hierarchy of Disagreement.svg|440px|thumb|''Ad hominem'' attack lies near the bottom end of [[Graham's Hierarchy of Disagreement]]]]\n\nFallacious ''ad hominem'' reasoning is categorized  among [[informal fallacy|informal fallacies]], more precisely as a [[genetic fallacy]], a subcategory of [[fallacies of irrelevance]].{{sfnm|1a1=Walton|1y=2008|1p=190|2a1=Bowell|2a2=Kemp|2y=2010|2pp=201-213|3a1=Copi|3y=1986|3pp=112-113}}\n\n''Ad hominem'' fallacies can be separated in various different types, among others are ''tu quoque'', circumstantial, guilt by association, and abusive ''ad hominem''. All of them are similar to the general scheme of ''ad hominem'' argument, that is instead of dealing with the essence of someones argument or trying to refute it, the interlocutor is attacking the character of the proponent of the argument and concluding that it is a sufficient reason to drop the initial argument.{{sfn|van Eemeren|2001|p=142}}\n\n=== ''Tu quoque'' ===\n{{main|Tu quoque}}\n''Ad hominem tu quoque'' (literally: \"You also\") is a response to a personal attack (or ''ad hominem'' argument) that itself is a personal attack.{{sfnm|1a1=Wrisley|1y=2019|1p=88|2a1=Walton|2y=2015|2pp= 431-435|3a1=Lavery|3a2=Hughes|3y=2008|3p=132}}\n\n''Tu quoque'' appears as: \n*A makes a claim ''a''.\n*B attacks the character of A by saying he holds a ''property x'', which is bad.\n*A defends himself by attacking B, saying he also holds the same ''property x''.{{sfn|Wrisley|2019|p=89}}\n\nHere is an example given by philosophy professor George Wrisley to illustrate the above: A businessman and politician is giving a lecture at a University about how good his company is and how nicely the system works. A student asks him \"Is it true that you and your company are selling weapons to third world rulers who use those arms against their own people?\" and the  businessman replies \"is it true that your university gets funding by the same company you are claiming it is selling guns to those countries? You are not a white dove either\". The ''ad hominem'' accusation of the student is relevant to the narrative the businessman tries to project thus not fallacious. On the other hand, the attack on the student (that is, the student being inconsistent) is irrelevant to the opening narrative. So the businessman's ''tu quoque'' response is fallacious.{{sfn|Wrisley|2019|pp=89-91}}\n\nPhilosopher [[Christopher Tindale]] approaches somewhat different the ''tu quoque'' fallacy. According to Tindale, a ''tu quoque'' fallacy appears when a response to an argument is made on the history of the arguer. This argument is also invalid because it does not disprove the premise; if the premise is true, then source A may be a [[hypocrite]] or even changed their mind, but this does not make the statement less credible from a logical perspective. A common example, given by Tindale, is when a doctor advises a patient to lose weight, but the patient argues that there is no need for him to go on a diet because the doctor is also overweight.{{sfn|Tindale|2007|pp=94-96}}\n\n=== Circumstantial ===\n{{main|Bulverism}}\n''Circumstantial ad hominem'' points out that someone is in circumstances (for instance, their job, wealth, property, or relations) such that they are disposed to take a particular position. It constitutes an attack on the bias of a source. As with other types of ''ad hominem'' attack, circumstantial attack could be fallacious or not. It could be fallacious because a disposition to make a certain argument does not make the argument invalid; this overlaps with the [[genetic fallacy]] (an argument that a claim is incorrect due to its source). But it also may be a sound argument, if the premises are correct and the bias is relevant to the argument.{{sfnm|1a1=Walton|1y=1998|1pp=18-21|2a1=Wrisley|2y=2019|2pp=77-78}}\n\nA simple example is: a father may tell his daughter not to start smoking because she will damage her health, and she may point out that he is or was a smoker. This does not alter the fact that smoking might cause various diseases. Her father's inconsistency is not a proper reason to reject his claim.{{sfn|Walton|2001|p=211}}\n\nPhilosopher and pundit on informal fallacies [[Douglas N. Walton]] argues that a circumstantial ''ad hominem'' argument can be non-fallacious. This could be the case when someone (A) attacks the personality of another person (B) making an argument (a) while the personality of B is relevant to argument a, i.e. B talks as an authority figure. To illustrate this reasoning, Walton gives the example of a witness at a trial, if he had been caught lying and cheating in his own life, should the jury take his word for granted? Not on Walton's watch.{{sfn|Walton|2001|p=213}}\n\n=== Guilt by association ===\n{{main|Association fallacy}}\nGuilt by association can sometimes also be a type of ''ad hominem'' fallacy if the argument attacks a source because of the similarity between the views of someone making an argument and other proponents of the argument.{{sfn|Walton|1998|pp=18-21}}\n\nThis form of the argument is as follows:\n# Source S makes claim C. \n# Group G, which is currently viewed negatively by the recipient, also makes claim C.\n# Therefore, source S is viewed by the recipient of the claim as associated to their group G and inherits how negatively viewed it is.\n\nAcademic Leigh Kolb gives as an example that the 2008 US vice\u2010presidential candidate [[Sarah Palin]] attacked [[Barack Obama]] for having worked with [[Bill Ayers]], who had been a leader in the [[Weather Underground]] terrorist group in the 1960s. Despite Obama's denouncing every act of terrorism, he was still associated by his opponents with terrorism.{{sfn|Kolb|2019|pp=351-352}}\n\nGuilt by association is frequently found in social and political debates. It also appears after horrible events, linked to a specific group. An example, given also by Leigh Kolb, is the peak of attacks against Muslims in the USA after the [[September_11_attacks| September 11 attacks]].{{sfn|Kolb|2019|pp=351-352}}\n\n===Abusive ''ad hominem''===\nAbusive ''ad hominem'' argument (or direct ''ad hominem'') is associated with an attack to the character of the person carrying an argument. This kind of argument, besides usually being fallacious, is also counterproductive, as a proper dialogue is hard to achieve after such an attack.{{sfn|Tindale|2007|pp=92-93}}{{sfn|Hansen|2019|loc= 1. The core fallacies}}{{sfn|Walton|2006|p=123}}\n\nAn ''ad hominem'' fallacy occurs when one attacks the character of an interlocutor in an attempt to refute their argument. Insulting someone is not necessarily an instance of an ''ad hominem'' fallacy. For example, if one supplies sufficient reasons to reject an interlocutor's argument and adds a slight character attack at the end, this character attack is not necessarily fallacious. Whether it is fallacious depends on whether or not the insult is used as a reason against the interlocutor's argument. An ''ad hominem'' occurs when an attack on the interlocutor's character functions as a response to an interlocutor's argument or claim.{{sfn|Wrisley|2019|p=83}}\n\nKey issues on examining an argument whether being an ''ad hominem'' fallacy or not are whether the accusation against the person stands true or not, whether the accusation is relevant to the argument. Lastly, it should be examined whether the ''ad hominem'' argument shortens or diminishes the counterargument. An example is a dialogue at the court, where the attorney cross-examines an eyewitness, bringing to light the fact that the witness was convicted in the past for lying. If the attorney's conclusion is that the witness is lying, that would be wrong. But if his argument would be that the witness should not be trusted, that would not be a fallacy.{{sfn|Wrisley|2019|pp=86-87}}\n\n=== Argument from commitment ===\nThe term ''ad hominem'' is used to refer to a type of valid argument that employs, as a dialectical strategy, the exclusive utilization of the beliefs, convictions, and assumptions of those holding the position being argued against, i.e., arguments constructed on the basis of what other people hold to be true. This usage is generally only encountered in specialist philosophical usage or in pre-20th century usages.{{sfn|Merriam-Webster|2019|loc=note1}} This type of argument is also known as \"argument from commitment\" or the ''ex concessis'' argument (Latin for \"from what has been conceded already\").{{sfn|Walton|2001}}\n\n== Usage in debates==\n''Ad hominem'' fallacies are considered to be uncivil and do not help creating a constructive atmosphere for dialogue to flourish.{{sfn|Weston|2018|p=82}} An ''ad hominem'' attack is an attack on the character of the target who tends to feel the necessity to defend himself from the accusation of being hypocrite\u2014not an easy task. It is so powerful of an argument it has been employed in many political debates. Since it is associated with negativity and dirty tricks, it has gained a bad fame, of being always fallacious.{{sfn|Walton|2006|p=122}}\n\nAuthor Eithan Orkibi, having studied the Israeli politics prior to elections, described two other forms of ''ad hominem'' attacks that are common during election periods. They both depend on the collective memory shared by both proponents and the audience. The first is the ''precedential ad hominem'', according to which the previous history of someone means that they do not fit for the office. It goes like this: \"My opponent was (allegedly) wrong in the past, therefore he is wrong now\". The second one, is a behavioral ''ad hominem'': \"my opponent was not a descent in his arguments in the past, so he is not now either\". These kinds of attacks are based on the inability of the audience to have a clear view of the statistical percentage of fault statements by both parts of the debate.{{sfn|Orkibi|2018|pp=497-498}}\n\n== Criticism as a fallacy ==\nCanadian academic and author [[Douglas N. Walton]] has argued that ''ad hominem'' reasoning is not always fallacious, and that in some instances, questions of personal conduct, character, motives, etc., are legitimate and relevant to the issue,{{sfn|Walton|2008|p=170}} as when it directly involves hypocrisy, or actions contradicting the subject's words.\n\nThe philosopher [[Charles Taylor (philosopher)|Charles Taylor]] has argued that ''ad hominem'' reasoning (discussing facts about the speaker or author relative to the value of his statements) is essential to understanding certain moral issues due to the connection between individual persons and morality (or moral claims), and contrasts this sort of reasoning with the [[apodicticity|apodictic]] reasoning (involving facts beyond dispute or clearly established) of philosophical naturalism.{{sfn|Taylor|1995|p=34-60}}\n\n== See also ==\n{{Portal|Philosophy}}\n{{div col|colwidth=20em}}\n* \"[[And you are lynching Negroes]]\"\n* [[Appeal to authority]]\n* [[Appeal to emotion]]\n* [[Appeal to motive]]\n* [[Association fallacy]]\n* [[Bulverism]]\n* [[Character assassination]]\n* [[Discrediting tactic]]\n* ''[[Ergo decedo]]''\n* [[Fair Game (Scientology)]]\n* [[Fake news]]\n* [[Fundamental attribution error]]\n* [[Gaslighting]]\n* [[Paul Graham (programmer)#Graham's hierarchy of disagreement|Graham's hierarchy of disagreement]]\n* [[Hostile witness]]\n* [[Negative campaigning]]\n* [[Poisoning the well]]\n* [[Presumption of guilt]] \n* [[Race card]]\n* [[Red herring]]\n* [[Reputation]]\n* [[Shooting the messenger]]\n* [[Smear campaign]]\n* [[Straw man]]\n* [[Tone policing]]\n* [[The Art of Being Right]]\n* ''[[Tu quoque]]''\n* [[Whataboutism]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n==Sources==\n*{{cite book|last1=Bowell|first1=Tracy|last2=Kemp|first2=Gary|title=Critical Thinking: A Concise Guide|year=2010|publisher=Routledge|location=Abingdon, Oxon|isbn=978-0-415-47183-1|ref=harv}}\n*{{cite book|last=Copi|first=Irving M.|title=Informal Logic|isbn=978-0-02-324940-2|publisher=Macmillan|year=1986|ref=harv}}\n*{{cite encyclopedia |last= Hansen|first= Hans|author-link= |editor-last= Zalta |editor-first= Edward N. |editor-link= Edward N.

The first edition contained 86 stories, and by the seventh edition in 1857, had 210 unique fairy tales.\n\n== Origin ==\nJacob and Wilhelm Grimm were two of eight children from their mother Dorothea (N\u00e9e Zimmer) and father Philipp Wilhelm Grimm. Philipp was a highly regarded district magistrate in Steinau, near Kassel. Jacob and Wilhelm were sent to school for a classical education once they were of age, while their father was working. They were very hard-working pupils throughout their education. They followed in their father\u2019s footsteps and started to pursue a degree in law. However, in 1796, their father died at the age of 44 from pneumonia. This was a tragic time for the Grimms because the family lost all financial support and relied on their aunt, Henriette Zimmer, and grandfather, Johanne Hermann Zimmer. At the age of 11, Jacob was compelled to be head of the household and provide for his family. After down-sizing their home because of financial reasons, Henriette sent Jacob and Wilhelm to study at the prestigious high school, Lyzeum, in [[Kassel]]. In school, their grandfather wrote to them saying that because of their current situation, they needed to apply themselves industriously to secure their future welfare.<ref name=zipes>{{Cite book|title=The Brothers Grimm : from enchanted forests to the modern world|last=Zipes|first=Jack|date=2002|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|isbn=0312293801|location=Houndmills, Basingstoke, Hampshire|oclc=49698876}}</ref>\n\nShortly after attending Lyzeum, their grandfather died and they were again left to themselves to support their family in the future. The two became intent on becoming the best students at Lyzeum, since they wanted to live up to their deceased father. They studied more than twelve hours a day and established similar work habits. They also shared the same bed and room at school. After four years of rigorous schooling, Jacob graduated head of his class in 1802. Wilhelm contracted asthma and scarlet fever, which delayed his graduation by one year although he was also head of his class. Both were given special dispensations for studying law at the [[University of Marburg]]. They particularly needed this dispensation because their social standing at the time was not high enough to have normal admittance.  University of Marburg was a small, 200-person university where most students were more interested in activities other than schooling. Most of the students received stipends even though they were the richest in the state. The Grimms did not receive any stipends because of their social standing; however, they were not upset by it since it kept the distractions away.<ref name=zipes/>\n\n=== Professor Friedrich Carl von Savigny ===\nJacob attended the university first and showed proof of his hard work ethic and quick intelligence. Wilhelm joined Jacob at the university, and Jacob drew the attention of Professor [[Friedrich Carl von Savigny]], founder of its historical school of law. He became a huge personal and professional influence on the brothers. Throughout their time at university, the brothers became quite close with Savigny and were able to use his personal library as they became very interested in German law, history, and folklore. Savigny asked Jacob to join him in Paris as an assistant, and Jacob went with him for a year. While he was gone, Wilhelm became very interested in German literature and started collecting books. Once Jacob returned to Kassel in 1806, he adopted his brother's passion and changed his focus from law to German literature. While Jacob studied literature and took care of their siblings, Wilhelm continued on to receive his degree in law at Marburg.<ref name=zipes/> During the [[Napoleonic Wars]], Jacob interrupted his studies to serve the Hessian War Commission.<ref name=jackz/>\n\nIn 1808, their mother died, and it was hard on Jacob because he took the position in the family as a father figure, while also trying to be a brother. From 1806 to 1810, the Grimm family had barely enough money to properly feed and clothe themselves. During this time, Jacob and Wilhelm were concerned about the stability of the family.\n\n[[Ludwig Achim von Arnim|Achim von Arnim]] and [[Clemens Brentano]] were good friends of the brothers and wanted to publish folk tales, so they asked the brothers to collect oral tales for publication. The Grimms collected many old books and asked friends and acquaintances in Kassel to tell tales and to gather stories from others. Jacob and Wilhelm sought to collect these stories in order to write a history of old German Poesie and to preserve history.<ref name=zipes/>\n\n==Composition==\n\n\nThe first volume of the first edition was published in 1812, containing 86 stories; the second volume of 70 stories followed in 1815. For the second edition, two volumes containing the KHM texts were issued in 1819 and the Appendix was removed and published separately in the third volume in 1822, totaling 170 tales. The third edition appeared in 1837; fourth edition, 1840; fifth edition, 1843; sixth edition, 1850; seventh edition, 1857. Stories were added, and also subtracted, from one edition to the next, until the seventh held 210 tales. Some later editions were extensively illustrated, first by [[Philipp Grot Johann]] and, after his death in 1892, by German illustrator Robert Leinweber.{{citation needed|date=November 2013}}\n\nThe first volumes were much criticized because, although they were called \"Children's Tales\", they were not regarded as suitable for children, both for the scholarly information included and the subject matter.<ref>[[Maria Tatar]], ''The Hard Facts of the Grimms' Fairy Tales'', p15-17, {{ISBN|0-691-06722-8}}</ref>  Many changes through the editions&nbsp;\u2013 such as turning the wicked mother of the first edition in ''[[Snow White]]'' and ''[[Hansel and Gretel]]'' (shown in original Grimm stories as H\u00e4nsel and Grethel) to a stepmother, were probably made with an eye to such suitability. [[Jack Zipes]] believes that the Grimms made the change in later editions because they \u201cheld motherhood sacred\u201d.<ref>[https://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/nov/12/grimm-brothers-fairytales-horror-new-translation Flood, Alison. \"Grimm brothers\u2019 fairytales have blood and horror restored in new translation\", ''The Guardian'', November 12, 2014]</ref>\n\nThey removed sexual references\u2014such as [[Rapunzel]]'s innocently asking why her dress was getting tight around her belly, and thus naively revealing to the witch Dame Gothel her pregnancy and the prince's visits\u2014but, in many respects, violence, particularly when punishing villains, was increased.<ref>Maria Tatar, \"Reading the Grimms' Children's Stories and Household Tales\" p. xxvii-iv, Maria Tatar, ed. ''The Annotated Brothers Grimm.'', {{ISBN|0-393-05848-4}}</ref>\n\n== Popularity ==\nThe brothers' initial intention of their first book, ''Children\u2019s and Household Tales'', was to establish a name for themselves in the world. After publishing the first ''KHM'' in 1812, they published a second, augmented and re-edited, volume in 1815. In 1816 Volume I of the ''[[Deutsche Sagen| German Legends]]'' ({{lang-de|Deutsche Sagen}}) was published, followed in 1818, Volume II. However, the book that established their international success was not any of their tales, but Jacob\u2019s ''German Grammar'' in 1819. In 1825, the Brothers published their ''Kleine Ausgabe'' or \"small edition\", a selection of 50 tales designed for child readers. This children's version went through ten editions between 1825 and 1858.\n\nIn 1830, Jacob became a professor at [[University of G\u00f6ttingen]] and shortly after, in 1835, Wilhelm also became a professor. During these years Jacob wrote a third volume of ''[[German grammar|German Grammar]]'' and Wilhelm prepared the third revision of the ''Children\u2019s and Household Tales''.<ref name=zipes/>\n\nIn 1837, King [[Ernest Augustus, King of Hanover|Ernst August II]] revoked the constitution of 1833 and was attempting to restore [[Absolute monarchy|absolutism]] in the [[Kingdom of Hanover]]. Since G\u00f6ttingen was a part of Hanover, the brothers were expected to take an oath of allegiance. However, the brothers and five other professors led a protest against this and were heavily supported by the student body since all of these professors were well renowned. Jacob left G\u00f6ttingen immediately and Wilhelm followed him a few months later back to Kassel.<ref name=\"1937- 2002\">{{Cite book|title=The Brothers Grimm : from enchanted forests to the modern world|last=1937-|first=Zipes, Jack|date=2002|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|isbn=0312293801|location=Houndmills, Basingstoke, Hampshire|oclc=49698876}}</ref>\n\nIn Kassel, the Grimms devoted themselves to researching and studying. A close friend of theirs, [[Bettina von Arnim]], was also a talented writer. Savigny and others convinced the King of [[Kingdom of Prussia|Prussia]], [[Friedrich Wilhelm IV]], to allow the brothers to teach and conduct research at the [[University of Berlin]]. In March 1841, the brothers did just this and also continued to work on the ''[[German Dictionary]]''.<ref name=\"1937- 2002\"/>\n\n==Influence==\n''Kinder- und Hausm\u00e4rchen'' (Children and Household Tales) is listed by UNESCO in its Memory of the World Registry.<ref name=jackz>[https://www.neh.gov/humanities/2015/marchapril/feature/how-the-grimm-brothers-saved-the-fairy-tale Zipes, Jack. \"How the Grimm Brothers Saved the Fairy Tale\", ''Humanities'', March/April 2015]</ref>\n\nThe Grimms believed that the most natural and pure forms of culture were linguistic and based in history.<ref name=jackz/> The work of the Brothers Grimm influenced other collectors, both inspiring them to collect tales and leading them to similarly believe, in a spirit of [[romantic nationalism]], that the fairy tales of a country were particularly representative of it, to the neglect of cross-cultural influence.<ref>[https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2012/07/23/once-upon-a-time-3 Acocella, Joan. \"Once Upon a Time\", ''The New Yorker'', July 23, 2012]</ref> Among those influenced were the Russian [[Alexander Afanasyev]], the Norwegians [[Peter Christen Asbj\u00f8rnsen]] and [[J\u00f8rgen Moe]], the English [[Joseph Jacobs]], and [[Jeremiah Curtin]], an American who collected Irish tales.<ref>[[Jack Zipes]], ''The Great Fairy Tale Tradition: From Straparola and Basile to the Brothers Grimm'', p 846, {{ISBN|0-393-97636-X}}</ref>  There was not always a pleased reaction to their collection.

The first edition contained 86 stories, and by the seventh edition in 1857, had 210 unique fairy tales.\n\n== Origin ==\nJacob and Wilhelm Grimm were two of eight children from their mother Dorothea (N\u00e9e Zimmer) and father Philipp Wilhelm Grimm. Philipp was a highly regarded district magistrate in Steinau, near Kassel. Jacob and Wilhelm were sent to school for a classical education once they were of age, while their father was working. They were very hard-working pupils throughout their education. They followed in their father\u2019s footsteps and started to pursue a degree in law. However, in 1796, their father died at the age of 44 from pneumonia. This was a tragic time for the Grimms because the family lost all financial support and relied on their aunt, Henriette Zimmer, and grandfather, Johanne Hermann Zimmer. At the age of 11, Jacob was compelled to be head of the household and provide for his family. After down-sizing their home because of financial reasons, Henriette sent Jacob and Wilhelm to study at the prestigious high school, Lyzeum, in [[Kassel]]. In school, their grandfather wrote to them saying that because of their current situation, they needed to apply themselves industriously to secure their future welfare.<ref name=zipes>{{Cite book|title=The Brothers Grimm : from enchanted forests to the modern world|last=Zipes|first=Jack|date=2002|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|isbn=0312293801|location=Houndmills, Basingstoke, Hampshire|oclc=49698876}}</ref>\n\nShortly after attending Lyzeum, their grandfather died and they were again left to themselves to support their family in the future. The two became intent on becoming the best students at Lyzeum, since they wanted to live up to their deceased father. They studied more than twelve hours a day and established similar work habits. They also shared the same bed and room at school. After four years of rigorous schooling, Jacob graduated head of his class in 1802. Wilhelm contracted asthma and scarlet fever, which delayed his graduation by one year although he was also head of his class. Both were given special dispensations for studying law at the [[University of Marburg]]. They particularly needed this dispensation because their social standing at the time was not high enough to have normal admittance.  University of Marburg was a small, 200-person university where most students were more interested in activities other than schooling. Most of the students received stipends even though they were the richest in the state. The Grimms did not receive any stipends because of their social standing; however, they were not upset by it since it kept the distractions away.<ref name=zipes/>\n\n=== Professor Friedrich Carl von Savigny ===\nJacob attended the university first and showed proof of his hard work ethic and quick intelligence. Wilhelm joined Jacob at the university, and Jacob drew the attention of Professor [[Friedrich Carl von Savigny]], founder of its historical school of law. He became a huge personal and professional influence on the brothers. Throughout their time at university, the brothers became quite close with Savigny and were able to use his personal library as they became very interested in German law, history, and folklore. Savigny asked Jacob to join him in Paris as an assistant, and Jacob went with him for a year. While he was gone, Wilhelm became very interested in German literature and started collecting books. Once Jacob returned to Kassel in 1806, he adopted his brother's passion and changed his focus from law to German literature. While Jacob studied literature and took care of their siblings, Wilhelm continued on to receive his degree in law at Marburg.<ref name=zipes/> During the [[Napoleonic Wars]], Jacob interrupted his studies to serve the Hessian War Commission.<ref name=jackz/>\n\nIn 1808, their mother died, and it was hard on Jacob because he took the position in the family as a father figure, while also trying to be a brother. From 1806 to 1810, the Grimm family had barely enough money to properly feed and clothe themselves. During this time, Jacob and Wilhelm were concerned about the stability of the family.\n\n[[Ludwig Achim von Arnim|Achim von Arnim]] and [[Clemens Brentano]] were good friends of the brothers and wanted to publish folk tales, so they asked the brothers to collect oral tales for publication. The Grimms collected many old books and asked friends and acquaintances in Kassel to tell tales and to gather stories from others. Jacob and Wilhelm sought to collect these stories in order to write a history of old German Poesie and to preserve history.<ref name=zipes/>\n\n==Composition==\n\n\nThe first volume of the first edition was published in 1812, containing 86 stories; the second volume of 70 stories followed in 1815. For the second edition, two volumes containing the KHM texts were issued in 1819 and the Appendix was removed and published separately in the third volume in 1822, totaling 170 tales. The third edition appeared in 1837; fourth edition, 1840; fifth edition, 1843; sixth edition, 1850; seventh edition, 1857. Stories were added, and also subtracted, from one edition to the next, until the seventh held 210 tales. Some later editions were extensively illustrated, first by [[Philipp Grot Johann]] and, after his death in 1892, by German illustrator Robert Leinweber.{{citation needed|date=November 2013}}\n\nThe first volumes were much criticized because, although they were called \"Children's Tales\", they were not regarded as suitable for children, both for the scholarly information included and the subject matter.<ref>[[Maria Tatar]], ''The Hard Facts of the Grimms' Fairy Tales'', p15-17, {{ISBN|0-691-06722-8}}</ref>  Many changes through the editions&nbsp;\u2013 such as turning the wicked mother of the first edition in ''[[Snow White]]'' and ''[[Hansel and Gretel]]'' (shown in original Grimm stories as H\u00e4nsel and Grethel) to a stepmother, were probably made with an eye to such suitability. [[Jack Zipes]] believes that the Grimms made the change in later editions because they \u201cheld motherhood sacred\u201d.<ref>[https://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/nov/12/grimm-brothers-fairytales-horror-new-translation Flood, Alison. \"Grimm brothers\u2019 fairytales have blood and horror restored in new translation\", ''The Guardian'', November 12, 2014]</ref>\n\nThey removed sexual references\u2014such as [[Rapunzel]]'s innocently asking why her dress was getting tight around her belly, and thus naively revealing to the witch Dame Gothel her pregnancy and the prince's visits\u2014but, in many respects, violence, particularly when punishing villains, was increased.<ref>Maria Tatar, \"Reading the Grimms' Children's Stories and Household Tales\" p. xxvii-iv, Maria Tatar, ed. ''The Annotated Brothers Grimm.'', {{ISBN|0-393-05848-4}}</ref>\n\n== Popularity ==\nThe brothers' initial intention of their first book, ''Children\u2019s and Household Tales'', was to establish a name for themselves in the world. After publishing the first ''KHM'' in 1812, they published a second, augmented and re-edited, volume in 1815. In 1816 Volume I of the ''[[Deutsche Sagen| German Legends]]'' ({{lang-de|Deutsche Sagen}}) was published, followed in 1818, Volume II. However, the book that established their international success was not any of their tales, but Jacob\u2019s ''German Grammar'' in 1819. In 1825, the Brothers published their ''Kleine Ausgabe'' or \"small edition\", a selection of 50 tales designed for child readers. This children's version went through ten editions between 1825 and 1858.\n\nIn 1830, Jacob became a professor at [[University of G\u00f6ttingen]] and shortly after, in 1835, Wilhelm also became a professor. During these years Jacob wrote a third volume of ''[[German grammar|German Grammar]]'' and Wilhelm prepared the third revision of the ''Children\u2019s and Household Tales''.<ref name=zipes/>\n\nIn 1837, King [[Ernest Augustus, King of Hanover|Ernst August II]] revoked the constitution of 1833 and was attempting to restore [[Absolute monarchy|absolutism]] in the [[Kingdom of Hanover]]. Since G\u00f6ttingen was a part of Hanover, the brothers were expected to take an oath of allegiance. However, the brothers and five other professors led a protest against this and were heavily supported by the student body since all of these professors were well renowned. Jacob left G\u00f6ttingen immediately and Wilhelm followed him a few months later back to Kassel.<ref name=\"1937- 2002\">{{Cite book|title=The Brothers Grimm : from enchanted forests to the modern world|last=1937-|first=Zipes, Jack|date=2002|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|isbn=0312293801|location=Houndmills, Basingstoke, Hampshire|oclc=49698876}}</ref>\n\nIn Kassel, the Grimms devoted themselves to researching and studying. A close friend of theirs, [[Bettina von Arnim]], was also a talented writer. Savigny and others convinced the King of [[Kingdom of Prussia|Prussia]], [[Friedrich Wilhelm IV]], to allow the brothers to teach and conduct research at the [[University of Berlin]]. In March 1841, the brothers did just this and also continued to work on the ''[[German Dictionary]]''.<ref name=\"1937- 2002\"/>\n\n==Influence==\n''Kinder- und Hausm\u00e4rchen'' (Children and Household Tales) is listed by UNESCO in its Memory of the World Registry.<ref name=jackz>[https://www.neh.gov/humanities/2015/marchapril/feature/how-the-grimm-brothers-saved-the-fairy-tale Zipes, Jack. \"How the Grimm Brothers Saved the Fairy Tale\", ''Humanities'', March/April 2015]</ref>\n\nThe Grimms believed that the most natural and pure forms of culture were linguistic and based in history.<ref name=jackz/> The work of the Brothers Grimm influenced other collectors, both inspiring them to collect tales and leading them to similarly believe, in a spirit of [[romantic nationalism]], that the fairy tales of a country were particularly representative of it, to the neglect of cross-cultural influence.<ref>[https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2012/07/23/once-upon-a-time-3 Acocella, Joan. \"Once Upon a Time\", ''The New Yorker'', July 23, 2012]</ref> Among those influenced were the Russian [[Alexander Afanasyev]], the Norwegians [[Peter Christen Asbj\u00f8rnsen]] and [[J\u00f8rgen Moe]], the English [[Joseph Jacobs]], and [[Jeremiah Curtin]], an American who collected Irish tales.<ref>[[Jack Zipes]], ''The Great Fairy Tale Tradition: From Straparola and Basile to the Brothers Grimm'', p 846, {{ISBN|0-393-97636-X}}</ref>  There was not always a pleased reaction to their collection.

''The Annotated Brothers Grimm'', {{ISBN|0-393-05848-4}}</ref>  The tales themselves have been put to many uses.

''The Annotated Brothers Grimm'', {{ISBN|0-393-05848-4}}</ref>\n\nThree individual works of Wilhelm Grimm include ''Altd\u00e4nische Heldenlieder, Balladen und M\u00e4rchen'' ('Old Danish Heroic Songs, Ballads, and Folktales') in 1811, ''\u00dcber deutsche Runen'' ('On German Runes') in 1821, and ''Die deutsche Heldensage'' ('The German Heroic Saga') in 1829.\n\nThe Grimm anthology has been a source of inspiration for artists and composers.
