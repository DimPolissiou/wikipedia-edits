The campaign was carried out by the armed forces of the [[South Vietnam|Republic of Vietnam]] (South Vietnam) between 8 February and 25 March 1971, during the [[Vietnam War]]. The United States provided logistical, aerial, and artillery support to the operation, but its ground forces were prohibited by law from entering Laotian territory. The objective of the campaign was the disruption of a possible future offensive by the [[People's Army of Vietnam]] (PAVN), whose logistical system within Laos was known as the [[Ho Chi Minh trail|Ho Chi Minh Trail]] (the Truong Son Road to [[North Vietnam]]).\n\nBy launching such a spoiling attack against PAVN's long-established logistical system, the American and South Vietnamese high commands hoped to resolve several pressing issues. A quick victory in Laos would bolster the morale and confidence of the [[Army of the Republic of Vietnam]] (ARVN), which was already high in the wake of the successful [[Cambodian Campaign]] of 1970. It would also serve as proof positive that South Vietnamese forces could defend their nation in the face of the continuing withdrawal of U.S. ground combat forces from the theater. The operation would be, therefore, a test of that policy and ARVN's capability to operate effectively by itself.\n\nBecause of the South Vietnamese need for security which precluded thorough planning, an inability by the political and military leaders of the U.S. and South Vietnam to face military realities, and poor execution, Operation ''Lam Son 719'' collapsed when faced by the determined resistance of a skillful foe. The campaign was a disaster<ref name=\"Sander\"/> for the ARVN, demonstrating deficiencies in ARVN military leaders and that the best units of the ARVN could be defeated by PAVN<ref name=Tucker>Spencer C. Tucker , p.2471</ref> and destroying the confidence that had been built up over the previous three years.\n\n==Background==\nBetween 1959 and 1970, the Ho Chi Minh Trail had become the key logistical artery for PAVN and the [[Viet Cong]] (VC), in their effort to conduct military operations to topple the U.S.-supported government of South Vietnam and create a unified nation. Running from the southwestern corner of North Vietnam through southeastern Laos and into the western portions of South Vietnam, the trail system had been the target of continuous U.S. aerial interdiction efforts that had begun in 1966. Only small-scale covert operations in support of the air campaigns had, however, been conducted on the ground inside Laos to halt the flow of men and supplies on the trail.<ref>{{cite book|last=Van Staaveren|first=Jacob|title=Interdiction in Southern Laos|publisher=Center of Air Force History|year=1993|isbn=9781410220608|url=https://media.defense.gov/2010/Sep/27/2001329814/-1/-1/0/AFD-100927-078.pdf|page=}}{{PD-notice}}</ref><ref name=Nalty/><ref>{{cite book|last=Plaster|first=John|title=Secret Commandos: Behind Enemy Lines with the Elite Warriors of SOG|publisher=Simon & Schuster|year=2004|isbn=9781501183454|page=}}</ref>\n\nSince 1966, over 630,000 men, 100,000 tons of foodstuffs, 400,000 weapons, and 50,000 tons of ammunition had traveled through the maze of gravel and dirt roads, paths, and river transportation systems that crisscrossed southeastern Laos. The trail also linked up with a similar logistical system in neighboring [[Cambodia]] known as the [[Sihanouk Trail]].<ref name=Fulghum/>{{rp|65}} However, following the overthrow of Prince [[Norodom Sihanouk]] in 1970, the pro-American [[Lon Nol]] regime had denied the use of the port of [[Sihanoukville (city)|Sihanoukville]] to communist shipping. Strategically, this was an enormous blow to the North Vietnamese effort, since 70 percent of all military supplies that supported its effort in the far south had moved through the port.<ref name=Isaacs>{{cite book|last1=Isaacs|first1=Arnold|last2=Hardy|first2=Gordon|title=The Vietnam Experience Pawns of War: Cambodia and Laos|publisher=Boston Publishing Company|year=1987|isbn=9780939526246|page=[https://archive.org/details/pawnsofwarcambod00isaa/page/89 89]|url=https://archive.org/details/pawnsofwarcambod00isaa/page/89}}</ref> A further blow to the logistical system in Cambodia had come in the spring and summer of 1970, when U.S. and ARVN forces had crossed the border and attacked PAVN/VC Base Areas during the [[Cambodian Campaign]].\n\nWith the partial destruction of the North Vietnamese logistical system in Cambodia, the U.S. headquarters in [[Ho Chi Minh City|Saigon]] determined that the time was propitious for a similar campaign in Laos. If such an operation were to be carried out, the U.S. command believed, it would be best to do it quickly, while American military assets were still available in South Vietnam. Such an operation would create supply shortages that would be felt by PAVN/VC forces 12\u201318 months later, as the last U.S. troops were leaving South Vietnam and thereby give the U.S. and its ally a respite from a possible communist offensive in the northern provinces for one year, possibly even two.<ref name=Stanton>{{cite book|last=Stanton|first=Shelby|title=The Rise and Fall of an American Army: U.S. Ground Forces in Vietnam, 1963-1973|publisher=Dell|year=1985|isbn=9780891418276|page=333}}</ref>\n\nThere were increasing signs of heavy communist logistical activity in southeastern Laos, activity which heralded just such a North Vietnamese offensive.<ref name=Palmer>{{cite book|last=Palmer|first=Dave|title=Summons of the Trumpet: A History of the Vietnam War from a Military Man's Viewpoint|publisher=Presidio Press|year=1978|isbn=9780345315830|page=303}}</ref> Communist offensives usually took place near the conclusion of the Laotian dry season (from October through March) and, for PAVN logistical forces, the push to move supplies through the system came during the height of the season.

Admiral [[John S. McCain Jr]] ([[CINCPAC]]) communicated with Admiral [[Thomas Moorer]], chairman of the Joint Chiefs, that an offensive against the Ho Chi Minh Trail might compel Prince [[Souvanna Phouma]], prime minister of Laos, \"to abandon the guise of neutrality and enter the war openly.\" Although technically neutral, the Laotian government had allowed the CIA and U.S. Air Force to conduct a covert war against an indigenous guerrilla insurgency (the Pathet Lao), that was, in turn, heavily supported by regular North Vietnamese forces.<ref name=Nalty/>{{rp|247}}\n\nOn 7 January 1971 MACV was authorized to begin detailed planning for an attack against PAVN Base Areas 604 and 611. The task was given to the commander of [[XXIV Corps (United States)|XXIV Corps]], Lieutenant General [[James W. Sutherland]], who had only nine days to submit it to MACV for approval.<ref name=Nolan/>{{rp|30}} The operation would consist of four phases. During the first phase U.S. forces inside South Vietnam would seize the border approaches and conduct diversionary operations. Next would come an ARVN armored/infantry attack along [[National Road 9 (Vietnam)|Route 9]] toward the Laotian town of [[Tchepone]], the perceived nexus of Base Area 604. The village was estimated to have had about 1,500 inhabitants in 1960; five years later, half of the residents had fled due to war; Operation Lam Son 719 then destroyed the village and left it deserted.<ref>{{cite book|last=Collins|first=John|title=Military Geography for Professionals and the Public|publisher=National Defense University Press|year=1998|isbn=9781330965832|page=372}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last=Miller|first=John|title=The Co-Vans: US Marine Advisors in Vietnam|publisher=Naval Institute Press|year=2000|isbn=9781557505491|page=146}}</ref> This advance would be protected by a series of leap-frogging aerial infantry assaults to cover the northern and southern flanks of the main column. During the third phase, search and destroy operations within Base Area 604 would be carried out and finally, the South Vietnamese force would retire either back along Route 9 or through Base Area 611 and exit through the [[A Shau Valley]].<ref name=Palmer/>{{rp|304}} It was hoped that the force could remain in Laos until the rainy season was underway at the beginning of May. U.S. planners had previously estimated that such an operation would require the commitment of four U.S. divisions (60,000 men), while Saigon would only commit a force half that size.<ref name=Karnow>{{cite book|last=Karnow|first=Stanley|title=Vietnam: A History|url=https://archive.org/details/vietnamhistory00karn|url-access=registration|publisher=Viking|year=1983|isbn=9780140265477|page=[https://archive.org/details/vietnamhistory00karn/page/629 629]}}</ref>\n\nBecause of the notorious laxity of the South Vietnamese military when it came to security precautions and the uncanny ability of communist agents to uncover operational information, the planning phase lasted only a few weeks and was divided between the American and Vietnamese high commands.<ref name=Prados/>{{rp|322\u20134}} At the lower levels, it was limited to the intelligence and operational staffs of ARVN's [[I Corps (South Vietnam)|I Corps]], under Lieutenant General [[Ho\u00e0ng Xu\u00e2n L\u00e3m]], who was to command the operation, and the XXIV Corps, headed by General Sutherland. When L\u00e3m was finally briefed by MACV and the South Vietnamese Joint General Staff in Saigon, his chief of operations was forbidden to attend the meeting, even though he had helped to write the very plan under discussion.<ref name=Nalty/>{{rp|252}} At this meeting, L\u00e3m's operational area was restricted to a corridor no wider than {{convert|15|mi}} on either side of Route 9 and a penetration no deeper than Tchepone.<ref name=Palmer/>\n\nCommand, control, and coordination of the operation was going to be problematic, especially in the highly politicized South Vietnamese command structure, where the support of key political figures was of paramount importance in promotion to and retention of command positions.<ref name=Fulghum/>{{rp|57\u20138}}<ref name=Karnow/>{{rp|630}} Lieutenant General [[L\u00ea Nguy\u00ean Khang]], the [[Republic of Vietnam Marine Division|Vietnamese Marine Corps]] commander and protege of Vice President [[Nguyen Cao Ky]], whose troops were scheduled to participate in the operation, actually outranked General L\u00e3m, who had the support of President [[Nguy\u1ec5n V\u0103n Thi\u1ec7u]]. The same situation applied to Lieutenant General [[D\u01b0 Qu\u1ed1c \u0110\u1ed1ng]], commander of ARVN [[Republic of Vietnam Airborne Division|Airborne]] forces also scheduled to participate in the operation. After the incursion began, both men remained in Saigon and delegated their command authority to junior officers rather than take orders from L\u00e3m.<ref name=Nolan/>{{rp|104\u20135}} This did not bode well for the success of the operation.\n\nIndividual units did not learn about their planned participation until 17 January. The Airborne Division that was to lead the operation received no detailed plans until 2 February, less than a week before the campaign was to begin.<ref name=Fulghum/>{{rp|70}} This was of crucial importance, since many of the units, particularly the Airborne and the Marines, had worked as separate battalions and brigades and had no experience maneuvering or cooperating in adjoining areas. According to the assistant commander of the [[U.S. 101st Airborne Division]], \"Planning was rushed, handicapped by security restrictions, and conducted separately and in isolation by the Vietnamese and the Americans.\"<ref name=Fulghum/>{{rp|72}}\n\nThe U.S. portion of the operation was to bear the title ''Dewey Canyon II'', named for [[Operation Dewey Canyon]] conducted by U.S. Marines in the northwestern South Vietnam in 1969. It was hoped that the reference to the previous operation would confuse Hanoi as to the actual target of the proposed incursion. The ARVN's portion was given the title ''Lam Son 719'', after the village of Lam Son, birthplace of the legendary Vietnamese patriot [[L\u00ea L\u1ee3i]], who had defeated an invading Chinese army in 1427. The numerical designation came from the year, 1971, and the main axis of the attack, Route 9.\n\nThe decisions had been made at the highest levels and planning had been completed, but valuable time had been lost. The South Vietnamese were about to begin their largest, most complex, and most important operation of the war. The lack of time for adequate planning and preparation, as well as the absence of any real questioning about military realities and the capabilities of the ARVN were going to prove decisive.<ref name=Fulghum/>{{rp|66}} On 29 January President Nixon gave his final approval for the operation. On the following day, Operation ''Dewey Canyon II'' was under way.\n\n==Operations==\n===Dewey Canyon II===\nAny offensive planning by the U.S. was, however, limited by the passage on 29 December 1970 of the [[Cooper-Church Amendment]], which prohibited U.S. ground forces and advisors from entering Laos. ''Dewey Canyon II'' would, therefore, be conducted within territorial South Vietnam in order to reopen Route 9 all the way to the old [[Khe Sanh Combat Base]], which had been abandoned by U.S. forces in 1968. The base would be reopened and would then serve as the logistical hub and airhead of the ARVN incursion. U.S. combat engineers were tasked with clearing Route 9 and rehabilitating Khe Sanh while infantry and mechanized units secured a line of communications along the length of the road. American artillery units would support the ARVN effort within Laos from the South Vietnamese side of the border while Army logisticians coordinated the entire supply effort for the South Vietnamese. Air support for the incursion would be provided by the aircraft of the U.S. Air Force, Navy, and Marine Corps, and U.S. Army aviation units were tasked with providing complete helicopter support for the ARVN operation.<ref name=Nolan/>{{rp|31}}\n\nU.S. forces earmarked for these missions included: four battalions of the 108th Artillery Group; two battalions of the 45th Engineer Group; the 101st Airborne Division; six battalions of the 101st Aviation Group; the 1st Brigade of the [[U.S. 5th Infantry Division|5th (Mechanized) Infantry Division]] (reinforced by two mechanized, one cavalry, one tank, and one airmobile infantry battalions; and the two battalions of the 11th Infantry Brigade of the [[23rd Infantry Division (United States)|23rd Infantry Division]].<ref name=Stanton/>{{rp|334}}\n[[File:Khe Sanh reoccuppied, Operation Lam Son 719, 12 February 1971.tif|thumb|right|Helicopters and supply vehicles at Khe Sanh, 12 February 1971]]\nOn the morning of 30 January, armor/engineer elements of the 1st Brigade, 5th Infantry Division headed west on Route 9 while the brigade's infantry elements were helilifted directly into the Khe Sanh area. By 5 February, Route 9 had been secured up to the Laotian frontier.<ref name=Prados/>{{rp|330\u20131}} Simultaneously, the 101st Airborne Division began a feint into the A Shau Valley in order to draw PAVN attention away from Khe Sanh. At the combat base, poor weather, obstacles, land mines, and unexploded ordnance pushed the rehabilitation of the airstrip (estimated by U.S. engineers at four days) a week behind schedule. As a response, a completely new airstrip had to be built and the first aircraft arrived on 15 February.<ref name=Palmer/>{{rp|306}} PAVN resistance was almost nonexistent and American casualties were light; with no previous allied presence around Khe Sanh, the North Vietnamese had seen no need to maintain large forces in the area.<ref name=Nolan/>{{rp|82}} However, General Sutherland believed that the advance to Khe Sanh had been a race between American and PAVN forces, and the U.S. had won.<ref name=Nolan/>{{rp|82}}\n\nIn order to preserve the security of the upcoming South Vietnamese operation, General Abrams had imposed a rare press embargo on the reporting of troop movements, but it was to no avail. Communist and non-American news agencies released reports of the build-up and even before the lifting of the embargo on 4 February, speculation concerning the offensive was front page news in the U.S.<ref name=Fulghum/>{{rp|72}} As had been the case during the Cambodian campaign, the government of Laos was not notified in advance of the intended operation. Prime Minister Souvanna Phouma would learn of the invasion of the PAVN occupied portions of his supposedly \"neutral\" nation only after it was under way.<ref name=Karnow/>{{rp|630}}\n\n===Offensive===\nBy early 1971, North Vietnamese troop strength in the Base Area 604 area was estimated by U.S. intelligence at 22,000 men: 7,000 combat troops, 10,000 personnel in logistical and support units, and 5,000 [[Pathet Lao]], all under the command of the newly created ''70th Front''.<ref name=Fulghum/>{{rp|66}} There were differing views on what the expected reaction of PAVN to the offensive might be. General Abrams believed that unlike Cambodia, the North Vietnamese would stand and fight for the Laotian Base Areas. As early as 11 December he had reported to Admiral McCain that:\n<blockquote>strong infantry, armor, and artillery formations were in southern Laos...formidable air defenses were deployed...the mountainous, jungle-covered terrain was an added liability. Natural clearings for helicopter landing zones were scarce and likely to be heavily defended.

Tactical air strikes and artillery preparations would neutralize the estimated 170 to 200 anti-aircraft artillery weapons believed to be in the area, and the threat posed by PAVN armored units was considered minimal. North Vietnamese reinforcement capability was set at 14 days by two divisions north of the [[Vietnamese Demilitarized Zone|DMZ]], and it was hoped that diversionary operations would occupy them for the duration of the operation.<ref name=Fulghum/>{{rp|72}} Unfortunately, when North Vietnamese reinforcements did arrive, they did not come from the north as expected, but from Base Area 611 and the A Shau Valley to the south, where eight regiments, all supported by organic artillery units, were within two weeks marching range.\n\nThe North Vietnamese were expecting some sort of operation as early as 26 January when the text of an intercepted radio message read \"It has been determined that the enemy may strike into our cargo carrier system in order to cut it off...Prepare to mobilize and strike the enemy hard.

After a massive preliminary artillery bombardment and 11 [[B-52 Stratofortress]] missions, the incursion began on 8 February, when a 4,000-man ARVN armor/infantry task force consisting of the 3rd Armored Brigade and the 1st and 8th Airborne Battalions, advanced west unopposed along Route 9. To cover the northern flank, ARVN Airborne and Ranger elements were deployed to the north of the main advance. The 39th Ranger Battalion was helilifted into a Landing Zone (LZ) known as Ranger North ({{Coord|16.744|N|106.493|E|display=inline}}) while the 21st Ranger Battalion moved into Ranger South ({{Coord|16.736|N|106.472|E|display=inline}}). These outposts were to serve as tripwires for any communist advance into the zone of the ARVN incursion. Meanwhile, the 2nd Airborne Battalion occupied Fire Support Base (FSB) 30 ({{Coord|16.696|N|106.486|E|display=inline}}) while the 3rd Airborne Brigade Headquarters and the 3rd Airborne Battalion went into FSB 31 ({{Coord|16.715|N|106.426|E|display=inline}}).

Almost immediately, supporting helicopters began to take fire from the heights, which allowed PAVN gunners to fire down on the aircraft from pre-registered machine gun and mortar positions. Making matters worse for the advance, Route 9 was in poor condition, so poor in fact that only tracked vehicles and jeeps could make the westward journey. This threw the burden of reinforcement and resupply onto the aviation assets. The helicopter units then became the essential mode of logistical support, a role that was made increasingly more dangerous due to low cloud cover and incessant anti-aircraft fire.<ref name=Airwar>{{cite book|last=Nalty|first=Bernard C.

By 11 February A Luoi had become the central fire base and command center for the operation.

Hanoi's attention was riveted on another diversionary maneuver being conducted by a U.S. naval task force off the coast of the North Vietnam. This force conducted all of the maneuvers necessary for the carrying out of an amphibious landing only 20 kilometers off the city of [[Vinh]].<ref name=Prados/>{{rp|338}} Hanoi's preoccupation with a possible invasion did not last long. Its B-70 Corps commanded three divisions in the incursion area, the [[304th Division (Vietnam)|304th]], [[308 Division (Vietnam)|308th]] and [[320th Division (Vietnam)|320th]]. The [[2nd Division (Vietnam)|2nd Division]] had also moved up from the south to the Tchepone area and then began to move east to meet the ARVN threat. By early March, Hanoi had massed 36,000 troops in the area, outnumbering the South Vietnamese force by two-to-one.<ref name=Fulghum/>{{rp|76}}\n\nThe method chosen by PAVN to defeat the invasion was to first isolate the northern firebases by utilizing anti-aircraft artillery. The outposts would then be pounded by round-the-clock mortar, artillery, and rocket fire. Although the ARVN firebases were themselves equipped with artillery, their guns were quickly outranged by PAVN's Soviet-supplied [[122 mm howitzer 2A18 (D-30)|122mm]] and [[130 mm towed field gun M1954 (M-46)|130mm]] pieces, which simply stood off and pounded the positions at will. The defensive edge that could have been provided by the utilization of tactical B-52 bomber strikes was nullified by the close-in tactics of the PAVN.<ref name=Airwar/>{{rp|262}} Massed ground attacks, supported by artillery and armor, would then finish the job.\n\nAs early as 18 February, PAVN forces had begun attacks by fire on bases Ranger North and South.

It was evacuated on the following day. FSB 31 was the next ARVN position to fall under the hammer.

General \u0110\u1ed1ng then ordered elements of the 17th Armored Squadron to advance north from A Loui to reinforce the base.

Smoke, dust and haze precluded observation by an American forward air control (FAC) aircraft, which was flying above {{convert|4,000|ft}} to avoid anti-aircraft fire. When a U.S. Air Force [[F-4 Phantom]] jet was shot down in the area, the FAC left the area of the battle to direct a rescue effort for the downed aircraft crew, sealing the fate of the base.

General Abrams implored Thieu to reinforce the troops in Laos and that they keep disrupting the area until the beginning of the rainy season. By the time this request was made, South Vietnam possessed only one Marine brigade in its entire national reserve. Thieu responded to Abrams by requesting that U.S. forces be deployed to Laos, knowing that such an option was impossible. <ref name=Sorley/>{{rp|255}} The battle was shifting to Hanoi's advantage. Anti-aircraft fire remained devastating and the PAVN had no trouble resupplying or reinforcing their troops in the battle area. As soon as it became evident that ARVN forces had begun a withdrawal, the PAVN increased its efforts to destroy them before they could reach South Vietnam. Anti-aircraft fire was increased to halt or slow helicopter resupply or evacuation efforts, the undermanned firebases were attacked, and ARVN ground forces had to run a gauntlet of ambushes along Route 9.\n[[File:Fire Support Base Lolo being overun during Operation Lam Son 719 - 1971.jpg|thumb|right|Fire Support Base Lolo falls to PAVN forces]]\nOnly a well-disciplined and coordinated army can execute an orderly withdrawal in the face of a determined enemy and the South Vietnamese force in Laos was neither.

On 21 March, South Vietnamese Marines at FSB Delta ({{Coord|16.550|N|106.539|E|display=inline}}), south of Route 9, came under intense ground and artillery attacks. During an attempted extraction of the force, seven helicopters were shot down and another 50 were damaged, ending the evacuation attempt.<ref name=Nalty/>{{rp|269}} The Marines finally broke out of the encirclement and marched to the safety of FSB Hotel, which was then hastily abandoned.

It also abandoned 54 105mm and 28 155mm howitzers.<ref name=Nalty/>{{rp|271}} This equipment then had to be destroyed by U.S. aircraft in order to prevent its capture and reuse by the PAVN. Covering the retreat on Route 9 was the 1st Armored Brigade, which had been assigned to the ARVN Airborne Division. When informed by a prisoner that two PAVN regiments waited in ambush ahead, the commander of the brigade, Colonel Nguyen Trong Luat, notified General \u0110\u1ed1ng of the situation.

Firepower, as it turned out, was decisive, but \"it went in favor of the enemy...

The campaign was carried out by the armed forces of the [[South Vietnam|Republic of Vietnam]] (South Vietnam) between 8 February and 25 March 1971, during the [[Vietnam War]]. The United States provided logistical, aerial, and artillery support to the operation, but its ground forces were prohibited by law from entering Laotian territory. The objective of the campaign was the disruption of a possible future offensive by the [[People's Army of Vietnam]] (PAVN), whose logistical system within Laos was known as the [[Ho Chi Minh trail|Ho Chi Minh Trail]] (the Truong Son Road to [[North Vietnam]]).\n\nBy launching such a spoiling attack against PAVN's long-established logistical system, the American and South Vietnamese high commands hoped to resolve several pressing issues. A quick victory in Laos would bolster the morale and confidence of the [[Army of the Republic of Vietnam]] (ARVN), which was already high in the wake of the successful [[Cambodian Campaign]] of 1970. It would also serve as proof positive that South Vietnamese forces could defend their nation in the face of the continuing withdrawal of U.S. ground combat forces from the theater. The operation would be, therefore, a test of that policy and ARVN's capability to operate effectively by itself.\n\nBecause of the South Vietnamese need for security which precluded thorough planning, an inability by the political and military leaders of the U.S. and South Vietnam to face military realities, and poor execution, Operation ''Lam Son 719'' collapsed when faced by the determined resistance of a skillful foe. The campaign was a disaster<ref name=\"Sander\"/> for the ARVN, demonstrating deficiencies in ARVN military leaders and that the best units of the ARVN could be defeated by PAVN<ref name=Tucker>Spencer C. Tucker , p.2471</ref> and destroying the confidence that had been built up over the previous three years.\n\n==Background==\nBetween 1959 and 1970, the Ho Chi Minh Trail had become the key logistical artery for PAVN and the [[Viet Cong]] (VC), in their effort to conduct military operations to topple the U.S.-supported government of South Vietnam and create a unified nation. Running from the southwestern corner of North Vietnam through southeastern Laos and into the western portions of South Vietnam, the trail system had been the target of continuous U.S. aerial interdiction efforts that had begun in 1966. Only small-scale covert operations in support of the air campaigns had, however, been conducted on the ground inside Laos to halt the flow of men and supplies on the trail.<ref>{{cite book|last=Van Staaveren|first=Jacob|title=Interdiction in Southern Laos|publisher=Center of Air Force History|year=1993|isbn=9781410220608|url=https://media.defense.gov/2010/Sep/27/2001329814/-1/-1/0/AFD-100927-078.pdf|page=}}</ref><ref name=Nalty/><ref>{{cite book|last=Plaster|first=John|title=Secret Commandos: Behind Enemy Lines with the Elite Warriors of SOG|publisher=Simon & Schuster|year=2004|isbn=9781501183454|page=}}</ref>\n\nSince 1966, over 630,000 men, 100,000 tons of foodstuffs, 400,000 weapons, and 50,000 tons of ammunition had traveled through the maze of gravel and dirt roads, paths, and river transportation systems that crisscrossed southeastern Laos. The trail also linked up with a similar logistical system in neighboring [[Cambodia]] known as the [[Sihanouk Trail]].<ref name=Fulghum/>{{rp|65}} However, following the overthrow of Prince [[Norodom Sihanouk]] in 1970, the pro-American [[Lon Nol]] regime had denied the use of the port of [[Sihanoukville (city)|Sihanoukville]] to communist shipping. Strategically, this was an enormous blow to the North Vietnamese effort, since 70 percent of all military supplies that supported its effort in the far south had moved through the port.<ref name=Isaacs>{{cite book|last1=Isaacs|first1=Arnold|last2=Hardy|first2=Gordon|title=The Vietnam Experience Pawns of War: Cambodia and Laos|publisher=Boston Publishing Company|year=1987|isbn=9780939526246|page=[https://archive.org/details/pawnsofwarcambod00isaa/page/89 89]|url=https://archive.org/details/pawnsofwarcambod00isaa/page/89}}</ref> A further blow to the logistical system in Cambodia had come in the spring and summer of 1970, when U.S. and ARVN forces had crossed the border and attacked PAVN/VC Base Areas during the [[Cambodian Campaign]].\n\nWith the partial destruction of the North Vietnamese logistical system in Cambodia, the U.S. headquarters in [[Ho Chi Minh City|Saigon]] determined that the time was propitious for a similar campaign in Laos. If such an operation were to be carried out, the U.S. command believed, it would be best to do it quickly, while American military assets were still available in South Vietnam. Such an operation would create supply shortages that would be felt by PAVN/VC forces 12\u201318 months later, as the last U.S. troops were leaving South Vietnam and thereby give the U.S. and its ally a respite from a possible communist offensive in the northern provinces for one year, possibly even two.<ref name=Stanton>{{cite book|last=Stanton|first=Shelby|title=The Rise and Fall of an American Army: U.S. Ground Forces in Vietnam, 1963-1973|publisher=Dell|year=1985|isbn=9780891418276|page=333}}</ref>\n\nThere were increasing signs of heavy communist logistical activity in southeastern Laos, activity which heralded just such a North Vietnamese offensive.<ref name=Palmer>{{cite book|last=Palmer|first=Dave|title=Summons of the Trumpet: A History of the Vietnam War from a Military Man's Viewpoint|publisher=Presidio Press|year=1978|isbn=9780345315830|page=303}}</ref> Communist offensives usually took place near the conclusion of the Laotian dry season (from October through March) and, for PAVN logistical forces, the push to move supplies through the system came during the height of the season. One U.S. intelligence report estimated that 90 percent of PAVN materiel coming down the Ho Chi Minh Trail was being funneled into the three northernmost provinces of South Vietnam, indicating forward stockpiling in preparation for offensive action.<ref name=Nolan/>{{rp|14}} This build-up was alarming to both Washington and the American command, and prompted the perceived necessity for a spoiling attack to derail future communist objectives.<ref name=Nolan/>{{rp|15}}\n\n===Planning===\n[[File:HoCMT.png|thumb|right|250px|Map showing the Ho Chi Minh Trail]]\nOn 8 December 1970, in response to a request from the [[Joint Chiefs of Staff]], a highly secret meeting was held at the [[Military Assistance Command, Vietnam]]'s (MACV) [[Military Assistance Command, Vietnam#MACV Headquarters/DAO Compound|Saigon headquarters]] to discuss the possibility of an ARVN cross-border attack into southeastern Laos.<ref name=Prados>{{cite book|last=Prados|first=John|title=The Blood Road: The Ho Chi Minh Trail and the Vietnam War|publisher=John Wiley and Sons|year=1998|isbn=9780471254652|page=216}}</ref> According to General [[Creighton Abrams|Creighton W.

Admiral [[John S. McCain Jr]] ([[CINCPAC]]) communicated with Admiral [[Thomas Moorer]], chairman of the Joint Chiefs, that an offensive against the Ho Chi Minh Trail might compel Prince [[Souvanna Phouma]], prime minister of Laos, \"to abandon the guise of neutrality and enter the war openly.\" Although technically neutral, the Laotian government had allowed the CIA and U.S. Air Force to conduct a covert war against an indigenous guerrilla insurgency (the Pathet Lao), that was, in turn, heavily supported by regular North Vietnamese forces.<ref name=Nalty/>{{rp|247}}\n\nOn 7 January 1971 MACV was authorized to begin detailed planning for an attack against PAVN Base Areas 604 and 611. The task was given to the commander of [[XXIV Corps (United States)|XXIV Corps]], Lieutenant General [[James W. Sutherland]], who had only nine days to submit it to MACV for approval.<ref name=Nolan/>{{rp|30}} The operation would consist of four phases. During the first phase U.S. forces inside South Vietnam would seize the border approaches and conduct diversionary operations. Next would come an ARVN armored/infantry attack along [[National Road 9 (Vietnam)|Route 9]] toward the Laotian town of [[Tchepone]], the perceived nexus of Base Area 604. The village was estimated to have had about 1,500 inhabitants in 1960; five years later, half of the residents had fled due to war; Operation Lam Son 719 then destroyed the village and left it deserted.<ref>{{cite book|last=Collins|first=John|title=Military Geography for Professionals and the Public|publisher=National Defense University Press|year=1998|isbn=9781330965832|page=372}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last=Miller|first=John|title=The Co-Vans: US Marine Advisors in Vietnam|publisher=Naval Institute Press|year=2000|isbn=9781557505491|page=146}}</ref> This advance would be protected by a series of leap-frogging aerial infantry assaults to cover the northern and southern flanks of the main column. During the third phase, search and destroy operations within Base Area 604 would be carried out and finally, the South Vietnamese force would retire either back along Route 9 or through Base Area 611 and exit through the [[A Shau Valley]].<ref name=Palmer/>{{rp|304}} It was hoped that the force could remain in Laos until the rainy season was underway at the beginning of May. U.S. planners had previously estimated that such an operation would require the commitment of four U.S. divisions (60,000 men), while Saigon would only commit a force half that size.<ref name=Karnow>{{cite book|last=Karnow|first=Stanley|title=Vietnam: A History|url=https://archive.org/details/vietnamhistory00karn|url-access=registration|publisher=Viking|year=1983|isbn=9780140265477|page=[https://archive.org/details/vietnamhistory00karn/page/629 629]}}</ref>\n\nBecause of the notorious laxity of the South Vietnamese military when it came to security precautions and the uncanny ability of communist agents to uncover operational information, the planning phase lasted only a few weeks and was divided between the American and Vietnamese high commands.<ref name=Prados/>{{rp|322\u20134}} At the lower levels, it was limited to the intelligence and operational staffs of ARVN's [[I Corps (South Vietnam)|I Corps]], under Lieutenant General [[Ho\u00e0ng Xu\u00e2n L\u00e3m]], who was to command the operation, and the XXIV Corps, headed by General Sutherland. When L\u00e3m was finally briefed by MACV and the South Vietnamese Joint General Staff in Saigon, his chief of operations was forbidden to attend the meeting, even though he had helped to write the very plan under discussion.<ref name=Nalty/>{{rp|252}} At this meeting, L\u00e3m's operational area was restricted to a corridor no wider than {{convert|15|mi}} on either side of Route 9 and a penetration no deeper than Tchepone.<ref name=Palmer/>\n\nCommand, control, and coordination of the operation was going to be problematic, especially in the highly politicized South Vietnamese command structure, where the support of key political figures was of paramount importance in promotion to and retention of command positions.<ref name=Fulghum/>{{rp|57\u20138}}<ref name=Karnow/>{{rp|630}} Lieutenant General [[L\u00ea Nguy\u00ean Khang]], the [[Republic of Vietnam Marine Division|Vietnamese Marine Corps]] commander and protege of Vice President [[Nguyen Cao Ky]], whose troops were scheduled to participate in the operation, actually outranked General L\u00e3m, who had the support of President [[Nguy\u1ec5n V\u0103n Thi\u1ec7u]]. The same situation applied to Lieutenant General [[D\u01b0 Qu\u1ed1c \u0110\u1ed1ng]], commander of ARVN [[Republic of Vietnam Airborne Division|Airborne]] forces also scheduled to participate in the operation. After the incursion began, both men remained in Saigon and delegated their command authority to junior officers rather than take orders from L\u00e3m.<ref name=Nolan/>{{rp|104\u20135}} This did not bode well for the success of the operation.\n\nIndividual units did not learn about their planned participation until 17 January. The Airborne Division that was to lead the operation received no detailed plans until 2 February, less than a week before the campaign was to begin.<ref name=Fulghum/>{{rp|70}} This was of crucial importance, since many of the units, particularly the Airborne and the Marines, had worked as separate battalions and brigades and had no experience maneuvering or cooperating in adjoining areas. According to the assistant commander of the [[U.S. 101st Airborne Division]], \"Planning was rushed, handicapped by security restrictions, and conducted separately and in isolation by the Vietnamese and the Americans.\"<ref name=Fulghum/>{{rp|72}}\n\nThe U.S. portion of the operation was to bear the title ''Dewey Canyon II'', named for [[Operation Dewey Canyon]] conducted by U.S. Marines in the northwestern South Vietnam in 1969. It was hoped that the reference to the previous operation would confuse Hanoi as to the actual target of the proposed incursion. The ARVN's portion was given the title ''Lam Son 719'', after the village of Lam Son, birthplace of the legendary Vietnamese patriot [[L\u00ea L\u1ee3i]], who had defeated an invading Chinese army in 1427. The numerical designation came from the year, 1971, and the main axis of the attack, Route 9.\n\nThe decisions had been made at the highest levels and planning had been completed, but valuable time had been lost. The South Vietnamese were about to begin their largest, most complex, and most important operation of the war. The lack of time for adequate planning and preparation, as well as the absence of any real questioning about military realities and the capabilities of the ARVN were going to prove decisive.<ref name=Fulghum/>{{rp|66}} On 29 January President Nixon gave his final approval for the operation. On the following day, Operation ''Dewey Canyon II'' was under way.\n\n==Operations==\n===Dewey Canyon II===\nAny offensive planning by the U.S. was, however, limited by the passage on 29 December 1970 of the [[Cooper-Church Amendment]], which prohibited U.S. ground forces and advisors from entering Laos. ''Dewey Canyon II'' would, therefore, be conducted within territorial South Vietnam in order to reopen Route 9 all the way to the old [[Khe Sanh Combat Base]], which had been abandoned by U.S. forces in 1968. The base would be reopened and would then serve as the logistical hub and airhead of the ARVN incursion. U.S. combat engineers were tasked with clearing Route 9 and rehabilitating Khe Sanh while infantry and mechanized units secured a line of communications along the length of the road. American artillery units would support the ARVN effort within Laos from the South Vietnamese side of the border while Army logisticians coordinated the entire supply effort for the South Vietnamese. Air support for the incursion would be provided by the aircraft of the U.S. Air Force, Navy, and Marine Corps, and U.S. Army aviation units were tasked with providing complete helicopter support for the ARVN operation.<ref name=Nolan/>{{rp|31}}\n\nU.S. forces earmarked for these missions included: four battalions of the 108th Artillery Group; two battalions of the 45th Engineer Group; the 101st Airborne Division; six battalions of the 101st Aviation Group; the 1st Brigade of the [[U.S. 5th Infantry Division|5th (Mechanized) Infantry Division]] (reinforced by two mechanized, one cavalry, one tank, and one airmobile infantry battalions; and the two battalions of the 11th Infantry Brigade of the [[23rd Infantry Division (United States)|23rd Infantry Division]].<ref name=Stanton/>{{rp|334}}\n[[File:Khe Sanh reoccuppied, Operation Lam Son 719, 12 February 1971.tif|thumb|right|Helicopters and supply vehicles at Khe Sanh, 12 February 1971]]\nOn the morning of 30 January, armor/engineer elements of the 1st Brigade, 5th Infantry Division headed west on Route 9 while the brigade's infantry elements were helilifted directly into the Khe Sanh area. By 5 February, Route 9 had been secured up to the Laotian frontier.<ref name=Prados/>{{rp|330\u20131}} Simultaneously, the 101st Airborne Division began a feint into the A Shau Valley in order to draw PAVN attention away from Khe Sanh. At the combat base, poor weather, obstacles, land mines, and unexploded ordnance pushed the rehabilitation of the airstrip (estimated by U.S. engineers at four days) a week behind schedule. As a response, a completely new airstrip had to be built and the first aircraft arrived on 15 February.<ref name=Palmer/>{{rp|306}} PAVN resistance was almost nonexistent and American casualties were light; with no previous allied presence around Khe Sanh, the North Vietnamese had seen no need to maintain large forces in the area.<ref name=Nolan/>{{rp|82}} However, General Sutherland believed that the advance to Khe Sanh had been a race between American and PAVN forces, and the U.S. had won.<ref name=Nolan/>{{rp|82}}\n\nIn order to preserve the security of the upcoming South Vietnamese operation, General Abrams had imposed a rare press embargo on the reporting of troop movements, but it was to no avail. Communist and non-American news agencies released reports of the build-up and even before the lifting of the embargo on 4 February, speculation concerning the offensive was front page news in the U.S.<ref name=Fulghum/>{{rp|72}} As had been the case during the Cambodian campaign, the government of Laos was not notified in advance of the intended operation. Prime Minister Souvanna Phouma would learn of the invasion of the PAVN occupied portions of his supposedly \"neutral\" nation only after it was under way.<ref name=Karnow/>{{rp|630}}\n\n===Offensive===\nBy early 1971, North Vietnamese troop strength in the Base Area 604 area was estimated by U.S. intelligence at 22,000 men: 7,000 combat troops, 10,000 personnel in logistical and support units, and 5,000 [[Pathet Lao]], all under the command of the newly created ''70th Front''.<ref name=Fulghum/>{{rp|66}} There were differing views on what the expected reaction of PAVN to the offensive might be. General Abrams believed that unlike Cambodia, the North Vietnamese would stand and fight for the Laotian Base Areas. As early as 11 December he had reported to Admiral McCain that:\n<blockquote>strong infantry, armor, and artillery formations were in southern Laos...formidable air defenses were deployed...the mountainous, jungle-covered terrain was an added liability. Natural clearings for helicopter landing zones were scarce and likely to be heavily defended. The bulk of the enemy's combat units were in the vicinity of Tchepone and PAVN could be expected to defend his base areas and logistics centers against any allied operation.<ref name=Sorley/>{{rp|235-6}}</blockquote>\nA prescient [[CIA]] study released in December 1970 echoed Abrams' concerns and was supported by a 21 January memorandum which \"was remarkably accurate with respect to the nature, pattern, and all-out intensity of [PAVN] reactions.\"<ref name=Prados/>{{rp|321}}\n\nMACV intelligence, on the other hand was convinced that the incursion would be only lightly opposed. Tactical air strikes and artillery preparations would neutralize the estimated 170 to 200 anti-aircraft artillery weapons believed to be in the area, and the threat posed by PAVN armored units was considered minimal. North Vietnamese reinforcement capability was set at 14 days by two divisions north of the [[Vietnamese Demilitarized Zone|DMZ]], and it was hoped that diversionary operations would occupy them for the duration of the operation.<ref name=Fulghum/>{{rp|72}} Unfortunately, when North Vietnamese reinforcements did arrive, they did not come from the north as expected, but from Base Area 611 and the A Shau Valley to the south, where eight regiments, all supported by organic artillery units, were within two weeks marching range.\n\nThe North Vietnamese were expecting some sort of operation as early as 26 January when the text of an intercepted radio message read \"It has been determined that the enemy may strike into our cargo carrier system in order to cut it off...Prepare to mobilize and strike the enemy hard. Be vigilant.\"<ref name=Sorley/>{{rp|241}}\n\nThe tactical air strikes that were to precede the incursion and suppress known anti-aircraft positions were suspended two days prior to the operation due to poor flying weather. After a massive preliminary artillery bombardment and 11 [[B-52 Stratofortress]] missions, the incursion began on 8 February, when a 4,000-man ARVN armor/infantry task force consisting of the 3rd Armored Brigade and the 1st and 8th Airborne Battalions, advanced west unopposed along Route 9. To cover the northern flank, ARVN Airborne and Ranger elements were deployed to the north of the main advance. The 39th Ranger Battalion was helilifted into a Landing Zone (LZ) known as Ranger North ({{Coord|16.744|N|106.493|E|display=inline}}) while the 21st Ranger Battalion moved into Ranger South ({{Coord|16.736|N|106.472|E|display=inline}}). These outposts were to serve as tripwires for any communist advance into the zone of the ARVN incursion. Meanwhile, the 2nd Airborne Battalion occupied Fire Support Base (FSB) 30 ({{Coord|16.696|N|106.486|E|display=inline}}) while the 3rd Airborne Brigade Headquarters and the 3rd Airborne Battalion went into FSB 31 ({{Coord|16.715|N|106.426|E|display=inline}}).

Almost immediately, supporting helicopters began to take fire from the heights, which allowed PAVN gunners to fire down on the aircraft from pre-registered machine gun and mortar positions. Making matters worse for the advance, Route 9 was in poor condition, so poor in fact that only tracked vehicles and jeeps could make the westward journey. This threw the burden of reinforcement and resupply onto the aviation assets. The helicopter units then became the essential mode of logistical support, a role that was made increasingly more dangerous due to low cloud cover and incessant anti-aircraft fire.<ref name=Airwar>{{cite book|last=Nalty|first=Bernard C.

By 11 February A Luoi had become the central fire base and command center for the operation. The plan then called for a quick ground thrust to secure the main objective, but South Vietnamese forces had stalled at A Loui while awaiting orders to proceed from General L\u00e3m.<ref name=Hinh/>{{rp|38}} Two days later, Generals Abrams and Sutherland flew to Lam's forward command post at [[\u0110\u00f4ng H\u00e0 Combat Base|\u0110\u00f4ng H\u00e0]] in order to speed up the timetable. At the meeting of the generals, it was instead decided to extend the 1st Division's line of outposts south of Route 9 westward to cover the projected advance. This would take an additional five days.<ref name=Hinh/>{{rp|43}}\n\nBack in Washington, [[Secretary of Defense]] [[Melvin Laird]] and the Joint Chiefs tried to refute claims by reporters that the South Vietnamese advance had stalled. At a press conference, Laird claimed that the halt at A Luoi was simply a \"pause\" that was giving ARVN commanders a chance to \"watch and assess enemy movements...The operation is going according to plan.\"<ref>\"Indochina: Tough Times on the Trail\"', ''Time Magazine'', 8 March 1971.</ref>\n\n==Response==\n===Counteroffensive===\nThe North Vietnamese response to the incursion was gradual. Hanoi's attention was riveted on another diversionary maneuver being conducted by a U.S. naval task force off the coast of the North Vietnam. This force conducted all of the maneuvers necessary for the carrying out of an amphibious landing only 20 kilometers off the city of [[Vinh]].<ref name=Prados/>{{rp|338}} Hanoi's preoccupation with a possible invasion did not last long. Its B-70 Corps commanded three divisions in the incursion area, the [[304th Division (Vietnam)|304th]], [[308 Division (Vietnam)|308th]] and [[320th Division (Vietnam)|320th]]. The [[2nd Division (Vietnam)|2nd Division]] had also moved up from the south to the Tchepone area and then began to move east to meet the ARVN threat. By early March, Hanoi had massed 36,000 troops in the area, outnumbering the South Vietnamese force by two-to-one.<ref name=Fulghum/>{{rp|76}}\n\nThe method chosen by PAVN to defeat the invasion was to first isolate the northern firebases by utilizing anti-aircraft artillery. The outposts would then be pounded by round-the-clock mortar, artillery, and rocket fire. Although the ARVN firebases were themselves equipped with artillery, their guns were quickly outranged by PAVN's Soviet-supplied [[122 mm howitzer 2A18 (D-30)|122mm]] and [[130 mm towed field gun M1954 (M-46)|130mm]] pieces, which simply stood off and pounded the positions at will. The defensive edge that could have been provided by the utilization of tactical B-52 bomber strikes was nullified by the close-in tactics of the PAVN.<ref name=Airwar/>{{rp|262}} Massed ground attacks, supported by artillery and armor, would then finish the job.\n\nAs early as 18 February, PAVN forces had begun attacks by fire on bases Ranger North and South. A UH-1H medevac helicopter from the 237th Medical Detachment was hit by PAVN fire and crash-landed at Ranger North: two of its crew were rescued by another helicopter while the crew chief Sp4c.

Another casualty of the battle, although an indirect one, was South Vietnamese General [[\u0110\u1ed7 Cao Tr\u00ed]], commander of [[III Corps (South Vietnam)|III Corps]] and hero of the Cambodian campaign. Ordered by President Thieu to take over for the outclassed L\u00e3m, Tr\u00ed died in a helicopter crash on 23 February while en route to his new command.\n\nThat same day FSB Hotel 2 ({{Coord|16.472|N|106.585|E|display=inline}}), south of Route 9, also came under an intense artillery/infantry attack. It was evacuated on the following day. FSB 31 was the next ARVN position to fall under the hammer. Airborne Division commander General \u0110\u1ed1ng had opposed stationing his elite paratroopers in static defensive positions and felt that his men's usual aggressiveness had been stifled.<ref name=Fulghum/>{{rp|82}} Vicious PAVN anti-aircraft fire made reinforcement and resupply of the firebase impossible. General \u0110\u1ed1ng then ordered elements of the 17th Armored Squadron to advance north from A Loui to reinforce the base. The armored force never arrived, due to conflicting orders from Generals L\u00e3m and \u0110\u1ed1ng that halted the armored advance several kilometers south of FSB 31.<ref name=Nolan/>{{rp|144\u20135}}\n\nOn 25 February the PAVN deluged the base with artillery fire and then launched a conventional armored/infantry assault. Smoke, dust and haze precluded observation by an American forward air control (FAC) aircraft, which was flying above {{convert|4,000|ft}} to avoid anti-aircraft fire. When a U.S. Air Force [[F-4 Phantom]] jet was shot down in the area, the FAC left the area of the battle to direct a rescue effort for the downed aircraft crew, sealing the fate of the base.

General Abrams implored Thieu to reinforce the troops in Laos and that they keep disrupting the area until the beginning of the rainy season. By the time this request was made, South Vietnam possessed only one Marine brigade in its entire national reserve. Thieu responded to Abrams by requesting that U.S. forces be deployed to Laos, knowing that such an option was impossible. <ref name=Sorley/>{{rp|255}} The battle was shifting to Hanoi's advantage. Anti-aircraft fire remained devastating and the PAVN had no trouble resupplying or reinforcing their troops in the battle area. As soon as it became evident that ARVN forces had begun a withdrawal, the PAVN increased its efforts to destroy them before they could reach South Vietnam. Anti-aircraft fire was increased to halt or slow helicopter resupply or evacuation efforts, the undermanned firebases were attacked, and ARVN ground forces had to run a gauntlet of ambushes along Route 9.\n[[File:Fire Support Base Lolo being overun during Operation Lam Son 719 - 1971.jpg|thumb|right|Fire Support Base Lolo falls to PAVN forces]]\nOnly a well-disciplined and coordinated army can execute an orderly withdrawal in the face of a determined enemy and the South Vietnamese force in Laos was neither.

It also abandoned 54 105mm and 28 155mm howitzers.<ref name=Nalty/>{{rp|271}} This equipment then had to be destroyed by U.S. aircraft in order to prevent its capture and reuse by the PAVN. Covering the retreat on Route 9 was the 1st Armored Brigade, which had been assigned to the ARVN Airborne Division. When informed by a prisoner that two PAVN regiments waited in ambush ahead, the commander of the brigade, Colonel Nguyen Trong Luat, notified General \u0110\u1ed1ng of the situation.

The military expansion of the Ho Chi Minh Trail to the west which had begun in 1970 at the expense of Laotian forces, was quickly accelerated. Laotian troops were soon withdrawing toward the [[Mekong River]] and a logistical artery {{convert|60|mi}} in width was soon expanded to {{convert|90|mi}}. Another result of the operation was a firm decision by the Politburo to launch a major conventional invasion of South Vietnam in early 1972, paving the way for the ''Nguy\u1ec5n Hu\u1ec7 Offensive'', known in the west as the [[Easter Offensive]].<ref name=Davidson/>{{rp|699}}\n\nDuring ''Lam Son 719'', the U.S. planners had believed that any North Vietnamese forces that opposed the incursion would be caught in the open and decimated by the application of American aerial might, either in the form of tactical airstrikes or airmobility, which would provide ARVN troops with superior battlefield maneuvering capability. Firepower, as it turned out, was decisive, but \"it went in favor of the enemy...

The 101st Airborne Division alone, for example, had 84 of its aircraft destroyed and another 430 damaged. During ''Lam Son 719'' American helicopters had flown more than 160,000 sorties and 19 U.S. Army aviators had been killed, 59 were wounded, and 11 were missing at its conclusion.<ref name=Nalty/>{{rp|273}} South Vietnamese helicopters had flown an additional 5,500 missions.

Boss battles are generally seen at a climax of a particular section of the game, usually at the end of a [[level (video gaming)|level or stage]], or guarding a specific objective; the boss enemy is generally far stronger than the opponents the [[player (game)|player]] has faced up to that point and is usually faced solo. A [[#Miniboss|'''miniboss''']] is a boss weaker or less significant than the main boss in the same area or level, though more powerful than the standard enemies and often fought alongside them. A '''[[#Superboss|superboss]]''' (sometimes 'secret' or 'hidden' boss) is generally much more powerful than the bosses encountered as part of the main game's plot and often an optional encounter. A '''[[#Final boss|final boss]]''' is often the main [[antagonist]] of a game's story and the defeat of that character provides a positive conclusion to the game.\n\nFor example, in a [[Run and gun game|run 'n' gun]] video game all regular enemies might use pistols while the boss uses a machine gun. A boss enemy is quite often larger in size than other enemies and the [[player character]].<ref>{{Cite web |last=Schroder|first=Ben |url=http://www.gamesradar.com/the-top-7big-bosses/ |title=The Top 7...

Bosses take strategy and special knowledge to defeat, such as how to attack weak points or avoid specific attacks.\n\nBosses are common in many genres of video games, but they are especially common in story-driven titles. [[Role-playing video game|RPGs]], [[FPS game|FPSs]], [[Platform game|platform games]], [[Fighting game|fighting games]] and [[shoot'em ups]] are particularly associated with boss battles. They may be less common in [[puzzle games]], card video games, [[Sports game|sports games]], and [[simulation games]].

As such, they are usually characterized by unique music and [[cutscene]]s before and after the boss battle. Recurring bosses and final bosses may have their own specific [[theme music]] to distinguish them from other boss battles. This concept extends beyond combat-oriented video games. For example, a number of titles in the ''[[Dance Dance Revolution (series)|Dance Dance Revolution]]'' [[rhythm game]] series contain \"boss songs\" that are called \"bosses\" because they are exceptionally difficult to perform on.<ref>{{cite web|last=Dodson|first= Joe |date=15 October 2007 |url=https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/dance-dance-revolution-supernova-2-review/1900-6181073/|title=Dance Dance Revolution: SuperNOVA 2 Review|website=[[GameSpot]]|access-date=2019-03-05}}</ref>\n\n==Specific boss types==\n\n===Miniboss===\n[[File:Broforce_miniboss_animated.gif|thumb|right|Miniboss in the 2015 video game ''[[Broforce]]'', a [[Run-and-gun platform game|run-and-gun platformer]]]]\n<!--Please do not list every single miniboss for every single video game series in this section, notable or not.-->\nA miniboss, also known as a \"middle boss\", \"mid-boss\", \"half-boss\", \"sub-boss\",<ref>{{cite magazine |title=The Next Generation 1996 Lexicon A to Z: Sub-boss|magazine=Next Generation|issue=15 |publisher=Imagine Media|date=March 1996|page=41}}</ref> or \"semi-boss\", is a boss weaker or less significant than the main boss in the same area or level. Some minibosses are stronger versions of regular enemies, as in the [[Kirby (series)|''Kirby'']] games.{{citation needed|date=July 2018}} Other video game characters who usually take the role of a miniboss are the [[Koopalings]] (''[[Super Mario]]'' series), Vile (''[[Mega Man X]]'' series), Allen O'Neil ([[Metal Slug (series)|''Metal Slug'']]), and Dark Link (''[[The Legend of Zelda]]'' series, though he appears as a final boss in ''[[Zelda II: The Adventure of Link]]''). There is also a subtype nicknamed the \"Wolfpack Boss\", for its similarity to a pack of [[wolves]], often consisting of a group of strong normal enemies that are easy to defeat on their own, but a group of them can be as difficult as a boss battle.\n\n=== Superboss ===\nA superboss is a type of boss most commonly found in [[Role-playing video game|role-playing video games]]. They are considered optional enemies, though optional bosses are not all superbosses and do not have to be defeated to complete the game. They are generally much more powerful than the bosses encountered as part of the main game's plot or [[quest (gaming)|quest]], more difficult even than the final boss, and often the player is required to complete a sidequest or the entire game to fight the superboss. For example, in ''[[Final Fantasy VII]]'', the player may choose to seek out and fight the Ruby and Emerald Weapons. Some superbosses will take the place of the final boss if certain requirements are met. This is common in [[fighting game]]s such as [[Akuma (Street Fighter)|Akuma]] in ''[[Super Street Fighter II Turbo]]''. Some superbosses can also yield special [[item (gaming)|items]] or skills that cannot be found any other way that can give a player a significant advantage during playthrough of the rest of the game, such as added experience or an extremely powerful weapon. For example, the \"raid bosses\" from ''[[Borderlands 2]]'' give rare loot unavailable anywhere else. Some superbosses in [[Online game|online games]] have an immense amount of health and must be defeated within a [[time limit (video gaming)|time limit]] by having [[Raid (gaming)|a large number of players or parties working together to defeat the boss]]. Examples of such superbosses can be found in games like ''[[Shadow Fight 2]]'' and ''[[Star Wars: Galaxy of Heroes]]''. [[Toby Fox]]'s games ''[[Undertale]]'' and ''[[Deltarune]]'' both feature superbosses in the form of Sans the Skeleton (only accessible by making it to the end of ''Undertale'''s \"Genocide Route\") and Jevil (only accessible by locating a set of keys to free him from a prison cell), respectively.\n\n===Final boss===\n<!--Please do not list every single final boss for every single video game series in this section, notable or not.-->\n\nThe final boss, or end boss,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.engadget.com/2012/06/13/know-your-lore-the-true-end-boss-of-mists-of-pandaria/|title=Know Your Lore: The true end boss of Mists of Pandaria?|last=Rossi|first=Matthew|date=13 June 2012|website=[[Engadget]]|access-date=20 June 2019}}</ref> is typically present at, or near, the end of a game, with completion of the game's storyline usually following victory in the battle.{{r|scorpia199408}}<ref name=\"kaiser20100713\">{{Cite web |url=http://www.escapistmagazine.com/articles/view/video-games/issues/issue_262/7811-Stop-Killing-the-Foozle |title=Stop Killing the Foozle! |last=Kaiser |first=Rowan |date=13 July 2010 |work=[[The Escapist (magazine)|The Escapist]] |access-date=2017-12-20 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171222053323/http://www.escapistmagazine.com/articles/view/video-games/issues/issue_262/7811-Stop-Killing-the-Foozle |archive-date=22 December 2017}}</ref> The final boss is usually the main antagonist of the game; however, there are exceptions, such as in ''[[Conker's Bad Fur Day]]'', where the final boss is the antagonist's alien pet. Final bosses are generally larger, more detailed, and better animated than lesser enemies, often in order to inspire a feeling of grandeur and special significance from the encounter.{{citation needed|date=July 2018}}\n\nIn some games, a hidden boss, referred to as the \"true\" final boss, is present. These bosses only appear after the completion of specific additional levels, choosing specific dialogue options, or after obtaining a particular item or set of items, such as the Chaos Emeralds in the ''[[Sonic the Hedgehog]]'' series, or doing a series of tasks in ''[[Metal Gear Solid: Peace Walker]]''. These bosses are generally more difficult to defeat. In games with a \"true\" final boss, victory leads to either a better ending or a more detailed version of the regular ending.

A boss enemy is quite often larger in size than other enemies and the [[player character]].<ref>{{Cite web |last=Schroder|first=Ben |url=http://www.gamesradar.com/the-top-7big-bosses/ |title=The Top 7...

Bosses take strategy and special knowledge to defeat, such as how to attack weak points or avoid specific attacks.\n\nBosses are common in many genres of video games, but they are especially common in story-driven titles. [[Role-playing video game|RPGs]], [[FPS game|FPSs]], [[Platform game|platform games]], [[Fighting game|fighting games]] and [[shoot'em ups]] are particularly associated with boss battles. They may be less common in [[puzzle games]], card video games, [[Sports game|sports games]], and [[simulation games]]. The first game to feature a boss fight was the 1975 RPG [[Dnd (video game)|dnd]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.polygon.com/features/2015/9/28/9333685/annotated-history-boss-battles|title=An annotated history of video game boss battles|last=Lee|first=Tyler|date=2015-09-28|website=Polygon|language=en|access-date=2019-11-25}}</ref> The concept has expanded to new genres, like [[Rhythm game|rhythm games]], where there may be a \"boss song\" that is more difficult.

As such, they are usually characterized by unique music and [[cutscene]]s before and after the boss battle. Recurring bosses and final bosses may have their own specific [[theme music]] to distinguish them from other boss battles. This concept extends beyond combat-oriented video games. For example, a number of titles in the ''[[Dance Dance Revolution (series)|Dance Dance Revolution]]'' [[rhythm game]] series contain \"boss songs\" that are called \"bosses\" because they are exceptionally difficult to perform on.<ref>{{cite web|last=Dodson|first= Joe |date=15 October 2007 |url=https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/dance-dance-revolution-supernova-2-review/1900-6181073/|title=Dance Dance Revolution: SuperNOVA 2 Review|website=[[GameSpot]]|access-date=2019-03-05}}</ref>\n\n==Specific boss types==\n\n===Miniboss===\n[[File:Broforce_miniboss_animated.gif|thumb|right|Miniboss in the 2015 video game ''[[Broforce]]'', a [[Run-and-gun platform game|run-and-gun platformer]]]]\n<!--Please do not list every single miniboss for every single video game series in this section, notable or not.-->\nA miniboss, also known as a \"middle boss\", \"mid-boss\", \"half-boss\", \"sub-boss\",<ref>{{cite magazine |title=The Next Generation 1996 Lexicon A to Z: Sub-boss|magazine=Next Generation|issue=15 |publisher=Imagine Media|date=March 1996|page=41}}</ref> or \"semi-boss\", is a boss weaker or less significant than the main boss in the same area or level. Some minibosses are stronger versions of regular enemies, as in the [[Kirby (series)|''Kirby'']] games.{{citation needed|date=July 2018}} Other video game characters who usually take the role of a miniboss are the [[Koopalings]] (''[[Super Mario]]'' series), Vile (''[[Mega Man X]]'' series), Allen O'Neil ([[Metal Slug (series)|''Metal Slug'']]), and Dark Link (''[[The Legend of Zelda]]'' series, though he appears as a final boss in ''[[Zelda II: The Adventure of Link]]''). There is also a subtype nicknamed the \"Wolfpack Boss\", for its similarity to a pack of [[wolves]], often consisting of a group of strong normal enemies that are easy to defeat on their own, but a group of them can be as difficult as a boss battle.\n\n=== Superboss ===\nA superboss is a type of boss most commonly found in [[Role-playing video game|role-playing video games]]. They are considered optional enemies, though optional bosses are not all superbosses and do not have to be defeated to complete the game. They are generally much more powerful than the bosses encountered as part of the main game's plot or [[quest (gaming)|quest]], more difficult even than the final boss, and often the player is required to complete a sidequest or the entire game to fight the superboss. For example, in ''[[Final Fantasy VII]]'', the player may choose to seek out and fight the Ruby and Emerald Weapons. Some superbosses will take the place of the final boss if certain requirements are met. This is common in [[fighting game]]s such as [[Akuma (Street Fighter)|Akuma]] in ''[[Super Street Fighter II Turbo]]''. Some superbosses can also yield special [[item (gaming)|items]] or skills that cannot be found any other way that can give a player a significant advantage during playthrough of the rest of the game, such as added experience or an extremely powerful weapon. For example, the \"raid bosses\" from ''[[Borderlands 2]]'' give rare loot unavailable anywhere else. Some superbosses in [[Online game|online games]] have an immense amount of health and must be defeated within a [[time limit (video gaming)|time limit]] by having [[Raid (gaming)|a large number of players or parties working together to defeat the boss]]. Examples of such superbosses can be found in games like ''[[Shadow Fight 2]]'' and ''[[Star Wars: Galaxy of Heroes]]''. [[Toby Fox]]'s games ''[[Undertale]]'' and ''[[Deltarune]]'' both feature superbosses in the form of Sans the Skeleton (only accessible by making it to the end of ''Undertale'''s \"Genocide Route\") and Jevil (only accessible by locating a set of keys to free him from a prison cell), respectively.\n\n===Final boss===\n<!--Please do not list every single final boss for every single video game series in this section, notable or not.-->\n\nThe final boss, or end boss,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.engadget.com/2012/06/13/know-your-lore-the-true-end-boss-of-mists-of-pandaria/|title=Know Your Lore: The true end boss of Mists of Pandaria?|last=Rossi|first=Matthew|date=13 June 2012|website=[[Engadget]]|access-date=20 June 2019}}</ref> is typically present at, or near, the end of a game, with completion of the game's storyline usually following victory in the battle.{{r|scorpia199408}}<ref name=\"kaiser20100713\">{{Cite web |url=http://www.escapistmagazine.com/articles/view/video-games/issues/issue_262/7811-Stop-Killing-the-Foozle |title=Stop Killing the Foozle! |last=Kaiser |first=Rowan |date=13 July 2010 |work=[[The Escapist (magazine)|The Escapist]] |access-date=2017-12-20 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171222053323/http://www.escapistmagazine.com/articles/view/video-games/issues/issue_262/7811-Stop-Killing-the-Foozle |archive-date=22 December 2017}}</ref> The final boss is usually the main antagonist of the game; however, there are exceptions, such as in ''[[Conker's Bad Fur Day]]'', where the final boss is the antagonist's alien pet. Final bosses are generally larger, more detailed, and better animated than lesser enemies, often in order to inspire a feeling of grandeur and special significance from the encounter.{{citation needed|date=July 2018}}\n\nIn some games, a hidden boss, referred to as the \"true\" final boss, is present. These bosses only appear after the completion of specific additional levels, choosing specific dialogue options, or after obtaining a particular item or set of items, such as the Chaos Emeralds in the ''[[Sonic the Hedgehog]]'' series, or doing a series of tasks in ''[[Metal Gear Solid: Peace Walker]]''. These bosses are generally more difficult to defeat. In games with a \"true\" final boss, victory leads to either a better ending or a more detailed version of the regular ending.
