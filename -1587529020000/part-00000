Based on the original design, Soto's version distorts and abstracts the seal as a means to critique its representation of Puerto Rican culture.<ref>{{cite web|title=Jorge Soto-S\u00e1nchez|url=http://ahajorgesotosanchez.blogspot.com/|publisher=Association of Hispanic Arts|accessdate=5/9/2011|date=11 April 2009}}</ref>\n\n==Background==\n\n===Jorge Soto===\n\nJorge Soto (b. 1947- d.1987) was a [[Nuyorican]] artist born El Barrio, New York. In his early years he turned to art as a means to deal with the trauma of growing up in the poverty and violence of the inner city, a theme that would inform his reinterpretation of the seal. In 1971 he began working with the collaborators of the Taller Boricua artists' workshop, whose art reflected an ideological re-evisioning of the \u201croots\u201d of Puerto Rican culture and attempted to reconcile this with the experiences of the Puerto Rican diaspora. This was referred to as \u201cAfro-Ta\u00edno consciousness\u201d and was the basis for Soto's recreation of the seal.\n\n===Original seal===\n\nThe original seal of the [[Institute of Puerto Rican Culture]], or ICP, was commissioned by the institute's director, Ricardo Alegr\u00eda, in 1955, and designed by Lorenzo Homar, a well-known Puerto Rican visual artist at the time. The design depicted three figures: a Spanish caballero or knight standing in the center carrying a book, a male Ta\u00edno Indian to his left bearing a stone carving, and an African man to his right holding a drum. The seal's representation of Puerto Rican culture has been the subject of critique since its adoption by the ICP for its overemphasis of the importance of European culture to Puerto Rico and its lack of female representation.\n\n==Soto's version==\n\nIn Soto's version of the seal, all three of the figures of the original are present, but are stripped of their clothing and distorted in various ways. The Spanish caballero is represented by a skeleton wearing a conquistador's helmet while holding a skull wearing Uncle Sam's hat \u2013 an acknowledgement of the two major colonizing forces that have played important roles in the island's history and culture.\n\nThe Ta\u00edno Indian of the original is represented as a \u201cvoluptuous\u201d and \u201cfecund\u201d hermaphroditic figure with large thighs and a spiral detail over its abdomen suggesting a womb. Its birdlike head is shown merging with a representation of \u201cYoka Hu,\u201d the Ta\u00edno god of life force, who stands in contrast of the Spanish/U.S. symbolism of death. This has also been interpreted by scholar [[Juan Flores (professor)|Juan Flores]] as a critique of the colonial gender system and the patriarchal quality of the dominant narrative of Puerto Rican history, something that is reflected in the original seal's lack of any feminine symbolism.\n\nThe African figure is depicted carrying a skull wearing a conquistador's helmet in one hand and a rapier in the other. This element in particular has led to diverging interpretations. Flores suggests the rapier is the weapon with which the African has beheaded the conquistador, but his view is contested by '''Yasm\u00edn Ram\u00edrez''' of the Taller Boricua Center. Ram\u00edrez instead suggests that the rapier should be interpreted as a reference to the rituals of syncretic Afro-Caribbean religions such as [[Candombl\u00e9]] and [[Santer\u00eda]], in which they serve to beat drums. The drum's replacement by the skull, she argues, can then be understood as having the power to \"connect individuals to the minds of their ancestors\". Furthermore, the figure's face is split in two, something that she interprets as a reference to the Yoruba and Kongo cultures, both of which were brought to Puerto Rico under the slave trade.<ref>{{cite book|last=Flores|first=Juan|title=The diaspora strikes back|year=2009|publisher=Taylor & Francis|location=United States|isbn=9780415952606|pages=237}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last=Ram\u00edrez|first=Yasmin|title=Nuyorican Visionary: Jorge Soto and the Evolution of an Afro-Ta\u00edno Aesthetic at Taller Boricua|journal=Centro Journal|year=2005|volume=XVII|issue=002|url=https://www.redalyc.org/pdf/377/37717203.pdf}}</ref>\n\n==References==\n<references />\n\n[[Category:Puerto Rican culture]]\n", "text_old": "{{short description|Artwork created by Nuyorican artist Jorge Soto}}\n{{Orphan|date=April 2014}}\n\n'''The Seal of the Institute of Puerto Rican Culture (Jorge Soto Version)''' is an artwork created circa 1975 by [[Nuyorican]] artist '''Jorge Soto.'''

His best friend, Suni ([[Sunny Wayne]]), joins him and refuses to return even though Kasi informs him that he himself is not sure of the destination. They travel to Orissa via [[Bangalore]] and [[Vizag]] where they are attacked by bandits. However, a group of riders rescue them and Kasi and Suni join them on their journey to [[Puri]] to attend a surfing festival.\n\nWhile in Puri, Kasi meets Ishita (Paloma Monappa), a surfer. She develops an attraction towards Kasi and shares her feelings. Kasi tells her that he was in love with Assi ([[Bala Hijam|Surja Bala Hijam]]), a girl from [[Nagaland]]. Nagaland is a place of political unrest and her parents were killed during the fights. Kasi takes her home to get his parents' approval to get married. However, his mom tells him of her displeasure as she does not share their culture or religion. Though his father was more supportive, he too disapproves their relationship fearing the family's social status. It is revealed that Kasi is on his way to Nagaland to win her back.\n\nFrom Puri, they head to [[Kolkata]]. However, on the way, they are mistaken for bandits in a village. When they inform him that they are from [[Kerala]], the village chief reminisces about his life as a Communist and welcomes them to stay. In the village, they help to build a machine that grinds wheat. Suni falls in love with the chief's daughter, Gouri ([[Ena Saha]]).\n\nBeyond Kolkata, they ride further east when an unidentified truck tries to injure Suni. When their bikes get punctured, they take it to a shop which happened to be owned by a [[Malayalee]]. He reveals that he had run away from the state years ago for committing a political murder. He informs that years later he has forgotten the ideals of the party and that he yearns to go back. Kasi remembers the time in college when one of his friends was murdered by some goons due to some scuffle.\n\nWhen they reach [[Assam]], they end up in the middle of a communal riot where they rescue a little girl. Kasi begins to regret the road trip and calls his parents to inform them that he is coming back. With a new outlook on life after meeting different people and visiting different places, he decides against going back and continues the journey. As they near their destination, Suni turns back to go to Gouri and the two friends separate.\n\nKasi reaches Nagaland and searches for Assi. The presence of a stranger attracts the attention of local militants and they plan to attack Assi that night. Kasi meets Assi and they get back together. At night when the militants arrive at Assi's house, they find the two missing. The film ends with Kasi and Assi riding away at dawn to Tawang.\n\n==Cast==\n{{colbegin}}\n* [[Dulquer Salmaan]] as Kasim aka Kaasii\n* [[Sunny Wayne]] as Sunil Lekshmi aka Suni\n* [[Bala Hijam|Surja Bala Hijam]] as Assi\n* [[Shaun Romy]] as Assi's friend <ref>{https://www.indiaglitz.com/kammatipaadam-is-not-my-first-with-dulquer-shaun-romy-malayalam-news-161004</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/entertainment/malayalam/movies/news/Dulquer-to-romance-Shaun-Romy/articleshow/50931726.cms|title=Dulquer to romance Shaun Romy - Times of India|publisher=}}</ref>\n* [[Ena Saha]] as Gouri\n*[[Abhija Sivakala]] as Paru\n* [[Shane Nigam]] as Shyam\n* [[Joy Mathew]] as Abdul Haji\n* [[Dhritiman Chatterjee]] as Bimalda\n* [[Vanitha Krishnachandran]] as Azma\n* Paloma Monappa as Ishita\n* [[Avantika Mohan]] as Fatima\n* [[Anikha|Baby Anikha]] as WafaMol\n* Ajay Nataraj\n* Master Reinhard Abernathy as Balu\n* Surjith as Raghavan\n* K.

His best friend, Suni ([[Sunny Wayne]]), joins him and refuses to return even though Kasi informs him that he himself is not sure of the destination. They travel to Orissa via [[Bangalore]] and [[Vizag]] where they are attacked by bandits. However, a group of riders rescue them and Kasi and Suni join them on their journey to [[Puri]] to attend a surfing festival.\n\nWhile in Puri, Kasi meets Ishita (Paloma Monappa), a surfer. She develops an attraction towards Kasi and shares her feelings. Kasi tells her that he was in love with Assi ([[Bala Hijam|Surja Bala Hijam]]), a girl from [[Nagaland]]. Nagaland is a place of political unrest and her parents were killed during the fights. Kasi takes her home to get his parents' approval to get married. However, his mom tells him of her displeasure as she does not share their culture or religion. Though his father was more supportive, he too disapproves their relationship fearing the family's social status. It is revealed that Kasi is on his way to Nagaland to win her back.\n\nFrom Puri, they head to [[Kolkata]]. However, on the way, they are mistaken for bandits in a village. When they inform him that they are from [[Kerala]], the village chief reminisces about his life as a Communist and welcomes them to stay. In the village, they help to build a machine that grinds wheat. Suni falls in love with the chief's daughter, Gouri ([[Ena Saha]]).\n\nBeyond Kolkata, they ride further east when an unidentified truck tries to injure Suni. When their bikes get punctured, they take it to a shop which happened to be owned by a [[Malayalee]]. He reveals that he had run away from the state years ago for committing a political murder. He informs that years later he has forgotten the ideals of the party and that he yearns to go back. Kasi remembers the time in college when one of his friends was murdered by some goons due to some scuffle.\n\nWhen they reach [[Assam]], they end up in the middle of a communal riot where they rescue a little girl. Kasi begins to regret the road trip and calls his parents to inform them that he is coming back. With a new outlook on life after meeting different people and visiting different places, he decides against going back and continues the journey. As they near their destination, Suni turns back to go to Gouri and the two friends separate.\n\nKasi reaches Nagaland and searches for Assi. The presence of a stranger attracts the attention of local militants and they plan to attack Assi that night. Kasi meets Assi and they get back together. At night when the militants arrive at Assi's house, they find the two missing. The film ends with Kasi and Assi riding away at dawn to Tawang.\n\n==Cast==\n{{colbegin}}\n* [[Dulquer Salmaan]] as Kasim aka Kaasii\n* [[Sunny Wayne]] as Sunil Lekshmi aka Suni\n* [[Bala Hijam|Surja Bala Hijam]] as Assi\n* [[Shaun Romy]] as Assi's friend <ref>{https://www.indiaglitz.com/kammatipaadam-is-not-my-first-with-dulquer-shaun-romy-malayalam-news-161004</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/entertainment/malayalam/movies/news/Dulquer-to-romance-Shaun-Romy/articleshow/50931726.cms|title=Dulquer to romance Shaun Romy - Times of India|publisher=}}</ref>\n* [[Ena Saha]] as Gouri\n*[[Abhija Sivakala]] as Paru\n* [[Shane Nigam]] as Shyam\n* [[Joy Mathew]] as Abdul Haji\n* [[Dhritiman Chatterjee]] as Bimalda\n* [[Vanitha Krishnachandran]] as Azma\n* Paloma Monappa as Ishita\n* [[Avantika Mohan]] as Fatima\n* [[Anikha|Baby Anikha]] as WafaMol\n* Ajay Nataraj\n* Master Reinhard Abernathy as Balu\n* Surjith as Raghavan\n* K.

The reason given by Jones to commit suicide was consistent with his previously stated conspiracy theories of intelligence organizations allegedly conspiring against the Temple, that men would \"parachute in here on us,\" \"shoot some of our innocent babies\" and \"they'll torture our children, they'll torture some of our people here, they'll torture our seniors.\" Jones's prior statements that hostile forces would convert captured children to [[fascism]] would lead many members who held strong opposing views to fascism to view the suicide as valid. <ref name=\"tape\" />\n\nWith that reasoning, Jones and several members argued that the group should commit \"revolutionary suicide\" by drinking [[cyanide]]-laced grape-flavored [[Flavor Aid]]. Later-released Temple films show Jones opening a storage container full of [[Kool Aid]] in large quantities.

{"title_page": "Palladium Ballroom", "text_new": "{{more footnotes|date=October 2012}}\n\n:''For the later Downtown Club, see [[Palladium (New York City)]]''\n\n[[File:The Palladium Ballroom.gif|thumb|right|300px|Palladium Ballroom]]\n\nThe '''Palladium Ballroom''' was located at the northeast corner of [[53rd Street (Manhattan)|53rd Street]] and opened on Thursday, March 15, 1946.<ref>''New York Post'', March 14, 1946; p. 35</ref>\n\n==Big Three==\nIn 1948, the Palladium Ballroom gained in stature because of the Big Three acts: Tito Puente, Tito Rodr\u00edguez, and Machito. The Big Three grew in popularity on the strength of their bookings at the Palladium. These bands were turning out [[Mambo (dance)|mambo]] hit after mambo hit such as \"Asia Minor\" and \"Babarabatiri\", \"Picadillo\" and \"Ran Kan Kan\", and \"Mambo Mona\". The popularity of D\u00e1maso P\u00e9rez Prado's ''[[Mambo No. 5]]'' (1952) was taking everyone by storm.\n\n==Popular dancers and dances==\nThe Palladium was known not only for its music but for its dancers, fueled by weekly dance competitions and pie contests along with a Female Best Leg Contest. Ability to dance, not class or color, was the [[social currency]] inside the club. The Palladium's top star-performers, Augie and Margo Rodr\u00edguez, took the mambo to unimaginable heights. Carlos Arroyo also known as Mr Cha Cha Taps is featured in the 1955 movie \"Mambo Madness.\" Another popular act featured was the group The Mambo and Cha-Cha-Aces with Andy, Mike and Tina. Mike Ramos and Freddie Rios did their side by side act. Marilyn Winters danced the entire floor in her one-woman show, as did Carmen Cruz. The Palladium became a showcase for the [[chachach\u00e1]], [[Merengue (dance)|merengue]], and the [[pachanga]]. These became as popular with the masses as the Mambo.\n\nThe year 1948 started the mambo craze that spread across the United States. It began at the Palladium Ballroom. At the height of its popularity, the Palladium attracted Hollywood and Broadway stars, especially on Wednesday nights, which included a free dance lesson. Dance instructors such as \"Killer Joe\" Piro \u2014 who briefly served as master of ceremonies at the Palladium when Federico Pagani was not available \u2014 Augie and Margo were featured dancers there. Cuban Pete and Millie Donay appeared all over the world. Tito Puente wrote a song for Cuban Pete. Carmen Marie Padilla would offer mass dance lessons for the huge crowds.\n\n==Jazz musicians, celebrities and Latin bands==\nThe Palladium was next to jazz clubs on West [[52nd Street (Manhattan)|52nd Street]] such as [[Birdland (jazz club)|Birdland]], CuBop City, and the [[Onyx Club]]. Jazz musicians and some celebrities would sit in and play with the Latin bands. Others watched and enjoyed the show. Examples of notables who went to the ballroom include [[Count Basie]], [[Marlon Brando]], [[Dave Brubeck]], [[Paul Desmond]], [[Joe Morello]], [[Sammy Davis Jr.]], [[Duke Ellington]], [[Ella Fitzgerald]], [[Dizzy Gillespie]], [[Billie Holiday]], [[Gene Krupa]], [[Jerry Lewis]], [[Peter Lawford]], [[Dean Martin]], [[Frank Sinatra]], [[Buddy Rich]], [[George Shearing]], [[Cal Tjader]], and [[Pedro Vargas]]. Saxophonist [[Wayne Shorter]], who lived in the New York City area during the heyday of the Palladium Ballroom, composed a piece during the 1970s called \"Palladium\" while a member of the seminal jazz-fusion group [[Weather Report]]. The song appears on their ''[[Heavy Weather (album)|Heavy Weather]]'' album and features a driving Latin rhythm.\n\n==Mambo losing popularity==\nBy the early 1960s, tastes had shifted and it was clear a new sound was on the horizon. The Palladium closed its doors in the spring of 1966. Dancers' and music fans' enthusiasm for the music was not diminished. The [[Village Gate]] in [[Greenwich Village]] opened its doors to Latin Night on Mondays and Wednesdays. Federico Pagani started Latin Nights with radio host [[Symphony Sid]] Torin and Joe Gaines. Pagani started doing the same at Tony Roma's El Corso on 86th Street and Third Avenue, Barney Googles, and the [[Cheetah (nightclub)|Cheetah]], Casa Blanca, Village Gate nightclub. These venues became the places \"the scene\" went to next. Pagani also was responsible for his input on the movie filming ''Nuestra Cosa'' (''Our Latin Thing'' ) at the Cheetah and The Red Garder with Symphony Sid.\n\n==Palladium in ''The Mambo Kings'' movie==\nThe dance floor and bandstand of the club were recreated in ''[[The Mambo Kings]]'' (1992), a film starring [[Armand Assante]] and [[Antonio Banderas]] about the era of the mambo at the Palladium Ballroom and about Federico Pagani.

The Big Three grew in popularity on the strength of their bookings at the Palladium. These bands were turning out [[Mambo (dance)|mambo]] hit after mambo hit such as \"Asia Minor\" and \"Babarabatiri\", \"Picadillo\" and \"Ran Kan Kan\", and \"Mambo Mona\". The popularity of D\u00e1maso P\u00e9rez Prado's ''[[Mambo No. 5]]'' (1952) was taking everyone by storm.\n\n==Popular dancers and dances==\nThe Palladium was known not only for its music but for its dancers, fueled by weekly dance competitions and pie contests along with a Female Best Leg Contest. Ability to dance, not class or color, was the [[social currency]] inside the club. The Palladium's top star-performers, Augie and Margo Rodr\u00edguez, took the mambo to unimaginable heights. Carlos Arroyo also known as Mr Cha Cha Taps is featured in the 1955 movie \"Mambo Madness.\" Another popular act featured was the group The Mambo and Cha-Cha-Aces with Andy, Mike and Tina. Mike Ramos and Freddie Rios did their side by side act. Marilyn Winters danced the entire floor in her one-woman show, as did Carmen Cruz. The Palladium became a showcase for the [[chachach\u00e1]], [[Merengue (dance)|merengue]], and the [[pachanga]]. These became as popular with the masses as the Mambo.\n\nThe year 1948 started the mambo craze that spread across the United States. It began at the Palladium Ballroom. At the height of its popularity, the Palladium attracted Hollywood and Broadway stars, especially on Wednesday nights, which included a free dance lesson. Dance instructors such as \"Killer Joe\" Piro \u2014 who briefly served as master of ceremonies at the Palladium when Federico Pagani was not available \u2014 Augie and Margo were featured dancers there. Cuban Pete and Millie Donay appeared all over the world. Tito Puente wrote a song for Cuban Pete. Carmen Marie Padilla would offer mass dance lessons for the huge crowds.\n\n==Jazz musicians, celebrities and Latin bands==\nThe Palladium was next to jazz clubs on West [[52nd Street (Manhattan)|52nd Street]] such as [[Birdland (jazz club)|Birdland]], CuBop City, and the [[Onyx Club]]. Jazz musicians and some celebrities would sit in and play with the Latin bands. Others watched and enjoyed the show. Examples of notables who went to the ballroom include [[Count Basie]], [[Marlon Brando]], [[Dave Brubeck]], [[Paul Desmond]], [[Joe Morello]], [[Sammy Davis Jr.]], [[Duke Ellington]], [[Ella Fitzgerald]], [[Dizzy Gillespie]], [[Billie Holiday]], [[Gene Krupa]], [[Jerry Lewis]], [[Peter Lawford]], [[Dean Martin]], [[Frank Sinatra]], [[Buddy Rich]], [[George Shearing]], [[Cal Tjader]], and [[Pedro Vargas]]. Saxophonist [[Wayne Shorter]], who lived in the New York City area during the heyday of the Palladium Ballroom, composed a piece during the 1970s called \"Palladium\" while a member of the seminal jazz-fusion group [[Weather Report]]. The song appears on their ''[[Heavy Weather (album)|Heavy Weather]]'' album and features a driving Latin rhythm.\n\n==Mambo losing popularity==\nBy the early 1960s, tastes had shifted and it was clear a new sound was on the horizon. The Palladium closed its doors in the spring of 1966. Dancers' and music fans' enthusiasm for the music was not diminished. The [[Village Gate]] in [[Greenwich Village]] opened its doors to Latin Night on Mondays and Wednesdays. Federico Pagani started Latin Nights with radio host [[Symphony Sid]] Torin and Joe Gaines. Pagani started doing the same at Tony Roma's El Corso on 86th Street and Third Avenue, Barney Googles, and the [[Cheetah (nightclub)|Cheetah]], Casa Blanca, Village Gate nightclub. These venues became the places \"the scene\" went to next. Pagani also was responsible for his input on the movie filming ''Nuestra Cosa'' (''Our Latin Thing'' ) at the Cheetah and The Red Garder with Symphony Sid.\n\n==Palladium in ''The Mambo Kings'' movie==\nThe dance floor and bandstand of the club were recreated in ''[[The Mambo Kings]]'' (1992), a film starring [[Armand Assante]] and [[Antonio Banderas]] about the era of the mambo at the Palladium Ballroom and about Federico Pagani. [[Roscoe Lee Brown]] played the part of promoter Fernando P\u00e9rez, who would listen to what one had to offer in music, could make or break candidates, and was very serious and honest in telling them whether or not they had a chance to make it. Tito Puente played himself, and [[Desi Arnaz Jr.]] played Desi Arnaz Sr. The Mambo Kings Band featured [[Ralph Irizarry]], Machito's son Mario Grillo, and others.\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== Further reading ==\n* {{cite news|author=Conzo, Joe|url=http://archive.recordonline.com/archive/2004/10/09/quepasa1.htm |title=The Palladium Ballroom, home of the mambo and cha-cha|newspaper= [[Times Herald-Record]]|date= October 9, 2004}}\n* {{cite journal|author=Garc\u00eda, David F.|url=http://redalyc.uaemex.mx/pdf/377/37716112.pdf|title=Contesting that Damned Mambo: Arsenio Rodr\u00edguez, Authenticity, and the People of El Barrio and The Bronx in the 1950s|journal=Centro Journal|date=Spring 2004|volume=XVI|number=1|pages=154\u2013175|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120913060902/http://redalyc.uaemex.mx/pdf/377/37716112.pdf|archivedate=2012-09-13}}\n* {{cite book|author=Garc\u00eda, David F.|url=https://archive.org/details/arseniorodrguezt00garc |url-access=registration|title=Arsenio Rodr\u00edguez and the transnational flows of Latin popular music|location= Philadelphia |publisher= Temple University Press|date= 2006|isbn=9781592133864 }} Cf. p.&nbsp;64 and various (see book index).\n* {{cite journal|author=Hutchinson, Sydney|title=Mambo On 2: The birth of a new form of dance in New York City|date=2004|journal=Centro Journal|volume= 16|number=2|pages=109\u2013137}}\n* {{cite news|publisher=[[Public Broadcasting Service]]: WGBH|url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/latinmusicusa/en/wat/01/05.html |title=Mambonicks: The Palladium & its Dancers ( Hour 1, Chapter 5 |work=Latin Music USA|date= October 2009}}\n* {{cite book|author=Rond\u00f3n, C\u00e9sar Miguel & Aparicio, Frances R.

It designed as a conventional small car to help Reliant move away from purely three wheeler production. It was considered a rival to the [[Austin Motor Company|Austin]] [[Mini]] and [[Hillman Imp]].\n\nIt was marketed as the smart alternative, because it had a rust-free glass-fibre body, a robust chassis and frugal fuel economy. Many models were produced from 600cc, 700cc, and 750cc with saloon, estate and van variants.\n\n== Development ==\nThe Rebel was the brainchild of Reliant Managing Director Ray Wiggin<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.reliant.website/rebel_hist.shtml|title=Reliant Rebel (1964-1974)|website=The Official Website of the Reliant Motor Club|access-date=17 December 2018}}</ref> and was developed after the death of  T.L. Williams, the founder of Reliant. Wiggin believed that people in the future would be less likely to drive three-wheeled vehicles, such as Reliant's [[Reliant Regal|Regal]], so Reliant engineers, after working on the development of the four-wheeled Sabra Carmel with [[Autocars Co.|Autocars]] of Haifa, Israel<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite book|title=The Complete Catalog of British Cars 1895-1975.|last=Culshaw|first=David|last2=Horribin|first2=Peter|publisher=Veloce Publishing PLC|year=1997|isbn=9781874105930|location=Dorchester, England, UK|pages=241}}</ref> decided to modify the then-current Regal 3/25 to create a four-wheel vehicle.\n\nThey built a rolling chassis, using many parts from other countries, with a conventional front engine, steering and suspension. But they felt that Reliant's 598cc engine wouldn't pull the weight of a finished car. Consequently, the engineers skimmed the cylinder head and fitted larger valves, giving it better [[torque]] to cope with the car's extra weight. The engine was specific to the Rebel.\n\nReliant asked [[Ogle Design]] to design the Rebel, with the idea that it should look completely different from the Regal, but should save production costs by retaining some of the Regal's parts, such as its doors and windscreen. The resulting car was 138 in. (3505&nbsp;mm) in length, 58 in. (1473&nbsp;mm) in width, and had an 89 in. (2261&nbsp;mm) wheelbase. The curb weight of the Rebel, depending on the model, was between 1185&nbsp;lbs. and 1327&nbsp;lbs. (539&nbsp;kg to 603&nbsp;kg).<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.motor-car.net/reliant/item/10248-rebel-1964-73|title=Reliant Rebel|website=Motor-Car.net|access-date=18 December 2018}}</ref> The Rebel made its public debut at the Earls Court Motor Show in 1964.<ref name=\":0\" /> The show cars were pre-production models, built in [[Turkey]] and driven to [[Earls Court Exhibition Centre|Earls Court]] overnight to properly test their durability.\n\n==Models==\n\nThe Rebel launched in October 1964 as a saloon with the same 598cc engine as used in the reliant regal 3/25 and only one trim level, but with an accessory list. These vehicles were only produced in two production batches in the Tamworth factory in November/December totaling in only around 100 original Rebel built. These vehicles are mostly seen as pre-production as they were built for dealer demonstrations only and the specification changed between each vehicle as the factory tested different fabrics and materials for the interior. The main differences in these early models were the interior which used the dashboard and steering wheel from the regal 3/25, bonnet hinges hidden in the body work, the spare wheel that was fitted under the bonnet and the interior having minimal carpeting and black gel coat.\n\nRebel prototypes had a larger front grille, after testing it was found to make the cars run too cool so on early cars the grille was not cut out of the molding leaving a \"dummy grille\" as some people call it.\n\n==600==\n\nOnly 6 months later after the rebels launch in 1965, Reliant relaunched the Rebel but calling it the rebel Deluxe (but never actually using this name again). The car was updated with a new dashboard design using different instruments, thicker seats for greater comfort and five leaf springs in the rear instead of seven for a softer ride. The top half of the grill was deleted completely and filled in smooth, orange front indicators replaced the original clear units and a unique steering wheel was added. This model in later years was simply named the Rebel 600.\n\n==700==\n\nThe Rebel 700, introduced in October 1967,<ref name=\":0\" /> had several major changes from the 600, including a full chassis redesign using stronger steel and construction, a new engine of 701cc, a move to negative earth and many other specification changes. At the Earls Court motorshow the estate model was shown for the first time and also announced it was on sale now. The estate uses longer rear windows and a large side hinged rear door, combined with the new fold-flat rear seat this made the rebel estate incrediably practical, within two years it was the best-selling Rebel model.<ref name=\":0\" /> Later, side windows that slid open could be ordered. In 1971, a van version of the rebel was introduced after many rebel estate buyers enquiries, the van model was basically the estate but without windows, rear seats could still be ordered in the van with a rear window DIY kit offered by reliant dealers - thus meaning you could buy a rebel van make it into an estate avoiding a large amount of tax.<ref name=\":0\" /> Both the estate and the van offered 46 cu. ft. of load space, which increased in the van to 60 cu. ft. without the optional front passenger seat.<ref name=\":3\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.archive.commercialmotor.com/article/24th-november-1972/45/reliant-rebel-750-5cwt-van|title=Reliant Rebel 750 5CWT Van|date=24 November 1972|website=Commercial Motor magazine archive|access-date=17 December 2018}}</ref>\nNot many Rebel 700 Vans were produced as production was in development for the 750, many more 750 vans were produced.\n\n==750==\n\nThe next evolution of the Rebel was the 750 model, introduced in October 1972.<ref name=\":0\" /> This car gained some parts with the three-wheeled [[Reliant Robin]] that was due to be introduced in 1973, parts gained were:\n:The new 748cc engine\n:Rear light clusters\n:Modified version of the 4 speed all sycro gearbox\n:Radiator\n\nThe Rebel 750 was the most popular Rebel as Reliant gave the Rebel a big marketing push in magazines and newspapers including full-page colour ads, because of this many people were only discovering the Rebel for the first time now with its large range of models.\nThe interior also had a large change, fatter more comfortable front seats were used with a soft touch padded dashboard, all the interiors now used black vinyl seats and black carpets.\nVan production saw a short-lived effort to produce more as Royal Mail needed a replacement for its fleet of Morris vans, they had already trialed the Reliant Supervan but thought the more conventional Rebel van would be a good replacement, only as little as 10 vans were trialed.\nIn early 1974 with the new Reliant Robin proving to be so popular production on all other models including the Rebel, Bond Bug, Reliant TW9 ended so more Robin models could be made.\nIn 1975 the Rebel would be replaced with the Reliant Kitten.\n\n<gallery widths=\"200px\" heights=\"150px\">\nFile:Reliant Rebel 700 WPC 92G - 1969 (5675360685).jpg|Reliant Rebel saloon\nFile:1972 Reliant Rebel 700 (14196423841).jpg|Reliant Rebel estate\n</gallery>\n\n{{clear left}}\n\n==Estate legacy==\n\nThe Reliant Rebel estate was the first time reliant would build a small estate vehicle using a large side hinged door with fold-flat rear seats, after finding this so popular Reliant would carry on using this formula for the Regal, Robin and Rialto models until 1998.\n\n==Engines==\n\nThe rebel used all of Reliant's own all aluminium OHV engines, except for the 850cc version that was launched in 1975.\n\nThe car was launched with a 598cc engine producing 28 horsepower, this was 4 more horsepower than standard 600cc from the regal 3/25, this was done as the car felt sluggish with its extra weight.\n\nAfter the introduction of the 70&nbsp;mph speedlimit on British motorways the new speed limit was seen as a target, any vehicle with a top speed lower than 70&nbsp;mph was seen to be slow, with this reliant increased the engine size to 701cc and 31&nbsp;hp, the new engine was then used in both the Rebel and the Regal.<ref name=\":0\" /> The latter model was then named the Rebel 700 in time for the October 1967 [[London Motor Show]].<ref name=Autocar1967>{{cite journal| journal = [[Autocar (magazine)|Autocar]] | volume = 127 (nbr 3740)| authorlink = Unsigned |title = Exhibition Stand 105 Reliant| pages = 45| date = October 1967}}</ref> The larger engine gave the Rebel  a top speed of 70&nbsp;mph and would later be fitted into the Regal three-wheeler becoming the regal 3/30.\n\nBy 1972 reliant fitted the 750cc engine to the rebel, this was to test the new engine before the launch of the new reliant robin the next year, the same was done with the bond bug 750. At the 1972 Motor Show Reliant launched the reliant 750, with 35&nbsp;hp it gave the Rebel 750 a top speed of 80&nbsp;mph<ref name=\":0\" /> but also gave better MPG of up to 65 the gallon.\n\nRebel engines were always of higher compression<ref name=\":1\" /> and higher horsepower because of the car's additional weight compared to the three-wheeled variants. Reliant always introduced a new engine size in the Rebel first, before the Regal or the related [[Bond Bug]] received it. All rebel engine numbers end with a capital R to signify it is a rebel engine with its modifications.\n\n==Chassis, suspension and steering==\n\nThe chassis from its center back is similar to that of the three-wheeled Regal, but the Rebel features a conventional four-wheel configuration with the front chassis section containing conventional steering and suspension. In the Rebel's case, this is the steering box from a [[Standard Ten]] with wishbones, [[trunnion]]s and ball-joints from the [[Triumph GT6]] / [[Triumph Vitesse|Vitesse]] and [[Triumph Herald]] models. The Rebel's standard 12-in. steel wheels have a PCD of 4 x 4 in. (4 x 101.6mm)<ref name=\":1\" /> and the car rides on 5.50 X 12 in. tyres.<ref name=\":2\" />\nThe leaf springs on the rebel are not Regal as many people believe as the rebel leaf springs are longer.\n\n==Gearbox==\nThe Rebel was introduced with a four-speed [[manual gearbox|gearbox]] which features [[synchromesh]] on the top three ratios.<ref name=\":1\" /> There is no synchro on first gear. The gearbox was based on that of the Regal, but had an extended tailshaft with a linkage for the gearstick.\n\nBy 1972 synchromesh had been extended to all four forward speeds as the gearbox was now based on the Robin gearbox. The gearstick was no longer on a linkage but \"projects forward from the front of the transmission tunnel\".<ref name=\":3\" /> \"The light-weight body material and the aluminium engine block meant that the car was some 15% lighter than the (slightly shorter) [[Mini]] and 35% lighter than the early [[Renault 5]]\", which was also introduced in 1972.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n==Production numbers==\n[[File:Reliant Rebel 1964 (9117701695).jpg|thumb|first registered September 1964]]\nA total of \"2,600 Rebels were made in saloon, estate and van variants. Most were sold in the UK but many were sold in the Caribbean islands\".<ref name=\":1\" /> Of the approximately 900 Rebels which were exported, a number of them were in \"left-hand drive form to suit some of their export market\".<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.kitreg.org.uk/|title=The Reliant Kitten Register|website=The Reliant Kitten Register|access-date=2 January 2019}}</ref>\n\n== Rebel 1600 GT prototype ==\nDuring the Rebel's production run, Reliant had been experimenting with a more sporting variant to complement the Scimitar GT and forthcoming Scimitar GTE. Whereas the existing Rebel was powered by 598-748cc engines with 25-35&nbsp;hp, the Rebel 1600 GT prototype <ref>{{cite book|last1=Lockton|first1=Daniel|title=Rebel without Applause|date=2003|publisher=Bookmarque Publishins|location=Minster Lovell|isbn=1870519647|page=145}}</ref> codenamed FW6 had been fitted with the 80&nbsp;hp and 92&nbsp;ft-lb (Net) / 91&nbsp;hp and 102&nbsp;ft-lb (SAE) 1599cc Ford Crossflow engine from the mk2 Ford Cortina 1600E. Reliant had a relationship with Ford using their engines in Reliant sports cars with Reliant building Ford's fibreglass truck cabs in return. The Rebel 1600 GT was a working road legal prototype and had it been given the go-ahead would have been launched in around 1968, but was never put into production as Reliant Management found out the Rebel 1600 GT could not only out perform the bigger Scimitar models (around the factory as Engineers had been racing them), but also reputedly featured a power-to-weight ratio of 204&nbsp;bhp per ton which would have exceeded that of many modern sportscars.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n{{Reliant}}\n\n[[Category:Cars introduced in 1964]]\n[[Category:Reliant vehicles]]\n", "text_old": "{{Use dmy dates|date=October 2017}}\n{{Use British English|date=October 2017}}\n{{Distinguish|AMC Rebel}}{{More citations needed|date=October 2018}}\n{{Infobox automobile\n|image        = Reliant Rebel 700 WPC 92G - 1969 (5675362439).jpg\n| caption = Rebel registered January 1969\n|name         = Reliant Rebel\n|manufacturer =[[Reliant]]\n|production   =1964\u20131974<br>2600 made\n|class        =\n|body_style   =2-door [[sedan (car)|saloon]]<br>2-door [[estate car]]<br>van\n|successor    =[[Reliant Kitten]]\n| transmission = 4 speed manual\n| length = {{convert|138|in|mm|0|abbr=on}} \n| width = {{convert|58|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}    \n| height = {{convert|55.5|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}    \n| wheelbase = {{convert|89|in|mm|0|abbr=on}} <ref name=DlyExpressLonMoShoRev1966>{{cite book |last=Cardew|first=Basil |authorlink= |coauthors= |title=Daily Express Review of the 1966 Motor Show|year=1966 |publisher=Beaverbrook Newspapers Ltd |location=London |id=}}</ref>\n| track = \n| related = [[Reliant Regal]]\n|weight       = 538.8\u2013-603.3 kg\n|engine       = 598 cc/700 cc/748 cc [[Straight-4]] \n|designer     =\n}}\n\nThe '''Reliant Rebel''' is a small four-wheeled car that was produced by [[Reliant]] between 1964 and 1974.

Wiggin believed that people in the future would be less likely to drive three-wheeled vehicles, such as Reliant's [[Reliant Regal|Regal]], so Reliant engineers, after working on the development of the four-wheeled Sabra Carmel with [[Autocars Co.|Autocars]] of Haifa, Israel<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite book|title=The Complete Catalog of British Cars 1895-1975.|last=Culshaw|first=David|last2=Horribin|first2=Peter|publisher=Veloce Publishing PLC|year=1997|isbn=9781874105930|location=Dorchester, England, UK|pages=241}}</ref> decided to modify the then-current Regal 3/25 to create a four-wheel vehicle.\n\nThey built a rolling chassis, using many parts from other countries, with a conventional front engine, steering and suspension. But they felt that Reliant's 598cc engine wouldn't pull the weight of a finished car. Consequently, the engineers skimmed the cylinder head and fitted larger valves, giving it better [[torque]] to cope with the car's extra weight. The engine was specific to the Rebel.\n\nReliant asked [[Ogle Design]] to design the Rebel, with the idea that it should look completely different from the Regal, but should save production costs by retaining some of the Regal's parts, such as its doors and windscreen. The resulting car was 138 in. (3505&nbsp;mm) in length, 58 in. (1473&nbsp;mm) in width, and had an 89 in. (2261&nbsp;mm) wheelbase. The curb weight of the Rebel, depending on the model, was between 1185&nbsp;lbs. and 1327&nbsp;lbs. (539&nbsp;kg to 603&nbsp;kg).<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.motor-car.net/reliant/item/10248-rebel-1964-73|title=Reliant Rebel|website=Motor-Car.net|access-date=18 December 2018}}</ref> The Rebel made its public debut at the Earls Court Motor Show in 1964.<ref name=\":0\" /> The show cars were pre-production models, built in [[Turkey]] and driven to [[Earls Court Exhibition Centre|Earls Court]] overnight to properly test their durability.\n\n==Models==\n\nThe Rebel launched in October 1964 as a saloon with the same 598cc engine as used in the reliant regal 3/25 and only one trim level, but with an accessory list. These vehicles were only produced in two production batches in the Tamworth factory in November/December totaling in only around 100 original rebel built. These vehicles are mostly seen as pre-production as they were built for dealer demonstrations only and the specification changed between each vehicle as the factory tested different fabrics and materials for the interior. The main differences in these early models were the interior which used the dashboard and steering wheel from the regal 3/25, bonnet hinges hidden in the body work, the spare wheel that was fitted under the bonnet and the interior having minimal carpeting and black gel coat.\n\nRebel prototypes had a larger front grille, after testing it was found to make the cars run too cool so on early cars the grille was not cut out of the molding leaving a \"dummy grille\" as some people call it.\n\n==600==\n\nOnly 6 months later after the rebels launch in 1965, Reliant relaunched the Rebel but calling it the rebel Deluxe (but never actually using this name again). The car was updated with a new dashboard design using different instruments, thicker seats for greater comfort and five leaf springs in the rear instead of seven for a softer ride. The top half of the grill was deleted completely and filled in smooth, orange front indicators replaced the original clear units and a unique steering wheel was added. This model in later years was simply named the Rebel 600.\n\n==700==\n\nThe Rebel 700, introduced in October 1967,<ref name=\":0\" /> had several major changes from the 600, including a full chassis redesign using stronger steel and construction, a new engine of 701cc, a move to negative earth and many other specification changes. At the Earls Court motorshow the estate model was shown for the first time and also announced it was on sale now. The estate uses longer rear windows and a large side hinged rear door, combined with the new fold-flat rear seat this made the rebel estate incrediably practical, within two years it was the best-selling Rebel model.<ref name=\":0\" /> Later, side windows that slid open could be ordered. In 1971, a van version of the rebel was introduced after many rebel estate buyers enquiries, the van model was basically the estate but without windows, rear seats could still be ordered in the van with a rear window DIY kit offered by reliant dealers - thus meaning you could buy a rebel van make it into an estate avoiding a large amount of tax.<ref name=\":0\" /> Both the estate and the van offered 46 cu. ft. of load space, which increased in the van to 60 cu. ft. without the optional front passenger seat.<ref name=\":3\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.archive.commercialmotor.com/article/24th-november-1972/45/reliant-rebel-750-5cwt-van|title=Reliant Rebel 750 5CWT Van|date=24 November 1972|website=Commercial Motor magazine archive|access-date=17 December 2018}}</ref>\nNot many Rebel 700 Vans were produced as production was in development for the 750, many more 750 vans were produced.\n\n==750==\n\nThe next evolution of the Rebel was the 750 model, introduced in October 1972.<ref name=\":0\" /> This car gained some parts with the three-wheeled [[Reliant Robin]] that was due to be introduced in 1973, parts gained were:\n:The new 748cc engine\n:Rear light clusters\n:Modified version of the 4 speed all sycro gearbox\n:Radiator\n\nThe Rebel 750 was the most popular Rebel as Reliant gave the Rebel a big marketing push in magazines and newspapers including full-page colour ads, because of this many people were only discovering the Rebel for the first time now with its large range of models.\nThe interior also had a large change, fatter more comfortable front seats were used with a soft touch padded dashboard, all the interiors now used black vinyl seats and black carpets.\nVan production saw a short-lived effort to produce more as Royal Mail needed a replacement for its fleet of Morris vans, they had already trialed the Reliant Supervan but thought the more conventional Rebel van would be a good replacement, only as little as 10 vans were trialed.\nIn early 1974 with the new Reliant Robin proving to be so popular production on all other models including the Rebel, Bond Bug, Reliant TW9 ended so more Robin models could be made.\nIn 1975 the Rebel would be replaced with the Reliant Kitten.\n\n<gallery widths=\"200px\" heights=\"150px\">\nFile:Reliant Rebel 700 WPC 92G - 1969 (5675360685).jpg|Reliant Rebel saloon\nFile:1972 Reliant Rebel 700 (14196423841).jpg|Reliant Rebel estate\n</gallery>\n\n{{clear left}}\n\n==Estate legacy==\n\nThe Reliant Rebel estate was the first time reliant would build a small estate vehicle using a large side hinged door with fold-flat rear seats, after finding this so popular Reliant would carry on using this formula for the Regal, Robin and Rialto models until 1998.\n\n==Engines==\n\nThe rebel used all of Reliant's own all aluminium OHV engines, except for the 850cc version that was launched in 1975.\n\nThe car was launched with a 598cc engine producing 28 horsepower, this was 4 more horsepower than standard 600cc from the regal 3/25, this was done as the car felt sluggish with its extra weight.\n\nAfter the introduction of the 70&nbsp;mph speedlimit on British motorways the new speed limit was seen as a target, any vehicle with a top speed lower than 70&nbsp;mph was seen to be slow, with this reliant increased the engine size to 701cc and 31&nbsp;hp, the new engine was then used in both the Rebel and the Regal.<ref name=\":0\" /> The latter model was then named the Rebel 700 in time for the October 1967 [[London Motor Show]].<ref name=Autocar1967>{{cite journal| journal = [[Autocar (magazine)|Autocar]] | volume = 127 (nbr 3740)| authorlink = Unsigned |title = Exhibition Stand 105 Reliant| pages = 45| date = October 1967}}</ref> The larger engine gave the Rebel  a top speed of 70&nbsp;mph and would later be fitted into the Regal three-wheeler becoming the regal 3/30.\n\nBy 1972 reliant fitted the 750cc engine to the rebel, this was to test the new engine before the launch of the new reliant robin the next year, the same was done with the bond bug 750. At the 1972 Motor Show Reliant launched the reliant 750, with 35&nbsp;hp it gave the Rebel 750 a top speed of 80&nbsp;mph<ref name=\":0\" /> but also gave better MPG of up to 65 the gallon.\n\nRebel engines were always of higher compression<ref name=\":1\" /> and higher horsepower because of the car's additional weight compared to the three-wheeled variants. Reliant always introduced a new engine size in the Rebel first, before the Regal or the related [[Bond Bug]] received it. All rebel engine numbers end with a capital R to signify it is a rebel engine with its modifications.\n\n==Chassis, suspension and steering==\n\nThe chassis from its center back is similar to that of the three-wheeled Regal, but the Rebel features a conventional four-wheel configuration with the front chassis section containing conventional steering and suspension. In the Rebel's case, this is the steering box from a [[Standard Ten]] with wishbones, [[trunnion]]s and ball-joints from the [[Triumph GT6]] / [[Triumph Vitesse|Vitesse]] and [[Triumph Herald]] models. The Rebel's standard 12-in. steel wheels have a PCD of 4 x 4 in. (4 x 101.6mm)<ref name=\":1\" /> and the car rides on 5.50 X 12 in. tyres.<ref name=\":2\" />\nThe leaf springs on the rebel are not Regal as many people believe as the rebel leaf springs are longer.\n\n==Gearbox==\nThe Rebel was introduced with a four-speed [[manual gearbox|gearbox]] which features [[synchromesh]] on the top three ratios.<ref name=\":1\" /> There is no synchro on first gear. The gearbox was based on that of the Regal, but had an extended tailshaft with a linkage for the gearstick.\n\nBy 1972 synchromesh had been extended to all four forward speeds as the gearbox was now based on the Robin gearbox. The gearstick was no longer on a linkage but \"projects forward from the front of the transmission tunnel\".<ref name=\":3\" /> \"The light-weight body material and the aluminium engine block meant that the car was some 15% lighter than the (slightly shorter) [[Mini]] and 35% lighter than the early [[Renault 5]]\", which was also introduced in 1972.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n==Production numbers==\n[[File:Reliant Rebel 1964 (9117701695).jpg|thumb|first registered September 1964]]\nA total of \"2,600 Rebels were made in saloon, estate and van variants. Most were sold in the UK but many were sold in the Caribbean islands\".<ref name=\":1\" /> Of the approximately 900 Rebels which were exported, a number of them were in \"left-hand drive form to suit some of their export market\".<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.kitreg.org.uk/|title=The Reliant Kitten Register|website=The Reliant Kitten Register|access-date=2 January 2019}}</ref>\n\n== Rebel 1600 GT prototype ==\nDuring the Rebel's production run, Reliant had been experimenting with a more sporting variant to complement the Scimitar GT and forthcoming Scimitar GTE. Whereas the existing Rebel was powered by 598-748cc engines with 25-35&nbsp;hp, the Rebel 1600 GT prototype <ref>{{cite book|last1=Lockton|first1=Daniel|title=Rebel without Applause|date=2003|publisher=Bookmarque Publishins|location=Minster Lovell|isbn=1870519647|page=145}}</ref> codenamed FW6 had been fitted with the 80&nbsp;hp and 92&nbsp;ft-lb (Net) / 91&nbsp;hp and 102&nbsp;ft-lb (SAE) 1599cc Ford Crossflow engine from the mk2 Ford Cortina 1600E. Reliant had a relationship with Ford using their engines in Reliant sports cars with Reliant building Ford's fibreglass truck cabs in return. The Rebel 1600 GT was a working road legal prototype and had it been given the go-ahead would have been launched in around 1968, but was never put into production as Reliant Management found out the Rebel 1600 GT could not only out perform the bigger Scimitar models (around the factory as Engineers had been racing them), but also reputedly featured a power-to-weight ratio of 204&nbsp;bhp per ton which would have exceeded that of many modern sportscars.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n{{Reliant}}\n\n[[Category:Cars introduced in 1964]]\n[[Category:Reliant vehicles]]\n", "name_user": "Bigcartv", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eModels", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reliant_Rebel"}
