{"title_page": "Deaths in May 2015", "text_new": "{{Deaths in month TOC}}\nThe following is a list of '''notable deaths in May 2015'''.\n\nEntries for each day are listed <u>alphabetically</u> by surname. A typical entry lists information in the following sequence:\n*Name, age, country of citizenship and reason for notability, established cause of death, reference.\n<!--\n********** Please read before adding a name to this list **********\n\nOnly those meeting the [[Wikipedia:Notability (people)|Wikipedia notability]] guidelines are listed, with a reference to a [[Wikipedia:Reliable sources|reliable source]].

Tragic deaths, while unfortunate, do not necessarily make the deceased \"notable\".

On the first occasion some forty mounted men were collected in the Tug before our zariba; but this did not satisfy the Sultan, and he arranged a second \"fantasia,\" in which fully two hundred warriors were engaged. It was the best and most characteristic thing of the kind I had ever seen. A procession was first formed in the river's bed, and on a given signal all dashed off, brandishing their spears and shields. Dressed in tobes of many colours, and sitting loosely on their gaily-caparisoned horses, they engaged in mimic contest with spear and shield, reining their horses upon their haunches when at full gallop, and with wild shouts flinging their spears into the air. Each warrior carried a short-handled whip with a broad raw hide thong, and with it lashed his steed unmercifully. Some of the riders went through regular circus feats, leaping from their horses when at full gallop, picking up objects thrown on the ground, and then remounting. After this had continued for some time they would gallop close to our zariba, and reining up, shout \"Mort, mort\" (\"Welcome, welcome\"), to which we replied, \"Kul liban\" (\"Thanks\").<ref>The Unknown Horn of Africa: An Exploration From Berbera to the Leopard River, by Frank Linsly james, p.67</ref></blockquote>\n[[File:Garhajis-Sanaag-Sool.png|thumb|300px|Map showing Garhajis territory in the [[Sanaag]] and [[Sool, Somalia|Sool]] regions, circa 1840]]\nD.

In 1841 Sharmarke with 50 [[Matchlock]] men, 2 [[cannons]] and an army of mounted spearmen managed to invade Zeila and depose its Arab Governor, Mohammed Al Barr. Sharmarke used the canons to fire at the city walls which frightened Al Barr's followers and caused them to flee. Sharmarke succeeded Al Barr as the ruler of Zeila and its dependencies.<ref>First footseps in to Africa, by Richard Burton, p.16-p.30</ref><ref> Sun, sand and Somals; leaves from the note-book of a district commissioner in British Somaliland, by Rayne Henry. p.15-16</ref> Sharmarke's governorship had an instant effect on the city, as he maneuvered to monopolize as much of the regional trade as possible, with his sights set as far as Harar and the Ogaden.<ref>Ethiopia: the Era of the Princes: The Challenge of Islam and Re-unification of the Christian Empire, 1769-1855. p.18 </ref> Having secured Zeila, in 1845 Sharmarke moved on to Berbera which at the time was experiencing instability as a result of a war between the [[Habr Awal]] Reer Yunis Nur and Reer Ahmed Nur sub-clans over the control of Berbera's trade. Sharmarke took advantage of this rivalry and supported the Reer Ahmed Nuh who had since been expelled from Berbera. Sharmarke took over Berbera and  built four [[Martello tower|Martello towers]] in the vicinity of the town and garrisoned them with 30 [[Matchlock]] men. A war ensued with in the city as Reer Yunis Nuh tried gain a foothold within Berbera, the Reer Yunis Nuh were no match for Sharmarke and his modern weapons and thus failed.

These battles are today known as the Rayyad or Guba Wars. It was a volatile era that gave birth to some of the best known Somali poetry.\n\nIn 1874 German Explorer G.A Haggenmacher witnessed the aftermath of a battle between Habr yunis and Ogaden. He wrote:\n<blockquote>The Habr Yunis had many wounded, but were also extremely rich in loot, the estimated number of loot was at least 10,000 camels.<ref>G. A. Haggenmacher's Reise Im Somali-Lande, 1874: Mit Einer Originalkarte by G.A.</ref></blockquote>\n\nIn 1877 the Garhajis under the leadership of Sultan Hersi Aman conquered [[Daroor (woreda)|Daroor]] and subjugated the Haroun sub-clan of the Ogaden, during the battle they captured and subsequently executed their Sultan.<ref>The Unknown Horn of Africa, by James, F.

This particular series of conquests was what initiated the famous chains of poems known as ''Guba'' in which [[Ali Dhuh]] a [[Daarood]] poet laments, and berates the Ogadenis for losing so much land and exchanges heated poems with the Ogaden and Habr Yunis.<ref name=PXV>Proceedings of the XVth International Conference of Ethiopian Studies Hamburg (2003), p. 215.</ref><ref>{{cite web|url= https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=39JMAgAAQBAJ&pg=RA2-PA171&lpg=RA2-PA171&dq=Ali+Dhuh&source=bl&ots=1zdp4mrsUp&sig=tEhYPccXZpdwFBSYVNZfwrIpPug&hl=en&sa=X&redir_esc=y#v=onepage&q=Ali%20Dhuh&f=false|title= Dictionary of African Biography. 1St- Ed.; 1970 , p.171 |first=}}</ref>\n\nHistorian Siegbert Uhlig commenting on the Guba poem writes the following:\n\n<blockquote>From a historical point of view Ali dhuhs poem explicitly details the large gains in traditionally Ogaden territory and wells, and the looting of Ogaden camels by the Isaq. He details the scatterring of the Ogaden clan, their forced migration southwards seeking refuge in the feverish river valleys, and even turning to hunting and farming- measures that were again considered very shameful usually only undertaken by slaves and low-caste Somalis and utterly demeaning for the once great pastoral Ogaden clan. The Ogaden, Ali recounts, have been forced to accept refuge with the clans that defeated them, especially the Habr Yunis, and cannot take revenge. The Isaq are portrayed as particularly callous and shameful in the way they parade looted Ogaden camels in front of their previous owners. Even in translation it is a very evocative poem\".<ref name=PXV/></blockquote>\n\nThe Habr Yunis advance into Ogaden territory was eventually halted by the intervention of the [[British Somaliland|British protectrate]] authorities with assistance from the Ethiopian Empire, who considered the Ogaden their subjects and whose safety was their priority. In one incident the Habar Yunis looted 1330 camels from the Ogaden, but were pressured by the British and the Ethiopians to return the camels to their previous owners. The Habr Yunis obliged and promised to desist in their raids, but despite their promise they continued to successfully raid the Ogadens unhindered up until the British ceded the Haud to Ethiopia.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=_8YVBAAAQBAJ&pg=PA149&dq=Ogaden+camels+Habr+Yunis&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjg4rKyheTZAhULCMAKHRgQCLcQ6AEIJzAA#v=onepage&q=Ogaden%20camels%20Habr%20Yunis&f=false |title= Churchill and the Mad Mullah of Somaliland ,p.149|first=}}</ref><ref>The Mad Mullah of Somaliland, Douglas Jardine, p.197</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=Ukw6AQAAMAAJ&q=looted+camels+Habr+yunis&dq=looted+camels+Habr+yunis&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiKrtLfjencAhVsBMAKHQJlAK4Q6AEIVTAJ |title= The Parliamentary Debates (official Report) House of Commons. 4th session of the 28th Parliament through the 1st session of the 48th Parliament, 1914.|first=}}</ref>\n\n===Dervish period===\nThe Garhajis clan played a prominent role in the inception of the [[Dervish state|Dervish movement]] and its subsequent struggle against the [[British Empire]]. Among the prominent members of the Dervish was the Sultan of the Habar Yunis, [[Nur Ahmed Aman]], whose letter to [[Mohammed Abdullah Hassan]] initiated the Dervish rebillion. Nur was the principle agitator that rallied the dervish behind his anti-French [[Catholic missions|Catholic Mission]] campaign that would become the cause of the dervish uprise.<ref>Foreign Department-External-B, August 1899, N. 33-234, NAI, New Delhi, Inclosure 2 in No. 1.

The incident in question was that of a group of Somali children that were converted to Christianity and adopted by the French Catholic Mission at Berbera in 1899. Whether Sultan Nur experienced the incident first hand or whether he was told of it is not clear but what is known is that he propagated the incident in the [[Tariqa]] at Kob Fardod in June 1899 precipitating the religious rebellion that later morphed into the Somali Dervish.<ref>F.O.78/5031,Sayyid Mohamad To The Aidagalla, Enclosed Sadler To Salisbury. 69, 20 August 1899.</ref>\n\nSultan Nur leading his Dervish clansmen participated in numerous battles against the British. These confrontations took place at Samala, Ferdidin, Erigo, Daratoleh and Gumburu. In 1899 Sultan Nur was among the top five (Mohammed Abdullah Hassan, [[Haji Sudi]], Deria Arrale and Deria Gure) wanted leaders of the movement.<ref>Official history of the operations in Somaliland, 1901\u201304 by Great Britain.

In his article Macfayden only identified Sultan Nur's tomb by name out of the four dervish entombed in Taleh:\n\n<blockquote>\"South of the main cave-well is the considerable tomb of Abdullah Hasan\nsenior, well plastered inside and out; it is now said to be empty.

The Gadwein Dervishes who were located in coastal [[Sanaag]] and the towns of  [[Midisho]] and Jidali created complications for the Warsengeli Sultanate, who they regularly raided. The Warsengeli who were at that time allied with the British called for their assistance. Consequently, in 1912 the British sent the warship [[HMS Philomel (1890)|HMS Philomel]] and shelled the Gadwein Dervishes, pushing them from the coast and inland towards Las Dureh.<ref>Official History of the Operation Volume 1, p.49</ref><ref>The Mad Mullah of Somaliland , p.252-p.258</ref><ref>{{cite web|url= \nhttp://www.drabruzzi.com/Mad%20Mullah%20of%20Northern%20Somaliland.pdf |title= The \"Mad Mullah\" and Northern Somalia,by Robert L.Hess|first=}}</ref><ref name=\"kings coll1\">{{cite web|url= \nhttp://www.kingscollections.org/exhibitions/archives/armies-abroad/dervish-state/establishment#Gallery[gallery1]/1/ |title= King's College London, King's collection: Ismay's summary as Intelligence Officer (1916-1918) of Mohammed Abdullah Hassan|first=}}</ref> The Dervish forces of Sanaag were supplied with arms and munitions by two Habr Yunis men of the Musa Arreh clan, namely, Haji Hirsi of [[Maydh]] and Bulhan Ali, they both operated with in [[Yemen]], the former being stationed at [[Mukalla]] and the latter at [[Aden]].

Captain Gibb had advanced with his interpreter to quell the disturbance, when 1954 fire was opened upon him by some riflemen, and he was instantly killed. The murderers escaped under cover of falling darkness.\nCaptain Gibb was an officer of long and valued service in Somaliland, whose loss I deeply regret. From the information available, his murder does not appear to have been premeditated, but it inevitably had a disturbing effect upon the surrounding tribes, and immediate dispositions of troops became necessary in order to ensure the apprehension and punishment of those responsible for the murder. On 27th February the Governor telegraphed that, in order to meet the situation which had arisen, he required two aeroplanes for purposes of demonstration, and suggested that two aeroplanes from the Royal Air Force Detachment at Aden should fly over to Berber a from Aden. He also telegraphed that in certain circumstances it might become necessary to ask for reinforcements of troops to be sent to the Protectorate.<ref>1922 Commons sitting.

The Isaaq Sultanate was established in the mid-18th century by Sultan Guled Abdi Eise of the Eidagale clan. His coronation took place after the victorious battle of Lafaruug in which he successfully led the Eidagale in battle and defeated the Absame tribes, permanently pushing them out of present-day Waqooyi Galbeed region. After witnessing his leadership skills, noble conduct and valiance, the Isaaq chiefs recognized him as their Grand Sultan. Guled's Sultanate predates the Habr Yunis Sultanate, which broke off from Eidagale tutelage several decades after the start of his rule. Sultan Guled ruled the Isaaq from the 1750's up until his death in the early 19th century, where he was succeeded by his eldest son Farah. Sultan Farah further expanded the influence of the Sultanate by establishing ties with various Muslim polities across the Gulf, particularly the [[Al-Qasimi]] family whom he regularly corresponded with in regard to military action against the British Navy who blockaded Berbera and threatening to cut off vital trade.<ref>http://t-3abersbeelculture.blogspot.com/2014/03/blog-post_14.html?m=1</ref> \n\nFor centuries, the tomb of saint [[Aw Barkhadle]], which is located between [[Berbera]] and [[Hargeisa]], was used by the Isaaq clans to settle disputes and to swear oaths of alliances under a holy relic attributed to [[Bilal Ibn Rabah]].

Sugulleh was succeeded by his son Diriyeh Sugule in the late 18th century. Sultan Diriyeh reigned for more than 50 years and was eventually succeeded by his grandson Hersi Aman. Hersi is most notable for expanding Habr Yunis territory in the Haud and for engaging the first Rer Sugulleh civil war which resulted in his death. Sultan Hersi's death caused a decade-long civil war when his nephew Nur was crowned Sultan and his great uncle Awad Sultan Deriyeh and eldest living son of sultan Deriyeh declared himself a rival sultan in 1881.The two Sultans were now at war with each other and divided the Kingdoms territory between themselves, with Nur being based in the Toyo plains and Awd establishing himself at Burao. In the 1890's Sultan Awad was killed in a battle which resulted in Sultan Nur facing no opposition and was the sole ruler of the Habr Yunis Sultanate up until he started the Dervish uprising, which resulted in his uncle Madar Hersi being crowned. The Habr Yunis were now divided into two factions: pro-Dervish and anti-Dervish, the former being ruled by Sultan Nur and the latter the newly crowned Sultan Madar. After Nur's death in the Dervish camp, the Habr Yunis elders crowned his son Dolal, and with the Dervish defeat none of his heirs succeeded him leaving Madar's descendants as the undisputed Sultans of the Habr Yunis.<ref >Cosmos: communicazioni sui progressi recenti e notevoli della geografia e delle scienze affini di Guido Cora p. 201</ref><ref>''British Somaliland'' by Drake Borckmen, p. 79 - 82, 1912</ref> \n\n===Sultans of the Habr Yunis===\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!\n!Name\n!Reign\nFrom\n!Reign\nTill\n\n|-\n|1\n| style=\"white-space:nowrap\" | '''Ainasha Hersi''' (''traditional chief'')\n| style=\"white-space:nowrap\" |\n|\n|\n|-\n|2\n| style=\"white-space:nowrap\" |''Sultan'' '''Sugulleh''' Ainasha (''first sultan'')\n| style=\"white-space:nowrap\" |\n|\n|\n|-\n|3\n| style=\"white-space:nowrap\" |''Sultan'' '''Diriyeh''' ''Sultan'' Sugulleh Ainasha \n| style=\"white-space:nowrap\" |\n|\n|\n|-\n|4\n| style=\"white-space:nowrap\" |''Sultan'' '''Hersi''' ''Aman'' ''Sultan'' Diriyeh\n| style=\"white-space:nowrap\" |\n|\n|\n|-\n|5\n| style=\"white-space:nowrap\" |''Sultan'' '''Nur''' ''Ahmed'' Aman ''Sultan'' Diriyeh \n| style=\"white-space:nowrap\" |\n|\n|\n|-\n|6\n| style=\"white-space:nowrap\" |''Sultan'' '''Awad''' ''Sultan'' Diiriye\n| style=\"white-space:nowrap\" |\n|\n|\n|-\n|7\n| style=\"white-space:nowrap\" |''Sultan'' '''Dolal''' ''Sultan'' Nur\n| style=\"white-space:nowrap\" |\n|\n|\n|-\n|8\n| style=\"white-space:nowrap\" |''Sultan'' '''Madar''' Hersi ''Sultan'' cabdale\n| style=\"white-space:nowrap\" |\n|\n|\n|-\n|9\n| style=\"white-space:nowrap\" |''Sultan'' '''Ali''' ''Sultan'' Madar Hersi\n| style=\"white-space:nowrap\" |\n|\n|\n|-\n|10\n| style=\"white-space:nowrap\" |''Sultan'' '''Osman''' ''Sultan'' Ali ''Sultan'' Madar\n| style=\"white-space:nowrap\" |\n| \n|\n|}\n\n== Clan tree==\n\nA summarized clan family tree of the major Garhajis subclan of Habar Yonis is presented below.<ref name=\"musa 140\">{{cite web|url= \nhttps://books.google.co.uk/books?id=yPVWJxtLG6IC&pg=PA140&dq=Musa+Arreh&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiHmcfOjvjZAhVBW8AKHQWxDUIQ6AEIJzAA#v=onepage&q=Musa%20Arreh&f=false|title= A grammar of the Somali Language, p.140|first=}}</ref><ref name=\"survey 147\">A general survey of the Somaliland Protectorate 1944-1950, p147</ref>\n*Sheikh Isaaq Bin Ahmed (Sheikh Isaaq)\n**''Habar Habuusheed''\n***  Ahmed (Tol-Ja'lo) \n***  Muuse (Habr Je'lo)\n***  Ibrahiim (Sanbuur)\n***  Muhammad ('Ibraan)\n** ''Habar Magaadle''\n*** Abdirahman (Subeer Awal)\n***  Ayub\n***  Muhammad (Arap)\n*** '''Ismail''' ('''Garhajis''')\n**** Said Ismail (Habar Yonis) \n*****Ali Said\n*****Arreh Said\n******Ishaq Arreh\n*******Abdalle Ishaq \n*******Qaasin Ishaq\n******Musa Arreh\n*******Hassan Musa,Ibrahim Musa,Damal Musa (Dir Roble)\n******Ismail Arreh\n*******Sa'ad Yunis\n*******Musa Ismail\n********Salah Musa (Turwa)\n********Salah Musa\n********Mohammed Musa (Urursuge)\n********Yunis Musa\n*******Abdallah Ismail\n********Idris (idrays)\n********Musa Abdallah\n********Omar Abdallah \n*********Hersi Osman\n**********Said Hersi\n***********Rer Warsama (Waraba)\n***********Rer Weid\n**********Abdi Hersi\n**********Ainanshe Hersi (The Ainanshe Hersi are the royal sub-clan of the Habr Yunis and the hereditary Sultanate is currently held by them.)<ref name=gram>{{cite web|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=89k8AAAAIAAJ&pg=PA141&dq=Farah+Ainanshe&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiaqOrNovLZAhWPW8AKHS2CCBgQ6AEIODAD#v=onepage&q=Farah%20Ainanshe&f=false |title= A grammar of the Somali language, p. 141.|first=}}</ref><ref name=\"survey 147\"/>\n***********Sugulle Ainanshe \n***********Eise Ainanshe\n***********Wa\u2019ays Ainanshe\n***********Suban Ainanshe\n***********Abdi Ainanshe\n***********Egal Ainanshe\n***********Omar Ainanshe\n***********Koshin Ainanshe \n***********Maygag Ainanshe \n***********Butiye Ainanshe\n***********Ahmed Ainanshe\n***********Farah Ainanshe\n***********Samaale Ainanshe\n***********Hersi Ainanshe\n***********Guled Ainanshe\n***********Gutale Ainanshe\n***********Liibaan Ainanshe \n*Daud Ismail (Eidagale) (The Eidagale sub-clan are divided into the following sections)<ref name=\"musa 140\"/>\n**Abokor Musa\n**Rer Yunis Abdurahman\n**Ba delo\n**Gashanbur\n**Damal Yera\n**Rer Esa\n\n==Notable people==\n\n* [[Abdirahman Ahmed Ali Tuur]],The first President of Somaliland and the last Somali National Movement(SNM) Chairman. \n* [[Abdullahi Qarshe]], Somali musician, poet and playwright;

On the first occasion some forty mounted men were collected in the Tug before our zariba; but this did not satisfy the Sultan, and he arranged a second \"fantasia,\" in which fully two hundred warriors were engaged. It was the best and most characteristic thing of the kind I had ever seen. A procession was first formed in the river's bed, and on a given signal all dashed off, brandishing their spears and shields. Dressed in tobes of many colours, and sitting loosely on their gaily-caparisoned horses, they engaged in mimic contest with spear and shield, reining their horses upon their haunches when at full gallop, and with wild shouts flinging their spears into the air. Each warrior carried a short-handled whip with a broad raw hide thong, and with it lashed his steed unmercifully. Some of the riders went through regular circus feats, leaping from their horses when at full gallop, picking up objects thrown on the ground, and then remounting. After this had continued for some time they would gallop close to our zariba, and reining up, shout \"Mort, mort\" (\"Welcome, welcome\"), to which we replied, \"Kul liban\" (\"Thanks\").<ref>The Unknown Horn of Africa: An Exploration From Berbera to the Leopard River, by Frank Linsly james, p.67</ref></blockquote>\n[[File:Garhajis-Sanaag-Sool.png|thumb|300px|Map showing Garhajis territory in the [[Sanaag]] and [[Sool, Somalia|Sool]] regions, circa 1840]]\nD.

Sharmarke took advantage of this rivalry and supported the Reer Ahmed Nuh who had since been expelled from Berbera. Sharmarke took over Berbera and  built four [[Martello tower|Martello towers]] in the vicinity of the town and garrisoned them with 30 [[Matchlock]] men.

These battles are today known as the Rayyad or Guba Wars. It was a volatile era that gave birth to some of the best known Somali poetry.\n\nIn 1874 German Explorer G.A Haggenmacher witnessed the aftermath of a battle between Habr yunis and Ogaden. He wrote:\n<blockquote>The Habr Yunis had many wounded, but were also extremely rich in loot, the estimated number of loot was at least 10,000 camels.<ref>G. A. Haggenmacher's Reise Im Somali-Lande, 1874: Mit Einer Originalkarte by G.A.</ref></blockquote>\n\nIn 1877 the Garhajis under the leadership of Sultan Hersi Aman conquered [[Daroor (woreda)|Daroor]] and subjugated the Haroun sub-clan of the Ogaden, during the battle they captured and subsequently executed their Sultan.<ref>The Unknown Horn of Africa, by James, F.

This particular series of conquests was what initiated the famous chains of poems known as ''Guba'' in which [[Ali Dhuh]] a [[Daarood]] poet laments, and berates the Ogadenis for losing so much land and exchanges heated poems with the Ogaden and Habr Yunis.<ref name=PXV>Proceedings of the XVth International Conference of Ethiopian Studies Hamburg (2003), p. 215.</ref><ref>{{cite web|url= https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=39JMAgAAQBAJ&pg=RA2-PA171&lpg=RA2-PA171&dq=Ali+Dhuh&source=bl&ots=1zdp4mrsUp&sig=tEhYPccXZpdwFBSYVNZfwrIpPug&hl=en&sa=X&redir_esc=y#v=onepage&q=Ali%20Dhuh&f=false|title= Dictionary of African Biography. 1St- Ed.; 1970 , p.171 |first=}}</ref>\n\nHistorian Siegbert Uhlig commenting on the Guba poem writes the following:\n\n<blockquote>From a historical point of view Ali dhuhs poem explicitly details the large gains in traditionally Ogaden territory and wells, and the looting of Ogaden camels by the Isaq. He details the scatterring of the Ogaden clan, their forced migration southwards seeking refuge in the feverish river valleys, and even turning to hunting and farming- measures that were again considered very shameful usually only undertaken by slaves and low-caste Somalis and utterly demeaning for the once great pastoral Ogaden clan. The Ogaden, Ali recounts, have been forced to accept refuge with the clans that defeated them, especially the Habr Yunis, and cannot take revenge. The Isaq are portrayed as particularly callous and shameful in the way they parade looted Ogaden camels in front of their previous owners. Even in translation it is a very evocative poem\".<ref name=PXV/></blockquote>\n\nThe Habr Yunis advance into Ogaden territory was eventually halted by the intervention of the [[British Somaliland|British protectrate]] authorities with assistance from the Ethiopian Empire, who considered the Ogaden their subjects and whose safety was their priority. In one incident the Habar Yunis looted 1330 camels from the Ogaden, but were pressured by the British and the Ethiopians to return the camels to their previous owners. The Habr Yunis obliged and promised to desist in their raids, but despite their promise they continued to successfully raid the Ogadens unhindered up until the British ceded the Haud to Ethiopia.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=_8YVBAAAQBAJ&pg=PA149&dq=Ogaden+camels+Habr+Yunis&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjg4rKyheTZAhULCMAKHRgQCLcQ6AEIJzAA#v=onepage&q=Ogaden%20camels%20Habr%20Yunis&f=false |title= Churchill and the Mad Mullah of Somaliland ,p.149|first=}}</ref><ref>The Mad Mullah of Somaliland, Douglas Jardine, p.197</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=Ukw6AQAAMAAJ&q=looted+camels+Habr+yunis&dq=looted+camels+Habr+yunis&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiKrtLfjencAhVsBMAKHQJlAK4Q6AEIVTAJ |title= The Parliamentary Debates (official Report) House of Commons. 4th session of the 28th Parliament through the 1st session of the 48th Parliament, 1914.|first=}}</ref>\n\n===Dervish period===\nThe Garhajis clan played a prominent role in the inception of the [[Dervish state|Dervish movement]] and its subsequent struggle against the [[British Empire]]. Among the prominent members of the Dervish was the Sultan of the Habar Yunis, [[Nur Ahmed Aman]], whose letter to [[Mohammed Abdullah Hassan]] initiated the Dervish rebillion. Nur was the principle agitator that rallied the dervish behind his anti-French [[Catholic missions|Catholic Mission]] campaign that would become the cause of the dervish uprise.<ref>Foreign Department-External-B, August 1899, N. 33-234, NAI, New Delhi, Inclosure 2 in No. 1.

The incident in question was that of a group of Somali children that were converted to Christianity and adopted by the French Catholic Mission at Berbera in 1899. Whether Sultan Nur experienced the incident first hand or whether he was told of it is not clear but what is known is that he propagated the incident in the [[Tariqa]] at Kob Fardod in June 1899 precipitating the religious rebellion that later morphed into the Somali Dervish.<ref>F.O.78/5031,Sayyid Mohamad To The Aidagalla, Enclosed Sadler To Salisbury. 69, 20 August 1899.</ref>\n\nSultan Nur leading his Dervish clansmen participated in numerous battles against the British. These confrontations took place at Samala, Ferdidin, Erigo, Daratoleh and Gumburu. In 1899 Sultan Nur was among the top five (Mohammed Abdullah Hassan, [[Haji Sudi]], Deria Arrale and Deria Gure) wanted leaders of the movement.<ref>Official history of the operations in Somaliland, 1901\u201304 by Great Britain.

The Gadwein Dervishes who were located in coastal [[Sanaag]] and the towns of  [[Midisho]] and Jidali created complications for the Warsengeli Sultanate, who they regularly raided. The Warsengeli who were at that time allied with the British called for their assistance. Consequently, in 1912 the British sent the warship [[HMS Philomel (1890)|HMS Philomel]] and shelled the Gadwein Dervishes, pushing them from the coast and inland towards Las Dureh.<ref>Official History of the Operation Volume 1, p.49</ref><ref>The Mad Mullah of Somaliland , p.252-p.258</ref><ref>{{cite web|url= \nhttp://www.drabruzzi.com/Mad%20Mullah%20of%20Northern%20Somaliland.pdf |title= The \"Mad Mullah\" and Northern Somalia,by Robert L.Hess|first=}}</ref><ref name=\"kings coll1\">{{cite web|url= \nhttp://www.kingscollections.org/exhibitions/archives/armies-abroad/dervish-state/establishment#Gallery[gallery1]/1/ |title= King's College London, King's collection: Ismay's summary as Intelligence Officer (1916-1918) of Mohammed Abdullah Hassan|first=}}</ref> The Dervish forces of Sanaag were supplied with arms and munitions by two Habr Yunis men of the Musa Arreh clan, namely, Haji Hirsi of [[Maydh]] and Bulhan Ali, they both operated with in [[Yemen]], the former being stationed at [[Mukalla]] and the latter at [[Aden]].

Captain Gibb had advanced with his interpreter to quell the disturbance, when 1954 fire was opened upon him by some riflemen, and he was instantly killed. The murderers escaped under cover of falling darkness.\nCaptain Gibb was an officer of long and valued service in Somaliland, whose loss I deeply regret. From the information available, his murder does not appear to have been premeditated, but it inevitably had a disturbing effect upon the surrounding tribes, and immediate dispositions of troops became necessary in order to ensure the apprehension and punishment of those responsible for the murder. On 27th February the Governor telegraphed that, in order to meet the situation which had arisen, he required two aeroplanes for purposes of demonstration, and suggested that two aeroplanes from the Royal Air Force Detachment at Aden should fly over to Berber a from Aden. He also telegraphed that in certain circumstances it might become necessary to ask for reinforcements of troops to be sent to the Protectorate.<ref>1922 Commons sitting.

The Isaaq Sultanate was established in the mid-18th century by Sultan Guled Abdi Eise of the Eidagale clan. His coronation took place after the victorious battle of Lafaruug in which he successfully led the Eidagale in battle and defeated the Absame tribes, permanently pushing them out of present-day Waqooyi Galbeed region. After witnessing his leadership skills, noble conduct and valiance, the Isaaq chiefs recognized him as their Grand Sultan. Guled's Sultanate predates the Habr Yunis Sultanate, which broke off from Eidagale tutelage several decades after the start of his rule. Sultan Guled ruled the Isaaq from the 1750's up until his death in the early 19th century, where he was succeeded by his eldest son Farah. Sultan Farah further expanded the influence of the Sultanate by establishing ties with various Muslim polities across the Gulf, particularly the [[Al-Qasimi]] family whom he regularly corresponded with in regard to military action against the British Navy who blockaded Berbera and threatening to cut off vital trade.<ref>http://t-3abersbeelculture.blogspot.com/2014/03/blog-post_14.html?m=1</ref> \n\nFor centuries, the tomb of saint [[Aw Barkhadle]], which is located between [[Berbera]] and [[Hargeisa]], was used by the Isaaq clans to settle disputes and to swear oaths of alliances under a holy relic attributed to [[Bilal Ibn Rabah]].

Sugulleh was succeeded by his son Diriyeh Sugule in the late 18th century. Sultan Diriyeh reigned for more than 50 years and was eventually succeeded by his grandson Hersi Aman. Hersi is most notable for expanding Habr Yunis territory in the Haud and for engaging the first Rer Sugulleh civil war which resulted in his death. Sultan Hersi's death caused a decade-long civil war when his nephew Nur was crowned Sultan and his great uncle Awad Sultan Deriyeh and eldest living son of sultan Deriyeh declared himself a rival sultan in 1881.The two Sultans were now at war with each other and divided the Kingdoms territory between themselves, with Nur being based in the Toyo plains and Awd establishing himself at Burao. In the 1890's Sultan Awad was killed in a battle which resulted in Sultan Nur facing no opposition and was the sole ruler of the Habr Yunis Sultanate up until he started the Dervish uprising, which resulted in his uncle Madar Hersi being crowned. The Habr Yunis were now divided into two factions: pro-Dervish and anti-Dervish, the former being ruled by Sultan Nur and the latter the newly crowned Sultan Madar. After Nur's death in the Dervish camp, the Habr Yunis elders crowned his son Dolal, and with the Dervish defeat none of his heirs succeeded him leaving Madar's descendants as the undisputed Sultans of the Habr Yunis.<ref >Cosmos: communicazioni sui progressi recenti e notevoli della geografia e delle scienze affini di Guido Cora p. 201</ref><ref>''British Somaliland'' by Drake Borckmen, p. 79 - 82, 1912</ref> \n\n===Sultans of the Habr Yunis===\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!\n!Name\n!Reign\nFrom\n!Reign\nTill\n\n|-\n|1\n| style=\"white-space:nowrap\" | '''Ainasha Hersi''' (''traditional chief'')\n| style=\"white-space:nowrap\" |\n|\n|\n|-\n|2\n| style=\"white-space:nowrap\" |''Sultan'' '''Sugulleh''' Ainasha (''first sultan'')\n| style=\"white-space:nowrap\" |\n|\n|\n|-\n|3\n| style=\"white-space:nowrap\" |''Sultan'' '''Diriyeh''' ''Sultan'' Sugulleh Ainasha \n| style=\"white-space:nowrap\" |\n|\n|\n|-\n|4\n| style=\"white-space:nowrap\" |''Sultan'' '''Hersi''' ''Aman'' ''Sultan'' Diriyeh\n| style=\"white-space:nowrap\" |\n|\n|\n|-\n|5\n| style=\"white-space:nowrap\" |''Sultan'' '''Nur''' ''Ahmed'' Aman ''Sultan'' Diriyeh \n| style=\"white-space:nowrap\" |\n|\n|\n|-\n|6\n| style=\"white-space:nowrap\" |''Sultan'' '''Awad''' ''Sultan'' Diiriye\n| style=\"white-space:nowrap\" |\n|\n|\n|-\n|7\n| style=\"white-space:nowrap\" |''Sultan'' '''Dolal''' ''Sultan'' Nur\n| style=\"white-space:nowrap\" |\n|\n|\n|-\n|8\n| style=\"white-space:nowrap\" |''Sultan'' '''Madar''' Hersi ''Sultan'' cabdale\n| style=\"white-space:nowrap\" |\n|\n|\n|-\n|9\n| style=\"white-space:nowrap\" |''Sultan'' '''Ali''' ''Sultan'' Madar Hersi\n| style=\"white-space:nowrap\" |\n|\n|\n|-\n|10\n| style=\"white-space:nowrap\" |''Sultan'' '''Osman''' ''Sultan'' Ali ''Sultan'' Madar\n| style=\"white-space:nowrap\" |\n| \n|\n|}\n\n== Clan tree==\n\nA summarized clan family tree of the major Garhajis subclan of Habar Yonis is presented below.<ref name=\"musa 140\">{{cite web|url= \nhttps://books.google.co.uk/books?id=yPVWJxtLG6IC&pg=PA140&dq=Musa+Arreh&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiHmcfOjvjZAhVBW8AKHQWxDUIQ6AEIJzAA#v=onepage&q=Musa%20Arreh&f=false|title= A grammar of the Somali Language, p.140|first=}}</ref><ref name=\"survey 147\">A general survey of the Somaliland Protectorate 1944-1950, p147</ref>\n*Sheikh Isaaq Bin Ahmed (Sheikh Isaaq)\n**''Habar Habuusheed''\n***  Ahmed (Tol-Ja'lo) \n***  Muuse (Habr Je'lo)\n***  Ibrahiim (Sanbuur)\n***  Muhammad ('Ibraan)\n** ''Habar Magaadle''\n*** Abdirahman (Subeer Awal)\n***  Ayub\n***  Muhammad (Arap)\n*** '''Ismail''' ('''Garhajis''')\n**** Said Ismail (Habar Yonis) \n*****Ali Said\n*****Arreh Said\n******Ishaq Arreh\n*******Abdalle Ishaq \n*******Qaasin Ishaq\n******Musa Arreh\n*******Hassan Musa,Ibrahim Musa,Damal Musa (Dir Roble)\n******Ismail Arreh\n*******Sa'ad Yunis\n*******Musa Ismail\n********Salah Musa (Turwa)\n********Salah Musa\n********Mohammed Musa (Urursuge)\n********Yunis Musa\n*******Abdallah Ismail\n********Idris (idrays)\n********Musa Abdallah\n********Omar Abdallah \n*********Hersi Osman\n**********Said Hersi\n***********Rer Warsama (Waraba)\n***********Rer Weid\n**********Abdi Hersi\n**********Ainanshe Hersi (The Ainanshe Hersi are the royal sub-clan of the Habr Yunis and the hereditary Sultanate is currently held by them.)<ref name=gram>{{cite web|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=89k8AAAAIAAJ&pg=PA141&dq=Farah+Ainanshe&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiaqOrNovLZAhWPW8AKHS2CCBgQ6AEIODAD#v=onepage&q=Farah%20Ainanshe&f=false |title= A grammar of the Somali language, p. 141.|first=}}</ref><ref name=\"survey 147\"/>\n***********Sugulle Ainanshe \n***********Eise Ainanshe\n***********Wa\u2019ays Ainanshe\n***********Suban Ainanshe\n***********Abdi Ainanshe\n***********Egal Ainanshe\n***********Omar Ainanshe\n***********Koshin Ainanshe \n***********Maygag Ainanshe \n***********Butiye Ainanshe\n***********Ahmed Ainanshe\n***********Farah Ainanshe\n***********Samaale Ainanshe\n***********Hersi Ainanshe\n***********Guled Ainanshe\n***********Gutale Ainanshe\n***********Liibaan Ainanshe \n*Daud Ismail (Eidagale) (The Eidagale sub-clan are divided into the following sections)<ref name=\"musa 140\"/>\n**Abokor Musa\n**Rer Yunis Abdurahman\n**Ba delo\n**Gashanbur\n**Damal Yera\n**Rer Esa\n\n==Notable people==\n\n* [[Abdirahman Ahmed Ali Tuur]],The first President of Somaliland and the last Somali National Movement(SNM) Chairman. \n* [[Abdullahi Qarshe]], Somali musician, poet and playwright;

They destroyed the Jewish settlement in [[Cranganore]] and sacked the Jewish town in [[Cochin]] and partially destroyed the famous Cochin Synagogue in 1661. However, the [[Netherlands|Dutch]] were more tolerant and allowed the Jews to pursue their normal life and trade in Cochin.  According to the testimony of the Dutch Jew, Mosss Pereya De Paiva, in 1686 there were 10 synagogues and nearly 500 Jewish families in Cochin.  Later Britishers too were tolerant. The Jews were protected.  After the creation of the State of [[Israel]] in 1948, most Jews decided to emigrate to Israel.  Most of the emigrants to Israel between 1948 and 1955 were from the community of ''black Jews'' and ''brown Jews''; they are known as [[Cochin Jews|Cochini]] in Israel.

The constituency was abolished by the [[Redistribution of Seats Act 1885]].\n\n== History ==\nThe [[parliamentary borough]] was based upon the community of [[Liskeard]] in the south-eastern part of [[Cornwall]].\n\nSedgwick estimated the electorate at 30 in 1740. Namier and Brooke considered it was about 50 in the 1754\u20131790 period. The right of election before 1832 was in the freemen of the borough. This constituency was under the patronage of the Eliot family, which acquired the predominant interest by 1722.\n\nThere were no contested elections between at least 1715 and 1802.  In the early 19th century the Whigs attempted to expand the electorate to include householders.  During the [[1802 United Kingdom general election|1802 general election]], 48 householders claimed the right to vote but their ballots were rejected by the Mayor (see the note to the 1802 election result below).  The Eliot family continued to control the borough in the Tory interest, for another thirty years.\n\nThe [[Reform Act 1832]] augmented the freemen voters (who retained their ancient right votes), with the beneficiaries of a new householder franchise. The number of voters registered in 1832 was 218. The political effect of the change was that a Whig was elected unopposed to the one remaining seat in 1832, whereas the two Tory candidates had been elected unopposed at the previous seven general elections. Only Whig or Liberal candidates were returned from 1832 until the constituency was abolished.\n\nThe [[Reform Act 1867]] preserved the borough constituency but slightly expanded the electorate (from 434 in 1865 to 881 in 1868). '''Liskeard''' was one of the smallest boroughs to retain individual representation in the 1868\u20131885 period. However the constituency was finally abolished by the [[Redistribution of Seats Act 1885]], when the borough became part of the [[Bodmin (UK Parliament constituency)|Bodmin]] or South East [[county division|division]] of Cornwall.\n\n== Members of Parliament ==\n\n===1295\u20131629===\n* ''Constituency created'' (1295)\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!Parliament!!First member!!Second

From 1832 the principal source was Craig, with additional or different information from Stooks Smith included. Candidates classified by Craig as Liberal before 1859, are labeled as Whig or Radical (following Stooks Smith) or Liberal if their exact allegiance is uncertain. Similarly candidates classified by Craig as Conservative but by Stooks Smith as Tory are listed below as Tory.\n\n''Note on percentage change calculations:'' Where there was only one candidate of a party in successive elections, for the same number of seats, change is calculated on the party percentage vote. Where there was more than one candidate for a party, in one or both successive contested elections for the same number of seats, then change is calculated on the individual candidates percentage vote.\n\n''Note on party allegiance of candidates:'' A party label is only used when the source used quotes one. Other candidates are labelled Non Partisan, but may have associated themselves with a tendency or faction in Parliament.\n\n===Elections before 1715===\nDates of Parliaments 1660\u20131715\n{|

The constituency was abolished by the [[Redistribution of Seats Act 1885]].\n\n== History ==\nThe [[parliamentary borough]] was based upon the community of [[Liskeard]] in the south-eastern part of [[Cornwall]].\n\nSedgwick estimated the electorate at 30 in 1740. Namier and Brooke considered it was about 50 in the 1754\u20131790 period. The right of election before 1832 was in the freemen of the borough. This constituency was under the patronage of the Eliot family, which acquired the predominant interest by 1722.\n\nThere were no contested elections between at least 1715 and 1802.  In the early 19th century the Whigs attempted to expand the electorate to include householders.  During the [[1802 United Kingdom general election|1802 general election]], 48 householders claimed the right to vote but their ballots were rejected by the Mayor (see the note to the 1802 election result below).  The Eliot family continued to control the borough in the Tory interest, for another thirty years.\n\nThe [[Reform Act 1832]] augmented the freemen voters (who retained their ancient right votes), with the beneficiaries of a new householder franchise. The number of voters registered in 1832 was 218. The political effect of the change was that a Whig was elected unopposed to the one remaining seat in 1832, whereas the two Tory candidates had been elected unopposed at the previous seven general elections. Only Whig or Liberal candidates were returned from 1832 until the constituency was abolished.\n\nThe [[Reform Act 1867]] preserved the borough constituency but slightly expanded the electorate (from 434 in 1865 to 881 in 1868). '''Liskeard''' was one of the smallest boroughs to retain individual representation in the 1868\u20131885 period. However the constituency was finally abolished by the [[Redistribution of Seats Act 1885]], when the borough became part of the [[Bodmin (UK Parliament constituency)|Bodmin]] or South East [[county division|division]] of Cornwall.\n\n== Members of Parliament ==\n\n===1295\u20131629===\n* ''Constituency created'' (1295)\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!Parliament!!First member!!Second

From 1832 the principal source was Craig, with additional or different information from Stooks Smith included. Candidates classified by Craig as Liberal before 1859, are labeled as Whig or Radical (following Stooks Smith) or Liberal if their exact allegiance is uncertain. Similarly candidates classified by Craig as Conservative but by Stooks Smith as Tory are listed below as Tory.\n\n''Note on percentage change calculations:'' Where there was only one candidate of a party in successive elections, for the same number of seats, change is calculated on the party percentage vote. Where there was more than one candidate for a party, in one or both successive contested elections for the same number of seats, then change is calculated on the individual candidates percentage vote.\n\n''Note on party allegiance of candidates:'' A party label is only used when the source used quotes one. Other candidates are labelled Non Partisan, but may have associated themselves with a tendency or faction in Parliament.\n\n===Elections before 1715===\nDates of Parliaments 1660\u20131715\n{|

It was intended to be a romantic allegorical account of Maximilian's own participation in a series of [[Tournament (medieval)|jousting tournaments]] in the guise of the tale's eponymous hero, Freydal. In the story, Freydal takes part in the tournaments to prove that he is worthy to marry a princess, who is a fictionalised representation of Maximilian's late wife, [[Mary of Burgundy]].\n\nThe text was never completed, although a manuscript draft is held by the [[Austrian National Library]]. 256 [[Miniature (illuminated manuscript)|miniature paintings]] to accompany the text were created by court painters, and 255 are preserved in an [[illuminated manuscript]] \u2018tournament book\u2019 held by the [[Kunsthistorisches Museum]] in [[Vienna]]. These miniatures vividly record the different types of jousts that were popular at the time as well as the [[Masquerade ball|court masquerades]], or \u2018mummeries\u2019, that took place at the end of the day after each tournament. It is the most extensive visual record of late medieval tournaments and court masquerades that exists.\n\n==Background==\n[[File:Albrecht D\u00fcrer - Portrait of Maximilian I - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|left|Portrait of [[Maximilian I, Holy Roman Emperor|Maximilian I]] by [[Albrecht D\u00fcrer]], 1519.]]\n[[Maximilian I, Holy Roman Emperor|Maximilian I]] and his father [[Frederick III, Holy Roman Emperor|Frederick III]] were part of what was to become a long line of [[Holy Roman Emperors]] from the [[House of Habsburg]].

This results in a spectacular splintering of the lances. In the ''Scharfrennen'' (joust of war with flying shields) the shield is shown loosely fixed to the rider's breastplate, the aim being to dislodge it. In contrast, the objective of the ''Antzogenrennen'' is to unseat the opponent and his shield is fixed to his armour.<ref name=moma121/> The ''Feldrennen'' (or ''Kampfrennen'') jousts replicate skirmishes in war and the riders wear battlefield armour.

Not only is it the largest surviving tournament book, it is also an unparalleled pictorial source of jousting from the late medieval period.<ref>{{harvnb|Terjanian|2019|pp=120-121}}</ref> It is the only one to depict spectacular falls.<ref name=Freeman/> In addition to illustrating the jousts themselves, it represents a remarkable catalogue of the weaponry used during tournaments<ref name=Freeman/> and is the most extensive record of mummery, the early court masquerade, that exists.<ref name=moma122/> The manuscript has been recognised in [[UNESCO]]\u2019s [[Memory of the World Programme]].<ref>{{harvnb|Taschen Catalogue}}</ref>\n\nHowever, ''Freydal'' was intended to be not only an artistic work but also political propaganda.<ref>{{harvnb|Barber|1974|p=298}}</ref> As part of what he called his \u2018memorial projects\u2019 or ''Gedechtnus'', Maximilian I used literary and visual works such as ''Freydal'' to model and enhance his public image. His aim was to make up for his actual powerlessness and lack of centralised control over his own realms by presenting himself and his exploits as superior to any others.<ref name=muller>{{harvnb| M\u00fcller|2003|pp=307-308}}</ref> As the historian [[Jan-Dirk M\u00fcller]] ([[:de:Jan-Dirk M\u00fcller |de]]) has said, the extent to which Maximilian employed this strategy meant that his court \u201cliterally existed on paper: to a large extent it was a virtual quantity\u201d.<ref name=muller/>\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n== Bibliography ==\n{{refbegin|60em}}\n* {{cite web |url=

It was intended to be a romantic allegorical account of Maximilian's own participation in a series of [[Tournament (medieval)|jousting tournaments]] in the guise of the tale's eponymous hero, Freydal. In the story, Freydal takes part in the tournaments to prove that he is worthy to marry a princess, who is a fictionalised representation of Maximilian's late wife, [[Mary of Burgundy]].\n\nThe text was never completed, although a manuscript draft is held by the [[Austrian National Library]]. 256 [[Miniature (illuminated manuscript)|miniature paintings]] to accompany the text were created by court painters, and 255 are preserved in an [[illuminated manuscript]] \u2018tournament book\u2019 held by the [[Kunsthistorisches Museum]] in [[Vienna]]. These miniatures vividly record the different types of jousts that were popular at the time as well as the [[Masquerade ball|court masquerades]], or \u2018mummeries\u2019, that took place at the end of the day after each tournament. It is the most extensive visual record of late medieval tournaments and court masquerades that exists.\n\n==Background==\n[[File:Albrecht D\u00fcrer - Portrait of Maximilian I - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|left|Portrait of [[Maximilian I, Holy Roman Emperor|Maximilian I]] by [[Albrecht D\u00fcrer]], 1519.]]\n[[Maximilian I, Holy Roman Emperor|Maximilian I]] and his father [[Frederick III, Holy Roman Emperor|Frederick III]] were part of what was to become a long line of [[Holy Roman Emperors]] from the [[House of Habsburg]]. Maximilian was elected [[King of the Romans]] in 1486; upon his father's death in 1493 he succeeded to the throne of the Holy Roman Empire.<ref>{{harvnb|Terjanian|2019|p=303}}</ref>\n\nDuring his reign, Maximilian commissioned a number of [[Renaissance humanism|humanist]] scholars and artists to assist him in completing a series of projects, in different art forms, intended to immortalize his life and deeds and those of his Habsburg ancestors.<ref name=\"Watanabe-O'Kelly94\">{{harvnb| Watanabe-O'Kelly|2000|p=94}}</ref> He referred to these projects as ''Gedechtnus'' (\"memorial\"),<ref name=\"Kleinschmidt162\">{{harvnb|Kleinschmidt|2008|p=162}}</ref> and included a series of stylised autobiographical works: ''Freydal'', the prose romance ''[[Weisskunig]]'', and the poem ''[[Theuerdank]]''.<ref name=\"Watanabe-O'Kelly94\"/>\n\n''Freydal'' and ''Theuerdank'' are closely linked and together give an allegorical account of the events leading to Maximilian's marriage to [[Mary of Burgundy]] in 1477.<ref name=moma120>{{harvnb| Terjanian |2019|p=120}}</ref> Mary died five years later, in 1482.<ref>{{harvnb|Terjanian|2019|p=300}}</ref> In ''Freydal'', which is partly a tribute to Mary,<ref name=\"Clephan 1995 88\">{{harvnb|Clephan|1995|p=88}}</ref> the eponymous hero pursues his fair lady by [[jousting]] in [[Tournament (medieval)|tournaments]].<ref name=Freeman>{{harvnb|Freeman|2019}}</ref> ''Theuerdank'' is effectively a sequel in which the hero overcomes dangers on the journey to his wedding.<ref name=moma120/> ''Freydal'' has a comedic tone which contrasts with ''Theuerdank'', which has more of the character of a tragedy.<ref name=McLaren/>\n\nThe theme of ''Freydal'' reflects Maximilian's lifelong enthusiasm for jousting. He attended his first tournament at the age of 14 and was captivated by its traditions and spectacle.<ref name=Freeman/> He staged many tournaments, including those to celebrate his wedding to Mary of Burgundy in 1477, his coronation as King of the Romans in 1486 and on the occasion of the [[First Congress of Vienna]] in 1515.<ref name=Freeman/> Maximilian was himself a participant in tournaments from 1485 until 1511, when he was in his 50s.<ref>{{harvnb|Anderson|2017|pp=104\u2013105}}</ref> His affinity for jousting contributed to his [[soubriquet]] the \u201clast knight\u201d.<ref name=Freeman/>\n[[File:Freydal fol164.jpg|upright=1.2|thumb|right|Post-tournament festivities: grotesque-style dancers or mummers dance a [[moresca]] while Freydal, in a mask and holding torches, looks on (''Freydal'' ms. fol.164, [[Kunsthistorisches Museum|KMW]])<ref name=Locke123/>]]\n\n==Creation and history==\nMaximilian appears to have begun planning ''Freydal'' in 1502.<ref name=moma123>{{harvnb| Terjanian |2019|p=123}}</ref> The name ''Freydal'' was derived from ''Freyd-alb'', meaning \"white joyful young man\".<ref>{{harvnb|Strobl|1913|p=4}}</ref> In that year, he instructed his court taylor, Martin Trummer \"to have drawn in a book all those costumes as yet seen in mummeries organised by his majesty\".<ref name=moma123/> A \u201cmummery\u201d was a late medieval courtly [[Masquerade ball|masquerade]] or costumed dance.<ref name=moma122>{{harvnb| Terjanian |2019|p=122}}</ref>\n\nThis developed into the commissioning of planning sketches for the entire work, created over the next ten years.<ref name=moma123/> They were drawn in pen on [[laid paper]], using brown and black ink with watercolour over black chalk and leadpoint.<ref name=moma123/> A collection of 203 of these are housed in the [[National Gallery of Art]] in [[Washington, D.C.]]<ref>{{harvnb| Terjanian |2019|pp=120, 123}}</ref> A small number of additional drawings are held at the [[British Museum]] and the [[Vatican Library]].<ref name=moma123/>\n\nMaximilian took a leading part in the creation of the work.<ref name=Clephan87>{{harvnb|Clephan|1995|p=87}}</ref> His instructions on the subjects to be illustrated as well as corrections, in his own hand, of some of the proofs have survived.

The narrative ends with Freydal setting out to search for her, and ''Theuerdank'' then takes up the subsequent story.<ref name=moma121/>\n\nThe work reflects Maximilian's vanity, as exemplified by a poem which forms part of the draft text:<ref name=\"Clephan 1995 88\"/>{{Quotation|This did the gallant Freydal<br>In knightly deeds of fame<br>Thus rendering illustrious<br>The glories of his name.<br>His virtues and his goodness<br>Are manifest to all;<br>His many glorious triumphs<br>At tilt, at masks and ball...<br>His like will ne\u2019er be seen again.<ref>translation {{harvnb|Clephan|1995|p=88, note 1}}</ref>}}\n\nHowever, the tournaments described are based on encounters Maximilian actually had. This is evidenced by a list of people involved in the story in the first seven [[Paper quire|quire]]s of the draft text, and who are known to have been actual courtiers.<ref name=Silver64/>\n\n===Illuminated manuscript tournament book===\n[[File:Freydal 02.jpg|upright=1.2|thumb|left|Freydal in a \u201cjoust of war with flying and exploding shields\u201d (''Geschifttartschen-Rennen'') with Sigmund von Welsperg (''Freydal'' ms. fol. 29, [[Kunsthistorisches Museum|KMW]])<ref>{{harvnb|Krause|2014|pp=175\u2013176}}</ref>]]\nThe miniatures in the tournament book manuscript illustrate the types of [[jousting]] popular at the time, both on horse and on foot.<ref name=McLaren/> Freydal features in each illustrated combat and his opponent is an historical figure with whom Maximilian actually jousted.<ref name=McLaren/> Each picture, in the lower margin, identifies the name of the opponent and the other courtiers depicted.<ref name=Locke123>{{harvnb|Locke|2015|p=123}}</ref>\n\nTwo types of joust, ''Rennen'' (or \u201cjousts of war\u201d where the lance has a sharpened tip<ref name= joust>{{harvnb|Jeep|2001|p=759}}; {{harvnb|Silver|2002|p=63}}</ref>) and ''Stechen'' (or \u201cjousts of peace\u201d where the lance has a blunted tip<ref name= joust/>) are depicted for each tournament.<ref name=Clephan87/><ref name=moma121/> Within these two broad groupings, eleven sub-types are shown.<ref name=moma121/> In the ''Welsches Gestecht'' (Italian joust of peace) a board separates the jousters so that they can ride more closely to each other and strike their opponent frontally with greater force. This results in a spectacular splintering of the lances. In the ''Scharfrennen'' (joust of war with flying shields) the shield is shown loosely fixed to the rider's breastplate, the aim being to dislodge it. In contrast, the objective of the ''Antzogenrennen'' is to unseat the opponent and his shield is fixed to his armour.<ref name=moma121/> The ''Feldrennen'' (or ''Kampfrennen'') jousts replicate skirmishes in war and the riders wear battlefield armour. The rarest type of joust depicted is the ''Kr\u00f6nlrennen'' where one rider wears the armour of a joust of peace but wields the lance of a joust of war and the other rider  has the opposite combination.<ref name=moma122/>\n\nOne of the most spectacular jousts depicted is the ''Bundrennen'' (joust of war with flying shields without [[bevors]])<ref name=moma121/> and its variation, ''Geschifttartschen-Rennen'' (joust of war with flying and exploding shields).<ref name=moma125>{{harvnb|Terjanian|2019|p=125}}</ref> In the ''Bundrennen'', the shield is held in place on the rider's breastplate with a complicated spring mechanism and when it is struck in the right place by the opponent it is ejected high into the air.<ref name=moma121/> The ''Geschifttartschen-Rennen'' increases the spectacle by attaching multiple triangular platelets to the shield which, when the shield is ejected, come loose and explode into the air like a firework display.<ref name=moma125/> Maximilian claimed to have invented this type of joust.<ref name=Freeman/> \n[[File:Freydal 05.jpg|upright=1.2|thumb|right|Foot combat between Freydal and Claude de Vaudry (''Freydal'' ms. fol. 39, [[Kunsthistorisches Museum|KMW]])<ref name=moma120/>]]\nIn each of the tournaments, the participants are shown engaging in a foot combat. A variety of weapons are used, including [[Mace (bludgeon)|iron clubs]] (''Eisenkolben''), [[Flail (weapon)|flails]] (''Drischel''), swords (''Turnierschwert'')<ref name=krause179>{{harvnb|Krause|2014|p=179}}</ref> and daggers.<ref name=krause181>{{harvnb|Krause|2014|p=181}}</ref> The ''[[Melee (tournament)|m\u00eal\u00e9e]]'' is also shown in the manuscript.<ref name=Clephan87/>\n\nAfter each of the sixty-four tournaments is a scene depicting a [[moresca]] (a pantomime dance) or other post-tournament festivities with male courtiers, including the knights who had competed in the tournament, dressing up to dance in a variety of exotic costumes.<ref name=Locke121/> Known as \u2018mummeries\u2019, these were a regular feature of the evening entertainment after tournaments.<ref name=moma122/>\n\nThe male courtiers in the mummeries in the manuscript dress up, amongst other things, in costumes based on nationality or ethnicity, for example [[Ottoman Turks|Turkish]], [[Republic of Venice|Venetian]] or [[Burgundian Netherlands|Burgundian]] costume, or as animals such as [[apes]] and creatures with bird's heads.<ref name=Locke121/> In one masquerade illustrated, the male participants engage in [[cross-dressing]] and wear women's gowns.<ref name=moma122/>\n\nIn each scene, all the men are dressed in the same costume and normally wear a mask.

Not only is it the largest surviving tournament book, it is also an unparalleled pictorial source of jousting from the late medieval period.<ref>{{harvnb|Terjanian|2019|pp=120-121}}</ref> It is the only one to depict spectacular falls.<ref name=Freeman/> In addition to illustrating the jousts themselves, it represents a remarkable catalogue of the weaponry used during tournaments<ref name=Freeman/> and is the most extensive record of mummery, the early court masquerade, that exists.<ref name=moma122/> The manuscript has been recognised in [[UNESCO]]\u2019s [[Memory of the World Programme]].<ref>{{harvnb|Taschen Catalogue}}</ref>\n\nHowever, ''Freydal'' was intended to be not only an artistic work but also political propaganda.<ref>{{harvnb|Barber|1974|p=298}}</ref> As part of what he called his \u2018memorial projects\u2019 or ''Gedechtnus'', Maximilian I used literary and visual works such as ''Freydal'' to model and enhance his public image. His aim was to make up for his actual powerlessness and lack of centralised control over his own realms by presenting himself and his exploits as superior to any others.<ref name=muller>{{harv| M\u00fcller|2003|pp=307-308}}</ref> As the historian [[Jan-Dirk M\u00fcller]] ([[:de:Jan-Dirk M\u00fcller |de]]) has said, the extent to which Maximilian employed this strategy meant that his court \u201cliterally existed on paper: to a large extent it was a virtual quantity\u201d.<ref name=muller/>\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n== Bibliography ==\n{{refbegin|60em}}\n* {{cite web |url=
