The engineer, William Rockefeller, later admitted that before reaching the curve he had gone into a \"daze\", a sort of [[highway hypnosis]].\n\nThe leader of the [[National Transportation Safety Board]] (NTSB) team investigating said it was likely that the accident would have been prevented had [[positive train control]] (PTC) been installed per a prior federal mandate requiring its installation by 2015. Due to a number of other recent accidents involving Metro-North trains and tracks, the [[Federal Railroad Administration]] (FRA) demanded improved safety measures, which Metro-North began implementing within a week of the accident.\n\nIn late 2014, almost a year after the accident, the NTSB released its final report on the accident. After reiterating its earlier conclusion that PTC would have prevented the accident entirely, it found the most direct cause was Rockefeller's inattention as the train entered the curve. There were other contributing factors. A medical examination following the accident diagnosed [[sleep apnea]], which had hampered his ability to fully adjust his sleep patterns to the morning shift which he had begun working two weeks earlier. The report faulted both Metro-North for not screening its employees in sensitive positions for [[sleep disorder]]s, and the FRA for not requiring railroads to do such screening.<ref name=\"NTSB brief\" />\n\n=={{anchor|Train}}Background==\n\nThe train involved in the accident was the second southbound [[Hudson Line (Metro-North)|Hudson Line]] train of the day, leaving [[Poughkeepsie (Metro-North station)|Poughkeepsie]], the line's northern terminus, at its scheduled departure time of 5:54&nbsp;a.m. [[Eastern Standard Time (North America)|EST]].<ref name=\"current Metro-North schedule\">[[Metropolitan Transportation Authority]], {{cite web|url= http://web.mta.info/mnr/html/planning/schedules/pdf/NOV172013HUD-SS.pdf |title=Hudson Line weekend schedule|publisher=[[Metropolitan Transportation Authority]]|date= November 17, 2013|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131216041718/http://www.mta.info/mnr/html/planning/schedules/pdf/NOV172013HUD-SS.pdf|archivedate=December 16, 2013|accessdate=April 13, 2020}}</ref> It was powered by a [[GE Genesis|GE P32AC-DM]] [[dual-mode locomotive|locomotive]],<ref name=\"Rockefeller interview transcript\">{{cite web|title=Transcript of Interview 8808 Engineer|url=http://dms.ntsb.gov/public%2F55500-55999%2F55841%2F551511.pdf|publisher=[[National Transportation Safety Board]]|page=48|date=December 3, 2013|accessdate=October 31, 2014}}</ref> capable of running on either diesel fuel or electricity from a [[third rail]].

After a [[2008 Chatsworth train collision|2008 wreck]] in [[Los Angeles, California|Los Angeles]], the FRA mandated all American railroads implement PTC by 2015. Many resisted, complaining about the cost of the technology. Among those railroads were both MTA commuter railroads, Metro-North and the [[Long Island Rail Road]], which have sought to have that deadline extended until 2018. In the wake of the Spuyten Duyvil derailment, U.S. Rep. [[Sean Patrick Maloney]], a resident of [[Cold Spring, New York|Cold Spring]] whose neighbor James Lovell was one of those killed, introduced legislation to make low-interest loans and guarantees available so that commuter railroads like Metro-North could implement PTC.<ref name=\"FRA letter story\" /> Eventually other congressmembers from the lower Hudson Valley joined as cosponsors.<ref name=\"Journal News Deep Dive story\">{{cite news|last=Juva-Brown|first=Theresa|title=Bronx derailment: Grants program pushed for Metro-North|url=http://www.lohud.com/article/20131215/NEWS/312150049/Bronx-derailment-Grants-program-pushed-Metro-North-|newspaper=[[The Journal News]]|date=December 15, 2013|accessdate=December 18, 2013}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Metro-North crew installing speed restriction sign.jpg|thumb|left|Metro-North crews install speed-restriction sign on a stretch of the [[New Haven Line]] two weeks after the Spuyten Duyvil accident|alt=Four men in reflectorized orange vests and neon green helmets standing next to a set of four railroad tracks installing a signpost next to the track.

Instead they pointed to doubts about the technology's efficacy for large commuter rail networks. On a radio talk show following the crash, New York Governor [[Andrew Cuomo]] conceded that PTC is \"controversial ...

It sounds an alarm when the train exceeds speed limits for 25 seconds and shuts it down after an additional 15 seconds if no action is taken by the engineer. It might have been able to prevent the accident; however it was in the locomotive, at the rear of the train, not the cab where Rockefeller was located.<ref name=\"NYT alerter story\" />\n\nWhile Metro-North used it only to prevent collisions, rail safety experts said it could easily be configured to force trains to slow down at curves such as Spuyten Duyvil, since it relied on signals sent through the rails themselves. It was also preferable to the traditional [[dead man's switch]] the cab was equipped with, which requires constant action and attention from the engineer. The MTA said it was considering doing so at 30 sites on the Metro-North and LIRR networks.<ref name=\"NYT alerter story\" /> On December 6, the FRA issued an emergency order requiring Metro-North to have two qualified crew members in the cab at any point where the speed limit drops by more than {{convert|20|mph}} until it installs that technology in cabs and at those sites.<ref name=\"FRA mandate story\" /> The next day Metro-North announced it was upgrading the signals at the Spuyten Duyvil curve and several others in the system; it would also lower the speed limit going into the curve so that it would be a less-than-20-mph drop and thus the extra engineer would not be necessary.<ref name=\"MTA changes story\">{{cite news|title=Safety Upgrades Coming to Metro-North Derailment Site: MTA|url=http://www.nbcnewyork.com/news/local/Safety-Upgrades-MTA-Metro-North-Train-Derailment-Bronx-Spuyten-Duyvil-Curve-234987791.html|newspaper=[[WNBC-TV]]|date=December 8, 2013|accessdate=December 8, 2013}}</ref> U.S. Senators [[Richard Blumenthal]] of Connecticut and [[Charles Schumer]] of New York called on Metro-North to install cameras to monitor both the track and the engineers.<ref name=\"Senators call for cameras\">{{cite news|last=Castillo|first=Alfonso A.|title=Senators call for train cameras to monitor engineer, track|url=http://www.newsday.com/long-island/senators-call-for-train-cameras-to-monitor-engineer-track-1.6564959|newspaper=[[Newsday]]|date=December 8, 2013|accessdate=December 9, 2013}}</ref>\n\nOn December 12, the FRA went further. It ordered \"Operation Deep Dive,\"<ref name=\"Journal News Deep Dive story\" /> a full safety review of Metro-North, in which every aspect of its corporate culture would be evaluated by a panel of rail safety experts.

The engineer, William Rockefeller, later admitted that before reaching the curve he had gone into a \"daze\", a sort of [[highway hypnosis]].\n\nThe leader of the [[National Transportation Safety Board]] (NTSB) team investigating said it was likely that the accident would have been prevented had [[positive train control]] (PTC) been installed per a prior federal mandate requiring its installation by 2015. Due to a number of other recent accidents involving Metro-North trains and tracks, the [[Federal Railroad Administration]] (FRA) demanded improved safety measures, which Metro-North began implementing within a week of the accident.\n\nIn late 2014, almost a year after the accident, the NTSB released its final report on the accident. After reiterating its earlier conclusion that PTC would have prevented the accident entirely, it found the most direct cause was Rockefeller's inattention as the train entered the curve. There were other contributing factors. A medical examination following the accident diagnosed [[sleep apnea]], which had hampered his ability to fully adjust his sleep patterns to the morning shift which he had begun working two weeks earlier. The report faulted both Metro-North for not screening its employees in sensitive positions for [[sleep disorder]]s, and the FRA for not requiring railroads to do such screening.<ref name=\"NTSB brief\" />\n\n=={{anchor|Train}}Background==\n\nThe train involved in the accident was the second southbound [[Hudson Line (Metro-North)|Hudson Line]] train of the day, leaving [[Poughkeepsie (Metro-North station)|Poughkeepsie]], the line's northern terminus, at its scheduled departure time of 5:54&nbsp;a.m. [[Eastern Standard Time (North America)|EST]].<ref name=\"current Metro-North schedule\">[[Metropolitan Transportation Authority]], {{cite web|url= http://web.mta.info/mnr/html/planning/schedules/pdf/NOV172013HUD-SS.pdf |title=Hudson Line weekend schedule|publisher=[[Metropolitan Transportation Authority]]|date= November 17, 2013|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131216041718/http://www.mta.info/mnr/html/planning/schedules/pdf/NOV172013HUD-SS.pdf|archivedate=December 16, 2013|accessdate=April 13, 2020}}</ref> It was powered by a [[GE Genesis|GE P32AC-DM]] [[dual-mode locomotive|locomotive]],<ref name=\"Rockefeller interview transcript\">{{cite web|title=Transcript of Interview 8808 Engineer|url=http://dms.ntsb.gov/public%2F55500-55999%2F55841%2F551511.pdf|publisher=[[National Transportation Safety Board]]|page=48|date=December 3, 2013|accessdate=October 31, 2014}}</ref> capable of running on either diesel fuel or electricity from a [[third rail]].

After a [[2008 Chatsworth train collision|2008 wreck]] in [[Los Angeles, California|Los Angeles]], the FRA mandated all American railroads implement PTC by 2015. Many resisted, complaining about the cost of the technology. Among those railroads were both MTA commuter railroads, Metro-North and the [[Long Island Rail Road]], which have sought to have that deadline extended until 2018. In the wake of the Spuyten Duyvil derailment, U.S. Rep. [[Sean Patrick Maloney]], a resident of [[Cold Spring, New York|Cold Spring]] whose neighbor James Lovell was one of those killed, introduced legislation to make low-interest loans and guarantees available so that commuter railroads like Metro-North could implement PTC.<ref name=\"FRA letter story\" /> Eventually other congressmembers from the lower Hudson Valley joined as cosponsors.<ref name=\"Journal News Deep Dive story\">{{cite news|last=Juva-Brown|first=Theresa|title=Bronx derailment: Grants program pushed for Metro-North|url=http://www.lohud.com/article/20131215/NEWS/312150049/Bronx-derailment-Grants-program-pushed-Metro-North-|newspaper=[[The Journal News]]|date=December 15, 2013|accessdate=December 18, 2013}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Metro-North crew installing speed restriction sign.jpg|thumb|left|Metro-North crews install speed-restriction sign on a stretch of the [[New Haven Line]] two weeks after the Spuyten Duyvil accident|alt=Four men in reflectorized orange vests and neon green helmets standing next to a set of four railroad tracks installing a signpost next to the track.

Instead they pointed to doubts about the technology's efficacy for large commuter rail networks. On a radio talk show following the crash, New York Governor [[Andrew Cuomo]] conceded that PTC is \"controversial ... [some people say] it's not what it's cracked up to be.\" The MTA itself said it was \"untested and unproven for commuter railroads [of our] size and complexity.\"<ref name=\"NYT alerter story\" />\n\nSeveral days later ''[[The New York Times]]'' reported that the train had a device known as an [[cab signalling#Cab signalling in the United States|alerter]]. It sounds an alarm when the train exceeds speed limits for 25 seconds and shuts it down after an additional 15 seconds if no action is taken by the engineer. It might have been able to prevent the accident; however it was in the locomotive, at the rear of the train, not the cab where Rockefeller was located.<ref name=\"NYT alerter story\" />\n\nWhile Metro-North used it only to prevent collisions, rail safety experts said it could easily be configured to force trains to slow down at curves such as Spuyten Duyvil, since it relied on signals sent through the rails themselves. It was also preferable to the traditional [[dead man's switch]] the cab was equipped with, which requires constant action and attention from the engineer. The MTA said it was considering doing so at 30 sites on the Metro-North and LIRR networks.<ref name=\"NYT alerter story\" /> On December 6, the FRA issued an emergency order requiring Metro-North to have two qualified crew members in the cab at any point where the speed limit drops by more than {{convert|20|mph}} until it installs that technology in cabs and at those sites.<ref name=\"FRA mandate story\" /> The next day Metro-North announced it was upgrading the signals at the Spuyten Duyvil curve and several others in the system; it would also lower the speed limit going into the curve so that it would be a less-than-20-mph drop and thus the extra engineer would not be necessary.<ref name=\"MTA changes story\">{{cite news|title=Safety Upgrades Coming to Metro-North Derailment Site: MTA|url=http://www.nbcnewyork.com/news/local/Safety-Upgrades-MTA-Metro-North-Train-Derailment-Bronx-Spuyten-Duyvil-Curve-234987791.html|newspaper=[[WNBC-TV]]|date=December 8, 2013|accessdate=December 8, 2013}}</ref> U.S. Senators [[Richard Blumenthal]] of Connecticut and [[Charles Schumer]] of New York called on Metro-North to install cameras to monitor both the track and the engineers.<ref name=\"Senators call for cameras\">{{cite news|last=Castillo|first=Alfonso A.|title=Senators call for train cameras to monitor engineer, track|url=http://www.newsday.com/long-island/senators-call-for-train-cameras-to-monitor-engineer-track-1.6564959|newspaper=[[Newsday]]|date=December 8, 2013|accessdate=December 9, 2013}}</ref>\n\nOn December 12, the FRA went further.

(1942)]]\n\n===Founding===\n\nCombustion Engineering was organized in 1912 through the merger of the Grieve Grate Company and the American Stoker Company, two well-known manufacturers of fuel burning equipment. The company was originally headquartered on [[Bowling Green Offices Building|11 Broadway]] and at 43 ''-'' 5 ''-'' 7 [[Broad Street (Manhattan)]], both in [[Lower Manhattan]].\nThe city block was leased from the Alliance Realty Company in April 1920. In May of the same year the firm began construction of an eight-story office building on the same site.<ref>''Alliance Realty Makes $3,000,000 Lease'', [[Wall Street Journal]], April 20, 1920, pg. 10.</ref>\n\nDuring the 1920s, C-E's signature boiler equipment was the English designed Type-E [[Boiler#Stoker Fired Boilers|stoker]]. C-E also offered several other types of underfeed stokers in addition to the Type-E. During the 1920s, all of C-E's stokers were fabricated in manufacturing plants along the [[Monongahela River]] south of [[Pittsburgh]].\n\nIn 1925 C-E entered the [[boiler|steam boiler]] business, beginning with a steam boiler installed at the [[Ford Motor Company|Ford Motor Company's]] [[River Rouge Plant]] in [[Dearborn, MI]]. C-E also acquired two boiler companies in [[Chattanooga, TN]] to augment its manufacturing capabilities. \n\nIn the 1970s C-E acquired the first 'Recycling Wire Granulation System' from a young entrepreneur/inventor and metallurgical engineer by the name of Charles Victor Paul Balo. The recycling wire granulation system was a large piece of machinery that took scrap wire from the phone companies and electric companies and extracted the alloy from the plastic or rubber coating quickly and automatically, separating the dross. The stripped alloy would go into a containment device and the dross would go into another. Both to be recycled, therefore avoiding the rapidly overflowing landfills.\n\n===Merger with the Superheater Company===\n\nDuring the [[Great Depression]], C-E formed a partnership with the Superheater Company. The Locomotive Superheater Company was founded in 1910 to further the use of [[superheater|superheated steam]] in [[Steam locomotive|locomotives]]. The Superheater Company's primary manufacturing facility was located in [[East Chicago, Indiana]].\n \nIn December 1948 stockholders approved a merger between the Combustion Engineering Company and Superheater Company. Following consolidation the corporation was called Combustion Engineering-Superheater Inc.<ref>''Merger of Combustion Engineering Co. With Superheater Approved'', Wall Street Journal, December 23, 1948, pg. 5.</ref> In September 1950 the firm announced plans to build a large high-pressure generating unit for [[Virginia Electric & Power Company]] in [[Chester, Virginia]].<ref>''Combustion Engineering To Build New Generator For Virginia Electric'', Wall Street Journal, September 21, 1950, pg. 8.</ref>\n\nIn 1953, the name Superheater was eliminated and the company took the more familiar name - Combustion Engineering, Inc. At this time, C-E primarily designed and built [[boiler|boiler assemblies]] for [[Power station|conventional power plants]]; those powered by [[coal]] and [[oil]].\n\nIn the mid-1950s, C-E also expanded its operations into oil and gas exploration, production, refining, and [[petrochemical]]s with the acquisition of the Lummus Company located in [[Bloomfield, New Jersey]].  Lummus also supplied small industrial steam supply systems for oil field enhanced recovery.\n\nC-E was one of the major suppliers of [[Water-tube boiler|boilers]] for [[United States Navy|US Navy]] [[steam turbine|steam-powered]] warships, including [[Liberty ship]]s during World War II. Amongst many other warships, all of the 46 {{sclass-|Knox|frigate}}s built during the 1960s and 1970s were equipped with a {{convert|1200|psi|lk=in|adj=on}} C-E power plant.\n\nC-E also was a leader in the development of large coal utility steam supply systems which were used worldwide. C-E pioneered the tangential firing process used in modern large pulverized coal utility boilers. C-E maintained a large coal burning test unit at the Windsor, Connecticut site which allowed the Power Systems Group to test changes to boiler air-flow and other critical boiler design factors.\n\n=== Growth of Nuclear Steam Supply Systems ===\n\nC-E's [[nuclear power]] activity began in 1955 under Arthur Santry Jr. The history of the C-E Windsor, Connecticut campus dates to the early development of the [[nuclear submarine]]. From the mid-1950s through the early 1960s, Combustion Engineering, under federal government contract, produced nuclear fuel for the US Navy's \"[[Nuclear Navy]]\" nuclear submarines. Also located at the Windsor site was the prototype marine [[nuclear propulsion]] training facility known as [[S1C reactor|S1C]], which was designed and constructed by C-E adjacent to its main campus. The S1C prototype was operated by C-E for more than ten years as an [[R&D]] and Naval training facility. After expiration of C-E's contract, the S1C contract was subsequently awarded to [[Knolls Atomic Power Laboratory]] (KAPL), who operated the unit until its decommissioning and dismantlement in the late 1990s and early 2000s.<ref>{{cite news | url=https://www.neoconveyors.com/products/chain-converyors | title=chain conveyors manufacturer in India| author=neoconveyors| date=April 13,2020| publisher=[[Neo Conveyors]] }}{{date=April 2020 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>\n\nIn the 1960s, C-E began selling [[nuclear power]] steam supply systems.  The first commercial nuclear steam supply system was sold to [[Consumers Power Company]] of Michigan for the [[Palisades Nuclear Generating Station]], which is still in operation (though scheduled to shut down permanently in 2022). C-E competed aggressively with [[General Electric]] and [[Westinghouse Electric Corporation|Westinghouse]] in this domain.\n\nIn the late 1960s the company supplied nuclear reactor systems and fabricated [[uranium]] fuel for [[electric utility]] companies. A joint venture was announced in April 1968, involving the Combustion Engineering Company, [[Houston Natural Gas]], and Ranchers Exploration & Development Corporation. The three businesses combined to search for uranium on {{convert|250000|acre|km2}} in [[New Mexico]].<ref>''Combustion Engineering To Join 2 Other Firms In a Hunt for Uranium'', Wall Street Journal, April 5, 1968, pg. 22.</ref>\n\nC-E was generally credited with a superior design, evidenced by the fact that the [[megawatt]] yield of its [[nuclear reactor]]s was typically about 10% higher than that of comparable Westinghouse plants.  The basis for this increase in efficiency was a computer-based system called the Core Operating Limit Supervisory System (COLSS) for design, and the Core Protection Calculator (CPC) for real-time control room operation<ref>http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.657.5580&rep=rep1&type=pdf</ref>, which leveraged almost 300 in-core [[neutron detector]]s and a patented [[algorithm]] to allow higher [[Power-to-weight ratio|power densities]]. {{Citation needed|date=July 2010}}  Combustion also fabricated a number of the Westinghouse reactor vessels and steam generators at its Chattanooga manufacturing facility under contracts with the Westinghouse company.\n\nC-E maintained a sophisticated nuclear reactor operator training simulator at the Windsor facility for support for customers of its nuclear steam supply systems.\n\n=== Company Structure & Organization ===\n\nIn the 1960s, and continuing through 1988, C-E acquired a number of companies, many not directly related to the core utility steam supply business.  As a result, the company structure evolved so that it had five and later six major business groups or divisions.  C-E Power Systems comprised the original utility steam supply components, C-E Industrial Group, C-E Lummus & Engineering Services Group, C-E Refractories & Minerals Group, C-E Oil & Gas Group, and last C-E Instrumentation & Controls Group were formed to provide management focus as the company and its products base expanded.  The Power Systems Division included the original major manufacturing facilities at Chattanooga, St. Louis, Monongahela, Birmingham; and in Canada, Brantford, Cornwall, and Upper Canada Manufacturing.  A number of companies were acquired or developed and added to the division including, American Pole Structures, C-E Controls, the P.F. Avery Co., C-E Impel, C-E Maguire (Charles A. Maguire & Associates) and C-E Metals (primarily a specialty scrap metal operation in Chattanooga); and was basically divided into three major sub-groups: Fossil, Nuclear, and Services (which included field erection, aftermarket spare parts, and engineering services). The Industrial Group included C-E Industrial Boiler (part of the original base of CE in East Chicago, IN and Detroit & Saginaw, MI), C-E Bauer (Pulp & Paper Equipment), C-E Raymond (Crushing and Conveying Equipment), C-E Air Preheater (Ljungstr\u00f6m\u00ae technology), C-E Tyler Screening (Industrial Wire Screens), C-E Ehrsham (Conveyors & Grain Elevators). C-E Enterprise Manufacturing, C-E Tyler Elevator, CERREY, and other industrial supply companies.  The Oil & Gas Group included such companies as C-E Natco, C-E Grey Tool, Beaumont Well Works, C-E Vetco, OilField Engineering, C-E Houston Forging, etc.  The Refractories & Minerals Group included C-E Minerals, C-E Refractories, C-E Cast Industrial Products, C-E Building Products (C-E Aluminum Building Products, C-E Morgan, C-E Stanley Artex), Georgia Kaolin, Pryor-Giggey, C-E Transport, C-E Glass, C-E Hordis Bros. Glass, etc.  The Instrumentation & Controls group included C-E Taylor Instruments, C-E Resource Recovery Systems, C-E Process Analytics (acquired from Bendix), et al.  Each group had a separate headquarters and support staff which coordinated each group's companies actions with the C-E Corporate support functions of Administration, Information Systems, Insurance, Treasury, Accounting, Audit, and Personnel.\n\nC-E had a large presence in Canada, including fossil and nuclear steam supply manufacturing facilities.  A number of the Industrial Group companies had manufacturing facilities there as well, primarily located in the province of Ontario.  The Oil & Gas Group had operations in the provinces of Alberta and Saskatchewan.  C-E maintained offices as well as a number of manufacturing sites on a worldwide basis, including the UK, Ireland, Austria, Germany, Italy, South Africa, Belgium, Mexico and France.  C-E's technology on a wide range of products was licensed worldwide.\n\n=== Leadership & Management ===\n\nFor much of the existence of the company, the Santry family controlled the management of C-E.  Joseph Santry was President of the company until 1963.  Arthur Santry, Jr., Joseph's nephew, was named President in 1963 and Chairman of the C-E Board of Directors in 1982 and held both titles until he resigned his post as President in 1984.  He remained as Chairman until 1988.  Charles Hugel was named President of C-E in 1984 and remained in that position until 1988 when he succeeded Mr. Santry as Chairman of the Board.  George Kimmel was named President and Chief Operating Officer in 1988 and remained in that position until the sale of the company to ABB in 1990.<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/1993/02/26/nyregion/arthur-j-santry-jr-74-is-dead-headed-combustion-engineering.html | work=The New York Times | first=Bruce | last=Lambert | title=Arthur J.

(1942)]]\n\n===Founding===\n\nCombustion Engineering was organized in 1912 through the merger of the Grieve Grate Company and the American Stoker Company, two well-known manufacturers of fuel burning equipment. The company was originally headquartered on [[Bowling Green Offices Building|11 Broadway]] and at 43 ''-'' 5 ''-'' 7 [[Broad Street (Manhattan)]], both in [[Lower Manhattan]].\nThe city block was leased from the Alliance Realty Company in April 1920. In May of the same year the firm began construction of an eight-story office building on the same site.<ref>''Alliance Realty Makes $3,000,000 Lease'', [[Wall Street Journal]], April 20, 1920, pg. 10.</ref>\n\nDuring the 1920s, C-E's signature boiler equipment was the English designed Type-E [[Boiler#Stoker Fired Boilers|stoker]]. C-E also offered several other types of underfeed stokers in addition to the Type-E. During the 1920s, all of C-E's stokers were fabricated in manufacturing plants along the [[Monongahela River]] south of [[Pittsburgh]].\n\nIn 1925 C-E entered the [[boiler|steam boiler]] business, beginning with a steam boiler installed at the [[Ford Motor Company|Ford Motor Company's]] [[River Rouge Plant]] in [[Dearborn, MI]]. C-E also acquired two boiler companies in [[Chattanooga, TN]] to augment its manufacturing capabilities. \n\nIn the 1970s C-E acquired the first 'Recycling Wire Granulation System' from a young entrepreneur/inventor and metallurgical engineer by the name of Charles Victor Paul Balo. The recycling wire granulation system was a large piece of machinery that took scrap wire from the phone companies and electric companies and extracted the alloy from the plastic or rubber coating quickly and automatically, separating the dross. The stripped alloy would go into a containment device and the dross would go into another. Both to be recycled, therefore avoiding the rapidly overflowing landfills.\n\n===Merger with the Superheater Company===\n\nDuring the [[Great Depression]], C-E formed a partnership with the Superheater Company. The Locomotive Superheater Company was founded in 1910 to further the use of [[superheater|superheated steam]] in [[Steam locomotive|locomotives]]. The Superheater Company's primary manufacturing facility was located in [[East Chicago, Indiana]].\n \nIn December 1948 stockholders approved a merger between the Combustion Engineering Company and Superheater Company. Following consolidation the corporation was called Combustion Engineering-Superheater Inc.<ref>''Merger of Combustion Engineering Co. With Superheater Approved'', Wall Street Journal, December 23, 1948, pg. 5.</ref> In September 1950 the firm announced plans to build a large high-pressure generating unit for [[Virginia Electric & Power Company]] in [[Chester, Virginia]].<ref>''Combustion Engineering To Build New Generator For Virginia Electric'', Wall Street Journal, September 21, 1950, pg. 8.</ref>\n\nIn 1953, the name Superheater was eliminated and the company took the more familiar name - Combustion Engineering, Inc.

Languages other than English may have [[loanword]]s based on either ''elevator'' or ''lift''. Because of wheelchair access laws, elevators are often a legal requirement in new multistory buildings, especially where wheelchair ramps would not be possible.\n\nThere are also some elevators which can go sideways in addition to the usual up-and-down motion.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.constructionweekonline.com/products-services/169354-germanys-thyssenkrupp-to-launch-revolutionary-rope-free-elevator-in-2022|title=This German company is inventing an elevator that goes sideways|website=Construction Week Online Middle East|access-date=20 February 2019}}</ref>\n{{TOC limit|3}}\n\n==History==\n\n===Pre-industrial era===\n[[File:Konrad Kyeser, Bellifortis, Clm 30150, Tafel 09, Blatt 38v (Ausschnitt).jpg|thumb|left|Elevator design by the German engineer [[Konrad Kyeser]] (1405)]]\n\nThe earliest known reference to an elevator is in the works of the Roman architect [[Vitruvius]], who reported that [[Archimedes]] (c. 287 BC \u2013 c. 212 BC) built his first elevator probably in 236 BC.<ref>\"[http://articles.sfgate.com/2008-08-23/home-and-garden/17125291_1_taller-buildings-elevator-elisha-graves-otis Laying the foundation for today's skyscrapers]\".

The invention of a system based on the [[Leadscrew|screw drive]] was perhaps the most important step in elevator technology since ancient times, leading to the creation of modern passenger elevators. The first screw drive elevator was built by [[Ivan Kulibin]] and installed in the [[Winter Palace]] in 1793, although there may have been an earlier design by [[Leonardo da Vinci]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=RO5PAAAAMAAJ&q=%22words+%22four+screws+lift+this%22%22&dq=%22words+%22four+screws+lift+this%22%22&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjHmq3y1pfoAhVERxUIHUdUAaoQ6AEIKTAA|title=Leonardo Da Vinci, Engineer and Architect|first1=Leonardo da|last1=Vinci|first2=Leonardo (da|last2=Vinci)|first3=Mus\u00e9e des|last3=Beaux-Arts (Montr\u00e9al)|first4=Pierre|last4=Th\u00e9berge|date=10 April 1987|publisher=Montreal Museum of Fine Arts|via=Google Books}}</ref> Several years later another of Kulibin's elevators was installed in the [[Arkhangelskoye Palace|Arkhangelskoye]] near [[Moscow]].\n\n===Industrial era===\nThe development of elevators was led by the need for movement of raw materials including [[coal]] and [[lumber]] from hillsides. The technology developed by these industries and the introduction of steel beam construction worked together to provide the passenger and freight elevators in use today.\n\nStarting in the coal mines, by the mid-19th century elevators were operated with [[steam power]] and were used for moving goods in bulk in mines and factories. These steam driven devices were soon being applied to a diverse set of purposes\u2014in 1823, two [[architect]]s working in [[London]], Burton and Hormer, built and operated a novel tourist attraction, which they called the \"ascending room\". It elevated paying customers to a considerable height in the center of London, allowing them a magnificent panoramic view of downtown.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://conveyor-tech.com/dictionary/catalog/10/index.html |title=Conveyor technology: Elevator |publisher=conveyor-tech.com |access-date=19 May 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080621145810/http://www.conveyor-tech.com/dictionary/catalog/10/index.html |archive-date=21 June 2008 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nEarly, crude steam-driven elevators were refined in the ensuing decade; in 1835, an innovative elevator called the \"Teagle\" was developed by the company Frost and Stutt in [[England]]. The elevator was belt-driven and used a [[counterweight]] for extra power.<ref>{{cite web |last=Bellis |first=Mary |url=http://inventors.about.com/od/estartinventions/a/Elevator.htm |title=Learn Who Invented the Elevator and More |website=Inventors.about.com |accessdate=26 April 2017}}</ref>\n\nThe hydraulic crane was invented by Sir [[William Armstrong, 1st Baron Armstrong|William Armstrong]] in 1846, primarily for use at the [[Tyneside]] docks for loading cargo. These quickly supplanted the earlier steam driven elevators: exploiting [[Pascal's law]], they provided a much greater force. A water pump supplied a variable level of [[water pressure]] to a plunger encased inside a vertical cylinder, allowing the level of the platform (carrying a heavy load) to be raised and lowered. Counterweights and balances were also used to increase the lifting power of the apparatus.\n\n[[Henry Waterman]] of New York is credited with inventing the \"standing rope control\" for an elevator in 1850.<ref Name=\"TheElevatorMuseumTimeline\">{{cite web |url=http://www.theelevatormuseum.org/timeline.php |title=EW Museum |website=Theelevatormuseum.org |access-date=26 April 2017}}</ref>\n\nIn 1845, the Neapolitan architect [[Gaetano Genovese]] installed in the [[Royal Palace of Caserta]] the \"Flying Chair\", an elevator ahead of its time, covered with chestnut wood outside and with maple wood inside. It included a light, two benches and a hand-operated signal, and could be activated from the outside, without any effort on the part of the occupants. Traction was controlled by a motor mechanic utilising a system of toothed wheels. A safety system was designed to take effect if the cords broke. It consisted of a beam pushed outwards by a steel spring.\n\n[[File:Elisha OTIS 1854.jpg|thumb|[[Elisha Otis]] demonstrating his safety system, [[New York Crystal Palace|Crystal Palace]], 1854]]\n\nIn 1852, [[Elisha Otis]] introduced the safety elevator, which prevented the fall of the cab if the cable broke.

An elevator is essentially a platform that is either pulled or pushed up by a mechanical means. A modern-day elevator consists of a cab (also called a \"cage\", \"carriage\" or \"car\") mounted on a platform within an enclosed space called a shaft or sometimes a \"hoistway\". In the past, elevator drive mechanisms were powered by steam and water hydraulic pistons or by hand. In a \"traction\" elevator, cars are pulled up by means of rolling steel ropes over a deeply grooved [[pulley]], commonly called a sheave in the industry. The weight of the car is balanced by a [[counterweight]]. Sometimes two elevators are built so that their cars always move synchronously in opposite directions, and are each other's counterweight.\n\nThe friction between the ropes and the pulley furnishes the traction which gives this type of elevator its name.\n\nHydraulic elevators use the principles of [[hydraulics]] (in the sense of [[fluid power|hydraulic power]]) to pressurise an above ground or in-ground piston to raise and lower the car (see ''Hydraulic elevators'' below). Roped hydraulics use a combination of both ropes and hydraulic power to raise and lower cars. Recent innovations include permanent magnet motors, machine room-less rail mounted gearless machines, and microprocessor controls.\n\nThe technology used in new installations depends on a variety of factors. Hydraulic elevators are cheaper, but installing cylinders greater than a certain length becomes impractical for very-high lift hoistways. For buildings of much over seven floors, traction elevators must be employed instead. Hydraulic elevators are usually slower than traction elevators.\n\nElevators are a candidate for [[mass customisation]].\nThere are economies to be made from [[mass production]] of the components, but each building comes with its own requirements like different number of floors, dimensions of the well and usage patterns.\n\n===Doors===\n{{unsourced section|date=March 2020}}\nElevator [[doors]] prevent riders from falling into, entering, or tampering with anything in the shaft. The most common configuration is to have two panels that meet in the middle, and slide open laterally. In a cascading telescopic configuration (potentially allowing wider entryways within limited space), the doors roll on independent tracks so that while open, they are tucked behind one another, and while closed, they form cascading layers on one side. This can be configured so that two sets of such cascading doors operate like the center opening doors described above, allowing for a very wide elevator cab. In less expensive installations the elevator can also use one large \"slab\" door: a single panel door the width of the doorway that opens to the left or right laterally. Some buildings have elevators with the single door on the shaftway, and double cascading doors on the cab.\n\n===Machine room-less (MRL) elevators===\n{{unsourced section|date=March 2020}}\n[[File:Kone EcoDisc.jpg|thumb|Kone EcoDisc. The entire drive system is in the hoistway]]\nMachine room-less elevators are designed so that most of the components fit within the shaft containing the elevator car; and a small cabinet houses the elevator controller. Other than the machinery being in the hoistway, the equipment is similar to a normal traction or hole-less hydraulic elevator. The world's first machine room-less elevator, the Kone MonoSpace was introduced in 1996, by [[Kone]]. The benefits are:\n* creates more usable space\n* use less energy (70\u201380% less than standard hydraulic elevators)\n* uses no oil (assuming it is a traction elevator)\n* all components are above ground similar to roped hydraulic type elevators (this takes away the environmental concern that was created by the [[hydraulic cylinder]] on direct hydraulic type elevators being stored underground)\n* slightly lower cost than other elevators; significantly so for the hydraulic MRL elevator\n* can operate at faster speeds than hydraulics but not normal traction units.\n\n====Detriments====\n{{unsourced section|date=March 2020}}\n* Equipment can be harder, and significantly more dangerous to service and maintain.\n\n====Facts====\n* Noise level is at 50\u201355 dBA ([[A-weighted]] [[decibels]]), which can be lower than some but not all types of elevators.\n* Usually used for [[low-rise]] to mid-rise buildings\n* The motor mechanism is placed in the hoistway itself\n* The US was slow to accept the commercial MRL Elevator because of codes\n* National and local building codes did not address elevators without machine rooms. Residential MRL elevators are still not allowed by the ASME A17 code in the US. MRL elevators have been recognised in the 2005 supplement to the 2004 A17.1 Elevator Code.\n* Today, some machine room-less hydraulic elevators by Otis and ThyssenKrupp exist; they do not involve the use of a piston located underground or a machine room, mitigating environmental concerns; however, code is not yet accepting of them in all parts of the United States.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://thyssenkruppelevator.com/elevator-products/enduraMRL |title=enduraMRL &#124; thyssenkrupp Elevators Escalators Moving Walks &#124; Installation Service Modernization |website=Thyssenkruppelevator.com |accessdate=26 April 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.otis.com/site/us/Pages/HydroFitProductPage.aspx |title=Hydrofit \u2013 Hydraulic Elevator-Machine-Roomless\u2013Otis Elevator\u2013 USA HydroFitProductPage |website=Otis.com |accessdate=26 April 2017}}</ref>\n\n===Double-decker elevators===\n{{main|Double-deck elevator}}\nDouble-decker elevators are traction elevators with cars that have an upper and lower deck.

Geared machines use [[worm gear]]s to control mechanical movement of elevator cars by \"rolling\" steel hoist ropes over a drive sheave which is attached to a [[gearbox]] driven by a high-speed motor. These machines are generally the best option for basement or overhead traction use for speeds up to {{convert|500|ft/min|m/s|0|order=flip|abbr=on}}.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://acelifts.com/news/traction-lifts-work/ |title=Traction Lifts: an infographic on how they work |author=ACE Lifts |work=ACE Lifts}}</ref>\n\nHistorically, AC motors were used for single or double-speed elevator machines on the grounds of cost and lower usage applications where car speed and passenger comfort were less of an issue, but for higher speed, larger capacity elevators, the need for infinitely variable speed control over the traction machine becomes an issue. Therefore, DC machines powered by an AC/DC [[Motor\u2013generator|motor generator]] were the preferred solution. The [[Motor\u2013generator|MG set]] also typically powered the [[relay logic|relay]] controller of the elevator, which has the added advantage of electrically isolating the elevators from the rest of a building's electrical system, thus eliminating the transient power spikes in the building's electrical supply caused by the motors starting and stopping (causing lighting to dim every time the elevators are used for example), as well as interference to other electrical equipment caused by the arcing of the relay contactors in the control system.\n\nThe widespread availability of variable frequency AC drives has allowed AC motors to be used universally, bringing with it the advantages of the older motor-generator, DC-based systems, without the penalties in terms of efficiency and complexity. The older MG-based installations are gradually being replaced in older buildings due to their poor energy efficiency.\n\nGearless traction machines are low-speed (low-RPM), high-[[torque]] electric motors powered either by AC or DC. In this case, the drive sheave is directly attached to the end of the motor. Gearless traction elevators can reach speeds of up to {{convert|4000|ft/min|m/s|0|order=flip|abbr=on}}, A brake is mounted between the motor and gearbox or between the motor and drive sheave or at the end of the drive sheave to hold the elevator stationary at a floor. This brake is usually an external [[drum brake|drum type]] and is actuated by spring force and held open electrically; a power failure will cause the brake to engage and prevent the elevator from falling (see [[inherent safety]] and [[safety engineering]]). But it can also be some form of [[disc brake|disc type]] like 1 or more calipers over a disc in one end of the motor shaft or drive sheave which is used in high speed, high rise and large capacity elevators with machine rooms(an exception is the Kone MonoSpace's EcoDisc which is not high speed, high rise and large capacity and is machine room less but it uses the same design as is a thinner version of a conventional gearless traction machine) for braking power, compactness and [[redundancy (engineering)|redundancy]] (assuming there's at least 2 calipers on the disc), or 1 or more disc brakes with a single caliper at one end of the motor shaft or drive sheave which is used in machine room less elevators for compactness, braking power, and [[redundancy (engineering)|redundancy]] (assuming there's 2 brakes or more).\n\nIn each case, cables are attached to a hitch plate on top of the cab or may be \"underslung\" below a cab, and then looped over the drive sheave to a [[counterweight]] attached to the opposite end of the cables which reduces the amount of [[power (physics)|power]] needed to move the cab. The counterweight is located in the hoist-way and is carried along a separate railway system; as the car goes up, the counterweight goes down, and vice versa. This action is powered by the traction machine which is directed by the controller, typically a relay logic or computerised device that directs starting, [[acceleration]], [[deceleration]] and stopping of the elevator cab. The weight of the counterweight is typically equal to the weight of the elevator cab plus 40\u201350% of the capacity of the elevator. The grooves in the drive sheave are specially designed to prevent the cables from slipping. \"[[Traction (engineering)|Traction]]\" is provided to the ropes by the grip of the grooves in the sheave, thereby the name. As the ropes age and the traction grooves wear, some traction is lost and the ropes must be replaced and the sheave repaired or replaced. Sheave and rope wear may be significantly reduced by ensuring that all ropes have equal tension, thus sharing the load evenly. Rope tension equalisation may be achieved using a rope tension gauge, and is a simple way to extend the lifetime of the sheaves and ropes.\n\nElevators with more than {{convert|30|m|0|abbr=on}} of travel have a system called compensation. This is a separate set of cables or a chain attached to the bottom of the counterweight and the bottom of the elevator cab. This makes it easier to control the elevator, as it compensates for the differing weight of cable between the hoist and the cab. If the elevator cab is at the top of the hoist-way, there is a short length of hoist cable above the car and a long length of compensating cable below the car and vice versa for the counterweight. If the compensation system uses cables, there will be an additional sheave in the pit below the elevator, to guide the cables. If the compensation system uses chains, the chain is guided by a bar mounted between the counterweight tracks.\n\n===Regenerative drives===\nAnother energy-saving improvement is the regenerative drive,<ref>Debbie Sniderman, [https://www.asme.org/engineering-topics/articles/elevators/energy-efficient-elevator-technologies \"Energy Efficient Elevator Technologies\"], American Society of Mechanical Engineers ASME Sept. 2012</ref> which works analogously to [[regenerative braking]] in vehicles, using the elevator's electric motor as a generator to capture some of the gravitational potential energy of descent of a full cab (heavier than its counterweight) or ascent of an empty cab (lighter than its counterweight) and return it to the building's electrical system.\n\n===Hydraulic elevators===\n[[File:Elevator hydraulic.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Pit of a hydraulic scenic elevator with metal grating on bottom. This elevator travels 7 stories.]]\n* ''Conventional hydraulic elevators''. They use an underground [[hydraulic cylinder]], are quite common for low level buildings with two to five floors (sometimes but seldom up to six to eight floors), and have speeds of up to {{convert|200|ft/min|m/s|0|order=flip|abbr=on}}. For higher rise applications, a telescopic hydraulic cylinder can be used.{{citation needed|reason=Hydraulic elevators with telescoping shafts are common, especially in 'holeless' or 'reduced depth hole' designs, but if there are any applications above about eight stories, this needs a cite|date=May 2016}}\n* ''Holeless hydraulic elevators'' were developed in the 1970s, and use a pair of above ground cylinders, which makes it practical for environmentally or cost sensitive buildings with two, three, or four floors.\n* ''Roped hydraulic elevators'' use both above ground cylinders and a rope system, allowing the elevator to travel further than the piston has to move.\n\nThe low mechanical complexity of hydraulic elevators in comparison to traction elevators makes them ideal for low rise, low traffic installations. They are less energy efficient as the pump works against gravity to push the car and its passengers upwards; this energy is lost when the car descends on its own weight. The high current draw of the pump when starting up also places higher demands on a building's electrical system. There are also environmental concerns should the lifting cylinder leak fluid into the ground.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://science.howstuffworks.com/transport/engines-equipment/elevator1.htm |title=How Elevators Work: Hydraulic Elevators |author=Harris, Tom |publisher=[[HowStuffWorks]]|date=12 February 2002 }}</ref>\n\nThe modern generation of low-cost, machine room-less traction elevators made possible by advances in [[miniaturisation]] of the traction motor and control systems challenges the supremacy of the hydraulic elevator in their traditional market niche.{{Citation needed|date=February 2019}}\n\n===Electromagnetic propulsion===\nCable-free elevators using [[electromagnetic propulsion]], capable of moving both vertically and horizontally, have been developed by German engineering firm [[Thyssen Krupp]] for use in high rise, high density buildings.<ref>{{cite web|title=MULTI \u2013 Rope-free elevator system \u2013 thyssenkrupp Elevator|url=https://multi.thyssenkrupp-elevator.com/en/|website=multi.thyssenkrupp-elevator.com|publisher=[[Thyssen Krupp]]|accessdate=19 October 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190119034447/https://multi.thyssenkrupp-elevator.com/en/|archive-date=19 January 2019|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last1=Condliffe|first1=Jamie|title=Meet the world's first cable-free elevator\u2014it can zoom horizontally or vertically|url=https://www.technologyreview.com/s/608167/worlds-first-cable-free-elevator-zooms-horizontally-and-vertically-using-maglev-tech/|website=MIT Technology Review|publisher=[[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]]|accessdate=19 October 2017|language=en}}</ref>\n\n===Climbing elevator===\n{{unsourced section|date=March 2020}}\nA climbing elevator is a self-ascending elevator with its own propulsion. The propulsion can be done by an electric or a combustion engine. Climbing elevators are used in guyed masts or towers, in order to make easy access to parts of these constructions, such as flight safety lamps for maintenance. An example would be the [[moonlight tower]]s in Austin, Texas, where the elevator holds only one person and equipment for maintenance. The [[Glasgow Tower]]&nbsp;\u2014 an observation tower in [[Glasgow]], [[Scotland]]&nbsp;\u2014 also makes use of two climbing elevators.  Temporary climbing elevators are commonly used in the construction of new high-rise buildings to move materials and personnel before the building's permanent elevator system is installed, at which point the climbing elevators are dismantled.\n\n===Pneumatic elevator===\nAn elevator of this kind uses a vacuum on top of the cab and a valve on the top of the \"shaft\" to move the cab upwards and closes the valve in order to keep the cab at the same level. A diaphragm or a piston is used as a \"brake\", if there's a sudden increase in pressure above the cab. To go down, it opens the valve so that the air can pressurise the top of the \"shaft\", allowing the cab to go down by its own weight. This also means that in case of a power failure, the cab will automatically go down. The \"shaft\" is made of acrylic, and is always round due to the shape of the vacuum pump turbine. To keep the air inside of the cab, rubber seals are used. Due to technical limitations, these elevators have a low capacity, they usually allow 1\u20133 passengers and up to 525&nbsp;lbs.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Knight|first1=Will|title=Vacuum elevator gives users a gentle lift|url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn7353-vacuum-elevator-gives-users-a-gentle-lift/|website=[[New Scientist]]|accessdate=23 November 2017|date=6 May 2005}}</ref>\n\n==Controls==\n\n===Manual controls===\n{{unsourced section|date=March 2020}}\n[[File:OtisControl.jpg|thumb|Otis 1920s controller, operational in a New York City apartment building]]\nIn the first half of the twentieth century, almost all elevators had no automatic positioning of the floor on which the cab would stop. Some of the older freight elevators were controlled by switches operated by pulling on adjacent ropes. In general, most elevators before WWII were manually controlled by [[elevator operator]]s using a [[rheostat]] connected to the motor. This rheostat (see picture) was enclosed within a cylindrical container about the size and shape of a cake. This was mounted upright or sideways on the cab wall and operated via a projecting handle, which was able to slide around the top half of the cylinder.\n\nThe elevator motor was located at the top of the shaft or beside the bottom of the shaft. Pushing the handle forward would cause the cab to rise; backwards would make it sink. The harder the pressure, the faster the elevator would move. The handle also served as a [[dead man switch]]: if the operator let go of the handle, it would return to its upright position, causing the elevator cab to stop. In time, safety interlocks would ensure that the inner and outer doors were closed before the elevator was allowed to move.\n\nThis lever would allow some control over the energy supplied to the motor and so enabled the elevator to be accurately positioned&nbsp;\u2014 if the operator was sufficiently skilled. More typically, the operator would have to \"jog\" the control, moving the cab in small increments until the elevator was reasonably close to the landing point. Then the operator would direct the outgoing and incoming passengers to \"watch the step\".\n[[File:mit-old-elevator-panel.jpg|thumb|Manual pushbutton elevator controls]]\n\nAutomatic elevators began to appear as early as the 1920s,{{citation needed|date=August 2016}} their development being hastened by [[strike action|striking]] elevator operators which brought large cities dependent on skyscrapers (and therefore their elevators) such as New York and Chicago to their knees. Self service elevators were not allowed in New York City until 1922.  Prior to this, non-luxury buildings that could not afford an attendant were built as five-story walk ups.  These electromechanical systems used [[relay logic]] circuits of increasing complexity to control the speed, position and door operation of an elevator or bank of elevators.\n\nThe Otis ''Autotronic'' system of the early 1950s brought the earliest predictive systems which could anticipate traffic patterns within a building to deploy elevator movement in the most efficient manner. Relay-controlled elevator systems remained common until the 1980s and their gradual replacement with solid-state, [[microprocessor]]-based controls are now the industry standard. Most older, manually-operated elevators have been retrofitted with automatic or semi-automatic controls.\n\n[[File:Dover elevator button.jpg|thumb|Typical freight elevator control station]]\n[[File:Dover Impulse at Bob's Furniture - Nashua, NH.jpg|thumb|Typical passenger elevator control station]]\n[[File:Ringing the elevator alarm.jpg|thumb|Using the emergency call button in an elevator.

Some of these may be key switches (to control access). In some elevators, certain floors are inaccessible unless one swipes a security card or enters a passcode (or both).\n** Door open and door close buttons.\n\nThe operation of the door open button is transparent, immediately opening and holding the door, typically until a timeout occurs and the door closes.

In this case (hastening normal closure), the door close button has no effect. However, the door close button will cause a hall call to be ignored (so the door won't reopen), and once the timeout has expired, the door close will immediately close the door, for example to cancel a door open push. The minimum timeout for automatic door closing in the US is 5 seconds,<ref>ASME A17.1 \u2013 2000, Safety Code for Elevators and Escalators, Requirements 4.10.7 \u2013 Door and Signal Timing for Hall Calls, \"The minimum acceptable notification time shall be 5 seconds.\"</ref> which is a noticeable delay if not over-ridden.\n* An alarm button or switch, which passengers can use to warn the premises manager that they have been trapped in the elevator.\n* A set of doors kept locked on each floor to prevent unintentional access into the elevator shaft by the unsuspecting individual. The door is unlocked and opened by a machine sitting on the roof of the car, which also drives the doors that travel with the car. Door controls are provided to close immediately or reopen the doors, although the button to close them immediately is often disabled during normal operations, especially on more recent elevators. Objects in the path of the moving doors will either be detected by sensors or physically activate a switch that reopens the doors. Otherwise, the doors will close after a preset time. Some elevators are configured to remain open at the floor until they are required to move again.  Regulations often require doors to close after use to prevent smoke from entering the elevator shaft in event of fire.\n* Elevators in high traffic buildings often have a \"nudge\" function (the Otis ''Autotronic'' system first introduced this feature){{citation needed|date=March 2020}} which will close the doors at a reduced speed, and sound a buzzer if the \"door open\" button is being deliberately held down, or if the door sensors have been blocked for too long a time.\n* A stop switch (not allowed under British regulations{{Citation needed|date=May 2018}}) to halt the elevator while in motion and often used to hold an elevator open while freight is loaded. Keeping an elevator stopped for too long may set off an alarm. Unless local codes require otherwise, this will most likely be a [[key switch]].\n\nSome elevators may have one or more of the following:\n* An [[Emergency telephone|elevator telephone]], which can be used (in addition to the alarm) by a trapped passenger to call for help. This may consist of a transceiver, or simply a button.  This feature is often required by local regulations.\n* Hold button: This button delays the door closing timer, useful for loading freight and hospital beds.\n* Call cancellation: A destination floor may be deselected by double clicking.\n* Access restriction by key switches, RFID reader, code keypad, hotel room card, etc.\n* One or more additional sets of doors. This is primarily used to serve different floor plans: on each floor only one set of doors opens. For example, in an elevated crosswalk setup, the front doors may open on the street level, and the rear doors open on the crosswalk level. This is also common in garages, rail stations, and airports. Alternatively, both doors may open on a given floor. This is sometimes timed so that one side opens first for getting off, and then the other side opens for getting on, to improve boarding/exiting speed. This is particularly useful when passengers have luggage or carts, as at an airport, due to reduced manoeuvrability.\n**[[File:Dual elevator door buttons - cropped.jpg|thumb|Dual door open and door close buttons, in an elevator with two sets of doors.]] In case of dual doors, there may be two sets of door open and door close buttons, with one pair controlling the front doors, from the perspective of the console, typically denoted &lt;&gt; and &gt;&lt;, with the other pair controlling the rear doors, typically denoted with a line in the middle, <nowiki>&lt;|&gt; and &gt;|&lt;</nowiki>, or double lines, <nowiki>|&lt;&gt;| and &gt;||&lt;</nowiki>.

The door should stay open while parked on a floor. This mode may be used for temporarily transporting goods.\n* Attendant service mode\n* Large buildings with multiple elevators of this type also had an ''elevator dispatcher'' stationed in the lobby to direct passengers and to signal the operator to leave with the use of a mechanical \"cricket\" noisemaker.\n\n===External controls===\n[[File:External lift control panel.jpg|thumb|An external control panel]]\n\nElevators are typically controlled from the outside by a call box, which has up and down buttons, at each stop. When pressed at a certain floor, the button (also known as a \"hall call\" button) calls the elevator to pick up more passengers. If the particular elevator is currently serving traffic in a certain direction, it will only answer calls in the same direction unless there are no more calls beyond that floor.\n\nIn a group of two or more elevators, the call buttons may be linked to a central dispatch computer, such that they illuminate and cancel together. This is done to ensure that only one car is called at one time.\n\nKey switches may be installed on the ground floor so that the elevator can be remotely switched on or off from the outside.\n\nIn destination control systems, one selects the intended destination floor (in lieu of pressing ''\"up\"'' or ''\"down\"'') and is then notified which elevator will serve their request.\n\n===Floor numbering===\n[[File:Missing Floor 13.jpg|thumb|Elevator buttons showing the missing [[Thirteenth floor|13th floor]]]]\n{{further|Floor numbering}}\n{{empty section|date=March 2020}}\n===Elevator algorithm===\nThe [[elevator algorithm]], a simple [[algorithm]] by which a single elevator can decide where to stop, is summarised as follows:\n* Continue travelling in the same direction while there are remaining requests in that same direction.\n* If there are no further requests in that direction, then stop and become idle, or change direction if there are requests in the opposite direction.\nThe elevator algorithm has found an application in computer [[operating system]]s as an algorithm for scheduling [[hard disk]] requests.\nModern elevators use more complex [[heuristic (computer science)|heuristic algorithms]] to decide which request to service next. An introduction to these algorithms can be found in the \"Elevator traffic handbook: theory and practice\" given in the references below.\n\n===Destination control system===\n{{main|Destination dispatch}}\n[[File:Destination control elevator floor selection.jpg|thumb|A destination control elevator floor selection panel at [[Northeastern University]] in Boston, United States]]\nSome skyscraper buildings and other types of installation feature a destination operating panel where a passenger registers their floor calls before entering the car. The system lets them know which car to wait for, instead of everyone boarding the next car. In this way, travel time is reduced as the elevator makes fewer stops for individual passengers, and the computer distributes adjacent stops to different cars in the bank. Although travel time is reduced, passenger waiting times may be longer as they will not necessarily be allocated the next car to depart. During the down peak period the benefit of destination control will be limited as passengers have a common destination.\n\nIt can also improve accessibility, as a mobility-impaired passenger can move to his or her designated car in advance.\n\nInside the elevator there is no call button to push, or the buttons are there but they cannot be pushed&nbsp;\u2014 except door opening and alarm button&nbsp;\u2014 they only indicate stopping floors.\n\nThe idea of destination control was originally conceived by [[Leo Port]] from Sydney in 1961,<ref>Port, L.W. (1961), Elevator System Commonwealth of Australia Patent Specification, Application Number 1421/61, 14 February 1961</ref> but at that time elevator controllers were implemented in relays and were unable to optimise the performance of destination control allocations.\n\nThe system was first pioneered by [[Schindler Group|Schindler Elevator]] in 1992 as the Miconic 10. Manufacturers of such systems claim that average travelling time can be reduced by up to 30%.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www6.schindler.com/SEC/websecen.nsf/pages/elev-MHR-Mic10-01 |title=Schindler Elevators, Escalators, Moving Walks Service Mod Company |website=Schindler.com |access-date=26 April 2017}}</ref>\n\nHowever, performance enhancements cannot be generalised as the benefits and limitations of the system are dependent on many factors.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.peters-research.com/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=100%3Aunderstanding-the-benefits-and-limitations-of-destination-control&catid=3%3Apapers&Itemid=1 |title=Peters Research Ltd |author=Richard Peters |work=peters-research.com}}</ref> One problem is that the system is subject to gaming. Sometimes, one person enters the destination for a large group of people going to the same floor. The dispatching [[algorithm]] is usually unable to completely cater for the variation, and latecomers may find the elevator they are assigned to is already full. Also, occasionally, one person may press the floor multiple times. This is common with up/down buttons when people believe this to be an effective way to hurry elevators. However, this will make the computer think multiple people are waiting and will allocate empty cars to serve this one person.\n\nTo prevent this problem, in one implementation of destination control, every user is given an [[RFID]] card, for identification and tracking, so that the system knows every user call and can cancel the first call if the passenger decides to travel to another destination, preventing empty calls. The newest invention knows even where people are located and how many on which floor because of their identification, either for the purposes of evacuating the building or for security reasons.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.theporttechnology.com/page/systemoperation.html |title=The PORT Technology :: System Operation |work=theporttechnology.com}}</ref> Another way to prevent this issue is to treat everyone travelling from one floor to another as one group and to allocate only one car for that group.\n\nThe same destination scheduling concept can also be applied to public transit such as in [[group rapid transit]].\n[[File:DestinationDispatchElevator.jpg|thumb|upright|A [[destination dispatch]] control station, outside of the car, on which the user presses a button to indicate the desired destination floor, and the panel indicates which car will be dispatched]]\n\n==Special operating modes==\n{{more citations needed section|date=March 2020}}\n===Anti-crime protection===\nThe anti-crime protection (ACP) feature will force each car to stop at a pre-defined landing and open its doors. This allows a security guard or a receptionist at the landing to visually inspect the passengers. The car stops at this landing as it passes to serve further demand.\n\n===Up peak===\nDuring up-peak mode (also called moderate incoming traffic), elevator cars in a group are recalled to the lobby to provide expeditious service to passengers arriving at the building, most typically in the morning as people arrive for work or at the conclusion of a lunch-time period when people are going back to work. Elevators are dispatched one-by-one when they reach a pre-determined passenger load, or when they have had their doors opened for a certain period of time. The next elevator to be dispatched usually has its hall lantern or a \"this car leaving next\" sign illuminated to encourage passengers to make maximum use of the available elevator system capacity. Some elevator banks are programmed so that at least one car will always return to the lobby floor and park whenever it becomes free.\n\nThe commencement of up-peak may be triggered by a time clock, by the departure of a certain number of fully loaded cars leaving the lobby within a given time period, or by a switch manually operated by a building attendant.\n\n===Down peak===\nDuring down-peak mode, elevator cars in a group are sent away from the lobby towards the highest floor served, after which they commence running down the floors in response to hall calls placed by passengers wishing to leave the building. This allows the elevator system to provide maximum passenger handling capacity for people leaving the building.\n\nThe commencement of down-peak may be triggered by a time clock, by the arrival of a certain number of fully loaded cars at the lobby within a given time period, or by a switch manually operated by a building attendant.\n\n===Sabbath service===\n[[File:Sabbath on-off.jpg|thumb|upright|left|A switch to turn Sabbath elevator mode on or off]]\n\nIn areas with large populations of observant [[Jew]]s or in facilities catering to Jews, one may find a \"[[Sabbath elevator]]\". In this mode, an elevator will stop automatically at every floor, allowing people to step on and off without having to push any buttons. This prevents violation of the [[Shabbat|Sabbath]] prohibition against operating electrical devices when Sabbath is in effect for those who observe this ritual.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://ohr.edu/ask_db/ask_main.php/39/Q1/ |title=Shabbat Elevators |work=Ohr Somayach}}</ref>\n\nHowever, Sabbath mode has the side effect of using considerable amounts of energy, running the elevator car sequentially up and down every floor of a building, repeatedly servicing floors where it is not needed. For a tall building with many floors, the car must move on a frequent enough basis so as to not cause undue delay for potential users that will not touch the controls as it opens the doors on every floor up the building.\n\nSome taller buildings may have the Sabbath elevator alternate floors in order to save time and energy; for example, an elevator may stop at only even-numbered floors on the way up, and then the odd-numbered floors on the way down.\n\n===Independent service===\nIndependent service or car preference is a special mode found on most elevators. It is activated by a key switch either inside the elevator itself or on a centralised control panel in the lobby. When an elevator is placed on this mode, it will no longer respond to hall calls. (In a bank of elevators, traffic is rerouted to the other elevators, while in a single elevator, the hall buttons are disabled). The elevator will remain parked on a floor with its doors open until a floor is selected and the door close button is held until the elevator starts to travel. Independent service is useful when transporting large goods or moving groups of people between certain floors.\n\n===Inspection service===\nInspection service is designed to provide access to the hoistway and car top for inspection and maintenance purposes by qualified elevator mechanics. It is first activated by a key switch on the car operating panel usually labelled 'Inspection', 'Car Top', 'Access Enable' or 'HWENAB' (short for HoistWay access ENABled). When this switch is activated the elevator will come to a stop if moving, car calls will be cancelled (and the buttons disabled), and hall calls will be assigned to other elevator cars in the group (or cancelled in a single elevator configuration). The elevator can now only be moved by the corresponding 'Access' key switches, usually located at the highest (to access the top of the car) and lowest (to access the elevator pit) landings. The access key switches will allow the car to move at reduced inspection speed with the hoistway door open. This speed can range from anywhere up to 60% of normal operating speed on most controllers, and is usually defined by local safety codes.\n\nElevators have a car top inspection station that allows the car to be operated by a mechanic in order to move it through the hoistway. Generally, there are three buttons: UP, RUN, and DOWN. Both the RUN and a direction button must be held to move the car in that direction, and the elevator will stop moving as soon as the buttons are released. Most other elevators have an up/down toggle switch and a RUN button. The inspection panel also has standard power outlets for work lamps and powered tools.\n\n===Fire service===\nDepending on the location of the elevator, fire service code will vary state to state and country to country. Fire service is usually split up into two modes: phase one and phase two. These are separate modes that the elevator can go into.\n\nPhase one mode is activated by a corresponding smoke sensor or heat sensor in the building. Once an alarm has been activated, the elevator will automatically go into phase one. The elevator will wait an amount of time, then proceed to go into nudging mode to tell everyone the elevator is leaving the floor. Once the elevator has left the floor, depending on where the alarm was set off, the elevator will go to the fire-recall floor. However, if the alarm was activated on the fire-recall floor, the elevator will have an alternate floor to recall to. When the elevator is recalled, it proceeds to the recall floor and stops with its doors open. The elevator will no longer respond to calls or move in any direction. Located on the fire-recall floor is a fire-service key switch. The fire-service key switch has the ability to turn fire service off, turn fire service on or to bypass fire service. The only way to return the elevator to normal service is to switch it to bypass after the alarms have reset.\n\n[[File:KONE Ecodisc Elevator in Fireman's Mode.jpg|thumb|KONE Ecodisc elevator in fireman's mode]]\n\nPhase-two mode can only be activated by a key switch located inside the elevator on the centralised control panel. This mode was created for firefighters so that they may rescue people from a burning building. The phase-two key switch located on the COP has three positions: off, on, and hold. By turning phase two on, the firefighter enables the car to move. However, like independent-service mode, the car will not respond to a car call unless the firefighter manually pushes and holds the door close button. Once the elevator gets to the desired floor it will not open its doors unless the firefighter holds the door open button. This is in case the floor is burning and the firefighter can feel the heat and knows not to open the door. The firefighter must hold the door open button until the door is completely opened. If for any reason the firefighter wishes to leave the elevator, they will use the hold position on the key switch to make sure the elevator remains at that floor. If the firefighter wishes to return to the recall floor, they simply turn the key off and close the doors.\n\n===Medical emergency or code-blue service===\nCommonly found in hospitals, code-blue service allows an elevator to be summoned to any floor for use in an emergency situation. Each floor will have a code-blue recall key switch, and when activated, the elevator system will immediately select the elevator car that can respond the fastest, regardless of direction of travel and passenger load. Passengers inside the elevator will be notified with an alarm and indicator light to exit the elevator when the doors open.\n\nOnce the elevator arrives at the floor, it will park with its doors open and the car buttons will be disabled to prevent a passenger from taking control of the elevator. Medical personnel must then activate the code-blue key switch inside the car, select their floor and close the doors with the door close button. The elevator will then travel non-stop to the selected floor, and will remain in code-blue service until switched off in the car. Some hospital elevators will feature a 'hold' position on the code-blue key switch (similar to fire service) which allows the elevator to remain at a floor locked out of service until code blue is deactivated.\n\n===Riot mode===\nIn the event of civil disturbance, insurrection, or rioting, management can prevent elevators from stopping at the lobby or parking areas, preventing undesired persons from using the elevators while still allowing the building tenants to use them within the rest of the building.\n\n===Emergency power operation===\nMany elevator installations now feature emergency power systems such as [[uninterruptible power supply]] (UPS) which allow elevator use in blackout situations and prevent people from becoming trapped in elevators. To be compliant with BS 9999 safety standards, a passenger lift being used in an emergency situation must have a secondary source of power. In many cases, providing a secondary mains feed simply isn't possible, so a UPS and or generator combination is used instead.<ref name=\"powercontrol.co.uk\">{{Cite web | url=https://powercontrol.co.uk/blog/ups-emergency-lifts/ |title = Secondary Power Supplies for Emergency Evacuation Lifts}}</ref>\n\nWhere a generator is being used as the secondary power supply in a hospital, a UPS must also be present to meet regulations stating that healthcare facilities must test their emergency generators under load at least once per month. During the test period only one supply of power is feeding the lift, in a blackout situation without a UPS, the lifts would not be operational.<ref name=\"powercontrol.co.uk\"/>\n\n====Traction elevators====\n{{unsourced section|date=March 2020}}\nWhen power is lost in a traction elevator system, all elevators will initially come to a halt. One by one, each car in the group will return to the lobby floor, open its doors, and shut down. People in the remaining elevators may see an indicator light or hear a voice announcement informing them that the elevator will return to the lobby shortly. Once all cars have successfully returned, the system will then automatically select one or more cars to be used for normal operations and these cars will return to service. The car(s) selected to run under emergency power can be manually over-ridden by a key or strip switch in the lobby. To help prevent entrapment, when the system detects that it is running low on power, it will bring the running cars to the lobby or nearest floor, open the doors, and shut down.\n\n====Hydraulic elevators====\n{{unsourced section|date=March 2020}}\nIn hydraulic elevator systems, emergency power will lower the elevators to the lowest landing and open the doors to allow passengers to exit. The doors then close after an adjustable time period and the car remains unusable until reset, usually by cycling the elevator main power switch. Typically, due to the high current draw when starting the pump motor, hydraulic elevators are not run using standard emergency power systems. Buildings like hospitals and nursing homes usually size their emergency generators to accommodate this draw. However, the increasing use of current-limiting motor starters, commonly known as \"soft-start\" contactors, avoid much of this problem, and the current draw of the pump motor is less of a limiting concern.\n\n==Modernization==\n{{unsourced section|date=March 2020}}\n[[File:G1TOWER view from Art Tower Mito.jpg|thumb|An elevator test tower]]\nMost elevators are built to provide about 30 to 40 years of service, as long as service intervals specified and periodic maintenance/inspections by the manufacturer are followed. As the elevator ages and equipment become increasingly difficult to find or replace, along with code changes and deteriorating ride performance, a complete overhaul of the elevator may be suggested to the building owners.\n\nA typical modernization consists of controller equipment, electrical wiring and buttons, position indicators and direction arrows, hoist machines and motors (including door operators), and sometimes door hanger tracks. Rarely are car slings, rails, or other heavy structures changed. The cost of an elevator modernization can range greatly depending on which type of equipment is to be installed.\n\nModernization can greatly improve operational reliability by replacing mechanical relays and contacts with solid-state electronics. Ride quality can be improved by replacing motor-generator-based drive designs with [[Variable-frequency drive|Variable-Voltage, Variable Frequency (V3F) drives]], providing near-seamless acceleration and deceleration. Passenger safety is also improved by updating systems and equipment to conform to current codes.\n\n==Safety==\n{{See also|List of elevator accidents}}\nOn 26 February 2014, the European union released their adoption of safety standards through a directive notification.<ref>{{Citation|title=Directive 2014/33/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council of 26 February 2014 on the harmonisation of the laws of the Member States relating to lifts and safety components for lifts Text with EEA relevance|date=29 March 2014|url=http://data.europa.eu/eli/dir/2014/33/oj/eng|volume=OJ L|issue=32014L0033|language=en|access-date=7 February 2019}}</ref>\n\n===Cable-borne elevators===\n[[File:Elevator speed governor.jpg|thumb|Governor]]\nStatistically speaking, cable-borne elevators are extremely safe. Their safety record is unsurpassed by any other vehicle system. In 1998, it was estimated that approximately eight millionths of one percent (1 in 12 million) of elevator rides result in an anomaly, and the vast majority of these were minor things such as the doors failing to open. Of the 20 to 30 elevator-related deaths each year, most of them are maintenance-related&nbsp;\u2014 for example, technicians leaning too far into the shaft or getting caught between moving parts,<ref name=\"windypundit.com\">{{cite web |url=http://www.windypundit.com/archives/2008/04/elevator_of_deathnot_really.html |title=Elevator of Death...Or Not \u2013 Windypundit |work=Windypundit|date=16 April 2008 }}</ref> and most of the rest are attributed to other kinds of accidents, such as people stepping blindly through doors that open into empty shafts or being strangled by scarves caught in the doors.<ref name=\"windypundit.com\"/> In fact, prior to the [[September 11th terrorist attacks]], the only known free-fall incident in a modern cable-borne elevator happened in 1945 when a [[B-25 Empire State Building crash|B-25 bomber struck the Empire State Building]] in fog, severing the cables of an elevator cab, which fell from the 75th floor all the way to the bottom of the building, seriously injuring (though not killing) the sole occupant&nbsp;\u2014 the elevator operator.<ref name=\"newyorker.com\">{{cite web |url=http://www.newyorker.com/reporting/2008/04/21/080421fa_fact_paumgarten?currentPage=all |title=Up and Then Down |date=21 April 2008 |work=The New Yorker}}</ref> However, there was an incident in 2007 at a Seattle children's hospital, where a ThyssenKrupp ISIS machine-room-less elevator free-fell until the safety brakes were engaged.<ref name=\"seattlepi.com\">{{cite news |url=http://www.seattlepi.com/local/article/4-elevators-shut-down-by-inspectors-1253339.php |work=Seattle Post-Intelligencer |first1=Aubrey |last1=Cohen |title=4 Elevators Shut Down By Inspectors |date=23 October 2007}}</ref> This was due to a flaw in the design where the cables were connected at one common point, and the kevlar ropes had a tendency to overheat and cause slipping (or, in this case, a free-fall). While it is possible (though extraordinarily unlikely) for an elevator's cable to snap, all elevators in the modern era have been fitted with several safety devices which prevent the elevator from simply free-falling and crashing. An elevator cab is typically borne by 2 to 6 (up to 12 or more in high rise installations) hoist cables or belts, each of which is capable on its own of supporting the full load of the elevator plus twenty-five percent more weight. In addition, there is a device which detects whether the elevator is descending faster than its maximum designed speed; if this happens, the device causes copper (or silicon nitride in high rise installations) brake shoes to clamp down along the vertical rails in the shaft, stopping the elevator quickly, but not so abruptly as to cause injury. This device is called the governor, and was invented by [[Elisha Graves Otis]].<ref name=\"newyorker.com\"/> In addition, an oil/hydraulic or spring or polyurethane or telescopic oil/hydraulic buffer or a combination (depending on the travel height and travel speed) is installed at the bottom of the shaft (or in the bottom of the cab and sometimes also in the top of the cab or shaft) to somewhat cushion any impact.<ref name=\"windypundit.com\"/> However, in Thailand in November 2012, a woman was killed in a free falling elevator, in what was reported as the \"first legally recognised death caused by a falling lift\".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nationmultimedia.com/national/Woman-drops-to-her-death-in-lift-plunge-30194663.html |title=Woman drops to her death in lift plunge |date=20 November 2012 |work=The Nation}}</ref>\n\n===Hydraulic elevators===\n{{unsourced section|date=March 2020}}\nPast problems with hydraulic elevators include underground electrolytic destruction of the cylinder and bulkhead, pipe failures, and control failures. Single bulkhead cylinders, typically built prior to a 1972 ASME A17.1 Elevator Safety Code change requiring a second dished bulkhead, were subject to possible [[catastrophic failure]]. The code previously permitted only single-bottom [[hydraulic cylinder]]s. In the event of a cylinder breach, the fluid loss results in uncontrolled down movement of the elevator. This creates two significant hazards: being subject to an impact at the bottom when the elevator stops suddenly and being in the entrance for a potential shear if the rider is partly in the elevator. Because it is impossible to verify the system at all times, the code requires periodic testing of the pressure capability. Another solution to protect against a cylinder blowout is to install a plunger gripping device. Two commercially available are known by the marketing names \"LifeJacket\" and \"HydroBrake\". The plunger gripper is a device which, in the event of an uncontrolled downward acceleration, nondestructively grips the plunger and stops the car. A device known as an overspeed or rupture valve is attached to the hydraulic inlet/outlet of the cylinder and is adjusted for a maximum flow rate. If a pipe or hose were to break (rupture), the flow rate of the rupture valve will surpass a set limit and mechanically stop the outlet flow of [[hydraulic fluid]], thus stopping the plunger and the car in the down direction.\n\nIn addition to the safety concerns for older hydraulic elevators, there is risk of leaking [[hydraulic oil]] into the [[aquifer]] and causing potential environmental contamination. This has led to the introduction of [[Polyvinyl chloride|PVC]] liners (casings) around hydraulic cylinders which can be monitored for integrity.\n\nIn the past decade, recent innovations in inverted [[hydraulic cylinder|hydraulic jacks]] have eliminated the costly process of drilling the ground to install a borehole jack. This also eliminates the threat of corrosion to the system and increases safety.\n\n===Mine-shaft elevators===\n{{unsourced section|date=March 2020}}\nSafety testing of [[shaft mining|mine shaft]] elevator rails is routinely undertaken. The method involves destructive testing of a segment of the cable. The ends of the segment are frayed, then set in conical [[zinc moulds]]. Each end of the segment is then secured in a large, hydraulic stretching machine. The segment is then placed under increasing load to the point of [[failure]]. Data about elasticity, load, and other factors is compiled and a report is produced. The report is then analysed to determine whether or not the entire rail is safe to use.\n\n==Uses==\n[[File:LUP-Interior.JPG|thumb|A [[Fujitec]] traction elevator in Block 192, Bishan, [[Singapore]]]]\n{{more citations needed section|date=March 2020}}\n===Passenger service===\nA passenger elevator is designed to move people between a building's floors.\n\nPassenger elevators capacity is related to the available floor space. Generally passenger elevators are available in capacities from {{convert|1000|to(-)|6000|lb|kg|-2|order=flip|abbr=on}} in {{convert|500|lb|kg|adj=on|-1|order=flip|abbr=on}} increments.{{Citation needed|date=August 2009}} Generally passenger elevators in buildings of eight floors or fewer are hydraulic or electric, which can reach speeds up to {{convert|200|ft/min|m/s|0|order=flip|abbr=on}} hydraulic and up to {{convert|500|ft/min|m/s|0|order=flip|abbr=on}} electric. In buildings up to ten floors, electric and gearless elevators are likely to have speeds up to {{convert|500|ft/min|m/s|0|order=flip|abbr=on}}, and above ten floors speeds range {{convert|500|to(-)|2000|ft/min|m/s|0|order=flip|abbr=on}}.{{Citation needed|date=August 2009}}\n\nSometimes passenger elevators are used as a city transport along with [[funicular]]s. For example, there is a 3-station underground public elevator in [[Yalta]], [[Ukraine]], which takes passengers from the top of a hill above the Black Sea on which hotels are perched, to a tunnel located on the beach below. At Casco Viejo station in the [[Bilbao Metro]], the elevator that provides access to the station from a hilltop neighbourhood doubles as city transportation: the station's ticket barriers are set up in such a way that passengers can pay to reach the elevator from the entrance in the lower city, or vice versa. See also the [[Elevator#Elevators for urban transport|Elevators for urban transport]] section.\n\n====Types of passenger elevators====\n[[File:World Trade Center Building Design with Floor and Elevator Arrangement.svg|thumb|The former [[World Trade Center (1973\u20132001)|World Trade Center]]'s twin towers used [[skylobby|skylobbies]], located on the 44th and 78th floors of each tower]]\n\nPassenger elevators may be specialised for the service they perform, including: hospital emergency ([[code blue]]), front and rear entrances, a television in high-rise buildings, [[double-deck elevator|double-decker]], and other uses. Cars may be ornate in their interior appearance, may have audio visual advertising, and may be provided with specialised recorded voice announcements. Elevators may also have [[loudspeakers]] in them to play calm, easy listening music. Such music is often referred to as [[elevator music]].\n\nAn express elevator does not serve all floors. For example, it moves between the ground floor and a [[skylobby]], or it moves from the ground floor or a skylobby to a range of floors, skipping floors in between. These are especially popular in eastern Asia.\n\n====Capacity====\nResidential elevators may be small enough to only accommodate one person while some are large enough for more than a dozen. Wheelchair, or platform elevators, a specialised type of elevator designed to move a [[wheelchair]] {{convert|12|ft|m|1|order=flip|abbr=on}} or less, can often accommodate just one person in a wheelchair at a time with a load of {{convert|750|lb|kg|0|order=flip|abbr=on}}.<ref>{{cite book |title=Safety Standard For Platform Lifts and Stairway Chairlifts ASME A18.1\u20132003 |year=2003 |publisher=American Society of Mechanical Engineers |location=New York, NY |page=34 (of 69 pages) |edition=2003}} Viewed August 2013.</ref>\n\n===Freight elevators===\n[[File:IllinoisTunnelFirstTrain.jpg|thumb|A specialized elevator from 1905 for lifting [[narrow gauge]] railroad cars between a railroad freight house and the [[Chicago Tunnel Company]] tracks below]]\n[[File:Freight elevator interior.jpg|thumb|The interior of a freight elevator. It is very basic yet rugged for freight loading.]]\n\nA freight elevator, or goods lift, is an elevator designed to carry goods, rather than passengers. Freight elevators are generally required to display a written notice in the car that the use by passengers is prohibited (though not necessarily illegal), though certain freight elevators allow dual use through the use of an inconspicuous riser. In order for an elevator to be legal to carry passengers in some jurisdictions it must have a solid inner door. Freight elevators are typically larger and capable of carrying heavier loads than a passenger elevator, generally from 2,300 to 4,500&nbsp;kg. Freight elevators may have manually operated doors, and often have rugged interior finishes to prevent damage while loading and unloading. Although hydraulic freight elevators exist, [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elevator#Cable-borne_elevators Cable-Borne Elevators], or Traction Elevators are more energy efficient for the work of freight lifting, especially in taller buildings.{{Citation needed|date=November 2007}}\n\n===Sidewalk elevators===\nA '''sidewalk elevator''' is a special type of freight elevator. Sidewalk elevators are used to move materials between a basement and a ground-level area, often the [[sidewalk]] just outside the building. They are controlled via an exterior switch and emerge from a metal trap door at ground level. Sidewalk elevator cars feature a uniquely shaped top that allows this door to open and close automatically.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.elevatorbobs-elevator-pics.com/sidewalk_p1.html |title=elevatorbob's Elevator Pictures \u2013 Sidewalk Elevators \u2013 Page 1 |author=Bob Desnoyers |work=elevatorbobs-elevator-pics.com}}</ref>\n\n===Stage lifts===\n\n<!-- \"Stage lifts\" links here -->\n'''Stage lifts''' and '''orchestra lifts''' are specialised elevators, typically powered by hydraulics, that are used to raise and lower entire sections of a theatre stage. For example, [[Radio City Music Hall]] has four such elevators: an orchestra lift that covers a large area of the stage, and three smaller lifts near the rear of the stage. In this case, the orchestra lift is powerful enough to raise an entire orchestra, or an entire cast of performers (including live elephants) up to stage level from below. There's a barrel on the background of the image of the left which can be used as a scale to represent the size of the mechanism\n\n<gallery class=\"center\" widths=\"220px\" heights=\"250px\">\nRadioCityMusicHallStageLift1.JPG|The pit beneath the orchestra lift at Radio City Music Hall\nRadioCityMusicHallStageLift2.jpg|Orchestra lift at Radio City Music Hall as viewed from beneath the stage\n</gallery>\n\n===Vehicle elevators===\n{{main article|Car elevator}}\nVehicular elevators are used within buildings or areas with limited space (in place of ramps), generally to move [[car]]s into the parking garage or manufacturer's storage. Geared hydraulic chains (not unlike bicycle chains) generate lift for the platform and there are no counterweights. To accommodate building designs and improve accessibility, the platform may rotate so that the driver only has to drive forward. Most vehicle elevators have a weight capacity of 2 tons.\n\nRare examples of extra-heavy elevators for 20-ton [[lorry|lorries]], and even for [[railcar]]s (like one that was used at [[Dnipro (Kiev Metro)|Dnipro Station]] of the [[Kiev Metro]]) also occur.\n\n===Boat lift===\n{{Main|Boat lift}}\n\nIn some smaller canals, boats and small ships can pass between different levels of a canal with a boat elevator rather than through a [[lock (water transport)|canal lock]].\n\n===Aircraft elevators===\n[[File:Aircraft elevator USS Kitty Hawk.jpg|thumb|An [[F/A-18]]C on an aircraft elevator of {{USS|Kitty Hawk|CV-63|6}}]]\n{{more citations needed section|date=March 2020}}\n====For aircraft====\nOn [[aircraft carrier]]s, elevators carry aircraft between the flight deck and the hangar deck for operations or repairs. These elevators are designed for much greater capacity than other elevators, up to {{convert|200000|lb||order=flip|abbr=on}} of aircraft and equipment. Smaller elevators lift munitions to the flight deck from magazines deep inside the ship.\n\n====Within aircraft====\nOn some passenger [[double-deck aircraft]] such as the [[Boeing 747]] or other [[widebody aircraft]], elevators transport flight attendants and food and beverage trolleys from lower deck [[galley (kitchen)|galleys]] to upper passenger carrying decks.<ref name=\"Bowman2014\">{{cite book |last1=Bowman |first1=Martin |title=Boeing 747: A History: Delivering the Dream |date=2014 |publisher=Pen and Sword |isbn=978-1-4738-3823-9|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Ej0RBQAAQBAJ|language=en |chapter=5 |quote=This 747, delivered to the Australian carrier in July 1971, was also the first to feature a lower-deck galley, reached by an internal elevator system.}}</ref>\n\n===Limited use and limited application===\nThe limited-use, limited-application (LU/LA) elevator is a special purpose passenger elevator used infrequently, and which is exempt from many commercial regulations and accommodations. For example, a LU/LA is primarily meant to be handicapped accessible, and there might only be room for a single wheelchair and a standing passenger.\n\n===Residential elevator===\n[[File:Visilift Visi-58 Round Residential Elevator.jpg|thumb|A residential elevator with integrated hoistway construction and machine-room-less design]]\n\nA residential elevator or [[home lift]] is often permitted to be of lower cost and complexity than full commercial elevators. They may have unique design characteristics suited for home furnishings, such as hinged wooden shaft-access doors rather than the typical metal sliding doors of commercial elevators. Construction may be less robust than in commercial designs with shorter maintenance periods, but safety systems such as locks on shaft access doors, fall arrestors, and emergency phones must still be present in the event of malfunction.\n\nThe [[American Society of Mechanical Engineers]] (ASME) has a specific section of Safety Code (ASME A17.1 Section 5.3) which addresses Residential Elevators. This section allows for different parameters to alleviate design complexity based on the limited use of a residential elevator by a specific user or user group. Section 5.3 of the ASME A17.1 Safety Code is for Private Residence Elevators, which does not include multi-family dwellings.<ref>{{cite book |title=Safety code for elevators and escalators : includes requirements for elevators, escalators, dumbwaiters, moving walks, material elevators, and dumbwaiters with automatic transfer devices |year=2007 |publisher=American Society of Mechanical Engineers |location=New York, N.Y. |isbn=978-0791830390 |page=532 |author=American Society of Mechanical Engineers}}</ref>\n\nSome types of residential elevators do not use a traditional elevator shaft, machine room, and elevator hoistway. This allows an elevator to be installed where a traditional elevator may not fit, and simplifies installation. The ASME board first approved machine-room-less systems in a revision of the ASME A17.1 in 2007. Machine-room-less elevators have been available commercially since the mid 1990s, however cost and overall size prevented their adoption to the residential elevator market until around 2010.<ref>{{cite web |title=New Elevator Technology: The Machine Room-Less Elevator |url=http://continuingeducation.construction.com/article.php?L=14&C=220&P=1 |work=Architectural Record |publisher=McGraw Hill Financial |access-date=12 August 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130516193821/http://continuingeducation.construction.com/article.php?L=14&C=220&P=1 |archive-date=16 May 2013 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nAlso, residential elevators are smaller than commercial elevators. The smallest passenger elevator is pneumatic, and it allows for only 1 person.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.vacuumelevators.com/pve30 |title=30\" Vacuum Elevators For Sale &#124; Pneumatic Vacuum Elevators |website=Vacuumelevators.com |accessdate=26 April 2017}}</ref>\nThe smallest traction elevator allows for just 2 persons.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.mh-he.co.jp/family_product/ |title=\u5bb6\u5ead\u30fb\u4f4f\u5b85\u7528\u30a8\u30ec\u30d9\u30fc\u30bf\u30fc\uff5c\u4e09\u83f1\u65e5\u7acb\u30db\u30fc\u30e0\u30a8\u30ec\u30d9\u30fc\u30bf\u30fc |website=Mh-he.co.jp |access-date=26 April 2017}}</ref>\n\n===Dumbwaiter===\n{{Main|Dumbwaiter}}\nDumbwaiters are small freight elevators that are intended to carry food, books or other small freight loads rather than passengers. They often connect kitchens to rooms on other floors. They usually do not have the same safety features found in passenger elevators, like various ropes for redundancy. They have a lower capacity, and they can be up to {{convert|1|m|ft|0}} tall. Control panels at every stop mimic those found in passenger elevators, allowing calling, door control and floor selection.\n\n===Paternoster===\n[[File:BMF Paternoster.jpg|thumb|upright|left|A [[paternoster lift|paternoster]] in [[Berlin]], Germany]]\n{{Main|Paternoster elevator}}\n\nA special type of elevator is the [[paternoster lift|paternoster]], a constantly moving chain of boxes. A similar concept, called the [[belt manlift|manlift]] or [[humanlift]], moves only a small platform, which the rider mounts while using a handhold seen in multi-story industrial plants.\n\n===Scissor lift===\n[[File:Hebebuehne Scissorlift.jpg|right|thumb|A mobile scissor lift, extended to near its highest position]]\n\nThe [[scissor lift]] is yet another type of lift. These are usually mobile work platforms that can be easily moved to where they are needed, but can also be installed where space for counter-weights, machine room and so forth is limited. The mechanism that makes them go up and down is like that of a [[scissor jack]].\n\n===Rack-and-pinion elevator===\n[[Rack-and-pinion]] elevator are powered by a motor driving a pinion gear. Because they can be installed on a building or structure's exterior and there is no machine room or hoistway required, they are the most used type of elevator for buildings under construction (to move materials and tools up and down).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.gedausa.com/rack-and-pinion-elevators.html |title=Rack and Pinion Elevators \u2013 Rack and Pinion Lift \u2013 GEDA \u2013 USA |website=Gedausa.com |accessdate=26 April 2017}}</ref>\n\n===Material handling belts and belt elevators===\nMaterial transport elevators generally consist of an inclined plane on which a conveyor belt runs. The conveyor often includes partitions to ensure that the material moves forward. These elevators are often used in industrial and agricultural applications. When such mechanisms (or spiral screws or pneumatic transport) are used to elevate grain for storage in large vertical silos, the entire structure is called a [[grain elevator]]. Belt elevators are often used in docks for loading loose materials such as coal, iron ore and grain into the holds of [[bulk carrier]]s\n\nThere have occasionally been [[belt manlift|belt lifts]] for humans; these typically have steps about every {{convert|2|m|1|abbr=on}} along the length of the belt, which moves vertically, so that the passenger can stand on one step and hold on to the one above. These belts are sometimes used, for example, to carry the employees of parking garages, but are considered too dangerous for public use.\n\n==Social impact==\nBefore the widespread use of elevators, most residential buildings were limited to about seven stories. The wealthy lived on lower floors, while poorer residents\u2014required to climb many flights of stairs\u2014lived on higher floors. The elevator reversed this social stratification, exemplified by the modern penthouse suite.<ref name=\"Bethune\">{{cite web |last=Bethune |first=Brian |title=How the Elevator Changed Everything |publisher=Maclean's |date=24 March 2014 |url=http://www.macleans.ca/culture/books/how-the-elevator-changed-everything-2/}}</ref>\n\nEarly users of elevators sometimes reported nausea caused by abrupt stops while descending, and some users would use stairs to go down. In 1894, a Chicago physician documented \"elevator sickness\".<ref name=\"Bethune\"/>\n\nElevators necessitated new social protocols. When [[Nicholas II of Russia]] visited the [[Hotel Adlon]] in Berlin, his courtiers panicked about who would enter the elevator first, and who would press the buttons. In ''Lifted: A Cultural History of the Elevator'', author Andreas Bernard documents other social impacts caused by the modern elevator, including thriller movies about stuck elevators, casual encounters and sexual tension on elevators, the reduction of personal space and [[claustrophobia]], and concerns about personal hygiene.<ref>{{cite news |title=The Lift, a Life, Lift-Off: The Bucket on Ropes that Changed the World |work=The Economist|date=15 February 2014 |url=https://www.economist.com/news/books-and-arts/21596491-bucket-ropes-changed-world-lift}}</ref>\n\n==Convenience features==\n[[File:LCD elevator indicator.JPG|thumb|LCD elevator floor indicator]]\n[[File:WaldolfAstoriaElevatorjpg.JPG|thumb|A typical elevator indicator located in the [[Waldorf Astoria New York]]. This elevator was made by Otis.]]\nElevators may feature talking devices as an accessibility aid for the blind. In addition to floor arrival notifications, the computer announces the direction of travel (OTIS is well known for this in some of their GEN2 model elevators), and notifies the passengers before the doors are to close.\n\nIn addition to the call buttons, elevators usually have floor indicators (often illuminated by [[LED]]) and direction lanterns. The former are almost universal in cab interiors with more than two stops and may be found outside the elevators as well on one or more of the floors. Floor indicators can consist of a [[dial (measurement)|dial]] with a rotating [[measuring instrument|needle]], but the most common types are those with successively illuminated floor indications or [[liquid crystal display|LCDs]]. Likewise, a change of floors or an arrival at a floor is indicated by a sound, depending on the elevator.\n\nDirection lanterns are also found both inside and outside elevator cars, but they should always be visible from outside because their primary purpose is to help people decide whether or not to get on the elevator. If somebody waiting for the elevator wants to go up, but a car comes first that indicates that it is going down, then the person may decide not to get on the elevator. If the person waits, then one will still stop going up. Direction indicators are sometimes etched with arrows or shaped like arrows and/or use the convention that one that lights up red means \"down\" and green (or white) means \"up\". Since the colour convention is often undermined or over-ridden by systems that do not invoke it, it is usually used only in conjunction with other differentiating factors. An example of a place whose elevators use only the colour convention to differentiate between directions is the [[Museum of Contemporary Art, Chicago|Museum of Contemporary Art]] in Chicago, where a single circle can be made to light up green for \"up\" and red for \"down\". Sometimes directions must be inferred by the position of the indicators relative to one another.\n\nIn addition to lanterns, most elevators have a chime to indicate if the elevator is going up or down either before or after the doors open, usually in conjunction with the lanterns lighting up. For example, one chime can indicate \"up\", two \"down\", and no chimes indicate an elevator that is 'free'.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.access-board.gov/attachments/article/1350/adaag.pdf#page=40|title=Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) Accessibility Guidelines for Buildings and Facilities|author=<!-- not applicable -->|at=Section 4.10.4 Hall Lanterns (p. 37)|publisher=[[United States Access Board|U.S. Architectural and Transportation Barriers Compliance Board (Access Board)]]|access-date=13 April 2019|quote=A visible and audible signal shall be provided at each hoistway entrance to indicate which car is answering a call.

It stabilises the condition of the air inside the elevator car. Some elevator air conditioners can be used in countries with cold climates if a thermostat is used to reverse the refrigeration cycle to warm the elevator car.\n\nHeat generated from the cooling process is dissipated into the hoistway. The elevator cab (or car) is ordinarily not air-tight, and some of this heat may reenter the car and reduce the overall cooling effect.\n\nThe air from the lobby constantly leaks into the elevator shaft due to elevator movements as well as elevator shaft ventilation requirements. Using this conditioned air in the elevator does not increase energy costs. However, by using an independent elevator air conditioner to achieve better temperature control inside the car, more energy will be used.\n\nAir conditioning poses a problem to elevators because of the condensation that occurs. The condensed water produced has to be disposed of; otherwise, it would create flooding in the elevator car and hoistway.\n\n====Methods of removing condensed water====\nThere are at least four ways to remove condensed water from the air conditioner. However, each solution has its pros and cons.\n\n====Atomizing====\nAtomizing, also known as misting the condensed water, is one way to dispose of the condensed water. Spraying ultra-fine water droplets onto the hot coils of the air conditioner ensures that the condensed water evaporates quickly.\n\nThough this is one of the best methods to dispose of the condensed water, it is also one of the costliest because the nozzle that atomises the water easily gets choked. The majority of the cost goes to maintaining the entire atomising system.\n\n====Boiling====\nDisposing of condensed water works by firstly collecting the condensed water and then heating it to above boiling point. The condensed water is eventually evaporated, thereby disposing of it.\n\nConsumers are reluctant to employ this system because of the high rate of energy used just to dispose of this water.\n\n====Cascading====\nThe cascading method works by flowing the condensed water directly onto the hot coils of the air conditioner. This eventually evaporates the condensed water.\n\nThe downside of this technology is that the coils have to be at extremely high temperature for the condensed water to be evaporated. There is a chance that the water might not evaporate entirely and that would cause water to overflow onto the exterior of the car.\n\n====Drainage system====\nDrainage system works by creating a sump to collect the condensed water and using a pump to dispose of it through a drainage system.\n\nIt is an efficient method, but it comes at a heavy price because the cost of building the sump. Moreover, maintaining the pump to make sure it operates is very expensive. Furthermore, the pipes used for drainage would look ugly on the exterior. This system also cannot be implemented on a built project.\n\n==ISO 22559==\n[[File:Licenciado Gustavo D\u00edaz Ordaz International Airport (2014) - 03.JPG|thumb|right|A symbol for elevator]]\n[[File:Kaohsiung Mosque - Elevator.jpg|thumb|Elevator for the [[disability|disabled]] at [[Kaohsiung Mosque]] in [[Taiwan]]]]\n\nThe mechanical and electrical design of elevators is dictated according to various standards (aka elevator codes), which may be international, national, state, regional or city based.

Passenger elevators are tested using the ASME A17.2 Standard. The frequency of these tests is mandated by the local jurisdiction, which may be a town, city, state or provincial standard.\n\nPassenger elevators must also conform to many ancillary building codes including the Local or State building code, [[National Fire Protection Association]] standards for Electrical, Fire Sprinklers and Fire Alarms, Plumbing codes, and [[HVAC]] codes. Also, passenger elevators are required to conform to the Americans with Disabilities Act and other State and Federal civil rights legislation regarding accessibility.\n\nResidential elevators are required to conform to ASME A17.1. Platform and Wheelchair elevators are required to comply with ASME A18.1 in most US jurisdictions.\n\nMost elevators have a location in which the permit for the building owner to operate the elevator is displayed. While some jurisdictions require the permit to be displayed in the elevator cab, other jurisdictions allow for the operating permit to be kept on file elsewhere \u2013 such as the maintenance office \u2013 and to be made available for inspection on demand.

Tenants of even-numbered floors first take an escalator (or an elevator from the parking garage) to the 2nd level, where they will enter the upper deck and arrive at their floors. The lower deck is turned off during low-volume hours, and the upper deck can act as a single-level elevator stopping at all adjacent floors. For example, the 85th floor restaurants can be accessed from the 60th floor sky-lobby. Restaurant customers must clear their reservations at the reception counter on the 2nd floor. A bank of express elevators stop only on the sky lobby levels (36 and 60, upper-deck car), where tenants can transfer to \"local\" elevators.\n\nThe high-speed observation deck elevators accelerate to a world-record certified speed of {{convert|1010|m/min|km/h|0}} in 16 seconds, and then it slows down for arrival with subtle air pressure sensations. The door opens after 37 seconds from the 5th floor. Special features include aerodynamic car and counterweights, and cabin pressure control to help passengers adapt smoothly to pressure changes.

Passing through the doors the passengers in small groups enter a horizontal cylindrical compartment containing seats on each side and a flat floor. A number of these compartments are linked to form a train. These compartments each individually retain an appropriate level orientation by tilting while the entire train follows curved tracks up one leg of the arch.\n\nThere are two tramways within the Arch, one at the north end, and the other at the south end. The entry doors have windows, so people travelling within the Arch are able to see the interior structure of the Arch during the ride to and from the observation deck. At the beginning of the trip the cars hang from the drive cables, but as the angle of the shaft changes, they end up beside and then on top of the cables.\n\n[[File:ElevatorShaftHannoverNewCityHallLookingUp.jpg|thumb|left|View up the shaft of the elevator at the New City Hall, [[Hanover]], Germany]]\n\n===New City Hall, Hanover, Germany===\n[[File:ElevatorHannoverNewCityHallSketch.png|thumb|100px|Elevator in the new city hall, Hanover, Germany, showing the cabin at the bottom and the top]]\n\nThe elevator in the [[New City Hall (Hanover)|New City Hall]] in [[Hanover]], [[Germany]], is a technical rarity, and unique in Europe, as the elevator starts straight up but\nthen changes its angle by 15 degrees to follow the contour of the dome of the hall. The cabin therefore tilts 15 degrees during the ride. The elevator travels a height of 43 meters. The new city hall was built in 1913.

The central element of this attraction is a simulated free-fall achieved through the use of a high-speed elevator system. For safety reasons, passengers are seated and secured in their seats rather than standing. Unlike most traction elevators, the elevator car and [[counterweight]] are joined using a rail system in a continuous loop running through both the top and the bottom of the drop shaft. This allows the drive motor to pull down on the elevator car from underneath, resulting in downward acceleration greater than that of normal gravity. The high-speed drive motor is used to rapidly lift the elevator as well.\n\nThe passenger cabs are mechanically separated from the lift mechanism, thus allowing the elevator shafts to be used continuously while passengers board and embark from the cabs, as well as move through show scenes on various floors. The passenger cabs, which are [[automated guided vehicle]]s or AGVs, move into the vertical motion shaft and lock themselves in before the elevator starts moving vertically. Multiple elevator shafts are used to further improve passenger throughput. The doorways of the top few \"floors\" of the attraction are open to the outdoor environment, thus allowing passengers to look out from the top of the structure.\n\n===\"Top of the Rock\" elevators===\nGuests ascending to the 67th, 69th, and 70th level observation decks (dubbed \"[[Top of the Rock]]\") atop the [[GE Building]] at [[Rockefeller Center]] in [[New York City]] ride a high-speed glass-top elevator. When entering the cab, it appears to be any normal elevator ride. However, once the cab begins moving, the interior lights turn off and a special blue light above the cab turns on. This lights the entire shaft, so riders can see the moving cab through its glass ceiling as it rises and lowers through the shaft. Music plays and various animations are also displayed on the ceiling. The entire ride takes about 60 seconds.\n\n===The Haunted Mansion===\nPart of the [[Haunted Mansion]] attraction at [[Disneyland Park (Anaheim)|Disneyland]] in [[Anaheim, California]], and [[Disneyland Park (Paris)|Disneyland]] in [[Paris, France]], takes place on an elevator. The \"stretching room\" on the ride is actually an elevator that travels downwards, giving access to a short tunnel which leads to the rest of the attraction. The elevator has no ceiling and its shaft is decorated to look like walls of a mansion. Because there is no roof, passengers are able to see the walls of the shaft by looking up, which gives the illusion of the room stretching.\n\n===For urban transport===\n[[File:Elevador de Santa Justa.jpg|thumb|[[Elevador de Santa Justa]], in [[Lisbon]], Portugal]]\n{{example farm|section|date=September 2018}}\n\nIn some towns where terrain is difficult to navigate, elevators are used as part of urban transport systems.\n[[File:Elevador Lacerda.jpg|thumb|''Elevador Lacerda'' in [[Salvador, Bahia|Salvador]], Brazil. ]]\n[[File:Shanklin Cliff Lift.JPG|thumb|Shanklin Cliff elevator in [[Shanklin]], [[Isle of Wight]]]]\n\nExamples:\n* [[Alexandria, Virginia]], USA \u2013 public [[inclined elevator]]s connect to [[Huntington station (Washington Metro)|Huntington station]]\n* [[Almada]], Portugal \u2013 [[Boca do Vento Elevator]]\n* [[Bad Schandau]], Germany \u2013 [[Bad Schandau Elevator]]\n* [[Barcelona]], Spain \u2013 elevator and cableway line connecting the port terminal to [[Montju\u00efc]] hill\n* [[Bilbao]], Spain \u2013 [[Zazpikaleak/Casco Viejo|Casco Viejo station]] (fare-paying elevator connecting upper and lower neighbourhoods, as well as the station)\n* [[Brussels]], Belgium \u2013 [[Marollen|Marolles]], Belgium: \"Ascenseur des Marolles\", links the upper part of the city to the lower one, from Place Poelaert to Breughel square\n* [[B\u00fcrgenstock]], Switzerland \u2013 [[Hammetschwand Elevator]]\n* [[Chongqing]], China \u2013 public elevator at Kaixuan Road\n* [[Coimbra]], Portugal \u2013 {{ill|Elevador do Mercado|pt}}\n* [[Genoa]], Italy \u2013 eleven public elevators\n* [[Hamburg]], Germany \u2013 [[Elbe Tunnel (1911)|Old Elbe Tunnel]] elevators\n* [[Hastings]], UK \u2013 [[East Hill Cliff Railway]]\n* [[Helgoland]], [[Schleswig-Holstein]], Germany \u2013 connects upper and lower parts of the island\n* [[Hong Kong]] \u2013 public elevators connecting [[Wah Fu Estate]] to [[Wah Kwai Estate]]\n* [[\u0130zmir]], Turkey \u2013 [[Asans\u00f6r]]\n* [[Jersey City, New Jersey]], USA \u2013 elevator at [[Hudson\u2013Bergen Light Rail]] station at 9th Street and Palisade Avenue\n* [[Knoxville, Tennessee]], USA \u2013 outdoor public elevator at World's Fair Park\n* [[Lisbon]], Portugal \u2013 ''[[Santa Justa Lift|Elevador de Santa Justa]]'', ''Castelo'' (planned), ''Chiado'' (closed), ''Munic\u00edpio/Biblioteca'' (demolished)\n* [[Luxembourg City]], Luxembourg \u2013 [[Pfaffenthal Panoramic Elevator]]\n* [[Lynchburg, Virginia]], USA \u2013 outdoor public elevator that connects Church Street on the lower level and Court Street on the upper level\n* [[Marburg]], Germany \u2013 some parts of the historic city core built on higher ground (Uppertown, \"Oberstadt\" in German) are accessible from the lower street level by elevators.

Elevators are typically powered by electric motors that drive traction cables and counterweight systems such as a [[hoist (device)|hoist]], although some pump hydraulic fluid to raise a cylindrical piston like a [[hydraulic jack|jack]].\n\nIn agriculture and manufacturing, an elevator is any type of [[conveyor]] device used to lift materials in a continuous stream into bins or [[silo]]s. Several types exist, such as the chain and [[bucket elevator]], grain auger [[screw conveyor]] using the principle of [[Archimedes' screw]], or the chain and paddles or forks of [[hay elevator]]s. Languages other than English may have [[loanword]]s based on either ''elevator'' or ''lift''.

The invention of a system based on the [[Leadscrew|screw drive]] was perhaps the most important step in elevator technology since ancient times, leading to the creation of modern passenger elevators. The first screw drive elevator was built by [[Ivan Kulibin]] and installed in the [[Winter Palace]] in 1793, although there may have been an earlier design by [[Leonardo da Vinci]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=RO5PAAAAMAAJ&q=%22words+%22four+screws+lift+this%22%22&dq=%22words+%22four+screws+lift+this%22%22&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjHmq3y1pfoAhVERxUIHUdUAaoQ6AEIKTAA|title=Leonardo Da Vinci, Engineer and Architect|first1=Leonardo da|last1=Vinci|first2=Leonardo (da|last2=Vinci)|first3=Mus\u00e9e des|last3=Beaux-Arts (Montr\u00e9al)|first4=Pierre|last4=Th\u00e9berge|date=10 April 1987|publisher=Montreal Museum of Fine Arts|via=Google Books}}</ref> Several years later another of Kulibin's elevators was installed in the [[Arkhangelskoye Palace|Arkhangelskoye]] near [[Moscow]].\n\n===Industrial era===\nThe development of elevators was led by the need for movement of raw materials including [[coal]] and [[lumber]] from hillsides. The technology developed by these industries and the introduction of steel beam construction worked together to provide the passenger and freight elevators in use today.\n\nStarting in the coal mines, by the mid-19th century elevators were operated with [[steam power]] and were used for moving goods in bulk in mines and factories. These steam driven devices were soon being applied to a diverse set of purposes\u2014in 1823, two [[architect]]s working in [[London]], Burton and Hormer, built and operated a novel tourist attraction, which they called the \"ascending room\". It elevated paying customers to a considerable height in the center of London, allowing them a magnificent panoramic view of downtown.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://conveyor-tech.com/dictionary/catalog/10/index.html |title=Conveyor technology: Elevator |publisher=conveyor-tech.com |access-date=19 May 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080621145810/http://www.conveyor-tech.com/dictionary/catalog/10/index.html |archive-date=21 June 2008 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nEarly, crude steam-driven elevators were refined in the ensuing decade; in 1835, an innovative elevator called the \"Teagle\" was developed by the company Frost and Stutt in [[England]]. The elevator was belt-driven and used a [[counterweight]] for extra power.<ref>{{cite web |last=Bellis |first=Mary |url=http://inventors.about.com/od/estartinventions/a/Elevator.htm |title=Learn Who Invented the Elevator and More |website=Inventors.about.com |accessdate=26 April 2017}}</ref>\n\nThe hydraulic crane was invented by Sir [[William Armstrong, 1st Baron Armstrong|William Armstrong]] in 1846, primarily for use at the [[Tyneside]] docks for loading cargo. These quickly supplanted the earlier steam driven elevators: exploiting [[Pascal's law]], they provided a much greater force. A water pump supplied a variable level of [[water pressure]] to a plunger encased inside a vertical cylinder, allowing the level of the platform (carrying a heavy load) to be raised and lowered. Counterweights and balances were also used to increase the lifting power of the apparatus.\n\n[[Henry Waterman]] of New York is credited with inventing the \"standing rope control\" for an elevator in 1850.<ref Name=\"TheElevatorMuseumTimeline\">{{cite web |url=http://www.theelevatormuseum.org/timeline.php |title=EW Museum |website=Theelevatormuseum.org |access-date=26 April 2017}}</ref>\n\nIn 1845, the Neapolitan architect [[Gaetano Genovese]] installed in the [[Royal Palace of Caserta]] the \"Flying Chair\", an elevator ahead of its time, covered with chestnut wood outside and with maple wood inside. It included a light, two benches and a hand-operated signal, and could be activated from the outside, without any effort on the part of the occupants. Traction was controlled by a motor mechanic utilising a system of toothed wheels. A safety system was designed to take effect if the cords broke. It consisted of a beam pushed outwards by a steel spring.\n\n[[File:Elisha OTIS 1854.jpg|thumb|[[Elisha Otis]] demonstrating his safety system, [[New York Crystal Palace|Crystal Palace]], 1854]]\n\nIn 1852, [[Elisha Otis]] introduced the safety elevator, which prevented the fall of the cab if the cable broke.

His elevator ran faster and with larger loads than hydraulic or steam elevators, and 584 electric elevators were installed before Sprague sold his company to the Otis Elevator Company in 1895. Sprague also developed the idea and technology for multiple elevators in a single shaft.\n\nIn 1882, when [[fluid power|hydraulic power]] was a well established technology, a company later named the [[London Hydraulic Power Company]] was formed by [[Edward B.

An elevator is essentially a platform that is either pulled or pushed up by a mechanical means. A modern-day elevator consists of a cab (also called a \"cage\", \"carriage\" or \"car\") mounted on a platform within an enclosed space called a shaft or sometimes a \"hoistway\". In the past, elevator drive mechanisms were powered by steam and water hydraulic pistons or by hand. In a \"traction\" elevator, cars are pulled up by means of rolling steel ropes over a deeply grooved [[pulley]], commonly called a sheave in the industry. The weight of the car is balanced by a [[counterweight]]. Sometimes two elevators are built so that their cars always move synchronously in opposite directions, and are each other's counterweight.\n\nThe friction between the ropes and the pulley furnishes the traction which gives this type of elevator its name.\n\nHydraulic elevators use the principles of [[hydraulics]] (in the sense of [[fluid power|hydraulic power]]) to pressurise an above ground or in-ground piston to raise and lower the car (see ''Hydraulic elevators'' below). Roped hydraulics use a combination of both ropes and hydraulic power to raise and lower cars. Recent innovations include permanent magnet motors, machine room-less rail mounted gearless machines, and microprocessor controls.\n\nThe technology used in new installations depends on a variety of factors. Hydraulic elevators are cheaper, but installing cylinders greater than a certain length becomes impractical for very-high lift hoistways. For buildings of much over seven floors, traction elevators must be employed instead. Hydraulic elevators are usually slower than traction elevators.\n\nElevators are a candidate for [[mass customisation]].\nThere are economies to be made from [[mass production]] of the components, but each building comes with its own requirements like different number of floors, dimensions of the well and usage patterns.\n\n===Doors===\n{{unsourced section|date=March 2020}}\nElevator [[doors]] prevent riders from falling into, entering, or tampering with anything in the shaft. The most common configuration is to have two panels that meet in the middle, and slide open laterally. In a cascading telescopic configuration (potentially allowing wider entryways within limited space), the doors roll on independent tracks so that while open, they are tucked behind one another, and while closed, they form cascading layers on one side. This can be configured so that two sets of such cascading doors operate like the center opening doors described above, allowing for a very wide elevator cab. In less expensive installations the elevator can also use one large \"slab\" door: a single panel door the width of the doorway that opens to the left or right laterally. Some buildings have elevators with the single door on the shaftway, and double cascading doors on the cab.\n\n===Machine room-less (MRL) elevators===\n{{unsourced section|date=March 2020}}\n[[File:Kone EcoDisc.jpg|thumb|Kone EcoDisc. The entire drive system is in the hoistway]]\nMachine room-less elevators are designed so that most of the components fit within the shaft containing the elevator car; and a small cabinet houses the elevator controller. Other than the machinery being in the hoistway, the equipment is similar to a normal traction or hole-less hydraulic elevator. The world's first machine room-less elevator, the Kone MonoSpace was introduced in 1996, by [[Kone]]. The benefits are:\n* creates more usable space\n* use less energy (70\u201380% less than standard hydraulic elevators)\n* uses no oil (assuming it is a traction elevator)\n* all components are above ground similar to roped hydraulic type elevators (this takes away the environmental concern that was created by the [[hydraulic cylinder]] on direct hydraulic type elevators being stored underground)\n* slightly lower cost than other elevators; significantly so for the hydraulic MRL elevator\n* can operate at faster speeds than hydraulics but not normal traction units.\n\n====Detriments====\n{{unsourced section|date=March 2020}}\n* Equipment can be harder, and significantly more dangerous to service and maintain.\n\n====Facts====\n* Noise level is at 50\u201355 dBA ([[A-weighted]] [[decibels]]), which can be lower than some but not all types of elevators.\n* Usually used for [[low-rise]] to mid-rise buildings\n* The motor mechanism is placed in the hoistway itself\n* The US was slow to accept the commercial MRL Elevator because of codes\n* National and local building codes did not address elevators without machine rooms.

Geared machines use [[worm gear]]s to control mechanical movement of elevator cars by \"rolling\" steel hoist ropes over a drive sheave which is attached to a [[gearbox]] driven by a high-speed motor. These machines are generally the best option for basement or overhead traction use for speeds up to {{convert|500|ft/min|m/s|0|order=flip|abbr=on}}.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://acelifts.com/news/traction-lifts-work/ |title=Traction Lifts: an infographic on how they work |author=ACE Lifts |work=ACE Lifts}}</ref>\n\nHistorically, AC motors were used for single or double-speed elevator machines on the grounds of cost and lower usage applications where car speed and passenger comfort were less of an issue, but for higher speed, larger capacity elevators, the need for infinitely variable speed control over the traction machine becomes an issue. Therefore, DC machines powered by an AC/DC [[Motor\u2013generator|motor generator]] were the preferred solution. The [[Motor\u2013generator|MG set]] also typically powered the [[relay logic|relay]] controller of the elevator, which has the added advantage of electrically isolating the elevators from the rest of a building's electrical system, thus eliminating the transient power spikes in the building's electrical supply caused by the motors starting and stopping (causing lighting to dim every time the elevators are used for example), as well as interference to other electrical equipment caused by the arcing of the relay contactors in the control system.\n\nThe widespread availability of variable frequency AC drives has allowed AC motors to be used universally, bringing with it the advantages of the older motor-generator, DC-based systems, without the penalties in terms of efficiency and complexity. The older MG-based installations are gradually being replaced in older buildings due to their poor energy efficiency.\n\nGearless traction machines are low-speed (low-RPM), high-[[torque]] electric motors powered either by AC or DC. In this case, the drive sheave is directly attached to the end of the motor. Gearless traction elevators can reach speeds of up to {{convert|4000|ft/min|m/s|0|order=flip|abbr=on}}, A brake is mounted between the motor and gearbox or between the motor and drive sheave or at the end of the drive sheave to hold the elevator stationary at a floor. This brake is usually an external [[drum brake|drum type]] and is actuated by spring force and held open electrically; a power failure will cause the brake to engage and prevent the elevator from falling (see [[inherent safety]] and [[safety engineering]]). But it can also be some form of [[disc brake|disc type]] like 1 or more calipers over a disc in one end of the motor shaft or drive sheave which is used in high speed, high rise and large capacity elevators with machine rooms(an exception is the Kone MonoSpace's EcoDisc which is not high speed, high rise and large capacity and is machine room less but it uses the same design as is a thinner version of a conventional gearless traction machine) for braking power, compactness and [[redundancy (engineering)|redundancy]] (assuming there's at least 2 calipers on the disc), or 1 or more disc brakes with a single caliper at one end of the motor shaft or drive sheave which is used in machine room less elevators for compactness, braking power, and [[redundancy (engineering)|redundancy]] (assuming there's 2 brakes or more).\n\nIn each case, cables are attached to a hitch plate on top of the cab or may be \"underslung\" below a cab, and then looped over the drive sheave to a [[counterweight]] attached to the opposite end of the cables which reduces the amount of [[power (physics)|power]] needed to move the cab. The counterweight is located in the hoist-way and is carried along a separate railway system; as the car goes up, the counterweight goes down, and vice versa. This action is powered by the traction machine which is directed by the controller, typically a relay logic or computerised device that directs starting, [[acceleration]], [[deceleration]] and stopping of the elevator cab. The weight of the counterweight is typically equal to the weight of the elevator cab plus 40\u201350% of the capacity of the elevator. The grooves in the drive sheave are specially designed to prevent the cables from slipping. \"[[Traction (engineering)|Traction]]\" is provided to the ropes by the grip of the grooves in the sheave, thereby the name. As the ropes age and the traction grooves wear, some traction is lost and the ropes must be replaced and the sheave repaired or replaced. Sheave and rope wear may be significantly reduced by ensuring that all ropes have equal tension, thus sharing the load evenly. Rope tension equalisation may be achieved using a rope tension gauge, and is a simple way to extend the lifetime of the sheaves and ropes.\n\nElevators with more than {{convert|30|m|0|abbr=on}} of travel have a system called compensation. This is a separate set of cables or a chain attached to the bottom of the counterweight and the bottom of the elevator cab. This makes it easier to control the elevator, as it compensates for the differing weight of cable between the hoist and the cab. If the elevator cab is at the top of the hoist-way, there is a short length of hoist cable above the car and a long length of compensating cable below the car and vice versa for the counterweight. If the compensation system uses cables, there will be an additional sheave in the pit below the elevator, to guide the cables. If the compensation system uses chains, the chain is guided by a bar mounted between the counterweight tracks.\n\n===Regenerative drives===\nAnother energy-saving improvement is the regenerative drive,<ref>Debbie Sniderman, [https://www.asme.org/engineering-topics/articles/elevators/energy-efficient-elevator-technologies \"Energy Efficient Elevator Technologies\"], American Society of Mechanical Engineers ASME Sept. 2012</ref> which works analogously to [[regenerative braking]] in vehicles, using the elevator's electric motor as a generator to capture some of the gravitational potential energy of descent of a full cab (heavier than its counterweight) or ascent of an empty cab (lighter than its counterweight) and return it to the building's electrical system.\n\n===Hydraulic elevators===\n[[File:Elevator hydraulic.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Pit of a hydraulic scenic elevator with metal grating on bottom. This elevator travels 7 stories.]]\n* ''Conventional hydraulic elevators''. They use an underground [[hydraulic cylinder]], are quite common for low level buildings with two to five floors (sometimes but seldom up to six to eight floors), and have speeds of up to {{convert|200|ft/min|m/s|0|order=flip|abbr=on}}. For higher rise applications, a telescopic hydraulic cylinder can be used.{{citation needed|reason=Hydraulic elevators with telescoping shafts are common, especially in 'holeless' or 'reduced depth hole' designs, but if there are any applications above about eight stories, this needs a cite|date=May 2016}}\n* ''Holeless hydraulic elevators'' were developed in the 1970s, and use a pair of above ground cylinders, which makes it practical for environmentally or cost sensitive buildings with two, three, or four floors.\n* ''Roped hydraulic elevators'' use both above ground cylinders and a rope system, allowing the elevator to travel further than the piston has to move.\n\nThe low mechanical complexity of hydraulic elevators in comparison to traction elevators makes them ideal for low rise, low traffic installations. They are less energy efficient as the pump works against gravity to push the car and its passengers upwards; this energy is lost when the car descends on its own weight. The high current draw of the pump when starting up also places higher demands on a building's electrical system. There are also environmental concerns should the lifting cylinder leak fluid into the ground.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://science.howstuffworks.com/transport/engines-equipment/elevator1.htm |title=How Elevators Work: Hydraulic Elevators |author=Harris, Tom |publisher=[[HowStuffWorks]]|date=12 February 2002 }}</ref>\n\nThe modern generation of low-cost, machine room-less traction elevators made possible by advances in [[miniaturisation]] of the traction motor and control systems challenges the supremacy of the hydraulic elevator in their traditional market niche.{{Citation needed|date=February 2019}}\n\n===Electromagnetic propulsion===\nCable-free elevators using [[electromagnetic propulsion]], capable of moving both vertically and horizontally, have been developed by German engineering firm [[Thyssen Krupp]] for use in high rise, high density buildings.<ref>{{cite web|title=MULTI \u2013 Rope-free elevator system \u2013 thyssenkrupp Elevator|url=https://multi.thyssenkrupp-elevator.com/en/|website=multi.thyssenkrupp-elevator.com|publisher=[[Thyssen Krupp]]|accessdate=19 October 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190119034447/https://multi.thyssenkrupp-elevator.com/en/|archive-date=19 January 2019|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last1=Condliffe|first1=Jamie|title=Meet the world's first cable-free elevator\u2014it can zoom horizontally or vertically|url=https://www.technologyreview.com/s/608167/worlds-first-cable-free-elevator-zooms-horizontally-and-vertically-using-maglev-tech/|website=MIT Technology Review|publisher=[[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]]|accessdate=19 October 2017|language=en}}</ref>\n\n===Climbing elevator===\n{{unsourced section|date=March 2020}}\nA climbing elevator is a self-ascending elevator with its own propulsion. The propulsion can be done by an electric or a combustion engine. Climbing elevators are used in guyed masts or towers, in order to make easy access to parts of these constructions, such as flight safety lamps for maintenance. An example would be the [[moonlight tower]]s in Austin, Texas, where the elevator holds only one person and equipment for maintenance. The [[Glasgow Tower]]&nbsp;\u2014 an observation tower in [[Glasgow]], [[Scotland]]&nbsp;\u2014 also makes use of two climbing elevators.  Temporary climbing elevators are commonly used in the construction of new high-rise buildings to move materials and personnel before the building's permanent elevator system is installed, at which point the climbing elevators are dismantled.\n\n===Pneumatic elevator===\nAn elevator of this kind uses a vacuum on top of the cab and a valve on the top of the \"shaft\" to move the cab upwards and closes the valve in order to keep the cab at the same level. A diaphragm or a piston is used as a \"brake\", if there's a sudden increase in pressure above the cab. To go down, it opens the valve so that the air can pressurise the top of the \"shaft\", allowing the cab to go down by its own weight. This also means that in case of a power failure, the cab will automatically go down. The \"shaft\" is made of acrylic, and is always round due to the shape of the vacuum pump turbine. To keep the air inside of the cab, rubber seals are used. Due to technical limitations, these elevators have a low capacity, they usually allow 1\u20133 passengers and up to 525&nbsp;lbs.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Knight|first1=Will|title=Vacuum elevator gives users a gentle lift|url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn7353-vacuum-elevator-gives-users-a-gentle-lift/|website=[[New Scientist]]|accessdate=23 November 2017|date=6 May 2005}}</ref>\n\n==Controls==\n\n===Manual controls===\n{{unsourced section|date=March 2020}}\n[[File:OtisControl.jpg|thumb|Otis 1920s controller, operational in a New York City apartment building]]\nIn the first half of the twentieth century, almost all elevators had no automatic positioning of the floor on which the cab would stop. Some of the older freight elevators were controlled by switches operated by pulling on adjacent ropes. In general, most elevators before WWII were manually controlled by [[elevator operator]]s using a [[rheostat]] connected to the motor. This rheostat (see picture) was enclosed within a cylindrical container about the size and shape of a cake. This was mounted upright or sideways on the cab wall and operated via a projecting handle, which was able to slide around the top half of the cylinder.\n\nThe elevator motor was located at the top of the shaft or beside the bottom of the shaft. Pushing the handle forward would cause the cab to rise; backwards would make it sink. The harder the pressure, the faster the elevator would move. The handle also served as a [[dead man switch]]: if the operator let go of the handle, it would return to its upright position, causing the elevator cab to stop. In time, safety interlocks would ensure that the inner and outer doors were closed before the elevator was allowed to move.\n\nThis lever would allow some control over the energy supplied to the motor and so enabled the elevator to be accurately positioned&nbsp;\u2014 if the operator was sufficiently skilled. More typically, the operator would have to \"jog\" the control, moving the cab in small increments until the elevator was reasonably close to the landing point. Then the operator would direct the outgoing and incoming passengers to \"watch the step\".\n[[File:mit-old-elevator-panel.jpg|thumb|Manual pushbutton elevator controls]]\n\nAutomatic elevators began to appear as early as the 1920s,{{citation needed|date=August 2016}} their development being hastened by [[strike action|striking]] elevator operators which brought large cities dependent on skyscrapers (and therefore their elevators) such as New York and Chicago to their knees. Self service elevators were not allowed in New York City until 1922.  Prior to this, non-luxury buildings that could not afford an attendant were built as five-story walk ups.  These electromechanical systems used [[relay logic]] circuits of increasing complexity to control the speed, position and door operation of an elevator or bank of elevators.\n\nThe Otis ''Autotronic'' system of the early 1950s brought the earliest predictive systems which could anticipate traffic patterns within a building to deploy elevator movement in the most efficient manner. Relay-controlled elevator systems remained common until the 1980s and their gradual replacement with solid-state, [[microprocessor]]-based controls are now the industry standard. Most older, manually-operated elevators have been retrofitted with automatic or semi-automatic controls.\n\n[[File:Dover elevator button.jpg|thumb|Typical freight elevator control station]]\n[[File:Dover Impulse at Bob's Furniture - Nashua, NH.jpg|thumb|Typical passenger elevator control station]]\n[[File:Ringing the elevator alarm.jpg|thumb|Using the emergency call button in an elevator.

In some elevators, certain floors are inaccessible unless one swipes a security card or enters a passcode (or both).\n** Door open and door close buttons.\n\nThe operation of the door open button is transparent, immediately opening and holding the door, typically until a timeout occurs and the door closes.

In this case (hastening normal closure), the door close button has no effect. However, the door close button will cause a hall call to be ignored (so the door won't reopen), and once the timeout has expired, the door close will immediately close the door, for example to cancel a door open push. The minimum timeout for automatic door closing in the US is 5 seconds,<ref>ASME A17.1 \u2013 2000, Safety Code for Elevators and Escalators, Requirements 4.10.7 \u2013 Door and Signal Timing for Hall Calls, \"The minimum acceptable notification time shall be 5 seconds.\"</ref> which is a noticeable delay if not over-ridden.\n* An alarm button or switch, which passengers can use to warn the premises manager that they have been trapped in the elevator.\n* A set of doors kept locked on each floor to prevent unintentional access into the elevator shaft by the unsuspecting individual. The door is unlocked and opened by a machine sitting on the roof of the car, which also drives the doors that travel with the car. Door controls are provided to close immediately or reopen the doors, although the button to close them immediately is often disabled during normal operations, especially on more recent elevators. Objects in the path of the moving doors will either be detected by sensors or physically activate a switch that reopens the doors. Otherwise, the doors will close after a preset time. Some elevators are configured to remain open at the floor until they are required to move again.  Regulations often require doors to close after use to prevent smoke from entering the elevator shaft in event of fire.\n* Elevators in high traffic buildings often have a \"nudge\" function (the Otis ''Autotronic'' system first introduced this feature){{citation needed|date=March 2020}} which will close the doors at a reduced speed, and sound a buzzer if the \"door open\" button is being deliberately held down, or if the door sensors have been blocked for too long a time.\n* A stop switch (not allowed under British regulations{{Citation needed|date=May 2018}}) to halt the elevator while in motion and often used to hold an elevator open while freight is loaded. Keeping an elevator stopped for too long may set off an alarm. Unless local codes require otherwise, this will most likely be a [[key switch]].\n\nSome elevators may have one or more of the following:\n* An [[Emergency telephone|elevator telephone]], which can be used (in addition to the alarm) by a trapped passenger to call for help. This may consist of a transceiver, or simply a button.  This feature is often required by local regulations.\n* Hold button: This button delays the door closing timer, useful for loading freight and hospital beds.\n* Call cancellation: A destination floor may be deselected by double clicking.\n* Access restriction by key switches, RFID reader, code keypad, hotel room card, etc.\n* One or more additional sets of doors. This is primarily used to serve different floor plans: on each floor only one set of doors opens. For example, in an elevated crosswalk setup, the front doors may open on the street level, and the rear doors open on the crosswalk level. This is also common in garages, rail stations, and airports. Alternatively, both doors may open on a given floor. This is sometimes timed so that one side opens first for getting off, and then the other side opens for getting on, to improve boarding/exiting speed. This is particularly useful when passengers have luggage or carts, as at an airport, due to reduced manoeuvrability.\n**[[File:Dual elevator door buttons - cropped.jpg|thumb|Dual door open and door close buttons, in an elevator with two sets of doors.]] In case of dual doors, there may be two sets of door open and door close buttons, with one pair controlling the front doors, from the perspective of the console, typically denoted &lt;&gt; and &gt;&lt;, with the other pair controlling the rear doors, typically denoted with a line in the middle, <nowiki>&lt;|&gt; and &gt;|&lt;</nowiki>, or double lines, <nowiki>|&lt;&gt;| and &gt;||&lt;</nowiki>.

When pressed at a certain floor, the button (also known as a \"hall call\" button) calls the elevator to pick up more passengers. If the particular elevator is currently serving traffic in a certain direction, it will only answer calls in the same direction unless there are no more calls beyond that floor.\n\nIn a group of two or more elevators, the call buttons may be linked to a central dispatch computer, such that they illuminate and cancel together. This is done to ensure that only one car is called at one time.\n\nKey switches may be installed on the ground floor so that the elevator can be remotely switched on or off from the outside.\n\nIn destination control systems, one selects the intended destination floor (in lieu of pressing ''\"up\"'' or ''\"down\"'') and is then notified which elevator will serve their request.\n\n===Floor numbering===\n[[File:Missing Floor 13.jpg|thumb|Elevator buttons showing the missing [[Thirteenth floor|13th floor]]]]\n{{further|Floor numbering}}\n{{empty section|date=March 2020}}\n===Elevator algorithm===\nThe [[elevator algorithm]], a simple [[algorithm]] by which a single elevator can decide where to stop, is summarised as follows:\n* Continue travelling in the same direction while there are remaining requests in that same direction.\n* If there are no further requests in that direction, then stop and become idle, or change direction if there are requests in the opposite direction.\nThe elevator algorithm has found an application in computer [[operating system]]s as an algorithm for scheduling [[hard disk]] requests.\nModern elevators use more complex [[heuristic (computer science)|heuristic algorithms]] to decide which request to service next. An introduction to these algorithms can be found in the \"Elevator traffic handbook: theory and practice\" given in the references below.\n\n===Destination control system===\n{{main|Destination dispatch}}\n[[File:Destination control elevator floor selection.jpg|thumb|A destination control elevator floor selection panel at [[Northeastern University]] in Boston, United States]]\nSome skyscraper buildings and other types of installation feature a destination operating panel where a passenger registers their floor calls before entering the car. The system lets them know which car to wait for, instead of everyone boarding the next car. In this way, travel time is reduced as the elevator makes fewer stops for individual passengers, and the computer distributes adjacent stops to different cars in the bank. Although travel time is reduced, passenger waiting times may be longer as they will not necessarily be allocated the next car to depart. During the down peak period the benefit of destination control will be limited as passengers have a common destination.\n\nIt can also improve accessibility, as a mobility-impaired passenger can move to his or her designated car in advance.\n\nInside the elevator there is no call button to push, or the buttons are there but they cannot be pushed&nbsp;\u2014 except door opening and alarm button&nbsp;\u2014 they only indicate stopping floors.\n\nThe idea of destination control was originally conceived by [[Leo Port]] from Sydney in 1961,<ref>Port, L.W. (1961), Elevator System Commonwealth of Australia Patent Specification, Application Number 1421/61, 14 February 1961</ref> but at that time elevator controllers were implemented in relays and were unable to optimise the performance of destination control allocations.\n\nThe system was first pioneered by [[Schindler Group|Schindler Elevator]] in 1992 as the Miconic 10. Manufacturers of such systems claim that average travelling time can be reduced by up to 30%.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www6.schindler.com/SEC/websecen.nsf/pages/elev-MHR-Mic10-01 |title=Schindler Elevators, Escalators, Moving Walks Service Mod Company |website=Schindler.com |access-date=26 April 2017}}</ref>\n\nHowever, performance enhancements cannot be generalised as the benefits and limitations of the system are dependent on many factors.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.peters-research.com/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=100%3Aunderstanding-the-benefits-and-limitations-of-destination-control&catid=3%3Apapers&Itemid=1 |title=Peters Research Ltd |author=Richard Peters |work=peters-research.com}}</ref> One problem is that the system is subject to gaming. Sometimes, one person enters the destination for a large group of people going to the same floor. The dispatching [[algorithm]] is usually unable to completely cater for the variation, and latecomers may find the elevator they are assigned to is already full. Also, occasionally, one person may press the floor multiple times. This is common with up/down buttons when people believe this to be an effective way to hurry elevators. However, this will make the computer think multiple people are waiting and will allocate empty cars to serve this one person.\n\nTo prevent this problem, in one implementation of destination control, every user is given an [[RFID]] card, for identification and tracking, so that the system knows every user call and can cancel the first call if the passenger decides to travel to another destination, preventing empty calls. The newest invention knows even where people are located and how many on which floor because of their identification, either for the purposes of evacuating the building or for security reasons.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.theporttechnology.com/page/systemoperation.html |title=The PORT Technology :: System Operation |work=theporttechnology.com}}</ref> Another way to prevent this issue is to treat everyone travelling from one floor to another as one group and to allocate only one car for that group.\n\nThe same destination scheduling concept can also be applied to public transit such as in [[group rapid transit]].\n[[File:DestinationDispatchElevator.jpg|thumb|upright|A [[destination dispatch]] control station, outside of the car, on which the user presses a button to indicate the desired destination floor, and the panel indicates which car will be dispatched]]\n\n==Special operating modes==\n{{more citations needed section|date=March 2020}}\n===Anti-crime protection===\nThe anti-crime protection (ACP) feature will force each car to stop at a pre-defined landing and open its doors. This allows a security guard or a receptionist at the landing to visually inspect the passengers. The car stops at this landing as it passes to serve further demand.\n\n===Up peak===\nDuring up-peak mode (also called moderate incoming traffic), elevator cars in a group are recalled to the lobby to provide expeditious service to passengers arriving at the building, most typically in the morning as people arrive for work or at the conclusion of a lunch-time period when people are going back to work. Elevators are dispatched one-by-one when they reach a pre-determined passenger load, or when they have had their doors opened for a certain period of time. The next elevator to be dispatched usually has its hall lantern or a \"this car leaving next\" sign illuminated to encourage passengers to make maximum use of the available elevator system capacity. Some elevator banks are programmed so that at least one car will always return to the lobby floor and park whenever it becomes free.\n\nThe commencement of up-peak may be triggered by a time clock, by the departure of a certain number of fully loaded cars leaving the lobby within a given time period, or by a switch manually operated by a building attendant.\n\n===Down peak===\nDuring down-peak mode, elevator cars in a group are sent away from the lobby towards the highest floor served, after which they commence running down the floors in response to hall calls placed by passengers wishing to leave the building. This allows the elevator system to provide maximum passenger handling capacity for people leaving the building.\n\nThe commencement of down-peak may be triggered by a time clock, by the arrival of a certain number of fully loaded cars at the lobby within a given time period, or by a switch manually operated by a building attendant.\n\n===Sabbath service===\n[[File:Sabbath on-off.jpg|thumb|upright|left|A switch to turn Sabbath elevator mode on or off]]\n\nIn areas with large populations of observant [[Jew]]s or in facilities catering to Jews, one may find a \"[[Sabbath elevator]]\". In this mode, an elevator will stop automatically at every floor, allowing people to step on and off without having to push any buttons. This prevents violation of the [[Shabbat|Sabbath]] prohibition against operating electrical devices when Sabbath is in effect for those who observe this ritual.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://ohr.edu/ask_db/ask_main.php/39/Q1/ |title=Shabbat Elevators |work=Ohr Somayach}}</ref>\n\nHowever, Sabbath mode has the side effect of using considerable amounts of energy, running the elevator car sequentially up and down every floor of a building, repeatedly servicing floors where it is not needed. For a tall building with many floors, the car must move on a frequent enough basis so as to not cause undue delay for potential users that will not touch the controls as it opens the doors on every floor up the building.\n\nSome taller buildings may have the Sabbath elevator alternate floors in order to save time and energy; for example, an elevator may stop at only even-numbered floors on the way up, and then the odd-numbered floors on the way down.\n\n===Independent service===\nIndependent service or car preference is a special mode found on most elevators. It is activated by a key switch either inside the elevator itself or on a centralised control panel in the lobby. When an elevator is placed on this mode, it will no longer respond to hall calls. (In a bank of elevators, traffic is rerouted to the other elevators, while in a single elevator, the hall buttons are disabled). The elevator will remain parked on a floor with its doors open until a floor is selected and the door close button is held until the elevator starts to travel. Independent service is useful when transporting large goods or moving groups of people between certain floors.\n\n===Inspection service===\nInspection service is designed to provide access to the hoistway and car top for inspection and maintenance purposes by qualified elevator mechanics. It is first activated by a key switch on the car operating panel usually labelled 'Inspection', 'Car Top', 'Access Enable' or 'HWENAB' (short for HoistWay access ENABled). When this switch is activated the elevator will come to a stop if moving, car calls will be cancelled (and the buttons disabled), and hall calls will be assigned to other elevator cars in the group (or cancelled in a single elevator configuration). The elevator can now only be moved by the corresponding 'Access' key switches, usually located at the highest (to access the top of the car) and lowest (to access the elevator pit) landings. The access key switches will allow the car to move at reduced inspection speed with the hoistway door open. This speed can range from anywhere up to 60% of normal operating speed on most controllers, and is usually defined by local safety codes.\n\nElevators have a car top inspection station that allows the car to be operated by a mechanic in order to move it through the hoistway. Generally, there are three buttons: UP, RUN, and DOWN. Both the RUN and a direction button must be held to move the car in that direction, and the elevator will stop moving as soon as the buttons are released. Most other elevators have an up/down toggle switch and a RUN button. The inspection panel also has standard power outlets for work lamps and powered tools.\n\n===Fire service===\nDepending on the location of the elevator, fire service code will vary state to state and country to country. Fire service is usually split up into two modes: phase one and phase two. These are separate modes that the elevator can go into.\n\nPhase one mode is activated by a corresponding smoke sensor or heat sensor in the building. Once an alarm has been activated, the elevator will automatically go into phase one. The elevator will wait an amount of time, then proceed to go into nudging mode to tell everyone the elevator is leaving the floor. Once the elevator has left the floor, depending on where the alarm was set off, the elevator will go to the fire-recall floor. However, if the alarm was activated on the fire-recall floor, the elevator will have an alternate floor to recall to. When the elevator is recalled, it proceeds to the recall floor and stops with its doors open. The elevator will no longer respond to calls or move in any direction. Located on the fire-recall floor is a fire-service key switch. The fire-service key switch has the ability to turn fire service off, turn fire service on or to bypass fire service. The only way to return the elevator to normal service is to switch it to bypass after the alarms have reset.\n\n[[File:KONE Ecodisc Elevator in Fireman's Mode.jpg|thumb|KONE Ecodisc elevator in fireman's mode]]\n\nPhase-two mode can only be activated by a key switch located inside the elevator on the centralised control panel. This mode was created for firefighters so that they may rescue people from a burning building. The phase-two key switch located on the COP has three positions: off, on, and hold. By turning phase two on, the firefighter enables the car to move. However, like independent-service mode, the car will not respond to a car call unless the firefighter manually pushes and holds the door close button. Once the elevator gets to the desired floor it will not open its doors unless the firefighter holds the door open button. This is in case the floor is burning and the firefighter can feel the heat and knows not to open the door. The firefighter must hold the door open button until the door is completely opened. If for any reason the firefighter wishes to leave the elevator, they will use the hold position on the key switch to make sure the elevator remains at that floor. If the firefighter wishes to return to the recall floor, they simply turn the key off and close the doors.\n\n===Medical emergency or code-blue service===\nCommonly found in hospitals, code-blue service allows an elevator to be summoned to any floor for use in an emergency situation. Each floor will have a code-blue recall key switch, and when activated, the elevator system will immediately select the elevator car that can respond the fastest, regardless of direction of travel and passenger load. Passengers inside the elevator will be notified with an alarm and indicator light to exit the elevator when the doors open.\n\nOnce the elevator arrives at the floor, it will park with its doors open and the car buttons will be disabled to prevent a passenger from taking control of the elevator. Medical personnel must then activate the code-blue key switch inside the car, select their floor and close the doors with the door close button. The elevator will then travel non-stop to the selected floor, and will remain in code-blue service until switched off in the car. Some hospital elevators will feature a 'hold' position on the code-blue key switch (similar to fire service) which allows the elevator to remain at a floor locked out of service until code blue is deactivated.\n\n===Riot mode===\nIn the event of civil disturbance, insurrection, or rioting, management can prevent elevators from stopping at the lobby or parking areas, preventing undesired persons from using the elevators while still allowing the building tenants to use them within the rest of the building.\n\n===Emergency power operation===\nMany elevator installations now feature emergency power systems such as [[uninterruptible power supply]] (UPS) which allow elevator use in blackout situations and prevent people from becoming trapped in elevators. To be compliant with BS 9999 safety standards, a passenger lift being used in an emergency situation must have a secondary source of power. In many cases, providing a secondary mains feed simply isn't possible, so a UPS and or generator combination is used instead.<ref name=\"powercontrol.co.uk\">{{Cite web | url=https://powercontrol.co.uk/blog/ups-emergency-lifts/ |title = Secondary Power Supplies for Emergency Evacuation Lifts}}</ref>\n\nWhere a generator is being used as the secondary power supply in a hospital, a UPS must also be present to meet regulations stating that healthcare facilities must test their emergency generators under load at least once per month. During the test period only one supply of power is feeding the lift, in a blackout situation without a UPS, the lifts would not be operational.<ref name=\"powercontrol.co.uk\"/>\n\n====Traction elevators====\n{{unsourced section|date=March 2020}}\nWhen power is lost in a traction elevator system, all elevators will initially come to a halt. One by one, each car in the group will return to the lobby floor, open its doors, and shut down. People in the remaining elevators may see an indicator light or hear a voice announcement informing them that the elevator will return to the lobby shortly. Once all cars have successfully returned, the system will then automatically select one or more cars to be used for normal operations and these cars will return to service. The car(s) selected to run under emergency power can be manually over-ridden by a key or strip switch in the lobby. To help prevent entrapment, when the system detects that it is running low on power, it will bring the running cars to the lobby or nearest floor, open the doors, and shut down.\n\n====Hydraulic elevators====\n{{unsourced section|date=March 2020}}\nIn hydraulic elevator systems, emergency power will lower the elevators to the lowest landing and open the doors to allow passengers to exit. The doors then close after an adjustable time period and the car remains unusable until reset, usually by cycling the elevator main power switch. Typically, due to the high current draw when starting the pump motor, hydraulic elevators are not run using standard emergency power systems. Buildings like hospitals and nursing homes usually size their emergency generators to accommodate this draw. However, the increasing use of current-limiting motor starters, commonly known as \"soft-start\" contactors, avoid much of this problem, and the current draw of the pump motor is less of a limiting concern.\n\n==Modernization==\n{{unsourced section|date=March 2020}}\n[[File:G1TOWER view from Art Tower Mito.jpg|thumb|An elevator test tower]]\nMost elevators are built to provide about 30 to 40 years of service, as long as service intervals specified and periodic maintenance/inspections by the manufacturer are followed. As the elevator ages and equipment become increasingly difficult to find or replace, along with code changes and deteriorating ride performance, a complete overhaul of the elevator may be suggested to the building owners.\n\nA typical modernization consists of controller equipment, electrical wiring and buttons, position indicators and direction arrows, hoist machines and motors (including door operators), and sometimes door hanger tracks. Rarely are car slings, rails, or other heavy structures changed. The cost of an elevator modernization can range greatly depending on which type of equipment is to be installed.\n\nModernization can greatly improve operational reliability by replacing mechanical relays and contacts with solid-state electronics. Ride quality can be improved by replacing motor-generator-based drive designs with [[Variable-frequency drive|Variable-Voltage, Variable Frequency (V3F) drives]], providing near-seamless acceleration and deceleration. Passenger safety is also improved by updating systems and equipment to conform to current codes.\n\n==Safety==\n{{See also|List of elevator accidents}}\nOn 26 February 2014, the European union released their adoption of safety standards through a directive notification.<ref>{{Citation|title=Directive 2014/33/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council of 26 February 2014 on the harmonisation of the laws of the Member States relating to lifts and safety components for lifts Text with EEA relevance|date=29 March 2014|url=http://data.europa.eu/eli/dir/2014/33/oj/eng|volume=OJ L|issue=32014L0033|language=en|access-date=7 February 2019}}</ref>\n\n===Cable-borne elevators===\n[[File:Elevator speed governor.jpg|thumb|Governor]]\nStatistically speaking, cable-borne elevators are extremely safe. Their safety record is unsurpassed by any other vehicle system. In 1998, it was estimated that approximately eight millionths of one percent (1 in 12 million) of elevator rides result in an anomaly, and the vast majority of these were minor things such as the doors failing to open. Of the 20 to 30 elevator-related deaths each year, most of them are maintenance-related&nbsp;\u2014 for example, technicians leaning too far into the shaft or getting caught between moving parts,<ref name=\"windypundit.com\">{{cite web |url=http://www.windypundit.com/archives/2008/04/elevator_of_deathnot_really.html |title=Elevator of Death...Or Not \u2013 Windypundit |work=Windypundit|date=16 April 2008 }}</ref> and most of the rest are attributed to other kinds of accidents, such as people stepping blindly through doors that open into empty shafts or being strangled by scarves caught in the doors.<ref name=\"windypundit.com\"/> In fact, prior to the [[September 11th terrorist attacks]], the only known free-fall incident in a modern cable-borne elevator happened in 1945 when a [[B-25 Empire State Building crash|B-25 bomber struck the Empire State Building]] in fog, severing the cables of an elevator cab, which fell from the 75th floor all the way to the bottom of the building, seriously injuring (though not killing) the sole occupant&nbsp;\u2014 the elevator operator.<ref name=\"newyorker.com\">{{cite web |url=http://www.newyorker.com/reporting/2008/04/21/080421fa_fact_paumgarten?currentPage=all |title=Up and Then Down |date=21 April 2008 |work=The New Yorker}}</ref> However, there was an incident in 2007 at a Seattle children's hospital, where a ThyssenKrupp ISIS machine-room-less elevator free-fell until the safety brakes were engaged.<ref name=\"seattlepi.com\">{{cite news |url=http://www.seattlepi.com/local/article/4-elevators-shut-down-by-inspectors-1253339.php |work=Seattle Post-Intelligencer |first1=Aubrey |last1=Cohen |title=4 Elevators Shut Down By Inspectors |date=23 October 2007}}</ref> This was due to a flaw in the design where the cables were connected at one common point, and the kevlar ropes had a tendency to overheat and cause slipping (or, in this case, a free-fall). While it is possible (though extraordinarily unlikely) for an elevator's cable to snap, all elevators in the modern era have been fitted with several safety devices which prevent the elevator from simply free-falling and crashing. An elevator cab is typically borne by 2 to 6 (up to 12 or more in high rise installations) hoist cables or belts, each of which is capable on its own of supporting the full load of the elevator plus twenty-five percent more weight. In addition, there is a device which detects whether the elevator is descending faster than its maximum designed speed; if this happens, the device causes copper (or silicon nitride in high rise installations) brake shoes to clamp down along the vertical rails in the shaft, stopping the elevator quickly, but not so abruptly as to cause injury. This device is called the governor, and was invented by [[Elisha Graves Otis]].<ref name=\"newyorker.com\"/> In addition, an oil/hydraulic or spring or polyurethane or telescopic oil/hydraulic buffer or a combination (depending on the travel height and travel speed) is installed at the bottom of the shaft (or in the bottom of the cab and sometimes also in the top of the cab or shaft) to somewhat cushion any impact.<ref name=\"windypundit.com\"/> However, in Thailand in November 2012, a woman was killed in a free falling elevator, in what was reported as the \"first legally recognised death caused by a falling lift\".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nationmultimedia.com/national/Woman-drops-to-her-death-in-lift-plunge-30194663.html |title=Woman drops to her death in lift plunge |date=20 November 2012 |work=The Nation}}</ref>\n\n===Hydraulic elevators===\n{{unsourced section|date=March 2020}}\nPast problems with hydraulic elevators include underground electrolytic destruction of the cylinder and bulkhead, pipe failures, and control failures. Single bulkhead cylinders, typically built prior to a 1972 ASME A17.1 Elevator Safety Code change requiring a second dished bulkhead, were subject to possible [[catastrophic failure]]. The code previously permitted only single-bottom [[hydraulic cylinder]]s. In the event of a cylinder breach, the fluid loss results in uncontrolled down movement of the elevator. This creates two significant hazards: being subject to an impact at the bottom when the elevator stops suddenly and being in the entrance for a potential shear if the rider is partly in the elevator. Because it is impossible to verify the system at all times, the code requires periodic testing of the pressure capability. Another solution to protect against a cylinder blowout is to install a plunger gripping device. Two commercially available are known by the marketing names \"LifeJacket\" and \"HydroBrake\". The plunger gripper is a device which, in the event of an uncontrolled downward acceleration, nondestructively grips the plunger and stops the car. A device known as an overspeed or rupture valve is attached to the hydraulic inlet/outlet of the cylinder and is adjusted for a maximum flow rate. If a pipe or hose were to break (rupture), the flow rate of the rupture valve will surpass a set limit and mechanically stop the outlet flow of [[hydraulic fluid]], thus stopping the plunger and the car in the down direction.\n\nIn addition to the safety concerns for older hydraulic elevators, there is risk of leaking [[hydraulic oil]] into the [[aquifer]] and causing potential environmental contamination. This has led to the introduction of [[Polyvinyl chloride|PVC]] liners (casings) around hydraulic cylinders which can be monitored for integrity.\n\nIn the past decade, recent innovations in inverted [[hydraulic cylinder|hydraulic jacks]] have eliminated the costly process of drilling the ground to install a borehole jack. This also eliminates the threat of corrosion to the system and increases safety.\n\n===Mine-shaft elevators===\n{{unsourced section|date=March 2020}}\nSafety testing of [[shaft mining|mine shaft]] elevator rails is routinely undertaken. The method involves destructive testing of a segment of the cable. The ends of the segment are frayed, then set in conical [[zinc moulds]]. Each end of the segment is then secured in a large, hydraulic stretching machine. The segment is then placed under increasing load to the point of [[failure]]. Data about elasticity, load, and other factors is compiled and a report is produced. The report is then analysed to determine whether or not the entire rail is safe to use.\n\n==Uses==\n[[File:LUP-Interior.JPG|thumb|A [[Fujitec]] traction elevator in Block 192, Bishan, [[Singapore]]]]\n{{more citations needed section|date=March 2020}}\n===Passenger service===\nA passenger elevator is designed to move people between a building's floors.\n\nPassenger elevators capacity is related to the available floor space. Generally passenger elevators are available in capacities from {{convert|1000|to(-)|6000|lb|kg|-2|order=flip|abbr=on}} in {{convert|500|lb|kg|adj=on|-1|order=flip|abbr=on}} increments.{{Citation needed|date=August 2009}} Generally passenger elevators in buildings of eight floors or fewer are hydraulic or electric, which can reach speeds up to {{convert|200|ft/min|m/s|0|order=flip|abbr=on}} hydraulic and up to {{convert|500|ft/min|m/s|0|order=flip|abbr=on}} electric.

For example, there is a 3-station underground public elevator in [[Yalta]], [[Ukraine]], which takes passengers from the top of a hill above the Black Sea on which hotels are perched, to a tunnel located on the beach below. At Casco Viejo station in the [[Bilbao Metro]], the elevator that provides access to the station from a hilltop neighbourhood doubles as city transportation: the station's ticket barriers are set up in such a way that passengers can pay to reach the elevator from the entrance in the lower city, or vice versa. See also the [[Elevator#Elevators for urban transport|Elevators for urban transport]] section.\n\n====Types of passenger elevators====\n[[File:World Trade Center Building Design with Floor and Elevator Arrangement.svg|thumb|The former [[World Trade Center (1973\u20132001)|World Trade Center]]'s twin towers used [[skylobby|skylobbies]], located on the 44th and 78th floors of each tower]]\n\nPassenger elevators may be specialised for the service they perform, including: hospital emergency ([[code blue]]), front and rear entrances, a television in high-rise buildings, [[double-deck elevator|double-decker]], and other uses. Cars may be ornate in their interior appearance, may have audio visual advertising, and may be provided with specialised recorded voice announcements. Elevators may also have [[loudspeakers]] in them to play calm, easy listening music. Such music is often referred to as [[elevator music]].\n\nAn express elevator does not serve all floors. For example, it moves between the ground floor and a [[skylobby]], or it moves from the ground floor or a skylobby to a range of floors, skipping floors in between.

It is very basic yet rugged for freight loading.]]\n\nA freight elevator, or goods lift, is an elevator designed to carry goods, rather than passengers. Freight elevators are generally required to display a written notice in the car that the use by passengers is prohibited (though not necessarily illegal), though certain freight elevators allow dual use through the use of an inconspicuous riser. In order for an elevator to be legal to carry passengers in some jurisdictions it must have a solid inner door. Freight elevators are typically larger and capable of carrying heavier loads than a passenger elevator, generally from 2,300 to 4,500&nbsp;kg. Freight elevators may have manually operated doors, and often have rugged interior finishes to prevent damage while loading and unloading. Although hydraulic freight elevators exist, [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elevator#Cable-borne_elevators Cable-Borne Elevators], or Traction Elevators are more energy efficient for the work of freight lifting, especially in taller buildings.{{Citation needed|date=November 2007}}\n\n===Sidewalk elevators===\nA '''sidewalk elevator''' is a special type of freight elevator. Sidewalk elevators are used to move materials between a basement and a ground-level area, often the [[sidewalk]] just outside the building. They are controlled via an exterior switch and emerge from a metal trap door at ground level. Sidewalk elevator cars feature a uniquely shaped top that allows this door to open and close automatically.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.elevatorbobs-elevator-pics.com/sidewalk_p1.html |title=elevatorbob's Elevator Pictures \u2013 Sidewalk Elevators \u2013 Page 1 |author=Bob Desnoyers |work=elevatorbobs-elevator-pics.com}}</ref>\n\n===Stage lifts===\n\n<!-- \"Stage lifts\" links here -->\n'''Stage lifts''' and '''orchestra lifts''' are specialised elevators, typically powered by hydraulics, that are used to raise and lower entire sections of a theatre stage.

In this case, the orchestra lift is powerful enough to raise an entire orchestra, or an entire cast of performers (including live elephants) up to stage level from below.

Geared hydraulic chains (not unlike bicycle chains) generate lift for the platform and there are no counterweights. To accommodate building designs and improve accessibility, the platform may rotate so that the driver only has to drive forward. Most vehicle elevators have a weight capacity of 2 tons.\n\nRare examples of extra-heavy elevators for 20-ton [[lorry|lorries]], and even for [[railcar]]s (like one that was used at [[Dnipro (Kiev Metro)|Dnipro Station]] of the [[Kiev Metro]]) also occur.\n\n===Boat lift===\n{{Main|Boat lift}}\n\nIn some smaller canals, boats and small ships can pass between different levels of a canal with a boat elevator rather than through a [[lock (water transport)|canal lock]].\n\n===Aircraft elevators===\n[[File:Aircraft elevator USS Kitty Hawk.jpg|thumb|An [[F/A-18]]C on an aircraft elevator of {{USS|Kitty Hawk|CV-63|6}}]]\n{{more citations needed section|date=March 2020}}\n====For aircraft====\nOn [[aircraft carrier]]s, elevators carry aircraft between the flight deck and the hangar deck for operations or repairs. These elevators are designed for much greater capacity than other elevators, up to {{convert|200000|lb||order=flip|abbr=on}} of aircraft and equipment. Smaller elevators lift munitions to the flight deck from magazines deep inside the ship.\n\n====Within aircraft====\nOn some passenger [[double-deck aircraft]] such as the [[Boeing 747]] or other [[widebody aircraft]], elevators transport flight attendants and food and beverage trolleys from lower deck [[galley (kitchen)|galleys]] to upper passenger carrying decks.<ref name=\"Bowman2014\">{{cite book |last1=Bowman |first1=Martin |title=Boeing 747: A History: Delivering the Dream |date=2014 |publisher=Pen and Sword |isbn=978-1-4738-3823-9|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Ej0RBQAAQBAJ|language=en |chapter=5 |quote=This 747, delivered to the Australian carrier in July 1971, was also the first to feature a lower-deck galley, reached by an internal elevator system.}}</ref>\n\n===Limited use and limited application===\nThe limited-use, limited-application (LU/LA) elevator is a special purpose passenger elevator used infrequently, and which is exempt from many commercial regulations and accommodations. For example, a LU/LA is primarily meant to be handicapped accessible, and there might only be room for a single wheelchair and a standing passenger.\n\n===Residential elevator===\n[[File:Visilift Visi-58 Round Residential Elevator.jpg|thumb|A residential elevator with integrated hoistway construction and machine-room-less design]]\n\nA residential elevator or [[home lift]] is often permitted to be of lower cost and complexity than full commercial elevators. They may have unique design characteristics suited for home furnishings, such as hinged wooden shaft-access doors rather than the typical metal sliding doors of commercial elevators. Construction may be less robust than in commercial designs with shorter maintenance periods, but safety systems such as locks on shaft access doors, fall arrestors, and emergency phones must still be present in the event of malfunction.\n\nThe [[American Society of Mechanical Engineers]] (ASME) has a specific section of Safety Code (ASME A17.1 Section 5.3) which addresses Residential Elevators. This section allows for different parameters to alleviate design complexity based on the limited use of a residential elevator by a specific user or user group. Section 5.3 of the ASME A17.1 Safety Code is for Private Residence Elevators, which does not include multi-family dwellings.<ref>{{cite book |title=Safety code for elevators and escalators : includes requirements for elevators, escalators, dumbwaiters, moving walks, material elevators, and dumbwaiters with automatic transfer devices |year=2007 |publisher=American Society of Mechanical Engineers |location=New York, N.Y. |isbn=978-0791830390 |page=532 |author=American Society of Mechanical Engineers}}</ref>\n\nSome types of residential elevators do not use a traditional elevator shaft, machine room, and elevator hoistway. This allows an elevator to be installed where a traditional elevator may not fit, and simplifies installation. The ASME board first approved machine-room-less systems in a revision of the ASME A17.1 in 2007. Machine-room-less elevators have been available commercially since the mid 1990s, however cost and overall size prevented their adoption to the residential elevator market until around 2010.<ref>{{cite web |title=New Elevator Technology: The Machine Room-Less Elevator |url=http://continuingeducation.construction.com/article.php?L=14&C=220&P=1 |work=Architectural Record |publisher=McGraw Hill Financial |access-date=12 August 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130516193821/http://continuingeducation.construction.com/article.php?L=14&C=220&P=1 |archive-date=16 May 2013 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nAlso, residential elevators are smaller than commercial elevators. The smallest passenger elevator is pneumatic, and it allows for only 1 person.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.vacuumelevators.com/pve30 |title=30\" Vacuum Elevators For Sale &#124; Pneumatic Vacuum Elevators |website=Vacuumelevators.com |accessdate=26 April 2017}}</ref>\nThe smallest traction elevator allows for just 2 persons.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.mh-he.co.jp/family_product/ |title=\u5bb6\u5ead\u30fb\u4f4f\u5b85\u7528\u30a8\u30ec\u30d9\u30fc\u30bf\u30fc\uff5c\u4e09\u83f1\u65e5\u7acb\u30db\u30fc\u30e0\u30a8\u30ec\u30d9\u30fc\u30bf\u30fc |website=Mh-he.co.jp |access-date=26 April 2017}}</ref>\n\n===Dumbwaiter===\n{{Main|Dumbwaiter}}\nDumbwaiters are small freight elevators that are intended to carry food, books or other small freight loads rather than passengers. They often connect kitchens to rooms on other floors. They usually do not have the same safety features found in passenger elevators, like various ropes for redundancy. They have a lower capacity, and they can be up to {{convert|1|m|ft|0}} tall. Control panels at every stop mimic those found in passenger elevators, allowing calling, door control and floor selection.\n\n===Paternoster===\n[[File:BMF Paternoster.jpg|thumb|upright|left|A [[paternoster lift|paternoster]] in [[Berlin]], Germany]]\n{{Main|Paternoster elevator}}\n\nA special type of elevator is the [[paternoster lift|paternoster]], a constantly moving chain of boxes. A similar concept, called the [[belt manlift|manlift]] or [[humanlift]], moves only a small platform, which the rider mounts while using a handhold seen in multi-story industrial plants.\n\n===Scissor lift===\n[[File:Hebebuehne Scissorlift.jpg|right|thumb|A mobile scissor lift, extended to near its highest position]]\n\nThe [[scissor lift]] is yet another type of lift. These are usually mobile work platforms that can be easily moved to where they are needed, but can also be installed where space for counter-weights, machine room and so forth is limited. The mechanism that makes them go up and down is like that of a [[scissor jack]].\n\n===Rack-and-pinion elevator===\n[[Rack-and-pinion]] elevator are powered by a motor driving a pinion gear. Because they can be installed on a building or structure's exterior and there is no machine room or hoistway required, they are the most used type of elevator for buildings under construction (to move materials and tools up and down).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.gedausa.com/rack-and-pinion-elevators.html |title=Rack and Pinion Elevators \u2013 Rack and Pinion Lift \u2013 GEDA \u2013 USA |website=Gedausa.com |accessdate=26 April 2017}}</ref>\n\n===Material handling belts and belt elevators===\nMaterial transport elevators generally consist of an inclined plane on which a conveyor belt runs. The conveyor often includes partitions to ensure that the material moves forward. These elevators are often used in industrial and agricultural applications. When such mechanisms (or spiral screws or pneumatic transport) are used to elevate grain for storage in large vertical silos, the entire structure is called a [[grain elevator]]. Belt elevators are often used in docks for loading loose materials such as coal, iron ore and grain into the holds of [[bulk carrier]]s\n\nThere have occasionally been [[belt manlift|belt lifts]] for humans; these typically have steps about every {{convert|2|m|1|abbr=on}} along the length of the belt, which moves vertically, so that the passenger can stand on one step and hold on to the one above. These belts are sometimes used, for example, to carry the employees of parking garages, but are considered too dangerous for public use.\n\n==Social impact==\nBefore the widespread use of elevators, most residential buildings were limited to about seven stories. The wealthy lived on lower floors, while poorer residents\u2014required to climb many flights of stairs\u2014lived on higher floors. The elevator reversed this social stratification, exemplified by the modern penthouse suite.<ref name=\"Bethune\">{{cite web |last=Bethune |first=Brian |title=How the Elevator Changed Everything |publisher=Maclean's |date=24 March 2014 |url=http://www.macleans.ca/culture/books/how-the-elevator-changed-everything-2/}}</ref>\n\nEarly users of elevators sometimes reported nausea caused by abrupt stops while descending, and some users would use stairs to go down. In 1894, a Chicago physician documented \"elevator sickness\".<ref name=\"Bethune\"/>\n\nElevators necessitated new social protocols. When [[Nicholas II of Russia]] visited the [[Hotel Adlon]] in Berlin, his courtiers panicked about who would enter the elevator first, and who would press the buttons. In ''Lifted: A Cultural History of the Elevator'', author Andreas Bernard documents other social impacts caused by the modern elevator, including thriller movies about stuck elevators, casual encounters and sexual tension on elevators, the reduction of personal space and [[claustrophobia]], and concerns about personal hygiene.<ref>{{cite news |title=The Lift, a Life, Lift-Off: The Bucket on Ropes that Changed the World |work=The Economist|date=15 February 2014 |url=https://www.economist.com/news/books-and-arts/21596491-bucket-ropes-changed-world-lift}}</ref>\n\n==Convenience features==\n[[File:LCD elevator indicator.JPG|thumb|LCD elevator floor indicator]]\n[[File:WaldolfAstoriaElevatorjpg.JPG|thumb|A typical elevator indicator located in the [[Waldorf Astoria New York]]. This elevator was made by Otis.]]\nElevators may feature talking devices as an accessibility aid for the blind. In addition to floor arrival notifications, the computer announces the direction of travel (OTIS is well known for this in some of their GEN2 model elevators), and notifies the passengers before the doors are to close.\n\nIn addition to the call buttons, elevators usually have floor indicators (often illuminated by [[LED]]) and direction lanterns. The former are almost universal in cab interiors with more than two stops and may be found outside the elevators as well on one or more of the floors. Floor indicators can consist of a [[dial (measurement)|dial]] with a rotating [[measuring instrument|needle]], but the most common types are those with successively illuminated floor indications or [[liquid crystal display|LCDs]]. Likewise, a change of floors or an arrival at a floor is indicated by a sound, depending on the elevator.\n\nDirection lanterns are also found both inside and outside elevator cars, but they should always be visible from outside because their primary purpose is to help people decide whether or not to get on the elevator. If somebody waiting for the elevator wants to go up, but a car comes first that indicates that it is going down, then the person may decide not to get on the elevator. If the person waits, then one will still stop going up. Direction indicators are sometimes etched with arrows or shaped like arrows and/or use the convention that one that lights up red means \"down\" and green (or white) means \"up\". Since the colour convention is often undermined or over-ridden by systems that do not invoke it, it is usually used only in conjunction with other differentiating factors. An example of a place whose elevators use only the colour convention to differentiate between directions is the [[Museum of Contemporary Art, Chicago|Museum of Contemporary Art]] in Chicago, where a single circle can be made to light up green for \"up\" and red for \"down\". Sometimes directions must be inferred by the position of the indicators relative to one another.\n\nIn addition to lanterns, most elevators have a chime to indicate if the elevator is going up or down either before or after the doors open, usually in conjunction with the lanterns lighting up. For example, one chime can indicate \"up\", two \"down\", and no chimes indicate an elevator that is 'free'.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.access-board.gov/attachments/article/1350/adaag.pdf#page=40|title=Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) Accessibility Guidelines for Buildings and Facilities|author=<!-- not applicable -->|at=Section 4.10.4 Hall Lanterns (p. 37)|publisher=[[United States Access Board|U.S. Architectural and Transportation Barriers Compliance Board (Access Board)]]|access-date=13 April 2019|quote=A visible and audible signal shall be provided at each hoistway entrance to indicate which car is answering a call.

It stabilises the condition of the air inside the elevator car. Some elevator air conditioners can be used in countries with cold climates if a thermostat is used to reverse the refrigeration cycle to warm the elevator car.\n\nHeat generated from the cooling process is dissipated into the hoistway. The elevator cab (or car) is ordinarily not air-tight, and some of this heat may reenter the car and reduce the overall cooling effect.\n\nThe air from the lobby constantly leaks into the elevator shaft due to elevator movements as well as elevator shaft ventilation requirements. Using this conditioned air in the elevator does not increase energy costs. However, by using an independent elevator air conditioner to achieve better temperature control inside the car, more energy will be used.\n\nAir conditioning poses a problem to elevators because of the condensation that occurs. The condensed water produced has to be disposed of; otherwise, it would create flooding in the elevator car and hoistway.\n\n====Methods of removing condensed water====\nThere are at least four ways to remove condensed water from the air conditioner. However, each solution has its pros and cons.\n\n====Atomizing====\nAtomizing, also known as misting the condensed water, is one way to dispose of the condensed water. Spraying ultra-fine water droplets onto the hot coils of the air conditioner ensures that the condensed water evaporates quickly.\n\nThough this is one of the best methods to dispose of the condensed water, it is also one of the costliest because the nozzle that atomises the water easily gets choked. The majority of the cost goes to maintaining the entire atomising system.\n\n====Boiling====\nDisposing of condensed water works by firstly collecting the condensed water and then heating it to above boiling point. The condensed water is eventually evaporated, thereby disposing of it.\n\nConsumers are reluctant to employ this system because of the high rate of energy used just to dispose of this water.\n\n====Cascading====\nThe cascading method works by flowing the condensed water directly onto the hot coils of the air conditioner. This eventually evaporates the condensed water.\n\nThe downside of this technology is that the coils have to be at extremely high temperature for the condensed water to be evaporated. There is a chance that the water might not evaporate entirely and that would cause water to overflow onto the exterior of the car.\n\n====Drainage system====\nDrainage system works by creating a sump to collect the condensed water and using a pump to dispose of it through a drainage system.\n\nIt is an efficient method, but it comes at a heavy price because the cost of building the sump. Moreover, maintaining the pump to make sure it operates is very expensive. Furthermore, the pipes used for drainage would look ugly on the exterior. This system also cannot be implemented on a built project.\n\n==ISO 22559==\n[[File:Licenciado Gustavo D\u00edaz Ordaz International Airport (2014) - 03.JPG|thumb|right|A symbol for elevator]]\n[[File:Kaohsiung Mosque - Elevator.jpg|thumb|Elevator for the [[disability|disabled]] at [[Kaohsiung Mosque]] in [[Taiwan]]]]\n\nThe mechanical and electrical design of elevators is dictated according to various standards (aka elevator codes), which may be international, national, state, regional or city based. Whereas once many standards were prescriptive, specifying exact criteria which must be complied with, there has recently been a shift towards more performance-based standards where the onus falls on the designer to ensure that the elevator meets or exceeds the standard.\n\nNational elevator standards:\n* Australia \u2013 AS1735\n* Canada \u2013 CAN/CSA B44\n* Europe \u2013 EN 81 series (EN 81-1, EN 81-2, EN 81-28, EN 81-70, EN 12015, EN 12016, EN 13015, etc.)\n* India \u2013 Indian Standard \u2013 Installation and Maintenance of home lifts (Code of practice 2002)<ref>{{Cite book|url=http://archive.org/details/gov.in.is.15259.2002|title=IS 15259: Installation and Maintenance of Home Lifts \u2013 Code of Practice|last=Bureau of Indian Standards|date=2002|others=Public.Resource.Org|language=English}}</ref>\n* USA \u2013 ASME A17\n\nconverged in ISO 22559 series, \"Safety requirements for lifts (elevators)\":<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.lift-report.de/index.php?mact=News,cntnt01,print,0&cntnt01articleid=462&cntnt01showtemplate=false&cntnt01returnid=432 |title=New EN 81 goes ISO ... |work=lift-report.de}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.iso.org/iso/catalogue_detail.htm?csnumber=61455 |title=ISO 22559-1:2014 \u2013 Safety requirements for lifts (elevators) \u2013 Part 1: Global essential safety requirements (GESRs) |work=iso.org}}</ref>\n* Part 1: Global essential safety requirements (GESRs).\n* Part 2: Safety parameters meeting the global essential safety requirements (GESRs).\n* Part 3: Global conformity assessment procedures (GCAP) \u2013 Prerequisites for certification of conformity of lift systems, lift components and lift functions\n* Part 4: Global conformity assessment procedures (GCAP) \u2013 Certification and accreditation requirements\n\n[[ISO/TC 178]] is the Technical Committee on Lifts, [[escalator]]s and [[moving walk]]s.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.iso.org/iso/standards_development/technical_committees/other_bodies/iso_technical_committee.htm?commid=53970 |title=ISO \u2013 Technical committees \u2013 ISO/TC 178 \u2013 Lifts, escalators and moving walks |work=iso.org}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.iso.org/iso/home/store/catalogue_tc/catalogue_tc_browse.htm?commid=53970&published=on&includesc=true |title=ISO \u2013 ISO Standards \u2013 ISO/TC 178 \u2013 Lifts, escalators and moving walks |work=iso.org}}</ref>\n\nBecause an elevator is part of a building, it must also comply with [[building code]] standards relating to [[earthquake resilience]], [[fire standard]]s, [[electrical wiring rule]]s and so forth.\n\nThe American National Elevator Standards Group (ANESG) sets an elevator weight standard to be {{convert|2200|lbs|-1|order=flip|abbr=on}}.\n\nAdditional requirements relating to access by disabled persons, may be mandated by laws or regulations such as the [[Americans with Disabilities Act]].

Tenants of even-numbered floors first take an escalator (or an elevator from the parking garage) to the 2nd level, where they will enter the upper deck and arrive at their floors. The lower deck is turned off during low-volume hours, and the upper deck can act as a single-level elevator stopping at all adjacent floors. For example, the 85th floor restaurants can be accessed from the 60th floor sky-lobby. Restaurant customers must clear their reservations at the reception counter on the 2nd floor. A bank of express elevators stop only on the sky lobby levels (36 and 60, upper-deck car), where tenants can transfer to \"local\" elevators.\n\nThe high-speed observation deck elevators accelerate to a world-record certified speed of {{convert|1010|m/min|km/h|0}} in 16 seconds, and then it slows down for arrival with subtle air pressure sensations. The door opens after 37 seconds from the 5th floor. Special features include aerodynamic car and counterweights, and cabin pressure control to help passengers adapt smoothly to pressure changes. The downwards journey is completed at a reduced speed of 600 meters per minute, with the doors opening at the 52nd second.\n\n===Gateway Arch===\n[[File:Gateway Arch tram car.JPG|thumb|The interior of one of the Gateway Arch tramway cars]]\n{{Main|Gateway Arch}}\n\nThe Gateway Arch in [[St. Louis, Missouri]], United States, has a unique [[Montgomery Elevator|Montgomery]] elevator system which carries passengers from the visitors' center underneath the Arch to the observation deck at the top of the structure.\n\nCalled a ''tram'' or ''tramway'', people enter this unique [[tram]]way much as one would enter an ordinary elevator, through double doors. Passing through the doors the passengers in small groups enter a horizontal cylindrical compartment containing seats on each side and a flat floor. A number of these compartments are linked to form a train. These compartments each individually retain an appropriate level orientation by tilting while the entire train follows curved tracks up one leg of the arch.\n\nThere are two tramways within the Arch, one at the north end, and the other at the south end. The entry doors have windows, so people travelling within the Arch are able to see the interior structure of the Arch during the ride to and from the observation deck. At the beginning of the trip the cars hang from the drive cables, but as the angle of the shaft changes, they end up beside and then on top of the cables.\n\n[[File:ElevatorShaftHannoverNewCityHallLookingUp.jpg|thumb|left|View up the shaft of the elevator at the New City Hall, [[Hanover]], Germany]]\n\n===New City Hall, Hanover, Germany===\n[[File:ElevatorHannoverNewCityHallSketch.png|thumb|100px|Elevator in the new city hall, Hanover, Germany, showing the cabin at the bottom and the top]]\n\nThe elevator in the [[New City Hall (Hanover)|New City Hall]] in [[Hanover]], [[Germany]], is a technical rarity, and unique in Europe, as the elevator starts straight up but\nthen changes its angle by 15 degrees to follow the contour of the dome of the hall. The cabin therefore tilts 15 degrees during the ride. The elevator travels a height of 43 meters. The new city hall was built in 1913. The elevator was destroyed in 1943 and rebuilt in 1954.\n\n===Luxor incline elevator===\nThe [[Luxor Hotel]] in [[Las Vegas, Nevada]], United States, has [[inclined elevator]]s. The shape of this casino is a [[pyramid]]. Therefore, the elevator travels up the side of the pyramid at a 39-degree angle. Other locations with inclined elevators include the [[Cityplace (DART station)|Cityplace Station]] in [[Dallas, Texas]], the [[Huntington (WMATA station)|Huntington Metro Station]] in [[Huntington, Virginia]], and the [[San Diego Convention Center]] in [[San Diego, California]].\n\n===Germany===\nAt the Radisson Blue in Berlin, Germany, the main elevator is surrounded by an aquarium; 82 feet tall, the aquarium contains more than a thousand different fish and offers views to people using the elevator.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://au.totaltravel.yahoo.com/galleries/g/29194655/now-thats-a-lot-of-water/29194656/#1 |title=Hotel lobby goes under the sea |website=Au.totaltravel.yahoo.com |date=6 August 2015 |access-date=26 April 2017 }}{{Dead link|date=December 2019 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>\n\n===The Twilight Zone Tower of Terror===\n{{Main|The Twilight Zone Tower of Terror}}\n\nThe Twilight Zone Tower of Terror is the common name for a series of elevator attractions at the [[Disney's Hollywood Studios]] park in Orlando, the [[Walt Disney Studios Park]] in Paris and the [[Tokyo DisneySea]] park in Tokyo. The central element of this attraction is a simulated free-fall achieved through the use of a high-speed elevator system. For safety reasons, passengers are seated and secured in their seats rather than standing. Unlike most traction elevators, the elevator car and [[counterweight]] are joined using a rail system in a continuous loop running through both the top and the bottom of the drop shaft. This allows the drive motor to pull down on the elevator car from underneath, resulting in downward acceleration greater than that of normal gravity. The high-speed drive motor is used to rapidly lift the elevator as well.\n\nThe passenger cabs are mechanically separated from the lift mechanism, thus allowing the elevator shafts to be used continuously while passengers board and embark from the cabs, as well as move through show scenes on various floors. The passenger cabs, which are [[automated guided vehicle]]s or AGVs, move into the vertical motion shaft and lock themselves in before the elevator starts moving vertically. Multiple elevator shafts are used to further improve passenger throughput. The doorways of the top few \"floors\" of the attraction are open to the outdoor environment, thus allowing passengers to look out from the top of the structure.\n\n===\"Top of the Rock\" elevators===\nGuests ascending to the 67th, 69th, and 70th level observation decks (dubbed \"[[Top of the Rock]]\") atop the [[GE Building]] at [[Rockefeller Center]] in [[New York City]] ride a high-speed glass-top elevator. When entering the cab, it appears to be any normal elevator ride. However, once the cab begins moving, the interior lights turn off and a special blue light above the cab turns on. This lights the entire shaft, so riders can see the moving cab through its glass ceiling as it rises and lowers through the shaft. Music plays and various animations are also displayed on the ceiling. The entire ride takes about 60 seconds.\n\n===The Haunted Mansion===\nPart of the [[Haunted Mansion]] attraction at [[Disneyland Park (Anaheim)|Disneyland]] in [[Anaheim, California]], and [[Disneyland Park (Paris)|Disneyland]] in [[Paris, France]], takes place on an elevator. The \"stretching room\" on the ride is actually an elevator that travels downwards, giving access to a short tunnel which leads to the rest of the attraction. The elevator has no ceiling and its shaft is decorated to look like walls of a mansion. Because there is no roof, passengers are able to see the walls of the shaft by looking up, which gives the illusion of the room stretching.\n\n===For urban transport===\n[[File:Elevador de Santa Justa.jpg|thumb|[[Elevador de Santa Justa]], in [[Lisbon]], Portugal]]\n{{example farm|section|date=September 2018}}\n\nIn some towns where terrain is difficult to navigate, elevators are used as part of urban transport systems.\n[[File:Elevador Lacerda.jpg|thumb|''Elevador Lacerda'' in [[Salvador, Bahia|Salvador]], Brazil. ]]\n[[File:Shanklin Cliff Lift.JPG|thumb|Shanklin Cliff elevator in [[Shanklin]], [[Isle of Wight]]]]\n\nExamples:\n* [[Alexandria, Virginia]], USA \u2013 public [[inclined elevator]]s connect to [[Huntington station (Washington Metro)|Huntington station]]\n* [[Almada]], Portugal \u2013 [[Boca do Vento Elevator]]\n* [[Bad Schandau]], Germany \u2013 [[Bad Schandau Elevator]]\n* [[Barcelona]], Spain \u2013 elevator and cableway line connecting the port terminal to [[Montju\u00efc]] hill\n* [[Bilbao]], Spain \u2013 [[Zazpikaleak/Casco Viejo|Casco Viejo station]] (fare-paying elevator connecting upper and lower neighbourhoods, as well as the station)\n* [[Brussels]], Belgium \u2013 [[Marollen|Marolles]], Belgium: \"Ascenseur des Marolles\", links the upper part of the city to the lower one, from Place Poelaert to Breughel square\n* [[B\u00fcrgenstock]], Switzerland \u2013 [[Hammetschwand Elevator]]\n* [[Chongqing]], China \u2013 public elevator at Kaixuan Road\n* [[Coimbra]], Portugal \u2013 {{ill|Elevador do Mercado|pt}}\n* [[Genoa]], Italy \u2013 eleven public elevators\n* [[Hamburg]], Germany \u2013 [[Elbe Tunnel (1911)|Old Elbe Tunnel]] elevators\n* [[Hastings]], UK \u2013 [[East Hill Cliff Railway]]\n* [[Helgoland]], [[Schleswig-Holstein]], Germany \u2013 connects upper and lower parts of the island\n* [[Hong Kong]] \u2013 public elevators connecting [[Wah Fu Estate]] to [[Wah Kwai Estate]]\n* [[\u0130zmir]], Turkey \u2013 [[Asans\u00f6r]]\n* [[Jersey City, New Jersey]], USA \u2013 elevator at [[Hudson\u2013Bergen Light Rail]] station at 9th Street and Palisade Avenue\n* [[Knoxville, Tennessee]], USA \u2013 outdoor public elevator at World's Fair Park\n* [[Lisbon]], Portugal \u2013 ''[[Santa Justa Lift|Elevador de Santa Justa]]'', ''Castelo'' (planned), ''Chiado'' (closed), ''Munic\u00edpio/Biblioteca'' (demolished)\n* [[Luxembourg City]], Luxembourg \u2013 [[Pfaffenthal Panoramic Elevator]]\n* [[Lynchburg, Virginia]], USA \u2013 outdoor public elevator that connects Church Street on the lower level and Court Street on the upper level\n* [[Marburg]], Germany \u2013 some parts of the historic city core built on higher ground (Uppertown, \"Oberstadt\" in German) are accessible from the lower street level by elevators.

{"title_page": "Eugene Lion", "text_new": "[[File:Eugene_Lion_Photograph.jpg|thumb|right|Eugene Lion]]\n'''Eugene Lion''' (November 4, 1933 \u2013 April 21, 2013) was an American theater director, writer, and performance coach.\n\n== Early life and training ==\nEugene Lion was born in [[Brooklyn, New York]], during the Depression. His father, David Lion, was the estranged brother of entertainer [[Eddie Cantor]]. Cantor refused to acknowledge the Lions as family because of David Lion's association with communists. Eugene was named after prominent socialist, trade unionist, and leftist presidential candidate [[Eugene Debs]].\n\nLion's first interest in the arts was in photography. He was for a time assistant to the New York photographer [[Weegee]]. Lion graduated in painting from [[Cooper Union]] in New York. His primary theatre teachers were Tamara Daykarhanova in acting and Merle Marsicano in dance. Kabuki was a major influence on his later work.\n\n==Directing==\n\nLion was the first North American to direct at The [[Abbey Theatre, Dublin|Abbey Theatre]], Ireland's national theatre, staging its commemorative production of [[Samuel Beckett]]'s ''[[Waiting for Godot]]'' in 1976, which gained notice for \"an entirely fresh, deeply imaginative approach....Lion has brought new meaning to the play -- and much new humour\".<ref>{{cite news|title=''Evening Herald'', Dublin|date=November 19, 1976|last1=Finegan|first1=John}}</ref>  In 1978 he directed their production of [[Arthur Miller]]'s ''[[The Crucible]]'', which was praised as \"a powerful, unfussy presentation, masterly in its groupings and getting from a dedicated cast acting of unusual strength and intensity.\"<ref>{{cite news|title=''Evening Herald'', Dublin|date=March 10, 1978 |last1=Finegan|first1=John}}</ref>\n\nHe was associate director of the [[Guthrie Theater production history|Guthrie Theater]] in Minneapolis (1974\u201376), where he directed ''Waiting for Godot''<ref>{{cite news|title=''Minneapolis Tribune'', Minneapolis |date=October 4, 1973|last1=Steele|first1=Mike}}</ref> and [[Bertolt Brecht|Brecht']]<nowiki/>s ''[[Mother Courage and Her Children|Mother Courage]]''.\n\nHe was founding artistic director of Guthrie 2, the Guthrie's alternative and experimental stage (1975\u201376), where his direction of an adaptation of [[Michael Ondaatje]]'s ''[[The Collected Works of Billy the Kid: Left-Handed Poems|The Collected Works of Billy the Kid]]'' was acknowledged to be \"one of the most exhilarating evenings of theater in the Twin Cities in a long while!\".<ref>{{cite news|title=''Many Corners'', Minneapolis|date=January\u2013February 1976|last1=Kranz|first1=Rachel}}</ref> Conceived by Lion as an experimental alternative theatre to the Mainstage, Guthrie 2 was dedicated to the production of living playwrights.  Its resident repertory company, which included [[John Pielmeier]], its apprentice program and its international network of alternative theatres came to an end when Lion's tenure was terminated by its parent, The Guthrie Theater, which lead to a law suit and an acrimonious parting of ways. The late-night series of productions by local independent theatre groups continued at the Southern Theater, which took over the facility.\n\nLion then became artistic director of the Hawaii Public Theater (1977\u201379), where he directed [[Peter Weiss]]'s ''[[Marat/Sade]] (1978),'' [[Jean Genet]]'s ''The Maids,'' in two versions (1978) and [[Alexander Ostrovsky]] 's ''The Fools!'' (1977).\n\nLion staged and wrote works for Canada's Theatre Beyond Words which were performed in 1985 at the [[Moscow Pushkin Drama Theatre|Pushkin Theatre]] in Moscow;<ref>{{Cite news|url=|title=\"The sheer sizzling intensity of the Guthrie 2's first staging nourishes high hopes for stimulating things from the newest, most experimental of Minneapolis' theater choices.\"|last=|first=|date=January 25, 1976|work=|publisher=The Des Moines Sunday Register, 1A|access-date=|via=|''the des moines sunday register'', des moines, 1a=}}</ref> he directed Pielmeier's [[Agnes of God]] at Dublin's Gate Theatre(1984), D\u00fcrrenmatt's ''The Physicists'' at the Advent Theatre in Nashville (1979), and [[Samuel Beckett]]'s ''[[Endgame (play)|Endgame]]'' at Ottawa's [[National Arts Centre]] (1989).\n\n== The 1960s ==\nIn 1960, Lion adapted and directed [[Ugo Betti]]'s ''The Burnt Flowerbed'' for Broadway.  In the cast were [[Eric Portman]] and [[Gloria Vanderbilt]].  Off-Broadway in the 60's, he directed [[Jacques Audiberti|Jaques Audiberti]] 's ''The Chinabird'',  [[Michel de Ghelderode]]'s ''Women at the Tomb'' and ''Escurial'', [[Robert Helpmann|Robert Hellman]]'s ''Kling'', and ''Saint Joan'' by [[George Bernard Shaw]]; in Berlin, he directed Bertolt Brecht's ''Mann ist Mann and Arturo Ui'' at the Berliner Ensemble (1969).\n\nDuring the Vietnam War, Lion became deeply involved with the anti-war movement and served as artistic director and ''agent provocateur'' of New York's [[Washington Square Methodist Episcopal Church]] (1967\u20131970), which gave sanctuary to that war's first draft resisters.  He directed the church's 1967 Christmas celebration condemning the war, which was broadcast nationwide.  Under the leadership of Lion and the Rev.

He also served as performance coach and grant-writer. The company toured Canada, Europe and the United States during the years 1982-1986.\n\nIn 1986 the work shifted to producing and touring one-woman multidisciplinary shows written and directed by Lion and performed by Lechay.

The work emphasizes heightened focus through pertinent specific, singular and compelling intention.\n\nLion was on the faculty of the University of Iowa Theatre Department and the Center for New Performing Arts (1972\u201375), where he directed an Elizabethan play, ''Woodstock,'' also called ''I Richard  II'', on roller skates (1973). He also taught acting at Montreal's Dawson College (1980\u201382) and costume design at the [[National Theatre School of Canada|National Theatre School]], also in Montreal (1984\u201386).\n\nLion wrote subversive  comedies, including ''Sammy's Follies,'' produced on [[Hornby Island]] in 1995 and ''Chrysanthemum'', produced at Montreal's [[Th\u00e9\u00e2tre d'Aujourd'hui]] in 1997 as well as three one-woman shows for his partner, Jo Lechay. He also wrote Shakespearean criticism, in particular, an unpublished analysis of ''Hamlet,'' which sees Hamlet as an unfulfilled artist/harlequin trapped in a militaristic world.\n\nLion's produced translations and adaptations are Betti's ''The Burnt Flowerbed'' and ''Queen and the Rebels'', Frisch's ''The Firebugs'', Genet's ''The Maids'', Ghelderode's ''Christopher Columbus'' and ''Women at the Tomb'', as well as Ostrovsky's ''Fools!''.\n\n==Holocaust drama==\n\n''Sammy's Follies'' was produced by the New Theatre Workshop, NY, in 1970, the Playwrights Workshop, Montreal in 1994 and the Hornby Island Theatre Society in British Columbia in 1995.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Watts|first1=Irene|title=A terrible truth : anthology of Holocaust drama|date=2004|publisher=Playwrights Canada Press|location=Toronto|isbn=978-0887546945|edition=1st, pp. vii, 359}}</ref> The play has been connected to Holocaust Drama: \"Yet the most important change among the second- and third-generation playwrights, aside from the dramatization of stories about the children and grandchildren of Holocaust victims, has been the proliferation of plays that produce theatrical effects through comedy, once thought to be demeaning or destructive to the telling of an exclusively tragic Holocaust experience.

His father, David Lion, was the estranged brother of entertainer [[Eddie Cantor]]. Cantor refused to acknowledge the Lions as family because of David Lion's association with communists. Eugene was named after prominent socialist, trade unionist, and leftist presidential candidate [[Eugene Debs]].\n\nLion's first interest in the arts was in photography. He was for a time assistant to the New York photographer [[Weegee]]. Lion graduated in painting from [[Cooper Union]] in New York. His primary theatre teachers were Tamara Daykarhanova in acting and Merle Marsicano in dance. Kabuki was a major influence on his later work.\n\n==Directing==\n\nLion was the first North American to direct at The [[Abbey Theatre, Dublin|Abbey Theatre]], Ireland's national theatre, staging its commemorative production of [[Samuel Beckett]]'s ''[[Waiting for Godot]]'' in 1976, which gained notice for \"an entirely fresh, deeply imaginative approach....Lion has brought new meaning to the play -- and much new humour\".<ref>{{cite news|title=''Evening Herald'', Dublin|date=November 19, 1976|last1=Finegan|first1=John}}</ref>  In 1978 he directed their production of [[Arthur Miller]]'s ''[[The Crucible]]'', which was praised as \"a powerful, unfussy presentation, masterly in its groupings and getting from a dedicated cast acting of unusual strength and intensity.\"<ref>{{cite news|title=''Evening Herald'', Dublin|date=March 10, 1978 |last1=Finegan|first1=John}}</ref>\n\nHe was associate director of the [[Guthrie Theater production history|Guthrie Theater]] in Minneapolis (1974\u201376), where he directed ''Waiting for Godot''<ref>{{cite news|title=''Minneapolis Tribune'', Minneapolis |date=October 4, 1973|last1=Steele|first1=Mike}}</ref> and [[Bertolt Brecht|Brecht']]<nowiki/>s ''[[Mother Courage and Her Children|Mother Courage]]''.\n\nHe was founding artistic director of Guthrie 2, the Guthrie's alternative and experimental stage (1975\u201376), where his direction of an adaptation of [[Michael Ondaatje]]'s ''[[The Collected Works of Billy the Kid: Left-Handed Poems|The Collected Works of Billy the Kid]]'' was acknowledged to be \"one of the most exhilarating evenings of theater in the Twin Cities in a long while!\".<ref>{{cite news|title=''Many Corners'', Minneapolis|date=January\u2013February 1976|last1=Kranz|first1=Rachel}}</ref> Conceived by Lion as an experimental alternative theatre to the Mainstage, Guthrie 2 was dedicated to the production of living playwrights.  Its resident repertory company, which included [[John Pielmeier]], its apprentice program and its international network of alternative theatres came to an end when Lion's tenure was terminated by its parent, The Guthrie Theater, which lead to a law suit and an acrimonious parting of ways. The late-night series of productions by local independent theatre groups continued at the Southern Theater, which took over the facility.\n\nLion then became artistic director of the Hawaii Public Theater (1977\u201379), where he directed [[Peter Weiss]]'s ''[[Marat/Sade]] (1978),'' [[Jean Genet]]'s ''The Maids,'' in two versions (1978) and [[Alexander Ostrovsky]] 's ''The Fools!''

In the cast were [[Eric Portman]] and [[Gloria Vanderbilt]].  Off-Broadway in the 60's, he directed [[Jacques Audiberti|Jaques Audiberti]] 's ''The Chinabird'',  [[Michel de Ghelderode]]'s ''Women at the Tomb'' and ''Escurial'', [[Robert Helpmann|Robert Hellman]]'s ''Kling'', and ''Saint Joan'' by [[George Bernard Shaw]]; in Berlin, he directed Bertolt Brecht's ''Mann ist Mann and Arturo Ui'' at the Berliner Ensemble (1969).\n\nDuring the Vietnam War, Lion became deeply involved with the anti-war movement and served as artistic director and ''agent provocateur'' of New York's [[Washington Square Methodist Episcopal Church]] (1967\u20131970), which gave sanctuary to that war's first draft resisters.  He directed the church's 1967 Christmas celebration condemning the war, which was broadcast nationwide.  Under the leadership of Lion and the Rev. Finley Schaef, the church provided a home for insurgent theatre companies such as [[Jerzy Grotowski]]'s Polish Lab and the [[Bread and Puppet Theater|Bread and Puppet Theatre,]] as well as the Greenwich Village Peace Center with [[Karl Bissinger]], and an Ecology Center.

Raymond \"Red\" Reddington ([[James Spader]]), a former government agent turned high-profile criminal, who had eluded capture for decades, voluntarily surrenders to the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]], offering to cooperate on capturing a list of criminals who are virtually impossible to catch. He insists on working with a rookie profiler by the name of Elizabeth Keen ([[Megan Boone]]). The show also stars [[Diego Klattenhoff]], [[Ryan Eggold]] and [[Harry Lennix]]. The pilot episode was written by [[Jon Bokenkamp]] and directed by [[Joe Carnahan]]. Executive producers for the series include Bokenkamp, [[John Eisendrath]], and [[John Davis (producer)|John Davis]] for [[Sony Pictures Television]], [[Universal Television]], and [[Davis Entertainment]].

It is later revealed that Reddington was accused of committing treason by leaking information to the [[Soviet Union]] which led to the death of several American naval officers. Nicknamed \"the [[concierge]] of crime\", Reddington is known for brokering deals between criminals. He willingly surrenders to the FBI and provides information on a roster of criminals that he refers to as ''The Blacklist'': dangerous criminals who are so careful to avoid leaving any traces behind that the FBI has not even detected their existence. His ethics are somewhat murky, and he espouses the use of some crimes (such as extortion, counterfeiting, torture, and murder) in the service of \"the greater good\". He uses his arrangement with the FBI to pursue his own secret agenda; it was revealed that he needed their help to find [[#Milos Kirchoff, \"Berlin\"|Berlin]], a mysterious nemesis who had been attacking his organization.\n\nHe has an unexplained interest in Elizabeth Keen and knows personal secrets about her that she has never made public. He will stop at nothing to protect her and even went as far as to block her memories of the fire she was trapped in. But she finally regains them and learns that when her father attacked her mother, she killed him while still a child. Red explains that he never wanted Liz to end up like him and was trying to prevent that. He had a romantic affair with Liz's mother, Katarina Rostova, and it is implied several times that he may be Liz's biological father. No proof of this is ever shown, and Red himself initially denies it when directly confronted by Liz, although he does claim that he knew her father well. Red is confirmed as Liz's father in \"Dr. Adrian Shaw: Conclusion\", and in \"Mr. Kaplan: Conclusion\", he finally acknowledges this to Liz after she presents him with a DNA test confirming his paternity. In \"Monarch Douglas Bank\", it was revealed that Red used to be married to Naomi Hyland and has a daughter named Jennifer. In \"Dr. Linus Creel\", when he confronted Naomi about her, he discovers that Jennifer left her after her marriage to Frank and hasn't tried to make contact since then.\n\nAfter the death of [[#Alan Fitch, \"The Decembrist\"|Alan Fitch]], Reddington comes into conflict with the Director, the new head of the Cabal. The Director did not believe that Reddington had the Fulcrum, a blackmail file which Reddington had used as leverage to force a stalemate with the Cabal, and wanted to end the d\u00e9tente and kill Reddington. In response, Reddington urgently began seeking the Fulcrum, and managed to collect various items needed to decrypt it. Finally, after he confessed to Liz that he had initially hired [[#Tom Keen|Tom Keen]] to enter her life and watch over her, she gave him the Fulcrum, after which he was shot by the Director's agents. However, he survived. He continued to throw obstacles into Liz's path as she sought to find out more about her mother. When Liz was framed by the Cabal for the assassination of Senator Hawkins, Reddington countered by gathering 11 of the world's top investigative journalists and giving them the information contained in the Fulcrum. He later helped Liz go on the run after she assassinated [[United States Attorney General|Attorney General]] Tom Connolly, a member of the Cabal.\n\nAccompanied by Liz, Reddington goes on the run to gather various resources needed for his plan to bring down the Director and exonerate Liz. He eventually succeeds in forcing the Cabal to abandon the Director, and then kills him. However, Red is unable to clear Liz completely of the killing of Tom Connolly and she only returns to the taskforce as an asset like Red himself. He meets with Laurel Hitchin, who suggests he weakened the Cabal so that they would invite him to join it.\n\nAfter watching Liz die in his arms Dembe convinces Red to leave the van containing her body and Ressler places his FBI windbreaker around Red's shoulders and leads him over to the car with Dembe. As Ressler lets go of Red's arm and Red goes to get into the car he collapses and Dembe catches him saying: \"I got you.\" And proceeded to help Red into the car. After being told to stay away from Agnes by Tom in \"Cape May\", Red goes on a self-imposed exile to get away from everything and find better means to cope with Liz's death. He rescues a woman who attempted suicide one time and takes her back to the abandoned hotel. Only when a man talks to Red at the beach, that he realized the woman he rescued was a ghost and it was she who tells him that he did save her, through channeling his grief in losing Liz. In \"The Artax Network\", Red finally visits Dom, the father of Katarina, and while he still blames him for what he done, Dom reluctantly allows Red to stay. When Aram tracks him down to try and convince Red to help them again, he refuses to leave and sends Aram on his way. Dom later convinces Red to leave and honor his word to the FBI, saying that Red's got good people who count on him. As a token of gratitude, Red fixes a C\u266f key on Dom's piano and leaves. Red later visits Aram and tells him they have work to do.\n\nIn \"Dr. Adrian Shaw: Conclusion\", while Red is being held captive and threatened by Alexander Kirk, Red admits that he is in fact Elizabeth Keen's father. As Kirk goes to kill him, Red whispers something to Kirk that changes his mind and the two men disappear by the time the FBI arrive. Red later tells Liz that Kirk is \"gone\" but doesn't elaborate further and doesn't tell her that he's her father.\n\nIn \"Lipet's Seafood Company\" Red is berated by Cooper for letting Alexander Kirk go, but Red tells him that Kirk is gone and won't be coming back and moves on. Red works to meet with the President-Elect to whose campaign he contributed in exchange for his help with the Alexander Kirk situation and is eventually able to secure a [[Presidential pardon]] for Liz killing Tom Connolly. As a result, Liz is able to be reinstated as an FBI agent.\n\nIn \"The Apothecary\", Red is poisoned and needs the FBI to find Asa Hightower, the man who poisoned him. When confronting Marvin Gerard for not being at the dinner, he learns that Dembe has left him.\n\nIn \"Dembe Zuma\" Red finds out that Dembe left his side to find the traitor in his syndicate. Aram helps him out by procuring one name, Kathryn Nemec, whom Red recognizes as Mr. Kaplan. When confronting the man who housed her and shot Dembe, Red and Baz discovered he wired a bomb and escaped as he died in his house.\n\nIn \"Requiem\", Kaplan calls Red and he confronts her for hiding Liz from him. She tells him she needed to do what she should've done years ago in keeping Liz away from him and mentions that she has just begun her revenge. When Red tries to claim that she helped build his syndicate tight, Kaplan reminds him that she is the one who knows where the bodies of the people he had killed are buried and that she hid them from the FBI over the years, including that of Diane Fowler. This makes Red worried when Kaplan reveals that they can be used to not only attack his syndicate, but also destroy him from within.\n\nIn \"Mr. Kaplan\", many of Red's associates have broken rank and joined Kaplan in her plans for revenge. He also learns that Julian Gale, a rogue FBI agent, is working with her to procure the immunity deal between Red and the FBI. Red tries to appeal to Kaplan to end the war, but she refused, telling him that Liz needs to know the truth.\n\nIn \"Mr. Kaplan, Conclusion\", Red takes Ressler to Hitchin's cleaner, Henry Prescott, to help him find a barrel marked back two years ago. When they open it, Red tells Ressler that he had just found Reven Wright. With the evidence, he and Ressler appeal to Hitchin for help. When she tried to refuse, Red tells her that unless she wants to be held accountable for both the Task Force's downfall and the murder of Wright, she better uphold her end of the bargain and end the indictment on the Task Force. Red tries to appeal to Kaplan again at the bridge, promising he won't shoot her. He is shocked when she decided to jump to her own death. Later on, Red is confronted by Liz who tells him that she now knows he's her father. At Tansi Farms, Red and Dembe discover the suitcase buried there is gone and that they must get it back before Liz discovers the truth about how her mother, Katarina Rostova, died.\n\nIn \"Ian Garvey: Conclusion\", despite taking Garvey hostage and en route to collecting the skeletal remains of Katarina, Ian rams his sedan into another car, leaving Red and Dembe there as he escapes. Red later confronts Garvey after learning that the latter now knows that Liz is his daughter. Only then, Jennifer confronts Red for what he's done and the fact that Ian saved her and Naomi's life from their disappointment when they learned of his criminal career. Red then recognizes her from all the years. Despite Garvey shooting first, Red fires back and shoots him.\n\nIn \"Sutton Ross\", Red recovers the bag of bones and burns it in the presence of Dembe and Katarina's father Dom. However, unknown to Red, Liz was conspiring with Ross and Red's daughter Jennifer to learn the truth. Visited by a hallucination of Tom, Liz reveals what she has learned. The bones in the duffle bag may belong to the real Reddington and the man known as Reddington is possibly an imposter who murdered everyone who tried to reveal the truth to Liz.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://tvline.com/2018/05/16/the-blacklist-recap-season-5-finale-bones-identity-revealed|accessdate=May 24, 2018|date=May 16, 2018|title=The Blacklist Season 5 Finale Recap: Whose Bones Are in That Bag?}}</ref>\n\nIn \"Rassvet\", it is revealed that the real Raymond Reddington was killed by Liz as a child, an event she had remembered in \"Tom Connoly\" and thought was Alexander Kirk. The imposter's real name is revealed to be '''Ilya Koslov''' by Dominic Wilkinson. He is a childhood friend of Katarina Rostova, the love of his life and her occasional lover. Knowing that the Cabal would work to discredit Reddington and his evidence against them, Ilya took on his identity and became Raymond Reddington to prevent this and protect himself and Katarina. Dom tells Liz that Ilya underwent multiple [[plastic surgery|plastic surgeries]] over the course of a year to change his appearance to match Reddington's and information from Katarina to fill in the blanks. After learning the truth, Liz visits him in Hong Kong where Reddington points out that her search cost him his relationship with Dembe and refuses to answer why he continued his masquerade after gaining access to Reddington's money. He later confronts Dom and demands to know exactly what Dom had told Liz, word for word.\n\nIn \"Orion Relocation Services,\" he is revealed to not in fact be Ilya Koslov while Reddington's friend Frank Bloom is in fact the real Ilya. In \"Katarina Rostova,\" Katarina tells Liz that even she doesn't know who the imposter actually is and Dom lied to Liz about Reddington's true identity.\n\n=== Elizabeth Keen ===\n[[File:The Blacklist - Megan Boone (cropped).jpg|thumb|170px|Elizabeth Keen is portrayed by [[Megan Boone]], since 2013]]\nPortrayed by [[Megan Boone]]\n\n'''Elizabeth Scott Keen''' is an FBI profiler. According to Reddington and the FBI, her birth name is '''Masha Rostova''', and she was born in Moscow to Katarina Rostova, a Russian intelligence agent whom everyone regards as a \"myth\". Elizabeth has a mysterious and traumatic past: her wrist bears a large scar from a fire she was trapped in as a child, and her only memory of her biological father is of him rescuing her from the fire. Reddington admitted to blocking her memories of the fire. She eventually regains her memory of the event when she killed her father to protect her mother. Reddington had been trying to protect her from the knowledge when he blocked her memories.\n\nShe is the only person with whom Reddington is willing to work. She has yet to learn why, but he has told her that it has something to do with her missing father. While her adoptive father lay dying in the hospital, he insists to Red that Liz \"deserves to know\", but his death is hastened by Red to prevent Liz from \"knowing\". She develops a bond with Reddington as they continue to work together. The Director indicates there is a close personal connection between Liz and Red, but refuses to tell her what it is. Her once-idyllic marriage to Tom Keen unraveled as she discovered evidence that he was not the man he appeared to be. After she found out he was an agent hired by Berlin to keep her under surveillance, she had the marriage annulled. She kept Tom imprisoned on an abandoned ship for several months, interrogating him. Eventually, she was forced to let him go in exchange for Berlin's location after he murdered a harbormaster, Eugene Ames.\n\nLocal police investigated Ames' murder and had enough evidence to arrest Liz for her involvement; but she was saved by the intervention of Reddington, Cooper, then-assistant AG Connolly, and Tom himself. She also learned that she was the key to unlocking the mysteries of the Fulcrum, and that she had unknowingly had the Fulcrum itself in her possession since childhood. With the help of Leonard Caul, she deciphered the Fulcrum's contents and confronted the Director with them. She was then unknowingly infected with a customized biological weapon by the Cabal and tricked into infecting their target, Senator Hawkins. The Cabal then framed her for Hawkins's assassination and for being a Russian spy. After shooting Tom Connolly upon learning of his involvement with the faking of Cooper's cancer and the Cabal's sinister intentions for the other agents on the task force, Elizabeth is now a fugitive on the FBI's Most Wanted List. To evade capture by the FBI, she sought asylum at the Russian embassy, identifying herself as \"Masha Rostova\" and pretending to be a Russian spy.\n\nIn \"Marvin Gerard\", as Liz is being escorted to the airport, the convoy is attacked by Ressler and forcing Liz to run on foot. At a diner, she confronts Red for preventing her asylum until she learns he did this to save her life from being killed by the Cabal. While holding everyone in the diner hostage, Liz attacks an abusive boyfriend of one of the hostages' and nearly kills him until Red stops her. In \"Eli Matchett\", Liz comes to the realization that even if her name is cleared, it's impossible for her to go back to the life she once knew and must rely on Red to help her survive as a criminal. In \"Arioch Cain\", Liz and Red fake her death, after a bounty is put on Liz's head.\n\nIn \"Kings of the Highway\", Liz tracks down Reddington after he is kidnapped and ransoms him using a valuable object that Dembe claims is needed to clear her name. While Liz and Dembe are making the exchange for Reddington, the FBI arrives, and Ressler arrests Liz.\n\nIn \"The Director\", Liz is locked in the task force's cell as Ressler tries to protect her until she can testify. The Director and Laurel Hitchin attempt to prevent this by transferring Liz to an undisclosed location due to her supposedly having terrorist connections and then suffocating her when Aram changes the box's door code. Liz is nearly transferred, but the White House Counsel is able to prevent it and Ressler returns to transfer her to the courthouse. In \"The Director: Conclusion\", Liz spends the night in a cell protected by Ressler which keeps the Cabal from reaching her, but Laurel plots to have her assassinated as she's moved. Liz is later taken before a judge where she faces multiple charges that each come with a death sentence, including sixteen counts of murder. Laurel tries to have Liz assassinated, but is forced to call off her attempt by Red who captures the Director and threatens to turn him over to the World Court. With the help of Marvin Gerard, Red makes a deal with Laurel for her to publicly exonerate Liz on all but Tom Connolly's murder. In that case, Liz had to plead guilty to [[involuntary manslaughter]] and would get three years' probation. Though she would be free, Liz could never return to the FBI. Liz reluctantly took the deal in the end as Red ensured she'd remain part of the task force as an asset like him. Liz was publicly exonerated by Laurel while Karakurt was taken into custody and exposed as the man who had committed the terrorist acts Liz had been framed for. That night, Liz emerges from the courthouse a free woman and hugs Red who is waiting for her.\n\nLiz has difficulty adjusting to no longer being an FBI agent. After being beaten up by a man who thought she was a traitor, she is hospitalized and discovers she is pregnant. She accepts Tom's marriage proposal, hoping to start a family with him.\n\nLiz and Tom's wedding ceremony is interrupted by Mr. Solomon, who pursues them relentlessly. Liz is injured during the chase, forcing Reddington's doctor to perform an emergency C-section to save her baby. Liz dies due to complications with the C-section and the inability to reach a hospital on time: Matias Solomon blocks the vehicle containing Liz from continuing on to the hospital and Liz dies with Reddington holding her hand. Red is shown to be completely devastated by her death, as is the rest of the task force, and Tom is left to raise their daughter, Agnes, alone. In \"Cape May\" Red tells of a time he had to make a Hobson's choice: to save a child and lose her mother or lose both, saying it was the hardest choice he made by far in his life. While it initially seems he is referring to Liz' recent death, a later conversation reveals that the allusion was toward saving Liz (n\u00e9e Masha) as a child and losing her mother, Katarina.\n\nIn \"Alexander Kirk: Conclusion\", Liz is revealed to be alive, her death having been faked by Kaplan to protect her and Agnes. Liz is reunited with Tom and Agnes in [[Cuba]], but is captured by Alexander Kirk's men. Tied to a chair, Liz meets with Kirk who reveals he is in fact her father.\n\nIn \"Esteban\" Liz doesn't believe Kirk and demands to know what he's planning to do with her, Tom and Agnes. Kirk claims that her daughter will be fine and that he just needs to get rid of the rat. Kirk plans to take her back to the house she grew up in so she can see the truth for herself. In \"Mato\" Liz gets a clue from her past when she saw her mother, Katarina, putting a few toys and a ribbon bracelet in a coffee can used as a time machine. Liz digs the can up and discovers some truth in Kirk's words. When she is rescued by the FBI, Liz is reunited with Tom. In \"Miles McGrath\", Liz reads through her mother's journal and comes up to an important clue involving a rare cancer plaguing the males of the Rostov family. It was only then Red reveals the truth in Kirk's plans to use Liz for a blood transfusion as her blood contains vital blood cells needed to help him replenish his own and without her, he will keep Agnes hostage.\n\nIn \"The Lindquist Concerns\", Liz discovers a DNA test done by Kirk which claimed her to be his daughter and briefly mistrusted Red for it. In \"The Thrushes\", Liz helps Red talk Kirk out of committing suicide by begging him to give Agnes back to her. He does give her back to Liz that leads to his arrest.\n\nIn \"Dr. Adrian Shaw\", Kirk is taken to the hospital and believing she may be his only chance of rescuing him, goes through a DNA Test. If she is found to be a match, they will prepare her for surgery and do a blood transfusion. When Tom found out, he confronted Liz for the decision and admitted that he had met his mother, Susan, months earlier. Despite his warning not to get close to Kirk, Liz mentioned that she needs to help him as he may provide the answers to who she is. While being prepped for surgery, a doctor tells her that the DNA test results between her and Kirk came back and they're not a match. Believing Red had sent false transcripts of the DNA test, she calls him to confront him only to discover that Kirk had lied to her the whole time and the DNA transcript that Tom gave her was falsified. Angered by this, Liz confronts Kirk for lying to her and abandons him. In \"Dr. Adrian Shaw: Conclusion\", while Red is being held captive and threatened by Kirk, Red tells Kirk that he (Red) is Elizabeth Keen's father (\"What do you want me to say? Yes. Yes, Elizabeth is my daughter.\u201d).\n\nIn \"Lipet's Seafood Company\", Red is able to secure a [[Presidential pardon]] for Liz's killing of Connolly, allowing Cooper to reinstate her as an FBI agent.\n\nIn \"Dr. Bogdan Krilov\", Liz and Samar are sent to confront Dr. Krilov and discover Kaplan's plan to use Ressler to kill Hitchin as she is Red's only link to the Cabal under false pretenses. Liz discovers the truth about Kaplan being her former nanny whom she used to call as Katya and she begs Liz to end her relationship with Red before it's too late. Despite stopping Ressler from making a big mistake, Liz confronts Hitchin and tells her they will investigate in Reven Wright's disappearance. Inside the ice rink, Liz finally meets with Julian Gale who demands the FBI transcripts of their involvement with Red. She refuses to cooperate and suspects he has an ulterior motive in wanting the transcripts so he can capture Red.\n\nIn \"The Debt Collector\" Liz is kidnapped by Edgar Grant who was presumably hired by a man she had arrested previously that forced Red to cooperate with Kaplan. When he takes her to the cabin to meet with his client, Liz and Grant are taken by surprise when Red shows up. Despite Liz's attempts to help Red reconcile with Kaplan, a gun shot is fired by an unknown assailant. Liz later calls Red and informs him of her suspicion on Gale being his assailant.\n\nIn \"Mr. Kaplan Conclusion\", Liz is informed by Harold that he had done a DNA test between her and Red and she'll know within 24 hours if he is her father. She later tries to appeal to Kaplan to end the war with Red and she wants to show her a secret. On their way there, Red's men block the attempt and despite Kaplan's warning not to leave the car, Liz does. After opening an envelope containing the DNA test and believing it to be Kaplan's secret, Liz confronts Red for not telling her the truth about him being her father and having to find out from Cooper. She tells him that she was upset that she had already lost her mother, her nanny and Sam the people who knew her the best. Despite this, Liz mentions that she can't let Red deny the fact that she's just like him and anger, despair and love is part of a normal family. Liz also comes to the realization that Red wanted her to grow more as a FBI profiler and embraces him.\n\nIn \"Zarak Mosadek\", while staking out at a pub in Baltimore with Aram, Liz discovers a woman named Lillian who works as a bartender meeting with Garvey.

His father was an honest policeman who was betrayed and killed by his corrupt partner after refusing to take bribes. He spent five years on an FBI task force obsessively pursuing Reddington, which resulted in his fianc\u00e9e's breaking off their engagement. He despises having to work with a criminal like Reddington, but he acknowledges that Reddington does get results. Initially he distrusts Liz Keen and her connection to Reddington, but eventually comes to respect and work well with her. After he was shot by Anslo Garrick, he reignited his relationship with his former fianc\u00e9e, Audrey Bidwell. However, in \"Mako Tanida\" she was believed to be killed by Mako Tanida and forcing Ressler to side with Red to find him. After capturing him, Ressler and his friend, Bobby Jonica takes him to his father's secret cabin. On the drive there, Ressler is betrayed when Tanida informs him that he wasn't responsible for the deaths of both the FBI agents and Audrey's. He also learns that Jonica assumed Akio's(Tanida's deceased brother) identity to continue his business, leading the latter to shoot Tanida for exposing him and Ressler slamming the brakes to stop him. After capturing Jonica, Ressler blamed him for his betrayal that led to the deaths of their closest friends and Audrey. He also admits that while he doesn't like working with Red, he was the reason why Ressler had Audrey back in his life and because of Jonica, she's dead. Ressler gave him a choice to kill himself with a knife or Jonica will be shot. Liz convinces Ressler to stand down as Jonica kills himself with the knife. Back at his apartment, Ressler is heartbroken when he discovers a pregnancy test and learns that Audrey was pregnant with his child. He later developed an addiction to pain medication from what he went through with Audrey's death and later Meera's own. He managed to overcome it when Liz convinces Ressler to seek help.\n\nIn \"Tom Connolly\", with Cooper removed from being the FBI Director of Counterterrorism and finally being aware of the Cabal, Wright names Ressler as acting director. When Liz goes on the run after killing Tom Connolly, Ressler urges her to come in, saying that otherwise he will have to lead the FBI manhunt against her.\n\nIn \"The Troll Farmer\", Ressler interrogates Cooper for his involvement in letting Liz escape and learns a little bit of the Cabal's plans for the FBI itself. He eventually decides to release Cooper, but warns that they will keep an eye on him. In \"Marvin Gerard\", Red informs Ressler that the Cabal had set a trap up for Liz at the airport and he rushes in to prevent the departure. Though he succeeds, Liz is shaken up by his reckless actions, believing he wanted to capture her, and flees the scene before Ressler could explain himself. He is later visited by Tom Keen, wishing to assist him knowing trouble is on the horizon for both Red and Liz. In \"Eli Matchett\", Ressler refuses his help and warns Tom to stay out of his way.\n\nAfter arresting Liz, Ressler joins Red's efforts to protect her from the Cabal, aiding in protecting Karakurt in \"the Director\". He later tells Liz that he believes she was framed and he would not have arrested her if he believed he couldn't protect her. Ressler is able to protect Liz until Red forces the Cabal to exonerate her. He then returns control of the task force to the reinstated Cooper.\n\nIn the season 4 episode \"Philomena\", Ressler's old friend Julian Gale invites Ressler to join his investigation into the eighty-six bodies exhumed by Mr. Kaplan.

When he delved further, the woman admitted she saw a foot come out of the carpet, leading Reesler to suspect that Hitchin murdered Wright. Before he could take the woman into protective custody, Ressler and her are attacked by men presumably working for Hitchin. However, Liz and Samar suspect he was being manipulated by Kaplan after Krilov confesses. They stop Ressler just in time from killing Hitchin and Liz revealing he was under the influence of [[propofol]] and manipulated to kill Hitchin by Kaplan and Krilov. Despite standing down, Ressler is later taken into custody with his FBI badge revoked.\n\nIn \"The Debt Collector\", when he is accused by Gale for wanting to help Red, Ressler reprimands him for being selfish. He points out to Gale that he was on another assignment by looking into Wright's murder and had no time to deal with Red's shenanigans. Ressler lost his badge upon being under the influence of propofol and nearly killed Hitchin had Liz and Samar not stopped him. The last thing he needed is Gale causing him more problems with his life. He later apologizes to Ressler upon learning what happened to him.\n\nIn \"Mr. Kaplan\", Ressler informs Cooper, Liz, and Samar that Gale has gotten enough intel to demand an indictment on the Task Force involving Red, from the grand jury.\n\nIn \"Mr. Kaplan, Conclusion\", Red helps Ressler locate Henry Prescott and later finds the murdered Reven Wright. At the end and inside her home, Ressler didn't agree to Hitchin's demands and pushed her towards a chair, killing her. He later calls Prescott to help hide Hitchin's body in a similar manner to Wright's, under the pseudonym Red gave Ressler, Frank Sturgeon.\n\nIn \"Smokey Putnum\", Ressler is informed by Cooper that Hitchin died by hitting her head and there will be no further investigation.

With Red's help, Ressler discovered Prescott's real name and meets him in the park where he's playing football with his family and arrests him. Afterwards, he gives Cooper a letter of resignation and includes his confession for all the things he's done. Cooper rejects the letter, stating that his name wasn't found on Prescott's client list. Prescott is later killed by Reddington.\n\n=== Tom Keen ===\n[[File:Ryan Eggold.jpg|thumb|170px|Tom Keen is portrayed by [[Ryan Eggold]], since 2013]]\nPortrayed by [[Ryan Eggold]]\n\n'''Thomas Vincent Keen''', born '''Christopher Hargrave''' (Blacklister No. 7), originally from Couva, is Elizabeth's husband, an elementary school teacher who turns out to be a covert operative working for [[#Milos Kirchoff, \"Berlin\"|Berlin]]. When first confronted by Elizabeth, Tom asserts to her that he was assigned to protect her, and that Reddington \"is not who [she] think he is\". Elizabeth shoots him and stages his death, but keeps him prisoner on a boat for several months to extract as much information as possible. When she is nearly discovered by the harbor master, Tom saves her by strangling him to death; as a token of gratitude, she lets Tom escape. Tom later meets with Reddington and their conversation reveals a previous working relationship. Apparently, Tom was recruited at the age of 14 (he was then known as Jacob Phelps) by a blacklister known as The Major ([[Lance Henriksen]]) due to the combination of sociopathy and extreme talent, to be groomed for covert operations. Reddington acquired him from The Major to insert him into Elizabeth's life, but when Berlin found out, he doubled Reddington's price. After his escape, Tom utilizes The Major for a new covert operation as a [[neo-Nazi]] drug and arms dealer in [[Dresden]] named Christof Mannheim, but not before calling Elizabeth; he appears to have developed genuine feelings for her during their \"marriage\", which seems to complicate matters for both The Major and Reddington, as it was the reason behind his killing the harbor master on Elizabeth's boat. When Elizabeth nearly gets subpoenaed for the harbor master's murder, Reddington and Ressler attempt to extradite Tom from Germany so he can clear her name; Tom initially refuses, but then appears in court and willfully surrenders. With the help of Assistant Attorney General, \"Smiling Tommy\" Connolly, Reddington helps Tom and Elizabeth sweep the whole event under the rug; Elizabeth is cleared while Tom \"never existed\". The Major, seeing Tom as a liability after this affair, tries to shoot Tom but the Germans intercept them; Tom bargains for their lives and they both manage to escape, but The Major is still set to have Tom killed. Desperate, Tom hides at Elizabeth's place and pleads her to give him his passports; in exchange, she convinces him to tell her the truth about his relationship with Reddington, then reveals that she had always known that on some level, Tom's love for her and their life together was genuine. He later tells Liz of his dream to become a fisherman and urges her to come with him to Japan to start a new life with each other, but she declines, telling him that she needs to finish what she's started. After Liz kills Tom Connolly and becomes one of the FBI's most wanted, Tom departs on his boat to Japan to begin his new life.\n\nIn \"Marvin Gerard\", Tom appears before Ressler, wishing to help assist him in saving Liz, suspecting the tides are against Red's favor.

Posing as a hustler, he befriends a wealthy socialite and infiltrates an underground street-fighting ring, where he eventually locates Karakurt. He brings the assassin to Cooper, but the Cabal finds them, forcing all three men to go on the run. Eventually, with Ressler and Cooper's help, he evades the Cabal and delivers Karakurt into federal custody. After Liz is released, Tom proposes marriage to her, but she turns him down, saying that she is too uncertain about the future to accept. Tom is later confronted by Red who warns him to stay away from Liz, after the actions he pulled when he ignored his first warning that led to this. After Liz's death, he tells Red to stay away from Agnes and blames him for his failure to protect her.\n\nIn \"The Artax Network\", Samar visits Tom in the hospital who has been having a hard time raising Agnes alone and offers to help him.

During the mission, Tom shoots Solomon in revenge, but Solomon seemingly gets away after Tom leaves. Tom later goes after Susan before Red calls him to stop Tom. Red reveals that Tom is in fact Christopher Hargrave, Susan's long-missing son. Moments later, Susan enters and tells him about her son, how he disappeared twenty-eight years earlier when he was three years old and she always hopes to see him again. On Red's advice, Tom doesn't let Susan know he's her son but doesn't kill her for Agnes' sake.\n\nIn \"The Lindquist Concern\" Tom suspects Kirk is manipulating Liz and seeks out Ressler's help for previous files from the FBI. Though still unable to trust him, Ressler agreed to help Tom out by giving him previous FBI files.

He also learns that Susan had faked Howard's death and had an ulterior motive for Halycon.

Solomon tries to stop Tom and Nez, claiming that Susan was set up by Howard and had no knowledge on it.\n\nIn \"Mr. Kaplan, Conclusion\", it's revealed that Tom found the suitcase Kaplan left in the storage locker and looks inside it.

After learning she was involved with Elizabeth Keen's death, Reddington attacks Hargrave's operations to force her to meet with him. She agrees, setting a trap for him. Reddington is alerted to the trap by Tom, and turns the tables, capturing Hargrave instead. She denies any responsibility in Liz's death, but reveals that she was contracted to capture Liz by a man named Alexander Kirk. Reddington then proposes a temporary alliance with her.\n\nHargrave, Solomon, and Nez Rowan team up with Reddington, Tom, and the task force to steal $300&nbsp;million from Senator Diaz, a presidential candidate who is being bankrolled by Kirk, in an attempt to draw Kirk out. Impressed by Tom's skills, she offers to hire him as an employee of Halcyon.\n\nIn \"Ruin,\" Hargrave returns to visit a newly widowed Liz, having been exonerated for the crimes her husband framed her for through Tom's testimony. She takes temporary custody of Agnes while Liz deals with her anger and grief.\n\n=== Nez Rowan ===\nPortrayed by [[Tawny Cypress]]\n\nA mercenary who works for Susan Hargrave. Nez has struggled with addiction before and during the series she relapses.\n\n===Matias Solomon===\n[[File:Edi Gathegi.jpg|thumb|170px|Matias Solomon is portrayed by [[Edi Gathegi]], since 2015]]\nPortrayed by [[Edi Gathegi]]\n\n'''Matias Solomon''' (Blacklister No. 32) is a high-ranking Cabal operative. He was formerly a CIA asset in Ethiopia, working with Laurel Hitchin, but the agency ended its relationship with him when he proved to be too brutal even for them. He is soft-spoken and courteous but highly sadistic, with a predilection for torturing his victims.\n\nIn \"The Troll Farmer\", he takes Dembe's granddaughter hostage and uses her to capture Dembe. He visits Peter Kotsiopulos' office as a representative of the Cabal, reprimanding the Director for his inability to prevent Reddington from releasing the Fulcrum and threatening that continued failure would mean his life. He viciously tortures Dembe for information on Reddington's location, but fails to break him. Through a deception involving Mr. Vargas, Solomon finally tricks Dembe into revealing the information and captures Reddington and Liz. However, Dembe rescues them and drives Solomon off. In \"Sir Crispin Crandall\", while trying to fire at Red and Liz, he finds himself trapped with all of the most intelligent people in cryogenics. Solomon visits Peter again and warns him of his position in the Cabal. Peter then reprimands him for trying to revolt and forces Solomon's cooperation. In \"Zal Bin Hassan\" Solomon traces Tom down to Wing Yee in the hopes of ambushing Liz and Tom, but instead is caught by the FBI. During interrogation, the Director tortures Solomon by forcing him to swallow fishhooks, a ruse intended to convince the FBI that the Director is not in league with him. Solomon is then released.\n\nLater, Solomon leads an assault team to kill Karakurt, who is being held by Tom Keen, Cooper, and Ressler. He captures Tom at gunpoint and demands that Ressler hand Karakurt over. However, Cooper knocks him out from behind, and Ressler arrests him.\n\nWhile being transported by federal agents, Solomon is rescued by an unknown person driving a Rolls Royce. Then, working for Susan Hargrave, he plots to steal a nuclear weapon. This plot turns out to be a decoy to divert the FBI's attention from his real mission: capturing Liz Keen. He and his men surround the church where Liz and Tom are about to be married and demand that Liz come with them or they will kill everyone else and take her by force. However, Reddington, Tom, and the task force members are able to fend off Solomon's men long enough for Ressler to come to the rescue, allowing Liz and Tom to escape. He chases Liz again after her escape and hunts her ambulance as Red tries to take her to the hospital to save her life. Solomon is able to disable Red's vehicle and pins him and his men down. Eventually FBI backup arrives and Solomon flees as his men are killed. However, the delay in getting to the hospital caused by Solomon's attack causes Liz to apparently die due to complications during childbirth.\n\nIn \"Alexander Kirk\", Solomon and Tom are forced to work together in an operation to take down Blacklister Alexander Kirk who had orchestrated the attack on Liz. During the mission, Tom and Solomon rob a pharmacy together and Tom shoots Solomon in the gut in revenge for the attempt on Liz's life. Minutes later the police enter to find a pool of blood but no sign of Solomon himself.\n\n== The Blacklist ==\nThe '''Blacklist''' is a list of criminals that Raymond Reddington has compiled in his illegal business dealings. Names on the list are criminals that the FBI does not have overwhelming evidence against, hence why they have never been caught. Some criminals are unknown to the FBI, or have avoided leaving behind the needed evidence for conviction, or live a high-profile public life whilst concealing their criminal behaviour.\n\nThe list is truly international with at least several members from [[Serbia]], China, Russia, (Germany), United Kingdom, Japan, [[Iran]], [[Uzbekistan]], etc., in addition to those from the United States.\n\nIt is unknown how many members the list contains, but the highest number revealed on the list so far is 192 in the comic book series and 184 in the TV series.\n\nIt is unknown what criteria Red is using to determine each member's position on the Blacklist, but most of the lowest numbers revealed so far (e. g. Katarina Rostova, No. 3, Mr. Kaplan, No. 4, Tom Keen, No. 7, Berlin, No. 8, Dembe Zuma, No. 10) have been the subject of multi-episode story arcs, suggesting that lower numbers are more significant figures in the show's mythology. The identities of many of the lowest numbers on the Blacklist remain unrevealed to date.\n\nVarious Blacklisters are also (or used to be) members of the Cabal.\n\n{| <!-- class=\"wikitable sortable\" --> class=\"wikitable collapsible collapsed\" <!-- class=\"wikitable nowraplinks\" --> style=\"width:99%;\"\n|-\n! style=\"background:#CFC; color:black;\" colspan=\"8\"| {{center|Raymond Reddington's Blacklist}}\n|-\n! style=\"width:1%;\"|No.\n!! style=\"width:4%;\"|Blacklister(s)\n!! style=\"width:1%;\"|Origin\n!! style=\"width:7%;\"|Career\n!! style=\"width:1%;\"|Status\n!! style=\"width:3%;\"|Actor(s)\n!! style=\"width:5%;\"|Appearance\n|-\n<!-- | 1\n| [[#The Cabal|The Cabal]]\n| [[File:Flag of None.svg|26px]]\n| \n* Clandestine organization\n* Main enemy of Raymond Reddington\n* \n| Active\n| style=\"background:#ececec; color:gray; vertical-align:middle; text-align:center;\" class=\"table-na\"|\n| Entire series\n|-\n|2||?||||||||\n|- -->\n|3\n| [[#Katarina Rostova|Katarina Rostova]]\n| {{flagicon|Russia}}\n|\n* Former Russian spy\n* Biological mother of Elizabeth Keen\n| Active\n| [[Lotte Verbeek]] young Katarina Rostova\n[[Laila Robins]] present day\n|\n* \"Cape May\" (flashback)\n* \"Mato\" (flashback)\n* \"Miles McGrath\" (flashback)\n* \"Requiem\" (flashback)\n* \"Rassvet\" (flashback)\n* \"Robert Diaz\"\n* [[The Blacklist (season 7)|Season 7]] (recurring)\n|-\n|4\n| [[#Mr. Kaplan|Kathryn Nemec<br><small>Mr. Kaplan</small>]]\n| {{flagicon|United States}}\n|\n*Raymond Reddington's cleaner\n*Former nanny to Liz\n|Deceased\n|[[Susan Blommaert]] present day\n[[Joanna P.

They first got a taste for blood working for Milo\u0161evi\u0107's protective detail during the ethnic cleansing campaigns of the Yugoslav Wars, but went on to operate independently with no political affiliation. Working together as a team, they used high firepower and ruthless tactics to achieve their goals.\n\nIn the series' pilot, they kidnapped Beth Ryker, the daughter of General Daniel Ryker, by killing six FBI Agents during the ambush.\n\nThey then kidnapped a Chinese scientist who had been rescued by the CIA. Later, Raymond Reddington hired them to kidnap Tom Keen. They delivered Tom to Elizabeth Keen. While attempting to smuggle Xiaoping Li back to China, they were killed at McKendrick Pier.\n\n=== Stanley Kornish, \"The Stewmaker\" ===\n[[File:10.17.09TomNoonanByLuigiNovi.jpg|thumb|170px|Stanley Kornish is portrayed by [[Tom Noonan]], in 2013 and 2013]]\nPortrayed by [[Tom Noonan]] (season 1, episode 4; season 2, episode 8)\n\n'''Stanley R. Kornish''' (Blacklister No. 161), a dentist by trade, had a separate career as a professional body disposal expert.

Raymond Reddington said she once contacted him for help in assassinating a Supreme Court judge. He also claimed that she was a former lover of Tom Keen. She worked for the Major.\n\nUsing the alias Shubie Hartwell, she entered the United States. She was hired by the Hanar Group to detonate a dirty bomb in the Port of Houston. The explosion would have allowed the Hanar investors to profit from the re-routing of sea shipping to New Orleans. After being captured, she was allowed a plea bargain since the bomb had not devastated the port. A search of her apartment produced a photograph of Tom Keen who she claims not to know. When questioned about the murder of Victor Fokin, she claims to have committed the crime on the orders of Raymond Reddington.\n\nGina is eventually released from prison. Tom contacts her, looking for work to provide for Liz and his unborn baby. Gina reluctantly brings him in to work on a jewelry heist. After they pull off the heist, she asks him to run away with her, and he refuses. She then double-crosses him and has him shot, but he survives. He then confronts her at gunpoint and demands that she persuade the Major to let him walk away from their organization, and she agrees.

He worked almost exclusively with a unit of highly armed, countryless mercenaries known as \"the Wild Bunch\". At some point, he raided a CIA blacksite in the Bering Sea to exfiltrate a man named Mahmoud al-Azok. His employer paid him to plant evidence that blamed the raid on Peruvian insurgent organization Shining Path (Sendero Luminoso, Communist Party of Peru, Partido Comunista del Per\u00fa). At some point he and Raymond Reddington worked together, though the alliance ended in 2008 when Garrick gave the FBI his train number and itenerary for a stop at Waterloo station in Brussels. Once Red arrived, a hit squad led by Donald Ressler made an attempt on his life, but failed. Red realized that Garrick had betrayed him and shot him in the face, damaging the right side of his face and apparently blinding his right eye. However, Garrick survived and spent 5 years in a prison described as a \"black hole\". To remind himself of the incident, Garrick never had the facial scarring repaired by surgery.\n\nHe was hired by Alan Fitch to kidnap Reddington. He succeeded in extracting Reddington from the FBI's custody, and tortured him. Reddington ultimately killed him by stabbing him in the neck in \"Anslo Garrick Conclusion\".\n\n=== Madeline Pratt ===\n[[File:Jennifer Ehle (30443863926).jpg|thumb|170px|Madeline Pratt is portrayed by [[Jennifer Ehle]]]]\nPortrayed by [[Jennifer Ehle]] <!-- (season 1, episode 14; season 2, episode 14) -->\n\n'''Madeline Pratt''' (Blacklister No. 73), outwardly, is a well-known and politically active socialite. Behind the facade, she forms relationships and affiliations with powerful, influential people and then uses those connections to commit million dollar heists. Reddington credits her with the theft of 6 million dollars' worth of diamonds from a De Beers outpost in Congo and a heist on a mint in Prague in which the security fibers used to print the Czech koruna were stolen and then used to print counterfeit banknotes. She had a previous romantic connection with Reddington, which he broke off.\n\nIn the first season, she poses as Red's widow to steal documents belonging to him worth 10&nbsp;million dollars from a bank in Istanbul to gain his attention regarding the proposed theft of the Effigy of Atargatis (leaving the first note). She met with Elizabeth Keen, whom Red had said was a career thief. After using Red and Liz as a diversion to allow her to steal the Effigy of Atargatis, she sold it to the Russian mafia after removing the Kungar 6 list. Red tricked her into revealing the location of the nuclear warheads and allowed her to escape. Later she stole a painting from Red as revenge (leaving the second note).\n\nIn the second-season episode \"T. Earl King VI\", Pratt was \"kidnapped\" by the Kings to bait Red into infiltrating \"The Palace\" so he could be sold at their auction.\n\n=== Milos Kirchoff, \"Berlin\" ===\n[[File:Peter Stormare.jpg|thumb|170px|Milos Kirchoff is portrayed by [[Peter Stormare]], in 2014]]\nPortrayed by [[Peter Stormare]] <!-- (seasons 1 and 2) -->\n\n'''Milos Kirchoff''' (Blacklister No. 8) is one of Reddington's nemeses between the first and second seasons.\n\nPrior to the series, Kirchoff started out in the [[Red Army]], rose to the rank of Colonel and later became a member of the [[KGB]]. Notorious for sending his enemies to the gulags in Siberia, he was a loyal servant of the [[Soviet Union]]. In 1991, near the end of the [[Cold War]], Kirchoff took part in a meeting in [[Kursk]] with other Soviet officials on how to combat their more progressive countrymen who wanted the Soviet Union dissolved. The meeting was interrupted when a bomb went off, killing 15 attendants and the last of the old Soviet resistance. The act was done by a man named Kiryl Morozov on the orders of Alan Fitch, known as \"The Decembrist\", but Reddington was blamed. Shortly after that, Kirchoff's daughter was suspected of falling in love with a dissident and imprisoned. He used his connections to help her escape, but the Kremlin found out and decided to use him as an example to the Motherland.\n\nHe was put in a Siberian gulag where a lot of people he had put away were imprisoned. One day, he was sent a pocket watch he had given his daughter. Over several months, he was sent several body parts and was led to believe that they were hers and that Reddington was behind it. In reality, Fitch sent body parts belonging to someone else and helped Kirchoff's daughter escape to the United States, but not before convincing her that her father was responsible for the bombing. Eventually, Kirchoff sharpened one of the bones he had been sent into a weapon, killed the people holding him captive and escaped and formed his criminal syndicate under the alias \"Berlin\".\n\nDuring the first eight episodes of the [[The Blacklist (season 2)|second season]], Red meets with Milos Kirchoff again, who once more blames him for his daughter's death and intends to hurt Red by going after Zoe, whom he assumes is Red's daughter. Red reveals that Milos Kirchoff's daughter Zoe is actually alive and someone else in Milos Kirchoff's faction had lied to him about her being killed. He is soon reunited with his daughter, who had been living under an assumed name as Zoe D'Antonio.\n\nIn the episode \"[[The Decembrist]]\", after being reunited with Zoe, Milos learned the truth of Red's innocence. He kills Kiryl Morozov after learning of Fitch's orders to frame Red and use Milos as a pawn. He was furious with Alan Fitch for lying to him about her death and takes action. Milos orders his agents to abduct Fitch and strap a pipe bomb on him, intending to kill him. Using Zoe to gain the access numbers to free Fitch, Red holds Milos at gunpoint. Red returns to the warehouse where he is holding Milos prisoner with a bottle of vodka and places 2 shot glasses in front of Milos. After they reminisce about the Cold War and finish the bottle, Red kills Milos.\n\n=== Luther Braxton ===\n[[File:Ron Perlman by Gage Skidmore 3.jpg|thumb|170px|Luther Braxton is portrayed by [[Ron Perlman]], in 2015]]\nPortrayed by [[Ron Perlman]] <!-- (season 2, episodes 9 and 10) -->\n\n'''Luther Todd Braxton''' (Blacklister No. 21) is a professional thief known for stealing money and information from China, Iran, and the United States.

After they threatened him to kill Elizabeth if he didn't talk his motives for his infiltration, Tom and makes a deal: in exchange for Liz would not be their target, he reveals his assignment: he's going to help them solve the murder of a woman named Sarah Hastings, who was affiliated to the Germans, which is the main reason they want revenge for her death.

While Gerard was being considered for a seat on the federal bench, his teenage son, Timothy, fell in with a bad crowd and, suffering emotional abuse from his mother, abused prescription drugs he got from her supply. Gerard separated from his wife and filed for custody, but since his wife came from an influential family, he wasn't able to. He eventually went so far as to kidnap Timothy to keep him away from his mother, for which he was disbarred and sentenced to 7\u201310 years at Federal Correctional Institution, Cumberland. Timothy hung himself a year later. Gerard continued doing legal work behind bars, serving as shadow counsel to politicians, CEOs, and high-profile criminals, including Reddington, who apparently consulted with Gerard before he turned himself in to the FBI against Gerard's strong objections.\n\nIn \"Sir Crispin Crandall\", Gerard locates the vault where Peter Kotsiopulos is keeping his embezzled money.\n\nIn \"The Director, Conclusion\", when Red puts together a team to exonerate Liz, he calls in Gerard as part of that team.

Once they have the Director, Red demands Laurel Hitchin exonerate Liz in exchange for Red not taking the Director to the Hague and sends in Gerard to discuss the terms of the deal with Laurel. Eventually Gerard manages to negotiate a deal where Liz is exonerated publicly for all but the Tom Connolly murder as Liz killed him in front of witnesses and it wasn't in self-defense. Instead, Laurel offers a plea of involuntary manslaughter with 3 years' probation. Gerard privately talks to Red and convinces him to take the deal as it will keep Liz safe and out of prison and is better than Gerard expected them to get. Gerard later presents the deal to Liz who reluctantly signs it as she will no longer able to be an FBI agent though she can remain on the task force in a similar capacity to Red. Thanks to Gerard's deal, Liz is later able to walk free. In \"The Apothecary\", Red believes Gerard poisoned him and is destroying his organization until it's revealed to be Dembe.

He resurfaced in America, where he abducted six technicians working on Israel's Iron Dome defense system. Posing as a hostage, he was reunited with his sister, claiming he had gone into hiding to avoid persecution.

During this time, Katarina was forced to kill a Soviet agent in self-defense; Kaplan disposed of the body. Later, Katarina tells Kaplan that Reddington kidnapped Liz, believing her to be his daughter. She was unaware that he took Liz to America to live with his family out of a need to protect both her and Katarina from not only Kirk/Rostov (who found out about the affair) but also Berlin/Kirchoff who was attacking him. Katarina rescued Liz, but was forced to flee when both the US and Russian governments began hunting her. She asked Kaplan to leave Liz in the care of the man who would become her foster father, Sam.\n\nIn \"Mr. Kaplan Conclusion\", before her suicide Kaplan prayed for Katarina to forgive her as she dug up the suitcase and left it in a storage locker. The suitcase was later retrieved by Tom Keen and opened it to discover skeletal remains that apparently belong to the real Raymond Reddington.\n\nIn \"Rassvet,\" it is revealed that Katarina was a double agent working both for the Cabal and the KGB. The real Reddington was the man shot by Liz on the night of the fire from which he was pulled by Katarina and her lover Ilya Koslov in an attempt to save Reddington's life. However, Reddington died of his injuries and the two covered up his death, leading to Reddington being declared missing. Katarina's apparent suicide was to fake her death, but her survival was exposed to Anton Velov when Katarina intervened to stop a rape at a shelter she was living at. After a brief period in hiding, she and Ilya traveled to Moscow to warn her father, who was also her KGB handler, to leave Russia to escape the Soviet government's reprisals for her treason. Later she tried to kill herself, but was stopped by Ilya. She then agreed to his proposal to assume Raymond Reddington's identity and gain access to his accounts, to protect her and her daughter Masha from the Cabal and to stop Reddington from being discredited as she knew he would be. In the present, Liz locates Katarina's father who reveals that twenty-eight years before, Katarina visited him and promised to send Dom a letter to a post office box once it was safe for her again. Though Dom checks every week, Katarina has not sent one letter despite it having been nearly thirty years.

After Liz discovers \"Madeleine\" is an imposter and confronts her at gunpoint, Katarina admits she is Liz's mother. Katarina abducts Liz and tells her that Frank Bloom, not Reddington, is the real Ilya Koslov, and that both Reddington and Dom are lying. Liz helps her escape when the FBI closes in on her location. Reddington is tailing Katarina when a car runs into her vehicle and two assassins shoot her and drag away the body.

So Kirk takes her to the house he claimed she grew up in, near Nova Scotia. When the FBI rescued her, Kirk decides to continue his revenge on Red by keeping Agnes from him.

Kirk intends to use Liz for a bone marrow transplant to save his own life. In \"Dr. Adrian Shaw\", Liz attempts to save Kirk through the transplant; but the DNA test performed by the hospital reveals that Kirk is not her father.

It is later revealed that Reddington was accused of committing treason by leaking information to the [[Soviet Union]] which led to the death of several American naval officers. Nicknamed \"the [[concierge]] of crime\", Reddington is known for brokering deals between criminals. He willingly surrenders to the FBI and provides information on a roster of criminals that he refers to as ''The Blacklist'': dangerous criminals who are so careful to avoid leaving any traces behind that the FBI has not even detected their existence. His ethics are somewhat murky, and he espouses the use of some crimes (such as extortion, counterfeiting, torture, and murder) in the service of \"the greater good\". He uses his arrangement with the FBI to pursue his own secret agenda; it was revealed that he needed their help to find [[#Milos Kirchoff, \"Berlin\"|Berlin]], a mysterious nemesis who had been attacking his organization.\n\nHe has an unexplained interest in Elizabeth Keen and knows personal secrets about her that she has never made public. He will stop at nothing to protect her and even went as far as to block her memories of the fire she was trapped in. But she finally regains them and learns that when her father attacked her mother, she killed him while still a child. Red explains that he never wanted Liz to end up like him and was trying to prevent that. He had a romantic affair with Liz's mother, Katarina Rostova, and it is implied several times that he may be Liz's biological father. No proof of this is ever shown, and Red himself initially denies it when directly confronted by Liz, although he does claim that he knew her father well. Red is confirmed as Liz's father in \"Dr. Adrian Shaw: Conclusion\", and in \"Mr. Kaplan: Conclusion\", he finally acknowledges this to Liz after she presents him with a DNA test confirming his paternity. In \"Monarch Douglas Bank\", it was revealed that Red used to be married to Naomi Hyland and has a daughter named Jennifer. In \"Dr. Linus Creel\", when he confronted Naomi about her, he discovers that Jennifer left her after her marriage to Frank and hasn't tried to make contact since then.\n\nAfter the death of [[#Alan Fitch, \"The Decembrist\"|Alan Fitch]], Reddington comes into conflict with the Director, the new head of the Cabal. The Director did not believe that Reddington had the Fulcrum, a blackmail file which Reddington had used as leverage to force a stalemate with the Cabal, and wanted to end the d\u00e9tente and kill Reddington. In response, Reddington urgently began seeking the Fulcrum, and managed to collect various items needed to decrypt it. Finally, after he confessed to Liz that he had initially hired [[#Tom Keen|Tom Keen]] to enter her life and watch over her, she gave him the Fulcrum, after which he was shot by the Director's agents. However, he survived. He continued to throw obstacles into Liz's path as she sought to find out more about her mother. When Liz was framed by the Cabal for the assassination of Senator Hawkins, Reddington countered by gathering 11 of the world's top investigative journalists and giving them the information contained in the Fulcrum. He later helped Liz go on the run after she assassinated [[United States Attorney General|Attorney General]] Tom Connolly, a member of the Cabal.\n\nAccompanied by Liz, Reddington goes on the run to gather various resources needed for his plan to bring down the Director and exonerate Liz. He eventually succeeds in forcing the Cabal to abandon the Director, and then kills him. However, Red is unable to clear Liz completely of the killing of Tom Connolly and she only returns to the taskforce as an asset like Red himself. He meets with Laurel Hitchin, who suggests he weakened the Cabal so that they would invite him to join it.\n\nAfter watching Liz die in his arms Dembe convinces Red to leave the van containing her body and Ressler places his FBI windbreaker around Red's shoulders and leads him over to the car with Dembe. As Ressler lets go of Red's arm and Red goes to get into the car he collapses and Dembe catches him saying: \"I got you.\" And proceeded to help Red into the car. After being told to stay away from Agnes by Tom in \"Cape May\", Red goes on a self-imposed exile to get away from everything and find better means to cope with Liz's death. He rescues a woman who attempted suicide one time and takes her back to the abandoned hotel. Only when a man talks to Red at the beach, that he realized the woman he rescued was a ghost and it was she who tells him that he did save her, through channeling his grief in losing Liz. In \"The Artax Network\", Red finally visits Dom, the father of Katarina, and while he still blames him for what he done, Dom reluctantly allows Red to stay. When Aram tracks him down to try and convince Red to help them again, he refuses to leave and sends Aram on his way. Dom later convinces Red to leave and honor his word to the FBI, saying that Red's got good people who count on him. As a token of gratitude, Red fixes a C\u266f key on Dom's piano and leaves. Red later visits Aram and tells him they have work to do.\n\nIn \"Dr. Adrian Shaw: Conclusion\", while Red is being held captive and threatened by Alexander Kirk, Red admits that he is in fact Elizabeth Keen's father. As Kirk goes to kill him, Red whispers something to Kirk that changes his mind and the two men disappear by the time the FBI arrive. Red later tells Liz that Kirk is \"gone\" but doesn't elaborate further and doesn't tell her that he's her father.\n\nIn \"Lipet's Seafood Company\" Red is berated by Cooper for letting Alexander Kirk go, but Red tells him that Kirk is gone and won't be coming back and moves on. Red works to meet with the President-Elect to whose campaign he contributed in exchange for his help with the Alexander Kirk situation and is eventually able to secure a [[Presidential pardon]] for Liz killing Tom Connolly. As a result, Liz is able to be reinstated as an FBI agent.\n\nIn \"The Apothecary\", Red is poisoned and needs the FBI to find Asa Hightower, the man who poisoned him. When confronting Marvin Gerard for not being at the dinner, he learns that Dembe has left him.\n\nIn \"Dembe Zuma\" Red finds out that Dembe left his side to find the traitor in his syndicate. Aram helps him out by procuring one name, Kathryn Nemec, whom Red recognizes as Mr. Kaplan. When confronting the man who housed her and shot Dembe, Red and Baz discovered he wired a bomb and escaped as he died in his house.\n\nIn \"Requiem\", Kaplan calls Red and he confronts her for hiding Liz from him. She tells him she needed to do what she should've done years ago in keeping Liz away from him and mentions that she has just begun her revenge. When Red tries to claim that she helped build his syndicate tight, Kaplan reminds him that she is the one who knows where the bodies of the people he had killed are buried and that she hid them from the FBI over the years, including that of Diane Fowler. This makes Red worried when Kaplan reveals that they can be used to not only attack his syndicate, but also destroy him from within.\n\nIn \"Mr. Kaplan\", many of Red's associates have broken rank and joined Kaplan in her plans for revenge. He also learns that Julian Gale, a rogue FBI agent, is working with her to procure the immunity deal between Red and the FBI. Red tries to appeal to Kaplan to end the war, but she refused, telling him that Liz needs to know the truth.\n\nIn \"Mr. Kaplan, Conclusion\", Red takes Ressler to Hitchin's cleaner, Henry Prescott, to help him find a barrel marked back two years ago. When they open it, Red tells Ressler that he had just found Reven Wright. With the evidence, he and Ressler appeal to Hitchin for help. When she tried to refuse, Red tells her that unless she wants to be held accountable for both the Task Force's downfall and the murder of Wright, she better uphold her end of the bargain and end the indictment on the Task Force. Red tries to appeal to Kaplan again at the bridge, promising he won't shoot her. He is shocked when she decided to jump to her own death. Later on, Red is confronted by Liz who tells him that she now knows he's her father. At Tansi Farms, Red and Dembe discover the suitcase buried there is gone and that they must get it back before Liz discovers the truth about how her mother, Katarina Rostova, died.\n\nIn \"Ian Garvey: Conclusion\", despite taking Garvey hostage and en route to collecting the skeletal remains of Katarina, Ian rams his sedan into another car, leaving Red and Dembe there as he escapes. Red later confronts Garvey after learning that the latter now knows that Liz is his daughter. Only then, Jennifer confronts Red for what he's done and the fact that Ian saved her and Naomi's life from their disappointment when they learned of his criminal career. Red then recognizes her from all the years. Despite Garvey shooting first, Red fires back and shoots him.\n\nIn \"Sutton Ross\", Red recovers the bag of bones and burns it in the presence of Dembe and Katarina's father Dom. However, unknown to Red, Liz was conspiring with Ross and Red's daughter Jennifer to learn the truth. Visited by a hallucination of Tom, Liz reveals what she has learned. The bones in the duffle bag may belong to the real Reddington and the man known as Reddington is possibly an imposter who murdered everyone who tried to reveal the truth to Liz.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://tvline.com/2018/05/16/the-blacklist-recap-season-5-finale-bones-identity-revealed|accessdate=May 24, 2018|date=May 16, 2018|title=The Blacklist Season 5 Finale Recap: Whose Bones Are in That Bag?}}</ref>\n\nIn \"Rassvet\", it is revealed that the real Raymond Reddington was killed by Liz as a child, an event she had remembered in \"Tom Connoly\" and thought was Alexander Kirk. The imposter's real name is revealed to be '''Ilya Koslov''' by Dominic Wilkinson. He is a childhood friend of Katarina Rostova, the love of his life and her occasional lover. Knowing that the Cabal would work to discredit Reddington and his evidence against them, Ilya took on his identity and became Raymond Reddington to prevent this and protect himself and Katarina. Dom tells Liz that Ilya underwent multiple [[plastic surgery|plastic surgeries]] over the course of a year to change his appearance to match Reddington's and information from Katarina to fill in the blanks. After learning the truth, Liz visits him in Hong Kong where Reddington points out that her search cost him his relationship with Dembe and refuses to answer why he continued his masquerade after gaining access to Reddington's money. He later confronts Dom and demands to know exactly what Dom had told Liz, word for word.\n\nIn \"Orion Relocation Services,\" he is revealed to not in fact be Ilya Koslov while Reddington's friend Frank Bloom is in fact the real Ilya. In \"Katarina Rostova,\" Katarina tells Liz that even she doesn't know who the imposter actually is and Dom lied to Liz about Reddington's true identity.\n\n=== Elizabeth Keen ===\n[[File:The Blacklist - Megan Boone (cropped).jpg|thumb|170px|Elizabeth Keen is portrayed by [[Megan Boone]], since 2013]]\nPortrayed by [[Megan Boone]]\n\n'''Elizabeth Scott Keen''' is an FBI profiler. According to Reddington and the FBI, her birth name is '''Masha Rostova''', and she was born in Moscow to Katarina Rostova, a Russian intelligence agent whom everyone regards as a \"myth\". Elizabeth has a mysterious and traumatic past: her wrist bears a large scar from a fire she was trapped in as a child, and her only memory of her biological father is of him rescuing her from the fire. Reddington admitted to blocking her memories of the fire. She eventually regains her memory of the event when she killed her father to protect her mother. Reddington had been trying to protect her from the knowledge when he blocked her memories.\n\nShe is the only person with whom Reddington is willing to work. She has yet to learn why, but he has told her that it has something to do with her missing father. While her adoptive father lay dying in the hospital, he insists to Red that Liz \"deserves to know\", but his death is hastened by Red to prevent Liz from \"knowing\". She develops a bond with Reddington as they continue to work together. The Director indicates there is a close personal connection between Liz and Red, but refuses to tell her what it is. Her once-idyllic marriage to Tom Keen unraveled as she discovered evidence that he was not the man he appeared to be. After she found out he was an agent hired by Berlin to keep her under surveillance, she had the marriage annulled. She kept Tom imprisoned on an abandoned ship for several months, interrogating him. Eventually, she was forced to let him go in exchange for Berlin's location after he murdered a harbormaster, Eugene Ames.\n\nLocal police investigated Ames' murder and had enough evidence to arrest Liz for her involvement; but she was saved by the intervention of Reddington, Cooper, then-assistant AG Connolly, and Tom himself. She also learned that she was the key to unlocking the mysteries of the Fulcrum, and that she had unknowingly had the Fulcrum itself in her possession since childhood. With the help of Leonard Caul, she deciphered the Fulcrum's contents and confronted the Director with them. She was then unknowingly infected with a customized biological weapon by the Cabal and tricked into infecting their target, Senator Hawkins. The Cabal then framed her for Hawkins's assassination and for being a Russian spy. After shooting Tom Connolly upon learning of his involvement with the faking of Cooper's cancer and the Cabal's sinister intentions for the other agents on the task force, Elizabeth is now a fugitive on the FBI's Most Wanted List. To evade capture by the FBI, she sought asylum at the Russian embassy, identifying herself as \"Masha Rostova\" and pretending to be a Russian spy.\n\nIn \"Marvin Gerard\", as Liz is being escorted to the airport, the convoy is attacked by Ressler and forcing Liz to run on foot. At a diner, she confronts Red for preventing her asylum until she learns he did this to save her life from being killed by the Cabal. While holding everyone in the diner hostage, Liz attacks an abusive boyfriend of one of the hostages' and nearly kills him until Red stops her. In \"Eli Matchett\", Liz comes to the realization that even if her name is cleared, it's impossible for her to go back to the life she once knew and must rely on Red to help her survive as a criminal. In \"Arioch Cain\", Liz and Red fake her death, after a bounty is put on Liz's head.\n\nIn \"Kings of the Highway\", Liz tracks down Reddington after he is kidnapped and ransoms him using a valuable object that Dembe claims is needed to clear her name. While Liz and Dembe are making the exchange for Reddington, the FBI arrives, and Ressler arrests Liz.\n\nIn \"The Director\", Liz is locked in the task force's cell as Ressler tries to protect her until she can testify. The Director and Laurel Hitchin attempt to prevent this by transferring Liz to an undisclosed location due to her supposedly having terrorist connections and then suffocating her when Aram changes the box's door code. Liz is nearly transferred, but the White House Counsel is able to prevent it and Ressler returns to transfer her to the courthouse. In \"The Director: Conclusion\", Liz spends the night in a cell protected by Ressler which keeps the Cabal from reaching her, but Laurel plots to have her assassinated as she's moved. Liz is later taken before a judge where she faces multiple charges that each come with a death sentence, including sixteen counts of murder. Laurel tries to have Liz assassinated, but is forced to call off her attempt by Red who captures the Director and threatens to turn him over to the World Court. With the help of Marvin Gerard, Red makes a deal with Laurel for her to publicly exonerate Liz on all but Tom Connolly's murder. In that case, Liz had to plead guilty to [[involuntary manslaughter]] and would get three years' probation. Though she would be free, Liz could never return to the FBI. Liz reluctantly took the deal in the end as Red ensured she'd remain part of the task force as an asset like him. Liz was publicly exonerated by Laurel while Karakurt was taken into custody and exposed as the man who had committed the terrorist acts Liz had been framed for. That night, Liz emerges from the courthouse a free woman and hugs Red who is waiting for her.\n\nLiz has difficulty adjusting to no longer being an FBI agent. After being beaten up by a man who thought she was a traitor, she is hospitalized and discovers she is pregnant. She accepts Tom's marriage proposal, hoping to start a family with him.\n\nLiz and Tom's wedding ceremony is interrupted by Mr. Solomon, who pursues them relentlessly. Liz is injured during the chase, forcing Reddington's doctor to perform an emergency C-section to save her baby. Liz dies due to complications with the C-section and the inability to reach a hospital on time: Matias Solomon blocks the vehicle containing Liz from continuing on to the hospital and Liz dies with Reddington holding her hand. Red is shown to be completely devastated by her death, as is the rest of the task force, and Tom is left to raise their daughter, Agnes, alone. In \"Cape May\" Red tells of a time he had to make a Hobson's choice: to save a child and lose her mother or lose both, saying it was the hardest choice he made by far in his life. While it initially seems he is referring to Liz' recent death, a later conversation reveals that the allusion was toward saving Liz (n\u00e9e Masha) as a child and losing her mother, Katarina.\n\nIn \"Alexander Kirk: Conclusion\", Liz is revealed to be alive, her death having been faked by Kaplan to protect her and Agnes. Liz is reunited with Tom and Agnes in [[Cuba]], but is captured by Alexander Kirk's men. Tied to a chair, Liz meets with Kirk who reveals he is in fact her father.\n\nIn \"Esteban\" Liz doesn't believe Kirk and demands to know what he's planning to do with her, Tom and Agnes. Kirk claims that her daughter will be fine and that he just needs to get rid of the rat. Kirk plans to take her back to the house she grew up in so she can see the truth for herself. In \"Mato\" Liz gets a clue from her past when she saw her mother, Katarina, putting a few toys and a ribbon bracelet in a coffee can used as a time machine. Liz digs the can up and discovers some truth in Kirk's words. When she is rescued by the FBI, Liz is reunited with Tom. In \"Miles McGrath\", Liz reads through her mother's journal and comes up to an important clue involving a rare cancer plaguing the males of the Rostov family. It was only then Red reveals the truth in Kirk's plans to use Liz for a blood transfusion as her blood contains vital blood cells needed to help him replenish his own and without her, he will keep Agnes hostage.\n\nIn \"The Lindquist Concerns\", Liz discovers a DNA test done by Kirk which claimed her to be his daughter and briefly mistrusted Red for it. In \"The Thrushes\", Liz helps Red talk Kirk out of committing suicide by begging him to give Agnes back to her. He does give her back to Liz that leads to his arrest.\n\nIn \"Dr. Adrian Shaw\", Kirk is taken to the hospital and believing she may be his only chance of rescuing him, goes through a DNA Test. If she is found to be a match, they will prepare her for surgery and do a blood transfusion. When Tom found out, he confronted Liz for the decision and admitted that he had met his mother, Susan, months earlier. Despite his warning not to get close to Kirk, Liz mentioned that she needs to help him as he may provide the answers to who she is. While being prepped for surgery, a doctor tells her that the DNA test results between her and Kirk came back and they're not a match. Believing Red had sent false transcripts of the DNA test, she calls him to confront him only to discover that Kirk had lied to her the whole time and the DNA transcript that Tom gave her was falsified. Angered by this, Liz confronts Kirk for lying to her and abandons him. In \"Dr. Adrian Shaw: Conclusion\", while Red is being held captive and threatened by Kirk, Red tells Kirk that he (Red) is Elizabeth Keen's father (\"What do you want me to say? Yes. Yes, Elizabeth is my daughter.\u201d).\n\nIn \"Lipet's Seafood Company\", Red is able to secure a [[Presidential pardon]] for Liz's killing of Connolly, allowing Cooper to reinstate her as an FBI agent.\n\nIn \"Dr. Bogdan Krilov\", Liz and Samar are sent to confront Dr. Krilov and discover Kaplan's plan to use Ressler to kill Hitchin as she is Red's only link to the Cabal under false pretenses. Liz discovers the truth about Kaplan being her former nanny whom she used to call as Katya and she begs Liz to end her relationship with Red before it's too late. Despite stopping Ressler from making a big mistake, Liz confronts Hitchin and tells her they will investigate in Reven Wright's disappearance. Inside the ice rink, Liz finally meets with Julian Gale who demands the FBI transcripts of their involvement with Red. She refuses to cooperate and suspects he has an ulterior motive in wanting the transcripts so he can capture Red.\n\nIn \"The Debt Collector\" Liz is kidnapped by Edgar Grant who was presumably hired by a man she had arrested previously that forced Red to cooperate with Kaplan. When he takes her to the cabin to meet with his client, Liz and Grant are taken by surprise when Red shows up. Despite Liz's attempts to help Red reconcile with Kaplan, a gun shot is fired by an unknown assailant. Liz later calls Red and informs him of her suspicion on Gale being his assailant.\n\nIn \"Mr. Kaplan Conclusion\", Liz is informed by Harold that he had done a DNA test between her and Red and she'll know within 24 hours if he is her father. She later tries to appeal to Kaplan to end the war with Red and she wants to show her a secret. On their way there, Red's men block the attempt and despite Kaplan's warning not to leave the car, Liz does. After opening an envelope containing the DNA test and believing it to be Kaplan's secret, Liz confronts Red for not telling her the truth about him being her father and having to find out from Cooper. She tells him that she was upset that she had already lost her mother, her nanny and Sam the people who knew her the best. Despite this, Liz mentions that she can't let Red deny the fact that she's just like him and anger, despair and love is part of a normal family. Liz also comes to the realization that Red wanted her to grow more as a FBI profiler and embraces him.\n\nIn \"Zarak Mosadek\", while staking out at a pub in Baltimore with Aram, Liz discovers a woman named Lillian who works as a bartender meeting with Garvey. Later on after taking her to the apartment where she lives, Liz is surprised when she learns Lillian was put in Witness Protection Program by Garvey because of Red's past abuse with her and her mother, Naomi. She mentions that she is also Red's daughter and they're half-sisters.\n\nIn \"Sutton Ross\", Liz visits Tom's gravesite and she tells Tom's ghost that she now knows that her father, Raymond Reddington, is dead and that the man is an imposter. Tom warns Liz to be careful due to how resourceful the imposter is.\n\nIn \"Rassvet,\" Liz tracks down her grandfather Dominic Wilkinson with the help of Ressler and finally learns much of the truth about Reddington and her mother from him. Liz learns that the man she shot as a child, as remembered in \"Tom Connolly,\" was in fact the real Reddington and she killed him. Dom tells Liz about her mother and her history with Ilya Koslov, the man who became Reddington to protect Katarina. Dom states that twenty-eight years before, her mother had promised to send him a letter to a post office box when she was safe, but he has never gotten one despite checking every week. Liz later flies to Hong Kong and reveals to Reddington that she knows the truth about who he really is, but he refuses to answer her questions about why he continued being Reddington after gaining access to all of his money.\n\n=== Donald Ressler ===\n[[File:The Blacklist - Diego Klattenhoff (cropped).jpg|thumb|170px|Donald Ressler is portrayed by [[Diego Klattenhoff]], since 2013]]\nPortrayed by [[Diego Klattenhoff]]\n\n'''Donald Ressler''' is a senior FBI agent who is a stickler for procedure. His father was an honest policeman who was betrayed and killed by his corrupt partner after refusing to take bribes. He spent five years on an FBI task force obsessively pursuing Reddington, which resulted in his fianc\u00e9e's breaking off their engagement. He despises having to work with a criminal like Reddington, but he acknowledges that Reddington does get results. Initially he distrusts Liz Keen and her connection to Reddington, but eventually comes to respect and work well with her. After he was shot by Anslo Garrick, he reignited his relationship with his former fianc\u00e9e, Audrey Bidwell. However, in \"Mako Tanida\" she was believed to be killed by Mako Tanida and forcing Ressler to side with Red to find him. After capturing him, Ressler and his friend, Bobby Jonica takes him to his father's secret cabin. On the drive there, Ressler is betrayed when Tanida informs him that he wasn't responsible for the deaths of both the FBI agents and Audrey's. He also learns that Jonica assumed Akio's(Tanida's deceased brother) identity to continue his business, leading the latter to shoot Tanida for exposing him and Ressler slamming the brakes to stop him. After capturing Jonica, Ressler blamed him for his betrayal that led to the deaths of their closest friends and Audrey. He also admits that while he doesn't like working with Red, he was the reason why Ressler had Audrey back in his life and because of Jonica, she's dead. Ressler gave him a choice to kill himself with a knife or Jonica will be shot. Liz convinces Ressler to stand down as Jonica kills himself with the knife. Back at his apartment, Ressler is heartbroken when he discovers a pregnancy test and learns that Audrey was pregnant with his child. He later developed an addiction to pain medication from what he went through with Audrey's death and later Meera's own. He managed to overcome it when Liz convinces Ressler to seek help.\n\nIn \"Tom Connolly\", with Cooper removed from being the FBI Director of Counterterrorism and finally being aware of the Cabal, Wright names Ressler as acting director. When Liz goes on the run after killing Tom Connolly, Ressler urges her to come in, saying that otherwise he will have to lead the FBI manhunt against her.\n\nIn \"The Troll Farmer\", Ressler interrogates Cooper for his involvement in letting Liz escape and learns a little bit of the Cabal's plans for the FBI itself. He eventually decides to release Cooper, but warns that they will keep an eye on him. In \"Marvin Gerard\", Red informs Ressler that the Cabal had set a trap up for Liz at the airport and he rushes in to prevent the departure. Though he succeeds, Liz is shaken up by his reckless actions, believing he wanted to capture her, and flees the scene before Ressler could explain himself. He is later visited by Tom Keen, wishing to assist him knowing trouble is on the horizon for both Red and Liz. In \"Eli Matchett\", Ressler refuses his help and warns Tom to stay out of his way.\n\nAfter arresting Liz, Ressler joins Red's efforts to protect her from the Cabal, aiding in protecting Karakurt in \"the Director\". He later tells Liz that he believes she was framed and he would not have arrested her if he believed he couldn't protect her. Ressler is able to protect Liz until Red forces the Cabal to exonerate her. He then returns control of the task force to the reinstated Cooper.\n\nIn the season 4 episode \"Philomena\", Ressler's old friend Julian Gale invites Ressler to join his investigation into the eighty-six bodies exhumed by Mr. Kaplan. Cooper suggests Ressler do so to help the task force stay ahead of Gale's investigation.\n\nIn \"Dr. Bogdan Krilov\", Ressler follows an anonymous tip on Reven Wright's disappearance that leads to a woman living with her sister who has claimed she saw Hitchin order some men carrying a rolled carpet. When he delved further, the woman admitted she saw a foot come out of the carpet, leading Reesler to suspect that Hitchin murdered Wright. Before he could take the woman into protective custody, Ressler and her are attacked by men presumably working for Hitchin. However, Liz and Samar suspect he was being manipulated by Kaplan after Krilov confesses. They stop Ressler just in time from killing Hitchin and Liz revealing he was under the influence of [[propofol]] and manipulated to kill Hitchin by Kaplan and Krilov. Despite standing down, Ressler is later taken into custody with his FBI badge revoked.\n\nIn \"The Debt Collector\", when he is accused by Gale for wanting to help Red, Ressler reprimands him for being selfish. He points out to Gale that he was on another assignment by looking into Wright's murder and had no time to deal with Red's shenanigans. Ressler lost his badge upon being under the influence of propofol and nearly killed Hitchin had Liz and Samar not stopped him. The last thing he needed is Gale causing him more problems with his life. He later apologizes to Ressler upon learning what happened to him.\n\nIn \"Mr. Kaplan\", Ressler informs Cooper, Liz, and Samar that Gale has gotten enough intel to demand an indictment on the Task Force involving Red, from the grand jury.\n\nIn \"Mr. Kaplan, Conclusion\", Red helps Ressler locate Henry Prescott and later finds the murdered Reven Wright. At the end and inside her home, Ressler didn't agree to Hitchin's demands and pushed her towards a chair, killing her. He later calls Prescott to help hide Hitchin's body in a similar manner to Wright's, under the pseudonym Red gave Ressler, Frank Sturgeon.\n\nIn \"Smokey Putnum\", Ressler is informed by Cooper that Hitchin died by hitting her head and there will be no further investigation. He seems relieved by this until Prescott visit him in his van. He informs Ressler that he knows the truth and blackmails him for favors if he wants Prescott to keep his secret involving his accidental murdering of Hitchin.\n\nIn \"Miss Rebecca Thrall\", Ressler is contacted by Prescott for a favor involving a package inside of a car to be delivered to him. He is reminded of their deal in what could happen if he refuses. After delivering the car to Prescott, Ressler warns him to never call him again.\n\nIn \"The Informant\", while pursuing a criminal, Ressler is contacted by Prescott to stop pursuing his clients. While searching Judge Sonia Fisher's apartment, Ressler asks Samar to search the bedroom. After she leaves, he comes across a tablet and uses the password on it. It's there, Ressler discovers the names of Prescott's clients, including his own name on the list. He gets a call from Red, telling him it is time they had a chat. With Red's help, Ressler discovered Prescott's real name and meets him in the park where he's playing football with his family and arrests him. Afterwards, he gives Cooper a letter of resignation and includes his confession for all the things he's done. Cooper rejects the letter, stating that his name wasn't found on Prescott's client list. Prescott is later killed by Reddington.\n\n=== Tom Keen ===\n[[File:Ryan Eggold.jpg|thumb|170px|Tom Keen is portrayed by [[Ryan Eggold]], since 2013]]\nPortrayed by [[Ryan Eggold]]\n\n'''Thomas Vincent Keen''', born '''Christopher Hargrave''' (Blacklister No. 7), originally from Couva, is Elizabeth's husband, an elementary school teacher who turns out to be a covert operative working for [[#Milos Kirchoff, \"Berlin\"|Berlin]]. When first confronted by Elizabeth, Tom asserts to her that he was assigned to protect her, and that Reddington \"is not who [she] think he is\". Elizabeth shoots him and stages his death, but keeps him prisoner on a boat for several months to extract as much information as possible. When she is nearly discovered by the harbor master, Tom saves her by strangling him to death; as a token of gratitude, she lets Tom escape. Tom later meets with Reddington and their conversation reveals a previous working relationship. Apparently, Tom was recruited at the age of 14 (he was then known as Jacob Phelps) by a blacklister known as The Major ([[Lance Henriksen]]) due to the combination of sociopathy and extreme talent, to be groomed for covert operations. Reddington acquired him from The Major to insert him into Elizabeth's life, but when Berlin found out, he doubled Reddington's price. After his escape, Tom utilizes The Major for a new covert operation as a [[neo-Nazi]] drug and arms dealer in [[Dresden]] named Christof Mannheim, but not before calling Elizabeth; he appears to have developed genuine feelings for her during their \"marriage\", which seems to complicate matters for both The Major and Reddington, as it was the reason behind his killing the harbor master on Elizabeth's boat. When Elizabeth nearly gets subpoenaed for the harbor master's murder, Reddington and Ressler attempt to extradite Tom from Germany so he can clear her name; Tom initially refuses, but then appears in court and willfully surrenders. With the help of Assistant Attorney General, \"Smiling Tommy\" Connolly, Reddington helps Tom and Elizabeth sweep the whole event under the rug; Elizabeth is cleared while Tom \"never existed\". The Major, seeing Tom as a liability after this affair, tries to shoot Tom but the Germans intercept them; Tom bargains for their lives and they both manage to escape, but The Major is still set to have Tom killed. Desperate, Tom hides at Elizabeth's place and pleads her to give him his passports; in exchange, she convinces him to tell her the truth about his relationship with Reddington, then reveals that she had always known that on some level, Tom's love for her and their life together was genuine. He later tells Liz of his dream to become a fisherman and urges her to come with him to Japan to start a new life with each other, but she declines, telling him that she needs to finish what she's started. After Liz kills Tom Connolly and becomes one of the FBI's most wanted, Tom departs on his boat to Japan to begin his new life.\n\nIn \"Marvin Gerard\", Tom appears before Ressler, wishing to help assist him in saving Liz, suspecting the tides are against Red's favor. In \"Eli Matchett\", he and Ressler get into a brief scuffle with each other. While waiting for Liz to call him, Tom meets with Cooper and is recruited to help investigate Karakurt. Posing as a hustler, he befriends a wealthy socialite and infiltrates an underground street-fighting ring, where he eventually locates Karakurt. He brings the assassin to Cooper, but the Cabal finds them, forcing all three men to go on the run. Eventually, with Ressler and Cooper's help, he evades the Cabal and delivers Karakurt into federal custody. After Liz is released, Tom proposes marriage to her, but she turns him down, saying that she is too uncertain about the future to accept. Tom is later confronted by Red who warns him to stay away from Liz, after the actions he pulled when he ignored his first warning that led to this. After Liz's death, he tells Red to stay away from Agnes and blames him for his failure to protect her.\n\nIn \"The Artax Network\", Samar visits Tom in the hospital who has been having a hard time raising Agnes alone and offers to help him. Tom is later recruited again by Cooper to keep an eye on Cynthia Panabaker and he discovers more that confirms Cooper's suspicion. Visiting Cooper in the post office, he is able to confirm the woman that Panabaker had a meeting looks like Liz's mother, Katarina.\n\nIn \"Alexander Kirk\", Tom is forced to work with Mattais Solomon and Susan Hargrave, the people responsible for Liz's death to get at Alexander Kirk, the man who ordered the attack. During the mission, Tom shoots Solomon in revenge, but Solomon seemingly gets away after Tom leaves. Tom later goes after Susan before Red calls him to stop Tom. Red reveals that Tom is in fact Christopher Hargrave, Susan's long-missing son. Moments later, Susan enters and tells him about her son, how he disappeared twenty-eight years earlier when he was three years old and she always hopes to see him again. On Red's advice, Tom doesn't let Susan know he's her son but doesn't kill her for Agnes' sake.\n\nIn \"The Lindquist Concern\" Tom suspects Kirk is manipulating Liz and seeks out Ressler's help for previous files from the FBI. Though still unable to trust him, Ressler agreed to help Tom out by giving him previous FBI files. Tom's spying on one of Kirk's men and confrontation leads him to where Kirk's true whereabouts are: Russia. He calls Liz to warn Red about Kirk's plans to kill him.\n\nIn \"The Architect\", Tom searches for the truth about his true parentage and why he disappeared years ago, after reading the death of his father, Howard Hargrave. His search leads to a mother whose son made Tom disappear and procures a confession from him.\n\nIn \"Whitehall/Whitehall Conclusion ([[The Blacklist: Redemption]])\", Tom discovers his father, Howard, is alive and being held in a mental hospital. He also learns that Susan had faked Howard's death and had an ulterior motive for Halycon. This led to Tom convincing Nez to side with him as they try to uncover the truth of the secret Susan had been hiding the whole time concerning Whitehall. Solomon tries to stop Tom and Nez, claiming that Susan was set up by Howard and had no knowledge on it.\n\nIn \"Mr. Kaplan, Conclusion\", it's revealed that Tom found the suitcase Kaplan left in the storage locker and looks inside it. He discovers the skeletal remains of an undisclosed person and closes the suitcase. Tom then takes it with him under Kaplan's orders to deliver the suitcase.\n\nIn \"Ian Garvey\", Tom finally found out who the skeletal remains belong to and the connection she has with Elizabeth. Now realizing the truth, he calls Liz to come home and plans to tell her the truth about her mother along with the fact Red killed Kopal. However, Ian Garvey interferes with his group and attacks the two. Having taken back the bag containing the skeletal remains, he leaves and has a few of his men get rid of Tom and Liz to send a message to Red. Despite Tom's best efforts to fight them off, he is stabbed as Liz loses consciousness. Tom's final words are that Liz will be the one to make it and he dies in the hospital.\n\n=== Meera Malik ===\n[[File:Parminder Nagra by Gage Skidmore 2.jpg|thumb|170px|Meera Malik is portrayed by [[Parminder Nagra]]]]\nPortrayed by [[Parminder Nagra]]\n\n'''Meera Malik''' is a [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]] [[field agent]] assigned to Reddington's security detail at the personal request of Diane Fowler.

He is on an upwardly mobile career path in the Bureau, something that his work with Reddington occasionally threatens to derail. He had a particular interest in Reddington's past, and is willing to oblige Reddington's unusual requests due to this understanding of him. He was attacked and put into a coma by Berlin's agents at the end of season 1.\n\nBy Season 2, Cooper regained consciousness, but is revealed to have an inoperable brain tumor in the episode \"T. Earl King VI\". With the help of his friend, Attorney General Connolly, he entered an experimental drug trial. However, he has had to compromise his ethics and perform various morally dubious tasks for Connolly to stay in his favor and remain in the trial. He confronts Connolly, who admits that he has been manipulating him on behalf of the Cabal. He blackmails Cooper into helping them, saying that they will destroy Cooper and his wife Charlene if he fails to cooperate. Cooper tells Reddington about the situation, and the two attempt to use Cooper's connection to Connolly against the Cabal. When Liz is framed for the assassination of Senator Hawkins, Cooper flatly refuses to cooperate with the Cabal and is placed on administrative leave by Connolly. After Liz finds evidence that Cooper's doctor is working for the Cabal, Cooper confronts the man and discovers that the Cabal faked his cancer and that he is not dying. After he witnesses Liz's murder of Connolly, he tells her to run, and later turns over his badge. Ressler interrogates him to determine his complicity in Connolly's murder, but eventually decides to release him.\n\nIn \"Marvin Gerard\", Cooper is told by Wright that for him to have the charges dropped against him, Cooper not only has to resign, but also take a desk job. Although he reluctantly does, Cooper is determined to help Liz clear her name and investigates Karakurt.

Charlene suggests they hide at their neighbor's cabin, admitting that she had cheated on Cooper with him.\n\nIn \"The Director Conclusion\", after Red forces the Cabal to exonerate Liz, a mission Copper aids in, Cooper is reinstated as head of the task force and congratulates Ressler for his work in Cooper's absence. Later, he separates from Charlene.\n\nIn \"Mr. Kaplan: Conclusion\", after facing the prospect of the task force being shut down due to Kaplan's war on Reddington, Cooper resolves to settle once and for all the question of Liz and Reddington's relationship. He takes a sample of Reddington's blood from an evidence locker for an old case, and has it tested against Liz's DNA.\n\nIn \"Kuwait\", it is revealed that as a young soldier during the Gulf War, Cooper covered up an illicit smuggling operation run by his superiors. His friend, Daniel Hutton, discovered Cooper's involvement and the two argued when Hutton threatened to blow the whistle on the operation. Iraqi soldiers attacked the pair and kidnapped Hutton. Cooper's commander later recommended him for the Navy Cross in exchange for his silence regarding the smuggling. In the present day, Hutton turns up alive and Cooper travels to Iran to rescue him. While attempting to return to the US, Cooper is captured by Hutton's men. Hutton reveals he escaped captivity years ago and became \"the Simoom\", an infamous terrorist who sold classified information to criminals.

The Director cuts off Liz's air to force Aram to give up the password. Aram then confronts the Director at gunpoint in a desperate attempt to stop him from taking Liz. She persuades Aram to stand down, but in the process he buys enough time for Cynthia Panabaker, the White House counsel, to arrive and transfer Liz to a federal courthouse under Ressler's direct supervision. Aram later joins Red's team to kidnap the Director and exonerate Liz by using his computer skills to hack an elevator's controls to make it go to the wrong floor.

However, Samar soon discovers that her brother is not who she believes him to be, and is in fact the very terrorist she had spent years hunting. She helps her former partner Levi destroy important documents, but she is captured by her brother and taken to the harbor, where Reddington intercepts them, freeing Samar and capturing Shahin. Reddington asks Samar to let him take Shahin for his own purposes, and she sadly agrees, saying her brother died long ago. Afterwards, Samar and Ressler become intimate.\n \nSamar secretly helps Liz locate Reddington after he is kidnapped.

He visits Peter Kotsiopulos' office as a representative of the Cabal, reprimanding the Director for his inability to prevent Reddington from releasing the Fulcrum and threatening that continued failure would mean his life. He viciously tortures Dembe for information on Reddington's location, but fails to break him. Through a deception involving Mr. Vargas, Solomon finally tricks Dembe into revealing the information and captures Reddington and Liz. However, Dembe rescues them and drives Solomon off. In \"Sir Crispin Crandall\", while trying to fire at Red and Liz, he finds himself trapped with all of the most intelligent people in cryogenics.

However, Cooper knocks him out from behind, and Ressler arrests him.\n\nWhile being transported by federal agents, Solomon is rescued by an unknown person driving a Rolls Royce. Then, working for Susan Hargrave, he plots to steal a nuclear weapon. This plot turns out to be a decoy to divert the FBI's attention from his real mission: capturing Liz Keen.

However, Reddington, Tom, and the task force members are able to fend off Solomon's men long enough for Ressler to come to the rescue, allowing Liz and Tom to escape. He chases Liz again after her escape and hunts her ambulance as Red tries to take her to the hospital to save her life. Solomon is able to disable Red's vehicle and pins him and his men down. Eventually FBI backup arrives and Solomon flees as his men are killed. However, the delay in getting to the hospital caused by Solomon's attack causes Liz to apparently die due to complications during childbirth.\n\nIn \"Alexander Kirk\", Solomon and Tom are forced to work together in an operation to take down Blacklister Alexander Kirk who had orchestrated the attack on Liz. During the mission, Tom and Solomon rob a pharmacy together and Tom shoots Solomon in the gut in revenge for the attempt on Liz's life.

Names on the list are criminals that the FBI does not have overwhelming evidence against, hence why they have never been caught. Some criminals are unknown to the FBI, or have avoided leaving behind the needed evidence for conviction, or live a high-profile public life whilst concealing their criminal behaviour.\n\nThe list is truly international with at least several members from [[Serbia]], China, Russia, (Germany), United Kingdom, Japan, [[Iran]], [[Uzbekistan]], etc., in addition to those from the United States.\n\nIt is unknown how many members the list contains, but the highest number revealed on the list so far is 192 in the comic book series and 184 in the TV series.\n\nIt is unknown what criteria Red is using to determine each member's position on the Blacklist, but most of the lowest numbers revealed so far (e. g. Katarina Rostova, No. 3, Mr. Kaplan, No. 4, Tom Keen, No. 7, Berlin, No. 8, Dembe Zuma, No. 10) have been the subject of multi-episode story arcs, suggesting that lower numbers are more significant figures in the show's mythology. The identities of many of the lowest numbers on the Blacklist remain unrevealed to date.\n\nVarious Blacklisters are also (or used to be) members of the Cabal.\n\n{| <!-- class=\"wikitable sortable\" --> class=\"wikitable collapsible collapsed\" <!-- class=\"wikitable nowraplinks\" --> style=\"width:99%;\"\n|-\n! style=\"background:#CFC; color:black;\" colspan=\"8\"| {{center|Raymond Reddington's Blacklist}}\n|-\n! style=\"width:1%;\"|No.\n!! style=\"width:4%;\"|Blacklister(s)\n!! style=\"width:1%;\"|Origin\n!! style=\"width:7%;\"|Career\n!! style=\"width:1%;\"|Status\n!! style=\"width:3%;\"|Actor(s)\n!! style=\"width:5%;\"|Appearance\n|-\n<!-- | 1\n| [[#The Cabal|The Cabal]]\n| [[File:Flag of None.svg|26px]]\n| \n* Clandestine organization\n* Main enemy of Raymond Reddington\n* \n| Active\n| style=\"background:#ececec; color:gray; vertical-align:middle; text-align:center;\" class=\"table-na\"|\n| Entire series\n|-\n|2||?||||||||\n|- -->\n|3\n| [[#Katarina Rostova|Katarina Rostova]]\n| {{flagicon|Russia}}\n|\n* Former Russian spy\n* Biological mother of Elizabeth Keen\n| Active\n| [[Lotte Verbeek]] young Katarina Rostova\n[[Laila Robins]] present day\n|\n* \"Cape May\" (flashback)\n* \"Mato\" (flashback)\n* \"Miles McGrath\" (flashback)\n* \"Requiem\" (flashback)\n* \"Rassvet\" (flashback)\n* \"Robert Diaz\"\n* [[The Blacklist (season 7)|Season 7]] (recurring)\n|-\n|4\n| [[#Mr. Kaplan|Kathryn Nemec<br><small>Mr. Kaplan</small>]]\n| {{flagicon|United States}}\n|\n*Raymond Reddington's cleaner\n*Former nanny to Liz\n|Deceased\n|[[Susan Blommaert]] present day\n[[Joanna P.

All of these criminals are dead, captured or active, and most appeared on more than one episode. -->\n\n=== Pavlovich brothers ===\nPortrayed by Goran Ivanovski, Renne Gjoni, [[James Biberi]] and [[Stivi Paskoski]] <!-- (season 1, episodes 1 and 19) -->\n\nThe '''Pavlovich brothers''' (Blacklisters No. 119\u2013122) were four Serbian relatives who specialized in snatch and grab operations. They first got a taste for blood working for Milo\u0161evi\u0107's protective detail during the ethnic cleansing campaigns of the Yugoslav Wars, but went on to operate independently with no political affiliation. Working together as a team, they used high firepower and ruthless tactics to achieve their goals.\n\nIn the series' pilot, they kidnapped Beth Ryker, the daughter of General Daniel Ryker, by killing six FBI Agents during the ambush.\n\nThey then kidnapped a Chinese scientist who had been rescued by the CIA. Later, Raymond Reddington hired them to kidnap Tom Keen. They delivered Tom to Elizabeth Keen. While attempting to smuggle Xiaoping Li back to China, they were killed at McKendrick Pier.\n\n=== Stanley Kornish, \"The Stewmaker\" ===\n[[File:10.17.09TomNoonanByLuigiNovi.jpg|thumb|170px|Stanley Kornish is portrayed by [[Tom Noonan]], in 2013 and 2013]]\nPortrayed by [[Tom Noonan]] (season 1, episode 4; season 2, episode 8)\n\n'''Stanley R. Kornish''' (Blacklister No. 161), a dentist by trade, had a separate career as a professional body disposal expert. Working for whoever could afford his services, he used his expert knowledge of chemicals to dissolve corpses until there was almost nothing left. He kept a photo of and a tooth from each victim as a souvenir. His dog accompanied him on his disposals.\n\nIn \"[[The Decembrist]]\", Raymond Reddington tells Milos Kirchoff how he interrogated Kornish about a photograph of Zoe D'Antonio found on the body of one of his associates. He explains that Zoe was brought to Kornish, for him to make her disappear.\n\n===Gina Zanetakos===\n[[File:MargaritaLevievaJun09.jpg|thumb|170px|Gina Zanetakos is portrayed by [[Margarita Levieva]], in 2013 and since 2016]]\nPortrayed by [[Margarita Levieva]]\n\n'''Gina Zanetakos''' (Blacklister No. 152) was a corporate terrorist who committed terrorist acts that resulted in corporations losing or gaining an advantage over the competition. Raymond Reddington said she once contacted him for help in assassinating a Supreme Court judge. He also claimed that she was a former lover of Tom Keen. She worked for the Major.\n\nUsing the alias Shubie Hartwell, she entered the United States. She was hired by the Hanar Group to detonate a dirty bomb in the Port of Houston. The explosion would have allowed the Hanar investors to profit from the re-routing of sea shipping to New Orleans. After being captured, she was allowed a plea bargain since the bomb had not devastated the port. A search of her apartment produced a photograph of Tom Keen who she claims not to know. When questioned about the murder of Victor Fokin, she claims to have committed the crime on the orders of Raymond Reddington.\n\nGina is eventually released from prison. Tom contacts her, looking for work to provide for Liz and his unborn baby. Gina reluctantly brings him in to work on a jewelry heist. After they pull off the heist, she asks him to run away with her, and he refuses. She then double-crosses him and has him shot, but he survives. He then confronts her at gunpoint and demands that she persuade the Major to let him walk away from their organization, and she agrees. Later she is seen on the phone with an unknown person, talking about Tom.\n\nGina and the Major ambush Tom in Liz's apartment. The Major is about to kill Tom when Gina decides to kill the Major instead and leaves Tom to bury the body.\n\n=== Anslo Garrick ===\nPortrayed by [[Ritchie Coster]] <!-- (season 1, episodes 9 and 10) -->\n\n'''Anslo Garrick''' (Blacklister No. 16) was a mercenary who specialized in raiding secret and well defended prison facilities and extracting high-level prisoners, always using extreme levels of violence. He worked almost exclusively with a unit of highly armed, countryless mercenaries known as \"the Wild Bunch\". At some point, he raided a CIA blacksite in the Bering Sea to exfiltrate a man named Mahmoud al-Azok. His employer paid him to plant evidence that blamed the raid on Peruvian insurgent organization Shining Path (Sendero Luminoso, Communist Party of Peru, Partido Comunista del Per\u00fa). At some point he and Raymond Reddington worked together, though the alliance ended in 2008 when Garrick gave the FBI his train number and itenerary for a stop at Waterloo station in Brussels. Once Red arrived, a hit squad led by Donald Ressler made an attempt on his life, but failed. Red realized that Garrick had betrayed him and shot him in the face, damaging the right side of his face and apparently blinding his right eye. However, Garrick survived and spent 5 years in a prison described as a \"black hole\". To remind himself of the incident, Garrick never had the facial scarring repaired by surgery.\n\nHe was hired by Alan Fitch to kidnap Reddington. He succeeded in extracting Reddington from the FBI's custody, and tortured him. Reddington ultimately killed him by stabbing him in the neck in \"Anslo Garrick Conclusion\".\n\n=== Madeline Pratt ===\n[[File:Jennifer Ehle (30443863926).jpg|thumb|170px|Madeline Pratt is portrayed by [[Jennifer Ehle]]]]\nPortrayed by [[Jennifer Ehle]] <!-- (season 1, episode 14; season 2, episode 14) -->\n\n'''Madeline Pratt''' (Blacklister No. 73), outwardly, is a well-known and politically active socialite. Behind the facade, she forms relationships and affiliations with powerful, influential people and then uses those connections to commit million dollar heists. Reddington credits her with the theft of 6 million dollars' worth of diamonds from a De Beers outpost in Congo and a heist on a mint in Prague in which the security fibers used to print the Czech koruna were stolen and then used to print counterfeit banknotes. She had a previous romantic connection with Reddington, which he broke off.\n\nIn the first season, she poses as Red's widow to steal documents belonging to him worth 10&nbsp;million dollars from a bank in Istanbul to gain his attention regarding the proposed theft of the Effigy of Atargatis (leaving the first note). She met with Elizabeth Keen, whom Red had said was a career thief. After using Red and Liz as a diversion to allow her to steal the Effigy of Atargatis, she sold it to the Russian mafia after removing the Kungar 6 list. Red tricked her into revealing the location of the nuclear warheads and allowed her to escape. Later she stole a painting from Red as revenge (leaving the second note).\n\nIn the second-season episode \"T. Earl King VI\", Pratt was \"kidnapped\" by the Kings to bait Red into infiltrating \"The Palace\" so he could be sold at their auction.\n\n=== Milos Kirchoff, \"Berlin\" ===\n[[File:Peter Stormare.jpg|thumb|170px|Milos Kirchoff is portrayed by [[Peter Stormare]], in 2014]]\nPortrayed by [[Peter Stormare]] <!-- (seasons 1 and 2) -->\n\n'''Milos Kirchoff''' (Blacklister No. 8) is one of Reddington's nemeses between the first and second seasons.\n\nPrior to the series, Kirchoff started out in the [[Red Army]], rose to the rank of Colonel and later became a member of the [[KGB]]. Notorious for sending his enemies to the gulags in Siberia, he was a loyal servant of the [[Soviet Union]]. In 1991, near the end of the [[Cold War]], Kirchoff took part in a meeting in [[Kursk]] with other Soviet officials on how to combat their more progressive countrymen who wanted the Soviet Union dissolved. The meeting was interrupted when a bomb went off, killing 15 attendants and the last of the old Soviet resistance. The act was done by a man named Kiryl Morozov on the orders of Alan Fitch, known as \"The Decembrist\", but Reddington was blamed. Shortly after that, Kirchoff's daughter was suspected of falling in love with a dissident and imprisoned. He used his connections to help her escape, but the Kremlin found out and decided to use him as an example to the Motherland.\n\nHe was put in a Siberian gulag where a lot of people he had put away were imprisoned. One day, he was sent a pocket watch he had given his daughter. Over several months, he was sent several body parts and was led to believe that they were hers and that Reddington was behind it. In reality, Fitch sent body parts belonging to someone else and helped Kirchoff's daughter escape to the United States, but not before convincing her that her father was responsible for the bombing. Eventually, Kirchoff sharpened one of the bones he had been sent into a weapon, killed the people holding him captive and escaped and formed his criminal syndicate under the alias \"Berlin\".\n\nDuring the first eight episodes of the [[The Blacklist (season 2)|second season]], Red meets with Milos Kirchoff again, who once more blames him for his daughter's death and intends to hurt Red by going after Zoe, whom he assumes is Red's daughter. Red reveals that Milos Kirchoff's daughter Zoe is actually alive and someone else in Milos Kirchoff's faction had lied to him about her being killed. He is soon reunited with his daughter, who had been living under an assumed name as Zoe D'Antonio.\n\nIn the episode \"[[The Decembrist]]\", after being reunited with Zoe, Milos learned the truth of Red's innocence. He kills Kiryl Morozov after learning of Fitch's orders to frame Red and use Milos as a pawn. He was furious with Alan Fitch for lying to him about her death and takes action. Milos orders his agents to abduct Fitch and strap a pipe bomb on him, intending to kill him. Using Zoe to gain the access numbers to free Fitch, Red holds Milos at gunpoint. Red returns to the warehouse where he is holding Milos prisoner with a bottle of vodka and places 2 shot glasses in front of Milos. After they reminisce about the Cold War and finish the bottle, Red kills Milos.\n\n=== Luther Braxton ===\n[[File:Ron Perlman by Gage Skidmore 3.jpg|thumb|170px|Luther Braxton is portrayed by [[Ron Perlman]], in 2015]]\nPortrayed by [[Ron Perlman]] <!-- (season 2, episodes 9 and 10) -->\n\n'''Luther Todd Braxton''' (Blacklister No. 21) is a professional thief known for stealing money and information from China, Iran, and the United States.

After they threatened him to kill Elizabeth if he didn't talk his motives for his infiltration, Tom and makes a deal: in exchange for Liz would not be their target, he reveals his assignment: he's going to help them solve the murder of a woman named Sarah Hastings, who was affiliated to the Germans, which is the main reason they want revenge for her death.

While Gerard was being considered for a seat on the federal bench, his teenage son, Timothy, fell in with a bad crowd and, suffering emotional abuse from his mother, abused prescription drugs he got from her supply. Gerard separated from his wife and filed for custody, but since his wife came from an influential family, he wasn't able to. He eventually went so far as to kidnap Timothy to keep him away from his mother, for which he was disbarred and sentenced to 7\u201310 years at Federal Correctional Institution, Cumberland. Timothy hung himself a year later. Gerard continued doing legal work behind bars, serving as shadow counsel to politicians, CEOs, and high-profile criminals, including Reddington, who apparently consulted with Gerard before he turned himself in to the FBI against Gerard's strong objections.\n\nIn \"Sir Crispin Crandall\", Gerard locates the vault where Peter Kotsiopulos is keeping his embezzled money.\n\nIn \"The Director, Conclusion\", when Red puts together a team to exonerate Liz, he calls in Gerard as part of that team. Gerard helps them plan on how to kidnap Peter Kotsiopulos. Once they have the Director, Red demands Laurel Hitchin exonerate Liz in exchange for Red not taking the Director to the Hague and sends in Gerard to discuss the terms of the deal with Laurel. Eventually Gerard manages to negotiate a deal where Liz is exonerated publicly for all but the Tom Connolly murder as Liz killed him in front of witnesses and it wasn't in self-defense. Instead, Laurel offers a plea of involuntary manslaughter with 3 years' probation. Gerard privately talks to Red and convinces him to take the deal as it will keep Liz safe and out of prison and is better than Gerard expected them to get. Gerard later presents the deal to Liz who reluctantly signs it as she will no longer able to be an FBI agent though she can remain on the task force in a similar capacity to Red. Thanks to Gerard's deal, Liz is later able to walk free. In \"The Apothecary\", Red believes Gerard poisoned him and is destroying his organization until it's revealed to be Dembe. In \"Philomena\", Gerard is kidnapped by a bounty hunter, Philomena, who works for Mr. Kaplan.

He witnessed his parents' murder at a very young age. He faked his own death after carrying out his very first bomb attack, adopted the pseudonym \"Zal Bin Hasaan\", and began a career as a feared and vicious terrorist. He evaded capture for many years, despite the best efforts of an elite Mossad task force dedicated to hunting him down. He resurfaced in America, where he abducted six technicians working on Israel's Iron Dome defense system. Posing as a hostage, he was reunited with his sister, claiming he had gone into hiding to avoid persecution. He and his men infiltrated a Mossad compound, seeking a list that contained the names of the members of the task force. However, Samar and her ex-partner destroyed it when she found out his actions as a terrorist. He was captured by Red and Samar disowns Shahin, believing that he died with their parents. Red turned him over to unnamed associates in exchange for a favor.\n\n=== Artax Network ===\nThe '''Artax Network''' (Blacklister No. 41) is a defunct network of communications satellites that was intended to provide data coverage throughout the globe.

Her father was named Dom.\n\nIn \"Cape May\", it is revealed that Reddington believed that she had committed suicide by drowning to protect Liz from unknown individuals who were pursuing her. He continued to tell Liz that her mother was dead, despite receiving a painting commissioned by someone who claimed to be Rostova. However, Liz and Tom suspected she was alive. Katarina had left a journal in the house that Kirk claimed Liz grew up in and while reading it, she learns more about Katarina's affair with Red along with the Rostov family's long history with a rare cancer.\n\nIn the season 4 episode \"Requiem\", it is revealed that Katarina hired Mr. Kaplan to be Liz's nanny. During this time, Katarina was forced to kill a Soviet agent in self-defense; Kaplan disposed of the body. Later, Katarina tells Kaplan that Reddington kidnapped Liz, believing her to be his daughter. She was unaware that he took Liz to America to live with his family out of a need to protect both her and Katarina from not only Kirk/Rostov (who found out about the affair) but also Berlin/Kirchoff who was attacking him. Katarina rescued Liz, but was forced to flee when both the US and Russian governments began hunting her. She asked Kaplan to leave Liz in the care of the man who would become her foster father, Sam.\n\nIn \"Mr. Kaplan Conclusion\", before her suicide Kaplan prayed for Katarina to forgive her as she dug up the suitcase and left it in a storage locker. The suitcase was later retrieved by Tom Keen and opened it to discover skeletal remains that apparently belong to the real Raymond Reddington.\n\nIn \"Rassvet,\" it is revealed that Katarina was a double agent working both for the Cabal and the KGB. The real Reddington was the man shot by Liz on the night of the fire from which he was pulled by Katarina and her lover Ilya Koslov in an attempt to save Reddington's life. However, Reddington died of his injuries and the two covered up his death, leading to Reddington being declared missing. Katarina's apparent suicide was to fake her death, but her survival was exposed to Anton Velov when Katarina intervened to stop a rape at a shelter she was living at. After a brief period in hiding, she and Ilya traveled to Moscow to warn her father, who was also her KGB handler, to leave Russia to escape the Soviet government's reprisals for her treason. Later she tried to kill herself, but was stopped by Ilya. She then agreed to his proposal to assume Raymond Reddington's identity and gain access to his accounts, to protect her and her daughter Masha from the Cabal and to stop Reddington from being discredited as she knew he would be. In the present, Liz locates Katarina's father who reveals that twenty-eight years before, Katarina visited him and promised to send Dom a letter to a post office box once it was safe for her again. Though Dom checks every week, Katarina has not sent one letter despite it having been nearly thirty years. Dom is unsure if she is still alive, convinced that Katarina would've made contact if she was still around.\n\nIn \"Robert Diaz\" Katarina is revealed to be alive and living in Paris. When Red/Ilya appeared to warn her about the former KGB's newest assassination attempt on her life, Katarina briefly kisses him before stabbing him in the stomach. A group of men takes Red away in a car and she leaves carrying only his hat.\n\nKatarina brutally interrogates Reddington for information on an unnamed group that is pursuing her. After Reddington escapes to Dom's house, Katarina makes an unsuccessful attempt to recapture him. She then moves into an apartment across the hall from Liz, posing as Madeleine Tolliver, a friendly retiree with an estranged daughter. She begins insinuating herself into Liz's life, installing surveillance devices in Liz's apartment and babysitting Agnes. While taking Agnes to the park, she inadvertently allows Agnes to see the dead body of an assailant she killed.\n\nUsing knowledge gleaned from her surveillance, she finds and kidnaps \"Frank Bloom\", addressing him as Ilya Koslov and torturing him for information on an attempt on her life he helped engineer years ago in Belgrade. After Liz discovers \"Madeleine\" is an imposter and confronts her at gunpoint, Katarina admits she is Liz's mother. Katarina abducts Liz and tells her that Frank Bloom, not Reddington, is the real Ilya Koslov, and that both Reddington and Dom are lying. Liz helps her escape when the FBI closes in on her location. Reddington is tailing Katarina when a car runs into her vehicle and two assassins shoot her and drag away the body. It is later revealed that Katarina faked her own death to convince Reddington to stop hunting her. She contacts Liz, promising to return when she has found out who is pursuing her.\n\n===Alexander Kirk===\n[[File:Ulrich Thomsen o.jpg|thumb|170px|Alexander Kirk is portrayed by [[Ulrich Thomsen]]]]\nPortrayed by [[Ulrich Thomsen]]\n\n'''Alexander Kirk''' (Blacklister No. 14), born '''Constantin Rostov''', is a powerful billionaire businessman who made his fortune buying up Russian companies after the fall of the Soviet Union.

After Liz faked her death, he hires an assassin to kill Tom Keen and take Agnes. Reddington and Hargrave steal $300&nbsp;million from Senator Diaz, a presidential candidate Kirk was backing, in an attempt to lure Kirk to the United States, but Kirk does not take the bait. After Reddington frames him for selling oil to rebels, Kirk is forced to appear before a congressional committee to testify. He changes his mind at the last minute when his men discover Liz is alive. He has Liz kidnapped and brought to him, and tells her that he is her father.\n\nLiz is in disbelief at Kirk's claims and doesn't trust him. So Kirk takes her to the house he claimed she grew up in, near Nova Scotia. When the FBI rescued her, Kirk decides to continue his revenge on Red by keeping Agnes from him. Red reveals why Kirk had kidnapped both Liz and Agnes in the first place: he is dying of a rare genetic blood disease which female relatives do not share. Kirk intends to use Liz for a bone marrow transplant to save his own life. In \"Dr. Adrian Shaw\", Liz attempts to save Kirk through the transplant; but the DNA test performed by the hospital reveals that Kirk is not her father. Angered by the fact that he lied to her and sent her falsified DNA transcripts, Liz abandons Kirk. In \"Dr. Adrian Shaw: Conclusion\", Kirk escapes the hospital with Liz and is upset to learn he really isn't her father. Kirk trades Liz for Red though the person he sends to release Liz safely tries to kill her, saying that Kirk used to be a good man until he saw her on TV on the run from the Cabal and became obsessed with her. Liz is rescued by Ressler and Samar and with Aram's help, tracks down Kirk's location. Kirk tortures Red who confesses to being Liz's father and brings Kirk a cure. Kirk decides to kill Red rather than release him in exchange for the cure and the two men reminisce over Katarina Rostova. As Kirk goes to kill Red, Red whispers something in his ear that causes Kirk to stop. Both men disappear from Kirk's lab afterwards and later that night, Red tells Liz that Kirk is \"gone\". When Liz asks if Kirk is dead, all Red will say is that Kirk is gone with no further explanation. In \"Lipet's Seafood Company\", it's confirmed that Red allowed Kirk to escape. Cooper berates Red for this, but Red simply tells him that Kirk is gone and won't be coming back and insists they move on.\n\n===Mr. Kaplan===\nPortrayed by [[Susan Blommaert]] and [[Joanna P.

This does not rely upon [[unspent transaction outputs]] (UTXOs). The state denotes the current balances of all accounts and extra data. The state is not stored on the blockchain, it is stored in a separate [[Merkle tree|Merkle]] Patricia tree. A [[cryptocurrency wallet]] stores the [[Public-key cryptography|public and private \"keys\"]] or \"addresses\" which can be used to receive or spend ether. These can be generated through BIP 39 style mnemonics for a BIP 32 \"HD Wallet\". In Ethereum, this is unnecessary as it does not operate in a UTXO scheme. With the private key, it is possible to write in the blockchain, effectively making an ether transaction.\n\nTo send ether to an account, you need the [[SHA-3|Keccak-256]] hash of the public key of that account.

There is also a research-oriented language under development called Vyper (a [[Strong and weak typing|strongly-typed]] [[Python (programming language)|Python]]-derived [[Recursive language|decidable language]]).\n\nSmart contracts can be public, which opens up the possibility to prove functionality, e.g. self-contained [[provably fair]] casinos.<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Piasecki |first=Piotr J. |year=2016 |title=Gaming Self-Contained Provably Fair Smart Contract Casinos |url=http://www.ledgerjournal.org/ojs/index.php/ledger/article/view/29 |journal=[[Ledger (journal)|Ledger]] |volume=1 |pages=99\u2013110 |doi=10.5195/ledger.2016.29 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161224031048/http://www.ledgerjournal.org/ojs/index.php/ledger/article/view/29 |archivedate=24 December 2016 |doi-access=free }}</ref>\n\nOne issue related to using smart contracts on a public blockchain is that bugs, including security holes, are visible to all but cannot be fixed quickly.<ref name=\"Peck20160528\">{{cite web |url=https://spectrum.ieee.org/tech-talk/computing/networks/ethereums-150-million-dollar-dao-opens-for-business-just-as-researchers-call-for-a-moratorium |title=Ethereum's $150-Million Blockchain-Powered Fund Opens Just as Researchers Call For a Halt |first=M. |last=Peck |date=28 May 2016 |work=[[IEEE Spectrum]] |publisher=[[Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers]] |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160530202345/https://spectrum.ieee.org/tech-talk/computing/networks/ethereums-150-million-dollar-dao-opens-for-business-just-as-researchers-call-for-a-moratorium |archivedate=30 May 2016 }}</ref> One example of this is the 17 June 2016 attack on The DAO, which could not be quickly stopped or reversed.<ref name=\"NYTDAOHACK\" />\n\nThere is ongoing research on how to use formal verification to express and prove non-trivial properties.

This does not rely upon [[unspent transaction outputs]] (UTXOs). The state denotes the current balances of all accounts and extra data. The state is not stored on the blockchain, it is stored in a separate [[Merkle tree|Merkle]] Patricia tree. A [[cryptocurrency wallet]] stores the [[Public-key cryptography|public and private \"keys\"]] or \"addresses\" which can be used to receive or spend ether. These can be generated through BIP 39 style mnemonics for a BIP 32 \"HD Wallet\". In Ethereum, this is unnecessary as it does not operate in a UTXO scheme. With the private key, it is possible to write in the blockchain, effectively making an ether transaction.\n\nTo send ether to an account, you need the [[SHA-3|Keccak-256]] hash of the public key of that account.

In 2017, mining generated 9.2 million new ether, corresponding to a 10% increase in its total supply. Casper the Friendly Finality Gadget (FFG), which is a hybrid Proof of Work and Proof of Stake scheme, and Casper Correct-By-Construction (CBC), a separate Proof of Stake design of Casper, are expected to reduce the inflation rate to between 0.5% to 2%.{{citation needed|date=May 2019}} There is no currently implemented hard cap on the total supply of ETH.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://thenextweb.com/hardfork/2018/06/11/ethereums-total-supply/|title=Ethereum's supply has crossed 100M, here's what that means|last=Varshney|first=Neer|date=11 June 2018|website=Hard Fork {{!}} The Next Web|language=en-us|access-date=25 May 2019}}</ref>\n\n===Markets and stores===\nEther can be traded by regular currency [[brokers]], [[cryptocurrency exchanges]], as well as many online [[cryptocurrency wallet]]s.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-10-11/fans-of-digital-currency-ether-can-now-buy-etns-in-sweden|title=Fans of Digital Currency Ether Can Now Buy ETNs\u2014In Sweden|author=Olga Kharif|date=11 October 2017|website=[[Bloomberg L.P.|Bloomberg]]}}</ref>\n\n== Platform ==\n\n=== Virtual Machine ===\nThe Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) is the runtime environment for smart contracts in Ethereum.
