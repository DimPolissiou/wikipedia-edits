Goenka: ''The Coins of the Indian Sultanates'', New Delhi: Munshiram Manoharlal, 2001.</ref><ref name=\"sen2\">{{Cite book |last=Sen |first=Sailendra |title=A Textbook of Medieval Indian History |publisher=Primus Books |year=2013 |isbn=978-9-38060-734-4 |pages=98}}</ref> In 1388, Feroz Shah Tughlaq appointed Malik Sarwar, a [[Eunuch (court official)|eunuch]], who is notorious for having been the lover of Feroz Shah Tughlaq's daughter, as the governor of the region. The Sultanate was in disarray because of factional fighting for power, and in 1393 Malik Sarwar declared independence. He and his adopted son Mubarak Shah founded what came to be known as the [[Sharqi dynasty]] (dynasty of the East). During the Sharqi period the Jaunpur Sultanate was a strong military power in Northern India, and on several occasions threatened the Delhi Sultanate.2\n\n[[File:Silver Coin of Ibrahim Shah of Jaunpur.jpg|thumb|right|208x208px|coin of 32 rattis issued by Ibrahim Shah of Jaunpur.]]\n[[File:The War Elephants Citranand and Udiya Collide in Battle.jpg|thumb|It depicts the elephant Citranand attacking another, called Udiya, during the Mughal campaign against the rebel forces of Khan Zaman and Bahadur Khan in 1567.]]\n\nThe Jaunpur Sultanate attained its greatest height under the younger brother of Mubarak Shah, who ruled as Shams-ud-din Ibrahim Shah (ruled 1402-1440). To the east, his kingdom extended to Bihar, and to the west, to Kanauj; he even marched on Delhi at one point. Under the aegis of a Muslim holy man named Qutb al-Alam, he threatened the [[Sultanate of Bengal]] under [[Raja Ganesha]].<ref>Goron and Goenka, p. 343.</ref>\n\nDuring the reign of Husain Shah (1456\u201376), the Jaunpur army was perhaps the biggest in India, and Husain decided to attempt a conquest of Delhi. However, he was defeated on three successive attempts by [[Bahlul Khan Lodi]]. It is a dominant trend in modern historiography of the period that this defeat was a cause of a large number of eunuchs in the military ranks. Finally, under [[Sikandar Lodi]], the Delhi Sultante was able to reconquer Jaunpur in 1493, bringing that sultanate to an end.\n\nThe Jaunpur Sultanate was a major center of [[Urdu]] and [[Sufi]] knowledge and culture. The Sharqi dynasty was known for its excellent communal relations between [[Muslim]]s and [[Hindu]]s, perhaps stemming from the fact that the Sharqis themselves were originally indigenous converts to Islam, as opposed to descendants of [[Persian people|Persians]] or [[Afghan people|Afghans]]. Jaunpur's independence came to an end in 1480, when the city was conquered by [[Sikander Lodhi]], the Sultan of [[Delhi]]. The Sharqi kings attempted for several years to retake the city, but ultimately failed.\n\nAlthough many of the Sharqi monuments were destroyed when the [[Lodi dynasty|Lodi]]s took the city, several important [[mosque]]s remain, most notably the [[Atala Masjid, Jaunpur|Atala Masjid]], [[Jama Masjid, Jaunpur|Jama Masjid]] (now known as the Bari (big mosque) Masjid) and the [[Lal Darwaza Masjid, Jaunpur|Lal Darwaza Masjid]].  The Jaunpur mosques display a unique architectural style, combining traditional Hindu and Muslim motifs with purely original elements.  The old bridge over the [[Gomti River]] in Jaunpur dates from 1564, the era of the [[Mughal Empire|Mughal]] [[Emperor Akbar]]. The Jaunpur Qila, a fortress from the [[Tughlaq]] era, also remains in good form.\n\nJaunpur district was annexed into [[British India]] based on the Permanent settlement of 1779, and thus was subject to the [[Zamindar]]i system of land revenue collection. During the [[Revolt of 1857]] the [[Sikh]] troops in Jaunpur joined the Indian rebels. The district was eventually reconquered for the British by [[Gurkha]] troops from [[Nepal]]. Jaunpur then became a district administrative center.\n\n==Present state==\n\nJaunpur is the district headquarters. The district has 2 [[Lok Sabha]] and 9 [[Vidhan Sabha]] constituencies.\n\n== Demographics ==\nAs per [[2011 Indian Census]], Jaunpur NPP had population of 180,362 of which male and female were 93,718 and 86,644 respectively, that is a sex ratio of 1000 males per 924 females. Child population in the age range of 0-6 years was 22,710. The total number of literates in Jaunpur was 128,050, which constituted 71% of the population with male literacy of 75.2% and female literacy of 66.5%. The effective literacy rate of 7+ population of Jaunpur was 81.2%, of which male literacy rate was 86.1% and female literacy rate was 75.9%.

The Sultanate was in disarray because of factional fighting for power, and in 1393 Malik Sarwar declared independence. He and his adopted son Mubarak Shah founded what came to be known as the [[Sharqi dynasty]] (dynasty of the East). During the Sharqi period the Jaunpur Sultanate was a strong military power in Northern India, and on several occasions threatened the Delhi Sultanate.2\n\n[[File:Silver Coin of Ibrahim Shah of Jaunpur.jpg|thumb|right|208x208px|coin of 32 rattis issued by Ibrahim Shah of Jaunpur.]]\n[[File:The War Elephants Citranand and Udiya Collide in Battle.jpg|thumb|It depicts the elephant Citranand attacking another, called Udiya, during the Mughal campaign against the rebel forces of Khan Zaman and Bahadur Khan in 1567.]]\n\nThe Jaunpur Sultanate attained its greatest height under the younger brother of Mubarak Shah, who ruled as Shams-ud-din Ibrahim Shah (ruled 1402-1440). To the east, his kingdom extended to Bihar, and to the west, to Kanauj; he even marched on Delhi at one point. Under the aegis of a Muslim holy man named Qutb al-Alam, he threatened the [[Sultanate of Bengal]] under [[Raja Ganesha]].<ref>Goron and Goenka, p. 343.</ref>\n\nDuring the reign of Husain Shah (1456\u201376), the Jaunpur army was perhaps the biggest in India, and Husain decided to attempt a conquest of Delhi. However, he was defeated on three successive attempts by [[Bahlul Khan Lodi]]. It is a dominant trend in modern historiography of the period that this defeat was a cause of a large number of eunuchs in the military ranks. Finally, under [[Sikandar Lodi]], the Delhi Sultante was able to reconquer Jaunpur in 1493, bringing that sultanate to an end.\n\nThe Jaunpur Sultanate was a major center of [[Urdu]] and [[Sufi]] knowledge and culture. The Sharqi dynasty was known for its excellent communal relations between [[Muslim]]s and [[Hindu]]s, perhaps stemming from the fact that the Sharqis themselves were originally indigenous converts to Islam, as opposed to descendants of [[Persian people|Persians]] or [[Afghan people|Afghans]]. Jaunpur's independence came to an end in 1480, when the city was conquered by [[Sikander Lodhi]], the Sultan of [[Delhi]]. The Sharqi kings attempted for several years to retake the city, but ultimately failed.\n\nAlthough many of the Sharqi monuments were destroyed when the [[Lodi dynasty|Lodi]]s took the city, several important [[mosque]]s remain, most notably the [[Atala Masjid, Jaunpur|Atala Masjid]], [[Jama Masjid, Jaunpur|Jama Masjid]] (now known as the Bari (big mosque) Masjid) and the [[Lal Darwaza Masjid, Jaunpur|Lal Darwaza Masjid]].  The Jaunpur mosques display a unique architectural style, combining traditional Hindu and Muslim motifs with purely original elements.  The old bridge over the [[Gomti River]] in Jaunpur dates from 1564, the era of the [[Mughal Empire|Mughal]] [[Emperor Akbar]]. The Jaunpur Qila, a fortress from the [[Tughlaq]] era, also remains in good form.\n\nJaunpur district was annexed into [[British India]] based on the Permanent settlement of 1779, and thus was subject to the [[Zamindar]]i system of land revenue collection. During the [[Revolt of 1857]] the [[Sikh]] troops in Jaunpur joined the Indian rebels. The district was eventually reconquered for the British by [[Gurkha]] troops from [[Nepal]]. Jaunpur then became a district administrative center.\n\n==Present state==\n\nJaunpur is the district headquarters. The district has 2 [[Lok Sabha]] and 9 [[Vidhan Sabha]] constituencies.\n\n== Demographics ==\nAs per [[2011 Indian Census]], Jaunpur NPP had population of 180,362 of which male and female were 93,718 and 86,644 respectively, that is a sex ratio of 1000 males per 924 females. Child population in the age range of 0-6 years was 22,710. The total number of literates in Jaunpur was 128,050, which constituted 71% of the population with male literacy of 75.2% and female literacy of 66.5%. The effective literacy rate of 7+ population of Jaunpur was 81.2%, of which male literacy rate was 86.1% and female literacy rate was 75.9%.

As the player levels up, they are able to spend skill points to boost their attributes on a scale of one to fifteen. Players are able to choose perks, or passive abilities that offer gameplay bonuses. These perks fall into each of the SPECIAL categories and take the form of trading cards. Each card has a value and the player can adopt perks equal to their respective value; for example, if the player has a strength rating of five, then they may equip strength perks worth five points. The player can merge similar cards together to create more powerful\u2014albeit more expensive\u2014perks. The system is designed to encourage the player to recognise the situation they are in and choose perks that aid them rather than passively selecting them and having them for the duration of the game.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.polygon.com/fallout-76-guide/2018/10/24/18018550/perk-cards-special-leveling|title=Fallout 76 guide to leveling, SPECIAL and Perk Cards|last=Good|first=Owen|date=October 24, 2019|work=Polygon|access-date=March 18, 2019}}</ref>\n\n''Fallout 76'' does not feature any human non-player characters (NPCs) as all surviving humans are other players.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://twitter.com/BethesdaStudios/status/1006003558502752256 |title=Bethesda Game Studios on Twitter |website=[[Twitter]] |access-date=June 11, 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180611124134/https://twitter.com/BethesdaStudios/status/1006003558502752256# |archive-date=June 11, 2018 |url-status=live}}</ref>{{citation needed|date=June 2019}} This required Bethesda to change their approach to storytelling as previous games in the series relied on NPCs to assign quests, engage the player in dialog and advance the overall narrative.

The player character exits the Vault on \"Reclamation Day\" as part of a plan to re-colonize the Wasteland.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2018/05/31/fallout-76-the-history-of-vault-76-and-what-it-means-for-fallout-76 |title=Fallout 76: The History Of Vault 76 And What It Means For Fallout 76 |first=Tom |last=Marks |date=May 31, 2018 |access-date=June 11, 2018 |work=[[IGN]] |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180611165612/http://www.ign.com/articles/2018/05/31/fallout-76-the-history-of-vault-76-and-what-it-means-for-fallout-76# |archive-date=June 11, 2018 |url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n===Plot===\nTwenty-five years after the [[World War III|Great War]], Vault 76 is opened up and its residents given the task of repopulating the Wasteland. Shortly after they emerge from the Vault, the player character is contacted by the Vault Overseer. She reveals that Vault 76 was given a secret mandate to secure an arsenal of nuclear weapons deployed throughout Appalachia in three still-functioning nuclear missile silos: Site Alpha, Site Bravo, and Site Charlie. The player character is directed to contact the First Responders, a faction of emergency services personnel who tried to aid the residents of Appalachia during the war; however, they discover that the First Responders evacuated after they came under attack from the Scorched. Further investigation reveals that the Scorched are ghouls infected by the breath of a Scorchbeast, a creature that was awoken after the Great War.\n\nAs the Scorched represent a threat to the Wasteland beyond Appalachia, the player character decides to secure a nuclear weapon and use it to destroy a Scorchbeast nest. In order to achieve this, they start searching the bunkers of survivalists calling themselves the Free States who were working on the means to detect the Scorched until the Scorched overran them. The player character is able to build a radar system that detects the viral signature of the Scorched, but its limited range makes it ineffective, even after helping boost the signal with gaining the friendship of Rose, a Miss Nanny robot trying to rebuild the local Raider gangs that lived in Appalachia before being scared off by the Scorched, and investigating the Scorchbeasts further through the research done by the local Brotherhood of Steel as they had tried to halt the spread of the Scorchbeasts from their main lair. They hack into a government network and draw the attention of the Enclave, the remnants of the United States government. The Enclave are led by MODUS, a centralized artificial intelligence system located in a secure nuclear fallout bunker beneath the Whitespring Resort. MODUS asks the player character to help connect them to a series of isolated computer networks across Appalachia, and in return offers to connect to the radar system to detect Scorched across the region.\n\nOnce MODUS is connected, they are able to identify the Scorchbeast nest at a location called Fissure Site Prime, close to where the Brotherhood of Steel had made their ultimate attempt to stop the Scorchbeast threat themselves and failed. The player character is directed to one of the three nuclear silos and they launch a missile at the nest. Venturing into the irradiated area, they uncover a laboratory at the center of the nest that was also found by the Brotherhood of Steel, implying that the Scorchbeasts were man-made. The explosion awakens a Scorchbeast Queen, and the player is forced to fight her. With the Queen defeated, the Scorchbeasts' hive mind is broken, and the threat to the wasteland beyond Appalachia is halted. The player character rejoins the other residents of Vault 76 in rebuilding the Wasteland.\n\n== Development ==\n''Fallout 76'' uses a modified version of Bethesda's [[Creation Engine]] designed to accommodate multiplayer gameplay.<ref name=\"Noclip\">{{cite web |author1=[[Noclip]] |title=The Making of Fallout 76 \u2013 Noclip Documentary |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gi8PTAJ2Hjs |website=[[YouTube]] |access-date=June 17, 2018 |date=June 12, 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180617050330/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gi8PTAJ2Hjs# |archive-date=June 17, 2018 |url-status=live}}</ref> Work on modifying the engine was carried out by [[Bethesda Game Studios Austin]].<ref name=\"Noclip\" /> The modified engine allowed the development team to incorporate new lighting models, rendering processes and more accurate terrain mapping.

Character attributes fall into one of seven categories: strength, perception, endurance, charisma, intelligence, agility and luck. As the player levels up, they are able to spend skill points to boost their attributes on a scale of one to fifteen. Players are able to choose perks, or passive abilities that offer gameplay bonuses. These perks fall into each of the SPECIAL categories and take the form of trading cards. Each card has a value and the player can adopt perks equal to their respective value; for example, if the player has a strength rating of five, then they may equip strength perks worth five points. The player can merge similar cards together to create more powerful\u2014albeit more expensive\u2014perks. The system is designed to encourage the player to recognise the situation they are in and choose perks that aid them rather than passively selecting them and having them for the duration of the game.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.polygon.com/fallout-76-guide/2018/10/24/18018550/perk-cards-special-leveling|title=Fallout 76 guide to leveling, SPECIAL and Perk Cards|last=Good|first=Owen|date=October 24, 2019|work=Polygon|access-date=March 18, 2019}}</ref>\n\n''Fallout 76'' does not feature any human non-player characters (NPCs) as all surviving humans are other players.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://twitter.com/BethesdaStudios/status/1006003558502752256 |title=Bethesda Game Studios on Twitter |website=[[Twitter]] |access-date=June 11, 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180611124134/https://twitter.com/BethesdaStudios/status/1006003558502752256# |archive-date=June 11, 2018 |url-status=live}}</ref>{{citation needed|date=June 2019}} This required Bethesda to change their approach to storytelling as previous games in the series relied on NPCs to assign quests, engage the player in dialog and advance the overall narrative.

Shortly after they emerge from the Vault, the player character is contacted by the Vault Overseer. She reveals that Vault 76 was given a secret mandate to secure an arsenal of nuclear weapons deployed throughout Appalachia in three still-functioning nuclear missile silos: Site Alpha, Site Bravo, and Site Charlie. The player character is directed to contact the First Responders, a faction of emergency services personnel who tried to aid the residents of Appalachia during the war; however, they discover that the First Responders evacuated after they came under attack from the Scorched. Further investigation reveals that the Scorched are ghouls infected by the breath of a Scorchbeast, a creature that was awoken after the Great War.\n\nAs the Scorched represent a threat to the Wasteland beyond Appalachia, the player character decides to secure a nuclear weapon and use it to destroy a Scorchbeast nest. In order to achieve this, they start searching the bunkers of survivalists calling themselves the Free States who were working on the means to detect the Scorched until the Scorched overran them. The player character is able to build a radar system that detects the viral signature of the Scorched, but its limited range makes it ineffective, even after helping boost the signal with gaining the friendship of Rose, a Miss Nanny robot trying to rebuild the local Raider gangs that lived in Appalachia before being scared off by the Scorched, and investigating the Scorchbeasts further through the research done by the local Brotherhood of Steel as they had tried to halt the spread of the Scorchbeasts from their main lair. They hack into a government network and draw the attention of the Enclave, the remnants of the United States government. The Enclave are led by MODUS, a centralized artificial intelligence system located in a secure nuclear fallout bunker beneath the Whitespring Resort. MODUS asks the player character to help connect them to a series of isolated computer networks across Appalachia, and in return offers to connect to the radar system to detect Scorched across the region.\n\nOnce MODUS is connected, they are able to identify the Scorchbeast nest at a location called Fissure Site Prime, close to where the Brotherhood of Steel had made their ultimate attempt to stop the Scorchbeast threat themselves and failed. The player character is directed to one of the three nuclear silos and they launch a missile at the nest. Venturing into the irradiated area, they uncover a laboratory at the center of the nest that was also found by the Brotherhood of Steel, implying that the Scorchbeasts were man-made. The explosion awakens a Scorchbeast Queen, and the player is forced to fight her. With the Queen defeated, the Scorchbeasts' hive mind is broken, and the threat to the wasteland beyond Appalachia is halted. The player character rejoins the other residents of Vault 76 in rebuilding the Wasteland.\n\n== Development ==\n''Fallout 76'' uses a modified version of Bethesda's [[Creation Engine]] designed to accommodate multiplayer gameplay.<ref name=\"Noclip\">{{cite web |author1=[[Noclip]] |title=The Making of Fallout 76 \u2013 Noclip Documentary |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gi8PTAJ2Hjs |website=[[YouTube]] |access-date=June 17, 2018 |date=June 12, 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180617050330/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gi8PTAJ2Hjs# |archive-date=June 17, 2018 |url-status=live}}</ref> Work on modifying the engine was carried out by [[Bethesda Game Studios Austin]].<ref name=\"Noclip\" /> The modified engine allowed the development team to incorporate new lighting models, rendering processes and more accurate terrain mapping.
