[[Brunswick Records]] released it on February 28, 1936<ref>\"Louis Prima in Chronology 1935-1936\" album; Complete jazz Series Collection; Classics (viewed on Google Play Music)</ref> on the 78{{nbsp}}rpm record format, with \"It's Been So Long\" as the B-side. The song is strongly identified with the [[big band]] and [[swing era]]s. Several have performed the piece as an instrumental, including [[Fletcher Henderson]] and, most famously, [[Benny Goodman]].\n\n==Benny Goodman recording==\nOn July 6, 1937, \"Sing, Sing, Sing\" was recorded in Hollywood with [[Benny Goodman]] on clarinet; [[Harry James]], [[Ziggy Elman]], and [[Chris Griffin (musician)|Chris Griffin]] on trumpets; Red Ballard and [[Murray McEachern]] on trombones; [[Hymie Schertzer]] and George Koenig on alto saxophones; [[Art Rollini]] and [[Vido Musso]] on tenor saxophone; [[Jess Stacy]] on piano; [[Allan Reuss]] on guitar; Harry Goodman on bass; and [[Gene Krupa]] on drums.  The song was arranged by [[Jimmy Mundy]].  Unlike most big band arrangements of that era, limited in length to three minutes so that they could be recorded on one side of a standard 10-inch 78-rpm record, the version which Goodman\u2019s band recorded was an extended work. The 1937 recording lasted 8 min 43 seconds, and it took up both sides of a 12-inch 78.  At its longest, the recording of Goodman's 1938 Carnegie Hall live performance (with impromptu solos) took 12 minutes and 30 seconds. Mundy's arrangement incorporated \"[[Christopher Columbus (jazz_song)|Christopher Columbus]],\" a piece written by [[Chu Berry]] for the [[Fletcher Henderson]] band, as well as Prima's work. Fletcher Henderson recorded a vocal version in August, 1936.<ref>https://adp.library.ucsb.edu/index.php/matrix/detail/200023550/BS-100883-Sing_sing_sing_With_a_swing</ref> The 1937 Benny Goodman recording was inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame in 1982.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.grammy.org/recording-academy/awards/hall-of-fame#s|title=GRAMMY Hall Of Fame|website=The GRAMMYs|access-date=2016-11-13}}</ref>\n\nRoss Firestone says that the 1937 recording \"bore only the slightest resemblance to the original score.\" Helen Ward said that the changes started spontaneously: \"One night Gene just refused to stop drumming when he got to the end of the third chorus, where the tune was supposed to end, so Benny blithely picked up the clarinet and noodled along with him. Then someone else stood up and took it, and it went on from there.\" Firestone says the elements from \"Christopher Columbus\" were added this way. <ref>Firestone, Ross ''Sing, Sing, Sing The Life & Times of Benny Goodman,'' W. W. Norton & Company, New York, London, 1993, p. 161.</ref> The title of the number as given on the Goodman recordings acknowledges the additional tune - \"Sing, Sing, Sing (introducing Christopher Columbus)\u201d.\n\nIn their 1966 book ''Hear Me Talkin\u2019 To Ya: The Story Of Jazz As Told By The Men Who Made It,'' music critics [[Nat Shapiro]] and [[Nat Hentoff]] quote Goodman as saying, \"'Sing, Sing, Sing' (which we started doing back at the [[Palomar Ballroom|Palomar]] on our second trip there in 1936) was a big thing, and no one-nighter was complete without it.\"<ref>Shapiro, Nat, and Hentoff, Nat.

[[Brunswick Records]] released it on February 28, 1936<ref>\"Louis Prima in Chronology 1935-1936\" album; Complete jazz Series Collection; Classics (viewed on Google Play Music)</ref> on the 78{{nbsp}}rpm record format, with \"It's Been So Long\" as the B-side. The song is strongly identified with the [[big band]] and [[swing era]]s. Several have performed the piece as an instrumental, including [[Fletcher Henderson]] and, most famously, [[Benny Goodman]].\n\n==Benny Goodman recording==\nOn July 6, 1937, \"Sing, Sing, Sing\" was recorded in Hollywood with [[Benny Goodman]] on clarinet; [[Harry James]], [[Ziggy Elman]], and [[Chris Griffin (musician)|Chris Griffin]] on trumpets; Red Ballard and [[Murray McEachern]] on trombones; [[Hymie Schertzer]] and George Koenig on alto saxophones; [[Art Rollini]] and [[Vido Musso]] on tenor saxophone; [[Jess Stacy]] on piano; [[Allan Reuss]] on guitar; Harry Goodman on bass; and [[Gene Krupa]] on drums.  The song was arranged by [[Jimmy Mundy]].  Unlike most big band arrangements of that era, limited in length to three minutes so that they could be recorded on one side of a standard 10-inch 78-rpm record, the version which Goodman\u2019s band recorded was an extended work. The 1937 recording lasted 8 min 43 seconds, and it took up both sides of a 12-inch 78.  At its longest, the recording of Goodman's 1938 Carnegie Hall live performance (with impromptu solos) took 12 minutes and 30 seconds. Mundy's arrangement incorporated \"[[Christopher Columbus (jazz_song)|Christopher Columbus]],\" a piece written by [[Chu Berry]] for the [[Fletcher Henderson]] band, as well as Prima's work. Fletcher Henderson recorded a vocal version in August, 1936.<ref>https://adp.library.ucsb.edu/index.php/matrix/detail/200023550/BS-100883-Sing_sing_sing_With_a_swing</ref> The 1937 Benny Goodman recording was inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame in 1982.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.grammy.org/recording-academy/awards/hall-of-fame#s|title=GRAMMY Hall Of Fame|website=The GRAMMYs|access-date=2016-11-13}}</ref>\n\nRoss Firestone says that the 1937 recording \"bore only the slightest resemblance to the original score.\" Helen Ward said that the changes started spontaneously: \"One night Gene just refused to stop drumming when he got to the end of the third chorus, where the tune was supposed to end, so Benny blithely picked up the clarinet and noodled along with him. Then someone else stood up and took it, and it went on from there.\" Firestone says the elements from \"Christopher Columbus\" were added this way. <ref>Firestone, Ross ''Sing, Sing, Sing The Life & Times of Benny Goodman,'' W. W. Norton & Company, New York, London, 1993, p. 161.</ref> The title of the number as given on the Goodman recordings acknowledges the additional tune - \"Sing, Sing, Sing (introducing Christopher Columbus)\u201d.\n\nIn their 1966 book ''Hear Me Talkin\u2019 To Ya: The Story Of Jazz As Told By The Men Who Made It,'' music critics [[Nat Shapiro]] and [[Nat Hentoff]] quote Goodman as saying, \"'Sing, Sing, Sing' (which we started doing back at the [[Palomar Ballroom|Palomar]] on our second trip there in 1936) was a big thing, and no one-nighter was complete without it.\"<ref>Shapiro, Nat, and Hentoff, Nat.

It was the first flagship sedan sold under the [[Acura]] nameplate, until being renamed in 1996 as the [[Acura RL|Acura 3.5RL]]. The 3.5RL was the North American version of the KA9 series Honda Legend.\n\nThe opportunity for Japanese manufacturers to export more expensive models had arisen with the 1980s [[voluntary export restraint]]s, negotiated by the Japanese government and U.S. trade representatives, restricting mainstream car sales.<ref>{{Harvnb|Dawson|2004|pp=xix, 28}}</ref> The initial success of the Legend and Honda's Acura division in competing against established European and American luxury manufacturers would lead to Toyota and Nissan creating the [[Lexus]] and [[Infiniti]] brands, respectively, to compete in the luxury car market.\n\n{{TOC left}}\n{{clear}}\n\n==First generation (1985\u20131990)==\n{{Infobox automobile\n|name=First generation\n|image=1st-Acura-Legend.jpg\n|caption=1988 Acura Legend \"LS\" sedan \n|production=1985&ndash;1990 KA1-6 chassis\n|layout= [[Front-engine, front-wheel-drive layout|Transverse front-engine, front-wheel drive]]\n|engine=2.5 L ''[[Honda C engine#C25A|C25A]]'' [[V6]]<br />2.7 L ''[[Honda C engine#C27A|C27A]]'' [[V6]]\n|transmission=5-speed [[manual transmission|manual]]<br />4-speed [[automatic transmission|automatic]]\n|wheelbase=Sedan: {{convert|108.7|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}<br />Coupe: {{convert|106.5|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}\n|length=1985-88 Sedan: {{convert|189.4|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}<br />Coupe: {{convert|188|in|mm|1|abbr=on}}<br />1989-1990 Sedan: {{convert|190.6|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}\n|width=1989-1990 Sedan: {{convert|68.9|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}<br />1986-88 Sedan: {{convert|68.3|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}<br />Coupe: {{convert|68.7|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}\n|height=Sedan: {{convert|54.7|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}<br />Coupe: {{convert|53.9|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}\n|related=  [[Rover 800|Rover 800-series]]<br />[[Sterling (car)|Sterling 825/827]]\n|designer = Tetsuya Mizuno, Yukio Kurosu, Yoshio Ui (1982, 1984)\n}}\n\nHonda introduced the model in [[Japan]] on October 22, 1985, to be their premier luxury model, and in [[North America]] for the 1986 model year, as the top of the line model for its then-new [[Acura]] lineup. Sedan models came to the market first, powered by a {{Convert|151|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} 2.5&nbsp;L [[Honda C engine#C25A|C25A]] [[V6]], with coupes making their first appearance in 1987, powered by a new {{Convert|161|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} 2.7&nbsp;L [[Honda C engine#C27A|C27A]] engine. Sedans received the new engine for 1988.\n\nThe Legend was the first production Honda vehicle to offer a [[V6]] engine. The Legend was a result of a joint venture with Britain's [[Austin Rover Group]] called Project XX that started in November 1981 with the Austin Rover-Honda XX letter of intent signed by the two companies to replace the [[Rover SD1]] and to provide a luxury vehicle for Honda. The [[Rover Company]] had a long established reputation as a luxury car in the United Kingdom and Europe, demonstrated with the [[Rover P6]], and Honda wanted to introduce a luxury car for both domestic Japanese and the United States markets. The joint development produced the Legend and the corresponding British version was the [[Rover 800|Rover 800-series]], which was badged under the [[Sterling (car)|Sterling]] brand in the United States and competed with the Legend.\n\n[[File:1990 Acura Legend L, rear left.jpg|thumb|left|1990 Acura Legend L (US)]]\n\nRover also wanted to return to the American market when they had reportedly sold only 1,500 cars in 1971, and a brief return in 1980, selling 800 Rover SD1s by offering the Sterling.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.aronline.co.uk/index.htm?xxstoryf.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-11-20 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111003054246/http://www.aronline.co.uk/index.htm?xxstoryf.htm |archivedate=2011-10-03 }}</ref>\n\nThe Legend won ''[[Car and Driver]]''<nowiki/>'s ''Ten Best'' three years in a row and ''[[Motor Trend]]''<nowiki/>'s ''Import Car of the Year'' for 1987. Manual-equipped models could accelerate from 0-{{convert|60|mi/h|km/h|abbr=on}} in under 8 seconds and reach a top speed of {{convert|135|mi/h|km/h|abbr=on}}. Sedan models had a [[drag coefficient]] of 0.32, while coupes were only 0.30.\n\nWhen the Legend was introduced, Honda's newly established luxury car division just for the Legend was called Acura, using the advertising slogan \"Precision Crafted Performance\", and the Legend was offered with one factory installed option, the choice of transmission used, and one trim level. In the 1986 sales brochure, the Legend's full name used was \"Legend Touring Sedan\". The vehicle was virtually identical in luxury content to the Japanese market V6Zi, but was identical in size and the longer overall length of the top level V6Xi to comply with United States crash standards, using the larger 2.5 V6 engine. The [[Technics (brand)|Technics]] supplied 80W four speaker [[cassette tape]] stereo offered four user programmable equalizer settings, and was equipped with a dual diversity antenna, meaning it had a conventional extendable power antenna and an embedded antenna in the rear window. One of the novelty items was a simple volume control rocker switch and a pre-set radio station channel selector installed on the instrument binnacle within reach of the right hand; the opposite side of the instrument binnacle had a button to open, tilt or close the standard equipped glass [[moonroof]] with sun shade.\n\nThe North American Legend was not offered with some of the items offered in Japan, such as automatic, one touch climate control, and 100% wool cloth interior in brown. Blue interior was shared with Japan and North America, but brown was not offered in North America, and \"sand gray\" was offered instead. Exterior colors were matched to only one interior color choice and leather was not offered. Due to the success Honda had with the Legend, it served as an inspiration for the [[Subaru Legacy (first generation)|Subaru Legacy]] with which it shares many visual resemblances and dimensions both inside and out.\n\n[[File:1990 Acura Legend Coupe 2013.9.9.jpg|thumb|left|Acura Legend coupe]]\n\nIn late 1988 for the 1989 model year, the sedan received some minor tweaks, upgrading to the one-piece front headlamps already in use in Japan since the 1985 introduction, a revised front bumper, trunk lid, tail light cluster, and an upgraded double-wishbone rear suspension, with a new alloy wheel appearance. By that time all Legends came equipped with a Honda-designed 4-wheel anti-lock brake system. Other features such as power driver's seat memory for 3 positions were added. High-end LS models featured a driver's-side airbag, trip computer, electronic vehicle monitoring system in the center console and a [[Bose Corporation|Bose]] sound system. It was also joined by the [[Acura Vigor]] which set the stage for the larger second generation Legend introduced October 1990.<ref>http://www.hondanews.com/channels/acura-automobiles/archive/1989/releases/1989-acura-legend-specifications</ref>\n\nFor the 1990 model year, all Legends came with body-colored side mirrors.  Legend coupes had a revised body-colored front grille, new red & clear tail lights, and improved front seats.  LS model coupes also received a trunk-mounted lip spoiler. All LS models featured burlwood interior trim. Production of the first generation models ended in 1990 as a second generation version became available for the 1991 model year. At least by the 1990 model year, the fuel filler door on the sedan had been moved rearward about {{convert|15|cm|in|abbr=on}}.\n\nFrom the exterior, there are only superficial similarities between the Legend and its Rover 800/Sterling cousin.  Both cars share the 2.5L and 2.7L Honda engine with {{Convert|160|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} and a 4-speed automatic transmission.

The rear end appearance of the sedan was adopted from the first generation Legend coupe and Honda also wanted to visually align the appearance of both the Legend coupe and sedan to the [[Acura NSX]]. The segment the Legend originally filled was now being served by the [[Acura Vigor]] which allowed the Legend to position itself more towards the rear drive Lexus LS and the Infiniti Q45 sedans.

It was the first flagship sedan sold under the [[Acura]] nameplate, until being renamed in 1996 as the [[Acura RL|Acura 3.5RL]]. The 3.5RL was the North American version of the KA9 series Honda Legend.\n\nThe opportunity for Japanese manufacturers to export more expensive models had arisen with the 1980s [[voluntary export restraint]]s, negotiated by the Japanese government and U.S. trade representatives, restricting mainstream car sales.<ref>{{Harvnb|Dawson|2004|pp=xix, 28}}</ref> The initial success of the Legend and Honda's Acura division in competing against established European and American luxury manufacturers would lead to Toyota and Nissan creating the [[Lexus]] and [[Infiniti]] brands, respectively, to compete in the luxury car market.\n\n{{TOC left}}\n{{clear}}\n\n==First generation (1985\u20131990)==\n{{Infobox automobile\n|name=First generation\n|image=1st-Acura-Legend.jpg\n|caption=1988 Acura Legend \"LS\" sedan \n|production=1985&ndash;1990 KA1-6 chassis\n|layout= [[Front-engine, front-wheel-drive layout|Transverse front-engine, front-wheel drive]]\n|engine=2.5 L ''[[Honda C engine#C25A|C25A]]'' [[V6]]<br />2.7 L ''[[Honda C engine#C27A|C27A]]'' [[V6]]\n|transmission=5-speed [[manual transmission|manual]]<br />4-speed [[automatic transmission|automatic]]\n|wheelbase=Sedan: {{convert|108.7|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}<br />Coupe: {{convert|106.5|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}\n|length=1985-88 Sedan: {{convert|189.4|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}<br />Coupe: {{convert|188|in|mm|1|abbr=on}}<br />1989-1990 Sedan: {{convert|190.6|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}\n|width=1989-1990 Sedan: {{convert|68.9|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}<br />1986-88 Sedan: {{convert|68.3|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}<br />Coupe: {{convert|68.7|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}\n|height=Sedan: {{convert|54.7|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}<br />Coupe: {{convert|53.9|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}\n|related=  [[Rover 800|Rover 800-series]]<br />[[Sterling (car)|Sterling 825/827]]\n|designer = Tetsuya Mizuno, Yukio Kurosu, Yoshio Ui (1982, 1984)\n}}\n\nHonda introduced the model in [[Japan]] on October 22, 1985, to be their premier luxury model, and in [[North America]] for the 1986 model year, as the top of the line model for its then-new [[Acura]] lineup. Sedan models came to the market first, powered by a {{Convert|151|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} 2.5&nbsp;L [[Honda C engine#C25A|C25A]] [[V6]], with coupes making their first appearance in 1987, powered by a new {{Convert|161|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} 2.7&nbsp;L [[Honda C engine#C27A|C27A]] engine. Sedans received the new engine for 1988.\n\nThe Legend was the first production Honda vehicle to offer a [[V6]] engine. The Legend was a result of a joint venture with Britain's [[Austin Rover Group]] called Project XX that started in November 1981 with the Austin Rover-Honda XX letter of intent signed by the two companies to replace the [[Rover SD1]] and to provide a luxury vehicle for Honda. The [[Rover Company]] had a long established reputation as a luxury car in the United Kingdom and Europe, demonstrated with the [[Rover P6]], and Honda wanted to introduce a luxury car for both domestic Japanese and the United States markets. The joint development produced the Legend and the corresponding British version was the [[Rover 800|Rover 800-series]], which was badged under the [[Sterling (car)|Sterling]] brand in the United States and competed with the Legend.\n\n[[File:1990 Acura Legend L, rear left.jpg|thumb|left|1990 Acura Legend L (US)]]\n\nRover also wanted to return to the American market when they had reportedly sold only 1,500 cars in 1971, and a brief return in 1980, selling 800 Rover SD1s by offering the Sterling.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.aronline.co.uk/index.htm?xxstoryf.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-11-20 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111003054246/http://www.aronline.co.uk/index.htm?xxstoryf.htm |archivedate=2011-10-03 }}</ref>\n\nThe Legend won ''[[Car and Driver]]''<nowiki/>'s ''Ten Best'' three years in a row and ''[[Motor Trend]]''<nowiki/>'s ''Import Car of the Year'' for 1987. Manual-equipped models could accelerate from 0-{{convert|60|mi/h|km/h|abbr=on}} in under 8 seconds and reach a top speed of {{convert|135|mi/h|km/h|abbr=on}}. Sedan models had a [[drag coefficient]] of 0.32, while coupes were only 0.30.\n\nWhen the Legend was introduced, Honda's newly established luxury car division just for the Legend was called Acura, using the advertising slogan \"Precision Crafted Performance\", and the Legend was offered with one factory installed option, the choice of transmission used, and one trim level. In the 1986 sales brochure, the Legend's full name used was \"Legend Touring Sedan\". The vehicle was virtually identical in luxury content to the Japanese market V6Zi, but was identical in size and the longer overall length of the top level V6Xi to comply with United States crash standards, using the larger 2.5 V6 engine. The [[Technics (brand)|Technics]] supplied 80W four speaker [[cassette tape]] stereo offered four user programmable equalizer settings, and was equipped with a dual diversity antenna, meaning it had a conventional extendable power antenna and an embedded antenna in the rear window. One of the novelty items was a simple volume control rocker switch and a pre-set radio station channel selector installed on the instrument binnacle within reach of the right hand; the opposite side of the instrument binnacle had a button to open, tilt or close the standard equipped glass [[moonroof]] with sun shade.\n\nThe North American Legend was not offered with some of the items offered in Japan, such as automatic, one touch climate control, and 100% wool cloth interior in brown. Blue interior was shared with Japan and North America, but brown was not offered in North America, and \"sand gray\" was offered instead. Exterior colors were matched to only one interior color choice and leather was not offered. Due to the success Honda had with the Legend, it served as an inspiration for the [[Subaru Legacy (first generation)|Subaru Legacy]] with which it shares many visual resemblances and dimensions both inside and out.\n\n[[File:1990 Acura Legend Coupe 2013.9.9.jpg|thumb|left|Acura Legend coupe]]\n\nIn late 1988 for the 1989 model year, the sedan received some minor tweaks, upgrading to the one-piece front headlamps already in use in Japan since the 1985 introduction, a revised front bumper, trunk lid, tail light cluster, and an upgraded double-wishbone rear suspension, with a new alloy wheel appearance. By that time all Legends came equipped with a Honda-designed 4-wheel anti-lock brake system. Other features such as power driver's seat memory for 3 positions were added. High-end LS models featured a driver's-side airbag, trip computer, electronic vehicle monitoring system in the center console and a [[Bose Corporation|Bose]] sound system. It was also joined by the [[Acura Vigor]] which set the stage for the larger second generation Legend introduced October 1990.<ref>http://www.hondanews.com/channels/acura-automobiles/archive/1989/releases/1989-acura-legend-specifications</ref>\n\nFor the 1990 model year, all Legends came with body-colored side mirrors.  Legend coupes had a revised body-colored front grille, new red & clear tail lights, and improved front seats.  LS model coupes also received a trunk-mounted lip spoiler. All LS models featured burlwood interior trim. Production of the first generation models ended in 1990 as a second generation version became available for the 1991 model year. At least by the 1990 model year, the fuel filler door on the sedan had been moved rearward about {{convert|15|cm|in|abbr=on}}.\n\nFrom the exterior, there are only superficial similarities between the Legend and its Rover 800/Sterling cousin.  Both cars share the 2.5L and 2.7L Honda engine with {{Convert|160|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} and a 4-speed automatic transmission. The core structure and chassis design is also common to both cars, however the Rover version has its own exterior panelwork, interior and electrical systems. The Rover was also offered with a 2.0L in-line 4-cylinder engines in tune with European tastes, however the Legend was only available with V6 power regardless of market. In Japan only, Honda installed a turbocharger with variable geometry in the Legend with the smaller 2.0 L V6, called the [[Honda Legend#\"Wing Turbo\" version|\"Wing Turbo\"]] for model year 1989.\n\n==Second generation (1990\u20131995)==\n{{Infobox automobile\n|name=Second generation\n|image=Acura-Legend-Coupe.jpg\n| caption=2nd-gen Acura Legend coupe\n|production=1990&ndash;1995 KA7/KA8 - chassis\n|layout= [[Front-engine, front-wheel-drive layout|Longitudinal front-engine, front-wheel drive]]\n|engine=3.2 L ''[[Honda C engine#C32A|C32A]]'' [[V6]]\n|transmission=5-speed manual<br />4-speed automatic<br />6-speed manual\n|wheelbase=Coupe: {{convert|111.4|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}<br />Sedan: {{convert|114.6|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}\n|length=Sedan: {{convert|194.9|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}<br />Coupe: {{convert|192.5|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}\n|width={{convert|71.3|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}\n|height=1990-92 Coupe: {{convert|53.5|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}<br />Sedan: {{convert|55.1|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}<br />1993-95 Coupe: {{convert|53.7|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}\n|designer=Yusuke Saitoh (1988)<ref>{{cite web|title=Automobile|url=https://www.google.com.ar/patents/USD327239}}</ref>\n}}\n[[File:2nd Legend Coupe.JPG|thumb|left|Acura Legend coupe (US)]]\n[[File:91 Acura Legend (13174599143).jpg|thumb|left|1991 Acura Legend (US)]]\n\nSecond generation units became available October 24, 1990, now using a {{Convert|200|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} SOHC ([[Honda C engine#C32A|C32A]]) engine mated to either a standard 5-speed [[Manual transmission|manual]] or an optional 4-speed [[Automatic transmission|automatic]].

{"title_page": "History of the Serbia national football team", "text_new": "The '''history of the [[Serbia national football team]]''' began in 1920, when Serbia played its first international match.\n\n==Kingdom of Yugoslavia==\n[[File:Yugoslavia nationalteam 1930.jpg|thumb|right|250px|A Yugoslavia line-up in the [[1930 FIFA World Cup]]]]\nThe first national team was in the kingdom that existed between the two world wars. The Football Federation of what was then the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes was founded in [[Zagreb]] in 1919 under the name ''Jugoslovenski nogometni savez'' (and admitted into [[FIFA]]), and the national team played its first international game at the Summer Olympics in [[Antwerp]] in 1920. The opponent was Czechoslovakia, and the historic starting eleven that represented Kingdom of SCS on its debut were: [[Dragutin Vr\u0111uka]], [[Vjekoslav \u017dupan\u010di\u0107]], [[Jaroslav \u0160ifer]], [[Stanko Tav\u010dar]], [[Slavin Cindri\u0107]], [[Rudolf Rupec]], [[Dragutin Vragovi\u0107|Dragutin Vrag]] and Jovan Ru\u017ei\u0107. They lost by a large margin, 0\u20137, but nonetheless entered their names in the history books.\n\n===1930 World Cup===\n\nIn 1929, the country was renamed to Yugoslavia and the football association became ''Fudbalski Savez Jugoslavije'' and moved its headquarters to [[Belgrade]]. The national team participated at the [[1930 FIFA World Cup]], finishing in fourth place. In its first ever World Cup match in [[Montevideo]]'s [[Estadio Gran Parque Central|Parque Central]], Yugoslavia managed a famous 2\u20131 win versus mighty Brazil, with the following starting eleven representing the country: [[Milovan Jak\u0161i\u0107]], [[Branislav Sekuli\u0107]], [[Aleksandar Tirnani\u0107]], [[Milutin Ivkovi\u0107]], [[Ivica Bek]], [[Mom\u010dilo \u0110oki\u0107]], [[Blagoje Marjanovi\u0107]], [[Milorad Arsenijevi\u0107]], [[\u0110or\u0111e Vujadinovi\u0107]], [[Dragoslav Mihajlovi\u0107]], and [[Ljubi\u0161a Stefanovi\u0107]]. The national team consisted of players based in Serbian football clubs, while the Zagreb Subassociation forbid players from Croatian clubs to play in the World Cup due to the relocation of the football association's headquarters from Zagreb to Belgrade.<ref>[http://www.fss.rs/sr/savez/istorijat.html History] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111227044239/http://www.fss.rs/sr/savez/istorijat.html |date=2011-12-27 }} at [[Football Association of Serbia]] official website, retrieved 17-5-2913 {{in lang|sr}}</ref>\n\n==Socialist Yugoslavia==\n\nThe federation and football overall was disrupted by [[World War II]]. After the war, a socialist federation was formed and the football federation reconstituted.\n\n===Silver Medal at 1948 and 1952 Olympics===\n\nYugoslavia begin their [[Football at the 1948 Summer Olympics|football]] campaign by defeating [[Luxembourg national football team|Luxembourg]] 6\u20131, with five different players scoring the goals. In the quarter-finals and the semi-finals, they would take out [[Turkey national football team|Turkey]] and Great Britain by the same score of 3\u20131. In the final though, they would lose to [[Sweden national football team|Sweden]].\n\nHaving a team with many players from the 1948 generation, Yugoslavia was a formidable side at the [[Football at the 1952 Summer Olympics|1952 Summer Olympics]] and finished as runners-up behind the legendary [[Hungary national football team|Hungary national team]]. Against the Soviet Union, Yugoslavia was 5\u20131 up with 15 minutes of their first round match to go. The Yugoslavs, understandably, put their feet up. [[Arthur Edward Ellis|Arthur Ellis]], the match referee, recorded what happened next in his book, ''The Final Whistle'' (London, 1963): \"The USSR forced the most honourable draw ever recorded! [Vsevolod] [[Vsevolod Bobrov|Bobrov]], their captain, scored a magnificent hat-trick. After the Soviet Union had reduced the lead to 5\u20132, he, almost single-handed, took the score to 5\u20135, scoring his third in the last minute. For once, use of the word sensational was justified.\" Although Bobrov's early goal in their replay presaged a miraculous recovery, Yugoslavia recovered sufficiently to put out their opponents easily in the second half.\n\n===1960s through 1980s===\n\nYugoslavia organized the [[UEFA Euro 1976|1976 European Championship]] played in Belgrade and [[Zagreb]]. The national team participated in eight [[FIFA World Cup|World Cup]]s and four [[UEFA European Championship|Euro]]s, and won the Olympic football tournament in 1960 at the [[1960 Summer Olympics|Summer Games]] (they also finished second three times and third once).\n\n===Dissolution of Yugoslavia and UN sanctions===\nWith the end of the Cold War, democratic principles were introduced to the country which brought about the end of Titoist rule. In the subsequent atmosphere, national tensions were heightened. At the [[Yugoslavia v Netherlands (1990)|Yugoslavia-Netherlands]] friendly in preparation for the 1990 World Cup, the Croatian crowd in Zagreb jeered the Yugoslav team and anthem and waved Dutch flags (owing to its resemblance to the Croatian tricolour). With the dissolution of Yugoslavia, the team split up and the remaining team of the [[Federal Republic of Yugoslavia]] (FRY) was banned from competing at [[UEFA Euro 1992|Euro 92]]. The decision was made on 31 May 1992, just ten days before the competition commenced.<ref>[http://www.newsint-archive.co.uk/pages/S.asp?pubsel=BOTH&SrchText=denmark&DateFromDD=26&DateFromMM=May&DateFromYY=1992&DateToDD=05&DateToMM=Jun&DateToYY=1992&ResultListMax=200&head=&byline=&sect=&Caption=&edn=&page=&SortOrder=Asc&SortField=SDate&Submit1=Search&BackDD=Day&BackMM=Month&BackYY=Year&source=thetimes&SortField=Pub&SortOrder=asc&SortField=EDN&SortOrder=asc&SortField=Page&SortOrder=asc&ST=NS&SortSpec=&ResultMaxDocs=200&Site=ALL&Collection=NI&ResultCount=20&summreqd=yes&indexkey=5A7A1484131591025770&advsrch=0&QueryText=(denmark)+%3CAND%3E+(PUB%3DBOTH)+%3CAND%3E+((SDate%3E%3D5%2F26%2F1992)+%3CAND%3E+(SDate%3C%3D6%2F5%2F1992))&_P=1]{{Dead link|date=January 2020 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>\n\nThey had finished top of their qualifying group, but were unable to play in the competition due to [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 757]]. Their place was taken by [[Denmark national football team|Denmark]], who went on to win the competition. Yugoslavia had also been drawn as the top seed in [[1994 FIFA World Cup qualification (UEFA)#Group 5|Group 5 of the European Zone]] in the qualifying tournament for the [[1994 FIFA World Cup|1994 World Cup]]. FRY was barred from competing, rendering the group unusually weak.\n\n==Serbia and Montenegro==\n\n===1998 World Cup===\n\n{{see also|1998 FIFA World Cup Group F|1998 FIFA World Cup knockout stage}}\nAlthough the [[Federal Republic of Yugoslavia]], consisting of Serbia and Montenegro, was formed on 27 April 1992, its teams were banned from all international sporting events, including the national football team. Consequently, the national team did not play its first game as a new country before 23 December 1994, a friendly match played in [[Porto Alegre]] and in which [[Brazil national football team|Brazil]] won by the mark of 2\u20130. This was the first ever team composed of [[Serbs|Serbian]] and [[Montenegrins (ethnic group)|Montenegrin]] players exclusively, while [[Slobodan Santra\u010d]], a former Yugoslavia national team player, was named the team's first ever manager. The next game was played only three days later, this time in [[Buenos Aires]], resulting in 1\u20130 loss to [[Argentina national football team|Argentina]]. Despite two losses in two games, the team was honoured to play its first two games ever against such football powerhouses.\n\nAlso due to the United Nations international sanctions, the team could not participate in [[1994 FIFA World Cup qualification|1994 World Cup qualifying]] nor the [[UEFA Euro 1996 qualifying|Euro 1996 qualifying]] process.\n\nOn 31 March 1995, the team recorded its first official win in history, a 1\u20130 friendly against [[Uruguay national football team|Uruguay]], simultaneously marking the team's first ever home game, played at [[Stadion Crvena Zvezda]] in Belgrade, and the first ever goal scored, courtesy of [[Savo Milo\u0161evi\u0107]]. Slightly more than one year later, the team recorded its first ever win in a World Cup qualifying tournament in its first game in such a tournament, a 3\u20131 win over the [[Faroe Islands national football team|Faroe Islands]]. Shortly after, the team also recorded its biggest win in history, once again against the Faroe Islands, 8\u20131. Yugoslavia finished second in Group 6, just behind [[Spain national football team|Spain]], meaning it had to go through the play-off system in order to qualify. Yugoslavia was paired up with Hungary, and what was believed would be a tough matchup turned out to be an easy win for Yugoslavia, 7\u20131 in [[Budapest]] and 5\u20130 in Belgrade, for an aggregate score of 12\u20131. This was enough to secure Yugoslavia its first ever World Cup appearance as a new country.\n\nThe [[1998 FIFA World Cup seeding|1998 World Cup seeding]] had Yugoslavia ranked in 21st position, but the Yugoslavia national team went to France as one of the shadow favorites for the World Cup. ''[[The New York Times]]'' stated that Yugoslavia could easily be a semi-finalist in [[1998 FIFA World Cup|that year's World Cup]].<ref>{{cite news| url=https://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F70F16FF3D5B0C758EDDAF0894D0494D81 | work=The New York Times | first=George | last=Vecsey | title=Sports of The Times; Scrapbooks Of History For the U.S | date=26 June 1998}}</ref> The justification for such an estimation was partially found in the names of the Yugoslav players, members of great European teams and proven footballers. The draw put the team in Group F alongside [[Germany national football team|Germany]], the [[United States men's national soccer team|United States]], and [[Iran national football team|Iran]]. Yugoslavia won its first game 1\u20130 against Iran thanks to a goal from defender [[Sini\u0161a Mihajlovi\u0107]]. The next game was a draw for Yugoslavia. After leading Germany 2\u20130, last game's hero, Mihajlovi\u0107, scored an unlucky own goal following a German freekick, and [[Oliver Bierhoff]] equalised at 2\u20132 with only about ten minutes to the match. Nonetheless, Yugoslavia responded in the next game against the United States and won 1\u20130 due to an early goal in [[Nantes]]. Yugoslavia made easy work of Group 6, but despite an excellent record, the game against Germany would prove costly as Germany won the group thanks to a better goal difference.\n\nDue to their second position, Yugoslavia saw itself face the [[Netherlands national football team|Netherlands]] in the [[Round of 16]]. Yugoslavia entered in the match with a sole attacker, but its defensive tactics proved unsuccessful as [[Dennis Bergkamp]] put the Netherlands in front in the 38th minute. Immediately following the start of the second half, Yugoslavia pressured the Dutch, who inevitably conceded a header from [[Slobodan Komljenovi\u0107]]. However, the turning point of this match was a penalty awarded to Yugoslavia after [[Vladimir Jugovi\u0107]] was fouled in the penalty area. [[Predrag Mijatovi\u0107]]'s shot dazzled [[Edwin van der Sar]], but not the crossbar, and the scoreline remained the same at 1\u20131. Such an event demoralized the Yugoslavs, as the Dutch took the initiative. In the late seconds of the game, as everybody was preparing for extra time, [[Edgar Davids]]' shot towards the Yugoslav net from a distance of 20 meters and beat goalkeeper [[Ivica Kralj]], to the pure disbelief of the Yugoslav players and fans. This marked the end of Yugoslavia's run in the 1998 World Cup, since there was not much time left to do anything.\n\nUnlucky events forced Yugoslavia out of the tournament, but the team definitely demonstrated its great ability and proved it had a spot among the world's best teams. This was also reflected in the [[FIFA World Rankings]] following the 1998 FIFA World Cup, in which Yugoslavia was constantly ranked in the Top 10 for a long period of time.\n\n===Euro 2000===\n\n{{see also|UEFA Euro 2000 Group C|UEFA Euro 2000 knockout stage}}\nThe draw for the [[UEFA Euro 2000 qualifying|Euro 2000 qualifiers]] saw many eyebrows raised as first-seeded Yugoslavia was drawn in a group with [[Croatia national football team|Croatia]], thus marking the first games between the two teams after the [[Yugoslav wars|breakup of Yugoslavia]]. The other teams in the group were the [[Republic of Ireland national football team|Republic of Ireland]], [[Macedonia national football team|Macedonia]], and [[Malta national football team|Malta]]. When the qualifiers began, the coach was [[Milan \u017divadinovi\u0107]], but in July 1999 he resigned and was replaced by [[Vujadin Bo\u0161kov]].\n\nThe team started with a 1\u20130 win over Ireland in Belgrade, before beating Malta 3\u20130 in [[Ta' Qali]]. The home fixture against the Maltese followed, but was moved to [[Thessaloniki]], Greece due to the [[NATO bombing of Yugoslavia]]. The team nonetheless won 4\u20131. The first, highly anticipated match against Croatia took place in Belgrade shortly after the bombing ended, and was interrupted due to a power outage at the beginning of the second half, resuming after 43 minutes<ref>http://www.arhiva.serbia.gov.rs/news/1999-08/19/13984.html</ref> and eventually finishing 0\u20130. A 2\u20131 defeat against Ireland in [[Dublin]] was followed by victories home and away against Macedonia (3\u20131 and 4\u20132 respectively), meaning that Yugoslavia needed to win its final qualifier against Croatia in Zagreb, or to draw with Ireland failing to beat Macedonia in [[Skopje]], in order to qualify automatically for Euro 2000. In the event, Ireland conceded an injury-time equaliser, meaning that Yugoslavia's 2\u20132 draw with the Croatians was good enough.\n\nThe draw for the finals placed Yugoslavia in Group C along with Spain, [[Norway national football team|Norway]] and another former Yugoslav republic, [[Slovenia national football team|Slovenia]]. The Slovenians took a surprise 3\u20130 lead in the first game at the [[Stade du Pays de Charleroi]], but three goals in six second-half minutes enabled Yugoslavia to secure a 3\u20133 draw. The team then beat Norway 1\u20130 in [[Li\u00e8ge (city)|Li\u00e8ge]], thanks to an early [[Savo Milo\u0161evi\u0107]] backheel strike. The final group game, against Spain in [[Bruges]], saw the Yugoslavs take the lead three times, before a [[Gaizka Mendieta]] penalty and an [[Alfonso P\u00e9rez|Alfonso]] strike in injury-time secured a dramatic 4\u20133 win for the Spaniards and top spot in the group. Yugoslavia nonetheless finished second, level on points with Norway but ranked ahead due to its victory in Li\u00e8ge. In each of the three games, the team had one player sent off ([[Sini\u0161a Mihajlovi\u0107]], [[Mateja Ke\u017eman]], and [[Slavi\u0161a Jokanovi\u0107]], respectively).\n\nIn the quarter-finals, Yugoslavia was once again paired with the Netherlands. Unlike the last time, the co-hosts made easy work of Yugoslavia, winning 6\u20131 in [[Rotterdam]] with [[Patrick Kluivert]] scoring a hat-trick.\n\nOne of the few bright spots of Yugoslav team in the whole tournament was [[Savo Milo\u0161evi\u0107]], who was crowned the joint top scorer of the tournament, alongside Patrick Kluivert. Both players scored five goals, although Milo\u0161evi\u0107 played one game fewer.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.euro2000.org/en/tournament/page4/0,1074,,00.html | title=Leading goalscorers | work=UEFA.com | publisher=Union of European Football Associations | date=2 July 2000 | accessdate=12 July 2012 | archiveurl=http://web.archive.bibalex.org/web/20000711003231/www.euro2000.org/en/tournament/page4/0,1074,,00.html | archivedate=11 July 2000 }}</ref>\n\n===2002 World Cup campaign===\n\nThe [[2002 FIFA World Cup qualification|2002 qualifiers]] marked the first time that Yugoslavia failed to reach a major tournament ever since its return to the big stage after the UN sanctions. The problems started with the major political turmoil in the country as well in the Yugoslav FA, which prompted the new coach [[Ilija Petkovi\u0107]] to resign only after one game (2\u20130 away victory against [[Luxembourg national football team|Luxembourg]]).\n\n[[Milovan \u0110ori\u0107]] took over the team, but under his leadership, the team managed only two draws (1\u20131 at home vs. [[Switzerland national football team|Switzerland]] and also 1\u20131 away in Slovenia, in both games the opponents managed to equalise in late stages of the game) and a 0\u20131 home loss to [[Russia national football team|Russia]] (which marked the team's first home defeat in official matches). After \u00d0ori\u0107's resignation, a three-man commission, consisting of [[Dejan Savi\u0107evi\u0107]], [[Vujadin Bo\u0161kov]], and [[Ivan \u0106urkovi\u0107]], took over the coaching duties, until Savi\u0107evi\u0107 ultimately took over on his own. The team managed to bounce back with a draw in Russia and a win in Switzerland, but failed to defeat Slovenia in the penultimate game, thus ended the qualifiers in third position.\n\n===2006 World Cup===\n\n{{see also|2006 FIFA World Cup Group C}}\n[[File:Elfenbeink\u00fcste - Serbien und Montenegro.jpg|left|thumb|200px|[[Serbia and Montenegro]] and [[Cote d'Ivoire]] playing in the [[Allianz Arena]] at the 2006 FIFA World Cup]]\n[[File:SCG-BiH 1-0 wc2006 qual Marakana Oct12 2005 Bijeljina.jpg|right|thumb|200px|Serbia and Montenegro against [[Bosnia and Herzegovina national football team|Bosnia and Herzegovina]] in qualifiers for [[2006 FIFA World Cup|2006 World Cup]]]]\nAfter Savi\u0107evi\u0107's disastrous spell as coach of Yugoslavia, the country went under a [[Constitutional Charter of Serbia and Montenegro|political transformation]], and [[Ilija Petkovi\u0107]] became the newly named Serbia and Montenegro's new coach. Initially, the team under his lead experienced dragging failure in the [[UEFA Euro 2004 qualifying|Euro 2004 qualifiers]] while competing for the first time as Serbia and Montenegro. Despite drawing both games against group favorites and eventual group winners [[Italy national football team|Italy]] and winning both games against runners-up [[Wales national football team|Wales]], Serbia and Montenegro failed to qualify, mostly due to an embarrassing 2\u20132 home draw and 2\u20131 away loss to [[Azerbaijan national football team|Azerbaijan]].\n\nQualifying for the [[2006 FIFA World Cup|2006 World Cup]], however, was different. Serbia and Montenegro began the campaign by finishing first with an undefeated record in their [[2006 FIFA World Cup qualification|qualification]] group ahead of favourites Spain. The Serbia and Montenegro team also allowed only one goal in the ten matches, the best defensive record of all 51 teams participating in qualification.\n\nFor the 2006 qualifiers, Serbia and Montenegro was drawn in a group with Spain, [[Belgium national football team|Belgium]], [[Bosnia and Herzegovina national football team|Bosnia and Herzegovina]], [[Lithuania national football team|Lithuania]] and [[San Marino national football team|San Marino]]. Led once again by [[Ilija Petkovi\u0107]] as coach, Serbia and Montenegro played some impressive defensive football\u2014the \"Famous Four\" defense, consisting of [[Nemanja Vidi\u0107]], [[Mladen Krstaji\u0107]], [[Goran Gavran\u010di\u0107]], and [[Ivica Dragutinovi\u0107]], with [[Dragoslav Jevri\u0107]] as goalkeeper, conceded only one goal in ten games, finishing first with a 6\u20134\u20130 record, ahead of Spain.\n\nOn 3 June 2006, following a [[Montenegrin independence referendum, 2006|referendum]], Montenegro declared its independence from Serbia. As the World Cup was about to start, it was decided that the Serbia and Montenegro team that had qualified for the tournament would compete, with the split into separate teams representing the new countries of Montenegro and Serbia to take place once the team was no longer in the tournament.\n\nIn the [[2006 FIFA World Cup|group stage]], Serbia and Montenegro lost their opening game to joint group favourite, the Netherlands. The final score was 1\u20130 after [[Arjen Robben]] scored the only goal of the game. They also lost their second game to Argentina 6\u20130, [[Serbia and Montenegro]]'s worst ever international result. With the team's two losses and with Netherlands and Argentina winning both their games, Serbia and Montenegro could no longer qualify for the knockout matches, and was playing for pride alone in their final group game against [[Ivory Coast national football team|Ivory Coast]]. Despite having a 2\u20130 lead for much of the first half, ''the Elephants'' managed to come back and win 3\u20132, leaving Serbia and Montenegro with a disappointing 0\u20130\u20133 World Cup run.\n\n==Serbia==\nAfter [[Montenegrin independence referendum, 2006|Montenegro declared independence]], Serbia marked independence with a 3\u20131 away victory over the [[Czech Republic national football team|Czech Republic]]. [[Danko Lazovi\u0107]]'s, [[Marko Panteli\u0107]]'s and [[Aleksandar Tri\u0161ovi\u0107]]'s goals led Serbia to victory on this match.\n\n===UEFA Euro 2008 qualifying===\n\n[[File:Srbija-Belgija-7.10.2006.JPG|right|thumb|200px|[[Serbia national football team|Serbia]] against [[Belgium national football team|Belgium]], on 7 October 2006]]\n\nThe [[UEFA Euro 2008 qualifying Group C|2008 UEFA European Football Championship qualifying campaign]] began with a 1\u20130 victory over [[Azerbaijan national football team|Azerbaijan]] by [[Nikola \u017digi\u0107]]'s goal in the 72nd minute on 6 September 2006. Four days later, Serbia drew with [[Poland national football team|Poland]] 1\u20131. Serbia made a two victories in October: 1\u20130 over [[Belgium national football team|Belgium]] and 3\u20130 over [[Armenia national football team|Armenia]]. In 6 matches, Serbia stayed undefeated in 2006 (4 victories, 2 draws). In the first qualifying match in 2007, Serbia unexpectedly lost 1\u20132 from [[Kazakhstan national football team|Kazakhstan]] in [[Almaty]], and four days later (28 March 2007) made a draw in front of 52,000 fans at [[Rajko Miti\u0107 Stadium]] against [[Portugal national football team|Portugal]]. On 2 June 2007, Serbia made a 2\u20130 victory over [[Finland national football team|Finland]] in [[Helsinki]]. In August, he lost from Belgium 2\u20133 away, [[Zdravko Kuzmanovi\u0107]] scored (his first) two goals. After a three draws, Serbia demolished Azerbaijan with 6\u20131 in [[Baku]]. On 21 November 2007, Serbia draw 2\u20132 at home with Poland in the front of 3,000 fans. Three days later, with a low attendance (less than 1,000) at [[Partizan Stadium]], Serbia defeated Kazakhstan by own goal in the 79th minute in the last match of this qualifying cycle. Serbia finished third, three points behind runners-up [[Portugal national football team|Portugal]] and Group A winners [[Poland national football team|Poland]]. Serbia's first ever foreign coach [[Javier Clemente]] was sacked after the failure.\n\n===Golden years (2008\u20132010)===\n\n[[File:Serbia soccer vs france.jpg|right|thumb|200px|Atmosphere at the start of match vs. France, 9 September 2009]]\n\nSerbia replaced Clemente with [[Miroslav \u0110uki\u0107]], but he left the position on 19 August of the following year without having played any official games. Subsequent to \u00d0uki\u0107's rapid departure, who led Serbia on five friendly matches and made three defeats and two draws, [[Radomir Anti\u0107]] was appointed coach. Serbia's [[2010 FIFA World Cup qualification \u2013 UEFA Group 7|World Cup qualification campaign]] began on 6 September 2008. Serbia defeated [[Faroe Islands national football team|Faroe Islands]], by own goal in 30th minute and Nikola \u017digi\u0107's goal in 88th minute. Four days later, Serbia lost from [[2006 FIFA World Cup]] runners-up [[France national football team|France]] 1\u20132 on [[Stade de France]]. A month later, Serbia defeated [[Lithuania national football team|Lithuania]] 3\u20130 with the goals scored by [[Branislav Ivanovi\u0107]] [[Milo\u0161 Krasi\u0107]] and Nikola \u017digi\u0107. On 15 October 2008,\nSerbia broken [[Austria national football team|Austria]] 3\u20131 in [[Vienna]] in the front of 48,000 fans. Krasi\u0107, [[Milan Jovanovi\u0107 (footballer born 1981)|Milan Jovanovi\u0107]] and [[Ivan Obradovi\u0107]] scored goals for 9 minutes (15th, 18th and 24th). By the end of the year, Serbia played one match in November and one in December. First, in November, Serbia demolish [[Bulgaria national football team|Bulgaria]] 6\u20131 in Belgrade. [[Savo Milo\u0161evi\u0107]], the second top goalscorer of all time in Serbia national team, scored twice and missed two penalties in his last match for national team. Serbia lost against Poland in [[Antalya]], in December 0\u20131. In first match in 2009, Serbia made a huge victory over [[Romania national football team|Romania]] in [[Constan\u0163a]]. Romania not defeated in Constan\u0163a seven years, before this match. On 6 June 2009, Serbia defeated Austria 1\u20130 in the front of 52,000 fans at Rajko Miti\u0107 Stadium. [[Nenad Milija\u0161]] scored the only goal, in 7th minute, from ''penalty spot''. Four days later, Serbia made an expected victory (2\u20130) over Faroe Islands in [[T\u00f3rshavn]]. On 9 September 2009, Serbia draw 1\u20131 with world runners-up, France in the front of almost 50,000 fans. Nenad Milija\u0161 scored the only goal for ''Eagles'', in 12th minute, from ''penalty spot'', like against Austria three monts before. On 10 October 2009, Serbia made a huge victory 5\u20130 against Romania and secured placement at [[2010 FIFA World Cup]]. In last match of this qualifying cycle, Lithuania defeated Serbia 2\u20131 in [[Marijampol\u0117]]. In November, Serbia defeat [[Northern Ireland national football team|Northern Ireland]] and [[South Korea national football team|South Korea]] in [[Belfast]] and [[London]], 1\u20130 both matches.\n\n[[File:FIFA World Cup 2010 Serbia Ghana.jpg|left|thumb|200px|Serbia vs. Ghana, 13 June 2010]]\nSerbia placed into Group D with [[Germany national football team|Germany]], team also faced [[2010 Africa Cup of Nations]] runners-up [[Ghana national football team|Ghana]], and [[Australia national football team|Australia]].\n\nTheir opening group game was against Ghana and chances came to both sides but a red card to [[Aleksandar Lukovi\u0107]] and a handball by substitute Zdravko Kuzmanovi\u0107 in the second half gave [[Ghana national football team|Ghana]] a penalty to take all three points at the death. [[Asamoah Gyan]] converted eight minutes from full-time and Serbia were defeated 1\u20130. In Serbia's second group match, they sensationally defeated Germany by a score of 1\u20130 with an acrobatic goal by Milan Jovanovi\u0107 late in the first half. [[FIFA]]'s official YouTube channel called the win \"the most famous day in Serbia's footballing history\". Serbia only needed a single point to reach the knockout stages but were defeated by Australia 2\u20131 in an entertaining match where Serbia's dominance in the first half and in periods of the second half would have made it look like a Serbia victory. Australia scored 2 goals in the second half through [[Tim Cahill]] and [[Brett Holman]]. A late [[Marko Panteli\u0107]] goal served only as a consolation. They finished last in the group.\n\n===Disappointing qualifications (2011\u20132016)===\n\nAfter game against Australia and elimination from World Cup, Serbia start [[UEFA Euro 2012 qualifying|2012 UEFA European Football Championship qualifying campaign]]. The qualifying stage began with Radomir Anti\u0107 as coach and finished with [[Vladimir Petrovi\u0107]]. Serbia and Anti\u0107 started the first two games positively with a 3\u20130 win away to Faroe Islands and a 1\u20131 draw at home to Slovenia but this result brought the end of Anti\u0107's reign as the country's coach. New coach Petrovi\u0107 faced setbacks immediately with an embarrassing 3\u20131 loss at home to [[Estonia national football team|Estonia]] and an abandoned match resulting in a 3\u20130 loss to [[Italy national football team|Italy]] due to crowd trouble from the Serbian away supporters in [[Genoa]]. Serbia returned to form with a 2\u20131 win at home over [[Northern Ireland national football team|Northern Ireland]] but could only manage a 1\u20131 draw away to Estonia. Afterwards, Serbia won back to back games with a 1\u20130 win away to Northern Ireland and a crucial 3\u20131 win at home against Faroe Islands. These results put Serbia in pole position to confirm a play-off spot behind Italy. Serbia needed a win at home against Italy to confirm a play-off spot but their efforts only resulted in a 1\u20131 draw. The team, however, still had one more chance to confirm a play-off place when they faced Slovenia away. This game was a must win even though Serbia had a superior goal difference over Estonia, a draw was not good enough for progression. Serbia played positively and created a number of chances during the game but a long-range goal put Slovenia up 1\u20130 at half time. The Serbians then failed to convert numerous chances that they had in the second half, notably [[Nemanja Vidi\u0107]]'s penalty miss midway through the second half. Serbia left empty handed after a 1\u20130 loss and exited the tournament for the third time in a row during the qualifying group stages, missing out by one point behind Estonia. Vladimir Petrovi\u0107 was sacked after the team's failure to qualify.\n\n[[File:Serbia vs Belgium 2012.jpg|right|thumb|200px|Serbia vs. Belgium,]]\n[[Dejan Stankovi\u0107]] and Nemanja Vidi\u0107 announced that they were retiring from international football. This meant that Serbia had lost two key players and that a new era had started. Branislav Ivanovi\u0107 became the new captain. [[Sini\u0161a Mihajlovi\u0107]], a former member of the national team, was appointed as the coach on 24 April 2012. Serbia was drawn in [[2014 FIFA World Cup qualification&nbsp;\u2013 UEFA Group 1|Group A]] in [[2014 FIFA World Cup qualification|qualification]] for [[2014 FIFA World Cup]], together with [[Croatia national football team|Croatia]], [[Belgium national football team|Belgium]], [[Scotland national football team|Scotland]], [[Macedonia national football team|Macedonia]], and [[Wales national football team|Wales]]. The team began the qualification campaign with a goalless draw with Scotland in [[Glasgow]] and a 6\u20131 win over Wales in [[Novi Sad]]. In the next two games, Serbia suffered two defeats, from [[Macedonia national football team|Macedonia]] in (0\u20131) and Belgium in Belgrade (0\u20133). In 2013, on 22 March, Serbia played in [[Zagreb]] against [[Croatia national football team|Croatia]]. The game was highly anticipated in both countries due to their rivalry both on and off the pitch. Croatia won 2\u20130 and sent Serbia down on the table. Serbia then defeated Scotland 2\u20130 at home in a crucial qualifier, though their World Cup hopes were taken away after a 2\u20131 defeat to Belgium. Serbia drew with Croatia 1\u20131 in the corresponding fixture at home in a spiteful affair, where 18-year-old [[Aleksandar Mitrovi\u0107 (footballer)|Aleksandar Mitrovi\u0107]] scored an equalizer in the second-half after [[Mario Mand\u017euki\u0107]] opened the scoring. They then defeated Wales 0\u20133 in Cardiff. Dejan Stankovi\u0107's farewell game was completed in a friendly against [[Japan national football team|Japan]], which Serbia won 2\u20130. He finished his career with 103 appearances for the national team, a record previously held by [[Savo Milo\u0161evi\u0107]], with 102 appearances. Serbia finished qualifying with a 5\u20131 home win against Macedonia, putting them in third in the group, three points from a playoff spot behind Croatia and group winners Belgium.\n\nDutch [[Dick Advocaat]] was appointed as the coach in July 2014. Serbia was drawn in [[UEFA Euro 2016 qualifying Group I|Group I]] in [[UEFA Euro 2016 qualifying|qualification]] for [[UEFA Euro 2016]], together with [[Portugal national football team|Portugal]], [[Denmark national football team|Denmark]], [[Albania national football team|Albania]] and [[Armenia national football team|Armenia]]. Advocaat started with a draw in a friendly 1\u20131 game against [[France national football team|France]]. The team began qualification with a 1\u20131 draw against Armenia in [[Yerevan]]. In the next abandoned game against Albania in Belgrade, Serbia was originally awarded with a 3\u20130 victory, but was later deducted three points. On 14 November 2014, Serbia played against Denmark in Belgrade and lost, 1\u20133. After this game, Advocaat left, whereupon [[Radovan \u0106ur\u010di\u0107]] was announced as a new coach on 18 November. In 2015, Serbia's first match was a qualifying match against Portugal in [[Lisbon]], during which Serbia lost 2\u20131, cutting their chances for qualification to Euro 2016. On 13 June 2015, Serbia played a qualifying match against Denmark in [[Copenhagen]], losing 2\u20130. On 10 July, the [[Court of Arbitration for Sport]] (CAS) announced that it had awarded a 0\u20133 victory to Albania in the abandoned match held on 14 October 2014, upholding Serbia's three-point penalization. As a result, Serbia became mathematically eliminated from Euro 2016 qualification. On 4 September 2015, Serbia reached first victory in these qualifications, 2\u20130 over Armenia. On 8 October, Serbia made a huge victory over rival Albania in [[Elbasan]]. [[Aleksandar Kolarov]]'s and [[Adem Ljaji\u0107]]'s goals in 91st and 94th minute led Serbia to the victory. In the table of [[UEFA Euro 2016 qualifying Group I|Group I]], Serbia finished second to last place with four points in a five team group.\n\n===The return===\n[[File:Srbija - Gruzija KV SP 2018.jpg|340px|thumb|right|Serbia - Georgia 1\u20130, World Cup 2018 qualification match at [[Red Star Stadium]]]]\n\nIn first match for [[2018 FIFA World Cup qualification (UEFA)|2018 FIFA World Cup qualification]], Serbia started off their campaign with a 2\u20132 draw against Ireland at the Rajko Mitic Stadium. [[Republic of Ireland national football team|Republic of Ireland]] take the lead in 3rd minute. The Eagles equalized by [[Filip Kosti\u0107]]'s goal in 62nd minute and seven minutes later take the lead after [[Du\u0161an Tadi\u0107]] successfully completed the penalty. Conceded goal in 80th minute has costed Serbia three points. One month later, Serbia made a first victory, over [[Moldova national football team|Moldova]] in [[Chi\u0219in\u0103u]]. Filip Kosti\u0107 scored first goal on the match again, this time in 19th minute. Captain [[Branislav Ivanovi\u0107]] scored in 37th minute. Du\u0161an Tadi\u0107 scored in 59th minute and with one goal and two assists helped Serbia to beat Moldova 3\u20130. Three days later, on 9 October 2016, Serbia defeated Austria (3\u20132) at Rajko Miti\u0107 Stadium and made very important victory. Brace from [[Aleksandar Mitrovi\u0107 (footballer)|Aleksandar Mitrovi\u0107]] in 6th and 23rd minute and Du\u0161an Tadi\u0107's in 74th minute masterpiece helped Serbia to win the match. On 12 November 2016, Aleksandar Mitrovi\u0107's goal in 86th minute, helped Serbia to take a point against Euro 2016 semi-finalists, [[Wales national football team|Wales]] in [[Cardiff]]. On 24 March, in first match in 2017, Serbia defeat 3\u20131 [[Georgia national football team|Georgia]] in [[Tbilisi]]. Du\u0161an Tadi\u0107 scored the equalizer, from ''penalty spot'' in 44th minute. Aleksandar Mitrovi\u0107 with beautiful goal give Serbia lead in 64th minute. [[Mijat Ga\u0107inovi\u0107]] replaced Filip Kosti\u0107 81st minute, and scored a goal five minutes later in his first game for national team. On 11 June 2017, Aleksandar Mitrovi\u0107 scored the only goal for Eagles, against Wales (1\u20131) in the front of 47,000 fans at Rajko Miti\u0107 Stadium. On 2 September 2017, Serbia defeated Moldova 3\u20130 at [[Partizan Stadium]]. Mijat Ga\u0107inovi\u0107 scored 20th minute and ten minutes later assisted for [[Aleksandar Kolarov]]'s first goal in these qualifications. Aleksandar Mitrovi\u0107 scored the third goal for Serbia on this match and continued his amazing performance in these qualifications (six goals in last five qualification matches). Three days later, Serbia defeated Ireland in [[Dublin]] 1\u20130 and come on the step of [[2018 FIFA World Cup]]. Aleksandar Kolarov scored a goal in 55th minute. [[Nikola Maksimovi\u0107]] was sent off thirteen minutes later and Eagles played almost half an hour with a player less. Serbia needed a victory on one of two remaining matches. On 6 October, at [[Ernst-Happel-Stadion]] in [[Wien]] Serbia has lost 3\u20132. The Eagles take the lead in 11th minute, after [[Luka Milivojevi\u0107]]'s first goal for national team, but Austria reversed result in 76th minute, but [[Nemanja Mati\u0107]] has scored the equalizer seven minutes later. In 89th minute, Austrians scored the winning goal. Three days later at Rajko Miti\u0107 Stadium, [[Aleksandar Prijovi\u0107]]'s goal in 74th minute against Georgia sent Serbia to the 2018 FIFA World Cup. A couple days after match, coach [[Slavoljub Muslin]] was sacked. [[Mladen Krstaji\u0107]] succeeded Muslin as coach of the Serbia national team, initially as a caretaker. He led team on two matches in November. In first match, he made victory against [[China national football team|China]] 2\u20130, but in second Serbia draw 1\u20131 with [[South Korea national football team|South Korea]]. In December, it was announced he would take on the role permanently and at least until the end of the [[2018 FIFA World Cup]]. In March, Serbia played two matches against two strongest African teams. In first match, in [[Turin]], Serbia lost 1\u20132 against [[Morocco national football team|Morocco]]. Du\u0161an Tadi\u0107 scored goal for Serbia, in his 50th match for national team. On 27 March, Serbia beat 2\u20130 [[Nigeria national football team|Nigeria]] in [[London]]. Mitrovi\u0107 scored two goals for Serbia.

The Football Federation of what was then the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes was founded in [[Zagreb]] in 1919 under the name ''Jugoslovenski nogometni savez'' (and admitted into [[FIFA]]), and the national team played its first international game at the Summer Olympics in [[Antwerp]] in 1920. The opponent was Czechoslovakia, and the historic starting eleven that represented Kingdom of SCS on its debut were: [[Dragutin Vr\u0111uka]], [[Vjekoslav \u017dupan\u010di\u0107]], [[Jaroslav \u0160ifer]], [[Stanko Tav\u010dar]], [[Slavin Cindri\u0107]], [[Rudolf Rupec]], [[Dragutin Vragovi\u0107|Dragutin Vrag]] and Jovan Ru\u017ei\u0107. They lost by a large margin, 0\u20137, but nonetheless entered their names in the history books.\n\n===1930 World Cup===\n\nIn 1929, the country was renamed to Yugoslavia and the football association became ''Fudbalski Savez Jugoslavije'' and moved its headquarters to [[Belgrade]]. The national team participated at the [[1930 FIFA World Cup]], finishing in fourth place. In its first ever World Cup match in [[Montevideo]]'s [[Estadio Gran Parque Central|Parque Central]], Yugoslavia managed a famous 2\u20131 win versus mighty Brazil, with the following starting eleven representing the country: [[Milovan Jak\u0161i\u0107]], [[Branislav Sekuli\u0107]], [[Aleksandar Tirnani\u0107]], [[Milutin Ivkovi\u0107]], [[Ivica Bek]], [[Mom\u010dilo \u0110oki\u0107]], [[Blagoje Marjanovi\u0107]], [[Milorad Arsenijevi\u0107]], [[\u0110or\u0111e Vujadinovi\u0107]], [[Dragoslav Mihajlovi\u0107]], and [[Ljubi\u0161a Stefanovi\u0107]]. The national team consisted of players based in Serbian football clubs, while the Zagreb Subassociation forbid players from Croatian clubs to play in the World Cup due to the relocation of the football association's headquarters from Zagreb to Belgrade.<ref>[http://www.fss.rs/sr/savez/istorijat.html History] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111227044239/http://www.fss.rs/sr/savez/istorijat.html |date=2011-12-27 }} at [[Football Association of Serbia]] official website, retrieved 17-5-2913 {{in lang|sr}}</ref>\n\n==Socialist Yugoslavia==\n\nThe federation and football overall was disrupted by [[World War II]]. After the war, a socialist federation was formed and the football federation reconstituted.\n\n===Silver Medal at 1948 and 1952 Olympics===\n\nYugoslavia begin their [[Football at the 1948 Summer Olympics|football]] campaign by defeating [[Luxembourg national football team|Luxembourg]] 6\u20131, with five different players scoring the goals. In the quarter-finals and the semi-finals, they would take out [[Turkey national football team|Turkey]] and Great Britain by the same score of 3\u20131. In the final though, they would lose to [[Sweden national football team|Sweden]].\n\nHaving a team with many players from the 1948 generation, Yugoslavia was a formidable side at the [[Football at the 1952 Summer Olympics|1952 Summer Olympics]] and finished as runners-up behind the legendary [[Hungary national football team|Hungary national team]]. Against the Soviet Union, Yugoslavia was 5\u20131 up with 15 minutes of their first round match to go. The Yugoslavs, understandably, put their feet up. [[Arthur Edward Ellis|Arthur Ellis]], the match referee, recorded what happened next in his book, ''The Final Whistle'' (London, 1963): \"The USSR forced the most honourable draw ever recorded! [Vsevolod] [[Vsevolod Bobrov|Bobrov]], their captain, scored a magnificent hat-trick. After the Soviet Union had reduced the lead to 5\u20132, he, almost single-handed, took the score to 5\u20135, scoring his third in the last minute. For once, use of the word sensational was justified.\" Although Bobrov's early goal in their replay presaged a miraculous recovery, Yugoslavia recovered sufficiently to put out their opponents easily in the second half.\n\n===1960s through 1980s===\n\nYugoslavia organized the [[UEFA Euro 1976|1976 European Championship]] played in Belgrade and [[Zagreb]]. The national team participated in eight [[FIFA World Cup|World Cup]]s and four [[UEFA European Championship|Euro]]s, and won the Olympic football tournament in 1960 at the [[1960 Summer Olympics|Summer Games]] (they also finished second three times and third once).\n\n===Dissolution of Yugoslavia and UN sanctions===\nWith the end of the Cold War, democratic principles were introduced to the country which brought about the end of Titoist rule. In the subsequent atmosphere, national tensions were heightened. At the [[Yugoslavia v Netherlands (1990)|Yugoslavia-Netherlands]] friendly in preparation for the 1990 World Cup, the Croatian crowd in Zagreb jeered the Yugoslav team and anthem and waved Dutch flags (owing to its resemblance to the Croatian tricolour). With the dissolution of Yugoslavia, the team split up and the remaining team of the [[Federal Republic of Yugoslavia]] (FRY) was banned from competing at [[UEFA Euro 1992|Euro 92]]. The decision was made on 31 May 1992, just ten days before the competition commenced.<ref>[http://www.newsint-archive.co.uk/pages/S.asp?pubsel=BOTH&SrchText=denmark&DateFromDD=26&DateFromMM=May&DateFromYY=1992&DateToDD=05&DateToMM=Jun&DateToYY=1992&ResultListMax=200&head=&byline=&sect=&Caption=&edn=&page=&SortOrder=Asc&SortField=SDate&Submit1=Search&BackDD=Day&BackMM=Month&BackYY=Year&source=thetimes&SortField=Pub&SortOrder=asc&SortField=EDN&SortOrder=asc&SortField=Page&SortOrder=asc&ST=NS&SortSpec=&ResultMaxDocs=200&Site=ALL&Collection=NI&ResultCount=20&summreqd=yes&indexkey=5A7A1484131591025770&advsrch=0&QueryText=(denmark)+%3CAND%3E+(PUB%3DBOTH)+%3CAND%3E+((SDate%3E%3D5%2F26%2F1992)+%3CAND%3E+(SDate%3C%3D6%2F5%2F1992))&_P=1]{{Dead link|date=January 2020 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>\n\nThey had finished top of their qualifying group, but were unable to play in the competition due to [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 757]]. Their place was taken by [[Denmark national football team|Denmark]], who went on to win the competition. Yugoslavia had also been drawn as the top seed in [[1994 FIFA World Cup qualification (UEFA)#Group 5|Group 5 of the European Zone]] in the qualifying tournament for the [[1994 FIFA World Cup|1994 World Cup]]. FRY was barred from competing, rendering the group unusually weak.\n\n==Serbia and Montenegro==\n\n===1998 World Cup===\n\n{{see also|1998 FIFA World Cup Group F|1998 FIFA World Cup knockout stage}}\nAlthough the [[Federal Republic of Yugoslavia]], consisting of Serbia and Montenegro, was formed on 27 April 1992, its teams were banned from all international sporting events, including the national football team. Consequently, the national team did not play its first game as a new country before 23 December 1994, a friendly match played in [[Porto Alegre]] and in which [[Brazil national football team|Brazil]] won by the mark of 2\u20130. This was the first ever team composed of [[Serbs|Serbian]] and [[Montenegrins (ethnic group)|Montenegrin]] players exclusively, while [[Slobodan Santra\u010d]], a former Yugoslavia national team player, was named the team's first ever manager. The next game was played only three days later, this time in [[Buenos Aires]], resulting in 1\u20130 loss to [[Argentina national football team|Argentina]]. Despite two losses in two games, the team was honoured to play its first two games ever against such football powerhouses.\n\nAlso due to the United Nations international sanctions, the team could not participate in [[1994 FIFA World Cup qualification|1994 World Cup qualifying]] nor the [[UEFA Euro 1996 qualifying|Euro 1996 qualifying]] process.\n\nOn 31 March 1995, the team recorded its first official win in history, a 1\u20130 friendly against [[Uruguay national football team|Uruguay]], simultaneously marking the team's first ever home game, played at [[Stadion Crvena Zvezda]] in Belgrade, and the first ever goal scored, courtesy of [[Savo Milo\u0161evi\u0107]]. Slightly more than one year later, the team recorded its first ever win in a World Cup qualifying tournament in its first game in such a tournament, a 3\u20131 win over the [[Faroe Islands national football team|Faroe Islands]]. Shortly after, the team also recorded its biggest win in history, once again against the Faroe Islands, 8\u20131. Yugoslavia finished second in Group 6, just behind [[Spain national football team|Spain]], meaning it had to go through the play-off system in order to qualify. Yugoslavia was paired up with Hungary, and what was believed would be a tough matchup turned out to be an easy win for Yugoslavia, 7\u20131 in [[Budapest]] and 5\u20130 in Belgrade, for an aggregate score of 12\u20131. This was enough to secure Yugoslavia its first ever World Cup appearance as a new country.\n\nThe [[1998 FIFA World Cup seeding|1998 World Cup seeding]] had Yugoslavia ranked in 21st position, but the Yugoslavia national team went to France as one of the shadow favorites for the World Cup. ''[[The New York Times]]'' stated that Yugoslavia could easily be a semi-finalist in [[1998 FIFA World Cup|that year's World Cup]].<ref>{{cite news| url=https://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F70F16FF3D5B0C758EDDAF0894D0494D81 | work=The New York Times | first=George | last=Vecsey | title=Sports of The Times; Scrapbooks Of History For the U.S | date=26 June 1998}}</ref> The justification for such an estimation was partially found in the names of the Yugoslav players, members of great European teams and proven footballers. The draw put the team in Group F alongside [[Germany national football team|Germany]], the [[United States men's national soccer team|United States]], and [[Iran national football team|Iran]]. Yugoslavia won its first game 1\u20130 against Iran thanks to a goal from defender [[Sini\u0161a Mihajlovi\u0107]]. The next game was a draw for Yugoslavia. After leading Germany 2\u20130, last game's hero, Mihajlovi\u0107, scored an unlucky own goal following a German freekick, and [[Oliver Bierhoff]] equalised at 2\u20132 with only about ten minutes to the match. Nonetheless, Yugoslavia responded in the next game against the United States and won 1\u20130 due to an early goal in [[Nantes]]. Yugoslavia made easy work of Group 6, but despite an excellent record, the game against Germany would prove costly as Germany won the group thanks to a better goal difference.\n\nDue to their second position, Yugoslavia saw itself face the [[Netherlands national football team|Netherlands]] in the [[Round of 16]]. Yugoslavia entered in the match with a sole attacker, but its defensive tactics proved unsuccessful as [[Dennis Bergkamp]] put the Netherlands in front in the 38th minute. Immediately following the start of the second half, Yugoslavia pressured the Dutch, who inevitably conceded a header from [[Slobodan Komljenovi\u0107]]. However, the turning point of this match was a penalty awarded to Yugoslavia after [[Vladimir Jugovi\u0107]] was fouled in the penalty area. [[Predrag Mijatovi\u0107]]'s shot dazzled [[Edwin van der Sar]], but not the crossbar, and the scoreline remained the same at 1\u20131. Such an event demoralized the Yugoslavs, as the Dutch took the initiative. In the late seconds of the game, as everybody was preparing for extra time, [[Edgar Davids]]' shot towards the Yugoslav net from a distance of 20 meters and beat goalkeeper [[Ivica Kralj]], to the pure disbelief of the Yugoslav players and fans. This marked the end of Yugoslavia's run in the 1998 World Cup, since there was not much time left to do anything.\n\nUnlucky events forced Yugoslavia out of the tournament, but the team definitely demonstrated its great ability and proved it had a spot among the world's best teams. This was also reflected in the [[FIFA World Rankings]] following the 1998 FIFA World Cup, in which Yugoslavia was constantly ranked in the Top 10 for a long period of time.\n\n===Euro 2000===\n\n{{see also|UEFA Euro 2000 Group C|UEFA Euro 2000 knockout stage}}\nThe draw for the [[UEFA Euro 2000 qualifying|Euro 2000 qualifiers]] saw many eyebrows raised as first-seeded Yugoslavia was drawn in a group with [[Croatia national football team|Croatia]], thus marking the first games between the two teams after the [[Yugoslav wars|breakup of Yugoslavia]]. The other teams in the group were the [[Republic of Ireland national football team|Republic of Ireland]], [[Macedonia national football team|Macedonia]], and [[Malta national football team|Malta]]. When the qualifiers began, the coach was [[Milan \u017divadinovi\u0107]], but in July 1999 he resigned and was replaced by [[Vujadin Bo\u0161kov]].\n\nThe team started with a 1\u20130 win over Ireland in Belgrade, before beating Malta 3\u20130 in [[Ta' Qali]]. The home fixture against the Maltese followed, but was moved to [[Thessaloniki]], Greece due to the [[NATO bombing of Yugoslavia]]. The team nonetheless won 4\u20131. The first, highly anticipated match against Croatia took place in Belgrade shortly after the bombing ended, and was interrupted due to a power outage at the beginning of the second half, resuming after 43 minutes<ref>http://www.arhiva.serbia.gov.rs/news/1999-08/19/13984.html</ref> and eventually finishing 0\u20130. A 2\u20131 defeat against Ireland in [[Dublin]] was followed by victories home and away against Macedonia (3\u20131 and 4\u20132 respectively), meaning that Yugoslavia needed to win its final qualifier against Croatia in Zagreb, or to draw with Ireland failing to beat Macedonia in [[Skopje]], in order to qualify automatically for Euro 2000. In the event, Ireland conceded an injury-time equaliser, meaning that Yugoslavia's 2\u20132 draw with the Croatians was good enough.\n\nThe draw for the finals placed Yugoslavia in Group C along with Spain, [[Norway national football team|Norway]] and another former Yugoslav republic, [[Slovenia national football team|Slovenia]]. The Slovenians took a surprise 3\u20130 lead in the first game at the [[Stade du Pays de Charleroi]], but three goals in six second-half minutes enabled Yugoslavia to secure a 3\u20133 draw. The team then beat Norway 1\u20130 in [[Li\u00e8ge (city)|Li\u00e8ge]], thanks to an early [[Savo Milo\u0161evi\u0107]] backheel strike. The final group game, against Spain in [[Bruges]], saw the Yugoslavs take the lead three times, before a [[Gaizka Mendieta]] penalty and an [[Alfonso P\u00e9rez|Alfonso]] strike in injury-time secured a dramatic 4\u20133 win for the Spaniards and top spot in the group. Yugoslavia nonetheless finished second, level on points with Norway but ranked ahead due to its victory in Li\u00e8ge. In each of the three games, the team had one player sent off ([[Sini\u0161a Mihajlovi\u0107]], [[Mateja Ke\u017eman]], and [[Slavi\u0161a Jokanovi\u0107]], respectively).\n\nIn the quarter-finals, Yugoslavia was once again paired with the Netherlands. Unlike the last time, the co-hosts made easy work of Yugoslavia, winning 6\u20131 in [[Rotterdam]] with [[Patrick Kluivert]] scoring a hat-trick.\n\nOne of the few bright spots of Yugoslav team in the whole tournament was [[Savo Milo\u0161evi\u0107]], who was crowned the joint top scorer of the tournament, alongside Patrick Kluivert. Both players scored five goals, although Milo\u0161evi\u0107 played one game fewer.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.euro2000.org/en/tournament/page4/0,1074,,00.html | title=Leading goalscorers | work=UEFA.com | publisher=Union of European Football Associations | date=2 July 2000 | accessdate=12 July 2012 | archiveurl=http://web.archive.bibalex.org/web/20000711003231/www.euro2000.org/en/tournament/page4/0,1074,,00.html | archivedate=11 July 2000 }}</ref>\n\n===2002 World Cup campaign===\n\nThe [[2002 FIFA World Cup qualification|2002 qualifiers]] marked the first time that Yugoslavia failed to reach a major tournament ever since its return to the big stage after the UN sanctions. The problems started with the major political turmoil in the country as well in the Yugoslav FA, which prompted the new coach [[Ilija Petkovi\u0107]] to resign only after one game (2\u20130 away victory against [[Luxembourg national football team|Luxembourg]]).\n\n[[Milovan \u0110ori\u0107]] took over the team, but under his leadership, the team managed only two draws (1\u20131 at home vs. [[Switzerland national football team|Switzerland]] and also 1\u20131 away in Slovenia, in both games the opponents managed to equalise in late stages of the game) and a 0\u20131 home loss to [[Russia national football team|Russia]] (which marked the team's first home defeat in official matches). After \u00d0ori\u0107's resignation, a three-man commission, consisting of [[Dejan Savi\u0107evi\u0107]], [[Vujadin Bo\u0161kov]], and [[Ivan \u0106urkovi\u0107]], took over the coaching duties, until Savi\u0107evi\u0107 ultimately took over on his own. The team managed to bounce back with a draw in Russia and a win in Switzerland, but failed to defeat Slovenia in the penultimate game, thus ended the qualifiers in third position.\n\n===2006 World Cup===\n\n{{see also|2006 FIFA World Cup Group C}}\n[[File:Elfenbeink\u00fcste - Serbien und Montenegro.jpg|left|thumb|200px|[[Serbia and Montenegro]] and [[Cote d'Ivoire]] playing in the [[Allianz Arena]] at the 2006 FIFA World Cup]]\n[[File:SCG-BiH 1-0 wc2006 qual Marakana Oct12 2005 Bijeljina.jpg|right|thumb|200px|Serbia and Montenegro against [[Bosnia and Herzegovina national football team|Bosnia and Herzegovina]] in qualifiers for [[2006 FIFA World Cup|2006 World Cup]]]]\nAfter Savi\u0107evi\u0107's disastrous spell as coach of Yugoslavia, the country went under a [[Constitutional Charter of Serbia and Montenegro|political transformation]], and [[Ilija Petkovi\u0107]] became the newly named Serbia and Montenegro's new coach. Initially, the team under his lead experienced dragging failure in the [[UEFA Euro 2004 qualifying|Euro 2004 qualifiers]] while competing for the first time as Serbia and Montenegro. Despite drawing both games against group favorites and eventual group winners [[Italy national football team|Italy]] and winning both games against runners-up [[Wales national football team|Wales]], Serbia and Montenegro failed to qualify, mostly due to an embarrassing 2\u20132 home draw and 2\u20131 away loss to [[Azerbaijan national football team|Azerbaijan]].\n\nQualifying for the [[2006 FIFA World Cup|2006 World Cup]], however, was different. Serbia and Montenegro began the campaign by finishing first with an undefeated record in their [[2006 FIFA World Cup qualification|qualification]] group ahead of favourites Spain. The Serbia and Montenegro team also allowed only one goal in the ten matches, the best defensive record of all 51 teams participating in qualification.\n\nFor the 2006 qualifiers, Serbia and Montenegro was drawn in a group with Spain, [[Belgium national football team|Belgium]], [[Bosnia and Herzegovina national football team|Bosnia and Herzegovina]], [[Lithuania national football team|Lithuania]] and [[San Marino national football team|San Marino]]. Led once again by [[Ilija Petkovi\u0107]] as coach, Serbia and Montenegro played some impressive defensive football\u2014the \"Famous Four\" defense, consisting of [[Nemanja Vidi\u0107]], [[Mladen Krstaji\u0107]], [[Goran Gavran\u010di\u0107]], and [[Ivica Dragutinovi\u0107]], with [[Dragoslav Jevri\u0107]] as goalkeeper, conceded only one goal in ten games, finishing first with a 6\u20134\u20130 record, ahead of Spain.\n\nOn 3 June 2006, following a [[Montenegrin independence referendum, 2006|referendum]], Montenegro declared its independence from Serbia. As the World Cup was about to start, it was decided that the Serbia and Montenegro team that had qualified for the tournament would compete, with the split into separate teams representing the new countries of Montenegro and Serbia to take place once the team was no longer in the tournament.\n\nIn the [[2006 FIFA World Cup|group stage]], Serbia and Montenegro lost their opening game to joint group favourite, the Netherlands. The final score was 1\u20130 after [[Arjen Robben]] scored the only goal of the game. They also lost their second game to Argentina 6\u20130, [[Serbia and Montenegro]]'s worst ever international result. With the team's two losses and with Netherlands and Argentina winning both their games, Serbia and Montenegro could no longer qualify for the knockout matches, and was playing for pride alone in their final group game against [[Ivory Coast national football team|Ivory Coast]]. Despite having a 2\u20130 lead for much of the first half, ''the Elephants'' managed to come back and win 3\u20132, leaving Serbia and Montenegro with a disappointing 0\u20130\u20133 World Cup run.\n\n==Serbia==\nAfter [[Montenegrin independence referendum, 2006|Montenegro declared independence]], Serbia marked independence with a 3\u20131 away victory over the [[Czech Republic national football team|Czech Republic]]. [[Danko Lazovi\u0107]]'s, [[Marko Panteli\u0107]]'s and [[Aleksandar Tri\u0161ovi\u0107]]'s goals led Serbia to victory on this match.\n\n===UEFA Euro 2008 qualifying===\n\n[[File:Srbija-Belgija-7.10.2006.JPG|right|thumb|200px|[[Serbia national football team|Serbia]] against [[Belgium national football team|Belgium]], on 7 October 2006]]\n\nThe [[UEFA Euro 2008 qualifying Group C|2008 UEFA European Football Championship qualifying campaign]] began with a 1\u20130 victory over [[Azerbaijan national football team|Azerbaijan]] by [[Nikola \u017digi\u0107]]'s goal in the 72nd minute on 6 September 2006. Four days later, Serbia drew with [[Poland national football team|Poland]] 1\u20131. Serbia made a two victories in October: 1\u20130 over [[Belgium national football team|Belgium]] and 3\u20130 over [[Armenia national football team|Armenia]]. In 6 matches, Serbia stayed undefeated in 2006 (4 victories, 2 draws). In the first qualifying match in 2007, Serbia unexpectedly lost 1\u20132 from [[Kazakhstan national football team|Kazakhstan]] in [[Almaty]], and four days later (28 March 2007) made a draw in front of 52,000 fans at [[Rajko Miti\u0107 Stadium]] against [[Portugal national football team|Portugal]]. On 2 June 2007, Serbia made a 2\u20130 victory over [[Finland national football team|Finland]] in [[Helsinki]]. In August, he lost from Belgium 2\u20133 away, [[Zdravko Kuzmanovi\u0107]] scored (his first) two goals. After a three draws, Serbia demolished Azerbaijan with 6\u20131 in [[Baku]]. On 21 November 2007, Serbia draw 2\u20132 at home with Poland in the front of 3,000 fans. Three days later, with a low attendance (less than 1,000) at [[Partizan Stadium]], Serbia defeated Kazakhstan by own goal in the 79th minute in the last match of this qualifying cycle. Serbia finished third, three points behind runners-up [[Portugal national football team|Portugal]] and Group A winners [[Poland national football team|Poland]]. Serbia's first ever foreign coach [[Javier Clemente]] was sacked after the failure.\n\n===Golden years (2008\u20132010)===\n\n[[File:Serbia soccer vs france.jpg|right|thumb|200px|Atmosphere at the start of match vs. France, 9 September 2009]]\n\nSerbia replaced Clemente with [[Miroslav \u0110uki\u0107]], but he left the position on 19 August of the following year without having played any official games. Subsequent to \u00d0uki\u0107's rapid departure, who led Serbia on five friendly matches and made three defeats and two draws, [[Radomir Anti\u0107]] was appointed coach. Serbia's [[2010 FIFA World Cup qualification \u2013 UEFA Group 7|World Cup qualification campaign]] began on 6 September 2008. Serbia defeated [[Faroe Islands national football team|Faroe Islands]], by own goal in 30th minute and Nikola \u017digi\u0107's goal in 88th minute. Four days later, Serbia lost from [[2006 FIFA World Cup]] runners-up [[France national football team|France]] 1\u20132 on [[Stade de France]]. A month later, Serbia defeated [[Lithuania national football team|Lithuania]] 3\u20130 with the goals scored by [[Branislav Ivanovi\u0107]] [[Milo\u0161 Krasi\u0107]] and Nikola \u017digi\u0107. On 15 October 2008,\nSerbia broken [[Austria national football team|Austria]] 3\u20131 in [[Vienna]] in the front of 48,000 fans. Krasi\u0107, [[Milan Jovanovi\u0107 (footballer born 1981)|Milan Jovanovi\u0107]] and [[Ivan Obradovi\u0107]] scored goals for 9 minutes (15th, 18th and 24th). By the end of the year, Serbia played one match in November and one in December. First, in November, Serbia demolish [[Bulgaria national football team|Bulgaria]] 6\u20131 in Belgrade. [[Savo Milo\u0161evi\u0107]], the second top goalscorer of all time in Serbia national team, scored twice and missed two penalties in his last match for national team. Serbia lost against Poland in [[Antalya]], in December 0\u20131. In first match in 2009, Serbia made a huge victory over [[Romania national football team|Romania]] in [[Constan\u0163a]]. Romania not defeated in Constan\u0163a seven years, before this match. On 6 June 2009, Serbia defeated Austria 1\u20130 in the front of 52,000 fans at Rajko Miti\u0107 Stadium. [[Nenad Milija\u0161]] scored the only goal, in 7th minute, from ''penalty spot''. Four days later, Serbia made a expected victory (2\u20130) over Faroe Islands in [[T\u00f3rshavn]]. On 9 September 2009, Serbia draw 1\u20131 with world runners-up, France in the front of almost 50,000 fans. Nenad Milija\u0161 scored the only goal for ''Eagles'', in 12th minute, from ''penalty spot'', like against Austria three monts before. On 10 October 2009, Serbia made a huge victory 5\u20130 against Romania and secured placement at [[2010 FIFA World Cup]]. In last match of this qualifying cycle, Lithuania defeated Serbia 2\u20131 in [[Marijampol\u0117]]. In November, Serbia defeat [[Northern Ireland national football team|Northern Ireland]] and [[South Korea national football team|South Korea]] in [[Belfast]] and [[London]], 1\u20130 both matches.\n\n[[File:FIFA World Cup 2010 Serbia Ghana.jpg|left|thumb|200px|Serbia vs. Ghana, 13 June 2010]]\nSerbia placed into Group D with [[Germany national football team|Germany]], team also faced [[2010 Africa Cup of Nations]] runners-up [[Ghana national football team|Ghana]], and [[Australia national football team|Australia]].\n\nTheir opening group game was against Ghana and chances came to both sides but a red card to [[Aleksandar Lukovi\u0107]] and a handball by substitute Zdravko Kuzmanovi\u0107 in the second half gave [[Ghana national football team|Ghana]] a penalty to take all three points at the death. [[Asamoah Gyan]] converted eight minutes from full-time and Serbia were defeated 1\u20130. In Serbia's second group match, they sensationally defeated Germany by a score of 1\u20130 with an acrobatic goal by Milan Jovanovi\u0107 late in the first half. [[FIFA]]'s official YouTube channel called the win \"the most famous day in Serbia's footballing history\". Serbia only needed a single point to reach the knockout stages but were defeated by Australia 2\u20131 in an entertaining match where Serbia's dominance in the first half and in periods of the second half would have made it look like a Serbia victory. Australia scored 2 goals in the second half through [[Tim Cahill]] and [[Brett Holman]]. A late [[Marko Panteli\u0107]] goal served only as a consolation. They finished last in the group.\n\n===Disappointing qualifications (2011\u20132016)===\n\nAfter game against Australia and elimination from World Cup, Serbia start [[UEFA Euro 2012 qualifying|2012 UEFA European Football Championship qualifying campaign]]. The qualifying stage began with Radomir Anti\u0107 as coach and finished with [[Vladimir Petrovi\u0107]]. Serbia and Anti\u0107 started the first two games positively with a 3\u20130 win away to Faroe Islands and a 1\u20131 draw at home to Slovenia but this result brought the end of Anti\u0107's reign as the country's coach. New coach Petrovi\u0107 faced setbacks immediately with an embarrassing 3\u20131 loss at home to [[Estonia national football team|Estonia]] and an abandoned match resulting in a 3\u20130 loss to [[Italy national football team|Italy]] due to crowd trouble from the Serbian away supporters in [[Genoa]]. Serbia returned to form with a 2\u20131 win at home over [[Northern Ireland national football team|Northern Ireland]] but could only manage a 1\u20131 draw away to Estonia. Afterwards, Serbia won back to back games with a 1\u20130 win away to Northern Ireland and a crucial 3\u20131 win at home against Faroe Islands. These results put Serbia in pole position to confirm a play-off spot behind Italy. Serbia needed a win at home against Italy to confirm a play-off spot but their efforts only resulted in a 1\u20131 draw. The team, however, still had one more chance to confirm a play-off place when they faced Slovenia away. This game was a must win even though Serbia had a superior goal difference over Estonia, a draw was not good enough for progression. Serbia played positively and created a number of chances during the game but a long-range goal put Slovenia up 1\u20130 at half time. The Serbians then failed to convert numerous chances that they had in the second half, notably [[Nemanja Vidi\u0107]]'s penalty miss midway through the second half. Serbia left empty handed after a 1\u20130 loss and exited the tournament for the third time in a row during the qualifying group stages, missing out by one point behind Estonia. Vladimir Petrovi\u0107 was sacked after the team's failure to qualify.\n\n[[File:Serbia vs Belgium 2012.jpg|right|thumb|200px|Serbia vs. Belgium,]]\n[[Dejan Stankovi\u0107]] and Nemanja Vidi\u0107 announced that they were retiring from international football. This meant that Serbia had lost two key players and that a new era had started. Branislav Ivanovi\u0107 became the new captain. [[Sini\u0161a Mihajlovi\u0107]], a former member of the national team, was appointed as the coach on 24 April 2012. Serbia was drawn in [[2014 FIFA World Cup qualification&nbsp;\u2013 UEFA Group 1|Group A]] in [[2014 FIFA World Cup qualification|qualification]] for [[2014 FIFA World Cup]], together with [[Croatia national football team|Croatia]], [[Belgium national football team|Belgium]], [[Scotland national football team|Scotland]], [[Macedonia national football team|Macedonia]], and [[Wales national football team|Wales]]. The team began the qualification campaign with a goalless draw with Scotland in [[Glasgow]] and a 6\u20131 win over Wales in [[Novi Sad]]. In the next two games, Serbia suffered two defeats, from [[Macedonia national football team|Macedonia]] in (0\u20131) and Belgium in Belgrade (0\u20133). In 2013, on 22 March, Serbia played in [[Zagreb]] against [[Croatia national football team|Croatia]]. The game was highly anticipated in both countries due to their rivalry both on and off the pitch. Croatia won 2\u20130 and sent Serbia down on the table. Serbia then defeated Scotland 2\u20130 at home in a crucial qualifier, though their World Cup hopes were taken away after a 2\u20131 defeat to Belgium. Serbia drew with Croatia 1\u20131 in the corresponding fixture at home in a spiteful affair, where 18-year-old [[Aleksandar Mitrovi\u0107 (footballer)|Aleksandar Mitrovi\u0107]] scored an equalizer in the second-half after [[Mario Mand\u017euki\u0107]] opened the scoring. They then defeated Wales 0\u20133 in Cardiff. Dejan Stankovi\u0107's farewell game was completed in a friendly against [[Japan national football team|Japan]], which Serbia won 2\u20130. He finished his career with 103 appearances for the national team, a record previously held by [[Savo Milo\u0161evi\u0107]], with 102 appearances. Serbia finished qualifying with a 5\u20131 home win against Macedonia, putting them in third in the group, three points from a playoff spot behind Croatia and group winners Belgium.\n\nDutch [[Dick Advocaat]] was appointed as the coach in July 2014. Serbia was drawn in [[UEFA Euro 2016 qualifying Group I|Group I]] in [[UEFA Euro 2016 qualifying|qualification]] for [[UEFA Euro 2016]], together with [[Portugal national football team|Portugal]], [[Denmark national football team|Denmark]], [[Albania national football team|Albania]] and [[Armenia national football team|Armenia]]. Advocaat started with a draw in a friendly 1\u20131 game against [[France national football team|France]]. The team began qualification with a 1\u20131 draw against Armenia in [[Yerevan]]. In the next abandoned game against Albania in Belgrade, Serbia was originally awarded with a 3\u20130 victory, but was later deducted three points. On 14 November 2014, Serbia played against Denmark in Belgrade and lost, 1\u20133. After this game, Advocaat left, whereupon [[Radovan \u0106ur\u010di\u0107]] was announced as a new coach on 18 November. In 2015, Serbia's first match was a qualifying match against Portugal in [[Lisbon]], during which Serbia lost 2\u20131, cutting their chances for qualification to Euro 2016. On 13 June 2015, Serbia played a qualifying match against Denmark in [[Copenhagen]], losing 2\u20130. On 10 July, the [[Court of Arbitration for Sport]] (CAS) announced that it had awarded a 0\u20133 victory to Albania in the abandoned match held on 14 October 2014, upholding Serbia's three-point penalization. As a result, Serbia became mathematically eliminated from Euro 2016 qualification. On 4 September 2015, Serbia reached first victory in these qualifications, 2\u20130 over Armenia. On 8 October, Serbia made a huge victory over rival Albania in [[Elbasan]]. [[Aleksandar Kolarov]]'s and [[Adem Ljaji\u0107]]'s goals in 91st and 94th minute led Serbia to the victory. In the table of [[UEFA Euro 2016 qualifying Group I|Group I]], Serbia finished second to last place with four points in a five team group.\n\n===The return===\n[[File:Srbija - Gruzija KV SP 2018.jpg|340px|thumb|right|Serbia - Georgia 1-0, World Cup 2018 qualification match at [[Red Star Stadium]]]]\n\nIn first match for [[2018 FIFA World Cup qualification (UEFA)|2018 FIFA World Cup qualification]], Serbia started off their campaign with a 2\u20132 draw against Ireland at the Rajko Mitic Stadium.

Conceded goal in 80th minute has costed Serbia three points. One month later, Serbia made a first victory, over [[Moldova national football team|Moldova]] in [[Chi\u0219in\u0103u]]. Filip Kosti\u0107 scored first goal on the match again, this time in 19th minute. Captain [[Branislav Ivanovi\u0107]] scored in 37th minute. Du\u0161an Tadi\u0107 scored in 59th minute and with one goal and two assists helped Serbia to beat Moldova 3\u20130. Three days later, on 9 October 2016, Serbia defeated Austria (3\u20132) at Rajko Miti\u0107 Stadium and made very important victory. Brace from [[Aleksandar Mitrovi\u0107 (footballer)|Aleksandar Mitrovi\u0107]] in 6th and 23rd minute and Du\u0161an Tadi\u0107's in 74th minute masterpiece helped Serbia to win the match. On 12 November 2016, Aleksandar Mitrovi\u0107's goal in 86th minute, helped Serbia to take a point against Euro 2016 semi-finalists, [[Wales national football team|Wales]] in [[Cardiff]]. On 24 March, in first match in 2017, Serbia defeat 3\u20131 [[Georgia national football team|Georgia]] in [[Tbilisi]].

[[Mijat Ga\u0107inovi\u0107]] replaced Filip Kosti\u0107 81st minute, and scored a goal five minutes later in his first game for national team. On 11 June 2017, Aleksandar Mitrovi\u0107 scored the only goal for Eagles, against Wales (1\u20131) in the front of 47,000 fans at Rajko Miti\u0107 Stadium. On 2 September 2017, Serbia defeated Moldova 3\u20130 at [[Partizan Stadium]]. Mijat Ga\u0107inovi\u0107 scored 20th minute and ten minutes later assisted for [[Aleksandar Kolarov]]'s first goal in these qualifications. Aleksandar Mitrovi\u0107 scored the third goal for Serbia on this match and continued his amazing performance in these qualifications (six goals in last five qualification matches). Three days later, Serbia defeated Ireland in [[Dublin]] 1\u20130 and come on the step of [[2018 FIFA World Cup]]. Aleksandar Kolarov scored a goal in 55th minute. [[Nikola Maksimovi\u0107]] was sent off thirteen minutes later and Eagles played almost half an hour with a player less. Serbia needed a victory on one of two remaining matches. On 6 October, at [[Ernst-Happel-Stadion]] in [[Wien]] Serbia has lost 3\u20132. The Eagles take the lead in 11th minute, after [[Luka Milivojevi\u0107]]'s first goal for national team, but Austria reversed result in 76th minute, but [[Nemanja Mati\u0107]] has scored the equalizer seven minutes later.

A couple days after match, coach [[Slavoljub Muslin]] was sacked. [[Mladen Krstaji\u0107]] succeeded Muslin as coach of the Serbia national team, initially as a caretaker. He led team on two matches in November. In first match, he made victory against [[China national football team|China]] 2\u20130, but in second Serbia draw 1\u20131 with [[South Korea national football team|South Korea]].

The national team, also referred to as ''Sele\u00e7\u00e3o das [[Coat of arms of Portugal#Quinas|Quinas]]'' (Selection of the Quinas), represents the nation of [[Portugal]] in international [[association football|football]]. It is fielded by the [[Portuguese Football Federation]] and competes as one of the foundig memn of [[UEFA]].\n\nThe [[Portugal national football team]] has played its first international match until 1921 and also took part in the [[FIFA World Cup]], where their best finish was third in [[1966 FIFA World Cup|1966]]. Despite reaching the final of the [[2004 UEFA European Football Championship|UEFA Euro 2004]] at home soil, with their [[golden generation]], Portugal won its first major trophy in 2016 the [[2016 UEFA European Football Championship|UEFA Euro 2016]], which was followed by the inaugural [[2018\u201319 UEFA Nations League|UEFA Nations League]] in 2019, making it the second major tournament earned by the Portuguese in three finals.\n\n==Early years==\nThe [[Portuguese Football Federation]] was formed in 1914 under the '''[[Portuguese Football Union]]''' name (by 1926, they changed to its current name) and the aim of creating national tournaments (since it only existed regional championships) and promoting games in which a Portuguese representative team would play against other teams from various parts of the globe, but unfortunately, due to the [[World War I]], the dream was not made possible for the next seven years.\n\nPortugal's first game was on 18 December 1921. The game ended in a defeat for the national team, 3\u20131. The following year, the inaugural edition of the ''[[Ta\u00e7a de Portugal|Campeonato de Portugal]]'' (a knock-out tournament, precursor of the ''[[Ta\u00e7a de Portugal]]'') was contested, the winner was defined as the \"Portuguese Champion\".\n\n==1928 Olympic Tournament==\nAfter years of playing friendly games, Portugal was invited to enter the [[Football at the 1928 Summer Olympics|1928 Summer Olympics Football Tournament]], which was, at that time, contested by the best national \"A\" teams in the world and, therefore, considered to be the best international footballing tournament until the [[FIFA World Cup]] started, two years later, in 1930.\n\nThe Portuguese team was drawn in the preliminary round against [[Chile national football team|Chile]] for a place in the first round. After falling 2\u20130 behind, Portugal scored four goals, winning the game 4\u20132. After their win against Chile, they faced off [[Yugoslavia national football team|Yugoslavia]] and won 2\u20131 thanks to a late goal in the 90th minute.\n\n[[Egypt national football team|Egypt]] was the team that followed in the quarter-finals. Here the Portuguese adventure ended after a 2\u20131 defeat. In the following games, the Egyptians lost against [[Argentina national football team|Argentina]] (6\u20130) in the semi-final and [[Italy national football team|Italy]] (11\u20133) for the bronze medal match, which embittered the players. Nevertheless, it was a bright start in international tournaments for the team.\n\n==Early World Cup attempts==\nPortugal was not invited to the [[1930 FIFA World Cup|1930 World Cup]], which only featured a final stage and no [[FIFA World Cup qualification|qualification round]]. The team took part in the [[1934 FIFA World Cup qualification]], but failed to eliminate their Spanish opponents, aggregating two defeats in the two-legged round, with a 9\u20130 loss in [[Madrid]] and 2\u20131 loss in [[Lisbon]] for an aggregate score of 11\u20131.\n\nIn the [[1938 FIFA World Cup qualification]], the ''Sele\u00e7\u00e3o'' played one game against [[Switzerland national football team|Switzerland]] in a neutral ground, held in [[Milan]], losing 2\u20131 against the Swiss, ending qualification prospects. Because of the international conflict due to the [[World War II]], there was no World Cup held until the [[1950 FIFA World Cup|1950 competition]] and subsequently, the national team made very few games against other teams. A 10\u20130 away friendly defeat against [[England national football team|England]], two years after the war, was the proof of how the irregularity of the games had taken its effects on the squad.\n\n==1950s and early 1960s==\nOn the restart of games, the team [[1950 FIFA World Cup qualification#Group 6|was to play]] a two-legged round against Spain, just like in the 1934 qualification. After a 5\u20131 defeat in Madrid, they managed to draw in the second game 2\u20132 and so the qualification ended with a 7\u20133 aggregate score.\n\nFor the [[1954 FIFA World Cup qualification (UEFA - Group 5/Group 6/Group 9)#Group 5|qualification of the 1954 World Cup]], the team played [[Austria national football team|Austria]]. The Austrians won the first game with a humiliating 9\u20131 result. The best the national team could do was hold the team to a goalless draw in Lisbon, and the round ended with a 9\u20131 defeat.\n\nIn the [[1958 FIFA World Cup qualification (UEFA - Group 8)|1958 qualification]], Portugal finished last in the group stage that also featured [[Northern Ireland national football team|Northern Ireland]] and Italy; only the first-placed team would qualify. They started with a 1\u20131 draw against the Irish team, but lost in [[Belfast]] by a score of 3\u20130. After that, they won 3\u20130 against Italy and lost 3\u20130 in Milan. Finishing with three points, they were two points behind group winners Northern Ireland.\n\nThe year 1960 was the year that UEFA created the [[UEFA European Football Championship|European Football Championship]], a football tournament similar to the FIFA World Cup, but for European nations. The [[Euro 1960|first edition]] was a knock-out tournament, the last four teams participating in final stage that only featured one leg while the older stages had two legs. For the first round, the ''Sele\u00e7\u00e3o das Quinas'' won 2\u20130 against [[East Germany national football team|East Germany]] and 3\u20132 in [[Porto]] for the second leg, finishing with a 5\u20132 two-legged win. The quarter-final opponent was Yugoslavia. Despite winning the first game 2\u20131, they lost the second leg 5\u20131 in [[Belgrade]], and lost 6\u20133 on aggregate.\n\nEngland and [[Luxembourg national football team|Luxembourg]] were the [[1962 FIFA World Cup qualification (UEFA - Group 6)|1962 FIFA World Cup qualification]] adversaries of the national team. Portugal ended second in the group with three points, behind England (with seven points). They started well with a home win (6\u20130) against Luxembourg and a home draw (1\u20131) against the English, but lost the following games, first 4\u20132 against Luxembourg, then 2\u20130 against England. Like in the previous World Cup qualification, only the first in the group would qualify.\n\nThe [[Euro 1964|1964 European Championship]] shared the same format as the 1960 edition. Portugal played against [[Bulgaria national football team|Bulgaria]] in the first round. The Portuguese lost 3\u20131 in [[Sofia]] and won 3\u20131 in Lisbon. With the round tied 4\u20134, a replay was needed in a neutral ground. In [[Rome]], Portugal lost 1\u20130 with a late goal from the Bulgarians.\n\nIn 1964, the [[Ta\u00e7a das Na\u00e7\u00f5es|Nations' Cup]] was held in [[Brazil]]. The event celebrated the 50th anniversary of the founding of the Brazilian Football Confederation. Three international teams were invited \u2013 Argentina, Portugal, and England \u2013 for the competition, which was played in [[Rio de Janeiro]] and [[S\u00e3o Paulo]] in late May and early June, with an all [[Round-robin tournament|round-robin]] format. Portugal ended with one point (five behind winners Argentina) and joint third place with England after two defeats (4\u20131 with Brazil and 2\u20130 with Argentina) and a 1\u20131 tie against England\n\n==1966 World Cup and 1970s==\n{{main|Os Magri\u00e7os}}\nIn the [[1966 FIFA World Cup qualification (UEFA - Group 4)|1966 World Cup qualification]], Portugal was drawn into the same group as [[Czechoslovakia national football team|Czechoslovakia]], [[Romania national football team|Romania]], and [[Turkey national football team|Turkey]]. They topped the group with only one draw and one defeat in all six games and finally qualified for a FIFA World Cup; that year the final stage would be held in England. Notable results were 1\u20130 away wins against Czechoslovakia and Turkey and a 5\u20131 home win against the Turks.\n\nThe team started out with three wins in the group stage, where they were in Group C, against [[Hungary national football team|Hungary]] 3\u20131, Bulgaria 3\u20130, and two-time defending champions [[Brazil national football team|Brazil]] 3\u20131. In the quarter-finals, Portugal played against [[North Korea national football team|North Korea]]. Portugal won the game with four goals from [[Eus\u00e9bio]] overturning a deficit of 3\u20130. Later, they reached the semi-finals but were defeated by hosts and eventual champions England 2\u20131; in this game, Portugal would have played in [[Liverpool]], but as England were the hosts, FIFA decided that the game should be in [[London]], which led the Portuguese team to travel unexpectedly from Liverpool to London. Portugal then defeated the [[USSR national football team|Soviet Union]] 2\u20131 in the third place match for their best World Cup finish to date. Eus\u00e9bio was the top scorer of the World Cup, with nine goals.\n[[File:Eusebio Portugal.JPG|177px|thumb|left|Eus\u00e9bio in 1972]]\n\nFor the [[UEFA Euro 1968 qualifying#Group 2|Euro 1968 qualifying]], the ''Sele\u00e7\u00e3o'' played against Bulgaria, [[Norway national football team|Norway]], and [[Sweden national football team|Sweden]]. They finished second to Bulgaria, with six points, four behind the Bulgarians. Portugal only managed two wins and two draws; both wins came from 2\u20131 results against Norway.\n\nAfter their tremendous success in the 1966 World Cup, Portugal [[FIFA World Cup qualification#Group 1|tried to qualify]] for the [[1970 FIFA World Cup|1970 World Cup]], which was to be held in [[Mexico]]. They finished fourth and last in their group, behind [[Greece national football team|Greece]], Romania, and Switzerland. With only four points (from one win and two ties), Portugal were four points behind group winners Romania.\n\nTo be able to participate in [[UEFA Euro 1972|Euro 1972]], Portugal had to win its [[UEFA Euro 1972 qualifying#Group 5|group that comprised]] the teams of [[Belgium national football team|Belgium]], [[Denmark national football team|Denmark]], and [[Scotland national football team|Scotland]]. Portugal finished second to Belgium with seven points (two less than the Belgians). The three wins the Portuguese had were against Denmark (1\u20130 away, 5\u20130 home) and Scotland in a 2\u20130 home win.\n\nAlso in 1972, Portugal participated in the [[Brazilian Independence Cup]], a tournament that marked the 150th birthday since [[Brazil]] [[Brazilian independence|received its independence from Portugal]]. Winning both group stages (in the first stage, with wins against [[Ecuador national football team|Ecuador]] (3\u20130), [[Iran national football team|Iran]] (3\u20130), Chile (4\u20131) and the [[Republic of Ireland national football team|Republic of Ireland]] (2\u20131) and in the second stage winning against Argentina (3\u20131), drawing [[Uruguay national football team|Uruguay]] (1\u20131) and a 2\u20131 win over the Soviet Union) they qualified for the final with Brazil at the [[Maracan\u00e3 (stadium)|Est\u00e1dio do Maracan\u00e3]]. The Brazilian star [[Jairzinho]] scored in the 89th minute to give Brazil the win.\n\nFor the [[1974 FIFA World Cup qualification (UEFA)#Group 6|1974 qualification stages]], Portugal were placed in an accessible group, but were unable to defeat Bulgaria (2-2) in the decisive match, thus not qualifying. The only country Portugal managed to defeat was [[Cyprus national football team|Cyprus]], winning 4\u20130 and 1\u20130 in [[Nicosia]]. Portugal faced tough competition from the strong [[Poland national football team|Poland]] team to claim the spot that would ensure them a place in the [[1978 FIFA World Cup]] held in [[Argentina]]. They finished second place, behind Poland.\n\n==Late 1970s until early 1990s==\n[[UEFA Euro 1980 qualifying Group 2|The national team was put]] alongside Austria, Belgium, Norway, and Scotland to fight for the first spot in the group, which would allow them to go to the final stage of [[UEFA Euro 1980]]. With nine points, Portugal took third place, three points behind first-placed Belgium. Out of their four wins, the most important were the away win against second-placed Austria (2\u20131) and a home win against Scotland (1\u20130).\n\nFor the [[1982 FIFA World Cup qualification (UEFA)#UEFA Group 6|1982 qualification]] the Portuguese team had to face [[Israel national football team|Israel]], Northern Ireland, Scotland and Sweden for the top two group places. Portugal finished in fourth place with seven points, less four than the first, with wins over group winners Scotland (2\u20131), second-placed Northern Ireland (1\u20130) and last-placed Israel (3\u20130), all in home ground.\n\nDuring [[UEFA Euro 1984 qualifying#Group 2|the campaign for Euro 1984]], Portugal  had to play with [[Finland national football team|Finland]], [[Poland national football team|Poland]] and, highly favourites, Soviet Union. Portugal won the group with a dramatic win over USSR in the last game by a score of 1\u20130 in home ground. With ten points and five wins, the Portuguese had beaten the Soviet Union by one point.\n\nPortugal ended in group B, alongside Spain, West Germany and Romania. In the first two games, they tied 0\u20130 and 1\u20131 against [[West Germany national football team|West Germany]] and Spain, respectively. A 1\u20130 win over Romania gave them second place in the group, which was enough to go through to the knockout stage. [[S.L. Benfica|Benfica]]'s [[Nen\u00e9 (footballer, born 1949)|Tamagnini Nen\u00e9]] scored the winner.\n\nThey played against the hosts, [[France national football team|France]], and eventual champions, in one of the most exciting matches in European Championship history. France scored first, but Portugal equalised almost an hour later. The game was tied after 90 minutes and went into extra time. Portugal made the score 2\u20131 in the first 15 minutes, with both teams having numerous quality scoring chances. In the second half of extra time, France scored in the 114th and 119th minutes to eliminate Portugal 3\u20132 and go through to the final.\n\n[[1986 FIFA World Cup qualification (UEFA)#Group 2|For the 1986 tournament]], the ''Selec\u00e7\u00e3o'' played against Czechoslovakia, [[Malta national football team|Malta]], Sweden, and West Germany for the two spots that would guarantee them a ticket to Mexico. Needing a win in the last game against West Germany in [[Stuttgart]], manager [[Jos\u00e9 Augusto Torres|Jos\u00e9 Torres]] famously said to the press, after being severally doubted that his team would qualify for Mexico 1986, \"Let me dream!\" Portugal went on to win the game 1\u20130 to become the first team to beat West Germany at their home ground in an official match.\n\nPortugal was a fan-favourite to make a good campaign because of their [[UEFA Euro 1984]] tournament. The team exited early in the group stages after a win and two losses. They started with a 1\u20130 win to England. Later, they were beaten by Poland and [[Morocco national football team|Morocco]], 1\u20130 and 3\u20131, respectively. Their staying in Mexico was marked by a doping case, an injured player and, most significantly, by the [[Saltillo affair]], where players refused to train in order to win more prizes from the Football Federation.\n\nWanting to keep present at the major international football tournaments, the Portuguese team attempted to top their [[UEFA Euro 1988 qualifying#Group 2|qualifying group]] in a tight group with favourites Italy, Malta, Sweden and Switzerland. Still, they only managed to win two games in a total of eight disputed, ending in third with eight points, five behind first-placed Italy. Both games were won away from home, in [[Malta]] (1\u20130) and in Sweden against second-placed team (also 1\u20130).[[File:Luis Figo.jpg|190px|thumb|right|[[Lu\u00eds Figo]] playing for Portugal at the [[2006 FIFA World Cup]]]]\n\nThe [[1990 FIFA World Cup qualification - UEFA Group 7|1990 World Cup qualification]] was widely seen as a possibility to go back to the international stage. Along with Belgium, Czechoslovakia, Luxembourg and Switzerland, Portugal fought until the last game to get one of the first two spots of the group. Playing at home against Czechoslovakia, they failed to score and the game ended in a 0-0 allowing the East Europeans to get the second place with twelve points (the same as winners Belgium) with two points ahead of Portugal, who came with the first place. Notable results are the wins against Switzerland, 3\u20131 in Portugal and 2\u20131 in [[Neuch\u00e2tel]].\n\nDuring the draws for the [[UEFA Euro 1992 qualifying Group 6|Euro 1992 qualifying]], [[Netherlands national football team|the Netherlands]] was seen as the strongest team besides Portugal. Greece, Finland and Malta were the other teams. With five wins and eleven points, the Portuguese ended second behind the Dutch, who had two more points than Portugal. A famous result in this campaign was the 1\u20130 home win against the Dutch.\n\nThey participated in the friendly [[1992 U.S. Cup]] along with the host, USA, Italy and Ireland in a round robin tournament. Portugal finished last with one point (six behind winners United States) from a draw with Italy (0\u20130). The other two games were defeats with USA (1\u20130) and the Republic of Ireland (2\u20130).\n\nFor the [[1994 FIFA World Cup qualification (UEFA)#Group 1|\u201994 World Cup qualification]], Portugal played in the same group as [[Estonia national football team|Estonia]], Italy, Malta, Scotland and Switzerland for the two highest places. They disappointed, ending in third with 14 points and six wins, just two points behind winners Italy and one behind second-placed Switzerland. In the last game of the round, Portugal were defeated by Italy in Milan. The ''Selec\u00e7\u00e3o'' managed to win 1\u20130 against Switzerland and 5\u20130 against the Scots, both were home wins. The then manager, [[Carlos Queiroz]], blamed the Football Federation for this failure, saying, \"They should clean the mess that the Federation has.\"\n\n==Golden generation==\nPortugal was invited to play at the [[SkyDome Cup]] in [[Toronto]], [[Canada]] against the then-European champions Denmark and [[Canada men's national soccer team|Canada]]. With a draw against the Canadians (1\u20131) and a win against the Danes, Portugal went on to win the trophy, which was their first win at senior level.\n\n[[UEFA Euro 1996 qualifying#Group6|Portugal managed to reach]] the Euro 1996, by topping their group with twenty-three points, six more than second-placed Republic of Ireland. Their group consisted of [[Austria national football team|Austria]], [[Latvia national football team|Latvia]], [[Liechtenstein national football team|Liechtenstein]], Northern Ireland and Republic of Ireland.\n\nIn the final tournament, Portugal drew 1\u20131 with European Champions Denmark, won 1\u20130 to Turkey and 3\u20130 against [[Croatia national football team|Croatia]], finishing first in their group. In the quarter-finals, they lost 1\u20130 to eventual runners-up [[Czech Republic national football team|Czech Republic]], due to a marvelous [[Karel Poborsk\u00fd]] second-half lob over goalkeeper [[V\u00edtor Ba\u00eda]]. This marked the beginning of the [[Golden Generation]], a group of youngsters who had won the [[FIFA U-20 World Cup]] in [[1989 FIFA World Youth Championship|1989]] and [[1991 FIFA World Youth Championship|1991]] and were now leading the national senior squad.\n\nThe team [[1998 FIFA World Cup qualification (UEFA)#Group 9|almost qualified for the tournament]] that was to be hosted by [[France]]. However, during a qualifier in [[Germany national football team|Germany]], [[Rui Costa]] was sent off by French referee [[Marc Batta]] for taking too long to walk off the field while Portugal was leading 1\u20130. Germany drew the crucial game and was thus able to qualify. This incident is regarded as one of the darkest in Portugal's football history,{{citation needed|date=April 2014}} with FIFA being accused of favouritism in support of Germany, who were the defending Euro '96 champions. The group was made of [[Albania national football team|Albania]], [[Armenia national football team|Armenia]], Germany, Northern Ireland and [[Ukraine national football team|Ukraine]], Portugal ended in third place with 19 points and six wins. Germany finished first with 22 points and Ukraine with twenty, with the Slavics winning a place in the final play-offs. Portugal tied both games with Germany (0\u20130 home and 1\u20131 away).\n\nIn the [[UEFA Euro 2000 qualifying#Group 7|qualifications for the 2000 Euro]], Portugal faced [[Azerbaijan national football team|Azerbaijan]], Hungary, Liechtenstein, Romania and [[Slovakia national football team|Slovakia]]. Portugal gained twenty-three points, just one short of first place Romania, with seven wins. Having not qualified directly into the event, the Portuguese team had the best performance by any runner-up and therefore qualified for the final tournament.\n\nCaptained by [[Fernando Couto]] in the [[Euro 2000|final stage]], they defeated England (3\u20132, recovering from a 2\u20130 disadvantage), Romania (1\u20130) with a late header from [[Costinha]] in [[injury time]], and Germany (3\u20130, from a [[S\u00e9rgio Concei\u00e7\u00e3o]] hat-trick), the last one using the B team, since they were already qualified in first of the group after the other two games, to finish atop their group and then defeated Turkey in the quarter-finals (2\u20130, with both goals from [[Nuno Gomes]]).\n\nIn the semi-final meeting with World Cup holders France, Portugal scored first and nearly scored again due to a [[Jo\u00e3o Vieira Pinto|Jo\u00e3o Pinto]]'s header after France equalised. Portugal were eliminated in extra time by a [[golden goal]] when [[Zinedine Zidane]] converted a [[Penalty kick (association football)|penalty]]. [[Austria]]n referee [[Gunter Benko]] awarded the spot kick for a handball after Abel Xavier blocked a shot from [[Sylvain Wiltord]] (Benko initially gave France a corner but changed his mind after consulting with [[Slovakia|Slovak]] linesman Igor Sramka). Xavier, Nuno Gomes (one of the top scorers in the tournament with four goals), and [[Paulo Bento]] were all given lengthy suspensions for shoving the referee.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/euro2000/teams/portugal/default.stm |title=BBC SPORT &#124; EURO2000 &#124; PORTUGAL |publisher=[[BBC News]] |date=2000-07-03 |accessdate=2016-07-31}}</ref> The final result was 2\u20131.\n\nDuring the [[2002 FIFA World Cup qualification - UEFA Group 2|World Cup 2002 qualification]], Portugal made a crucial win against the Netherlands (2\u20130 in [[Rotterdam]]) and ties against Republic of Ireland (1\u20131 in both games) and the Netherlands (2\u20132), in Porto, after falling 2\u20130 behind and scoring in the dying minutes of the game. Portugal won the group with seven wins and three ties with no defeats and 24 points (the same as the Republic of Ireland), but with a better goal average.\n\nWhile the 2002 World Cup qualifying stage was unusually smooth, several problems and poor judgment decisions occurred during the preparation and tournament itself \u2013 shopping sprees by players, this time in [[Macau]], were widely reported in the Portuguese press. Questionable managing choices and some amateurism, including the same lack of agreement on prizes. [[V\u00edtor Ba\u00eda]] replaced in-form [[Ricardo (footballer, born 1976)|Ricardo]] in [[Goalkeeper (association football)|goal]], [[Roberto Severo|Beto]] played out of position at [[right back]], [[Lu\u00eds Figo]] was in very poor physical condition, and [[Hugo Viana]] was called as a last-minute replacement for [[Daniel Kenedy]] (who tested positive in a [[Use of performance-enhancing drugs in sport|doping]] control test) \u2013 as Portugal underachieved and ended third in its group stage, subsequently eliminated. The manager [[Ant\u00f3nio Lu\u00eds Alves Ribeiro Oliveira|Oliveira]] was fired after the World Cup.\n\nPortugal entered the tournament as favourites to win Group D. However, they were upset 3\u20132 by the [[United States men's national soccer team|United States]], at one point being three goals down in the match. They then rebounded with a 4\u20130 smashing Poland, with [[Pauleta]] netting a [[hat-trick]].\n\nNeeding a draw to advance, they lost the final group game to hosts [[South Korea national football team|South Korea]]. [[Argentina|Argentine]] referee [[\u00c1ngel S\u00e1nchez (referee)|\u00c1ngel S\u00e1nchez]] sent off [[Jo\u00e3o Vieira Pinto]] for a tackle on [[Park Ji-Sung]].

On the preparation, the Football Federation made a contract with [[Luiz Felipe Scolari]] to manage the team until the tournament ended. Despite the disappointed friendly matches, the Portuguese team entered the tournament being a favourite to win it.\n\n[[File:Portugiesische Fans bei der Euro 2004.jpg|left|thumb|260px|Portuguese fans supporting the national team]]\nThe host nation lost the first game against Greece 1\u20132, an upset. They got their first win against [[Russia national football team|Russia]] 2\u20130 and also beat a strong Spain side 1\u20130, with the latter eventually knocked out in the group stages.\n\nThey went through and went on to play against England, in an entertaining 2\u20132 draw that went into penalties, where [[Ricardo (footballer, born 1976)|Ricardo]] proved decisive, with an epic attitude taking off his goalkeeping gloves, saving a penalty and scoring right after the winner himself. Portugal beat the Netherlands 2\u20131 in the semi-final with a [[Maniche]] strike from outside the box. They were eventually beaten by heavy underdog outsiders Greece 1\u20130, credited to [[Striker (association football)|striker]] [[Angelos Charisteas]], marking the first time in the history of the competition that the final featured the same two teams as the opening match. The match was considered a dominant win for Greece.\n\nAfter the tournament ended, a lot of players belonging to the ''Gera\u00e7\u00e3o de Ouro'' (Golden Generation), abandoned their international footballing careers, with only [[Lu\u00eds Figo]] remaining in the team, despite a temporary retirement. The only silver lining for Portugal was the emergence of Cristiano Ronaldo as a key player, who had just signed for Manchester United and had been a real revelation. Ronaldo scored two goals and was selected in the UEFA Euro All Stars Team. He would go on to become the captain of the national side after the retirement of Luis Figo. While Portugal was playing in the competition, Scolari agreed in a new two-year deal with the Federation.\n\nPortugal finished first in the [[2006 FIFA World Cup qualification - UEFA Group 3|qualifying round for the 2006 World Cup]] with 30 points, nine games won, three draws, and no defeats. The second-placed Russia finished with seven points less. The ''Sele\u00e7\u00e3o'' played with Estonia, Latvia, Liechtenstein, Luxembourg, Russia, and Slovakia.\n\nPortugal finished first place in Group D of the World Cup finals, with victories over [[Angola national football team|Angola]] (1\u20130, goal from Pauleta, the leading goalscorer in the [[2006 FIFA World Cup qualification|World Cup qualifiers]]), Iran (2\u20130, scored by [[Deco]], and [[Cristiano Ronaldo]]) and [[Mexico national football team|Mexico]] (2\u20131, goals from [[Maniche]] and [[Sim\u00e3o Sabrosa|Sim\u00e3o]]). Only Mexico's [[Francisco Fonseca]] was able to score against Portugal.\n\nThe Netherlands lost to Portugal 1\u20130 in the Round of 16 on 25 June in [[Frankenstadion|Nuremberg]]. The only goal came courtesy of a Maniche strike in an acrimonious match marked by 16 yellow cards, with four players ([[Khalid Boulahrouz]], [[Costinha]], [[Deco]], and [[Giovanni van Bronckhorst]]) being sent off. (See the [[Battle of Nuremberg (association football)|Battle of Nuremberg]].)\n[[File:Charisteas' Siegtreffer im Finale der Euro 2004.jpg|250px|thumb|right|Portugal lost the [[UEFA Euro 2004]] final by 1\u20130.]]\n\nOn 1 July at [[Veltins-Arena|Gelsenkirchen]], Portugal drew 0\u20130 after extra-time with England, but won 3\u20131 on [[Penalty shootout (association football)|penalties]] to reach their first World Cup semi-final since 1966. Cristiano Ronaldo scored the winning penalty. The game was marred by a violent challenge on Portuguese defender [[Ricardo Carvalho]] by England's [[Wayne Rooney]], which resulted in him being sent off. Cristiano Ronaldo was accused by England fans to have influenced the referee's decision to send Rooney off despite the two of them being teammates at Manchester United.\n\nPortugal lost 1\u20130 against France in the semi-finals on 5 July at [[Allianz Arena|Munich]]. Two players had been forced to sit out due to accumulated bookings from the round of 16 and quarter-finals. It did not help that the team faced a hostile crowd of English and French fans; they relentlessly booed Ronaldo for his perceived unsportsmanlike behavior in the previous round. As in the semi-finals of Euro 2000, Portugal were narrowly defeated by France, with the decisive goal being a penalty scored by [[Zinedine Zidane]] after [[Thierry Henry]] was awarded a penalty from a foul committed by Ricardo Carvalho.\n\nPortugal faced Germany in the third place play-off match on 8 July in [[Gottlieb-Daimler-Stadion|Stuttgart]]. The match was notable for being Pauleta's last game for the national team so as captain [[Lu\u00eds Figo]]'s last before retirement from international football \u2013 though, surprisingly, he was not selected to start the game, coming on as a substitute near the end and setting up Portugal's goal in a 3\u20131 defeat. All three German goals had the direct participation of [[Bastian Schweinsteiger]], who scored twice and had another shot turned into an own goal by Portugal's [[Petit (Portuguese footballer)|Petit]]. Ultimately, the team won the \"Most Entertaining Team\" award for their play during the World Cup, in an award always organized through public participation in a poll. Cristiano Ronaldo missed out on the U-23 Player of the Tournament award and it was believed that FIFA's decision was influenced due to hate mail from supporters of England who were still upset with Ronaldo's part in getting Rooney sent off in the quarter - final stage. Once again Scolari was asked to accept a new deal with the Federation that would maintain with as the manager until the end of the next competition.\n\n==Euro 2008==\n\nAfter the successes of the Euro 2004 and the 2006 FIFA World Cup, Portugal was seen as a major contender to win the [[Euro 2008]], but [[UEFA Euro 2008 qualifying Group A|their qualification]] wasn't easy. The national team faced some problems in the last games, in addition, Scolari was suspended for three games, being substituted by his assistant manager. Portugal ended with seven wins and twenty-seven points (one less than first-placed Poland). Armenia. Azerbaijan, Belgium, Finland, [[Kazakhstan national football team|Kazakhstan]], Poland and Serbia were the opponents. With important triumphs against Azerbaijan (2\u20130 in [[Baku]]), Kazakhstan (2\u20131 in [[Almaty]]) and Belgium (4\u20130 in Lisbon and 2\u20131 in [[Brussels]]), they managed to qualify for the final stage.\n\nThe Portuguese team was a featured part of TV network [[ESPN]]s ad campaign promoting their coverage of the [[UEFA Euro 2008]] tournament.{{citation needed|date=July 2012}} The first game was against Turkey and it was won 2\u20130, with first-ever scoring achievements for internationals [[Pepe (footballer born 1983)|Pepe]] and [[Raul Meireles]]. Their second game was against the Czech Republic, a 3\u20131 success. With assured qualification to the knockout stage, as first in group A, they played with the reserve team against Switzerland, and lost 2\u20130, with two [[Hakan Yakin|Hakan Yak\u0131n]] goals. During the group stage, Scolari announced to the squad that it would be his last spell as the Portuguese manager, ending a five-year era full of prosperity.\n\nOn 19 June 2008, Portugal played against Germany, and were beaten 2\u20133 after falling behind 0\u20132 within the first half an hour. Portugal proceeded to score, followed by another Germany goal, a [[Michael Ballack]] header. Portugal scored a consolation goal in the final minutes of normal time, courtesy of [[H\u00e9lder Postiga]], but was eventually knocked out of Euro 2008 at the quarterfinal stage.\n\n==2010 FIFA World Cup==\nPortugal [[2010 FIFA World Cup qualification - UEFA Group 1|participated in the qualifying stages]] with manager [[Carlos Queiroz]] for the [[2010 FIFA World Cup]], which took place in [[South Africa]]. The team had a qualifying campaign that almost turned disastrous and just sneaked into second place by a single point over [[Sweden national football team|Sweden]], a group where [[Denmark national football team|Denmark]] finished first, one point ahead from Portugal. Portugal was drawn to play against [[Bosnia and Herzegovina national football team|Bosnia and Herzegovina]] in the [[2010 FIFA World Cup qualification - UEFA Second Round|European zone play-offs]]. With two wins (1\u20130 in the first leg, in Lisbon; and 1\u20130, in [[Zenica]]), the team gained its right to participate in the World Cup. Having qualified for the 2010 FIFA World Cup, the ''Sele\u00e7\u00e3o das Quinas'' had its most successful decade to date, having qualified for all of the World Cups and Euro Cups (Euro 2000, World Cup 2002, Euro 2004, World Cup 2006, Euro 2008, and World Cup 2010), along with [[Spain national football team|Spain]], [[Italy national football team|Italy]], [[Germany national football team|Germany]], and [[France national football team|France]], the only other four teams to have done so. \n[[File:FIFA World Cup 2010 Portugal North Korea7.jpg|right|thumb|300px|Portuguese players celebrating a goal against North Korea on 21 June 2010]]\nIn the final draw, on 4 December 2009, Portugal was drawn in one of the toughest groups, the so-called ''[[Group of Death]]'' where the ''Sele\u00e7\u00e3o das Quinas'' faced 5-time champions [[Brazil National Football Team|Brazil]], [[Africa]]'s top contenders [[Ivory Coast national football team|Ivory Coast]] and [[1966 FIFA World Cup|1966]] opponents [[North Korea national football team|North Korea]].\n\nPortugal faced [[Ivory Coast national football team|Ivory Coast]] in their opening match on 15 June 2010 at the [[Nelson Mandela Bay Stadium]] in [[Port Elizabeth]] and the game ended in a goalless draw. Their next match was against North Korea on 21 June 2010 at the [[Cape Town Stadium]] in [[Cape Town]] in which Portugal won by 7\u20130. Their last match in the group stage against Brazil on 25 June 2010 at the [[Moses Mabhida Stadium]] in [[Durban]] ended in a goalless 0\u20130 while both teams advanced to the knockout stage. Portugal was on a 19 match undefeated streak, conceding only 3 goals. The Portuguese defence ended being broken by Spain's [[David Villa]]'s goal which defeated Portugal in the round of 16, 1\u20130.\n\nDuring the Tournament, Queiroz was frequently criticised for setting up the team in an overly cautious way. The team's style of play was to keep the team well closed in the back, while sending direct balls up to the front, most notably to a lonely [[Cristiano Ronaldo]], whose mission seemed to be to run at the opposition's defence and try long shots to take advantage of the tricky [[Adidas Jabulani|Jabulani]]. This approach was widely criticised, with an outburst coming from [[Deco]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.record.xl.pt/arquivo/interior.aspx?content_id=446356 |title=Pesquisa por - Jornal Record |website=Record.xl.pt |date= |accessdate=2016-07-31}}</ref> as well as implied from [[Cristiano Ronaldo]]'s reply to a post-game comment after the defeat against Spain. When asked about the team's performances, he answered with a dry \"You can go ask Queiroz\".\n\nThe direct football style was perceived as not taking full advantage of the Portuguese midfield, filled with top-flight players such as [[Cristiano Ronaldo]], [[Deco]], [[Raul Meireles]], [[Sim\u00e3o Sabrosa|Sim\u00e3o]], where a creative possession-based football had been the basis of the team in the preceding years. Although the team reached their base objective of getting past the group phase, and lost out to the eventual world champions, there was a palpable feeling that the team could have gone further had the coach been more ambitious.\n\nA few months after the World Cup, and just days before the beginning of the Euro 2012 Qualifiers, squad regulars Sim\u00e3o, [[Paulo Ferreira]], and [[Miguel Monteiro|Miguel]] all retired from international duty, stating they wanted to focus entirely on their respective clubs. In January 2011, a few weeks before the friendly match against [[Argentina national football team|Argentina]], midfielder [[Tiago Mendes|Tiago]] also retired from international football at just 29 years of age, stating personal reasons.\n\n==Euro 2012==\nAs [[Carlos Queiroz]] suffered from criticism regarding the World Cup, he was also banned from coaching the national team for one month after an investigation concluded that he tried to block a doping test to the team while preparing for the World Cup in Portugal, as well as directing insulting words to the testers.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.record.xl.pt/Futebol/selecoes//interior.aspx?content_id=457989 |title=Sele\u00e7\u00f5es - Jornal Record |website=Record.xl.pt |date= |accessdate=2016-07-31}}</ref> In consequence, he received a further six-month suspension. This meant that Queiroz was not able to select the players or lead the team for the first two Euro 2012 qualifiers against [[Cyprus national football team|Cyprus]] and [[Norway national football team|Norway]]. In the sequence of these events, Portugal drew 4\u20134 against Cyprus at home, followed by a 1\u20130 defeat at the hands of Norway, placing the team in a difficult position right from the start. That prompted several media outbursts from Queiroz<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.record.xl.pt/Futebol/selecoes//interior.aspx?content_id=458171 |title=Sele\u00e7\u00f5es - Jornal Record |website=Record.xl.pt |date= |accessdate=2016-07-31}}</ref> against the heads of the Portuguese Football Federation, which then prompted his dismissal as the head of the team.\n[[File:Portugal national football team 20120609.jpg|220px|thumb|left|Portugal at the [[UEFA Euro 2012]]]]\n\nIn reaction to this dismissal, and in face of impending failure to qualify for [[UEFA Euro 2012]], missing out to the first major final stage since the [[1998 FIFA World Cup|1998 World Cup]], the Federation's president, Gilberto Mada\u00edl, traveled to [[Madrid]] in a bid to persuade superstar [[Real Madrid C.F.|Real Madrid]] manager [[Jos\u00e9 Mourinho]] to lead his nation's team for the matches against [[Denmark national football team|Denmark]] and [[Iceland national football team|Iceland]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://aeiou.expresso.pt/madail-quer-mourinho-na-selecao=f604026 |title=Expresso &#124; Mada\u00edl quer Mourinho na sele\u00e7\u00e3o |website=Aeiou.expresso.pt |date= |accessdate=2016-07-31}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|author= |url=http://desporto.publico.pt/noticia.aspx?id=1456112 |title=Selec\u00e7\u00e3o: Mada\u00edl tenta Mourinho para dois jogos - P\u00daBLICO |website=Desporto.publico.pt |date=2010-09-16 |accessdate=2016-07-31}}</ref> This bid, however, was blocked by Real Madrid President [[Florentino P\u00e9rez]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.record.xl.pt/Futebol/selecoes//interior.aspx?content_id=464111 |title=Sele\u00e7\u00f5es - Jornal Record |website=Record.xl.pt |date= |accessdate=2016-07-31}}</ref>\n\nOn 21 September 2010, [[Paulo Bento]], the former [[Sporting Clube de Portugal]] coach, was appointed as the Portuguese head coach. Paulo Bento's spell with the Sele\u00e7\u00e3o began with a 3\u20131 home win against Denmark, followed by a 3\u20131 away win against Iceland, pushing Portugal into the second spot of the group. On 17 November, Portugal and Spain faced each other in a friendly to commemorate the 100th year of the modern Portuguese Republic and also to promote the joint Portugal-Spain bid to host the 2018 FIFA World Cup. In a shocking upset, Portugal were 4-0 victors over the reigning World and European champions. In the match Ronaldo should score a wonderful opening goal, only rued out as offside with a little kick by Nani in front of the crossing line. Portugal ended up winning all except one of their remaining qualifying games only losing to Denmark. They finished second in their group and had to qualify in a two-game playoff with Bosnia and Herzegovina. They tied the first game 0\u20130 in [[Zenica]] and won 6\u20132 in Lisbon, securing a place in Euro 2012.\n\nPortugal didn't start off the tournament well, as they were defeated 1-0 by Germany. Despite this they bounced back to win their next two games, with a 3\u20132 win over Denmark and a 2\u20131 win over the Netherlands. These two wins secured passage to the knockout stages. They faced the Czech Republic in the quarter finals, and won after a Cristiano Ronaldo goal in the 79th minute. They faced Spain in the semifinals, where the match went into penalties after a goalless 120 minutes. Spain defeated Portugal 4\u20132 on penalty kicks.\n\n==2014 FIFA World Cup==\nOn 30 July 2011 at the [[2014 FIFA World Cup qualification (UEFA)|2014 FIFA World Cup preliminary draw]], Portugal were placed in [[2014 FIFA World Cup qualification \u2013 UEFA Group F|Group F]] along with [[Russia national football team|Russia]], [[Israel national football team|Israel]], [[Northern Ireland national football team|Northern Ireland]], [[Azerbaijan national football team|Azerbaijan]] and [[Luxembourg national football team|Luxembourg]].<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.fifa.com/worldcup/preliminarydraw/news/newsid=1483519/index.html |title=The Preliminary Draw results in full |publisher = FIFA |date=30 July 2011 |accessdate=5 January 2012}}</ref> Portugal had a slightly shaky Qualifying campaign, finishing second in the group after three draws and 1\u20130 loss to the eventual group winners Russia.

They won the first game in [[Lisbon]] 1\u20130 after a Ronaldo goal, then won the second game in [[Solna]] after a Ronaldo hat-trick. These wins secured Portugal's place in the [[2014 FIFA World Cup]].\n\nPortugal were drawn into [[2014 FIFA World Cup Group G|Group G]] with [[German national football team|Germany]], [[Ghana national football team|Ghana]], and the [[United States men's national soccer team|United States]]. They played Germany first at the [[Itaipava Arena Fonte Nova|Arena Fonte Nova]]. Germany took the lead early on with a [[Thomas M\u00fcller]] penalty kick after a foul on [[Mario G\u00f6tze]]. Germany took a 2\u20130 lead after a goal by [[Toni Kroos]]. Pepe was involved in an altercation with Thomas M\u00fcller, where he headbutted M\u00fcller and was shown a straight red card. Germany went on to win the game 4\u20130 after two more goals by Thomas M\u00fcller. This is Portugal's worst loss ever at a World Cup.\n\nIn their next match with the United States, Portugal opened to scoring early, with Nani scoring in the fifth minute. However, the USA equalized after a goal from [[Jermaine Jones]] in the sixty fourth minute. The United States ended up taking the lead in the eighty first minute after a goal by [[Clint Dempsey]]. [[Cristiano Ronaldo]] crossed for [[Silvestre Varela]] who tied the game in the ninety fifth minute, keeping Portugal's qualification hopes alive.\n\nIn their last match in the group stage, in order to progress they needed to beat Ghana by at least 4 goals, and hope that the United States-Germany match didn't end in a draw. Despite Portugal winning the game 2\u20131, and Germany defeating the USA 1\u20130, Portugal were eliminated on goal differential to the USA.\n\n==Fernando Santos era and Euro 2016 win==\n===Euro 2016===\nPortugal was drawn in [[UEFA Euro 2016 qualifying Group I|Group I]] for [[UEFA Euro 2016 qualifying]] with [[Albania national football team|Albania]], [[Armenia national football team|Armenia]], [[Denmark national football team|Denmark]], and [[Serbia national football team|Serbia]]. Portugal started off with a 1\u20130 loss to Albania, which resulted in [[Paulo Bento]] being dismissed, and veteran of all three of the major clubs in [[Primeira Liga]], [[Fernando Santos (Portuguese footballer)|Fernando Santos]], being brought in as his replacement. Under Santos Portugal would win the rest of its games in qualifying, all by a single goal, and top their group.\n\nDuring the [[UEFA Euro 2016|final tournament]] Portugal were drawn in [[UEFA Euro 2016 Group F|Group F]] with [[Iceland national football team|Iceland]], [[Austria national football team|Austria]] and [[Hungary national football team|Hungary]]. Three draws, including a thrilling 3\u20133 match with Hungary in the last group game, gave Portugal a third-placed finish in their group; however, the new expanded form of the tournament meant Portugal qualified for the knockout stages as one of the best third ranked teams.\n\nPortugal played [[Croatia national football team|Croatia]] in the round of 16. The match produced no shots on goal in ninety minutes. In the 116th minute [[Ivan Peri\u0161i\u0107]] hit the post for Croatia, and under a minute later Cristiano Ronaldo started a move passing to [[Renato Sanches]], who ran it down the field. He passed it to Nani, whose scuffed shot landed at the feet of Ronaldo who had the first shot on goal in the game, which was saved, however the rebound was headed in by substitute [[Ricardo Quaresma]]. Portugal held on and moved on to face [[Poland national football team|Poland]] in the quarter-finals.\n\nThe quarter-finals didn't start out well for Portugal, as [[Robert Lewandowski]] scored for Poland in the 2nd minute. Renato Sanches would equalize for Portugal in the 33rd minute. The game went to penalties, where [[Rui Patr\u00edcio]] made a save on [[Jakub B\u0142aszczykowski]], and on the next spot kick, Ricardo Quaresma won the game for Portugal, and sent them to the semi-finals.\n\nThere, Portugal would face [[Wales national football team|Wales]]. Cristiano Ronaldo gave Portugal the lead from a header in the 50th minute. This goal tied Ronaldo with [[Michel Platini]] for all-time leading scorer at the Euro finals, with nine goals. Just 3 minutes after this goal, Nani gave Portugal a 2\u20130 lead with an assist by Ronaldo.

France came close to winning the game in the last minute of normal time, when [[Andr\u00e9-Pierre Gignac]] struck the post. In extra time, Portugal's [[Rapha\u00ebl Guerreiro]] hit the crossbar from a free kick. [[\u00c9der]], a substitute striker, eventually scored the winning goal in the 109th minute. With this win Portugal won its first ever major international trophy in the nation's history, led by Cristiano Ronaldo as the captain. Portugal's Renato Sanches was awarded the best young player and Cristiano Ronaldo won the Silver Boot for his 3 goals and 3 assists in the finals.\n\n===2017 FIFA Confederations Cup===\nFollowing their [[UEFA Euro 2016|Euro 2016]] victory, Portugal was allowed to participate in the [[2017 FIFA Confederations Cup]]. Portugal were drawn into [[2017 FIFA Confederations Cup Group A|Group A]] with [[Mexico national football team|Mexico]], [[New Zealand national football team|New Zealand]] and hosts [[Russia national football team|Russia]]. In the opening match, Portugal faced Mexico. [[Ricardo Quaresma]] opened the scored in the 34th minute, following an assist from [[Cristiano Ronaldo]]. However, due to defensive errors [[Javier Hern\u00e1ndez]] scored the equaliser in the 42nd minute. In the second half, [[C\u00e9dric Soares]] restored the advantage for Portugal, but minutes later Mexico would tie the game 2\u20132 after a header from H\u00e9ctor Moreno, ending the match in a draw.\n\nIn the next match, Portugal faced hosts Russia. The Portuguese dominated the Russians from the beginning, and the goal came naturally in thr 9th minute, scored by Cristiano Ronaldo. Afterwards, [[Raphael Guerreiro]] injured himself during the game, being unable to play the rest of the competition, and the match ended with the Portuguese winning. In their last group stage match, Portugal faced New Zealand. Portugal took the advantage in the first half, with goals from Cristiano Ronaldo and [[Bernardo Silva]]. The result would be 4\u20130 in the second half after [[Andr\u00e9 Silva (footballer, born 1995)|Andr\u00e9 Silva]] and [[Nani]] also put the ball in the back of the net. Thus, Portugal went to the semi-finals of the competition as the first place team of Group B, with a better goal difference than Mexico.\n\nIn the semi-finals, Portugal faced [[Copa Am\u00e9rica]] winners [[Chile national football team|Chile]]. The game was extremely close with dangerous situations fot both sides and went into extra time after 90 minutes without a goal. The draw persisted for the entire amount of extra time. During this time, [[Gelson Martins]] replaced [[Andr\u00e9 Gomes]], this being the first time a fourth substitution had been made in an official tournament match. Even before the extra time was over, Chile struck the post twice. The Chileans would eventually be victorious on penalties, with keeper [[Claudio Bravo]] savng all three Portuguese shots. Portugal thus missed out on qualification to the final and an unprecedented title.\n\n{{multiple image\n | align     = right\n | direction = horizontal\n | header    =\n | header_align = left/right/center\n | header_background =\n | footer = Pepe celebrates after scoring a late equalizer against [[Mexico national football team|Mexico]] at the [[2017 FIFA Confederations Cup]] in [[Moscow]].\n | footer_align = left/right/center\n | footer_background =\n | width     =\n | image1    = Mex-por-69.jpg\n | width1    = 200\n | caption1  = \n | alt1      = photograph of a man sucking his thumbs\n | image2    = Mex-por-71.jpg\n | width2    = 193\n | caption2  =\n | alt2      = \n}}\nIn the [[2017 FIFA Confederations Cup#Third place play-off|third place]] play-off match, Portugal faced Mexico in a rematch from the group stage. Andr\u00e9 Silva had the opportunity to put Portugal ahead but missed a penalty in the 17th minute. It would be Mexico to open the scoring thanks to Luis Neto's own goal in the 55th minute. Pepe managed to restore equality at 91st minute, sending the game into extra time. During extra time, [[Adrien Silva]] took another penalty, this time successfully, but shortly afterwards [[N\u00e9lson Semedo]] left the team reduced to 10 after being sent off. Despite the numerical advantage on the field, [[Ra\u00fal Jim\u00e9nez]] would eventually also see a red card for a foul on [[Eliseu]]. The result would be unchanged at 2\u20131 until the end. Thus, the Portuguese managed to reach the podium of the competition, finishing in third place.\n\n===2018 FIFA World Cup===\nIn the [[2018 FIFA World Cup qualification (UEFA)|2018 FIFA World Cup preliminary draw]], Portugal were placed in [[2018 FIFA World Cup qualification \u2013 UEFA Group B|Group B]] along with [[Switzerland national football team|Switzerland]], Hungary, [[Faroe Islands national football team|Faroe Islands]], [[Andorra national football team|Andorra]] and [[Latvia national football team|Latvia]]. Portugal would only lose one match in qualifying: a 2\u20130 loss in their opener against Switzerland. However, Portugal would get redemption in their last group stage match, defeating Switzerland 2\u20130 to top their group on goal difference and qualify for the 2018 World Cup.\n\nIn the [[2018 FIFA World Cup]], Portugal were drawn into [[2018 FIFA World Cup Group B|Group B]] with Spain, Morocco and Iran. In their opening match on 15 June, Portugal played against Spain. Cristiano Ronaldo scored with an early penalty, winning it after he was fouled by [[Nacho (footballer, born 1990)|Nacho]] inside the box. [[Diego Costa]] then twisted and turned away from two Portugal defenders to score with a low shot to the left corner which brought the two sides level. But just before the break, [[David de Gea]] fumbled a Ronaldo shot from outside the penalty area through his gloves and over the line. Costa scored his second equaliser of the night just after the restart from close range before Nacho scored with a right foot half-volley in off the post from the edge of the penalty box, his first goal for Spain. As the clock ticked down, however, [[Gerard Piqu\u00e9]] brought down Ronaldo just outside the box, with the Portugal star completing the scoring and his hat-trick with a free kick into the top right corner of the net. The match would finish 3\u20133.\n\nIn the second match, Portugal faced Morocco. Early in the match, [[Jo\u00e3o Moutinho]] swung in a cross from the right after a short corner and Cristiano Ronaldo headed the ball powerfully past goalkeeper [[Munir Mohand Mohamedi|Munir Mohamedi]] from six yards out and into the middle of the goal to open the scoring. Ronaldo played [[Gon\u00e7alo Guedes]] into the box but Munir made a one-handed save. Ronaldo shot over the crossbar when Bernardo Silva's mishit presented him with a shooting chance on the edge of the box early in the second half. [[Rui Patr\u00edcio]] then made a save to preserve Portugal's lead when [[Hakim Ziyech]]'s free kick was headed towards goal by [[Youn\u00e8s Belhanda]], the goalkeeper diving to palm the ball away from danger. Ziyech shot another set-piece just over the crossbar from 25 yards. [[Nordin Amrabat]] and [[Medhi Benatia]] fired over with better chances. With their second loss in a row, Morocco became the first team eliminated from the 2018 FIFA World Cup.\n\nPortugal's last group stage match was against Iran. In the 45th minute, Ricardo Quaresma cut in from the right before scoring with a curling shot off the outside of his right foot that looped over [[Alireza Beiranvand]] into the top-left corner. [[Saeid Ezatolahi]]'s foul on Cristiano Ronaldo won Portugal a penalty, which Ronaldo shot low into the right, enabling Beiranvand to get down and make a stop. Iran then managed to get a penalty in stoppage time after the referee used VAR to determine that C\u00e9dric's handball from [[Sardar Azmoun]]'s header had been intentional, which Karim Ansarifard converted high to his right. The game ended in a 1\u22121 draw, with Portugal advancing to te round of 16 as the runners-up of their group, after Spain drew 2\u22122 with Morocco.\n\nPortugal would be eliminated from the tournament after losing to [[Uruguay national football team|Uruguay]] in the round of 16. In the seventh minute, [[Edinson Cavani]] switched play from right to left with a sweeping pass out to [[Luis Su\u00e1rez]], who delivered a cross which the former headed home at the back post from six yards out. In the 55th minute, Rapha\u00ebl Guerreiro delivered a cross from a short corner on the left, which Pepe finished with a downward header. Just seven minutes later, [[Rodrigo Bentancur]] collected the ball around 30 yards out and slipped a pass out to Cavani on the left side of the penalty area, who then scored his second goal of the match with a curling right-foot strike into the right corner of the net to reclaim the lead for Uruguay. Bernardo Silva shot off-target with the goal gaping after [[Fernando Muslera]]'s mistake, with Cavani seeming to pick up an injury in the scramble. The match finished 2\u20131 to Uruguay and Portugal were eliminated from the tournament.\n\n===2018\u201319 UEFA Nations League===\nFollowing the World Cup, Portugal took part in the inaugural [[2018\u201319 UEFA Nations League|UEFA Nations League]], where the ''Sele\u00e7\u00e3o'' were placed in [[2018\u201319 UEFA Nations League A|League A]] and drawn into [[2018\u201319 UEFA Nations League A#Group 3|Group 3]] with Italy and Poland.

In the second half of the match, Bernardo Silva scored Portugal's third goal of the match. Poland did not give up, and [[Jakub Blaszczykowski]] managed to reduce to the home team with a shot from outside the box. Despite this, the Portuguese managed to maintain the advantage and secure a victory by the score of 3\u20132, consolidating the leadership of their group.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.uefa.com/uefanationsleague/season=2019/teams/player=250059115/statistics/|title=Bernardo Silva |website=UEFA.com|publisher=Union of European Football Associations|accessdate=26 February 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.uefa.com/uefanationsleague/season=2019/matches/round=2000959/match=2024021/index.html|title=Poland vs Portugal |website=UEFA.com|publisher=Union of European Football Associations|date=11 October 2018|accessdate=26 February 2019}}</ref> \n\n[[File:Gon\u00e7alo Guedes (cropped).jpg|thumb|left|220px|[[Gon\u00e7alo Guedes]], who scored the winning goal against the [[Netherlands national football team|Netherlands]] in the [[2019 UEFA Nations League Final]]]]\nIn Portugal's third match, they once again faced Italy, this time in [[Milan]].

Although the Swiss started the game with more scoring opportunities, it was Portugal who opened the scoring with a free-kick from Cristiano Ronaldo. In the 57th minute, Bernardo Silva was fouled in the penalty area and the match official immediately called a penalty for the Portuguese. However, the team responsible for the VAR drew attention to a move that occurred earlier, in which [[N\u00e9lson Semedo]] appeared to have touched [[Steven Zuber]] in the Portuguese area. After a bid review, referee [[Felix Brych]] gave a penalty to Switzerland, leading [[Ricardo Rodr\u00edguez (footballer)|Ricardo Rodr\u00edguez]] to score the equalizer. The prospect of extra time would become more real until the 88th minute, when R\u00faben Neves pitched the ball to Bernardo Silva, who gave the ball to Cristiano Ronaldo to score Portugal's second goal. Two minutes later, Ronaldo scored his third goal of the game, completing a hat-trick and securing the hosts a spot in [[2019 UEFA Nations League Final|the final]].

The national team, also referred to as ''Sele\u00e7\u00e3o das [[Coat of arms of Portugal#Quinas|Quinas]]'' (Selection of the Quinas), represents the nation of [[Portugal]] in international [[association football|football]]. It is fielded by the [[Portuguese Football Federation]] and competes as one of the foundig memn of [[UEFA]].\n\nThe [[Portugal national football team]] has played its first international match until 1921 and also took part in the [[FIFA World Cup]], where their best finish was third in [[1966 FIFA World Cup|1966]]. Despite reaching the final of the [[2004 UEFA European Football Championship|UEFA Euro 2004]] at home soil, with their [[golden generation]], Portugal won its first major trophy in 2016 the [[2016 UEFA European Football Championship|UEFA Euro 2016]], which was followed by the inaugural [[2018\u201319 UEFA Nations League|UEFA Nations League]] in 2019, making it the second major tournament earned by the Portuguese in three finals.\n\n==Early years==\nThe [[Portuguese Football Federation]] was formed in 1914 under the '''[[Portuguese Football Union]]''' name (by 1926, they changed to its current name) and the aim of creating national tournaments (since it only existed regional championships) and promoting games in which a Portuguese representative team would play against other teams from various parts of the globe, but unfortunately, due to the [[World War I]], the dream was not made possible for the next seven years.\n\nPortugal's first game was on 18 December 1921. The game ended in a defeat for the national team, 3\u20131. The following year, the inaugural edition of the ''[[Ta\u00e7a de Portugal|Campeonato de Portugal]]'' (a knock-out tournament, precursor of the ''[[Ta\u00e7a de Portugal]]'') was contested, the winner was defined as the \"Portuguese Champion\".\n\n==1928 Olympic Tournament==\nAfter years of playing friendly games, Portugal was invited to enter the [[Football at the 1928 Summer Olympics|1928 Summer Olympics Football Tournament]], which was, at that time, contested by the best national \"A\" teams in the world and, therefore, considered to be the best international footballing tournament until the [[FIFA World Cup]] started, two years later, in 1930.\n\nThe Portuguese team was drawn in the preliminary round against [[Chile national football team|Chile]] for a place in the first round. After falling 2\u20130 behind, Portugal scored four goals, winning the game 4\u20132. After their win against Chile, they faced off [[Yugoslavia national football team|Yugoslavia]] and won 2\u20131 thanks to a late goal in the 90th minute.\n\n[[Egypt national football team|Egypt]] was the team that followed in the quarter-finals. Here the Portuguese adventure ended after a 2\u20131 defeat. In the following games, the Egyptians lost against [[Argentina national football team|Argentina]] (6\u20130) in the semi-final and [[Italy national football team|Italy]] (11\u20133) for the bronze medal match, which embittered the players. Nevertheless, it was a bright start in international tournaments for the team.\n\n==Early World Cup attempts==\nPortugal was not invited to the [[1930 FIFA World Cup|1930 World Cup]], which only featured a final stage and no [[FIFA World Cup qualification|qualification round]]. The team took part in the [[1934 FIFA World Cup qualification]], but failed to eliminate their Spanish opponents, aggregating two defeats in the two-legged round, with a 9\u20130 loss in [[Madrid]] and 2\u20131 loss in [[Lisbon]] for an aggregate score of 11\u20131.\n\nIn the [[1938 FIFA World Cup qualification]], the ''Sele\u00e7\u00e3o'' played one game against [[Switzerland national football team|Switzerland]] in a neutral ground, held in [[Milan]], losing 2\u20131 against the Swiss, ending qualification prospects. Because of the international conflict due to the [[World War II]], there was no World Cup held until the [[1950 FIFA World Cup|1950 competition]] and subsequently, the national team made very few games against other teams. A 10\u20130 away friendly defeat against [[England national football team|England]], two years after the war, was the proof of how the irregularity of the games had taken its effects on the squad.\n\n==1950s and early 1960s==\nOn the restart of games, the team [[1950 FIFA World Cup qualification#Group 6|was to play]] a two-legged round against Spain, just like in the 1934 qualification. After a 5\u20131 defeat in Madrid, they managed to draw in the second game 2\u20132 and so the qualification ended with a 7\u20133 aggregate score.\n\nFor the [[1954 FIFA World Cup qualification (UEFA - Group 5/Group 6/Group 9)#Group 5|qualification of the 1954 World Cup]], the team played [[Austria national football team|Austria]]. The Austrians won the first game with a humiliating 9\u20131 result. The best the national team could do was hold the team to a goalless draw in Lisbon, and the round ended with a 9\u20131 defeat.\n\nIn the [[1958 FIFA World Cup qualification (UEFA - Group 8)|1958 qualification]], Portugal finished last in the group stage that also featured [[Northern Ireland national football team|Northern Ireland]] and Italy; only the first-placed team would qualify. They started with a 1\u20131 draw against the Irish team, but lost in [[Belfast]] by a score of 3\u20130. After that, they won 3\u20130 against Italy and lost 3\u20130 in Milan. Finishing with three points, they were two points behind group winners Northern Ireland.\n\nThe year 1960 was the year that UEFA created the [[UEFA European Football Championship|European Football Championship]], a football tournament similar to the FIFA World Cup, but for European nations. The [[Euro 1960|first edition]] was a knock-out tournament, the last four teams participating in final stage that only featured one leg while the older stages had two legs. For the first round, the ''Sele\u00e7\u00e3o das Quinas'' won 2\u20130 against [[East Germany national football team|East Germany]] and 3\u20132 in [[Porto]] for the second leg, finishing with a 5\u20132 two-legged win. The quarter-final opponent was Yugoslavia. Despite winning the first game 2\u20131, they lost the second leg 5\u20131 in [[Belgrade]], and lost 6\u20133 on aggregate.\n\nEngland and [[Luxembourg national football team|Luxembourg]] were the [[1962 FIFA World Cup qualification (UEFA - Group 6)|1962 FIFA World Cup qualification]] adversaries of the national team. Portugal ended second in the group with three points, behind England (with seven points). They started well with a home win (6\u20130) against Luxembourg and a home draw (1\u20131) against the English, but lost the following games, first 4\u20132 against Luxembourg, then 2\u20130 against England. Like in the previous World Cup qualification, only the first in the group would qualify.\n\nThe [[Euro 1964|1964 European Championship]] shared the same format as the 1960 edition. Portugal played against [[Bulgaria national football team|Bulgaria]] in the first round. The Portuguese lost 3\u20131 in [[Sofia]] and won 3\u20131 in Lisbon. With the round tied 4\u20134, a replay was needed in a neutral ground. In [[Rome]], Portugal lost 1\u20130 with a late goal from the Bulgarians.\n\nIn 1964, the [[Ta\u00e7a das Na\u00e7\u00f5es|Nations' Cup]] was held in [[Brazil]]. The event celebrated the 50th anniversary of the founding of the Brazilian Football Confederation. Three international teams were invited \u2013 Argentina, Portugal, and England \u2013 for the competition, which was played in [[Rio de Janeiro]] and [[S\u00e3o Paulo]] in late May and early June, with an all [[Round-robin tournament|round-robin]] format. Portugal ended with one point (five behind winners Argentina) and joint third place with England after two defeats (4\u20131 with Brazil and 2\u20130 with Argentina) and a 1\u20131 tie against England\n\n==1966 World Cup and 1970s==\n{{main|Os Magri\u00e7os}}\nIn the [[1966 FIFA World Cup qualification (UEFA - Group 4)|1966 World Cup qualification]], Portugal was drawn into the same group as [[Czechoslovakia national football team|Czechoslovakia]], [[Romania national football team|Romania]], and [[Turkey national football team|Turkey]]. They topped the group with only one draw and one defeat in all six games and finally qualified for a FIFA World Cup; that year the final stage would be held in England. Notable results were 1\u20130 away wins against Czechoslovakia and Turkey and a 5\u20131 home win against the Turks.\n\nThe team started out with three wins in the group stage, where they were in Group C, against [[Hungary national football team|Hungary]] 3\u20131, Bulgaria 3\u20130, and two-time defending champions [[Brazil national football team|Brazil]] 3\u20131. In the quarter-finals, Portugal played against [[North Korea national football team|North Korea]]. Portugal won the game with four goals from [[Eus\u00e9bio]] overturning a deficit of 3\u20130. Later, they reached the semi-finals but were defeated by hosts and eventual champions England 2\u20131; in this game, Portugal would have played in [[Liverpool]], but as England were the hosts, FIFA decided that the game should be in [[London]], which led the Portuguese team to travel unexpectedly from Liverpool to London. Portugal then defeated the [[USSR national football team|Soviet Union]] 2\u20131 in the third place match for their best World Cup finish to date. Eus\u00e9bio was the top scorer of the World Cup, with nine goals.\n[[File:Eusebio Portugal.JPG|177px|thumb|left|Eus\u00e9bio in 1972]]\n\nFor the [[UEFA Euro 1968 qualifying#Group 2|Euro 1968 qualifying]], the ''Sele\u00e7\u00e3o'' played against Bulgaria, [[Norway national football team|Norway]], and [[Sweden national football team|Sweden]]. They finished second to Bulgaria, with six points, four behind the Bulgarians. Portugal only managed two wins and two draws; both wins came from 2\u20131 results against Norway.\n\nAfter their tremendous success in the 1966 World Cup, Portugal [[FIFA World Cup qualification#Group 1|tried to qualify]] for the [[1970 FIFA World Cup|1970 World Cup]], which was to be held in [[Mexico]]. They finished fourth and last in their group, behind [[Greece national football team|Greece]], Romania, and Switzerland. With only four points (from one win and two ties), Portugal were four points behind group winners Romania.\n\nTo be able to participate in [[UEFA Euro 1972|Euro 1972]], Portugal had to win its [[UEFA Euro 1972 qualifying#Group 5|group that comprised]] the teams of [[Belgium national football team|Belgium]], [[Denmark national football team|Denmark]], and [[Scotland national football team|Scotland]]. Portugal finished second to Belgium with seven points (two less than the Belgians). The three wins the Portuguese had were against Denmark (1\u20130 away, 5\u20130 home) and Scotland in a 2\u20130 home win.\n\nAlso in 1972, Portugal participated in the [[Brazilian Independence Cup]], a tournament that marked the 150th birthday since [[Brazil]] [[Brazilian independence|received its independence from Portugal]]. Winning both group stages (in the first stage, with wins against [[Ecuador national football team|Ecuador]] (3\u20130), [[Iran national football team|Iran]] (3\u20130), Chile (4\u20131) and the [[Republic of Ireland national football team|Republic of Ireland]] (2\u20131) and in the second stage winning against Argentina (3\u20131), drawing [[Uruguay national football team|Uruguay]] (1\u20131) and a 2\u20131 win over the Soviet Union) they qualified for the final with Brazil at the [[Maracan\u00e3 (stadium)|Est\u00e1dio do Maracan\u00e3]]. The Brazilian star [[Jairzinho]] scored in the 89th minute to give Brazil the win.\n\nFor the [[1974 FIFA World Cup qualification (UEFA)#Group 6|1974 qualification stages]], Portugal were placed in an accessible group, but were unable to defeat Bulgaria (2-2) in the decisive match, thus not qualifying. The only country Portugal managed to defeat was [[Cyprus national football team|Cyprus]], winning 4\u20130 and 1\u20130 in [[Nicosia]]. Portugal faced tough competition from the strong [[Poland national football team|Poland]] team to claim the spot that would ensure them a place in the [[1978 FIFA World Cup]] held in [[Argentina]]. They finished second place, behind Poland.\n\n==Late 1970s until early 1990s==\n[[UEFA Euro 1980 qualifying Group 2|The national team was put]] alongside Austria, Belgium, Norway, and Scotland to fight for the first spot in the group, which would allow them to go to the final stage of [[UEFA Euro 1980]]. With nine points, Portugal took third place, three points behind first-placed Belgium. Out of their four wins, the most important were the away win against second-placed Austria (2\u20131) and a home win against Scotland (1\u20130).\n\nFor the [[1982 FIFA World Cup qualification (UEFA)#UEFA Group 6|1982 qualification]] the Portuguese team had to face [[Israel national football team|Israel]], Northern Ireland, Scotland and Sweden for the top two group places. Portugal finished in fourth place with seven points, less four than the first, with wins over group winners Scotland (2\u20131), second-placed Northern Ireland (1\u20130) and last-placed Israel (3\u20130), all in home ground.\n\nDuring [[UEFA Euro 1984 qualifying#Group 2|the campaign for Euro 1984]], Portugal  had to play with [[Finland national football team|Finland]], [[Poland national football team|Poland]] and, highly favourites, Soviet Union. Portugal won the group with a dramatic win over USSR in the last game by a score of 1\u20130 in home ground. With ten points and five wins, the Portuguese had beaten the Soviet Union by one point.\n\nPortugal ended in group B, alongside Spain, West Germany and Romania. In the first two games, they tied 0\u20130 and 1\u20131 against [[West Germany national football team|West Germany]] and Spain, respectively. A 1\u20130 win over Romania gave them second place in the group, which was enough to go through to the knockout stage. [[S.L. Benfica|Benfica]]'s [[Nen\u00e9 (footballer, born 1949)|Tamagnini Nen\u00e9]] scored the winner.\n\nThey played against the hosts, [[France national football team|France]], and eventual champions, in one of the most exciting matches in European Championship history. France scored first, but Portugal equalised almost an hour later. The game was tied after 90 minutes and went into extra time. Portugal made the score 2\u20131 in the first 15 minutes, with both teams having numerous quality scoring chances. In the second half of extra time, France scored in the 114th and 119th minutes to eliminate Portugal 3\u20132 and go through to the final.\n\n[[1986 FIFA World Cup qualification (UEFA)#Group 2|For the 1986 tournament]], the ''Selec\u00e7\u00e3o'' played against Czechoslovakia, [[Malta national football team|Malta]], Sweden, and West Germany for the two spots that would guarantee them a ticket to Mexico. Needing a win in the last game against West Germany in [[Stuttgart]], manager [[Jos\u00e9 Augusto Torres|Jos\u00e9 Torres]] famously said to the press, after being severally doubted that his team would qualify for Mexico 1986, \"Let me dream!\" Portugal went on to win the game 1\u20130 to become the first team to beat West Germany at their home ground in an official match.\n\nPortugal was a fan-favourite to make a good campaign because of their [[UEFA Euro 1984]] tournament. The team exited early in the group stages after a win and two losses. They started with a 1\u20130 win to England. Later, they were beaten by Poland and [[Morocco national football team|Morocco]], 1\u20130 and 3\u20131, respectively. Their staying in Mexico was marked by a doping case, an injured player and, most significantly, by the [[Saltillo affair]], where players refused to train in order to win more prizes from the Football Federation.\n\nWanting to keep present at the major international football tournaments, the Portuguese team attempted to top their [[UEFA Euro 1988 qualifying#Group 2|qualifying group]] in a tight group with favourites Italy, Malta, Sweden and Switzerland. Still, they only managed to win two games in a total of eight disputed, ending in third with eight points, five behind first-placed Italy. Both games were won away from home, in [[Malta]] (1\u20130) and in Sweden against second-placed team (also 1\u20130).[[File:Luis Figo.jpg|190px|thumb|right|[[Lu\u00eds Figo]] playing for Portugal at the [[2006 FIFA World Cup]]]]\n\nThe [[1990 FIFA World Cup qualification - UEFA Group 7|1990 World Cup qualification]] was widely seen as a possibility to go back to the international stage. Along with Belgium, Czechoslovakia, Luxembourg and Switzerland, Portugal fought until the last game to get one of the first two spots of the group. Playing at home against Czechoslovakia, they failed to score and the game ended in a 0-0 allowing the East Europeans to get the second place with twelve points (the same as winners Belgium) with two points ahead of Portugal, who came with the first place. Notable results are the wins against Switzerland, 3\u20131 in Portugal and 2\u20131 in [[Neuch\u00e2tel]].\n\nDuring the draws for the [[UEFA Euro 1992 qualifying Group 6|Euro 1992 qualifying]], [[Netherlands national football team|the Netherlands]] was seen as the strongest team besides Portugal. Greece, Finland and Malta were the other teams. With five wins and eleven points, the Portuguese ended second behind the Dutch, who had two more points than Portugal. A famous result in this campaign was the 1\u20130 home win against the Dutch.\n\nThey participated in the friendly [[1992 U.S. Cup]] along with the host, USA, Italy and Ireland in a round robin tournament. Portugal finished last with one point (six behind winners United States) from a draw with Italy (0\u20130). The other two games were defeats with USA (1\u20130) and the Republic of Ireland (2\u20130).\n\nFor the [[1994 FIFA World Cup qualification (UEFA)#Group 1|\u201994 World Cup qualification]], Portugal played in the same group as [[Estonia national football team|Estonia]], Italy, Malta, Scotland and Switzerland for the two highest places. They disappointed, ending in third with 14 points and six wins, just two points behind winners Italy and one behind second-placed Switzerland. In the last game of the round, Portugal were defeated by Italy in Milan. The ''Selec\u00e7\u00e3o'' managed to win 1\u20130 against Switzerland and 5\u20130 against the Scots, both were home wins. The then manager, [[Carlos Queiroz]], blamed the Football Federation for this failure, saying, \"They should clean the mess that the Federation has.\"\n\n==Golden generation==\nPortugal was invited to play at the [[SkyDome Cup]] in [[Toronto]], [[Canada]] against the then-European champions Denmark and [[Canada men's national soccer team|Canada]]. With a draw against the Canadians (1\u20131) and a win against the Danes, Portugal went on to win the trophy, which was their first win at senior level.\n\n[[UEFA Euro 1996 qualifying#Group6|Portugal managed to reach]] the Euro 1996, by topping their group with twenty-three points, six more than second-placed Republic of Ireland. Their group consisted of [[Austria national football team|Austria]], [[Latvia national football team|Latvia]], [[Liechtenstein national football team|Liechtenstein]], Northern Ireland and Republic of Ireland.\n\nIn the final tournament, Portugal drew 1\u20131 with European Champions Denmark, won 1\u20130 to Turkey and 3\u20130 against [[Croatia national football team|Croatia]], finishing first in their group. In the quarter-finals, they lost 1\u20130 to eventual runners-up [[Czech Republic national football team|Czech Republic]], due to a marvelous [[Karel Poborsk\u00fd]] second-half lob over goalkeeper [[V\u00edtor Ba\u00eda]]. This marked the beginning of the [[Golden Generation]], a group of youngsters who had won the [[FIFA U-20 World Cup]] in [[1989 FIFA World Youth Championship|1989]] and [[1991 FIFA World Youth Championship|1991]] and were now leading the national senior squad.\n\nThe team [[1998 FIFA World Cup qualification (UEFA)#Group 9|almost qualified for the tournament]] that was to be hosted by [[France]]. However, during a qualifier in [[Germany national football team|Germany]], [[Rui Costa]] was sent off by French referee [[Marc Batta]] for taking too long to walk off the field while Portugal was leading 1\u20130. Germany drew the crucial game and was thus able to qualify. This incident is regarded as one of the darkest in Portugal's football history,{{citation needed|date=April 2014}} with FIFA being accused of favouritism in support of Germany, who were the defending Euro '96 champions. The group was made of [[Albania national football team|Albania]], [[Armenia national football team|Armenia]], Germany, Northern Ireland and [[Ukraine national football team|Ukraine]], Portugal ended in third place with 19 points and six wins. Germany finished first with 22 points and Ukraine with twenty, with the Slavics winning a place in the final play-offs. Portugal tied both games with Germany (0\u20130 home and 1\u20131 away).\n\nIn the [[UEFA Euro 2000 qualifying#Group 7|qualifications for the 2000 Euro]], Portugal faced [[Azerbaijan national football team|Azerbaijan]], Hungary, Liechtenstein, Romania and [[Slovakia national football team|Slovakia]]. Portugal gained twenty-three points, just one short of first place Romania, with seven wins. Having not qualified directly into the event, the Portuguese team had the best performance by any runner-up and therefore qualified for the final tournament.\n\nCaptained by [[Fernando Couto]] in the [[Euro 2000|final stage]], they defeated England (3\u20132, recovering from a 2\u20130 disadvantage), Romania (1\u20130) with a late header from [[Costinha]] in [[injury time]], and Germany (3\u20130, from a [[S\u00e9rgio Concei\u00e7\u00e3o]] hat-trick), the last one using the B team, since they were already qualified in first of the group after the other two games, to finish atop their group and then defeated Turkey in the quarter-finals (2\u20130, with both goals from [[Nuno Gomes]]).\n\nIn the semi-final meeting with World Cup holders France, Portugal scored first and nearly scored again due to a [[Jo\u00e3o Vieira Pinto|Jo\u00e3o Pinto]]'s header after France equalised. Portugal were eliminated in extra time by a [[golden goal]] when [[Zinedine Zidane]] converted a [[Penalty kick (association football)|penalty]]. [[Austria]]n referee [[Gunter Benko]] awarded the spot kick for a handball after Abel Xavier blocked a shot from [[Sylvain Wiltord]] (Benko initially gave France a corner but changed his mind after consulting with [[Slovakia|Slovak]] linesman Igor Sramka). Xavier, Nuno Gomes (one of the top scorers in the tournament with four goals), and [[Paulo Bento]] were all given lengthy suspensions for shoving the referee.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/euro2000/teams/portugal/default.stm |title=BBC SPORT &#124; EURO2000 &#124; PORTUGAL |publisher=[[BBC News]] |date=2000-07-03 |accessdate=2016-07-31}}</ref> The final result was 2\u20131.\n\nDuring the [[2002 FIFA World Cup qualification - UEFA Group 2|World Cup 2002 qualification]], Portugal made a crucial win against the Netherlands (2\u20130 in [[Rotterdam]]) and ties against Republic of Ireland (1\u20131 in both games) and the Netherlands (2\u20132), in Porto, after falling 2\u20130 behind and scoring in the dying minutes of the game. Portugal won the group with seven wins and three ties with no defeats and 24 points (the same as the Republic of Ireland), but with a better goal average.\n\nWhile the 2002 World Cup qualifying stage was unusually smooth, several problems and poor judgment decisions occurred during the preparation and tournament itself \u2013 shopping sprees by players, this time in [[Macau]], were widely reported in the Portuguese press. Questionable managing choices and some amateurism, including the same lack of agreement on prizes. [[V\u00edtor Ba\u00eda]] replaced in-form [[Ricardo (footballer, born 1976)|Ricardo]] in [[Goalkeeper (association football)|goal]], [[Roberto Severo|Beto]] played out of position at [[right back]], [[Lu\u00eds Figo]] was in very poor physical condition, and [[Hugo Viana]] was called as a last-minute replacement for [[Daniel Kenedy]] (who tested positive in a [[Use of performance-enhancing drugs in sport|doping]] control test) \u2013 as Portugal underachieved and ended third in its group stage, subsequently eliminated. The manager [[Ant\u00f3nio Lu\u00eds Alves Ribeiro Oliveira|Oliveira]] was fired after the World Cup.\n\nPortugal entered the tournament as favourites to win Group D. However, they were upset 3\u20132 by the [[United States men's national soccer team|United States]], at one point being three goals down in the match. They then rebounded with a 4\u20130 smashing Poland, with [[Pauleta]] netting a [[hat-trick]].\n\nNeeding a draw to advance, they lost the final group game to hosts [[South Korea national football team|South Korea]]. [[Argentina|Argentine]] referee [[\u00c1ngel S\u00e1nchez (referee)|\u00c1ngel S\u00e1nchez]] sent off [[Jo\u00e3o Vieira Pinto]] for a tackle on [[Park Ji-Sung]].

On the preparation, the Football Federation made a contract with [[Luiz Felipe Scolari]] to manage the team until the tournament ended. Despite the disappointed friendly matches, the Portuguese team entered the tournament being a favourite to win it.\n\n[[File:Portugiesische Fans bei der Euro 2004.jpg|left|thumb|260px|Portuguese fans supporting the national team]]\nThe host nation lost the first game against Greece 1\u20132, an upset. They got their first win against [[Russia national football team|Russia]] 2\u20130 and also beat a strong Spain side 1\u20130, with the latter eventually knocked out in the group stages.\n\nThey went through and went on to play against England, in an entertaining 2\u20132 draw that went into penalties, where [[Ricardo (footballer, born 1976)|Ricardo]] proved decisive, with an epic attitude taking off his goalkeeping gloves, saving a penalty and scoring right after the winner himself. Portugal beat the Netherlands 2\u20131 in the semi-final with a [[Maniche]] strike from outside the box. They were eventually beaten by heavy underdog outsiders Greece 1\u20130, credited to [[Striker (association football)|striker]] [[Angelos Charisteas]], marking the first time in the history of the competition that the final featured the same two teams as the opening match. The match was considered a dominant win for Greece.\n\nAfter the tournament ended, a lot of players belonging to the ''Gera\u00e7\u00e3o de Ouro'' (Golden Generation), abandoned their international footballing careers, with only [[Lu\u00eds Figo]] remaining in the team, despite a temporary retirement. The only silver lining for Portugal was the emergence of Cristiano Ronaldo as a key player, who had just signed for Manchester United and had been a real revelation. Ronaldo scored two goals and was selected in the UEFA Euro All Stars Team. He would go on to become the captain of the national side after the retirement of Luis Figo. While Portugal was playing in the competition, Scolari agreed in a new two-year deal with the Federation.\n\nPortugal finished first in the [[2006 FIFA World Cup qualification - UEFA Group 3|qualifying round for the 2006 World Cup]] with 30 points, nine games won, three draws, and no defeats. The second-placed Russia finished with seven points less. The ''Sele\u00e7\u00e3o'' played with Estonia, Latvia, Liechtenstein, Luxembourg, Russia, and Slovakia.\n\nPortugal finished first place in Group D of the World Cup finals, with victories over [[Angola national football team|Angola]] (1\u20130, goal from Pauleta, the leading goalscorer in the [[2006 FIFA World Cup qualification|World Cup qualifiers]]), Iran (2\u20130, scored by [[Deco]], and [[Cristiano Ronaldo]]) and [[Mexico national football team|Mexico]] (2\u20131, goals from [[Maniche]] and [[Sim\u00e3o Sabrosa|Sim\u00e3o]]). Only Mexico's [[Francisco Fonseca]] was able to score against Portugal.\n\nThe Netherlands lost to Portugal 1\u20130 in the Round of 16 on 25 June in [[Frankenstadion|Nuremberg]]. The only goal came courtesy of a Maniche strike in an acrimonious match marked by 16 yellow cards, with four players ([[Khalid Boulahrouz]], [[Costinha]], [[Deco]], and [[Giovanni van Bronckhorst]]) being sent off. (See the [[Battle of Nuremberg (association football)|Battle of Nuremberg]].)\n[[File:Charisteas' Siegtreffer im Finale der Euro 2004.jpg|250px|thumb|right|Portugal lost the [[UEFA Euro 2004]] final by 1\u20130.]]\n\nOn 1 July at [[Veltins-Arena|Gelsenkirchen]], Portugal drew 0\u20130 after extra-time with England, but won 3\u20131 on [[Penalty shootout (association football)|penalties]] to reach their first World Cup semi-final since 1966. Cristiano Ronaldo scored the winning penalty. The game was marred by a violent challenge on Portuguese defender [[Ricardo Carvalho]] by England's [[Wayne Rooney]], which resulted in him being sent off. Cristiano Ronaldo was accused by England fans to have influenced the referee's decision to send Rooney off despite the two of them being teammates at Manchester United.\n\nPortugal lost 1\u20130 against France in the semi-finals on 5 July at [[Allianz Arena|Munich]]. Two players had been forced to sit out due to accumulated bookings from the round of 16 and quarter-finals. It did not help that the team faced a hostile crowd of English and French fans; they relentlessly booed Ronaldo for his perceived unsportsmanlike behavior in the previous round. As in the semi-finals of Euro 2000, Portugal were narrowly defeated by France, with the decisive goal being a penalty scored by [[Zinedine Zidane]] after [[Thierry Henry]] was awarded a penalty from a foul committed by Ricardo Carvalho.\n\nPortugal faced Germany in the third place play-off match on 8 July in [[Gottlieb-Daimler-Stadion|Stuttgart]]. The match was notable for being Pauleta's last game for the national team so as captain [[Lu\u00eds Figo]]'s last before retirement from international football \u2013 though, surprisingly, he was not selected to start the game, coming on as a substitute near the end and setting up Portugal's goal in a 3\u20131 defeat. All three German goals had the direct participation of [[Bastian Schweinsteiger]], who scored twice and had another shot turned into an own goal by Portugal's [[Petit (Portuguese footballer)|Petit]]. Ultimately, the team won the \"Most Entertaining Team\" award for their play during the World Cup, in an award always organized through public participation in a poll. Cristiano Ronaldo missed out on the U-23 Player of the Tournament award and it was believed that FIFA's decision was influenced due to hate mail from supporters of England who were still upset with Ronaldo's part in getting Rooney sent off in the quarter - final stage. Once again Scolari was asked to accept a new deal with the Federation that would maintain with as the manager until the end of the next competition.\n\n==Euro 2008==\n\nAfter the successes of the Euro 2004 and the 2006 FIFA World Cup, Portugal was seen as a major contender to win the [[Euro 2008]], but [[UEFA Euro 2008 qualifying Group A|their qualification]] wasn't easy. The national team faced some problems in the last games, in addition, Scolari was suspended for three games, being substituted by his assistant manager. Portugal ended with seven wins and twenty-seven points (one less than first-placed Poland). Armenia. Azerbaijan, Belgium, Finland, [[Kazakhstan national football team|Kazakhstan]], Poland and Serbia were the opponents. With important triumphs against Azerbaijan (2\u20130 in [[Baku]]), Kazakhstan (2\u20131 in [[Almaty]]) and Belgium (4\u20130 in Lisbon and 2\u20131 in [[Brussels]]), they managed to qualify for the final stage.\n\nThe Portuguese team was a featured part of TV network [[ESPN]]s ad campaign promoting their coverage of the [[UEFA Euro 2008]] tournament.{{citation needed|date=July 2012}} The first game was against Turkey and it was won 2\u20130, with first-ever scoring achievements for internationals [[Pepe (footballer born 1983)|Pepe]] and [[Raul Meireles]]. Their second game was against the Czech Republic, a 3\u20131 success. With assured qualification to the knockout stage, as first in group A, they played with the reserve team against Switzerland, and lost 2\u20130, with two [[Hakan Yakin|Hakan Yak\u0131n]] goals. During the group stage, Scolari announced to the squad that it would be his last spell as the Portuguese manager, ending a five-year era full of prosperity.\n\nOn 19 June 2008, Portugal played against Germany, and were beaten 2\u20133 after falling behind 0\u20132 within the first half an hour. Portugal proceeded to score, followed by another Germany goal, a [[Michael Ballack]] header. Portugal scored a consolation goal in the final minutes of normal time, courtesy of [[H\u00e9lder Postiga]], but was eventually knocked out of Euro 2008 at the quarterfinal stage.\n\n==2010 FIFA World Cup==\nPortugal [[2010 FIFA World Cup qualification - UEFA Group 1|participated in the qualifying stages]] with manager [[Carlos Queiroz]] for the [[2010 FIFA World Cup]], which took place in [[South Africa]]. The team had a qualifying campaign that almost turned disastrous and just sneaked into second place by a single point over [[Sweden national football team|Sweden]], a group where [[Denmark national football team|Denmark]] finished first, one point ahead from Portugal. Portugal was drawn to play against [[Bosnia and Herzegovina national football team|Bosnia and Herzegovina]] in the [[2010 FIFA World Cup qualification - UEFA Second Round|European zone play-offs]]. With two wins (1\u20130 in the first leg, in Lisbon; and 1\u20130, in [[Zenica]]), the team gained its right to participate in the World Cup. Having qualified for the 2010 FIFA World Cup, the ''Sele\u00e7\u00e3o das Quinas'' had its most successful decade to date, having qualified for all of the World Cups and Euro Cups (Euro 2000, World Cup 2002, Euro 2004, World Cup 2006, Euro 2008, and World Cup 2010), along with [[Spain national football team|Spain]], [[Italy national football team|Italy]], [[Germany national football team|Germany]], and [[France national football team|France]], the only other four teams to have done so. \n[[File:FIFA World Cup 2010 Portugal North Korea7.jpg|right|thumb|300px|Portuguese players celebrating a goal against North Korea on 21 June 2010]]\nIn the final draw, on 4 December 2009, Portugal was drawn in one of the toughest groups, the so-called ''[[Group of Death]]'' where the ''Sele\u00e7\u00e3o das Quinas'' faced 5-time champions [[Brazil National Football Team|Brazil]], [[Africa]]'s top contenders [[Ivory Coast national football team|Ivory Coast]] and [[1966 FIFA World Cup|1966]] opponents [[North Korea national football team|North Korea]].\n\nPortugal faced [[Ivory Coast national football team|Ivory Coast]] in their opening match on 15 June 2010 at the [[Nelson Mandela Bay Stadium]] in [[Port Elizabeth]] and the game ended in a goalless draw. Their next match was against North Korea on 21 June 2010 at the [[Cape Town Stadium]] in [[Cape Town]] in which Portugal won by 7\u20130. Their last match in the group stage against Brazil on 25 June 2010 at the [[Moses Mabhida Stadium]] in [[Durban]] ended in a goalless 0\u20130 while both teams advanced to the knockout stage. Portugal was on a 19 match undefeated streak, conceding only 3 goals. The Portuguese defence ended being broken by Spain's [[David Villa]]'s goal which defeated Portugal in the round of 16, 1\u20130.\n\nDuring the Tournament, Queiroz was frequently criticised for setting up the team in an overly cautious way. The team's style of play was to keep the team well closed in the back, while sending direct balls up to the front, most notably to a lonely [[Cristiano Ronaldo]], whose mission seemed to be to run at the opposition's defence and try long shots to take advantage of the tricky [[Adidas Jabulani|Jabulani]]. This approach was widely criticised, with an outburst coming from [[Deco]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.record.xl.pt/arquivo/interior.aspx?content_id=446356 |title=Pesquisa por - Jornal Record |website=Record.xl.pt |date= |accessdate=2016-07-31}}</ref> as well as implied from [[Cristiano Ronaldo]]'s reply to a post-game comment after the defeat against Spain. When asked about the team's performances, he answered with a dry \"You can go ask Queiroz\".\n\nThe direct football style was perceived as not taking full advantage of the Portuguese midfield, filled with top-flight players such as [[Cristiano Ronaldo]], [[Deco]], [[Raul Meireles]], [[Sim\u00e3o Sabrosa|Sim\u00e3o]], where a creative possession-based football had been the basis of the team in the preceding years. Although the team reached their base objective of getting past the group phase, and lost out to the eventual world champions, there was a palpable feeling that the team could have gone further had the coach been more ambitious.\n\nA few months after the World Cup, and just days before the beginning of the Euro 2012 Qualifiers, squad regulars Sim\u00e3o, [[Paulo Ferreira]], and [[Miguel Monteiro|Miguel]] all retired from international duty, stating they wanted to focus entirely on their respective clubs. In January 2011, a few weeks before the friendly match against [[Argentina national football team|Argentina]], midfielder [[Tiago Mendes|Tiago]] also retired from international football at just 29 years of age, stating personal reasons.\n\n==Euro 2012==\nAs [[Carlos Queiroz]] suffered from criticism regarding the World Cup, he was also banned from coaching the national team for one month after an investigation concluded that he tried to block a doping test to the team while preparing for the World Cup in Portugal, as well as directing insulting words to the testers.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.record.xl.pt/Futebol/selecoes//interior.aspx?content_id=457989 |title=Sele\u00e7\u00f5es - Jornal Record |website=Record.xl.pt |date= |accessdate=2016-07-31}}</ref> In consequence, he received a further six-month suspension. This meant that Queiroz was not able to select the players or lead the team for the first two Euro 2012 qualifiers against [[Cyprus national football team|Cyprus]] and [[Norway national football team|Norway]]. In the sequence of these events, Portugal drew 4\u20134 against Cyprus at home, followed by a 1\u20130 defeat at the hands of Norway, placing the team in a difficult position right from the start. That prompted several media outbursts from Queiroz<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.record.xl.pt/Futebol/selecoes//interior.aspx?content_id=458171 |title=Sele\u00e7\u00f5es - Jornal Record |website=Record.xl.pt |date= |accessdate=2016-07-31}}</ref> against the heads of the Portuguese Football Federation, which then prompted his dismissal as the head of the team.\n[[File:Portugal national football team 20120609.jpg|220px|thumb|left|Portugal at the [[UEFA Euro 2012]]]]\n\nIn reaction to this dismissal, and in face of impending failure to qualify for [[UEFA Euro 2012]], missing out to the first major final stage since the [[1998 FIFA World Cup|1998 World Cup]], the Federation's president, Gilberto Mada\u00edl, traveled to [[Madrid]] in a bid to persuade superstar [[Real Madrid C.F.|Real Madrid]] manager [[Jos\u00e9 Mourinho]] to lead his nation's team for the matches against [[Denmark national football team|Denmark]] and [[Iceland national football team|Iceland]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://aeiou.expresso.pt/madail-quer-mourinho-na-selecao=f604026 |title=Expresso &#124; Mada\u00edl quer Mourinho na sele\u00e7\u00e3o |website=Aeiou.expresso.pt |date= |accessdate=2016-07-31}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|author= |url=http://desporto.publico.pt/noticia.aspx?id=1456112 |title=Selec\u00e7\u00e3o: Mada\u00edl tenta Mourinho para dois jogos - P\u00daBLICO |website=Desporto.publico.pt |date=2010-09-16 |accessdate=2016-07-31}}</ref> This bid, however, was blocked by Real Madrid President [[Florentino P\u00e9rez]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.record.xl.pt/Futebol/selecoes//interior.aspx?content_id=464111 |title=Sele\u00e7\u00f5es - Jornal Record |website=Record.xl.pt |date= |accessdate=2016-07-31}}</ref>\n\nOn 21 September 2010, [[Paulo Bento]], the former [[Sporting Clube de Portugal]] coach, was appointed as the Portuguese head coach. Paulo Bento's spell with the Sele\u00e7\u00e3o began with a 3\u20131 home win against Denmark, followed by a 3\u20131 away win against Iceland, pushing Portugal into the second spot of the group. On 17 November, Portugal and Spain faced each other in a friendly to commemorate the 100th year of the modern Portuguese Republic and also to promote the joint Portugal-Spain bid to host the 2018 FIFA World Cup. In a shocking upset, Portugal were 4-0 victors over the reigning World and European champions. In the match Ronaldo should score a wonderful opening goal, only rued out as offside with a little kick by Nani in front of the crossing line. Portugal ended up winning all except one of their remaining qualifying games only losing to Denmark. They finished second in their group and had to qualify in a two-game playoff with Bosnia and Herzegovina. They tied the first game 0-0 in [[Zenica]] and won 6-2 in Lisbon, securing a place in Euro 2012.\n\nPortugal didn't start off the tournament well, as they were defeated 1-0 by Germany. Despite this they bounced back to win their next two games, with a 3-2 win over Denmark and a 2-1 win over the Netherlands. These two wins secured passage to the knockout stages. They faced the Czech Republic in the quarter finals, and won after a Cristiano Ronaldo goal in the 79th minute. They faced Spain in the semifinals, where the match went into penalties after a goalless 120 minutes. Spain defeated Portugal 4-2 on penalty kicks.\n\n==2014 FIFA World Cup==\nOn 30 July 2011 at the [[2014 FIFA World Cup qualification (UEFA)|2014 FIFA World Cup preliminary draw]], Portugal were placed in [[2014 FIFA World Cup qualification \u2013 UEFA Group F|Group F]] along with [[Russia national football team|Russia]], [[Israel national football team|Israel]], [[Northern Ireland national football team|Northern Ireland]], [[Azerbaijan national football team|Azerbaijan]] and [[Luxembourg national football team|Luxembourg]].<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.fifa.com/worldcup/preliminarydraw/news/newsid=1483519/index.html |title=The Preliminary Draw results in full |publisher = FIFA |date=30 July 2011 |accessdate=5 January 2012}}</ref> Portugal had a slightly shaky Qualifying campaign, finishing second in the group after three draws and 1\u20130 loss to the eventual group winners Russia. The third qualifying game was a special one for Portugal's captain, Cristiano Ronaldo, as he became the youngest Portugal player ever to win 100 caps for the national team.\n\n{{quote box|width=33%|align=left|quote=\"It would be a lie to say that we are a top team.

They won the first game in [[Lisbon]] 1\u20130 after a Ronaldo goal, then won the second game in [[Solna]] after a Ronaldo hat-trick. These wins secured Portugal's place in the [[2014 FIFA World Cup]].\n\nPortugal were drawn into [[2014 FIFA World Cup Group G|Group G]] with [[German national football team|Germany]], [[Ghana national football team|Ghana]], and the [[United States men's national soccer team|United States]]. They played Germany first at the [[Itaipava Arena Fonte Nova|Arena Fonte Nova]]. Germany took the lead early on with a [[Thomas M\u00fcller]] penalty kick after a foul on [[Mario G\u00f6tze]]. Germany took a 2\u20130 lead after a goal by [[Toni Kroos]]. Pepe was involved in an altercation with Thomas M\u00fcller, where he headbutted M\u00fcller and was shown a straight red card. Germany went on to win the game 4\u20130 after two more goals by Thomas M\u00fcller. This is Portugal's worst loss ever at a World Cup.\n\nIn their next match with the United States, Portugal opened to scoring early, with Nani scoring in the fifth minute. However, the USA equalized after a goal from [[Jermaine Jones]] in the sixty fourth minute. The United States ended up taking the lead in the eighty first minute after a goal by [[Clint Dempsey]]. [[Cristiano Ronaldo]] crossed for [[Silvestre Varela]] who tied the game in the ninety fifth minute, keeping Portugal's qualification hopes alive.\n\nIn their last match in the group stage, in order to progress they needed to beat Ghana by at least 4 goals, and hope that the United States-Germany match didn't end in a draw. Despite Portugal winning the game 2\u20131, and Germany defeating the USA 1\u20130, Portugal were eliminated on goal differential to the USA.\n\n==Fernando Santos era and Euro 2016 win==\n===Euro 2016===\nPortugal was drawn in [[UEFA Euro 2016 qualifying Group I|Group I]] for [[UEFA Euro 2016 qualifying]] with [[Albania national football team|Albania]], [[Armenia national football team|Armenia]], [[Denmark national football team|Denmark]], and [[Serbia national football team|Serbia]]. Portugal started off with a 1\u20130 loss to Albania, which resulted in [[Paulo Bento]] being dismissed, and veteran of all three of the major clubs in [[Primeira Liga]], [[Fernando Santos (Portuguese footballer)|Fernando Santos]], being brought in as his replacement. Under Santos Portugal would win the rest of its games in qualifying, all by a single goal, and top their group.\n\nDuring the [[UEFA Euro 2016|final tournament]] Portugal were drawn in [[UEFA Euro 2016 Group F|Group F]] with [[Iceland national football team|Iceland]], [[Austria national football team|Austria]] and [[Hungary national football team|Hungary]]. Three draws, including a thrilling 3\u20133 match with Hungary in the last group game, gave Portugal a third-placed finish in their group; however, the new expanded form of the tournament meant Portugal qualified for the knockout stages as one of the best third ranked teams.\n\nPortugal played [[Croatia national football team|Croatia]] in the round of 16. The match produced no shots on goal in ninety minutes. In the 116th minute [[Ivan Peri\u0161i\u0107]] hit the post for Croatia, and under a minute later Cristiano Ronaldo started a move passing to [[Renato Sanches]], who ran it down the field. He passed it to Nani, whose scuffed shot landed at the feet of Ronaldo who had the first shot on goal in the game, which was saved, however the rebound was headed in by substitute [[Ricardo Quaresma]]. Portugal held on and moved on to face [[Poland national football team|Poland]] in the quarter-finals.\n\nThe quarter-finals didn't start out well for Portugal, as [[Robert Lewandowski]] scored for Poland in the 2nd minute. Renato Sanches would equalize for Portugal in the 33rd minute. The game went to penalties, where [[Rui Patr\u00edcio]] made a save on [[Jakub B\u0142aszczykowski]], and on the next spot kick, Ricardo Quaresma won the game for Portugal, and sent them to the semi-finals.\n\nThere, Portugal would face [[Wales national football team|Wales]]. Cristiano Ronaldo gave Portugal the lead from a header in the 50th minute. This goal tied Ronaldo with [[Michel Platini]] for all-time leading scorer at the Euro finals, with nine goals. Just 3 minutes after this goal, Nani gave Portugal a 2\u20130 lead with an assist by Ronaldo. They held on to win, and Ronaldo was declared the Man of the Match, making it the sixth time in the tournament (including qualifiers).\n\n{{football squad on pitch|align=left|clear=none\n| GK = [[Rui Patr\u00edcio|'''Patr\u00edcio''']]\n| RB = [[C\u00e9dric Soares|'''C\u00e9dric''']]\n| LCB = [[Jos\u00e9 Fonte|'''Fonte''']]\n| RCB = [[Pepe (footballer, born 1983)|'''Pepe''']]\n| LB = [[Rapha\u00ebl Guerreiro|'''Guerreiro''']]\n| DM = [[William Carvalho|'''William''']]\n| CM = [[Adrien Silva|'''Adrien''']]\n| LM = [[Jo\u00e3o M\u00e1rio (footballer, born January 1993)|'''Jo\u00e3o M\u00e1rio''']]\n| RM = [[Renato Sanches|'''Sanches''']]\n| RCF = '''[[Nani]]'''\n| LCF = [[Cristiano Ronaldo|'''Ronaldo (C)''']]\n| caption = Portugal's starting lineup for the [[UEFA Euro 2016 Final|Euro 2016 Final]]\n}}\nFor the [[UEFA Euro 2016 Final|Final of Euro 2016]], Portugal played the host nation and favorites to win, [[France national football team|France]]. A [[Dimitri Payet]] challenge on Cristiano Ronaldo forced the Portuguese captain to be substituted despite his attempts to return. France came close to winning the game in the last minute of normal time, when [[Andr\u00e9-Pierre Gignac]] struck the post. In extra time, Portugal's [[Rapha\u00ebl Guerreiro]] hit the crossbar from a free kick. [[\u00c9der]], a substitute striker, eventually scored the winning goal in the 109th minute. With this win Portugal won its first ever major international trophy in the nation's history, led by Cristiano Ronaldo as the captain. Portugal's Renato Sanches was awarded the best young player and Cristiano Ronaldo won the Silver Boot for his 3 goals and 3 assists in the finals.\n\n===2017 FIFA Confederations Cup===\nFollowing their [[UEFA Euro 2016|Euro 2016]] victory, Portugal was allowed to participate in the [[2017 FIFA Confederations Cup]]. Portugal were drawn into [[2017 FIFA Confederations Cup Group A|Group A]] with [[Mexico national football team|Mexico]], [[New Zealand national football team|New Zealand]] and hosts [[Russia national football team|Russia]]. In the opening match, Portugal faced Mexico. [[Ricardo Quaresma]] opened the scored in the 34th minute, following an assist from [[Cristiano Ronaldo]]. However, due to defensive errors [[Javier Hern\u00e1ndez]] scored the equaliser in the 42nd minute. In the second half, [[C\u00e9dric Soares]] restored the advantage for Portugal, but minutes later Mexico would tie the game 2\u20132 after a header from H\u00e9ctor Moreno, ending the match in a draw.\n\nIn the next match, Portugal faced hosts Russia. The Portuguese dominated the Russians from the beginning, and the goal came naturally in thr 9th minute, scored by Cristiano Ronaldo. Afterwards, [[Raphael Guerreiro]] injured himself during the game, being unable to play the rest of the competition, and the match ended with the Portuguese winning. In their last group stage match, Portugal faced New Zeland. Portugal took the advantage in the first half, with goals from Cristiano Ronaldo and [[Bernardo Silva]]. The result would be 4\u20130 in the second half after [[Andr\u00e9 Silva (footballer, born 1995)|Andr\u00e9 Silva]] and [[Nani]] also put the ball in the back of the net. Thus, Portugal went to the semi-finals of the competition as the first place team of Group B, with a better goal difference than Mexico.\n\nIn the semi-finals, Portugal faced [[Copa Am\u00e9rica]] winners [[Chile national football team|Chile]]. The game was extremely close with dangerous situations fot both sides and went into extra time after 90 minutes without a goal. The draw persisted for the entire amount of extra time. During this time, [[Gelson Martins]] replaced [[Andr\u00e9 Gomes]], this being the first time a fourth substitution had been made in an official tournament match. Even before the extra time was over, Chile struck the post twice. The Chileans would eventually be victorious on penalties, with keeper [[Claudio Bravo]] savng all three Portuguese shots. Portugal thus missed out on qualification to the final and an unprecedented title.\n\n{{multiple image\n | align     = right\n | direction = horizontal\n | header    =\n | header_align = left/right/center\n | header_background =\n | footer = Pepe celebrates after scoring a late equalizer against [[Mexico national football team|Mexico]] at the [[2017 FIFA Confederations Cup]] in [[Moscow]].\n | footer_align = left/right/center\n | footer_background =\n | width     =\n | image1    = Mex-por-69.jpg\n | width1    = 200\n | caption1  = \n | alt1      = photograph of a man sucking his thumbs\n | image2    = Mex-por-71.jpg\n | width2    = 193\n | caption2  =\n | alt2      = \n}}\nIn the [[2017 FIFA Confederations Cup#Third place play-off|third place]] play-off match, Portugal faced Mexico in a rematch from the group stage.

Pepe managed to restore equality at 91st minute, sending the game into extra time. During extra time, [[Adrien Silva]] took another penalty, this time successfully, but shortly afterwards [[N\u00e9lson Semedo]] left the team reduced to 10 after being sent off. Despite the numerical advantage on the field, [[Ra\u00fal Jim\u00e9nez]] would eventually also see a red card for a foul on [[Eliseu]]. The result would be unchanged at 2\u20131 until the end. Thus, the Portuguese managed to reach the podium of the competition, finishing in third place.\n\n===2018 FIFA World Cup===\nIn the [[2018 FIFA World Cup qualification (UEFA)|2018 FIFA World Cup preliminary draw]], Portugal were placed in [[2018 FIFA World Cup qualification \u2013 UEFA Group B|Group B]] along with [[Switzerland national football team|Switzerland]], Hungary, [[Faroe Islands national football team|Faroe Islands]], [[Andorra national football team|Andorra]] and [[Latvia national football team|Latvia]]. Portugal would only lose one match in qualifying: a 2\u20130 loss in their opener against Switzerland. However, Portugal would get redemption in their last group stage match, defeating Switzerland 2\u20130 to top their group on goal difference and qualify for the 2018 World Cup.\n\nIn the [[2018 FIFA World Cup]], Portugal were drawn into [[2018 FIFA World Cup Group B|Group B]] with Spain, Morocco and Iran. In their opening match on 15 June, Portugal played against Spain. Cristiano Ronaldo scored with an early penalty, winning it after he was fouled by [[Nacho (footballer, born 1990)|Nacho]] inside the box. [[Diego Costa]] then twisted and turned away from two Portugal defenders to score with a low shot to the left corner which brought the two sides level. But just before the break, [[David de Gea]] fumbled a Ronaldo shot from outside the penalty area through his gloves and over the line. Costa scored his second equaliser of the night just after the restart from close range before Nacho scored with a right foot half-volley in off the post from the edge of the penalty box, his first goal for Spain. As the clock ticked down, however, [[Gerard Piqu\u00e9]] brought down Ronaldo just outside the box, with the Portugal star completing the scoring and his hat-trick with a free kick into the top right corner of the net. The match would finish 3\u20133.\n\nIn the second match, Portugal faced Morocco. Early in the match, [[Jo\u00e3o Moutinho]] swung in a cross from the right after a short corner and Cristiano Ronaldo headed the ball powerfully past goalkeeper [[Munir Mohand Mohamedi|Munir Mohamedi]] from six yards out and into the middle of the goal to open the scoring. Ronaldo played [[Gon\u00e7alo Guedes]] into the box but Munir made a one-handed save. Ronaldo shot over the crossbar when Bernardo Silva's mishit presented him with a shooting chance on the edge of the box early in the second half. [[Rui Patr\u00edcio]] then made a save to preserve Portugal's lead when [[Hakim Ziyech]]'s free kick was headed towards goal by [[Youn\u00e8s Belhanda]], the goalkeeper diving to palm the ball away from danger. Ziyech shot another set-piece just over the crossbar from 25 yards. [[Nordin Amrabat]] and [[Medhi Benatia]] fired over with better chances. With their second loss in a row, Morocco became the first team eliminated from the 2018 FIFA World Cup.\n\nPortugal's last group stage match was against Iran. In the 45th minute, Ricardo Quaresma cut in from the right before scoring with a curling shot off the outside of his right foot that looped over [[Alireza Beiranvand]] into the top-left corner. [[Saeid Ezatolahi]]'s foul on Cristiano Ronaldo won Portugal a penalty, which Ronaldo shot low into the right, enabling Beiranvand to get down and make a stop. Iran then managed to get a penalty in stoppage time after the referee used VAR to determine that C\u00e9dric's handball from [[Sardar Azmoun]]'s header had been intentional, which Karim Ansarifard converted high to his right. The game ended in a 1\u22121 draw, with Portugal advancing to te round of 16 as the runners-up of their group, after Spain drew 2\u22122 with Morocco.\n\nPortugal would be eliminated from the tournament after losing to [[Uruguay national football team|Uruguay]] in the round of 16. In the seventh minute, [[Edinson Cavani]] switched play from right to left with a sweeping pass out to [[Luis Su\u00e1rez]], who delivered a cross which the former headed home at the back post from six yards out. In the 55th minute, Rapha\u00ebl Guerreiro delivered a cross from a short corner on the left, which Pepe finished with a downward header. Just seven minutes later, [[Rodrigo Bentancur]] collected the ball around 30 yards out and slipped a pass out to Cavani on the left side of the penalty area, who then scored his second goal of the match with a curling right-foot strike into the right corner of the net to reclaim the lead for Uruguay. Bernardo Silva shot off-target with the goal gaping after [[Fernando Muslera]]'s mistake, with Cavani seeming to pick up an injury in the scramble. The match finished 2\u20131 to Uruguay and Portugal were eliminated from the tournament.\n\n===2018\u201319 UEFA Nations League===\nFollowing the World Cup, Portugal took part in the inaugural [[2018\u201319 UEFA Nations League|UEFA Nations League]], where the ''Sele\u00e7\u00e3o'' were placed in [[2018\u201319 UEFA Nations League A|League A]] and drawn into [[2018\u201319 UEFA Nations League A#Group 3|Group 3]] with Italy and Poland.

The home side opened the scoring after 18 minutes following a corner kick which was scored by [[Krzysztof Pi\u0105tek]], but Portugal grew and managed to turn the match around just before the break with Andr\u00e9 Silva scoring for the away side, followed by an own goal from [[Kamil Glik]], who put the ball on his own net after a pass from [[R\u00faben Neves]] to [[Rafa Silva]]. In the second half of the match, Bernardo Silva scored Portugal's third goal of the match. Poland did not give up, and [[Jakub Blaszczykowski]] managed to reduce to the home team with a shot from outside the box. Despite this, the Portuguese managed to maintain the advantage and secure a victory by the score of 3\u20132, consolidating the leadership of their group.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.uefa.com/uefanationsleague/season=2019/teams/player=250059115/statistics/|title=Bernardo Silva |website=UEFA.com|publisher=Union of European Football Associations|accessdate=26 February 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.uefa.com/uefanationsleague/season=2019/matches/round=2000959/match=2024021/index.html|title=Poland vs Portugal |website=UEFA.com|publisher=Union of European Football Associations|date=11 October 2018|accessdate=26 February 2019}}</ref> \n\n[[File:Gon\u00e7alo Guedes (cropped).jpg|thumb|left|220px|[[Gon\u00e7alo Guedes]], who scored the winning goal against the [[Netherlands national football team|Netherlands]] in the [[2019 UEFA Nations League Final]]]]\nIn Portugal's third match, they once again faced Italy, this time in [[Milan]].

Afonso Henriques]] in [[Guimar\u00e3es]]. Andr\u00e9 Silva scored the opening goal following a corner kick from [[Renato Sanches]]. In the second half, [[Arkadiusz Milik]] scored a [[Penalty kick (association football)|penalty]] to equalize the match, after [[Danilo Pereira (Portuguese footballer)|Danilo Pereira]] fouled him in the penalty area, leading Danilo to receive a red card and miss the next match.   \n  \nIn the semi-finals, on 5 June, Portugal faced Switzerland. Although the Swiss started the game with more scoring opportunities, it was Portugal who opened the scoring with a free-kick from Cristiano Ronaldo. In the 57th minute, Bernardo Silva was fouled in the penalty area and the match official immediately called a penalty for the Portuguese. However, the team responsible for the VAR drew attention to a move that occurred earlier, in which [[N\u00e9lson Semedo]] appeared to have touched [[Steven Zuber]] in the Portuguese area. After a bid review, referee [[Felix Brych]] gave a penalty to Switzerland, leading [[Ricardo Rodr\u00edguez (footballer)|Ricardo Rodr\u00edguez]] to score the equalizer. The prospect of extra time would become more real until the 88th minute, when R\u00faben Neves pitched the ball to Bernardo Silva, who gave the ball to Cristiano Ronaldo to score Portugal's second goal. Two minutes later, Ronaldo scored his third goal of the game, completing a hat-trick and securing the hosts a spot in [[2019 UEFA Nations League Final|the final]]. With this game, Fernando Santos became the coach with the most victories in the history of the Portuguese team.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.soccerladuma.co.za/news/articles/international/categories/international/hat-trick-hero-cristiano-ronaldo-sets-new-world-record/656483|title=Hat-Trick Hero Ronaldo Sets New World Record|publisher=Soccer Laduma|last=Kappel|first=David|date=6 June 2019|accessdate=6 June 2019}}</ref> \n\nFour days later, in the final on 9 June at the [[Est\u00e1dio do Drag\u00e3o]] in Porto, Portugal faced the Netherlands. Portugal outperformed the Dutch early on, with multiple plays of danger. After much pressure, in the 60th minute, [[Gon\u00e7alo Guedes]] scored the only goal of the match with a shot from outside the box. The Dutch tried to score until the last minute, but the result remained unchanged until the end and Portugal won their second major international trophy in three finals. With this game, [[Rui Patr\u00edcio]] became Portugal's most capped goalkeeper ever, surpassing [[V\u00edtor Ba\u00eda]]'s record.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Law |first1=Matt |title=Result: Goncalo Guedes scores winner as Portugal land UEFA Nations League title |url=https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/football/portugal/uefa-nations-league/result/result-guedes-scores-winner-as-portugal-land-nations-league-title_361579.html |accessdate=9 June 2019 |publisher=Sports Mole |date=9 June 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/48191922|title=Nations League final|website=BBC Sport|publisher=British Broadcasting Corporation|language=English|author=Shamoon Hafez|date=9 June 2019|accessdate=10 June 2019}}</ref>\n\n===Euro 2020===\nPortugal was drawn in [[UEFA Euro 2020 qualifying Group B|Group B]] for [[UEFA Euro 2020 qualifying]] with [[Lithuania national football team|Lithuania]], [[Luxembourg national football team|Luxembourg]], [[Ukraine national football team|Ukraine]] and Serbia.

They are best known for their 1995 radio hit \"[[Stars (Hum song)|Stars]]\". After initially disbanding in 2000, Hum were largely inactive (save for sporadic performances) until reuniting in 2015 for a series of short tours and, {{As of|2017|lc=y}}, a forthcoming album of new material.\n\n==History==\n\n===Founding and early recordings===\n{{Unreferenced section|date=January 2011}}\nThe initial line-up of the band formed in 1989, with guitarist Andy Switzky, guitarist Matt Talbott, bass guitarist Akis Boyatzis and drummer Jeff Kropp. Matt and Andy met at a cafe named Treno's, in [[Urbana, Illinois|Urbana]], Illinois, where Andy worked. Discussions about music led to the two forming the nucleus of Hum. Matt had previously played in the local group We Ate Plato and was presently a member of Honcho Overload; Andy had performed in the semi-serious live band Obvious Man and had studio experience with Designer Mustard Gas.\n\nThe group performed at Akis' basement for their initial months. Due to a suggestion from Rick Valentin of [[Poster Children]], the band chose the name Hum (over contenders like [[Grendel]]'s Arm, Pod, and Feedbag), an intentional vague description of their sound and went through a second drummer before overhearing Bryan St. Pere playing along to a [[Rush (band)|Rush]] record out of his apartment window and recruiting him.\n\nThis line-up was not to last long, though, as Akis left home for [[Greece]] in 1990. Local musician Joe Futrelle, who played with Andy in Designer Mustard Gas joined briefly, before leaving for more serious musical pursuits and was replaced by Rod van Huis, later of Steakdaddy Six. Due to personal reasons, he amicably split the band and went on to perform in the Great Crusades. With the addition of Balthazar \"Baltie\" de Lay, of the band Mother (later Menthol), the band recorded their first demo in famous engineer [[Steve Albini]]'s basement in [[Chicago]].\n\nThe band recorded eight songs in first or second takes, with only vocal overdubs and had an official demo to shop around, named ''Kissing Me Is Like Kissing an Angel''. At this point, the group's primary singer, guitarist and songwriter was Andy and that remained the case when their first album, ''Fillet Show'', was released by local label 12 Inch Records in 1991. The album features a faster, heavy sound somewhere between [[punk rock]] and [[Heavy metal (music)|heavy metal]], with more overt political and humorous material than the later oblique lyrics that Matt Talbott would write.\n\nPressure grew on Baltie to focus his efforts on Mother and other pursuits, so he too left on good terms with the other members of Hum. Left without a bassist again, Matt suggested Jeff Dimpsey, his bandmate in Honcho Overload. In that group, and during his brief stint with the Poster Children, Jeff played guitar and Matt actually played bass, but the transition was smooth, and the band recorded two singles, \"Hello Kitty\" and \"Sundress\", the former on 12 Inch, and the latter on the new Champaign-based label Mud Records. Around this time, the Champaign scene started to coalesce with members of one band joining up with members of another to form an indefinite amount of one-off side projects, and the [[Parasol Records]] distribution company helped promote local acts nationally and brought in alternative music to record stores in Champaign, Illinois.\n\nIn the interim between these singles and the next album, creative differences grew between members of the band, and Andy left. The remaining members recruited a local fan named Tim Lash, almost a decade their junior, to play guitar. His previous experience had been in a [[speed metal]] group The Grand Vizars (with Joe Ludwinski from Scurvine and Matt Friedburger from [[The Fiery Furnaces]]), and once casually remarked to the band after a show that if they ever needed a guitarist, they could give him a call.\n\n===Mainstream success===\n\n{{Unreferenced section|date=January 2011}}\n\nThe classic lineup of the band was in place, and the quartet headed to Idful Studios with [[Brad Wood]] producing ''[[Electra 2000]]''. The album was released in its first two pressings by 12 Inch Records and distributed through Cargo Records. The lyrics were far more non-linear and conceptual, and introduced some of the space and science imagery that would dominate later songs. The album produced no singles, but due in no small part to distribution by Parasol, caught the attention of representative of [[RCA Records]]. The band was signed, and hooked up with local club owner and sometimes-musician Ward Gollings as tour manager. They switched to producer Keith Cleversley for their major-label debut ''[[You'd Prefer an Astronaut]]'' in 1995. The album would produce their biggest hit, the single \"[[Stars (Hum song)|Stars]]\", with promotional appearances on [[Space Ghost Coast to Coast]], and [[The Howard Stern Show]].\n\nThe album swiftly sold 250,000 copies, and Hum played their largest dates promoting the record. Further singles \"The Pod\" and the promotional \"I'd Like Your Hair Long\" failed to generate much interest, and the band spent much of the rest of the year and 1996 on the road. In late 1997, they teamed with Mark Rubel at Pogo Studios to record their fourth album, ''[[Downward Is Heavenward]]''.\n\nThe biggest promotion for the album came with an appearance on Modern Rock Live on January 25, 1998, and the album was released in February. Singles \"Green to Me\" and \"Comin' Home\" were promotional-only, and the band only sold 30,000 copies by the end of the year. Around this time, the band missed out on an opportunity to record live favorite [[the Police]]'s \"Invisible Sun\" for the [[The X-Files (film)|X-Files: Fight the Future]] film soundtrack. At the last minute, [[Sting (musician)|Sting]] and [[Aswad (band)|Aswad]] decided to record a [[reggae]] cover, keeping the band from a large potential fan base. Due to disappointing sales, and large record label mergers, the band was dropped from their contract in 2000. While touring in [[Canada]], the band's van got into a minor accident, signaling the last straw. They played their final shows in 2000 on December 29 in [[St. Louis]], [[Missouri]] and December 31 in Chicago.\n\n===Post-Hum projects===\n{{Unreferenced section|date=January 2011}}\n\nMatt went on to form [[Centaur (band)|Centaur]] with local musicians [[Derek Niedringhaus]] and [[Jim Kelly (musician)|Jim Kelly]]. The former had been in [[Castor (band)|Castor]] and [[Sarge (band)|Sarge]], who had been produced by Matt, and the latter was involved with Parasol and drummed in [[16 Tons (band)|16 Tons]] and [[Love Cup]]. To date, only one album has been released, ''[[In Streams]]'', on the [[Martians Go Home (record label)|Martians Go Home]] label, set up by the band themselves to release the vinyl version of ''\"Downward Is Heavenward\"'' and the re-release of ''Electra 2000'' on [[compact disc|CD]]. A second is being produced. Matt produces in his studio [[Great Western Recorders]], now [http://www.earthanalogrecords.com/ Earth Analog Records] and has started a family. He also teaches at [[Millikin University]] in [[Decatur, Illinois]]. Matt is also currently contributing to Open Hand, on [[Trustkill Records]], and contributed vocals to First Days of Spring from the [[Neverending White Lights]] album [[Act 1: Goodbye Friends of the Heavenly Bodies]] released in 2005.\n\nJeff resurrected a side-project from 1997, [[National Skyline]] with [[Jeff Garber]], also of Castor. This outfit put out a [[National Skyline (album)|self-titled album]], the ep ''[[Exit Now]]'', and a second full-length, ''[[This = Everything]]''. The band was also featured on the Parasol compilation ''[[Sweet Sixteen, Volume 2]]''. He moved to [[Texas]] to pursue his career. Jeff is currently playing with Adam Fein ([[Absinthe Blind]]) in a new band called Gazelle.\n\nTim has played in other groups after Hum, the electronic duo [[Glifted]] with [[T. J. Harrison]] of Love Cup, and [[Balisong (band)|Balisong]], a heavy rock trio with local musicians Eric Steckler and Joe Ludwinski. To date, Glifted have released ''[[Under and In]]'' on Martians Go Home. A follow-up album was reported to be in production by Lash, but in 2008 he confirmed that Glifted was no more. Balisong never recorded anything, but played a few live shows in Champaign. Tim is currently working with Joe Ludwinski (Scurvine, The Grand Vizars), and Jason Milam (Scurvine, Lovecup) on a new project called Alpha Mile. Alpha Mile played their first show in December 2008 at the Highdive in Champaign. Alpha Mile has been recording off and on, and hope to have an album out in 2010. The [[Pygmalion Music Festival|2009 Pygmalion Music Festival]] featured sets from both Gazelle and Alpha Mile. This was Gazelle's debut live show.\n\nBryan has largely quit music with a brief stint on Vykanthrope's The Devil's Waiting EP 2013 thundering through Viking War Doom and is rumored to have taken up residence in [[Indiana]] in the [[Pharmaceutical drug|pharmaceutical]] industry. He also has a family today.\n\n===Reunions===\nIn 2003, the band reunited for a one-off appearance at Furnace Fest near downtown [[Birmingham, Alabama|Birmingham]], [[Alabama]] at the historic [[Sloss Furnaces]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.songkick.com/festivals/57886-furnace-fest/id/4315086-furnace-fest-2003|title=Furnace Fest 2003|publisher=songkick|accessdate=8 June 2015}}</ref> Furnace Fest, held August 15\u201317, 2003, was a festival of [[hard rock]], [[Alternative rock|alternative]], [[indie rock|indie]], and [[emo]] acts from across the country. As the story went, the band said that they would be willing to play any show for a high price (assuming that no one would actually be willing to pay that amount), and the organizers at Furnacefest called their bluff.{{citation needed|date=June 2015}} Hum headlined Saturday night, playing a set and an encore. The band was reportedly dissatisfied with the performance, and actually preferred the surprise warm-up show they played in Champaign directly prior.{{citation needed|date=June 2015}}\n\nThough declining to reform on a permanent basis, Hum has continued to perform occasional club shows and regional festival appearances. In an interview with [[The A.V. Club]], for whom Hum headlined a show in 2011, Matt Talbot affirmed that Hum was likely to continue on an informal, sporadic basis.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.avclub.com/articles/hums-matt-talbott,61299/|title=Hum\u2019s Matt Talbott|publisher=The A.V.

Due to a suggestion from Rick Valentin of [[Poster Children]], the band chose the name Hum (over contenders like [[Grendel]]'s Arm, Pod, and Feedbag), an intentional vague description of their sound and went through a second drummer before overhearing Bryan St. Pere playing along to a [[Rush (band)|Rush]] record out of his apartment window and recruiting him.\n\nThis line-up was not to last long, though, as Akis left home for [[Greece]] in 1990. Local musician Joe Futrelle, who played with Andy in Designer Mustard Gas joined briefly, before leaving for more serious musical pursuits and was replaced by Rod van Huis, later of Steakdaddy Six. Due to personal reasons, he amicably split the band and went on to perform in the Great Crusades. With the addition of Balthazar \"Baltie\" de Lay, of the band Mother (later Menthol), the band recorded their first demo in famous engineer [[Steve Albini]]'s basement in [[Chicago]].\n\nThe band recorded eight songs in first or second takes, with only vocal overdubs and had an official demo to shop around, named ''Kissing Me Is Like Kissing an Angel''. At this point, the group's primary singer, guitarist and songwriter was Andy and that remained the case when their first album, ''Fillet Show'', was released by local label 12 Inch Records in 1991. The album features a faster, heavy sound somewhere between [[punk rock]] and [[Heavy metal (music)|heavy metal]], with more overt political and humorous material than the later oblique lyrics that Matt Talbott would write.\n\nPressure grew on Baltie to focus his efforts on Mother and other pursuits, so he too left on good terms with the other members of Hum. Left without a bassist again, Matt suggested Jeff Dimpsey, his bandmate in Honcho Overload. In that group, and during his brief stint with the Poster Children, Jeff played guitar and Matt actually played bass, but the transition was smooth, and the band recorded two singles, \"Hello Kitty\" and \"Sundress\", the former on 12 Inch, and the latter on the new Champaign-based label Mud Records. Around this time, the Champaign scene started to coalesce with members of one band joining up with members of another to form an indefinite amount of one-off side projects, and the [[Parasol Records]] distribution company helped promote local acts nationally and brought in alternative music to record stores in Champaign, Illinois.\n\nIn the interim between these singles and the next album, creative differences grew between members of the band, and Andy left. The remaining members recruited a local fan named Tim Lash, almost a decade their junior, to play guitar. His previous experience had been in a [[speed metal]] group The Grand Vizars (with Joe Ludwinski from Scurvine and Matt Friedburger from [[The Fiery Furnaces]]), and once casually remarked to the band after a show that if they ever needed a guitarist, they could give him a call.\n\n===Mainstream success===\n\n{{Unreferenced section|date=January 2011}}\n\nThe classic lineup of the band was in place, and the quartet headed to Idful Studios with [[Brad Wood]] producing ''[[Electra 2000]]''. The album was released in its first two pressings by 12 Inch Records and distributed through Cargo Records. The lyrics were far more non-linear and conceptual, and introduced some of the space and science imagery that would dominate later songs. The album produced no singles, but due in no small part to distribution by Parasol, caught the attention of representative of [[RCA Records]]. The band was signed, and hooked up with local club owner and sometimes-musician Ward Gollings as tour manager. They switched to producer Keith Cleversley for their major-label debut ''[[You'd Prefer an Astronaut]]'' in 1995. The album would produce their biggest hit, the single \"[[Stars (Hum song)|Stars]]\", with promotional appearances on [[Space Ghost Coast to Coast]], and [[The Howard Stern Show]].\n\nThe album swiftly sold 250,000 copies, and Hum played their largest dates promoting the record. Further singles \"The Pod\" and the promotional \"I'd Like Your Hair Long\" failed to generate much interest, and the band spent much of the rest of the year and 1996 on the road. In late 1997, they teamed with Mark Rubel at Pogo Studios to record their fourth album, ''[[Downward Is Heavenward]]''.\n\nThe biggest promotion for the album came with an appearance on Modern Rock Live on January 25, 1998, and the album was released in February. Singles \"Green to Me\" and \"Comin' Home\" were promotional-only, and the band only sold 30,000 copies by the end of the year. Around this time, the band missed out on an opportunity to record live favorite [[the Police]]'s \"Invisible Sun\" for the [[The X-Files (film)|X-Files: Fight the Future]] film soundtrack. At the last minute, [[Sting (musician)|Sting]] and [[Aswad (band)|Aswad]] decided to record a [[reggae]] cover, keeping the band from a large potential fan base. Due to disappointing sales, and large record label mergers, the band was dropped from their contract in 2000. While touring in [[Canada]], the band's van got into a minor accident, signaling the last straw. They played their final shows in 2000 on December 29 in [[St. Louis]], [[Missouri]] and December 31 in Chicago.\n\n===Post-Hum projects===\n{{Unreferenced section|date=January 2011}}\n\nMatt went on to form [[Centaur (band)|Centaur]] with local musicians [[Derek Niedringhaus]] and [[Jim Kelly (musician)|Jim Kelly]]. The former had been in [[Castor (band)|Castor]] and [[Sarge (band)|Sarge]], who had been produced by Matt, and the latter was involved with Parasol and drummed in [[16 Tons (band)|16 Tons]] and [[Love Cup]]. To date, only one album has been released, ''[[In Streams]]'', on the [[Martians Go Home (record label)|Martians Go Home]] label, set up by the band themselves to release the vinyl version of ''\"Downward Is Heavenward\"'' and the re-release of ''Electra 2000'' on [[compact disc|CD]]. A second is being produced. Matt produces in his studio [[Great Western Recorders]], now [http://www.earthanalogrecords.com/ Earth Analog Records] and has started a family. He also teaches at [[Millikin University]] in [[Decatur, Illinois]]. Matt is also currently contributing to Open Hand, on [[Trustkill Records]], and contributed vocals to First Days of Spring from the [[Neverending White Lights]] album [[Act 1: Goodbye Friends of the Heavenly Bodies]] released in 2005.\n\nJeff resurrected a side-project from 1997, [[National Skyline]] with [[Jeff Garber]], also of Castor. This outfit put out a [[National Skyline (album)|self-titled album]], the ep ''[[Exit Now]]'', and a second full-length, ''[[This = Everything]]''. The band was also featured on the Parasol compilation ''[[Sweet Sixteen, Volume 2]]''. He moved to [[Texas]] to pursue his career. Jeff is currently playing with Adam Fein ([[Absinthe Blind]]) in a new band called Gazelle.\n\nTim has played in other groups after Hum, the electronic duo [[Glifted]] with [[T. J. Harrison]] of Love Cup, and [[Balisong (band)|Balisong]], a heavy rock trio with local musicians Eric Steckler and Joe Ludwinski. To date, Glifted have released ''[[Under and In]]'' on Martians Go Home. A follow-up album was reported to be in production by Lash, but in 2008 he confirmed that Glifted was no more. Balisong never recorded anything, but played a few live shows in Champaign. Tim is currently working with Joe Ludwinski (Scurvine, The Grand Vizars), and Jason Milam (Scurvine, Lovecup) on a new project called Alpha Mile. Alpha Mile played their first show in December 2008 at the Highdive in Champaign. Alpha Mile has been recording off and on, and hope to have an album out in 2010. The [[Pygmalion Music Festival|2009 Pygmalion Music Festival]] featured sets from both Gazelle and Alpha Mile. This was Gazelle's debut live show.\n\nBryan has largely quit music with a brief stint on Vykanthrope's The Devil's Waiting EP 2013 thundering through Viking War Doom and is rumored to have taken up residence in [[Indiana]] in the [[Pharmaceutical drug|pharmaceutical]] industry. He also has a family today.\n\n===Reunions===\nIn 2003, the band reunited for a one-off appearance at Furnace Fest near downtown [[Birmingham, Alabama|Birmingham]], [[Alabama]] at the historic [[Sloss Furnaces]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.songkick.com/festivals/57886-furnace-fest/id/4315086-furnace-fest-2003|title=Furnace Fest 2003|publisher=songkick|accessdate=8 June 2015}}</ref> Furnace Fest, held August 15\u201317, 2003, was a festival of [[hard rock]], [[Alternative rock|alternative]], [[indie rock|indie]], and [[emo]] acts from across the country.
