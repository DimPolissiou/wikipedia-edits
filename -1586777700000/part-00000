It was also directed by Jones. The film tells the story of Brian Cohen (played by Chapman), a young [[Jewish]] man who is born on the same day as\u2014and next door to\u2014[[Jesus|Jesus Christ]], and is subsequently mistaken for the [[Messiah]].\n\nFollowing the withdrawal of funding by [[EMI Films]] just days before production was scheduled to begin, long-time Monty Python fan and former member of [[the Beatles]], [[George Harrison]], arranged financing for ''Life of Brian'' through the formation of his company [[HandMade Films]].<ref name=\"rolling stone\">{{cite web|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/lists/10-things-you-didnt-know-george-harrison-did-w452593|title=10 Things You Didn't Know George Harrison Did|author=Jordan Runtagh|date=26 November 2016|accessdate=25 February 2017|work=Rolling Stone}}</ref>\n\nThe film contains themes of religious satire that were controversial at the time of its release, drawing accusations of [[blasphemy]], and protests from some religious groups.

Brian later grows up an idealistic young man who resents the continuing [[Iudaea province|Roman occupation of Judea]]. While attending Jesus's [[Sermon on the Mount]], Brian becomes infatuated with an attractive young rebel, Judith. His desire for her and hatred for the Romans lead him to join the \"People's Front of Judea\", one of many fractious and bickering [[Zealots|independence movements]] who spend more time fighting each other than the Romans.\n\nAfter several misadventures, and escaping from [[Pontius Pilate]], Brian winds up in a line-up of would-be mystics and prophets who harangue the passing crowd in a plaza. Forced to come up with something plausible in order to blend in and keep the guards off his back, Brian repeats some of what he had heard Jesus say, and quickly attracts a small but intrigued audience. Once the guards have left, Brian tries to put the episode behind him, but he has unintentionally inspired a movement. He grows frantic when he finds that some people have started to follow him around, with even the slightest unusual occurrence being hailed as a [[miracle]]. Their responses grow in fervour and intensity, making it harder and harder for him to get away from them, yet because of the mob's excitement over the \"miracles\" they discover, they ultimately end up completely ignoring Brian himself.  Judith is the only one who does not leave; Brian and Judith then spend the night together. In the morning, Brian, completely naked, opens the curtains to discover an enormous crowd, which proclaims him to be the [[Messiah]], outside his mother's house. Brian's mother protests, telling the crowd that \"He's not the Messiah; he's a very naughty boy,\" and, \"There's no Messiah in here. There's a ''mess'', all right, but no Messiah.\" All of her attempts at dispersing the crowd are rebuffed. Furthermore, once Brian addresses them, he also finds that he is unable to change their minds. His followers are completely committed to their belief in Brian's divinity. They immediately seize upon everything he says and does as points of doctrine.\n\nThe hapless Brian is unable to escape his unwanted \"disciples\"; even his mother's house is surrounded by an enormous, enraptured crowd. They fling their afflicted bodies at him, demanding [[Faith healing|miracle cures]] and divine secrets. After sneaking out the back, Brian is then finally captured and scheduled to be [[Crucifixion|crucified]]. Meanwhile, yet another huge crowd has assembled outside the palace. Pontius Pilate (together with the visiting Biggus Dickus) tries to quell the feeling of revolution by granting them the choice of one person to be pardoned. The crowd, however, shouts out names containing the letter \"r\", mocking Pilate's [[rhotacism (speech impediment)|rhotacistic]] speech impediment. Eventually, Judith appears in the crowd and calls for the release of Brian, which the crowd echoes, since the name also contains an \"r\". Pilate agrees to \"welease Bwian\".<ref name=\"Welease\"/>\n\nHis order is eventually relayed to the guards, but in a scene that parodies the climax of the film ''[[Spartacus (film)|Spartacus]]'', various crucified people all claim to be \"Brian of Nazareth\" so they can be free and the wrong man is accidentally released. Various other opportunities for a reprieve for Brian are denied as, one by one, his \"allies\" (including Judith) step forward to explain why they are leaving the \"noble freedom fighter\" hanging in the hot sun, while his mother expresses regret for having raised him at all. Hope is renewed when a crack suicide squad from the \"Judean People's Front\" (not to be confused with the People's Front of Judea) come charging towards the Romans, but rather than fighting to release Brian or the other prisoners, they commit mass suicide as a form of political protest. Condemned to a slow and painful death, Brian finds his spirits lifted by his fellow sufferers, who cheerfully start singing \"[[Always Look on the Bright Side of Life]].\"<ref>{{cite book |first1=Alan |last1=Parker |first2=Mick |last2=O'Shea |date=2006 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=G49bRxbeH1kC&pg=PA106 |title=And Now For Something Completely Digital: The Complete Illustrated Guide to Monty Python CDs and DVDs |publisher=The Disinformation Company|isbn=9781932857313 }}</ref>\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Graham Chapman]] as Brian Cohen (of Nazareth), Biggus Dickus, 2nd wise man\n* [[John Cleese]] as Reg, [[High Priest of Israel|High priest]], Centurion of the Yard, Deadly Dirk, Arthur, 1st wise man\n* [[Terry Gilliam]] as Another person further forward (at Mount \u2013 \"Do you hear that?

By coincidence Milligan was visiting his old [[Tunisia campaign|World War II]] battlefields in [[Tunisia]] where the film was being made.

Shortly after the release of ''[[Monty Python and the Holy Grail]]'' (1975), Eric Idle flippantly suggested that the title of the Pythons' forthcoming feature would be ''Jesus Christ \u2013 Lust for Glory'' (a play on the UK title for the 1970 American film ''[[Patton (film)|Patton]]'').<ref name=\"From Fringe to Flying Circus\">{{cite book |author=Wilmut, Roger |date=1980 |title=From Fringe to Flying Circus |location= London |publisher=Eyre Methuen Ltd |isbn=0-413-46950-6 |pages=247\u2013250}}</ref> This was after he had become frustrated at repeatedly being asked what it would be called, despite the troupe not having given the matter of a third film any consideration. However, they shared a distrust of organised religion, and, after witnessing the critically acclaimed ''Holy Grail''{{'}}s enormous financial turnover, confirming an appetite among the fans for more cinematic endeavours, they began to seriously consider a film lampooning the [[Christianity in the 1st century|New Testament era]] in the same way that ''Holy Grail'' had lampooned [[Arthurian legend]]. All they needed was an idea for a plot. Eric Idle and Terry Gilliam, while promoting ''Holy Grail'' in [[Amsterdam]], had come up with a sketch in which Jesus' cross is falling apart because of the idiotic carpenters who built it and he angrily tells them how to do it correctly. However, after an early [[brainstorming]] stage, and despite being non-believers, they agreed that Jesus was \"definitely a good guy\" and found nothing to mock in his actual teachings: \"He's not particularly funny, what he's saying isn't mockable, it's very decent stuff\", said Idle later.<ref name=\"autobiography\">{{cite book |author=Chapman, Graham |display-authors=4 |author2=Cleese, John |author3=Gilliam, Terry |author4=Idle, Eric |author5=Jones, Terry |author6=Palin, Michael |author7=with McCabe, Bob |date=2003 |title=The Pythons Autobiography by The Pythons |location= London |publisher=Orion Publishing Group |isbn=0-7528-5293-0 |pages=349\u2013387}}</ref> After settling on the name Brian for their new protagonist, one idea considered was that of \"the 13th disciple\".<ref name=\"From Fringe to Flying Circus\" /> The focus eventually shifted to a separate individual born at a similar time and location who would be mistaken for the Messiah, but had no desire to be followed as such.<ref name=\"Bevan\">Nathan Bevan (5 March 2011).

Gilliam again contributed two animated sequences (one being the opening credits) and took charge of [[set design]]. However, this did not put an absolute end to their feuding. On the DVD commentary, Gilliam expresses pride in one set in particular, the main hall of [[Antonia Fortress|Pilate's fortress]], which had been designed so that it looked like an ancient synagogue that the Romans had converted by dumping [[Roman architecture|their structural artefacts]] (such as marble floors and columns) on top. He reveals his consternation at Jones for not paying enough attention to it in the [[cinematography]]. Gilliam also worked on the [[Matte (filmmaking)|matte]] paintings, useful in particular for the very first shot of the three wise men against a star-scape and in giving the illusion of the whole of the outside of the fortress being covered in graffiti. Perhaps the most significant contribution from Gilliam was the scene in which Brian accidentally leaps off a high building and lands inside a starship about to engage in an interstellar war. This was done \"in camera\" using a hand-built model starship and miniature pyrotechnics, likely influenced by the recently released ''[[Star Wars (film)|Star Wars]]''.

Over the next few months ''Life of Brian'' was re-edited and re-screened a number of times for different preview audiences, losing a number of entire filmed sequences.<ref name=\"From Fringe to Flying Circus\" />\n\n===Editing===\nA number of scenes were cut during the editing process. Five [[deleted scene]]s, a total of 13 minutes, including the controversial \"Otto\", were first made available in 1997 on the [[Criterion Collection]] [[Laserdisc]].<ref>{{cite web|author=Laserdisc Database|title=Criterion Life of Brian|url=http://www.lddb.com/laserdisc/08009/CC1504L/Monty-Python:-Life-of-Brian:-Special-Edition-(1979)|accessdate=13 December 2011}}</ref> An unknown amount of raw footage was destroyed in 1998 by the company that bought Handmade Films. However, a number of them (of varying quality) were shown the following year on the [[Paramount Comedy Channel]] in the UK. The scenes shown included three shepherds discussing sheep and completely missing the arrival of the angel heralding Jesus's birth, which would have been at the very start of the film; a segment showing the attempted kidnap of Pilate's wife (a large woman played by John Case<!--Please don't change \"Case\" to \"Cleese\"; it's not a typo-->) whose escape results in a fistfight; a scene introducing hardline [[Zionist]] Otto, leader of the Judean People's Front (played by Eric Idle) and his men who practise a suicide run in the courtyard; and a brief scene in which Judith releases some birds into the air in an attempt to summon help.

The logo of the Judean People's Front, designed by Terry Gilliam,<ref name=\"immaculate\">{{cite video |date=2007 |title=The Story of Brian |medium=Monty Python's Life of Brian: The Immaculate Edition DVD |publisher= [[Sony Pictures Home Entertainment]]}}</ref> was a [[Star of David]] with a small line added to each point so it resembled a [[swastika]], most familiar in the West as the symbol of the anti-Semitic Nazi movement. The rest of this faction also all had the same thin moustaches, and wore a spike on their helmets, similar to those on [[Pickelhaube|Imperial German helmets]]. The official reason for the cutting was that Otto's dialogue slowed down the narrative. However, Gilliam, writing in ''The Pythons Autobiography by The Pythons'', said he thought it should have stayed, saying \"Listen, we've alienated the Christians, let's get the Jews now.\" Idle himself was said to have been uncomfortable with the character; \"It's essentially a pretty savage attack on rabid Zionism, suggesting it's rather akin to Nazism, which is a bit strong to take, but certainly a point of view.\"<ref name=\"autobiography\" /> [[Michael Palin]]'s personal journal entries from the period when various edits of ''Brian'' were being test-screened consistently reference the Pythons' and filmmakers' concerns that the Otto scenes were slowing the story down and thus were top of the list to be chopped from the final cut of the film.<ref name=\"autogenerated1969\" /> However, [[Oxford Brookes University]] historian David Nash says the removal of the scene represented \"a form of self-censorship\" and the Otto sequence \"which involved a character representative of extreme forms of [[Zionism]]\" was cut \"in the interests of smoothing the way for the film's distribution in America.\"<ref>{{cite book |last=Nash |first=David |title=Blasphemy in the Christian World: A History |publisher=Oxford University Press |date=2007 |page=214 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OIA_i8jviucC&lpg=PA214&dq=%22in%20the%20interests%22%20%22Blasphemy%20in%20the%20Christian%20world%22%20%22David%20Nash%22&pg=PA214#v=onepage&q=zionism&f=false |accessdate=18 May 2010 |isbn=978-0-19-925516-0}}</ref>\n\nThe only scene with Otto that remains in the film is during the [[crucifixion]] sequence. Otto arrives with his \"crack suicide squad\", sending the Roman soldiers fleeing in terror. Instead of doing anything useful, they \"attack\" by committing mass suicide in front of the cross (\"Zat showed 'em, huh?\" says the dying Otto, to which Brian despondently replies \"You silly sods!\"), ending Brian's hope of rescue (they do however show some signs of life during the famous rendition of \"[[Always Look on the Bright Side of Life]]\" when they are seen waving their toes in unison in time to the music). Terry Jones once mentioned that the only reason this excerpt was not cut too was due to [[continuity (fiction)|continuity]] reasons, as their dead bodies were very prominently placed throughout the rest of the scene. He acknowledged that some of the humour of this sole remaining contribution was lost through the earlier edits, but felt they were necessary to the overall pacing.\n\nOtto's scenes, and those with Pilate's wife, were cut from the film after the script had gone to the publishers, and so they can be found in the published version of the script. Also present is a scene where, after Brian has led the [[Legio V Macedonica|Fifth Legion]] to the headquarters of the People's Front of Judea, Reg ([[John Cleese]]) says \"You cunt!! You stupid, bird-brained, flat-headed...\"<ref>{{cite book |author=Chapman, Graham |display-authors=etal |date=1979 |title=Monty Python's The Life of Brian/MONTYPYTHONSCRAPBOOK |pages=script p.34 |nopp=true|title-link=Monty Python's The Life of Brian/MONTYPYTHONSCRAPBOOK }}</ref> The profanity was overdubbed to \"you klutz\" before the film was released. Cleese approved of this editing as he felt the reaction to the [[four-letter word]] would \"get in the way of the comedy.\"<ref name=\"autobiography\" />\n\nAn early listing of the sequence of sketches reprinted in ''Monty Python: The Case Against'' by Robert Hewison reveals that the film was to have begun with a set of sketches at an English public school. Much of this material was first printed in the ''[[Monty Python's The Life of Brian / Monty Python Scrapbook]]'' that accompanied the original script publication of ''The Life of Brian'' and then subsequently reused. The song \"[[All Things Dull and Ugly]]\" and the parody scripture reading \"Martyrdom of St. Victor\" were performed on ''[[Monty Python's Contractual Obligation Album]]'' (1980). The idea of a violent rugby match between school masters and small boys was filmed in ''[[Monty Python's The Meaning of Life]]'' (1983). A sketch about a boy who dies at school appeared on the unreleased ''[[The Hastily Cobbled Together for a Fast Buck Album]]'' (1981).\n\n==Soundtrack==\n{{main|Monty Python's Life of Brian (album)}}\nAn album was also released by Monty Python in 1979 in conjunction with the film. In addition to the \"[[Brian Song]]\"  and \"[[Always Look on the Bright Side of Life]]\", it contains scenes from the film with brief linking sections performed by Eric Idle and Graham Chapman. The album opens with a brief rendition of \"[[Hava Nagila]]\" on Scottish bagpipes. A CD version was released in 1997.\n\nAn album of the songs sung in ''[[Monty Python's Life of Brian (album)|Monty Python's Life of Brian]]'' was released on the Disky label. \"Always Look on the Bright Side of Life\" was later re-released with great success, after being sung by British [[Association football|football]] fans. Its popularity became truly evident in 1982 during the [[Falklands War]] when sailors aboard the destroyer [[HMS Sheffield (D80)|HMS ''Sheffield'']], severely damaged in an Argentinean [[Exocet]] missile attack on 4 May, started singing it while awaiting rescue.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.icons.org.uk/nom/nominations/always-look-on-the-bright-side-of-life|title=Icons of England, \"Always Look on the Bright Side of Life\"|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110717050535/http://www.icons.org.uk/nom/nominations/always-look-on-the-bright-side-of-life|archivedate=17 July 2011|df=dmy-all}}</ref><ref>\n{{cite news|url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/comment/columnists/ben_macintyre/article2835095.ece|title=Always look on the bright side of strife: The sardonic humour of war|work=The Times |location=UK |date=9 November 2007 | accessdate=5 April 2010 | first=Ben | last=MacIntyre}}</ref> Many people have come to see the song as a life-affirming ode to [[optimism]].

It consisted mostly of stock travelogue footage and featured arch comments from Cleese. For instance, a shot of Bulgarian girls in ceremonial dresses was accompanied by the comment \"Hard to believe, isn't it, that these simple happy folk are dedicated to the destruction of Western Civilisation as we know it!\", [[Communist Bulgaria]] being a member of the [[Warsaw Pact]] at the time. Not only was this a spoof of travelogues ''per se'', it was a protest against the then common practice in Britain of showing cheaply made banal short features before a main feature.\n\n''Life of Brian'' opened on 17 August 1979 in five North American theatres and grossed US$140,034 ($28,007 per screen) in its opening weekend. Its total gross was $19,398,164. It was the highest grossing British film in North America that year.

It grossed $26,376 ($5,275 per screen) in its opening weekend. It ran until October 2004, playing at 28 screens at its widest point, eventually grossing $646,124 during its re-release. By comparison, a re-release of ''[[Monty Python and the Holy Grail]]'' had earned $1.8 million three years earlier. A DVD of the film was also released that year.\n\n==Reception==\nReviews from critics were mostly positive on the film's release.

Yet the film was surrounded from its inception by intense anxiety, in some quarters of the Establishment, about the offence it might cause. As a result it gained a certificate for general release only after some cuts had been made. Perhaps more importantly still, the film was shunned by the BBC and ITV, who declined to show it for fear of offending Christians in the UK.

Many Christian protesters said that it was mocking Jesus' suffering by turning it into a \"Jolly Boys Outing\" (such as when Mr Cheeky turns to Brian and says: \"See, not so bad once you're up!\"), capped by Brian's fellow sufferers suddenly bursting into song. This is reinforced by the fact that several characters throughout the film claim crucifixion is not as bad as it seems. For example, when Brian asks his cellmate in prison what will happen to him, he replies: \"Oh, you'll probably get away with crucifixion\". In another example, an old man who works with the People's Front of Judea dismisses crucifixion as \"a doddle\" and says being stabbed would be worse.\n\nThe director, Terry Jones, issued the following riposte to this criticism: \"Any religion that makes a form of torture into an icon that they worship seems to me a pretty sick sort of religion quite honestly.\"<ref name=\"Channel 4\" /> The Pythons also pointed out that crucifixion was a standard form of execution in ancient times and not just one especially reserved for Jesus.<ref>{{cite book |title=Ancient Jewish and Christian Perceptions of Crucifixion |first=David W. |last=Chapman |page=44 |publisher=Mohr Siebeck |date=2008 |isbn=978-3-16-149579-3}}</ref>\n\n===Responses from the cast===\nShortly after the film was released, Cleese and Palin engaged in a [[Friday Night, Saturday Morning#Monty Python's Life of Brian|debate]] on the [[BBC Two|BBC2]] discussion programme ''[[Friday Night, Saturday Morning]]'' with [[Malcolm Muggeridge]] and [[Mervyn Stockwood]], the [[Anglican Bishop of Southwark|Bishop of Southwark]], who put forward arguments against the film. Muggeridge and the Bishop, it was later claimed, had arrived 15 minutes late to see a screening of the picture prior to the debate, missing the establishing scenes demonstrating that Brian and Jesus were two different characters, and hence contended that it was a send-up of Christ himself.<ref name=\"autobiography\" /> Both Pythons later felt that there had been a strange role reversal in the manner of the debate, with two young upstart comedians attempting to make serious, well-researched points, while the Establishment figures engaged in cheap jibes and point scoring. They also expressed disappointment in Muggeridge, whom all in Python had previously respected as a satirist (he had recently converted to Christianity after meeting [[Mother Teresa]] and experiencing what he described as a miracle). Cleese expressed that his reputation had \"plummeted\" in his eyes, while Palin commented, \"He was just being Muggeridge, preferring to have a very strong contrary opinion as opposed to none at all.\"<ref name=\"autobiography\" /> Muggeridge's verdict on the film was that it was \"Such a tenth-rate film that it couldn't possibly destroy anyone's genuine faith.\" In a 2013 interview on [[BBC Radio 4]], Cleese stated that having recently watched the discussion again he \"was astonished, first of all, at how stupid [the two members of the Church] were, and how boring the debate became\".

The infighting among revolutionary organisations is demonstrated most dramatically when the PFJ attempts to kidnap Pontius Pilate's wife, but encounters agents of the Campaign for a Free Galilee, and the two factions begin a violent brawl over which of them conceived of the plan first. When Brian exhorts them to cease their fighting to struggle \"against the common enemy,\" the revolutionaries stop and cry in unison, \"the Judean People's Front!\" However, they soon resume their fighting and, with two Roman legionaries watching bemusedly, continue until Brian is left the only survivor, at which point he is captured.\n\nOther scenes have the freedom fighters wasting time in debate, with one of the debated items being that they should not waste their time debating so much. There is also a famous scene in which Reg gives a revolutionary speech asking, \"What have the Romans ever done for us?\" at which point the listeners outline all forms of positive aspects of the Roman occupation such as [[sanitation]], medicine, education, wine, [[public order]], [[irrigation]], roads, a [[fresh water]] system, [[public health]] and [[peace]], followed by \"what have the Romans ever done for us except sanitation, medicine, education...\". Python biographer George Perry notes, \"The People's Liberation Front of Judea conducts its meetings as though they have been convened by a group of [[Union steward|shop stewards]]\".<ref>Perry, George. ''The Life of Python'', Pavilion, 1994, p. 161</ref> This joke is the reverse of a similar conversation recorded in the Babylonian [[Talmud]];<ref>Babylonian Talmud, Shabbat 33. \"R. Simeon b. Johai [sic] said: 'All these things they have instituted for their own sake. Their markets are gathering-places for harlots; they have built baths for the purpose of indulging themselves in their comforts; they have built bridges to collect tolls from those who cross them.'\" Full text available at http://www.sacred-texts.com/jud/t01/t0110.htm</ref> some authors have even suggested the joke is based on the Talmudic text.<ref>https://css.ethz.ch/en/services/digital-library/articles/article.html/503413b7-2420-4fcf-9e4e-202190602ed5</ref>\n\n==Film analysis==\n===Themes and motifs===\n====  Bible ====\n\nThe depiction of Jesus in two short scenes at the start of the film are strongly based on Christian [[iconography]]. The resistance fighters left the [[Sermon on the Mount]], which was a literal recital, angry because Jesus was too pacifistic for them. (\"Well, blessed is just about everyone with a vested interest in the status quo\u2026\")<ref>cf. Tatum, p. 157</ref> Besides the respectful depiction of Jesus, the film doesn\u2019t suggest that there is no God or that Jesus isn\u2019t the son of God, according to most recipients/viewers. The appearance of a leper who was healed by Jesus, affirms the [[Gospels]] and their reports about Jesus performing miracles.<ref>cf. Tatum, pp. 151\u2013162</ref>\n\nAny direct reference to Jesus disappears after the introductory scenes, yet his life story partially acts as a framework and subtext for the story of Brian. Brian being a bastard of a Roman could refer to the [[polemic]] legend that Jesus was the son of the Roman soldier Panthera. Disguised as a prophet, Brian himself talks about \"the lilies on the field\" or states more clearly, \"Don\u2019t pass judgment on other people or else you might get judged yourself.\"<ref>cf. Tatum, p. 158</ref> It is safe to assume that Brian repeats incoherently everything he heard from Jesus.\n\nThere is another person in the film, besides Jesus, who is also named in the Gospels. It's [[Pontius Pilate]] and the character in the film is made to an absolute laughingstock. And although there is a hint to [[Barabbas]] previous to the crucifixion, there is no character in the Life of Brian, who bears any resemblances to [[Judas]] or [[Caiaphas]]. An anti-Semitic interpretation is therefore excluded, according to scholars. (\"Whether intended or not, this decision not to have a Caiaphas character avoids the possibility that the film might be viewed as anti-Semitic.\")<ref>cf. Tatum, p. 153</ref> The crucifixion, which is a main motive in Christian iconography, is viewed from a historical context within the narrative style of the film. Its enactment as a routinely done mass crucifixion left practicing Christians bewildered.<ref>cf. Hewison</ref>\n\n==== Belief and dogmatism ====\n\nThe intended subject of the satire was not Jesus and his teachings but religious [[dogmatism]], according to the concurrent observations made by film theorists and statements from Monty Python.<ref name=SinMPP> Shilbrack in ''Monty Python and Philosophy''. pp. 14\u201321. </ref><ref> cf. Tatum, pp.151\u2013162</ref> This is made clear in the beginning of the film during the Sermon on the Mount. Not only do the poor acoustics make it more difficult to hear what Jesus says, but the audience fails to interpret what was said correctly and sensibly. When Jesus said, \"blessed are the peacemakers\", the audience understands the phonetically similar word \"Cheesemakers\" and in turn interpret it as a metaphor and [[beatification]] of those who produce dairy products.<ref> Chapter 3 on ''Immaculate Edition DVD''</ref>\n\n''Life of Brian'' satirises, in the words of [[David Hume]], the \"strong propensity of mankind to [believe in] the extraordinary and the marvellous\".<ref>{{cite book |last1=Hume |first1=David |title=An Enquiry Concerning Human Understanding : Englisch/Deutsch (Reclams Universal-Bibliothek) |publisher=Reclam Verlag |isbn=9783159611884}}</ref> When Brian cuts his sermon short and turns away from the crowd, they mistake his behaviour as not wanting to share the secret to eternal life and follow him everywhere.<ref name=\"SinMPP\"/> In their need to submit to an authority, the crowd declares him first a prophet and eventually a messiah. The faithful gather beneath Brian's window en masse to receive God's blessing. This is when Brian utters the main message of the film \"you don't need to follow anybody! You've got to think for yourselves!\" Monty Python saw this central message of the satire confirmed with the protests of practicing Christians after the film was released.<ref name=\"Morgan\">{{cite book |last1=Morgan |first1=David |title=Monty Python speaks! |isbn=0380804794 |pages=[https://archive.org/details/montypythonspeak00morg/page/247 247-249] |url=https://archive.org/details/montypythonspeak00morg/page/247 }}</ref><ref name=\"Johnson\">{{cite book |last1=Johnson |first1=Kim \"Howard\" |title=The first 200 years of Monty Python |date=1990 |publisher=Plexus Publishing Limited |location=London |isbn=0-85965-107-X |pages=205\u2013213}}</ref>\n\nAccording to Terry Jones, ''Life of Brian'' \"is not [[blasphemy]] but [[heresy]]\",<ref>{{cite book |author=Chapman, Graham |display-authors=4 |author2=Cleese, John |author3=Gilliam, Terry |author4=Idle, Eric |author5=Jones, Terry |author6=Palin, Michael |author7=with McCabe, Bob |date=2003 |title=The Pythons Autobiography by The Pythons |location= London |publisher=Orion Publishing Group |isbn=0-7528-5293-0 |pages=272\u2013307}}</ref> because Brian contested the authority of the Church whereas the belief in God remained untouched. He goes on to mention that \"Christ [is] saying all of these wonderful things about people living together in peace and love, and then for the next two thousand years people are putting each other to death in His name because they can't agree on how He said it, or in what order He said it.\"<ref name=\"Morgan\" />  The dispute among the followers about the correct interpretation of a sandal, which Brian lost, is in the words of Terry Jones the \"history of the Church in three minutes.\"<ref name=\"Morgan\" /> Kevin Shilbrack shares the view that you can enjoy the movie and still be religious.<ref name=\"SinMPP\" />\n\nFor the most part, it was lost in the controversy that dogmatism among [[Left-wing_politics|left-wing]] parties was mocked in the film. According to John Cleese, an almost unmanageable number of left-wing organisations and parties was formed back then in the United Kingdom. He said that it had been so important to them to have one pure doctrine that they would rather fight each other than their political opponent.<ref> John Cleese, Chapter 7 on ''Immaculate Edition DVD''</ref> In the film, the leader of the People's Front of Judea makes it clear that their hate for the Judean Peoples's Front is greater than their hate for the Romans. They are so caught up in constant debates that the \"rather looney bunch of revolutionaries\"<ref> cf. Tatum, p.154</ref> indirectly accept the occupying forces as well as their execution methods as a fate they all have to endure. So, in the end they thank Brian for his sacrifice instead of rescuing him.''<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Schwebel |first1=Florian |title=Den Blumen eine Chance |journal=Schnitt-Das Filmmagazin |date=March 2007 |issue=47 |pages=27-28}}</ref>\n\nHardly mentioned in the discussion was the sideswipe at the [[women's movement]], which started to draw a lot of attention in the 1970s. In accordance with the language of political activists, resistance fighter Stan wants to use \u201chis right as a man\u201d to be a woman. The group accepts him from that moment on as Loretta, because the right to give birth was not theirs to take. Also as a result from that, the term sibling replaces the terms brother or sister.<ref> cf. Tatum, pp.151-162 </ref>\n\n==== Individuality and meaninglessness ====\n\n{{quote box|width=38%|bgcolor=#c6dbf7|align=right|quote=Brian: \"Look, you\u2019ve got it all wrong. You don't need to follow me. You don't need to follow anybody. You've got to think for yourselves. You're all individuals.\"<br />Crowd in unison: \"YES. WE'RE ALL INDIVIDUALS.\"}}\nOne of the most commented-upon scenes in the film is when Brian tells his followers that they are all individuals and don\u2019t need to follow anybody.<ref>{{cite news |title=49 of Monty Python's most absurdly funny jokes and quotes |url=https://www.yorkshirepost.co.uk/read-this/49-of-monty-pythons-most-absurdly-funny-jokes-and-quotes/ |accessdate=9 February 2020 |work=Yorkshire Post}}</ref> According to Edward Slowik, this is a scarce moment in which Monty Python puts a philosophical concept into words so openly and directly.<ref>Slowik in ''Monty Python and Philosophy'', p. 178 </ref> ''Life of Brian'' accurately depicts the [[Existentialism|existentialist]] view that everybody needs to give meaning to their own life.<ref>Slowik in ''Monty Python and Philosophy'', p. 179 </ref>\n\nBrian can thus be called an existentialist following the tradition of [[Friedrich Nietzsche]] and [[Jean-Paul Sartre]]. He is honest to himself and others and lives an authentic life as best as he can. However, Brian is too na\u00efve to be called a hero based on the ideas of [[Albert Camus]]. For Camus, the search for the meaning of one's own life takes place in a deeply meaningless and abstruse world. The \"[[Absurdism|absurd]] hero\" rebels against this meaninglessness and at the same time holds on to their goals, although they know their fight leaves no impact in the long run. Contrary to that, Brian isn\u2019t able to recognize the meaninglessness of his own situation and therefore can\u2019t triumph over it.<ref> Shilbrack in ''Monty Python and Philosophy'', pp.14\u201321 </ref>\n\nIn ''Monty Python and Philosophy'', Kevin Shilbrack states that the fundamental view of the film is that the world is absurd, and every life needs to be lived without a greater meaning. He points out that the second-last verse of the popular song \"[[Always Look on the Bright Side of Life]]\" would express this message clearly. \n\n:\"For life is quite absurd<br>\n:And death\u2019s the final word<br>\n:You must always face the curtain with a bow.<br>\n:Forget about your sin \u2013 give the audience a grin<br>\n:Enjoy it, it's your last chance anyhow.\"<br>\n\n\u2013 ''Life of Brian''\n\nShilbrack concludes that the finale shows that the executions had no purpose since the deaths were meaningless and no better world was waiting for them.<ref> Shilbrack in ''Monty Python and Philosophy'', p.20 </ref> On this note, some people  would claim that the film presents a [[nihilistic]] world view which contradicts any basis of religion.<ref> Shilbrack in ''Monty Python and Philosophy'', pp.14\u201321 </ref> However, ''Life of Brian'' offers humour to counterbalance the nihilism, Shilbrack states in his text. He comments that religion and humour are compatible with each other and you should laugh about the absurdity since you can't fight it.<ref> Shilbrack in ''Monty Python and Philosophy'', p.23</ref>\n\n==Legacy==\n===Literature===\nSpin-offs include a script-book ''[[Monty Python's The Life of Brian / Monty Python Scrapbook|The Life of Brian of Nazareth]]'', which was printed back-to-back with ''[[Monty Python's The Life of Brian / Monty Python Scrapbook|MONTYPYTHONSCRAPBOOK]]'' as a single book. The printing of this book also caused problems, due to rarely used laws in the United Kingdom against blasphemy, dictating what can and cannot be written about religion. The publisher refused to print both halves of the book, and original prints were by two companies.<ref>See Hewison.</ref>\n\nJulian Doyle, the film's editor, wrote ''The Life of Brian/Jesus'', a book which not only describes the filmmaking and editing process but argues that it is the most accurate Biblical film ever made. In October 2008, a memoir by [[Kim \"Howard\" Johnson]] titled ''Monty Python's Tunisian Holiday: My Life with Brian'' was released. Johnson became friendly with the Pythons during the filming of ''Life of Brian'' and his notes and memories of the behind-the-scenes filming and make-up.<ref>[http://www.thomasdunnebooks.com/TD_TitleDetail.aspx?ISBN=0312533799 ''Monty Python's Tunisian Holiday'' by Kim \"Howard\" Johnson at ThomasDunneBooks.com].

The [[oratorio]], called ''[[Not the Messiah (He's a Very Naughty Boy)]]'', was commissioned to be part of the festival called [[Luminato]] in Toronto in June 2007, and was written/scored by Idle and [[John Du Prez]], who also worked with Idle on ''Spamalot''.

It was also directed by Jones.

Brian later grows up an idealistic young man who resents the continuing [[Iudaea province|Roman occupation of Judea]]. While attending Jesus's [[Sermon on the Mount]], Brian becomes infatuated with an attractive young rebel, Judith. His desire for her and hatred for the Romans lead him to join the \"People's Front of Judea\", one of many fractious and bickering [[Zealots|independence movements]] who spend more time fighting each other than the Romans.\n\nAfter several misadventures, and escaping from [[Pontius Pilate]], Brian winds up in a line-up of would-be mystics and prophets who harangue the passing crowd in a plaza. Forced to come up with something plausible in order to blend in and keep the guards off his back, Brian repeats some of what he had heard Jesus say, and quickly attracts a small but intrigued audience. Once the guards have left, Brian tries to put the episode behind him, but he has unintentionally inspired a movement. He grows frantic when he finds that some people have started to follow him around, with even the slightest unusual occurrence being hailed as a [[miracle]]. Their responses grow in fervour and intensity, making it harder and harder for him to get away from them, yet because of the mob's excitement over the \"miracles\" they discover, they ultimately end up completely ignoring Brian himself.  Judith is the only one who does not leave; Brian and Judith then spend the night together. In the morning, Brian, completely naked, opens the curtains to discover an enormous crowd, which proclaims him to be the [[Messiah]], outside his mother's house. Brian's mother protests, telling the crowd that \"He's not the Messiah; he's a very naughty boy,\" and, \"There's no Messiah in here. There's a ''mess'', all right, but no Messiah.\" All of her attempts at dispersing the crowd are rebuffed. Furthermore, once Brian addresses them, he also finds that he is unable to change their minds. His followers are completely committed to their belief in Brian's divinity. They immediately seize upon everything he says and does as points of doctrine.\n\nThe hapless Brian is unable to escape his unwanted \"disciples\"; even his mother's house is surrounded by an enormous, enraptured crowd. They fling their afflicted bodies at him, demanding [[Faith healing|miracle cures]] and divine secrets. After sneaking out the back, Brian is then finally captured and scheduled to be [[Crucifixion|crucified]]. Meanwhile, yet another huge crowd has assembled outside the palace. Pontius Pilate (together with the visiting Biggus Dickus) tries to quell the feeling of revolution by granting them the choice of one person to be pardoned. The crowd, however, shouts out names containing the letter \"r\", mocking Pilate's [[rhotacism (speech impediment)|rhotacistic]] speech impediment. Eventually, Judith appears in the crowd and calls for the release of Brian, which the crowd echoes, since the name also contains an \"r\". Pilate agrees to \"welease Bwian\".<ref name=\"Welease\"/>\n\nHis order is eventually relayed to the guards, but in a scene that parodies the climax of the film ''[[Spartacus (film)|Spartacus]]'', various crucified people all claim to be \"Brian of Nazareth\" so they can be free and the wrong man is accidentally released. Various other opportunities for a reprieve for Brian are denied as, one by one, his \"allies\" (including Judith) step forward to explain why they are leaving the \"noble freedom fighter\" hanging in the hot sun, while his mother expresses regret for having raised him at all. Hope is renewed when a crack suicide squad from the \"Judean People's Front\" (not to be confused with the People's Front of Judea) come charging towards the Romans, but rather than fighting to release Brian or the other prisoners, they commit mass suicide as a form of political protest. Condemned to a slow and painful death, Brian finds his spirits lifted by his fellow sufferers, who cheerfully start singing \"[[Always Look on the Bright Side of Life]].\"<ref>{{cite book |first1=Alan |last1=Parker |first2=Mick |last2=O'Shea |date=2006 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=G49bRxbeH1kC&pg=PA106 |title=And Now For Something Completely Digital: The Complete Illustrated Guide to Monty Python CDs and DVDs |publisher=The Disinformation Company|isbn=9781932857313 }}</ref>\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Graham Chapman]] as Brian Cohen (of Nazareth), Biggus Dickus, 2nd wise man\n* [[John Cleese]] as Reg, [[High Priest of Israel|High priest]], Centurion of the Yard, Deadly Dirk, Arthur, 1st wise man\n* [[Terry Gilliam]] as Another person further forward (at Mount \u2013 \"Do you hear that?

Shortly after the release of ''[[Monty Python and the Holy Grail]]'' (1975), Eric Idle flippantly suggested that the title of the Pythons' forthcoming feature would be ''Jesus Christ \u2013 Lust for Glory'' (a play on the UK title for the 1970 American film ''[[Patton (film)|Patton]]'').<ref name=\"From Fringe to Flying Circus\">{{cite book |author=Wilmut, Roger |date=1980 |title=From Fringe to Flying Circus |location= London |publisher=Eyre Methuen Ltd |isbn=0-413-46950-6 |pages=247\u2013250}}</ref> This was after he had become frustrated at repeatedly being asked what it would be called, despite the troupe not having given the matter of a third film any consideration. However, they shared a distrust of organised religion, and, after witnessing the critically acclaimed ''Holy Grail''{{'}}s enormous financial turnover, confirming an appetite among the fans for more cinematic endeavours, they began to seriously consider a film lampooning the [[Christianity in the 1st century|New Testament era]] in the same way that ''Holy Grail'' had lampooned [[Arthurian legend]]. All they needed was an idea for a plot. Eric Idle and Terry Gilliam, while promoting ''Holy Grail'' in [[Amsterdam]], had come up with a sketch in which Jesus' cross is falling apart because of the idiotic carpenters who built it and he angrily tells them how to do it correctly. However, after an early [[brainstorming]] stage, and despite being non-believers, they agreed that Jesus was \"definitely a good guy\" and found nothing to mock in his actual teachings: \"He's not particularly funny, what he's saying isn't mockable, it's very decent stuff\", said Idle later.<ref name=\"autobiography\">{{cite book |author=Chapman, Graham |display-authors=4 |author2=Cleese, John |author3=Gilliam, Terry |author4=Idle, Eric |author5=Jones, Terry |author6=Palin, Michael |author7=with McCabe, Bob |date=2003 |title=The Pythons Autobiography by The Pythons |location= London |publisher=Orion Publishing Group |isbn=0-7528-5293-0 |pages=349\u2013387}}</ref> After settling on the name Brian for their new protagonist, one idea considered was that of \"the 13th disciple\".<ref name=\"From Fringe to Flying Circus\" /> The focus eventually shifted to a separate individual born at a similar time and location who would be mistaken for the Messiah, but had no desire to be followed as such.<ref name=\"Bevan\">Nathan Bevan (5 March 2011).

Gilliam again contributed two animated sequences (one being the opening credits) and took charge of [[set design]]. However, this did not put an absolute end to their feuding. On the DVD commentary, Gilliam expresses pride in one set in particular, the main hall of [[Antonia Fortress|Pilate's fortress]], which had been designed so that it looked like an ancient synagogue that the Romans had converted by dumping [[Roman architecture|their structural artefacts]] (such as marble floors and columns) on top. He reveals his consternation at Jones for not paying enough attention to it in the [[cinematography]]. Gilliam also worked on the [[Matte (filmmaking)|matte]] paintings, useful in particular for the very first shot of the three wise men against a star-scape and in giving the illusion of the whole of the outside of the fortress being covered in graffiti. Perhaps the most significant contribution from Gilliam was the scene in which Brian accidentally leaps off a high building and lands inside a starship about to engage in an interstellar war. This was done \"in camera\" using a hand-built model starship and miniature pyrotechnics, likely influenced by the recently released ''[[Star Wars (film)|Star Wars]]''. Afterwards, [[George Lucas]] met Terry Gilliam in San Francisco and praised him for his work.\n\nThe film was shot on location in [[Monastir, Tunisia|Monastir]], [[Tunisia]], which allowed the production to reuse sets from [[Franco Zeffirelli]]'s ''[[Jesus of Nazareth (film)|Jesus of Nazareth]]'' (1977).<ref>{{cite news |author=Ebert, Roger|date=18 June 2004 |title=Monty Python's Life of Brian|publisher=Digital Chicago|url=http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20040618/REVIEWS/406180301/1023 |accessdate=6 November 2006}}</ref> The Tunisian shoot was documented by [[Iain Johnstone]] for his BBC film ''[[The Pythons (film)|The Pythons]]''. Many locals were employed as extras on ''Life of Brian''.

Over the next few months ''Life of Brian'' was re-edited and re-screened a number of times for different preview audiences, losing a number of entire filmed sequences.<ref name=\"From Fringe to Flying Circus\" />\n\n===Editing===\nA number of scenes were cut during the editing process. Five [[deleted scene]]s, a total of 13 minutes, including the controversial \"Otto\", were first made available in 1997 on the [[Criterion Collection]] [[Laserdisc]].<ref>{{cite web|author=Laserdisc Database|title=Criterion Life of Brian|url=http://www.lddb.com/laserdisc/08009/CC1504L/Monty-Python:-Life-of-Brian:-Special-Edition-(1979)|accessdate=13 December 2011}}</ref> An unknown amount of raw footage was destroyed in 1998 by the company that bought Handmade Films. However, a number of them (of varying quality) were shown the following year on the [[Paramount Comedy Channel]] in the UK. The scenes shown included three shepherds discussing sheep and completely missing the arrival of the angel heralding Jesus's birth, which would have been at the very start of the film; a segment showing the attempted kidnap of Pilate's wife (a large woman played by John Case<!--Please don't change \"Case\" to \"Cleese\"; it's not a typo-->) whose escape results in a fistfight; a scene introducing hardline [[Zionist]] Otto, leader of the Judean People's Front (played by Eric Idle) and his men who practise a suicide run in the courtyard; and a brief scene in which Judith releases some birds into the air in an attempt to summon help.

The logo of the Judean People's Front, designed by Terry Gilliam,<ref name=\"immaculate\">{{cite video |date=2007 |title=The Story of Brian |medium=Monty Python's Life of Brian: The Immaculate Edition DVD |publisher= [[Sony Pictures Home Entertainment]]}}</ref> was a [[Star of David]] with a small line added to each point so it resembled a [[swastika]], most familiar in the West as the symbol of the anti-Semitic Nazi movement. The rest of this faction also all had the same thin moustaches, and wore a spike on their helmets, similar to those on [[Pickelhaube|Imperial German helmets]]. The official reason for the cutting was that Otto's dialogue slowed down the narrative. However, Gilliam, writing in ''The Pythons Autobiography by The Pythons'', said he thought it should have stayed, saying \"Listen, we've alienated the Christians, let's get the Jews now.\" Idle himself was said to have been uncomfortable with the character; \"It's essentially a pretty savage attack on rabid Zionism, suggesting it's rather akin to Nazism, which is a bit strong to take, but certainly a point of view.\"<ref name=\"autobiography\" /> [[Michael Palin]]'s personal journal entries from the period when various edits of ''Brian'' were being test-screened consistently reference the Pythons' and filmmakers' concerns that the Otto scenes were slowing the story down and thus were top of the list to be chopped from the final cut of the film.<ref name=\"autogenerated1969\" /> However, [[Oxford Brookes University]] historian David Nash says the removal of the scene represented \"a form of self-censorship\" and the Otto sequence \"which involved a character representative of extreme forms of [[Zionism]]\" was cut \"in the interests of smoothing the way for the film's distribution in America.\"<ref>{{cite book |last=Nash |first=David |title=Blasphemy in the Christian World: A History |publisher=Oxford University Press |date=2007 |page=214 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OIA_i8jviucC&lpg=PA214&dq=%22in%20the%20interests%22%20%22Blasphemy%20in%20the%20Christian%20world%22%20%22David%20Nash%22&pg=PA214#v=onepage&q=zionism&f=false |accessdate=18 May 2010 |isbn=978-0-19-925516-0}}</ref>\n\nThe only scene with Otto that remains in the film is during the [[crucifixion]] sequence. Otto arrives with his \"crack suicide squad\", sending the Roman soldiers fleeing in terror. Instead of doing anything useful, they \"attack\" by committing mass suicide in front of the cross (\"Zat showed 'em, huh?\" says the dying Otto, to which Brian despondently replies \"You silly sods!\"), ending Brian's hope of rescue (they do however show some signs of life during the famous rendition of \"[[Always Look on the Bright Side of Life]]\" when they are seen waving their toes in unison in time to the music). Terry Jones once mentioned that the only reason this excerpt was not cut too was due to [[continuity (fiction)|continuity]] reasons, as their dead bodies were very prominently placed throughout the rest of the scene. He acknowledged that some of the humour of this sole remaining contribution was lost through the earlier edits, but felt they were necessary to the overall pacing.\n\nOtto's scenes, and those with Pilate's wife, were cut from the film after the script had gone to the publishers, and so they can be found in the published version of the script. Also present is a scene where, after Brian has led the [[Legio V Macedonica|Fifth Legion]] to the headquarters of the People's Front of Judea, Reg ([[John Cleese]]) says \"You cunt!! You stupid, bird-brained, flat-headed...\"<ref>{{cite book |author=Chapman, Graham |display-authors=etal |date=1979 |title=Monty Python's The Life of Brian/MONTYPYTHONSCRAPBOOK |pages=script p.34 |nopp=true|title-link=Monty Python's The Life of Brian/MONTYPYTHONSCRAPBOOK }}</ref> The profanity was overdubbed to \"you klutz\" before the film was released. Cleese approved of this editing as he felt the reaction to the [[four-letter word]] would \"get in the way of the comedy.\"<ref name=\"autobiography\" />\n\nAn early listing of the sequence of sketches reprinted in ''Monty Python: The Case Against'' by Robert Hewison reveals that the film was to have begun with a set of sketches at an English public school. Much of this material was first printed in the ''[[Monty Python's The Life of Brian / Monty Python Scrapbook]]'' that accompanied the original script publication of ''The Life of Brian'' and then subsequently reused. The song \"[[All Things Dull and Ugly]]\" and the parody scripture reading \"Martyrdom of St. Victor\" were performed on ''[[Monty Python's Contractual Obligation Album]]'' (1980). The idea of a violent rugby match between school masters and small boys was filmed in ''[[Monty Python's The Meaning of Life]]'' (1983). A sketch about a boy who dies at school appeared on the unreleased ''[[The Hastily Cobbled Together for a Fast Buck Album]]'' (1981).\n\n==Soundtrack==\n{{main|Monty Python's Life of Brian (album)}}\nAn album was also released by Monty Python in 1979 in conjunction with the film. In addition to the \"[[Brian Song]]\"  and \"[[Always Look on the Bright Side of Life]]\", it contains scenes from the film with brief linking sections performed by Eric Idle and Graham Chapman. The album opens with a brief rendition of \"[[Hava Nagila]]\" on Scottish bagpipes. A CD version was released in 1997.\n\nAn album of the songs sung in ''[[Monty Python's Life of Brian (album)|Monty Python's Life of Brian]]'' was released on the Disky label. \"Always Look on the Bright Side of Life\" was later re-released with great success, after being sung by British [[Association football|football]] fans. Its popularity became truly evident in 1982 during the [[Falklands War]] when sailors aboard the destroyer [[HMS Sheffield (D80)|HMS ''Sheffield'']], severely damaged in an Argentinean [[Exocet]] missile attack on 4 May, started singing it while awaiting rescue.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.icons.org.uk/nom/nominations/always-look-on-the-bright-side-of-life|title=Icons of England, \"Always Look on the Bright Side of Life\"|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110717050535/http://www.icons.org.uk/nom/nominations/always-look-on-the-bright-side-of-life|archivedate=17 July 2011|df=dmy-all}}</ref><ref>\n{{cite news|url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/comment/columnists/ben_macintyre/article2835095.ece|title=Always look on the bright side of strife: The sardonic humour of war|work=The Times |location=UK |date=9 November 2007 | accessdate=5 April 2010 | first=Ben | last=MacIntyre}}</ref> Many people have come to see the song as a life-affirming ode to [[optimism]].

It consisted mostly of stock travelogue footage and featured arch comments from Cleese. For instance, a shot of Bulgarian girls in ceremonial dresses was accompanied by the comment \"Hard to believe, isn't it, that these simple happy folk are dedicated to the destruction of Western Civilisation as we know it!\", [[Communist Bulgaria]] being a member of the [[Warsaw Pact]] at the time. Not only was this a spoof of travelogues ''per se'', it was a protest against the then common practice in Britain of showing cheaply made banal short features before a main feature.\n\n''Life of Brian'' opened on 17 August 1979 in five North American theatres and grossed US$140,034 ($28,007 per screen) in its opening weekend. Its total gross was $19,398,164. It was the highest grossing British film in North America that year.

It grossed $26,376 ($5,275 per screen) in its opening weekend. It ran until October 2004, playing at 28 screens at its widest point, eventually grossing $646,124 during its re-release. By comparison, a re-release of ''[[Monty Python and the Holy Grail]]'' had earned $1.8 million three years earlier. A DVD of the film was also released that year.\n\n==Reception==\nReviews from critics were mostly positive on the film's release.

This is reinforced by the fact that several characters throughout the film claim crucifixion is not as bad as it seems. For example, when Brian asks his cellmate in prison what will happen to him, he replies: \"Oh, you'll probably get away with crucifixion\". In another example, an old man who works with the People's Front of Judea dismisses crucifixion as \"a doddle\" and says being stabbed would be worse.\n\nThe director, Terry Jones, issued the following riposte to this criticism: \"Any religion that makes a form of torture into an icon that they worship seems to me a pretty sick sort of religion quite honestly.\"<ref name=\"Channel 4\" /> The Pythons also pointed out that crucifixion was a standard form of execution in ancient times and not just one especially reserved for Jesus.<ref>{{cite book |title=Ancient Jewish and Christian Perceptions of Crucifixion |first=David W. |last=Chapman |page=44 |publisher=Mohr Siebeck |date=2008 |isbn=978-3-16-149579-3}}</ref>\n\n===Responses from the cast===\nShortly after the film was released, Cleese and Palin engaged in a [[Friday Night, Saturday Morning#Monty Python's Life of Brian|debate]] on the [[BBC Two|BBC2]] discussion programme ''[[Friday Night, Saturday Morning]]'' with [[Malcolm Muggeridge]] and [[Mervyn Stockwood]], the [[Anglican Bishop of Southwark|Bishop of Southwark]], who put forward arguments against the film. Muggeridge and the Bishop, it was later claimed, had arrived 15 minutes late to see a screening of the picture prior to the debate, missing the establishing scenes demonstrating that Brian and Jesus were two different characters, and hence contended that it was a send-up of Christ himself.<ref name=\"autobiography\" /> Both Pythons later felt that there had been a strange role reversal in the manner of the debate, with two young upstart comedians attempting to make serious, well-researched points, while the Establishment figures engaged in cheap jibes and point scoring. They also expressed disappointment in Muggeridge, whom all in Python had previously respected as a satirist (he had recently converted to Christianity after meeting [[Mother Teresa]] and experiencing what he described as a miracle). Cleese expressed that his reputation had \"plummeted\" in his eyes, while Palin commented, \"He was just being Muggeridge, preferring to have a very strong contrary opinion as opposed to none at all.\"<ref name=\"autobiography\" /> Muggeridge's verdict on the film was that it was \"Such a tenth-rate film that it couldn't possibly destroy anyone's genuine faith.\" In a 2013 interview on [[BBC Radio 4]], Cleese stated that having recently watched the discussion again he \"was astonished, first of all, at how stupid [the two members of the Church] were, and how boring the debate became\". He added: \"I think the sad thing was that there was absolutely no attempt at a proper discussion \u2013 no attempt to find any common ground.\"<ref>[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-25464820 Cleese and Palin relive the 1979 Life of Brian debate], BBC News.

Crossley points out that the film uses a number of potentially controversial scholarly theories about Jesus but now with reference to Brian, such as the [[Messianic Secret]], the Jewishness of Jesus, Jesus the revolutionary, and having a single mother.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Crossley |first=James |date=2011 |title=Life of Brian or Life of Jesus?

The infighting among revolutionary organisations is demonstrated most dramatically when the PFJ attempts to kidnap Pontius Pilate's wife, but encounters agents of the Campaign for a Free Galilee, and the two factions begin a violent brawl over which of them conceived of the plan first. When Brian exhorts them to cease their fighting to struggle \"against the common enemy,\" the revolutionaries stop and cry in unison, \"the Judean People's Front!\" However, they soon resume their fighting and, with two Roman legionaries watching bemusedly, continue until Brian is left the only survivor, at which point he is captured.\n\nOther scenes have the freedom fighters wasting time in debate, with one of the debated items being that they should not waste their time debating so much. There is also a famous scene in which Reg gives a revolutionary speech asking, \"What have the Romans ever done for us?\" at which point the listeners outline all forms of positive aspects of the Roman occupation such as [[sanitation]], medicine, education, wine, [[public order]], [[irrigation]], roads, a [[fresh water]] system, [[public health]] and [[peace]], followed by \"what have the Romans ever done for us except sanitation, medicine, education...\". Python biographer George Perry notes, \"The People's Liberation Front of Judea conducts its meetings as though they have been convened by a group of [[Union steward|shop stewards]]\".<ref>Perry, George. ''The Life of Python'', Pavilion, 1994, p. 161</ref> This joke is the reverse of a similar conversation recorded in the Babylonian [[Talmud]];<ref>Babylonian Talmud, Shabbat 33. \"R. Simeon b. Johai [sic] said: 'All these things they have instituted for their own sake. Their markets are gathering-places for harlots; they have built baths for the purpose of indulging themselves in their comforts; they have built bridges to collect tolls from those who cross them.'\" Full text available at http://www.sacred-texts.com/jud/t01/t0110.htm</ref> some authors have even suggested the joke is based on the Talmudic text.<ref>https://css.ethz.ch/en/services/digital-library/articles/article.html/503413b7-2420-4fcf-9e4e-202190602ed5</ref>\n\n==Film analysis==\n===Themes and motifs===\n====  Bible ====\n\nThe depiction of Jesus in two short scenes at the start of the film are strongly based on Christian [[iconography]]. The resistance fighters left the [[Sermon on the Mount]], which was a literal recital, angry because Jesus was too pacifistic for them. (\"Well, blessed is just about everyone with a vested interest in the status quo\u2026\")<ref>cf. Tatum, p. 157</ref> Besides the respectful depiction of Jesus, the film doesn\u2019t suggest that there is no God or that Jesus isn\u2019t the son of God, according to most recipients/viewers. The appearance of a leper who was healed by Jesus, affirms the [[Gospels]] and their reports about Jesus performing miracles.<ref>cf. Tatum, pp. 151\u2013162</ref>\n\nAny direct reference to Jesus disappears after the introductory scenes, yet his life story partially acts as a framework and subtext for the story of Brian. Brian being a bastard of a Roman could refer to the [[polemic]] legend that Jesus was the son of the Roman soldier Panthera. Disguised as a prophet, Brian himself talks about \"the lilies on the field\" or states more clearly, \"Don\u2019t pass judgment on other people or else you might get judged yourself.\"<ref>cf. Tatum, p. 158</ref> It is safe to assume that Brian repeats incoherently everything he heard from Jesus.\n\nThere is another person in the film, besides Jesus, who is also named in the Gospels. It's [[Pontius Pilate]] and the character in the film is made to an absolute laughingstock. And although there is a hint to [[Barabbas]] previous to the crucifixion, there is no character in the Life of Brian, who bears any resemblances to [[Judas]] or [[Caiaphas]]. An anti-Semitic interpretation is therefore excluded, according to scholars. (\"Whether intended or not, this decision not to have a Caiaphas character avoids the possibility that the film might be viewed as anti-Semitic.\")<ref>cf. Tatum, p. 153</ref> The crucifixion, which is a main motive in Christian iconography, is viewed from a historical context within the narrative style of the film. Its enactment as a routinely done mass crucifixion left practicing Christians bewildered.<ref>cf. Hewison</ref>\n\n==== Belief and dogmatism ====\n\nThe intended subject of the satire was not Jesus and his teachings but religious [[dogmatism]], according to the concurrent observations made by film theorists and statements from Monty Python.<ref name=SinMPP> Shilbrack in ''Monty Python and Philosophy''. pp. 14\u201321. </ref><ref> cf. Tatum, pp.151\u2013162</ref> This is made clear in the beginning of the film during the Sermon on the Mount. Not only do the poor acoustics make it more difficult to hear what Jesus says, but the audience fails to interpret what was said correctly and sensibly. When Jesus said, \"blessed are the peacemakers\", the audience understands the phonetically similar word \"Cheesemakers\" and in turn interpret it as a metaphor and [[beatification]] of those who produce dairy products.<ref> Chapter 3 on ''Immaculate Edition DVD''</ref>\n\n''Life of Brian'' satirises, in the words of [[David Hume]], the \"strong propensity of mankind to [believe in] the extraordinary and the marvellous\".<ref>{{cite book |last1=Hume |first1=David |title=An Enquiry Concerning Human Understanding : Englisch/Deutsch (Reclams Universal-Bibliothek) |publisher=Reclam Verlag |isbn=9783159611884}}</ref> When Brian cuts his sermon short and turns away from the crowd, they mistake his behaviour as not wanting to share the secret to eternal life and follow him everywhere.<ref name=\"SinMPP\"/> In their need to submit to an authority, the crowd declares him first a prophet and eventually a messiah. The faithful gather beneath Brian's window en masse to receive God's blessing. This is when Brian utters the main message of the film \"you don't need to follow anybody! You've got to think for yourselves!\" Monty Python saw this central message of the satire confirmed with the protests of practicing Christians after the film was released.<ref name=\"Morgan\">{{cite book |last1=Morgan |first1=David |title=Monty Python speaks! |isbn=0380804794 |pages=[https://archive.org/details/montypythonspeak00morg/page/247 247-249] |url=https://archive.org/details/montypythonspeak00morg/page/247 }}</ref><ref name=\"Johnson\">{{cite book |last1=Johnson |first1=Kim \"Howard\" |title=The first 200 years of Monty Python |date=1990 |publisher=Plexus Publishing Limited |location=London |isbn=0-85965-107-X |pages=205\u2013213}}</ref>\n\nAccording to Terry Jones, ''Life of Brian'' \"is not [[blasphemy]] but [[heresy]]\",<ref>{{cite book |author=Chapman, Graham |display-authors=4 |author2=Cleese, John |author3=Gilliam, Terry |author4=Idle, Eric |author5=Jones, Terry |author6=Palin, Michael |author7=with McCabe, Bob |date=2003 |title=The Pythons Autobiography by The Pythons |location= London |publisher=Orion Publishing Group |isbn=0-7528-5293-0 |pages=272\u2013307}}</ref> because Brian contested the authority of the Church whereas the belief in God remained untouched. He goes on to mention that \"Christ [is] saying all of these wonderful things about people living together in peace and love, and then for the next two thousand years people are putting each other to death in His name because they can't agree on how He said it, or in what order He said it.\"<ref name=\"Morgan\" />  The dispute among the followers about the correct interpretation of a sandal, which Brian lost, is in the words of Terry Jones the \"history of the Church in three minutes.\"<ref name=\"Morgan\" /> Kevin Shilbrack shares the view that you can enjoy the movie and still be religious.<ref name=\"SinMPP\" />\n\nFor the most part, it was lost in the controversy that dogmatism among [[Left-wing_politics|left-wing]] parties was mocked in the film. According to John Cleese, an almost unmanageable number of left-wing organisations and parties was formed back then in the United Kingdom. He said that it had been so important to them to have one pure doctrine that they would rather fight each other than their political opponent.<ref> John Cleese, Chapter 7 on ''Immaculate Edition DVD''</ref> In the film, the leader of the People's Front of Judea makes it clear that their hate for the Judean Peoples's Front is greater than their hate for the Romans. They are so caught up in constant debates that the \"rather looney bunch of revolutionaries\"<ref> cf. Tatum, p.154</ref> indirectly accept the occupying forces as well as their execution methods as a fate they all have to endure. So, in the end they thank Brian for his sacrifice instead of rescuing him.''<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Schwebel |first1=Florian |title=Den Blumen eine Chance |journal=Schnitt-Das Filmmagazin |date=March 2007 |issue=47 |pages=27-28}}</ref>\n\nHardly mentioned in the discussion was the sideswipe at the [[women's movement]], which started to draw a lot of attention in the 1970s. In accordance with the language of political activists, resistance fighter Stan wants to use \u201chis right as a man\u201d to be a woman. The group accepts him from that moment on as Loretta, because the right to give birth was not theirs to take. Also as a result from that, the term sibling replaces the terms brother or sister.<ref> cf. Tatum, pp.151-162 </ref>\n\n==== Individuality and meaninglessness ====\n\n{{quote box|width=38%|bgcolor=#c6dbf7|align=right|quote=Brian: \"Look, you\u2019ve got it all wrong. You don't need to follow me. You don't need to follow anybody. You've got to think for yourselves. You're all individuals.\"<br />Crowd in unison: \"YES. WE'RE ALL INDIVIDUALS.\"}}\nOne of the most commented-upon scenes in the film is when Brian tells his followers that they are all individuals and don\u2019t need to follow anybody.<ref>{{cite news |title=49 of Monty Python's most absurdly funny jokes and quotes |url=https://www.yorkshirepost.co.uk/read-this/49-of-monty-pythons-most-absurdly-funny-jokes-and-quotes/ |accessdate=9 February 2020 |work=Yorkshire Post}}</ref> According to Edward Slowik, this is a scarce moment in which Monty Python puts a philosophical concept into words so openly and directly.<ref>Slowik in ''Monty Python and Philosophy'', p. 178 </ref> ''Life of Brian'' accurately depicts the [[Existentialism|existentialist]] view that everybody needs to give meaning to their own life.<ref>Slowik in ''Monty Python and Philosophy'', p. 179 </ref>\n\nBrian can thus be called an existentialist following the tradition of [[Friedrich Nietzsche]] and [[Jean-Paul Sartre]]. He is honest to himself and others and lives an authentic life as best as he can. However, Brian is too na\u00efve to be called a hero based on the ideas of [[Albert Camus]]. For Camus, the search for the meaning of one's own life takes place in a deeply meaningless and abstruse world. The \"[[Absurdism|absurd]] hero\" rebels against this meaninglessness and at the same time holds on to their goals, although they know their fight leaves no impact in the long run. Contrary to that, Brian isn\u2019t able to recognize the meaninglessness of his own situation and therefore can\u2019t triumph over it.<ref> Shilbrack in ''Monty Python and Philosophy'', pp.14\u201321 </ref>\n\nIn ''Monty Python and Philosophy'', Kevin Shilbrack states that the fundamental view of the film is that the world is absurd, and every life needs to be lived without a greater meaning. He points out that the second-last verse of the popular song \"[[Always Look on the Bright Side of Life]]\" would express this message clearly. \n\n:\"For life is quite absurd<br>\n:And death\u2019s the final word<br>\n:You must always face the curtain with a bow.<br>\n:Forget about your sin \u2013 give the audience a grin<br>\n:Enjoy it, it's your last chance anyhow.\"<br>\n\n\u2013 ''Life of Brian''\n\nShilbrack concludes that the finale shows that the executions had no purpose since the deaths were meaningless and no better world was waiting for them.<ref> Shilbrack in ''Monty Python and Philosophy'', p.20 </ref> On this note, some people  would claim that the film presents a [[nihilistic]] world view which contradicts any basis of religion.<ref> Shilbrack in ''Monty Python and Philosophy'', pp.14\u201321 </ref> However, ''Life of Brian'' offers humour to counterbalance the nihilism, Shilbrack states in his text. He comments that religion and humour are compatible with each other and you should laugh about the absurdity since you can't fight it.<ref> Shilbrack in ''Monty Python and Philosophy'', p.23</ref>\n\n==Legacy==\n===Literature===\nSpin-offs include a script-book ''[[Monty Python's The Life of Brian / Monty Python Scrapbook|The Life of Brian of Nazareth]]'', which was printed back-to-back with ''[[Monty Python's The Life of Brian / Monty Python Scrapbook|MONTYPYTHONSCRAPBOOK]]'' as a single book. The printing of this book also caused problems, due to rarely used laws in the United Kingdom against blasphemy, dictating what can and cannot be written about religion. The publisher refused to print both halves of the book, and original prints were by two companies.<ref>See Hewison.</ref>\n\nJulian Doyle, the film's editor, wrote ''The Life of Brian/Jesus'', a book which not only describes the filmmaking and editing process but argues that it is the most accurate Biblical film ever made. In October 2008, a memoir by [[Kim \"Howard\" Johnson]] titled ''Monty Python's Tunisian Holiday: My Life with Brian'' was released. Johnson became friendly with the Pythons during the filming of ''Life of Brian'' and his notes and memories of the behind-the-scenes filming and make-up.<ref>[http://www.thomasdunnebooks.com/TD_TitleDetail.aspx?ISBN=0312533799 ''Monty Python's Tunisian Holiday'' by Kim \"Howard\" Johnson at ThomasDunneBooks.com].

The [[oratorio]], called ''[[Not the Messiah (He's a Very Naughty Boy)]]'', was commissioned to be part of the festival called [[Luminato]] in Toronto in June 2007, and was written/scored by Idle and [[John Du Prez]], who also worked with Idle on ''Spamalot''.

However, they are not required to be fluent in French to be admitted, as there is a special one-year ''Fran\u00e7ais Sp\u00e9cial'' language program. The academic curriculum of the international sections supplements the standard French curriculum with additional courses in literature/language and history/geography, taught in the language of the students' respective national sections, allowing them to pursue the [[Baccalaur\u00e9at#Option Internationale du Baccalaur.C3.A9at|''option internationale du baccalaur\u00e9at'']] (OIB), the international variant of the French ''baccalaur\u00e9at''.\n \nThe school's main campus at 2 bis rue du Fer \u00e0 Cheval ({{coord|48|53|44|N|2|3|40|E}}) in Saint-Germain-en-Laye contains a preschool (''maternelle''), a primary school (''\u00e9cole \u00e9l\u00e9mentaire''), a middle school (''coll\u00e8ge''), and an upper school (''lyc\u00e9e'').

The SHAPE Village Project was built in the grounds of the {{Interlanguage link multi|Ch\u00e2teau d'Hennemont|fr}} to accommodate 1,500 officers and soldiers from 13 nationalities, and their families. SHAPE Supreme Commander General Dwight D. Eisenhower decided to create a school for the children of the officers, which he hoped would help SHAPE's multi-national families to live and work together in harmony.\n\nThe SHAPE village school opened in January 1952, under the direction of [[Ren\u00e9 Tallard]]. By the end of the school year, 400 children were on the register, including 200 [[French language|French]] children, half of them inhabitants of the town. Two years later, in 1954, the school was officially renamed the NATO International School (l\u2019Ecole Internationale de l\u2019OTAN).\n\nFunding from SHAPE provided the school with equipment and accommodation, including a new flagship building completed in 1960. From 1961, senior students prepared for the [[Dipl\u00f4me des Ecoles Internationales]] and the following year, the school was renamed the [[NATO]] International Lyc\u00e9e (Lyc\u00e9e International de l\u2019OTAN). The founding proviseur, [[Ren\u00e9 Tallard]], retired in 1965.\n\n===1965\u20131989===\n\nNot only did 1965 mark the retirement of the much respected M Tallard, it was also the year in which President de Gaulle decided to pull France out of NATO\u2019s military operations. NATO, and SHAPE, were forced to find a new European base, in [https://shape.nato.int/shapeinternationalschool Belgium], and the Lyc\u00e9e International de l\u2019OTAN lost two thirds of its pupils at a stroke. It was an immediate challenge for the new proviseur, [[Edgar Scherer]]. His was the delicate task of working with the remaining two public sections \u2013 the German and the Dutch \u2013 to persuade the educational authorities, both in France and overseas, to rebuild the life of the school which, would from now on need to count on the support of \"economic expatriates\" to replace those of the original military community. \n\nBy 1968, under Scherer\u2019s leadership and direction, the school was building up strength with six sections \u2013 German, Dutch, British, American, Danish and Italian.\n\n===1989\u2013present===\n\nScherer\u2019s successor, [[Jean Pierre Maillard|Jean-Pierre Maillard]], had a different challenge: modernising the infrastructure of a school, which had been expanding again over more than twenty years. Replacing pre-fabricated buildings with more lasting structures was now a priority.\n\nThanks to state funding, the result was a new campus, including a fine new primary building. Under Maillard, other projects advanced too: the development of the network of partner schools, the drafting of a \"projet d\u2019\u00e9tablissement\", the creation of the Japanese section in 1993; the embracing of the Option Internationale du Baccalaur\u00e9at as the final exam for senior Lyc\u00e9e students, and the renovation of the chateau.\n\nIn 1997, Maillard handed the baton on to [[Patrick Charpeil]], who focused attention on the administrative complexities of the school, clarifying the legal basis of the Lyc\u00e9e and its component parts. Charpeil continued to oversee the restoration of the chateau and successfully liaised and lobbied with the supervising educational authorities to advance important projects concerning security, major improvements and maintenance.\n\n[[Yves Lemaire]] took over the helm in September 2001 until September 2012. The challenges were as stimulating as ever: the final stages of renovation and the future use of the chateau; the pressure for increasing the number of classes at Lyc\u00e9e level; nationwide administration of the OIB; the creation of the Polish section at Coll\u00e8ge and Lyc\u00e9e level (in 2002/3) and the consolidation of the legal status of the school via a new decree.\n\nHis successor, Joel Bianco officially took office as the new proviseur in September 2012. He directed the lyc\u00e9e from 2012 to 2016, integrating the Chinese Section. Isabelle Negral was proviseur from 2016 to 2019. She oversaw a major renovation, which included the creation of new secondary buildings, a new preschool building, and a state-of-the art gymnasium, as well as the renovation of the Agora, which will host the CDI, the Maison des Lyc\u00e9ens, meeting rooms, and a center for the arts. France Bessis became proviseur of the school in 2019. \n\n\n== Academics ==\nThe curriculum at the Lyc\u00e9e International combines the French national curriculum with the curriculum of one of the national sections. French Education National teachers teach subjects to French national standards and the school's foreign teachers \u2013 employed in one of the system\u2019s fourteen national sections \u2013 are given the freedom and responsibility to teach literature, language and history to their own national standards. These additional classes in the national sections provide (on a weekly basis):\n\n*Six hours of language class in the primary school\n*Six hours in the middles school, including four hours of literature/language and two hours of history\n*Eight hours in the upper school, usually divided into four hours of literature/language and four hours of history/geography**\n\n(**American Section students have five hours of literature/language and three hours of history/geography, as do Polish Section students. Japanese Section students have six hours of literature/language and two hours of history/geography. Chinese section students take math courses during section time instead of history.)\n\nSince the French curriculum requires learning at least two foreign language, many students who graduate from the Lyc\u00e9e International are fluent in four languages.\n\nStudents who do not speak French are placed in a French immersion program called ''Fran\u00e7ais Sp\u00e9cial''. After one year, they are expected to be fluent in French and integrate the standard French curriculum along with the rest of the student population.\n\nLyc\u00e9e International students must take the international variation on the ''baccalaur\u00e9at'', called the OIB ([[Baccalaur\u00e9at#Variations on the general baccalaur\u00e9at|Option Internationale du baccalaur\u00e9at]]), in order to take advantage of their language skills.\nBaccalaureat results at the Lyc\u00e9e International de Saint Germain-en-Laye fluctuate between 99% and 100%, and an honors (''mention'') rate which is above 90%.

However, they are not required to be fluent in French to be admitted, as there is a special one-year ''Fran\u00e7ais Sp\u00e9cial'' language program. The academic curriculum of the international sections supplements the standard French curriculum with additional courses in literature/language and history/geography, taught in the language of the students' respective national sections, allowing them to pursue the [[Baccalaur\u00e9at#Option Internationale du Baccalaur.C3.A9at|''option internationale du baccalaur\u00e9at'']] (OIB), the international variant of the French ''baccalaur\u00e9at''.\n \nThe school's main campus at 2 bis rue du Fer \u00e0 Cheval ({{coord|48|53|44|N|2|3|40|E}}) in Saint-Germain-en-Laye contains a preschool (''maternelle''), a primary school (''\u00e9cole \u00e9l\u00e9mentaire''), a middle school (''coll\u00e8ge''), and an upper school (''lyc\u00e9e'').

The SHAPE Village Project was built in the grounds of the {{Interlanguage link multi|Ch\u00e2teau d'Hennemont|fr}} to accommodate 1,500 officers and soldiers from 13 nationalities, and their families. SHAPE Supreme Commander General Dwight D. Eisenhower decided to create a school for the children of the officers, which he hoped would help SHAPE's multi-national families to live and work together in harmony.\n\nThe SHAPE village school opened in January 1952, under the direction of [[Ren\u00e9 Tallard]]. By the end of the school year, 400 children were on the register, including 200 [[French language|French]] children, half of them inhabitants of the town. Two years later, in 1954, the school was officially renamed the NATO International School (l\u2019Ecole Internationale de l\u2019OTAN).\n\nFunding from SHAPE provided the school with equipment and accommodation, including a new flagship building completed in 1960. From 1961, senior students prepared for the [[Dipl\u00f4me des Ecoles Internationales]] and the following year, the school was renamed the [[NATO]] International Lyc\u00e9e (Lyc\u00e9e International de l\u2019OTAN). The founding proviseur, [[Ren\u00e9 Tallard]], retired in 1965.\n\n===1965\u20131989===\n\nNot only did 1965 mark the retirement of the much respected M Tallard, it was also the year in which President de Gaulle decided to pull France out of NATO\u2019s military operations. NATO, and SHAPE, were forced to find a new European base, in [https://shape.nato.int/shapeinternationalschool Belgium], and the Lyc\u00e9e International de l\u2019OTAN lost two thirds of its pupils at a stroke. It was an immediate challenge for the new proviseur, [[Edgar Scherer]]. His was the delicate task of working with the remaining two public sections \u2013 the German and the Dutch \u2013 to persuade the educational authorities, both in France and overseas, to rebuild the life of the school which, would from now on need to count on the support of \"economic expatriates\" to replace those of the original military community. \n\nBy 1968, under Scherer\u2019s leadership and direction, the school was building up strength with six sections \u2013 German, Dutch, British, American, Danish and Italian.\n\n===1989\u2013present===\n\nScherer\u2019s successor, [[Jean Pierre Maillard|Jean-Pierre Maillard]], had a different challenge: modernising the infrastructure of a school, which had been expanding again over more than twenty years. Replacing pre-fabricated buildings with more lasting structures was now a priority.\n\nThanks to state funding, the result was a new campus, including a fine new primary building. Under Maillard, other projects advanced too: the development of the network of partner schools, the drafting of a \"projet d\u2019\u00e9tablissement\", the creation of the Japanese section in 1993; the embracing of the Option Internationale du Baccalaur\u00e9at as the final exam for senior Lyc\u00e9e students, and the renovation of the chateau.\n\nIn 1997, Maillard handed the baton on to [[Patrick Charpeil]], who focused attention on the administrative complexities of the school, clarifying the legal basis of the Lyc\u00e9e and its component parts. Charpeil continued to oversee the restoration of the chateau and successfully liaised and lobbied with the supervising educational authorities to advance important projects concerning security, major improvements and maintenance.\n\n[[Yves Lemaire]] took over the helm in September 2001 until September 2012. The challenges were as stimulating as ever: the final stages of renovation and the future use of the chateau; the pressure for increasing the number of classes at Lyc\u00e9e level; nationwide administration of the OIB; the creation of the Polish section at Coll\u00e8ge and Lyc\u00e9e level (in 2002/3) and the consolidation of the legal status of the school via a new decree.\n\nHis successor, Joel Bianco officially took office as the new proviseur in September 2012. He directed the lyc\u00e9e from 2012 to 2016, integrating the Chinese Section. Isabelle Negral was proviseur from 2016 to 2019. She oversaw a major renovation, which included the creation of new secondary buildings, a new preschool building, and a state-of-the art gymnasium, as well as the renovation of the Agora, which will host the CDI, the Maison des Lyc\u00e9ens, meeting rooms, and a center for the arts. France Bessis became proviseur of the school in 2019. \n\n\n== Academics ==\nThe curriculum at the Lyc\u00e9e International combines the French national curriculum with the curriculum of one of the national sections. French Education National teachers teach subjects to French national standards and the school's foreign teachers \u2013 employed in one of the system\u2019s fourteen national sections \u2013 are given the freedom and responsibility to teach literature, language and history to their own national standards. These additional classes in the national sections provide (on a weekly basis):\n\n*Six hours of language class in the primary school\n*Six hours in the middles school, including four hours of literature/language and two hours of history\n*Eight hours in the upper school, usually divided into four hours of literature/language and four hours of history/geography**\n\n(**American Section students have five hours of literature/language and three hours of history/geography, as do Polish Section students. Japanese Section students have six hours of literature/language and two hours of history/geography. Chinese section students take math courses during section time instead of history.)\n\nSince the French curriculum requires learning at least two foreign language, many students who graduate from the Lyc\u00e9e International are fluent in four languages.\n\nStudents who do not speak French are placed in a French immersion program called ''Fran\u00e7ais Sp\u00e9cial''. After one year, they are expected to be fluent in French and integrate the standard French curriculum along with the rest of the student population.\n\nLyc\u00e9e International students must take the international variation on the ''baccalaur\u00e9at'', called the OIB ([[Baccalaur\u00e9at#Variations on the general baccalaur\u00e9at|Option Internationale du baccalaur\u00e9at]]), in order to take advantage of their language skills.\nBaccalaureat results at the Lyc\u00e9e International de Saint Germain-en-Laye fluctuate between 99% and 100%, and an honors (''mention'') rate which is above 90%. These figures are used to compile rankings by national news outlets.
