Standard techniques allow differentiation only within a certain range of brightness. Outside of this range, no features are visible because there is no differentiation in bright areas as everything appears just pure white, and there is no differentiation in darker areas as everything appears pure black.  \n\nHDR images can record and represent a greater range of luminance levels than can be achieved using more traditional methods, such as many real-world scenes containing very bright, direct sunlight to extreme shade, or very faint [[Nebula|nebulae]].

HDR images can also be acquired using special [[Image sensor|image sensors]], such as an [[oversampled binary image sensor]].\n\nDue to the limitations of printing and [[display contrast]], the extended luminosity range of input HDR images has to be compressed to be made visible. The method of rendering an HDR image to a standard monitor or printing device is called [[tone mapping]]. This method reduces the overall contrast of an HDR image to facilitate display on devices or printouts with lower dynamic range, and can be applied to produce images with preserved local contrast (or exaggerated for artistic effect).\n\n\"HDR\" may refer to the overall process, to the HDR imaging process, or to HDR imaging represented on a low dynamic range display such as a screen or standard .jpg image.\n\n\n== Emulating the human vision system==\nOne aim of HDR is to present a similar range of [[luminance]] to that experienced through the human [[visual system]]. The human eye, through non-linear response, [[adaptation (eye)|adaptation]] of the [[Iris (anatomy)|iris]] and other methods, adjusts constantly to adapt to a broad range of luminance present in the environment. The brain continuously interprets this information so that a viewer can see in a wide range of light conditions.\n\nStandard photographic and image techniques allow differentiation only within a certain range of brightness. Outside of this range, no features are visible because there is no differentiation in bright areas as everything appears just pure white, and there is no differentiation in darker areas as everything appears pure black.  Non-HDR cameras take photographs with a limited exposure range, referred to as low dynamic range (LDR), resulting in the loss of detail in highlights or [[shadow#Photography|shadows]].\n\n== Photography ==\n\n{|class=\"wikitable unsortable floatright\"\n|+ '''Dynamic ranges of common devices'''\n|-\n!

An increase of one EV, or 'one stop', represents a doubling of the amount of light. Conversely, a decrease of one EV represents a halving of the amount of light. Therefore, revealing detail in the darkest of shadows requires high exposures, while preserving detail in very bright situations requires very low exposures. Most cameras cannot provide this range of exposure values within a single exposure, due to their low dynamic range.\nHigh-dynamic-range photographs are generally achieved by capturing multiple standard-exposure images, often using [[Bracketing#Exposure bracketing|exposure bracketing]], and then later [[Exposure fusion|merging them]] into a single HDR image, usually within a [[photo manipulation]] program.\n\nAny camera that allows manual exposure control can make images for HDR work, although one equipped with [[Autobracketing|auto exposure bracketing (AEB)]] is far better suited. Images from film cameras are less suitable as they often must first be digitized, so that they can later be processed using software HDR methods.\n\nIn most imaging devices, the degree of exposure to light applied to the active element (be it film or [[Charge-coupled device|CCD]]) can be altered in one of two ways: by either increasing/decreasing the size of the [[aperture]] or by increasing/decreasing the time of each [[exposure (photography)|exposure]]. Exposure variation in an HDR set is only done by altering the '''exposure time''' and ''not'' the aperture size; this is because altering the aperture size also affects the [[depth of field]] and so the resultant multiple images would be quite different, preventing their final combination into a single HDR image.\n\nAn important limitation for HDR photography is that any movement between successive images will impede or prevent success in combining them afterward. Also, as one must create several images (often three or five and sometimes more) to obtain the desired [[luminance]] range, such a full 'set' of images takes extra time. HDR photographers have developed calculation methods and techniques to partially overcome these problems, but the use of a sturdy tripod is, at least, advised.\n\nSome cameras have an [[Autobracketing|auto exposure bracketing (AEB)]] feature with a far greater dynamic range than others, from the 3 EV of the [[Canon EOS 40D]], to the 18 EV of the [[Canon EOS-1D Mark II]].<ref>{{cite web |title=Auto Exposure Bracketing by camera model |url=http://hdr-photography.com/aeb.html |accessdate=18 August 2009}}</ref> As the popularity of this imaging method grows, several camera manufacturers are now offering built-in HDR features.

Although it is a distinct operation, tone mapping is often applied to HDRI files by the same software package.\n\nSeveral software applications are available on the PC, Mac and Linux platforms for producing HDR files and tone mapped images.

This is different from traditional [[digital images]], which represent colors as they should appear on a monitor or a paper print. Therefore, HDR image formats are often called ''scene-referred'', in contrast to traditional digital images, which are ''device-referred'' or ''output-referred''. Furthermore, traditional images are usually encoded for the human [[visual system]] (maximizing the visual information stored in the fixed number of bits), which is usually called ''gamma encoding'' or ''[[gamma correction]]''. The values stored for HDR images are often [[gamma correction|gamma compressed]] ([[power law]]) or [[logarithm]]ically encoded, or [[floating point|floating-point]] linear values, since [[fixed-point arithmetic|fixed-point]] linear encodings are increasingly inefficient over higher dynamic ranges.<ref name=gregward/><ref>{{cite web |url=http://radsite.lbl.gov/radiance/refer/Notes/picture_format.html |accessdate=2009-08-21 |title=The Radiance Picture File Format}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |last=Fernando |first=Randima |title=GPU Gems |publisher=Addison-Wesley |location=Boston |year=2004 |chapter=26.5 Linear Pixel Values |url=http://http.developer.nvidia.com/GPUGems/gpugems_ch26.html |isbn=0-321-22832-4 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100412001848/http://http.developer.nvidia.com/GPUGems/gpugems_ch26.html |archivedate=2010-04-12 }}</ref>\n\nHDR images often don't use fixed ranges per color [[channel (digital image)|channel]]\u2014other than traditional images\u2014to represent many more colors over a much wider dynamic range. For that purpose, they do not use integer values to represent the single color channels (e.g., 0-255 in an 8 bit per pixel interval for red, green and blue) but instead use a floating point representation. Common are 16-bit (''[[half precision]]'') or 32-bit [[floating point]] numbers to represent HDR pixels. However, when the appropriate [[transfer function]] is used, HDR pixels for some applications can be represented with a [[color depth]] that has as few as 10\u201312&nbsp;bits for luminance and 8&nbsp;bits for [[chrominance]] without introducing any visible quantization artifacts.<ref name=gregward>{{cite web |url=http://www.anyhere.com/gward/hdrenc/hdr_encodings.html |title=High Dynamic Range Image Encodings |author1=Greg Ward |author2=Anyhere Software }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.mpi-sb.mpg.de/resources/hdrvideo/ |title=Perception-motivated High Dynamic Range Video Encoding |author=[[Max Planck Institute for Computer Science]]}}</ref>\n\n== History of HDR photography ==\n\n=== Mid 19th century ===\n[[File:Gustave Le Gray - Brig upon the Water - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.2|An 1856 photo by [[Gustave Le Gray]]]]\nThe idea of using several exposures to adequately reproduce a too-extreme range of [[luminance]] was pioneered as early as the 1850s by [[Gustave Le Gray]] to render seascapes showing both the sky and the sea. Such rendering was impossible at the time using standard methods, as the luminosity range was too extreme. Le Gray used one negative for the sky, and another one with a longer exposure for the sea, and combined the two into one picture in positive.<ref name=GettyExh>[[J. Paul Getty Museum]].

This was effective because the dynamic range of the negative is significantly higher than would be available on the finished positive paper print when that is exposed via the negative in a uniform manner. An excellent example is the photograph ''Schweitzer at the Lamp'' by [[W. Eugene Smith]], from his 1954 [[photo essay]] ''A Man of Mercy'' on Dr. [[Albert Schweitzer]] and his humanitarian work in French Equatorial Africa. The image took 5 days to reproduce the tonal range of the scene, which ranges from a bright lamp (relative to the scene) to a dark shadow.<ref name=\"durand\"/>\n\n[[Ansel Adams]] elevated dodging and burning to an art form. Many of his famous prints were manipulated in the darkroom with these two methods. Adams wrote a comprehensive book on producing prints called ''The Print,'' which prominently features dodging and burning, in the context of his [[Zone System]].\n\nWith the advent of color photography, tone mapping in the darkroom was no longer possible due to the specific timing needed during the developing process of color film. Photographers looked to film manufacturers to design new film stocks with improved response, or continued to shoot in black and white to use tone mapping methods.{{citation needed|date=November 2013}}\n\n[[File:Wyckoff HDR Curve.tif|thumb|left|upright=2.4|Exposure/Density Characteristics of Wyckoff's Extended Exposure Response Film]]\nColor film capable of directly recording high-dynamic-range images was developed by [[Charles Wyckoff]] and [[EG&G]] \"in the course of a contract with the Department of the Air Force\".<ref>{{cite patent | inventor-last = Wyckoff | inventor-first = Charles W.\n | inventorlink = Charles Wyckoff | inventor2-last = EG&G Inc., assignee | inventor2-first = | inventorlink2 = EG&G | publication-date = March 24, 1961 | issue-date = June 17, 1969 | title = Silver Halide Photographic Film having Increased Exposure-response Characteristics | country-code = US | description = | patent-number = 3450536 | url = http://www.google.com/patents?hl=en&lr=&vid=USPAT3450536&id=43RzAAAAEBAJ&oi=fnd&dq=%22Extended+exposure%22+Wyckoff&printsec=abstract#v=onepage&q=%22Extended%20exposure%22%20Wyckoff&f=false | accessdate = June 1, 2012}}</ref> This XR film had three [[Photographic emulsion|emulsion]] layers, an upper layer having an [[Film speed#ASA|ASA]] speed rating of 400, a middle layer with an intermediate rating, and a lower layer with an ASA rating of 0.004.

HDR images can also be acquired using special [[Image sensor|image sensors]], such as an [[oversampled binary image sensor]].\n\nDue to the limitations of printing and [[display contrast]], the extended luminosity range of input HDR images has to be compressed to be made visible. The method of rendering an HDR image to a standard monitor or printing device is called [[tone mapping]]. This method reduces the overall contrast of an HDR image to facilitate display on devices or printouts with lower dynamic range, and can be applied to produce images with preserved local contrast (or exaggerated for artistic effect).\n\n\"HDR\" may refer to the overall process, to the HDR imaging process, or to HDR imaging represented on a low dynamic range display such as a screen or standard .jpg image.\n\n\n== Emulating the human vision system==\nOne aim of HDR is to present a similar range of [[luminance]] to that experienced through the human [[visual system]]. The human eye, through non-linear response, [[adaptation (eye)|adaptation]] of the [[Iris (anatomy)|iris]] and other methods, adjusts constantly to adapt to a broad range of luminance present in the environment. The brain continuously interprets this information so that a viewer can see in a wide range of light conditions.\n\nStandard photographic and image techniques allow differentiation only within a certain range of brightness. Outside of this range, no features are visible because there is no differentiation in bright areas as everything appears just pure white, and there is no differentiation in darker areas as everything appears pure black.  Non-HDR cameras take photographs with a limited exposure range, referred to as low dynamic range (LDR), resulting in the loss of detail in highlights or [[shadow#Photography|shadows]].\n\n== Photography ==\n\n{|class=\"wikitable unsortable floatright\"\n|+ '''Dynamic ranges of common devices'''\n|-\n!

An increase of one EV, or 'one stop', represents a doubling of the amount of light. Conversely, a decrease of one EV represents a halving of the amount of light. Therefore, revealing detail in the darkest of shadows requires high exposures, while preserving detail in very bright situations requires very low exposures. Most cameras cannot provide this range of exposure values within a single exposure, due to their low dynamic range.\nHigh-dynamic-range photographs are generally achieved by capturing multiple standard-exposure images, often using [[Bracketing#Exposure bracketing|exposure bracketing]], and then later [[Exposure fusion|merging them]] into a single HDR image, usually within a [[photo manipulation]] program.\n\nAny camera that allows manual exposure control can make images for HDR work, although one equipped with [[Autobracketing|auto exposure bracketing (AEB)]] is far better suited. Images from film cameras are less suitable as they often must first be digitized, so that they can later be processed using software HDR methods.\n\nIn most imaging devices, the degree of exposure to light applied to the active element (be it film or [[Charge-coupled device|CCD]]) can be altered in one of two ways: by either increasing/decreasing the size of the [[aperture]] or by increasing/decreasing the time of each [[exposure (photography)|exposure]]. Exposure variation in an HDR set is only done by altering the '''exposure time''' and ''not'' the aperture size; this is because altering the aperture size also affects the [[depth of field]] and so the resultant multiple images would be quite different, preventing their final combination into a single HDR image.\n\nAn important limitation for HDR photography is that any movement between successive images will impede or prevent success in combining them afterward. Also, as one must create several images (often three or five and sometimes more) to obtain the desired [[luminance]] range, such a full 'set' of images takes extra time. HDR photographers have developed calculation methods and techniques to partially overcome these problems, but the use of a sturdy tripod is, at least, advised.\n\nSome cameras have an [[Autobracketing|auto exposure bracketing (AEB)]] feature with a far greater dynamic range than others, from the 3 EV of the [[Canon EOS 40D]], to the 18 EV of the [[Canon EOS-1D Mark II]].<ref>{{cite web |title=Auto Exposure Bracketing by camera model |url=http://hdr-photography.com/aeb.html |accessdate=18 August 2009}}</ref> As the popularity of this imaging method grows, several camera manufacturers are now offering built-in HDR features.

Although it is a distinct operation, tone mapping is often applied to HDRI files by the same software package.\n\nSeveral software applications are available on the PC, Mac and Linux platforms for producing HDR files and tone mapped images.

This is different from traditional [[digital images]], which represent colors as they should appear on a monitor or a paper print. Therefore, HDR image formats are often called ''scene-referred'', in contrast to traditional digital images, which are ''device-referred'' or ''output-referred''. Furthermore, traditional images are usually encoded for the human [[visual system]] (maximizing the visual information stored in the fixed number of bits), which is usually called ''gamma encoding'' or ''[[gamma correction]]''. The values stored for HDR images are often [[gamma correction|gamma compressed]] ([[power law]]) or [[logarithm]]ically encoded, or [[floating point|floating-point]] linear values, since [[fixed-point arithmetic|fixed-point]] linear encodings are increasingly inefficient over higher dynamic ranges.<ref name=gregward/><ref>{{cite web |url=http://radsite.lbl.gov/radiance/refer/Notes/picture_format.html |accessdate=2009-08-21 |title=The Radiance Picture File Format}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |last=Fernando |first=Randima |title=GPU Gems |publisher=Addison-Wesley |location=Boston |year=2004 |chapter=26.5 Linear Pixel Values |url=http://http.developer.nvidia.com/GPUGems/gpugems_ch26.html |isbn=0-321-22832-4 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100412001848/http://http.developer.nvidia.com/GPUGems/gpugems_ch26.html |archivedate=2010-04-12 }}</ref>\n\nHDR images often don't use fixed ranges per color [[channel (digital image)|channel]]\u2014other than traditional images\u2014to represent many more colors over a much wider dynamic range. For that purpose, they do not use integer values to represent the single color channels (e.g., 0-255 in an 8 bit per pixel interval for red, green and blue) but instead use a floating point representation. Common are 16-bit (''[[half precision]]'') or 32-bit [[floating point]] numbers to represent HDR pixels. However, when the appropriate [[transfer function]] is used, HDR pixels for some applications can be represented with a [[color depth]] that has as few as 10\u201312&nbsp;bits for luminance and 8&nbsp;bits for [[chrominance]] without introducing any visible quantization artifacts.<ref name=gregward>{{cite web |url=http://www.anyhere.com/gward/hdrenc/hdr_encodings.html |title=High Dynamic Range Image Encodings |author1=Greg Ward |author2=Anyhere Software }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.mpi-sb.mpg.de/resources/hdrvideo/ |title=Perception-motivated High Dynamic Range Video Encoding |author=[[Max Planck Institute for Computer Science]]}}</ref>\n\n== History of HDR photography ==\n\n=== Mid 19th century ===\n[[File:Gustave Le Gray - Brig upon the Water - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.2|An 1856 photo by [[Gustave Le Gray]]]]\nThe idea of using several exposures to adequately reproduce a too-extreme range of [[luminance]] was pioneered as early as the 1850s by [[Gustave Le Gray]] to render seascapes showing both the sky and the sea. Such rendering was impossible at the time using standard methods, as the luminosity range was too extreme. Le Gray used one negative for the sky, and another one with a longer exposure for the sea, and combined the two into one picture in positive.<ref name=GettyExh>[[J. Paul Getty Museum]].

This was effective because the dynamic range of the negative is significantly higher than would be available on the finished positive paper print when that is exposed via the negative in a uniform manner. An excellent example is the photograph ''Schweitzer at the Lamp'' by [[W. Eugene Smith]], from his 1954 [[photo essay]] ''A Man of Mercy'' on Dr. [[Albert Schweitzer]] and his humanitarian work in French Equatorial Africa. The image took 5 days to reproduce the tonal range of the scene, which ranges from a bright lamp (relative to the scene) to a dark shadow.<ref name=\"durand\"/>\n\n[[Ansel Adams]] elevated dodging and burning to an art form. Many of his famous prints were manipulated in the darkroom with these two methods. Adams wrote a comprehensive book on producing prints called ''The Print,'' which prominently features dodging and burning, in the context of his [[Zone System]].\n\nWith the advent of color photography, tone mapping in the darkroom was no longer possible due to the specific timing needed during the developing process of color film. Photographers looked to film manufacturers to design new film stocks with improved response, or continued to shoot in black and white to use tone mapping methods.{{citation needed|date=November 2013}}\n\n[[File:Wyckoff HDR Curve.tif|thumb|left|upright=2.4|Exposure/Density Characteristics of Wyckoff's Extended Exposure Response Film]]\nColor film capable of directly recording high-dynamic-range images was developed by [[Charles Wyckoff]] and [[EG&G]] \"in the course of a contract with the Department of the Air Force\".<ref>{{cite patent | inventor-last = Wyckoff | inventor-first = Charles W.\n | inventorlink = Charles Wyckoff | inventor2-last = EG&G Inc., assignee | inventor2-first = | inventorlink2 = EG&G | publication-date = March 24, 1961 | issue-date = June 17, 1969 | title = Silver Halide Photographic Film having Increased Exposure-response Characteristics | country-code = US | description = | patent-number = 3450536 | url = http://www.google.com/patents?hl=en&lr=&vid=USPAT3450536&id=43RzAAAAEBAJ&oi=fnd&dq=%22Extended+exposure%22+Wyckoff&printsec=abstract#v=onepage&q=%22Extended%20exposure%22%20Wyckoff&f=false | accessdate = June 1, 2012}}</ref> This XR film had three [[Photographic emulsion|emulsion]] layers, an upper layer having an [[Film speed#ASA|ASA]] speed rating of 400, a middle layer with an intermediate rating, and a lower layer with an ASA rating of 0.004.

The image array generated by the first step of Mann's process is called a ''lightspace image'', ''lightspace picture'', or ''radiance map''.

The monks of Arbroath Abbey selected Alexander Ogilvy of Inverquharity as his replacement and the insult led to pitched battle in the town, leaving 500 dead, including Lindsay and Ogilvy. Large parts of the town were destroyed in the aftermath by the Lindsay family.<ref name=\"lindsays\">Jervise, A.

After the original harbours, dating from the 14th and 18th centuries, were replaced in 1839 with a larger harbour, the local council tried to find fishermen who would be interested in migrating to Arbroath in order to take advantage of the new facilities offered. The town council contacted fishermen in nearby [[Auchmithie]] and further afield, including [[Shetland]]. The fishing industry grew and at its peak years between 1900 and 1980, around 40 [[Freshwater whitefish|whitefish]] and [[pelagic]] vessels worked from Arbroath, with hundreds of men employed directly as [[fishermen]], hundreds more employed ashore to service the fishing vessels and to process the fish. Quota cuts and decommissioning took its toll on the fishing industry throughout Scotland from the 1980s to present. Today, Arbroath remains a designated whitefish landing port, and although no fish auction takes place, the fishmarket remains open and is used for landing shellfish.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thecourier.co.uk/output/2004/03/04/newsstory5681647t0.asp |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040606160402/http://www.thecourier.co.uk/output/2004/03/04/newsstory5681647t0.asp |url-status = dead|archive-date=6 June 2004 |title=Second boost as Arbroath harbour back on the map |accessdate=30 January 2007 |date=4 March 2004 |work=The Courier and Advertiser |publisher=D.C Thompson |df= }}</ref> There is now only one large fishing vessel operating regularly from Arbroath, and a further three Arbroath owned vessels operating from [[Aberdeen]] and ports further north.

After around an hour of smoking, the fish are golden brown and ready to eat.<ref name='defra1'>\n{{cite web\n |url=http://www.defra.gov.uk/foodrin/foodname/pfn/products/registered/arbsm.htm \n |title=Arbroath Smokie PGI \n |accessdate=8 February 2009 \n |date=31 March 2004 \n |work=Protected Food Names \n |publisher=HM Government \n |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081225130959/http://www.defra.gov.uk/foodrin/foodname/pfn/products/registered/arbsm.htm \n |archivedate=25 December 2008 \n |url-status = dead\n |df=dmy \n}} \n</ref> The preparation of smokies remains a [[cottage industry]] in Arbroath, centred almost exclusively at the harbour area.

After the original harbours, dating from the 14th and 18th centuries, were replaced in 1839 with a larger harbour, the local council tried to find fishermen who would be interested in migrating to Arbroath in order to take advantage of the new facilities offered. The town council contacted fishermen in nearby [[Auchmithie]] and further afield, including [[Shetland]]. The fishing industry grew and at its peak years between 1900 and 1980, around 40 [[Freshwater whitefish|whitefish]] and [[pelagic]] vessels worked from Arbroath, with hundreds of men employed directly as [[fishermen]], hundreds more employed ashore to service the fishing vessels and to process the fish. Quota cuts and decommissioning took its toll on the fishing industry throughout Scotland from the 1980s to present.

His father, a truck driver, abandoned his family in Gray's youth. Upon the death of his mother, Mfume dropped out of high school at sixteen to begin working as many as three jobs at a time to support his three sisters. He also began hanging around street corners, sometimes with the wrong friends. In his biography, he reports that he \"was locked up a couple of times on suspicion of theft because [he] happened to be black and happened to be young.\" Speculation as to the degree of his entanglement with the law has varied, especially as he later came into prominence.

Often working 40 to 46 hours per week at various Baltimore city Teen Centers (an after school program) while simultaneously a full-time student at [[Baltimore City Community College]], where he served as the head of its [[Black Students Union]] and the editor of the school newspaper. He went on to attend [[Morgan State University]], where he graduated ''[[magna cum laude]]'' in 1976. He would go on to earn a [[Master of Liberal Arts]] degree in 1984 at [[Johns Hopkins University]].

His father, a truck driver, abandoned his family in Gray's youth. Upon the death of his mother, Mfume dropped out of high school at sixteen to begin working as many as three jobs at a time to support his three sisters. He also began hanging around street corners, sometimes with the wrong friends. In his biography, he reports that he \"was locked up a couple of times on suspicion of theft because [he] happened to be black and happened to be young.\" Speculation as to the degree of his entanglement with the law has varied, especially as he later came into prominence.

He went on to attend [[Morgan State University]], where he graduated ''[[magna cum laude]]'' in 1976. He would go on to earn a Master of Liberal Arts degree in 1984 at [[Johns Hopkins University]].

Shiva is worshiped as Aiyarappar, and is represented by the ''[[lingam]]'' and his consort [[Parvati]] is depicted as Dharmasamvardhini. The presiding deity is revered in the 7th century Tamil Saiva canonical work, the ''[[Tevaram]]'', written by Tamil poet saints known as the [[nayanars]] and classified as ''[[Paadal Petra Sthalam]]''.\n\nThere are many inscriptions associated with the temple indicating contributions from [[Cholas]], [[Thanjavur Nayaks]] and [[Thanjavur Maratha kingdom]]. The oldest parts of the present masonry structure were built during the [[Chola dynasty]] in the 9th century, while later expansions, including the towering [[gopuram]] gatehouses, are attributed to later periods, up to the Thanjavur Nayaks during the 16th century.\n\nThe temple complex is one of the largest in the state and it houses four gateway towers known as ''[[gopurams]]''. The temple has numerous shrines, with those of Aiyarappar and Dharmasamvardhini being the most prominent. The temple complex houses many halls and three precincts; the most notable is the second precinct built during the [[Vijayanagara Empire|Vijayanagar period]] that has many sculptures. The temple has six daily rituals at various times from [[5:30]] a.m. to 10 p.m., and twelve yearly festivals on its calendar. The temple is maintained and administered by [[Hindu Religious and Charitable Endowments Department]] of the [[Government of Tamil Nadu]].\n\n==Legend==\n[[File:Aiyarappar temple (42).jpg|250px|left|thumb|Image of temple tank]]\nThe presiding deity is named Aiyarappar or Panchanadeeswarar as the place has five rivers. In [[Tamil language|Tamil]], ''ai'' means five, ''aru'' means river signifying the name. As per Hindu legend, once a devout devotee of Shiva who was also the priest in the temple could not return to the temple on time as he was out to [[Varanasi|Kashi]] on a pilgrimage. On account of the delay, the priest prayed to Shiva for his inability to perform the days worship practices. When he returned the next day to the temple, people were astonished as they realized that Shiva descended in the form of the priest the previous day. It is place where Appar, the famous Saivite saint is believed to have obtained the vision of [[Kailasa]]. [[Sundarar]] came to Thirukkandiyur in the opposite bank of river [[Cauvery]] to worship at [[Kandeeswarar Temple, Kandiyur|Kandeeswarar Temple]]. He could not cross the river on account of floods and he prayed to Shiva. It is believed that on account of his worship, the river paved the way onto the temple.\n\nAs per another legend, Nandekasar, the founder of Tirukailaya monastic dynasty, was born at this place to sage Salandha. The sage left the child in the temple. It is believed that Shiva performed ablution with Ambika's breast milk on the child, foam from Nandhi's mouth, nectar from Surya Pushakarni, Amrita pushkarani and Saiva theertham (the three water bodies). Since the child received from five different water sources, the presiding deity came to be known as Aiyarappar.<ref name=\"dinamalar\"/><ref name=Thevaram/>\n\n==Location==\n[[File:\u0ba4\u0bbf\u0bb0\u0bc1\u0bb5\u0bc8\u0baf\u0bbe\u0bb1\u0bc1 \u0b9a\u0bbf\u0bb5\u0ba9\u0bcd \u0b95\u0bcb\u0baf\u0bbf\u0bb2\u0bcd.JPG|200x200px|thumb|Gopuram view]]\nThe temple is located in [[Tiruvaiyaru]] ([[Tamil language|Tamil]]: \u0ba4\u0bbf\u0bb0\u0bc1\u0bb5\u0bc8\u0baf\u0bbe\u0bb1\u0bc1), a [[panchayat town]] in [[Thanjavur district]] in the [[India]]n [[States and territories of India|state]] of [[Tamil Nadu]].
