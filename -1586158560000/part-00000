Fulp later merged his two websites to form another website with the name ''Newgrounds'', leading to him to change hosts to accommodate the increasing traffic, and started selling merchandise to pay for the website's hosting bills. Introducing banner ads to pay for growing payments in 1999, Fulp partnered with [[Troma Entertainment|Troma]], who hosted the site in exchange for a share of ad revenue. A chat room and message board was added onto the website, which allowed people visiting the website to interact with each other. Many users had begun submitting their own Flash creations to Fulp, so he created a portion of the site called \"The Portal\" to display them. A friend of Fulp's named Ross developed the \"Grounds Gold System\", which allowed users to gain points for voting on submissions online. Ad revenue had increased, so Ross was hired, starting development of the current automated Portal, which would allow users to submit their own generated content to the website and have it judged by anyone visiting.\n\n===2000s: Developments===\nAfter the [[dot-com bubble]] collapsed, Newgrounds struggled in paying its hosting costs.

In 2012, Newgrounds published their first mobile game, titled ''GroundCats'', on [[iOS]]. That same year, major changes to the website included the launch of the video player, allowing users to publish movies that were not in .SWF format for the first time, and support for HTML5-coded games, which meant users were no longer limited to submitting movies and games made in Flash. In 2013, the site suffered heavily through financial issues and closed down its online merchandise market the year after. Platform mobile game ''[[Geometry Dash]]'' developed by RobTop Games allowed songs from Newgrounds to be used in levels made with the level editor with the release of its 1.9 update in 2014. The Audio Portal consisted of submitted copyrighted songs for use in the game, leading to [[nightcore]], along with [[Mashup (music)|mashups]], banned as a result.\n\nThe issue of copyright protection came to a head in 2016, when the site received a serious challenge to deal with the content and files containing unlicensed commercial music and images, resulting in many submissions being removed by moderators and staff.

Similar organizations exist in other countries as well, including the ''[[Studentenverbindungen]]'' of German-speaking countries or the [[Goliardia]] in Italy.\n\nSimilar, but much less common, organizations also exist for secondary school students, as do [[fraternal order]]s for other adults. In modern usage, \"Greek letter organization\" is often synonymous with the terms \"fraternity\" and \"sorority\". Two additional types of fraternities, professional fraternities and honor societies, incorporate some limited elements of traditional fraternity organization, but are generally considered a different type of association. Traditional fraternities of the type described in this article are often called \"social fraternities\".\n\nGenerally, membership in a fraternity or sorority is obtained as an [[Undergraduate education|undergraduate]] [[Higher education|student]] but continues, thereafter, for life.

The founding of Phi Beta Kappa followed the earlier establishment of two other secret student societies that had existed at that campus as early as 1750. In 1779 Phi Beta Kappa expanded to include chapters at Harvard and Yale.  By the early 19th century, the organization transformed itself into a scholastic honor society and abandoned secrecy.\n\nIn 1825, [[Kappa Alpha Society]], the oldest extant fraternity to retain its social characteristic, was established at [[Union College]]. In 1827, [[Sigma Phi]] and [[Delta Phi]] were also founded at the same institution,<ref name=handbook>{{cite book|last1=Whalen|first1=Richard|title=Handbook of Secret Organizations|date=1967|publisher=Bruce Publishing Company|location=Milwaukee|pages=43\u201345}}</ref> creating the [[Union Triad]]. The further birthing of [[Psi Upsilon]] (1833), [[Chi Psi]] (1841) and [[Theta Delta Chi]] (1847) collectively established Union College as the [[Mother of Fraternities]].\nThe social fraternity [[Chi Phi]], although officially formed in 1854, traces its roots to 1824,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://chiphi.dynamic.omegafi.com/about-chi-phi/|title=History of Chi Phi|author=|date=|website=www.chiphi.org|accessdate=14 March 2019}}</ref> and oldest.org considers it the oldest social fraternity.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.oldest.org/culture/fraternities-north-america/|title=7 Oldest Fraternities in North America|author=|date=|website=www.oldest.org|accessdate=14 March 2019}}</ref>\n\nFraternities represented the intersection between [[dining club]]s, [[College literary societies|literary societies]] and secret initiatory orders such as [[Freemasonry]]. Their early growth was widely opposed by university administrators, though the increasing influence of fraternity alumni, as well as several high-profile court cases, succeeded in largely muting opposition by the 1880s.<ref name=\"handbook\"/> The first fraternity meeting hall, or lodge, seems to have been that of the Alpha Epsilon chapter of Chi Psi at the [[University of Michigan]] in 1845, leading to a tradition in that fraternity to name its buildings \"lodges\". As fraternity membership was punishable by expulsion at many colleges at this time, the house was located deep in the woods.<ref>{{Citation\n| last = Birdseye\n| first = Clarence Frank\n| title = Individual Training in Our Colleges\n| place = New York\n| publisher = The MacMillan Company\n| year = 1907\n| page = 211\n| url = https://books.google.com/?id=Bv7ZFGz9MCYC\n| accessdate = 2008-06-20}}</ref> The first residential chapter home, built by a fraternity, is believed to have been [[Alpha Delta Phi|Alpha Delta Phi's]] chapter at [[Cornell University|Cornell]], with groundbreaking dated to 1878.<ref>[http://www.alphadeltaphi.org/AboutUs/Chapters/tabid/59/agentType/View/ChapterID/12/Default.aspx Chapter History] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160826152136/http://www.alphadeltaphi.org/AboutUs/Chapters/tabid/59/agentType/View/ChapterID/12/Default.aspx |date=2016-08-26 }}, accessed 16 October 2015.

The Adelphean, founded in 1851 eventually became [[Alpha Delta Pi]], while The Philomathean, begun in 1852, eventually became [[Phi Mu]]. Together, these sororities are known as the \"Macon Magnolias\". Several other unrelated \"Philomathean Societies\" emerged during the 19th Century, most notably a literary society at UPenn and another, unrelated, at NYU.</ref> though fraternity-like organizations for women didn't take their current form until the establishment of [[Pi Beta Phi]] in 1867 and [[Kappa Alpha Theta]] in 1870. The term \"sorority\" was invented by a professor of Latin who felt the word \"fraternity\" was inappropriate for a group of ladies. The first organization to use the term \"sorority\" was [[Gamma Phi Beta]], established in 1874.<ref name=\"bairdtwo\"/>\n\nThe development of \"fraternities for women\" during this time was a major accomplishment in the way of women's rights and equality. By mere existence, these organizations were defying the odds; the founding women were able to advance their organizations despite many factors working against them. The first \"Women's Fraternities\" not only had to overcome \"restrictive social customs, unequal status under the law and the underlying presumption that they were less able than men,\"<ref>{{Cite web|url = https://www.npcwomen.org/resources/pdf/Adventures%20in%20Friendship.pdf|title = Adventure in Friendship: A History of The National Panhellenic Conference|date = |accessdate = October 12, 2015|website = National Panhellenic Conference|publisher = National Panhellenic Conference|last = |first = |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20130628024619/https://www.npcwomen.org/resources/pdf/Adventures%20in%20Friendship.pdf|archive-date = June 28, 2013|url-status = dead}}</ref> but at the same time had to deal with the same challenges as fraternities with college administrations. Today, both social and multicultural sororities are present on more than 650 college campuses across the United States and Canada. The [[National Panhellenic Conference]] (NPC) serves as the \"umbrella organization\" for 26 (inter)national sororities. Founded in 1902, the NPC is one of the oldest and largest women's membership organizations, representing more than 4 million women at 655 college/university campuses and 4,500 local alumnae chapters in the U.S. and Canada.<ref name=\"about npc\">{{cite web|url=http://www.npcwomen.org/about.aspx|title=National Panhellenic Conference|publisher=National Panhellenic Conference|accessdate=2010-01-01|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090126110021/http://npcwomen.org/about.aspx|archive-date=2009-01-26|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n===Internationalization===\nIn 1867, the [[Chi Phi]] fraternity established its Theta chapter at the [[University of Edinburgh]] in [[Scotland]], marking the first foray of the American social fraternity outside the borders of the United States. At the time, many students from the [[American south]] were moving to Europe to study because of the disrepair southern universities fell into during the [[American Civil War]]. One such group of Americans organized Chi Phi at Edinburgh; however, during the Theta chapter's existence, it initiated no non-American members. With declining American enrollment at European universities, Chi Phi at Edinburgh closed in 1870.<ref name=bairdtwo>{{cite book |last=Anson |first=Jack |date=1991 |title=Baird's Manual of American College Fraternities (20th Edition) |url= |location= |publisher=Bairds Manual Foundation |page=III-32 |isbn=978-0963715906 |accessdate= }}</ref>\n\n[[File:SigEpFlagIraq.jpg|thumb|right|U.S. Air Force, Airmen, presumably members of [[Sigma Phi Epsilon]], display that fraternity's flag in Iraq in 2009.]]\nNine years following Chi Phi's abortive colonization of the University of Edinburgh, a second attempt was made to transplant the fraternity system outside the United States. In 1879, [[Zeta Psi]] established a chapter at the [[University of Toronto]]. Zeta Psi's success at Toronto prompted it to open a second Canadian chapter at [[McGill University]], which it chartered in 1883. Other early foundations were [[Kappa Alpha Society]] at Toronto in 1892 and at McGill in 1899, and [[Alpha Delta Phi]] at Toronto in 1893 and at McGill in 1897. The first sorority, [[Kappa Alpha Theta]], was established at Toronto in 1887. By 1927 there were 42 fraternity and sorority chapters at the University of Toronto and of 23 at McGill University. A few chapters were also reported at the [[University of British Columbia]], [[Carleton University]], [[Dalhousie University]], [[University of Manitoba]], [[Queen's University at Kingston|Queen's University]], [[University of Western Ontario]], [[Wilfrid Laurier University]], [[University of Waterloo]] and [[Brock University]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://faculty.marianopolis.edu/c.belanger/quebechistory/encyclopedia/FraternitiesinCanada.htm |title=Fraternities in Canada |accessdate=2010-08-19 |encyclopedia=The Encyclopedia of Canada, Vol. II |publisher=University Associates of Canada |year=1948}}</ref>\n\nThe arrival of the fraternity system in Asia accompanied the introduction of the American educational system in the Philippines. The first fraternities were established in the [[University of the Philippines]]. The now defunct Patriotic and Progressive Rizal Center Academic Brotherhood (Rizal Center Fraternity), a brotherhood of Jose Rizal followers, was founded in 1913.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://xiaochua.net/2013/06/19/xiao-time-18-june-2013-ika-105-na-anibersaryo-ng-unibersidad-ng-pilipinas/ |title=XIAO TIME, 18 June 2013: Ika-105 na Anibersaryo ng Unibersidad ng Pilipinas | accessdate=2018-08-09|date=2013-06-19 }}</ref> This was followed by the Rizal Center Sorority.

While these limitations have since been abolished by both the [[Interfraternity Conference]] and the [[National Pan-Hellenic Council]], students of various ethnicities have come together to form a council of multicultural Greek organizations. The Multicultural Greek Council, officially formed in 1998, is a coordinating body of 19 Greek organizations, including nine fraternities, and ten sororities with cultural affiliations.<ref>{{cite web|title=History of MGC|url=http://mgc.tamu.edu/history|website=Multicultural Greek Council|publisher=Multicultural Greek Council|accessdate=12 October 2015}}</ref>\n\nThe first multicultural sorority, Mu Sigma Upsilon, was established in November 1981 at [[Rutgers University]].<ref name=\"nationalmgc.org\">{{cite web|title=EMERGENCE OF MULTICULTURAL FRATERNAL ORGANIZATIONS|url=http://nationalmgc.org/about/|website=National Multicultural Greek Council|publisher=National Multicultural Greek Council|accessdate=12 October 2015}}</ref>  The formation of this Greek organization allowed for the emergence of a multicultural fraternity and sorority movement, giving birth to a multicultural movement.\n\n==Structure and organization==\n===Common elements===\n====Gender exclusivity====\nFraternities and sororities traditionally have been single-sex organizations, with fraternities consisting exclusively of men and sororities consisting exclusively of women. In the United States, fraternities and sororities have a statutory exemption from [[Title IX]] legislation prohibiting this type of gender exclusion within student groups, and organizations such as the [[Fraternity and Sorority Political Action Committee]] lobby to maintain it.<ref name=\"bi1\">{{cite news|title=Why One School Decided To Make All Of Its Fraternities And Sororities Co-Ed |url=http://www.businessinsider.com/trinity-college-fraternities-sororities-co-ed-2014-10|work=[[Business Insider]]|date=9 October 2014}}</ref><ref name=\"bl\">{{cite news|title=Fraternities Lobby Against Campus Rape Investigations|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-03-24/fraternities-lobby-against-campus-rape-investigations|work=[[Bloomberg News|Bloomberg]]|date=24 March 2015}}</ref>\n\nSince the mid-20th century a small number of fraternities, such as [[Alpha Theta]] and [[Lambda Lambda Lambda]], have opted to become co-educational and admit female members; however, these generally represent a minority of Greek-letter organizations and no such fraternity is currently a member of the North American Interfraternity Conference, the largest international association of fraternities.<ref name=\"bi1\" /><ref name=\"bl\" />  The first coed fraternity was Pi Alpha Tau (1963\u20131991) at the [[University of Illinois at Chicago]].<ref>{{Cite web|title = Pi Alpha Tau Papers, 1963\u20131991, UIC Archives|url = http://findingaids.library.uic.edu/ead/lhsc/059-07-16.pdf|website = uic.edu|accessdate = 6 April 2012}}</ref>\n\nMuch more commonly, coed fraternities exist in the form of \"service\" fraternities such as [[Alpha Phi Omega]], [[Epsilon Sigma Alpha]], Alpha Tau Mu [[Service fraternities and sororities|and others]].

But in a [[bellwether]] case, in 2016 Harvard University changed its student conduct code to bar members of single-sex groups from leading campus groups, serving as captains of sports teams or participating in valuable academic fellowships. This clear and unprecedented attempt to eliminate the gender exclusivity that is typically associated with the fraternity and sorority culture is being contested vigorously in U.S. Federal Court by several affected fraternities and sororities, with the support of the broader Greek Life community.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.economist.com/united-states/2019/01/17/harvards-policy-against-single-sex-clubs-was-meant-to-protect-women|title=Harvard's policy against single-sex clubs was meant to protect women|date=2019-01-17|work=The Economist|access-date=2019-01-28|issn=0013-0613}}</ref><ref>[https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/harvard-sued-fraternities-sororities-over-single-sex-rule-n942961 Harvard sued by fraternities and sororities], in an NBC news report dated 3 Dec 2018, accessed 2 Aug 2019.</ref>\n\n====Governance====\nIndividual chapters of fraternities and sororities are largely self-governed by their active (student) members; however, alumni members may retain legal ownership of the fraternity or sorority's property through an alumni chapter or alumni corporation. All of a single fraternity or sorority's chapters are generally grouped together in a national or international organization that sets standards, regulates insignia and ritual, publishes a journal or magazine for all of the chapters of the organization, and has the power to grant and revoke charters to chapters. These federal structures are largely governed by alumni members of the fraternity, though with some input from the active (student) members.<ref>{{cite web|title=GOVERNANCE OF UNDERGRADUATE SOCIAL FRATERNITIES AND SORORITIES|url=http://provost.upenn.edu/policies/pennbook/2013/02/15/recognition-and-governance-of-undergraduate-social-fraternities-and-sororities|website=upenn.edu|publisher=[[University of Pennsylvania]]|accessdate=4 September 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170727030604/http://provost.upenn.edu/policies/pennbook/2013/02/15/recognition-and-governance-of-undergraduate-social-fraternities-and-sororities|archive-date=27 July 2017|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=ERM, ORSA and Corporate Governance: The Small Company Challenges|url=http://www.firstconsulting.com/erm-orsa-and-corporate-governance-small-company-challenges|website=firstconsulting.com|publisher=First Consulting}}</ref>\n\n====Rushing and pledging (recruitment and new member periods)====\n{{See also|Sorority recruitment}}\n\nMost Greek letter organizations select potential members through a two-part process of vetting and probation, called rushing and pledging, respectively. During rush (recruitment), students attend designated social events, and sometimes formal interviews, hosted by the chapters of fraternities and sororities in which they have particular interest. Usually, after a potential new member has attended several such events, officers or current members meet privately to vote on whether or not to extend an invitation (known as a \"bid\") to the prospective applicant. Those applicants who receive a bid, and choose to accept it, are considered to have \"pledged\" the fraternity or sorority, thus beginning the pledge period (new member period). Students participating in rush are known as \"rushees\" (Potential New Members \"PNMs\") while students who have accepted a bid to a specific fraternity or sorority are known as \"new members\" or in some cases \"pledges\".<ref name=tfa>{{cite web|title=Rush and Pledging Problems|url=http://thefraternityadvisor.com/rush-and-pledging-problems/|website=The Fraternity Advisor|accessdate=2 September 2015}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Delta Upsilon Ode2.ogg|thumb|\"Delta Upsilon Ode,\" a traditional [[Delta Upsilon]] song written in 1884 by Edward La Wall Seip (sample)]]\n[[File:\"My Name is Sigma Chi, Sir\".ogg|thumb|\"My Name is Sigma Chi, Sir,\" a traditional Sigma Chi song written in 1885 by Charles Eldridge (sample)]]\nA new member period may last anywhere from one weekend to several months. During this time, new members might participate in almost all aspects of the life of the fraternity or sorority, but most likely not be permitted to hold office in the organization. At the conclusion of the new member period, a second vote of members may sometimes be taken, often, but not always, using a [[blackballing|blackball]] system. New members who pass this second vote are invited to a formal and secret ritual of initiation into the organization, advancing them to full membership.<ref name=handbook/>\n\n[[File:Adphicornell.jpg|thumb|left|The chapter house of [[Alpha Delta Phi]] at [[Cornell University]]]]\nMany Greek-letter organizations give preferential consideration for pledging to candidates whose parent or sibling was a member of the same fraternity or sorority. Such prospective candidates are known as \"legacies\".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.gmu.edu/org/ifc/faq_glossary.htm |title=Glossary of Greek Life Terms |last1= |first1= |last2= |first2= |date= |website=gmu.edu |publisher=George Mason University Interfraternity Council |accessdate=28 December 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150325043212/http://www.gmu.edu/org/ifc/faq_glossary.htm |archive-date=25 March 2015 |url-status=dead }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://thefraternityadvisor.com/fraternity-legacy/ |title=Fraternity Legacies |last1= |first1= |last2= |first2= |date= |website=thefraternityadvisor.com |publisher=The Fraternity Advisor |accessdate=28 December 2014}}</ref>\n\nMembership in more than one fraternity or sorority is almost always prohibited. Recently, some Greek-letter organizations have replaced the term \"pledge\" with that of \"associate member\" or \"new member\".  [[Sigma Alpha Epsilon]], in 2014, abolished pledging altogether. Potential members are now immediately initiated into the fraternity upon accepting a bid.<ref name=tfa/><ref>{{cite news|title=Deadliest U.S. Fraternity Abolishes Pledging for New Members|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2014-03-07/most-deadly-u-s-fraternity-scraps-initiation-for-new-members|work=[[Bloomberg News|Bloomberg]]|issue=7 March 2014}}</ref>\n\n====Residency====\nUnique among most campus organizations, members of social Greek letter organizations often live together in a large house (generally privately owned by the fraternity itself, or by the fraternity's alumni association) or a distinct part of the university dormitories. A single undergraduate fraternity chapter may be composed of anywhere between 20 and more than 100 students, though most have between 35 and 45 members and pledges. Often fraternities and sorority houses (called lodges or chapter houses) are located on the same street or in close quarters within the same neighborhood, which may be colloquially known as \"Greek row\" or \"frat row\". At some, often small, colleges, fraternities and sororities occupy a specific section of university-owned housing provided to them. Some fraternities and sororities are un-housed, with members providing for their own accommodations. In many of these cases, the fraternity or sorority own or rent a non-residential clubhouse to use for meetings and other activities. \n\n[[File:Zeta Psi Fraternity House, Lafayette College 01.JPG|left|thumb|The [[Zeta Psi]] chapter house at [[Lafayette College]]]]\n\n====Secrecy and ritual====\nWith a few exceptions, most fraternities and sororities are secret societies. While the identity of members or officers is rarely concealed, fraternities and sororities initiate members following the pledge period through sometimes elaborate private rituals, frequently drawn or adopted from Masonic ritual practice or that of the Greek mysteries.<ref name=handbook/>\n\nAt the conclusion of an initiation ritual, the organization's secret motto, secret purpose and secret identification signs, such as handshakes and passwords, are usually revealed to its new members.

Most fraternities also have assumed heraldic achievements. Members of fraternities and sororities address members of the same organization as \"brother\" (in the case of fraternities) or \"sister\" (in the case of sororities). The names of almost all fraternities and sororities consist of a sequence of two or three Greek letters, for instance, [[Delta Delta Delta]], [[Sigma Chi]], [[Chi Omega]], or [[Psi Upsilon]].

The founding of Phi Beta Kappa followed the earlier establishment of two other secret student societies that had existed at that campus as early as 1750. In 1779 Phi Beta Kappa expanded to include chapters at Harvard and Yale.  By the early 19th century, the organization transformed itself into a scholastic honor society and abandoned secrecy.\n\nIn 1825, [[Kappa Alpha Society]], the oldest extant fraternity to retain its social characteristic, was established at [[Union College]]. In 1827, [[Sigma Phi]] and [[Delta Phi]] were also founded at the same institution,<ref name=handbook>{{cite book|last1=Whalen|first1=Richard|title=Handbook of Secret Organizations|date=1967|publisher=Bruce Publishing Company|location=Milwaukee|pages=43\u201345}}</ref> creating the [[Union Triad]].

Their early growth was widely opposed by university administrators, though the increasing influence of fraternity alumni, as well as several high-profile court cases, succeeded in largely muting opposition by the 1880s.<ref name=\"handbook\"/> The first fraternity meeting hall, or lodge, seems to have been that of the Alpha Epsilon chapter of Chi Psi at the [[University of Michigan]] in 1845, leading to a tradition in that fraternity to name its buildings \"lodges\".

Founded in 1902, the NPC is one of the oldest and largest women's membership organizations, representing more than 4 million women at 655 college/university campuses and 4,500 local alumnae chapters in the U.S. and Canada.<ref name=\"about npc\">{{cite web|url=http://www.npcwomen.org/about.aspx|title=National Panhellenic Conference|publisher=National Panhellenic Conference|accessdate=2010-01-01|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090126110021/http://npcwomen.org/about.aspx|archive-date=2009-01-26|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n===Internationalization===\nIn 1867, the [[Chi Phi]] fraternity established its Theta chapter at the [[University of Edinburgh]] in [[Scotland]], marking the first foray of the American social fraternity outside the borders of the United States. At the time, many students from the [[American south]] were moving to Europe to study because of the disrepair southern universities fell into during the [[American Civil War]]. One such group of Americans organized Chi Phi at Edinburgh; however, during the Theta chapter's existence, it initiated no non-American members. With declining American enrollment at European universities, Chi Phi at Edinburgh closed in 1870.<ref name=bairdtwo>{{cite book |last=Anson |first=Jack |date=1991 |title=Baird's Manual of American College Fraternities (20th Edition) |url= |location= |publisher=Bairds Manual Foundation |page=III-32 |isbn=978-0963715906 |accessdate= }}</ref>\n\n[[File:SigEpFlagIraq.jpg|thumb|right|U.S. Air Force, Airmen, presumably members of [[Sigma Phi Epsilon]], display that fraternity's flag in Iraq in 2009.]]\nNine years following Chi Phi's abortive colonization of the University of Edinburgh, a second attempt was made to transplant the fraternity system outside the United States. In 1879, [[Zeta Psi]] established a chapter at the [[University of Toronto]]. Zeta Psi's success at Toronto prompted it to open a second Canadian chapter at [[McGill University]], which it chartered in 1883. Other early foundations were [[Kappa Alpha Society]] at Toronto in 1892 and at McGill in 1899, and [[Alpha Delta Phi]] at Toronto in 1893 and at McGill in 1897. The first sorority, [[Kappa Alpha Theta]], was established at Toronto in 1887. By 1927 there were 42 fraternity and sorority chapters at the University of Toronto and of 23 at McGill University. A few chapters were also reported at the [[University of British Columbia]], [[Carleton University]], [[Dalhousie University]], [[University of Manitoba]], [[Queen's University at Kingston|Queen's University]], [[University of Western Ontario]], [[Wilfrid Laurier University]], [[University of Waterloo]] and [[Brock University]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://faculty.marianopolis.edu/c.belanger/quebechistory/encyclopedia/FraternitiesinCanada.htm |title=Fraternities in Canada |accessdate=2010-08-19 |encyclopedia=The Encyclopedia of Canada, Vol. II |publisher=University Associates of Canada |year=1948}}</ref>\n\nThe arrival of the fraternity system in Asia accompanied the introduction of the American educational system in the Philippines.

While these limitations have since been abolished by both the [[Interfraternity Conference]] and the [[National Pan-Hellenic Council]], students of various ethnicities have come together to form a council of multicultural Greek organizations. The Multicultural Greek Council, officially formed in 1998, is a coordinating body of 19 Greek organizations, including nine fraternities, and ten sororities with cultural affiliations.<ref>{{cite web|title=History of MGC|url=http://mgc.tamu.edu/history|website=Multicultural Greek Council|publisher=Multicultural Greek Council|accessdate=12 October 2015}}</ref>\n\nThe first multicultural sorority, Mu Sigma Upsilon, was established in November 1981 at [[Rutgers University]].<ref name=\"nationalmgc.org\">{{cite web|title=EMERGENCE OF MULTICULTURAL FRATERNAL ORGANIZATIONS|url=http://nationalmgc.org/about/|website=National Multicultural Greek Council|publisher=National Multicultural Greek Council|accessdate=12 October 2015}}</ref>  The formation of this Greek organization allowed for the emergence of a multicultural fraternity and sorority movement, giving birth to a multicultural movement.\n\n==Structure and organization==\n===Common elements===\n====Gender exclusivity====\nFraternities and sororities traditionally have been single-sex organizations, with fraternities consisting exclusively of men and sororities consisting exclusively of women. In the United States, fraternities and sororities have a statutory exemption from [[Title IX]] legislation prohibiting this type of gender exclusion within student groups, and organizations such as the [[Fraternity and Sorority Political Action Committee]] lobby to maintain it.<ref name=\"bi1\">{{cite news|title=Why One School Decided To Make All Of Its Fraternities And Sororities Co-Ed |url=http://www.businessinsider.com/trinity-college-fraternities-sororities-co-ed-2014-10|work=[[Business Insider]]|date=9 October 2014}}</ref><ref name=\"bl\">{{cite news|title=Fraternities Lobby Against Campus Rape Investigations|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-03-24/fraternities-lobby-against-campus-rape-investigations|work=[[Bloomberg News|Bloomberg]]|date=24 March 2015}}</ref>\n\nSince the mid-20th century a small number of fraternities, such as [[Alpha Theta]] and [[Lambda Lambda Lambda]], have opted to become co-educational and admit female members; however, these generally represent a minority of Greek-letter organizations and no such fraternity is currently a member of the North American Interfraternity Conference, the largest international association of fraternities.<ref name=\"bi1\" /><ref name=\"bl\" />  The first coed fraternity was Pi Alpha Tau (1963\u20131991) at the [[University of Illinois at Chicago]].<ref>{{Cite web|title = Pi Alpha Tau Papers, 1963\u20131991, UIC Archives|url = http://findingaids.library.uic.edu/ead/lhsc/059-07-16.pdf|website = uic.edu|accessdate = 6 April 2012}}</ref>\n\nMuch more commonly, coed fraternities exist in the form of \"service\" fraternities such as [[Alpha Phi Omega]], [[Epsilon Sigma Alpha]], Alpha Tau Mu [[Service fraternities and sororities|and others]]. These organizations are similar to \"social\" fraternities and sororities, with the exception of being coed and non-residential.\n\nIn 2016, [[Chi Phi]] began allowing transgender members, or those identifying as male, to join the social fraternity.<ref>http://college.usatoday.com/2016/07/08/chi-phi-transgender-pledges/</ref> Several sororities have adjusted their policies to confirm that transgender prospective members are allowable.\n\nImportantly, all these variants have stemmed from a process of ''self-determination,'' without challenge by other Greeks. But in a [[bellwether]] case, in 2016 Harvard University changed its student conduct code to bar members of single-sex groups from leading campus groups, serving as captains of sports teams or participating in valuable academic fellowships. This clear and unprecedented attempt to eliminate the gender exclusivity that is typically associated with the fraternity and sorority culture is being contested vigorously in U.S. Federal Court by several affected fraternities and sororities, with the support of the broader Greek Life community.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.economist.com/united-states/2019/01/17/harvards-policy-against-single-sex-clubs-was-meant-to-protect-women|title=Harvard's policy against single-sex clubs was meant to protect women|date=2019-01-17|work=The Economist|access-date=2019-01-28|issn=0013-0613}}</ref><ref>[https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/harvard-sued-fraternities-sororities-over-single-sex-rule-n942961 Harvard sued by fraternities and sororities], in an NBC news report dated 3 Dec 2018, accessed 2 Aug 2019.</ref>\n\n====Governance====\nIndividual chapters of fraternities and sororities are largely self-governed by their active (student) members; however, alumni members may retain legal ownership of the fraternity or sorority's property through an alumni chapter or alumni corporation. All of a single fraternity or sorority's chapters are generally grouped together in a national or international organization that sets standards, regulates insignia and ritual, publishes a journal or magazine for all of the chapters of the organization, and has the power to grant and revoke charters to chapters. These federal structures are largely governed by alumni members of the fraternity, though with some input from the active (student) members.<ref>{{cite web|title=GOVERNANCE OF UNDERGRADUATE SOCIAL FRATERNITIES AND SORORITIES|url=http://provost.upenn.edu/policies/pennbook/2013/02/15/recognition-and-governance-of-undergraduate-social-fraternities-and-sororities|website=upenn.edu|publisher=[[University of Pennsylvania]]|accessdate=4 September 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170727030604/http://provost.upenn.edu/policies/pennbook/2013/02/15/recognition-and-governance-of-undergraduate-social-fraternities-and-sororities|archive-date=27 July 2017|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=ERM, ORSA and Corporate Governance: The Small Company Challenges|url=http://www.firstconsulting.com/erm-orsa-and-corporate-governance-small-company-challenges|website=firstconsulting.com|publisher=First Consulting}}</ref>\n\n====Rushing and pledging (recruitment and new member periods)====\n{{See also|Sorority recruitment}}\n\nMost Greek letter organizations select potential members through a two-part process of vetting and probation, called rushing and pledging, respectively. During rush (recruitment), students attend designated social events, and sometimes formal interviews, hosted by the chapters of fraternities and sororities in which they have particular interest. Usually, after a potential new member has attended several such events, officers or current members meet privately to vote on whether or not to extend an invitation (known as a \"bid\") to the prospective applicant. Those applicants who receive a bid, and choose to accept it, are considered to have \"pledged\" the fraternity or sorority, thus beginning the pledge period (new member period). Students participating in rush are known as \"rushees\" (Potential New Members \"PNMs\") while students who have accepted a bid to a specific fraternity or sorority are known as \"new members\" or in some cases \"pledges\".<ref name=tfa>{{cite web|title=Rush and Pledging Problems|url=http://thefraternityadvisor.com/rush-and-pledging-problems/|website=The Fraternity Advisor|accessdate=2 September 2015}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Delta Upsilon Ode2.ogg|thumb|\"Delta Upsilon Ode,\" a traditional [[Delta Upsilon]] song written in 1884 by Edward La Wall Seip (sample)]]\n[[File:\"My Name is Sigma Chi, Sir\".ogg|thumb|\"My Name is Sigma Chi, Sir,\" a traditional Sigma Chi song written in 1885 by Charles Eldridge (sample)]]\nA new member period may last anywhere from one weekend to several months. During this time, new members might participate in almost all aspects of the life of the fraternity or sorority, but most likely not be permitted to hold office in the organization. At the conclusion of the new member period, a second vote of members may sometimes be taken, often, but not always, using a [[blackballing|blackball]] system. New members who pass this second vote are invited to a formal and secret ritual of initiation into the organization, advancing them to full membership.<ref name=handbook/>\n\n[[File:Adphicornell.jpg|thumb|left|The chapter house of [[Alpha Delta Phi]] at [[Cornell University]]]]\nMany Greek-letter organizations give preferential consideration for pledging to candidates whose parent or sibling was a member of the same fraternity or sorority. Such prospective candidates are known as \"legacies\".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.gmu.edu/org/ifc/faq_glossary.htm |title=Glossary of Greek Life Terms |last1= |first1= |last2= |first2= |date= |website=gmu.edu |publisher=George Mason University Interfraternity Council |accessdate=28 December 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150325043212/http://www.gmu.edu/org/ifc/faq_glossary.htm |archive-date=25 March 2015 |url-status=dead }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://thefraternityadvisor.com/fraternity-legacy/ |title=Fraternity Legacies |last1= |first1= |last2= |first2= |date= |website=thefraternityadvisor.com |publisher=The Fraternity Advisor |accessdate=28 December 2014}}</ref>\n\nMembership in more than one fraternity or sorority is almost always prohibited. Recently, some Greek-letter organizations have replaced the term \"pledge\" with that of \"associate member\" or \"new member\".  [[Sigma Alpha Epsilon]], in 2014, abolished pledging altogether. Potential members are now immediately initiated into the fraternity upon accepting a bid.<ref name=tfa/><ref>{{cite news|title=Deadliest U.S. Fraternity Abolishes Pledging for New Members|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2014-03-07/most-deadly-u-s-fraternity-scraps-initiation-for-new-members|work=[[Bloomberg News|Bloomberg]]|issue=7 March 2014}}</ref>\n\n====Residency====\nUnique among most campus organizations, members of social Greek letter organizations often live together in a large house (generally privately owned by the fraternity itself, or by the fraternity's alumni association) or a distinct part of the university dormitories. A single undergraduate fraternity chapter may be composed of anywhere between 20 and more than 100 students, though most have between 35 and 45 members and pledges. Often fraternities and sorority houses (called lodges or chapter houses) are located on the same street or in close quarters within the same neighborhood, which may be colloquially known as \"Greek row\" or \"frat row\". At some, often small, colleges, fraternities and sororities occupy a specific section of university-owned housing provided to them. Some fraternities and sororities are un-housed, with members providing for their own accommodations. In many of these cases, the fraternity or sorority own or rent a non-residential clubhouse to use for meetings and other activities. \n[[File:KappaKappaGammaSororityHouse Urbana Illinois 4419.jpg|thumb|The Kappa Kappa Gamma chapter house at the University of Illinois]]\n[[File:Zeta Psi Fraternity House, Lafayette College 01.JPG|left|thumb|The [[Zeta Psi]] chapter house at [[Lafayette College]]]]\n\n====Secrecy and ritual====\nWith a few exceptions, most fraternities and sororities are secret societies. While the identity of members or officers is rarely concealed, fraternities and sororities initiate members following the pledge period through sometimes elaborate private rituals, frequently drawn or adopted from Masonic ritual practice or that of the Greek mysteries.<ref name=handbook/>\n\nAt the conclusion of an initiation ritual, the organization's secret motto, secret purpose and secret identification signs, such as handshakes and passwords, are usually revealed to its new members.

Most fraternities also have assumed heraldic achievements. Members of fraternities and sororities address members of the same organization as \"brother\" (in the case of fraternities) or \"sister\" (in the case of sororities). The names of almost all fraternities and sororities consist of a sequence of two or three Greek letters, for instance, [[Delta Delta Delta]], [[Sigma Chi]], [[Chi Omega]], or [[Psi Upsilon]].

Hazing during the pledge period can sometimes culminate in an event commonly known as \"Hell Week\" in which a week-long series of physical and mental torments are inflicted on pledges. Common hazing practices include sleep deprivation, sensory deprivation, [[Paddle (spanking)|paddling]] and other types of spanking, use of [[stress positions]], forced runs, [[Busy work#Military settings|busy work]], forced drinking and [[mind games]]. Rarer incidents involving [[human branding|branding]], [[enemas]], urination on pledges and the forced consumption of [[spoiled food]] have been reported. Hazing, in many cases, has been reported and has led to the permanent disposal of particular chapters of fraternities and sororities across the country.\n\n[[File:Flying Machine.jpg|thumb|left|A depiction of fraternity hazing from the early 20th century]]\nSupporters of fraternities note that hazing is almost universally prohibited by national fraternity organizations, and the occurrence of hazing in undergraduate fraternity chapters goes against official policy. Supporters of fraternities also note that hazing is not unique to Greek-letter organizations and is often reported in other student organizations, such as athletic teams.\n\nIn 2007, an anti-hazing hotline was set up to report incidents of hazing on college campuses. Currently, 46 national fraternity and sorority organizations support the toll-free number, which generates automatic email messages regarding hazing and sends them to the national headquarters directly from the National Anti-Hazing Hotline.<ref>{{Cite web|title = Fraternal Law \u00bb Anti-Hazing Hotline|url = http://fraternallaw.com/contact/anti-hazing-hotline/|website = fraternallaw.com|accessdate = 2015-10-04|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20151027112504/http://fraternallaw.com/contact/anti-hazing-hotline/|archive-date = 2015-10-27|url-status = dead}}</ref> Every year, the last week of September is considered to be National Hazing Prevention Week (NHPW). From hazingprevention.org, \"NHPW is an opportunity for campuses, schools, communities, organizations and individuals to raise awareness about the problem of hazing, educating others about hazing, and promoting the prevention of hazing.
