As of October 2017 there were at least 1,246 confirmed deaths in the UK of people who were killed by the clotting agents Factor VIII & Factor IX and the viruses they transmitted. Some have estimated that the total number of those who have died could be as high as 2,400 though exact figures are not known.\n\nDuring the 1970s and 1980s, some people were infected with Hepatitis C via blood transfusions under entirely different circumstances. However, the Factor Concentrate products used by people with haemophilia were processed pharmaceutical products which bore no resemblance to blood transfusion. The infections to those with haemophilia were principally caused by the [[Blood plasma|plasma]] derived product known as [[Factor VIII]], a medicinal product that was sourced from the United States and elsewhere. The creation of such products involved dangerous manufacturing processes.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.kpbs.org/news/2011/aug/04/bad-blood-cautionary-tale/|title=Bad Blood: A Cautionary Tale|website=Kpbs.org}}</ref> Large groups of paid donors were used (as many as 60,000 per batch, and including prisoners and drug addicts); it only required one infected donor to contaminate an entire batch, which would then infect all of the patients that received that material.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hemophilia.in/index.php/patient-education/product-safety|title=Hemophilia Federation (India) \u2013 Product Safety|website=Hemophilia.in}}</ref> In contrast, this was at a time when the practice of paying donors for [[whole blood]] in the United States had effectively ceased; the UK did not import whole blood<ref>{{cite web|last1= Glenarthur |first1=Simon|title=Blood: Licensing Requirements|url=http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/lords/1983/dec/05/blood-licensing-requirements|website=Hansard|publisher=House of Lords}}</ref> from abroad, but it did import large quantities of Factor VIII given to those infected (as described in the documentary ''[[Factor 8: The Arkansas Prison Blood Scandal]]'').

For example, the ministerial papers of Lord Owen had been destroyed. \"We have been unable to ascertain who carried out the destruction of the papers, and who gave the instructions. But the conclusion appears inescapable that some official made a decision which he or she had no authority to make, or that someone was guilty of a serious error of judgement. The consequence is that Lord Owen has done his best to recollect details of events a quarter of a century ago, but both he, and we, have been deprived of the primary sources\", Archer reported. Lord Jenkin also voiced his difficulties obtaining documents for the inquiry, although the report stated: \"He subsequently received from the Department two bundles of documents.

But the conclusion appears inescapable that some official made a decision which he or she had no authority to make, or that someone was guilty of a serious error of judgement. The consequence is that Lord Owen has done his best to recollect details of events a quarter of a century ago, but both he, and we, have been deprived of the primary sources\", Archer reported. Lord Jenkin also voiced his difficulties obtaining documents for the inquiry, although the report stated: \"He subsequently received from the Department two bundles of documents.

The mansion was constructed  during the years following 1883 for the English financier and politician Sir [[Herbert Leon]] in the Victorian Gothic, Tudor, and Dutch Baroque styles, on the site of older buildings of the same name. During [[World War II]], the estate housed the British [[Government Code and Cypher School]] (GC&CS), which regularly penetrated the secret communications of the [[Axis Powers]]{{snd}}most importantly the German [[Enigma (machine)|Enigma]] and [[Lorenz cipher|Lorenz]] ciphers; among its most notable early personnel the GC&CS team of codebreakers included [[Alan Turing]], [[Gordon Welchman]], [[Conel Hugh O'Donel Alexander|Hugh Alexander]] and [[Stuart Milner-Barry]]. The nature of the work there was secret until many years after the war.\n\nAccording to the official historian of British Intelligence, the \"[[Ultra]]\" intelligence produced at Bletchley shortened the war by two to four years, and without it the outcome of the war would have been uncertain.<ref name=\"HinsleyLecture\">{{Harvnb|Hinsley|1996}}</ref> The team at Bletchley Park devised automatic machinery to help with decryption, culminating in the  development of [[Colossus computer|Colossus]], the world's first programmable digital electronic computer.{{efn|Colossus itself was designed and built by [[Tommy Flowers]] at the [[Post Office Research Station]] at [[Dollis Hill]] in London, to solve a problem posed by mathematician [[Max Newman]] at the GC&CS. From there, it (and nine more) were installed and operated in Bletchley.}} Codebreaking operations at Bletchley Park came to an end in 1946 and all information about the wartime operations was classified until the mid 1970s. After the war, the [[General Post Office|Post Office]] took over the site and used it as a management school, but by 1990 the huts in which the codebreakers worked were being considered for demolition and redevelopment. The Bletchley Park Trust was formed in 1991 to save large portions of the site from developers. More recently, Bletchley Park has been open to the public and houses interpretive exhibits and rebuilt huts as they would have appeared during their wartime operations. It receives hundreds of thousands of visitors annually.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bletchleypark.org.uk/news/v.rhtm/Bletchley_Park_welcomes_2015s_200000th_visitor-908901.html|title=Bletchley Park Welcomes 2015'S 200,000th Visitor|publisher=Bletchley Park|date=26 August 2015|accessdate=25 January 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170202043901/https://www.bletchleypark.org.uk/news/v.rhtm/Bletchley_Park_welcomes_2015s_200000th_visitor-908901.html|archive-date=2 February 2017|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}</ref> The separate [[The National Museum of Computing|National Museum of Computing]], which includes a working replica [[Bombe]] machine and a rebuilt [[Colossus computer]], is housed in Block H on the site.\n\n==History==\nThe site appears in the [[Domesday Book]] as part of the [[Water Eaton, Milton Keynes|Manor of Eaton]].

In 1939{{ndash}}40, [[John Tiltman]] (who had worked on Russian Army traffic from 1930) set up two Russian sections at Wavendon (a country house near Bletchley) and at [[Sarafand al-Amar|Sarafand]] in Palestine. Two Russian high-grade army and navy systems were broken early in 1940. Tiltman spent two weeks in Finland, where he obtained Russian traffic from Finland and Estonia in exchange for radio equipment. In June 1941, when the Soviet Union became an ally, Churchill ordered a halt to intelligence operations against it. In December 1941, the Russian section was closed down, but in late summer 1943 or late 1944, a small GC&CS Russian cypher section was set up in London overlooking Park Lane, then in Sloane Square.<ref>{{Citation |last=Smith |first=Michael | author-link = Michael Smith (newspaper reporter) |title=The Government Code and Cypher School and the First Cold War |year=2011 |pages=13\u201334}} in {{Harvnb|Erskine|Smith|2011}}</ref>\n\n===Japanese signals===\nAn outpost of the Government Code and Cypher School had been set up in Hong Kong in 1935, the [[Far East Combined Bureau]] (FECB).

The mansion was constructed  during the years following 1883 for the English financier and politician Sir [[Herbert Leon]] in the Victorian Gothic, Tudor, and Dutch Baroque styles, on the site of older buildings of the same name. During [[World War II]], the estate housed the British [[Government Code and Cypher School]] (GC&CS), which regularly penetrated the secret communications of the [[Axis Powers]]{{snd}}most importantly the German [[Enigma (machine)|Enigma]] and [[Lorenz cipher|Lorenz]] ciphers; among its most notable early personnel the GC&CS team of codebreakers included [[Alan Turing]], [[Gordon Welchman]], [[Conel Hugh O'Donel Alexander|Hugh Alexander]] and [[Stuart Milner-Barry]]. The nature of the work there was secret until many years after the war.\n\nAccording to the official historian of British Intelligence, the \"[[Ultra]]\" intelligence produced at Bletchley shortened the war by two to four years, and without it the outcome of the war would have been uncertain.<ref name=\"HinsleyLecture\">{{Harvnb|Hinsley|1996}}</ref> The team at Bletchley Park devised automatic machinery to help with decryption, culminating in the  development of [[Colossus computer|Colossus]], the world's first programmable digital electronic computer.{{efn|Colossus itself was designed and built by [[Tommy Flowers]] at the [[Post Office Research Station]] at [[Dollis Hill]] in London, to solve a problem posed by mathematician [[Max Newman]] at the GC&CS. From there, it (and nine more) were installed and operated in Bletchley.}} Codebreaking operations at Bletchley Park came to an end in 1946 and all information about the wartime operations was classified until the mid 1970s. After the war, the [[General Post Office|Post Office]] took over the site and used it as a management school, but by 1990 the huts in which the codebreakers worked were being considered for demolition and redevelopment. The Bletchley Park Trust was formed in 1991 to save large portions of the site from developers. More recently, Bletchley Park has been open to the public and houses interpretive exhibits and rebuilt huts as they would have appeared during their wartime operations. It receives hundreds of thousands of visitors annually.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bletchleypark.org.uk/news/v.rhtm/Bletchley_Park_welcomes_2015s_200000th_visitor-908901.html|title=Bletchley Park Welcomes 2015'S 200,000th Visitor|publisher=Bletchley Park|date=26 August 2015|accessdate=25 January 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170202043901/https://www.bletchleypark.org.uk/news/v.rhtm/Bletchley_Park_welcomes_2015s_200000th_visitor-908901.html|archive-date=2 February 2017|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}</ref> The separate [[The National Museum of Computing|National Museum of Computing]], which includes a working replica [[Bombe]] machine and a rebuilt [[Colossus computer]], is housed in Block H on the site.\n\n==History==\nThe site appears in the [[Domesday Book]] as part of the [[Water Eaton, Milton Keynes|Manor of Eaton]]. [[Browne Willis]] built a mansion there in 1711, but after Thomas Harrison purchased the property in 1793 this was pulled down.

They devised automatic machinery to help with decryption, which culminated in [[Colossus computer|Colossus]], the world's first programmable digital electronic computer. This was designed and built by [[Tommy Flowers]] and his team at the [[Post Office Research Station]] at [[Dollis Hill]]. The prototype first worked in December 1943, was delivered to Bletchley Park in January and first worked operationally on 5 February 1944.

Two Russian high-grade army and navy systems were broken early in 1940. Tiltman spent two weeks in Finland, where he obtained Russian traffic from Finland and Estonia in exchange for radio equipment. In June 1941, when the Soviet Union became an ally, Churchill ordered a halt to intelligence operations against it. In December 1941, the Russian section was closed down, but in late summer 1943 or late 1944, a small GC&CS Russian cypher section was set up in London overlooking Park Lane, then in Sloane Square.<ref>{{Citation |last=Smith |first=Michael | author-link = Michael Smith (newspaper reporter) |title=The Government Code and Cypher School and the First Cold War |year=2011 |pages=13\u201334}} in {{Harvnb|Erskine|Smith|2011}}</ref>\n\n===Japanese signals===\nAn outpost of the Government Code and Cypher School had been set up in Hong Kong in 1935, the [[Far East Combined Bureau]] (FECB).
