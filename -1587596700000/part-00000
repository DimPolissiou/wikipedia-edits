Created by [[Merrill Heatter]] (who also produced the show's predecessor ''[[Gambit (game show)|Gambit]]''), the series follows three contestants as they play a card game centered on [[blackjack]] and trivia. The show is based on a popular online game from GSN's website and aired for four seasons from 2008 to 2011. It was hosted by [[Alfonso Ribeiro]], with actress [[Mikki Padilla]] serving as the card dealer.\n\nThe show received positive critical reception as a whole; the series itself was hailed as \"a fun game with a solid concept\" while Ribeiro was praised as \"hands-down, one of the best game show hosts out there.\" Additionally, the series was acquired by [[Bounce TV]] in 2013, with the network hopeful it could \"add fuel\" to the channel's growing momentum. GSN revived the series on October 14, 2019, with Ribiero returning to host and [[Witney Carson]] as the card dealer.\n\n==Gameplay==\nits stupid\n\n===Bonus round===\nThe winner now controls three separate hands, each staked with one card.

The host reads questions and the first contestant to answer correctly is dealt a card. The contestant who answers correctly can freeze their hand, preventing them from receiving additional cards or reveal the next card from the top of the deck.<ref name=\"Facts\">{{cite web|url=http://corp.gsn.com/shows/catch-21-season-2/fact-sheet/catch-21-fact-sheet|title=''Catch 21'' Fact Sheet|publisher=GSN Corporate|accessdate=July 24, 2016|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160724130350/http://corp.gsn.com/shows/catch-21-season-2/fact-sheet/catch-21-fact-sheet|archivedate=July 24, 2016|url-status=dead}}</ref> \n\nAfter revealing the card, the contestant can either accept it for themselves or pass it to one of their opponents who has not yet frozen. If keeping a card, the contestant in control is given another chance to freeze. However, once a contestant has frozen, the remaining contestants must freeze at a score higher than that contestant; ties are not permitted. A contestant is eliminated from the round if their hand exceeds 21.<ref name=\"about\">{{cite web|url=https://www.thoughtco.com/catch-21-explained-1396945|title=''Catch 21'' Explained|work=ThoughtCo|publisher=[[Dotdash]]|last=Grosvenor|first=Carrie|accessdate=February 8, 2015|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170401022643/https://www.thoughtco.com/catch-21-explained-1396945|archivedate=April 1, 2019}}</ref> \n\nThe process is repeated with additional questions and cards until two contestants have frozen or busted. A contestant whose score reaches 21 exactly instantly wins the round. Beginning in season two of the original series, a bonus prize is given to the contestant regardless of the outcome of the game.<ref>{{cite episode|series=Catch 21|season=2|number=1|date=April 6, 2009|network=[[Game Show Network]]}}</ref> If two contestants bust, the remaining contestant automatically wins the round. If only one contestant has not yet frozen or busted, no additional questions are asked; the remaining contestant continues drawing cards until either beating the highest frozen hand or busting. The winner of the round receives a power chip to use in the bonus round, assuming that contestant gets that far. The original series used point scores in the first two rounds, with 100 points awarded for a correct answer, and 500 for winning the hand. After two rounds, the contestant with the lowest score is eliminated.<ref name=\"about\"/> \n\nIf there is a tie for the lowest score, the players involved participate in a high-card draw. Each player is given the choice of taking the first or second card off the top of the deck, without being able to see either card before making their selection. The player who draws the higher card advances.\n\nThe two remaining contestants play one more round involving the same toss-up question format, but point scores are not kept.

Additionally, the jacks of spades and clubs allow any column to be cleared immediately for 75 points (called a \"Blackjack Attack\").<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gsn.com/games/free/catch21/|title=Play ''Catch 21'' \u2013 GSN Games|work=GSN.com|publisher=Game Show Network, LLC|accessdate=July 24, 2016}}</ref>\n\n==Production==\n {{multiple image\n | width1 = 146\n | image1 = Alfonso Ribeiro.JPG\n | caption1 = [[Alfonso Ribeiro]], host of both versions\n | width2 = 153\n | image2 = Witney Carson 2019 by Glenn Francis.jpg\n | caption2 = [[Witney Carson]], card dealer in the 2019 revival\n }}\nThe series featured executive producers [[Scott Sternberg]] and [[Merrill Heatter (screenwriter)|Merrill Heatter]],<ref name=\"Facts\"/> and premiered on July 21, 2008.<ref name=\"about\"/><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/07/07/business/media/07game.html|title=Blackjack Makes a Move From the Web to Television|last=Stelter|first=Brian|authorlink=Brian Stelter|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=July 7, 2008|accessdate=March 31, 2017}}</ref> The first season consisted of 40 half-hour episodes.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://variety.com/2008/tv/news/gsn-shuffles-catch-21-1117988526/|title=GSN shuffles ''Catch 21''|last=Dempsey|first=John|work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|date=July 7, 2008|accessdate=October 21, 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/catch-21-situation-gsn-115124|title=''Catch 21'' situation for GSN|work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]]|agency=[[Associated Press]]|date=April 6, 2008|accessdate=October 21, 2019}}</ref> Prior to the show's premiere, a 30-minute documentary ''The Making of a Game Show: Catch 21'' aired on GSN, featuring exclusive footage and interviews with production staff and Ribeiro.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.multichannel.com/news/gsn-looks-hit-big-catch-21-365785|title=GSN Looks To Hit Big With ''Catch 21''|last=Reynolds|first=Mike|work=[[Multichannel News]]|date=July 7, 2008|accessdate=October 21, 2019}}</ref> The name of the show is inspired by ''[[Catch-22]]'', a phrase describing a paradox that cannot be avoided due to limits or a rules contradiction.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.newscaststudio.com/2019/10/07/catch-21-preview/|title=Game Show Network keeps host, shuffles its look for new ''Catch 21''|last=Hill|first=Michael P.|work=NewscastStudio.com|date=October 7, 2019|accessdate=October 22, 2019}}</ref>\n\nOn February 18, 2009, GSN renewed the series for a 65-episode second season on April 6, 2009, which featured the addition of an extra power chip in the bonus round in order to increase contestant's chances of winning the top prize.<ref name=\"Facts\"/><ref name=\"Season2renew\"/> A third season, which was announced on September 16, 2009, debuted on October 12, 2009, with some episodes featuring celebrities with a common bond (such as three ''[[The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air]]'' cast members or three former child stars) playing for charity.<ref>{{cite press release|url=http://corp.gsn.com/press/releases/gsn-announces-return-hit-series-newlywed-game-and-catch-21-premiering-october-12 |title=GSN Announces the Return of Hit Series ''The Newlywed Game'' and ''Catch 21'', Premiering October 12 |publisher=GSN Corporate |date=September 16, 2009 |accessdate=November 1, 2014 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160817114152/http://corp.gsn.com/press/releases/gsn-announces-return-hit-series-newlywed-game-and-catch-21-premiering-october-12 |archivedate=August 17, 2016 |url-status=dead }}</ref> The show's fourth and final season debuted on August 16, 2010.<ref>{{cite press release|url=http://corp.gsn.com/press/releases/baggage-and-catch-21-both-return-august-16 |title=''Baggage'' and ''Catch 21'' Both Return on August 16 |publisher=GSN Corporate |date=July 26, 2010 |accessdate=November 1, 2014 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160817120614/http://corp.gsn.com/press/releases/baggage-and-catch-21-both-return-august-16 |archivedate=August 17, 2016 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nOn March 21, 2019, ''[[Adweek]]'' reported that GSN would revive ''Catch 21'', producing new episodes for the first time in nearly a decade.

Monier-Williams also conjectures that the root ''drish'' (to see) might have given rise to an obsolete root ''rish'' meaning \"to see\".\n\nHowever, the root has a close [[Avestan]] cognate ''\u0259r\u0259\u0161i\u0161''<ref>[[Yasna]] 31.5; cf. 40.4</ref> \"an [[Religious ecstasy|ecstatic]]\" (see also [[Yurodivy]], [[Vates]]).

In Sanskrit, forms of the root ''rish'' become ''arsh-'' in many words, (e.g., ''arsh'')\n\nModern etymological explanations such as by [[Manfred Mayrhofer]] in his ''Etymological Dictionary''<ref>''Etymologisches W\u00f6rterbuch des Altindoarischen'', Heidelberg 1986, I 261</ref> leave the case open, and do not prefer a connection to ''{{IAST|\u1e5b\u1e63}}'' \"pour, flow\" ([[PIE]] ''{{PIE|*h<sub>1</sub>ers}}''), rather one with German ''rasen'' \"to be ecstatic, be in a different state of mind\" (and perhaps Lithuanian ''ar\u0161us'').\n\n\n\n==\"Seer\" of the Vedas==\n[[File:Rishi.jpg|thumb|A temple relief showing a Rishi.]]\nIn the [[Vedas]], the word denotes an inspired poet of Vedic hymns.<ref name=scharfe13/> In particular, \u1e5a\u1e63i refers to the authors of the hymns of the [[Rigveda]].

The Mah\u0101bh\u0101rata list explicitly refers to the saptarshis of the first [[manvantara]]<ref name=\"Williams\" /> and not to those of the present manvantara. Each manvantara had a unique set of saptarshi. In Harivamsha 417ff, the names of the Rishis of each manvantara are enumerated.\n\nIn addition to the Sapta{{IAST|r\u1e63i}}, there are other classifications of sages. In descending order of precedence, they are [[Brahmarshi]], [[Maharshi]], [[Rajarshi]]. Deva{{IAST|r\u1e63i}}, Param{{IAST|r\u1e63i}}, Shruta{{IAST|r\u1e63i}} and K\u0101nda{{IAST|r\u1e63i}} are added in Manusmriti iv-94 and xi-236 and in two dramas of K\u0101lidasa.\n\nThe Chaturvarga-Chint\u0101mani of Hem\u0101dri puts '{{IAST|ri\u1e63i}}' at the seventh place in the eightfold division of Br\u0101hmanas. [[Amarakosha]]<ref>Amarakosha (2.7.41\u201342)</ref> (the famous Sanskrit synonym lexicon compiled by Amarasimha) mentions seven types of {{IAST|ri\u1e63i}}s : Shrutarshi, K\u0101ndarshi, Paramarshi, Maharshi, R\u0101jarshi, Brahmarshi and Devarshi. Amarakosha strictly distinguishes Rishi from other types of sages, such as sany\u0101si, {{IAST|bhik\u1e63u}}, parivr\u0101jaka, tapasvi, muni, brahmach\u0101ri, yati, etc.\n\n==Rishi in Indonesia and Khmer temples==\nMost medieval era [[Candi of Indonesia|Hindu temples of Java]], [[Indonesia]] show Rishi [[Agastya]] statues or reliefs, usually guarding the southern side of [[Shaivite]] temples.<ref name=jmcdaniel309/> Some examples include [[Candi Sambisari]] and the Prambanan temple near [[Yogyakarta]].<ref>Maud Girard-Geslan et al (1997), Art of Southeast Asia, Harry Abrams, Paris, page 350</ref> Rishi Agastya is known as Phra Reusi Akkhot in Thailand.<ref name=jmcdaniel309/>\n\n==Ruesi in Cambodia, Thailand, Myanmar and Laos==\n[[File:2013 Wat Suan Tan 02.jpg|thumb|A statue of a Ruesi at Wat Suan Tan in [[Nan, Thailand]]]]\n'''Ruesi''' (sanskrit: ''\u1e5b\u1e63i'', {{lang-km|\u178f\u17b6\u17a5\u179f\u17b8}}, {{lang-th|\u0e24\u0e45\u0e29\u0e35}}, {{lang-lo|\u0ea5\u0eb7\u0eaa\u0eb5}}) is a [[hermit]] [[List of types of spiritual teachers|sage]], the equivalent of Rishi in [[India]].

In Sanskrit, forms of the root ''rish'' become ''arsh-'' in many words, (e.g., ''arsh'')\n\nModern etymological explanations such as by [[Manfred Mayrhofer]] in his ''Etymological Dictionary''<ref>''Etymologisches W\u00f6rterbuch des Altindoarischen'', Heidelberg 1986, I 261</ref> leave the case open, and do not prefer a connection to ''{{IAST|\u1e5b\u1e63}}'' \"pour, flow\" ([[PIE]] ''{{PIE|*h<sub>1</sub>ers}}''), rather one with German ''rasen'' \"to be ecstatic, be in a different state of mind\" (and perhaps Lithuanian ''ar\u0161us'').\n\n\n\n==\"Seer\" of the Vedas==\n[[File:Rishi.jpg|thumb|A temple relief showing a Rishi.]]\nIn the [[Vedas]], the word denotes an inspired poet of Vedic hymns.<ref name=scharfe13/> In particular, \u1e5a\u1e63i refers to the authors of the hymns of the [[Rigveda]]. Some of the earliest lists of ''Rishi'' are found in Jaiminiya Brahmana verse 2.218 and [[Brihadaranyaka Upanishad]] verse 2.2.6.<ref name=jmcdaniel309>Justin McDaniel (2013), This Hindu holy man is a Thai Buddhist, South East Asia Research, Volume 21, Number 2, page 309, 303-321</ref>\n\nPost-Vedic tradition regards the Rishis as \"sages\" or [[saint]]s, constituting a peculiar class of divine human beings in the early mythical system, as distinct from [[Asura]]s, [[Deva (Hinduism)|Deva]]s and mortal men. [[Swami Vivekananda]] described \"Rishi\"s as ''Mantra-drashtas'' or \"the seers of thought\". He told\u2014 \"The truth came to the Rishis of India \u2014 the Mantra-drasht\u00e2s, the seers of thought \u2014 and will come to all Rishis in the future, not to talkers, not to book-swallowers, not to scholars, not to philologists, but to seers of thought.\"<ref name=\"Swami Vivekananda on Rishis\">{{cite web|title=Swami Vivekananda on Rishis|url=http://www.swamivivekanandaquotes.org/2014/03/swami-vivekanandas-quotes-on-rishis-and-sages.html|publisher=Swami Vivekananda Quotes|accessdate=12 April 2014}}</ref>\n\nThe notable female [https://web.archive.org/web/20150810021917/http://www.speakingtree.in/spiritual-blogs/masters/philosophy/rshik-s-of-the-rgveda-214571 rishikas] who contributed to the composition of the Vedic scriptures are:\nThe [[Rig Veda]] mentions Romasha, [[Lopamudra]], [[Apala]], [[Kadru]], Visvavara, [[Ghosha]], [[Juhu]], Vagambhrini, Paulomi, [[Yami]], [[Indrani]], [[Savitri and Satyavan|Savitri]] and [[Devayani]].\nThe [[Sama Veda]] adds Nodha, Akrishtabhasha, Sikatanivavari and Gaupayana.\n\nIn [[Mahabharata]] 12, on the other hand, there is the post-Vedic list of [[Marichi|Mar\u012bci]], [[Atri]], [[Angiras (sage)|Angiras]], [[Pulaha]], [[Kratu]], [[Pulastya]] and [[Vashista]]. The Mah\u0101bh\u0101rata list explicitly refers to the saptarshis of the first [[manvantara]]<ref name=\"Williams\" /> and not to those of the present manvantara. Each manvantara had a unique set of saptarshi. In Harivamsha 417ff, the names of the Rishis of each manvantara are enumerated.\n\nIn addition to the Sapta{{IAST|r\u1e63i}}, there are other classifications of sages. In descending order of precedence, they are [[Brahmarshi]], [[Maharshi]], [[Rajarshi]]. Deva{{IAST|r\u1e63i}}, Param{{IAST|r\u1e63i}}, Shruta{{IAST|r\u1e63i}} and K\u0101nda{{IAST|r\u1e63i}} are added in Manusmriti iv-94 and xi-236 and in two dramas of K\u0101lidasa.\n\nThe Chaturvarga-Chint\u0101mani of Hem\u0101dri puts '{{IAST|ri\u1e63i}}' at the seventh place in the eightfold division of Br\u0101hmanas. [[Amarakosha]]<ref>Amarakosha (2.7.41\u201342)</ref> (the famous Sanskrit synonym lexicon compiled by Amarasimha) mentions seven types of {{IAST|ri\u1e63i}}s : Shrutarshi, K\u0101ndarshi, Paramarshi, Maharshi, R\u0101jarshi, Brahmarshi and Devarshi. Amarakosha strictly distinguishes Rishi from other types of sages, such as sany\u0101si, {{IAST|bhik\u1e63u}}, parivr\u0101jaka, tapasvi, muni, brahmach\u0101ri, yati, etc.\n\n==Rishi in Indonesia and Khmer temples==\nMost medieval era [[Candi of Indonesia|Hindu temples of Java]], [[Indonesia]] show Rishi [[Agastya]] statues or reliefs, usually guarding the southern side of [[Shaivite]] temples.<ref name=jmcdaniel309/> Some examples include [[Candi Sambisari]] and the Prambanan temple near [[Yogyakarta]].<ref>Maud Girard-Geslan et al (1997), Art of Southeast Asia, Harry Abrams, Paris, page 350</ref> Rishi Agastya is known as Phra Reusi Akkhot in Thailand.<ref name=jmcdaniel309/>\n\n==Ruesi in Cambodia, Thailand, Myanmar and Laos==\n[[File:2013 Wat Suan Tan 02.jpg|thumb|A statue of a Ruesi at Wat Suan Tan in [[Nan, Thailand]]]]\n'''Ruesi''' (sanskrit: ''\u1e5b\u1e63i'', {{lang-km|\u178f\u17b6\u17a5\u179f\u17b8}}, {{lang-th|\u0e24\u0e45\u0e29\u0e35}}, {{lang-lo|\u0ea5\u0eb7\u0eaa\u0eb5}}) is a [[hermit]] [[List of types of spiritual teachers|sage]], the equivalent of Rishi in [[India]]. In [[Myanmar]], there are some known as \u101b\u1031\u101e\u1037 ''Rase''. {{cn|date=October 2017}}\n\n==Other uses==\nRishi is also a male given name, and less commonly a Brahmin last name. \n\nIn [[Carnatic music]], \"Rishi\" is the seventh ''chakra'' (group) of [[Melakarta]] [[raga]]s. The names of ''chakras'' are based on the numbers associated with each name. In this case, there are [[Saptarishi|seven rishis]] and hence the 7th ''chakra'' is \"Rishi\".<ref name=\"sim\">''South Indian Music'' Book III, by Prof. P Sambamoorthy, Published 1973, The Indian Music Publishing House</ref><ref name=\"ragas\">''Ragas in Carnatic music'' by Dr. S. Bhagyalekshmy, Pub. 1990, CBH Publications</ref>\n\nThe descendant families of these Rishis, refer to their ancestral lineage through their family \"[[gotra]]\". This is a common practice among the Brahmin sects of the current Hindu society.\n\nThe name \"Rishi\" (pronounced \"ruesi\") is also the basis of one of the letters of the [[Thai alphabet]], ''so reu-si'' ({{lang-th|\u0e29 \u0e24\u0e45\u0e29\u0e35}}).\n\n== See also ==\n{{col div|colwidth=20em}}\n*[[Devarishi]]\n*[[Saptarishi]]\n*[[Rishi Panchami]]\n*[[Rishikas]]\n*[[Sadhu]]\n*[[Sennin]]\n*[[Rishabha (Hinduism)]]\n*[[Rishabhanatha]]\n*[[Pravaras]]\n*[[Ataptatanu]]\n*[[Sramana]]\n*[[Apaurusheyatva]]\n*[[Yogi]]\n*[[Yogini]]\n*[[Kavi (disambiguation)|Kavi]]<!--intentional link to DAB page-->\n*[[Rishu]]\n*[[Vidyadhara]]\n*[[Weizza]]\n*[[Xian (Taoism)|Xian]]\n{{colend}}\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist|2}}\n\n==References==\n*{{Citation\n | last =Apte\n | first =Vaman Shivram\n | author-link =\n | author2-link =\n | editor-last=\n | editor-first =\n | year =1965\n | title =The Practical Sanskrit-English Dictionary\n | edition =Fourth Revised and Enlarged\n | place =New Delhi\n | publisher=Motilal Banarsidass\n | isbn =978-81-208-0567-5\n}}\n*{{Citation\n | last =Apte\n | first =Vaman Shivram\n | author-link =\n | author2-link =\n | editor-last=\n | editor-first =\n | year =1966\n | title =Sanskrit-Hindi {{IAST|Ko\u1e63a}}\n | edition =Reprint 1997\n | place =New Delhi\n | publisher=Motilal Banarsidass\n | isbn =\n}}\n*{{Citation\n | last=Chopra\n | first=Deepak\n | year=2006\n | title=Life After Death: The Burden of Proof\n | place=Boston\n | publisher=Harmony Books\n | edition=first\n | isbn=\n}}\n*{{Citation\n | last=Kosambi\n | first=D.

In some jurisdictions (countries, states, provinces or regions), a [[sign language]] is an official language, whereas in others it has a protected status in certain areas such as education. Governments sometimes stipulate in their constitutions or laws that 'sign language' is recognised or protected, but they fail to specify ''which'' sign language exactly, as there may be several different sign languages in common use within its borders, which has led to problems.\n\nExtending legal recognition is one of the major concerns of the international [[Deaf community]], however, symbolic recognition is no guarantee for an effective improvement of the life of sign language users, and it has been argued that sign languages should be recognized and supported not merely as an accommodation for the disabled, but as the communication medium of language communities.<ref>Sarah C.

In some jurisdictions (countries, states, provinces or regions), a [[sign language]] is an official language, whereas in others it has a protected status in certain areas such as education. Governments sometimes stipulate in their constitutions or laws that 'sign language' is recognised or protected, but they fail to specify ''which'' sign language exactly, as there may be several different sign languages in common use within its borders, which has led to problems.\n\nExtending legal recognition is one of the major concerns of the international [[Deaf community]], however, symbolic recognition is no guarantee for an effective improvement of the life of sign language users, and it has been argued that sign languages should be recognized and supported not merely as an accommodation for the disabled, but as the communication medium of language communities.<ref>Sarah C.

[[Leonardo DiCaprio]] stars as [[United States Marshals Service|U.S. Marshal]] Edward \"Teddy\" Daniels, who is investigating a psychiatric facility on Shutter Island after one of the patients goes missing. [[Mark Ruffalo]] plays his partner officer; [[Ben Kingsley]] is the facility's lead psychiatrist; [[Max von Sydow]] is a German doctor; and [[Michelle Williams (actress)|Michelle Williams]] is Daniels's wife. Released on February 19, 2010, the film received mostly positive  reviews from critics, was chosen by [[National Board of Review]] as one of the [[National Board of Review Awards 2010#Top 10 Films|top ten films of 2010]], and grossed over $294 million worldwide.\n\nThe film is also noteworthy for its soundtrack using classical ([[Gustav Mahler]]) and mainly [[Modernism (music)|modern classical music]] by composers such as [[Krzysztof Penderecki]], [[Gy\u00f6rgy Ligeti]], [[John Cage]], [[Ingram Marshall]], and [[Max Richter]].\n\n==Plot==\nIn 1954, [[United States Marshals Service|U.S. Marshals]] Edward Daniels and his new partner Chuck Aule travel to the Ashecliffe Hospital for the [[Insanity defense|criminally insane]] on Shutter Island in [[Boston Harbor]]. They are investigating the disappearance of patient Rachel Solando, incarcerated for drowning her three children. Their only clue is a cryptic note found hidden in Solando's room: \"The law of 4; who is 67?\" The two men arrive just before a massive storm, preventing their return to the mainland for a few days.\n\nDaniels and Aule find the staff confrontational. Lead psychiatrist John Cawley refuses to turn over records, and they learn that Solando's doctor Lester Sheehan left the island on vacation immediately after Solando disappeared. They are told that Ward C is off limits and the lighthouse has already been searched. While being interviewed, one patient writes the word \"RUN\" in Daniels's notepad. Daniels starts to have [[migraine]] headaches from the hospital's atmosphere and has waking visions of his experiences as a U.S. Army soldier during the [[Dachau concentration camp#Liberation|liberation of Dachau]] including [[Dachau liberation reprisals|reprisals against the guards]]. He has disturbing dreams of his wife, Dolores Chanal, who was killed in a fire set by arsonist Andrew Laeddis. In one instance, she tells Daniels that Solando is still on the island\u2014as is Laeddis, who everyone claims was never there. Daniels later explains to Aule that locating Laeddis was his ulterior motive for taking the case.\n\nDaniels and Aule find Solando has resurfaced with no explanation, prompting Daniels to break into the restricted Ward C. He encounters George Noyce, a patient in solitary confinement, who claims that the doctors are experimenting on patients, some of whom are taken to the lighthouse to be [[Lobotomy|lobotomized]]. Noyce warns that everyone else on the island, including Aule, is playing an elaborate game designed for Daniels.\n\nDaniels regroups with Aule and climbs the cliffs toward the lighthouse. They become separated, and Daniels later sees what he believes to be Aule's body on the rocks below. By the time he climbs down, the body has disappeared, but he finds a cave where he discovers a woman in hiding, who claims to be the real Rachel Solando. She states that she is a former psychiatrist at the hospital who discovered the experiments with [[Psychoactive drug|psychotropic medication]] and trans-orbital lobotomy in an attempt to develop [[mind control]] techniques. Before she could report her findings to the authorities, she was forcibly committed to Ashecliffe as a patient. Daniels returns to the hospital, but finds no evidence of Aule ever being there.\n\nConvinced Aule was taken to the lighthouse, Daniels breaks in, only to discover Cawley waiting for him. Cawley explains that Daniels is actually Andrew Laeddis, their \"most dangerous patient\", incarcerated in Ward C for murdering his [[Bipolar disorder|manic depressive]] wife, Dolores, after she drowned their children. Edward Daniels and Rachel Solando are [[anagram]]s of Andrew Laeddis and Dolores Chanal, and the little girl from Laeddis's recurring dreams is his daughter Rachel. According to Cawley, the events of the past several days have been designed to break Laeddis's [[Conspiracy (criminal)|conspiracy]]-laden insanity by allowing him to play out the role of Daniels. The hospital staff were part of the test, including Sheehan posing as Aule and a nurse posing as Rachel Solando. Laeddis\u2019s migraines were withdrawal symptoms from his medication, as were his hallucinations of the \"real Rachel Solando\". Overwhelmed, Laeddis faints.\n\nHe awakens in the hospital under the watch of Cawley and Sheehan. When questioned, he tells the truth in a coherent manner, satisfying the doctors. Cawley notes that they had achieved this state nine months before, but Laeddis quickly regressed. He warns this will be Laeddis's last chance; otherwise, they will have to lobotomize him, as he previously attacked Noyce for calling him by his real name.\n\nSome time later, Laeddis relaxes on the hospital grounds with Sheehan, but calls him \"Chuck\" again, saying they must leave the island because bad things are going on. Sheehan shakes his head to Cawley and Cawley gestures to the orderlies to take Laeddis to be lobotomized. Before being led away, Laeddis asks Sheehan if it would be better \"to live as a monster, or to die as a good man?\"\n\n==Cast==\n<!--CAST LISTINGS SHOULD MATCH CREDITS OF THE FILM.

Cawley's office scenes were the second floor of the chapel during the late evening. Lights were shone through the windows to make it look like it was daytime. The crew painted the hospital's brick walls to look like plywood. This served the dual purpose of acting as scenery and blocking the set from view of a local road.

Released on February 19, 2010, the film received mostly positive  reviews from critics, was chosen by [[National Board of Review]] as one of the [[National Board of Review Awards 2010#Top 10 Films|top ten films of 2010]], and grossed over $294 million worldwide.\n\nThe film is also noteworthy for its soundtrack using classical ([[Gustav Mahler]]) and mainly [[Modernism (music)|modern classical music]] by composers such as [[Krzysztof Penderecki]], [[Gy\u00f6rgy Ligeti]], [[John Cage]], [[Ingram Marshall]], and [[Max Richter]].\n\n==Plot==\nIn 1954, [[United States Marshals Service|U.S. Marshals]] Edward Daniels and his new partner Chuck Aule travel to the Ashecliffe Hospital for the [[Insanity defense|criminally insane]] on Shutter Island in [[Boston Harbor]]. They are investigating the disappearance of patient Rachel Solando, incarcerated for drowning her three children. Their only clue is a cryptic note found hidden in Solando's room: \"The law of 4; who is 67?\" The two men arrive just before a massive storm, preventing their return to the mainland for a few days.\n\nDaniels and Aule find the staff confrontational. Lead psychiatrist John Cawley refuses to turn over records, and they learn that Solando's doctor Lester Sheehan left the island on vacation immediately after Solando disappeared. They are told that Ward C is off limits and the lighthouse has already been searched. While being interviewed, one patient writes the word \"RUN\" in Daniels's notepad. Daniels starts to have [[migraine]] headaches from the hospital's atmosphere and has waking visions of his experiences as a U.S. Army soldier during the [[Dachau concentration camp#Liberation|liberation of Dachau]] including [[Dachau liberation reprisals|reprisals against the guards]]. He has disturbing dreams of his wife, Dolores Chanal, who was killed in a fire set by arsonist Andrew Laeddis. In one instance, she tells Daniels that Solando is still on the island\u2014as is Laeddis, who everyone claims was never there. Daniels later explains to Aule that locating Laeddis was his ulterior motive for taking the case.\n\nDaniels and Aule find Solando has resurfaced with no explanation, prompting Daniels to break into the restricted Ward C. He encounters George Noyce, a patient in solitary confinement, who claims that the doctors are experimenting on patients, some of whom are taken to the lighthouse to be [[Lobotomy|lobotomized]]. Noyce warns that everyone else on the island, including Aule, is playing an elaborate game designed for Daniels.\n\nDaniels regroups with Aule and climbs the cliffs toward the lighthouse. They become separated, and Daniels later sees what he believes to be Aule's body on the rocks below. By the time he climbs down, the body has disappeared, but he finds a cave where he discovers a woman in hiding, who claims to be the real Rachel Solando. She states that she is a former psychiatrist at the hospital who discovered the experiments with [[Psychoactive drug|psychotropic medication]] and trans-orbital lobotomy in an attempt to develop [[mind control]] techniques. Before she could report her findings to the authorities, she was forcibly committed to Ashecliffe as a patient. Daniels returns to the hospital, but finds no evidence of Aule ever being there.\n\nConvinced Aule was taken to the lighthouse, Daniels breaks in, only to discover Cawley waiting for him. Cawley explains that Daniels is actually Andrew Laeddis, their \"most dangerous patient\", incarcerated in Ward C for murdering his [[Bipolar disorder|manic depressive]] wife, Dolores, after she drowned their children. Edward Daniels and Rachel Solando are [[anagram]]s of Andrew Laeddis and Dolores Chanal, and the little girl from Laeddis's recurring dreams is his daughter Rachel. According to Cawley, the events of the past several days have been designed to break Laeddis's [[Conspiracy (criminal)|conspiracy]]-laden insanity by allowing him to play out the role of Daniels. The hospital staff were part of the test, including Sheehan posing as Aule and a nurse posing as Rachel Solando. Laeddis\u2019s migraines were withdrawal symptoms from his medication, as were his hallucinations of the \"real Rachel Solando\". Overwhelmed, Laeddis faints.\n\nHe awakens in the hospital under the watch of Cawley and Sheehan. When questioned, he tells the truth in a coherent manner, satisfying the doctors. Cawley notes that they had achieved this state nine months before, but Laeddis quickly regressed. He warns this will be Laeddis's last chance; otherwise, they will have to lobotomize him, as he previously attacked Noyce for calling him by his real name.\n\nSome time later, Laeddis relaxes on the hospital grounds with Sheehan, but calls him \"Chuck\" again, saying they must leave the island because bad things are going on. Sheehan shakes his head to Cawley and Cawley gestures to the orderlies to take Laeddis to be lobotomized. Before being led away, Laeddis asks Sheehan if it would be better \"to live as a monster, or to die as a good man?\"\n\n==Cast==\n<!--CAST LISTINGS SHOULD MATCH CREDITS OF THE FILM.
