They were sold under the [[Mercedes-Benz E-Class|E-Class]] model names in both [[sedan (car)|sedan]] (saloon) and [[station wagon]] (estate) body types. W210 development started in 1988, three years after the [[W124]]'s introduction. The W210 E-class's appearance, which was designed by Steve Mattin under design chief [[Bruno Sacco]] between 1989 and 1991, heralded a new design idiom for Mercedes, which would continue until the [[Mercedes-Benz CLK-Class (C209)|W209 CLK]]. W210 design work was frozen in May 1992 and developed for a show vehicle by late 1992. This design was previewed on the 1993 Coup\u00e9 Concept shown at the [[Geneva Auto Show#1993|Geneva Auto Show]] in March 1993. Design patents for both the Coup\u00e9 Concept and the W210 E-Class were filed on 25 February 1993 in Germany and 25 August 1993 in the US.<ref>register.dpma.de/DPMAregister/gsm/register?GSNR=M9301492-0001</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.google.com/patents/USD354778|title=Patent USD354778 - Automobile body|work=google.com}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://register.dpma.de/DPMAregister/gsm/register?GSNR=M9301496-0001|title=DPMAregister - Designs - Registerauskunft zum Design|work=dpma.de}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://register.dpma.de/DPMAregister/gsm/register?GSNR=M9301493-0001|title=DPMAregister - Designs - Registerauskunft zum Design|work=dpma.de}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://register.dpma.de/DPMAregister/gsm/register?GSNR=M9301494-0001|title=DPMAregister - Designs - Registerauskunft zum Design|work=dpma.de}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://register.dpma.de/DPMAregister/gsm/register?GSNR=M9301495-0001|title=DPMAregister - Designs - Registerauskunft zum Design|work=dpma.de}}</ref>\n\nOn 21 July 1998, design patents were filed on an updated W210 (designed in 1997).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://register.dpma.de/DPMAregister/gsm/register?GSNR=49807266-0001|title=DPMAregister - Designs - Registerauskunft zum Design|work=dpma.de}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://register.dpma.de/DPMAregister/gsm/register?GSNR=49900461-0001|title=DPMAregister - Designs - Registerauskunft zum Design|work=dpma.de}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://register.dpma.de/DPMAregister/gsm/register?GSNR=49900461-0002|title=DPMAregister - Designs - Registerauskunft zum Design|work=dpma.de}}</ref> As a result, for the 2000 model year, a new multi-function information system was incorporated into the instrument cluster below the speedometer, and the introduction of steering wheel controls for the audio/navigation/phone system. In addition, the 5-speed [[automatic transmission]] introduced \"Touch Shift,\" which used the +/- gate positions for semi-manual control of the gearbox. This electronic system replaced the previous gated shift arrangement and simplified gear changes. Exterior changes included a revised front with a steeper rake, similar to the [[Mercedes-Benz CLK-Class (C208)|CLK]], and restyled bumpers and lower body trim; additionally, sedans received new taillights, while the wagon's tailgate was redesigned, moving the [[Automotive lighting#Centre high mount stop lamp (CHMSL)|CHMSL]] from the base of the rear window to directly above it in the underside of a small integral spoiler lip. The final W210 production included the E 320 and E 430 special editions released in two exterior colors - quartz silver (limited edition), obsidian black, and with Xenon lights, 17-inch alloy wheels and black maple walnut trim. Estate cars (sedans optionally) had Citroen-like self-leveling rear suspension with suspension struts rather than shock absorbers, gas-filled suspension spheres to provide damping and an under bonnet pressurizing pump. Unlike the traditional [[Citro\u00ebn]] application Mercedes opted for a fixed ride height and employed rear coil springs to maintain the static ride height when parked.\n\nIt was the first Mercedes-Benz production car featuring [[Xenon headlamp]]s (including dynamic headlamp range control, only low beam).<ref>http://media.daimler.com/dcmedia/0-921-656548-1-1761294-1-0-1-0-0-1-12639-0-0-1-0-0-0-0-0.html?TS=1420582847031 More light in every situation: Turning night into day</ref>\n\n== Engines ==\n{{Multiple image | align = right | direction = vertical | width =\n| image1 = 1999 Mercedes-Benz E 240 (W 210) Elegance sedan (2011-11-17) 02.jpg\n| caption1 = Sedan (pre-facelift)\n| image2 = 1997 Mercedes-Benz E 240 (S 210) Elegance station wagon (2011-03-10).jpg\n| caption2 = Wagon (pre-facelift)\n| image3 = W210 Avantgarde interieur.jpg\n| caption3 = Interior (pre-facelift)\n}}\n{{Multiple image | align = right | direction = vertical | width =\n| image1 = Mercedes-Benz E-Class W210.jpg\n| image2 = Mercedes E 270 CDI Elegance (W210 Facelift, 1999\u20132002) rear MJ.JPG\n| caption2 = Sedan (facelift)\n| image3 = Mercedes-Benz E320 wagon.jpg\n| caption3 = Wagon (facelift)\n| image4 = Innene.jpg\n| caption4 = Interior (facelift)\n}}\n\nThis was the first time a [[V6]] engine was offered (model year 1998) to replace the [[straight-six engine|straight-six]] configuration (1995\u20131997).

In 1999, Mercedes-Benz discontinued diesel powerplants in the E-class in North America. In Europe, the diesel engines were superseded by more advanced [[Common Rail]] (CDI) units (2000\u20132002).

The 5-speed transmission was marketed as \"sealed for life\"; however, Mercedes dealers now recommend changing the fluid at regular intervals.\n\n== Wheels ==\nThe W210 chassis originally came with one of the following OEM [[wheel]] setups:\n* E 200/E 220 CDI/E 230/E 240(pre-facelift)/E 300 diesel: 15 x 6.5\" ET37\n* E 200 Kompressor/E 240/E 280/E 320/E 420: 16 x 7.5\" ET41\n* E 430: 16 x 7.5\" ET41 (before 2000); 17 x 7.5\" ET41 (after 2000)\n* Sport Package: 17 x 8\" ET37\n* Special Edition: 17 x 8\" ET35\n* E 55 AMG: 18 x 8\" ET31 front, 18 x 9\" ET35 rear.\nET is the German abbreviation for ''Einpresstiefe'' or [[Rim (wheel)#Production|offset]], where the number is in mm and indicates the amount of offset. This ETxx is stamped on the inside of OEM rims for easy reference.\n\nThe bolt pattern is 5x112 (12&nbsp;mm x 1.5 [[lug nut|lugs]]), with an offset range of 30\u201340&nbsp;mm, a wheel size range of 16\"x6.0\" to 20\"x8.5\". This is the same bolt pattern as most Mercedes, including the previous E-Class (W124). The newer Mercedes, including the 2003 (W211) to the present E-Class (W213), have 14&nbsp;mm ball seats, making the wheels interchangeable only with the use of aftermarket lugs that combine a 14 mm ball seat (also known as \"R14\", the \"R\" meaning radius) with a 12 mm thread.\n\n== AMG versions ==\n\nThere were four engines that AMG installed in the W210. The first was the E 36, M104.995, launched in 1996 for select markets then the M119.980 in the E 50 AMG produced from early 1996 until late 1997. This model was assembled in Affalterbach under the one man one engine philosophy, only available in left hand drive European markets although many were exported to Japan from new. It is estimated around 2,800 E 50\u2019s were ever produced in its limited production run. There was also an option for the M119.980 [[V8 engine|V8]] that was bored out to 6.0L and increased power to {{convert|381|PS|kW hp|abbr=on}} the cars these were fitted to were designated as the E 60 and came in sedan and wagon varieties. A limited edition 6.3L version, also badged E 60 AMG were built in 1996 generating {{convert|405|PS|kW hp|abbr=on}} and {{convert|454|ft.lbf|N.m|abbr=on}} of torque. In 1998 came the M113 powered E 55 which used a 5.4L [[V8 engine|V8]] SOHC 24V to produce {{convert|354|PS|kW hp|abbr=on}} and {{convert|391|ft.lbf|N.m|abbr=on}} of torque.\n\nThe body styling on all of the W210 AMG models was the same until 2000 when a facelift and interior upgrades were implemented. The W210 E 55 was the last vehicle for which a major portion of production took place at AMG in Affalterbach. Production was actually split between Affalterbach and the Bremen Mercedes Benz facility until the end of 2001.\n\n== Specifications (European and US versions) ==\n\n=== E 36 AMG ===\n\nThe rarest of all AMG models due to low productions numbers worldwide,{{Citation needed|date=September 2018}} the European-spec E 36 was produced from 1990 - 1993 W124 and 1996 - 1997 W210 and was not available in the US market.

Although this 4Matic system shares its name with the 90's 4MATIC system of the W124 300E, the system was totally redesigned and simplified. Rather than using the clutches and couplings of the earlier design, Mercedes opted to use three open differentials: front, center, and rear. The front suspension design of the 4Matic-equipped models is different to the rear wheel drive models and makes some replacement parts (such as shock absorbers) more expensive.\n\nThe E 55 AMG was available on request with 4Matic option, based on the driveline of the E 430.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Svendsen |first1=Jan Harry |title=E55 AMG 4Matic: Med grep om vinteren |url=https://www.dinside.no/motor/e55-amg-4matic-med-grep-om-vinteren/62866865 |website=DinSide.no |accessdate=30 October 2019 |language=no |date=24 November 1999}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=E 55 AMG 4MATIC station wagon |url=https://mercedes-benz-publicarchive.com/marsClassic/en/instance/ko/E-55-AMG-4MATIC-station-wagon.xhtml?oid=5412 |website=marsClassic |accessdate=30 October 2019 |language=en}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Der Maximal-E |url=https://www.autobild.de/artikel/mercedes-e-55-t-amg-4matic-34068.html |website=autobild.de |accessdate=30 October 2019}}</ref>\n\n== Reliability concerns ==\nSome known problems include the front spring perch has corroded and tearing away from the inner fender (wing), causing the front suspension to collapse. (4Matic models are not believed to be affected.) Other problems include defective harmonic balancer pulleys (recall), rust on trunk lid near latch, rust on Mercedes emblem on front hood, rust on door frames under window seals (recall), rust on front wings just above bumper, defective mass airflow meter, melted rear light bulb sockets, defective blower motor regulators, and rear window regulator failures.\n\n'''Harmonic Balancer''' - Some M112 and M113 engines used in W210 models were equipped with a [[Harmonic balancer|harmonic balancer pulley]] which, due to a supplier quality problem, may fail and cause engine damage. If the rubber insert of the harmonic balancer pulley delaminates, the pulley may grind through the timing chain cover and oil pan, causing several thousand dollars of damage. Mercedes-Benz USA issued Service Campaign #2005-020003<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.barringer1.com/jul04prb_files/Mercedes-Harmonic-Balancer-Recall.pdf |title=~m |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=1 October 2010}}</ref> which included inspection of the part and replacement if necessary at no cost. The part number on the harmonic balancer pulley can be compared to those given to Mercedes-Benz dealers in the Service Campaign notice<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.peachparts.com/shopforum/showthread.php?t=119790 |title=It's official. Harmonic Balancer Service Campaign released 4/5/05 - PeachParts Mercedes ShopForum |publisher=Peachparts.com |date= |accessdate=1 October 2010}}</ref> to determine if the part is a faulty original or has been replaced with the updated part. Replacement of the faulty part with the updated part should be a permanent solution to this problem.\n\n'''Blower Motor Regulator''' - If this part fails, the climate control fan will not operate faster than approximately 50% power. Mercedes updated the regulator to improve its reliability, but the redesigned regulator requires the installation of a new blower motor. The old-style regulator, which is compatible with the existing blower motor, is no longer manufactured. The blower motor regulator may be replaced with the much less expensive W140 S-class blower regulator, provided that the E-class wiring harness is re-attached to the S-class regulator.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mbworld.org/forums/e-class-w210/153918-early-w210-blower-motor-regulator-replacement-diy-here.html |title=Early W210 Blower Motor Regulator Replacement DIY Here... - MBWorld.org Forums |publisher=Mbworld.org |date= |accessdate=1 October 2010}}</ref>\n\n'''Front Sway Bar Drop Links''' - While not a serious concern, most E-classes end up with a sub {{convert|35|mi/h|km/h|abbr=on}} clicking or rattling sound from the front end. This is usually due to worn out front-end sway-bar drop links. These can easily be replaced by anybody with minor knowledge of vehicle DIY, for no more than around \u00a320.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.benzworld.org/forums/w210-e-class/1346654-photo-diy-swaybar-bushing-link-r.html |title=Photo DIY- SwayBar Bushing and Link R/R - Benzworld.org - Mercedes-Benz Discussion Forum |publisher=Benzworld.org |date= |accessdate=1 October 2010}}</ref>\n\n'''Front Spring Perches''' - Some owners have reported rust problems on the front spring perches - the top perches, which hold the tops of the springs for the front suspension. The perches are spot welded to the chassis, and factory coated in a weatherproof mastic to stop their rusting, however in some rare occurrences, water gets behind the mastic causing the perches to rust and eventually to fail - leading to collapse of the suspension. The car remains controllable. This is a problem that Mercedes USA have acknowledged. The problem is not identifiable without first removing the mastic to check.\n\n'''Body corrosion''' - Most model year versions of the W210 displayed body rust, notably on European-sold cars. Rust would sometimes appear spontaneously on panels such as doors and roofs on cars less than a year old. In response to this problem, the manufacturer would in some cases change or repair the affected panels under warranty or good will.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mbworld.org/forums/e-class-w210/69747-potential-rust-problem-all-w210-doors.html |title=Potential rust problem on all W210 doors!!! - MBWorld.org Forums |publisher=Mbworld.org |date= |accessdate=1 October 2010}}</ref> Mercedes-Benz has been criticized in the European press for not officially acknowledging this problem. This was due to problems introducing water-based paint technology within the German automobile industry, between the years 1998-2002.\n\n'''Window regulators''' - The power window regulator, essentially the mechanism that transfers power from the electric motor to the window, has a few plastic parts that can fail after several years causing the power window to stop operating.<ref>{{cite web|author=|url=http://www.benzworld.org/forums/w210-e-class/1226700-diy-pictorial-window-regulator-replacement.html |title=DIY pictorial window regulator replacement - Benzworld.org - Mercedes-Benz Discussion Forum |publisher=Benzworld.org |date= |accessdate=1 October 2010}}</ref>\n\n'''Cylinder Head Gasket''' - The cylinder head gasket on the M104 is known to fail, causing an oil leak at the rear of the cylinder head.<ref>{{cite web|author=|url=http://www.benzworld.org/forums/w210-e-class/2608754-m104-oil-leak.html |title=M104 oil leak - Benzworld.org - Mercedes-Benz DIscussion Forum |publisher=Benzworld.org |date= |accessdate=24 May 2016}}</ref>\n\n'''Differential Bushing''' - The rear IRS differential bushing wears rapidly during high performance driving and cornering.{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}}\n\n'''Diesel injection distributor pump''' - The OM604 engines (E 200D and E 220D) were equipped with an electronically controlled injection pump from Lucas. The seals of the Lucas injection pumps become brittle over time and leak. The electromechanics have also been known to fail. Since the replacement of the entire injection pump is very expensive, a repair kit is offered in which the affected seals are replaced. Failed Lucas pumps are also commonly replaced with Bosch pumps from W124.\n\n== Model lineage ==\nThe W210 models replaced the [[Mercedes-Benz W124|W124]] E-Class models after 1995, launching in mainland Europe in September 1995 and in the United States on 8 November 1995. W210 sedans were replaced by the [[Mercedes-Benz W211|W211]] E-Class after 2002, and wagons/estates changed body style to the W211 after 2003.{{fact|date=October 2019}}\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20070210065400/http://www.eclassbenz.com/ EclassBenz.com]\n* [http://forums.mbworld.org/forums/forumdisplay.php?f=2 MBWorld.org W210 E-class Forum]\n* [http://www.benzworld.org/forums/forums/forum-view.asp?fid=17 Benzworld.org W210 E-class Forum]\n* [http://www.mbclub.co.uk/forums/index.php UK MBClub Forum]\n\n{{Mercedes-Benz vehicles}}\n{{Mercedes-Benz E-Class lineage}}\n\n[[Category:Mercedes-Benz model codes|W210]]\n[[Category:Mercedes-Benz vehicles|W210]]\n[[Category:Executive cars]]\n[[Category:Euro NCAP executive cars]]\n[[Category:Cars introduced in 1995]]\n[[Category:2000s cars]]\n[[Category:Limousines]]\n", "text_old": "{{Use dmy dates|date=January 2018}}\n{{Technical|date=January 2018}}\n{{Infobox automobile\n| name         = Mercedes-Benz W210 (1996-2003 models)\n| image        = 1999 Mercedes-Benz E 240 (W 210) Elegance sedan (2011-11-17) 01.jpg\n| manufacturer = {{ubl |[[Daimler-Benz]] (1996-1998) |[[DaimlerChrysler]] (1998-2003) |[[Magna Steyr]] (4MATIC models only)}}\n| production   = 17 July 1995\u2013March 2003\n| model_years  = {{ubl |1996-2002 (sedan) |1997-2003 (estate)}}\n| assembly     = {{ubl |Germany: |[[Bremen]] and [[Sindelfingen]] |Austria: |[[Graz]] (4 Matic only)<ref>{{cite web |title=210 series E-Class Estates, 1996 - 1999 |url=https://mercedes-benz-publicarchive.com/marsClassic/en/instance/ko/210-series-E-Class-Estates-1996---1999.xhtml?oid=5415 |website=marsClassic |accessdate=30 October 2019 |language=en}}</ref> |Egypt: [[6th of October City]] ([[Egyptian German Automotive Company|EGA]])<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.egasae.com/ |title=EGA |publisher=Egasae.com |date= |accessdate=1 October 2010}}</ref> |India: [[Pune]] ([[Tata Motors|TELCO]])<ref name=WOC>{{cite book | title = World of Cars 2006\u00b72007 | editor-first = Eligiusz | editor-last = Mazur | publisher = Media Connection Sp. z o.o. | location = Warsaw, Poland | page = 226 | year = 2006 | issn = 1734-2945 }}</ref> |Mexico: [[Santiago Tianguistenco]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.daimler.com/dccom/0-5-1380400-1-1346171-1-0-0-0-0-0-9506-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0.html|title=Santiago Tianguistenco, Truck Manufacturing Plant (Daimler Trucks North America LLC) - Daimler > Company > Daimler Worldwide > North and Central America|date=13 April 2015|work=daimler.com|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120909213357/http://www.daimler.com/dccom/0-5-1380400-1-1346171-1-0-0-0-0-0-9506-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0.html|archivedate=9 September 2012|df=dmy-all}}</ref>}}\n| predecessor = [[Mercedes-Benz W124]]\n| successor   = [[Mercedes-Benz W211]]\n| class       = [[Executive car]] ([[E-segment|E]])\n| engine      = [[Petrol engine|Petrol]]\n{{collapsible list|framestyle=border:none;

They were sold under the [[Mercedes-Benz E-Class|E-Class]] model names in both [[sedan (car)|sedan]] (saloon) and [[station wagon]] (estate) body types. W210 development started in 1988, three years after the [[W124]]'s introduction. The W210 E-class's appearance, which was designed by Steve Mattin under design chief [[Bruno Sacco]] between 1989 and 1991, heralded a new design idiom for Mercedes, which would continue until the [[Mercedes-Benz CLK-Class (C209)|W209 CLK]]. W210 design work was frozen in May 1992 and developed for a show vehicle by late 1992. This design was previewed on the 1993 Coup\u00e9 Concept shown at the [[Geneva Auto Show#1993|Geneva Auto Show]] in March 1993. Design patents for both the Coup\u00e9 Concept and the W210 E-Class were filed on 25 February 1993 in Germany and 25 August 1993 in the US.<ref>register.dpma.de/DPMAregister/gsm/register?GSNR=M9301492-0001</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.google.com/patents/USD354778|title=Patent USD354778 - Automobile body|work=google.com}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://register.dpma.de/DPMAregister/gsm/register?GSNR=M9301496-0001|title=DPMAregister - Designs - Registerauskunft zum Design|work=dpma.de}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://register.dpma.de/DPMAregister/gsm/register?GSNR=M9301493-0001|title=DPMAregister - Designs - Registerauskunft zum Design|work=dpma.de}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://register.dpma.de/DPMAregister/gsm/register?GSNR=M9301494-0001|title=DPMAregister - Designs - Registerauskunft zum Design|work=dpma.de}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://register.dpma.de/DPMAregister/gsm/register?GSNR=M9301495-0001|title=DPMAregister - Designs - Registerauskunft zum Design|work=dpma.de}}</ref>\n\nOn 21 July 1998, design patents were filed on an updated W210 (designed in 1997).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://register.dpma.de/DPMAregister/gsm/register?GSNR=49807266-0001|title=DPMAregister - Designs - Registerauskunft zum Design|work=dpma.de}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://register.dpma.de/DPMAregister/gsm/register?GSNR=49900461-0001|title=DPMAregister - Designs - Registerauskunft zum Design|work=dpma.de}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://register.dpma.de/DPMAregister/gsm/register?GSNR=49900461-0002|title=DPMAregister - Designs - Registerauskunft zum Design|work=dpma.de}}</ref> As a result, for the 2000 model year, a new multi-function information system was incorporated into the instrument cluster below the speedometer, and the introduction of steering wheel controls for the audio/navigation/phone system. In addition, the 5-speed [[automatic transmission]] introduced \"Touch Shift,\" which used the +/- gate positions for semi-manual control of the gearbox. This electronic system replaced the previous gated shift arrangement and simplified gear changes. Exterior changes included a revised front with a steeper rake, similar to the [[Mercedes-Benz CLK-Class (C208)|CLK]], and restyled bumpers and lower body trim; additionally, sedans received new taillights, while the wagon's tailgate was redesigned, moving the [[Automotive lighting#Centre high mount stop lamp (CHMSL)|CHMSL]] from the base of the rear window to directly above it in the underside of a small integral spoiler lip. The final W210 production included the E 320 and E 430 special editions released in two exterior colors - quartz silver (limited edition), obsidian black, and with Xenon lights, 17-inch alloy wheels and black maple walnut trim. Estate cars (sedans optionally) had Citroen-like self-leveling rear suspension with suspension struts rather than shock absorbers, gas-filled suspension spheres to provide damping and an under bonnet pressurizing pump. Unlike the traditional [[Citro\u00ebn]] application Mercedes opted for a fixed ride height and employed rear coil springs to maintain the static ride height when parked.\n\nIt was the first Mercedes-Benz production car featuring [[Xenon headlamp]]s (including dynamic headlamp range control, only low beam).<ref>http://media.daimler.com/dcmedia/0-921-656548-1-1761294-1-0-1-0-0-1-12639-0-0-1-0-0-0-0-0.html?TS=1420582847031 More light in every situation: Turning night into day</ref>\n\n== Engines ==\n{{Multiple image | align = right | direction = vertical | width =\n| image1 = 1999 Mercedes-Benz E 240 (W 210) Elegance sedan (2011-11-17) 02.jpg\n| caption1 = Sedan (pre-facelift)\n| image2 = 1997 Mercedes-Benz E 240 (S 210) Elegance station wagon (2011-03-10).jpg\n| caption2 = Wagon (pre-facelift)\n| image3 = W210 Avantgarde interieur.jpg\n| caption3 = Interior (pre-facelift)\n}}\n{{Multiple image | align = right | direction = vertical | width =\n| image1 = Mercedes-Benz E-Class W210.jpg\n| image2 = Mercedes E 270 CDI Elegance (W210 Facelift, 1999\u20132002) rear MJ.JPG\n| caption2 = Sedan (facelift)\n| image3 = Mercedes-Benz E320 wagon.jpg\n| caption3 = Wagon (facelift)\n| image4 = Innene.jpg\n| caption4 = Interior (facelift)\n}}\n\nThis was the first time a [[V6]] engine was offered (model year 1998) to replace the [[straight-six engine|straight-six]] configuration (1995\u20131997).

In 1999, Mercedes-Benz discontinued diesel powerplants in the E-class in North America. In Europe, the diesel engines were superseded by more advanced [[Common Rail]] (CDI) units (2000\u20132002).

In 1996, Mercedes installed in the E-class its electronically controlled model [[5G-Tronic|\"722.6\" five-speed automatic transmission]], a gearbox introduced in 1991 that was also available as an upgrade option in some of the six-cylinder W124 models. The 722.6 transmission is now used in a number of Daimler-Chrysler (Now Daimler only.) vehicles.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.marcusfitzhugh.com/CLK/DIY/transtypes.html |title=Mercedes Benz 722.6 transmission application guide |publisher=Marcusfitzhugh.com |date=9 November 1995 |accessdate=1 October 2010}}</ref>\n\nA five-speed manual is also available, although after the facelift in 1999, it was replaced by a six-speed [[manual transmission|manual]]. The 5-speed transmission was marketed as \"sealed for life\"; however, Mercedes dealers now recommend changing the fluid at regular intervals.\n\n== Wheels ==\nThe W210 chassis originally came with one of the following OEM [[wheel]] setups:\n* E 200/E 220 CDI/E 230/E 240(pre-facelift)/E 300 diesel: 15 x 6.5\" ET37\n* E 200 Kompressor/E 240/E 280/E 320/E 420: 16 x 7.5\" ET41\n* E 430: 16 x 7.5\" ET41 (before 2000); 17 x 7.5\" ET41 (after 2000)\n* Sport Package: 17 x 8\" ET37\n* Special Edition: 17 x 8\" ET35\n* E 55 AMG: 18 x 8\" ET31 front, 18 x 9\" ET35 rear.\nET is the German abbreviation for ''Einpresstiefe'' or [[Rim (wheel)#Production|offset]], where the number is in mm and indicates the amount of offset. This ETxx is stamped on the inside of OEM rims for easy reference.\n\nThe bolt pattern is 5x112 (12&nbsp;mm x 1.5 [[lug nut|lugs]]), with an offset range of 30\u201340&nbsp;mm, a wheel size range of 16\"x6.0\" to 20\"x8.5\". This is the same bolt pattern as most Mercedes, including the previous E-Class (W124). The newer Mercedes, including the 2003 (W211) to the present E-Class (W213), have 14&nbsp;mm ball seats, making the wheels interchangeable only with the use of aftermarket lugs that combine a 14 mm ball seat (also known as \"R14\", the \"R\" meaning radius) with a 12 mm thread.\n\n== AMG versions ==\n\nThere were four engines that AMG installed in the W210. The first was the E 36, M104.995, launched in 1996 for select markets then the M119.980 in the E 50 AMG produced from early 1996 until late 1997. This model was assembled in Affalterbach under the one man one engine philosophy, only available in left hand drive European markets although many were exported to Japan from new. It is estimated around 2,800 E 50\u2019s were ever produced in its limited production run. There was also an option for the M119.980 [[V8 engine|V8]] that was bored out to 6.0L and increased power to {{convert|381|PS|kW hp|abbr=on}} the cars these were fitted to were designated as the E 60 and came in sedan and wagon varieties. A limited edition 6.3L version, also badged E 60 AMG were built in 1996 generating {{convert|405|PS|kW hp|abbr=on}} and {{convert|454|ft.lbf|N.m|abbr=on}} of torque. In 1998 came the M113 powered E 55 which used a 5.4L [[V8 engine|V8]] SOHC 24V to produce {{convert|354|PS|kW hp|abbr=on}} and {{convert|391|ft.lbf|N.m|abbr=on}} of torque.\n\nThe body styling on all of the W210 AMG models was the same until 2000 when a facelift and interior upgrades were implemented. The W210 E 55 was the last vehicle for which a major portion of production took place at AMG in Affalterbach. Production was actually split between Affalterbach and the Bremen Mercedes Benz facility until the end of 2001.\n\n== Specifications (European and US versions) ==\n\n=== E 36 AMG ===\n\nThe rarest of all AMG models due to low productions numbers worldwide,{{Citation needed|date=September 2018}} the European-spec E 36 was produced from 1990 - 1993 W124 and 1996 - 1997 W210 and was not available in the US market.

Although this 4Matic system shares its name with the 90's 4MATIC system of the W124 300E, the system was totally redesigned and simplified. Rather than using the clutches and couplings of the earlier design, Mercedes opted to use three open differentials: front, center, and rear. The front suspension design of the 4Matic-equipped models is different to the rear wheel drive models and makes some replacement parts (such as shock absorbers) more expensive.\n\nThe E 55 AMG was available on request with 4Matic option, based on the driveline of the E 430.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Svendsen |first1=Jan Harry |title=E55 AMG 4Matic: Med grep om vinteren |url=https://www.dinside.no/motor/e55-amg-4matic-med-grep-om-vinteren/62866865 |website=DinSide.no |accessdate=30 October 2019 |language=no |date=24 November 1999}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=E 55 AMG 4MATIC station wagon |url=https://mercedes-benz-publicarchive.com/marsClassic/en/instance/ko/E-55-AMG-4MATIC-station-wagon.xhtml?oid=5412 |website=marsClassic |accessdate=30 October 2019 |language=en}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Der Maximal-E |url=https://www.autobild.de/artikel/mercedes-e-55-t-amg-4matic-34068.html |website=autobild.de |accessdate=30 October 2019}}</ref>\n\n== Reliability concerns ==\nSome known problems include the front spring perch has corroded and tearing away from the inner fender (wing), causing the front suspension to collapse. (4Matic models are not believed to be affected.) Other problems include defective harmonic balancer pulleys (recall), rust on trunk lid near latch, rust on Mercedes emblem on front hood, rust on door frames under window seals (recall), rust on front wings just above bumper, defective mass airflow meter, melted rear light bulb sockets, defective blower motor regulators, and rear window regulator failures.\n\n'''Harmonic Balancer''' - Some M112 and M113 engines used in W210 models were equipped with a [[Harmonic balancer|harmonic balancer pulley]] which, due to a supplier quality problem, may fail and cause engine damage. If the rubber insert of the harmonic balancer pulley delaminates, the pulley may grind through the timing chain cover and oil pan, causing several thousand dollars of damage. Mercedes-Benz USA issued Service Campaign #2005-020003<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.barringer1.com/jul04prb_files/Mercedes-Harmonic-Balancer-Recall.pdf |title=~m |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=1 October 2010}}</ref> which included inspection of the part and replacement if necessary at no cost. The part number on the harmonic balancer pulley can be compared to those given to Mercedes-Benz dealers in the Service Campaign notice<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.peachparts.com/shopforum/showthread.php?t=119790 |title=It's official. Harmonic Balancer Service Campaign released 4/5/05 - PeachParts Mercedes ShopForum |publisher=Peachparts.com |date= |accessdate=1 October 2010}}</ref> to determine if the part is a faulty original or has been replaced with the updated part. Replacement of the faulty part with the updated part should be a permanent solution to this problem.\n\n'''Blower Motor Regulator''' - If this part fails, the climate control fan will not operate faster than approximately 50% power. Mercedes updated the regulator to improve its reliability, but the redesigned regulator requires the installation of a new blower motor. The old-style regulator, which is compatible with the existing blower motor, is no longer manufactured. The blower motor regulator may be replaced with the much less expensive W140 S-class blower regulator, provided that the E-class wiring harness is re-attached to the S-class regulator.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mbworld.org/forums/e-class-w210/153918-early-w210-blower-motor-regulator-replacement-diy-here.html |title=Early W210 Blower Motor Regulator Replacement DIY Here... - MBWorld.org Forums |publisher=Mbworld.org |date= |accessdate=1 October 2010}}</ref>\n\n'''Front Sway Bar Drop Links''' - While not a serious concern, most E-classes end up with a sub {{convert|35|mi/h|km/h|abbr=on}} clicking or rattling sound from the front end. This is usually due to worn out front-end sway-bar drop links. These can easily be replaced by anybody with minor knowledge of vehicle DIY, for no more than around \u00a320.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.benzworld.org/forums/w210-e-class/1346654-photo-diy-swaybar-bushing-link-r.html |title=Photo DIY- SwayBar Bushing and Link R/R - Benzworld.org - Mercedes-Benz Discussion Forum |publisher=Benzworld.org |date= |accessdate=1 October 2010}}</ref>\n\n'''Front Spring Perches''' - Some owners have reported rust problems on the front spring perches - the top perches, which hold the tops of the springs for the front suspension. The perches are spot welded to the chassis, and factory coated in a weatherproof mastic to stop their rusting, however in some rare occurrences, water gets behind the mastic causing the perches to rust and eventually to fail - leading to collapse of the suspension. The car remains controllable. This is a problem that Mercedes USA have acknowledged. The problem is not identifiable without first removing the mastic to check.\n\n'''Body corrosion''' - Most model year versions of the W210 displayed body rust, notably on European-sold cars. Rust would sometimes appear spontaneously on panels such as doors and roofs on cars less than a year old. In response to this problem, the manufacturer would in some cases change or repair the affected panels under warranty or good will.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mbworld.org/forums/e-class-w210/69747-potential-rust-problem-all-w210-doors.html |title=Potential rust problem on all W210 doors!!! - MBWorld.org Forums |publisher=Mbworld.org |date= |accessdate=1 October 2010}}</ref> Mercedes-Benz has been criticized in the European press for not officially acknowledging this problem. This was due to problems introducing water-based paint technology within the German automobile industry, between the years 1998-2002.\n\n'''Window regulators''' - The power window regulator, essentially the mechanism that transfers power from the electric motor to the window, has a few plastic parts that can fail after several years causing the power window to stop operating.<ref>{{cite web|author=|url=http://www.benzworld.org/forums/w210-e-class/1226700-diy-pictorial-window-regulator-replacement.html |title=DIY pictorial window regulator replacement - Benzworld.org - Mercedes-Benz Discussion Forum |publisher=Benzworld.org |date= |accessdate=1 October 2010}}</ref>\n\n'''Cylinder Head Gasket''' - The cylinder head gasket on the M104 is known to fail, causing an oil leak at the rear of the cylinder head.<ref>{{cite web|author=|url=http://www.benzworld.org/forums/w210-e-class/2608754-m104-oil-leak.html |title=M104 oil leak - Benzworld.org - Mercedes-Benz DIscussion Forum |publisher=Benzworld.org |date= |accessdate=24 May 2016}}</ref>\n\n'''Differential Bushing''' - The rear IRS differential bushing wears rapidly during high performance driving and cornering.{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}}\n\n'''Diesel injection distributor pump''' - The OM604 engines (E 200D and E 220D) were equipped with an electronically controlled injection pump from Lucas. The seals of the Lucas injection pumps become brittle over time and leak. The electromechanics have also been known to fail. Since the replacement of the entire injection pump is very expensive, a repair kit is offered in which the affected seals are replaced. Failed Lucas pumps are also commonly replaced with Bosch pumps from W124.\n\n== Model lineage ==\nThe W210 models replaced the [[Mercedes-Benz W124|W124]] E-Class models after 1995, launching in mainland Europe in September 1995 and in the United States on 8 November 1995. W210 sedans were replaced by the [[Mercedes-Benz W211|W211]] E-Class after 2002, and wagons/estates changed body style to the W211 after 2003.{{fact|date=October 2019}}\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20070210065400/http://www.eclassbenz.com/ EclassBenz.com]\n* [http://forums.mbworld.org/forums/forumdisplay.php?f=2 MBWorld.org W210 E-class Forum]\n* [http://www.benzworld.org/forums/forums/forum-view.asp?fid=17 Benzworld.org W210 E-class Forum]\n* [http://www.mbclub.co.uk/forums/index.php UK MBClub Forum]\n\n{{Mercedes-Benz vehicles}}\n{{Mercedes-Benz E-Class lineage}}\n\n[[Category:Mercedes-Benz model codes|W210]]\n[[Category:Mercedes-Benz vehicles|W210]]\n[[Category:Executive cars]]\n[[Category:Euro NCAP executive cars]]\n[[Category:Cars introduced in 1995]]\n[[Category:2000s cars]]\n[[Category:Limousines]]\n", "name_user": "94.43.58.125", "label": "unsafe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mercedes-Benz_E-Class_(W210)"}
