His unusual life has taken him around the world to over 154 different cities in 18 different countries on 4 different continents.

It's always a great way to get rid of some stress before Monday begins.\" Just recently Jordan also became a certified [[Scuba diving|Scuba]] Diver.\nJordan is currently studying Mechanical Engineering at [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]].\n\n==Inline speed skating==\nJordan began [[inline speed skating]] in 1990 at the age of 5, and participated in his first international race in 1995. He made his first World Team in 2000, and turned professional the following year. In 2001, he earned the title of most decorated junior of all time, and in 2003 he was the fastest man in the world, winning the Senior World Championships.\n\nJordan left the sport of Inline with a total of 8 Junior and 6 Senior World Championship titles. He also competed on the Rollerblade, Inc. and Mogema WIC ([[World Inline Cup]]) Professional teams from 2001\u20132004.\n\nJordan credits his mother with enabling him to succeed in sports. Although she was not an athlete herself, Jordan says she taught him the life lessons he needed, including attention to detail. She also spent years driving Jordan to practices and meets, including a two-hour trip to [[Waco, Texas]] every weekend. She even had a hand in his training: Jordan said she had a moped, which she used to pace him while he skated behind her on inlines.\n\n===Injuries (Inline Speed Skating)===\nIn 2002, as an inline skater, Jordan was twice sidelined by significant injuries. First, while warming up at a meet, Jordan slipped and his left foot hit the boards and twisted, resulting in a spiral fracture. Jordan spent four months in a walking cast, during which he could only train by riding a bike or running in water.\n\nTwo weeks after returning, another freak accident left him hospitalized: Jordan tripped over a timing wire during a race, and went headfirst into the timing device that had no padding. When Jordan woke up in a hospital in [[Switzerland]], they told him he broke his upper jaw, lost four teeth, and had been convulsing during the 20 minutes it took to stabilize him at the scene. Jordan ended up with four plates and 16 screws in his head to keep his jaw in place.\n\nJordan momentarily considered quitting at that point. \"And then, 'What am I thinking?' No way am I done,\" Jordan said. \"This is what I love to do.\"\n\n==Short Track Speed Skating==\n\nSince his birth into the sport of Short Track Speed skating in 2004, Jordan has been the only skater to compete in all of the past 5 World Championships (2005\u20132009) for the US, making 2009 his 10th consecutive US World Championship including both Inline and Ice. He is the first skater (still the only male) to ever qualify for both Inline and Short Track World Teams, and he did so in consecutive years. In the past 5 years, he's achieved numerous World titles, including 6 World Championship medals (2009 Men's Relay GOLD). In 2007 he earned 7th overall at the ISU World Championships, and in 2008 was ranked 5th in the 1500m, and 6th in the 1000m ISU World Cup Overall classification.\n\n===Career highlights===\n2005 World Cup 6: Gold \u2013 Men's Relay\n<br />\n2005 World Championships: Bronze \u2013 Men's Relay\n<br />\n2006 World Championship: Bronze \u2013 Men's Relay\n<br />\n2006-07 World Cup Series: Bronze \u2013 Men's Relay (WC3); 1000m Silver (WC4); Gold \u2013 1000m (WC5); Gold \u2013 1500m (WC5); Bronze \u2013 1000m (WC6)\n<br />\n2007 World Championships: 1500m \u2013 4th overall; 500m \u2013 5th overall; 3000m \u2013 8th overall; Bronze \u2013 Men's Relay\n<br />\n2007-08 World Cup Series: Bronze \u2013 1000m (WC4); Bronze \u2013 1500m (WC4)\n<br />\n2008 World Team Championship: Gold\n<br />\n2008-09 World Cup Series: Silver \u2013 1000m (WC5)\n<br />\n2009 World Championships: Gold \u2013 Men's Relay\n<br />\n2009 World Team Championships \u2013 Bronze\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://www.sportresult.com/federations/ISU/ShortTrack/Bio.aspx?ath=6201 ISU profile]\n* {{USOPC profile|MA/Jordan-Malone}}\n* {{Official website|http://www.jordanmalone.com}}\n* {{Twitter}}\n* [http://www.facebook.com/profile.php?ref=sgm&id=653197905/ Jordan Malone] on Facebook\n* [http://www.facebook.com/profile.php?ref=sgm&id=653197905#!/pages/Jordan-Malone/299084645151?ref=ts/ Jordan Malone's Fan Page] on Facebook\n* [http://www.ustream.tv/channel/go-ahead-ask-me/ Jordan Malone] on UStream\n* [http://www.formspring.me/goaheadaskus/ Jordan Malone] on Formspring\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Malone, Jordan}}\n[[Category:1984 births]]\n[[Category:Living people]]\n[[Category:American male short track speed skaters]]\n[[Category:Olympic short track speed skaters of the United States]]\n[[Category:Olympic silver medalists for the United States in short track speed skating]]\n[[Category:Olympic bronze medalists for the United States in short track speed skating]]\n[[Category:Short track speed skaters at the 2010 Winter Olympics]]\n[[Category:Short track speed skaters at the 2014 Winter Olympics]]\n[[Category:Medalists at the 2010 Winter Olympics]]\n[[Category:Medalists at the 2014 Winter Olympics]]\n", "text_old": "{{short description|Short track speed skater}}\n{{Infobox speed skater\n| sport           = [[Short track speed skating]]\n| name            = Jordan Malone\n| image           = Shorttrack relay USA cropped.jpg\n| alt             = \n| caption         = Malone (#98) & [[Ryan Bedford]] (#94) in 2007\n| birth_date      = {{birth date and age|1984|4|20}}\n| birth_place     = [[Denton, Texas]]\n| height          = 5 ft 6 in\n| weight          = 145 lb\n| website         = {{URL|www.jordanmalone.com|JordanMalone.com}}\n| worldcup        = \n| worldchamp      = \n| country         = {{USA}}\n| club            = FAST Team\n| pb              = \n| medaltemplates  = \n{{MedalSport | Men's [[short track speed skating]] }}\n{{MedalCountry | the {{USA}} }}\n{{MedalCompetition | [[Olympic Games]] }}\n{{MedalSilver | [[2014 Winter Olympics|2014 Sochi]] | [[Short track speed skating at the 2014 Winter Olympics \u2013 Men's 5000 metre relay|5000&nbsp;m relay]] }}\n{{MedalBronze | [[2010 Winter Olympics|2010 Vancouver]] | [[Short track speed skating at the 2010 Winter Olympics \u2013 Men's 5000 metre relay|5000 m relay]] }}\n{{MedalCompetition | [[World Short Track Speed Skating Championships|World Championships]] }}\n{{MedalGold | [[2009 World Short Track Speed Skating Championships|2009 Vienna]] | 5000&nbsp;m  relay }}\n{{MedalSilver | [[2010 World Short Track Speed Skating Championships|2010 Sofia]] | 5000&nbsp;m  relay }}\n{{MedalCompetition | [[World Short Track Speed Skating Team Championships|World Team Championships]] }}\n{{MedalGold | [[2008 World Short Track Speed Skating Team Championships|2008 Harbin]] | Team }}\n{{MedalBronze | [[2009 World Short Track Speed Skating Team Championships|2009 Heerenveen]] | Team }}\n}}\n\n'''Jordan Malone''' (born April 20, 1984) is an American [[short track speed skating|short track speed skater]] who was a member of the [[United States at the 2010 Winter Olympics|US Olympic Team]] for the [[2010 Winter Olympics]] in [[Vancouver, British Columbia]].

{"title_page": "Triangle center", "text_new": "{{about|a geometry concept|the place in Lexington, Kentucky|Triangle Center}}\nIn [[geometry]], a '''triangle center''' (or '''triangle centre''') is a point in the plane that is in some sense a [[Centre (geometry)|center]] of a triangle akin to the centers of [[square (geometry)|squares]] and [[circle]]s, that is, a point that is in the middle of the figure by some measure. For example the [[centroid]], [[circumcenter]], [[incenter]] and [[orthocenter]] were familiar to the [[Greek mathematics|ancient Greeks]], and can be obtained by simple constructions.\n\nEach of these classical centers has the property that it is invariant (more precisely [[equivariant map|equivariant]]) under [[similarity (geometry)|similarity transformations]]. In other words, for any triangle and any similarity transformation (such as a [[rotation (mathematics)|rotation]], [[reflection (mathematics)|reflection]], [[dilation (metric space)|dilation]], or [[translation (geometry)|translation]]), the center of the transformed triangle is the same point as the transformed center of the original triangle.\nThis invariance is the defining property of a triangle center. It rules out other well-known points such as the [[Brocard points]] which are not invariant under reflection and so fail to qualify as triangle centers.\n\nAll centers of an [[equilateral triangle]] coincide at its centroid, but they generally differ from each other on [[scalene triangle]]s. The definitions and properties of thousands of triangle centers have been collected in the ''[[Encyclopedia of Triangle Centers]]''.\n\n==History==\nEven though the ancient Greeks discovered the classic centers of a triangle they had not formulated any definition of a triangle center. After the ancient Greeks, several special points associated with a triangle like the [[Fermat point]], [[nine-point center]], [[Lemoine point]], [[Gergonne point]], and [[Feuerbach point]] were discovered. During the revival of interest in triangle geometry in the 1980s it was noticed that these special points share some general properties that now form the basis for a formal definition of triangle center.<ref>List of classical and recent triangle centers: {{cite web|url=http://faculty.evansville.edu/ck6/tcenters/index.html|title=Triangle centers|accessdate=2009-05-23}}</ref><ref>Summary of ''Central Points and Central Lines in the Plane of a Triangle '' [http://www.math.hmc.edu/cgi-bin/mathsearch.cgi] (Accessed on 23 may 2009)</ref><ref>{{cite journal|doi=10.2307/2690608|last=Kimberling |first=Clark|year=1994|title=Central Points and Central Lines in the Plane of a Triangle|jstor=2690608 |journal=Mathematics Magazine|volume=67|issue=3|pages=163\u2013187}}</ref> {{As of|2019|6|20}}, [[Clark Kimberling]]'s ''[[Encyclopedia of Triangle Centers]]'' contains an annotated list of 32,784 triangle centers.<ref>[http://faculty.evansville.edu/ck6/encyclopedia/ETCPart17.html This is PART 17: Centers X(32001) - X(34000)]</ref>\n\n==Formal definition==\nA [[function (mathematics)|real-valued function]] ''f'' of three real variables ''a'', ''b'', ''c'' may have the following properties:\n*Homogeneity: ''f''(''ta'',''tb'',''tc'') = ''t''<sup>''n''</sup> ''f''(''a'',''b'',''c'') for some constant ''n'' and for all ''t'' > 0.\n*Bisymmetry in the second and third variables: ''f''(''a'',''b'',''c'') = ''f''(''a'',''c'',''b'').\nIf a non-zero ''f'' has both these properties it is called a '''triangle center function'''. If ''f'' is a triangle center function and ''a'', ''b'', ''c'' are the side-lengths of a reference triangle then the point whose [[trilinear coordinates]] are ''f''(''a'',''b'',''c'') : ''f''(''b'',''c'',''a'') : ''f''(''c'',''a'',''b'') is called a '''triangle center'''.\n\nThis definition ensures that triangle centers of similar triangles meet the invariance criteria specified above. By convention only the first of the three trilinear coordinates of a triangle center is quoted since the other two are obtained by [[cyclic permutation]] of ''a'', ''b'', ''c''. This process is known as '''cyclicity'''.<ref name=wolf1>{{cite web|url=http://mathworld.wolfram.com/TriangleCenter.html|title=Triangle Center|last=Weisstein|first=Eric W|author-link=Eric W. Weisstein|work=MathWorld\u2013A Wolfram Web Resource. |accessdate=25 May 2009}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://mathworld.wolfram.com/TriangleCenterFunction.html|title=Triangle Center Function|last=Weisstein|first=Eric W|work=MathWorld\u2013A Wolfram Web Resource. |accessdate=1 July 2009}}</ref>\n\nEvery triangle center function corresponds to a unique triangle center. This correspondence is not [[bijective]]. Different functions may define the same triangle center. For example the functions ''f''<sub>1</sub>(''a'',''b'',''c'') = 1/''a'' and ''f''<sub>2</sub>(''a'',''b'',''c'') = ''bc'' both correspond to the centroid.\nTwo triangle center functions define the same triangle center if and only if their ratio is a function symmetric in ''a'', ''b'' and ''c''.\n\nEven if a triangle center function is well-defined everywhere the same cannot always be said for its associated triangle center. For example let ''f''(''a'', ''b'', ''c'') be 0 if ''a''/''b'' and ''a''/''c'' are both rational and 1 otherwise. Then for any triangle with integer sides the associated triangle center evaluates to 0:0:0 which is undefined.\n\n===Default domain===\nIn some cases these functions are not defined on the whole of <span style=\"font-size:125%;\">\u211d</span><sup>3</sup>. For example the trilinears of ''X''<sub>365</sub> are ''a''<sup>1/2</sup> : ''b''<sup>1/2</sup> : ''c''<sup>1/2</sup> so ''a'', ''b'', ''c'' cannot be negative. Furthermore in order to represent the sides of a triangle they must satisfy the triangle inequality. So, in practice, every function's [[domain of a function|domain]] is restricted to the region of <span style=\"font-size:125%;\">\u211d</span><sup>3</sup> where ''a'' \u2264 ''b'' + ''c'', ''b'' \u2264 ''c'' + ''a'', and ''c'' \u2264 ''a'' + ''b''. This region '''T''' is the domain of all triangles, and it is the default domain for all triangle-based functions.\n\n===Other useful domains===\nThere are various instances where it may be desirable to restrict the analysis to a smaller domain than '''T'''. For example:\n\n:*The centers ''X''<sub>3</sub>, ''X''<sub>4</sub>, ''X''<sub>22</sub>, ''X''<sub>24</sub>, ''X''<sub>40</sub> make specific reference to [[acute triangle]]s, <br />namely that region of '''T''' where ''a''<sup>2</sup> \u2264 ''b''<sup>2</sup> + ''c''<sup>2</sup>, ''b''<sup>2</sup> \u2264 ''c''<sup>2</sup> + ''a''<sup>2</sup>, ''c''<sup>2</sup> \u2264 ''a''<sup>2</sup> + ''b''<sup>2</sup>.\n:*When differentiating between the Fermat point and ''X''<sub>13</sub> the domain of triangles with an angle exceeding 2\u03c0/3 is important, <br />in other words triangles for which ''a''<sup>2</sup> > ''b''<sup>2</sup> + ''bc'' + ''c''<sup>2</sup> or ''b''<sup>2</sup> > ''c''<sup>2</sup> + ''ca'' + ''a''<sup>2</sup> or ''c''<sup>2</sup> > ''a''<sup>2</sup> + ''ab'' + ''b''<sup>2</sup>.\n:*A domain of much practical value since it is dense in '''T''' yet excludes all trivial triangles (ie points) and degenerate triangles <br />(ie lines) is the set of all [[triangle|scalene]] triangles. It is obtained by removing the planes ''b'' = ''c'', ''c'' = ''a'', ''a'' = ''b'' from '''T'''.\n\n===Domain symmetry===\nNot every subset '''D''' \u2286 '''T''' is a viable domain. In order to support the bisymmetry test '''D''' must be symmetric about the planes ''b'' = ''c'', ''c'' = ''a'', ''a'' = ''b''. To support cyclicity it must also be invariant under 2\u03c0/3 rotations about the line ''a'' = ''b'' = ''c''. The simplest domain of all is the line (''t'',''t'',''t'') which corresponds to the set of all [[triangle|equilateral]] triangles.\n\n==Examples==\n[[Image:Trigonometric centres.png|right|thumb|400px|A triangle (\u0394''ABC'') with [[centroid]] (G), [[incenter]] (I), [[circumcenter]] (O), [[orthocenter]] (H) and [[nine-point circle|nine-point center]] (N)]]\n\n===Circumcenter===\nThe point of concurrence of the perpendicular bisectors of the sides of triangle ABC is the circumcenter. The trilinear coordinates of the circumcenter are\n\n:''a''(''b''<sup>2</sup> + ''c''<sup>2</sup> \u2212 ''a''<sup>2</sup>) : ''b''(''c''<sup>2</sup> + ''a''<sup>2</sup> \u2212 ''b''<sup>2</sup>) : ''c''(''a''<sup>2</sup> + ''b''<sup>2</sup> \u2212 ''c''<sup>2</sup>).\n\nLet ''f''(''a'',''b'',''c'') = ''a''(''b''<sup>2</sup> + ''c''<sup>2</sup> \u2212 ''a''<sup>2</sup>). Then\n:''f''(''ta'',''tb'',''tc'') = (''ta'') ( (''tb'')<sup>2</sup> + (''tc'')<sup>2</sup> \u2212 (''ta'')<sup>2</sup> ) = ''t''<sup>3</sup> ( ''a''( ''b''<sup>2</sup> + ''c''<sup>2</sup> \u2212 ''a''<sup>2</sup>) ) = ''t''<sup>3</sup> ''f''(''a'',''b'',''c'') (homogeneity)\n:''f''(''a'',''c'',''b'') = ''a''(''c''<sup>2</sup> + ''b''<sup>2</sup> \u2212 ''a''<sup>2</sup>) = ''a''(''b''<sup>2</sup> + ''c''<sup>2</sup> \u2212 ''a''<sup>2</sup>) = ''f''(''a'',''b'',''c'') (bisymmetry)\nso f is a triangle center function. Since the corresponding triangle center has the same trilinears as the circumcenter it follows that the circumcenter is a triangle center.\n\n===1st isogonic center===\nLet A'BC be the equilateral triangle having base BC and vertex A' on the negative side of BC and let AB'C and ABC' be similarly constructed equilateral triangles based on the other two sides of triangle ABC. Then the lines AA', BB' and CC' are concurrent and the point of concurrence is the 1st isogonal center. Its trilinear coordinates are\n\n:csc(A + \u03c0/3) : csc(B + \u03c0/3) : csc(C + \u03c0/3).\n\nExpressing these coordinates in terms of ''a'', ''b'' and ''c'', one can verify that they indeed satisfy the defining properties of the coordinates of a triangle center. Hence the 1st isogonic center is also a triangle center.\n\n===Fermat point===\nLet\n\n:<math>f(a, b, c) = \\begin{cases}\n  1 & \\quad \\text{if } a^2 > b^2 + bc + c^2 & (\\text{equivalently } A > 2\\pi/3), \\\\\n  0 & \\quad \\text{if } b^2 > c^2 + ca + a^2 \\text{ or } c^2 > a^2 + ab + b^2 & (\\text{equivalently } B > 2\\pi/3 \\text{ or } C > 2\\pi/3), \\\\\n    \\csc(A + \\pi/3) & \\quad \\text{otherwise } & (\\text{equivalently no vertex angle exceeds } 2\\pi/3).\n\\end{cases}</math>\n\nThen ''f'' is bisymmetric and homogeneous so it is a triangle center function. Moreover the corresponding triangle center coincides with the obtuse angled vertex whenever any vertex angle exceeds 2\u03c0/3, and with the 1st isogonic center otherwise. Therefore this triangle center is none other than the [[Fermat point]].\n\n==Non-examples==\n\n===Brocard points===\nThe trilinear coordinates of the first Brocard point are ''c''/''b'' : ''a''/''c'' : ''b''/''a''. These coordinates satisfy the properties of homogeneity and cyclicity but not bisymmetry. So the first Brocard point is not (in general) a triangle center. The second Brocard point has trilinear coordinates ''b''/''c'' : ''c''/''a'' : ''a''/''b'' and similar remarks apply.\n\nThe first and second Brocard points are one of many bicentric pairs of points,<ref>[http://faculty.evansville.edu/ck6/encyclopedia/BicentricPairs.html Bicentric Pairs of Points], Encyclopedia of Triangle Centers, accessed 2012-05-02</ref> pairs of points defined from a triangle with the property that the pair (but not each individual point) is preserved under similarities of the triangle. Several binary operations, such as midpoint and trilinear product, when applied to the two Brocard points, as well as other bicentric pairs, produce triangle centers.\n\n==Position Vectors==\nTriangle centers can be written as following \n\n:<math>P=\\frac{w_A A + w_B B + w_C C} {w_A + w_B + w_C}.</math>\n\nHere,  <math>P,A,B,C</math> are position vectors, and, coordinates <math>w_A, w_B, w_C</math> are scalars whose definition corresponds each center instances can be seen in the following table, where, <math>a, b, c</math> are side lengths, and, <math>S</math> is area of the triangle that Heron's formula can be utilized to get. \n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=text-align:center;\n|-\n! |  \n! | <math>w_A</math>\n! | <math>w_B</math>\n! | <math>w_C</math>\n! | <math>w_A+w_B+w_C</math>\n|-\n|Incenter \n| style=\"text-align:center;\"| <math>a</math>\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"| <math>b</math>\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"| <math>c</math>\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"| <math> a+b+c</math>\n|-\n|rowspan=\"3\"|Excenter\n| style=\"text-align:center;\" | <math>-a</math>\n| style=\"text-align:center;\" | <math>b</math>\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"| <math>c</math>\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"| <math>b+c-a </math>\n|-  \n| style=\"text-align:center;\"| <math>a</math>\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"| <math>-b</math>\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"| <math>c</math>\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"| <math>c+a-b</math>\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"| <math>a</math>\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"| <math>b</math>\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"| <math>-c</math>\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"| <math>a+b-c</math>\n|-\n|Centroid \n| style=\"text-align:center;\"| <math>1</math>\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"| <math>1</math>\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"| <math>1</math>\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"| <math>3</math>\n|-\n|Circumcenter\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"| <math>a^2(b^2 + c^2 - a^2)</math>\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"| <math>b^2(c^2 + a^2 - b^2) </math>\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"| <math>c^2(a^2 + b^2 - c^2)</math>\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"| <math>16S^2</math>\n|-\n|Orthocenter\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"| <math>a^4 - (b^2 - c^2)^2</math>\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"| <math>b^4 - (c^2 - a^2)^2</math>\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"| <math>c^4 - (a^2 - b^2)^2</math>\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"| <math>16S^2</math>\n|}\n\n:<math>a\\equiv\\overline{BC}=\\sqrt{(\\vec{BC},\\vec{BC})},</math>\n:<math>b\\equiv\\overline{CA}=\\sqrt{(\\vec{CA},\\vec{CA})},</math>\n:<math>c\\equiv\\overline{AB}=\\sqrt{(\\vec{AB},\\vec{AB})},</math>\n:<math>16S^2=(a^2 + b^2+c^2)^2-2(a^4 + b^4+c^4).</math>\n\n==Some well-known triangle centers==\n\n===Classical triangle centers===\n<center>\n{| class=\"wikitable\" border=\"1\"\n!

If two sides of a triangle are equal &nbsp;(say ''a'' = ''b'')&nbsp; then\n{{Equation|1=f(a,b,c) = f(b,a,c)|2=since ''a'' = ''b''}}\n{{Equation|1= \\quad\\quad\\quad\\quad= f(b,c,a)|2= by bisymmetry}}\nso two components of the associated triangle center are always equal. Therefore all triangle centers of an isosceles triangle must lie on its line of symmetry. For an equilateral triangle all three components are equal so all centers coincide with the centroid. So, like a circle, an equilateral triangle has a unique center.\n\n===Excenters===\nLet\n\n:<math>f(a, b, c) = \\begin{cases}\n  -1 & \\quad \\text{if } a \\ge b \\text{ and } a \\ge c, \\\\\n   \\;\\;\\; 1 & \\quad \\text{otherwise}.\n\\end{cases}</math>\n\nThis is readily seen to be a triangle center function and (provided the triangle is scalene) the corresponding triangle center is the excenter opposite to the largest vertex angle. The other two excenters can be picked out by similar functions. However as indicated above only one of the excenters of an isosceles triangle and none of the excenters of an equilateral triangle can ever be a triangle center.\n\n===Biantisymmetric functions===\nA function ''f'' is '''biantisymmetric''' if ''f''(''a'',''b'',''c'') = \u2212''f''(''a'',''c'',''b'') for all ''a'',''b'',''c''. If such a function is also non-zero and homogeneous it is easily seen that the mapping (a,b,c) \u2192 ''f''(''a'',''b'',''c'')<sup>2</sup> ''f''(''b'',''c'',''a'') ''f''(''c'',''a'',''b'') is a triangle center function. The corresponding triangle center is ''f''(''a'',''b'',''c'') : ''f''(''b'',''c'',''a'') : ''f''(''c'',''a'',''b''). On account of this the definition of triangle center function is sometimes taken to include non-zero homogeneous biantisymmetric functions.\n\n===New centers from old===\nAny triangle center function ''f'' can be '''normalized''' by multiplying it by a symmetric function of ''a'',''b'',''c'' so that ''n'' = 0. A normalized triangle center function has the same triangle center as the original, and also the stronger property that ''f''(''ta'',''tb'',''tc'') = ''f''(''a'',''b'',''c'') for all ''t'' > 0 and all (''a'',''b'',''c''). Together with the zero function, normalized triangle center functions form an [[algebra over a field|algebra]] under addition, subtraction, and multiplication. This gives an easy way to create new triangle centers. However distinct normalized triangle center functions will often define the same triangle center, for example ''f'' and (''abc'')<sup>\u22121</sup>(''a''+''b''+''c'')<sup>3</sup>''f'' .\n\n===Uninteresting centers===\nAssume ''a'',''b'',''c'' are real variables and let \u03b1,\u03b2,\u03b3 be any three real constants. Let\n\n:<math>f(a, b, c) = \\begin{cases}\n  \\alpha & \\quad \\text{ if } a < b \\text{ and } a < c \\quad \\text{(equivalently the first variable is the smallest)}, \\\\\n  \\gamma & \\quad \\text{ if } a > b \\text{ and } a > c \\quad \\text{(equivalently the first variable is the largest)}, \\\\\n  \\beta & \\quad \\; \\text{otherwise} \\quad \\; \\quad \\quad \\, \\quad \\text{(equivalently the first variable is in the middle)}.\n\\end{cases}</math>\n\nThen ''f'' is a triangle center function and \u03b1 : \u03b2 : \u03b3 is the corresponding triangle center whenever the sides of the reference triangle are labelled so that ''a'' < ''b'' < ''c''. Thus every point is potentially a triangle center. However the vast majority of triangle centers are of little interest, just as most continuous functions are of little interest. The [[Encyclopedia of Triangle Centers]] is an ever-expanding list of interesting ones.\n\n===Barycentric coordinates===\nIf ''f'' is a triangle center function then so is ''af'' and the corresponding triangle center is ''af''(''a'',''b'',''c'') : ''bf''(''b'',''c'',''a'') : ''cf''(''c'',''a'',''b''). Since these are precisely the [[Barycentric coordinate system|barycentric coordinates]] of the triangle center corresponding to ''f'' it follows that triangle centers could equally well have been defined in terms of barycentrics instead of trilinears. In practice it isn't difficult to switch from one coordinate system to the other.\n\n===Binary systems===\nThere are other center pairs besides the Fermat point and the 1st isogonic center. Another system is formed by ''X''<sub>3</sub> and the incenter of the tangential triangle. Consider the triangle center function given by:\n\n:<math>f(a, b, c) = \\begin{cases}\n  \\cos(A) \\quad \\; \\quad \\; \\quad \\; \\quad \\; \\quad \\; \\quad \\;\\,\\, \\text{if the triangle is acute}, \\\\\n  \\cos(A) + \\sec(B)\\sec(C) \\quad \\text{if the vertex angle at } A \\text{ is obtuse}, \\\\\n  \\cos(A) - \\sec(A) \\quad \\; \\quad \\; \\quad \\;\\, \\text{if either of the angles at } B \\text{ or } C \\text{ is obtuse}.\n\\end{cases}</math>\n\nFor the corresponding triangle center there are four distinct possibilities:\n:*&nbsp; cos(''A'') : cos(''B'') : cos(''C'') &nbsp; &nbsp; if the reference triangle is acute (this is also the circumcenter).\n:*&nbsp; [cos(''A'') + sec(''B'')sec(''C'')] : [cos(''B'') \u2212 sec(''B'')] : [cos(''C'') \u2212 sec(''C'')] &nbsp; &nbsp; if the angle at ''A'' is obtuse.\n:*&nbsp; [cos(''A'') \u2212 sec(''A'')] : [cos(''B'') + sec(''C'')sec(''A'')] : [cos(''C'') \u2212 sec(''C'')] &nbsp; &nbsp; if the angle at ''B'' is obtuse.\n:*&nbsp; [cos(''A'') \u2212 sec(''A'')] : [cos(''B'') \u2212 sec(''B'')] : [cos(''C'') + sec(''A'')sec(''B'')] &nbsp; &nbsp; if the angle at ''C'' is obtuse.\nRoutine calculation shows that in every case these trilinears represent the incenter of the tangential triangle. So this point is a triangle center that is a close companion of the circumcenter.\n\n===Bisymmetry and invariance===\nReflecting a triangle reverses the order of its sides. In the image the coordinates refer to the (''c'',''b'',''a'') triangle and (using \"|\" as the separator) the reflection of an arbitrary point \u03b1 : \u03b2 : \u03b3 is \u03b3 | \u03b2 | \u03b1. If ''f'' is a triangle center function the reflection of its triangle center is ''f''(''c'',''a'',''b'') | ''f''(''b'',''c'',''a'') | ''f''(''a'',''b'',''c'') which, by bisymmetry, is the same as ''f''(''c'',''b'',''a'') | ''f''(''b'',''a'',''c'') | ''f''(''a'',''c'',''b''). As this is also the triangle center corresponding to ''f'' relative to the (''c'',''b'',''a'') triangle, bisymmetry ensures that all triangle centers are invariant under reflection. Since rotations and translations may be regarded as double reflections they too must preserve triangle centers. These invariance properties provide justification for the definition.\n\n===Alternative terminology===\nSome other names for dilation are [[scaling (geometry)|uniform scaling]], [[scaling (geometry)|isotropic scaling]], [[homothetic transformation|homothety]], and [[homothetic transformation|homothecy]].\n\n==Hyperbolic triangle centers==\n\nThe study of triangle centers traditionally is concerned with [[Euclidean geometry]], but triangle centers can also be studied in [[hyperbolic geometry]]. Using [[gyrotrigonometry]], expressions for trigonometric barycentric coordinates can be calculated that have the same form for both Euclidean and hyperbolic geometry. In order for the expressions to coincide, the expressions must ''not'' encapsulate the specification of the angle sum being 180 degrees.<ref>[http://ajmaa.org/searchroot/files/pdf/v6n1/v6i1p18.pdf Hyperbolic Barycentric Coordinates],\nAbraham A.

For example the [[centroid]], [[circumcenter]], [[incenter]] and [[orthocenter]] were familiar to the [[Greek mathematics|ancient Greeks]], and can be obtained by simple constructions.\n\nEach of these classical centers has the property that it is invariant (more precisely [[equivariant map|equivariant]]) under [[similarity (geometry)|similarity transformations]]. In other words, for any triangle and any similarity transformation (such as a [[rotation (mathematics)|rotation]], [[reflection (mathematics)|reflection]], [[dilation (metric space)|dilation]], or [[translation (geometry)|translation]]), the center of the transformed triangle is the same point as the transformed center of the original triangle.\nThis invariance is the defining property of a triangle center. It rules out other well-known points such as the [[Brocard points]] which are not invariant under reflection and so fail to qualify as triangle centers.\n\nAll centers of an [[equilateral triangle]] coincide at its centroid, but they generally differ from each other on [[scalene triangle]]s. The definitions and properties of thousands of triangle centers have been collected in the ''[[Encyclopedia of Triangle Centers]]''.\n\n==History==\nEven though the ancient Greeks discovered the classic centers of a triangle they had not formulated any definition of a triangle center. After the ancient Greeks, several special points associated with a triangle like the [[Fermat point]], [[nine-point center]], [[Lemoine point]], [[Gergonne point]], and [[Feuerbach point]] were discovered. During the revival of interest in triangle geometry in the 1980s it was noticed that these special points share some general properties that now form the basis for a formal definition of triangle center.<ref>List of classical and recent triangle centers: {{cite web|url=http://faculty.evansville.edu/ck6/tcenters/index.html|title=Triangle centers|accessdate=2009-05-23}}</ref><ref>Summary of ''Central Points and Central Lines in the Plane of a Triangle '' [http://www.math.hmc.edu/cgi-bin/mathsearch.cgi] (Accessed on 23 may 2009)</ref><ref>{{cite journal|doi=10.2307/2690608|last=Kimberling |first=Clark|year=1994|title=Central Points and Central Lines in the Plane of a Triangle|jstor=2690608 |journal=Mathematics Magazine|volume=67|issue=3|pages=163\u2013187}}</ref> {{As of|2019|6|20}}, [[Clark Kimberling]]'s ''[[Encyclopedia of Triangle Centers]]'' contains an annotated list of 32,784 triangle centers.<ref>[http://faculty.evansville.edu/ck6/encyclopedia/ETCPart17.html This is PART 17: Centers X(32001) - X(34000)]</ref>\n\n==Formal definition==\nA [[function (mathematics)|real-valued function]] ''f'' of three real variables ''a'', ''b'', ''c'' may have the following properties:\n*Homogeneity: ''f''(''ta'',''tb'',''tc'') = ''t''<sup>''n''</sup> ''f''(''a'',''b'',''c'') for some constant ''n'' and for all ''t'' > 0.\n*Bisymmetry in the second and third variables: ''f''(''a'',''b'',''c'') = ''f''(''a'',''c'',''b'').\nIf a non-zero ''f'' has both these properties it is called a '''triangle center function'''. If ''f'' is a triangle center function and ''a'', ''b'', ''c'' are the side-lengths of a reference triangle then the point whose [[trilinear coordinates]] are ''f''(''a'',''b'',''c'') : ''f''(''b'',''c'',''a'') : ''f''(''c'',''a'',''b'') is called a '''triangle center'''.\n\nThis definition ensures that triangle centers of similar triangles meet the invariance criteria specified above. By convention only the first of the three trilinear coordinates of a triangle center is quoted since the other two are obtained by [[cyclic permutation]] of ''a'', ''b'', ''c''. This process is known as '''cyclicity'''.<ref name=wolf1>{{cite web|url=http://mathworld.wolfram.com/TriangleCenter.html|title=Triangle Center|last=Weisstein|first=Eric W|author-link=Eric W. Weisstein|work=MathWorld\u2013A Wolfram Web Resource. |accessdate=25 May 2009}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://mathworld.wolfram.com/TriangleCenterFunction.html|title=Triangle Center Function|last=Weisstein|first=Eric W|work=MathWorld\u2013A Wolfram Web Resource. |accessdate=1 July 2009}}</ref>\n\nEvery triangle center function corresponds to a unique triangle center. This correspondence is not [[bijective]]. Different functions may define the same triangle center. For example the functions ''f''<sub>1</sub>(''a'',''b'',''c'') = 1/''a'' and ''f''<sub>2</sub>(''a'',''b'',''c'') = ''bc'' both correspond to the centroid.\nTwo triangle center functions define the same triangle center if and only if their ratio is a function symmetric in ''a'', ''b'' and ''c''.\n\nEven if a triangle center function is well-defined everywhere the same cannot always be said for its associated triangle center. For example let ''f''(''a'', ''b'', ''c'') be 0 if ''a''/''b'' and ''a''/''c'' are both rational and 1 otherwise. Then for any triangle with integer sides the associated triangle center evaluates to 0:0:0 which is undefined.\n\n===Default domain===\nIn some cases these functions are not defined on the whole of <span style=\"font-size:125%;\">\u211d</span><sup>3</sup>. For example the trilinears of ''X''<sub>365</sub> are ''a''<sup>1/2</sup> : ''b''<sup>1/2</sup> : ''c''<sup>1/2</sup> so ''a'', ''b'', ''c'' cannot be negative. Furthermore in order to represent the sides of a triangle they must satisfy the triangle inequality. So, in practice, every function's [[domain (mathematics)|domain]] is restricted to the region of <span style=\"font-size:125%;\">\u211d</span><sup>3</sup> where ''a'' \u2264 ''b'' + ''c'', ''b'' \u2264 ''c'' + ''a'', and ''c'' \u2264 ''a'' + ''b''. This region '''T''' is the domain of all triangles, and it is the default domain for all triangle-based functions.\n\n===Other useful domains===\nThere are various instances where it may be desirable to restrict the analysis to a smaller domain than '''T'''. For example:\n\n:*The centers ''X''<sub>3</sub>, ''X''<sub>4</sub>, ''X''<sub>22</sub>, ''X''<sub>24</sub>, ''X''<sub>40</sub> make specific reference to [[acute triangle]]s, <br />namely that region of '''T''' where ''a''<sup>2</sup> \u2264 ''b''<sup>2</sup> + ''c''<sup>2</sup>, ''b''<sup>2</sup> \u2264 ''c''<sup>2</sup> + ''a''<sup>2</sup>, ''c''<sup>2</sup> \u2264 ''a''<sup>2</sup> + ''b''<sup>2</sup>.\n:*When differentiating between the Fermat point and ''X''<sub>13</sub> the domain of triangles with an angle exceeding 2\u03c0/3 is important, <br />in other words triangles for which ''a''<sup>2</sup> > ''b''<sup>2</sup> + ''bc'' + ''c''<sup>2</sup> or ''b''<sup>2</sup> > ''c''<sup>2</sup> + ''ca'' + ''a''<sup>2</sup> or ''c''<sup>2</sup> > ''a''<sup>2</sup> + ''ab'' + ''b''<sup>2</sup>.\n:*A domain of much practical value since it is dense in '''T''' yet excludes all trivial triangles (ie points) and degenerate triangles <br />(ie lines) is the set of all [[triangle|scalene]] triangles. It is obtained by removing the planes ''b'' = ''c'', ''c'' = ''a'', ''a'' = ''b'' from '''T'''.\n\n===Domain symmetry===\nNot every subset '''D''' \u2286 '''T''' is a viable domain. In order to support the bisymmetry test '''D''' must be symmetric about the planes ''b'' = ''c'', ''c'' = ''a'', ''a'' = ''b''. To support cyclicity it must also be invariant under 2\u03c0/3 rotations about the line ''a'' = ''b'' = ''c''. The simplest domain of all is the line (''t'',''t'',''t'') which corresponds to the set of all [[triangle|equilateral]] triangles.\n\n==Examples==\n[[Image:Trigonometric centres.png|right|thumb|400px|A triangle (\u0394''ABC'') with [[centroid]] (G), [[incenter]] (I), [[circumcenter]] (O), [[orthocenter]] (H) and [[nine-point circle|nine-point center]] (N)]]\n\n===Circumcenter===\nThe point of concurrence of the perpendicular bisectors of the sides of triangle ABC is the circumcenter. The trilinear coordinates of the circumcenter are\n\n:''a''(''b''<sup>2</sup> + ''c''<sup>2</sup> \u2212 ''a''<sup>2</sup>) : ''b''(''c''<sup>2</sup> + ''a''<sup>2</sup> \u2212 ''b''<sup>2</sup>) : ''c''(''a''<sup>2</sup> + ''b''<sup>2</sup> \u2212 ''c''<sup>2</sup>).\n\nLet ''f''(''a'',''b'',''c'') = ''a''(''b''<sup>2</sup> + ''c''<sup>2</sup> \u2212 ''a''<sup>2</sup>). Then\n:''f''(''ta'',''tb'',''tc'') = (''ta'') ( (''tb'')<sup>2</sup> + (''tc'')<sup>2</sup> \u2212 (''ta'')<sup>2</sup> ) = ''t''<sup>3</sup> ( ''a''( ''b''<sup>2</sup> + ''c''<sup>2</sup> \u2212 ''a''<sup>2</sup>) ) = ''t''<sup>3</sup> ''f''(''a'',''b'',''c'') (homogeneity)\n:''f''(''a'',''c'',''b'') = ''a''(''c''<sup>2</sup> + ''b''<sup>2</sup> \u2212 ''a''<sup>2</sup>) = ''a''(''b''<sup>2</sup> + ''c''<sup>2</sup> \u2212 ''a''<sup>2</sup>) = ''f''(''a'',''b'',''c'') (bisymmetry)\nso f is a triangle center function. Since the corresponding triangle center has the same trilinears as the circumcenter it follows that the circumcenter is a triangle center.\n\n===1st isogonic center===\nLet A'BC be the equilateral triangle having base BC and vertex A' on the negative side of BC and let AB'C and ABC' be similarly constructed equilateral triangles based on the other two sides of triangle ABC. Then the lines AA', BB' and CC' are concurrent and the point of concurrence is the 1st isogonal center. Its trilinear coordinates are\n\n:csc(A + \u03c0/3) : csc(B + \u03c0/3) : csc(C + \u03c0/3).\n\nExpressing these coordinates in terms of ''a'', ''b'' and ''c'', one can verify that they indeed satisfy the defining properties of the coordinates of a triangle center. Hence the 1st isogonic center is also a triangle center.\n\n===Fermat point===\nLet\n\n:<math>f(a, b, c) = \\begin{cases}\n  1 & \\quad \\text{if } a^2 > b^2 + bc + c^2 & (\\text{equivalently } A > 2\\pi/3), \\\\\n  0 & \\quad \\text{if } b^2 > c^2 + ca + a^2 \\text{ or } c^2 > a^2 + ab + b^2 & (\\text{equivalently } B > 2\\pi/3 \\text{ or } C > 2\\pi/3), \\\\\n    \\csc(A + \\pi/3) & \\quad \\text{otherwise } & (\\text{equivalently no vertex angle exceeds } 2\\pi/3).\n\\end{cases}</math>\n\nThen ''f'' is bisymmetric and homogeneous so it is a triangle center function. Moreover the corresponding triangle center coincides with the obtuse angled vertex whenever any vertex angle exceeds 2\u03c0/3, and with the 1st isogonic center otherwise. Therefore this triangle center is none other than the [[Fermat point]].\n\n==Non-examples==\n\n===Brocard points===\nThe trilinear coordinates of the first Brocard point are ''c''/''b'' : ''a''/''c'' : ''b''/''a''. These coordinates satisfy the properties of homogeneity and cyclicity but not bisymmetry. So the first Brocard point is not (in general) a triangle center. The second Brocard point has trilinear coordinates ''b''/''c'' : ''c''/''a'' : ''a''/''b'' and similar remarks apply.\n\nThe first and second Brocard points are one of many bicentric pairs of points,<ref>[http://faculty.evansville.edu/ck6/encyclopedia/BicentricPairs.html Bicentric Pairs of Points], Encyclopedia of Triangle Centers, accessed 2012-05-02</ref> pairs of points defined from a triangle with the property that the pair (but not each individual point) is preserved under similarities of the triangle. Several binary operations, such as midpoint and trilinear product, when applied to the two Brocard points, as well as other bicentric pairs, produce triangle centers.\n\n==Position Vectors==\nTriangle centers can be written as following \n\n:<math>P=\\frac{w_A A + w_B B + w_C C} {w_A + w_B + w_C}.</math>\n\nHere,  <math>P,A,B,C</math> are position vectors, and, coordinates <math>w_A, w_B, w_C</math> are scalars whose definition corresponds each center instances can be seen in the following table, where, <math>a, b, c</math> are side lengths, and, <math>S</math> is area of the triangle that Heron's formula can be utilized to get. \n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=text-align:center;\n|-\n! |  \n! | <math>w_A</math>\n! | <math>w_B</math>\n! | <math>w_C</math>\n! | <math>w_A+w_B+w_C</math>\n|-\n|Incenter \n| style=\"text-align:center;\"| <math>a</math>\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"| <math>b</math>\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"| <math>c</math>\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"| <math> a+b+c</math>\n|-\n|rowspan=\"3\"|Excenter\n| style=\"text-align:center;\" | <math>-a</math>\n| style=\"text-align:center;\" | <math>b</math>\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"| <math>c</math>\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"| <math>b+c-a </math>\n|-  \n| style=\"text-align:center;\"| <math>a</math>\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"| <math>-b</math>\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"| <math>c</math>\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"| <math>c+a-b</math>\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"| <math>a</math>\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"| <math>b</math>\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"| <math>-c</math>\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"| <math>a+b-c</math>\n|-\n|Centroid \n| style=\"text-align:center;\"| <math>1</math>\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"| <math>1</math>\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"| <math>1</math>\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"| <math>3</math>\n|-\n|Circumcenter\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"| <math>a^2(b^2 + c^2 - a^2)</math>\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"| <math>b^2(c^2 + a^2 - b^2) </math>\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"| <math>c^2(a^2 + b^2 - c^2)</math>\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"| <math>16S^2</math>\n|-\n|Orthocenter\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"| <math>a^4 - (b^2 - c^2)^2</math>\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"| <math>b^4 - (c^2 - a^2)^2</math>\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"| <math>c^4 - (a^2 - b^2)^2</math>\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"| <math>16S^2</math>\n|}\n\n:<math>a\\equiv\\overline{BC}=\\sqrt{(\\vec{BC},\\vec{BC})},</math>\n:<math>b\\equiv\\overline{CA}=\\sqrt{(\\vec{CA},\\vec{CA})},</math>\n:<math>c\\equiv\\overline{AB}=\\sqrt{(\\vec{AB},\\vec{AB})},</math>\n:<math>16S^2=(a^2 + b^2+c^2)^2-2(a^4 + b^4+c^4).</math>\n\n==Some well-known triangle centers==\n\n===Classical triangle centers===\n<center>\n{| class=\"wikitable\" border=\"1\"\n!

If two sides of a triangle are equal &nbsp;(say ''a'' = ''b'')&nbsp; then\n{{Equation|1=f(a,b,c) = f(b,a,c)|2=since ''a'' = ''b''}}\n{{Equation|1= \\quad\\quad\\quad\\quad= f(b,c,a)|2= by bisymmetry}}\nso two components of the associated triangle center are always equal. Therefore all triangle centers of an isosceles triangle must lie on its line of symmetry. For an equilateral triangle all three components are equal so all centers coincide with the centroid. So, like a circle, an equilateral triangle has a unique center.\n\n===Excenters===\nLet\n\n:<math>f(a, b, c) = \\begin{cases}\n  -1 & \\quad \\text{if } a \\ge b \\text{ and } a \\ge c, \\\\\n   \\;\\;\\; 1 & \\quad \\text{otherwise}.\n\\end{cases}</math>\n\nThis is readily seen to be a triangle center function and (provided the triangle is scalene) the corresponding triangle center is the excenter opposite to the largest vertex angle. The other two excenters can be picked out by similar functions. However as indicated above only one of the excenters of an isosceles triangle and none of the excenters of an equilateral triangle can ever be a triangle center.\n\n===Biantisymmetric functions===\nA function ''f'' is '''biantisymmetric''' if ''f''(''a'',''b'',''c'') = \u2212''f''(''a'',''c'',''b'') for all ''a'',''b'',''c''. If such a function is also non-zero and homogeneous it is easily seen that the mapping (a,b,c) \u2192 ''f''(''a'',''b'',''c'')<sup>2</sup> ''f''(''b'',''c'',''a'') ''f''(''c'',''a'',''b'') is a triangle center function. The corresponding triangle center is ''f''(''a'',''b'',''c'') : ''f''(''b'',''c'',''a'') : ''f''(''c'',''a'',''b''). On account of this the definition of triangle center function is sometimes taken to include non-zero homogeneous biantisymmetric functions.\n\n===New centers from old===\nAny triangle center function ''f'' can be '''normalized''' by multiplying it by a symmetric function of ''a'',''b'',''c'' so that ''n'' = 0. A normalized triangle center function has the same triangle center as the original, and also the stronger property that ''f''(''ta'',''tb'',''tc'') = ''f''(''a'',''b'',''c'') for all ''t'' > 0 and all (''a'',''b'',''c''). Together with the zero function, normalized triangle center functions form an [[algebra over a field|algebra]] under addition, subtraction, and multiplication. This gives an easy way to create new triangle centers. However distinct normalized triangle center functions will often define the same triangle center, for example ''f'' and (''abc'')<sup>\u22121</sup>(''a''+''b''+''c'')<sup>3</sup>''f'' .\n\n===Uninteresting centers===\nAssume ''a'',''b'',''c'' are real variables and let \u03b1,\u03b2,\u03b3 be any three real constants. Let\n\n:<math>f(a, b, c) = \\begin{cases}\n  \\alpha & \\quad \\text{ if } a < b \\text{ and } a < c \\quad \\text{(equivalently the first variable is the smallest)}, \\\\\n  \\gamma & \\quad \\text{ if } a > b \\text{ and } a > c \\quad \\text{(equivalently the first variable is the largest)}, \\\\\n  \\beta & \\quad \\; \\text{otherwise} \\quad \\; \\quad \\quad \\, \\quad \\text{(equivalently the first variable is in the middle)}.\n\\end{cases}</math>\n\nThen ''f'' is a triangle center function and \u03b1 : \u03b2 : \u03b3 is the corresponding triangle center whenever the sides of the reference triangle are labelled so that ''a'' < ''b'' < ''c''. Thus every point is potentially a triangle center. However the vast majority of triangle centers are of little interest, just as most continuous functions are of little interest. The [[Encyclopedia of Triangle Centers]] is an ever-expanding list of interesting ones.\n\n===Barycentric coordinates===\nIf ''f'' is a triangle center function then so is ''af'' and the corresponding triangle center is ''af''(''a'',''b'',''c'') : ''bf''(''b'',''c'',''a'') : ''cf''(''c'',''a'',''b''). Since these are precisely the [[Barycentric coordinate system|barycentric coordinates]] of the triangle center corresponding to ''f'' it follows that triangle centers could equally well have been defined in terms of barycentrics instead of trilinears. In practice it isn't difficult to switch from one coordinate system to the other.\n\n===Binary systems===\nThere are other center pairs besides the Fermat point and the 1st isogonic center. Another system is formed by ''X''<sub>3</sub> and the incenter of the tangential triangle. Consider the triangle center function given by:\n\n:<math>f(a, b, c) = \\begin{cases}\n  \\cos(A) \\quad \\; \\quad \\; \\quad \\; \\quad \\; \\quad \\; \\quad \\;\\,\\, \\text{if the triangle is acute}, \\\\\n  \\cos(A) + \\sec(B)\\sec(C) \\quad \\text{if the vertex angle at } A \\text{ is obtuse}, \\\\\n  \\cos(A) - \\sec(A) \\quad \\; \\quad \\; \\quad \\;\\, \\text{if either of the angles at } B \\text{ or } C \\text{ is obtuse}.\n\\end{cases}</math>\n\nFor the corresponding triangle center there are four distinct possibilities:\n:*&nbsp; cos(''A'') : cos(''B'') : cos(''C'') &nbsp; &nbsp; if the reference triangle is acute (this is also the circumcenter).\n:*&nbsp; [cos(''A'') + sec(''B'')sec(''C'')] : [cos(''B'') \u2212 sec(''B'')] : [cos(''C'') \u2212 sec(''C'')] &nbsp; &nbsp; if the angle at ''A'' is obtuse.\n:*&nbsp; [cos(''A'') \u2212 sec(''A'')] : [cos(''B'') + sec(''C'')sec(''A'')] : [cos(''C'') \u2212 sec(''C'')] &nbsp; &nbsp; if the angle at ''B'' is obtuse.\n:*&nbsp; [cos(''A'') \u2212 sec(''A'')] : [cos(''B'') \u2212 sec(''B'')] : [cos(''C'') + sec(''A'')sec(''B'')] &nbsp; &nbsp; if the angle at ''C'' is obtuse.\nRoutine calculation shows that in every case these trilinears represent the incenter of the tangential triangle. So this point is a triangle center that is a close companion of the circumcenter.\n\n===Bisymmetry and invariance===\nReflecting a triangle reverses the order of its sides. In the image the coordinates refer to the (''c'',''b'',''a'') triangle and (using \"|\" as the separator) the reflection of an arbitrary point \u03b1 : \u03b2 : \u03b3 is \u03b3 | \u03b2 | \u03b1. If ''f'' is a triangle center function the reflection of its triangle center is ''f''(''c'',''a'',''b'') | ''f''(''b'',''c'',''a'') | ''f''(''a'',''b'',''c'') which, by bisymmetry, is the same as ''f''(''c'',''b'',''a'') | ''f''(''b'',''a'',''c'') | ''f''(''a'',''c'',''b''). As this is also the triangle center corresponding to ''f'' relative to the (''c'',''b'',''a'') triangle, bisymmetry ensures that all triangle centers are invariant under reflection. Since rotations and translations may be regarded as double reflections they too must preserve triangle centers. These invariance properties provide justification for the definition.\n\n===Alternative terminology===\nSome other names for dilation are [[scaling (geometry)|uniform scaling]], [[scaling (geometry)|isotropic scaling]], [[homothetic transformation|homothety]], and [[homothetic transformation|homothecy]].\n\n==Hyperbolic triangle centers==\n\nThe study of triangle centers traditionally is concerned with [[Euclidean geometry]], but triangle centers can also be studied in [[hyperbolic geometry]]. Using [[gyrotrigonometry]], expressions for trigonometric barycentric coordinates can be calculated that have the same form for both Euclidean and hyperbolic geometry. In order for the expressions to coincide, the expressions must ''not'' encapsulate the specification of the angle sum being 180 degrees.<ref>[http://ajmaa.org/searchroot/files/pdf/v6n1/v6i1p18.pdf Hyperbolic Barycentric Coordinates],\nAbraham A.

Not only did the Lyon & Healy company often change designs to follow the rapidly evolving consumer demand, but the company also repaired instruments, and offered engraving services, including decorating instruments that it retailed but did not actually manufacture. As well, they built instruments for other retailers and distributors under various [[store brand|house brands]], and [[Outsourcing|outsourced construction]] of some models.\n\nIn 1912, Washburn introduced the Lakeside Jumbo guitar, which some consider the first dreadnought-sized guitar.<ref>\n{{cite book\n | author    = John Teagle | first = U.S. Music Corp.\n | year      = 1996\n | title     = Washburn, Over One Hundred Years of Fine Stringed Instruments\n | edition   = 1st\n | publisher = Amsco Publications | location = New York\n | isbn      = 0-8256-1435-X\n | page      = 73\n}}\n</ref> It bridged the gap between smaller-bodied \"parlor\" guitars of the late 19th and early 20th century and modern-day [[Steel-string acoustic guitar#Types|dreadnought and jumbo]] acoustic guitars.\n\n{{multiple image |align=left |direction=horizontal |width=135\n | image1   = Washburn Shrine banjos at the American Banjo Museum.jpg\n | caption1 = Washburn ''Shrine'' banjos at the [[American Banjo Museum]]\n | image2   = Washburn Presentation Banjo (Lyon & Healy) 1894, American Banjo Museum.jpg\n | caption2 = Washburn ''Presentation Banjo'', 1894, American Banjo Museum.\n}}\nGeorge Lyon retired from the company in 1889 (died 1894). Patrick Healy then led the company into a period of major expansion, beginning with a larger new factory and improved mass-production techniques, and soon dominated the domestic market.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Bacon|first1=Tony|title=The history of the American guitar: 1833 to the present day|date=1 September 2001|publisher=Hal Leonard|isbn=9781617130335|edition=1st}}</ref> Their 1892 catalog claimed to manufacture 100,000 instruments annually. Healy died 1905.\n\nBy the 1920s, Lyon & Healy faced growing competition from other instrument manufacturers as well as from the rise of other forms of entertainment, particularly [[movie theater|film]] and [[Sound recording and reproduction#Disc phonograph|the gramophone]]. Lyon & Healy gradually shifted manufacturing chores onto wholesaler Tonk Brothers, to whom they sold the guitar portion of the business in 1928, continuing to produce their own lines of harps, pianos, and organs.\n\nTonk Brothers turned to manufacturer J.R. Stewart Company to purchase and operate the massive factory, but this transition proved problematic and Stewart went bankrupt in 1930. Some of the Stewart assets were acquired by the [[Regal Musical Instrument Company]], which had purchased the \"Regal\" brand name in 1908 from Lyon & Healy (who acquired it in 1905). Regal was chosen to reopen the Washburn factory (producing Regal instruments as well). Though the Washburn brand was preserved, it never regained its preeminence, and by the early 1940s had declined to nothing.\n\n===Modern era===\nAn unbroken lineage is often alluded to by Washburn International, in press releases and advertising materials, and on the company website:\n{{quote|''Washburn has been building stringed instruments since 1883. \u2026 130 years of history is at the root of our strong foundation building high quality instruments.<ref>''http://www.washburn.com/community/'' \"The History of Washburn Guitars\"</ref>''}}\nThere is no direct connection between the original Washburn brand and the modern Washburn International.\n\nIn the early 1960s, retail store '''The Chicago Guitar Gallery''' hired '''Rudolf \"Rudy\" Schlacher''', a young German [[Luthier|violin builder]], as a repair technician. A few years later, Schlacher opened '''The Sound Post'''<ref>''[https://www.namm.org/library/oral-history/rudy-schlacher]'', heading of \"Rudy Schlacher\" video in [[NAMM]] Oral History video project.</ref><ref>''[http://grandpianohaus.com/about/mission \"Grand Piano Haus: The history of Grand Piano Haus\"]''</ref> (in Evanston, Illinois) to focus on guitars. He soon realized the sales potential for lower-cost quality instruments.\n\nTom Beckmen and his wife Judy Fink Beckmen in 1972 left careers as music salesman and teacher (respectively) to launch a wholesale music business in Los Angeles, Beckmen Musical Instruments. It was Beckmen Music that resurrected the Washburn name, and beginning in 1974 applied it to a series of quality imported acoustic guitars, made in Japan by Terada, as well as a selection of mandolins and banjos.\n\nSchlacher and Rick Johnstone, as '''Fretted Industries, Inc.''', acquired the Washburn name in 1977 (for $13,000) when the Beckmens took their business a different direction,<ref>''[https://www.beckmenvineyards.com/our-story]:Beckmen Music became [[Roland Corporation|Roland]]'s distributor for the western United States in 1976, and in 1978 a 50% partner in founding '''Roland USA'''. The Beckmens sold their share back to Roland in 1993 and bought a vineyard in the Santa Ynez Valley.</ref> and so the Washburn name was returned to Chicago. With assistance from [[Ikutaro Kakehashi]] (founder of [[Roland Corporation]]), Schlacher was able to find instrument factories in Japan that could meet the desired standards.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Di Perna|first1=Alan|title=Burning for you|url=https://www.infomusic.pl/images/PDF/WASHBURN_GW7-09.pdf|accessdate=7 March 2017|work=Guitar World|date=July 2009}}</ref>\n\nFretted Industries acquired other lines as well, such as [[Oscar Schmidt Inc.|Oscar Schmidt]] [[autoharp]]s.\n\nSchlacher bought out Johnstone in 1987, and changed the company name to '''Washburn International'''. A stateside manufacturing operation was opened in 1991 for higher-end, short-run, and one-off instruments, as well as development and prototyping. That year, a ''[[Chicago Tribune]]'' article<ref>''[http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1991-02-17/business/9101150609_1_guitars-acoustic-stringed \"Guitar-maker Strikes Comeback Chord: Washburn Hits The Top 3 On 15 Years Of Growth\"], February 17, 1991''</ref> confidently places Washburn \"among the top three guitar manufacturers in the world,\" behind only [[Fender Musical Instruments Corporation|Fender]] and [[Gibson]].\n\nOn December 15, 2002, Washburn International announced that it had completed acquisition of [[U.S. Music Corporation]],<ref>''[http://www.hoovers.com/company-information/cs/company-profile.US_Music_Corp.90f14f8af048ab4b.html] Hoovers.com, entry: U.S. MUSIC CORPORATION Company Profile''</ref> and would be rolling its assets into that company in a [[Reverse takeover|reverse merger]].<ref>''[http://www.usmusiccorp.com/pr/usm.htm  U.S. Music press release]'', 12/15/2002</ref> Schlacher remained as [[CFO]], appointing '''Gary Gryczan''' to [[Chief operating officer|COO]]; Gryczan had been Washburn's CFO from 1995 through 1998. The new USM's headquarters were in [[Mundelein, Illinois|Mundelein]] (440 E. Courtland Street), which also housed the stateside Washburn [[luthier]]y, often referred to as \"the USA Custom Shop.\" The USA Custom Shop was previously located at Elston Ave. and Springfield Ave in the 1990s in an old factory that was used as an icehouse after the great Chicago fire, it was rumored to be haunted by the victims whose bodies had been stored there. \n\nSchlacher announced completion of selling USM to '''JAM Industries''' on August 24, 2009, and that he would be stepping away from his company after fully four decades.<ref>''[http://www.musicincmag.com/News/2009/090813/090813_usmc2.html \"Schlacher Says Farewell\"]''</ref> {{quote|''We are pleased to join forces with a strategic partner like Jam Industries, that has a long, successful history in the music industry and has been a long-term business partner with U.S. Music for more than 20 years.

It has relied on outside factories and luthiers to fulfill their designs and meet public demand.\n\nThe first modern Washburn instruments were full-size acoustic guitars imported from Japan by Beckmen Music. The 1974 range included one folk-style guitar (W-200) and eight dreadnoughts of increasing quality and decoration: W-240-12, W-250, W-260, W-280, W-300, W-300-12, W-500, W-600.\n\nUnder Rudy Schlacher, most Washburn models were ordered in runs of 200 units, rather than ongoing production; if sales went well, a further run might be ordered. This application of [[just-in-time manufacturing]] (or [[lean manufacturing]]) kept the company from needing to warehouse and liquidate overproduction, improving profitability. As a result, many Washburn instruments (acoustic or electric) are difficult to locate once out of production, and are scarcer than the \"limited editions\" of other manufacturers.\n\nThe first Washburn electric guitars were the Wing Series models, offered 1978-1984. These instruments featured innovative push-pull split humbuckers, brass hardware and inlays, and [[neck-through]] construction.  Most of the Wing Series models were produced by Yamaki, a Japanese manufacturer of Washburn acoustic guitars as well as their own Daion brand (late 1970s to early 1980s).\n\nBy 1991, production of Washburn instruments had shifted almost entirely to Korea, built by [[Samick]]. When Samick opened their [[Cileungsi]], Indonesia, facility in 1992, this factory also began to produce Washburn-branded instruments, generally identifiable by an \"SI-\" serial number prefix.\n\nFrom 1992 to 2000 Washburn housed the USA Custom Shop in a factory at Elston Ave. and Springfield Ave. Grover Jackson ran production for the first half of the 90\u2019s and Larry English ran production for the second half of the 90\u2019s. The building was so old it was used as an icehouse after the great Chicago fire and rumored to have been haunted. At least two guitar heists occurred there when thieves backed a box truck through a wall and loaded the truck with guitars getting away cleanly. \n\nBetween 1994 and 2001, ten models of acoustic guitar were built for Washburn in the United States, five by [[Tacoma Guitars]] (Tacoma, Washington) and five by [[Dana Bourgeois|Bourgeois Guitars]] (Lewiston, Maine).\n\nWashburn brought out a line of four USA-made dreadnoughts, available from 2002 to 2008. These were the D-78, D-80, D-82, and D-84. (All had the \"-SW\" suffix, for \"solid wood,\" indicating that no laminate wood was employed.)\n<!-- trivia: The J-14 (1998) and J-15 (1998-1999) archtops were among the highest-priced Washburn guitars ever made. -->\n\nIn 2012, when JAM Industries declined to renew the lease on the Mundelein facility, the Washburn luthiery closed. At the time, the Washburn facility was the ninth-largest employer in the village (the third-largest business), providing 180 jobs.<ref>[http://www.ci.douglasville.ga.us/DocumentCenter/Home/View/2073 Village of Mundelein 2011 Comprehensive Annual Financial Report]</ref> The stated intent was to reopen at a smaller building in Buffalo Grove (1000 Corporate Grove Drive)<ref>''[https://web.archive.org/web/20170308141152/https://www.highbeam.com/doc/1N1-13D4019E304C9408.html]'', Guitar maker leaves Mundelein.</ref> but this did not materialize. A few Washburn models (particularly the N4) are produced in Cincinnati.\n\nAs of 2017, primary production has largely shifted from Korea to factories in Indonesia and China.\n\n==Innovations==\nMost widely known for its guitars (both [[electric guitar|electric]] and [[acoustic guitar|acoustic]]), Washburn also makes [[electric bass]]es, [[acoustic bass guitar|acoustic basses]], [[banjo]]s, [[mandolin]]s, [[Silent guitar|travel guitar]]s, [[ukulele]]s, and [[amplifier]]s, as well as accessories including guitar cases, clothing, [[Electronic tuner|tuner]]s, and straps.<ref>\n{{cite web\n | title     = Washburn History<!-- Bot generated title -->\n | url       = http://www.washburn.com/community/\n | publisher = Washburn Guitars / U.S. Music Corp., a division of JAM Industries, LTD.\n}}</ref>\n\nIn the 1980s, Washburn introduced the '''Festival Series''' of acoustic/electric guitars (the EA series, for \"electrified acoustic\"). They were thinner than standard acoustic guitars and less acoustically resonant by design, thereby reducing susceptibility to [[audio feedback|feedback]], a significant problem using acoustic or electrified acoustic guitars in large-venue performances. The addition in later models of sound slots (rather than the traditional round soundhole), a patented innovation,  further reduced the possibility of feedback, and the guitars quickly became the go-to stage acoustic for artists such as [[Jimmy Page]], [[George Harrison]], and [[Bob Dylan]]. In the early 1990s when [[MTV]] introduced their [[MTV Unplugged|Unplugged]] series, hardly a show went by without seeing a Festival Series guitar. The design also lent itself well to acoustic basses, and Washburn's AB Series quickly became popular both for its look and its tone, whether amplified or unplugged.\n\n[[File:Washburn RB2802 8-String Bass headstock with Buzz Feiten tuning system.jpg|thumb|right|[[Headstock]] of a Washburn RB2802 eight-string bass.]]\n\nIn recent years, Washburn licensed several guitar construction features:\n* ''the [[Buzz Feiten]] Tuning System'' &mdash; a corrected-temperation tuning formula, using a compensated nut and saddle to minimize the inherent [[Intonation (music)|intonation]] problems of the Western tuning formula.

Additional letters may be used to indicate the instrument's finish. While imperfectly applied, and sometimes awkwardly long, this can often be useful in identifying a given guitar.\n;suffix \u2014\n* C - cutaway\n* DL - deluxe (generally, a standard model with a few upgraded features)\n* E - electric (i.e., built-in pickup)\n* K - kit (i.e., includes case or gig bag)\n* LH - left-handed\n* M - mahogany top\n* Q - quilt maple top\n* R - rosewood\n* S - solid-wood top (rather than laminate)\n* SP - spalt maple top\n* SW - solid wood used throughout\n* V - vibrato (on electric guitars)\nThis often combines with the prefix to tell a guitar's story. For example, the WLG110SWCEK indicates that it's part of the Woodline series (WL-), likely top of the line (110), Grand Auditorium (G) size, all solid wood, cutaway, piezo pickup, and originally included a case.\n\n== Past and present models ==\nAny given series may have as few as only one model.\n\n=== Electric guitars ===\n{{multiple image |align=right |direction=horizontal |width=150\n | image1   = Washburn WG587.jpg\n | caption1 = WG587 7-string guitar.\n | image2   = Washburn N4 Special 20 1.jpg\n | caption2 = N4 Special\n}}\n{{multiple image |align=right |direction=horizontal\n | image1   = Washburn_hb35.jpg|width1=150\n | caption1 = HB35.\n | image2   = Washburn J5 Jazz Guitar.jpg|width2=150\n | caption2 = J5 Jazz guitar.\n}}\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n! prefix\n!

Not only did the Lyon & Healy company often change designs to follow the rapidly evolving consumer demand, but the company also repaired instruments, and offered engraving services, including decorating instruments that it retailed but did not actually manufacture. As well, they built instruments for other retailers and distributors under various [[store brand|house brands]], and [[Outsourcing|outsourced construction]] of some models.\n\nIn 1912, Washburn introduced the Lakeside Jumbo guitar, which some consider the first dreadnought-sized guitar.<ref>\n{{cite book\n | author    = John Teagle | first = U.S. Music Corp.\n | year      = 1996\n | title     = Washburn, Over One Hundred Years of Fine Stringed Instruments\n | edition   = 1st\n | publisher = Amsco Publications | location = New York\n | isbn      = 0-8256-1435-X\n | page      = 73\n}}\n</ref> It bridged the gap between smaller-bodied \"parlor\" guitars of the late 19th and early 20th century and modern-day [[Steel-string acoustic guitar#Types|dreadnought and jumbo]] acoustic guitars.\n\n{{multiple image |align=left |direction=horizontal |width=135\n | image1   = Washburn Shrine banjos at the American Banjo Museum.jpg\n | caption1 = Washburn ''Shrine'' banjos at the [[American Banjo Museum]]\n | image2   = Washburn Presentation Banjo (Lyon & Healy) 1894, American Banjo Museum.jpg\n | caption2 = Washburn ''Presentation Banjo'', 1894, American Banjo Museum.\n}}\nGeorge Lyon retired from the company in 1889 (died 1894). Patrick Healy then led the company into a period of major expansion, beginning with a larger new factory and improved mass-production techniques, and soon dominated the domestic market.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Bacon|first1=Tony|title=The history of the American guitar: 1833 to the present day|date=1 September 2001|publisher=Hal Leonard|isbn=9781617130335|edition=1st}}</ref> Their 1892 catalog claimed to manufacture 100,000 instruments annually. Healy died 1905.\n\nBy the 1920s, Lyon & Healy faced growing competition from other instrument manufacturers as well as from the rise of other forms of entertainment, particularly [[movie theater|film]] and [[Sound recording and reproduction#Disc phonograph|the gramophone]]. Lyon & Healy gradually shifted manufacturing chores onto wholesaler Tonk Brothers, to whom they sold the guitar portion of the business in 1928, continuing to produce their own lines of harps, pianos, and organs.\n\nTonk Brothers turned to manufacturer J.R. Stewart Company to purchase and operate the massive factory, but this transition proved problematic and Stewart went bankrupt in 1930. Some of the Stewart assets were acquired by the [[Regal Musical Instrument Company]], which had purchased the \"Regal\" brand name in 1908 from Lyon & Healy (who acquired it in 1905). Regal was chosen to reopen the Washburn factory (producing Regal instruments as well). Though the Washburn brand was preserved, it never regained its preeminence, and by the early 1940s had declined to nothing.\n\n===Modern era===\nAn unbroken lineage is often alluded to by Washburn International, in press releases and advertising materials, and on the company website:\n{{quote|''Washburn has been building stringed instruments since 1883. \u2026 130 years of history is at the root of our strong foundation building high quality instruments.<ref>''http://www.washburn.com/community/'' \"The History of Washburn Guitars\"</ref>''}}\nThere is no direct connection between the original Washburn brand and the modern Washburn International.\n\nIn the early 1960s, retail store '''The Chicago Guitar Gallery''' hired '''Rudolf \"Rudy\" Schlacher''', a young German [[Luthier|violin builder]], as a repair technician. A few years later, Schlacher opened '''The Sound Post'''<ref>''[https://www.namm.org/library/oral-history/rudy-schlacher]'', heading of \"Rudy Schlacher\" video in [[NAMM]] Oral History video project.</ref><ref>''[http://grandpianohaus.com/about/mission \"Grand Piano Haus: The history of Grand Piano Haus\"]''</ref> (in Evanston, Illinois) to focus on guitars. He soon realized the sales potential for lower-cost quality instruments.\n\nTom Beckmen and his wife Judy Fink Beckmen in 1972 left careers as music salesman and teacher (respectively) to launch a wholesale music business in Los Angeles, Beckmen Musical Instruments. It was Beckmen Music that resurrected the Washburn name, and beginning in 1974 applied it to a series of quality imported acoustic guitars, made in Japan by Terada, as well as a selection of mandolins and banjos.\n\nSchlacher and Rick Johnstone, as '''Fretted Industries, Inc.''', acquired the Washburn name in 1977 (for $13,000) when the Beckmens took their business a different direction,<ref>''[https://www.beckmenvineyards.com/our-story]:Beckmen Music became [[Roland Corporation|Roland]]'s distributor for the western United States in 1976, and in 1978 a 50% partner in founding '''Roland USA'''. The Beckmens sold their share back to Roland in 1993 and bought a vineyard in the Santa Ynez Valley.</ref> and so the Washburn name was returned to Chicago. With assistance from [[Ikutaro Kakehashi]] (founder of [[Roland Corporation]]), Schlacher was able to find instrument factories in Japan that could meet the desired standards.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Di Perna|first1=Alan|title=Burning for you|url=https://www.infomusic.pl/images/PDF/WASHBURN_GW7-09.pdf|accessdate=7 March 2017|work=Guitar World|date=July 2009}}</ref>\n\nFretted Industries acquired other lines as well, such as [[Oscar Schmidt Inc.|Oscar Schmidt]] [[autoharp]]s.\n\nSchlacher bought out Johnstone in 1987, and changed the company name to '''Washburn International'''. A stateside manufacturing operation was opened in 1991 for higher-end, short-run, and one-off instruments, as well as development and prototyping. That year, a ''[[Chicago Tribune]]'' article<ref>''[http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1991-02-17/business/9101150609_1_guitars-acoustic-stringed \"Guitar-maker Strikes Comeback Chord: Washburn Hits The Top 3 On 15 Years Of Growth\"], February 17, 1991''</ref> confidently places Washburn \"among the top three guitar manufacturers in the world,\" behind only [[Fender Musical Instruments Corporation|Fender]] and [[Gibson Guitar Corporation|Gibson]].\n\nOn December 15, 2002, Washburn International announced that it had completed acquisition of [[U.S. Music Corporation]],<ref>''[http://www.hoovers.com/company-information/cs/company-profile.US_Music_Corp.90f14f8af048ab4b.html] Hoovers.com, entry: U.S. MUSIC CORPORATION Company Profile''</ref> and would be rolling its assets into that company in a [[Reverse takeover|reverse merger]].<ref>''[http://www.usmusiccorp.com/pr/usm.htm  U.S. Music press release]'', 12/15/2002</ref> Schlacher remained as [[CFO]], appointing '''Gary Gryczan''' to [[Chief operating officer|COO]]; Gryczan had been Washburn's CFO from 1995 through 1998. The new USM's headquarters were in [[Mundelein, Illinois|Mundelein]] (440 E. Courtland Street), which also housed the stateside Washburn [[luthier]]y, often referred to as \"the USA Custom Shop.\" The USA Custom Shop was previously located at Elston Ave. and Springfield Ave in the 1990s in an old factory that was used as an icehouse after the great Chicago fire, it was rumored to be haunted by the victims whose bodies had been stored there. \n\nSchlacher announced completion of selling USM to '''JAM Industries''' on August 24, 2009, and that he would be stepping away from his company after fully four decades.<ref>''[http://www.musicincmag.com/News/2009/090813/090813_usmc2.html \"Schlacher Says Farewell\"]''</ref> {{quote|''We are pleased to join forces with a strategic partner like Jam Industries, that has a long, successful history in the music industry and has been a long-term business partner with U.S. Music for more than 20 years.

It has relied on outside factories and luthiers to fulfill their designs and meet public demand.\n\nThe first modern Washburn instruments were full-size acoustic guitars imported from Japan by Beckmen Music. The 1974 range included one folk-style guitar (W-200) and eight dreadnoughts of increasing quality and decoration: W-240-12, W-250, W-260, W-280, W-300, W-300-12, W-500, W-600.\n\nUnder Rudy Schlacher, most Washburn models were ordered in runs of 200 units, rather than ongoing production; if sales went well, a further run might be ordered. This application of [[just-in-time manufacturing]] (or [[lean manufacturing]]) kept the company from needing to warehouse and liquidate overproduction, improving profitability. As a result, many Washburn instruments (acoustic or electric) are difficult to locate once out of production, and are scarcer than the \"limited editions\" of other manufacturers.\n\nThe first Washburn electric guitars were the Wing Series models, offered 1978-1984. These instruments featured innovative push-pull split humbuckers, brass hardware and inlays, and [[neck-through]] construction.  Most of the Wing Series models were produced by Yamaki, a Japanese manufacturer of Washburn acoustic guitars as well as their own Daion brand (late 1970s to early 1980s).\n\nBy 1991, production of Washburn instruments had shifted almost entirely to Korea, built by [[Samick]]. When Samick opened their [[Cileungsi]], Indonesia, facility in 1992, this factory also began to produce Washburn-branded instruments, generally identifiable by an \"SI-\" serial number prefix.\n\nFrom 1992 to 2000 Washburn housed the USA Custom Shop in a factory at Elston Ave. and Springfield Ave. Grover Jackson ran production for the first half of the 90\u2019s and Larry English ran production for the second half of the 90\u2019s. The building was so old it was used as an icehouse after the great Chicago fire and rumored to have been haunted. At least two guitar heists occurred there when thieves backed a box truck through a wall and loaded the truck with guitars getting away cleanly. \n\nBetween 1994 and 2001, ten models of acoustic guitar were built for Washburn in the United States, five by [[Tacoma Guitars]] (Tacoma, Washington) and five by [[Dana Bourgeois|Bourgeois Guitars]] (Lewiston, Maine).\n\nWashburn brought out a line of four USA-made dreadnoughts, available from 2002 to 2008. These were the D-78, D-80, D-82, and D-84. (All had the \"-SW\" suffix, for \"solid wood,\" indicating that no laminate wood was employed.)\n<!-- trivia: The J-14 (1998) and J-15 (1998-1999) archtops were among the highest-priced Washburn guitars ever made. -->\n\nIn 2012, when JAM Industries declined to renew the lease on the Mundelein facility, the Washburn luthiery closed. At the time, the Washburn facility was the ninth-largest employer in the village (the third-largest business), providing 180 jobs.<ref>[http://www.ci.douglasville.ga.us/DocumentCenter/Home/View/2073 Village of Mundelein 2011 Comprehensive Annual Financial Report]</ref> The stated intent was to reopen at a smaller building in Buffalo Grove (1000 Corporate Grove Drive)<ref>''[https://web.archive.org/web/20170308141152/https://www.highbeam.com/doc/1N1-13D4019E304C9408.html]'', Guitar maker leaves Mundelein.</ref> but this did not materialize. A few Washburn models (particularly the N4) are produced in Cincinnati.\n\nAs of 2017, primary production has largely shifted from Korea to factories in Indonesia and China.\n\n==Innovations==\nMost widely known for its guitars (both [[electric guitar|electric]] and [[acoustic guitar|acoustic]]), Washburn also makes [[electric bass]]es, [[acoustic bass guitar|acoustic basses]], [[banjo]]s, [[mandolin]]s, [[Silent guitar|travel guitar]]s, [[ukulele]]s, and [[amplifier]]s, as well as accessories including guitar cases, clothing, [[Electronic tuner|tuner]]s, and straps.<ref>\n{{cite web\n | title     = Washburn History<!-- Bot generated title -->\n | url       = http://www.washburn.com/community/\n | publisher = Washburn Guitars / U.S. Music Corp., a division of JAM Industries, LTD.\n}}</ref>\n\nIn the 1980s, Washburn introduced the '''Festival Series''' of acoustic/electric guitars (the EA series, for \"electrified acoustic\"). They were thinner than standard acoustic guitars and less acoustically resonant by design, thereby reducing susceptibility to [[audio feedback|feedback]], a significant problem using acoustic or electrified acoustic guitars in large-venue performances. The addition in later models of sound slots (rather than the traditional round soundhole), a patented innovation,  further reduced the possibility of feedback, and the guitars quickly became the go-to stage acoustic for artists such as [[Jimmy Page]], [[George Harrison]], and [[Bob Dylan]]. In the early 1990s when [[MTV]] introduced their [[MTV Unplugged|Unplugged]] series, hardly a show went by without seeing a Festival Series guitar. The design also lent itself well to acoustic basses, and Washburn's AB Series quickly became popular both for its look and its tone, whether amplified or unplugged.\n\n[[File:Washburn RB2802 8-String Bass headstock with Buzz Feiten tuning system.jpg|thumb|right|[[Headstock]] of a Washburn RB2802 eight-string bass.]]\n\nIn recent years, Washburn licensed several guitar construction features:\n* ''the [[Buzz Feiten]] Tuning System'' &mdash; a corrected-temperation tuning formula, using a compensated nut and saddle to minimize the inherent [[Intonation (music)|intonation]] problems of the Western tuning formula. The BFTS was first used by Washburn in 1995 on a very few models, then increasingly with the introduction of the WI-64 (1999), and was entirely phased out after the 2010 production year. At its peak, this system came standard on U.S.-made Washburn guitars and basses and the better imports.<ref>\n{{cite web\n | title     = Buzz Feiten Tuning System<!-- Bot generated title -->\n | url       = http://www.washburn.com/resources/resources/buzz-feiten.html\n | publisher = Washburn Guitars\n | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20111221035732/http://www.washburn.com/resources/resources/buzz-feiten.html\n | archivedate = 2011-12-21\n}}</ref>\n* ''Stephen's Extended Cutaway'' &mdash; a unique [[bolt-on]] neck joint invented by luthier Stephen Davies to allow greater unrestricted access for a guitarist's fretting hand.

Additional letters may be used to indicate the instrument's finish. While imperfectly applied, and sometimes awkwardly long, this can often be useful in identifying a given guitar.\n;suffix \u2014\n* C - cutaway\n* DL - deluxe (generally, a standard model with a few upgraded features)\n* E - electric (i.e., built-in pickup)\n* K - kit (i.e., includes case or gig bag)\n* LH - left-handed\n* M - mahogany top\n* Q - quilt maple top\n* R - rosewood\n* S - solid-wood top (rather than laminate)\n* SP - spalt maple top\n* SW - solid wood used throughout\n* V - vibrato (on electric guitars)\nThis often combines with the prefix to tell a guitar's story.

{"title_page": "Intensive and extensive properties", "text_new": "{{short description|Property (of a system or substance) that is intensive or is extensive}}\n{{Thermodynamics|expanded=sysprop}}\n[[Physical properties]] of materials and [[system]]s can often be categorized as being either '''intensive''' or '''extensive''', according to how the property changes when the size (or extent) of the system changes.  According to [[International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry|IUPAC]], an intensive quantity is one whose magnitude is independent of the size of the system<ref>{{GoldBookRef|file=I03074|title=Intensive quantity}}</ref> whereas an extensive quantity is one whose magnitude is additive for subsystems.<ref>{{GoldBookRef|file=E02281|title=Extensive quantity}}</ref> This reflects the corresponding mathematical ideas of [[mean_(statistics)|mean]] and [[measure_(mathematics)|measure]], respectively.\n\nAn ''intensive property''' is a '''bulk property''', meaning that it is a [[principle of locality|local]] [[physical property]] of a system that does not depend on the system size or the amount of material in the system. Examples of intensive properties include temperature, ''T''; refractive index, ''n''; density, ''\u03c1''; and hardness of an object, ''\u03b7''.\n\nBy contrast, '''extensive properties''' such as the mass, volume and entropy of systems are additive for subsystems because they increase and decrease as they grow larger and smaller, respectively.<ref name=\"IUPACgreen\">{{cite book | url=http://media.iupac.org/publications/books/gbook/IUPAC-GB3-2ndPrinting-Online-22apr2011.pdf | title=IUPAC Green Book | publisher=IUPAC and RSC Publishing | author=Cohen, E.

Tolman]] in 1917.<ref name=\"Tolman\">{{cite journal | url=https://books.google.com/?id=KvMKAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA237&lpg=PA237&dq=The+Measurable+Quantities+of+Physics#v=onepage&q=The%20Measurable%20Quantities%20of%20Physics&f=false | title=The Measurable Quantities of Physics | author=Tolman, Richard C. | journal=Phys. Rev. | year=1917 | volume=9 | issue=3 | pages=237\u2013253}}</ref>\n\n==Intensive properties==\nAn intensive property is a [[physical quantity]] whose value does not depend on the amount of the substance for which it is measured. For example, the [[temperature]] of a system in thermal equilibrium is the same as the temperature of any part of it. If the system is divided, the temperature of each subsystem is identical. The same applies to the [[density]] of a homogeneous system; if the system is divided in half, the mass and the volume are both divided in half and the density remains unchanged. Additionally, the boiling point of a substance is another example of an intensive property. For example, the boiling point of water is 100&nbsp;\u00b0C at a pressure of one [[atmosphere (unit)|atmosphere]], which remains true regardless of quantity.\n\nThe distinction between intensive and extensive properties has some theoretical uses.  For example, in thermodynamics, according to the [[state postulate]]: \"The state of a simple compressible system is completely specified by two independent, intensive properties\". Other intensive properties are derived from those two variables.\n\n===Examples===\nExamples of intensive properties include:<ref name=IUPACgreen /><ref name=Tolman /><ref name=Redlich />\n{{div col|colwidth=22em}}\n* [[chemical potential]], ''\u03bc''\n* [[color]]<ref name=\"Chang\">{{cite book | title=Chemistry | publisher=McGraw-Hill Education |author1=Chang, R. |author2=Goldsby, K. | year=2015 | pages=312 | isbn=978-0078021510 | edition=12}}</ref>\n* [[concentration]], ''c''\n* [[density]], ''\u03c1''  (or [[specific gravity]])\n* [[permeability (electromagnetism)|magnetic permeability]], ''\u03bc''\n* [[melting point]] and [[boiling point]]<ref name=BrownLeMay />\n* [[molality]], ''m'' or ''b''\n* [[pressure]], ''p''\n* [[refractive index]]\n* [[Electrical resistivity and conductivity|Specific conductance]] (or electrical conductivity) \n* [[specific heat capacity]], ''c<sub>p</sub>''\n* [[specific internal energy]], ''u''\n* [[specific rotation]], [''\u03b1'']\n* [[specific volume]], ''v''\n* [[standard reduction potential]],<ref name=\"BrownLeMay\">{{cite book | title=Chemistry: The Central Science | publisher=Prentice Hall |author1=Brown, T.

The symbol for molar quantities may be indicated by adding a subscript \"m\" to the corresponding extensive property.  For example, molar enthalpy is ''H''<sub>m</sub>.<ref name=\"IUPACgreen\" />  Molar Gibbs free energy is commonly referred to as [[chemical potential]], symbolized by ''\u03bc'', particularly when discussing a partial molar Gibbs free energy ''\u03bc<sub>i</sub>'' for a component ''i'' in a mixture.\n\nFor the characterization of substances or reactions, tables usually report the molar properties referred to a [[standard state]]. In that case an additional superscript \u00b0 is added to the symbol. Examples:\n* ''V''<sub>m</sub>\u00b0 = {{gaps|22.41|[[liter|L]]/mol}} is the molar volume of an [[ideal gas]] at [[standard conditions for temperature and pressure]]. \n* ''C''<sub>''P'',m</sub>\u00b0 is the standard molar heat capacity of a substance at constant pressure.\n* \u0394<sub>r</sub>''H''<sub>m</sub>\u00b0 is the standard enthalpy variation of a reaction (with subcases: formation enthalpy, combustion enthalpy...).\n* ''E''\u00b0 is the [[standard reduction potential]] of a [[redox couple]], i.e. Gibbs energy over charge, which is measured in [[volt]] = J/C.\n\n==Potential sources of confusion==\n\nThe use of the term {{em|intensive}} is potentially confusing. The meaning here is \"something within the area, length, or size of something\", and often constrained by it, as opposed to \"extensive\", \"something without the area, more than that\".\n\n==Limitations==\n\nThe general validity of the division of physical properties into extensive and intensive kinds has been addressed in the course of science.<ref name= \"Hatsopoulos\">{{cite book | title=Principles of General Thermodynamics | publisher=John Wiley and Sons | author=George N.

Redlich pointed out that the assignment of some properties as intensive or extensive may depend on the way subsystems are arranged. For example, if two identical [[galvanic cell]]s are connected in [[Series and parallel circuits|parallel]], the [[voltage]] of the system is equal to the voltage of each cell, while the [[electric charge]] transferred (or the [[electric current]]) is extensive. However, if the same cells are connected in [[Series and parallel circuits|series]], the charge becomes intensive and the voltage extensive.<ref name=Redlich/> The IUPAC definitions do not consider such cases.<ref name=IUPACgreen/>\n\nSome intensive properties do not apply at very small sizes.  For example, [[viscosity]] is a [[macroscopic]] [[quantity]] and is not relevant for extremely small systems.  Likewise, at a very small scale [[color]] is not independent of size, as shown by [[quantum dots]], whose color depends on the size of the \"dot\".\n\n==Complex systems and entropy production==\n[[Ilya Prigogine]]\u2019s <ref name=\"Prigogine\">{{cite book | title=Order Out of Chaos, MAN\u2019S NEW DIALOGUE WITH NATURE | publisher=Verso | author=Ilya Prigogine, Isabelle Stengers | year=2018 | isbn=9781786631008}}</ref> groundbreaking work shows that every form of energy is made up of an intensive variable and an extensive variable. Measuring these two factors and taking the product of these two variables gives us an amount for that particular form of energy. If we take the energy of expansion the intensive variable is pressure (P) and the extensive variable is the volume (V) we get PxV this is then the energy of expansion. Likewise one can do this for density/mass movement where density and velocity (intensive) and volume (extensive) essentially describe the energy of the movement of mass.\n\nOther energy forms can be derived from this relationship also such as electrical, thermal, sound, springs. Within the quantum realm, it appears that energy is made up of intensive factors mainly. For example, the frequency is intensive. It appears that as one passes to the subatomic realms the intensive factor is more dominant. The example is the quantum dot where color (intensive variable) is dictated by size, size is normally an extensive variable. There appears to be the integration of these variables. This then appears as the basis of the quantum effect.\n\nThe key insight to all this is that the difference in the intensive variable gives us the entropic force and the change in the extensive variable gives us the entropic flux for a particular form of energy. A series of entropy production formulas can be derived. \n\n: \u2206S <sub>heat</sub>= [(1/T)<sub>a</sub>-(1/T)<sub>b</sub>] x \u2206 thermal energy\n\n: \u2206S <sub>expansion</sub>= [(pressure/T)<sub>a</sub>-(pressure/T)<sub>b</sub>] x \u2206 volume\n\n: \u2206S <sub>electric</sub> = [(voltage/T)<sub>a</sub>-(voltage/T)<sub>b</sub>] x \u2206 current\n\nThese equations have the form \n\n: \u2206S<sub>s</sub> = [(intensive)<sub>a</sub>  -(intensive)<sub>b</sub>] x \u2206 extensive<br>where the a and b are two different regions. \n\nThis is the long version of Prigogine\u2019s equation\n\n: \u2206S<sub>s</sub> = X<sub>s</sub>J<sub>s</sub> <br>where X<sub>s</sub> is the entropic force and J<sub>s</sub> is the entropic flux. \n\nIt is possible to derive a number of different energy forms from Prigogine\u2019s equation. \n\nNote that in thermal energy in the entropy production equation the intensive factor\u2019s numerator is 1. Whilst the other equations we have a numerator of pressure and voltage and the denominator is still temperature. This means lower than the level of molecules there are no definite stable units.\n\n== Properties in geopraphic scale  ==\n:(stub section)\n\n''Spatially intensive properties'' and ''spatially extensive properties'', see article review of the theme, https://doi.org/10.1080/13658810600965271\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Intensive And Extensive Properties}}\n[[Category:Physical quantities]]\n[[Category:Thermodynamic properties]]\n", "text_old": "{{short description|Property (of a system or substance) that is intensive or is extensive}}\n{{Thermodynamics|expanded=sysprop}}\n[[Physical properties]] of materials and [[system]]s can often be categorized as being either '''intensive''' or '''extensive''', according to how the property changes when the size (or extent) of the system changes.  According to [[International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry|IUPAC]], an intensive quantity is one whose magnitude is independent of the size of the system<ref>{{GoldBookRef|file=I03074|title=Intensive quantity}}</ref> whereas an extensive quantity is one whose magnitude is additive for subsystems.<ref>{{GoldBookRef|file=E02281|title=Extensive quantity}}</ref> This reflects the corresponding mathematical ideas of [[mean_(statistics)|mean]] and [[measure_(mathematics)|measure]], respectively.\n\nAn ''intensive property''' is a '''bulk property''', meaning that it is a [[principle of locality|local]] [[physical property]] of a system that does not depend on the system size or the amount of material in the system. Examples of intensive properties include temperature, ''T''; refractive index, ''n''; density, ''\u03c1''; and hardness of an object, ''\u03b7''.\n\nBy contrast, '''extensive properties''' such as the mass, volume and entropy of systems are additive for subsystems because they increase and decrease as they grow larger and smaller, respectively.<ref name=\"IUPACgreen\">{{cite book | url=http://media.iupac.org/publications/books/gbook/IUPAC-GB3-2ndPrinting-Online-22apr2011.pdf | title=IUPAC Green Book | publisher=IUPAC and RSC Publishing | author=Cohen, E.

For example, the [[temperature]] of a system in thermal equilibrium is the same as the temperature of any part of it. If the system is divided, the temperature of each subsystem is identical. The same applies to the [[density]] of a homogeneous system; if the system is divided in half, the mass and the volume are both divided in half and the density remains unchanged. Additionally, the boiling point of a substance is another example of an intensive property. For example, the boiling point of water is 100&nbsp;\u00b0C at a pressure of one [[atmosphere (unit)|atmosphere]], which remains true regardless of quantity.\n\nThe distinction between intensive and extensive properties has some theoretical uses.  For example, in thermodynamics, according to the [[state postulate]]: \"The state of a simple compressible system is completely specified by two independent, intensive properties\".

The symbol for molar quantities may be indicated by adding a subscript \"m\" to the corresponding extensive property.  For example, molar enthalpy is ''H''<sub>m</sub>.<ref name=\"IUPACgreen\" />  Molar Gibbs free energy is commonly referred to as [[chemical potential]], symbolized by ''\u03bc'', particularly when discussing a partial molar Gibbs free energy ''\u03bc<sub>i</sub>'' for a component ''i'' in a mixture.\n\nFor the characterization of substances or reactions, tables usually report the molar properties referred to a [[standard state]]. In that case an additional superscript \u00b0 is added to the symbol. Examples:\n* ''V''<sub>m</sub>\u00b0 = {{gaps|22.41|[[liter|L]]/mol}} is the molar volume of an [[ideal gas]] at [[standard conditions for temperature and pressure]]. \n* ''C''<sub>''P'',m</sub>\u00b0 is the standard molar heat capacity of a substance at constant pressure.\n* \u0394<sub>r</sub>''H''<sub>m</sub>\u00b0 is the standard enthalpy variation of a reaction (with subcases: formation enthalpy, combustion enthalpy...).\n* ''E''\u00b0 is the [[standard reduction potential]] of a [[redox couple]], i.e. Gibbs energy over charge, which is measured in [[volt]] = J/C.\n\n==Potential sources of confusion==\n\nThe use of the term {{em|intensive}} is potentially confusing. The meaning here is \"something within the area, length, or size of something\", and often constrained by it, as opposed to \"extensive\", \"something without the area, more than that\".\n\n==Limitations==\n\nThe general validity of the division of physical properties into extensive and intensive kinds has been addressed in the course of science.<ref name= \"Hatsopoulos\">{{cite book | title=Principles of General Thermodynamics | publisher=John Wiley and Sons | author=George N. Hatsopoulos, G. N.; Keenan, J. H. | year=1965 | pages=19\u201320 | isbn=9780471359999}}</ref> [[Otto Redlich|Redlich]] noted that, although physical properties and especially thermodynamic properties are most conveniently defined as either intensive or extensive, these two categories are not all-inclusive and some well-defined physical properties conform to neither definition.<ref name=\"Redlich\">{{cite journal | title=Intensive and Extensive Properties | author=Redlich, O. | journal=J.

Redlich pointed out that the assignment of some properties as intensive or extensive may depend on the way subsystems are arranged. For example, if two identical [[galvanic cell]]s are connected in [[Series and parallel circuits|parallel]], the [[voltage]] of the system is equal to the voltage of each cell, while the [[electric charge]] transferred (or the [[electric current]]) is extensive. However, if the same cells are connected in [[Series and parallel circuits|series]], the charge becomes intensive and the voltage extensive.<ref name=Redlich/> The IUPAC definitions do not consider such cases.<ref name=IUPACgreen/>\n\nSome intensive properties do not apply at very small sizes.  For example, [[viscosity]] is a [[macroscopic]] [[quantity]] and is not relevant for extremely small systems.  Likewise, at a very small scale [[color]] is not independent of size, as shown by [[quantum dots]], whose color depends on the size of the \"dot\".\n\n==Complex systems and entropy production==\n[[Ilya Prigogine]]\u2019s <ref name=\"Prigogine\">{{cite book | title=Order Out of Chaos, MAN\u2019S NEW DIALOGUE WITH NATURE | publisher=Verso | author=Ilya Prigogine, Isabelle Stengers | year=2018 | isbn=9781786631008}}</ref> groundbreaking work shows that every form of energy is made up of an intensive variable and an extensive variable. Measuring these two factors and taking the product of these two variables gives us an amount for that particular form of energy. If we take the energy of expansion the intensive variable is pressure (P) and the extensive variable is the volume (V) we get PxV this is then the energy of expansion. Likewise one can do this for density/mass movement where density and velocity (intensive) and volume (extensive) essentially describe the energy of the movement of mass.\n\nOther energy forms can be derived from this relationship also such as electrical, thermal, sound, springs. Within the quantum realm, it appears that energy is made up of intensive factors mainly. For example, the frequency is intensive. It appears that as one passes to the subatomic realms the intensive factor is more dominant. The example is the quantum dot where color (intensive variable) is dictated by size, size is normally an extensive variable. There appears to be the integration of these variables. This then appears as the basis of the quantum effect.\n\nThe key insight to all this is that the difference in the intensive variable gives us the entropic force and the change in the extensive variable gives us the entropic flux for a particular form of energy. A series of entropy production formulas can be derived. \n\n: \u2206S <sub>heat</sub>= [(1/T)<sub>a</sub>-(1/T)<sub>b</sub>] x \u2206 thermal energy\n\n: \u2206S <sub>expansion</sub>= [(pressure/T)<sub>a</sub>-(pressure/T)<sub>b</sub>] x \u2206 volume\n\n: \u2206S <sub>electric</sub> = [(voltage/T)<sub>a</sub>-(voltage/T)<sub>b</sub>] x \u2206 current\n\nThese equations have the form \n\n: \u2206S<sub>s</sub> = [(intensive)<sub>a</sub>  -(intensive)<sub>b</sub>] x \u2206 extensive<br>where the a and b are two different regions. \n\nThis is the long version of Prigogine\u2019s equation\n\n: \u2206S<sub>s</sub> = X<sub>s</sub>J<sub>s</sub> <br>where X<sub>s</sub> is the entropic force and J<sub>s</sub> is the entropic flux. \n\nIt is possible to derive a number of different energy forms from Prigogine\u2019s equation. \n\nNote that in thermal energy in the entropy production equation the intensive factor\u2019s numerator is 1. Whilst the other equations we have a numerator of pressure and voltage and the denominator is still temperature. This means lower than the level of molecules there are no definite stable units.\n\n== Properties in geopraphic scale  ==\n:(stub section)\n\n''Spatially intensive properties'' and ''spatially extensive properties'', see article review of the theme, https://doi.org/10.1080/13658810600965271\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Intensive And Extensive Properties}}\n[[Category:Physical quantities]]\n[[Category:Thermodynamic properties]]\n", "name_user": "182.70.31.175", "label": "unsafe", "comment": "(\u2192\u200e{{anchor|\"Specific\" properties I think this is Important}} Specific properties)", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intensive_and_extensive_properties"}

Despite losing the first match to Queensland the tour was a great success, the Lions winning the Test series against the [[All Blacks]]. They are still the only Lions side to have won a Test series in New Zealand. The side was captained by [[John Dawes]], coached by [[Carwyn James]] and managed by [[Doug Smith (rugby union)|Doug Smith]].\n\nAlthough the Lions had done poorly when touring New Zealand in 1966 (they lost all four Tests to the All Blacks), the seeds had been sown for the successful series of 1971. Wales had won the [[Grand Slam (Rugby Union)#Six Nations Championship|Grand Slam]] in the [[Six Nations Championship|Five Nations Championship]] in 1971, and appropriately supplied more players than any other home nation to the touring squad. Both the coach and captain were also Welsh. This was the only tour to result in a Lions victory over the All Blacks. A major factor in their victory was self belief. [[Gerald Davies]] explained, \"...somewhere along the line it becomes a mental thing...We grew in confidence; we came to believe it was possible to beat the All Blacks.\"<ref>Palenski, R: ''Century in Black, 100 Years of All Black Test Rugby'', page 122. Hodder Moa Beckett Publishers Ltd, 2003</ref>\n\nThe Lions won the [[#First Test|first Test]] in Dunedin 9\u20133, with a penalty goal to the All Blacks, and two penalties and a try, (scored by [[Ian McLauchlan]]) to the Lions. Several Lions players later admitted they were overconfident following their initial Test victory. The Lions were thus convincingly beaten 22\u201312 in the [[#Second Test|second Test]] in Christchurch, with the All Blacks outscoring them five tries (Bob Burgess (2), [[Sid Going]], [[Ian Kirkpatrick]], pen try) to two (Davies (2)). The [[#Third Test|third Test]] was played at [[Athletic Park (Wellington)|Athletic Park]], Wellington. The Lions did not make the same mistake they had in Christchurch, resulting in a 13\u20133 win, the Lions scored two converted tries and a drop goal. The All Blacks managed only a try.\n\nFollowing the third Test the Lions led the series 2\u20131. The final game played in [[Auckland]] would require an All Black victory for New Zealand to draw the series. A draw or Lions victory would give the Lions a series win. Scores were level 8\u20138 at half time with a try, conversion and penalty each. The first 15 minutes of the second half saw the Lions land a penalty goal and the All Blacks score a try. With the scores tied 11\u201311, Lions [[Fullback (rugby union)|fullback]] [[JPR Williams]] received the ball 45 metres out and attempted a drop goal, it was successful and put the Lions ahead 14\u201311. Williams's drop goal was the only one he landed in his Test career.

Despite losing the first match to Queensland the tour was a great success, the Lions winning the Test series against the [[All Blacks]]. They are still the only Lions side to have won a Test series in New Zealand. The side was captained by [[John Dawes]], coached by [[Carwyn James]] and managed by [[Doug Smith (rugby union)|Doug Smith]].\n\nAlthough the Lions had done poorly when touring New Zealand in 1966 (they lost all four Tests to the All Blacks), the seeds had been sown for the successful series of 1971. Wales had won the [[Grand Slam (Rugby Union)#Six Nations Championship|Grand Slam]] in the [[Six Nations Championship|Five Nations Championship]] in 1971, and appropriately supplied more players than any other home nation to the touring squad. Both the coach and captain were also Welsh. This was the only tour to result in a Lions victory over the All Blacks. A major factor in their victory was self belief. [[Gerald Davies]] explained, \"...somewhere along the line it becomes a mental thing...We grew in confidence; we came to believe it was possible to beat the All Blacks.\"<ref>Palenski, R: ''Century in Black, 100 Years of All Black Test Rugby'', page 122. Hodder Moa Beckett Publishers Ltd, 2003</ref>\n\nThe Lions won the [[#First Test|first Test]] in Dunedin 9\u20133, with a penalty goal to the All Blacks, and two penalties and a try, (scored by [[Ian McLauchlan]]) to the Lions. Several Lions players later admitted they were overconfident following their initial Test victory. The Lions were thus convincingly beaten 22\u201312 in the [[#Second Test|second Test]] in Christchurch, with the All Blacks outscoring them five tries (Bob Burgess (2), [[Sid Going]], [[Ian Kirkpatrick]], pen try) to two (Davies (2)). The [[#Third Test|third Test]] was played at [[Athletic Park (Wellington)|Athletic Park]], Wellington. The Lions did not make the same mistake they had in Christchurch, resulting in a 13\u20133 win, the Lions scored two converted tries and a drop goal. The All Blacks managed only a try.\n\nFollowing the third Test the Lions led the series 2\u20131. The final game played in [[Auckland]] would require an All Black victory for New Zealand to draw the series. A draw or Lions victory would give the Lions a series win. Scores were level 8\u20138 at half time with a try, conversion and penalty each. The first 15 minutes of the second half saw the Lions land a penalty goal and the All Blacks score a try. With the scores tied 11\u201311, Lions [[Fullback (rugby union)|fullback]] [[JPR Williams]] received the ball 45 metres out and attempted a drop goal, it was successful and put the Lions ahead 14\u201311. Williams's drop goal was the only one he landed in his Test career. The All Blacks could only manage three further points from a penalty to draw the game 14-14, which gave the Lions the series.\n\n==Squad==\n\n===Backs===\n* [[John Dawes]] ([[London Welsh R.F.C.|London Welsh]] and Wales) (captain)\n* [[J.P.R.
