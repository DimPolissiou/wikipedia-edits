Also [[Algeciras]].\n\n==History==\n===Launch===\n'''Al Jazeera Satellite Channel''', now known as AJA, was launched on 1 November 1996 following the closure of the [[BBC]]'s [[Arabic language]] television station, a joint venture with [[Orbit Communications Company]]. The BBC channel had closed after a year and a half when the Saudi government attempted to suppress information, including a graphic report on executions and prominent dissident views.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://allied-media.com/aljazeera/jazeera_history.html |title=AL JAZEERA TV: The History of the Controversial Middle East News Station Arabic News Satellite Channel History of the Controversial Station |publisher=Allied-media |accessdate=12 April 2012}}</ref>\n\nThe [[List of emirs of Qatar|Emir of Qatar]], [[Sheikh]] [[Hamad bin Khalifa]], provided a loan of [[Qatari riyal|QAR]] 500 million ([[US$]]137&nbsp;million) to sustain Al Jazeera through its first five years, as Hugh Miles detailed in his book ''Al Jazeera: The Inside Story of the Arab News Channel That Is Challenging the West''. Shares were held by private investors as well as the [[Qatar]] government.\n\n[[File:Al jazeera arabic.jpg|thumb|Al Jazeera Arabic Building]]\nAl Jazeera's first day on the air was 1 November 1996. It offered 6 hours of programming per day; this increased to 12 hours of programming by the end of 1997. It was broadcast to the immediate neighborhood as a terrestrial signal, and on cable. Al Jazeera is also available through satellites (which was also free to users in the Arab world), although Qatar, and many other Arab countries barred private individuals from having satellite dishes until 2001.\n\nAt the time of the Al Jazeera Media Network launch [[Arabsat]] was the only satellite broadcasting to the Middle East, and for the first year could only offer Al Jazeera a weak [[C band (IEEE)|C-band]] transponder that needed a large satellite dish for reception. A more powerful [[Ku band|K<sub>u</sub>-band]] transponder became available as a peace-offering after its user, [[Canal France International]], accidentally beamed 30 minutes of pornography into ultraconservative Saudi Arabia.<ref>{{cite news|last=|first=|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140201141941/www.hurriyetdailynews.com/default.aspx?pageid=438&n=france-seeks-to-soothe-arab-anger-over-porn-film-1997-07-23|title=France seeks to soothe Arab anger over porn film|date=|newspaper=Hurriyet|accessdate=17 June 2012|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nAl Jazeera was not the first such broadcaster in the Middle East; a number had appeared since the Arabsat satellite, a Saudi Arabia-based venture of 21 Arab governments, took orbit in 1985. The unfolding of [[Operation Desert Storm]] on [[CNN International]] underscored the power of live television in current events. While other local broadcasters in the region would assiduously avoid material embarrassing to their home governments (Qatar had its own official TV station as well), Al Jazeera was pitched as an impartial news source and platform for discussing issues relating to the Arab world.\n\nIn presenting \"The opinion and the other opinion\" (the station's motto), it did not take long for Al Jazeera to shock local viewers by presenting Israelis speaking [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] on Arab television for the first time.{{citation needed|date=August 2015}} Lively and far-ranging talk shows, particularly a popular, confrontational one called ''The Opposite Direction'', were a constant source of controversy regarding issues of morality and religion. This prompted a torrent of criticism from the conservative voices among the region's press. It also led to official complaints and censures from neighboring governments. Some jammed Al Jazeera's terrestrial broadcast or expelled its correspondents. In 1999, the Algerian government reportedly cut power to several major cities in order to censor one broadcast. There were also commercial repercussions: Saudi Arabia reportedly pressured advertisers to avoid the channel, to great effect.\n\nAl Jazeera was the only international news network to have correspondents in Iraq during the [[Operation Desert Fox]] bombing campaign in 1998. In a precursor of a pattern to follow, its exclusive video clips were highly prized by [[Western culture|Western]] media.\n\n===Around the clock===\n1 January 1999 was Al Jazeera's first day of 24-hour broadcasting.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.aljazeera.com/archive/2006/11/2008410115625813175.html |title=A decade of growth |publisher=Al Jazeera English |date=1 November 2006 |accessdate=18 November 2012}}</ref> Employment had more than tripled in one year to 500 employees. The agency had bureaux at a dozen sites as far away as EU and Russia. Its annual budget was estimated at about $25&nbsp;million at the time.\n\nHowever controversial, Al Jazeera was rapidly becoming one of the most influential news agencies in the whole region. Eager for news beyond the official versions of events, Arabs became dedicated viewers. A 2000 estimate pegged nightly viewership at 35 million, ranking Al Jazeera first in the Arab world, over the Saudi Arabia-sponsored [[Middle East Broadcasting Centre]] (MBC) and London's [[Arab News Network]] (ANN). There were about 70 satellite or terrestrial channels being broadcast to the Middle East, most of them in Arabic. Al Jazeera launched a free Arabic-language web site in January 2001. In addition, the TV feed was soon available in the United Kingdom for the first time via [[British Sky Broadcasting]].\n\n===War in Afghanistan===\nAl Jazeera came to the attention of many in the West during the hunt for [[Osama bin Laden]] and the [[Taliban]] in Afghanistan after the [[11 September attacks|11 September 2001 attacks]] on the United States. It aired videos it received from Osama bin Laden and the Taliban, deeming new footage of the world's most wanted fugitives to be newsworthy. Some criticized the network for giving a voice to terrorists.<ref>{{cite web |author=Joel Campagna |url=http://cpj.org/reports/2001/10/aljazeera-oct01.php |title=Between Two Worlds |publisher=Committee to Protect Journalists |date=October 2001 |accessdate=18 November 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |author=Jennifer Bryson |url=http://archive.newsmax.com/archives/articles/2001/10/30/202458.shtml |title=Analysis: Is Rumsfeld's Criticism of Al-Jazeera Justified? |publisher=Newsmax |date=30 October 2001 |accessdate=18 November 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130127185534/http://archive.newsmax.com/archives/articles/2001/10/30/202458.shtml |archivedate=27 January 2013}}</ref> Al Jazeera's Washington, D.C., bureau chief, Hafez al-Mirazi, compared the situation to that of the [[Unabomber]]'s messages in ''[[The New York Times]]''.<ref>{{cite web |author=Joe Eskenazi |url=http://www.jweekly.com/article/full/20801/al-jazeera-not-all-bin-laden-all-the-time-d-c-bureau-chief-says/ |title=Al-Jazeera not 'all bin Laden, all the time,' D.C. bureau chief says |publisher=Jweekly |date=17 October 2003 |accessdate=18 November 2012}}</ref> The network said it had been given the tapes because it had a large Arab audience.<ref>{{cite news |author=Fouad Ajami |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2001/11/18/magazine/18ALJAZEERA.html?pagewanted=all |title=What the Muslim World Is Watching |newspaper=The New York Times |date=18 November 2001 |accessdate=18 November 2012}}</ref>\n\nMany other TV networks were eager to acquire the same footage.

It also took in fees for sharing its news feed with other networks. It had an estimated 45 million viewers around the world.

The channel and its web site also were seeing unprecedented attention from viewers looking for alternatives to embedded reporting and military press conferences.\n\nAl Jazeera moved its sports coverage to a new, separate channel on 1 November 2003, allowing for more news and public affairs programming on the original channel. An English language web site had launched earlier in March 2003. The channel had about 1,300 to 1,400 employees, its newsroom editor told [[The New York Times]].

Prior to the arrival of Al Jazeera, many Middle Eastern citizens were unable to watch TV channels other than state-controlled national TV stations. Al Jazeera introduced a level of [[freedom of speech]] on TV that was previously unheard of in many of these countries. Al Jazeera presented controversial views regarding the governments of many Arab states on the Persian Gulf, including Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Bahrain and Qatar; it also presented controversial views about Syria's relationship with Lebanon, and the Egyptian judiciary. Critics accused Al Jazeera Media Network of sensationalism in order to increase its audience share. Al Jazeera's broadcasts have sometimes resulted in drastic action: for example, when, on 27 January 1999, critics of the Algerian government appeared on the channel's live program ''El-Itidjah el-Mouakass'' (\"The Opposite Direction\"), the Algerian government cut the electricity supply to large parts of the capital Algiers (and allegedly also to large parts of the country) to prevent the program from being seen.<ref name=\"boot\">{{cite web |url=http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=8215363856234901024 |title=Al Jazeera: The Inside Story of the Arab News Channel that is Challenging the We |accessdate=25 November 2006 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080115033945/http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=8215363856234901024 |archivedate=15 January 2008}} TV programme feat.

However, it was not until late 2001 that Al Jazeera achieved worldwide recognition, when it broadcast video statements by [[al-Qaeda]] leaders.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/middle_east/2460705.stm |title=Al Jazeera and Bin Laden |newspaper=BBC News |date=14 November 2002 |accessdate=12 April 2012 |first=Kathryn |last=Westcott}}</ref>\n\nSome observers have argued that Al Jazeera Media Network has formidable authority as an opinion-maker. Noah Bonsey and Jeb Koogler, for example, writing in the ''[[Columbia Journalism Review]]'', argue that the way in which the station covers any future Israeli-Palestinian peace deal could well determine whether or not that deal is actually accepted by the Palestinian public.<ref>[http://www.cjr.org/campaign_desk/does_the_path_to_middle_east_p.php CJR.org], Does the Path to Middle East Peace Stop in Doha?</ref>\n\n<blockquote><p>The channel's tremendous popularity has also, for better or worse, made it a shaper of public opinion. Its coverage often determines what becomes a story and what does not, as well as how Arab viewers think about issues. Whether in Saudi Arabia, Egypt, Jordan, or Syria, the stories highlighted and the criticisms aired by guests on Al Jazeera's news programs have often significantly affected the course of events in the region.</p>\n\n<p>In Palestine, the station's influence is particularly strong. Recent polling indicates that in the West Bank and Gaza, Al Jazeera is the primary news source for an astounding 53.4 percent of Palestinian viewers. The second and third most watched channels, Palestine TV and Al Arabiya, poll a distant 12.8 percent and 10 percent, respectively. The result of Al Jazeera's market dominance is that it has itself become a mover and shaker in Palestinian politics, helping to craft public perceptions and influence the debate. This has obvious implications for the peace process: how Al Jazeera covers the deliberations and the outcome of any negotiated agreement with Israel will fundamentally shape how it is viewed\u2014and, more importantly, whether it is accepted\u2014by the Palestinian public.</p></blockquote>\n\nAl Jazeera's broad availability in the Arab world \"operat[ing] with less constraint than almost any other Arab outlet, and remain[ing] the most popular channel in the region\", has been perceived as playing a part in the [[Arab Spring]], including the [[Tunisian revolution|Tunisian]] and [[2011 Egyptian revolution|Egyptian revolutions]].

Also [[Algeciras]].\n\n==History==\n===Launch===\n'''Al Jazeera Satellite Channel''', now known as AJA, was launched on 1 November 1996 following the closure of the [[BBC]]'s [[Arabic language]] television station, a joint venture with [[Orbit Communications Company]]. The BBC channel had closed after a year and a half when the Saudi government attempted to suppress information, including a graphic report on executions and prominent dissident views.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://allied-media.com/aljazeera/jazeera_history.html |title=AL JAZEERA TV: The History of the Controversial Middle East News Station Arabic News Satellite Channel History of the Controversial Station |publisher=Allied-media |accessdate=12 April 2012}}</ref>\n\nThe [[List of emirs of Qatar|Emir of Qatar]], [[Sheikh]] [[Hamad bin Khalifa]], provided a loan of [[Qatari riyal|QAR]] 500 million ([[US$]]137&nbsp;million) to sustain Al Jazeera through its first five years, as Hugh Miles detailed in his book ''Al Jazeera: The Inside Story of the Arab News Channel That Is Challenging the West''. Shares were held by private investors as well as the [[Qatar]] government.\n\n[[File:Al jazeera arabic.jpg|thumb|Al Jazeera Arabic Building]]\nAl Jazeera's first day on the air was 1 November 1996. It offered 6 hours of programming per day; this increased to 12 hours of programming by the end of 1997. It was broadcast to the immediate neighborhood as a terrestrial signal, and on cable. Al Jazeera is also available through satellites (which was also free to users in the Arab world), although Qatar, and many other Arab countries barred private individuals from having satellite dishes until 2001.\n\nAt the time of the Al Jazeera Media Network launch [[Arabsat]] was the only satellite broadcasting to the Middle East, and for the first year could only offer Al Jazeera a weak [[C band (IEEE)|C-band]] transponder that needed a large satellite dish for reception. A more powerful [[Ku band|K<sub>u</sub>-band]] transponder became available as a peace-offering after its user, [[Canal France International]], accidentally beamed 30 minutes of pornography into ultraconservative Saudi Arabia.<ref>{{cite news|last=|first=|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140201141941/www.hurriyetdailynews.com/default.aspx?pageid=438&n=france-seeks-to-soothe-arab-anger-over-porn-film-1997-07-23|title=France seeks to soothe Arab anger over porn film|date=|newspaper=Hurriyet|accessdate=17 June 2012|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nAl Jazeera was not the first such broadcaster in the Middle East; a number had appeared since the Arabsat satellite, a Saudi Arabia-based venture of 21 Arab governments, took orbit in 1985. The unfolding of [[Operation Desert Storm]] on [[CNN International]] underscored the power of live television in current events. While other local broadcasters in the region would assiduously avoid material embarrassing to their home governments (Qatar had its own official TV station as well), Al Jazeera was pitched as an impartial news source and platform for discussing issues relating to the Arab world.\n\nIn presenting \"The opinion and the other opinion\" (the station's motto), it did not take long for Al Jazeera to shock local viewers by presenting Israelis speaking [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] on Arab television for the first time.{{citation needed|date=August 2015}} Lively and far-ranging talk shows, particularly a popular, confrontational one called ''The Opposite Direction'', were a constant source of controversy regarding issues of morality and religion. This prompted a torrent of criticism from the conservative voices among the region's press. It also led to official complaints and censures from neighboring governments. Some jammed Al Jazeera's terrestrial broadcast or expelled its correspondents. In 1999, the Algerian government reportedly cut power to several major cities in order to censor one broadcast. There were also commercial repercussions: Saudi Arabia reportedly pressured advertisers to avoid the channel, to great effect.\n\nAl Jazeera was the only international news network to have correspondents in Iraq during the [[Operation Desert Fox]] bombing campaign in 1998. In a precursor of a pattern to follow, its exclusive video clips were highly prized by [[Western culture|Western]] media.\n\n===Around the clock===\n1 January 1999 was Al Jazeera's first day of 24-hour broadcasting.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.aljazeera.com/archive/2006/11/2008410115625813175.html |title=A decade of growth |publisher=Al Jazeera English |date=1 November 2006 |accessdate=18 November 2012}}</ref> Employment had more than tripled in one year to 500 employees. The agency had bureaux at a dozen sites as far away as EU and Russia. Its annual budget was estimated at about $25&nbsp;million at the time.\n\nHowever controversial, Al Jazeera was rapidly becoming one of the most influential news agencies in the whole region. Eager for news beyond the official versions of events, Arabs became dedicated viewers. A 2000 estimate pegged nightly viewership at 35 million, ranking Al Jazeera first in the Arab world, over the Saudi Arabia-sponsored [[Middle East Broadcasting Centre]] (MBC) and London's [[Arab News Network]] (ANN). There were about 70 satellite or terrestrial channels being broadcast to the Middle East, most of them in Arabic. Al Jazeera launched a free Arabic-language web site in January 2001. In addition, the TV feed was soon available in the United Kingdom for the first time via [[British Sky Broadcasting]].\n\n===War in Afghanistan===\nAl Jazeera came to the attention of many in the West during the hunt for [[Osama bin Laden]] and the [[Taliban]] in Afghanistan after the [[11 September attacks|11 September 2001 attacks]] on the United States. It aired videos it received from Osama bin Laden and the Taliban, deeming new footage of the world's most wanted fugitives to be newsworthy. Some criticized the network for giving a voice to terrorists.<ref>{{cite web |author=Joel Campagna |url=http://cpj.org/reports/2001/10/aljazeera-oct01.php |title=Between Two Worlds |publisher=Committee to Protect Journalists |date=October 2001 |accessdate=18 November 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |author=Jennifer Bryson |url=http://archive.newsmax.com/archives/articles/2001/10/30/202458.shtml |title=Analysis: Is Rumsfeld's Criticism of Al-Jazeera Justified? |publisher=Newsmax |date=30 October 2001 |accessdate=18 November 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130127185534/http://archive.newsmax.com/archives/articles/2001/10/30/202458.shtml |archivedate=27 January 2013}}</ref> Al Jazeera's Washington, D.C., bureau chief, Hafez al-Mirazi, compared the situation to that of the [[Unabomber]]'s messages in ''[[The New York Times]]''.<ref>{{cite web |author=Joe Eskenazi |url=http://www.jweekly.com/article/full/20801/al-jazeera-not-all-bin-laden-all-the-time-d-c-bureau-chief-says/ |title=Al-Jazeera not 'all bin Laden, all the time,' D.C. bureau chief says |publisher=Jweekly |date=17 October 2003 |accessdate=18 November 2012}}</ref> The network said it had been given the tapes because it had a large Arab audience.<ref>{{cite news |author=Fouad Ajami |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2001/11/18/magazine/18ALJAZEERA.html?pagewanted=all |title=What the Muslim World Is Watching |newspaper=The New York Times |date=18 November 2001 |accessdate=18 November 2012}}</ref>\n\nMany other TV networks were eager to acquire the same footage.

It also took in fees for sharing its news feed with other networks. It had an estimated 45 million viewers around the world. Al Jazeera soon had to contend with a new rival, [[Al Arabiya]], an offshoot of the [[Middle East Broadcasting Center]], which was set up in nearby Dubai with Saudi financial backing.<ref>{{cite news |author=Peter Feuilherade |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/2780985.stm |title=Al-Jazeera competitor launches |newspaper=BBC News |date=20 February 2003 |accessdate=18 November 2012}}</ref>\n\n===2003 Iraq War===\nBefore and during the United States-led invasion of Iraq, where Al Jazeera had a presence since 1997, the network's facilities and footage were again highly sought by international networks. The channel and its web site also were seeing unprecedented attention from viewers looking for alternatives to embedded reporting and military press conferences.\n\nAl Jazeera moved its sports coverage to a new, separate channel on 1 November 2003, allowing for more news and public affairs programming on the original channel.

Prior to the arrival of Al Jazeera, many Middle Eastern citizens were unable to watch TV channels other than state-controlled national TV stations. Al Jazeera introduced a level of [[freedom of speech]] on TV that was previously unheard of in many of these countries. Al Jazeera presented controversial views regarding the governments of many Arab states on the Persian Gulf, including Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Bahrain and Qatar; it also presented controversial views about Syria's relationship with Lebanon, and the Egyptian judiciary. Critics accused Al Jazeera Media Network of sensationalism in order to increase its audience share. Al Jazeera's broadcasts have sometimes resulted in drastic action: for example, when, on 27 January 1999, critics of the Algerian government appeared on the channel's live program ''El-Itidjah el-Mouakass'' (\"The Opposite Direction\"), the Algerian government cut the electricity supply to large parts of the capital Algiers (and allegedly also to large parts of the country) to prevent the program from being seen.<ref name=\"boot\">{{cite web |url=http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=8215363856234901024 |title=Al Jazeera: The Inside Story of the Arab News Channel that is Challenging the We |accessdate=25 November 2006 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080115033945/http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=8215363856234901024 |archivedate=15 January 2008}} TV programme feat.

However, it was not until late 2001 that Al Jazeera achieved worldwide recognition, when it broadcast video statements by [[al-Qaeda]] leaders.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/middle_east/2460705.stm |title=Al Jazeera and Bin Laden |newspaper=BBC News |date=14 November 2002 |accessdate=12 April 2012 |first=Kathryn |last=Westcott}}</ref>\n\nSome observers have argued that Al Jazeera Media Network has formidable authority as an opinion-maker. Noah Bonsey and Jeb Koogler, for example, writing in the ''[[Columbia Journalism Review]]'', argue that the way in which the station covers any future Israeli-Palestinian peace deal could well determine whether or not that deal is actually accepted by the Palestinian public.<ref>[http://www.cjr.org/campaign_desk/does_the_path_to_middle_east_p.php CJR.org], Does the Path to Middle East Peace Stop in Doha?</ref>\n\n<blockquote><p>The channel's tremendous popularity has also, for better or worse, made it a shaper of public opinion. Its coverage often determines what becomes a story and what does not, as well as how Arab viewers think about issues. Whether in Saudi Arabia, Egypt, Jordan, or Syria, the stories highlighted and the criticisms aired by guests on Al Jazeera's news programs have often significantly affected the course of events in the region.</p>\n\n<p>In Palestine, the station's influence is particularly strong. Recent polling indicates that in the West Bank and Gaza, Al Jazeera is the primary news source for an astounding 53.4 percent of Palestinian viewers. The second and third most watched channels, Palestine TV and Al Arabiya, poll a distant 12.8 percent and 10 percent, respectively. The result of Al Jazeera's market dominance is that it has itself become a mover and shaker in Palestinian politics, helping to craft public perceptions and influence the debate. This has obvious implications for the peace process: how Al Jazeera covers the deliberations and the outcome of any negotiated agreement with Israel will fundamentally shape how it is viewed\u2014and, more importantly, whether it is accepted\u2014by the Palestinian public.</p></blockquote>\n\nAl Jazeera's broad availability in the Arab world \"operat[ing] with less constraint than almost any other Arab outlet, and remain[ing] the most popular channel in the region\", has been perceived as playing a part in the [[Arab Spring]], including the [[Tunisian revolution|Tunisian]] and [[2011 Egyptian revolution|Egyptian revolutions]].

It takes its name from the original name for what later became the [[Kent and East Sussex Railway]], running from Robertsbridge through to [[Headcorn]] in Kent, via [[Tenterden]]. The project is to replace the \u2018missing link\u2019 between [[Robertsbridge]], a station on the [[Hastings Line|Tonbridge to Hastings mainline]], and [[Bodiam]] on the [[Kent and East Sussex Railway]], a [[heritage railway]] which operates from Bodiam to Tenterden. A charity supported by a society of volunteers are attempting to re-establish the railway link. The RVR began by reinstating the first few hundred yards of line eastwards from Robertsbridge, and also a short stretch westwards from Bodiam. In 2010, the latter section was further extended to reach Junction Road. In summer 2011 work began at Robertsbridge to extend further eastwards to Northbridge Street, which entailed the rebuilding of five bridges. By June 2012, this further extension was also completed. In September 2013, a Gala weekend at Robertsbridge marked the progress to date and the start of the next phase - the re-instatement of the section between Northbridge Street and Junction Road, for which statutory permissions are being sought. While the RVR does not yet feature regular passenger trains, the base at Robertsbridge houses a small shop and visitor centre open to the public each Sunday,  utilising a building formerly used as the [[London Victoria railway station|London terminus]] of the [[Venice-Simplon Orient Express|Orient Express]]. There is also a small collection of historic railway vehicles in various stages of preservation.\n\n==Origins==\nThe Kent & East Sussex Railway Preservation Society was formed in 1961 following closure of the line by British Railways.\n\nAfter many trials and tribulations, the [[Tenterden]] Railway Company Limited was incorporated in 1971 as a [[Company limited by guarantee]] and in 1973 was successful in purchasing that part of the line between Tenterden and Bodiam. The Tenterden Railway Company is now known as The Kent & East Sussex Railway (K&ESR), as of January 2004. The preservationists wanted to reopen the line through to Robertsbridge, but were refused permission by the then [[Secretary of State for Transport|Transport Minister]] [[Barbara Castle]] to take over the section between Bodiam and Robertsbridge, despite taking the Minister to the [[High Court of Justice|High Court]]. The latter section was lifted and became abandoned in the mid 1970s. The reason for this refusal was the Ministry plan to build a by-pass to take the A21 around Robertsbridge.\n\nK&ESR focussed efforts on the eastern end of the line. Trains first ran again on the Kent & East Sussex Railway on 3 February 1974 between Tenterden to Rolvenden, the line gradually being restored and extended in stages, reaching [[Wittersham]] Road in 1977, [[Northiam]] in 1990 and finally Bodiam on 2 April 2000, exactly 100 years to the day since the original opening of the line to passengers.\n\nA separate Company, the Rother Valley Railway (East Sussex) Ltd, was formed on 22 May 1991 with the approval of the Tenterden Railway Company to reconstruct the railway between Bodiam and Robertsbridge and has since simplified its name to Rother Valley Railway Ltd. The plan is that K&ESR will operate this extended railway once completed, as its constitution provides.\n\n==Achievements==\n{{unreferenced section|date=July 2014}}\nSince 1991, the Rother Valley Railway has been acquiring parts of the [[trackbed]] as and when possible. Negotiations continue with two remaining landowners to secure the remainder of the route. Planning permission was secured for its scheme at Robertsbridge, and the whole route is safeguarded in the Council's local plan. Liaison continues with the relevant authorities.\n\nFrom 2009 to 2010 the RVR with help from K&ESR and volunteers were able to complete the {{convert|1|mi|km}} extension westwards from near Bodiam station, through Quarry Farm, to the B2244 (Junction Road). The first official train ran on the weekend of 19/20 March 2011. Attention then focussed on extending from Robertsbridge to Northbridge Street, and this was followed by work to recast the Robertsbridge section in readiness for the planned eventual join-up with K&ESR's track, once the necessary permissions have been obtained and construction completed. A gala weekend in 2013 saw a steam passenger train operating at Robertsbridge for the first time since the early 1960s, running up to Northbridge Street. December 2016 saw the reconnection of the RVR to the Network Rail system some 50 years after closure. Planning permission to reinstate the final section eastwards from Northbridge Street to Junction Road was granted in 2017.

It takes its name from the original name for what later became the [[Kent and East Sussex Railway]], running from Robertsbridge through to [[Headcorn]] in Kent, via [[Tenterden]]. The project is to replace the \u2018missing link\u2019 between [[Robertsbridge]], a station on the [[Hastings Line|Tonbridge to Hastings mainline]], and [[Bodiam]] on the [[Kent and East Sussex Railway]], a [[heritage railway]] which operates from Bodiam to Tenterden. A charity supported by a society of volunteers are attempting to re-establish the railway link. The RVR began by reinstating the first few hundred yards of line eastwards from Robertsbridge, and also a short stretch westwards from Bodiam. In 2010, the latter section was further extended to reach Junction Road. In summer 2011 work began at Robertsbridge to extend further eastwards to Northbridge Street, which entailed the rebuilding of five bridges. By June 2012, this further extension was also completed. In September 2013, a Gala weekend at Robertsbridge marked the progress to date and the start of the next phase - the re-instatement of the section between Northbridge Street and Junction Road, for which statutory permissions are being sought. While the RVR does not yet feature regular passenger trains, the base at Robertsbridge houses a small shop and visitor centre open to the public each Sunday,  utilising a building formerly used as the [[London Victoria railway station|London terminus]] of the [[Venice-Simplon Orient Express|Orient Express]]. There is also a small collection of historic railway vehicles in various stages of preservation.\n\n==Origins==\nThe Kent & East Sussex Railway Preservation Society was formed in 1961 following closure of the line by British Railways.\n\nAfter many trials and tribulations, the [[Tenterden]] Railway Company Limited was incorporated in 1971 as a [[Company limited by guarantee]] and in 1973 was successful in purchasing that part of the line between Tenterden and Bodiam. The Tenterden Railway Company is now known as The Kent & East Sussex Railway (K&ESR), as of January 2004. The preservationists wanted to reopen the line through to Robertsbridge, but were refused permission by the then [[Secretary of State for Transport|Transport Minister]] [[Barbara Castle]] to take over the section between Bodiam and Robertsbridge, despite taking the Minister to the [[High Court of Justice|High Court]]. The latter section was lifted and became abandoned in the mid 1970s. The reason for this refusal was the Ministry plan to build a by-pass to take the A21 around Robertsbridge.\n\nK&ESR focussed efforts on the eastern end of the line. Trains first ran again on the Kent & East Sussex Railway on 3 February 1974 between Tenterden to Rolvenden, the line gradually being restored and extended in stages, reaching [[Wittersham]] Road in 1977, [[Northiam]] in 1990 and finally Bodiam on 2 April 2000, exactly 100 years to the day since the original opening of the line to passengers. \n\nA separate Company, the Rother Valley Railway (East Sussex) Ltd, was formed on 22 May 1991 with the approval of the Tenterden Railway Company to reconstruct the railway between Bodiam and Robertsbridge and has since simplified its name to Rother Valley Railway Ltd. The plan is that K&ESR will operate this extended railway once completed, as its constitution provides.\n\n==Achievements==\n{{unreferenced section|date=July 2014}}\nSince 1991, the Rother Valley Railway has been acquiring parts of the [[trackbed]] as and when possible. Negotiations continue with two remaining landowners to secure the remainder of the route. Planning permission was secured for its scheme at Robertsbridge, and the whole route is safeguarded in the Council's local plan. Liaison continues with the relevant authorities.\n\nFrom 2009 to 2010 the RVR with help from K&ESR and volunteers were able to complete the {{convert|1|mi|km}} extension westwards from near Bodiam station, through Quarry Farm, to the B2244 (Junction Road). The first official train ran on the weekend of 19/20 March 2011. Attention then focussed on extending from Robertsbridge to Northbridge Street, and this was followed by work to recast the Robertsbridge section in readiness for the planned eventual join-up with K&ESR's track, once the necessary permissions have been obtained and construction completed. A gala weekend in 2013 saw a steam passenger train operating at Robertsbridge for the first time since the early 1960s, running up to Northbridge Street. December 2016 saw the reconnection of the RVR to the Network Rail system some 50 years after closure. Planning permission to reinstate the final section eastwards from Northbridge Street to Junction Road was granted in 2017.  RVR applied to the Secretary of State for a Transport and Works Act Order on 19 April 2018.
