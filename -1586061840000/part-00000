He later took down the comics because he thought they were \"terrible\". However, he retains the name \"buenothebear\" for his website and his handle on sites such as Twitter. Ward created a student film titled ''Barrista'', starring Bueno the Bear that was later released by Frederator Studios.\n\nWard continued to work on short animations for Frederator's ''[[Random! Cartoons]]'', which aired on the [[Nicktoons Network]]. There he worked with several people who would later join him on the ''Adventure Time'' series, including composer Casey James Basichis, Adam Muto and [[Niki Yang]], many of whom had attended the [[California Institute of the Arts]] alongside Pen. His two shorts were ''The Bravest Warriors'' and the ''Adventure Time'' animated short. The ''Adventure Time'' short was made in 2006 and went on to become an internet phenomenon in 2007, with over a million views by November of that year. Ward initially pitched ''Adventure Time'' to [[Nickelodeon]], but was rejected. It also took some time before [[Cartoon Network]] decided to pick it up.\n\nIn 2007, Ward was hired to work on the first season of Cartoon Network's ''[[The Marvelous Misadventures of Flapjack]]'' as a writer and storyboard artist. ''Flapjack'' was a storyboard-driven show, allowing the storyboard artists to write all the dialogue and draw all the action based on an outline assigned to them. The artists each worked in pairs, and during his time on ''Flapjack'' Ward was partnered up with Mike Roth (formerly the supervising producer of ''[[Regular Show]]'') and later [[Alex Hirsch]], who has since gone on to create the show ''[[Gravity Falls]]'' and develop ''[[Fish Hooks]]'' for [[Disney Channel]]. The experience inspired Pen to approach ''[[Adventure Time]]'' the same way once it was picked up as a series.\n\nIn 2012, Frederator Studios developed ''[[Bravest Warriors]]'' and turned it into a web series for the relaunch of Cartoon Hangover, however Ward has little involvement in the series. Former ''Adventure Time'' lead designer Phil Rynda worked on the redesigns of the characters for the series. The series premiered during the fall of 2012 through Cartoon Hangover's [[YouTube]] channel alongside a comic book series of the same name by [[Boom! Studios]].\n\nSometime during the fifth season of ''Adventure Time'', Ward abruptly stepped down from [[showrunner|running the show]], explaining it was negatively affecting his \"quality of life\". In the October 2, 2014 edition of the ''Rolling Stone'' magazine, Ward stated \"I quit because it was driving me nuts\". However, he continued to work as one of the show's writers and storyboard artists until the end of the season six, and he still serves as an executive producer.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Strauss|first1=Neil|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/tv/features/adventure-time-the-trippiest-show-on-television-20141002|publisher=[[Rolling Stone]]|accessdate=June 22, 2015|title='Adventure Time': The Trippiest Show on Television}}</ref> In an interview with [[Indiewire]] prior to the debut of [[Adventure Time (season 7)|season seven]], head writer [[Kent Osborne]] noted that Ward had stopped writing episode outlines at the beginning of season 7 but still looked over them and provides input.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Kohn|first1=Eric|title=Kent Osborne Explains the Crazy Logic Behind 'Uncle Kent 2' and the 'Adventure Time' Connection|url=http://www.indiewire.com/article/kent-osborne-explains-the-crazy-logic-behind-uncle-kent-2-and-the-adventure-time-connection-20150618|website=[[Indiewire]]|publisher=[[Snagfilms]]|accessdate=June 22, 2015|date=June 18, 2015}}</ref>\n\nIn 2017, Ward was credited as \"Story Consultant\" for the current hard-cover adventure for [[Dungeons and Dragons]] 5th Edition, 'Tomb of Annihilation'.\n\nOn March 16, 2020, a trailer was released for an animated Netflix original show, ''The Midnight Gospel'',<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQJQ3i9HafY|title=YouTube|website=www.youtube.com|access-date=2020-03-27}}</ref> co-created by Ward and [[Duncan Trussell]].

[[Dan Futterman]], [[Calista Flockhart]], [[Hank Azaria]], and [[Christine Baranski]] appear in supporting roles. It is a [[remake]] of the 1978 Franco-Italian film ''[[La Cage aux Folles (film)|La Cage aux Folles]]'' by [[\u00c9douard Molinaro]] starring [[Michel Serrault]] and [[Ugo Tognazzi]].\n\n==Plot==\nArmand Goldman is the openly-gay owner of a [[Drag queen|drag club]] in [[South Beach]] called The Birdcage; his life partner Albert, an effeminate and flamboyant man, plays Starina, the star attraction of the club. They live together in an apartment above The Birdcage with Agador, their flamboyant Guatemalan housekeeper who dreams of being in Albert's drag show as well.\n\nOne day, Armand's son Val (result of Armand's drunken one-night stand with a woman named Katharine) comes home to announce that he has been seeing a young woman named Barbara whom he intends to marry. Although unhappy about the news, Armand agrees to support his son. Unfortunately, Barbara's parents are the ultraconservative Republican Senator Kevin Keeley and his wife Louise.\n\nKevin, who is co-founder of a conservative group called the Coalition for Moral Order, becomes embroiled in a political scandal when his co-founder and fellow senator is found dead in the bed of an underage black prostitute. Louise and Barbara convince Kevin that a visit to his daughter's fianc\u00e9's family would be the perfect way to stave off bad press and travel to South Beach.\n\nBarbara shares news of her father's plan to Val; to cover the Goldmans' truth, she has told her parents that Armand is straight and a [[cultural attach\u00e9]] to Greece. Armand dislikes the idea of being forced into the closet, but agrees to play along, enlisting the help of friends and club employees to redecorate the family's apartment to more closely resemble a traditional household. Val and Armand attempt to get Albert out of the house, but when they fail Albert suggests he'll pose as Val's straight uncle. Armand contacts Katharine and explains the situation; she promises to come to the party and pretend to be his wife. Armand then tries to coach Albert on how to be straight, but Albert's flamboyant nature makes the task difficult. When Albert realizes his plan will not fool anyone, he takes offense and locks himself in his room.\n\nThe Keeleys arrive at the Goldmans (who are calling themselves \"Coleman\" for the evening to hide their Jewish heritage) redecorated apartment; they are greeted by Agador, who is passing himself off as a Greek butler named Spartacus for the night. Unfortunately, Katharine gets caught in traffic, and the Keeleys begin wondering where \"Mrs. Coleman\" is. Suddenly, Albert enters, dressed and styled as a conservative middle-aged woman. Armand, Val, and Barbara are nervous, but Kevin and Louise are tricked by the disguise.\n\nDespite the success of the evening, trouble begins when the senator's chauffeur betrays him to two [[tabloid journalism|tabloid journalists]], Harry Radman and his photographer, who have been hoping for a scoop on the Coalition story and follow the Keeleys to South Beach. While they research The Birdcage, they also remove a note that Armand has left on the door informing Katharine not to come upstairs. When she arrives, she unknowingly reveals the deceptions, leading Val to confess to the scheme and identify Albert as his true parent.\n\nKevin is initially confused by the situation, but Louise informs him of the truth and scolds him for being more concerned with his career than his family's happiness. He discovers that the paparazzi are waiting outside to take his picture. Albert then realizes that there is a way for the family to escape without being recognized. He dresses them in drag and they use the apartment's back entrance to sneak into The Birdcage where they slowly make their way out of the nightclub without incident. Barbara and Val are married in an [[Interfaith officiants|interfaith service]] that both families attend.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Robin Williams]] as Armand Goldman\n* [[Gene Hackman]] as Senator Kevin Keeley\n* [[Nathan Lane]] as Albert Goldman\n* [[Dianne Wiest]] as Louise Keeley\n* [[Dan Futterman]] as Val Goldman\n* [[Calista Flockhart]] as Barbara Keeley\n* [[Hank Azaria]] as Agador Spartacus\n* [[Christine Baranski]] as Katherine\n* [[Tom McGowan]] as Harry Radman\n* [[Grant Heslov]] as ''[[National Enquirer]]'' photographer\n\n==Soundtrack==\nThree songs written by [[Stephen Sondheim]] were adapted and arranged for the film by composer Jonathan Tunick. The song that Albert rehearses during the sequence with the gum-chewing dancer is entitled \"Little Dream\" and was written specifically for use in the film.<ref>Kimmel, Bruce.

[[Dan Futterman]], [[Calista Flockhart]], [[Hank Azaria]], and [[Christine Baranski]] appear in supporting roles. It is a [[remake]] of the 1978 Franco-Italian film ''[[La Cage aux Folles (film)|La Cage aux Folles]]'' by [[\u00c9douard Molinaro]] starring [[Michel Serrault]] and [[Ugo Tognazzi]].\n\n==Plot==\nArmand Goldman is the openly-gay owner of a [[Drag queen|drag club]] in [[South Beach]] called The Birdcage; his life partner Albert, an effeminate and flamboyant man, plays Starina, the star attraction of the club. They live together in an apartment above The Birdcage with Agador, their flamboyant Guatemalan housekeeper who dreams of being in Albert's drag show as well.\n\nOne day, Armand's son Val (result of Armand's drunken one-night stand with a woman named Katharine) comes home to announce that he has been seeing a young woman named Barbara whom he intends to marry. Although unhappy about the news, Armand agrees to support his son. Unfortunately, Barbara's parents are the ultraconservative Republican Senator Kevin Keeley and his wife Louise.\n\nKevin, who is co-founder of a conservative group called the Coalition for Moral Order, becomes embroiled in a political scandal when his co-founder and fellow senator is found dead in the bed of an underage black prostitute. Louise and Barbara convince Kevin that a visit to his daughter's fianc\u00e9's family would be the perfect way to stave off bad press and travel to South Beach.\n\nBarbara shares news of her father's plan to Val; to cover the Goldmans' truth, she has told her parents that Armand is straight and a [[cultural attach\u00e9]] to Greece. Armand dislikes the idea of being forced into the closet, but agrees to play along, enlisting the help of friends and club employees to redecorate the family's apartment to more closely resemble a traditional household. Val and Armand attempt to get Albert out of the house, but when they fail Albert suggests he'll pose as Val's straight uncle. Armand contacts Katharine and explains the situation; she promises to come to the party and pretend to be his wife. Armand then tries to coach Albert on how to be straight, but Albert's flamboyant nature makes the task difficult. When Albert realizes his plan will not fool anyone, he takes offense and locks himself in his room.\n\nThe Keeleys arrive at the Goldmans (who are calling themselves \"Coleman\" for the evening to hide their Jewish heritage) redecorated apartment; they are greeted by Agador, who is passing himself off as a Greek butler named Spartacus for the night. Unfortunately, Katharine gets caught in traffic, and the Keeleys begin wondering where \"Mrs. Coleman\" is. Suddenly, Albert enters, dressed and styled as a conservative middle-aged woman. Armand, Val, and Barbara are nervous, but Kevin and Louise are tricked by the disguise.\n\nDespite the success of the evening, trouble begins when the senator's chauffeur betrays him to two [[tabloid journalism|tabloid journalists]], Harry Radman and his photographer, who have been hoping for a scoop on the Coalition story and follow the Keeleys to South Beach. While they research The Birdcage, they also remove a note that Armand has left on the door informing Katharine not to come upstairs. When she arrives, she unknowingly reveals the deceptions, leading Val to confess to the scheme and identify Albert as his true parent.\n\nKevin is initially confused by the situation, but Louise informs him of the truth and scolds him for being more concerned with his career than his family's happiness. He discovers that the paparazzi are waiting outside to take his picture. Albert then realizes that there is a way for the family to escape without being recognized. He dresses them in drag and they use the apartment's back entrance to sneak into The Birdcage where they slowly make their out of the nightclub without incident. Barbara and Val are married in an [[Interfaith officiants|interfaith service]] that both families attend.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Robin Williams]] as Armand Goldman\n* [[Gene Hackman]] as Senator Kevin Keeley\n* [[Nathan Lane]] as Albert Goldman\n* [[Dianne Wiest]] as Louise Keeley\n* [[Dan Futterman]] as Val Goldman\n* [[Calista Flockhart]] as Barbara Keeley\n* [[Hank Azaria]] as Agador Spartacus\n* [[Christine Baranski]] as Katherine\n* [[Tom McGowan]] as Harry Radman\n* [[Grant Heslov]] as ''[[National Enquirer]]'' photographer\n\n==Soundtrack==\nThree songs written by [[Stephen Sondheim]] were adapted and arranged for the film by composer Jonathan Tunick. The song that Albert rehearses during the sequence with the gum-chewing dancer is entitled \"Little Dream\" and was written specifically for use in the film.<ref>Kimmel, Bruce. [http://www.sondheim.com/shows/the_birdcage/ \"The Birdcage\"]. [[Stephen Sondheim|Sondheim.com]]. Retrieved May 10, 2012.</ref> Albert's first song as \"Starina\" is \"Can That Boy Foxtrot\", cut from Sondheim's ''[[Follies]]''. The song that Armand and Katherine sing and dance to in her office, \"Love Is in the Air\", had been intended as the opening number for the musical ''[[A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Forum]]'' in 1962. The song was cut from the show and replaced with ''Comedy Tonight.''<ref>[http://www.sondheim.com/shows/a_funny_thing_happened/#cut_songs \"A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Forum \"].
