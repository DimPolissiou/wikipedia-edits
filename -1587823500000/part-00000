Every episode ends with the family being ripped off, or either of the men getting a beating from his wife for flirting with other women. The storyline starts off with Nabeel and Mehmood living in an apartment as bachelors and progresses to both of them marrying and having children.\n\nThe show is known to break the [[fourth wall]] all the time.\n\n====Episode 1-25 (Pre-marriage)====\nNabeel's childhood friend Ahmad moves abroad and tells Nabeel to look after his apartment. Nabeel takes advantage of this and starts living in the apartment as landlord and rents out a room to Mehmood. Khoobsoorat, who ran away from her wedding just fifteen minutes before it took place, arrives at the same apartment looking for her friend Saima, who is married to Ahmed. Although Nabeel first tells her she cannot move in, he changes his mind after she threatens to tell Saima about the misuse of the apartment.\n\nWhen Khoobsoorat's [[father]], Siddiqui, comes to take her back, she tells him that she is married to Nabeel to stop him. When Nabeel's mother, Mumtaz, comes to visit him, he says that Khoobsoorat is the housemaid, as his mother would not accept his living together with a woman.\n\nLater in the series, Khubsoorat's [[father]] finds out his daughter is unmarried and informs her that he is coming to take her back home. Nabeel's mother comes to visit her son and tells him that Khoobsoorat is a good girl and that they should get married. When she asks Khubsoorat, Khubsoorat is shocked and decides to leave. Later, Nabeel tells Khoobsoorat that he really loves her and had fallen in love with her when he saw her for the fourth time (''chothi nazar main''); and, so, he wants to marry her. Mehmood and Mumtaz started to like each other and want to get married. At Nabeel and Khubsoorat's marriage, after their ''[[nikah]]'' is read, Nabeel wishes Mehmood could also marry someone along with him on the same day and place, to his suprise, Mehmood replies that he has already decided a wife. Mehmood announces he will marry Mumtaz and tells the ''[[qadi]]'' to wait and read their nikah as well. Nabeel is shocked by this and feels very uncomfortable about his mother being close to Mehmood. At this moment, Siddiqui arrives to cancel his daughter's wedding. Nabeel informs him that the nikah is already read, and he gets very mad, for letting his daughter marry such a wrongful man. Meantime, Butt sahb enters the scene, demanding to stop the marriage as it is not legal to marry after 12. Siddiqui gives money to dismiss Butt sahb.\n\n====Episode 26-82 (After marriage)====\n(Nabeel's mother becomes a regular cast member after episode 25.)\n\nSoon after the couples get married, Nabeel gets a call from Ahmad, who tells him he has found someone who will move into the apartment, and that they have two days to move out. Luckily, Khubsoorat's father arranges for a new place for them to live and pays in advance, so that they do not struggle. \n\nSiddiqui also finds a good job offer for Nabeel. Nabeel is forced to attend the job interview by his wife Khoobsurat. Nabeel later gets declined due to his demanding of a salary of 3-4 lakhs, saying he is made for much bigger things and will not work for anyone who does not see his true potential.\n\n====Episode 83-87 (Bubulay in Dubai)====\nThe Bulbulay family goes to Dubai but without telling each other. Nabeel and Khoobsurat win a trip to Dubai from a lucky draw. Mehmood and Mumtaz go to Dubai for their honeymoon, with their own money. They happen to be booked into the same hotel. While walking in the hall, Nabeel and Mehmood bump into each other; they pretend that they don't know each other and rush back to their rooms. When both families have plans to go to the Oasis Mall, and both Mehmood and Nabeel are taking showers in their rooms, Khoobsurat and Momo wait for them in the hotel lobby and see each other clearly. \n\nMomo goes out of the hotel to avoid Khoobsurat and rushes off in a taxi to the mall.  Khoobsurat, Nabeel, and Mehmood go out to find her. After they're reunited, they go to Ibn Battuta Mall the next day, where they meet FM radio producers and are offered jobs that don't work out. Nabeel later meets a woman and starts flirting with her, and convincing her that he is rich, having many businesses. Mehmood sab finds out, and tries to stop Nabeel but backfires. Afterward, the family headed towards the mall, Nabeel makes up excuses to go back to the hotel, so Mehmood sab drugs Nabeel's coffee cup to ruin his date. Nabeel then returns to the hotel and invites the woman to stay in his hotel room, he kept going to the washroom repeatedly due to the effect of the drug. Khoobsurat returns from the mall and discovers the truth, which later on makes her angry at Nabeel.\n\nThe next day, Momo meets a man in the hotel lounge and mistakenly picks up his bag thinking it's hers. The man was ordered by his boss to follow Momo to get the bag back. Meanwhile, the boss, who the bag had belonged to, finds out that Momo is the leader of the Bulbulay gang so he captures Nabeel, Mehmood, and Khoobsurat, and then blackmail Momo to return the bag in exchange for her gang. The boss then orders the man to capture the bag from her possession, Momo realizing that the bag has cash inside; instead gives a small portion of the money to the man. The boss frees the family thinking the man had received the money. Momo still having possession of the bag tells the family and they immediately rush towards the airport.\n\n====Episode 88-100 (pre-parenthood)====\nWhile returning home from Dubai, Momo loses her bag at the airport.

Westing. (Despite its name, Sunset Towers faces east \u2013 into the sunrise.) Sam Westing was a wealthy [[Businessperson|businessman]] who made his fortune in paper products. He was very patriotic and never smoked, drank, or gambled.\n\nAs the story opens, Barney Northrup is selling apartments to a carefully selected group of tenants. He claims that chess is not allowed in the building. After Sam Westing dies, at the beginning of the book, it emerges that most of the tenants are named as heirs in Westing's will. The will is structured like a puzzle, with the 16 heirs challenged to find the solution. Each of the eight pairs, assigned seemingly at random, is given $10,000 cash and a different set of baffling clues. The pair that solves the mystery will inherit Westing's entire $200 million fortune and control of his company. It is discovered that Berthe Erica Crow is the answer but not the murderer. In the end, unknown to the other players, Turtle Wexler wins the game and inherits Sam Westing's company.\n\n==Characters==\n\n===Pair One===\n* ''' Jake Wexler''' is a  [[podiatrist]], and a bookie on the side. He is married to Grace Wexler, whom he loves, but he also knows that she might never be happy with their life or financial situation. Jake is the father of Angela Wexler and Turtle Wexler.\n*'''Madame Sun Lin Hoo''' is the second and much-younger Chinese immigrant wife of James Shin Hoo. She barely knows how to speak English. She can usually be found cooking in her husband's restaurant. There is a rumor going around Mr. Hoo married her because of her 100-year-old sauce recipe. Although she is an heir, she doesn't contribute to the game.\n\n===Pair Two===\n* '''Tabitha-Ruth Wexler''', known as '''Turtle''' or \"Alice\" to Flora Baumbach, is a highly intelligent 13-year-old girl. She is very protective of her long, dark braid of hair and anyone who touches it gets a kick to the shin. She excels at playing the stock market. She is very fond of both Sandy McSouthers and her partner Flora Baumbach. She has a sister named Angela Wexler, a mother named Grace Windkloppel Wexler and a father named Jake Wexler. Unknown to all else, she secretly wins the game by discovering the fourth identity of Windy Windkloppel/Sam Westing and is given control of his company. She visits him for chess every Sunday from then until his death at 85. It is discovered that she later marries Theo in the epilogue when Julian Eastman asks about her husband. After she turns 18, she requests that everyone call her \"T.R. Wexler\". She admits to being the bomber after the fourth bomb explodes to protect her sister, Angela.\n* '''Flora Baumbach''' is a shy 60-year-old [[dressmaker]] who becomes a maternal figure to her partner, Turtle. Her daughter, Rosalie, had [[Down syndrome]] and died of [[pneumonia]] at age 19. Her husband disappeared, and it is unknown whether he died or if there was a divorce. Flora is kind to everyone and prefers to see the best in people. Turtle refers to her as \"Baba,\" while she refers to Turtle as \"Alice.\" Flora discovers that she is exceptional at braiding hair when she starts braiding Turtle's hair.\n\n===Pair Three===\n* '''Christos \"Chris\" Theodorakis''' is a 15-year-old boy who uses a wheelchair due to degenerative muscle disease. He is very intelligent and enjoys [[birdwatching]]. His brother, Theo, is very protective of him. Chris's disease causes muscle spasms and affects his speech, but he is much more observant than he lets on \u2013 in part because he is often dismissed by others. Chris also develops a temporary friendship with Sydelle Pulaski. In the epilogue, Denton Deere discovers a medication for Chris that helps with his condition.\n* '''Dr. Denton Deere''' is a 25-year-old [[Internship (medicine)|medical intern]]. He is engaged to Angela. He has an obsession with diagnosing those he meets. He is very stuck up, and Turtle calls him a \u201cknow-it-all stuck up marshmallow face\u201d. He is usually kicked by Turtle. However, he gets better as the book progresses.\n\n===Pair Four===\n* '''Judge J.J. Ford''' is an intelligent and serious African-American woman in her forties. She is suspicious of the game created by Sam Westing. Unlike the other heirs, who want to win the game and the fortune, her goal is to discover the past of every heir. She prefers to work on her own, but uses her partner's ear for gossip to her advantage. Her connection to Westing is that she is the daughter of his former servants. Growing up, Westing would play chess with Ford and funded her education. As Sandy, Westing suggested that he did so as he saw her potential instead of pity as she believes.\n* '''Alexander \"Sandy\" McSouthers''' was a 65-year-old [[Doorman (profession)|doorman]] but is also Sam Westing, Barney Northup, Julian R. Eastman, Windy Windkloppel (as discovered at the end of the story) in Sunset Towers. His description says that he previously worked at Westing Paper Products Corporation and claims to have been fired by Sam Westing himself for attempting to organize the workers. McSouthers is notable for his knowledge of Sunset Towers' [[gossip]]. He is exceptionally close to Turtle Wexler.\n\n===Pair Five===\n* '''Grace Windsor Wexler''', married to Jake Wexler and mother of Angela and Turtle, is a self-centered woman who is obsessed with her own image. She favors Angela while largely ignoring Turtle. She claims to be Mr. Westing's niece; her name is actually Gracie Windkloppel Wexler. Grace wants to be an [[interior design]]er. However, as the game goes on, she develops a growing interest in her partner's restaurant and the restaurant business in general.\n* '''James Shin Hoo''' is a middle-aged man, owner of Shin Hoo's restaurant and former [[Entrepreneurship|entrepreneur]], as well as Madame Hoo's husband and Doug's father. He claims Mr. Westing stole his patent for the disposable diaper and appears bitter and moody for this reason. He suffers from [[ulcer]]s, and he can often be seen yelling at his son to study. He also often complains about how Doug is a \"dumb jock\" and incredibly lazy. Victim of the second bomb.\n\n===Pair Six===\n* '''Berthe Erica Crow''', usually referred to as simply '''Crow,''' is an extremely religious 57-year-old woman. She works as a cleaning woman for Sunset Towers, while also operating a downtown soup kitchen for the homeless. She was the wife of Sam Westing and the answer to the game. Her pressuring led to the death of her and Westing's daughter, Violet because she didn't want to marry the man she was betrothed to. She was accused of being the murderer.\n* '''trump''' is an embasill and a 70 years old gold digger in this book\n\n===Pair Seven===\n* '''Theo Theodorakis''' is a smart [[Secondary school|high school]] student, and very loyal to his family. He is protective of his brother Chris and works hard in his parents' [[Coffeehouse|coffee shop]]. He is interested in becoming a writer, and also becomes friends with his partner, Doug Hoo. He has a crush on Angela Wexler. However, in the epilogue, he finds Turtle \"attractive\".\n* '''Doug Hoo,''' son of James Shin Hoo, is a high school track star, one of the best mile-runners in the state. Running is his passion, but his father often criticizes him for not studying enough. He is a prankster and develops a rivalry with Turtle Wexler because he often is pulling her braid and posting mocking notes about her, but he is very close to Theo.\n\n===Pair Eight===\n* '''Angela Wexler''' is a beautiful 20-year-old girl: fair, blonde, and very pretty. She is considered the 'perfect' daughter, often getting more attention than her sister Turtle. However, people only acknowledge her as an attractive object to be married to Dr. Denton Deere, and not an intelligent woman in her own right. She is the one who bombs the building, however, her sister takes the blame and tells her to keep the truth to herself. She was a victim of the third bomb.\n* '''Sydelle Pulaski''' is a mysterious character who seems to have no connection to Mr. Westing or the other heirs. No one pays any attention to her, so she tries hard to be noticed. She seems to have an affinity for Chris Theodorakis. She has a crutch and often decorates and paints it to match her outfit. She is clever and observant, although these traits are often looked over. She is secretary to the president of Schultz's Sausages, Conrad Schultz, who later in the book is her fianc\u00e9.\n\n===Other characters===\n* '''Barney Northrup''' is a mysterious figure who sells all of the apartments in Sunset Towers to the various heirs. At the beginning of the book, it is said he is a good businessman. After this, he is rarely seen by any of the tenants. Barney Northrup is also not a real person. (Sam Westing)\n* '''Julian R. Eastman''' runs Westing Paper Products in Mr. Westing's absence. He was a witness to Mr. Westing's will. (Sam Westing). He is Windy Windkloppel's last identity and dies beside Turtle.\n* '''Dr. Sidney Sikes''' is a good friend of Samuel W. Westing and a witness to his will. Was the one who declared both Westing and Sandy McSouthers (Sam Westing) dead and appears to be in on Westing's plan.\n* '''Edgar Jennings Plum'''  or Ed Plum, is the young and fairly incompetent [[lawyer]] in charge of handling Samuel Westing's estate. Aside from reading Westing's will to the players, Plum has no part in the game. He is seen admiring Angela.\n* '''Mr. and Mrs. Theodorakis''' runs the Sunset Towers coffee shop.  They have no role in the game, even though George Theodorakis was Violet Westing's, first love. Their sons Chris and Theo do participate in the game. Victims of the first bomb.\n\n==Epilogue==\nThe epilogue of the story is told in the book's last three chapters, which depict what happened to the heirs after the game ended, and how it affected them.\n\n* '''Otis Amber''' and '''Crow''' fall in love and marry, leaving their jobs at Sunset Towers to work at Crow's soup kitchen, to which many of the heirs leave donations. Both died within a week of each other.\n* '''Flora Baumbach''' leaves the dressmaking business a few years after the game's conclusion, becoming Turtle's close friend and later Alice's(Angela and Denton's daughter)nanny.\n* '''Denton Deere''' and '''Angela Wexler''' both question their life choices and separate.

However, he remains unable to walk and uses a wheelchair for the rest of his life. His college education is financed by Judge Ford, and he meets a girl named Shirley during his first year. The two later marry and become professors at the local university. Chris discovers and names a new species of parrot (the \"something-Christos parrot\") during an expedition in Central America.\n* '''Sydelle Pulaski''' returns to her old job at Schultz Sausages and discovers that Mr. Schultz has a crush on her. She later marries him. The pair moves to [[Hawaii]], though Sydelle stays in touch with Angela. She gives up using crutches to get attention but requires the use of them on various occasions near the end of the novel.\n* '''Jake Wexler''', dissatisfied with his job as a podiatrist, is recommended to a political position by Judge Ford. He becomes the Chairman of the State Gambling Commission and then the Wisconsin State Crime Commissioner, though the jobs give him little time to spend with his wife.\n* '''Grace Wexler''' takes control of Jimmy Hoo's restaurant, renaming it \"Hoo's on First\" and giving it a theme of local sports stars. It gets rave reviews. The success of \"Hoo's on First\" ultimately results in a chain of ten such restaurants, the latest of which allows her to work close to her husband in the state capital of Madison.\n* '''Theo Theodorakis''' attends a literary college, becoming an assistant to the reporter who writes the article about Doug's first gold medal. He later becomes a novelist. His first novel does not sell well, but at the book's end, he has almost finished his second book.

Westing. (Despite its name, Sunset Towers faces east \u2013 into the sunrise.) Sam Westing was a wealthy [[Businessperson|businessman]] who made his fortune in paper products. He was very patriotic and never smoked, drank, or gambled.\n\nAs the story opens, Barney Northrup is selling apartments to a carefully selected group of tenants. He claims that chess is not allowed in the building. After Sam Westing dies, at the beginning of the book, it emerges that most of the tenants are named as heirs in Westing's will. The will is structured like a puzzle, with the 16 heirs challenged to find the solution. Each of the eight pairs, assigned seemingly at random, is given $10,000 cash and a different set of baffling clues. The pair that solves the mystery will inherit Westing's entire $200 million fortune and control of his company. It is discovered that Berthe Erica Crow is the answer but not the murderer. In the end, unknown to the other players, Turtle Wexler wins the game and inherits Sam Westing's company.\n\n==Characters==\n\n===Pair One===\n* ''' Jake Wexler''' is a  [[podiatrist]], and a bookie on the side. He is married to Grace Wexler, whom he loves, but he also knows that she might never be happy with their life or financial situation. Jake is the father of Angela Wexler and Turtle Wexler.\n*'''Madame Sun Lin Hoo''' is the second and much-younger Chinese immigrant wife of James Shin Hoo. She barely knows how to speak English. She can usually be found cooking in her husband's restaurant. There is a rumor going around Mr. Hoo married her because of her 100-year-old sauce recipe. Although she is an heir, she doesn't contribute to the game.\n\n===Pair Two===\n* '''Tabitha-Ruth Wexler''', known as '''Turtle''' or \"Alice\" to Flora Baumbach, is a highly intelligent 13-year-old girl. She is very protective of her long, dark braid of hair and anyone who touches it gets a kick to the shin. She excels at playing the stock market. She is very fond of both Sandy McSouthers and her partner Flora Baumbach. She has a sister named Angela Wexler, a mother named Grace Windkloppel Wexler and a father named Jake Wexler. Unknown to all else, she secretly wins the game by discovering the fourth identity of Windy Windkloppel/Sam Westing and is given control of his company. She visits him for chess every Sunday from then until his death at 85. It is discovered that she later marries Theo in the epilogue when Julian Eastman asks about her husband. After she turns 18, she requests that everyone call her \"T.R. Wexler\". She admits to being the bomber after the fourth bomb explodes to protect her sister, Angela.\n* '''Flora Baumbach''' is a shy 60-year-old [[dressmaker]] who becomes a maternal figure to her partner, Turtle. Her daughter, Rosalie, had [[Down syndrome]] and died of [[pneumonia]] at age 19. Her husband disappeared, and it is unknown whether he died or if there was a divorce. Flora is kind to everyone and prefers to see the best in people. Turtle refers to her as \"Baba,\" while she refers to Turtle as \"Alice.\" Flora discovers that she is exceptional at braiding hair when she starts braiding Turtle's hair.\n\n===Pair Three===\n* '''Christos \"Chris\" Theodorakis''' is a 15-year-old boy who uses a wheelchair due to degenerative muscle disease. He is very intelligent and enjoys [[birdwatching]]. His brother, Theo, is very protective of him. Chris's disease causes muscle spasms and affects his speech, but he is much more observant than he lets on \u2013 in part because he is often dismissed by others. Chris also develops a temporary friendship with Sydelle Pulaski. In the epilogue, Denton Deere discovers a medication for Chris that helps with his condition.\n* '''Dr. Denton Deere''' is a 25-year-old [[Internship (medicine)|medical intern]]. He is engaged to Angela. He has an obsession with diagnosing those he meets. He is very stuck up, and Turtle calls him a \u201cknow-it-all stuck up marshmallow face\u201d. He is usually kicked by Turtle. However, he gets better as the book progresses.\n\n===Pair Four===\n* '''Judge J.J. Ford''' is an intelligent and serious African-American woman in her forties. She is suspicious of the game created by Sam Westing. Unlike the other heirs, who want to win the game and the fortune, her goal is to discover the past of every heir. She prefers to work on her own, but uses her partner's ear for gossip to her advantage. Her connection to Westing is that she is the daughter of his former servants. Growing up, Westing would play chess with Ford and funded her education. As Sandy, Westing suggested that he did so as he saw her potential instead of pity as she believes.\n* '''Alexander \"Sandy\" McSouthers''' was a 65-year-old [[Doorman (profession)|doorman]] but is also Sam Westing, Barney Northup, Julian R. Eastman, Windy Windkloppel (as discovered at the end of the story) in Sunset Towers. His description says that he previously worked at Westing Paper Products Corporation and claims to have been fired by Sam Westing himself for attempting to organize the workers. McSouthers is notable for his knowledge of Sunset Towers' [[gossip]]. He is exceptionally close to Turtle Wexler.\n\n===Pair Five===\n* '''Grace Windsor Wexler''', married to Jake Wexler and mother of Angela and Turtle, is a self-centered woman who is obsessed with her own image. She favors Angela while largely ignoring Turtle. She claims to be Mr. Westing's niece; her name is actually Gracie Windkloppel Wexler. Grace wants to be an [[interior design]]er. However, as the game goes on, she develops a growing interest in her partner's restaurant and the restaurant business in general.\n* '''James Shin Hoo''' is a middle-aged man, owner of Shin Hoo's restaurant and former [[Entrepreneurship|entrepreneur]], as well as Madame Hoo's husband and Doug's father. He claims Mr. Westing stole his patent for the disposable diaper and appears bitter and moody for this reason. He suffers from [[ulcer]]s, and he can often be seen yelling at his son to study. He also often complains about how Doug is a \"dumb jock\" and incredibly lazy. Victim of the second bomb.\n\n===Pair Six===\n* '''Berthe Erica Crow''', usually referred to as simply '''Crow,''' is an extremely religious 57-year-old woman. She works as a cleaning woman for Sunset Towers, while also operating a downtown soup kitchen for the homeless. She was the wife of Sam Westing and the answer to the game. Her pressuring led to the death of her and Westing's daughter, Violet because she didn't want to marry the man she was betrothed to. She was accused of being the murderer.\n* '''Otis Amber''' is a 62-year-old \"delivery boy.\" Even outside of the game, he is often seen with Berthe Erica Crow, in part because he assists Berthe with her soup kitchen. At the beginning of the story, he tells the tale of the gruesome bet that a boy once made involving the Westing mansion, which becomes an eerie theme throughout the book, using two words: \"purple waves.\" Near the end, the heirs discover that he was a private investigator hired by Barney Northup to investigate Judge J.J. Ford, George Theodorakis, James Hoo, Grace Windkloppel, Flora Baumbach, and Sybil Pulaski. He is discovered to have married Crow at the end.\n\n===Pair Seven===\n* '''Theo Theodorakis''' is a smart [[Secondary school|high school]] student, and very loyal to his family. He is protective of his brother Chris and works hard in his parents' [[Coffeehouse|coffee shop]]. He is interested in becoming a writer, and also becomes friends with his partner, Doug Hoo. He has a crush on Angela Wexler. However, in the epilogue, he finds Turtle \"attractive\".\n* '''Doug Hoo,''' son of James Shin Hoo, is a high school track star, one of the best mile-runners in the state. Running is his passion, but his father often criticizes him for not studying enough. He is a prankster and develops a rivalry with Turtle Wexler because he often is pulling her braid and posting mocking notes about her, but he is very close to Theo.\n\n===Pair Eight===\n* '''Angela Wexler''' is a beautiful 20-year-old girl: fair, blonde, and very pretty. She is considered the 'perfect' daughter, often getting more attention than her sister Turtle. However, people only acknowledge her as an attractive object to be married to Dr. Denton Deere, and not an intelligent woman in her own right. She is the one who bombs the building, however, her sister takes the blame and tells her to keep the truth to herself. She was a victim of the third bomb.\n* '''Sydelle Pulaski''' is a mysterious character who seems to have no connection to Mr. Westing or the other heirs. No one pays any attention to her, so she tries hard to be noticed. She seems to have an affinity for Chris Theodorakis. She has a crutch and often decorates and paints it to match her outfit. She is clever and observant, although these traits are often looked over. She is secretary to the president of Schultz's Sausages, Conrad Schultz, who later in the book is her fianc\u00e9.\n\n===Other characters===\n* '''Barney Northrup''' is a mysterious figure who sells all of the apartments in Sunset Towers to the various heirs. At the beginning of the book, it is said he is a good businessman. After this, he is rarely seen by any of the tenants. Barney Northrup is also not a real person. (Sam Westing)\n* '''Julian R.

He is Windy Windkloppel's last identity and dies beside Turtle.\n* '''Dr. Sidney Sikes''' is a good friend of Samuel W. Westing and a witness to his will. Was the one who declared both Westing and Sandy McSouthers (Sam Westing) dead and appears to be in on Westing's plan.\n* '''Edgar Jennings Plum'''  or Ed Plum, is the young and fairly incompetent [[lawyer]] in charge of handling Samuel Westing's estate. Aside from reading Westing's will to the players, Plum has no part in the game. He is seen admiring Angela.\n* '''Mr. and Mrs. Theodorakis''' runs the Sunset Towers coffee shop.  They have no role in the game, even though George Theodorakis was Violet Westing's, first love. Their sons Chris and Theo do participate in the game. Victims of the first bomb.\n\n==Epilogue==\nThe epilogue of the story is told in the book's last three chapters, which depict what happened to the heirs after the game ended, and how it affected them.\n\n* '''Otis Amber''' and '''Crow''' fall in love and marry, leaving their jobs at Sunset Towers to work at Crow's soup kitchen, to which many of the heirs leave donations. Both died within a week of each other.\n* '''Flora Baumbach''' leaves the dressmaking business a few years after the game's conclusion, becoming Turtle's close friend and later Alice's(Angela and Denton's daughter)nanny.\n* '''Denton Deere''' and '''Angela Wexler''' both question their life choices and separate.

The two later marry and become professors at the local university.

She later marries him. The pair moves to [[Hawaii]], though Sydelle stays in touch with Angela.

He was appointed as the first Chief Engineer to the [[Northern Lighthouse Board]] in 1786.\n\n==Early life==\n\nSmith was born in [[Broughty Ferry]] near [[Dundee]] on 6 December 1752. His father, a [[Sea captain|skipper]], drowned in Dundee harbour while Thomas was still young. As a result, his mother encouraged him towards a career onshore, leading him initially into [[ironmongery]]. While his widowed mother remained in Broughty Ferry, Smith went on to establish himself in [[Edinburgh]].<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.gutenberg.org/files/30990/30990-h/30990-h.htm#page34|title=The Project Gutenberg eBook of the Works of Robert Louis Stevenson Volume XVI, by Robert Louis Stevenson.|website=www.gutenberg.org|access-date=2020-04-25}}</ref>\n\n== Professional career ==\nIn Edinburgh Smith founded and appears to have been the sole proprietor of a successful business in lamps and oils called the Greenside Company\u2019s Works.<ref name=\":0\" /> Smith won a contract to provide improved street lighting for Edinburgh\u2019s burgeoning [[New Town, Edinburgh|New Town]]. \n\nThe [[Oil lamp|oil lamps]] he provided featured [[Parabolic reflector|parabolic reflectors]] made from burnished copper, which concentrated the light and enhanced its brightness.

He was commissioned to build the first four modern lighthouses and promptly dispatched south to pick-up technical expertise from an English lighthouse builder (possibly [[John Smeaton]], who built the pioneering third [[Eddystone Lighthouse]] in the 1750s, or perhaps Ezekiel Walker or [[William Hutchinson (privateer)|William Hutchinson]]).<ref name=\":2\" />\n\nUpon his return Smith set about the construction of the four new lighthouses at [[Kinnaird Head Lighthouse|Kinnaird Head]], [[Mull of Kintyre]], [[Eilean Glas, Scalpay|Eilean Glas]], and [[North Ronaldsay]]. As well as the design and construction, Smith had to overcome significant financial, logistical and supply-chain challenges resulting from the remote locations of the projects.<ref name=\":0\" /> Nonetheless, all four lighthouses were successfully constructed. \n\nSmith quickly adopted the newly invented [[Argand lamp]], which with its circular wick and glass chimney gave a much brighter light than traditional wick lamps. Most significantly, he combined this with his parabolic reflectors resulting in a combination which came to be known as the [[Catoptrics|catoptric system]] and set the standard for lighthouse illumination at that time.<ref name=\":1\" /><ref>{{Cite book|last=NANCOLLAS, TOM.|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/1078162393|title=SEASHAKEN HOUSES : a lighthouse history from eddystone to fastnet.|date=2019|publisher=PENGUIN Books|isbn=1-84614-938-X|location=[Place of publication not identified]|oclc=1078162393}}</ref>\n\nThe first of his lighthouses - Kinnaird Head (1787) - had 17 [[Whale oil|whale-oil]] lamps backed by parabolic reflectors and was said to be the most powerful light of its day<ref name=\":1\" /> with a reported range of 12 to 14 miles (10 to 12 mmi; 19 to 23km). Smith continued to experiment and improve on his designs over the coming years and it was one of his last designs, [[Start Point, Sanday]] (1806), which incorporated a revolving light which was to become universal. \n\nSmith stepped-down from his role with the Northern Lighthouse Board in 1808 and was succeeded by his stepson [[Robert Stevenson (civil engineer)|Robert Stevenson]]. However, he remained active in his private business. \n\n==Family life==\n\nIn 1792 - five years after his appointment to the Northern Lighthouse Board - Smith married his third wife, Jean Lille Stevenson (1751-1820). \n\nPrior to this, Smith had been twice widowed.

He was appointed as the first Chief Engineer to the [[Northern Lighthouse Board]] in 1786.\n\n==Early life==\n\nSmith was born in [[Broughty Ferry]] near [[Dundee]] on 6 December 1752. His father, a [[Sea captain|skipper]], drowned in Dundee harbour while Thomas was still young. As a result, his mother encouraged him towards a career onshore, leading him initially into [[ironmongery]]. While his widowed mother remained in Broughty Ferry, Smith went on to establish himself in [[Edinburgh]].<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.gutenberg.org/files/30990/30990-h/30990-h.htm#page34|title=The Project Gutenberg eBook of the Works of Robert Louis Stevenson Volume XVI, by Robert Louis Stevenson.|website=www.gutenberg.org|access-date=2020-04-25}}</ref>\n\n== Professional career ==\nIn Edinburgh Smith founded and appears to have been the sole proprietor of a successful business in lamps and oils called the Greenside Company\u2019s Works.<ref name=\":0\" /> Smith won a contract to provide improved street lighting for Edinburgh\u2019s burgeoning [[New Town, Edinburgh|New Town]]. \n\nThe [[Oil lamp|oil lamps]] he provided featured [[Parabolic reflector|parabolic reflectors]] made from burnished copper, which concentrated the light and enhanced its brightness. Manufacturing such reflectors within tight tolerances was not straightforward,<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite book|last=Grant, R.

He was commissioned to build the first four modern lighthouses and promptly dispatched to south to pick-up technical expertise from an English lighthouse builder (possibly [[John Smeaton]], who built the pioneering third [[Eddystone Lighthouse]] in the 1750s, or perhaps Ezekiel Walker or [[William Hutchinson (privateer)|William Hutchinson]]).<ref name=\":2\" />\n\nUpon his return Smith set about the construction of the four new lighthouses at [[Kinnaird Head Lighthouse|Kinnaird Head]], [[Mull of Kintyre]], [[Eilean Glas, Scalpay|Eilean Glas]], and [[North Ronaldsay]]. As well as the design and construction, Smith had to overcome significant financial, logistical and supply-chain challenges resulting from the remote locations of the projects.<ref name=\":0\" /> Nonetheless, all four lighthouses were successfully constructed. \n\nSmith quickly adopted the newly invented [[Argand lamp]], which with its circular wick and glass chimney gave a much brighter light than traditional wick lamps. Most significantly, he combined this with his parabolic reflectors resulting in a combination which came to be known as the [[Catoptrics|catoptric system]] and set the standard for lighthouse illumination at that time.<ref name=\":1\" /><ref>{{Cite book|last=NANCOLLAS, TOM.|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/1078162393|title=SEASHAKEN HOUSES : a lighthouse history from eddystone to fastnet.|date=2019|publisher=PENGUIN Books|isbn=1-84614-938-X|location=[Place of publication not identified]|oclc=1078162393}}</ref>\n\nThe first of his lighthouses - Kinnaird Head (1787) - had 17 [[Whale oil|whale-oil]] lamps backed by parabolic reflectors and was said to be the most powerful light of its day<ref name=\":1\" /> with a reported range of 12 to 14 miles (10 to 12 mmi; 19 to 23km). Smith continued to experiment and improve on his designs over the coming years and it was one of his last designs, [[Start Point, Sanday]] (1806), which incorporated a revolving light which was to become universal. \n\nSmith stepped-down from his role with the Northern Lighthouse Board in 1808 and was succeeded by his stepson [[Robert Stevenson (civil engineer)|Robert Stevenson]]. However, he remained active in his private business. \n\n==Family life==\n\nIn 1792 - five years after his appointment to the Northern Lighthouse Board - Smith married his third wife, Jean Lille Stevenson (1751-1820). \n\nPrior to this, Smith had been twice widowed. He had five children by his first wife, though only a daughter (Jane) and son (James) survived infancy. He had one further daughter (Mary-Anne), by his second wife.\n\nJean Lille Stevenson was herself a widow, with a young son called Robert Stevenson. Her first husband was Alan Stevenson, a partner in a [[West Indies]] sugar trading house in [[Glasgow]] who died of epidemic fever on the island of [[Saint Kitts|St. Christopher]] in the West Indies in 1774 leaving Jean Lille in precarious financial circumstances.\n\nThe new family initially lived at 1 Blair Street off the [[Royal Mile]] in [[Old Town, Edinburgh|Edinburgh's Old Town]],<ref>Edinburgh Post Office Directory 1790</ref> before moving to the then newly built 2 Baxter's Place at the head of [[Leith Walk]] in 1798/9.<ref>Edinburgh Post Office Directory 1815</ref>\n\nThe relationship between Thomas Smith and his step-son Robert Stevenson proved to be close and admiring.

On each episode, eight contestants compete for a \u00a310,000 prize by picking the correct answers to general knowledge questions, all the while standing on a tower configured for various stunts. Competitors who pick incorrect answers are eliminated from the show in a variety of different ways, usually involving a drop into a large pool of water at the base of the tower. The show made its debut on [[BBC One]] on 10 July 2010 and ended on 28 August 2010. An American version, hosted by [[Jeff Sutphen]], premiered on 21 June 2011.<ref name=ABC/>\n\n==Format==\nThe show's production company, [[Endemol]], describes the show as \"the play-along fun of a glitzy, Saturday night quiz with the full-on adrenaline rush of an extreme stunt show.\"<ref name=Endemol101Ways/> Each episode features eight contestants, with a mix of sexes, ages and backgrounds, competing to be the winner of the \u00a310,000 prize in the UK version (''$50,000 in the US version'').<ref name=BBCPressOffice101Ways/> Contestants are reduced one by one in the first four rounds, attempting to guess the correct answers to a selection of multiple-choice questions. The contestant who chooses the wrong answer will leave the show in spectacular fashion, in one of the ''101 Ways To Leave A Gameshow''. At any time during the first four rounds, a buzzer could sound, which announces the start of the ''Emergency Exit'' round. In this round, contestants are asked a series of questions at random, with the first contestant to give a wrong answer being eliminated. The ''Emergency Exit'' round is not used in the US and Italian versions. In the final round, only three contestants remain (''four contestants in the US version''), who have to answer one last question in an attempt to win the jackpot prize.\n\n==Production==\nThe show was created jointly by Endemol USA and Endemol UK.<ref name=\"weblogs.variety.com\">{{cite news|url=http://weblogs.variety.com/on_the_air/2010/06/first-on-variety-abc-picks-up-pilot-to-101-ways-to-leave-a-game-show.html?query=101+ways|work=Variety|title=First on Variety: ABC picks up pilot to '101 Ways to Leave a Game Show'|accessdate=2013-04-19|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120915013425/http://weblogs.variety.com/on_the_air/2010/06/first-on-variety-abc-picks-up-pilot-to-101-ways-to-leave-a-game-show.html?query=101+ways|archive-date=15 September 2012|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref> It was first produced by the UK division of [[Endemol]] for the [[BBC]]. Like its Saturday night stablemate, ''[[Total Wipeout]]'', the show is filmed entirely at Endemol's filming facility in Benav\u00eddez, approximately 40&nbsp;km Northwest of [[Buenos Aires]], Argentina. Generally, most of the programme is recorded outside, however, studio segments are recorded in a monolithic purpose-built {{convert|100|ft|m}} tall tower, located above the 'exits'.<ref name=BBCPressOffice101Ways/> Studio segments are generally filmed on three different levels, with the '101 Ways To Leave' segments recorded on the Tower's exterior. Some exits from the show are recorded on a disused airfield runway located adjacent to the tower. Most of the exits culminate in the contestant ending up in a large pool of water directly in front of the tower.\n\nThe United States version was filmed at [[Agua Dulce, California]], which is a popular filming location in Northern [[Los Angeles County]].  The site has an active general aviation airfield that was closed down during filming.\n\n==Gameplay==\nIn each of the first four rounds, Nemone reveals the exit method that will be used to dismiss the losing contestant, numbered between 1 and 101. Jones then asks a question and reads as many answers as there are contestants still in the game; all but one of them are correct. After each contestant secretly chooses one answer, all reveal their selections. If any answer is chosen by multiple contestants, a toss-up question on the buzzer is used to determine who gets to keep it, with the others required to select again from the unchosen answers. Further toss-ups are played as needed until all contestants have chosen different answers, at which point they are prepared for the exit. Jones reveals one correct answer at a time until only two contestants are left in jeopardy, then announces the wrong answer. The contestant who chose it is immediately eliminated from the game.\n\nOnce per episode, a buzzer sounds off between rounds to indicate that an \"Emergency Exit\" round must be played. Jones asks a question to one contestant at a time in random order, and the first to miss a question is eliminated.\n\nOnce three contestants remain, the fifth and final round begins, following the same format as the previous four except that the question has only one right answer. The contestant who chooses it wins \u00a310,000, while the other two are dismissed by exit #101, \"The Trap Door\" - being dropped through trapdoors on which they are standing to fall into the water below.\n\n==Exits used on the show==\nA total of 34 different exits were used over the course of the series, including #101 and the Emergency Exit that were common to all episodes.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n!Exit number\n!Name\n!Episode number\n!Round number\n!Description\n|- valign=\"top\"\n|1\n|Balls of Doom\n|1\n|4\n| The contestants stand inside giant hamster balls made of steel tubing, at the top of a ramp that drops off into the pool.

On each episode, eight contestants compete for a \u00a310,000 prize by picking the correct answers to general knowledge questions, all the while standing on a tower configured for various stunts. Competitors who pick incorrect answers are eliminated from the show in a variety of different ways, usually involving a drop into a large pool of water at the base of the tower. The show made its debut on [[BBC One]] on 10 July 2010 and ended on 28 August 2010. An American version, hosted by [[Jeff Sutphen]], premiered on 21 June 2011.<ref name=ABC/>\n\n==Format==\nThe show's production company, [[Endemol]], describes the show as \"the play-along fun of a glitzy, Saturday night quiz with the full-on adrenaline rush of an extreme stunt show.\"<ref name=Endemol101Ways/> Each episode features eight contestants, with a mix of sexes, ages and backgrounds, competing to be the winner of the \u00a310,000 prize in the UK version (''$50,000 in the US version'').<ref name=BBCPressOffice101Ways/> Contestants are reduced one by one in the first four rounds, attempting to guess the correct answers to a selection of multiple-choice questions. The contestant who chooses the wrong answer will leave the show in spectacular fashion, in one of the ''101 Ways To Leave A Gameshow''. At any time during the first four rounds, a buzzer could sound, which announces the start of the ''Emergency Exit'' round. In this round, contestants are asked a series of questions at random, with the first contestant to give a wrong answer being eliminated. The ''Emergency Exit'' round is not used in the US and Italian versions. In the final round, only three contestants remain (''four contestants in the US version''), who have to answer one last question in an attempt to win the jackpot prize.\n\n==Production==\nThe show was created jointly by Endemol USA and Endemol UK.<ref name=\"weblogs.variety.com\">{{cite news|url=http://weblogs.variety.com/on_the_air/2010/06/first-on-variety-abc-picks-up-pilot-to-101-ways-to-leave-a-game-show.html?query=101+ways|work=Variety|title=First on Variety: ABC picks up pilot to '101 Ways to Leave a Game Show'|accessdate=2013-04-19|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120915013425/http://weblogs.variety.com/on_the_air/2010/06/first-on-variety-abc-picks-up-pilot-to-101-ways-to-leave-a-game-show.html?query=101+ways|archive-date=15 September 2012|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref> It was first produced by the UK division of [[Endemol]] for the [[BBC]]. Like its Saturday night stablemate, ''[[Total Wipeout]]'', the show is filmed entirely at Endemol's filming facility in Benav\u00eddez, approximately 40&nbsp;km Northwest of [[Buenos Aires]], Argentina. Generally, most of the programme is recorded outside, however, studio segments are recorded in a monolithic purpose-built {{convert|100|ft|m}} tall tower, located above the 'exits'.<ref name=BBCPressOffice101Ways/> Studio segments are generally filmed on three different levels, with the '101 Ways To Leave' segments recorded on the Tower's exterior. Some exits from the show are recorded on a disused airfield runway located adjacent to the tower. Most of the exits culminate in the contestant ending up in a large pool of water directly in front of the tower.\n\nThe United States version was filmed at [[Agua Dulce, California]], which is a popular filming location in Northern [[Los Angeles County]].  The site has an active general aviation airfield that was closed down during filming.\n\n==Gameplay==\nIn each of the first four rounds, Nemone reveals the exit method that will be used to dismiss the losing contestant, numbered between 1 and 101. Jones then asks a question and reads as many answers as there are contestants still in the game; all but one of them are correct. After each contestant secretly chooses one answer, all reveal their selections. If any answer is chosen by multiple contestants, a toss-up question on the buzzer is used to determine who gets to keep it, with the others required to select again from the unchosen answers. Further toss-ups are played as needed until all contestants have chosen different answers, at which point they are prepared for the exit. Jones reveals one correct answer at a time until only two contestants are left in jeopardy, then announces the wrong answer. The contestant who chose it is immediately eliminated from the game.\n\nOnce per episode, a buzzer sounds off between rounds to indicate that an \"Emergency Exit\" round must be played. Jones asks a question to one contestant at a time in random order, and the first to miss a question is eliminated.\n\nOnce three contestants remain, the fifth and final round begins, following the same format as the previous four except that the question has only one right answer. The contestant who chooses it wins \u00a310,000, while the other two are dismissed by exit #101, \"The Trap Door\" - being dropped through trapdoors on which they are standing to fall into the water below.\n\n==Exits used on the show==\nA total of 34 different exits were used over the course of the series, including #101 and the Emergency Exit that were common to all episodes.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n!Exit number\n!Name\n!Episode number\n!Round number\n!Description\n|- valign=\"top\"\n|1\n|Balls of Doom\n|1\n|4\n| The contestants stand inside giant hamster balls made of steel tubing, at the top of a ramp that drops off into the pool.

One source of income was derived from pilgrims to the holy town of Gaya: he was entitled to 10 per cent of the fees charged to them, although in common with other major landlords he was also expected to patronise religious festivals and provide financial support for things such as temple maintenance.{{sfnp|Yang|1999|p=120|ps=}} His house in Patna was the location of [[Patna High School]] from 1835.{{sfnp|Bakshi|Chaturvedi|2007|p=283|ps=}} He died in 1841 and was succeeded by his eldest son, Hit Narain Singh, who had been born in 1801.{{sfnp|Chaudhary|1980|ps=}}\n\nThe British allowed Hit Narain Singh to use the title of Maharajah, along with its symbols. He was inclined towards religion and became an [[ascetic]], leaving his wife to administrate his extensive properties.{{sfnp|Yang|1999|p=140|ps=}} His wife in turn transferred it to her daughter, Maharani Rajroop Kuar, under the terms of a will dated 29 October 1877.{{sfnp|Chaudhary|1980|ps=}}\n\nThe Maharani's public works included construction of a temple at Patna at a cost of more than a lakh of rupees, and construction of another and also a large building adjoining it at [[Vrindavan]]. She also spent a large sum of money feeding and assisting famine-stricken people.{{sfnp|Chaudhary|1980|ps=}}\n\nMaharaja Ram Kishan Singh, the adopted son of [[Maharaja Hit Narain Singh]], succeeded him after his death in 1861 and died in 1871.{{sfnp|Chaudhary|1980|ps=}}\n\nWith the abolition of the zamindari system in 1950, disputes arose regarding the estate, as also happened in other areas of Bihar. There were eruptions of violence involving the Bhumihar people on the one hand and members of the [[Dalit]], [[Yadav]] and [[Gareri]] communities on the other, most notably the beheading of a Bhumihar in 1979 that was followed by reciprocal raids on villages a few months later.{{sfnp|Berger|Heidemann|2013|p=50|ps=}}\n\n==Contribution in social and cultural spheres==\nThe Tekari family made large contributions in the social and cultural spheres of the area. The present day Tekari Raj High School and Tekari College owe their existence to their benevolence, while thehe Gaya Public Library (the oldest District Library in Bihar) and the Gaya Club, which is the hub of social activity in Gaya town, stand on land donated by them.<ref name=\"Srivastava 2010\" />\n\nRam Kishan Singh spent money on various public works, including 60,000 rupees on a temple at [[Dharmasala, Gaya|Dharmasala]] and a further 100,000 for one at [[Ayodhya]]. He also gave Rs. 10,000 for road improvements in 1869 and a similar sum for famine relief in 1874.{{clarify|reason=makes no sense - he died in 1871 according to a paragraph above|date=September 2016}} Rs. 2000 was given to [[Patna College]] and much land was given for roads and construction of buildings at [[Patna Hospital]].{{sfnp|Chaudhary|1980|ps=}}\n\nRam Kishan Singh's widow, Rajroop Kuer, also contributed to public works.{{sfnp|Chaudhary|1980|ps=}}\n*A building for Tikari school - Rs. 5000;\n*Purchased government security for the maintenance of the school - Rs. 30,000;\n*Her relatives, and dependents annual contribution to the school - Rs. 1000;\n*Purchased books for that school through the Collector of Gaya - Rs. 1300;\n*Subscription to the industrial school at [[Bankipore]] in commemoration of the visit of the [[Prince of Wales]] - Rs. 10,000;\n*Has established at her cost a Pathshala in every large mauzah in her zamindari;\n*A new dispensary at Tikari in honour of Her Majesty's [[Queen Victoria]] Assumption of the title, [[Empress of India]] under the name ''\"the Empress Dispensary Tikaree\"'' - Rs. 30,000;\n*A building for the above dispensary - Rs. 6400;\n*Annual subscription to [[Alipore Zoological Gardens|Calcutta Zoological Garden]] - Rs. 5000;\n*Annual subscription to [[Great Famine of 1876\u201378|Madras famine]] - Rs. 1050;\n*Annual subscription for repairs of road between Tekari and [[Fatehpur, Bihar|Fatehpur]] - Rs. 16000;\n*Construction and repair of ghat and tank at [[Masaudhi]] and designed with Government's sanction \"Temple's Pond\" - Rs. 13,000;\n*Gives alms, relief, cash, clothing to the poor at Tekari to nearly 200 persons everyday.\n\n==References==\n{{refbegin}}\n'''Citations'''\n{{Reflist}}\n'''Bibliography'''\n*{{citation |editor1-first=S.

The club was founded in 1945 and was named after [[Jovan Miki\u0107 Spartak]], the leader of the [[Partisans (Yugoslavia)|Partisans]] in [[Subotica]], who was a national hero and was killed in 1944. The club was named Spartak Subotica until the end of the 2007\u201308 [[Serbian League Vojvodina]] season when it was merged with ''[[FK Zlatibor Voda|Zlatibor Voda]]'' who won promotion to the [[Serbian First League]] thus gaining the name '''Spartak Zlatibor Voda'''. In 2013, the board decided to return the original name of the club: ''\"FK Spartak Subotica.\"''\n\n==History==\nFounded in 1945, FK Spartak Subotica is, after [[FK Vojvodina|Vojvodina]], the most successful club in northern Serbia. They participated in the first after-war club championship, in the [[1946\u201347 Yugoslav First League]] and from then on, they played always in between the first and second national leagues. The biggest success of the club was achieved when the club played in the 1993\u201394 FR Yugoslavia Cup final against [[FK Partizan|Partizan]] (1\u20136 loss).\n\nAfter the dissolution of [[\u017dAK Subotica]], club that played in the pre-war period until 1945, the players who did not want to belong to any of the two newly formed clubs, Radni\u010dki or Gra\u0111anski, decided to form the FK Spartak. The new club was named after the nickname of a legendary Subotica athlete and World War II commander Jovan Miki\u0107 \u2013 Spartak. The club was very active in its early years, continuing the tradition of Subotica football. Many club players later played for the biggest clubs in the country or internationally, having some played for the national team, as well.  Beside the players, the stadium, the colors and the fans, Spartak also inherited from \u017dAK the tradition of being backed by the [[Yugoslav Railways]].<ref>[http://www.gradsubotica.co.rs/otkud-ime-plavi-golubovi-i-blue-marines/#comment-20844 gradsubotica.co.rs] {{in lang|sr}}</ref>\n\n==Supporters==\n{{main|Marinci (football supporters)}}\nSpartak's fans are known as [[Marinci (football supporters)|Marinci]] (Marines), which were formed in early 1989.\n\n==Stadium==\n{{main|Subotica City Stadium}}\n'''Subotica City Stadium''' (Gradski stadion<ref>[http://www.srpskistadioni.in.rs/superliga/fkspartak_zlatiborvoda-subotica.html FK Spartak ZV] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120422184629/http://www.srpskistadioni.in.rs/superliga/fkspartak_zlatiborvoda-subotica.html |date=22 April 2012 }} at srpskistadioni.in.rs</ref>) is a multi-use [[stadium]] in [[Subotica]], [[Serbia]]. It is currently used mostly for [[Association football|football]] matches and is the club's home ground since 1945. The stadium holds 13,000 people. There is a football pitch and a registered track for athletics suitable for competitions. One part of the Stadium is covered. There are also two subsidiary football pitches.\n\n==Spartak in Europe==\n\n===Mitropa Cup===\nThe Mitropa Cup, officially called the La Coupe de l'Europe Centrale, was one of the first really international major European football cups that the club participated in.

The club was founded in 1945 and was named after [[Jovan Miki\u0107 Spartak]], the leader of the [[Partisans (Yugoslavia)|Partisans]] in [[Subotica]], who was a national hero and was killed in 1944. The club was named Spartak Subotica until the end of the 2007\u201308 [[Serbian League Vojvodina]] season when it was merged with ''[[FK Zlatibor Voda|Zlatibor Voda]]'' who won promotion to the [[Serbian First League]] thus gaining the name '''Spartak Zlatibor Voda'''. In 2013 the board decided to return the original name of the club: ''\"FK Spartak Subotica.\"''\n\n==History==\nFounded in 1945, FK Spartak Subotica is, after [[FK Vojvodina|Vojvodina]], the most successful club in northern Serbia. They participated in the first after-war club championship, in the [[1946\u201347 Yugoslav First League]] and from then on, they played always in between the first and second national leagues. The biggest success of the club was achieved when the club played in the 1993\u201394 FR Yugoslavia Cup final against [[FK Partizan|Partizan]] (1\u20136 loss).\n\nAfter the dissolution of [[\u017dAK Subotica]], club that played in the pre-war period until 1945, the players who did not want to belong to any of the two newly formed clubs, Radni\u010dki or Gra\u0111anski, decided to form the FK Spartak. The new club was named after the nickname of a legendary Subotica athlete and World War II commander Jovan Miki\u0107 \u2013 Spartak. The club was very active in its early years, continuing the tradition of Subotica football. Many club players later played for the biggest clubs in the country or internationally, having some played for the national team, as well.  Beside the players, the stadium, the colors and the fans, Spartak also inherited from \u017dAK the tradition of being backed by the [[Yugoslav Railways]].<ref>[http://www.gradsubotica.co.rs/otkud-ime-plavi-golubovi-i-blue-marines/#comment-20844 gradsubotica.co.rs] {{in lang|sr}}</ref>\n\n==Supporters==\n{{main|Marinci (football supporters)}}\nSpartak's fans are known as [[Marinci (football supporters)|Marinci]] (Marines), which were formed in early 1989.\n\n==Stadium==\n{{main|Subotica City Stadium}}\n'''Subotica City Stadium''' (Gradski stadion<ref>[http://www.srpskistadioni.in.rs/superliga/fkspartak_zlatiborvoda-subotica.html FK Spartak ZV] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120422184629/http://www.srpskistadioni.in.rs/superliga/fkspartak_zlatiborvoda-subotica.html |date=22 April 2012 }} at srpskistadioni.in.rs</ref>) is a multi-use [[stadium]] in [[Subotica]], [[Serbia]].  It is currently used mostly for [[Association football|football]] matches and is the club's home ground since 1945.  The stadium holds 13,000 people.  There is a football pitch and a registered track for athletics suitable for competitions. One part of the Stadium is covered. There are also two subsidiary football pitches.\n\n==Spartak in Europe==\n\n===Mitropa Cup===\nThe Mitropa Cup, officially called the La Coupe de l'Europe Centrale, was one of the first really international major European football cups that the club participated in.

There was a live telethon broadcast on [[BBC One]] and [[BBC Two]] from the evening of 18 March 2011 to early the following morning as well as a number of run-up events. The theme for the Red Nose Day 2011 invited fund-raisers to \"Do Something Funny For Money\".\n\n==Results==\nDonations to Comic Relief's Red Nose Day 2011 reached \u00a374,360,207, the largest total reached on the night in the event's 23-year history. [[Comic Relief]] co-founder [[Richard Curtis]] said: \"This is more than we ever believed we would raise. The generosity of the British public is staggering.\"<ref name=\"fundraising.co.uk\">[http://www.fundraising.co.uk/news/2011/03/19/comic-relief-raises-record-%C2%A374360207-red-nose-day \"Comic Relief raises record \u00a374,360,207 on Red Nose Day\"]</ref>\n\n[[BT Group|BT]] handled 765,777 calls to the donation line during the live TV show.

There was a live telethon broadcast on [[BBC One]] and [[BBC Two]] from the evening of 18 March 2011 to early the following morning as well as a number of run-up events. The theme for the Red Nose Day 2011 invited fund-raisers to \"Do Something Funny For Money\".\n\n==Results==\nDonations to Comic Relief's Red Nose Day 2011 reached \u00a374,360,207, the largest total reached on the night in the event's 23-year history. [[Comic Relief]] co-founder [[Richard Curtis]] said: \"This is more than we ever believed we would raise. The generosity of the British public is staggering.\"<ref name=\"fundraising.co.uk\">[http://www.fundraising.co.uk/news/2011/03/19/comic-relief-raises-record-%C2%A374360207-red-nose-day \"Comic Relief raises record \u00a374,360,207 on Red Nose Day\"]</ref>\n\n[[BT Group|BT]] handled 765,777 calls to the donation line during the live TV show. These reached a peak of 268 calls per second (16,080 calls per minute) at 21.50pm. BT coordinated around 10,000 volunteers at 129 call centres across the UK.<ref name=\"fundraising.co.uk\"/>\n\nThe sum for the 13th Red Nose Day includes:\n* \u00a310,030,984 raised so far by Sainsbury's, itself the biggest single donation ever received on the night of Red Nose Day.\n* \u00a31,375,037 raised by the nine Red Nose Desert Trekkers (Ronni Ancona, Craig David, Lorraine Kelly, Scott Mills, Olly Murs, Dermot O'Leary, Nadia Sawalha, Kara Tointon and Peter White) who all completed a 108 kilometre trek across the Kaisut Desert in northern Kenya.\n* \u00a33,165,705 raised by Radio 1: \u00a3543,284 of this was raised in support of Scott Mills and the Desert Trekkers; and the remaining \u00a32,622,421 was raised by Chris Moyles and Comedy Dave Vitty in their record breaking 52-hour marathon radio broadcast.\nThe Government's Department for International Development (DFID) will match Comic Relief's commitment to spend \u00a310 million improving health and education across Africa.\n\nRed Nose Day typically raises many millions more than the amount raised on the night.
