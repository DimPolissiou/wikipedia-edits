It is the only member of the \"[[catbird]]\" genus '''''Dumetella'''''. Like the [[black catbird]] (''Melanoptila glabrirostris''), it is among the [[Basal (phylogenetics)|basal]] lineages of the Mimidae, probably a closer relative of the [[Caribbean]] [[thrasher]] and [[trembler]] assemblage than of the [[mockingbird]]s and ''[[Toxostoma]]'' thrashers.<ref name=Hunt>{{cite journal|author1=Hunt, Jeffrey S. |author2=Bermingham, Eldredge |author3=Ricklefs, Robert E. |year=2001|title= Molecular systematics and biogeography of Antillean thrashers, tremblers, and mockingbirds (Aves: Mimidae)|journal=[[Auk (journal)|Auk]]|volume=118|issue=1|pages= 35\u201355|doi=10.1642/0004-8038(2001)118[0035:MSABOA]2.0.CO;2|url=http://si-pddr.si.edu/dspace/bitstream/10088/1460/1/Hunt_Bermingham_and_Ricklefs.pdf}}</ref><ref name=Barber>{{cite journal|author1=Barber, Brian R.|author2=Mart\u00ednez-G\u00f3mez, Juan E.|author3=Peterson, A.

His original name ''Muscicapa carolinensis'' reflected the belief, widespread at that time, that the gray catbird was some sort of [[Old World flycatcher]] (presumably due to its remarkably plain coloration, not similar to other mimids).<ref name = Olson1989/>\n\nThe [[genus name]] has a convoluted [[biological nomenclature|nomenclatorial]] history. The [[monotypic]] genus '''''Galeoscoptes''''', proposed by [[Jean Cabanis]] in 1850, was widely used up to 1907. This name roughly means \"capped mockingbird\", from Latin ''galea'' \"helmet\" and [[Ancient Greek]] ''sk\u00f3ptein'' (\u03c3\u03ba\u03ce\u03c0\u03c4\u03b5\u03b9\u03bd, \"to scold\" or \"to mock\"). But as it turned out, ''Dumetella'' was a technically acceptable [[senior synonym]], even though the peculiar circumstances of its publishing left the identity of its author unsolved until 1989. As it turned out, the genus name was published by [[Charles Thorold Wood|C.T. Wood]] in 1837. His description is somewhat eccentric, and was published under his pseudonym \"S.D.W.\". Wood misquotes his source\u2014[[John Latham (ornithologist)|John Latham]]'s 1783 ''General Synopsis of Birds''\u2014as calling the bird \"cat thrush\", probably because he knew the species under that name from [[George Shaw]]'s ''General Zoology''. Latham's name was \"cat flycatcher\", analogous to the [[scientific name]] of Linn\u00e9.<ref name=Glare/><ref name=Olson1989/><ref name=Woodhouse>Woodhouse, S.C. (1910): [https://www.lib.uchicago.edu/efts/Woodhouse/ ''English-Greek Dictionary \u2013 A Vocabulary of the Attic Language'']. George Routledge & Sons Ltd., Broadway House, Ludgate Hill, E.C.</ref>\n\nShaw (and subsequently C.T. Wood) used [[Louis Jean Pierre Vieillot|L.J.P. Vieillot]]'s specific name ''felivox''. This means \"cat voice\", a contraction of Latin ''felis'' (\"cat\") and ''vox'' (\"voice\"). Vieillot, differing from the earlier authors, believed the bird to be a true [[thrush (bird)|thrush]] (''[[Turdus]]'').<ref name=Glare>Glare, P.G.W. (ed.)

In the mid-20th century, the Turdidae and even most of the [[Sylvioidea]] were [[lumpers and splitters|lumped]] in the Muscicapidae\u2014but the Mimidae were not.\n\nLastly, the smaller gray catbirds from [[Bermuda]], which have proportionally narrow and shorter rectrices and primary remiges, were described as [[subspecies]] ''bermudianus'' (\"from Bermuda\") by [[Outram Bangs]] in 1901. But this [[taxon]] was never widely accepted, and today the gray catbird is generally considered monotypic as a species, too.\n\n==Description==\nAdults weigh from {{cvt|23.2|to|56.5|g|oz|1}}, with an average of {{cvt|35|-|40|g|oz}}<ref name = Olson1981/><ref name=\"Cornell\"/> They range in length from {{cvt|20.5|to|24|cm|in}} and span {{cvt|22|to|30|cm|in}} across the wings.<ref name=\"Cornell\">[http://www.allaboutbirds.org/guide/gray_catbird/lifehistory Gray catbird].

The undertail [[Covert (feather)|covert]]s are rust-colored, and the [[remiges]] and rectrices are black, some with white borders. The slim bill, the eyes, and the legs and feet are also blackish. Males and females cannot be distinguished by their looks; different behaviours in the breeding season is usually the only clue to the observer. Juveniles are even plainer in coloration, with [[buff (color)|buff]]y undertail coverts.\n\n===Diet===\n{{unreferenced section|date=June 2017}}\nApproximately 50% of the gray catbird's diet is fruit and berries. They also eat mealworms, earthworms, beetles, and other bugs. In summer, gray catbirds will eat mostly ants, beetles, grasshoppers, caterpillars, and moths. They also eat holly berries, cherries, elderberries, poison ivy, bay, and blackberries.\n\n===Vocalizations===\n[[File:Dumetella carolinensis -Wildwood Preserve Metropark, Toledo, Ohio, USA -calls-8.ogv|left|thumb|Adult voicing cat-like sounds at [[Wildwood Preserve Metropark]], [[Ohio]]]]\nThis species is named for its cat-like call. Like many members of the [[Mimidae]] (most famously [[mockingbirds]]), it also mimics the songs of other birds, as well as those of [[Hylidae]] (tree frogs), and even mechanical sounds. Because of its well-developed [[songbird]] [[Syrinx (biology)|syrinx]], it is able to make two sounds at the same time. The [[alarm call]] resembles the quiet calls of a male [[mallard]].\n\nA gray catbird's song is easily distinguished from that of the [[northern mockingbird]] (''Mimus polyglottos'') or [[brown thrasher]] (''Toxostoma rufum'') because the mockingbird repeats its phrases or \"strophes\" three to four times, the thrasher usually twice, but the catbird sings most phrases only once. The catbird's song is usually described as more raspy and less musical than that of a mockingbird.\n\nIn contrast to the many songbirds that choose a prominent perch from which to sing, the catbird often elects to sing from inside a bush or small tree, where it is obscured from view by the foliage.\n\n==Ecology and behavior==\n\n===Geographical range and habitat===\nNative to most of [[temperate]] North America east of the [[Rocky Mountains]], gray catbirds [[bird migration|migrate]] to the southeastern United States, Mexico, Central America, and the Caribbean in winter; except for the occasional vagrant they always stay east of the [[American Cordillera]]. They are extremely rare vagrants to western Europe. Normally present on the breeding grounds by May, most leave for winter quarters in September/October; as it seems, this species is increasingly extending its stay in the summer range, with some nowadays remaining until mid-winter as far north as Ohio.<ref name=Olson1989>{{cite journal|author=Olson, Storrs L.|year=1989|title= The Original Description and Author of the Genus ''Dumetella'' (Mimidae)|journal=Wilson Bulletin|volume=101|issue=4|pages= 633\u2013637|url=http://sora.unm.edu/sites/default/files/journals/wilson/v101n04/p0633-p0637.pdf}}</ref><ref name=Henninger>{{cite journal|author=Henninger, W.F. |year=1906|title= A preliminary list of the birds of Seneca County, Ohio|journal=[[Wilson Bulletin]]|volume=18|issue=2|pages= 47\u201360|url=http://sora.unm.edu/sites/default/files/journals/wilson/v018n02/p0047-p0060.pdf}}</ref><ref name=OOS>Ohio Ornithological Society (2004): [http://www.ohiobirds.org/publications/OBRClist.pdf Annotated Ohio state checklist] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040718101517/http://www.ohiobirds.org/publications/OBRClist.pdf |date=2004-07-18 }}</ref> The gray catbird is a migratory species.

His original name ''Muscicapa carolinensis'' reflected the belief, widespread at that time, that the gray catbird was some sort of [[Old World flycatcher]] (presumably due to its remarkably plain coloration, not similar to other mimids).<ref name = Olson1989/>\n\nThe [[genus name]] has a convoluted [[biological nomenclature|nomenclatorial]] history. The [[monotypic]] genus '''''Galeoscoptes''''', proposed by [[Jean Cabanis]] in 1850, was widely used up to 1907. This name roughly means \"capped mockingbird\", from Latin ''galea'' \"helmet\" and [[Ancient Greek]] ''sk\u00f3ptein'' (\u03c3\u03ba\u03ce\u03c0\u03c4\u03b5\u03b9\u03bd, \"to scold\" or \"to mock\"). But as it turned out, ''Dumetella'' was a technically acceptable [[senior synonym]], even though the peculiar circumstances of its publishing left the identity of its author unsolved until 1989. As it turned out, the genus name was published by [[Charles Thorold Wood|C.T. Wood]] in 1837. His description is somewhat eccentric, and was published under his pseudonym \"S.D.W.\". Wood misquotes his source\u2014[[John Latham (ornithologist)|John Latham]]'s 1783 ''General Synopsis of Birds''\u2014as calling the bird \"cat thrush\", probably because he knew the species under that name from [[George Shaw]]'s ''General Zoology''. Latham's name was \"cat flycatcher\", analogous to the [[scientific name]] of Linn\u00e9.<ref name=Glare/><ref name=Olson1989/><ref name=Woodhouse>Woodhouse, S.C. (1910): [https://www.lib.uchicago.edu/efts/Woodhouse/ ''English-Greek Dictionary \u2013 A Vocabulary of the Attic Language'']. George Routledge & Sons Ltd., Broadway House, Ludgate Hill, E.C.</ref>\n\nShaw (and subsequently C.T. Wood) used [[Louis Jean Pierre Vieillot|L.J.P. Vieillot]]'s specific name ''felivox''. This means \"cat voice\", a contraction of Latin ''felis'' (\"cat\") and ''vox'' (\"voice\"). Vieillot, differing from the earlier authors, believed the bird to be a true [[thrush (bird)|thrush]] (''[[Turdus]]'').<ref name=Glare>Glare, P.G.W. (ed.)

In the mid-20th century, the Turdidae and even most of the [[Sylvioidea]] were [[lumpers and splitters|lumped]] in the Muscicapidae\u2014but the Mimidae were not.\n\nLastly, the smaller gray catbirds from [[Bermuda]], which have proportionally narrow and shorter rectrices and primary remiges, were described as [[subspecies]] ''bermudianus'' (\"from Bermuda\") by [[Outram Bangs]] in 1901. But this [[taxon]] was never widely accepted, and today the gray catbird is generally considered monotypic as a species, too.\n\n==Description==\nAdults weigh from {{cvt|23.2|to|56.5|g|oz|1}}, with an average of {{cvt|35|-|40|g|oz}}<ref name = Olson1981/><ref name=\"Cornell\"/> They range in length from {{cvt|20.5|to|24|cm|in}} and span {{cvt|22|to|30|cm|in}} across the wings.<ref name=\"Cornell\">[http://www.allaboutbirds.org/guide/gray_catbird/lifehistory Gray catbird].

The undertail [[Covert (feather)|covert]]s are rust-colored, and the [[remiges]] and rectrices are black, some with white borders. The slim bill, the eyes, and the legs and feet are also blackish. Males and females cannot be distinguished by their looks; different behaviours in the breeding season is usually the only clue to the observer. Juveniles are even plainer in coloration, with [[buff (color)|buff]]y undertail coverts.\n\n===Diet===\n{{unreferenced section|date=June 2017}}\nApproximately 50% of the gray catbird's diet is fruit and berries. They also eat mealworms, earthworms, beetles, and other bugs. In summer, gray catbirds will eat mostly ants, beetles, grasshoppers, caterpillars, and moths. They also eat holly berries, cherries, elderberries, poison ivy, bay, and blackberries.\n\n===Vocalizations===\n[[File:Dumetella carolinensis -Wildwood Preserve Metropark, Toledo, Ohio, USA -calls-8.ogv|left|thumb|Adult voicing cat-like sounds at [[Wildwood Preserve Metropark]], [[Ohio]]]]\nThis species is named for its cat-like call. Like many members of the [[Mimidae]] (most famously [[mockingbirds]]), it also mimics the songs of other birds, as well as those of [[Hylidae]] (tree frogs), and even mechanical sounds. Because of its well-developed [[songbird]] [[Syrinx (biology)|syrinx]], it is able to make two sounds at the same time. The [[alarm call]] resembles the quiet calls of a male [[mallard]].\n\nA gray catbird's song is easily distinguished from that of the [[northern mockingbird]] (''Mimus polyglottos'') or [[brown thrasher]] (''Toxostoma rufum'') because the mockingbird repeats its phrases or \"strophes\" three to four times, the thrasher usually twice, but the catbird sings most phrases only once. The catbird's song is usually described as more raspy and less musical than that of a mockingbird.\n\nIn contrast to the many songbirds that choose a prominent perch from which to sing, the catbird often elects to sing from inside a bush or small tree, where it is obscured from view by the foliage.\n\n==Ecology and behavior==\n\n===Geographical range and habitat===\nNative to most of [[temperate]] North America east of the [[Rocky Mountains]], gray catbirds [[bird migration|migrate]] to the southeastern United States, Mexico, Central America, and the Caribbean in winter; except for the occasional vagrant they always stay east of the [[American Cordillera]]. They are extremely rare vagrants to western Europe. Normally present on the breeding grounds by May, most leave for winter quarters in September/October; as it seems, this species is increasingly extending its stay in the summer range, with some nowadays remaining until mid-winter as far north as Ohio.<ref name=Olson1989>{{cite journal|author=Olson, Storrs L.|year=1989|title= The Original Description and Author of the Genus ''Dumetella'' (Mimidae)|journal=Wilson Bulletin|volume=101|issue=4|pages= 633\u2013637|url=http://sora.unm.edu/sites/default/files/journals/wilson/v101n04/p0633-p0637.pdf}}</ref><ref name=Henninger>{{cite journal|author=Henninger, W.F. |year=1906|title= A preliminary list of the birds of Seneca County, Ohio|journal=[[Wilson Bulletin]]|volume=18|issue=2|pages= 47\u201360|url=http://sora.unm.edu/sites/default/files/journals/wilson/v018n02/p0047-p0060.pdf}}</ref><ref name=OOS>Ohio Ornithological Society (2004): [http://www.ohiobirds.org/publications/OBRClist.pdf Annotated Ohio state checklist] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040718101517/http://www.ohiobirds.org/publications/OBRClist.pdf |date=2004-07-18 }}</ref> The gray catbird is a migratory species.

Other elements were invented by Genghis Khan, his generals, and his successors. Technologies useful for attacking fortifications were adapted from other cultures. Foreign technical experts were integrated into the command structure. In many cases, the Mongols defeated significantly larger armies.\n\nTransfer of troops between units was forbidden. The leaders on each level had significant license to execute their orders in the way they considered best. This command structure was highly flexible and allowed the Mongol army to attack ''en masse'', divide into smaller groups to encircle their enemies and either lead them into an ambush or divide into small groups of roughly 10 to mop up a fleeing and broken army. Although they fought as a unit, individual soldiers were responsible for their equipment, weapons, and up to five mounts. Their families and herds would accompany them on foreign expeditions. \n\nStanding above other units was an elite force called [[Kheshig]]. They functioned as imperial guard of the Mongol Empire as well as a training ground for potential young officers. [[Subutai]], a powerful Mongol general, started his career in the Kheshig.\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! Name for military unit size\n!

When one horse became tired, the rider would dismount and rotate to another. Though the used mount would still have to travel, it would do so without the weight of the rider. Their ability to live off the land, and in extreme situations off their animals (mare's milk especially), made their armies far less dependent on the traditional logistical apparatus of agrarian armies. In some cases, as during the invasion of [[Hungary]] in early 1241, they covered up to {{convert|100|mi}} per day, which was unheard of by other armies of the time.\n\nThe mobility of individual soldiers made it possible to send them on successful scouting missions, gathering intelligence about routes and searching for terrain suited to the preferred combat tactics of the Mongols.\n\nDuring the [[Mongol invasion of Kievan Rus']], they used frozen rivers as highways, and winter, the time of year usually off-limits for any major activity due to the intense cold, became the Mongols' preferred time to strike.\n\nTo avoid the deadly hail of missiles, enemies would frequently spread out, or seek cover, breaking up their formations and making them more vulnerable to the lancers' charges. Likewise, when they packed themselves together, into dense square or phalanx style formations, they would become more vulnerable to the arrows.\n\nOnce the enemy was deemed sufficiently weakened, the [[noyans]] would give the order. The drums would beat and the signal flags wave{{citation needed|date=June 2018}}, telling the lancers to begin their charge. Often, the devastation of the arrows was enough to rout an enemy, so the lancers were only needed to help pursue and mop up the remnants. At the [[Battle of Mohi]], the Mongols left open a gap in their ranks, luring the Hungarians into retreating through it. This resulted in the Hungarians being strung out over all the countryside and easy pickings for mounted archers who simply galloped along and picked them off, while the lancers skewered them as they fled.\n\n== Training and discipline ==\n\nMongol armies practiced horsemanship, archery, and unit tactics, formations and rotations over and over again. This training was maintained by a hard, but not overly harsh or unreasonable, discipline.\n\nOfficers and troopers alike were usually given a wide leeway by their superiors in carrying out their orders, so long as the larger objectives of the plan were well served and the orders promptly obeyed. The Mongols thus avoided the pitfalls of overly rigid discipline and [[micromanagement]], which have impeded armed forces throughout history. However, all members had to be unconditionally loyal to each other and to their superiors, and especially to the Khan. If one soldier ran from danger in battle, he and his nine comrades from the same arban would face the death penalty together.\n\n== Cavalry ==\n\n[[File:MongolCavalrymen.jpg|thumb|200px|Mongol cavalry archery from [[Rashid-al-Din Hamadani]]'s [[Jami' al-tawarikh|Universal History]] using the [[Mongol bow]].]]\nSix of every ten Mongol troopers were light cavalry [[horse archer]]s; the remaining four were more heavily armored and armed [[lancers]]. Mongol light cavalry were extremely light troops compared to contemporary standards, allowing them to execute tactics and maneuvers that would have been impractical for a heavier enemy (such as European [[knight]]s). Most of the remaining troops were heavier cavalry with lances for close combat after the archers had brought the enemy into disarray. Soldiers usually carried [[scimitar]]s or [[halberd]]s as well.\n\nThe Mongols protected their horses in the same way as did they themselves, covering them with [[lamellar armor]]. [[Barding|Horse armor]] was divided into five parts and designed to protect every part of the horse, including the forehead, which had a specially crafted plate, which was tied on each side of the neck.<ref name=\"George Lane 2004. p.31\">George Lane. ''Genghis Khan and Mongol Rule.'' Westport, CT: Greenwood, 2004. Print. p.31</ref>\n\n[[Mongolian horse]]s are relatively small, but extremely hardy, self-sufficient and longwinded.{{Citation needed|date=March 2020}}  These horses could survive in climates that would have killed other breeds, enabling the Mongols to launch successful winter attacks on Russia.{{Citation needed|date=March 2020}}  Mongol horses typically do not require a daily supply of grain.  Their ability to forage grass and twigs on their own\u2014and to survive on such fodder\u2014helped free the Khan's army from the need for supply lines.  The Mongol horse has excellent stamina.  In 30&nbsp;km traditional races between Mongol horses and breeds like the Arabian or Thoroughbred, it has been found that the latter are faster, but that Mongol horses are better able to run at length.{{Citation needed|date=March 2020}}  The tireless nature of the Mongol horse meant that it would have stayed fresh longer in battle, granting Genghis Khan's armies an endurance advantage.{{Citation needed|date=March 2020}}\n\nA warrior relied on his herd to provide him with staple foods of milk and meat; hide for bowstrings, shoes, and armor; dried dung to be used as fuel for his fire; hair for rope, battle standards, musical instruments and helmet decorations; milk also used for shamanistic ceremonies to ensure victory; and for hunting and entertainment that often served as military training.  If he died in battle, a horse would sometimes be sacrificed with him to provide a mount for the afterlife.\n\nThe main drawback to Mongol horses was their lack of speed.  They would lose short-distance races under equal conditions with larger horses from other regions. However, since most other armies carried much heavier armor, the Mongols could still outrun most enemy horsemen in battle. In addition, Mongolian horses were extremely durable and sturdy, allowing the Mongols to move over large distances quickly, often surprising enemies that had expected them to arrive days or even weeks later.{{Citation needed|date=March 2020}}\n\nAll horses were equipped with [[stirrup]]s. This technical advantage made it easier for the Mongol archers to turn their upper body, and shoot in all directions, including backwards. Mongol warriors would time the loosing of an arrow to the moment when a galloping horse would have all four feet off the ground, thus ensuring a steady, well-aimed shot.{{Citation needed|date=April 2020}}\n\nEach soldier had two to four horses\u2014so when a horse tired they could change to one of the others. This made them one of the fastest armies in the world, but also made the Mongol army vulnerable to shortages of fodder. Campaigning in arid regions such as Central Asia or forested regions of Southern China were thus difficult and even in ideal steppe terrain, a Mongol force had to keep moving to ensure sufficient grazing for its massive horse herd.\n\n== Logistics ==\n[[File:Mongol hunter with tame cheetah.jpg|thumb|180px|A [[Mongol]] warrior with a [[cheetah]]]]\n\n=== Supply ===\nMongol armies traveled light, and were able to live largely off the land. Their equipment included fish hooks and other tools meant to make each warrior independent of any fixed supply source. The most common travel food of the Mongols was dried and ground meat ''borts'', which remains common in [[Mongolian cuisine]] today. [[Borts]] is light and easy to transport, and can be cooked with water similarly to a modern \"instant soup\".\n\nTo ensure they would always have fresh horses, each trooper usually had 3 or 4 mounts.<ref name=\"All the Khan's Horses\"/> The horse is viewed much like a cow in Mongolia, and is milked and slaughtered for meat as such.  Since most of the Mongols' mounts were mares, they were able to live off their horses' milk or milk products as they moved through enemy territory.  In dire straits, the Mongol warrior could drink some of the blood from his string of remounts. They could survive a whole month on only drinking mare's milk combined with mare's blood.{{citation needed|date=August 2015}}\n\nHeavier equipment was brought up by well organized supply trains. Wagons and carts carried, amongst other things, large stockpiles of arrows. The main logistical factor limiting their advance was finding enough food and water for their animals.  This would lead to serious difficulties during some of the Mongol campaigns, such as [[Mongol invasions of the Levant|their conflicts with the Mamluks]], the arid terrain of [[Syria]] and [[the Levant]] making it difficult for large Mongol armies to penetrate the region, especially given the [[Mamluk]]'s [[scorched earth]] policy of burning grazing lands throughout the region.  It also limited the Mongol ability to exploit their success following the [[Battle of Mohi]], as even the [[Great Hungarian Plain]] was not large enough to provide grazing for all the flocks and herds following Subutai's army permanently.{{citation needed|date=August 2015}}\n\n=== Communications ===\nThe Mongols established a system of postal-relay horse stations called ''[[Yam (route)|\u00d6rt\u00f6\u00f6]]'', similar to the [[Royal Road|system employed in ancient Persia]] for fast transfer of written messages. The Mongol mail system was the first such empire-wide service since the Roman Empire. Additionally, Mongol battlefield communication utilized signal flags and horns and to a lesser extent, signal arrows to communicate movement orders during combat.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Great Armies of Antiquity|last=Gabriel|first=Richard A.|publisher=Praeger Publishers|year=2004|isbn=0275978095|location=|pages=343}}</ref>\n\n==Uniform==\n[[File:DiezAlbumsMountedArchers.jpg|thumb|220px|left|A [[Mongol]] melee in the 13th century.]]\nThe basic uniform of the Mongol fighting man consisted of a heavy coat fastened at the waist by a leather belt. From the belt would hang his sword, dagger, and possibly an axe. This long robe-like coat would double over, left breast over right, and be secured with a button a few inches below the right armpit. The coat was lined with fur. Underneath the coat, a shirt-like undergarment with long, wide sleeves was commonly worn. [[Silk]] and [[metal]]lic thread were increasingly used. The Mongols wore protective heavy silk undershirts. Even if an arrow pierced their mail or leather outer garment, the silk from the undershirt would stretch to wrap itself around the arrow as it entered the body, reducing damage caused by the arrow shaft, and making removal of the arrow easier.\n\nThe boots were made from felt and leather and, though heavy, would be comfortable and wide enough to accommodate the trousers tucked in before being laced tightly. They were heelless, though the soles were thick and lined with fur. Worn with felt socks, the feet were unlikely to get cold.\n\nLamellar armor was worn over the thick coat. The armor was composed of small scales of iron, chain mail, or hard leather sewn together with leather tongs and could weigh {{convert|10|kg}} if made of leather alone and more if the cuirass was made of metal scales. The leather was first softened by boiling and then coated in a crude lacquer made from pitch, which rendered it waterproof.<ref>George Lane - Ibid, p.99</ref> Sometimes the soldier's heavy coat was simply reinforced with metal plates.\n\nHelmets were cone shaped and composed of iron or steel plates of different sizes and included iron-plated neck guards. The Mongol cap was conical in shape and made of quilted material with a large turned-up brim, reversible in winter, and earmuffs. Whether a soldier's helmet was leather or metal depended on his rank and wealth.<ref name=\"George Lane 2004. p.31\"/>\n\n==Weapons==\n[[File:Mongol soldiers by Rashid al-Din 1305.JPG|thumb|Mongol soldiers using bow, in ''[[Jami al-Tawarikh]]'' by Rashid al-Din, 1305\u20131306.]]\n{{See also|Scimitar|Spear|Battle axe}}\n\nMounted archers were a major part of the armies of the [[Mongol Empire]], for instance at the 13th-century [[Battle of Legnica|Battle of Liegnitz]], where an army including 20,000 horse archers defeated a force of 30,000 troops led by [[Henry II the Pious|Henry II]], duke of Silesia, via demoralization and continued harassment.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Hildinger|first1=Erik|title=Mongol Invasions: Battle of Liegnitz|journal=Military History|date=June 1997|url=http://www.historynet.com/mongol-invasions-battle-of-liegnitz.htm|accessdate=28 June 2014}}</ref>\n\n===Mongol bow===\n{{Main|Mongol bow}}\nThe primary weapon of the Mongol forces was their [[composite bow]]s made from [[laminate]]d [[Horn (anatomy)#Human uses of horns|horn]], wood, and [[Sinew#Uses of sinew|sinew]]. The layer of horn is on the inner face as it resists compression, while the layer of sinew is on the outer face as it resists tension. Such bows, with minor variations, had been the main weapon of steppe herdsmen and steppe warriors for over two millennia; Mongols (and many of their subject peoples) were extremely skilled with them. Some were said to be able to hit a bird on the wing. Composite construction allows a powerful and relatively efficient bow to be made small enough that it can be used easily from horseback.<ref name=\"George Lane 2004. p.31\"/>\n\nQuivers containing sixty [[arrow]]s were strapped to the backs of their cavalrymen and to their horses. Mongol archers typically carried 2 to 3 bows (one heavier and intended for dismounted use, the other lighter and used from horseback) that were accompanied by multiple quivers and files for sharpening their arrowheads. These arrowheads were hardened by plunging them in brine after first heating them red hot.<ref>\"Daily Life in the Mongol Empire\", George Lane, (page 102)</ref>\n\nThe Mongols could shoot an arrow over {{convert|200 |m}}. Targeted shots were possible at a range of {{convert|150|or|175|m}}, which determined the optimal tactical approach distance for light [[cavalry]] units. [[Trajectory of a projectile|Ballistic]] shots could hit enemy units (without targeting individual soldiers) at distances of up to {{convert|400|m}}, useful for surprising and scaring troops and horses before beginning the actual attack. Shooting from the back of a moving horse may be more accurate if the arrow is loosed in the phase of the [[Horse gait#Gallop|gallop]] when all four of the horse's feet are off the ground.<ref>Saunders, John Joseph. [https://books.google.co.uk/books?hl=en&lr=&id=nFx3OlrBMpQC&oi=fnd&pg=PR7&dq=mongol+archer&ots=Hga5PJHKmw&sig=aOopo8dMEpx-4uLOilh_q6bRFzE#v=onepage&q=ARCHER&f=false The History of The Mongol Conquests] Univ of Pennsylvania Press, 2001.</ref>\n\nThe Mongols may have also used crossbows (possibly acquired from the Chinese), also both for infantry and cavalry, but these were scarcely ever seen or used in battle. The Manchus forbade archery by their Mongol subjects, and the Mongolian bowmaking tradition was lost during the [[Qing Dynasty]]. The present bowmaking tradition emerged after independence in 1921 and is based on [[Manchu people#Riding and archery|Manchu]] types of bow, somewhat different to the bows known to have been used by the Mongol empire.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.atarn.org/mongolian/mn_nat_arch/mn_nat_arch.htm |title=Mongolian National Archery |author=Munkhtsetseg |date=18 July 2000 |work=INSTINCTIVE ARCHER MAGAZINE |publisher= |accessdate=16 June 2011}}</ref> [[Mounted archery]] had fallen into disuse and has been revived only in the 21st century.\n\n===Sword===\nMongol swords were a slightly curved [[scimitar]], which they used for slashing attacks but could also use to cut and thrust, due to its shape and construction. This made it easier to use from horseback. Warriors could use the sword with a one-handed or two-handed grip. Its blade was usually around {{convert|2.5|ft}} in length, with an overall length of approximately {{convert|1|m}}.\n\n===Gunpowder===\n====Jin dynasty====\nThe first concerted Mongol invasion of Jin occurred in 1211 and total conquest was not accomplished until 1234. In 1232 the Mongols besieged the Jin capital of Kaifeng and deployed gunpowder weapons along with other more conventional siege techniques such as building stockades, watchtowers, trenches, guardhouses, and forcing Chinese captives to haul supplies and fill moats.{{sfn|Andrade|2016|p=45}} Jin scholar Liu Qi (\u5289\u7948) recounts in his memoir, \"the attack against the city walls grew increasingly intense, and bombs rained down as [the enemy] advanced.\"{{sfn|Andrade|2016|p=45}} The Jin defenders also deployed gunpowder bombs as well as fire arrows (''huo jian'' \u706b\u7bad) launched using a type of early solid-propellant rocket.{{sfn|Liang|2006}} Of the bombs, Liu Qi writes, \"From within the walls the defenders responded with a gunpowder bomb called the heaven-shaking-thunder bomb (\u9707\u5929\u96f7). Whenever the [Mongol] troops encountered one, several men at a time would be turned into ashes.\"{{sfn|Andrade|2016|p=45}} A more fact based and clear description of the bomb exists in the ''[[History of Jin]]'': \"The heaven-shaking-thunder bomb is an iron vessel filled with gunpowder. When lighted with fire and shot off, it goes off like a crash of thunder that can be heard for a hundred li [thirty miles], burning an expanse of land more than half a mu [\u6240\u7207\u570d\u534a\u755d\u4e4b\u4e0a, a mu is a sixth of an acre], and the fire can even penetrate iron armor.\"{{sfn|Andrade|2016|p=45}} A Ming official named He Mengchuan would encounter an old cache of these bombs three centuries later in the Xi'an area: \"When I went on official business to Shaanxi Province, I saw on top of Xi'an's city walls an old stockpile of iron bombs. They were called 'heaven-shaking-thunder' bombs, and they were like an enclosed rice bowl with a hole at the top, just big enough to put your finger in. The troops said they hadn't been used for a very long time.\"{{sfn|Andrade|2016|p=45}} Furthermore, he wrote, \"When the powder goes off, the bomb rips open, and the iron pieces fly in all directions. That is how it is able to kill people and horses from far away.\"{{sfn|Andrade|2016|p=46}}\n\nHeaven-shaking-thunder bombs, also known as thunder crash bombs, were utilized prior to the siege in 1231 when a Jin general made use of them in destroying a Mongol warship, but during the siege the Mongols responded by protecting themselves with elaborate screens of thick cowhide. This was effective enough for workers to get right up to the walls to undermine their foundations and excavate protective niches. Jin defenders countered by tying iron cords and attaching them to heaven-shaking-thunder bombs, which were lowered down the walls until they reached the place where the miners worked. The protective leather screens were unable to withstand the explosion, and were penetrated, killing the excavators.{{sfn|Andrade|2016|p=46}} Another weapon the Jin employed was an improved version of the fire lance called the flying fire lance. The ''History of Jin'' provides a detailed description: \"To make the lance, use chi-huang paper, sixteen layers of it for the tube, and make it a bit longer than two feet. Stuff it with willow charcoal, iron fragments, magnet ends, sulfur, white arsenic [probably an error that should mean saltpeter], and other ingredients, and put a fuse to the end. Each troop has hanging on him a little iron pot to keep fire [probably hot coals], and when it's time to do battle, the flames shoot out the front of the lance more than ten feet, and when the gunpowder is depleted, the tube isn't destroyed.\"{{sfn|Andrade|2016|p=46}} While Mongol soldiers typically held a view of disdain toward most Jin weapons, apparently they greatly feared the flying fire lance and heaven-shaking-thunder bomb.{{sfn|Andrade|2016|p=45}} Kaifeng managed to hold out for a year before the Jin emperor fled and the city capitulated. In some cases Jin troops still fought with some success, scoring isolated victories such as when a Jin commander led 450 fire lancers against a Mongol encampment, which was \"completely routed, and three thousand five hundred were drowned.\"{{sfn|Andrade|2016|p=46}} Even after the Jin emperor committed suicide in 1234, one loyalist gathered all the metal he could find in the city he was defending, even gold and silver, and made explosives to lob against the Mongols, but the momentum of the Mongol Empire could not be stopped.{{sfn|Andrade|2016|p46-47}} By 1234, both the Western Xia and Jin dynasty had been conquered.{{sfn|Andrade|2016|p=47}}\n\n====Song dynasty====\nThe Mongol war machine moved south and in 1237 attacked the Song city of Anfeng (modern [[Shouxian]], [[Anhui Province]]) \"using gunpowder bombs [huo pao] to burn the [defensive] towers.\"{{sfn|Andrade|2016|p=47}} These bombs were apparently quite large. \"Several hundred men hurled one bomb, and if it hit the tower it would immediately smash it to pieces.\"{{sfn|Andrade|2016|p=47}} The Song defenders under commander Du Gao (\u675c\u6772) rebuilt the towers and retaliated with their own bombs, which they called the \"Elipao,\" after a famous local pear, probably in reference to the shape of the weapon.{{sfn|Andrade|2016|p=47}} Perhaps as another point of military interest, the account of this battle also mentions that the Anfeng defenders were equipped with a type of small arrow to shoot through eye slits of Mongol armor, as normal arrows were too thick to penetrate.{{sfn|Andrade|2016|p=47}}\n\nBy the mid 13th century, gunpowder weapons had become central to the Song war effort. In 1257 the Song official Li Zengbo was dispatched to inspect frontier city arsenals. Li considered an ideal city arsenal to include several hundred thousand iron bombshells, and also its own production facility to produce at least a couple thousand a month. The results of his tour of the border were severely disappointing and in one arsenal he found \"no more than 85 iron bomb-shells, large and small, 95 fire-arrows, and 105 fire-lances. This is not sufficient for a mere hundred men, let alone a thousand, to use against an attack by the ... barbarians. The government supposedly wants to make preparations for the defense of its fortified cities, and to furnish them with military supplies against the enemy (yet this is all they give us). What chilling indifference!\"{{sfn|Andrade|2016|p=47-48}} Fortunately for the Song, [[M\u00f6ngke Khan]] died in 1259 and the war would not continue until 1269 under the leadership of [[Kublai Khan]], but when it did the Mongols came in full force.\n\nBlocking the Mongols' passage south of the Yangtze were the twin fortress cities of Xiangyang and Fancheng. What resulted was one of the longest sieges the world had ever known, lasting from 1268 to 1273. For the first three years the Song defenders had been able to receive supplies and reinforcements by water, but in 1271 the Mongols set up a full blockade with a formidable navy of their own, isolating the two cities. This didn't prevent the Song from running the supply route anyway, and two men with the surname Zhang did exactly that. The Two Zhangs commanded a hundred paddle wheel boats, travelling by night under the light of lantern fire, but were discovered early on by a Mongol commander. When the Song fleet arrived near the cities, they found the Mongol fleet to have spread themselves out along the entire width of the Yangtze with \"vessels spread out, filling the entire surface of the river, and there was no gap for them to enter.\"{{sfn|Andrade|2016|p=48}} Another defensive measure the Mongols had taken was the construction of a chain, which stretched across the water.{{sfn|Andrade|2016|p=48}} The two fleets engaged in combat and the Song opened fire with fire-lances, fire-bombs, and crossbows. A large number of men died trying to cut through chains, pull up stakes, and hurl bombs, while Song marines fought hand to hand using large axes, and according to the Mongol record, \"on their ships they were up to the ankles in blood.\"{{sfn|Andrade|2016|p=49}} With the rise of dawn, the Song vessels made it to the city walls and the citizens \"leapt up a hundred times in joy.\"{{sfn|Andrade|2016|p=49}} In 1273 the Mongols enlisted the expertise of two Muslim engineers, one from Persia and one from Syria, who helped in the construction of counterweight trebuchets. These new siege weapons had the capability of throwing larger missiles further than the previous traction trebuchets. One account records, \"when the machinery went off the noise shook heaven and earth; every thing that [the missile] hit was broken and destroyed.\"{{sfn|Andrade|2016|p=49}} The fortress city of Xiangyang fell in 1273.{{sfn|Andrade|2016|p=50}}\n\nThe next major battle to feature gunpowder weapons was during a campaign led by the Mongol general Bayan, who commanded an army of around two hundred thousand, consisting of mostly Chinese soldiers. It was probably the largest army the Mongols had ever utilized. Such an army was still unable to successfully storm Song city walls, as seen in the 1274 Siege of Shayang. Thus Bayan waited for the wind to change to a northerly course before ordering his artillerists to begin bombarding the city with molten metal bombs, which caused such a fire that \"the buildings were burned up and the smoke and flames rose up to heaven.\"{{sfn|Andrade|2016|p=50}} Shayang was captured and its inhabitants massacred.{{sfn|Andrade|2016|p=50}}\n\nGunpowder bombs were used again in the 1275 Siege of Changzhou in the latter stages of the Mongol-Song Wars. Upon arriving at the city, Bayan gave the inhabitants an ultimatum: \"if you ... resist us ... we shall drain your carcasses of blood and use them for pillows.\"{{sfn|Andrade|2016|p=50}} This didn't work and the city resisted anyway, so the Mongol army bombarded them with fire bombs before storming the walls, after which followed an immense slaughter claiming the lives of a quarter million.{{sfn|Andrade|2016|p=50}} The war lasted for only another four years during which some remnants of the Song held up last desperate defenses. In 1277, 250 defenders under Lou Qianxia conducted a suicide bombing and set off a huge iron bomb when it became clear defeat was imminent. Of this, the ''History of Song'' writes, \"the noise was like a tremendous thunderclap, shaking the walls and ground, and the smoke filled up the heavens outside.

The entire population was terrified.\"{{sfn|Andrade|2016|p=15}} According to surviving reports, the incident was caused by inexperienced gunpowder makers hired to replace the previous ones, and had been careless while grinding sulfur. A spark caused by the grinding process came into contact with some fire lances which immediately started spewing flames and jetting around \"like frightened snakes.\"{{sfn|Andrade|2016|p=15}} The gunpowder makers did nothing as they found the sight highly amusing, that is until one fire lance burst into a cache of bombs, causing the entire complex to explode. The validity of this report is somewhat questionable, assuming everyone within the immediate vicinity was killed.{{sfn|Andrade|2016|p=15}}\n\n{{quotation|The disaster of the trebuchet bomb arsenal at Weiyang was still more terrible. Formerly the artisan positions were all held by southerners (i.e. the Chinese). But they engaged in peculation, so they had to be dismissed, and all their jobs were given to northerners (probably Mongols, or Chinese who had served them). Unfortunately, these men understood nothing of the handling of chemical substances. Suddenly, one day, while sulphur was being ground fine, it burst into flame, then the (stored) fire-lances caught fire, and flashed hither and thither like frightened snakes. (At first) the workers thought it was funny, laughing and joking, but after a short time the fire got into the bomb store, and then there was a noise like a volcanic eruption and the howling of a storm at sea. The whole city was terrified, thinking that an army was approaching, and panic soon spread among the people, who could not tell whether it was near or far away. Even at a distance of a hundred ''li'' tiles shook and houses trembled. People gave alarms of fire but the troops were held strictly to discipline. The disturbance lasted a whole day and night.\nAfter order had been restored an inspection was made, and it was found that a hundred men of the guards had been blown to bits, beams and pillars had been deft asunder or carried away by the force of the explosion to a distance over ten ''li''. The smooth ground was scooped into craters and trenches more than ten feet deep. Above two hundred families living in the neighbourhood were victims of this unexpected disaster.

The sculptures were completed roughly 250&nbsp;km northwest of [[Chongqing]] by 1128, after the fall of Kaifeng to the Jin dynasty. If the dating is correct this would push back the appearance of the cannon in China by a hundred years more than previously thought.{{sfn|Lu|1988}} The bulbous nature of the cannon is congruous with the earliest hand cannons discovered in China and Europe.\n\nArchaeological samples of the gun, specifically the [[hand cannon]] ([[huochong]]), have been dated starting from the 13th century. The oldest extant gun whose dating is unequivocal is the [[Xanadu Gun]], so called because it was discovered in the ruins of [[Shangdu|Xanadu]], the Mongol summer palace in Inner Mongolia. The Xanadu Gun is 34.7&nbsp;cm in length and weighs 6.2&nbsp;kg. Its dating is based on archaeological context and a straightforward inscription whose era name and year corresponds with the Gregorian Calendar at 1298. Not only does the inscription contain the era name and date, it also includes a serial number and manufacturing information which suggests that gun production had already become systematized, or at least become a somewhat standardized affair by the time of its fabrication. The design of the gun includes axial holes in its rear which some speculate could have been used in a mounting mechanism. Like most early guns with the possible exception of the Western Xia gun, it is small, weighing just over six kilograms and thirty-five centimeters in length.{{sfn|Andrade|2016|p=52-53}} Although the Xanadu Gun is the most precisely dated gun from the 13th century, other extant samples with approximate dating likely predate it.\n\nOne candidate is the [[Heilongjiang hand cannon]], discovered in 1970, and named after the province of its discovery, Heilongjiang, in northeastern China.<ref>Chase, Kenneth Warren (2003).

The [[History of Yuan]] states that a Jurchen commander known as Li Ting led troops armed with hand cannons into battle against Nayan.{{sfn|Needham|1986|p=293-4}}\n\nEven older, the Ningxia gun was found in Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region by collector Meng Jianmin (\u5b5f\u5efa\u6c11). This Yuan dynasty firearm is 34.6&nbsp;cm long, the muzzle 2.6&nbsp;cm in diameter, and weighs 1.55 kilograms. The firearm contains a transcription reading, \"Made by bronzesmith Li Liujing in the year Zhiyuan 8 (\u76f4\u5143), ningzi number 2565\" (\u9285\u5320\u4f5c\u982d\u674e\u516d\u5f91\uff0c\u76f4\u5143\u634c\u5e74\u9020\uff0c\u5be7\u5b57\u4e8c\u4edf\u4f0d\u767e\u9678\u62fe\u4f0d\u865f).{{sf|Andrade|2016|p=329}} Similar to the Xanadu Gun, it bears a serial number 2565, which suggests it may have been part of a series of guns manufactured. While the era name and date corresponds with the Gregorian Calendar at 1271 CE, putting it earlier than both the Heilongjiang Hand Gun as well as the Xanadu Gun, but one of the characters used in the era name is irregular, causing some doubt among scholars on the exact date of production.{{sfn|Andrade|2016|p=329}}\n\nAnother specimen, the [[Wuwei Bronze Cannon]], was discovered in 1980 and may possibly be the oldest as well as largest cannon of the 13th century: a 100 centimeter 108 kilogram bronze cannon discovered in a cellar in [[Wuwei, Gansu|Wuwei]], [[Gansu Province]] containing no inscription, but has been dated by historians to the late Western Xia period between 1214 and 1227. The gun contained an iron ball about nine centimeters in diameter, which is smaller than the muzzle diameter at twelve centimeters, and 0.1 kilograms of gunpowder in it when discovered, meaning that the projectile might have been another co-viative.{{sfn|Andrade|2016|p=53-54}} Ben Sinvany and Dang Shoushan believe that the ball used to be much larger prior to its highly corroded state at the time of discovery.{{sfn|Andrade|2016|p=330}} While large in size, the weapon is noticeably more primitive than later Yuan dynasty guns, and is unevenly cast.

For instance, [[siege engine|siege machine]]s were an important part of Genghis Khan's warfare, especially in attacking fortified cities. The siege engines were not disassembled and carried by horses to be rebuilt at the site of the battle, as was the usual practice with European armies. Instead the Mongol horde would travel with skilled engineers who would build siege engines from scratch from materials on site.\n\nThe engineers building the machines were recruited among captives, mostly from China and Persia, led by a [[Han Chinese|Han]] general [[Guo Kan]]. When Mongols slaughtered the whole population from settlements that resisted or did not surrender, they often spared the engineers and other units, swiftly assimilating them into the Mongol armies.\n\nEngineers in Mongol service displayed a considerable degree of ingenuity and planning; during a siege of a fortified Chinese city, the defenders had taken care to remove all large rocks from the region to deny the Mongols an ammunition supply for their [[trebuchets]], but the Mongol engineers resorted to cutting up logs which they soaked in water to make suitably heavy spheres. During the siege of the [[Order of Assassins|Assassins]]' fortress of [[Alamut Castle|Alamut]] the Mongols gathered large rocks from far and wide, piling them up in depots a day's journey from one another all the way to their siege lines so that a huge supply was available for the breaching batteries operating against the mighty citadel.  The Mongols also scouted the hills around the city to find suitable higher ground on which to mount [[ballista]]s manned by northern Chinese engineers, allowing these to snipe into the interior of the fortress. The Mongols made effective use of the siege technologies developed by their subject peoples; Genghis Khan utilized the Chinese engineers and traction trebuchets he had gained from his victories over the [[Jurchens]] and [[Tanguts]] during his [[Mongol invasion of Khwarezmia and Eastern Iran|Khwarezmian campaign]], while Kublai Khan later called upon Muslim engineers from his [[Il-Khanid|Ilkhanate]] cousins to build counterweight trebuchets that finally concluded the six year [[Battle of Xiangyang|siege of Fancheng and Xiangyang]].\n\n==== Kharash ====\nA commonly used tactic was the use of what was called the \"kharash\". The Mongols would gather prisoners captured in previous battles, and would drive them forward in sieges and battles. These \"shields\" would often take the brunt of enemy arrows and crossbow bolts, thus somewhat protecting the Mongol warriors.<ref>\"Genghis Khan: A Biography\", Zofia Stone</ref> The kharash were also used as assault units to breach walls.\n\n== Strategy ==\n[[File:\u30e2\u30f3\u30b4\u30eb\u578b\u76ae\u93a7.jpg|thumb|100px|Helmet and armor of a [[Mongol]] [[Yuan Dynasty|Yuan]] warrior during the [[Mongol invasion of Japan]]]]\nThe Mongol battlefield tactics were a combination of masterful training with excellent communication and discipline in the chaos of combat. They trained for virtually every possibility, so when it occurred, they could react accordingly. The Mongols also protected their ranking officers well. Their training and discipline allowed them to fight without the need for constant supervision or rallying, which often placed commanders in dangerous positions.\n\nWhenever possible, Mongol commanders found the highest ground available, from which they could make tactical decisions based on the best view of the battlefield as events unfolded. Furthermore, being on high ground allowed their forces to observe commands conveyed by flags more easily than if the ground were level. In addition, keeping the high command on high ground made them easier to defend from sudden attacks and invasions.\n\n=== Intelligence and planning ===\nThe Mongols carefully scouted out and spied on their enemies in advance of any invasion. Prior to the invasion of Europe, Batu and Subutai sent spies for almost ten years into the heart of Europe, making maps of the old Roman roads, establishing trade routes, and determining the level of ability of each principality to resist invasion. They made well-educated guesses as to the willingness of each principality to aid the others, and their ability to resist alone or together. Also, when invading an area, the Mongols would do all that was necessary to completely conquer the town or cities. Some tactics involved diverting rivers from the city/town {{Citation needed|date=May 2010}}, closing supplies to the city and waiting for its inhabitants to surrender, gathering civilians from the nearby areas to fill the front line for the city/town attack before scaling the wall, and pillaging the surrounding area and killing some of the people, then letting some survivors flee to the main city to report their losses to the main populace to weaken resistance, simultaneously draining the resources of the city with the sudden influx of refugees.\n\n=== Psychological warfare and deception ===\n{{Main|Destruction under the Mongol Empire}}\n[[File:Vladimir mongols.jpg|thumb|220px|Drawing of Mongols outside [[Vladimir, Russia|Vladimir]] presumably demanding submission before its sacking.]]\nThe Mongols used [[psychological warfare]] extremely successfully in many of their battles, especially in terms of spreading terror and fear to towns and cities. They often offered an opportunity for the enemy to surrender and pay [[tribute]], instead of having their city ransacked and destroyed. They knew that sedentary populations were not free to flee danger as were nomad populations, and that the destruction of their cities was the worst loss a sedentary population could experience. When cities accepted the offer, they were spared, but were required to support the conquering Mongol army with manpower, supplies, and other services.\n\nIf the offer was refused, however, the Mongols would invade and destroy the city or town, but allow a few civilians to flee and spread terror by reporting their loss. These reports were an essential tool to incite fear in others. However, both sides often had a similar if differently motivated interest in overstating the enormity of the reported events: the Mongols' reputation would increase and the townspeople could use their reports of terror to raise an army. For that reason, specific data (e.g. casualty figures) given in contemporary sources needs to be evaluated carefully.{{fact|date=June 2019}}\n\nThe Mongols also used deception very well in their wars. For instance, when approaching a mobile army the units would be split into three or more army groups, each trying to outflank and surprise their opponents. This created many battlefield scenarios for the opponents where the Mongols would seem to appear out of nowhere and there were seemingly more of them than in actuality. Flanking and/or feigned retreat if the enemy could not be handled easily was one of the most practiced techniques. Other techniques used commonly by the Mongols were completely psychological and were used to entice/lure enemies into vulnerable positions by showing themselves from a hill or some other predetermined locations, then disappearing into the woods or behind hills while the Mongols' flank troops already strategically positioned would appear as if out of nowhere from the left, right and/or from their rear. During the initial states of battlefield contact, while camping in close proximity of their enemies at night, they would feign numerical superiority by ordering each soldier to light at least five fires, which would appear to the enemy scouts and spies that their force was almost five times larger than it actually was.{{fact|date=June 2019}}\n\nAnother way the Mongols used deception and terror was by tying tree branches or leaves behind their horses. They dragged the foliage behind them in a systematic fashion to create dust storms behind hills to appear to the enemy as a much larger attacking army, thereby forcing the enemy to surrender. Because each Mongol soldier had more than one horse, they would let prisoners and civilians ride their horses for a while before the conflict, also to exaggerate their manpower.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://home.arcor.de/mustangace/sca_class_mongols.htm |title=sca_class_mongols |publisher=Home.arcor.de |date= |accessdate=2014-03-07}}</ref>\n\n===Inclusion===\nAs they were conquering new people, the Mongols integrated into their armies the conquered people's men if they had surrendered - willingly or otherwise. Therefore, as they expanded into other areas and conquered other people, their troop numbers increased. Exemplifying this is the [[Siege of Baghdad (1258)|Battle of Baghdad]], during which many diverse people fought under Mongol lordship. Despite this integration, the Mongols were never able to gain long-term loyalty from the settled peoples that they conquered.<ref>Lane, G. (2006). Propaganda. In Daily Life in the Mongol Empire. Westport, Connecticut: Greenwood Publishing Group.</ref>\n\n==Ground tactics==\nThe [[Tumen (unit)|tumens]] would typically advance on a broad front, five lines deep. The first three lines would be composed of horse archers, the last two of lancers. Once an enemy force was located, the Mongols would try to avoid risky or reckless frontal assaults. Instead they would use diversionary attacks to fix the enemy in place, while their main forces sought to outflank or surround the foe. First the horse archers would lay down a barrage of arrow fire. Additional arrows were carried by camels who followed close by, ensuring a plentiful supply of ammunition.{{fact|date=June 2019}}\n\n===Flanking===\n[[File:Battle of Mohi.svg|thumb|250px|Mongols in [[Battle of Mohi]] split into more than three separate formations and one formation under [[Subutai]] flanking the opponent from the right]]\n\nIn all battlefield situations, the troops would be divided into separate formations of 10, 100, 1,000 or 10,000 depending on the requirements. If the number of troops split from the main force was significant, for instance 10,000 or more, these would be handed over to a significant or second-in-command leader, while the main leader concentrated on the front line. The leader of the Mongols would generally issue the tactics used to attack the enemy. For instance the leader might order, upon seeing a city or town, \"500 to the left and 500 to the right\" of the city; those instructions would then be relayed to the relevant 5 units of 100 soldiers, and these would attempt to flank or encircle the town to the left and right.<ref name=\"Mongoltactic\">[https://www.deviantart.com/jwiesner/journal/The-15-Military-Tactics-of-Chinggis-Khan-537500553 The 15 Military Tactics of Chinggis Khan], 5 May 2019</ref>\n\n===Encirclement and opening===\nThe main point of these maneuvers was to encircle the city to cut off escape and overwhelm from both sides. If the situation deteriorated on one of the fronts or flanks, the leader from the hill directed one part of the army to support the other. If it appeared that there was going to be significant loss, the Mongols would retreat to save their troops and would engage the next day, or the next month, after having studied the enemies' tactics and defenses in the first battle, or again send a demand to surrender after inflicting some form of damage. There was no fixture on when or where units should be deployed: it was dependent on battle circumstances, and the flanks and groups had full authority on what to do in the course of battle - such as supporting other flanks or performing an individual [[feigned retreat]] as conditions seemed appropriate, in small groups of 100 to 1000 - so long as the battle unfolded according to the general directive and the opponents were defeated.<ref name=\"Mongoltactic\" />\n\n===Feigned retreat===\nThe Mongols very commonly practiced the [[feigned retreat]], perhaps the most difficult battlefield tactic to execute. This is because a feigned rout amongst untrained troops can often turn into a real rout if an enemy presses into it.<ref>''[[A History of Warfare]]'' - [[John Keegan]]</ref> Pretending disarray and defeat in the heat of the battle, the Mongols would suddenly appear panicked and turn and run, only to pivot when the enemy was drawn out, destroying them at their leisure. As this tactic became better known to the enemy, the Mongols would extend their feigned retreats for days or weeks, to falsely convince the chasers that they were defeated, only to charge back once the enemy again had its guard down or withdrew to join its main formation.<ref name=\"Mongoltactic\" />\n\n==See also==\n*[[Cavalry#Central Asia|Cavalry]] \n*[[Eight Banners]]\n*[[Endemic warfare]]\n*[[Genghis Khan]]\n*[[Horses in East Asian warfare#Mongolia|Horses in East Asian warfare]]\n*[[Mongol Empire]]\n*[[Mounted archery]]\n*[[Timeline of Mongol invasions]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n*Amitai-Preiss, Reuven.

Other elements were invented by Genghis Khan, his generals, and his successors. Technologies useful for attacking fortifications were adapted from other cultures. Foreign technical experts were integrated into the command structure. In many cases, the Mongols defeated significantly larger armies.\n\nTransfer of troops between units was forbidden. The leaders on each level had significant license to execute their orders in the way they considered best. This command structure was highly flexible and allowed the Mongol army to attack ''en masse'', divide into smaller groups to encircle their enemies and either lead them into an ambush or divide into small groups of roughly 10 to mop up a fleeing and broken army. Although they fought as a unit, individual soldiers were responsible for their equipment, weapons, and up to five mounts. Their families and herds would accompany them on foreign expeditions. \n\nStanding above other units was an elite force called [[Kheshig]]. They functioned as imperial guard of the Mongol Empire as well as a training ground for potential young officers. [[Subutai]], a powerful Mongol general, started his career in the Kheshig.\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! Name for military unit size\n!

The right arm is semi-naked because of the hot weather.]]\nEach Mongol soldier typically maintained 3 or 4 [[Mongolian horse|horses]].<ref name=\"All the Khan's Horses\">{{cite web\n|url = http://afe.easia.columbia.edu/mongols/conquests/khans_horses.pdf\n|title = All the Khan's Horses\n|accessdate = 2007-11-21\n|last = Morris\n|first = Rossabi\n|date= October 1994\n|format = PDF\n|page = 2\n}}</ref> Changing horses often allowed them to travel at high speed for days without stopping or wearing out the animals. When one horse became tired, the rider would dismount and rotate to another. Though the used mount would still have to travel, it would do so without the weight of the rider. Their ability to live off the land, and in extreme situations off their animals (mare's milk especially), made their armies far less dependent on the traditional logistical apparatus of agrarian armies. In some cases, as during the invasion of [[Hungary]] in early 1241, they covered up to {{convert|100|mi}} per day, which was unheard of by other armies of the time.\n\nThe mobility of individual soldiers made it possible to send them on successful scouting missions, gathering intelligence about routes and searching for terrain suited to the preferred combat tactics of the Mongols.\n\nDuring the [[Mongol invasion of Kievan Rus']], they used frozen rivers as highways, and winter, the time of year usually off-limits for any major activity due to the intense cold, became the Mongols' preferred time to strike.\n\nTo avoid the deadly hail of missiles, enemies would frequently spread out, or seek cover, breaking up their formations and making them more vulnerable to the lancers' charges. Likewise, when they packed themselves together, into dense square or phalanx style formations, they would become more vulnerable to the arrows.\n\nOnce the enemy was deemed sufficiently weakened, the [[noyans]] would give the order. The drums would beat and the signal flags wave{{citation needed|date=June 2018}}, telling the lancers to begin their charge. Often, the devastation of the arrows was enough to rout an enemy, so the lancers were only needed to help pursue and mop up the remnants. At the [[Battle of Mohi]], the Mongols left open a gap in their ranks, luring the Hungarians into retreating through it. This resulted in the Hungarians being strung out over all the countryside and easy pickings for mounted archers who simply galloped along and picked them off, while the lancers skewered them as they fled.\n\n== Training and discipline ==\n\nMongol armies practiced horsemanship, archery, and unit tactics, formations and rotations over and over again. This training was maintained by a hard, but not overly harsh or unreasonable, discipline.\n\nOfficers and troopers alike were usually given a wide leeway by their superiors in carrying out their orders, so long as the larger objectives of the plan were well served and the orders promptly obeyed. The Mongols thus avoided the pitfalls of overly rigid discipline and [[micromanagement]], which have impeded armed forces throughout history. However, all members had to be unconditionally loyal to each other and to their superiors, and especially to the Khan. If one soldier ran from danger in battle, he and his nine comrades from the same arban would face the death penalty together.\n\n== Cavalry ==\n\n[[File:MongolCavalrymen.jpg|thumb|200px|Mongol cavalry archery from [[Rashid-al-Din Hamadani]]'s [[Jami' al-tawarikh|Universal History]] using the [[Mongol bow]].]]\nSix of every ten Mongol troopers were light cavalry [[horse archer]]s; the remaining four were more heavily armored and armed [[lancers]]. Mongol light cavalry were extremely light troops compared to contemporary standards, allowing them to execute tactics and maneuvers that would have been impractical for a heavier enemy (such as European [[knight]]s). Most of the remaining troops were heavier cavalry with lances for close combat after the archers had brought the enemy into disarray. Soldiers usually carried [[scimitar]]s or [[halberd]]s as well.\n\nThe Mongols protected their horses in the same way as did they themselves, covering them with [[lamellar armor]]. [[Barding|Horse armor]] was divided into five parts and designed to protect every part of the horse, including the forehead, which had a specially crafted plate, which was tied on each side of the neck.<ref name=\"George Lane 2004. p.31\">George Lane. ''Genghis Khan and Mongol Rule.'' Westport, CT: Greenwood, 2004. Print. p.31</ref>\n\n[[Mongolian horse]]s are relatively small, but extremely hardy, self-sufficient and longwinded.{{Citation needed|date=March 2020}}  These horses could survive in climates that would have killed other breeds, enabling the Mongols to launch successful winter attacks on Russia.{{Citation needed|date=March 2020}}  Mongol horses typically do not require a daily supply of grain.  Their ability to forage grass and twigs on their own\u2014and to survive on such fodder\u2014helped free the Khan's army from the need for supply lines.  The Mongol horse has excellent stamina.  In 30&nbsp;km traditional races between Mongol horses and breeds like the Arabian or Thoroughbred, it has been found that the latter are faster, but that Mongol horses are better able to run at length.{{Citation needed|date=March 2020}}  The tireless nature of the Mongol horse meant that it would have stayed fresh longer in battle, granting Genghis Khan's armies an endurance advantage.{{Citation needed|date=March 2020}}\n\nA warrior relied on his herd to provide him with staple foods of milk and meat; hide for bowstrings, shoes, and armor; dried dung to be used as fuel for his fire; hair for rope, battle standards, musical instruments and helmet decorations; milk also used for shamanistic ceremonies to ensure victory; and for hunting and entertainment that often served as military training.  If he died in battle, a horse would sometimes be sacrificed with him to provide a mount for the afterlife.\n\nThe main drawback to Mongol horses was their lack of speed.  They would lose short-distance races under equal conditions with larger horses from other regions. However, since most other armies carried much heavier armor, the Mongols could still outrun most enemy horsemen in battle. In addition, Mongolian horses were extremely durable and sturdy, allowing the Mongols to move over large distances quickly, often surprising enemies that had expected them to arrive days or even weeks later.{{Citation needed|date=March 2020}}\n\nAll horses were equipped with [[stirrup]]s. This technical advantage made it easier for the Mongol archers to turn their upper body, and shoot in all directions, including backwards. Mongol warriors would time the loosing of an arrow to the moment when a galloping horse would have all four feet off the ground, thus ensuring a steady, well-aimed shot.{{Citation needed|date=April 2020}}\n\nEach soldier had two to four horses\u2014so when a horse tired they could change to one of the others. This made them one of the fastest armies in the world, but also made the Mongol army vulnerable to shortages of fodder. Campaigning in arid regions such as Central Asia or forested regions of Southern China were thus difficult and even in ideal steppe terrain, a Mongol force had to keep moving to ensure sufficient grazing for its massive horse herd.\n\n== Logistics ==\n[[File:Mongol hunter with tame cheetah.jpg|thumb|180px|A [[Mongol]] warrior with a [[cheetah]]]]\n\n=== Supply ===\nMongol armies traveled light, and were able to live largely off the land. Their equipment included fish hooks and other tools meant to make each warrior independent of any fixed supply source. The most common travel food of the Mongols was dried and ground meat ''borts'', which remains common in [[Mongolian cuisine]] today. [[Borts]] is light and easy to transport, and can be cooked with water similarly to a modern \"instant soup\".\n\nTo ensure they would always have fresh horses, each trooper usually had 3 or 4 mounts.<ref name=\"All the Khan's Horses\"/> The horse is viewed much like a cow in Mongolia, and is milked and slaughtered for meat as such.  Since most of the Mongols' mounts were mares, they were able to live off their horses' milk or milk products as they moved through enemy territory.  In dire straits, the Mongol warrior could drink some of the blood from his string of remounts. They could survive a whole month on only drinking mare's milk combined with mare's blood.{{citation needed|date=August 2015}}\n\nHeavier equipment was brought up by well organized supply trains. Wagons and carts carried, amongst other things, large stockpiles of arrows. The main logistical factor limiting their advance was finding enough food and water for their animals.  This would lead to serious difficulties during some of the Mongol campaigns, such as [[Mongol invasions of the Levant|their conflicts with the Mamluks]], the arid terrain of [[Syria]] and [[the Levant]] making it difficult for large Mongol armies to penetrate the region, especially given the [[Mamluk]]'s [[scorched earth]] policy of burning grazing lands throughout the region.  It also limited the Mongol ability to exploit their success following the [[Battle of Mohi]], as even the [[Great Hungarian Plain]] was not large enough to provide grazing for all the flocks and herds following Subutai's army permanently.{{citation needed|date=August 2015}}\n\n=== Communications ===\nThe Mongols established a system of postal-relay horse stations called ''[[Yam (route)|\u00d6rt\u00f6\u00f6]]'', similar to the [[Royal Road|system employed in ancient Persia]] for fast transfer of written messages. The Mongol mail system was the first such empire-wide service since the Roman Empire. Additionally, Mongol battlefield communication utilized signal flags and horns and to a lesser extent, signal arrows to communicate movement orders during combat.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Great Armies of Antiquity|last=Gabriel|first=Richard A.|publisher=Praeger Publishers|year=2004|isbn=0275978095|location=|pages=343}}</ref>\n\n==Uniform==\n[[File:DiezAlbumsMountedArchers.jpg|thumb|220px|left|A [[Mongol]] melee in the 13th century.]]\nThe basic uniform of the Mongol fighting man consisted of a heavy coat fastened at the waist by a leather belt. From the belt would hang his sword, dagger, and possibly an axe. This long robe-like coat would double over, left breast over right, and be secured with a button a few inches below the right armpit. The coat was lined with fur. Underneath the coat, a shirt-like undergarment with long, wide sleeves was commonly worn. [[Silk]] and [[metal]]lic thread were increasingly used. The Mongols wore protective heavy silk undershirts. Even if an arrow pierced their mail or leather outer garment, the silk from the undershirt would stretch to wrap itself around the arrow as it entered the body, reducing damage caused by the arrow shaft, and making removal of the arrow easier.\n\nThe boots were made from felt and leather and, though heavy, would be comfortable and wide enough to accommodate the trousers tucked in before being laced tightly. They were heelless, though the soles were thick and lined with fur. Worn with felt socks, the feet were unlikely to get cold.\n\nLamellar armor was worn over the thick coat. The armor was composed of small scales of iron, chain mail, or hard leather sewn together with leather tongs and could weigh {{convert|10|kg}} if made of leather alone and more if the cuirass was made of metal scales. The leather was first softened by boiling and then coated in a crude lacquer made from pitch, which rendered it waterproof.<ref>George Lane - Ibid, p.99</ref> Sometimes the soldier's heavy coat was simply reinforced with metal plates.\n\nHelmets were cone shaped and composed of iron or steel plates of different sizes and included iron-plated neck guards. The Mongol cap was conical in shape and made of quilted material with a large turned-up brim, reversible in winter, and earmuffs. Whether a soldier's helmet was leather or metal depended on his rank and wealth.<ref name=\"George Lane 2004. p.31\"/>\n\n==Weapons==\n[[File:Mongol soldiers by Rashid al-Din 1305.JPG|thumb|Mongol soldiers using bow, in ''[[Jami al-Tawarikh]]'' by Rashid al-Din, 1305\u20131306.]]\n{{See also|Scimitar|Spear|Battle axe}}\n\nMounted archers were a major part of the armies of the [[Mongol Empire]], for instance at the 13th-century [[Battle of Legnica|Battle of Liegnitz]], where an army including 20,000 horse archers defeated a force of 30,000 troops led by [[Henry II the Pious|Henry II]], duke of Silesia, via demoralization and continued harassment.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Hildinger|first1=Erik|title=Mongol Invasions: Battle of Liegnitz|journal=Military History|date=June 1997|url=http://www.historynet.com/mongol-invasions-battle-of-liegnitz.htm|accessdate=28 June 2014}}</ref>\n\n===Mongol bow===\n{{Main|Mongol bow}}\nThe primary weapon of the Mongol forces was their [[composite bow]]s made from [[laminate]]d [[Horn (anatomy)#Human uses of horns|horn]], wood, and [[Sinew#Uses of sinew|sinew]]. The layer of horn is on the inner face as it resists compression, while the layer of sinew is on the outer face as it resists tension. Such bows, with minor variations, had been the main weapon of steppe herdsmen and steppe warriors for over two millennia; Mongols (and many of their subject peoples) were extremely skilled with them. Some were said to be able to hit a bird on the wing. Composite construction allows a powerful and relatively efficient bow to be made small enough that it can be used easily from horseback.<ref name=\"George Lane 2004. p.31\"/>\n\nQuivers containing sixty [[arrow]]s were strapped to the backs of their cavalrymen and to their horses. Mongol archers typically carried 2 to 3 bows (one heavier and intended for dismounted use, the other lighter and used from horseback) that were accompanied by multiple quivers and files for sharpening their arrowheads. These arrowheads were hardened by plunging them in brine after first heating them red hot.<ref>\"Daily Life in the Mongol Empire\", George Lane, (page 102)</ref>\n\nThe Mongols could shoot an arrow over {{convert|200 |m}}. Targeted shots were possible at a range of {{convert|150|or|175|m}}, which determined the optimal tactical approach distance for light [[cavalry]] units. [[Trajectory of a projectile|Ballistic]] shots could hit enemy units (without targeting individual soldiers) at distances of up to {{convert|400|m}}, useful for surprising and scaring troops and horses before beginning the actual attack. Shooting from the back of a moving horse may be more accurate if the arrow is loosed in the phase of the [[Horse gait#Gallop|gallop]] when all four of the horse's feet are off the ground.<ref>Saunders, John Joseph.

The Manchus forbade archery by their Mongol subjects, and the Mongolian bowmaking tradition was lost during the [[Qing Dynasty]]. The present bowmaking tradition emerged after independence in 1921 and is based on [[Manchu people#Riding and archery|Manchu]] types of bow, somewhat different to the bows known to have been used by the Mongol empire.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.atarn.org/mongolian/mn_nat_arch/mn_nat_arch.htm |title=Mongolian National Archery |author=Munkhtsetseg |date=18 July 2000 |work=INSTINCTIVE ARCHER MAGAZINE |publisher= |accessdate=16 June 2011}}</ref> [[Mounted archery]] had fallen into disuse and has been revived only in the 21st century.\n\n===Sword===\nMongol swords were a slightly curved [[scimitar]], which they used for slashing attacks but could also use to cut and thrust, due to its shape and construction. This made it easier to use from horseback. Warriors could use the sword with a one-handed or two-handed grip. Its blade was usually around {{convert|2.5|ft}} in length, with an overall length of approximately {{convert|1|m}}.\n\n===Gunpowder===\n====Jin dynasty====\nThe first concerted Mongol invasion of Jin occurred in 1211 and total conquest was not accomplished until 1234. In 1232 the Mongols besieged the Jin capital of Kaifeng and deployed gunpowder weapons along with other more conventional siege techniques such as building stockades, watchtowers, trenches, guardhouses, and forcing Chinese captives to haul supplies and fill moats.{{sfn|Andrade|2016|p=45}} Jin scholar Liu Qi (\u5289\u7948) recounts in his memoir, \"the attack against the city walls grew increasingly intense, and bombs rained down as [the enemy] advanced.\"{{sfn|Andrade|2016|p=45}} The Jin defenders also deployed gunpowder bombs as well as fire arrows (''huo jian'' \u706b\u7bad) launched using a type of early solid-propellant rocket.{{sfn|Liang|2006}} Of the bombs, Liu Qi writes, \"From within the walls the defenders responded with a gunpowder bomb called the heaven-shaking-thunder bomb (\u9707\u5929\u96f7). Whenever the [Mongol] troops encountered one, several men at a time would be turned into ashes.\"{{sfn|Andrade|2016|p=45}} A more fact based and clear description of the bomb exists in the ''[[History of Jin]]'': \"The heaven-shaking-thunder bomb is an iron vessel filled with gunpowder. When lighted with fire and shot off, it goes off like a crash of thunder that can be heard for a hundred li [thirty miles], burning an expanse of land more than half a mu [\u6240\u7207\u570d\u534a\u755d\u4e4b\u4e0a, a mu is a sixth of an acre], and the fire can even penetrate iron armor.\"{{sfn|Andrade|2016|p=45}} A Ming official named He Mengchuan would encounter an old cache of these bombs three centuries later in the Xi'an area: \"When I went on official business to Shaanxi Province, I saw on top of Xi'an's city walls an old stockpile of iron bombs. They were called 'heaven-shaking-thunder' bombs, and they were like an enclosed rice bowl with a hole at the top, just big enough to put your finger in. The troops said they hadn't been used for a very long time.\"{{sfn|Andrade|2016|p=45}} Furthermore, he wrote, \"When the powder goes off, the bomb rips open, and the iron pieces fly in all directions. That is how it is able to kill people and horses from far away.\"{{sfn|Andrade|2016|p=46}}\n\nHeaven-shaking-thunder bombs, also known as thunder crash bombs, were utilized prior to the siege in 1231 when a Jin general made use of them in destroying a Mongol warship, but during the siege the Mongols responded by protecting themselves with elaborate screens of thick cowhide. This was effective enough for workers to get right up to the walls to undermine their foundations and excavate protective niches. Jin defenders countered by tying iron cords and attaching them to heaven-shaking-thunder bombs, which were lowered down the walls until they reached the place where the miners worked. The protective leather screens were unable to withstand the explosion, and were penetrated, killing the excavators.{{sfn|Andrade|2016|p=46}} Another weapon the Jin employed was an improved version of the fire lance called the flying fire lance. The ''History of Jin'' provides a detailed description: \"To make the lance, use chi-huang paper, sixteen layers of it for the tube, and make it a bit longer than two feet. Stuff it with willow charcoal, iron fragments, magnet ends, sulfur, white arsenic [probably an error that should mean saltpeter], and other ingredients, and put a fuse to the end. Each troop has hanging on him a little iron pot to keep fire [probably hot coals], and when it's time to do battle, the flames shoot out the front of the lance more than ten feet, and when the gunpowder is depleted, the tube isn't destroyed.\"{{sfn|Andrade|2016|p=46}} While Mongol soldiers typically held a view of disdain toward most Jin weapons, apparently they greatly feared the flying fire lance and heaven-shaking-thunder bomb.{{sfn|Andrade|2016|p=45}} Kaifeng managed to hold out for a year before the Jin emperor fled and the city capitulated. In some cases Jin troops still fought with some success, scoring isolated victories such as when a Jin commander led 450 fire lancers against a Mongol encampment, which was \"completely routed, and three thousand five hundred were drowned.\"{{sfn|Andrade|2016|p=46}} Even after the Jin emperor committed suicide in 1234, one loyalist gathered all the metal he could find in the city he was defending, even gold and silver, and made explosives to lob against the Mongols, but the momentum of the Mongol Empire could not be stopped.{{sfn|Andrade|2016|p46-47}} By 1234, both the Western Xia and Jin dynasty had been conquered.{{sfn|Andrade|2016|p=47}}\n\n====Song dynasty====\nThe Mongol war machine moved south and in 1237 attacked the Song city of Anfeng (modern [[Shouxian]], [[Anhui Province]]) \"using gunpowder bombs [huo pao] to burn the [defensive] towers.\"{{sfn|Andrade|2016|p=47}} These bombs were apparently quite large. \"Several hundred men hurled one bomb, and if it hit the tower it would immediately smash it to pieces.\"{{sfn|Andrade|2016|p=47}} The Song defenders under commander Du Gao (\u675c\u6772) rebuilt the towers and retaliated with their own bombs, which they called the \"Elipao,\" after a famous local pear, probably in reference to the shape of the weapon.{{sfn|Andrade|2016|p=47}} Perhaps as another point of military interest, the account of this battle also mentions that the Anfeng defenders were equipped with a type of small arrow to shoot through eye slits of Mongol armor, as normal arrows were too thick to penetrate.{{sfn|Andrade|2016|p=47}}\n\nBy the mid 13th century, gunpowder weapons had become central to the Song war effort. In 1257 the Song official Li Zengbo was dispatched to inspect frontier city arsenals. Li considered an ideal city arsenal to include several hundred thousand iron bombshells, and also its own production facility to produce at least a couple thousand a month. The results of his tour of the border were severely disappointing and in one arsenal he found \"no more than 85 iron bomb-shells, large and small, 95 fire-arrows, and 105 fire-lances. This is not sufficient for a mere hundred men, let alone a thousand, to use against an attack by the ... barbarians. The government supposedly wants to make preparations for the defense of its fortified cities, and to furnish them with military supplies against the enemy (yet this is all they give us). What chilling indifference!\"{{sfn|Andrade|2016|p=47-48}} Fortunately for the Song, [[M\u00f6ngke Khan]] died in 1259 and the war would not continue until 1269 under the leadership of [[Kublai Khan]], but when it did the Mongols came in full force.\n\nBlocking the Mongols' passage south of the Yangtze were the twin fortress cities of Xiangyang and Fancheng. What resulted was one of the longest sieges the world had ever known, lasting from 1268 to 1273. For the first three years the Song defenders had been able to receive supplies and reinforcements by water, but in 1271 the Mongols set up a full blockade with a formidable navy of their own, isolating the two cities. This didn't prevent the Song from running the supply route anyway, and two men with the surname Zhang did exactly that. The Two Zhangs commanded a hundred paddle wheel boats, travelling by night under the light of lantern fire, but were discovered early on by a Mongol commander. When the Song fleet arrived near the cities, they found the Mongol fleet to have spread themselves out along the entire width of the Yangtze with \"vessels spread out, filling the entire surface of the river, and there was no gap for them to enter.\"{{sfn|Andrade|2016|p=48}} Another defensive measure the Mongols had taken was the construction of a chain, which stretched across the water.{{sfn|Andrade|2016|p=48}} The two fleets engaged in combat and the Song opened fire with fire-lances, fire-bombs, and crossbows. A large number of men died trying to cut through chains, pull up stakes, and hurl bombs, while Song marines fought hand to hand using large axes, and according to the Mongol record, \"on their ships they were up to the ankles in blood.\"{{sfn|Andrade|2016|p=49}} With the rise of dawn, the Song vessels made it to the city walls and the citizens \"leapt up a hundred times in joy.\"{{sfn|Andrade|2016|p=49}} In 1273 the Mongols enlisted the expertise of two Muslim engineers, one from Persia and one from Syria, who helped in the construction of counterweight trebuchets. These new siege weapons had the capability of throwing larger missiles further than the previous traction trebuchets. One account records, \"when the machinery went off the noise shook heaven and earth; every thing that [the missile] hit was broken and destroyed.\"{{sfn|Andrade|2016|p=49}} The fortress city of Xiangyang fell in 1273.{{sfn|Andrade|2016|p=50}}\n\nThe next major battle to feature gunpowder weapons was during a campaign led by the Mongol general Bayan, who commanded an army of around two hundred thousand, consisting of mostly Chinese soldiers. It was probably the largest army the Mongols had ever utilized. Such an army was still unable to successfully storm Song city walls, as seen in the 1274 Siege of Shayang. Thus Bayan waited for the wind to change to a northerly course before ordering his artillerists to begin bombarding the city with molten metal bombs, which caused such a fire that \"the buildings were burned up and the smoke and flames rose up to heaven.\"{{sfn|Andrade|2016|p=50}} Shayang was captured and its inhabitants massacred.{{sfn|Andrade|2016|p=50}}\n\nGunpowder bombs were used again in the 1275 Siege of Changzhou in the latter stages of the Mongol-Song Wars. Upon arriving at the city, Bayan gave the inhabitants an ultimatum: \"if you ... resist us ... we shall drain your carcasses of blood and use them for pillows.\"{{sfn|Andrade|2016|p=50}} This didn't work and the city resisted anyway, so the Mongol army bombarded them with fire bombs before storming the walls, after which followed an immense slaughter claiming the lives of a quarter million.{{sfn|Andrade|2016|p=50}} The war lasted for only another four years during which some remnants of the Song held up last desperate defenses. In 1277, 250 defenders under Lou Qianxia conducted a suicide bombing and set off a huge iron bomb when it became clear defeat was imminent. Of this, the ''History of Song'' writes, \"the noise was like a tremendous thunderclap, shaking the walls and ground, and the smoke filled up the heavens outside. Many of the troops [outside] were startled to death. When the fire was extinguished they went in to see. There were just ashes, not a trace left.\"{{sfn|Andrade|2016|p=50-51}}{{sfn|Partington|1960|p=250, 244, 149}} So came an end to the Mongol-Song Wars, which saw the deployment of all the gunpowder weapons available to both sides at the time, which for the most part meant gunpowder arrows, bombs, and lances, but in retrospect, another development would overshadow them all, the birth of the gun.{{sfn|Andrade|2016|p=51}}\n\nIn 1280, a large store of gunpowder at [[Weiyang District, Yangzhou|Weiyang]] in [[Yangzhou]] accidentally caught fire, producing such a massive explosion that a team of inspectors at the site a week later deduced that some 100 guards had been killed instantly, with wooden beams and pillars blown sky high and landing at a distance of over 10 [[li (unit)|li]] (~2&nbsp;mi. or ~3&nbsp;km) away from the explosion, creating a crater more than ten feet deep.<ref name=\"needham volume 5 part 7 209 210\" >[[#Needham, V 7|Needham, V 7]], pp.&nbsp;209\u2013210.</ref> One resident described the noise of the explosion as if it \"was like a volcano erupting, a tsunami crashing. The entire population was terrified.\"{{sfn|Andrade|2016|p=15}} According to surviving reports, the incident was caused by inexperienced gunpowder makers hired to replace the previous ones, and had been careless while grinding sulfur. A spark caused by the grinding process came into contact with some fire lances which immediately started spewing flames and jetting around \"like frightened snakes.\"{{sfn|Andrade|2016|p=15}} The gunpowder makers did nothing as they found the sight highly amusing, that is until one fire lance burst into a cache of bombs, causing the entire complex to explode. The validity of this report is somewhat questionable, assuming everyone within the immediate vicinity was killed.{{sfn|Andrade|2016|p=15}}\n\n{{quotation|The disaster of the trebuchet bomb arsenal at Weiyang was still more terrible. Formerly the artisan positions were all held by southerners (i.e. the Chinese). But they engaged in peculation, so they had to be dismissed, and all their jobs were given to northerners (probably Mongols, or Chinese who had served them). Unfortunately, these men understood nothing of the handling of chemical substances. Suddenly, one day, while sulphur was being ground fine, it burst into flame, then the (stored) fire-lances caught fire, and flashed hither and thither like frightened snakes. (At first) the workers thought it was funny, laughing and joking, but after a short time the fire got into the bomb store, and then there was a noise like a volcanic eruption and the howling of a storm at sea. The whole city was terrified, thinking that an army was approaching, and panic soon spread among the people, who could not tell whether it was near or far away. Even at a distance of a hundred ''li'' tiles shook and houses trembled. People gave alarms of fire but the troops were held strictly to discipline. The disturbance lasted a whole day and night.\nAfter order had been restored an inspection was made, and it was found that a hundred men of the guards had been blown to bits, beams and pillars had been deft asunder or carried away by the force of the explosion to a distance over ten ''li''. The smooth ground was scooped into craters and trenches more than ten feet deep. Above two hundred families living in the neighbourhood were victims of this unexpected disaster.

The sculptures were completed roughly 250&nbsp;km northwest of [[Chongqing]] by 1128, after the fall of Kaifeng to the Jin dynasty. If the dating is correct this would push back the appearance of the cannon in China by a hundred years more than previously thought.{{sfn|Lu|1988}} The bulbous nature of the cannon is congruous with the earliest hand cannons discovered in China and Europe.\n\nArchaeological samples of the gun, specifically the [[hand cannon]] ([[huochong]]), have been dated starting from the 13th century. The oldest extant gun whose dating is unequivocal is the [[Xanadu Gun]], so called because it was discovered in the ruins of [[Shangdu|Xanadu]], the Mongol summer palace in Inner Mongolia. The Xanadu Gun is 34.7&nbsp;cm in length and weighs 6.2&nbsp;kg. Its dating is based on archaeological context and a straightforward inscription whose era name and year corresponds with the Gregorian Calendar at 1298. Not only does the inscription contain the era name and date, it also includes a serial number and manufacturing information which suggests that gun production had already become systematized, or at least become a somewhat standardized affair by the time of its fabrication. The design of the gun includes axial holes in its rear which some speculate could have been used in a mounting mechanism. Like most early guns with the possible exception of the Western Xia gun, it is small, weighing just over six kilograms and thirty-five centimeters in length.{{sfn|Andrade|2016|p=52-53}} Although the Xanadu Gun is the most precisely dated gun from the 13th century, other extant samples with approximate dating likely predate it.\n\nOne candidate is the [[Heilongjiang hand cannon]], discovered in 1970, and named after the province of its discovery, Heilongjiang, in northeastern China.<ref>Chase, Kenneth Warren (2003).

The [[History of Yuan]] states that a Jurchen commander known as Li Ting led troops armed with hand cannons into battle against Nayan.{{sfn|Needham|1986|p=293-4}}\n\nEven older, the Ningxia gun was found in Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region by collector Meng Jianmin (\u5b5f\u5efa\u6c11). This Yuan dynasty firearm is 34.6&nbsp;cm long, the muzzle 2.6&nbsp;cm in diameter, and weighs 1.55 kilograms.

While the era name and date corresponds with the Gregorian Calendar at 1271 CE, putting it earlier than both the Heilongjiang Hand Gun as well as the Xanadu Gun, but one of the characters used in the era name is irregular, causing some doubt among scholars on the exact date of production.{{sfn|Andrade|2016|p=329}}\n\nAnother specimen, the [[Wuwei Bronze Cannon]], was discovered in 1980 and may possibly be the oldest as well as largest cannon of the 13th century: a 100 centimeter 108 kilogram bronze cannon discovered in a cellar in [[Wuwei, Gansu|Wuwei]], [[Gansu Province]] containing no inscription, but has been dated by historians to the late Western Xia period between 1214 and 1227. The gun contained an iron ball about nine centimeters in diameter, which is smaller than the muzzle diameter at twelve centimeters, and 0.1 kilograms of gunpowder in it when discovered, meaning that the projectile might have been another co-viative.{{sfn|Andrade|2016|p=53-54}} Ben Sinvany and Dang Shoushan believe that the ball used to be much larger prior to its highly corroded state at the time of discovery.{{sfn|Andrade|2016|p=330}} While large in size, the weapon is noticeably more primitive than later Yuan dynasty guns, and is unevenly cast.

For instance, [[siege engine|siege machine]]s were an important part of Genghis Khan's warfare, especially in attacking fortified cities. The siege engines were not disassembled and carried by horses to be rebuilt at the site of the battle, as was the usual practice with European armies. Instead the Mongol horde would travel with skilled engineers who would build siege engines from scratch from materials on site.\n\nThe engineers building the machines were recruited among captives, mostly from China and Persia, led by a [[Han Chinese|Han]] general [[Guo Kan]]. When Mongols slaughtered the whole population from settlements that resisted or did not surrender, they often spared the engineers and other units, swiftly assimilating them into the Mongol armies.\n\nEngineers in Mongol service displayed a considerable degree of ingenuity and planning; during a siege of a fortified Chinese city, the defenders had taken care to remove all large rocks from the region to deny the Mongols an ammunition supply for their [[trebuchets]], but the Mongol engineers resorted to cutting up logs which they soaked in water to make suitably heavy spheres. During the siege of the [[Order of Assassins|Assassins]]' fortress of [[Alamut Castle|Alamut]] the Mongols gathered large rocks from far and wide, piling them up in depots a day's journey from one another all the way to their siege lines so that a huge supply was available for the breaching batteries operating against the mighty citadel.  The Mongols also scouted the hills around the city to find suitable higher ground on which to mount [[ballista]]s manned by northern Chinese engineers, allowing these to snipe into the interior of the fortress. The Mongols made effective use of the siege technologies developed by their subject peoples; Genghis Khan utilized the Chinese engineers and traction trebuchets he had gained from his victories over the [[Jurchens]] and [[Tanguts]] during his [[Mongol invasion of Khwarezmia and Eastern Iran|Khwarezmian campaign]], while Kublai Khan later called upon Muslim engineers from his [[Il-Khanid|Ilkhanate]] cousins to build counterweight trebuchets that finally concluded the six year [[Battle of Xiangyang|siege of Fancheng and Xiangyang]].\n\n==== Kharash ====\nA commonly used tactic was the use of what was called the \"kharash\". The Mongols would gather prisoners captured in previous battles, and would drive them forward in sieges and battles. These \"shields\" would often take the brunt of enemy arrows and crossbow bolts, thus somewhat protecting the Mongol warriors.<ref>\"Genghis Khan: A Biography\", Zofia Stone</ref> The kharash were also used as assault units to breach walls.\n\n== Strategy ==\n[[File:\u30e2\u30f3\u30b4\u30eb\u578b\u76ae\u93a7.jpg|thumb|100px|Helmet and armor of a [[Mongol]] [[Yuan Dynasty|Yuan]] warrior during the [[Mongol invasion of Japan]]]]\nThe Mongol battlefield tactics were a combination of masterful training with excellent communication and discipline in the chaos of combat. They trained for virtually every possibility, so when it occurred, they could react accordingly. The Mongols also protected their ranking officers well. Their training and discipline allowed them to fight without the need for constant supervision or rallying, which often placed commanders in dangerous positions.\n\nWhenever possible, Mongol commanders found the highest ground available, from which they could make tactical decisions based on the best view of the battlefield as events unfolded. Furthermore, being on high ground allowed their forces to observe commands conveyed by flags more easily than if the ground were level. In addition, keeping the high command on high ground made them easier to defend from sudden attacks and invasions.\n\n=== Intelligence and planning ===\nThe Mongols carefully scouted out and spied on their enemies in advance of any invasion. Prior to the invasion of Europe, Batu and Subutai sent spies for almost ten years into the heart of Europe, making maps of the old Roman roads, establishing trade routes, and determining the level of ability of each principality to resist invasion. They made well-educated guesses as to the willingness of each principality to aid the others, and their ability to resist alone or together. Also, when invading an area, the Mongols would do all that was necessary to completely conquer the town or cities. Some tactics involved diverting rivers from the city/town {{Citation needed|date=May 2010}}, closing supplies to the city and waiting for its inhabitants to surrender, gathering civilians from the nearby areas to fill the front line for the city/town attack before scaling the wall, and pillaging the surrounding area and killing some of the people, then letting some survivors flee to the main city to report their losses to the main populace to weaken resistance, simultaneously draining the resources of the city with the sudden influx of refugees.\n\n=== Psychological warfare and deception ===\n{{Main|Destruction under the Mongol Empire}}\n[[File:Vladimir mongols.jpg|thumb|220px|Drawing of Mongols outside [[Vladimir, Russia|Vladimir]] presumably demanding submission before its sacking.]]\nThe Mongols used [[psychological warfare]] extremely successfully in many of their battles, especially in terms of spreading terror and fear to towns and cities. They often offered an opportunity for the enemy to surrender and pay [[tribute]], instead of having their city ransacked and destroyed. They knew that sedentary populations were not free to flee danger as were nomad populations, and that the destruction of their cities was the worst loss a sedentary population could experience. When cities accepted the offer, they were spared, but were required to support the conquering Mongol army with manpower, supplies, and other services.\n\nIf the offer was refused, however, the Mongols would invade and destroy the city or town, but allow a few civilians to flee and spread terror by reporting their loss. These reports were an essential tool to incite fear in others. However, both sides often had a similar if differently motivated interest in overstating the enormity of the reported events: the Mongols' reputation would increase and the townspeople could use their reports of terror to raise an army. For that reason, specific data (e.g. casualty figures) given in contemporary sources needs to be evaluated carefully.{{fact|date=June 2019}}\n\nThe Mongols also used deception very well in their wars. For instance, when approaching a mobile army the units would be split into three or more army groups, each trying to outflank and surprise their opponents. This created many battlefield scenarios for the opponents where the Mongols would seem to appear out of nowhere and there were seemingly more of them than in actuality. Flanking and/or feigned retreat if the enemy could not be handled easily was one of the most practiced techniques. Other techniques used commonly by the Mongols were completely psychological and were used to entice/lure enemies into vulnerable positions by showing themselves from a hill or some other predetermined locations, then disappearing into the woods or behind hills while the Mongols' flank troops already strategically positioned would appear as if out of nowhere from the left, right and/or from their rear. During the initial states of battlefield contact, while camping in close proximity of their enemies at night, they would feign numerical superiority by ordering each soldier to light at least five fires, which would appear to the enemy scouts and spies that their force was almost five times larger than it actually was.{{fact|date=June 2019}}\n\nAnother way the Mongols used deception and terror was by tying tree branches or leaves behind their horses. They dragged the foliage behind them in a systematic fashion to create dust storms behind hills to appear to the enemy as a much larger attacking army, thereby forcing the enemy to surrender. Because each Mongol soldier had more than one horse, they would let prisoners and civilians ride their horses for a while before the conflict, also to exaggerate their manpower.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://home.arcor.de/mustangace/sca_class_mongols.htm |title=sca_class_mongols |publisher=Home.arcor.de |date= |accessdate=2014-03-07}}</ref>\n\n===Inclusion===\nAs they were conquering new people, the Mongols integrated into their armies the conquered people's men if they had surrendered - willingly or otherwise. Therefore, as they expanded into other areas and conquered other people, their troop numbers increased. Exemplifying this is the [[Siege of Baghdad (1258)|Battle of Baghdad]], during which many diverse people fought under Mongol lordship. Despite this integration, the Mongols were never able to gain long-term loyalty from the settled peoples that they conquered.<ref>Lane, G. (2006). Propaganda. In Daily Life in the Mongol Empire. Westport, Connecticut: Greenwood Publishing Group.</ref>\n\n==Ground tactics==\nThe [[Tumen (unit)|tumens]] would typically advance on a broad front, five lines deep. The first three lines would be composed of horse archers, the last two of lancers. Once an enemy force was located, the Mongols would try to avoid risky or reckless frontal assaults. Instead they would use diversionary attacks to fix the enemy in place, while their main forces sought to outflank or surround the foe. First the horse archers would lay down a barrage of arrow fire. Additional arrows were carried by camels who followed close by, ensuring a plentiful supply of ammunition.{{fact|date=June 2019}}\n\n===Flanking===\n[[File:Battle of Mohi.svg|thumb|250px|Mongols in [[Battle of Mohi]] split into more than three separate formations and one formation under [[Subutai]] flanking the opponent from the right]]\n\nIn all battlefield situations, the troops would be divided into separate formations of 10, 100, 1,000 or 10,000 depending on the requirements. If the number of troops split from the main force was significant, for instance 10,000 or more, these would be handed over to a significant or second-in-command leader, while the main leader concentrated on the front line. The leader of the Mongols would generally issue the tactics used to attack the enemy. For instance the leader might order, upon seeing a city or town, \"500 to the left and 500 to the right\" of the city; those instructions would then be relayed to the relevant 5 units of 100 soldiers, and these would attempt to flank or encircle the town to the left and right.<ref name=\"Mongoltactic\">[https://www.deviantart.com/jwiesner/journal/The-15-Military-Tactics-of-Chinggis-Khan-537500553 The 15 Military Tactics of Chinggis Khan], 5 May 2019</ref>\n\n===Encirclement and opening===\nThe main point of these maneuvers was to encircle the city to cut off escape and overwhelm from both sides. If the situation deteriorated on one of the fronts or flanks, the leader from the hill directed one part of the army to support the other. If it appeared that there was going to be significant loss, the Mongols would retreat to save their troops and would engage the next day, or the next month, after having studied the enemies' tactics and defenses in the first battle, or again send a demand to surrender after inflicting some form of damage. There was no fixture on when or where units should be deployed: it was dependent on battle circumstances, and the flanks and groups had full authority on what to do in the course of battle - such as supporting other flanks or performing an individual [[feigned retreat]] as conditions seemed appropriate, in small groups of 100 to 1000 - so long as the battle unfolded according to the general directive and the opponents were defeated.<ref name=\"Mongoltactic\" />\n\n===Feigned retreat===\nThe Mongols very commonly practiced the [[feigned retreat]], perhaps the most difficult battlefield tactic to execute.

Prosperity was stimulated by heavy government spending and the creation of an entirely new national banking system. The Union states invested a great deal of money and effort in organizing psychological and social support for soldiers' wives, widows, and orphans, and for the soldiers themselves. Most soldiers were volunteers, although after 1862 many volunteered in order to escape the draft and to take advantage of generous cash bounties on offer from states and localities. Draft resistance was notable in some larger cities, especially [[New York City draft riots|New York City]] with its massive anti-draft riots of July 1863 and in some remote districts such as the coal mining areas of Pennsylvania.\n\n==Etymology==\n\n[[File: Charleston Mercury Secession Broadside, 1860.jpg|thumb|[[Charleston Mercury]] Secession Broadside, 1860\u2014\"The Union\" had been a way to refer to the American Republic.]]\n\nIn the context of the American Civil War, the Union is sometimes referred to as \"the North\", both then and now, as opposed to the Confederacy, which was \"the South\". The Union never recognized the legitimacy of the Confederacy's secession and maintained at all times that it remained entirely a part of the United States of America. In foreign affairs the Union was the only side recognized by all other nations, none of which officially recognized the Confederate government. The term \"Union\" occurs in the first governing document of the United States, the [[Articles of Confederation|'' Articles of Confederation and Perpetual Union.'']] The subsequent [[United States Constitution|Constitution]] of 1787 was issued and ratified in the name not of the states, but of \"We the People of the United States, in order to form a more perfect Union{{nbsp}}...\" ''Union'', for the United States of America, is then repeated in such clauses as the [[Admission to the Union]] clause in Article IV, Section 3.\n\nEven before the war started, the phrase \"preserve the Union\" was commonplace, and a \"union of states\" had been used to refer to the entire United States of America. Using the term \"Union\" to apply to the non-secessionist tee hee side carried a connotation of legitimacy as the continuation of the pre-existing political entity.<ref>{{cite news|author=Stampp, Kenneth M. |title=The Concept of a Perpetual Union|work=The Imperiled Union: Essays on the Background of the Civil War|date=1980|page=30}}</ref>\n\nConfederates generally saw the Union as being opposed to slavery, occasionally referring to them as abolitionists, as in reference to the U.S. Navy as the \"Abolition fleet\" and the U.S. Army as the \"Abolition forces\".<ref>{{Cite book|url=http://civilwartalk.com/threads/did-the-southern-soldier-fight-and-die-to-preserve-slavery.117485/page-22#post-1198090|title=The war of the rebellion: a compilation of the official records of the Union and Confederate armies|series=1|volume=14|pages=185\u20131,015|accessdate=March 19, 2016}}</ref>\n\n==Size and strength==\n\n[[File:Advantages.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.25|The Union had large advantages in men and resources at the start of the war, and the ratio grew steadily in favor of the Union.

Meanwhile, the Union turned its growing potential advantage into a much stronger military force. However, much of the Union strength had to be used to garrison conquered areas, and to protect railroads and other vital points. The Union's great advantages in population and industry would prove to be vital long-term factors in its victory over the Confederacy, but it took the Union a long while to fully mobilize these resources.\n{{Union states in the American Civil War}}\n\n==Public opinion==\n\nThe attack on [[Fort Sumter]] rallied the North to the defense of American nationalism.

Voters became afraid of power being centralized in Washington, extravagant spending, and war profiteering. Democratic candidates emphasized these fears. The candidates added that rapid modernization was putting too much political power in the hands of Eastern financiers and industrialists. They warned that the abolition of slavery would bring a flood of freed blacks into the labor market of the North.\n\nRepublicans responded with claims of defeatism. They indicted Copperheads for criminal conspiracies to free Confederate [[Prisoner of war|prisoners of war]], and played on the spirit of nationalism and the growing hatred of the slave owners, as the guilty party in the war.<ref>{{cite book|author=Smith, Michael Thomas |title=The Enemy Within: Fears of Corruption in the Civil War North|date=2011}}</ref>\n\n==President Lincoln==\n\n{{main|Presidency of Abraham Lincoln}}\n\nHistorians have [[Historical rankings of Presidents of the United States|overwhelmingly praised]] the \"political genius\" of Abraham Lincoln's performance as President.<ref>{{cite book|author=Goodwin, Doris Kearns |title=Team of Rivals: The Political Genius of Abraham Lincoln|url=https://archive.org/details/teamofrivalspoli00good |url-access=registration |date=2005}}</ref> His first priority was military victory. This required that he master entirely new skills as a strategist and diplomat. He oversaw supplies, finances, manpower, the selection of generals, and the course of overall strategy. Working closely with state and local politicians, he rallied public opinion and (at [[Gettysburg Address|Gettysburg]]) articulated a national mission that has defined America ever since. Lincoln's charm and willingness to cooperate with political and personal enemies made Washington work much more smoothly than [[Richmond, VA|Richmond]], the Confederate capital, and his wit smoothed many rough edges. Lincoln's cabinet proved much stronger and more efficient than Davis's, as Lincoln channeled personal rivalries into a competition for excellence rather than mutual destruction. With [[William H. Seward|William Seward]] at [[State Department|State]], [[Salmon P. Chase]] at the [[United States Department of the Treasury|Treasury]], and (from 1862) [[Edwin Stanton]] at the [[United States Department of War|War Department]], Lincoln had a powerful [[Cabinet (government)|cabinet]] of determined men. Except for monitoring major appointments and decisions, Lincoln gave them free rein to end the Confederate rebellion.<ref>{{cite book|author=Paludsn, Phillip Shaw |title=The Presidency of Abraham Lincoln|date=1994|pages=21\u201348}}</ref>\n\n==Congress==\n\nThe Republican Congress passed many major laws that reshaped the nation's economy, financial system, tax system, land system, and higher education system. These included: the [[Morrill tariff]], the [[Homestead Act]], the [[Pacific Railroad Act]], and the [[National Banking Act]].<ref>Leonard P. Curry, ''Blueprint for Modern America: Nonmilitary Legislation of the First Civil War Congress'' (1968)</ref> Lincoln paid relatively little attention to this legislation as he focused on war issues but he worked smoothly with powerful Congressional leaders such as [[Thaddeus Stevens]] (on taxation and spending), [[Charles Sumner]] (on foreign affairs), [[Lyman Trumbull]] (on legal issues), [[Justin Smith Morrill]] (on land grants and tariffs) and [[William Pitt Fessenden]] (on finances).<ref>Robert Cook, \"Stiffening Abe: William Pitt Fessenden and the Role of the Broker Politician in the Civil War Congress,\" ''American Nineteenth Century History'', June 2007, Vol.{{nbsp}}8 Issue 2, pp 145\u2013167</ref>\n\nMilitary and reconstruction issues were another matter. Lincoln, as the leader of the moderate and conservative factions of the Republican Party, often crossed swords with the [[Radical Republicans]], led by Stevens and Sumner. Author, Bruce Tap, shows that Congress challenged Lincoln's role as commander-in-chief through the [[Joint Committee on the Conduct of the War]]. It was a joint committee of both houses that was dominated by the Radical Republicans, who took a hard line against the Confederacy. During the 37th and 38th Congresses, the committee investigated every aspect of Union military operations, with special attention to finding commanders culpable for military defeats. It assumed an inevitable Union victory. Failure was perceived to indicate evil motivations or personal failures. The committee distrusted graduates of the US Military Academy at West Point, since many of the academy's alumni were leaders of the enemy army. Members of the committee much preferred political generals with a satisfactory political record. Some of the committee suggested that West-Pointers who engaged in strategic maneuver were cowardly or even disloyal. It ended up endorsing incompetent but politically correct generals.<ref>Bruce Tap, \"Inevitability, masculinity, and the American military tradition: the committee on the conduct of the war investigates the American Civil War,\" ''American Nineteenth Century History'', (2004) 5#2 pp 19\u201346</ref>\n\n===Opposition===\n\n[[File:~abe2.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Anti-Lincoln Copperhead pamphlet from 1864]]\n\nThe opposition came from [[Copperhead (politics)|Copperhead Democrats]], who were strongest in the Midwest and wanted to allow Confederate secession. In the East, opposition to the war was strongest among Irish Catholics, but also included business interests connected to the South typified by [[August Belmont]]. The [[History of the Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]] was deeply split. In 1861 most Democrats supported the war. However, the party increasingly split down the middle between the moderates who supported the war effort, and the peace element, including Copperheads, who did not. It scored major gains in the 1862 elections, and elected the moderate [[Horatio Seymour]] as governor of New York. [[United States House of Representatives elections, 1862|They gained 28 seats in the House of Representatives]] but Republicans retained control of both the House and the Senate.\n[[File:Emancipation proclamation.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.15|Lincoln met with his [[Cabinet of the United States|Cabinet]] for the first reading of the [[Emancipation Proclamation]] draft on July 22, 1862.]]\n\nThe 1862 election for the Indiana legislature was especially hard-fought.

In terms of Congress the opposition against the war was nearly powerless\u2014as was the case in most states.

For 30 years after the war the Democrats carried the burden of having opposed the martyred Lincoln, who was viewed by many as the salvation of the Union and the destroyer of slavery.<ref>[[Joel Silbey]], ''A respectable minority: the Democratic Party in the Civil War era, 1860\u20131868'' (1977) [https://www.questia.com/read/105266888 online edition]</ref>\n\n===Copperheads===\n\n{{main|Copperheads (politics)}}\n\nThe Copperheads were a large faction of northern Democrats who opposed the war, demanding an immediate peace settlement.

Some historians have argued that it represented a traditionalistic element alarmed at the rapid modernization of society sponsored by the [[History of the Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]]. It looked back to [[Jacksonian Democracy]] for inspiration\u2014with ideals that promoted an agrarian rather than industrialized concept of society. Weber (2006) argues that the Copperheads damaged the Union war effort by fighting the draft, encouraging desertion and forming conspiracies.<ref>Jennifer L. Weber, ''Copperheads: The Rise and Fall of Lincoln's Opponents in the North'' (2006)</ref> However, other historians say the Copperheads were a legitimate opposition force unfairly treated by the government, adding that the draft was in disrepute and that the Republicans greatly exaggerated the conspiracies for partisan reasons.<ref>Frank L. Klement, ''Lincoln's Critics: The Copperheads of the North'' (1999)</ref> Copperheadism was a major issue in the 1864 presidential election\u2014its strength waxed when Union armies were doing poorly and waned when they won great victories. After the fall of [[Atlanta]] in September 1864, military success seemed assured and Copperheadism collapsed.<ref name=\"Cowden\"/>\n\n==Soldiers==\n===Recruiting volunteers===\n\n[[File:Georgetown 1861.jpg|thumb|right|Union soldiers on the Mason's Island (Theodore Roosevelt Island), 1861]]\n\nEnthusiastic young men clamored to join the Union army in 1861. They came with family support for reasons of patriotism and excitement. Washington decided to keep the small regular army intact; it had only 16,000 men and was needed to guard the frontier. Its officers could, however, join the temporary new volunteer army that was formed, with expectations that their experience would lead to rapid promotions. The problem with volunteering, however, was its serious lack of planning, leadership, and organization at the highest levels. Washington called on the states for troops, and every northern governor set about raising and equipping regiments, and sent the bills to the War Department. The men could elect the junior officers, while the governor appointed the senior officers, and Lincoln appointed the generals. Typically, politicians used their local organizations to raise troops and were in line (if healthy enough) to become colonel. The problem was that the War Department, under the disorganized leadership of [[Simon Cameron]], also authorized local and private groups to raise regiments. The result was widespread confusion and delay.\n\nPennsylvania, for example, had acute problems. When Washington called for 10 more regiments, enough men volunteered to form 30. However, they were scattered among 70 different new units, none of them a complete regiment. Not until Washington approved gubernatorial control of all new units was the problem resolved. Allan Nevins is particularly scathing of this in his analysis: \"A President more exact, systematic and vigilant than Lincoln, a Secretary more alert and clearheaded than Cameron, would have prevented these difficulties.\"<ref>{{cite book|author=Nevins, Allan |title=War for the Union: Vol 5.

The first wave in spring was called up for only 90 days, then the soldiers went home or reenlisted. Later waves enlisted for three years.\n\nThe new recruits spent their time drilling in company and regiment formations. The combat in the first year, though strategically important, involved relatively small forces and few casualties. Sickness was a much more serious cause of hospitalization or death.\n\nIn the first few months, men wore low quality uniforms made of \"shoddy\" material, but by fall, sturdy wool uniforms\u2014in blue\u2014were standard. The nation's factories were converted to produce the rifles, cannons, wagons, tents, telegraph sets, and the myriad of other special items the army needed.\n\nWhile business had been slow or depressed in spring 1861, because of war fears and Southern boycotts, by fall business was hiring again, offering young men jobs that were an alternative way to help win the war. Nonpartisanship was the rule in the first year, but by summer 1862, many Democrats had stopped supporting the war effort, and volunteering fell off sharply in their strongholds.\n\nThe calls for more and more soldiers continued, so states and localities responded by offering cash bonuses. By 1863, a draft law was in effect, but few men actually were drafted and served, since the law was designed to get them to volunteer or hire a substitute. Others hid away or left the country. With the [[Emancipation Proclamation]] taking effect in January 1863, localities could meet their draft quota by sponsoring regiments of ex-slaves organized in the South.<ref>{{cite book|author=Gallman, J.

Skills developed in insurance and financial companies formed the basis of systematic forms, copies, summaries, and filing systems used to make sense of masses of human data. The leader in this effort, [[John Shaw Billings]], later developed a system of mechanically storing, sorting, and counting numerical information using [[punch card]]s. Nevertheless, old-fashioned methodology had to be recognized and overcome. An illustrative case study came in New Hampshire, where the critical post of state adjutant general was held in 1861\u201364 by elderly politician Anthony C. Colby (1792\u20131873) and his son Daniel E. Colby (1816\u20131891). They were patriotic, but were overwhelmed with the complexity of their duties. The state lost track of men who enlisted after 1861; it had no personnel records or information on volunteers, substitutes, or draftees, and there was no inventory of weaponry and supplies. Nathaniel Head (1828\u20131883) took over in 1864, obtained an adequate budget and office staff, and reconstructed the missing paperwork. As result, widows, orphans, and disabled veterans received the postwar payments they had earned.<ref>Richard F.

The Union responded by building army hospitals in every state.\n\nThe hygiene of the camps was poor, especially at the beginning of the war when men who had seldom been far from home were brought together for training with thousands of strangers. First came epidemics of the childhood diseases of [[chicken pox]], [[mumps]], [[whooping cough]], and especially, [[measles]]. Operations in the South meant a dangerous and new disease environment, bringing [[diarrhea]], [[dysentery]], [[typhoid fever]], and [[malaria]]. There were no antibiotics, so the surgeons prescribed coffee, whiskey, and quinine. Harsh weather, bad water, inadequate shelter in winter quarters, poor policing of camps, and dirty camp hospitals took their toll.<ref>Kenneth Link, \"Potomac Fever: The Hazards of Camp Life,\" ''Vermont History'', April 1983, Vol. 51 Issue 2, pp 69\u201388</ref> This was a common scenario in wars from time immemorial, and conditions faced by the Confederate army were even worse. What was different in the Union was the emergence of skilled, well-funded medical organizers who took proactive action, especially in the much enlarged United States Army Medical Department,<ref>Mary C. Gillett, ''The Army Medical Department, 1818\u20131865'' (1987)</ref> and the [[United States Sanitary Commission]], a new private agency.<ref>William Quentin Maxwell, ''Lincoln's Fifth Wheel: The Political History of the U.S. Sanitary Commission'' (1956)</ref> Numerous other new agencies also targeted the medical and morale needs of soldiers, including the [[United States Christian Commission]], as well as smaller private agencies, such as the Women's Central Association of Relief for Sick and Wounded in the Army (WCAR), founded in 1861 by [[Henry Whitney Bellows]], a Unitarian minister, and the social reformer [[Dorothea Dix]]. Systematic funding appeals raised public consciousness as well as millions of dollars. Many thousands of volunteers worked in the hospitals and rest homes, most famously poet [[Walt Whitman]]. [[Frederick Law Olmsted]], a famous landscape architect, was the highly efficient executive director of the Sanitary Commission.<ref>Justin Martin, ''Genius of Place: The Life of Frederick Law Olmsted'' (2011) pp 178\u2013230</ref>\n\nStates could use their own tax money to support their troops, as Ohio did. Under the energetic leadership of Governor [[David Tod]], a [[War Democrat]] who won office on a coalition \"Union Party\" ticket with Republicans, Ohio acted vigorously. Following the unexpected carnage at the [[battle of Shiloh]] in April 1862, Ohio sent three steamboats to the scene as floating hospitals equipped with doctors, nurses, and medical supplies. The state fleet expanded to 11 hospital ships, and the state set up 12 local offices in main transportation nodes, to help Ohio soldiers moving back and forth.<ref>Eugene E.

For example, [[Mary Livermore]] (1820\u20131905), the manager of the Chicago branch of the US Sanitary Commission, used her newfound organizational skills to mobilize support for [[women's suffrage]] after the war. She argued that women needed more education and job opportunities to help them fulfill their role of serving others.<ref>Wendy Hamand Venet, \"The Emergence of a Suffragist: Mary Livermore, Civil War activism, and the Moral Power of Women,\" ''Civil War History'', June 2002, Vol. 48 Issue 2, pp 143\u201364 [http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/cwh/summary/v048/48.2venet.html in Project MUSE]</ref>\n\nThe Sanitary Commission collected enormous amounts of statistical data, and opened up the problems of storing information for fast access and mechanically searching for data patterns.<ref>James H.

A senior surgeon in the war, Billings built two of the world's most important libraries, [[Library of the Surgeon General's Office]] (now the [[National Library of Medicine]]) and the [[New York Public Library]]; he also figured out how to mechanically analyze data by turning it into numbers and punching onto the computer punch card as developed by his student [[Herman Hollerith]].

The Record and Pension Office in 1901 counted 211,000 Northerners who were captured. In 1861\u201363 most were immediately paroled; after the parole exchange system broke down in 1863, about 195,000 went to Confederate prison camps. Some tried to escape but few succeeded. By contrast 464,000 Confederates were captured (many in the final days) and 215,000 imprisoned. Over 30,000 Union and nearly 26,000 Confederate prisoners died in captivity. Just over 12% of the captives in Northern prisons died, compared to 15.5% for Southern prisons.<ref>{{cite book|author=James Ford Rhodes|title=History of the United States from the Compromise of 1850: 1864\u20131866|url=https://archive.org/details/historyunitedst20unkngoog|year=1904|publisher=Harper & Brothers|pages=[https://archive.org/details/historyunitedst20unkngoog/page/n529 507]\u20138}}</ref><ref>Michael B.

The South had resisted policies such as tariffs to promote industry and homestead laws to promote farming because slavery would not benefit. With the South gone and Northern Democrats weak, the Republicans enacted their legislation. At the same time they passed new taxes to pay for part of the war and issued large amounts of bonds to pay for most of the rest. Economic historians attribute the remainder of the cost of the war to inflation. Congress wrote an elaborate program of economic [[modernization]] that had the dual purpose of winning the war and permanently transforming the economy.<ref>Heather Cox Richardson, ''The Greatest Nation of the Earth: Republican Economic Policies during the Civil War'' (1997)</ref> For a list of the major industrialists see .\n\n===Financing the war===\n\nIn 1860 the Treasury was a small operation that funded the small-scale operations of the government through land sales and customs based on a low tariff.<ref>Jane Flaherty, \"'The Exhausted Condition of the Treasury' on the Eve of the Civil War,\" ''Civil War History'', (2009) 55#2 pp. 244\u2013277 [http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/civil_war_history/v055/55.2.flaherty.html in Project MUSE]</ref> Peacetime revenues were trivial in comparison with the cost of a full-scale war but the Treasury Department under Secretary [[Salmon P. Chase]] showed unusual ingenuity in financing the war without crippling the economy.<ref>John Niven, ''Salmon P. Chase: a biography'' (1995) p. 331</ref> Many new taxes were imposed and always with a patriotic theme comparing the financial sacrifice to the sacrifices of life and limb. The government paid for supplies in real money, which encouraged people to sell to the government regardless of their politics. By contrast the Confederacy gave paper promissory notes when it seized property, so that even loyal Confederates would hide their horses and mules rather than sell them for dubious paper. Overall the Northern financial system was highly successful in raising money and turning patriotism into profit, while the Confederate system impoverished its patriots.<ref>Jane Flaherty, ''The revenue imperative'' (2009)</ref>\n\nThe United States needed $3.1 billion to pay for the immense armies and fleets raised to fight the Civil War\u2014over $400&nbsp;million just in 1862 alone.<ref>Jerry W.

Second came much higher tariffs, through several [[Morrill tariff]] laws. Third came the nation's first income tax; only the wealthy paid and it was repealed at war's end.\n[[File:Demand Legal comparison.jpg|thumb|upright=1.1|1862 Greenbacks]]\n\nApart from taxes, the second major source of income was government bonds. For the first time bonds in small denominations were sold directly to the people, with publicity and patriotism as key factors, as designed by banker [[Jay Cooke]]. State banks lost their power to issue banknotes. Only national banks could do that and Chase made it easy to become a national bank; it involved buying and holding federal bonds and financiers rushed to open these banks. Chase numbered them, so that the first one in each city was the \"First National Bank\".<ref>Bray Hammond, ''Sovereignty and the Empty Purse: Banks and Politics in the Civil War'' (1970).</ref> Third, the government printed paper money called \"[[United States Note|greenbacks]]\". They led to endless controversy because they caused inflation.<ref>Wesley C.

Even more important, the hundreds of new banks that were allowed to open were required to purchase government bonds. Thereby the nation monetized the potential wealth represented by farms, urban buildings, factories, and businesses, and immediately turned that money over to the Treasury for war needs.<ref>Hammond, ''Sovereignty and the Empty Purse: Banks and Politics in the Civil War'' (1970).</ref>\n\n====Tariffs====\n\nSecretary Chase, though a long-time free-trader, worked with Morrill to pass a second tariff bill in summer 1861, raising rates another 10&nbsp;points in order to generate more revenues.<ref>Richardson, 100, 113</ref> These subsequent bills were primarily revenue driven to meet the war's needs, though they enjoyed the support of protectionists such as Carey, who again assisted Morrill in the bill's drafting. The [[Morrill Tariff]] of 1861 was designed to raise revenue. The tariff act of 1862 served not only to raise revenue but also to encourage the establishment of factories free from British competition by taxing British imports. Furthermore, it protected American factory workers from low paid European workers, and as a major bonus attracted tens of thousands of those Europeans to immigrate to America for high wage factory and craftsman jobs.<ref>{{Cite journal |jstor = 1890520|title = A Political Response to Industrialism: The Republican Embrace of Protectionist Labor Doctrines|journal = The Journal of American History|volume = 70|issue = 1|pages = 35\u201357|last1 = Huston|first1 = James L.|year = 1983|doi = 10.2307/1890520}}</ref>\n\nCustoms revenue from tariffs totaled $345&nbsp;million from 1861 through 1865 or 43% of all federal tax revenue.\n\n===Land grants===\n\nThe U.S. government owned vast amounts of good land (mostly from the Louisiana Purchase of 1803 and the Oregon Treaty with Britain in 1846). The challenge was to make the land useful to people and to provide the economic basis for the wealth that would pay off the war debt. Land grants went to railroad construction companies to open up the western plains and link up to California. Together with the free lands provided farmers by the Homestead Law the low-cost farm lands provided by the land grants sped up the expansion of commercial agriculture in the West.\n\nThe 1862 Homestead Act opened up the public domain lands for free. Land grants to the railroads meant they could sell tracts for family farms (80 to 200 acres) at low prices with extended credit. In addition the government sponsored fresh information, scientific methods and the latest techniques through the newly established [[United States Department of Agriculture|Department of Agriculture]] and the Morrill Land Grant College Act.<ref>Harold M.

He blamed Jewish traders and [[General Order No. 11 (1862)|expelled them from his lines in 1862]] but Lincoln quickly overruled this show of anti-semitism. Critics said the cotton trade helped the South, prolonged the war and fostered corruption. Lincoln decided to continue the trade for fear that Britain might intervene if its textile manufacturers were denied raw material. Another goal was to foster latent Unionism in Southern border states. Northern textile manufacturers needed cotton to remain in business and to make uniforms, while cotton exports to Europe provided an important source of gold to finance the war.<ref>David S.

In general, the pietistic denominations such as the Methodists, Northern Baptists and Congregationalists strongly supported the war effort. Catholics, Episcopalians, Lutherans and conservative Presbyterians generally avoided any discussion of the war, so it would not bitterly divide their membership. The Quakers, while giving strong support to the abolitionist movement on a personal level, refused to take a denominational position. Some clergymen who supported the Confederacy were denounced as Copperheads, especially in the border regions.<ref>Timothy L. Wesley.

No denomination was more active in supporting the Union than the [[Methodist Episcopal Church]]. Carwardine<ref name=Carwardine/> argues that for many Methodists, the victory of Lincoln in 1860 heralded the arrival of the kingdom of God in America. They were moved into action by a vision of freedom for slaves, freedom from the persecutions of godly abolitionists, release from the [[Slave Power]]'s evil grip on the American government and the promise of a new direction for the Union.<ref name=Carwardine>{{Cite journal |jstor = 3169398|title = Methodists, Politics, and the Coming of the American Civil War|journal = Church History|volume = 69|issue = 3|pages = 578\u2013609|last1 = Carwardine|first1 = Richard|year = 2000|doi = 10.2307/3169398}}</ref> Methodists formed a major element of the popular support for the [[Radical Republicans]] with their hard line toward the white South.

Its articles provided moral uplift to women and children. It portrayed the War as a great moral crusade against a decadent Southern civilization corrupted by slavery. It recommended activities that family members could perform in order to aid the Union cause.<ref>Kathleen L.

Frank reports that what it meant to be a father varied with status and age. He says most men demonstrated dual commitments as providers and nurturers and believed that husband and wife had mutual obligations toward their children. The war privileged masculinity, dramatizing and exaggerating, father-son bonds. Especially at five critical stages in the soldier's career (enlistment, blooding, mustering out, wounding and death) letters from absent fathers articulated a distinctive set of 19th-century ideals of manliness.<ref>{{Cite journal |jstor = 3788810|title = \"Rendering Aid and Comfort\": Images of Fatherhood in the Letters of Civil War Soldiers from Massachusetts and Michigan|journal = Journal of Social History|volume = 26|issue = 1|pages = 5\u201331|last1 = Frank|first1 = Stephen M.|year = 1992|doi = 10.1353/jsh/26.1.5}}</ref>\n\n====Children====\n\nThere were numerous children's magazines, such as ''Merry's Museum'', ''The Student and Schoolmate'', ''Our Young Folks'', ''The Little Pilgrim'', ''Forrester's Playmate'' and ''The Little Corporal''. They showed a Protestant religious tone and \"promoted the principles of hard work, obedience, generosity, humility, and piety; trumpeted the benefits of family cohesion; and furnished mild adventure stories, innocent entertainment, and instruction\".<ref>James Marten, ''Children for the Union: The War Spirit of the Northern Home Front'' (2004) p. 17</ref> Their pages featured factual information and anecdotes about the war along with related quizzes, games, poems, songs, short oratorical pieces for \"declamation\", short stories and very short plays that children could stage. They promoted patriotism and the Union war aims, fostered kindly attitudes toward freed slaves, blackened the Confederates cause, encouraged readers to raise money for war-related humanitarian funds, and dealt with the death of family members.<ref>James Marten, \"For the good, the true, and the beautiful: Northern children's magazines and the Civil War,\" ''Civil War History'', March 1995, Vol. 41 Issue 1, pp 57\u201375</ref> By 1866, the Milton Bradley Company was selling \"The Myriopticon: A Historical Panorama of the Rebellion\" that allowed children to stage a neighborhood show that would explain the war. It comprised colorful drawings that were turned on wheels and included pre-printed tickets, poster advertisements, and narration that could be read aloud at the show.<ref>James Marten, \"History in a Box: Milton Bradley's Myriopticon,\" ''Journal of the History of Childhood & Youth'', Winter 2009, Vol.{{nbsp}}2 Issue 1, pp 5\u20137</ref>\n\nCaring for war orphans was an important function for local organizations as well as state and local government.<ref>Marten, ''Children for the Union'' pp 107, 166</ref> A typical state was Iowa, where the private \"Iowa Soldiers Orphans Home Association\" operated with funding from the legislature and public donations. It set up orphanages in Davenport, Glenwood and Cedar Falls.

These orphan schools were created to provide housing, care, and education for orphans of Civil War soldiers. They became a matter of state pride, with orphans were paraded around at rallies to display the power of a patriotic schooling.<ref>James Marten, \"Children and Youth during the Civil War Era,\" (New York University Press) Winter 2012, pp 188\u2013195</ref>\n\nAll the northern states had free public school systems before the war but not the border states. West Virginia set up its system in 1863. Over bitter opposition it established an almost-equal education for black children, most of whom were ex-slaves.<ref>F.

Confederates sometimes styled them \"Homemade Yankees\". However, Southern Unionists were not necessarily northern sympathizers and many of them, although opposing secession, supported the Confederacy once it was a fact. East Tennessee never supported the Confederacy, and Unionists there became powerful state leaders, including governors [[Andrew Johnson]] and [[William G. Brownlow]]. Likewise, large pockets of eastern Kentucky were Unionist and helped keep the state from seceding.<ref>Kent Dollar et al. eds. ''Sister States, Enemy States: The Civil War in Kentucky and Tennessee'' (2009)</ref> Western Virginia, with few slaves and some industry, was so strongly Unionist that it broke away and formed the new state of [[West Virginia in the American Civil War|West Virginia]].<ref>William A. Link, \"'This Bastard New Virginia': Slavery, West Virginia Exceptionalism, and the Secession Crisis,\" ''West Virginia History'', Spring 2009, Vol.{{nbsp}}3 Issue 1, pp 37\u201356</ref>\n\nStill, nearly 120,000 Unionists from the South served in the [[Union Army]] during the Civil War and Unionist regiments were raised from every Confederate state except South Carolina. Among such units was the 1st Alabama Cavalry Regiment, which served as William Sherman's personal escort on his march to the sea. [[Southern Unionist]]s were extensively used as anti-guerrilla paramilitary forces.<ref>Richard N. Current, ''Lincoln's Loyalists: Union Soldiers from the Confederacy'' (1994)</ref> During Reconstruction many of these Unionists became \"[[Scalawags]]\", a derogatory term for Southern supporters of the Republican Party.<ref>James Alex Baggett, ''The Scalawags: Southern Dissenters in the Civil War and Reconstruction'' (2003)</ref>\n\n===Guerrilla warfare===\n\nBesides organized military conflict, the border states were beset by [[guerrilla warfare]]. In such a bitterly divided state, neighbors frequently used the excuse of war to settle personal grudges and took up arms against neighbors.\n\n====Missouri====\n\n{{main|Missouri in the Civil War}}\n\n[[File:Battle of Lawrence.png|thumb|Quantrill's 1863 raid burned the town of [[Lawrence Massacre|Lawrence]] and killed 164 defenders.]]\n\nMissouri was the scene of over 1,000 engagements between Union and Confederate forces, and uncounted numbers of guerrilla attacks and raids by informal pro-Confederate bands.<ref>Michael Fellman, ''Inside War: The Guerrilla Conflict in Missouri during the Civil War'' (1989)</ref> Western Missouri was the scene of brutal guerrilla warfare during the Civil War. Roving insurgent bands such as [[Quantrill's Raiders]] and the men of [[Bloody Bill Anderson]] terrorized the countryside, striking both military installations and civilian settlements. Because of the widespread attacks and the protection offered by Confederate sympathizers, Federal leaders issued [[General Order \u2116 11 (1863)|General Order No. 11]] in 1863, and evacuated areas of Jackson, Cass, and Bates counties. They forced the residents out to reduce support for the guerrillas. Union cavalry could sweep through and track down Confederate guerrillas, who no longer had places to hide and people and infrastructure to support them. On short notice, the army forced almost 20,000 people, mostly women, children and the elderly, to leave their homes. Many never returned and the affected counties were economically devastated for years after the end of the war.<ref>Sarah Bohl, \"A War on Civilians: Order Number 11 and the Evacuation of Western Missouri,\" ''Prologue'', April 2004, Vol. 36 Issue 1, pp 44\u201351</ref> Families passed along stories of their bitter experiences down through several generations\u2014[[Harry Truman]]'s grandparents were caught up in the raids and he would tell of how they were kept in concentration camps.<ref>Michael R. Gardner, et al. ''Harry Truman and Civil Rights: Moral Courage and Political Risks'' (2003) p. 4</ref>\n\nSome marauding units became organized criminal gangs after the war. In 1882, the bank robber and ex-Confederate guerrilla [[Jesse James]] was killed in [[Saint Joseph, Missouri|Saint Joseph]]. Vigilante groups appeared in remote areas where law enforcement was weak, to deal with the lawlessness left over from the guerrilla warfare phase. For example, the [[Bald Knobbers]] were the term for several law-and-order vigilante groups in the Ozarks. In some cases, they too turned to illegal gang activity.<ref>Elmo Ingenthron and Hartman, ''Bald Knobbers: Vigilantes on the Ozarks Frontier'' (1988)</ref>\n\n====Kentucky====\n\n{{main|Kentucky in the Civil War}}\n\nIn response to the growing problem of locally organized guerrilla campaigns throughout 1863 and 1864, in June 1864, Maj. Gen. [[Stephen G. Burbridge]] was given command over the state of Kentucky. This began an extended period of military control that would last through early 1865, beginning with [[martial law]] authorized by President [[Abraham Lincoln]]. To pacify Kentucky, Burbridge rigorously suppressed disloyalty and used economic pressure as coercion. His guerrilla policy, which included public execution of four guerrillas for the death of each unarmed Union citizen, caused the most controversy. After a falling out with Governor [[Thomas E. Bramlette]], Burbridge was dismissed in February 1865. Confederates remembered him as the \"Butcher of Kentucky\".<ref>Louis De Falaise, \"General Stephen Gano Burbridge's Command in Kentucky,\" ''Register of the Kentucky Historical Society'', April 1971, Vol. 69 Issue 2, pp 101\u2013127</ref>\n\n==Union states==\n\n* [[Washington, D.C. in the American Civil War|Washington, D.C]]\nList of Wikipedia articles on Union states and major cities:\n{{col-begin}}\n{{col-1-of-5}}\n* [[California in the American Civil War|California]]\n* [[Connecticut in the American Civil War|Connecticut]]\n* [[Delaware in the American Civil War|Delaware]]<nowiki>*</nowiki>\n* [[Illinois in the American Civil War|Illinois]]\n* [[Indiana in the American Civil War|Indiana]]\n** [[Indianapolis in the American Civil War|Indianapolis]]\n* [[Iowa in the American Civil War|Iowa]]\n* [[Kansas in the American Civil War|Kansas]]\n{{col-2-of-5}}\n* [[Kentucky in the American Civil War|Kentucky]]<nowiki>\u2020*</nowiki>\n** [[Lexington in the American Civil War|Lexington]]\n** [[Louisville in the American Civil War|Louisville]]\n* [[Maine in the American Civil War|Maine]]\n* [[Maryland in the American Civil War|Maryland]]<nowiki>*</nowiki>\n** [[Baltimore riot of 1861|Baltimore]]\n\n{{col-3-of-5}}\n* [[Massachusetts in the American Civil War|Massachusetts]]\n* [[Michigan in the American Civil War|Michigan]]\n* [[Minnesota in the American Civil War|Minnesota]]\n* [[Missouri in the American Civil War|Missouri]]<nowiki>\u2020*</nowiki>\n** [[St. Louis in the American Civil War|St. Louis]]\n* [[Nevada in the American Civil War|Nevada]]\n* [[New Hampshire in the American Civil War|New Hampshire]]\n{{col-4-of-5}}\n* [[New Jersey in the American Civil War|New Jersey]]\n* [[New York in the American Civil War|New York]]\n** [[New York City in the American Civil War|New York City]]\n* [[Ohio in the American Civil War|Ohio]]\n** [[Cincinnati in the American Civil War|Cincinnati]]\n** [[Cleveland in the American Civil War|Cleveland]]\n* [[Oregon in the American Civil War|Oregon]]\n{{col-5-of-5}}\n* [[Pennsylvania in the American Civil War|Pennsylvania]]\n** [[Harrisburg in the American Civil War|Harrisburg]]\n** [[Philadelphia in the American Civil War|Philadelphia]]\n** [[Pittsburgh in the American Civil War|Pittsburgh]]\n* [[Rhode Island in the American Civil War|Rhode Island]]\n* [[Vermont in the American Civil War|Vermont]]\n* [[Virginia in the American Civil War|Virginia]]\u2020*\n* [[West Virginia in the American Civil War|West Virginia]]*\n* [[Wisconsin in the American Civil War|Wisconsin]]\n{{col-end}}\n<nowiki>*</nowiki> [[Border states (American Civil War)|Border states]] with slavery in 1861\n\n\u2020Had two state governments, one Unionist one Confederate, both claiming to be the legitimate government of their state.

Prosperity was stimulated by heavy government spending and the creation of an entirely new national banking system. The Union states invested a great deal of money and effort in organizing psychological and social support for soldiers' wives, widows, and orphans, and for the soldiers themselves. Most soldiers were volunteers, although after 1862 many volunteered in order to escape the draft and to take advantage of generous cash bounties on offer from states and localities. Draft resistance was notable in some larger cities, especially [[New York City draft riots|New York City]] with its massive anti-draft riots of July 1863 and in some remote districts such as the coal mining areas of Pennsylvania.\n\n==Etymology==\n\n[[File: Charleston Mercury Secession Broadside, 1860.jpg|thumb|[[Charleston Mercury]] Secession Broadside, 1860\u2014\"The Union\" had been a way to refer to the American Republic.]]\n\nIn the context of the American Civil War, the Union is sometimes referred to as \"the North\", both then and now, as opposed to the Confederacy, which was \"the South\". The Union never recognized the legitimacy of the Confederacy's secession and maintained at all times that it remained entirely a part of the United States of America. In foreign affairs the Union was the only side recognized by all other nations, none of which officially recognized the Confederate government. The term \"Union\" occurs in the first governing document of the United States, the [[Articles of Confederation|'' Articles of Confederation and Perpetual Union.'']] The subsequent [[United States Constitution|Constitution]] of 1787 was issued and ratified in the name not of the states, but of \"We the People of the United States, in order to form a more perfect Union{{nbsp}}...\" ''Union'', for the United States of America, is then repeated in such clauses as the [[Admission to the Union]] clause in Article IV, Section 3.\n\nEven before the war started, the phrase \"preserve the Union\" was commonplace, and a \"union of states\" had been used to refer to the entire United States of America. Using the term \"Union\" to apply to the non-secessionist tee hee side carried a connotation of legitimacy as the continuation of the pre-existing political entity.<ref>{{cite news|author=Stampp, Kenneth M. |title=The Concept of a Perpetual Union|work=The Imperiled Union: Essays on the Background of the Civil War|date=1980|page=30}}</ref>\n\nConfederates generally saw the Union as being opposed to slavery, occasionally referring to them as abolitionists, as in reference to the U.S. Navy as the \"Abolition fleet\" and the U.S. Army as the \"Abolition forces\".<ref>{{Cite book|url=http://civilwartalk.com/threads/did-the-southern-soldier-fight-and-die-to-preserve-slavery.117485/page-22#post-1198090|title=The war of the rebellion: a compilation of the official records of the Union and Confederate armies|series=1|volume=14|pages=185\u20131,015|accessdate=March 19, 2016}}</ref>\n\n==Size and strength==\n\n[[File:Advantages.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.25|The Union had large advantages in men and resources at the start of the war, and the ratio grew steadily in favor of the Union.

Meanwhile, the Union turned its growing potential advantage into a much stronger military force. However, much of the Union strength had to be used to garrison conquered areas, and to protect railroads and other vital points.

Voters became afraid of power being centralized in Washington, extravagant spending, and war profiteering. Democratic candidates emphasized these fears. The candidates added that rapid modernization was putting too much political power in the hands of Eastern financiers and industrialists. They warned that the abolition of slavery would bring a flood of freed blacks into the labor market of the North.\n\nRepublicans responded with claims of defeatism. They indicted Copperheads for criminal conspiracies to free Confederate [[Prisoner of war|prisoners of war]], and played on the spirit of nationalism and the growing hatred of the slave owners, as the guilty party in the war.<ref>{{cite book|author=Smith, Michael Thomas |title=The Enemy Within: Fears of Corruption in the Civil War North|date=2011}}</ref>\n\n==President Lincoln==\n\n{{main|Presidency of Abraham Lincoln}}\n\nHistorians have [[Historical rankings of Presidents of the United States|overwhelmingly praised]] the \"political genius\" of Abraham Lincoln's performance as President.<ref>{{cite book|author=Goodwin, Doris Kearns |title=Team of Rivals: The Political Genius of Abraham Lincoln|url=https://archive.org/details/teamofrivalspoli00good |url-access=registration |date=2005}}</ref> His first priority was military victory. This required that he master entirely new skills as a strategist and diplomat. He oversaw supplies, finances, manpower, the selection of generals, and the course of overall strategy. Working closely with state and local politicians, he rallied public opinion and (at [[Gettysburg Address|Gettysburg]]) articulated a national mission that has defined America ever since. Lincoln's charm and willingness to cooperate with political and personal enemies made Washington work much more smoothly than [[Richmond, VA|Richmond]], the Confederate capital, and his wit smoothed many rough edges. Lincoln's cabinet proved much stronger and more efficient than Davis's, as Lincoln channeled personal rivalries into a competition for excellence rather than mutual destruction. With [[William H. Seward|William Seward]] at [[State Department|State]], [[Salmon P. Chase]] at the [[United States Department of the Treasury|Treasury]], and (from 1862) [[Edwin Stanton]] at the [[United States Department of War|War Department]], Lincoln had a powerful [[Cabinet (government)|cabinet]] of determined men. Except for monitoring major appointments and decisions, Lincoln gave them free rein to end the Confederate rebellion.<ref>{{cite book|author=Paludsn, Phillip Shaw |title=The Presidency of Abraham Lincoln|date=1994|pages=21\u201348}}</ref>\n\n==Congress==\n\nThe Republican Congress passed many major laws that reshaped the nation's economy, financial system, tax system, land system, and higher education system. These included: the [[Morrill tariff]], the [[Homestead Act]], the [[Pacific Railroad Act]], and the [[National Banking Act]].<ref>Leonard P. Curry, ''Blueprint for Modern America: Nonmilitary Legislation of the First Civil War Congress'' (1968)</ref> Lincoln paid relatively little attention to this legislation as he focused on war issues but he worked smoothly with powerful Congressional leaders such as [[Thaddeus Stevens]] (on taxation and spending), [[Charles Sumner]] (on foreign affairs), [[Lyman Trumbull]] (on legal issues), [[Justin Smith Morrill]] (on land grants and tariffs) and [[William Pitt Fessenden]] (on finances).<ref>Robert Cook, \"Stiffening Abe: William Pitt Fessenden and the Role of the Broker Politician in the Civil War Congress,\" ''American Nineteenth Century History'', June 2007, Vol.{{nbsp}}8 Issue 2, pp 145\u2013167</ref>\n\nMilitary and reconstruction issues were another matter. Lincoln, as the leader of the moderate and conservative factions of the Republican Party, often crossed swords with the [[Radical Republicans]], led by Stevens and Sumner. Author, Bruce Tap, shows that Congress challenged Lincoln's role as commander-in-chief through the [[Joint Committee on the Conduct of the War]]. It was a joint committee of both houses that was dominated by the Radical Republicans, who took a hard line against the Confederacy. During the 37th and 38th Congresses, the committee investigated every aspect of Union military operations, with special attention to finding commanders culpable for military defeats. It assumed an inevitable Union victory. Failure was perceived to indicate evil motivations or personal failures. The committee distrusted graduates of the US Military Academy at West Point, since many of the academy's alumni were leaders of the enemy army. Members of the committee much preferred political generals with a satisfactory political record. Some of the committee suggested that West-Pointers who engaged in strategic maneuver were cowardly or even disloyal. It ended up endorsing incompetent but politically correct generals.<ref>Bruce Tap, \"Inevitability, masculinity, and the American military tradition: the committee on the conduct of the war investigates the American Civil War,\" ''American Nineteenth Century History'', (2004) 5#2 pp 19\u201346</ref>\n\n===Opposition===\n\n[[File:~abe2.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Anti-Lincoln Copperhead pamphlet from 1864]]\n\nThe opposition came from [[Copperhead (politics)|Copperhead Democrats]], who were strongest in the Midwest and wanted to allow Confederate secession. In the East, opposition to the war was strongest among Irish Catholics, but also included business interests connected to the South typified by [[August Belmont]]. The [[History of the Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]] was deeply split. In 1861 most Democrats supported the war. However, the party increasingly split down the middle between the moderates who supported the war effort, and the peace element, including Copperheads, who did not. It scored major gains in the 1862 elections, and elected the moderate [[Horatio Seymour]] as governor of New York.

Some historians have argued that it represented a traditionalistic element alarmed at the rapid modernization of society sponsored by the [[History of the Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]]. It looked back to [[Jacksonian Democracy]] for inspiration\u2014with ideals that promoted an agrarian rather than industrialized concept of society. Weber (2006) argues that the Copperheads damaged the Union war effort by fighting the draft, encouraging desertion and forming conspiracies.<ref>Jennifer L. Weber, ''Copperheads: The Rise and Fall of Lincoln's Opponents in the North'' (2006)</ref> However, other historians say the Copperheads were a legitimate opposition force unfairly treated by the government, adding that the draft was in disrepute and that the Republicans greatly exaggerated the conspiracies for partisan reasons.<ref>Frank L. Klement, ''Lincoln's Critics: The Copperheads of the North'' (1999)</ref> Copperheadism was a major issue in the 1864 presidential election\u2014its strength waxed when Union armies were doing poorly and waned when they won great victories. After the fall of [[Atlanta]] in September 1864, military success seemed assured and Copperheadism collapsed.<ref name=\"Cowden\"/>\n\n==Soldiers==\n===Recruiting volunteers===\n\n[[File:Georgetown 1861.jpg|thumb|right|Union soldiers on the Mason's Island (Theodore Roosevelt Island), 1861]]\n\nEnthusiastic young men clamored to join the Union army in 1861. They came with family support for reasons of patriotism and excitement. Washington decided to keep the small regular army intact; it had only 16,000 men and was needed to guard the frontier. Its officers could, however, join the temporary new volunteer army that was formed, with expectations that their experience would lead to rapid promotions. The problem with volunteering, however, was its serious lack of planning, leadership, and organization at the highest levels. Washington called on the states for troops, and every northern governor set about raising and equipping regiments, and sent the bills to the War Department. The men could elect the junior officers, while the governor appointed the senior officers, and Lincoln appointed the generals. Typically, politicians used their local organizations to raise troops and were in line (if healthy enough) to become colonel. The problem was that the War Department, under the disorganized leadership of [[Simon Cameron]], also authorized local and private groups to raise regiments. The result was widespread confusion and delay.\n\nPennsylvania, for example, had acute problems. When Washington called for 10 more regiments, enough men volunteered to form 30. However, they were scattered among 70 different new units, none of them a complete regiment. Not until Washington approved gubernatorial control of all new units was the problem resolved. Allan Nevins is particularly scathing of this in his analysis: \"A President more exact, systematic and vigilant than Lincoln, a Secretary more alert and clearheaded than Cameron, would have prevented these difficulties.\"<ref>{{cite book|author=Nevins, Allan |title=War for the Union: Vol 5. The Improvised War, 1861\u20131862|date=1959|page= 235}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Union soldiers entrenched along the west bank of the Rappahannock River at Fredericksburg, Virginia (111-B-157).jpg|thumb|Union soldiers before Marye's Heights, [[Second Battle of Fredericksburg|Fredericksburg]], May 1863]]\n\nBy the end of 1861, 700,000 soldiers were drilling in Union camps. The first wave in spring was called up for only 90 days, then the soldiers went home or reenlisted. Later waves enlisted for three years.\n\nThe new recruits spent their time drilling in company and regiment formations. The combat in the first year, though strategically important, involved relatively small forces and few casualties. Sickness was a much more serious cause of hospitalization or death.\n\nIn the first few months, men wore low quality uniforms made of \"shoddy\" material, but by fall, sturdy wool uniforms\u2014in blue\u2014were standard. The nation's factories were converted to produce the rifles, cannons, wagons, tents, telegraph sets, and the myriad of other special items the army needed.\n\nWhile business had been slow or depressed in spring 1861, because of war fears and Southern boycotts, by fall business was hiring again, offering young men jobs that were an alternative way to help win the war. Nonpartisanship was the rule in the first year, but by summer 1862, many Democrats had stopped supporting the war effort, and volunteering fell off sharply in their strongholds.\n\nThe calls for more and more soldiers continued, so states and localities responded by offering cash bonuses. By 1863, a draft law was in effect, but few men actually were drafted and served, since the law was designed to get them to volunteer or hire a substitute. Others hid away or left the country. With the [[Emancipation Proclamation]] taking effect in January 1863, localities could meet their draft quota by sponsoring regiments of ex-slaves organized in the South.<ref>{{cite book|author=Gallman, J.

Skills developed in insurance and financial companies formed the basis of systematic forms, copies, summaries, and filing systems used to make sense of masses of human data. The leader in this effort, [[John Shaw Billings]], later developed a system of mechanically storing, sorting, and counting numerical information using [[punch card]]s. Nevertheless, old-fashioned methodology had to be recognized and overcome. An illustrative case study came in New Hampshire, where the critical post of state adjutant general was held in 1861\u201364 by elderly politician Anthony C. Colby (1792\u20131873) and his son Daniel E. Colby (1816\u20131891). They were patriotic, but were overwhelmed with the complexity of their duties. The state lost track of men who enlisted after 1861; it had no personnel records or information on volunteers, substitutes, or draftees, and there was no inventory of weaponry and supplies. Nathaniel Head (1828\u20131883) took over in 1864, obtained an adequate budget and office staff, and reconstructed the missing paperwork. As result, widows, orphans, and disabled veterans received the postwar payments they had earned.<ref>Richard F.

The Union responded by building army hospitals in every state.\n\nThe hygiene of the camps was poor, especially at the beginning of the war when men who had seldom been far from home were brought together for training with thousands of strangers. First came epidemics of the childhood diseases of [[chicken pox]], [[mumps]], [[whooping cough]], and especially, [[measles]]. Operations in the South meant a dangerous and new disease environment, bringing [[diarrhea]], [[dysentery]], [[typhoid fever]], and [[malaria]]. There were no antibiotics, so the surgeons prescribed coffee, whiskey, and quinine. Harsh weather, bad water, inadequate shelter in winter quarters, poor policing of camps, and dirty camp hospitals took their toll.<ref>Kenneth Link, \"Potomac Fever: The Hazards of Camp Life,\" ''Vermont History'', April 1983, Vol. 51 Issue 2, pp 69\u201388</ref> This was a common scenario in wars from time immemorial, and conditions faced by the Confederate army were even worse. What was different in the Union was the emergence of skilled, well-funded medical organizers who took proactive action, especially in the much enlarged United States Army Medical Department,<ref>Mary C. Gillett, ''The Army Medical Department, 1818\u20131865'' (1987)</ref> and the [[United States Sanitary Commission]], a new private agency.<ref>William Quentin Maxwell, ''Lincoln's Fifth Wheel: The Political History of the U.S. Sanitary Commission'' (1956)</ref> Numerous other new agencies also targeted the medical and morale needs of soldiers, including the [[United States Christian Commission]], as well as smaller private agencies, such as the Women's Central Association of Relief for Sick and Wounded in the Army (WCAR), founded in 1861 by [[Henry Whitney Bellows]], a Unitarian minister, and the social reformer [[Dorothea Dix]]. Systematic funding appeals raised public consciousness as well as millions of dollars. Many thousands of volunteers worked in the hospitals and rest homes, most famously poet [[Walt Whitman]]. [[Frederick Law Olmsted]], a famous landscape architect, was the highly efficient executive director of the Sanitary Commission.<ref>Justin Martin, ''Genius of Place: The Life of Frederick Law Olmsted'' (2011) pp 178\u2013230</ref>\n\nStates could use their own tax money to support their troops, as Ohio did. Under the energetic leadership of Governor [[David Tod]], a [[War Democrat]] who won office on a coalition \"Union Party\" ticket with Republicans, Ohio acted vigorously. Following the unexpected carnage at the [[battle of Shiloh]] in April 1862, Ohio sent three steamboats to the scene as floating hospitals equipped with doctors, nurses, and medical supplies. The state fleet expanded to 11 hospital ships, and the state set up 12 local offices in main transportation nodes, to help Ohio soldiers moving back and forth.<ref>Eugene E.

For example, [[Mary Livermore]] (1820\u20131905), the manager of the Chicago branch of the US Sanitary Commission, used her newfound organizational skills to mobilize support for [[women's suffrage]] after the war. She argued that women needed more education and job opportunities to help them fulfill their role of serving others.<ref>Wendy Hamand Venet, \"The Emergence of a Suffragist: Mary Livermore, Civil War activism, and the Moral Power of Women,\" ''Civil War History'', June 2002, Vol. 48 Issue 2, pp 143\u201364 [http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/cwh/summary/v048/48.2venet.html in Project MUSE]</ref>\n\nThe Sanitary Commission collected enormous amounts of statistical data, and opened up the problems of storing information for fast access and mechanically searching for data patterns.<ref>James H.

A senior surgeon in the war, Billings built two of the world's most important libraries, [[Library of the Surgeon General's Office]] (now the [[National Library of Medicine]]) and the [[New York Public Library]]; he also figured out how to mechanically analyze data by turning it into numbers and punching onto the computer punch card as developed by his student [[Herman Hollerith]].

The Record and Pension Office in 1901 counted 211,000 Northerners who were captured. In 1861\u201363 most were immediately paroled; after the parole exchange system broke down in 1863, about 195,000 went to Confederate prison camps. Some tried to escape but few succeeded. By contrast 464,000 Confederates were captured (many in the final days) and 215,000 imprisoned. Over 30,000 Union and nearly 26,000 Confederate prisoners died in captivity. Just over 12% of the captives in Northern prisons died, compared to 15.5% for Southern prisons.<ref>{{cite book|author=James Ford Rhodes|title=History of the United States from the Compromise of 1850: 1864\u20131866|url=https://archive.org/details/historyunitedst20unkngoog|year=1904|publisher=Harper & Brothers|pages=[https://archive.org/details/historyunitedst20unkngoog/page/n529 507]\u20138}}</ref><ref>Michael B.

[[Holmes County, Ohio]] was an isolated parochial area dominated by [[Pennsylvania Dutch]] and some recent German immigrants. It was a Democratic stronghold and few men dared speak out in favor of conscription. Local politicians denounced Lincoln and Congress as despotic, seeing the draft law as a violation of their local autonomy. In June 1863, small-scale disturbances broke out; they ended when the Army sent in armed units.<ref>Kenneth H.

The South had resisted policies such as tariffs to promote industry and homestead laws to promote farming because slavery would not benefit. With the South gone and Northern Democrats weak, the Republicans enacted their legislation. At the same time they passed new taxes to pay for part of the war and issued large amounts of bonds to pay for most of the rest. Economic historians attribute the remainder of the cost of the war to inflation. Congress wrote an elaborate program of economic [[modernization]] that had the dual purpose of winning the war and permanently transforming the economy.<ref>Heather Cox Richardson, ''The Greatest Nation of the Earth: Republican Economic Policies during the Civil War'' (1997)</ref> For a list of the major industrialists see .\n\n===Financing the war===\n\nIn 1860 the Treasury was a small operation that funded the small-scale operations of the government through land sales and customs based on a low tariff.<ref>Jane Flaherty, \"'The Exhausted Condition of the Treasury' on the Eve of the Civil War,\" ''Civil War History'', (2009) 55#2 pp. 244\u2013277 [http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/civil_war_history/v055/55.2.flaherty.html in Project MUSE]</ref> Peacetime revenues were trivial in comparison with the cost of a full-scale war but the Treasury Department under Secretary [[Salmon P. Chase]] showed unusual ingenuity in financing the war without crippling the economy.<ref>John Niven, ''Salmon P. Chase: a biography'' (1995) p. 331</ref> Many new taxes were imposed and always with a patriotic theme comparing the financial sacrifice to the sacrifices of life and limb. The government paid for supplies in real money, which encouraged people to sell to the government regardless of their politics. By contrast the Confederacy gave paper promissory notes when it seized property, so that even loyal Confederates would hide their horses and mules rather than sell them for dubious paper. Overall the Northern financial system was highly successful in raising money and turning patriotism into profit, while the Confederate system impoverished its patriots.<ref>Jane Flaherty, ''The revenue imperative'' (2009)</ref>\n\nThe United States needed $3.1 billion to pay for the immense armies and fleets raised to fight the Civil War\u2014over $400&nbsp;million just in 1862 alone.<ref>Jerry W. Markham, ''A financial history of the United States'' (2001) vol 3 p{{nbsp}}220</ref>\nApart from tariffs, the largest revenue by far came from [[Excise tax in the United States|new excise taxes]]\u2014a sort of [[value added tax]]\u2014that was imposed on every sort of manufactured item. Second came much higher tariffs, through several [[Morrill tariff]] laws. Third came the nation's first income tax; only the wealthy paid and it was repealed at war's end.\n[[File:Demand Legal comparison.jpg|thumb|upright=1.1|1862 Greenbacks]]\n\nApart from taxes, the second major source of income was government bonds. For the first time bonds in small denominations were sold directly to the people, with publicity and patriotism as key factors, as designed by banker [[Jay Cooke]]. State banks lost their power to issue banknotes. Only national banks could do that and Chase made it easy to become a national bank; it involved buying and holding federal bonds and financiers rushed to open these banks. Chase numbered them, so that the first one in each city was the \"First National Bank\".<ref>Bray Hammond, ''Sovereignty and the Empty Purse: Banks and Politics in the Civil War'' (1970).</ref> Third, the government printed paper money called \"[[United States Note|greenbacks]]\". They led to endless controversy because they caused inflation.<ref>Wesley C.

Even more important, the hundreds of new banks that were allowed to open were required to purchase government bonds. Thereby the nation monetized the potential wealth represented by farms, urban buildings, factories, and businesses, and immediately turned that money over to the Treasury for war needs.<ref>Hammond, ''Sovereignty and the Empty Purse: Banks and Politics in the Civil War'' (1970).</ref>\n\n====Tariffs====\n\nSecretary Chase, though a long-time free-trader, worked with Morrill to pass a second tariff bill in summer 1861, raising rates another 10&nbsp;points in order to generate more revenues.<ref>Richardson, 100, 113</ref> These subsequent bills were primarily revenue driven to meet the war's needs, though they enjoyed the support of protectionists such as Carey, who again assisted Morrill in the bill's drafting. The [[Morrill Tariff]] of 1861 was designed to raise revenue. The tariff act of 1862 served not only to raise revenue but also to encourage the establishment of factories free from British competition by taxing British imports. Furthermore, it protected American factory workers from low paid European workers, and as a major bonus attracted tens of thousands of those Europeans to immigrate to America for high wage factory and craftsman jobs.<ref>{{Cite journal |jstor = 1890520|title = A Political Response to Industrialism: The Republican Embrace of Protectionist Labor Doctrines|journal = The Journal of American History|volume = 70|issue = 1|pages = 35\u201357|last1 = Huston|first1 = James L.|year = 1983|doi = 10.2307/1890520}}</ref>\n\nCustoms revenue from tariffs totaled $345&nbsp;million from 1861 through 1865 or 43% of all federal tax revenue.\n\n===Land grants===\n\nThe U.S. government owned vast amounts of good land (mostly from the Louisiana Purchase of 1803 and the Oregon Treaty with Britain in 1846). The challenge was to make the land useful to people and to provide the economic basis for the wealth that would pay off the war debt. Land grants went to railroad construction companies to open up the western plains and link up to California. Together with the free lands provided farmers by the Homestead Law the low-cost farm lands provided by the land grants sped up the expansion of commercial agriculture in the West.\n\nThe 1862 Homestead Act opened up the public domain lands for free. Land grants to the railroads meant they could sell tracts for family farms (80 to 200 acres) at low prices with extended credit. In addition the government sponsored fresh information, scientific methods and the latest techniques through the newly established [[United States Department of Agriculture|Department of Agriculture]] and the Morrill Land Grant College Act.<ref>Harold M.

The sellers were Southern planters who needed the cash, regardless of their patriotism. The Northern buyers could make heavy profits, which annoyed soldiers like Ulysses Grant. He blamed Jewish traders and [[General Order No. 11 (1862)|expelled them from his lines in 1862]] but Lincoln quickly overruled this show of anti-semitism. Critics said the cotton trade helped the South, prolonged the war and fostered corruption. Lincoln decided to continue the trade for fear that Britain might intervene if its textile manufacturers were denied raw material. Another goal was to foster latent Unionism in Southern border states. Northern textile manufacturers needed cotton to remain in business and to make uniforms, while cotton exports to Europe provided an important source of gold to finance the war.<ref>David S.

In general, the pietistic denominations such as the Methodists, Northern Baptists and Congregationalists strongly supported the war effort. Catholics, Episcopalians, Lutherans and conservative Presbyterians generally avoided any discussion of the war, so it would not bitterly divide their membership. The Quakers, while giving strong support to the abolitionist movement on a personal level, refused to take a denominational position.

Frank reports that what it meant to be a father varied with status and age. He says most men demonstrated dual commitments as providers and nurturers and believed that husband and wife had mutual obligations toward their children. The war privileged masculinity, dramatizing and exaggerating, father-son bonds.

Confederates sometimes styled them \"Homemade Yankees\". However, Southern Unionists were not necessarily northern sympathizers and many of them, although opposing secession, supported the Confederacy once it was a fact. East Tennessee never supported the Confederacy, and Unionists there became powerful state leaders, including governors [[Andrew Johnson]] and [[William G. Brownlow]]. Likewise, large pockets of eastern Kentucky were Unionist and helped keep the state from seceding.<ref>Kent Dollar et al. eds.

Roving insurgent bands such as [[Quantrill's Raiders]] and the men of [[Bloody Bill Anderson]] terrorized the countryside, striking both military installations and civilian settlements. Because of the widespread attacks and the protection offered by Confederate sympathizers, Federal leaders issued [[General Order \u2116 11 (1863)|General Order No. 11]] in 1863, and evacuated areas of Jackson, Cass, and Bates counties. They forced the residents out to reduce support for the guerrillas. Union cavalry could sweep through and track down Confederate guerrillas, who no longer had places to hide and people and infrastructure to support them. On short notice, the army forced almost 20,000 people, mostly women, children and the elderly, to leave their homes. Many never returned and the affected counties were economically devastated for years after the end of the war.<ref>Sarah Bohl, \"A War on Civilians: Order Number 11 and the Evacuation of Western Missouri,\" ''Prologue'', April 2004, Vol. 36 Issue 1, pp 44\u201351</ref> Families passed along stories of their bitter experiences down through several generations\u2014[[Harry Truman]]'s grandparents were caught up in the raids and he would tell of how they were kept in concentration camps.<ref>Michael R.

In 1882, the bank robber and ex-Confederate guerrilla [[Jesse James]] was killed in [[Saint Joseph, Missouri|Saint Joseph]]. Vigilante groups appeared in remote areas where law enforcement was weak, to deal with the lawlessness left over from the guerrilla warfare phase. For example, the [[Bald Knobbers]] were the term for several law-and-order vigilante groups in the Ozarks. In some cases, they too turned to illegal gang activity.<ref>Elmo Ingenthron and Hartman, ''Bald Knobbers: Vigilantes on the Ozarks Frontier'' (1988)</ref>\n\n====Kentucky====\n\n{{main|Kentucky in the Civil War}}\n\nIn response to the growing problem of locally organized guerrilla campaigns throughout 1863 and 1864, in June 1864, Maj. Gen. [[Stephen G. Burbridge]] was given command over the state of Kentucky. This began an extended period of military control that would last through early 1865, beginning with [[martial law]] authorized by President [[Abraham Lincoln]]. To pacify Kentucky, Burbridge rigorously suppressed disloyalty and used economic pressure as coercion.

The RCMP provides law enforcement at the federal level.

Larger cities may form their own municipal police departments.\n\nThe two most populous provinces, [[Ontario]] and [[Quebec]], maintain provincial forces: the [[Ontario Provincial Police]] and {{lang|fr|[[S\u00fbret\u00e9 du Qu\u00e9bec]]}}. The other eight provinces contract policing responsibilities to the RCMP. The RCMP provides front-line policing in those provinces under the direction of the provincial governments. When [[Newfoundland]] joined the confederation in 1949, the RCMP entered the province and absorbed the then [[Newfoundland Ranger Force]], which patrolled most of Newfoundland's rural areas. The [[Royal Newfoundland Constabulary#Operations|Royal Newfoundland Constabulary]] patrols urban areas of the province. In the territories, the RCMP is the sole [[territorial police force]]. Many municipalities throughout Canada contract to the RCMP. Thus, the RCMP polices at the federal, provincial, and municipal level. In several areas of Canada, it is the only police force.\n\nThe RCMP is responsible for an unusually large breadth of duties. Under their federal mandate, the RCMP police throughout Canada, including Ontario and Quebec (albeit under smaller scales there). Federal operations include: enforcing federal laws including commercial crime, counterfeiting, drug trafficking, border integrity, organized crime, and other related matters; providing counter-terrorism and domestic security; providing [[Royal Canadian Mounted Police Protective Policing|protection services]] for the [[Monarchy of Canada|Canadian Monarch]], [[Governor General of Canada|governor general]], [[Prime Minister of Canada|prime minister]], their families and residences, and other [[Minister of the Crown|ministers of the Crown]], visiting dignitaries, and diplomatic missions; and participating in various international policing efforts.\n\nUnder provincial and municipal contracts the RCMP provides front-line policing in all areas outside of Ontario and Quebec that do not have an established local police force. There are detachments located in small villages in the [[Northern Canada|far north]], remote [[First Nations]] [[Indian reserve|reserves]], and rural towns, but also larger cities such as [[Surrey, British Columbia]] (population 468,251). There, support units investigate for their own detachments, and smaller municipal police forces. Investigations include major crimes, homicides, forensic identification, collision forensics, police dogs, emergency response teams, explosives disposal, and undercover operations. Under its National Police Services branch the RCMP supports all police forces in Canada via the [[Canadian Police Information Centre]], [[Criminal Intelligence Service Canada]], Forensic Science and Identification Services, [[Canadian Firearms Program]], and the [[Ontario Police College|Canadian Police College]].\n\nThe [[RCMP Security Service]] was a specialized political intelligence and counterintelligence branch with national security responsibilities, replaced by the [[Canadian Security Intelligence Service]] in 1984, following revelations of illegal [[covert operation]]s relating to the [[Quebec sovereignty movement|Quebec separatist movement]].<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20080425205414/http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.com/index.cfm?PgNm=TCE&Params=A1ARTA0004009 \"Inquiry Into Certain Activities of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police, Royal Commission of,\"] ''Canadian Encyclopedia.''

Macdonald]] first began planning a permanent force to patrol the [[North-West Territories]] after the Dominion of Canada purchased the territory from the [[Hudson's Bay Company]]. Reports from army officers surveying the territory led to the recommendation that a mounted force of between 100 to 150 mounted riflemen could maintain law and order. The Prime Minister first announced the force as the \"North West Mounted Rifles\". However, officials in the United States raised concerns that an armed force along the border was a prelude to a military buildup. Macdonald then renamed the force the [[North-West Mounted Police]] (NWMP) when formed in 1873.<ref>p.52 Sendzikas, Aldona ''Stanley Barracks: Toronto's Military Legacy'' Dundurn Press Ltd., 01/01/2011</ref>\n\nThe force added \"royal\" to its name in 1904. It merged with the Dominion Police, the main police force for all points east of Manitoba, in 1920 and was renamed the \"Royal Canadian Mounted Police\". The new organization was charged with federal law enforcement in all the provinces and territories, and immediately established its modern role as protector of Canadian national security, as well as assuming responsibility for national [[counterintelligence]].\n\nAs part of its national security and intelligence functions, the RCMP infiltrated ethnic or political groups considered to be dangerous to Canada. This included the [[Communist Party of Canada]], but also a variety of minority cultural and nationalist groups. The force was also deeply involved in immigration matters, and especially deportations of suspected radicals. They were especially concerned with [[Ukrainian Canadian|Ukrainian]] groups, both nationalist and socialist.<ref>Hewitt, Steve. \"Policing the Promised Land: The RCMP and Negative Nation-building in Alberta and Saskatchewan in the Interwar Period\", ''The Prairie West as Promised Land'' ed. R. Douglas Francis and Chris Kitzan (Calgary: University of Calgary Press, 2007), 318-320.</ref> The [[Chinese Canadian|Chinese community]] was also targeted because of disproportionate links to [[opium den]]s. Historians estimate fully two percent of the Chinese community was deported between 1923 and 1932, largely under the provisions of the ''Opium and Narcotics Drugs Act'' (ONDA).<ref>Hewitt, 322</ref> Besides the RCMP's new responsibilities in intelligence, drugs enforcement, and immigration, the force also assisted numerous other federal agencies with tasks such as enforcing the [[Canadian Indian residential school system|residential school]] system for [[Aboriginal peoples in Canada|Aboriginal children]].\n[[File:RCMP 1935 postcard.jpg|thumb|upright|Mountie, c.1935]]\nIn 1935, the RCMP, collaborating with the [[Regina Police Service]], crushed the [[On-to-Ottawa Trek]] by sparking the Regina Riot, in which one city police officer and one protester were killed. The Trek, which had been organized to call attention to the abysmal conditions in relief camps, therefore failed to reach Ottawa, but nevertheless had profound political reverberations. The RCMP also lost four officers in Saskatchewan and Alberta that year in what became the [[1935 Royal Canadian Mounted Police Killings]].\n\nThe RCMP employed [[special constable]]s to assist with [[Strike action|strikebreaking]] in the interwar period. For a brief period in the late 1930s, a volunteer militia group, the [[Legion of Frontiersmen]], were affiliated with the RCMP. Many members of the RCMP belonged to this organization, which was prepared to serve as an auxiliary force. In later years, special constables performed duties such as policing airports and, in some Canadian provinces, the courthouses.\n\nIn 1932 saw the men, vehicles and vessels of the Customs Preventive Service, National Revenue, absorbed by the RCMP. This created the Marine Section and the Excise Section.<ref>McIntosh, Dave. ''The Collectors: A History of Canadian Customs and Excise'' (Published by NC Press in association with Revenue Canada, Customs and Excise, 1984)</ref> The acquisition of the RCMP [[schooner]] ''[[St. Roch (ship)|St. Roch]]'' facilitated the first effective patrol of Canada's [[Arctic]] territory. It was the first vessel to navigate the [[Northwest Passage]] from west to east (1940\u201342), the first to navigate the passage in one season (from Halifax to Vancouver in 1944), the first to sail either way through the passage in one season, and the first to circumnavigate North America (1950).<ref>Kelly, Nora and William.

This led to the [[Royal Commission of Inquiry into Certain Activities of the RCMP]], better known as the \"McDonald Commission\", named for the presiding judge, Justice David Cargill McDonald. The commission recommended that the force's intelligences duties be removed in favour of the creation of a separate intelligence agency, the [[Canadian Security Intelligence Service]] (CSIS).\n\n===Modern era===\n[[File:Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) Sunset Ceremony 2012.jpg|thumb|Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) Sunset Ceremony 2012]]\nIn 1993, the [[Special Emergency Response Team]] (SERT), were transferred to the [[Canadian Forces]] (CF), creating a new unit called [[Joint Task Force 2]] (JTF2).

Members wear the review order during the [[Musical Ride]], an equestrian drill in which mounted members show their riding skills and handling of the cavalry lance. On normal duties, the RCMP uses standard police methods, equipment, and uniforms. The RCMP uses horses for ceremonial operations such as escorting the governor general's open [[landau (carriage)|landau]] to the opening of Parliament.\n\n===Tunic===\nThe [[red coat (military uniform)|Red Serge tunic]] that identified the NWMP and later the RNWMP and RCMP, is the standard British military pattern. In the original version, worn from 1873 to 1876, it was based on the civilian [[Norfolk jacket]]<ref>{{cite book|first=David|last=Ross|pages=21\u201322|title=The Royal Canadian Mounted Police 1873-1987|isbn=0-85045-834-X|date=March 24, 1988}}</ref>\n.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">[http://www.rcmp-grc.gc.ca/hist/hnud-nhut/nwmp-pcno-uni-eng.htm North-West Mounted Police Uniform - Royal Canadian Mounted Police].

Retrieved on 2014-04-12.</ref> Originally kitted from [[militia]] stores, the NWMP later adopted a standard style that emphasized the force's British heritage and differentiated it from the blue American military uniforms. In 1904, dark blue shoulder straps and collars replaced the uniform's scarlet facings<ref>{{cite book|first=David|last=Ross|page=36|title=The Royal Canadian Mounted Police 1873\u20131987|isbn=-0-85045-834-X|date=March 24, 1988}}</ref> when King Edward VII granted the Force \"Royal\" status for its service in the [[Second Boer War]]. Today, RCMP personnel under the rank of inspector wear blue \"[[gorget]]\" patches on the collar, while officers from inspector to commissioner wear solid blue collars and blue pointed-sleeve cuffs.\n\nMembers once wore a white [[haversack]] on top of this jacket and white [[Gauntlet (glove)|gauntlets]],<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/> which contrasted with the red tunic. The modern dress uniform replaces these easily dirtied items with brown leather riding gloves and carrying pouches on the belt.\n\n===Hat===\nAlthough the NWMP contingent at [[Queen Victoria]]'s [[Diamond Jubilee]] wore the campaign hat, it only became official in 1904.\n\nA campaign hat is a broad-brimmed [[felt]] or straw hat, with a high crown, pinched symmetrically at the four corners (Montana crown).\n\nThe hat is most commonly worn as part of a uniform by such agencies as the Royal Canadian Mounted Police, the [[New Zealand Army]], [[National Park Service|United States Park Rangers]], and Scouts. The RCMP did not adopt it until about 1904. The original primary summer headdress was the white British foreign service helmet, also known as a [[pith helmet]]. This was an impractical choice for the [[Western Canada|Canadian west]], and RCMP members wore a Stetson type hat on patrol and around camp. [[Sam Steele]] is often credited with introducing the Stetson-type hat, and when he left the force to command [[Lord Strathcona's Horse (Royal Canadians)|Lord Strathcona's Horse]] in South Africa, his unit adopted the Stetson. During winter, members wore a [[Canadian military fur wedge cap]] or [[Busby (military headdress)|busby]]. In British Columbia, the hat features a black bearskin rim belt.\n\n===Breeches===\nThe NWMP wore [[buff (colour)|buff]] or steel grey breeches until they adopted dark blue breeches with yellow-gold strapping (stripes) in 1876.<ref>{{cite book|first=David|last=Ross|page=26|title=The Royal Canadian Mounted Police 1873-1987|isbn=0-85045-834-X|date=March 24, 1988}}</ref> Members often exchanged kit with U.S. cavalry units, and while some believe this was the source for the breeches, the NWMP considered adopting blue breeches with a white strap. Dark blue with yellow-gold strapping is a British cavalry tradition, and most cavalry (later armoured) regiments' dress uniforms feature yellow stripes.\n\n===Boots===\nBlack riding boots changed to the modern brown style called \"Strathcona boots\" or informally as \"high browns\" and the original crossbelts changed to the brown Sam Browne type. The brown colour of the boots and belt the RCMP wear with the Red Serge are from members who applied coats of polish, often during training at Depot Division.\n\n===Spurs===\nThe RCMP's original spurs, known as \"long shank spurs,\" were solid nickel. Their owners occasionally had their regimental number engraved on the inside, and some replaced the [[rowel]] with a US [[buffalo nickel]] {{citation needed|date=May 2016}} to complement the Mounted Police capbadge and avoid using a Canadian coin that would deface the monarch. The RCMP last issued long shank spurs in 1968.\n\nSidearms are standard now, but were often not worn in the early years.{{citation needed|date=August 2017}}\n\n=== Operational uniform ===\n[[File:RCMP in regular uniform.jpg|thumb|right|upright|RCMP in everyday uniform]]\n[[File:RCMP shoulder flash.png|thumb|Closeup of shoulder flash on sleeve of operational uniform]]\nThe operational uniform is a grey shirt, dark blue trousers with gold stripping, regular patrol boots called \"[[ankle boots]]\", regular duty equipment, and a [[peaked cap|regular policeman's style cap]]. Members on operational duty wear a blue [[Gore-Tex]] open-collar jacket ([[patrol jacket]]), while [[Sergeant-major|sergeants major]] and certain [[non-commissioned officer]]s (NCOs) involved in recruit training or media relations wear a dark blue jacket (blue serge). Depending on their duties, officers wear white shirts and the patrol jacket or blue serge. During the summer, officers wear a short-sleeved shirt. Winter dress is a long-sleeved shirt. A tie is worn on occasion for events such as testifying in court. In colder weather, members may wear heavier boots, winter coats ([[storm coat]]s) and a fur cap or toque.\n\nIn 1990, Baltej Singh Dhillon became the RCMP's first [[Sikh]] officer to be allowed to wear a [[turban]] instead of the traditional [[Campaign hat#Royal Canadian Mounted Police|Stetson]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.cbc.ca/archives/entry/1990-sikh-mounties-permitted-to-wear-turbans|title=1990: Sikh Mounties permitted to wear turbans|publisher=CBC Archives|accessdate=3 February 2017}}</ref> On March 15, the federal government, despite protests, decided they would allow Sikhs to wear [[Dastar|their religious headgear]] while on duty as RCMP officers, as had been the practice for Sikh members of [[Canadian Forces]] for decades.\n\nDespite ongoing pressure from groups such as the [[Association for the Protection of Fur-Bearing Animals]],<ref>[http://www.furbearerdefenders.com/index.php/campaigns/rcmp-hats RCMP Hats] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131101045029/http://www.furbearerdefenders.com/index.php/campaigns/rcmp-hats |date=November 1, 2013 }}.

The force raised the Canadian Mounted Rifles, mostly from NWMP members, for service in South Africa. For the CMR's distinguished service there, King Edward VII honoured the NWMP by changing the name to the \"Royal Northwest Mounted Police\" (RNWMP) on June 24, 1904.\n\nDuring the First World War, the Royal Northwest Mounted Police (RNWMP) conducted [[Border#Jurisdictional borders|border]] patrols, [[surveillance]] of enemy [[Alien (law)|alien]]s, and enforcement of [[national security]] regulations within Canada. However, RNWMP officers also served overseas. On August 6, 1914, a [[Squadron (army)|squadron]] of volunteers from the RNWMP was formed to serve with the Canadian Light Horse in France. In 1918, two more squadrons were raised, A Squadron for service in France and [[Flanders]] and B Squadron for service in the [[Canadian Siberian Expeditionary Force]].\n\nIn September 1939, at the outset of the Second World War, the Canadian Army had no military police. Five days after war was declared the Royal Canadian Mounted Police received permission to form a provost company of force volunteers. It was designated \"No. 1 Provost Company (RCMP)\", and became the [[Canadian Provost Corps]]. Six months after war was declared its members were overseas in Europe and served throughout the [[World War II|Second World War]] as [[Canadian Forces Military Police|military police]].\n\n===Honours===\nThe Royal Canadian Mounted Police were accorded the status of a regiment of dragoons in 1921.

Regular members also serve in over 150 different types of operational and administrative opportunities available within the RCMP, these include: major crime investigations, emergency response, forensic identification, [[Vehicular accident reconstruction|forensic collision reconstruction]], international peacekeeping, bike or marine patrol, explosives disposal and police dog services. Also included are administrative roles including human resources, corporate planning, policy analysis and public affairs.\n\n===Auxiliary constables and other staff===\nBesides the regular RCMP officers, several types of designations exist which give them assorted powers and responsibilities over policing issues.\n\nCurrently, there are:\n* Community constables: Varies across Canada {{Citation needed|reason=Awaiting formal report for the RCMP.

However, they are given peace officer powers when on duty with a regular member (RM). Their duties consist mainly of assisting RMs in routine events, for example cordoning off crime scene areas, crowd control, participating in [[Neighborhood watch|community policing]], assistance during situations where regular members might be overwhelmed with their duties (e.g., keeping watch of a backseat detainee while RM interviews a victim). They are identified by the wording of \"RCMP Auxiliary\" on cars, jackets and shoulder flashes\n\n;[[Special Constable#Canada|Special constable]]s (S/Cst.): Employees of the RCMP have varied duties depending on where they are deployed, but are often given this designation because of an expertise they possess which needs to be applied in a certain area. For example, an Aboriginal person might be appointed a special constable in order to assist regular members as they police an Aboriginal community where English is not well understood, and where the special constable speaks the language well. They still perform this role today in many isolated northern communities and the RCMP has 122 special constables who are active in the RCMP today, and they are drawn almost entirely from the same Aboriginal communities that they serve.\n\n:From the early years of policing in northern Canada, and well into the 1950s, local aboriginal people were hired by the RCMP as special constables and were employed as guides and to obtain and care for sled dog teams. Many of these former special constables still reside in the north to this day and are still involved in regimental functions of the RCMP.\n\n;Civilian members of the RCMP: While not delegated the powers of police officers, they are instead hired for their specialized scientific, technological, communications and administrative skills. Since the RCMP is a multi-faceted law enforcement organization with responsibilities for federal, provincial and municipal policing duties, it offers employment opportunities for civilian members as professional partners within Canada's national police force.\n\nCivilian members represent approximately 14% of the total RCMP employee population, and are employed within RCMP establishments in most geographical areas of Canada. The following is a list of the most common categories of employment that may be available to interested and qualified individuals.\n\n*Operations\n** Telecommunications operator ([[dispatcher]])<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rcmp-grc.gc.ca/recruiting-recrutement/cm-mc/teleops-opstele-eng.htm |title=Telecommunications Operators |publisher=rcmp-grc.gc.ca |date=July 30, 2010 |accessdate=September 1, 2010}}</ref>\n* Scientific\n** [[Toxicology]]\n** [[Chemistry]]\n** [[Biology]] \u2013 [[DNA]]\n** [[Law]]\n*Technical\n** Forensic identification services\n** Instrument technology\n** [[questioned document examination|Document examination]]\n** Counterfeit analysis\n** Firearms technology\n** Electronics technology\n** [[Information technology]]\n** [[Communication]]s\n** Computer systems development\n** [[Telecommunication]]s\n** Information services/public affairs\n* [[Administration of business|Administrative]]\n** Policy development and analysis\n** Staff development and training\n** [[Human resource management]]\n** [[Translation]]\n** Police Records Information Management Environment (PRIME-BC)\n\n;Public service employees: Also referred to as public servants, PSes or PSEs, they provide much of the administrative support for the RCMP in the form of detachment clerks and other administrative support at the headquarters level. They are not police officers, do not wear a uniform, have no police authority and are not bound by the ''RCMP Act''.\n\n;Municipal employees:\nAbbreviated as \"ME\" they are found in RCMP detachments where a contract exists with a municipality to provide front-line policing. MEs are not actually employees of the RCMP, but are instead employed by the local municipality to work in the RCMP detachment. They conduct the same duties that a PSE would and are required to meet the same reliability and security clearance to do so. Many detachment buildings house a combination of municipally and provincially funded detachments, and therefore there are often PSEs and MEs found working together in them.\n\n===Ranks===\nThe rank system of the RCMP is partly a result of their origin as a [[paramilitary]] force. Upon its founding, the RCMP adopted the rank insignia of the [[Canadian Army]] (which in turn came from the [[British Army]]), which is almost identical to that of the current Canadian Army. Like in a military, the RCMP also has a distinction between commissioned and non-commissioned officers. The non-commissioned ranks are mostly based on military ranks (apart from constable). Non-commissioned officer ranks above staff sergeant resemble those that formerly existed in the Canadian Army, but have since been replaced by [[warrant officer]]s.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://uniforminsignia.org/?option=com_insigniasearch&Itemid=53&result=552|title=Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP\u00a8) / Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) / Gendarmerie royale du Canada (GRC)|publisher=}}</ref> The commissioned officer ranks, by contrast, use a set of non-military titles that are often used in Commonwealth police services. The number of higher ranks like chief superintendent and deputy commissioner have been added on and increased since the formation of the force, while the lower commissioned rank of sub-inspector has been dropped.\n\nThe numbers are current as of April 1, 2019:<ref>{{cite web|last1=Government of Canada |first1=Royal Canadian Mounted Police|url=http://www.rcmp-grc.gc.ca/about-ausujet/organi-eng.htm|title=Organizational Structure |website=www.rcmp-grc.gc.ca |accessdate=17 May 2019 |date=1 April 2019}}</ref>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n! colspan=\"6\" |Commissioned officers\n|-\n!Commissioner\n!Deputy commissioner\n!Assistant commissioner\n!Chief superintendent\n!Superintendent\n!Inspector\n|-\n!{{lang|fr|Commissaire}}\n!{{lang|fr|Sous-commissaire}}\n!{{lang|fr|Commissaire adjoint}}\n!{{lang|fr|Surintendant principal}}\n!{{lang|fr|Surintendant}}\n!{{lang|fr|Inspecteur}}\n|-\n!Commr.\n!D/Commr.\n!A/Commr.\n!C/Supt.\n!Supt.\n!Insp.\n|-\n!1\n!6\n!33\n!55\n!186\n!331\n|-\n|[[File:RCMP Commissioner.png|center|frameless|150x150px]]\n|[[File:RCMP Deputy Commissioner.png|center|frameless|150x150px]]\n|[[File:RCMP Assistant Commissioner.png|center|frameless|150x150px]]\n|[[File:RCMP Chief Superintendent.png|center|frameless|150x150px]]\n|[[File:RCMP Superintendent.png|center|frameless|150x150px]]\n|[[File:RCMP Inspector.png|center|frameless|150x150px]]\n|}\n<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.rcmp-grc.gc.ca/en/regular-member-annual-rates-pay|title=Regular Member - Annual Rates of Pay {{!}} Royal Canadian Mounted Police|last=Government of Canada|first=Royal Canadian Mounted Police|date=2012-09-14|website=www.rcmp-grc.gc.ca|access-date=2019-07-17}}</ref> these are the official abbreviations for the Commissioned Officers and also the Non-Commissioned officers in the RCMP.

Depending on the dress, badges are worn on the shoulder as slip-ons, on shoulder boards, or directly on the [[epaulette]]s. The lower ranks are non-commissioned officers and the insignia continues to be based on pre-1968 Canadian Army patterns. Since 1990, the non-commissioned officers' rank insignia has been embroidered on the epaulette slip-ons. Non-commissioned rank badges are worn on the right sleeve of the scarlet/blue tunic and blue jacket. The constables wear no rank insignia. There are also 122 special constables, as well as a varying number of reserve constables, auxiliary constables, and students who wear identifying insignia.\n\nThe [[Bath star|star]], or \"pip\", used in the insignia of commissioned officers represents the military Knight Grand Cross of the [[Order of the Bath]]. The Order's motto ({{lang|la|tria juncta in uno}}, \"three joined in one\", referring to the [[holy trinity]]) is inscribed in a band in the middle of it. The three crowns inset in the centre not only represent the Christian Trinity, but also the three former kingdoms that became the United Kingdom. The RCMP formerly had subaltern ([[junior officer]]) ranks that were indicated by one \"pip\" for a sub-inspector (equivalent to an army second lieutenant) to three \"pips\" for an inspector (equivalent to an army captain).<ref>p.38 Ross, David & May Robin ''The Royal Canadian Mounted Police (1873-1987)'' 1988 Osprey Publishing.</ref> A reorganization in 1960 changed the insignia to three \"pips\" for sub-inspectors<ref>pp.38-39 Ross, David & May, Robin ''The Royal Canadian Mounted Police (1873-1987)'' 1988 Osprey Publishing.</ref> and a crown for inspectors,<ref>pp.38-39 Ross, David & May, Robin ''The Royal Canadian Mounted Police (1873-1987)'' 1988 Osprey Publishing</ref> making the latter a [[field officer]] rank. The rank of sub-inspector was abolished in 1990, leaving the RCMP with no subaltern ranks.\n\nA royal crown is used in the regimental cap badge and the insignia of senior commissioned officers. In 1955 [[St. Edward's Crown]] replaced the [[Tudor Crown]]. Although Queen Elizabeth II had adopted the redesign of the heraldic crown in 1953, it took some time to design, approve, and manufacture the new insignia.\n\nThe crossed [[Mameluke]] [[Kilij|sabre]] and [[Baton (military)|baton]] is the insignia for [[general officer]]s. In the RCMP it designates the commissioner (equivalent to an Army general) and their subordinate deputy commissioners (equivalent to Army lieutenant-generals). The assistant commissioners use the crown-over-three-pips insignia of an Army [[Brigadier#British tradition|brigadier]].\n\nThe brass shoulder title pin on the epaulettes was changed from \"RCMP\" to \"GRC-RCMP\" in 1968. ({{lang|fr|GRC}} stands for {{lang|fr|Gendarmerie royale du Canada}}, the RCMP's French-language title). This was due to a 1968 ruling stating that all statutes had to be published bilingually in both English and French. As a law enforcement agency, the RCMP had to use ranks and titles in both languages. This was later reinforced by the [[Official Languages Act (Canada)|Official Languages Act of 1969]].\n\n==Equipment and vehicles==\n[[File:G20 Toronto - RCMP Truck.jpg|thumb|RCMP truck at the G20 summit in Toronto]]\n\n===Land fleet===\nThe RCMP Land Transport Fleet inventory includes:<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.rcmp-grc.gc.ca/land-terre/index-eng.htm |title=Land Transport |publisher=Rcmp-grc.gc.ca |date=November 14, 2006 |accessdate=May 22, 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100620013431/http://www.rcmp-grc.gc.ca/land-terre/index-eng.htm |archivedate=June 20, 2010 |df=mdy-all }}</ref>\n* [[Police car|Cars]]: 5,330\n* Unmarked vehicles: 2,811\n* Light [[Police truck|trucks]]: 2,090\n* Heavy trucks: 123 \n* SUVs: 616 \n* [[Police motorcycle|Motorcycles]]: 34\n* Small snowmobiles: 481\n* All-terrain vehicles: 181\n* Gas railway cars: 1\n* Tractors: 27\n* [[Police bus|Buses]]: 3\n* Total: 11,697\n\n===Marine craft===\n[[File:Toronto police boats on lake.JPG|thumb|RCMP-CCG vessel ''Simmonds'' with CCGS ''Cape Hurd'']]\nThe RCMP polices [[Canadian Internal Waters]], including the [[Territorial waters|territorial sea]] and contiguous zone as well as the [[Great Lakes]] and [[Saint Lawrence Seaway]]; such operations are provided by the RCMP's Federal Services Directorate and includes enforcing Canada's environment, fisheries, customs and immigration laws.

The Ross Mk I was issued from 1905 to 1907 and the improved Ross Mk II was in testing from 1909 to 1912.<ref name=\"calibremag.ca\"/> The Mk I design was accepted by the Canadian Militia in 1903. The NWMP looked at acquiring the Ross to replace the Winchester and Lee-Metford and ordered 1000. Production problems led to delays until 1904; the most glaring being that the finished product did not match their original specifications.<ref name=\"calibremag.ca\"/> The NWMP demanded their contract carbines use a different set of iron sight (which later became standard on the Mk II) which delayed production for a further year.<ref name=\"calibremag.ca\"/> The carbines received in 1905 were plagued with quality control problems that made them more fragile than the weapons they were to replace.

Its small size made it a handy backup pistol. Most were originally procured to arm NWMP constables assigned to protecting mail cars on trains. The constables would sometimes \"absent-mindedly forget\" to hand the pistols back afterwards.\n\n;'''Sidearms'''\n* 1821 pattern Light Cavalry Sabre - Originally part of a trove of old swords given by the Canadian Militia to the NWMP as weapons.

None of these swords were ever used ceremonially, and were strictly collectibles.  Wilkinson Sword also made a commemorative centennial [[tomahawk (axe)|tomahawk]] and miniature \"letter opener\" models of their centennial swords.\n\nIn 1973, [[Winchester Repeating Arms Company]] produced an RCMP commemorative centennial version of their [[Winchester Model 1894|Model 94]] rifle in [[.30-30 Winchester]], with a {{convert|22|in|mm|abbr=on}} round barrel. The [[Receiver (firearms)|receiver]], buttplate, and [[Forend (firearms)|forend]] cap (on the musket-style forend) were plated in gold. Commemorative medallions were embedded in the right-hand side of the [[Stock (firearms)|stock]], with an \"MP\" engraving. There was engraving on the barrel and receiver indicating the rifle was a centennial commemorative edition. Sights were open notch rear, with a flip-up rear ladder, graduated to {{convert|2000|yd|m|abbr=on}}. Two versions were produced, 9500 with serial numbers beginning \"RCMP\" for commercial sale, 5000 with the prefix \"MP\" sold only to serving RCMP members. In addition, ten presentation models were produced, serialled RCMP1P to RCMP10P.

Coupled with the adage that the Mountie \"always gets his man,\" the image projects them as fearsome, incorruptible, dogged yet gentle champions of the law.

Mounties fiction became a popular genre in both [[pulp magazine]]s and book form. Among the best-selling authors who specialized in tales of the Mounted Police were [[James Oliver Curwood]], [[Laurie York Erskine]], James B Hendryx, T Lund, Harwood Steele (the son of Sam Steele), and William Byron Mowery.\n\nIn other media, a famous example is the [[Radio drama|radio]] and [[Television program|television series]], ''[[Challenge of the Yukon|Sergeant Preston of the Yukon]].'' [[Dudley Do-Right]] (of ''[[The Rocky and Bullwinkle Show]]'') is a 1960s example of the comic aspect of the Mountie myth, as is [[Klondike Kat]], from [[Total Television]]. The [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] musical and Hollywood movie ''[[Rose Marie (1936 film)|Rose-Marie]]'' is a 1930s example of its romantic side. A successful combination were a series of ''[[Renfrew of the Royal Mounted]]'' boy's adventure novels written by Laurie York Erskine beginning in 1922 running to 1941. In the 1930s Erskine narrated a ''Sgt Renfrew of the Mounties'' radio show and a series of films with actor-singer James Newill playing Renfrew were released between 1937 and 1940. In 1953 portions of the films were mixed with new sequences of Newill for a ''Renfrew of the Mounted'' television series.\n\nBruce Carruthers  (b.1901\u2013d.1953), a former Mounted Police corporal (1919\u20131923), served as an unofficial [[technical advisor]] to Hollywood in many films with RCMP characters.<ref>Barr, William ''Red Serge and Polar Bear Pants\" The Biography of Harry Stallworthy, RCMP'' University of Alberta Press 2004</ref> They included ''Heart of the North'' (1938), ''Susannah of the Mounties'' (1939), ''Northern Pursuit'' (1943), ''Gene Autry and The Mounties'' (1951), ''The Wild North'' (1952), and ''The Pony Soldier'' (1952).\n\n===Modern culture===\nIn 1959, the [[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation]] aired [[R.C.M.P. (TV series)|''R.C.M.P.'']], a half-hour dramatic series about an RCMP detachment keeping the peace and fighting crime. Filmed in black and white, in and around Ottawa by [[F. R. Crawley|Crawley Films]], the series was co-produced with the [[BBC]] and the [[Australian Broadcasting Corporation]] and ran for 39 episodes. It was noted for its pairing of Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois and Anglo officers.\n\nCanadians also poke fun at the RCMP with [[Dave Broadfoot|Sergeant Renfrew]] and his faithful dog Cuddles in various sketches produced by the ''[[Royal Canadian Air Farce]]'' comedy troupe. On ''[[That '70s Show]]'' Mounties were played by [[Second City Television|SCTV]] alumni [[Joe Flaherty]] and [[Dave Thomas (actor)|Dave Thomas]]. The British have also exploited the myth: the BBC television series ''[[Monty Python's Flying Circus]]'' featured a group of Mounties singing the chorus in ''[[The Lumberjack Song]]'' in the [[lumberjack]] sketch.\n\nThe 1972\u201390 CBC series ''[[The Beachcombers]]'' features a character named Constable John Constable who attempts to enforce the law in the town of [[Gibsons, British Columbia]].\n\nIn comic books, the [[Marvel Comics]] characters of [[Alpha Flight]] are described on several occasions as \"RCMP auxiliaries,\" and two of their members, [[Snowbird (comics)|Snowbird]] and the second [[Major Mapleleaf]] are depicted as serving members of the force. In the latter case, due to trademark issues, Major Mapleleaf is described as a \"Royal Canadian Mountie\" in the opening roll call pages of each issue of ''Alpha Flight'' he appears in.\n\n[[Charles Bronson]] and [[Lee Marvin]] starred in the 1981 movie ''[[Death Hunt]]'' that fictionalized the RCMP pursuit of [[Albert Johnson (criminal)|Albert Johnson]].\n\nIn the early 1990s, Canadian [[Professional wrestling|professional wrestler]] [[Jacques Rougeau]] utilized the [[List of professional wrestling terms#G|gimmick]] of \"The Mountie\" while wrestling for the [[WWE|WWF]]. He typically wore the Red Serge to the ring, and carried a [[Cattle prod|shock stick]] as an illegal weapon. As his character was portrayed as an [[Heel (professional wrestling)|evil]] Mountie, the RCMP ultimately won an injunction preventing Rougeau from wrestling as this character in Canada, though he was not prevented from doing so outside the country. He briefly held the [[WWE Intercontinental Championship|Intercontinental Championship]] in 1992.\n\nThe 1998 [[swan song]] of [[Nick Berry]]'s time on UK drama ''[[Heartbeat (UK TV series)|Heartbeat]]'' features his character, Sergeant Nick Rowan, transferring to Canada and taking the rank of constable in the Mounties. The special telemovie was titled ''Heartbeat: Changing Places.''\n\nThe 1994\u201398 TV series ''[[Due South]]'' pairs Mountie Constable Benton Fraser with streetwise American detective Ray Vecchio cleaning up the streets of Chicago. It mainly derives its entertainment from the [[stereotype|perceived differences]] in attitude and culture between these two countries' police forces. Fraser is depicted as honest and polite to a fault, even refusing to carry a loaded sidearm when \"assisting\" Detective Vecchio, but almost superhuman in his abilities for thwarting crime.\n\nA pair of Mounties staff the RCMP detachment in the fictional town of [[Lynx River]], Northwest Territories, in the CBC series ''[[North of 60]].'' The series, which aired from 1992 to 1998, is about events in the mostly indigenous community, but the Mounties feature prominently in each episode.\n\nAnother TV series from the 1990s, ''[[Bordertown (1989 TV series)|Bordertown]]'' features an NWMP corporal paired with a [[United States Marshals Service|U.S. marshal]] securing law and order on a frontier U.S.\u2013Canada border town. In the ABC TV mini-series ''[[Answered by Fire]],'' at least three mounties are featured. Mounties also appear in the TV series ''[[When Calls the Heart]]'' (Hallmark Channel).\n\nThe 1987 [[Brian De Palma]] film ''[[The Untouchables (film)|The Untouchables]]'' features cooperation between the [[United States Department of the Treasury|Treasury Department]] task force, led by [[Eliot Ness]], and the Mounties against liquor smuggling across the [[Canada\u2013United States border]].\n\nThe 1995 album ''[[C'est Cheese]]'' by Canadian musical comedy group [[The Arrogant Worms]] includes \"The Mountie Song\", which tells the story of a dissatisfied Mountie.\n\nIn his 1999, album ''[[Soiree]]'' Newfoundland musician A. Frank Willis included \"Savage Cop in Savage Cove\" which was based on a true story and went on to become a big hit.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tidespoint.com/music/afrankwillis.shtml|title=Newfoundland music books food videos images arts crafts|access-date=October 25, 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120918111453/http://www.tidespoint.com/music/afrankwillis.shtml|archive-date=September 18, 2012|url-status=dead|df=mdy-all}}</ref>\n\nFrom 2011, the [[CTV Television Network|CTV]] fantasy drama series ''[[The Listener (TV series)|The Listener]]'' regularly features characters who work for the Integrated Investigative Bureau, a fictional division of the RCMP that brings together various specialists, officers and civilian consultants to work on high-profile or federal cases. Although characters in the employ of the IIB are rarely, if ever, depicted wearing uniform, they are often addressed by their ranks \u2013 two main characters are Sergeant Michelle McClusky and Corporal Dev Clark.\n\n===Mountie merchandise and trademark===\nThere are products and merchandise that are made in the image of the RCMP, like Mounties statues or hats. Before 1995, the RCMP had little control over these products.\n\nThe Royal Canadian Mounted Police received an international licence on April 1, 1995, requiring those who use the RCMP to pay a licensing fee. Proceeds from the fees are used for community awareness programmes.<ref>{{cite news|last=Farnsworth |first=Clyde H. |url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=990CEEDE133CF937A35751C0A963958260&sec=&spon=&pagewanted=all |title=For the Mounties, Justice Is Now a Licensing Fee\u2014New York Times |newspaper=New York Times |date=February 4, 1995 |accessdate=May 22, 2010}}</ref> Those that do not pay the licensing fee are legally unable to use the name of the RCMP or their correct uniforms, though a film such as ''[[Canadian Bacon]]'' used the name \"Royal Mounted Canadian Police\" and the character in the ''[[Dudley Do-Right (film)|Dudley Do-Right]]'' film did not wear accurate insignia.\n\nThrough a Master Licensing Agreement (MLA) with the RCMP, the [[Royal Canadian Mounted Police Foundation|RCMP Foundation]] is responsible for managing the commercial use of the RCMP name, image, and protected marks.<ref>Royal Canadian Mounted Police, \"[https://web.archive.org/web/20071023111746/http://www.bookrags.com/wiki/Royal_Canadian_Mounted_Police]\", Retrieved July 28, 2011</ref> The foundation issues selected companies a royalty-based agreement allowing them to produce and market high-quality official RCMP merchandise.

In 2007, through a decree signed by Commissioner Beverley Busson, the operating name was changed to the \"Royal Canadian Mounted Police Foundation\".\n\nThe [[RCMP Heritage Centre]] is a multi-million dollar museum designed by [[Arthur Erickson]] that opened May 2007 in Regina, Saskatchewan, at the RCMP Academy, Depot Division. It replaced the old RCMP museum and is designed to celebrate the role of the force in Canada's history.\n\n===RCMP Bands===\n[[File:Cornemuse 2.jpg|thumb|Although the official band of the RCMP has disbanded, several small RCMP pipe bands such as this one still remain.]]\n[[File:Canada. Mounties Band, Yukon, 1901.jpg|thumb|A Mounties Band in [[Yukon]], 1901.]]\nThe Royal Canadian Mounted Police Band ({{Lang-fr|La Musique de la Gendarmerie royale du Canada}}) was considered one of the best professional bands assembled in Canada. Although it was an official regimental band, the members worked in the band as a secondary job. It is generally considered to have begun in 1938, though there were various police bands in the RCMP that flourished at the time, leading the [[Canadian government]] granting approval for the creation of a full-time central band in December 1958, with its headquarters in the capital of [[Ottawa]].<ref>{{cite web |last1=Luscombe |first1=Stephen |title=Royal Canadian Mounted Police |url=https://www.britishempire.co.uk/forces/armyunits/canadiancavalry/rcmpbands.htm |website=www.britishempire.co.uk}}</ref><ref name=\"Altissimo\">{{cite web |title=The Royal Canadian Mounted Police Band |url=https://militarymusic.com/blogs/military-music/13516489-the-royal-canadian-mounted-police-band |website=Altissimo! |language=en}}</ref> Appearances made by the band included [[Expo 86]] and the [[Commonwealth Heads of Government Meetings|Commonwealth Conference]] in [[Vancouver]], the [[Calgary Winter Olympics]] in 1988, as well as the visits of [[Soviet President]] [[Mikhail Gorbachev]] and Queen [[Elizabeth II]] in 1990.<ref name=Altissimo/><ref>{{cite web |title=History |url=https://rcmpband.ca/history/ |website=RCMP Band |language=en |date=26 April 2014}}</ref> It was dissolved in 1994 due to government budget cuts.\n\nIn its 55 year existence, it operated as a voluntary regimental band, with its members working with it as a secondary job apart from their other duties in the RCMP. Members of the band wore the RCMP's notable [[Red Serge]] as part of their [[full dress uniform]] and adopted drill seen in [[Canadian military bands]] and bands in the [[British Army]].

Upon approval from commissioner Phillip Murray, the tartan was registered with the [[Scottish Tartans Society]] and presented to the agency by [[Anne, Princess Royal|Anne the Princess Royal]] during her [[Royal tours of Canada by the Canadian Royal Family|royal visit to Canada]] in 1998. The tartan appeared for the first time by a RCMP pipe band at the [[Royal Nova Scotia International Tattoo]] in July and August of 1998.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.rcmp-grc.gc.ca/en/tartan |title=Tartan |publisher=Royal Canadian Mounted Police |accessdate=December 7, 2019}}</ref>\n\n==Controversies and criticism==\n{{Further|List of controversies involving the Royal Canadian Mounted Police}}\nAmerican historian Andrew Graybill has argued that the Mounted Police historically resembled the [[Texas Ranger Division|Texas Rangers]] in many ways.  He argues that each protected the established order by confining and removing Indians, by tightly controlling the mixed blood peoples (the African Americans in Texas and the M\u00e9tis in Canada), assisted the large-scale ranchers against the small-scale ranchers and farmers who fenced the land, and broke the power of labour unions that tried to organize the workers of industrial corporations.<ref>Andrew R.

The RCMP provides law enforcement at the federal level.

The RCMP does not provide active provincial or municipal policing in [[Ontario]] or [[Quebec]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rcmp-grc.gc.ca/about-ausujet/index-eng.htm |title=About the RCMP |publisher=Royal Canadian Mounted Police |date=April 26, 2016 |accessdate=May 7, 2016}}</ref> However, all members of the RCMP have jurisdiction as a [[peace officer]] in [[Provinces and territories of Canada|all]] parts of [[Canada]], including [[Ontario]] and [[Quebec]].<ref>{{Cite book|title=Royal Canadian Mounted Police Act|publisher=RCMP|year=1985|isbn=|location=|pages=s. 11.1}}</ref> Despite the name, the Royal Canadian Mounted Police is no longer an actual [[mounted police]] force, with horses only being used at ceremonial events.\n\nAs Canada's national police force, the RCMP is primarily responsible for enforcing federal laws throughout Canada while general law and order including the enforcement of the [[Criminal Code (Canada)|criminal code]] and applicable provincial legislation is constitutionally the responsibility of the [[Provinces and territories of Canada|provinces and territories]]. Larger cities may form their own municipal police departments.\n\nThe two most populous provinces, [[Ontario]] and [[Quebec]], maintain provincial forces: the [[Ontario Provincial Police]] and {{lang|fr|[[S\u00fbret\u00e9 du Qu\u00e9bec]]}}. The other eight provinces contract policing responsibilities to the RCMP. The RCMP provides front-line policing in those provinces under the direction of the provincial governments. When [[Newfoundland]] joined the confederation in 1949, the RCMP entered the province and absorbed the then [[Newfoundland Ranger Force]], which patrolled most of Newfoundland's rural areas. The [[Royal Newfoundland Constabulary#Operations|Royal Newfoundland Constabulary]] patrols urban areas of the province. In the territories, the RCMP is the sole [[territorial police force]]. Many municipalities throughout Canada contract to the RCMP. Thus, the RCMP polices at the federal, provincial, and municipal level. In several areas of Canada, it is the only police force.\n\nThe RCMP is responsible for an unusually large breadth of duties. Under their federal mandate, the RCMP police throughout Canada, including Ontario and Quebec (albeit under smaller scales there). Federal operations include: enforcing federal laws including commercial crime, counterfeiting, drug trafficking, border integrity, organized crime, and other related matters; providing counter-terrorism and domestic security; providing [[Royal Canadian Mounted Police Protective Policing|protection services]] for the [[Monarchy of Canada|Canadian Monarch]], [[Governor General of Canada|governor general]], [[Prime Minister of Canada|prime minister]], their families and residences, and other [[Minister of the Crown|ministers of the Crown]], visiting dignitaries, and diplomatic missions; and participating in various international policing efforts.\n\nUnder provincial and municipal contracts the RCMP provides front-line policing in all areas outside of Ontario and Quebec that do not have an established local police force. There are detachments located in small villages in the [[Northern Canada|far north]], remote [[First Nations]] [[Indian reserve|reserves]], and rural towns, but also larger cities such as [[Surrey, British Columbia]] (population 468,251). There, support units investigate for their own detachments, and smaller municipal police forces. Investigations include major crimes, homicides, forensic identification, collision forensics, police dogs, emergency response teams, explosives disposal, and undercover operations. Under its National Police Services branch the RCMP supports all police forces in Canada via the [[Canadian Police Information Centre]], [[Criminal Intelligence Service Canada]], Forensic Science and Identification Services, [[Canadian Firearms Program]], and the [[Ontario Police College|Canadian Police College]].\n\nThe [[RCMP Security Service]] was a specialized political intelligence and counterintelligence branch with national security responsibilities, replaced by the [[Canadian Security Intelligence Service]] in 1984, following revelations of illegal [[covert operation]]s relating to the [[Quebec sovereignty movement|Quebec separatist movement]].<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20080425205414/http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.com/index.cfm?PgNm=TCE&Params=A1ARTA0004009 \"Inquiry Into Certain Activities of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police, Royal Commission of,\"] ''Canadian Encyclopedia.''

Macdonald]] first began planning a permanent force to patrol the [[North-West Territories]] after the Dominion of Canada purchased the territory from the [[Hudson's Bay Company]]. Reports from army officers surveying the territory led to the recommendation that a mounted force of between 100 to 150 mounted riflemen could maintain law and order. The Prime Minister first announced the force as the \"North West Mounted Rifles\". However, officials in the United States raised concerns that an armed force along the border was a prelude to a military buildup. Macdonald then renamed the force the [[North-West Mounted Police]] (NWMP) when formed in 1873.<ref>p.52 Sendzikas, Aldona ''Stanley Barracks: Toronto's Military Legacy'' Dundurn Press Ltd., 01/01/2011</ref>\n\nThe force added \"royal\" to its name in 1904. It merged with the Dominion Police, the main police force for all points east of Manitoba, in 1920 and was renamed the \"Royal Canadian Mounted Police\". The new organization was charged with federal law enforcement in all the provinces and territories, and immediately established its modern role as protector of Canadian national security, as well as assuming responsibility for national [[counterintelligence]].\n\nAs part of its national security and intelligence functions, the RCMP infiltrated ethnic or political groups considered to be dangerous to Canada. This included the [[Communist Party of Canada]], but also a variety of minority cultural and nationalist groups. The force was also deeply involved in immigration matters, and especially deportations of suspected radicals. They were especially concerned with [[Ukrainian Canadian|Ukrainian]] groups, both nationalist and socialist.<ref>Hewitt, Steve. \"Policing the Promised Land: The RCMP and Negative Nation-building in Alberta and Saskatchewan in the Interwar Period\", ''The Prairie West as Promised Land'' ed.

Historians estimate fully two percent of the Chinese community was deported between 1923 and 1932, largely under the provisions of the ''Opium and Narcotics Drugs Act'' (ONDA).<ref>Hewitt, 322</ref> Besides the RCMP's new responsibilities in intelligence, drugs enforcement, and immigration, the force also assisted numerous other federal agencies with tasks such as enforcing the [[Canadian Indian residential school system|residential school]] system for [[Aboriginal peoples in Canada|Aboriginal children]].\n[[File:RCMP 1935 postcard.jpg|thumb|upright|Mountie, c.1935]]\nIn 1935, the RCMP, collaborating with the [[Regina Police Service]], crushed the [[On-to-Ottawa Trek]] by sparking the Regina Riot, in which one city police officer and one protester were killed. The Trek, which had been organized to call attention to the abysmal conditions in relief camps, therefore failed to reach Ottawa, but nevertheless had profound political reverberations. The RCMP also lost four officers in Saskatchewan and Alberta that year in what became the [[1935 Royal Canadian Mounted Police Killings]].\n\nThe RCMP employed [[special constable]]s to assist with [[Strike action|strikebreaking]] in the interwar period. For a brief period in the late 1930s, a volunteer militia group, the [[Legion of Frontiersmen]], were affiliated with the RCMP. Many members of the RCMP belonged to this organization, which was prepared to serve as an auxiliary force. In later years, special constables performed duties such as policing airports and, in some Canadian provinces, the courthouses.\n\nIn 1932 saw the men, vehicles and vessels of the Customs Preventive Service, National Revenue, absorbed by the RCMP. This created the Marine Section and the Excise Section.<ref>McIntosh, Dave.

This led to the [[Royal Commission of Inquiry into Certain Activities of the RCMP]], better known as the \"McDonald Commission\", named for the presiding judge, Justice David Cargill McDonald.

JTF2 inherited some equipment and SERT's former training base near [[Ottawa]].\n\nIn 2006, the [[United States Coast Guard]]'s Ninth District and the RCMP began a program called \"Shiprider\", in which 12 Mounties from the RCMP detachment at Windsor and 16 US Coast Guard boarding officers from stations in Michigan ride in each other's vessels. The intent is to allow for seamless enforcement of the international border.<ref>PA1 John Masson, \"Territorial Teamwork,\" Coast Guard Magazine 2/2006, pp.&nbsp;26\u201327</ref>\n\nOn December 6, 2006, [[List of Royal Canadian Mounted Police commissioners|RCMP Commissioner]] [[Giuliano Zaccardelli]] resigned after admitting that his earlier testimony about the [[Maher Arar]] terrorist case was inaccurate. The RCMP's actions were scrutinized by the [[Commission of Inquiry into the Actions of Canadian Officials in Relation to Maher Arar]].\n\nTwo officers were found guilty of perjury and sentenced to jail for their actions in the 2007 [[Robert Dzieka\u0144ski Taser incident]] in Vancouver.\n\nIn 2007, the RCMP was named [[Canadian Newsmaker of the Year|Newsmaker of the Year]] by [[The Canadian Press]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://cnews.canoe.ca/CNEWS/MediaNews/2007/12/25/4739958-cp.html|archiveurl=https://archive.today/20071226200125/http://cnews.canoe.ca/CNEWS/MediaNews/2007/12/25/4739958-cp.html|url-status=dead|title=Canoe.ca News December 25, 2007|archivedate=December 26, 2007}}</ref>\n\nOn June 3, 2013, the RCMP renamed its 'A' Division to National Division and tasked it with handling corruption cases \"at home and abroad\".<ref>{{cite magazine|url=http://www2.macleans.ca/2013/06/03/rcmp-national-division-a-renamed-a-division-to-take-on-corruption/|title=RCMP National Division, a renamed A Division, to take on corruption|date=2013-06-03|magazine=[[Maclean's]]|accessdate=2013-10-25}}</ref>\n\nThe RCMP also has an aviation security division, the [[Sky Marshall]]s.<ref>https://web.archive.org/web/20120626092154/http://www.rcmp-grc.gc.ca/gazette/vol70n3/air-eng.htm</ref>\n\n===Notable cases===\n* The American stagecoach robber [[Bill Miner]] was captured by the RCMP in 1906.<ref name=\"famous\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.rcmp-grc.gc.ca/en/famous-cases-events-and-people|title=Famous cases, events and people &#124; Royal Canadian Mounted Police|first=Royal Canadian Mounted Police|last=Government of Canada|date=December 17, 2014|website=www.rcmp-grc.gc.ca}}</ref>\n* Albert Johnson, known as the [[Mad Trapper of Rat River]], was killed in a shoot-out with the RCMP in 1932.<ref name=\"famous\"/>\n* RCMP officers in Saskatchewan arrested the perpetrator of the [[Shell Lake murders]] in 1967.\n* Anarchist militants known as the [[Squamish Five]] were arrested by the RCMP in 1983.\n* The suspected driver of the reconnaissance vehicle involved in the 1996 [[Khobar Towers bombing]] fled to Canada where he was arrested by the RCMP in the winter of 1997 and was extradited to the United States.\n* Four RCMP officers were fatally shot during an operation in Alberta in March 2005: the [[Mayerthorpe tragedy]] was the single worst multiple killing of RCMP officers since the killing of 3 officers in Kamloops British Columbia by a mentally ill assailant.

Members wear the review order during the [[Musical Ride]], an equestrian drill in which mounted members show their riding skills and handling of the cavalry lance. On normal duties, the RCMP uses standard police methods, equipment, and uniforms. The RCMP uses horses for ceremonial operations such as escorting the governor general's open [[landau (carriage)|landau]] to the opening of Parliament.\n\n===Tunic===\nThe [[red coat (military uniform)|Red Serge tunic]] that identified the NWMP and later the RNWMP and RCMP, is the standard British military pattern. In the original version, worn from 1873 to 1876, it was based on the civilian [[Norfolk jacket]]<ref>{{cite book|first=David|last=Ross|pages=21\u201322|title=The Royal Canadian Mounted Police 1873-1987|isbn=0-85045-834-X|date=March 24, 1988}}</ref>\n.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">[http://www.rcmp-grc.gc.ca/hist/hnud-nhut/nwmp-pcno-uni-eng.htm North-West Mounted Police Uniform - Royal Canadian Mounted Police].

Retrieved on 2014-04-12.</ref> Originally kitted from [[militia]] stores, the NWMP later adopted a standard style that emphasized the force's British heritage and differentiated it from the blue American military uniforms. In 1904, dark blue shoulder straps and collars replaced the uniform's scarlet facings<ref>{{cite book|first=David|last=Ross|page=36|title=The Royal Canadian Mounted Police 1873\u20131987|isbn=-0-85045-834-X|date=March 24, 1988}}</ref> when King Edward VII granted the Force \"Royal\" status for its service in the [[Second Boer War]]. Today, RCMP personnel under the rank of inspector wear blue \"[[gorget]]\" patches on the collar, while officers from inspector to commissioner wear solid blue collars and blue pointed-sleeve cuffs.\n\nMembers once wore a white [[haversack]] on top of this jacket and white [[Gauntlet (glove)|gauntlets]],<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/> which contrasted with the red tunic. The modern dress uniform replaces these easily dirtied items with brown leather riding gloves and carrying pouches on the belt.\n\n===Hat===\nAlthough the NWMP contingent at [[Queen Victoria]]'s [[Diamond Jubilee]] wore the campaign hat, it only became official in 1904.\n\nA campaign hat is a broad-brimmed [[felt]] or straw hat, with a high crown, pinched symmetrically at the four corners (Montana crown).\n\nThe hat is most commonly worn as part of a uniform by such agencies as the Royal Canadian Mounted Police, the [[New Zealand Army]], [[National Park Service|United States Park Rangers]], and Scouts. The RCMP did not adopt it until about 1904. The original primary summer headdress was the white British foreign service helmet, also known as a [[pith helmet]]. This was an impractical choice for the [[Western Canada|Canadian west]], and RCMP members wore a Stetson type hat on patrol and around camp. [[Sam Steele]] is often credited with introducing the Stetson-type hat, and when he left the force to command [[Lord Strathcona's Horse (Royal Canadians)|Lord Strathcona's Horse]] in South Africa, his unit adopted the Stetson. During winter, members wore a [[Canadian military fur wedge cap]] or [[Busby (military headdress)|busby]]. In British Columbia, the hat features a black bearskin rim belt.\n\n===Breeches===\nThe NWMP wore [[buff (colour)|buff]] or steel grey breeches until they adopted dark blue breeches with yellow-gold strapping (stripes) in 1876.<ref>{{cite book|first=David|last=Ross|page=26|title=The Royal Canadian Mounted Police 1873-1987|isbn=0-85045-834-X|date=March 24, 1988}}</ref> Members often exchanged kit with U.S. cavalry units, and while some believe this was the source for the breeches, the NWMP considered adopting blue breeches with a white strap. Dark blue with yellow-gold strapping is a British cavalry tradition, and most cavalry (later armoured) regiments' dress uniforms feature yellow stripes.\n\n===Boots===\nBlack riding boots changed to the modern brown style called \"Strathcona boots\" or informally as \"high browns\" and the original crossbelts changed to the brown Sam Browne type. The brown colour of the boots and belt the RCMP wear with the Red Serge are from members who applied coats of polish, often during training at Depot Division.\n\n===Spurs===\nThe RCMP's original spurs, known as \"long shank spurs,\" were solid nickel. Their owners occasionally had their regimental number engraved on the inside, and some replaced the [[rowel]] with a US [[buffalo nickel]] {{citation needed|date=May 2016}} to complement the Mounted Police capbadge and avoid using a Canadian coin that would deface the monarch. The RCMP last issued long shank spurs in 1968.\n\nSidearms are standard now, but were often not worn in the early years.{{citation needed|date=August 2017}}\n\n=== Operational uniform ===\n[[File:RCMP in regular uniform.jpg|thumb|right|upright|RCMP in everyday uniform]]\n[[File:RCMP shoulder flash.png|thumb|Closeup of shoulder flash on sleeve of operational uniform]]\nThe operational uniform is a grey shirt, dark blue trousers with gold stripping, regular patrol boots called \"[[ankle boots]]\", regular duty equipment, and a [[peaked cap|regular policeman's style cap]]. Members on operational duty wear a blue [[Gore-Tex]] open-collar jacket ([[patrol jacket]]), while [[Sergeant-major|sergeants major]] and certain [[non-commissioned officer]]s (NCOs) involved in recruit training or media relations wear a dark blue jacket (blue serge). Depending on their duties, officers wear white shirts and the patrol jacket or blue serge. During the summer, officers wear a short-sleeved shirt. Winter dress is a long-sleeved shirt. A tie is worn on occasion for events such as testifying in court. In colder weather, members may wear heavier boots, winter coats ([[storm coat]]s) and a fur cap or toque.\n\nIn 1990, Baltej Singh Dhillon became the RCMP's first [[Sikh]] officer to be allowed to wear a [[turban]] instead of the traditional [[Campaign hat#Royal Canadian Mounted Police|Stetson]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.cbc.ca/archives/entry/1990-sikh-mounties-permitted-to-wear-turbans|title=1990: Sikh Mounties permitted to wear turbans|publisher=CBC Archives|accessdate=3 February 2017}}</ref> On March 15, the federal government, despite protests, decided they would allow Sikhs to wear [[Dastar|their religious headgear]] while on duty as RCMP officers, as had been the practice for Sikh members of [[Canadian Forces]] for decades.\n\nDespite ongoing pressure from groups such as the [[Association for the Protection of Fur-Bearing Animals]],<ref>[http://www.furbearerdefenders.com/index.php/campaigns/rcmp-hats RCMP Hats] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131101045029/http://www.furbearerdefenders.com/index.php/campaigns/rcmp-hats |date=November 1, 2013 }}.

Now all officers are identically attired, with two exceptions. The ceremonial dress uniform, or \"walking-out order\", for female members has a long, blue skirt and higher-heeled slip-on pumps plus small black clutch purse (however, in 2012 the RCMP began to allow women to wear trousers and boots with all their formal uniforms.<ref>Moore, Dene.

The force raised the Canadian Mounted Rifles, mostly from NWMP members, for service in South Africa. For the CMR's distinguished service there, King Edward VII honoured the NWMP by changing the name to the \"Royal Northwest Mounted Police\" (RNWMP) on June 24, 1904.\n\nDuring the First World War, the Royal Northwest Mounted Police (RNWMP) conducted [[Border#Jurisdictional borders|border]] patrols, [[surveillance]] of enemy [[Alien (law)|alien]]s, and enforcement of [[national security]] regulations within Canada. However, RNWMP officers also served overseas. On August 6, 1914, a [[Squadron (army)|squadron]] of volunteers from the RNWMP was formed to serve with the Canadian Light Horse in France. In 1918, two more squadrons were raised, A Squadron for service in France and [[Flanders]] and B Squadron for service in the [[Canadian Siberian Expeditionary Force]].\n\nIn September 1939, at the outset of the Second World War, the Canadian Army had no military police. Five days after war was declared the Royal Canadian Mounted Police received permission to form a provost company of force volunteers. It was designated \"No. 1 Provost Company (RCMP)\", and became the [[Canadian Provost Corps]]. Six months after war was declared its members were overseas in Europe and served throughout the [[World War II|Second World War]] as [[Canadian Forces Military Police|military police]].\n\n===Honours===\nThe Royal Canadian Mounted Police were accorded the status of a regiment of dragoons in 1921.

They are the police officers of the RCMP and are responsible for investigating crime and have the authority to make arrests. RMs operate in over 750 detachments, including 200 municipalities and more than 600 Aboriginal communities. RMs are normally assigned to general policing duties at an RCMP detachment for a minimum of three years. These duties allow them to experience a broad range of assignments and experiences, such as responding to [[Emergency telephone number|emergency (9-1-1) calls]], foot patrol, bicycle patrol, traffic enforcement, collecting evidence at crime scenes, testifying in court, apprehending criminals and plain clothes duties. Regular members also serve in over 150 different types of operational and administrative opportunities available within the RCMP, these include: major crime investigations, emergency response, forensic identification, [[Vehicular accident reconstruction|forensic collision reconstruction]], international peacekeeping, bike or marine patrol, explosives disposal and police dog services. Also included are administrative roles including human resources, corporate planning, policy analysis and public affairs.\n\n===Auxiliary constables and other staff===\nBesides the regular RCMP officers, several types of designations exist which give them assorted powers and responsibilities over policing issues.\n\nCurrently, there are:\n* Community constables: Varies across Canada {{Citation needed|reason=Awaiting formal report for the RCMP.

However, they are given peace officer powers when on duty with a regular member (RM). Their duties consist mainly of assisting RMs in routine events, for example cordoning off crime scene areas, crowd control, participating in [[Neighborhood watch|community policing]], assistance during situations where regular members might be overwhelmed with their duties (e.g., keeping watch of a backseat detainee while RM interviews a victim). They are identified by the wording of \"RCMP Auxiliary\" on cars, jackets and shoulder flashes\n\n;[[Special Constable#Canada|Special constable]]s (S/Cst.): Employees of the RCMP have varied duties depending on where they are deployed, but are often given this designation because of an expertise they possess which needs to be applied in a certain area. For example, an Aboriginal person might be appointed a special constable in order to assist regular members as they police an Aboriginal community where English is not well understood, and where the special constable speaks the language well. They still perform this role today in many isolated northern communities and the RCMP has 122 special constables who are active in the RCMP today, and they are drawn almost entirely from the same Aboriginal communities that they serve.\n\n:From the early years of policing in northern Canada, and well into the 1950s, local aboriginal people were hired by the RCMP as special constables and were employed as guides and to obtain and care for sled dog teams. Many of these former special constables still reside in the north to this day and are still involved in regimental functions of the RCMP.\n\n;Civilian members of the RCMP: While not delegated the powers of police officers, they are instead hired for their specialized scientific, technological, communications and administrative skills. Since the RCMP is a multi-faceted law enforcement organization with responsibilities for federal, provincial and municipal policing duties, it offers employment opportunities for civilian members as professional partners within Canada's national police force.\n\nCivilian members represent approximately 14% of the total RCMP employee population, and are employed within RCMP establishments in most geographical areas of Canada. The following is a list of the most common categories of employment that may be available to interested and qualified individuals.\n\n*Operations\n** Telecommunications operator ([[dispatcher]])<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rcmp-grc.gc.ca/recruiting-recrutement/cm-mc/teleops-opstele-eng.htm |title=Telecommunications Operators |publisher=rcmp-grc.gc.ca |date=July 30, 2010 |accessdate=September 1, 2010}}</ref>\n* Scientific\n** [[Toxicology]]\n** [[Chemistry]]\n** [[Biology]] \u2013 [[DNA]]\n** [[Law]]\n*Technical\n** Forensic identification services\n** Instrument technology\n** [[questioned document examination|Document examination]]\n** Counterfeit analysis\n** Firearms technology\n** Electronics technology\n** [[Information technology]]\n** [[Communication]]s\n** Computer systems development\n** [[Telecommunication]]s\n** Information services/public affairs\n* [[Administration of business|Administrative]]\n** Policy development and analysis\n** Staff development and training\n** [[Human resource management]]\n** [[Translation]]\n** Police Records Information Management Environment (PRIME-BC)\n\n;Public service employees: Also referred to as public servants, PSes or PSEs, they provide much of the administrative support for the RCMP in the form of detachment clerks and other administrative support at the headquarters level. They are not police officers, do not wear a uniform, have no police authority and are not bound by the ''RCMP Act''.\n\n;Municipal employees:\nAbbreviated as \"ME\" they are found in RCMP detachments where a contract exists with a municipality to provide front-line policing. MEs are not actually employees of the RCMP, but are instead employed by the local municipality to work in the RCMP detachment. They conduct the same duties that a PSE would and are required to meet the same reliability and security clearance to do so. Many detachment buildings house a combination of municipally and provincially funded detachments, and therefore there are often PSEs and MEs found working together in them.\n\n===Ranks===\nThe rank system of the RCMP is partly a result of their origin as a [[paramilitary]] force. Upon its founding, the RCMP adopted the rank insignia of the [[Canadian Army]] (which in turn came from the [[British Army]]), which is almost identical to that of the current Canadian Army. Like in a military, the RCMP also has a distinction between commissioned and non-commissioned officers. The non-commissioned ranks are mostly based on military ranks (apart from constable).

Depending on the dress, badges are worn on the shoulder as slip-ons, on shoulder boards, or directly on the [[epaulette]]s. The lower ranks are non-commissioned officers and the insignia continues to be based on pre-1968 Canadian Army patterns. Since 1990, the non-commissioned officers' rank insignia has been embroidered on the epaulette slip-ons. Non-commissioned rank badges are worn on the right sleeve of the scarlet/blue tunic and blue jacket. The constables wear no rank insignia. There are also 122 special constables, as well as a varying number of reserve constables, auxiliary constables, and students who wear identifying insignia.\n\nThe [[Bath star|star]], or \"pip\", used in the insignia of commissioned officers represents the military Knight Grand Cross of the [[Order of the Bath]]. The Order's motto ({{lang|la|tria juncta in uno}}, \"three joined in one\", referring to the [[holy trinity]]) is inscribed in a band in the middle of it. The three crowns inset in the centre not only represent the Christian Trinity, but also the three former kingdoms that became the United Kingdom. The RCMP formerly had subaltern ([[junior officer]]) ranks that were indicated by one \"pip\" for a sub-inspector (equivalent to an army second lieutenant) to three \"pips\" for an inspector (equivalent to an army captain).<ref>p.38 Ross, David & May Robin ''The Royal Canadian Mounted Police (1873-1987)'' 1988 Osprey Publishing.</ref> A reorganization in 1960 changed the insignia to three \"pips\" for sub-inspectors<ref>pp.38-39 Ross, David & May, Robin ''The Royal Canadian Mounted Police (1873-1987)'' 1988 Osprey Publishing.</ref> and a crown for inspectors,<ref>pp.38-39 Ross, David & May, Robin ''The Royal Canadian Mounted Police (1873-1987)'' 1988 Osprey Publishing</ref> making the latter a [[field officer]] rank. The rank of sub-inspector was abolished in 1990, leaving the RCMP with no subaltern ranks.\n\nA royal crown is used in the regimental cap badge and the insignia of senior commissioned officers. In 1955 [[St. Edward's Crown]] replaced the [[Tudor Crown]]. Although Queen Elizabeth II had adopted the redesign of the heraldic crown in 1953, it took some time to design, approve, and manufacture the new insignia.\n\nThe crossed [[Mameluke]] [[Kilij|sabre]] and [[Baton (military)|baton]] is the insignia for [[general officer]]s. In the RCMP it designates the commissioner (equivalent to an Army general) and their subordinate deputy commissioners (equivalent to Army lieutenant-generals). The assistant commissioners use the crown-over-three-pips insignia of an Army [[Brigadier#British tradition|brigadier]].\n\nThe brass shoulder title pin on the epaulettes was changed from \"RCMP\" to \"GRC-RCMP\" in 1968. ({{lang|fr|GRC}} stands for {{lang|fr|Gendarmerie royale du Canada}}, the RCMP's French-language title). This was due to a 1968 ruling stating that all statutes had to be published bilingually in both English and French. As a law enforcement agency, the RCMP had to use ranks and titles in both languages. This was later reinforced by the [[Official Languages Act (Canada)|Official Languages Act of 1969]].\n\n==Equipment and vehicles==\n[[File:G20 Toronto - RCMP Truck.jpg|thumb|RCMP truck at the G20 summit in Toronto]]\n\n===Land fleet===\nThe RCMP Land Transport Fleet inventory includes:<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.rcmp-grc.gc.ca/land-terre/index-eng.htm |title=Land Transport |publisher=Rcmp-grc.gc.ca |date=November 14, 2006 |accessdate=May 22, 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100620013431/http://www.rcmp-grc.gc.ca/land-terre/index-eng.htm |archivedate=June 20, 2010 |df=mdy-all }}</ref>\n* [[Police car|Cars]]: 5,330\n* Unmarked vehicles: 2,811\n* Light [[Police truck|trucks]]: 2,090\n* Heavy trucks: 123 \n* SUVs: 616 \n* [[Police motorcycle|Motorcycles]]: 34\n* Small snowmobiles: 481\n* All-terrain vehicles: 181\n* Gas railway cars: 1\n* Tractors: 27\n* [[Police bus|Buses]]: 3\n* Total: 11,697\n\n===Marine craft===\n[[File:Toronto police boats on lake.JPG|thumb|RCMP-CCG vessel ''Simmonds'' with CCGS ''Cape Hurd'']]\nThe RCMP polices [[Canadian Internal Waters]], including the [[Territorial waters|territorial sea]] and contiguous zone as well as the [[Great Lakes]] and [[Saint Lawrence Seaway]]; such operations are provided by the RCMP's Federal Services Directorate and includes enforcing Canada's environment, fisheries, customs and immigration laws.

None of these swords were ever used ceremonially, and were strictly collectibles.  Wilkinson Sword also made a commemorative centennial [[tomahawk (axe)|tomahawk]] and miniature \"letter opener\" models of their centennial swords.\n\nIn 1973, [[Winchester Repeating Arms Company]] produced an RCMP commemorative centennial version of their [[Winchester Model 1894|Model 94]] rifle in [[.30-30 Winchester]], with a {{convert|22|in|mm|abbr=on}} round barrel. The [[Receiver (firearms)|receiver]], buttplate, and [[Forend (firearms)|forend]] cap (on the musket-style forend) were plated in gold. Commemorative medallions were embedded in the right-hand side of the [[Stock (firearms)|stock]], with an \"MP\" engraving. There was engraving on the barrel and receiver indicating the rifle was a centennial commemorative edition. Sights were open notch rear, with a flip-up rear ladder, graduated to {{convert|2000|yd|m|abbr=on}}. Two versions were produced, 9500 with serial numbers beginning \"RCMP\" for commercial sale, 5000 with the prefix \"MP\" sold only to serving RCMP members. In addition, ten presentation models were produced, serialled RCMP1P to RCMP10P. (The production of this commemorative is ironic, since the Winchester 94 was never used by the force.)<ref>Petzal and Bourjaily with Fenson.

Coupled with the adage that the Mountie \"always gets his man,\" the image projects them as fearsome, incorruptible, dogged yet gentle champions of the law. The RCMP's motto is actually the French ''Maintiens le droit'', which has been translated into the English \"Defending the Law\" or \"Maintain the right\".<ref name=\"motto\">{{cite web|url=http://www.rcmp-grc.gc.ca/fs-fd/badge-insigne-eng.htm |title=Royal Canadian Mounted Police - Badges and Insignia |publisher=Rcmp-grc.gc.ca |date=February 16, 2005 |accessdate=May 22, 2010}}</ref><ref name=\"motto3\">{{cite web|url=http://www.quebec400.gc.ca/grc-rcmp-eng.cfm |title=Royal Canadian Mounted Police |publisher=Quebec400.gc.ca |date=February 8, 2008 |accessdate=May 22, 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080716032234/http://www.quebec400.gc.ca/grc-rcmp-eng.cfm |archivedate=July 16, 2008 }}</ref><ref name=Motto2019/> The Hollywood motto derives from a comment by a Montana newspaper, the ''Fort Benton Record'': \"They fetch their man every time\".<ref name=\"Fort Benton\">[https://web.archive.org/web/20081201185546/http://www.thestar.com/NASApp/cs/ContentServer?pagename=thestar%2FLayout%2FArticle_Type1&c=Article&cid=1109976610322&call_pageid=968332188492&col=968793972154&DPL=IvsNDS%2F7ChAX Force's legacy endures], ''[[Toronto Star]]'', March 5, 2005</ref> The RCMP Sunset Ceremony ({{Lang-fr|C\u00e9r\u00e9monie du cr\u00e9puscule}}) has taken place every summer since 1989 at the [[Musical Ride]] Centre in [[Ottawa]]<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.newswire.ca/news-releases/the-royal-canadian-mounted-police-presents-the-30th-anniversary-of-the-canadian-sunset-ceremonies-june-27-30-857655750.html |title=The Royal Canadian Mounted Police presents the 30th anniversary of the Canadian Sunset Ceremonies, June 27-30 |date=June 26, 2019 |publisher=CNW Group Ltd. |accessdate=December 6, 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.ottawatourism.ca/ottawa-insider/rcmp-musical-ride-sunset-ceremonies/ |title=RCMP Musical Ride Sunset Ceremonies |publisher=Ottawa Tourism and Convention Authority |accessdate=December 6, 2019}}</ref>, with it in recent years featuring the [[Ottawa Police Service Pipe Band]] and the [[Governor General's Foot Guards Band]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.todocanada.ca/city/ottawa/event/rcmps-canadian-sunset-ceremonies/ |title=RCMP's Canadian Sunset Ceremonies |website=todoCanada.ca|accessdate=December 6, 2019}}</ref><ref>https://rcmphc.com/en/sunset-retreat-ceremonies-2</ref>\n\n===Early depictions===\n\nIn 1912, [[Ralph Connor]]'s ''Corporal Cameron of the North-West Mounted Police: A Tale of the MacLeod Trail'' appeared, becoming an international best-selling novel. Mounties fiction became a popular genre in both [[pulp magazine]]s and book form. Among the best-selling authors who specialized in tales of the Mounted Police were [[James Oliver Curwood]], [[Laurie York Erskine]], James B Hendryx, T Lund, Harwood Steele (the son of Sam Steele), and William Byron Mowery.\n\nIn other media, a famous example is the [[Radio drama|radio]] and [[Television program|television series]], ''[[Challenge of the Yukon|Sergeant Preston of the Yukon]].'' [[Dudley Do-Right]] (of ''[[The Rocky and Bullwinkle Show]]'') is a 1960s example of the comic aspect of the Mountie myth, as is [[Klondike Kat]], from [[Total Television]]. The [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] musical and Hollywood movie ''[[Rose Marie (1936 film)|Rose-Marie]]'' is a 1930s example of its romantic side. A successful combination were a series of ''[[Renfrew of the Royal Mounted]]'' boy's adventure novels written by Laurie York Erskine beginning in 1922 running to 1941. In the 1930s Erskine narrated a ''Sgt Renfrew of the Mounties'' radio show and a series of films with actor-singer James Newill playing Renfrew were released between 1937 and 1940. In 1953 portions of the films were mixed with new sequences of Newill for a ''Renfrew of the Mounted'' television series.\n\nBruce Carruthers  (b.1901\u2013d.1953), a former Mounted Police corporal (1919\u20131923), served as an unofficial [[technical advisor]] to Hollywood in many films with RCMP characters.<ref>Barr, William ''Red Serge and Polar Bear Pants\" The Biography of Harry Stallworthy, RCMP'' University of Alberta Press 2004</ref> They included ''Heart of the North'' (1938), ''Susannah of the Mounties'' (1939), ''Northern Pursuit'' (1943), ''Gene Autry and The Mounties'' (1951), ''The Wild North'' (1952), and ''The Pony Soldier'' (1952).\n\n===Modern culture===\nIn 1959, the [[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation]] aired [[R.C.M.P. (TV series)|''R.C.M.P.'']], a half-hour dramatic series about an RCMP detachment keeping the peace and fighting crime. Filmed in black and white, in and around Ottawa by [[F. R. Crawley|Crawley Films]], the series was co-produced with the [[BBC]] and the [[Australian Broadcasting Corporation]] and ran for 39 episodes. It was noted for its pairing of Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois and Anglo officers.\n\nCanadians also poke fun at the RCMP with [[Dave Broadfoot|Sergeant Renfrew]] and his faithful dog Cuddles in various sketches produced by the ''[[Royal Canadian Air Farce]]'' comedy troupe. On ''[[That '70s Show]]'' Mounties were played by [[Second City Television|SCTV]] alumni [[Joe Flaherty]] and [[Dave Thomas (actor)|Dave Thomas]]. The British have also exploited the myth: the BBC television series ''[[Monty Python's Flying Circus]]'' featured a group of Mounties singing the chorus in ''[[The Lumberjack Song]]'' in the [[lumberjack]] sketch.\n\nThe 1972\u201390 CBC series ''[[The Beachcombers]]'' features a character named Constable John Constable who attempts to enforce the law in the town of [[Gibsons, British Columbia]].\n\nIn comic books, the [[Marvel Comics]] characters of [[Alpha Flight]] are described on several occasions as \"RCMP auxiliaries,\" and two of their members, [[Snowbird (comics)|Snowbird]] and the second [[Major Mapleleaf]] are depicted as serving members of the force. In the latter case, due to trademark issues, Major Mapleleaf is described as a \"Royal Canadian Mountie\" in the opening roll call pages of each issue of ''Alpha Flight'' he appears in.\n\n[[Charles Bronson]] and [[Lee Marvin]] starred in the 1981 movie ''[[Death Hunt]]'' that fictionalized the RCMP pursuit of [[Albert Johnson (criminal)|Albert Johnson]].\n\nIn the early 1990s, Canadian [[Professional wrestling|professional wrestler]] [[Jacques Rougeau]] utilized the [[List of professional wrestling terms#G|gimmick]] of \"The Mountie\" while wrestling for the [[WWE|WWF]]. He typically wore the Red Serge to the ring, and carried a [[Cattle prod|shock stick]] as an illegal weapon. As his character was portrayed as an [[Heel (professional wrestling)|evil]] Mountie, the RCMP ultimately won an injunction preventing Rougeau from wrestling as this character in Canada, though he was not prevented from doing so outside the country. He briefly held the [[WWE Intercontinental Championship|Intercontinental Championship]] in 1992.\n\nThe 1998 [[swan song]] of [[Nick Berry]]'s time on UK drama ''[[Heartbeat (UK TV series)|Heartbeat]]'' features his character, Sergeant Nick Rowan, transferring to Canada and taking the rank of constable in the Mounties. The special telemovie was titled ''Heartbeat: Changing Places.''\n\nThe 1994\u201398 TV series ''[[Due South]]'' pairs Mountie Constable Benton Fraser with streetwise American detective Ray Vecchio cleaning up the streets of Chicago. It mainly derives its entertainment from the [[stereotype|perceived differences]] in attitude and culture between these two countries' police forces. Fraser is depicted as honest and polite to a fault, even refusing to carry a loaded sidearm when \"assisting\" Detective Vecchio, but almost superhuman in his abilities for thwarting crime.\n\nA pair of Mounties staff the RCMP detachment in the fictional town of [[Lynx River]], Northwest Territories, in the CBC series ''[[North of 60]].'' The series, which aired from 1992 to 1998, is about events in the mostly indigenous community, but the Mounties feature prominently in each episode.\n\nAnother TV series from the 1990s, ''[[Bordertown (1989 TV series)|Bordertown]]'' features an NWMP corporal paired with a [[United States Marshals Service|U.S. marshal]] securing law and order on a frontier U.S.\u2013Canada border town. In the ABC TV mini-series ''[[Answered by Fire]],'' at least three mounties are featured. Mounties also appear in the TV series ''[[When Calls the Heart]]'' (Hallmark Channel).\n\nThe 1987 [[Brian De Palma]] film ''[[The Untouchables (film)|The Untouchables]]'' features cooperation between the [[United States Department of the Treasury|Treasury Department]] task force, led by [[Eliot Ness]], and the Mounties against liquor smuggling across the [[Canada\u2013United States border]].\n\nThe 1995 album ''[[C'est Cheese]]'' by Canadian musical comedy group [[The Arrogant Worms]] includes \"The Mountie Song\", which tells the story of a dissatisfied Mountie.\n\nIn his 1999, album ''[[Soiree]]'' Newfoundland musician A. Frank Willis included \"Savage Cop in Savage Cove\" which was based on a true story and went on to become a big hit.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tidespoint.com/music/afrankwillis.shtml|title=Newfoundland music books food videos images arts crafts|access-date=October 25, 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120918111453/http://www.tidespoint.com/music/afrankwillis.shtml|archive-date=September 18, 2012|url-status=dead|df=mdy-all}}</ref>\n\nFrom 2011, the [[CTV Television Network|CTV]] fantasy drama series ''[[The Listener (TV series)|The Listener]]'' regularly features characters who work for the Integrated Investigative Bureau, a fictional division of the RCMP that brings together various specialists, officers and civilian consultants to work on high-profile or federal cases. Although characters in the employ of the IIB are rarely, if ever, depicted wearing uniform, they are often addressed by their ranks \u2013 two main characters are Sergeant Michelle McClusky and Corporal Dev Clark.\n\n===Mountie merchandise and trademark===\nThere are products and merchandise that are made in the image of the RCMP, like Mounties statues or hats. Before 1995, the RCMP had little control over these products.\n\nThe Royal Canadian Mounted Police received an international licence on April 1, 1995, requiring those who use the RCMP to pay a licensing fee. Proceeds from the fees are used for community awareness programmes.<ref>{{cite news|last=Farnsworth |first=Clyde H. |url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=990CEEDE133CF937A35751C0A963958260&sec=&spon=&pagewanted=all |title=For the Mounties, Justice Is Now a Licensing Fee\u2014New York Times |newspaper=New York Times |date=February 4, 1995 |accessdate=May 22, 2010}}</ref> Those that do not pay the licensing fee are legally unable to use the name of the RCMP or their correct uniforms, though a film such as ''[[Canadian Bacon]]'' used the name \"Royal Mounted Canadian Police\" and the character in the ''[[Dudley Do-Right (film)|Dudley Do-Right]]'' film did not wear accurate insignia.\n\nThrough a Master Licensing Agreement (MLA) with the RCMP, the [[Royal Canadian Mounted Police Foundation|RCMP Foundation]] is responsible for managing the commercial use of the RCMP name, image, and protected marks.<ref>Royal Canadian Mounted Police, \"[https://web.archive.org/web/20071023111746/http://www.bookrags.com/wiki/Royal_Canadian_Mounted_Police]\", Retrieved July 28, 2011</ref> The foundation issues selected companies a royalty-based agreement allowing them to produce and market high-quality official RCMP merchandise.

In 2007, through a decree signed by Commissioner Beverley Busson, the operating name was changed to the \"Royal Canadian Mounted Police Foundation\".\n\nThe [[RCMP Heritage Centre]] is a multi-million dollar museum designed by [[Arthur Erickson]] that opened May 2007 in Regina, Saskatchewan, at the RCMP Academy, Depot Division. It replaced the old RCMP museum and is designed to celebrate the role of the force in Canada's history.\n\n===RCMP Bands===\n[[File:Cornemuse 2.jpg|thumb|Although the official band of the RCMP has disbanded, several small RCMP pipe bands such as this one still remain.]]\n[[File:Canada. Mounties Band, Yukon, 1901.jpg|thumb|A Mounties Band in [[Yukon]], 1901.]]\nThe Royal Canadian Mounted Police Band ({{Lang-fr|La Musique de la Gendarmerie royale du Canada}}) was considered one of the best professional bands assembled in Canada. Although it was an official regimental band, the members worked in the band as a secondary job. It is generally considered to have begun in 1938, though there were various police bands in the RCMP that flourished at the time, leading the [[Canadian government]] granting approval for the creation of a full-time central band in December 1958, with its headquarters in the capital of [[Ottawa]].<ref>{{cite web |last1=Luscombe |first1=Stephen |title=Royal Canadian Mounted Police |url=https://www.britishempire.co.uk/forces/armyunits/canadiancavalry/rcmpbands.htm |website=www.britishempire.co.uk}}</ref><ref name=\"Altissimo\">{{cite web |title=The Royal Canadian Mounted Police Band |url=https://militarymusic.com/blogs/military-music/13516489-the-royal-canadian-mounted-police-band |website=Altissimo! |language=en}}</ref> Appearances made by the band included [[Expo 86]] and the [[Commonwealth Heads of Government Meetings|Commonwealth Conference]] in [[Vancouver]], the [[Calgary Winter Olympics]] in 1988, as well as the visits of [[Soviet President]] [[Mikhail Gorbachev]] and Queen [[Elizabeth II]] in 1990.<ref name=Altissimo/><ref>{{cite web |title=History |url=https://rcmpband.ca/history/ |website=RCMP Band |language=en |date=26 April 2014}}</ref> It was dissolved in 1994 due to government budget cuts.\n\nIn its 55 year existence, it operated as a voluntary regimental band, with its members working with it as a secondary job apart from their other duties in the RCMP. Members of the band wore the RCMP's notable [[Red Serge]] as part of their [[full dress uniform]] and adopted drill seen in [[Canadian military bands]] and bands in the [[British Army]]. Its longest serving director was Superintendent Edwin Joseph Lydall who served from 1948 to 1968.<ref>http://canadianobits.com/ontario/webbbs_config.pl/noframes/read/427</ref> \n\nToday, instead of brass and reed bands, the RCMP sports eight regional pipe bands across the major cities of the 10 provinces.

The creation of the tartan was the result of a committee created in the early 1990s to create a tartan by its 125th anniversary. Upon approval from commissioner Phillip Murray, the tartan was registered with the [[Scottish Tartans Society]] and presented to the agency by [[Anne, Princess Royal|Anne the Princess Royal]] during her [[Royal tours of Canada by the Canadian Royal Family|royal visit to Canada]] in 1998. The tartan appeared for the first time by a RCMP pipe band at the [[Royal Nova Scotia International Tattoo]] in July and August of 1998.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.rcmp-grc.gc.ca/en/tartan |title=Tartan |publisher=Royal Canadian Mounted Police |accessdate=December 7, 2019}}</ref>\n\n==Controversies and criticism==\n{{Further|List of controversies involving the Royal Canadian Mounted Police}}\nAmerican historian Andrew Graybill has argued that the Mounted Police historically resembled the [[Texas Ranger Division|Texas Rangers]] in many ways.  He argues that each protected the established order by confining and removing Indians, by tightly controlling the mixed blood peoples (the African Americans in Texas and the M\u00e9tis in Canada), assisted the large-scale ranchers against the small-scale ranchers and farmers who fenced the land, and broke the power of labour unions that tried to organize the workers of industrial corporations.<ref>Andrew R.

The home games were held at [[Stadion am Hutrasen|Hutrasen]] south of river [[Main (river)|Main]], the later venue of local competitor [[VfR 07 Schweinfurt]]. In 1919, Schweinfurt 05 had to move to a new court near Ludwigsbr\u00fccke and became member of the tier-one [[Kreisliga Bayern|Kreisliga Nordbayern]], but relegated after its first season. The team attempted a merger with Turngemeinde Schweinfurt von 1848, which lasted from 1921 to 1923, before the two groups parted ways again and the football division became ''1.

The results in the Bayernliga (IV) were annulled, and the team was relegated to the fifth tier Landesliga.\n\nA re-structured club successfully worked its way back into Bayernliga in 2008.

Fussball-Club Schweinfurt 1905'' was founded on 5 May 1905 by a group of sports enthusiasts. The club's first chairman, Pepi Popp, designed the still unchanged FC 05 crest.<ref name=\"Schweinfurtf\u00fchrer History\"/> \n\nThe new team played in various local leagues until beginning of the [[First World War]]. The home games were held at [[Stadion am Hutrasen|Hutrasen]] south of river [[Main (river)|Main]], the later venue of local competitor [[VfR 07 Schweinfurt]]. In 1919, Schweinfurt 05 had to move to a new court near Ludwigsbr\u00fccke and became member of the tier-one [[Kreisliga Bayern|Kreisliga Nordbayern]], but relegated after its first season. The team attempted a merger with Turngemeinde Schweinfurt von 1848, which lasted from 1921 to 1923, before the two groups parted ways again and the football division became ''1. Fussball-Club Schweinfurt 1905, Verein f\u00fcr Leibes\u00fcbungen e.V.''<ref name=\"History\"/>\n\nWhile FC 05 did not reap the expected benefits from the brief union, it improved dramatically after re-establishing itself as an independent club. Membership grew significantly and a number of new sports departments were formed within the organization. The football team yielded its first fruits in 1927 by winning the Unterfranken Cup championship,<ref name=\"Schweinfurtf\u00fchrer History\">{{cite web|title=Geschichte des FC 05 Schweinfurt | trans-title=FC Schweinfurt 05 History|publisher=www.schweinfurtfuehrer.de | url=https://www.schweinfurtfuehrer.de/geschichte/geschichte-des-fc-05-schweinfurt/ |accessdate=26 July 2017|language=German}}</ref> and in 1931, when it became Kreisliga Unterfranken champion.<ref>{{cite web|title=Kreisliga Bayern 1931|trans-title=1931 Kreisliga Bayern|publisher=fussball-historie.de|url=http://www.fussball-historie.de/Sued/OstkreisII1931.html|accessdate=10 April 2020|language=German}}</ref>\n\n===Years of excellence: 1931\u20131963===\n[[File:Andreas Kupfer and Albin Kitzinger.jpg|thumb|280px|right|[[Andreas Kupfer]] (left) and [[Albin Kitzinger]]]]\n\nSchweinfurt 05 finally gained first class status again with its entry into the [[Bezirksliga Bayern]] in 1931. \nAfter introduction of the [[Gauliga]] system in 1933, the club became member of the top-flight [[Gauliga Bayern]] thanks to finishing 3rd in Bezirksliga Bayern. \nSchweinfurt experienced an era of successful seasons in those years, winning the Gauliga Bayern in [[1938\u201339 Gauliga Bayern|1939]] and [[1941\u201342 Gauliga Bayern|1942]], and qualifying for the [[List of German football champions|German football championship]] round.\n \nIn the German football championship [[1939 German football championship|1939]] competition, the team barely missed the semi-final qualification games after 3 wins in the group stage, where it defeated later [[1943 German football championship|1943]] and [[1944 German football championship|1944]] German champion [[Dresdner SC]] 1\u20130 in the first leg, but then lost to Dresden 0\u20131 in the deceisive away match.<ref name=\"Stumpf\">{{cite web|title=Ehemaliger 05-Torwart Hans Stumpf gestorben|trans-title=Former 05 goalkeeper Hans Stumpf passed|publisher=mainpost.de|url=https://www.mainpost.de/sport/schweinfurt/Ehemaliger-05-Torwart-Hans-Stumpf-gestorben;art795,5487291?wt_ref=https%3A%2F%2Fde.wikipedia.org%2F&wt_t=1585256396531|accessdate=26 March 2020|language=German}}</ref>\nThe club failed in the round of 16 of the [[1942 German football championship|1942]] German football championship after a 1\u20132 loss to [[SG SS Stra\u00dfburg]].\n\nSchweinfurt made a semi-final appearance in the [[1936 Tschammerpokal]], when it was defeated 2\u20133 by [[FC Schalke 04]], the closest it ever came to winning a national title.

FC 05 goalkeeper [[G\u00fcnter Bernard]] made two West Germany appearances in 1962, before he joined Bundesliga founding member [[SV Werder Bremen]] one year later, and was named in Germany's squad for the [[1966 FIFA World Cup]].\n\n===Second tier years: 1963\u20131976===\nAs it did not qualify for the newly established Bundesliga in 1963, Schweinfurt 05 found itself playing in the second tier [[Regionalliga S\u00fcd (1963\u20131974)|Regionalliga S\u00fcd]]. In the [[1965\u201366 Regionalliga|1965\u201366]] season, the club became Southern German champion and made it to the [[1965\u201366 Regionalliga#Bundesliga promotion round|Bundesliga advancement games]], but was unable to ascend to the top tier.\n\nWith the introduction of the [[2. Bundesliga]] in 1974, Schweinfurt was founding member of the [[2. Bundesliga S\u00fcd (1974\u201381)|southern division]] despite only finishing 15th in the last Regionalliga year. For its first 2.

The pageant was founded as Miss Albania in 2002, until rebranding as Miss Universe Albania in 2006. Since 2006, winners of the competition have competed internationally in [[Miss Universe]], while some runners-up have competed in [[Miss World]].\n\n==History==\n[[File:Lola2.jpeg|thumb|230px|[[Floriana Garo]] represented Albania in the Miss World 2012 beauty pageant.]]\nAlbania debuted at Miss Universe in 2002 with the Miss Albania organization as the official franchise holder. The organization held national pageant yearly up into 2006. Beginning in 2007, the franchise license was given to the then official photographer of Miss Universe, Fadil Berisha who happened to be from Albania. At this point Fadil created the \"Miss Universe Albania\" organization and would held occasional yearly national pageant or in some cases, designate a participant to represent Albania at Miss Universe. Fadil would continue to be the national director until 2013.\n\nIn 2014 Eduart Deda acquired the Miss Universe franchise license in Albania and consequently also the [[Miss World]] franchise license. The company would held yearly national pageants where two winners were crowned to compete at Miss Universe and Miss World. The company would held the license of Miss World until 2017.\n\nIn 2018, the Miss World license was given to Vera Grabocka who was previously the national director of Miss World in Albania between 2006-2013,  while Eduart Deda only held the Miss Universe license.\n\n==Implementation and complaints==\nThe beauty contests are carried out by two different organizers: Vera Grabocka has been competing in the Miss Albania competition since 1991, and Petri Bozo and his Deliart Club have held the Miss Shqiperia elections important. Politically, Petri Bozo is associated with the Socialist Party, Vera Grabocka with the Democratic Party. The finalists take part in the election for Miss Europe, since 2002 also for Miss World and Miss Universe.\n\n[[Albanians]] from [[Kosovo]] can also be eliminated at the Miss Albania competition: Venera Mustafa became Miss Kosovo and Miss Albania in 1999.

The pageant was founded as Miss Albania in 2002, until rebranding as Miss Universe Albania in 2006. Since 2006, winners of the competition have competed internationally in [[Miss Universe]], while some runners-up have competed in [[Miss World]].\n\n==History==\n[[File:Lola2.jpeg|thumb|230px|[[Floriana Garo]] represented Albania in the Miss World 2012 beauty pageant.]]\nAlbania debuted at Miss Universe in 2002 with the Miss Albania organization as the official franchise holder. The organization held national pageant yearly up into 2006. Beginning in 2007, the franchise license was given to the then official photographer of Miss Universe, Fadil Berisha who happened to be from Albania. At this point Fadil created the \"Miss Universe Albania\" organization and would held occasional yearly national pageant or in some cases, designate a participant to represent Albania at Miss Universe. Fadil would continue to be the national director until 2013.\n\nIn 2014 Eduart Deda acquired the Miss Universe franchise license in Albania and consequently also the [[Miss World]] franchise license. The company would held yearly national pageants where two winners were crowned to compete at Miss Universe and Miss World. The company would held the license of Miss World until 2017.\n\nIn 2018, the Miss World license was given to Vera Grabocka who was previously the national director of Miss World in Albania between 2006-2013,  while Eduart Deda only held the Miss Universe license.\n\n==Implementation and complaints==\nThe beauty contests are carried out by two different organizers: Vera Grabocka has been competing in the Miss Albania competition since 1991, and Petri Bozo and his Deliart Club have held the Miss Shqiperia elections important. Politically, Petri Bozo is associated with the Socialist Party, Vera Grabocka with the Democratic Party. The finalists take part in the election for Miss Europe, since 2002 also for Miss World and Miss Universe.\n\n[[Albanians]] from [[Kosovo]] can also be eliminated at the Miss Albania competition: Venera Mustafa became Miss Kosovo and Miss Albania in 1999. In the same year she participated for Albania and the Miss Europe election. [[Agnesa Vuthaj]] was a member of the Miss Kosovo in 2003, a member of the Miss Albania in 2004 and a candidate as a member of the Miss World in 2004 and the Miss Universe in 2005.\n\nMiss Universe Albania was launched in 2002 to become a participant in the Miss Universe international competition.\n\nEnkeleid Omi and his agency Alba-Media have been leading the competition for Miss Earth Albania, its winners and Miss Earth since 2005.

They prefer warm temperature conditions and can be more easily found from May to October in lower altitudes, and June to September in higher altitudes where the temperature is typically cooler.<ref name= ref1 /> In higher altitudes, female flies have shorter lifespans, are smaller, and lay fewer clutches of eggs.<ref name= ref1 /> They require fresh dung, primarily from cows and sheep, for reproduction.<ref name=ref15 /> They also eat [[nectarivory|nectar]] which is a source of sugar.<ref name=ref15 />\n\n===Altitude effects===\n''Sepsis cynipsea'' dung flies are often found in regions with varying altitudes, such as the [[Swiss Alps]].<ref name=ref10 /> Out of the many different [[Sepsidae]] species that are found in these regions, ''Sepsis cynipsea'' flies prefer intermediate altitudes but are found at all altitudes where other species of dung flies are found.<ref name=ref10 /> In the areas where these fly species are prevalent, there is more species diversity at higher altitudes.<ref name=ref10 /> Higher altitude environments tend to be more variable, so species found at higher altitudes have to be better at adapting to environmental changes.<ref name=ref10 /> However, ''S. cynpisea'' flies at different altitudes enter [[Diapause]] at the same time and stop producing eggs at the same time in the season.<ref name=ref14>Blanckenhorn, W. U.  (1998). Altitudinal differentiation in the [[diapause]] response of two species of dung flies. Ecological Entomology 23, 1-8.</ref>\n\n===Temperature effects===\nTemperature during the larval phase of development impacts growth rates and final body size of ''Sepsis cynipsea''.<ref name=ref13 /> ''S. cynipsea'' grow the best at intermediate temperatures compared to similar species.<ref name=ref13 /> However, in colder temperatures, ''S. cynipsea'' growth rates may increase so that they can reach adulthood before a cold season. Their growth rate also increases with warmer temperatures.<ref name=ref13 /> At {{cvt|30|C|F}}, it takes approximately 7 days for ''S. cynipsea'' flies to mature from eggs to adults.<ref name=ref15 /> Resource availability, which can vary based on environmental conditions and competition with other species, also has an impact on the size of an adult body.<ref name=ref15 /> ''S. cynipsea'' primarily uses temperature to determine when to enter [[Diapause]].<ref name=ref14 />\n\n===Competition===\nBecause [[Sepsidae]] flies are often found in the same regions, there can be competition between species, like from ''S. neocynipsea'' which also prefers fresh cow dung for reproduction. However, some fly species, like ''S. duplicata'' prefer dry and old cow dung; this is known as [[niche differentiation]].<ref name=ref10 />\n\n==Mating==\n===Reproduction===\n''Sepsis cynipsea'' flies are most well known for their mating practices that involve [[sexual conflict]]. Their mating habits have been extensively studied to better understand sexual selection, female choice, and reluctance in mating.<ref name = ref1 /> ''Sepsis cynipsea'' flies require fresh dung to mate,<ref name= ref8>Teuschl, Y; Blanckenhorn, Wolf U (2007).

The females lay their eggs on the dung, and while they are laying their eggs, a male gets on top of the female and guards her.<ref name = ref2 /> Males are not selective for females; they tend to mount the first female they encounter on the dung.<ref name=ref12 /> However, this is not copulation. The eggs she is laying are fertilized from a previous mate.<ref name= ref8 /> After she lays her eggs on the fresh dung, she and the male move to the grass that surrounds the dung pile, where they have the opportunity to mate, although most pairs do not, as the female successfully shakes the male off.<ref name = ref8 /> If they do make genital contact and mate, the next eggs she lays will probably be his. When the eggs hatch and the larvae emerge, the larvae eat the dung and then leave.<ref name=ref13 /> ''S. cynipsea'' flies have evolved to develop quickly so they avoid competition with other coprophagous organisms and before the dung dries up.<ref name=ref13>Blanckenhorn, W. U. (1999). Different growth responses to temperature and resource limitation in three fly species with similar life histories. Evolutionary Ecology 13: 395-409</ref>\n\n===Sexual conflict===\nFemale ''Sepsis cynipsea'' flies are larger than the males, and because of this, a male cannot force a female to copulate with him.<ref name=ref2/> However, there is a lot of male competition.<ref name= ref3 /> There are usually far more males than females on a dung pile,<ref name= ref2 /> which leads to the ability for females to be selective.<ref name= ref8 /> If a female does not want to mate with a male, she begins to shake her body, which either indicates to males that she does not want to mate<ref name = ref2 /> or functions shake the male off of her body.<ref name = ref4>Wolf U. Blanckenhorn, David J. Hosken, Oliver Y. Martin, Constanze Reim, Yvonne Teuschl, Paul I. Ward, The costs of copulating in the dung fly Sepsis cynipsea, Behavioral Ecology, Volume 13, Issue 3, May 2002, Pages 353\u2013358, https://doi.org/10.1093/beheco/13.3.353</ref>\n\n=== Mate choice ===\nLarger males are more successful at mounting and mating with females, and larger females lay larger clutches of eggs.<ref name=ref15 /> In populations with greater mean body sizes, sexual selection is stronger compared to populations with smaller body sizes.<ref name=ref15 /> Once the male and female move into the grass after she lays her eggs, only about 40% of the pairs actually copulate.<ref name= ref8 /> And when they do, there is evidence to suggest that females get physically injured in the process. The male reproductive organ is spiney, and females are left with scars and have a higher mortality after mating.<ref name=ref4 /> This genital organ is most likely so armored to make it hard for the females to shake the males off; the male has to spin 180 degrees to get his genital organ out of the female.<ref name= ref4 /> If a female does not shake the male off, they copulate. The flies then find another dung site 2\u20134 days later to repeat the process.<ref name= ref8 /> This results in approximately six generations to progress during each breeding season.<ref name=ref15 />\n\n==Evolution==\n===Sexual dimorphisms===\nIn the family [[Sepsidae]], there is clear [[sexual dimorphism]]. The male foreleg, for example, differs greatly from a female foreleg, and differs in between [[Sepsidae]] species, as well.<ref name=ref12>Puniamoorthy, N., Su, K., & Meier, R. (2008). Bending for love: losses and gains of sexual dimorphisms are strictly correlated with changes in the mounting position of sepsid flies (Sepsidae: Diptera). BMC Evolutionary Biology, 8(1), 155. https://doi.org/10.1186/1471-2148-8-155</ref> The [[Morphology (biology)]] of the male foreleg evolved to aid the male in mounting the female and staying on her during her characteristic body shaking.<ref name=ref12 /> The male foreleg has evolved to have bristles, indentations, or bumps, which attach to the wing veins and cells on the female's wings.<ref name=ref12 /> In response to this, the female can bend her abdomen to prevent genital contact with the male.<ref name=ref12 /> In some [[Sepsidae]] species without adapted forelegs, the males have adapted an abdomen that bends to make contact with the female genitalia.<ref name=ref12 /> These sexually dimorphic characteristics can be very different between closely related species, so sexually dimorphic characteristics evolve quickly and are involved in speciation in the family [[Sepsidae]].\n\n===Taxonomy===\nThe family [[Sepsidae]] contains more than 320 species and 37 genera, which are globally widespread.<ref name=ref11>Zhao, L., Annie, A. S. H., Amrita, S., Yi, S. K. F., & Rudolf, M. (2013). Does better taxon sampling help?

J Zool Syst Evol Res. 2019; 57: 80\u2013 90. https://doi.org/10.1111/jzs.12239</ref> Even though both species are widespread, overlap geographically, and have similar mitochondrial gene sequences, they have different behaviors and morphologies.<ref name=ref6 /> While ''S. neocynipsea'' is most commonly found in North America, it is also present in some of the same geographic locations that ''S. cynipsea'' is found in, like the Swiss Alps.<ref name=ref6 /> While ''S. cynipsea'' and ''S. neocynipsea'' cross-breeding events can produce hybrid offspring, these offspring are typically infertile or have low fertility.<ref name=ref6 /> Pre- and post-zygotic barriers between the species are still forming, so they are recently diverged. In ''S. cynipsea'', female shaking during mating events is more visible than in ''S. neocynipsea''.<ref name=ref16>Giesen, A., Blanckenhorn, W. U., & Sch\u00e4fer, M. A. (2017).

Their growth rate also increases with warmer temperatures.<ref name=ref13 /> At {{cvt|30|C|F}}, it takes approximately 7 days for ''S. cynipsea'' flies to mature from eggs to adults.<ref name=ref15 /> Resource availability, which can vary based on environmental conditions and competition with other species, also has an impact on the size of an adult body.<ref name=ref15 /> ''S. cynipsea'' primarily uses temperature to determine when to enter [[Diapause]].<ref name=ref14 />\n\n===Competition===\nBecause [[Sepsidae]] flies are often found in the same regions, there can be competition between species, like from ''S. neocynipsea'' which also prefers fresh cow dung for reproduction. However, some fly species, like ''S. duplicata'' prefer dry and old cow dung; this is known as [[niche differentiation]].<ref name=ref10 />\n\n==Mating==\n===Reproduction===\n''Sepsis cynipsea'' flies are most well known for their mating practices that involve [[sexual conflict]]. Their mating habits have been extensively studied to better understand sexual selection, female choice, and reluctance in mating.<ref name = ref1 /> ''Sepsis cynipsea'' flies require fresh dung to mate,<ref name= ref8>Teuschl, Y; Blanckenhorn, Wolf U (2007). The reluctant fly: what makes Sepsis cynipsea females willing to copulate? Animal Behaviour, 73(1):85-97.</ref> and they prefer dung that is less than one hour old.<ref name= ref3>Parker, G..A.

Ethology, 106: 577-593. doi:10.1046/j.1439-0310.2000.00573.x</ref> and ingest fresh dung. The females lay their eggs on the dung, and while they are laying their eggs, a male gets on top of the female and guards her.<ref name = ref2 /> Males are not choosy for females; they tend to mount the first female they encounter on the dung.<ref name=ref12 /> However, this is not copulation. The eggs she is laying are fertilized from a previous mate.<ref name= ref8 /> After she lays her eggs on the fresh dung, she and the male move to the grass that surrounds the dung pile, where they have the opportunity to mate, although most pairs do not, as the female successfully shakes the male off.<ref name = ref8 /> If they do make genital contact and mate, the next eggs she lays will probably be his. When the eggs hatch and the larvae emerge, the larvae eat the dung and then leave.<ref name=ref13 /> ''S. cynipsea'' flies have evolved to develop quickly so they avoid competition with other coprophagous organisms and before the dung dries up.<ref name=ref13>Blanckenhorn, W. U. (1999). Different growth responses to temperature and resource limitation in three fly species with similar life histories. Evolutionary Ecology 13: 395-409</ref>\n\n===Sexual conflict===\nFemale ''Sepsis cynipsea'' flies are larger than the males, and because of this, a male cannot force a female to copulate with him.<ref name=ref2/> However, there is a lot of male competition.<ref name= ref3 /> There are usually far more males than females on a dung pile,<ref name= ref2 /> which leads to the ability for females to be choosy.<ref name= ref8 /> If a female does not want to mate with a male, she begins to shake her body, which either indicates to males that she does not want to mate<ref name = ref2 /> or functions shake the male off of her body.<ref name = ref4>Wolf U. Blanckenhorn, David J. Hosken, Oliver Y. Martin, Constanze Reim, Yvonne Teuschl, Paul I. Ward, The costs of copulating in the dung fly Sepsis cynipsea, Behavioral Ecology, Volume 13, Issue 3, May 2002, Pages 353\u2013358, https://doi.org/10.1093/beheco/13.3.353</ref>\n\n=== Mate choice ===\nLarger males are more successful at mounting and mating with females, and larger females lay larger clutches of eggs.<ref name=ref15 /> In populations with greater mean body sizes, sexual selection is stronger compared to populations with smaller body sizes.<ref name=ref15 /> Once the male and female move into the grass after she lays her eggs, only about 40% of the pairs actually copulate.<ref name= ref8 /> And when they do, there is evidence to suggest that females get physically injured in the process. The male reproductive organ is spiney, and females are left with scars and have a higher mortality after mating.<ref name=ref4 /> This genital organ is most likely so armored to make it hard for the females to shake the males off; the male has to spin 180 degrees to get his genital organ out of the female.<ref name= ref4 /> If a female does not shake the male off, they copulate. The flies then find another dung site 2\u20134 days later to repeat the process.<ref name= ref8 /> This results in approximately six generations to progress during each breeding season.<ref name=ref15 />\n\n==Evolution==\n===Sexual dimorphisms===\nIn the family [[Sepsidae]], there is clear [[sexual dimorphism]]. The male foreleg, for example, differs greatly from a female foreleg, and differs in between [[Sepsidae]] species, as well.<ref name=ref12>Puniamoorthy, N., Su, K., & Meier, R. (2008). Bending for love: losses and gains of sexual dimorphisms are strictly correlated with changes in the mounting position of sepsid flies (Sepsidae: Diptera). BMC Evolutionary Biology, 8(1), 155. https://doi.org/10.1186/1471-2148-8-155</ref> The [[Morphology (biology)]] of the male foreleg evolved to aid the male in mounting the female and staying on her during her characteristic body shaking.<ref name=ref12 /> The male foreleg has evolved to have bristles, indentations, or bumps, which attach to the wing veins and cells on the female's wings.<ref name=ref12 /> In response to this, the female can bend her abdomen to prevent genital contact with the male.<ref name=ref12 /> In some [[Sepsidae]] species without adapted forelegs, the males have adapted an abdomen that bends to make contact with the female genitalia.<ref name=ref12 /> These sexually dimorphic characteristics can be very different between closely related species, so sexually dimorphic characteristics evolve quickly and are involved in speciation in the family [[Sepsidae]].\n\n===Taxonomy===\nThe family [[Sepsidae]] contains more than 320 species and 37 genera, which are globally widespread.<ref name=ref11>Zhao, L., Annie, A. S. H., Amrita, S., Yi, S. K. F., & Rudolf, M. (2013). Does better taxon sampling help?

Geographic patterns of postzygotic isolation between two closely related widespread dung fly species (Sepsis cynipsea and Sepsis neocynipsea; Diptera: Sepsidae). J Zool Syst Evol Res. 2019; 57: 80\u2013 90. https://doi.org/10.1111/jzs.12239</ref> Even though both species are widespread, overlap geographically, and have similar mitochondrial gene sequences, they have different behaviors and morphologies.<ref name=ref6 /> While ''S. neocynipsea'' is most commonly found in North America, it is also present in some of the same geographic locations that ''S. cynipsea'' is found in, like the Swiss Alps.<ref name=ref6 /> While ''S. cynipsea'' and ''S. neocynipsea'' cross-breeding events can produce hybrid offspring, these offspring are typically infertile or have low fertility.<ref name=ref6 /> Pre- and post-zygotic barriers between the species are still forming, so they are recently diverged. In ''S. cynipsea'', female shaking during mating events is more visible than in ''S. neocynipsea''.<ref name=ref16>Giesen, A., Blanckenhorn, W. U., & Sch\u00e4fer, M. A. (2017).

Animal Behaviour, 132, 155\u2013166. https://doi.org/10.1016/j.anbehav.2017.08.008</ref> ''S. cynipsea'' flies also have higher rates of successful matings per mating attempts than ''S. neocynipsea'' do.<ref name=ref16 />\n\n===Genetics===\nThere are high levels of genetic variability between flies, especially on morphological traits. The heritability of these morphological traits ranges between 0.33-0.90 for males, but is lower for females.<ref name=\"ref9\">Reusch, T., & Blanckenhorn, W. U. (1998).

Witherspoon went on to choose the book as her September 2017 book club pick and soon after it was published it became an instant bestseller. Witherspoon then brought the book to [[Kerry Washington]], and together the pair approached [[Liz Tigelaar]] to adapt and showrun the novel as a limited series. The project began its development at ABC Signature, the cable/streaming division of ABC Studios where [[Hello Sunshine (company)|Hello Sunshine]] has a network-only deal and Simpson Street has an overall deal.<ref name=\"SeriesOrder\"/>\n\nOn March 2, 2018, the production was officially announced but a network had yet to be determined.
