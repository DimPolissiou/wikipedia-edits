{"title_page": "History of printing", "text_new": "{{short description|History of printing on paper}}\n{{History of printing}}\n\nThe '''history of printing''' starts as early as 3500 BC, when the Persian and Mesopotamian civilizations used [[cylinder seal]]s to certify documents written in clay. Other early forms include block seals, pottery imprints and cloth printing. [[Woodblock printing]] on paper originated in China around 200 AD. It led to the development of [[movable type]] in the eleventh century and the spread of book production in East Asia. Woodblock printing was also used in Europe, but it was in the fifteenth century that European printers developed a process for mass-producing metal type to support an economical book publishing industry. This industry enabled the communication of ideas and sharing of knowledge on an unprecedented scale. Alongside the development of text printing, new and lower-cost methods of image reproduction were developed, including [[lithography]], [[screen printing]] and [[photocopying]].\n\n==Stencil==\n[[File:SantaCruz-CuevaManos-P2210651b.jpg|thumb|Hands at the ''Cuevas de las Manos'' upon ''R\u00edo Pinturas'', near the town of Perito Moreno in [[:en:Santa Cruz Province (Argentina)|Santa Cruz Province]], [[Argentina]].]]\n{{Main|Stencil}}\n[[Hand stencils]], made by blowing pigment over a hand held against a wall, have been found in Asia and Europe dating from over 35,000 years ago, and later prehistoric dates in other continents.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Ghosh|first1=Pallab|title=Cave paintings change ideas about the origin of art|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-29415716|website=BBC News|publisher=BBC News}} \"The minimum age for (the outline of the hand) is 39,900 years old, which makes it the oldest hand stencil in the world,\" said Dr Aubert. \"Next to it is , and this is one of the oldest figurative depictions in the world, if not the oldest one,\" he told BBC News.

In the [[Western Zhou]], sets of seal stamps were encased in blocks of type and used on clay moulds for casting bronzes. By the end of the 3rd century BC seals were also used for printing on pottery. In the Northern dynasties textual sources contain references to wooden seals with up to 120 characters.{{sfn|Wilkinson|2012|p=909}}\n\nThe seals had a religious element to them. [[Daoists]] used seals as healing devices by impressing therapeutic characters onto the flesh of sick people. They were also used to stamp food, creating a talismanic character to ward off disease. The first evidence of these practices appeared under a Buddhist context in the mid 5th century. Centuries later seals were used to create hundreds of Buddha images.{{sfn|Wilkinson|2012|p=909}}\n\n== Stone and bronze blocks ==\nStone and bronze blocks have been used to print fabric.

It became widely used throughout [[East Asia]] both as a method for printing on [[textile]]s and later, under the influence of [[Buddhism]], on [[paper]]. As a method of printing on cloth, the earliest surviving examples from [[China]] date to about 220. ''[[Ukiyo-e]]'' is the best known type of [[Japan]]ese woodblock art print. Most European uses of the technique on paper are covered by the term [[woodcut]] (see below), except for the [[woodblock printing#Block-books in fifteenth century Europe|block-books]] produced mainly in the fifteenth century.<ref>{{cite web|title=History of Printing Timeline|url=https://printinghistory.org/timeline/|website=American Printing History Association: To Encourage the Study of Printing History|accessdate=22 December 2015}}</ref>\n\n===Legendary origins===\nAccording to southern Chinese histories, in the 480s, a man named Gong Xuanxuan styled himself Gong the Sage and 'said that a supernatural being had given him a \"jade seal jade block writing,\" which did not require a brush: one blew on the paper and characters formed.'{{sfn|Barrett|2008|p=60}} He then used his powers to mystify a local governor. Eventually he was dealt with by the governor's successor, who presumably executed Gong.{{sfn|Barrett|2008|p=50}} Timothy Hugh Barrett postulates that Gong's magical jade block was actually a printing device, and Gong was one of the first, if not the first printer. The semi-mythical record of him therefore describes his usage of the printing process to deliberately bewilder onlookers and create an image of mysticism around himself.{{sfn|Barrett|2008|p=61}}\n\n===In the Sinosphere===\n{{Main|History of printing in East Asia}}\n\nThe rise of printing was greatly influenced by [[Mahayana Buddhism]]. According to Mahayana beliefs, religious texts hold intrinsic value for carrying the Buddha's word and act as talismanic objects containing sacred power capable of warding off evil spirits. By copying and preserving these texts, Buddhists could accrue personal merit. As a consequence the idea of printing and its advantages in replicating texts quickly became apparent to Buddhists, who by the 7th century, were using woodblocks to create apotropaic documents. These Buddhist texts were printed specifically as ritual items and were not widely circulated or meant for public consumption. Instead they were buried in consecrated ground. The earliest extant example of this type of printed matter is a fragment of a dh\u0101ra\u1e47\u012b (Buddhist spell) miniature scroll written in Sanskrit unearthed in a tomb in [[Xi'an]]. It is called the ''Great spell of unsullied pure light'' (''Wugou jingguang da tuoluoni jing'' \u7121\u57a2\u6de8\u5149\u5927\u9640\u7f85\u5c3c\u7d93) and was printed using woodblock during the Tang dynasty, c. 650\u2013670.{{sfn|Wilkinson|2012|p=910}} A similar piece, the ''Saddharma pundarika'' sutra, was also discovered and dated to 690 to 699.<ref name=\"pan 1997 179 180\">{{cite journal |last=Pan |first=Jixing |title=On the Origin of Printing in the Light of New Archaeological Discoveries |journal=Chinese Science Bulletin |year=1997 |volume=42 |issue=12 |pages=976\u2013981 [pp. 979\u2013980] |issn=1001-6538 |doi=10.1007/BF02882611 }}</ref> This coincides with the reign of [[Wu Zetian]], under which the [[Longer Sukh\u0101vat\u012bvy\u016bha S\u016btra]], which advocates the practice of printing apotropaic and merit making texts and images, was translated by Chinese monks.{{sfn|Wilkinson|2012|p=910}}\n\nEvidence of woodblock printing appeared in Korea and Japan soon afterward.

This copy of the [[Diamond Sutra]] is 14 feet long and contains a [[Colophon (publishing)|colophon]] at the inner end, which reads: ''Reverently [caused to be] made for universal free distribution by Wang Jie on behalf of his two parents on the 13th of the 4th moon of the 9th year of Xiantong [i.e. 11 May, AD 868 ]''. It is considered the world's oldest securely-dated woodblock scroll.{{sfn|Wilkinson|2012|p=910}}\n\nThe Diamond sutra was closely followed by the earliest extant printed almanac, the ''Qianfu sinian lishu'' (\u4e7e\u7b26\u56db\u5e74\u66c6\u66f8), dated to 877.{{sfn|Wilkinson|2012|p=910}}\n\nFrom 932 to 955 the [[Thirteen Classics|Twelve Classics]] and an assortment of other texts were printed. During the [[Song dynasty]], the Directorate of education and other agencies used these block prints to disseminate their standardized versions of the ''Classics''. Other disseminated works include the ''Histories'', philosophical works, encyclopedias, collections, and books on medicine and the art of war.{{sfn|Wilkinson|2012|p=910}}\n\nIn 971 work began on the complete [[Tripi\u1e6daka]] Buddhist Canon (''Kaibao zangshu'' \u958b\u5bf6\u85cf\u66f8) in [[Chengdu]]. It took 10 years to finish the 130,000 blocks needed to print the text. The finished product, the [[Sichuan]] edition of the ''Kaibao canon'', also known as the ''Kaibao Tripitaka'', was printed in 983.{{sfn|Wilkinson|2012|p=910}}\n\nIn 989 [[Seongjong of Goryeo]] sent the monk Yeoga to request from the Song a copy of the complete Buddhist canon. The request was granted in 991 when Seongjong's official Han Eongong visited the Song court.<ref>https://digital.lib.washington.edu/researchworks/bitstream/handle/1773/24231/Hyun_washington_0250E_12384.pdf?sequence=1 p. 191.</ref> In 1011, [[Hyeonjong of Goryeo]] issued the carving of their own set of the Buddhist canon, which would come to be known as the ''[[Goryeo Daejanggyeong]]''. The project was suspended in 1031 after Heyongjong's death, but work resumed again in 1046 after [[Munjong of Goryeo|Munjong]]'s accession to the throne. The completed work, amounting to some 6,000 volumes, was finished in 1087. Unfortunately the original set of woodblocks was destroyed in a conflagration during the [[Mongol invasions of Korea|Mongol invasion]] of 1232. King [[Gojong of Goryeo|Gojong]] ordered another set to be created and work began in 1237, this time only taking 12 years to complete. In 1248 the complete ''[[Goryeo Daejanggyeong]]'' numbered 81,258 printing blocks, 52,330,152 characters, 1496 titles, and 6568 volumes. Due to the stringent editing process that went into the ''Goryeo Daejanggyeong'' and its surprisingly enduring nature, having survived completely intact over 760 years, it is considered the most accurate of Buddhist canons written in [[Classical Chinese]] as well as a standard edition for East Asian Buddhist scholarship.<ref name=\"Memory\">{{cite web|title=Printing woodblocks of the Tripitaka Koreana and miscellaneous Buddhist scriptures|url=http://www.unesco.org/new/en/communication-and-information/memory-of-the-world/register/full-list-of-registered-heritage/registered-heritage-page-7/printing-woodblocks-of-the-tripitaka-koreana-and-miscellaneous-buddhist-scriptures/|website=UNESCO Memory of the World|publisher=United Nations|accessdate=30 July 2016}}</ref>\n\n====Impact of woodblock printing====\nPrior to the introduction of printing, the size of private collections in China had already seen an increase since the invention of paper. Fan Ping (215-84) had in his collection 7,000 rolls (''juan''), or a few hundred titles. Two centuries later, Zhang Mian owned 10,000 ''juan'', [[Shen Yue]] (441-513) 20,000 ''juan'', and [[Xiao Tong]] and his cousin Xiao Mai both had collections of 30,000 ''juan''. [[Emperor Yuan of Liang]] (508-555) was said to have had a collection of 80,000 ''juan''. The combined total of all known private book collectors prior to the Song dynasty number around 200, with the Tang alone accounting for 60 of them.{{sfn|Wilkinson|2012|p=930}}\n\nFollowing the maturation of woodblock printing, official, commercial, and private publishing businesses emerged while the size and number of collections grew exponentially. The Song dynasty alone accounts for some 700 known private collections, more than triple the number of all the preceding centuries combined. Private libraries of 10\u201320,000 ''juan'' became commonplace while six individuals owned collections of over 30,000 ''juan''. The earliest extant private Song library catalogue lists 1,937 titles in 24,501 ''juan''. Zhou Mi's collection numbered 42,000 ''juan'', Chen Zhensun's collection lists 3,096 titles in 51,180 ''juan'', and [[Ye Mengde]] (1077-1148) as well as one other individual owned libraries of 6,000 titles in 100,000 ''juan''. The majority of which were secular in nature. Texts contained material such as medicinal instruction or came in the form of a ''[[leishu]]'' (\u985e\u66f8), a type of encyclopedic reference book used to help [[imperial examinations|examination]] candidates.{{sfn|Wilkinson|2012|p=910}}{{sfn|Wilkinson|2012|p=930}}\n\nImperial establishments such as the Three Institutes: Zhaowen Institute, History Institute, and Jixian Institute also followed suit. At the start of the dynasty the Three Institutes' holdings numbered 13,000 ''juan'', by the year 1023 39,142 ''juan'', by 1068 47,588 ''juan'', and by 1127 73,877 ''juan''. The Three Institutes were one of several imperial libraries, with eight other major palace libraries, not including imperial academies.{{sfn|Chia|2011|p=43}} According to Weng Tongwen, by the 11th century, central government offices were saving tenfold by substituting earlier manuscripts with printed versions.{{sfn|Chia|2011|p=21}} The impact of woodblock printing on Song society is illustrated in the following exchange between [[Emperor Zhenzong]] and Xing Bing in the year 1005:\n\n{{quotation|The emperor went to the Directorate of Education to inspect the Publications Office. He asked Xing Bing how many woodblocks were kept there. Bing replied, \"At the start of our dynasty, there were fewer than four thousand. Today, there are more than one hundred thousand. The classics and histories, together with standard commentaries, are all fully represented. When I was young and devoted myself to learning, there were only one or two scholars in every hundred who possessed copies of all the classics and commentaries. There was no way to copy so many works. Today, printed editions of these works are abundant, and officials and commoners alike have them in their homes. Scholars are fortunate indeed to have been born in such an era as ours!{{sfn|Chia|2011|p=33}}}}\n\nIn 1076, the 39 year old [[Su Shi]] remarked upon the unforeseen effect an abundance of books had on examination candidates:\n\n{{quotation|I can recall meeting older scholars, long ago, who said that when they were young they had a hard time getting their hands on a copy of ''Shiji'' or ''Han shu''. If they were lucky enough to get one, they thought nothing of copying the entire text out by hand, so they could recite it day and night. In recent years merchants engrave and print all manner of books belonging to the hundred schools, and produce ten thousand pages a day. With books so readily available, you would think that students' writing and scholarship would be many times better than what they were in earlier generations. Yet, to the contrary, young men and examination candidates leave their books tied shut and never look at them, preferring to amuse themselves with baseless chatter. Why is this?{{sfn|Chia|2011|p=38}}}}\n\nWoodblock printing also changed the shape and structure of books. Scrolls were gradually replaced by concertina binding (\u7d93\u647a\u88dd) from the Tang period onward. The advantage was that it was now possible to flip to a reference without unfolding the entire document. The next development known as whirlwind binding (''xuanfeng zhuang'' \u65cb\u98a8\u88dd) was to secure the first and last leaves to a single large sheet, so that the book could be opened like an accordion.{{sfn|Wilkinson|2012|p=912}}\n\nAround the year 1000, butterfly binding was developed. Woodblock prints allowed two mirror images to be easily replicated on a single sheet. Thus two pages were printed on a sheet, which was then folded inwards. The sheets were then pasted together at the fold to make a [[codex]] with alternate openings of printed and blank pairs of pages. In the 14th century the folding was reversed outwards to give continuous printed pages, each backed by a blank hidden page. Later the sewn bindings were preferred rather than pasted bindings.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://idp.bl.uk/IDP/bookbinding/CONCERTINA-FRAMESET.html |title=Dunhuang concertina binding findings |accessdate=2000-03-09 |url-status=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20000309034110/http://idp.bl.uk/IDP/bookbinding/CONCERTINA-FRAMESET.html |archivedate=2000-03-09 }}</ref> Only relatively small volumes (''[[:wiktionary:\u83e4|juan \u5377]]'') were bound up, and several of these would be enclosed in a cover called a ''tao'', with wooden boards at front and back, and loops and pegs to close up the book when not in use. For example, one complete Tripitaka had over 6,400 ''juan'' in 595 ''tao''.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.nb.no/baser/schoyen/5/5.18/#2540 |title=Archived copy |access-date=2017-07-23 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061104033156/http://www.nb.no/baser/schoyen/5/5.18/#2540 |archive-date=2006-11-04 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nDespite the productive effect of woodblock printing, historian Endymion Wilkinson notes that it never supplanted handwritten manuscripts. Indeed, manuscripts remained dominant until the very end of Imperial China:\n\n{{quotation|As a result of block-printing technology, it became easier and cheaper to produce multiple copies of books quickly. By the eleventh century, the price of books had fallen by about one tenth what they had been before and as a result they were more widely disseminated. Nevertheless, even in the fifteenth century most books in major libraries were still in manuscript, not in print. Almost to the end of the empire it remained cheaper to pay a copyist than to buy a printed book. Seven hundred and fifty years after the first imperially sponsored printed works in the Northern Song, the greatest book project of the eighteenth century, the ''[[Siku quanshu]]'' \u56db\u5eab\u5168\u66f8, was produced as a manuscript, not as a printed collection. About 4 percent of it was printed in movable type in 1773, but it was hand-carved movable wooden type. Indeed, the entire collection was only printed for the first time in the 1980s. Access to books, especially large works, such as the ''Histories'', remained difficult right into the twentieth century.{{sfn|Wilkinson|2012|p=910-911}}|Endymion Wilkinson}}\n\nNot only did manuscripts remain competitive with imprints,<ref>In late Ming/early Qing China, cost for copying 20 to 30 pages was around .02 to .03 tael, which worked out to something like 0.005 tael per hundred characters, while a carver was typically paid .0.02 to 0.03 tael per hundred characters carved, and could carve 100 to 150 characters a day. \"Publishing, Culture, and Power in Early Modern China\", Kai-Wing Chow, 2004, Stanford University Press, page 36</ref> they were even ''preferred'' by elite scholars and collectors. The age of printing gave the act of copying by hand a new dimension of cultural reverence. Those who considered themselves real scholars and true connoisseurs of the book did not consider imprints to be real books. Under the elitist attitudes of the time, \"printed books were for those who did not truly care about books.\"{{sfn|Chia|2011|p=41}}\n\nHowever, copyists and manuscript only continued to remain competitive with printed editions by dramatically reducing their price. According to the [[Ming dynasty]] author [[Hu Yinglin]], \"if no printed edition were available on the market, the hand-copied manuscript of a book would cost ten times as much as the printed work,\"{{sfn|Tsien|1985|p=373}} also \"once a printed edition appeared, the transcribed copy could no longer be sold and would be discarded.\"{{sfn|Tsien|1985|p=373}} The result is that despite the mutual co-existence of hand-copied manuscripts and printed texts, the cost of the book had declined by about 90 percent by the end of the 16th century.{{sfn|Tsien|1985|p=373}} As a result, literacy increased. In 1488, the [[Koreans|Korean]] [[Choe Bu]] observed during his trip to China that \"even village children, ferrymen, and sailors\" could read, although this applied mainly to the south while northern China remained largely illiterate.{{sfn|Twitchett|1998b|p=636}}\n\n===In India===\n\nIn Buddhism, great merit is thought to accrue from copying and preserving texts. The 4th-century{{Fix|text=which?}} master{{Fix|text=who?}} listed the copying of scripture as the first of ten essential religious practices. The importance of perpetuating texts is set out with special force in the [[Infinite Life Sutra|longer Sukh\u0101vat\u012bvy\u016bha S\u016btra]], which urges the devout not only to hear, learn, remember and study the text but to obtain a good copy and to preserve it. This \"cult of the book\" led to techniques for reproducing texts in great numbers, especially the short prayers or charms known as ''dh\u0101ra\u1e47\u012bs''. Stamps were carved for printing these prayers on clay tablets from at least the 7th century, the date of the oldest surviving examples.<ref>Zwalf, ''Buddhism: Art and Faith'' (London: British Museum, 1985).</ref>\n\n===In Europe===\n{{see also|History of Western typography}}\nPrinting with a press was practiced in Christian Europe as a method for printing on cloth, where it was common by 1300. Images printed on cloth for religious purposes could be quite large and elaborate, and when [[paper]] became relatively easily available, around 1400, the medium transferred very quickly to small [[woodcut]] religious images and [[playing cards]] printed on paper. These [[old master print|prints]] were produced in very large numbers from about 1425 onwards.<ref name=\"Reference A\">An Introduction to a History of Woodcut, Arthur M.

There is still some controversy among scholars as to whether their introduction preceded or, the majority view, followed the introduction of movable type, with the range of estimated dates being between about 1440\u20131460.<ref name=\"Reference B\">Master E.S., Alan Shestack, Philadelphia Museum of Art, 1967</ref>\n\n==Movable type (1041)==\n\n{{Main|Movable type}}\n{{See also|History of typography in East Asia}}\n\n'''Movable type''' is the system of [[printing]] and [[typography]] using individual pieces of type.\n\n===Ceramic movable-type===\nMovable-type was invented in the [[Northern Song dynasty]] around the year 1041 by the commoner [[Bi Sheng]].

Even in Korea where metal movable type was most widespread, it still never replaced woodblock printing. Indeed, even the promulgation of [[Hangeul]] was done through woodblock prints. The general assumption is that movable type did not replace block printing in places that used Chinese characters due to the expense of producing more than 200,000 individual pieces of type. Even woodblock printing was not as cost productive as simply paying a copyist to write out a book by hand if there was no intention of producing more than a few copies. Although [[Sejong the Great]] introduced Hangeul, an alphabetic system, in the 15th century, Hangeul only replaced [[Hanja]] in the 20th century.{{sfn|Wilkinson|2012|p=911}} And unlike China, the movable type system was kept mainly within the confines of a highly stratified elite Korean society:\n\n{{quotation|Korean printing with movable metallic type developed mainly within the royal foundry of the Yi dynasty. Royalty kept a monopoly of this new technique and by royal mandate suppressed all non-official printing activities and any budding attempts at commercialization of printing. Thus, printing in early Korea served only the small, noble groups of the highly stratified society.<ref>Sohn, Pow-Key, \"Early Korean Printing,\" ''Journal of the American Oriental Society'', Vol. 79, No. 2 (April -June , 1959), pp.&nbsp;96-103 (103).</ref>|Sohn Pow-Key}}\n\nOnly during the Ming and Qing dynasties did wooden and metal movable types see any considerable use, but the preferred method remained woodblock. Usage of movable type in China never exceeded 10 percent of all printed materials while 90 percent of printed books used the older woodblock technology. In one case an entire set of wooden type numbering 250,000 pieces was used for firewood.{{sfn|Wilkinson|2012|p=912}} Woodblocks remained the dominant printing method in China until the introduction of [[lithography]] in the late 19th century.{{sfn|Wilkinson|2012|p=909}}\n\nIn Japan the use of printing beyond its Buddhist origins was insignificant for centuries after its introduction. Printing of secular materials did not pick up until the late 16th century. The ''Setsuy\u014d-sh\u016b'', a two-volume Chinese-Japanese dictionary printed in 1591, was the first secular book to be printed in Japan. Only after [[Toyotomi Hideyoshi]]'s [[Japanese invasions of Korea (1592\u201398)|invasions of Korea]], which brought back artisans and printing equipment in 1593, did Japan acquire its own wooden type font. Under [[Emperor Go-Y\u014dzei]]'s orders, the [[Confucian]] ''[[Analects]]'' were printed using metal movable type in 1598. It is generally considered to be the earliest extant Japanese text printed using metal movable type. The popularity of movable type in Japan was short lived. By the 1640s woodblock printing had reasserted itself as the dominant mode of printing in Japan.<ref>Sansom, George (1961). \"A History of Japan: 1334-1615.\" Stanford, California: Stanford University Press.</ref>\n\n====Controversy====\nTraditionally it has been assumed that the prevalence of woodblock printing in East Asia as a result of Chinese characters led to the stagnation of printing culture and enterprise in that region. S. H. Steinberg describes woodblock printing in his ''Five Hundred Years of Printing'' as having \"outlived their usefulness\" and their printed material as \"cheap tracts for the half-literate, ... which anyway had to be very brief because of the laborious process of cutting the letters.\"{{sfn|Barrett|2008|p=10}} John Man's ''The Gutenberg Revolution'' makes a similar case: \"wood-blocks were even more demanding than manuscript pages to make, and they wore out and broke, and then you had to carve another one - a whole page at a time.\"{{sfn|Barrett|2008|p=10}}\n\nRecent commentaries on printing in China using contemporary European observers with first hand knowledge complicate the traditional narrative. T. H. Barrett points out that only Europeans who had never seen Chinese woodblock printing in action tended to dismiss it, perhaps due to the almost instantaneous arrival of both xylography and movable type in Europe. The early Jesuit missionaries of late 16th century China, for instance, had a similar distaste for wood based printing for very different reasons. These Jesuits found that \"the cheapness and omnipresence of printing in China made the prevailing wood-based technology extremely disturbing, even dangerous.\"{{sfn|Barrett|2008|p=11}} [[Matteo Ricci]] made note of \"the exceedingly large numbers of books in circulation here and the ridiculously low prices at which they are sold.\"{{sfn|Twitchett|1998b|p=637}} Two hundred years later the Englishman John Barrow, by way of the [[Macartney Embassy|Macartney mission]] to Qing China, also remarked with some amazement that the printing industry was \"as free as in England, and the profession of printing open to everyone.\"{{sfn|Barrett|2008|p=11}} The commercial success and profitability of woodblock printing was attested to by one British observer at the end of the nineteenth century, who noted that even before the arrival of western printing methods, the price of books and printed materials in [[History of China|China]] had already reached an astoundingly low price compared to what could be found in his home country. Of this, he said:\n\n{{quotation|We have an extensive penny literature at home, but the [[English people|English]] cottager cannot buy anything like the amount of printed matter for his penny that the [[Chinaman (term)|Chinaman]] can for even less. A penny Prayer-book, admittedly sold at a loss, cannot compete in mass of matter with many of the books to be bought for a few [[Cash (Chinese coin)|cash]] in China. When it is considered, too, that a block has been laboriously cut for each leaf, the cheapness of the result is only accounted for by the wideness of sale.{{sfn|Barrett|2008|p=14}}}}\n\nOther modern scholars such as Endymion Wilkinson hold a more conservative and skeptical view.

The metal type pieces were more durable and the lettering was more uniform, leading to typography and [[font]]s. The high quality and relatively low price of the [[Gutenberg Bible]] (1455) established the superiority of movable type, and printing presses rapidly spread across Europe, leading up to the [[Renaissance]], and later all around the world. Today, practically all movable type printing ultimately derives from Gutenberg's movable type printing, which is often regarded as the most important invention of the second millennium.<ref>In 1997, [[Time Life]] magazine picked Gutenberg's invention to be the most important of the second millennium.{{Citation needed|date=May 2019}} In 1999, the A&E Network voted Johannes Gutenberg \"Man of the Millennium\".{{Citation needed|date=May 2019}} See also [http://pirate.shu.edu/~gottlitr/mil_site/lista.html 1,000 Years, 1,000 People: Ranking The Men and Women Who Shaped The Millennium] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071012221307/http://pirate.shu.edu/~gottlitr/mil_site/lista.html |date=2007-10-12 }} which was composed by four prominent US journalists in 1998.</ref>\n\nGutenberg is also credited with the introduction of an oil-based ink which was more durable than previously used water-based inks. Having worked as a professional [[goldsmith]], Gutenberg made skillful use of his knowledge of metals. He was also the first to make his type from an [[alloy]] of lead, tin, and [[antimony]], known as [[type metal]], printer's lead, or printer's metal, which was critical for producing durable type that produced high-quality printed books, and proved to be more suitable for printing than the clay, wooden or bronze types used in East Asia. To create these lead types, Gutenberg used what some considered his most ingenious invention: a special matrix which enabled the moulding of new movable types with an unprecedented precision at short notice. Within a year of printing the Gutenberg Bible, Gutenberg also published the first coloured prints.\n\nThe invention of the printing press revolutionized communication and book production, leading to the spread of knowledge. Printing was rapidly spread from Germany by emigrating German printers, but also by foreign apprentices returning home. A printing press was built in [[Venice]] in 1469, and by 1500 the city had 417 printers. In 1470 [[Johann Heynlin]] set up a printing press in [[Paris]]. In 1473 [[Kasper Straube]] published the ''[[Almanach cracoviense ad annum 1474]]'' in [[Krak\u00f3w]]. [[Dirk Martens]] set up a printing press in [[Aalst, Belgium|Aalst]] ([[Flanders]]) in 1473. He printed a book about the two lovers of [[Enea Piccolomini]] who became [[Pope Pius II]]. In 1476 a printing press was set up in England by [[William Caxton]]. The Italian Juan Pablos set up an imported press in [[Mexico City]] in 1539. The first printing press in [[Southeast Asia]] was set up in the [[Philippines]] by the [[Spanish Empire|Spanish]] in 1593. The Rev. Jose Glover intended to bring the first printing press to England's American colonies in 1638, but died on the voyage, so his widow, Elizabeth Harris Glover, established the printing house, which was run by Stephen Day and became The Cambridge Press.<ref>Stowell, Marion B.

Some master printing houses, like that of [[Aldus Manutius]], became the cultural center for [[Intellectual|literati]] such as [[Erasmus]].\n\n*Print shop apprentices: Apprentices, usually between the ages of 15 and 20, worked for master printers. Apprentices were not required to be literate, and literacy rates at the time were very low, in comparison to today. Apprentices prepared ink, dampened sheets of paper, and assisted at the press. An apprentice who wished to learn to become a compositor had to learn Latin and spend time under the supervision of a journeyman.\n*Journeyman printers: After completing their apprenticeships, ''journeyman''  printers were free to move employers. This facilitated the spread of printing to areas that were less print-centred.\n*Compositors: Those who set the type for printing.\n*Pressmen: the person who worked the press. This was physically labour-intensive.\n\nThe earliest-known image of a European, Gutenberg-style print shop is the ''Dance of Death'' by Matthias Huss, at Lyon, 1499. This image depicts a compositor standing at a compositor's case being grabbed by a skeleton. The case is raised to facilitate his work.  At the right of the printing house a bookshop is shown.\n\n====Financial aspects====\nAccording to court records from the city of Mainz, Johannes Fust was for some time Gutenberg's financial backer. By the 16th century jobs in printing were becoming increasingly specialized. Structures{{clarify|date=June 2017}} supporting publishers were more and more complex, leading to division of labour. In Europe between 1500 and 1700 the role of the Master Printer was dying out and giving way to the bookseller\u2014publisher. During this period, printing had a stronger commercial imperative than previously. Risks associated with the industry however were substantial, although dependent on the nature of the publication.\n\nBookseller publishers negotiated at trade fairs and at print shops. Jobbing work appeared: some printers performed menial tasks at the beginning of their careers to support themselves.\n\nFrom 150 to 1700 publishers developed several new methods of funding projects:\n\n# Cooperative associations/publication syndicates\u2014a number of individuals shared the risks associated with printing and shared in the profit. This was pioneered by the French.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}\n# Subscription publishing: pioneered by the English in the early 17th century.<ref>\"The Beginnings of Subscription Publication in the Seventeenth Century\", Sarah L. C. Clapp, ''Modern Philology''. Vol. 29 No. 2, 1931, pp. 199-224, University of Chicago Press</ref>  A prospectus for a publication was drawn up by a publisher to raise funding. The prospectus was given to potential buyers who signed up for a copy. If there were not enough subscriptions the publication did not go ahead. Lists of subscribers were included in the books as endorsements. If enough people subscribed, there might be a reprint. Some authors used subscription publication to bypass the publisher entirely.\n# Installment publishing: books were issued in parts until a complete book had been issued. This was not necessarily done within a fixed time period. It was an effective method of spreading the cost over a period of time. It also allowed earlier returns on investment to help cover the production costs of subsequent installments.\n\nThe ''Mechanick Exercises'', by Joseph Moxon, in London, 1683, was said to be the first publication in installments.<ref name=\"serial\">{{cite book |last1=Wiles |first1=R. M. |date= |year=2012 |title=Serial Publication in England Before 1750 |trans-title= |url=https://books.google.fr/books?id=SL2gM5RygKwC |access-date=|format= |language=English |location= |publisher=Cambridge University Press |page=79 |pages= |isbn= |via= |subscription= |quote= |trans-quote=}}</ref>\n\nPublishing trade organizations allowed publishers to organize business concerns collectively. These arrangements included systems of self-regulation. For example, if one publisher did something to irritate other publishers he would be controlled by peer pressure. Such systems are known as [[cartel]]s, and are in most countries now considered to be in restraint of trade. These arrangements helped deal with labour unrest among journeymen, who faced difficult working conditions. Brotherhoods predated unions, without the formal regulations now associated with unions.\n\nIn most cases, publishers bought the [[copyright]] in a work from the author, and made some arrangement about the possible profits. This required a substantial amount of capital in addition to that needed for the physical equipment and staff. Alternatively, an author with some capital available would sometimes keep the copyright himself, and simply pay the printer to print the book.\n\n====Rotary printing press====\n{{Main|Rotary printing press}}\nIn a rotary printing press, the impressions are carved around a cylinder so that the printing can be done on long continuous rolls of paper, [[Paperboard|cardboard]], [[plastic]], or a large number of other substrates. Rotary drum printing was invented by [[Richard March Hoe]] in 1843 and patented in 1847, and then significantly improved by [[William Bullock (inventor)|William Bullock]] in 1863.\n\n==Intaglio==\n[[File:Intaglio-printing.svg|thumb|right|Intaglio printing. The top line is the paper, to which a slightly raised layer of ink adheres; the matrix is beneath]]\n{{Main|Intaglio (printmaking)}}\nIntaglio ({{IPAc-en|\u026a|n|\u02c8|t|\u00e6|l|i|o\u028a}}) is a family of [[printmaking]] techniques in which the image is incised into a surface, known as the matrix or plate. Normally, [[copper]] or [[zinc]] plates are used as a surface, and the incisions are created by [[etching]], [[engraving]], [[drypoint]], [[aquatint]] or [[mezzotint]]. [[Collography|Collographs]] may also be printed as intaglio plates.  To print an intaglio plate the surface is covered in thick ink and then rubbed with [[tarlatan]] cloth to remove most of the excess. The final smooth wipe is usually done by hand, sometimes with the aid of newspaper or old public phone book pages, leaving ink only in the incisions. A damp piece of paper is placed on top and the plate and paper are run through a printing press that, through pressure, transfers the ink from the recesses of the plate to the paper.\n\n==Lithography (1796)==\n[[File:Litography press with map of Moosburg 02.jpg|thumb|left|Lithography press for printing maps in Munich.]][[File:Lithography stone Princeton motif.jpg|thumb|Stone used for a lithograph with a view of [[Princeton University]]\n(Collection: Princeton University Library, NJ)]]\n{{Main|Lithography}}\nInvented by Bavarian author [[Aloys Senefelder]] in 1796,<ref name=\"meggspage146\">Meggs, Philip B. A History of Graphic Design. \u00a91998 John Wiley & Sons, Inc. p 146 {{ISBN|0-471-29198-6}}</ref> '''lithography''' is a method for printing on a smooth surface. Lithography is a printing process that uses chemical processes to create an image. For instance, the positive part of an image would be a [[hydrophobic]] chemical, while the negative image would be water. Thus, when the plate is introduced to a compatible ink and water mixture, the ink will adhere to the positive image and the water will clean the negative image.  This allows for a relatively flat print plate which allows for much longer runs than the older physical methods of imaging (e.g., embossing or engraving).\nHigh-volume lithography is used today to produce posters, maps, books, newspapers, and packaging \u2014 just about any smooth, mass-produced item with print and graphics on it. Most books, indeed all types of high-volume text, are now printed using [[offset lithography]].\n\nIn offset lithography, which depends on photographic processes, flexible aluminum, polyester, mylar or paper printing plates are used in place of stone tablets. Modern printing plates have a brushed or roughened texture and are covered with a photosensitive [[emulsion]]. A photographic negative of the desired image is placed in contact with the emulsion and the plate is exposed to ultraviolet light. After development, the emulsion shows a reverse of the negative image, which is thus a duplicate of the original (positive) image. The image on the plate emulsion can also be created through direct laser imaging in a CTP ([[Computer to plate|Computer-To-Plate]]) device called a platesetter. The positive image is the emulsion that remains after imaging. For many years, chemicals have been used to remove the non-image emulsion, but now plates are available that do not require chemical processing.\n\n==Color printing==\n{{Main|Colour printing|Woodcut}}\n[[File:Uncle Sam Supplying the World with Berry Brothers Hard Oil Finish.jpg|thumb|right|Calvert Lithographic Company, Detroit, MI. ''Uncle Sam Supplying the World with Berry Brothers Hard Oil Finish,'' c. 1880. Noel Wisdom Chromolithograph Collection, Special Collections Department, The University of South Florida Tampa Library.]]\nAccording to Michael Sullivan, the earliest known example of color printing \"is a two-color frontispiece to a Buddhist sutra scroll, dated 1346\". Color printing continued to be used in China throughout the [[Ming Dynasty|Ming]] and [[Qing Dynasty]].<ref name=\"Sullivan\">{{cite book|author=Michael Sullivan|title=The Arts of China|url=https://archive.org/details/bub_gb_CzdICSqnELkC|edition=Third|date=18 June 1984|publisher=University of California Press|isbn=978-0-520-04918-5|page=[https://archive.org/details/bub_gb_CzdICSqnELkC/page/n222 203]}}</ref>\n\n[[Chromolithography]] became the most successful of several methods of [[colour printing]] developed by the 19th century; other methods were developed by printers such as [[Jacob Christoph Le Blon]], [[George Baxter (printer)|George Baxter]] and [[Edmund Evans]], and mostly relied on using several [[woodcut|woodblocks]] with the colors. Hand-coloring also remained important; elements of the official British [[Ordnance Survey]] maps were colored by hand by boys until 1875.  Chromolithography developed from lithography and the term covers various types of lithography that are printed in color.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://seeing.nypl.org/planographic.html|title=Planographic Printing|date=1999-10-23|accessdate=2014-11-21|publisher=The New York Public Library}}</ref> The initial technique involved the use of multiple lithographic stones, one for each color, and was still extremely expensive when done for the best quality results. Depending on the number of colors present, a chromolithograph could take months to produce, by very skilled workers.  However much cheaper prints could be produced by simplifying both the number of colors used, and the refinement of the detail in the image.  Cheaper images, like the advertisement illustrated, relied heavily on an initial black print (not always a lithograph), on which colors were then overprinted. To make an expensive reproduction print as what was once referred to as a \"\u2019chromo\u2019\", a lithographer, with a finished painting in front of him, gradually created and corrected the many stones using proofs to look as much as possible like the painting in front of him, sometimes using dozens of layers.<ref>Clapper, Michael. \"'I Was Once a Barefoot Boy!': Cultural Tensions in a Popular Chromo.\" American Art 16(2002): 16-39.</ref>\n\nAloys Senefelder, the inventor of lithography, introduced the subject of colored lithography in his 1818 ''Vollstaendiges Lehrbuch der Steindruckerey (A Complete Course of Lithography)'', where he told of his plans to print using color and explained the colors he wished to be able to print someday.<ref name=\"ferry_chromo\">Ferry, Kathryn. \"Printing the Alhambra: Owen Jones and Chromolithography.\" ''Architectural History'' 46(2003): 175\u2013188.</ref> Although Senefelder recorded plans for chromolithography, printers in other countries, such as [[France]] and [[England]], were also trying to find a new way to print in color. [[Godefroy Engelmann]] of [[Mulhouse]] in France was awarded a patent on chromolithography in July 1837,<ref name=\"ferry_chromo\"/> but there are disputes over whether chromolithography was already in use before this date, as some sources say, pointing to areas of printing such as the production of [[playing card]]s.<ref name=\"ferry_chromo\"/>\n\n==Offset press (1870s)==\n{{Main|Offset press}}\nOffset printing is a widely used [[printing]] technique where the inked image is transferred (or \"offset\") from a plate to a rubber blanket, then to the printing surface. When used in combination with the [[Lithography|lithographic]] process, which is based on the repulsion of oil and water, the offset technique employs a flat (planographic) image carrier on which the image to be printed obtains [[ink]] from ink rollers, while the non-printing area attracts a film of water, keeping the non-printing areas ink-free.\n\n==Screenprinting (1907)==\n{{Main|Screenprinting}}\nScreenprinting has its origins in simple [[stencil]]ling, most notably of the [[Japanese art|Japanese]] form ([[katazome]]), used who cut banana leaves and inserted ink through the design holes on textiles, mostly for clothing. This was taken up in France. The modern screenprinting process originated from patents taken out by Samuel Simon in 1907 in [[England]]. This idea was then adopted in [[San Francisco, California]], by John Pilsworth in 1914 who used screenprinting to form multicolor [[Printmaking|prints]] in a subtractive mode, differing from screenprinting as it is done today.\n\n==Flexography==\n{{Main|Flexography}}\n[[File:Flexography-Platecloseup.JPG|thumb|right|A flexographic printing plate.]]\nFlexography (also called \"surface printing\"), often abbreviated to \"flexo\", is a method of [[printing]] most commonly used for packaging (labels, tape, bags, boxes, banners, and so on).\n\nA flexo print is achieved by creating a mirrored master of the required image as a [[Three-dimensional space|3D]] [[relief]] in a [[rubber]] or [[polymer]] material.  A measured amount of [[ink]] is deposited upon the surface of the printing plate (or printing cylinder) using an [[anilox]] roll. The print surface then rotates, contacting the print material which transfers the ink.\n\nOriginally flexo printing was basic in quality. Labels requiring high quality have generally been printed by offset printing until recently. Great advances have been made to the quality of flexo printing presses.\n\nThe greatest advances though have been in the area of photopolymer printing plates, including improvements to the plate material and the method of plate creation. Usually, [[photography|photographic]] exposure followed by chemical etch or water washout. Direct [[laser engraving]] of an ablative surface allows direct-to-plate exposure of photopolymer plates.\n\n==Dot matrix printer (1968)==\n{{Main|Dot matrix printing}}\nA dot matrix printer or impact matrix printer is a type of [[computer printer]] with a print head that runs back and forth on the page and prints by impact, striking an ink-soaked cloth ribbon against the paper, much like a [[typewriter]]. Unlike a typewriter or [[daisy wheel printer]], letters are drawn out of a [[dot matrix]], and thus, varied fonts and arbitrary graphics can be produced.  Because the printing involves mechanical pressure, these printers can create [[Carbon copy|carbon copies]] and [[Carbonless copy paper|carbonless copies]].\n\nEach dot is produced by a tiny metal rod, also called a \"wire\" or \"pin\", which is driven forward by  the power of a tiny [[electromagnet]] or [[solenoid]], either directly or through small levers (pawls). Facing the ribbon and the paper is a small guide plate (often made of an artificial jewel such as [[sapphire]] or [[ruby]] [http://www.freepatentsonline.com/4194846.html]) pierced with holes to serve as guides for the pins. The moving portion of the printer is called the print head, and when running the printer as a generic text device generally prints one line of text at a time. Most dot matrix printers have a single vertical line of dot-making equipment on their print heads; others have a few interleaved rows in order to improve dot density.\n\nThe first dot-matrix [[Printer (computing)|printers]] were invented in Japan.<ref name=\"kent\">Allen Kent, James G.

It is often cited as \"taking up a whole room,\" implying that it was a primitive version of the later familiar device used with a [[personal computer]]. While large, it was designed for an entirely different purpose. Many 3800s are still in use.\n\nThe first laser printer designed for use with an individual computer was released with the [[Xerox Star]] 8010 in 1981. Although it was innovative, the Star was an expensive ($17,000) system that was only purchased by a small number of laboratories and institutions. After [[personal computer]]s became more widespread, the first laser printer intended for a mass market was the [[Hewlett-Packard|HP]] [[LaserJet]] 8ppm, released in 1984, using a [[Canon (company)|Canon]] engine controlled by HP software. The HP LaserJet printer was quickly followed by other laser printers from [[Brother Industries]], IBM, and others.\n\nMost noteworthy was the role the laser printer played in popularizing [[desktop publishing]] with the introduction of the [[Apple Computer|Apple]] [[LaserWriter]] for the Apple [[Macintosh]], along with [[Adobe PageMaker|Aldus PageMaker]] software, in 1985. With these products, users could create documents that would previously have required professional [[typesetting]].\n\n==Inkjet printer==\n{{Main|Inkjet printer}}\nInkjet printers are a type of [[computer printer]] that operates by propelling tiny droplets of liquid [[ink]] onto paper.\n\n==Dye-sublimation printer==\n{{Main|Dye-sublimation printer}}\nA dye-sublimation printer (or dye-sub printer) is a [[computer printer]] which employs a printing process that uses heat to transfer dye to a medium such as a plastic card, printer paper or poster paper.  The process is usually to lay one color at a time using a ribbon that has color panels. Most dye-sublimation printers use CMYO colors which differs from the more recognised [[CMYK]] colors in that the black dye is eliminated in favour of a clear overcoating. This overcoating (which has numerous names depending on the manufacturer) is effectively a thin laminate which protects the print from discoloration from UV light and the air while also rendering the print water-resistant. Many [[consumer]] and [[professional]] dye-sublimation printers are designed and used for producing [[photograph]]ic prints.\n\n==Digital press (1993)==\n{{Main|Digital printing}}\n\nDigital printing is the reproduction of [[digital images]] on a physical surface, such as [[paper|common]] or [[photographic paper]] or paperboard-cover stock, [[photographic film|film]], [[cloth]], [[plastic]], [[Polyvinyl chloride|vinyl]], [[magnets]], [[labels]] etc.\n\nIt can be differentiated from [[Lithograph|litho]], [[flexography]], [[gravure]] or [[letterpress]] printing in many ways, some of which are;\n* Every impression made onto the paper can be different, as opposed to making several hundred or thousand impressions of the same image from one set of printing plates, as in traditional methods.\n* The [[Ink]] or [[Toner]] does not absorb into the substrate, as does conventional ink, but forms a layer on the surface and may be fused to the substrate by using an inline fuser fluid with heat process (toner) or UV curing process (ink).\n* It generally requires less waste in terms of chemicals used and paper wasted in set up or makeready (bringing the image \"up to color\" and checking position).\n* It is excellent for rapid prototyping, or small print runs which means that it is more accessible to a wider range of designers and more cost effective in short runs.\n\n==Frescography (1998)==\n[[File:Comersee Spalier rgb.jpg|thumb|300px|With CAM-program created Frescography]]   \n[[File:Frescography.jpg|thumb|left|Screenshot of a CAM program for designing frescographies.]]{{Main|Frescography}}   \n'''Frescography''' is a method for reproduction/creation of [[mural]]s using [[digital printing]] methods, invented in 1998 by [[Rainer Maria Latzke]], and patented in 2000. The frescography is based on digitally cut-out motifs which are stored in a [[database]]. [[Computer aided mural|CAM]] software programs then allow to enter the measurements of a wall or ceiling to create a mural design with [[low resolution]] motifs. Since architectural elements such as beams, windows or doors can be integrated, the design will result in an accurately and tailor-fit wall [[mural]]. Once a design is finished, the [[low resolution]] motifs are converted into the original [[high resolution]] images and are printed on canvas by [[Wide-format printer]]s. The canvas then can be applied to the wall in a [[wall-paper]]hanging like procedure and will then look like on-site created mural.\n\n==3D printing==\n{{Main|3D printing}}\nThree-dimensional printing is a method of converting a virtual [[3D model]] into a physical object. 3D printing is a category of [[rapid prototyping]] technology. 3D printers typically work by 'printing' successive layers on top of the previous to build up a three dimensional object. 3D printers are generally faster, more affordable and easier to use than other additive fabrication technologies.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.ptonline.com/articles/200408cu3.html |title=Close-Up On Technology - 3D Printers Lead Growth of Rapid Prototyping - 08/04<!-- Bot generated title --> |access-date=2007-09-24 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100123144538/http://www.ptonline.com/articles/200408cu3.html |archive-date=2010-01-23 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\n==Technological developments==\n\n===Woodcut===\n{{main|Woodcut}}\nWoodcut is a [[relief printing]] artistic technique in printmaking in which an image is carved into the surface of a block of wood, with the printing parts remaining level with the surface while the non-printing parts are removed, typically with gouges. The areas to show 'white' are cut away with a knife or chisel, leaving the characters or image to show in 'black' at the original surface level. The block is cut along the grain of the wood (unlike [[wood engraving]] where the block is cut in the end-grain). In Europe [[beech]]wood was most commonly used; in Japan, a special type of [[cherry]] wood was popular.\n\nWoodcut first appeared in ancient China. From 6th century onward, woodcut icons became popular and especially flourished in [[Chinese Buddhism]]. Since the 10th century, woodcut pictures appeared as illustrations in Chinese books, on [[banknote]]s such as [[Jiaozi (currency)]], and as single sheet images. Woodcut [[New Year picture]]s are also very popular with the Chinese.\n\nIn China and Tibet printed images mostly remained tied as illustrations to accompanying text until the modern period. The earliest woodblock printed book, the [[Diamond Sutra]] contains a large image as frontispiece, and many Buddhist texts contain some images. Later some notable Chinese artists designed woodcuts for books, the individual print develop in China in the form of [[New Year picture]] as an art-form in the way it did in Europe and Japan.\n\nIn Europe, woodcut is the oldest technique used for [[old master print]]s, developing about 1400, by using on paper existing techniques for printing on cloth. The explosion of sales of cheap woodcuts in the middle of the century led to a fall in standards, and many [[popular prints]] were very crude. The development of [[hatching]] followed on rather later than in [[engraving]]. [[Michael Wolgemut]] was significant in making German woodcut more sophisticated from about 1475, and [[Erhard Reuwich]] was the first to use cross-hatching (far harder to do than in engraving or [[etching]]). Both of these produced mainly book-illustrations, as did various Italian artists who were also raising standards there at the same period. At the end of the century [[Albrecht D\u00fcrer]] brought the Western woodcut to a level that has never been surpassed, and greatly increased the status of the ''single-leaf'' (i.e. an image sold separately) woodcut.\n\n===Engraving===\n{{Main|Engraving}}\nEngraving is the practice of incising a design onto a hard, flat surface, by cutting grooves into it. The result may be a decorated object in itself, as when [[silver]], [[gold]] or [[steel]] are engraved, or may provide an [[intaglio (printmaking)|intaglio]] printing plate, of [[copper]] or another metal, for printing images on paper, which are called engravings. Engraving was a historically important method of producing images on paper, both in artistic [[printmaking]], and also for commercial reproductions and illustrations for books and magazines. It has long been replaced by [[photography]] in its commercial applications and, partly because of the difficulty of learning the technique, is much less common in printmaking, where it has been largely replaced by [[etching]] and other techniques. Other terms often used for engravings are ''copper-plate engraving'' and ''[[Line engraving]]''. These should all mean exactly the same, but especially in the past were often used very loosely to cover several printmaking techniques, so that many so-called engravings were in fact produced by totally different techniques, such as etching.\n\nIn [[Ancient history|antiquity]], the only engraving that could be carried out is evident in the shallow grooves found in some jewellery after the beginning of the 1st Millennium B.C. The majority of so-called engraved designs on ancient gold rings or other items were produced by [[chasing (metalworking)|chasing]] or sometimes a combination of [[lost-wax casting]] and chasing.\n\nIn the European Middle Ages goldsmiths used engraving to decorate and inscribe metalwork. It is thought that they began to print impressions of their designs to record them. From this grew the engraving of copper printing plates to produce artistic images on paper, known as [[old master print]]s in Germany in the 1430s. Italy soon followed. Many early engravers came from a goldsmithing background. The first and greatest period of the engraving was from about 1470 to 1530, with such masters as [[Martin Schongauer]], [[Albrecht D\u00fcrer]], and [[Lucas van Leiden]].\n\n===Etching===\n{{Main|Etching}}\nEtching is the process of using strong acid or mordant to cut into the unprotected parts of a metal surface to create a design in intaglio in the metal (the original process\u2014in modern manufacturing other chemicals may be used on other types of material). As an intaglio method of printmaking it is, along with engraving, the most important technique for [[old master print]]s, and remains widely used today.\n\n===Halftoning===\n{{Main|Halftone}}\nHalftone is the [[reprographic]] technique that simulates ones it is [[continuous tone]] imagery through the use of equally spaced dots of varying size.<ref name=\"campbell\">Campbell, Alastair. The Designer's Lexicon. \u00a92000 Chronicle, San Francisco.</ref> 'Halftone' can also be used to refer specifically to the image that is produced by this process.<ref name=\"campbell\"/>\n\nThe idea of halftone printing originates from [[William Fox Talbot]]. In the early 1850s he suggested using \"photographic screens or veils\" in connection with a photographic [[intaglio (printmaking)|intaglio]] process.<ref name=twyman1970>Twyman, Michael. Eyre & Spottiswoode, London 1970.</ref>\n\nSeveral different kinds of screens were proposed during the following decades, but the first half-tone photo-engraving process was invented by Canadians George-\u00c9douard Desbarats and William Leggo Jr.<ref>{{cite DCB |last=Galarneau |first=Claude |title=Desbarats, George-\u00c9douard-Amable |volume=12 |url=http://www.biographi.ca/en/bio/desbarats_george_edouard_12E.html}}</ref> On October 30, 1869, Desbarats published the ''Canadian Illustrated News'' which became the world's first periodical to successfully employ this photo-mechanical technique; featuring a full page half-tone image of His Royal Highness Prince Arthur, from a photograph by Notman.[https://web.archive.org/web/20080523101009/http://www.collectionscanada.gc.ca/cin/026019-119.01-e.php] Ambitious to exploit a much larger circulation, Debarats and Leggo went to New York and launched the ''New York Daily Graphic'' in March 1873, which became the world's first illustrated daily.\n\nThe first truly successful commercial method was patented by [[Frederic Eugene Ives|Frederic Ives]] of [[Philadelphia]] in 1881.<ref name=\"twyman1970\"/><ref>Meggs (1998), 141.</ref> But although he found a way of breaking up the image into dots of varying sizes he did not make use of a screen. In 1882 the German [[George Meisenbach]] patented a halftone process in England. His invention was based on the previous ideas of Berchtold and Swan. He used single lined screens which were turned during exposure to produce cross-lined effects. He was the first to achieve  any commercial success with [[relief print|relief]] halftones.<ref name=twyman1970/>\n\n===Xerography===\n{{Main|Xerography}}\nXerography (or electrophotography) is a [[photocopying]] technique developed by [[Chester Carlson]] in 1938 and [[patent]]ed on October 6, 1942. He received {{US patent|2297691}} for his [[invention]]. The name xerography came from the Greek radicals ''xeros'' (dry) and ''graphos'' (writing), because there are no liquid chemicals involved in the process, unlike earlier reproduction techniques like [[cyanotype]].\n\nIn 1938 [[Bulgaria]]n [[physicist]] [[Georgi Nadjakov]] found that when placed into electric field and exposed to light, some dielectrics acquire permanent electric polarization in the exposed areas.[https://web.archive.org/web/20071101024139/http://www.issp.bas.bg/lab/ephi/Museum/acad_GNadjakov/GN11-page5.html] That polarization persists in the dark and is destroyed in light.\n[[Chester Carlson]], the inventor of photocopying, was originally a [[patent attorney]] and part-time researcher and inventor. His job at the patent office in [[New York City]] required him to make a large number of copies of important papers. Carlson, who was [[arthritis|arthritic]], found this a painful and tedious process. This prompted him to conduct experiments with [[photoconductivity]]. Carlson experimented with \"[[electrophotography]]\" in his kitchen and in 1938, applied for a patent for the process. He made the first \"photocopy\" using a [[zinc]] plate covered with [[sulfur]]. The words \"10-22-38 Astoria\" were written on a [[microscope]] slide, which was placed on top of more sulfur and under a bright light. After the slide was removed, a mirror image of the words remained. Carlson tried to sell his invention to some companies, but because the process was still underdeveloped he failed. At the time multiple copies were made using carbon paper or duplicating machines and people did not feel the need for an electronic machine. Between 1939 and 1944, Carlson was turned down by over 20 companies, including [[IBM]] and [[General Electric|GE]], neither of which believed there was a significant market for copiers.{{Citation needed|date=December 2008}}\n\n==See also==\n*[[History of the alphabet]]\n*[[History of writing]]\n*[[History of paper]]\n*[[Phaistos disc]] (a stamping technology considered by some researchers to be a precursor of printing)\n*[[History of graphic design]]\n*[[Publishing]]\n*[[Global spread of the printing press]]\n* [[History of books]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n*{{citation|last=Barrett|first=Timothy Hugh|title=The Woman Who Discovered Printing|year=2008|publisher=[[Yale University Press]]|location=Great Britain|isbn=978-0-300-12728-7}} (alk. paper)\n*{{citation|last=Chia|first=Lucille|year=2011|title=Knowledge and Text Production in an Age of Print: China, 900-1400|publisher=Brill}}\n*{{citation|last=Tsien|first=Tsuen-Hsuin|authorlink=Tsien Tsuen-hsuin|title=Paper and Printing|volume=vol. 5 part 1|series=Needham, Joseph ''Science and Civilization in China:''|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=1985|ISBN= 0-521-08690-6}}\n*{{citation|last=Twitchett|first=Denis|title=The Cambridge History of China Volume 8 The Ming Dynasty, 1368\u20141644, Part 2|year=1998b|publisher=Cambridge University Press}}\n*{{citation|last=Wilkinson|first=Endymion|year=2012|title=Chinese History: A New Manual|publisher=Harvard University Asia Center for the Harvard-Yenching Institute}}\n*{{citation|last=McMurtrie|first=Douglas C.|year=1962|title=THE BOOK: The Story of Printing & Bookmaking|publisher=Oxford University Press, seventh edition}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:History Of Printing}}\n[[Category:History of printing| ]]\n[[Category:History of writing|Printing]]\n[[Category:Textual scholarship]]\n[[Category:History of science by discipline|Printing]]\n", "text_old": "{{short description|History of printing on paper}}\n{{History of printing}}\n\nThe '''history of printing''' starts as early as 3500 BC, when the Persian and Mesopotamian civilizations used [[cylinder seal]]s to certify documents written in clay. Other early forms include block seals, pottery imprints and cloth printing. [[Woodblock printing]] on paper originated in China around 200 AD. It led to the development of [[movable type]] in the eleventh century and the spread of book production in East Asia. Woodblock printing was also used in Europe, but it was in the fifteenth century that European printers developed a process for mass-producing metal type to support an economical book publishing industry. This industry enabled the communication of ideas and sharing of knowledge on an unprecedented scale. Alongside the development of text printing, new and lower-cost methods of image reproduction were developed, including [[lithography]], [[screen printing]] and [[photocopying]].\n\n==Stencil==\n[[File:SantaCruz-CuevaManos-P2210651b.jpg|thumb|Hands at the ''Cuevas de las Manos'' upon ''R\u00edo Pinturas'', near the town of Perito Moreno in [[:en:Santa Cruz Province (Argentina)|Santa Cruz Province]], [[Argentina]].]]\n{{Main|Stencil}}\n[[Hand stencils]], made by blowing pigment over a hand held against a wall, have been found in Asia and Europe dating from over 35,000 years ago, and later prehistoric dates in other continents.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Ghosh|first1=Pallab|title=Cave paintings change ideas about the origin of art|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-29415716|website=BBC News|publisher=BBC News}} \"The minimum age for (the outline of the hand) is 39,900 years old, which makes it the oldest hand stencil in the world,\" said Dr Aubert. \"Next to it is , and this is one of the oldest figurative depictions in the world, if not the oldest one,\" he told BBC News.

In the [[Western Zhou]], sets of seal stamps were encased in blocks of type and used on clay moulds for casting bronzes. By the end of the 3rd century BC seals were also used for printing on pottery. In the Northern dynasties textual sources contain references to wooden seals with up to 120 characters.{{sfn|Wilkinson|2012|p=909}}\n\nThe seals had a religious element to them. [[Daoists]] used seals as healing devices by impressing therapeutic characters onto the flesh of sick people. They were also used to stamp food, creating a talismanic character to ward off disease. The first evidence of these practices appeared under a Buddhist context in the mid 5th century. Centuries later seals were used to create hundreds of Buddha images.{{sfn|Wilkinson|2012|p=909}}\n\n== Stone and bronze blocks ==\nStone and bronze blocks have been used to print fabric.

It became widely used throughout [[East Asia]] both as a method for printing on [[textile]]s and later, under the influence of [[Buddhism]], on [[paper]]. As a method of printing on cloth, the earliest surviving examples from [[China]] date to about 220. ''[[Ukiyo-e]]'' is the best known type of [[Japan]]ese woodblock art print. Most European uses of the technique on paper are covered by the term [[woodcut]] (see below), except for the [[woodblock printing#Block-books in fifteenth century Europe|block-books]] produced mainly in the fifteenth century.<ref>{{cite web|title=History of Printing Timeline|url=https://printinghistory.org/timeline/|website=American Printing History Association: To Encourage the Study of Printing History|accessdate=22 December 2015}}</ref>\n\n===Legendary origins===\nAccording to southern Chinese histories, in the 480s, a man named Gong Xuanxuan styled himself Gong the Sage and 'said that a supernatural being had given him a \"jade seal jade block writing,\" which did not require a brush: one blew on the paper and characters formed.'{{sfn|Barrett|2008|p=60}} He then used his powers to mystify a local governor. Eventually he was dealt with by the governor's successor, who presumably executed Gong.{{sfn|Barrett|2008|p=50}} Timothy Hugh Barrett postulates that Gong's magical jade block was actually a printing device, and Gong was one of the first, if not the first printer. The semi-mythical record of him therefore describes his usage of the printing process to deliberately bewilder onlookers and create an image of mysticism around himself.{{sfn|Barrett|2008|p=61}}\n\n===In the Sinosphere===\n{{Main|History of printing in East Asia}}\n\nThe rise of printing was greatly influenced by [[Mahayana Buddhism]]. According to Mahayana beliefs, religious texts hold intrinsic value for carrying the Buddha's word and act as talismanic objects containing sacred power capable of warding off evil spirits. By copying and preserving these texts, Buddhists could accrue personal merit. As a consequence the idea of printing and its advantages in replicating texts quickly became apparent to Buddhists, who by the 7th century, were using woodblocks to create apotropaic documents. These Buddhist texts were printed specifically as ritual items and were not widely circulated or meant for public consumption. Instead they were buried in consecrated ground. The earliest extant example of this type of printed matter is a fragment of a dh\u0101ra\u1e47\u012b (Buddhist spell) miniature scroll written in Sanskrit unearthed in a tomb in [[Xi'an]]. It is called the ''Great spell of unsullied pure light'' (''Wugou jingguang da tuoluoni jing'' \u7121\u57a2\u6de8\u5149\u5927\u9640\u7f85\u5c3c\u7d93) and was printed using woodblock during the Tang dynasty, c. 650-670.{{sfn|Wilkinson|2012|p=910}} A similar piece, the ''Saddharma pundarika'' sutra, was also discovered and dated to 690 to 699.<ref name=\"pan 1997 179 180\">{{cite journal |last=Pan |first=Jixing |title=On the Origin of Printing in the Light of New Archaeological Discoveries |journal=Chinese Science Bulletin |year=1997 |volume=42 |issue=12 |pages=976\u2013981 [pp. 979\u2013980] |issn=1001-6538 |doi=10.1007/BF02882611 }}</ref> This coincides with the reign of [[Wu Zetian]], under which the [[Longer Sukh\u0101vat\u012bvy\u016bha S\u016btra]], which advocates the practice of printing apotropaic and merit making texts and images, was translated by Chinese monks.{{sfn|Wilkinson|2012|p=910}}\n\nEvidence of woodblock printing appeared in Korea and Japan soon afterward.

The request was granted in 991 when Seongjong's official Han Eongong visited the Song court.<ref>https://digital.lib.washington.edu/researchworks/bitstream/handle/1773/24231/Hyun_washington_0250E_12384.pdf?sequence=1 p. 191.</ref> In 1011, [[Hyeonjong of Goryeo]] issued the carving of their own set of the Buddhist canon, which would come to be known as the ''[[Goryeo Daejanggyeong]]''. The project was suspended in 1031 after Heyongjong's death, but work resumed again in 1046 after [[Munjong of Goryeo|Munjong]]'s accession to the throne. The completed work, amounting to some 6,000 volumes, was finished in 1087. Unfortunately the original set of woodblocks was destroyed in a conflagration during the [[Mongol invasions of Korea|Mongol invasion]] of 1232. King [[Gojong of Goryeo|Gojong]] ordered another set to be created and work began in 1237, this time only taking 12 years to complete. In 1248 the complete ''[[Goryeo Daejanggyeong]]'' numbered 81,258 printing blocks, 52,330,152 characters, 1496 titles, and 6568 volumes. Due to the stringent editing process that went into the ''Goryeo Daejanggyeong'' and its surprisingly enduring nature, having survived completely intact over 760 years, it is considered the most accurate of Buddhist canons written in [[Classical Chinese]] as well as a standard edition for East Asian Buddhist scholarship.<ref name=\"Memory\">{{cite web|title=Printing woodblocks of the Tripitaka Koreana and miscellaneous Buddhist scriptures|url=http://www.unesco.org/new/en/communication-and-information/memory-of-the-world/register/full-list-of-registered-heritage/registered-heritage-page-7/printing-woodblocks-of-the-tripitaka-koreana-and-miscellaneous-buddhist-scriptures/|website=UNESCO Memory of the World|publisher=United Nations|accessdate=30 July 2016}}</ref>\n\n====Impact of woodblock printing====\nPrior to the introduction of printing, the size of private collections in China had already seen an increase since the invention of paper. Fan Ping (215-84) had in his collection 7,000 rolls (''juan''), or a few hundred titles. Two centuries later, Zhang Mian owned 10,000 ''juan'', [[Shen Yue]] (441-513) 20,000 ''juan'', and [[Xiao Tong]] and his cousin Xiao Mai both had collections of 30,000 ''juan''. [[Emperor Yuan of Liang]] (508-555) was said to have had a collection of 80,000 ''juan''. The combined total of all known private book collectors prior to the Song dynasty number around 200, with the Tang alone accounting for 60 of them.{{sfn|Wilkinson|2012|p=930}}\n\nFollowing the maturation of woodblock printing, official, commercial, and private publishing businesses emerged while the size and number of collections grew exponentially. The Song dynasty alone accounts for some 700 known private collections, more than triple the number of all the preceding centuries combined. Private libraries of 10-20,000 ''juan'' became commonplace while six individuals owned collections of over 30,000 ''juan''. The earliest extant private Song library catalogue lists 1,937 titles in 24,501 ''juan''. Zhou Mi's collection numbered 42,000 ''juan'', Chen Zhensun's collection lists 3,096 titles in 51,180 ''juan'', and [[Ye Mengde]] (1077-1148) as well as one other individual owned libraries of 6,000 titles in 100,000 ''juan''. The majority of which were secular in nature. Texts contained material such as medicinal instruction or came in the form of a ''[[leishu]]'' (\u985e\u66f8), a type of encyclopedic reference book used to help [[imperial examinations|examination]] candidates.{{sfn|Wilkinson|2012|p=910}}{{sfn|Wilkinson|2012|p=930}}\n\nImperial establishments such as the Three Institutes: Zhaowen Institute, History Institute, and Jixian Institute also followed suit. At the start of the dynasty the Three Institutes' holdings numbered 13,000 ''juan'', by the year 1023 39,142 ''juan'', by 1068 47,588 ''juan'', and by 1127 73,877 ''juan''. The Three Institutes were one of several imperial libraries, with eight other major palace libraries, not including imperial academies.{{sfn|Chia|2011|p=43}} According to Weng Tongwen, by the 11th century, central government offices were saving tenfold by substituting earlier manuscripts with printed versions.{{sfn|Chia|2011|p=21}} The impact of woodblock printing on Song society is illustrated in the following exchange between [[Emperor Zhenzong]] and Xing Bing in the year 1005:\n\n{{quotation|The emperor went to the Directorate of Education to inspect the Publications Office. He asked Xing Bing how many woodblocks were kept there. Bing replied, \"At the start of our dynasty, there were fewer than four thousand. Today, there are more than one hundred thousand. The classics and histories, together with standard commentaries, are all fully represented. When I was young and devoted myself to learning, there were only one or two scholars in every hundred who possessed copies of all the classics and commentaries. There was no way to copy so many works. Today, printed editions of these works are abundant, and officials and commoners alike have them in their homes. Scholars are fortunate indeed to have been born in such an era as ours!{{sfn|Chia|2011|p=33}}}}\n\nIn 1076, the 39 year old [[Su Shi]] remarked upon the unforeseen effect an abundance of books had on examination candidates:\n\n{{quotation|I can recall meeting older scholars, long ago, who said that when they were young they had a hard time getting their hands on a copy of ''Shiji'' or ''Han shu''. If they were lucky enough to get one, they thought nothing of copying the entire text out by hand, so they could recite it day and night. In recent years merchants engrave and print all manner of books belonging to the hundred schools, and produce ten thousand pages a day. With books so readily available, you would think that students' writing and scholarship would be many times better than what they were in earlier generations. Yet, to the contrary, young men and examination candidates leave their books tied shut and never look at them, preferring to amuse themselves with baseless chatter. Why is this?{{sfn|Chia|2011|p=38}}}}\n\nWoodblock printing also changed the shape and structure of books. Scrolls were gradually replaced by concertina binding (\u7d93\u647a\u88dd) from the Tang period onward. The advantage was that it was now possible to flip to a reference without unfolding the entire document. The next development known as whirlwind binding (''xuanfeng zhuang'' \u65cb\u98a8\u88dd) was to secure the first and last leaves to a single large sheet, so that the book could be opened like an accordion.{{sfn|Wilkinson|2012|p=912}}\n\nAround the year 1000, butterfly binding was developed. Woodblock prints allowed two mirror images to be easily replicated on a single sheet. Thus two pages were printed on a sheet, which was then folded inwards. The sheets were then pasted together at the fold to make a [[codex]] with alternate openings of printed and blank pairs of pages. In the 14th century the folding was reversed outwards to give continuous printed pages, each backed by a blank hidden page. Later the sewn bindings were preferred rather than pasted bindings.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://idp.bl.uk/IDP/bookbinding/CONCERTINA-FRAMESET.html |title=Dunhuang concertina binding findings |accessdate=2000-03-09 |url-status=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20000309034110/http://idp.bl.uk/IDP/bookbinding/CONCERTINA-FRAMESET.html |archivedate=2000-03-09 }}</ref> Only relatively small volumes (''[[:wiktionary:\u83e4|juan \u5377]]'') were bound up, and several of these would be enclosed in a cover called a ''tao'', with wooden boards at front and back, and loops and pegs to close up the book when not in use.

Indeed, manuscripts remained dominant until the very end of Imperial China:\n\n{{quotation|As a result of block-printing technology, it became easier and cheaper to produce multiple copies of books quickly. By the eleventh century, the price of books had fallen by about one tenth what they had been before and as a result they were more widely disseminated. Nevertheless, even in the fifteenth century most books in major libraries were still in manuscript, not in print. Almost to the end of the empire it remained cheaper to pay a copyist than to buy a printed book. Seven hundred and fifty years after the first imperially sponsored printed works in the Northern Song, the greatest book project of the eighteenth century, the ''[[Siku quanshu]]'' \u56db\u5eab\u5168\u66f8, was produced as a manuscript, not as a printed collection. About 4 percent of it was printed in movable type in 1773, but it was hand-carved movable wooden type. Indeed, the entire collection was only printed for the first time in the 1980s. Access to books, especially large works, such as the ''Histories'', remained difficult right into the twentieth century.{{sfn|Wilkinson|2012|p=910-911}}|Endymion Wilkinson}}\n\nNot only did manuscripts remain competitive with imprints,<ref>In late Ming/early Qing China, cost for copying 20 to 30 pages was around .02 to .03 tael, which worked out to something like 0.005 tael per hundred characters, while a carver was typically paid .0.02 to 0.03 tael per hundred characters carved, and could carve 100 to 150 characters a day. \"Publishing, Culture, and Power in Early Modern China\", Kai-Wing Chow, 2004, Stanford University Press, page 36</ref> they were even ''preferred'' by elite scholars and collectors. The age of printing gave the act of copying by hand a new dimension of cultural reverence. Those who considered themselves real scholars and true connoisseurs of the book did not consider imprints to be real books. Under the elitist attitudes of the time, \"printed books were for those who did not truly care about books.\"{{sfn|Chia|2011|p=41}}\n\nHowever, copyists and manuscript only continued to remain competitive with printed editions by dramatically reducing their price. According to the [[Ming dynasty]] author [[Hu Yinglin]], \"if no printed edition were available on the market, the hand-copied manuscript of a book would cost ten times as much as the printed work,\"{{sfn|Tsien|1985|p=373}} also \"once a printed edition appeared, the transcribed copy could no longer be sold and would be discarded.\"{{sfn|Tsien|1985|p=373}} The result is that despite the mutual co-existence of hand-copied manuscripts and printed texts, the cost of the book had declined by about 90 percent by the end of the 16th century.{{sfn|Tsien|1985|p=373}} As a result, literacy increased. In 1488, the [[Koreans|Korean]] [[Choe Bu]] observed during his trip to China that \"even village children, ferrymen, and sailors\" could read, although this applied mainly to the south while northern China remained largely illiterate.{{sfn|Twitchett|1998b|p=636}}\n\n===In India===\n\nIn Buddhism, great merit is thought to accrue from copying and preserving texts. The 4th-century{{Fix|text=which?}} master{{Fix|text=who?}} listed the copying of scripture as the first of ten essential religious practices. The importance of perpetuating texts is set out with special force in the [[Infinite Life Sutra|longer Sukh\u0101vat\u012bvy\u016bha S\u016btra]], which urges the devout not only to hear, learn, remember and study the text but to obtain a good copy and to preserve it. This \"cult of the book\" led to techniques for reproducing texts in great numbers, especially the short prayers or charms known as ''dh\u0101ra\u1e47\u012bs''.

Images printed on cloth for religious purposes could be quite large and elaborate, and when [[paper]] became relatively easily available, around 1400, the medium transferred very quickly to small [[woodcut]] religious images and [[playing cards]] printed on paper.

Even in Korea where metal movable type was most widespread, it still never replaced woodblock printing. Indeed, even the promulgation of [[Hangeul]] was done through woodblock prints. The general assumption is that movable type did not replace block printing in places that used Chinese characters due to the expense of producing more than 200,000 individual pieces of type. Even woodblock printing was not as cost productive as simply paying a copyist to write out a book by hand if there was no intention of producing more than a few copies. Although [[Sejong the Great]] introduced Hangeul, an alphabetic system, in the 15th century, Hangeul only replaced [[Hanja]] in the 20th century.{{sfn|Wilkinson|2012|p=911}} And unlike China, the movable type system was kept mainly within the confines of a highly stratified elite Korean society:\n\n{{quotation|Korean printing with movable metallic type developed mainly within the royal foundry of the Yi dynasty.

Printing of secular materials did not pick up until the late 16th century. The ''Setsuy\u014d-sh\u016b'', a two-volume Chinese-Japanese dictionary printed in 1591, was the first secular book to be printed in Japan. Only after [[Toyotomi Hideyoshi]]'s [[Japanese invasions of Korea (1592\u201398)|invasions of Korea]], which brought back artisans and printing equipment in 1593, did Japan acquire its own wooden type font. Under [[Emperor Go-Y\u014dzei]]'s orders, the [[Confucian]] ''[[Analects]]'' were printed using metal movable type in 1598. It is generally considered to be the earliest extant Japanese text printed using metal movable type. The popularity of movable type in Japan was short lived. By the 1640s woodblock printing had reasserted itself as the dominant mode of printing in Japan.<ref>Sansom, George (1961). \"A History of Japan: 1334-1615.\" Stanford, California: Stanford University Press.</ref>\n\n====Controversy====\nTraditionally it has been assumed that the prevalence of woodblock printing in East Asia as a result of Chinese characters led to the stagnation of printing culture and enterprise in that region. S. H. Steinberg describes woodblock printing in his ''Five Hundred Years of Printing'' as having \"outlived their usefulness\" and their printed material as \"cheap tracts for the half-literate, ... which anyway had to be very brief because of the laborious process of cutting the letters.\"{{sfn|Barrett|2008|p=10}} John Man's ''The Gutenberg Revolution'' makes a similar case: \"wood-blocks were even more demanding than manuscript pages to make, and they wore out and broke, and then you had to carve another one - a whole page at a time.\"{{sfn|Barrett|2008|p=10}}\n\nRecent commentaries on printing in China using contemporary European observers with first hand knowledge complicate the traditional narrative. T. H. Barrett points out that only Europeans who had never seen Chinese woodblock printing in action tended to dismiss it, perhaps due to the almost instantaneous arrival of both xylography and movable type in Europe. The early Jesuit missionaries of late 16th century China, for instance, had a similar distaste for wood based printing for very different reasons. These Jesuits found that \"the cheapness and omnipresence of printing in China made the prevailing wood-based technology extremely disturbing, even dangerous.\"{{sfn|Barrett|2008|p=11}} [[Matteo Ricci]] made note of \"the exceedingly large numbers of books in circulation here and the ridiculously low prices at which they are sold.\"{{sfn|Twitchett|1998b|p=637}} Two hundred years later the Englishman John Barrow, by way of the [[Macartney Embassy|Macartney mission]] to Qing China, also remarked with some amazement that the printing industry was \"as free as in England, and the profession of printing open to everyone.\"{{sfn|Barrett|2008|p=11}} The commercial success and profitability of woodblock printing was attested to by one British observer at the end of the nineteenth century, who noted that even before the arrival of western printing methods, the price of books and printed materials in [[History of China|China]] had already reached an astoundingly low price compared to what could be found in his home country. Of this, he said:\n\n{{quotation|We have an extensive penny literature at home, but the [[English people|English]] cottager cannot buy anything like the amount of printed matter for his penny that the [[Chinaman (term)|Chinaman]] can for even less.

Today, practically all movable type printing ultimately derives from Gutenberg's movable type printing, which is often regarded as the most important invention of the second millennium.<ref>In 1997, [[Time Life]] magazine picked Gutenberg's invention to be the most important of the second millennium.{{Citation needed|date=May 2019}} In 1999, the A&E Network voted Johannes Gutenberg \"Man of the Millennium\".{{Citation needed|date=May 2019}} See also [http://pirate.shu.edu/~gottlitr/mil_site/lista.html 1,000 Years, 1,000 People: Ranking The Men and Women Who Shaped The Millennium] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071012221307/http://pirate.shu.edu/~gottlitr/mil_site/lista.html |date=2007-10-12 }} which was composed by four prominent US journalists in 1998.</ref>\n\nGutenberg is also credited with the introduction of an oil-based ink which was more durable than previously used water-based inks. Having worked as a professional [[goldsmith]], Gutenberg made skillful use of his knowledge of metals. He was also the first to make his type from an [[alloy]] of lead, tin, and [[antimony]], known as [[type metal]], printer's lead, or printer's metal, which was critical for producing durable type that produced high-quality printed books, and proved to be more suitable for printing than the clay, wooden or bronze types used in East Asia. To create these lead types, Gutenberg used what some considered his most ingenious invention: a special matrix which enabled the moulding of new movable types with an unprecedented precision at short notice. Within a year of printing the Gutenberg Bible, Gutenberg also published the first coloured prints.\n\nThe invention of the printing press revolutionized communication and book production, leading to the spread of knowledge. Printing was rapidly spread from Germany by emigrating German printers, but also by foreign apprentices returning home. A printing press was built in [[Venice]] in 1469, and by 1500 the city had 417 printers. In 1470 [[Johann Heynlin]] set up a printing press in [[Paris]]. In 1473 [[Kasper Straube]] published the ''[[Almanach cracoviense ad annum 1474]]'' in [[Krak\u00f3w]]. [[Dirk Martens]] set up a printing press in [[Aalst, Belgium|Aalst]] ([[Flanders]]) in 1473. He printed a book about the two lovers of [[Enea Piccolomini]] who became [[Pope Pius II]]. In 1476 a printing press was set up in England by [[William Caxton]]. The Italian Juan Pablos set up an imported press in [[Mexico City]] in 1539. The first printing press in [[Southeast Asia]] was set up in the [[Philippines]] by the [[Spanish Empire|Spanish]] in 1593. The Rev. Jose Glover intended to bring the first printing press to England's American colonies in 1638, but died on the voyage, so his widow, Elizabeth Harris Glover, established the printing house, which was run by Stephen Day and became The Cambridge Press.<ref>Stowell, Marion B.

As a method of creating reproductions for mass consumption, the printing press has been superseded by the advent of [[offset printing]].\n\nJohannes Gutenberg's work in the printing press began in approximately 1436 when he partnered with Andreas Dritzehen\u2014a man he had previously instructed in gem-cutting\u2014and Andreas Heilmann, owner of a paper mill.<ref name=\"meggs58-69\"/> It was not until a 1439 [[lawsuit]] against Gutenberg that official record exists; witnesses testimony discussed type, an inventory of metals (including lead) and his type mold.<ref name=\"meggs58-69\"/>\n\nOthers in Europe were developing movable type at this time, including goldsmith Procopius Waldfoghel of France and [[Laurens Janszoon Coster]] of the [[Netherlands]].<ref name=\"meggs58-69\"/> They are not known to have contributed specific advances to the printing press.<ref name=\"meggs58-69\"/> While the [[Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica Eleventh Edition]] had attributed the invention of the printing press to Coster, the company now states that is incorrect.<ref name=\"britannica_web_coster\">''[http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-36788/typography Typography - Gutenberg and printing in Germany].''

Some master printing houses, like that of [[Aldus Manutius]], became the cultural center for [[Intellectual|literati]] such as [[Erasmus]].\n\n*Print shop apprentices: Apprentices, usually between the ages of 15 and 20, worked for master printers. Apprentices were not required to be literate, and literacy rates at the time were very low, in comparison to today. Apprentices prepared ink, dampened sheets of paper, and assisted at the press. An apprentice who wished to learn to become a compositor had to learn Latin and spend time under the supervision of a journeyman.\n*Journeyman printers: After completing their apprenticeships, ''journeyman''  printers were free to move employers. This facilitated the spread of printing to areas that were less print-centred.\n*Compositors: Those who set the type for printing.\n*Pressmen: the person who worked the press. This was physically labour-intensive.\n\nThe earliest-known image of a European, Gutenberg-style print shop is the ''Dance of Death'' by Matthias Huss, at Lyon, 1499. This image depicts a compositor standing at a compositor's case being grabbed by a skeleton. The case is raised to facilitate his work.  At the right of the printing house a bookshop is shown.\n\n====Financial aspects====\nAccording to court records from the city of Mainz, Johannes Fust was for some time Gutenberg's financial backer. By the 16th century jobs in printing were becoming increasingly specialized. Structures{{clarify|date=June 2017}} supporting publishers were more and more complex, leading to division of labour. In Europe between 1500 and 1700 the role of the Master Printer was dying out and giving way to the bookseller\u2014publisher. During this period, printing had a stronger commercial imperative than previously. Risks associated with the industry however were substantial, although dependent on the nature of the publication.\n\nBookseller publishers negotiated at trade fairs and at print shops. Jobbing work appeared: some printers performed menial tasks at the beginning of their careers to support themselves.\n\nFrom 150 to 1700 publishers developed several new methods of funding projects:\n\n# Cooperative associations/publication syndicates\u2014a number of individuals shared the risks associated with printing and shared in the profit. This was pioneered by the French.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}\n# Subscription publishing: pioneered by the English in the early 17th century.<ref>\"The Beginnings of Subscription Publication in the Seventeenth Century\", Sarah L. C. Clapp, ''Modern Philology''. Vol. 29 No. 2, 1931, pp. 199-224, University of Chicago Press</ref>  A prospectus for a publication was drawn up by a publisher to raise funding. The prospectus was given to potential buyers who signed up for a copy. If there were not enough subscriptions the publication did not go ahead. Lists of subscribers were included in the books as endorsements. If enough people subscribed, there might be a reprint. Some authors used subscription publication to bypass the publisher entirely.\n# Installment publishing: books were issued in parts until a complete book had been issued. This was not necessarily done within a fixed time period. It was an effective method of spreading the cost over a period of time. It also allowed earlier returns on investment to help cover the production costs of subsequent installments.\n\nThe ''Mechanick Exercises'', by Joseph Moxon, in London, 1683, was said to be the first publication in installments.<ref name=\"serial\">{{cite book |last1=Wiles |first1=R. M. |date= |year=2012 |title=Serial Publication in England Before 1750 |trans-title= |url=https://books.google.fr/books?id=SL2gM5RygKwC |access-date=|format= |language=English |location= |publisher=Cambridge University Press |page=79 |pages= |isbn= |via= |subscription= |quote= |trans-quote=}}</ref>\n\nPublishing trade organizations allowed publishers to organize business concerns collectively. These arrangements included systems of self-regulation. For example, if one publisher did something to irritate other publishers he would be controlled by peer pressure. Such systems are known as [[cartel]]s, and are in most countries now considered to be in restraint of trade. These arrangements helped deal with labour unrest among journeymen, who faced difficult working conditions. Brotherhoods predated unions, without the formal regulations now associated with unions.\n\nIn most cases, publishers bought the [[copyright]] in a work from the author, and made some arrangement about the possible profits. This required a substantial amount of capital in addition to that needed for the physical equipment and staff. Alternatively, an author with some capital available would sometimes keep the copyright himself, and simply pay the printer to print the book.\n\n====Rotary printing press====\n{{Main|Rotary printing press}}\nIn a rotary printing press, the impressions are carved around a cylinder so that the printing can be done on long continuous rolls of paper, [[Paperboard|cardboard]], [[plastic]], or a large number of other substrates. Rotary drum printing was invented by [[Richard March Hoe]] in 1843 and patented in 1847, and then significantly improved by [[William Bullock (inventor)|William Bullock]] in 1863.\n\n==Intaglio==\n[[File:Intaglio-printing.svg|thumb|right|Intaglio printing. The top line is the paper, to which a slightly raised layer of ink adheres; the matrix is beneath]]\n{{Main|Intaglio (printmaking)}}\nIntaglio ({{IPAc-en|\u026a|n|\u02c8|t|\u00e6|l|i|o\u028a}}) is a family of [[printmaking]] techniques in which the image is incised into a surface, known as the matrix or plate. Normally, [[copper]] or [[zinc]] plates are used as a surface, and the incisions are created by [[etching]], [[engraving]], [[drypoint]], [[aquatint]] or [[mezzotint]]. [[Collography|Collographs]] may also be printed as intaglio plates.  To print an intaglio plate the surface is covered in thick ink and then rubbed with [[tarlatan]] cloth to remove most of the excess. The final smooth wipe is usually done by hand, sometimes with the aid of newspaper or old public phone book pages, leaving ink only in the incisions. A damp piece of paper is placed on top and the plate and paper are run through a printing press that, through pressure, transfers the ink from the recesses of the plate to the paper.\n\n==Lithography (1796)==\n[[File:Litography press with map of Moosburg 02.jpg|thumb|left|Lithography press for printing maps in Munich.]][[File:Lithography stone Princeton motif.jpg|thumb|Stone used for a lithograph with a view of [[Princeton University]]\n(Collection: Princeton University Library, NJ)]]\n{{Main|Lithography}}\nInvented by Bavarian author [[Aloys Senefelder]] in 1796,<ref name=\"meggspage146\">Meggs, Philip B. A History of Graphic Design. \u00a91998 John Wiley & Sons, Inc. p 146 {{ISBN|0-471-29198-6}}</ref> '''lithography''' is a method for printing on a smooth surface. Lithography is a printing process that uses chemical processes to create an image. For instance, the positive part of an image would be a [[hydrophobic]] chemical, while the negative image would be water. Thus, when the plate is introduced to a compatible ink and water mixture, the ink will adhere to the positive image and the water will clean the negative image.  This allows for a relatively flat print plate which allows for much longer runs than the older physical methods of imaging (e.g., embossing or engraving).\nHigh-volume lithography is used today to produce posters, maps, books, newspapers, and packaging \u2014 just about any smooth, mass-produced item with print and graphics on it. Most books, indeed all types of high-volume text, are now printed using [[offset lithography]].\n\nIn offset lithography, which depends on photographic processes, flexible aluminum, polyester, mylar or paper printing plates are used in place of stone tablets. Modern printing plates have a brushed or roughened texture and are covered with a photosensitive [[emulsion]]. A photographic negative of the desired image is placed in contact with the emulsion and the plate is exposed to ultraviolet light. After development, the emulsion shows a reverse of the negative image, which is thus a duplicate of the original (positive) image. The image on the plate emulsion can also be created through direct laser imaging in a CTP ([[Computer to plate|Computer-To-Plate]]) device called a platesetter. The positive image is the emulsion that remains after imaging. For many years, chemicals have been used to remove the non-image emulsion, but now plates are available that do not require chemical processing.\n\n==Color printing==\n{{Main|Colour printing|Woodcut}}\n[[File:Uncle Sam Supplying the World with Berry Brothers Hard Oil Finish.jpg|thumb|right|Calvert Lithographic Company, Detroit, MI. ''Uncle Sam Supplying the World with Berry Brothers Hard Oil Finish,'' c. 1880. Noel Wisdom Chromolithograph Collection, Special Collections Department, The University of South Florida Tampa Library.]]\nAccording to Michael Sullivan, the earliest known example of color printing \"is a two-color frontispiece to a Buddhist sutra scroll, dated 1346\". Color printing continued to be used in China throughout the [[Ming Dynasty|Ming]] and [[Qing Dynasty]].<ref name=\"Sullivan\">{{cite book|author=Michael Sullivan|title=The Arts of China|url=https://archive.org/details/bub_gb_CzdICSqnELkC|edition=Third|date=18 June 1984|publisher=University of California Press|isbn=978-0-520-04918-5|page=[https://archive.org/details/bub_gb_CzdICSqnELkC/page/n222 203]}}</ref>\n\n[[Chromolithography]] became the most successful of several methods of [[colour printing]] developed by the 19th century; other methods were developed by printers such as [[Jacob Christoph Le Blon]], [[George Baxter (printer)|George Baxter]] and [[Edmund Evans]], and mostly relied on using several [[woodcut|woodblocks]] with the colors. Hand-coloring also remained important; elements of the official British [[Ordnance Survey]] maps were colored by hand by boys until 1875.  Chromolithography developed from lithography and the term covers various types of lithography that are printed in color.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://seeing.nypl.org/planographic.html|title=Planographic Printing|date=1999-10-23|accessdate=2014-11-21|publisher=The New York Public Library}}</ref> The initial technique involved the use of multiple lithographic stones, one for each color, and was still extremely expensive when done for the best quality results. Depending on the number of colors present, a chromolithograph could take months to produce, by very skilled workers.  However much cheaper prints could be produced by simplifying both the number of colors used, and the refinement of the detail in the image.  Cheaper images, like the advertisement illustrated, relied heavily on an initial black print (not always a lithograph), on which colors were then overprinted. To make an expensive reproduction print as what was once referred to as a \"\u2019chromo\u2019\", a lithographer, with a finished painting in front of him, gradually created and corrected the many stones using proofs to look as much as possible like the painting in front of him, sometimes using dozens of layers.<ref>Clapper, Michael. \"'I Was Once a Barefoot Boy!': Cultural Tensions in a Popular Chromo.\" American Art 16(2002): 16-39.</ref>\n\nAloys Senefelder, the inventor of lithography, introduced the subject of colored lithography in his 1818 ''Vollstaendiges Lehrbuch der Steindruckerey (A Complete Course of Lithography)'', where he told of his plans to print using color and explained the colors he wished to be able to print someday.<ref name=\"ferry_chromo\">Ferry, Kathryn. \"Printing the Alhambra: Owen Jones and Chromolithography.\" ''Architectural History'' 46(2003): 175\u2013188.</ref> Although Senefelder recorded plans for chromolithography, printers in other countries, such as [[France]] and [[England]], were also trying to find a new way to print in color. [[Godefroy Engelmann]] of [[Mulhouse]] in France was awarded a patent on chromolithography in July 1837,<ref name=\"ferry_chromo\"/> but there are disputes over whether chromolithography was already in use before this date, as some sources say, pointing to areas of printing such as the production of [[playing card]]s.<ref name=\"ferry_chromo\"/>\n\n==Offset press (1870s)==\n{{Main|Offset press}}\nOffset printing is a widely used [[printing]] technique where the inked image is transferred (or \"offset\") from a plate to a rubber blanket, then to the printing surface. When used in combination with the [[Lithography|lithographic]] process, which is based on the repulsion of oil and water, the offset technique employs a flat (planographic) image carrier on which the image to be printed obtains [[ink]] from ink rollers, while the non-printing area attracts a film of water, keeping the non-printing areas ink-free.\n\n==Screenprinting (1907)==\n{{Main|Screenprinting}}\nScreenprinting has its origins in simple [[stencil]]ling, most notably of the [[Japanese art|Japanese]] form ([[katazome]]), used who cut banana leaves and inserted ink through the design holes on textiles, mostly for clothing. This was taken up in France. The modern screenprinting process originated from patents taken out by Samuel Simon in 1907 in [[England]]. This idea was then adopted in [[San Francisco, California]], by John Pilsworth in 1914 who used screenprinting to form multicolor [[Printmaking|prints]] in a subtractive mode, differing from screenprinting as it is done today.\n\n==Flexography==\n{{Main|Flexography}}\n[[File:Flexography-Platecloseup.JPG|thumb|right|A flexographic printing plate.]]\nFlexography (also called \"surface printing\"), often abbreviated to \"flexo\", is a method of [[printing]] most commonly used for packaging (labels, tape, bags, boxes, banners, and so on).\n\nA flexo print is achieved by creating a mirrored master of the required image as a [[Three-dimensional space|3D]] [[relief]] in a [[rubber]] or [[polymer]] material.  A measured amount of [[ink]] is deposited upon the surface of the printing plate (or printing cylinder) using an [[anilox]] roll. The print surface then rotates, contacting the print material which transfers the ink.\n\nOriginally flexo printing was basic in quality. Labels requiring high quality have generally been printed by offset printing until recently. Great advances have been made to the quality of flexo printing presses.\n\nThe greatest advances though have been in the area of photopolymer printing plates, including improvements to the plate material and the method of plate creation. Usually, [[photography|photographic]] exposure followed by chemical etch or water washout. Direct [[laser engraving]] of an ablative surface allows direct-to-plate exposure of photopolymer plates.\n\n==Dot matrix printer (1968)==\n{{Main|Dot matrix printing}}\nA dot matrix printer or impact matrix printer is a type of [[computer printer]] with a print head that runs back and forth on the page and prints by impact, striking an ink-soaked cloth ribbon against the paper, much like a [[typewriter]]. Unlike a typewriter or [[daisy wheel printer]], letters are drawn out of a [[dot matrix]], and thus, varied fonts and arbitrary graphics can be produced.  Because the printing involves mechanical pressure, these printers can create [[Carbon copy|carbon copies]] and [[Carbonless copy paper|carbonless copies]].\n\nEach dot is produced by a tiny metal rod, also called a \"wire\" or \"pin\", which is driven forward by  the power of a tiny [[electromagnet]] or [[solenoid]], either directly or through small levers (pawls). Facing the ribbon and the paper is a small guide plate (often made of an artificial jewel such as [[sapphire]] or [[ruby]] [http://www.freepatentsonline.com/4194846.html]) pierced with holes to serve as guides for the pins. The moving portion of the printer is called the print head, and when running the printer as a generic text device generally prints one line of text at a time. Most dot matrix printers have a single vertical line of dot-making equipment on their print heads; others have a few interleaved rows in order to improve dot density.\n\nThe first dot-matrix [[Printer (computing)|printers]] were invented in Japan.<ref name=\"kent\">Allen Kent, James G.

It is often cited as \"taking up a whole room,\" implying that it was a primitive version of the later familiar device used with a [[personal computer]]. While large, it was designed for an entirely different purpose. Many 3800s are still in use.\n\nThe first laser printer designed for use with an individual computer was released with the [[Xerox Star]] 8010 in 1981. Although it was innovative, the Star was an expensive ($17,000) system that was only purchased by a small number of laboratories and institutions. After [[personal computer]]s became more widespread, the first laser printer intended for a mass market was the [[Hewlett-Packard|HP]] [[LaserJet]] 8ppm, released in 1984, using a [[Canon (company)|Canon]] engine controlled by HP software. The HP LaserJet printer was quickly followed by other laser printers from [[Brother Industries]], IBM, and others.\n\nMost noteworthy was the role the laser printer played in popularizing [[desktop publishing]] with the introduction of the [[Apple Computer|Apple]] [[LaserWriter]] for the Apple [[Macintosh]], along with [[Adobe PageMaker|Aldus PageMaker]] software, in 1985. With these products, users could create documents that would previously have required professional [[typesetting]].\n\n==Inkjet printer==\n{{Main|Inkjet printer}}\nInkjet printers are a type of [[computer printer]] that operates by propelling tiny droplets of liquid [[ink]] onto paper.\n\n==Dye-sublimation printer==\n{{Main|Dye-sublimation printer}}\nA dye-sublimation printer (or dye-sub printer) is a [[computer printer]] which employs a printing process that uses heat to transfer dye to a medium such as a plastic card, printer paper or poster paper.  The process is usually to lay one color at a time using a ribbon that has color panels. Most dye-sublimation printers use CMYO colors which differs from the more recognised [[CMYK]] colors in that the black dye is eliminated in favour of a clear overcoating. This overcoating (which has numerous names depending on the manufacturer) is effectively a thin laminate which protects the print from discoloration from UV light and the air while also rendering the print water-resistant. Many [[consumer]] and [[professional]] dye-sublimation printers are designed and used for producing [[photograph]]ic prints.\n\n==Digital press (1993)==\n{{Main|Digital printing}}\n\nDigital printing is the reproduction of [[digital images]] on a physical surface, such as [[paper|common]] or [[photographic paper]] or paperboard-cover stock, [[photographic film|film]], [[cloth]], [[plastic]], [[Polyvinyl chloride|vinyl]], [[magnets]], [[labels]] etc.\n\nIt can be differentiated from [[Lithograph|litho]], [[flexography]], [[gravure]] or [[letterpress]] printing in many ways, some of which are;\n* Every impression made onto the paper can be different, as opposed to making several hundred or thousand impressions of the same image from one set of printing plates, as in traditional methods.\n* The [[Ink]] or [[Toner]] does not absorb into the substrate, as does conventional ink, but forms a layer on the surface and may be fused to the substrate by using an inline fuser fluid with heat process (toner) or UV curing process (ink).\n* It generally requires less waste in terms of chemicals used and paper wasted in set up or makeready (bringing the image \"up to color\" and checking position).\n* It is excellent for rapid prototyping, or small print runs which means that it is more accessible to a wider range of designers and more cost effective in short runs.\n\n==Frescography (1998)==\n[[File:Comersee Spalier rgb.jpg|thumb|300px|With CAM-program created Frescography]]   \n[[File:Frescography.jpg|thumb|left|Screenshot of a CAM program for designing frescographies.]]{{Main|Frescography}}   \n'''Frescography''' is a method for reproduction/creation of [[mural]]s using [[digital printing]] methods, invented in 1998 by [[Rainer Maria Latzke]], and patented in 2000.

[[Computer aided mural|CAM]] software programs then allow to enter the measurements of a wall or ceiling to create a mural design with [[low resolution]] motifs. Since architectural elements such as beams, windows or doors can be integrated, the design will result in an accurately and tailor-fit wall [[mural]]. Once a design is finished, the [[low resolution]] motifs are converted into the original [[high resolution]] images and are printed on canvas by [[Wide-format printer]]s. The canvas then can be applied to the wall in a [[wall-paper]]hanging like procedure and will then look like on-site created mural.\n\n==3D printing==\n{{Main|3D printing}}\nThree-dimensional printing is a method of converting a virtual [[3D model]] into a physical object. 3D printing is a category of [[rapid prototyping]] technology. 3D printers typically work by 'printing' successive layers on top of the previous to build up a three dimensional object. 3D printers are generally faster, more affordable and easier to use than other additive fabrication technologies.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.ptonline.com/articles/200408cu3.html |title=Close-Up On Technology - 3D Printers Lead Growth of Rapid Prototyping - 08/04<!-- Bot generated title --> |access-date=2007-09-24 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100123144538/http://www.ptonline.com/articles/200408cu3.html |archive-date=2010-01-23 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\n==Technological developments==\n\n===Woodcut===\n{{main|Woodcut}}\nWoodcut is a [[relief printing]] artistic technique in printmaking in which an image is carved into the surface of a block of wood, with the printing parts remaining level with the surface while the non-printing parts are removed, typically with gouges. The areas to show 'white' are cut away with a knife or chisel, leaving the characters or image to show in 'black' at the original surface level. The block is cut along the grain of the wood (unlike [[wood engraving]] where the block is cut in the end-grain). In Europe [[beech]]wood was most commonly used; in Japan, a special type of [[cherry]] wood was popular.\n\nWoodcut first appeared in ancient China. From 6th century onward, woodcut icons became popular and especially flourished in [[Chinese Buddhism]]. Since the 10th century, woodcut pictures appeared as illustrations in Chinese books, on [[banknote]]s such as [[Jiaozi (currency)]], and as single sheet images. Woodcut [[New Year picture]]s are also very popular with the Chinese.\n\nIn China and Tibet printed images mostly remained tied as illustrations to accompanying text until the modern period. The earliest woodblock printed book, the [[Diamond Sutra]] contains a large image as frontispiece, and many Buddhist texts contain some images. Later some notable Chinese artists designed woodcuts for books, the individual print develop in China in the form of [[New Year picture]] as an art-form in the way it did in Europe and Japan.\n\nIn Europe, woodcut is the oldest technique used for [[old master print]]s, developing about 1400, by using on paper existing techniques for printing on cloth. The explosion of sales of cheap woodcuts in the middle of the century led to a fall in standards, and many [[popular prints]] were very crude. The development of [[hatching]] followed on rather later than in [[engraving]]. [[Michael Wolgemut]] was significant in making German woodcut more sophisticated from about 1475, and [[Erhard Reuwich]] was the first to use cross-hatching (far harder to do than in engraving or [[etching]]). Both of these produced mainly book-illustrations, as did various Italian artists who were also raising standards there at the same period. At the end of the century [[Albrecht D\u00fcrer]] brought the Western woodcut to a level that has never been surpassed, and greatly increased the status of the ''single-leaf'' (i.e. an image sold separately) woodcut.\n\n===Engraving===\n{{Main|Engraving}}\nEngraving is the practice of incising a design onto a hard, flat surface, by cutting grooves into it. The result may be a decorated object in itself, as when [[silver]], [[gold]] or [[steel]] are engraved, or may provide an [[intaglio (printmaking)|intaglio]] printing plate, of [[copper]] or another metal, for printing images on paper, which are called engravings. Engraving was a historically important method of producing images on paper, both in artistic [[printmaking]], and also for commercial reproductions and illustrations for books and magazines. It has long been replaced by [[photography]] in its commercial applications and, partly because of the difficulty of learning the technique, is much less common in printmaking, where it has been largely replaced by [[etching]] and other techniques. Other terms often used for engravings are ''copper-plate engraving'' and ''[[Line engraving]]''. These should all mean exactly the same, but especially in the past were often used very loosely to cover several printmaking techniques, so that many so-called engravings were in fact produced by totally different techniques, such as etching.\n\nIn [[Ancient history|antiquity]], the only engraving that could be carried out is evident in the shallow grooves found in some jewellery after the beginning of the 1st Millennium B.C. The majority of so-called engraved designs on ancient gold rings or other items were produced by [[chasing (metalworking)|chasing]] or sometimes a combination of [[lost-wax casting]] and chasing.\n\nIn the European Middle Ages goldsmiths used engraving to decorate and inscribe metalwork. It is thought that they began to print impressions of their designs to record them. From this grew the engraving of copper printing plates to produce artistic images on paper, known as [[old master print]]s in Germany in the 1430s. Italy soon followed. Many early engravers came from a goldsmithing background. The first and greatest period of the engraving was from about 1470 to 1530, with such masters as [[Martin Schongauer]], [[Albrecht D\u00fcrer]], and [[Lucas van Leiden]].\n\n===Etching===\n{{Main|Etching}}\nEtching is the process of using strong acid or mordant to cut into the unprotected parts of a metal surface to create a design in intaglio in the metal (the original process\u2014in modern manufacturing other chemicals may be used on other types of material). As an intaglio method of printmaking it is, along with engraving, the most important technique for [[old master print]]s, and remains widely used today.\n\n===Halftoning===\n{{Main|Halftone}}\nHalftone is the [[reprographic]] technique that simulates ones it is [[continuous tone]] imagery through the use of equally spaced dots of varying size.<ref name=\"campbell\">Campbell, Alastair. The Designer's Lexicon. \u00a92000 Chronicle, San Francisco.</ref> 'Halftone' can also be used to refer specifically to the image that is produced by this process.<ref name=\"campbell\"/>\n\nThe idea of halftone printing originates from [[William Fox Talbot]]. In the early 1850s he suggested using \"photographic screens or veils\" in connection with a photographic [[intaglio (printmaking)|intaglio]] process.<ref name=twyman1970>Twyman, Michael. Eyre & Spottiswoode, London 1970.</ref>\n\nSeveral different kinds of screens were proposed during the following decades, but the first half-tone photo-engraving process was invented by Canadians George-\u00c9douard Desbarats and William Leggo Jr.<ref>{{cite DCB |last=Galarneau |first=Claude |title=Desbarats, George-\u00c9douard-Amable |volume=12 |url=http://www.biographi.ca/en/bio/desbarats_george_edouard_12E.html}}</ref> On October 30, 1869, Desbarats published the ''Canadian Illustrated News'' which became the world's first periodical to successfully employ this photo-mechanical technique; featuring a full page half-tone image of His Royal Highness Prince Arthur, from a photograph by Notman.[https://web.archive.org/web/20080523101009/http://www.collectionscanada.gc.ca/cin/026019-119.01-e.php] Ambitious to exploit a much larger circulation, Debarats and Leggo went to New York and launched the ''New York Daily Graphic'' in March 1873, which became the world's first illustrated daily.\n\nThe first truly successful commercial method was patented by [[Frederic Eugene Ives|Frederic Ives]] of [[Philadelphia]] in 1881.<ref name=\"twyman1970\"/><ref>Meggs (1998), 141.</ref> But although he found a way of breaking up the image into dots of varying sizes he did not make use of a screen. In 1882 the German [[George Meisenbach]] patented a halftone process in England. His invention was based on the previous ideas of Berchtold and Swan. He used single lined screens which were turned during exposure to produce cross-lined effects. He was the first to achieve  any commercial success with [[relief print|relief]] halftones.<ref name=twyman1970/>\n\n===Xerography===\n{{Main|Xerography}}\nXerography (or electrophotography) is a [[photocopying]] technique developed by [[Chester Carlson]] in 1938 and [[patent]]ed on October 6, 1942. He received {{US patent|2297691}} for his [[invention]]. The name xerography came from the Greek radicals ''xeros'' (dry) and ''graphos'' (writing), because there are no liquid chemicals involved in the process, unlike earlier reproduction techniques like [[cyanotype]].\n\nIn 1938 [[Bulgaria]]n [[physicist]] [[Georgi Nadjakov]] found that when placed into electric field and exposed to light, some dielectrics acquire permanent electric polarization in the exposed areas.[https://web.archive.org/web/20071101024139/http://www.issp.bas.bg/lab/ephi/Museum/acad_GNadjakov/GN11-page5.html] That polarization persists in the dark and is destroyed in light.\n[[Chester Carlson]], the inventor of photocopying, was originally a [[patent attorney]] and part-time researcher and inventor. His job at the patent office in [[New York City]] required him to make a large number of copies of important papers. Carlson, who was [[arthritis|arthritic]], found this a painful and tedious process. This prompted him to conduct experiments with [[photoconductivity]]. Carlson experimented with \"[[electrophotography]]\" in his kitchen and in 1938, applied for a patent for the process. He made the first \"photocopy\" using a [[zinc]] plate covered with [[sulfur]]. The words \"10-22-38 Astoria\" were written on a [[microscope]] slide, which was placed on top of more sulfur and under a bright light. After the slide was removed, a mirror image of the words remained. Carlson tried to sell his invention to some companies, but because the process was still underdeveloped he failed. At the time multiple copies were made using carbon paper or duplicating machines and people did not feel the need for an electronic machine. Between 1939 and 1944, Carlson was turned down by over 20 companies, including [[IBM]] and [[General Electric|GE]], neither of which believed there was a significant market for copiers.{{Citation needed|date=December 2008}}\n\n==See also==\n*[[History of the alphabet]]\n*[[History of writing]]\n*[[History of paper]]\n*[[Phaistos disc]] (a stamping technology considered by some researchers to be a precursor of printing)\n*[[History of graphic design]]\n*[[Publishing]]\n*[[Global spread of the printing press]]\n* [[History of books]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n*{{citation|last=Barrett|first=Timothy Hugh|title=The Woman Who Discovered Printing|year=2008|publisher=[[Yale University Press]]|location=Great Britain|isbn=978-0-300-12728-7}} (alk. paper)\n*{{citation|last=Chia|first=Lucille|year=2011|title=Knowledge and Text Production in an Age of Print: China, 900-1400|publisher=Brill}}\n*{{citation|last=Tsien|first=Tsuen-Hsuin|authorlink=Tsien Tsuen-hsuin|title=Paper and Printing|volume=vol. 5 part 1|series=Needham, Joseph ''Science and Civilization in China:''|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=1985|ISBN= 0-521-08690-6}}\n*{{citation|last=Twitchett|first=Denis|title=The Cambridge History of China Volume 8 The Ming Dynasty, 1368\u20141644, Part 2|year=1998b|publisher=Cambridge University Press}}\n*{{citation|last=Wilkinson|first=Endymion|year=2012|title=Chinese History: A New Manual|publisher=Harvard University Asia Center for the Harvard-Yenching Institute}}\n*{{citation|last=McMurtrie|first=Douglas C.|year=1962|title=THE BOOK: The Story of Printing & Bookmaking|publisher=Oxford University Press, seventh edition}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:History Of Printing}}\n[[Category:History of printing| ]]\n[[Category:History of writing|Printing]]\n[[Category:Textual scholarship]]\n[[Category:History of science by discipline|Printing]]\n", "name_user": "Iridescent", "label": "safe", "comment": "Cleanup andtypo fixing,typo(s) fixed: 650-670 \u2192 650\u2013670 (2)", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_printing"}
