In ''Elsinore'', Ophelia has a vision of the deaths of everyone in [[Elsinore Castle]] and relives the same four days again and again as she works to prevent the tragedy that will fall over everyone.\n\nDevelopment on ''Elsinore'' took over seven years, and was created on nights and weekends by a team of friends who attended [[Carnegie Mellon]] along with some independent developers. The game received generally positive reviews from critics, who generally noted that fans of ''Hamlet'' would appreciate it but that the game's slow pace could be sometimes frustrating.\n\n==Gameplay==\n[[File:Elsinorescreenshot.jpg|thumb|right|[[Laertes (Hamlet)|Laertes]] and [[Hamlet (character)|Hamlet]] duel as Ophelia watches. The journal and other ways the player can see what's currently happening in Elsinore Castle are found in the top left of the screen, while a map shows Ophelia's current location in the top right.]]\n''Elsinore'' is a [[point and click]] [[adventure game]] in which the player controls ''[[Hamlet]]''{{'}}s [[Ophelia]] as she experiences a time loop leading up to the tragedy at the end of the play.<ref name=\"Wired\">{{Cite news|url=https://www.wired.com/story/elsinore-review/|author=Muncy, Julie|date=2019-08-08|title='Elsinore' Smartly Reimagines 'Hamlet' with Ophelia as the Hero|work=Wired|access-date=2020-04-18|language=en|issn=1059-1028}}</ref> During the four days leading up to the events described at the end of ''Hamlet'', the player is able to move Ophelia throughout [[Elsinore Castle]] and have Ophelia talk with its residents in order to try and manipulate the outcome of events. The conversations the player has Ophelia hold with other castle residents often leads to unforeseen outcomes in which tragedy still occurs in other ways\u2014 every time Ophelia dies, the time loop begins again, four days before the end of ''Hamlet''.\n\nIn order to manipulate the events in ''Elsinore'', the player is able to talk with people in the castle about events that they have seen or expect to occur. The game provides a \"Hearsay\" menu, which indicates subjects that Ophelia can bring up to people in the castle.<ref name=\"ag\">{{Cite web|url=https://adventuregamers.com/articles/view/38849|title=Elsinore review|author=Morganti, Emily|date=2019-10-25|website=Adventure Gamers|language=en|access-date=2020-04-18}}</ref> The game includes a timeline that shows the player possible permutations that they can be aware of, showing both the location of an event to happen and the time of it so Ophelia can easily witness it. Outside of Ophelia's deaths, the game has 13 unique endings that are available to the player which change based on the player's choices throughout the game.<ref name=\"ag\" />\n\n===Plot===\nThe game hems closely to the plot of ''Hamlet'' at its core, but also contains significant changes from both the source material and how it was traditionally performed. The game begins with Ophelia experiencing a vision, which shows the deaths of everyone in Elsinore Castle. The player is then able to try to manipulate the events of the game to avoid the events of the play ''Hamlet''. If the player does nothing, the events of ''Hamlet'' unfold by default and everyone dies.<ref name=\"biz\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.gamesindustry.biz/articles/2020-01-30-in-elsinore-more-matter-is-more-art|author=Valentine, Rebekah|date=2020-01-30|title=In Elsinore, more matter is more art|website=GamesIndustry.biz|language=en|access-date=2020-04-18}}</ref> Development of ''Elsinore'' began in 2010.<ref name=\"biz\" />\n\nSome major differences include that Ophelia is assassinated instead of killing herself (which the player must work to stop), and that Ophelia and Laertes both have much larger roles in the play. [[Rosencrantz and Guildenstern]] are both women, Ophelia and [[Laertes]] are both [[people of color]] and have experienced discrimination because of it, [[Othello]] appears in a bar in town, and the game adds additional characters to flesh out the story. [[Peter Quince]] from ''[[A Midsummer Night's Dream]]'' appears instead of the troupe of performers that are in ''Hamlet'', and he is one of the few characters who is aware of Ophelia's time loop.\n\n==Development==\nTeam lead and writer Katie Chironis and game designer Connor Fallon originally met in [[Carnegie Mellon]]'s Game Creation Society.<ref name=\"biz\" /> Development of ''Elsinore'' began in 2010.<ref name=\"biz\" /> Chironis and Fallon originally created ''Elsinore'' as part of a [[Game Jam]], scrapped the project entirely, and then decided to create it from the ground up again.<ref name=\"biz\" /> Chironis was inspired to make a ''Hamlet'' game from both her high school Shakespeare teacher and from the college writing classes she took at Carnegie Mellon.<ref name=\"biz\" /> Chironis and Fallon wanted to create a game that would have a tragic story but in an interactive medium, eschewing the \"power fantasy\" games that are commonly created.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.latimes.com/entertainment/movies/la-et-ophelia-reconsidered-20190706-story.html|title=Shakespeare\u2019s Ophelia gets bold new makeovers in a film and a video game|author=Rome, Emily|date=2019-07-06|website=Los Angeles Times|language=en-US|access-date=2020-04-18}}</ref> By combining the tragedy of Hamlet with the goal of \"winning\" games, the development team thought they could have a fresh take on ''Hamlet''.<ref name=\"marysue\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.themarysue.com/tms-elsinore-interview/|title=The Mary Sue Interview: Katie Chironis and Connor Fallon on Elsinore|author=Lachenal, Jessica|website=www.themarysue.com|access-date=2020-04-18}}</ref>\n\nChironis and Fallon created their company, Golden Glitch, with five other founders that had been part of the Game Creation Society, and worked on the project during nights and weekends while keeping their day jobs\u2014 the founders received no profits until after the game went on sale.<ref name=\"biz\" /> The team's four contractors were paid from their personal salaries from their other jobs.<ref name=\"biz\" /> In 2015, Golden Glitch created a [[Kickstarter]] for ''Elsinore'', which was successfully funded and reached over $32,000 raised.<ref name=\"kickstarter\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/235466673/elsinore-a-time-looping-adventure-game|title=Elsinore, a time-looping adventure game|website=Kickstarter|language=en|access-date=2020-04-18}}</ref> Despite an original targeted release date of 2015, the game was eventually released in 2019 instead.\n\n''[[The Legend of Zelda: Majora's Mask]]'' provided inspiration for how to implement time loops in the game, and Golden Glitch drew inspiration from [[anime]] and [[visual novels]] which had many examples of time loops as a plot mechanic.

During the season, tropical cyclones were officially monitored by the [[Fiji Meteorological Service]] (FMS), Australian [[Bureau of Meteorology]] (BOM) and New Zealand's [[MetService]]. The [[United States Armed Forces]] through the [[Joint Typhoon Warning Center]] <small>(JTWC)</small> also monirors the basin and issue unofficial warnings for American interests. The FMS attaches a number and an F suffix to tropical disturbances that form in or move into the basin while the JTWC designates significant tropical cyclones with a number and a P suffix. The FMS, BoM and MetService all use the [[Australian Tropical Cyclone Intensity Scale]] and estimate wind speeds over a period of ten minutes, while the JTWC estimated sustained winds over a 1-minute period, which are subsequently compared to the [[Saffir\u2013Simpson hurricane wind scale]] <small>(SSHWS)</small>.\n\n__TOC__\n{{clear}}\n\n==Seasonal forecasts==\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"float:right\"\n|- \n!

Rita would then peak as a Category 3 on the [[Australian scale]]. Tropical Disturbance 02F was designated sometime later, but didn't last long after that. Sarai formed on December 23, lasting into the new year before finally ceasing to exist on January 2. Not too long after that, Tino formed and affected eastern [[Fiji]] and the surrounding area before dissipating. On January 24, a depression formed and dissipated the next day without been named. In early February, another low originally in the Australian region crossed the [[160th meridian east]] and emerged in the South Pacific. It strengthened into severe tropical cyclone Uesi and affected New Caledonia and New Zealand. In mid-February four disturbances formed, 07F, 08F, 09F and 10F. 07F & 08F dissipated before becoming tropical depressions but the other 2 strengthened into tropical cyclones Vicky and Wasi. In mid March, Gretel entered the basin. It dissipated shortly afterwards. In early April, Harold also entered the basin from the Australian region. It rapidly intensified into a Category 5 Severe tropical cyclone as it impacted [[Vanuatu]].\n\n==Systems==\n===Severe Tropical Cyclone Rita===\n{{Infobox tropical cyclone small\n|Basin=SPac\n|Image=Rita 2019-11-24 2240Z.jpg\n|Track=Rita 2019 track.png\n|Formed=November 22\n|Dissipated=November 26\n|10-min winds=65\n|1-min winds=65\n|Pressure=977\n}}\n\nBeginning November 21, the [[Fiji Meteorological Service]] (FMS) began highlighting the likelihood of a [[tropical cyclone]] forming between [[Vanuatu]] and [[Fiji]].<ref name=\"5Day_21Nov\">{{cite report|title=Tropical Cyclone - 5 Day Outlook (21 November 2019)|type=5 Day Outlook|publisher=Fiji Meteorological Service |location=Nadi, Fiji|date=November 21, 2019}}</ref> Showers and thunderstorms began to aggregate in the region atop [[sea surface temperature]]s above {{cvt|29|C|F}} in low-[[wind shear]] conditions.<ref name=\"TDS_22Nov1930\">{{cite report|type=Tropical Disturbance Summary|title=Tropical Disturbance Summary for 22 November 0930 UTC |publisher=Fiji Meteorological Service |date=November 22, 2019}}</ref> Imagery from [[Microwave radiometer|microwave satellite data]] showed emergent [[rainband]]s wrapping towards an organising [[low-pressure area|center of low pressure]].<ref>{{cite report|title=Significant Tropical Weather Advisory for the Western and South Pacific Oceans (November 22 2000 UTC) |publisher=United States Joint Typhoon Warning Center  |date=November 22, 2019}}</ref> Late on November 22, the FMS designated the system, now east of the [[Solomon Islands]], as Tropical Disturbance 01F.<ref name=\"TDS_22Nov2100\">{{cite report|type=Tropical Disturbance Summary|title=Tropical Disturbance Summary for November 22 2100 UTC |publisher=Fiji Meteorological Service |date=November 22, 2019}}</ref> The slow-moving disturbance tracked towards the south and southeast,<ref>{{cite report|title=Tropical Disturbance Advisory Number A1 for Tropical Depression 01F|publisher=Fiji Meteorological Service |date=November 23, 2019}}</ref> steered by a broad [[subtropical ridge|area of high pressure]].

All [[COVID-19]] preparedness activities were suspended to facilitate preparations and evacuations for Harold. Harold was the first Category 5 severe tropical cyclone on the Australian scale to strike Vanuatu since [[Cyclone Pam]] in [[2014\u201315 South Pacific cyclone season|2015]], bringing gusts above 275 km/h (170 mph), 250\u2013450 mm (10\u201318 in) of rain, and a storm surge of 0.8 m (2.6 ft) causing catastrophic damage, torrential flooding and communication disruptions and plunging Vanuatu into a blackout.\n\n[[International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies]] (IFRC) granted 50,000 [[Swiss franc|CHF]] from its Disaster Relief Emergency Fund to the Vanuatu Red Cross Society to help better position staff and aid resources prior to the storm's arrival, mobilizing over a thousand volunteers. Preparing for the storm in [[Luganville]], hundreds of people were sent into evacuation centres before the storm. The Torba provincial headquarters in [[Sola, Vanuatu|Sola]] served as a shelter for families. Development organisation [[Oxfam Australia]] coordinated with Vanuatuan agencies to develop a response plan for Harold. The Australian [[Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade (Australia)|Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade]] also devised a support package for both the Solomon Islands and Vanuatu.\n\nIn [[Fiji]], heavy rain alerts were issued for the western half of [[Viti Levu]], [[Kadavu Island|Kadavu]], and the [[Mamanuca Islands|Mamanuca]] and [[Yasawa Islands|Yasawa]] islands on April 6. Storm warnings were later put in effect for the areas under a heavy rain alert, in addition to the [[Lomaiviti Islands]]. The highest warning, a hurricane warning, was issued for Kadavu and [[Ono-i-Lau]] on April 7. The Fiji National Disaster Management Office (FDNMO) activated their Emergency Operations Centre to streamline preparations and evacuations. A total of eighty-five shelters were opened, with at least two in each of Fiji's four districts. All village headmen and community leaders were directed to. All COVID-19-related activities were also cancelled in order to prepare for the impact of Harold. Early on April 7, the storm began affecting the nation with gusty winds, moderate coastal flooding, and storm surge. These conditioners worsened as the storm approached. In contrast to the forecasts, the passed only to the south of Fiji and thus, the northern islands received little damage.

the [[South Pacific Ocean]] to the east of 160\u00b0E. The season officially runs from November 1, 2019 to April 30, 2020, however a tropical cyclone could form at any time between July 1, 2019 and June 30, 2020 and would count towards the season total. During the season, tropical cyclones were officially monitored by the [[Fiji Meteorological Service]] (FMS), Australian [[Bureau of Meteorology]] (BOM) and New Zealand's [[MetService]]. The [[United States Armed Forces]] through the [[Joint Typhoon Warning Center]] <small>(JTWC)</small> also monirors the basin and issue unofficial warnings for American interests. The FMS attaches a number and an F suffix to tropical disturbances that form in or move into the basin while the JTWC designates significant tropical cyclones with a number and a P suffix. The FMS, BoM and MetService all use the [[Australian Tropical Cyclone Intensity Scale]] and estimate wind speeds over a period of ten minutes, while the JTWC estimated sustained winds over a 1-minute period, which are subsequently compared to the [[Saffir\u2013Simpson hurricane wind scale]] <small>(SSHWS)</small>.\n\n__TOC__\n{{clear}}\n\n==Seasonal forecasts==\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"float:right\"\n|- \n!

Rita would then peak as a Category 3 on the [[Australian scale]]. Tropical Disturbance 02F was designated sometime later, but didn't last long after that. Sarai formed on December 23, lasting into the new year before finally ceasing to exist on January 2. Not too long after that, Tino formed and affected eastern [[Fiji]] and the surrounding area before dissipating. On January 24, a depression formed and dissipated the next day without been named. In early February, another low originally in the Australian region crossed the [[160th meridian east]] and emerged in the South Pacific. It strengthened into severe tropical cyclone Uesi and affected New Caledonia and New Zealand. In mid-February four disturbances formed, 07F, 08F, 09F and 10F. 07F & 08F dissipated before becoming tropical depressions but the other 2 strengthened into tropical cyclones Vicky and Wasi. In mid March, Gretel entered the basin. It dissipated shortly afterwards. In early April, Harold also entered the basin from the Australian region. It rapidly intensified into a Category 5 Severe tropical cyclone as it impacted [[Vanuatu]].\n\n==Systems==\n===Severe Tropical Cyclone Rita===\n{{Infobox tropical cyclone small\n|Basin=SPac\n|Image=Rita 2019-11-24 2240Z.jpg\n|Track=Rita 2019 track.png\n|Formed=November 22\n|Dissipated=November 26\n|10-min winds=65\n|1-min winds=65\n|Pressure=977\n}}\n\nBeginning November 21, the [[Fiji Meteorological Service]] (FMS) began highlighting the likelihood of a [[tropical cyclone]] forming between [[Vanuatu]] and [[Fiji]].<ref name=\"5Day_21Nov\">{{cite report|title=Tropical Cyclone - 5 Day Outlook (21 November 2019)|type=5 Day Outlook|publisher=Fiji Meteorological Service |location=Nadi, Fiji|date=November 21, 2019}}</ref> Showers and thunderstorms began to aggregate in the region atop [[sea surface temperature]]s above {{cvt|29|C|F}} in low-[[wind shear]] conditions.<ref name=\"TDS_22Nov1930\">{{cite report|type=Tropical Disturbance Summary|title=Tropical Disturbance Summary for 22 November 0930 UTC |publisher=Fiji Meteorological Service |date=November 22, 2019}}</ref> Imagery from [[Microwave radiometer|microwave satellite data]] showed emergent [[rainband]]s wrapping towards an organising [[low-pressure area|center of low pressure]].<ref>{{cite report|title=Significant Tropical Weather Advisory for the Western and South Pacific Oceans (November 22 2000 UTC) |publisher=United States Joint Typhoon Warning Center  |date=November 22, 2019}}</ref> Late on November 22, the FMS designated the system, now east of the [[Solomon Islands]], as Tropical Disturbance 01F.<ref name=\"TDS_22Nov2100\">{{cite report|type=Tropical Disturbance Summary|title=Tropical Disturbance Summary for November 22 2100 UTC |publisher=Fiji Meteorological Service |date=November 22, 2019}}</ref> The slow-moving disturbance tracked towards the south and southeast,<ref>{{cite report|title=Tropical Disturbance Advisory Number A1 for Tropical Depression 01F|publisher=Fiji Meteorological Service |date=November 23, 2019}}</ref> steered by a broad [[subtropical ridge|area of high pressure]].

All [[COVID-19]] preparedness activities were suspended to facilitate preparations and evacuations for Harold. Harold was the first Category 5 severe tropical cyclone on the Australian scale to strike Vanuatu since [[Cyclone Pam]] in [[2014\u201315 South Pacific cyclone season|2015]], bringing gusts above 275 km/h (170 mph), 250\u2013450 mm (10\u201318 in) of rain, and a storm surge of 0.8 m (2.6 ft) causing catastrophic damage, torrential flooding and communication disruptions and plunging Vanuatu into a blackout.\n\n[[International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies]] (IFRC) granted 50,000 [[Swiss franc|CHF]] from its Disaster Relief Emergency Fund to the Vanuatu Red Cross Society to help better position staff and aid resources prior to the storm's arrival, mobilizing over a thousand volunteers. Preparing for the storm in [[Luganville]], hundreds of people were sent into evacuation centres before the storm. The Torba provincial headquarters in [[Sola, Vanuatu|Sola]] served as a shelter for families. Development organisation [[Oxfam Australia]] coordinated with Vanuatuan agencies to develop a response plan for Harold. The Australian [[Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade (Australia)|Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade]] also devised a support package for both the Solomon Islands and Vanuatu.\n\nIn [[Fiji]], heavy rain alerts were issued for the western half of [[Viti Levu]], [[Kadavu Island|Kadavu]], and the [[Mamanuca Islands|Mamanuca]] and [[Yasawa Islands|Yasawa]] islands on April 6. Storm warnings were later put in effect for the areas under a heavy rain alert, in addition to the [[Lomaiviti Islands]]. The highest warning, a hurricane warning, was issued for Kadavu and [[Ono-i-Lau]] on April 7. The Fiji National Disaster Management Office (FDNMO) activated their Emergency Operations Centre to streamline preparations and evacuations. A total of eighty-five shelters were opened, with at least two in each of Fiji's four districts. All village headmen and community leaders were directed to. All COVID-19-related activities were also cancelled in order to prepare for the impact of Harold. Early on April 7, the storm began affecting the nation with gusty winds, moderate coastal flooding, and storm surge. These conditioners worsened as the storm approached.

{"title_page": "Star Trek crossovers", "text_new": "{{DISPLAYTITLE:''Star Trek'' crossovers}}\n{{Redirect|Crossovers (Star Trek)|Deep Space Nine episode|Crossover (Star Trek: Deep Space Nine)}}\n\nSeveral characters within the ''[[Star Trek]]'' franchise, primary and secondary, often made [[fictional crossover|crossover appearances]] between one live-action series and another. This included appearances of established characters on premiere episodes of new series, a few long-term transfers from one series to another, and even crossovers between ''Trek'' films and television. A few crossover appearances, such as that of [[Spock]] on ''[[Star Trek: The Next Generation|The Next Generation]]'' and the time-travel of the crew of ''[[Star Trek: Deep Space Nine|Deep Space Nine]]'' to the era of ''[[Star Trek: The Original Series|The Original Series]]'' were especially lauded by both fans and critics.\n\n==Appearances in series premieres==\nAfter the original series, a character from an earlier series appeared in the premiere episode of each new series. These were the appearances of [[Leonard McCoy]] in \"[[Encounter at Farpoint]]\", the first episode of ''The Next Generation''; that of Captain [[Jean-Luc Picard]] in \"[[Emissary (Star Trek: Deep Space Nine)|Emissary]]\", the first episode of ''Deep Space Nine''; [[Quark (Star Trek)|Quark]] and [[Morn]] in \"[[Caretaker (Star Trek: Voyager)|Caretaker]]\", the premiere of ''Voyager''; [[Zefram Cochrane]] (from the original series episode \"[[Metamorphosis (Star Trek: The Original Series)|Metamorphosis]]\" and the film ''[[Star Trek: First Contact]]'') in \"[[Broken Bow (Star Trek: Enterprise)|Broken Bow]]\", the premiere of ''Enterprise''; and [[Sarek]] in \"[[The Vulcan Hello]]\", the first episode of ''Discovery''.\n\n==Long-term transitions==\nTwo long-term transitions were the transfer of [[Worf]] and [[Miles O'Brien (Star Trek)|Miles O'Brien]] from permanent characters on ''The Next Generation'' to permanent characters on ''Deep Space Nine''. Worf stayed on ''The Next Generation'' until its conclusion, then transferred from the start of season 4 of ''DS9''. Chief O'Brien had appeared in fifty episodes of ''The Next Generation'', but only gained opening credits billing on ''DS9'', in which he appeared in almost every episode of all seven seasons. While not seen as often as Chief O'Brien, his wife [[Keiko O'Brien]] also transitioned as a series regular guest star from ''The Next Generation'' to ''Deep Space Nine'', bringing their daughter [[Molly O'Brien|Molly]]. Miles O'Brien reprised his ''Next Generation'' role in that series' finale \"[[All Good Things... (Star Trek: The Next Generation)|All Good Things...]]\".\n\n==Episodes and films focused on crossovers==\n\n===Television-to-television crossover===\n\nAn especially significant crossover is Spock's appearance on the two-part ''Next Generation'' episode \"[[Unification (Star Trek: The Next Generation)|Unification]]\". Spock meets Data and they exchange opinions on the relative value of logic and emotion, and share mutual impressions of ''Next Generation''{{'}}s Captain Picard (who for Spock is a model of logical behavior, and for Data is a model of what it means to be human). Critics such as Ina Rae Hark have noted this encounter between two non-human characters summarizes their contrasting attitudes to humanity, Data embodying Spock's ideal of pure logic, while Data aspires to be more human.<ref>{{cite book |title=Star Trek: BFI TV Classics |last=Hark |first=Ina Rae |authorlink= |year=2008 |publisher=MacMillan |location= |isbn=9781844572144 |page=64 |pages= |url= |accessdate=}}</ref>\n\n[[Scotty (Star Trek)|Scotty]] appears in TNG Season 6, Episode 4 \"[[Relics (Star Trek: The Next Generation)|Relics]]\".\n\nRecycled footage from the original series episode \"[[The Trouble with Tribbles]]\" is used extensively in ''Deep Space Nine''{{'}}s time-travel episode \"[[Trials and Tribble-ations]]\". In addition to extensive archival footage of cast from the original series, actor [[Charlie Brill]] (portraying Klingon spy [[Arne Darvin]]) appears in both new and archival footage. The episode was designed to coincide with the 30th anniversary of the original series. Critic Matthew Kappell notes that the new episode simultaneously \"parodies and valorizes\" the original series, highlighting the discontinuities between two eras of ''Trek'' while trying simultaneously to weave them together.<ref>{{cite book |title=Star Trek as myth: essays on symbol and archetype at the final frontier |last=Kapell |first=Matthew Wilhelm |authorlink= |year=2010 |publisher=McFarland |location= |isbn=9780786447244 |page=83 |pages= |url= |accessdate=}}</ref>\n\nWilliam Riker and Deanna Troi from ''The Next Generation'' appear in a flash-forward to the future in \"[[These Are the Voyages...]]\", the final episode of ''Enterprise''. This episode was widely criticized by both cast members and fans for playing more like a ''Next Generation'' episode to the point of being an inappropriate wrap-up for the series.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://theedge.bostonherald.com/tvNews/view.bg?articleid=82256|archivedate=2006-03-18 | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20060318130122/http://theedge.bostonherald.com/tvNews/view.bg?articleid=82256|title=Jolene Blalock interview| work=[[Boston Herald]]|accessdate=2008-11-08}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|author=Salem, Rob|date=2005-05-09|title=Trek fatigued, producer admits. Enterprise limps off to oblivion |work=[[Toronto Star]]|page=E1}}</ref>\n\n===Film-to-television crossover===\n\nIn the ''Voyager'' episode \"[[Flashback (Star Trek: Voyager)|Flashback]]\", events from the film ''Star Trek VI: The Undiscovered Country'' (1991) play a pivotal role, and are re-enacted with  the same actors thus allowing George Takei to reprise his role as [[Hikaru Sulu]]. The episode contains the added revelation that the USS ''Voyager''{{'}}s [[Tuvok]] was on Sulu's ship ''Excelsior'' at the time. In bit of rather glaring discontinuity, the character of Lieutenant Dimitri Valtane, who appears in both the 1996 third season Voyager Episode and the 1991 feature film is shown to still be alive at the end of ''Undiscovered Country''. While that same character in the \"Flashback\" episode, is shown to have died prior to the feature films concluding scene in which the ''Excelsior'' crew bid farewell to the USS ''Enterprise'' crew. A scene from the film in which Valtane is visibly featured, and Tuvok is completely absent. Though the actor Tim Russ whom portrayed Tuvok, made an appearance as a Star Fleet bridge officer from the same fictional time period, serving on the [[USS ''Enterprise'' NCC-1701-B]] in the feature film [[''Star Trek Generations'']] (1994). Critic Lincoln Geraghty cites this as an example of ''Star Trek''{{'}}s ongoing propensity for reverential recognition of earlier versions of the series.<ref>{{cite book |title=Living with Star Trek: American culture and the Star Trek universe |last=Geraghty |first=Lincoln |authorlink= |year=2007 |publisher=I.B.Tauris |location= |isbn=9781845112653 |page=51 |pages= |url= |accessdate=}}</ref>\n\n===Television-to-film crossover===\n\nThe film ''[[Star Trek Generations]]'' brought Kirk and Picard, ''Enterprise'' captains from different centuries, together to defeat a common enemy. It also marked the passing of the film franchise from the original series cast to that of ''The Next Generation''.\n\n==Characters more prominent on subsequent series==\nA few occasional recurring characters introduced in one series continued into other series, sometimes attaining more significant roles in their subsequent ''Trek'' series than in the one in which they were first introduced:\n\n* Spock's father [[Sarek]] appeared in only one episode of the original series, but became a more developed character in three movies and ''[[Star Trek: Discovery]]'' and appeared in [[Sarek (Star Trek: The Next Generation)|the ''Next Generation'' episode named after him]] and the first part of \"Unification\". Sarek's appearance in the former is described in ''The Star Trek: The Next Generation Companion'' as \"the first major unifying event tying together the old and new Trek eras since McCoy's cameo\" in the original series.<ref>{{cite book |title=The Star Trek: The Next Generation Companion: Revised Edition |last=Nemecek |first=Larry |authorlink= |year=2003 |publisher=Simon and Schuster |location= |isbn=9780743457989 |page=127 |pages= |url= |accessdate=}}</ref>\n* Recurring character [[Q (Star Trek)|Q]], originally introduced in the premiere episode of ''Next Generation'', continued to appear in episodes of ''Deep Space Nine'' and ''Voyager''. Teleplay writer Robert Wolfe found it difficult to incorporate Q into the ''DS9'' universe as the character had been conceived so much as a foil for Captain Picard. He eventually decided to use Q to show personality differences between Picard and Sisko.<ref>{{cite book |title=Star trek: Deep space nine : companion |last=Erdmann |first=Terry |authorlink= |author2=Paula M. Block  |year=2000 |publisher=Simon and Schuster |location= |isbn= |page30= |pages= |url= |accessdate=}}</ref> It was also difficult to decide how to introduce Q into ''Voyager'', as it was necessary to explain why Q did not return the ship to Federation territory.<ref>{{cite book |title=The Trekker's guide to Voyager: complete, unauthorized, and uncensored |last=Schuster |first=Hal |authorlink= |year=1996 |publisher=Prima Pub |location= |isbn=9780761505723 |page= |pages= |url= |accessdate=}}</ref>\n* Although appearing in only five episodes of ''The Next Generation'' and six episodes of ''Voyager'', the character of [[Reginald Barclay]] became quite pivotal to the story-arc of the final season of ''Voyager'', significantly contributing to the reestablishment of contact between the ship ''Voyager'' and the Federation. Barclay also appears in a cameo role in the eighth movie in the film series, ''[[Star Trek: First Contact]]''.\n* Three Klingon characters from separate individual episodes of the original series, Kor, Koloth and Kang, all appear in the ''Deep Space Nine'' episode \"[[Blood Oath (Star Trek: Deep Space Nine)|Blood Oath]]\", and Kor further appeared in ''DS9'' episodes \"[[The Sword of Kahless]]\" and \"[[Once More Unto the Breach (Star Trek: Deep Space Nine)|Once More Unto the Breach]]\". Crew members who worked on \"Blood Oath\" felt that a \"special connection\" was being made to the original series.<ref>{{cite book |title= Star trek, where no one has gone before: a history in pictures |last=Dillard |first=J.M. |authorlink= |author2=[[Susan Sackett]]  |year=1996 |publisher=Pocket Books |location= |isbn=9780671002060 |page=186 |pages= |url= |accessdate=}}</ref> Kang made an additional cameo appearance on ''Voyager'', verbally dueling with Captain Sulu in a brief scene of the episode \"Flashback\".\n* The two [[Ferengi]], Arridor and Kol, were minor characters in the ''TNG'' episode \"[[The Price (Star Trek: The Next Generation)|The Price]]\" but were the principal antagonists in the ''Voyager'' episode \"[[False Profits]]\".\n* The menacing [[Borg (Star Trek)|Borg]] race appeared in four out of six of the ''Trek'' series. Introduced in ''The Next Generation'', they would appear in ''Deep Space Nine'', ''Voyager'' and ''Enterprise''. Their role in ''Deep Space Nine'' was limited to an appearance in the premiere episode to explore Benjamin Sisko's troubled past (his wife having been killed in a major confrontation with the Borg), while their role in the ''Enterprise'' episode \"[[Regeneration (Star Trek: Enterprise)|Regeneration]]\" served as a 'sequel' to ''Star Trek: First Contact'', as an archaeological expedition discovers the remains of the time-travelling Borg sphere that was destroyed in ''First Contact'' and unwittingly reactivate a pair of Borg drones. However, the Borg became a recurring threat on ''Voyager''. The only crossover character was the [[Borg (Star Trek)#Borg Queen|Borg Queen]] first introduced in the ''Next Generation'' feature film ''Star Trek: First Contact''. She would then become a recurring character on ''Voyager'' appearing in the two-part episodes \"Dark Frontier\" and \"Unimatrix Zero\" and in the series finale \"Endgame\". These episodes form a narrative thread in which the Borg Queen is battling with Janeway in attempts to re-assimilate [[Seven of Nine]].<ref>{{cite book |title=American science fiction tv: Star Trek, Stargate and beyond |last=Johnson-Smith |first=Jan |authorlink= |year=2005 |publisher=I.B.Tauris |location= |isbn=9781860648823 |page=88 |pages= |url= |accessdate=}}</ref> Only in the final ''Voyager'' episode is the Borg Queen played by the same actress who played her in the feature film ''Star Trek: First Contact'', [[Alice Krige]].

A recast [[Sarek]], a recasting of Spock's mother Amanda ([[Mia Kirschner)]], and a recast Captain Pike also appears in [[Star Trek (2009)|''Star Trek'' (2009)'']].

This included appearances of established characters on premiere episodes of new series, a few long-term transfers from one series to another, and even crossovers between ''Trek'' films and television. A few crossover appearances, such as that of [[Spock]] on ''[[Star Trek: The Next Generation|The Next Generation]]'' and the time-travel of the crew of ''[[Star Trek: Deep Space Nine|Deep Space Nine]]'' to the era of ''[[Star Trek: The Original Series|The Original Series]]'' were especially lauded by both fans and critics.\n\n==Appearances in series premieres==\nAfter the original series, a character from an earlier series appeared in the premiere episode of each new series. These were the appearances of [[Leonard McCoy]] in \"[[Encounter at Farpoint]]\", the first episode of ''The Next Generation''; that of Captain [[Jean-Luc Picard]] in \"[[Emissary (Star Trek: Deep Space Nine)|Emissary]]\", the first episode of ''Deep Space Nine''; [[Quark (Star Trek)|Quark]] and [[Morn]] in \"[[Caretaker (Star Trek: Voyager)|Caretaker]]\", the premiere of ''Voyager''; [[Zefram Cochrane]] (from the original series episode \"[[Metamorphosis (Star Trek: The Original Series)|Metamorphosis]]\" and the film ''[[Star Trek: First Contact]]'') in \"[[Broken Bow (Star Trek: Enterprise)|Broken Bow]]\", the premiere of ''Enterprise''; and [[Sarek]] in \"[[The Vulcan Hello]]\", the first episode of ''Discovery''.\n\n==Long-term transitions==\nTwo long-term transitions were the transfer of [[Worf]] and [[Miles O'Brien (Star Trek)|Miles O'Brien]] from permanent characters on ''The Next Generation'' to permanent characters on ''Deep Space Nine''. Worf stayed on ''The Next Generation'' until its conclusion, then transferred from the start of season 4 of ''DS9''. Chief O'Brien had appeared in fifty episodes of ''The Next Generation'', but only gained opening credits billing on ''DS9'', in which he appeared in almost every episode of all seven seasons. While not seen as often as Chief O'Brien, his wife [[Keiko O'Brien]] also transitioned as a series regular guest star from ''The Next Generation'' to ''Deep Space Nine'', bringing their daughter [[Molly O'Brien|Molly]]. Miles O'Brien reprised his ''Next Generation'' role in that series' finale \"[[All Good Things... (Star Trek: The Next Generation)|All Good Things...]]\".\n\n==Episodes and films focused on crossovers==\n\n===Television-to-television crossover===\n\nAn especially significant crossover is Spock's appearance on the two-part ''Next Generation'' episode \"[[Unification (Star Trek: The Next Generation)|Unification]]\". Spock meets Data and they exchange opinions on the relative value of logic and emotion, and share mutual impressions of ''Next Generation''{{'}}s Captain Picard (who for Spock is a model of logical behavior, and for Data is a model of what it means to be human). Critics such as Ina Rae Hark have noted this encounter between two non-human characters summarizes their contrasting attitudes to humanity, Data embodying Spock's ideal of pure logic, while Data aspires to be more human.<ref>{{cite book |title=Star Trek: BFI TV Classics |last=Hark |first=Ina Rae |authorlink= |year=2008 |publisher=MacMillan |location= |isbn=9781844572144 |page=64 |pages= |url= |accessdate=}}</ref>\n\n[[Scotty (Star Trek)|Scotty]] appears in TNG Season 6, Episode 4 \"[[Relics (Star Trek: The Next Generation)|Relics]]\".\n\nRecycled footage from the original series episode \"[[The Trouble with Tribbles]]\" is used extensively in ''Deep Space Nine''{{'}}s time-travel episode \"[[Trials and Tribble-ations]]\". In addition to extensive archival footage of cast from the original series, actor [[Charlie Brill]] (portraying Klingon spy [[Arne Darvin]]) appears in both new and archival footage. The episode was designed to coincide with the 30th anniversary of the original series. Critic Matthew Kappell notes that the new episode simultaneously \"parodies and valorizes\" the original series, highlighting the discontinuities between two eras of ''Trek'' while trying simultaneously to weave them together.<ref>{{cite book |title=Star Trek as myth: essays on symbol and archetype at the final frontier |last=Kapell |first=Matthew Wilhelm |authorlink= |year=2010 |publisher=McFarland |location= |isbn=9780786447244 |page=83 |pages= |url= |accessdate=}}</ref>\n\nWilliam Riker and Deanna Troi from ''The Next Generation'' appear in a flash-forward to the future in \"[[These Are the Voyages...]]\", the final episode of ''Enterprise''. This episode was widely criticized by both cast members and fans for playing more like a ''Next Generation'' episode to the point of being an inappropriate wrap-up for the series.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://theedge.bostonherald.com/tvNews/view.bg?articleid=82256|archivedate=2006-03-18 | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20060318130122/http://theedge.bostonherald.com/tvNews/view.bg?articleid=82256|title=Jolene Blalock interview| work=[[Boston Herald]]|accessdate=2008-11-08}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|author=Salem, Rob|date=2005-05-09|title=Trek fatigued, producer admits. Enterprise limps off to oblivion |work=[[Toronto Star]]|page=E1}}</ref>\n\n===Film-to-television crossover===\n\nIn the ''Voyager'' episode \"[[Flashback (Star Trek: Voyager)|Flashback]]\", events from the film ''Star Trek VI: The Undiscovered Country'' (1991) play a pivotal role, and are re-enacted with  the same actors thus allowing George Takei to reprise his role as [[Hikaru Sulu]]. The episode contains the added revelation that the USS ''Voyager''{{'}}s [[Tuvok]] was on Sulu's ship ''Excelsior'' at the time. In bit of rather glaring discontinuity, the character of Lieutenant Dimitri Valtane, who appears in both the 1996 third season Voyager Episode and the 1991 feature film is shown to still be alive at the end of ''Undiscovered Country''. While that same character in the \"Flashback\" episode, is shown to have died prior to the feature films concluding scene in which the ''Excelsior'' crew bid farewell to the USS ''Enterprise'' crew. A scene from the film in which Valtane is visibly featured, and Tuvok is completely absent. Though the actor Tim Russ whom portrayed Tuvok, made an appearance as a Star Fleet bridge officer from the same fictional time period, serving on the [[USS ''Enterprise'' NCC-1701-B]] in the feature film [[''Star Trek Generations'']] (1994). Critic Lincoln Geraghty cites this as an example of ''Star Trek''{{'}}s ongoing propensity for reverential recognition of earlier versions of the series.<ref>{{cite book |title=Living with Star Trek: American culture and the Star Trek universe |last=Geraghty |first=Lincoln |authorlink= |year=2007 |publisher=I.B.Tauris |location= |isbn=9781845112653 |page=51 |pages= |url= |accessdate=}}</ref>\n\n===Television-to-film crossover===\n\nThe film ''[[Star Trek Generations]]'' brought Kirk and Picard, ''Enterprise'' captains from different centuries, together to defeat a common enemy. It also marked the passing of the film franchise from the original series cast to that of ''The Next Generation''.\n\n==Characters more prominent on subsequent series==\nA few occasional recurring characters introduced in one series continued into other series, sometimes attaining more significant roles in their subsequent ''Trek'' series than in the one in which they were first introduced:\n\n* Spock's father [[Sarek]] appeared in only one episode of the original series, but became a more developed character in three movies and ''[[Star Trek: Discovery]]'' and appeared in [[Sarek (Star Trek: The Next Generation)|the ''Next Generation'' episode named after him]] and the first part of \"Unification\". Sarek's appearance in the former is described in ''The Star Trek: The Next Generation Companion'' as \"the first major unifying event tying together the old and new Trek eras since McCoy's cameo\" in the original series.<ref>{{cite book |title=The Star Trek: The Next Generation Companion: Revised Edition |last=Nemecek |first=Larry |authorlink= |year=2003 |publisher=Simon and Schuster |location= |isbn=9780743457989 |page=127 |pages= |url= |accessdate=}}</ref>\n* Recurring character [[Q (Star Trek)|Q]], originally introduced in the premiere episode of ''Next Generation'', continued to appear in episodes of ''Deep Space Nine'' and ''Voyager''. Teleplay writer Robert Wolfe found it difficult to incorporate Q into the ''DS9'' universe as the character had been conceived so much as a foil for Captain Picard. He eventually decided to use Q to show personality differences between Picard and Sisko.<ref>{{cite book |title=Star trek: Deep space nine : companion |last=Erdmann |first=Terry |authorlink= |author2=Paula M.

Barclay also appears in a cameo role in the eighth movie in the film series, ''[[Star Trek: First Contact]]''.\n* Three Klingon characters from separate individual episodes of the original series, Kor, Koloth and Kang, all appear in the ''Deep Space Nine'' episode \"[[Blood Oath (Star Trek: Deep Space Nine)|Blood Oath]]\", and Kor further appeared in ''DS9'' episodes \"[[The Sword of Kahless]]\" and \"[[Once More Unto the Breach (Star Trek: Deep Space Nine)|Once More Unto the Breach]]\". Crew members who worked on \"Blood Oath\" felt that a \"special connection\" was being made to the original series.<ref>{{cite book |title= Star trek, where no one has gone before: a history in pictures |last=Dillard |first=J.M. |authorlink= |author2=[[Susan Sackett]]  |year=1996 |publisher=Pocket Books |location= |isbn=9780671002060 |page=186 |pages= |url= |accessdate=}}</ref> Kang made an additional cameo appearance on ''Voyager'', verbally dueling with Captain Sulu in a brief scene of the episode \"Flashback\".\n* The two [[Ferengi]], Arridor and Kol, were minor characters in the ''TNG'' episode \"[[The Price (Star Trek: The Next Generation)|The Price]]\" but were the principal antagonists in the ''Voyager'' episode \"[[False Profits]]\".\n* The menacing [[Borg (Star Trek)|Borg]] race appeared in four out of six of the ''Trek'' series. Introduced in ''The Next Generation'', they would appear in ''Deep Space Nine'', ''Voyager'' and ''Enterprise''. Their role in ''Deep Space Nine'' was limited to an appearance in the premiere episode to explore Benjamin Sisko's troubled past (his wife having been killed in a major confrontation with the Borg), while their role in the ''Enterprise'' episode \"[[Regeneration (Star Trek: Enterprise)|Regeneration]]\" served as a 'sequel' to ''Star Trek: First Contact'', as an archaeological expedition discovers the remains of the time-travelling Borg sphere that was destroyed in ''First Contact'' and unwittingly reactivate a pair of Borg drones. However, the Borg became a recurring threat on ''Voyager''. The only crossover character was the [[Borg (Star Trek)#Borg Queen|Borg Queen]] first introduced in the ''Next Generation'' feature film ''Star Trek: First Contact''. She would then become a recurring character on ''Voyager'' appearing in the two-part episodes \"Dark Frontier\" and \"Unimatrix Zero\" and in the series finale \"Endgame\". These episodes form a narrative thread in which the Borg Queen is battling with Janeway in attempts to re-assimilate [[Seven of Nine]].<ref>{{cite book |title=American science fiction tv: Star Trek, Stargate and beyond |last=Johnson-Smith |first=Jan |authorlink= |year=2005 |publisher=I.B.Tauris |location= |isbn=9781860648823 |page=88 |pages= |url= |accessdate=}}</ref> Only in the final ''Voyager'' episode is the Borg Queen played by the same actress who played her in the feature film ''Star Trek: First Contact'', [[Alice Krige]].

After reading the Manifesto, Russell answered a barrage of questions from members of the press, some of whom were initially openly hostile to the ideas contained in the Manifesto.

Emphasis was placed on the meeting being politically neutral. It extended the question of nuclear weapons to all people and governments. One particular phrase is quoted often, including by Rotblat upon receipt of the [[Nobel Peace Prize]] in 1995:<ref>{{cite book |last=Russell |first=Bertrand |title=The Collected Papers of Bertrand Russell: Man's Peril, 1954-55 |publisher=Routledge |edition= |location=London |date=2003 |isbn=978-0-415-09424-5}}</ref>\n\n{{Quote|Remember your humanity, and forget the rest.}}\n\n==The beginnings of the Pugwash Conferences==\nThe manifesto called for an international conference, and was originally planned by [[Jawaharlal Nehru]] to be held in [[India]]. This was delayed by the outbreak of the [[Suez Crisis]]. [[Aristotle Onassis]] offered to finance a meeting in [[Monaco]], but this was rejected. Instead, Cyrus Eaton, a Canadian industrialist who had known Russell since 1938, offered to finance the conference in his hometown of Pugwash, Nova Scotia. The '''Russell\u2013Einstein Manifesto''' became the [[Pugwash Conferences]]' founding charter. The first of the conferences was held in July 1957 in London.<ref>{{Citation |last=Butcher |first=Sandra Ionno |title=The Origins of the Russell-Einstein Manifesto |journal=Pugwash History Series |volume=1 |pages=1\u201335 |date=May 2005}}</ref>\n\n==Signatories to the manifesto==\n{{columns-list|colwidth=22em|\n* [[Max Born]]\n* [[Percy W.

Gradually, however, they became convinced by the forcefulness of his arguments, as was evident in the excellent reporting in the Press, which in many cases gave front page coverage.}}\n\nRussell had begun the conference by stating:<ref name=\"pugwash\"/>\n\n{{Quote|I am bringing the warning pronounced by the signatories to the notice of all the powerful Governments of the world in the earnest hope that they may agree to allow their citizens to survive.}}\n\n==Synopsis==\nThe manifesto called for a conference where scientists would assess the dangers posed to the survival of humanity by [[weapons of mass destruction]]. Emphasis was placed on the meeting being politically neutral. It extended the question of nuclear weapons to all people and governments. One particular phrase is quoted often, including by Rotblat upon receipt of the [[Nobel Peace Prize]] in 1995:<ref>{{cite book | last =  Russell| first = Bertrand | title = The Collected Papers of Bertrand Russell: Man's Peril, 1954-55 | publisher = Routledge | edition =  | location = London | date = 2003 | isbn = 9780415094245}}</ref>\n\n{{Quote|Remember your humanity, and forget the rest.}}\n\n==The beginnings of the Pugwash Conferences==\nThe manifesto called for an international conference, and was originally planned by [[Jawaharlal Nehru]] to be held in [[India]]. This was delayed by the outbreak of the [[Suez Crisis]]. [[Aristotle Onassis]] offered to finance a meeting in [[Monaco]], but this was rejected. Instead, Cyrus Eaton, a Canadian industrialist who had known Russell since 1938, offered to finance the conference in his hometown of Pugwash, Nova Scotia. The '''Russell\u2013Einstein Manifesto''' became the [[Pugwash Conferences]]' founding charter. The first of the conferences was held in July 1957 in London.<ref>{{Citation | last =  Butcher| first = Sandra Ionno | title =  The Origins of the Russell-Einstein Manifesto| journal = Pugwash History Series | volume = 1 | pages = 1\u201335 | date = May 2005 }}</ref>\n\n==Signatories to the manifesto==\n{{columns-list|colwidth=22em|\n* [[Max Born]]\n* [[Percy W.
