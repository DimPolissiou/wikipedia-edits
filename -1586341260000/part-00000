[[George Bailey (It's a Wonderful Life)|George Bailey]]'s story is also Capra's, and Ford's, and Wyler's.

Eight of the sold companies would be reacquired when Coach America declared bankruptcy in 2012, along with Lakefront/Hopkins in Ohio, with the intent of expanding (and in the case of California, reintroducing) the Megabus brand.\n\nCoach USA's operations today consist primarily of scheduled services in the [[New York metropolitan area|New York]] and [[Chicago metropolitan area]]s, with a number of charter operations near [[Pittsburgh]] and scheduled operations in the [[Southern Tier]] of New York and southern [[Wisconsin]], along with its Megabus operations throughout the eastern and central United States. In December 2018 Stagecoach announced it had agreed to sell all of its North American operations to Variant Equity Advisors subsidiary Project Kenwood Acquisition with the deal concluded in April 2019.<ref>[https://www.stagecoach.com/media/news-releases/2018/2018-12-19.aspx Sale of North America Division for Estimated Enterprise Value of US$271M] Stagecoach December 19, 2018</ref><ref>[https://cbwmagazine.com/stagecoach-sells-off-north-american-division-for-271m/ Stagecoach sells off North American division for $271m] ''[[Coach & Bus Week]]'' December 21, 2018</ref><ref>Stagecoach agrees to sell Coach USA ''[[Buses (magazine)|Buses]]'' issue 767 February 2019 page 6</ref><ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20190418100920/http://otp.investis.com/clients/uk/stagecoach/rns/regulatory-story.aspx?cid=273&newsid=1253284 Completion of North America sale] Stagecoach April 16, 2019</ref>\n\n==Operating companies==\n{{as of|October 2016}}, Coach USA includes the following local operating companies, along with intercity operator [[Megabus (North America)|Megabus]]:<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.coachusa.com/ftr.contactus.asp|title=Contact Us|author=Coach USA|accessdate=October 1, 2016}}</ref>\n\n*American Coach Lines of Atlanta (Atlanta, GA)<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.americancoachofatlanta.com/our-company/|title=Our company|author=American Coach Lines of Atlanta|accessdate=October 1, 2016}}</ref><ref name=\"fed\"/>\n*All West Coachlines (Sacramento, CA / Reno, NV)<ref name=\"fed\"/>\n*Butler Motor Transit (Butler, PA)\n*Central Cab Company (Waynesburg, PA)\n*[[Chicago Trolley & Double Decker Co.]] (Chicago, IL)\n*[[Coach Canada]] (Toronto, ON)\n*Coach Erie (Erie, PA)\n*Coach USA Elko (Elko, NV)<ref name=\"fed\"/>\n*[[Community Coach]] (Paramus, NJ)\n*Country Road Tours (Clarksburg, WV)\n*Dillon's Bus Service (Hanover, MD)<ref name=\"fed\"/>\n*Gad-About Tours (Pittsburgh, PA)\n*[[Gray Line Montreal]] (Montreal, QC)\n*[[Gray Line Worldwide|Gray Line]] New York Sightseeing (New York, NY)\n*Kerrville Bus Company (San Antonio, TX)<ref name=\"fed\"/>\n*Lakefront Lines (Brookpark, OH)<ref name=\"fed\">{{Cite web| title = Stagecoach Group plc and Coach USA, Inc., et al.-Acquisition of Control of Assets-American Coach Lines of Atlanta, Inc.; CUSA AT, LLC; CUSA AWC, LLC; CUSA ELKO, LLC; CUSA, KBC, LLC; CUSA PCSTC, LLC; CUSA PRTS, LLC; CUSA RAZ, LLC; Dillon's Bus Service, Inc.; and Lakefront Lines, Inc.| work = Federal Register| accessdate = 2016-12-29| date = 2012-06-22| url = https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2012/06/22/2012-15287/stagecoach-group-plc-and-coach-usa-inc-et-al-acquisition-of-control-of-assets-american-coach-lines}}</ref>\n*Lenzner Coach Lines (Sewickley, PA)\n*Mountaineer Coach (Beaver, WV)\n*[[Olympia Trails]] (Elizabeth, NJ)\n*Park Tours (Parkersburg, WV)\n*Powder River Transportion (Gillette, WY)<ref name=\"fed\"/>\n*[[Rockland Coaches]] (Westwood, NJ)\n*[[Short Line Bus]] (Chester, NY)\n*Pacific Coast Sightseeing Tour and Charters (Anaheim, CA)<ref name=\"fed\"/><ref>[http://www.ocregister.com/articles/union-703061-coach-company.html Coach USA bus drivers, mechanics vote against joining union, 118 to 73]</ref>\n*[[Suburban Transit]] (New Brunswick, NJ)\n*Van Galder Bus Company (Janesville, WI)\n*Wisconsin Coach Lines (Waukesha, WI)\n\n==Megabus==\n{{main|Megabus (North America)}}\n[[Megabus (North America)|Megabus]] is an intercity bus service providing discount travel services since 2006, operating throughout the eastern, southern, midwestern, and western United States and in the Canadian provinces of Ontario and Quebec.
