Zipperer and his younger brother Max grew up in the immediate vicinity of [[Ulm Minster]]. After his schooling in Ulm from 1894 to 1902, at his father\u2019s request, he followed in his footsteps and trained as a saddler and upholsterer. After passing his journeyman's examination in 1905 and working both in the family business and for a time for another employer, he followed his inclination for art and attended the arts and crafts school in [[Hanover]] from 1907 to 1909. He then transferred to Paul Heinrich\u2019s academy in [[Hildburghausen]] for further qualification (1909 \u2013 1910). From October 1910 to November 1911, he did his military service as a volunteer in [[Neu-Ulm]]. He then attended the arts and crafts school in [[Kassel]] where he obtained a qualification as drawing teacher for secondary schools and teacher training institutions (1911 \u2013 1913). Following that, he attended the [[Academy of Fine Arts, Munich|Academy of Fine Arts in Munich]] for one term as a student of [[Heinrich W\u00f6lfflin]].<ref>''Der Maler auf der Tannenburg''. In: Haller Tagblatt. Schw\u00e4bisch Hall. No. 226, 30.9.1961.</ref> In March 1914, Ernst Zipperer took up his first post as trainee drawing teacher at [[Lichterfelde (Berlin)|Berlin-Lichterfelde]] Grammar School. However, this was interrupted due to being drafted into war service in [[Masuria]], [[East Prussia]] in August 1914.\n\nIn [[World War I]], Ernst Zipperer served as an officer. He was seriously wounded near [[Minsk]] in Russia in 1915 due to a head shot and lost his left eye. As a consequence, he underwent treatment at the Eye Hospital in Stuttgart for a period of one year. As a result of his injuries, he suffered from severe headaches and spells of dizziness as well as kidney problems for the rest of his life.\n\nIn June 1917, he returned to Berlin-Lichterfelde Grammar School and qualified as drawing teacher in September. From October 1917 to September 1918, he served as district officer in [[Rastenburg]] in [[East Prussia]].\n\n=== Berlin ===\nIn 1918, Ernst Zipperer married Elisabeth Nestler (* November 3, 1894 in [[Hildburghausen]], \u2020 June 5, 1977 in [[Heilbronn]]). Following their wedding, he took up the post of art teacher at [[Hermann von Helmholtz]] Grammar School in Berlin-Sch\u00f6nefeld. The couple had three children: Ernst Wilhelm (1919 \u2013 2005), Gisela (1921 \u2013 1928) and Vera Charlotte (*1931). In 1920, he moved to [[Friedenau|Berlin-Friedenau]] Grammar School where he taught until 1940. There, until 1940, he influenced a whole generation of young people. His pupils included persons such as the resistance fighter Friedrich Justus Perels, the columnist Friedrich Luft and the politicians [[Egon Bahr]] and [[Peter Lorenz]]. Zipperer was deeply respected by his pupils and many remained in close contact with him until his death. He enjoyed a deep friendship with Helmut Ammann who became a prominent sculptor, painter and graphic artist.\n\nErnst Zipperer\u2019s first years of teaching in Berlin also marked the beginning of his first major creative phase which lasted until 1940. During these two decades, Zipperer produced a significant body of work. He traveled extensively throughout Germany and to various European countries in order to study and produce art works. His preferred technique at the time was [[drypoint]] etching and with this technique he became known both in and outside Germany. [[File:Ernst_Zipperer-Ernst_Hermann_Zipperer.jpg|thumb|220x220px|''Ernst Hermann Zipperer'' (father), pastel, 1913]]\nIn Berlin, Zipperer developed friendships with the artists [[Heinrich Zille]] and [[Max Liebermann]].<ref name=\":1\">''\u201aDer Weg\u2018 - Vision und Auftrag, Ernst Zipperer zum 80. Geburtstag.'' In: Haller Tagblatt. Schw\u00e4bisch Hall. Febrary 23,1968, p. 9.</ref> He was particularly close to the scultor [[August Gaul]], in whose house he lived for almost one year in 1917. Gaul appreciated and sponsored Ernst Zipperer. Through Gaul, a member of the Executive Committee of the [[Berlin Secession]], Zipperer came into contact with Berlin arts world.  \n[[File:Tannenburg_130508.jpg|alt=Tannenburg bei B\u00fchlertann|left|thumb|160x160px|Tannenburg near B\u00fchlertann]]\nIn 1931, Zipperer bought Tannenburg Castle, a castle dating back to the [[Hohenstaufen|Staufer]] period, with its farm estate near the village of [[B\u00fchlertann]] in [[Ellwangen]] District (now [[Schw\u00e4bisch Hall]] District) in north-east [[W\u00fcrttemberg]].<ref>Klein, Erwin/Staudacher, Bernhard: ''Die Geschichte der Tannenburg und ihrer Besitzer.''

B\u00fchlertann: Heimatverein. 2010.</ref> He leased the associated farm estate and continued to work in Berlin.\n\n=== Tannenburg and B\u00fchlertann, W\u00fcrttemberg ===\nAs a [[Disability|disabled]] war veteran, Ernst Zipperer retired from teaching in 1940 and moved from [[Berlin Tegel Airport|Berlin t]]<nowiki/>o Tannenburg Castle. Under extremely difficult conditions, he managed the farm estate until the return of his son Ernst Wilhelm from the war and captivity (1940 \u2013 1948). In 1951, he handed over the castle and the farm estate to his son and, in 1963, left the castle to move to the home of his daughter Vera in B\u00fchlertann. With the deterioration of his remaining eye\u2019s sight, he had to give up his artistic work in 1972. He spent the last years of his life at the home of his daughter who had since moved to [[Flein]] near [[Heilbronn]]. Ernst Gustav Zipperer died on May 26, 1982 at the age of 94 and was buried in [[B\u00fchlertann]].[[File:Ernst_Zipperer-Tannenburg.jpg|alt=|thumb|216x216px|''Tannenburg'', Drypoint, 1940]]\n\n== Work ==\nThe artistic work of Ernst Zipperer covers his early work until 1918, the creative phase in Berlin (1918-1940) and his late work (1950-1972). According to the current status, about 1,300 works have been documented.\n\n=== Early work (until 1917) ===\nAlready as a child and during his apprenticeship, Ernst Zipperer showed a particular talent for drawing. During this period, many drawings and sketches evolved, but most of them are now lost. From the period of his artistic education in Hanover, Kassel and Munich, numerous studies on [[Perspective (graphical)|perspective]] and shadowing as well as [[technical drawing]]s still exist.\n\nUnder the influence of Prof. Heubach<ref>''Kunstausstellung im Kunsthaus G\u00f6bel''. In: Ulmer Tagblatt. Ulm. No. 87, April 16, 1931.\n</ref> in Hanover Zipperer turned its attention to the drawing of [[architecture]]. At the same time he created [[landscape]]s, [[Portrait|portraits,]] [[Nudity in art|nudes]], [[Ornament (art)|ornaments]] and [[still life]]s, which he mainly executed as [[Drawing|pencil drawings,]] rarely as [[Watercolor painting|watercolors]].\n\nDuring his wartime deployment in Russia (1914 \u2013 1915), his artistic talent expressed itself in a wide variety of ways. Due to a lack of photographic resources, he sketched military combats which were used in connection with strategic decisions. In the [[Trench warfare|trenches]], he sketched portraits of fellow soldiers and officers as a memento to be sent to their families. Two small drawings from this period are extant.\n\nHis severe war injury was followed by a one-year convalescence period at the Eye Hospital in [[Stuttgart]]. After regaining the sight of his remaining eye, he produced many art works, while still in hospital. In numerous sketches and drawings, he focused on people who showed considerable signs of what they had gone through during the war. Some pictures of that time clearly show the influence of [[Heinrich Zille]].<ref>Rieber, A.: ''Heute f\u00fchren die Wege ins Unendliche''. In: Heilbronner Stimme. Heilbronn. March 3, 1973, p. 21.</ref>\n\n=== Berlin Phase (1918 \u2013 1940) ===\n[[File:Ernst_Zipperer-Magdalen_Tower_Oxford.jpg|thumb|211x211px|''Magdalen Tower, Oxford'', Drypoint, 1925]]\nIn 1919 Ernst Zipperer discovered [[drypoint]] [[etching]] for himself. He drew and etched castles, city views, churches, landscapes, portraits, flowers and animals - mostly in small to medium format. The main topic in this phase was [[architecture]]. He found more than 40 motifs alone in his hometown of [[Ulm]]. On his numerous travels he made pencil drawings as preliminary studies for the later etchings.\n[[File:Ernst_Zipperer-Hohenrechberg_und_Hohenstaufen.jpg|thumb|160x160px|Swabian Alb with Hohenrechberg and Hohenstaufen, drypoint, 1925]]\nA total of more than 300 drypoint etchings were created, which were characterized by careful area division, well thought-out image composition and formal design ability. Added to this was the perspective effect of his pictures, which he succeeded convincingly despite one-eyed. Zipperer achieved an increase in spatiality and expression by drawing inspiration from [[Chiaroscuro]].<ref>''Zur Ausstellung von Radierungen Ernst Zipperers''. In: Ipf- und Jagst-zeitung / Ellwanger Tagblatt. Ellwangen. Vol 115 (1933), No. 237, October 28, 1933, p. 5.\n</ref> Also characteristic was the [[staffage]] found in many etchings, which discretly guides the eye of the beholder.  \n[[File:Ernst_Zipperer-Bahnhofshalle_Berlin.jpg|thumb|160x160px|Station Hall Berlin, drypoint, 1923]]\n\"The many moving strokes, which sometimes had an almost shimmering effect - combined with a strict mold design - that was typical Zipperer\".<ref>''Ausstellung im Kunsthaus Frey in Ulm zum 90. Geburtstag''. In: Ulmer Zeitung. Ulm. Febrary 11,1978.</ref> But he was not just concerned with the reproduction of reality. \"Zipperer did not represent dead objects, but things that have a destiny and therefore life.\"<ref>Ohne Titel. In: Vaterst\u00e4dtische Bl\u00e4tter. L\u00fcbeck. (1927/28), No.  3, October 30, 1927, p. 3f.</ref> Rather, he sought the creative translation of his perception into the artistic. \"He knew how to express what weaves the visible in emotional mood\".<ref>''Kunstverlag Carl B\u00fcchle''. Berlin-Tempelhof 1925 [publisher's catalog].</ref>\n\nThat Zipperer was also \"a portrait drypoint etcher of rank and depth\"<ref>''Bilder aus Heimat und Welt.'' In: Sonntagsbeitr\u00e4ge der Weser-Zeitung. Bremen. November 27, 1927.</ref> is shown by his portraits, which he executed as pencil drawings and etchings. During training in [[Kassel]] he had received an award for portrait drawing.\n\nIn the mid-twenties, Zipperer occasionally colored etchings by hand. As towards the end of the decade increasingly colored etchings were required, he had many of his motifs in color print.\n\nNumerous etchings were commissioned by cities, companies, art dealers or private individuals. A large part of the etchings was published by various publishers as art cards and sold through the art trade.\n\nZipperer worked for decades with the copper printing company Wilhelm Schneider in Berlin, where the [[Etching|copper plates]] were stored. A larger number of plates were lost during the Second World War and in the subsequent turmoil or got into unauthorized hands. This explains that pirate prints came into circulation as a result.\n\nWith his drypoint etchings Ernst Zipperer became known in Europe and America - less by exhibitions than by the very successful distribution of his pictures by some art publishers and numerous art shops in Germany and abroad.<ref group=\"A\">Copperplate printing company, art publishers and art dealers (selection):\n\nKupferdruckerei und Kunstverlag Wilhelm Schneider & Co, Berlin  /  Kunstverlag Balkheimer, Ulm (K\u00fcnstlerkarten)  /  Kunstverlag J.C.

Also some sketches in different techniques, which served for demonstration purposes in the classroom, are preserved from this time.\n\nErnst Zipperer\u2019s wife Elisabeth contributed considerably to his work since she kept him free from the burden of day-to-day activities. She handled business correspondence with the copperplate printers, art dealers and prospective buyers. Likewise, she helped to organize the countless visits of art lovers.\n\n=== Creative break (1941 \u2013 1949) ===\nDuring World War II and the immediately succeeding years, Ernst Zipperer\u2019s artistic activities almost came to a complete stop. The difficult conditions of everyday life at the castle left no scope for art.\n\n=== Late work (1950 \u2013 1972) ===\nAfter the turmoil of the war and the handover of Tannenburg to his son, Ernst Zipperer was able to devote himself entirely to his art. He left the era of drypoint behind him and entered a new intense phase of artistic creation. The late work of the artist is characterized by experimentation and new ideas. For Zipperer, the movement runs along the art-historical development of his time from realistic-naturalistic to [[Abstract art|abstract]]-reductionist representation. At the same time, the realistic and abstract modes of expression do not stand for a closed stage of artistic recognition. Rather, both exist side by side. Abstract depictions are again followed by a landscape or a bouquet of flowers.<ref name=\":1\" /> He is always looking for \"ground under his feet,\" as he called it.<ref name=\":2\">''Jedes Bild ist ein Wettlauf mit der Sonne''. In: Haller Tagblatt. Schw\u00e4bisch Hall.

Schw\u00e4bisch Hall. April 22, 1972, p. 20.</ref> In many cases, these are already well-known motifs that recur again and again - often in a reduced form - trees in the landscape, a ravine and clouds above; especially the clouds occupied him throughout his life.<ref name=\":0\">''Der Maler auf der Tannenburg''. In: Haller Tagblatt. Schw\u00e4bisch Hall. No. 226, September 30, 1961.</ref> In addition, there are themes such as ''peace'' and ''quiet'', but also ''division'' and ''destruction'', which he translates abstractly.<ref name=\":2\" /> \"Everything you can think of, you can also draw\", the artist described his own spectrum in later years.<ref>''Die Tannenburg \u2013 eine Trutzveste aus der Stauferzeit''. In: Haller Tagblatt. Schw\u00e4bisch Hall. May 14, 1966, p. 8f.\n</ref>\n\nIncreasingly employed Ernst Zipperer, who was influenced [[Protestantism|Protestant]] in the parental home, but in his old age increasingly took up [[Catholic Church|Catholic]] thought, religious and [[Bible|biblical]] themes: The [[Psalms]], the [[Creation myth|story of creation]], [[Job (biblical figure)|Job]] and the [[Gospel of John]]. He also transformed the music of [[Johann Sebastian Bach|Bach]], [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart|Mozart]] and [[Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky|Tchaikovsky]] into colors and forms.<gallery>\nFile:Ernst Zipperer-Ohne Titel.jpg|Before God, all men are equal, oil pastels, 1959\nFile:Ernst Zipperer-Der alte Mensch in der neuen Welt.jpg|The old man in the new world, oil pastels, 1967\nFile:Ernst Zipperer-Himmel und Erde.jpg|Heaven and earth, oil pastels, 1965\nFile:Ernst Zipperer-Entfaltung.jpg|Unfolding, oil pastels, 1965\nFile:Ernst Zipperer-Entwicklung.jpg|Development, pastel, 1967\nFile:Ernst Zipperer-Landschaft.jpg|Landscape, pastel, 1964\n</gallery>\n\n[[File:Ernst_Zipperer-Zwiegespraech.jpg|thumb|166x166px|Dialogue, Heliogravure, 1958]]\nErnst Zipperer found in [[pastel]] and [[oil pastel]]s, but also in [[tempera]] and [[Oil painting|oil paint]] adequate materials to express his imagination and his mystical inwardness - sometimes cautious-mindful, then again powerful-dynamic.\n\nIn the gravure printing of the [[Photogravure|heliogravure]] Zipperer did in 1955 in cooperation with his Berlin printing on new ways on how he could spread some of his large-sized pastel paintings in large numbers. It is a fine-printing process that transfers the original to a copper plate in a complex photo-chemical process. The heliogravure makes a very differentiated reproduction of [[halftone]]s possible and thus creates a wealth of color power. The prints, also known as hand copper, met with great interest in the art trade and in the personal environment of the artist. They were affordable, allowing a wider audience access to this art.\n\nThere is not a single [[self-portrait]] by Ernst Zipperer. However, he draws a picture especially in his late works: In it he shows how he sees the visible and invisible world with his inner eye.\n\nIn addition to some extensive, there are many smaller [[private collection]]s with works by Ernst Zipperer. Individual works are held in German museums or municipal archives. Ernst Zipperer\u2019s artistic estate is managed by his daughter Vera Prior and grandson Lothar Zipperer.\n\n== Exhibitions (selection) ==\nOktober 1927 in Offenburg, ''Die Kunstausstellung im B\u00fcrgersaal'', Offenburger Zeitung, October 15, 1927\n\n1927 in Braunschweig, ''Kunstgewerbemesse Elisabeth Osterloh''\n\nOktober 1929, ''Der Radierer Ernst Zipperer,'' Buchhandlung der Soldiner Zeitung, October 3, 1929\n\nApril 1931 in Ulm, ''Zipperer-Ausstellung im Kunsthaus G\u00f6bel,'' Ulmer Tagblatt, April 16, 1931\n\nSeptember 1931, Ausstellung von Zipperer-Radierungen in der Kunsthandlung Karl Balkheimer, Ulm\n\nOctober 1933 in Ellwangen, ''Zur Ausstellung von Radierungen Ernst Zipperers'', Ipf- und Jagstzeitung / Ellwanger Tagblatt, Oktober 28, 1933\n\nJuly 1963 in Ellwangen, ''Ausstellung im Bilderhaus Alois Raible'', Aalener Volkszeitung/Ipf- und Jagstzeitung, July 6, 1963\n\nApril 1972 in B\u00fchlertann, ''Ein Stiller im Lande'', Kreissparkasse B\u00fchlertann, Haller Tagblatt, April 22, 1972\n\nFebrary 1978 in Ulm, ''Ulmer Motive \u2013 ins K\u00fcnstlerische \u00fcbersetzt'', Ausstellung im Kunsthaus Frey, Ulmer Zeitung, Febrary 11, 1978\n\nJune 2002 in B\u00fchlertann, Heimatverein B\u00fchlertann, Haller Tagblatt, June 28, 2002\n\nApril 2006 in Dresden, ''Villa Eschenbach zeigt allerlei Kunst um das Monet\u00e4re'', Leipziger Volkszeitung, April 24, 2006\n\nOctober 2010 in Nersingen-Oberfahlheim bei Ulm, ''Alte Ulmer Ansichten, Radierungen von Ernst Zipperer'', S\u00fcdwestpresse Ulm, October 15, 2010\n\nJunie 2013 in B\u00fchlertann, ''Ein\u00e4ugiger Blick auf die Heimat,'' Heimatverein B\u00fchlertann, Hohenloher Tagblatt, June 28, 2013\n\nJune 2016 in B\u00fchlertann, ''Zipperer-Werke im Rathaus'', Heimatverein B\u00fchlertann, Haller Tagblatt, June 23, 2016\n\nJuly 2018 in Schw\u00e4bisch Hall, ''Ernst Zipperer (1888 \u2013 1982) \u2013 Auf den Spuren seiner Kunst'', H\u00e4llisch-Fr\u00e4nkisches Museum Schw\u00e4bisch Hall, Haller Tagblatt, July 17, 2018\n\n== Bibliography ==\n\n=== Sources / Figures - chronological ===\n''Ernst Zipperer\u2019s personnel file''; Berlin-Friedenau Grammar School (01.10.1918 \u2013 31.03.1940).

Zipperer and his younger brother Max grew up in the immediate vicinity of [[Ulm Minster]]. After his schooling in Ulm from 1894 to 1902, at his father\u2019s request, he followed in his footsteps and trained as a saddler and upholsterer. After passing his journeyman's examination in 1905 and working both in the family business and for a time for another employer, he followed his inclination for art and attended the arts and crafts school in [[Hanover]] from 1907 to 1909. He then transferred to Paul Heinrich\u2019s academy in [[Hildburghausen]] for further qualification (1909 \u2013 1910). From October 1910 to November 1911, he did his military service as a volunteer in [[Neu-Ulm]]. He then attended the arts and crafts school in [[Kassel]] where he obtained a qualification as drawing teacher for secondary schools and teacher training institutions (1911 \u2013 1913). Following that, he attended the [[Academy of Fine Arts, Munich|Academy of Fine Arts in Munich]] for one term as a student of [[Heinrich W\u00f6lfflin]].<ref>''Der Maler auf der Tannenburg''. In: Haller Tagblatt. Schw\u00e4bisch Hall. No. 226, 30.9.1961.</ref> In March 1914, Ernst Zipperer took up his first post as trainee drawing teacher at [[Lichterfelde (Berlin)|Berlin-Lichterfelde]] Grammar School. However, this was interrupted due to being drafted into war service in [[Masuria|Masuria,]] [[East Prussia]] in August 1914.   \n\nIn [[World War I]], Ernst Zipperer served as an officer. He was seriously wounded near [[Minsk]] in Russia in 1915 due to a head shot and lost his left eye. As a consequence, he underwent treatment at the Eye Hospital in Stuttgart for a period of one year. As a result of his injuries, he suffered from severe headaches and spells of dizziness as well as kidney problems for the rest of his life.\n\nIn June 1917, he returned to Berlin-Lichterfelde Grammar School and qualified as drawing teacher in September. From October 1917 to September 1918, he served as district officer in [[Rastenburg]] in [[East Prussia]].\n=== Berlin ===\nIn 1918, Ernst Zipperer married Elisabeth Nestler (* November 3, 1894 in [[Hildburghausen|Hildburghausen,]] \u2020 June 5, 1977 in [[Heilbronn]]). Following their wedding, he took up the post of art teacher at [[Hermann von Helmholtz]] Grammar School in Berlin-Sch\u00f6nefeld. The couple had three children: Ernst Wilhelm (1919 \u2013 2005), Gisela (1921 \u2013 1928) and Vera Charlotte (*1931). In 1920, he moved to [[Friedenau|Berlin-Friedenau]] Grammar School where he taught until 1940. There, until 1940, he influenced a whole generation of young people. His pupils included persons such as the resistance fighter Friedrich Justus Perels, the columnist Friedrich Luft and the politicians [[Egon Bahr]] and [[Peter Lorenz]]. Zipperer was deeply respected by his pupils and many remained in close contact with him until his death. He enjoyed a deep friendship with Helmut Ammann who became a prominent sculptor, painter and graphic artist. \n\nErnst Zipperer\u2019s first years of teaching in Berlin also marked the beginning of his first major creative phase which lasted until 1940. During these two decades, Zipperer produced a significant body of work. He traveled extensively throughout Germany and to various European countries in order to study and produce art works. His preferred technique at the time was [[drypoint]] etching and with this technique he became known both in and outside Germany. [[File:Ernst_Zipperer-Ernst_Hermann_Zipperer.jpg|thumb|220x220px|''Ernst Hermann Zipperer'' (father), pastel, 1913]]\nIn Berlin, Zipperer developed friendships with the artists [[Heinrich Zille]] and [[Max Liebermann]].<ref name=\":1\">''\u201aDer Weg\u2018 - Vision und Auftrag, Ernst Zipperer zum 80. Geburtstag.'' In: Haller Tagblatt. Schw\u00e4bisch Hall. Febrary 23,1968, p. 9.</ref> He was particularly close to the scultor [[August Gaul]], in whose house he lived for almost one year in [[1917]]. Gaul appreciated and sponsored Ernst Zipperer. Through Gaul, a member of the Executive Committee of the [[Berlin Secession]], Zipperer came into contact with Berlin arts world.  \n[[File:Tannenburg_130508.jpg|alt=Tannenburg bei B\u00fchlertann|left|thumb|160x160px|Tannenburg near B\u00fchlertann]]\nIn 1931, Zipperer bought Tannenburg Castle, a castle dating back to the [[Hohenstaufen|Staufer]] period, with its farm estate near the village of [[B\u00fchlertann]] in [[Ellwangen]] District (now [[Schw\u00e4bisch Hall]] District) in north-east [[W\u00fcrttemberg]].<ref>Klein, Erwin/Staudacher, Bernhard: ''Die Geschichte der Tannenburg und ihrer Besitzer.''

B\u00fchlertann: Heimatverein. 2010.</ref> He leased the associated farm estate and continued to work in Berlin.    \n\n=== Tannenburg and B\u00fchlertann, W\u00fcrttemberg ===\nAs a [[Disability|disabled]] war veteran, Ernst Zipperer retired from teaching in 1940 and moved from [[Berlin Tegel Airport|Berlin t]]<nowiki/>o Tannenburg Castle. Under extremely difficult conditions, he managed the farm estate until the return of his son Ernst Wilhelm from the war and captivity (1940 \u2013 1948). In 1951, he handed over the castle and the farm estate to his son and, in 1963, left the castle to move to the home of his daughter Vera in B\u00fchlertann. With the deterioration of his remaining eye\u2019s sight, he had to give up his artistic work in 1972. He spent the last years of his life at the home of his daughter who had since moved to [[Flein]] near [[Heilbronn]]. Ernst Gustav Zipperer died on May 26, 1982 at the age of 94 and was buried in [[B\u00fchlertann|B\u00fchlertann.]][[File:Ernst_Zipperer-Tannenburg.jpg|alt=|thumb|216x216px|''Tannenburg'', Drypoint, 1940]]\n\n== Work ==\nThe artistic work of Ernst Zipperer covers his early work until 1918, the creative phase in Berlin (1918-1940) and his late work (1950-1972). According to the current status, about 1,300 works have been documented.\n\n=== Early work (until 1917) ===\nAlready as a child and during his apprenticeship, Ernst Zipperer showed a particular talent for drawing. During this period, many drawings and sketches evolved, but most of them are now lost. From the period of his artistic education in Hanover, Kassel and Munich, numerous studies on [[Perspective (graphical)|perspective]] and shadowing as well as [[Technical drawing|technical drawings]] still exist. \n\nUnder the influence of Prof. Heubach<ref>''Kunstausstellung im Kunsthaus G\u00f6bel''. In: Ulmer Tagblatt. Ulm. No. 87, April 16, 1931.\n</ref> in Hanover Zipperer turned its attention to the drawing of [[architecture]]. At the same time he created [[Landscape|landscapes]], [[Portrait|portraits,]] [[Nudity in art|nudes]], [[Ornament (art)|ornaments]] and [[Still life|still lifes]], which he mainly executed as [[Drawing|pencil drawings,]] rarely as [[Watercolor painting|watercolors]]. \n\nDuring his wartime deployment in Russia (1914 \u2013 1915), his artistic talent expressed itself in a wide variety of ways. Due to a lack of photographic resources, he sketched military combats which were used in connection with strategic decisions. In the [[Trench warfare|trenches]], he sketched portraits of fellow soldiers and officers as a memento to be sent to their families. Two small drawings from this period are extant.\n\nHis severe war injury was followed by a one-year convalescence period at the Eye Hospital in [[Stuttgart|Stuttgart.]] After regaining the sight of his remaining eye, he produced many art works, while still in hospital. In numerous sketches and drawings, he focused on people who showed considerable signs of what they had gone through during the war. Some pictures of that time clearly show the influence of [[Heinrich Zille]].<ref>Rieber, A.: ''Heute f\u00fchren die Wege ins Unendliche''. In: Heilbronner Stimme. Heilbronn. March 3, 1973, p. 21.</ref>\n\n=== Berlin Phase (1918 \u2013 1940) ===\n[[File:Ernst_Zipperer-Magdalen_Tower_Oxford.jpg|thumb|211x211px|''Magdalen Tower, Oxford'', Drypoint, 1925]]\nIn 1919 Ernst Zipperer discovered [[drypoint]] [[etching]] for himself. He drew and etched castles, city views, churches, landscapes, portraits, flowers and animals - mostly in small to medium format. The main topic in this phase was [[architecture]]. He found more than 40 motifs alone in his hometown of [[Ulm]]. On his numerous travels he made pencil drawings as preliminary studies for the later etchings.\n[[File:Ernst_Zipperer-Hohenrechberg_und_Hohenstaufen.jpg|thumb|160x160px|Swabian Alb with Hohenrechberg and Hohenstaufen, drypoint, 1925]]\nA total of more than 300 drypoint etchings were created, which were characterized by careful area division, well thought-out image composition and formal design ability. Added to this was the perspective effect of his pictures, which he succeeded convincingly despite one-eyed. Zipperer achieved an increase in spatiality and expression by drawing inspiration from [[Chiaroscuro]].<ref>''Zur Ausstellung von Radierungen Ernst Zipperers''. In: Ipf- und Jagst-zeitung / Ellwanger Tagblatt. Ellwangen. Vol 115 (1933), No. 237, October 28, 1933, p. 5.\n</ref> Also characteristic was the [[staffage]] found in many etchings, which discretly guides the eye of the beholder.  \n[[File:Ernst_Zipperer-Bahnhofshalle_Berlin.jpg|thumb|160x160px|Station Hall Berlin, drypoint, 1923]]\n\"The many moving strokes, which sometimes had an almost shimmering effect - combined with a strict mold design - that was typical Zipperer\".<ref>''Ausstellung im Kunsthaus Frey in Ulm zum 90. Geburtstag''. In: Ulmer Zeitung. Ulm. Febrary 11,1978.</ref> But he was not just concerned with the reproduction of reality. \"Zipperer did not represent dead objects, but things that have a destiny and therefore life.\"<ref>Ohne Titel. In: Vaterst\u00e4dtische Bl\u00e4tter. L\u00fcbeck. (1927/28), No.  3, October 30, 1927, p. 3f.</ref> Rather, he sought the creative translation of his perception into the artistic. \"He knew how to express what weaves the visible in emotional mood\".<ref>''Kunstverlag Carl B\u00fcchle''. Berlin-Tempelhof 1925 [publisher's catalog].</ref>\n\nThat Zipperer was also \"a portrait drypoint etcher of rank and depth\"<ref>''Bilder aus Heimat und Welt.'' In: Sonntagsbeitr\u00e4ge der Weser-Zeitung. Bremen. November 27, 1927.</ref> is shown by his portraits, which he executed as pencil drawings and etchings. During training in [[Kassel]] he had received an award for portrait drawing. \n\nIn the mid-twenties, Zipperer occasionally colored etchings by hand. As towards the end of the decade increasingly colored etchings were required, he had many of his motifs in color print.\n\nNumerous etchings were commissioned by cities, companies, art dealers or private individuals. A large part of the etchings was published by various publishers as art cards and sold through the art trade.\n\nZipperer worked for decades with the copper printing company Wilhelm Schneider in Berlin, where the [[Etching|copper plates]] were stored. A larger number of plates were lost during the Second World War and in the subsequent turmoil or got into unauthorized hands. This explains that pirate prints came into circulation as a result. \n\nWith his drypoint etchings Ernst Zipperer became known in Europe and America - less by exhibitions than by the very successful distribution of his pictures by some art publishers and numerous art shops in Germany and abroad.<ref group=\"A\">Copperplate printing company, art publishers and art dealers (selection):\n\nKupferdruckerei und Kunstverlag Wilhelm Schneider & Co, Berlin  /  Kunstverlag Balkheimer, Ulm (K\u00fcnstlerkarten)  /  Kunstverlag J.C.

Also some sketches in different techniques, which served for demonstration purposes in the classroom, are preserved from this time. \n\nErnst Zipperer\u2019s wife Elisabeth contributed considerably to his work since she kept him free from the burden of day-to-day activities. She handled business correspondence with the copperplate printers, art dealers and prospective buyers. Likewise, she helped to organize the countless visits of art lovers.\n\n=== Creative break (1941 \u2013 1949) ===\nDuring World War II and the immediately succeeding years, Ernst Zipperer\u2019s artistic activities almost came to a complete stop. The difficult conditions of everyday life at the castle left no scope for art.\n\n=== Late work (1950 \u2013 1972) ===\nAfter the turmoil of the war and the handover of Tannenburg to his son, Ernst Zipperer was able to devote himself entirely to his art. He left the era of drypoint behind him and entered a new intense phase of artistic creation. The late work of the artist is characterized by experimentation and new ideas. For Zipperer, the movement runs along the art-historical development of his time from realistic-naturalistic to [[Abstract art|abstract]]-reductionist representation. At the same time, the realistic and abstract modes of expression do not stand for a closed stage of artistic recognition. Rather, both exist side by side. Abstract depictions are again followed by a landscape or a bouquet of flowers.<ref name=\":1\" /> He is always looking for \"ground under his feet,\" as he called it.<ref name=\":2\">''Jedes Bild ist ein Wettlauf mit der Sonne''.

Schw\u00e4bisch Hall. April 22, 1972, p. 20.</ref> In many cases, these are already well-known motifs that recur again and again - often in a reduced form - trees in the landscape, a ravine and clouds above; especially the clouds occupied him throughout his life.<ref name=\":0\">''Der Maler auf der Tannenburg''. In: Haller Tagblatt. Schw\u00e4bisch Hall. No. 226, September 30, 1961.</ref> In addition, there are themes such as ''peace'' and ''quiet'', but also ''division'' and ''destruction'', which he translates abstractly.<ref name=\":2\" /> \u201eEverything you can think of, you can also draw\u201c, the artist described his own spectrum in later years. <ref>''Die Tannenburg \u2013 eine Trutzveste aus der Stauferzeit''.

He also transformed the music of [[Johann Sebastian Bach|Bach]], [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart|Mozart]] and [[Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky|Tchaikovsky]] into colors and forms.<gallery>\nFile:Ernst Zipperer-Ohne Titel.jpg|Before God, all men are equal, oil pastels, 1959\nFile:Ernst Zipperer-Der alte Mensch in der neuen Welt.jpg|The old man in the new world, oil pastels, 1967\nFile:Ernst Zipperer-Himmel und Erde.jpg|Heaven and earth, oil pastels, 1965\nFile:Ernst Zipperer-Entfaltung.jpg|Unfolding, oil pastels, 1965\nFile:Ernst Zipperer-Entwicklung.jpg|Development, pastel, 1967\nFile:Ernst Zipperer-Landschaft.jpg|Landscape, pastel, 1964\n</gallery>\n\n[[File:Ernst_Zipperer-Zwiegespraech.jpg|thumb|166x166px|Dialogue, Heliogravure, 1958]]\nErnst Zipperer found in [[pastel]] and [[Oil pastel|oil pastels]], but also in [[tempera]] and [[Oil painting|oil paint]] adequate materials to express his imagination and his mystical inwardness - sometimes cautious-mindful, then again powerful-dynamic.\n\nIn the gravure printing of the [[Photogravure|heliogravure]] Zipperer did in 1955 in cooperation with his Berlin printing on new ways on how he could spread some of his large-sized pastel paintings in large numbers. It is a fine-printing process that transfers the original to a copper plate in a complex photo-chemical process. The heliogravure makes a very differentiated reproduction of [[Halftone|halftones]] possible and thus creates a wealth of color power. The prints, also known as hand copper, met with great interest in the art trade and in the personal environment of the artist. They were affordable, allowing a wider audience access to this art.\n\nThere is not a single [[self-portrait]] by Ernst Zipperer. However, he draws a picture especially in his late works: In it he shows how he sees the visible and invisible world with his inner eye.\n\nIn addition to some extensive, there are many smaller [[Private collection|private collections]] with works by Ernst Zipperer. Individual works are held in German museums or municipal archives. Ernst Zipperer\u2019s artistic estate is managed by his daughter Vera Prior and grandson Lothar Zipperer.\n\n<br />\n== Exhibitions (selection) ==\nOktober 1927 in Offenburg, ''Die Kunstausstellung im B\u00fcrgersaal'', Offenburger Zeitung, October 15, 1927\n\n1927 in Braunschweig, ''Kunstgewerbemesse Elisabeth Osterloh''\n\nOktober 1929, ''Der Radierer Ernst Zipperer,'' Buchhandlung der Soldiner Zeitung, October 3, 1929\n\nApril 1931 in Ulm, ''Zipperer-Ausstellung im Kunsthaus G\u00f6bel,'' Ulmer Tagblatt, April 16, 1931\n\nSeptember 1931, Ausstellung von Zipperer-Radierungen in der Kunsthandlung Karl Balkheimer, Ulm\n\nOctober 1933 in Ellwangen, ''Zur Ausstellung von Radierungen Ernst Zipperers'', Ipf- und Jagstzeitung / Ellwanger Tagblatt, Oktober 28, 1933\n\nJuly 1963 in Ellwangen, ''Ausstellung im Bilderhaus Alois Raible'', Aalener Volkszeitung/Ipf- und Jagstzeitung, July 6, 1963\n\nApril 1972 in B\u00fchlertann, ''Ein Stiller im Lande'', Kreissparkasse B\u00fchlertann, Haller Tagblatt, April 22,1972\n\nFebrary 1978 in Ulm, ''Ulmer Motive \u2013 ins K\u00fcnstlerische \u00fcbersetzt'', Ausstellung im Kunsthaus Frey, Ulmer Zeitung, Febrary 11, 1978\n\nJune 2002 in B\u00fchlertann, Heimatverein B\u00fchlertann, Haller Tagblatt, June 28, 2002\n\nApril 2006 in Dresden, ''Villa Eschenbach zeigt allerlei Kunst um das Monet\u00e4re'', Leipziger Volkszeitung, April 24, 2006\n\nOctober 2010 in Nersingen-Oberfahlheim bei Ulm, ''Alte Ulmer Ansichten, Radierungen von Ernst Zipperer'', S\u00fcdwestpresse Ulm, October 15, 2010\n\nJunie 2013 in B\u00fchlertann, ''Ein\u00e4ugiger Blick auf die Heimat,'' Heimatverein B\u00fchlertann, Hohenloher Tagblatt, June 28, 2013\n\nJune 2016 in B\u00fchlertann, ''Zipperer-Werke im Rathaus'', Heimatverein B\u00fchlertann, Haller Tagblatt, June 23, 2016\n\nJuly 2018 in Schw\u00e4bisch Hall, ''Ernst Zipperer (1888 \u2013 1982) \u2013 Auf den Spuren seiner Kunst'', H\u00e4llisch-Fr\u00e4nkisches Museum Schw\u00e4bisch Hall, Haller Tagblatt, July 17, 2018\n\n== Bibliography ==\n\n=== Sources / Figures - chronological ===\n''Ernst Zipperer\u2019s personnel file''; Berlin-Friedenau Grammar School (01.10.1918 \u2013 31.03.1940).

The squadron was disestablished on 22 May 2012.\n\n=Squadron History=\n\n==1950s==\n\n===Roots===\n[[File:Consolidated PB4Y-2 Naval Aviation Museum.jpg|left|thumb|PB4Y-2 BuNo 66261 (marked as BuNo 66304) in the collection of the [[National Naval Aviation Museum]] at [[Naval Air Station Pensacola|NAS Pensacola]], [[Florida]].]]\nFleet Air Reconnaissance in the European Theater had been conducted since the start of the Cold War by detachments within patrol squadrons (VP) flying modified [[PB4Y-2 Privateer|PB4Y-2 Privateers]]<ref name=\"Donald\">Donald</ref> from [[Naval Air Station Port Lyautey|NAS Port Lyautey]] and conducting missions in the Baltic, Black, Mediterranean, and North Seas. These missions occasionally provoked reactions, sometimes hostile, from behind the Iron Curtain. On April 8, 1950, Soviet [[Lavochkin La-11]] fighters shot down a Lyautey-based PB4Y-2 Privateer (BUNO 59645) over the Baltic Sea, off the coast of Liep\u0101ja, Latvia with the loss of all ten aircrew<ref name=\"StaHypo1\">{{Cite web|title = History Of VQ-2.

As this unit demonstrated its value to the Navy, the Chief of Naval Operations (CNO) and the Bureau of Aeronautics (BuAer) came to realize that a dedicated aircraft was a necessity. \n\nBy 1952, the VP community had not had much success with the [[Martin P4M Mercator|P-4M-1 Mercator]]  that it had deployed to Morocco due to maintenance issues arising from its nineteen airframe total production run. The rest of the VP community found easier maintenance with the Lockheed P2V Neptunes deployed in theater because that airframe had been adopted as the VP standard asset. The maritime patrol commanders removed them from frontline service at Lyautey in favor of the Neptune.  Washington subsequently decided to reconfigure all but one P4M-1 as P4M-1Qs and permanently assign them to the Naval Communications Units established at NPU and its sister unit at Sangley Point, Philippines. Having lost an aircraft and lives to hostile Soviet action, the aircrew appreciated the added takeoff and combat speed of the two [[Allison J33-A-10A]] turbojet engines mounted in the aft of the [[Pratt & Whitney R-4360-20A Wasp Major]] radial's nacelles<ref name=\"East\">East, Don C.</ref>. \n\nIn 1953, with the conversion and deployment of the P4M-1Q, NPU needed  an administrative identity as part of the Naval Air Force Atlantic (AIRLANT) structure and Airborne Early Warning Squadron TWO (VW-2) at NAS Patuxent River became the command into which NPU was folded as VW-2 DET A. Since VW-2 Det A's mission began to diverge greatly from the parent unit's VW mission, the Navy decided to establish dedicated squadrons for the Fleet Air Reconnaissance mission. One was to be formed from VW-2 Det A and the other would be formed from its siter unit at Sangley, VW-1 Det A. By mid-1954, four P4M-1Qs and one [[Lockheed P-2 Neptune|Lockheed P2V-2 Neptune]] were at Lyautey. The P2V-2, stripped of ASW equipment, served as a trainer and logistics aircraft<ref name=\"StaHypo2\">{{Cite web|title = History Of VQ-2.

Regular deployment sites were [[Incirlik Air Base|Incirlik]], [[RAF Mildenhall|Mildehnall], [[Lucius D. Clay Kaserne|Wiesbaden]], [[Schleswig Air Base|Schleswig], and [[RAF Hal Far|Malta]]<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite web|title = Cold War Museum|url = http://www.coldwar.org/histories/HistoryofUSNavyFleetAirReconnaissancePartTwo.asp|website = www.coldwar.org|accessdate = 2015-11-08}}</ref>.\n\n===Establishment===\n\nVQ-2 was commissioned as [[Electronic countermeasure|Electronic Countermeasures]] Squadron TWO (ECMRON TWO) on September 1, 1955 to provide the United States with an improved defense posture. The squadron took over VW-2 DET A's spcaes and hangar at NAS Port Lyautey.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|title = VQ-2 Fleet Air  Reconnaissance Squadron TWO|url = http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/agency/navy/vq-2.htm|website = www.globalsecurity.org|accessdate = 2015-11-06}}</ref> Through the 1950s, VQ-2 would continue to fly missions throughout the European Theater operating from Cyprus, Germany, Libya, Turkey, and the United Kingdom. At commissioning, Commander Morris L. Kalin led a total complement of 24 officers and 78 enlisted men<ref name=\"East\" />.\n\n[[File:Martin P4M Mercator VQ-2 06.09.56.jpg|thumb|left|P4M-1Q Mercator of VQ-2 electronics reconnaissance squadron in September 1956 - note extra radar 'bulges' on this variant.]]\n[[File:P2V-5 NAS Jacksonville 1952.jpg|thumb|left|P2V-5 with nose turret in 1952. The Lyautey P2V-5Fs had additional turbojets mounted on nacelles where the rockets are in this photo.]]\nThe squadron continued using the six P4M-1Qs as mission aircraft. In addition, they obtained three Lockheed P2V-5Fs. The P2V-5Fs were reconfigured onsite from the standard maritime reconnaissance to similar electronic suites as the P-4Ms. Of note, the P2v-5Fs had the same dash speed capability as the P4Ms from two [[Westinghouse J34]]-WE-34 turbojets mounted on their own nacelles outboard the [[Wright R-3350 Duplex-Cyclone|Wright R-3350-32W Cyclone Turbo-compound]] radials. The squadron used the P2V-3 for pilot training and logistics, since it was not configured for electronic reconnaissance (this became a standard squadron practice when possible; using a \"bare bones airframe of one of its models for training and logistics)<ref name=\"East\" />. The four Neptunes would serve alongside the Mercators until 1960.\n\nIn September 1956, a new and faster [[Carrier-based aircraft|carrier-capable]] [[Douglas A-3 Skywarrior|A3D-1Q Skywarrior]] was delivered to the squadron. The A3D-1Q, nicknamed \"The Whale\" was a reconfigured A3D-1 with the bombay closed and an electronic reconnaissance suite installed similar to those of the P4M-1Q and P2V-5F<ref name=\"Francillon\">Francillon</ref><ref name=\"Heinemann\">Heinemann</ref><ref name=\"Gunston\">Gunston</ref>. The Whale was a carrier-capable high-wing, twin-jet aircraft with a crew of four<ref name= \"Winchester\">Winchester 2006, p. 75.</ref>. The A-3 was also one of the fastest non-afterburner aircraft in the US Armed Forces with a service ceiling significantly higher than the Mercators and Neptunes which gave the aircraft a greater area of coverage<ref name=\"East\"/>. The squadron also received an A3D-1 which it use like the P2V-3<ref name=\"East\" />. Although the pilots and navigators came to the command after carrier-qualifying, the squadron operated the A-3 from land bases until the next decade unlike her sister squadron VQ-1<ref name=\"Hypo2\" /><ref name=\"East\" />. With the high tempo of operations and depot-level maintenance for the three models back in the continental United States (CONUS), it is unsurprising that on 1 June 1957, the command had three P4M-1Q,, two A3D-1Q, two P2V-5F, one A3D-1, and one P2V-3 reported in its table of organization (TOE)<ref name=\"East\" />.\n\nThe [[1958 Lebanon crisis|Lebanon Crisis in 1958]] on 15 July 1958, saw a p4M-1Q and aircrew shift south from Incirlik to fly out of Beirut while the US Marines and US Army were deployed there at the behest of [[Camille Chamoun]], the President. VQ-2 operated out of [[Beirut Airport]] through the remainder of the summer and into the fall, departing with the withdrawal of US forces after stabilization in October 1958.\n\n===Homeport Change===\n\nAs a result of the Pact of Madrid, signed on 23 September 1953 by [[Francoist Spain|Spain]] and the [[United States]], the US pledged  to furnish [[foreign aid|economic]] and [[military aid]] to Spain. The United States, in turn, was to be permitted to construct and to utilize air and naval bases on Spanish territory ([[Naval Station Rota]], [[Mor\u00f3n Air Base]], [[Torrej\u00f3n Air Base]], and [[Zaragoza Air Base]]). By 1959, the base at Rota and its airfield had been completed to satisfy the US Navy's aviation needs. Due to its newer facilities, the Navy decided to move VQ-2 to Rota.\n\nThe relocation of the squadron to Rota began in late 1958 into the first days of 1959. The shift of the squadron CO, XO, and department heads (DHs) was completed by 14 January 1959, but it would take another year to transfer all command assets to Rota<ref name=\"East\" />. All assets at Lyautey had to be surveyed, packed up, and moved. \n\nDuring this evolution, five seven-seat A3D-2Q aircraft arrived to replace the four-seat A3D-1Qs. These new aircraft had the bulkhead between the  cockpit and the bomb bay removed, the bomb bay sealed, and three more seats and equipment added in the former bay.<ref name=\":0\" /><ref name=\"East\" />. This unarmed version (the tail gun had been removed<ref name=\"Francillon\" />) brought an increase in capability to the community.\n\n===Aircraft/Aircrew Losses and Mishaps===\n\nOver the course of the decade, VQ-2 suffered the eleven aircrew fatalities and three aircraft in three mishaps:\n# On 6 January 1958, at the end of a ferry flight from Port Lyautey, via Lajes, Azores and Bermuda to [[NAS Norfolk]], Virginia, P4M-1Q (BUNO 124373)<ref name='VPNavy'>{{Cite web|title = VQ-2 Mishaps|url =https://www.vpnavy.com/vq2_mishap.html|website = www.vpnavy.com|accessdate = 2020-03-08}}</ref> lost an engine on approach. The aircraft crashed at at 22 St. and E. Ocean Ave., Norfolk, killing four crew and injuring three civilians.<ref name=\"Anderson\">\"Four Missing In Air Crash\", ''The Anderson Independent'', 7 January 1958</ref> Two aircrew were injured and one was uninjured.\n# On 16 October 1958, returning to Incirlik, A3D-1Q (BUNO 130356)<ref name=\"A3BUNO\">{{Cite web|title = All A-3 Skywarriors Produced by Douglas|url =https://www.a3skywarrior.com/ready-room/a-3-dispositions/a-3-production.html|website = www.a3skywarrior.com|accessdate = 2020-03-08}}</ref> crashed near the airfield. All four aircrew aboard were killed.\n\n==1960s==\n\n===Change===\nWhile keeping the alphanumeric designation VQ-2, EMCRON TWO was renamed Fleet Air Reconnaissance Squadron TWO (FAIRECONRON TWO) on January 1, 1960. Its sister squadron, [[VQ-1]] was similarly renamed. On 14 January 1960, with all equipment and personnel out of Lyautey, VQ-2 officially transferred to Naval Station. \n\nThe Navy had recognized that the maintenance costs of the aging, worn P4M-1Q and P2V-5F airframes were increasingly more expensive to maintain, and these planes needed replacement. Washington opted for a larger, more capable aircraft, the [[EC-121 Warning Star|Lockheed WV-2Q Warning Star]]. The \"Willie Victors,\" unarmed like the A3D-2Qs<ref name=\":0\" />, could carry a crew of twenty-six. On 26 February 1960, the first two WV-2Q arrived. By the end of the first quarter in 1960, 31 March, VQ-2'aircraft inventory were five A3D-2Q, three P2V-5F, two P4M-1Q, and two WV-2Q. The P2V-5F and P4M-1Q aircraft were soon to be phased out as all hands quickly adapted to the A3D-2Q and WV-2Q airframes. Meanwhile, the\u00b7squadron continued its business of airborne electronic reconnaissance. By the summer of 1960, the Mercators and Neptunes were gone.\n\nOn 18 September 1962, the Department of Defense (DoD) initiated its Tri-Service Aircraft Designation System which replaced the 1922 USN Aircraft Designation System. The new unified system for designating all US military aircraft was a ''Type/Model/Series'' (T/M/S).<ref name=\"TMS\">{{cite web|url=http://www.designation-systems.info/usmilav/aircraft.html|title=Current Designations of U.S. Military Aircraft|website = www.designation-systems.info|accessdate = 2020-03-08}}</ref>. With this change, the A3D-2Q became the EA-3B and the WV-2Q became the EC-121M<ref name=\":0\" />.\n\n[[File:Lockheed EC-121M VQ-2.jpg|left|thumb|A U.S. Navy Lockheed EC-121M Warning Star of VQ-2.]]\n\n===In Theater Operations===\n\nIn response to the [[Berlin Crisis of 1961]], VQ-2 flew missions in West Germany along the border with Czechoslovakia and East Germany as well as their routine missions into the Baltic. By now these were being carried out primarily by the WV-2Qs with A3D-2Qs filling in as needed<ref name=\":0\" />. Tensions continued to increase as the Kennedy administration and its NATO allies responded to Soviet moves in Europe.\n\nFollowing the Cuban Missile Crisis was [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 186|Cyprus Crisis in 1964]] saw an increase in international tensions in the Eastern Mediterranean. This led to an increase in EC-121M and EA-3B presence in the Levant<ref name=\"East\"/>. Afterwards, a series of eastern Mediterranean crises provided ample opportunities for VQ-2 to perform timely reconnaissance<ref name=\"StaHypo\" />. A major factor in the more direct tactical reconnaissance shipboard role was the rapidly growing and modernizing Soviet Navy that established a continuous presence in the Mediterranean, concurrent with the Cyprus Crisis. In response to these crises, VQ-2 started operating EA-3B detachments aboard a Mediterranean-based carriers like her sister squadron, VQ-1 did in the Pacific. In January of 1965, the first planes went aboard the [[USS Saratoga (CV-60)|USS Saratoga (CVA-60)]]. Detachments aboardupport to the Mediterranean deployed carriers.\n\nWhile operating in Vietnam and the Philippines, the political tensions in the Middle East and North Africa were building. In June of 1967, armed conflict erupted into the [[Six-Day War]] where Israel defeated its enemies. The loss of the [[USS Liberty]] during the war at the hands of the IDF reaffirmed the relative safety of using aircraft for fleet reconnaissance<ref name=\"East\" />. This incident kept the high tempo of operations in the Eastern Mediterranean despite a cessation of strife in Cyprus. The coup in Libya in 1969 combined with the ever increasing presence of the Soviet Navy to counter the presence of the NATO navies in the Mediterranean kept the command operating at a high tempo.\n\nAs the decade came to a close, VQ-2 found itself operating all over Europe from various NATO bases, from US Sixth Fleet carriers, as well as in Southeast Asia.\n\n===Cuban Missile Crisis===\n\nIn October 1962 the [[Cuban Missile Crisis]] developed. Since the Navy had no comparable reconnaissance assets available in CONUS<ref name=\"StaHypo\" />, VQ-2 deployed a number of EA-3B and an EC-121M aircraft to [[NAS Key West]] to provide those services around Cuba. After this major superpower crisis was defused, the assets returned to Spain. The squadron's rapidity and flexibility demonstrated in Florida<ref name=\"VQH\" /> kept it very busy when it returned to Europe where it resumed missions in the Mediterranean, Baltic, and central Europe. \n===Vietnam===\n\nDuring the Vietnam War, the squadron deployed detachments to augment  VQ-1's support of US Navy operations in and around Vietnam under CINCPACFLT operational control. In late summer 1965, VQ-2 established DET ALFA at [[NAS Cubi Point]], Philippines. Sorties were routinely flown by EA-3Bs and EC-121Ms into the theater to support US Navy combat operations in Vietnam. After it sister squadron, [[VQ-1]], established its DET BRAVO flying from [[Da Nang]] Air Base in South Vietnam in 1966, VQ-2 EA-3Bs joined them operating almost exclusively from there as VQ-2 DET BRAVO<ref name=\"East\" />. From both locations, VQ-2 aircraft provided continuous electronic reconnaissance capability over the area, including the [[Ho Chi Minh Trail]] and [[Gulf of Tonkin]]<ref name=\"East\" />. As combat operations from CTF 77 on [[Yankee Station]] into North Vietnamese airspace increased, VQ-2 joined VQ-1 in deploying EA-3Bs to the attack carriers in theater. VQ-2 ceased operations from Da Nang in 1969, but continued to deploy to the aircraft carriers and Cubi Point.\n\n===Aircraft/Aircrew Losses and Mishaps===\n\nOver the course of the decade, VQ-2 suffered the fifty-two aircrew fatalities and five aircraft in seven mishaps.\n# Two days after the official move, on 16 January 1960, P4M-1Q (BUNO 124365) crashed into a mountainside at 9,000 feet om approach to crashed on approach to [[Incirlik Air Base|Incirlik AFB]].

DET BRAVO shipped the airframe to CONUS for repairs via sealift. In rough weather in Tokyo Bay on 14 December 1968, the plane broke loose from its tie downs and was lost overboard.\n\n==1970s==\n\n===Continued Change===\n[[File:EP-3E Orion of VQ-2 parked c1971.jpg|thumb|EP-3E Aries of VQ-2 parked in 1971]]\nIn the second decade of the squadron's forward basing in Spain, the American presence in Rota saw the relocation of the destroyer squadron that had been based in Athens arrive just as the submarine squadron returned to CONUS. <ref name=\"East\"/> The greater availability of assignments at the Aviation Intermediate Maintenance Depot (AIMD) across the hangar fro the squadron saw an increase in \"homesteading\" (remaining at one location as long as one's career would allow) by enlisted personnel as the rate of intermarriage with Spanish host nationals increased.\n\nThe EC-121Ms' career in the command had been a second lease on life since the airframes when acquired by VQ-2On 31 July 1971 were over ten years old<ref name=\":2\" /><ref name=\"VQH\" />. These twenty-year plus planes were failing to meet the reconnaissance demands placed upon the squadron. On 31 July 1971, the squadron received its first delivery of the [[Lockheed EP-3|EP-3E Aries]] aircraft.<ref name=\":0\" /> These EP-3s were converted from [[Lockheed P-3 Orion|P-3A and P-3B]] airframes. This relatively newer airframe gave the squadron a more reliable platform due to its commonality with the VP P-3s, the availability of parts, and the lower flight hours on the aircraft. It would take five years until the final EP-3E arrived in Rota. By the end of 1974, enough Aries were in Rota to let VQ-2 to stop operating its EC-121Ms. \n\nIn May of 1972, VQ-2 also received a TA-3B and a UP-3A to use for crew training and logistics. These aircraft flew regularly from Rota on local flights as well as airlifts and parts runs to various detachments ashore and afloat. Of note, after 1974, the detachment at Incirlik, relocated to [[Hellenikon Air Base|Athens]]. Due to Greece's popularity with British vacationers, the squadron saw an increase in intermarriage between its sailors and British nationals as well as with host nation citizens.\n\n===Continued Crisis===\n\nIn this decade, the Cold War continued with a lessening of tensions with the Soviet Union due to the Nixon administration's police of the [[D\u00e9tente|d\u00e9tente]]. While this reduced the frequency of operations in the North Atlantic, Baltic, and Germany, the decade was frequently marked by international crises in the Mediterranean. Notable among these were the fallout from [[1969 Libyan coup d'\u00e9tat| the 1969 coup in Libya]], the [[Black September|1970 Jordan Crisis]], the [[Yom Kippur War|1973 Yom Kippur War]], the [[1974 Cypriot coup d'\u00e9tat|1974 crisis in Cyprus]], and the [[Lebanese Civil War|multiple flareups]] in Lebanon. The US Sixth Fleet and its NATO allies maintained a presence offshore in response to all these crises. \n\nDespite d\u00e9tente, the Soviet Union was conducting a program of providing significant amounts of military hardware to its client states of Libya, Syria, and Egypt. At the same time, the Soviet Navy continued increasing its presence in the Mediterranean. While Egypt left the Soviet fold after the Yom Kippur War, the buildups on the levane and North Africa made the Central and Eastern Mediterranean hot spots for VQ-2's monitoring of Soviet naval units as well as activities ashore. As a result high tempo operations lasted through the decade despite the overall drawdown of the US military after Vietnam.\n\nIn 1979, the [[Iranian Revolution]] saw an increased US presence in the Persian Gulf and Indian Ocean. In response, the Navy maintained at least one carrier battle group in the vicinity of the Gulf. VQ-2 shared the manning of carrier and Diego Garcia detachments.<ref name=\":2\" /><ref name=\"East\" /> This manning would continue until the third phase of the [[Lebanese Civil War]] in 1982.\n\n===Aircraft/Aircrew Losses and Mishaps===\n\nAlthough the decade was less lethal than its predecessor, VQ-2 suffered the twelve aircrew fatalities and lost three aircraft in mishaps.\n# On 26 February 1970, EA-3B (BUNO 144851)<ref name=\"A3BUNO\" /> was lost while operating from the [[USS Franklin D. Roosevelt (CV-42)|USS ''Franklin D. Roosevelt'']] in the Mediterranean. The [[Aircraft catapult|catapult]] system malfunctioned in mid-stroke, also known as a 'cold cat,\" resulting in the Whale \u201cdribbling\u201d off the bow and being run over by the carrier<ref name=\"East\" />. Four of the crew members died in the accident<ref name=\":2\"/> \n# On 8 March 1974, EA-3B (BUNO 142257)<ref name=\"A3BUNO\" /> was lost while operating from the [[USS America (CV-66)|USS ''America '']]  in the Mediterranean. A cable parted in the [[Arresting gear]] when the tailhook caught the wire. The pilot who had begun retarding the throttles to idle as per standard procedure, slammed them forward managing to regain enough airspeed to get the plane off the angle and ditch it in the water off to the port side. This allowed the plane to avoid being run over by the ship. The America's plane guard helicopter recovered all the aircrew. The airframe continued to float forcing the ship to have one of its A-7A' strafe it to sink it as it was deemed a hazard to navigation<ref name=\"A3H\" /> \n# On 9 July 1974, the squadron suffered another A-3 loss when its VIP transport-configured A-3, a TA-3B (BUNO 144863)<ref name=\"A3BUNO\" /> crashed at [[Naples International Airport|Capodichino]] in Naples, Italy on approach. All eight aircrew perished in the crash.\n\nThroughout the remainder of the 1970s, the command suffered no aircraft losses.\n\n==1980s==\n[[File:EA-3B VQ-2 after landing on USS Saratoga (CV-60) c1986.jpg|left|thumb|EA-3B VQ-2 after landing on [[USS Saratoga (CV-60)|USS]] Saratoga inn 1986.]]\n===Constant Change===\nAs VQ-2 entered the mid-1980s, the frenzied pace of operations including [[Operation Mole Cricket 19]](Arab-Israel [[Beqaa Valley|Beqaa]] War), and continuing with 1982 - 1983 [[Multinational Force in Lebanon|Beirut Crisis]] with the [[1983 Beirut barracks bombing|U.S. Marine barracks bombing]], and the [[United States Sixth Fleet|Sixth Fleet]] December [[Multinational Force in Lebanon|1983 air strike into Lebanon]], allowed little leisure time for the squadron.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\nVQ-2 was awarded the [[Navy Expeditionary Medal]] for participation in the Beirut evacuation and operations in the vicinity of [[Libya]] during [[1986 United States bombing of Libya|Operation El Dorado Canyon]], 12\u201317 April 1986.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nOn 25 January 1987, an EA-3B crashed on the USS Nimitz killing all seven crew members.\n\n==1990s==\nIn the summer of 1990, the squadron provided electronic reconnaissance during the evacuation of 2000 non-combatant personnel from war-stricken [[Liberia]] in [[operation Sharp Edge]].<ref name=\":0\" />\n[[File:Lockheed EP-3E Orion (ARIES), USA - Navy AN2094464.jpg|thumb|EP-3E of VQ-2 based at Rota, Spain, seen arriving for [[Royal International Air Tattoo|RIAT]] '92.]]\nFrom August 1990 to April 1991, VQ-2 provided combat reconnaissance during operations [[Gulf War|Desert Shield/Desert Storm]], Proven Force, and [[Operation Provide Comfort|Provide Comfort]].<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nOn 29 June 1991, the first EP-3E Aries II aircraft arrived in Rota and on 20 September 1991, the squadron retired the EA-3B Skywarrior the same year.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nStarting in July 1992, VQ-2 flew support missions with Operations [[Operation Deny Flight|Deny Flight]], Provide Promise, Sharp Guard, Joint Endeavor, Decisive Endeavor, and Deliberate Guard providing combat reconnaissance and intelligence to [[NATO]] and [[United Nations]] forces in the Former [[Yugoslavia]].<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nAs of 1997, VQ-2 operated four EP-3E Aries II aircraft and two [[Lockheed P-3 Orion|P-3C Orion]] aircraft from its home-base at Rota and two-plane detachment at [[Souda Bay|Naval Support Activity Souda Bay, Crete]].<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nIn March 1997, VQ-2 provided electronic reconnaissance during the evacuation of non-combatant personnel from [[Albania]] following unrest from a failed [[Pyramid scheme|pyramid savings scheme]] during [[Operation Silver Wake]].<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n==2000s==\nVQ-2 relocated from NS Rota, Spain, to NAS Whidbey Island, effective 1 September 2005.

On April 8, 1950, Soviet [[Lavochkin La-11]] fighters shot down a Lyautey-based PB4Y-2 Privateer (BUNO 59645) over the Baltic Sea, off the coast of Liep\u0101ja, Latvia with the loss of all ten aircrew<ref name=\"StaHypo1\">{{Cite web|title = History Of VQ-2.

As this unit demonstrated its value to the Navy, the Chief of Naval Operations (CNO) and the Bureau of Aeronautics (BuAer) came to realize that a dedicated aircraft was a necessity. \n\nBy 1952, the VP community had not had much success with the [[Martin P4M Mercator|P-4M-1 Mercator]]  that it had deployed to Morocco due to maintenance issues arising from its nineteen airframe total production run. The rest of the VP community found easier maintenance with the Lockheed P2V Neptunes deployed in theater because that airframe had been adopted as the VP standard asset. The maritime patrol commanders removed them from frontline service at Lyautey in favor of the Neptune.  Washington subsequently decided to reconfigure all but one P4M-1 as P4M-1Qs and permanently assign them to the Naval Communications Units established at NPU and its sister unit at Sangley Point, Philippines. Having lost an aircraft and lives to hostile Soviet action, the aircrew appreciated the added takeoff and combat speed of the two [[Allison J33-A-10A]] turbojet engines mounted in the aft of the [[Pratt & Whitney R-4360-20A Wasp Major]] radial's nacelles<ref name=\"East\">East, Don C.</ref>. \n\nIn 1953, with the conversion and deployment of the P4M-1Q, NPU needed  an administrative identity as part of the Naval Air Force Atlantic (AIRLANT) structure and Airborne Early Warning Squadron TWO (VW-2) at NAS Patuxent River became the command into which NPU was folded as VW-2 DET A. Since VW-2 Det A's mission began to diverge greatly from the parent unit's VW mission, the Navy decided to establish dedicated squadrons for the Fleet Air Reconnaissance mission. One was to be formed from VW-2 Det A and the other would be formed from its siter unit at Sangley, VW-1 Det A. By mid-1954, four P4M-1Qs and one [[Lockheed P-2 Neptune|Lockheed P2V-2 Neptune]] were at Lyautey. The P2V-2, stripped of ASW equipment, served as a trainer and logistics aircraft<ref name=\"StaHypo2\">{{Cite web|title = History Of VQ-2.

The Lyautey P2V-5Fs had additional turbojets mounted on nacelles where the rockets are in this photo.]]\nThe squadron continued using the six P4M-1Qs as mission aircraft. In addition, they obtained three Lockheed P2V-5Fs. The P2V-5Fs were reconfigured onsite from the standard maritime reconnaissance to similar electronic suites as the P-4Ms. Of note, the P2v-5Fs had the same dash speed capability as the P4Ms from two [[Westinghouse J34]]-WE-34 turbojets mounted on their own nacelles outboard the [[Wright R-3350 Duplex-Cyclone|Wright R-3350-32W Cyclone Turbo-compound]] radials. The squadron used the P2V-3 for pilot training and logistics, since it was not configured for electronic reconnaissance (this became a standard squadron practice when possible; using a \"bare bones airframe of one of its models for training and logistics)<ref name=\"East\" />. The four Neptunes would serve alongside the Mercators until 1960.\n\nIn September 1956, a new and faster [[Carrier-based aircraft|carrier-capable]] [[Douglas A-3 Skywarrior|A3D-1Q Skywarrior]] was delivered to the squadron. The A3D-1Q, nicknamed \"The Whale\" was a reconfigured A3D-1 with the bombay closed and an electronic reconnaissance suite installed similar to those of the P4M-1Q and P2V-5F<ref name=\"Francillon\">Francillon</ref><ref name=\"Heinemann\">Heinemann</ref><ref name=\"Gunston\">Gunston</ref>. The Whale was a carrier-capable high-wing, twin-jet aircraft with a crew of four<ref name= \"Winchester\">Winchester 2006, p. 75.</ref>. The A-3 was also one of the fastest non-afterburner aircraft in the US Armed Forces with a service ceiling significantly higher than the Mercators and Neptunes which gave the aircraft a greater area of coverage<ref name=\"East\"/>. The squadron also received an A3D-1 which it use like the P2V-3<ref name=\"East\" />. Although the pilots and navigators came to the command after carrier-qualifying, the squadron operated the A-3 from land bases until the next decade unlike her sister squadron VQ-1<ref name=\"Hypo2\" /><ref name=\"East\" />. With the high tempo of operations and depot-level maintenance for the three models back in the continental United States (CONUS), it is unsurprising that on 1 June 1957, the command had three P4M-1Q,, two A3D-1Q, two P2V-5F, one A3D-1, and one P2V-3 reported in its table of organization (TOE)<ref name=\"East\" />.\n\nThe [[1958 Lebanon crisis|Lebanon Crisis in 1958]] on 15 July 1958, saw a p4M-1Q and aircrew shift south from Incirlik to fly out of Beirut while the US Marines and US Army were deployed there at the behest of [[Camille Chamoun]], the President. VQ-2 operated out of [[Beirut Airport]] through the remainder of the summer and into the fall, departing with the withdrawal of US forces after stabilization in October 1958.\n\n===Homeport Change===\n\nAs a result of the Pact of Madrid, signed on 23 September 1953 by [[Francoist Spain|Spain]] and the [[United States]], the US pledged  to furnish [[foreign aid|economic]] and [[military aid]] to Spain. The United States, in turn, was to be permitted to construct and to utilize air and naval bases on Spanish territory ([[Naval Station Rota]], [[Mor\u00f3n Air Base]], [[Torrej\u00f3n Air Base]], and [[Zaragoza Air Base]]). By 1959, the base at Rota and its airfield had been completed to satisfy the US Navy's aviation needs. Due to its newer facilities, the Navy decided to move VQ-2 to Rota.\n\nThe relocation of the squadron to Rota began in late 1958 into the first days of 1959. The shift of the squadron CO, XO, and department heads (DHs) was completed by 14 January 1959, but it would take another year to transfer all command assets to Rota<ref name=\"East\" />. All assets at Lyautey had to be surveyed, packed up, and moved. \n\nDuring this evolution, five seven-seat A3D-2Q aircraft arrived to replace the four-seat A3D-1Qs. These new aircraft had the bulkhead between the  cockpit and the bomb bay removed, the bomb bay sealed, and three more seats and equipment added in the former bay.<ref name=\":0\" /><ref name=\"East\" />. This unarmed version (the tail gun had been removed<ref name=\"Francillon\" />) brought an increase in capability to the community.\n\n===Aircraft/Aircrew Losses and Mishaps===\n\nOver the course of the decade, VQ-2 suffered the eleven aircrew fatalities and three aircraft in three mishaps:\n# On 6 January 1958, at the end of a ferry flight from Port Lyautey, via Lajes, Azores and Bermuda to [[NAS Norfolk]], Virginia, P4M-1Q (BUNO 124373)<ref name='VPNavy'>{{Cite web|title = VQ-2 Mishaps|url =https://www.vpnavy.com/vq2_mishap.html|website = www.vpnavy.com|accessdate = 2020-03-08}}</ref> lost an engine on approach.

All four aircrew aboard were killed.\n\n==1960s==\n\n===Change===\nWhile keeping the alphanumeric designation VQ-2, EMCRON TWO was renamed Fleet Air Reconnaissance Squadron TWO (FAIRECONRON TWO) on January 1, 1960. Its sister squadron, [[VQ-1]] was similarly renamed. On 14 January 1960, with all equipment and personnel out of Lyautey, VQ-2 officially transferred to Naval Station. \n\nThe Navy had recognized that the maintenance costs of the aging, worn P4M-1Q and P2V-5F airframes were increasingly more expensive to maintain, and these planes needed replacement. Washington opted for a larger, more capable aircraft, the [[EC-121 Warning Star|Lockheed WV-2Q Warning Star]]. The \"Willie Victors,\" unarmed like the A3D-2Qs<ref name=\":0\" />, could carry a crew of twenty-six. On 26 February 1960, the first two WV-2Q arrived. By the end of the first quarter in 1960, 31 March, VQ-2'aircraft inventory were five A3D-2Q, three P2V-5F, two P4M-1Q, and two WV-2Q. The P2V-5F and P4M-1Q aircraft were soon to be phased out as all hands quickly adapted to the A3D-2Q and WV-2Q airframes. Meanwhile, the\u00b7squadron continued its business of airborne electronic reconnaissance. By the summer of 1960, the Mercators and Neptunes were gone.\n\nOn 18 September 1962, the Department of Defense (DoD) initiated its Tri-Service Aircraft Designation System which replaced the 1922 USN Aircraft Designation System. The new unified system for designating all US military aircraft was a ''Type/Model/Series'' (T/M/S).<ref name=\"TMS\">{{cite web|url=http://www.designation-systems.info/usmilav/aircraft.html|title=Current Designations of U.S. Military Aircraft|website = www.designation-systems.info|accessdate = 2020-03-08}}</ref>. With this change, the A3D-2Q became the EA-3B and the WV-2Q became the EC-121M<ref name=\":0\" />.\n\n[[File:Lockheed EC-121M VQ-2.jpg|left|thumb|A U.S. Navy Lockheed EC-121M Warning Star of VQ-2.]]\n\n===In Theater Operations===\n\nIn response to the [[Berlin Crisis of 1961]], VQ-2 flew missions in West Germany along the border with Czechoslovakia and East Germany as well as their routine missions into the Baltic. By now these were being carried out primarily by the WV-2Qs with A3D-2Qs filling in as needed<ref name=\":0\" />. Tensions continued to increase as the Kennedy administration and its NATO allies responded to Soviet moves in Europe.\n\nFollowing the Cuban Missile Crisis was [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 186|Cyprus Crisis in 1964]] saw an increase in international tensions in the Eastern Mediterranean. This led to an increase in EC-121M and EA-3B presence in the Levant<ref name=\"East\"/>. Afterwards, a series of eastern Mediterranean crises provided ample opportunities for VQ-2 to perform timely reconnaissance<ref name=\"StaHypo\" />. A major factor in the more direct tactical reconnaissance shipboard role was the rapidly growing and modernizing Soviet Navy that established a continuous presence in the Mediterranean, concurrent with the Cyprus Crisis. In response to these crises, VQ-2 started operating EA-3B detachments aboard a Mediterranean-based carriers like her sister squadron, VQ-1 did in the Pacific. In January of 1965, the first planes went aboard the [[USS Saratoga (CV-60)|USS Saratoga (CVA-60)]]. Detachments aboardupport to the Mediterranean deployed carriers.\n\nWhile operating in Vietnam and the Philippines, the political tensions in the Middle East and North Africa were building. In June of 1967, armed conflict erupted into the [[Six-Day War]] where Israel defeated its enemies. The loss of the [[USS Liberty]] during the war at the hands of the IDF reaffirmed the relative safety of using aircraft for fleet reconnaissance<ref name=\"East\" />. This incident kept the high tempo of operations in the Eastern Mediterranean despite a cessation of strife in Cyprus. The coup in Libya in 1969 combined with the ever increasing presence of the Soviet Navy to counter the presence of the NATO navies in the Mediterranean kept the command operating at a high tempo.\n\nAs the decade came to a close, VQ-2 found itself operating all over Europe from various NATO bases, from US Sixth Fleet carriers, as well as in Southeast Asia.\n\n===Cuban Missile Crisis===\n\nIn October 1962 the [[Cuban Missile Crisis]] developed. Since the Navy had no comparable reconnaissance assets available in CONUS<ref name=\"StaHypo\" />, VQ-2 deployed a number of EA-3B and an EC-121M aircraft to [[NAS Key West]] to provide those services around Cuba. After this major superpower crisis was defused, the assets returned to Spain. The squadron's rapidity and flexibility demonstrated in Florida<ref name=\"VQH\" /> kept it very busy when it returned to Europe where it resumed missions in the Mediterranean, Baltic, and central Europe. \n===Vietnam===\n\nDuring the Vietnam War, the squadron deployed detachments to augment  VQ-1's support of US Navy operations in and around Vietnam under CINCPACFLT operational control. In late summer 1965, VQ-2 established DET ALFA at [[NAS Cubi Point]], Philippines. Sorties were routinely flown by EA-3Bs and EC-121Ms into the theater to support US Navy combat operations in Vietnam. After it sister squadron, [[VQ-1]], established its DET BRAVO flying from [[Da Nang]] Air Base in South Vietnam in 1966, VQ-2 EA-3Bs joined them operating almost exclusively from there as VQ-2 DET BRAVO<ref name=\"East\" />. From both locations, VQ-2 aircraft provided continuous electronic reconnaissance capability over the area, including the [[Ho Chi Minh Trail]] and [[Gulf of Tonkin]]<ref name=\"East\" />. As combat operations from CTF 77 on [[Yankee Station]] into North Vietnamese airspace increased, VQ-2 joined VQ-1 in deploying EA-3Bs to the attack carriers in theater. VQ-2 ceased operations from Da Nang in 1969, but continued to deploy to the aircraft carriers and Cubi Point.\n\n===Aircraft/Aircrew Losses and Mishaps===\n\nOver the course of the decade, VQ-2 suffered the fifty-two aircrew fatalities and five aircraft in seven mishaps.\n# Two days after the official move, on 16 January 1960, P4M-1Q (BUNO 124365) crashed into a mountainside at 9,000 feet om approach to crashed on approach to [[Incirlik Air Base|Incirlik AFB]]. The crew had been flying in to relieve the detachment that had been operating there<ref name=\":0\" />. All sixteen aircrew were killed.\n# On 22 May, 1962, a WV-2Q (BUNO 131390)<ref name=\"DeanBoys\">{{Cite web|title = Crash of a Lockheed WV-2Q Super Constellation in Markt Schwaben: 26 Killed|url =https://www.baaa-acro.com/crash/crash-lockheed-wv-2q-super-constellation-markt-schwaben-26-killed|website = www.baaa-acro.com|accessdate = 2020-03-08}}</ref> staged at [[Lucius D.

The aircraft iced up, the engines flamed out, and it stalled into a spin. The pilot ordered the crew to bail out. The four aircrew in the aft compartment bailed. Just as the crew chief was getting ready to go, the pilot got a restart and recovered out of the spin. The aircraft with the pilot, navigator and crew chief made it back to DET ALFA. The other four perished with only one body recovered and the personal effects of the other three.<ref name=\"A3BUNO\" /><ref name=\"StaHypo\" />\n# On 3 November 1966, an EA-3B (BUNO 146458)<ref name=\"A3BUNO\" /> struck the water aft of the ship inbound to a night recovery on the [[USS Independence (CV-62)|USS Independence (CVA-62)]] in the central Mediterranean off [[Sicily]].

With the plane seeming to enter a stall, the pilot signalled for a crew bail out. The four aircrew in the aft compartment bailed but at 1200 feet altitude. Again, just as the crew chief was getting ready to go, the slat suddenly operated allowing a recovery at Ramstein. Although bailing out at a low altitude, the four back end crew survived.<ref name=\"A3BUNO\" /><ref name=\"StaHypo\" />\n# On 4 June 1968, an EA-3B (BUNO 142670)<ref name=\"A3BUNO\" />, flown by the new (by barely beyond a month)squadron CO, CDR T.E.

DET BRAVO shipped the airframe to CONUS for repairs via sealift. In rough weather in Tokyo Bay on 14 December 1968, the plane broke loose from its tie downs and was lost overboard.\n\n==1970s==\n\n===Continued Change===\n[[File:EP-3E Orion of VQ-2 parked c1971.jpg|thumb|EP-3E Aries of VQ-2 parked in 1971]]\nIn the second decade of the squadron's forward basing in Spain, the American presence in Rota saw the relocation of the destroyer squadron that had been based in Athens arrive just as the submarine squadron returned to CONUS. <ref name=\"East\"/> The greater availability of assignments at the Aviation Intermediate Maintenance Depot (AIMD) across the hangar fro the squadron saw an increase in \"homesteading\" (remaining at one location as long as one's career would allow) by enlisted personnel as the rate of intermarriage with Spanish host nationals increased.\n\nThe EC-121Ms' career in the command had been a second lease on life since the airframes when acquired by VQ-2On 31 July 1971 were over ten years old<ref name=\":2\" /><ref name=\"VQH\" />. These twenty-year plus planes were failing to meet the reconnaissance demands placed upon the squadron. On 31 July 1971, the squadron received its first delivery of the [[Lockheed EP-3|EP-3E Aries]] aircraft.<ref name=\":0\" /> These EP-3s were converted from [[Lockheed P-3 Orion|P-3A and P-3B]] airframes. This relatively newer airframe gave the squadron a more reliable platform due to its commonality with the VP P-3s, the availability of parts, and the lower flight hours on the aircraft. It would take five years until the final EP-3E arrived in Rota. By the end of 1974, enough Aries were in Rota to let VQ-2 to stop operating its EC-121Ms. \n\nIn May of 1972, VQ-2 also received a TA-3B and a UP-3A to use for crew training and logistics. These aircraft flew regularly from Rota on local flights as well as airlifts and parts runs to various detachments ashore and afloat. Of note, after 1974, the detachment at Incirlik, relocated to [[Hellenikon Air Base|Athens]]. Due to Greece's popularity with British vacationers, the squadron saw an increase in intermarriage between its sailors and British nationals as well as with host nation citizens.\n\n===Continued Crisis===\n\nIn this decade, the Cold War continued with a lessening of tensions with the Soviet Union due to the Nixon administration's police of the [[D\u00e9tente|d\u00e9tente]]. While this reduced the frequency of operations in the North Atlantic, Baltic, and Germany, the decade was frequently marked by international crises in the Mediterranean. Notable among these were the fallout from [[1969 Libyan coup d'\u00e9tat| the 1969 coup in Libya]], the [[Black September|1970 Jordan Crisis]], the [[Yom Kippur War|1973 Yom Kippur War]], the [[1974 Cypriot coup d'\u00e9tat|1974 crisis in Cyprus]], and the [[Lebanese Civil War|multiple flareups]] in Lebanon. The US Sixth Fleet and its NATO allies maintained a presence offshore in response to all these crises. \n\nDespite d\u00e9tente, the Soviet Union was conducting a program of providing significant amounts of military hardware to its client states of Libya, Syria, and Egypt. At the same time, the Soviet Navy continued increasing its presence in the Mediterranean. While Egypt left the Soviet fold after the Yom Kippur War, the buildups on the levane and North Africa made the Central and Eastern Mediterranean hot spots for VQ-2's monitoring of Soviet naval units as well as activities ashore. As a result high tempo operations lasted through the decade despite the overall drawdown of the US military after Vietnam.\n\nIn 1979, the [[Iranian Revolution]] saw an increased US presence in the Persian Gulf and Indian Ocean. In response, the Navy maintained at least one carrier battle group in the vicinity of the Gulf. VQ-2 shared the manning of carrier and Diego Garcia detachments.<ref name=\":2\" /><ref name=\"East\" /> This manning would continue until the third phase of the [[Lebanese Civil War]] in 1982.\n\n===Aircraft/Aircrew Losses and Mishaps===\n\nAlthough the decade was less lethal than its predecessor, VQ-2 suffered the twelve aircrew fatalities and lost three aircraft in mishaps.\n# On 26 February 1970, EA-3B (BUNO 144851)<ref name=\"A3BUNO\" /> was lost while operating from the [[USS Franklin D. Roosevelt (CV-42)|USS ''Franklin D. Roosevelt'']] in the Mediterranean. The [[Aircraft catapult|catapult]] system malfunctioned in mid-stroke, also known as a 'cold cat,\" resulting in the Whale \u201cdribbling\u201d off the bow and being run over by the carrier<ref name=\"East\" />. Four of the crew members died in the accident<ref name=\":2\"/> \n# On 8 March 1974, EA-3B (BUNO 142257)<ref name=\"A3BUNO\" /> was lost while operating from the [[USS America (CV-66)|USS ''America '']]  in the Mediterranean. A cable parted in the [[Arresting gear]] when the tailhook caught the wire. The pilot who had begun retarding the throttles to idle as per standard procedure, slammed them forward managing to regain enough airspeed to get the plane off the angle and ditch it in the water off to the port side. This allowed the plane to avoid being run over by the ship. The America's plane guard helicopter recovered all the aircrew. The airframe continued to float forcing the ship to have one of its A-7A' strafe it to sink it as it was deemed a hazard to navigation<ref name=\"A3H\" /> \n# On 9 July 1974, the squadron suffered another A-3 loss when its VIP transport-configured A-3, a TA-3B (BUNO 144863)<ref name=\"A3BUNO\" /> crashed at [[Naples International Airport|Capodichino]] in Naples, Italy on approach. All eight aircrew perished in the crash.\n\nThroughout the remainder of the 1970s, the command suffered no aircraft losses.\n\n==1980s==\n[[File:EA-3B VQ-2 after landing on USS Saratoga (CV-60) c1986.jpg|left|thumb|EA-3B VQ-2 after landing on [[USS Saratoga (CV-60)|USS]] Saratoga inn 1986.]]\nAs VQ-2 entered the mid-1980s, the frenzied pace of operations including [[Operation Mole Cricket 19]](Arab-Israel [[Beqaa Valley|Beqaa]] War), and continuing with 1982 - 1983 [[Multinational Force in Lebanon|Beirut Crisis]] with the [[1983 Beirut barracks bombing|U.S. Marine barracks bombing]], and the [[United States Sixth Fleet|Sixth Fleet]] December [[Multinational Force in Lebanon|1983 air strike into Lebanon]], allowed little leisure time for the squadron.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\nVQ-2 was awarded the [[Navy Expeditionary Medal]] for participation in the Beirut evacuation and operations in the vicinity of [[Libya]] during [[1986 United States bombing of Libya|Operation El Dorado Canyon]], 12\u201317 April 1986.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nOn 25 January 1987, an EA-3B crashed on the USS Nimitz killing all seven crew members.\n\n==1990s==\nIn the summer of 1990, the squadron provided electronic reconnaissance during the evacuation of 2000 non-combatant personnel from war-stricken [[Liberia]] in [[operation Sharp Edge]].<ref name=\":0\" />\n[[File:Lockheed EP-3E Orion (ARIES), USA - Navy AN2094464.jpg|thumb|EP-3E of VQ-2 based at Rota, Spain, seen arriving for [[Royal International Air Tattoo|RIAT]] '92.]]\nFrom August 1990 to April 1991, VQ-2 provided combat reconnaissance during operations [[Gulf War|Desert Shield/Desert Storm]], Proven Force, and [[Operation Provide Comfort|Provide Comfort]].<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nOn 29 June 1991, the first EP-3E Aries II aircraft arrived in Rota and on 20 September 1991, the squadron retired the EA-3B Skywarrior the same year.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nStarting in July 1992, VQ-2 flew support missions with Operations [[Operation Deny Flight|Deny Flight]], Provide Promise, Sharp Guard, Joint Endeavor, Decisive Endeavor, and Deliberate Guard providing combat reconnaissance and intelligence to [[NATO]] and [[United Nations]] forces in the Former [[Yugoslavia]].<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nAs of 1997, VQ-2 operated four EP-3E Aries II aircraft and two [[Lockheed P-3 Orion|P-3C Orion]] aircraft from its home-base at Rota and two-plane detachment at [[Souda Bay|Naval Support Activity Souda Bay, Crete]].<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nIn March 1997, VQ-2 provided electronic reconnaissance during the evacuation of non-combatant personnel from [[Albania]] following unrest from a failed [[Pyramid scheme|pyramid savings scheme]] during [[Operation Silver Wake]].<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n==2000s==\nVQ-2 relocated from NS Rota, Spain, to NAS Whidbey Island, effective 1 September 2005.
