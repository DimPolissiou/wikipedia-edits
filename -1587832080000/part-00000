Major projects including building new refineries, pipelines, expanding the national shipping and airlines as well as hosting FESTAC was done during this administration. A number of these national projects were conduits to distribute favors and enrich connected politicians.

Shortages and subsequent allegations were precipitated by [[protectionism]]. After its election, the Nigerian government decided to protect local rice farmers from imported commodities. A licensing system was created to limit rice imports.

Some cite the suitcases scandal which also coincidentally involved then customs leader [[Atiku Abubakar]], who later became Vice President in 1999, and was indicted for various acts of corruption. \"The 53 suitcases saga arose in 1984 during the currency change exercise ordered by the Buhari junta when it ordered that every case arriving the country should be inspected irrespective of the status of the person behind such. The 53 suitcases were, however, ferried through the [[Murtala Muhammed International Airport|Murtala Muhammed Airport]] without a customs check by soldiers allegedly at the behest of Major Mustapha Jokolo, the then aide-de-camp to Gen.

In 1996, ''The Graduate'' was selected for preservation in the U.S. [[National Film Registry]] as being \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant.\" Initially, the film was placed at No.7 on [[AFI's 100 Years... 100 Movies]] list in 1998. When [[American Film Institute|AFI]] [[AFI's 100 Years...100 Movies (10th Anniversary Edition)|revised the list in 2007]], the film was moved to No.17.\n\n==Plot==\nIn 1967, Benjamin Braddock, aged 20, has earned his [[bachelor's degree]] from a college on the [[East Coast of the United States|East Coast]] and has returned home to a party celebrating his [[graduation]] at his parents' house in [[Pasadena, California]]. Benjamin has no idea of what to do with his life and is visibly unhappy as his parents deliver accolades and neighborhood friends ask him about his future plans. He hides from those who try to congratulate him. Mrs. Robinson, the wife of his father's law partner, insists that he drive her home. Benjamin is persuaded inside to have a drink and Mrs. Robinson attempts to seduce him. She invites him up to her daughter Elaine's room to see Elaine's portrait and then enters the room naked, making it clear that she is available to him. Benjamin rejects her but a few days later, he awkwardly organizes a meeting at the Taft Hotel, where he registers under the pseudonym Gladstone.\n\nBenjamin spends the rest of the summer relaxing around the pool by day, refusing to select a graduate school, and seeing Mrs. Robinson at the hotel by night. He discovers that he and Mrs. Robinson have nothing to talk about. However, after Benjamin pesters her one evening, Mrs. Robinson reveals that she entered into a loveless marriage when she accidentally became pregnant with Elaine. Both Mr. Robinson and Benjamin's parents encourage him to call Elaine, but, in private, Mrs. Robinson forbids him.\n\nBenjamin decides to take Elaine on a date in order to  ruin it: he ignores her, drives dangerously, and takes her to a strip club. After she runs out of the club in tears, he changes his mind, apologizes for his behavior, and discovers that Elaine is someone he is happy to be around. In search of a late-night drink they visit the Taft Hotel, but when the staff greet Benjamin as \"Mr. Gladstone\", Elaine deduces that he has been having an affair with a married woman. She accepts his acknowledgement that the affair is over, but an angry Mrs. Robinson threatens to tell Elaine her version of their affair. To prevent this, Benjamin tells Elaine that the married woman was her mother.\n\nElaine is disgusted and returns to school at [[University of California, Berkeley|Berkeley]]. Benjamin follows her there and tries to charm her. She reveals that her mother's story is that he [[rape]]d her while she was [[Alcohol intoxication|drunk]], and she refuses to believe that her mother actually seduced Benjamin.\n\nAfter [[stalking]] her for several days and continuously proposing to her, Benjamin begins to make amends with Elaine. However, Mr. Robinson arrives at Berkeley after learning about the affair, confronts Benjamin at his rooming house, and threatens to put him behind bars if Benjamin sees his daughter again. Mr. Robinson then forces Elaine to drop out of college and takes her away to marry Carl, a classmate with whom she briefly had a relationship.\n\nReturning to Pasadena in search of Elaine, Benjamin breaks into the Robinson home but encounters Mrs. Robinson. She tells him he will not be able to stop the wedding with Carl and then calls the police, claiming that her house is being burglarized.\n\nBenjamin visits Carl's fraternity brothers who tell him that the wedding is in [[Santa Barbara, California|Santa Barbara]] that morning. He rushes to the church and arrives just as Elaine is married, witnessing the kiss. He bangs on the glass at the back of the church and screams \"Elaine!\" frantically. After hesitating, Elaine screams \"Ben!\" and looks at him pitifully. He rushes toward her, and a fight ensues as guests try to stop the two from leaving together. Elaine manages to break free from her mother, who then slaps her. Benjamin manages to keep the guests at bay by picking up a large cross and wielding it, then jamming the church doors shut with it. Both he and Elaine then run into the street to flag down a passing bus and take the back seat, [[Elopement|eloping]].\n\nHowever, as they settle into their seats, their faces change from happiness to uncertainty as \"[[The Sound of Silence]]\" plays.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col}}\n* [[Anne Bancroft]] as Mrs. Robinson\n* [[Dustin Hoffman]] as Benjamin Braddock\n* [[Katharine Ross]] as Elaine Robinson\n* [[William Daniels]] as Mr. Braddock\n* [[Murray Hamilton]] as Mr. Robinson\n* [[Elizabeth Wilson]] as Mrs. Braddock\n* [[Buck Henry]] as Room clerk\n* Brian Avery as Carl Smith\n* [[Walter Brooke]] as Mr. McGuire\n* [[Norman Fell]] as Mr. McCleery\n* [[Alice Ghostley]] as Mrs. Singleman\n* [[Marion Lorne]] as Miss DeWitte\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Production==\n\n===Casting===\nNichols' first choice for Mrs. Robinson was French actress [[Jeanne Moreau]].<ref>The audio commentary by Mike Nichols and Steven Soderbergh in Criterion Collection BD and DVD.</ref> The idea behind this was that in the French culture, the \"older\" women tended to \"train\" the younger men in sexual matters (it is a cliche). There were numerous actors considered or tested for, or who wanted, roles in the film. [[Doris Day]] turned down an offer because the nudity required by the role offended her.<ref name=mcgee>{{cite book| title=Doris Day: Sentimental Journey| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cfbcA3zFlNgC&pg=PT326&dq=doris+day+graduate&hl=en&sa=X&ei=y-8UU9-RNOfN0wHi5IHQAg&ved=0CEYQ6AEwAw#v=onepage&q=graduate&f=false| last=McGee| first=Garry| date=November 22, 2011| page=160| publisher=McFarland| isbn=978-0-7864-6107-3| accessdate=2014-03-03}}</ref> [[Joan Crawford]] inquired as to play the part, while [[Lauren Bacall]] and [[Audrey Hepburn]] both wanted the role. [[Patricia Neal]] turned down the film as she had recently recovered from a stroke and did not feel ready to accept such a major role. [[Geraldine Page]] also turned it down. Other actors considered for the part included [[Claire Bloom]], [[Angie Dickinson]], [[Sophia Loren]], [[Judy Garland]], [[Rita Hayworth]], [[Susan Hayward]], [[Anouk Aim\u00e9e]], [[Jennifer Jones]], [[Deborah Kerr]], [[Eva Marie Saint]], [[Rosalind Russell]], [[Simone Signoret]], [[Jean Simmons]], [[Lana Turner]], [[Eleanor Parker]], [[Anne Baxter]] and [[Shelley Winters]]. [[Angela Lansbury]] also asked about playing the part. [[Ava Gardner]] sought the role of Mrs. Robinson, and reportedly called Nichols saying,\"I want to see you! I want to talk about this ''Graduate'' thing!\" Nichols did not seriously consider her for the role (he wanted a younger woman as Bancroft was 35 and Gardner was 45), but did end up visiting her hotel. He later recounted that \"she sat at a little French desk with a telephone, she went through every movie star clich\u00e9. She said, 'All right, let's talk about your movie. First of all, I strip for nobody.'\" Meanwhile, [[Natalie Wood]] turned down not only the role of Mrs. Robinson, but also that of Elaine.\n\nFor the character of Elaine, casting was also an issue. [[Patty Duke]] turned down the part as she did not want to work at the time. [[Faye Dunaway]] was also considered for Elaine, but had to turn it down, in favor of ''[[Bonnie and Clyde (film)|Bonnie and Clyde]]''. [[Sally Field]] and [[Shirley MacLaine]] refused the role as well. [[Raquel Welch]] and [[Joan Collins]] both wanted the role, but did not succeed in getting it. [[Carroll Baker]] tested, but was said to have been too old to portray Anne Bancroft's daughter. [[Candice Bergen]] screen-tested as well, as did [[Goldie Hawn]] and [[Jane Fonda]]. Additionally, [[Ann-Margret]], [[Elizabeth Ashley]], [[Carol Lynley]], [[Sue Lyon]], [[Yvette Mimieux]], [[Suzanne Pleshette]], [[Lee Remick]], [[Pamela Tiffin]], [[Julie Christie]], and [[Tuesday Weld]] were all on the director's shortlist before [[Katharine Ross]] was cast.\n\nWhen [[Dustin Hoffman]] auditioned for the role of Benjamin, he was just short of his 30th birthday at the time of filming. He was asked to perform a love scene with Ross, having previously never done one during his acting classes and believed that, as he said later, \"a girl like [Ross] would never go for a guy like me in a million years.\" Ross agreed, believing that Hoffman \"look[ed] about 3 feet tall ... so unkempt. This is going to be a disaster.\" Producer [[Joseph E. Levine]] later admitted that he at first believed that Hoffman \"was one of the messenger boys.\" Despite&mdash;or perhaps because of\u2014Hoffman's awkwardness, Nichols chose him for the film.<ref name=\"life19671124\">{{cite news| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=eEkEAAAAMBAJ&lpg=PA71&pg=PA111#v=onepage&f=true| title=The Graduate| work=[[Life (magazine)|Life]]| date=24 November 1967| accessdate=2014-03-03| last=Zeitlin| first=David| page=111}}</ref> \"As far as I'm concerned, Mike Nichols did a very courageous thing casting me in a part that I was not right for, meaning I was Jewish,\" said Hoffman. \"In fact, many of the reviews were very negative.

Beatty turned the film down as he was occupied with ''[[Bonnie and Clyde (film)|Bonnie and Clyde]]''. Redford tested for the part of Benjamin (with [[Candice Bergen]] as Elaine), but Nichols thought Redford did not possess the underdog quality Benjamin needed.<ref name=kashner>{{cite magazine | title=Here's to You, Mr. Nichols: The Making of ''The Graduate'' | url=https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2008/03/graduate200803 | last=Kashner| first=Sam | work=[[Vanity Fair (magazine)|Vanity Fair]] | date=March 2008 | accessdate=2018-11-27}}</ref>\n\nIn the role of Mr. Robinson, [[Gene Hackman]] was originally cast, but just before filming began, the director decided he was too young and decided to replace him. [[Marlon Brando]], [[Howard Duff]], [[Brian Keith]], [[George Peppard]], [[Jack Palance]], [[Frank Sinatra]], [[Walter Matthau]] and [[Gregory Peck]] were all other choices for the role that [[Murray Hamilton]] eventually played. [[Susan Hayward]] was the first choice for Benjamin's mother, Mrs. Braddock, but the role was given to [[Elizabeth Wilson]]. And to play Mr. Braddock, [[Yul Brynner]], [[Kirk Douglas]], [[Jack Lemmon]], [[Robert Mitchum]], [[Karl Malden]], [[Christopher Plummer]] and [[Ronald Reagan]] (who had been [[Governor of California]] for nearly a year when the film was released) all came close to getting the role that ended up going to [[William Daniels]].<ref name=kashner />\n\n===Filming locations===\nMany of the exterior university campus shots of Berkeley were actually filmed on the brick campus of [[University of Southern California|USC]] in [[Los Angeles]].<ref name=USCfilming>{{cite web |title=USC's Lists & Urban Legends: Just a Few of the Feature Films Shot on the University Park Campus |url=http://www.usc.edu/dept/pubrel/trojan_family/spring06/Lists.html |last=Moore |first=Annette |work=USC Trojan Family Magazine |date=Spring 2006 |accessdate=2014-03-03 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130527071350/http://www.usc.edu/dept/pubrel/trojan_family/spring06/Lists.html |archivedate=May 27, 2013 |df=mdy-all }}</ref>\n\nThe church used for the wedding scene is actually the [[United Methodist Church]] in [[La Verne, California|La Verne]]. In a commentary audio released with the 40th anniversary DVD, Hoffman revealed that he was uneasy about the scene in which he pounds on the church window, as the minister of the [[Church (building)|church]] had been watching the filming disapprovingly. The wedding scene was highly influenced by the ending of the 1924 comedy film ''[[Girl Shy]]'' starring [[Harold Lloyd]], who also served as an advisor for the scene in ''The Graduate''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.brownpapertickets.com/event/1443795|title=Silent Salon 2015 // Girl Shy|publisher=brownpapertickets.com}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.doctormacro.com/Movie%20Summaries/G/Girl%20Shy.htm|title=Girl Shy|publisher=doctormacro.com}}</ref>\n\n===Music===\n{{See also|The Graduate (soundtrack)}}\nThe film boosted the profile of [[folk-rock]] duo [[Simon & Garfunkel]]. Originally, Nichols and O'Steen used their existing songs like \"[[The Sound of Silence]]\" merely as a pacing device for the editing until Nichols decided that substituting original music would not be effective and decided to include them on the soundtrack, an unusual move at that time.<ref name=harris>{{cite book |last=Harris |first=Mark |title=Pictures at a Revolution |url=https://archive.org/details/picturesatrevolu00harr_0/page/360 |date=February 14, 2008 |publisher=The Penguin Press |pages=[https://archive.org/details/picturesatrevolu00harr_0/page/360 360\u20131] |isbn=978-1-5942-0152-3 |url-access=registration }}</ref>\n\nAccording to a ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' article by [[Peter Bart]] in the May 15, 2005, issue, [[Lawrence Turman]], his producer, then made a deal for Simon to write three new songs for the movie. By the time they had nearly finished editing the film, Simon had only written one new song. Nichols begged him for more, but Simon, who was touring constantly, told him he did not have the time. He did play him a few notes of a new song he had been working on; \"It's not for the movie... it's a song about times past\u2014about [[Eleanor Roosevelt|Mrs. Roosevelt]] and [[Joe DiMaggio]] and stuff.\" Nichols advised Simon, \"It's now about [[Mrs. Robinson]], not Mrs. Roosevelt.\"<ref name=bart>{{cite news |url=https://variety.com/2005/film/columns/the-perfect-pic-alignment-1117922805/ |work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] |first=Peter |last=Bart |author-link=Peter Bart |title=The perfect pic alignment |date=May 15, 2005}}</ref>\n\n==Reception==\n\n===Critical response===\n''The Graduate'' was met with generally positive reviews from critics upon its release.

In 1996, ''The Graduate'' was selected for preservation in the U.S. [[National Film Registry]] as being \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant.\" Initially, the film was placed at No.7 on [[AFI's 100 Years... 100 Movies]] list in 1998. When [[American Film Institute|AFI]] [[AFI's 100 Years...100 Movies (10th Anniversary Edition)|revised the list in 2007]], the film was moved to No.17.\n\n==Plot==\nIn 1967, Benjamin Braddock, aged 20, has earned his [[bachelor's degree]] from a college on the [[East Coast of the United States|East Coast]] and has returned home to a party celebrating his [[graduation]] at his parents' house in [[Pasadena, California]]. Benjamin has no idea of what to do with his life and is visibly unhappy as his parents deliver accolades and neighborhood friends ask him about his future plans. He hides from those who try to congratulate him. Mrs. Robinson, the wife of his father's law partner, insists that he drive her home. Benjamin is persuaded inside to have a drink and Mrs. Robinson attempts to seduce him. She invites him up to her daughter Elaine's room to see Elaine's portrait and then enters the room naked, making it clear that she is available to him. Benjamin rejects her but a few days later, he awkwardly organizes a meeting at the Taft Hotel, where he registers under the pseudonym Gladstone.\n\nBenjamin spends the rest of the summer relaxing around the pool by day, refusing to select a graduate school, and seeing Mrs. Robinson at the hotel by night. He discovers that he and Mrs. Robinson have nothing to talk about. However, after Benjamin pesters her one evening, Mrs. Robinson reveals that she entered into a loveless marriage when she accidentally became pregnant with Elaine. Both Mr. Robinson and Benjamin's parents encourage him to call Elaine, but, in private, Mrs. Robinson forbids him.\n\nBenjamin decides to take Elaine on a date in order to  ruin it: he ignores her, drives dangerously, and takes her to a strip club. After she runs out of the club in tears, he changes his mind, apologizes for his behavior, and discovers that Elaine is someone he is happy to be around. In search of a late-night drink they visit the Taft Hotel, but when the staff greet Benjamin as \"Mr. Gladstone\", Elaine deduces that he has been having an affair with a married woman. She accepts his acknowledgement that the affair is over, but an angry Mrs. Robinson threatens to tell Elaine her version of their affair. To prevent this, Benjamin tells Elaine that the married woman was her mother.\n\nElaine is disgusted and returns to school at [[University of California, Berkeley|Berkeley]]. Benjamin follows her there and tries to charm her. She reveals that her mother's story is that he [[rape]]d her while she was [[Alcohol intoxication|drunk]], and she refuses to believe that her mother actually seduced Benjamin.\n\nAfter [[stalking]] her for several days and continuously proposing to her, Benjamin begins to make amends with Elaine. However, Mr. Robinson arrives at Berkeley after learning about the affair, confronts Benjamin at his rooming house, and threatens to put him behind bars if Benjamin sees his daughter again. Mr. Robinson then forces Elaine to drop out of college and takes her away to marry Carl, a classmate with whom she briefly had a relationship.\n\nReturning to Pasadena in search of Elaine, Benjamin breaks into the Robinson home but encounters Mrs. Robinson. She tells him he will not be able to stop the wedding with Carl and then calls the police, claiming that her house is being burglarized.\n\nBenjamin visits Carl's fraternity brothers who tell him that the wedding is in [[Santa Barbara, California|Santa Barbara]] that morning. He rushes to the church and arrives just as Elaine is married, witnessing the kiss. He bangs on the glass at the back of the church and screams \"Elaine!\" frantically. After hesitating, Elaine screams \"Ben!\" and looks at him pitifully. He rushes toward her, and a fight ensues as guests try to stop the two from leaving together. Elaine manages to break free from her mother, who then slaps her. Benjamin manages to keep the guests at bay by picking up a large cross and wielding it, then jamming the church doors shut with it. Both he and Elaine then run into the street to flag down a passing bus and take the back seat, [[Elopement|eloping]].\n\nHowever, as they settle into their seats, their faces change from happiness to uncertainty as \"[[The Sound of Silence]]\" plays.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col}}\n* [[Anne Bancroft]] as Mrs. Robinson\n* [[Dustin Hoffman]] as Benjamin Braddock\n* [[Katharine Ross]] as Elaine Robinson\n* [[William Daniels]] as Mr. Braddock\n* [[Murray Hamilton]] as Mr. Robinson\n* [[Elizabeth Wilson]] as Mrs. Braddock\n* [[Buck Henry]] as Room clerk\n* Brian Avery as Carl Smith\n* [[Walter Brooke]] as Mr. McGuire\n* [[Norman Fell]] as Mr. McCleery\n* [[Alice Ghostley]] as Mrs. Singleman\n* [[Marion Lorne]] as Miss DeWitte\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Production==\n\n===Casting===\nNichols' first choice for Mrs. Robinson was French actress [[Jeanne Moreau]].<ref>The audio commentary by Mike Nichols and Steven Soderbergh in Criterion Collection BD and DVD.</ref> The idea behind this was that in the French culture, the \"older\" women tended to \"train\" the younger men in sexual matters (it is a cliche).

Other actors considered for the part included [[Claire Bloom]], [[Angie Dickinson]], [[Sophia Loren]], [[Judy Garland]], [[Rita Hayworth]], [[Susan Hayward]], [[Anouk Aim\u00e9e]], [[Jennifer Jones]], [[Deborah Kerr]], [[Eva Marie Saint]], [[Rosalind Russell]], [[Simone Signoret]], [[Jean Simmons]], [[Lana Turner]], [[Eleanor Parker]], [[Anne Baxter]] and [[Shelley Winters]]. [[Angela Lansbury]] also asked about playing the part. [[Ava Gardner]] sought the role of Mrs. Robinson, and reportedly called Nichols saying,\"I want to see you! I want to talk about this ''Graduate'' thing!\" Nichols did not seriously consider her for the role (he wanted a younger woman as Bancroft was 35 and Gardner was 45), but did end up visiting her hotel. He later recounted that \"she sat at a little French desk with a telephone, she went through every movie star clich\u00e9. She said, 'All right, let's talk about your movie. First of all, I strip for nobody.'\" Meanwhile, [[Natalie Wood]] turned down not only the role of Mrs. Robinson, but also that of Elaine.\n\nFor the character of Elaine, casting was also an issue. [[Patty Duke]] turned down the part as she did not want to work at the time. [[Faye Dunaway]] was also considered for Elaine, but had to turn it down, in favor of ''[[Bonnie and Clyde (film)|Bonnie and Clyde]]''. [[Sally Field]] and [[Shirley MacLaine]] refused the role as well. [[Raquel Welch]] and [[Joan Collins]] both wanted the role, but did not succeed in getting it. [[Carroll Baker]] tested, but was said to have been too old to portray Anne Bancroft's daughter. [[Candice Bergen]] screen-tested as well, as did [[Goldie Hawn]] and [[Jane Fonda]]. Additionally, [[Ann-Margret]], [[Elizabeth Ashley]], [[Carol Lynley]], [[Sue Lyon]], [[Yvette Mimieux]], [[Suzanne Pleshette]], [[Lee Remick]], [[Pamela Tiffin]], [[Julie Christie]], and [[Tuesday Weld]] were all on the director's shortlist before [[Katharine Ross]] was cast.\n\nWhen [[Dustin Hoffman]] auditioned for the role of Benjamin, he was just short of his 30th birthday at the time of filming. He was asked to perform a love scene with Ross, having previously never done one during his acting classes and believed that, as he said later, \"a girl like [Ross] would never go for a guy like me in a million years.\" Ross agreed, believing that Hoffman \"look[ed] about 3 feet tall ... so unkempt. This is going to be a disaster.\" Producer [[Joseph E. Levine]] later admitted that he at first believed that Hoffman \"was one of the messenger boys.\" Despite&mdash;or perhaps because of\u2014Hoffman's awkwardness, Nichols chose him for the film.<ref name=\"life19671124\">{{cite news| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=eEkEAAAAMBAJ&lpg=PA71&pg=PA111#v=onepage&f=true| title=The Graduate| work=[[Life (magazine)|Life]]| date=24 November 1967| accessdate=2014-03-03| last=Zeitlin| first=David| page=111}}</ref> \"As far as I'm concerned, Mike Nichols did a very courageous thing casting me in a part that I was not right for, meaning I was Jewish,\" said Hoffman. \"In fact, many of the reviews were very negative.

[[Susan Hayward]] was the first choice for Benjamin's mother, Mrs. Braddock, but the role was given to [[Elizabeth Wilson]]. And to play Mr. Braddock, [[Yul Brynner]], [[Kirk Douglas]], [[Jack Lemmon]], [[Robert Mitchum]], [[Karl Malden]], [[Christopher Plummer]] and [[Ronald Reagan]] (who had been [[Governor of California]] for nearly a year when the film was released) all came close to getting the role that ended up going to [[William Daniels]].<ref name=kashner />\n\n===Filming locations===\nMany of the exterior university campus shots of Berkeley were actually filmed on the brick campus of [[University of Southern California|USC]] in [[Los Angeles]].<ref name=USCfilming>{{cite web |title=USC's Lists & Urban Legends: Just a Few of the Feature Films Shot on the University Park Campus |url=http://www.usc.edu/dept/pubrel/trojan_family/spring06/Lists.html |last=Moore |first=Annette |work=USC Trojan Family Magazine |date=Spring 2006 |accessdate=2014-03-03 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130527071350/http://www.usc.edu/dept/pubrel/trojan_family/spring06/Lists.html |archivedate=May 27, 2013 |df=mdy-all }}</ref>\n\nThe church used for the wedding scene is actually the [[United Methodist Church]] in [[La Verne, California|La Verne]]. In a commentary audio released with the 40th anniversary DVD, Hoffman revealed that he was uneasy about the scene in which he pounds on the church window, as the minister of the [[Church (building)|church]] had been watching the filming disapprovingly. The wedding scene was highly influenced by the ending of the 1924 comedy film ''[[Girl Shy]]'' starring [[Harold Lloyd]], who also served as an advisor for the scene in ''The Graduate''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.brownpapertickets.com/event/1443795|title=Silent Salon 2015 // Girl Shy|publisher=brownpapertickets.com}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.doctormacro.com/Movie%20Summaries/G/Girl%20Shy.htm|title=Girl Shy|publisher=doctormacro.com}}</ref>\n\n===Music===\n{{See also|The Graduate (soundtrack)}}\nThe film boosted the profile of [[folk-rock]] duo [[Simon & Garfunkel]].

He did play him a few notes of a new song he had been working on; \"It's not for the movie... it's a song about times past\u2014about [[Eleanor Roosevelt|Mrs. Roosevelt]] and [[Joe DiMaggio]] and stuff.\" Nichols advised Simon, \"It's now about [[Mrs. Robinson]], not Mrs. Roosevelt.\"<ref name=bart>{{cite news |url=https://variety.com/2005/film/columns/the-perfect-pic-alignment-1117922805/ |work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] |first=Peter |last=Bart |author-link=Peter Bart |title=The perfect pic alignment |date=May 15, 2005}}</ref>\n\n==Reception==\n\n===Critical response===\n''The Graduate'' was met with generally positive reviews from critics upon its release.

It is based on the [[DC Comics]] [[superhero]] [[Courtney Whitmore|of the same name]] created by Johns and Lee Moder. The series follows Courtney Whitmore, portrayed by [[Brec Bassinger]], who discovers the cosmic staff and becomes the inspiration for a new generation of superheroes who become the [[Justice Society of America]].\n\nDC Universe ordered the series in July 2018. Bassinger was cast in September 2018, with additional castings for her family members, the Justice Society of America, and the [[Injustice Society]] through February 2019. Filming for the series began by March 2019 in the [[Atlanta metropolitan area]] in Georgia.\n\n''Stargirl'' is set to premiere on May 18, 2020. The series will also air the following day on [[The CW]], as well as be available on The CW's digital platforms. Ahead of the series premiere, characters from the series were featured in the [[Arrowverse]] crossover \"[[Crisis on Infinite Earths (Arrowverse)|Crisis on Infinite Earths]]\", establishing ''Stargirl'' as existing on [[Earth-2 (Arrowverse post-Crisis)|a parallel Earth to the Arrowverse series]].\n\n==Premise==\nHigh school sophomore [[Courtney Whitmore]] discovers a powerful cosmic staff, and after learning that her step-father [[Pat Dugan]] used to be a hero sidekick, becomes the inspiration for a new generation of superheroes.<ref name=\"Bassinger\" />\n\n==Cast and characters==\n===Main===\n<!-- Order per https://cwtvpr.com/the-cw/shows/dcs-stargirl/about and other actors sourced as main until opening credits are revealed -->\n* [[Brec Bassinger]] as [[Courtney Whitmore|Courtney Whitmore / Stargirl]]:<br />A high school sophomore who discovers a powerful cosmic staff and becomes the hero Stargirl.<ref name=\"Bassinger\" /> She is the leader of the new [[Justice Society of America]].<ref name=\"IGNJSAReveal\" /> Bassinger did not look at the previous portrayals of the character by [[Britt Irvin]] on ''[[Smallville]]'' or [[Sarah Grey]] on ''[[Legends of Tomorrow]]'' because they were depicted as \"older, more mature version[s]\" of Stargirl.

The pilot is set to be written by [[Geoff Johns]] who will executive produce alongside [[Greg Berlanti]], [[Sarah Schechter]], and Melissa Carter (who is co-showrunner with Johns).<ref name=\"SeriesOrder\" /><ref name=\"The CW\" /> Production companies involved with the series are Mad Ghost Productions, Berlanti Productions, and [[Warner Bros. Television]]. The series was said to be a \"reimagining\" of [[Courtney Whitmore|Stargirl]].<ref name=\"SeriesOrder\" />\n\n===Writing===\nJohns described ''Stargirl'' as having a similar tone to 1980s films such as ''[[E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial]]'' and ''[[Back to the Future]]''. The start of the series sees the deaths of the original members of the [[Justice Society of America]] (JSA). With the younger generation taking up their mantle, Johns said their \"paths aren't complete. They don't know where they're going to be or what they're going to be. And so, there's all sorts of mistakes they can make and choices they can make, and who knows what their ultimate destiny will be?... It makes for a lot of fun and a lot of unpredictability.\" The members of the [[Injustice Society]] mirrors those on the JSA team, with Johns teasing that just about everyone who has been a member of the Injustice Society in the comics would appear in the series. Speaking to classic JSA members such as [[Alan Scott]] and [[Flash (Jay Garrick)|Jay Garrick]], Johns called them the \"elderly statesmen\" and that they \"are spoken of and they exist in the JSA\" with \"their legacies... felt throughout the show\". There were also \"plans in the future for things\".

The pilot is set to be written by [[Geoff Johns]] who will executive produce alongside [[Greg Berlanti]], [[Sarah Schechter]], and Melissa Carter (who is co-showrunner with Johns).<ref name=\"SeriesOrder\" /><ref name=\"The CW\" /> Production companies involved with the series are Mad Ghost Productions, Berlanti Productions, and [[Warner Bros. Television]]. The series was said to be a \"reimagining\" of [[Courtney Whitmore|Stargirl]].<ref name=\"SeriesOrder\" />\n\n===Writing===\nJohns described ''Stargirl'' as having a similar tone to 1980s films such as ''[[E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial]]'' and ''[[Back to the Future]]''. The start of the series sees the deaths of the original members of the [[Justice Society of America]] (JSA). With the younger generation taking up their mantle, Johns said their \"paths aren't complete. They don't know where they're going to be or what they're going to be. And so, there's all sorts of mistakes they can make and choices they can make, and who knows what their ultimate destiny will be?... It makes for a lot of fun and a lot of unpredictability.\" The members of the [[Injustice Society]] mirrors those on the JSA team, with Johns teasing that just about everyone who has been a member of the Injustice Society in the comics would appear in the series. Speaking to classic JSA members such as [[Alan Scott]] and [[Flash (Jay Garrick)|Jay Garrick]], Johns called them the \"elderly statesmen\" and that they \"are spoken of and they exist in the JSA\" with \"their legacies... felt throughout the show\". There were also \"plans in the future for things\". For the first season, star [[Brec Bassinger]] felt the original [[Charles McNider|Doctor Mid-Nite, Charles McNider]] would have \"a significant role to play\", while Johns added the season would establish the [[Seven Soldiers of Victory]] as the first superhero team before the JSA and explore the history of the Cosmic Staff.<ref name=\"IGNJSAReveal\" />\n\n===Casting===\nIn September 2018, it was announced that [[Brec Bassinger]] had been cast as [[Courtney Whitmore|Courtney Whitmore / Stargirl]].<ref name=\"Bassinger\" /> Johns called the casting of Stargirl a difficult process, auditioning hundreds of actress for the role. On why Bassinger was perfect for the role, Johns said, \"Immediately... I knew she was Courtney. She has the humor, she has the enthusiasm, the energy, the innate optimism, and Brec really embodies who Stargirl is\".<ref name=\"IGNJSAReveal\" /> In November 2018, the following roles were cast: Anjelika Washington as [[Doctor Mid-Nite#Beth Chapel|Beth Chapel / Doctor Mid-Nite]],<ref name=\"Washington\" /><ref name=\"IGNJSAReveal\" /> [[Yvette Monreal]] as [[Wildcat (Yolanda Montez)|Yolanda Montez / Wildcat]], and Christopher James Baker as [[Brainwave (comics)|Henry King / Brainwave]].<ref name=\"MonrealBaker\" /><ref name=\"IGNJSAReveal\" /> The next month, [[Joy Osmanski]] was cast as [[Tigress (DC Comics)|Paula Brooks / Tigress]], [[Neil Hopkins]] was cast as [[Sportsmaster|Lawrence \u201cCrusher\u201d Crock / Sportsmaster]], and [[Nelson Lee]] was cast as [[Dragon King (DC Comics)|Dr. Ito / Dragon King]], members of the [[Injustice Society]].<ref name=\"InjusticeSociety\" /><ref name=\"IGNJSAReveal\" /> In January 2019, [[Luke Wilson]] was cast as [[Pat Dugan|Pat Dugan / S.T.R.I.P.E.]]<ref name=\"Wilson\" /> Cameron Gellman joined the cast as [[Hourman (Rick Tyler)|Rick Tyler / Hourman]] the next month,<ref name=\"Gellman\" /><ref name=\"IGNJSAReveal\" /> along with [[Amy Smart]] as Barbara Whitmore,<ref name=\"Final4Starring\" /> [[Neil Jackson]] as [[Icicle (comics)|Jordan Mahkent / Icicle]],<ref name=\"Final4Starring\" /><ref name=\"IGNJSAReveal\" /> Trae Romano as Mike Dugan,<ref name=\"Final4Starring\" /> and Hunter Sansone as Cameron.<ref name=\"Final4Starring\" /><ref name=\"SansoneCWBio\" /> In February 2019, Jake Austin Walker was cast as Henry King Jr. and Meg Delacy was cast as Cindy Burman, rounding out the cast.<ref name=\"WalkerDeLacy\" /><ref name=\"WalkerCWBio\" />\n\nIn December 2018, the following members of the [[Justice Society of America]] were cast, all recurring roles: [[Joel McHale]] as [[Sylvester Pemberton|Sylvester Pemberton / Starman]],<ref name=\"McHale\" /> [[Lou Ferrigno, Jr.]] as [[Hourman (Rex Tyler)|Rex Tyler / Hourman]],<ref name=\"Ferrigno\" /> Brian Stapf as [[Wildcat (Ted Grant)|Ted Grant / Wildcat]],<ref name=\"Stapf\" /> and [[Henry Thomas]] as [[Charles McNider|Charles McNider / Doctor Mid-Nite]].<ref name=\"Thomas\" /> In April 2019, Hina Khan was cast in an undisclosed role said to be a principal.<ref name=\"Khan\" />\n\n===Filming===\nFilming had begun by March 14, 2019,<ref name=\"AtlantaFilmingStart\" /> with [[Glen Winter]] directing the pilot.<ref name=\"Winter\" /> Scott Peck was a director of photography on the series.<ref name=\"PeckDP\" /> Filming occurs throughout the [[Atlanta metropolitan area]], including: [[Marietta, Georgia|Marietta]], [[Virginia\u2013Highland]], [[Duluth, Georgia|Duluth]], [[Lithia Springs, Georgia|Lithia Springs]], [[Dallas, Georgia|Dallas]],<ref name=\"AtlantaFilmingStart\" /> [[Marietta Square]], [[West End, Atlanta|West End]], [[Westlake High School (Georgia)|Westlake High School]], the Atlanta Center for Medical Research,<ref name=\"AtlantaFilming2\" /> Campbell Middle School, [[Paulding County, Georgia|Paulding County]], [[Smyrna, Georgia|Smyrna]], [[Arbor Place]] Mall, [[Vinings, Georgia|Vinings]],<ref name=\"AtlantaFilming3\" /> [[Mableton, Georgia|Mableton]], and [[Douglas County High School (Douglasville, Georgia)|Douglas County High School]].<ref name=\"AtlantaFilming4\" />\n\n===Music===\nIn June 2019, [[Pinar Toprak]] revealed she would be composing for the series.<ref name=\"Toprak\" />\n\n==Release==\n''Stargirl'' is scheduled to begin airing on DC Universe on May 18, 2020.<ref name=\"NewRelease\" /> The series was originally intended to begin airing on May 11, 2020.<ref name=\"OriginalReleaseDate\" /> In November 2019, it was announced that [[The CW]] would broadcast each episode the day after it premieres on the streaming service, with each episode available to stream on The CW's online platforms after its broadcast.<ref name=\"The CW\" /> It will start airing on The CW on May 19, 2020, at 8 pm.<ref name=\"NewRelease\" /> The series will air in [[4K resolution|4K]] [[Ultra-high-definition television|Ultra HD]] on DC Universe.<ref name=\"DCUniverse4K\" />\n\n===Marketing===\nOn December 7, 2019, a teaser trailer was released.<ref name=\"FirstTrailer\" />\n\n==Arrowverse==\n{{Main|Crisis on Infinite Earths (Arrowverse)}}\nStargirl and her team were briefly introduced in the [[Arrowverse]] crossover \"[[Crisis on Infinite Earths (Arrowverse)|Crisis on Infinite Earths]]\" in January 2020. ''Stargirl'' is set on a new [[Earth-2 (Arrowverse post-Crisis)|Earth-2]], created during the crossover.<ref name=\"ScreenRantCrisis\" /><ref name=\"ScreenRantCrisis2\" /> Stargirl had previously appeared in three episodes of [[Legends of Tomorrow (season 2)|season two]] of ''[[Legends of Tomorrow]]'', portrayed by [[Sarah Grey]], between October 2016 and February 2017.<ref name=\"LegendsStargirl\" />\n\nRegarding any proper crossovers with the Arrowverse, Johns and Bassinger were keen on the idea. In April 2020, Johns said, \"right now the main concern is making sure that this show is great, that these characters are great, that they have their own stories and they get the proper screen time and the proper episodes to develop on their own. So hopefully in the future we can do something fun, but the first season is all about making sure that ''Stargirl'' is the best show it can possibly be.\" Bassinger added that there had already been preliminary discussion about crossing over with ''[[The Flash (2014 TV series)|The Flash]]'', and she was hopeful to be able to crossover with [[Melissa Benoist]] on ''[[Supergirl (TV
