1960s the courses were charged with a perceived lack of interest on the part of some of its zealot followers in any music not matching the uncompromisingly modern views of Pierre Boulez\u2014the \"party subservience\" of the \"clique orthodoxy\" of a \"sect\", in the words of [[Kurt Honolka]], written in 1962 in an effort to \"make the public believe that the most advanced music of the day was no more than a fancy cooked up by a bunch of aberrant conspirators conniving at war against music proper.\" <ref name=\"Boehmer\" />{{rp|43}} This led to the use of the phrase '[[Darmstadt School]]' (coined originally in 1957 by Luigi Nono<ref name=\"Nono\" />{{rp|43}} to describe the [[Serialism|serial music]] being written at that time by himself and composers such as Boulez, Maderna, Stockhausen, Berio, and [[Henri Pousseur|Pousseur]]) as a pejorative term, implying a \"mathematical,\" rule-based music.\n\n=== Recordings ===\nThe courses presented in 70 years around 5,000 world premieres.<ref name=\"Hagedorn\" /> The lable ''col legno'' has published recordings, often documenting world premieres (''Urauff\u00fchrung'') and first performances in Germany (''Deutsche

The most common type of bark is smooth grey in young individuals, developing shallow longitudinal fissures with narrow ridges in older trees. The [[Thorn (botany)|thorn]]s are small sharp-tipped branches that arise either from other branches or from the trunk, and are typically 1\u20133&nbsp;cm long (recorded as up to {{convert|11.5|cm|abbr=on}} in one case<ref name=Phipps/>). The leaves grow spirally arranged on [[long shoot]]s, and in clusters on [[spur shoot]]s on the branches or twigs. The leaves of most species have lobed or serrated margins and are somewhat variable in shape. The fruit, sometimes known as a \"haw\", is [[Berry (botany)|berry]]-like but structurally a [[pome]] containing from one to five [[pyrena|pyrenes]] that resemble the \"stones\" of [[plum]]s, [[peach]]es, etc., which are [[drupe|drupaceous]] fruit in the same [[family (biology)|subfamily]].\n\n==Ecology==\nHawthorns provide food and shelter for many species of [[bird]]s and [[mammal]]s, and the [[flower]]s are important for many nectar-feeding [[insect]]s.

They are stuffed in the ''[[pi\u00f1ata]]s'' broken during the traditional pre-Christmas celebration known as ''[[Las Posadas]]''. They are also cooked with other fruits to prepare a Christmas punch. The mixture of ''tejocote'' paste, sugar, and chili powder produces a popular Mexican candy called ''rielitos'', which is manufactured by several brands.\n\nThe fruits of the species ''[[Crataegus pinnatifida]]'' (Chinese hawthorn) are tart, bright red, and resemble small [[Malus|crabapple]] fruits. They are used to make many kinds of Chinese snacks, including [[haw flakes]] and being coated in sugar syrup and put on a stick ''[[tanghulu]]''. The fruits, which are called \u5c71\u6942 ''sh\u0101n zh\u0101'' in Chinese, are also used to produce jams, jellies, juices, alcoholic beverages, and other drinks; these could in turn be used in other dishes (for instance, many older recipes for [[sweet and sour#Hong Kong/Cantonese|Cantonese sweet and sour sauce]] call for ''sh\u0101nzh\u0101'' jam).

The most common type of bark is smooth grey in young individuals, developing shallow longitudinal fissures with narrow ridges in older trees.  The [[Thorn (botany)|thorn]]s are small sharp-tipped branches that arise either from other branches or from the trunk, and are typically 1\u20133&nbsp;cm long (recorded as up to {{convert|11.5|cm|abbr=on}} in one case<ref name=Phipps/>). The leaves grow spirally arranged on [[long shoot]]s, and in clusters on [[spur shoot]]s on the branches or twigs. The leaves of most species have lobed or serrated margins and are somewhat variable in shape. The fruit, sometimes known as a \"haw\", is [[Berry (botany)|berry]]-like but structurally a [[pome]] containing from one to five [[pyrena|pyrenes]] that resemble the \"stones\" of [[plum]]s, [[peach]]es, etc., which are [[drupe|drupaceous]] fruit in the same [[family (biology)|subfamily]].\n\n==Ecology==\nHawthorns provide food and shelter for many species of [[bird]]s and [[mammal]]s, and the [[flower]]s are important for many nectar-feeding [[insect]]s. Hawthorns are also used as food plants by the [[larva]]e of a [[large number]] of [[Lepidoptera]]  [[List of Lepidoptera that feed on hawthorns|species]], such as the small eggar moth, ''[[Eriogaster lanestris|E. lanestris]]''. Haws are important for [[wildlife]] in winter, particularly [[thrush (bird)|thrushes]] and [[waxwing]]s; these birds eat the haws and disperse the [[seed]]s in their droppings.\n\n==Uses==\n===Culinary use===\n[[File:2013-05-23 07 24 06 Crataegus monogyna 'Crimson Cloud' blossoms in Elko, Nevada.jpg|thumb|upright|''Crataegus monogyna'' 'Crimson Cloud' in Elko, Nevada]]\n\nThe \"haws\" or fruits of the common hawthorn, ''C. monogyna'', are edible, but the flavor has been compared to over-ripe apples.

The [[Kutenai]] people of northwestern North America used red and black hawthorn fruit for food.\n\nOn [[Manitoulin Island]], [[Ontario]], some red-fruited species are called hawberries. During the pioneer days, white settlers ate these fruits during the winter as the only remaining food supply. People born on the island are now called \"[[haweater]]s\".\n\nThe fruits of ''[[Crataegus mexicana]]'' are known in [[Mexico]] as ''tejocotes'' and are eaten raw, cooked, or in jam during the winter. They are stuffed in the ''[[pi\u00f1ata]]s'' broken during the traditional pre-Christmas celebration known as ''[[Las Posadas]]''. They are also cooked with other fruits to prepare a Christmas punch. The mixture of ''tejocote'' paste, sugar, and chili powder produces a popular Mexican candy called ''rielitos'', which is manufactured by several brands.\n\nThe fruits of the species ''[[Crataegus pinnatifida]]'' (Chinese hawthorn) are tart, bright red, and resemble small [[Malus|crabapple]] fruits. They are used to make many kinds of Chinese snacks, including [[haw flakes]] and being coated in sugar syrup and put on a stick ''[[tanghulu]]''. The fruits, which are called \u5c71\u6942 ''sh\u0101n zh\u0101'' in Chinese, are also used to produce jams, jellies, juices, alcoholic beverages, and other drinks; these could in turn be used in other dishes (for instance, many older recipes for [[sweet and sour#Hong Kong/Cantonese|Cantonese sweet and sour sauce]] call for ''sh\u0101nzh\u0101'' jam). In [[South Korea]], a liquor called ''sansachun'' is made from the fruits.\n\nIn [[Iran]], the fruits of ''Crataegus'' (including ''[[Crataegus azarolus]]'' var. ''aronia'', as well as other species) are known as ''z\u00e2lz\u00e2lak'' and eaten raw as a snack, or made into a jam known by the same name.\n\nThe fruits of North America's ''Crataegus greggiana'' are made into preserves.<ref>{{cite book|last=Little|first=Elbert L.|title=The Audubon Society Field Guide to North American Trees: Eastern Region|publisher=Knopf|location=New York|year=1980|isbn=0-394-50760-6|p=473}}</ref>\n\n===Research===\nA 2008 [[Cochrane Collaboration]] [[meta-analysis]] of previous studies concluded that evidence exists of \"a significant benefit in symptom control and physiologic outcomes\" for an [[extract]] of hawthorn used as an [[Adjuvant therapy|adjuvant]] in treating [[chronic heart failure]].<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Pittler MH, Guo R, Ernst E |title=Hawthorn extract for treating chronic heart failure |journal=Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews |pages=CD005312 |date=23 January 2008 |pmid=18254076 |doi=10.1002/14651858.CD005312.pub2 |editor1-last=Guo |editor1-first=Ruoling}}</ref> A 2010 review<ref name=Tassell>{{cite journal |vauthors=Tassell M, Kingston R, Gilroy D, Lehane M, Furey A | year = 2010 | title = Hawthorn (''Crataegus'' spp.) in the treatment of cardiovascular disease | url = http://www.phcogrev.com/article.asp?issn=0973-7847;year=2010;volume=4;issue=7;spage=32;epage=41;aulast=Tassell | journal = Pharmacognosy Reviews | volume = 4 | issue = 7| pages = 32\u201341 | pmc = 3249900 }}</ref> concluded that \"Crataegus [hawthorn] preparations hold significant potential as a useful remedy in the treatment of [[cardiovascular disease]]\".

The hawthorn has been regarded as the emblem of hope, and its branches are stated to have been carried by the ancient Greeks in wedding processions, and to have been used by them to deck the altar of [[Hymenaios]]. The supposition that the tree was the source of [[Jesus]]'s crown of thorns doubtless gave rise around 1911 to the tradition among the French peasantry that it utters groans and cries on [[Good Friday]], and probably also to the old popular superstition in Great Britain and Ireland that ill luck attended the uprooting of hawthorns.

In general, a criminal sentenced to one of the many forms of this punishment could expect to be placed in a central, public, or open place so that his fellow citizens could easily witness the sentence and, occasionally, participate in it as a form of \"[[mob justice]]\".\n\nJust like painful forms of corporal punishment, it has parallels in educational and other rather private punishments (but with some audience), in school or domestic disciplinary context, and as a [[rite of passage]].

Online social platforms are very common among teenagers. Teenagers tend to stay active on social media to acquire a very attractive and appealing online profile. As young users get criticized, they become the subjects of shaming experiences and tend to develop depressive disorders. A study conducted in Vastmanland high school, Sweden provides a crystal-clear relation between public shaming and depression; the outcome of this study showed that public shaming is elevating adolescent depression. The author, Cecilia Aslund points out the disadvantages of public shaming in her remarks, \u201cExperiences of being repeatedly subjected to humiliation, ridicule, and social exclusion by other persons may result in toxic shame and stigmatization.

It could cause depression, suicidal thoughts and other severe mental problems. The humiliated individuals may develop a variety of symptoms including [[apathy]], [[paranoia]], [[anxiety]], [[PTSD]], or others. The rage and fury may arise in the persecuted individual, themselves lashing out against innocent victims, as they seek [[revenge]] or as a means of release.\n\n==Historical examples==\n[[File:Man and woman undergoing public exposure for adultery in Japan-J.

[[Josephus]] describes how the [[Roman soldier]]s would crucify people naked, and using different tortuous positions as a way to further humiliate them. Crucified bodies were left to decay on the cross for weeks, and crows would come to feed on the [[corpse]]s; this can be seen as [[post-mortem]] public humiliation. See also [[gibbeting]].\n*The punishment of public humiliation has taken many forms, ranging from an offender being forced to relate his crime, to a 'shame [[flute]]' (for untalented musicians), to the wearing of conspicuous clothing or jewelry (such as an oversized [[rosary]] ({{lang-nl|schandstenen}}, \"stones of shame\") for someone late to church). The offender could alternatively be sentenced to remain exposed in a specific exposed place, in a restraining device such as a [[yoke]] or public [[stocks]].\n* In the [[Low Countries]], the {{lang|nl|schandstoel}} (\"Chair of shame\"), the {{lang|nl|kaak}} or {{lang|nl|schandpaal}} (\"pole of shame\", a simple type of [[pillory]]), the {{lang|nl|draaikooi}} were customary for [[adultery|adulteresses]], and the {{lang|nl|schopstoel}}, a [[scaffold]]ing from which one is kicked off to land in [[mud]] and dirt.\n* In the more extreme cases, being subjected to [[verbal abuse|verbal]] and [[physical abuse]] from the crowd could have serious consequences, especially when the hands were bound, preventing self-protection.

It invariably is essential in forms of mutilation, such as [[cropping (punishment)|ear cropping]], though the functional loss is even greater; pain may even be intentionally minimized as in the case of surgical amputation, eliminating the risk of accidental death. [[Tarring and feathering]] also serves as means of extended humiliation.\n\n== Effects of modern public shaming ==\nAuthor Farah Mohammed talks about the controversy of a world-renowned YouTuber, Logan Paul in his article by stating that he was criticized very badly over the internet which brought his YouTube career to a standpoint. He posted a controversial video that included the clips of a dead person who committed suicide in the Aokigahara forest in Japan, a well-known suicide site.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://time.com/3935308/when-parents-publicly-shame-their-kids/|title=When Parents Publicly Shame Their Kids|website=Time|language=en|access-date=2020-04-16}}</ref> \n\nMany times, the same family names and wrong reporting from the news lead to confusion and people make the innocent person criminal. Relatives and friends of the victim also come in the radar of public harassment when a criminal is revealed online. In an unfortunate 2012 Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting incident, news channel wrongly identified Ryan Lanza as the shooter.<ref>{{Cite news|last=Stryker|first=Cole|url=https://www.thenation.com/article/archive/problem-public-shaming/|title=The Problem With Public Shaming|date=2013-04-24|access-date=2020-04-16|language=en-US|issn=0027-8378}}</ref> But it was Ryan\u2019s brother, Adam Lanza who opened the fire at school.

Ryan Lanza tried to tell people that he was innocent through Facebook posts and Twitter, but nobody believed him. Ryan Lanza\u2019s life changed that day and he was never able to summon up the strength to recover from that incident. Lanza\u2019s whole family was targeted and embarrassed over the social sites.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1037/e682962012-001|title=Reacting to the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting|date=2012|website=PsycEXTRA Dataset|access-date=2020-04-16}}</ref>\n\nDepression is directly proportional to public shaming; there is an upsurge of young people becoming the victims of public shaming and due to this there is a hike of depression-related diseases among them. Online social platforms are very common among teenagers. Teenagers tend to stay active on social media to acquire a very attractive and appealing online profile. As young users get criticized, they become the subjects of shaming experiences and tend to develop depressive disorders. A study conducted in Vastmanland high school, Sweden provides a crystal-clear relation between public shaming and depression; the outcome of this study showed that public shaming is elevating adolescent depression. The author, Cecilia Aslund points out the disadvantages of public shaming in her remarks, \u201cExperiences of being repeatedly subjected to humiliation, ridicule, and social exclusion by other persons may result in toxic shame and stigmatization. Toxic shame may form a basic psychological and physical pathologic reactions, presumably through chronic stress (2).\u201d<ref>{{Cite journal|last=\u00c5slund|first=Cecilia|last2=Leppert|first2=Jerzy|last3=Starrin|first3=Bengt|last4=Nilsson|first4=Kent W.|date=2009-01-05|title=Subjective Social Status and Shaming Experiences in Relation to Adolescent Depression|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1001/archpedi.163.1.55|journal=Archives of Pediatrics & Adolescent Medicine|volume=163|issue=1|pages=55|doi=10.1001/archpedi.163.1.55|issn=1072-4710}}</ref>\n== Psychological effects ==\n{{main|Humiliation#Psychological effects}}\nPublic shaming can result in negative psychological effects and devastating consequences, regardless of the punishment being justifiable or not. It could cause depression, suicidal thoughts and other severe mental problems. The humiliated individuals may develop a variety of symptoms including [[apathy]], [[paranoia]], [[anxiety]], [[PTSD]], or others. The rage and fury may arise in the persecuted individual, themselves lashing out against innocent victims, as they seek [[revenge]] or as a means of release.\n\n==Historical examples==\n[[File:Man and woman undergoing public exposure for adultery in Japan-J. M. W. Silver.jpg|thumb|Man and woman undergoing public exposure for adultery in Japan, circa 1860.]]\n[[File:Flute of Shame Torture Museum Amsterdam.jpg|thumb|left|Flute of Shame displayed at the [[torture museum|Torture Museum]] in [[Amsterdam]].]]\n\n*[[Crucifixion]] was used by the [[Ancient Rome|Romans]] to add public humiliation to a [[death penalty]]. [[Josephus]] describes how the [[Roman soldier]]s would crucify people naked, and using different tortuous positions as a way to further humiliate them. Crucified bodies were left to decay on the cross for weeks, and crows would come to feed on the [[corpse]]s; this can be seen as [[post-mortem]] public humiliation. See also [[gibbeting]].\n*The punishment of public humiliation has taken many forms, ranging from an offender being forced to relate his crime, to a 'shame [[flute]]' (for untalented musicians), to the wearing of conspicuous clothing or jewelry (such as an oversized [[rosary]] ({{lang-nl|schandstenen}}, \"stones of shame\") for someone late to church). The offender could alternatively be sentenced to remain exposed in a specific exposed place, in a restraining device such as a [[yoke]] or public [[stocks]].\n* In the [[Low Countries]], the {{lang|nl|schandstoel}} (\"Chair of shame\"), the {{lang|nl|kaak}} or {{lang|nl|schandpaal}} (\"pole of shame\", a simple type of [[pillory]]), the {{lang|nl|draaikooi}} were customary for [[adultery|adulteresses]], and the {{lang|nl|schopstoel}}, a [[scaffold]]ing from which one is kicked off to land in [[mud]] and dirt.\n* In the more extreme cases, being subjected to [[verbal abuse|verbal]] and [[physical abuse]] from the crowd could have serious consequences, especially when the hands were bound, preventing self-protection. Some sentences actually prescribed additional humiliation, such as shaving, or would combine it with painful [[Corporal punishment|corporal punishments]], see below.<ref name=\"williamsburg\">{{Cite journal |last=Cox |first=James |date=Spring 2009 |title=Bilboes, Brands, and Branks: Colonial Crimes and Punishments |url=http://www.history.org/foundation/journal/spring03/branks.cfm |journal=[[Colonial Williamsburg Journal]]}}</ref>\n* In [[Colonial America]], common forms of public humiliation were the [[stocks]] and [[pillory]], imported from [[Europe]]. Nearly every sizable town had such instruments of public humiliation, usually at the town square. In pre\u2013World War Japan, [[adulterer]]s were publicly exposed purely to shame them.\n* In Liberia, boy soldiers stripped civilian women to humiliate them; this was described with the verb phrase \"to naked someone else.\"<ref>{{Cite book |last=McBride-Ahebee |first=Octavia |title=Where My Birthmark Dances |publisher=Finishing Line Press |year=2011 |isbn=978-1-59924-827-1 |location=Georgetown, Kentucky |pages=6}}</ref>\n* In [[Thailand|Siam]], an adulteress was paraded with a [[hibiscus]] behind the ear. Thieves were tattooed on their faces. Other criminals were paraded with a device made of woven cane on the forehead, or lengths of bamboo hung around the neck. Errant Brahmans had to wear a string of oversize beads.\n\nIn [[Postcolonialism|post-Colonial times]], judicial use of public humiliation punishment has largely fallen out of favor since the practice is now considered [[cruel and unusual punishment]], which is officially outlawed by the [[United States Constitution]].<ref name=\"ziel\">{{Cite journal |last=Ziel |first=Paul |year=2005 |title=Eighteenth Century Public Humiliation Penalties in Twenty-First Century America: The 'Shameful' Return of 'Scarlet Letter' Punishments in ''U.S. v.

For example, \"Benjamin Banneker Surveys the District of Columbia\" was to \"show the presentation by Banneker and Mayor Ellicott, of the plans of the District of Columbia to the President, [and] Mr. Thomas Jefferson\" in the presence of Benjamin Franklin and Alexander Hamilton.|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161005064938/http://planning.dc.gov/sites/default/files/dc/sites/op/publication/attachments/Recorder%20of%20Deeds%20Building.pdf|archive-date=October 5, 2016|url-status=dead|df=mdy-all}}</ref>\n| birth_name  = \n| birth_date  = November 9, 1731\n| birth_place = [[Baltimore County, Maryland|Baltimore County]], [[Province of Maryland]], [[British America]]\n| death_date  = {{Death date and age|1806|10|19|1731|11|09}}\n| death_place = {{nowrap|[[Oella, Maryland|Oella]], [[Baltimore County, Maryland|Baltimore County]], Maryland, U.S.}}\n| nationality = American\n| other_names = Benjamin Bannaker\n| occupation  = almanac author, surveyor, farmer\n| known_for   = \n| mother = Mary Banneky\n| father = Robert\n}}\n'''Benjamin Banneker''' (November 9, 1731{{spaced ndash}}October 19, 1806) was a [[Free Negro|free African-American]] [[almanac]] author, [[surveying|surveyor]], [[Natural history|naturalist]], and [[farmer]]. Born in [[Baltimore County, Maryland]], to a free African-American woman and a former [[slavery|slave]], Banneker had little formal education and was largely self-taught. He is known for being part of a group led by [[Andrew Ellicott (surveyor)|Major Andrew Ellicott]] that surveyed the original borders of the [[Washington, D.C.|District of Columbia]], the federal capital district of the [[United States]].\n\nBanneker's knowledge of [[astronomy]] helped him author a commercially successful series of almanacs. He corresponded with [[Thomas Jefferson]] on the topics of [[Slavery in the United States|slavery]] and [[racial equality]], Jefferson having earlier [[Draft document|draft]]ed the [[United States Declaration of Independence]]. [[Abolitionism in the United States|Abolitionist]]s and advocates of racial equality promoted and praised Banneker's works.\n\nAlthough a fire on the day of Banneker's funeral destroyed many of his papers and belongings, one of his journals and several of his remaining [[Cultural artifact|artifacts]] are presently available for public viewing. Parks, schools, streets and other tributes have commemorated Banneker throughout the years since he lived. However, many accounts of his life exaggerate or falsely attribute his works.\n\n==Early life==\nBenjamin Banneker was born on November 9, 1731, in Baltimore County, Maryland to Mary Banneky, a free black, and Robert, a [[Freedman|freed slave]] from [[Guinea]].<ref name=Bedini2008>[http://www.encyclopedia.com/topic/Benjamin_Banneker.aspx Bedini, 2008] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160203192640/http://www.encyclopedia.com/topic/Benjamin_Banneker.aspx |date=2016-02-03}}</ref> There are two conflicting accounts of Banneker's family history.

The single notable exception is Silvio A. Bedini's ''The Life of Benjamin Banneker'' (New York, 1972), a work of painstaking research and scrupulous attention to accuracy which also benefits from the author's discovery of important and hitherto unavailable manuscript sources. However, as Bedini points out, the story of Banneker's involvement in the survey of the Federal District \"rests on extremely meager documentation\" (p. 104). This consists of a single mention by TJ, two brief statements by Banneker himself, and the newspaper allusion quoted above. In consequence, Bedini's otherwise reliable biography accepts the version of Banneker's role in this episode as presented in reminiscences of nineteenth-century authors. These recollections, deriving in large part from members of the Ellicott family, who were prompted by Quaker inclinations to justice and equality, have compounded the confusion. The nature of TJ's connection with Banneker is treated in the Editorial Note to the group of documents under 30 Aug. 1791, but because of the obscured record it is necessary here to attempt a clarification of the role of this modest, self-taught tobacco farmer in the laying out of the national capital.<br>First of all, because of unwarranted claims to the contrary, it must be pointed out that there is no evidence whatever that Banneker had anything to do with the survey of the Federal City or indeed with the final establishment of the boundaries of the Federal District. All available testimony shows that he was present only during the few weeks early in 1791 when the rough preliminary survey of the ten mile square was made; that, after this was concluded and before the final survey was begun, he returned to his farm and his astronomical studies in April, accompanying Ellicott part way on his brief journey back to Philadelphia; and that thenceforth he had no connection with the mapping of the seat of government. ...<br>In any case, Banneker's participation in the surveying of the Federal District was unquestionably brief and his role uncertain.}}</ref> An April 21, 1791, news report of the April 15 dedication ceremony for the first boundary stone (the south cornerstone) stated that it was Andrew Ellicott who \"ascertained the precise point from which the first line of the district was to proceed\".<ref>(1) {{cite news|location=Boston, Massachusetts|publisher=Benjamin Russell|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160630220952/http://www.boundarystones.org/articles/columbian_centinel_1791.pdf|archivedate=2016-06-30|url=http://www.boundarystones.org/articles/columbian_centinel_1791.pdf|title=New Federal City|work=Columbian Centennial|number=744|date=1791-05-07|accessdate=2016-10-09|quote=When Mr. Ellicott had ascertained the precise point from which the line of the district was to proceed, the Master of the Lodge and Dr. Stewart, assisted by others of their brethren placed the stone; ... |via=[http://www.boundarystones.org boundarystones.org]}}<br />(2) Bedini, 1972, pp. [https://archive.org/details/lifeofbenjaminba00silv/page/124/mode/1up 124],  [https://archive.org/details/lifeofbenjaminba00silv/page/314/mode/1up 314]</ref>  The news report did not mention Banneker's name.<ref>(1) [https://web.archive.org/web/20130322112050/http://www.boundarystones.org/articles/rchs_1969.pdf Bedini, 1969, p. 25.]<br>(2) {{cite news|location=Boston, Massachusetts|publisher=Benjamin Russell|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160630220952/http://www.boundarystones.org/articles/columbian_centinel_1791.pdf|archivedate=2016-06-30|url=http://www.boundarystones.org/articles/columbian_centinel_1791.pdf|title=New Federal City|work=Columbian Centennial|number=744|date=1791-05-07|accessdate=2016-10-09|via=[http://www.boundarystones.org boundarystones.org}}]</ref>\n\nBanneker left the boundary survey in April 1791 within three months of its initiation because of concerns about his health and the difficulties in completing the survey at age 59.<ref name=Bedini136>Bedini, 1999, pp. [https://archive.org/details/lifeofbenjaminba00bedi/page/132/mode/1up 132],  [https://archive.org/details/lifeofbenjaminba00bedi/page/136/mode/1up 136].</ref> In addition, Andrew Ellicott's younger brothers, [[Benjamin Ellicott|Benjamin]] and [[Joseph Ellicott]], who usually assisted Andrew, were able to join the survey at that time.<ref name=Bedini136/> \n\nBanneker therefore returned to his home near Ellicott's Mills.<ref name=Glawe/><ref name=Bedini136/> The Ellicotts and other members of the surveying team then laid the remaining Virginia marker stones later in 1791.

But the system that would assign to these degraded blacks an origin different from the whites, if it is not ready to be deserted by philosophers, must be relinquished as similar instances multiply; and that such must frequently happen cannot well be doubted, should no check impede the progress of humanity, which, meliorating the condition of slavery, necessarily leads to its final extinction.\u2014Let, however, the issue be what it will, I cannot but wish, on this occasion, to see the Public patronage keep pace with my black friend's merit.\"<br />(4) [https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=uiug.30112037299119;view=1up;seq=10 Banneker 1792a, p. 2.] \"Baltimore, August 20, 1791. BENJAMIN BANNEKER, a free black, is about fifty-nine years of age; he was born in Baltimore county; his father was an African, and his mother the offspring of African parents. \u2013  His father and mother having obtained their freedom, were enabled to send him to an obscure school, where he learned, when a boy, reading, writing, and arithmetic as far as double position; and to leave him, at their deaths, a few acres of land, upon which he has supported himself ever since by means of economy and constant labour, and preserved a fair reputation. To struggle incessantly against want is no ways favourable to improvement: what he had learned, however, he did not forget; for as some hours of leisure will occur in the most toilsome life, he availed himself of these, not to read and acquire knowledge from writings of genius and discovery, for of such he had none, but to digest and apply, as occasions presented, the few principles of the few rules of arithmetic he had been taught at school. This kind of mental exercise formed his chief amusement, and soon gave him a facility in calculation that was often serviceable to his neighbours, and at length attracted the attention of the Messrs. Ellicott, a family remarkable for their ingenuity and turn to the useful mechanics. It is about three years since Mr. George Ellicott lent him Mayer's Tables, Ferguson's Astronomy, Leadbeater's Lunar Tables, and some astronomic instruments, but without accompanying them with either hint or instruction, that might further his studies, or lead him to apply them to any useful result. These books and instruments, the first of the kind he had ever seen, opened a new world to Benjamin, and from thenceforward he employed his leisure in astronomical researches. He now took up the idea of the calculations for an Almanack, and actually completed an entire set for the last year, upon his original stock of arithmetic. Encouraged by this first attempt, he entered upon his calculation for 1792, which, as well as the former, he began and finished without the least information of assistance from any person, or other books than those I have mentioned; so that whatever merit is attached to his present performance, is exclusively and peculiarly his own. I have been the more careful to investigate those particulars, and to ascertain their reality, as they form an interesting fact in the History of Man; and as you may want them to gratify curiosity, I have no objection to your selecting them for your account of Benjamin.\"<br>(5) {{cite book|title=Letter from James McHenry regarding Benjamin Banneker|location=Baltimore, April 20, 1791}} ''In''  [https://books.google.com/books?id=LSkkCeq5R1AC&pg=PA114#v=onepage&q&f=false Phillips, pp. 115\u2013116] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160517183823/https://books.google.com/books?id=LSkkCeq5R1AC&pg=PA114#v=onepage&q&f=false |date=2016-05-17 }}. \"The following notice of Banneker is found, first published in his almanac for 1792, and republished with some abridgement in the one of 1793, from which we are making extracts.

On his instruction, the astronomical journal and some other loose manuscripts were removed upon his death and left to George Ellicott (1760\u20131832). The journal stayed in the hands of the Ellicott family until 1844 when it was deposited here at MdHS, where it was used by John H.B. Latrobe the following year. Quaker philanthropist and MdHS member [[Moses Sheppard]] (1771\u20131857) had the book rebound in Russian leather in 1852, and at this date most likely combined the astronomical journal with some of Banneker's loose manuscripts as well as a day book. At some unknown date the astronomical journal left MdHS and returned to the hands of the Ellicott family. It stayed there, away from the public's eye until 1987 when Ellicott family descendant Dorothea West Fitzhugh donated it in honor of her late husband Robert Tyson Fitzhugh.

Born in [[Baltimore County, Maryland]], to a free African-American woman and a former [[slavery|slave]], Banneker had little formal education and was largely self-taught. He is known for being part of a group led by [[Andrew Ellicott (surveyor)|Major Andrew Ellicott]] that surveyed the original borders of the [[Washington, D.C.|District of Columbia]], the federal capital district of the [[United States]].\n\nBanneker's knowledge of [[astronomy]] helped him author a commercially successful series of almanacs. He corresponded with [[Thomas Jefferson]] on the topics of [[Slavery in the United States|slavery]] and [[racial equality]], Jefferson having earlier [[Draft document|draft]]ed the [[United States Declaration of Independence]]. [[Abolitionism in the United States|Abolitionist]]s and advocates of racial equality promoted and praised Banneker's works.\n\nAlthough a fire on the day of Banneker's funeral destroyed many of his papers and belongings, one of his journals and several of his remaining [[Cultural artifact|artifacts]] are presently available for public viewing. Parks, schools, streets and other tributes have commemorated Banneker throughout the years since he lived.

The single notable exception is Silvio A. Bedini's ''The Life of Benjamin Banneker'' (New York, 1972), a work of painstaking research and scrupulous attention to accuracy which also benefits from the author's discovery of important and hitherto unavailable manuscript sources. However, as Bedini points out, the story of Banneker's involvement in the survey of the Federal District \"rests on extremely meager documentation\" (p. 104). This consists of a single mention by TJ, two brief statements by Banneker himself, and the newspaper allusion quoted above. In consequence, Bedini's otherwise reliable biography accepts the version of Banneker's role in this episode as presented in reminiscences of nineteenth-century authors. These recollections, deriving in large part from members of the Ellicott family, who were prompted by Quaker inclinations to justice and equality, have compounded the confusion. The nature of TJ's connection with Banneker is treated in the Editorial Note to the group of documents under 30 Aug. 1791, but because of the obscured record it is necessary here to attempt a clarification of the role of this modest, self-taught tobacco farmer in the laying out of the national capital.<br>First of all, because of unwarranted claims to the contrary, it must be pointed out that there is no evidence whatever that Banneker had anything to do with the survey of the Federal City or indeed with the final establishment of the boundaries of the Federal District. All available testimony shows that he was present only during the few weeks early in 1791 when the rough preliminary survey of the ten mile square was made; that, after this was concluded and before the final survey was begun, he returned to his farm and his astronomical studies in April, accompanying Ellicott part way on his brief journey back to Philadelphia; and that thenceforth he had no connection with the mapping of the seat of government. ...<br>In any case, Banneker's participation in the surveying of the Federal District was unquestionably brief and his role uncertain.}}</ref> An April 21, 1791, news report of the April 15 dedication ceremony for the first boundary stone (the south cornerstone) stated that it was Andrew Ellicott who \"ascertained the precise point from which the first line of the district was to proceed\".<ref>(1) {{cite news|location=Boston, Massachusetts|publisher=Benjamin Russell|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160630220952/http://www.boundarystones.org/articles/columbian_centinel_1791.pdf|archivedate=2016-06-30|url=http://www.boundarystones.org/articles/columbian_centinel_1791.pdf|title=New Federal City|work=Columbian Centennial|number=744|date=1791-05-07|accessdate=2016-10-09|quote=When Mr. Ellicott had ascertained the precise point from which the line of the district was to proceed, the Master of the Lodge and Dr. Stewart, assisted by others of their brethren placed the stone; ... |via=[http://www.boundarystones.org boundarystones.org]}}<br />(2) Bedini, 1972, pp. [https://archive.org/details/lifeofbenjaminba00silv/page/124/mode/1up 124],  [https://archive.org/details/lifeofbenjaminba00silv/page/314/mode/1up 314]</ref>  The news report did not mention Banneker's name.<ref>(1) [https://web.archive.org/web/20130322112050/http://www.boundarystones.org/articles/rchs_1969.pdf Bedini, 1969, p. 25.]<br>(2) {{cite news|location=Boston, Massachusetts|publisher=Benjamin Russell|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160630220952/http://www.boundarystones.org/articles/columbian_centinel_1791.pdf|archivedate=2016-06-30|url=http://www.boundarystones.org/articles/columbian_centinel_1791.pdf|title=New Federal City|work=Columbian Centennial|number=744|date=1791-05-07|accessdate=2016-10-09|via=[http://www.boundarystones.org boundarystones.org}}]</ref>\n\nBanneker left the boundary survey in April 1791 within three months of its initiation because of concerns about his health and the difficulties in completing the survey at age 59.<ref name=Bedini136>Bedini, 1999, pp. [https://archive.org/details/lifeofbenjaminba00bedi/page/132/mode/1up 132],  [https://archive.org/details/lifeofbenjaminba00bedi/page/136/mode/1up 136].</ref> In addition, Andrew Ellicott's younger brothers, [[Benjamin Ellicott|Benjamin]] and [[Joseph Ellicott]], who usually assisted Andrew, were able to join the survey at that time.<ref name=Bedini136/> \n\nBanneker therefore returned to his home near Ellicott's Mills.<ref name=Glawe/><ref name=Bedini136/> The Ellicotts and other members of the surveying team then laid the remaining Virginia marker stones later in 1791.

But the system that would assign to these degraded blacks an origin different from the whites, if it is not ready to be deserted by philosophers, must be relinquished as similar instances multiply; and that such must frequently happen cannot well be doubted, should no check impede the progress of humanity, which, meliorating the condition of slavery, necessarily leads to its final extinction.\u2014Let, however, the issue be what it will, I cannot but wish, on this occasion, to see the Public patronage keep pace with my black friend's merit.\"<br />(4) [https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=uiug.30112037299119;view=1up;seq=10 Banneker 1792a, p. 2.] \"Baltimore, August 20, 1791. BENJAMIN BANNEKER, a free black, is about fifty-nine years of age; he was born in Baltimore county; his father was an African, and his mother the offspring of African parents. \u2013  His father and mother having obtained their freedom, were enabled to send him to an obscure school, where he learned, when a boy, reading, writing, and arithmetic as far as double position; and to leave him, at their deaths, a few acres of land, upon which he has supported himself ever since by means of economy and constant labour, and preserved a fair reputation. To struggle incessantly against want is no ways favourable to improvement: what he had learned, however, he did not forget; for as some hours of leisure will occur in the most toilsome life, he availed himself of these, not to read and acquire knowledge from writings of genius and discovery, for of such he had none, but to digest and apply, as occasions presented, the few principles of the few rules of arithmetic he had been taught at school. This kind of mental exercise formed his chief amusement, and soon gave him a facility in calculation that was often serviceable to his neighbours, and at length attracted the attention of the Messrs. Ellicott, a family remarkable for their ingenuity and turn to the useful mechanics. It is about three years since Mr. George Ellicott lent him Mayer's Tables, Ferguson's Astronomy, Leadbeater's Lunar Tables, and some astronomic instruments, but without accompanying them with either hint or instruction, that might further his studies, or lead him to apply them to any useful result. These books and instruments, the first of the kind he had ever seen, opened a new world to Benjamin, and from thenceforward he employed his leisure in astronomical researches. He now took up the idea of the calculations for an Almanack, and actually completed an entire set for the last year, upon his original stock of arithmetic. Encouraged by this first attempt, he entered upon his calculation for 1792, which, as well as the former, he began and finished without the least information of assistance from any person, or other books than those I have mentioned; so that whatever merit is attached to his present performance, is exclusively and peculiarly his own. I have been the more careful to investigate those particulars, and to ascertain their reality, as they form an interesting fact in the History of Man; and as you may want them to gratify curiosity, I have no objection to your selecting them for your account of Benjamin.\"<br>(5) {{cite book|title=Letter from James McHenry regarding Benjamin Banneker|location=Baltimore, April 20, 1791}} ''In''  [https://books.google.com/books?id=LSkkCeq5R1AC&pg=PA114#v=onepage&q&f=false Phillips, pp. 115\u2013116] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160517183823/https://books.google.com/books?id=LSkkCeq5R1AC&pg=PA114#v=onepage&q&f=false |date=2016-05-17 }}. \"The following notice of Banneker is found, first published in his almanac for 1792, and republished with some abridgement in the one of 1793, from which we are making extracts.

On his instruction, the astronomical journal and some other loose manuscripts were removed upon his death and left to George Ellicott (1760\u20131832). The journal stayed in the hands of the Ellicott family until 1844 when it was deposited here at MdHS, where it was used by John H.B. Latrobe the following year. Quaker philanthropist and MdHS member [[Moses Sheppard]] (1771\u20131857) had the book rebound in Russian leather in 1852, and at this date most likely combined the astronomical journal with some of Banneker's loose manuscripts as well as a day book. At some unknown date the astronomical journal left MdHS and returned to the hands of the Ellicott family. It stayed there, away from the public's eye until 1987 when Ellicott family descendant Dorothea West Fitzhugh donated it in honor of her late husband Robert Tyson Fitzhugh.
