''[[An Oak Tree]]'' (1973), consisting of \"an ordinary glass of water on an equally plain shelf, accompanied by a text in which Craig-Martin asserts the supremacy of the artist's intention over the object itself ... is now widely regarded as a turning point in the development of conceptual art\".<ref>{{citation|title=Michael Craig-Martin at the Irish Museum of Modern Art|publisher=ARTINFO|date=5 October 2006|url=http://www.artinfo.com/news/story/21219/michael-craig-martin-at-the-irish-museum-of-modern-art|accessdate=23 April 2008}}</ref>\n\nIn 2015, Craig-Martin's exhibition \"Transience\" at the [[Serpentine Galleries]] brought together works from 1981 to 2015, including representations of once familiar yet obsolete technology;
