It is a common occurrence in individuals taking high doses of opioids for extended periods, but does not predict any relationship to misuse or addiction.\n\n====Physical dependence====\n[[Substance dependence|Physical dependence]] is the physiological adaptation of the body to the presence of a substance, in this case opioid medication. It is defined by the development of withdrawal symptoms when the substance is discontinued, when the dose is reduced abruptly or, specifically in the case of opioids, when an antagonist (''e.g.'', [[naloxone]]) or an agonist-antagonist (''e.g.'', [[pentazocine]]) is administered. Physical dependence is a normal and expected aspect of certain medications and does not necessarily imply that the patient is addicted.\n\nThe withdrawal symptoms for opiates may include severe [[dysphoria]], craving for another opiate dose, irritability, [[sweating]], [[nausea]], [[rhinorrea]], [[tremor]], vomiting and [[myalgia]]. Slowly reducing the intake of opioids over days and weeks can reduce or eliminate the withdrawal symptoms.<ref name=oxford/> The speed and severity of withdrawal depends on the half-life of the opioid; heroin and morphine withdrawal occur more quickly than [[methadone]] withdrawal. The acute withdrawal phase is often followed by a protracted phase of depression and insomnia that can last for months. The symptoms of opioid withdrawal can be treated with other medications, such as [[clonidine]].<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Hermann D, Klages E, Welzel H, Mann K, Croissant B | title = Low efficacy of non-opioid drugs in opioid withdrawal symptoms | journal = Addiction Biology | volume = 10 | issue = 2 | pages = 165\u20139 | date = June 2005 | pmid = 16191669 | doi = 10.1080/13556210500123514 }}</ref> Physical dependence does not predict drug misuse or true addiction, and is closely related to the same mechanism as tolerance.

Addiction includes psychological compulsion, to the extent that the sufferer persists in actions leading to dangerous or unhealthy outcomes. Opioid addiction includes [[Insufflation (medicine)|insufflation]] or injection, rather than taking opioids orally as prescribed for medical reasons.<ref name=oxford/>\n\nIn European nations such as Austria, Bulgaria, and Slovakia, slow release oral morphine formulations are used in opiate substitution therapy (OST) for patients who do not well tolerate the side effects of buprenorphine or [[methadone]]. [[buprenorphine]] can also be used together with [[naloxone]] for longer treatment of addiction. / In other European countries including the UK, this is also legally used for OST although on a varying scale of acceptance.\n\nSlow-release formulations of medications are intended to curb abuse and addiction rates while trying to still provide legitimate pain relief and ease of use to pain patients. Questions remain, however, about the efficacy and safety of these types of preparations. Further tamper resistant medications are currently under consideration with trials for market approval by the FDA.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Bannwarth B | title = Will abuse-deterrent formulations of opioid analgesics be successful in achieving their purpose? | journal = Drugs | volume = 72 | issue = 13 | pages = 1713\u201323 | date = September 2012 | pmid = 22931520 | doi = 10.2165/11635860-000000000-00000 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Schneider JP, Matthews M, Jamison RN | title = Abuse-deterrent and tamper-resistant opioid formulations: what is their role in addressing prescription opioid abuse? | journal = CNS Drugs | volume = 24 | issue = 10 | pages = 805\u201310 | date = October 2010 | pmid = 20839893 | doi = 10.2165/11584260-000000000-00000 }}</ref>\n\nThe amount of evidence available only permits making a weak conclusion, but it suggests that a physician properly managing opioid use in patients with no history of [[substance dependence]] or [[substance abuse]] can give long-term pain relief with little risk of developing addiction, abuse, or other serious side effects.<ref name=\"Long-term opioid management\"/>\n\nProblems with opioids include the following:\n\n# Some people find that opioids do not relieve all of their pain.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Xu Y, Johnson A | title = Opioid therapy pharmacogenomics for noncancer pain: efficacy, adverse events, and costs | journal = Pain Research and Treatment | volume = 2013 | pages = 943014 | year = 2013 | pmid = 24167729 | pmc = 3791560 | doi = 10.1155/2013/943014 }}</ref>\n# Some people find that opioids side effects cause problems which outweigh the therapy's benefit<ref name=\"Long-term opioid management\"/>\n# Some people build tolerance to opioids over time.

This displaces the agonist, attenuating or reversing the agonist effects. However, the [[elimination half-life]] of naloxone can be shorter than that of the opioid itself, so repeat dosing or continuous infusion may be required, or a longer acting antagonist such as [[nalmefene]] may be used. In patients taking opioids regularly it is essential that the opioid is only partially reversed to avoid a severe and distressing reaction of waking in excruciating pain. This is achieved by not giving a full dose but giving this in small doses until the respiratory rate has improved. An infusion is then started to keep the reversal at that level, while maintaining pain relief. Opioid antagonists remain the standard treatment for respiratory depression following opioid overdose, with naloxone being by far the most commonly used, although the longer acting antagonist nalmefene may be used for treating overdoses of long-acting opioids such as methadone, and diprenorphine is used for reversing the effects of extremely potent opioids used in veterinary medicine such as etorphine and carfentanil. However, since opioid antagonists also block the beneficial effects of opioid analgesics, they are generally useful only for treating overdose, with use of opioid antagonists alongside opioid analgesics to reduce side effects, requiring careful dose titration and often being poorly effective at doses low enough to allow analgesia to be maintained.\n\nNaltrexone does not appear to increase risk of serious adverse events, which confirms the safety of oral naltrexone.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Bolton|first=Monica|last2=Hodkinson|first2=Alex|last3=Boda|first3=Shivani|last4=Mould|first4=Alan|last5=Panagioti|first5=Maria|last6=Rhodes|first6=Sarah|last7=Riste|first7=Lisa|last8=van Marwijk|first8=Harm|date= 15 January 2019|title=Serious adverse events reported in placebo randomised controlled trials of oral naltrexone: a systematic review and meta-analysis|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30642329|journal=BMC medicine|volume=17|issue=1|pages=10|doi=10.1186/s12916-018-1242-0|issn=1741-7015|pmc=6332608|pmid=30642329}}</ref> Mortality or serious adverse events due to rebound toxicity in patients with naloxone were rare.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Greene|first=Jennifer Anne|last2=Deveau|first2=Brent J.|last3=Dol|first3=Justine S.|last4=Butler|first4=Michael B.|date=April 2019|title=Incidence of mortality due to rebound toxicity after 'treat and release' practices in prehospital opioid overdose care: a systematic review|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30580317|journal=Emergency medicine journal: EMJ|volume=36|issue=4|pages=219\u2013224|doi=10.1136/emermed-2018-207534|issn=1472-0213|pmid=30580317}}</ref>\n\n==Pharmacology==\n{{See also|Opioid receptor}}\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"float: right; margin-left:15px; text-align:center\"\n|+[[Opioid comparison]]\n|-\n!

There are three principal classes of opioid receptors, [[mu opioid receptor|\u03bc]], [[kappa opioid receptor|\u03ba]], [[delta opioid receptor|\u03b4]] (mu, kappa, and delta), although up to seventeen have been reported, and include the \u03b5, \u03b9, \u03bb, and \u03b6 (Epsilon, Iota, Lambda and Zeta) receptors.  Conversely, \u03c3 ([[sigma receptor|Sigma]]) receptors are no longer considered to be opioid receptors because their activation is not reversed by the opioid inverse-agonist [[naloxone]], they do not exhibit high-affinity binding for classical opioids, and they are stereoselective for [[Dextrorotation|dextro-rotatory]] [[isomers]] while the other opioid receptors are stereo-selective for [[Dextrorotation and levorotation|levo-rotatory]] isomers. In addition, there are three subtypes of [[mu opioid receptor|\u03bc]]-receptor: \u03bc<sub>1</sub> and \u03bc<sub>2</sub>, and the newly discovered \u03bc<sub>3</sub>.  Another receptor of clinical importance is the opioid-receptor-like receptor 1 (ORL1), which is involved in pain responses as well as having a major role in the development of tolerance to \u03bc-opioid agonists used as analgesics.  These are all [[G-protein coupled receptor]]s acting on [[GABA]]ergic [[neurotransmission]].\n\n[[File:Morphine structure.svg|thumb|220 px|[[Locant]]s of the morphine molecule]]\n\nThe [[pharmacodynamic]] response to an opioid depends upon the receptor to which it binds, its affinity for that receptor, and whether the opioid is an [[agonist]] or an [[receptor antagonist|antagonist]].  For example, the [[supraspinal (disambiguation)|supraspinal]] analgesic properties of the opioid agonist [[morphine]] are mediated by activation of the \u03bc<sub>1</sub> receptor; respiratory depression and [[Substance dependence|physical dependence]] by the \u03bc<sub>2</sub> receptor; and sedation and spinal analgesia by the \u03ba receptor{{Citation needed|date=March 2013}}.  Each group of opioid receptors elicits a distinct set of neurological responses, with the receptor subtypes (such as \u03bc<sub>1</sub> and \u03bc<sub>2</sub> for example) providing even more [measurably] specific responses.  Unique to each opioid is its distinct binding affinity to the various classes of opioid receptors (''e.g.'' the \u03bc, \u03ba, and \u03b4 opioid receptors are activated at different magnitudes according to the specific receptor binding affinities of the opioid). For example, the opiate alkaloid [[morphine]] exhibits high-affinity binding to the \u03bc-opioid receptor, while [[ketazocine]] exhibits high affinity to \u0138 receptors.  It is this combinatorial mechanism that allows for such a wide class of opioids and molecular designs to exist, each with its own unique effect profile. Their individual molecular structure is also responsible for their different duration of action, whereby metabolic breakdown (such as ''N''-dealkylation) is responsible for opioid metabolism.\n\n[[File:INTA.svg|thumb|220px|left|[[N-2\u2032-Indolylnaltrexamine|INTA]]: selective agonist of KOR-DOR and KOR-MOR heteromers.

This strategy strives to increase the activation of desirable signalling pathways while reducing the impact on undesirable pathways. This differential strategy has been given several names, including [[functional selectivity]] and biased agonism. The first opioid that was intentionally designed as a biased agonist and placed into [[Clinical trial|clinical evaluation]] is the drug [[oliceridine]]. It displays analgesic activity and reduced adverse effects.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = DeWire SM, Yamashita DS, Rominger DH, Liu G, Cowan CL, Graczyk TM, Chen XT, Pitis PM, Gotchev D, Yuan C, Koblish M, Lark MW, Violin JD | display-authors = 6 | title = A G protein-biased ligand at the \u03bc-opioid receptor is potently analgesic with reduced gastrointestinal and respiratory dysfunction compared with morphine | journal = The Journal of Pharmacology and Experimental Therapeutics | volume = 344 | issue = 3 | pages = 708\u201317 | date = March 2013 | pmid = 23300227 | doi = 10.1124/jpet.112.201616 }}</ref>\n\n===Opioid comparison===\n{{Main|Equianalgesic}}\n\nExtensive research has been conducted to determine equivalence ratios comparing the relative potency of opioids. Given a dose of an opioid, an [[equianalgesic]] table is used to find the equivalent dosage of another. Such tables are used in opioid rotation practices, and to describe an opioid by comparison to morphine, the reference opioid. Equianalgesic tables typically list drug half-lives, and sometimes equianalgesic doses of the same drug by means of administration, such as morphine: oral and intravenous.\n\n===Binding profiles===\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable collapsible collapsed\"\n|+ {{Nowrap|Binding profiles of opioids at opioid receptors (K<sub>i</sub>, nM)}}\n|-\n!

There are also strains which produce copious amounts of thebaine, an important raw material for making many semi-synthetic and synthetic opioids.  Of all of the more than 120 poppy species, only two produce morphine.\n\nAmongst analgesics there are a small number of agents which act on the central nervous system but not on the opioid receptor system and therefore have none of the other (narcotic) qualities of opioids although they may produce euphoria by relieving pain\u2014a euphoria that, because of the way it is produced, does not form the basis of habituation, physical dependence, or addiction.  Foremost amongst these are [[nefopam]], [[orphenadrine]], and perhaps [[phenyltoloxamine]] or some other [[antihistamines]].  [[Tricyclic antidepressant]]s have painkilling effect as well, but they're thought to do so by indirectly activating the endogenous opioid system. Paracetamol is predominantly a centrally acting analgesic (non-narcotic) which mediates its effect by action on descending serotoninergic (5-hydroxy triptaminergic) pathways, to increase 5-HT release (which inhibits release of pain mediators). It also decreases cyclo-oxygenase activity. It has recently been discovered that most or all of the therapeutic efficacy of paracetamol is due to a metabolite, [[AM404]], which enhances the release of [[serotonin]] and inhibits the uptake of [[anandamide]].{{Citation needed|date=June 2010}}\n\nOther analgesics work peripherally (''i.e.'', not on the brain or spinal cord).

Some bacteria are capable of producing some semi-synthetic opioids such as [[hydromorphone]] and [[hydrocodone]] when living in a solution containing morphine or codeine respectively.\n\nMany of the [[alkaloids]] and other derivatives of the opium poppy are not opioids or narcotics; the best example is the smooth-muscle relaxant [[papaverine]].

It is a common occurrence in individuals taking high doses of opioids for extended periods, but does not predict any relationship to misuse or addiction.\n\n====Physical dependence====\n[[Substance dependence|Physical dependence]] is the physiological adaptation of the body to the presence of a substance, in this case opioid medication. It is defined by the development of withdrawal symptoms when the substance is discontinued, when the dose is reduced abruptly or, specifically in the case of opioids, when an antagonist (''e.g.'', [[naloxone]]) or an agonist-antagonist (''e.g.'', [[pentazocine]]) is administered. Physical dependence is a normal and expected aspect of certain medications and does not necessarily imply that the patient is addicted.\n\nThe withdrawal symptoms for opiates may include severe [[dysphoria]], craving for another opiate dose, irritability, [[sweating]], [[nausea]], [[rhinorrea]], [[tremor]], vomiting and [[myalgia]]. Slowly reducing the intake of opioids over days and weeks can reduce or eliminate the withdrawal symptoms.<ref name=oxford/> The speed and severity of withdrawal depends on the half-life of the opioid; heroin and morphine withdrawal occur more quickly than [[methadone]] withdrawal.

Addiction includes psychological compulsion, to the extent that the sufferer persists in actions leading to dangerous or unhealthy outcomes. Opioid addiction includes [[Insufflation (medicine)|insufflation]] or injection, rather than taking opioids orally as prescribed for medical reasons.<ref name=oxford/>\n\nIn European nations such as Austria, Bulgaria, and Slovakia, slow release oral morphine formulations are used in opiate substitution therapy (OST) for patients who do not well tolerate the side effects of buprenorphine or [[methadone]]. [[buprenorphine]] can also be used together with [[naloxone]] for longer treatment of addiction. / In other European countries including the UK, this is also legally used for OST although on a varying scale of acceptance.\n\nSlow-release formulations of medications are intended to curb abuse and addiction rates while trying to still provide legitimate pain relief and ease of use to pain patients.

This displaces the agonist, attenuating or reversing the agonist effects. However, the [[elimination half-life]] of naloxone can be shorter than that of the opioid itself, so repeat dosing or continuous infusion may be required, or a longer acting antagonist such as [[nalmefene]] may be used. In patients taking opioids regularly it is essential that the opioid is only partially reversed to avoid a severe and distressing reaction of waking in excruciating pain. This is achieved by not giving a full dose but giving this in small doses until the respiratory rate has improved. An infusion is then started to keep the reversal at that level, while maintaining pain relief. Opioid antagonists remain the standard treatment for respiratory depression following opioid overdose, with naloxone being by far the most commonly used, although the longer acting antagonist nalmefene may be used for treating overdoses of long-acting opioids such as methadone, and diprenorphine is used for reversing the effects of extremely potent opioids used in veterinary medicine such as etorphine and carfentanil. However, since opioid antagonists also block the beneficial effects of opioid analgesics, they are generally useful only for treating overdose, with use of opioid antagonists alongside opioid analgesics to reduce side effects, requiring careful dose titration and often being poorly effective at doses low enough to allow analgesia to be maintained.\n\nNaltrexone does not appear to increase risk of serious adverse events, which confirms the safety of oral naltrexone.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Bolton|first=Monica|last2=Hodkinson|first2=Alex|last3=Boda|first3=Shivani|last4=Mould|first4=Alan|last5=Panagioti|first5=Maria|last6=Rhodes|first6=Sarah|last7=Riste|first7=Lisa|last8=van Marwijk|first8=Harm|date= 15 January 2019|title=Serious adverse events reported in placebo randomised controlled trials of oral naltrexone: a systematic review and meta-analysis|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30642329|journal=BMC medicine|volume=17|issue=1|pages=10|doi=10.1186/s12916-018-1242-0|issn=1741-7015|pmc=6332608|pmid=30642329}}</ref> Mortality or serious adverse events due to rebound toxicity in patients with naloxone were rare.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Greene|first=Jennifer Anne|last2=Deveau|first2=Brent J.|last3=Dol|first3=Justine S.|last4=Butler|first4=Michael B.|date=April 2019|title=Incidence of mortality due to rebound toxicity after 'treat and release' practices in prehospital opioid overdose care: a systematic review|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30580317|journal=Emergency medicine journal: EMJ|volume=36|issue=4|pages=219\u2013224|doi=10.1136/emermed-2018-207534|issn=1472-0213|pmid=30580317}}</ref>\n\n==Pharmacology==\n{{See also|Opioid receptor}}\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"float: right; margin-left:15px; text-align:center\"\n|+[[Opioid comparison]]\n|-\n!

There are three principal classes of opioid receptors, [[mu opioid receptor|\u03bc]], [[kappa opioid receptor|\u03ba]], [[delta opioid receptor|\u03b4]] (mu, kappa, and delta), although up to seventeen have been reported, and include the \u03b5, \u03b9, \u03bb, and \u03b6 (Epsilon, Iota, Lambda and Zeta) receptors.  Conversely, \u03c3 ([[sigma receptor|Sigma]]) receptors are no longer considered to be opioid receptors because their activation is not reversed by the opioid inverse-agonist [[naloxone]], they do not exhibit high-affinity binding for classical opioids, and they are stereoselective for [[Dextrorotation|dextro-rotatory]] [[isomers]] while the other opioid receptors are stereo-selective for [[Dextrorotation and levorotation|levo-rotatory]] isomers. In addition, there are three subtypes of [[mu opioid receptor|\u03bc]]-receptor: \u03bc<sub>1</sub> and \u03bc<sub>2</sub>, and the newly discovered \u03bc<sub>3</sub>.  Another receptor of clinical importance is the opioid-receptor-like receptor 1 (ORL1), which is involved in pain responses as well as having a major role in the development of tolerance to \u03bc-opioid agonists used as analgesics.  These are all [[G-protein coupled receptor]]s acting on [[GABA]]ergic [[neurotransmission]].\n\n[[File:Morphine structure.svg|thumb|220 px|[[Locant]]s of the morphine molecule]]\n\nThe [[pharmacodynamic]] response to an opioid depends upon the receptor to which it binds, its affinity for that receptor, and whether the opioid is an [[agonist]] or an [[receptor antagonist|antagonist]].  For example, the [[supraspinal (disambiguation)|supraspinal]] analgesic properties of the opioid agonist [[morphine]] are mediated by activation of the \u03bc<sub>1</sub> receptor; respiratory depression and [[Substance dependence|physical dependence]] by the \u03bc<sub>2</sub> receptor; and sedation and spinal analgesia by the \u03ba receptor{{Citation needed|date=March 2013}}.  Each group of opioid receptors elicits a distinct set of neurological responses, with the receptor subtypes (such as \u03bc<sub>1</sub> and \u03bc<sub>2</sub> for example) providing even more [measurably] specific responses.  Unique to each opioid is its distinct binding affinity to the various classes of opioid receptors (''e.g.'' the \u03bc, \u03ba, and \u03b4 opioid receptors are activated at different magnitudes according to the specific receptor binding affinities of the opioid). For example, the opiate alkaloid [[morphine]] exhibits high-affinity binding to the \u03bc-opioid receptor, while [[ketazocine]] exhibits high affinity to \u0138 receptors.  It is this combinatorial mechanism that allows for such a wide class of opioids and molecular designs to exist, each with its own unique effect profile. Their individual molecular structure is also responsible for their different duration of action, whereby metabolic breakdown (such as ''N''-dealkylation) is responsible for opioid metabolism.\n\n[[File:INTA.svg|thumb|220px|left|[[N-2\u2032-Indolylnaltrexamine|INTA]]: selective agonist of KOR-DOR and KOR-MOR heteromers.

Such tables are used in opioid rotation practices, and to describe an opioid by comparison to morphine, the reference opioid. Equianalgesic tables typically list drug half-lives, and sometimes equianalgesic doses of the same drug by means of administration, such as morphine: oral and intravenous.\n\n===Binding profiles===\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable collapsible collapsed\"\n|+ {{Nowrap|Binding profiles of opioids at opioid receptors (K<sub>i</sub>, nM)}}\n|-\n!

Of all of the more than 120 poppy species, only two produce morphine.\n\nAmongst analgesics there are a small number of agents which act on the central nervous system but not on the opioid receptor system and therefore have none of the other (narcotic) qualities of opioids although they may produce euphoria by relieving pain\u2014a euphoria that, because of the way it is produced, does not form the basis of habituation, physical dependence, or addiction.  Foremost amongst these are [[nefopam]], [[orphenadrine]], and perhaps [[phenyltoloxamine]] or some other [[antihistamines]].  [[Tricyclic antidepressant]]s have painkilling effect as well, but they're thought to do so by indirectly activating the endogenous opioid system. Paracetamol is predominantly a centrally acting analgesic (non-narcotic) which mediates its effect by action on descending serotoninergic (5-hydroxy triptaminergic) pathways, to increase 5-HT release (which inhibits release of pain mediators). It also decreases cyclo-oxygenase activity. It has recently been discovered that most or all of the therapeutic efficacy of paracetamol is due to a metabolite, [[AM404]], which enhances the release of [[serotonin]] and inhibits the uptake of [[anandamide]].{{Citation needed|date=June 2010}}\n\nOther analgesics work peripherally (''i.e.'', not on the brain or spinal cord). Research is starting to show that morphine and related drugs may indeed have peripheral effects as well, such as morphine gel working on burns. Recent investigations discovered opioid receptors on peripheral sensory neurons.<ref name=\"Stein C, Sch\u00e4fer M, Machelska H (2003)\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Stein C, Sch\u00e4fer M, Machelska H | title = Attacking pain at its source: new perspectives on opioids | journal = Nature Medicine | volume = 9 | issue = 8 | pages = 1003\u20138 | date = August 2003 | pmid = 12894165 | doi = 10.1038/nm908 }}</ref> A significant fraction (up to 60%) of opioid analgesia can be mediated by such peripheral opioid receptors, particularly in inflammatory conditions such as arthritis, traumatic or surgical pain.<ref name=\"Stein C, Lang LJ (2009)\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Stein C, Lang LJ | title = Peripheral mechanisms of opioid analgesia | journal = Current Opinion in Pharmacology | volume = 9 | issue = 1 | pages = 3\u20138 | date = February 2009 | pmid = 19157985 | doi = 10.1016/j.coph.2008.12.009 }}</ref> Inflammatory pain is also blunted by endogenous opioid peptides activating peripheral opioid receptors.<ref name=\"Busch-Dienstfertig M, Stein C (2010)\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Busch-Dienstfertig M, Stein C | title = Opioid receptors and opioid peptide-producing leukocytes in inflammatory pain--basic and therapeutic aspects | journal = Brain, Behavior, and Immunity | volume = 24 | issue = 5 | pages = 683\u201394 | date = July 2010 | pmid = 19879349 | doi = 10.1016/j.bbi.2009.10.013 }}</ref>\n\nIt was discovered in 1953,{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}} that humans and some animals naturally produce minute amounts of morphine, codeine, and possibly some of their simpler derivatives like heroin and [[dihydromorphine]], in addition to endogenous opioid peptides.  Some bacteria are capable of producing some semi-synthetic opioids such as [[hydromorphone]] and [[hydrocodone]] when living in a solution containing morphine or codeine respectively.\n\nMany of the [[alkaloids]] and other derivatives of the opium poppy are not opioids or narcotics; the best example is the smooth-muscle relaxant [[papaverine]]. Noscapine is a marginal case as it does have CNS effects but not necessarily similar to morphine, and it is probably in a category all its own.\n\n[[Dextromethorphan]] (the stereoisomer of [[levomethorphan]], a semi-synthetic opioid agonist) and its metabolite [[dextrorphan]] have no opioid analgesic effect at all despite their structural similarity to other opioids; instead they are potent [[NMDA|NMDA antagonists]] and [[sigma receptor|sigma 1 and 2]]-receptor agonists and are used in many [[over-the-counter drug|over-the-counter]] cough suppressants.\n\n[[Salvinorin A]] is a unique selective, powerful \u0138-opioid receptor agonist. It is not properly considered an opioid nevertheless, because:\n# chemically, it is not an alkaloid; and\n# it has no typical opioid properties: absolutely no anxiolytic or cough-suppressant effects.

He graduated from the secondary school in Kyustendil and then moved to [[Sofia]]. Since he had the talent of an artist, he moves among artists and associates with famous artists. After all, Sokolov decided to join the  Macedonian-Adrianopolitan revolutionary movement. From June to October 1899 Sokolov took part in a [[Cheta (armed group)|cheta]], led by [[Gotse Delchev]]. The Cheta managed to kidnap a rich Greek and later released him for a ransom.\n\nIn 1899, together with [[Slavi Merdjanov]], [[Pavel Shatev]] and [[Petar Mandjukov]], they dug a tunnel under the central office of the [[Ottoman Bank]] in Istanbul, where they planned to set a dynamite. The Chairman of the [[Supreme Macedonian-Adrianople Committee]], [[Boris Sarafov]], provided the money for that operation. In September 1900, the tunnel was almost completed, but due to difficulties with the supply of dynamite, the plan was temporarily abandoned. Soon, however, an Armenian revolutionary was trying to supply to the Bulgarians in the Ottoman capital explosives, but the Turkish authorities managed to arrest him. The investigation led them to the four revolutionaries who are arrested. Still, the Ottoman authorities fail to locate the tunnels and ultimately released the detainees. Merdjanov and Sokolov were deported to Bulgaria. \n\nMerdzjanov and Sokolov went to Sofia and began to think up new ideas, one of which was to hold up the [[Orient Express]] on Turkish territory near Adrianople, and to gain possession of the mail in order to finance future actions. In pursuit of this plan, they went to the Adrianople area in July 1901, with a cheta consisting of ten men, equipped with the help of Pavel Genadiev, the Supreme Macedonian Committee's representative in [[Plovdiv]]. The cheta managed to place a large quantity of dynamite on the railway line, but something went wrong, and the train passed undamaged. After this failure, they kidnapped the son of a rich Turkish landowner, but they were soon discovered and surrounded by Turkish forces. In a battle near the village of [[Matochina]], most of the terrorists were killed or seriously wounded. Sokolov was among the dead, and Merdzjanov was captured alive, together with a Bulgarian and two Armenians.

After all, Sokolov decided to join the  Macedonian-Adrianopolitan revolutionary movement. From June to October 1899 Sokolov took part in a [[cheta]], led by [[Gotse Delchev]]. The Cheta managed to kidnap a rich Greek and later released him for a ransom.\n\nIn 1899, together with [[Slavi Merdjanov]], [[Pavel Shatev]] and [[Petar Mandjukov]], they dug a tunnel under the central office of the [[Ottoman Bank]] in Istanbul, where they planned to set a dynamite. The Chairman of the [[Supreme Macedonian-Adrianople Committee]], [[Boris Sarafov]], provided the money for that operation. In September 1900, the tunnel was almost completed, but due to difficulties with the supply of dynamite, the plan was temporarily abandoned. Soon, however, an Armenian revolutionary was trying to supply to the Bulgarians in the Ottoman capital explosives, but the Turkish authorities managed to arrest him. The investigation led them to the four revolutionaries who are arrested. Still, the Ottoman authorities fail to locate the tunnels and ultimately released the detainees. Merdjanov and Sokolov were deported to Bulgaria. \n\nMerdzjanov and Sokolov went to Sofia and began to think up new ideas, one of which was to hold up the [[Orient Express]] on Turkish territory near Adrianople, and to gain possession of the mail in order to finance future actions. In pursuit of this plan, they went to the Adrianople area in July 1901, with a cheta consisting of ten men, equipped with the help of Pavel Genadiev, the Supreme Macedonian Committee's representative in [[Plovdiv]]. The cheta managed to place a large quantity of dynamite on the railway line, but something went wrong, and the train passed undamaged. After this failure, they kidnapped the son of a rich Turkish landowner, but they were soon discovered and surrounded by Turkish forces. In a battle near the village of [[Matochina]], most of the terrorists were killed or seriously wounded. Sokolov was among the dead, and Merdzjanov was captured alive, together with a Bulgarian and two Armenians. The captives were taken to Adrianople, where, in November 1901, all four were publicly hanged.\n\n==References==\n<references/>\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Sokolov, Petar}}\n[[Category:People from Kyustendil]]\n[[Category:Bulgarian revolutionaries]]\n[[Category:Members of the Internal Macedonian Revolutionary Organization]]\n[[Category:Bulgarian anarchists]]\n[[Category:Bulgarian people imprisoned abroad]]\n[[Category:Prisoners and detainees of the Ottoman Empire]]\n[[Category:1870 births]]\n[[Category:1901 deaths]]\n", "name_user": "Rodw", "label": "safe", "comment": "Disambiguating links toCheta(link changed toCheta (armed group)) usingDisamAssist.", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Petar_Sokolov"}
