To calculate the amount of sunlight reaching the ground, both the [[orbital eccentricity|eccentricity]] of Earth's [[elliptic orbit]] and the [[Extinction (astronomy)#Atmospheric extinction|attenuation]] by [[Earth's atmosphere]] have to be taken into account. The extraterrestrial solar illuminance ({{math|''E''<sub>ext</sub>}}), corrected for the elliptic orbit by using the day number of the year (dn), is given to a good approximation by<ref>{{cite journal|author=C.

The value of 0.033412 is determined knowing that the ratio between the perihelion (0.98328989&nbsp;AU) squared and the aphelion (1.01671033&nbsp;AU) squared should be approximately 0.935338.\n\nThe solar illuminance constant ({{math|''E''<sub>sc</sub>}}), is equal to 128\u00d710<sup>3</sup>&nbsp;[[lux]]. The direct normal illuminance ({{math|''E''<sub>dn</sub>}}), corrected for the attenuating effects of the atmosphere is given by:\n:<math>E_{\\rm dn}=E_{\\rm ext}\\,e^{-cm},</math>\nwhere {{mvar|c}} is the [[atmospheric extinction]] and {{mvar|m}} is the relative optical [[airmass]]. The atmospheric extinction brings the number of lux down to around 100 000 lux.\n\nThe total amount of energy received at ground level from the Sun at the zenith depends on the distance to the Sun and thus on the time of year. It is about 3.3% higher than average in January and 3.3% lower in July (see below).

A rough table comparing the amount of solar radiation received by each planet in the Solar System follows (from data in [https://web.archive.org/web/20091122194548/http://starhop.com/library/pdf/studyguide/high/SolInt-19.pdf]):\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! rowspan=2 |[[Planet]] or [[dwarf planet]]\n! colspan=2 |distance ([[Astronomical unit|AU]])\n! colspan=2 |Solar radiation (W/m\u00b2)\n|-\n|[[Perihelion]]||[[Aphelion]]\n|maximum||minimum\n|-\n| [[Mercury (planet)|Mercury]]\n|  0.3075 ||  0.4667\n| 14,446 ||  6,272\n|-\n| [[Venus]]\n|  0.7184 ||  0.7282\n|  2,647 ||  2,576\n|-\n| [[Earth]]\n|  0.9833 ||  1.017\n|  1,413 ||  1,321\n|-\n| [[Mars]]\n|  1.382 ||  1.666\n|    715 ||    492\n|-\n| [[Jupiter]]\n|  4.950 ||  5.458\n|     55.8 ||     45.9\n|-\n| [[Saturn]]\n|  9.048 || 10.12\n|     16.7 ||     13.4\n|-\n| [[Uranus]]\n| 18.38 || 20.08\n|      4.04 ||      3.39\n|-\n| [[Neptune]]\n| 29.77 || 30.44\n|      1.54 ||      1.47\n|-\n| [[Pluto]]||29.66||48.87||      1.55||      0.57\n|}\n\nThe actual brightness of sunlight that would be observed at the surface also depends on the presence and composition of an [[atmosphere]]. For example, [[Atmosphere of Venus|Venus's thick atmosphere]] reflects more than 60% of the solar light it receives. The actual illumination of the surface is about 14,000&nbsp;lux, comparable to that on Earth \"in the daytime with overcast clouds\".<ref>{{cite journal |title=The Unveiling of Venus: Hot and Stifling |journal=Science News |volume=109 |issue=25 |pages=388\u2013389 |date=1976-06-19 |quote=100 watts per square meter ... 14,000 lux ... corresponds to ... daytime with overcast clouds |jstor=3960800 |doi=10.2307/3960800}}</ref>\n\nSunlight on Mars would be more or less like daylight on Earth during a slightly overcast day, and, as can be seen in the pictures taken by the rovers, there is enough [[diffuse sky radiation]] that shadows would not seem particularly dark. Thus, it would give perceptions and \"feel\" very much like Earth daylight. The spectrum on the surface is slightly redder than that on Earth, due to scattering by reddish dust in the Martian atmosphere.\n\nFor comparison,  sunlight on Saturn is slightly brighter than Earth sunlight at the average sunset or sunrise (see [[daylight]] for comparison table). Even on Pluto, the sunlight would still be bright enough to almost match the average living room. To see sunlight as dim as full [[moonlight]] on Earth, a distance of about 500&nbsp;AU (~69&nbsp;[[light-hour]]s) is needed; only a handful of objects in the Solar System have been discovered that are known to orbit farther than such a distance, among them [[90377 Sedna]] and {{mpl|(87269) 2000 OO|67}}.\n\n== Surface illumination ==\n[[File:Sun_over_Lake_Hawea,_New_Zealand.jpg|thumb|300px|right|Sunlight shining through [[cloud]]s, giving rise to [[crepuscular rays]]]]\nThe spectrum of surface illumination depends upon solar elevation due to atmospheric effects, with the blue spectral component dominating during twilight before and after sunrise and sunset, respectively, and red dominating during sunrise and sunset. These effects are apparent in natural light [[photography]] where the principal source of illumination is sunlight as mediated by the atmosphere.\n\nWhile the color of the sky is usually determined by [[Rayleigh scattering]], an exception occurs at sunset and twilight. \"Preferential absorption of sunlight by ozone over long horizon paths gives the zenith sky its blueness when the sun is near the horizon\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://homepages.wmich.edu/%7Ekorista/atmospheric_optics.pdf|title=Atmospheric Optics|author=Craig Bohren|author-link=Craig Bohren|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131206175627/http://homepages.wmich.edu/%7Ekorista/atmospheric_optics.pdf|archive-date=2013-12-06|df=}}</ref>\n\nSee [[diffuse sky radiation]] for more details.\n\n=== Spectral composition of sunlight at Earth's surface ===\nThe Sun may be said to [[Lighting|illuminate]], which is a measure of the light within a specific sensitivity range.

Aside from effects that arise at sunset and sunrise, the spectral composition changes primarily in respect to how directly sunlight is able to illuminate. When illumination is indirect, [[Rayleigh scattering]] in the upper atmosphere will lead blue wavelengths to dominate. Water vapour in the lower atmosphere produces further scattering and ozone, dust and water particles will also absorb selective wavelengths.<ref name=\"Wyszecki_and_Stiles\">{{cite book|last1=Wyszecki|first1=G\u00fcnter|last2=Stiles|first2=W.

When the direct radiation is not blocked by clouds, it is experienced as ''sunshine''. The warming of the ground (and other objects) depends on the [[absorption (electromagnetic radiation)|absorption of the electromagnetic radiation]] in the form of [[heat]].\n\nThe amount of radiation intercepted by a planetary body varies inversely with the square of the distance between the star and the planet. Earth's [[orbit]] and [[obliquity]] change with time (over thousands of years), sometimes forming a nearly perfect circle, and at other times stretching out to an [[orbital eccentricity]] of 5% (currently 1.67%). As the orbital eccentricity changes, the average distance from the Sun (the [[semimajor axis]] does not significantly vary, and so the total [[insolation]] over a year remains almost constant due to [[Kepler's second law]],\n:<math>\\tfrac{2A}{r^2}dt = d\\theta,</math>\n\nwhere <math>A</math> is the \"areal velocity\" invariant. That is, the integration over the orbital period (also invariant) is a constant.\n\n:<math>\\int_{0}^{T} \\tfrac{2A}{r^2}dt = \\int_{0}^{2\\pi} d\\theta = \\mathrm{constant}.</math>\n\nIf we assume the solar radiation power&nbsp;{{mvar|P}} as a constant over time and the solar irradiation given by the [[inverse-square law]], we obtain also the average insolation as a constant.\n\nBut the [[seasonal]] and latitudinal distribution and intensity of solar radiation received at Earth's surface does vary.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.museum.state.il.us/exhibits/ice_ages/insolation_graph.html |title=Graph of variation of seasonal and latitudinal distribution of solar radiation |publisher=Museum.state.il.us |date=2007-08-30 |access-date=2012-02-12 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120112043906/http://www.museum.state.il.us/exhibits/ice_ages/insolation_graph.html |archive-date=2012-01-12 |df= }}</ref> The [[effect of Sun angle on climate]] results in the change in solar energy in summer and winter.  For example, at [[latitude]]s of 65&nbsp;degrees, this can vary by more than 25% as a result of Earth's orbital variation. Because changes in winter and summer tend to offset, the change in the annual average insolation at any given location is near zero, but the redistribution of energy between summer and winter does strongly affect the intensity of seasonal cycles. Such changes associated with the redistribution of solar energy are considered a likely cause for the coming and going of recent [[ice age]]s (see: [[Milankovitch cycles]]).\n\n===Solar intensity variation===\n{{Further|Solar variation}}\nSpace-based observations of solar irradiance started in 1978. These measurements show that the solar constant is not constant. It varies on many time scales, including the 11-year sunspot solar cycle.<ref name=\"acrim\"/> When going further back in time, one has to rely on irradiance reconstructions, using sunspots for the past 400&nbsp;years or cosmogenic radionuclides for going back&nbsp;10,000 years.\nSuch reconstructions have been done.<ref>{{cite journal | title = Modeling the Sun's Magnetic Field and Irradiance since 1713 | last1 = Wang | display-authors = etal   | date = 2005 | url = | journal = The Astrophysical Journal | volume = 625 | issue = 1| pages = 522\u2013538 | doi = 10.1086/429689 | bibcode=2005ApJ...625..522W}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | title = Total solar irradiance since 1996: is there a long-term variation unrelated to solar surface magnetic phenomena? | last1 = Steinhilber | display-authors = etal   | date = 2009 | url =https://www.dora.lib4ri.ch/eawag/islandora/object/eawag%3A6539/datastream/PDF/view | journal = Geophysical Research Letters | volume = 36 | issue = | page = L19704 | doi = 10.1051/0004-6361/200811446 | bibcode=2010A&A...523A..39S| doi-access = free }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | title = Evolution of the solar irradiance during the Holocene | last1 = Vieira | display-authors = etal   | date = 2011 | url = | journal = Astronomy & Astrophysics | volume = 531 | issue = | page = A6 | doi = 10.1051/0004-6361/201015843 | bibcode=2011A&A...531A...6V|arxiv = 1103.4958 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | title = 9,400 years of cosmic radiation and solar activity from ice cores and tree rings | last1 = Steinhilber | display-authors = etal   | date = 2012 | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences | volume = 109| issue = 16| pages = 5967\u20135971| doi = 10.1073/pnas.1118965109 |bibcode = 2012PNAS..109.5967S | pmid=22474348 | pmc=3341045| url = http://epic.awi.de/30297/1/PNAS-2012-Steinhilber-1118965109.pdf}}</ref> These studies show that in addition to the solar irradiance variation with the solar cycle (the (Schwabe) cycle), the solar activity varies with longer cycles, such as the proposed 88 year ([[Gleisberg cycle]]), 208 year ([[DeVries cycle]]) and 1,000 year ([[Eddy cycle]]).\n\n==Life on Earth==\nThe existence of nearly all [[Organism|life on Earth]] is fueled by light from the Sun. Most [[autotroph]]s, such as plants, use the energy of sunlight, combined with carbon dioxide and water, to produce simple sugars\u2014a process known as [[photosynthesis]]. These sugars are then used as building-blocks and in other synthetic pathways that allow the organism to grow.\n\n[[Heterotroph]]s, such as animals, use light from the Sun indirectly by consuming the products of autotrophs, either by consuming autotrophs, by consuming their products, or by consuming other heterotrophs. The sugars and other molecular components produced by the autotrophs are then broken down, releasing stored solar energy, and giving the heterotroph the energy required for survival. This process is known as [[cellular respiration]].\n\nIn [[prehistory]], humans began to further extend this process by putting plant and animal materials to other uses. They used animal skins for warmth, for example, or wooden weapons to hunt. These skills allowed humans to harvest more of the sunlight than was possible through glycolysis alone, and human population began to grow.\n\nDuring the [[Neolithic Revolution]], the domestication of plants and animals further increased human access to solar energy. Fields devoted to crops were enriched by inedible plant matter, providing sugars and [[nutrients]] for future harvests. Animals that had previously provided humans with only meat and tools once they were killed were now used for labour throughout their lives, fueled by [[grasses]] inedible to humans.\n\nThe more recent discoveries of [[coal]], [[petroleum]] and [[natural gas]] are modern extensions of this trend. These [[fossil fuel]]s are the remnants of ancient plant and animal matter, formed using energy from sunlight and then trapped within Earth for millions of years. Because the stored energy in these fossil fuels has accumulated over many millions of years, they have allowed modern humans to massively increase the production and consumption of [[primary energy]]. As the amount of fossil fuel is large but finite, this cannot continue indefinitely, and various theories exist as to what will follow this stage of human civilization (e.g., [[alternative fuels]], [[Malthusian catastrophe]], [[new urbanism]], [[peak oil]]).\n\n==Cultural aspects==\n{{Unreferenced section|date=February 2011}}\n[[File:Edouard Manet - Luncheon on the Grass - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|upright=1.35|left|[[Eduard Manet]]: ''[[Le d\u00e9jeuner sur l'herbe]]'' (1862-63)]]\nThe effect of sunlight is relevant to [[painting]], evidenced for instance in works of [[Eduard Manet]] and [[Claude Monet]] on outdoor scenes and landscapes.\n[[File:Winter Sunshine.jpg|thumb|upright=1.35|right|''T\u00e9li ver\u0151f\u00e9ny'' (\"Winter Sunshine\") by [[L\u00e1szl\u00f3 Medny\u00e1nszky]], early 20th century]]\nMany people find direct sunlight to be too [[brightness|bright]] for comfort, especially when reading from white paper upon which the sunlight is directly shining. Indeed, looking directly at the Sun can cause long-term vision damage. To compensate for the brightness of sunlight, many people wear [[sunglasses]]. [[Automobile|Cars]], many [[helmet]]s and [[cap]]s are equipped with [[visor]]s to block the Sun from direct vision when the Sun is at a low angle. Sunshine is often blocked from entering buildings through the use of [[wall]]s, [[window blind]]s, [[awning]]s, [[Window shutter|shutters]], [[curtain]]s, or nearby [[shade tree]]s. Sunshine exposure is needed biologically for the creation of [[Vitamin D]] in the skin, a vital compound needed to make strong bone and muscle in the body.\n\nIn colder countries, many people prefer sunnier days and often avoid the [[Shade (shadow)|shade]]. In hotter countries, the converse is true; during the midday hours, many people prefer to stay inside to remain cool. If they do go outside, they seek shade that may be provided by trees, [[Umbrella|parasols]], and so on.\n\nIn many world religions, such as [[Hinduism]], the Sun is considered to be a god, as it is the source of life and energy on Earth. It also formed the basis for religion in [[Ancient Egypt]].\n\n===Sunbathing===<!-- This section is linked from [[Naturism]] -->\n{{main|Sun tanning}}\n{{Unreferenced section|date=January 2015}}\nSunbathing is a popular [[leisure]] activity in which a person sits or lies in direct sunshine. People often sunbathe in comfortable places where there is ample sunlight. Some common places for sunbathing include [[beach]]es, open air [[swimming pool]]s, [[park]]s, [[garden]]s, and [[sidewalk cafe]]s. Sunbathers typically wear limited amounts of clothing or some simply go [[Nudity|nude]]. For some, an alternative to sunbathing is the use of a [[Tanning bed|sunbed]] that generates [[ultraviolet]] light and can be used indoors regardless of weather conditions. Tanning beds have been banned in a number of states in the world.\n\nFor many people with light skin, one purpose for sunbathing is to darken one's [[Human skin color|skin color]] (get a sun tan), as this is considered in some cultures to be attractive, associated with outdoor activity, [[Vacation|vacations/holidays]], and health. Some people prefer [[Naturism|naked]] sunbathing so that an \"all-over\" or \"even\" tan can be obtained, sometimes as part of a specific lifestyle.\n\nControlled [[heliotherapy]], or sunbathing, has been used as a treatment for [[psoriasis]] and other maladies.\n\nSkin tanning is achieved by an increase in the dark pigment inside skin cells called [[melanocyte]]s, and is an automatic response mechanism of the body to sufficient exposure to ultraviolet radiation from the Sun or from artificial sunlamps. Thus, the tan gradually disappears with time, when one is no longer exposed to these sources.\n\n==Effects on human health==\n{{main|Health effects of sunlight exposure}}\nThe [[ultraviolet radiation]] in sunlight has both positive and negative health effects, as it is both a principal source of [[vitamin D3|vitamin D<sub>3</sub>]] and a [[mutagen]].<ref>{{cite journal | pmid = 12174089 | volume=147 | issue=2 | title=Vitamin D and systemic cancer: is this relevant to malignant melanoma? |date=August 2002 | journal=Br.

On [[Earth]], sunlight is [[light scattering by particles|scattered]] and [[attenuation|filtered]] through [[atmosphere of Earth|Earth's atmosphere]], and is obvious as [[daylight]] when the Sun is above the [[horizon]]. When direct [[solar radiation]] is not blocked by [[cloud]]s, it is experienced as '''sunshine''', a combination of bright [[light]] and [[radiant heat]]. When [[cloud cover|blocked]] by clouds or [[diffuse reflection|reflected off other objects]], sunlight is [[diffuser (optics)|diffused]].

To calculate the amount of sunlight reaching the ground, both the [[orbital eccentricity|eccentricity]] of Earth's [[elliptic orbit]] and the [[Extinction (astronomy)#Atmospheric extinction|attenuation]] by [[Earth's atmosphere]] have to be taken into account. The extraterrestrial solar illuminance ({{math|''E''<sub>ext</sub>}}), corrected for the elliptic orbit by using the day number of the year (dn), is given to a good approximation by<ref>{{cite journal|author=C. KANDILLI|author2=K.

The value of 0.033412 is determined knowing that the ratio between the perihelion (0.98328989&nbsp;AU) squared and the aphelion (1.01671033&nbsp;AU) squared should be approximately 0.935338.\n\nThe solar illuminance constant ({{math|''E''<sub>sc</sub>}}), is equal to 128\u00d710<sup>3</sup>&nbsp;[[lux]]. The direct normal illuminance ({{math|''E''<sub>dn</sub>}}), corrected for the attenuating effects of the atmosphere is given by:\n:<math>E_{\\rm dn}=E_{\\rm ext}\\,e^{-cm},</math>\nwhere {{mvar|c}} is the [[atmospheric extinction]] and {{mvar|m}} is the relative optical [[airmass]]. The atmospheric extinction brings the number of lux down to around 100 000 lux.\n\nThe total amount of energy received at ground level from the Sun at the zenith depends on the distance to the Sun and thus on the time of year. It is about 3.3% higher than average in January and 3.3% lower in July (see below). If the extraterrestrial solar radiation is 1367 watts per square meter (the value when the Earth\u2013Sun distance is 1 [[astronomical unit]]), then the direct sunlight at Earth's surface when the Sun is at the [[zenith]] is about 1050 W/m<sup>2</sup>, but the total amount (direct and indirect from the atmosphere) hitting the ground is around 1120 W/m<sup>2</sup>.<ref name=\"Solar constant at ground level\">{{cite web|title=Introduction to Solar Radiation|url= http://www.newport.com/Introduction-to-Solar-Radiation/411919/1033/content.aspx|publisher= Newport Corporation|url-status= live|archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20131029234117/http://www.newport.com/Introduction-to-Solar-Radiation/411919/1033/content.aspx|archive-date=October 29, 2013}}</ref> In terms of energy, sunlight at Earth's surface is around 52 to 55 percent infrared (above 700 [[nanometre|nm]]), 42 to 43 percent visible (400 to 700&nbsp;nm), and 3 to 5 percent ultraviolet (below 400&nbsp;nm).<ref>Calculated from data in {{cite web|url=http://rredc.nrel.gov/solar/spectra/am1.5/ |title=Reference Solar Spectral Irradiance: Air Mass 1.5|access-date=2009-11-12|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130928011257/http://rredc.nrel.gov/solar/spectra/am1.5/ASTMG173/ASTMG173.xls|archive-date=September 28, 2013|publisher=National Renewable Energy Laboratory}} The first of each set of two figures is for total solar radiation reaching a panel aimed at the Sun (which is 42\u00b0 above the horizon), whereas the second figure of each pair is the \"direct plus circumsolar\" radiation (circumsolar meaning coming from the part of the sky within a couple degrees of the Sun).

The illumination of a horizontal surface will be considerably less than this if the Sun is not very high in the sky.

Thus, it would give perceptions and \"feel\" very much like Earth daylight. The spectrum on the surface is slightly redder than that on Earth, due to scattering by reddish dust in the Martian atmosphere.\n\nFor comparison,  sunlight on Saturn is slightly brighter than Earth sunlight at the average sunset or sunrise (see [[daylight]] for comparison table). Even on Pluto, the sunlight would still be bright enough to almost match the average living room. To see sunlight as dim as full [[moonlight]] on Earth, a distance of about 500&nbsp;AU (~69&nbsp;[[light-hour]]s) is needed; only a handful of objects in the Solar System have been discovered that are known to orbit farther than such a distance, among them [[90377 Sedna]] and {{mpl|(87269) 2000 OO|67}}.\n\n== Surface illumination ==\n[[File:Sun_over_Lake_Hawea,_New_Zealand.jpg|thumb|300px|right|Sunlight shining through [[cloud]]s, giving rise to [[crepuscular rays]]]]\nThe spectrum of surface illumination depends upon solar elevation due to atmospheric effects, with the blue spectral component dominating during twilight before and after sunrise and sunset, respectively, and red dominating during sunrise and sunset. These effects are apparent in natural light [[photography]] where the principal source of illumination is sunlight as mediated by the atmosphere.\n\nWhile the color of the sky is usually determined by [[Rayleigh scattering]], an exception occurs at sunset and twilight. \"Preferential absorption of sunlight by ozone over long horizon paths gives the zenith sky its blueness when the sun is near the horizon\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://homepages.wmich.edu/%7Ekorista/atmospheric_optics.pdf|title=Atmospheric Optics|author=Craig Bohren|author-link=Craig Bohren|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131206175627/http://homepages.wmich.edu/%7Ekorista/atmospheric_optics.pdf|archive-date=2013-12-06|df=}}</ref>\n\nSee [[diffuse sky radiation]] for more details.\n\n=== Spectral composition of sunlight at Earth's surface ===\nThe Sun may be said to [[Lighting|illuminate]], which is a measure of the light within a specific sensitivity range.

When the direct radiation is not blocked by clouds, it is experienced as ''sunshine''. The warming of the ground (and other objects) depends on the [[absorption (electromagnetic radiation)|absorption of the electromagnetic radiation]] in the form of [[heat]].\n\nThe amount of radiation intercepted by a planetary body varies inversely with the square of the distance between the star and the planet. Earth's [[orbit]] and [[obliquity]] change with time (over thousands of years), sometimes forming a nearly perfect circle, and at other times stretching out to an [[orbital eccentricity]] of 5% (currently 1.67%). As the orbital eccentricity changes, the average distance from the Sun (the [[semimajor axis]] does not significantly vary, and so the total [[insolation]] over a year remains almost constant due to [[Kepler's second law]],\n:<math>\\tfrac{2A}{r^2}dt = d\\theta,</math>\n\nwhere <math>A</math> is the \"areal velocity\" invariant. That is, the integration over the orbital period (also invariant) is a constant.\n\n:<math>\\int_{0}^{T} \\tfrac{2A}{r^2}dt = \\int_{0}^{2\\pi} d\\theta = \\mathrm{constant}.</math>\n\nIf we assume the solar radiation power&nbsp;{{mvar|P}} as a constant over time and the solar irradiation given by the [[inverse-square law]], we obtain also the average insolation as a constant.\n\nBut the [[seasonal]] and latitudinal distribution and intensity of solar radiation received at Earth's surface does vary.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.museum.state.il.us/exhibits/ice_ages/insolation_graph.html |title=Graph of variation of seasonal and latitudinal distribution of solar radiation |publisher=Museum.state.il.us |date=2007-08-30 |access-date=2012-02-12 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120112043906/http://www.museum.state.il.us/exhibits/ice_ages/insolation_graph.html |archive-date=2012-01-12 |df= }}</ref> The [[effect of Sun angle on climate]] results in the change in solar energy in summer and winter.  For example, at [[latitude]]s of 65&nbsp;degrees, this can vary by more than 25% as a result of Earth's orbital variation. Because changes in winter and summer tend to offset, the change in the annual average insolation at any given location is near zero, but the redistribution of energy between summer and winter does strongly affect the intensity of seasonal cycles. Such changes associated with the redistribution of solar energy are considered a likely cause for the coming and going of recent [[ice age]]s (see: [[Milankovitch cycles]]).\n\n===Solar intensity variation===\n{{Further|Solar variation}}\nSpace-based observations of solar irradiance started in 1978. These measurements show that the solar constant is not constant. It varies on many time scales, including the 11-year sunspot solar cycle.<ref name=\"acrim\"/> When going further back in time, one has to rely on irradiance reconstructions, using sunspots for the past 400&nbsp;years or cosmogenic radionuclides for going back&nbsp;10,000 years.\nSuch reconstructions have been done.<ref>{{cite journal | title = Modeling the Sun's Magnetic Field and Irradiance since 1713 | last1 = Wang | display-authors = etal   | date = 2005 | url = | journal = The Astrophysical Journal | volume = 625 | issue = 1| pages = 522\u2013538 | doi = 10.1086/429689 | bibcode=2005ApJ...625..522W}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | title = Total solar irradiance since 1996: is there a long-term variation unrelated to solar surface magnetic phenomena? | last1 = Steinhilber | display-authors = etal   | date = 2009 | url =https://www.dora.lib4ri.ch/eawag/islandora/object/eawag%3A6539/datastream/PDF/view | journal = Geophysical Research Letters | volume = 36 | issue = | page = L19704 | doi = 10.1051/0004-6361/200811446 | bibcode=2010A&A...523A..39S| doi-access = free }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | title = Evolution of the solar irradiance during the Holocene | last1 = Vieira | display-authors = etal   | date = 2011 | url = | journal = Astronomy & Astrophysics | volume = 531 | issue = | page = A6 | doi = 10.1051/0004-6361/201015843 | bibcode=2011A&A...531A...6V|arxiv = 1103.4958 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | title = 9,400 years of cosmic radiation and solar activity from ice cores and tree rings | last1 = Steinhilber | display-authors = etal   | date = 2012 | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences | volume = 109| issue = 16| pages = 5967\u20135971| doi = 10.1073/pnas.1118965109 |bibcode = 2012PNAS..109.5967S | pmid=22474348 | pmc=3341045| url = http://epic.awi.de/30297/1/PNAS-2012-Steinhilber-1118965109.pdf}}</ref> These studies show that in addition to the solar irradiance variation with the solar cycle (the (Schwabe) cycle), the solar activity varies with longer cycles, such as the proposed 88 year ([[Gleisberg cycle]]), 208 year ([[DeVries cycle]]) and 1,000 year ([[Eddy cycle]]).\n\n==Life on Earth==\nThe existence of nearly all [[Organism|life on Earth]] is fueled by light from the Sun. Most [[autotroph]]s, such as plants, use the energy of sunlight, combined with carbon dioxide and water, to produce simple sugars\u2014a process known as [[photosynthesis]]. These sugars are then used as building-blocks and in other synthetic pathways that allow the organism to grow.\n\n[[Heterotroph]]s, such as animals, use light from the Sun indirectly by consuming the products of autotrophs, either by consuming autotrophs, by consuming their products, or by consuming other heterotrophs. The sugars and other molecular components produced by the autotrophs are then broken down, releasing stored solar energy, and giving the heterotroph the energy required for survival. This process is known as [[cellular respiration]].\n\nIn [[prehistory]], humans began to further extend this process by putting plant and animal materials to other uses. They used animal skins for warmth, for example, or wooden weapons to hunt. These skills allowed humans to harvest more of the sunlight than was possible through glycolysis alone, and human population began to grow.\n\nDuring the [[Neolithic Revolution]], the domestication of plants and animals further increased human access to solar energy. Fields devoted to crops were enriched by inedible plant matter, providing sugars and [[nutrients]] for future harvests. Animals that had previously provided humans with only meat and tools once they were killed were now used for labour throughout their lives, fueled by [[grasses]] inedible to humans.\n\nThe more recent discoveries of [[coal]], [[petroleum]] and [[natural gas]] are modern extensions of this trend. These [[fossil fuel]]s are the remnants of ancient plant and animal matter, formed using energy from sunlight and then trapped within Earth for millions of years. Because the stored energy in these fossil fuels has accumulated over many millions of years, they have allowed modern humans to massively increase the production and consumption of [[primary energy]]. As the amount of fossil fuel is large but finite, this cannot continue indefinitely, and various theories exist as to what will follow this stage of human civilization (e.g., [[alternative fuels]], [[Malthusian catastrophe]], [[new urbanism]], [[peak oil]]).\n\n==Cultural aspects==\n{{Unreferenced section|date=February 2011}}\n[[File:Edouard Manet - Luncheon on the Grass - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|upright=1.35|left|[[Eduard Manet]]: ''[[Le d\u00e9jeuner sur l'herbe]]'' (1862-63)]]\nThe effect of sunlight is relevant to [[painting]], evidenced for instance in works of [[Eduard Manet]] and [[Claude Monet]] on outdoor scenes and landscapes.\n[[File:Winter Sunshine.jpg|thumb|upright=1.35|right|''T\u00e9li ver\u0151f\u00e9ny'' (\"Winter Sunshine\") by [[L\u00e1szl\u00f3 Medny\u00e1nszky]], early 20th century]]\nMany people find direct sunlight to be too [[brightness|bright]] for comfort, especially when reading from white paper upon which the sunlight is directly shining. Indeed, looking directly at the Sun can cause long-term vision damage. To compensate for the brightness of sunlight, many people wear [[sunglasses]]. [[Automobile|Cars]], many [[helmet]]s and [[cap]]s are equipped with [[visor]]s to block the Sun from direct vision when the Sun is at a low angle. Sunshine is often blocked from entering buildings through the use of [[wall]]s, [[window blind]]s, [[awning]]s, [[Window shutter|shutters]], [[curtain]]s, or nearby [[shade tree]]s. Sunshine exposure is needed biologically for the creation of [[Vitamin D]] in the skin, a vital compound needed to make strong bone and muscle in the body.\n\nIn colder countries, many people prefer sunnier days and often avoid the [[Shade (shadow)|shade]]. In hotter countries, the converse is true; during the midday hours, many people prefer to stay inside to remain cool. If they do go outside, they seek shade that may be provided by trees, [[Umbrella|parasols]], and so on.\n\nIn many world religions, such as [[Hinduism]], the Sun is considered to be a god, as it is the source of life and energy on Earth. It also formed the basis for religion in [[Ancient Egypt]].\n\n===Sunbathing===<!-- This section is linked from [[Naturism]] -->\n{{main|Sun tanning}}\n{{Unreferenced section|date=January 2015}}\nSunbathing is a popular [[leisure]] activity in which a person sits or lies in direct sunshine. People often sunbathe in comfortable places where there is ample sunlight. Some common places for sunbathing include [[beach]]es, open air [[swimming pool]]s, [[park]]s, [[garden]]s, and [[sidewalk cafe]]s. Sunbathers typically wear limited amounts of clothing or some simply go [[Nudity|nude]]. For some, an alternative to sunbathing is the use of a [[Tanning bed|sunbed]] that generates [[ultraviolet]] light and can be used indoors regardless of weather conditions. Tanning beds have been banned in a number of states in the world.\n\nFor many people with light skin, one purpose for sunbathing is to darken one's [[Human skin color|skin color]] (get a sun tan), as this is considered in some cultures to be attractive, associated with outdoor activity, [[Vacation|vacations/holidays]], and health. Some people prefer [[Naturism|naked]] sunbathing so that an \"all-over\" or \"even\" tan can be obtained, sometimes as part of a specific lifestyle.\n\nControlled [[heliotherapy]], or sunbathing, has been used as a treatment for [[psoriasis]] and other maladies.\n\nSkin tanning is achieved by an increase in the dark pigment inside skin cells called [[melanocyte]]s, and is an automatic response mechanism of the body to sufficient exposure to ultraviolet radiation from the Sun or from artificial sunlamps. Thus, the tan gradually disappears with time, when one is no longer exposed to these sources.\n\n==Effects on human health==\n{{main|Health effects of sunlight exposure}}\nThe [[ultraviolet radiation]] in sunlight has both positive and negative health effects, as it is both a principal source of [[vitamin D3|vitamin D<sub>3</sub>]] and a [[mutagen]].<ref>{{cite journal | pmid = 12174089 | volume=147 | issue=2 | title=Vitamin D and systemic cancer: is this relevant to malignant melanoma? |date=August 2002 | journal=Br.

The remains of an [[Iron Age]] smelter was discovered in [[Lone Hill]], a suburb of northern Sandton.\nOne of the first [[Voortrekker]] parties to settle in the area were the Esterhuysen family on the farm Zandfontein ([[Afrikaans]] and [[Dutch language|Dutch]] for ''Sandy Spring'' or ''Sand Fountain''). A monument to commemorate them may be found just off Adrienne Street in [[Sandown]] where the family cemetery is located.\nZandfontein, Driefontein (Afrikaans and Dutch for ''Three Springs/Fountains'') and Rietfontein (Afrikaans and Dutch for ''Reed Spring'' or ''Fountain of Reeds'') encumbered what was to become Sandton. The municipal [[coat of arms]] of Sandton pays homage to the three farms with three round fountain barrels on its chevron.<ref>http://www.crwflags.com/fotw/flags/za-gt-sn.html</ref>\nIn the late 19th-century the Wilhelmi family of [[Hannover]], Germany acquired the farm Driefontein No. 3 while Rietfontein was owned by the Ehler family. The original Driefontein homestead, now within the confines of the Field & Study Centre, was looted during the [[Anglo-Boer War]]. The ruins are visible on the northern bank of the Klein Jukskei River. The Wilhemi family, upon return from Germany built the 'new' 1906 Driefontein Farmhouse on what is present-day Fifteenth Street, [[Parkmore]] cum [[Riverclub]]. The farmhouse served as the icon and headquarters for the now defunct Sandton Historical Foundation and is listed as a [[City of Johannesburg]] Owned Heritage Site.\n\n=== 1960s and 1970s===\nSandton was established as a separate municipality in 1969 by the office of the Administrator of the Transvaal. It had formerly not formed part of Johannesburg but was managed, in part by the 'parent city' and [[Pretoria]] through the North Eastern Peri-Urban Land administration. Initially it was very much a residential area consisting mostly of small holdings with a rural \"horsey\" lifestyle attracting many of the upper-middle classes and Johannesburg elites. It was subsequently dubbed the \"mink and manure\" belt.{{Citation needed|date=April 2016}}\nThe [[Rivonia Trial]] derives its name from the locality of Liliesleaf Farm within the Sandton suburb where many of the Black freedom fighters such as [[Nelson Mandela]] were captured by the South African state and subsequently tried for treason. Rivonia had previously been known as Edenburg and was changed to make itself distinct from [[Edenburg, Free State]]. It was named for the surname Riven.\nSandton and its constituencies were traditionally relatively more liberal than surrounds. For example, the motion which never materialised by residents in favour for the inclusion of [[Alexandra, Gauteng]] then a demarcated black township in terms of the [[Group Areas Act]], into Sandton's jurisdiction proved troublesome for the [[National Party (South Africa)|National Party]] government which had a strong constituency in the adjacent town of [[Randburg]].{{Citation needed|date=April 2016}}\n\n=== 1980s and 1990s ===\nThe construction of [[Sandton City]] by Rapp & Maister (which was eventually taken over by the Liberty Group which still retains 75% of the complex) marked a significant change for the Sandton area. It created rapid commercialisation and industrialisation. Sandton came to symbolise the [[White flight|White Flight]] movement of Johannesburg and secured itself as Johannesburg's second [[Central Business District]].\nAfter the demise of [[Apartheid]], by 1996, Sandton initially formed part of the interim Eastern Metropolitan Substructure,<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=AeuWfbWiQfwC&pg=PA88&lpg=PA88&dq=sandton+eastern+metropolitan+substructure&source=bl&ots=z6B0YCWdM1&sig=IZ7Oe-fH-HO49EgMtLksl76t-Rc&hl=en&ei=BTwVTLqwMcWy4QaS8sT0Cw&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=5&ved=0CCcQ6AEwBA#v=onepage&q&f=false Politics in South Africa: from Mandela to Mbeki (By Tom Lodge)]</ref> and in 2000 came to be included, along with the former towns of [[Randburg]] and [[Roodepoort]], as part of the newly demarcated [[City of Johannesburg Metropolitan Municipality]] thus losing its separate municipal government and town status. Despite this, Sandton is still unofficially earmarked as a distinct region of the city and operates as a macro-suburb.\n\n== Role in 21st century Johannesburg ==\n{{further|Sandown, Gauteng|Sandhurst, Gauteng}}\n\n=== Financial and business centre ===\n[[File:Sandton.jpg|thumb|right|Sandton City Mall Johannesburg.]]\n[[Urban decay]] in downtown Johannesburg caused many corporate offices to move from the [[Johannesburg CBD|Johannesburg Central Business District]] to Sandton in the 1990s. It has become the new financial district of South Africa and Johannesburg's premier business centre. Much of the financial focus of Johannesburg has shifted from the Central Business District to Sandton. However, three of South Africa's four largest banks have kept their head offices in downtown Johannesburg, along with [[Transnet]], the transport parastatal. The other bank, [[Nedbank]], has its headquarters in Sandton. A considerable amount of the city's A-grade office space is to be found in Sandton. The [[JSE Securities Exchange]], Johannesburg's stock exchange, relocated its offices to Sandton from the central business district in the late 1990s. Sandton's gain was the central business district's loss: it resulted from urban blight of the downtown Johannesburg area. Today, the majority of Sandton's population comprises white and Asian (Indian) South Africans who are attracted by the quality of life, high-performing schools and economic opportunities available in the suburb. Sandton has also witnessed the growth of other communities of colour in recent years, further establishing Sandton's status as a cosmopolitan hub. \n\nSandton is home to the [[Sandton Convention Centre]], one of the largest convention centres on the continent and primary site of the 2002 [[World Summit on Sustainable Development]] (also known as \"Rio + 10\"), which Johannesburg hosted. The convention centre also hosted the [[African National Congress]]' victory celebrations after the party was re-elected at the 2004 election.\n\n[[Massmart]] has its head office in the Massmart House in Sandton.<ref>\"[http://www.massmart.co.za/contact.asp Contact Details] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111025213950/http://www.massmart.co.za/contact.asp |date=25 October 2011 }}.\" [[Massmart]].

[[Liliesleaf Farm]], where [[Nelson Mandela]] lived in the early 1960s and where many leading political activists were arrested in 1963 and tried as part of the now infamous [[Rivonia Trial]], is just north of Nelson Mandela Square, close to the N1 Highway, off Rivonia Road.

The remains of an [[Iron Age]] smelter was discovered in [[Lone Hill]], a suburb of northern Sandton.\nOne of the first [[Voortrekker]] parties to settle in the area were the Esterhuysen family on the farm Zandfontein ([[Afrikaans]] and [[Dutch language|Dutch]] for ''Sandy Spring'' or ''Sand Fountain''). A monument to commemorate them may be found just off Adrienne Street in [[Sandown]] where the family cemetery is located.\nZandfontein, Driefontein (Afrikaans and Dutch for ''Three Springs/Fountains'') and Rietfontein (Afrikaans and Dutch for ''Reed Spring'' or ''Fountain of Reeds'') encumbered what was to become Sandton. The municipal [[coat of arms]] of Sandton pays homage to the three farms with three round fountain barrels on its chevron.<ref>http://www.crwflags.com/fotw/flags/za-gt-sn.html</ref>\nIn the late 19th-century the Wilhelmi family of [[Hannover]], Germany acquired the farm Driefontein No. 3 while Rietfontein was owned by the Ehler family. The original Driefontein homestead, now within the confines of the Field & Study Centre, was looted during the [[Anglo-Boer War]]. The ruins are visible on the northern bank of the Klein Jukskei River. The Wilhemi family, upon return from Germany built the 'new' 1906 Driefontein Farmhouse on what is present-day Fifteenth Street, [[Parkmore]] cum [[Riverclub]]. The farmhouse served as the icon and headquarters for the now defunct Sandton Historical Foundation and is listed as a [[City of Johannesburg]] Owned Heritage Site.\n\n=== 1960s and 1970s===\nSandton was established as a separate municipality in 1969 by the office of the Administrator of the Transvaal. It had formerly not formed part of Johannesburg but was managed, in part by the 'parent city' and [[Pretoria]] through the North Eastern Peri-Urban Land administration. Initially it was very much a residential area consisting mostly of small holdings with a rural \"horsey\" lifestyle attracting many of the upper-middle classes and Johannesburg elites. It was subsequently dubbed the \"mink and manure\" belt.{{Citation needed|date=April 2016}}\nThe [[Rivonia Trial]] derives its name from the locality of Liliesleaf Farm within the Sandton suburb where many of the Black freedom fighters such as [[Nelson Mandela]] were captured by the South African state and subsequently tried for treason. Rivonia had previously been known as Edenburg and was changed to make itself distinct from [[Edenburg, Free State]]. It was named for the surname Riven.\nSandton and its constituencies were traditionally relatively more liberal than surrounds. For example, the motion which never materialised by residents in favour for the inclusion of [[Alexandra, Gauteng]] then a demarcated black township in terms of the [[Group Areas Act]], into Sandton's jurisdiction proved troublesome for the [[National Party (South Africa)|National Party]] government which had a strong constituency in the adjacent town of [[Randburg]].{{Citation needed|date=April 2016}}\n\n=== 1980s and 1990s ===\nThe construction of [[Sandton City]] by Rapp & Maister (which was eventually taken over by the Liberty Group which still retains 75% of the complex) marked a significant change for the Sandton area. It created rapid commercialisation and industrialisation. Sandton came to symbolise the [[White flight|White Flight]] movement of Johannesburg and secured itself as Johannesburg's second [[Central Business District]].\nAfter the demise of [[Apartheid]], by 1996, Sandton initially formed part of the interim Eastern Metropolitan Substructure,<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=AeuWfbWiQfwC&pg=PA88&lpg=PA88&dq=sandton+eastern+metropolitan+substructure&source=bl&ots=z6B0YCWdM1&sig=IZ7Oe-fH-HO49EgMtLksl76t-Rc&hl=en&ei=BTwVTLqwMcWy4QaS8sT0Cw&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=5&ved=0CCcQ6AEwBA#v=onepage&q&f=false Politics in South Africa: from Mandela to Mbeki (By Tom Lodge)]</ref> and in 2000 came to be included, along with the former towns of [[Randburg]] and [[Roodepoort]], as part of the newly demarcated [[City of Johannesburg Metropolitan Municipality]] thus losing its separate municipal government and town status. Despite this, Sandton is still unofficially earmarked as a distinct region of the city and operates as a macro-suburb.\n\n== Role in 21st century Johannesburg ==\n{{further|Sandown, Gauteng|Sandhurst, Gauteng}}\n\n=== Financial and business centre ===\n[[File:Sandton.jpg|thumb|right|Sandton City Mall Johannesburg.]]\n[[Urban decay]] in downtown Johannesburg caused many corporate offices to move from the [[Johannesburg CBD|Johannesburg Central Business District]] to Sandton in the 1990s. It has become the new financial district of South Africa and Johannesburg's premier business centre. Much of the financial focus of Johannesburg has shifted from the Central Business District to Sandton. However, three of South Africa's four largest banks have kept their head offices in downtown Johannesburg, along with [[Transnet]], the transport parastatal. The other bank, [[Nedbank]], has its headquarters in Sandton. A considerable amount of the city's A-grade office space is to be found in Sandton. The [[JSE Securities Exchange]], Johannesburg's stock exchange, relocated its offices to Sandton from the central business district in the late 1990s. Sandton's gain was the central business district's loss: it resulted from urban blight of the downtown Johannesburg area.\n\nSandton is home to the [[Sandton Convention Centre]], one of the largest convention centres on the continent and primary site of the 2002 [[World Summit on Sustainable Development]] (also known as \"Rio + 10\"), which Johannesburg hosted.

The [[Franco-Prussian War]] had led to the capture of Emperor [[Napoleon III]] in September 1870, the collapse of the [[Second French Empire]], and the beginning of the [[French Third Republic|Third Republic]]. Because Paris was [[Siege of Paris (1870\u201371)|under siege for four months]], the Third Republic moved its capital to [[Tours]]. A hotbed of working-class radicalism, Paris was primarily defended during this time by the often politicised and radical troops of the [[National Guard (France)|National Guard]] rather than regular Army troops. Paris surrendered to the Prussians on 28 January 1871, and in February [[Adolphe Thiers]], the new chief executive of the French national government, signed an armistice with Prussia that disarmed the Army but not the National Guard.\n\nOn 18 March, soldiers of the Commune's National Guard killed two French army generals, and the Commune refused to accept the authority of the French government.  The Commune governed Paris for two months, until it was suppressed by the regular French Army during \"''La semaine sanglante''\" (\"The Bloody Week\") beginning on 21 May 1871.<ref>Robert Tombs, ''The War Against Paris, 1871'' (1981).</ref>\n\nDebates over the policies and outcome of the Commune had significant influence on the ideas of [[Karl Marx]], who described it as an example of the \"[[dictatorship of the proletariat]]\".<ref>Rougerie, Jacques, ''Paris libre- 1871''. pp. 264\u2013270</ref>\n\n==Prelude==\nOn 2 September 1870, after France's defeat at the [[Battle of Sedan (1870)|Battle of Sedan]] in the [[Franco-Prussian War]], Emperor [[Napoleon III]] surrendered to the Prussian Chancellor [[Otto von Bismarck]]. When the news reached Paris the next day, shocked and angry crowds came out into the streets. Empress [[Eug\u00e9nie de Montijo]], the Emperor's wife and acting Regent at the time, fled the city, and the Government of the [[French Second Empire|Second Empire]] swiftly collapsed. Republican and radical deputies of the [[National Assembly (France)|National Assembly]] went to the [[H\u00f4tel de Ville, Paris|H\u00f4tel de Ville]], proclaimed the [[French Third Republic|new French Republic]], and formed a [[Government of National Defense|Government of National Defence]]. Though the Emperor and the French Army had been defeated at Sedan, the war continued. The Prussian army marched swiftly toward Paris.\n\n===Demographics===\nIn 1871 France was deeply divided between the large rural, Catholic and conservative population of the French countryside and the more republican and radical cities of Paris, Marseille, Lyon and a few others. In the first round of the [[1869 French legislative election|1869 parliamentary elections]] held under the French Empire, 4,438,000 had voted for the [[Bonapartist]] candidates supporting Napoleon III, while 3,350,000 had voted for the republican opposition. In Paris, however, the republican candidates dominated, winning 234,000 votes against 77,000 for the Bonapartists.<ref name=\"Milza, Pierre p. 65\">Milza, 2009a, p. 65</ref>\n\nOf the two million people in Paris in 1869, according to the official census, there were about 500,000 industrial workers, or fifteen per cent of all the industrial workers in France, plus another 300,000\u2013400,000 workers in other enterprises. Only about 40,000 were employed in factories and large enterprises; most were employed in small industries in textiles, furniture and construction. There were also 115,000 servants and 45,000 concierges. In addition to the native French population, there were about 100,000 immigrant workers and political refugees, the largest number being from Italy and Poland.<ref name=\"Milza, Pierre p. 65\"/>\n\nDuring the war and the [[siege of Paris (1870\u201371)|siege of Paris]], various members of the middle- and upper-classes departed the city; at the same time there was an influx of refugees from parts of France occupied by the Germans. The working class and immigrants suffered the most from the lack of industrial activity due to the war and the siege; they formed the bedrock of the Commune's popular support.<ref name=\"Milza, Pierre p. 65\"/>\n\n===Radicalisation of the Paris workers===\nThe Commune resulted in part from growing discontent among the Paris workers.<ref>Haupt/Hausen 1979, pp. 74\u201375</ref> This discontent can be traced to the first worker uprisings, the [[Canut revolts]], in Lyon and Paris in the 1830s<ref>Edwards 1971, p. 1</ref> (a ''[[canut]]'' was a Lyonnais silk worker, often working on [[Jacquard loom]]s). Many Parisians, especially workers and the lower-middle classes, supported a democratic republic. A specific demand was that Paris should be self-governing with its own elected council, something enjoyed by smaller French towns but denied to Paris by a national government wary of the capital's unruly populace. They also wanted a more \"just\" way of managing the economy, if not necessarily [[socialist]], summed up in the popular appeal for \"''la r\u00e9publique d\u00e9mocratique et sociale!''\" (\"the democratic and social republic!\").{{citation needed|date=May 2012}}\n\nSocialist movements, such as the [[First International]], had been growing in influence with hundreds of societies affiliated to it across France. In early 1867, Parisian employers of bronze-workers attempted to de-unionise their workers. This was defeated by a strike organised by the International. Later in 1867, an illegal public demonstration in Paris was answered by the legal dissolution of its executive committee and the leadership being fined. Tensions escalated: Internationalists elected a new committee and put forth a more radical programme, the authorities imprisoned their leaders, and a more revolutionary perspective was taken to the International's [[First International#The Brussels Congress, 1868|1868 Brussels Congress]]. The International had considerable influence even among unaffiliated French workers, particularly in Paris and the big towns.<ref>{{cite book|last=March|first=Thomas|title=The history of the Paris Commune of 1871|year=1896|publisher=London, S.

The German military attach\u00e9, [[Alfred von Waldersee|Waldersee]], wrote in his diary in February: \"Every night isolated barricades were thrown up, constructed for the most part out of disused conveyances, especially omnibuses, a few shots were fired at random, and scenes of disorder were taken part in by a few hundreds of persons, mostly quite young\".

Revolutionaries had gone into the streets to oppose their governments during the popular uprisings of [[July Revolution|July 1830]] and [[June Days Uprising|June 1848]], and on many other occasions.\n\nOf the radical and revolutionary groups in Paris at the time of the Commune, the most conservative were the \"radical republicans\". This group included the young doctor and future prime minister [[Georges Clemenceau]], who was a member of the National Assembly and Mayor of the 18th [[arrondissements of France|arrondissement]]. Clemenceau tried to negotiate a compromise between the Commune and the government, but neither side trusted him; he was considered extremely radical by the provincial deputies of rural France, but too moderate by the leaders of the Commune.\n\nThe most extreme revolutionaries in Paris were the followers of [[Louis Auguste Blanqui]], a charismatic professional revolutionary who had spent most of his adult life in prison.<ref>{{Cite book|title=French socialists before Marx : workers, women and the social question in France|last=Pilbeam|first=Pamela M.|date=2000|publisher=McGill-Queen's University Press|isbn=9780773583856|location=Montreal|pages=33|oclc=767669805}}</ref> He had about a thousand followers, many of them armed and organized into [[Clandestine cell system|cells]] of ten persons each. Each cell operated independently and was unaware of the members of the other groups, communicating only with their leaders by code. Blanqui had written a manual on revolution, ''[[Instructions for an Armed Uprising]]'', to give guidance to his followers. Though their numbers were small, the [[Blanquists]] provided many of the most disciplined soldiers and several of the senior leaders of the Commune.\n\n===Defenders of Paris===\nBy 20 September 1870, the German army had surrounded Paris and was camped just {{convert|2000|m|ft}} from the French front lines. The regular French Army in Paris, under [[Louis-Jules Trochu|General Trochu]]'s command, had only 50,000 professional soldiers of the line; the majority of the French first-line soldiers were prisoners of war, or trapped in [[Metz]], surrounded by Germans. The regulars were thus supported by around 5,000 firemen, 3,000 gendarmes, and 15,000 sailors.<ref name=\"Milza, Pierre pp. 143-145\">Milza, 2009b, pp. 143\u2013145</ref> The regulars were also supported by the ''Garde Mobile'', new recruits with little training or experience. 17,000 of them were Parisian, and 73,000 from the provinces. These included twenty battalions of men from [[Brittany]], who spoke little French.<ref name=\"Milza, Pierre pp. 143-145\"/>\n\nThe largest armed force in Paris was the ''Garde Nationale'', or [[National Guard (France)|National Guard]], numbering about 300,000 men. They also had very little training or experience. They were organised by neighbourhoods; those from the upper- and middle-class ''[[arrondissement]]s'' tended to support the national government, while those from the working-class neighbourhoods were far more radical and politicised. Guardsmen from many units were known for their lack of discipline; some units refused to wear uniforms, often refused to obey orders without discussing them, and demanded the right to elect their own officers. The members of the National Guard from working-class neighbourhoods became the main armed force of the Commune.<ref name=\"Milza, Pierre pp. 143-145\"/>\n\n===Siege of Paris; first demonstrations===\n[[File:Varlin-eugene.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Eug\u00e8ne Varlin]] led several thousand National Guard soldiers to march to the Hotel de Ville chanting \"Long Live the Commune!\"]]\n\nAs the Germans surrounded the city, radical groups saw that the Government of National Defence had few soldiers to defend itself, and launched the first demonstrations against it. On 19 September, National Guard units from the main working-class neighbourhoods\u2014Belleville, Menilmontant, La Villette, Montrouge, the [[Faubourg Saint-Antoine]], and the Faubourg du Temple\u2014marched to the centre of the city and demanded that a new government, a Commune, be elected. They were met by regular army units loyal to the Government of National Defence, and the demonstrators eventually dispersed peacefully. On 5 October, 5,000 protesters marched from Belleville to the Hotel de Ville, demanding immediate municipal elections and rifles. On 8 October, several thousand soldiers from the National Guard, led by [[Eug\u00e8ne Varlin]] of the First International, marched to the centre chanting 'Long Live the Commune!\", but they also dispersed without incident.\n\nLater in October, General [[Louis Jules Trochu]] launched a series of armed attacks to break the German siege, with heavy losses and no success. The telegraph line connecting Paris with the rest of France had been cut by the Germans on 27 September. On 6 October, Defense Minister [[L\u00e9on Gambetta]] departed the city by balloon to try to organise national resistance against the Germans.<ref>Milza, 2009b, pp. 143\u2013165</ref>\n\n===Uprising of 31 October===\n[[File:Le 31 octobre 1870.jpg|thumb|upright|Revolutionary units of the National Guard briefly seized the Hotel de Ville on 31 October 1870, but the uprising failed.]]\n\nOn 28 October, the news arrived in Paris that the 160,000 soldiers of the French army at Metz, which had been surrounded by the Germans since August, had surrendered. The news arrived the same day of the failure of another attempt by the French army to break the siege of Paris at Bourget, with heavy losses. On 31 October, the leaders of the main revolutionary groups in Paris, including Blanqui, [[F\u00e9lix Pyat]] and [[Louis Charles Delescluze]], called new demonstrations at the Hotel de Ville against General Trochu and the government. Fifteen thousand demonstrators, some of them armed, gathered in front of the H\u00f4tel de Ville in pouring rain, calling for the resignation of Trochu and the proclamation of a commune. Shots were fired from the H\u00f4tel de Ville, one narrowly missing Trochu, and the demonstrators crowded into the building, demanding the creation of a new government, and making lists of its proposed members.<ref name=\"Milza, 2009b, pp. 206\u2013213\">Milza, 2009b, pp. 206\u2013213</ref>\n\nBlanqui, the leader of the most radical faction, established his own headquarters at the nearby [[Prefectures in France|Prefecture]] of the Seine, issuing orders and decrees to his followers, intent upon establishing his own government. While the formation of the new government was taking place inside the H\u00f4tel de Ville, however, units of the National Guard and ''Garde Mobile'' loyal to General Trochu arrived and recaptured the building without violence. By three o'clock, the demonstrators had been given safe passage and left, and the brief uprising was over.<ref name=\"Milza, 2009b, pp. 206\u2013213\"/>\n\nOn 3 November, city authorities organized a plebiscite of Parisian voters, asking if they had confidence in the Government of National Defence. \"Yes\" votes totalled 557,996, while 62,638 voted \"no\". Two days later, municipal councils in each of the twenty ''arrondissements'' of Paris voted to elect mayors; five councils elected radical opposition candidates, including Delescluze and a young Montmartrean doctor, [[Georges Clemenceau]].<ref>Milza, 2009b, pp. 212\u2013213</ref>\n\n===Negotiations with the Germans; continued war===\nIn September and October [[Adolphe Thiers]], the leader of the National Assembly conservatives, had toured Europe, consulting with the foreign ministers of Britain, Russia, and Austria, and found that none of them were willing to support France against the Germans. He reported to the Government that there was no alternative to negotiating an armistice. He travelled to German-occupied [[Tours]] and met with Bismarck on 1 November. The Chancellor demanded the cession of all of Alsace, parts of Lorraine, and enormous reparations. The Government of National Defence decided to continue the war and raise a new army to fight the Germans. The newly organized French armies won a single victory at [[Battle of Coulmiers|Coulmiers]] on 10 November, but an attempt by General [[Auguste-Alexandre Ducrot]] on 29 November at [[Battle of Villiers|Villiers]] to break out of Paris was defeated with a loss of 4,000 soldiers, compared with 1,700 German casualties.\n\nEveryday life for Parisians became increasingly difficult during the siege. In December temperatures dropped to {{convert|-15|C|F}}, and the [[Seine]] froze for three weeks. Parisians suffered shortages of food, firewood, coal and medicine. The city was almost completely dark at night. The only communication with the outside world was by balloon, carrier pigeon, or letters packed in iron balls floated down the Seine. Rumours and conspiracy theories abounded. Because supplies of ordinary food ran out, starving denizens ate most of the city zoo's animals, and then having eaten those, Parisians resorted to feeding on rats.\n\nBy early January 1871, Bismarck and the Germans themselves were tired of the prolonged siege. They installed seventy-two 120- and 150-mm artillery pieces in the forts around Paris and on 5 January began to bombard the city day and night. Between 300 and 600 shells hit the centre of the city every day.<ref>Milza, 2009b, pp. 257\u2013259</ref>\n\n===Uprising and armistice===\n{{Main|Armistice of Versailles}}\n\nBetween 11 and 19 January 1871, the French armies had been defeated on four fronts and Paris was facing a famine. General Trochu received reports from the prefect of Paris that agitation against the government and military leaders was increasing in the political clubs and in the National Guard of the working-class neighbourhoods of Belleville, La Chapelle, [[Montmartre]], and Gros-Caillou.{{Sfn|Milza|2009a|pages=420\u2013425}}\n\nAt midday on 22 January, three or four hundred National Guards and members of radical groups\u2014mostly Blanquists\u2014gathered outside the H\u00f4tel de Ville. A battalion of ''Gardes Mobiles'' from Brittany was inside the building to defend it in case of an assault. The demonstrators presented their demands that the military be placed under civil control, and that there be an immediate election of a commune. The atmosphere was tense, and in the middle of the afternoon, gunfire broke out between the two sides; each side blamed the other for firing first. Six demonstrators were killed, and the army cleared the square. The government quickly banned two publications, ''Le Reveil'' of Delescluze and ''Le Combat'' of Pyat, and arrested 83 revolutionaries. {{Sfn|Rougerie|2014|page=39}}\n\nAt the same time as the demonstration in Paris, the leaders of the Government of National Defence in Bordeaux had concluded that the war could not continue. On 26 January, they signed a ceasefire and armistice, with special conditions for Paris. The city would not be occupied by the Germans. Regular soldiers would give up their arms, but would not be taken into captivity. Paris would pay an indemnity of 200 million francs. At [[Jules Favre]]'s request, Bismarck agreed not to disarm the National Guard, so that order could be maintained in the city.{{sfn|Rougerie|2014|pages=40\u201341}}\n\n===Adolphe Thiers; parliamentary elections of 1871===\n{{See also|French legislative election, February 1871}}\n[[File:Adolphe Thiers Nadar 2.JPG|thumb|upright|[[Adolphe Thiers]], the chief executive of the French Government during the Commune]]\n\nThe national government in Bordeaux called for national elections at the end of January, held just ten days later on 8 February. Most electors in France were rural, Catholic and conservative, and this was reflected in the results; of the 645 deputies assembled in Bordeaux on February, about 400 favoured a constitutional monarchy under either [[Henri, Count of Chambord]] (grandson of [[Charles X of France|Charles X]]) or [[Prince Philippe, Count of Paris]] (grandson of [[Louis Philippe]]).<ref>Milza, 2009b, pp. 420\u2013421</ref>\n\nOf the 200 republicans in the new parliament, 80 were former [[Orl\u00e9anists]] (Philippe's supporters) and moderately conservative. They were led by Adolphe Thiers, who was elected in 26 departments, the most of any candidate. There were an equal number of more radical republicans, including Jules Favre and [[Jules Ferry]], who wanted a republic without a monarch, and who felt that signing the peace treaty was unavoidable. Finally, on the extreme left, there were the radical republicans and socialists, a group that included [[Louis Blanc]], L\u00e9on Gambetta and Georges Clemenceau. This group was dominant in Paris, where they won 37 of the 42 seats.<ref>Milza, 2009b, p. 421</ref>\n\nOn 17 February the new Parliament elected the 74-year-old Thiers as chief executive of the French Third Republic. He was considered to be the candidate most likely to bring peace and to restore order. Long an opponent of the Prussian war, Thiers persuaded Parliament that peace was necessary. He travelled to Versailles, where Bismarck and the German Emperor were waiting, and on 24 February the armistice was signed.\n\n==Establishment==\n\n===Dispute over cannons of Paris===\n[[File:communecannon.jpg|thumb|A contemporary sketch of women and children helping take two National Guard cannons to Montmartre]]\n\nAt the end of the war 400 obsolete muzzle-loading bronze cannons, partly paid for by the Paris public via a subscription, remained in the city. The new Central Committee of the National Guard, now dominated by radicals, decided to put the cannons in parks in the working-class neighborhoods of [[Belleville (Paris M\u00e9tro)|Belleville]], Buttes-Chaumont and Montmartre, to keep them away from the regular army and to defend the city against any attack by the national government. Thiers was equally determined to bring the cannons under national-government control.\n\nClemenceau, a friend of several revolutionaries, tried to negotiate a compromise; some cannons would remain in Paris and the rest go to the army. However, Thiers and the National Assembly did not accept his proposals. The chief executive wanted to restore order and national authority in Paris as quickly as possible, and the cannons became a symbol of that authority. The Assembly also refused to prolong the moratorium on debt collections imposed during the war; and suspended two radical newspapers, ''[[Jules Vall\u00e8s#Le Cri du Peuple|Le Cri du Peuple]]'' of [[Jules Valles]] and ''Le Mot d'Ordre'' of [[Victor Henri Rochefort, Marquis de Rochefort-Lu\u00e7ay|Henri Rochefort]], which further inflamed Parisian radical opinion. Thiers also decided to move the National Assembly and government from Bordeaux to Versailles, rather than to Paris, to be farther away from the pressure of demonstrations, which further enraged the National Guard and the radical political clubs.<ref>Milza, 2009a, pp. 8\u20139</ref>\n\nOn 17 March 1871, there was a meeting of Thiers and his cabinet, who were joined by Paris mayor [[Jules Ferry]], National Guard commander General [[Louis d'Aurelle de Paladines|D'Aurelle de Paladines]] and General [[Joseph Vinoy]], commander of the regular army units in Paris. Thiers announced a plan to send the army the next day to take charge of the cannons. The plan was initially opposed by War Minister [[Adolphe Le Fl\u00f4]], D'Aurelle de Paladines, and Vinoy, who argued that the move was premature, because the army had too few soldiers, was undisciplined and demoralized, and that many units had become politicized and were unreliable. Vinoy urged that they wait until Germany had released the French prisoners of war, and the army returned to full strength. Thiers insisted that the planned operation must go ahead as quickly as possible, to have the element of surprise. If the seizure of the cannon was not successful, the government would withdraw from the centre of Paris, build up its forces, and then attack with overwhelming force, as they had done during the uprising of June 1848. The Council accepted his decision, and Vinoy gave orders for the operation to begin the next day.<ref>Milza, 2009a, pp. 9\u201311</ref>\n\n===Failed seizure attempt and government retreat===\n[[File:Jacques L\u00e9on Cl\u00e9ment-Thomas (1809-1871).jpg|thumb|upright|The killing of Generals Cl\u00e9ment-Thomas (above) and Lecomte by national guardsmen on 18 March sparked the armed conflict between the French Army and the National Guard.]]\n\nEarly in the morning of 18 March, two brigades of soldiers climbed the butte of [[Montmartre]], where the largest collection of cannons, 170 in number, were located. A small group of revolutionary national guardsmen were already there, and there was a brief confrontation between the brigade led by General [[Claude Lecomte]], and the National Guard; one guardsman, named Turpin, was shot dead. Word of the shooting spread quickly, and members of the National Guard from all over the neighbourhood, including Clemenceau, hurried to the site to confront the soldiers.\n\nWhile the Army had succeeded in securing the cannons at [[Belleville, Paris|Belleville]] and [[Parc des Buttes-Chaumont|Buttes-Chaumont]] and other strategic points, at Montmartre a crowd gathered and continued to grow, and the situation grew increasingly tense. The horses that were needed to move the cannon away did not arrive, and the army units were immobilized. As the soldiers were surrounded, they began to break ranks and join the crowd. General Lecomte tried to withdraw, and then ordered his soldiers to load their weapons and fix bayonets. He thrice ordered them to fire, but the soldiers refused. Some of the officers were disarmed and taken to the city hall of Montmartre, under the protection of Clemenceau. General Lecomte and the officers of his staff were seized by the guardsmen and his mutinous soldiers and taken to the local headquarters of the National Guard at the ballroom of the [[Ch\u00e2teau Rouge (Paris M\u00e9tro)|Chateau-Rouge]]. The officers were pelted with rocks, struck, threatened, and insulted by the crowd. In the middle of the afternoon Lecomte and the other officers were taken to 6 Rue des Rosiers by members of a group calling themselves The Committee of Vigilance of the 18th ''arrondissement'', who demanded that they be tried and executed.<ref>Milza, 2009a, pp. 16\u201318</ref>\n\nAt 5:00 in the afternoon, the National Guard had captured another important prisoner: General [[Jacques Leon Cl\u00e9ment-Thomas]]. An ardent republican and fierce disciplinarian, he had helped suppress the armed uprising of June 1848 against the Second Republic. Because of his republican beliefs, he had been arrested by Napoleon III and exiled, and had only returned to France after the downfall of the Empire. He was particularly hated by the national guardsmen of Montmartre and Belleville because of the severe discipline he imposed during the siege of Paris.<ref>Milza, 2009a, pp. 18\u201319</ref> Earlier that day, dressed in civilian clothes, he had been trying to find out what was going on, when he was recognized by a soldier and arrested, and brought to the building at Rue des Rosiers. At about 5:30 on 18 March, the angry crowd of national guardsmen and deserters from Lecomte's regiment at Rue des Rosiers seized Cl\u00e9ment-Thomas, beat him with rifle butts, pushed him into the garden, and shot him repeatedly. A few minutes later, they did the same to General Lecomte. Doctor Guyon, who examined the bodies shortly afterwards, found forty balls in the body of Cl\u00e9ment-Thomas and nine balls in the back of Lecomte.<ref>Milza, 2009a, p. 19</ref>{{sfn|Gluckstein|2006|page=231}} By late morning, the operation to recapture the cannons had failed, and crowds and barricades were appearing in all the working-class neighborhoods of Paris. General Vinoy ordered the army to pull back to the Seine, and Thiers began to organise a withdrawal to Versailles, where he could gather enough troops to take back Paris.\n\nOn the afternoon of 18 March, following the government's failed attempt to seize the cannons at Montmartre, the Central Committee of the National Guard ordered the three battalions to seize the H\u00f4tel de Ville, where they believed the government was located. They were not aware that Thiers, the government, and the military commanders were at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, where the gates were open and there were few guards. They were also unaware that Marshal [[Patrice MacMahon]], the future commander of the forces against the Commune, had just arrived at his home in Paris, having just been released from imprisonment in Germany. As soon as he heard the news of the uprising, he made his way to the railway station, where national guardsmen were already stopping and checking the identity of departing passengers. A sympathetic station manager hid him in his office and helped him board a train, and he escaped the city. While he was at the railway station, national guardsmen sent by the Central Committee arrived at his house looking for him.<ref>Milza, 2009a, p. 76</ref>{{sfn|Gluckstein|2006|page=4}}\n\nOn the advice of General Vinoy, Thiers ordered the evacuation to Versailles of all the regular forces in Paris, some 40,000 soldiers, including those in the fortresses around the city; the regrouping of all the army units in Versailles; and the departure of all government ministries from the city.\n\n===National Guard takes power===\n[[File:Barricades pres de Ministere de la Marine et l'H\u00f6tel Crillon.jpg|thumb|Barricades during the Paris Commune, near the [[Place de la Concorde]]]]\n\nIn February, while the national government had been organising in Bordeaux, a new rival government had been organised in Paris. The National Guard had not been disarmed as per the armistice, and had on paper 260 battalions of 1,500 men each, a total of 390,000 men.<ref>Milza, 2009a, p. 35</ref> Between 15 and 24 February, some 500 delegates elected by the National Guard began meeting in Paris. On 15 March, just before the confrontation between the National Guard and the regular army over the cannons, 1,325 delegates of the federation of organisations created by the National Guard elected a leader, [[Giuseppe Garibaldi]] (who was in Italy and respectfully declined the title), and created a Central Committee of 38 members, which made its headquarters in a school on the [[Rue Basfroi]], between [[Place de la Bastille]] and [[La Roquette]]. The first vote of the new Central Committee was to refuse to recognise the authority of General D'Aurelle de Paladines, the official commander of the National Guard appointed by Thiers, or of General Vinoy, the Military Governor of Paris.<ref>Milza, 2009a, p. 45</ref>\n\nLate on 18 March, when they learned that the regular army was leaving Paris, units of the National Guard moved quickly to take control of the city. The first to take action were the followers of Blanqui, who went quickly to the [[Latin Quarter]] and took charge of the gunpowder stored in the [[Pantheon (Paris)|Pantheon]], and to the Orleans railway station. Four battalions crossed the Seine and captured the [[Paris Police Prefecture|prefecture of police]], while other units occupied the former headquarters of the National Guard at the [[Place Vend\u00f4me]], as well as the Ministry of Justice. That night, the National Guard occupied the offices vacated by the government; they quickly took over the Ministries of Finance, the Interior, and War. At eight in the morning the next day, the Central Committee was meeting in the H\u00f4tel de Ville. By the end of the day, 20,000 national guardsmen camped in triumph in the square in front of the H\u00f4tel de Ville, with several dozen cannons. A red flag was hoisted over the building.<ref>Milza, 2009a, p. 77</ref>\n\nThe extreme-left members of the Central Committee, led by the Blanquists, demanded an immediate march on Versailles to disperse the Thiers government and to impose their authority on all of France; but the majority first wanted to establish a more solid base of legal authority in Paris. The Committee officially lifted the state of siege, named commissions to administer the government, and called elections for 23 March. They also sent a delegation of mayors of the Paris ''arrondissements'', led by Clemenceau, to negotiate with Thiers in Versailles to obtain a special independent status for Paris.\n\nOn 22 March 1871, demonstrators holding banners declaring them to be \"Friends of Peace\" were blocked from entering the Place Vend\u00f4me by guardsmen who, after being fired on, opened fire on the crowd. At least 12 people were killed and many wounded.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Milner|first1=John|title=Art, War and Revolution in France, 1870\u20131871: Myth, Reportage and Reality|date=2000|publisher=Yale University Press|location=New Haven and London|isbn=0300084072|pages=143\u2013145|url=https://books.google.com/?id=_4h7VyVr4mgC&pg=PA143&lpg=PA143&dq=22+March+1871+paris+vendome#v=onepage&q=22%20March%201871%20paris%20vendome&f=false|accessdate=1 May 2018}}</ref>\n\n===Council elections===\n[[File:Commune 28 mars.jpeg|thumb|upright|The celebration of the election of the Commune, 28 March 1871]]\n\nIn Paris, hostility was growing between the elected republican mayors, including Clemenceau, who believed that they were legitimate leaders of Paris, and the Central Committee of the National Guard.<ref>Milza, 2009a, p. 97</ref> On 22 March, the day before the elections, the Central Committee declared that it, not the mayors, was the legitimate government of Paris.<ref>Milza, 2009a, p. 103</ref> It declared that Clemenceau was no longer the Mayor of Montmartre, and seized the city hall there, as well as the city halls of the 1st and 2nd ''arrondissements'', which were occupied by more radical national guardsmen. \"We are caught between two bands of crazy people,\" Clemenceau complained, \"those sitting in Versailles and those in Paris.\"\n\nThe elections of 26 March elected a Commune council of 92 members, one for every 20,000 residents. Ahead of the elections, the Central Committee and the leaders of the International gave out their lists of candidates, mostly belonging to the extreme left. The candidates had only a few days to campaign. Thiers' government in Versailles urged Parisians to abstain from voting. When the voting was finished, 233,000 Parisians had voted, out of 485,000 registered voters, or forty-eight percent. In upper-class neighborhoods many abstained from voting: 77 percent of voters in the 7th and 8th arrondissements; 68 percent in the 15th, 66 percent in the 16th, and 62 percent in the 6th and 9th. But in the working-class neighborhoods, turnout was high: 76 percent in the 20th arrondissement, 65 percent in the 19th, and 55 to 60 percent in the 10th, 11th, and 12th.<ref>Rougerie, Jacques, ''La Commune de Paris'', pp. 58\u201360</ref>\n\nA few candidates, including Blanqui (who had been arrested when outside Paris, and was in prison in Brittany), won in several ''arrondissements''. Other candidates who were elected, including about twenty moderate republicans and five radicals, refused to take their seats. In the end, the Council had just 60 members. Nine of the winners were Blanquists (some of whom were also from the International); twenty-five, including Delescluze and Pyat, classified themselves as \"Independent Revolutionaries\"; about fifteen were from the International; the rest were from a variety of radical groups. One of the best-known candidates, [[Georges Clemenceau]], received only 752 votes. The professions represented in the council were 33 workers; five small businessmen; 19 clerks, accountants and other office staff; twelve journalists; and a selection of workers in the liberal arts. All were men; women were not allowed to vote.<ref name=\"auto\">Milza, 2009a, pp. 109\u2013113</ref> The winners were announced on 27 March, and a large ceremony and parade by the National Guard was held the next day in front of the H\u00f4tel de Ville, decorated with red flags.\n\n===Organisation and early work===\n\nThe new Commune held its first meeting on 28 March in a euphoric mood. The members adopted a dozen proposals, including an honorary presidency for Blanqui; the abolition of the [[death penalty]]; the abolition of [[military conscription]]; a proposal to send delegates to other cities to help launch communes there; and a resolution declaring that membership in the Paris Commune was incompatible with being a member of the National Assembly. This was aimed particularly at [[Pierre Tirard]], the republican mayor of the 2nd ''arrondissement'', who had been elected to both Commune and National Assembly. Seeing the more radical political direction of the new Commune, Tirard and some twenty republicans decided it was wisest to resign from the Commune. A resolution was also passed, after a long debate, that the deliberations of the Council were to be secret, since the Commune was effectively at war with the government in Versailles and should not make its intentions known to the enemy.<ref>Milza, 2009a, pp. 118\u2013119</ref>\n\nFollowing the model proposed by the more radical members, the new government had no president, no mayor, and no commander in chief. The Commune began by establishing nine commissions, similar to those of the National Assembly, to manage the affairs of Paris. The commissions in turn reported to an Executive Commission. One of the first measures passed declared that military conscription was abolished, that no military force other than the National Guard could be formed or introduced into the capital, and that all healthy male citizens were members of the National Guard. The new system had one important weakness: the National Guard now had two different commanders. They reported to both the Central Committee of the National Guard and to the Executive Commission, and it was not clear which one was in charge of the inevitable war with Thiers' government.<ref>Milza, 2009a, p. 129</ref>\n\n==Administration and actions==\n\n===Programme===\n[[File:communepawnshop.jpg|thumb|The Commune returns workmen's tools pawned during the siege.]]\n\nThe Commune adopted the discarded [[French Republican Calendar]]<ref>{{cite book |last1=Robb |first1=Graham |title=Parisians: An Adventure History of Paris |date=2010 |publisher=W.

Despite internal differences, the Council began to organise the public services essential for a city of two million residents. It also reached a consensus on certain policies that tended towards a progressive, secular, and highly democratic [[social democracy]]. Because the Commune met on fewer than sixty days in all, only a few decrees were actually implemented. These included:\n* [[separation of church and state]];\n* remission of rents owed for the entire period of the siege (during which payment had been suspended);\n* abolition of [[child labour]] and [[night working|night work]] in bakeries;\n* granting of pensions to the unmarried companions and children of national guardsmen killed in active service;\n* free return by pawnshops of all workmen's tools and household items, valued up to 20 francs, pledged during the siege;\n* postponement of commercial debt obligations, and the abolition of interest on the debts;\n* [[workers' self-management|right of employees to take over and run an enterprise]] if it were deserted by its owner; the Commune, nonetheless, recognised the previous owner's right to compensation;\n* prohibition of fines imposed by employers on their workmen.<ref>''Marx and the Proletariat: A Study in Social Theory'' by Timothy McCarthy</ref>\n\nThe decrees separated the church from the state, appropriated all church property to public property, and excluded the practice of religion from schools. In theory, the churches were allowed to continue their religious activity only if they kept their doors open for public political meetings during the evenings. In practice, many churches were closed, and many priests were arrested and held as hostages, in the hope of trading them for Blanqui, imprisoned in Brittany since 17 March.<ref>Milza, 2009a</ref>\n\nThe workload of the Commune leaders was usually enormous. The Council members (who were not \"representatives\" but delegates, subject in theory to immediate recall by their electors) were expected to carry out many executive and military functions as well as their legislative ones. Numerous organisations were set up during the siege in the localities (''quartiers'') to meet social needs, such as canteens and first-aid stations. For example, in the [[3rd arrondissement of Paris|3rd ''arrondissement'']], school materials were provided free, three parochial schools were \"laicised\", and an orphanage was established. In the [[20th arrondissement of Paris|20th ''arrondissement'']], schoolchildren were provided with free clothing and food. At the same time, these local assemblies pursued their own goals, usually under the direction of local workers. Despite the moderate reformism of the Commune council, the composition of the Commune as a whole was much more revolutionary. Revolutionary factions included [[Proudhon]]ists (an early form of moderate anarchism), members of the international socialists, Blanquists, and more libertarian republicans.\n\n===Feminist initiatives===\n[[File:Louise Michel2.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Louise Michel]], anarchist and famed \"Red Virgin of Montmartre\", became an important part of the legend of the Commune.]]\n\nWomen played an important role in both the initiation and the governance of the Commune, though women could not vote in the Commune elections and there were no elected women members of the Commune itself.<ref name=\"auto\"/>  Their participation included building barricades and caring for wounded fighters.<ref name=\":0\" />  Jos\u00e9phine Marchias, a washer woman, picked up a gun during the battles of May 22-23rd and said, \"You cowardly crew!

A female battalion from the National Guard defended the [[Place Blanche]] during the repression.\n\n===Bank of France===\nThe Commune named Francis Jourde as the head of the Commission of Finance. A former clerk of a notary, accountant in a bank and employee of the city's bridges and roads department, Jourde maintained the Commune's accounts with prudence. Paris's tax receipts amounted to 20 million francs, with another six million seized at the Hotel de Ville. The expenses of the Commune were 42 million, the largest part going to pay the daily salary of the National Guard. Jourde first obtained a loan from the [[Rothschild & Co|Rothschild Bank]], then paid the bills from the city account, which was soon exhausted.\n\nThe gold reserves of the [[Bank of France]] had been moved out of Paris for safety in August 1870, but its vaults contained 88 million francs in gold coins and 166 million francs in banknotes. When the Thiers government left Paris in March, they did not have the time or the reliable soldiers to take the money with them. The reserves were guarded by 500 national guardsmen who were themselves Bank of France employees. Some Communards wanted to appropriate the bank's reserves to fund social projects, but Jourde resisted, explaining that without the gold reserves the currency would collapse and all the money of the Commune would be worthless. The Commune appointed [[Charles Beslay]] as the Commissaire of the Bank of France, and he arranged for the Bank to loan the Commune 400,000 francs a day. This was approved by Thiers, who felt that to negotiate a future peace treaty the Germans were demanding war reparations of five billion francs; the gold reserves would be needed to keep the franc stable and pay the indemnity. Jourde's prudence was later condemned by [[Karl Marx]] and other Marxists, who felt the Commune should have confiscated the bank's reserves and spent all the money immediately.<ref>Karl Marx: ''Selected Writings'' (ed.

Their offices were invaded and closed by crowds of the Commune's supporters. After 18 April other newspapers sympathetic to Versailles were also closed. The Versailles government, in turn, imposed strict censorship and prohibited any publication in favour of the Commune.\n\nAt the same time, the number of pro-Commune newspapers and magazines published in Paris during the Commune expanded exponentially. The most popular of the pro-Commune newspapers was ''Le Cri du Peuple,'' published by Jules Valles, which was published from 22 February until 23 May. Another highly popular publication was ''[[Le P\u00e8re Duchesne (19th century)|Le P\u00e8re Duch\u00eane]]'', inspired by a similar paper of the same name published from 1790 until 1794; after its first issue on 6 March, it was briefly closed by General Vinoy, but it reappeared until 23 May. It specialised in humour, vulgarity and extreme abuse against the opponents of the Commune.<ref>Milza, 2009a, p. 250</ref>\n\nA republican press also flourished, including such papers as ''Le Mot d'Ordre'' of Henri Rochefort, which was both violently anti-Versailles and critical of the faults and excesses of the Commune. The most popular republican paper was ''Le Rappel'', which condemned both Thiers and the killing of generals Lecomte and Clement-Thomas by the Communards.  Its editor Auguste Vacquerie was close to [[Victor Hugo]], whose son wrote for the paper. The editors wrote, \"We are against the National Assembly, but we are not for the Commune. That which we defend, that which we love, that which we admire, is Paris.\"<ref>Milza, 2009a, p. 253</ref>\n\n===Religious persecution===\nFrom the beginning, the Commune had a hostile relationship with the Catholic Church. On 2 April, soon after the Commune was established, it voted a decree accusing the Catholic Church of \"complicity in the crimes of the monarchy.\" The decree declared the separation of church and state, confiscated the state funds allotted to the Church, seized the property of religious congregations, and ordered that Catholic schools cease religious education and become secular. Over the next seven weeks, some two hundred priests, nuns and monks were arrested, and twenty-six churches were closed to the public. At the urging of the more radical newspapers, National Guard units searched the basements of churches, looking for evidence of alleged sadism and criminal practices. More extreme elements of the National Guard carried out mock religious processions and parodies of religious services. Early in May, some of the political clubs began to demand the immediate execution of Archbishop Darboy and the other priests in the prison. The Archbishop and a number of priests were executed during Bloody Week, in retaliation for the execution of Commune soldiers by the regular army.<ref>Milza, 2009a, pp. 350\u2013354</ref>\n\n===Destruction of the Vend\u00f4me Column===\n[[File:Colonne vendome.jpg|thumb|Destruction of the [[Vend\u00f4me Column]] during the Paris Commune. The column's destruction realized an official proposition made the previous September by painter [[Gustave Courbet]], who, after the collapse of the Commune, was sentenced to six months in prison and later ordered to pay for putting the column back up. He could never pay, and died soon after in exile.]]\n\nThe destruction of the [[Vend\u00f4me Column]] honouring the victories of Napoleon I, topped by a statue of the Emperor, was one of the most prominent civic events during the Commune. It was voted on 12 April by the executive committee of the Commune, which declared that the column was \"a monument of barbarism\" and a \"symbol of brute force and false pride.\" The idea had originally come from the painter [[Gustave Courbet]], who had written to the Government of National Defence on 4 September calling for the demolition of the column. In October, he had called for a new column, made of melted-down German cannons, \"the column of peoples, the column of Germany and France, forever federated.\" Courbet was elected to the Council of the Commune on 16 April, after the decision to tear down the column had already been made. The ceremonial destruction took place on 16 May. In the presence of two battalions of the National Guard and the leaders of the Commune, a band played \"[[La Marseillaise]]\" and the \"[[Chant du D\u00e9part]]\". The first effort to pull down the column failed, but at 5:30 in the afternoon the column broke from its base and shattered into three pieces. The pedestal was draped with red flags, and pieces of the statue were taken to be melted down and made into coins.<ref>Milza, 2009a, pp. 294\u2013296</ref>\n\nOn 12 May another civic event took place: the destruction of Thiers' home on Place Saint-Georges. Proposed by Henri Rochefort, editor of the ''Le Mot d'Ordre'', on 6 April, it had not been voted upon by the Commune until 10 May. According to the decree of the Commune, the works of art were to be donated to the [[Louvre]] (which refused them) and the furniture was to be sold, the money to be given to widows and orphans of the fighting. The house was emptied and destroyed on 12 May.<ref>Milza, 2009a, pp. 296\u2013298</ref>\n\n==War with the national government==\n\n===Failure of the march on Versailles===\nIn Versailles, Thiers had estimated that he needed 150,000 men to recapture Paris, and that he had only about 20,000 reliable first-line soldiers, plus about 5,000 gendarmes. He worked rapidly to assemble a new and reliable regular army. Most of the soldiers were prisoners of war who had just been released by the Germans, following the terms of the armistice. Others were sent from military units in all of the provinces. To command the new army, Thiers chose [[Patrice MacMahon]], who had won fame fighting the Austrians in Italy under Napoleon III, and who had been seriously wounded at the Battle of Sedan. He was highly popular both within the army and in the country. By 30 March, less than two weeks after the Army's Montmartre rout, it began skirmishing with the National Guard on the outskirts of Paris.\n\nIn Paris, members of the Military Commission and the Executive Committee of the Commune, as well as the Central Committee of the National Guard, met on 1 April. They decided to launch an offensive against the Army in Versailles within five days. The attack was first launched on the morning of 2 April by five battalions who crossed the Seine at the [[Pont de Neuilly]]. The National Guard troops were quickly repulsed by the Army, with a loss of about twelve soldiers. One officer of the Versailles army, a surgeon from the medical corps, was killed; the National Guardsmen had mistaken his uniform for that of a gendarme. Five national guardsmen were captured by the regulars; two were Army deserters and two were caught with their weapons in their hands. General Vinoy, the commander of the Paris Military District, had ordered any prisoners who were deserters from the Army to be shot. The commander of the regular forces, Colonel [[Georges Ernest Boulanger]], went further and ordered that all four prisoners be summarily shot. The practice of shooting prisoners captured with weapons became common in the bitter fighting in the weeks ahead.<ref>Milza, 2009a, pp. 138\u2013139</ref>\n\nDespite this first failure, Commune leaders were still convinced that, as at Montmartre, French army soldiers would refuse to fire on national guardsmen. They prepared a massive offensive of 27,000 national guardsmen who would advance in three columns. They were expected to converge at the end of 24 hours at the gates of the [[Palace of Versailles]]. They advanced on the morning of 3 April\u2014without cavalry to protect the flanks, without artillery, without stores of food and ammunition, and without ambulances\u2014confident of rapid success. They passed by the line of forts outside the city, believing them to be occupied by national guardsmen. In fact the army had re-occupied the abandoned forts on 28 March. The National Guard soon came under heavy artillery and rifle fire; they broke ranks and fled back to Paris. Once again national guardsmen captured with weapons were routinely shot by army units.<ref>Milza, 2009a, pp. 141\u2013152</ref>\n\n===Decree on Hostages===\nCommune leaders responded to the execution of prisoners by the Army by passing a new order on 5 April\u2014the Decree on Hostages. Under the decree, any person accused of complicity with the Versailles government could be immediately arrested, imprisoned and tried by a special jury of accusation. Those convicted by the jury would become \"hostages of the people of Paris.\" Article 5 stated, \"Every execution of a prisoner of war or of a partisan of the government of the Commune of Paris will be immediately followed by the execution of a triple number of hostages held by virtue of article four.\" Prisoners of war would be brought before a jury, which would decide if they would be released or held as hostages.<ref>Milza, 2009a, p. 153</ref>\n\nUnder the new decree, a number of prominent religious leaders were promptly arrested, including the Abb\u00e9 Deguerry, the [[cur\u00e9]] of the [[La Madeleine, Paris|Madeleine church]], and the archbishop of Paris [[Georges Darboy]], who was confined at the Mazas prison. The National Assembly in Versailles responded to the decree the next day; it passed a law allowing military tribunals to judge and punish suspects within 24 hours. [[\u00c9mile Zola]] wrote, \"Thus we citizens of Paris are placed between two terrible laws; the law of suspects brought back by the Commune and the law on rapid executions which will certainly be approved by the Assembly. They are not fighting with cannon shots, they are slaughtering each other with decrees.\"<ref>Zola, Emile, ''La Cloche'', 8 April 1871</ref>\n\n===Radicalisation===\n[[File:F\u00e9lix Pyat 1871.jpg|thumb|upright|The popular journalist [[F\u00e9lix Pyat]] became one of the most influential members of the Commune and its Committee for Public Safety. He went into exile during the Bloody Week, was later amnestied and elected to the National Assembly.]]\n\nBy April, as MacMahon's forces steadily approached Paris, divisions arose within the Commune about whether to give absolute priority to military defence, or to political and social freedoms and reforms. The majority, including the Blanquists and the more radical revolutionaries, supported by ''Le Vengeur'' of Pyat and ''Le P\u00e8re Duchesne'' of Vermersch, supported giving the military priority. The publications ''La Commune'', ''La Justice'' and Valles' ''Le Cri du Peuple'' feared that a more authoritarian government would destroy the kind of social republic they wanted to achieve. Soon, the Council of the Commune voted, with strong opposition, for the creation of a [[Committee of Public Safety]], modelled on the eponymous Committee that carried out the [[Reign of Terror]] (1793\u201394). Because of the implications carried by its name, many members of the Commune opposed the Committee of Public Safety's creation.\n\nThe Committee was given extensive powers to hunt down and imprison enemies of the Commune. Led by [[Raoul Rigault]], it began to make several arrests, usually on suspicion of treason, intelligence with the enemy, or insults to the Commune. Those arrested included General [[Edmond-Charles de Martimprey]], the governor of the Invalides, alleged to have caused the assassination of revolutionaries in December 1851\u2014as well as more recent commanders of the National Guard, including [[Gustave Cluseret]]. High religious officials had been arrested: Archbishop Darboy, the Vicar General Abb\u00e9 Lagarde, and the Cur\u00e9 of the Madeleine Abb\u00e9 Deguerry. The policy of holding hostages for possible reprisals was denounced by some defenders of the Commune, including Victor Hugo, in a poem entitled \"No Reprisals\" published in Brussels on 21 April.<ref>Milza, 2009a, pp. 346\u2013347</ref> On 12 April, Rigault proposed to exchange Archbishop Darboy and several other priests for the imprisoned Blanqui. Thiers refused the proposal. On 14 May, Rigault proposed to exchange 70 hostages for the extreme-left leader, and Thiers again refused.<ref>Milza, 2009a, pp. 345\u2013350</ref>\n\n===Composition of the National Guard===\n[[File:Barricade Paris 1871 by Pierre-Ambrose Richebourg.jpg|thumb|upright|A barricade constructed by the Commune in April 1871 on the Rue de Rivoli near the Hotel de Ville. The figures are blurred due to the camera's lengthy exposure time, an effect commonly seen in early photographs.]]\n\nSince every able-bodied man in Paris was obliged to be a member of the National Guard, the Commune on paper had an army of about 200,000 men on 6 May; the actual number was much lower, probably between 25,000 and 50,000 men. At the beginning of May, 20 percent of the National Guard was reported absent without leave. The National Guard had hundreds of cannons and thousands of rifles in its arsenal, but only half of the cannons and two-thirds of the rifles were ever used. There were heavy naval cannons mounted on the ramparts of Paris, but few national guardsmen were trained to use them. Between the end of April and 20 May, the number of trained artillerymen fell from 5,445 to 2,340.<ref name=\"Milza. Pierre p. 319\"/>\n\nThe officers of the National Guard were elected by the soldiers, and their leadership qualities and military skills varied widely. Gustave Clusaret, the commander of the National Guard until his dismissal on 1 May, had tried to impose more discipline in the army, disbanding many unreliable units and making soldiers live in barracks instead of at home. He recruited officers with military experience, particularly Polish officers who had fled to France in 1863, after Russians crushed the [[January Uprising]]; they played a prominent role in the last days of the Commune.<ref>Milza, 2009a, p. 317</ref> One of these officers was General [[Jaroslav Dombrowski]], a former Imperial Russian Army officer, who was appointed commander of the Commune forces on the right bank of the Seine. On 5 May, he was appointed commander of the Commune's whole army. Dombrowski held this position until 23 May, when he was killed while defending the city barricades.<ref>{{cite book|last=Zdrada|first=Jerzy|title=Jaros\u0142aw D\u0105browski 1836\u20131871|year=1973|publisher=Wydawnictwo Literackie|url=http://jbc.bj.uj.edu.pl/dlibra/doccontent?id=144915&from=FBC}}</ref>\n\n===Capture of Fort Issy===\nOne of the key strategic points around Paris was [[Fort Issy]], south of the city near the Porte de Versailles, which blocked the route of the Army into Paris. The fort's garrison was commanded by Leon Megy, a former mechanic and a militant Blanquist, who had been sentenced to 20 years hard labour for killing a policeman. After being freed he had led the takeover of the prefecture of Marseille by militant revolutionaries. When he came back to Paris, he was given the rank of colonel by the Central Committee of the National Guard, and the command of Fort Issy on 13 April.\n\nThe army commander, [[Ernest de Cissey|General Ernest de Cissey]], began a systematic siege and a heavy bombardment of the fort that lasted three days and three nights. At the same time Cissey sent a message to Colonel Megy, with the permission of Marshal MacMahon, offering to spare the lives of the fort's defenders, and let them return to Paris with their belongings and weapons, if they surrendered the fort. Colonel Megy gave the order, and during the night of 29\u201330 April, most of the soldiers evacuated the fort and returned to Paris. But news of the evacuation reached the Central Committee of the National Guard and the Commune. Before General Cissey and the Versailles army could occupy the fort, the National Guard rushed reinforcements there and re-occupied all the positions. General Cluseret, commander of the National Guard, was dismissed and put in prison. General Cissey resumed the intense bombardment of the fort. The defenders resisted until the night of 7\u20138 May, when the remaining national guardsmen in the fort, unable to withstand further attacks, decided to withdraw. The new commander of the National Guard, [[Louis Rossel]], issued a terse bulletin: \"The tricolor flag flies over the fort of Issy, abandoned yesterday by the garrison.\" The abandonment of the fort led the Commune to dismiss Rossel, and replace him with Delescluze, a fervent Communard but a journalist with no military experience.<ref>Milza, 2009a, pp. 327\u2013330</ref>\n\nBitter fighting followed, as MacMahon's army worked their way systematically forward to the walls of Paris. On 20 May, MacMahon's artillery batteries at Montretout, Mont-Valerian, Boulogne, Issy, and Vanves opened fire on the western neighbourhoods of the city\u2014Auteuil, Passy, and the Trocadero\u2014with shells falling close to l'\u00c9toile. Dombrowski reported that the soldiers he had sent to defend the ramparts of the city between Point du Jour and Porte d'Auteuil had retreated to the city; he had only 4,000 soldiers left at la Muette, 2,000 at Neuilly, and 200 at Asnieres and Saint Ouen. \"I lack artillerymen and workers to hold off the catastrophe.\"<ref>Milza, 2009a, p. 337</ref> On 19 May, while the Commune executive committee was meeting to judge the former military commander Cluseret for the loss of the Issy fortress, it received word that the forces of Marshal MacMahon were within the fortifications of Paris.\n\n==\"Bloody Week\" {{anchor|bloody week}}==\n''{{interlanguage link|Semaine sanglante|fr}}'' (''Bloody Week'') was the final assault by the French Armed Forces that ended the Paris Commune.\n\n===21 May: Army enters Paris===\n[[File:Jaroslaw Dabrowski.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Jaroslav Dombrowski]], a Polish exile and former military officer, was one of the few capable commanders of the National Guard. He was killed early in the Bloody Week.]]\n\nThe final offensive on Paris by MacMahon's army began early in the morning on Sunday, 21 May. On the front line, soldiers learned from a sympathiser inside the walls that the National Guard had withdrawn from one section of the city wall at Point-du-Jour, and the fortifications were undefended. An army engineer crossed the moat and inspected the empty fortifications, and immediately telegraphed the news to Marshal MacMahon, who was with Thiers at [[Fort Mont-Val\u00e9rien]]. MacMahon immediately gave orders, and two battalions passed through the fortifications without meeting anyone, and occupied the Porte de Saint-Cloud and the Porte de Versailles. By four o'clock in the morning, sixty thousand soldiers had passed into the city and occupied [[Auteuil-Neuilly-Passy|Auteuil]] and [[Passy]].<ref>Milza, 2009a, pp. 379\u2013380</ref>\n\nOnce the fighting began inside Paris, the strong neighborhood loyalties that had been an advantage of the Commune became something of a disadvantage: instead of an overall planned defence, each \"quartier\" fought desperately for its survival, and each was overcome in turn. The webs of narrow streets that made entire districts nearly impregnable in earlier Parisian revolutions had in the centre been replaced by wide [[boulevard]]s during [[Haussmann's renovation of Paris]]. The Versailles forces enjoyed a centralised command and had superior numbers. They had learned the tactics of street fighting and simply tunnelled through the walls of houses to outflank the Communards' barricades.\n\nThe trial of Gustave Cluseret, the former commander, was still going on at the Commune when they received the message from General Dombrowski that the army was inside the city. He asked for reinforcements and proposed an immediate counterattack. \"Remain calm,\" he wrote, \"and everything will be saved. We must not be defeated!\".<ref>Milza, 2009a, p. 381</ref> When they had received this news, the members of the Commune executive returned to their deliberations on the fate of Cluseret, which continued until eight o'clock that evening.\n\nThe first reaction of many of the National Guard was to find someone to blame, and Dombrowski was the first to be accused. Rumours circulated that he had accepted a million francs to give up the city. He was deeply offended by the rumours. They stopped when Dombrowski died two days later from wounds received on the barricades. His last reported words were: \"Do they still say I was a traitor?\"<ref name=\"Milza, 2009a, p. 394\">Milza, 2009a, p. 394</ref>\n\n===22 May: Barricades, first street battles===\n[[File:Commune de Paris barricade Place Blanche.jpg|thumb|A barricade on [[Place Blanche]] during Bloody Week, whose defenders included [[Louise Michel]] and a unit of 30 women]]\n\nOn the morning of 22 May, bells rang around the city, and Delescluze, as delegate for war of the Commune, issued a proclamation, posted all over Paris:\n\n{{quote|In the name of this glorious France, mother of all the popular revolutions, permanent home of the ideas of justice and solidarity which should be and will be the laws of the world, march at the enemy, and may your revolutionary energy show him that someone can sell Paris, but no one can give it up, or conquer it!

The forces of the Commune were outnumbered five-to-one by the army of Marshal MacMahon.<ref>Da Costa, Gaston, ''La Commune vecue, 3 vol. Paris, Librairies-impremeries reunies, 1903\u20131905, III, p. 81. Serman, William, ''La Commune de Paris'', p. 348</ref>\n\nOn the morning of 22 May, the regular army occupied a large area from the Porte Dauphine; to the Champs-de-Mars and the [[\u00c9cole Militaire]], where general Cissey established his headquarters; to the Porte de Vanves. In a short time the 5th corps of the army advanced toward [[Parc Monceau]] and [[Place Clichy]], while General Douay occupied the [[Place de l'\u00c9toile]] and General Clichant occupied the Gare Saint-Lazaire. Little resistance was encountered in the west of Paris, but the army moved forward slowly and cautiously, in no hurry.\n\nNo one had expected the army to enter the city, so only a few large barricades were already in place, on the Rue Saint-Florentin and Rue de l'Op\u00e9ra, and the Rue de Rivoli. Barricades had not been prepared in advance; some nine hundred barricades were built hurriedly out of paving stones and sacks of earth. Many other people prepared shelters in the cellars. The first serious fighting took place on the afternoon of the 22nd, an artillery duel between regular army batteries on the Quai d'Orsay and the Madeleine, and National Guard batteries on the terrace of the Tuileries Palace. On the same day, the first executions of National Guard soldiers by the regular army inside Paris took place; some sixteen prisoners captured on the Rue du Bac were given a summary hearing, and then shot.<ref>Milza, Pierre, \"La Commune\", p. 391</ref>\n\n===23 May: Battle for Montmartre; burning of Tuileries Palace===\n[[File:Combats dans la rue Rivoli.jpg|thumb|Communards defending a barricade on the [[Rue de Rivoli]]]]\n[[File:Les Ruines de Paris et de ses Environs 1870-1871, Cent Photographies, Premier Volume. DP161584.jpg|thumb|Ruins of the [[Tuileries Palace]], burned by the Communards on 23 May]]\n\nOn 23 May the next objective of the army was the butte of Montmartre, where the uprising had begun. The National Guard had built and manned a circle of barricades and makeshift forts around the base of the butte. The garrison of one barricade, at Chaussee Clignancourt, was defended in part by a battalion of about thirty women, including Louise Michel, the celebrated \"Red Virgin of Montmartre\", who had already participated in many battles outside the city. She was seized by regular soldiers and thrown into the trench in front of the barricade and left for dead. She escaped and soon afterwards surrendered to the army, to prevent the arrest of her mother. The battalions of the National Guard were no match for the army; by midday on the 23rd the regular soldiers were at the top of Montmartre, and the tricolor flag was raised over the Solferino tower. The soldiers captured 42 guardsmen and several women, took them to the same house on Rue Rosier where generals Clement-Thomas and Lecomte had been executed, and shot them. On the [[Rue Royale, Paris|Rue Royale]], soldiers seized the formidable barricade around the Madeleine church; 300 prisoners captured with their weapons were shot there, the largest of the mass executions of prisoners.<ref name=\"Milza, 2009a, p. 394\"/>\n\nOn the same day, having had little success fighting the army, units of national guardsmen began to take revenge by burning public buildings symbolising the government. The guardsmen led by [[Paul Brunel]], one of the original leaders of the Commune, took cans of oil and set fire to buildings near the Rue Royale and the Rue du Faubourg Saint-Honor\u00e9. Following the example set by Brunel, guardsmen set fire to dozens of other buildings on Rue Saint-Florentin, Rue de Rivoli, Rue de Bac, Rue de Lille, and other streets.\n\nThe [[Tuileries Palace]], which had been the residence of most of the monarchs of France from [[Henry IV of France|Henry IV]] to Napoleon III, was defended by a garrison of some three hundred National Guard with thirty cannon placed in the garden. They had been engaged in a day-long artillery duel with the regular army. At about seven in the evening, the commander of the garrison, Jules Bergeret, gave the order to burn the palace. The walls, floors, curtains and woodwork were soaked with oil and turpentine, and barrels of gunpowder were placed at the foot of the grand staircase and in the courtyard, then the fires were set. The fire lasted 48 hours and gutted the palace, except for the southernmost part, the ''Pavillon de Flore''.<ref>{{cite encyclopedia |encyclopedia=Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica |edition=14th |year=1956 |title=Paris |volume=17 |page=293}}</ref> Bergeret sent a message to the Hotel de Ville: \"The last vestiges of royalty have just disappeared.

Wounded men were being tended in the halls, and some of the National Guard officers and Commune members were changing from their uniforms into civilian clothes and shaving their beards, preparing to escape from the city. Delescluze ordered everyone to leave the building, and Brunel's men set it on fire.<ref>Milza, 2009a, pp. 397\u2013398</ref>\n\nThe battles resumed at daylight on 24 May, under a sky black with smoke from the burning palaces and ministries. There was no co-ordination or central direction on the Commune side; each neighborhood fought on its own. The National Guard disintegrated, with many soldiers changing into civilian clothes and fleeing the city, leaving between 10,000 and 15,000 Communards to defend the barricades. Delescluze moved his headquarters from the Hotel de Ville to the city hall of the 11th arrondissement. More public buildings were set afire, including the [[Palais de Justice, Paris|Palais de Justice]], the [[Paris Police Prefecture|Prefecture de Police]], the theatres of [[Th\u00e9\u00e2tre du Ch\u00e2telet|Ch\u00e2telet]] and [[Th\u00e9\u00e2tre de la Porte Saint-Martin|Porte-Saint-Martin]], and the [[Saint-Eustache, Paris|Church of Saint-Eustache]].  Most of the Palais de Justice was destroyed, but the [[Sainte-Chapelle]] survived. Fires set at [[the Louvre]], [[Palais-Royal]] and [[Notre-Dame de Paris|Notre-Dame]] were extinguished without causing significant damage.<ref>[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=pGTJAwAAQBAJ&pg=PA11 ''The Paris Commune 1871''], Robert Tombs, p.11</ref>\n\nAs the army continued its methodical advance, the summary executions of captured Communard soldiers by the army continued. Informal [[military court]]s were established at the [[\u00c9cole Polytechnique]], [[Place du Ch\u00e2telet|Ch\u00e2telet]], the [[Luxembourg Palace]], [[Parc Monceau]], and other locations around Paris. The hands of captured prisoners were examined to see if they had fired weapons. The prisoners gave their identity, sentence was pronounced by a court of two or three gendarme officers, the prisoners were taken out and sentences immediately carried out.<ref>Milza, 2009a, p. 401</ref>\n\nAmid the news of the growing number of executions carried out by the army in different parts of the city, the Communards carried out their own executions as a desperate and futile attempt at retaliation. Raoul Rigaut, the chairman of the Committee of Public Safety, without getting the authorisation of the Commune, executed one group of four prisoners, before he himself was captured and shot by an army patrol. On 24 May, a delegation of national guardsmen and Gustave Genton, a member of the Committee of Public Safety, came to the new headquarters of the Commune at the city hall of the 11th arrondissment and demanded the immediate execution of the hostages held at the prison of [[La Roquette Prisons|La Roquette]]. The new prosecutor of the Commune, [[Th\u00e9ophile Ferr\u00e9]], hesitated and then wrote a note: \"Order to the Citizen Director of La Roquette to execute six hostages.\" Genton asked for volunteers to serve as a firing squad, and went to the La Roquette prison, where many of the hostages were being held. Genton was given a list of hostages and selected six names, including Georges Darboy, the Archbishop of Paris and three priests. The governor of the prison, M.

MacMahon had his headquarters at the Quai d'Orsay. The insurgents held only the 11th, 12th, 19th and 20th arrondissements, and parts of the 3rd, 5th, and 13th. Delescluze and the remaining leaders of the Commune, about 20 in all, were at the city hall of the 13th arrondissement on Place Voltaire. A bitter battle took place between about 1,500 national guardsmen from the 13th arrondissement and the Mouffetard district, commanded by [[Walery Antoni Wr\u00f3blewski|Walery Wroblewski]], a Polish exile who had participated in the uprising against the Russians, against three brigades commanded by General de Cissey.<ref>Milza, 2009a, pp. 404\u2013407</ref>\n\nDuring the course of the 25th the insurgents lost the city hall of the 13th arrondissement and moved to a barricade on Place Jeanne-d'Arc, where 700 were taken prisoner. Wroblewski and some of his men escaped to the city hall of the 11th arrondissement, where he met Delescluze, the chief executive of the Commune. Several of the other Commune leaders, including Brunel, were wounded, and Pyat had disappeared. Delescluze offered Wroblewski the command of the Commune forces, which he declined, saying that he preferred to fight as a private soldier. At about seven-thirty Delescluze put on his red sash of office, walked unarmed to the barricade on the Place du Ch\u00e2teau-d'Eau, climbed to the top and showed himself to the soldiers, and was promptly shot dead.<ref>Lissagaray, Prosper-Olivier, ''Histoire de la Commune de 1871'', pp. 355\u2013356</ref>\n\n===26 May: Capture of Place de la Bastille; more executions===\nOn the afternoon of 26 May, after six hours of heavy fighting, the regular army captured the Place de la Bastille. The National Guard still held parts of the 3rd arrondissment, from the [[Carreau du Temple]] to the Arts-et-Metiers, and the National Guard still had artillery at their strong points at the Buttes-Chaumont and P\u00e8re-Lachaise, from which they continued to bombard the regular army forces along the [[Canal Saint-Martin]].<ref>Milza, 2009a, p. 410</ref>\n\nA contingent of several dozen national guardsmen led by Antoine Clavier, a commissaire and Emile Gois, a colonel of the National Guard, arrived at La Roquette prison and demanded, at gunpoint, the remaining hostages there: ten priests, thirty-five policemen and gendarmes, and two civilians. They took them first to the city hall of the 20th arrondissement; the Commune leader of that district refused to allow his city hall to be used as a place of execution. Clavier and Gois took them instead to Rue Haxo. The procession of hostages was joined by a large and furious crowd of national guardsmen and civilians who insulted, spat upon, and struck the hostages. Arriving at an open yard, they were lined up against a wall and shot in groups of ten. National guardsmen in the crowd opened fire along with the firing squad. The hostages were shot from all directions, then beaten with rifle butts and stabbed with bayonets.<ref>Milza, 2009a, pp. 411\u2013412</ref>   According to [[Prosper-Olivier Lissagaray]], a defender of the Commune, a  total of 63 people were executed by the Commune during the bloody week.<ref name=Lissagaray1 />\n\n===27\u201328 May: Final battles; massacre at P\u00e8re-Lachaise Cemetery===\n[[File:Maximilien Luce-The Execution of Varlin.jpg|thumb|[[Eug\u00e8ne Varlin]], one of the leaders of the Commune, was captured and shot by soldiers at Montmartre on 28 May, the last day of the uprising.]]\n\nOn the morning of 27 May, the regular army soldiers of Generals Grenier, [[Paul de Ladmirault|Ladmirault]] and Montaudon launched an attack on the National Guard artillery on the heights of the Buttes-Chaumont. The heights were captured at the end of the afternoon by the first regiment of the [[French Foreign Legion]]. One of the last remaining strongpoints of the National Guard was the cemetery of [[P\u00e8re-Lachaise]], defended by about 200 men. At 6:00 in the evening, the army used cannon to demolish the gates and the First Regiment of naval infantry stormed into the cemetery. Savage fighting followed around the tombs until nightfall, when the last 150 guardsmen, many of them wounded, were surrounded; and surrendered. The captured guardsmen were taken to the wall of the cemetery, known today as the [[Communards' Wall]], and shot.<ref>Milza, 2009a, pp. 413\u2013414</ref>\n\nOn 28 May, the regular army captured the last remaining positions of the Commune, which offered little resistance. In the morning the regular army captured La Roquette prison and freed the remaining 170 hostages. The army took 1,500 prisoners at the National Guard position on Rue Haxo, and 2,000 more at Derroja, near P\u00e8re-Lachaise. A handful of barricades at Rue Ramponneau and Rue de Tourville held out into the middle of the afternoon, when all resistance ceased.<ref>Milza, 2009a, p. 414</ref>\n\n==Communard prisoners and casualties==\n\n===Prisoners and exiles===\n[[File:Cadavres Soldats Federes Commune Paris 1871.jpg|thumb|Executed [[National Guard (France)|National Guards]]]]\n\nHundreds of prisoners who had been captured with weapons in their hands or gunpowder on their hands had been shot immediately. Others were taken to the main barracks of the army in Paris and after summary trials, were executed there. They were buried in mass graves in parks and squares. Not all prisoners were shot immediately; the French Army officially recorded the capture of 43,522 prisoners during and immediately after Bloody Week. Of these, 1,054 were women, and 615 were under the age of 16. They were marched in groups of 150 or 200, escorted by cavalrymen, to Versailles or the Camp de Satory where they were held in extremely crowded and unsanitary conditions until they could be tried. More than half of the prisoners, 22,727 to be exact, were released before trial for extenuating circumstances or on humanitarian grounds. Since Paris had been officially under a state of siege during the Commune, the prisoners were tried by military tribunals. Trials were held for 15,895 prisoners, of whom 13,500 were found guilty. Ninety-five were sentenced to death; 251 to forced labour; 1,169 to deportation, usually to New Caledonia; 3,147 to simple deportation; 1,257 to solitary confinement; 1,305 to prison for more than a year; and 2,054 to prison for less than a year.<ref>Milza, 2009a, pp. 431\u2013432</ref>\n\n[[File:Th\u00e9ophile Ferr\u00e9 by Appert.jpg|thumb|upright|left|The Commune's deputy prosecutor [[Th\u00e9ophile Ferr\u00e9]], who handed over six hostages for execution, was executed in November 1871.]]\n\nA separate and more formal trial was held beginning 7 August for the Commune leaders who survived and had been captured, including Th\u00e9ophile Ferr\u00e9, who had signed the death warrant for the hostages, and the painter Gustave Courbet, who had proposed the destruction of the column in Place Vend\u00f4me. They were tried by a panel of seven senior army officers. Ferr\u00e9 was sentenced to death, and Courbet was sentenced to six months in prison, and later ordered to pay the cost of rebuilding the column. He went into exile in Switzerland and died before making a single payment. Five women were also put on trial for participation in the Commune, including the \"Red Virgin\" Louise Michel. She demanded the death penalty, but was instead deported to New Caledonia.\n\nIn October 1871 a commission of the National Assembly reviewed the sentences; 310 of those convicted were pardoned, 286 had their sentences reduced, and 1,295 commuted.

The official army report by General F\u00e9lix Antoine Appert mentioned only Army casualties, which amounted, from April through May, to 877 killed, 6,454 wounded, and 183 missing.

All I can say is that the insurgents lost a lot more people than we did.\" Vacherot continued, \"Perhaps this number applies to all of the siege, and to the fighting at Forts d'Issy and Vanves.\" MacMahon replied, \"the number is exaggerated.\" Vacherot persisted, \"It was General Appert who gave me that information.

Du Camp had witnessed the last days of the Commune, went inside the Tuileries Palace shortly after the fires were put out, witnessed the executions of Communards by soldiers, and the bodies in the streets. He studied the question of the number of dead, and studied the records of the office of inspection of the Paris cemeteries, which was in charge of burying the dead. Based on their records, he reported that between 20 and 30 May, 5,339 corpses of Communards had been taken from the streets or Paris morgue to the city cemeteries for burial. Between 24 May and 6 September, the office of inspection of cemeteries reported that an additional 1,328 corpses were exhumed from temporary graves at 48 sites, including 754 corpses inside the old quarries near [[Parc des Buttes-Chaumont]], for a total of 6,667.<ref>du Camp, Maxime, ''Les Convulsions de Paris'', Hachette, (1881), p. 303.</ref> Modern Marxist critics attacked du Camp and his book; Collette Wilson called it \"a key text in the construction and promulgation of the reactionary memory of the Commune\" and Paul Lidsky called it \"the bible of the anti-Communard literature.\"<ref>{{cite book|last=Wilson|first=Colette|title=Paris and the Commune, 1871\u20131878: The Politics of Forgetting|date=2007|publisher=Manchester University Press|location=Manchester|page=20}}</ref> In 2012, however, historian [[Robert Tombs]] made a new study of the Paris cemetery records and placed the number killed between 6,000 and 7,000, confirming du Camp's research.<ref name=\"RTombs\"/> Jacques Rougerie, who had earlier accepted the 20,000 figure, wrote in 2014, \"the number ten thousand victims seems today the most plausible; it remains an enormous number for the time.\"<ref name=\"Rougerie, Jacques 1871, p. 118\"/>\n\n==Critique==\n\n===Contemporary artists and writers===\n[[File:Paris Commune rue de Rivoli.jpg|thumb|View of the Rue de Rivoli after Bloody Week]]\n\nFrench writers and artists had strong views about the Commune. [[Gustave Courbet]] was the most prominent artist to take part in the Commune, and was an enthusiastic participant and supporter, though he criticised its executions of suspected enemies.

The sound of firing squads, which one still hears in the mournful city, atrociously prolongs the nightmare ... Paris is sick of executions. It seems to Paris that they're shooting everyone.

It believes that, among the pile, there are innocent people, and that it's time that each execution is preceded by at least an attempt at a serious inquiry ...

Marx and [[Friedrich Engels|Engels]], Bakunin, and later Lenin, tried to draw major theoretical lessons (in particular as regards the \"[[dictatorship of the proletariat]]\" and the \"[[withering away of the state]]\") from the limited experience of the Commune.\n\nMarx, in ''[[The Civil War in France]]'' (1871), written during the Commune, praised the Commune's achievements, and described it as the prototype for a revolutionary government of the future, \"the form at last discovered\" for the emancipation of the proletariat. Marx wrote that, \"Working men's Paris, with its Commune, will be forever celebrated as the glorious harbinger of a new society. Its martyrs are enshrined in the great heart of the working class. Its exterminators, history has already nailed to that eternal pillory from which all of the prayers of their priest will not avail to redeem them.\"<ref>Karl Marx, ''The Civil War in France'', English Edition of 1871</ref>\n\nEngels echoed his partner, maintaining that the absence of a standing army, the self-policing of the \"quarters\", and other features meant that the Commune was no longer a \"state\" in the old, repressive sense of the term. It was a transitional form, moving towards the abolition of the state as such. He used the famous term later taken up by Lenin and the [[Bolsheviks]]: the Commune was, he said, the first \"dictatorship of the proletariat\", a state run by workers and in the interests of workers. But Marx and Engels were not entirely uncritical of the Commune. The split between the [[Marxists]] and [[anarchists]] at the [[Hague Congress (1872)|1872 Hague Congress]] of the First International (IWA) may in part be traced to Marx's stance that the Commune might have saved itself had it dealt more harshly with reactionaries, instituted conscription, and centralised decision-making in the hands of a revolutionary direction. The other point of disagreement was the [[anti-authoritarian]] socialists' opposition to the Communist conception of conquest of power and of a temporary transitional state: the anarchists were in favour of general strike and immediate dismantlement of the state through the constitution of decentralised workers' councils, as those seen in the Commune.\n\nLenin, like Marx, considered the Commune a living example of the \"dictatorship of the proletariat\". But he criticised the Communards for not having done enough to secure their position, highlighting two errors in particular. The first was that the Communards \"stopped half way ... led astray by dreams of ... establishing a higher [capitalist] justice in the country ... such institutions as the banks, for example, were not taken over\". Secondly, he thought their \"excessive magnanimity\" had prevented them from \"destroying\" the [[class enemy]]. For Lenin, the Communards \"underestimated the significance of direct military operations in civil war; and instead of launching a resolute offensive against Versailles that would have crowned its victory in Paris, it tarried and gave the Versailles government time to gather the dark forces and prepare for the blood-soaked week of May\".<ref>{{Cite book|last=Lenin|first=Vladimir Ilyich|author-link=Vladimir Lenin|translator-last=Isaacs|translator-first=Bernard|year=2004|orig-year=Originally published 23 March 1908 from speech at Geneva|chapter=Lessons of the Commune|chapter-url=https://www.marxists.org/archive/lenin/works/1908/mar/23.htm|title=Lenin Collected Works|url=https://www.marxists.org/archive/lenin/works/cw/index.htm|url-status=live|volume=[https://www.marxists.org/archive/lenin/works/cw/volume13.htm Volume 13: June 1907 \u2013 April 1908]|publisher=[[Progress Publishers]]|location=Moscow|publication-date=1972|pages=475\u2013478|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180312200100/https://www.marxists.org/archive/lenin/works/1908/mar/23.htm|archive-date=12 March 2018|access-date=12 March 2018|via=[[Marxists Internet Archive]] and Lenin Internet Archive; originally published in ''Zagranichnaya Gazeta'' (''Foreign Gazette''), No. 2}}</ref>\n\n===Other commentary===\n[[File:Jules Bergeret.jpg|thumb|upright|National Guard commander Jules Bergeret escaped Paris during the Bloody Week and went into exile in New York, where he died in 1905.]]\n\nThe American Ambassador in Paris during the Commune, [[Elihu Washburne]], writing in his personal diary which is quoted at length in noted historian [[David McCullough]]'s book, ''[[The Greater Journey]]'' (Simon & Schuster 2011), described the Communards as \"brigands\", \"assassins\", and \"scoundrels\"; \"I have no time now to express my detestation....

The Commune was regarded with admiration and awe by later Communist and leftist leaders. Vladimir Lenin wrote: \"We are only dwarves perched on the shoulders of those giants.\" He celebrated by dancing in the snow in Moscow on the day that his Bolshevik government was more than two months old, surpassing the Commune. The ministers and officials of the Bolshevik government were given the title ''[[Commissar]]'', which was borrowed directly from the ''Commissaires'' of the Commune. [[Lenin's Mausoleum]] in Moscow was (and still is) decorated with red banners from the Commune, brought to Moscow in 1924 by French communists.<ref name=\"Rougerie, Jacques p. 264\">Rougerie, Jacques, ''Paris libre \u2013 1871'', p. 264</ref> [[Joseph Stalin|Stalin]] wrote: \"In 1917 we thought that we would form a commune, an association of workers, and that we would put an end to bureaucracy...That is a goal that we are still far from reaching.\"<ref name=\"Rougerie, Jacques p. 264\" /> The [[Bolsheviks]] renamed their [[Russian battleship Sevastopol (1911)|dreadnought battleship ''Sevastopol'']] to ''Parizhskaya Kommuna''.

Their remains were later reburied in city cemeteries.[[File:Commune2011.jpg|thumb|A plaque honours the dead of the Commune in [[P\u00e8re Lachaise Cemetery]].]]\n\n===Other communes of 1871===\nSoon after the Paris Commune took power in Paris, revolutionary and socialist groups in several other French cities tried to establish their own communes. The Paris Commune sent delegates to the large cities to encourage them. The longest-lasting commune outside Paris was that in [[Marseille]], from 23 March to 4 April, which was suppressed with the loss of thirty soldiers and one hundred and fifty insurgents. None of the other Communes lasted more than a few days, and most ended with little or no bloodshed.\n* '''Lyon'''. [[Lyon]] had a long history of worker's movements and uprisings. On 28 September 1870, even before the Paris Commune, the anarchist [[Mikhail Bakunin]] and socialist Paul Clusaret led an unsuccessful attempt to seize the city hall in Lyon, but were stopped, arrested and expelled from the city by national guardsmen who supported the Republic. On 22 March, when the news of the seizure of power by the Paris Commune reached Lyon, socialist and revolutionary members of the National Guard met and heard a speech by a representative of the Paris Commune. They marched to the city hall, occupied it, and established a Commune of fifteen members, of whom eleven were militant revolutionaries. They arrested the mayor and the prefect of the city, hoisted a red flag over the city hall, and declared support for the Paris Commune. A delegate from the Paris Commune, Charles Amouroux, spoke to an enthusiastic crowd of several thousand people in front of the city hall. However, the following day the national guardsmen from other neighborhoods gathered at the city hall, held a meeting, and put out their own bulletin, declaring that the takeover was a \"regrettable misunderstanding,\" and declared their support for the government of the Republic. On 24 March, the four major newspapers of Lyon also repudiated the Commune. On 25 March, the last members of the Commune resigned and left the city hall peacefully. The Commune had lasted only two days.<ref>Milza, 2009a, pp. 158\u2013160</ref>\n* '''Saint-\u00c9tienne'''. On 24 March, inspired by the news from Paris, a crowd of republican and revolutionary workers and national guardsmen invaded the city hall of [[Saint-\u00c9tienne]], and demanded a plebiscite for the establishment of a Commune. Revolutionary members of the National Guard and a unit of regular army soldiers supporting the Republic were both outside the city. The prefect, an engineer named de L'Esp\u00e9e, was meeting with a delegation from the National Guard in his office when a shot was fired outside, killing a worker. The national guardsmen stormed the city hall, capturing the prefect. In the resulting chaos, more shots were fired and the prefect was killed. The National Guard members quickly established an Executive Committee, sent soldiers to occupy the railway station and telegraph office, and proclaimed a Commune, with elections to be held on 29 March. However, on the 26th, the more moderate republican members of the National Guard disassociated themselves from the Commune. An army unit entered the city on the morning of 28 March, and went to the city hall. The few hundred revolutionary national guardsmen still at the city hall dispersed quietly, without any shots being fired.<ref>Milza, 2009a, pp. 160\u2013162</ref>\n* '''Marseille'''. [[Marseille]], even before the Commune, had a strongly republican mayor and a tradition of revolutionary and radical movements. On 22 March, the socialist politician [[Gaston Cremieux]] addressed a meeting of workers in Marseille and called upon them to take up arms and to support the Paris Commune. Parades of radicals and socialists went into the street, chanting \"Long live Paris! Long live the Commune!\" On 23 March, the Prefect of the city called a mass meeting of the National Guard, expecting they would support the government; but, instead, the national guardsmen, as in Paris, stormed the city hall and took the mayor and prefect prisoner, and declared a Commune, led by a commission of six members, later increased to twelve, composed of both revolutionaries and moderate socialists. The military commander of Marseille, General Espivent de la Villeboisnet, withdrew his troops, along with many city government officials, outside Marseille, to Aubagne, to see what would happen. The revolutionary commission soon split into two factions, one in the city hall and the other in the prefecture, each claiming to be the legal government of the city. On 4 April, General Espivent, with six to seven thousand regular soldiers supported by sailors and National Guard units loyal to the Republic, entered Marseille, where the Commune was defended by about 2,000 national guardsmen. The regular army forces laid siege to the prefecture, defended by about 400 national guardsmen. The building was bombarded by artillery and then stormed by the soldiers and sailors. About 30 soldiers and 150 insurgents were killed. As in Paris, insurgents captured with weapons in hand were executed, and about 900 others were imprisoned. Gaston Cremieux was arrested, condemned to death in June 1871, and executed five months later.<ref>Milza, 2009a, pp. 165\u2013170</ref>\n* '''Other cities'''. There were attempts to establish Communes in other cities. A radical government briefly took charge in the industrial town of [[Le Creusot]], from 24 to 27 March, but left without violence when confronted by the army. The city hall, prefecture and arsenal of [[Toulouse]] were taken over by revolutionary national guardsmen on 24 March, but handed back to the army without fighting on 27 March. There was a similar short-lived takeover over the city hall in [[Narbonne]] (23\u201328 March). In [[Limoges]], no Commune was declared, but from 3 to 5 April revolutionary National Guard soldiers blockaded the city hall, mortally wounded an army colonel, and briefly prevented a regular army unit from being sent to Paris to fight the Commune, before being themselves disarmed by the army.<ref>Milza, 2009a, pp. 173\u2013176</ref>\n\n===Aftermath===\n* [[Adolphe Thiers]] was formally elected the first President of the [[French Third Republic]] on August 30, 1871. He was replaced by the more conservative Patrice MacMahon in 1873.   In his last years he became an ally of the republicans against the constitutional monarchists in the Assembly.  {{Sfn|Castries|1983|pages=422\u2013461}}  When he died in 1877,  his funeral was a major political event.  The historian [[Jules Ferry]] reported that a million Parisians lined the streets;  the funeral procession was led by the republican deputies [[Leon Gambetta]] and [[Victor Hugo]]. He was buried in [[P\u00e8re Lachaise Cemetery]], where one of the final battles of the Commune had been fought.{{sfn|Guiral|1986|page=366}}\n* [[Patrice MacMahon]], the leader of the regular army that crushed the Commune, served as the President of the Third Republic from 1873 to 1879.  When he died in 1893, he was buried with the highest military honours at the [[Invalides]].\n* [[Georges Clemenceau]], the mayor of Montmartre at the beginning of the Commune, became the leader of the Radical Party in the French Chamber of Deputies. He was [[Prime Minister of France]] during the crucial years of [[World War I]], and signed the [[Versailles Treaty]], restoring Alsace and Lorraine to France.\n\nSome leaders of the Commune, including Delescluze, died on the barricades, but most of the others survived and lived long afterwards, and some of them resumed political careers in France.\n* [[Felix Pyat]], the radical journalist, slipped out of Paris near the end of the Commune and reappeared as a refugee in London. He was sentenced to death ''[[Trial in absentia|in absentia]]'', but he and the other Communards were granted an amnesty. He returned to France, where he again became active in politics. He was elected to the Chamber of Deputies in March 1888, where he sat on the extreme left. He died in 1889.\n* [[Louis Auguste Blanqui]] had been elected the honorary President of the Commune, but he was in prison during its entire duration. He was sentenced to be transported to a penal colony in 1872, but because of his health his sentence was changed to imprisonment. He was elected a Deputy for Bordeaux in April 1879, but was disqualified. After he was released from prison, he continued his career as an agitator. He died after giving a speech in Paris in January 1881. Like Adolphe Thiers, he is buried in [[P\u00e8re Lachaise Cemetery]], where one of the last battles of the Commune was fought.\n* [[Louise Michel]], the famous \"Red Virgin\", was sentenced to transportation to a penal colony in New Caledonia, where she served as a schoolteacher. She was amnestied in 1880, and returned to Paris, where she resumed her career as an activist and anarchist. She was arrested in 1880 for leading a mob which pillaged a bakery, was imprisoned, and then pardoned. She was arrested several more times, and once was freed by the intervention of Georges Clemenceau. She died in 1905, and was buried near her close friend and colleague during the Commune, Th\u00e9ophile Ferr\u00e9, the man who had signed the death warrant for the Archbishop of Paris and other hostages.\n\n===In fiction===\n\n====Poetry====\n* Among the first to write about the Commune was [[Victor Hugo]], whose poem \"Sur une barricade\", written on 11 June 1871, and published in 1872 in a collection of poems under the name ''[[L'Ann\u00e9e terrible|L' Ann\u00e9e terrible]]'', honours the bravery of a twelve-year-old Communard being led to the execution squad.\n* [[William Morris|William Morris']] sequence of poems, \"The Pilgrims of Hope\" (1885), features a climax set in the Commune.<ref>\"In his later years, the story of the Commune so gripped Morris's imagination that it provided the climax for his long poem, \"The Pilgrims of Hope\"...

The Prix Goncourt winning novel is an account of the tumultuous events of 1871 told in free indirect style from the points of view of a policeman and a Communard tied together by the murder of a child and love for an Italian woman called Miss Pecci. The novel begins with the discovery of the corpse of a woman dumped in the Seine and the subsequent investigation in which the two main protagonists, Grondin and Tarpagnan, are involved. The eponymous newspaper, ''Le Cri du Peuple'', is inspired by the actual Communard newspaper edited by [[Jules Vall\u00e8s]]. The book itself is supposedly his account. The painter Gustave Courbet also makes an appearance.\n* In ''[[The Prague Cemetery]]'', Italian author [[Umberto Eco]] sets chapter 17 against the background of the Paris Commune.\n* ''The Queen of the Night'' by Alexander Chee (2016) depicts the survival of fictional opera singer Lilliet Berne during the siege of Paris. The novel's heroine also interacts with several notable figures of the day, including George Sand and the Empress Eug\u00e9nie de Montijo.\n* Several popular British and American novelists of the late 19th century depicted the Commune as a tyranny against which Anglo-Americans and their aristocratic French allies heroically pitted themselves.<ref name=\"ab\">Albert Boime, ''Olin Levi Warner's Defense of the Paris Commune'', Archives of American Art Journal, Vol. 29, No. 3/4 (1989), (pp. 4, 13)</ref> Among the most well-known of these anti-Commune novels are ''Woman of the Commune'' (1895, AKA ''A Girl of the Commune'') by [[G.

Chambers]].<ref name=\"ab\" />\n* In ''[[Marx Returns]]'' by the British writer and filmmaker [[Jason Barker]], the Commune provides the historical context to Karl Marx's revolutionary struggles, and is depicted \"as a symbol of an unfinished political project.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://politicsslashletters.org/marx-as-flawed-manic-and-one-of-us-a-review-of-marx-returns/|title=Marx as Flawed, Manic, and One of Us: a Review of Marx Returns|date=17 September 2018|publisher=}}</ref>\n\n====Theatre====\n* At least three plays have been set in the Commune: ''Nederlaget'' by [[Nordahl Grieg]], ''[[The Days of the Commune|Die Tage der Commune]]'' by [[Bertolt Brecht]], and ''Le Printemps 71'' by [[Arthur Adamov]].\n* Berlin performance group Showcase Beat le Mot created ''Paris 1871 Bonjour Commune'' (first performed at Hebbel am Ufer in 2010), the final part of a tetralogy dealing with failed revolutions.\n* New York theatre group [[The Civilians]] performed ''[[The Civilians#Paris Commune (2004, 2008)|Paris Commune]]'' in 2004 and 2008.\n\n====Film====\n* There have been numerous films set in the Commune. Particularly notable is ''[[La Commune (Paris, 1871)|La Commune]]'', which runs for 5\u00be hours and was directed by [[Peter Watkins]]. It was made in [[Montreuil, Seine-Saint-Denis|Montreuil]] in 2000, and as with most of Watkins' other films it uses ordinary people instead of actors to create a documentary effect. Some participants were the children of cast members from Watkin's masterpiece Edvard Munch (1974). La Commune was shot on film by Odd-Geir Saether, the Norwegian cameraman from the Munch film.\n* Soviet filmmakers [[Grigori Kozintsev]] and [[Leonid Trauberg]] wrote and directed, in 1929, the silent film ''[[The New Babylon]]'' (''Novyy Vavilon'') about the Paris Commune. It features [[Dmitri Shostakovich]]'s first film score.\n* British filmmaker Ken McMullen has made two films directly or indirectly influenced by the Commune: Ghost Dance (1983)and 1871 (1990). Ghost Dance is furthermore of interest due to the appearance of French philosopher Jacques Derrida.\n\n====Other====\n* The Italian composer [[Luigi Nono (composer)|Luigi Nono]] also wrote the opera ''[[Al gran sole carico d'amore]]'' (''In the Bright Sunshine, Heavy with Love''), which is based on the Paris Commune.\n* Comics artist [[Jacques Tardi]] translated the Vautrin's  novel (listed above) into a comic, which is also called ''Le Cri du Peuple''.\n* In the long-running British TV series ''[[The Onedin Line]]'' (episode 27, screened 10 December 1972), shipowner James Onedin is lured into the Commune in pursuit of a commercial debt and finds himself under heavy fire.\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Anarchism|Communism|Socialism|France}}\n{{columns-list |colwidth=25em |\n* [[Revolt of the Comuneros|Castilian War of the Communities]]\n* [[Commune (model of government)]]\n* [[Gustave Paul Cluseret]]\n* [[Gustave Flourens]]\n* [[Le\u00f3 Frankel]]\n* [[Andr\u00e9 Gill]]\n* [[Paschal Grousset]]\n* [[Paul Lafargue]]\n* [[\u00c9douard Manet]]\n* [[Medieval commune]]\n* [[Nadar (photographer)|Felix Nadar]]\n* [[Eug\u00e8ne Edine Pottier]]\n* [[\u00c9lis\u00e9e Reclus]]\n* [[Arthur Rimbaud]]\n* [[Louis Rossel]]\n* [[Jules Vall\u00e8s]]\n* [[Paul Verlaine]]\n* [[Strandzha Commune]]\n* [[Republic of Tarnobrzeg]]\n* [[Pittsburgh railroad strike of 1877]]\n}}\n\n==References==\n\n===Notes===\n{{Reflist|2}}\n\n===Bibliography===\n{{refbegin}}\n* {{cite book|last=Rougerie|first=Jacques|title=La Commune de 1871|year=2014|publisher=Presses universitaires de France| location=Paris|isbn=978-2-13-062078-5}}\n* {{cite book|last=Rougerie|first=Jacques|title=Paris libre 1871|year=2004|publisher=Editions du Seuil|location=Paris|isbn=2-02-055465-8}}\n* {{cite book|last=Milza |first=Pierre |title= L'ann\u00e9e terrible: La Commune (mars\u2013juin 1871)| year=2009a |publisher=Perrin |location=Paris | isbn=978-2-262-03073-5}}\n* {{cite book| last=Milza | first=Pierre| title= L'ann\u00e9e terrible: La guerre franco-prussienne (septembre 1870 \u2013 mars 1871) | year= 2009b |publisher= Perrin |location=Paris | isbn=978-2-262-02498-7}}\n* {{cite book|last=du Camp|first=Maxime|title=Les Convulsions de Paris|url=https://archive.org/details/lesconvulsionsde03ducauoft|year=1881|publisher=Hachette|location=Paris}}\n* ''The Red Republic, A Romance of The Commune'', Robert W.

The [[Franco-Prussian War]] had led to the capture of Emperor [[Napoleon III]] in September 1870, the collapse of the [[Second French Empire]], and the beginning of the [[French Third Republic|Third Republic]]. Because Paris was [[Siege of Paris (1870\u201371)|under siege for four months]], the Third Republic moved its capital to [[Tours]]. A hotbed of working-class radicalism, Paris was primarily defended during this time by the often politicised and radical troops of the [[National Guard (France)|National Guard]] rather than regular Army troops. Paris surrendered to the Prussians on 28 January 1871, and in February [[Adolphe Thiers]], the new chief executive of the French national government, signed an armistice with Prussia that disarmed the Army but not the National Guard.\n\nOn 18 March, soldiers of the Commune's National Guard killed two French army generals, and the Commune refused to accept the authority of the French government.  The Commune governed Paris for two months, until it was suppressed by the regular French Army during \"''La semaine sanglante''\" (\"The Bloody Week\") beginning on 21 May 1871.<ref>Robert Tombs, ''The War Against Paris, 1871'' (1981).</ref>\n\nDebates over the policies and outcome of the Commune had significant influence on the ideas of [[Karl Marx]], who described it as an example of the \"[[dictatorship of the proletariat]]\".<ref>Rougerie, Jacques, ''Paris libre- 1871''. pp. 264\u2013270</ref>\n\n==Prelude==\nOn 2 September 1870, after France's defeat at the [[Battle of Sedan (1870)|Battle of Sedan]] in the [[Franco-Prussian War]], Emperor [[Napoleon III]] surrendered to the Prussian Chancellor [[Otto von Bismarck]]. When the news reached Paris the next day, shocked and angry crowds came out into the streets. Empress [[Eug\u00e9nie de Montijo]], the Emperor's wife and acting Regent at the time, fled the city, and the Government of the [[French Second Empire|Second Empire]] swiftly collapsed. Republican and radical deputies of the [[National Assembly (France)|National Assembly]] went to the [[H\u00f4tel de Ville, Paris|H\u00f4tel de Ville]], proclaimed the [[French Third Republic|new French Republic]], and formed a [[Government of National Defense|Government of National Defence]]. Though the Emperor and the French Army had been defeated at Sedan, the war continued. The Prussian army marched swiftly toward Paris.\n\n===Demographics===\nIn 1871 France was deeply divided between the large rural, Catholic and conservative population of the French countryside and the more republican and radical cities of Paris, Marseille, Lyon and a few others. In the first round of the [[1869 French legislative election|1869 parliamentary elections]] held under the French Empire, 4,438,000 had voted for the [[Bonapartist]] candidates supporting Napoleon III, while 3,350,000 had voted for the republican opposition. In Paris, however, the republican candidates dominated, winning 234,000 votes against 77,000 for the Bonapartists.<ref name=\"Milza, Pierre p. 65\">Milza, 2009a, p. 65</ref>\n\nOf the two million people in Paris in 1869, according to the official census, there were about 500,000 industrial workers, or fifteen per cent of all the industrial workers in France, plus another 300,000\u2013400,000 workers in other enterprises. Only about 40,000 were employed in factories and large enterprises; most were employed in small industries in textiles, furniture and construction. There were also 115,000 servants and 45,000 concierges. In addition to the native French population, there were about 100,000 immigrant workers and political refugees, the largest number being from Italy and Poland.<ref name=\"Milza, Pierre p. 65\"/>\n\nDuring the war and the [[siege of Paris (1870\u201371)|siege of Paris]], various members of the middle- and upper-classes departed the city; at the same time there was an influx of refugees from parts of France occupied by the Germans. The working class and immigrants suffered the most from the lack of industrial activity due to the war and the siege; they formed the bedrock of the Commune's popular support.<ref name=\"Milza, Pierre p. 65\"/>\n\n===Radicalisation of the Paris workers===\nThe Commune resulted in part from growing discontent among the Paris workers.<ref>Haupt/Hausen 1979, pp. 74\u201375</ref> This discontent can be traced to the first worker uprisings, the [[Canut revolts]], in Lyon and Paris in the 1830s<ref>Edwards 1971, p. 1</ref> (a ''[[canut]]'' was a Lyonnais silk worker, often working on [[Jacquard loom]]s). Many Parisians, especially workers and the lower-middle classes, supported a democratic republic. A specific demand was that Paris should be self-governing with its own elected council, something enjoyed by smaller French towns but denied to Paris by a national government wary of the capital's unruly populace. They also wanted a more \"just\" way of managing the economy, if not necessarily [[socialist]], summed up in the popular appeal for \"''la r\u00e9publique d\u00e9mocratique et sociale!''\" (\"the democratic and social republic!\").{{citation needed|date=May 2012}}\n\nSocialist movements, such as the [[First International]], had been growing in influence with hundreds of societies affiliated to it across France. In early 1867, Parisian employers of bronze-workers attempted to de-unionise their workers. This was defeated by a strike organised by the International. Later in 1867, an illegal public demonstration in Paris was answered by the legal dissolution of its executive committee and the leadership being fined. Tensions escalated: Internationalists elected a new committee and put forth a more radical programme, the authorities imprisoned their leaders, and a more revolutionary perspective was taken to the International's [[First International#The Brussels Congress, 1868|1868 Brussels Congress]]. The International had considerable influence even among unaffiliated French workers, particularly in Paris and the big towns.<ref>{{cite book|last=March|first=Thomas|title=The history of the Paris Commune of 1871|year=1896|publisher=London, S.

The German military attach\u00e9, [[Alfred von Waldersee|Waldersee]], wrote in his diary in February: \"Every night isolated barricades were thrown up, constructed for the most part out of disused conveyances, especially omnibuses, a few shots were fired at random, and scenes of disorder were taken part in by a few hundreds of persons, mostly quite young\". He noted, however, that \"working-men, as a class, took no part in the proceedings.\"<ref>{{cite book|last1=Waldersee|first1=Alfred von|url=https://books.google.com/?id=K5CkDwAAQBAJ&pg=PT33&lpg=PT33&dq=%22working-men+as+a+class%22%22waldersee%22#v=onepage&q=%22working-men%20as%20a%20class%22%22waldersee%22&f=true|title=A Field Marshal's Memoirs: From the Diary, Correspondence and Reminiscences of Alfred, Count von Waldersee|isbn=978-1-163-18135-5|date=23 July 2019}}</ref> A coup was attempted in early 1870, but tensions eased significantly after the [[Second French Empire#Plebiscite of 1870|plebiscite in May]].

Revolutionaries had gone into the streets to oppose their governments during the popular uprisings of [[July Revolution|July 1830]] and [[June Days Uprising|June 1848]], and on many other occasions.\n\nOf the radical and revolutionary groups in Paris at the time of the Commune, the most conservative were the \"radical republicans\". This group included the young doctor and future prime minister [[Georges Clemenceau]], who was a member of the National Assembly and Mayor of the 18th [[arrondissements of France|arrondissement]]. Clemenceau tried to negotiate a compromise between the Commune and the government, but neither side trusted him; he was considered extremely radical by the provincial deputies of rural France, but too moderate by the leaders of the Commune.\n\nThe most extreme revolutionaries in Paris were the followers of [[Louis Auguste Blanqui]], a charismatic professional revolutionary who had spent most of his adult life in prison.<ref>{{Cite book|title=French socialists before Marx : workers, women and the social question in France|last=Pilbeam|first=Pamela M.|date=2000|publisher=McGill-Queen's University Press|isbn=9780773583856|location=Montreal|pages=33|oclc=767669805}}</ref> He had about a thousand followers, many of them armed and organized into [[Clandestine cell system|cells]] of ten persons each. Each cell operated independently and was unaware of the members of the other groups, communicating only with their leaders by code. Blanqui had written a manual on revolution, ''[[Instructions for an Armed Uprising]]'', to give guidance to his followers. Though their numbers were small, the [[Blanquists]] provided many of the most disciplined soldiers and several of the senior leaders of the Commune.\n\n===Defenders of Paris===\nBy 20 September 1870, the German army had surrounded Paris and was camped just {{convert|2000|m|ft}} from the French front lines. The regular French Army in Paris, under [[Louis-Jules Trochu|General Trochu]]'s command, had only 50,000 professional soldiers of the line; the majority of the French first-line soldiers were prisoners of war, or trapped in [[Metz]], surrounded by Germans. The regulars were thus supported by around 5,000 firemen, 3,000 gendarmes, and 15,000 sailors.<ref name=\"Milza, Pierre pp. 143-145\">Milza, 2009b, pp. 143\u2013145</ref> The regulars were also supported by the ''Garde Mobile'', new recruits with little training or experience. 17,000 of them were Parisian, and 73,000 from the provinces. These included twenty battalions of men from [[Brittany]], who spoke little French.<ref name=\"Milza, Pierre pp. 143-145\"/>\n\nThe largest armed force in Paris was the ''Garde Nationale'', or [[National Guard (France)|National Guard]], numbering about 300,000 men. They also had very little training or experience. They were organised by neighbourhoods; those from the upper- and middle-class ''[[arrondissement]]s'' tended to support the national government, while those from the working-class neighbourhoods were far more radical and politicised. Guardsmen from many units were known for their lack of discipline; some units refused to wear uniforms, often refused to obey orders without discussing them, and demanded the right to elect their own officers. The members of the National Guard from working-class neighbourhoods became the main armed force of the Commune.<ref name=\"Milza, Pierre pp. 143-145\"/>\n\n===Siege of Paris; first demonstrations===\n[[File:Varlin-eugene.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Eug\u00e8ne Varlin]] led several thousand National Guard soldiers to march to the Hotel de Ville chanting \"Long Live the Commune!\"]]\n\nAs the Germans surrounded the city, radical groups saw that the Government of National Defence had few soldiers to defend itself, and launched the first demonstrations against it. On 19 September, National Guard units from the main working-class neighbourhoods\u2014Belleville, Menilmontant, La Villette, Montrouge, the [[Faubourg Saint-Antoine]], and the Faubourg du Temple\u2014marched to the centre of the city and demanded that a new government, a Commune, be elected. They were met by regular army units loyal to the Government of National Defence, and the demonstrators eventually dispersed peacefully. On 5 October, 5,000 protesters marched from Belleville to the Hotel de Ville, demanding immediate municipal elections and rifles. On 8 October, several thousand soldiers from the National Guard, led by [[Eug\u00e8ne Varlin]] of the First International, marched to the centre chanting 'Long Live the Commune!\", but they also dispersed without incident.\n\nLater in October, General [[Louis Jules Trochu]] launched a series of armed attacks to break the German siege, with heavy losses and no success. The telegraph line connecting Paris with the rest of France had been cut by the Germans on 27 September. On 6 October, Defense Minister [[L\u00e9on Gambetta]] departed the city by balloon to try to organise national resistance against the Germans.<ref>Milza, 2009b, pp. 143\u2013165</ref>\n\n===Uprising of 31 October===\n[[File:Le 31 octobre 1870.jpg|thumb|upright|Revolutionary units of the National Guard briefly seized the Hotel de Ville on 31 October 1870, but the uprising failed.]]\n\nOn 28 October, the news arrived in Paris that the 160,000 soldiers of the French army at Metz, which had been surrounded by the Germans since August, had surrendered. The news arrived the same day of the failure of another attempt by the French army to break the siege of Paris at Bourget, with heavy losses. On 31 October, the leaders of the main revolutionary groups in Paris, including Blanqui, [[F\u00e9lix Pyat]] and [[Louis Charles Delescluze]], called new demonstrations at the Hotel de Ville against General Trochu and the government. Fifteen thousand demonstrators, some of them armed, gathered in front of the H\u00f4tel de Ville in pouring rain, calling for the resignation of Trochu and the proclamation of a commune. Shots were fired from the H\u00f4tel de Ville, one narrowly missing Trochu, and the demonstrators crowded into the building, demanding the creation of a new government, and making lists of its proposed members.<ref name=\"Milza, 2009b, pp. 206\u2013213\">Milza, 2009b, pp. 206\u2013213</ref>\n\nBlanqui, the leader of the most radical faction, established his own headquarters at the nearby [[Prefectures in France|Prefecture]] of the Seine, issuing orders and decrees to his followers, intent upon establishing his own government. While the formation of the new government was taking place inside the H\u00f4tel de Ville, however, units of the National Guard and ''Garde Mobile'' loyal to General Trochu arrived and recaptured the building without violence. By three o'clock, the demonstrators had been given safe passage and left, and the brief uprising was over.<ref name=\"Milza, 2009b, pp. 206\u2013213\"/>\n\nOn 3 November, city authorities organized a plebiscite of Parisian voters, asking if they had confidence in the Government of National Defence. \"Yes\" votes totalled 557,996, while 62,638 voted \"no\". Two days later, municipal councils in each of the twenty ''arrondissements'' of Paris voted to elect mayors; five councils elected radical opposition candidates, including Delescluze and a young Montmartrean doctor, [[Georges Clemenceau]].<ref>Milza, 2009b, pp. 212\u2013213</ref>\n\n===Negotiations with the Germans; continued war===\nIn September and October [[Adolphe Thiers]], the leader of the National Assembly conservatives, had toured Europe, consulting with the foreign ministers of Britain, Russia, and Austria, and found that none of them were willing to support France against the Germans. He reported to the Government that there was no alternative to negotiating an armistice. He travelled to German-occupied [[Tours]] and met with Bismarck on 1 November. The Chancellor demanded the cession of all of Alsace, parts of Lorraine, and enormous reparations. The Government of National Defence decided to continue the war and raise a new army to fight the Germans. The newly organized French armies won a single victory at [[Battle of Coulmiers|Coulmiers]] on 10 November, but an attempt by General [[Auguste-Alexandre Ducrot]] on 29 November at [[Battle of Villiers|Villiers]] to break out of Paris was defeated with a loss of 4,000 soldiers, compared with 1,700 German casualties.\n\nEveryday life for Parisians became increasingly difficult during the siege. In December temperatures dropped to {{convert|-15|C|F}}, and the [[Seine]] froze for three weeks. Parisians suffered shortages of food, firewood, coal and medicine. The city was almost completely dark at night. The only communication with the outside world was by balloon, carrier pigeon, or letters packed in iron balls floated down the Seine. Rumours and conspiracy theories abounded. Because supplies of ordinary food ran out, starving denizens ate most of the city zoo's animals, and then having eaten those, Parisians resorted to feeding on rats.\n\nBy early January 1871, Bismarck and the Germans themselves were tired of the prolonged siege. They installed seventy-two 120- and 150-mm artillery pieces in the forts around Paris and on 5 January began to bombard the city day and night. Between 300 and 600 shells hit the centre of the city every day.<ref>Milza, 2009b, pp. 257\u2013259</ref>\n\n===Uprising and armistice===\n{{Main|Armistice of Versailles}}\n\nBetween 11 and 19 January 1871, the French armies had been defeated on four fronts and Paris was facing a famine. General Trochu received reports from the prefect of Paris that agitation against the government and military leaders was increasing in the political clubs and in the National Guard of the working-class neighbourhoods of Belleville, La Chapelle, [[Montmartre]], and Gros-Caillou.{{Sfn|Milza|2009a|pages=420\u2013425}}\n\nAt midday on 22 January, three or four hundred National Guards and members of radical groups\u2014mostly Blanquists\u2014gathered outside the H\u00f4tel de Ville. A battalion of ''Gardes Mobiles'' from Brittany was inside the building to defend it in case of an assault. The demonstrators presented their demands that the military be placed under civil control, and that there be an immediate election of a commune. The atmosphere was tense, and in the middle of the afternoon, gunfire broke out between the two sides; each side blamed the other for firing first. Six demonstrators were killed, and the army cleared the square. The government quickly banned two publications, ''Le Reveil'' of Delescluze and ''Le Combat'' of Pyat, and arrested 83 revolutionaries. {{Sfn|Rougerie|2014|page=39}}\n\nAt the same time as the demonstration in Paris, the leaders of the Government of National Defence in Bordeaux had concluded that the war could not continue. On 26 January, they signed a ceasefire and armistice, with special conditions for Paris. The city would not be occupied by the Germans. Regular soldiers would give up their arms, but would not be taken into captivity. Paris would pay an indemnity of 200 million francs. At [[Jules Favre]]'s request, Bismarck agreed not to disarm the National Guard, so that order could be maintained in the city.{{sfn|Rougerie|2014|pages=40\u201341}}\n\n===Adolphe Thiers; parliamentary elections of 1871===\n{{See also|French legislative election, February 1871}}\n[[File:Adolphe Thiers Nadar 2.JPG|thumb|upright|[[Adolphe Thiers]], the chief executive of the French Government during the Commune]]\n\nThe national government in Bordeaux called for national elections at the end of January, held just ten days later on 8 February. Most electors in France were rural, Catholic and conservative, and this was reflected in the results; of the 645 deputies assembled in Bordeaux on February, about 400 favoured a constitutional monarchy under either [[Henri, Count of Chambord]] (grandson of [[Charles X of France|Charles X]]) or [[Prince Philippe, Count of Paris]] (grandson of [[Louis Philippe]]).<ref>Milza, 2009b, pp. 420\u2013421</ref>\n\nOf the 200 republicans in the new parliament, 80 were former [[Orl\u00e9anists]] (Philippe's supporters) and moderately conservative. They were led by Adolphe Thiers, who was elected in 26 departments, the most of any candidate. There were an equal number of more radical republicans, including Jules Favre and [[Jules Ferry]], who wanted a republic without a monarch, and who felt that signing the peace treaty was unavoidable. Finally, on the extreme left, there were the radical republicans and socialists, a group that included [[Louis Blanc]], L\u00e9on Gambetta and Georges Clemenceau. This group was dominant in Paris, where they won 37 of the 42 seats.<ref>Milza, 2009b, p. 421</ref>\n\nOn 17 February the new Parliament elected the 74-year-old Thiers as chief executive of the French Third Republic. He was considered to be the candidate most likely to bring peace and to restore order. Long an opponent of the Prussian war, Thiers persuaded Parliament that peace was necessary. He travelled to Versailles, where Bismarck and the German Emperor were waiting, and on 24 February the armistice was signed.\n\n==Establishment==\n\n===Dispute over cannons of Paris===\n[[File:communecannon.jpg|thumb|A contemporary sketch of women and children helping take two National Guard cannons to Montmartre]]\n\nAt the end of the war 400 obsolete muzzle-loading bronze cannons, partly paid for by the Paris public via a subscription, remained in the city. The new Central Committee of the National Guard, now dominated by radicals, decided to put the cannons in parks in the working-class neighborhoods of [[Belleville (Paris M\u00e9tro)|Belleville]], Buttes-Chaumont and Montmartre, to keep them away from the regular army and to defend the city against any attack by the national government. Thiers was equally determined to bring the cannons under national-government control.\n\nClemenceau, a friend of several revolutionaries, tried to negotiate a compromise; some cannons would remain in Paris and the rest go to the army. However, Thiers and the National Assembly did not accept his proposals. The chief executive wanted to restore order and national authority in Paris as quickly as possible, and the cannons became a symbol of that authority. The Assembly also refused to prolong the moratorium on debt collections imposed during the war; and suspended two radical newspapers, ''[[Jules Vall\u00e8s#Le Cri du Peuple|Le Cri du Peuple]]'' of [[Jules Valles]] and ''Le Mot d'Ordre'' of [[Victor Henri Rochefort, Marquis de Rochefort-Lu\u00e7ay|Henri Rochefort]], which further inflamed Parisian radical opinion. Thiers also decided to move the National Assembly and government from Bordeaux to Versailles, rather than to Paris, to be farther away from the pressure of demonstrations, which further enraged the National Guard and the radical political clubs.<ref>Milza, 2009a, pp. 8\u20139</ref>\n\nOn 17 March 1871, there was a meeting of Thiers and his cabinet, who were joined by Paris mayor [[Jules Ferry]], National Guard commander General [[Louis d'Aurelle de Paladines|D'Aurelle de Paladines]] and General [[Joseph Vinoy]], commander of the regular army units in Paris. Thiers announced a plan to send the army the next day to take charge of the cannons. The plan was initially opposed by War Minister [[Adolphe Le Fl\u00f4]], D'Aurelle de Paladines, and Vinoy, who argued that the move was premature, because the army had too few soldiers, was undisciplined and demoralized, and that many units had become politicized and were unreliable. Vinoy urged that they wait until Germany had released the French prisoners of war, and the army returned to full strength. Thiers insisted that the planned operation must go ahead as quickly as possible, to have the element of surprise. If the seizure of the cannon was not successful, the government would withdraw from the centre of Paris, build up its forces, and then attack with overwhelming force, as they had done during the uprising of June 1848. The Council accepted his decision, and Vinoy gave orders for the operation to begin the next day.<ref>Milza, 2009a, pp. 9\u201311</ref>\n\n===Failed seizure attempt and government retreat===\n[[File:Jacques L\u00e9on Cl\u00e9ment-Thomas (1809-1871).jpg|thumb|upright|The killing of Generals Cl\u00e9ment-Thomas (above) and Lecomte by national guardsmen on 18 March sparked the armed conflict between the French Army and the National Guard.]]\n\nEarly in the morning of 18 March, two brigades of soldiers climbed the butte of [[Montmartre]], where the largest collection of cannons, 170 in number, were located. A small group of revolutionary national guardsmen were already there, and there was a brief confrontation between the brigade led by General [[Claude Lecomte]], and the National Guard; one guardsman, named Turpin, was shot dead. Word of the shooting spread quickly, and members of the National Guard from all over the neighbourhood, including Clemenceau, hurried to the site to confront the soldiers.\n\nWhile the Army had succeeded in securing the cannons at [[Belleville, Paris|Belleville]] and [[Parc des Buttes-Chaumont|Buttes-Chaumont]] and other strategic points, at Montmartre a crowd gathered and continued to grow, and the situation grew increasingly tense. The horses that were needed to move the cannon away did not arrive, and the army units were immobilized. As the soldiers were surrounded, they began to break ranks and join the crowd. General Lecomte tried to withdraw, and then ordered his soldiers to load their weapons and fix bayonets. He thrice ordered them to fire, but the soldiers refused. Some of the officers were disarmed and taken to the city hall of Montmartre, under the protection of Clemenceau. General Lecomte and the officers of his staff were seized by the guardsmen and his mutinous soldiers and taken to the local headquarters of the National Guard at the ballroom of the [[Ch\u00e2teau Rouge (Paris M\u00e9tro)|Chateau-Rouge]]. The officers were pelted with rocks, struck, threatened, and insulted by the crowd. In the middle of the afternoon Lecomte and the other officers were taken to 6 Rue des Rosiers by members of a group calling themselves The Committee of Vigilance of the 18th ''arrondissement'', who demanded that they be tried and executed.<ref>Milza, 2009a, pp. 16\u201318</ref>\n\nAt 5:00 in the afternoon, the National Guard had captured another important prisoner: General [[Jacques Leon Cl\u00e9ment-Thomas]]. An ardent republican and fierce disciplinarian, he had helped suppress the armed uprising of June 1848 against the Second Republic. Because of his republican beliefs, he had been arrested by Napoleon III and exiled, and had only returned to France after the downfall of the Empire. He was particularly hated by the national guardsmen of Montmartre and Belleville because of the severe discipline he imposed during the siege of Paris.<ref>Milza, 2009a, pp. 18\u201319</ref> Earlier that day, dressed in civilian clothes, he had been trying to find out what was going on, when he was recognized by a soldier and arrested, and brought to the building at Rue des Rosiers. At about 5:30 on 18 March, the angry crowd of national guardsmen and deserters from Lecomte's regiment at Rue des Rosiers seized Cl\u00e9ment-Thomas, beat him with rifle butts, pushed him into the garden, and shot him repeatedly. A few minutes later, they did the same to General Lecomte. Doctor Guyon, who examined the bodies shortly afterwards, found forty balls in the body of Cl\u00e9ment-Thomas and nine balls in the back of Lecomte.<ref>Milza, 2009a, p. 19</ref>{{sfn|Gluckstein|2006|page=231}} By late morning, the operation to recapture the cannons had failed, and crowds and barricades were appearing in all the working-class neighborhoods of Paris. General Vinoy ordered the army to pull back to the Seine, and Thiers began to organise a withdrawal to Versailles, where he could gather enough troops to take back Paris.\n\nOn the afternoon of 18 March, following the government's failed attempt to seize the cannons at Montmartre, the Central Committee of the National Guard ordered the three battalions to seize the H\u00f4tel de Ville, where they believed the government was located. They were not aware that Thiers, the government, and the military commanders were at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, where the gates were open and there were few guards. They were also unaware that Marshal [[Patrice MacMahon]], the future commander of the forces against the Commune, had just arrived at his home in Paris, having just been released from imprisonment in Germany. As soon as he heard the news of the uprising, he made his way to the railway station, where national guardsmen were already stopping and checking the identity of departing passengers. A sympathetic station manager hid him in his office and helped him board a train, and he escaped the city. While he was at the railway station, national guardsmen sent by the Central Committee arrived at his house looking for him.<ref>Milza, 2009a, p. 76</ref>{{sfn|Gluckstein|2006|page=4}}\n\nOn the advice of General Vinoy, Thiers ordered the evacuation to Versailles of all the regular forces in Paris, some 40,000 soldiers, including those in the fortresses around the city; the regrouping of all the army units in Versailles; and the departure of all government ministries from the city.\n\n===National Guard takes power===\n[[File:Barricades pres de Ministere de la Marine et l'H\u00f6tel Crillon.jpg|thumb|Barricades during the Paris Commune, near the [[Place de la Concorde]]]]\n\nIn February, while the national government had been organising in Bordeaux, a new rival government had been organised in Paris. The National Guard had not been disarmed as per the armistice, and had on paper 260 battalions of 1,500 men each, a total of 390,000 men.<ref>Milza, 2009a, p. 35</ref> Between 15 and 24 February, some 500 delegates elected by the National Guard began meeting in Paris. On 15 March, just before the confrontation between the National Guard and the regular army over the cannons, 1,325 delegates of the federation of organisations created by the National Guard elected a leader, [[Giuseppe Garibaldi]] (who was in Italy and respectfully declined the title), and created a Central Committee of 38 members, which made its headquarters in a school on the [[Rue Basfroi]], between [[Place de la Bastille]] and [[La Roquette]]. The first vote of the new Central Committee was to refuse to recognise the authority of General D'Aurelle de Paladines, the official commander of the National Guard appointed by Thiers, or of General Vinoy, the Military Governor of Paris.<ref>Milza, 2009a, p. 45</ref>\n\nLate on 18 March, when they learned that the regular army was leaving Paris, units of the National Guard moved quickly to take control of the city. The first to take action were the followers of Blanqui, who went quickly to the [[Latin Quarter]] and took charge of the gunpowder stored in the [[Pantheon (Paris)|Pantheon]], and to the Orleans railway station. Four battalions crossed the Seine and captured the [[Paris Police Prefecture|prefecture of police]], while other units occupied the former headquarters of the National Guard at the [[Place Vend\u00f4me]], as well as the Ministry of Justice. That night, the National Guard occupied the offices vacated by the government; they quickly took over the Ministries of Finance, the Interior, and War. At eight in the morning the next day, the Central Committee was meeting in the H\u00f4tel de Ville. By the end of the day, 20,000 national guardsmen camped in triumph in the square in front of the H\u00f4tel de Ville, with several dozen cannons. A red flag was hoisted over the building.<ref>Milza, 2009a, p. 77</ref>\n\nThe extreme-left members of the Central Committee, led by the Blanquists, demanded an immediate march on Versailles to disperse the Thiers government and to impose their authority on all of France; but the majority first wanted to establish a more solid base of legal authority in Paris. The Committee officially lifted the state of siege, named commissions to administer the government, and called elections for 23 March. They also sent a delegation of mayors of the Paris ''arrondissements'', led by Clemenceau, to negotiate with Thiers in Versailles to obtain a special independent status for Paris.\n\nOn 22 March 1871, demonstrators holding banners declaring them to be \"Friends of Peace\" were blocked from entering the Place Vend\u00f4me by guardsmen who, after being fired on, opened fire on the crowd. At least 12 people were killed and many wounded.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Milner|first1=John|title=Art, War and Revolution in France, 1870\u20131871: Myth, Reportage and Reality|date=2000|publisher=Yale University Press|location=New Haven and London|isbn=0300084072|pages=143\u2013145|url=https://books.google.com/?id=_4h7VyVr4mgC&pg=PA143&lpg=PA143&dq=22+March+1871+paris+vendome#v=onepage&q=22%20March%201871%20paris%20vendome&f=false|accessdate=1 May 2018}}</ref>\n\n===Council elections===\n[[File:Commune 28 mars.jpeg|thumb|upright|The celebration of the election of the Commune, 28 March 1871]]\n\nIn Paris, hostility was growing between the elected republican mayors, including Clemenceau, who believed that they were legitimate leaders of Paris, and the Central Committee of the National Guard.<ref>Milza, 2009a, p. 97</ref> On 22 March, the day before the elections, the Central Committee declared that it, not the mayors, was the legitimate government of Paris.<ref>Milza, 2009a, p. 103</ref> It declared that Clemenceau was no longer the Mayor of Montmartre, and seized the city hall there, as well as the city halls of the 1st and 2nd ''arrondissements'', which were occupied by more radical national guardsmen. \"We are caught between two bands of crazy people,\" Clemenceau complained, \"those sitting in Versailles and those in Paris.\"\n\nThe elections of 26 March elected a Commune council of 92 members, one for every 20,000 residents. Ahead of the elections, the Central Committee and the leaders of the International gave out their lists of candidates, mostly belonging to the extreme left. The candidates had only a few days to campaign. Thiers' government in Versailles urged Parisians to abstain from voting. When the voting was finished, 233,000 Parisians had voted, out of 485,000 registered voters, or forty-eight percent. In upper-class neighborhoods many abstained from voting: 77 percent of voters in the 7th and 8th arrondissements; 68 percent in the 15th, 66 percent in the 16th, and 62 percent in the 6th and 9th. But in the working-class neighborhoods, turnout was high: 76 percent in the 20th arrondissement, 65 percent in the 19th, and 55 to 60 percent in the 10th, 11th, and 12th.<ref>Rougerie, Jacques, ''La Commune de Paris'', pp. 58\u201360</ref>\n\nA few candidates, including Blanqui (who had been arrested when outside Paris, and was in prison in Brittany), won in several ''arrondissements''. Other candidates who were elected, including about twenty moderate republicans and five radicals, refused to take their seats. In the end, the Council had just 60 members. Nine of the winners were Blanquists (some of whom were also from the International); twenty-five, including Delescluze and Pyat, classified themselves as \"Independent Revolutionaries\"; about fifteen were from the International; the rest were from a variety of radical groups. One of the best-known candidates, [[Georges Clemenceau]], received only 752 votes. The professions represented in the council were 33 workers; five small businessmen; 19 clerks, accountants and other office staff; twelve journalists; and a selection of workers in the liberal arts. All were men; women were not allowed to vote.<ref name=\"auto\">Milza, 2009a, pp. 109\u2013113</ref> The winners were announced on 27 March, and a large ceremony and parade by the National Guard was held the next day in front of the H\u00f4tel de Ville, decorated with red flags.\n\n===Organisation and early work===\n\nThe new Commune held its first meeting on 28 March in a euphoric mood. The members adopted a dozen proposals, including an honorary presidency for Blanqui; the abolition of the [[death penalty]]; the abolition of [[military conscription]]; a proposal to send delegates to other cities to help launch communes there; and a resolution declaring that membership in the Paris Commune was incompatible with being a member of the National Assembly. This was aimed particularly at [[Pierre Tirard]], the republican mayor of the 2nd ''arrondissement'', who had been elected to both Commune and National Assembly. Seeing the more radical political direction of the new Commune, Tirard and some twenty republicans decided it was wisest to resign from the Commune. A resolution was also passed, after a long debate, that the deliberations of the Council were to be secret, since the Commune was effectively at war with the government in Versailles and should not make its intentions known to the enemy.<ref>Milza, 2009a, pp. 118\u2013119</ref>\n\nFollowing the model proposed by the more radical members, the new government had no president, no mayor, and no commander in chief. The Commune began by establishing nine commissions, similar to those of the National Assembly, to manage the affairs of Paris. The commissions in turn reported to an Executive Commission. One of the first measures passed declared that military conscription was abolished, that no military force other than the National Guard could be formed or introduced into the capital, and that all healthy male citizens were members of the National Guard. The new system had one important weakness: the National Guard now had two different commanders. They reported to both the Central Committee of the National Guard and to the Executive Commission, and it was not clear which one was in charge of the inevitable war with Thiers' government.<ref>Milza, 2009a, p. 129</ref>\n\n==Administration and actions==\n\n===Programme===\n[[File:communepawnshop.jpg|thumb|The Commune returns workmen's tools pawned during the siege.]]\n\nThe Commune adopted the discarded [[French Republican Calendar]]<ref>{{cite book |last1=Robb |first1=Graham |title=Parisians: An Adventure History of Paris |date=2010 |publisher=W.

Despite internal differences, the Council began to organise the public services essential for a city of two million residents. It also reached a consensus on certain policies that tended towards a progressive, secular, and highly democratic [[social democracy]]. Because the Commune met on fewer than sixty days in all, only a few decrees were actually implemented. These included:\n* [[separation of church and state]];\n* remission of rents owed for the entire period of the siege (during which payment had been suspended);\n* abolition of [[child labour]] and [[night working|night work]] in bakeries;\n* granting of pensions to the unmarried companions and children of national guardsmen killed in active service;\n* free return by pawnshops of all workmen's tools and household items, valued up to 20 francs, pledged during the siege;\n* postponement of commercial debt obligations, and the abolition of interest on the debts;\n* [[workers' self-management|right of employees to take over and run an enterprise]] if it were deserted by its owner; the Commune, nonetheless, recognised the previous owner's right to compensation;\n* prohibition of fines imposed by employers on their workmen.<ref>''Marx and the Proletariat: A Study in Social Theory'' by Timothy McCarthy</ref>\n\nThe decrees separated the church from the state, appropriated all church property to public property, and excluded the practice of religion from schools. In theory, the churches were allowed to continue their religious activity only if they kept their doors open for public political meetings during the evenings. In practice, many churches were closed, and many priests were arrested and held as hostages, in the hope of trading them for Blanqui, imprisoned in Brittany since 17 March.<ref>Milza, 2009a</ref>\n\nThe workload of the Commune leaders was usually enormous. The Council members (who were not \"representatives\" but delegates, subject in theory to immediate recall by their electors) were expected to carry out many executive and military functions as well as their legislative ones. Numerous organisations were set up during the siege in the localities (''quartiers'') to meet social needs, such as canteens and first-aid stations. For example, in the [[3rd arrondissement of Paris|3rd ''arrondissement'']], school materials were provided free, three parochial schools were \"laicised\", and an orphanage was established. In the [[20th arrondissement of Paris|20th ''arrondissement'']], schoolchildren were provided with free clothing and food. At the same time, these local assemblies pursued their own goals, usually under the direction of local workers. Despite the moderate reformism of the Commune council, the composition of the Commune as a whole was much more revolutionary. Revolutionary factions included [[Proudhon]]ists (an early form of moderate anarchism), members of the international socialists, Blanquists, and more libertarian republicans.\n\n===Feminist initiatives===\n[[File:Louise Michel2.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Louise Michel]], anarchist and famed \"Red Virgin of Montmartre\", became an important part of the legend of the Commune.]]\n\nWomen played an important role in both the initiation and the governance of the Commune, though women could not vote in the Commune elections and there were no elected women members of the Commune itself.<ref name=\"auto\"/>  Their participation included building barricades and caring for wounded fighters.<ref name=\":0\" />  Jos\u00e9phine Marchias, a washer woman, picked up a gun during the battles of May 22-23rd and said, \"You cowardly crew!

They also demanded suppression of the distinction between married women and concubines, and between legitimate and illegitimate children.

A female battalion from the National Guard defended the [[Place Blanche]] during the repression.\n\n===Bank of France===\nThe Commune named Francis Jourde as the head of the Commission of Finance. A former clerk of a notary, accountant in a bank and employee of the city's bridges and roads department, Jourde maintained the Commune's accounts with prudence. Paris's tax receipts amounted to 20 million francs, with another six million seized at the Hotel de Ville. The expenses of the Commune were 42 million, the largest part going to pay the daily salary of the National Guard. Jourde first obtained a loan from the [[Rothschild & Co|Rothschild Bank]], then paid the bills from the city account, which was soon exhausted.\n\nThe gold reserves of the [[Bank of France]] had been moved out of Paris for safety in August 1870, but its vaults contained 88 million francs in gold coins and 166 million francs in banknotes. When the Thiers government left Paris in March, they did not have the time or the reliable soldiers to take the money with them. The reserves were guarded by 500 national guardsmen who were themselves Bank of France employees. Some Communards wanted to appropriate the bank's reserves to fund social projects, but Jourde resisted, explaining that without the gold reserves the currency would collapse and all the money of the Commune would be worthless. The Commune appointed [[Charles Beslay]] as the Commissaire of the Bank of France, and he arranged for the Bank to loan the Commune 400,000 francs a day. This was approved by Thiers, who felt that to negotiate a future peace treaty the Germans were demanding war reparations of five billion francs; the gold reserves would be needed to keep the franc stable and pay the indemnity. Jourde's prudence was later condemned by [[Karl Marx]] and other Marxists, who felt the Commune should have confiscated the bank's reserves and spent all the money immediately.<ref>Karl Marx: ''Selected Writings'' (ed.

Their offices were invaded and closed by crowds of the Commune's supporters. After 18 April other newspapers sympathetic to Versailles were also closed. The Versailles government, in turn, imposed strict censorship and prohibited any publication in favour of the Commune.\n\nAt the same time, the number of pro-Commune newspapers and magazines published in Paris during the Commune expanded exponentially. The most popular of the pro-Commune newspapers was ''Le Cri du Peuple,'' published by Jules Valles, which was published from 22 February until 23 May. Another highly popular publication was ''[[Le P\u00e8re Duchesne (19th century)|Le P\u00e8re Duch\u00eane]]'', inspired by a similar paper of the same name published from 1790 until 1794; after its first issue on 6 March, it was briefly closed by General Vinoy, but it reappeared until 23 May. It specialised in humour, vulgarity and extreme abuse against the opponents of the Commune.<ref>Milza, 2009a, p. 250</ref>\n\nA republican press also flourished, including such papers as ''Le Mot d'Ordre'' of Henri Rochefort, which was both violently anti-Versailles and critical of the faults and excesses of the Commune. The most popular republican paper was ''Le Rappel'', which condemned both Thiers and the killing of generals Lecomte and Clement-Thomas by the Communards.  Its editor Auguste Vacquerie was close to [[Victor Hugo]], whose son wrote for the paper. The editors wrote, \"We are against the National Assembly, but we are not for the Commune. That which we defend, that which we love, that which we admire, is Paris.\"<ref>Milza, 2009a, p. 253</ref>\n\n===Religious persecution===\nFrom the beginning, the Commune had a hostile relationship with the Catholic Church. On 2 April, soon after the Commune was established, it voted a decree accusing the Catholic Church of \"complicity in the crimes of the monarchy.\" The decree declared the separation of church and state, confiscated the state funds allotted to the Church, seized the property of religious congregations, and ordered that Catholic schools cease religious education and become secular. Over the next seven weeks, some two hundred priests, nuns and monks were arrested, and twenty-six churches were closed to the public. At the urging of the more radical newspapers, National Guard units searched the basements of churches, looking for evidence of alleged sadism and criminal practices. More extreme elements of the National Guard carried out mock religious processions and parodies of religious services. Early in May, some of the political clubs began to demand the immediate execution of Archbishop Darboy and the other priests in the prison. The Archbishop and a number of priests were executed during Bloody Week, in retaliation for the execution of Commune soldiers by the regular army.<ref>Milza, 2009a, pp. 350\u2013354</ref>\n\n===Destruction of the Vend\u00f4me Column===\n[[File:Colonne vendome.jpg|thumb|Destruction of the [[Vend\u00f4me Column]] during the Paris Commune.

It was voted on 12 April by the executive committee of the Commune, which declared that the column was \"a monument of barbarism\" and a \"symbol of brute force and false pride.\" The idea had originally come from the painter [[Gustave Courbet]], who had written to the Government of National Defence on 4 September calling for the demolition of the column. In October, he had called for a new column, made of melted-down German cannons, \"the column of peoples, the column of Germany and France, forever federated.\" Courbet was elected to the Council of the Commune on 16 April, after the decision to tear down the column had already been made. The ceremonial destruction took place on 16 May. In the presence of two battalions of the National Guard and the leaders of the Commune, a band played \"[[La Marseillaise]]\" and the \"[[Chant du D\u00e9part]]\". The first effort to pull down the column failed, but at 5:30 in the afternoon the column broke from its base and shattered into three pieces. The pedestal was draped with red flags, and pieces of the statue were taken to be melted down and made into coins.<ref>Milza, 2009a, pp. 294\u2013296</ref>\n\nOn 12 May another civic event took place: the destruction of Thiers' home on Place Saint-Georges. Proposed by Henri Rochefort, editor of the ''Le Mot d'Ordre'', on 6 April, it had not been voted upon by the Commune until 10 May. According to the decree of the Commune, the works of art were to be donated to the [[Louvre]] (which refused them) and the furniture was to be sold, the money to be given to widows and orphans of the fighting. The house was emptied and destroyed on 12 May.<ref>Milza, 2009a, pp. 296\u2013298</ref>\n\n==War with the national government==\n\n===Failure of the march on Versailles===\nIn Versailles, Thiers had estimated that he needed 150,000 men to recapture Paris, and that he had only about 20,000 reliable first-line soldiers, plus about 5,000 gendarmes. He worked rapidly to assemble a new and reliable regular army. Most of the soldiers were prisoners of war who had just been released by the Germans, following the terms of the armistice. Others were sent from military units in all of the provinces. To command the new army, Thiers chose [[Patrice MacMahon]], who had won fame fighting the Austrians in Italy under Napoleon III, and who had been seriously wounded at the Battle of Sedan. He was highly popular both within the army and in the country. By 30 March, less than two weeks after the Army's Montmartre rout, it began skirmishing with the National Guard on the outskirts of Paris.\n\nIn Paris, members of the Military Commission and the Executive Committee of the Commune, as well as the Central Committee of the National Guard, met on 1 April. They decided to launch an offensive against the Army in Versailles within five days. The attack was first launched on the morning of 2 April by five battalions who crossed the Seine at the [[Pont de Neuilly]]. The National Guard troops were quickly repulsed by the Army, with a loss of about twelve soldiers. One officer of the Versailles army, a surgeon from the medical corps, was killed; the National Guardsmen had mistaken his uniform for that of a gendarme. Five national guardsmen were captured by the regulars; two were Army deserters and two were caught with their weapons in their hands. General Vinoy, the commander of the Paris Military District, had ordered any prisoners who were deserters from the Army to be shot. The commander of the regular forces, Colonel [[Georges Ernest Boulanger]], went further and ordered that all four prisoners be summarily shot. The practice of shooting prisoners captured with weapons became common in the bitter fighting in the weeks ahead.<ref>Milza, 2009a, pp. 138\u2013139</ref>\n\nDespite this first failure, Commune leaders were still convinced that, as at Montmartre, French army soldiers would refuse to fire on national guardsmen. They prepared a massive offensive of 27,000 national guardsmen who would advance in three columns. They were expected to converge at the end of 24 hours at the gates of the [[Palace of Versailles]]. They advanced on the morning of 3 April\u2014without cavalry to protect the flanks, without artillery, without stores of food and ammunition, and without ambulances\u2014confident of rapid success. They passed by the line of forts outside the city, believing them to be occupied by national guardsmen. In fact the army had re-occupied the abandoned forts on 28 March. The National Guard soon came under heavy artillery and rifle fire; they broke ranks and fled back to Paris. Once again national guardsmen captured with weapons were routinely shot by army units.<ref>Milza, 2009a, pp. 141\u2013152</ref>\n\n===Decree on Hostages===\nCommune leaders responded to the execution of prisoners by the Army by passing a new order on 5 April\u2014the Decree on Hostages. Under the decree, any person accused of complicity with the Versailles government could be immediately arrested, imprisoned and tried by a special jury of accusation. Those convicted by the jury would become \"hostages of the people of Paris.\" Article 5 stated, \"Every execution of a prisoner of war or of a partisan of the government of the Commune of Paris will be immediately followed by the execution of a triple number of hostages held by virtue of article four.\" Prisoners of war would be brought before a jury, which would decide if they would be released or held as hostages.<ref>Milza, 2009a, p. 153</ref>\n\nUnder the new decree, a number of prominent religious leaders were promptly arrested, including the Abb\u00e9 Deguerry, the [[cur\u00e9]] of the [[La Madeleine, Paris|Madeleine church]], and the archbishop of Paris [[Georges Darboy]], who was confined at the Mazas prison. The National Assembly in Versailles responded to the decree the next day; it passed a law allowing military tribunals to judge and punish suspects within 24 hours. [[\u00c9mile Zola]] wrote, \"Thus we citizens of Paris are placed between two terrible laws; the law of suspects brought back by the Commune and the law on rapid executions which will certainly be approved by the Assembly. They are not fighting with cannon shots, they are slaughtering each other with decrees.\"<ref>Zola, Emile, ''La Cloche'', 8 April 1871</ref>\n\n===Radicalisation===\n[[File:F\u00e9lix Pyat 1871.jpg|thumb|upright|The popular journalist [[F\u00e9lix Pyat]] became one of the most influential members of the Commune and its Committee for Public Safety. He went into exile during the Bloody Week, was later amnestied and elected to the National Assembly.]]\n\nBy April, as MacMahon's forces steadily approached Paris, divisions arose within the Commune about whether to give absolute priority to military defence, or to political and social freedoms and reforms. The majority, including the Blanquists and the more radical revolutionaries, supported by ''Le Vengeur'' of Pyat and ''Le P\u00e8re Duchesne'' of Vermersch, supported giving the military priority. The publications ''La Commune'', ''La Justice'' and Valles' ''Le Cri du Peuple'' feared that a more authoritarian government would destroy the kind of social republic they wanted to achieve. Soon, the Council of the Commune voted, with strong opposition, for the creation of a [[Committee of Public Safety]], modelled on the eponymous Committee that carried out the [[Reign of Terror]] (1793\u201394). Because of the implications carried by its name, many members of the Commune opposed the Committee of Public Safety's creation.\n\nThe Committee was given extensive powers to hunt down and imprison enemies of the Commune. Led by [[Raoul Rigault]], it began to make several arrests, usually on suspicion of treason, intelligence with the enemy, or insults to the Commune. Those arrested included General [[Edmond-Charles de Martimprey]], the governor of the Invalides, alleged to have caused the assassination of revolutionaries in December 1851\u2014as well as more recent commanders of the National Guard, including [[Gustave Cluseret]]. High religious officials had been arrested: Archbishop Darboy, the Vicar General Abb\u00e9 Lagarde, and the Cur\u00e9 of the Madeleine Abb\u00e9 Deguerry. The policy of holding hostages for possible reprisals was denounced by some defenders of the Commune, including Victor Hugo, in a poem entitled \"No Reprisals\" published in Brussels on 21 April.<ref>Milza, 2009a, pp. 346\u2013347</ref> On 12 April, Rigault proposed to exchange Archbishop Darboy and several other priests for the imprisoned Blanqui. Thiers refused the proposal. On 14 May, Rigault proposed to exchange 70 hostages for the extreme-left leader, and Thiers again refused.<ref>Milza, 2009a, pp. 345\u2013350</ref>\n\n===Composition of the National Guard===\n[[File:Barricade Paris 1871 by Pierre-Ambrose Richebourg.jpg|thumb|upright|A barricade constructed by the Commune in April 1871 on the Rue de Rivoli near the Hotel de Ville. The figures are blurred due to the camera's lengthy exposure time, an effect commonly seen in early photographs.]]\n\nSince every able-bodied man in Paris was obliged to be a member of the National Guard, the Commune on paper had an army of about 200,000 men on 6 May; the actual number was much lower, probably between 25,000 and 50,000 men. At the beginning of May, 20 percent of the National Guard was reported absent without leave. The National Guard had hundreds of cannons and thousands of rifles in its arsenal, but only half of the cannons and two-thirds of the rifles were ever used. There were heavy naval cannons mounted on the ramparts of Paris, but few national guardsmen were trained to use them. Between the end of April and 20 May, the number of trained artillerymen fell from 5,445 to 2,340.<ref name=\"Milza. Pierre p. 319\"/>\n\nThe officers of the National Guard were elected by the soldiers, and their leadership qualities and military skills varied widely. Gustave Clusaret, the commander of the National Guard until his dismissal on 1 May, had tried to impose more discipline in the army, disbanding many unreliable units and making soldiers live in barracks instead of at home. He recruited officers with military experience, particularly Polish officers who had fled to France in 1863, after Russians crushed the [[January Uprising]]; they played a prominent role in the last days of the Commune.<ref>Milza, 2009a, p. 317</ref> One of these officers was General [[Jaroslav Dombrowski]], a former Imperial Russian Army officer, who was appointed commander of the Commune forces on the right bank of the Seine. On 5 May, he was appointed commander of the Commune's whole army. Dombrowski held this position until 23 May, when he was killed while defending the city barricades.<ref>{{cite book|last=Zdrada|first=Jerzy|title=Jaros\u0142aw D\u0105browski 1836\u20131871|year=1973|publisher=Wydawnictwo Literackie|url=http://jbc.bj.uj.edu.pl/dlibra/doccontent?id=144915&from=FBC}}</ref>\n\n===Capture of Fort Issy===\nOne of the key strategic points around Paris was [[Fort Issy]], south of the city near the Porte de Versailles, which blocked the route of the Army into Paris. The fort's garrison was commanded by Leon Megy, a former mechanic and a militant Blanquist, who had been sentenced to 20 years hard labour for killing a policeman. After being freed he had led the takeover of the prefecture of Marseille by militant revolutionaries. When he came back to Paris, he was given the rank of colonel by the Central Committee of the National Guard, and the command of Fort Issy on 13 April.\n\nThe army commander, [[Ernest de Cissey|General Ernest de Cissey]], began a systematic siege and a heavy bombardment of the fort that lasted three days and three nights. At the same time Cissey sent a message to Colonel Megy, with the permission of Marshal MacMahon, offering to spare the lives of the fort's defenders, and let them return to Paris with their belongings and weapons, if they surrendered the fort. Colonel Megy gave the order, and during the night of 29\u201330 April, most of the soldiers evacuated the fort and returned to Paris. But news of the evacuation reached the Central Committee of the National Guard and the Commune. Before General Cissey and the Versailles army could occupy the fort, the National Guard rushed reinforcements there and re-occupied all the positions. General Cluseret, commander of the National Guard, was dismissed and put in prison. General Cissey resumed the intense bombardment of the fort. The defenders resisted until the night of 7\u20138 May, when the remaining national guardsmen in the fort, unable to withstand further attacks, decided to withdraw. The new commander of the National Guard, [[Louis Rossel]], issued a terse bulletin: \"The tricolor flag flies over the fort of Issy, abandoned yesterday by the garrison.\" The abandonment of the fort led the Commune to dismiss Rossel, and replace him with Delescluze, a fervent Communard but a journalist with no military experience.<ref>Milza, 2009a, pp. 327\u2013330</ref>\n\nBitter fighting followed, as MacMahon's army worked their way systematically forward to the walls of Paris. On 20 May, MacMahon's artillery batteries at Montretout, Mont-Valerian, Boulogne, Issy, and Vanves opened fire on the western neighbourhoods of the city\u2014Auteuil, Passy, and the Trocadero\u2014with shells falling close to l'\u00c9toile. Dombrowski reported that the soldiers he had sent to defend the ramparts of the city between Point du Jour and Porte d'Auteuil had retreated to the city; he had only 4,000 soldiers left at la Muette, 2,000 at Neuilly, and 200 at Asnieres and Saint Ouen. \"I lack artillerymen and workers to hold off the catastrophe.\"<ref>Milza, 2009a, p. 337</ref> On 19 May, while the Commune executive committee was meeting to judge the former military commander Cluseret for the loss of the Issy fortress, it received word that the forces of Marshal MacMahon were within the fortifications of Paris.\n\n==\"Bloody Week\" {{anchor|bloody week}}==\n''{{interlanguage link|Semaine sanglante|fr}}'' (''Bloody Week'') was the final assault by the French Armed Forces that ended the Paris Commune.\n\n===21 May: Army enters Paris===\n[[File:Jaroslaw Dabrowski.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Jaroslav Dombrowski]], a Polish exile and former military officer, was one of the few capable commanders of the National Guard. He was killed early in the Bloody Week.]]\n\nThe final offensive on Paris by MacMahon's army began early in the morning on Sunday, 21 May. On the front line, soldiers learned from a sympathiser inside the walls that the National Guard had withdrawn from one section of the city wall at Point-du-Jour, and the fortifications were undefended. An army engineer crossed the moat and inspected the empty fortifications, and immediately telegraphed the news to Marshal MacMahon, who was with Thiers at [[Fort Mont-Val\u00e9rien]]. MacMahon immediately gave orders, and two battalions passed through the fortifications without meeting anyone, and occupied the Porte de Saint-Cloud and the Porte de Versailles. By four o'clock in the morning, sixty thousand soldiers had passed into the city and occupied [[Auteuil-Neuilly-Passy|Auteuil]] and [[Passy]].<ref>Milza, 2009a, pp. 379\u2013380</ref>\n\nOnce the fighting began inside Paris, the strong neighborhood loyalties that had been an advantage of the Commune became something of a disadvantage: instead of an overall planned defence, each \"quartier\" fought desperately for its survival, and each was overcome in turn. The webs of narrow streets that made entire districts nearly impregnable in earlier Parisian revolutions had in the centre been replaced by wide [[boulevard]]s during [[Haussmann's renovation of Paris]]. The Versailles forces enjoyed a centralised command and had superior numbers. They had learned the tactics of street fighting and simply tunnelled through the walls of houses to outflank the Communards' barricades.\n\nThe trial of Gustave Cluseret, the former commander, was still going on at the Commune when they received the message from General Dombrowski that the army was inside the city. He asked for reinforcements and proposed an immediate counterattack. \"Remain calm,\" he wrote, \"and everything will be saved. We must not be defeated!\".<ref>Milza, 2009a, p. 381</ref> When they had received this news, the members of the Commune executive returned to their deliberations on the fate of Cluseret, which continued until eight o'clock that evening.\n\nThe first reaction of many of the National Guard was to find someone to blame, and Dombrowski was the first to be accused. Rumours circulated that he had accepted a million francs to give up the city. He was deeply offended by the rumours. They stopped when Dombrowski died two days later from wounds received on the barricades. His last reported words were: \"Do they still say I was a traitor?\"<ref name=\"Milza, 2009a, p. 394\">Milza, 2009a, p. 394</ref>\n\n===22 May: Barricades, first street battles===\n[[File:Commune de Paris barricade Place Blanche.jpg|thumb|A barricade on [[Place Blanche]] during Bloody Week, whose defenders included [[Louise Michel]] and a unit of 30 women]]\n\nOn the morning of 22 May, bells rang around the city, and Delescluze, as delegate for war of the Commune, issued a proclamation, posted all over Paris:\n\n{{quote|In the name of this glorious France, mother of all the popular revolutions, permanent home of the ideas of justice and solidarity which should be and will be the laws of the world, march at the enemy, and may your revolutionary energy show him that someone can sell Paris, but no one can give it up, or conquer it!

The forces of the Commune were outnumbered five-to-one by the army of Marshal MacMahon.<ref>Da Costa, Gaston, ''La Commune vecue, 3 vol. Paris, Librairies-impremeries reunies, 1903\u20131905, III, p. 81. Serman, William, ''La Commune de Paris'', p. 348</ref>\n\nOn the morning of 22 May, the regular army occupied a large area from the Porte Dauphine; to the Champs-de-Mars and the [[\u00c9cole Militaire]], where general Cissey established his headquarters; to the Porte de Vanves. In a short time the 5th corps of the army advanced toward [[Parc Monceau]] and [[Place Clichy]], while General Douay occupied the [[Place de l'\u00c9toile]] and General Clichant occupied the Gare Saint-Lazaire. Little resistance was encountered in the west of Paris, but the army moved forward slowly and cautiously, in no hurry.\n\nNo one had expected the army to enter the city, so only a few large barricades were already in place, on the Rue Saint-Florentin and Rue de l'Op\u00e9ra, and the Rue de Rivoli. Barricades had not been prepared in advance; some nine hundred barricades were built hurriedly out of paving stones and sacks of earth. Many other people prepared shelters in the cellars. The first serious fighting took place on the afternoon of the 22nd, an artillery duel between regular army batteries on the Quai d'Orsay and the Madeleine, and National Guard batteries on the terrace of the Tuileries Palace. On the same day, the first executions of National Guard soldiers by the regular army inside Paris took place; some sixteen prisoners captured on the Rue du Bac were given a summary hearing, and then shot.<ref>Milza, Pierre, \"La Commune\", p. 391</ref>\n\n===23 May: Battle for Montmartre; burning of Tuileries Palace===\n[[File:Combats dans la rue Rivoli.jpg|thumb|Communards defending a barricade on the [[Rue de Rivoli]]]]\n[[File:Les Ruines de Paris et de ses Environs 1870-1871, Cent Photographies, Premier Volume. DP161584.jpg|thumb|Ruins of the [[Tuileries Palace]], burned by the Communards on 23 May]]\n\nOn 23 May the next objective of the army was the butte of Montmartre, where the uprising had begun. The National Guard had built and manned a circle of barricades and makeshift forts around the base of the butte. The garrison of one barricade, at Chaussee Clignancourt, was defended in part by a battalion of about thirty women, including Louise Michel, the celebrated \"Red Virgin of Montmartre\", who had already participated in many battles outside the city. She was seized by regular soldiers and thrown into the trench in front of the barricade and left for dead. She escaped and soon afterwards surrendered to the army, to prevent the arrest of her mother. The battalions of the National Guard were no match for the army; by midday on the 23rd the regular soldiers were at the top of Montmartre, and the tricolor flag was raised over the Solferino tower. The soldiers captured 42 guardsmen and several women, took them to the same house on Rue Rosier where generals Clement-Thomas and Lecomte had been executed, and shot them. On the [[Rue Royale, Paris|Rue Royale]], soldiers seized the formidable barricade around the Madeleine church; 300 prisoners captured with their weapons were shot there, the largest of the mass executions of prisoners.<ref name=\"Milza, 2009a, p. 394\"/>\n\nOn the same day, having had little success fighting the army, units of national guardsmen began to take revenge by burning public buildings symbolising the government. The guardsmen led by [[Paul Brunel]], one of the original leaders of the Commune, took cans of oil and set fire to buildings near the Rue Royale and the Rue du Faubourg Saint-Honor\u00e9. Following the example set by Brunel, guardsmen set fire to dozens of other buildings on Rue Saint-Florentin, Rue de Rivoli, Rue de Bac, Rue de Lille, and other streets.\n\nThe [[Tuileries Palace]], which had been the residence of most of the monarchs of France from [[Henry IV of France|Henry IV]] to Napoleon III, was defended by a garrison of some three hundred National Guard with thirty cannon placed in the garden. They had been engaged in a day-long artillery duel with the regular army. At about seven in the evening, the commander of the garrison, Jules Bergeret, gave the order to burn the palace. The walls, floors, curtains and woodwork were soaked with oil and turpentine, and barrels of gunpowder were placed at the foot of the grand staircase and in the courtyard, then the fires were set. The fire lasted 48 hours and gutted the palace, except for the southernmost part, the ''Pavillon de Flore''.<ref>{{cite encyclopedia |encyclopedia=Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica |edition=14th |year=1956 |title=Paris |volume=17 |page=293}}</ref> Bergeret sent a message to the Hotel de Ville: \"The last vestiges of royalty have just disappeared.

Wounded men were being tended in the halls, and some of the National Guard officers and Commune members were changing from their uniforms into civilian clothes and shaving their beards, preparing to escape from the city. Delescluze ordered everyone to leave the building, and Brunel's men set it on fire.<ref>Milza, 2009a, pp. 397\u2013398</ref>\n\nThe battles resumed at daylight on 24 May, under a sky black with smoke from the burning palaces and ministries. There was no co-ordination or central direction on the Commune side; each neighborhood fought on its own. The National Guard disintegrated, with many soldiers changing into civilian clothes and fleeing the city, leaving between 10,000 and 15,000 Communards to defend the barricades. Delescluze moved his headquarters from the Hotel de Ville to the city hall of the 11th arrondissement. More public buildings were set afire, including the [[Palais de Justice, Paris|Palais de Justice]], the [[Paris Police Prefecture|Prefecture de Police]], the theatres of [[Th\u00e9\u00e2tre du Ch\u00e2telet|Ch\u00e2telet]] and [[Th\u00e9\u00e2tre de la Porte Saint-Martin|Porte-Saint-Martin]], and the [[Saint-Eustache, Paris|Church of Saint-Eustache]].  Most of the Palais de Justice was destroyed, but the [[Sainte-Chapelle]] survived. Fires set at [[the Louvre]], [[Palais-Royal]] and [[Notre-Dame de Paris|Notre-Dame]] were extinguished without causing significant damage.<ref>[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=pGTJAwAAQBAJ&pg=PA11 ''The Paris Commune 1871''], Robert Tombs, p.11</ref>\n\nAs the army continued its methodical advance, the summary executions of captured Communard soldiers by the army continued. Informal [[military court]]s were established at the [[\u00c9cole Polytechnique]], [[Place du Ch\u00e2telet|Ch\u00e2telet]], the [[Luxembourg Palace]], [[Parc Monceau]], and other locations around Paris. The hands of captured prisoners were examined to see if they had fired weapons. The prisoners gave their identity, sentence was pronounced by a court of two or three gendarme officers, the prisoners were taken out and sentences immediately carried out.<ref>Milza, 2009a, p. 401</ref>\n\nAmid the news of the growing number of executions carried out by the army in different parts of the city, the Communards carried out their own executions as a desperate and futile attempt at retaliation. Raoul Rigaut, the chairman of the Committee of Public Safety, without getting the authorisation of the Commune, executed one group of four prisoners, before he himself was captured and shot by an army patrol. On 24 May, a delegation of national guardsmen and Gustave Genton, a member of the Committee of Public Safety, came to the new headquarters of the Commune at the city hall of the 11th arrondissment and demanded the immediate execution of the hostages held at the prison of [[La Roquette Prisons|La Roquette]]. The new prosecutor of the Commune, [[Th\u00e9ophile Ferr\u00e9]], hesitated and then wrote a note: \"Order to the Citizen Director of La Roquette to execute six hostages.\" Genton asked for volunteers to serve as a firing squad, and went to the La Roquette prison, where many of the hostages were being held. Genton was given a list of hostages and selected six names, including Georges Darboy, the Archbishop of Paris and three priests. The governor of the prison, M. Fran\u00e7ois, refused to give up the Archbishop without a specific order from the Commune. Genton sent a deputy back to the Prosecutor, who wrote \"and especially the archbishop\" on the bottom of his note. Archbishop Darboy and five other hostages were promptly taken out into the courtyard of the prison, lined up against the wall, and shot.<ref>Milza, 2009a, pp. 403\u2013404</ref>\n\n===25 May: Death of Delescluze===\n[[File:Louis Charles Delescluze.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Delescluze, the last military leader of the Commune, was shot dead after he stood atop a barricade, unarmed.]]\n\nBy the end of 24 May, the regular army had cleared most of the [[Latin Quarter, Paris|Latin Quarter]] barricades, and held three-fifths of Paris. MacMahon had his headquarters at the Quai d'Orsay. The insurgents held only the 11th, 12th, 19th and 20th arrondissements, and parts of the 3rd, 5th, and 13th. Delescluze and the remaining leaders of the Commune, about 20 in all, were at the city hall of the 13th arrondissement on Place Voltaire. A bitter battle took place between about 1,500 national guardsmen from the 13th arrondissement and the Mouffetard district, commanded by [[Walery Antoni Wr\u00f3blewski|Walery Wroblewski]], a Polish exile who had participated in the uprising against the Russians, against three brigades commanded by General de Cissey.<ref>Milza, 2009a, pp. 404\u2013407</ref>\n\nDuring the course of the 25th the insurgents lost the city hall of the 13th arrondissement and moved to a barricade on Place Jeanne-d'Arc, where 700 were taken prisoner. Wroblewski and some of his men escaped to the city hall of the 11th arrondissement, where he met Delescluze, the chief executive of the Commune.

They took them first to the city hall of the 20th arrondissement; the Commune leader of that district refused to allow his city hall to be used as a place of execution. Clavier and Gois took them instead to Rue Haxo. The procession of hostages was joined by a large and furious crowd of national guardsmen and civilians who insulted, spat upon, and struck the hostages. Arriving at an open yard, they were lined up against a wall and shot in groups of ten. National guardsmen in the crowd opened fire along with the firing squad. The hostages were shot from all directions, then beaten with rifle butts and stabbed with bayonets.<ref>Milza, 2009a, pp. 411\u2013412</ref>   According to [[Prosper-Olivier Lissagaray]], a defender of the Commune, a  total of 63 people were executed by the Commune during the bloody week.<ref name=Lissagaray1 />\n\n===27\u201328 May: Final battles; massacre at P\u00e8re-Lachaise Cemetery===\n[[File:Maximilien Luce-The Execution of Varlin.jpg|thumb|[[Eug\u00e8ne Varlin]], one of the leaders of the Commune, was captured and shot by soldiers at Montmartre on 28 May, the last day of the uprising.]]\n\nOn the morning of 27 May, the regular army soldiers of Generals Grenier, [[Paul de Ladmirault|Ladmirault]] and Montaudon launched an attack on the National Guard artillery on the heights of the Buttes-Chaumont. The heights were captured at the end of the afternoon by the first regiment of the [[French Foreign Legion]]. One of the last remaining strongpoints of the National Guard was the cemetery of [[P\u00e8re-Lachaise]], defended by about 200 men. At 6:00 in the evening, the army used cannon to demolish the gates and the First Regiment of naval infantry stormed into the cemetery. Savage fighting followed around the tombs until nightfall, when the last 150 guardsmen, many of them wounded, were surrounded; and surrendered. The captured guardsmen were taken to the wall of the cemetery, known today as the [[Communards' Wall]], and shot.<ref>Milza, 2009a, pp. 413\u2013414</ref>\n\nOn 28 May, the regular army captured the last remaining positions of the Commune, which offered little resistance.

Not all prisoners were shot immediately; the French Army officially recorded the capture of 43,522 prisoners during and immediately after Bloody Week. Of these, 1,054 were women, and 615 were under the age of 16. They were marched in groups of 150 or 200, escorted by cavalrymen, to Versailles or the Camp de Satory where they were held in extremely crowded and unsanitary conditions until they could be tried. More than half of the prisoners, 22,727 to be exact, were released before trial for extenuating circumstances or on humanitarian grounds. Since Paris had been officially under a state of siege during the Commune, the prisoners were tried by military tribunals. Trials were held for 15,895 prisoners, of whom 13,500 were found guilty. Ninety-five were sentenced to death; 251 to forced labour; 1,169 to deportation, usually to New Caledonia; 3,147 to simple deportation; 1,257 to solitary confinement; 1,305 to prison for more than a year; and 2,054 to prison for less than a year.<ref>Milza, 2009a, pp. 431\u2013432</ref>\n\n[[File:Th\u00e9ophile Ferr\u00e9 by Appert.jpg|thumb|upright|left|The Commune's deputy prosecutor [[Th\u00e9ophile Ferr\u00e9]], who handed over six hostages for execution, was executed in November 1871.]]\n\nA separate and more formal trial was held beginning 7 August for the Commune leaders who survived and had been captured, including Th\u00e9ophile Ferr\u00e9, who had signed the death warrant for the hostages, and the painter Gustave Courbet, who had proposed the destruction of the column in Place Vend\u00f4me.

All I can say is that the insurgents lost a lot more people than we did.\" Vacherot continued, \"Perhaps this number applies to all of the siege, and to the fighting at Forts d'Issy and Vanves.\" MacMahon replied, \"the number is exaggerated.\" Vacherot persisted, \"It was General Appert who gave me that information.

Du Camp had witnessed the last days of the Commune, went inside the Tuileries Palace shortly after the fires were put out, witnessed the executions of Communards by soldiers, and the bodies in the streets. He studied the question of the number of dead, and studied the records of the office of inspection of the Paris cemeteries, which was in charge of burying the dead. Based on their records, he reported that between 20 and 30 May, 5,339 corpses of Communards had been taken from the streets or Paris morgue to the city cemeteries for burial. Between 24 May and 6 September, the office of inspection of cemeteries reported that an additional 1,328 corpses were exhumed from temporary graves at 48 sites, including 754 corpses inside the old quarries near [[Parc des Buttes-Chaumont]], for a total of 6,667.<ref>du Camp, Maxime, ''Les Convulsions de Paris'', Hachette, (1881), p. 303.</ref> Modern Marxist critics attacked du Camp and his book; Collette Wilson called it \"a key text in the construction and promulgation of the reactionary memory of the Commune\" and Paul Lidsky called it \"the bible of the anti-Communard literature.\"<ref>{{cite book|last=Wilson|first=Colette|title=Paris and the Commune, 1871\u20131878: The Politics of Forgetting|date=2007|publisher=Manchester University Press|location=Manchester|page=20}}</ref> In 2012, however, historian [[Robert Tombs]] made a new study of the Paris cemetery records and placed the number killed between 6,000 and 7,000, confirming du Camp's research.<ref name=\"RTombs\"/> Jacques Rougerie, who had earlier accepted the 20,000 figure, wrote in 2014, \"the number ten thousand victims seems today the most plausible; it remains an enormous number for the time.\"<ref name=\"Rougerie, Jacques 1871, p. 118\"/>\n\n==Critique==\n\n===Contemporary artists and writers===\n[[File:Paris Commune rue de Rivoli.jpg|thumb|View of the Rue de Rivoli after Bloody Week]]\n\nFrench writers and artists had strong views about the Commune.

The sound of firing squads, which one still hears in the mournful city, atrociously prolongs the nightmare ... Paris is sick of executions. It seems to Paris that they're shooting everyone.

It believes that, among the pile, there are innocent people, and that it's time that each execution is preceded by at least an attempt at a serious inquiry ...

Marx and [[Friedrich Engels|Engels]], Bakunin, and later Lenin, tried to draw major theoretical lessons (in particular as regards the \"[[dictatorship of the proletariat]]\" and the \"[[withering away of the state]]\") from the limited experience of the Commune.\n\nMarx, in ''[[The Civil War in France]]'' (1871), written during the Commune, praised the Commune's achievements, and described it as the prototype for a revolutionary government of the future, \"the form at last discovered\" for the emancipation of the proletariat. Marx wrote that, \"Working men's Paris, with its Commune, will be forever celebrated as the glorious harbinger of a new society. Its martyrs are enshrined in the great heart of the working class. Its exterminators, history has already nailed to that eternal pillory from which all of the prayers of their priest will not avail to redeem them.\"<ref>Karl Marx, ''The Civil War in France'', English Edition of 1871</ref>\n\nEngels echoed his partner, maintaining that the absence of a standing army, the self-policing of the \"quarters\", and other features meant that the Commune was no longer a \"state\" in the old, repressive sense of the term. It was a transitional form, moving towards the abolition of the state as such. He used the famous term later taken up by Lenin and the [[Bolsheviks]]: the Commune was, he said, the first \"dictatorship of the proletariat\", a state run by workers and in the interests of workers. But Marx and Engels were not entirely uncritical of the Commune. The split between the [[Marxists]] and [[anarchists]] at the [[Hague Congress (1872)|1872 Hague Congress]] of the First International (IWA) may in part be traced to Marx's stance that the Commune might have saved itself had it dealt more harshly with reactionaries, instituted conscription, and centralised decision-making in the hands of a revolutionary direction. The other point of disagreement was the [[anti-authoritarian]] socialists' opposition to the Communist conception of conquest of power and of a temporary transitional state: the anarchists were in favour of general strike and immediate dismantlement of the state through the constitution of decentralised workers' councils, as those seen in the Commune.\n\nLenin, like Marx, considered the Commune a living example of the \"dictatorship of the proletariat\". But he criticised the Communards for not having done enough to secure their position, highlighting two errors in particular. The first was that the Communards \"stopped half way ... led astray by dreams of ... establishing a higher [capitalist] justice in the country ... such institutions as the banks, for example, were not taken over\". Secondly, he thought their \"excessive magnanimity\" had prevented them from \"destroying\" the [[class enemy]].

The Commune was regarded with admiration and awe by later Communist and leftist leaders. Vladimir Lenin wrote: \"We are only dwarves perched on the shoulders of those giants.\" He celebrated by dancing in the snow in Moscow on the day that his Bolshevik government was more than two months old, surpassing the Commune. The ministers and officials of the Bolshevik government were given the title ''[[Commissar]]'', which was borrowed directly from the ''Commissaires'' of the Commune. [[Lenin's Mausoleum]] in Moscow was (and still is) decorated with red banners from the Commune, brought to Moscow in 1924 by French communists.<ref name=\"Rougerie, Jacques p. 264\">Rougerie, Jacques, ''Paris libre \u2013 1871'', p. 264</ref> [[Joseph Stalin|Stalin]] wrote: \"In 1917 we thought that we would form a commune, an association of workers, and that we would put an end to bureaucracy...That is a goal that we are still far from reaching.\"<ref name=\"Rougerie, Jacques p. 264\" /> The [[Bolsheviks]] renamed their [[Russian battleship Sevastopol (1911)|dreadnought battleship ''Sevastopol'']] to ''Parizhskaya Kommuna''.

Their remains were later reburied in city cemeteries.[[File:Commune2011.jpg|thumb|A plaque honours the dead of the Commune in [[P\u00e8re Lachaise Cemetery]].]]\n\n===Other communes of 1871===\nSoon after the Paris Commune took power in Paris, revolutionary and socialist groups in several other French cities tried to establish their own communes. The Paris Commune sent delegates to the large cities to encourage them. The longest-lasting commune outside Paris was that in [[Marseille]], from 23 March to 4 April, which was suppressed with the loss of thirty soldiers and one hundred and fifty insurgents. None of the other Communes lasted more than a few days, and most ended with little or no bloodshed.\n* '''Lyon'''. [[Lyon]] had a long history of worker's movements and uprisings. On 28 September 1870, even before the Paris Commune, the anarchist [[Mikhail Bakunin]] and socialist Paul Clusaret led an unsuccessful attempt to seize the city hall in Lyon, but were stopped, arrested and expelled from the city by national guardsmen who supported the Republic. On 22 March, when the news of the seizure of power by the Paris Commune reached Lyon, socialist and revolutionary members of the National Guard met and heard a speech by a representative of the Paris Commune. They marched to the city hall, occupied it, and established a Commune of fifteen members, of whom eleven were militant revolutionaries. They arrested the mayor and the prefect of the city, hoisted a red flag over the city hall, and declared support for the Paris Commune. A delegate from the Paris Commune, Charles Amouroux, spoke to an enthusiastic crowd of several thousand people in front of the city hall. However, the following day the national guardsmen from other neighborhoods gathered at the city hall, held a meeting, and put out their own bulletin, declaring that the takeover was a \"regrettable misunderstanding,\" and declared their support for the government of the Republic. On 24 March, the four major newspapers of Lyon also repudiated the Commune. On 25 March, the last members of the Commune resigned and left the city hall peacefully. The Commune had lasted only two days.<ref>Milza, 2009a, pp. 158\u2013160</ref>\n* '''Saint-\u00c9tienne'''. On 24 March, inspired by the news from Paris, a crowd of republican and revolutionary workers and national guardsmen invaded the city hall of [[Saint-\u00c9tienne]], and demanded a plebiscite for the establishment of a Commune. Revolutionary members of the National Guard and a unit of regular army soldiers supporting the Republic were both outside the city. The prefect, an engineer named de L'Esp\u00e9e, was meeting with a delegation from the National Guard in his office when a shot was fired outside, killing a worker. The national guardsmen stormed the city hall, capturing the prefect. In the resulting chaos, more shots were fired and the prefect was killed. The National Guard members quickly established an Executive Committee, sent soldiers to occupy the railway station and telegraph office, and proclaimed a Commune, with elections to be held on 29 March. However, on the 26th, the more moderate republican members of the National Guard disassociated themselves from the Commune. An army unit entered the city on the morning of 28 March, and went to the city hall. The few hundred revolutionary national guardsmen still at the city hall dispersed quietly, without any shots being fired.<ref>Milza, 2009a, pp. 160\u2013162</ref>\n* '''Marseille'''. [[Marseille]], even before the Commune, had a strongly republican mayor and a tradition of revolutionary and radical movements. On 22 March, the socialist politician [[Gaston Cremieux]] addressed a meeting of workers in Marseille and called upon them to take up arms and to support the Paris Commune. Parades of radicals and socialists went into the street, chanting \"Long live Paris! Long live the Commune!\" On 23 March, the Prefect of the city called a mass meeting of the National Guard, expecting they would support the government; but, instead, the national guardsmen, as in Paris, stormed the city hall and took the mayor and prefect prisoner, and declared a Commune, led by a commission of six members, later increased to twelve, composed of both revolutionaries and moderate socialists. The military commander of Marseille, General Espivent de la Villeboisnet, withdrew his troops, along with many city government officials, outside Marseille, to Aubagne, to see what would happen. The revolutionary commission soon split into two factions, one in the city hall and the other in the prefecture, each claiming to be the legal government of the city. On 4 April, General Espivent, with six to seven thousand regular soldiers supported by sailors and National Guard units loyal to the Republic, entered Marseille, where the Commune was defended by about 2,000 national guardsmen. The regular army forces laid siege to the prefecture, defended by about 400 national guardsmen. The building was bombarded by artillery and then stormed by the soldiers and sailors. About 30 soldiers and 150 insurgents were killed. As in Paris, insurgents captured with weapons in hand were executed, and about 900 others were imprisoned. Gaston Cremieux was arrested, condemned to death in June 1871, and executed five months later.<ref>Milza, 2009a, pp. 165\u2013170</ref>\n* '''Other cities'''. There were attempts to establish Communes in other cities. A radical government briefly took charge in the industrial town of [[Le Creusot]], from 24 to 27 March, but left without violence when confronted by the army. The city hall, prefecture and arsenal of [[Toulouse]] were taken over by revolutionary national guardsmen on 24 March, but handed back to the army without fighting on 27 March. There was a similar short-lived takeover over the city hall in [[Narbonne]] (23\u201328 March). In [[Limoges]], no Commune was declared, but from 3 to 5 April revolutionary National Guard soldiers blockaded the city hall, mortally wounded an army colonel, and briefly prevented a regular army unit from being sent to Paris to fight the Commune, before being themselves disarmed by the army.<ref>Milza, 2009a, pp. 173\u2013176</ref>\n\n===Aftermath===\n* [[Adolphe Thiers]] was formally elected the first President of the [[French Third Republic]] on August 30, 1871. He was replaced by the more conservative Patrice MacMahon in 1873.   In his last years he became an ally of the republicans against the constitutional monarchists in the Assembly.  {{Sfn|Castries|1983|pages=422\u2013461}}  When he died in 1877,  his funeral was a major political event.  The historian [[Jules Ferry]] reported that a million Parisians lined the streets;  the funeral procession was led by the republican deputies [[Leon Gambetta]] and [[Victor Hugo]]. He was buried in [[P\u00e8re Lachaise Cemetery]], where one of the final battles of the Commune had been fought.{{sfn|Guiral|1986|page=366}}\n* [[Patrice MacMahon]], the leader of the regular army that crushed the Commune, served as the President of the Third Republic from 1873 to 1879.  When he died in 1893, he was buried with the highest military honours at the [[Invalides]].\n* [[Georges Clemenceau]], the mayor of Montmartre at the beginning of the Commune, became the leader of the Radical Party in the French Chamber of Deputies. He was [[Prime Minister of France]] during the crucial years of [[World War I]], and signed the [[Versailles Treaty]], restoring Alsace and Lorraine to France.\n\nSome leaders of the Commune, including Delescluze, died on the barricades, but most of the others survived and lived long afterwards, and some of them resumed political careers in France.\n* [[Felix Pyat]], the radical journalist, slipped out of Paris near the end of the Commune and reappeared as a refugee in London. He was sentenced to death ''[[Trial in absentia|in absentia]]'', but he and the other Communards were granted an amnesty. He returned to France, where he again became active in politics. He was elected to the Chamber of Deputies in March 1888, where he sat on the extreme left. He died in 1889.\n* [[Louis Auguste Blanqui]] had been elected the honorary President of the Commune, but he was in prison during its entire duration. He was sentenced to be transported to a penal colony in 1872, but because of his health his sentence was changed to imprisonment. He was elected a Deputy for Bordeaux in April 1879, but was disqualified. After he was released from prison, he continued his career as an agitator. He died after giving a speech in Paris in January 1881. Like Adolphe Thiers, he is buried in [[P\u00e8re Lachaise Cemetery]], where one of the last battles of the Commune was fought.\n* [[Louise Michel]], the famous \"Red Virgin\", was sentenced to transportation to a penal colony in New Caledonia, where she served as a schoolteacher. She was amnestied in 1880, and returned to Paris, where she resumed her career as an activist and anarchist. She was arrested in 1880 for leading a mob which pillaged a bakery, was imprisoned, and then pardoned. She was arrested several more times, and once was freed by the intervention of Georges Clemenceau. She died in 1905, and was buried near her close friend and colleague during the Commune, Th\u00e9ophile Ferr\u00e9, the man who had signed the death warrant for the Archbishop of Paris and other hostages.\n\n===In fiction===\n\n====Poetry====\n* Among the first to write about the Commune was [[Victor Hugo]], whose poem \"Sur une barricade\", written on 11 June 1871, and published in 1872 in a collection of poems under the name ''[[L'Ann\u00e9e terrible|L' Ann\u00e9e terrible]]'', honours the bravery of a twelve-year-old Communard being led to the execution squad.\n* [[William Morris|William Morris']] sequence of poems, \"The Pilgrims of Hope\" (1885), features a climax set in the Commune.<ref>\"In his later years, the story of the Commune so gripped Morris's imagination that it provided the climax for his long poem, \"The Pilgrims of Hope\"...

The Prix Goncourt winning novel is an account of the tumultuous events of 1871 told in free indirect style from the points of view of a policeman and a Communard tied together by the murder of a child and love for an Italian woman called Miss Pecci. The novel begins with the discovery of the corpse of a woman dumped in the Seine and the subsequent investigation in which the two main protagonists, Grondin and Tarpagnan, are involved. The eponymous newspaper, ''Le Cri du Peuple'', is inspired by the actual Communard newspaper edited by [[Jules Vall\u00e8s]]. The book itself is supposedly his account. The painter Gustave Courbet also makes an appearance.\n* In ''[[The Prague Cemetery]]'', Italian author [[Umberto Eco]] sets chapter 17 against the background of the Paris Commune.\n* ''The Queen of the Night'' by Alexander Chee (2016) depicts the survival of fictional opera singer Lilliet Berne during the siege of Paris. The novel's heroine also interacts with several notable figures of the day, including George Sand and the Empress Eug\u00e9nie de Montijo.\n* Several popular British and American novelists of the late 19th century depicted the Commune as a tyranny against which Anglo-Americans and their aristocratic French allies heroically pitted themselves.<ref name=\"ab\">Albert Boime, ''Olin Levi Warner's Defense of the Paris Commune'', Archives of American Art Journal, Vol. 29, No. 3/4 (1989), (pp. 4, 13)</ref> Among the most well-known of these anti-Commune novels are ''Woman of the Commune'' (1895, AKA ''A Girl of the Commune'') by [[G. A. Henty]] and in the same year, ''The Red Republic: A Romance of the Commune'' by [[Robert W. Chambers]].<ref name=\"ab\" />\n* In ''[[Marx Returns]]'' by the British writer and filmmaker [[Jason Barker]], the Commune provides the historical context to Karl Marx's revolutionary struggles, and is depicted \"as a symbol of an unfinished political project.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://politicsslashletters.org/marx-as-flawed-manic-and-one-of-us-a-review-of-marx-returns/|title=Marx as Flawed, Manic, and One of Us: a Review of Marx Returns|date=17 September 2018|publisher=}}</ref>\n\n====Theatre====\n* At least three plays have been set in the Commune: ''Nederlaget'' by [[Nordahl Grieg]], ''[[The Days of the Commune|Die Tage der Commune]]'' by [[Bertolt Brecht]], and ''Le Printemps 71'' by [[Arthur Adamov]].\n* Berlin performance group Showcase Beat le Mot created ''Paris 1871 Bonjour Commune'' (first performed at Hebbel am Ufer in 2010), the final part of a tetralogy dealing with failed revolutions.\n* New York theatre group [[The Civilians]] performed ''[[The Civilians#Paris Commune (2004, 2008)|Paris Commune]]'' in 2004 and 2008.\n\n====Film====\n* There have been numerous films set in the Commune. Particularly notable is ''[[La Commune (Paris, 1871)|La Commune]]'', which runs for 5\u00be hours and was directed by [[Peter Watkins]]. It was made in [[Montreuil, Seine-Saint-Denis|Montreuil]] in 2000, and as with most of Watkins' other films it uses ordinary people instead of actors to create a documentary effect. Some participants were the children of cast members from Watkin's masterpiece Edvard Munch (1974). La Commune was shot on film by Odd-Geir Saether, the Norwegian cameraman from the Munch film.\n* Soviet filmmakers [[Grigori Kozintsev]] and [[Leonid Trauberg]] wrote and directed, in 1929, the silent film ''[[The New Babylon]]'' (''Novyy Vavilon'') about the Paris Commune. It features [[Dmitri Shostakovich]]'s first film score.\n* British filmmaker Ken McMullen has made two films directly or indirectly influenced by the Commune: Ghost Dance (1983)and 1871 (1990). Ghost Dance is furthermore of interest due to the appearance of French philosopher Jacques Derrida.\n\n====Other====\n* The Italian composer [[Luigi Nono (composer)|Luigi Nono]] also wrote the opera ''[[Al gran sole carico d'amore]]'' (''In the Bright Sunshine, Heavy with Love''), which is based on the Paris Commune.\n* Comics artist [[Jacques Tardi]] translated the Vautrin's  novel (listed above) into a comic, which is also called ''Le Cri du Peuple''.\n* In the long-running British TV series ''[[The Onedin Line]]'' (episode 27, screened 10 December 1972), shipowner James Onedin is lured into the Commune in pursuit of a commercial debt and finds himself under heavy fire.\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Anarchism|Communism|Socialism|France}}\n{{columns-list |colwidth=25em |\n* [[Revolt of the Comuneros|Castilian War of the Communities]]\n* [[Commune (model of government)]]\n* [[Gustave Paul Cluseret]]\n* [[Gustave Flourens]]\n* [[Le\u00f3 Frankel]]\n* [[Andr\u00e9 Gill]]\n* [[Paschal Grousset]]\n* [[Paul Lafargue]]\n* [[\u00c9douard Manet]]\n* [[Medieval commune]]\n* [[Nadar (photographer)|Felix Nadar]]\n* [[Eug\u00e8ne Edine Pottier]]\n* [[\u00c9lis\u00e9e Reclus]]\n* [[Arthur Rimbaud]]\n* [[Louis Rossel]]\n* [[Jules Vall\u00e8s]]\n* [[Paul Verlaine]]\n* [[Strandzha Commune]]\n* [[Republic of Tarnobrzeg]]\n* [[Pittsburgh railroad strike of 1877]]\n}}\n\n==References==\n\n===Notes===\n{{Reflist|2}}\n\n===Bibliography===\n{{refbegin}}\n* {{cite book|last=Rougerie|first=Jacques|title=La Commune de 1871|year=2014|publisher=Presses universitaires de France| location=Paris|isbn=978-2-13-062078-5}}\n* {{cite book|last=Rougerie|first=Jacques|title=Paris libre 1871|year=2004|publisher=Editions du Seuil|location=Paris|isbn=2-02-055465-8}}\n* {{cite book|last=Milza |first=Pierre |title= L'ann\u00e9e terrible: La Commune (mars\u2013juin 1871)| year=2009a |publisher=Perrin |location=Paris | isbn=978-2-262-03073-5}}\n* {{cite book| last=Milza | first=Pierre| title= L'ann\u00e9e terrible: La guerre franco-prussienne (septembre 1870 \u2013 mars 1871) | year= 2009b |publisher= Perrin |location=Paris | isbn=978-2-262-02498-7}}\n* {{cite book|last=du Camp|first=Maxime|title=Les Convulsions de Paris|url=https://archive.org/details/lesconvulsionsde03ducauoft|year=1881|publisher=Hachette|location=Paris}}\n* ''The Red Republic, A Romance of The Commune'', Robert W.

Richards was killed when the truck fell 30 metres into the river.\n\n==History==\n\n===Construction===\nThe bridge was built on public land<ref>http://m.nzherald.co.nz/wanganui-chronicle/opinion/news/article.cfm?c_id=1503423&objectid=11257489</ref> in 1986 for Keith and Margaret Berryman, a nearby landowner, by members of the [[New Zealand Army]] and a group of Fijian army trainees, as an exercise. The design was based upon calculations by Lieutenant John Armstrong, with labour and logistics for construction provided at New Zealand army expense. The Berrymans were to provide all materials, but instead of the specified [[Nothofagus macrocarpa|macrocarpa]] or [[Wood preservation|tanalised]] [[radiata pine]] timber for the transoms and bearers, they obtained [[Douglas fir]] timber from a demolition site in Wanganui. Lieutenant Armstrong's initial reaction was not to proceed with construction using deficient materials, but he was eventually persuaded when Keith Berryman signed a statement, witnessed by a neighbouring JP, taking responsibility for the materials and their subsequent inspection and maintenance. Loading was recalculated accordingly.\n\nUntreated Douglas fir timber has featured in the '''[[Leaky homes crisis|leaky homes]]''' saga around New Zealand; it is difficult to treat against decay and untreated timber is suitable for use only where it can be adequately protected from moisture. Te Rata receives about 1800&nbsp;mm (72&nbsp;in) of rainfall per year, and the river gorge is continuously damp with frequent fog.\n\n===Collapse===\nG. W. Butcher, a retired Lieutenant Colonel and [[Civil engineering|civil engineer]], who reported on the collapse for the army, concluded that the failure was caused by \"50% reduction in the nominal strength of the member ... entirely due to decay of the untreated timber.\"  Additional factors were \"the decision to use two 300x75 beams bolted together for the transoms in place of a solid 300x150 member\" and the lack of a \"regular inspection and maintenance programme [...] by the owners of the bridge\".\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:Te Rata detailed.jpg|frame|Bridge in detail|right]] -->\nThe army withheld Butcher's report from the 1997 inquest into Richards' death and kept its contents secret until it was published illegally on the internet by the Berrymans' lawyer, [[Rob Moodie (lawyer)|Rob Moodie]]. The Berrymans claim that their fight against attempts by the [[New Zealand Department of Labour|Occupational Safety and Health department]] to prosecute them for Richards' death has led to bankruptcy and the loss of their farm.\n\nThe complete text of the Butcher report is held at [[Wikisource:Butcher report]]. Its author could not previously comment publicly on its implications, but since its illegal distribution the Army has released the report. George Butcher has now spoken publicly and said Keith Berryman admitted to him that the transoms were in poor condition, that there was visible rot in some timbers, and that he was worried about the state of the bridge. Knowledge of an unsafe work environment and failure to prevent or isolate the risk is an offence in New Zealand, but the prosecution of the Berrymans failed when the judge ruled the bridge did not meet the definition of Mr Richards' place of work in the Health and Safety in Employment Act 1992.<ref>{{Cite journal|url = http://www.nzlii.org/nz/journals/VUWLawRw/1998/20.html|title = Farm Hazards and the Health and Safety in Employment Act|last = Stallard|first = Jaron|date = 1998|journal = Victoria University of Wellington Law Review|access-date = 24 September 2015}}</ref>\n\n== Time line of Te Rata bridges ==\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:Te Rata.jpg|frame|Bridge and House looking upstream|right]] -->\nThe Berryman Bridge was the second suspension bridge to be the primary access to Te Rata. The earlier bridge, which collapsed around the 1980s, was a fearsome structure on the same site. In the 'Otago Born and Bred' articles noted below, this first bridge is referred to as the Hayes Bridge.   The Hayes bridge, said to be 100&nbsp;ft above the water, is understood by the Ruslings, still resident in the valley, to have been built by the Tichner brothers, formerly sailors, around 1915\u20131916. The cables consisted of bunches of 52 strands of No. 8 wire, and endured the whole life of the bridge, a period of at least 66 years. When the bridge finally collapsed under the weight of a mob of sheep, the uprights on the house side gave way, allowing the anchors to fall away. Evan and Bob Hayes, who were moving the sheep, were fortunately not on the bridge when it collapsed, but most of the sheep were either killed from the fall, or drowned in the Retaruke.\n* 1915\u20131916 Original bridge \"Hayes bridge\" constructed.\n* 1986 \u2013 Second bridge constructed.\n* 1994 \u2013 Bridge collapses.\n* 1997 \u2013 Inquest into collapse.\n* 2008, May \u2013 High Court quashes the parts of the 1997 finding by Taumarunui coroner that exonerated the Army, but stops short of exonerating the Berrymans<ref>{{cite web |url = http://www.stuff.co.nz/4505706a11.html|title = Berrymans win court battle|accessdate = 19 September 2008|author = Paul Mulrooney, Anna Chalmers and Kelly Burns|date = 2 May 2008|work = [[The Dominion Post (Wellington)|The Dominion Post]]|publisher = [[stuff.co.nz]]}} {{Cite journal|url = http://www.medialawjournal.co.nz/?p=105|title = A victory for the Berrymans?|last = Price|first = Stephen|date = 6 May 2008|journal = Media Law Journal|access-date = 24 September 2015}}</ref>\n* 2008, June \u2013 Berrymans seek damages from Defence Force at the Court of Appeal<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.stuff.co.nz/stuff/dominionpost/4588573a6000.html |title=Berrymans seek damages from Defence Force |accessdate=19 June 2007 |date= 18 June 2008 |work=[[The Dominion Post (Wellington)|The Dominion Post]] |publisher=[[NZPA]] }}</ref>\n* 2008, 25 September  \u2013 [[Court of Appeal]] decided Berryman's will have their claim of [[misfeasance]] heard.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&objectid=10534250 |title=Defence appeal rejected in bridge collapse case |accessdate=25 September 2008 |date= 25 September 2008 |work=[[The New Zealand Herald]] |publisher=[[NZPA]] }}</ref>\n* 2009, 24 December \u2013 Berrymans accept Government settlement offer of $150,000.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.stuff.co.nz/national/3203173/Berrymans-accept-Govt-compo-offer|title=Berrymans accept Govt compo offer |last=NZPA|date=2 January 2010|publisher=stuff.co.nz|accessdate=2 January 2010}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n*[[Bridges in New Zealand]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://tvnz.co.nz/view/page/410940/541820 TVNZ- Report released over bridge collapse]\n\n{{coord|39|6.78|S|175|5.76|E|region:NZ_type:landmark|display=title}}\n\n[[Category:Suspension bridges in New Zealand]]\n[[Category:Bridges in Manawat\u016b-Whanganui]]\n[[Category:Bridges completed in 1986]]\n[[Category:Bridge disasters in New Zealand]]\n", "text_old": "{{Use dmy dates|date=April 2020}}\n__NOTOC__\n{{Location map\n |New Zealand\n |label=Te Rata Bridge\n |lat_dir=S | lat_deg=39 | lat_min=6.78\n |lon_dir=E | lon_deg=175 | lon_min=5.76\n |position=left\n |width= 180\n |float=right\n |caption=\n}}\n\nThe '''Te Rata Bridge''' was a suspension bridge across the [[Retaruke River]] in the [[King Country]], [[New Zealand]].

Butcher, a retired Lieutenant Colonel and [[Civil engineering|civil engineer]], who reported on the collapse for the army, concluded that the failure was caused by \"50% reduction in the nominal strength of the member ... entirely due to decay of the untreated timber.\"  Additional factors were \"the decision to use two 300x75 beams bolted together for the transoms in place of a solid 300x150 member\" and the lack of a \"regular inspection and maintenance programme [...] by the owners of the bridge\".\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:Te Rata detailed.jpg|frame|Bridge in detail|right]] -->\nThe army withheld Butcher's report from the 1997 inquest into Richards' death and kept its contents secret until it was published illegally on the internet by the Berrymans' lawyer, [[Rob Moodie (lawyer)|Rob Moodie]]. The Berrymans claim that their fight against attempts by the [[New Zealand Department of Labour|Occupational Safety and Health department]] to prosecute them for Richards' death has led to bankruptcy and the loss of their farm.\n\nThe complete text of the Butcher report is held at [[Wikisource:Butcher report]]. Its author could not previously comment publicly on its implications, but since its illegal distribution the Army has released the report. George Butcher has now spoken publicly and said Keith Berryman admitted to him that the transoms were in poor condition, that there was visible rot in some timbers, and that he was worried about the state of the bridge. Knowledge of an unsafe work environment and failure to prevent or isolate the risk is an offence in New Zealand, but the prosecution of the Berrymans failed when the judge ruled the bridge did not meet the definition of Mr Richards' place of work in the Health and Safety in Employment Act 1992.<ref>{{Cite journal|url = http://www.nzlii.org/nz/journals/VUWLawRw/1998/20.html|title = Farm Hazards and the Health and Safety in Employment Act|last = Stallard|first = Jaron|date = 1998|journal = Victoria University of Wellington Law Review|access-date = 24 September 2015}}</ref>\n\n== Time line of Te Rata bridges ==\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:Te Rata.jpg|frame|Bridge and House looking upstream|right]] -->\nThe Berryman Bridge was the second suspension bridge to be the primary access to Te Rata. The earlier bridge, which collapsed around the 1980s, was a fearsome structure on the same site. In the 'Otago Born and Bred' articles noted below, this first bridge is referred to as the Hayes Bridge.   The Hayes bridge, said to be 100&nbsp;ft above the water, is understood by the Ruslings, still resident in the valley, to have been built by the Tichner brothers, formerly sailors, around 1915-1916. The cables consisted of bunches of 52 strands of No. 8 wire, and endured the whole life of the bridge, a period of at least 66 years. When the bridge finally collapsed under the weight of a mob of sheep, the uprights on the house side gave way, allowing the anchors to fall away. Evan and Bob Hayes, who were moving the sheep, were fortunately not on the bridge when it collapsed, but most of the sheep were either killed from the fall, or drowned in the Retaruke.\n* 1915\u20131916 Original bridge \"Hayes bridge\" constructed.\n* 1986 - Second bridge constructed.\n* 1994 - Bridge collapses.\n* 1997 - Inquest into collapse.\n* 2008, May - High Court quashes the parts of the 1997 finding by Taumarunui coroner that exonerated the Army, but stops short of exonerating the Berrymans<ref>{{cite web |url = http://www.stuff.co.nz/4505706a11.html|title = Berrymans win court battle|accessdate = 19 September 2008|author = Paul Mulrooney, Anna Chalmers and Kelly Burns|date = 2 May 2008|work = [[The Dominion Post (Wellington)|The Dominion Post]]|publisher = [[stuff.co.nz]]}} {{Cite journal|url = http://www.medialawjournal.co.nz/?p=105|title = A victory for the Berrymans?|last = Price|first = Stephen|date = 6 May 2008|journal = Media Law Journal|access-date = 24 September 2015}}</ref>\n* 2008, June - Berrymans seek damages from Defence Force at the Court of Appeal<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.stuff.co.nz/stuff/dominionpost/4588573a6000.html |title=Berrymans seek damages from Defence Force |accessdate=19 June 2007 |date= 18 June 2008 |work=[[The Dominion Post (Wellington)|The Dominion Post]] |publisher=[[NZPA]] }}</ref>\n* 2008, 25 September  - [[Court of Appeal]] decided Berryman's will have their claim of [[misfeasance]] heard.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&objectid=10534250 |title=Defence appeal rejected in bridge collapse case |accessdate=25 September 2008 |date= 25 September 2008 |work=[[The New Zealand Herald]] |publisher=[[NZPA]] }}</ref>\n* 2009, 24 December - Berrymans accept Government settlement offer of $150,000.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.stuff.co.nz/national/3203173/Berrymans-accept-Govt-compo-offer|title=Berrymans accept Govt compo offer |last=NZPA|date=2 January 2010|publisher=stuff.co.nz|accessdate=2 January 2010}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n*[[Bridges in New Zealand]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://tvnz.co.nz/view/page/410940/541820 TVNZ- Report released over bridge collapse]\n\n{{coord|39|6.78|S|175|5.76|E|region:NZ_type:landmark|display=title}}\n\n[[Category:Suspension bridges in New Zealand]]\n[[Category:Bridges in Manawat\u016b-Whanganui]]\n[[Category:Bridges completed in 1986]]\n[[Category:Bridge disasters in New Zealand]]\n", "name_user": "Dawnseeker2000", "label": "safe", "comment": "fixeddashesusing ascript", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Te_Rata_Bridge"}
