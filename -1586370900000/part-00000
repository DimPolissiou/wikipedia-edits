In 2012, an eBook version of the second edition was published in ePub, Mobi, and PDF formats.\n\nANSI C, first standardized in 1989 (as ANSI X3.159-1989), has since undergone several revisions, the most recent of which is ISO/IEC 9899:2018 (also termed ''[[C18 (C standard revision)|C18]]''), adopted as an [[ANSI]] standard in June 2018.

Examples generally consist of complete programs of the type one is likely to encounter in daily use of the language, with an emphasis on [[system programming]].  Its authors said:\n\n{{quote|We have tried to retain the brevity of the first edition.  C is not a big language, and it is not well served by a big book.  We have improved the exposition of critical features, such as pointers, that are central to C programming.  We have refined the original examples, and have added new examples in several chapters.  For instance, the treatment of complicated declarations is augmented by programs that convert declarations into words and vice versa.  As before, all examples have been tested directly from the text, which is in machine-readable form.|preface to the second edition<ref name=\"k&r2e\">{{cite book |last1= Kernighan |first1= Brian |author-link1= Brian Kernighan |last2= Ritchie |first2= Dennis M. |author-link2= Dennis Ritchie |title= The C Programming Language |edition= 2nd |publisher= [[Prentice Hall]] |date= March 1988 |location= [[Englewood Cliffs, NJ]] |url= https://archive.org/details/cprogramminglang00bria |isbn= 0-13-110362-8 |url-status=dead |df=  }}</ref>}}\n[[File:Hello World Brian Kernighan 1974.jpg|thumb|\"Hello, World!\" program by Brian Kernighan (1978)]]\nThe book introduced the \"[[\"Hello,_World!\"_program|Hello, World!]]\" program, which prints only the text \"hello, world\", as an illustration of a minimal working C program.  Since then, many texts have followed that convention for introducing a programming language.\n\nBefore the advent of [[ANSI C]], the first edition of the text served as the ''de facto'' standard of the language for writers of C compilers.  With the standardization of ANSI C, the authors more consciously wrote the second edition for programmers rather than compiler writers, saying:\n\n{{quote|Appendix A, the reference manual, is not the standard, but our attempt to convey the essentials of the standard in a smaller space.  It is meant for easy comprehension by programmers, but not as a definition for compiler writers\u2014that role properly belongs to the standard itself.  Appendix B is a summary of the facilities of the standard library.  It too is meant for reference by programmers, not implementers.  Appendix C is a concise summary of the changes from the original version.|preface to the second edition<ref name=\"k&r2e\" />}}\n\nThe influence of ''The C Programming Language'' on programmers, a generation of whom first worked with C in universities and industry, has led many to accept the authors' programming style and conventions as recommended practice, if not normative practice.  For example, the coding and formatting style of the programs presented in both editions of the book is often referred to as \"K&R style\" or the \"[[Indent style#K&R style|One True Brace Style]]\" and became the coding style used by convention in the source code for the [[Unix]] and [[Linux]] [[kernel (computer science)|kernels]].\n\n* ''[[The C++ Programming Language]]''\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\nhttps://www.computerinhindi.info/p/learn-c-proramming-in-hindi.html== External links ==\n* [https://archive.org/details/TheCProgrammingLanguageFirstEdition The C Programming Language], first edition available at the ''[[Internet Archive]]''\n* {{Cite web|url=https://www.learnbix.com/cprogramming/learn-c|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170221011231/https://www.learnbix.com/cprogramming/learn-c|url-status=dead|archive-date=2017-02-21|title=C Programming|last=|first=|date=2004-06-13|website=Bell Labs Computing Sciences Research Center|publisher=|access-date=17 January 2017}}.

The book was central to the development and popularization of the [[C (programming language)|C programming language]] and is still widely read and used today.

The second edition of the book (and as of 2018, the most recent) has since been translated into over 20 languages. In 2012, an eBook version of the second edition was published in ePub, Mobi, and PDF formats.\n\nANSI C, first standardized in 1989 (as ANSI X3.159-1989), has since undergone several revisions, the most recent of which is ISO/IEC 9899:2018 (also termed ''[[C18 (C standard revision)|C18]]''), adopted as an [[ANSI]] standard in June 2018.

Examples generally consist of complete programs of the type one is likely to encounter in daily use of the language, with an emphasis on [[system programming]].  Its authors said:\n\n{{quote|We have tried to retain the brevity of the first edition.  C is not a big language, and it is not well served by a big book.  We have improved the exposition of critical features, such as pointers, that are central to C programming.  We have refined the original examples, and have added new examples in several chapters.  For instance, the treatment of complicated declarations is augmented by programs that convert declarations into words and vice versa.  As before, all examples have been tested directly from the text, which is in machine-readable form.|preface to the second edition<ref name=\"k&r2e\">{{cite book |last1= Kernighan |first1= Brian |author-link1= Brian Kernighan |last2= Ritchie |first2= Dennis M. |author-link2= Dennis Ritchie |title= The C Programming Language |edition= 2nd |publisher= [[Prentice Hall]] |date= March 1988 |location= [[Englewood Cliffs, NJ]] |url= https://archive.org/details/cprogramminglang00bria |isbn= 0-13-110362-8 |url-status=dead |df=  }}</ref>}}\n[[File:Hello World Brian Kernighan 1974.jpg|thumb|\"Hello, World!\" program by Brian Kernighan (1978)]]\nThe book introduced the \"[[\"Hello,_World!\"_program|Hello, World!]]\" program, which prints only the text \"hello, world\", as an illustration of a minimal working C program.  Since then, many texts have followed that convention for introducing a programming language.\n\nBefore the advent of [[ANSI C]], the first edition of the text served as the ''de facto'' standard of the language for writers of C compilers.  With the standardization of ANSI C, the authors more consciously wrote the second edition for programmers rather than compiler writers, saying:\n\n{{quote|Appendix A, the reference manual, is not the standard, but our attempt to convey the essentials of the standard in a smaller space.  It is meant for easy comprehension by programmers, but not as a definition for compiler writers\u2014that role properly belongs to the standard itself.  Appendix B is a summary of the facilities of the standard library.  It too is meant for reference by programmers, not implementers.  Appendix C is a concise summary of the changes from the original version.|preface to the second edition<ref name=\"k&r2e\" />}}\n\nThe influence of ''The C Programming Language'' on programmers, a generation of whom first worked with C in universities and industry, has led many to accept the authors' programming style and conventions as recommended practice, if not normative practice.  For example, the coding and formatting style of the programs presented in both editions of the book is often referred to as \"K&R style\" or the \"[[Indent style#K&R style|One True Brace Style]]\" and became the coding style used by convention in the source code for the [[Unix]] and [[Linux]] [[kernel (computer science)|kernels]].\n\n[https://www.computerinhindi.info/p/learn-c-proramming-in-hindi.html C Programming In Hindi]== See also ==\n* ''[[The C++ Programming Language]]''\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\nhttps://www.computerinhindi.info/p/learn-c-proramming-in-hindi.html== External links ==\n* [https://archive.org/details/TheCProgrammingLanguageFirstEdition The C Programming Language], first edition available at the ''[[Internet Archive]]''\n* {{Cite web|url=https://www.learnbix.com/cprogramming/learn-c|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170221011231/https://www.learnbix.com/cprogramming/learn-c|url-status=dead|archive-date=2017-02-21|title=C Programming|last=|first=|date=2004-06-13|website=Bell Labs Computing Sciences Research Center|publisher=|access-date=17 January 2017}}.
