The song is a mocking portrayal of a white man who likes to act like an African-American stereotype.\n\nThe song appears as the seventh track on their ''[[Greatest Hits (The Offspring album)|Greatest Hits]]'' (2005).\n\n==Composition and lyrics==\nBeginning with a sample of the pseudo-[[German (language)|German]] nonsense phrase \"Gunter glieben glauchen globen\" from [[Def Leppard]]'s song \"[[Rock of Ages (Def Leppard song)|Rock of Ages]]\", chanted as a replacement for the traditional \"1, 2, 3, 4\" to start the recording, the song ridicules a \"[[wigger|wannabe gangsta]]\" who is immersed in [[hip-hop culture]] not because he truly loves or understands it, but because it is trendy, makes him feel tough (\"''Friends say he's tryin' too hard, and he's not quite hip''/''But in his own mind, he's the, he's the dopest trip''\"), and because he believes it attracts women (\"''and all the girlies say I'm pretty fly, for a white guy''\").\n\nAs summed up by [[Dexter Holland]], the people described in the lyrics \"are from, like, [[Omaha, Nebraska]], regular white-bread boys, but who act like they're from [[Compton, California|Compton]]. It's so fake and obvious that they're trying to have an identity.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4wK_Oz2Yz7IC&pg=PA64|title=You Gotta Keep 'Em Alienated|work=Spin|first=Rob|last=Brunner|date=1 December 1998|page=64|via=Google Books}}</ref> Holland detailed that he meets many teenagers like those in his native [[Orange County, California|Orange County]], \"going to the mall, where they buy [[FUBU]], [[Tommy Hilfiger Corporation|Tommy Hilfiger]], and [[Ice Cube]]'s latest record.\"<ref>[http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,274657,00.html Dexter Holland's ''Americana'' Tour]</ref> Given rap culture is the starting point, Holland clarified that it was not an attack on African-Americans, but \"poseurs of any kind\",<ref name=spin/> but without wanting \"to be preachy about it...

The \"white guy\" drives through town in his [[lowrider]] and tries to act cool in front of African-Americans, playing with his car's [[hydraulic system]] and interrupting a [[break dance]] session to dance himself. He is then carried by a group of girls to a pool party and thrown into the pool. He jumps out of the pool and finds some bikini clad dancers in front of him. These scenes are cut with the band playing. The video ends with the \"white guy\" returning home and scaring his little sister, who is wearing a fairy costume, because of his dishevelled appearance.\n\nAccording to [[Dexter Holland]], the band wanted [[Seth Green]] to play the \"white guy\" but he was unavailable. After seeing an audition tape with \"five unknowns\", they settled on Guy Cohen,<ref>{{cite magazine |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nw4EAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA75 |title=The Modern Age |first=Carrie |last=Bell |magazine=Billboard |date=March 20, 1999 |page=75 |via=Google Books}}</ref> who went on to cameo in the \"[[Why Don't You Get a Job?]]\" video and occasionally appear at Offspring concerts.<ref name=spin>{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3R7GZ8ghL8wC&pg=PA88|title=White Punks on Dope|work=Spin|first=Chris|last=Norris|date=1 March 1999|page=88|via=Google Books}}</ref>\n\n==Track listing==\n'''Cassette single and 7\" black vinyl'''\n{{tracklist\n| collapsed       = no\n| title1          = Pretty Fly (For a White Guy)\n| length1         = 3:08\n| title2          = Pretty Fly (For a White Guy) \n| note2           = The Geek mix\n| length2         = 3:01\n}}\n\n'''Initial pressing'''\n{{tracklist\n| collapsed       = no\n| title1          = Pretty Fly (For a White Guy)\n| length1         = 3:08\n| title2          = Pretty Fly (For a White Guy) \n| note2           = The Geek mix\n| length2         = 3:07\n| title3          = [[All I Want (The Offspring song)|All I Want]]\n| note3           = Live\n| length3         = 2:02\n| title4          = Pretty Fly (For a White Guy) \n| note4           = Spanish version\n| length4         = 3:08\n}}\n\n'''Australia CD Maxi'''\n{{tracklist\n| collapsed       = no\n| title1          = Pretty Fly (For a White Guy)\n| length1         = 3:08\n| title2          = Pretty Fly (For a White Guy)\n| note2           = The Geek mix\n| length2         = 3:07\n| title3          = No Brakes\n| length3         = 2:06\n}}\n\n'''Italy 12\" black vinyl'''\n{{tracklist\n| collapsed       = no\n| title1          = Pretty Fly (For a White Guy)\n| length1         = 3:08\n| title2          = Pretty Fly (For a White Guy)\n| note2           = The Geek Mix\n| length2         = 3:07\n| title3          = Pretty Fly (For a White Guy)\n| note3           = The Baka Boys remix\n| length3         = 3:01\n| title4          = All I Want\n| note4           = Live\n| length4         = 2:02\n}}\n\n'''Promo 12\" black vinyl'''\n{{tracklist\n| collapsed       = no\n| title1          = Pretty Fly (For a White Guy)\n| note1           = The Baka Boys [[Low Rider]] remix\n| length1         = \n| title2          = Pretty Fly (For a White Guy)\n| note2           = The Baka Boys remix\n| length2         = 3:01\n| title3          = Pretty Fly (For a White Guy)\n| note3           = Dust Bros Space Echo remix\n| length3         = \n| title4          = Pretty Fly (For a White Guy)\n| note4           = Dust Bros Dust mix\n| length4         = \n}}\n\n'''Promo CD'''\n{{tracklist\n| collapsed       = no\n| title1          = Pretty Fly (For a White Guy)\n| note1           = album version\n| length1         = 3:11\n| title2          = Callout Hook #1\n| length2         = 0:10\n| title3          = Callout Hook #2\n| length3         = 0:05\n}}\n\n===DVD appearances===\nThe music video also appears on the ''[[Complete Music Video Collection]]'' DVD.

It is the fourth track from their fifth studio album ''[[Americana (The Offspring album)|Americana]]'' (1998) and was released as the first single from the album. It achieved significant pop and rock and alternative radio play and popularity, peaking at number 53 on the US [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]], number 5 on the ''Billboard'' [[Mainstream Rock (chart)|Hot Mainstream Rock Tracks]] chart and number 3 on the ''Billboard'' [[Alternative Songs|Modern Rock Tracks]] chart. It was a major success internationally, reaching number one in 10 countries, including Australia, where it stayed at number one for six weeks and was certified quadruple platinum. The song is a mocking portrayal of a white man who likes to act like an African-American stereotype.\n\nThe song appears as the seventh track on their ''[[Greatest Hits (The Offspring album)|Greatest Hits]]'' (2005).\n\n==Composition and lyrics==\nBeginning with a sample of the pseudo-[[German (language)|German]] nonsense phrase \"Gunter glieben glauchen globen\" from [[Def Leppard]]'s song \"[[Rock of Ages (Def Leppard song)|Rock of Ages]]\", chanted as a replacement for the traditional \"1, 2, 3, 4\" to start the recording, the song ridicules a \"[[wigger|wannabe gangsta]]\" who is immersed in [[hip-hop culture]] not because he truly loves or understands it, but because it is trendy, makes him feel tough (\"''Friends say he's tryin' too hard, and he's not quite hip''/''But in his own mind, he's the, he's the dopest trip''\"), and because he believes it attracts women (\"''and all the girlies say I'm pretty fly, for a white guy''\").\n\nAs summed up by [[Dexter Holland]], the people described in the lyrics \"are from, like, [[Omaha, Nebraska]], regular white-bread boys, but who act like they're from [[Compton, California|Compton]]. It's so fake and obvious that they're trying to have an identity.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4wK_Oz2Yz7IC&pg=PA64|title=You Gotta Keep 'Em Alienated|work=Spin|first=Rob|last=Brunner|date=1 December 1998|page=64|via=Google Books}}</ref> Holland detailed that he meets many teenagers like those in his native [[Orange County, California|Orange County]], \"going to the mall, where they buy [[FUBU]], [[Tommy Hilfiger Corporation|Tommy Hilfiger]], and [[Ice Cube]]'s latest record.\"<ref>[http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,274657,00.html Dexter Holland's ''Americana'' Tour]</ref> Given rap culture is the starting point, Holland clarified that it was not an attack on African-Americans, but \"poseurs of any kind\",<ref name=spin/> but without wanting \"to be preachy about it...

The \"white guy\" drives through town in his [[lowrider]] and tries to act cool in front of African-Americans, playing with his car's [[hydraulic system]] and interrupting a [[break dance]] session to dance himself. He is then carried by a group of girls to a pool party and thrown into the pool. He jumps out of the pool and finds some bikini clad dancers in front of him. These scenes are cut with the band playing. The video ends with the \"white guy\" returning home and scaring his little sister, who is wearing a fairy costume, because of his dishevelled appearance.\n\nAccording to [[Dexter Holland]], the band wanted [[Seth Green]] to play the \"white guy\" but he was unavailable. After seeing an audition tape with \"five unknowns\", they settled on Guy Cohen,<ref>{{cite magazine |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nw4EAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA75 |title=The Modern Age |first=Carrie |last=Bell |magazine=Billboard |date=March 20, 1999 |page=75 |via=Google Books}}</ref> who went on to cameo in the \"[[Why Don't You Get a Job?]]\" video and occasionally appear at Offspring concerts.<ref name=spin>{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3R7GZ8ghL8wC&pg=PA88|title=White Punks on Dope|work=Spin|first=Chris|last=Norris|date=1 March 1999|page=88|via=Google Books}}</ref>\n\n==Track listing==\n'''Cassette single and 7\" black vinyl'''\n{{tracklist\n| collapsed       = no\n| title1          = Pretty Fly (For a White Guy)\n| length1         = 3:08\n| title2          = Pretty Fly (For a White Guy) \n| note2           = The Geek mix\n| length2         = 3:01\n}}\n\n'''Initial pressing'''\n{{tracklist\n| collapsed       = no\n| title1          = Pretty Fly (For a White Guy)\n| length1         = 3:08\n| title2          = Pretty Fly (For a White Guy) \n| note2           = The Geek mix\n| length2         = 3:07\n| title3          = [[All I Want (The Offspring song)|All I Want]]\n| note3           = Live\n| length3         = 2:02\n| title4          = Pretty Fly (For a White Guy) \n| note4           = Spanish version\n| length4         = 3:08\n}}\n\n'''Australia CD Maxi'''\n{{tracklist\n| collapsed       = no\n| title1          = Pretty Fly (For a White Guy)\n| length1         = 3:08\n| title2          = Pretty Fly (For a White Guy)\n| note2           = The Geek mix\n| length2         = 3:07\n| title3          = No Brakes\n| length3         = 2:06\n}}\n\n'''Italy 12\" black vinyl'''\n{{tracklist\n| collapsed       = no\n| title1          = Pretty Fly (For a White Guy)\n| length1         = 3:08\n| title2          = Pretty Fly (For a White Guy)\n| note2           = The Geek Mix\n| length2         = 3:07\n| title3          = Pretty Fly (For a White Guy)\n| note3           = The Baka Boys remix\n| length3         = 3:01\n| title4          = All I Want\n| note4           = Live\n| length4         = 2:02\n}}\n\n'''Promo 12\" black vinyl'''\n{{tracklist\n| collapsed       = no\n| title1          = Pretty Fly (For a White Guy)\n| note1           = The Baka Boys [[Low Rider]] remix\n| length1         = \n| title2          = Pretty Fly (For a White Guy)\n| note2           = The Baka Boys remix\n| length2         = 3:01\n| title3          = Pretty Fly (For a White Guy)\n| note3           = Dust Bros Space Echo remix\n| length3         = \n| title4          = Pretty Fly (For a White Guy)\n| note4           = Dust Bros Dust mix\n| length4         = \n}}\n\n'''Promo CD'''\n{{tracklist\n| collapsed       = no\n| title1          = Pretty Fly (For a White Guy)\n| note1           = album version\n| length1         = 3:11\n| title2          = Callout Hook #1\n| length2         = 0:10\n| title3          = Callout Hook #2\n| length3         = 0:05\n}}\n\n===DVD appearances===\nThe music video also appears on the ''[[Complete Music Video Collection]]'' DVD.

Previously the private duck shooting preserve of the Maharaja of Bharatpur since the 1850s, the area was designated as a bird sanctuary on 13 March 1976 and a [[Ramsar Site|Ramsar site]] under the Wetland Convention in October 1981.<ref name=\"Ramsar Site\">[http://www.ramsar.org/cda/en/ramsar-documents-list/main/ramsar/1-31-218_4000_0__ Ramsar Convention Listed Sites] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130409081737/http://www.ramsar.org/cda/en/ramsar-documents-list/main/ramsar/1-31-218_4000_0__ |date= 9 April 2013 }}, List of Site.</ref> \n\nThe last big shoot was held in 1964 but the Maharajah retained shooting rights until 1972. In 1985, the Park was declared a [[World Heritage Site]] under the World Heritage Convention. It is a reserve forest under the Rajasthan Forest Act, 1953 and therefore, is the property of the State of Rajasthan of the Indian Union. In 1982, grazing was banned in the park, leading to violent clashes between local farmers and the government.\n\n==Geography==\n[[File:Great Egret at Keoladeo Ghana National Park, Bharatpur, India.jpg|thumb|right|[[Great egret]] at Keoladeo Ghana National Park, Bharatpur, India]]\n[[File:Eurasian spoonbill.JPG|thumb|Eurasian spoonbill]]\n[[File:Knob-billed Duck, Bharatpur.jpg|thumb|[[Knob-billed duck]] alongside [[Eurasian coot]]]]\n\nKeoladeo (Bharatpur) National Park (27\u00b010'N, 77\u00b031'E) is a World Heritage Site situated in eastern [[Rajasthan]]. The park is 2 kilometers (km) south-east of Bharatpur and 55&nbsp;km west of Agra. The Park is spread over approx 29 square kilometer area. One third of the Keoladeo National Park habitat is wetland systems with varying types of microhabitats having trees, mounds, dykes and open water with or without submerged or emergent plants. The uplands have grasslands (savannas) of tall species of grass together with scattered trees and shrubs present in varying density.<ref name=\"Ramsar Site\"/>\n\nA similar habitat with short grasses, such as'' [[Cynodon dactylon]]'' and ''[[Dichanthium annulatum]]'' also exists. Woodlands with thickets of huge Kadam trees (''[[Neolamarckia cadamba]]'') are distributed in scattered pockets. Richness and diversity of plant life inside the Park is remarkable. The Park\u2019s flora consists of 379 species of flowering plants of which 96 are wetland species. The Wetland is a part of the Indo-Gangetic Great Plains.<ref name=\"Ramsar Site\"/>\n\nIn an area characterized by sparse vegetation, the park is the only spot which has dense vegetation and trees. The principal vegetation types are tropical dry deciduous forests intermixed with dry grasslands. Where the forest has degraded, the greater part of the area is covered with shrubs and medium-sized trees. The park is a freshwater swamp and is flooded during the monsoon. The rest of the area remains dry.<ref name=\"Ramsar Site\"/>\nWater remains only in some depressions. This alternate wetting and drying helps to maintain the ecology of the freshwater swamp, ideal for water-fowl and resident water birds. Arrangement to pump water from deep tube wells to fill small depressions to save seeds, spores and other aquatic life also exist. They are also helpful in extreme years of drought.<ref name=\"Ramsar Site2\">[http://www.ramsar.org/cda/en/ramsar-pubs-annolist-annotated-ramsar-16561/main/ramsar/1-30-168%5E16561_4000_0__ Site Description], Ramsar Site no. 230.</ref>\n\n==Climate==\n[[File:Family Breakfast.jpg|thumb|Group of painted storks in one of the wetland habitation in Keoladeo National Park, located in Bharatpur district of Rajasthan, India]]\nDuring 1988, mean maximum temperature ranged from 20.9\u00b0 Celsius (C) in January to 47.8&nbsp;\u00b0C in May, while the mean temperature varied from 6.8&nbsp;\u00b0C in December to 26.5&nbsp;\u00b0C in June. The diurnal temperature variation ranged from 5&nbsp;\u00b0C in January to 50&nbsp;\u00b0C in May. Mean relatively humidity varied from 62% in March to 83.3% in December. The mean annual precipitation is 662 millimeters (mm), with rain falling on an average of 36 days per year. During 1988 only 395mm of rain fell during 32 wet days.<ref name=\"Fieldwork\"/>\n\nLocal observers have noted the shrinking of habitat for aquatic plant species in the Keoladeo National Park in Bharatpur, Rajasthan, northern India, after a number of years of drought and upstream water abstraction. The Keoladeo Naturalists Society invited U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) research ecologist Beth Middleton to visit the park to make observations of aquatic species of concern (Technical Assistance Agreement T-09-763b). The Keoladeo Naturalists Society (a.k.a. \"The Barefoot Naturalists\") is a group of local nature guides and rickshaw pullers. Middleton is a researcher who studies the impact of climate change, drought, and hurricanes on coastal wetlands; because of this expertise, she was asked to look at the impact of droughts on the Keoladeo National Park wetlands. Middleton did her Ph.D. research in India 20 years previously, so she was familiar with the park under conditions of more normal flooding. Upon her return in April 2009, the park looked very different after several years of drought. The aquatic areas of the park appeared to be smaller than during the 1980s; however, at least one positive observation is that park managers have enlisted local villagers to remove the invasive mesquite plant, ''[[Prosopis juliflora]]'', within upland savanna habitats.<ref name=\"Fieldwork\">[http://soundwaves.usgs.gov/2009/08/fieldwork3.html Shrinking Biodiversity], Impact of Falling monsoon in Keoladeo National park.</ref>\n\n==Biology==\n\n===Flora===\nA semi-arid biotype, the park is the only area with significant vegetation, hence the term 'Ghana' meaning 'thicket'. The principal vegetation types are tropical dry deciduous forest, intermixed with dry grassland in areas where forest has been degraded. Apart from the artificially managed marshes; much of the area is covered by medium-sized trees and shrubs.\n\n[[Forest]]s, mostly in the north-east of the park, are dominated by kalam or kadam (''[[Mitragyna parvifolia]]''), jamun (''[[Syzygium cumini]]'') and babul (''[[Acacia nilotica]]''). The open woodland is mostly babul with a small amount of kandi (''[[Prosopis cineraria]]'') and ber (''[[Zizyphus]]'').\n\n[[Scrubland]]s are dominated by ber and kair. It is unlikely that the site would support such numbers of waterfowl as it does without the addition of water from Ajan Bund, a man-made impoundment. Soils are predominantly alluvial \u2013 some clay has formed as a result of the periodic inundations. The mean annual precipitation is 662mm, with rain falling on an average of 36 days per year.\n\nThe open [[woodland]] is mostly babul with a small amount of kandi and ber.

They are food for many fish and birds, as well as some animal species, and hence, constitute a major link in the food chain and functioning of the ecosystem. Land insects are in abundance and have a positive effect on the breeding of land birds.\n\nKeoladeo National Park is known as a \u201cbird paradise\u201d, since more than 370 bird species have been recorded in the park. Ornithologically, the park assumes significance in two respects: One because of its strategic location as a staging ground for [[migratory waterfowl]] arriving in the Indian subcontinent before dispersing to various regions. Further waterfowl converge here before departing to breeding grounds in the western [[Palearctic]] region. In addition, the wetland is a wintering area for massive congregations of waterfowl. It is also the only regular wintering area in India for the [[critically endangered]] [[Siberian crane]].<ref name=\"Biology\" />\n\n====Birds====\n[[File:Darter at Sunset.JPG|thumb|Darter at sunset]]\n[[File:Indian Saras crane01.JPG|thumb|Indian Saurus crane]]\n[[File:Oriental magpie-robin in Bharatpur National Park.jpg|thumb|[[Oriental magpie-robin]] in Keoladeo National Park]]\nThe park's location in the [[Gangetic Plain]] makes it an unrivalled breeding site for [[heron]]s, [[stork]]s and [[cormorant]]s, and an important wintering ground for large numbers of migrant [[duck]]s. The most common waterfowl are [[gadwall]], [[shoveler]], [[common teal]], [[cotton teal]], [[tufted duck]], [[knob-billed duck]], [[little cormorant]], [[great cormorant]], [[Indian shag]], [[ruff]], [[painted stork]], [[white spoonbill]], [[Asian open-billed stork]], [[oriental ibis]], [[darter]], [[common sandpiper]], [[wood sandpiper]] and [[green sandpiper]]. The [[sarus crane]], with its spectacular courtship dance, is also found here.<ref name=\"Biology\" />\n\nBirds present include [[warblers]], [[Old World babbler|babbler]]s, [[bee-eater]]s, [[bulbul]]s, [[bunting (bird)|bunting]]s, [[chat (bird)|chats]], [[Painted francolin]]s and [[quail]]s, [[Indian grey hornbill]] and [[Marshall's iora]]. Raptors include [[osprey]], [[peregrine falcon]], [[Pallas' sea eagle]], [[short-toed eagle]], [[tawny eagle]], [[imperial eagle]], [[spotted eagle]] and [[crested serpent eagle]]. The [[greater spotted eagle]] has recently been recorded breeding here, a new breeding record for the species in India.<ref name=\"Biology\" />\n\n====Mammals====\n[[File:Sambhars are common sight at Keoladeo Ghana National Park Bharatpur India.jpg|thumb|[[Sambar (deer)|Sambar]] are a common sight at Keoladeo Ghana National Park.]]\n[[File:Neel gai 02.jpg|thumb|A nilgai inside Keoladeo National Park]]\nMammalian fauna of Keoladeo National Park is equally rich with 27 identified species.<ref name=\"Biology\" /> [[Nilgai]], feral [[cattle]], and [[chital deer]] are common while [[Sambar (deer)|sambar]] are few. [[Wild boar]] and [[Indian porcupine]] are often spotted sneaking out of the Park to raid crop fields. Two [[mongoose]] species, the [[small Indian mongoose]] and the common [[Indian gray mongoose]], are occasionally found. [[Felidae|Cat]] species present include the [[jungle cat]] and the [[fishing cat]]. The [[Asian palm civet]] and the [[small Indian civet]] are also present, but rarely sighted. The [[smooth-coated otter]] can be seen attacking birds such as [[coot]]s and at times crossing the woodlands. [[Golden Jackal]]s and [[Striped hyena]]s are also sighted and have taken up the role of predators and feed on birds and rodents. Many species of [[rat]]s, [[mice]], [[gerbil]]s and [[bat]]s are also found in the park.<ref name=\"PC Report\" />\nPrimates include the [[rhesus macaque]] and [[Hanuman langur]]s. Large predators are absent, [[leopard]]s having been deliberately exterminated by 1964, but small carnivores include [[Bengal fox]], jackal, [[striped hyena]], [[Paradoxurus hermaphroditus|common palm civet]], [[small Indian civet]], Indian grey mongoose (''[[Herpestes edwardsi]]''), [[fishing cat]], [[leopard cat]], [[jungle cat]] and [[smooth-coated otter]]. Ungulates include [[blackbuck]], [[chital]], [[Sambar (deer)|sambar]], [[hog deer]], [[nilgai]] and [[wild boar]] and feral cattle.<ref name=\"Biology\" />\n\n====Other species====\nFish fauna of the park comprises 43 species, of which 37 enter the park along with the water from Ajan Bund, and six species are breeding residents. During a good rainy season the park receives around 65 million fish fry and fingerlings. The fish population and diversity are of high ecological importance as they form the food source of many birds.\n\nThe [[herpetofauna]] of Keoladeo National Park is diverse. Out of the ten species of turtles that are seen in Rajasthan, seven are present in this park. Besides this, there are five lizard species, thirteen snake species and seven species of amphibians.  The [[Hoplobatrachus crassus|bullfrog]] and [[skipper frog]] are commonly found in the wetlands.  It is often easy to see a [[Pythonidae|python]] out of its burrow and basking in the sun on a sunny winter day.  The common [[monitor lizard]], [[Indian porcupine]] and [[Hipposideros bicolor|bi-colored leaf-nose bat]] have been seen in the same burrow as that of the python. The venomous snakes found in the park are [[krait]], [[cobra]] and [[Russell\u2019s viper]].<ref name=\"Biology\" />\n\n==World Heritage Site==\n[[File:Eurasian spoonbill01.jpg|thumb|Eurasian spoonbill]]\nTo be included on the World Heritage List, sites must be of outstanding universal value and meet at least one out of ten selection criteria. These criteria are explained in the Operational Guidelines for the Implementation of the World Heritage Convention which, besides the text of the Convention, is the main working tool on World Heritage. The criteria are regularly revised by the Committee to reflect the evolution of the World Heritage concept itself.  The UNESCO convention for listing goes on to explain the criteria the selection of Keoladeo Ghana National Park as a '''World Heritage Site under the Natural Criteria iv of Operational Guidelines 2002''' and the description which follows is that the park is a \u201cHabitat of rare and endangered species. The park is a wetland of international importance for migratory waterfowl. It is the wintering ground for the rare Siberian crane and habitat for large numbers of resident nesting birds.\u201d According to the revised '''Operational Guidelines of 2005''', the park falls under '''Criteria (x)''' which states that to be conferred the status of World Heritage, the site should \u201ccontain the most important and significant natural habitats for in-site conservation of biological diversity, including those containing threatened species of outstanding universal value from the point of view of science or conservation.\u201d<ref name=\"heritage site\" />\n\n==Management==\n\n===Issues===\nThe management objective is to allow the area to flood and dry out annually, rather than be maintained as a system of permanent marshes. Water for the wetlands is supplied from the dam outside the park boundaries. Usually, some 14.17 million cubic meters of water is the estimated annual requirement of the park. The water level inside the park is regulated by means of dykes and artificial embankments. The alternative arrangement of water in case of emergencies such as danger of marshes and water bodies drying out completely is ensured through four boreholes so that survival of the aquatic flora and fauna is not endangered before the arrival of monsoon. The boundaries of the park are clearly delineated by a thirty-two Kilometer long boundary encircling the park restricting the encroachment of humans and domestic cattle inside the perimeters of the park. The road from Bharatpur town which used to intersect the park was also closed and relocated outside the boundary to reduce the disturbance by visitors from the town which helped in bringing down the levels of pollution inside the park considerably. As opposed to most of the national parks in India and elsewhere, Bharatpur Bird sanctuary has no buffer zone. Due to the heavy density of population and more than 15 villages settled on the periphery of park, it was impossible for authorities to create a buffer zone around the bird sanctuary. Grazing and collection of firewood and grass was phased out from the park as far back as 1983.\n\n===Constraints===\nThe [[Siberian crane]], which formerly lived throughout the entire Indo-Gangetic plains of India, is reported to be no longer found in the area. Its absence has been attributed to hunting by nomadic tribes along the species' 5,000 mile migration route from Siberia to Bharatpur.\n\nSome 2,500 cattle and domestic [[water buffalo]] were allowed in the area up until November 1982 when grazing was banned. Predictably, the ban led to a buildup of local resentment, resulting in an attempted forced entry into the park. Police opened fire and eight people were killed: tensions still remain high.<ref>Lewis, M. 2003. ''Cattle and Conservation at Bharatpur: A case study in science and advocacy''. Conservation and Society 1: 1\u201321.</ref> The absence of grazing is causing management problems as vegetation, principally Paspalum distichum, a perennial amphibious grass, blocks up the channels. The Rajasthan government has rejected a proposal from the Bombay Natural History Society to allow limited grazing, since this would conflict with the law. Furthermore, recycled nutrients from the large quantity of dung deposited by livestock probably supported considerable numbers of insects.<ref name=\"PC Report\" />\n\nThe presence of some 700 feral cattle within the park is cause for concern as they compete with wildlife for valuable forage. [[Larva]]e of the [[Lepidoptera]]n ''[[Parapoynx diminutalis]]'' has also been a serious pest, and considerably inhibited the growth of ''[[Nymphoides cristatum]]'' during June\u2013July 1986. High levels of pollutants in Ajan Bund are believed to be responsible for the increasing number of piscivorous birds seen in a dazed state and unable to fly. Fewer birds were recorded in 1984 than in previous years. Four [[sarus crane]]s and 40 [[ring-necked dove]]s were found dead outside the park during 1988 and early 1989, possibly due to [[pesticide poisoning]], and a study of the impact of pesticide use in surrounding areas on the park has been initiated in addition to studies on heavy metal contamination. Disturbance from visitors can be a cause for concern, especially during December and January when visitors come to see the cranes.<ref name=\"research facilities\" />\n\nA non-native water hyacinth Icornia species was introduced in 1961, and has now proliferated to the extent that it is blocking the artificial waterways and filling the impoundments. This is significantly altering the habitat for many bird species, and is a serious management problem. Attempts to control the species have been ineffectual to date.\n\n==Tourism and visitor facilities==\nBy virtue of being one of the best bird watching sites of Asia, more than 100,000 visitors come to the park every year. The range of visitors varies from very serious birdwatchers to school children. Of the visitors, 45,000 are foreign tourists. In addition, the location of the park is such that tourists visiting Agra, Fatehpur Sikri and Jaipur invariably stop over at Bharatpur. The park opens from sunrise to sunset around the year. Food and accommodation facilities are available within the precincts of the park. The only accommodation inside the Keoladeo National Park is available in the property of government Bharatpur Ashoka Forest Lodge and lesser expensive Shanti Kutir, which is maintained and run by the ITDC. Bharatpur Forest Lodge is a quaint hotel in the vicinity of natural treasure trove of the park and has a total of 16 rooms to offer to visitors. Its circuit house and [[dak bungalow]] also offer good accommodation options.{{citation needed|date=November 2015}} Visitors coming to Bharatpur can also stay in palaces, havelis and other heritage properties converted into hotels. It is always advisable to have one\u2019s accommodation pre-booked, especially so during winters. An array of 3 star hotels and resorts are also located in the vicinity of the park where visitors can stay cozily.<ref name=\"Tourism\">[http://rajasthanwildlife.rajasthan.gov.in/wild-life/KeoladeoGhanaNationalPark.htm Tourism in Keoladeo National Park] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110215101142/http://www.rajasthanwildlife.rajasthan.gov.in/wild-life/KeoladeoGhanaNationalPark.htm |date=15 February 2011 }}, Visitor facilities in Park.</ref>Besides the normal tourism activities and self-arranged bird watching tours of the Keoladeo National Park, visitors can also opt for a tour of this birding destination by selecting from an array of luxury tourist train services.

The society has recently intensified its operations and has established a hydro-biological station to monitor the ecology of the wetland. Particular attention will be given to any in dramatic change in the vegetation following the ban on grazing. Limnological studies have been carried out by the Zoology Department of the University of Rajasthan, Jaipur. The park authorities are monitoring the bird populations. A documentary film 'Indian birds of the monsoon' was produced by S. and B. Breeden in 1979\u20131980. The park has considerable potential for education, more so than other wetland sites in India, in view of it being relatively near to the cities of Agra, Delhi and Jaipur.\n\nBetween December 1992 and January 1995, a collaborative project between the Governments of India and Russia, International Crane Foundation and Wild Bird Society of Japan was set up to save the Siberian crane. The project focused on releasing captivity bred cranes into the wild, tracking migratory routes of common cranes, and building up the resident crane population in the park. Although the project did not yield the desired results, the successful survival of introduced cranes in the park has given sufficient hope to develop a viable resident population in the future.<ref name=\"research facilities\">[http://www.eoearth.org/article/Keoladeo_(Bharatpur)_National_Park,_India#gen6 Research and Field study initiatives], Scientific research at Keoladeo.</ref>\n\n==Crises of 2007==\n\nA proposal for water supply to Keoladeo National Park, Bharatpur was forwarded by the Government of Rajasthan seeking assistance from Planning Commission as advised and approved by the Ministry of Environment and Forests. Keeping in view the uniqueness of the ecosystem and the capacity to attract a variety of migratory birds the project was thought to be approved in principal with the caveat that the cost be firmed up after a visit to the site by an expert team. The park is in danger of being removed as a Ramsar Site as well as UNESCO World Heritage Site, due to severe drought and abandoning of the park midway by nesting birds in the year 2007.<ref name=\"Drought\">[http://www.thebagh.com/Bharatpur%20Springs%20back%20to%20life.pdf Link text], Drought at Keoladeo National Park.</ref>\n\nA proposal for water supply to Keoladeo National Park, Bharatpur was forwarded by the Government of Rajasthan seeking assistance from Planning Commission as advised and approved by the Ministry of Environment and Forests (MoEF) vide their letter dated 10.04.2008.  As per the MoEF, the proposal is beyond the purview of the existing centrally sponsored scheme of the MoEF, seems to be viable and has the potential to put an end to the eternal [[water scarcity in India|water scarcity]] in Bharatpur National Park.\n\nThe Keoladeo National Park (KNP) is a Ramsar Wetland Site and a [[World Heritage site]].  Due to acute water scarcity, the ecosystem of the Park has been affected badly and this has resulted in reduction in the arrival of migratory birds in the National Park. Water supply is essential for the National Park, which is a wetland and a Ramsar site facing acute shortage of water for the last few years.  Currently, apart from rainfall the Park receives water from \u201cAjan Bund\u201d, a temporary reservoir via the Dakan canal.  Through a small canal dug last year water from Khokhar Weir (Bees Mora) is also available. The total requirement of water for the Park is estimated at about 14.17 million cubic meters (500 MCft).  The supply from Ajan Bund is irregular and subject to the bund being full to the extent of reservoir level at 8.5 meters. During the last several years either water is not supplied or supplied insufficiently.<ref name=\"PC Report\" />\n\nThe project had been prepared to keep in view the need for 400 MCFT of water during late July to August, for a period of 30 days to the Park which is to be had by diverting and lifting flood waters of Yamuna.  The project thus covered diversion of water during monsoon through underground pipes with lifting arrangements over a length of 16&nbsp;km from the off-take point of Goverdhan drain near Santruk village.  The estimated cost of the project as proposed by the State Government was to the tune of Rs. 650 million. The project proposed was to channelize water from Govardhan drain to meet the water deficit of KNP during the months of July to September at the time of requirement.  The major components of the project were construction of a head regulator with control gate at the drain located in the state, raw water reservoir with capacity of 13,000 m, 3 pump houses, DG sets for pumping station and laying and testing of /PCC/MS pipelines.<ref name=\"PC Report\" />\n\n==See also==\n* [[Arid Forest Research Institute]] (AFRI)\n* [[Kanwar Lake Bird Sanctuary|Kanwar Taal Bird Sanctuary]]\n* [[Sultanpur National Park|Sultanpur Bird Sanctuary]]\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{commons category|Keoladeo National Park}}\n*{{webarchive |url=http://webarchive.loc.gov/all/20021009114606/http%3A//www.wcmc.org.uk/protected_areas/data/wh/keoladeo.html |title=WCMC |date=2002-10-09}}\n*Reuters: [https://web.archive.org/web/20071223122111/http://today.reuters.com/News/CrisesArticle.aspx?storyId=DEL95384 Drought-ridden Indian bird park loses its birds].

The sanctuary is one of the richest bird areas in the world and is known for nesting of resident birds and visiting migratory birds including water birds. The rare Siberian cranes used to winter in this park but this central population is now extinct. According to founder of the World Wildlife Fund [[Sir Peter Scott|Peter Scott]], Keoladeo National Park is one of the world\u2019s best bird areas.{{citation needed|date=July 2018}}\n\n==History==\n{{Unreferenced section|date=October 2017}}\n[[File:Painted stork.JPG|thumb|left|[[Painted stork]] at Keoladeo National Park]]\nThe sanctuary was created 250&nbsp;years ago and is named after a Keoladeo (Shiva) temple within its boundaries. Initially, it was a natural depression; and was flooded after the ''Ajan Bund'' was constructed by [[Maharaja Suraj Mal]], then the ruler of the princely state of [[Bharatpur, India|Bharatpur]], between 1726\u20131763. The [[Bunding|bund]] was created at the confluence of two rivers, the [[Gambhir]] and [[Banganga]]. The park was a hunting ground for the Maharajas of Bharatpur, a tradition dating back to 1850, and duck shoots were organised yearly in honour of the [[Viceroy of India|British viceroys]]. In one shoot alone in 1938, over 4,273 birds such as [[mallard]]s and [[teal]]s were killed by [[Victor Hope, 2nd Marquess of Linlithgow|Lord Linlithgow]], then [[Viceroy of India]].{{citation needed|date=April 2011}}\n\nThe park was established as a national park on 10 March 1982. Previously the private duck shooting preserve of the Maharaja of Bharatpur since the 1850s, the area was designated as a bird sanctuary on 13 March 1976 and a [[Ramsar Site|Ramsar site]] under the Wetland Convention in October 1981.<ref name=\"Ramsar Site\">[http://www.ramsar.org/cda/en/ramsar-documents-list/main/ramsar/1-31-218_4000_0__ Ramsar Convention Listed Sites] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130409081737/http://www.ramsar.org/cda/en/ramsar-documents-list/main/ramsar/1-31-218_4000_0__ |date= 9 April 2013 }}, List of Site.</ref> \n\nThe last big shoot was held in 1964 but the Maharajah retained shooting rights until 1972. In 1985, the Park was declared a [[World Heritage Site]] under the World Heritage Convention. It is a reserve forest under the Rajasthan Forest Act, 1953 and therefore, is the property of the State of Rajasthan of the Indian Union. In 1982, grazing was banned in the park, leading to violent clashes between local farmers and the government.\n\n==Geography==\n[[File:Great Egret at Keoladeo Ghana National Park, Bharatpur, India.jpg|thumb|right|[[Great egret]] at Keoladeo Ghana National Park, Bharatpur, India]]\n[[File:Eurasian spoonbill.JPG|thumb|Eurasian spoonbill]]\n[[File:Knob-billed Duck, Bharatpur.jpg|thumb|[[Knob-billed duck]] alongside [[Eurasian coot]]]]\n\nKeoladeo (Bharatpur) National Park (27\u00b010'N, 77\u00b031'E) is a World Heritage Site situated in eastern [[Rajasthan]]. The park is 2 kilometers (km) south-east of Bharatpur and 55&nbsp;km west of Agra. The Park is spread over approx 29 square kilometer area. One third of the Keoladeo National Park habitat is wetland systems with varying types of microhabitats having trees, mounds, dykes and open water with or without submerged or emergent plants. The uplands have grasslands (savannas) of tall species of grass together with scattered trees and shrubs present in varying density.<ref name=\"Ramsar Site\"/>\n\nA similar habitat with short grasses, such as'' [[Cynodon dactylon]]'' and ''[[Dichanthium annulatum]]'' also exists. Woodlands with thickets of huge Kadam trees (''[[Neolamarckia cadamba]]'') are distributed in scattered pockets. Richness and diversity of plant life inside the Park is remarkable. The Park\u2019s flora consists of 379 species of flowering plants of which 96 are wetland species. The Wetland is a part of the Indo-Gangetic Great Plains.<ref name=\"Ramsar Site\"/>\n\nIn an area characterized by sparse vegetation, the park is the only spot which has dense vegetation and trees. The principal vegetation types are tropical dry deciduous forests intermixed with dry grasslands. Where the forest has degraded, the greater part of the area is covered with shrubs and medium-sized trees. The park is a freshwater swamp and is flooded during the monsoon. The rest of the area remains dry.<ref name=\"Ramsar Site\"/>\nWater remains only in some depressions. This alternate wetting and drying helps to maintain the ecology of the freshwater swamp, ideal for water-fowl and resident water birds. Arrangement to pump water from deep tube wells to fill small depressions to save seeds, spores and other aquatic life also exist. They are also helpful in extreme years of drought.<ref name=\"Ramsar Site2\">[http://www.ramsar.org/cda/en/ramsar-pubs-annolist-annotated-ramsar-16561/main/ramsar/1-30-168%5E16561_4000_0__ Site Description], Ramsar Site no. 230.</ref>\n\n==Climate==\n[[File:Family Breakfast.jpg|thumb|Group of painted storks in one of the wetland habitation in Keoladeo National Park, located in Bharatpur district of Rajasthan, India]]\nDuring 1988, mean maximum temperature ranged from 20.9\u00b0 Celsius (C) in January to 47.8&nbsp;\u00b0C in May, while the mean temperature varied from 6.8&nbsp;\u00b0C in December to 26.5&nbsp;\u00b0C in June. The diurnal temperature variation ranged from 5&nbsp;\u00b0C in January to 50&nbsp;\u00b0C in May. Mean relatively humidity varied from 62% in March to 83.3% in December. The mean annual precipitation is 662 millimeters (mm), with rain falling on an average of 36 days per year. During 1988 only 395mm of rain fell during 32 wet days.<ref name=\"Fieldwork\"/>\n\nLocal observers have noted the shrinking of habitat for aquatic plant species in the Keoladeo National Park in Bharatpur, Rajasthan, northern India, after a number of years of drought and upstream water abstraction. The Keoladeo Naturalists Society invited U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) research ecologist Beth Middleton to visit the park to make observations of aquatic species of concern (Technical Assistance Agreement T-09-763b). The Keoladeo Naturalists Society (a.k.a. \"The Barefoot Naturalists\") is a group of local nature guides and rickshaw pullers. Middleton is a researcher who studies the impact of climate change, drought, and hurricanes on coastal wetlands; because of this expertise, she was asked to look at the impact of droughts on the Keoladeo National Park wetlands. Middleton did her Ph.D. research in India 20 years previously, so she was familiar with the park under conditions of more normal flooding. Upon her return in April 2009, the park looked very different after several years of drought. The aquatic areas of the park appeared to be smaller than during the 1980s; however, at least one positive observation is that park managers have enlisted local villagers to remove the invasive mesquite plant, ''[[Prosopis juliflora]]'', within upland savanna habitats.<ref name=\"Fieldwork\">[http://soundwaves.usgs.gov/2009/08/fieldwork3.html Shrinking Biodiversity], Impact of Falling monsoon in Keoladeo National park.</ref>\n\n==Biology==\n\n===Flora===\nA semi-arid biotype, the park is the only area with significant vegetation, hence the term 'Ghana' meaning 'thicket'. The principal vegetation types are tropical dry deciduous forest, intermixed with dry grassland in areas where forest has been degraded. Apart from the artificially managed marshes; much of the area is covered by medium-sized trees and shrubs.\n\n[[Forest]]s, mostly in the north-east of the park, are dominated by kalam or kadam (''[[Mitragyna parvifolia]]''), jamun (''[[Syzygium cumini]]'') and babul (''[[Acacia nilotica]]''). The open woodland is mostly babul with a small amount of kandi (''[[Prosopis cineraria]]'') and ber (''[[Zizyphus]]'').\n\n[[Scrubland]]s are dominated by ber and kair. It is unlikely that the site would support such numbers of waterfowl as it does without the addition of water from Ajan Bund, a man-made impoundment. Soils are predominantly alluvial \u2013 some clay has formed as a result of the periodic inundations. The mean annual precipitation is 662mm, with rain falling on an average of 36 days per year.\n\nThe open [[woodland]] is mostly babul with a small amount of kandi and ber. Scrublands are dominated by ber and kair (''[[Capparis decidua]]'').<ref name=\"Fauna\">[http://pubs.usgs.gov/sir/2009/5193/pdf/SIR2009-5193.pdf Vegetation in Keoladeo National Park].</ref>\n\nPiloo (''[[Salvadora oleoides]]'' and ''[[Salvadora persica]]'') also present in the park and happens to be virtually the only woody plants found in areas of saline soil.

They are food for many fish and birds, as well as some animal species, and hence, constitute a major link in the food chain and functioning of the ecosystem. Land insects are in abundance and have a positive effect on the breeding of land birds.\n\nKeoladeo National Park is known as a \u201cbird paradise\u201d, since more than 370 bird species have been recorded in the park. Ornithologically, the park assumes significance in two respects: One because of its strategic location as a staging ground for [[migratory waterfowl]] arriving in the Indian subcontinent before dispersing to various regions. Further waterfowl converge here before departing to breeding grounds in the western [[Palearctic]] region. In addition, the wetland is a wintering area for massive congregations of waterfowl. It is also the only regular wintering area in India for the [[critically endangered]] [[Siberian crane]].<ref name=\"Biology\" />\n\n====Birds====\n[[File:Darter at Sunset.JPG|thumb|Darter at sunset]]\n[[File:Indian Saras crane01.JPG|thumb|Indian Saurus crane]]\n[[File:Oriental magpie-robin in Bharatpur National Park.jpg|thumb|[[Oriental magpie-robin]] in Keoladeo National Park]]\nThe park's location in the [[Gangetic Plain]] makes it an unrivalled breeding site for [[heron]]s, [[stork]]s and [[cormorant]]s, and an important wintering ground for large numbers of migrant [[duck]]s. The most common waterfowl are [[gadwall]], [[shoveler]], [[common teal]], [[cotton teal]], [[tufted duck]], [[knob-billed duck]], [[little cormorant]], [[great cormorant]], [[Indian shag]], [[ruff]], [[painted stork]], [[white spoonbill]], [[Asian open-billed stork]], [[oriental ibis]], [[darter]], [[common sandpiper]], [[wood sandpiper]] and [[green sandpiper]]. The [[sarus crane]], with its spectacular courtship dance, is also found here.<ref name=\"Biology\" />\n\nBirds present include [[warblers]], [[Old World babbler|babbler]]s, [[bee-eater]]s, [[bulbul]]s, [[bunting (bird)|bunting]]s, [[chat (bird)|chats]], [[Painted francolin]]s and [[quail]]s, [[Indian grey hornbill]] and [[Marshall's iora]]. Raptors include [[osprey]], [[peregrine falcon]], [[Pallas' sea eagle]], [[short-toed eagle]], [[tawny eagle]], [[imperial eagle]], [[spotted eagle]] and [[crested serpent eagle]]. The [[greater spotted eagle]] has recently been recorded breeding here, a new breeding record for the species in India.<ref name=\"Biology\" />\n\n====Mammals====\n[[File:Sambhars are common sight at Keoladeo Ghana National Park Bharatpur India.jpg|thumb|[[Sambar (deer)|Sambar]] are a common sight at Keoladeo Ghana National Park.]]\n[[File:Neel gai 02.jpg|thumb|A nilgai inside Keoladeo National Park]]\nMammalian fauna of Keoladeo National Park is equally rich with 27 identified species.<ref name=\"Biology\" /> [[Nilgai]], feral [[cattle]], and [[chital deer]] are common while [[Sambar (deer)|sambar]] are few. [[Wild boar]] and [[Indian porcupine]] are often spotted sneaking out of the Park to raid crop fields. Two [[mongoose]] species, the [[small Indian mongoose]] and the common [[Indian gray mongoose]], are occasionally found. [[Felidae|Cat]] species present include the [[jungle cat]] and the [[fishing cat]]. The [[Asian palm civet]] and the [[small Indian civet]] are also present, but rarely sighted. The [[smooth-coated otter]] can be seen attacking birds such as [[coot]]s and at times crossing the woodlands. [[Golden Jackal]]s and [[Striped hyena]]s are also sighted and have taken up the role of predators and feed on birds and rodents. Many species of [[rat]]s, [[mice]], [[gerbil]]s and [[bat]]s are also found in the park.<ref name=\"PC Report\" />\nPrimates include the [[rhesus macaque]] and [[Hanuman langur]]s. Large predators are absent, [[leopard]]s having been deliberately exterminated by 1964, but small carnivores include [[Bengal fox]], jackal, [[striped hyena]], [[Paradoxurus hermaphroditus|common palm civet]], [[small Indian civet]], Indian grey mongoose (''[[Herpestes edwardsi]]''), [[fishing cat]], [[leopard cat]], [[jungle cat]] and [[smooth-coated otter]]. Ungulates include [[blackbuck]], [[chital]], [[Sambar (deer)|sambar]], [[hog deer]], [[nilgai]] and [[wild boar]] and feral cattle.<ref name=\"Biology\" />\n\n====Other species====\nFish fauna of the park comprises 43 species, of which 37 enter the park along with the water from Ajan Bund, and six species are breeding residents. During a good rainy season the park receives around 65 million fish fry and fingerlings. The fish population and diversity are of high ecological importance as they form the food source of many birds.\n\nThe [[herpetofauna]] of Keoladeo National Park is diverse. Out of the ten species of turtles that are seen in Rajasthan, seven are present in this park. Besides this, there are five lizard species, thirteen snake species and seven species of amphibians.  The [[Hoplobatrachus crassus|bullfrog]] and [[skipper frog]] are commonly found in the wetlands.  It is often easy to see a [[Pythonidae|python]] out of its burrow and basking in the sun on a sunny winter day.  The common [[monitor lizard]], [[Indian porcupine]] and [[Hipposideros bicolor|bi-colored leaf-nose bat]] have been seen in the same burrow as that of the python. The venomous snakes found in the park are [[krait]], [[cobra]] and [[Russell\u2019s viper]].<ref name=\"Biology\" />\n\n==World Heritage Site==\n[[File:Eurasian spoonbill01.jpg|thumb|Eurasian spoonbill]]\nTo be included on the World Heritage List, sites must be of outstanding universal value and meet at least one out of ten selection criteria. These criteria are explained in the Operational Guidelines for the Implementation of the World Heritage Convention which, besides the text of the Convention, is the main working tool on World Heritage. The criteria are regularly revised by the Committee to reflect the evolution of the World Heritage concept itself.  The UNESCO convention for listing goes on to explain the criteria the selection of Keoladeo Ghana National Park as a '''World Heritage Site under the Natural Criteria iv of Operational Guidelines 2002''' and the description which follows is that the park is a \u201cHabitat of rare and endangered species. The park is a wetland of international importance for migratory waterfowl. It is the wintering ground for the rare Siberian crane and habitat for large numbers of resident nesting birds.\u201d According to the revised '''Operational Guidelines of 2005''', the park falls under '''Criteria (x)''' which states that to be conferred the status of World Heritage, the site should \u201ccontain the most important and significant natural habitats for in-site conservation of biological diversity, including those containing threatened species of outstanding universal value from the point of view of science or conservation.\u201d<ref name=\"heritage site\" />\n\n==Management==\n\n===Issues===\nThe management objective is to allow the area to flood and dry out annually, rather than be maintained as a system of permanent marshes. Water for the wetlands is supplied from the dam outside the park boundaries. Usually, some 14.17 million cubic meters of water is the estimated annual requirement of the park. The water level inside the park is regulated by means of dykes and artificial embankments. The alternative arrangement of water in case of emergencies such as danger of marshes and water bodies drying out completely is ensured through four boreholes so that survival of the aquatic flora and fauna is not endangered before the arrival of monsoon. The boundaries of the park are clearly delineated by a thirty-two Kilometer long boundary encircling the park restricting the encroachment of humans and domestic cattle inside the perimeters of the park. The road from Bharatpur town which used to intersect the park was also closed and relocated outside the boundary to reduce the disturbance by visitors from the town which helped in bringing down the levels of pollution inside the park considerably. As opposed to most of the national parks in India and elsewhere, Bharatpur Bird sanctuary has no buffer zone. Due to the heavy density of population and more than 15 villages settled on the periphery of park, it was impossible for authorities to create a buffer zone around the bird sanctuary. Grazing and collection of firewood and grass was phased out from the park as far back as 1983.\n\n===Constraints===\nThe [[Siberian crane]], which formerly lived throughout the entire Indo-Gangetic plains of India, is reported to be no longer found in the area. Its absence has been attributed to hunting by nomadic tribes along the species' 5,000 mile migration route from Siberia to Bharatpur.\n\nSome 2,500 cattle and domestic [[water buffalo]] were allowed in the area up until November 1982 when grazing was banned. Predictably, the ban led to a buildup of local resentment, resulting in an attempted forced entry into the park. Police opened fire and eight people were killed: tensions still remain high.<ref>Lewis, M. 2003. ''Cattle and Conservation at Bharatpur: A case study in science and advocacy''. Conservation and Society 1: 1\u201321.</ref> The absence of grazing is causing management problems as vegetation, principally Paspalum distichum, a perennial amphibious grass, blocks up the channels. The Rajasthan government has rejected a proposal from the Bombay Natural History Society to allow limited grazing, since this would conflict with the law. Furthermore, recycled nutrients from the large quantity of dung deposited by livestock probably supported considerable numbers of insects.<ref name=\"PC Report\" />\n\nThe presence of some 700 feral cattle within the park is cause for concern as they compete with wildlife for valuable forage. [[Larva]]e of the [[Lepidoptera]]n ''[[Parapoynx diminutalis]]'' has also been a serious pest, and considerably inhibited the growth of ''[[Nymphoides cristatum]]'' during June\u2013July 1986. High levels of pollutants in Ajan Bund are believed to be responsible for the increasing number of piscivorous birds seen in a dazed state and unable to fly. Fewer birds were recorded in 1984 than in previous years. Four [[sarus crane]]s and 40 [[ring-necked dove]]s were found dead outside the park during 1988 and early 1989, possibly due to [[pesticide poisoning]], and a study of the impact of pesticide use in surrounding areas on the park has been initiated in addition to studies on heavy metal contamination. Disturbance from visitors can be a cause for concern, especially during December and January when visitors come to see the cranes.<ref name=\"research facilities\" />\n\nA non-native water hyacinth Icornia species was introduced in 1961, and has now proliferated to the extent that it is blocking the artificial waterways and filling the impoundments. This is significantly altering the habitat for many bird species, and is a serious management problem. Attempts to control the species have been ineffectual to date.\n\n==Tourism and visitor facilities==\nBy virtue of being one of the best bird watching sites of Asia, more than 100,000 visitors come to the park every year. The range of visitors varies from very serious birdwatchers to school children. Of the visitors, 45,000 are foreign tourists. In addition, the location of the park is such that tourists visiting Agra, Fatehpur Sikri and Jaipur invariably stop over at Bharatpur. The park opens from sunrise to sunset around the year. Food and accommodation facilities are available within the precincts of the park. The only accommodation inside the Keoladeo National Park is available in the property of government Bharatpur Ashoka Forest Lodge and lesser expensive Shanti Kutir, which is maintained and run by the ITDC. Bharatpur Forest Lodge is a quaint hotel in the vicinity of natural treasure trove of the park and has a total of 16 rooms to offer to visitors. Its circuit house and [[dak bungalow]] also offer good accommodation options.{{citation needed|date=November 2015}} Visitors coming to Bharatpur can also stay in palaces, havelis and other heritage properties converted into hotels. It is always advisable to have one\u2019s accommodation pre-booked, especially so during winters. An array of 3 star hotels and resorts are also located in the vicinity of the park where visitors can stay cozily.<ref name=\"Tourism\">[http://rajasthanwildlife.rajasthan.gov.in/wild-life/KeoladeoGhanaNationalPark.htm Tourism in Keoladeo National Park] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110215101142/http://www.rajasthanwildlife.rajasthan.gov.in/wild-life/KeoladeoGhanaNationalPark.htm |date=15 February 2011 }}, Visitor facilities in Park.</ref>Besides the normal tourism activities and self-arranged bird watching tours of the Keoladeo National Park, visitors can also opt for a tour of this birding destination by selecting from an array of luxury tourist train services. Luxury trains like Palace on Wheels include Bharatpur Bird Sanctuary in its tour itinerary.<ref name=\"Luxury Tours\">[http://www.thepalacesonwheels.com/ Keoladeo National Park on board Palace on Wheels]</ref>\n\n==Scientific research and facilities==\nThe Bombay Natural History Society has done considerable work in the area, including the ringing of birds for the last 40 years. The society has recently intensified its operations and has established a hydro-biological station to monitor the ecology of the wetland. Particular attention will be given to any in dramatic change in the vegetation following the ban on grazing. Limnological studies have been carried out by the Zoology Department of the University of Rajasthan, Jaipur. The park authorities are monitoring the bird populations. A documentary film 'Indian birds of the monsoon' was produced by S. and B. Breeden in 1979\u20131980. The park has considerable potential for education, more so than other wetland sites in India, in view of it being relatively near to the cities of Agra, Delhi and Jaipur.\n\nBetween December 1992 and January 1995, a collaborative project between the Governments of India and Russia, International Crane Foundation and Wild Bird Society of Japan was set up to save the Siberian crane. The project focused on releasing captivity bred cranes into the wild, tracking migratory routes of common cranes, and building up the resident crane population in the park. Although the project did not yield the desired results, the successful survival of introduced cranes in the park has given sufficient hope to develop a viable resident population in the future.<ref name=\"research facilities\">[http://www.eoearth.org/article/Keoladeo_(Bharatpur)_National_Park,_India#gen6 Research and Field study initiatives], Scientific research at Keoladeo.</ref>\n\n==Crises of 2007==\n\nA proposal for water supply to Keoladeo National Park, Bharatpur was forwarded by the Government of Rajasthan seeking assistance from Planning Commission as advised and approved by the Ministry of Environment and Forests. Keeping in view the uniqueness of the ecosystem and the capacity to attract a variety of migratory birds the project was thought to be approved in principal with the caveat that the cost be firmed up after a visit to the site by an expert team. The park is in danger of being removed as a Ramsar Site as well as UNESCO World Heritage Site, due to severe drought and abandoning of the park midway by nesting birds in the year 2007.<ref name=\"Drought\">[http://www.thebagh.com/Bharatpur%20Springs%20back%20to%20life.pdf Link text], Drought at Keoladeo National Park.</ref>\n\nA proposal for water supply to Keoladeo National Park, Bharatpur was forwarded by the Government of Rajasthan seeking assistance from Planning Commission as advised and approved by the Ministry of Environment and Forests (MoEF) vide their letter dated 10.04.2008.  As per the MoEF, the proposal is beyond the purview of the existing centrally sponsored scheme of the MoEF, seems to be viable and has the potential to put an end to the eternal [[water scarcity in India|water scarcity]] in Bharatpur National Park.\n\nThe Keoladeo National Park (KNP) is a Ramsar Wetland Site and a [[World Heritage site]].  Due to acute water scarcity, the ecosystem of the Park has been affected badly and this has resulted in reduction in the arrival of migratory birds in the National Park. Water supply is essential for the National Park, which is a wetland and a Ramsar site facing acute shortage of water for the last few years.  Currently, apart from rainfall the Park receives water from \u201cAjan Bund\u201d, a temporary reservoir via the Dakan canal.  Through a small canal dug last year water from Khokhar Weir (Bees Mora) is also available. The total requirement of water for the Park is estimated at about 14.17 million cubic meters (500 MCft).  The supply from Ajan Bund is irregular and subject to the bund being full to the extent of reservoir level at 8.5 meters. During the last several years either water is not supplied or supplied insufficiently.<ref name=\"PC Report\" />\n\nThe project had been prepared to keep in view the need for 400 MCFT of water during late July to August, for a period of 30 days to the Park which is to be had by diverting and lifting flood waters of Yamuna.  The project thus covered diversion of water during monsoon through underground pipes with lifting arrangements over a length of 16&nbsp;km from the off-take point of Goverdhan drain near Santruk village.  The estimated cost of the project as proposed by the State Government was to the tune of Rs. 650 million. The project proposed was to channelize water from Govardhan drain to meet the water deficit of KNP during the months of July to September at the time of requirement.  The major components of the project were construction of a head regulator with control gate at the drain located in the state, raw water reservoir with capacity of 13,000 m, 3 pump houses, DG sets for pumping station and laying and testing of /PCC/MS pipelines.<ref name=\"PC Report\" />\n\n==See also==\n* [[Arid Forest Research Institute]] (AFRI)\n* [[Kanwar Lake Bird Sanctuary|Kanwar Taal Bird Sanctuary]]\n* [[Sultanpur National Park|Sultanpur Bird Sanctuary]]\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{commons category|Keoladeo National Park}}\n*{{webarchive |url=http://webarchive.loc.gov/all/20021009114606/http%3A//www.wcmc.org.uk/protected_areas/data/wh/keoladeo.html |title=WCMC |date=2002-10-09}}\n*Reuters: [https://web.archive.org/web/20071223122111/http://today.reuters.com/News/CrisesArticle.aspx?storyId=DEL95384 Drought-ridden Indian bird park loses its birds].

Several of the matches he refereed involved world boxing champions and Hall of Fame members.\n\n==Personal info==\nPerez was born in [[Brooklyn, New York]] but lived in [[Puerto Rico]] as a youth before returning to [[New York City|New York]]. He currently lives in [[Barnegat Township, New Jersey]]. He was licensed to referee fights both in [[New York (state)|New York]] and in [[New Jersey]].\n\nPerez started boxing as an amateur while in the United States Army, according to [[People Magazine]].<ref>https://people.com/archive/referee-tony-perez-wallops-ali-with-a-20-million-damage-suit-vol-3-no-17/</ref> He was the Army's Caribbean area's Welterweight champion and then went to serve in [[Germany]], where he obtained the Army's European command championship as well.\n\nOne night at a fight his mother attended, he got a cut on one of his eyes, leading her to ask him to give up boxing. Perez got married and had a son, he then worked odd jobs until finding work at a [[Seagram's]] distillery as a salesman. It was then that he decided to return to boxing in the refereeing and judging capacities, but it took him several years to be assigned his first fight.<ref>https://people.com/archive/referee-tony-perez-wallops-ali-with-a-20-million-damage-suit-vol-3-no-17/</ref>\n\nPerez met his future wife, future boxing judge [[Barbara Perez (boxing judge)|Barbara Perez]], as they were both working at the Seagram's distillery.<ref>http://www.njboxinghof.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/BARBARA-PEREZ.jpg</ref> His wife lost a brother, who was a firefighter, during the [[September 11 attacks]] in 2001. She is a member of the New Jersey state's boxing hall of fame.\n\n==Major fights refereed==\nThe first bout that Perez was assigned was the one between [[Buster Mathis]] and [[James J. Woody]], which Mathis won by sixth round technical knockout September 26, 1968 at the [[Madison Square Garden]] in New York.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://boxrec.com/en/event/18121|title=BoxRec: Event|website=boxrec.com}}</ref> On May 26, 1969, Perez was the referee for the [[Dick Tiger]] versus [[Nino Benvenuti]] ten round non-title affair at the Madison Square Garden. Tiger won the fight by ten round unanimous decision; Perez was both the referee and one of the three judges for this fight and he scored it for Tiger 7-2-1;<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://boxrec.com/en/event/15404|title=BoxRec: Event|website=boxrec.com}}</ref> both Tiger and Benvenuti are now members of the [[International Boxing Hall of Fame]]. \n\n===First world title bout===\nThe first world championship bout refereed by Perez was the [[Joe Frazier]] versus [[Jimmy Ellis (boxer)|Jimmy Ellis]] main attraction on Monday, February 16, 1970, Ellis was the defending [[World Boxing Association]]'s world Heavyweight champion with a record of 27 wins and 5 losses, 12 wins by knockout against Frazier, who was undefeated and untied in 24 bouts, with 20 knockout wins, and recognized (Frazier) as the world Heavyweight champion in the American states of [[Illinois]], New York, [[Pennsylvania]], [[Massachusetts]] and [[Maine]]. This bout also took place at the Madison Square Garden. Frazier won the bout by fifth round technical knockout after Ellis could not come out of his corner after the fourth round.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://boxrec.com/en/event/150|title=BoxRec: Event|website=boxrec.com}}</ref>\nTwo weeks later, Perez was back in the ring to referee the bout between future world Middleweight champion [[Rodrigo Valdez]] of Colombia and ranked Puerto Rican Pete Toro, which Valdez lost by ten round decision.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://boxrec.com/media/index.php/Rodrigo_Valdes_vs._Pete_Toro|title=Rodrigo Valdes vs. Pete Toro - BoxRec|website=boxrec.com}}</ref>\n\nOn October 26, 1970, Perez was the referee in the bout between the comebacking [[Muhammad Ali]], who was making his first fight after a three year exile forced by boxing authorities over his refusal to join the [[United States Army]] in 1967, and California's [[Jerry Quarry]], the first of two fights between those two boxers. The bout was held at the City Auditorium in [[Atlanta, Georgia]] and Ali won by third round technical knockout.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://boxrec.com/en/event/15982|title=BoxRec: Event|website=boxrec.com}}</ref>\n\nOver the next three years, Perez oversaw 18 more fights, all in New York and most at the Madison Square Garden or the theater on the Garden's property, the Madison Square Garden's [[Felt Forum]]. Many of these bouts included world champions and top rated boxers such as [[Angel Espada]], [[Harold Weston (boxer)|Harold Weston]], [[Enrique Pinder]], [[Davey Vasquez]], the [[Bobby Cassidy]]-[[Tom Bethea]] match, the Jerry Quarry versus [[Randy Neumann]] fight. [[Jorge Ahumada]] against [[Ray Anderson (boxer)|Ray Anderson]] and [[Vito Antuofermo]] facing Danny McAloon. None of these were generally considered to be very important fights, however.\n===Ali-Frazier II===\nThen, on January 28, 1974, Perez came to the international spotlight when he was chosen to referee [[Muhammad Ali vs. Joe Frazier II|the Muhammad Ali-Joe Frazier rematch]], pitting the two former world Heavyweight champions as they tried to return to the world title, in a match contested for the [[North American Boxing Federation]]'s Heavyweight title. Frazier had 30 wins and one second round knockout loss to [[George Foreman]] (when he lost the world Heavyweight title) while Ali was 43-2, with 31 knockout wins, having lost to Frazier in [[Fight of the Century|their first bout]] on March 8, 1971 and to [[Ken Norton]]; he had avenged the loss to Norton and was now trying to avenge his loss to Frazier; at stake was a fight against Foreman for the world title. Perez made a move that has been somewhat criticized by fans and some sportswriters alike afterward when, after Ali had hurt Frazier with 20 seconds to go in the second round, Perez stepped between the two as he allegedly had heard the bell sound. Ali went on to win by twelve round unanimous decision, but Frazier and his trainer [[Eddie Futch]] were critical of Perez, saying that he was unwilling to take points from Ali for holding Frazier during the encounter.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.thefightcity.com/ali-vs-frazier-2/|title=Jan. 28, 1974: Ali vs Frazier II -- Joe Smokeless As Ali Clinches To Victory|date=January 28, 2019|website=The Fight City}}</ref>\n===Shavers-Stallins===\nOn November 4, 1974, Perez was the referee for a bout that is widely considered by fans and experts as one of the biggest upsets of [[Boxing in the 1970s|boxing of that era]] as [[Bob Stallins]], a 21 win, 24 losses with only 4 knockout wins trialhorse, beat 46 wins, 3 losses, 45 knockout wins top contender [[Earnie Shavers]], dropping Shavers, considered one of the hardest punching boxers in the sport's history and also considered to have one of the strongest chins ever, in round nine. Perez, who was also one of the three official judges for the bout, scored it 6-4 in rounds for Stallins.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://boxrec.com/en/event/30144|title=BoxRec: Event|website=boxrec.com}}</ref> This bout was held at the Felt Forum. Eighteen days later, Perez was back as both referee and judge for the main event between Hall of Fame member [[Emile Griffith]] and Vito Antuofermo at the Madison Square Garden, which Antuofermo won by ten rounds unanimous decision. Perez voted 6-3-1 for the winner.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://boxrec.com/en/event/12857|title=BoxRec: Event|website=boxrec.com}}</ref>\n\n===Ali-Wepner===\nPerez's next assignment also became a very prominent fight in boxing history when, on March 24, 1975, [[Muhammad Ali vs. Chuck Wepner|Ali defended the world Heavyweight title versus Chuck Wepner]]. Perez was called in to referee this bout; his second fight refereed outside New York (the first had been Ali-Quarry I). Underdog [[Chuck Wepner|Wepner]] became an instant celebrity when, in round nine, he scored a knockdown of Ali.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://boxrec.com/en/event/221|title=BoxRec: Event|website=boxrec.com}}</ref> This also became a controversial matter-many have felt that Wepner only dropped Ali because Wepner stepped on Ali's foot as he landed a punch to Ali's heart. Wepner disputes this.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.foxsports.com/boxing/story/muhammad-ali-chuck-wepner-the-bayonne-bleeder-knockdown-060316|title=Chuck Wepner calls the day he lost to Muhammad Ali the greatest of his life|first1=foxsports|last1=Jun 4|first2=2016 at 1:02a|last2=ET|date=June 4, 2016|website=FOX Sports}}</ref> Nevertheless, the knockdown and fight allegedly inspired [[Sylvester Stallone]] to write and film the first [[Rocky]] film.<ref name=\"auto\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/movies/2017/05/02/who-is-real-rocky-chuck-wepner/101158422/|title='Chuck': Five things you should know about the real 'Rocky' Chuck Wepner|first=Bryan|last=Alexander|website=USA TODAY}}</ref> Perez's refereeing that night was, ironically, unsatisfying to the winner Ali, who, according to Perez, complained that Perez let Wepner hit Ali with low blows and called him a \"dirty dog\". Ali commented that Perez was \"not Black and (he's) not White-(he's) Puerto Rican but (he's) trying to be White\", \"He is more Black than White, but he's trying to be White\".\n\nPerez hit Ali and [[ABC Wide World of Sports]] (which televised the bout in the United States) with a suit asking for 20 million dollars,<ref>https://people.com/archive/referee-tony-perez-wallops-ali-with-a-20-million-damage-suit-vol-3-no-17/</ref> a federal court resolved the suit in favor of Ali.<ref>https://law.justia.com/cases/federal/district-courts/FSupp/489/123/2394664/</ref>\n\nPerez was the referee for [[Carlos Monzon]]'s only fight as a professional in the [[United States]], when he stopped [[Tony Licata]] in ten rounds to retain the world Middleweight title at the Madison Square Garden, on June 30 1975.<ref name=\"auto\"/> He next took his first trip abroad as a referee, going to [[Oslo, Norway]] to officiate the match between Monzon's personal friend, Argentina's [[Victor Galindez]] and [[Norway]]'s [[Harald Skog]] for the former's WBA world Light-Heavyweight crown, a bout won by the Argentine by a third round knockout on March 28, 1976.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://boxrec.com/en/event/20932|title=BoxRec: Event|website=boxrec.com}}</ref>\n\nAfter referring several other major fights, including one of [[Yoko Gushiken]] in [[Japan]] and bouts including [[Alexis Arguello]], [[Wilfred Benitez]] (versus [[Bruce Curry]]), [[Alfonso Zamora]], [[Wilfredo Gomez]] and [[George Foreman]], Perez was assigned the [[World Boxing Council]]'s world Junior Lightweight championship fight between 3 division world champion Arguello (defending his second divisional world title) and future two time world Junior Lightweight champion [[Rafael Limon]] of [[Mexico]]. Arguello and Limon fought on Sunday, July 8, 1979 at the Felt Forum, Arguello retaining the title by stopping Limon (who contested the stoppage bitterly) in round eleven.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://boxrec.com/en/event/16587|title=BoxRec: Event|website=boxrec.com}}</ref>\n\n==Fight at Rahway==\nPerez visited [[Rahway State Prison]] in [[Woodbridge Township, New Jersey]], at a time when professional boxing fights were allowed in American prison systems, to oversee the ten round bout between [[James Scott (boxer)|James Scott]] and [[Yaqui L\u00f3pez|Alvaro Lopez]], Saturday, December 1 of 1979, a match in which Perez also served as a voting judge. Scott, who was an inmate at the same jail at that time, won a ten round unanimous decision, Perez scoring the fight 8 rounds to 2.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://boxrec.com/en/event/21055|title=BoxRec: Event|website=boxrec.com}}</ref>\n\n===Cooney versus Norton===\nOn May 11, 1981, Perez was given referee duties for the [[HBO Boxing]] televised event between Heavyweights [[Gerry Cooney]] and the former WBC world champion, Hall of Fame member [[Ken Norton]]. Cooney won the fight by technical knockout 54 seconds into the first round.<ref name=\"auto1\">{{Cite web|url=https://boxrec.com/en/event/29207|title=BoxRec: Event|website=boxrec.com}}</ref> The fight catapulted Cooney into his [[Larry Holmes vs. Gerry Cooney|showdown with Larry Holmes]] for the WBC world title and culminated Norton's career. Perez was criticized for not stopping the match earlier, as Norton was motionless in a corner seconds before Perez intervened.\n\nNext came the WBA world bantamweight title match between champion [[Jeff Chandler (boxer)|Jeff Chandler]] and fellow Puerto Rican, former world champion [[Julian Sol\u00eds]] of [[Puerto Rico]]. This was a rematch and Perez refereed it; on Saturday, July 25, 1981 at the [[Resorts International]] in [[Atlantic City, New Jersey]] Chandler retained the title stopping Solis in seven rounds.<ref name=\"auto1\"/> Three weeks later, Perez was in [[Panama]] refereeing the WBC world Junior Flyweight match between world champion [[Hilario Zapata]], a future Hall of Famer also, and future world champion [[German Torres]] of Mexico.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://boxrec.com/en/event/69131|title=BoxRec: Event|website=boxrec.com}}</ref> On August 15, 1981, Zapata outpointed Torres over fifteen rounds.\n\nThe next major match refereed by Perez pitted an already legendary boxer and (later) Hall of Famer (Arguello) defending his third divisional world title, the WBC Lightweight one, against a future legend, world champion and Hall of Famer himself, [[Ray Mancini]], at Bally's Park Place Hotel and Casino in Atlantic City, October 3, 1981. Arguello retained the title with a fourteenth round knockout<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://boxrec.com/en/event/10412|title=BoxRec: Event|website=boxrec.com}}</ref>in a fight ended by a highlight reel knockout.\n\n===Disqualification of Elisha Obed===\nOn November 12, 1981, Perez was involved in two rather large fights, [[Rocky Lockridge]] versus [[Refugio Rojas]] (won by future world champion Lockridge by ten round majority decision; Perez, also a judge in this fight, scored it for Lockridge 7-2-1) and future world Light Heavyweight champion [[Bobby Czyz]] versus former Junior Middleweight world champion [[Elisha Obed]] of [[The Bahamas]]. The Czyz-Obed bout, a Middleweight contest scheduled for ten rounds, was notable because Perez disqualified Obed in round six for what Perez considered to be excessive holding on the Bahamian's part.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://boxrec.com/en/event/2111|title=BoxRec: Event|website=boxrec.com}}</ref> Obed tried to attack Perez after the match's end, Perez warning him to stay away from Perez.<ref>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQ1opTAmpJI</ref>\n\n===Referring Salvador Sanchez's last bout===\nPerez was the referee, on July 21, 1982, of the last bout fought by legendary Mexican boxer [[Salvador Sanchez]] when he defended, successfully, his WBC world Featherweight title against a then almost unknown, but now also legendary, challenger [[Azumah Nelson]] from [[Ghana]]. Sanchez retained the crown by a fifteenth round technical knockout,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://boxrec.com/en/event/2207|title=BoxRec: Event|website=boxrec.com}}</ref> then died tragically 21 days later, killed in a car crash near [[Mexico City]]. Both Sanchez and Nelson later became members of the International Boxing Hall of Fame as well.\n\n===Luis Resto versus Billy Collins, Jr.===\nAlmost a year after Sanchez-Nelson, Perez was involved in another very controversial fight, although this time no one could blame him for the controversy that arose after the match; On June 16, 1983, in the program headlined by the [[Davey Moore (boxer, born 1959)|Davey Moore]] versus [[Roberto Dur\u00e1n]] WBA world Junior  Middleweight championship bout, Perez got to referee and judge a Junior Middleweight encounter between 14 wins, no losses or ties [[Billy Collins, Jr.]] and 20 wins, 8 losses and 2 ties [[Luis Resto (boxer)|Luis Resto]]. Resto pounded Collins for ten rounds and was initially given a ten rounds unanimous decision win, but Billy Collins, Sr. noticed that padding had been removed from Resto's gloves when Collins, Sr. touched one of them right after the bout. Upon finding evidence of this by the [[New York State Athletic Commission]], the fight's result was overturned and changed to a \"no-contest\" instead. Collins, Jr. sustained career ending injuries to his eyes and died on March 6, 1984 when he crashed his car in [[Antioch, Tennessee]], while Resto and Resto's trainer [[Panama Lewis]] were tried in court during 1986 and sentenced to three and six years in jail, respectively, Resto being released in 1989 and Lewis in 1990.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://boxrec.com/media/index.php/Billy_Collins_Jr._vs._Luis_Resto|title=Billy Collins Jr. vs. Luis Resto - BoxRec|website=boxrec.com}}</ref>\n\nThen, on September 10, 1983, Perez was the referee for the [[Larry Holmes]] versus [[Scott Frank (boxer)|Scott Frank]] WBC world Heavyweight title bout held at the [[Harrah's Marina Hotel and Casino]] in Atlantic City. Holmes beat Frank by fifth round technical knockout.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://boxrec.com/en/event/2375|title=BoxRec: Event|website=boxrec.com}}</ref> Five days later, Perez was back at the Madison Square Garden as referee of the Ray Mancini-[[Orlando Romero]] WBA world Lightweight championship match, which Mancini won by ninth round knockout when Perez counted the Peruvian Romero out as Romero sat on the canvas after a punch.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://boxrec.com/en/event/13709|title=BoxRec: Event|website=boxrec.com}}</ref>\n\n===Coetzee vs. Dokes===\nOn September 23, 1983, Perez participated in another historic fight, when [[Gerrie Coetzee vs. Michael Dokes|Michael Dokes defended his WBA world Heavyweight title against Gerrie Coetzee]]. South African [[Gerrie Coetzee|Coetzee]] beat [[Michael Dokes|Dokes]] by tenth round knockout at the [[Richfield Coliseum]] in [[Richfield, Ohio]],<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://boxrec.com/en/event/2380|title=BoxRec: Event|website=boxrec.com}}</ref> becoming not only the first White world Heavyweight champion since [[Ingemar Johansson]] 23 years before, but also the first world Heavyweight champion from Africa in boxing history.\n\n===Hagler's knockdown===\nPerez refereed the March 30, 1984 world Middleweight title fight between champion [[Marvelous Marvin Hagler]] and his Argentine challenger, [[Juan Roldan|Juan \"The Hammer\" Roldan]] at the [[Riviera (hotel and casino)|Riviera Hotel]] in [[Las Vegas, Nevada]]. In a situation somewhat similar to the Ali-Wepner fight he'd refereed years before, Hagler went down seconds after the first round had begun as he slipped followed by a right hand from Roldan that grazed the champion's head. Perez called it a knockdown, the only official knockdown suffered by Hagler in his professional boxing career. In round three, Roldan became entangled against the ropes after a Hagler combination and fell; Perez also ruled that a knockdown. Hagler eventually retained the title by a tenth round technical knockout.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://boxrec.com/en/event/16322|title=BoxRec: Event|website=boxrec.com}}</ref>\n\n==Jamaica's first world championship==\nPerez was the referee on October 19, 1984 for the match fought for the vacant WBA's world Junior Middleweight title which had been vacated by Dur\u00e1n, between [[Ireland]]'s [[Sean Mannion (boxer)|Sean Mannion]] and [[Jamaica]]'s [[Mike McCallum]]. This bout marked the first time that two women ([[Carol Castellano]] and [[Carol Polis]]) acted as judges in a professional boxing match and, after McCallum's 15 round unanimous decision victory, the first time a Jamaican boxer won a professional boxing world's championship.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://boxrec.com/media/index.php/Mike_McCallum_vs._Sean_Mannion|title=Mike McCallum vs. Sean Mannion - BoxRec|website=boxrec.com}}</ref>\n\n===Julio Cesar Chavez===\nTony Perez was given the responsibility of officiating the WBC world Junior Lightweight title bout between champion [[Julio C\u00e9sar Ch\u00e1vez]] of Mexico and challenger Refugio Rojas as part of the [[Hector Camacho vs. Edwin Rosario]] fight's undercard, June 13, 1986 at the Madison Square Garden. Chavez, Sr. dropped Rojas to the floor several times before winning by seventh round technical knockout.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://boxrec.com/en/event/2999|title=BoxRec: Event|website=boxrec.com}}</ref>\n\nOnly six weeks later, Perez again shared a ring with the Mexican legend when Chavez defended his world title against former and future world champion Rocky Lockridge, whom the future Hall of Famer from Mexico beat by a somewhat controversial, twelve round majority decision with Perez as referee on Sunday, August 3, 1986 at the [[Stade Louis II]] in [[Fontvieille, Monaco]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://boxrec.com/en/event/9144|title=BoxRec: Event|website=boxrec.com}}</ref>\n\n===Bassa-McCauley===\nOn Saturday, March 26, 1988, Perez refereed the [[Fidel Bassa]]-[[Dave McAuley]] rematch for Colombian Bassa's WBA world Flyweight championship in a battle that had generated lots of interest both in Ireland and internationally.

Holyfield, already a world champion in the Cruiserweight division, battled former WBC world Heavyweight champion [[Pinklon Thomas]] on December 9, 1988 at the Convention Hall in Atlantic City, knocking him out in seven rounds.<ref>https://boxrec.com/en/event/1311</ref> Holyfield would later become world Heavyweight champion multiple times.\n\n===Damiani-Du Plooy===\nThe [[World Boxing Organization]] asked Perez to referee their inaugural WBO world heavyweight championship bout on May 6, 1989 at the [[Stadio Nicola de Simone]] in [[Syracuse, Sicily]], [[Italy]] between South Africa's [[Johnny du Plooy]] and Italy's [[Francesco Damiani]]. Damiani won the contest by third round knockout (despite this, most outside the WBO continued recognizing [[Mike Tyson]] as \"undisputed\" champion in the division) Perez was the Italy fight's referee.<ref>https://boxrec.com/en/event/1518</ref>\n\n===Camacho-Paz===\nOn Saturday, February 3, 1990, Perez refereed the match between WBO world Junior Welterweight champion [[Hector Camacho Sr.]] and his challenger, former and future world champion [[Vinny Paz]] (then known as Vinny Pazienza) at the Convention Hall in Atlantic City. Camacho Sr. retained the title by twelve rounds unanimous decision.<ref>https://boxrec.com/en/event/3032</ref>\n\n===Jung Koo Chang-Muangchai Kittikasem===\nPerez flew to [[South Korea]] during 1991 to referee the May 18 bout between WBC World Flyweight champion [[Muangchai Kittikasem]] of [[Thailand]], 14 wins and a loss to [[Michael Carbajal]] coming in with ten wins by knockout, and the 38 wins, 3 losses, 17 wins by knockouts challenger, former WBC world Junior Flyweight champion and future Hall of Famer [[Jung Koo Chang]] of South Korea at the [[Olympic Gymnastic Gymnasium]] in [[Seoul, South Korea|Seoul]]. This match is also considered a classic; Kittikasem had been floored three times (twice in round five and once in round eleven) and was on the verge of being defeated by knockout when he connected with a left hook and right hand that sent Chang down with about one minute left for the fight to finish in round 12, badly hurting Chang. The South Korean fighter rose but was downed again immediately afterwards, with Perez halting the fight with 24 seconds to go, giving the defending world champion a come from behind victory.<ref>https://boxrec.com/media/index.php?title=Fight:19281</ref> This was Chang's last boxing fight and his only knockout loss as a professional boxer.<ref>https://boxrec.com/en/proboxer/2129</ref>\n\n===Mercer KO5 Morrison===\nPerez was the referee of one of the first major boxing [[pay per view]] and WBO fights, when then WBO world Heavyweight champion [[Ray Mercer]] beat [[Rocky V]] star and future WBO world Heavyweight champion [[Tommy Morrison]], to retain the championship, with a fifth round technical knockout that is often considered one of the best finishes in boxing history, October 18, 1991 at the Convention Hall in Atlantic City.<ref>https://boxrec.com/en/event/4055</ref>\n\n===McClellan-Bell===\nPerez's first fight in Puerto Rico took place on Friday, August 6, 1993, at the [[Ruben Rodriguez Coliseum]] in [[Bayamon, Puerto Rico|Bayamon]] as part of a program headed by a [[Felix Trinidad]] fight. In it, WBC world Middleweight champion [[Gerald McClellan]], 28 wins, 2 losses with 26 knockouts, dispatched challenger [[Jay Bell (boxer)|Jay Bell]] in only 20 seconds of the first round, scoring the fastest knockout in a Middleweight world championship fight in professional boxing's history.<ref>https://boxrec.com/media/index.php/Gerald_McClellan_vs._Jay_Bell</ref> This match was broadcast on [[Showtime Championship Boxing]].\n\n===Oliver McCall versus Frank Bruno===\n[[Oliver McCall]], WBC world Heavyweight champion with 26 wins and 5 losses, with 18 knockouts, went to [[London, England]] to defend his title versus British [[Frank Bruno]], 39 wins and 4 losses with 38 knockouts, at [[Wembley Stadium]] on September 2, 1995, with Perez as referee. Bruno won the title by beating McCall by twelve rounds unanimous decision<ref>https://boxrec.com/en/event/6667</ref> in what turned out to be the last win of his career.<ref>https://boxrec.com/en/proboxer/505</ref>\n\n===Camacho Sr.-Dur\u00e1n I===\nTony Perez was then called on to referee the pay per view match between two aging but legendary former world champions, Hector Camacho Sr. and Roberto Dur\u00e1n, which was held on June 22, 1996 at the [[Mark Etess Arena]] in Atlantic City. Camacho Sr. won the contest between the two future Hall of Famers by a 12 rounds unanimous decision<ref>https://boxrec.com/en/event/7222</ref> a victory which Camacho Sr. would repeat several years later in a rematch.\n\n===Roy Jones Jr. controversy===\nPerez was again involved in a controversial match when [[Roy Jones Jr.]], the WBC's world Light Heavyweight champion and, at 34 wins, no defeats or ties, with 29 wins by knockout widely considered either the best or second best fighter in the world at that era, took on challenger [[Montell Griffin]], undefeated and untied in 26 fights with 18 wins by knockout on March 21, 1997 at the [[Taj Majal Hotel and Casino]] in Atlantic City. The champion dropped the challenger in round nine but then threw a punch to his head as Griffin sat on one knee. Perez disqualified Jones Jr., giving Griffin the world championship and Jones Jr. his first loss as a professional. Perez explained that he \"was counting because if he could have continued, (Perez would have taken) one or two points away from Jones\".<ref>https://boxrec.com/media/index.php/Roy_Jones_Jr._vs._Montell_Griffin_(1st_meeting)</ref> This fight was also broadcast on television by HBO Boxing.\n\n==Later years as referee==\nPerez continued to referee for seven more years after the Griffin-Jones Jr. I fight, including many world championship fights taking place in the United States, [[Mexico]], [[Thailand]], [[Germany]] and other places. The last match he refereed was one between Panamanian Darmell Castillo, a 10 win, 8 losses and 2 ties with 6 knockout wins boxer versus [[Bryant Brannon]], a 21 wins, 2 losses with 14 knockout wins contender, at the [[Sovereign Bank Arena]] in [[Trenton, New Jersey]] on October 21, 2005.

Several of the matches he refereed involved world boxing champions and Hall of Fame members.\n\n==Personal info==\nPerez was born in [[Brooklyn, New York]] but lived in [[Puerto Rico]] as a youth before returning to [[New York]]. He currently lives in [[Barnegat Township, New Jersey]]. He was licensed to referee fights both in [[New York (state)|New York]] and in [[New Jersey]].\n\nPerez started boxing as an amateur while in the United States Army, according to [[People Magazine]].<ref>https://people.com/archive/referee-tony-perez-wallops-ali-with-a-20-million-damage-suit-vol-3-no-17/</ref> He was the Army's Caribbean area's Welterweight champion and then went to serve in [[Germany]], where he obtained the Army's European command championship as well.\n\nOne night at a fight his mother attended, he got a cut on one of his eyes, leading her to ask him to give up boxing. Perez got married and had a son, he then worked odd jobs until finding work at a [[Seagram's]] distillery as a salesman. It was then that he decided to return to boxing in the refereeing and judging capacities, but it took him several years to be assigned his first fight.<ref>https://people.com/archive/referee-tony-perez-wallops-ali-with-a-20-million-damage-suit-vol-3-no-17/</ref>\n\nPerez met his future wife, future boxing judge [[Barbara Perez (boxing judge)|Barbara Perez]], as they were both working at the Seagram's distillery.<ref>http://www.njboxinghof.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/BARBARA-PEREZ.jpg</ref> His wife lost a brother, who was a firefighter, during the [[September 11 attacks]] in 2001. She is a member of the New Jersey state's boxing hall of fame.\n\n==Major fights refereed==\nThe first bout that Perez was assigned was the one between [[Buster Mathis]] and [[James J.

Tiger won the fight by ten round unanimous decision; Perez was both the referee and one of the three judges for this fight and he scored it for Tiger 7-2-1;<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://boxrec.com/en/event/15404|title=BoxRec: Event|website=boxrec.com}}</ref> both Tiger and Benvenuti are now members of the [[International Boxing Hall of Fame]]. \n\n===First world title bout===\nThe first world championship bout refereed by Perez was the [[Joe Frazier]] versus [[Jimmy Ellis (boxer)|Jimmy Ellis]] main attraction on Monday, February 16, 1970, Ellis was the defending [[World Boxing Association]]'s world Heavyweight champion with a record of 27 wins and 5 losses, 12 wins by knockout against Frazier, who was undefeated and untied in 24 bouts, with 20 knockout wins, and recognized (Frazier) as the world Heavyweight champion in the American states of [[Illinois]], New York, [[Pennsylvania]], [[Massachusetts]] and [[Maine]]. This bout also took place at the Madison Square Garden. Frazier won the bout by fifth round technical knockout after Ellis could not come out of his corner after the fourth round.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://boxrec.com/en/event/150|title=BoxRec: Event|website=boxrec.com}}</ref>\nTwo weeks later, Perez was back in the ring to referee the bout between future world Middleweight champion [[Rodrigo Valdez]] of Colombia and ranked Puerto Rican Pete Toro, which Valdez lost by ten round decision.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://boxrec.com/media/index.php/Rodrigo_Valdes_vs._Pete_Toro|title=Rodrigo Valdes vs. Pete Toro - BoxRec|website=boxrec.com}}</ref>\n\nOn October 26, 1970, Perez was the referee in the bout between the comebacking [[Muhammad Ali]], who was making his first fight after a three year exile forced by boxing authorities over his refusal to join the [[United States Army]] in 1967, and California's [[Jerry Quarry]], the first of two fights between those two boxers. The bout was held at the City Auditorium in [[Atlanta, Georgia]] and Ali won by third round technical knockout.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://boxrec.com/en/event/15982|title=BoxRec: Event|website=boxrec.com}}</ref>\n\nOver the next three years, Perez oversaw 18 more fights, all in New York and most at the Madison Square Garden or the theater on the Garden's property, the Madison Square Garden's [[Felt Forum]]. Many of these bouts included world champions and top rated boxers such as [[Angel Espada]], [[Harold Weston (boxer)|Harold Weston]], [[Enrique Pinder]], [[Davey Vasquez]], the [[Bobby Cassidy]]-[[Tom Bethea]] match, the Jerry Quarry versus [[Randy Neumann]] fight. [[Jorge Ahumada]] against [[Ray Anderson (boxer)|Ray Anderson]] and [[Vito Antuofermo]] facing Danny McAloon. None of these were generally considered to be very important fights, however.\n===Ali-Frazier II===\nThen, on January 28, 1974, Perez came to the international spotlight when he was chosen to referee [[Muhammad Ali vs. Joe Frazier II|the Muhammad Ali-Joe Frazier rematch]], pitting the two former world Heavyweight champions as they tried to return to the world title, in a match contested for the [[North American Boxing Federation]]'s Heavyweight title. Frazier had 30 wins and one second round knockout loss to [[George Foreman]] (when he lost the world Heavyweight title) while Ali was 43-2, with 31 knockout wins, having lost to Frazier in [[Fight of the Century|their first bout]] on March 8, 1971 and to [[Ken Norton]]; he had avenged the loss to Norton and was now trying to avenge his loss to Frazier; at stake was a fight against Foreman for the world title. Perez made a move that has been somewhat criticized by fans and some sportswriters alike afterward when, after Ali had hurt Frazier with 20 seconds to go in the second round, Perez stepped between the two as he allegedly had heard the bell sound. Ali went on to win by twelve round unanimous decision, but Frazier and his trainer [[Eddie Futch]] were critical of Perez, saying that he was unwilling to take points from Ali for holding Frazier during the encounter.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.thefightcity.com/ali-vs-frazier-2/|title=Jan. 28, 1974: Ali vs Frazier II -- Joe Smokeless As Ali Clinches To Victory|date=January 28, 2019|website=The Fight City}}</ref>\n===Shavers-Stallins===\nOn November 4, 1974, Perez was the referee for a bout that is widely considered by fans and experts as one of the biggest upsets of [[Boxing in the 1970s|boxing of that era]] as [[Bob Stallins]], a 21 win, 24 losses with only 4 knockout wins trialhorse, beat 46 wins, 3 losses, 45 knockout wins top contender [[Earnie Shavers]], dropping Shavers, considered one of the hardest punching boxers in the sport's history and also considered to have one of the strongest chins ever, in round nine. Perez, who was also one of the three official judges for the bout, scored it 6-4 in rounds for Stallins.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://boxrec.com/en/event/30144|title=BoxRec: Event|website=boxrec.com}}</ref> This bout was held at the Felt Forum. Eighteen days later, Perez was back as both referee and judge for the main event between Hall of Fame member [[Emile Griffith]] and Vito Antuofermo at the Madison Square Garden, which Antuofermo won by ten rounds unanimous decision. Perez voted 6-3-1 for the winner.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://boxrec.com/en/event/12857|title=BoxRec: Event|website=boxrec.com}}</ref>\n\n===Ali-Wepner===\nPerez's next assignment also became a very prominent fight in boxing history when, on March 24, 1975, [[Muhammad Ali vs. Chuck Wepner|Ali defended the world Heavyweight title versus Chuck Wepner]]. Perez was called in to referee this bout; his second fight refereed outside New York (the first had been Ali-Quarry I). Underdog [[Chuck Wepner|Wepner]] became an instant celebrity when, in round nine, he scored a knockdown of Ali.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://boxrec.com/en/event/221|title=BoxRec: Event|website=boxrec.com}}</ref> This also became a controversial matter-many have felt that Wepner only dropped Ali because Wepner stepped on Ali's foot as he landed a punch to Ali's heart. Wepner disputes this.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.foxsports.com/boxing/story/muhammad-ali-chuck-wepner-the-bayonne-bleeder-knockdown-060316|title=Chuck Wepner calls the day he lost to Muhammad Ali the greatest of his life|first1=foxsports|last1=Jun 4|first2=2016 at 1:02a|last2=ET|date=June 4, 2016|website=FOX Sports}}</ref> Nevertheless, the knockdown and fight allegedly inspired [[Sylvester Stallone]] to write and film the first [[Rocky]] film.<ref name=\"auto\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/movies/2017/05/02/who-is-real-rocky-chuck-wepner/101158422/|title='Chuck': Five things you should know about the real 'Rocky' Chuck Wepner|first=Bryan|last=Alexander|website=USA TODAY}}</ref> Perez's refereeing that night was, ironically, unsatisfying to the winner Ali, who, according to Perez, complained that Perez let Wepner hit Ali with low blows and called him a \"dirty dog\". Ali commented that Perez was \"not Black and (he's) not White-(he's) Puerto Rican but (he's) trying to be White\", \"He is more Black than White, but he's trying to be White\".\n\nPerez hit Ali and [[ABC Wide World of Sports]] (which televised the bout in the United States) with a suit asking for 20 million dollars,<ref>https://people.com/archive/referee-tony-perez-wallops-ali-with-a-20-million-damage-suit-vol-3-no-17/</ref> a federal court resolved the suit in favor of Ali.<ref>https://law.justia.com/cases/federal/district-courts/FSupp/489/123/2394664/</ref>\n\nPerez was the referee for [[Carlos Monzon]]'s only fight as a professional in the [[United States]], when he stopped [[Tony Licata]] in ten rounds to retain the world Middleweight title at the Madison Square Garden, on June 30 1975.<ref name=\"auto\"/> He next took his first trip abroad as a referee, going to [[Oslo, Norway]] to officiate the match between Monzon's personal friend, Argentina's [[Victor Galindez]] and [[Norway]]'s [[Harald Skog]] for the former's WBA world Light-Heavyweight crown, a bout won by the Argentine by a third round knockout on March 28, 1976.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://boxrec.com/en/event/20932|title=BoxRec: Event|website=boxrec.com}}</ref>\n\nAfter referring several other major fights, including one of [[Yoko Gushiken]] in [[Japan]] and bouts including [[Alexis Arguello]], [[Wilfred Benitez]] (versus [[Bruce Curry]]), [[Alfonso Zamora]], [[Wilfredo Gomez]] and [[George Foreman]], Perez was assigned the [[World Boxing Council]]'s world Junior Lightweight championship fight between 3 division world champion Arguello (defending his second divisional world title) and future two time world Junior Lightweight champion [[Rafael Limon]] of [[Mexico]]. Arguello and Limon fought on Sunday, July 8, 1979 at the Felt Forum, Arguello retaining the title by stopping Limon (who contested the stoppage bitterly) in round eleven.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://boxrec.com/en/event/16587|title=BoxRec: Event|website=boxrec.com}}</ref>\n\n==Fight at Rahway==\nPerez visited [[Rahway State Prison]] in [[Woodbridge Township, New Jersey]], at a time when professional boxing fights were allowed in American prison systems, to oversee the ten round bout between [[James Scott (boxer)|James Scott]] and [[Yaqui L\u00f3pez|Alvaro Lopez]], Saturday, December 1 of 1979, a match in which Perez also served as a voting judge. Scott, who was an inmate at the same jail at that time, won a ten round unanimous decision, Perez scoring the fight 8 rounds to 2.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://boxrec.com/en/event/21055|title=BoxRec: Event|website=boxrec.com}}</ref>\n\n===Cooney versus Norton===\nOn May 11, 1981, Perez was given referee duties for the [[HBO Boxing]] televised event between Heavyweights [[Gerry Cooney]] and the former WBC world champion, Hall of Fame member [[Ken Norton]]. Cooney won the fight by technical knockout 54 seconds into the first round.<ref name=\"auto1\">{{Cite web|url=https://boxrec.com/en/event/29207|title=BoxRec: Event|website=boxrec.com}}</ref> The fight catapulted Cooney into his [[Larry Holmes vs. Gerry Cooney|showdown with Larry Holmes]] for the WBC world title and culminated Norton's career. Perez was criticized for not stopping the match earlier, as Norton was motionless in a corner seconds before Perez intervened.\n\nNext came the WBA world bantamweight title match between champion [[Jeff Chandler (boxer)|Jeff Chandler]] and fellow Puerto Rican, former world champion [[Julian Sol\u00eds]] of [[Puerto Rico]]. This was a rematch and Perez refereed it; on Saturday, July 25, 1981 at the [[Resorts International]] in [[Atlantic City, New Jersey]] Chandler retained the title stopping Solis in seven rounds.<ref name=\"auto1\"/> Three weeks later, Perez was in [[Panama]] refereeing the WBC world Junior Flyweight match between world champion [[Hilario Zapata]], a future Hall of Famer also, and future world champion [[German Torres]] of Mexico.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://boxrec.com/en/event/69131|title=BoxRec: Event|website=boxrec.com}}</ref> On August 15, 1981, Zapata outpointed Torres over fifteen rounds.\n\nThe next major match refereed by Perez pitted an already legendary boxer and (later) Hall of Famer (Arguello) defending his third divisional world title, the WBC Lightweight one, against a future legend, world champion and Hall of Famer himself, [[Ray Mancini]], at Bally's Park Place Hotel and Casino in Atlantic City, October 3, 1981. Arguello retained the title with a fourteenth round knockout<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://boxrec.com/en/event/10412|title=BoxRec: Event|website=boxrec.com}}</ref>in a fight ended by a highlight reel knockout.\n\n===Disqualification of Elisha Obed===\nOn November 12, 1981, Perez was involved in two rather large fights, [[Rocky Lockridge]] versus [[Refugio Rojas]] (won by future world champion Lockridge by ten round majority decision; Perez, also a judge in this fight, scored it for Lockridge 7-2-1) and future world Light Heavyweight champion [[Bobby Czyz]] versus former Junior Middleweight world champion [[Elisha Obed]] of [[The Bahamas]]. The Czyz-Obed bout, a Middleweight contest scheduled for ten rounds, was notable because Perez disqualified Obed in round six for what Perez considered to be excessive holding on the Bahamian's part.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://boxrec.com/en/event/2111|title=BoxRec: Event|website=boxrec.com}}</ref> Obed tried to attack Perez after the match's end, Perez warning him to stay away from Perez.<ref>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQ1opTAmpJI</ref>\n\n===Referring Salvador Sanchez's last bout===\nPerez was the referee, on July 21, 1982, of the last bout fought by legendary Mexican boxer [[Salvador Sanchez]] when he defended, successfully, his WBC world Featherweight title against a then almost unknown, but now also legendary, challenger [[Azumah Nelson]] from [[Ghana]]. Sanchez retained the crown by a fifteenth round technical knockout,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://boxrec.com/en/event/2207|title=BoxRec: Event|website=boxrec.com}}</ref> then died tragically 21 days later, killed in a car crash near [[Mexico City]]. Both Sanchez and Nelson later became members of the International Boxing Hall of Fame as well.\n\n===Luis Resto versus Billy Collins, Jr.===\nAlmost a year after Sanchez-Nelson, Perez was involved in another very controversial fight, although this time no one could blame him for the controversy that arose after the match; On June 16, 1983, in the program headlined by the [[Davey Moore (boxer, born 1959)|Davey Moore]] versus [[Roberto Dur\u00e1n]] WBA world Junior  Middleweight championship bout, Perez got to referee and judge a Junior Middleweight encounter between 14 wins, no losses or ties [[Billy Collins, Jr.]] and 20 wins, 8 losses and 2 ties [[Luis Resto (boxer)|Luis Resto]]. Resto pounded Collins for ten rounds and was initially given a ten rounds unanimous decision win, but Billy Collins, Sr. noticed that padding had been removed from Resto's gloves when Collins, Sr. touched one of them right after the bout. Upon finding evidence of this by the [[New York State Athletic Commission]], the fight's result was overturned and changed to a \"no-contest\" instead. Collins, Jr. sustained career ending injuries to his eyes and died on March 6, 1984 when he crashed his car in [[Antioch, Tennessee]], while Resto and Resto's trainer [[Panama Lewis]] were tried in court during 1986 and sentenced to three and six years in jail, respectively, Resto being released in 1989 and Lewis in 1990.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://boxrec.com/media/index.php/Billy_Collins_Jr._vs._Luis_Resto|title=Billy Collins Jr. vs. Luis Resto - BoxRec|website=boxrec.com}}</ref>\n\nThen, on September 10, 1983, Perez was the referee for the [[Larry Holmes]] versus [[Scott Frank (boxer)|Scott Frank]] WBC world Heavyweight title bout held at the [[Harrah's Marina Hotel and Casino]] in Atlantic City. Holmes beat Frank by fifth round technical knockout.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://boxrec.com/en/event/2375|title=BoxRec: Event|website=boxrec.com}}</ref> Five days later, Perez was back at the Madison Square Garden as referee of the Ray Mancini-[[Orlando Romero]] WBA world Lightweight championship match, which Mancini won by ninth round knockout when Perez counted the Peruvian Romero out as Romero sat on the canvas after a punch.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://boxrec.com/en/event/13709|title=BoxRec: Event|website=boxrec.com}}</ref>\n\n===Coetzee vs. Dokes===\nOn September 23, 1983, Perez participated in another historic fight, when [[Gerrie Coetzee vs. Michael Dokes|Michael Dokes defended his WBA world Heavyweight title against Gerrie Coetzee]]. South African [[Gerrie Coetzee|Coetzee]] beat [[Michael Dokes|Dokes]] by tenth round knockout at the [[Richfield Coliseum]] in [[Richfield, Ohio]],<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://boxrec.com/en/event/2380|title=BoxRec: Event|website=boxrec.com}}</ref> becoming not only the first White world Heavyweight champion since [[Ingemar Johansson]] 23 years before, but also the first world Heavyweight champion from Africa in boxing history.\n\n===Hagler's knockdown===\nPerez refereed the March 30, 1984 world Middleweight title fight between champion [[Marvelous Marvin Hagler]] and his Argentine challenger, [[Juan Roldan|Juan \"The Hammer\" Roldan]] at the [[Riviera (hotel and casino)|Riviera Hotel]] in [[Las Vegas, Nevada]]. In a situation somewhat similar to the Ali-Wepner fight he'd refereed years before, Hagler went down seconds after the first round had begun as he slipped followed by a right hand from Roldan that grazed the champion's head. Perez called it a knockdown, the only official knockdown suffered by Hagler in his professional boxing career. In round three, Roldan became entangled against the ropes after a Hagler combination and fell; Perez also ruled that a knockdown. Hagler eventually retained the title by a tenth round technical knockout.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://boxrec.com/en/event/16322|title=BoxRec: Event|website=boxrec.com}}</ref>\n\n==Jamaica's first world championship==\nPerez was the referee on October 19, 1984 for the match fought for the vacant WBA's world Junior Middleweight title which had been vacated by Dur\u00e1n, between [[Ireland]]'s [[Sean Mannion (boxer)|Sean Mannion]] and [[Jamaica]]'s [[Mike McCallum]]. This bout marked the first time that two women ([[Carol Castellano]] and [[Carol Polis]]) acted as judges in a professional boxing match and, after McCallum's 15 round unanimous decision victory, the first time a Jamaican boxer won a professional boxing world's championship.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://boxrec.com/media/index.php/Mike_McCallum_vs._Sean_Mannion|title=Mike McCallum vs. Sean Mannion - BoxRec|website=boxrec.com}}</ref>\n\n===Julio Cesar Chavez===\nTony Perez was given the responsibility of officiating the WBC world Junior Lightweight title bout between champion [[Julio C\u00e9sar Ch\u00e1vez]] of Mexico and challenger Refugio Rojas as part of the [[Hector Camacho vs. Edwin Rosario]] fight's undercard, June 13, 1986 at the Madison Square Garden.
