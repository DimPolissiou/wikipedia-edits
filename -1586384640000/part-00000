He failed his [[eleven-plus]] and as a youngster he showed promise as a [[association football|footballer]] and [[cricket]]er and played for [[Aston Villa]], although without making any first-team appearances, between 1950 and 1954. An opening batsman, he also played for [[Gloucestershire County Cricket Club]] and [[Warwickshire County Cricket Club]] at cricket, although, again, without making any first-team appearances.\n\nIn 1960 Evans borrowed \u00a3500 to found his own industrial cleaning company, called Exclusive Office Cleaning, which later became Brengreen Holdings.

From November 1984 to 15 June 1989, Evans was the chairman of [[Luton Town F.C.|Luton Town Football Club]]. The club played in the [[Football League First Division]] during Evans' tenure as chairman, and he presided over a controversial membership-only scheme for fans under which only members were allowed to attend matches at the club's home ground and away supporters were banned from the stadium. This was brought about by Millwall fans rioting and damaging the [[Kenilworth]] Road stadium during an FA Cup match against Luton on 13 March 1985.\n\nEvans was also chairman of the [[Lord's Taverners]], along with being a member of the Finance and Administration Sub-Committee (1981\u20131986) and a member of the General Committee (1985\u201386) of [[Middlesex County Cricket Club]]. As a cricketer, he represented Hertfordshire in the [[Minor Counties]] Championship between 1967 and 1968, made two [[Friends Provident Trophy|Gillette Cup]] appearances for the team in 1969, scoring ten runs on his debut but a duck in his second match.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Players: David Evans |publisher=CricketArchive |url=https://cricketarchive.com/Archive/Players/34/34595/34595.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140407081201/http://cricketarchive.com/Archive/Players/34/34595/34595.html |archivedate=7 April 2014 |url-status=live |df=dmy }}</ref> He also made two appearances for Club Cricket Conference, the first in 1973 and the second in 1974.{{Citation needed|date=July 2014}}\n\n==Member Of Parliament==\n\nEvans represented [[Welwyn Hatfield (UK Parliament constituency)|Welwyn Hatfield]] as the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] [[Member of Parliament (United Kingdom)|Member of Parliament]] from 1987, until he lost his seat at the [[1997 United Kingdom general election|1997 general election]].

Four years later, in 1990, he formed Broadreach, another industrial cleaning company, of which he was chairman for 12 years.\n\n==Luton Town==\nEvans served on the club's board of directors from 1977 to 22 May 1990 when he resigned. From November 1984 to 15 June 1989, Evans was the chairman of [[Luton Town F.C.|Luton Town Football Club]]. The club played in the [[Football League First Division]] during Evans' tenure as chairman, and he presided over a controversial membership-only scheme for fans under which only members were allowed to attend matches at the club's home ground and away supporters were banned from the stadium. This was brought about by Millwall fans rioting and damaging the [[Kenilworth]] Road stadium during an FA Cup match against Luton on [[13 March]] [[1985]].\n\nEvans was also chairman of the [[Lord's Taverners]], along with being a member of the Finance and Administration Sub-Committee (1981\u20131986) and a member of the General Committee (1985\u201386) of [[Middlesex County Cricket Club]]. As a cricketer, he represented Hertfordshire in the [[Minor Counties]] Championship between 1967 and 1968, made two [[Friends Provident Trophy|Gillette Cup]] appearances for the team in 1969, scoring ten runs on his debut but a duck in his second match.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Players: David Evans |publisher=CricketArchive |url=https://cricketarchive.com/Archive/Players/34/34595/34595.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140407081201/http://cricketarchive.com/Archive/Players/34/34595/34595.html |archivedate=7 April 2014 |url-status=live |df=dmy }}</ref> He also made two appearances for Club Cricket Conference, the first in 1973 and the second in 1974.{{Citation needed|date=July 2014}}\n\n==Member Of Parliament==\n\nEvans represented [[Welwyn Hatfield (UK Parliament constituency)|Welwyn Hatfield]] as the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] [[Member of Parliament (United Kingdom)|Member of Parliament]] from 1987, until he lost his seat at the [[1997 United Kingdom general election|1997 general election]].

Some examples of technical writing include:\n\n*'''[https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/instruction Instructions] and procedures''' are documents that help either developers or end users operate or configure a device or program.<ref name=Tebeaux/>{{rp|226}} Examples of instructional documents include [[User guide|user manuals]] and troubleshooting guides for computer programs, computer hardware, household products, medical equipment, mechanical products and automobiles.\n*'''[[Proposal (business)|Proposals]].''' Most projects begin with a proposal\u2014a document that describes the purpose of a project, the tasks that will be performed in the project, the methods used to complete the project, and finally the cost of the project.<ref name=Tebeaux/>{{rp|191}} Proposals cover a wide range of subjects. For example, a technical writer may author a proposal that outlines how much it will cost to install a new computer system, a marketing professional may write a proposal with the product offerings and a teacher may write a proposal that outlines how a new biology class will be structured.\n*'''[[Emails]], [[Letter (message)|letters]], and [[memorandum|memoranda]]''' are some of the most frequently written documents in a business.<ref name=Tebeaux/>{{rp|117}} Letters and emails can be constructed with a variety of goals\u2014some are usually aimed at simply communicating information while others are designed to persuade the recipient to accomplish a certain task. While letters are usually written to people outside of a company, [[memorandum|memoranda]] (memos) are documents written to other employees within the business.<ref name=Tebeaux/>{{rp|118}}\n*'''[[Press releases]].''' When a company wants to publicly reveal a new product or service, they will have a technical writer author a [[press release]], a document that describes the product's functions and value to the public.<ref>Perelman, Leslie C., Barrett, Edward, and Paradis James.

For example, a technical writer might evaluate a building that is for sale and produce a trip report that highlights his or her findings and whether or not he or she believes the building should be purchased. Another writer who works for a non-profit company may publish an evaluation report that shows the findings of the company's research into air pollution. \n*'''[[Case study]]''' is a published report about a person, group, or situation that has been studied over time; ''also'' : a situation in real life that can be looked at or studied to learn about something.<ref>{{cite web|title = Dictionary and Thesaurus {{!}} Merriam-Webster|url = http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/case%2520study|website = www.merriam-webster.com|access-date = 2016-01-22}}</ref> For example, an individual's challenging situation at his or her workplace and how he or she resolved it is a case study. \n*'''[[White papers]]''' are documents that are written for experts in a field and typically describe a solution to a technological or business challenge or problem.<ref name=Tebeaux/>{{rp|644}} Examples of white papers include a piece that details how to make a business stand out in the market or a piece explaining how to prevent cyber-attacks on businesses.\n*'''[[Website|Websites]].'''

Word processors such as Scrivener, [[Microsoft Word]], [[Apple Pages]], and [[LibreOffice Writer]] are used by technical writers to author, edit, design, and print documents. Since technical writing is as much about the page's layout as it is the written language, enhanced desktop publishing tools such as [[Adobe InDesign]] and [[LyX]] are also used by Technical Writers.<ref>Johnson, Tom [http://idratherbewriting.com/2011/12/19/what-tools-do-technical-writers-use/ \"What Tools Do Technical Writers Use\".] ''I'd Rather Be Writing''.

When writing instructional procedures to describe mechanical, electrical or software programs; technical writers will use these tools to assist them in simplifying assembly, operation or installation processes. \n*'''[[Component content management system|Component content Management Systems]]''' are also used by technical writers to create help systems and documents. Component Content Management Systems (CCMS) allow writers to create similar outputs as help authoring tools, but they also provide content management features such as version management and built-in workflows.\n*'''[[Graphics software|Image editing software]].''' Often, images and other visual elements can portray information better than paragraphs of texts.<ref name=\"Mike Markel 2012\"/>{{rp|306\u2013307}} In these instances, image editing software like Adobe Photoshop and GIMP are used by technical writers to create and edit the visual aspects of documents like photos, icons, and diagrams.\n*'''[[List of collaborative software|Collaborative software programs.]]''' Because technical writing often involves communication between multiple individuals who work for different companies, it can be a collaborative affair.<ref name=\"Mike Markel 2012\"/>{{rp|57}}  Thus, technical writers use [[Wiki| Wiki Systems]] and shared document work-spaces to work with other writers and parties to construct technical documents.<ref name=\"Mike Markel 2012\"/>{{rp|74}}\n*'''[[Web development tools]].''' Technical writers' jobs are no longer limited to just producing documents. They must now also produce content for company's corporate and other professional web sites.<ref name=Anderson/>{{rp|485}} Web Development Tools like [[Adobe Dreamweaver]] are standard tools in the industry that technical writers are expected to be proficient in. \n*'''[[Text editor]]''' programs such as [[Microsoft Notepad]], [[TextEdit]], or [[WordStar|Wordstar]], allow technical writers to edit [[plain text]]. Text editors can be used to change files such as [[Configuration file|configuration files]], documentation files and [[programming language]] [[source code]]. Text editors are widely used by technical writers working with online content.\n*'''Graphing software.''' In order to portray statistical information like the number of visits to a restaurant or the amount of money a university spends on its sporting programs, technical writers will use graphs and flowcharts.<ref name=\"Mike Markel 2012\"/>{{rp|306\u2013307}} While programs like Microsoft Excel and Word can create basic graphs and charts, sometimes technical writers must produce incredibly complex and detailed graphs that require functions not available in these programs.

Most projects begin with a proposal\u2014a document that describes the purpose of a project, the tasks that will be performed in the project, the methods used to complete the project, and finally the cost of the project.<ref name=Tebeaux/>{{rp|191}} Proposals cover a wide range of subjects. For example, a technical writer may author a proposal that outlines how much it will cost to install a new computer system, a marketing professional may write a proposal with the product offerings and a teacher may write a proposal that outlines how a new biology class will be structured.\n*'''[[Emails]], [[Letter (message)|letters]], and [[memorandum|memoranda]]''' are some of the most frequently written documents in a business.<ref name=Tebeaux/>{{rp|117}} Letters and emails can be constructed with a variety of goals\u2014some are usually aimed at simply communicating information while others are designed to persuade the recipient to accomplish a certain task. While letters are usually written to people outside of a company, [[memorandum|memoranda]] (memos) are documents written to other employees within the business.<ref name=Tebeaux/>{{rp|118}}\n*'''[[Press releases]].''' When a company wants to publicly reveal a new product or service, they will have a technical writer author a [[press release]], a document that describes the product's functions and value to the public.<ref>Perelman, Leslie C., Barrett, Edward, and Paradis James. [http://web.mit.edu/course/21/21.guide/pressrel.htm \"Press jaylan peregrino\".] ''The Mayfield grave naba Handbook of Technical & Scientific Writing''. Retrieved May 4, 2014.</ref> \n*'''[[Specification (technical standard)|Specifications]]''' are design outlines that describe the structure, parts, packaging, and delivery of an object or process in enough detail that another party can reconstruct it.<ref>Perelman, Leslie C., Barrett, Edward, and Paradis James. [http://web.mit.edu/course/21/21.guide/specs.htm \"Specifications.\"] ''The Mayfield Handbook of Technical & Scientific Writing''. Retrieved May 4, 2014.</ref> For example, a technical writer might diagram and write the specifications for a smartphone or bicycle so that a manufacturer can produce the object. \n*'''[[Product description|Descriptions]]''' are shorter explanations of procedures and processes that help readers understand how something works.<ref name=\"Mike Markel 2012\"/>{{rp|564}} For example, a technical writer might author a document that shows the effects of greenhouse gases or demonstrates how the braking system on a bike functions. \n*'''[[R\u00e9sum\u00e9s]] and [[job applications]]''' are another example of technical documents.<ref name=Tebeaux/>{{rp|284\u2013285}} They are documents that are used in a professional setting to inform readers of the author's credentials. \n*'''[[Technical report]]s''' are written to provide readers with information, instructions, and analysis on tasks.<ref name=Tebeaux/>{{rp|141\u2013143}} Reports come in many forms. For example, a technical writer might evaluate a building that is for sale and produce a trip report that highlights his or her findings and whether or not he or she believes the building should be purchased. Another writer who works for a non-profit company may publish an evaluation report that shows the findings of the company's research into air pollution. \n*'''[[Case study]]''' is a published report about a person, group, or situation that has been studied over time; ''also'' : a situation in real life that can be looked at or studied to learn about something.<ref>{{cite web|title = Dictionary and Thesaurus {{!}} Merriam-Webster|url = http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/case%2520study|website = www.merriam-webster.com|access-date = 2016-01-22}}</ref> For example, an individual's challenging situation at his or her workplace and how he or she resolved it is a case study. \n*'''[[White papers]]''' are documents that are written for experts in a field and typically describe a solution to a technological or business challenge or problem.<ref name=Tebeaux/>{{rp|644}} Examples of white papers include a piece that details how to make a business stand out in the market or a piece explaining how to prevent cyber-attacks on businesses.\n*'''[[Website|Websites]].''' The advent of hypertext has changed the way documents are read, organized, and accessed. Technical writers of today are often responsible for authoring pages on websites like \"About Us\" pages or product pages and are expected to be proficient in web development tools.<ref name=Anderson>{{cite book|author=Anderson, Paul V.|title=Technical Communication [A Reader-Centered Approach] 6th Edition|publisher=Thompson Wadsworth|year=2007}}</ref>{{rp|484\u2013504}}\n*'''[[Datasheet|Datasheets]]''' are the document that summarize the features, key specifications, technical characteristics, application circuits and some other important information about the product, machine, equipment, software, application, system in brief.\n*'''API guides''' are written for the developer community and are used to explain the [[Application programming interface|application programming interfaces]].\n*'''Help systems''' are online help centres that provide users with technical information about products and services. They provide content as web pages that are viewed in a browser. The content may be created in help centre software, such as [[Zendesk]], or in [[Help authoring tool|help authoring tools]] or [[Component content management system|component content management systems]] that can create a help centre as an HTML output.\n\n==Tools==\nThe following tools are used by technical writers to author and present documents:\n\n*'''[[Desktop publishing|Desktop publishing tools]] or [[word processors]].''' Word processors such as Scrivener, [[Microsoft Word]], [[Apple Pages]], and [[LibreOffice Writer]] are used by technical writers to author, edit, design, and print documents. Since technical writing is as much about the page's layout as it is the written language, enhanced desktop publishing tools such as [[Adobe InDesign]] and [[LyX]] are also used by Technical Writers.<ref>Johnson, Tom [http://idratherbewriting.com/2011/12/19/what-tools-do-technical-writers-use/ \"What Tools Do Technical Writers Use\".] ''I'd Rather Be Writing''. December 19, 2011. Retrieved May 4, 2014.</ref> These programs function similarly to word processors but provide users with more options and features for the document's design and automate much of the formatting.<ref>[http://www.lyx.org/WhatIsLyX \"What is LyX\"]. ''LyX''. Retrieved May 9, 2014.</ref> \n*'''[[Help authoring tool]]s''' are used by technical writers to create the help systems that are packaged with software products, delivered through web browsers or provided as files users can view on their computers. When writing instructional procedures to describe mechanical, electrical or software programs; technical writers will use these tools to assist them in simplifying assembly, operation or installation processes. \n*'''[[Component content management system|Component content Management Systems]]''' are also used by technical writers to create help systems and documents. Component Content Management Systems (CCMS) allow writers to create similar outputs as help authoring tools, but they also provide content management features such as version management and built-in workflows.\n*'''[[Graphics software|Image editing software]].''' Often, images and other visual elements can portray information better than paragraphs of texts.<ref name=\"Mike Markel 2012\"/>{{rp|306\u2013307}} In these instances, image editing software like Adobe Photoshop and GIMP are used by technical writers to create and edit the visual aspects of documents like photos, icons, and diagrams.\n*'''[[List of collaborative software|Collaborative software programs.]]''' Because technical writing often involves communication between multiple individuals who work for different companies, it can be a collaborative affair.<ref name=\"Mike Markel 2012\"/>{{rp|57}}  Thus, technical writers use [[Wiki| Wiki Systems]] and shared document work-spaces to work with other writers and parties to construct technical documents.<ref name=\"Mike Markel 2012\"/>{{rp|74}}\n*'''[[Web development tools]].''' Technical writers' jobs are no longer limited to just producing documents. They must now also produce content for company's corporate and other professional web sites.<ref name=Anderson/>{{rp|485}} Web Development Tools like [[Adobe Dreamweaver]] are standard tools in the industry that technical writers are expected to be proficient in. \n*'''[[Text editor]]''' programs such as [[Microsoft Notepad]], [[TextEdit]], or [[WordStar|Wordstar]], allow technical writers to edit [[plain text]]. Text editors can be used to change files such as [[Configuration file|configuration files]], documentation files and [[programming language]] [[source code]]. Text editors are widely used by technical writers working with online content.\n*'''Graphing software.''' In order to portray statistical information like the number of visits to a restaurant or the amount of money a university spends on its sporting programs, technical writers will use graphs and flowcharts.<ref name=\"Mike Markel 2012\"/>{{rp|306\u2013307}} While programs like Microsoft Excel and Word can create basic graphs and charts, sometimes technical writers must produce incredibly complex and detailed graphs that require functions not available in these programs. In these instances, powerful graphing and diagramming tools like [[Microsoft Visio]] are used to effectively organize and design graphs and diagrams.<ref>{{cite web|author=Hewitt, John|url=http://www.poewar.com/document-hack-a-technical-writers-journal-visio-meets-framemaker/|title=How Technical Writers use Microsoft Visio|work=Poe War|date=January 18, 2005|accessdate=May 9, 2014|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140512235332/http://www.poewar.com/document-hack-a-technical-writers-journal-visio-meets-framemaker/|archivedate=May 12, 2014}}</ref>\n*'''Screen capture tools''' Technical writers commonly use Screen Capture Tools like [[Camtasia]] and [[Snagit]] to capture their desktops.<ref>{{cite report|author=Brierley, Sean|url=http://www.stc-carolina.org/wiki_attachments/Screen_Captures_102.pdf |title=Screen Captures 102|work=STC Carolina|year=2002|accessdate=May 9, 2014|pages= 5\u20138}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|author=Johnson, Tom|date=December 19, 2011|url=http://idratherbewriting.com/2011/12/19/what-tools-do-technical-writers-use/|title=What Tools Do Technical Writers Use|work=I'd Rather Be Writing|accessdate=May 4, 2014}}</ref> When creating instructions for computer software, it's much easier for a technical writer to simply record themselves completing a task than it is to write a lengthy series of instructions that describe how the task must be performed. Screen capture tools are also used to take screenshots of programs and software running on user's computers and then to create accompanying diagrams.\n\n==List of associations==\n*[[Association for Business Communication]]\n*[[CSVTK|Czech Society for Technical Communication]]\n*[[European Association for Technical Communication]]\n*[[IEEE Professional Communication Society]]\n*[[Institute of Scientific and Technical Communicators]]\n*[[International Association of Business Communicators]]\n*[[SIGDOC]]\n*[[Society for Technical Communication]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*{{dmoz|Arts/Writers_Resources/Non-Fiction/Technical_Writing/|Technical writing}}\n*[https://lastc.org/resources/educational-programs/ Technical Writing Education Programs] - Los Angeles Chapter, [[Society for Technical Communication]] (LASTC)\n*[http://pcs.ieee.org/?q=node/24 IEEE Transactions on Professional Communication]\n*[[Wikiversity:Technical writing|Technical writing courses]] from [[Wikiversity]]\n\n[[Category:Technical communication]]\n", "name_user": "Keron Cyst", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eTools:Punctuation", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technical_writing"}

However, due to the [[2019\u201320 coronavirus pandemic]] shutting down cinemas around the U.S., the film will be released on [[video on demand|digital rental]] on the same day.\n\n==Synopsis==\nAfter the events of the [[Trolls (film)|first film]], Poppy and Branch discover that there are other different kinds of Trolls scattered over six different lands, each devoted to a different form of music: [[Pop music|Pop]], [[Funk]], [[Classical music|Classical]], [[Techno music|Techno]], [[Country music|Country]], and [[Rock music|Rock]]. Their world is about to get a lot bigger, and a whole lot louder, as member of hard-rock royalty, the evil Queen Barb, aided by her father King Thrash, wants to destroy all other kinds of music to let rock reign supreme. With the fate of the world at stake, Poppy and Branch, along with their friends \u2014 Smidge, Legsly, Biggie, Satin and Chenille, Cooper, Guy Diamond and Tiny Diamond \u2014 set out to visit all the other lands to unify the Trolls in harmony against Barb, who is looking to upstage them all and turn them into rock zombies.<ref name=\"Trolls2PostersCast\" /> Meanwhile, Branch tries to find a way to tell Poppy how he feels about her.\n\n==Cast==\n{{castlist|\n* [[Anna Kendrick]] as Queen Poppy, the sweetest, optimistic Queen of the pop Trolls and Branch's love interest.\n* [[Justin Timberlake]] as Branch, an over-cautious, good-hearted survivalist pop Troll and Poppy's love interest.\n* [[James Corden]] as Biggie, a chubby, friendly pop Troll.\n* [[Rachel Bloom]] as Queen Barb, the Queen of the Hard Rock Trolls and Thrash's daughter.\n* [[Ozzy Osbourne]] as King Thrash, former King of the Hard Rock Trolls and Barb's father.\n* [[Anderson Paak]] as Prince D, a Funk Troll and Quincy and Essence's son and Cooper\u2019s twin brother.\n* [[George Clinton (musician)|George Clinton]] as King Quincy, the King of the Funk Trolls.\n* [[Mary J.
