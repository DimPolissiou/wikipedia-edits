Operated by Portland Streetcar, Inc. and [[TriMet]], it consists of two distinct services: the '''A Loop''', which runs [[clockwise]], and the '''B Loop''', which runs counterclockwise. Each service travels a {{convert|4.4|mi|km|1|adj=on}} loop between [[Downtown Portland, Oregon|downtown Portland]] and the [[Central Eastside, Portland, Oregon|Central Eastside]], crossing the [[Willamette River]] on the [[Broadway Bridge (Portland)|Broadway Bridge]] in the north and [[Tilikum Crossing]] in the south. The line connects Portland's downtown, [[Pearl District, Portland, Oregon|Pearl District]], [[South Waterfront, Portland, Oregon|South Waterfront]], and [[Lloyd District, Portland, Oregon|Lloyd District]]. It serves the city's various landmarks and institutions, including the [[Rose Quarter, Portland, Oregon|Rose Quarter]], the [[Oregon Convention Center]], the [[Oregon Museum of Science and Industry]] (OMSI), [[Oregon Health and Science University]] (OHSU), and [[Portland State University]] (PSU).\n\nPortland city officials first proposed building an eastside streetcar line in 1997, at the same time the city council authorized the construction of the [[NS Line|first streetcar line]] in downtown. After several years of planning, the city council adopted the Eastside Streetcar Alignment Study in 2003. Upon its inaugural service in 2012, the Loop Service was known as the '''Central Loop Line''' ('''CL Line'''). It initially ran from Southwest Market Street in downtown Portland to OMSI via the Pearl District. It was re-branded to its current name upon the opening of Tilikum Crossing bridge in 2015.<ref name=\"PS-Loop\">{{cite web|title=Portland Streetcar Loop Service |url=http://www.portlandstreetcar.org/node/193 |publisher=[[Portland Streetcar]] |accessdate=September 7, 2015 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150806004043/http://www.portlandstreetcar.org/node/193 |archivedate=August 6, 2015 |df= }}</ref>\n\n==History==\n===Planning===\n[[File:Broadway Bridge west end.jpg|thumb|left|The Broadway Bridge in 2009, prior to the installation of streetcar tracks]]\n\nPlans to expand the Portland Streetcar east of the [[Willamette River]] emerged in July 1997, at the same time the [[Government of Portland, Oregon|Portland City Council]] authorized the construction of the system's [[NS Line|first line]] on the west side, between [[Northwest District, Portland, Oregon|Northwest Portland]] and [[Portland State University|PSU]].

Operated by Portland Streetcar, Inc. and [[TriMet]], it consists of two distinct services: the '''A Loop''', which runs [[clockwise]], and the '''B Loop''', which runs counterclockwise. Each service travels a {{convert|4.4|mi|km|1|adj=on}} loop between [[Downtown Portland, Oregon|downtown Portland]] and the [[Central Eastside, Portland, Oregon|Central Eastside]], crossing the [[Willamette River]] on the [[Broadway Bridge (Portland)|Broadway Bridge]] in the north and [[Tilikum Crossing]] in the south. The line connects Portland's downtown, [[Pearl District, Portland, Oregon|Pearl District]], [[South Waterfront, Portland, Oregon|South Waterfront]], and [[Lloyd District, Portland, Oregon|Lloyd District]]. It serves the city's various landmarks and institutions, including the [[Rose Quarter, Portland, Oregon|Rose Quarter]], the [[Oregon Convention Center]], the [[Oregon Museum of Science and Industry]] (OMSI), [[Oregon Health and Science University]] (OHSU), and [[Portland State University]] (PSU).\n\nPortland city officials first proposed building an eastside streetcar line in 1997, at the same time the city council authorized the construction of the [[NS Line|first streetcar line]] in downtown. After several years of planning, the city council adopted the Eastside Streetcar Alignment Study in 2003. Upon its inaugural service in 2012, the Loop Service was known as the '''Central Loop Line''' ('''CL Line'''). It initially ran from Southwest Market Street in downtown Portland to OMSI via the Pearl District. It was re-branded to its current name upon the opening of Tilikum Crossing bridge in 2015.<ref name=\"PS-Loop\">{{cite web|title=Portland Streetcar Loop Service |url=http://www.portlandstreetcar.org/node/193 |publisher=[[Portland Streetcar]] |accessdate=September 7, 2015 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150806004043/http://www.portlandstreetcar.org/node/193 |archivedate=August 6, 2015 |df= }}</ref>\n\n==History==\n===Planning===\n[[File:Broadway Bridge west end.jpg|thumb|left|The Broadway Bridge in 2009, prior to the installation of streetcar tracks]]\n\nPlans to expand the Portland Streetcar east of the [[Willamette River]] emerged in July 1997, at the same time the [[Government of Portland, Oregon|Portland City Council]] authorized the construction of the system's [[NS Line|first line]] on the west side, between [[Northwest District, Portland, Oregon|Northwest Portland]] and [[Portland State University|PSU]].

It was designed as a home and hobbyist counterpart for [[Borland C++]]. As the developer focused more on professional programming tools, later Turbo C++ products were made as scaled down versions of its professional compilers.\n\n==History==\n===Borland Turbo C++===\nThe first release of Turbo C++ was made available during the [[MS-DOS]] era on personal computers. Version 1.0, running on [[MS-DOS]], was released in May 1990. An [[OS/2]] version was produced as well. Version 1.01 was released on February 28, 1991,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://community.borland.com/article/0,1410,21751,00.html |title=Software Delivery & Testing - Micro Focus Community |website=Community.borland.com |date= |accessdate=2017-05-02}}</ref> running on MS-DOS. The latter was able to generate both [[COM file|COM]] and [[EXE]] programs and was shipped with Borland's [[Turbo Assembler]] compiler for Intel [[x86]] processors. The initial version of the Turbo C++ compiler was based on a front end developed by TauMetric (TauMetric was later acquired by [[Sun Microsystems]] and their front end was incorporated in Sun C++ 4.0, which shipped in 1994).  This compiler supported the AT&T 2.0 release of C++.\n\n'''Turbo C++ 3.0''' was released in 1991 (shipping on November 20), and came in amidst expectations of the coming release of Turbo C++ for [[Microsoft Windows]]. Initially released as an MS-DOS compiler, 3.0 supported [[C++ templates]], Borland's inline [[assembler (computing)|assembler]], and generation of MS-DOS mode executables for both [[8086]] [[real mode]] and [[Intel 80286|286]] [[protected mode]] (as well as the Intel [[80186]].) 3.0 implemented AT&T C++ 2.1, the most recent at the time. The separate Turbo Assembler product was no longer included, but the inline-assembler could stand in as a reduced functionality version.\n\nSoon after the release of Windows 3.0, Borland updated Turbo C++ to support Windows application development. The Turbo C++ 3.0 for Windows product was quickly followed by '''Turbo C++ 3.1''' (and then '''Turbo C++ 4.5'''). It's possible that the jump from version 1.x to version 3.x was in part an attempt to link Turbo C++ release numbers with Microsoft Windows versions; however, it seems more likely that this jump was simply to synchronize Turbo C and Turbo C++, since Turbo C 2.0 (1989) and Turbo C++ 1.0 (1990) had come out roughly at the same time, and the next generation 3.0 was a merger of both the C and C++ compiler.\n\nStarting with version 3.0, Borland segmented their C++ compiler into two distinct product-lines: \"Turbo C++\" and \"[[Borland C++]]\".  Turbo C++ was marketed toward the hobbyist and entry-level compiler market, while Borland C++ targeted the professional application development market.  Borland C++ included additional tools, compiler code-optimization, and documentation to address the needs of commercial developers.  Turbo C++ 3.0 could be upgraded with separate add-ons, such as Turbo Assembler and [[Turbo Vision]] 1.0.\n\nVersion 4.0 was released in November 1993 and was notable (among other things) for its robust support of templates. In particular, Borland C++ 4 was instrumental in the development of the [[Standard Template Library]], [[expression templates]], and the first advanced applications of [[template metaprogramming]]. With the success of the [[Pascal (programming language)|Pascal]]-evolved product [[CodeGear Delphi|Delphi]], Borland ceased work on their Borland C++ suite and concentrated on [[C++Builder]] for Windows. C++Builder shared Delphi's front-end application framework, but retained the Borland C++ back-end compiler. Active development on Borland C++/Turbo C++ was suspended until 2006 (see below.)\n\nVersion 4.5 was announced on March 20, 1995.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20000829130239/http://www.borland.com/borlandcpp/press/1995/trbobc45.html BORLAND SHIPS TURBO C++ 4.5 - Upgrade Combines Learning Tools with Latest C++ Technologies]</ref> New features include multimedia QuickTour, five new games (Turbo Meteors (an Asteroids-like game), Turbo Blocks, Turbo Cribbage, Turbo 21, Turbo Mah Jongg) with corresponding source codes.

He attended the ''Hasharat Zvi'' school in Halberstadt, and, from age seventeen, the [[Yeshiva]] of Rabbi [[Jacob Ettlinger]] in [[Altona, Hamburg|Altona]];  ''[[hakham|Chacham]]'' [[Isaac Bernays]] was one of his teachers and his model as a [[maggid|preacher]].  While studying in yeshiva Hildesheimer also studied [[classical languages]]. In 1840 he returned to Halberstadt, took his [[matriculation|diploma]] at the public K\u00f6nigliches [[Cathedral#Designation|Dom]]-[[Gymnasium (Germany)|Gymnasium]], and entered the [[University of Berlin]]; he became a disciple of the dominant [[Hegel]]ian school. He studied [[Semitic languages]] and [[mathematics]], and continued his study in [[Talmud]].  In 1842 he went to [[Halle, Saxony-Anhalt|Halle upon Saale]] where he earned his doctorate from the [[Martin Luther University of Halle-Wittenberg|University of Halle-Wittenberg]] in 1844 under [[Wilhelm Gesenius]] and [[Emil R\u00f6diger]] (''{{lang|de|Ueber die rechte Art der Bibelinterpretation}}'', English: ''On the Right Kind of Bible Interpretation''). He then returned to Halberstadt, where he married Henrietta Hirsch, whose dowry made them financially independent.\n\nIn 1851 he became [[Rabbi]] of [[Eisenstadt]] (Kis Marton), [[Kingdom of Hungary (1538\u20131867)|Hungary]] (now located in [[Austria]]); the principal city of the [[Siebengemeinden]] or ''Sheva kehillot''. His first notable act there was to found a [[parochial school]], where correct [[German language|German]] was used, and modern principles of [[pedagogy]] were adopted in teaching [[Secular education|secular]], as well as Jewish, subjects. Hildesheimer initially introduced limited secular studies in the elementary school; the older students received a secular education as well, but with a focus on [[mathematics]] and other subjects that would enhance their understanding of [[gemara]].\n\nNext, Hildesheimer established a [[Yeshiva]]. The Yeshiva was unusual in that it was the only Orthodox institution where students were required to have a significant secular education before they were admitted. Also, the curriculum devoted time to studying [[Tanakh|Tanach]] and the [[Hebrew language]]. Despite this approach, within a few years the Yeshiva attracted a large number of pupils. (After beginning with six students in 1851, the seminary had 128 students in 1868, including one from the [[United States]].) His son, Hirsch Hildesheimer, was a professor there.\n\nIn 1869 the [[Orthodox Judaism|Orthodox minority]] in [[Berlin]] was granted government permission to found a separate Orthodox synagogal congregation, the [[Israelitische Synagogen-Gemeinde Adass Jisroel zu Berlin]]<ref>Adass Jisroel (= adas yissro'el) renders the Yiddish articulation of the Hebrew name in Latin letters according to their German pronunciation.</ref> (Israelite Synagogal Congregation of Adass Yisroel [\u05e2\u05d3\u05ea \u05d9\u05e9\u05e8\u05d0\u05dc] in Berlin; extant from 1869 to 1939, and again since 1989), then comprising about 200 families. They were dissatisfied with Rabbi [[Joseph Aub (rabbi)|Joseph Aub]], appointed in 1867 by the ''J\u00fcdische Gemeinde zu Berlin'' (till 1869 the only Jewish congregation in Berlin). Adass Jisroel chose Hildesheimer to represent them as an \"Orthodox rabbi of standing\". Here, he similarly established a religious school and a [[yeshiva]] (''Rabbinerseminar f\u00fcr das orthodoxe Judenthum in Berlin'' 1873\u20131880, then the name was shortened to ''Rabbiner-Seminar zu Berlin'', known as the [[Hildesheimer Rabbinical Seminary]]), which immediately attracted thirty former pupils. Hildesheimer was thus the real intellectual founder and leader of the ''Adass Jisroel'' congregation.\n\nAided by [[Mayer Lehmann]], the editor of ''Israelit'' in [[Mainz]] (Mayence), Hildesheimer \"exerted his whole energy\" in the fight against [[Reform Judaism]]. In 1861 he took his stand against [[Abraham Geiger]] by criticising Geiger, ''Die Geiger'sche Brosch\u00fcre Notwendigkeit und Maass einer Reform des j\u00fcdischen Gottesdienstes'' (under the name variant Israel Hildesheimer, Mayence: Verlag der Le Roux'schen Hofbuchhandlung, 1861). (In fact, as early as 1847\u2014as the representative of the communities in the [[Magdeburg]] district\u2014he had energetically opposed the Reform attempts of [[Ludwig Philippson]].)\n\nHildesheimer was \"simple in his habits and fearless\"; he had an unusual capacity for work; and his great Talmudic learning \"was joined to practical administrative ability\". He was financially independent, and never accepted remuneration for his rabbinical activity. He was frequently engaged in philanthropic activities connected with his own congregation, but additionally, \"no labor was too great and no journey too long for him\" in the service of the Jews of Germany, Austria, Russia, and even [[Ethiopia|Abyssinia]] and [[Persian Empire|Persia]], so that he came to be known as the \"international [[schnorrer (Yiddish)|schnorrer]]\". Hildesheimer also took a special interest in the welfare of the [[Palestinian Jews|Jews of Palestine]]. In 1860, when the [[missionary]] society of Palestine provided seventy free dwellings for homeless Jews, Hildesheimer himself built houses in [[Jerusalem]] for the free use of Jewish pilgrims and for the poor.\n\nHildesheimer died in [[Berlin]] on 12 July 1899. His grave is preserved in the [[Wei\u00dfensee Cemetery#Cemetery of the Orthodox congregation Adass Jisroel|Cemetery of the Synagogal Congregation of Adass Jisroel]] on Wittlicher Stra\u00dfe, Berlin-Wei\u00dfensee.\n\nIn [[Israel]] the [[moshav]] [[Azri'el]] is named after him, as well as streets in Jerusalem and [[Tel Aviv]].\n\n===Writings===\nHildesheimer contributed articles to various journals and newspapers: the ''J\u00fcdische Presse'', ''Ha-Lebanon'', ''He-Chalutz'' and ''Archives Isra\u00e9lites''. During his lifetime he wrote his name in his books usually as Israel Hildesheimer. His son, Hirsch was editor of the ''J\u00fcdische Presse''.\n\nOther writings include:\n*\"Materialien zur Beurtheilung der Septuaginta\", in: ''Literaturblatt des Orients'', 1848, Nos. 30 et seq.;\n*''Die Epitaphien der Grabsteine auf dem Hiesigen [of Halberstadt] J\u00fcdischen Friedhofe'', 1846;\n*''Verwaltung der J\u00fcdischen Gemeinde Halberstadt'', Halberstadt: D\u00f6lle, 1849.\n*''Offener Brief an den Redacteur der Monatsschrift \"Ben-Chananja\", Leopold L\u00f6v'', Vienna, 1858;\n*''\u05e1\u05e4\u05e8 \u05de\u05e0\u05d7\u05d4 \u05d8\u05d4\u05d5\u05e8\u05d4: \u05db\u05d5\u05dc\u05dc \u05d3\u05d9\u05e0\u05d9\u05dd \u05de\u05d4\u05dc\u05db\u05d5\u05ea \u05de\u05dc\u05d9\u05d7\u05d4 \u05e0\u05d3\u05d4 \u05d7\u05dc\u05d4 \u05d5\u05d4\u05d3\u05dc\u05e7\u05d4 / Minchah Tehorah'', Solomon ben Moses Bonhard, Hildesheimer (ed.)

Engel, 1890).\n\n==Modernisation within Orthodoxy==\nHildesheimer is regarded as a pioneering \"Moderniser\" of [[Orthodox Judaism]] in Germany. He was insistent that for Orthodox Jews living in the [[Western world|West]], there was no possibility to segregate oneself behind ghetto walls. On the contrary, he felt that modern Jewish education must teach Jews how best to confront and deal with modernity in all of its aspects [http://www.yutorah.org/_shiurim/%2FTU9%5FShapiro%2Epdf].\n\nHis firm conviction that traditional Judaism need have no fear of the light of [[European culture]] determined his attitude and his activity in Hungary and Germany from the start, and gave him a definite aim. In an address delivered at his rabbinical seminary and defining his position he said:\n\n{{cquote|Unconditional agreement with the culture of the present day; harmony between Judaism and science; but also unconditional steadfastness in the faith and traditions of Judaism: these constitute the program of the New Community, the standard round which gather the Israelites of Berlin who are faithful to the Law.}}\n\nHe thus undertook a variety of actions which render him a \"modern\" activist and institution-builder. The most important of these, as discussed above, are:\n# Jewish education for males and females which included both religious and secular studies.\n# The [[Yeshiva|seminary]] which incorporated not only secular studies but academic scholarship.\n# Maintaining traditional Jewish attachments to the [[Land of Israel]] and working with the non-Orthodox on its behalf.\n# Working with communal leaders, even non-Orthodox ones, on issues that affected the community, such as anti-Semitism and ritual slaughtering.\n\n===Orthodox opposition===\nThe introduction into the Eisenstadt School of modern methods of education and of secular learning was resented by the [[Orthodox Judaism|Orthodox]]. (Hildesheimer's \"liberal tendencies and sympathy with modern culture\" soon changed this resentment \"to positive antipathy\".) Eventually his Yeshiva was denounced before the representatives of the government at [[Oedenburg]], the result being that the Hungarian government ordered the school closed within twenty-four hours and the pupils removed from the city. Soon afterward, however (1858), Hildesheimer succeeded in obtaining state recognition for the Yeshiva. Interestingly, the Yeshiva also had opponents on the left: Reform saw it as a threat because its graduates would be equipped to defend Orthodoxy against Reform's inroads. In 1860, the zealot [[Akiva Yosef Schlesinger]] placed Hildesheimer under a ban as \"not truly a sincere Jew\" (\"''emessdiger J\u00fcd''\").  Hildesheimer, however, seems to have cared little for the ban.\n\nAt the Hungarian Jewish Congress of 14 December 1868, Hildesheimer at first endeavored to associate himself with the existing Orthodox party. When the impossibility of this union became evident, he formed a separate group, with thirty-five followers, which has been described as \"Cultured Orthodox\". In the Hungarian Jewish Congress held at Budapest in 1869 he defined this party as representing a \"faithful adherence to traditional teachings combined with an effective effort to keep in touch with the spirit of progress\".\n\n==See also==\n*[[Modern Orthodox Judaism]]\n*[[Samson Raphael Hirsch]]\n*[[Torah im Derech Eretz]]\n*[[Torah Umadda]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n*{{cite book |first=David Henry |last=Ellenson |title=Rabbi Esriel Hildesheimer and the creation of a modern Jewish orthodoxy |location=Tuscaloosa, AL |publisher=Univ. of Alabama Press |year=1990 |series=Judaic studies series |isbn=0-8173-0485-1 }}\n\n==External links==\n*{{Internet Archive author |sname=Azriel Hildesheimer}}\n*{{Commonscat-inline|Esriel Hildesheimer}}\n*[http://jewishencyclopedia.com/view.jsp?artid=725&letter=H Hildesheimer, Israel (Azriel)], jewishencyclopedia.com\n*[http://judaism.org/learning/hamaayan/5762/korach.html Rabbi Dr. Esriel Hildesheimer z\"l: part 1]; [http://www.torah.org/learning/hamaayan/5762/pinchas.html part 2], hamaayan\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20050306042702/http://www.jewishhistory.org.il/1820.htm Azriel Hildesheimer], jewishhistory.org.il\n*[http://www.yutorah.org/_shiurim/%2FTU9%5FShapiro%2Epdf Rabbi Esriel Hildesheimer's Program of Torah u-Madda], Marc B.

Engel, 1890).\n\n==Modernisation within Orthodoxy==\nHildesheimer is regarded as a pioneering \"Moderniser\" of [[Orthodox Judaism]] in Germany. He was insistent that for Orthodox Jews living in the [[Western world|West]], there was no possibility to segregate oneself behind ghetto walls. On the contrary, modern Jewish education must teach Jews how best to confront and deal with modernity in all of its aspects [http://www.yutorah.org/_shiurim/%2FTU9%5FShapiro%2Epdf].\n\nHis firm conviction that traditional Judaism need have no fear of the light of [[European culture]] determined his attitude and his activity in Hungary and Germany from the start, and gave him a definite aim. In an address delivered at his rabbinical seminary and defining his position he said:\n\n{{cquote|Unconditional agreement with the culture of the present day; harmony between Judaism and science; but also unconditional steadfastness in the faith and traditions of Judaism: these constitute the program of the New Community, the standard round which gather the Israelites of Berlin who are faithful to the Law.}}\n\nHe thus undertook a variety of actions which render him a \"modern\" activist and institution-builder. The most important of these, as discussed above, are:\n# Jewish education for males and females which included both religious and secular studies.\n# The [[Yeshiva|seminary]] which incorporated not only secular studies but academic scholarship.\n# Maintaining traditional Jewish attachments to the [[Land of Israel]] and working with the non-Orthodox on its behalf.\n# Working with communal leaders, even non-Orthodox ones, on issues that affected the community, such as anti-Semitism and ritual slaughtering.\n\n===Orthodox opposition===\nThe introduction into the Eisenstadt School of modern methods of education and of secular learning was resented by the [[Orthodox Judaism|Orthodox]]. (Hildesheimer's \"liberal tendencies and sympathy with modern culture\" soon changed this resentment \"to positive antipathy\".) Eventually his Yeshiva was denounced before the representatives of the government at [[Oedenburg]], the result being that the Hungarian government ordered the school closed within twenty-four hours and the pupils removed from the city. Soon afterward, however (1858), Hildesheimer succeeded in obtaining state recognition for the Yeshiva. Interestingly, the Yeshiva also had opponents on the left: Reform saw it as a threat because its graduates would be equipped to defend Orthodoxy against Reform's inroads. In 1860, the zealot [[Akiva Yosef Schlesinger]] placed Hildesheimer under a ban as \"not truly a sincere Jew\" (\"''emessdiger J\u00fcd''\").  Hildesheimer, however, seems to have cared little for the ban.\n\nAt the Hungarian Jewish Congress of 14 December 1868, Hildesheimer at first endeavored to associate himself with the existing Orthodox party. When the impossibility of this union became evident, he formed a separate group, with thirty-five followers, which has been described as \"Cultured Orthodox\". In the Hungarian Jewish Congress held at Budapest in 1869 he defined this party as representing a \"faithful adherence to traditional teachings combined with an effective effort to keep in touch with the spirit of progress\".\n\n==See also==\n*[[Modern Orthodox Judaism]]\n*[[Samson Raphael Hirsch]]\n*[[Torah im Derech Eretz]]\n*[[Torah Umadda]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n*{{cite book |first=David Henry |last=Ellenson |title=Rabbi Esriel Hildesheimer and the creation of a modern Jewish orthodoxy |location=Tuscaloosa, AL |publisher=Univ. of Alabama Press |year=1990 |series=Judaic studies series |isbn=0-8173-0485-1 }}\n\n==External links==\n*{{Internet Archive author |sname=Azriel Hildesheimer}}\n*{{Commonscat-inline|Esriel Hildesheimer}}\n*[http://jewishencyclopedia.com/view.jsp?artid=725&letter=H Hildesheimer, Israel (Azriel)], jewishencyclopedia.com\n*[http://judaism.org/learning/hamaayan/5762/korach.html Rabbi Dr. Esriel Hildesheimer z\"l: part 1]; [http://www.torah.org/learning/hamaayan/5762/pinchas.html part 2], hamaayan\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20050306042702/http://www.jewishhistory.org.il/1820.htm Azriel Hildesheimer], jewishhistory.org.il\n*[http://www.yutorah.org/_shiurim/%2FTU9%5FShapiro%2Epdf Rabbi Esriel Hildesheimer's Program of Torah u-Madda], Marc B.

He is characterized by his optimism and child-like attitude, taking influence from other comedic characters, including [[Stan Laurel]] and [[Pee-Wee Herman]]. He is voiced by actor and comedian [[Tom Kenny]].\n\nSpongeBob was created and designed by cartoonist and educator [[Stephen Hillenburg]], The character's name is derived from \"Bob the Sponge\", the host of Hillenburg's comic strip ''The Intertidal Zone''. He originally drew it while teaching marine biology to visitors of the [[Ocean Institute]] during the 1980s. He began developing a show based on the premise shortly after the cancellation of ''[[Rocko's Modern Life]]'', in 1996. The character's first appearance was in the pilot, \"[[Help Wanted (SpongeBob SquarePants)|Help Wanted]]\", which premiered on May 1, 1999. \n\nSpongeBob SquarePants has earned a positive response from media critics and achieved popularity with both children and adults, frequently named as one of the greatest cartoon characters of all time. He has, however, been involved in controversy from conservative social groups for allegedly promoting [[homosexuality]], although Hillenburg has described the character as \"asexual\".<ref name=accuse />\n\n==Role in ''SpongeBob SquarePants''==\nSpongeBob is a good-natured, naive, and enthusiastic [[Aplysina fistularis|yellow tube sponge]].<ref>{{Cite AV media |title=[[The SpongeBob Musical]] |date=June 7, 2016 |last=[[Kyle Jarrow]] |type=Broadway musical |language=English |publisher=[[Tina Landau]] |quote=French Narrator: This fruit is home to one of the most fascinating sea creatures of all\u2014''[[Aplysina fistularis]]'', the yellow sponge.}}</ref> He resides in the undersea city of Bikini Bottom with other anthropomorphic aquatic creatures.

He is characterized by his optimism and child-like attitude, taking influence from other comedic characters, including [[Stan Laurel]] and [[Pee-Wee Herman]]. He is voiced by actor and comedian [[Tom Kenny]].\n\nSpongeBob was created and designed by cartoonist and educator [[Stephen Hillenburg]], The character's name is derived from \"Bob the Sponge\", the host of Hillenburg's comic strip ''The Intertidal Zone''. He originally drew it while teaching marine biology to visitors of the [[Ocean Institute]] during the 1980s. He began developing a show based on the premise shortly after the cancellation of ''[[Rocko's Modern Life]]'', in 1996. The character's first appearance was in the pilot, \"[[Help Wanted (SpongeBob SquarePants)|Help Wanted]]\", which premiered on May 1, 1999. \n\nSpongeBob SquarePants has earned a positive response from media critics and achieved popularity with both children and adults, frequently named as one of the greatest cartoon characters of all time. He has, however, been involved in controversy from conservative social groups for allegedly promoting [[homosexuality]], although Hillenburg has described the character as \"asexual\".<ref name=accuse />\n\n==Role in ''SpongeBob SquarePants''==\nSpongeBob is a good-natured, naive, and enthusiastic [[Aplysina fistularis|yellow tube sponge]].<ref>{{Cite AV media |title=[[The SpongeBob Musical]] |date=June 7, 2016 |last=[[Kyle Jarrow]] |type=Broadway musical |language=English |publisher=[[Tina Landau]] |quote=French Narrator: This fruit is home to one of the most fascinating sea creatures of all\u2014''[[Aplysina fistularis]]'', the yellow sponge.}}</ref> He resides in the undersea city of Bikini Bottom with other anthropomorphic aquatic creatures.
