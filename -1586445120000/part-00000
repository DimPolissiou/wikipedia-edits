The Boston Chapter of SIM was formed through the efforts of Dick Harris, John Dacey and Edgar Canty.  In the Fall of 1976 Mr.  Harris, who was then [[ClO]] at Colonial Gas, was at a meeting in Chicago at which SIM National (then called the Society for the Management of Information Systems - SMIS) was encouraging chapter formation.  Harris obtained a listing of SIM members in the [[Boston]] area, and called Canty and Dacey to arrange an organizing meeting.  The organizing meetings were held at [[Babson College]] through the Fall of 1976 and into the Spring of 1977 and, in addition to Harris, Canty and Dacey, involved Don Brown, Les Ball, Chris Bullen and Charles Hewitt.\n\nThe first Boston SIM meetings began in the Fall of 1977 with the meeting locations alternated between [[Babson College]] and the [[MIT]] Faculty Club. Dick Harris was the first Chapter Chairman, and Jerry Kanter was the first speaker. The Articles of Organization were submitted to the [[Massachusetts]] Secretary of State\u2019s office in May 1981, signed by Edgar Canty. The officers were Les Ball, President; Dave Callahan, Clerk; and Arthur Sarazini, Treasurer. Chapter Directors were [[Bill Synnott]], John Dacey, Dick Harris and Dave Callahan. The Charter of Incorporation was received from national SMIS on June 18, 1981.\n\nThe Boston Chapter's programs include the MIT Sloan School of Management CIO Symposium, The Leadership Development Roundtable, SIM Silver, Sharpen the Leadership Saw, CIO Roundtables in both the Providence, RI and greater Boston areas,  a Practitioner's Roundtable, a Consultants Roundtable, a Help Desk Roundtable and two all-day CIO Summits/Forums. It currently supports the following Outreach programs: Year Up, Teen Voices, [[Common Impact]] and Tech Boston.\n\n====Past and Current Presidents (Chair) of the Boston Chapter====\n{| class=\"wikitable\" border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"8\" cellspacing=\"0\"\n!

The first meeting was held at Southwestern Bell (now ATT) in May 2004 with Darwin John as the speaker.  Geographically, the chapter includes the metropolitan St. Louis region, including surrounding counties in Missouri and Illinois; the region is home to 2.9 million people, 16 colleges and universities, and 9 Fortune 500 companies.\n\nThe St. Louis SIM Charter was received at the New York SIMposium in the fall of 2004.  Since then many chapter members have served on national SIM boards and committees.\n\nFrom its beginning the Chapter concentrated on leadership programs at monthly meetings.  In 2006 it established the annual Leadership Workshop, a 2.5-day event featuring CIO leaders and networking opportunities.  In 2007 Paul Klover organized the first Charity Golf Tournament; it annually provides scholarships for undergraduate students in greater St. Louis.\nThe Chapter is also the primary organizer of a large annual technology conference, Gateway to Innovation, which includes biotech, healthcare, government, and information technology.  Drawing 1,400 participants, high-tech start-ups, 50 vendors and leading speakers, the conference provides a forum for the community to meet and highlight progress and developments.

The Boston Chapter of SIM was formed through the efforts of Dick Harris, John Dacey and Edgar Canty.  In the Fall of 1976 Mr.  Harris, who was then [[ClO]] at Colonial Gas, was at a meeting in Chicago at which SIM National (then called the Society for the Management of Information Systems - SMIS) was encouraging chapter formation.  Harris obtained a listing of SIM members in the [[Boston]] area, and called Canty and Dacey to arrange an organizing meeting.  The organizing meetings were held at [[Babson College]] through the Fall of 1976 and into the Spring of 1977 and, in addition to Harris, Canty and Dacey, involved Don Brown, Les Ball, Chris Bullen and Charles Hewitt.\n\nThe first Boston SIM meetings began in the Fall of 1977 with the meeting locations alternated between [[Babson College]] and the [[MIT]] Faculty Club. Dick Harris was the first Chapter Chairman, and Jerry Kanter was the first speaker. The Articles of Organization were submitted to the [[Massachusetts]] Secretary of State\u2019s office in May 1981, signed by Edgar Canty. The officers were Les Ball, President; Dave Callahan, Clerk; and Arthur Sarazini, Treasurer. Chapter Directors were [[Bill Synnott]], John Dacey, Dick Harris and Dave Callahan. The Charter of Incorporation was received from national SMIS on June 18, 1981.\n\nThe Boston Chapter's programs include the MIT Sloan School of Management CIO Symposium, The Leadership Development Roundtable, SIM Silver, Sharpen the Leadership Saw, CIO Roundtables in both the Providence, RI and greater Boston areas,  a Practitioner's Roundtable, a Consultants Roundtable, a Help Desk Roundtable and two all-day CIO Summits/Forums. It currently supports the following Outreach programs: Year Up, Teen Voices, [[Common Impact]] and Tech Boston.\n\n====Past and Current Presidents (Chair) of the Boston Chapter====\n{| class=\"wikitable\" border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"8\" cellspacing=\"0\"\n!

The first meeting was held at Southwestern Bell (now ATT) in May 2004 with Darwin John as the speaker.  Geographically, the chapter includes the metropolitan St. Louis region, including surrounding counties in Missouri and Illinois; the region is home to 2.9 million people, 16 colleges and universities, and 9 Fortune 500 companies.\n\nThe St. Louis SIM Charter was received at the New York SIMposium in the fall of 2004.  Since then many chapter members have served on national SIM boards and committees.\n\nFrom its beginning the Chapter concentrated on leadership programs at monthly meetings.

[[Totalitarianism|Totalitarian]] governments of the 1930s repressed the federation and imprisoned many of its leaders, limiting operations until the end of [[World War II]]. In 2006 it became part of the [[International Trade Union Confederation]] (ITUC), ending its existence as an independent organization.\n\n==History==\n\n===Founding===\n{{labor}}\n\nThe WCL was founded at [[The Hague]] in 1920 under the name of the '''International Federation of Christian Trade Unions''' (IFCTU) as a confederation of [[trade union]]s associated with the [[Christian democracy|Christian Democratic]] parties of [[Europe]].<ref name=\"wclhistory\">[http://www.cmt-wcl.org/cmt/ewcm.nsf/_/ADE7EA5D9CAB04DAC1256E13004F24DF?OpenDocument \"History.\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928164016/http://www.cmt-wcl.org/cmt/ewcm.nsf/_/ADE7EA5D9CAB04DAC1256E13004F24DF?OpenDocument |date=2007-09-28 }} [http://www.cmt-wcl.org/cmt/ewcm.nsf/_/960E6974C0844F84C1256E3D004B42AA?opendocument Conf\u00e9deration Mondiale du Travail/World Confederation of Labour] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070820050347/http://www.cmt-wcl.org/cmt/ewcm.nsf/_/960E6974C0844F84C1256E3D004B42AA?OpenDocument |date=2007-08-20 }}.

Delegates to an October congress in [[Brussels]] voted to reject the invitation, on the grounds that the WFTU's global unity was \"too artificial\".<ref name=\"wclhistory\"/>\n\nThe matter of affiliation with the [[International Confederation of Free Trade Unions]] (ICFTU) is in dispute.

In 1959, the IFCTU convened a seminar in [[Saigon]] to determine the possibilities for points of unity among world religions in matters of social behaviour.<ref name=\"wclhistory\"/>\n\nIn 1968, delegates to the organization's 16th congress in [[Luxembourg]] voted to transform it into the World Confederation of Labour (WCL). Breaking with the federation's strictly Christian ideology of the past, the newly adopted Declaration of Principles stated it would henceforth be guided by \"either a spiritual concept based on the conviction that man and universe are created by God, or other concepts that lead together with it to a common effort to build a human community united in freedom, dignity, justice and brotherhood.\"<ref name=\"wclhistory\"/>\n\n===Globalization and ITUC merger===\nAs [[globalization]] became more of a threat to union membership throughout the 1980s and 1990s, the WCL increased its efforts to carry out a similar global unification of labour leadership. Its 1993 congress in [[Mauritius]] attempted to lay out a concrete strategy for responding to business attacks on organized labour around the world. The WCL soon obtained consultative status within the [[International Labour Organization]] and joined the International Council of the [[World Social Forum]].<ref name=\"wclhistory\"/>\n\nThe WCL was formally dissolved on 31 October 2006 when it merged with the [[International Confederation of Free Trade Unions]] (ICFTU) to form the [[International Trade Union Confederation]] (ITUC).\n\n==Areas of activity==\nThe WCL had nine areas of labour activity where it focused work.\n\n===Human rights and international labour standards===\nThe WCL worked to enforce respect for international law, especially as codified by the ILO.

Delegates to an October congress in [[Brussels]] voted to reject the invitation, on the grounds that the WFTU's global unity was \"too artificial\".<ref name=\"wclhistory\"/>\n\nThe matter of affiliation with the [[International Confederation of Free Trade Unions]] (ICFTU) is in dispute.

In 1959, the IFCTU convened a seminar in [[Saigon]] to determine the possibilities for points of unity among world religions in matters of social behaviour.<ref name=\"wclhistory\"/>\n\nIn 1968, delegates to the organization's 16th congress in [[Luxembourg]] voted to transform it into the World Confederation of Labour (WCL). Breaking with the federation's strictly Christian ideology of the past, the newly adopted Declaration of Principles stated it would henceforth be guided by \"either a spiritual concept based on the conviction that man and universe are created by God, or other concepts that lead together with it to a common effort to build a human community united in freedom, dignity, justice and brotherhood.\"<ref name=\"wclhistory\"/>\n\n===Globalization and ITUC merger===\nAs [[globalization]] became more of a threat to union membership throughout the 1980s and 1990s, the WCL increased its efforts to carry out a similar global unification of labour leadership. Its 1993 congress in [[Mauritius]] attempted to lay out a concrete strategy for responding to business attacks on organized labour around the world. The WCL soon obtained consultative status within the [[International Labour Organization]] and joined the International Council of the [[World Social Forum]].<ref name=\"wclhistory\"/>\n\nThe WCL was formally dissolved on 31 October 2006 when it merged with the [[International Confederation of Free Trade Unions]] (ICFTU) to form the [[International Trade Union Confederation]] (ITUC).\n\n==Areas of activity==\nThe WCL had nine areas of labour activity where it focused work.\n\n===Human rights and international labour standards===\nThe WCL worked to enforce respect for international law, especially as codified by the ILO.

It became a hit in 1992, reaching number 3 in the United States. A 1993 re-release of the song in the [[United Kingdom]], where the initial release had been a minor hit, peaked at number 8. \"Jump Around\" was featured at position 580 on ''[[Q (magazine)|Q Magazine]]''{{'}}s ''1001 Best Songs Ever'',<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.muzieklijstjes.nl/Q1001bestsongsever.htm|title=Q - 1001 best songs ever (2003)|publisher=}}</ref> number 24 on [[VH1]]'s ''100 Greatest Songs of the 90s'',<ref>{{Cite web | url = http://blog.vh1.com/2007-12-13/top-100-songs-of-the-90s/ | title = 100 Greatest Songs of the '90s | archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20120214035830/http://blog.vh1.com/2007-12-13/top-100-songs-of-the-90s |archive-date= 2012-02-14 |url-status= dead }}</ref> number 66 on VH1's ''100 Greatest Songs of Hip Hop'', number 325 on ''[[Blender (magazine)|Blender]]''{{'}}s ''500 Greatest Songs Since You Were Born'' and number 47 on ''[[NME]]''{{'}}s ''100 Best Songs Of The 1990s''. The song is popular among [[dancehall]] [[disc jockey|DJ]]s and is widely regarded in the United Kingdom as a club classic.\n\n==Development==\nDJ Muggs has stated that he originally produced the beat for Cypress Hill, but rapper B-Real did not want to record at that time.

The song also samples \"Popeye the Hitchhiker\" by [[Chubby Checker]], but it is best known for a high-pitched squealing sound that appears at the beginning of almost every bar\u201466 times in the course of the recording.\n\nThe origin of the squeal has been the subject of debate. The website [[WhoSampled]] credits the 1967 [[Junior Walker|Junior Walker & the All Stars]] track \"Shoot Your Shot\", in which a [[tenor saxophone]] makes the noise.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.whosampled.com/sample/2335/House-of-Pain-Jump-Around-Jr.-Walker-&-the-All-Stars-Shoot-Your-Shot/|title=House of Pain's 'Jump Around' - Discover the Sample Source|author=|date=|website=WhoSampled}}</ref> However, American blogger [[Anil Dash]] and American musician [[Questlove]] of hip hop band [[The Roots]] have pointed to [[Prince (musician)|Prince's]] \"[[Gett Off]]\" as the source. A ''[[Newsweek]]'' reader performed a [[spectrogram]] where the sample more closely matches \"Shoot Your Shot\", and House of Pain member [[Everlast (musician)|Everlast]] himself told Questlove that it is a horn making the squeal and not Prince.

It is typically preceded by a video of the \"Rally Monkey\" shown on the scoreboard video screen, which usually features a clip from a classic movie with the Rally Monkey interposed into the movie scene.  The Rally Monkey then holds up a \"Rally Time\" sign and the chorus of \"Jump Around\" is played to fire up the fans to cheer for the Angels to rally and catch up in the game while the Rally Monkey is shown jumping up and down.\n\n====Melbourne City FC====\nThe song is played by Australian football club [[Melbourne City FC]] after they score goals during home games at [[AAMI Park]].\n\n====New England Patriots====\nThe song was played during the 2015 post-season in [[Gillette Stadium]] when the [[New England Patriots]] scored the final touchdown against the [[Baltimore Ravens]].

The song has played at the beginning of every home game at the [[Dean Smith Center]] since that year.  Just like Madison, during the song the entire [[student section]] jumps up and down. Occasionally, the players are seen dancing to the song as well. When the Tar Heels won the national title in [[2009 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament|2009]], the song was played over the Smith Center loudspeakers after the final buzzer. After the [[2017 NCAA Division I Men's Basketball Tournament]] the song was played at the University of Phoenix Stadium.\n\nWhen the Tar Heels moved a 2010 game against [[Texas Longhorns men's basketball|Texas]] to the [[Greensboro Coliseum]], ''Jump Around'' was played before the opening tip of that game as well.\n\nStarting with the 2012 season, the [[North Carolina Tar Heels football|UNC football team]] started playing the song before home games at [[Kenan Memorial Stadium]].\n\n====University of Wisconsin\u2013Madison====\n[[File:Jump Around Wisconsin Badgers Sept 6 2014.jpg|thumb|right|Students in sections O & P jumping around and dancing in 2014]]\nAt home [[Wisconsin Badgers football|football]] games at the [[University of Wisconsin\u2013Madison]], students \"Jump Around\" to the song between the third and fourth quarters. The tradition grew out of the men's varsity swim team members playing it over a portable CD player and broadcasting via a smuggled-in megaphone to sections O and P during the games to rile up those sections. This began in 1992, well before the official start. In March 1997, at a Fraternity party at [[Delta Tau Delta]] at midnight the song was played with the football team and members of the future stadium employees and it became the midnight anthem for every party until the end of that year. The \"official\" start was on Saturday, October 10, 1998, at the Badgers Homecoming game against the [[Purdue Boilermakers football|Purdue Boilermakers]].<ref name=\"GBO\">{{cite web |author= Andy Bitter |url= http://www.greaterbuckyopen.com/gbofun_campr.htm |title= \"An A - to - Z Guide to Camp Randall'' |url-status=dead |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20080704173545/http://www.greaterbuckyopen.com/gbofun_campr.htm |archive-date=2008-07-04 | accessdate= July 31, 2019 }}</ref> After no offensive points were scored in the third quarter, and en route to their second 6\u20130 start of the modern football era, one of the Badgers' marketing agents, who was in charge of sound, piped the song through the loudspeakers.<ref name=\"ABC News\">{{cite web |title=Wisconsin Football: More Than a Game|first=Jen|last=Brown|url=http://abcnews.go.com/Travel/story?id=1172725&page=1|work=[[ABC News]]|date=September 30, 2005|accessdate=June 3, 2008}}</ref> It stirred up fans and players and eventually became a tradition.<ref name=\"ABC News\" />\n\nHowever, on September 6, 2003 (the Badgers' first home game of the season), with construction of skyboxes surrounding [[Camp Randall Stadium]], UW officials decided to cancel the \"Jump Around\" due to worries about structural integrity.

It is typically preceded by a video of the \"Rally Monkey\" shown on the scoreboard video screen, which usually features a clip from a classic movie with the Rally Monkey interposed into the movie scene.

The song has played at the beginning of every home game at the [[Dean Smith Center]] since that year.  Just like Madison, during the song the entire [[student section]] jumps up and down. Occasionally, the players are seen dancing to the song as well. When the Tar Heels won the national title in [[2009 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament|2009]], the song was played over the Smith Center loudspeakers after the final buzzer. After the [[2017 NCAA Division I Men's Basketball Tournament]] the song was played at the University of Phoenix Stadium.\n\nWhen the Tar Heels moved a 2010 game against [[Texas Longhorns men's basketball|Texas]] to the [[Greensboro Coliseum]], ''Jump Around'' was played before the opening tip of that game as well.\n\nStarting with the 2012 season, the [[North Carolina Tar Heels football|UNC football team]] started playing the song before home games at [[Kenan Memorial Stadium]].\n\n====University of Wisconsin\u2013Madison====\n[[File:Jump Around Wisconsin Badgers Sept 6 2014.jpg|thumb|right|Students in sections O & P jumping around and dancing in 2014]]\nAt home [[Wisconsin Badgers football|football]] games at the [[University of Wisconsin\u2013Madison]], students \"Jump Around\" to the song between the third and fourth quarters. The tradition grew out of the men's varsity swim team members playing it over a portable CD player and broadcasting via a smuggled-in megaphone to sections O and P during the games to rile up those sections. This began in 1992, well before the official start. In March 1997, at a Fraternity party at [[Delta Tau Delta]] at midnight the song was played with the football team and members of the future stadium employees and it became the midnight anthem for every party until the end of that year. The \"official\" start was on Saturday, October 10, 1998, at the Badgers Homecoming game against the [[Purdue Boilermakers football|Purdue Boilermakers]].<ref name=\"GBO\">{{cite web |author= Andy Bitter |url= http://www.greaterbuckyopen.com/gbofun_campr.htm |title= \"An A - to - Z Guide to Camp Randall'' |url-status=dead |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20080704173545/http://www.greaterbuckyopen.com/gbofun_campr.htm |archive-date=2008-07-04 | accessdate= July 31, 2019 }}</ref> After no offensive points were scored in the third quarter, and en route to their second 6\u20130 start of the modern football era, one of the Badgers' marketing agents, who was in charge of sound, piped the song through the loudspeakers.<ref name=\"ABC News\">{{cite web |title=Wisconsin Football: More Than a Game|first=Jen|last=Brown|url=http://abcnews.go.com/Travel/story?id=1172725&page=1|work=[[ABC News]]|date=September 30, 2005|accessdate=June 3, 2008}}</ref> It stirred up fans and players and eventually became a tradition.<ref name=\"ABC News\" />\n\nHowever, on September 6, 2003 (the Badgers' first home game of the season), with construction of skyboxes surrounding [[Camp Randall Stadium]], UW officials decided to cancel the \"Jump Around\" due to worries about structural integrity.

Upon their arrival, the Tekins move to an old mansion which Ali Riza has inherited from his parents, and they quickly adapt to Istanbul. They soon befriend Neyir and Sedef. Sedef falls in love with \u015eevket, but he treats her as his sister. Ali Riza starts working in a company and meets O\u011fuz (O\u011fuz), and from that point he hates O\u011fuz's personality. O\u011fuz leaves the company and works for a rich man named Yaman. \u015eevket starts working in a bank, meets Ferhunde at work and dates her. Necla starts seeing O\u011fuz secretly, while he's already involved with Yaman's wife, Ceyda. Ali Riza resigns due to an honor issue with the boss. Leyla begins her pre-college courses. She meets a guy who persuades her to get on a motor-bike with him. Whilst driving, they accidentally run over an old man; Leyla tries to help him get to the hospital but the guy forces her to get back on the motor bike and they flee the scene. The old man dies and the story gets revealed. Ali Riza stops Leyla from going to the courses but eventually allows her to go again. \u015eevket finds out that Ferhunde is married and ends the affair, but she seduces him again. She divorces her husband to marry \u015eevket. Ali Riza does not approve of the marriage but allows it to go on after \u015eevket threatens to kill himself. They decide to live in the mansion until \u015eevket can buy a house. Sedef attempts suicide; But Ali Riza saves her. Necla suspects O\u011fuz and ends the relationship. Ferhunde resigns with an excuse to have some rest, leaving \u015eevket the only person to pay the Tekins' expenses. She starts lavishing and making instability at home while gaining Necla and Leyla's trust. Leyla starts dating O\u011fuz secretly. Fehunde takes Necla in her car to see Leyla and O\u011fuz, thus starting the friction between the two sisters. Necla gets angry first but later reconciles with Leyla. Ferhunde ruins Fikret's birthday, angering \u015eevket to the point that he expels Ferhunde. She pretends that she's pregnant, causing \u015eevket and Ali Riza to ask her to return. Nurdan, Ferhunde's mother leaves jail and meets the Tekins and reveals that she committed murder. Hayriye gets curious and finds out that the victim was her husband. Ferhunde gets angry and reveals that her stepfather was trying to rape her and Nurdan killed him in Ferhunde's defense. Ferhunde also reveals that she's not pregnant and she lied in order to have a family. Leyla ends her relationship with O\u011fuz, but finds out that she's pregnant. She goes to his apartment to tell him, but sees Ceyda with him. Leyla gets angry and falls from the stairs, causing her baby to abort. The Tekins find out.

Ali Riza accepts the marriage, but stops talking to Leyla. Ferhunde starts blackmailing O\u011fuz secretly. She also shows displeasure towards Sedef and Neyir after finding out about Sedef's love for \u015eevket. Ali Riza reconciles with Leyla and allows O\u011fuz in his house only for her good. Necla befriends Cem in the college. He's rich and handsome and aligns with Ali Riza's moral values; so he accepts Cem's request for a more serious relationship with Necla. Ceyda's pregnant from O\u011fuz, but Yaman believes the baby is his. Fikret calls him from a phone booth and tells him that it is not, causing Yaman to investigate Ceyda and later O\u011fuz, but he makes Yaman trust him again to the point that he stops paying Ferhunde. She tells Yaman that O\u011fuz may have been stealing from him, considering O\u011fuz got rich so fast, prompting Yaman to investigate O\u011fuz's records.
