Members paid for a subscription (initially lasting six releases; later reduced to four releases), and as the shows were released, they were automatically mailed to members. There were also occasional optional releases, which were only mailed on request - these were generally reissues of previously released material. The only FRC issue which was available to non-subscribers was the ''Curtain Call'' box set - this was the only FRC release of material before [[Steve Hogarth]] joined the band, and was sold via both Marillion and Fish's online stores, as well as being an optional FRC release.\n\nAfter the release of FRC-040 in January 2008, the FRC changed to a download-only digital distribution format. This lasted for a further three issues - after FRC-043, the FRC was closed. (Starting with the ''Happiness On The Road'' tour,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.marillion.com/shop/downloads/hotrGlasgow.htm |title=ABC, Glasgow Nov 2008 |publisher=marillion.com |accessdate=2013-03-28}}</ref> Marillion moved to publishing the majority of their live performances from desk recordings as digital downloads, rendering the FRC redundant.)\n\nOnly a limited number of copies were manufactured for each FRC release (believed to be no more than 3,000) and were not re-issued once sold out. Most of the FRC releases are now out of print on CD, but are still available from the band's website as downloads.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n!Year\n!Catalogue #\n!Recorded\n!Venue\n!City\n!Country\n!Notes\n|-\n|2002||[[Front Row Club Issue 1|FRC-001]]||1998-11-09||Ludwigshalle||Dieburg||Germany||\n|-\n|2002||FRC-002||1999-11-18||Academy||Manchester||England||\n|-\n|2002||FRC-003||1995-06-23||Luxor||Arnhem||Netherlands||Supplied with free exclusive FRC T-shirt\n|-\n|2002||FRC-004||1992-05-09||The Borderline||London||England||Optional release - reissue of Racket release Racket 1\n|-\n|2002||FRC-005||1989-12-04||Barrowlands||Glasgow||Scotland||Optional release - reissue of Racket release Racket 3\n|-\n|2002||FRC-006||N/A||N/A||N/A||N/A||Optional release - Michael Hunter, ''River''\n|-\n|2002||FRC-007||1991-10-19||Salle de Fetes Beaulieu||Lausanne||Switzerland||\n|-\n|2002||FRC-008||1997-09-06||Le Spectrum||Montr\u00e9al||Canada|| \n|-\n|2002||FRC-009||1996-04-28||Forum||London||England||\n|-\n|2003||FRC-010||1990-12-12||Moles Club||Bath||England||\n|-\n|2003||FRC-011||2000-11-17||Bass Brewery Museum||Burton-On-Trent||England||Optional release - reissue of Fan Club CD WEBFREE3\n|-\n|2003||FRC-012||2000-12-12||Sala Bikini||Barcelona||Spain|| \n|-\n|2003||FRC-013||1995-09-29||Ahoy||Rotterdam||Netherlands||\n|-\n|2003||FRC-014||1990-02-22||The Ritz||Roseville, MI||USA|| \n|-\n|2004||FRC-015A||1983-10-01||Rundsporthalle||Baunatal||Germany||Optional release - ''Curtain Call'' box set of Fish-era shows\n|-\n|2004||FRC-015B||1986-02-03||Hammersmith Odeon||London||England||Optional release - ''Curtain Call'' box set of Fish-era shows\n|-\n|2004||FRC-015C||1988-01-26||Palatrussardi||Milan||Italy||Optional release - ''Curtain Call'' box set of Fish-era shows\n|-\n|2003||FRC-016||1998-01-10||Ateneu Popular de Nou Barris||Barcelona||Spain||\n|-\n|2003||FRC-017||2001-10-13||013||Tilburg||Netherlands||\n|-\n|2004||FRC-018||1992-09-02||E-Werk||K\u00f6ln||Germany||\n|-\n|2004||FRC-019||1998-11-04||Civic||Wolverhampton||England||\n|-\n|2004||FRC-020||1994-05-27||Pumpehuset||Copenhagen||Denmark||Recording from both 27 and 28 May\n|-\n|2004||FRC-021||2001-02-28||Dingwalls||London||England||\n|-\n|2004||FRC-022||1997-05-29||Tivoli||Utrecht||Netherlands||\n|-\n|2004||FRC-023||2004-04-30||Civic Centre||Aylesbury||England||\n|-\n|2005||FRC-024||1998-11-18||Elys\u00e9e Montmartre||Paris||France||  \n|-\n|2005||FRC-025||1999-12-04||Capitol||Mannheim||Germany||\n|-\n|2005||FRC-026||1999-07-25||Zodiac||Oxford||England||\n|-\n|2005||FRC-027||1995-09-17||Corn Exchange||Cambridge||England||  \n|-\n|2005||FRC-028||1992-10-05||Olympia||S\u00e3o Paulo||Brazil|| \n|-\n|2005||FRC-029||2004-10-08||Theater of the Living Arts||Philadelphia, PA||USA|| \n|-\n|2005||FRC-030||1994-03-20||PC69||Bielefeld||Germany|| \n|-\n|2006||FRC-031||1997-09-20 ||The Rave||Milwaukee, WI||USA|| \n|-\n|2006||FRC-032||2002-08-03||Richmond Live Festival||Richmond||England|| \n|-\n|2006||FRC-033||1992-09-05||Wembley Arena||London||England||\n|-\n|2006||FRC-034||2005-12-03||Vredenburg Muziekcentrum||Utrecht||Netherlands||\n|-\n|2006||FRC-035||2005-12-05||Forum||London||England||Free bonus issue with FRC-34\n|-\n|2007||FRC-036||1989-10-05 ||Palais Des Sports||Besan\u00e7on||France||\n|-\n|2007||FRC-037||2005-06-12||Bowery Ballroom||New York City, NY||USA||Los Trios Marillos\n|-\n|2007||FRC-038||2007-05-22||Klub Stodola||Warsaw||Poland|| \n|-\n|2007||FRC-039||1991-09-16||Royal Court Theatre||Liverpool||England|| \n|-\n|2008||FRC-040||2007-12-12||Paradiso||Amsterdam||Netherlands||\n|-\n|2008||FRC-041||1995-08-15||The Chance||Poughkeepsie, NY||USA||Download only\n|-\n|2008||FRC-042||2005-09-11||The Great American Music Hall||San Francisco, CA||USA||Download only; Los Trios Marillos\n|-\n|2008||FRC-043||2007-11-30||The Academy||Manchester||England||Download only\n|}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*[http://www.marillion.com/music/discography.htm Official discography of Marillion]\n\n{{Marillion}}\n\n*Bibliography:\nJacqueline Chekroun, ''Marillion, l'\u00e8re du Poisson'', France 1994.

They have released nine albums which reached the Top 10 of the [[UK Albums Chart]]. Their discography includes two albums which have been Platinum-certified by the [[British Phonographic Industry]] and five which have achieved Gold status, all of which were released during their commercial peak in the 1980s.\n\n==Albums==\n===Studio albums===\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!rowspan=\"2\"| Year\n!rowspan=\"2\"| Title\n!colspan=\"7\"| Peak chart positions\n!rowspan=\"2\"|

Members paid for a subscription (initially lasting six releases; later reduced to four releases), and as the shows were released, they were automatically mailed to members. There were also occasional optional releases, which were only mailed on request - these were generally reissues of previously released material. The only FRC issue which was available to non-subscribers was the ''Curtain Call'' box set - this was the only FRC release of material before [[Steve Hogarth]] joined the band, and was sold via both Marillion and Fish's online stores, as well as being an optional FRC release.\n\nAfter the release of FRC-040 in January 2008, the FRC changed to a download-only digital distribution format. This lasted for a further three issues - after FRC-043, the FRC was closed. (Starting with the ''Happiness On The Road'' tour,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.marillion.com/shop/downloads/hotrGlasgow.htm |title=ABC, Glasgow Nov 2008 |publisher=marillion.com |accessdate=2013-03-28}}</ref> Marillion moved to publishing the majority of their live performances from desk recordings as digital downloads, rendering the FRC redundant.)\n\nOnly a limited number of copies were manufactured for each FRC release (believed to be no more than 3,000) and were not re-issued once sold out. Most of the FRC releases are now out of print on CD, but are still available from the band's website as downloads.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n!Year\n!Catalogue #\n!Recorded\n!Venue\n!City\n!Country\n!Notes\n|-\n|2002||[[Front Row Club Issue 1|FRC-001]]||1998-11-09||Ludwigshalle||Dieburg||Germany||\n|-\n|2002||FRC-002||1999-11-18||Academy||Manchester||England||\n|-\n|2002||FRC-003||1995-06-23||Luxor||Arnhem||Netherlands||Supplied with free exclusive FRC T-shirt\n|-\n|2002||FRC-004||1992-05-09||The Borderline||London||England||Optional release - reissue of Racket release Racket 1\n|-\n|2002||FRC-005||1989-12-04||Barrowlands||Glasgow||Scotland||Optional release - reissue of Racket release Racket 3\n|-\n|2002||FRC-006||N/A||N/A||N/A||N/A||Optional release - Michael Hunter, ''River''\n|-\n|2002||FRC-007||1991-10-19||Salle de Fetes Beaulieu||Lausanne||Switzerland||\n|-\n|2002||FRC-008||1997-09-06||Le Spectrum||Montr\u00e9al||Canada|| \n|-\n|2002||FRC-009||1996-04-28||Forum||London||England||\n|-\n|2003||FRC-010||1990-12-12||Moles Club||Bath||England||\n|-\n|2003||FRC-011||2000-11-17||Bass Brewery Museum||Burton-On-Trent||England||Optional release - reissue of Fan Club CD WEBFREE3\n|-\n|2003||FRC-012||2000-12-12||Sala Bikini||Barcelona||Spain|| \n|-\n|2003||FRC-013||1995-09-29||Ahoy||Rotterdam||Netherlands||\n|-\n|2003||FRC-014||1990-02-22||The Ritz||Roseville, MI||USA|| \n|-\n|2004||FRC-015A||1983-10-01||Rundsporthalle||Baunatal||Germany||Optional release - ''Curtain Call'' box set of Fish-era shows\n|-\n|2004||FRC-015B||1986-02-03||Hammersmith Odeon||London||England||Optional release - ''Curtain Call'' box set of Fish-era shows\n|-\n|2004||FRC-015C||1988-01-26||Palatrussardi||Milan||Italy||Optional release - ''Curtain Call'' box set of Fish-era shows\n|-\n|2003||FRC-016||1998-01-10||Ateneu Popular de Nou Barris||Barcelona||Spain||\n|-\n|2003||FRC-017||2001-10-13||013||Tilburg||Netherlands||\n|-\n|2004||FRC-018||1992-09-02||E-Werk||K\u00f6ln||Germany||\n|-\n|2004||FRC-019||1998-11-04||Civic||Wolverhampton||England||\n|-\n|2004||FRC-020||1994-05-27||Pumpehuset||Copenhagen||Denmark||Recording from both 27 and 28 May\n|-\n|2004||FRC-021||2001-02-28||Dingwalls||London||England||\n|-\n|2004||FRC-022||1997-05-29||Tivoli||Utrecht||Netherlands||\n|-\n|2004||FRC-023||2004-04-30||Civic Centre||Aylesbury||England||\n|-\n|2005||FRC-024||1998-11-18||Elys\u00e9e Montmartre||Paris||France||  \n|-\n|2005||FRC-025||1999-12-04||Capitol||Mannheim||Germany||\n|-\n|2005||FRC-026||1999-07-25||Zodiac||Oxford||England||\n|-\n|2005||FRC-027||1995-09-17||Corn Exchange||Cambridge||England||  \n|-\n|2005||FRC-028||1992-10-05||Olympia||S\u00e3o Paulo||Brazil|| \n|-\n|2005||FRC-029||2004-10-08||Theater of the Living Arts||Philadelphia, PA||USA|| \n|-\n|2005||FRC-030||1994-03-20||PC69||Bielefeld||Germany|| \n|-\n|2006||FRC-031||1997-09-20 ||The Rave||Milwaukee, WI||USA|| \n|-\n|2006||FRC-032||2002-08-03||Richmond Live Festival||Richmond||England|| \n|-\n|2006||FRC-033||1992-09-05||Wembley Arena||London||England||\n|-\n|2006||FRC-034||2005-12-03||Vredenburg Muziekcentrum||Utrecht||Netherlands||\n|-\n|2006||FRC-035||2005-12-05||Forum||London||England||Free bonus issue with FRC-34\n|-\n|2007||FRC-036||1989-10-05 ||Palais Des Sports||Besan\u00e7on||France||\n|-\n|2007||FRC-037||2005-06-12||Bowery Ballroom||New York City, NY||USA||Los Trios Marillos\n|-\n|2007||FRC-038||2007-05-22||Klub Stodola||Warsaw||Poland|| \n|-\n|2007||FRC-039||1991-09-16||Royal Court Theatre||Liverpool||England|| \n|-\n|2008||FRC-040||2007-12-12||Paradiso||Amsterdam||Netherlands||\n|-\n|2008||FRC-041||1995-08-15||The Chance||Poughkeepsie, NY||USA||Download only\n|-\n|2008||FRC-042||2005-09-11||The Great American Music Hall||San Francisco, CA||USA||Download only; Los Trios Marillos\n|-\n|2008||FRC-043||2007-11-30||The Academy||Manchester||England||Download only\n|}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*[http://www.marillion.com/music/discography.htm Official discography of Marillion]\n\n{{Marillion}}\n\n*Bibliography:\nJacqueline Chekroun, ''Marillion, l'\u00e8re du Poisson'', France 1994.

{"title_page": "Aubrey Jackman", "text_new": "{{notability|Biographies|date=June 2012}}\n'''Aubrey Francis Jackman''' {{post-nominals|MBE}} (1921 - 18 September 2010) was a leading producer of international [[military tattoo]]s and prominent hotelier in Bath, England.\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Jackman1967.jpg|frameless|right|Aubrey Jackman in 1967 at the Canadian Armed Forces Tattoo]] -->\nBorn in Bath in 1921, Jackman's family owned a number of hotels in the city, including the Lansdown Grove, Pulteney Hotel and Fernley (now known as the Abbey) Hotel. Following the outbreak of [[World War II]], Jackman attempted to join the [[British Army]], but with his agricultural experience (having studied at the [[Royal Agricultural College]]) he was instead sent to work on a farm in Somerset.\n\nIn 1940 Jackman enlisted in the Local Defence Volunteers ([[Home Guard (United Kingdom)|Home Guard]]). He was then later permitted to join the Somerset Light Infantry as an officer in February 1941, rising to the rank of Major. Jackman's military postings included Egypt, Palestine, Lebanon, Greece, Italy and Austria. He became heavily involved in organising entertainment for the troops, and ended his Army career in 1947, have been demobilised without ever having to fire a shot in anger.\n\nOn his return to England, Jackman took over the family hotel business, also taking on the role of president of the Bath Hoteliers' and Restaurateurs' Association for 40 years, while still keeping in touch with his military roots. From the mid-1950s to mid-1960s he was producer and director of the Bath Tattoo <ref>[http://www.thisisbath.co.uk/shareholder-hoped-Bath-Rec-safe-hands/story-11342930-detail/story.html Reference to Bath Tattoo]</ref> and also the Wembley Military Pageant and Cardiff Searchlight Tattoo.

He was then later permitted to join the Somerset Light Infantry as an officer in February 1941, rising to the rank of Major. Jackman's military postings included Egypt, Palestine, Lebanon, Greece, Italy and Austria. He became heavily involved in organising entertainment for the troops, and ended his Army career in 1947, have been demobilised without ever having to fire a shot in anger.\n\nOn his return to England, Jackman took over the family hotel business, also taking on the role of president of the Bath Hoteliers' and Restaurateurs' Association for 40 years, while still keeping in touch with his military roots.

He sprung across the blood-stained boards upon his swooning, sweating, strapped-down patient like a duelist, calling, 'Time me gentlemen, time me!' to students craning with pocket watches from the iron-railinged galleries. Everyone swore that the first flash of his knife was followed so swiftly by the rasp of saw on bone that sight and sound seemed simultaneous. To free both hands, he would clasp the bloody knife between his teeth.<ref name=\"RichardGordonp1\" />\n</blockquote>\n\nGordon's prose is more than just caricature. He describes how the link between surgical hygiene and iatrogenic infection was poorly understood at that time. At an address by [[Oliver Wendell Holmes Sr.|Dr Oliver Wendell Holmes]] to the [[Boston Society for Medical Improvement]] on 13 February 1843, his suggestions for hygiene improvement to reduce obstetric infections and mortality from [[Puerperal fever#Prevention via hygienic measures|puerperal fever]] \"outraged obstetricians, particularly in Philadelphia\".<ref name=\"GordononMotherhood\">{{Cite book |title=Great Medical Disasters |last=Gordon |first=Richard |publisher=House of Stratus |year=2001 |location=London |pages=34\u201336 |chapter=Disastrous Motherhood: Tales from the Vienna Wards}} (p.&nbsp;43 of pp.&nbsp;43\u201346 in 1983 edition)</ref>{{efn|name=pagination}}<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Holmes, O.W. |year=1842\u20131843 |title=On the contagiousness of puerperal fever |journal=New England Quarterly Journal of Medicine. |volume=i |pages=503\u201330}} in Gordon, R. (1983), p.147.</ref> In those days, \"surgeons operated in blood-stiffened frock coats \u2013 the stiffer the coat, the prouder the busy surgeon\", \"pus was as inseparable from surgery as blood\", and \"Cleanliness was next to prudishness\". He quotes [[Sir Frederick Treves, 1st Baronet|Sir Frederick Treves]] on that era: \"There was no object in being clean...Indeed, cleanliness was out of place. It was considered to be finicking and affected. An executioner might as well manicure his nails before chopping off a head\".<ref name=\"GordononMotherhood3544\">Gordon, Richard (2001) p.35; (1983) p.44</ref> Indeed, the connection between surgical hygiene, infection, and maternal mortality rates at [[Vienna General Hospital]] was only made in 1847 by Vienna physician [[Ignaz Semmelweis|Dr Ignaz Philipp Semmelweis]] from Hungary, after a close colleague of his died. He instituted the hygiene practices exhorted by Holmes, and the mortality rate fell.<ref name=\"GordononMotherhood34-36&43-45\">Gordon, Richard (2001) pp.34\u201336; (1983) pp.43\u201345</ref>\n\nSuch was the era in which Liston lived. Gordon states that Liston was \"an abrupt, abrasive, argumentative man, unfailingly charitable to the poor and tender to the sick (who) was vilely unpopular to his fellow surgeons at the Edinburgh Royal Infirmary. He relished operating successfully in the reeking tenements of the [[Grassmarket]] and [[Lawnmarket]] on patients they had discharged as hopelessly incurable. They conspired to bar him from the wards, banished him south, where he became professor of surgery at University College Hospital and made a fortune\".<ref name=\"RichardGordonp2\">Gordon, Richard (2001), p.2</ref>\n\nIn writings on Liston, he is portrayed as a man of strong character and ethics, which was the source of some of his confrontational style. In one case, he confronted a medical colleague ([[Robert Knox|Dr Robert Knox]]) over the treatment of a young woman (Mary Paterson) who it later transpired was murdered (see [[Burke and Hare murders]]), with Knox thought complicit in the murder. She was in Knox's dissecting rooms within four hours of her death, and kept in whisky for three months before dissection, during which time she was essentially on voyeuristic display.<ref name=\"Richardson1987\">{{Citation |last=Richardson, Ruth |title=Death, Dissection and the Destitute |pages=131\u2013158 |year=1987 |chapter=Trading Assassins |chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=m4cOAAAAQAAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=%22death+dissection%22&hl=en&ei=ZclATPmMM47-vQOr4oz4DA&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=1&ved=0CC8Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&q&f=false |place=London |publisher=Routledge & Kegan Paul |isbn=978-0-7102-0919-1 |access-date=16 July 2010}}</ref> Liston's response is documented in a letter from him<blockquote>According to Liston, he saw Mary Paterson's body in Knox's rooms and immediately suspected foul play.

Gordon describes Liston's four most famous cases in his book, as quoted verbatim below.\n\n;Fourth most famous case:\n{{quote|Removal in 4 minutes of a 45-pound scrotal tumour, whose owner had to carry it round in a wheelbarrow.|Richard Gordon<ref name=\"RichardGordonp2\" />}}\n\n;Third most famous case:\n{{quote|\nArgument with his house-surgeon. Was the red, pulsating tumour in a small boy's neck a straightforward abscess of the skin, or a dangerous aneurism of the carotid artery? 'Pooh!' Liston exclaimed impatiently. 'Whoever heard of an aneurism in one so young?' Flashing a knife from his waistcoat pocket, he lanced it. Houseman's note \u2013 'Out leaped arterial blood, and the boy fell.' The patient died but the artery lives, in University College Hospital pathology museum, specimen No. 1256.\n|Richard Gordon<ref name=\"RichardGordonp2\" />}}\n\n;Second most famous case:\n{{quote|Amputated the leg in 2{{frac|1|2}} minutes, but in his enthusiasm the patient's testicles as well.|Richard Gordon<ref name=\"RichardGordonp2\" />}}\n\n;Liston's most famous case:\n{{quote|\nAmputated the leg in under 2{{frac|1|2}} minutes (the patient died afterwards in the ward from hospital gangrene; they usually did in those [[Joseph Lister, 1st Baron Lister#Antiseptics|pre-Listerian]] days). He amputated in addition the fingers of his young assistant (who died afterwards in the ward from hospital gangrene). He also slashed through the coat tails of a distinguished surgical spectator, who was so terrified that the knife had pierced his vitals he dropped dead from fright.\n\nThat was the only operation in history with a 300 percent mortality.\n|Richard Gordon<ref name=\"RichardGordon15\">Gordon, Richard (2001), p.3;(1983), p.15</ref><!--Note: This is a verbatim quote.

He sprung across the blood-stained boards upon his swooning, sweating, strapped-down patient like a duelist, calling, 'Time me gentlemen, time me!' to students craning with pocket watches from the iron-railinged galleries. Everyone swore that the first flash of his knife was followed so swiftly by the rasp of saw on bone that sight and sound seemed simultaneous. To free both hands, he would clasp the bloody knife between his teeth.<ref name=\"RichardGordonp1\" />\n</blockquote>\n\nGordon's prose is more than just caricature. He describes how the link between surgical hygiene and iatrogenic infection was poorly understood at that time. At an address by [[Oliver Wendell Holmes Sr.|Dr Oliver Wendell Holmes]] to the [[Boston Society for Medical Improvement]] on 13 February 1843, his suggestions for hygiene improvement to reduce obstetric infections and mortality from [[Puerperal fever#Prevention via hygienic measures|puerperal fever]] \"outraged obstetricians, particularly in Philadelphia\".<ref name=\"GordononMotherhood\">{{Cite book |title=Great Medical Disasters |last=Gordon |first=Richard |publisher=House of Stratus |year=2001 |editor-last=\u2026 |location=London |pages=34\u201336 |chapter=Disastrous Motherhood: Tales from the Vienna Wards}} (p.&nbsp;43 of pp.&nbsp;43\u201346 in 1983 edition)</ref>{{efn|name=pagination}}<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Holmes, O.W. |year=1842\u20131843 |title=On the contagiousness of puerperal fever |journal=New England Quarterly Journal of Medicine. |volume=i |pages=503\u201330}} in Gordon, R. (1983), p.147.</ref> In those days, \"surgeons operated in blood-stiffened frock coats \u2013 the stiffer the coat, the prouder the busy surgeon\", \"pus was as inseparable from surgery as blood\", and \"Cleanliness was next to prudishness\". He quotes [[Sir Frederick Treves, 1st Baronet|Sir Frederick Treves]] on that era: \"There was no object in being clean...Indeed, cleanliness was out of place. It was considered to be finicking and affected. An executioner might as well manicure his nails before chopping off a head\".<ref name=\"GordononMotherhood3544\">Gordon, Richard (2001) p.35; (1983) p.44</ref> Indeed, the connection between surgical hygiene, infection, and maternal mortality rates at [[Vienna General Hospital]] was only made in 1847 by Vienna physician [[Ignaz Semmelweis|Dr Ignaz Philipp Semmelweis]] from Hungary, after a close colleague of his died. He instituted the hygiene practices exhorted by Holmes, and the mortality rate fell.<ref name=\"GordononMotherhood34-36&43-45\">Gordon, Richard (2001) pp.34\u201336; (1983) pp.43\u201345</ref>\n\nSuch was the era in which Liston lived. Gordon states that Liston was \"an abrupt, abrasive, argumentative man, unfailingly charitable to the poor and tender to the sick (who) was vilely unpopular to his fellow surgeons at the Edinburgh Royal Infirmary. He relished operating successfully in the reeking tenements of the [[Grassmarket]] and [[Lawnmarket]] on patients they had discharged as hopelessly incurable. They conspired to bar him from the wards, banished him south, where he became professor of surgery at University College Hospital and made a fortune\".<ref name=\"RichardGordonp2\">Gordon, Richard (2001), p.2</ref>\n\nIn writings on Liston, he is portrayed as a man of strong character and ethics, which was the source of some of his confrontational style. In one case, he confronted a medical colleague ([[Robert Knox|Dr Robert Knox]]) over the treatment of a young woman (Mary Paterson) who it later transpired was murdered (see [[Burke and Hare murders]]), with Knox thought complicit in the murder. She was in Knox's dissecting rooms within four hours of her death, and kept in whisky for three months before dissection, during which time she was essentially on voyeuristic display.<ref name=\"Richardson1987\">{{Citation |last=Richardson, Ruth |title=Death, Dissection and the Destitute |pages=131\u2013158 |year=1987 |chapter=Trading Assassins |chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=m4cOAAAAQAAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=%22death+dissection%22&hl=en&ei=ZclATPmMM47-vQOr4oz4DA&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=1&ved=0CC8Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&q&f=false |place=London |publisher=Routledge & Kegan Paul |isbn=978-0-7102-0919-1 |access-date=16 July 2010}}</ref> Liston's response is documented in a letter from him<blockquote>According to Liston, he saw Mary Paterson's body in Knox's rooms and immediately suspected foul play.

Gordon describes Liston's four most famous cases in his book, as quoted verbatim below.\n\n;Fourth most famous case:\n{{quote|Removal in 4 minutes of a 45-pound scrotal tumour, whose owner had to carry it round in a wheelbarrow.|Richard Gordon<ref name=\"RichardGordonp2\" />}}\n\n;Third most famous case:\n{{quote|\nArgument with his house-surgeon. Was the red, pulsating tumour in a small boy's neck a straightforward abscess of the skin, or a dangerous aneurism of the carotid artery? 'Pooh!' Liston exclaimed impatiently. 'Whoever heard of an aneurism in one so young?' Flashing a knife from his waistcoat pocket, he lanced it. Houseman's note \u2013 'Out leaped arterial blood, and the boy fell.' The patient died but the artery lives, in University College Hospital pathology museum, specimen No. 1256.\n|Richard Gordon<ref name=\"RichardGordonp2\" />}}\n\n;Second most famous case:\n{{quote|Amputated the leg in 2{{frac|1|2}} minutes, but in his enthusiasm the patient's testicles as well.|Richard Gordon<ref name=\"RichardGordonp2\" />}}\n\n;Liston's most famous case:\n{{quote|\nAmputated the leg in under 2{{frac|1|2}} minutes (the patient died afterwards in the ward from hospital gangrene; they usually did in those [[Joseph Lister, 1st Baron Lister#Antiseptics|pre-Listerian]] days). He amputated in addition the fingers of his young assistant (who died afterwards in the ward from hospital gangrene). He also slashed through the coat tails of a distinguished surgical spectator, who was so terrified that the knife had pierced his vitals he dropped dead from fright.\n\nThat was the only operation in history with a 300 percent mortality.\n|Richard Gordon<ref name=\"RichardGordon15\">Gordon, Richard (2001), p.3;(1983), p.15</ref><!--Note: This is a verbatim quote. While I do make typos here and there, this is not one of them--><!--Maybe, but I still don't believe it! Too good to be true!-->\n}}\n\n;Veracity:\n\nDoubts have been raised as to the veracity of these cases. The situation that Gordon labels \"Liston's most famous case\" may be apocryphal.<ref>{{Cite news |url=https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2012/10/time-me-gentlemen-the-fastest-surgeon-of-the-19th-century/264065/ |title='Time Me, Gentlemen': The Fastest Surgeon of the 19th Century |last=Soniak |first=Matt |date=Oct 24, 2012 |work=Mental Floss |access-date=30 April 2019 |publisher=The Atlantic}}</ref>\n\n==Publications by Liston==\n*{{Citation |title=Cases of Aneurism; Fracture of the Femur; Case of Aneurism |url=https://books.google.com/?id=IM0EAAAAQAAJ&pg=PA66&dq=%22robert+liston%22#v=onepage&q=%22robert%20liston%22&f=false |work=The Edinburgh Medical and Surgical Journal |volume=16 |pages=66\u201374, 212\u2013215, 348\u2013352 |year=1820 |access-date=16 July 2010}}\n*{{Citation |title=Spontaneous Mortification \u2013 Case occurring in the upper extremity |date=14 March 1835 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=nRpAAAAAcAAJ&pg=PA846&dq=%22robert+liston%22+%22lecture+IX%22#v=onepage&q=%22robert%20liston%22%20%22lecture%20IX%22&f=false |work=[[The Lancet]] |volume=1 |issue=602 |pages=846\u2013851 |series=Lectures Delivered at the North London Hospital, by Robert Liston, Esq., Lecture IX |doi=10.1016/s0140-6736(02)96871-6 |access-date=18 July 2010}}\n*{{Citation |last=Liston |first=R. |title=Observations on Some Tumours of The Mouth and Jaws |work=Medico-Chirurgical Transactions |volume=20 |pages=165\u2013199 |year=1837 |doi=10.1177/095952873702000112 |pmc=2116728 |pmid=20895635}} [https://books.google.com/books?id=1xgCAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA165&dq=%22robert+liston%22&hl=en&ei=lAFATP3bLoudcdXzpaMP&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=9&ved=0CEwQ6AEwCA#v=onepage&q=%22robert%20liston%22&f=false Also via Google books] (Note: The volume listing for Google is incorrect, as evidenced by the first page which clearly states \"volume the twentieth\").\n*{{Cite book |url=https://archive.org/details/practicalsurger00listgoog |title=Practical Surgery, with One Hundred and Twenty Engravings on Wood. |publisher=John Churchill & Henry Renshaw |year=1837 |location=London |access-date=24 October 2009}} Full text at Internet Archive (archive.org)\n*{{Cite book |url=https://archive.org/details/practicalsurgery00listuoft |title=Practical Surgery, with Notes and Additional Illustrations by George W.

Between October 1976 and February 15, 1977, the ''Lone Star'' was combined with the ''[[Southwest Chief|Southwest Limited]]'' (Chicago-Los Angeles) between Chicago and Kansas City, temporarily eliminating the Dallas through cars.<ref>{{Harvnb|Goldberg|1981|pp=60\u201361}}</ref>\n[[File:Guthrie Station - ATSF.jpg|left|thumb|Guthrie station in February&nbsp;2017]]\n=== Current status of route ===\n* Amtrak's ''[[Southwest Chief]]'' serves the portion of the original route from Chicago to [[Newton, Kansas]]. \n* In April 2016, Amtrak restored service, via bus shuttle, in both directions between Newton, Kansas and Oklahoma City with a connection in [[Wichita, Kansas]].<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.kansas.com/news/local/article72464132.html| title=Amtrak restores service to Wichita with shuttle to Newton and OKC stations| website=The Wichita Eagle| date=April 18, 2016| first=Dion| last=Lefler}}</ref>\n* Since 1999, Amtrak's Oklahoma City to Fort Worth ''[[Heartland Flyer]]'' serves that part of the route.  \n* Amtrak's [[Texas Eagle]] currently connects Chicago with Dallas, but using a different route.\n\nOf the original Texas Chief/Lone Star route, only sections from Newton, Kansas, to Oklahoma City, and Temple, Texas to Houston and Galveston remain without passenger train service as of 2012.\n\n== Equipment ==\nDuring the period in 1976\u20131977 when the ''Lone Star'' combined with the ''Southwest Chief'' between Chicago and Kansas City, the ''Lone Star'' carried two baggage cars, two [[Hi-Level]] coaches, a dormitory bar-lounge, an ex-Santa Fe dining car, two 10-roomette 6-bedroom ''Pine''-series sleeping cars<!-- Do not link Pine-series (railcar); different type-->, and a 48-seat single-level coach.
