In the early 1960s, a system of legal discrimination, known as [[Jim Crow laws]], were pervasive in the [[Southern United States|American South]], ensuring that African-Americans remained oppressed. They also experienced discrimination from businesses and governments, and in some places were prevented from voting through intimidation and violence.<ref>Bass, ''Like a Mighty Stream'' (2002), pp. 31, 34\u201336.</ref> Twenty-one states prohibited [[interracial marriage]].<ref>Euchner, ''Nobody Turn Me Around'' (2010), p. 128.</ref>\n\nThe impetus for a march on Washington developed over a long period of time, and earlier efforts to organize such a demonstration included the [[March on Washington Movement]] of the 1940s.

In the South after 1960, the widespread adoption of direct action\u2014purposeful defiance of segregation laws and injunctions against demonstrations\u2014inspired activists and attracted new attention from the media, the federal government, and white segregationists.\"</ref> 1963 also marked the 100th anniversary of the signing of the [[Emancipation Proclamation]] by [[Abraham Lincoln]]. Members of The [[National Association for the Advancement of Colored People]] (NAACP), and the [[Southern Christian Leadership Conference]] put aside their differences and came together for the march. Many whites and blacks also came together in the urgency for change in the nation.\n\nViolent confrontations broke out in the South: in Cambridge, Maryland; Pine Bluff, Arkansas; Goldsboro, North Carolina; Somerville, Tennessee; Saint Augustine, Florida; and across Mississippi. Most of these incidents involved white people retaliating against nonviolent demonstrators.<ref>Euchner, ''Nobody Turn Me Around'' (2010), p. xvi. \"Violence swept the South all year. Vigilantes in Clarksdale firebombed the home of Aaron Henry, the head of Mississippi's NAACP. After a gas bomb went off in a church in Itta Bena, Mississippi, mobs threw bottles and rocks at activists spilling onto the streets. Vigilantes shot into the home of college professors helping the movement in Jackson. A civil rights worker traveling from Itta Bena to Jackson was shot in the neck and shoulder. A bomb destroyed a two-family home in Jackson. Whites in the North Carolina town of Goldsboro ran down demonstrators in a car and threw bottles and rocks. Whites in Pine Bluff, in Arkansas, attacked civil rights workers with ammonia and bottles. Someone shot into the home of an NAACP board member in Saint Augustine. When nine activists prayed in a country courthouse in Somerville, Tennessee, police allowed hoodlums into the building to beat them up.\"</ref> Many people wanted to march on Washington, but disagreed over how the march should be conducted. Some called for a complete shutdown of the city through [[civil disobedience]]. Others argued that the movement should remain nationwide in scope, rather than focus its energies on the nation's capital.<ref>Euchner, ''Nobody Turn Me Around'' (2010), p. 2.</ref> There was a widespread perception that the [[Presidency of John F. Kennedy|Kennedy administration]] had not lived up to its promises in the 1960 election, and King described Kennedy's race policy as \"tokenism\".<ref name=Bartlett />\n\nOn May 24, 1963, Attorney General [[Robert F. Kennedy]] invited African-American novelist [[James Baldwin]], along with a large group of cultural leaders, to a meeting in New York to discuss race relations. However, the meeting became antagonistic, as black delegates felt that Kennedy did not have an adequate understanding of the race problem in the nation. The public failure of the meeting, which came to be known as the [[Baldwin\u2013Kennedy meeting]], underscored the divide between the needs of Black America and the understanding of Washington politicians. However, the meeting also provoked the [[Presidency of John F. Kennedy|Kennedy administration]] to take action on the civil rights for African-Americans.<ref>Euchner, ''Nobody Turn Me Around'' (2010), pp. 120\u2013121. \"In the TV interview, Baldwin was ashen, disoriented. He had had no idea, before now, just how aloof the Kennedys appeared. He thought the administration's caution came from ruthless political calculation. But now it seemed that the pampered sons of old Joe Kennedy just had no idea\u2014''no understanding at all''\u2014about race in America. The secret meeting was immediately leaked to the press. Within weeks, the velocity of the civil rights movement would lead President [[John F. Kennedy]] to give the most aggressive presidential address in history on race, which was quickly followed with the most comprehensive legislation in modern history.</ref> On June 11, 1963, President Kennedy gave his famous [[Civil Rights Address|civil rights address]] on national television and radio, announcing that he would begin to push for civil rights legislation\u2014the law which eventually became the [[Civil Rights Act of 1964]]. That night, Mississippi activist [[Medgar Evers]] was murdered in his own driveway, further escalating national tension around the issue of [[racial inequality in the United States|racial inequality]].<ref>Bass, ''Like a Mighty Stream'' (2002), pp. 67\u201369.</ref>\n\n== Planning and organization ==\n[[A. Philip Randolph]] and [[Bayard Rustin]] began planning the march in December 1961. They envisioned two days of protest, including sit-ins and lobbying followed by a mass rally at the Lincoln Memorial. They wanted to focus on joblessness and to call for a public works program that would employ blacks. In early 1963 they called publicly for \"a massive March on Washington for jobs\".<ref>Barber, ''Marching on Washington'' (2002), p. 144.</ref> They received help from [[Amalgamated Clothing Workers]] unionist [[Stanley Aronowitz]], who gathered support from radical organizers who could be trusted not to report their plans to the Kennedy administration. The unionists offered tentative support for a march that would be focused on jobs.<ref>Euchner, ''Nobody Turn Me Around'' (2010), p. 17. \"By going to the old Communists and socialists, Arnowitz later recalled, Rustin hoped to 'outflank Kennedy's labor connections' and King's moderate, nonviolent SCLC. If Rustin went to Kennedy's backers, they would report to the president. Later, in fact, when United Auto Workers joined the march effort, UAW people fed inside intelligence to the White House. In the earliest planning stages, in 1962, it was better to steer clear of Kennedy's financial and political network.\"</ref>\n\nOn May 15, 1963, without securing the cooperation of the NAACP or the Urban League, Randolph announced an \"October Emancipation March on Washington for Jobs\".<ref>Euchner, ''Nobody Turn Me Around'' (2010), p. 20.</ref> He reached out to union leaders, winning the support of the UAW's [[Walter Reuther]], but not of [[AFL\u2013CIO]] president [[George Meany]].<ref name=Euchner21>Euchner, ''Nobody Turn Me Around'' (2010), p. 21.</ref> Randolph and Rustin intended to focus the March on economic inequality, stating in their original plan that \"integration in the fields of education, housing, transportation and public accommodations will be of limited extent and duration so long as fundamental economic inequality along racial lines persists.\"<ref>[[David J.

The civil rights activists insisted on holding the march. Wilkins pushed for the organizers to rule out [[civil disobedience]] and described this proposal as the \"perfect compromise\". King and Young agreed. Leaders from the [[Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee]] (SNCC) and [[Congress of Racial Equality]] (CORE), who wanted to conduct direct actions against the Department of Justice, endorsed the protest before they were informed that civil disobedience would not be allowed.

Rustin was a long-time associate of both Randolph and Dr. King. With Randolph concentrating on building the march's political coalition, Rustin built and led the team of two hundred activists and organizers who publicized the march and recruited the marchers, coordinated the buses and trains, provided the marshals, and set up and administered all of the logistic details of a mass march in the nation's capital.{{sfn|Branch|1988|p=872}}  During the days leading up to the march, these 200 volunteers used the ballroom of Washington DC radio station [[WUST]] as their operations headquarters.<ref>Euchner, Charles, \"Nobody Turn Me Around: A People's History of the 1963 March on Washington\", 2010.</ref>\n\nThe march was not universally supported among civil rights activists. Some, including Rustin (who assembled 4,000 volunteer marshals from New York), were concerned that it might turn violent, which could undermine pending legislation and damage the international image of the movement.{{sfn|Branch|1988|p=871}} The march was condemned by [[Malcolm X]], spokesperson for the [[Nation of Islam]], who termed it the \"farce on Washington\".{{sfn|Branch|1988|p=874}}\n\nMarch organizers themselves disagreed over the purpose of the march. The NAACP and Urban League saw it as a gesture of support for a civil rights bill that had been introduced by the [[John F. Kennedy|Kennedy]] Administration. Randolph, King, and the [[Southern Christian Leadership Conference]] (SCLC) saw it as a way of raising both civil rights and economic issues to national attention beyond the Kennedy bill.

Every now and then, people on the bus sang 'Oh Freedom' and 'We Shall Overcome,' but for the most part there wasn't a whole bunch of singing.

As the first ceremony of such magnitude ever initiated and dominated by African Americans, the march also was the first to have its nature wholly misperceived in advance.

According to biographer [[Thomas C.

In his section ''The March on Washington and Television News'', William Thomas notes: \"Over five hundred cameramen, technicians, and correspondents from the major networks were set to cover the event. More cameras would be set up than had filmed the last Presidential inauguration. One camera was positioned high in the Washington Monument, to give dramatic vistas of the marchers\".<ref>{{cite journal|url=http://southernspaces.org/2004/television-news-and-civil-rights-struggle-views-virginia-and-mississippi#section6|title=Television News and the Civil Rights Struggle: The Views in Virginia and Mississippi|first=Thomas, William|last=G|date=28 August 2018|publisher=|volume=2004}}</ref> The major networks broadcast some of the March live, though they interspersed footage of interviews with politicians.

The [[United States Information Agency]] organized a press conference for the benefit of foreign journalists, and also created a documentary film of the event for distribution to embassies abroad.<ref name=Barber151 /> Commented Michael Thelwell of SNCC: \"So it happened that Negro students from the South, some of whom still had unhealed bruises from the electric cattle prods which Southern police used to break up demonstrations, were recorded for the screens of the world portraying 'American Democracy at Work.'\"<ref>Euchner, ''Nobody Turn Me Around'' (2010), p. 70.</ref>\n\n==Responses and memories==\n\n=== Organizers ===\nAlthough the mass media generally declared the March successful because of its high turnout, organizers were not confident that it would create change. Randolph and Rustin abandoned their belief in the effectiveness of marching on Washington. King maintained faith that action in Washington could work, but determined that future marchers would need to call greater attention to economic injustice. In 1967\u20131968, he organized a [[Poor People's Campaign]] to occupy the National Mall with a shantytown.<ref name=Barber167>Barber, ''Marching on Washington'' (2002), pp. 176\u2013178.</ref>\n\n===Critics===\n[[Black nationalism|Black nationalist]] [[Malcolm X]], in his [[Message to the Grass Roots]] speech, criticized the march, describing it as \"a picnic\" and \"a circus\". He said the civil rights leaders had diluted the original purpose of the march, which had been to show the strength and anger of black people, by allowing white people and organizations to help plan and participate in the march.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Malcolm X |authorlink=Malcolm X |editor=George Breitman |title=Malcolm X Speaks |origyear=1965 |year=1990 |publisher=Grove Weidenfeld |location=New York |isbn=0-8021-3213-8 |pages=[https://archive.org/details/malcolmxspeaksse00xmal/page/14 14\u201317] |url=https://archive.org/details/malcolmxspeaksse00xmal/page/14 }}</ref> One SNCC staffer commented during the march, \"He's denouncing us as clowns, but he's right there with the clown show.\"<ref>Euchner, ''Nobody Turn Me Around'' (2010), pp. 16.</ref> But the membership of SNCC, increasingly frustrated with the tactics of the NAACP and other moderate groups, gradually embraced Malcolm X's position.<ref name=Barber167 />\n\nSegregationists including [[William Jennings Bryan Dorn]] criticized the government for cooperating with the civil rights activists.<ref>Barber, ''Marching on Washington'' (2002), p. 153. \"Segregationists and black nationalists launched scathing criticisms of the Kennedy administration for its support. For rabid segregationist Representative W.J. Bryan Dorn, a Democrat from South Carolina, the absurdity was that 'for the first time in the history of our Nation ... the Federal government has itself encouraged a \"march on Washington.\"'\"</ref> Senator [[Olin D. Johnston]] rejected an invitation to attend, writing: \"You are committing the worst possible mistake in promoting this March. You should know that criminal, fanatical, and communistic elements, as well as crackpots, will move in to take every advantage of this mob. You certainly will have no influence on any member of Congress, including myself.\"<ref>Bass, ''Like a Mighty Stream'' (2002), p. 95.</ref>\n\n=== Participants ===\n[[File:Civil Rights March on Washington, D.C. (Leaders of the march leading marchers down the street.) - NARA - 542003.tif|thumb|Leaders of the march leading marchers down the street]]\nMany participants said they felt the March was a historic and life-changing experience. Nan Grogan Orrock, a student at Mary Washington College, said: \"You couldn't help but get swept up in the feeling of the March. It was an incredible experience of this mass of humanity with one mind moving down the street. It was like being part of a glacier. You could feel the sense of collective will and effort in the air.\"<ref>Bass, ''Like a Mighty Stream'' (2002), p. 142.</ref>  SNCC organizer Bob Zellner reported that the event \"provided dramatic proof that the sometimes quiet and always dangerous work we did in the Deep South had had a profound national impact. The spectacle of a quarter of a million supporters and activists gave me an assurance that the work I was in the process of dedicating my life to was worth doing.\"<ref>Bass, ''Like a Mighty Stream'' (2002), p. 38.</ref>\n\nRichard Brown, then a white graduate student at Harvard University, recalls that the March fostered direct actions for economic progress: \"Henry Armstrong and I compared notes. I realized the Congress of Racial Equality might help black employment in Boston by urging businesses to hire contractors like Armstrong. He agreed to help start a list of reliable contractors that CORE could promote. It was a modest effort \u2014 but it moved in the right direction.\"<ref>Richard D. Brown, \"[http://articles.courant.com/2013-08-16/news/hc-op-march-on-washington-50-years-ago-20130816_1_washington-monument-henry-armstrong-congress March On Washington Was Day To Remember \u2014 And Relive The Bus, Henry Armstrong \u2014 And The Work Left Undone]\"; ''Hartford Courant'', 16 August 2013.</ref>\n\nOther participants, more sympathetic to Malcolm X and the black nationalists, expressed ambivalence. One marcher from New York explained:<ref>Euchner, ''Nobody Turn Me Around'' (2010), pp. 24\u201325.</ref>\n\n<blockquote>It's like [[St Patrick's Day]]. I came out of respect for what my people are doing, not because I believe it will do any good. I thought it would do some good in the beginning. But when the march started to get all the official approval from ''Mastah'' Kennedy, ''Mastah'' Wagner, ''Mastah'' Spellman, and they started setting limits on how we had to march peacefully, I knew that the march was going to be a mockery, that ''they'' were giving ''us'' something again.</blockquote>\n\nMarcher Beverly Alston thought that the day had its greatest impact within the movement: \"Culturally, there has been tremendous progress over the past forty years. Black awareness and self-determination has soared. Politically, I just don't think we've made enough progress.\"<ref>Bass, ''Like a Mighty Stream'' (2002), p. 72.</ref> Fifteen-year-old Ericka Jenkins from Washington said:<ref>Euchner, ''Nobody Turn Me Around'' (2010), pp. 81\u201382.</ref>\n\n<blockquote>I saw people laughing and listening and standing very close to one another, almost in an embrace. Children of every size, pregnant women, elderly people who seemed tired but happy to be there, clothing that made me know that they struggled to make it day to day, made me know they worked in farms or offices or even nearby for the government. I didn't see teenagers alone; I saw groups of teenagers with teachers. <br />\nWhite people [were] standing in wonder. Their eyes were open, they were ''listening''. Openness and nothing on guard\u2014I saw that in everybody. I was so happy to see that in the white people that they could listen and take in and respect and believe in the words of a black person. I had never seen anything like that.</blockquote>\n\nSome people discussed racism becoming less explicit after the March. Reverend Abraham Woods of Birmingham commented: \"Everything has changed. And when you look at it, nothing has changed. Racism is under the surface, and an incident that could scratch it, can bring it out.\"<ref>Bass, ''Like a Mighty Stream'' (2002), p. 101.</ref>\n\n== Effects and legacy ==\nThe symbolism of the March has been contested since before it even took place. In the years following the March, movement radicals increasingly subscribed to Malcolm X's narrative of the March as a co-optation by the white establishment. Liberals and conservatives tended to embrace the March, but focused mostly on King's \"I Have a Dream\" speech and the legislative successes of 1964 and 1965.<ref name=JonesDissent>William P. Jones, \"[http://www.dissentmagazine.org/article/the-forgotten-radical-history-of-the-march-on-washington The Forgotten Radical History of the March on Washington]\"; ''Dissent'', Spring 2013.</ref>\n\nThe mass media identified King's speech as a highlight of the event and focused on this oration to the exclusion of other aspects. For several decades, King took center stage in narratives about the March. More recently, historians and commentators have acknowledged the role played by Bayard Rustin in organizing the event.<ref name=Wickham>DeWayne Wickham, \"[https://archive.is/20130817164951/http://www.guampdn.com/article/20130815/OPINION02/308150017/Rustin-finally-getting-due-recognition Rustin finally getting due recognition]\"; ''Pacific Daily News'', 15 August 2013.</ref>\n\n=== Political effects ===\nSoon after the speakers ended their meetings with Congress to go join the March, both houses passed legislation to create a dispute arbitration board for striking railroad workers.<ref>Euchner, ''Nobody Turn Me Around'' (2010), p. 89</ref>\n\nThe March is credited with propelling the U.S. government into action on civil rights, creating political momentum for the [[Civil Rights Act of 1964]] and the [[Voting Rights Act]] of 1965.<ref name=Bartlett>Bruce Bartlett, \"[http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Columns/2013/08/09/The-1963-March-on-Washington-Changed-Politics-Forever.aspx#page1 The 1963 March on Washington Changed Politics Forever]\"; ''The Fiscal Times'', 9 August 2013.</ref>\n\nThe cooperation of a Democratic administration with the issue of civil rights marked a pivotal moment in voter alignment within the U.S. The [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]] gave up the [[Solid South]]\u2014its undivided support since Reconstruction among the segregated Southern states\u2014and went on to capture a high proportion of votes from blacks from the Republicans.<ref name=Bartlett /><ref>Bruce Bartlett, \"[http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Columns/2013/08/16/How-the-March-on-Washington-Flipped-the-Southern-Vote.aspx#page1 How the March on Washington Flipped the Southern Vote]\"; ''Fiscal Times'', 16 August 1963.</ref>\n\n=== Anniversary marches ===\n[[File:Walking in to the march 2 - 50th Anniversary of the Civil Rights March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom.jpg|thumb|right|175px|50th Anniversary of the Civil Rights March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom]]\n\nThe 1963 March also spurred anniversary marches that occur every five years, with the 20th and 25th being some of the most well known.  The 25th Anniversary theme was \"We Still have a Dream ... Jobs*Peace*Freedom.\"<ref>Barber, ''Marching on Washington'' (2002), pp. 173\u2013174.</ref>\n\nAt the 50th anniversary march in 2013, President [[Barack Obama]] conferred a posthumous [[Presidential Medal of Freedom]] on Bayard Rustin and 15 others.<ref name=JonesDissent /><ref name=Wickham />\n\n==Postal stamp==\nFor the 50th Anniversary, the [[United States Postal Service]] released a [[forever stamp]] that commemorates the 1963 March on Washington,  ([[Washington Monument|WashingtonMonument]])\n\n=== Issues ===\nIn 2013, the [[Economic Policy Institute]] launched a series of reports around the theme of \"The Unfinished March\". These reports analyze the goals of the original march and assess how much progress has been made.<ref>\"King's unfinished work\", ''Philadelphia Inquirer'', 16 August 2013.</ref><ref>Freddie Allen, \"Upcoming Washington March should again focus on jobs\", ''Madison Times'' (NNPA), 14 August 2013.</ref> They echo the message of Randolph and Rustin that civil rights cannot transform people's quality of life unless accompanied by economic justice. They contend that many of the March's primary goals\u2014including housing, integrated education, and widespread employment at living wages\u2014have not been accomplished. They further argued that although legal advances were made, black people still live in concentrated areas of poverty (\"ghettoes\"), where they receive inferior education and suffer from widespread unemployment.<ref>Algernon Austin, \"[http://www.epi.org/publication/unfinished-march-overview/ The Unfinished March: An Overview]\"; [[Economic Policy Institute]] Report, 18 June 2013.</ref>\n\nDedrick Muhammad of the NAACP writes that racial inequality of income and homeownership have increased since 1963 and worsened during the recent [[Great Recession]].<ref>Dedrick Muhammad, \"[http://www.huffingtonpost.com/dedrick-muhammad/50-years-after-the-march-_1_b_3749897.html 50 Years After the March On Washington: The Economic Impacts on Education]\"; ''Huffington Post'', 13 August 2013.</ref>\n{{clear}}\n\n==Gallery==\n<div align=center>\n<gallery widths=\"140\" heights=\"180\">\nFile:Poitier Belafonte Heston Civil Rights March 1963.jpg|[[Sidney Poitier]], [[Harry Belafonte]] and [[Charlton Heston]]\nFile:Civil Rights March on Washington, D.C.

In the early 1960s, a system of legal discrimination, known as [[Jim Crow laws]], were pervasive in the [[Southern United States|American South]], ensuring that African-Americans remained oppressed. They also experienced discrimination from businesses and governments, and in some places were prevented from voting through intimidation and violence.<ref>Bass, ''Like a Mighty Stream'' (2002), pp. 31, 34\u201336.</ref> Twenty-one states prohibited [[interracial marriage]].<ref>Euchner, ''Nobody Turn Me Around'' (2010), p. 128.</ref>\n\nThe impetus for a march on Washington developed over a long period of time, and earlier efforts to organize such a demonstration included the [[March on Washington Movement]] of the 1940s. [[A. Philip Randolph]]\u2014the president of the [[Brotherhood of Sleeping Car Porters]], president of the Negro American Labor Council,<ref name=WDL>{{cite web|title=Civil Rights March on Washington, D.C.: Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., President of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference, and Mathew Ahmann, Executive Director of the National Catholic Conference for Interracial Justice, in a Crowd|url=http://www.wdl.org/en/item/2738/|publisher=[[World Digital Library]]|accessdate=10 February 2013}}</ref> and vice president of the [[AFL-CIO]]\u2014was a key instigator in 1941. With [[Bayard Rustin]], Randolph called for 100,000 black workers to march on Washington,<ref name=\"Veterans\"/> in protest of discriminatory hiring by [[List of United States defense contractors|U.S. military contractors]] and demanding an [[Executive order (United States)|Executive Order]].<ref>Bass, ''Like a Mighty Stream'' (2002), pp. 44\u201346.</ref> Faced with a mass march scheduled for July 1, 1941, [[President of the United States|President]] [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] issued [[Executive Order 8802]] on June 25.<ref>Bass, ''Like a Mighty Stream'' (2002), pp. 49\u201351.</ref> The order established the [[Committee on Fair Employment Practice]] and banned discriminatory hiring in the defense industry.<ref>Neil A.

They envisioned several large marches during the 1940s, but all were called off (despite criticism from Rustin).<ref>Euchner, ''Nobody Turn Me Around'' (2010), pp. 16\u201317.</ref> Their [[Prayer Pilgrimage for Freedom]], held at the Lincoln Memorial on May 17, 1957, featured key leaders including [[Adam Clayton Powell Jr.|Adam Clayton Powell]], [[Martin Luther King Jr.]], and [[Roy Wilkins]]. [[Mahalia Jackson]] performed.<ref>Bass, ''Like a Mighty Stream'' (2002), p. 75.</ref>\n\nThe 1963 march was an important part of the rapidly expanding [[Civil Rights Movement]], which involved demonstrations and [[nonviolent direct action]] across the United States.<ref>Barber, ''Marching on Washington'' (2002), p. 142. \"In 1963, however, the March on Washington was but one aspect of a national explosion of actions against racial discrimination that many criticized as being outside traditional politics. ... In the South after 1960, the widespread adoption of direct action\u2014purposeful defiance of segregation laws and injunctions against demonstrations\u2014inspired activists and attracted new attention from the media, the federal government, and white segregationists.\"</ref> 1963 also marked the 100th anniversary of the signing of the [[Emancipation Proclamation]] by [[Abraham Lincoln]]. Members of The [[National Association for the Advancement of Colored People]] (NAACP), and the [[Southern Christian Leadership Conference]] put aside their differences and came together for the march. Many whites and blacks also came together in the urgency for change in the nation.\n\nViolent confrontations broke out in the South: in Cambridge, Maryland; Pine Bluff, Arkansas; Goldsboro, North Carolina; Somerville, Tennessee; Saint Augustine, Florida; and across Mississippi. Most of these incidents involved white people retaliating against nonviolent demonstrators.<ref>Euchner, ''Nobody Turn Me Around'' (2010), p. xvi. \"Violence swept the South all year. Vigilantes in Clarksdale firebombed the home of Aaron Henry, the head of Mississippi's NAACP. After a gas bomb went off in a church in Itta Bena, Mississippi, mobs threw bottles and rocks at activists spilling onto the streets. Vigilantes shot into the home of college professors helping the movement in Jackson. A civil rights worker traveling from Itta Bena to Jackson was shot in the neck and shoulder. A bomb destroyed a two-family home in Jackson. Whites in the North Carolina town of Goldsboro ran down demonstrators in a car and threw bottles and rocks. Whites in Pine Bluff, in Arkansas, attacked civil rights workers with ammonia and bottles. Someone shot into the home of an NAACP board member in Saint Augustine. When nine activists prayed in a country courthouse in Somerville, Tennessee, police allowed hoodlums into the building to beat them up.\"</ref> Many people wanted to march on Washington, but disagreed over how the march should be conducted. Some called for a complete shutdown of the city through [[civil disobedience]]. Others argued that the movement should remain nationwide in scope, rather than focus its energies on the nation's capital.<ref>Euchner, ''Nobody Turn Me Around'' (2010), p. 2.</ref> There was a widespread perception that the [[Presidency of John F. Kennedy|Kennedy administration]] had not lived up to its promises in the 1960 election, and King described Kennedy's race policy as \"tokenism\".<ref name=Bartlett />\n\nOn May 24, 1963, Attorney General [[Robert F. Kennedy]] invited African-American novelist [[James Baldwin]], along with a large group of cultural leaders, to a meeting in New York to discuss race relations. However, the meeting became antagonistic, as black delegates felt that Kennedy did not have an adequate understanding of the race problem in the nation. The public failure of the meeting, which came to be known as the [[Baldwin\u2013Kennedy meeting]], underscored the divide between the needs of Black America and the understanding of Washington politicians. However, the meeting also provoked the [[Presidency of John F. Kennedy|Kennedy administration]] to take action on the civil rights for African-Americans.<ref>Euchner, ''Nobody Turn Me Around'' (2010), pp. 120\u2013121. \"In the TV interview, Baldwin was ashen, disoriented. He had had no idea, before now, just how aloof the Kennedys appeared. He thought the administration's caution came from ruthless political calculation. But now it seemed that the pampered sons of old Joe Kennedy just had no idea\u2014''no understanding at all''\u2014about race in America. The secret meeting was immediately leaked to the press. Within weeks, the velocity of the civil rights movement would lead President [[John F. Kennedy]] to give the most aggressive presidential address in history on race, which was quickly followed with the most comprehensive legislation in modern history.</ref> On June 11, 1963, President Kennedy gave his famous [[Civil Rights Address|civil rights address]] on national television and radio, announcing that he would begin to push for civil rights legislation\u2014the law which eventually became the [[Civil Rights Act of 1964]]. That night, Mississippi activist [[Medgar Evers]] was murdered in his own driveway, further escalating national tension around the issue of [[racial inequality in the United States|racial inequality]].<ref>Bass, ''Like a Mighty Stream'' (2002), pp. 67\u201369.</ref>\n\n== Planning and organization ==\n[[A. Philip Randolph]] and [[Bayard Rustin]] began planning the march in December 1961. They envisioned two days of protest, including sit-ins and lobbying followed by a mass rally at the Lincoln Memorial. They wanted to focus on joblessness and to call for a public works program that would employ blacks. In early 1963 they called publicly for \"a massive March on Washington for jobs\".<ref>Barber, ''Marching on Washington'' (2002), p. 144.</ref> They received help from [[Amalgamated Clothing Workers]] unionist [[Stanley Aronowitz]], who gathered support from radical organizers who could be trusted not to report their plans to the Kennedy administration. The unionists offered tentative support for a march that would be focused on jobs.<ref>Euchner, ''Nobody Turn Me Around'' (2010), p. 17. \"By going to the old Communists and socialists, Arnowitz later recalled, Rustin hoped to 'outflank Kennedy's labor connections' and King's moderate, nonviolent SCLC. If Rustin went to Kennedy's backers, they would report to the president. Later, in fact, when United Auto Workers joined the march effort, UAW people fed inside intelligence to the White House. In the earliest planning stages, in 1962, it was better to steer clear of Kennedy's financial and political network.\"</ref>\n\nOn May 15, 1963, without securing the cooperation of the NAACP or the Urban League, Randolph announced an \"October Emancipation March on Washington for Jobs\".<ref>Euchner, ''Nobody Turn Me Around'' (2010), p. 20.</ref> He reached out to union leaders, winning the support of the UAW's [[Walter Reuther]], but not of [[AFL\u2013CIO]] president [[George Meany]].<ref name=Euchner21>Euchner, ''Nobody Turn Me Around'' (2010), p. 21.</ref> Randolph and Rustin intended to focus the March on economic inequality, stating in their original plan that \"integration in the fields of education, housing, transportation and public accommodations will be of limited extent and duration so long as fundamental economic inequality along racial lines persists.\"<ref>[[David J.

The civil rights activists insisted on holding the march. Wilkins pushed for the organizers to rule out [[civil disobedience]] and described this proposal as the \"perfect compromise\". King and Young agreed. Leaders from the [[Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee]] (SNCC) and [[Congress of Racial Equality]] (CORE), who wanted to conduct direct actions against the Department of Justice, endorsed the protest before they were informed that civil disobedience would not be allowed. Finalized plans for the March were announced in a press conference on July 2.<ref>Barber, ''Marching on Washington'' (2002), pp. 147\u2013148.</ref> President Kennedy spoke favorably of the March on July 17, saying that organizers planned a peaceful assembly and had cooperated with the Washington, D.C., police.<ref>Barber, ''Marching on Washington'' (2002), p. 149.</ref>[[File:Civil_Rights_March_on_Washington,_D.C._(Leaders_of_the_march_posing_in_front_of_the_statue_of_Abraham_Lincoln..._-_NARA_-_542063.tif|thumb|350x350px|Civil Rights March on Washington, D.C.

Rustin was a long-time associate of both Randolph and Dr. King. With Randolph concentrating on building the march's political coalition, Rustin built and led the team of two hundred activists and organizers who publicized the march and recruited the marchers, coordinated the buses and trains, provided the marshals, and set up and administered all of the logistic details of a mass march in the nation's capital.{{sfn|Branch|1988|p=872}}  During the days leading up to the march, these 200 volunteers used the ballroom of Washington DC radio station [[WUST]] as their operations headquarters.<ref>Euchner, Charles, \"Nobody Turn Me Around: A People's History of the 1963 March on Washington\", 2010.</ref>\n\nThe march was not universally supported among civil rights activists. Some, including Rustin (who assembled 4,000 volunteer marshals from New York), were concerned that it might turn violent, which could undermine pending legislation and damage the international image of the movement.{{sfn|Branch|1988|p=871}} The march was condemned by [[Malcolm X]], spokesperson for the [[Nation of Islam]], who termed it the \"farce on Washington\".{{sfn|Branch|1988|p=874}}\n\nMarch organizers themselves disagreed over the purpose of the march. The NAACP and Urban League saw it as a gesture of support for a civil rights bill that had been introduced by the [[John F. Kennedy|Kennedy]] Administration. Randolph, King, and the [[Southern Christian Leadership Conference]] (SCLC) saw it as a way of raising both civil rights and economic issues to national attention beyond the Kennedy bill. CORE and SNCC saw it as a way of challenging and condemning the Kennedy administration's inaction and lack of support for civil rights for African Americans.<ref name=\"Veterans\">{{Cite web|title=March on Washington for Jobs & Freedom |url=http://www.crmvet.org/tim/tim63b.htm#1963mow |publisher=Veterans of the Civil Rights Movement}}</ref>\n\nDespite their disagreements, the group came together on a set of goals:\n\n* Passage of meaningful civil rights legislation;\n* Immediate elimination of [[school segregation in the United States|school segregation]];\n* A program of public works, including job training, for the unemployed;\n* A Federal [[anti-discrimination law|law prohibiting discrimination]] in public or private hiring;\n* A $2-an-hour [[minimum wage]] nationwide ({{Inflation|US|2|1963|r=0|fmt=eq}});\n* Withholding Federal funds from programs that tolerate discrimination;\n* Enforcement of the 14th Amendment to the Constitution by reducing congressional representation from States that disenfranchise citizens;\n* A broadened Fair Labor Standards Act to currently excluded employment areas;\n* Authority for the Attorney General to institute injunctive suits when constitutional rights are violated.<ref name=\"fhwa.dot.gov\">{{cite web|url=http://www.fhwa.dot.gov/highwayhistory/road/s33.cfm|title=Getting to the March on Washington, August 28, 1963 - The Road to Civil Rights - Highway History - FHWA<!-- Bot generated title -->|publisher=}}</ref>\n\nAlthough in years past, Randolph had supported \"Negro only\" marches, partly to reduce the impression that the civil rights movement was dominated by white communists, organizers in 1963 agreed that whites and blacks marching side by side would create a more powerful image.<ref>Barber, ''Marching on Washington'' (2002), pp. 156\u2013157.</ref>\n\nThe Kennedy Administration cooperated with the organizers in planning the March, and one member of the Justice Department was assigned as a full-time liaison.<ref name=Barber151>Barber, ''Marching on Washington'' (2002), p. 151.</ref> Chicago and New York City (as well as some corporations) agreed to designate August 28 as \"Freedom Day\" and give workers the day off.<ref name=Barber156 />\n\nTo avoid being perceived as radical, organizers rejected support from Communist groups.

Several senators asked the FBI and Justice Department to respond to these claims, and on July 25, Attorney General Robert Kennedy released a carefully worded statement to the effect that no civil rights leaders were 'Communists or Communist-controlled'.

They gathered early this morning [August 27] in Birmingham's [[Kelly Ingram Park]], where state troopers once [four months previous in May] used fire hoses and dog  to put down their demonstrations. It was peaceful in the Birmingham park as the marchers waited for the buses. The police, now part of a moderate city power structure, directed traffic around the square and did not interfere with the gathering ... An old man commented on the 20-hour ride, which was bound to be less than comfortable: \"You forget we Negroes have been riding buses all our lives. We don't have the money to fly in airplanes.\"</blockquote>\n\nJohn Marshall Kilimanjaro, a demonstrator traveling from Greensboro, North Carolina, said:<ref>Bass, ''Like a Mighty Stream'' (2002), p. 81.</ref>\n\n<blockquote>Contrary to the mythology, the early moments of the March\u2014getting there\u2014was no picnic. People were afraid. We didn't know what we would meet. There was no precedent. Sitting across from me was a black preacher with a white collar. He was an AME preacher. We talked. Every now and then, people on the bus sang 'Oh Freedom' and 'We Shall Overcome,' but for the most part there wasn't a whole bunch of singing. We were secretly praying that nothing violent happened.</blockquote>\n\nOther bus rides featured racial tension, as black activists criticized liberal white participants as fair-weather friends.<ref>Euchner, ''Nobody Turn Me Around'' (2010), p. 25.</ref>\n\nHazel Mangle Rivers, who had paid $8 for her ticket\u2014\"one-tenth of her husband's weekly salary\"\u2014was quoted in the August 29 ''New York Times''.

Why, when I was out there at the march a white man stepped on my foot, and he said, \"Excuse me,\" and I said \"Certainly!\" That's the first time that has ever happened to me.

In his section ''The March on Washington and Television News'', William Thomas notes: \"Over five hundred cameramen, technicians, and correspondents from the major networks were set to cover the event.

Randolph and Rustin abandoned their belief in the effectiveness of marching on Washington. King maintained faith that action in Washington could work, but determined that future marchers would need to call greater attention to economic injustice. In 1967\u20131968, he organized a [[Poor People's Campaign]] to occupy the National Mall with a shantytown.<ref name=Barber167>Barber, ''Marching on Washington'' (2002), pp. 176\u2013178.</ref>\n\n===Critics===\n[[Black nationalism|Black nationalist]] [[Malcolm X]], in his [[Message to the Grass Roots]] speech, criticized the march, describing it as \"a picnic\" and \"a circus\". He said the civil rights leaders had diluted the original purpose of the march, which had been to show the strength and anger of black people, by allowing white people and organizations to help plan and participate in the march.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Malcolm X |authorlink=Malcolm X |editor=George Breitman |title=Malcolm X Speaks |origyear=1965 |year=1990 |publisher=Grove Weidenfeld |location=New York |isbn=0-8021-3213-8 |pages=[https://archive.org/details/malcolmxspeaksse00xmal/page/14 14\u201317] |url=https://archive.org/details/malcolmxspeaksse00xmal/page/14 }}</ref> One SNCC staffer commented during the march, \"He's denouncing us as clowns, but he's right there with the clown show.\"<ref>Euchner, ''Nobody Turn Me Around'' (2010), pp. 16.</ref> But the membership of SNCC, increasingly frustrated with the tactics of the NAACP and other moderate groups, gradually embraced Malcolm X's position.<ref name=Barber167 />\n\nSegregationists including [[William Jennings Bryan Dorn]] criticized the government for cooperating with the civil rights activists.<ref>Barber, ''Marching on Washington'' (2002), p. 153. \"Segregationists and black nationalists launched scathing criticisms of the Kennedy administration for its support. For rabid segregationist Representative W.J. Bryan Dorn, a Democrat from South Carolina, the absurdity was that 'for the first time in the history of our Nation ... the Federal government has itself encouraged a \"march on Washington.\"'\"</ref> Senator [[Olin D. Johnston]] rejected an invitation to attend, writing: \"You are committing the worst possible mistake in promoting this March. You should know that criminal, fanatical, and communistic elements, as well as crackpots, will move in to take every advantage of this mob. You certainly will have no influence on any member of Congress, including myself.\"<ref>Bass, ''Like a Mighty Stream'' (2002), p. 95.</ref>\n\n=== Participants ===\n[[File:Civil Rights March on Washington, D.C. (Leaders of the march leading marchers down the street.) - NARA - 542003.tif|thumb|Leaders of the march leading marchers down the street]]\nMany participants said they felt the March was a historic and life-changing experience. Nan Grogan Orrock, a student at Mary Washington College, said: \"You couldn't help but get swept up in the feeling of the March. It was an incredible experience of this mass of humanity with one mind moving down the street. It was like being part of a glacier. You could feel the sense of collective will and effort in the air.\"<ref>Bass, ''Like a Mighty Stream'' (2002), p. 142.</ref>  SNCC organizer Bob Zellner reported that the event \"provided dramatic proof that the sometimes quiet and always dangerous work we did in the Deep South had had a profound national impact. The spectacle of a quarter of a million supporters and activists gave me an assurance that the work I was in the process of dedicating my life to was worth doing.\"<ref>Bass, ''Like a Mighty Stream'' (2002), p. 38.</ref>\n\nRichard Brown, then a white graduate student at Harvard University, recalls that the March fostered direct actions for economic progress: \"Henry Armstrong and I compared notes. I realized the Congress of Racial Equality might help black employment in Boston by urging businesses to hire contractors like Armstrong. He agreed to help start a list of reliable contractors that CORE could promote. It was a modest effort \u2014 but it moved in the right direction.\"<ref>Richard D. Brown, \"[http://articles.courant.com/2013-08-16/news/hc-op-march-on-washington-50-years-ago-20130816_1_washington-monument-henry-armstrong-congress March On Washington Was Day To Remember \u2014 And Relive The Bus, Henry Armstrong \u2014 And The Work Left Undone]\"; ''Hartford Courant'', 16 August 2013.</ref>\n\nOther participants, more sympathetic to Malcolm X and the black nationalists, expressed ambivalence. One marcher from New York explained:<ref>Euchner, ''Nobody Turn Me Around'' (2010), pp. 24\u201325.</ref>\n\n<blockquote>It's like [[St Patrick's Day]]. I came out of respect for what my people are doing, not because I believe it will do any good. I thought it would do some good in the beginning. But when the march started to get all the official approval from ''Mastah'' Kennedy, ''Mastah'' Wagner, ''Mastah'' Spellman, and they started setting limits on how we had to march peacefully, I knew that the march was going to be a mockery, that ''they'' were giving ''us'' something again.</blockquote>\n\nMarcher Beverly Alston thought that the day had its greatest impact within the movement: \"Culturally, there has been tremendous progress over the past forty years. Black awareness and self-determination has soared. Politically, I just don't think we've made enough progress.\"<ref>Bass, ''Like a Mighty Stream'' (2002), p. 72.</ref> Fifteen-year-old Ericka Jenkins from Washington said:<ref>Euchner, ''Nobody Turn Me Around'' (2010), pp. 81\u201382.</ref>\n\n<blockquote>I saw people laughing and listening and standing very close to one another, almost in an embrace. Children of every size, pregnant women, elderly people who seemed tired but happy to be there, clothing that made me know that they struggled to make it day to day, made me know they worked in farms or offices or even nearby for the government. I didn't see teenagers alone; I saw groups of teenagers with teachers. <br />\nWhite people [were] standing in wonder. Their eyes were open, they were ''listening''. Openness and nothing on guard\u2014I saw that in everybody. I was so happy to see that in the white people that they could listen and take in and respect and believe in the words of a black person. I had never seen anything like that.</blockquote>\n\nSome people discussed racism becoming less explicit after the March. Reverend Abraham Woods of Birmingham commented: \"Everything has changed. And when you look at it, nothing has changed. Racism is under the surface, and an incident that could scratch it, can bring it out.\"<ref>Bass, ''Like a Mighty Stream'' (2002), p. 101.</ref>\n\n== Effects and legacy ==\nThe symbolism of the March has been contested since before it even took place. In the years following the March, movement radicals increasingly subscribed to Malcolm X's narrative of the March as a co-optation by the white establishment. Liberals and conservatives tended to embrace the March, but focused mostly on King's \"I Have a Dream\" speech and the legislative successes of 1964 and 1965.<ref name=JonesDissent>William P. Jones, \"[http://www.dissentmagazine.org/article/the-forgotten-radical-history-of-the-march-on-washington The Forgotten Radical History of the March on Washington]\"; ''Dissent'', Spring 2013.</ref>\n\nThe mass media identified King's speech as a highlight of the event and focused on this oration to the exclusion of other aspects. For several decades, King took center stage in narratives about the March. More recently, historians and commentators have acknowledged the role played by Bayard Rustin in organizing the event.<ref name=Wickham>DeWayne Wickham, \"[https://archive.is/20130817164951/http://www.guampdn.com/article/20130815/OPINION02/308150017/Rustin-finally-getting-due-recognition Rustin finally getting due recognition]\"; ''Pacific Daily News'', 15 August 2013.</ref>\n\n=== Political effects ===\nSoon after the speakers ended their meetings with Congress to go join the March, both houses passed legislation to create a dispute arbitration board for striking railroad workers.<ref>Euchner, ''Nobody Turn Me Around'' (2010), p. 89</ref>\n\nThe March is credited with propelling the U.S. government into action on civil rights, creating political momentum for the [[Civil Rights Act of 1964]] and the [[Voting Rights Act]] of 1965.<ref name=Bartlett>Bruce Bartlett, \"[http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Columns/2013/08/09/The-1963-March-on-Washington-Changed-Politics-Forever.aspx#page1 The 1963 March on Washington Changed Politics Forever]\"; ''The Fiscal Times'', 9 August 2013.</ref>\n\nThe cooperation of a Democratic administration with the issue of civil rights marked a pivotal moment in voter alignment within the U.S. The [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]] gave up the [[Solid South]]\u2014its undivided support since Reconstruction among the segregated Southern states\u2014and went on to capture a high proportion of votes from blacks from the Republicans.<ref name=Bartlett /><ref>Bruce Bartlett, \"[http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Columns/2013/08/16/How-the-March-on-Washington-Flipped-the-Southern-Vote.aspx#page1 How the March on Washington Flipped the Southern Vote]\"; ''Fiscal Times'', 16 August 1963.</ref>\n\n=== Anniversary marches ===\n[[File:Walking in to the march 2 - 50th Anniversary of the Civil Rights March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom.jpg|thumb|right|175px|50th Anniversary of the Civil Rights March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom]]\n\nThe 1963 March also spurred anniversary marches that occur every five years, with the 20th and 25th being some of the most well known.

They contend that many of the March's primary goals\u2014including housing, integrated education, and widespread employment at living wages\u2014have not been accomplished. They further argued that although legal advances were made, black people still live in concentrated areas of poverty (\"ghettoes\"), where they receive inferior education and suffer from widespread unemployment.<ref>Algernon Austin, \"[http://www.epi.org/publication/unfinished-march-overview/ The Unfinished March: An Overview]\"; [[Economic Policy Institute]] Report, 18 June 2013.</ref>\n\nDedrick Muhammad of the NAACP writes that racial inequality of income and homeownership have increased since 1963 and worsened during the recent [[Great Recession]].<ref>Dedrick Muhammad, \"[http://www.huffingtonpost.com/dedrick-muhammad/50-years-after-the-march-_1_b_3749897.html 50 Years After the March On Washington: The Economic Impacts on Education]\"; ''Huffington Post'', 13 August 2013.</ref>\n{{clear}}\n\n==Gallery==\n<div align=center>\n<gallery widths=\"140\" heights=\"180\">\nFile:Poitier Belafonte Heston Civil Rights March 1963.jpg|[[Sidney Poitier]], [[Harry Belafonte]] and [[Charlton Heston]]\nFile:Civil Rights March on Washington, D.C.

For the first 16 years, Gwinnett Place was the leading mall in the region, drawing shoppers from as far away as [[South Carolina]] and centering what was then one of the fastest-growing counties in the nation until the openings of [[Mall of Georgia]] in [[Buford, Georgia|Buford]] and [[Sugarloaf Mills]] in [[Lawrenceville, Georgia|Lawrenceville]]. It was  also used as the  StarCourt Mall filming location in the [[Stranger Things (season 3)|third season]] of [[Netflix]]'s ''[[Stranger Things]]''.\n\n==History==\n{{unsourced section|date=July 2019}}\nWhen it first opened in early 1984, its original anchors were [[Rich's (department store)|Rich's]], [[Davison's]] and [[Sears]]. In 1986, [[Mervyn's]] joined the mall and Davison's was changed over to [[Macy's]]. Further anchor shuffling occurred in 1995 when [[Parisian (department store)|Parisian]] joined the mall and Mervyn's left the mall in 1997, respectively. [[J. C. Penney]] took over the Mervyn's spot the following year and closed in 2015, with Beauty Master taking over in 2016. Macy's and Rich's merged in 2003 to form Rich's-Macy's until 2005 when the name was changed to just Macy's. With two Macy's in the mall, the former Davison's closed and in 2010 reopened as the first MegaMart in the U.S. In 2007, Parisian was renamed [[Belk]], which closed in 2013 and remains vacant to this day. In these aspects, the mall developed on a very similar fashion as [[Town Center at Cobb]] on the northwest side of Atlanta, and were in many ways sister malls. However, one of the distinct features about Gwinnett Place Mall is the Macy's (former Rich's), which features an exterior almost entirely covered in mirrored glass.\n\n==Today==\nThe mall was seriously challenged and hurt by the openings of [[The Mall at Robinson]] in 1999 and [[Discover Mills|Sugarloaf Mills]] in 2001 (also owned by Simon). Not only did the mall take a large part of its customer base and all of its out-of-state shoppers to these new malls, but the mall was also unable to attract any new anchors for several years although the [[Macy's]] moved its location to the defunct [[Rich's (department store)|Rich's]] on the west side of the mall and Parisian became Belk. In 2008, Gwinnett Technical College opened an International Education Center there, where students enrolled at Gwinnett Technical College go to take foreign language classes, and other classes, such as general Korean store Mega Mart opened a location in the former Macy's. Currently, a number of the mall's store fronts and spots in the food court are empty and for lease. The recent downturn of the mall in 2013 has led to the closure of Belk as well as owner and manager [[Simon Property Group]] to lose the mall to foreclosure where it was acquired by retail rehab specialist, Moonbeam Capital Investments LLC. JCPenney closed April 4, 2015 and Beauty Master, the regional beauty department store purchased the former JCPenney building in March 2016. The former Belk is expected to have some redevelopment but may close by 2020.{{Citation needed|date=July 2019}}\n\nIn December 2017 the body of a 19-year-old woman was found in the back room of the food court, where it had gone unnoticed for weeks. The mall has also had ongoing issues with homelessness, gangs, and prostitution in and around the mall and surrounding areas. In January 2018, two mall employees were robbed and assaulted in the Macy's parking lot; in March 2018, a 32-year-old female was arrested for indecent exposure, solicitation of prostitution, and possession of heroin and cocaine in the Sears parking lot.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.myajc.com/business/kempner-body-unnoticed-atlanta-mall-for-weeks-mall-long-fall/8DQJ5GxnReE79QyQMt1DRJ/|title=Kempner: Body unnoticed in Atlanta area mall for weeks?

The district magistrate or the deputy commissioner is assisted by a number of officials belonging to different wings of the administrative services of the state.\n\nA superintendent of Police, an officer belonging to [[Indian Police Service]] is entrusted with the responsibility of maintaining law and order and related issues.\n\n==Administrative history==\nBefore Indian independence, present-day Chhattisgarh state was divided between the [[Central Provinces and Berar]], a province of British India, and a number of [[princely states]] in the north, south, and east, which were part of the [[Eastern States Agency]].\n\nThe British province encompassed the central portion of the state, and was made up of three districts, [[Raipur District|Raipur]], [[Bilaspur District, Chhattisgarh|Bilaspur]], and [[Durg District|Durg]], which made up the [[Chhattisgarh Division]] of the Central Provinces. Durg District was created in 1906 out of the eastern portion of Raipur District.\n\nThe northern portion of the state, comprising present-day Koriya, Surajpur, Surguja, Jashpur, and Raigarh districts, was divided among the six princely states of Chang Bhakar, Jashpur, Koriya, Surajpur, Raigarh, Surguja, and Udaipur. To the east the states of [[Rajnandgaon|Nandgaon]], [[Khairagarh]], and [[Kawardha]] comprised parts of present-day Rajnandgaon and Kawardha districts. In the south, the state of Kanker comprised the northern portion of present-day Kanker District, and the state of [[Bastar state|Bastar]] included present-day Bastar and Dantewada districts and the southern part of Kanker District.\n\nAfter Indian Independence, the princely states were merged with the Central Provinces and Berar to form the new state of [[Madhya Pradesh]]. Present-day Chhattisgarh comprised seven districts of Madhya Pradesh. The former states of Kanker and Bastar formed the new Bastar District, the parts of Surguja, Korea, and Chang Bhakar formed the new Surguja District, and the states of Nandgaon, Khairagarh, and Kawardha formed the new Rajnandgaon District.\n\nIn 1998, the seven districts that make up present-day Chhattisgarh were reorganized to form 16 districts. Dantewada and Kanker districts were split from Bastar; Dhamtari District was split from Raipur; Janjgir-Champa and Korba districts were split from Bilaspur; Jashpur District was split from Raigarh; Kawardha District was formed from parts of Bilaspur and Rajnandgaon; Koriya and Surajpur District was split from Surguja; and Mahasamund District was split from Raipur.\n\nOn 1 November 2000, these 16 districts were split from [[Madhya Pradesh]] to form the new state of Chhattisgarh.<ref>[http://www.chhattisgarh.nic.in/profile/corigin.htm#creation Creation of Chhattisgarh] ''Government of Chhattisgarh.</ref> Two new districts were added afterwards.

The district magistrate or the deputy commissioner is assisted by a number of officials belonging to different wings of the administrative services of the state.\n\nA superintendent of Police, an officer belonging to [[Indian Police Service]] is entrusted with the responsibility of maintaining law and order and related issues.\n\n==Administrative history==\nBefore Indian independence, present-day Chhattisgarh state was divided between the [[Central Provinces and Berar]], a province of British India, and a number of [[princely states]] in the north, south, and east, which were part of the [[Eastern States Agency]].\n\nThe British province encompassed the central portion of the state, and was made up of three districts, [[Raipur District|Raipur]], [[Bilaspur District, Chhattisgarh|Bilaspur]], and [[Durg District|Durg]], which made up the [[Chhattisgarh Division]] of the Central Provinces. Durg District was created in 1906 out of the eastern portion of Raipur District.\n\nThe northern portion of the state, comprising present-day Koriya, Surajpur, Surguja, Jashpur, and Raigarh districts, was divided among the six princely states of Chang Bhakar, Jashpur, Koriya, Surajpur, Raigarh, Surguja, and Udaipur. To the east the states of [[Rajnandgaon|Nandgaon]], [[Khairagarh]], and [[Kawardha]] comprised parts of present-day Rajnandgaon and Kawardha districts. In the south, the state of Kanker comprised the northern portion of present-day Kanker District, and the state of [[Bastar state|Bastar]] included present-day Bastar and Dantewada districts and the southern part of Kanker District.\n\nAfter Indian Independence, the princely states were merged with the Central Provinces and Berar to form the new state of [[Madhya Pradesh]]. Present-day Chhattisgarh comprised seven districts of Madhya Pradesh. The former states of Kanker and Bastar formed the new Bastar District, the parts of Surguja, Korea, and Chang Bhakar formed the new Surguja District, and the states of Nandgaon, Khairagarh, and Kawardha formed the new Rajnandgaon District.\n\nIn 1998, the seven districts that make up present-day Chhattisgarh were reorganized to form 16 districts. Dantewada and Kanker districts were split from Bastar; Dhamtari District was split from Raipur; Janjgir-Champa and Korba districts were split from Bilaspur; Jashpur District was split from Raigarh; Kawardha District was formed from parts of Bilaspur and Rajnandgaon; Koriya and Surajpur District was split from Surguja; and Mahasamund District was split from Raipur.\n\nOn 1 November 2000, these 16 districts were split from [[Madhya Pradesh]] to form the new state of Chhattisgarh.<ref>[http://www.chhattisgarh.nic.in/profile/corigin.htm#creation Creation of Chhattisgarh] ''Government of Chhattisgarh.</ref> Two new districts were added afterwards.
