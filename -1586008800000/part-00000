Pistone]] (Depp), an [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] undercover agent who infiltrated the [[Bonanno crime family]] in [[New York City]] during the 1970s, under the alias Donnie Brasco. Brasco maneuvers his way into the confidence of an aging Mafia [[hitman]], [[Benjamin Ruggiero|Lefty Ruggiero]] (Pacino), who vouches for him.

The film was a box office success, earning $124 million against its $35 million budget, and received positive reviews from critics.

Lefty teaches Donnie the rules of the [[Italian-American Mafia|Mafia]] and introduces him to several [[made men]], including [[Dominick Napolitano|Sonny]], Nicky, and [[caporegime]] [[Alphonse Indelicato|Sonny Red]].\n\nDonnie Brasco is revealed to be Joseph D. Pistone, an [[undercover]] FBI agent, whose wife, Maggie, is not fond of the his undercover position.  After the Bonanno family's street boss is killed, Sonny Red assumes the his position, and is later promoted to captain, instead of Lefty, who provided for Sonny's crew while he was imprisoned.  As the crew runs a series of successful shakedowns and hijackings in Brooklyn, Donnie/Pistone infiltrates the Mafia and collects more information for the FBI via [[wiretap]] recording.  \n\nFBI supervisor from Washington, Dean Blanford, takes an interest in the case, and asks Pistone to incorporate a Miami-based FBI agent, Richie Gazzo, into the Bonanno's operation. Though reluctant, Pistone convinces Sonny and the crew to meet Gazzo in Miami, where Donnie and Lefty plan to run Richie's Trafficante nightclub on their own, and attempt to impress Florida mob boss with a yacht party.  Sonny reaches there first, angering Lefty, especially for offering Donnie to run the club as an unofficial made man.  However later they reconcile when Lefty's son nearly dies of a drug overdose.\n\nOn the opening day of the Trafficante, Sonny's club is raided by Miami police on orders from ////////// , who was colluding with Sonny Red. Suspecting Sonny Red to be responsible, the crew, without Donnie, kill Sonny Red and two rival capo-regimes after calling a meeting. The crew also kills Nicky, who was found to have been carrying out a narcotics deal without Sonny's knowledge and without making payments \"up the chain.\" Donnie helps with the clean up of the bodies. With Sonny becoming the new street boss, Donnie is tasked with finding and killing Sonny Red's son, Bruno.\n\nAt home, Pistone's behavior increasingly becomes like that of the criminal he pretends to be. One last dispute between Donnie and his wife becomes physical.\n\nWith increasing pressure from the FBI to end the operation and make arrests, Donnie tries convincing Lefty to escape his criminal life. However, Bruno is tracked down and Lefty discovers that the yacht Donnie had previously arranged was federally owned. Outside the location where Bruno is hiding, Lefty confronts Donnie about his loyalties. At gunpoint, Lefty forces Donnie out to kill Bruno to confirm his loyalties, but before either murder can be committed, FBI agents arrive and apprehend them.\n\nFBI agents visit Sonny's hangout, and reveal Donnie's true identity to him and his crew by showing them photographs of Pistone in FBI uniform. Later, Lefty is summoned to a meeting; he leaves behind his valuables and tells his girlfriend that if Donnie calls to tell him that \"if it was going to be anyone, I'm glad it was him,\" as he goes to his implied death. With his family in attendance, Pistone attends a small private ceremony for his service, being awarded a $500 check and a medal.\n\nThe end title cards state that the evidence collected by \"Donnie Brasco\" led to over 200 indictments and over 100 convictions. Pistone lives with his wife under an assumed name in an undisclosed location, with a $500,000 open contract on his head.\n\n== Cast ==\n<!--ACCORDING TO THE END CREDITS OF THE FILM per WP:FILMCAST-->\n{{cast list|\n* [[Al Pacino]] as [[Lefty Ruggiero|Lefty]]\n* [[Johnny Depp]] as [[Donnie Brasco|Donnie]]\n* [[Michael Madsen]] as [[Dominick Napolitano|Sonny]]\n* [[Bruno Kirby]] as Nicky\n* [[James Russo]] as Paulie\n* [[Anne Heche]]  as Maggie\n* [[\u017deljko Ivanek]] as Tim Curley\n* [[Gerry Becker]] as Dean Blandford FBI\n* [[Robert Miano]] as [[Al Indelicato|Sonny Red]]\n* [[Brian Tarantina]] as Bruno\n* [[Rocco Sisto]] as Richie Gazzo\n* [[Zach Grenier]] as Dr. Berger\n* [[Walt MacPherson]] as Sheriff\n* Ronnie Farer as Annette\n* [[Terry Serpico]] as Strip club owner\n* [[Gretchen Mol]] as Sonny's girlfriend\n* [[Tony Lip]] as Philly Lucky\n* George Angelica as Big Trin\n* [[Val Avery]] as Trafficante\n* Madison Arnold as Jilly\n}}\n\n== Production ==\nLouis DiGiaimo, who worked as a casting director for Barry Levinson, was a childhood acquaintance of Joseph D. Pistone, and served as a consultant for his book ''Donnie Brasco: My Undercover Life in the Mafia''. Once the book came out, Levinson's company, Baltimore Pictures, purchased the rights, with screenwriter Paul Attanasio set to write the script. [[Stephen Frears]] would direct and [[Tom Cruise]] would play Pistone/Brasco. In 1991, the film was postponed due to the release of ''[[Goodfellas]]'', as the producers felt there was not enough room for two hyperrealistic Mafia films.

[[Michael Madsen]], [[Bruno Kirby]], [[James Russo]], and [[Anne Heche]] appeared in supporting roles.\n\nThe film is loosely based on the true story of [[Joseph D. Pistone]] (Depp), an [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] undercover agent who infiltrated the [[Bonanno crime family]] in [[New York City]] during the 1970s, under the alias Donnie Brasco. Brasco maneuvers his way into the confidence of an aging Mafia [[hitman]], [[Benjamin Ruggiero|Lefty Ruggiero]] (Pacino), who vouches for him. As Donnie moves deeper into the Mafia, he realizes that not only is he crossing the line between federal agent and criminal, but also leading his friend Lefty to an almost certain death.\n\n''Donnie Brasco'' was released on February 28, 1997 by [[TriStar Pictures]]. The film was a box office success, earning $124 million against its $35 million budget, and received positive reviews from critics. The film was nominated for an [[Academy Awards|Oscar]] for [[Academy Award for Best Adapted Screenplay|Best Adapted Screenplay]]. The adaptation of [[Donnie Brasco: My Undercover Life in the Mafia|the book]] by Joseph D. Pistone and Richard Woodley was by screenwriter [[Paul Attanasio]].<ref name=\"oscar\">{{cite web\n | url = http://www.oscars.org/awards/academyawards/oscarlegacy/1990-1999/70nominees.html\n | title = Nominees & Winners for the 70th Academy Awards &#124; Academy of Motion Picture Arts & Sciences\n | website = Oscars.org\n | access-date = May 6, 2012\n}}</ref>\n\n== Plot ==\n<!-- Per WP:FILMPLOT, the plot summary should be 400-700 words. -->\nIn 1970s New York City, an aging gangster in the [[Bonanno crime family]], [[Lefty Ruggiero|Lefty]], is introduced to a jewel thief named [[Donnie Brasco|Donnie]]. Donnie impresses Lefty by threatening a diamond dealer whom Donnie suspects of selling Lefty a fake ring. Lefty teaches Donnie the rules of the [[Italian-American Mafia|Mafia]] and introduces him to several [[made men]], including [[Dominick Napolitano|Sonny]], Nicky, and [[caporegime]] [[Alphonse Indelicato|Sonny Red]].\n\nDonnie Brasco is revealed to be Joseph D. Pistone, an [[undercover]] FBI agent. His wife, Maggie, is not fond of the circumstances surrounding his undercover operation.\n\nAfter the Bonanno family's street boss is killed, Sonny Red assumes the new position. Sonny is promoted to captain, angering Lefty, as he provided for Sonny's crew while he was in prison. As the crew runs a series of successful shakedowns and hijackings in Brooklyn, Donnie collects more information for the FBI via [[wiretap]].\n\nDue to Pistone's success at infiltrating the Mafia, an FBI supervisor from Washington, Dean Blanford, takes an interest in the case. He asks Pistone to incorporate a Miami-based FBI agent, Richie Gazzo, into the Bonanno's operation. Though reluctant, Pistone convinces Sonny and the crew to meet Gazzo in Miami.\n\nIn Miami, Donnie and Lefty plan to run Richie's nightclub on their own, and attempt to impress Florida mob boss, Trafficante, with a yacht party. However, Sonny reaches out to Trafficante first, angering Lefty, especially when Sonny Black tells Donnie to work for him and run the club as an unofficial made man. Donnie reconciles with Lefty when Lefty's son nearly dies of a drug overdose.\n\nOn its opening day, Sonny's club is raided by Miami police on orders from Trafficante, who was colluding with Sonny Red. Suspecting Sonny Red to be responsible, the crew, without Donnie, kill Sonny Red and two rival caporegimes after calling a meeting. The crew also kills Nicky, who was found to have been carrying out a narcotics deal without Sonny's knowledge and without making payments \"up the chain.\" Donnie helps with the clean up of the bodies. With Sonny becoming the new street boss, Donnie is tasked with finding and killing Sonny Red's son, Bruno.\n\nAt home, Pistone's behavior increasingly becomes like that of the criminal he pretends to be. One last dispute between Donnie and his wife becomes physical.\n\nWith increasing pressure from the FBI to end the operation and make arrests, Donnie tries convincing Lefty to escape his criminal life. However, Bruno is tracked down and Lefty discovers that the yacht Donnie had previously arranged was federally owned. Outside the location where Bruno is hiding, Lefty confronts Donnie about his loyalties. At gunpoint, Lefty forces Donnie out to kill Bruno to confirm his loyalties, but before either murder can be committed, FBI agents arrive and apprehend them.\n\nFBI agents visit Sonny's hangout, and reveal Donnie's true identity to him and his crew by showing them photographs of Pistone in FBI uniform. Later, Lefty is summoned to a meeting; he leaves behind his valuables and tells his girlfriend that if Donnie calls to tell him that \"if it was going to be anyone, I'm glad it was him,\" as he goes to his implied death. With his family in attendance, Pistone attends a small private ceremony for his service, being awarded a $500 check and a medal.\n\nThe end title cards state that the evidence collected by \"Donnie Brasco\" led to over 200 indictments and over 100 convictions. Pistone lives with his wife under an assumed name in an undisclosed location, with a $500,000 open contract on his head.\n\n== Cast ==\n<!--ACCORDING TO THE END CREDITS OF THE FILM per WP:FILMCAST-->\n{{cast list|\n* [[Al Pacino]] as [[Lefty Ruggiero|Lefty]]\n* [[Johnny Depp]] as [[Donnie Brasco|Donnie]]\n* [[Michael Madsen]] as [[Dominick Napolitano|Sonny]]\n* [[Bruno Kirby]] as Nicky\n* [[James Russo]] as Paulie\n* [[Anne Heche]]  as Maggie\n* [[\u017deljko Ivanek]] as Tim Curley\n* [[Gerry Becker]] as Dean Blandford FBI\n* [[Robert Miano]] as [[Al Indelicato|Sonny Red]]\n* [[Brian Tarantina]] as Bruno\n* [[Rocco Sisto]] as Richie Gazzo\n* [[Zach Grenier]] as Dr. Berger\n* [[Walt MacPherson]] as Sheriff\n* Ronnie Farer as Annette\n* [[Terry Serpico]] as Strip club owner\n* [[Gretchen Mol]] as Sonny's girlfriend\n* [[Tony Lip]] as Philly Lucky\n* George Angelica as Big Trin\n* [[Val Avery]] as Trafficante\n* Madison Arnold as Jilly\n}}\n\n== Production ==\nLouis DiGiaimo, who worked as a casting director for Barry Levinson, was a childhood acquaintance of Joseph D. Pistone, and served as a consultant for his book ''Donnie Brasco: My Undercover Life in the Mafia''. Once the book came out, Levinson's company, Baltimore Pictures, purchased the rights, with screenwriter Paul Attanasio set to write the script. [[Stephen Frears]] would direct and [[Tom Cruise]] would play Pistone/Brasco. In 1991, the film was postponed due to the release of ''[[Goodfellas]]'', as the producers felt there was not enough room for two hyperrealistic Mafia films. When the project was resurrected in 1996, Frears was replaced with Mike Newell, and Johnny Depp was cast as Pistone/Brasco. Al Pacino was the only actor kept from the first attempt to make the film. Pistone was hired as a consultant, helping Depp and Pacino develop their characters.<ref name=\"dvd\">\"Donnie Brasco: Out from the Shadows\", featurette appearing on ''Donnie Brasco'' DVD\n</ref>{{additional citation needed|date=March 2017}}\n\n== Reception ==\nReview aggregator [[Rotten Tomatoes]] reports that 88% of critics have given the film a positive review based on 57 reviews, with an average score of 7.81/10.

Adam enters the apartment building, then is attacked and knocked unconscious by Ingrid.  He wakes in The Stranger's apartment, chained to an anchored table. She tells of finding out later that her father had killed her mother.  She also discloses that she learned that Killane (unbeknownst to him) is not actually her biological father, and that she is in fact Adam's half-sister through an affair Ed had with her mother.

Christine is hospitalized; Ingrid dies of her wounds. Christine admits to Adam that Bob, the football coach, had hired her to dig dirt on Corinne.

Johanna asks Wes to hide the fact that she knew Heidi so that she can be assigned to the investigation.  Adam confronts Mike's dad, Doug, after learning that the secretive phone call that Corinne made on the day of her disappearance was to him.  Doug tells Adam that the phone call concerned the money stolen from the football club and that Corinne wanted more time to sort the situation out and to show her innocence. At the murder investigation, Katz attempts to throw suspicion on Heidi's husband or a burglar, and volunteers to check the security videotape.  Thomas and Ryan tell Adam that they have tracked Corinne's phone and the three of them, with Killane, drive toward it, but they eventually find the phone abandoned on a bridge.

Thomas and Mike go to see Daisy, and Mike confronts her over her belief that he had proliferated the nude photos of Ella. She believes his protestations of innocence, and admits to having drugged him with PCP during the rave, confessing that Olivia was the person who had accused Mike to her. They go to see Olivia, but her mother lies, saying that Olivia is still in the hospital. The Stranger and her friend wonder why they had not heard from Heidi and learn online that she had been murdered, thereupon deciding to immediately shut down their operation.

Adam tells Johanna of Killane's confession. Johanna tells him that Corinne's car was located, and together they go to it and discover one of Corinne's earrings in the rear seat.  Thomas, Mike, and Daisy decide to try again to confront Olivia; she admits to Thomas that it was she, not Mike, who sent the photos from Ella's phone out of jealousy for Mike's attention. Adam tells Johanna about Ingrid. Wes finds Ingrid's office cleaned out.

Dante, recovering in hospital, is interviewed by Johanna; he tells her that Daisy absconded with his clothes after an invitation to skinny-dip. He said he then was discovered by Max Bonner (Robert Ewens), the sports-club caretaker, who chased him with an axe, but that he remembers nothing more. Johanna and Wes interview Max, who claims he was only harvesting firewood and did no harm to Dante, who simply tripped and fell. Ed brings Peter Ince, a private investigator, to Adam to assist in the search for Corinne. Adam tells Ed and Peter about Corinne's fake pregnancy, his own affair, and The Stranger, prompting Ed to relate that The Stranger had visited him as well. Since The Stranger had been in the hospital while Killane was there, Ed surmises that the two are connected and Ed, Peter, and Adam begin to go through Killane's possessions, which Ed's company holds in storage. Johanna eulogizes Heidi at her memorial, while Wes reviews the case evidence. Johanna goes to Katz' house, and he tells her about his daughter's poisoning.

Peter tracks The Stranger (Christine Killane's) home address. Adam phones Johanna, reaching Katz, saying that The Stranger has been identified, and promising to text the location to Johanna's phone later, which he does on arrival at Christine's home address. Adam enters the apartment building, then is attacked and knocked unconscious by Ingrid.  He wakes in The Stranger's apartment, chained to an anchored table. She tells of finding out later that her father had killed her mother.  She also discloses that she learned that Killane (unbenownst to him) is not actually her biological father, and that she is in fact Adam's half-sister through an affair Ed had with her mother.  Katz bursts in brandishing a gun and holding Ingrid hostage; he tosses Ingrid to the ground then shoots her in the stomach. Adam escapes from his chains and attacks Katz, but is overpowered.  When Katz shoots at Adam, Christine jumps in front to take the bullet in her back. Police enter to take control of the situation. Johanna arrests Katz for Heidi's murder. Christine is hospitalized; Ingrid dies of her wounds. Christine admits to Adam that Bob, the football coach, had hired her to dig dirt on Corinne. Adam confronts Bob, and Bob tells Adam that Doug claimed Corinne stole the money from the football club and that she intended to pin the theft on Bob.  Adam drives to Doug's house and confronts him about stealing the money and sending texts from Corinne's phone after her disappearance, pulling a gun that Christine passed to him in the hospital. In fear, Doug offers to take Adam to Corinne, who is in the countryside. Johanna visits the school to have Thomas use the phone tracker to locate Adam.  On reaching the site, Doug admits to killing and burying Corinne, and Adam locates her body in a shallow grave.  Adam shoots and kills Doug as Johanna arrives.

For example, records of the Fitzwilliam family of Mablethorpe Hall date back to the 14th century. In the 19th century, it was a centre for [[ship breaking]] during the winter. Mablethorpe Hall is to the west of the town along ''Alford Road'', near the parish [https://www.geograph.org.uk/photo/771806 church] of St Mary.<ref>[https://www.geograph.org.uk/photo/771806 church.]</ref> (The Mablethorpe church group also covers Trusthorpe.)\n\n===Town lifeboats===\nIn 1883 the first lifeboat station was built in Mablethorpe and ran until the [[First World War]], when it closed temporarily due to crew shortages. These continued, and the station closed permanently after the war. It reopened as an inshore lifeboat station in 1965. A further new lifeboat station ensued in 1996.<ref>[https://www.geograph.org.uk/photo/231899.]</ref> A D class lifeboat, D-506 ''Patrick Rex Moren'', went into service on 9 July 1996, followed in 2001 by a B class Atlantic 75 lifeboat, B\u2013778 ''Joan Mary'', and in 2005 by a D class lifeboat, D\u2013653 ''William Hadley''.\n\nIn 1998, a bronze medal was awarded to the helmsman for service on 12 April, when the lifeboat rescued a crew of two and saved the fishing vessel ''Lark'', which had broken down in the surf and was drifting towards the shore without her anchor. The lifeboat was launched in a force 7 gale and a heavy swell \u2013 extreme conditions for this class. The helmsman had difficulty in negotiating the rough seas to reach the fishing boat, decided it was too hazardous to take off the crew and passed a line and towed her from danger \u2013 a considerable feat in huge seas for a lifeboat smaller than the fishing boat and powered by one 40 hp outboard engine.\n\n===East Coast floods===\nIn 1953, Mablethorpe was hit by the disastrous [[North Sea flood of 1953|East Coast floods]]. The seawall was breached on 31 January. A granite rock memorial was unveiled on the coast on 31 January 2013 in memory of the town's 42 victims.<ref>[https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-lincolnshire-20995461 BBC News.

Some features of the town have been named after him (for example, Tennyson Road and Tennyson High School).\n\n===D. H. Lawrence===\nMablethorpe is the destination for the fictional Morel family's first holiday in the [[D. H. Lawrence]] novel, ''[[Sons and Lovers]]'', published in 1913. \"At last they got an answer from Mablethorpe, a cottage such as they wished for thirty shillings a week. There was immense jubilation. Paul was wild with joy for his mother's sake. She would have a real holiday now. He and she sat at evening picturing what it would be like. Annie came in, and Leonard, and Alice, and Kitty. There was wild rejoicing and anticipation. Paul told Miriam. She seemed to brood with joy over it. But the Morel's house rang with excitement.\"\n\n===Transport===\nMablethorpe and much of east Lincolnshire lost its [[Mablethorpe railway station|rail service]] in 1970 to the [[Beeching Axe]]. The station site is now the town's sports centre.\n\n[[Stagecoach in Lincolnshire|Stagecoach]] Interconnect 9 runs through the town, halfway between [[Skegness]] and [[Louth, Lincolnshire|Louth]] about once a hour.

High street chains such as [[Boots UK|Boots]], [[Shoe Zone]], [[Heron Foods|Heron]], [[Greggs]] and [[Cooplands]] are present, but most shops are independent.\n\n===Leisure===\nFamily attractions include a small [[Funfair|fairground]] and an award-winning beach with traditional seaside [[amusement arcades]]s. One of Mablethorpe's long-standing features, its sand train, takes visitors to and from the northerly point of the beach.<ref>[https://www.geograph.org.uk/photo/272023.]</ref><ref>[https://www.geograph.org.uk/photo/211670.]</ref> [[Mablethorpe Seal Sanctuary and Wildlife Centre]] is also north of the town.\n\nMablethorpe's cinema, the ''Loewen'' in Quebec Road, was previously known as the ''Bijou''. ''The Dunes'' leisure complex lies on Mablethorpe's seafront. In 2008, the old ''Dunes Theatre'' became ''Sharky's Bar'' after a refit, but returned to its original function and name in 2012.\n\nA [[skatepark]] was opened in May 2008 on the seafront. This includes a small [[funbox]], a spine and two [[quarter pipes]].\n\nSeveral small [[caravan park]]s and guest houses provide tourist accommodation.\n{{clear left}}\n\n==Electric power==\nJust over a mile north-east of the town, near the Seal Sanctuary, lies [[Theddlethorpe Gas Terminal]], which supplies 5 per cent of the UK's gas. To the west is the Bambers wind farm, which opened in November 2004 and houses eight [[turbines]] \u2013 producing five [[Megawatts|MW]] of power. The Bambers II [[wind farm]], an extension of the first, opened in November 2006, and produces an additional 5 MW of power.<ref>[https://www.geograph.org.uk/photo/1003427.]</ref> The two turbines at Mablethorpe wind farm, which produce 1.2 MW of power, were the first such turbines in Lincolnshire when built in July 2002.

The original parish of Mablethorpe covers a rectangular area inland along Alford Road towards [[Maltby le Marsh]], as far as Grange Leisure Park, where Earl's Bridge crosses West Bank.<ref>[https://www.geograph.org.uk/photo/520401 A1104.]</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.grangeleisurepark.co.uk |title=Grange Leisure Park |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071223191100/http://www.grangeleisurepark.co.uk/ |archivedate=23 December 2007}}</ref><ref>[https://www.geograph.org.uk/photo/520429.]</ref><ref>[https://www.geograph.org.uk/photo/520807.]</ref> The south of the former parish follows the Trusthorpe Drains which are crossed at Bamber's Bridge on ''Mile Lane''.<ref>[https://www.geograph.org.uk/photo/216902.]</ref>Out towards [[Alford, Lincolnshire|Alford]] lies [[RAF Strubby|''Strubby Airfield'']], with the Strubby Aviation Club and Lincs Gliding Club. To the north is the large parish of [[Theddlethorpe|Theddlethorpe St Helen]], which extends to the River Great Eau  at [[Saltfleetby]]. The town is the eastern terminus of the [[A52 road|A52]]. The town is also accessed via the A1104 and [[A16 road (England)|A16]] through Alford. The A157 to and from [[Louth, Lincolnshire|Louth]] is said to be the sixth bendiest in the UK.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/dorset/4683276.stm |title=BBC NEWS \u2013 UK \u2013 England \u2013 Dorset \u2013 Bendiest roads in the UK revealed |publisher=}}</ref>.\n\n==Commerce==\nThe town's one retail bank branch, [[Barclays]], closed in July 2019.<ref>[https://www.e-lindsey.gov.uk/article/10881/Closure-of-Barclays-branch-in-Mablethorpe East Lindsey District Council site.

High street chains such as [[Boots UK|Boots]], [[Shoe Zone]], [[Heron Foods|Heron]], [[Greggs]] and [[Cooplands]] are present, but most shops are independent.\n\n===Leisure===\nFamily attractions include a small [[Funfair|fairground]] and an award-winning beach with traditional seaside [[amusement arcades]]s. One of Mablethorpe's long-standing features, its sand train takes visitors to and from the northerly point of the beach.<ref>[https://www.geograph.org.uk/photo/272023.]</ref><ref>[https://www.geograph.org.uk/photo/211670.]</ref> [[Mablethorpe Seal Sanctuary and Wildlife Centre]] is also north of the town.\n\nMablethorpe's cinema, the ''Loewen'' in Quebec Road, was previously known as the ''Bijou''. ''The Dunes'' leisure complex lies on Mablethorpe's seafront. In 2008, the old ''Dunes Theatre'' became ''Sharky's Bar'' after a refit, but returned to its original state and name in 2012.\n\nA [[skatepark]] was opened in May 2008 on the seafront. This includes a small [[funbox]], a spine and two [[quarter pipes]].\n\nSeveral small [[caravan park]]s and guest houses provide tourist accommodation.\n{{clear left}}\n\n==Electric power==\nJust over a mile north-east of the town, near the Seal Sanctuary, lies [[Theddlethorpe Gas Terminal]], which supplies 5 per cent of the UK's gas. To the west is the Bambers wind farm, which opened in November 2004 and houses eight [[turbines]] \u2013 producing five [[Megawatts|MW]] of power. The Bambers II [[wind farm]], an extension of the first, opened in November 2006, and produces an additional 5 MW of power.<ref>[https://www.geograph.org.uk/photo/1003427.]</ref> The two turbines at Mablethorpe wind farm, which produce 1.2 MW of power, were the first such turbines in Lincolnshire when built in July 2002. All three wind farms are owned by [[Ecotricity]], and stand at the corner of West Bank and the Trusthorpe Drains. Mablethorpe's ''Star of the East'' is on the seafront.\n\n==Media==\nThe local weekly [[newspapers]] are the ''Mablethorpe Leader'' and ''The Target''.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.louthtoday.co.uk/newsfront.aspx?sectionid=3702 |title=Louth Leader |publisher=}}</ref> [[Coverage (telecommunication)|Radio coverage]] for Lincolnshire is provided by [[BBC Radio Lincolnshire]] and [[Lincs FM]].

As a result, DWDB was turned into a [[music channel]] under the interim branding EMC, the ''Entertainment Music Channel''{{emdash}}which was also the country's first locally operated music channel. A few months later, GMA reached a deal with Asian broadcaster [[STAR TV (Asia)|STAR TV]] to allow DWDB to be a carrier of [[Channel V Philippines]], which took effect December 19, 1999. GMA had already aired selected Channel V programming from its international version (which made the former [[video jockey|VJ]]'s and [[overseas Filipino|Filipino descented]] [[Trey Farley]] and [[Joey Mead]] familiar to viewers of DWDB). This arrangement did not last long{{emdash}}a stake in GMA was recently purchased by the [[PLDT|Philippine Long Distance Telephone Company]], who already owned [[MTV Philippines]] through the [[Nation Broadcasting Corporation]] and its parent company [[MediaQuest Holdings, Inc.|MediaQuest Holdings]]. This conflict of interest, along with the increasing competition from the MTV affiliated network, led to the channel signing-off on July 25, 2001.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_hb5026/is_200107/ai_n18240840|title=Channel V's Philippines deal off|date=July 2001|publisher=bNet Business Network|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090305212038/http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_hb5026/is_200107/ai_n18240840|archive-date=2009-03-05|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n=== Abandoned plans, silent years and as the translator of GMA and QTV ===\nAfter PLDT's acquisition stake of GMA and its inactivity, they already have a bared plans to somehow relaunch this channel into a news channel.

GMA had reached an agreement with its owner, religious broadcaster [[ZOE Broadcasting Network]], to allow GMA to handle programming for the station, in exchange for providing upgraded facilities for the broadcaster and airing ZOE-produced programming in QTV's lineup. DWDB's UHF signal had the advantage of easier to receive in the southern areas of Metro Manila, especially in the metropolitan cities of [[Makati]] and [[Pasay]].\n\nThis practice was discontinued in 2007, as DWDB's signal was vacated for use in trials of [[Digital television in the Philippines|digital television]].\n\n=== Digital broadcast ===\n\nLast February 2013, [[GMA Network|GMA]] started its digital test broadcasts, [[simulcasting]] both [[DZBB-TV|GMA-7]] and [[DZOE-TV|GMA News TV-11]] using the Japanese [[ISDB|ISDB-T]] digital TV platform using the channel's frequency.\n\nOn May 15, 2019, GMA Network's digital test broadcasts used the same frequency as its digital feed, and it also started its initial digital test broadcast on UHF Channel 15 (479.143&nbsp;MHz),<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.gmanetwork.com/news/money/companies/694513/gma-network-starts-digital-tv-transmission-using-permanent-frequency/ | title=GMA Network Starts Digital TV Transmission using permanent frequency | work=GMA Network.com | date=May 15, 2019 | accessdate=May 15, 2019 | author=Jon Viktor D.

As a result, Channel 27 digital broadcast was planned to switch-off on May 27, 2019, as the station was supposedly conducting its test broadcast on the said date, and by that time, it will be re-utilize to broadcast [[GMA News TV]] in analog by June 3, 2019 after 18 years of inactivity. However, in order for GMA Network to allow some more time for the digital television viewers to rescan their digital boxes in order to continue watching their channels in a different frequency assignment, they decided to move their official relaunch date from June 3 to June 4. The station successfully signed on for the first time upon its return on analog television at 6:00&nbsp;am (PHT) after conducting test broadcast during off-air hours of digital signal for the past days after its announcement of this move, and it now served as the originating station of GMA News TV in Manila and also as the main feed station nationwide on its regional counterpart (like [[DYLS-TV|in Cebu]] and [[DXRA-TV|Davao]]).<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.gmanetwork.com/radio/articles/2019-04-29/1018/dobol-b-sa-news-tv-will-begin-airing-on-channel-27-starting-june-3 |title=Dobol B Sa News TV will begin airing on Channel 27 starting June 3 |accessdate=April 29, 2019 |date=April 29, 2019 |publisher=GMANetwork.com |url-status=live}}</ref> On the other hand, after the transition, [[DZOE-TV|the former channel]] conducted its last broadcast until it lowered its signal and it officially signed off on June 5, 2019.\n\n==Digital television==\n===Digital channels===\n<!-- PLEASE DO NOT REMOVE INFORMATION BEYOND THIS AREA.-->\nDWDB-TV's feed is broadcast on DZBB-TV digital subchannel operates on UHF channel 15 (479.143&nbsp;MHz) and broadcasts on the following subchannels:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!

DWDB-TV operates daily from 6:00 AM to 12:00 MN.\n\n== History ==\n=== Citynet Television (1995 - 1999) ===\nDWDB-TV signed on for the first time on August 27, 1995, under the on-air brand ''Citynet Television 27'' (or just ''Citynet 27''). The station was programmed like an [[Independent station (North America)|independent station]]{{emdash}}GMA intended Citynet 27 to be its main outlet for imported programming (particularly from the United States), freeing up slots in [[GMA Network]]'s schedule for more domestic productions.<ref name=\"gmahistory\">{{cite web|url=http://www.gmanetwork.com/history |title=About GMA Network - History |publisher=GMANetwork.com |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081028192711/http://www.gmanetwork.com/history |archivedate=October 28, 2008 }}</ref>  Aside from an English dub of the Hispanic [[telenovela]] ''[[Ka Ina]]'', the only locally produced program on the station was Citynet Television News, a flagship TV news show produced by [[GMA News and Public Affairs]].\n\n=== EMC 27 / Channel [V] Philippines (1999-2001) ===\nHowever, by 1999, the costs of operating the station in this format were becoming too high for GMA. As a result, DWDB was turned into a [[music channel]] under the interim branding EMC, the ''Entertainment Music Channel''{{emdash}}which was also the country's first locally operated music channel. A few months later, GMA reached a deal with Asian broadcaster [[STAR TV (Asia)|STAR TV]] to allow DWDB to be a carrier of [[Channel V Philippines]], which took effect December 19, 1999. GMA had already aired selected Channel V programming from its international version (which made the former [[video jockey|VJ]]'s and [[overseas Filipino|Filipino descented]] [[Trey Farley]] and [[Joey Mead]] familiar to viewers of DWDB). This arrangement did not last long{{emdash}}a stake in GMA was recently purchased by the [[PLDT|Philippine Long Distance Telephone Company]], who already owned [[MTV Philippines]] through the [[Nation Broadcasting Corporation]] and its parent company [[MediaQuest Holdings, Inc.|MediaQuest Holdings]]. This conflict of interest, along with the increasing competition from the MTV affiliated network, led to the channel signing-off on July 25, 2001.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_hb5026/is_200107/ai_n18240840|title=Channel V's Philippines deal off|date=July 2001|publisher=bNet Business Network|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090305212038/http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_hb5026/is_200107/ai_n18240840|archive-date=2009-03-05|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n=== Abandoned plans, silent years and as the translator of GMA and QTV ===\nAfter PLDT's acquisition stake of GMA and its inactivity, they already have a bared plans to somehow relaunch this channel into a news channel.

In November 2005, the station later became a repeater of [[DZOE-TV|DZOE 11]]{{emdash}}which served as the flagship for GMA's newly-secondary national network [[Q (TV network)|QTV]] (or ''Quality Television'', later renamed to just Q). GMA had reached an agreement with its owner, religious broadcaster [[ZOE Broadcasting Network]], to allow GMA to handle programming for the station, in exchange for providing upgraded facilities for the broadcaster and airing ZOE-produced programming in QTV's lineup. DWDB's UHF signal had the advantage of easier to receive in the southern areas of Metro Manila, especially in the metropolitan cities of [[Makati]] and [[Pasay]].\n\nThis practice was discontinued in 2007, as DWDB's signal was vacated for use in trials of [[Digital television in the Philippines|digital television]].\n\n=== Digital broadcast ===\n\nLast February 2013, [[GMA Network|GMA]] started its digital test broadcasts, [[simulcasting]] both [[DZBB-TV|GMA-7]] and [[DZOE-TV|GMA News TV-11]] using the Japanese [[ISDB|ISDB-T]] digital TV platform using the channel's frequency.\n\nOn May 15, 2019, GMA Network's digital test broadcasts used the same frequency as its digital feed, and it also started its initial digital test broadcast on UHF Channel 15 (479.143&nbsp;MHz),<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.gmanetwork.com/news/money/companies/694513/gma-network-starts-digital-tv-transmission-using-permanent-frequency/ | title=GMA Network Starts Digital TV Transmission using permanent frequency | work=GMA Network.com | date=May 15, 2019 | accessdate=May 15, 2019 | author=Jon Viktor D.

As a result, Channel 27 digital broadcast was planned to switch-off on May 27, 2019, as the station was supposedly conducting its test broadcast on the said date, and by that time, it will be re-utilize to broadcast [[GMA News TV]] in analog by June 3, 2019 after 18 years of inactivity. However, in order for GMA Network to allow some more time for the digital television viewers to rescan their digital boxes in order to continue watching their channels in a different frequency assignment, they decided to move their official relaunch date from June 3 to June 4. The station successfully signed on for the first time upon its return on analog television at 6:00&nbsp;am (PHT) after conducting test broadcast during off-air hours of digital signal for the past days after its announcement of this move, and it now served as the originating station of GMA News TV in Manila and also as the main feed station nationwide on its regional counterpart (like [[DYLS-TV|in Cebu]] and [[DXRA-TV|Davao]]).<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.gmanetwork.com/radio/articles/2019-04-29/1018/dobol-b-sa-news-tv-will-begin-airing-on-channel-27-starting-june-3 |title=Dobol B Sa News TV will begin airing on Channel 27 starting June 3 |accessdate=April 29, 2019 |date=April 29, 2019 |publisher=GMANetwork.com |url-status=live}}</ref> On the other hand, after the transition, [[DZOE-TV|the former channel]] conducted its last broadcast until it lowered its signal and it officially signed off on June 5, 2019.\n\n==Digital television==\n===Digital channels===\n<!-- PLEASE DO NOT REMOVE INFORMATION BEYOND THIS AREA.-->\nDWDB-TV's feed is broadcast on DZBB-TV digital subchannel operates on UHF channel 15 (479.143&nbsp;MHz) and broadcasts on the following subchannels:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!
