The episode was written by [[Gene Stupnitsky]] and [[Lee Eisenberg]], and directed by [[Ken Whittingham]]. It first aired on September 28, 2006 on [[NBC]] in the United States.\n\nIn the episode, [[Michael Scott (The Office)|Michael Scott]] ([[Steve Carell]]) and [[Dwight Schrute]] ([[Rainn Wilson]]) from the [[Scranton, Pennsylvania|Scranton]] branch of [[Dunder Mifflin]], as well as [[List of The Office (American TV series) characters#Josh Porter|Josh Porter]] ([[Charles Esten]]) and [[Jim Halpert]] ([[John Krasinski]]) from the [[Stamford, Connecticut|Stamford]] branch, leave for [[Philadelphia]] for the annual office supply convention. Michael, angry at both Jim for leaving the Scranton branch, as well as Josh for being superior to him, tries to one-up Josh at every opportunity. Meanwhile, [[Kelly Kapoor]] ([[Mindy Kaling]]) sets up [[Pam Beesly]] ([[Jenna Fischer]]) on a double date with her neighbor which goes nowhere. [[Toby Flenderson]]'s ([[Paul Lieberstein]]) interest in Pam is piqued, beginning an unrequited crush on his part.\n\nThe first draft of the script included a scene suggesting that [[Angela Martin]] ([[Angela Kinsey]]) was pregnant with Dwight's child, but this was cut by [[showrunner]] [[Greg Daniels]]. Initially, there were plans for the cast members from the [[The Office (British TV series)|British version of ''The Office'']] to appear in this episode, but due to scheduling conflicts, this fell through. The episode was seen by an estimated 7.8 million viewers according to [[Nielsen Media Research]]. It was received generally well by critics.\n\n== Plot ==\n[[Michael Scott (The Office)|Michael Scott]] ([[Steve Carell]]) and [[Dwight Schrute]] ([[Rainn Wilson]]) from the [[Scranton, Pennsylvania|Scranton]] branch of [[Dunder Mifflin]], [[List of The Office (American TV series) characters#Josh Porter|Josh Porter]] ([[Charles Esten]]) and [[Jim Halpert]] ([[John Krasinski]]), recently transferred, from the [[Stamford, Connecticut|Stamford]] branch, and [[Jan Levinson]] ([[Melora Hardin]]) from the corporate headquarters all descend upon [[Philadelphia]] for the annual office supply convention. However, Michael is bitter that Jim left Scranton for Stamford and tries to one-up Josh at every opportunity. Michael also spreads the word that he is throwing a party in his hotel room that night. Later in the evening, Michael surprises everyone with the news that he has broken [[Staples Inc.|Staples]]' exclusive hold on [[Hammermill Paper Company|Hammermill]] products. Meanwhile, [[Angela Martin]] ([[Angela Kinsey]]) follows after Dwight wanting to spend time with him and waits in his hotel room. While hoping to prank Dwight, Jim acquires a key to his hotel room. Upon opening the door, he hears and sees Angela without realizing it is her; Jim instead thinks it's a [[prostitution|hooker]] Dwight ordered, gleefully pondering who to tell.\n\nBack in Scranton, [[Kelly Kapoor]] ([[Mindy Kaling]]) sets [[Pam Beesly]] ([[Jenna Fischer]]) up on a double date with her neighbor Alan (Robert Bagnell), a [[cartoonist]] for the local newspaper. However, Kelly is quietly disappointed that Pam intends to wear just her normal work clothes to the date. On the double date, Kelly appears to be the only one having a good time with [[Ryan Howard (The Office)|Ryan Howard]] ([[B. J. Novak]]), who is annoyed by Kelly for feeding him [[french fries]]. Pam awkwardly chats with Alan, who at one point sneaks a peek down Pam's shirt; they fail to hit it off. At Michael's party, Jim attends as the only guest and explains that he did not leave Scranton because of Michael (whom Jim claims is a great boss), but rather because of Pam, who rejected Jim (twice); Michael promises Jim that he will talk to Pam about the situation, but Jim tells him not to. Finally, the two mend their friendship just as two other guests arrive.\n\n== Production ==\n[[File:Mackenzie Crook.JPG|thumb|upright|150px|[[Executive producer]] and [[showrunner]] of ''The Office'' [[Greg Daniels]] had hoped to get cast members from the original [[The Office (British TV series)|British ''Office'' series]], such as [[Mackenzie Crook]] (''pictured'') to appear in the episode.]]\n\n\"The Convention\" was the fourth episode of the series written by the writing team of [[Gene Stupnitsky]] and [[Lee Eisenberg]], and the third episode of the series directed by [[Ken Whittingham]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://tv.yahoo.com/the-office/show/the-coup/episode/95738 |title=''The Office'': \"The Convention\" |accessdate=July 11, 2008 |publisher=[[Yahoo!]]}}</ref> This episode originally had a scene with Angela and Dwight in the office kitchen.

Directed by Rudolph, it starred [[Jennifer Jason Leigh]] as the writer [[Dorothy Parker]] and depicted the members of the [[Algonquin Round Table]], a group of writers, actors and critics who met almost every weekday from 1919 to 1929 at Manhattan's [[Algonquin Hotel]].\n\nThe film was an Official Selection at the [[1994 Cannes Film Festival]] and was nominated for the [[Palme d'Or]]. The film was a critical but not a commercial success. Leigh won the [[National Society of Film Critics Award for Best Actress]].\n\n[[Peter Benchley]], who played editor [[Frank Crowninshield]], was the grandson of [[Robert Benchley]], the humorist who once worked underneath Crowninshield.

He began work on a screenplay with novelist and former Washington Star journalist Randy Sue Coburn about legendary writer Dorothy Parker. In 1992, Rudolph attended a Fourth of July party hosted by filmmaker [[Robert Altman]] who introduced him to actress [[Jennifer Jason Leigh]]. Rudolph was surprised by her physical resemblance to Parker and was impressed by her knowledge of the [[Jazz Age]]. Leigh was so committed to doing the film that she agreed to make it for \"a tenth of what I normally get for a film\".<ref name=\"carpenter\" />\n\nThe screenplay originally focused on the platonic relationship between Parker and Robert Benchley, but this did not appeal to any financial backers.<ref name=\"carpenter\" /> There still was no interest even when Altman came on board as producer. The emphasis on Parker was the next change to the script, but Rudolph still had no luck finding financing for \"a period biography of a literate woman.\"<ref name=\"carpenter\" /> Altman used his clout to persuade [[Fine Line Features]] and [[Miramax]]\u2014two studios he was making films for\u2014to team, with the former releasing ''Mrs. Parker and the Vicious Circle'' domestically and the latter handling foreign distribution.<ref name=\"carpenter\" /> Altman claimed that he forced the film to be made by putting his own money into it and \"I put other projects of mine hostage to it.

Rudolph invited them to write their own dialogue, which resulted in a chaotic first couple of days of principal photography. Actor Campbell Scott remembered \"Everyone hung on to what they knew about their characters and just sort of threw it out there.\"<ref name=\"carpenter\" /> Actress Jennifer Beals discussed this in her appearance on the Jon Favreau documentary program ''[[Dinner for Five]]'', where she stated that much dialogue was improvised in the style of the real-life characters actors were playing, but that many of those characters were not integral to the plot. As such, many of the actors had much larger parts that were edited to nearly nothing. The cast trusted their director during the 40-day shoot. They stayed in a run-down hotel dubbed Camp Rudolph and engaged in all-night poker games. Leigh chose not to participate in these activities, preferring to stay in character on and off camera. She did a great amount of research for the role and said \"I wanted to be as close to her as I possibly could.\"<ref name=\"carpenter\" /> To this end, Leigh stayed for a week at the Algonquin Hotel and read Parker's entire body of work. In addition, the actress listened repeatedly to the two existing audio recordings of Parker in order to perfect the writer's distinctive voice.

Directed by Rudolph, it starred [[Jennifer Jason Leigh]] as the writer [[Dorothy Parker]] and depicted the members of the [[Algonquin Round Table]], a group of writers, actors and critics who met almost every weekday from 1919 to 1929 at Manhattan's [[Algonquin Hotel]].\n\nThe film was an Official Selection at the [[1994 Cannes Film Festival]] and was nominated for the [[Palme d'Or]]. The film was a critical but not a commercial success. Leigh won the [[National Society of Film Critics Award for Best Actress]].\n\n[[Peter Benchley]], who played editor [[Frank Crowninshield]], was the grandson of [[Robert Benchley]], the humorist who once worked underneath Crowninshield.

He began work on a screenplay with novelist and former Washington Star journalist Randy Sue Coburn about legendary writer Dorothy Parker. In 1992, Rudolph attended a Fourth of July party hosted by filmmaker [[Robert Altman]] who introduced him to actress [[Jennifer Jason Leigh]]. Rudolph was surprised by her physical resemblance to Parker and was impressed by her knowledge of the [[Jazz Age]]. Leigh was so committed to doing the film that she agreed to make it for \"a tenth of what I normally get for a film\".<ref name=\"carpenter\" />\n\nThe screenplay originally focused on the platonic relationship between Parker and Robert Benchley, but this did not appeal to any financial backers.<ref name=\"carpenter\" /> There still was no interest even when Altman came on board as producer. The emphasis on Parker was the next change to the script, but Rudolph still had no luck finding financing for \"a period biography of a literate woman.\"<ref name=\"carpenter\" /> Altman used his clout to persuade [[Fine Line Features]] and [[Miramax]]\u2014two studios he was making films for\u2014to team, with the former releasing ''Mrs. Parker and the Vicious Circle'' domestically and the latter handling foreign distribution.<ref name=\"carpenter\" /> Altman claimed that he forced the film to be made by putting his own money into it and \"I put other projects of mine hostage to it.

Rudolph invited them to write their own dialogue, which resulted in a chaotic first couple of days of principal photography. Actor Campbell Scott remembered \"Everyone hung on to what they knew about their characters and just sort of threw it out there.\"<ref name=\"carpenter\" /> Actress Jennifer Beals discussed this in her appearance on the Jon Favreau documentary program ''[[Dinner for Five]]'', where she stated that much dialogue was improvised in the style of the real-life characters actors were playing, but that many of those characters were not integral to the plot. As such, many of the actors had much larger parts that were edited to nearly nothing. The cast trusted their director during the 40-day shoot. They stayed in a run-down hotel dubbed Camp Rudolph and engaged in all-night poker games. Leigh chose not to participate in these activities, preferring to stay in character on and off camera. She did a great amount of research for the role and said \"I wanted to be as close to her as I possibly could.\"<ref name=\"carpenter\" /> To this end, Leigh stayed for a week at the Algonquin Hotel and read Parker's entire body of work. In addition, the actress listened repeatedly to the two existing audio recordings of Parker in order to perfect the writer's distinctive voice. Leigh found that Parker \"had a sensibility that I understand very, very well. A sadness. A depression.\"<ref name=\"carpenter\" />\n\n==Reception==\nA rough cut of ''Mrs. Parker and the Vicious Circle'' was screened at the [[1993 Cannes Film Festival]] where it divided film critics.

It remains her third biggest US hit, after \"[[I Will Always Love You#Whitney Houston version|I Will Always Love You]]\" and \"[[I Wanna Dance with Somebody (Who Loves Me)]]\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/list/506203/whitney-houstons-biggest-billboard-hits-a-look-at-her-legendary-chart-career |title=Whitney Houston's Biggest Hits |publisher=Billboard |date= |accessdate=2016-10-12}}</ref> All three songs, in order of their former popularity, re-entered the ''Billboard'' Hot 100 chart, after Houston's death in 2012, debuting the same week at numbers 7, 35 and 41, respectively, giving Houston three posthumous chart hits.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.billboard.com/artist/431329/whitney+houston/chart |title=Whitney Houston - Chart history |publisher=Billboard |date= |accessdate=2017-02-12}}</ref>\n\n[[Clive Davis]], founder of Houston's label [[Arista Records]], was initially against Houston recording the song for her debut studio album, ''[[Whitney Houston (album)|Whitney Houston]],'' but he eventually gave in after persuasion from Houston and Masser. It was released as the [[B-side]] to the single \"[[You Give Good Love]],\" a previous Top 5 hit by Houston. The song, eventually released as a single in its own right, on March 18, 1986, was the seventh release from Houston's debut album, and spent three weeks at No. 1 on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] chart in May of that year.<ref>[[Fred Bronson|Bronson, Fred]] (2003). ''The Billboard Book of No. 1 Hits'', 5th Edition (Billboard Publications), page 636.</ref>\n\nHouston's album version features a piano intro, while the single version begins with a keyboard intro. After the single became a success, it replaced the original album version on subsequent pressings of the album. However, the original version was restored for the 2010 Deluxe Anniversary Edition reissue of the album and international releases.\n\nHer live performance in 1990 in ''[[That's What Friends Are For#1990 benefit concert|the 15th anniversary of Arista Records]]'' concert in [[Radio City Music Hall]] was included in the 25th anniversary deluxe edition of ''Whitney Houston'' and the 2014 CD/DVD release, ''[[Whitney Houston Live: Her Greatest Performances]].''<ref>{{cite web|first=Andy|last=Kellman |url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/live-her-greatest-performances-mw0002759110 |title=Live: Her Greatest Performances - Whitney Houston &#124; Songs, Reviews, Credits |publisher=[[AllMusic]] |date=2014-11-10 |accessdate=2016-10-12}}</ref>\n\n===Background===\nWhitney Houston was still an unknown hopeful when the then-president of [[Arista Records]], [[Clive Davis]], and Masser heard her sing \"Greatest Love\" in a New York club on Amsterdam Avenue at about 68th St. a few years before her debut. Davis later described the first time he heard Houston sing:\n\n<blockquote>I went down there [Sweetwater's club] instead of having her audition in a studio; I was seeing her before an audience. She did backup singing and you could see she was a beautiful young girl. But then she stepped out and she did two solo numbers, one of which was the song \"The Greatest Love of All.\" Whitney sang the song with such fervor, with such a natural vocal gift, with such passion, that I was stunned. I knew really right then and there that this was a special talent and I was blown away by her. As I reflect back on this, I can relive the experience for the very first time. There was no hesitation. I wanted to sign Whitney.</blockquote>\n\nMasser said, \"When I first met Whitney, she was about 19 and unknown. I went into Sweetwater's, and I thought I must be totally out of it\u2014I said, 'I must be going crazy, I think I'm hearing one of my songs.' She was singing 'The Greatest Love of All' just as I walked in, and that meant something to me. Two and a half years later when I was doing [[Teddy Pendergrass]] there was a duet and everybody wanted me to use this or that known person. Only because I had heard Whitney singing 'The Greatest Love of All'. I chose her.\"<ref name=\"gloaocala\"/> (The eventual duet between Pendergrass and Houston to which Masser referred, which served as Houston's debut single, was titled \"[[Hold Me (Teddy Pendergrass & Whitney Houston song)|Hold Me in Your Arms]]\".)\n\n===Music video===\nHouston's music video was filmed at [[Harlem]]'s [[Apollo Theater]] in New York City. In the video, she is a successful singer who is about to perform in front of an audience. She reminisces about the time when she was a child performing in a talent competition and receiving encouragement from her mother. The video features Houston's mother [[Cissy Houston]] playing herself, supporting a young Whitney, as well as hugging present Whitney at the end of the video. It was directed by Peter Israelson, filmed with James Contner as DP and Steadicam operator Robin Buerki shooting 35mm film. On February 2020, the music video was upscaled to [[4K resolution|4K]]. <ref>[http://www.vevo.com/watch/whitney-houston/Greatest-Love-Of-All/USAV70000013 Whitney Houston - \"Greatest Love of All\"] on Vevo</ref>\n\n===Reception===\n\n====Critical reception====\nMany critics called the song the centerpiece of Houston's debut album. Stephen Holden of ''[[The New York Times]]'' wrote that \"Houston sings it with a forceful directness that gives its message of self-worth an astounding resonance and conviction\" and called the song a compelling assertion of spiritual devotion, black pride, and family loyalty, all at once.<ref>Holden, Stephen. \"Whitney Houston \u2013 Pop's New Queen\". NY Times. March 18, 1986. Pg A18.</ref> Don Shewey of ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' wrote that as the song builds, Houston \"slowly pours on the soul, slips in some churchy phrasing, holds notes a little longer and shows off her glorious voice.\"<ref>Shewey, Don.

It was a moderate pop hit, making the top 40 on the ''Billboard'' Hot 100.<ref name=\"Hyatt\">Hyatt, Wesley (1999). ''The Billboard Book of number 1 Adult Contemporary Hits'' (Billboard Publications), page 306.</ref> Houston's version reached number one on the Hot 100 chart for three weeks in 1986. The single was the fourth hit (and third number 1) from her debut album. To date, this song was her second longest stay atop this chart, behind 1992's \"[[I Will Always Love You]].\" The song also reached number one on both component charts, the [[Hot 100 Singles Sales]] and the [[Hot 100 Airplay]], her second consecutive release to do so, and stayed for 14 weeks inside the top 40. On other ''Billboard'' charts, Houston also performed well, reaching number three on the [[Hot R&B/Hip-Hop songs|R&B chart]]. The song topped the [[Hot Adult Contemporary Tracks|adult contemporary chart]] for five weeks, Houston's longest stay at the top of that chart at the time.<ref name=\"Hyatt\"/> The song ranked No. 11 on ''Billboard's'' year end pop singles chart.<ref>Top 20 Pop Singles for 1986.

It remains her third biggest US hit, after \"[[I Will Always Love You#Whitney Houston version|I Will Always Love You]]\" and \"[[I Wanna Dance with Somebody (Who Loves Me)]]\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/list/506203/whitney-houstons-biggest-billboard-hits-a-look-at-her-legendary-chart-career |title=Whitney Houston's Biggest Hits |publisher=Billboard |date= |accessdate=2016-10-12}}</ref> All three songs, in order of their former popularity, re-entered the ''Billboard'' Hot 100 chart, after Houston's death in 2012, debuting the same week at numbers 7, 35 and 41, respectively, giving Houston three posthumous chart hits.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.billboard.com/artist/431329/whitney+houston/chart |title=Whitney Houston - Chart history |publisher=Billboard |date= |accessdate=2017-02-12}}</ref>\n\n[[Clive Davis]], founder of Houston's label [[Arista Records]], was initially against Houston recording the song for her debut studio album, ''[[Whitney Houston (album)|Whitney Houston]],'' but he eventually gave in after persuasion from Houston and Masser. It was released as the [[B-side]] to the single \"[[You Give Good Love]],\" a previous Top 5 hit by Houston. The song, eventually released as a single in its own right, on March 18, 1986, was the seventh release from Houston's debut album, and spent three weeks at No. 1 on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] chart in May of that year.<ref>[[Fred Bronson|Bronson, Fred]] (2003). ''The Billboard Book of No. 1 Hits'', 5th Edition (Billboard Publications), page 636.</ref>\n\nHouston's album version features a piano intro, while the single version begins with a keyboard intro. After the single became a success, it replaced the original album version on subsequent pressings of the album. However, the original version was restored for the 2010 Deluxe Anniversary Edition reissue of the album and international releases.\n\nHer live performance in 1990 in ''[[That's What Friends Are For#1990 benefit concert|the 15th anniversary of Arista Records]]'' concert in [[Radio City Music Hall]] was included in the 25th anniversary deluxe edition of ''Whitney Houston'' and the 2014 CD/DVD release, ''[[Whitney Houston Live: Her Greatest Performances]].''<ref>{{cite web|first=Andy|last=Kellman |url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/live-her-greatest-performances-mw0002759110 |title=Live: Her Greatest Performances - Whitney Houston &#124; Songs, Reviews, Credits |publisher=[[AllMusic]] |date=2014-11-10 |accessdate=2016-10-12}}</ref>\n\n===Background===\nWhitney Houston was still an unknown hopeful when the then-president of [[Arista Records]], [[Clive Davis]], and Masser heard her sing \"Greatest Love\" in a New York club on Amsterdam Avenue at about 68th St. a few years before her debut. Davis later described the first time he heard Houston sing:\n\n<blockquote>I went down there [Sweetwater's club] instead of having her audition in a studio; I was seeing her before an audience. She did backup singing and you could see she was a beautiful young girl. But then she stepped out and she did two solo numbers, one of which was the song \"The Greatest Love of All.\" Whitney sang the song with such fervor, with such a natural vocal gift, with such passion, that I was stunned. I knew really right then and there that this was a special talent and I was blown away by her. As I reflect back on this, I can relive the experience for the very first time. There was no hesitation. I wanted to sign Whitney.</blockquote>\n\nMasser said, \"When I first met Whitney, she was about 19 and unknown. I went into Sweetwater's, and I thought I must be totally out of it\u2014I said, 'I must be going crazy, I think I'm hearing one of my songs.' She was singing 'The Greatest Love of All' just as I walked in, and that meant something to me. Two and a half years later when I was doing [[Teddy Pendergrass]] there was a duet and everybody wanted me to use this or that known person. Only because I had heard Whitney singing 'The Greatest Love of All'. I chose her.\"<ref name=\"gloaocala\"/> (The eventual duet between Pendergrass and Houston to which Masser referred, which served as Houston's debut single, was titled \"[[Hold Me (Teddy Pendergrass & Whitney Houston song)|Hold Me in Your Arms]]\".)\n\n===Music video===\nHouston's music video was filmed at [[Harlem]]'s [[Apollo Theater]] in New York City. In the video, she is a successful singer who is about to perform in front of an audience. She reminisces about the time when she was a child performing in a talent competition and receiving encouragement from her mother. The video features Houston's mother [[Cissy Houston]] playing herself, supporting a young Whitney, as well as hugging present Whitney at the end of the video. It was directed by Peter Israelson, filmed with James Contner as DP and Steadicam operator Robin Buerki shooting 35mm film. On February 2020, the music video was upscaled to [[4K resolution|4K]]. <ref>[http://www.vevo.com/watch/whitney-houston/Greatest-Love-Of-All/USAV70000013 Whitney Houston - \"Greatest Love of All\"] on Vevo</ref>\n\n===Reception===\n\n====Critical reception====\nMany critics called the song the centerpiece of Houston's debut album. Stephen Holden of ''[[The New York Times]]'' wrote that \"Houston sings it with a forceful directness that gives its message of self-worth an astounding resonance and conviction\" and called the song a compelling assertion of spiritual devotion, black pride, and family loyalty, all at once.<ref>Holden, Stephen. \"Whitney Houston \u2013 Pop's New Queen\". NY Times. March 18, 1986. Pg A18.</ref> Don Shewey of ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' wrote that as the song builds, Houston \"slowly pours on the soul, slips in some churchy phrasing, holds notes a little longer and shows off her glorious voice.\"<ref>Shewey, Don.

It was a moderate pop hit, making the top 40 on the ''Billboard'' Hot 100.<ref name=\"Hyatt\">Hyatt, Wesley (1999). ''The Billboard Book of number 1 Adult Contemporary Hits'' (Billboard Publications), page 306.</ref> Houston's version reached number one on the Hot 100 chart for three weeks in 1986. The single was the fourth hit (and third number 1) from her debut album. To date, this song was her second longest stay atop this chart, behind 1992's \"[[I Will Always Love You]].\" The song also reached number one on both component charts, the [[Hot 100 Singles Sales]] and the [[Hot 100 Airplay]], her second consecutive release to do so, and stayed for 14 weeks inside the top 40. On other ''Billboard'' charts, Houston also performed well, reaching number three on the [[Hot R&B/Hip-Hop songs|R&B chart]]. The song topped the [[Hot Adult Contemporary Tracks|adult contemporary chart]] for five weeks, Houston's longest stay at the top of that chart at the time.<ref name=\"Hyatt\"/> The song ranked No. 11 on ''Billboard's'' year end pop singles chart.<ref>Top 20 Pop Singles for 1986. ''Newsday''. December 28, 1986. Pg 19.</ref> Houston's single fared well globally as well, reaching No. 8 in the United Kingdom and the top ten or No. 1 in several other European countries. It became her first No. 1 single in Australia.\nAfter her death, the single returned to the Billboard Hot 100, debuting at number 41.<ref>{{cite web|title=Whitney Houston Returns to Hot 100's Top 10 With 'I Will Always Love You'|url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/505143/whitney-houston-returns-to-hot-100s-top-10-with-i-will-always-love-you|publisher=Billboard|accessdate=February 16, 2012|date=February 15, 2012}}</ref>\n\n====Accolades====\nHouston won the [[American Music Awards of 1987#Soul/R&B Category|American Music Award for Favorite Soul/R&B Video Single]], and was nominated for a [[Grammy Award for Record of the Year]] and a [[1987 Soul Train Music Awards#Best Single, Female|Soul Train Music Award for Single of the Year]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rockonthenet.com/archive/1987/amas.htm|title=Rock On The Net: 14th American Music Awards (presented in 1987)|website=www.rockonthenet.com}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1987-01-09/entertainment/ca-2676_1_record-category|title=Grammy Nominations: Highs and Lows: Winwood, Gabriel and Simon Garner Most Nominations|last=Hunt|first=Dennis|newspaper=Los Angeles Times|publisher=Tribune Company|page=2|date=January 9, 1987|accessdate=February 17, 2014}}</ref><ref name=\"1987soultrain\">{{cite news | first = Maurice | last = Weaver | url = http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1987-03-23/features/8701220565_1_soul-train-awards-music-awards-show-executive-producer-don-cornelius | title = 'Soul Train' Awards Are a 1st for Black Music | publisher = [[Tribune Company]] | work = [[Chicago Tribune]] | date = March 23, 1987 | accessdate = Dec 15, 2015}}</ref>\n\n===Controversy===\nIn April 1987, [[Gordon Lightfoot]] filed a lawsuit against [[Michael Masser]], alleging that Masser's song \"The Greatest Love of All\" stole twenty-four bars from Lightfoot's 1970 hit \"[[If You Could Read My Mind]].\" According to [[Maclean's]], Lightfoot commented, \"It really rubbed me the wrong way.
