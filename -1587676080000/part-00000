{"title_page": "Pelagianism", "text_new": "{{redirect|Pelagians|the Italian movement of lay mystics known as Pelagians|Pelagians (Quietism)}}\n'''Pelagianism''' is a [[heterodox]] [[Christian theology|Christian theological]] position which holds that the [[original sin]] did not taint [[human nature]] and that mortal [[will (philosophy)|will]] is capable of choosing [[Goodness and value theory|good]] or [[evil]] without [[Grace (Christianity)#Augustine versus Pelagius|divine aid]] or assistance. This theological theory is named after the British monk [[Pelagius]] ({{circa|355}}&nbsp;\u2013 {{circa|420}} CE), although he denied, at least at some point in his life, many of the doctrines associated with his name. Pelagianism asserts human will, as created with its abilities by God, is sufficient to live a sinless life, although God's grace assists every good work. It has come to be identified with the view (whether taught by Pelagius or not) that human beings can earn salvation by their own efforts.\n\n==Pelagian controversy==\n[[File:Nuremberg chronicles f 135r 2.jpg|thumb|right|Pelagius Hereticus and [[John Chrysostom]] depicted in the ''[[Nuremberg Chronicle]]'', 1493]]\n\n[[Pelagius]] ({{circa|355}}\u2013{{circa|420}} CE){{sfn|Elliott|2011|p=377}} was a monk, probably from the [[British Isles]], who moved to [[Rome]] in the mid-380s.{{sfn|Keech|2012|p=38}} At the time, many Romans were converting to Christianity, but they did not necessarily follow the faith strictly.{{sfn|Kirwan|1998}} Pelagius criticized what he saw as an increasing laxity among Christians, instead promoting higher moral standards and [[Christian asceticism]].{{sfn|Elliott|2011|p=377}}{{sfn|Wetzel|2001|p=51}} He defended asceticism from the accusation of [[Manicheanism]] and argued for the possibility of a [[sinless |sinless life]]. The rejection of [[original sin]] was not original to Pelagius, initially promoted by [[Rufinus the Syrian]].{{sfn|Bonner|2004}} Pelagius and his ideas were most popular among circles of the Roman elite, who adopted [[lay asceticism]] as a way of life.{{sfn|Keech|2012|p=38}}{{sfn|Wetzel|2001|p=51}} Other prominent Pelagians included the former Roman aristocrat [[Caelestius]], described by [[Gerald Bonner]] as \"the real apostle of the so-called Pelagian movement\", and the apologist [[Julian of Eclanum]].{{sfn|Bonner|2004}} According to scholar [[Ali Bonner]], the ideas Pelagius actually promoted were not a \"new heresy\", as Augustine claimed, but mainstream in contemporary Christianity, advocated by such figures as [[Athanasius of Alexandria]] and [[Jerome]].<ref>{{cite news |last1=Bonner |first1=Ali |title=In praise of Pelagius |url=https://www.churchtimes.co.uk/articles/2018/31-august/features/features/in-praise-of-pelagius |accessdate=19 April 2020 |work=[[The Church Times]] |date=31 August 2018}}</ref> \n\nAugustine maintained friendly relations with Pelagius until at least 413, initially only condemning Caelestius' teachings.{{sfn|Bonner|2004}} In 415, the Gallic bishops [[Heros of Arles]] and [[Lazarus of Aix]] accused Pelagius of heresy; Pelagius defended himself by claiming not to teach what he was accused of and by ascribing some of the teachings to Caelestinus and disavowing them, leading to his acquittal at the Council of Diospolis in [[Lod]]. Following the verdict, Augustine led condemnation of Pelagius in Africa and persuaded Pope [[Innocent I]] to condemn Pelagianism. In January 417, shortly before his death, Innocent [[excommunicated]] Pelagius and two of his followers. Innocent's successor, [[Pope Zosimus|Zosimus]], initially agreed to reopen the case against Pelagius, but backtracked following pressure from the African bishops.{{sfn|Bonner|2004}}{{sfn|Keech|2012|pp=39\u201340}}  Pelagianism was later condemned at the [[Council of Carthage (418)]],{{sfn|Reese|1996|p=421}} after which Zosimus issued the ''Epistola tractoria'' excommunicating both Pelagius and Caelestinus.{{sfn|Bonner|2004}} The condemnation of Pelagianism was ratified at the [[First Council of Ephesus|Council of Ephesus]].{{sfn|Keech|2012|p=40}}\n\nAt the time, Pelagius' teachings had considerable support among Christians, especially other monks.{{sfn|Puchniak|2008|p=123}} The strict moral teachings of the Pelagians were influential in southern Italy, where they were openly preached until the death of Julian of Eclanum in 455; in Sicily, where the anonymous \"[[Sicilian Briton]]\" wrote.<ref name=\"Knowles\" />{{better source|date=April 2020}} Despite repeated attempts to suppress Pelagianism and similar teachings by [[Orthodoxy|orthodox]] clergy, some followers were still active in the [[Ostrogothic Kingdom]] (493\u2013553), most notably in [[Picenum]] and [[Dalmatia (Roman province)|Dalmatia]] during the rule of [[Theoderic the Great]].{{sfn|Cohen|2016|p=523}} Pelagianism was also reported to be popular in Britain, as [[Germanus of Auxerre]] had to make at least one visit (in 429) to denounce the heresy. Some scholars, including [[Nowell Myres]] and [[John Morris (historian) |John Morris]], have suggested that Pelagianism in Britain was understood as an attack on Roman decadence and corruption, but this has been criticized by others such as [[Wolf Liebeschuetz]].{{sfn|Bonner|2004}}\n\n==Beliefs==\n\nPelagius taught that humans were free of the burden of [[original sin]], because it would be unjust for any person to be blamed for another's actions.{{sfn|Puchniak|2008|p=123}} He believed that Adam's transgression had caused humans to become mortal, and given them a bad example, but not corrupted their nature.{{sfn|Visotzky|2009|p=49}}{{efn|Caelestinus went even further, arguing that Adam had been created mortal.{{sfn|Visotzky|2009|p=50}}}} Because humans retained [[libertarian free will|complete freedom of action]], making them fully responsible for all actions.{{sfn|Puchniak|2008|p=123}}  In other words, sin is not an inevitable result of [[human nature]], but instead comes about by [[free choice]].{{sfn|Visotzky|2009|p=44}} Because a person always has the ability to choose the right action in each circumstance, it is therefore theoretically possible (though rare) to live a sinless life.{{sfn|Puchniak|2008|p=123}}{{sfn|Kirwan|1998|loc=Pelagius}} Pelagius taught that a human's ability to act correctly is a gift of God,{{sfn|Kirwan|1998|loc=Pelagius}} as well as [[divine revelation]] and the example and teachings of Jesus. Further spiritual development, including faith in Christianity, was up to individual choice, not divine benevolence.{{sfn|Puchniak|2008|p=123}}{{sfn|Visotzky|2009|p=48}} Because sin must be deliberate and people are only responsible for their own actions, infants are without fault and [[infant baptism]] is unnecessary.{{sfn|Kirwan|1998|loc=Grace and free will}} \nThere is significant doubt as to what Pelagius actually taught,{{cn|date=April 2020}} and what Augustine called \"Pelagianism\" was more his own invention than that of Pelagius.{{sfn|Visotzky|2009|p=50}}{{sfn|Bonner|2018|p=302}} Later Christians used \"Pelagianism\" as an insult for theologically orthodox Christians who held positions that they disagreed with. Historian [[Eric Nelson (historian)|Eric Nelson]] defined genuine Pelagianism as rejection of original sin or denial of original sin's effect on man's ability to avoid sin.{{sfn|Nelson|2019|p=4}}\n===Comparison of Pelagianism and Augustinianism===\nPelagius' teachings on human nature, divine grace, and sin were opposed to those of Augustine, who declared Pelagius \"the enemy of the grace of God\".{{sfn|Puchniak|2008|p=123}} The Pelagians charged Augustine with departing from the accepted teaching (e.g.: [[John 8:11]]) of the Apostles and the Bible, demonstrating the doctrine of original sin amounted to [[Manichaeism]], which taught that the flesh was in itself sinful (and thus denied Jesus [[Incarnation (Christianity)|came in the flesh]]). This charge would have carried added weight since contemporaries knew Augustine had himself been a Manichaean layman before converting to Christianity.{{sfn|Stump|Kretzmann|2001|pp= 130\u2013135}} Pelagianism shaped Augustine's ideas in opposition to its own on free will, grace, and original sin.{{sfn|Visotzky|2009|p=43}}{{sfn|Keech|2012|p=15}} However, according to [[Peter Brown (historian)|Peter Brown]], \"For a sensitive man of the fifth century, Manichaeism, Pelagianism, and the views of Augustine were not as widely separated as we would now see them: they would have appeared to him as points along the great circle of problems raised by the Christian religion\".{{sfn|Visotzky|2009|p=53}}\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

The Augustinian defense of God's grace against accusations of arbitrariness is that God's ways are incomprehensible to mere mortals.{{sfn|Nelson|2019|p=4}} Yet, as later critics such as [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz]] asserted, asking \"[[Euthyphro dilemma|it is good and just because God wills it or whether God wills it because it is good and just]]?\", this defense (although accepted by many Catholic and [[Reformed]] theologians) creates a [[Divine command theory|God-centered morality]], which, in Leibniz' view \"would destroy the justice of God\" and make him into a tyrant.{{sfn|Nelson|2019|pp=5\u20136}}\n\n===Pelagianism and Judaism===\nOne of the most important distinctions between Christianity and [[Judaism]] is that the former conventionally teaches justice by faith, while the latter teaches that man has the choice to follow divine law. By teaching the absense of original sin and the idea that humans can choose between good and evil, Pelagianism advocated a position close to that of  Judaism.{{sfn|Fu|2015|p=182}} Pelagius wrote positively of Jews and Judaism, recommending that Christians study Old Testament law\u2014a sympathy not commonly encountered in Christianity after [[Paul the Apostle |Paul]].{{sfn|Visotzky|2009|p=48}} Augustine was the first to accuse Pelagianism of \"[[Judaizing]]\",{{sfn|Visotzky|2009|p=45}} which became a commonly heard criticism of it.{{sfn|Nelson|2019|p=51}}{{sfn|Visotzky|2009|p=45}} However, although contemporary rabbinic literature tends to take a Pelagian perspective on the major questions, and it could be argued that the rabbis shared a ''[[Weltanschauung]]'' with Pelagius, there were minority opinions within Judaism which argued for ideas more similar to Augustine's.{{sfn|Visotzky|2009|p=59}} Overall, Jewish discourse did not discuss free will and emphasized God's goodness in his revelation of the [[Torah]].{{sfn|Visotzky|2009|p=60}}\n\n==Later responses==\n[[Thomas Bradwardine]] (c. 1290\u20131349) wrote ''De causa Dei contra Pelagium et de virtute causarum ad suos Mertonenses'' condemning Pelagianism, as did [[Gabriel Biel]] in the 15th century.{{sfn|Reese|1996|p=421}} Johann Pupper, also known as [[Johannes von Goch]] (c. 1400\u20131475), an [[Augustinian]], recommended a return to the text of the Bible as a remedy for Pelagianism.{{sfn|Webster|1980|p=783|loc=Johannes von Goch}}\n\n===Early modern era===\nPelagianism became a common accusation during the [[Protestant Reformation]]; Reformers often used the epithet to critique what they saw as late-medieval Catholicism's undue emphasis on doing [[Justification (theology)|good works]]. [[Martin Luther]] (1483\u20131546), [[John Calvin]] (1509\u20131564), and [[Cornelius Jansen]] (1585\u20131638) reacted in different ways against Pelagianism, and evaluations of [[Lutheranism|Lutheran]], [[Calvinism|Reformed]], and [[Jansenism|Jansenist]] theologies have often turned on the question of what is or is not Pelagian.{{sfn|Cottret|Cottret| Michel|2002}}{{page needed|date=April 2020}}\n\nDuring the modern era, Pelagianism continued to be used as an epithet against orthodox Christians, but there were nevertheless some who had essentially Pelagian views according to Nelson's definition.{{sfn|Nelson|2019|p=4}} Nelson argued that many of those considered the predecessors to modern [[liberalism]] took Pelagian or Pelagian-adjanect positions on the problem of evil.{{sfn|Nelson|2019|p=5}} For instance, Leibniz who coined the word [[theodicy]] in 1710, rejected Pelagianism but nevertheless proved to be \"a crucial conduit for Pelagian ideas\".{{sfn|Nelson|2019|pp=2, 5}} He argued that \"Freedom is deemed necessary in order that man may be deemed guilty and open to punishment.\"{{sfn|Nelson|2019|p=8}} In ''[[De doctrina christiana (Milton)|De doctrina christiana]]'', [[John Milton]] argued that \"if, because of God\u2019s decree, man could not help but fall . . . then God\u2019s restoration of fallen man was a matter of justice not grace\".{{sfn|Nelson|2019|p=7}} Milton also argued for other positions that could be considered Pelagian, such as that \"The knowledge and survey of vice, is in this world . . . necessary to the constituting of human virtue.\"{{sfn|Nelson|2019|p=11}} [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]] made nearly identical arguments for that point.{{sfn|Nelson|2019|p=11}} [[John Locke]] argued that the idea  that \"all ''Adam''\u2019s Posterity [are] doomed to Eternal Infinite Punishment, for the Transgression of ''Adam''\" was \"little consistent with the Justice or Goodness of the Great and Infinite God\".{{sfn|Nelson|2019|pp=7\u20138}} He did not accept that original sin corrupted human nature, and argued that man could live a Christian life (although not \"void of slips and falls\") and be entitled to justification.{{sfn|Nelson|2019|p=8}}\n\nNelson argues that the drive for rational justification of religion, rather than a symptom of [[secularization]], was actually \"a Pelagian response to the theodicy problem\" because \"the conviction that everything\nnecessary for salvation must be accessible to human reason was yet another inference from God\u2019s justice\". In Pelagianism, libertarian free will is [[necessary but not sufficient]] for God's punishment of humans to be justified, because man must also understand God's commands.{{sfn|Nelson|2019|p=15}} As a result, thinkers such as Locke, Rousseau and [[Immanuel Kant]] argued that following [[natural law]] without [[revealed religion]] must be sufficient for the salvation of those who were never exposed to Christianity because, as Locke pointed out, access to revelation is a matter of [[moral luck]].{{sfn|Nelson|2019|pp=16\u201318}} Early modern proto-liberals such as Milton, Locke, Leibniz, and Rousseau advocated [[religious toleration]] and freedom of private action (eventually codified as [[human rights]]), as only freely chosen actions could merit salvation.{{sfn|Nelson|2019|pp=19\u201320}}{{efn|This is the opposite of the Augustinian argument against excessive state power, which is that human corruption is such that man cannot be trusted to wield it without creating tyranny, what [[Judith Shklar]] called \"liberalism of fear\".{{sfn|Nelson|2019|p=21}}}}\n\nNineteenth-century philosopher [[S\u00f8ren Kierkegaard]] dealt with the same problems (nature, grace, freedom, and sin) as Augustine and Pelagius,{{sfn|Puchniak |2008|p=124}} which he believed were opposites in a [[Hegelian dialectic]].{{sfn|Puchniak |2008|p=126}} He rarely mentioned Pelagius explicitly{{sfn|Puchniak |2008|p=124}} even though he inclined towards a Pelagian viewpoint. However, Kierkegaard rejected the idea that man could perfect himself.{{sfn|Puchniak |2008|p=128}}\n\n===Contemporary responses===\nIn the book ''Guardare Cristo: Esercizi di fede, speranza e carit\u00e0'' (Looking at Christ: Exercises of faith, hope and charity),{{sfn|Ratzinger|1989|p=}} [[Pope Benedict XVI]] wrote: {{quote|the other face of the same vice is the Pelagianism of the pious. They do not want forgiveness and in general they do not want any real gift from God either. They just want to be in order. They don\u2019t want hope they just want security. Their aim is to gain the right to salvation through a strict practice of religious exercises, through prayers and action. What they lack is humility which is essential in order to love; the humility to receive gifts not just because we deserve it or because of how we act&nbsp;...|source={{harvnb|Tornielli|2013}} }}\n\nIn a June 2013 talk with the leadership of the Religious Confederation of Latin America and the Caribbean (CLAR), [[Pope Francis]] alluded to Pelagian tendencies when he referred to \"restorationists\", one group of whom sent him after his election 3,525 rosaries. The pope said he was \"bothered\" by this need to count prayers and labeled it \"pelagianism.\" He went on to comment: \"these groups return to practices and disciplines I lived \u2013 not you, none of you are old \u2013 to things that were lived in that moment, but not now, they aren't today&nbsp;...\"<ref name=\"Winters2013\" /> The [[Congregation of the Doctrine of the Faith]] subsequently emphasised \"neo-Pelagianism\" in a letter of February 2018 titled ''Placuit Deo'', stating, \"A new form of Pelagianism is spreading in our days, one in which the individual, understood to be radically autonomous, presumes to save oneself, without recognizing that, at the deepest level of being, he or she derives from God and from others.\"<ref name=\"PlacuitDeo\" />\n\n[[John Rawls]] was a critic of Pelagianism, an attitude that he retained even after becoming an athiest. His anti-Pelagian ideas influenced his book ''[[A Theory of Justice]]'', in which he argued that differences in productivity between humans are a result of \"moral arbitrariness\" and therefore unequal wealth is undeserved.{{sfn|Nelson|2019|pp=50, 53}} According to Nelson, many contemporary [[social liberals]] follow Rawls rather than the older liberal-Pelagian tradition.{{sfn|Nelson|2019|p=49}}\n\n==References==\n===Notes===\n{{notelist}}\n===Citations===\n{{Reflist|20em|refs=\n\n<ref name=\"Knowles\">{{Cite web |title=Unitarian Universalists |last=Knowles |first=George |work=controverscial.com |date= |access-date=3 December 2019 |url= http://www.controverscial.com/Unitarian%20Universalists.htm |language= |quote=}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"Winters2013\">{{Cite web |title=Pope Francis on Pelagians, Gnostics and the CDF |last=Winters |first=Michael Sean |work=National Catholic Reporter |date=12 June 2013 |access-date=3 December 2019 |url= https://www.ncronline.org/blogs/distinctly-catholic/pope-francis-pelagians-gnostics-and-cdf |quote=}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"PlacuitDeo\">{{Cite web |title=Letter ''Placuit Deo'' to the Bishops of the Catholic Church on Certain Aspects of Christian Salvation |last1=Ladaria |first1=Luis F. |last2=Morandi |first2=Giacomo |work=vatican.va |date=22 February 2018 |access-date=3 December 2019 |url= https://www.vatican.va/roman_curia/congregations/cfaith/documents/rc_con_cfaith_doc_20180222_placuit-deo_en.html  }}</ref>\n}}\n\n===Sources===\n{{refbegin|2|indent=yes}}\n*{{cite book |last1=Bonner |first1=Ali |title=[[The Myth of Pelagianism]] |date=2018 |publisher=[[Oxford University Press]] |location=Oxford |isbn=978-0-19-726639-7 |language=English|series= \t[[British Academy Monograph]]}}\n*{{cite encyclopedia |first=Gerald |last = Bonner|authorlink=Gerald Bonner| publisher = Oxford University Press | encyclopedia= Oxford Dictionary of National Biography| title= Pelagius (fl. c.390\u2013418), theologian| year = 2004 | | doi= 10.1093/ref:odnb/21784 }}\n*{{cite book|last=Cohen|first=Samuel |chapter=Religious Diversity|editor1=Jonathan J.

This theological theory is named after the British monk [[Pelagius]] ({{circa|355}}&nbsp;\u2013 {{circa|420}} CE), although he denied, at least at some point in his life, many of the doctrines associated with his name. Pelagianism asserts human will, as created with its abilities by God, is sufficient to live a sinless life, although God's grace assists every good work. It has come to be identified with the view (whether taught by Pelagius or not) that human beings can earn salvation by their own efforts.\n\n==Pelagian controversy==\n[[File:Nuremberg chronicles f 135r 2.jpg|thumb|right|Pelagius Hereticus and [[John Chrysostom]] depicted in the ''[[Nuremberg Chronicle]]'', 1493]]\n\n[[Pelagius]] ({{circa|355}}\u2013{{circa|420}} CE){{sfn|Elliott|2011|p=377}} was a monk, probably from the [[British Isles]], who moved to [[Rome]] in the mid-380s.{{sfn|Keech|2012|p=38}} At the time, many Romans were converting to Christianity, but they did not necessarily follow the faith strictly.{{sfn|Kirwan|1998}} Pelagius criticized what he saw as an increasing laxity among Christians, instead promoting higher moral standards and [[Christian asceticism]].{{sfn|Elliott|2011|p=377}}{{sfn|Wetzel|2001|p=51}} He defended asceticism from the accusation of [[Manicheanism]] and argued for the possibility of a [[sinless |sinless life]]. The rejection of [[original sin]] was not original to Pelagius, initially promoted by [[Rufinus the Syrian]].{{sfn|Bonner|2004}} Pelagius and his ideas were most popular among circles of the Roman elite, who adopted [[lay asceticism]] as a way of life.{{sfn|Keech|2012|p=38}}{{sfn|Wetzel|2001|p=51}} Other prominent Pelagians included the former Roman aristocrat [[Caelestius]], described by [[Gerald Bonner]] as \"the real apostle of the so-called Pelagian movement\", and the apologist [[Julian of Eclanum]].{{sfn|Bonner|2004}} According to scholar [[Ali Bonner]], the ideas Pelagius actually promoted were not a \"new heresy\", as Augustine claimed, but mainstream in contemporary Christianity, advocated by such figures as [[Athanasius of Alexandria]] and [[Jerome]].<ref>{{cite news |last1=Bonner |first1=Ali |title=In praise of Pelagius |url=https://www.churchtimes.co.uk/articles/2018/31-august/features/features/in-praise-of-pelagius |accessdate=19 April 2020 |work=[[The Church Times]] |date=31 August 2018}}</ref> \n\nAugustine maintained friendly relations with Pelagius until at least 413, initially only condemning Caelestius' teachings.{{sfn|Bonner|2004}} In 415, the Gallic bishops [[Heros of Arles]] and [[Lazarus of Aix]] accused Pelagius of heresy; Pelagius defended himself by claiming not to teach what he was accused of and by ascribing some of the teachings to Caelestinus and disavowing them, leading to his acquittal at the Council of Diospolis in [[Lod]]. Following the verdict, Augustine led condemnation of Pelagius in Africa and persuaded Pope [[Innocent I]] to condemn Pelagianism. In January 417, shortly before his death, Innocent [[excommunicated]] Pelagius and two of his followers. Innocent's successor, [[Pope Zosimus|Zosimus]], initially agreed to reopen the case against Pelagius, but backtracked following pressure from the African bishops.{{sfn|Bonner|2004}}{{sfn|Keech|2012|pp=39\u201340}}  Pelagianism was later condemned at the [[Council of Carthage (418)]],{{sfn|Reese|1996|p=421}} after which Zosimus issued the ''Epistola tractoria'' excommunicating both Pelagius and Caelestinus.{{sfn|Bonner|2004}} The condemnation of Pelagianism was ratified at the [[First Council of Ephesus|Council of Ephesus]].{{sfn|Keech|2012|p=40}}\n\nAt the time, Pelagius' teachings had considerable support among Christians, especially other monks.{{sfn|Puchniak|2008|p=123}} The strict moral teachings of the Pelagians were influential in southern Italy, where they were openly preached until the death of Julian of Eclanum in 455; in Sicily, where the anonymous \"[[Sicilian Briton]]\" wrote.<ref name=\"Knowles\" />{{better source|date=April 2020}} Despite repeated attempts to suppress Pelagianism and similar teachings by [[Orthodoxy|orthodox]] clergy, some followers were still active in the [[Ostrogothic Kingdom]] (493\u2013553), most notably in [[Picenum]] and [[Dalmatia (Roman province)|Dalmatia]] during the rule of [[Theoderic the Great]].{{sfn|Cohen|2016|p=523}} Pelagianism was also reported to be popular in Britain, as [[Germanus of Auxerre]] had to make at least one visit (in 429) to denounce the heresy. Some scholars, including [[Nowell Myres]] and [[John Morris (historian) |John Morris]], have suggested that Pelagianism in Britain was understood as an attack on Roman decadence and corruption, but this has been criticized by others such as [[Wolf Liebeschuetz]].{{sfn|Bonner|2004}}\n\n==Beliefs==\n\nPelagius taught that humans were free of the burden of [[original sin]], because it would be unjust for any person to be blamed for another's actions.{{sfn|Puchniak|2008|p=123}} He believed that Adam's transgression had caused humans to become mortal, and given them a bad example, but not corrupted their nature.{{sfn|Visotzky|2009|p=49}}{{efn|Caelestinus went even further, arguing that Adam had been created mortal.{{sfn|Visotzky|2009|p=50}}}} Because humans retained [[libertarian free will|complete freedom of action]], making them fully responsible for all actions.{{sfn|Puchniak|2008|p=123}}  In other words, sin is not an inevitable result of [[human nature]], but instead comes about by [[free choice]].{{sfn|Visotzky|2009|p=44}} Because a person always has the ability to choose the right action in each circumstance, it is therefore theoretically possible (though rare) to live a sinless life.{{sfn|Puchniak|2008|p=123}}{{sfn|Kirwan|1998|loc=Pelagius}} Pelagius taught that a human's ability to act correctly is a gift of God,{{sfn|Kirwan|1998|loc=Pelagius}} as well as [[divine revelation]] and the example and teachings of Jesus. Further spiritual development, including faith in Christianity, was up to individual choice, not divine benevolence.{{sfn|Puchniak|2008|p=123}}{{sfn|Visotzky|2009|p=48}} Because sin must be deliberate and people are only responsible for their own actions, infants are without fault and [[infant baptism]] is unnecessary.{{sfn|Kirwan|1998|loc=Grace and free will}} \nThere is significant doubt as to what Pelagius actually taught,{{cn|date=April 2020}} and what Augustine called \"Pelagianism\" was more his own invention than that of Pelagius.{{sfn|Visotzky|2009|p=50}}{{sfn|Bonner|2018|p=302}} Later Christians used \"Pelagianism\" as an insult for theologically orthodox Christians who held positions that they disagreed with. Historian [[Eric Nelson (historian)|Eric Nelson]] defined genuine Pelagianism as rejection of original sin or denial of original sin's effect on man's ability to avoid sin.{{sfn|Nelson|2019|p=4}}\n===Comparison of Pelagianism and Augustinianism===\nPelagius' teachings on human nature, divine grace, and sin were opposed to those of Augustine, who declared Pelagius \"the enemy of the grace of God\".{{sfn|Puchniak|2008|p=123}} The Pelagians charged Augustine with departing from the accepted teaching (e.g.: [[John 8:11]]) of the Apostles and the Bible, demonstrating the doctrine of original sin amounted to [[Manichaeism]], which taught that the flesh was in itself sinful (and thus denied Jesus [[Incarnation (Christianity)|came in the flesh]]). This charge would have carried added weight since contemporaries knew Augustine had himself been a Manichaean layman before converting to Christianity.{{sfn|Stump|Kretzmann|2001|pp= 130\u2013135}} Pelagianism shaped Augustine's ideas in opposition to its own on free will, grace, and original sin.{{sfn|Visotzky|2009|p=43}}{{sfn|Keech|2012|p=15}} However, according to [[Peter Brown (historian)|Peter Brown]], \"For a sensitive man of the fifth century, Manichaeism, Pelagianism, and the views of Augustine were not as widely separated as we would now see them: they would have appeared to him as points along the great circle of problems raised by the Christian religion\".{{sfn|Visotzky|2009|p=53}}\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

The Augustinian defense of God's grace against accusations of arbitrariness is that God's ways are incomprehensible to mere mortals.{{sfn|Nelson|2019|p=4}} Yet, as later critics such as [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz]] asserted, asking \"[[Euthyphro dilemma|it is good and just because God wills it or whether God wills it because it is good and just]]?\", this defense (although accepted by many Catholic and [[Reformed]] theologians) creates a [[Divine command theory|God-centered morality]], which, in Leibniz' view \"would destroy the justice of God\" and make him into a tyrant.{{sfn|Nelson|2019|pp=5\u20136}}\n\n===Pelagianism and Judaism===\nOne of the most important distinctions between Christianity and [[Judaism]] is that the former conventionally teaches justice by faith, while the latter teaches that man has the choice to follow divine law. By teaching the absense of original sin and the idea that humans can choose between good and evil, Pelagianism advocated a position close to that of  Judaism.{{sfn|Fu|2015|p=182}} Pelagius wrote positively of Jews and Judaism, recommending that Christians study Old Testament law\u2014a sympathy not commonly encountered in Christianity after [[Paul the Apostle |Paul]].{{sfn|Visotzky|2009|p=48}} Augustine was the first to accuse Pelagianism of \"[[Judaizing]]\",{{sfn|Visotzky|2009|p=45}} which became a commonly heard criticism of it.{{sfn|Nelson|2019|p=51}}{{sfn|Visotzky|2009|p=45}} However, although contemporary rabbinic literature tends to take a Pelagian perspective on the major questions, and it could be argued that the rabbis shared a ''[[Weltanschauung]]'' with Pelagius, there were minority opinions within Judaism which argued for ideas more similar to Augustine's.{{sfn|Visotzky|2009|p=59}} Overall, Jewish discourse did not discuss free will and emphasized God's goodness in his revelation of the [[Torah]].{{sfn|Visotzky|2009|p=60}}\n\n==Later responses==\n[[Thomas Bradwardine]] (c. 1290\u20131349) wrote ''De causa Dei contra Pelagium et de virtute causarum ad suos Mertonenses'' condemning Pelagianism, as did [[Gabriel Biel]] in the 15th century.{{sfn|Reese|1996|p=421}} Johann Pupper, also known as [[Johannes von Goch]] (c. 1400\u20131475), an [[Augustinian]], recommended a return to the text of the Bible as a remedy for Pelagianism.{{sfn|Webster|1980|p=783|loc=Johannes von Goch}}\n\n===Early modern era===\nPelagianism became a common accusation during the [[Protestant Reformation]]; Reformers often used the epithet to critique what they saw as late-medieval Catholicism's undue emphasis on doing [[Justification (theology)|good works]]. [[Martin Luther]] (1483\u20131546), [[John Calvin]] (1509\u20131564), and [[Cornelius Jansen]] (1585\u20131638) reacted in different ways against Pelagianism, and evaluations of [[Lutheranism|Lutheran]], [[Calvinism|Reformed]], and [[Jansenism|Jansenist]] theologies have often turned on the question of what is or is not Pelagian.{{sfn|Cottret|Cottret| Michel|2002}}{{page needed|date=April 2020}}\n\nDuring the modern era, Pelagianism continued to be used as an epithet against orthodox Christians, but there were nevertheless some who had essentially Pelagian views according to Nelson's definition.{{sfn|Nelson|2019|p=4}} Nelson argued that many of those considered the predecessors to modern [[liberalism]] took Pelagian or Pelagian-adjanect positions on the problem of evil.{{sfn|Nelson|2019|p=5}} For instance, Leibniz who coined the word [[theodicy]] in 1710, rejected Pelagianism but nevertheless proved to be \"a crucial conduit for Pelagian ideas\".{{sfn|Nelson|2019|pp=2, 5}} He argued that \"Freedom is deemed necessary in order that man may be deemed guilty and open to punishment.\"{{sfn|Nelson|2019|p=8}} In ''[[De doctrina christiana (Milton)|De doctrina christiana]]'', [[John Milton]] argued that \"if, because of God\u2019s decree, man could not help but fall . . . then God\u2019s restoration of fallen man was a matter of justice not grace\".{{sfn|Nelson|2019|p=7}} Milton also argued for other positions that could be considered Pelagian, such as that \"The knowledge and survey of vice, is in this world . . . necessary to the constituting of human virtue.\"{{sfn|Nelson|2019|p=11}} [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]] made nearly identical arguments for that point.{{sfn|Nelson|2019|p=11}} [[John Locke]] argued that the idea  that \"all ''Adam''\u2019s Posterity [are] doomed to Eternal Infinite Punishment, for the Transgression of ''Adam''\" was \"little consistent with the Justice or Goodness of the Great and Infinite God\".{{sfn|Nelson|2019|pp=7\u20138}} He did not accept that original sin corrupted human nature, and argued that man could live a Christian life (although not \"void of slips and falls\") and be entitled to justification.{{sfn|Nelson|2019|p=8}}\n\nNelson argues that the drive for rational justification of religion, rather than a symptom of [[secularization]], was actually \"a Pelagian response to the theodicy problem\" because \"the conviction that everything\nnecessary for salvation must be accessible to human reason was yet another inference from God\u2019s justice\". In Pelagianism, libertarian free will is [[necessary but not sufficient]] for God's punishment of humans to be justified, because man must also understand God's commands.{{sfn|Nelson|2019|p=15}} As a result, thinkers such as Locke, Rousseau and [[Immanuel Kant]] argued that following [[natural law]] without [[revealed religion]] must be sufficient for the salvation of those who were never exposed to Christianity because, as Locke pointed out, access to revelation is a matter of [[moral luck]].{{sfn|Nelson|2019|pp=16\u201318}} Early modern proto-liberals such as Milton, Locke, Leibniz, and Rousseau advocated [[religious toleration]] and freedom of private action (eventually codified as [[human rights]]), as only freely chosen actions could merit salvation.{{sfn|Nelson|2019|pp=19\u201320}}{{efn|This is the opposite of the Augustinian argument against excessive state power, which is that human corruption is such that man cannot be trusted to wield it without creating tyranny, what [[Judith Shklar]] called \"liberalism of fear\".{{sfn|Nelson|2019|p=21}}}}\n\nNineteenth-century philosopher [[S\u00f8ren Kierkegaard]] dealt with the same problems (nature, grace, freedom, and sin) as Augustine and Pelagius,{{sfn|Puchniak |2008|p=124}} which he believed were opposites in a [[Hegelian dialectic]].{{sfn|Puchniak |2008|p=126}} He rarely mentioned Pelagius explicitly{{sfn|Puchniak |2008|p=124}} even though he inclined towards a Pelagian viewpoint. However, Kierkegaard rejected the idea that man could perfect himself.{{sfn|Puchniak |2008|p=128}}\n\n===Contemporary responses===\nIn the book ''Guardare Cristo: Esercizi di fede, speranza e carit\u00e0'' (Looking at Christ: Exercises of faith, hope and charity),{{sfn|Ratzinger|1989|p=}} [[Pope Benedict XVI]] wrote: {{quote|the other face of the same vice is the Pelagianism of the pious. They do not want forgiveness and in general they do not want any real gift from God either. They just want to be in order. They don\u2019t want hope they just want security. Their aim is to gain the right to salvation through a strict practice of religious exercises, through prayers and action.

In round five, both traded punches, but it was a left hook from Bellew that dropped Haye a third time. Haye managed to beat the count again, not long before Bellew started unloading a barrage of punches. With Haye against the ropes, referee Howard Foster stepped in at 2 minutes 14 seconds, giving Bellew his second stoppage win over Haye.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.boxingscene.com/tony-bellew-drops-david-haye-three-times-stops-him-results--127870|title=Tony Bellew Drops David Haye Three Times, Stops Him in Fifth|work=BoxingScene.com|access-date=2018-05-07|language=en-us}}</ref> Immediately after the fight Haye congratulated Bellew on the win.

The official time of the stoppage was at 2 minutes of round eight. There was very little action in round one as both boxers showed each other respect. Due to the lack of action, the crowd began to boo towards the end of the round. Overall, Usyk landed just three jabs and Bellew landed one power shot. Round two was similar, however Bellew stepped on the gas and landed some clean shots along with some showboating. Bellew took control in round three, landing two straight right hands. Usyk began using his jab more and after landing an overhand left, Bellew was left slightly shaken. By the end of round four, Bellew was backed up against the ropes and looked to tire. Bellew aimed most of his shots to Usyk's body and by round seven, was missing a lot of shots, mostly due to Usyk's foot movement, and ended the round with a bloodied nose. In round eight, whilst in a neutral corner, Usyk landed a hard left, again buzzing Bellew, forcing him to move away against the ropes. Another left hand wobbled Bellew before Usyk finished him off with another left which dropped Bellew backwards with his head landing on the bottom rope. A brave Bellew tried to get up slowly and beat the count but referee Terry O'Connor stopped the fight. Bellew's ten-fight winning streak came to an end. Judges Alejandro Cid and Steve Gray scored the first seven rounds 68\u201365 and 67\u201366 respectively in favour of Bellew, while Yury Koptsev had the fight 67\u201367.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.boxingscene.com/oleksandr-usyk-blasts-tony-bellew-knockout-results--133598|title=Oleksandr Usyk Blasts Tony Bellew For Knockout Win in Eight|work=BoxingScene.com|access-date=2018-11-22|language=en-us}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.skysports.com/boxing/news/12183/11551101/usyk-vs-bellew-tony-bellew-falls-short-in-attempt-to-dethrone-cruiserweight-king-oleksandr-usyk|title=Usyk vs Bellew: Tony Bellew falls short in attempt to dethrone cruiserweight king Oleksandr Usyk|work=Sky Sports|access-date=2018-11-22|language=en}}</ref>\n\nAfterwards, Bellew paid tribute to Usyk and announced his retirement from boxing, saying, \"I have been doing this for 20 years, and it is over.\" Usyk stated 2018 was the most difficult year of his career, but most successful. \"We need to put goals in front of us and move towards them,\" Usyk later stated.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/boxing/46167379|title=Oleksandr Usyk beats Tony Bellew to remain undisputed world cruiserweight champion|date=2018-11-11|work=BBC Sport|access-date=2018-11-22|language=en-GB}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.skysports.com/boxing/news/12183/11551110/usyk-vs-bellew-tony-bellew-labels-victorious-oleksandr-usyk-the-greatest-man-i-have-ever-shared-a-ring-with|title=Usyk vs Bellew: Tony Bellew labels victorious Oleksandr Usyk 'the greatest man I have ever shared a ring with'|work=Sky Sports|access-date=2018-11-22|language=en}}</ref> There was a small concern during Bellew's post-fight interview as many felt he was clearly concussed.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/av/boxing/46186822|title=Tony Bellew: Costello and Bunce debate if he should have been interviewed after Usyk defeat|date=2018-11-12|work=BBC Sport|access-date=2018-11-22|language=en-GB}}</ref> According to CompuBox stats, Usyk landed 112 of his 424 punches thrown (26%) and Bellew landed 61 of his 268 thrown (23%).

In round five, both traded punches, but it was a left hook from Bellew that dropped Haye a third time. Haye managed to beat the count again, not long before Bellew started unloading a barrage of punches. With Haye against the ropes, referee Howard Foster stepped in at 2 minutes 14 seconds, giving Bellew his second stoppage win over Haye.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.boxingscene.com/tony-bellew-drops-david-haye-three-times-stops-him-results--127870|title=Tony Bellew Drops David Haye Three Times, Stops Him in Fifth|work=BoxingScene.com|access-date=2018-05-07|language=en-us}}</ref> Immediately after the fight Haye congratulated Bellew on the win.

The official time of the stoppage was at 2 minutes of round eight. There was very little action in round one as both boxers showed each other respect. Due to the lack of action, the crowd began to boo towards the end of the round. Overall, Usyk landed just three jabs and Bellew landed one power shot. Round two was similar, however Bellew stepped on the gas and landed some clean shots along with some showboating. Bellew took control in round three, landing two straight right hands. Usyk began using his jab more and after landing an overhand left, Bellew was left slightly shaken. By the end of round four, Bellew was backed up against the ropes and looked to tire. Bellew aimed most of his shots to Usyk's body and by round seven, was missing a lot of shots, mostly due to Usyk's foot movement, and ended the round with a bloodied nose. In round eight, whilst in a neutral corner, Usyk landed a hard left, again buzzing Bellew, forcing him to move away against the ropes. Another left hand wobbled Bellew before Usyk finished him off with another left which dropped Bellew backwards with his head landing on the bottom rope. A brave Bellew tried to get up slowly and beat the count but referee Terry O'Connor stopped the fight. Bellew's ten-fight winning streak came to an end. Judges Alejandro Cid and Steve Gray scored the first seven rounds 68\u201365 and 67\u201366 respectively in favour of Bellew, while Yury Koptsev had the fight 67\u201367.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.boxingscene.com/oleksandr-usyk-blasts-tony-bellew-knockout-results--133598|title=Oleksandr Usyk Blasts Tony Bellew For Knockout Win in Eight|work=BoxingScene.com|access-date=2018-11-22|language=en-us}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.skysports.com/boxing/news/12183/11551101/usyk-vs-bellew-tony-bellew-falls-short-in-attempt-to-dethrone-cruiserweight-king-oleksandr-usyk|title=Usyk vs Bellew: Tony Bellew falls short in attempt to dethrone cruiserweight king Oleksandr Usyk|work=Sky Sports|access-date=2018-11-22|language=en}}</ref>\n\nAfterwards, Bellew paid tribute to Usyk and announced his retirement from boxing, saying, \"I have been doing this for 20 years, and it is over.\" Usyk stated 2018 was the most difficult year of his career, but most successful. \"We need to put goals in front of us and move towards them,\" Usyk later stated.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/boxing/46167379|title=Oleksandr Usyk beats Tony Bellew to remain undisputed world cruiserweight champion|date=2018-11-11|work=BBC Sport|access-date=2018-11-22|language=en-GB}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.skysports.com/boxing/news/12183/11551110/usyk-vs-bellew-tony-bellew-labels-victorious-oleksandr-usyk-the-greatest-man-i-have-ever-shared-a-ring-with|title=Usyk vs Bellew: Tony Bellew labels victorious Oleksandr Usyk 'the greatest man I have ever shared a ring with'|work=Sky Sports|access-date=2018-11-22|language=en}}</ref> There was a small concern during Bellew's post-fight interview as many felt he was clearly concussed.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/av/boxing/46186822|title=Tony Bellew: Costello and Bunce debate if he should have been interviewed after Usyk defeat|date=2018-11-12|work=BBC Sport|access-date=2018-11-22|language=en-GB}}</ref> According to CompuBox stats, Usyk landed 112 of his 424 punches thrown (26%) and Bellew landed 61 of his 268 thrown (23%).

On 1 January 1976, the 9th Brigade became the 9th Marine Infantry Division (9{{sup|e}} division d'Infanterie de Marine, 9{{sup|e}} DIMa), attached to the land intervention force, then the [[Rapid Action Force (FAR)|Rapid Action Force]] from 1984. On 1 July 1999, the 9th Marine Infantry Division became the 9th Marine Light Armoured Brigade. On 1 January 2013, the unit was renamed and downsized to the 9th Marine Infantry Brigade ({{lang-fr|9{{sup|e}} Brigade d'Infanterie de Marine, 9{{sup|e}} BIMa}}).\n\n== Creation and different nominations ==\n\n* 1943 - 1947 : creation of the 9th Colonial Infantry Division ({{lang-fr|[[:fr:9e division d'infanterie coloniale|9e Division d'Infanterie Coloniale]], 9<sup>e</sup> D.I.C }})\n* 1963 - 1976 : designated as 9th Brigade ({{lang-fr|9<sup>e</sup> Brigade, 9<sup>e</sup>B }})\n* 1976 - 1999 : designated as 9th Marine Infantry Division ({{lang-fr|9<sup>e</sup> Division d'Infanterie de Marine, 9<sup>e</sup> D.I.Ma }})\n* 1999 - 2013 : designated as 9th Light Armoured Marine Brigade ({{lang-fr|9<sup>e</sup> Brigade L\u00e9g\u00e8re Blind\u00e9e de Marine, 9<sup>e</sup> B.L.B.Ma }})\n* 2013\u2013present : designated as '''9th Marine Infantry Brigade''' ({{lang-fr|9<sup>e</sup> Brigade d'Infanterie de Marine, 9<sup>e</sup> B.I.Ma }})\n\n== History ==\n[[File:9th Colonial Division landing Elba 16 June 1944.jpg|thumb|right|Landing French 9th Colonial Infantry Division troops during the invasion of Elba. 16 June 1944.]]\nThe division is heir to the [[Blue Division (Second French Empire)|Blue Division]] which fought during the Franco-Prussian War of 1870, in particular during the [[Battle of Bazeilles]] and the 9th Colonial Infantry Division, part of the [[Free French Forces]], which distinguished themselves in the apprehending of [[Elba]] in June 1944 and the [[Operation Dragoon|disembarking in Provence]] on 15 August of the same year. The Division then made way to [[Indochina]], where it was placed dormant (without being dissolved) in December 1947. The unit was reactivated in July 1963 in [[Brittany]] under the designation of 9th Brigade. On 1 January 1976, the division was baptized as 9th Marine Infantry Division 9<sup>e</sup> DIMa. Accordingly, the division was attached to the terrestrial intervention force, then the [[Rapid Action Force (France)|Rapid Action Force]] (FAR) since 1983. On 1 July 1999, the unit was restructured in a brigade and was designated as 9th Light Armoured Marine Brigade (BLBMa). On 1 January 2013, the brigade was named to the current designation as the '''9th Marine Infantry Brigade''' (9<sup>e</sup> BIMa).\n\nThe headquarter staff is stationed in [[Poitiers]] since 1 July 2010. The motto of the brigade is \u00ab Semper et Ulbique \u00bb, [[Latin]] for \u00ab Always and All over \u00bb.\n\nThe \u00ab 9th \u00bb illustrated capability on all exterior theatres of operations where [[France]] has been engaged since [[World War II]]: [[Indochina War|Indochina]], [[Lebanese Civil War|Lebanon]], [[Gulf War|Kuwait]], Macedonia, [[Kosovo]], [[Bosnian War|Bosnia]], [[Republic of Congo|Congo]], [[Tchad]], [[Ivory Coast]]. From October 2010 to May 2011, the Brigade armed essentially [[Brigade La Fayette]] in [[Afghanistan]] by projecting a headquarter staff ( composed 50% of Marines, Bigors, Marine sapeurs of the 9<sup>e</sup> BIMa) and the tactical interam groupment of Richelieu armed by the [[2nd Marine Infantry Regiment]] 2<sup>e</sup> RIMa. On January 2013, elements of the Brigade took part in [[Operation Serval]].\n\nIn all [[combat]] engagement theatres around the globe, the 9<sup>e</sup> BIMa illustrated worth of the oldest traditions of the [[Troupes de Marine|French Troop de Marine]].\n\n== Missions ==\n\nThe principal mission of the 9<sup>e</sup> BIMa, for which the brigade is apt to revolve around:\n\n* Amphibious actions: quick projection of a headquarter staff and one reinforced battalion (1,400 men) by naval amphibious [[French Navy|marine]] means, such as [[Mistral-class amphibious assault ship]].\n* Security missions, securitization of urbain oriented combat designated areas.\n* Deep decentralization action of search and reconnaissance oriented missions.\n* Rapid and deep incursions (armored raids, 100&nbsp;km range)\n\nThe 9<sup>e</sup> BIMa is present around the globe and also relieves missions of short duration such as in [[Senegal]], [[Guyana]] in Mayotte and [[Djibouti]]. The 9<sup>e</sup>BIMa actively participates to missions with the [[French Navy]] as the land terrestrial land component of Amphibious groups.\n\nThe 9<sup>e</sup> BIMa is twinned with [[Royal Marines|3rd Royal Marines Commando Brigade]] of the [[Royal Navy]]. Within this title, from 28 May to 1 June 2012, the center of amphibious operations of the headquarter staff embarked on [[Mistral (L9013)|BPC Mistral]] with the designated exercise Narval. 10 officers of the headquarter staff of the (twin brigade) participated in light of preparation to exercise Corsican Lion which took place from 17 October to 26 October 2012.\n\n== Organization 2016 ==\n\n[[File:9th Marine Brigade.png|thumb|9th Marine Infantry Brigade]]\n\n* 9{{sup|e}} Compagnie de Commandement et de Transmissions (9{{sup|e}} CCT) - Command and Signals Company in [[Poitiers]] with VAB\n* [[R\u00e9giment d'infanterie-chars de marine|R\u00e9giment d'Infanterie-Chars de Marine]] (RICM) - Armoured Marine Infantry Regiment (light cavalry) in [[Poitiers]] with [[AMX 10 RC]] and [[ERC 90 Sagaie|ERC 90]]\n* [[1st Marine Infantry Regiment|1{{sup|er}} R\u00e9giment d'Infanterie de Marine]] (1{{sup|er}} RIMa) - Armoured Marine Infantry Regiment (light cavalry) in [[Angoul\u00eame]] with [[AMX 10 RC]] and [[ERC 90 Sagaie|ERC 90]]\n* [[2nd Marine Infantry Regiment|2{{sup|e}} R\u00e9giment d'Infanterie de Marine]] (2{{sup|e}} RIMa) - Marine Infantry Regiment in [[Le Mans]] with [[V\u00e9hicule blind\u00e9 de combat d'infanterie|VBCI]]\n* [[3rd Marine Infantry Regiment|3{{sup|e}} R\u00e9giment d'Infanterie de Marine]] (3{{sup|e}} RIMa) - Marine Infantry Regiment in [[Vannes]] with [[V\u00e9hicule de l'Avant Blind\u00e9|VAB]]\n* [[126th Infantry Regiment (France)|126{{sup|e}} R\u00e9giment d'Infanterie]] (126{{sup|e}} RI) - Infantry Regiment in [[Brive-la-Gaillarde]] with VAB (will be the first unit to receive the new [[VBMR Griffon]] in 2018)\n* [[11th Marine Artillery Regiment|11{{sup|e}} R\u00e9giment d'Artillerie de Marine]] (11{{sup|e}} RAMa) - Marine Artillery Regiment in [[Saint-Aubin-du-Cormier]]  with [[TRF1]] howitzers, [[CAESAR self-propelled howitzer|CAESAR]] self-propelled howitzers and [[Mortier 120mm Ray\u00e9 Tract\u00e9 Mod\u00e8le F1|RTF1]] mortars\n* [[6th Engineer Regiment|6{{sup|e}} R\u00e9giment du G\u00e9nie]] (6{{sup|e}} RG) - Engineer Regiment in [[Angers]]\n\n== Fanfare band ==\nThe brigade maintains a voluntary [[military band]] placed under the authority of the commanding general of the 9eBIMa.
