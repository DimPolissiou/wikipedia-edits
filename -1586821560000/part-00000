Similar developments occurred in other states. Both of the industrially large states cooperated with the Commonwealth in the development and interconnection of the [[Snowy Mountains Scheme]].\n\nRapid economic growth led to large and expanding construction programs of coal-fired power stations such as black coal in New South Wales and brown coal in Victoria. By the 1980s complex policy questions had emerged involving the massive requirements for investment, land and water.\n\nBetween 1981 and 1983 a cascade of blackouts and disruptions was triggered in both states, resulting from generator design failures in New South Wales, industrial disputes in Victoria, and drought in the storages of the Snowy system (which provided essential [[peaking power plant|peak power]] to the State systems). Wide political controversy arose from this and from proposals to the New South Wales Government from the [[Electricity Commission of New South Wales]] for urgent approval to build large new stations at Mardi and Olney on the Central Coast, and at other sites later.\n\nThe Commission of Enquiry into Electricity Generation Planning in New South Wales was established, reporting in mid-1985. This was the first independent enquiry directed from outside the industry into the Australian electricity system. It found, among other matters, that existing power stations were very inefficient, that plans for four new stations, worth then about $12 billion, should be abandoned, and that if the sector were restructured there should be sufficient capacity for normal purposes until the early years of the 21st century. This forecast was achieved. The Commission also recommended enhanced operational coordination of the adjoining State systems and the interconnection in eastern Australia of regional power markets.<ref>[http://catalogue.nla.gov.au/Record/1842169?lookfor=nsw%20electricity%20generation%20planning&offset=2&max=405134 Reports of the Commission of Enquiry into Electricity Generation Planning in NSW], 4 vols, Sydney 1985.</ref>\n\nThe New South Wales Enquiry marked the beginning of the end of the centralised power utility monopolies and established the direction of a new trajectory in Australian energy policy, towards decentralisation, interconnection of States and the use of markets for coordination. Similar enquiries were subsequently established in Victoria (by the Parliament) and elsewhere, and during the 1990s the industry was comprehensively restructured in southeastern Australia and subsequently corporatised.\n\nFollowing the report by the Industry Commission on the sector<ref>Industry Commission, ''Energy Generation and Distribution'', 2 volumes, Canberra, 1991</ref> moves towards a national market developed.

Similar developments occurred in other states. Both of the industrially large states cooperated with the Commonwealth in the development and interconnection of the [[Snowy Mountains Scheme]].\n\nRapid economic growth led to large and expanding construction programs of coal-fired power stations such as black coal in New South Wales and brown coal in Victoria. By the 1980s complex policy questions had emerged involving the massive requirements for investment, land and water.\n\nBetween 1981 and 1983 a cascade of blackouts and disruptions was triggered in both states, resulting from generator design failures in New South Wales, industrial disputes in Victoria, and drought in the storages of the Snowy system (which provided essential [[peaking power plant|peak power]] to the State systems). Wide political controversy arose from this and from proposals to the New South Wales Government from the [[Electricity Commission of New South Wales]] for urgent approval to build large new stations at Mardi and Olney on the Central Coast, and at other sites later.\n\nThe Commission of Enquiry into Electricity Generation Planning in New South Wales was established, reporting in mid-1985. This was the first independent enquiry directed from outside the industry into the Australian electricity system. It found, among other matters, that existing power stations were very inefficient, that plans for four new stations, worth then about $12 billion, should be abandoned, and that if the sector were restructured there should be sufficient capacity for normal purposes until the early years of the 21st century. This forecast was achieved. The Commission also recommended enhanced operational coordination of the adjoining State systems and the interconnection in eastern Australia of regional power markets.<ref>[http://catalogue.nla.gov.au/Record/1842169?lookfor=nsw%20electricity%20generation%20planning&offset=2&max=405134 Reports of the Commission of Enquiry into Electricity Generation Planning in NSW], 4 vols, Sydney 1985.</ref>\n\nThe New South Wales Enquiry marked the beginning of the end of the centralised power utility monopolies and established the direction of a new trajectory in Australian energy policy, towards decentralisation, interconnection of States and the use of markets for coordination. Similar enquiries were subsequently established in Victoria (by the Parliament) and elsewhere, and during the 1990s the industry was comprehensively restructured in southeastern Australia and subsequently corporatised.\n\nFollowing the report by the Industry Commission on the sector<ref>Industry Commission, ''Energy Generation and Distribution'', 2 volumes, Canberra, 1991</ref> moves towards a national market developed.

For example, species richness (usually noted {{math|''S''}}) of a dataset is the number of different species in the corresponding species list. Richness is a simple measure, so it has been a popular diversity index in ecology, where abundance data are often not available for the datasets of interest. Because richness does not take the abundances of the types into account, it is not the same thing as diversity, which does take abundances into account. However, if true diversity is calculated with {{math|''q'' {{=}} 0}} {{clarify |date=July 2019 |reason= What q is has never been defined}}, the effective number of types ({{math|<sup>0</sup>''D''}}) equals the actual number of types ({{math|''R''}}).<ref name=Jost2006 /><ref name=Tuomisto2010c />\n\n=={{anchor|Shannon index}}Shannon index==\nThe Shannon index has been a popular diversity index in the ecological literature, where it is also known as Shannon's diversity index, the Shannon\u2013[[Norbert Wiener|Wiener]] index, the Shannon\u2013[[Warren Weaver|Weaver]] index and the Shannon entropy.<ref name=Spellerberg2003>Spellerberg, Ian F., and Peter J. Fedor. (2003) A tribute to Claude Shannon (1916\u20132001) and a plea for more rigorous use of species richness, species diversity and the \u2018Shannon\u2013Wiener\u2019Index. Global ecology and biogeography 12.3, 177-179.</ref> The measure was originally proposed by [[Claude Shannon]] to quantify the [[Entropy (information theory)|entropy]] (uncertainty or information content) in strings of text.<ref name=Shannon1948>Shannon, C. E. (1948) [[A mathematical theory of communication]].  The Bell System Technical Journal, 27, 379\u2013423 and 623\u2013656.</ref> The idea is that the more different letters there are, and the more equal their proportional abundances in the string of interest, the more difficult it is to correctly predict which letter will be the next one in the string. The Shannon entropy quantifies the uncertainty (entropy or degree of surprise) associated with this prediction. It is most often calculated as follows:\n\n:<math> H' = -\\sum_{i=1}^R p_i \\ln p_i </math>\n\nwhere {{math|''p''<sub>''i''</sub>}} is the proportion of characters belonging to the {{math|''i''}}th type of letter in the string of interest. In ecology, {{math|''p''<sub>''i''</sub>}} is often the proportion of individuals belonging to the {{math|''i''}}th species in the dataset of interest. Then the Shannon entropy quantifies the uncertainty in predicting the species identity of an individual that is taken at random from the dataset.\n\nAlthough the equation is here written with natural logarithms, the base of the logarithm used when calculating the Shannon entropy can be chosen freely. Shannon himself discussed logarithm bases 2, 10 and {{math|''e''}}, and these have since become the most popular bases in applications that use the Shannon entropy. Each log base corresponds to a different measurement unit, which have been called binary digits (bits), decimal digits (decits) and natural digits (nats) for the bases 2, 10 and {{math|''e''}}, respectively. Comparing Shannon entropy values that were originally calculated with different log bases requires converting them to the same log base: change from the base {{math|''a''}} to base {{math|''b''}} is obtained with multiplication by {{math|log<sub>''b''</sub>''a''}}.<ref name=Shannon1948 />\n\nIt has been shown that the Shannon index is based on the [[weighted geometric mean]] of the proportional abundances of the types, and that it equals the logarithm of true diversity as calculated with {{math|''q'' {{=}} 1}}:<ref name=Tuomisto2010a />\n\n:<math> H' = -\\sum_{i=1}^R p_i \\ln p_i = -\\sum_{i=1}^R \\ln p_i^{p_i}</math>\n\nThis can also be written\n\n:<math> H' = -(\\ln p_1^{p_1} +\\ln p_2^{p_2} +\\ln p_3^{p_3} + \\cdots + \\ln p_R^{p_R}) </math>\n\nwhich equals\n\n:<math> H' = -\\ln p_1^{p_1}p_2^{p_2}p_3^{p_3} \\cdots p_R^{p_R} = \\ln \\left ( {1 \\over p_1^{p_1}p_2^{p_2}p_3^{p_3} \\cdots p_R^{p_R}} \\right ) = \\ln \\left ( {1 \\over {\\prod_{i=1}^R p_i^{p_i}}} \\right )</math>\n\nSince the sum of the {{math|''p''<sub>''i''</sub>}} values equals unity by definition, the denominator equals the weighted geometric mean of the {{math|''p''<sub>''i''</sub>}} values, with the {{math|''p''<sub>''i''</sub>}} values themselves being used as the weights (exponents in the equation).

The more unequal the abundances of the types, the larger the weighted geometric mean of the {{math|''p''<sub>''i''</sub>}} values, and the smaller the corresponding Shannon entropy. If practically all abundance is concentrated to one type, and the other types are very rare (even if there are many of them), Shannon entropy approaches zero. When there is only one type in the dataset, Shannon entropy exactly equals zero (there is no uncertainty in predicting the type of the next randomly chosen entity).\n\n===R\u00e9nyi entropy===\nThe [[R\u00e9nyi entropy]] is a generalization of the Shannon entropy to other values of {{math|''q''}} than unity.

The original Simpson's index hence equals the corresponding basic sum.<ref name=Jost2006 />\n\nThe interpretation of \u03bb as the probability that two entities taken at random from the dataset of interest represent the same type assumes that the first entity is replaced to the dataset before taking the second entity. If the dataset is very large, sampling without replacement gives approximately the same result, but in small datasets the difference can be substantial. If the dataset is small, and sampling without replacement is assumed, the probability of obtaining the same type with both random draws is:\n\n:<math> \\ell = \\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^R n_i (n_i -1)}{N (N-1)} </math>\n\nwhere {{math|''n''<sub>''i''</sub>}} is the number of entities belonging to the {{math|''i''}}th type and {{math|''N''}} is the total number of entities in the dataset.<ref name=Simpson1949 /> This form of the Simpson index is also known as the Hunter\u2013Gaston index in microbiology.<ref name=Hunter1988>{{cite journal|last1=Hunter|first1=PR|last2=Gaston|first2=MA|year=1988|title=Numerical index of the discriminatory ability of typing systems: an application of Simpson's index of diversity|volume=26|issue=11|pages=2465\u20132466|pmid=3069867|journal=J Clin Microbiol|pmc=266921}}</ref>\n\nSince mean proportional abundance of the types increases with decreasing number of types and increasing abundance of the most abundant type, \u03bb obtains small values in datasets of high diversity and large values in datasets of low diversity. This is counterintuitive behavior for a diversity index, so often such transformations of \u03bb that increase with increasing diversity have been used instead. The most popular of such indices have been the inverse Simpson index (1/\u03bb) and the Gini\u2013Simpson index (1&nbsp;\u2212&nbsp;\u03bb).<ref name=Hill1973 /><ref name=Jost2006 /> Both of these have also been called the Simpson index in the ecological literature, so care is needed to avoid accidentally comparing the different indices as if they were the same.\n\n===Inverse Simpson index===\nThe inverse Simpson index equals:\n\n:<math> \\frac{1}{ \\lambda } = {1 \\over\\sum_{i=1}^R p_i^2} = {}^2D</math>\n\nThis simply equals true diversity of order 2, i.e. the effective number of types that is obtained when the weighted arithmetic mean is used to quantify average proportional abundance of types in the dataset of interest.\n\nThe index is also as a measure of the [[effective number of parties]].\n\n===Gini\u2013Simpson index===\nThe original Simpson index \u03bb equals the probability that two entities taken at random from the dataset of interest (with replacement) represent the same type.

The entities of interest are usually individual plants or animals, and the measure of abundance can be, for example, number of individuals, biomass or coverage. In [[demography]], the entities of interest can be people, and the types of interest various demographic groups. In [[information science]], the entities can be characters and the types the different letters of the alphabet. The most commonly used diversity indices are simple transformations of the effective number of types (also known as 'true diversity'), but each diversity index can also be interpreted in its own right as a measure corresponding to some real phenomenon (but a different one for each diversity index).<ref name=\"Hill1973\">{{cite journal | last1 = Hill | first1 = M.

Such indices however do not account for the total variation (diversity) that can be held between subjects or entities which occurs only when both categorical and qualitative diversity are calculated.\n\nTrue diversity, or the effective number of types, refers to the number of equally abundant types needed for the average proportional abundance of the types to equal that observed in the dataset of interest (where all types may not be equally abundant). The true diversity in a dataset is calculated by first taking the weighted [[generalized mean]] {{math|''M''<sub>''q''\u22121</sub>}} of the proportional abundances of the types in the dataset, and then taking the [[Multiplicative inverse|reciprocal]] of this. The equation is:<ref name=\"Tuomisto2010a\" /><ref name=\"Tuomisto2010c\" />\n\n:<math>{}^q\\!D={1 \\over M_{q-1}}={1 \\over \\sqrt[q-1]{{\\sum_{i=1}^R p_i p_i^{q-1}}}}=\\left ( {\\sum_{i=1}^R p_i^q} \\right )^{1/(1-q)}</math>\n\nThe [[Fraction (mathematics)|denominator]] {{math|''M''<sub>''q''\u22121</sub>}} equals the average proportional abundance of the types in the dataset as calculated with the weighted [[generalized mean]] with exponent {{math|''q''-1}}. In the equation, {{math|''R''}} is richness (the total number of types in the dataset), and the proportional abundance of the {{math|''i''}}th type is {{math|''p''<sub>''i''</sub>}}. The proportional abundances themselves are used as the nominal weights. The numbers <math>^q D</math> are called '''Hill numbers of order q''' or '''effective number of species'''.<ref>{{Citation|last=Chao|first=Anne|title=Phylogenetic Diversity Measures and Their Decomposition: A Framework Based on Hill Numbers|date=2016|work=Biodiversity Conservation and Phylogenetic Systematics|pages=141\u2013172|publisher=Springer International Publishing|isbn=9783319224602|last2=Chiu|first2=Chun-Huo|last3=Jost|first3=Lou|doi=10.1007/978-3-319-22461-9_8|doi-access=free}}</ref>\n\nWhen {{math|''q'' {{=}} 1}}, the above equation is undefined.  However, the [[Limit (mathematics)|mathematical limit]] as {{math|''q''}} approaches 1 is well defined and the corresponding diversity is calculated with the following equation:\n\n:<math>{}^1\\!D={1 \\over {\\prod_{i=1}^R p_i^{p_i}}} = \\exp\\left(-\\sum_{i=1}^R p_i \\ln(p_i)\\right)</math>\n\nwhich is the exponential of the [[Shannon entropy]] calculated with natural logarithms (see above).  In other domains, this statistic is also known as the ''[[perplexity]]''.\n\nThe value of {{math|''q''}} is often referred to as the order of the diversity. It defines the sensitivity of the diversity value to rare vs. abundant species by modifying how the weighted mean of the species proportional abundances is calculated. With some values of the parameter {{math|''q''}}, the value of {{math|''M''<sub>''q''\u22121</sub>}} assumes familiar kinds of weighted mean as special cases. In particular, {{math|''q'' {{=}} 0}} corresponds to the weighted [[harmonic mean]], {{math|''q'' {{=}} 1}} to the weighted [[geometric mean]] and {{math|''q'' {{=}} 2}} to the weighted [[arithmetic mean]]. As {{math|''q''}} approaches [[infinity]], the weighted generalized mean with exponent {{math|''q''\u22121}} approaches the maximum {{math|''p''<sub>''i''</sub>}} value, which is the proportional abundance of the most abundant species in the dataset. Generally, increasing the value of {{math|''q''}} increases the effective weight given to the most abundant species. This leads to obtaining a larger {{math|''M''<sub>''q''\u22121</sub>}} value and a smaller true diversity ({{math|''<sup>q</sup>D''}}) value with increasing {{math|''q''}}.\n\nWhen {{math|''q'' {{=}} 1}}, the weighted geometric mean of the {{math|''p''<sub>''i''</sub>}} values is used, and each species is exactly weighted by its proportional abundance (in the weighted geometric mean, the weights are the exponents). When {{math|''q'' > 1}}, the weight given to abundant species is exaggerated, and when {{math|''q'' < 1}}, the weight given to rare species is. At {{math|''q'' {{=}} 0}}, the species weights exactly cancel out the species proportional abundances, such that the weighted mean of the {{math|''p''<sub>''i''</sub>}} values equals {{math|1 / ''R''}} even when all species are not equally abundant. At {{math|''q'' {{=}} 0}}, the effective number of species, {{math|<sup>0</sup>''D''}}, hence equals the actual number of species {{math|''R''}}. In the context of diversity, {{math|''q''}} is generally limited to non-negative values. This is because negative values of {{math|''q''}} would give rare species so much more weight than abundant ones that {{math|<sup>''q''</sup>''D''}} would exceed {{math|''R''}}.<ref name=\"Tuomisto2010a\" /><ref name=\"Tuomisto2010c\" />\n\nThe general equation of diversity is often written in the form<ref name=\"Hill1973\" /><ref name=\"Jost2006\" />\n\n:<math>{}^q\\!D=\\left ( {\\sum_{i=1}^R p_i^q} \\right )^{1/(1-q)}</math>\n\nand the term inside the parentheses is called the basic sum.

The Shannon entropy quantifies the uncertainty (entropy or degree of surprise) associated with this prediction. It is most often calculated as follows:\n\n:<math> H' = -\\sum_{i=1}^R p_i \\ln p_i </math>\n\nwhere {{math|''p''<sub>''i''</sub>}} is the proportion of characters belonging to the {{math|''i''}}th type of letter in the string of interest. In ecology, {{math|''p''<sub>''i''</sub>}} is often the proportion of individuals belonging to the {{math|''i''}}th species in the dataset of interest. Then the Shannon entropy quantifies the uncertainty in predicting the species identity of an individual that is taken at random from the dataset.\n\nAlthough the equation is here written with natural logarithms, the base of the logarithm used when calculating the Shannon entropy can be chosen freely. Shannon himself discussed logarithm bases 2, 10 and {{math|''e''}}, and these have since become the most popular bases in applications that use the Shannon entropy. Each log base corresponds to a different measurement unit, which have been called binary digits (bits), decimal digits (decits) and natural digits (nats) for the bases 2, 10 and {{math|''e''}}, respectively. Comparing Shannon entropy values that were originally calculated with different log bases requires converting them to the same log base: change from the base {{math|''a''}} to base {{math|''b''}} is obtained with multiplication by {{math|log<sub>''b''</sub>''a''}}.<ref name=Shannon1948 />\n\nIt has been shown that the Shannon index is based on the [[weighted geometric mean]] of the proportional abundances of the types, and that it equals the logarithm of true diversity as calculated with {{math|''q'' {{=}} 1}}:<ref name=Tuomisto2010a />\n\n:<math> H' = -\\sum_{i=1}^R p_i \\ln p_i = -\\sum_{i=1}^R \\ln p_i^{p_i}</math>\n\nThis can also be written\n\n:<math> H' = -(\\ln p_1^{p_1} +\\ln p_2^{p_2} +\\ln p_3^{p_3} + \\cdots + \\ln p_R^{p_R}) </math>\n\nwhich equals\n\n:<math> H' = -\\ln p_1^{p_1}p_2^{p_2}p_3^{p_3} \\cdots p_R^{p_R} = \\ln \\left ( {1 \\over p_1^{p_1}p_2^{p_2}p_3^{p_3} \\cdots p_R^{p_R}} \\right ) = \\ln \\left ( {1 \\over {\\prod_{i=1}^R p_i^{p_i}}} \\right )</math>\n\nSince the sum of the {{math|''p''<sub>''i''</sub>}} values equals unity by definition, the denominator equals the weighted geometric mean of the {{math|''p''<sub>''i''</sub>}} values, with the {{math|''p''<sub>''i''</sub>}} values themselves being used as the weights (exponents in the equation).

If practically all abundance is concentrated to one type, and the other types are very rare (even if there are many of them), Shannon entropy approaches zero.

Unpublished doctoral dissertation, Columbia University.</ref> The square root of the index had already been introduced in 1945 by the economist [[Albert O. Hirschman]].<ref>Hirschman, A. O. (1945) National power and the structure of foreign trade. Berkeley.</ref> As a result, the same measure is usually known as the Simpson index in ecology, and as the [[Herfindahl index]] or the Herfindahl\u2013Hirschman index (HHI) in economics.\n\nThe measure equals the probability that two entities taken at random from the dataset of interest represent the same type.<ref name=Simpson1949 /> It equals:\n\n:<math> \\lambda = \\sum_{i=1}^R p_i^2</math>,\n\nwhere {{math|''R''}} is richness (the total number of types in the dataset). This equation is also equal to the weighted arithmetic mean of the proportional abundances {{math|''p''<sub>''i''</sub>}} of the types of interest, with the proportional abundances themselves being used as the weights.<ref name=Hill1973 /> Proportional abundances are by definition constrained to values between zero and unity, but it is a weighted arithmetic mean, hence {{math|''\u03bb'' \u2265 1/''R''}}, which is reached when all types are equally abundant.\n\nBy comparing the equation used to calculate \u03bb with the equations used to calculate true diversity, it can be seen that {{math|1/\u03bb}} equals {{math|<sup>2</sup>''D''}}, i.e. true diversity as calculated with {{math|''q'' {{=}} 2}}. The original Simpson's index hence equals the corresponding basic sum.<ref name=Jost2006 />\n\nThe interpretation of \u03bb as the probability that two entities taken at random from the dataset of interest represent the same type assumes that the first entity is replaced to the dataset before taking the second entity. If the dataset is very large, sampling without replacement gives approximately the same result, but in small datasets the difference can be substantial. If the dataset is small, and sampling without replacement is assumed, the probability of obtaining the same type with both random draws is:\n\n:<math> \\ell = \\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^R n_i (n_i -1)}{N (N-1)} </math>\n\nwhere {{math|''n''<sub>''i''</sub>}} is the number of entities belonging to the {{math|''i''}}th type and {{math|''N''}} is the total number of entities in the dataset.<ref name=Simpson1949 /> This form of the Simpson index is also known as the Hunter\u2013Gaston index in microbiology.<ref name=Hunter1988>{{cite journal|last1=Hunter|first1=PR|last2=Gaston|first2=MA|year=1988|title=Numerical index of the discriminatory ability of typing systems: an application of Simpson's index of diversity|volume=26|issue=11|pages=2465\u20132466|pmid=3069867|journal=J Clin Microbiol|pmc=266921}}</ref>\n\nSince mean proportional abundance of the types increases with decreasing number of types and increasing abundance of the most abundant type, \u03bb obtains small values in datasets of high diversity and large values in datasets of low diversity. This is counterintuitive behavior for a diversity index, so often such transformations of \u03bb that increase with increasing diversity have been used instead. The most popular of such indices have been the inverse Simpson index (1/\u03bb) and the Gini\u2013Simpson index (1&nbsp;\u2212&nbsp;\u03bb).<ref name=Hill1973 /><ref name=Jost2006 /> Both of these have also been called the Simpson index in the ecological literature, so care is needed to avoid accidentally comparing the different indices as if they were the same.\n\n===Inverse Simpson index===\nThe inverse Simpson index equals:\n\n:<math> \\frac{1}{ \\lambda } = {1 \\over\\sum_{i=1}^R p_i^2} = {}^2D</math>\n\nThis simply equals true diversity of order 2, i.e. the effective number of types that is obtained when the weighted arithmetic mean is used to quantify average proportional abundance of types in the dataset of interest.\n\nThe index is also as a measure of the [[effective number of parties]].\n\n===Gini\u2013Simpson index===\nThe original Simpson index \u03bb equals the probability that two entities taken at random from the dataset of interest (with replacement) represent the same type.

The entities of interest are usually individual plants or animals, and the measure of abundance can be, for example, number of individuals, biomass or coverage. In [[demography]], the entities of interest can be people, and the types of interest various demographic groups. In [[information science]], the entities can be characters and the types the different letters of the alphabet. The most commonly used diversity indices are simple transformations of the effective number of types (also known as 'true diversity'), but each diversity index can also be interpreted in its own right as a measure corresponding to some real phenomenon (but a different one for each diversity index).<ref name=\"Hill1973\">{{cite journal | last1 = Hill | first1 = M.

Such indices however do not account for the total variation (diversity) that can be held between subjects or entities which occurs only when both categorical and qualitative diversity are calculated.\n\nTrue diversity, or the effective number of types, refers to the number of equally abundant types needed for the average proportional abundance of the types to equal that observed in the dataset of interest (where all types may not be equally abundant). The true diversity in a dataset is calculated by first taking the weighted [[generalized mean]] {{math|''M''<sub>''q''\u22121</sub>}} of the proportional abundances of the types in the dataset, and then taking the [[Multiplicative inverse|reciprocal]] of this. The equation is:<ref name=\"Tuomisto2010a\" /><ref name=\"Tuomisto2010c\" />\n\n:<math>{}^q\\!D={1 \\over M_{q-1}}={1 \\over \\sqrt[q-1]{{\\sum_{i=1}^R p_i p_i^{q-1}}}}=\\left ( {\\sum_{i=1}^R p_i^q} \\right )^{1/(1-q)}</math>\n\nThe [[Fraction (mathematics)|denominator]] {{math|''M''<sub>''q''\u22121</sub>}} equals the average proportional abundance of the types in the dataset as calculated with the weighted [[generalized mean]] with exponent {{math|''q''-1}}. In the equation, {{math|''R''}} is richness (the total number of types in the dataset), and the proportional abundance of the {{math|''i''}}th type is {{math|''p''<sub>''i''</sub>}}. The proportional abundances themselves are used as the nominal weights. The numbers <math>^q D</math> are called '''Hill numbers of order q''' or '''effective number of species'''.<ref>{{Citation|last=Chao|first=Anne|title=Phylogenetic Diversity Measures and Their Decomposition: A Framework Based on Hill Numbers|date=2016|work=Biodiversity Conservation and Phylogenetic Systematics|pages=141\u2013172|publisher=Springer International Publishing|isbn=9783319224602|last2=Chiu|first2=Chun-Huo|last3=Jost|first3=Lou|doi=10.1007/978-3-319-22461-9_8|doi-access=free}}</ref>\n\nWhen {{math|''q'' {{=}} 1}}, the above equation is undefined.  However, the [[Limit (mathematics)|mathematical limit]] as {{math|''q''}} approaches 1 is well defined and the corresponding diversity is calculated with the following equation:\n \n:<math>{}^1\\!D={1 \\over {\\prod_{i=1}^R p_i^{p_i}}} = \\exp\\left(-\\sum_{i=1}^R p_i \\ln(p_i)\\right)</math>\n\nwhich is the exponential of the [[Shannon entropy]] calculated with natural logarithms (see above).  In other domains, this statistic is also known as the ''[[perplexity]]''.\n\nThe value of {{math|''q''}} is often referred to as the order of the diversity. It defines the sensitivity of the diversity value to rare vs. abundant species by modifying how the weighted mean of the species proportional abundances is calculated. With some values of the parameter {{math|''q''}}, the value of {{math|''M''<sub>''q''\u22121</sub>}} assumes familiar kinds of weighted mean as special cases. In particular, {{math|''q'' {{=}} 0}} corresponds to the weighted [[harmonic mean]], {{math|''q'' {{=}} 1}} to the weighted [[geometric mean]] and {{math|''q'' {{=}} 2}} to the weighted [[arithmetic mean]]. As {{math|''q''}} approaches [[infinity]], the weighted generalized mean with exponent {{math|''q''\u22121}} approaches the maximum {{math|''p''<sub>''i''</sub>}} value, which is the proportional abundance of the most abundant species in the dataset. Generally, increasing the value of {{math|''q''}} increases the effective weight given to the most abundant species. This leads to obtaining a larger {{math|''M''<sub>''q''\u22121</sub>}} value and a smaller true diversity ({{math|''<sup>q</sup>D''}}) value with increasing {{math|''q''}}.\n\nWhen {{math|''q'' {{=}} 1}}, the weighted geometric mean of the {{math|''p''<sub>''i''</sub>}} values is used, and each species is exactly weighted by its proportional abundance (in the weighted geometric mean, the weights are the exponents). When {{math|''q'' > 1}}, the weight given to abundant species is exaggerated, and when {{math|''q'' < 1}}, the weight given to rare species is. At {{math|''q'' {{=}} 0}}, the species weights exactly cancel out the species proportional abundances, such that the weighted mean of the {{math|''p''<sub>''i''</sub>}} values equals {{math|1 / ''R''}} even when all species are not equally abundant. At {{math|''q'' {{=}} 0}}, the effective number of species, {{math|<sup>0</sup>''D''}}, hence equals the actual number of species {{math|''R''}}. In the context of diversity, {{math|''q''}} is generally limited to non-negative values. This is because negative values of {{math|''q''}} would give rare species so much more weight than abundant ones that {{math|<sup>''q''</sup>''D''}} would exceed {{math|''R''}}.<ref name=\"Tuomisto2010a\" /><ref name=\"Tuomisto2010c\" />\n\nThe general equation of diversity is often written in the form<ref name=\"Hill1973\" /><ref name=\"Jost2006\" />\n\n:<math>{}^q\\!D=\\left ( {\\sum_{i=1}^R p_i^q} \\right )^{1/(1-q)}</math>\n\nand the term inside the parentheses is called the basic sum. Some popular diversity indices correspond to the basic sum as calculated with different values of {{math|''q''}}.<ref name=\"Jost2006\" />\n\n==See also==\n{{columns-list|colwidth=30em|\n*[[Alpha diversity]]\n*[[Beta diversity]]\n*[[Cultural diversity]]\n*[[Effective number of parties]], a diversity index applied to political parties\n*[[Gamma diversity]]\n*[[Isolation index]]\n*[[Measurement of biodiversity]]\n*[[Qualitative variation]]\n*[[Relative species abundance|Relative abundance]]\n*[[Species diversity]]\n*[[Species richness]]\n}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|32em}}\n\n==Further reading==\n*{{cite book | author=Colinvaux, Paul A. | title=Introduction to Ecology | publisher=Wiley | year=1973 | isbn=0-471-16498-4 | url-access=registration | url=https://archive.org/details/introductiontoec00coli | author-link=Paul Colinvaux }}\n*{{cite book | author=Cover, Thomas M. |author2=Thomas, Joy A. | title = Elements of Information Theory| url=https://archive.org/details/elementsofinform0000cove | url-access=registration | publisher=Wiley | year=1991| isbn=0-471-06259-6}}  See chapter 5 for an elaboration of coding procedures described informally above.\n*{{cite journal | last1 = Chao | first1 = A.|author1-link= Anne Chao | last2 = Shen | first2 = T-J. | year = 2003 | title = Nonparametric estimation of Shannon's index of diversity when there are unseen species in sample | url = http://chao.stat.nthu.edu.tw/paper/2003_EEST_10_P429.pdf | journal = Environmental and Ecological Statistics | volume = 10 | issue = 4 | pages = 429\u2013443 | doi = 10.1023/A:1026096204727 | url-status = dead | archiveurl = http://chao.stat.nthu.edu.tw/paper/2003_EEST_10_P429.pdf | archivedate = 2007-08-12 }}\n\n==External links==\n*[http://www.countrysideinfo.co.uk/simpsons.htm Simpson's Diversity index]\n*[http://www.tiem.utk.edu/~gross/bioed/bealsmodules/simpsonDI.html Diversity indices] gives some examples of estimates of Simpson's index for real ecosystems.\n\n[[Category:Measurement of biodiversity]]\n[[Category:Index numbers]]\n[[Category:Summary statistics for categorical data]]\n", "name_user": "Akrasia25", "label": "safe", "comment": "Cleaned up usingAutoEd", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diversity_index"}

They were available in Milk Chocolate and Peanut varieties. The colors for Mega M&M's were changed to less-bright colors, ostensibly to appeal to older consumers: teal (replacing green), beige (replacing orange), maroon (replacing red), gold (replacing yellow), blue-gray (replacing blue), and brown.\n[[File:MandM Times Square.JPG|left|thumb|220px|Outside of [[M&M's World]] in [[Times Square]], [[New York City]]]]\nIn July 2006, Dark Chocolate M&M's reappeared in a purple package, followed in 2007 by Dark Chocolate Peanut M&M's. Also in 2006, the company piloted White Chocolate M&M's as a tie-in with their ''Pirates of the Caribbean'' promotion. The company also offered eight new flavors of M&M's via online sales, as well as at [[M&M's World]] locations: \"All That Razz\"; \"Eat, Drink, & Be Cherry\"; \"A Day at the Peach\"; \"Orange-U-Glad\"; \"Mint Condition\"; \"AlmonDeeLicious\"; \"Nut What You Think\"; and \"Cookie Monster\".

The website allows for people to log in and create their own character from scratch. They can choose features such as the color, shape, hair, and accessories.\n\nIn 2008, two limited-edition varieties of the candy were introduced \u2013 \"Wildly Cherry\" M&M's, and, as a marketing tie-in with the film ''[[Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull]]'', \"Mint Crisp\" M&M's.\n\nM&M's also introduced another new product called \"M&M's Premiums\" in 2008. They come in five flavors \u2013 chocolate almond, mint chocolate, mocha, raspberry almond, and triple chocolate (milk, dark, and white chocolate), which are sold in small upright cartons with a plastic bag inside. M&M's Premiums do not have a candy shell, but are coated with [[carnauba wax]] and color. Dark chocolate was added in 2009, replacing mocha.\n\nDuring the summer of 2008, My M&M's launched 'Faces,' which allows consumers to print the faces of loved ones on M&M's chocolate candies at mymms.com.\n\nIn February 2009, M&M's launched the \"M&M's Colour Break-Up\" promotion in Australia, where M&M's were sold in separate packs (one for each color): the packs included a code to win prizes.<ref>{{cite news|title=M&M'S Color Break Up|url=http://www.colourbreakup.com.au/html/default.aspx|publisher=Mars|date=February 18, 2009|accessdate=February 18, 2009|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090228205617/http://www.colourbreakup.com.au/html/default.aspx|archive-date=February 28, 2009|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nIn Summer 2009, M&M's launched a limited-edition \"Strawberried Peanut Butter\" variant to tie in with the release of ''[[Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen]]''.

Also that year, M&M's released a White Chocolate flavor for the Easter season. From May 30, 2012, onwards, M&M's will be launched in [[Macau]]. Its Macanese launch language is [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]]. In 2012, Peanut M&M's were produced in the UK in a limited edition \"Red, White and Blues only\" pack, in connection with the country's Diamond Jubilee and [[2012 Summer Olympics]]. The 'M' remains white on the white candies. The commercial advertising this promotional package had Yellow donning various outfits of British stereotypes to try to get into the limited edition pack. Similarly, to promote the [[2014 FIFA World Cup]], Peanut M&M's were produced in a pack that contained only green, yellow, and blue candies, dubbed \"Brazilian M&M's\" in reference to the colors of the flag of Brazil. \"Brazilian M&M's\" were re-released in 2016 to promote the [[2016 Summer Olympics]], but are now available in both Chocolate and Peanut.\n\nIn 2013, M&M's launched the \"Better with M\" campaign, which included cause-related marketing.

Consumers could vote by calling 1-800-FUN-COLOR. Ads for the new blue colors featured a plain and an almond blue M&M character as Red and Yellow take notice of trying to do takes in the commercial by painting themselves blue where they appear on stage with [[B.B. King]] singing the blues, but the filmmakers had to cut the scene as they were not the real blue M&M's; another featured Red and Yellow holding their breath to look like the new blue M&M's, where [[Steven Weber (actor)|Steven Weber]] sees the three M&M's, Red, Yellow, and Blue; and one more featuring Weber talking to the blue M&M if he had dived into the chocolate pool, but did not.\n\nIn 2002, Mars solicited votes in their first ever \"M&M's Global Color Vote\" to add a new color from three choices: [[aqua (color)|aqua]] ([[turquoise (color)|turquoise]]), [[pink]], and [[purple]]. Purple won and was featured for a limited time. To help the colors get votes, [[Ken Schrader]] and his [[MB2 Motorsports]] team, who was sponsored by M&M's at the time, ran four paint schemes during the [[2002 NASCAR Winston Cup Series|2002 NASCAR Winston Cup Series season]] representing the promotion (one for aqua, one for pink, one for purple, and another one with all three colors on the car). Specially marked packages of M&M's were released in Japan. Finding a bag of all purple M&M's entitled the customer to a prize of 100 million [[Japanese Yen|yen]] (equivalent to approximately USD $852,000).\n\nOn January 1, 2004, at the stroke of midnight, Mars removed all of the colors of M&M's and made them black-and-white on both their candies and the packaging. It coincided with a commercial parodying ''[[The Wizard of Oz (1939 film)|The Wizard of Oz]]'' where [[Dorothy Gale|Dorothy]] is home in bed and looks out of the window and sees what the colors of the four M&M's were. The goal was to help the M&M's find their colors in black-and-white packages of M&M's, in this order: brown, orange, red, green, yellow, and blue.

Purple won and was featured for a limited time. To help the colors get votes, [[Ken Schrader]] and his [[MB2 Motorsports]] team, who was sponsored by M&M's at the time, ran four paint schemes during the [[2002 NASCAR Winston Cup Series|2002 NASCAR Winston Cup Series season]] representing the promotion (one for aqua, one for pink, one for purple, and another one with all three colors on the car).

From 1941 until 1969, each package contained M&M's in five different colors; when red M&M's were reintroduced in 1987, they were added as a sixth color instead of replacing any of the existing colors.\n<div class=\"center\">\n<timeline>\nImageSize = width:800 height:200\nPlotArea = left:50 bottom:60 top:0 right:50\nAlignbars = justify\nDateFormat  = yyyy\nPeriod = from:1940 till:2018\nTimeAxis = orientation:horizontal format:yyyy\n\nScaleMajor = unit:year increment:5 start:1940\n\nColors =\n  id:brown   value:rgb(0.32, 0.20, 0.18)\n  id:tan     value:rgb(0.57, 0.44, 0.22)\n  id:red     value:rgb(0.86, 0.08, 0.16)\n  id:orange  value:rgb(0.98, 0.30, 0)\n  id:yellow  value:rgb(0.95, 0.95, 0.05)\n  id:green   value:rgb(0.20, 0.70, 0.34)\n  id:blue    value:rgb(0.05, 0.15, 0.85)\n  id:violet  value:rgb(0.55, 0.27, 0.55)\n  id:purple  value:rgb(0.35, 0.25, 0.35)\nLineData =\n  at:1945 color:black layer:back\n  at:1955 color:black layer:back\n  at:1965 color:black layer:back\n  at:1975 color:black layer:back\n  at:1985 color:black layer:back\n  at:1995 color:black layer:back\n  at:2005 color:black layer:back\n\nBarData =\n  bar:mmbrown  text:\"Brown\"\n  bar:mmyellow text:\"Yellow\"\n  bar:mmgreen  text:\"Green\"\n  bar:mmred1   text:\"Red\"\n  bar:mmorange text:\"Orange\"\n  bar:mmviolet text:\"Violet\"\n  bar:mmtan    text:\"Tan\"\n  bar:mmblue   text:\"Blue\"\n\nPlotData =\n  width:10 textcolor:black align:left anchor:from shift:(10,-4)\n  bar:mmbrown  from:1941 till:end color:brown\n  bar:mmyellow from:1941 till:end color:yellow\n  bar:mmgreen  from:1941 till:end color:green\n  bar:mmviolet from:1941 till:1949 color:violet\n  bar:mmred1   from:1941 till:1976 color:red\n  bar:mmred1   from:1987 till:end color:red\n  bar:mmtan    from:1949 till:1995 color:tan\n  bar:mmorange from:1976 till:end color:orange\n  bar:mmblue   from:1995 till:end color:blue</timeline> 1940\u2012present\n</div>\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|United States}}\n* Similar candies from other companies:\n** [[Smarties]]\n** [[Cadbury]] Gems\n** [[Reese's Pieces]]\n** [[Sixlets]]\n** [[Freia (chocolate)|Freia's]] Non Stop\n** [[List of products manufactured by The Hershey Company#Miscellaneous products|Hershey-ets]]\n\n==References==\n\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Commons category|M&M's}}\n*[http://www.mms.com/ Official website]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20080910125635/http://us.mms.com/us/about/mmshistory/ The History of M&M's Chocolates] from us.mms.com\n\n{{Mars brands}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:MandM's}}\n[[Category:Mars confectionery brands]]\n[[Category:Candy]]\n", "name_user": "Keermetzefrogheere", "label": "vandal", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M%26M%27s"}

Dunham & Company, a Manhattan wholesale dry-goods company, and her mother, Agnes (Gardner) Zimmermann (1883\u20131974), was a teacher. Edward Zimmermann had been raised in the [[Dutch Reformed Church]] and his wife was [[Presbyterianism|Presbyterian]]. Shortly after they married, they joined the [[Episcopal Church in the United States of America|Episcopal]] congregation at Church of the Redeemer, where their daughter was baptized. Her parents were strict about church attendance, and she spent every Sunday there, at morning services, followed by Sunday school, an afternoon prayer meeting, and an evening study group for children.<ref>Kellow, pp. 2\u20134.</ref> Her family was of German and Scottish ancestry.<ref name=\"schumach\">{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/learning/general/onthisday/bday/0116.html|title=Ethel Merman, Queen of Musicals, Dies at 76|last=Schumach|first=Murray|date=February 16, 1984|newspaper=The New York Times|accessdate=September 20, 2014}}</ref>\n\nMerman attended P.S. 4 and [[William Cullen Bryant High School]] (which later named its auditorium in her honor), where she pursued a commercial course that offered secretarial training.<ref>Kellow, pp. 4\u20137.</ref> She was active in numerous extracurricular activities, including the school magazine, the speakers' club, and student council, and she frequented the local music store to peruse the weekly arrivals of new sheet music.<ref>Kellow, p. 7.</ref> On Friday nights, the Zimmermann family took the subway into Manhattan to see the [[vaudeville]] show at the [[Palace Theatre (Broadway)|Palace Theatre]], where Merman saw [[Blossom Seeley]], [[Fanny Brice]], [[Sophie Tucker]], and [[Nora Bayes]].

At this time, she decided the name Ethel Zimmermann was too long for a theater marquee. She considered combining Ethel with Gardner or Hunter, which was her grandmother's maiden name. These considerations caused her father's ire, and she abbreviated Zimmermann to Merman to appease her father.<ref>Kellow, pp. 8\u201313.</ref>\n\n==Career==\n\n===Early career===\nDuring a two-week engagement at a club in midtown Manhattan called Little Russia, Merman met agent Lou Irwin, who arranged for her to audition for [[Archie Mayo]], a film director under contract at [[Warner Bros.]] He offered her an exclusive six-month contract, starting at $125 per week, and Merman quit her day job, only to find herself idle for weeks while waiting to be cast in a film. She finally urged Irwin to try to cancel her agreement with Mayo; instead, he negotiated her a better deal allowing her to perform in clubs while remaining on the Warners payroll. Merman was hired as a [[torch song|torch singer]] at Les Ambassadeurs, where the headliner was [[Jimmy Durante]], and the two became lifelong friends. She caught the attention of columnists such as [[Walter Winchell]] and [[Mark Hellinger]], who began giving her publicity. Soon after, Merman underwent a [[tonsillectomy]] she feared might damage her voice, but after recovering, she discovered it was more powerful than ever.<ref>Kellow, pp. 13\u201319.</ref>\n\nWhile performing on the prestigious [[Benjamin Franklin Keith|Keith Circuit]], Merman was signed to replace [[Ruth Etting]] in the [[Paramount Pictures|Paramount]] film ''[[Follow the Leader (1930 film)|Follow the Leader]]'' (1930), starring [[Ed Wynn]] and [[Ginger Rogers]]. Following a successful seven-week run at the [[Paramount Theatre (Brooklyn, New York)|Brooklyn Paramount]], she was signed to perform at the Palace for $500 per week. During the run, theatre producer [[Vinton Freedley]] saw her perform and invited her to audition for the role of San Francisco caf\u00e9 singer Kate Fothergill in the new [[George Gershwin|George]] and [[Ira Gershwin]] musical ''[[Girl Crazy]]''. Upon hearing her sing \"I Got Rhythm\", the Gershwins immediately cast her, and Merman began juggling daytime rehearsals with her matinee and evening performance schedule at the Palace.<ref>Kellow, pp. 21\u201326.</ref>\n\n''Girl Crazy'' opened on October 14, 1930, at the [[Neil Simon Theatre|Alvin Theatre]], where it ran for 272 performances.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ibdb.com/production.php?id=11231|title=Girl Crazy \u2013 Broadway Musical \u2013 Original - IBDB|first=The Broadway|last=League|publisher=}}</ref> ''The New York Times'' noted Merman sang \"with dash, authority, good voice and just the right knowing style\", and ''The New Yorker'' called her \"imitative of no one.\"<ref name=\"Kellow, p. 30\">Kellow, p. 30.</ref> Merman was fairly blas\u00e9 about her notices, prompting George Gershwin to ask her mother \"Have you ever seen a person so unconcerned as Ethel?\"\n\n[[File:Ethel merman ragtime9.jpg|thumb|left|Ethel Merman with [[Tyrone Power]] in the trailer for ''[[Alexander's Ragtime Band (film)|Alexander's Ragtime Band]]'']]\n\nDuring the run of ''Girl Crazy'', Paramount signed Merman to appear in a series of 10 short musical films, most of which allowed her to sing a rousing number as well as a ballad. She also performed at the Central Park Casino, the [[Paramount Theatre (New York City)|Paramount Theatre]], and a return engagement at the Palace. As soon as ''Girl Crazy'' closed, her parents and she departed for a much-needed vacation in [[Lake George (New York)|Lake George]] in Upstate New York, but after their first day there, Merman was summoned to Atlantic City, New Jersey to help salvage the troubled latest edition of ''[[George White's Scandals]]''. Because she was still under contract to Freedley, White was forced to pay the producer $10,000 for her services, in addition to her weekly $1,500 salary. Following the Atlantic City run, the show played in Newark, New Jersey and then Brooklyn before opening on Broadway, where it ran for 202 performances.<ref>Kellow, pp. 32\u201337.</ref>\n\nMerman's next show, ''Humpty Dumpty'', began rehearsals in August 1932 and opened\u2014and immediately closed\u2014in Pittsburgh the following month. Producer [[Buddy DeSylva]], who also had written the book and lyrics, was certain it could be reworked into a success, and with a revamped script and additional songs by [[Vincent Youmans]],<ref>Kellow, pp. 37\u201340.</ref> it opened with the new title ''[[Take a Chance (1932 musical)|Take a Chance]]'' on November 26 at the 42nd Street Apollo Theatre, where it ran for 243 performances.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ibdb.com/production.php?id=11687|title=Take a Chance \u2013 Broadway Musical \u2013 Original - IBDB|first=The Broadway|last=League|publisher=}}</ref> [[Brooks Atkinson]] of ''The New York Times'' called it \"fast, loud, and funny\" and added Merman \"has never loosed herself with quite so much abandon.\" Following the Broadway run, she agreed to join the show on the road, but shortly after the Chicago opening, she claimed the chlorine in the city's water supply was irritating her throat, and returned to Manhattan.<ref name=\"Kellow, p. 30\"/>\n\nMerman returned to Hollywood to appear in ''[[We're Not Dressing]]'' (1934), a [[screwball comedy]] based on the [[J.M. Barrie]] play ''[[The Admirable Crichton]]''. Despite working with a cast including [[Bing Crosby]], [[Carole Lombard]], and [[Burns and Allen]], under the direction of [[Academy Award for Best Director|Academy Award]]\u2013winning director [[Norman Taurog]], Merman was unhappy with the experience, and she was dismayed to discover one of her musical numbers had been cut when she attended the New York opening with her family and friends. She also appeared on screen with [[Eddie Cantor]] in ''[[Kid Millions]]'' (also 1934), but her return to Broadway established her as a major star and cemented her image as a tough girl.<ref>Kellow, pp. 42\u201367.</ref>\n\n''[[Anything Goes]]'' proved to be the first of five [[Cole Porter]] musicals in which Merman starred. In addition to the title song, the score included \"[[I Get a Kick Out of You]]\", \"[[You're the Top]]\", and \"Blow Gabriel Blow\". It opened on November 21, 1934, at the Alvin Theatre,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ibdb.com/production.php?id=9382|title=Anything Goes \u2013 Broadway Musical \u2013 Original - IBDB|first=The Broadway|last=League|publisher=}}</ref> and the ''New York Post'' called Merman \"vivacious and ingratiating in her comedy moments, and the embodiment of poise and technical adroitness\" when singing \"as only she knows how to do.\" Although Merman always had remained with a show until the end of its run, she left ''Anything Goes'' after eight months to appear with Eddie Cantor in the film ''[[Strike Me Pink (film)|Strike Me Pink]]''. She was replaced by [[Benay Venuta]], with whom she enjoyed a long but frequently tempestuous friendship.<ref>Kellow, pp. 55\u201357.</ref>\n\nMerman initially was overlooked for the film version of ''[[Anything Goes (1936 film)|Anything Goes]]'' (1936). Bing Crosby insisted his wife [[Dixie Lee]] be cast as Reno Sweeney opposite his Billy Crocker, but when she unexpectedly dropped out of the project, Merman was cast in the role she had originated on stage. From the beginning, it was clear to Merman the film would not be the enjoyable experience she had hoped it would be. The focus was shifted to Crosby, leaving her very much in a supporting role. Many of Porter's ribald lyrics were altered to conform to the guidelines of the [[Motion Picture Production Code]], and \"Blow Gabriel Blow\" was eliminated completely, replaced by a song, \"Shang Hai-de-Ho\", that Merman was forced to perform in a headdress made of peacock feathers while surrounded by dancers dressed as Chinese slave girls. The film was completed $201,000 over budget and 17 days behind schedule.

She later said she knew on their wedding night she had made \"a dreadful mistake,\" and two months later, she filed for divorce on grounds of desertion.<ref>Kellow, pp. 87\u201389.</ref> Shortly after she met and married Robert D.

Her next project was ''Sadie Thompson'', a [[Vernon Duke]]\u2013[[Howard Dietz]] musical adaptation of a [[W. Somerset Maugham]] short story, but Merman found she was unable to retain the lyrics and resigned 12 days after rehearsals began.<ref>Kellow, pp. 104\u2013105.</ref>\n\nIn August 1945, while in the hospital recovering from the [[Caesarean section|Caesarean birth]] of her second child, Merman was visited by [[Dorothy Fields]], who proposed she star as [[Annie Oakley]] in a musical her brother [[Herbert Fields|Herbert]] and she were writing with [[Jerome Kern]]. Merman accepted, but in November, Kern suffered a stroke while in New York City visiting Rodgers and Hammerstein (the producers of the show) and died a few days later. [[Richard Rodgers]] and [[Oscar Hammerstein II]] invited [[Irving Berlin]] to replace him,<ref>Kellow, pp. 107.</ref> and the result was ''[[Annie Get Your Gun (musical)|Annie Get Your Gun]]'', which opened on May 16, 1946 at the [[Imperial Theatre (Broadway)|Imperial Theatre]], where it ran for nearly three years and 1,147 performances.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.ibdb.com/broadway-production/annie-get-your-gun-1440|title=Annie Get Your Gun \u2013 Broadway Musical \u2013 Original|website=IBDb.com}}</ref> During this time, Merman took only two vacations and missed only two performances because of illness.<ref>Kellow, p. 116.</ref> Merman lost the film version to [[Judy Garland]], who eventually was replaced by Betty Hutton, but she did star in a Broadway revival two decades later at [[Lincoln Center]] with [[Bruce Yarnell]], who was 27 years Merman's junior, cast as [[Frank E. Butler]], Annie Oakley's loyal husband and manager.\n\nMerman and Berlin reunited for ''[[Call Me Madam]]'' in 1950, for which she won the [[Tony Award for Best Performance by a Leading Actress in a Musical]], and she starred in the [[Call Me Madam (film)|1953 screen adaptation]] as well, winning the [[Golden Globe Award for Best Actress \u2013 Motion Picture Musical or Comedy]] for her performance. The following year, she appeared as the matriarch of the singing and dancing Donahue family in ''[[There's No Business Like Show Business (film)|There's No Business Like Show Business]]'', a film with a Berlin score.\n\nMerman returned to Broadway at the behest of her third husband, [[Continental Airlines]] executive [[Robert Six]], who was upset she had chosen to become a housewife in Colorado following their wedding in 1953. He expected her public appearances to engender publicity for the airline, and her decision to forgo the limelight did not sit well with him. He urged her to accept the lead in ''[[Happy Hunting]]'', with a book by [[Howard Lindsay]] and [[Russel Crouse]] (who had written ''Call Me Madam'') and a score by the unknown team of Harold Karr and Matt Dubey. Merman acquiesced to her husband's demands, although she clashed with the composers from the start and soon was at odds with co-star [[Fernando Lamas]] and his wife [[Arlene Dahl]], who frequently attended rehearsals. Based on the Merman name, the show opened in New York with an advance sale of $1.5 million, and despite the star's dissatisfaction with it, garnered respectable reviews. Although Brooks Atkinson thought the score was \"hardly more than adequate\", he called Merman \"as brassy as ever, glowing like a neon light whenever she steps on the stage.\" Several months into the run, she insisted that two of her least-favorite numbers be replaced by songs written by her friend [[Roger Edens]], who, because of his exclusive contract with [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]], credited them to [[Kay Thompson]]. She lost the Tony Award to [[Judy Holliday]] in ''[[Bells Are Ringing (musical)|Bells Are Ringing]]'', and the show closed after 412 performances, with Merman happy to see what she considered \"a dreary obligation\" finally come to an end.<ref>Kellow, pp. 160\u2013169.</ref>\n\n===Later career===\n''[[Gypsy: A Musical Fable|Gypsy]]'' was based on the memoirs of [[Gypsy Rose Lee]] and starred Merman as her domineering [[stage mother]] [[Rose Thompson Hovick|Rose Hovick]], possibly Merman's best-remembered performance. The musical opened on May 21, 1959, at [[The Broadway Theatre]]. In the ''New York Post,'' Richard Watts called Merman \"a brilliant actress,\" and Brooks Atkinson of ''The New York Times'' wrote that \"She gives an indomitable performance, both as actress and singer.\" Despite the acclaim, Merman lost the [[Tony Award]] to her close friend [[Mary Martin]] in ''[[The Sound of Music]]'' and jokingly quipped \"How are you going to buck a nun?\" Shortly after she divorced Robert Six, his affair with television actress [[Audrey Meadows]] became public, and she found solace in her work.<ref>Kellow, pp. 174&ndash;188</ref>\n\nThroughout the 702-performance run of ''Gypsy,'' [[Mervyn LeRoy]] saw it numerous times, and repeatedly assured Merman that he planned to cast her in the film adaptation he was preparing. However, before the show's closing, it was announced that [[Rosalind Russell]] instead had been signed to star. Russell's husband, [[theatre producer]] Frederick Brisson (whom Merman later called \"the lizard of Roz\"),<ref>{{Cite book|title=Brass Diva: The Life and Legends of Ethel Merman|last=Flinn|first=Caryl|publisher=University of Carlifornia Press|year=2009|isbn=9780520260221|location=Berkeley|pages=311|oclc=264039481}}</ref> had sold the screen rights to the Leonard Spigelgass play ''[[A Majority of One]]'' to [[Warner Bros.]] with the stipulation his wife would star in both films. Because Russell was still a major box-office draw with the success of ''[[Auntie Mame (film)|Auntie Mame]]'' a few years earlier, and Merman never having established herself as a popular screen presence, the studio agreed to Brisson's terms. Merman was devastated at this turn of events and called the loss of the role \"the greatest professional disappointment of my life.\" <ref>Kellow, Brian, pp. 173&ndash;195</ref>\n\nFollowing the Broadway closing of ''Gypsy'' on March 25, 1961, Merman half-heartedly embarked on the national tour. In San Francisco, she severely injured her back, but continued to play to packed houses. During the Los Angeles run, LeRoy visited her backstage and claimed Russell was so ill that \"I think you're going to end up getting this part.\" Believing the film version of ''Gypsy'' was within her grasp, she generously gave him the many house seats he requested for friends and industry colleagues, only to discover she had been duped.<ref>Kellow, pp. 191&ndash;192</ref>\n\nDuring her run in ''Gypsy'', Merman earned an estimated $130,000 per year in the role plus 10% of the box-office receipts.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.upi.com/Archives/1996/01/04/Broadway-pay-rises-Hollywood-style/6842820731600/|title=Broadway pay rises -- Hollywood style|website=Upi.com|accessdate=October 6, 2019}}</ref>\n\nOver the next several years, Merman was featured in two films, the successful ''[[It's a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World]]'' (1963, in which she played Mrs. Marcus, the battle-axe mother in-law of Milton Berle) and the flop ''[[The Art of Love (1965 film)|The Art of Love]]'' (1965). She made dozens of television appearances on variety series hosted by [[Perry Como]], [[Red Skelton]], [[Judy Garland]], [[Dean Martin]], [[Ed Sullivan]], and [[Carol Burnett]], talk shows with [[Mike Douglas]], [[Dick Cavett]], and [[Merv Griffin]], and in episodes of ''[[That Girl]]'', ''[[The Lucy Show]],'' ''[[Match Game]]'', ''[[Batman (TV series)|Batman]],'' ''[[Tarzan (1966 TV series)|Tarzan]],'' and others.\n\nProducer [[David Merrick]] encouraged [[Jerry Herman]] to compose ''[[Hello, Dolly! (musical)|Hello, Dolly!]]'' specifically for Merman's vocal range, but when he offered her the role, she declined it. She finally joined the cast on March 28, 1970, six years after the production opened. On Merman's opening night, her performance was continually brought to a halt by prolonged standing ovations, and the critics unanimously heralded her return to the New York stage. [[Walter Kerr]] in ''The New York Times'' described her voice: \"Exactly as trumpet-clean, exactly as penny whistle-piercing, exactly as Wurlitzer-wonderful as it always was.\" He wrote: \"Her comic sense is every bit as authoritative, as high-handed, really, as her voice.\"<ref>Kerr, Walter.[https://www.nytimes.com/1970/04/12/archives/merman-a-kid-who-wins-all-the-marbles-merman-wins.html?sq=%2522Ethel+Merman%2522&scp=1&st=p \"Merman: A Kid Who Wins All the Marbles; Merman Wins\"] ''The New York Times'' (abstract), April 12, 1970, p.D1</ref> The seventh actress to portray the scheming matchmaker in the original Broadway production, she remained with the musical for 210 performances until it closed on December 27, 1970. Merman received the [[Drama Desk Award]] for Outstanding Performance for what proved to be her last appearance on Broadway.\n\nFor the remainder of her career, Merman worked as frequently as offers were made. In 1979, she recorded ''[[The Ethel Merman Disco Album]],'' with many of her signature songs are set to a [[disco]] beat. Her last screen role was a self-parody in the 1980 comedy film ''[[Airplane!]],'' in which she portrayed Lieutenant Hurwitz, a shell-shocked soldier who thinks he is Ethel Merman. In the cameo appearance, Merman leaps out of bed singing \"[[Everything's Coming Up Roses]]\" as orderlies sedate her. She also appeared in several episodes of ''[[The Love Boat]]'' (playing Gopher's mother), guest-starred on a CBS tribute to George Gershwin, did a summer comedy/concert tour with [[Carroll O'Connor]], played a two-week engagement at the [[London Palladium]], performed with Mary Martin in a concert benefiting the theatre and museum collection of the [[Museum of the City of New York]], and frequently appeared as a soloist with symphony orchestras. She also volunteered at St. Luke's-Roosevelt Hospital Center (now [[Mount Sinai West (hospital)|Mount Sinai West]]) working in the gift shop or visiting patients.\n\n===Performance style===\nMerman was known for her powerful, [[Vocal belting|belting]] [[mezzo-soprano]] voice and precise [[enunciation]] and pitch.<ref>{{cite web|\nurl=http://www.classicalsource.com/db_control/db_features.php?id=5388|\ntitle=Ethel Merman: A 100th-Anniversary Tribute |\naccessdate=April 23, 2009|\nauthor=Michael Darvell|\npublisher=classicalsource.com}}</ref> Because stage singers performed without [[microphone]]s when Merman began singing professionally, she had a great advantage, despite never taking singing lessons.

Edward Zimmermann had been raised in the [[Dutch Reformed Church]] and his wife was [[Presbyterianism|Presbyterian]]. Shortly after they married, they joined the [[Episcopal Church in the United States of America|Episcopal]] congregation at Church of the Redeemer, where their daughter was baptized. Her parents were strict about church attendance, and she spent every Sunday there, at morning services, followed by Sunday school, an afternoon prayer meeting, and an evening study group for children.<ref>Kellow, pp. 2\u20134.</ref> Her family was of German and Scottish ancestry.<ref name=\"schumach\">{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/learning/general/onthisday/bday/0116.html|title=Ethel Merman, Queen of Musicals, Dies at 76|last=Schumach|first=Murray|date=February 16, 1984|newspaper=The New York Times|accessdate=September 20, 2014}}</ref>\n\nMerman attended P.S. 4 and [[William Cullen Bryant High School]] (which later named its auditorium in her honor), where she pursued a commercial course that offered secretarial training.<ref>Kellow, pp. 4\u20137.</ref> She was active in numerous extracurricular activities, including the school magazine, the speakers' club, and student council, and she frequented the local music store to peruse the weekly arrivals of new sheet music.<ref>Kellow, p. 7.</ref> On Friday nights, the Zimmermann family took the subway into Manhattan to see the [[vaudeville]] show at the [[Palace Theatre (Broadway)|Palace Theatre]], where Merman saw [[Blossom Seeley]], [[Fanny Brice]], [[Sophie Tucker]], and [[Nora Bayes]]. At home, she tried to emulate their singing styles, but her own distinctive voice was difficult to disguise.<ref>Kellow, p. 6.</ref>\n\nAfter graduating from Bryant High School in 1924, Merman was hired as a [[stenographer]] by the Boyce-Ite Company. One day during her lunch break, she met [[Victor William Kliesrath|Vic Kliesrath]], who offered her a job at the [[Bragg-Kliesrath Corporation]] for a $5 increase above the weekly $23 salary she was earning, and Merman accepted the offer.<ref name=\"Ethel Merman a Life\" /> She eventually was made personal secretary to company president [[Caleb Bragg]], whose frequent lengthy absences from the office to race automobiles allowed her to catch up on the sleep she had lost the previous night when she was out late performing at private parties.<ref name=\"Ethel Merman a Life\">{{cite book|last=Kellow|first=Brian|title=Ethel Merman : a life|year=2008|publisher=Penguin Books|location=New York|isbn=9780143114208|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OJK5VL5dr8IC&pg=PT24&lpg=PT24&dq=Bragg-Kliesrath+brake&source=bl&ots=j83UlD9ptQ&sig=iZttGyZx6-hOT2wPH-8-W64z5Sk&hl=en&sa=X&ei=szCHUNfTOKTtygGC2IHgBQ&ved=0CDMQ6AEwAA}}</ref> During this period, Merman also began appearing in [[nightclub]]s, first hired by [[Jimmy Durante]]'s partner [[Lou Clayton]]. At this time, she decided the name Ethel Zimmermann was too long for a theater marquee. She considered combining Ethel with Gardner or Hunter, which was her grandmother's maiden name. These considerations caused her father's ire, and she abbreviated Zimmermann to Merman to appease her father.<ref>Kellow, pp. 8\u201313.</ref>\n\n==Career==\n\n===Early career===\nDuring a two-week engagement at a club in midtown Manhattan called Little Russia, Merman met agent Lou Irwin, who arranged for her to audition for [[Archie Mayo]], a film director under contract at [[Warner Bros.]] He offered her an exclusive six-month contract, starting at $125 per week, and Merman quit her day job, only to find herself idle for weeks while waiting to be cast in a film. She finally urged Irwin to try to cancel her agreement with Mayo; instead, he negotiated her a better deal allowing her to perform in clubs while remaining on the Warners payroll. Merman was hired as a [[torch song|torch singer]] at Les Ambassadeurs, where the headliner was [[Jimmy Durante]], and the two became lifelong friends. She caught the attention of columnists such as [[Walter Winchell]] and [[Mark Hellinger]], who began giving her publicity. Soon after, Merman underwent a [[tonsillectomy]] she feared might damage her voice, but after recovering, she discovered it was more powerful than ever.<ref>Kellow, pp. 13\u201319.</ref>\n\nWhile performing on the prestigious [[Benjamin Franklin Keith|Keith Circuit]], Merman was signed to replace [[Ruth Etting]] in the [[Paramount Pictures|Paramount]] film ''[[Follow the Leader (1930 film)|Follow the Leader]]'' (1930), starring [[Ed Wynn]] and [[Ginger Rogers]]. Following a successful seven-week run at the [[Paramount Theatre (Brooklyn, New York)|Brooklyn Paramount]], she was signed to perform at the Palace for $500 per week. During the run, theatre producer [[Vinton Freedley]] saw her perform and invited her to audition for the role of San Francisco caf\u00e9 singer Kate Fothergill in the new [[George Gershwin|George]] and [[Ira Gershwin]] musical ''[[Girl Crazy]]''. Upon hearing her sing \"I Got Rhythm\", the Gershwins immediately cast her, and Merman began juggling daytime rehearsals with her matinee and evening performance schedule at the Palace.<ref>Kellow, pp. 21\u201326.</ref>\n\n''Girl Crazy'' opened on October 14, 1930, at the [[Neil Simon Theatre|Alvin Theatre]], where it ran for 272 performances.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ibdb.com/production.php?id=11231|title=Girl Crazy \u2013 Broadway Musical \u2013 Original - IBDB|first=The Broadway|last=League|publisher=}}</ref> ''The New York Times'' noted Merman sang \"with dash, authority, good voice and just the right knowing style\", and ''The New Yorker'' called her \"imitative of no one.\"<ref name=\"Kellow, p. 30\">Kellow, p. 30.</ref> Merman was fairly blas\u00e9 about her notices, prompting George Gershwin to ask her mother \"Have you ever seen a person so unconcerned as Ethel?\"\n\n[[File:Ethel merman ragtime9.jpg|thumb|left|Ethel Merman with [[Tyrone Power]] in the trailer for ''[[Alexander's Ragtime Band (film)|Alexander's Ragtime Band]]'']]\n\nDuring the run of ''Girl Crazy'', Paramount signed Merman to appear in a series of 10 short musical films, most of which allowed her to sing a rousing number as well as a ballad. She also performed at the Central Park Casino, the [[Paramount Theatre (New York City)|Paramount Theatre]], and a return engagement at the Palace. As soon as ''Girl Crazy'' closed, her parents and she departed for a much-needed vacation in [[Lake George (New York)|Lake George]] in Upstate New York, but after their first day there, Merman was summoned to Atlantic City, New Jersey to help salvage the troubled latest edition of ''[[George White's Scandals]]''. Because she was still under contract to Freedley, White was forced to pay the producer $10,000 for her services, in addition to her weekly $1,500 salary. Following the Atlantic City run, the show played in Newark, New Jersey and then Brooklyn before opening on Broadway, where it ran for 202 performances.<ref>Kellow, pp. 32\u201337.</ref>\n\nMerman's next show, ''Humpty Dumpty'', began rehearsals in August 1932 and opened\u2014and immediately closed\u2014in Pittsburgh the following month. Producer [[Buddy DeSylva]], who also had written the book and lyrics, was certain it could be reworked into a success, and with a revamped script and additional songs by [[Vincent Youmans]],<ref>Kellow, pp. 37\u201340.</ref> it opened with the new title ''[[Take a Chance (1932 musical)|Take a Chance]]'' on November 26 at the 42nd Street Apollo Theatre, where it ran for 243 performances.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ibdb.com/production.php?id=11687|title=Take a Chance \u2013 Broadway Musical \u2013 Original - IBDB|first=The Broadway|last=League|publisher=}}</ref> [[Brooks Atkinson]] of ''The New York Times'' called it \"fast, loud, and funny\" and added Merman \"has never loosed herself with quite so much abandon.\" Following the Broadway run, she agreed to join the show on the road, but shortly after the Chicago opening, she claimed the chlorine in the city's water supply was irritating her throat, and returned to Manhattan.<ref name=\"Kellow, p. 30\"/>\n\nMerman returned to Hollywood to appear in ''[[We're Not Dressing]]'' (1934), a [[screwball comedy]] based on the [[J.M. Barrie]] play ''[[The Admirable Crichton]]''. Despite working with a cast including [[Bing Crosby]], [[Carole Lombard]], and [[Burns and Allen]], under the direction of [[Academy Award for Best Director|Academy Award]]\u2013winning director [[Norman Taurog]], Merman was unhappy with the experience, and she was dismayed to discover one of her musical numbers had been cut when she attended the New York opening with her family and friends. She also appeared on screen with [[Eddie Cantor]] in ''[[Kid Millions]]'' (also 1934), but her return to Broadway established her as a major star and cemented her image as a tough girl.<ref>Kellow, pp. 42\u201367.</ref>\n\n''[[Anything Goes]]'' proved to be the first of five [[Cole Porter]] musicals in which Merman starred. In addition to the title song, the score included \"[[I Get a Kick Out of You]]\", \"[[You're the Top]]\", and \"Blow Gabriel Blow\". It opened on November 21, 1934, at the Alvin Theatre,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ibdb.com/production.php?id=9382|title=Anything Goes \u2013 Broadway Musical \u2013 Original - IBDB|first=The Broadway|last=League|publisher=}}</ref> and the ''New York Post'' called Merman \"vivacious and ingratiating in her comedy moments, and the embodiment of poise and technical adroitness\" when singing \"as only she knows how to do.\" Although Merman always had remained with a show until the end of its run, she left ''Anything Goes'' after eight months to appear with Eddie Cantor in the film ''[[Strike Me Pink (film)|Strike Me Pink]]''. She was replaced by [[Benay Venuta]], with whom she enjoyed a long but frequently tempestuous friendship.<ref>Kellow, pp. 55\u201357.</ref>\n\nMerman initially was overlooked for the film version of ''[[Anything Goes (1936 film)|Anything Goes]]'' (1936). Bing Crosby insisted his wife [[Dixie Lee]] be cast as Reno Sweeney opposite his Billy Crocker, but when she unexpectedly dropped out of the project, Merman was cast in the role she had originated on stage. From the beginning, it was clear to Merman the film would not be the enjoyable experience she had hoped it would be. The focus was shifted to Crosby, leaving her very much in a supporting role. Many of Porter's ribald lyrics were altered to conform to the guidelines of the [[Motion Picture Production Code]], and \"Blow Gabriel Blow\" was eliminated completely, replaced by a song, \"Shang Hai-de-Ho\", that Merman was forced to perform in a headdress made of peacock feathers while surrounded by dancers dressed as Chinese slave girls. The film was completed $201,000 over budget and 17 days behind schedule. [[Richard Watts, Jr.]] of the ''New York Herald Tribune'' described it as \"dull and commonplace\", with Merman doing \"as well as possible\", but unable to register \"on screen as magnificently as she does on stage.\"<ref>Kellow, pp. 57\u201359.</ref>\n\n[[File:EthelMermanNoBusinesstrailer.jpg|thumb|right|In the film trailer for ''[[There's No Business Like Show Business (film)|There's No Business Like Show Business]]'' (1954)]]\n\nMerman returned to Broadway for another Porter musical, but despite the presence of Jimmy Durante and [[Bob Hope]] in the cast, ''[[Red, Hot and Blue]]'' closed after less than six months.<ref>[http://www.ibdb.com/production.php?id=12157 ''Red, Hot and Blue''] at the Internet Broadway Database</ref> Back in Hollywood, Merman was featured in ''[[Happy Landing (1938 film)|Happy Landing]]'', one of the top 10 box-office hits of 1938 comedy with [[Sonja Henie]], [[Cesar Romero]] and [[Don Ameche]]; another the box-office hit ''[[Alexander's Ragtime Band (film)|Alexander's Ragtime Band]]'', a pastiche of [[Irving Berlin]] songs interpolated into a plot that vaguely paralleled the composer's life; and ''[[Straight Place and Show]]'', a critical and commercial flop starring the [[Ritz Brothers]].<ref>Kellow, pp. 69\u201371.</ref> She returned to the stage in ''Stars in Your Eyes'', which struggled to survive while the public flocked to the [[1939 New York World's Fair]] instead, and finally closed short of four months.<ref>Kellow, p. 75.</ref> Merman followed this with two more Porter musicals.

She later said she knew on their wedding night she had made \"a dreadful mistake,\" and two months later, she filed for divorce on grounds of desertion.<ref>Kellow, pp. 87\u201389.</ref> Shortly after she met and married Robert D.

Her next project was ''Sadie Thompson'', a [[Vernon Duke]]\u2013[[Howard Dietz]] musical adaptation of a [[W.

Merman accepted, but in November, Kern suffered a stroke while in New York City visiting Rodgers and Hammerstein (the producers of the show) and died a few days later. [[Richard Rodgers]] and [[Oscar Hammerstein II]] invited [[Irving Berlin]] to replace him,<ref>Kellow, pp. 107.</ref> and the result was ''[[Annie Get Your Gun (musical)|Annie Get Your Gun]]'', which opened on May 16, 1946 at the [[Imperial Theatre (Broadway)|Imperial Theatre]], where it ran for nearly three years and 1,147 performances.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.ibdb.com/broadway-production/annie-get-your-gun-1440|title=Annie Get Your Gun \u2013 Broadway Musical \u2013 Original|website=IBDb.com}}</ref> During this time, Merman took only two vacations and missed only two performances because of illness.<ref>Kellow, p. 116.</ref> Merman lost the film version to [[Judy Garland]], who eventually was replaced by Betty Hutton, but she did star in a Broadway revival two decades later at [[Lincoln Center]] with [[Bruce Yarnell]], who was 27 years Merman's junior, cast as [[Frank E. Butler]], Annie Oakley's loyal husband and manager.\n\nMerman and Berlin reunited for ''[[Call Me Madam]]'' in 1950, for which she won the [[Tony Award for Best Performance by a Leading Actress in a Musical]], and she starred in the [[Call Me Madam (film)|1953 screen adaptation]] as well, winning the [[Golden Globe Award for Best Actress \u2013 Motion Picture Musical or Comedy]] for her performance. The following year, she appeared as the matriarch of the singing and dancing Donahue family in ''[[There's No Business Like Show Business (film)|There's No Business Like Show Business]]'', a film with a Berlin score.\n\nMerman returned to Broadway at the behest of her third husband, [[Continental Airlines]] executive [[Robert Six]], who was upset she had chosen to become a housewife in Colorado following their wedding in 1953. He expected her public appearances to engender publicity for the airline, and her decision to forgo the limelight did not sit well with him. He urged her to accept the lead in ''[[Happy Hunting]]'', with a book by [[Howard Lindsay]] and [[Russel Crouse]] (who had written ''Call Me Madam'') and a score by the unknown team of Harold Karr and Matt Dubey. Merman acquiesced to her husband's demands, although she clashed with the composers from the start and soon was at odds with co-star [[Fernando Lamas]] and his wife [[Arlene Dahl]], who frequently attended rehearsals. Based on the Merman name, the show opened in New York with an advance sale of $1.5 million, and despite the star's dissatisfaction with it, garnered respectable reviews. Although Brooks Atkinson thought the score was \"hardly more than adequate\", he called Merman \"as brassy as ever, glowing like a neon light whenever she steps on the stage.\" Several months into the run, she insisted that two of her least-favorite numbers be replaced by songs written by her friend [[Roger Edens]], who, because of his exclusive contract with [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]], credited them to [[Kay Thompson]]. She lost the Tony Award to [[Judy Holliday]] in ''[[Bells Are Ringing (musical)|Bells Are Ringing]]'', and the show closed after 412 performances, with Merman happy to see what she considered \"a dreary obligation\" finally come to an end.<ref>Kellow, pp. 160\u2013169.</ref>\n\n===Later career===\n''[[Gypsy: A Musical Fable|Gypsy]]'' was based on the memoirs of [[Gypsy Rose Lee]] and starred Merman as her domineering [[stage mother]] [[Rose Thompson Hovick|Rose Hovick]], possibly Merman's best-remembered performance. The musical opened on May 21, 1959, at [[The Broadway Theatre]]. In the ''New York Post,'' Richard Watts called Merman \"a brilliant actress,\" and Brooks Atkinson of ''The New York Times'' wrote that \"She gives an indomitable performance, both as actress and singer.\" Despite the acclaim, Merman lost the [[Tony Award]] to her close friend [[Mary Martin]] in ''[[The Sound of Music]]'' and jokingly quipped \"How are you going to buck a nun?\" Shortly after she divorced Robert Six, his affair with television actress [[Audrey Meadows]] became public, and she found solace in her work.<ref>Kellow, pp. 174&ndash;188</ref>\n\nThroughout the 702-performance run of ''Gypsy,'' [[Mervyn LeRoy]] saw it numerous times, and repeatedly assured Merman that he planned to cast her in the film adaptation he was preparing. However, before the show's closing, it was announced that [[Rosalind Russell]] instead had been signed to star. Russell's husband, [[theatre producer]] Frederick Brisson (whom Merman later called \"the lizard of Roz\"),<ref>{{Cite book|title=Brass Diva: The Life and Legends of Ethel Merman|last=Flinn|first=Caryl|publisher=University of Carlifornia Press|year=2009|isbn=9780520260221|location=Berkeley|pages=311|oclc=264039481}}</ref> had sold the screen rights to the Leonard Spigelgass play ''[[A Majority of One]]'' to [[Warner Bros.]] with the stipulation his wife would star in both films. Because Russell was still a major box-office draw with the success of ''[[Auntie Mame (film)|Auntie Mame]]'' a few years earlier, and Merman never having established herself as a popular screen presence, the studio agreed to Brisson's terms. Merman was devastated at this turn of events and called the loss of the role \"the greatest professional disappointment of my life.\" <ref>Kellow, Brian, pp. 173&ndash;195</ref>\n\nFollowing the Broadway closing of ''Gypsy'' on March 25, 1961, Merman half-heartedly embarked on the national tour. In San Francisco, she severely injured her back, but continued to play to packed houses. During the Los Angeles run, LeRoy visited her backstage and claimed Russell was so ill that \"I think you're going to end up getting this part.\" Believing the film version of ''Gypsy'' was within her grasp, she generously gave him the many house seats he requested for friends and industry colleagues, only to discover she had been duped.<ref>Kellow, pp. 191&ndash;192</ref>\n\nDuring her run in ''Gypsy'', Merman earned an estimated $130,000 per year in the role plus 10% of the box-office receipts.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.upi.com/Archives/1996/01/04/Broadway-pay-rises-Hollywood-style/6842820731600/|title=Broadway pay rises -- Hollywood style|website=Upi.com|accessdate=October 6, 2019}}</ref>\n\nOver the next several years, Merman was featured in two films, the successful ''[[It's a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World]]'' (1963, in which she played Mrs. Marcus, the battle-axe mother in-law of Milton Berle) and the flop ''[[The Art of Love (1965 film)|The Art of Love]]'' (1965). She made dozens of television appearances on variety series hosted by [[Perry Como]], [[Red Skelton]], [[Judy Garland]], [[Dean Martin]], [[Ed Sullivan]], and [[Carol Burnett]], talk shows with [[Mike Douglas]], [[Dick Cavett]], and [[Merv Griffin]], and in episodes of ''[[That Girl]]'', ''[[The Lucy Show]],'' ''[[Match Game]]'', ''[[Batman (TV series)|Batman]],'' ''[[Tarzan (1966 TV series)|Tarzan]],'' and others.\n\nProducer [[David Merrick]] encouraged [[Jerry Herman]] to compose ''[[Hello, Dolly! (musical)|Hello, Dolly!]]'' specifically for Merman's vocal range, but when he offered her the role, she declined it. She finally joined the cast on March 28, 1970, six years after the production opened. On Merman's opening night, her performance was continually brought to a halt by prolonged standing ovations, and the critics unanimously heralded her return to the New York stage. [[Walter Kerr]] in ''The New York Times'' described her voice: \"Exactly as trumpet-clean, exactly as penny whistle-piercing, exactly as Wurlitzer-wonderful as it always was.\" He wrote: \"Her comic sense is every bit as authoritative, as high-handed, really, as her voice.\"<ref>Kerr, Walter.[https://www.nytimes.com/1970/04/12/archives/merman-a-kid-who-wins-all-the-marbles-merman-wins.html?sq=%2522Ethel+Merman%2522&scp=1&st=p \"Merman: A Kid Who Wins All the Marbles; Merman Wins\"] ''The New York Times'' (abstract), April 12, 1970, p.D1</ref> The seventh actress to portray the scheming matchmaker in the original Broadway production, she remained with the musical for 210 performances until it closed on December 27, 1970. Merman received the [[Drama Desk Award]] for Outstanding Performance for what proved to be her last appearance on Broadway.\n\nFor the remainder of her career, Merman worked as frequently as offers were made. In 1979, she recorded ''[[The Ethel Merman Disco Album]],'' with many of her signature songs are set to a [[disco]] beat. Her last screen role was a self-parody in the 1980 comedy film ''[[Airplane!]],'' in which she portrayed Lieutenant Hurwitz, a shell-shocked soldier who thinks he is Ethel Merman. In the cameo appearance, Merman leaps out of bed singing \"[[Everything's Coming Up Roses]]\" as orderlies sedate her. She also appeared in several episodes of ''[[The Love Boat]]'' (playing Gopher's mother), guest-starred on a CBS tribute to George Gershwin, did a summer comedy/concert tour with [[Carroll O'Connor]], played a two-week engagement at the [[London Palladium]], performed with Mary Martin in a concert benefiting the theatre and museum collection of the [[Museum of the City of New York]], and frequently appeared as a soloist with symphony orchestras. She also volunteered at St. Luke's-Roosevelt Hospital Center (now [[Mount Sinai West (hospital)|Mount Sinai West]]) working in the gift shop or visiting patients.\n\n===Performance style===\nMerman was known for her powerful, [[Vocal belting|belting]] [[mezzo-soprano]] voice and precise [[enunciation]] and pitch.<ref>{{cite web|\nurl=http://www.classicalsource.com/db_control/db_features.php?id=5388|\ntitle=Ethel Merman: A 100th-Anniversary Tribute |\naccessdate=April 23, 2009|\nauthor=Michael Darvell|\npublisher=classicalsource.com}}</ref> Because stage singers performed without [[microphone]]s when Merman began singing professionally, she had a great advantage, despite never taking singing lessons.

However, after undergoing exploratory surgery on April 11, Merman was diagnosed with stage 4 [[glioblastoma]].<ref name=\"flinn410\">Flinn 2007 p. 410</ref> ''The New York Times'' reported that she underwent brain surgery to have the tumor removed, but it was inoperable and her condition was deemed terminal (doctors had given Merman eight and half months to live).<ref name=\"flinn410\"/><ref name=\"kellow262\">Kellow 2007 p. 262</ref> The tumor caused Merman to become [[aphasic]], and as her illness progressed, she lost her hair and her face swelled.<ref name=\"flinn411\">Flinn 2007 p. 411</ref><ref>{{cite book|last=Mark|first=Geoffrey|title=Ethel Merman: The Biggest Star on Broadway|year=2006|publisher=Barricade Legend|isbn=1-569-80293-9|page=[https://archive.org/details/ethelmermanbigge0000mark/page/204 204]|url=https://archive.org/details/ethelmermanbigge0000mark/page/204}}</ref> According to Merman biographer Brian Kellow, Merman's family and manager did not want the true nature of her condition revealed to the public.<ref name=\"kellow262\"/> Merman's son Robert, Jr., who took charge of her care, later said he chose not to publicly disclose his mother's true condition because Merman strove to keep her personal life private.

Originating in Italy during the Middle Ages, it was often based on local events; individual tales often were gathered into collections. The novella developed into a psychologically subtle and structured short tale, with writers frequently using a frame story to unify tales around a theme, as in Giovanni Boccaccio's ''Decameron''.}}</ref> written by [[Miguel de Cervantes]] between 1590 and 1612. The collection was printed in Madrid in 1613 by [[Juan de la Cuesta]], and received well in the wake of the first part of ''[[Don Quixote]]''.\n\nCervantes boasted in his foreword to have been the first to write ''novelas'' in the Spanish language:\n<blockquote>My genius and my inclination prompt me to this kind of writing; the more so as I consider (and with truth) that I am the first who has written novels in the Spanish language, though many have hitherto appeared among us, all of them translated from foreign authors. But these are my own, neither imitated nor stolen from anyone; my genius has engendered them, my pen has brought them forth, and they are growing up in the arms of the press.<ref>{{cite web  | title = E-book of The Exemplary Novels of Cervantes (Translated by Walter K. Kelly) | work = The Project Gutenberg | last = Cervantes Saavedra | first = Miguel de | url = http://www.gutenberg.org/files/14420/14420-8.txt | accessdate = 2008-11-04}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nThe novellas are usually grouped into two series: those characterized by an idealized nature and those of a realistic nature. Those idealized in nature, which are the closest to the Italian models, are characterized by plots dealing with amorous entanglements, by improbable plots, by the presence of idealized characters and psychological development, and the low reflection of reality. They include: ''[[El amante liberal]]'', ''[[Las dos doncellas]]'', ''[[La espa\u00f1ola inglesa]]'', ''[[La se\u00f1ora Cornelia]]'' and ''[[La fuerza de la sangre]]''. These were the most popular of the novellas at the time. The realistic in nature cater to the descriptions of realistic characters and environments, with intentional criticism in many cases. The realistic in nature are the best-known stories today: ''[[Rinconete y Cortadillo]]'', ''[[El licenciado Vidriera]]'', ''[[La gitanilla]]'', ''[[El casamiento enga\u00f1oso]]'' (which leads directly into the [[fantasy]] ''[[El coloquio de los perros]]''), and ''[[La ilustre fregona]]''.  However, the separation between the two groups is not sharp and elements of the idealistic may be found in some of the realistic novels.\n\nSince there are multiple versions of two of these stories, it is believed that Cervantes introduced some variations in these novels for moral, social and aesthetic purposes (hence the name 'exemplary'). The more primitive versions were found in the manuscript, now lost, called by the name of its one-time possessor, [[Porras de la C\u00e1mara]], a miscellaneous collection of various literary works which include a novel usually attributed to Cervantes, ''[[La t\u00eda fingida]]''. On the other hand, some short stories are also embedded in ''Don Quixote'', such as ''El curioso impertinente'' or ''Historia del cautivo'', and where a character possesses a manuscript of ''Rinconete y Cortadillo'', unpublished at the time (1605).\n\n==Influence and adaptations==\nCervantes' novellas inspired several English Jacobean dramas, whose authors might have read them either  in French translation or in the Spanish original.  Plays based on the novellas include Beaumont and Fletcher's ''[[Love's Pilgrimage (play)|Love's Pilgrimage]]'' (adapted from \"Las dos doncellas\"), Fletcher's ''[[The Chances]]'' (\"La Se\u00f1ora Cornelia\"), Fletcher's ''[[Rule a Wife and Have a Wife]]'' (\"El casamiento enga\u00f1oso\"), and Middleton's ''[[The Spanish Gypsy]]'' (\"La fuerza de la sangre\" and \"La gitanilla\"), among others.<ref>Wilson 37-45; Ardila, 5.</ref>\n\n==The short stories==\n*''[[La gitanilla]]''\nStory of a young man who falls in love with a gypsy. She asks him to be with her as a gypsy for two years. Later it is discovered that she is the lost daughter of the governor. He gets thrown into jail, but is later released when it's revealed that he is of knightly descent. The two marry, and live happily.\n*''[[El amante liberal]]''\nThe story of Ricardo and Leonisa. When their ship sinks, Ricardo believes that Leonisa is dead. He discovers she is alive later, when she is being sold off as a slave. The Cadi wants her for himself, surprised by her beauty and charm, thinking of getting rid of his wife so he can keep her, but Ricardo recovers her to love her properly.\n*''[[Rinconete y Cortadillo]]''\n*''[[La espa\u00f1ola inglesa]]''\nA seven-year-old girl named Isabela is kidnapped by an Englishman. She serves him as a servant, and his son falls in love with her because of her beauty. Since their love is mutual, they go to the Queen so she can approve of their union. She is impressed by Isabela's beauty and makes the boy,  prove himself worthy of her. He starts fighting off Turkish ships, and releases Spanish prisoners. He meets Isabela's parents, but keeps quiet about knowing her. Her parents meet up with her. \nRicaredo's and Isabela's wedding is interrupted by the servant's son, who fell in love with her. The Queen sends Isabela back to Spain, calling the wedding off. The servant, blinded by anger, poisons Isabela. She gets treated right in time, but the poison's side effects diminish her beauty. She becomes ugly. She returns to Spain, ready to enter a convent, since Ricaredo never comes. Ricaredo is about to marry another woman, but during a Turkish war he is wounded, and everyone believes he is dead. He returns to Spain, meets up with Isabela and marries her.\n*''[[El licenciado Vidriera]]''\n\nTom\u00e1s Rodaja, a young boy, is found by strangers, apparently abandoned. He impresses them with his wit and intelligence enough for them to take him on as a sort of adoptive son. Tom\u00e1s is sent to school, where he becomes famous for his learning; he grows up, travels all over Europe, and eventually settles in Salamanca, where he completes a degree in law.\n\nIn love with Tom\u00e1s, a young woman procures an intended love potion, with which she laces a quince that Tom\u00e1s eats. The potion does not work, instead putting Tom\u00e1s in a grave state for months (the woman flees and is never heard from again).\n\nWhen he re-emerges from convalescence Tom\u00e1s is physically restored but delusional \u2013 chiefly, Tom\u00e1s is convinced that his whole body is composed entirely of glass. His unshakable belief, combined with Tom\u00e1s' clever, memorable aphorisms in conversation with everyone he meets, make Tom\u00e1s famous throughout Spain, where he becomes known as 'Vidriera' \u2013 from the Spanish vidrio, which means 'glass'. Eventually, Tom\u00e1s is invited to court, transported in a carriage packed with hay.\n\nWith time, Tom\u00e1s recovers his sanity, only to discover to his horror throngs of people who never leave him alone, wanting to see the famous 'Vidriera'. Repulsed by fame and unable to continue as a lawyer, Tom\u00e1s joins the army as an infantryman, eventually dying in an obscure battle.\n\n*''[[La fuerza de la sangre]]''\n*''[[El celoso extreme\u00f1o]]''\n\nFilipo de Carrizales, a former soldier, who after much financial success abroad in \"las Indias\" (the term with which the author refers to America - particularly mentioning Peru), settles in Sevilla, succumbing to the desire every man has to return to his homeland; as Cervantes writes, \"tocado del natural deseo que todos tienen de volver a su patria\". He falls in love with a young and beautiful girl called Leonora. Despite being from a poor family, she comes from a noble one and he decides to love and protect her, seeing her worthy character through her poverty. He takes every precaution to protect her from the outside world and from other men, allowing no-one to pass through the second inner door, apart from the female servants or the black eunuch, this being the only male allowed into her presence. By doing this and by bringing her presents he was protecting her from the industry and the cursed humanity that could perturb her serenity, \"por ninguna v\u00eda la industria ni la malicia humana pod\u00eda perturbar su sosiego\".\n\nThis plan is foiled by a younger man, Loaysa, who manages to enter and seduce Leonora by means of a very intricate plan. In the closing moments Carrizales finds his wife asleep in bed with Loaysa, and instead of blaming them he blames himself. Ashamed at the way he treated Leonora he quietly retreats and dies. Leonora decides not to marry Loaysa and instead joins a convent.

Originating in Italy during the Middle Ages, it was often based on local events; individual tales often were gathered into collections. The novella developed into a psychologically subtle and structured short tale, with writers frequently using a frame story to unify tales around a theme, as in Giovanni Boccaccio's ''Decameron''.}}</ref> written by [[Miguel de Cervantes]] between 1590 and 1612. The collection was printed in Madrid in 1613 by [[Juan de la Cuesta]], and received well in the wake of the first part of ''[[Don Quixote]]''.\n\nCervantes boasted in his foreword to have been the first to write ''novelas'' in the Spanish language:\n<blockquote>My genius and my inclination prompt me to this kind of writing; the more so as I consider (and with truth) that I am the first who has written novels in the Spanish language, though many have hitherto appeared among us, all of them translated from foreign authors. But these are my own, neither imitated nor stolen from anyone; my genius has engendered them, my pen has brought them forth, and they are growing up in the arms of the press.<ref>{{cite web  | title = E-book of The Exemplary Novels of Cervantes (Translated by Walter K. Kelly) | work = The Project Gutenberg | last = Cervantes Saavedra | first = Miguel de | url = http://www.gutenberg.org/files/14420/14420-8.txt | accessdate = 2008-11-04}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nThe novellas are usually grouped into two series: those characterized by an idealized nature and those of a realistic nature. Those idealized in nature, which are the closest to the Italian models, are characterized by plots dealing with amorous entanglements, by improbable plots, by the presence of idealized characters and psychological development, and the low reflection of reality. They include: ''[[El amante liberal]]'', ''[[Las dos doncellas]]'', ''[[La espa\u00f1ola inglesa]]'', ''[[La se\u00f1ora Cornelia]]'' and ''[[La fuerza de la sangre]]''. These were the most popular of the novellas at the time. The realistic in nature cater to the descriptions of realistic characters and environments, with intentional criticism in many cases. The realistic in nature are the best-known stories today: ''[[Rinconete y Cortadillo]]'', ''[[El licenciado Vidriera]]'', ''[[La gitanilla]]'', ''[[El casamiento enga\u00f1oso]]'' (which leads directly into the [[fantasy]] ''[[El coloquio de los perros]]''), and ''[[La ilustre fregona]]''.  However, the separation between the two groups is not sharp and elements of the idealistic may be found in some of the realistic novels.\n\nSince there are multiple versions of two of these stories, it is believed that Cervantes introduced some variations in these novels for moral, social and aesthetic purposes (hence the name 'exemplary'). The more primitive versions were found in the manuscript, now lost, called by the name of its one-time possessor, [[Porras de la C\u00e1mara]], a miscellaneous collection of various literary works which include a novel usually attributed to Cervantes, ''[[La t\u00eda fingida]]''. On the other hand, some short stories are also embedded in ''Don Quixote'', such as ''El curioso impertinente'' or ''Historia del cautivo'', and where a character possesses a manuscript of ''Rinconete y Cortadillo'', unpublished at the time (1605).\n\n==Influence and adaptations==\nCervantes' novellas inspired several English Jacobean dramas, whose authors might have read them either  in French translation or in the Spanish original.  Plays based on the novellas include Beaumont and Fletcher's ''[[Love's Pilgrimage (play)|Love's Pilgrimage]]'' (adapted from \"Las dos doncellas\"), Fletcher's ''[[The Chances]]'' (\"La Se\u00f1ora Cornelia\"), Fletcher's ''[[Rule a Wife and Have a Wife]]'' (\"El casamiento enga\u00f1oso\"), and Middleton's ''[[The Spanish Gypsy]]'' (\"La fuerza de la sangre\" and \"La gitanilla\"), among others.<ref>Wilson 37-45; Ardila, 5.</ref>\n\n==The short stories==\n*''[[La gitanilla]]''\nStory of a young man who falls in love with a gypsy. She asks him to be with her as a gypsy for two years. Later it is discovered that she is the lost daughter of the governor. He gets thrown into jail, but is later released when it's revealed that he is of knightly descent. The two marry, and live happily.\n*''[[El amante liberal]]''\nThe story of Ricardo and Leonisa. When their ship sinks, Ricardo believes that Leonisa is dead. He discovers she is alive later, when she is being sold off as a slave. The Cadi wants her for himself, surprised by her beauty and charm, thinking of getting rid of his wife so he can keep her, but Ricardo recovers her to love her properly.\n*''[[Rinconete y Cortadillo]]''\n*''[[La espa\u00f1ola inglesa]]''\nA seven-year-old girl named Isabela is kidnapped by an Englishman. She serves him as a servant, and his son falls in love with her because of her beauty. Since their love is mutual, they go to the Queen so she can approve of their union. She is impressed by Isabela's beauty and makes the boy,  prove himself worthy of her. He starts fighting off Turkish ships, and releases Spanish prisoners. He meets Isabela's parents, but keeps quiet about knowing her. Her parents meet up with her. \nRicaredo's and Isabela's wedding is interrupted by the servant's son, who fell in love with her. The Queen sends Isabela back to Spain, calling the wedding off. The servant, blinded by anger, poisons Isabela. She gets treated right in time, but the poison's side effects cause her beauty to be gone. She becomes ugly. She returns to Spain, ready to enter a convent, since Ricaredo never comes. Ricaredo is about to get married to another woman, but during a Turkish war he is wounded, and everyone believes he is dead. He returns to Spain, meets up with Isabela and marries her.\n*''[[El licenciado Vidriera]]''\n\nTom\u00e1s Rodaja, a young boy, is found by strangers, apparently abandoned. He impresses them with his wit and intelligence enough for them to take him on as a sort of adoptive son. Tom\u00e1s is sent to school, where he becomes famous for his learning; he grows up, travels all over Europe, and eventually settles in Salamanca, where he completes a degree in law.\n\nIn love with Tom\u00e1s, a young woman procures an intended love potion, with which she laces a quince that Tom\u00e1s eats. The potion does not work, instead putting Tom\u00e1s in a grave state for months (the woman flees and is never heard from again).\n\nWhen he re-emerges from convalescence Tom\u00e1s is physically restored but delusional \u2013 chiefly, Tom\u00e1s is convinced that his whole body is composed entirely of glass. His unshakable belief, combined with Tom\u00e1s' clever, memorable aphorisms in conversation with everyone he meets, make Tom\u00e1s famous throughout Spain, where he becomes known as 'Vidriera' \u2013 from the Spanish vidrio, which means 'glass'. Eventually, Tom\u00e1s is invited to court, transported in a carriage packed with hay.\n\nWith time, Tom\u00e1s recovers his sanity, only to discover to his horror throngs of people who never leave him alone, wanting to see the famous 'Vidriera'. Repulsed by fame and unable to continue as a lawyer, Tom\u00e1s joins the army as an infantryman, eventually dying in an obscure battle.\n\n*''[[La fuerza de la sangre]]''\n*''[[El celoso extreme\u00f1o]]''\n\nFilipo de Carrizales, a former soldier, who after much financial success abroad in \"las Indias\" (the term with which the author refers to America - particularly mentioning Peru), settles in Sevilla, succumbing to the desire every man has to return to his homeland; as Cervantes writes, \"tocado del natural deseo que todos tienen de volver a su patria\". He falls in love with a young and beautiful girl called Leonora. Despite being from a poor family, she comes from a noble one and he decides to love and protect her, seeing her worthy character through her poverty. He takes every precaution to protect her from the outside world and from other men, allowing no-one to pass through the second inner door, apart from the female servants or the black eunuch, this being the only male allowed into her presence. By doing this and by bringing her presents he was protecting her from the industry and the cursed humanity that could perturb her serenity, \"por ninguna v\u00eda la industria ni la malicia humana pod\u00eda perturbar su sosiego\".\n\nThis plan is foiled by a younger man, Loaysa, who manages to enter and seduce Leonora by means of a very intricate plan. In the closing moments Carrizales finds his wife asleep in bed with Loaysa, and instead of blaming them he blames himself. Ashamed at the way he treated Leonora he quietly retreats and dies. Leonora decides not to marry Loaysa and instead joins a convent. Loaysa in turn flees to \"las indias\" (the new world).\n\n*''[[La ilustre fregona]]''\n*''[[Las dos doncellas]]''\n*''[[La se\u00f1ora Cornelia]]''\n*''[[El casamiento enga\u00f1oso]]''\n*''[[El coloquio de los perros]]''\n\n==Notes==\n<references/>\n\n==References==\n* Ardila, J.A.G., ed.

He was a [[Cavaliers|Royalist]] army officer active in the West of England, during the [[English Civil War]].\n\n==Origins==\nSlanning was the son of Gamaliel Slanning of Hele, Devon, by his wife and cousin Margaret Marler, daughter of Edward Marler of Crayford, Kent. The Slanning family is first documented in 1538 and spanned nine generations until the extinction of the male line in 1700. The Slannings were  granted or acquired land in [[Bickleigh, South Hams|Bickleigh]], [[Walkhampton]], Maybury, and [[Roborough, South Hams|Roborough]], all near [[Plymouth]].\n\n==Career==\nIn 1612 he inherited the Devonshire [[manor]]s of [[Maristow]], [[Walkhampton]], and [[Bickleigh, South Hams|Bickleigh]]<ref name=Burke>[https://books.google.com/books?id=K1kBAAAAQAAJ&pg=PA597&lpg=PA597&dq=%22sir+john+davie%22&source=web&ots=E7Lt-4pk8l&sig=hjW5eem--FIWvFsFppy7RdTjTqg&hl=en#PPA489,M1 Burke's \"A genealogical and heraldic history of the extinct and dormant baronetcies\" (1838), pages 489-490 \"Slanning of Maristow\", on Google Books].</ref> all near [[Plymouth]]. He attended [[Exeter College, Oxford]] and was admitted to the [[Inner Temple]] in 1628. However, he left the next year for the [[Low Countries]] \"to learn the arts of war\".\n\n==Military activities==\nSlanning returned to England and was knighted on 24 August 1632 at [[Nonsuch Palace]].<ref>[https://archive.org/stream/knightsofengland02shawuoft#page/n209/mode/2up Knights of England]</ref> He was appointed to the Commission for Piracy in [[Devon]] and [[Cornwall]] and as [[Vice-Admiral of Cornwall|Vice-Admiral of the Southern Shores]] of both counties. He was subsequently appointed in 1635 [[Governor of Pendennis Castle]], which castle guards the entrance to [[Falmouth, Cornwall|Falmouth]] harbour, in succession to [[William Killigrew (1606\u20131695)|William Killigrew]] (1606\u20131695). During this time he was resident at Trerose in the nearby [[parish]] of [[Mawnan]].\n\nIn February 1639 Slanning embarked with 13 guns and 100 officers bound for [[Cumberland]] to take part in the abortive [[Bishops' Wars|First Bishops' War]]. It is possible that the men and guns were intended for the defence of [[Carlisle, Cumbria|Carlisle]], but Slanning headed for [[York]] to command a company in a [[Infantry|regiment of foot]] \"appointed to guard the king's person\", with the rank of Sergeant Major. He returned home following the [[Treaty of Berwick (1639)|Treaty of Berwick]] in June 1639 and by March 1640 had been appointed [[Recorder (judge)|Recorder]] of [[Plympton| Plympton St Maurice]], Devon.\n\n==Parliamentary activities==\nIn April 1640 Slanning was elected [[Member of Parliament]] for [[Plympton Erle (UK Parliament constituency)|Plympton Erle]], Devon, for the [[Short Parliament]] in what appears to be an unresolved double return.<ref name=Willis>{{Cite Notitia Parliamentaria|converted=1|part=2|pages=229\u2013239}}</ref>  Slanning was [[Lieutenant-Colonel]] of a trained band of 157 men, two-thirds [[musketeers]] and the remainder [[Pike (weapon)|pikemen]]. He and Sir [[Francis Bassett]] of [[Tehidy]] were given the responsibility for levies from the West of Cornwall for the [[Bishops' Wars|Second Bishops' War]]. After the [[Treaty of Ripon]] he hurried back to stand for [[Parliament of England|Parliament]]. \n\nIn October 1640 Slanning was elected for both Plympton Erle and [[Penryn (UK Parliament constituency)|Penryn]] to the [[Long Parliament]] (in a way which was to give rise to charges of bribery), and chose to sit for Penryn.<ref name=Willis/> His was among the 59 names of the members posted for voting against the [[Bill of Attainder]] of [[Thomas Wentworth, 1st Earl of Strafford|Strafford]]. Seven other Cornish MPs also voted against the Bill, including Godolphin, Trevanion, and [[Richard Arundell, 1st Baron Arundell of Trerice|Richard Arundell]] of [[Trerice]], who later married Slanning's widow Gertrude Bagg.\n\nIn June 1641 he returned to Cornwall to resume his governorship of [[Pendennis Castle]], but was back in London that winter, and in January 1642 was called to attend the House of Commons for sending letters to Francis Bassett in Cornwall for the arrest of the \"[[Five Members]]\", should they try to embark from a Cornish port, a charge that Slanning denied. He was still in the House in February and supplied it with information concerning \"four Scottish merchants lately arrived in Cornwall\", but probably left for Pendennis in April when many MPs withdrew. He was certainly in Cornwall when, on 9 August, he was barred from the Commons and ordered to attend the House as a \"[[delinquent (royalist)|delinquent]]\".\n\n==Civil War==\nOn 25 August 1642, the Royalist commander [[Ralph Hopton|Hopton]] entered Cornwall after separating from the Marquis of Hertford following their failed attempts to secure [[Wiltshire]], [[Dorset]], and [[Somerset]]. Hopton first visited [[Bevil Grenville|Sir Bevil Grenvile]] at [[Stowe, Kilkhampton]], then after brushing aside Bullers's Militia, headed for Pendennis on 24 September to confer with Slanning.  Hopton appeared voluntarily before the [[assizes]] at [[Truro]] and after successful defence of his actions, began recruiting. In November 1642, Slanning formed one of the five Cornish regiments foot which was known as \"the Tinners\".<ref>[[Stoyle, Mark]] (2002) ''West Britons: Cornish identities and the early modern British state'', University of Exeter Press {{ISBN|0-85989-688-9}}; pp. 205-207 (lists the officers of the regiment 1642-1646)</ref> The other regiments were formed under Colonel [[William Godolphin (Royalist)|William Godolphin]], Sir [[Bevil Grenville]], Colonel [[John Trevanion]] and [[Warwick Mohun, 2nd Baron Mohun of Okehampton]]. Slanning and the first three of these were known as the \"Wheels on Charles's [[Wain]]\". A seventeenth century [[ode]] included the [[distich]]:<br>\n:''\"Gone the four wheels of [[Charles I of England|Charles]]'s wain,<br> \n:[[Bevil Grenville|Grenville]], [[Sidney Godolphin (poet)|Godolphin]], Slanning, [[John Trevanion|Trevanion]] slain\"''<br>\n\nSlanning was released from his governorship of [[Pendennis Castle]] in 1643 and was succeeded by Sir John Arundell.\n\nHopton first used his forces to make an unsuccessful attempt on [[Exeter]] then fell back on Plympton, took it, and invested Plymouth on 1 December. Later that month they took [[Alphington, Devon|Alphington]], [[Powderham Castle|Powderham]], and [[Topsham, Devon|Topsham]] but failed to capture Exeter in a night attack. Their first field battle was [[Braddock, Cornwall|Braddock]] (actually Pinnock) Down in January 1643 when Ruthin's forces were forced to flee back through [[Liskeard]] and on to [[Saltash]], while the [[Henry Grey, 1st Earl of Stamford|Earl of Stamford]] withdrew from [[Launceston, Cornwall|Launceston]]. Slanning's regiment, along with those of Grenville and Trevanion and half of the [[Cavalry|horse]] and [[dragoons]], pursued Stamford while the rest followed up Ruthin.\n\nHopton, after some futile negotiations, invested Plymouth again and this led to Slanning's sole command in battle, but not until after the first \"wheel\" was lost when the court poet Sydney Godolphin died of a wound received in a skirmish at [[Chagford]], Devon. In February 1643 Slanning, in command of a detachment consisting of his own and Trevanion's regiments, was attacked at [[Modbury]], Devon, by [[James Chudleigh|Chudleigh]]. He was able to execute a fighting withdrawal against superior forces, but at the cost of 250 killed or wounded, 1,000 muskets and five guns.\n\nThe Cornish forces now left Devon and things remained quiet until the encounter battle of Polston Bridge, Launceston, in April, when the arrival of Slanning's and Trevanion's regiments proved decisive. Two days later there was another encounter battle, the \"Western Wonder\" of the Cavalier ballad, at Sourton Down, where in the middle of a violent thunderstorm, Chudleigh was able to hold the field and Hopton again retreated to Launceston.\n\nSlanning and his men had a brief sojourn at Saltash before rejoining the rest in a rendezvous with Grenvile's foot. They brushed aside a small force at Week St. Mary on 13 May and at 5.00 a.m. on the 16 May [[Battle of Stamford Hill|attacked the forces on Stratton (now Stamford) Hill]], [[Stratton, Cornwall|Stratton]]. This produced their most spectacular victory when, after ten hours of fighting uphill against twice their number of much better equipped enemy with a dug-in [[Artillery battery|battery]], the Royalists gained the position, killing 300 and capturing 1,700 with fourteen guns, \u00a3300 and plentiful provisions, at a cost of 80 men. Slanning and Trevanion commanded the westernmost of the four columns.\n\nThe Cornish Royalist army then received orders to rendezvous with [[Prince Maurice von Simmern|Prince Maurice's]] men, whom they met at [[Chard, Somerset|Chard]] in Somerset in June. This combined force now took [[Taunton]], [[Bridgwater]], [[Dunster Castle]] and [[Wells, Somerset|Wells]]. Their first contact with the Parliamentarian commander [[William Waller]] was a [[cavalry]] skirmish at [[Chewton Mendip]]. Waller was driven out of [[Monkton Farleigh]] on 3 July 1643 and on 5 July, two days later, the Royalists won a  [[pyrrhic victory]] at the [[Battle of Lansdowne]]. Slanning was described as \"advancing from hedge to hedge at the head of his men, in the mouths of muskets and cannons, insomuch they thought him immortal, as indeed he was that day\"<ref name=Burke/> whereas Sir Bevill Grenvile, the next \"wheel\", fell at the battle. The foot were now besieged in [[Devizes]] but witnessed the destruction of Waller's forces at [[Battle of Roundway Down|Roundway Down]].\n\n==Storming of Bristol and death==\nThe Western Royalists took [[Bath, Somerset|Bath]], and after joining [[Prince Rupert of the Rhine|Prince Rupert]] on 26 July 1643 they stormed [[Bristol]]. Slanning commanded one of the three tertia of the Western Army which attacked the South Eastern defences at 3.00 a.m. Bristol fell after some thirteen hours fighting,  Slanning and Trevanion were both mortally wounded. Slanning's leg was broken by a musket ball, and he died a few days later,<ref>Date of death stated as \"a few days after\" the day of the battle by ODNB.</ref> quipping \"that he had always despised bullets, having been so used to them, and almost thought they could not hurt him\", and professing \"great joy and satisfaction in the losing of his life in the King's service to whom he had always dedicated it\".\n\nNo record remains of where Sir Nicholas Slanning was buried. The Sir Nicholas Slanning buried at St Mary the Virgin at [[Bickleigh, South Hams|Bickleigh]], Devon was this Sir Nicholas's grandfather, but Slanning's body may have been returned there for burial since some of his arms reached Bickleigh and his funerary helmet and gauntlet may still be seen, by arrangement, at the church.\n\n==Marriage & progeny==\nIn 1625 Slanning married Gertrude Bagge, a daughter of Sir [[James Bagge]] of [[Saltram House|Saltram]],<ref>\"Little Saltram\", per [[John Prince (biographer)|Prince, John]], (1643\u20131723) The Worthies of Devon, 1810 edition, London, p. 716, note 2</ref> in the parish of [[Plympton]], Devon. She survived him and remarried to [[Richard Arundell, 1st Baron Arundell of Trerice]]. By his wife Slanning had two sons and two daughters, including:\n*[[Sir Nicholas Slanning, 1st Baronet]] (1643\u20131691), granted a [[Slanning Baronets|baronetcy]] by the restored King Charles II.<ref name=Burke/>\n*Elizabeth (died 1724), who married Sir James Modyford, 1st Baronet,  Deputy [[Governor of Jamaica]] and had issue: her descendants were to inherit the Slanning estates after  her brother's  line died out.\n*Margaret, who married Sir John Molesworth, but had no children.\n\nThe younger Sir Nicholas left one son and heir,  Sir Andrew Slanning, 2nd Baronet. Andrew was [[murdered]] by John Cowland  after a drunken brawl in  a [[Convent Garden]]  [[tavern]] in 1700.  He was the last of the Slannings: his estates passed to the heirs of his aunt Lady Modyford.\n\n==Modern commemoration==\nThe name of Sir Nicholas Slanning and his men lives on in the guise of \"Sir Nicholas Slanning his regiment of foote\", a part of [[The Sealed Knot (reenactment)|The Sealed Knot]].\n\n==See also==\n*[[Cornwall in the English Civil War]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://www.slannings.co.uk Civil War Re-enactment group: Slanning's Regiment]\n* [http://www.thesealedknot.org.uk Sealed Knot: national historical re-enactment organisation]\n* [[ODNB]] article by  Mary Wolffe, \u2018Slanning, Sir Nicholas (1606\u20131643)\u2019, ''Oxford Dictionary of National Biography'', Oxford University Press, 2004 [http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/25714], accessed 5 Dec 2007.\n\n{{s-start}}\n{{s-par|en}}\n{{succession box \n| title=[[Member of Parliament]] for [[Plympton Erle (UK Parliament constituency)|Plympton Erle]] \n| before= ''Parliament suspended since 1629''\n| with= [[Richard Strode (died 1669)|Richard Strode]]\n| with2= [[Sir Thomas Hele, 1st Baronet]]\n| with3= [[Michael Oldisworth]]\n| years=1640 (April)\n| after= [[Sir Thomas Hele, 1st Baronet]]\n| after2= [[Hugh Potter]]\n}}\n{{succession box \n| title=[[Member of Parliament]] for [[Penryn (UK Parliament constituency)|Penryn]]  \n| before=  [[Sir Richard Vyvyan, 1st Baronet]]\n| before2= [[Joseph Hall (MP)|Joseph Hall]] \n| with=  [[Sir John Bampfylde, 1st Baronet|John Bampfylde]]\n| years=1640\u20131642\n| after=  [[Sir John Bampfylde, 1st Baronet|John Bampfylde]]\n| after2= ''other seat vacant''\n}}\n{{s-end}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Slanning, Nicholas}}\n[[Category:1606 births]]\n[[Category:1643 deaths]]\n[[Category:People killed in the English Civil War]]\n[[Category:Cavaliers]]\n[[Category:Members of the Inner Temple]]\n[[Category:Military history of Cornwall]]\n[[Category:Alumni of Exeter College, Oxford]]\n[[Category:Members of the pre-1707 English Parliament for constituencies in Cornwall]]\n[[Category:English MPs 1640 (April)]]\n[[Category:English MPs 1640\u20131648]]\n", "text_old": "{{otherpeople}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=March 2017}}\n{{Use British English|date=March 2017}}\n[[File:SlanningArms.png|thumb|200px|Arms of Slanning: ''Argent, two pales engrailed gules over all on a bend azure three griffin's heads or'']]\n'''Sir Nicholas Slanning''' (1 September 1606 \u2013 July/August 1643)<ref>Date of birth and death given by [[ODNB]] article by  Mary Wolffe, \u2018Slanning, Sir Nicholas (1606\u20131643)\u2019, ''Oxford Dictionary of National Biography'', Oxford University Press, 2004 [http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/25714], (accessed 5 Dec 2007) :\"26 July 1643; he was mortally wounded and died a few days later\".</ref> was an English soldier and politician who sat in the [[House of Commons of England|House of Commons]]  from 1640 to 1642.

THe Slannings were  granted or acquired land in [[Bickleigh, South Hams|Bickleigh]], [[Walkhampton]], Maybury, and [[Roborough, South Hams|Roborough]], all near [[Plymouth]].\n\n==Career==\nIn 1612 he inherited the Devonshire [[manor]]s of [[Maristow]], [[Walkhampton]], and [[Bickleigh, South Hams|Bickleigh]]<ref name=Burke>[https://books.google.com/books?id=K1kBAAAAQAAJ&pg=PA597&lpg=PA597&dq=%22sir+john+davie%22&source=web&ots=E7Lt-4pk8l&sig=hjW5eem--FIWvFsFppy7RdTjTqg&hl=en#PPA489,M1 Burke's \"A genealogical and heraldic history of the extinct and dormant baronetcies\" (1838), pages 489-490 \"Slanning of Maristow\", on Google Books].</ref> all near [[Plymouth]]. He attended [[Exeter College, Oxford]] and was admitted to the [[Inner Temple]] in 1628. However, he left the next year for the [[Low Countries]] \"to learn the arts of war\".\n\n==Military activities==\nSlanning returned to England and was knighted on 24 August 1632 at [[Nonsuch Palace]].<ref>[https://archive.org/stream/knightsofengland02shawuoft#page/n209/mode/2up Knights of England]</ref> He was appointed to the Commission for Piracy in [[Devon]] and [[Cornwall]] and as [[Vice-Admiral of Cornwall|Vice-Admiral of the Southern Shores]] of both counties. He was subsequently appointed in 1635 [[Governor of Pendennis Castle]], which castle guards the entrance to [[Falmouth, Cornwall|Falmouth]] harbour, in succession to [[William Killigrew (1606\u20131695)|William Killigrew]] (1606\u20131695). During this time he was resident at Trerose in the nearby [[parish]] of [[Mawnan]].\n\nIn February 1639 Slanning embarked with 13 guns and 100 officers bound for [[Cumberland]] to take part in the abortive [[Bishops' Wars|First Bishops' War]]. It is possible that the men and guns were intended for the defence of [[Carlisle, Cumbria|Carlisle]], but Slanning headed for [[York]] to command a company in a [[Infantry|regiment of foot]] \"appointed to guard the king's person\", with the rank of Sergeant Major. He returned home following the [[Treaty of Berwick (1639)|Treaty of Berwick]] in June 1639 and by March 1640 had been appointed [[Recorder (judge)|Recorder]] of [[Plympton| Plympton St Maurice]], Devon.\n\n==Parliamentary activities==\nIn April 1640 Slanning was elected [[Member of Parliament]] for [[Plympton Erle (UK Parliament constituency)|Plympton Erle]], Devon, for the [[Short Parliament]] in what appears to be an unresolved double return.<ref name=Willis>{{Cite Notitia Parliamentaria|converted=1|part=2|pages=229\u2013239}}</ref>  Slanning was [[Lieutenant-Colonel]] of a trained band of 157 men, two-thirds [[musketeers]] and the remainder [[Pike (weapon)|pikemen]]. He and Sir [[Francis Bassett]] of [[Tehidy]] were given the responsibility for levies from the West of Cornwall for the [[Bishops' Wars|Second Bishops' War]]. After the [[Treaty of Ripon]] he hurried back to stand for [[Parliament of England|Parliament]]. \n\nIn October 1640 Slanning was elected for both Plympton Erle and [[Penryn (UK Parliament constituency)|Penryn]] to the [[Long Parliament]] (in a way which was to give rise to charges of bribery), and chose to sit for Penryn.<ref name=Willis/> His was among the 59 names of the members posted for voting against the [[Bill of Attainder]] of [[Thomas Wentworth, 1st Earl of Strafford|Strafford]]. Seven other Cornish MPs also voted against the Bill, including Godolphin, Trevanion, and [[Richard Arundell, 1st Baron Arundell of Trerice|Richard Arundell]] of [[Trerice]], who later married Slanning's widow Gertrude Bagg.\n\nIn June 1641 he returned to Cornwall to resume his governorship of [[Pendennis Castle]], but was back in London that winter, and in January 1642 was called to attend the House of Commons for sending letters to Francis Bassett in Cornwall for the arrest of the \"[[Five Members]]\", should they try to embark from a Cornish port, a charge that Slanning denied. He was still in the House in February and supplied it with information concerning \"four Scottish merchants lately arrived in Cornwall\", but probably left for Pendennis in April when many MPs withdrew. He was certainly in Cornwall when, on 9 August, he was barred from the Commons and ordered to attend the House as a \"[[delinquent (royalist)|delinquent]]\".\n\n==Civil War==\nOn 25 August 1642, the Royalist commander [[Ralph Hopton|Hopton]] entered Cornwall after separating from the Marquis of Hertford following their failed attempts to secure [[Wiltshire]], [[Dorset]], and [[Somerset]]. Hopton first visited [[Bevil Grenville|Sir Bevil Grenvile]] at [[Stowe, Kilkhampton]], then after brushing aside Bullers's Militia, headed for Pendennis on 24 September to confer with Slanning.  Hopton appeared voluntarily before the [[assizes]] at [[Truro]] and after successful defence of his actions, began recruiting. In November 1642, Slanning formed one of the five Cornish regiments foot which was known as \"the Tinners\".<ref>[[Stoyle, Mark]] (2002) ''West Britons: Cornish identities and the early modern British state'', University of Exeter Press {{ISBN|0-85989-688-9}}; pp. 205-207 (lists the officers of the regiment 1642-1646)</ref> The other regiments were formed under Colonel [[William Godolphin (Royalist)|William Godolphin]], Sir [[Bevil Grenville]], Colonel [[John Trevanion]] and [[Warwick Mohun, 2nd Baron Mohun of Okehampton]]. Slanning and the first three of these were known as the \"Wheels on Charles's [[Wain]]\". A seventeenth century [[ode]] included the [[distich]]:<br>\n:''\"Gone the four wheels of [[Charles I of England|Charles]]'s wain,<br> \n:[[Bevil Grenville|Grenville]], [[Sidney Godolphin (poet)|Godolphin]], Slanning, [[John Trevanion|Trevanion]] slain\"''<br>\n\nSlanning was released from his governorship of [[Pendennis Castle]] in 1643 and was succeeded by Sir John Arundell.\n\nHopton first used his forces to make an unsuccessful attempt on [[Exeter]] then fell back on Plympton, took it, and invested Plymouth on 1 December. Later that month they took [[Alphington, Devon|Alphington]], [[Powderham Castle|Powderham]], and [[Topsham, Devon|Topsham]] but failed to capture Exeter in a night attack. Their first field battle was [[Braddock, Cornwall|Braddock]] (actually Pinnock) Down in January 1643 when Ruthin's forces were forced to flee back through [[Liskeard]] and on to [[Saltash]], while the [[Henry Grey, 1st Earl of Stamford|Earl of Stamford]] withdrew from [[Launceston, Cornwall|Launceston]]. Slanning's regiment, along with those of Grenville and Trevanion and half of the [[Cavalry|horse]] and [[dragoons]], pursued Stamford while the rest followed up Ruthin.\n\nHopton, after some futile negotiations, invested Plymouth again and this led to Slanning's sole command in battle, but not until after the first \"wheel\" was lost when the court poet Sydney Godolphin died of a wound received in a skirmish at [[Chagford]], Devon. In February 1643 Slanning, in command of a detachment consisting of his own and Trevanion's regiments, was attacked at [[Modbury]], Devon, by [[James Chudleigh|Chudleigh]]. He was able to execute a fighting withdrawal against superior forces, but at the cost of 250 killed or wounded, 1,000 muskets and five guns.\n\nThe Cornish forces now left Devon and things remained quiet until the encounter battle of Polston Bridge, Launceston, in April, when the arrival of Slanning's and Trevanion's regiments proved decisive. Two days later there was another encounter battle, the \"Western Wonder\" of the Cavalier ballad, at Sourton Down, where in the middle of a violent thunderstorm, Chudleigh was able to hold the field and Hopton again retreated to Launceston.\n\nSlanning and his men had a brief sojourn at Saltash before rejoining the rest in a rendezvous with Grenvile's foot. They brushed aside a small force at Week St. Mary on 13 May and at 5.00 a.m. on the 16 May [[Battle of Stamford Hill|attacked the forces on Stratton (now Stamford) Hill]], [[Stratton, Cornwall|Stratton]]. This produced their most spectacular victory when, after ten hours of fighting uphill against twice their number of much better equipped enemy with a dug-in [[Artillery battery|battery]], the Royalists gained the position, killing 300 and capturing 1,700 with fourteen guns, \u00a3300 and plentiful provisions, at a cost of 80 men. Slanning and Trevanion commanded the westernmost of the four columns.\n\nThe Cornish Royalist army then received orders to rendezvous with [[Prince Maurice von Simmern|Prince Maurice's]] men, whom they met at [[Chard, Somerset|Chard]] in Somerset in June. This combined force now took [[Taunton]], [[Bridgwater]], [[Dunster Castle]] and [[Wells, Somerset|Wells]]. Their first contact with the Parliamentarian commander [[William Waller]] was a [[cavalry]] skirmish at [[Chewton Mendip]]. Waller was driven out of [[Monkton Farleigh]] on 3 July 1643 and on 5 July, two days later, the Royalists won a  [[pyrrhic victory]] at the [[Battle of Lansdowne]]. Slanning was described as \"advancing from hedge to hedge at the head of his men, in the mouths of muskets and cannons, insomuch they thought him immortal, as indeed he was that day\"<ref name=Burke/> whereas Sir Bevill Grenvile, the next \"wheel\", fell at the battle. The foot were now besieged in [[Devizes]] but witnessed the destruction of Waller's forces at [[Battle of Roundway Down|Roundway Down]].\n\n==Storming of Bristol and death==\nThe Western Royalists took [[Bath, Somerset|Bath]], and after joining [[Prince Rupert of the Rhine|Prince Rupert]] on 26 July 1643 they stormed [[Bristol]]. Slanning commanded one of the three tertia of the Western Army which attacked the South Eastern defences at 3.00 a.m. Bristol fell after some thirteen hours fighting,  Slanning and Trevanion were both mortally wounded. Slanning's leg was broken by a musket ball, and he died a few days later,<ref>Date of death stated as \"a few days after\" the day of the battle by ODNB.</ref> quipping \"that he had always despised bullets, having been so used to them, and almost thought they could not hurt him\", and professing \"great joy and satisfaction in the losing of his life in the King's service to whom he had always dedicated it\".\n\nNo record remains of where Sir Nicholas Slanning was buried. The Sir Nicholas Slanning buried at St Mary the Virgin at [[Bickleigh, South Hams|Bickleigh]], Devon was this Sir Nicholas's grandfather, but Slanning's body may have been returned there for burial since some of his arms reached Bickleigh and his funerary helmet and gauntlet may still be seen, by arrangement, at the church.\n\n==Marriage & progeny==\nIn 1625 Slanning married Gertrude Bagge, a daughter of Sir [[James Bagge]] of [[Saltram House|Saltram]],<ref>\"Little Saltram\", per [[John Prince (biographer)|Prince, John]], (1643\u20131723) The Worthies of Devon, 1810 edition, London, p. 716, note 2</ref> in the parish of [[Plympton]], Devon. She survived him and re-married to [[Richard Arundell, 1st Baron Arundell of Trerice]]. By his wife Slanning had two sons and two daughters, including:\n*[[Sir Nicholas Slanning, 1st Baronet]] (1643\u20131691), granted a [[Slanning Baronets|baronetcy]] by the restored King Charles II.<ref name=Burke/>\n*Elizabeth (died 1724), who married Sir James Modyford, 1st Baronet,  Deputy [[Governor of Jamaica]] and had issue: her descendants were to inherit the Slanning estates after  her brother's  line died out.\n*Margaret, who married Sir John Molesworth, but had no children.\n\nThe younger Sir Nicholas left one son and heir,  Sir Andrew Slanning, 2nd Baronet. Andrew was [[murdered]] by John Cowland  after a drunken brawl in  a [[Convent Garden]]  [[tavern]] in 1700.  He was the last of the Slannings: his estates passed to the heirs of his aunt Lady Modyford.\n\n==Modern commemoration==\nThe name of Sir Nicholas Slanning and his men lives on in the guise of \"Sir Nicholas Slanning his regiment of foote\", a part of [[The Sealed Knot (reenactment)|The Sealed Knot]].\n\n==See also==\n*[[Cornwall in the English Civil War]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://www.slannings.co.uk Civil War Re-enactment group: Slanning's Regiment]\n* [http://www.thesealedknot.org.uk Sealed Knot: national historical re-enactment organisation]\n* [[ODNB]] article by  Mary Wolffe, \u2018Slanning, Sir Nicholas (1606\u20131643)\u2019, ''Oxford Dictionary of National Biography'', Oxford University Press, 2004 [http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/25714], accessed 5 Dec 2007.\n\n{{s-start}}\n{{s-par|en}}\n{{succession box \n| title=[[Member of Parliament]] for [[Plympton Erle (UK Parliament constituency)|Plympton Erle]] \n| before= ''Parliament suspended since 1629''\n| with= [[Richard Strode (died 1669)|Richard Strode]]\n| with2= [[Sir Thomas Hele, 1st Baronet]]\n| with3= [[Michael Oldisworth]]\n| years=1640 (April)\n| after= [[Sir Thomas Hele, 1st Baronet]]\n| after2= [[Hugh Potter]]\n}}\n{{succession box \n| title=[[Member of Parliament]] for [[Penryn (UK Parliament constituency)|Penryn]]  \n| before=  [[Sir Richard Vyvyan, 1st Baronet]]\n| before2= [[Joseph Hall (MP)|Joseph Hall]] \n| with=  [[Sir John Bampfylde, 1st Baronet|John Bampfylde]]\n| years=1640\u20131642\n| after=  [[Sir John Bampfylde, 1st Baronet|John Bampfylde]]\n| after2= ''other seat vacant''\n}}\n{{s-end}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Slanning, Nicholas}}\n[[Category:1606 births]]\n[[Category:1643 deaths]]\n[[Category:People killed in the English Civil War]]\n[[Category:Cavaliers]]\n[[Category:Members of the Inner Temple]]\n[[Category:Military history of Cornwall]]\n[[Category:Alumni of Exeter College, Oxford]]\n[[Category:Members of the pre-1707 English Parliament for constituencies in Cornwall]]\n[[Category:English MPs 1640 (April)]]\n[[Category:English MPs 1640\u20131648]]\n", "name_user": "J947", "label": "safe", "comment": "clean up,typo(s) fixed: THe \u2192 The, re-married \u2192 remarried", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicholas_Slanning"}
