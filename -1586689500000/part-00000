On July 15, during a tag team match [[2 Cold Scorpio]] and [[Dean Malenko]] delivered a [[Professional wrestling double-team maneuvers#Aided piledriver|spike piledriver]] to him, and though he knew it was about to be performed, he did not have time to properly protect himself. As he explained on the DVD documentary ''[[The Rise and Fall of ECW]]'', \"I landed right on my forehead and just jacked my whole neck back and that was it.\" The neck injury was so bad that, according to [[Tommy Dreamer]], hospital staff couldn't believe he'd walked into the hospital where he sought help after the match. Though he was unable to wrestle, Paul Heyman continued to pay him per their oral agreement, forging a loyalty between the men.<ref name=\"Houseofhardcore\"/>\n\n==== Rise to superstardom (1995\u20131996) ====\nFollowing his neck injury, Taz made appearances with [[The Steiner Brothers]], even standing in their corner during matches with [[The Eliminators]] and getting physical with [[Jason Knight|Jason]]. It was at the [[November to Remember (1995)|November to Remember]] event, when Taz turned heel and joined up with referee [[Bill Alfonso]]. Working as the special referee for Alfonso's match with ECW commissioner [[Tod Gordon]], Taz refused to count to three and assaulted Gordon, then making the count for Alfonso. In his post-match promo, he claimed that no one was looking after him while he was injured and that no one cared (though Heyman was still paying him, the [[kayfabe]] story was that he had been forgotten and that Alfonso was the one helping him keep food on his family's table). He was also angry that Sabu was brought back in that very night.\n\nTaz returned to the ring on December 19, 1995 at Holiday Hell with a new look and wrestling style. The new character had him clad in a black/orange [[wiktionary:singlet|singlet]] and exhibiting a more physically intense in-ring style, focusing his offense on mat wrestling and [[suplex]]es (inspired by working with The Steiner Brothers), which announcer [[Joey Styles]] dubbed ''[[#In wrestling|Taz-Plexes]]'', earning him the nickname \"The Human Suplex Machine\". He also debuted his ''[[Professional wrestling holds#Half nelson choke|Tazmission]]''/Katahajime finishing maneuver, causing opponents to [[Submission (combat sport)|tap out]] to signal their submission as in [[mixed martial arts]] instead of nodding their head or vocally saying \"yes\". This quirk was soon picked up by other companies throughout the country.<ref>{{cite episode|title=12/17/95|series=History of ECW|network=[[WWE Classics On Demand]]| airdate=2007-08-14}}</ref> Heading into the summer, Taz began feuding with Tommy Dreamer, joining up with [[Brian Lee (wrestler)|Brian Lee]] to face Dreamer and [[Terry Gordy]] and later Dreamer and [[\"Dr. Death\" Steve Williams]]. Taz also developed a friendship with The Eliminators, based on mutual respect, and they occasionally involved themselves in his matches. [[Perry Saturn]] and Taz were both trainers at ECW's [[House of Hardcore]] wrestling school. For a while, some of the students, including Mako and [[Chris Chetti]], would accompany Taz and Alfonso to the ring as a faction known as Team Taz.<ref name=\"Houseofhardcore\"/>\n\nAt [[November to Remember (1996)|November to Remember]], things seemed to come full circle, as Taz stormed to the ring and interrupted Styles and \"stole Paul E.'s thunder\" by announcing that there would be a \"big show in the first quarter of the new year\", basically telling the fans in attendance that ECW's first [[pay-per-view]] was on the horizon. At that \"big show\", he guaranteed that Sabu would finally face him. Later that night, he came out to force Scorpio to leave the ring and went on an angry tirade, abusing Bob Artese and holding him hostage in the ring. Taz demanded Sabu come out and face him, and twice even led the crowd in a \"Sabu, Sabu\" chant to get him to enter the ring.  Several officials and wrestlers came out and Taz eventually got his hands on Paul E. The lights went out and when they came back on, Sabu was in the ring, across from Taz. This was the first time they had been in the ring together since early 1995. Before they could lock up, the lights went out again.\n\nDuring Sabu's match, where he teamed with [[Rob Van Dam]] to face The Eliminators and [[The Gangstas]] in a three-way dance, Taz attempted to attack his former partner, but Van Dam saved Sabu and was choked out in the aisle. This distraction caused Sabu to get hit with ''Total Elimination'' and his team lost. Taz also began a mini-feud with Rob Van Dam, dominating him in every match and was also out for a short time to get surgery on his injured shoulder. As 1996 ended and 1997 began, Taz and Sabu continued to try getting at one another, with no actual contact.\n\n==== World Television Champion (1997\u20131998) ====\nEarly in 1997, the antagonism between Sabu and Taz was growing, as Taz attacked Sabu's partner, Rob Van Dam, costing the team matches with The Eliminators and other teams. In the months leading to ECW's [[ECW Barely Legal|first pay-per-view]], Taz would choke out low-level wrestlers with the ''Tazmission'' due to viewing his matches as secondary to his rivalry with Sabu. He then dominated another series of matches with Van Dam before meeting Sabu at [[ECW Barely Legal|Barely Legal]], where Taz defeated him with the ''Tazmission'',<ref>{{cite web|url=http://prowrestlinghistory.com/ecw/results/1997b.html#041397|title=Barely Legal 1997 results| accessdate=July 22, 2007|publisher=Pro Wrestling History}}</ref> only to have his [[Manager (professional wrestling)|manager]] [[Bill Alfonso]] [[Glossary of professional wrestling terms#Turn|turn]] on him and join Sabu and his partner [[Rob Van Dam]].<ref name=\"slambio\"/> In response, Taz began teaming with [[Chris Candido]] to face Sabu and Van Dam.\n\nTwo months later at [[Wrestlepalooza (1997)|Wrestlepalooza]], Taz lost to Sabu in the rematch, marking his first loss since 1995. However, later in the night, he won the World Television Championship from [[Shane Douglas]] to begin his second reign.<ref name=\"WT-ECWTV\"/> He defended the title against all comers, including Douglas, [[Lance Storm]], [[John Kronus]], [[Al Snow]], [[Jerry Lynn]] and [[Chris Candido]]. Throughout late 1997, Taz began feuding with The Triple Threat in addition to Sabu and Van Dam, where he sometimes teamed up with [[Tommy Dreamer]] during the feud. At [[November to Remember (1997)|November to Remember]], he issued a challenge to World Heavyweight Champion Bam Bam Bigelow. The two would eventually meet, after Bigelow turned on Taz in a match against Shane Douglas and Chris Candido. Taz would ultimately lose the title to [[Bam Bam Bigelow]] at [[Living Dangerously (1998)|Living Dangerously]] on March 1, 1998.\n\nAfter losing the World Television Championship, Taz was elevated into the World Heavyweight Championship picture. In May 1998, with Shane Douglas injured and unable to wrestle, Taz was given an old World Television Championship belt painted orange\u2014his trademark color\u2014and began [[Glossary of professional wrestling terms#Promo|cutting promos]], declaring himself the [[ECW FTW Heavyweight Championship|FTW Heavyweight Champion]] at [[It Ain't Seinfeld]].

He would then begin a feud with Sabu over Taz's World Heavyweight Championship and Sabu's FTW Heavyweight Championship. The rivalry culminated in a title unification match at the [[Living Dangerously (1999)|Living Dangerously]] pay-per-view, where Taz defeated Sabu to unify the FTW Heavyweight Championship into the World Heavyweight Championship. He would begin his next rivalry with Chris Candido, whom he defeated to retain the title at [[CyberSlam (1999)|CyberSlam]]. The two were scheduled to a rematch at [[Hardcore Heaven (1999)|Hardcore Heaven]], which Taz quickly won. However, he was attacked by [[Dudley Boyz]] after the match, leading to a title defense against [[Bubba Ray Dudley|Buh Buh Ray Dudley]] in a [[Professional wrestling match types#Falls Count Anywhere match|falls count anywhere match]] in the main event later that night, which Taz won to retain the title. Taz then successfully defended the title against Candido on the June 4 episode of ''Hardcore TV'' to end the rivalry.\n\nTaz made his next successful title defense against [[Spike Dudley]] in a Falls Count Anywhere match on the June 25 episode of ''Hardcore TV''. He would begin feuding with the members of [[Steve Corino]]'s [[The Network (professional wrestling)|new rising stable]], primarily [[Yoshihiro Tajiri]]. Taz successfully defended the World Heavyweight Championship against Tajiri at [[Hostile City Showdown (1999)|Hostile City Showdown]], the [[Heat Wave (1999)|Heat Wave]] pay-per-view and the September 3 episode of ''[[ECW on TNN]]''.

As he walked out of the ring, a large portion of the ECW locker room joined him on the entrance ramp to give him an emotional sendoff.

Appearing as The Tazmaniac, he then made his only appearance ever in [[World Championship Wrestling]] (WCW) when he defeated [[Joey Maggs]] in a dark match at a ''[[WCW Saturday Night|Saturday Night]]'' taping in [[Atlanta, Georgia]] on February 8, 1993.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thehistoryofwwe.com/wcw93.htm |title=WCW 1993 |publisher=Thehistoryofwwe.com |date= |accessdate=2018-07-22}}</ref> He would then make his second appearance in the WWF on May 5, 1993.

He held the title once more, this time with [[Sabu (wrestler)|Sabu]], until Sabu was [[Legit (professional wrestling)|legitimately]] fired by ECW owner [[Paul Heyman]] for [[No-show (professional wrestling)|no-showing]] an event in favor of touring Japan for [[New Japan Pro Wrestling]].<ref name=\"Houseofhardcore\">{{cite video|date=November 16, 2004|title=[[The Rise and Fall of ECW|Rise and Fall of ECW, The]]|medium=DVD|publisher=[[WWE Home Video]]}}</ref> In August 1994, The Tazmaniac competed in a [[NWA World Title Tournament|one-night eight-man tournament]] for the vacant [[NWA World Heavyweight Championship]], losing to [[Shane Douglas]] in the quarter-finals.<ref name=\"Williams2013\">{{cite book|author=Scott E.

On July 15, during a tag team match [[2 Cold Scorpio]] and [[Dean Malenko]] delivered a [[Professional wrestling double-team maneuvers#Aided piledriver|spike piledriver]] to him, and though he knew it was about to be performed, he did not have time to properly protect himself. As he explained on the DVD documentary ''[[The Rise and Fall of ECW]]'', \"I landed right on my forehead and just jacked my whole neck back and that was it.\" The neck injury was so bad that, according to [[Tommy Dreamer]], hospital staff couldn't believe he'd walked into the hospital where he sought help after the match. Though he was unable to wrestle, Paul Heyman continued to pay him per their oral agreement, forging a loyalty between the men.<ref name=\"Houseofhardcore\"/>\n\n==== Rise to superstardom (1995\u20131996) ====\nFollowing his neck injury, Taz made appearances with [[The Steiner Brothers]], even standing in their corner during matches with [[The Eliminators]] and getting physical with [[Jason Knight|Jason]]. It was at the [[November to Remember (1995)|November to Remember]] event, when Taz turned heel and joined up with referee [[Bill Alfonso]]. Working as the special referee for Alfonso's match with ECW commissioner [[Tod Gordon]], Taz refused to count to three and assaulted Gordon, then making the count for Alfonso. In his post-match promo, he claimed that no one was looking after him while he was injured and that no one cared (though Heyman was still paying him, the [[kayfabe]] story was that he had been forgotten and that Alfonso was the one helping him keep food on his family's table). He was also angry that Sabu was brought back in that very night.\n\nTaz returned to the ring on December 19, 1995 at Holiday Hell with a new look and wrestling style. The new character had him clad in a black/orange [[wiktionary:singlet|singlet]] and exhibiting a more physically intense in-ring style, focusing his offense on mat wrestling and [[suplex]]es (inspired by working with The Steiner Brothers), which announcer [[Joey Styles]] dubbed ''[[#In wrestling|Taz-Plexes]]'', earning him the nickname \"The Human Suplex Machine\". He also debuted his ''[[Professional wrestling holds#Half nelson choke|Tazmission]]''/Katahajime finishing maneuver, causing opponents to [[Submission (combat sport)|tap out]] to signal their submission as in [[mixed martial arts]] instead of nodding their head or vocally saying \"yes\". This quirk was soon picked up by other companies throughout the country.<ref>{{cite episode|title=12/17/95|series=History of ECW|network=[[WWE Classics On Demand]]| airdate=2007-08-14}}</ref> Heading into the summer, Taz began feuding with Tommy Dreamer, joining up with [[Brian Lee (wrestler)|Brian Lee]] to face Dreamer and [[Terry Gordy]] and later Dreamer and [[\"Dr. Death\" Steve Williams]]. Taz also developed a friendship with The Eliminators, based on mutual respect, and they occasionally involved themselves in his matches. [[Perry Saturn]] and Taz were both trainers at ECW's [[House of Hardcore]] wrestling school. For a while, some of the students, including Mako and [[Chris Chetti]], would accompany Taz and Alfonso to the ring as a faction known as Team Taz.<ref name=\"Houseofhardcore\"/>\n\nAt [[November to Remember (1996)|November to Remember]], things seemed to come full circle, as Taz stormed to the ring and interrupted Styles and \"stole Paul E.'s thunder\" by announcing that there would be a \"big show in the first quarter of the new year\", basically telling the fans in attendance that ECW's first [[pay-per-view]] was on the horizon. At that \"big show\", he guaranteed that Sabu would finally face him. Later that night, he came out to force Scorpio to leave the ring and went on an angry tirade, abusing Bob Artese and holding him hostage in the ring. Taz demanded Sabu come out and face him, and twice even led the crowd in a \"Sabu, Sabu\" chant to get him to enter the ring.  Several officials and wrestlers came out and Taz eventually got his hands on Paul E. The lights went out and when they came back on, Sabu was in the ring, across from Taz. This was the first time they had been in the ring together since early 1995. Before they could lock up, the lights went out again.\n\nDuring Sabu's match, where he teamed with [[Rob Van Dam]] to face The Eliminators and [[The Gangstas]] in a three-way dance, Taz attempted to attack his former partner, but Van Dam saved Sabu and was choked out in the aisle. This distraction caused Sabu to get hit with ''Total Elimination'' and his team lost. Taz also began a mini-feud with Rob Van Dam, dominating him in every match and was also out for a short time to get surgery on his injured shoulder. As 1996 ended and 1997 began, Taz and Sabu continued to try getting at one another, with no actual contact.\n\n==== World Television Champion (1997\u20131998) ====\nEarly in 1997, the antagonism between Sabu and Taz was growing, as Taz attacked Sabu's partner, Rob Van Dam, costing the team matches with The Eliminators and other teams. In the months leading to ECW's [[ECW Barely Legal|first pay-per-view]], Taz would choke out low-level wrestlers with the ''Tazmission'' due to viewing his matches as secondary to his rivalry with Sabu. He then dominated another series of matches with Van Dam before meeting Sabu at [[ECW Barely Legal|Barely Legal]], where Taz defeated him with the ''Tazmission'',<ref>{{cite web|url=http://prowrestlinghistory.com/ecw/results/1997b.html#041397|title=Barely Legal 1997 results| accessdate=July 22, 2007|publisher=Pro Wrestling History}}</ref> only to have his [[Manager (professional wrestling)|manager]] [[Bill Alfonso]] [[Glossary of professional wrestling terms#Turn|turn]] on him and join Sabu and his partner [[Rob Van Dam]].<ref name=\"slambio\"/> In response, Taz began teaming with [[Chris Candido]] to face Sabu and Van Dam.\n\nTwo months later at [[Wrestlepalooza (1997)|Wrestlepalooza]], Taz lost to Sabu in the rematch, marking his first loss since 1995. However, later in the night, he won the World Television Championship from [[Shane Douglas]] to begin his second reign.<ref name=\"WT-ECWTV\"/> He defended the title against all comers, including Douglas, [[Lance Storm]], [[John Kronus]], [[Al Snow]], [[Jerry Lynn]] and [[Chris Candido]]. Throughout late 1997, Taz began feuding with The Triple Threat in addition to Sabu and Van Dam, where he sometimes teamed up with [[Tommy Dreamer]] during the feud. At [[November to Remember (1997)|November to Remember]], he issued a challenge to World Heavyweight Champion Bam Bam Bigelow. The two would eventually meet, after Bigelow turned on Taz in a match against Shane Douglas and Chris Candido. Taz would ultimately lose the title to [[Bam Bam Bigelow]] at [[Living Dangerously (1998)|Living Dangerously]] on March 1, 1998.\n\nAfter losing the World Television Championship, Taz was elevated into the World Heavyweight Championship picture. In May 1998, with Shane Douglas injured and unable to wrestle, Taz was given an old World Television Championship belt painted orange\u2014his trademark color\u2014and began [[Glossary of professional wrestling terms#Promo|cutting promos]], declaring himself the [[ECW FTW Heavyweight Championship|FTW Heavyweight Champion]] at [[It Ain't Seinfeld]]. Though the championship was unsanctioned [[Kayfabe|in storyline]], it was defended at ECW shows until Douglas was healthy.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://prowrestlinghistory.com/ecw/results/1998c.html#080298|title=Heat Wave 1998 results|accessdate=July 22, 2007|publisher=Pro Wrestling History}}</ref> Just before winning the World Heavyweight Championship, Taz \"gave\" the FTW Heavyweight Title to long-time foe Sabu in a match where he physically pulled Sabu on top of him to allow him to get the pin.<ref name=\"SolieFTW\">{{cite web|url=http://www.solie.org/titlehistories/ftwecw.html|title=Fuck The World title history|accessdate=July 22, 2007|publisher=Solie's Title Histories}}</ref>\n\n==== World Heavyweight Champion and departure (1999) ====\nTaz finally defeated Shane Douglas for the World Heavyweight Championship at [[Guilty as Charged (1999)|Guilty as Charged]], thus ending Douglas' year-long reign.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://prowrestlinghistory.com/ecw/results/1999a.html#011099|title=Guilty as Charged 1999 results|accessdate=July 22, 2007|publisher=Pro Wrestling History}}</ref> Taz was supposed to defend the title against [[Chris Candido]] in his first televised title defense at [[House Party (1999)|House Party]] but Douglas attacked Candido before the match and took his place, whom Taz defeated to retain the title in his first successful title defense. He would then begin a feud with Sabu over Taz's World Heavyweight Championship and Sabu's FTW Heavyweight Championship. The rivalry culminated in a title unification match at the [[Living Dangerously (1999)|Living Dangerously]] pay-per-view, where Taz defeated Sabu to unify the FTW Heavyweight Championship into the World Heavyweight Championship.

The city has been controlled by numerous empires throughout the course of its history, including the [[Hindu Shahi]]s, [[Ghaznavids]], [[Ghurid dynasty|Ghurids]], and [[Delhi Sultanate]] by the medieval era. Lahore reached the height of its splendour under the [[Mughal Empire]] between the late 16th and early 18th century, and served as its capital city for a number of years. The city was captured by the forces of the [[Afsharid dynasty|Afsharid]] ruler [[Nader Shah]] in 1739, and fell into a period of decay while being contested between the Afghans and the Sikhs. Lahore eventually became capital of the [[Sikh Empire]] in the early 19th century, and regained some of its lost grandeur.<ref name=\"modern\" /> Lahore was then annexed to the [[British Empire]], and made capital of [[Punjab Province (British India)|British Punjab]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://tribune.com.pk/story/579971/rising-lahore-and-reviving-pakistan/|title=Rising Lahore and reviving Pakistan \u2013 The Express Tribune|date=21 July 2013|website=The Express Tribune|access-date=16 June 2016}}</ref> Lahore was central to the independence movements of both [[India]] and [[Pakistan]], with the city being the site of both the [[Purna Swaraj|declaration of Indian Independence]], and the [[Lahore Resolution|resolution calling for the establishment of Pakistan]].

They include the church's long-serving 19th-century rector, the Revd [[Pierce Galliard Smith]], and Colonel [[Colonel John George Nathaniel Gibbes (1787-1873)|John George Nathaniel Gibbes]], who occupied [[Government House, Canberra|Yarralumla]] homestead from 1859 until his death 14 years later. Gibbes was reputed to be the illegitimate son of a royal duke. Coincidentally, lying close to Gibbes' grave is the final resting place of another person with a link to the British throne, albeit one greatly separated in time and circumstance from that of the colonel. That person is [[Viscount Dunrossil]], a former [[Governor-General of Australia]], who died in office in 1961.<ref name=\"Salisbury\">{{Cite book |last=Salisbury |first=Jean |title=St John's Churchyard Canberra |publisher=Heraldry & Genealogy Society of Canberra Inc |year=2000 }}</ref>\n\nAlso interred in the churchyard are the remains of Colonel Gibbes' wife, Elizabeth, his son Augustus Gibbes (Yarralumla's proprietor from 1859 to 1881), his grandson Henry Edmund Gibbes, and his great-grandson, the Australian air ace [[Bobby Gibbes]] DSO, DFC and bar\u2014as well as St Christopher Battye and members of the pioneering McDonald, Guise, Shumack and Campbell families. The McDonalds are of Cranachan, Inverness Shire, Scotland, the same lineage as Flora Hannah McKillop (McDonald), mother of the Australian saint Mary McKillop.

Her headstone reads, \"For here we have no continuing city but seek one to come\", a slightly inexact quote of Hebrews 13:14. The biblical passage refers to a heavenly city hoped for by believers. Within a few decades after Webb's death it became apparent that the area was going to be the site of the future national capital. The quote on Webb's headstone started attracting notice, with many taking the passage to be a strange and coincidental prophecy of the coming city of Canberra. The prophetic tombstone, or \"Prophet\u2019s Tombstone\" as it eventually was known, rather quickly became a local landmark with travellers  visiting it.<ref>{{cite web |title=Take a step back in time and get in touch with Canberra's early history |url=https://www.stjohnscanberra.org/history |accessdate=11 April 2020}}</ref> \n\nThe churchyard was closed to new burials in 1937 unless exclusive rights to a plot were held.<ref>{{cite web |title=St John's Churchyard |url=https://www.stjohnscanberra.org/st-johns-churchyard |accessdate=11 April 2020}}</ref>\n\n===Schoolhouse museum===\n[[File:St John's Schoolhouse Museum.jpg|thumb|St John's Schoolhouse Museum]]\nCanberra\u2019s first schoolhouse was built in the first half of the 19th century by [[Robert Campbell (Australian landowner)|Robert Campbell]] of Duntroon for the education of workers\u2019 children. Consisting of a schoolroom with five attached rooms it served as the residence for the schoolmaster and his family. The building was constructed from rubble and bluestone quarried locally, with shingle roof and the walls two feet thick to afford protection from Canberra\u2019s harsh climate. The first students arrived in 1845 and it was the only school on the Limestone Plains until 1880 when the first public school was opened.<ref>{{cite web |title=St John's Church |url=https://www.canberratracks.act.gov.au/heritage-trails/track-2-the-limestone-plains/st-johns-church |publisher=Canberra Tracks |accessdate=12 April 2020}}</ref> Children walked across the fields to attend school and pioneering families on the school roll include the Blundell children who lived in nearby [[Blundell's Cottage]], one of the few stone buildings of its type to have survived intact in the [[Australian Capital Territory]].<ref>{{cite web |title=St John's Schoolhouse Museum |url=https://www.stjohnscanberra.org/st-johns-schoolhouse |accessdate=11 April 2020}}</ref>\n\nThe schoolhouse closed in 1907 and reopened in 1969 as a museum containing records and artifacts from Canberra's rural and recent past.

Her headstone reads, \"For here we have no continuing city but seek one to come\", a slightly inexact quote of Hebrews 13:14. The biblical passage refers to a heavenly city hoped for by believers. Within a few decades after Webb's death it became apparent that the area was going to be the site of the future national capital. The quote on Webb's headstone started attracting notice, with many taking the passage to be a strange and coincidental prophecy of the coming city of Canberra.

In the serial, the [[First Doctor]] ([[William Hartnell]]), his granddaughter [[Susan Foreman]] ([[Carole Ann Ford]]), and teachers [[Ian Chesterton]] ([[William Russell (English actor)|William Russell]]) and [[Barbara Wright (Doctor Who)|Barbara Wright]] ([[Jacqueline Hill]]) work with a human resistance group to travel to a Bedfordshire mine to stop the Daleks from mining out the Earth's core as part of their plan to pilot the Earth through space.\n\nThis serial marks the final regular appearance of Carole Ann Ford as [[companion (Doctor Who)|companion]] Susan.\n\n==Plot==\n{{plot|date=June 2018}}\nAfter the [[TARDIS]] materialises, [[Doctor (Doctor Who)|the Doctor]] surmises from the surroundings that they have landed in London, only to find it in ruins.

Then, due to the decay of the surrounding buildings and grounds, a bridge collapse causes girders to fall across the TARDIS, rendering it inaccessible. Barbara stays with Susan while the Doctor and Ian explore, and the women are taken by a couple of refugees to a nearby shelter in an abandoned [[London Underground|Underground]] station. There they meet resistance members Dortmun (the leader), Carl Tyler, David Campbell, Jenny, Thomson, Baker, and Larry Madison. Dortmun, a paraplegic scientist, has been working on a special type of bomb to destroy the Daleks' outer casings, and he and the others are preparing for an assault on the local Dalek headquarters.\n\nMeanwhile, the Doctor and Ian stumble across a body wearing a strange metal helmet and soon find an army of them as a [[Dalek]] rises from the [[River Thames]]. The Daleks take the Doctor and Ian, along with captured resistance members, including Jack Craddock, onboard their saucer, where they convert attempted escapees into [[List of Doctor Who henchmen#Robomen|Robomen]]. Ian does not understand why the Daleks still exist since the travellers saw them defeated on Skaro (in ''[[The Daleks]]''), but the Doctor reminds him that was far in the future. David and Craddock explain that the Daleks invaded Earth in the aftermath of a meteorite bombardment and a \"new kind of plague\" ten years prior, where humanity became divided and Asia, Africa and South America were wiped out. Sensing that the Doctor is highly intelligent, the Daleks leave a device in the cell with the prisoners which the Doctor solves, enabling them to escape. However, the Daleks are laying in wait and recapture them, drugging the Doctor and sending him to be converted into a Roboman. But the Doctor's transfer operation breaks down while Susan, Barbara and the resistance team attack the Dalek force using the explosives created by Dortmun. But the bombs are ineffective against the Daleks, and several resistance members are injured or killed.  David and Susan rescue the Doctor while Barbara gets separated from them and is able to return to the Underground with Jenny to report back to Dortmun. Ian is unable to escape; he and Larry hide beneath a floor grating as the saucer leaves for the Dalek mining operations in Bedfordshire.\n\nBefore leaving London, the Daleks give orders to the Robomen to set firebombs to destroy the city. Hiding from the Robomen, David, Susan and the Doctor see them set up a bomb and leave. The Doctor, still too weak from being drugged, collapses, and David uses some quick thinking to disarm the bomb. He and Susan try to find an escape route through the sewers while the Doctor rests, and they are found by Tyler. After collecting the Doctor, who is starting to feel better, they escape the city and head for the mining operation. David and Susan start falling in love, but keep it a secret from the others. Meanwhile, Dortmun, Jenny and Barbara make their way to an abandoned museum also used by the resistance as a hideout. Dortmun, after leaving his notebook for Barbara to find, confronts the Daleks, sacrificing himself so that the women have a chance to escape. They get an old truck working and crash their way through the Daleks, heading for the mining operations as Barbara is convinced that that is where the Doctor would go. They make it most of the way there before the truck is destroyed by a Dalek saucer.\n\nAt the mine, Ian and Larry escape the saucer and meet workers named Wells and Ashton; the latter is killed by an aggressive creature called a [[List of Doctor Who universe creatures and aliens#Slyther|Slyther]], a pet of the [[Dalek variants#Mark II Daleks|Black Dalek]]. The predator then falls from a suspended mine cart that Ian and Larry use to try to get away from it, and down a mineshaft to its death. The Daleks send the mine cart down the shaft before Ian and Larry can climb out.  The Doctor and his party arrive at the cliffs overlooking the mine, and he sends David and Susan on a mission to the far side of the cliffs to interfere with the radio signals the Daleks use to communicate with each other and the Robomen. The Doctor and Tyler begin climbing down into the mine. Barbara and Jenny find a hovel and, seeking shelter, meet two ragged women who are allowed to live on their own because they make clothing for the human slaves at the mine. These women pretend to befriend Barbara and Jenny before reporting them to the Daleks in return for food. The Daleks collect Barbara and Jenny and send them to work in the mine.\n\nAfter Larry is killed by his brother, who has been turned into a Roboman, Ian hides in the mine, eventually finding Wells again, and also seeing Barbara from a distance. Before he can get to her, however, he ends up hiding and being trapped in a capsule filled with explosives. Barbara uses Dortmun's notebook to bluff the Daleks into believing she has information about an imminent uprising and demands to speak with the Black Dalek. When she and Jenny are brought before it, they discover that the Daleks are drilling through the [[Earth]]'s crust so that they can blow out its core with a penetrative explosive capsule and then use a guidance system to pilot the planet around space. As the Daleks set the capsule in position and start the countdown, Ian scrambles the wiring inside the capsule, disarming it. When the shaft opens beneath the capsule, he escapes, but a Dalek cuts the rope he uses and he tumbles halfway down the shaft, stopping at a small access node. Leaving by the node, he jams a cord of wood across the shaft opening, preventing a re-armed explosive capsule from moving further down the shaft. While Barbara creates a diversion spinning a wild story about an uprising involving \"the Boston Tea Party\", \"General Lee's forces\" and \"Hannibal attacking from the Alps\", Jenny tries to access the machine which controls the Robomen to send them new orders. The Daleks catch on and, after rearming the capsule and launching it, trap the two in the control room to be killed in the explosion. The Doctor and Tyler, hiding outside the control room, enter when the Daleks leave and free Barbara and Jenny. Using the Daleks' scanners, they find David and Susan, who destroy the radio beacon, leaving the Robomen adrift and causing a temporary overload within the Daleks, who short circuit. Barbara and the Doctor give new orders to the Robomen to destroy the Daleks, and with the help of the Robomen, Wells and Tyler lead the human slaves in rebellion, destroying the inert Daleks and escaping the mine. Ian reunites with his friends and, before the capsule explodes, they all escape back up the cliffs to rejoin Susan and David. The bomb destroys the Dalek fleet and causes an entirely new phenomenon \u2013 a [[volcano|volcanic eruption]] in England.\n\nBack in London, Wells and Tyler help shift the girders away from the TARDIS. Susan has worn a hole in her shoe and the Doctor talks of mending it for her, but seems preoccupied and sad. Susan is also awkward, and after the Doctor goes back into the ship, she and David walk a short distance away. Declaring his love for her, David begs Susan to stay and marry him, saying he will give her a place to belong and a rooted identity, which earlier she told him she wanted to have someday. Susan agonises and protests that David is making her choose between him and her grandfather. Tearfully she says she must leave, but admits that she loves him. Suddenly, the TARDIS doors slam shut, and the Doctor, with Ian and Barbara at his side, bids Susan an emotional farewell, telling her that although they have always taken care of each other up until now, she is a grown woman and deserves a normal life with David. He promises to return one day, and sets the TARDIS in motion. The blue box disappears, and Susan, stunned, steps where it had been. David says that the Doctor must have known she would not leave him, and so chose to leave her. Taking David's hand, Susan walks away with him, intentionally leaving her TARDIS key behind.\n\n==Production==\n[[File:Caroleanneford86.jpg|thumb|left|upright|''The Dalek Invasion of Earth'' is the final regular appearance of Carole Ann Ford's character, Susan.]]\nThis was the very first serial of Doctor Who that made extensive use of location filming, with London being chosen as the primary backdrop. The decision to use London also helped to keep the show within its production budget given that the BBC's Lime Grove studios where Doctor Who was produced were located at nearby [[Shepherd's Bush]]. Location filming took place in various parts of the city including extensive sequences at [[Whitehall]], [[Trafalgar Square]], [[Westminster Bridge]], [[Albert Embankment]] and The [[Royal Albert Hall]], moving on to [[Kensington]] and the Albert Memorial with scenes involving the Dalek roadblock being filmed at [[Wembley]]. These scenes were shot in the early hours of Sunday mornings.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://drwhointerviews.wordpress.com/category/jacqueline-hill/|title=Jacqueline Hill|website=Doctor Who Interview Archive}}</ref>  Other location scenes were filmed at the abandoned [[Wood Lane (Central line) tube station]] in West London and river sequences both shot besides the [[River Thames]] at [[St Katharine Docks]] in Wapping and at [[Kew Railway Bridge]]. The mine scenes were the first ''Doctor Who'' scenes to be filmed in a quarry, using the disused John's Hole Quarry at [[Stone, Kent]].<ref>{{cite web|author=Kent Film Office|url=http://kentfilmoffice.co.uk/1964/11/doctor-who-the-dalek-invasion-of-earth-1964/|title=Kent Film Office The Dalek Invasion of Earth Article}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=The Dalek Invasion of Earth|url=http://www.doctorwholocations.net/stories/dalekinvasionofearth|publisher=Chuck Foster / News in Time and Space Ltd|accessdate=22 September 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite video|people=[[Gary Russell]]|year       =2003|title=Doctor Who \u2013 The Dalek Invasion of Earth|medium=DVD|publisher=BBC|time=6:38 in \"Now and Then\" feature on Disc 2|asin=B00009PBAN|asin-tld=co.uk|quote=This was the first ever quarry to be used in the making of Doctor Who.}}</ref>\n\nThe music was composed and conducted by [[Francis Chagrin]].<ref name=\"DrWho\">{{cite web|url=http://www.drwhoguide.com/who_k.htm|title=The Dalek Invasion of Earth|work=Dr Who guide|accessdate=2 January 2011}}</ref>\n\n===Alternative titles===\nWorking titles for this story included ''The Daleks'', ''The Return of the Daleks'' and ''The Invaders''.

In the serial, the [[First Doctor]] ([[William Hartnell]]), his granddaughter [[Susan Foreman]] ([[Carole Ann Ford]]), and teachers [[Ian Chesterton]] ([[William Russell (English actor)|William Russell]]) and [[Barbara Wright (Doctor Who)|Barbara Wright]] ([[Jacqueline Hill]]) work with a human resistance group to travel to a Bedfordshire mine to stop the Daleks from mining out the Earth's core as part of their plan to pilot the Earth through space.\n\nThis serial marks the final regular appearance of Carole Ann Ford as [[companion (Doctor Who)|companion]] Susan.\n\n==Plot==\n{{plot|date=June 2018}}\nAfter the [[TARDIS]] materialises, [[Doctor (Doctor Who)|the Doctor]] surmises from the surroundings that they have landed in London, only to find it in ruins.

Then, due to the decay of the surrounding buildings and grounds, a bridge collapse causes girders to fall across the TARDIS, rendering it inaccessible. Barbara stays with Susan while the Doctor and Ian explore, and the women are taken by a couple of refugees to a nearby shelter in an abandoned [[London Underground|Underground]] station. There they meet resistance members Dortmun (the leader), Carl Tyler, David Campbell, Jenny, Thomson, Baker, and Larry Madison. Dortmun, a paraplegic scientist, has been working on a special type of bomb to destroy the Daleks' outer casings, and he and the others are preparing for an assault on the local Dalek headquarters.\n\nMeanwhile, the Doctor and Ian stumble across a body wearing a strange metal helmet and soon find an army of them as a [[Dalek]] rises from the [[River Thames]]. The Daleks take the Doctor and Ian, along with captured resistance members, including Jack Craddock, onboard their saucer, where they convert attempted escapees into [[List of Doctor Who henchmen#Robomen|Robomen]]. Ian does not understand why the Daleks still exist since the travellers saw them defeated on Skaro (in ''[[The Daleks]]''), but the Doctor reminds him that was far in the future. David and Craddock explain that the Daleks invaded Earth in the aftermath of a meteorite bombardment and a \"new kind of plague\" ten years prior, where humanity became divided and Asia, Africa and South America were wiped out. Sensing that the Doctor is highly intelligent, the Daleks leave a device in the cell with the prisoners which the Doctor solves, enabling them to escape. However, the Daleks are laying in wait and recapture them, drugging the Doctor and sending him to be converted into a Roboman. But the Doctor's transfer operation breaks down while Susan, Barbara and the resistance team attack the Dalek force using the explosives created by Dortmun. But the bombs are ineffective against the Daleks, and several resistance members are injured or killed.  David and Susan rescue the Doctor while Barbara gets separated from them and is able to return to the Underground with Jenny to report back to Dortmun. Ian is unable to escape; he and Larry hide beneath a floor grating as the saucer leaves for the Dalek mining operations in Bedfordshire.\n\nBefore leaving London, the Daleks give orders to the Robomen to set firebombs to destroy the city. Hiding from the Robomen, David, Susan and the Doctor see them set up a bomb and leave. The Doctor, still too weak from being drugged, collapses, and David uses some quick thinking to disarm the bomb. He and Susan try to find an escape route through the sewers while the Doctor rests, and they are found by Tyler. After collecting the Doctor, who is starting to feel better, they escape the city and head for the mining operation. David and Susan start falling in love, but keep it a secret from the others. Meanwhile, Dortmun, Jenny and Barbara make their way to an abandoned museum also used by the resistance as a hideout. Dortmun, after leaving his notebook for Barbara to find, confronts the Daleks, sacrificing himself so that the women have a chance to escape. They get an old truck working and crash their way through the Daleks, heading for the mining operations as Barbara is convinced that that is where the Doctor would go. They make it most of the way there before the truck is destroyed by a Dalek saucer.\n\nAt the mine, Ian and Larry escape the saucer and meet workers named Wells and Ashton; the latter is killed by an aggressive creature called a [[List of Doctor Who universe creatures and aliens#Slyther|Slyther]], a pet of the [[Dalek variants#Mark II Daleks|Black Dalek]]. The predator then falls from a suspended mine cart that Ian and Larry use to try to get away from it, and down a mineshaft to its death. The Daleks send the mine cart down the shaft before Ian and Larry can climb out.  The Doctor and his party arrive at the cliffs overlooking the mine, and he sends David and Susan on a mission to the far side of the cliffs to interfere with the radio signals the Daleks use to communicate with each other and the Robomen. The Doctor and Tyler begin climbing down into the mine. Barbara and Jenny find a hovel and, seeking shelter, meet two ragged women who are allowed to live on their own because they make clothing for the human slaves at the mine. These women pretend to befriend Barbara and Jenny before reporting them to the Daleks in return for food. The Daleks collect Barbara and Jenny and send them to work in the mine.\n\nAfter Larry is killed by his brother, who has been turned into a Roboman, Ian hides in the mine, eventually finding Wells again, and also seeing Barbara from a distance. Before he can get to her, however, he ends up hiding and being trapped in a capsule filled with explosives. Barbara uses Dortmun's notebook to bluff the Daleks into believing she has information about an imminent uprising and demands to speak with the Black Dalek. When she and Jenny are brought before it, they discover that the Daleks are drilling through the [[Earth]]'s crust so that they can blow out its core with a penetrative explosive capsule and then use a guidance system to pilot the planet around space. As the Daleks set the capsule in position and start the countdown, Ian scrambles the wiring inside the capsule, disarming it. When the shaft opens beneath the capsule, he escapes, but a Dalek cuts the rope he uses and he tumbles halfway down the shaft, stopping at a small access node. Leaving by the node, he jams a cord of wood across the shaft opening, preventing a re-armed explosive capsule from moving further down the shaft. While Barbara creates a diversion spinning a wild story about an uprising involving \"the Boston Tea Party\", \"General Lee's forces\" and \"Hannibal attacking from the Alps\", Jenny tries to corrupt the machine which controls the Robomen and send them new orders. The Daleks catch them and, after rearming the capsule and launching it, trap the two in the control room to be killed in the explosion. The Doctor and Tyler, hiding outside the control room, enter when the Daleks leave and free Barbara and Jenny. Using the Daleks' scanners, they find David and Susan, who destroy the radio beacon, leaving the Robomen adrift and causing a temporary overload within the Daleks, who short circuit. Barbara and the Doctor give new orders to the Robomen to destroy the Daleks, and with the help of the Robomen, Wells and Tyler lead the human slaves in rebellion, destroying the inert Daleks and escaping the mine. Ian reunites with his friends and, before the capsule explodes, they all escape back up the cliffs to rejoin Susan and David. The bomb destroys the Dalek fleet and causes an entirely new phenomenon \u2013 a [[volcano|volcanic eruption]] in England.\n\nBack in London, Wells and Tyler help shift the girders away from the TARDIS. Susan has worn a hole in her shoe and the Doctor talks of mending it for her, but seems preoccupied and sad. Susan is also awkward, and after the Doctor goes back into the ship, she and David walk a short distance away. Declaring his love for her, David begs Susan to stay and marry him, saying he will give her a place to belong and a rooted identity, which earlier she told him she wanted to have someday. Susan agonises and protests that David is making her choose between him and her grandfather. Tearfully she says she must leave, but admits that she loves him. Suddenly, the TARDIS doors slam shut, and the Doctor, with Ian and Barbara at his side, bids Susan an emotional farewell, telling her that although they have always taken care of each other up until now, she is a grown woman and deserves a normal life with David. He promises to return one day, and sets the TARDIS in motion. The blue box disappears, and Susan, stunned, steps where it had been. David says that the Doctor must have known she would not leave him, and so chose to leave her. Taking David's hand, Susan walks away with him, intentionally leaving her TARDIS key behind.\n\n==Production==\n[[File:Caroleanneford86.jpg|thumb|left|upright|''The Dalek Invasion of Earth'' is the final regular appearance of Carole Ann Ford's character, Susan.]]\nThis was the very first serial of Doctor Who that made extensive use of location filming, with London being chosen as the primary backdrop. The decision to use London also helped to keep the show within its production budget given that the BBC's Lime Grove studios where Doctor Who was produced were located at nearby [[Shepherd's Bush]].

There were many detached parts of [[Worcestershire]] in the surrounding counties, and conversely there were islands of other counties within Worcestershire.  The 1844'' [[Counties (Detached Parts) Act 1844|Counties (Detached Parts) Act]]'' began the processing of eliminating these, but the process was not completed until 1966, when [[Dudley County Borough|Dudley]] was absorbed into [[Staffordshire]].\n\nThe expansion of [[Birmingham]] and the [[Black Country]] during and after the [[Industrial Revolution]] also altered the county map considerably.  Local government commissions were set up to recommend changes to the local government structures, and as early as 1945 recommendations were made to merge Worcestershire with [[Herefordshire]].  Eventually in 1974, a form of this recommendation was carried out, most of Worcestershire was combined with Herefordshire to form a new county named [[Hereford & Worcester]], while the northern Black Country towns and villages of Worcestershire, along with adjoining areas of Staffordshire and [[Warwickshire]], formed the new county of [[West Midlands County|West Midlands]].\n\nHereford & Worcester was re-divided into the separate counties of Herefordshire and Worcestershire in 1998. Since that time Worcestershire's boundaries have not changed. [[Redditch]] opted to join the [[West Midlands Combined Authority]] as an associate 'non-constituent' member in October 2015, although this will not affect the borough's status within Worcestershire.\n\n==Boundaries before 1844==\n[[Worcestershire]] was established as an administrative and defensive unit in 918,<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|title=Worcestershire|last=Brooks|first=Alan|last2=Pevsner|first2=Nikolaus|publisher=Yale University Press|year=2007|isbn=9780300112986|location=New Haven and London|pages=2}}</ref> to take into account the estates held by the [[Bishop of Worcester|Episcopus Hwicciorum]] and the abbeys of [[Pershore Abbey|Pershore]] and [[Evesham Abbey|Evesham]].

Other similar urban areas in England, such as [[Lancashire]], [[Tyneside]], [[London]] and within [[Yorkshire West Riding]], had grown in size since the Industrial Revolution. The expansion of these conurbations saw economic and physical integration with neighbouring towns and communities. This process became more prominent due to growing housing issues, extensive bombing during World War II, slum clearance, and continuing migration into urban areas. The Black Country contained a combination of county boroughs, urban districts, municipal boroughs and county councils (See Fig 6) taking responsibility for services, which resulted in a fragmented local government infrastructure. The ''[[Local Government Act 1958]]'' appointed a Local Government Commission to review administrative structures and boundaries in England outside London. The Act designated a ''West Midlands Special Review Area'',<ref>Local Government Act 1958 c.55</ref> whose recommendations would ultimately form the ''West Midlands Order 1965'' legislation. A second report known as the ''West Midlands General Review'' looked into the administrative authorities within the wider [[West Midlands (region)|region]], including the remainder of Worcestershire.<ref>Local Government Commission for England: Report No 2. West Midlands General Review</ref>\n\n===West Midlands Special Review Area===\nThe commission made its report in July 1961.  It recommended that the Black Country area should be administered by large county boroughs, and that the remaining urban districts or municipal boroughs be merged into these authorities. The original county council's responsibility for services within the majority of the conurbation were curtailed and association with the historic [[shire]] was for ceremonial purposes only. The West Midlands Special Review Area included Dudley, Oldbury, Stourbridge and Halesowen (as per Fig. 6). The latter two council areas were not incorporated into a county borough, as part of the eventual ''West Midlands Order 1965''. Halesowen was proposed to be included within an enlarged Smethwick County Borough, but a successful campaign entitled \"Hands off Halesowen\" orchestrated by a non-partisan group called the \"Halesowen Independence Committee\" helped stop the plans.<ref>[http://www.blackcountrybugle.co.uk Black Country Bugle] [http://www.blackcountrybugle.co.uk/hands-Hales-Owen-Towns-1960-Campaign-Independence/story-20123386-detail/story.html Hands off Halesowen \u2013 Town's 1960 Campaign For Independence] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140814151133/http://www.blackcountrybugle.co.uk/hands-Hales-Owen-Towns-1960-Campaign-Independence/story-20123386-detail/story.html |date=14 August 2014 }} \u2013 Retrieved 13 August 2014</ref>\n\nMeanwhile, the second report into the West Midland General Review area was also delivered in July 1961 and a proposal for Worcester to lose its county borough status<ref>The British Medical Journal \u2013 Vol. 1, No. 5242, 24 June 1961 \"Local Government Commission's Reports on West Midlands\"</ref> was not implemented.<ref>\"How Local government Areas Stand Today\", The Times, 12 February 1966</ref>\n\n===West Midlands Order 1965===\n{{multiple image\n| align = left\n| direction = horizontal\n| width = 250\n| image1 = West_Midlands_Order_1965.png\n| caption1 =  Fig 7: The boundaries of South Staffordshire, West Warwickshire and North Worcestershire after the local government reorganisations of the 1960s.\n| image2 = Warley map.png\n| caption2 = The County Borough of Warley \u2013 Warley's boundaries are shown as blue.

The county of Hereford & Worcester was to be reviewed again, despite an earlier structural review which recommended no change to the county.\n\nVarious options were put to consultation, including:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

''Preference of Malvern Hills District Council and supported by Leominster District Council.''\n|-\n| '''Hybrid''' || A unitary Herefordshire and two tier Worcestershire, based on pre-1974 boundaries (excluding Stourbridge & Halesowen).

''This was put forward by the commission as an alternative structure to the final recommendation''\n|}\n\nOther ideas put forward and discounted before the consultation stage included a complete restoration of the pre-1974 Worcestershire county boundary. This option included Stourbridge and Halesowen, as they were under the jurisdiction of Worcestershire County Council until 1 April 1974.

There were many detached parts of [[Worcestershire]] in the surrounding counties, and conversely there were islands of other counties within Worcestershire.  The 1844'' [[Counties (Detached Parts) Act 1844|Counties (Detached Parts) Act]]'' began the processing of eliminating these, but the process was not completed until 1966, when [[Dudley County Borough|Dudley]] was absorbed into [[Staffordshire]].\n\nThe expansion of [[Birmingham]] and the [[Black Country]] during and after the [[Industrial Revolution]] also altered the county map considerably.  Local government commissions were set up to recommend changes to the local government structures, and as early as 1945 recommendations were made to merge Worcestershire with [[Herefordshire]].  Eventually in 1974, a form of this recommendation was carried out, most of Worcestershire was combined with Herefordshire to form a new county named [[Hereford & Worcester]], while the northern Black Country towns and villages of Worcestershire, along with adjoining areas of Staffordshire and [[Warwickshire]], formed the new county of [[West Midlands County|West Midlands]].\n\nHereford & Worcester was re-divided into the separate counties of Herefordshire and Worcestershire in 1998. Since that time Worcestershire's boundaries have not changed. [[Redditch]] opted to join the [[West Midlands Combined Authority]] as an associate 'non-constituent' member in October 2015, although this will not affect the borough's status within Worcestershire.\n\n==Boundaries before 1844==\n[[Worcestershire]] was established as an administrative and defensive unit in 918,<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|title=Worcestershire|last=Brooks|first=Alan|last2=Pevsner|first2=Nikolaus|publisher=Yale University Press|year=2007|isbn=9780300112986|location=New Haven and London|pages=2}}</ref> to take into account the estates held by the [[Bishop of Worcester|Episcopus Hwicciorum]] and the abbeys of [[Pershore Abbey|Pershore]] and [[Evesham Abbey|Evesham]].

Other similar urban areas in England, such as [[Lancashire]], [[Tyneside]], [[London]] and within [[Yorkshire West Riding]], had grown in size since the Industrial Revolution. The expansion of these conurbations saw economic and physical integration with neighbouring towns and communities. This process became more prominent due to growing housing issues, extensive bombing during World War II, slum clearance, and continuing migration into urban areas. The Black Country contained a combination of county boroughs, urban districts, municipal boroughs and county councils (See Fig 6) taking responsibility for services, which resulted in a fragmented local government infrastructure. The ''[[Local Government Act 1958]]'' appointed a Local Government Commission to review administrative structures and boundaries in England outside London. The Act designated a ''West Midlands Special Review Area'',<ref>Local Government Act 1958 c.55</ref> whose recommendations would ultimately form the ''West Midlands Order 1965'' legislation. A second report known as the ''West Midlands General Review'' looked into the administrative authorities within the wider [[West Midlands (region)|region]], including the remainder of Worcestershire.<ref>Local Government Commission for England: Report No 2. West Midlands General Review</ref>\n\n===West Midlands Special Review Area===\nThe commission made its report in July 1961.  It recommended that the Black Country area should be administered by large county boroughs, and that the remaining urban districts or municipal boroughs be merged into these authorities. The original county council's responsibility for services within the majority of the conurbation were curtailed and association with the historic [[shire]] was for ceremonial purposes only. The West Midlands Special Review Area included Dudley, Oldbury, Stourbridge and Halesowen (as per Fig. 6). The latter two council areas were not incorporated into a county borough, as part of the eventual ''West Midlands Order 1965''. Halesowen was proposed to be included within an enlarged Smethwick County Borough, but a successful campaign entitled \"Hands off Halesowen\" orchestrated by a non-partisan group called the \"Halesowen Independence Committee\" helped stop the plans.<ref>[http://www.blackcountrybugle.co.uk Black Country Bugle] [http://www.blackcountrybugle.co.uk/hands-Hales-Owen-Towns-1960-Campaign-Independence/story-20123386-detail/story.html Hands off Halesowen \u2013 Town's 1960 Campaign For Independence] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140814151133/http://www.blackcountrybugle.co.uk/hands-Hales-Owen-Towns-1960-Campaign-Independence/story-20123386-detail/story.html |date=14 August 2014 }} \u2013 Retrieved 13 August 2014</ref>\n\nMeanwhile, the second report into the West Midland General Review area was also delivered in July 1961 and a proposal for Worcester to lose its county borough status<ref>The British Medical Journal \u2013 Vol. 1, No. 5242, 24 June 1961 \"Local Government Commission's Reports on West Midlands\"</ref> was not implemented.<ref>\"How Local government Areas Stand Today\", The Times, 12 February 1966</ref>\n\n===West Midlands Order 1965===\n{{multiple image\n| align = left\n| direction = horizontal\n| width = 250\n| image1 = West_Midlands_Order_1965.png\n| caption1 =  Fig 7: The boundaries of South Staffordshire, West Warwickshire and North Worcestershire after the local government reorganisations of the 1960s.\n| image2 = Warley map.png\n| caption2 = The County Borough of Warley \u2013 Warley's boundaries are shown as blue.
