First, it was a football club. In 1957, a volleyball section was created. In 1977 the football section was separated from the club and incorporated into [[Be\u0142chat\u00f3w Coal Mine|KWB Be\u0142chat\u00f3w]]. In 1991 [[Be\u0142chat\u00f3w Power Station]] became the sponsor of the club, and the club changed its name to Energetyczny Klub Sportowy (Energetic Sports Club) ''Skra''. In 1994, the club advanced to Polish league II, and in 1997 to league I \"B\" series. In 1999, it was promoted to series \"A\", but after a year it fell back down to series \"B\" again.\n\nIn 2001, the club led by [[Wies\u0142aw Czaja]] was promoted to [[PlusLiga]].

At this tournament after promoting from Pool B, ''PGE Skra'' won their semi final against [[VC Zenit-Kazan]] (3-1), but on November 8, 2009 the Polish club lost the final against [[Trentino Volley]] (0-3). 2 of 7 individual awards were received by ''PGE Skra'' players - [[Bartosz Kurek]] as the ''Best Scorer'', [[Marcin Mo\u017cd\u017conek]] as the ''Best Blocker''.\nIn 2010 the Polish team was the host of the Final Four [[2009\u201310 CEV Champions League|CEV Champions League 2009/2010]] again.

The [[population]] was 16,283 at the 2010 census.<ref name=\"2010_Census\"/> A former farming and [[mill town]], Amesbury is today largely residential.  It is one of the two northernmost towns in Massachusetts (the other being neighboring [[Salisbury, Massachusetts|Salisbury]]).\n\n==History==\n\n===Settlement period===\nIn 1637 the first English settler in the Salisbury-Amesbury region, Zachary Davis, crossed the [[Merrimack River]] from the new settlement at [[Newbury, Massachusetts|Newbury]], built a log cabin, and began to clear the land for cultivation. He intended to send to England for his wife and children, but they never did rejoin him.<ref>{{harvnb|Merrill|1880|pp=6\u20137}}.</ref> He and his hired man, William Schooler, were arrested shortly for a murder Schooler had committed. The latter was hanged for it. Bayly was acquitted. Given the fishing rights on the river by the subsequent settlement, provided he would sell only to it, he abandoned agriculture for fishing.<ref>{{harvnb|Merrill|1880|p=22}}.</ref>\n\nOn September 6, 1638, the [[General Court of Massachusetts]] created a plantation on behalf of several petitioners from Newbury, on the left bank of the Merrimack, as far north as [[Hampton, New Hampshire|Hampton]], to be called Merrimac. They were given permission to associate together as a township. Middens of shells and arrowheads marked the former locations of native villages. They had fallen victim to [[smallpox]]. The area remained in possession of the tribes along the Merrimack, who hunted and fished there. The settlers formed a militia to counteract the possible threat of conflict. One especially abundant site of middens at the top of a hill, from which a river cascaded, was called by the settlers Powawus (Pow-wow), from the native congress believed to have been held there, and the river, the [[Powwow River|Powawus]] River.<ref>{{harvnb|Merrill|1880|pp=5\u20136}}.</ref> The hill is part of the left bank of the Merrimack and the river originates in New Hampshire. Today this cascade, sometimes called falls, remains sunken in an urban environment, from which it tends to collect debris.\n\nThe settlers of the plantation, who entered [[Massachusetts Bay Colony]] through Newbury, were rebels in a cause shortly to be settled by the [[English Civil War]] (1642-1651). Although nominally subjects of the crown, they did not in any way obey it. They did maintain close ties with the Parliamentary cause in Britain. The supreme government of the colony was the General Court, which functioned autonomously, passing its own laws, establishing courts, incorporating townships, assuming the power of life and death over its colonists and providing for the overall defense of the colony. They established a Puritan church rather than the Church of England, enforcing this establishment with severe penalties.\n\nIn the early spring of 1639 about 60 planters took up residence on land cleared by the natives. In May an elected planning committee of five laid out the green, the initial streets, the burial ground, and especially the first division into lots, apportioning the size of a lot to the wealth of the settler.<ref>{{harvnb|Merrill|1880|pp=9\u201310}}.</ref> On September 4 the General Court named the town Colchester, but in October changed the name to Salisbury, probably at the instigation of Christopher Batt, from [[Salisbury]], England. A soldier, he trained the first militia. In November the General Court appointed a government of six, which required that every lot owner take up residence on his lot. They began to assign lots west of the Pow-wow river. On October 7, 1640, the General Court incorporated Salisbury; that is, it granted legal recognition by the colony to a township of that name, with its own government, empowered by citizens populating a territory of legally defined boundaries. The original Salisbury was many times larger than the present. From it several townships were later separated.<ref>{{harvnb|Arrington|1922|p=42}}.</ref>\n\nOn January 12, 1641, a town meeting ordered the first roads north and west of the Pow-wow to be laid out. On April 21 another meeting granted to William Osgood 50 acres of \"upland\" and 10 of \"meadow\" along the Pow-wow provided he build the town's first [[sawmill]]. It utilized a water wheel driven by the Pow-wow.<ref>{{harvnb|Merrill|1880|p=20}}.</ref> The mill produced lumber for local use, but also pipe-staves for export. In these times before the separation of Newburyport and the opening of Newburyport Harbor by dredging a new channel, the export route ran down the Pow-Pow, across the Merrimack on a ferry where the public landing now is, over Ferry Road, partly abandoned as Old Ferry Road, and along what is now High Street, Newburyport, to the docks of the Parker River near Lower Green, Newbury. A [[gristmill]] was added to the Pow-wow river location in 1642. The {{convert|90|ft|m|adj=on}} drop of the Powwow River provided [[water power]] for a subsequent mill complex. In 1642 also the town ordered 30 families to take up residence west of the Pow-wow and form a \"New Town.\" No volunteers responded.<ref>{{harvnb|Merrill|1880|pp=24\u201325}}.</ref> However, this date, the first legal recognition of a municipal entity on the site of Amesbury, is termed its \"settlement\" by many sources.\n\nOn May 10, 1643, the General Court divided Massachusetts Bay Colony into four shires: Essex, Norfolk, Middlesex and Suffolk. The choice of these names was etymologic relative to Boston (Norfolk is \"North Folk,\" etc.). Norfolk contained Salisbury, Hampton, Haverhill, Exeter, Dover, and Strawberry Bank (Portsmouth), none of which had exactly the borders they have now. This division was a legal convenience based on the distribution of courts. Since the first establishment of four courts on March 3, 1635, the General Court had found it necessary to multiply and distribute courts, so that the magistrates would not spend time in travel that they needed for settling case loads. The main requirement for membership in a shire was incorporation.<ref>{{harvnb|Arrington|1922|pp=41\u201342}}.</ref>\n\nPrivate occupation of the west bank of the Pow-wow went on as East Salisbury citizens sold their property and moved to New Town.<ref>{{harvnb|Merrill|1880|p=50}}.</ref> However, New Town remained a paper construct without enforcement. On January 14, 1654, articles of agreement adopted at town meeting divided Salisbury into Old Town and New Town, each to conduct its own affairs. The border was the Pow-wow. The agreement went into effect on January 19, 1655. In New Town a new government was voted in, which claimed authority over \"all matters of publicke concernment.\"<ref>{{harvnb|Merrill|1880|p=54}}.</ref> They still paid taxes to Old Town and expected services from it. The board of Old Town contained some members from New Town for fair representation.<ref>{{harvnb|Merrill|1880|p=56}}.</ref> This agreement also was known as a \"settlement\", but not in the sense of occupying land, which was already occupied.\n\nOn May 26, 1658, New Town petitioned the General Court for independent town status. However, Old Town reneged on the settlement. The petition was denied. The issue focused on religion. The law established the Congregational Church, which meant attendance was mandatory, on penalty of a fine for each missed meeting, and the church and preacher must be maintained from taxes. Old Town simply could not afford to lose the taxes to a new church. Minister Joseph Peasley of New Town and his congregation attempting to defy the General Court were summoned into District Court at Ipswich \"to answer for their disobedience\" and were fined there. Peasly was enjoined from preaching.<ref>{{harvnb|Merrill|1880|pp=60\u201361}}.</ref> The issue dragged on. Another petition was denied in 1660.\n\nThe burden of attending church several miles away became so great that New Town built a new meeting house and requested the General Court to find a preacher. The court yielded to the petition of 1666, granting the \"liberty of a township\" to New Town. The town was unofficially incorporated; that is, a government was constituted and officers elected, on June 15. It was named New Salisbury, but in 1667 the name was changed to Amesbury on the analogy of [[Amesbury]], England, which was next to Salisbury, England.<ref>{{harvnb|Merrill|1880|p=91}}.</ref> This basis is unrelated to any etymology of the two names. Amesbury was officially granted incorporation under that name on April 29, 1668.\n\nBy then the days of unquestioned Puritan power were over. The English king had been restored in 1660, followed by the execution of the leading Puritans as regicides and an attempt to bring the Puritan colony under control of the crown. [[Charles II of England|Charles II]] attempted to take more of a role in colonial affairs, generally without success. The long struggle between the royalist governor and the General Court began, that court losing much of its power. They were preoccupied for a time by [[King Phillips War]] (1675\u201378), the last maximum effort by the natives to rid themselves of the Yankees. At the end of it the creation of the Royal Province of New Hampshire took away several towns in northern Norfolk shire, brooking the power of the General Court. Massachusetts was reduced in size from most of New England to roughly its current borders. The Court now dissolved Norfolk Shire, transferring Salisbury and Amesbury to Essex County. The issue was by no means settled; the previous northern Norfolk Shire changed colonies a few more times before finally voting to stay in New Hampshire.\n\nIn 1876 [[Merrimac, Massachusetts|Merrimac]] was created out of West Amesbury. In 1886 West Salisbury was annexed to Amesbury, unifying the mill areas on both banks of the Pow-wow River.\n\n===Post-settlement===\nBeginning as a modest farming community, it developed an aggressive maritime and industrial economy.  [[Shipbuilding]], [[shipping]] and [[fishing]] were also important. The [[ferry]] across the [[Merrimack River]] to [[Newburyport, Massachusetts|Newburyport]] was a lively business until the construction of bridges to Deer Island.  [[Newton, New Hampshire|Newton]], [[New Hampshire]], was set off from Amesbury in 1741, when the [[northern boundary of Massachusetts|border between the two colonies]] was adjusted.\n\nIn the 19th century, [[textile]] mills were built at the falls, as was a mechanized nail-making factory, believed to be the nation's first.  The [[Merrimac Hat Company]] produced more hats than any of its competitors.  Beginning in 1853, Amesbury became famous for building carriages, a trade which evolved into the manufacture of automobile bodies.  Prominent manufacturers included [[Walker Body Company]], [[Briggs Carriage Company]], and [[Biddle and Smart]]. The industry ended with the [[Great Depression]].  Amesbury also produced Hoyt's Buffalo Brand Peanut Butter Kisses.\n\nNewspapers in the 19th century included the ''Amesbury Daily News'', ''Merrimac Journal'', ''Morning Courier'', ''Evening Courier'', ''New England Chronicle'', ''Transcript'', and the ''Villager''. Newspapers in the 20th century included the ''Amesbury Advocate'', ''Amesbury News'', ''Amesbury Times'', and ''Leader''.<ref name=\"bpl-microtext\">{{cite web |url=http://www.bpl.org/research/microtext/news.htm |title=Massachusetts Newspapers |author=Boston Public Library, Microtext Department |work=Newspapers on Microfilm |accessdate=13 May 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |title=Rowell's American Newspaper Directory |year=1909 |publisher=Printer's Ink Pub.

Following a recent restoration of the historic downtown, many new restaurants opened.  The \"[[Doughboy]]\", a memorial sculpture by Leonard Craske, stands on the front lawn of the Amesbury Middle School.  It was dedicated November 11, 1929.  Craske is best known as sculptor for the \"Fishermens' Memorial\" in [[Gloucester, Massachusetts|Gloucester]].

Powwow Hill, elevation {{convert|331|ft}}, is the highest point in town.  Once the site of [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Indian]] gatherings, or \"[[powwow]]s\", it has views to [[Maine]] and [[Cape Ann]]. Amesbury is the second northernmost town in Massachusetts, its northernmost point coming just south of the northernmost point of the state, in Salisbury.  Amesbury lies along the northern banks of the [[Merrimack River]] and is bordered by [[Salisbury, Massachusetts|Salisbury]] to the east, [[Newburyport, Massachusetts|Newburyport]] to the southeast, [[West Newbury, Massachusetts|West Newbury]] to the southwest, [[Merrimac, Massachusetts|Merrimac]] to the west, and [[South Hampton, New Hampshire]], to the north.\n\nThe Powwow River bisects the town, joined by the [[Back River (Powwow River)|Back River]] near the town center. The river flows through Lake Gardner and [[Tuxbury Pond]], which are two of several inland bodies of water in town, including [[Lake Attitash]] (which is partially in Merrimac), Meadowbrook Pond, and Pattens Pond.  Several brooks also flow through the town.  Amesbury has a town forest, which is connected to Woodsom Farm, as well as Powwow Conservation Area, Victoria Batchelder Park and Amesbury Golf & Country Club.\n\n==Transportation==\n\n[[Image:Amesbury - Whittier View 1.JPG|thumb|left|320px|Whittier Memorial Bridge, which conducts Route 95, a major highway, between Newburyport and Amesbury]]\nAmesbury is served by two interstate highways.  [[Interstate 495 (Massachusetts)|Interstate 495]] runs from west to east through town, ending at [[Interstate 95]] just over the Salisbury town line.  It has two exits in town, Exit 54 at [[Massachusetts Route 150]] (which lies entirely within Amesbury, and leads to [[New Hampshire Route 150]]) and Exit 55 at [[Massachusetts Route 110]], which also provides the town's only direct access to [[Interstate 95 in Massachusetts|Interstate 95]] at Exit 58.  I-95 crosses the southeast corner of town, entering along the [[John Greenleaf Whittier]] Memorial Bridge, a steel through-truss bridge crossing the Merrimack River.  The Whittier Memorial Bridge lies just west of the town's only other bridges across the Merrimack, the Derek S. Hines Memorial Bridge, which connects Amesbury to Deer Island (which is still part of Amesbury), and the [[Chain Bridge (Massachusetts)|Chain Bridge]], the only [[suspension bridge]] in Massachusetts, which spans from Deer Island to Newburyport.  The current version was built in 1909, but was predated by the 1810 suspension bridge, one of the oldest suspension bridges in the country.  The Chain Bridge and its counterparts over the years have been the main entryways into town across the Merrimack, and until the building of the Newburyport Turnpike Bridge, it was the easternmost bridge on the Merrimack River.\n\n[[Merrimack Valley Regional Transit Authority|MVRTA]] provides bus service in Amesbury. Route 51 connects to the [[Haverhill (Amtrak station)|Haverhill train station]]. Route 54 connects to [[Newburyport (MBTA station)|Newburyport train station]].\n\n{{Historical populations\n|type= USA\n|align= right\n|width= 17em\n|1840|2471\n|1850|3143\n|1860|3877\n|1870|5581\n|1880|3355\n|1890|9798\n|1900|9473\n|1910|9894\n|1920|10036\n|1930|11899\n|1940|10862\n|1950|10851\n|1960|10787\n|1970|11388\n|1980|13971\n|1990|14997\n|2000|16450\n|2010|16283\n|2018|17569\n|source=<center>U.S. Decennial Census<ref name=\"DecennialCensus\">{{cite web |url=https://www.census.gov/prod/www/decennial.html |title=Census of Population and Housing |publisher=Census.gov |accessdate=June 4, 2015 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150426102944/http://www.census.gov/prod/www/decennial.html |archivedate=April 26, 2015 }}</ref></center>\n|footnote=* population estimate. {{Historical populations/Massachusetts municipalities references}}\n}}\n\n==Demographics==\n{{See also|List of Massachusetts locations by per capita income}}\n[[Image:Main Street from Market Square, Amesbury, MA.jpg|thumb|left|Main Street from Market Square in 1911]]\n[[File:Lowell's Boat Shop, Amesbury MA.jpg|thumb|right|<center>Lowell's Boat Shop</center>]]\nAs of the [[census]] of 2000, there were 16,450 people, 6,380 households, and 4,229 families residing in the city.<ref name=census2000>[http://factfinder.census.gov/servlet/GCTTable?_bm=y&-geo_id=04000US25&-_box_head_nbr=GCT-PH1&-ds_name=DEC_2000_SF1_U&-format=ST-7 Census 2000] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100727061223/http://factfinder.census.gov/servlet/GCTTable?_bm=y&-geo_id=04000US25&-_box_head_nbr=GCT-PH1&-ds_name=DEC_2000_SF1_U&-format=ST-7 |date=July 27, 2010 }}</ref> The [[population density]] was 1,326.3 people per square mile (512.2/km\u00b2).

The [[population]] was 16,283 at the 2010 census.<ref name=\"2010_Census\"/> A former farming and [[mill town]], Amesbury is today largely residential.  It is one of the two northernmost towns in Massachusetts (the other being neighboring [[Salisbury, Massachusetts|Salisbury]]).\n\n==History==\n\n===Settlement period===\nIn 1637 the first English settler in the Salisbury-Amesbury region, Zachary Davis, crossed the [[Merrimack River]] from the new settlement at [[Newbury, Massachusetts|Newbury]], built a log cabin, and began to clear the land for cultivation. He intended to send to England for his wife and children, but they never did rejoin him.<ref>{{harvnb|Merrill|1880|pp=6\u20137}}.</ref> He and his hired man, William Schooler, were arrested shortly for a murder Schooler had committed. The latter was hanged for it. Bayly was acquitted. Given the fishing rights on the river by the subsequent settlement, provided he would sell only to it, he abandoned agriculture for fishing.<ref>{{harvnb|Merrill|1880|p=22}}.</ref>\n\nOn September 6, 1638, the [[General Court of Massachusetts]] created a plantation on behalf of several petitioners from Newbury, on the left bank of the Merrimack, as far north as [[Hampton, New Hampshire|Hampton]], to be called Merrimac. They were given permission to associate together as a township. Middens of shells and arrowheads marked the former locations of native villages. They had fallen victim to [[smallpox]]. The area remained in possession of the tribes along the Merrimack, who hunted and fished there. The settlers formed a militia to counteract the possible threat of conflict. One especially abundant site of middens at the top of a hill, from which a river cascaded, was called by the settlers Powawus (Pow-wow), from the native congress believed to have been held there, and the river, the [[Powwow River|Powawus]] River.<ref>{{harvnb|Merrill|1880|pp=5\u20136}}.</ref> The hill is part of the left bank of the Merrimack and the river originates in New Hampshire. Today this cascade, sometimes called falls, remains sunken in an urban environment, from which it tends to collect debris.\n\nThe settlers of the plantation, who entered [[Massachusetts Bay Colony]] through Newbury, were rebels in a cause shortly to be settled by the [[English Civil War]] (1642-1651). Although nominally subjects of the crown, they did not in any way obey it. They did maintain close ties with the Parliamentary cause in Britain. The supreme government of the colony was the General Court, which functioned autonomously, passing its own laws, establishing courts, incorporating townships, assuming the power of life and death over its colonists and providing for the overall defense of the colony. They established a Puritan church rather than the Church of England, enforcing this establishment with severe penalties.\n\nIn the early spring of 1639 about 60 planters took up residence on land cleared by the natives. In May an elected planning committee of five laid out the green, the initial streets, the burial ground, and especially the first division into lots, apportioning the size of a lot to the wealth of the settler.<ref>{{harvnb|Merrill|1880|pp=9\u201310}}.</ref> On September 4 the General Court named the town Colchester, but in October changed the name to Salisbury, probably at the instigation of Christopher Batt, from [[Salisbury]], England. A soldier, he trained the first militia. In November the General Court appointed a government of six, which required that every lot owner take up residence on his lot. They began to assign lots west of the Pow-wow river. On October 7, 1640, the General Court incorporated Salisbury; that is, it granted legal recognition by the colony to a township of that name, with its own government, empowered by citizens populating a territory of legally defined boundaries. The original Salisbury was many times larger than the present. From it several townships were later separated.<ref>{{harvnb|Arrington|1922|p=42}}.</ref>\n\nOn January 12, 1641, a town meeting ordered the first roads north and west of the Pow-wow to be laid out. On April 21 another meeting granted to William Osgood 50 acres of \"upland\" and 10 of \"meadow\" along the Pow-wow provided he build the town's first [[sawmill]]. It utilized a water wheel driven by the Pow-wow.<ref>{{harvnb|Merrill|1880|p=20}}.</ref> The mill produced lumber for local use, but also pipe-staves for export. In these times before the separation of Newburyport and the opening of Newburyport Harbor by dredging a new channel, the export route ran down the Pow-Pow, across the Merrimack on a ferry where the public landing now is, over Ferry Road, partly abandoned as Old Ferry Road, and along what is now High Street, Newburyport, to the docks of the Parker River near Lower Green, Newbury. A [[gristmill]] was added to the Pow-wow river location in 1642. The {{convert|90|ft|m|adj=on}} drop of the Powwow River provided [[water power]] for a subsequent mill complex. In 1642 also the town ordered 30 families to take up residence west of the Pow-wow and form a \"New Town.\" No volunteers responded.<ref>{{harvnb|Merrill|1880|pp=24\u201325}}.</ref> However, this date, the first legal recognition of a municipal entity on the site of Amesbury, is termed its \"settlement\" by many sources.\n\nOn May 10, 1643, the General Court divided Massachusetts Bay Colony into four shires: Essex, Norfolk, Middlesex and Suffolk. The choice of these names was etymologic relative to Boston (Norfolk is \"North Folk,\" etc.). Norfolk contained Salisbury, Hampton, Haverhill, Exeter, Dover, and Strawberry Bank (Portsmouth), none of which had exactly the borders they have now. This division was a legal convenience based on the distribution of courts. Since the first establishment of four courts on March 3, 1635, the General Court had found it necessary to multiply and distribute courts, so that the magistrates would not spend time in travel that they needed for settling case loads. The main requirement for membership in a shire was incorporation.<ref>{{harvnb|Arrington|1922|pp=41\u201342}}.</ref>\n\nPrivate occupation of the west bank of the Pow-wow went on as East Salisbury citizens sold their property and moved to New Town.<ref>{{harvnb|Merrill|1880|p=50}}.</ref> However, New Town remained a paper construct without enforcement. On January 14, 1654, articles of agreement adopted at town meeting divided Salisbury into Old Town and New Town, each to conduct its own affairs. The border was the Pow-wow. The agreement went into effect on January 19, 1655. In New Town a new government was voted in, which claimed authority over \"all matters of publicke concernment.\"<ref>{{harvnb|Merrill|1880|p=54}}.</ref> They still paid taxes to Old Town and expected services from it. The board of Old Town contained some members from New Town for fair representation.<ref>{{harvnb|Merrill|1880|p=56}}.</ref> This agreement also was known as a \"settlement\", but not in the sense of occupying land, which was already occupied.\n\nOn May 26, 1658, New Town petitioned the General Court for independent town status. However, Old Town reneged on the settlement. The petition was denied. The issue focused on religion. The law established the Congregational Church, which meant attendance was mandatory, on penalty of a fine for each missed meeting, and the church and preacher must be maintained from taxes. Old Town simply could not afford to lose the taxes to a new church. Minister Joseph Peasley of New Town and his congregation attempting to defy the General Court were summoned into District Court at Ipswich \"to answer for their disobedience\" and were fined there. Peasly was enjoined from preaching.<ref>{{harvnb|Merrill|1880|pp=60\u201361}}.</ref> The issue dragged on. Another petition was denied in 1660.\n\nThe burden of attending church several miles away became so great that New Town built a new meeting house and requested the General Court to find a preacher. The court yielded to the petition of 1666, granting the \"liberty of a township\" to New Town. The town was unofficially incorporated; that is, a government was constituted and officers elected, on June 15. It was named New Salisbury, but in 1667 the name was changed to Amesbury on the analogy of [[Amesbury]], England, which was next to Salisbury, England.<ref>{{harvnb|Merrill|1880|p=91}}.</ref> This basis is unrelated to any etymology of the two names. Amesbury was officially granted incorporation under that name on April 29, 1668.\n\nBy then the days of unquestioned Puritan power were over. The English king had been restored in 1660, followed by the execution of the leading Puritans as regicides and an attempt to bring the Puritan colony under control of the crown. [[Charles II of England|Charles II]] attempted to take more of a role in colonial affairs, generally without success. The long struggle between the royalist governor and the General Court began, that court losing much of its power. They were preoccupied for a time by [[King Phillips War]] (1675\u201378), the last maximum effort by the natives to rid themselves of the Yankees. At the end of it the creation of the Royal Province of New Hampshire took away several towns in northern Norfolk shire, brooking the power of the General Court. Massachusetts was reduced in size from most of New England to roughly its current borders. The Court now dissolved Norfolk Shire, transferring Salisbury and Amesbury to Essex County. The issue was by no means settled; the previous northern Norfolk Shire changed colonies a few more times before finally voting to stay in New Hampshire.\n\nIn 1876 [[Merrimac, Massachusetts|Merrimac]] was created out of West Amesbury. In 1886 West Salisbury was annexed to Amesbury, unifying the mill areas on both banks of the Pow-wow River.\n\n===Post-settlement===\nBeginning as a modest farming community, it developed an aggressive maritime and industrial economy.  [[Shipbuilding]], [[shipping]] and [[fishing]] were also important. The [[ferry]] across the [[Merrimack River]] to [[Newburyport, Massachusetts|Newburyport]] was a lively business until the construction of bridges to Deer Island.  [[Newton, New Hampshire|Newton]], [[New Hampshire]], was set off from Amesbury in 1741, when the [[northern boundary of Massachusetts|border between the two colonies]] was adjusted.\n\nIn the 19th century, [[textile]] mills were built at the falls, as was a mechanized nail-making factory, believed to be the nation's first.  The [[Merrimac Hat Company]] produced more hats than any of its competitors.  Beginning in 1853, Amesbury became famous for building carriages, a trade which evolved into the manufacture of automobile bodies.  Prominent manufacturers included [[Walker Body Company]], [[Briggs Carriage Company]], and [[Biddle and Smart]]. The industry ended with the [[Great Depression]].  Amesbury also produced Hoyt's Buffalo Brand Peanut Butter Kisses.\n\nNewspapers in the 19th century included the ''Amesbury Daily News'', ''Merrimac Journal'', ''Morning Courier'', ''Evening Courier'', ''New England Chronicle'', ''Transcript'', and the ''Villager''. Newspapers in the 20th century included the ''Amesbury Advocate'', ''Amesbury News'', ''Amesbury Times'', and ''Leader''.<ref name=\"bpl-microtext\">{{cite web |url=http://www.bpl.org/research/microtext/news.htm |title=Massachusetts Newspapers |author=Boston Public Library, Microtext Department |work=Newspapers on Microfilm |accessdate=13 May 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |title=Rowell's American Newspaper Directory |year=1909 |publisher=Printer's Ink Pub.

Following a recent restoration of the historic downtown, many new restaurants opened.  The \"[[Doughboy]]\", a memorial sculpture by Leonard Craske, stands on the front lawn of the Amesbury Middle School.  It was dedicated November 11, 1929.  Craske is best known as sculptor for the \"Fishermens' Memorial\" in [[Gloucester, Massachusetts|Gloucester]].  There is here a monument erected to [[Josiah Bartlett]], who was born in Amesbury.\n\n<gallery>\nImage:Macy House, Amesbury, MA.jpg|''Thomas Macy House'' c. 1905\nImage:Mills, Amesbury, MA.jpg|''Mills'' in 1914\nImage:Josiah Bartlett's Statue, Amesbury, MA.jpg|''Statue of [[Josiah Bartlett]], signer of the [[Declaration of Independence]],'' c. 1910\nImage:Whittier's Home, Amesbury, MA.jpg|''Whittier's home'' in 1909\n</gallery>\n\n==Geography==\n[[Image:View from Powwow Hill, Amesbury, MA.jpg|thumb|right|View northeast from Powwow Hill]]\nAmesbury is located at {{Coord|42|51|29|N|70|55|50|W|}}.<ref name=\"GR1\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/geo/www/gazetteer/gazette.html|publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]]|accessdate=2011-04-23|date=2011-02-12|title=US Gazetteer files: 2010, 2000, and 1990}}</ref>  According to the [[United States Census Bureau]], the city has a total area of {{convert|35.5|sqkm|order=flip}}, of which {{convert|31.8|sqkm|order=flip}} is land and {{convert|3.8|sqkm|order=flip}}, or 10.65%, is water.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://factfinder2.census.gov |title=Geographic Identifiers: 2010 Demographic Profile Data (G001): Amesbury Town city, Massachusetts |publisher=U.S. Census Bureau, American Factfinder |accessdate=August 30, 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130911234518/http://factfinder2.census.gov/ |archivedate=September 11, 2013 }}</ref> Amesbury is drained by the [[Powwow River]].  Powwow Hill, elevation {{convert|331|ft}}, is the highest point in town.  Once the site of [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Indian]] gatherings, or \"[[powwow]]s\", it has views to [[Maine]] and [[Cape Ann]]. Amesbury is the second northernmost town in Massachusetts, its northernmost point coming just south of the northernmost point of the state, in Salisbury.  Amesbury lies along the northern banks of the [[Merrimack River]] and is bordered by [[Salisbury, Massachusetts|Salisbury]] to the east, [[Newburyport, Massachusetts|Newburyport]] to the southeast, [[West Newbury, Massachusetts|West Newbury]] to the southwest, [[Merrimac, Massachusetts|Merrimac]] to the west, and [[South Hampton, New Hampshire]], to the north.\n\nThe Powwow River bisects the town, joined by the [[Back River (Powwow River)|Back River]] near the town center. The river flows through Lake Gardner and [[Tuxbury Pond]], which are two of several inland bodies of water in town, including [[Lake Attitash]] (which is partially in Merrimac), Meadowbrook Pond, and Pattens Pond.  Several brooks also flow through the town.  Amesbury has a town forest, which is connected to Woodsom Farm, as well as Powwow Conservation Area, Victoria Batchelder Park and Amesbury Golf & Country Club.\n\n==Transportation==\n\n[[Image:Amesbury - Whittier View 1.JPG|thumb|left|320px|Whittier Memorial Bridge, which conducts Route 95, a major highway, between Newburyport and Amesbury]]\nAmesbury is served by two interstate highways.  [[Interstate 495 (Massachusetts)|Interstate 495]] runs from west to east through town, ending at [[Interstate 95]] just over the Salisbury town line.  It has two exits in town, Exit 54 at [[Massachusetts Route 150]] (which lies entirely within Amesbury, and leads to [[New Hampshire Route 150]]) and Exit 55 at [[Massachusetts Route 110]], which also provides the town's only direct access to [[Interstate 95 in Massachusetts|Interstate 95]] at Exit 58.  I-95 crosses the southeast corner of town, entering along the [[John Greenleaf Whittier]] Memorial Bridge, a steel through-truss bridge crossing the Merrimack River.  The Whittier Memorial Bridge lies just west of the town's only other bridges across the Merrimack, the Derek S. Hines Memorial Bridge, which connects Amesbury to Deer Island (which is still part of Amesbury), and the [[Chain Bridge (Massachusetts)|Chain Bridge]], the only [[suspension bridge]] in Massachusetts, which spans from Deer Island to Newburyport.  The current version was built in 1909, but was predated by the 1810 suspension bridge, one of the oldest suspension bridges in the country.  The Chain Bridge and its counterparts over the years have been the main entryways into town across the Merrimack, and until the building of the Newburyport Turnpike Bridge, it was the easternmost bridge on the Merrimack River.\n\n[[Merrimack Valley Regional Transit Authority|MVRTA]] provides bus service in Amesbury. Route 51 connects to the [[Haverhill (Amtrak station)|Haverhill train station]]. Route 54 connects to [[Newburyport (MBTA station)|Newburyport train station]].\n\n{{Historical populations\n|type= USA\n|align= right\n|width= 17em\n|1840|2471\n|1850|3143\n|1860|3877\n|1870|5581\n|1880|3355\n|1890|9798\n|1900|9473\n|1910|9894\n|1920|10036\n|1930|11899\n|1940|10862\n|1950|10851\n|1960|10787\n|1970|11388\n|1980|13971\n|1990|14997\n|2000|16450\n|2010|16283\n|2018|17569\n|source=<center>U.S. Decennial Census<ref name=\"DecennialCensus\">{{cite web |url=https://www.census.gov/prod/www/decennial.html |title=Census of Population and Housing |publisher=Census.gov |accessdate=June 4, 2015 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150426102944/http://www.census.gov/prod/www/decennial.html |archivedate=April 26, 2015 }}</ref></center>\n|footnote=* population estimate. {{Historical populations/Massachusetts municipalities references}}\n}}\n\n==Demographics==\n{{See also|List of Massachusetts locations by per capita income}}\n[[Image:Main Street from Market Square, Amesbury, MA.jpg|thumb|left|Main Street from Market Square in 1911]]\n[[File:Lowell's Boat Shop, Amesbury MA.jpg|thumb|right|<center>Lowell's Boat Shop</center>]]\nAs of the [[census]] of 2000, there were 16,450 people, 6,380 households, and 4,229 families residing in the city.<ref name=census2000>[http://factfinder.census.gov/servlet/GCTTable?_bm=y&-geo_id=04000US25&-_box_head_nbr=GCT-PH1&-ds_name=DEC_2000_SF1_U&-format=ST-7 Census 2000] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100727061223/http://factfinder.census.gov/servlet/GCTTable?_bm=y&-geo_id=04000US25&-_box_head_nbr=GCT-PH1&-ds_name=DEC_2000_SF1_U&-format=ST-7 |date=July 27, 2010 }}</ref> The [[population density]] was 1,326.3 people per square mile (512.2/km\u00b2).

In the late 19th and early 20th century most major denominations started overseas missionary activity.  The \"[[Mainline Protestant]]\" denominations promoted the \"[[Social Gospel]]\" in the early 20th century, calling on Americans to reform their society; the demand for [[Prohibition in the United States|prohibition of liquor]] was especially strong. After 1970, the mainline denominations (such as Methodists, Presbyterians and Episcopalians) lost membership and influence. The more conservative [[Evangelicalism|evangelical]], [[Christian fundamentalism|fundamentalist]], and [[Charismatic Christianity|charismatic]] denominations (such as the Southern Baptists) grew rapidly until the 1990s and helped form the [[Christian right|Religious Right]] in politics. The nation had a Catholic population from its founding, and as it expanded into areas that had been part of the Spanish and French empires, that population increased substantially.  Immigration from Catholic countries increased Catholic diversity in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. The Catholic Church has been the largest religious organization in the United States since at least the turn of the twentieth century.\n\nAs Western Europe secularized in the late 20th century, the Americans largely resisted the trend, so that by the 21st century the US was one of the most strongly Christian of all major nations. Religiously based moral positions on issues such as abortion and homosexuality played a hotly debated [[religion and politics in the United States|role in American politics]].\n\n==Demographics==\nThe [[U.S. census]] has never asked Americans directly about their religion  or religious beliefs, but it did compile statistics from each denomination starting in 1945.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/prod/www/religion.htm |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/19990508145129/http://www.census.gov/prod/www/religion.htm |url-status=dead |archive-date=1999-05-08 |title=Religion - Publications - US Census Bureau |publisher=Census.gov |accessdate=2012-09-17 }}</ref>\n\nFinke and Stark conducted a statistical analysis of the official census data  after 1850, and Atlas for 1776, to estimate the number of Americans who were adherents to a specific denomination.

Traditional Native American ceremonial ways can vary widely, and are based on the differing histories and beliefs of individual tribes, clans and bands. Early European explorers describe individual [[tribe (Native American)|Native American tribes]] and even small bands as each having their own religious practices. Theology may be [[Monotheism|monotheistic]], [[Polytheism|polytheistic]], [[Henotheism|henotheistic]], [[Animism|animistic]], or some combination thereof. Traditional beliefs are usually passed down in the forms of oral histories, stories, allegories and principles, and rely on face to face teaching in one's family and community.<ref>{{cite book|author=\u00c5ke Hultkrantz|title=The Religions of the American Indians|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Zo9nzMQLBEIC|year=1981|publisher=University of California Press|pages=1\u2013156|isbn=9780520042391}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Ten-sq\u00faat-a-way.jpg|thumb|right|175px|Tenskwatawa, by [[George Catlin]].]]\n\nFrom time to time important religious leaders organized revivals. In Indiana in 1805, [[Tenskwatawa]]  (called the Shanee Prophet by Americans) led a religious revival following a smallpox epidemic and a series of witch-hunts. His beliefs were based on the earlier teachings of the [[Lenape]] prophets, [[Scattamek]] and [[Neolin]], who predicted a coming apocalypse that would destroy the European-American settlers.<ref>Adam Jortner, ''The Gods of Prophetstown: The Battle of Tippecanoe and the Holy War for the American Frontier'' (2011)</ref>  Tenskwatawa urged the tribes to reject the ways of the Americans: to give up firearms, liquor, American style clothing, to pay traders only half the value of their debts, and to refrain from ceding any more lands to the United States. The revival led to warfare led by his brother [[Tecumseh]] against the white settlers.<ref>Rachel Buff, \"Tecumseh and Tenskwatawa: Myth, Historiography and Popular Memory.\" ''Historical Reflections/R\u00e9flexions Historiques'' (1995): 277\u2013299.</ref>\n\nNative Americans were the target of extensive Christian missionary activity. Catholics launched [[Jesuit Missions amongst the Huron]] and the [[Spanish missions in California]]) and various Protestant denominations.  Numerous Protestant denominations were active.

Their position was opposed by the ruling class by the 1620s, which insisted that the Puritans conform to Anglican religious practices. Puritans in England were threatened as England verged on civil war.\n\nBeginning in 1630 and for the decade as many as 20,000 Puritans emigrated to America from England. Most settled in New England, but some went as far as the West Indies. Some went back to England during the English Civil War 1642-1646 and the Commonwealth.  Theologically, the Puritans were \"non-separating [[Congregational church|Congregationalists]].\" Unlike the Pilgrims, who came to Massachusetts in 1620, the Puritans believed that the Church of England was a true church, though in need of major reforms. Every New England Congregational church was considered an independent entity, beholden to no hierarchy. There were no bishops. The membership was composed, at least initially, of men and women who had undergone a conversion experience and could prove it to other members.\n\n===Persecution in America===\n[[Image:Roger Williams statue by Franklin Simmons.jpg|thumb|right|150px|[[Roger Williams (theologian)|Roger Williams]] was expelled from the [[Massachusetts Bay Colony]] in 1636 for advocating [[religious liberty]].]]\nAlthough they were victims of religious persecution in Europe, the Puritans supported the theory that sanctioned it: the need for uniformity of religion in the state.\n\nOnce in control in New England, they sought to break \"the very neck of Schism and vile opinions.\" The \"business\" of the first settlers, a Puritan minister recalled in 1681, \"was not Toleration, but [they] were professed enemies of it.\"<ref>{{cite book |title=The Puritans: A Sourcebook of Their Writings|page=185|author=Thomas Herbert Johnson}}</ref> Puritans expelled dissenters from their colonies, a fate that in 1636 befell Roger Williams and in 1638 [[Anne Hutchinson]], America's first major female religious leader.\n\nThose who defied the Puritans by persistently returning to their jurisdictions risked [[capital punishment]], a penalty imposed on the [[Boston martyrs]], four [[Quaker]]s, between 1659 and 1661. Reflecting on the 17th century's intolerance, Thomas Jefferson was unwilling to concede to Virginians any moral superiority to the Puritans. Beginning in 1659, Virginia enacted anti-Quaker laws, including the death penalty for refractory Quakers. Jefferson surmised that \"if no capital execution took place here, as did in New England, it was not owing to the moderation of the church, or the spirit of the legislature.\"<ref>{{cite book |url=https://archive.org/details/unset0000unse_s5t3 |url-access=registration |page=[https://archive.org/details/unset0000unse_s5t3/page/365 365] |title=A brief guide to beliefs: ideas, theologies, mysteries, and movements |last=Edwards |first=Linda |location=Westminster|publisher= John Knox Press |year=2001 |isbn=978-0-664-22259-8}}</ref>\n\n====Founding of Rhode Island====\nExpelled from Massachusetts in the winter in 1636, former Puritan leader Roger Williams issued an impassioned plea for freedom of conscience.

Jones formulated the first theory of the origins and essence of Quakerism as fundamentally \"mystical\" in his introduction to William Braithwaite's history of Quakerism [Jones based his introduction on an earlier exploration of the history of Christian mysticism, Studies in Mystical Religion, one of a handful of pioneering works in that  field in The early Twentieth century (1909). A few years later he expanded his study with Spiritual Reformers of the Sixteenth and Seventeenth Centuries (1914)] (Braithwaite, 1912). ln 1921, he emphatically reaffirmed his thesis: \"No other large, organized, historically continuous body of Christians has yet existed which has been so fundamentally mystical, both in theory and practice, as the Society of Friends ... \" (Jones, 190 I, xiii). For over 25 years, Jones' claim seemed too accurate to question. But in 1955 a major shift in Quaker studies occurred when Hugh L. Doncaster claimed that new scholarship viewed Quakerism in another light. [See L. Hugh Doncaster, \"Forward to the Second Edition,\" in Wm. C. Braithwaite's The Beginnings of Quakerism, ed. Henry J. Cadbury (1955).] The paradigm shift had been set in motion with the publication of Geoffrey F. Nuttall's work, The Holy Spirit in Puritan Faith and Experience, in 1946 (revised 1992). Nuttall, a non-Quaker historian, supplanted .Jones' mystical theory with a new theory of Quakers as radical Puritans. According to NuttalI, George Fox and the Quakers, \"... who in the exclusive sense are not puritans but the puritans' fiercest foes, ... repeat, extend, and fuse so much of what is held by the radical, Separatist party within Puritanism, that they cannot be denied the name or excluded from consideration.\"}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/holyspiritinpuri0000nutt|url-access=registration|title=The Holy Spirit in Puritan Faith and Experience|last=Nuttall|first=Geoffrey F.|date=1992-07-15|publisher=University of Chicago Press|isbn=9780226609416|location=|pages=[https://archive.org/details/holyspiritinpuri0000nutt/page/13 13]|language=en}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|last=Durnbaugh|first=Donald F.|date=2012-04-04|title=Baptists and Quakers\u2014Left Wing Puritans?|journal=Quaker History|volume=62|issue=2|pages=67\u201382|doi=10.1353/qkh.1973.0005|issn=1934-1504}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|last=Horle|first=Craig W.|date=1976-01-01|title=Quakers and Baptists 1647\u20131660|journal=Baptist Quarterly|volume=26|issue=8|pages=344\u2013362|doi=10.1080/0005576X.1976.11751464|issn=0005-576X}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|last=Maclear|first=James F.|date=1950-12-01|title=Quakerism and the end of the Interregnum: a Chapter in the Domestication of Radical Puritanism|journal=Church History|volume=19|issue=4|pages=240\u2013270|doi=10.2307/3161160|issn=1755-2613|jstor=3161160}}</ref> Historians in support of the Puritan classification of Quakers notice that Quakers stretch the sober deportment of the Puritans into a glorification of \"plainness.\"<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=p0jndZXU-34C&pg=PA14&lpg=PA14&dq=sober+deportment+of+the+Puritans+into+a+glorification+of+%22plainness.%22#v=onepage&q=sober%20deportment%20of%20the%20Puritans%20into%20a%20glorification%20of%20%22plainness.%22&f=false|title=America on the Cusp of God's Grace: The Biblical Connection to the Stars and Stripes|last=Hurst|first=Dennis G.|date=2010-11-12|publisher=iUniverse|isbn=9781450269551|location=|pages=14|language=en|quote=They stretched the sober deportment of the Puritans into a glorification of \"plainness.\" Theologically, they expanded the Puritan concept of a church of individuals ...}}</ref> Theologically, they expanded the Puritan concept of a church of individuals regenerated by the [[Holy Spirit]] to the idea of the indwelling of the Spirit or the \"Light of Christ\" in every person.\n\nSuch teaching struck many of the Quakers' contemporaries as dangerous [[heresy]]. Quakers were severely persecuted in England for daring to deviate so far from orthodox Christianity. By 1680, 10,000 Quakers had been imprisoned in England and 243 had died of torture and mistreatment in jail.\n\nThis reign of terror impelled Friends to seek refuge in Rhode Island in the 1670s, where they soon became well entrenched. In 1681, when Quaker leader [[William Penn]] parlayed a debt owed by [[Charles II of England|Charles II]] to his father into a charter for the province of [[Pennsylvania]], many more Quakers were prepared to grasp the opportunity to live in a land where they might worship freely. By 1685, as many as 8,000 Quakers had come to Pennsylvania from England, Wales, and Ireland.{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}}  Although the Quakers may have resembled the Puritans in some religious beliefs and practices, they differed with them over the necessity of compelling [[religious uniformity]] in society.\n\n===Pennsylvania Germans===\nDuring the main years of German emigration to Pennsylvania in the mid-18th century, most of the emigrants were Lutherans, Reformed, or members of small sects\u2014[[Mennonite]]s, [[Amish]], [[Schwarzenau Brethren|Dunkers]], [[Moravian Church|Moravians]] and [[Schwenkfelders]]. The great majority became farmers.<ref>Joseph E. Illick, ''Colonial Pennsylvania: A History'' (1976)</ref>\n\nThe colony was owned by [[William Penn]], a leading Quaker, and his agents encouraged German emigration to Pennsylvania by circulating promotional literature touting the economic advantages of Pennsylvania as well as the religious liberty available there.

Driven by \"the sacred duty of finding a refuge for his Roman Catholic brethren,\" [[George Calvert]] obtained a charter from Charles I in 1632 for the territory between Pennsylvania and Virginia.<ref>{{cite book |author=Charles McLean Andrews|title=The colonial period of American history|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CTN2AAAAMAAJ|year=1936|publisher=Yale University Press|page=279}}</ref>  This Maryland charter offered no guidelines on religion, although it was assumed that Catholics would not be molested in the new colony.  His son [[Cecilius Calvert, 2nd Baron Baltimore|Lord Baltimore]], was a Catholic who inherited the grant for Maryland from his father and was in charge 1630\u201345. In 1634, Lord Baltimore's two ships, the ''Ark'' and the ''Dove'', sailed with the first 200 settlers to Maryland. They included two Catholic priests. Lord Baltimore assumed that religion was a private matter. He rejected the need for an established church, guaranteed liberty of conscience to all Christians, and embraced pluralism.<ref>John D. Krugler, \"The Calvert Vision: A New Model for Church-State Relations,\" ''Maryland Historical Magazine,'' (2004) 99#3 pp. 268\u2013285</ref>\n\nCatholic fortunes fluctuated in Maryland during the rest of the 17th century, as they became an increasingly smaller minority of the population. After the [[Glorious Revolution of 1689]] in England, the Church of England was legally established in the colony and English penal laws, which deprived Catholics of the right to vote, hold office, or worship publicly, were enforced.  Maryland's first state constitution in 1776 restored the freedom of religion.<ref>Beatriz Betancourt Hardy, \"Roman Catholics, Not Papists: Catholic Identity in Maryland, 1689\u20131776,\" ''Maryland Historical Magazine'' (1997) 92#2 pp. 138\u2013161</ref>\n\n===Virginia and the Church of England===\n{{main article|Religion in early Virginia|Episcopal Diocese of Virginia#History}}\nVirginia was the largest, most populous and most important colony. The Church of England was legally established; the bishop of London who had oversight of Anglican in the colonies made it a favorite missionary target and sent in 22 clergymen (in priestly orders) by 1624.  In practice, establishment meant that local taxes were funneled through the local parish to handle the needs of local government, such as roads and poor relief, in addition to the salary of the minister.  There was never a bishop in colonial Virginia, and in practice the local vestry consisted of laymen who controlled the parish and handled local taxes, roads and poor relief.<ref>Edward L.

Blosser, \"Irreverent Empire: Anglican Inattention in an Atlantic World,\" ''Church History,'' Sept 2008, Vol. 77 Issue 3, pp. 596\u2013628</ref> The lack of towns meant the church had to serve scattered settlements, while the acute shortage of trained ministers meant that piety was hard to practice outside the home. Some ministers solved their problems by encouraging parishioners to become devout at home, using the ''Book of Common Prayer'' for private prayer and devotion (rather than the Bible). This allowed devout Anglicans to lead an active and sincere religious life apart from the unsatisfactory formal church services. However, the stress on private devotion weakened the need for a bishop or a large institutional church of the sort Blair wanted. The stress on personal piety opened the way for the [[First Great Awakening]], which pulled people away from the established church.<ref>Edward L. Bond, \"Anglican theology and devotion in James Blair's Virginia, 1685\u20131743,\" ''Virginia Magazine of History and Biography,'' 1996, Vol. 104 Issue 3, pp. 313\u201340</ref>\n\nEspecially in the back country, most families had no religious affiliation whatsoever and their low moral standards were shocking to proper Englishmen<ref name=\"Charles Woodmason 1969\">Charles Woodmason, ''The Carolina Backcountry on the Eve of the Revolution: The Journal and Other Writings of Charles Woodmason, Anglican Itinerant'' ed. by Richard J.

It resulted from powerful preaching that deeply affected listeners (already church members) with a deep sense of personal guilt and salvation by Christ.  Pulling away from ritual and ceremony, the Great Awakening made relationship with God intensely personal to the average person by creating a deep sense of spiritual guilt, forgiveness, redemption and peace. Historian Sydney E. Ahlstrom sees it as part of a \"great international Protestant upheaval\" that also created [[Pietism]] in Germany, the [[Evangelicalism|Evangelical Revival]] and [[Methodism]] in England.<ref>Sydney E. Armstrong, ''A Religious History of the American People''. (1972) p. 263</ref> It brought Christianity to the slaves and was an apocalyptic event in [[New England]] that challenged established church authority. It resulted in division between the new revivalists and the old traditionalists who insisted on ritual and doctrine.\nThe new style of sermons and the way people practiced their faith breathed new life into Christian faith in America. People became passionately and emotionally involved in their relationship with God, rather than passively listening to intellectual discourse in a detached manner. Ministers who used this new style of preaching were generally called \"new lights\", while the preachers of old were called \"old lights\". People began to study the [[Bible]] at home, which effectively decentralized the means of informing the public on religious manners and was akin to the individualistic trends present in Europe during the [[Protestant Reformation]].<ref name=\"Thomas S. Kidd 2007\"/>\n\nThe fundamental premise of evangelicalism is the conversion of individuals from a state of sin to a \"[[Born again Christianity|new birth]]\" through preaching of the Bible leading to [[Salvation by faith|faith]]. The First Great Awakening led to changes in American colonial society. In New England, the Great Awakening was influential among many [[Congregational church|Congregationalists]].  In the Middle and Southern colonies, especially in the \"Backcountry\" regions, the Awakening was influential among [[Presbyterianism|Presbyterians]]. In the South [[Baptist]] and [[Methodist]] preachers converted both whites and enslaved blacks.<ref>Thomas S. Kidd, ''The Great Awakening: The Roots of Evangelical Christianity in Colonial America'' (2009)</ref>\n\nDuring the first decades of the 18th century, in the [[Connecticut River Valley]], a series of local \"awakenings\" began in the Congregational church with ministers including [[Jonathan Edwards (theologian)|Jonathan Edwards]]. The first new Congregational Church in the Massachusetts Colony during the great awakening period, was in 1731 at [[Uxbridge, MA|Uxbridge]] and called the Rev. [[Nathan Webb]] as its Pastor. By the 1730s, they had spread into what was interpreted as a general outpouring of the [[Holy Spirit (Christianity)|Spirit]] that bathed the American colonies, England, Wales, and Scotland.\n\nIn mass open-air revivals powerful preachers like [[George Whitefield]] brought thousands of souls to the [[Born again (Christianity)|new birth]]. The Great Awakening, which had spent its force in New England by the mid-1740s, split the Congregational and Presbyterian churches into supporters\u2014called \"[[New Lights]]\" and \"[[The Old Side-New Side Controversy|New Side]]\"\u2014and opponents\u2014the \"Old Lights\" and \"Old Side.\" Many New England New Lights became [[Separate Baptists]]. Largely through the efforts of a charismatic preacher from New England named [[Shubal Stearns]] and paralleled by the New Side Presbyterians (who were eventually reunited on their own terms with the Old Side), they carried the Great Awakening into the southern colonies, igniting a series of the revivals that lasted well into the 19th century.<ref name=\"LOC Religion 18th century\"/>\n\nThe supporters of the Awakening and its evangelical thrust\u2014[[Presbyterian]]s, Baptists and [[Methodist]]s\u2014became the largest American Protestant denominations by the first decades of the 19th century. Opponents of the Awakening or those split by it\u2014Anglicans, Quakers, and Congregationalists\u2014were left behind.\n\nUnlike the [[Second Great Awakening]] that began about 1800 and which reached out to the unchurched, the First Great Awakening focused on people who were already church members. It changed their rituals, their piety, and their self-awareness.<ref name=\"Thomas S. Kidd 2007\">Thomas S.

Baptist services emphasized emotion; the only ritual,  baptism, involved immersion (not sprinkling as in the Anglican tradition) of adults only. Opposed to the low moral standards prevalent around them, the Baptists strictly enforced their own high standards of personal morality, and especially opposed sexual misconduct, heavy drinking, frivolous spending, missing services, cursing, and revelry.  Church trials took place frequently, and Baptist churches expelled members who did not submit to discipline.<ref>\n{{cite book\n| last1                 = Spangler\n| first1                = Jewel L.\n| title                 = Virginians Reborn: Anglican Monopoly, Evangelical Dissent, and the Rise of the Baptists in the Late Eighteenth Century\n| url                   = https://books.google.com/books?id=R0RVN0vx50gC\n| location              = Charlottesville\n| publisher             = University of Virginia Press\n| date      = 2008\n| page                  = \n| isbn                  = 9780813926797\n}}\n</ref>\n\nMany historians have debated the implications of the religious rivalries for the coming of the [[American Revolution]] of 1765\u20131783.<ref>Bonomi, ''Under the Cope of Heaven: Religion, Society, and Politics in Colonial America'' (1988) pp. 187\u2013222 and 269\u201378, cites over forty scholars.</ref>  The Baptist farmers did introduce a new egalitarian ethic that largely displaced the semi-aristocratic ethic of the Anglican planters. However, both groups supported the Revolution.  There was a sharp contrast between the austerity of the plain-living Baptists and the opulence of the Anglican planters, who controlled local government. Baptist church discipline, mistaken by the gentry for radicalism, served to ameliorate disorder. The struggle for religious toleration erupted and played out during the [[American Revolution]], as the Baptists worked to disestablish the Anglican church.<ref>Rhys Isaac, \"Evangelical Revolt: The Nature of the Baptists' Challenge to the Traditional Order in Virginia, 1765 to 1775,\" ''William and Mary Quarterly'' 1974 31(3): 345\u2013368</ref>\n\nBaptists, [[German American|German Lutherans]] and Presbyterians funded their own ministers, and favored disestablishment of the Anglican church.\n\n====Methodists====\nMethodist missionaries were also active in the late colonial period. From 1776 to 1815 Methodist Bishop [[Francis Asbury]] made 42 trips into the western parts to visit Methodist congregations. In the 1780s itinerant Methodist preachers carried copies of an anti-slavery petition in their saddlebags throughout the state, calling for an end to slavery. At the same time, counter-petitions were circulated. The petitions were presented to the Assembly; they were debated, but no legislative action was taken, and after 1800 there was less and less religious opposition to slavery.<ref>Richard K.

Religious practice suffered in certain places because of the absence of ministers and the destruction of churches.\n\n===Church of England===\n{{main article|Episcopal Church (United States)}}\nThe American Revolution inflicted deeper wounds on the [[Church of England]] in America than on any other denomination because the [[English monarch]] was the head of the church. Church of England priests, at their ordination, swore allegiance to the [[British crown]].\n\nThe [[Book of Common Prayer]] offered prayers for the monarch, beseeching God \"to be his defender and keeper, giving him victory over all his enemies,\" who in 1776 were American soldiers as well as friends and neighbors of American parishioners of the Church of England. Loyalty to the church and to its head could be construed as treason to the American cause.\n\nPatriotic American members of the Church of England, loathing to discard so fundamental a component of their faith as The Book of Common Prayer, revised it to conform to the political realities.  After the [[Treaty of Paris (1783)]] in which Great Britain  formally recognized American independence, Anglicans were left without leadership or a formal institution. Samuel Seabury was consecrated bishop by the Scottish Episcopal Church in 1784. He resided in New York. After the requirement to take an Oath of Allegiance to the Crown two Americans were consecrated bishops in London in 1786 for Virginia and Pennsylvania. The Protestant [[Episcopal Church of the United States]] was created in 1787 as an autonomous in communion with the Church of England. It adopted a modified Book of Common Prayer which most notably used the Scottish Canon (Eucharistic Prayer). This consecration prayer moved the eucharistic doctrine of the American Church much closer to the Roman Catholic and Orthodox teachings and virtually undid Cranmer's rejection of the eucharist as a material sacrifice offered to God (which had been the accepted theology from the early 3rd century).\n\n==The new nation==\nHistorians in recent decades have debated the nature of American religiosity in the early 19th century, focusing on issues of secularism, deism, traditional religious practices, and newly emerging evangelical forms based on the [[Great Awakening]].<ref>Christopher Grasso, \"The Religious and the Secular in the Early American Republic,\" ''Journal of the Early Republic'' (Summer 2016) 36#2 pp. 359\u2013388.</ref><ref>Craig Calhoun, Mark Juergensmeyer, and Jonathan VanAntwerpen, eds.

However, the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution]], adopted in 1791, has played a central role in defining the relationship of the federal government to the free exercise of religion, and to the prohibition establishment of an official church. Its policies were extended to cover state governments in the 1940s.  The government is not allowed to hinder the free exercise of religion, and is not allowed to sponsor any particular religion through taxation of favors.<ref>James S.

The treaty was a routine diplomatic agreement but has attracted later attention because the English version included a clause about religion in the United States. \n<blockquote>As the Government of the United States of America is not, in any sense, founded on the Christian religion,\u2014as it has in itself no character of enmity against the laws, religion, or tranquility, of Mussulmen <nowiki>[</nowiki>[[Muslims]]<nowiki>]</nowiki>,\u2014and as the said States never entered into any war or act of hostility against any Mahometan <nowiki>[</nowiki>[[Mohammedan]]<nowiki>]</nowiki> nation, it is declared by the parties that no pretext arising from religious opinions shall ever produce an interruption of the harmony existing between the two countries.</blockquote>\n\nAccording to [[Franklin T. Lambert|Frank Lambert]], Professor of History at [[Purdue University]], the assurances in Article 11 were \"intended to allay the fears of the Muslim state by insisting that religion would not govern how the treaty was interpreted and enforced.  John Adams and the Senate made clear that the pact was between two sovereign states, not between two religious powers.\" Lambert writes, \n:\"By their actions, the Founding Fathers made clear that their primary concern was religious freedom, not the advancement of a state religion. Individuals, not the government, would define religious faith and practice in the United States. Thus the Founders ensured that in no official sense would America be a Christian Republic. Ten years after the Constitutional Convention ended its work, the country assured the world that the United States was a secular state, and that its negotiations would adhere to the rule of law, not the dictates of the Christian faith. The assurances were contained in the Treaty of Tripoli of 1797 and were intended to allay the fears of the Muslim state by insisting that religion would not govern how the treaty was interpreted and enforced. John Adams and the Senate made clear that the pact was between two sovereign states, not between two religious powers\".<ref>{{cite book|author=Frank Lambert|title=The Founding Fathers and the Place of Religion in America|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4CHIomb78VgC|year=2006|publisher=Princeton University Press|isbn=978-0-691-12602-9|page=[https://books.google.com/books?id=4CHIomb78VgC&pg=PA11 11]}}</ref>\n\nNotwithstanding the clear separation of government and religion, the predominant cultural and social nature of the nation did become strongly Christian.

The Methodists and Baptists were the most active at sponsoring revivals. The number of Methodist church members grew from 58,000 in 1790 to 258,000 in 1820 and 1,661,000 in 1860. Over 70 years Methodist membership grew by a factor of 28.6 times when the total national population grew by a factor of eight times.<ref>US Bureau of the Census, ''Historical Statistics of the United States: From: the Colonial Times to the Present'' (1976) pp. 8, 392</ref>\n\nIt made [[evangelicalism]] one of the dominant forces in American religion. Balmer explains that:\n:\"Evangelicalism itself, I believe, is quintessentially North American phenomenon, deriving as it did from the confluence of Pietism, Presbyterianism, and the vestiges of Puritanism. Evangelicalism picked up the peculiar characteristics from each strain \u2013 warmhearted spirituality from the Pietists (for instance), doctrinal precisionism from the Presbyterians, and individualistic introspection from the Puritans \u2013 even as the North American context itself has profoundly shaped the various manifestations of evangelicalism.: fundamentalism, neo-evangelicalism, the holiness movement, Pentecostalism, the charismatic movement, and various forms of African-American and Hispanic evangelicalism.\"<ref>{{cite book|author=Randall Balmer|title=The Encyclopedia of Evangelicalism|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=syUupeVJOz4C&pg=PR8|year=2002|publisher=Westminster John Knox Press|pages=vii\u2013viii|isbn=9780664224097}}</ref>\n\n===Second Great Awakening===\n[[File:1839-meth.jpg|thumb|right|300px|1839 Methodist camp meeting]]\n{{main article|Second Great Awakening}}\n{{see also|Camp meeting|Revival meeting}}\n\nIn 1800, major revivals began that spread across the nation: the decorous [[Second Great Awakening]] in New England and the exuberant [[Great Revival]] in [[Cane Ridge, Kentucky|Cane Ridge]], [[Kentucky]]. The principal religious innovation produced by the Kentucky revivals was the [[camp meeting]].\n\nThe revivals at first were organized by Presbyterian ministers who modeled them after the extended outdoor [[communion seasons]], used by the Presbyterian Church in Scotland, which frequently produced emotional, demonstrative displays of religious conviction. In Kentucky, the pioneers loaded their families and provisions into their wagons and drove to the Presbyterian meetings, where they pitched tents and settled in for several days.\n\nWhen assembled in a field or at the edge of a forest for a prolonged religious meeting, the participants transformed the site into a camp meeting. The religious revivals that swept the Kentucky camp meetings were so intense and created such gusts of emotion that their original sponsors, the Presbyterians, as well the Baptists, soon repudiated them. The Methodists, however, adopted and eventually domesticated camp meetings and introduced them into the eastern states, where for decades they were one of the evangelical signatures of the denomination.\n\nThe Second Great Awakening (1800\u20131830s), unlike the first, focused on the unchurched and sought to instill in them a deep sense of personal salvation as experienced in revival meetings. The great revival quickly spread throughout Kentucky, Tennessee and southern Ohio. Each denomination had assets that allowed it to thrive on the frontier. The Methodists had an efficient organization that depended on ministers known as [[circuit rider (religious)|circuit rider]]s, who sought out people in remote frontier locations. The circuit riders came from among the common people, which helped them establish rapport with the frontier families they hoped to convert.\n\nThe Second Great Awakening exercised a profound impact on American religious history.  By 1859 evangelicalism emerged as a kind of national church or national religion and was the grand absorbing theme of American religious life.  The greatest gains were made by the very well organized Methodists. [[Francis Asbury]] (1745\u20131816) led the [[United Methodist Church|American Methodist movement]] as one of the most prominent religious leaders of the young republic.  Traveling throughout the eastern seaboard, [[Methodism]] grew quickly under Asbury's leadership into the nation's largest and most widespread denomination.  The numerical strength of the Baptists and Methodists rose relative to that of the denominations dominant in the colonial period\u2014the [[Anglicans]], Presbyterians, [[Congregational church|Congregationalists]], and [[Reformed churches|Reformed]]. Efforts to apply Christian teaching to the resolution of social problems presaged the [[Social Gospel]] of the late 19th century.  It also sparked the beginnings of groups such as the [[Mormons]], the [[Restoration Movement]] and the [[Holiness movement]].\n\n===Third Great Awakening===\n{{main article|Third Great Awakening}}\nThe Third Great Awakening was a period of religious activism in American history from the late 1850s to the 20th century. It affected pietistic Protestant denominations and had a strong sense of social activism.  It gathered strength from the [[postmillennial]] theology that the [[Second Coming]] of Christ would come after mankind had reformed the entire earth.  The [[Social Gospel]] Movement gained its force from the Awakening, as did the worldwide missionary movement.  New groupings emerged, such as the [[Holiness movement]] and [[Church of the Nazarene|Nazarene]] movements, and [[Christian Science]].<ref>Robert William Fogel, ''The Fourth Great Awakening & the Future of Egalitarianism'' (2000)</ref>\n\nThe Protestant mainline churches were growing rapidly in numbers, wealth and educational levels, throwing off their frontier beginnings and become centered in towns and cities. Intellectuals and writers such as [[Josiah Strong]] advocated a muscular Christianity with systematic outreach to the unchurched in America and around the globe.  Others built colleges and universities to train the next generation. Each denomination supported active missionary societies, and made the role of missionary one of high prestige.  The great majority of pietistic mainline Protestants (in the North) supported the [[History of the Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]], and urged it to endorse prohibition and social reforms.<ref>Paul Kleppner, ''The Third Electoral System, 1853\u20131892: Parties, Voters, and Political Cultures'' (2009)</ref><ref>Richard Jensen, ''The Winning of the Midwest'' (1971) p. 171</ref> See [[Third Party System]]\n\nThe awakening in numerous cities in 1858 was interrupted by the [[American Civil War]].

Changing social conditions forced a shift from the gospel of wealth to the Social Gospel. the \"[[Gospel of wealth]]\" was an appeal to rich Christians to share their wealth in philanthropy, while the Social Gospel called on ministers to take the lead themselves in eliminating social evils. The second challenge emerged from modern science, where evolutionary Darwinism generated quite different religious responses in terms of biblical authoritarianism, romantic liberalism and scientific modernism. Protestantism gradually abandoned its emphasis on individual salvation and laissez-faire individualism; although this tendency was resisted by fundamentalists who sought, often blindly, to cling to the theological foundations of Christianity to which the denominations have begun again to return.<ref>Sidney E.  Mead, \"American Protestantism since the Civil War. II. From Americanism to Christianity.\" ''Journal of Religion'' 36.2 (1956): 67-89.

According to historian R. Laurence Moore, Christian Scientists, Pentecostals, Jehovah Witnesses and Catholics responded to hostile comments by sensing themselves as persecuted Americans on the margins of society, which made them cling tightly to their status as full citizens.. <ref>R. Laurence Moore, '' Religious Outsiders and the Making of Americans'' (1986)</ref>\n\n===The  South===\nHistorian [[Edward Ayers]] describes an impoverished South with a rich Spiritual life:\n: Religious faith and language appeared everywhere in the New South. It permeated public speech as well as private emotion. For many people, religion provided the measure of politics, the power behind law and reform, the reason to reach out to the poor and exploited, a pressure to cross racial boundaries. People viewed everything from courtship to child-rearing to their own deaths in religious terms. Even those filled with doubt or disdain could not escape the images, the assumptions, the power of faith.<ref> Edward Ayres, ''The Promise of the New South: Life After Reconstruction'' (1992), p 160. </ref>\nThe Baptists formed the largest grouping, for both Blacks and whites, with its loose networks of numerous small rural churches churches.  In second place for both races came the Methodists, with a hierarchical structure at the opposite end of the spectrum from the Baptists. Smaller fundamentalist groups that grew very large in the 20th century were starting to appear. Clusters of Roman Catholics appeared in the region's few cities, as well as southern Louisiana. Elite white Southerners, for the most part, were Episcopalians or Presbyterians. Across the region, ministers held high prestige positions, especially in the black community where they were typically political leaders as well. When the great majority Blacks were disenfranchised after 1890, the black preachers were still allowed to vote. Revivals were regular occurrences, attracting large crowds. It was usually the already converted who attended, so the number of new converts was relatively small but new or old, the all enjoyed the preaching and the socializing.<ref> Edward Ayres, ''The Promise of the New South'' (1992), pp  160. </ref><ref>Kenneth K.

The goal was to apply[[Christian ethics]] to [[social issue|social problem]]s, especially issues of [[social justice]] and  [[social evil]]s such as [[economic inequality]], [[poverty]], [[alcoholism]], [[crime]], [[Ethnic conflict|racial tensions]], [[slum]]s, unclean environment, [[child labor]], lack of [[labour unions|unionization]], poor schools, and the dangers of war.  Theologically, the Social Gospelers sought to put into practice the [[Lord's Prayer]]: \"Thy kingdom come, Thy will be done on earth as it is in heaven\".<ref>Cecelia Tichi, ''Civic Passions: Seven Who Launched Progressive America (and What They Teach Us). (2009) pp 205-239. [https://archive.org/details/civicpassionssev0000tich online]</ref> They typically were [[postmillennialism|postmillennialist]]; that is, they believed the [[Second Coming]] could not happen until humankind rid itself of [[social evil]]s by human effort. Social Gospel theologians rejected [[premillennialist]] theology, which held the [[Second Coming]] of Christ was imminent, and Christians should devote their energies to preparing for it rather than social issues. That perspective was strongest among fundamentalists and in the South. The Social Gospel was more popular among clergy than laity.  Its leaders were predominantly associated with the liberal wing of the [[progressive movement]], and most were [[Liberal Christianity|theologically liberal]]. Important leaders included [[Richard T. Ely]], [[Josiah Strong]], [[Washington Gladden]], and [[Walter Rauschenbusch]].  Many politicians came under its influence, notably [[William Jennings Bryan]] and [[Woodrow Wilson]]. The most controversial Social Gospel reform was  [[Prohibition in the United States|prohibition]], which was highly popular in rural areas \u2013 including the South \u2013 and unpopular in the larger cities where mainline Protestantism was weak among the electorate.<ref>Christopher H.

[[William Bell Riley]] took the initiative in the 1925 [[Scopes Trial]] by bringing in famed politician [[William Jennings Bryan]] as an assistant to the local prosecutor, Bryan drew national media attention to the trial. In the half century after the Scopes Trial, fundamentalists had little success in shaping government policy, and they were generally defeated in their efforts to reshape the [[Mainline Protestant|mainline denominations]], which refused to join fundamentalist attacks on evolution. Particularly after the Scopes Trial, liberals saw a division between Christians in favor of the teaching of evolution, whom they viewed as educated and tolerant, and Christians against evolution, whom they viewed as narrow-minded, tribal, obscurantist.<ref>David Goetz, \"The Monkey Trial\".

After Scopes was convicted, creationists throughout the United States sought similar antievolution laws for their states. They sought to ban evolution as a topic for study, or at least relegate it to the status of unproven theory perhaps taught alongside the biblical version of creation. Educators, scientists, and other distinguished laymen favored evolution. This struggle occurred later in the Southwest than in other US areas and persisted through the Sputnik era.<ref>George E.

Handy identifies a religious depression in the United States starting around 1925, that only grew worse during the economic depression which began in 1929. The identification of Protestantism with American culture undermined the religious messages. The fundamentalist churches said over expanded and were financially troubled. The mainstream churches were well enough financed in the late 1920s, but lost their self-confidence in terms of whether their social gospel was needed in an age of prosperity, especially since the great reform of prohibition was a failure. In terms of their network of international missions, the mainstream churches realized that the missions were a success in terms of opening modern schools and hospitals but a failure in terms of conversions. The leading theorist Daniel Fleming proclaimed that the continents for Christian outreach and Christian .conquest were no longer Africa and Asia, but rather, materialism, racial injustice, war and poverty. The number of missionaries from mainstream denominations began a steep decline.  By contrast, the evangelical and fundamentalist churches--never wedded to the social gospel-- escalated their efforts worldwide with a focus on conversion.<ref>William R.

Suddenly in 1932\u201333, the mainline churches lost one of their historic functions in distributing alms to the poor, and the national government took over that role without any religious dimension.  Handy argues that the deep self-doubt the religious revivals customary in times of economic depression was absent in the 1930s.  He concludes that Great Depression marked the end of the dominance of Protestantism in American life.<ref>Robert T.

Only a minority of religious leaders, typified by [[Reinhold Niebuhr]], paid serious attention to the threats to peace posed by Nazi Germany, Fascist Italy, or militaristic Japan.  After Pearl Harbor in December 1941, practically all the religious denominations gave some support to the war effort, such as providing chaplains. The pacifist churches, such as the Quakers and Mennonites were small but maintained their opposition to military service. Many young members, such as [[Richard Nixon]] voluntarily joining the military. Unlike in 1917\u20131918, the positions were generally respected by the government, which set up non-combat civilian roles for [[conscientious objectors]]. Typically, church members sent their sons into the military without protest, accepted shortages and rationing as a war necessity, purchased war bonds, working munitions industries, and prayed intensely for safe return and for victory. Church leaders, however, were much more cautious while holding fast to the ideals of peace, justice and humanitarianism, and sometimes criticizing military policies such as the bombing of enemy cities. They sponsored 10,000 military chaplains, and set up special ministries in and around military bases, focused not only on soldiers but their young wives who often followed them. The mainstream Protestant churches supported the \"[[Double V campaign]]\" of the black churches to achieve victory against the enemies abroad, and victory against racism on the home front. However, there was little religious protest against the incarceration of Japanese on the West Coast or against segregation of Blacks in the services. The intense moral outrage regarding the Holocaust largely appeared after the war ended, especially after 1960. Many church leaders supported studies of postwar peace proposals, typified by [[John Foster Dulles]], a leading Protestant layman and a leading adviser to top-level Republicans. The churches promoted strong support for European relief programs, especially through the United Nations.<ref> John  P.

They preach [[American exceptionalism]], oppose liberal scholars, and emphasize the Christian identity of many Founding Fathers.  critics argue that many of these Christian founders actually supported the separation of church and state and would not support the notion that they were trying to found a Christian nation.<ref>John Fea,  \"Using the Past to 'Save' Our Nation: The Debate over Christian America.\" ''OAH Magazine of History'' 27.1 (2013): 7-11.</ref><ref>John Fea, ''Was America Founded as a Christian Nation?

United States]]''  a Supreme Court decision in 1892  Justice [[David Josiah Brewer]] used the opportunity to present his personal views on the nation's religious base and concluded it was \"a Christian nation\". He later wrote and lectured widely on the topic, stressing that \"Christian nation\" was an informal designation and not a legal standard, :\n:[In] American life, as expressed by its laws, its business, its customs, and its society, we find everywhere a clear recognition of the same truth. Among other matters, note the following: the form of oath universally prevailing, concluding with an appeal to the Almighty; the custom of opening sessions of all deliberative bodies and most conventions with prayer; the prefatory words of all wills, \"In the name of God, amen\"; the laws respecting the observance of the Sabbath, with the general cessation of all secular business, and the closing of courts, legislatures, and other similar public assemblies on that day; the churches and church organizations which abound in every city, town, and hamlet; the multitude of charitable organizations existing everywhere under Christian auspices; the gigantic missionary associations, with general support, and aiming to establish Christian missions in every quarter of the globe. These, and many other matters which might be noticed, add a volume of unofficial declarations to the mass of organic utterances that this is a Christian nation....There is no dissonance in these declarations. There is a universal language pervading them all, having one meaning. They affirm and reaffirm that this is a religious nation. These are not individual sayings, declarations of private persons.

Conflicts between Mormons and territorial federal appointees flared, included the [[Runaway Officials of 1851]]; this eventually led to the small-scale [[Utah War]] of 1857\u20131858, after which Utah remained occupied by Federal troops until 1861.\n\nCongress passed the [[Morrill Anti-Bigamy Act]] of 1862 to curb the Mormon practice of [[polygamy]] in the territory, but President [[Abraham Lincoln]] did not enforce this law; instead Lincoln gave Brigham Young [[wiktionary:tacit|tacit]] permission to ignore the act in exchange for not becoming involved with the [[American Civil War]].<ref name= Zion-courts>{{citation |last1= Firmage |first1= Edwin Brown |last2= Mangrum |first2= Richard Collin |title= Zion in the courts |year= 2001 |publisher= University of Illinois Press |isbn= 978-0-252-06980-2 |page= 139 |url= https://books.google.com/?id=9AimifP2a-4C |quote= Having signed the Morrill Act, Abraham Lincoln reportedly compared the LDS Church to a log he had encountered as a farmer that was 'too hard to split, too wet to burn and too heavy to move, so we plow around it.

This law also revoked polygamists' right to vote, made them ineligible for jury service, and prohibited them from holding political office.  The subsequent 1887 [[Edmunds\u2013Tucker Act]] disincorporated the LDS Church and confiscated church assets. It also: required an anti-polygamy oath for prospective voters, jurors and public officials; mandated civil marriage licenses; disallowed [[spousal privilege]] to not testify in polygamy cases; disenfranchised women; replaced local judges with federally appointed judges; and removed local control of schools. After a [[Late Corporation of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints v. United States|1890 Supreme Court ruling]] found the Edmunds\u2013Tucker Act constitutional, and with most church leadership either in hiding or imprisoned, the church released the [[1890 Manifesto]] which advised church members against entering legally prohibited marriages. Dissenters moved to Canada or [[Mormon colonies in Mexico]], or into hiding in remote areas. With the polygamy issue resolved, church leaders were pardoned or had their sentences reduced, assets were restored to the church, and Utah was eventually granted statehood in 1896. After the [[Reed Smoot hearings]] began in 1904, a [[Second Manifesto]] was issued which specified that anyone entering into or solemnizing polygamous marriages would be excommunicated, and clarified that polygamy restrictions applied everywhere, and not just in the United States.<ref>Kathleen Flake, ''The Politics of American Religious Identity: The Seating of Senator Reed Smoot, Mormon Apostle'' (2004)</ref>\n\nThanks to worldwide [[Missionary (LDS Church)|missionary work]], the church grew from 7.7 million members worldwide in 1989 to 14 million in 2010.<ref>{{cite book|author=Matthew Bowman|title=The Mormon People: The Making of an American Faith|publisher=Random House|url=https://archive.org/details/mormonpeoplemaki00bowm_0|url-access=registration|year=2012|page=[https://archive.org/details/mormonpeoplemaki00bowm_0/page/218 218]|isbn=9780812983364}}</ref>\n\n===Jehovah's Witnesses===\n{{main article|History of Jehovah's Witnesses}}\n\n[[Jehovah's Witnesses]] comprise a fast-growing denomination that has kept itself separate from other Christian denominations. It began in 1872 with [[Charles Taze Russell]], but experienced a major schism in 1917 as [[Joseph Franklin Rutherford]] began his presidency. Rutherford gave new direction to the movement and renamed the movement \"Jehovah's witnesses\"<!--lower case \"w\" is correct--> in 1931.  The period from 1925 to 1933 saw many significant changes in doctrine. Attendance at their yearly [[Jehovah's Witnesses practices#Memorial of Christ's death|Memorial]] dropped from a high of 90,434 in 1925 to 63,146 in 1935.  Since 1950 growth has been very rapid.<ref>Stark et al., \"Why Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses Grow So Rapidly: A Theoretical Application,\"  [[Journal of Contemporary Religion]],'' Vol. 12, # 2, 1997: 133\u2013157</ref>\n\nDuring the World War II, Jehovah's Witnesses experienced mob attacks in America and were temporarily banned in Canada and Australia because of their lack of support for the war effort. They won significant Supreme Court victories involving the rights of [[Freedom of speech|free speech]] and [[Freedom of religion|religion]] that have had a great impact on legal interpretation of these rights for others.<ref>Patrick J.

Accounts of miraculous healing are common within the church, and adherents often refuse traditional medical treatments.  Legal troubles sometimes result when they forbid medical treatment of their children.<ref>Stephen Gottschalk, ''The Emergence of Christian Science in American Religious Life'' 1973)</ref>\n\nThe Church is unique among American denominations in several ways.  It is highly centralized, with all the local churches merely branches of the mother church in Boston. There are no ministers, but there are practitioners who are integral to the movement. The practitioners operate local businesses that help members heal their illnesses by the power of the mind. They depend for their clientele on the approval of the Church. Starting in the late 19th century the Church has rapidly lost membership, although it does not publish statistics. Its flagship newspaper ''Christian Science Monitor'' lost most of its subscribers and dropped its paper version to become an online source.<ref>Stephen Gottschalk, \"Christian Science Polity in Crisis,\" ''The Christian Century'' Volume: 110.

Stone]] and [[Alexander Campbell (clergyman)|Alexander Campbell]] merged (referred to as the \"[[Stone-Campbell Movement]]\").\n* [[Episcopal Church (United States)|Episcopal Church]] - founded as an offshoot of the [[Church of England]]; now the United States branch of the Anglican Communion.\n* [[National Baptist Convention, USA, Inc.|National Baptist Convention]] - the largest African American religious organization in the United States and the second largest Baptist denomination in the world.\n* [[Pentecostalism]] - movement that emphasizes the role of the [[Holy Spirit]], finds its historic roots in the [[Azusa Street Revival]] in Los Angeles, California, from 1904 to 1906, sparked by Charles Parham\n* [[Reconstructionist Judaism]]\n* [[Southern Baptist Convention]], the largest Baptist group in the world and the largest Protestant denomination in the United States. In 1995, it renounced its 1845 origins in the defense of slavery and racial superiority.\n* [[Unitarian Universalism]] - a theologically liberal religious movement founded in 1961 from the union of the well established [[Unitarianism|Unitarian]] and [[Universalist]] churches.\n* [[United Church of Christ]] - formed in 1957 as a [[united and uniting churches|united and uniting]] church from a merger of the [[Congregational Christian Church]] and [[Evangelical and Reformed Church]]. Congregations participating in the merger descended from Congregationalist churches of New England, German Lutheran and Reformed Churches largely from the Midwest, and various of [[Campbellite]], [[Christian Connection|Christian Connexion]] and [[Christians (Stone Movement)|\"Christian\"]] churches. \n* [[Cumberland Presbyterian Church]] - founded in 1810 in [[Dickson County, Tennessee]] by [[Samuel McAdow]], [[Finis Ewing]], and [[Samuel King (minister)|Samuel King]].\n\n==Benevolent and missionary societies==\n[[Benevolent society|Benevolent societies]] were an extremely new and conspicuous feature of the American landscape during the first half of the 19th century. Originally devoted to the salvation of souls, they eventually focused on the eradication of every kind of social ill. Benevolent societies were the direct result of the extraordinary energies generated by the evangelical movement\u2014specifically, by the \"activism\" resulting from conversion. \"The evidence of God's grace,\" Presbyterian evangelist [[Charles Grandison Finney]] insisted, \"was a person's benevolence toward others.\"<ref>Dwight Burlingame, ed. ''Philanthropy in America: a comprehensive historical encyclopedia'' (2004)</ref>\n\nThe evangelical establishment used this powerful network of voluntary, ecumenical benevolent societies to Christianize the nation. The earliest and most important of these organizations focused their efforts on the conversion of sinners to the new birth or to the creation of conditions (such as sobriety sought by [[Temperance movement|temperance societies]]) in which conversions could occur. The six largest societies in 1826\u201327 were: the American Education Society, the [[American Board of Commissioners for Foreign Missions]], the [[American Bible Society]], the [[American Sunday School Union]], the [[American Tract Society]], and the [[American Home Missionary Society]].\n\nMost denominations operated missions abroad (and some to Indians and Asians in the US).

Grant was determined to divide Native American post appointments \"up among the religious churches\"; by 1872, 73 Indian agencies were divided among religious denominations.<ref> Francis Paul Prucha, ''The Great Father: The United States Government and the American Indians'' (1984), pp. 501\u2013503.</ref> A core policy was to put the western reservations under the control of religious denominations.  In 1872, of the 73 agencies assigned, the Methodists received 14 reservations; the Orthodox Quakers ten; the Presbyterians nine; the Episcopalians eight; the Catholics seven; the Hicksite Quakers  six; the Baptists five; the Dutch Reformed five; the Congregationalists three; the Disciples two; Unitarians two; [[American Board of Commissioners for Foreign Missions]] one; and Lutherans one. The selection criteria were vague and some critics saw the Peace Policy as violating Native American freedom of religion. Catholics wanted a bigger role and set up the [[Bureau of Catholic Indian Missions]] in 1874. The Peace Policy remained in force until 1881.<ref>Francis Paul Prucha, ''American Indian Policy in Crisis, Christian Reformers and the Indian, 1865\u20131900'' (2014) pp. 30\u201371.</ref>  Historian Cary Collins says Grant's Peace Policy, failed in the Pacific Northwest chiefly because of sectarian competition and the priority placed on proselytizing by the religious denominations.<ref>Cary C.

From 1886 to 1926 the most active recruiting agency was the Student Volunteer Movement for Foreign Missions (SVM), which used its base on campus YMCAs to appeal to enlist over 8,000 young Protestants. The idea quickly was copied by the new World's Student Christian Federation (WSCF), with strength in  Great Britain, and Europe, and even as far as Australia, India, China and Japan.

If the Church can give it to them, plus Christianity, they will take it; otherwise they will get it elsewhere, without Christianity\u2014and that speedily.

The Commission's report, ''Re-Thinking Missions: A Laymen's Inquiry After One Hundred Years'' (1932) and known as the \"Hocking report,\" reflected changing ideas about the wisdom of a reduced role for western missionaries. It generated fierce debate. Commission members traveled to Asian cities to meet missionaries and local people. While in China, Hocking consulted with the famous writer [[Pearl S.

In the Thirteen colonies, Catholicism was introduced with the settling of [[Maryland]] in 1634; this colony offered a rare example of [[religious toleration]] in a fairly intolerant age. Maryland law remained a major center, as exemplified by the pre-eminence of the Archdiocese of Baltimore in Catholic circles. However, at the time of the [[American Revolution]], Catholics formed less than one percent of the white population of the thirteen states.<ref>In his report on the state of Catholicism, [[John Carroll (bishop)|John Carroll]] in 1785 estimated the Catholic population in the 13 states was 25,000; the 1790 Census counted four million Americans.

''The religious history of America'' (2002) p. 100</ref>  Religiously, the Catholics were characterized by personalism, discipline, and a prayer life that was essentially personal, demanding only a small role for priests and none for bishops.  Ritualism was important, and focused on daily prayers, Sunday Mass, and observance of two dozen holy days.<ref>Jay P. Dolan, ''The American Catholic Experience: A History from Colonial Times to the Present'' (1985) p. 94</ref>\n\nThe main source of Catholics in the United States was the huge numbers of European immigrants of the 19th and 20th centuries, especially from Germany, Ireland, Italy, and Poland. Recently, most Catholic immigrants come from [[Latin America]], especially from Mexico.<ref>James Terence Fisher, ''Communion of Immigrants: A History of Catholics in America'' (2002)</ref>\n\nThe [[Irish Americans|Irish]] came to dominate the church, providing most of the bishops, college presidents and lay leaders. They strongly supported the \"[[ultramontane]]\" position favoring the authority of the pope.<ref>James J. Hennesey, ''American Catholics: A History of the Roman Catholic Community in the United States'' (1983)</ref>\n\nIn the latter half of the 19th century, the first attempt at standardizing discipline in the church occurred with the convocation of the [[Plenary Councils of Baltimore]]. These councils resulted in the [[Baltimore Catechism]] and the establishment of [[The Catholic University of America]].<ref>James M. O'Toole, et al. ''The Faithful: A History of Catholics in America'' (2009)</ref>\n\nIn the 1960s the church went through dramatic changes, especially in the liturgy and the use of the language of the people instead of Latin.  The number of priests and nuns declined sharply as few entered and many left their vocations. Since 1990 scandals involving the coverup by bishops of priests who sexually abused young men has led to massive financial payments across the country\u2014and indeed in Europe as well.\n\n==Eastern Orthodoxy==\n{{Main article|History of the Eastern Orthodox Church in North America|Timeline of Eastern Orthodoxy in America}}\n\nEastern Orthodoxy spread to the North American continent with the founding of [[Russian America]], in what is today the [[U.S. state|State]] of [[Alaska]].  The spreading of the Orthodox faith went along with the [[Russian colonization of the Americas]] during the 18th and 19th centuries.

In social terms the [[American Jews|Jewish]] ethnic community began with small groups of merchants in colonial ports such as [[New York City]] and [[Charleston, South Carolina|Charleston]]. In the mid- and late-19th century well-educated German Jews arrived and settled in towns and cities across the United States, especially as dry goods merchants. From 1880 to 1924 large numbers of Yiddish-speaking Jews arrived from [[Eastern Europe]], settling in New York City and other large cities. After 1926 numbers came as refugees from Europe; after 1980 many came from the [[Soviet Union]], and there has been a flow from [[Israel]]. [[Historical Jewish population comparisons|By the year 1900]] the 1.5 million Jews residing in the United States were the third most of any nation, behind Russia and [[Austria-Hungary]]. The proportion of the population has been about 2% to 3% since 1900, and in the 21st century Jews were widely diffused in major metropolitan areas around New York or the [[Northeastern United States]], and especially in [[South Florida]] and [[California]].<ref>Hasia Diner, ''The Jews of the United States, 1654\u20132000'' (2006)</ref><ref>Jonathan D.

Despite a common background, the groups' views on broader [[religious toleration]] were mixed. While some notable examples such as [[Roger Williams (theologian)|Roger Williams]] of [[Rhode Island]] and [[William Penn]] ensured the protection of religious minorities within their colonies, others such as the [[Plymouth Colony]] and [[Massachusetts Bay Colony]] had established churches. The Dutch colony of the [[New Netherlands]] had also established the [[Dutch Reformed Church]] and outlawed all other worship, although enforcement by the [[Dutch West India Company]] in the last years of the colony was sparse.  Part of the reason for establishment was financial: the established Church was responsible for [[poor relief]], and dissenting churches would therefore have a significant advantage.\n\nThere were also opponents to the support of any established church even at the state level.  In 1773, [[Isaac Backus]], a prominent Baptist minister in [[New England]], observed that when \"church and state are separate, the effects are happy, and they do not at all interfere with each other: but where they have been confounded together, no tongue nor pen can fully describe the mischiefs that have ensued.\"  Thomas Jefferson's influential [[Virginia Statute for Religious Freedom]] was enacted in 1786, five years before the [[United States Bill of Rights|Bill of Rights]].\n\nMost Anglican ministers, and many Anglicans outside the South, were [[Loyalist (American Revolution)|Loyalists]]. The Anglican Church was disestablished during the Revolution, and following the separation from Britain was reorganized as the independent [[Episcopal Church (United States)|Episcopal Church]].\n\n===Establishment Clause===\nThe [[Establishment Clause of the First Amendment|Establishment Clause]] of the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution]] reads, \"Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof . . .\" In a letter written in 1802, [[Thomas Jefferson]] used the phrase \"[[separation of church and state]]\" to describe the combined effect of the Establishment Clause and the [[Free Exercise Clause of the First Amendment]]. Though \"separation of church and state\" does not appear in the Constitution, it has since been quoted in several opinions handed down by the [[United States Supreme Court]].<ref>Jefferson's Danbury letter has been cited favorably by the Supreme Court many times. In its 1879 [[Reynolds v. United States]] decision the high court said Jefferson's observations 'may be accepted almost as an authoritative declaration of the scope and effect of the [First] Amendment.' In the court's 1947 [[Everson v. Board of Education]] decision, Justice [[Hugo Black]] wrote, 'In the words of Thomas Jefferson, the clause against establishment of religion by law was intended to erect a wall of separation between church and state.'</ref>\n\n[[Robert N. Bellah]] has argued in his writings that although the separation of church and state is grounded firmly in the constitution of the United States, this does not mean that there is no religious dimension in the political society of the United States. He used the term [[Civil Religion]] to describe the specific relation between politics and religion in the United States. His 1967 article analyzes the inaugural speech of [[John F. Kennedy]]: ''\"Considering the separation of church and state, how is a president justified in using the word 'God' at all? The answer is that the separation of church and state has not denied the political realm a religious dimension.\"<ref>{{Cite journal\n| first =Robert Neelly\n| last =Bellah\n| authorlink =Robert N.

''Divided by God''. p. 24 (\"Williams's metaphor was rediscovered by [[Isaac Backus]], a New England Baptist of Jefferson's generation, who believed, like Williams, that an established church\u2014which he considered to exist in the Massachusetts of his day\u2014would never protect religious dissenters like himself and must be opposed in order to keep religion pure.\")</ref>  It was later used by Jefferson as a commentary on the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]] and its restriction on the legislative branch of the federal government, in an 1802 letter.\n\nJefferson's and Madison's conceptions of ''separation'' have long been debated.  Jefferson refused to issue Proclamations of Thanksgiving sent to him by Congress during his presidency, though he did issue a Thanksgiving and Prayer proclamation as Governor of Virginia and vetoed two bills on the grounds they violated the first amendment.\n\nAfter retiring from the presidency, Madison argued in his detached memoranda<ref>[http://press-pubs.uchicago.edu/founders/documents/amendI_religions64.html James Madison's Detached Memoranda]</ref> for a stronger separation of church and state, opposing the very presidential issuing of religious proclamations he himself had done, and also opposing the appointment of chaplains to Congress.\n\nJefferson's opponents said his position meant the rejection of Christianity, but this was a caricature. In setting up the University of Virginia, Jefferson encouraged all the separate sects to have preachers of their own, though there was a constitutional ban on the State supporting a Professorship of Divinity, arising from his own [[Virginia Statute for Religious Freedom]].<ref>Dumas Malone, ''Jefferson and his Times'' 6:393</ref>\n\n====Test acts====\n{{main article|No religious test clause}}\nThe absence of an establishment of religion did not necessarily imply that all men were free to hold office. Most colonies had a [[Test Act]], and several states retained them for a short time.  This stood in contrast to the Federal Constitution, which explicitly prohibits the employment of any religious test for Federal office, and which through the Fourteenth Amendment later extended this prohibition to the States.<ref>Bradley, Gerard V. \"No Religious Test Clause and the Constitution of Religious Liberty: A Machine That Has Gone of Itself, The.\" ''Case Western Reserve Law Review'' 37 (1986): 674. [http://scholarship.law.nd.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1066&context=law_faculty_scholarship online]</ref>\n\n[[Article Six of the United States Constitution]] provides that  \"no [[religious test|religious Test]] shall ever be required as a Qualification to any Office or public Trust under the United States\".  Prior to the inclusion of the Bill of Rights, this was the only mention of religious freedom in the Constitution.\n\n===First Amendment===\nThe first amendment to the US Constitution states \"Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof\" The two parts, known as the \"establishment clause\" and the \"free exercise clause\" respectively, form the textual basis for the Supreme Court's interpretations of the \"separation of church and state\" doctrine.\n\nOn August 15, 1789 Madison said, \"he apprehended the meaning of the words to be, that Congress should not establish a religion, and enforce the legal observation of it by law, nor compel men to worship God in any manner contrary to their conscience....\u201d<ref>[http://press-pubs.uchicago.edu/founders/documents/amendI_religions53.html The Founders' Constitution]\nVolume 5, Amendment I (Religion), Document 53.  The University of Chicago Press, retrieved 8/9/07.</ref>\n\nAll states disestablished religion by 1833; Massachusetts was the last state. This ended the practice of allocating taxes to churches.\n\n===Supreme Court since 1947===\n{{Main|School prayer#United States}}\nThe phrase ''\"separation of church and state\"'' became a definitive part of Establishment Clause [[jurisprudence]] in ''[[Everson v. Board of Education]]'', 330 U.S. 1 (1947), a case that dealt with a state law that allowed government funds for transportation to religious schools.  While the ruling upheld the state law allowing taxpayer funding of transportation to religious schools as constitutional, ''Everson'' was also the first case to hold the Establishment Clause applicable to the state legislatures as well as Congress, based upon the [[due process]] clause of the [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourteenth Amendment]].<ref name=\"Jonathan A. Wright 2010\">Jonathan A. Wright, ''Separation of Church and State'' (2010)</ref>\n\nIn 1949 Bible reading was a part of routine in the public schools of at least thirty-seven states. In twelve of these states, Bible reading was legally required by state laws; 11 states passed these laws after 1913. In 1960, 42 per cent of school districts nationwide tolerated or required Bible reading, and 50 per cent reported some form of homeroom daily devotional exercise. <ref>Adam Laats, \"Our schools, our country: American evangelicals, public schools, and the Supreme Court decisions of 1962 and 1963.\" ''Journal of religious history'' 36.3 (2012): 319-334 at p 321-22.</ref>\n\nSince 1962, the Supreme Court has repeatedly ruled that prayers organized by public school officials schools are unconstitutional. Students are allowed to pray privately, and to join religious clubs after school hours. Colleges, universities, and private schools are not affected by the Supreme Court rulings.  Reactions to ''Engel'' and ''Abington'' were widely negative, with over 150 constitutional amendments submitted to reverse the policy. None passed Congress.<ref>Geoffrey R. Stone, \"In Opposition to the School Prayer Amendment.\" ''University of Chicago Law Review'' 50 (1983): 823-848.  [http://chicagounbound.uchicago.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=4338&context=uclrev online].</ref>  It is a matter of the government promoting an establishment of religion. The Supreme Court has also ruled that so-called \"voluntary\" school prayers are also unconstitutional, because they force some students to be outsiders to the main group, and because they subject dissenters to intense peer group pressure. In [[Lee v. Weisman]] The Supreme Court held in 1992:\n:the State may not place the student dissenter in the dilemma of participating or protesting. Since adolescents are often susceptible to peer pressure, especially in matters of social convention, the State may no more use social pressure to enforce orthodoxy than it may use direct means. The embarrassment and intrusion of the religious exercise cannot be refuted by arguing that the prayers are of a de minimis character, since that is an affront to ...those for whom the prayers have meaning, and since any intrusion was both real and a violation of the objectors' rights.<ref>{{cite book|author1=Robert Palestini |author2=Karen Palestini Falk|title=Law and American Education: An Instructor's Guide|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RhP3CT4P2-AC&pg=PA33|year=2002|publisher=R&L Education|page=33|isbn=9781461731634}}</ref><ref>505 U.S. 577, Syllabus.</ref>\n\nIn 1962, the Supreme Court extended this analysis to the issue of prayer in public schools.  In [[Engel v. Vitale]] 370 U.S. 421 (1962), the Court determined it unconstitutional for state officials to compose an official school prayer and require its recitation in public schools, even when it is non-denominational and students may excuse themselves from participation.  As such, any teacher, faculty, or student can pray in school, in accordance with their own religion.  However, they may not lead such prayers in class, or in other \"official\" school settings such as assemblies or programs.\n\nCurrently, the Supreme Court applies a three-pronged test to determine whether legislation comports with the Establishment Clause, known as the \"[[Lemon Test]]\". First, the legislature must have adopted the law with a neutral or non-religious purpose. Second, the statute's principal or primary effect must be one that neither advances nor inhibits religion. Third, the statute must not result in an excessive entanglement of government with religion.<ref name=\"Jonathan A.

In the late 19th and early 20th century most major denominations started overseas missionary activity.  The \"[[Mainline Protestant]]\" denominations promoted the \"[[Social Gospel]]\" in the early 20th century, calling on Americans to reform their society; the demand for [[Prohibition in the United States|prohibition of liquor]] was especially strong. After 1970, the mainline denominations (such as Methodists, Presbyterians and Episcopalians) lost membership and influence. The more conservative [[Evangelicalism|evangelical]], [[Christian fundamentalism|fundamentalist]], and [[Charismatic Christianity|charismatic]] denominations (such as the Southern Baptists) grew rapidly until the 1990s and helped form the [[Christian right|Religious Right]] in politics. The nation had a Catholic population from its founding, and as it expanded into areas that had been part of the Spanish and French empires, that population increased substantially.  Immigration from Catholic countries increased Catholic diversity in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. The Catholic Church has been the largest religious organization in the United States since at least the turn of the twentieth century.\n\nAs Western Europe secularized in the late 20th century, the Americans largely resisted the trend, so that by the 21st century the US was one of the most strongly Christian of all major nations. Religiously based moral positions on issues such as abortion and homosexuality played a hotly debated [[religion and politics in the United States|role in American politics]].\n\n==Demographics==\nThe [[U.S. census]] has never asked Americans directly about their religion  or religious beliefs, but it did compile statistics from each denomination starting in 1945.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/prod/www/religion.htm |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/19990508145129/http://www.census.gov/prod/www/religion.htm |url-status=dead |archive-date=1999-05-08 |title=Religion - Publications - US Census Bureau |publisher=Census.gov |accessdate=2012-09-17 }}</ref>\n\nFinke and Stark conducted a statistical analysis of the official census data  after 1850, and Atlas for 1776, to estimate the number of Americans who were adherents to a specific denomination.

Traditional Native American ceremonial ways can vary widely, and are based on the differing histories and beliefs of individual tribes, clans and bands. Early European explorers describe individual [[tribe (Native American)|Native American tribes]] and even small bands as each having their own religious practices. Theology may be [[Monotheism|monotheistic]], [[Polytheism|polytheistic]], [[Henotheism|henotheistic]], [[Animism|animistic]], or some combination thereof. Traditional beliefs are usually passed down in the forms of oral histories, stories, allegories and principles, and rely on face to face teaching in one's family and community.<ref>{{cite book|author=\u00c5ke Hultkrantz|title=The Religions of the American Indians|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Zo9nzMQLBEIC|year=1981|publisher=University of California Press|pages=1\u2013156|isbn=9780520042391}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Ten-sq\u00faat-a-way.jpg|thumb|right|175px|Tenskwatawa, by [[George Catlin]].]]\n\nFrom time to time important religious leaders organized revivals. In Indiana in 1805, [[Tenskwatawa]]  (called the Shanee Prophet by Americans) led a religious revival following a smallpox epidemic and a series of witch-hunts. His beliefs were based on the earlier teachings of the [[Lenape]] prophets, [[Scattamek]] and [[Neolin]], who predicted a coming apocalypse that would destroy the European-American settlers.<ref>Adam Jortner, ''The Gods of Prophetstown: The Battle of Tippecanoe and the Holy War for the American Frontier'' (2011)</ref>  Tenskwatawa urged the tribes to reject the ways of the Americans: to give up firearms, liquor, American style clothing, to pay traders only half the value of their debts, and to refrain from ceding any more lands to the United States. The revival led to warfare led by his brother [[Tecumseh]] against the white settlers.<ref>Rachel Buff, \"Tecumseh and Tenskwatawa: Myth, Historiography and Popular Memory.\" ''Historical Reflections/R\u00e9flexions Historiques'' (1995): 277\u2013299.</ref>\n\nNative Americans were the target of extensive Christian missionary activity. Catholics launched [[Jesuit Missions amongst the Huron]] and the [[Spanish missions in California]]) and various Protestant denominations.  Numerous Protestant denominations were active.  By the late-19th century, most Native Americans integrated into American society generally have become Christians, along with a large portion of those living on reservations.<ref>Robert F.

Their position was opposed by the ruling class by the 1620s, which insisted that the Puritans conform to Anglican religious practices. Puritans in England were threatened as England verged on civil war.\n\nBeginning in 1630 and for the decade as many as 20,000 Puritans emigrated to America from England. Most settled in New England, but some went as far as the West Indies. Some went back to England during the English Civil War 1642-1646 and the Commonwealth.  Theologically, the Puritans were \"non-separating [[Congregational church|Congregationalists]].\" Unlike the Pilgrims, who came to Massachusetts in 1620, the Puritans believed that the Church of England was a true church, though in need of major reforms. Every New England Congregational church was considered an independent entity, beholden to no hierarchy. There were no bishops. The membership was composed, at least initially, of men and women who had undergone a conversion experience and could prove it to other members.\n\n===Persecution in America===\n[[Image:Roger Williams statue by Franklin Simmons.jpg|thumb|right|150px|[[Roger Williams (theologian)|Roger Williams]] was expelled from the [[Massachusetts Bay Colony]] in 1636 for advocating [[religious liberty]].]]\nAlthough they were victims of religious persecution in Europe, the Puritans supported the theory that sanctioned it: the need for uniformity of religion in the state.\n\nOnce in control in New England, they sought to break \"the very neck of Schism and vile opinions.\" The \"business\" of the first settlers, a Puritan minister recalled in 1681, \"was not Toleration, but [they] were professed enemies of it.\"<ref>{{cite book |title=The Puritans: A Sourcebook of Their Writings|page=185|author=Thomas Herbert Johnson}}</ref> Puritans expelled dissenters from their colonies, a fate that in 1636 befell Roger Williams and in 1638 [[Anne Hutchinson]], America's first major female religious leader.\n\nThose who defied the Puritans by persistently returning to their jurisdictions risked [[capital punishment]], a penalty imposed on the [[Boston martyrs]], four [[Quaker]]s, between 1659 and 1661. Reflecting on the 17th century's intolerance, Thomas Jefferson was unwilling to concede to Virginians any moral superiority to the Puritans. Beginning in 1659, Virginia enacted anti-Quaker laws, including the death penalty for refractory Quakers. Jefferson surmised that \"if no capital execution took place here, as did in New England, it was not owing to the moderation of the church, or the spirit of the legislature.\"<ref>{{cite book |url=https://archive.org/details/unset0000unse_s5t3 |url-access=registration |page=[https://archive.org/details/unset0000unse_s5t3/page/365 365] |title=A brief guide to beliefs: ideas, theologies, mysteries, and movements |last=Edwards |first=Linda |location=Westminster|publisher= John Knox Press |year=2001 |isbn=978-0-664-22259-8}}</ref>\n\n====Founding of Rhode Island====\nExpelled from Massachusetts in the winter in 1636, former Puritan leader Roger Williams issued an impassioned plea for freedom of conscience.

Small numbers of Jews continued to come to the British North American colonies, settling mainly in the seaport towns.

Jones formulated the first theory of the origins and essence of Quakerism as fundamentally \"mystical\" in his introduction to William Braithwaite's history of Quakerism [Jones based his introduction on an earlier exploration of the history of Christian mysticism, Studies in Mystical Religion, one of a handful of pioneering works in that  field in The early Twentieth century (1909). A few years later he expanded his study with Spiritual Reformers of the Sixteenth and Seventeenth Centuries (1914)] (Braithwaite, 1912). ln 1921, he emphatically reaffirmed his thesis: \"No other large, organized, historically continuous body of Christians has yet existed which has been so fundamentally mystical, both in theory and practice, as the Society of Friends ... \" (Jones, 190 I, xiii). For over 25 years, Jones' claim seemed too accurate to question. But in 1955 a major shift in Quaker studies occurred when Hugh L. Doncaster claimed that new scholarship viewed Quakerism in another light. [See L. Hugh Doncaster, \"Forward to the Second Edition,\" in Wm. C. Braithwaite's The Beginnings of Quakerism, ed. Henry J. Cadbury (1955).] The paradigm shift had been set in motion with the publication of Geoffrey F. Nuttall's work, The Holy Spirit in Puritan Faith and Experience, in 1946 (revised 1992). Nuttall, a non-Quaker historian, supplanted .Jones' mystical theory with a new theory of Quakers as radical Puritans. According to NuttalI, George Fox and the Quakers, \"... who in the exclusive sense are not puritans but the puritans' fiercest foes, ... repeat, extend, and fuse so much of what is held by the radical, Separatist party within Puritanism, that they cannot be denied the name or excluded from consideration.\"}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/holyspiritinpuri0000nutt|url-access=registration|title=The Holy Spirit in Puritan Faith and Experience|last=Nuttall|first=Geoffrey F.|date=1992-07-15|publisher=University of Chicago Press|isbn=9780226609416|location=|pages=[https://archive.org/details/holyspiritinpuri0000nutt/page/13 13]|language=en}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|last=Durnbaugh|first=Donald F.|date=2012-04-04|title=Baptists and Quakers\u2014Left Wing Puritans?|journal=Quaker History|volume=62|issue=2|pages=67\u201382|doi=10.1353/qkh.1973.0005|issn=1934-1504}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|last=Horle|first=Craig W.|date=1976-01-01|title=Quakers and Baptists 1647\u20131660|journal=Baptist Quarterly|volume=26|issue=8|pages=344\u2013362|doi=10.1080/0005576X.1976.11751464|issn=0005-576X}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|last=Maclear|first=James F.|date=1950-12-01|title=Quakerism and the end of the Interregnum: a Chapter in the Domestication of Radical Puritanism|journal=Church History|volume=19|issue=4|pages=240\u2013270|doi=10.2307/3161160|issn=1755-2613|jstor=3161160}}</ref> Historians in support of the Puritan classification of Quakers notice that Quakers stretch the sober deportment of the Puritans into a glorification of \"plainness.\"<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=p0jndZXU-34C&pg=PA14&lpg=PA14&dq=sober+deportment+of+the+Puritans+into+a+glorification+of+%22plainness.%22#v=onepage&q=sober%20deportment%20of%20the%20Puritans%20into%20a%20glorification%20of%20%22plainness.%22&f=false|title=America on the Cusp of God's Grace: The Biblical Connection to the Stars and Stripes|last=Hurst|first=Dennis G.|date=2010-11-12|publisher=iUniverse|isbn=9781450269551|location=|pages=14|language=en|quote=They stretched the sober deportment of the Puritans into a glorification of \"plainness.\" Theologically, they expanded the Puritan concept of a church of individuals ...}}</ref> Theologically, they expanded the Puritan concept of a church of individuals regenerated by the [[Holy Spirit]] to the idea of the indwelling of the Spirit or the \"Light of Christ\" in every person.\n\nSuch teaching struck many of the Quakers' contemporaries as dangerous [[heresy]]. Quakers were severely persecuted in England for daring to deviate so far from orthodox Christianity. By 1680, 10,000 Quakers had been imprisoned in England and 243 had died of torture and mistreatment in jail.\n\nThis reign of terror impelled Friends to seek refuge in Rhode Island in the 1670s, where they soon became well entrenched. In 1681, when Quaker leader [[William Penn]] parlayed a debt owed by [[Charles II of England|Charles II]] to his father into a charter for the province of [[Pennsylvania]], many more Quakers were prepared to grasp the opportunity to live in a land where they might worship freely.

In 1634, Lord Baltimore's two ships, the ''Ark'' and the ''Dove'', sailed with the first 200 settlers to Maryland. They included two Catholic priests. Lord Baltimore assumed that religion was a private matter. He rejected the need for an established church, guaranteed liberty of conscience to all Christians, and embraced pluralism.<ref>John D.

In practice, establishment meant that local taxes were funneled through the local parish to handle the needs of local government, such as roads and poor relief, in addition to the salary of the minister.  There was never a bishop in colonial Virginia, and in practice the local vestry consisted of laymen who controlled the parish and handled local taxes, roads and poor relief.<ref>Edward L.

This allowed devout Anglicans to lead an active and sincere religious life apart from the unsatisfactory formal church services. However, the stress on private devotion weakened the need for a bishop or a large institutional church of the sort Blair wanted.

It resulted from powerful preaching that deeply affected listeners (already church members) with a deep sense of personal guilt and salvation by Christ.  Pulling away from ritual and ceremony, the Great Awakening made relationship with God intensely personal to the average person by creating a deep sense of spiritual guilt, forgiveness, redemption and peace. Historian Sydney E. Ahlstrom sees it as part of a \"great international Protestant upheaval\" that also created [[Pietism]] in Germany, the [[Evangelicalism|Evangelical Revival]] and [[Methodism]] in England.<ref>Sydney E. Armstrong, ''A Religious History of the American People''. (1972) p. 263</ref> It brought Christianity to the slaves and was an apocalyptic event in [[New England]] that challenged established church authority. It resulted in division between the new revivalists and the old traditionalists who insisted on ritual and doctrine.\nThe new style of sermons and the way people practiced their faith breathed new life into Christian faith in America. People became passionately and emotionally involved in their relationship with God, rather than passively listening to intellectual discourse in a detached manner. Ministers who used this new style of preaching were generally called \"new lights\", while the preachers of old were called \"old lights\". People began to study the [[Bible]] at home, which effectively decentralized the means of informing the public on religious manners and was akin to the individualistic trends present in Europe during the [[Protestant Reformation]].<ref name=\"Thomas S. Kidd 2007\"/>\n\nThe fundamental premise of evangelicalism is the conversion of individuals from a state of sin to a \"[[Born again Christianity|new birth]]\" through preaching of the Bible leading to [[Salvation by faith|faith]]. The First Great Awakening led to changes in American colonial society. In New England, the Great Awakening was influential among many [[Congregational church|Congregationalists]].  In the Middle and Southern colonies, especially in the \"Backcountry\" regions, the Awakening was influential among [[Presbyterianism|Presbyterians]]. In the South [[Baptist]] and [[Methodist]] preachers converted both whites and enslaved blacks.<ref>Thomas S. Kidd, ''The Great Awakening: The Roots of Evangelical Christianity in Colonial America'' (2009)</ref>\n\nDuring the first decades of the 18th century, in the [[Connecticut River Valley]], a series of local \"awakenings\" began in the Congregational church with ministers including [[Jonathan Edwards (theologian)|Jonathan Edwards]]. The first new Congregational Church in the Massachusetts Colony during the great awakening period, was in 1731 at [[Uxbridge, MA|Uxbridge]] and called the Rev. [[Nathan Webb]] as its Pastor. By the 1730s, they had spread into what was interpreted as a general outpouring of the [[Holy Spirit (Christianity)|Spirit]] that bathed the American colonies, England, Wales, and Scotland.\n\nIn mass open-air revivals powerful preachers like [[George Whitefield]] brought thousands of souls to the [[Born again (Christianity)|new birth]]. The Great Awakening, which had spent its force in New England by the mid-1740s, split the Congregational and Presbyterian churches into supporters\u2014called \"[[New Lights]]\" and \"[[The Old Side-New Side Controversy|New Side]]\"\u2014and opponents\u2014the \"Old Lights\" and \"Old Side.\" Many New England New Lights became [[Separate Baptists]]. Largely through the efforts of a charismatic preacher from New England named [[Shubal Stearns]] and paralleled by the New Side Presbyterians (who were eventually reunited on their own terms with the Old Side), they carried the Great Awakening into the southern colonies, igniting a series of the revivals that lasted well into the 19th century.<ref name=\"LOC Religion 18th century\"/>\n\nThe supporters of the Awakening and its evangelical thrust\u2014[[Presbyterian]]s, Baptists and [[Methodist]]s\u2014became the largest American Protestant denominations by the first decades of the 19th century. Opponents of the Awakening or those split by it\u2014Anglicans, Quakers, and Congregationalists\u2014were left behind.\n\nUnlike the [[Second Great Awakening]] that began about 1800 and which reached out to the unchurched, the First Great Awakening focused on people who were already church members.

Baptist services emphasized emotion; the only ritual,  baptism, involved immersion (not sprinkling as in the Anglican tradition) of adults only. Opposed to the low moral standards prevalent around them, the Baptists strictly enforced their own high standards of personal morality, and especially opposed sexual misconduct, heavy drinking, frivolous spending, missing services, cursing, and revelry.  Church trials took place frequently, and Baptist churches expelled members who did not submit to discipline.<ref>\n{{cite book\n| last1                 = Spangler\n| first1                = Jewel L.\n| title                 = Virginians Reborn: Anglican Monopoly, Evangelical Dissent, and the Rise of the Baptists in the Late Eighteenth Century\n| url                   = https://books.google.com/books?id=R0RVN0vx50gC\n| location              = Charlottesville\n| publisher             = University of Virginia Press\n| date      = 2008\n| page                  = \n| isbn                  = 9780813926797\n}}\n</ref>\n\nMany historians have debated the implications of the religious rivalries for the coming of the [[American Revolution]] of 1765\u20131783.<ref>Bonomi, ''Under the Cope of Heaven: Religion, Society, and Politics in Colonial America'' (1988) pp. 187\u2013222 and 269\u201378, cites over forty scholars.</ref>  The Baptist farmers did introduce a new egalitarian ethic that largely displaced the semi-aristocratic ethic of the Anglican planters. However, both groups supported the Revolution.  There was a sharp contrast between the austerity of the plain-living Baptists and the opulence of the Anglican planters, who controlled local government. Baptist church discipline, mistaken by the gentry for radicalism, served to ameliorate disorder. The struggle for religious toleration erupted and played out during the [[American Revolution]], as the Baptists worked to disestablish the Anglican church.<ref>Rhys Isaac, \"Evangelical Revolt: The Nature of the Baptists' Challenge to the Traditional Order in Virginia, 1765 to 1775,\" ''William and Mary Quarterly'' 1974 31(3): 345\u2013368</ref>\n\nBaptists, [[German American|German Lutherans]] and Presbyterians funded their own ministers, and favored disestablishment of the Anglican church.\n\n====Methodists====\nMethodist missionaries were also active in the late colonial period. From 1776 to 1815 Methodist Bishop [[Francis Asbury]] made 42 trips into the western parts to visit Methodist congregations. In the 1780s itinerant Methodist preachers carried copies of an anti-slavery petition in their saddlebags throughout the state, calling for an end to slavery. At the same time, counter-petitions were circulated. The petitions were presented to the Assembly; they were debated, but no legislative action was taken, and after 1800 there was less and less religious opposition to slavery.<ref>Richard K.

Religious practice suffered in certain places because of the absence of ministers and the destruction of churches.\n\n===Church of England===\n{{main article|Episcopal Church (United States)}}\nThe American Revolution inflicted deeper wounds on the [[Church of England]] in America than on any other denomination because the [[English monarch]] was the head of the church. Church of England priests, at their ordination, swore allegiance to the [[British crown]].\n\nThe [[Book of Common Prayer]] offered prayers for the monarch, beseeching God \"to be his defender and keeper, giving him victory over all his enemies,\" who in 1776 were American soldiers as well as friends and neighbors of American parishioners of the Church of England. Loyalty to the church and to its head could be construed as treason to the American cause.\n\nPatriotic American members of the Church of England, loathing to discard so fundamental a component of their faith as The Book of Common Prayer, revised it to conform to the political realities.  After the [[Treaty of Paris (1783)]] in which Great Britain  formally recognized American independence, Anglicans were left without leadership or a formal institution. Samuel Seabury was consecrated bishop by the Scottish Episcopal Church in 1784. He resided in New York. After the requirement to take an Oath of Allegiance to the Crown two Americans were consecrated bishops in London in 1786 for Virginia and Pennsylvania. The Protestant [[Episcopal Church of the United States]] was created in 1787 as an autonomous in communion with the Church of England. It adopted a modified Book of Common Prayer which most notably used the Scottish Canon (Eucharistic Prayer). This consecration prayer moved the eucharistic doctrine of the American Church much closer to the Roman Catholic and Orthodox teachings and virtually undid Cranmer's rejection of the eucharist as a material sacrifice offered to God (which had been the accepted theology from the early 3rd century).\n\n==The new nation==\nHistorians in recent decades have debated the nature of American religiosity in the early 19th century, focusing on issues of secularism, deism, traditional religious practices, and newly emerging evangelical forms based on the [[Great Awakening]].<ref>Christopher Grasso, \"The Religious and the Secular in the Early American Republic,\" ''Journal of the Early Republic'' (Summer 2016) 36#2 pp. 359\u2013388.</ref><ref>Craig Calhoun, Mark Juergensmeyer, and Jonathan VanAntwerpen, eds.

However, the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution]], adopted in 1791, has played a central role in defining the relationship of the federal government to the free exercise of religion, and to the prohibition establishment of an official church. Its policies were extended to cover state governments in the 1940s.  The government is not allowed to hinder the free exercise of religion, and is not allowed to sponsor any particular religion through taxation of favors.<ref>James S.

The treaty was a routine diplomatic agreement but has attracted later attention because the English version included a clause about religion in the United States. \n<blockquote>As the Government of the United States of America is not, in any sense, founded on the Christian religion,\u2014as it has in itself no character of enmity against the laws, religion, or tranquility, of Mussulmen <nowiki>[</nowiki>[[Muslims]]<nowiki>]</nowiki>,\u2014and as the said States never entered into any war or act of hostility against any Mahometan <nowiki>[</nowiki>[[Mohammedan]]<nowiki>]</nowiki> nation, it is declared by the parties that no pretext arising from religious opinions shall ever produce an interruption of the harmony existing between the two countries.</blockquote>\n\nAccording to [[Franklin T. Lambert|Frank Lambert]], Professor of History at [[Purdue University]], the assurances in Article 11 were \"intended to allay the fears of the Muslim state by insisting that religion would not govern how the treaty was interpreted and enforced.  John Adams and the Senate made clear that the pact was between two sovereign states, not between two religious powers.\" Lambert writes, \n:\"By their actions, the Founding Fathers made clear that their primary concern was religious freedom, not the advancement of a state religion. Individuals, not the government, would define religious faith and practice in the United States. Thus the Founders ensured that in no official sense would America be a Christian Republic. Ten years after the Constitutional Convention ended its work, the country assured the world that the United States was a secular state, and that its negotiations would adhere to the rule of law, not the dictates of the Christian faith. The assurances were contained in the Treaty of Tripoli of 1797 and were intended to allay the fears of the Muslim state by insisting that religion would not govern how the treaty was interpreted and enforced.

The principal religious innovation produced by the Kentucky revivals was the [[camp meeting]].\n\nThe revivals at first were organized by Presbyterian ministers who modeled them after the extended outdoor [[communion seasons]], used by the Presbyterian Church in Scotland, which frequently produced emotional, demonstrative displays of religious conviction. In Kentucky, the pioneers loaded their families and provisions into their wagons and drove to the Presbyterian meetings, where they pitched tents and settled in for several days.\n\nWhen assembled in a field or at the edge of a forest for a prolonged religious meeting, the participants transformed the site into a camp meeting. The religious revivals that swept the Kentucky camp meetings were so intense and created such gusts of emotion that their original sponsors, the Presbyterians, as well the Baptists, soon repudiated them. The Methodists, however, adopted and eventually domesticated camp meetings and introduced them into the eastern states, where for decades they were one of the evangelical signatures of the denomination.\n\nThe Second Great Awakening (1800\u20131830s), unlike the first, focused on the unchurched and sought to instill in them a deep sense of personal salvation as experienced in revival meetings. The great revival quickly spread throughout Kentucky, Tennessee and southern Ohio. Each denomination had assets that allowed it to thrive on the frontier. The Methodists had an efficient organization that depended on ministers known as [[circuit rider (religious)|circuit rider]]s, who sought out people in remote frontier locations. The circuit riders came from among the common people, which helped them establish rapport with the frontier families they hoped to convert.\n\nThe Second Great Awakening exercised a profound impact on American religious history.  By 1859 evangelicalism emerged as a kind of national church or national religion and was the grand absorbing theme of American religious life.  The greatest gains were made by the very well organized Methodists. [[Francis Asbury]] (1745\u20131816) led the [[United Methodist Church|American Methodist movement]] as one of the most prominent religious leaders of the young republic.  Traveling throughout the eastern seaboard, [[Methodism]] grew quickly under Asbury's leadership into the nation's largest and most widespread denomination.  The numerical strength of the Baptists and Methodists rose relative to that of the denominations dominant in the colonial period\u2014the [[Anglicans]], Presbyterians, [[Congregational church|Congregationalists]], and [[Reformed churches|Reformed]]. Efforts to apply Christian teaching to the resolution of social problems presaged the [[Social Gospel]] of the late 19th century.  It also sparked the beginnings of groups such as the [[Mormons]], the [[Restoration Movement]] and the [[Holiness movement]].\n\n===Third Great Awakening===\n{{main article|Third Great Awakening}}\nThe Third Great Awakening was a period of religious activism in American history from the late 1850s to the 20th century. It affected pietistic Protestant denominations and had a strong sense of social activism.  It gathered strength from the [[postmillennial]] theology that the [[Second Coming]] of Christ would come after mankind had reformed the entire earth.  The [[Social Gospel]] Movement gained its force from the Awakening, as did the worldwide missionary movement.  New groupings emerged, such as the [[Holiness movement]] and [[Church of the Nazarene|Nazarene]] movements, and [[Christian Science]].<ref>Robert William Fogel, ''The Fourth Great Awakening & the Future of Egalitarianism'' (2000)</ref>\n\nThe Protestant mainline churches were growing rapidly in numbers, wealth and educational levels, throwing off their frontier beginnings and become centered in towns and cities. Intellectuals and writers such as [[Josiah Strong]] advocated a muscular Christianity with systematic outreach to the unchurched in America and around the globe.  Others built colleges and universities to train the next generation. Each denomination supported active missionary societies, and made the role of missionary one of high prestige.  The great majority of pietistic mainline Protestants (in the North) supported the [[History of the Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]], and urged it to endorse prohibition and social reforms.<ref>Paul Kleppner, ''The Third Electoral System, 1853\u20131892: Parties, Voters, and Political Cultures'' (2009)</ref><ref>Richard Jensen, ''The Winning of the Midwest'' (1971) p. 171</ref> See [[Third Party System]]\n\nThe awakening in numerous cities in 1858 was interrupted by the [[American Civil War]].

Changing social conditions forced a shift from the gospel of wealth to the Social Gospel. the \"[[Gospel of wealth]]\" was an appeal to rich Christians to share their wealth in philanthropy, while the Social Gospel called on ministers to take the lead themselves in eliminating social evils. The second challenge emerged from modern science, where evolutionary Darwinism generated quite different religious responses in terms of biblical authoritarianism, romantic liberalism and scientific modernism. Protestantism gradually abandoned its emphasis on individual salvation and laissez-faire individualism; although this tendency was resisted by fundamentalists who sought, often blindly, to cling to the theological foundations of Christianity to which the denominations have begun again to return.<ref>Sidney E.  Mead, \"American Protestantism since the Civil War. II. From Americanism to Christianity.\" ''Journal of Religion'' 36.2 (1956): 67-89. [https://www.jstor.org/stable/1199954 online]</ref>\n\nIncreasingly the nation encountered new minority religions which, unlike the Mormons, were not in a far off locale but right next door.  According to historian R. Laurence Moore, Christian Scientists, Pentecostals, Jehovah Witnesses and Catholics responded to hostile comments by sensing themselves as persecuted Americans on the margins of society, which made them cling tightly to their status as full citizens.. <ref>R. Laurence Moore, '' Religious Outsiders and the Making of Americans'' (1986)</ref>\n\n===The  South===\nHistorian [[Edward Ayers]] describes an impoverished South with a rich Spiritual life:\n: Religious faith and language appeared everywhere in the New South. It permeated public speech as well as private emotion. For many people, religion provided the measure of politics, the power behind law and reform, the reason to reach out to the poor and exploited, a pressure to cross racial boundaries. People viewed everything from courtship to child-rearing to their own deaths in religious terms. Even those filled with doubt or disdain could not escape the images, the assumptions, the power of faith.<ref> Edward Ayres, ''The Promise of the New South: Life After Reconstruction'' (1992), p 160. </ref>\nThe Baptists formed the largest grouping, for both Blacks and whites, with its loose networks of numerous small rural churches churches.  In second place for both races came the Methodists, with a hierarchical structure at the opposite end of the spectrum from the Baptists. Smaller fundamentalist groups that grew very large in the 20th century were starting to appear. Clusters of Roman Catholics appeared in the region's few cities, as well as southern Louisiana. Elite white Southerners, for the most part, were Episcopalians or Presbyterians. Across the region, ministers held high prestige positions, especially in the black community where they were typically political leaders as well. When the great majority Blacks were disenfranchised after 1890, the black preachers were still allowed to vote. Revivals were regular occurrences, attracting large crowds. It was usually the already converted who attended, so the number of new converts was relatively small but new or old, the all enjoyed the preaching and the socializing.<ref> Edward Ayres, ''The Promise of the New South'' (1992), pp  160. </ref><ref>Kenneth K.

The goal was to apply[[Christian ethics]] to [[social issue|social problem]]s, especially issues of [[social justice]] and  [[social evil]]s such as [[economic inequality]], [[poverty]], [[alcoholism]], [[crime]], [[Ethnic conflict|racial tensions]], [[slum]]s, unclean environment, [[child labor]], lack of [[labour unions|unionization]], poor schools, and the dangers of war.  Theologically, the Social Gospelers sought to put into practice the [[Lord's Prayer]]: \"Thy kingdom come, Thy will be done on earth as it is in heaven\".<ref>Cecelia Tichi, ''Civic Passions: Seven Who Launched Progressive America (and What They Teach Us). (2009) pp 205-239. [https://archive.org/details/civicpassionssev0000tich online]</ref> They typically were [[postmillennialism|postmillennialist]]; that is, they believed the [[Second Coming]] could not happen until humankind rid itself of [[social evil]]s by human effort. Social Gospel theologians rejected [[premillennialist]] theology, which held the [[Second Coming]] of Christ was imminent, and Christians should devote their energies to preparing for it rather than social issues. That perspective was strongest among fundamentalists and in the South. The Social Gospel was more popular among clergy than laity.  Its leaders were predominantly associated with the liberal wing of the [[progressive movement]], and most were [[Liberal Christianity|theologically liberal]]. Important leaders included [[Richard T. Ely]], [[Josiah Strong]], [[Washington Gladden]], and [[Walter Rauschenbusch]].  Many politicians came under its influence, notably [[William Jennings Bryan]] and [[Woodrow Wilson]]. The most controversial Social Gospel reform was  [[Prohibition in the United States|prohibition]], which was highly popular in rural areas \u2013 including the South \u2013 and unpopular in the larger cities where mainline Protestantism was weak among the electorate.<ref>Christopher H.

[[William Bell Riley]] took the initiative in the 1925 [[Scopes Trial]] by bringing in famed politician [[William Jennings Bryan]] as an assistant to the local prosecutor, Bryan drew national media attention to the trial. In the half century after the Scopes Trial, fundamentalists had little success in shaping government policy, and they were generally defeated in their efforts to reshape the [[Mainline Protestant|mainline denominations]], which refused to join fundamentalist attacks on evolution. Particularly after the Scopes Trial, liberals saw a division between Christians in favor of the teaching of evolution, whom they viewed as educated and tolerant, and Christians against evolution, whom they viewed as narrow-minded, tribal, obscurantist.<ref>David Goetz, \"The Monkey Trial\".

After Scopes was convicted, creationists throughout the United States sought similar antievolution laws for their states. They sought to ban evolution as a topic for study, or at least relegate it to the status of unproven theory perhaps taught alongside the biblical version of creation. Educators, scientists, and other distinguished laymen favored evolution. This struggle occurred later in the Southwest than in other US areas and persisted through the Sputnik era.<ref>George E.

Handy identifies a religious depression in the United States starting around 1925, that only grew worse during the economic depression which began in 1929. The identification of Protestantism with American culture undermined the religious messages. The fundamentalist churches said over expanded and were financially troubled. The mainstream churches were well enough financed in the late 1920s, but lost their self-confidence in terms of whether their social gospel was needed in an age of prosperity, especially since the great reform of prohibition was a failure. In terms of their network of international missions, the mainstream churches realized that the missions were a success in terms of opening modern schools and hospitals but a failure in terms of conversions. The leading theorist Daniel Fleming proclaimed that the continents for Christian outreach and Christian .conquest were no longer Africa and Asia, but rather, materialism, racial injustice, war and poverty. The number of missionaries from mainstream denominations began a steep decline.  By contrast, the evangelical and fundamentalist churches--never wedded to the social gospel-- escalated their efforts worldwide with a focus on conversion.<ref>William R.

Suddenly in 1932-33, the mainline churches lost one of their historic functions in distributing alms to the poor, and the national government took over that role without any religious dimension.  Handy argues that the deep self-doubt the religious revivals customary in times of economic depression was absent in the 1930s.  He concludes that Great Depression marked the end of the dominance of Protestantism in American life.<ref>Robert T.

Only a minority of religious leaders, typified by [[Reinhold Niebuhr]], paid serious attention to the threats to peace posed by Nazi Germany, Fascist Italy, or militaristic Japan.  After Pearl Harbor in December 1941, practically all the religious denominations gave some support to the war effort, such as providing chaplains. The pacifist churches, such as the Quakers and Mennonites were small but maintained their opposition to military service. Many young members, such as [[Richard Nixon]] voluntarily joining the military. Unlike in 1917-1918, the positions were generally respected by the government, which set up non-combat civilian roles for [[conscientious objectors]]. Typically, church members sent their sons into the military without protest, accepted shortages and rationing as a war necessity, purchased war bonds, working munitions industries, and prayed intensely for safe return and for victory. Church leaders, however, were much more cautious while holding fast to the ideals of peace, justice and humanitarianism, and sometimes criticizing military policies such as the bombing of enemy cities. They sponsored 10,000 military chaplains, and set up special ministries in and around military bases, focused not only on soldiers but their young wives who often followed them. The mainstream Protestant churches supported the \"[[Double V campaign]]\" of the black churches to achieve victory against the enemies abroad, and victory against racism on the home front. However, there was little religious protest against the incarceration of Japanese on the West Coast or against segregation of Blacks in the services. The intense moral outrage regarding the Holocaust largely appeared after the war ended, especially after 1960. Many church leaders supported studies of postwar peace proposals, typified by [[John Foster Dulles]], a leading Protestant layman and a leading adviser to top-level Republicans. The churches promoted strong support for European relief programs, especially through the United Nations.<ref> John  P.

Among other matters, note the following: the form of oath universally prevailing, concluding with an appeal to the Almighty; the custom of opening sessions of all deliberative bodies and most conventions with prayer; the prefatory words of all wills, \"In the name of God, amen\"; the laws respecting the observance of the Sabbath, with the general cessation of all secular business, and the closing of courts, legislatures, and other similar public assemblies on that day; the churches and church organizations which abound in every city, town, and hamlet; the multitude of charitable organizations existing everywhere under Christian auspices; the gigantic missionary associations, with general support, and aiming to establish Christian missions in every quarter of the globe. These, and many other matters which might be noticed, add a volume of unofficial declarations to the mass of organic utterances that this is a Christian nation....There is no dissonance in these declarations. There is a universal language pervading them all, having one meaning. They affirm and reaffirm that this is a religious nation. These are not individual sayings, declarations of private persons. They are organic utterances.

Restorationists do not usually describe themselves as \"reforming\" a Christian church continuously existing from the time of Jesus, but as ''restoring'' the Church that they believe was lost at some point. \"Restorationism\" is often used to describe the Stone-Campbell [[Restoration Movement]].

After publishing the [[Book of Mormon]]\u2014which he said he translated by divine power from a record of ancient American prophets recorded on [[golden plates]]\u2014Smith organized the \"[[Church of Christ (Latter Day Saints)|Church of Christ]]\" in 1830.  He set up a [[theocracy]] at Nauvoo Illinois, and ran for president of the United States in 1844.

This law also revoked polygamists' right to vote, made them ineligible for jury service, and prohibited them from holding political office.  The subsequent 1887 [[Edmunds\u2013Tucker Act]] disincorporated the LDS Church and confiscated church assets. It also: required an anti-polygamy oath for prospective voters, jurors and public officials; mandated civil marriage licenses; disallowed [[spousal privilege]] to not testify in polygamy cases; disenfranchised women; replaced local judges with federally appointed judges; and removed local control of schools.

Dissenters moved to Canada or [[Mormon colonies in Mexico]], or into hiding in remote areas. With the polygamy issue resolved, church leaders were pardoned or had their sentences reduced, assets were restored to the church, and Utah was eventually granted statehood in 1896.

It began in 1872 with [[Charles Taze Russell]], but experienced a major schism in 1917 as [[Joseph Franklin Rutherford]] began his presidency. Rutherford gave new direction to the movement and renamed the movement \"Jehovah's witnesses\"<!--lower case \"w\" is correct--> in 1931.  The period from 1925 to 1933 saw many significant changes in doctrine. Attendance at their yearly [[Jehovah's Witnesses practices#Memorial of Christ's death|Memorial]] dropped from a high of 90,434 in 1925 to 63,146 in 1935.

They won significant Supreme Court victories involving the rights of [[Freedom of speech|free speech]] and [[Freedom of religion|religion]] that have had a great impact on legal interpretation of these rights for others.<ref>Patrick J.

Legal troubles sometimes result when they forbid medical treatment of their children.<ref>Stephen Gottschalk, ''The Emergence of Christian Science in American Religious Life'' 1973)</ref>\n\nThe Church is unique among American denominations in several ways.  It is highly centralized, with all the local churches merely branches of the mother church in Boston. There are no ministers, but there are practitioners who are integral to the movement. The practitioners operate local businesses that help members heal their illnesses by the power of the mind. They depend for their clientele on the approval of the Church. Starting in the late 19th century the Church has rapidly lost membership, although it does not publish statistics. Its flagship newspaper ''Christian Science Monitor'' lost most of its subscribers and dropped its paper version to become an online source.<ref>Stephen Gottschalk, \"Christian Science Polity in Crisis,\" ''The Christian Century'' Volume: 110.

In 1995, it renounced its 1845 origins in the defense of slavery and racial superiority.\n* [[Unitarian Universalism]] - a theologically liberal religious movement founded in 1961 from the union of the well established [[Unitarianism|Unitarian]] and [[Universalist]] churches.\n* [[United Church of Christ]] - formed in 1957 as a [[united and uniting churches|united and uniting]] church from a merger of the [[Congregational Christian Church]] and [[Evangelical and Reformed Church]]. Congregations participating in the merger descended from Congregationalist churches of New England, German Lutheran and Reformed Churches largely from the Midwest, and various of [[Campbellite]], [[Christian Connection|Christian Connexion]] and [[Christians (Stone Movement)|\"Christian\"]] churches. \n* [[Cumberland Presbyterian Church]] - founded in 1810 in [[Dickson County, Tennessee]] by [[Samuel McAdow]], [[Finis Ewing]], and [[Samuel King (minister)|Samuel King]].\n\n==Benevolent and missionary societies==\n[[Benevolent society|Benevolent societies]] were an extremely new and conspicuous feature of the American landscape during the first half of the 19th century. Originally devoted to the salvation of souls, they eventually focused on the eradication of every kind of social ill. Benevolent societies were the direct result of the extraordinary energies generated by the evangelical movement\u2014specifically, by the \"activism\" resulting from conversion. \"The evidence of God's grace,\" Presbyterian evangelist [[Charles Grandison Finney]] insisted, \"was a person's benevolence toward others.\"<ref>Dwight Burlingame, ed. ''Philanthropy in America: a comprehensive historical encyclopedia'' (2004)</ref>\n\nThe evangelical establishment used this powerful network of voluntary, ecumenical benevolent societies to Christianize the nation. The earliest and most important of these organizations focused their efforts on the conversion of sinners to the new birth or to the creation of conditions (such as sobriety sought by [[Temperance movement|temperance societies]]) in which conversions could occur. The six largest societies in 1826\u201327 were: the American Education Society, the [[American Board of Commissioners for Foreign Missions]], the [[American Bible Society]], the [[American Sunday School Union]], the [[American Tract Society]], and the [[American Home Missionary Society]].\n\nMost denominations operated missions abroad (and some to Indians and Asians in the US).

Grant was determined to divide Native American post appointments \"up among the religious churches\"; by 1872, 73 Indian agencies were divided among religious denominations.<ref> Francis Paul Prucha, ''The Great Father: The United States Government and the American Indians'' (1984), pp. 501\u2013503.</ref> A core policy was to put the western reservations under the control of religious denominations.  In 1872, of the 73 agencies assigned, the Methodists received 14 reservations; the Orthodox Quakers ten; the Presbyterians nine; the Episcopalians eight; the Catholics seven; the Hicksite Quakers  six; the Baptists five; the Dutch Reformed five; the Congregationalists three; the Disciples two; Unitarians two; [[American Board of Commissioners for Foreign Missions]] one; and Lutherans one. The selection criteria were vague and some critics saw the Peace Policy as violating Native American freedom of religion. Catholics wanted a bigger role and set up the [[Bureau of Catholic Indian Missions]] in 1874. The Peace Policy remained in force until 1881.<ref>Francis Paul Prucha, ''American Indian Policy in Crisis, Christian Reformers and the Indian, 1865\u20131900'' (2014) pp. 30\u201371.</ref>  Historian Cary Collins says Grant's Peace Policy, failed in the Pacific Northwest chiefly because of sectarian competition and the priority placed on proselytizing by the religious denominations.<ref>Cary C.

From 1886 to 1926 the most active recruiting agency was the Student Volunteer Movement for Foreign Missions (SVM), which used its base on campus YMCAs to appeal to enlist over 8,000 young Protestants. The idea quickly was copied by the new World's Student Christian Federation (WSCF), with strength in  Great Britain, and Europe, and even as far as Australia, India, China and Japan.  Preliminary training at first focus on a deep understanding of the Bible; only later was it  appreciated that effective missionaries had to understand the language and the culture.<ref> Bill Pitts, \"Recruiting for Missions: The Baylor Volunteer Foreign Mission Band, 1900\u20131906,\" ''Baptist History and Heritage'' (2008) 43#1 [https://www.questia.com/article/1G1-179348761/recruiting-for-missions-the-baylor-volunteer-foreign online]</ref><ref>Michael Parker, ''The Kingdom of Character: The Student Volunteer Movement for Foreign Missions, 1886\u20131926'' (1998) </ref><ref> Latourette, 4:95\u2013102 </ref>  Important leaders included [[John Mott]]  (1865\u20131955; the head of the YMCA), [[Robert E.

If the Church can give it to them, plus Christianity, they will take it; otherwise they will get it elsewhere, without Christianity\u2014and that speedily.

The Commission's report, ''Re-Thinking Missions: A Laymen's Inquiry After One Hundred Years'' (1932) and known as the \"Hocking report,\" reflected changing ideas about the wisdom of a reduced role for western missionaries.

In the Thirteen colonies, Catholicism was introduced with the settling of [[Maryland]] in 1634; this colony offered a rare example of [[religious toleration]] in a fairly intolerant age.

However, at the time of the [[American Revolution]], Catholics formed less than one percent of the white population of the thirteen states.<ref>In his report on the state of Catholicism, [[John Carroll (bishop)|John Carroll]] in 1785 estimated the Catholic population in the 13 states was 25,000; the 1790 Census counted four million Americans.

Sarna, ''American Judaism: A History'' (2004)</ref>\n\n==Church and state issues==\n{{main article|Establishment Clause of the First Amendment|Free Exercise Clause of the First Amendment}}\n\n===Establishment in colonial era===\nEarly [[Immigration to the United States|immigrants]] to the [[Thirteen Colonies|American colonies]] were motivated largely by the desire to [[worship]] freely in their own fashion, particularly after the [[English Civil War]], but also religious wars and disputes in France and Germany.<ref>''The Cousins' Wars'', Kevin Phillips, 1999</ref>  They included numerous [[Nonconformist (Protestantism)|nonconformist]]s such as the [[Puritan]]s and the [[Pilgrim (Plymouth Colony)|Pilgrims]], as well as [[Roman Catholic Church|Roman Catholics]] (in [[Baltimore]]). Despite a common background, the groups' views on broader [[religious toleration]] were mixed. While some notable examples such as [[Roger Williams (theologian)|Roger Williams]] of [[Rhode Island]] and [[William Penn]] ensured the protection of religious minorities within their colonies, others such as the [[Plymouth Colony]] and [[Massachusetts Bay Colony]] had established churches. The Dutch colony of the [[New Netherlands]] had also established the [[Dutch Reformed Church]] and outlawed all other worship, although enforcement by the [[Dutch West India Company]] in the last years of the colony was sparse.  Part of the reason for establishment was financial: the established Church was responsible for [[poor relief]], and dissenting churches would therefore have a significant advantage.\n\nThere were also opponents to the support of any established church even at the state level.  In 1773, [[Isaac Backus]], a prominent Baptist minister in [[New England]], observed that when \"church and state are separate, the effects are happy, and they do not at all interfere with each other: but where they have been confounded together, no tongue nor pen can fully describe the mischiefs that have ensued.\"  Thomas Jefferson's influential [[Virginia Statute for Religious Freedom]] was enacted in 1786, five years before the [[United States Bill of Rights|Bill of Rights]].\n\nMost Anglican ministers, and many Anglicans outside the South, were [[Loyalist (American Revolution)|Loyalists]]. The Anglican Church was disestablished during the Revolution, and following the separation from Britain was reorganized as the independent [[Episcopal Church (United States)|Episcopal Church]].\n\n===Establishment Clause===\nThe [[Establishment Clause of the First Amendment|Establishment Clause]] of the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution]] reads, \"Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof . . .\" In a letter written in 1802, [[Thomas Jefferson]] used the phrase \"[[separation of church and state]]\" to describe the combined effect of the Establishment Clause and the [[Free Exercise Clause of the First Amendment]]. Though \"separation of church and state\" does not appear in the Constitution, it has since been quoted in several opinions handed down by the [[United States Supreme Court]].<ref>Jefferson's Danbury letter has been cited favorably by the Supreme Court many times. In its 1879 [[Reynolds v. United States]] decision the high court said Jefferson's observations 'may be accepted almost as an authoritative declaration of the scope and effect of the [First] Amendment.' In the court's 1947 [[Everson v. Board of Education]] decision, Justice [[Hugo Black]] wrote, 'In the words of Thomas Jefferson, the clause against establishment of religion by law was intended to erect a wall of separation between church and state.'</ref>\n\n[[Robert N. Bellah]] has argued in his writings that although the separation of church and state is grounded firmly in the constitution of the United States, this does not mean that there is no religious dimension in the political society of the United States. He used the term [[Civil Religion]] to describe the specific relation between politics and religion in the United States. His 1967 article analyzes the inaugural speech of [[John F. Kennedy]]: ''\"Considering the separation of church and state, how is a president justified in using the word 'God' at all? The answer is that the separation of church and state has not denied the political realm a religious dimension.\"<ref>{{Cite journal\n| first =Robert Neelly\n| last =Bellah\n| authorlink =Robert N.

There are allegations of [[discrimination against atheists]] in the United States.\n\n====Jefferson, Madison, and the \"wall of separation\"====\nThe phrase a \"hedge or ''wall of separation'' between the garden of the church and the wilderness of the world\" was first used by Baptist theologian [[Roger Williams (theologian)|Roger Williams]], the founder of the colony of Rhode Island.<ref>Feldman, Noah (2005). ''Divided by God''. p. 24 (\"Williams's metaphor was rediscovered by [[Isaac Backus]], a New England Baptist of Jefferson's generation, who believed, like Williams, that an established church\u2014which he considered to exist in the Massachusetts of his day\u2014would never protect religious dissenters like himself and must be opposed in order to keep religion pure.\")</ref>  It was later used by Jefferson as a commentary on the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]] and its restriction on the legislative branch of the federal government, in an 1802 letter.\n\nJefferson's and Madison's conceptions of ''separation'' have long been debated.  Jefferson refused to issue Proclamations of Thanksgiving sent to him by Congress during his presidency, though he did issue a Thanksgiving and Prayer proclamation as Governor of Virginia and vetoed two bills on the grounds they violated the first amendment.\n\nAfter retiring from the presidency, Madison argued in his detached memoranda<ref>[http://press-pubs.uchicago.edu/founders/documents/amendI_religions64.html James Madison's Detached Memoranda]</ref> for a stronger separation of church and state, opposing the very presidential issuing of religious proclamations he himself had done, and also opposing the appointment of chaplains to Congress.\n\nJefferson's opponents said his position meant the rejection of Christianity, but this was a caricature. In setting up the University of Virginia, Jefferson encouraged all the separate sects to have preachers of their own, though there was a constitutional ban on the State supporting a Professorship of Divinity, arising from his own [[Virginia Statute for Religious Freedom]].<ref>Dumas Malone, ''Jefferson and his Times'' 6:393</ref>\n\n====Test acts====\n{{main article|No religious test clause}}\nThe absence of an establishment of religion did not necessarily imply that all men were free to hold office. Most colonies had a [[Test Act]], and several states retained them for a short time.  This stood in contrast to the Federal Constitution, which explicitly prohibits the employment of any religious test for Federal office, and which through the Fourteenth Amendment later extended this prohibition to the States.<ref>Bradley, Gerard V. \"No Religious Test Clause and the Constitution of Religious Liberty: A Machine That Has Gone of Itself, The.\" ''Case Western Reserve Law Review'' 37 (1986): 674. [http://scholarship.law.nd.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1066&context=law_faculty_scholarship online]</ref>\n\n[[Article Six of the United States Constitution]] provides that  \"no [[religious test|religious Test]] shall ever be required as a Qualification to any Office or public Trust under the United States\".  Prior to the inclusion of the Bill of Rights, this was the only mention of religious freedom in the Constitution.\n\n===First Amendment===\nThe first amendment to the US Constitution states \"Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof\" The two parts, known as the \"establishment clause\" and the \"free exercise clause\" respectively, form the textual basis for the Supreme Court's interpretations of the \"separation of church and state\" doctrine.\n\nOn August 15, 1789 Madison said, \"he apprehended the meaning of the words to be, that Congress should not establish a religion, and enforce the legal observation of it by law, nor compel men to worship God in any manner contrary to their conscience....\u201d<ref>[http://press-pubs.uchicago.edu/founders/documents/amendI_religions53.html The Founders' Constitution]\nVolume 5, Amendment I (Religion), Document 53.  The University of Chicago Press, retrieved 8/9/07.</ref>\n\nAll states disestablished religion by 1833; Massachusetts was the last state. This ended the practice of allocating taxes to churches.\n\n===Supreme Court since 1947===\n{{Main|School prayer#United States}}\nThe phrase ''\"separation of church and state\"'' became a definitive part of Establishment Clause [[jurisprudence]] in ''[[Everson v. Board of Education]]'', 330 U.S. 1 (1947), a case that dealt with a state law that allowed government funds for transportation to religious schools.  While the ruling upheld the state law allowing taxpayer funding of transportation to religious schools as constitutional, ''Everson'' was also the first case to hold the Establishment Clause applicable to the state legislatures as well as Congress, based upon the [[due process]] clause of the [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourteenth Amendment]].<ref name=\"Jonathan A. Wright 2010\">Jonathan A. Wright, ''Separation of Church and State'' (2010)</ref>\n\nIn 1949 Bible reading was a part of routine in the public schools of at least thirty-seven states. In twelve of these states, Bible reading was legally required by state laws; 11 states passed these laws after 1913. In 1960, 42 per cent of school districts nationwide tolerated or required Bible reading, and 50 per cent reported some form of homeroom daily devotional exercise. <ref>Adam Laats, \"Our schools, our country: American evangelicals, public schools, and the Supreme Court decisions of 1962 and 1963.\" ''Journal of religious history'' 36.3 (2012): 319-334 at p 321-22.</ref>\n\nSince 1962, the Supreme Court has repeatedly ruled that prayers organized by public school officials schools are unconstitutional. Students are allowed to pray privately, and to join religious clubs after school hours. Colleges, universities, and private schools are not affected by the Supreme Court rulings.  Reactions to ''Engel'' and ''Abington'' were widely negative, with over 150 constitutional amendments submitted to reverse the policy. None passed Congress.<ref>Geoffrey R. Stone, \"In Opposition to the School Prayer Amendment.\" ''University of Chicago Law Review'' 50 (1983): 823-848.  [http://chicagounbound.uchicago.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=4338&context=uclrev online].</ref>  It is a matter of the government promoting an establishment of religion. The Supreme Court has also ruled that so-called \"voluntary\" school prayers are also unconstitutional, because they force some students to be outsiders to the main group, and because they subject dissenters to intense peer group pressure. In [[Lee v. Weisman]] The Supreme Court held in 1992:\n:the State may not place the student dissenter in the dilemma of participating or protesting. Since adolescents are often susceptible to peer pressure, especially in matters of social convention, the State may no more use social pressure to enforce orthodoxy than it may use direct means. The embarrassment and intrusion of the religious exercise cannot be refuted by arguing that the prayers are of a de minimis character, since that is an affront to ...those for whom the prayers have meaning, and since any intrusion was both real and a violation of the objectors' rights.<ref>{{cite book|author1=Robert Palestini |author2=Karen Palestini Falk|title=Law and American Education: An Instructor's Guide|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RhP3CT4P2-AC&pg=PA33|year=2002|publisher=R&L Education|page=33|isbn=9781461731634}}</ref><ref>505 U.S. 577, Syllabus.</ref>\n\nIn 1962, the Supreme Court extended this analysis to the issue of prayer in public schools.  In [[Engel v. Vitale]] 370 U.S. 421 (1962), the Court determined it unconstitutional for state officials to compose an official school prayer and require its recitation in public schools, even when it is non-denominational and students may excuse themselves from participation.  As such, any teacher, faculty, or student can pray in school, in accordance with their own religion.  However, they may not lead such prayers in class, or in other \"official\" school settings such as assemblies or programs.\n\nCurrently, the Supreme Court applies a three-pronged test to determine whether legislation comports with the Establishment Clause, known as the \"[[Lemon Test]]\". First, the legislature must have adopted the law with a neutral or non-religious purpose. Second, the statute's principal or primary effect must be one that neither advances nor inhibits religion. Third, the statute must not result in an excessive entanglement of government with religion.<ref name=\"Jonathan A.

Since the 1850s, they have been the [[History of the United States Democratic Party|Democratic Party]] and the [[History of the United States Republican Party|Republican Party]]. This [[two-party system]] is based on laws, party rules and custom. Various small minor parties come and go and occasionally win major offices at the state level. Local offices, however, are often nonpartisan.\n\n== Overview ==\nThe need to win popular support in a [[Republicanism in the United States|republic]] led to the American invention of voter-based political parties in the 1790s.<ref>{{cite book |author=Roy Franklin Nichols|title=The invention of the American political parties|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=34g0AAAAIAAJ|year=1967|publisher=Macmillan}}</ref> Americans were especially innovative in devising new campaign techniques that linked public opinion with public policy through the party.<ref>Robert J. Dinkin,  ''Campaigning in America: A History of Election Practices.'' [https://www.questia.com/PM.qst?a=o&d=14291969 (Greenwood 1989) online version]</ref>\n\nPolitical scientists and historians have divided the development of America's two-party system into five eras.<ref>Paul Kleppner, et al. ''The Evolution of American Electoral Systems'' (1983),</ref> The first two-party system consisted of the [[Federalist Party]], who supported the ratification of the Constitution, and the [[Democratic-Republican Party]] or the [[Anti-Administration party]] (Anti-Federalists), who opposed the powerful central government, among others, that the Constitution established when it took effect in 1789.<ref>{{cite web | title=The First Political Parties: Federalists and Anti-Federalists | work=Boundless Political Science | publisher=Boundless.com | date=May 26, 2016 | accessdate=July 27, 2016 | url=https://www.boundless.com/political-science/textbooks/boundless-political-science-textbook/interest-groups-7/the-history-of-political-parties-55/the-first-political-parties-federalists-and-anti-federalists-316-1572/ }}</ref>\n\nThe modern two-party system consists of the [[History of the Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]] and the [[History of the Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]]. Several [[Third party (United States)|third parties]] also operate in the U.S., and from time to time elect someone to local office.<ref>William B. Hesseltine, ''Third-Party Movements in the United States'' (1962)</ref> The largest third party since the 1980s has been the [[Libertarian Party (United States)|Libertarian Party]].\n\nBesides the [[Constitution Party (United States)|Constitution]], [[Green Party of the United States|Green]], and Libertarian parties, there are [[List of political parties in the United States|many other political parties]] that receive only minimal support and only appear on the ballot in one or a few states.\n\nSome political candidates, and many voters, choose not to identify with a particular political party. In some states, [[Independent voter#In the United States|independents]] are not allowed to vote in primary elections, but in others, they can vote in any primary election of their choice. Although the term \"independent\" often is used as a synonym for \"moderate,\" \"centrist,\" or \"swing voter,\" to refer to a politician or voter who holds views that incorporate facets of both liberal and conservative ideologies, most self-described independents consistently support one of the two major parties when it comes time to vote, according to [[Vox Media]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.vox.com/2016/1/22/10814522/independents-voters-facts-myths|title=9 media myths about independent voters, debunked|last=Klar|first=Samara|date=2016-01-22|website=Vox|access-date=2019-03-07}}</ref>\n\n== History and early political parties ==\n[[File:PartyVotes-Presidents.png|thumb|right|400px|Popular votes to political parties during presidential elections.]]\n[[File:Political Parties Derivation in the United States.svg|thumb|400px|Political parties derivation. Dotted line means unofficially.]]\n\nThe [[United States Constitution]] is silent on the subject of political parties. The [[Founding Fathers of the United States|Founding Fathers]] did not originally intend for American politics to be partisan. In [[Federalist No. 9|Federalist Papers No. 9]] and [[Federalist No. 10|No. 10]], [[Alexander Hamilton]] and [[James Madison]], respectively, wrote specifically about the dangers of domestic [[political faction]]s. In addition, the first [[President of the United States]], [[George Washington]], was not a member of any political party at the time of his election or throughout his tenure as president. Furthermore, he hoped that political parties would not be formed, fearing conflict and stagnation, as outlined in his [[George Washington's Farewell Address|Farewell Address]].<ref>{{cite WS|title=Washington's Farewell Address|link=Washington's Farewell Address#20}}</ref>\n\nNevertheless, the beginnings of the American [[two-party system]] emerged from his immediate circle of advisers. Hamilton and Madison, who wrote the aforementioned Federalist Papers against political factions, ended up being the core leaders in this emerging party system. It was the split camps of Federalists, given rise with Hamilton as a leader, and Democratic-Republicans, with Madison and [[Thomas Jefferson]]  at the helm of this political faction, that created the environment in which partisanship, once distasteful, came to being.<ref>Richard Hofstadter, ''The Idea of a Party System: The Rise of Legitimate Opposition in the United States, 1780\u20131840'' (1970)</ref><ref>Gordon S. Wood, ''Empire of Liberty: A History of the Early Republic, 1789\u20131815 (Oxford History of the United States)''</ref>\n\n=== First Party System: 1792\u20131824 ===\n{{Main|First Party System}}\nThe First Party System of the United States featured the [[Federalist Party (United States)|Federalist Party]] and the [[Democratic-Republican Party (United States)|Democratic-Republican Party]] (also called \"Jeffersonian Republican\"). The Federalist Party grew from the national network of Washington's Secretary of the Treasury, [[Alexander Hamilton]], who favored a strong united central government, close ties to Britain, a centralized banking system, and close links between the government and men of wealth.\n\nThe Democratic-Republican Party was founded by Madison and Thomas Jefferson, who strongly opposed Hamilton's agenda.<ref>William Nisbet Chambers, ed. ''The First Party System'' (1972)</ref> The [[Jeffersonian democracy|Jeffersonians]] came to power in 1800 and the Federalists were too elitist to compete effectively. The Federalists survived in the Northeast, but their refusal to support the [[War of 1812]] verged on secession and was a devastating blow when the war ended well. The [[Era of Good Feelings]] under [[James Monroe|President James Monroe]] (1816\u20131824) marked the end of the First Party System and a brief period in which partisanship was minimal.<ref>George Dangerfield, ''The Era of Good Feelings'' (1952)</ref>\n\n=== Second Party System: 1828\u20131854 ===\n{{Main|Second Party System}}\n\nThe Second Party System operated from about 1828 to 1854, following the splintering of the Democratic-Republican Party. Two major parties dominated the political landscape: the [[Whig Party (United States)|Whig Party]], led by [[Henry Clay]], that grew from the [[National Republican Party (United States)|National Republican Party]];  and the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]], led by [[Andrew Jackson]]. The Democrats supported the primacy of the Presidency over the other branches of government, and opposed both the [[Second Bank of the United States|Bank of the United States]] as well as modernizing programs that they felt would build up [[industry]] at the expense of the [[taxpayer]].\n\nThe Whigs, on the other hand, advocated the primacy of [[United States Congress|Congress]] over the [[Executive (government)|executive branch]] as well as policies of modernization and economic protectionism. Central political battles of this era were the [[Bank War]] and the [[Spoils system]] of federal patronage.<ref>{{Cite journal |jstor = 3123555|title = Politics and Society: Toward a Jacksonian Synthesis|journal = Journal of the Early Republic|volume = 10|issue = 2|pages = 135\u2013161|last1 = Feller|first1 = Daniel|year = 1990|doi = 10.2307/3123555}}</ref> The 1850s saw the collapse of the Whig party, largely as a result of decline in its leadership and a major intra-party split over slavery as a result of the [[Kansas-Nebraska Act]]. In addition, the fading of old economic issues removed many of the unifying forces holding the party together.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" align=\"right\" style=\"margin-left:1em; text-align:center\"\n|+ [[List of United States presidential elections by popular vote margin|Presidential election victories]] by party system<ref>Using the definitions of: First Party System: 1796\u20131824, Second Party System: 1828\u20131852, Third Party System: 1856\u20131892, Fourth Party System: 1896\u20131928, Fifth Party System: 1932\u20131964, Sixth Party System: 1968\u2013present</ref>\n|-\n!

The [[History of the United States Democratic Party|Democratic Party]] was in large part the opposition party during this period, although it often controlled the Senate or the House of Representatives, or both.\n\n[[American Civil War|Civil war]] and [[Reconstruction Era of the United States|Reconstruction]] issues polarized the parties until the [[Compromise of 1877]], which ended the latter. Thus both parties became broad-based voting coalitions and the race issue pulled newly enfranchised African Americans ([[Freedmen]]) into the Republican Party while white southerners ([[Redeemers]]) joined the Democratic Party. The Democratic coalition also had conservative pro-business [[Bourbon Democrats]], traditional Democrats in the North (many of them former [[Copperheads (politics)|Copperheads]]), and Catholic immigrants, among others. The Republican coalition also consisted of businessmen, shop owners, skilled craftsmen, clerks, and professionals who were attracted to the party's modernization policies.<ref>Paul Kleppner; Paul.

This period also corresponded to the [[Progressive Era]], and was dominated by the Republican Party. It began after the Republicans blamed the Democrats for the [[Panic of 1893]], which later resulted in [[William McKinley]]'s victory over [[William Jennings Bryan]] in the [[1896 United States presidential election|1896 presidential election]].\n\nThe central domestic issues changed to government regulation of railroads and large corporations (\"[[Trust (monopoly)|trusts]]\"), the protective tariff, the role of [[Trade union|labor unions]], [[child labor]], the need for a new banking system, corruption in party politics, primary elections, direct election of senators, [[racial segregation]], efficiency in government, [[women's suffrage]], and control of immigration. Most voting blocs continued unchanged, but some realignment took place, giving Republicans dominance in the industrial Northeast and new strength in the border states. Historians have long debated why no [[Labor Party of the United States|Labor Party]] emerged in the United States, in contrast to Western Europe.<ref>Robin Archer, ''Why Is There No Labor Party in the United States?'' (Princeton University Press, 2007)</ref>\n\n=== Fifth and Sixth Party Systems: 1933\u20132016 ===\n{{Main|Fifth Party System|Sixth Party System}}\nThe Fifth Party System emerged with the [[New Deal Coalition]] beginning in 1933.<ref>Richard Jensen, \"The Last Party System: Decay of Consensus, 1932\u20131980,\" in Paul Kleppner et al., ''The Evolution of American Electoral Systems (Greenwood, 1981), pp. 205\u201306.</ref> The Republicans began losing support after the [[Great Depression in the United States|Great Depression]], giving rise to Democratic President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] and the activist [[New Deal]]. They promoted American liberalism, anchored in a coalition of specific liberal groups, especially [[Ethnoreligious group|ethno-religious]] constituencies (Catholics, Jews, African Americans), white Southerners, well-organized labor unions, urban machines, progressive intellectuals, and populist farm groups.\n\nOpposition Republicans were split between a conservative wing, led by [[Ohio]] Senator [[Robert A. Taft]], and a more successful moderate wing exemplified by the politics of Northeastern leaders such as [[Nelson Rockefeller]], [[Jacob Javits]], and [[Henry Cabot Lodge, Jr.|Henry Cabot Lodge]]. The latter steadily lost influence inside the GOP after 1964.<ref>Nicol C. Rae, ''The Decline and Fall of the Liberal Republicans: From 1952 to the Present'' (1989)</ref>\n\nExperts debate whether this era ended (and a [[Sixth Party System]] subsequently emerged) in the mid-1960s when the New Deal coalition died, the early 1980s when the [[Moral Majority]] and the [[Reagan coalition]] were formed, the early 1990s when [[Third Way]] emerged among Democrats, the mid-1990s during the [[Republican Revolution]], or if the Fifth system continues in some form to the present.\n\nSince the 1930s, the Democrats positioned themselves more towards [[Liberalism in the United States|liberalism]] while [[Conservatism in the United States|conservatives]] increasingly dominated the GOP.<ref>[[Matthew Levendusky]], ''The Partisan Sort: How Liberals Became Democrats and Conservatives Became Republicans'' (U Chicago Press, 2009)</ref> However, new voter coalitions emerged during the latter half of the 20th century, with conservatives and the Republicans becoming dominant in the South, rural areas, and suburbs; while liberals and the Democrats increasingly started to rely on a coalition of African-Americans, Hispanics and white urban progressives.\n\n=== Seventh Party Systems: 2017\u2013Present ===\n{{Main|Seventh Party System}}\nWith the 2016 election, America saw a move away from politics as normal as [[Donald Trump]] upended the election process being nominated the 45th President of the US and ending the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican party]] era of [[Ronald Reagan]].{{cn|date=March 2020}}\n\n=== Minor parties and independents ===\n{{See also|Independent politician#United States}}\nAlthough American politics have been dominated by the two-party system, several other political parties have also emerged throughout the country's history. The oldest third party was the [[Anti-Masonic Party]], which was formed in upstate New York in 1828. The party's creators feared the [[Freemasonry|Freemasons]], believing they were a powerful secret society that was attempting to rule the country in defiance of republican principles.<ref>Morris, Richard B.

These two parties have won every [[United States presidential election]] since 1852 and have controlled the [[United States Congress]] to some extent [[United States Presidents and control of Congress|since at least 1856]]. There are numerous minor, or third parties. The Libertarian, Green, Reform, Independent and other parties have won elections throughout history at different levels, but the success of those parties is sparse.\n\n\n== Major parties ==\n=== Democratic Party ===\n{{Main|Democratic Party (United States)|History of the United States Democratic Party}}\nThe Democratic Party is one of two major political parties in the U.S.  Founded as the [[Democratic-Republican Party]] in 1792 by [[Thomas Jefferson]] and [[James Madison]],<ref>{{cite book|last=Warren|first=Kenneth F.|title=Encyclopedia of U.S. campaigns, elections, and electoral behavior: A-M|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zP4wDcT3PeQC|year=2008|publisher=SAGE|isbn=978-1-4129-5489-1|page=[https://books.google.com/books?id=zP4wDcT3PeQC&pg=PA176&dq=%22democratic+republican%22+madison+jefferson 176]}}</ref> it is the oldest extant voter-based political party in the world.<ref>{{cite book |first=Jules|last=Witcover|title=Party of the People: A History of the Democrats|url=https://archive.org/details/partyofpeoplehis00witc|url-access=registration|year=2003|chapter=1 | page=[https://archive.org/details/partyofpeoplehis00witc/page/n0 3]}} \"The Democratic Party of the United States, the oldest existing in the world....\"</ref><ref>{{cite book | first=John | last=Micklethwait | authorlink=John Micklethwait|author2=Wooldridge, Adrian | title=The Right Nation: Conservative Power in America | url=https://archive.org/details/rightnationconse00mick | url-access=registration | year=2004 | page=[https://archive.org/details/rightnationconse00mick/page/15 15]}} \"The country possesses the world's oldest written constitution (1787); the Democratic Party has a good claim to being the world's oldest political party.\"</ref>\n\nThe Democratic Party at its founding supported a different set of issues than it presently supports.  From its founding until the mid-20th century, the Democratic Party was the dominant party among white southerners, and as such, was then the party most associated with the defense of slavery. However, following the [[Great Society]] under [[Lyndon B. Johnson]], the Democratic Party became the more progressive party on issues of civil rights, while losing dominance in the Southern states to the Republicans.\n\nThe Democratic Party since 1912 has positioned itself as the liberal party on domestic issues. The economic philosophy of [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]], which has strongly influenced [[Modern liberalism in the United States|modern American liberalism]], has shaped much of the party's agenda since 1932. Roosevelt's [[New Deal coalition]] controlled the White House until 1968, with the exception of the two terms of [[Dwight D. Eisenhower|President Eisenhower]] from 1953\u20131961. Since the mid-20th century, Democrats have generally been in the [[center-left]] and currently support [[social justice]], [[social liberalism]], a [[mixed economy]], and the [[welfare state]], although [[Bill Clinton]] and other [[New Democrats]] have pushed for [[free trade]] and [[neoliberalism]], which is seen to have shifted the party rightwards. Democrats are currently strongest in the [[Northeast of the United States|Northeast]] and [[West Coast of the United States|West Coast]] and in major American urban centers.  African-Americans and Latinos tend to be disproportionately Democratic, as do [[trade union]]s.\n\nIn 2004, it was the largest political party, with 72 million registered voters (42.6% of 169 million registered) claiming affiliation.<ref name=\"Neuhart20040122\">{{cite news\n|url=https://www.usatoday.com/news/opinion/columnist/neuharth/2004-01-22-neuharth_x.htm\n|last=Neuhart|first=Al|title=Why politics is fun from catbirds' seats|work=USA Today|accessdate=2007-07-11 | date=January 22, 2004}}</ref> Although his party lost the election for president in 2004, [[Barack Obama]] would later go on to become president in 2009 and continue to be the president until January 2017.  Obama was the 15th Democrat to hold the office, and from the [[United States general elections, 2006|2006 midterm elections]] until the [[United States elections, 2014|2014 midterm elections]], the Democratic Party was also the [[Two-party system|majority party]] in the [[United States Senate]].\n\nA 2011 ''[[USA Today]]'' review of state voter rolls indicates that the number of registered Democrats declined in 25 of 28 states (some states do not register voters by party). During this time, Republican registration also declined, as independent or no preference voting was on the rise.  But in 2011 Democrats numbers shrank 800,000, and from 2008 they were down by 1.7 million, or 3.9%.<ref name=\"Wolf\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.usatoday.com/news/politics/story/2011-12-22/voters-political-parties/52171688/1|title=Voters leaving Republican, Democratic parties in droves|author=Wolf, Richard|first=|date=December 22, 2011|work=USA Today|archive-url=|archive-date=|accessdate=June 20, 2012}}</ref>\n\n=== Republican Party ===\n{{Main|Republican Party (United States)|History of the United States Republican Party}}\nThe Republican Party is one of the two major contemporary political parties in the United States of America. Since the 1880s it has been nicknamed (by the media) the \"Grand Old Party\"  or GOP, although it is younger than the Democratic Party.\n\nFounded in 1854 by Northern anti-slavery activists and modernizers, the Republican Party rose to prominence in 1860 with the election of [[Abraham Lincoln]], who used the party machinery to support victory in the [[American Civil War]]. The GOP dominated national politics during the [[Third Party System]], from 1854 to 1896, and the [[Fourth Party System]] from 1896 to 1932.\n\nSince its founding, the Republican Party has been the more market-oriented of the two American political parties, often favoring policies that aid American business interests.  As a party whose power was once based on the voting power of Union Army veterans, this party has traditionally supported more aggressive defense measures and more lavish veterans' benefits. Today, the Republican Party supports an [[Conservatism in the United States|American conservative]] platform, with further foundations in [[economic liberalism]], [[fiscal conservatism]], and [[social conservatism]].  The Republican Party tends to be strongest in the [[Southern United States]] and the \"[[flyover states]]\", as well as suburban and rural areas in other states.

It was founded as the U.S. Taxpayers Party in 1992 by Howard Phillips. The party's official name was changed to the \"Constitution Party\" in 1999; however, some state affiliate parties are known under different names.\n\nThe Constitution Party is strongly pro-life (i.e. opposed to [[abortion]]), and supports [[Gun politics in the United States|gun rights]], and restrictions on immigration. It calls for protectionist trade policies.\n\nIn 2006, [[Rick Jore]] of [[Montana]] became the first Constitution Party candidate elected to a state-level office,<ref>[http://sos.mt.gov/ELB/archives/2006/elections/general/house/hd12/index.asp \"State Legislature results\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061116040533/http://sos.mt.gov/ELB/archives/2006/elections/general/house/hd12/index.asp |date=2006-11-16 }}, ''Missoulian'', November 8, 2006, retrieved November 8, 2006</ref><ref>[http://www.helenair.com/articles/2006/11/09/montana/a01110906_02.txt Control of state Legislature unclear], ''Helena Independent Record''</ref> though the Constitution Party of Montana had disaffiliated itself from the national party a short time before the election.\n\nIn 2010 former Congressman [[Tom Tancredo]] was the Constitution Party candidate for governor of [[Colorado]], coming in second with 617,030 votes, 36.4% and ahead of the Republican candidate, Dan Maes, with 11.1%.\n\nThe Constitution Party's 2012 presidential nominee was former Congressman [[Virgil Goode]] of Virginia.\n\nTennessee Attorney [[Darrell Castle]] was the 2016 Constitution Party nominee for President of the United States and Scott Bradley of Utah was the nominee for Vice President.\n\n== Issues ==\n{{See also|Left\u2013right politics#Contemporary usage in the United States|label 1=Usage of \"left\u2013right\" politics in the United States|Politics of the United States#Organization of American political parties|label 2=Organization of American political parties}}\n\nBecause American political parties are more loosely organized than those in other countries, not all members of a party subscribe to all of the officially held positions in their respective [[party platform|party's platform]]. The usual degree of variation generally is higher for the larger parties. Party members may hold different views on legislation to be enacted at the state or federal levels, and an elected official once in office may act contradictory to many of his or her party's positions (this has led to terms such as \"[[Republican In Name Only]]\" and \"[[Democrat In Name Only]]\" \u2013 RINO and DINO, respectively). Furthermore, the modern American [[political spectrum]], and the usage of [[left\u2013right politics]], differs from the rest of the world. For example, the Democratic Party, the primary left-of-center party in the country, generally supports a [[social liberal]] position rather than a [[social democratic]] one, though there are exceptions.\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n== Further reading ==\n* Critchlow, Donald T.

This [[two-party system]] is based on laws, party rules and custom. Various small minor parties come and go and occasionally win major offices at the state level. Local offices, however, are often nonpartisan.\n\n== Overview ==\nThe need to win popular support in a [[Republicanism in the United States|republic]] led to the American invention of voter-based political parties in the 1790s.<ref>{{cite book |author=Roy Franklin Nichols|title=The invention of the American political parties|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=34g0AAAAIAAJ|year=1967|publisher=Macmillan}}</ref> Americans were especially innovative in devising new campaign techniques that linked public opinion with public policy through the party.<ref>Robert J.

''The Evolution of American Electoral Systems'' (1983),</ref> The first two-party system consisted of the [[Federalist Party]], who supported the ratification of the Constitution, and the [[Democratic-Republican Party]] or the [[Anti-Administration party]] (Anti-Federalists), who opposed the powerful central government, among others, that the Constitution established when it took effect in 1789.<ref>{{cite web | title=The First Political Parties: Federalists and Anti-Federalists | work=Boundless Political Science | publisher=Boundless.com | date=May 26, 2016 | accessdate=July 27, 2016 | url=https://www.boundless.com/political-science/textbooks/boundless-political-science-textbook/interest-groups-7/the-history-of-political-parties-55/the-first-political-parties-federalists-and-anti-federalists-316-1572/ }}</ref>\n\nThe modern two-party system consists of the [[History of the Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]] and the [[History of the Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]]. Several [[Third party (United States)|third parties]] also operate in the U.S., and from time to time elect someone to local office.<ref>William B. Hesseltine, ''Third-Party Movements in the United States'' (1962)</ref> The largest third party since the 1980s has been the [[Libertarian Party (United States)|Libertarian Party]].\n\nBesides the [[Constitution Party (United States)|Constitution]], [[Green Party of the United States|Green]], and Libertarian parties, there are [[List of political parties in the United States|many other political parties]] that receive only minimal support and only appear on the ballot in one or a few states.\n\nSome political candidates, and many voters, choose not to identify with a particular political party. In some states, [[Independent voter#In the United States|independents]] are not allowed to vote in primary elections, but in others, they can vote in any primary election of their choice. Although the term \"independent\" often is used as a synonym for \"moderate,\" \"centrist,\" or \"swing voter,\" to refer to a politician or voter who holds views that incorporate facets of both liberal and conservative ideologies, most self-described independents consistently support one of the two major parties when it comes time to vote, according to [[Vox Media]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.vox.com/2016/1/22/10814522/independents-voters-facts-myths|title=9 media myths about independent voters, debunked|last=Klar|first=Samara|date=2016-01-22|website=Vox|access-date=2019-03-07}}</ref>\n\n== History and early political parties ==\n[[File:PartyVotes-Presidents.png|thumb|right|400px|Popular votes to political parties during presidential elections.]]\n[[File:Political Parties Derivation in the United States.svg|thumb|400px|Political parties derivation. Dotted line means unofficially.]]\n\nThe [[United States Constitution]] is silent on the subject of political parties. The [[Founding Fathers of the United States|Founding Fathers]] did not originally intend for American politics to be partisan. In [[Federalist No. 9|Federalist Papers No. 9]] and [[Federalist No. 10|No. 10]], [[Alexander Hamilton]] and [[James Madison]], respectively, wrote specifically about the dangers of domestic [[political faction]]s. In addition, the first [[President of the United States]], [[George Washington]], was not a member of any political party at the time of his election or throughout his tenure as president. Furthermore, he hoped that political parties would not be formed, fearing conflict and stagnation, as outlined in his [[George Washington's Farewell Address|Farewell Address]].<ref>{{cite WS|title=Washington's Farewell Address|link=Washington's Farewell Address#20}}</ref>\n\nNevertheless, the beginnings of the American [[two-party system]] emerged from his immediate circle of advisers. Hamilton and Madison, who wrote the aforementioned Federalist Papers against political factions, ended up being the core leaders in this emerging party system. It was the split camps of Federalists, given rise with Hamilton as a leader, and Democratic-Republicans, with Madison and [[Thomas Jefferson]]  at the helm of this political faction, that created the environment in which partisanship, once distasteful, came to being.<ref>Richard Hofstadter, ''The Idea of a Party System: The Rise of Legitimate Opposition in the United States, 1780\u20131840'' (1970)</ref><ref>Gordon S. Wood, ''Empire of Liberty: A History of the Early Republic, 1789\u20131815 (Oxford History of the United States)''</ref>\n\n=== First Party System: 1792\u20131824 ===\n{{Main|First Party System}}\nThe First Party System of the United States featured the [[Federalist Party (United States)|Federalist Party]] and the [[Democratic-Republican Party (United States)|Democratic-Republican Party]] (also called \"Jeffersonian Republican\"). The Federalist Party grew from the national network of Washington's Secretary of the Treasury, [[Alexander Hamilton]], who favored a strong united central government, close ties to Britain, a centralized banking system, and close links between the government and men of wealth.\n\nThe Democratic-Republican Party was founded by Madison and Thomas Jefferson, who strongly opposed Hamilton's agenda.<ref>William Nisbet Chambers, ed. ''The First Party System'' (1972)</ref> The [[Jeffersonian democracy|Jeffersonians]] came to power in 1800 and the Federalists were too elitist to compete effectively. The Federalists survived in the Northeast, but their refusal to support the [[War of 1812]] verged on secession and was a devastating blow when the war ended well. The [[Era of Good Feelings]] under [[James Monroe|President James Monroe]] (1816\u20131824) marked the end of the First Party System and a brief period in which partisanship was minimal.<ref>George Dangerfield, ''The Era of Good Feelings'' (1952)</ref>\n\n=== Second Party System: 1828\u20131854 ===\n{{Main|Second Party System}}\n\nThe Second Party System operated from about 1828 to 1854, following the splintering of the Democratic-Republican Party. Two major parties dominated the political landscape: the [[Whig Party (United States)|Whig Party]], led by [[Henry Clay]], that grew from the [[National Republican Party (United States)|National Republican Party]];  and the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]], led by [[Andrew Jackson]]. The Democrats supported the primacy of the Presidency over the other branches of government, and opposed both the [[Second Bank of the United States|Bank of the United States]] as well as modernizing programs that they felt would build up [[industry]] at the expense of the [[taxpayer]].\n\nThe Whigs, on the other hand, advocated the primacy of [[United States Congress|Congress]] over the [[Executive (government)|executive branch]] as well as policies of modernization and economic protectionism. Central political battles of this era were the [[Bank War]] and the [[Spoils system]] of federal patronage.<ref>{{Cite journal |jstor = 3123555|title = Politics and Society: Toward a Jacksonian Synthesis|journal = Journal of the Early Republic|volume = 10|issue = 2|pages = 135\u2013161|last1 = Feller|first1 = Daniel|year = 1990|doi = 10.2307/3123555}}</ref> The 1850s saw the collapse of the Whig party, largely as a result of decline in its leadership and a major intra-party split over slavery as a result of the [[Kansas-Nebraska Act]].

The [[History of the United States Democratic Party|Democratic Party]] was in large part the opposition party during this period, although it often controlled the Senate or the House of Representatives, or both.\n\n[[American Civil War|Civil war]] and [[Reconstruction Era of the United States|Reconstruction]] issues polarized the parties until the [[Compromise of 1877]], which ended the latter. Thus both parties became broad-based voting coalitions and the race issue pulled newly enfranchised African Americans ([[Freedmen]]) into the Republican Party while white southerners ([[Redeemers]]) joined the Democratic Party. The Democratic coalition also had conservative pro-business [[Bourbon Democrats]], traditional Democrats in the North (many of them former [[Copperheads (politics)|Copperheads]]), and Catholic immigrants, among others. The Republican coalition also consisted of businessmen, shop owners, skilled craftsmen, clerks, and professionals who were attracted to the party's modernization policies.<ref>Paul Kleppner; Paul.

This period also corresponded to the [[Progressive Era]], and was dominated by the Republican Party. It began after the Republicans blamed the Democrats for the [[Panic of 1893]], which later resulted in [[William McKinley]]'s victory over [[William Jennings Bryan]] in the [[1896 United States presidential election|1896 presidential election]].\n\nThe central domestic issues changed to government regulation of railroads and large corporations (\"[[Trust (monopoly)|trusts]]\"), the protective tariff, the role of [[Trade union|labor unions]], [[child labor]], the need for a new banking system, corruption in party politics, primary elections, direct election of senators, [[racial segregation]], efficiency in government, [[women's suffrage]], and control of immigration. Most voting blocs continued unchanged, but some realignment took place, giving Republicans dominance in the industrial Northeast and new strength in the border states. Historians have long debated why no [[Labor Party of the United States|Labor Party]] emerged in the United States, in contrast to Western Europe.<ref>Robin Archer, ''Why Is There No Labor Party in the United States?''

Roosevelt]] and the activist [[New Deal]]. They promoted American liberalism, anchored in a coalition of specific liberal groups, especially [[Ethnoreligious group|ethno-religious]] constituencies (Catholics, Jews, African Americans), white Southerners, well-organized labor unions, urban machines, progressive intellectuals, and populist farm groups.\n\nOpposition Republicans were split between a conservative wing, led by [[Ohio]] Senator [[Robert A. Taft]], and a more successful moderate wing exemplified by the politics of Northeastern leaders such as [[Nelson Rockefeller]], [[Jacob Javits]], and [[Henry Cabot Lodge, Jr.|Henry Cabot Lodge]]. The latter steadily lost influence inside the GOP after 1964.<ref>Nicol C. Rae, ''The Decline and Fall of the Liberal Republicans: From 1952 to the Present'' (1989)</ref>\n\nExperts debate whether this era ended (and a [[Sixth Party System]] subsequently emerged) in the mid-1960s when the New Deal coalition died, the early 1980s when the [[Moral Majority]] and the [[Reagan coalition]] were formed, the early 1990s when [[Third Way]] emerged among Democrats, the mid-1990s during the [[Republican Revolution]], or if the Fifth system continues in some form to the present.\n\nSince the 1930s, the Democrats positioned themselves more towards [[Liberalism in the United States|liberalism]] while [[Conservatism in the United States|conservatives]] increasingly dominated the GOP.<ref>[[Matthew Levendusky]], ''The Partisan Sort: How Liberals Became Democrats and Conservatives Became Republicans'' (U Chicago Press, 2009)</ref> However, new voter coalitions emerged during the latter half of the 20th century, with conservatives and the Republicans becoming dominant in the South, rural areas, and suburbs; while liberals and the Democrats increasingly started to rely on a coalition of African-Americans, Hispanics and white urban progressives.\n\n=== Seventh Party Systems: 2017\u2013Present ===\n{{Main|Seventh Party System}}\nWith the 2016 election, America saw a move away from politics as normal as [[Donald Trump]] upended the election process being nominated the 45th President of the USA and ending the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican party]] era of [[Ronald Reagan]].{{cn|date=March 2020}}\n\n=== Minor parties and independents ===\n{{See also|Independent politician#United States}}\nAlthough American politics have been dominated by the two-party system, several other political parties have also emerged throughout the country's history. The oldest third party was the [[Anti-Masonic Party]], which was formed in upstate New York in 1828.

The Libertarian, Green, Reform, Independent and other parties have won elections throughout history at different levels, but the success of those parties is sparse.\n\n\n== Major parties ==\n=== Democratic Party ===\n{{Main|Democratic Party (United States)|History of the United States Democratic Party}}\nThe Democratic Party is one of two major political parties in the U.S.  Founded as the [[Democratic-Republican Party]] in 1792 by [[Thomas Jefferson]] and [[James Madison]],<ref>{{cite book|last=Warren|first=Kenneth F.|title=Encyclopedia of U.S. campaigns, elections, and electoral behavior: A-M|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zP4wDcT3PeQC|year=2008|publisher=SAGE|isbn=978-1-4129-5489-1|page=[https://books.google.com/books?id=zP4wDcT3PeQC&pg=PA176&dq=%22democratic+republican%22+madison+jefferson 176]}}</ref> it is the oldest extant voter-based political party in the world.<ref>{{cite book |first=Jules|last=Witcover|title=Party of the People: A History of the Democrats|url=https://archive.org/details/partyofpeoplehis00witc|url-access=registration|year=2003|chapter=1 | page=[https://archive.org/details/partyofpeoplehis00witc/page/n0 3]}} \"The Democratic Party of the United States, the oldest existing in the world....\"</ref><ref>{{cite book | first=John | last=Micklethwait | authorlink=John Micklethwait|author2=Wooldridge, Adrian | title=The Right Nation: Conservative Power in America | url=https://archive.org/details/rightnationconse00mick | url-access=registration | year=2004 | page=[https://archive.org/details/rightnationconse00mick/page/15 15]}} \"The country possesses the world's oldest written constitution (1787); the Democratic Party has a good claim to being the world's oldest political party.\"</ref>\n\nThe Democratic Party at its founding supported a different set of issues than it presently supports.  From its founding until the mid-20th century, the Democratic Party was the dominant party among white southerners , and as such, was then the party most associated with the defense of slavery. However, following the [[Great Society]] under [[Lyndon B. Johnson]], the Democratic Party became the more progressive party on issues of civil rights, while losing dominance in the Southern states to the Republicans.\n\nThe Democratic Party since 1912 has positioned itself as the liberal party on domestic issues. The economic philosophy of [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]], which has strongly influenced [[Modern liberalism in the United States|modern American liberalism]], has shaped much of the party's agenda since 1932. Roosevelt's [[New Deal coalition]] controlled the White House until 1968, with the exception of the two terms of [[Dwight D. Eisenhower|President Eisenhower]] from 1953\u20131961. Since the mid-20th century, Democrats have generally been in the [[center-left]] and currently support [[social justice]], [[social liberalism]], a [[mixed economy]], and the [[welfare state]], although [[Bill Clinton]] and other [[New Democrats]] have pushed for [[free trade]] and [[neoliberalism]], which is seen to have shifted the party rightwards. Democrats are currently strongest in the [[Northeast of the United States|Northeast]] and [[West Coast of the United States|West Coast]] and in major American urban centers.  African-Americans and Latinos tend to be disproportionately Democratic, as do [[trade union]]s.\n\nIn 2004, it was the largest political party, with 72 million registered voters (42.6% of 169 million registered) claiming affiliation.<ref name=\"Neuhart20040122\">{{cite news\n|url=https://www.usatoday.com/news/opinion/columnist/neuharth/2004-01-22-neuharth_x.htm\n|last=Neuhart|first=Al|title=Why politics is fun from catbirds' seats|work=USA Today|accessdate=2007-07-11 | date=January 22, 2004}}</ref> Although his party lost the election for president in 2004, [[Barack Obama]] would later go on to become president in 2009 and continue to be the president until January 2017.  Obama was the 15th Democrat to hold the office, and from the [[United States general elections, 2006|2006 midterm elections]] until the [[United States elections, 2014|2014 midterm elections]], the Democratic Party was also the [[Two-party system|majority party]] in the [[United States Senate]].\n\nA 2011 ''[[USA Today]]'' review of state voter rolls indicates that the number of registered Democrats declined in 25 of 28 states (some states do not register voters by party). During this time, Republican registration also declined, as independent or no preference voting was on the rise.  But in 2011 Democrats numbers shrank 800,000, and from 2008 they were down by 1.7 million, or 3.9%.<ref name=\"Wolf\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.usatoday.com/news/politics/story/2011-12-22/voters-political-parties/52171688/1|title=Voters leaving Republican, Democratic parties in droves|author=Wolf, Richard|first=|date=December 22, 2011|work=USA Today|archive-url=|archive-date=|accessdate=June 20, 2012}}</ref>\n\n=== Republican Party ===\n{{Main|Republican Party (United States)|History of the United States Republican Party}}\nThe Republican Party is one of the two major contemporary political parties in the United States of America. Since the 1880s it has been nicknamed (by the media) the \"Grand Old Party\"  or GOP, although it is younger than the Democratic Party.\n\nFounded in 1854 by Northern anti-slavery activists and modernizers, the Republican Party rose to prominence in 1860 with the election of [[Abraham Lincoln]], who used the party machinery to support victory in the [[American Civil War]]. The GOP dominated national politics during the [[Third Party System]], from 1854 to 1896, and the [[Fourth Party System]] from 1896 to 1932.\n\nSince its founding, the Republican Party has been the more market-oriented of the two American political parties, often favoring policies that aid American business interests.  As a party whose power was once based on the voting power of Union Army veterans, this party has traditionally supported more aggressive defense measures and more lavish veterans' benefits. Today, the Republican Party supports an [[Conservatism in the United States|American conservative]] platform, with further foundations in [[economic liberalism]], [[fiscal conservatism]], and [[social conservatism]].  The Republican Party tends to be strongest in the [[Southern United States]] and the \"[[flyover states]]\", as well as suburban and rural areas in other states.  One significant base of support for the Republican Party is [[Evangelical Christian]]s, who have wielded significant power in the party since the early 1970s.\n\n[[President of the United States|President]] [[Donald Trump]] is the 18th and the current Republican to be elected to the office of [[President of the United States]]. Since the [[United States elections, 2010|2010 midterm elections]], the Republicans held a majority in the United States House of Representatives until the 2018 midterms where they lost it to the Democratic Party.  Additionally, since the 2014 elections, the Republican Party has controlled the Senate.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2016-election/president|title=2016 Election News, Candidates & Polls|publisher=}}</ref>\n\n== Minor parties ==\nThe United States also has an array of minor parties, the largest of which (on the basis of support for their Presidential candidates in the 2016 election), are the Libertarian, Green, and Constitution parties.\n{{Main|List of political parties in the United States}}\n\n=== Libertarian Party ===\n{{Main|Libertarian Party (United States)}}\nThe Libertarian Party was founded on December 11, 1971.<ref>[http://www.lp.org/organization/history.shtml Libertarian Party:Our History] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060130133301/http://www.lp.org/organization/history.shtml |date=2006-01-30 }}, LP.org</ref> It is the largest continuing [[third party (United States)|third party]] in the United States, claiming well over 500,000 registered voters across all 50 states.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ballot-access.org/2017/07/27/new-registration-data-for-the-united-states/|title=New Voter Registration Nation Totals|first=Richard|last=Winger|date=27 July 2017|work=ballot-access.org|accessdate=27 July 2017}}</ref> As of 2019, they have about 176 elected officials, including 1 state legislator.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.lp.org/elected-officials/|title=Elected Officials|publisher=}}</ref>\n\nThe 2012 Libertarian Party nominee for United States President was former New Mexico governor, [[Gary Johnson]].

In [[2016 United States presidential election|2016]], Johnson ran again, receiving over four million votes, or 3.3% of the popular vote.\n\nThe Libertarian Party's core mission is to reduce the size, influence, and expenditures of all levels of government. To this effect, the party supports minimally regulated markets, a less powerful [[federal government]], strong [[civil liberties]], [[drug liberalization]], [[separation of church and state]], [[open immigration]], [[non-interventionism]] and [[neutrality (international relations)|neutrality]] in diplomatic relations, [[free trade]] and [[freedom of movement|free movement]] to all foreign countries, and a more representative republic.<ref name=LPOption>{{cite web|title=The Libertarian Option|url=http://www.lp.org/introduction/the-libertarian-option|website=The Libertarian Party|publisher=Libertarian National Committee, Inc.|accessdate=5 July 2014}}</ref> As of 2016, it is the third largest organized political party in the United States.\n\n=== Green Party ===\n{{Main|Green Party of the United States}}\nIn the [[United States]], the Green Party has been active as a [[third party (United States)|third party]] since the 1980s. The party first gained widespread public attention during [[Ralph Nader]]'s second presidential run in [[U.S. presidential election, 2000|2000]].

As of 2016, it is the fourth largest organized political party in the United States.\n\n=== Constitution Party ===\n{{Main|Constitution Party (United States)}}\n{{refimprove-section|date=February 2020}}\nThe Constitution Party is a small national conservative political party in the United States. It was founded as the U.S. Taxpayers Party in 1992 by Howard Phillips. The party's official name was changed to the \"Constitution Party\" in 1999; however, some state affiliate parties are known under different names.\n\nThe Constitution Party is strongly pro-life (i.e. opposed to [[abortion]]), and supports [[Gun politics in the United States|gun rights]], and restrictions on immigration. It calls for protectionist trade policies.\n\nIn 2006, [[Rick Jore]] of [[Montana]] became the first Constitution Party candidate elected to a state-level office,<ref>[http://sos.mt.gov/ELB/archives/2006/elections/general/house/hd12/index.asp \"State Legislature results\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061116040533/http://sos.mt.gov/ELB/archives/2006/elections/general/house/hd12/index.asp |date=2006-11-16 }}, ''Missoulian'', November 8, 2006, retrieved November 8, 2006</ref><ref>[http://www.helenair.com/articles/2006/11/09/montana/a01110906_02.txt Control of state Legislature unclear], ''Helena Independent Record''</ref> though the Constitution Party of Montana had disaffiliated itself from the national party a short time before the election.\n\nIn 2010 former Congressman [[Tom Tancredo]] was the Constitution Party candidate for governor of [[Colorado]], coming in second with 617,030 votes, 36.4% and ahead of the Republican candidate, Dan Maes, with 11.1%.\n\nThe Constitution Party's 2012 presidential nominee was former Congressman [[Virgil Goode]] of Virginia.\n\nTennessee Attorney [[Darrell Castle]] was the 2016 Constitution Party nominee for President of the United States and Scott Bradley of Utah was the nominee for Vice President.\n\n== Issues ==\n{{See also|Left\u2013right politics#Contemporary usage in the United States|label 1=Usage of \"left\u2013right\" politics in the United States|Politics of the United States#Organization of American political parties|label 2=Organization of American political parties}}\n\nBecause American political parties are more loosely organized than those in other countries, not all members of a party subscribe to all of the officially held positions in their respective [[party platform|party's platform]]. The usual degree of variation generally is higher for the larger parties. Party members may hold different views on legislation to be enacted at the state or federal levels, and an elected official once in office may act contradictory to many of his or her party's positions (this has led to terms such as \"[[Republican In Name Only]]\" and \"[[Democrat In Name Only]]\" \u2013 RINO and DINO, respectively). Furthermore, the modern American [[political spectrum]], and the usage of [[left\u2013right politics]], differs from the rest of the world. For example, the Democratic Party, the primary left-of-center party in the country, generally supports a [[social liberal]] position rather than a [[social democratic]] one, though there are exceptions.\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n== Further reading ==\n* Critchlow, Donald T.
