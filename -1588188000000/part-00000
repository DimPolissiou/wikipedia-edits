Doug was introduced by executive producer [[Don Battye]] as the patriarch of the newly introduced Willis family. Donovan explained that being part of \"a loving family\" was one of the main reasons he accepted the role. He said he was happy to stay around for as long as the producers wanted him. Donovan made his first screen appearance as Doug during the episode broadcast on 18 July 1990.\n\nDoug was portrayed as a [[man's man]], down-to-earth, easy-going and friendly. Doug was a builder, who loved his family and enjoyed spending time with his friends. Despite being \"an easy touch\" as a father, Doug could balance understanding with discipline. Doug and his wife, [[Pam Willis|Pam]] ([[Sue Jones (actress)|Sue Jones]]) had a solid marriage until they began to neglect each other due to work. When Doug thought Pam was having an affair with their neighbour [[Jim Robinson (Neighbours)|Jim Robinson]] ([[Alan Dale]]), he ended up having a [[one-night stand]] with Jill Weir (Lyn Semler). Doug's father, [[Bert Willis|Bert]] ([[Bud Tingwell]]), was introduced in 1993. They had had a difficult relationship but Doug made amends with his father when he learned he was dying. Shortly after, Doug got into debt and lost his job, causing him to sink into a deep depression.\n\nOne of Doug's last storylines saw him suffer a health scare in which he had to undergo an emergency operation. The character departed on 15 September 1994, after being written out. In July 2005, Donovan reprised his role as part of the show's 20th anniversary celebrations. He reprised the role again in April 2014 and Doug came to Ramsay Street to visit his family. He was also diagnosed with [[Alzheimer's disease]]. Doug continued to make guest appearances until his death in April 2016, with his storylines mostly focusing on the progression of his Alzheimer's and how it affects him and his family.\n\n==Casting==\nFollowing a short stint in rival Australian soap opera ''[[Home and Away]]'', Donovan joined the cast of ''Neighbours'' in 1990.<ref name=\"Pritchard\">{{cite journal|last=Pritchard|first=Chris|date=February 1992|title=Jason couldn't have made it without me|journal=[[Woman's Own]]|publisher=[[IPC Media]]|pages=10\u201311}}</ref> He was cast in the role of Doug, the patriarch of the newly introduced Willis family.<ref name=\"Pritchard\"/> The family aspect was one of the main reasons Donovan accepted the part.

During a friend's [[bucks night]], Doug accepted a dare to travel across town in a taxi naked. The taxi driver turned out to be Pam Beresford, who Doug fell in love with. He and Pam married and had five children, four of whom survived. When Doug does some work on Number 28 Ramsay Street in preparation for a sale, he decides to purchase the house and the family move to Erinsborough. Doug becomes good friends with [[Joe Mangel]] ([[Mark Little (Australian actor)|Mark Little]]), [[Lou Carpenter]] ([[Tom Oliver]]) and Jim Robinson, even though they get off to a bad start when Doug flirts with Jim's wife. When Doug's eldest son, Adam, quits medicine, Doug believes he can pass his construction business onto him. However, when he realises that Adam is not really into it, Doug makes his time on the site difficult, forcing Adam to go back to his studies. Doug goes into partnership with [[Paul Robinson (Neighbours)|Paul Robinson]] ([[Stefan Dennis]]) and they plan to build a retirement village in the bush. Councillor [[Felicity Brent]] (Rhona McLeod) threatens to vote against the development but fails and work begins. The project eventually collapses, leaving Doug and Paul in debt.\n\nDoug and Pam's financial troubles continue due to Cody's student exchange fees and them having to bail Brad out of jail. Just as they being thinking about selling the house, Gaby tricks one of Doug's debtors into paying up. Doug befriends [[Brenda Riley]] ([[Genevieve Lemon]]) and she falls in love with him. Brenda kisses Doug, which Gaby witnesses and she tells Pam. Doug explains that he is not having an affair and then tells Brenda that he never felt anything other than friendship towards her. Doug's sister, Faye, comes to stay and Doug puts up with her because she is lonely. When Faye invites Doug's childhood sweetheart, Alexandra Lomax ([[Chantal Contouri]]), for a visit, Doug asks her to leave. Faye moves into Number 32 instead. Doug's photo appears in the local newspaper and it is spotted by Jill Weir. She befriends Doug and Pam, who support her in her custody battle for her son, Ross. When Ross dies, she relies on Doug and Pam. Doug realises that Jill is attracted to him but Pam fails to notice. When Doug assumes Pam and Jim are having an affair, he has a one-night stand with Jill. Doug immediately regrets it and tells Pam, who throws him out and files for divorce. However, when Doug and Brad are lost at sea, Pam realises how much she loves him and they reconcile.\n\nWhen Gaby is almost raped by [[Simon Hunter]] (Frederick Whitlock), Doug tracks him down and hits him. Simon threatens to sue Doug for assault if Gaby reports him to the police, so she is forced to drop the matter. Doug's father, Bert, turns up after Gaby reveals that she has been writing to him. Bert tries to make amends with his son but Doug refuses to forgive him. When Doug learns Bert is dying, he decides to make peace with him. Doug is given the contract to rebuild the Waterhole but before work can begin his company is audited and discovered to be in debt to the tax department, leaving Doug no choice but to sell it to Constructocon. The company keep Doug on but he is eventually fired. Doug sinks into a deep depression and begins drinking. Things begin to improve when Doug finds a job as a sales representative for a building supplier. Doug and Pam learn that they actually paid the money they were supposed to have owed to the tax department and receive a refund. Doug uses the money to buy a house to do up and he sells it to the council, who ask him to do further renovations to the property. Doug finds himself in trouble with [[Andrew MacKenzie (Neighbours)|Andrew \"Macca\" MacKenzie]] (John Morris) when he and Lou begin brewing their own beer in the shed at the property but Macca eventually joins them.\n\nGaby gives birth to a son, [[Zac Willis|Zac]] (Jay Callahan), who is named after Doug's grandfather and she leaves to run a hotel in Darwin. A few weeks later, she contacts Doug and offers him some building work on the hotel. Doug and Pam decide to sell up and they leave Erinsborough. Cody stays behind to continue her studies. A year later, Cody is shot and Pam returns to be with her, while Doug stays behind as he is the middle of a big building contract. When Cody comes round, Doug speaks with her on the phone. However, Cody takes a turn for the worse and dies. Pam takes her body back to Darwin where she and Doug bury her. In July 2005, [[Annalise Hartman]] ([[Kimberley Davies]]) invites Doug to attend a screening of her documentary about Ramsay Street. Doug returns with [[Philip Martin (Neighbours)|Philip Martin]] ([[Ian Rawlings]]) and they sneak into Number 22 and paint a beard onto a sleeping Lou's face. After watching the documentary, Lou joins Doug and Philip on a fishing trip up north.\n\nIn April 2014, Doug comes to visit Brad and his family on Ramsay Street. Doug also wants to teach his grandson, Josh, the basics of the building trade. Doug catches up with Lou and they decide to start making some of their home brew. [[Sheila Canning]] ([[Colette Mann]]) hires Doug to cover for her grandson at his yard, and he accepts. Brad's wife, [[Terese Willis|Terese]] ([[Rebekah Elmaloglou]]), suspects Doug prefers Beth to her but Doug assures Brad that it is not the case. Terese later notices that Doug appears to be forgetting things but Brad puts it down to old age. Josh also becomes concerned when Doug messes up a couple of jobs, leaves the yard unattended and gives [[Imogen Willis|Imogen]] (Ariel Kaplan) alcoholic ginger beer by mistake. When Doug stays out all night, he is found injured and talking about meeting Cody. Josh accompanies Doug to the hospital and tests show Doug has early onset Alzheimer's disease. Pam comes down to see Doug and does not initially believe the diagnosis of Alzheimer's, thinking that Doug has been having an affair. She is convinced of Doug's illness and vows to stand by her husband. Brad and Terese asks Pam and Doug to move in with them but Pam and Doug reject the offer to go travelling.\n\nDoug returns a few months later to support Josh ahead of his court case for punching [[Chris Pappas (Neighbours)|Chris Pappas]] (James Mason). Josh takes Doug to the park to play cricket, so he has positive memories of him in case he is sent to jail. Doug meets his granddaughter [[Paige Smith|Paige]] ([[Olympia Valance]]) for the first time. He mentions that Brad and Lauren might have stayed together if they had known that Paige was alive but realises he has made a mistake and apologises for upsetting Terese. Doug later gifts Paige an ankle bracelet to welcome her to the family. Doug briefly goes missing and is found in Number 28, his old home. He later teaches Josh and Paige some woodwork skills. When Doug learns Imogen is not attending her school formal, he organises a family formal for her instead. He tells her she can call him anytime, before he leaves for Darwin the next day. The following year, Doug returns to meet Josh's newborn daughter Matilda and stay with his family for Christmas. He gives Paige a commitment ring to give to her boyfriend [[Mark Brennan (Neighbours)|Mark Brennan]] ([[Scott McGregor (model)|Scott McGregor]]). Doug runs Paul's car off the road, causing him and his passenger [[Stephanie Scully]] ([[Carla Bonner]]) to crash. Josh realises what Doug did and tries to protect him. Steph agrees not to report Doug to the police if he agrees to stop driving. Doug and Lou team up to get Josh and [[Amber Turner]] (Jenna Rosenow) talking about their daughter's future. Doug announces that he is going home and laments that it might be the last time he remembers who everyone is. He pays a visit to Lou, before leaving for Darwin. After Doug accidentally sets fire to his house, Pam decides she can no longer take care of him. Brad and Lauren offer to let Doug move in with them but Doug disapproves of Brad and Lauren's relationship and is rude to Lauren. He goes to see Terese and she calms him down, before encouraging him to accept Brad and Lauren's relationship, and he apologises to them. Paul convinces Doug to invest in his plan to renovate a run-down motel. Doug goes for a drive with Susan during a heatwave. The car breaks down because Doug put water in the oil. Doug walks away and Susan collapses with heatstroke. Imogen later finds Susan, who is taken to hospital. Doug's condition continues to deteriorate and his family consider putting him in a nursing home but decide to hire [[Nene Williams]] ([[Ally Fowler]]) to care for him. However, she manipulates his condition to gain attention from Karl Kennedy and is fired. Nene apologises to Doug. Following an explosion at Lassiter's Hotel, Doug goes missing. His grandson, Ned, finds him in his hotel room and it emerges Doug brought Ned to Erinsborough to see Brad. Shortly after they are reunited, Doug collapses. Karl is unable to revive him and he pronounces him dead.\n\n==Reception==\nA writer for the BBC's official ''Neighbours'' website stated that Doug's most notable moment was \"Having an affair with Jill Weir.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/neighbours/whoswho/characterbiogs/index.shtml?content/_dougwillis/page1|title=Character: Doug Willis|publisher=[[BBC]]|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20031007040204/http://www.bbc.co.uk/neighbours/whoswho/characterbiogs/index.shtml?content%2F_dougwillis%2Fpage1|archivedate=7 October 2003|accessdate=15 August 2013|url-status=dead|df=}}</ref> Haywood commented that Doug was \"the more likeable part\" compared to Donovan's character, [[Al Simpson (Home and Away)|Al Simpson]], in ''Home and Away''.<ref>[[#refhaywood|Haywood 1991]], p.163.</ref> Monroe branded Doug \"warm-hearted and friendly\" and thought that he and Paul made \"an odd couple in business\".<ref>[[#refmonroe2|Monroe 1994]], p.113.</ref> Wanda Jamrozick, writing for ''[[The Sydney Morning Herald]]'', called Donovan's performance as Doug \"a dominating presence\".<ref>{{cite news|url=http://newsstore.fairfax.com.au/apps/viewDocument.ac?page=1&sy=nstore&kw=Terry+Donovan+and+doug&pb=all_ffx&dt=selectRange&dr=entire&so=relevance&sf=text&sf=headline&rc=10&rm=200&sp=nrm&clsPage=1&docID=news920225_0103_9435|title=Today's people|last=Jamrozick|first=Wanda|date=25 February 1992|work=[[The Sydney Morning Herald]]|publisher=[[Fairfax Media]]|accessdate=15 August 2013}}</ref>\n\nDuring her feature on ''Neighbours'', Anna Pickard from ''[[The Guardian]]'' tried to choose the characters she would be most starstruck by if she met them.

Doug was introduced by executive producer [[Don Battye]] as the patriarch of the newly introduced Willis family. Donovan explained that being part of \"a loving family\" was one of the main reasons he accepted the role. He said he was happy to stay around for as long as the producers wanted him. Donovan made his first screen appearance as Doug during the episode broadcast on 18 July 1990.\n\nDoug was portrayed as a [[man's man]], down-to-earth, easy-going and friendly. Doug was a builder, who loved his family and enjoyed spending time with his friends. Despite being \"an easy touch\" as a father, Doug could balance understanding with discipline. Doug and his wife, [[Pam Willis|Pam]] ([[Sue Jones (actress)|Sue Jones]]) had a solid marriage until they began to neglect each other due to work. When Doug thought Pam was having an affair with their neighbour [[Jim Robinson (Neighbours)|Jim Robinson]] ([[Alan Dale]]), he ended up having a [[one-night stand]] with Jill Weir (Lyn Semler). Doug's father, [[Bert Willis|Bert]] ([[Bud Tingwell]]), was introduced in 1993. They had had a difficult relationship but Doug made amends with his father when he learned he was dying. Shortly after, Doug got into debt and lost his job, causing him to sink into a deep depression.\n\nOne of Doug's last storylines saw him suffer a health scare in which he had to undergo an emergency operation. The character departed on 15 September 1994, after being written out. In July 2005, Donovan reprised his role as part of the show's 20th anniversary celebrations. He reprised the role again in April 2014 and Doug came to Ramsay Street to visit his family. He was also diagnosed with [[Alzheimer's disease]]. Doug continued to make guest appearances until his death in April 2016, with his storylines mostly focusing on the progression of his Alzheimer's and how it affects him and his family.\n\n==Casting==\nFollowing a short stint in rival Australian soap opera ''[[Home and Away]]'', Donovan joined the cast of ''Neighbours'' in 1990.<ref name=\"Pritchard\">{{cite journal|last=Pritchard|first=Chris|date=February 1992|title=Jason couldn't have made it without me|journal=[[Woman's Own]]|publisher=[[IPC Media]]|pages=10\u201311}}</ref> He was cast in the role of Doug, the patriarch of the newly introduced Willis family.<ref name=\"Pritchard\"/> The family aspect was one of the main reasons Donovan accepted the part.

During a friend's [[bucks night]], Doug accepted a dare to travel across town in a taxi naked. The taxi driver turned out to be Pam Beresford, who Doug fell in love with. He and Pam married and had five children, four of whom survived. When Doug does some work on Number 28 Ramsay Street in preparation for a sale, he decides to purchase the house and the family move to Erinsborough. Doug becomes good friends with [[Joe Mangel]] ([[Mark Little (Australian actor)|Mark Little]]), [[Lou Carpenter]] ([[Tom Oliver]]) and Jim Robinson, even though they get off to a bad start when Doug flirts with Jim's wife. When Doug's eldest son, Adam, quits medicine, Doug believes he can pass his construction business onto him. However, when he realises that Adam is not really into it, Doug makes his time on the site difficult, forcing Adam to go back to his studies. Doug goes into partnership with [[Paul Robinson (Neighbours)|Paul Robinson]] ([[Stefan Dennis]]) and they plan to build a retirement village in the bush. Councillor [[Felicity Brent]] (Rhona McLeod) threatens to vote against the development but fails and work begins. The project eventually collapses, leaving Doug and Paul in debt.\n\nDoug and Pam's financial troubles continue due to Cody's student exchange fees and them having to bail Brad out of jail. Just as they being thinking about selling the house, Gaby tricks one of Doug's debtors into paying up. Doug befriends [[Brenda Riley]] ([[Genevieve Lemon]]) and she falls in love with him. Brenda kisses Doug, which Gaby witnesses and she tells Pam. Doug explains that he is not having an affair and then tells Brenda that he never felt anything other than friendship towards her. Doug's sister, Faye, comes to stay and Doug puts up with her because she is lonely. When Faye invites Doug's childhood sweetheart, Alexandra Lomax ([[Chantal Contouri]]), for a visit, Doug asks her to leave. Faye moves into Number 32 instead. Doug's photo appears in the local newspaper and it is spotted by Jill Weir. She befriends Doug and Pam, who support her in her custody battle for her son, Ross. When Ross dies, she relies on Doug and Pam. Doug realises that Jill is attracted to him but Pam fails to notice. When Doug assumes Pam and Jim are having an affair, he has a one-night stand with Jill. Doug immediately regrets it and tells Pam, who throws him out and files for divorce. However, when Doug and Brad are lost at sea, Pam realises how much she loves him and they reconcile.\n\nWhen Gaby is almost raped by [[Simon Hunter]] (Frederick Whitlock), Doug tracks him down and hits him. Simon threatens to sue Doug for assault if Gaby reports him to the police, so she is forced to drop the matter. Doug's father, Bert, turns up after Gaby reveals that she has been writing to him. Bert tries to make amends with his son but Doug refuses to forgive him. When Doug learns Bert is dying, he decides to make peace with him. Doug is given the contract to rebuild the Waterhole but before work can begin his company is audited and discovered to be in debt to the tax department, leaving Doug no choice but to sell it to Constructocon. The company keep Doug on but he is eventually fired. Doug sinks into a deep depression and begins drinking. Things begin to improve when Doug finds a job as a sales representative for a building supplier. Doug and Pam learn that they actually paid the money they were supposed to have owed to the tax department and receive a refund. Doug uses the money to buy a house to do up and he sells it to the council, who ask him to do further renovations to the property. Doug finds himself in trouble with [[Andrew MacKenzie (Neighbours)|Andrew \"Macca\" MacKenzie]] (John Morris) when he and Lou begin brewing their own beer in the shed at the property but Macca eventually joins them.\n\nGaby gives birth to a son, [[Zac Willis|Zac]] (Jay Callahan), who is named after Doug's grandfather and she leaves to run a hotel in Darwin. A few weeks later, she contacts Doug and offers him some building work on the hotel. Doug and Pam decide to sell up and they leave Erinsborough. Cody stays behind to continue her studies. A year later, Cody is shot and Pam returns to be with her, while Doug stays behind as he is the middle of a big building contract. When Cody comes round, Doug speaks with her on the phone. However, Cody takes a turn for the worse and dies. Pam takes her body back to Darwin where she and Doug bury her. In July 2005, [[Annalise Hartman]] ([[Kimberley Davies]]) invites Doug to attend a screening of her documentary about Ramsay Street. Doug returns with [[Philip Martin (Neighbours)|Philip Martin]] ([[Ian Rawlings]]) and they sneak into Number 22 and paint a beard onto a sleeping Lou's face. After watching the documentary, Lou joins Doug and Philip on a fishing trip up north.\n\nIn April 2014, Doug comes to visit Brad and his family on Ramsay Street. Doug also wants to teach his grandson, Josh, the basics of the building trade. Doug catches up with Lou and they decide to start making some of their home brew. [[Sheila Canning]] ([[Colette Mann]]) hires Doug to cover for her grandson at his yard, and he accepts. Brad's wife, [[Terese Willis|Terese]] ([[Rebekah Elmaloglou]]), suspects Doug prefers Beth to her but Doug assures Brad that it is not the case. Terese later notices that Doug appears to be forgetting things but Brad puts it down to old age. Josh also becomes concerned when Doug messes up a couple of jobs, leaves the yard unattended and gives [[Imogen Willis|Imogen]] (Ariel Kaplan) alcoholic ginger beer by mistake. When Doug stays out all night, he is found injured and talking about meeting Cody. Josh accompanies Doug to the hospital and tests show Doug has early onset Alzheimer's disease. Pam comes down to see Doug and does not initially believe the diagnosis of Alzheimer's, thinking that Doug has been having an affair. She is convinced of Doug's illness and vows to stand by her husband. Brad and Terese asks Pam and Doug to move in with them but Pam and Doug reject the offer to go travelling.\n\nDoug returns a few months later to support Josh ahead of his court case for punching [[Chris Pappas (Neighbours)|Chris Pappas]] (James Mason). Josh takes Doug to the park to play cricket, so he has positive memories of him in case he is sent to jail. Doug meets his granddaughter [[Paige Smith|Paige]] ([[Olympia Valance]]) for the first time. He mentions that Brad and Lauren might have stayed together if they had known that Paige was alive but realises he has made a mistake and apologises for upsetting Terese. Doug later gifts Paige an ankle bracelet to welcome her to the family. Doug briefly goes missing and is found in Number 28, his old home. He later teaches Josh and Paige some woodwork skills. When Doug learns Imogen is not attending her school formal, he organises a family formal for her instead. He tells her she can call him anytime, before he leaves for Darwin the next day. The following year, Doug returns to meet Josh's newborn daughter Matilda and stay with his family for Christmas. He gives Paige a commitment ring to give to her boyfriend [[Mark Brennan (Neighbours)|Mark Brennan]] ([[Scott McGregor (model)|Scott McGregor]]). Doug runs Paul's car off the road, causing him and his passenger [[Stephanie Scully]] ([[Carla Bonner]]) to crash. Josh realises what Doug did and tries to protect him. Steph agrees not to report Doug to the police if he agrees to stop driving. Doug and Lou team up to get Josh and [[Amber Turner]] (Jenna Rosenow) talking about their daughter's future. Doug announces that he is going home and laments that it might be the last time he remembers who everyone is. He pays a visit to Lou, before leaving for Darwin. After Doug accidentally sets fire to his house, Pam decides she can no longer take care of him. Brad and Lauren offer to let Doug move in with them but Doug disapproves of Brad and Lauren's relationship and is rude to Lauren. He goes to see Terese and she calms him down, before encouraging him to accept Brad and Lauren's relationship, and he apologises to them. Paul convinces Doug to invest in his plan to renovate a run-down motel. Doug goes for a drive with Susan during a heatwave. The car breaks down because Doug put water in the oil. Doug walks away and Susan collapses with heatstroke. Imogen later finds Susan, who is taken to hospital. Doug's condition continues to deteriorate and his family consider putting him in a nursing home but decide to hire [[Nene Williams]] ([[Ally Fowler]]) to care for him. However, she manipulates his condition to gain attention from Karl Kennedy and is fired. Nene apologises to Doug. Following an explosion at Lassiter's Hotel, Doug goes missing. His grandson, Ned, finds him in his hotel room and it emerges Doug brought Ned to Erinsborough to see Brad. Shortly after they are reunited, Doug collapses. Karl is unable to revive him and he pronounces him dead.\n\n==Reception==\nA writer for the BBC's official ''Neighbours'' website stated that Doug's most notable moment was \"Having an affair with Jill Weir.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/neighbours/whoswho/characterbiogs/index.shtml?content/_dougwillis/page1|title=Character: Doug Willis|publisher=[[BBC]]|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20031007040204/http://www.bbc.co.uk/neighbours/whoswho/characterbiogs/index.shtml?content%2F_dougwillis%2Fpage1|archivedate=7 October 2003|accessdate=15 August 2013|url-status=dead|df=}}</ref> Haywood commented that Doug was \"the more likeable part\" compared to Donovan's character, [[Al Simpson (Home and Away)|Al Simpson]], in ''Home and Away''.<ref>[[#refhaywood|Haywood 1991]], p.163.</ref> Monroe branded Doug \"warm-hearted and friendly\" and thought that he and Paul made \"an odd couple in business\".<ref>[[#refmonroe2|Monroe 1994]], p.113.</ref> Wanda Jamrozick, writing for ''[[The Sydney Morning Herald]]'', called Donovan's performance as Doug \"a dominating presence\".<ref>{{cite news|url=http://newsstore.fairfax.com.au/apps/viewDocument.ac?page=1&sy=nstore&kw=Terry+Donovan+and+doug&pb=all_ffx&dt=selectRange&dr=entire&so=relevance&sf=text&sf=headline&rc=10&rm=200&sp=nrm&clsPage=1&docID=news920225_0103_9435|title=Today's people|last=Jamrozick|first=Wanda|date=25 February 1992|work=[[The Sydney Morning Herald]]|publisher=[[Fairfax Media]]|accessdate=15 August 2013}}</ref>\n\nDuring her feature on ''Neighbours'', Anna Pickard from ''[[The Guardian]]'' tried to choose the characters she would be most starstruck by if she met them.

This represents a unique anomaly in the [[Americas]], where [[language shift]] towards European colonial languages (in this case, the other [[official language]] of [[Spanish language|Spanish]]) has otherwise been a nearly universal cultural and identity marker of [[mestizo]]s (people of mixed [[Spanish people|Spanish]] and [[Amerindian]] ancestry).\n\n[[Jesuit]] priest [[Antonio Ruiz de Montoya]], who in 1639 published the first written grammar of Guarani in a book called ''[[Tesoro de la lengua guaran\u00ed]]'' (Treasure of the Guarani Language / <!-- The Spanish word \"tesoro\" means both \"treasure\" and \"thesaurus\", and makes this title a double entendre. The English word \"treasure\" is cognate with \"thesaurus\" and is also cognate with the Spanish word \"tesoro\". All words descend from the Ancient Greek word \"th\u0113saur\u00f3s\". --> The Guarani Language [[Thesaurus]]), described it as a language \"so copious and elegant that it can compete with the most famous [of languages]\".\n\nThe name \"Guarani\" is generally used for the official language of Paraguay. However, this is part of a [[dialect chain]], most of whose [[Guarani dialects|components]] are also often called Guarani.\n\n== History ==\nThe persistence of Guarani is, contrary to popular belief, not exclusively, or even primarily, due to the influence of the Jesuits in Paraguay.{{citation needed|date=September 2017}} While Guarani was the only language spoken in the expansive missionary territories, Paraguayan Guarani has its roots outside of the [[Jesuit Reductions|Jesuit reductions]].\n\nModern scholarship has shown that Guarani was always the primary language of colonial Paraguay, both inside and outside the reductions. Following the [[Suppression of the Society of Jesus|expulsion of the Jesuits]] in the 18th century, the residents of the reductions gradually migrated north and west towards [[Asunci\u00f3n]], a demographic shift that brought about a decidedly one-sided shift away from the Jesuit dialect that the missionaries had curated in the southern and eastern territories of the colony.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Wilde|first1=Guillermo|title=Los guaran\u00edes despu\u00e9s de la expulsi\u00f3n de los jesuitas: din\u00e1micas pol\u00edticas y transacciones simb\u00f3licas.|journal=[[Revista Complutense de Historia de Am\u00e9rica]]|date=2001|volume=27 |pages=69-106|language=Spanish}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last1=Telesca|first1=Ignacio|title=Tras los expulsos: cambios demogr\u00e1ficos y territoriales en el paraguay despu\u00e9s de la expulsi\u00f3n de los jesuitas|date=2009|publisher=Universidad Cat\u00f3lica \"Nuestra Se\u00f1ora De La Asunci\u00f3n\"|location=Asunci\u00f3n}}</ref>\n\nBy and large, the Guarani of the Jesuits shied away from direct phonological loans from Spanish. Instead, the missionaries relied on the agglutinative nature of the language to formulate [[calque]] terms from native morphemes. This process often led the Jesuits to employ complicated, highly synthetic terms to convey Western concepts.<ref>{{cite book|author1=Harald Thun|authorlink1=La hispanizaci\u00f3n del guaran\u00ed jesu\u00edtico en 'lo espiritual' y en 'lo temporal'.

Its modern alphabet is basically a subset of the [[Latin script]] (with \"J\", \"K\" and \"Y\" but not \"W\"), complemented with two diacritics and six [[digraph (orthography)|digraphs]]. Its [[orthography]] is largely phonemic, with letter values mostly similar to those of [[Spanish language|Spanish]]. The [[tilde]] is used with many letters that are considered part of the alphabet. In the case of \u00d1/\u00f1, it differentiates the palatal nasal from the alveolar nasal (as in Spanish), whereas it marks stressed [[nasalization|nasalisation]] when used over a vowel (as in [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]]): \u00e3, \u1ebd, \u0129, \u00f5, \u0169, \u1ef9. (Nasal vowels have been written with several other diacritics: \u00e4, \u0101, \u00e2, \u00e3.) The tilde also marks nasality in the case of G\u0303/g\u0303, used to represent the [[nasalized velar approximant]] by combining the [[velar approximant]] \"G\" with the [[Nasalisation|nasalising]] [[tilde]]. The letter G\u0303/g\u0303, which is unique to this language, was introduced into the orthography relatively recently during the mid-20th century and there is disagreement over its use. It is not a [[precomposed character]] in [[Unicode]], which can cause typographic inconveniences \u2013 such as needing to press \"delete\" twice \u2013 or imperfect rendering when using computers and fonts that do not properly support the complex layout feature of glyph composition.\n\nOnly stressed nasal vowels are written as nasal. If an oral vowel is stressed, and it is not the final syllable, it is marked with an acute accent: \u00e1, \u00e9, \u00ed, \u00f3, \u00fa, \u00fd. That is, stress falls on the vowel marked as nasalized, if any, else on the accent-marked syllable, and if neither appears, then on the final syllable.\n\nFor [[blind people]] there is also a [[Guarani Braille]].\n\n== Phonology ==\nGuarani syllables consist of a consonant plus a vowel or a vowel alone; syllables ending in a consonant or two or more consonants together do not occur. This is represented as ''(C)V(V)''.\n\n* [[Vowels]]: {{IPA|/a/, /e/, /i/, /o/, /u/}} correspond more or less to the Spanish and IPA equivalents, although sometimes the [[allophones]] {{IPA|[\u025b]}}, {{IPA|[\u0254]}} are used more frequently; the grapheme {{angbr|y}} represents the vowel {{IPAslink|\u0268}} (as in [[Latgalian language|Latgalian]]).\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center;\"\n|+ Oral and nasal vowels\n! !!

The oral allophones of the voiced stops are [[prenasalized]].\n\nThere is also a sequence {{IPA|/\u207ft/}} (written {{angbr|nt}}). A trill {{IPA|/r/}} (written {{angbr|rr}}), and the consonants {{IPA|/l/}}, {{IPA|/f/}}, and {{IPA|/j/}} (written {{angbr|ll}}) are not native to Guarani, but come from Spanish.\n\nOral {{IPA|[\u1d48j]}} is often pronounced {{IPA|[d\u0292], [\u025f], [\u0292], [j]}}, depending on the dialect, but the nasal allophone is always {{IPA|[\u0272]}}.\n\nThe dorsal fricative is in free variation between {{IPA|[x]}} and {{IPA|[h]}}.\n\n{{angbr|g}}, {{angbr|gu}} are approximants, not fricatives, but are sometimes transcribed {{IPA|[\u0263], [\u0263\u02b7]}}, as is conventional for Spanish. {{angbr|gu}} is also transcribed {{IPA|[\u0270\u02b7]}}, which is essentially identical to {{IPA|[w]}}.\n\nAll syllables are open, viz. CV or V, ending in a vowel.\n\n=== Glottal stop ===\nThe [[glottal stop]] is only written between vowels, but occurs phonetically before vowel-initial words. Because of this, Ayala (2000:19) shows that some words have several glottal stops near each other, which consequently undergo a number of different [[dissimilation]] techniques. For example, \"I drink water\" '''a'u'y'' is pronounced ''hau'y''. This suggests that irregularity in verb forms derives from regular sound change processes in the history of Guarani. There also seems to be some degree of variation between how much the glottal stop is dropped (for example ''aru'uka'' > ''aruuka'' > ''aruka'' for \"I bring\"). It is possible that word-internal glottal stops may have been retained from fossilized compounds where the second component was a vowel-initial (and therefore glottal stop\u2013initial) root.<ref name=Ayala>Ayala, Valent\u00edn (2000). ''Gram\u00e1tica Guaran\u00ed''. Asunci\u00f3n: Centro Editorial Paraguayo S.R.L.</ref>{{rp|19}}\n\n=== Nasal harmony ===\nGuarani displays an unusual degree of [[nasal harmony]]. A nasal syllable consists of a nasal vowel, and if the consonant is voiced, it takes its nasal allophone. If a stressed syllable is nasal, the nasality spreads in ''both'' directions until it bumps up against a stressed syllable that is oral. This includes [[affix]]es, [[postposition]]s, and compounding. Voiceless consonants do not have nasal allophones, but they do not interrupt the spread of nasality.\n\nFor example,\n\n:{{IPA|/\u207fdo+\u027eoi+\u207fdu\u02c8p\u00e3+i/}} \u2192 {{IPA|[n\u00f5\u027e\u0303\u00f5\u0129n\u0169\u02c8p\u00e3\u0129]}}\n:{{IPA|/ro+\u1d50bo+po\u02c8r\u00e3/}} \u2192 {{IPA|[\u027e\u0303\u00f5m\u00f5p\u00f5\u02c8\u027e\u0303\u00e3]}}\n\nHowever, a second stressed syllable, with an oral vowel, will not become nasalized:\n:{{IPA|/i\u1d48ja\u02c8k\u00e3\u027ea\u02c8ku/}} \u2192 {{IPA|[\u0294\u0129\u0272\u00e3\u02c8k\u00e3\u027e\u0303\u00e3\u02c8ku]}}\n:{{IPA|/a\u02c8k\u00e3\u027ea\u02c8we/}} \u2192 {{IPA|[\u0294\u00e3\u02c8k\u00e3\u027e\u0303\u00e3\u02c8we]}}<ref>Walker (2000) ''Nasalization, neutral segments, and opacity effects'', p. 210</ref>\n\nThat is, for a word with a single stressed vowel, all voiced segments will be either oral or nasal, while voiceless consonants are unaffected, as in oral {{IPA|/\u1d50bot\u0268/}} vs nasal {{IPA|/m\u00f5t\u0268\u0303/}}.\n\n== Grammar ==\nGuaran\u00ed is a highly [[agglutinative language]], often classified as [[polysynthetic]]. It is a fluid-S type [[active language]], and it has been classified as a 6th class language in [[Milewski's typology]]. It uses [[subject\u2013verb\u2013object]] word order usually, but [[OV language|object\u2013verb]] when the subject is not specified.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Tonhauser|first1=Judith|author1link=Judith Tonhauser|last2=Colijn|first2=Erika|title=Word Order in Paraguayan Guarani|journal=International Journal of American Linguistics|date=2010|volume=76|issue=2|pages=255\u2013288|doi=10.1086/652267}}</ref>\n\nThe language lacks [[Grammatical gender|gender]] and has no [[definite article]], but due to influence from Spanish, '''la''' is used as a definite article for singular reference, and '''lo'''  for plural reference. These are not found in Classical Guarani (''Guaraniete'').\n\n=== Nouns ===\nGuarani exhibits nominal tense: past, expressed with ''-kue'', and future, expressed with ''-r\u00e3''. For example, ''tet\u00e3 ruvichakue'' translates to \"ex-president\" while ''tet\u00e3 ruvichar\u00e3'' translates to \"president-elect.\" The past morpheme ''-kue'' is often translated as \"ex-\", \"former\", \"abandoned\", \"what was once\", or \"one-time\". These morphemes can even be combined to express the idea of something that was going to be but didn't end up happening. So for example, ''pa'ir\u00e3gue'' is \"a person who studied to be a priest but didn't actually finish\", or rather, \"the ex-future priest\". Note that some nouns use ''-re'' instead of ''-kue'' and others use ''-gu\u00e3'' instead of ''-r\u00e3''.<ref>{{cite book|last=Guasch|first=P.

The names for these classes stem from the names of the prefixes for 1st and 2nd person singular.\n\nThe areal conjugation is used to convey that the participant is [[Agent (grammar)|actively involved]], whereas the chendal conjugation is used to convey that the participant is the [[Patient (grammar)|undergoer]]. Note that intransitive verbs can take either conjugation, transitive verbs normally take areal, but can take chendal for [[habitual]] readings. Nouns can also be conjugated, but only as chendal. This conveys a predicative possessive reading.<ref name=Caralho1993>Caralho, Jao de(1993) Peixes de \u00c1m\u00e9rica do Sul, Universidade de Rio de Janeiro</ref>\n\nFurthermore, the conjugations vary slightly according to the stem being oral or nasal.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! person\n! areal\n! aireal\n! chendal\n|-\n!\n! walk\n! use\n! be big\n|-\n| 1s\n| a-guata\n| ai-puru\n| che-tuicha\n|-\n| 2s\n| re-guata\n| rei-puru\n| nde-tuicha\n|-\n| 3s\n| o-guata\n| oi-puru\n| i-tuicha\n|-\n| 1pi\n| ja-guata\n| jai-puru\n| \u00f1ande-tuicha\n|-\n| 1px\n| ro-guata\n| roi-puru\n| ore-tuicha\n|-\n| 2p\n| pe-guata\n| pei-puru\n| pende-tuicha\n|-\n| 3p\n| o-guata\n| oi-puru\n| i-tuicha\n|}\n\nVerb root ''\u00f1e'\u1ebd'' (\"speak\"); nasal verb.\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+ Conjugation of the verb root ''\u00f1e'\u1ebd'' (\"speak\") \n|-\n! colspan=\"3\" | Singular\n! colspan=\"3\" style=\"text-align:center;\"| Plural\n|-\n!Person\n!Prefix\n!\n!Person\n!Prefix\n!\n|-\n||'''1''' che <br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'' 'I' ''\n|| ''a''-\n|| a-\u00f1e'\u1ebd\n|| '''1''' \u00f1ande (incl.) <br /> '' 'we all' '' <br /> '''1''' ore (excl.) <br />'' 'we (just us)' '' || ''\u00f1a''-\n''ro''-\n|| \u00f1a-\u00f1e'\u1ebd\nro-\u00f1e'\u1ebd\n|-\n||'''2''' nde <br /> '' 'You' ''|| ''re''-\n|| re-\u00f1e'\u1ebd\n||'''2''' pe\u1ebd <br /> '' 'You all' ''|| ''pe''-\n|| pe-\u00f1e'\u1ebd\n|-\n||'''3''' ha'e <br /> '' 'S/he' ''|| ''o''-\n|| o-\u00f1e'\u1ebd\n||'''3''' ha'eku\u00e9ra <br /> '' 'They' ''|| ''o''-\n|| o-\u00f1e'\u1ebd\n|}\n\n==== Negation ====\nNegation is indicated by a [[circumfix]] ''n(d)(V)-...-(r)i'' in Guarani. The preverbal portion of the circumfix is ''nd-'' for oral bases and'' n-'' for nasal bases. For 2nd person singular, an [[epenthetic]] ''e'' is inserted before the base, for 1st person plural inclusive, an epenthetic ''a'' is inserted.\n\nThe postverbal portion is ''-ri'' for bases ending in ''-i'', and ''-i'' for all others. However, in spoken Guarani, the \"-ri\" portion of the circumfix is frequently omitted for bases ending in \"-i\".\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!Oral verb\n''japo'' (do, make)\n!Nasal verb\n''koror\u00f5'' (roar, snore)\n!With ending in \"i\"\n''jupi'' (go up, rise)\n|-\n||nd-ajap\u00f3-i || n-akoror\u00f5-i || nd-ajup\u00ed-ri\n|-\n||nde-rejap\u00f3-i || ne-rekoror\u00f5-i || nde-rejup\u00ed-ri\n|-\n||nd-ojap\u00f3-i || n-okoror\u00f5-i || nd-ojup\u00ed-ri\n|-\n||nda-jajap\u00f3-i || na-\u00f1akoror\u00f5-i || nda-jajup\u00ed-ri\n|-\n||nd-orojap\u00f3-i || n-orokoror\u00f5-i || nd-orojup\u00ed-ri\n|-\n||nda-pejap\u00f3-i || na-pekoror\u00f5-i || nda-pejup\u00ed-ri\n|-\n||nd-ojap\u00f3-i || n-okoror\u00f5-i  || nd-ojup\u00ed-ri\n|}\n\nThe negation can be used in all tenses, but for future or irrealis reference, the normal tense marking is replaced by ''mo'\u00e3'', resulting in ''n(d)''(V)''-base-mo'\u00e3-i'' as in ''Ndajapomo'\u00e3i'', \"I won't do it\".\n\nThere are also other negatives, such as: ''ani'', ''\u1ef9h\u1ef9'', ''nah\u00e1niri'', ''naumbre'', ''na<nowiki>'</nowiki>anga''.\n\n=== Tense and aspect morphemes ===\n* -'''ramo''': marks extreme proximity of the action, often translating to \"just barely\": ''Oguah\u1ebdramo'', \"He just barely arrived\".<ref name=\"Graham, 1969\">{{cite book|last=Graham|first=Charles R.|title=Guarani Intermediate Course|year=1969|publisher=Brigham Young University|location=Provo}}</ref>{{rp|198}}\n* -'''kuri''': marks proximity of the action. ''Ha'ukuri'', \"I just ate\" (''ha'u'' irregular first person singular form of ''u'', \"to eat\"). It can also be used after a pronoun, ''ha che kuri, che po'a'', \"and about what happened to me, I was lucky\".\n* -'''va'ekue''': indicates a fact that occurred long ago and asserts that it's really truth. ''Oka\u00f1yva'ekue'', \"he/she went missing a long time ago\".\n* -'''ra'e''': tells that the speaker was doubtful before but he's sure at the moment he speaks. ''Nde rejoguara'e pete\u0129 ta'angambyry pyahu'', \"so then you bought a new television after all\".\n* -'''raka'e''': expresses the uncertainty of a perfect-aspect fact. ''Pe\u1ebd peikoraka'e Asunci\u00f3n-pe'', \"I think you lived in Asunci\u00f3n for a while\". Nevertheless, nowadays this morpheme has lost some of its meaning, having a correspondence with ''ra'e'' and ''va'ekue''.\nThe verb form without suffixes at all is a [[present tense|present]] somewhat [[aorist]]: ''Upe \u00e1ra res\u1ebd reho mombyry'', \"that day you got out and you went far\".\n* -'''ta''': is a [[future tense|future]] of immediate happening, it's also used as authoritarian [[imperative mood|imperative]]. ''Ouje\u00fdta ag\u0303aite'', \"he/she'll come back soon\".\n* -'''ma''': has the meaning of \"already\". ''Ajap\u00f3ma'', \"I already did it\".\nThese two suffixes can be added together: ''ah\u00e1tama'', \"I'm already going\".\n* -'''va'er\u00e3''': indicates something not imminent or something that must be done for social or moral reasons, in this case corresponding to the [[german language|German]] [[modal verb]] ''sollen''. ''P\u00e9a ojejapova'er\u00e3'', \"that must be done\".\n* -'''ne''': indicates something that probably will happen or something the speaker imagines that is happening. It correlates in a certain way with the [[subjunctive]] of [[Spanish Language|Spanish]]. ''Mit\u00e3ngu\u00e9ra \u00e1g\u0303a og\u0303uah\u00e9ne h\u00f3gape'', \"the children are probably coming home now\".\n* -'''h\u00edna''', ''\u00edna'' after nasal words: continual action at the moment of speaking, present and pluperfect continuous or emphatic. ''Rojatapyh\u00edna'', \"we're making fire\"; ''che ha'eh\u00edna'', \"it's ME!\".\n* -'''vo''': it has a subtle difference with ''h\u00edna'' in which ''vo'' indicates not necessarily what's being done at the moment of speaking. ''amba'ap\u00f3vo'', \"I'm working (not necessarily now)\".\n* -'''pota''': indicates proximity immediately before the start of the process. ''Ajukapota'', \"I'm near the point at which I will start to kill\" or \"I'm just about to kill\". (A particular sandhi rule is applied here: if the verbs ends in \"po\", the suffix changes to ''mbota''; ''ajapombota'', \"I'll do it right now\").\n* -'''pa''': indicates emphatically that a process has all finished. ''Amboparapa pe ogyke'', \"I painted the wall completely\".\nThis suffix can be joined with ''ma'', making up ''p\u00e1ma'': ''\u00f1ande jaikuaap\u00e1ma nde remimo'\u00e3'', \"now we came to know all your thought\".\n* -'''mi''': customary action in the past: ''Oumi'', \"He used to come a lot\".\nThese are unstressed suffixes: ''ta'', ''ma'', ''ne'', ''vo'', \"mi\"; so the stress goes upon the last syllable of the verb or the last stressed syllable.\n\n=== Other verbal morphemes ===\n* -'''se''': desiderative suffix: \"(Che) a\u00f1emoaranduse\", \"I want to study\".<ref name=\"Blair 1\">{{cite book|last=Blair|first=Robert|title=Guarani Basic Course: Book 1|year=1968|page=50|display-authors=etal}}</ref>\n* '''te'''-: desiderative prefix: ''Ahasa'', \"I pass\", ''Tahasa'', \"I would like to pass.\" Note that ''te-'' is the underlying form. It is similar to the negative in that it has the same vowel alternations and deletions, depending on the person marker on the verb.<ref name=\"Graham, 1969\" />{{rp|108}}\n\n== Determiners ==\n{|class=wikitable\n|-\n! style=\"width:30%;\"|Guarani !!

Many of these loans were for things or concepts unknown to the [[New World]] prior to [[Spanish colonization of the Americas|Spanish colonization]]. Examples are seen below:<ref>Pinta, J.

Other words are: \"[[agouti]]\" from ''akuti'', \"[[tapir]]\" from ''tapira'', \"[[a\u00e7a\u00ed]]\" from ''\u0129wasa'i'' (\"[fruit that] cries or expels water\"), and \"[[warrah]]\" from ''aguar\u00e1'' meaning \"fox\".  [[Carapichea ipecacuanha|Ipecacuanha]] (the name of a medicinal drug) comes from a homonymous Tupi-Guaran\u00ed name that can be rendered as ''ipe-kaa-guene'', meaning a creeping plant that makes one vomit.<ref>''Oxford English Dictionary'', \"Ipecacuanha\".</ref>\n\nThe name of Paraguay is itself a Guarani word, as is the name of [[Uruguay]]. However, the exact meaning of either placename is up to varied interpretations. (''See'': [[List of country-name etymologies#P|List of country-name etymologies]].)\n\n\"[[Cougar]]\" is borrowed from the archaic Portuguese \u00e7u\u00e7uarana; the term was either originally derived from the [[Tupi language]] ''susua'rana'', meaning \"similar to deer (in hair color)\" or from the Guaran\u00ed language term ''gua\u00e7u ara'' while ''puma'' comes from the Peruvian [[Quechua language]].\n\n== Sample text ==\nArticle 1 of the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]] in Guarani:\n\n''Mayma yvyp\u00f3ra ou ko yvy \u00e1ri i\u00f1apyty'yre ha ete\u0129cha tekoruvicharenda ha akat\u00faape jeguerek\u00f3pe; ha ikatu rupi oikuaa a\u00f1et\u00e9va ha a\u00f1ete'yva, ipor\u00e3va ha iva\u00edva, tekotev\u1ebd pehengu\u00e9icha oiko o\u00f1ondiveku\u00e9ra.''<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.omniglot.com/writing/guarani.htm |title=Guarani language, alphabet and pronunciation |publisher=Omniglot.com |accessdate=2013-08-26}}</ref>\n\n(All human beings are born free and equal in dignity and rights.

This represents a unique anomaly in the [[Americas]], where [[language shift]] towards European colonial languages (in this case, the other [[official language]] of [[Spanish language|Spanish]]) has otherwise been a nearly universal cultural and identity marker of [[mestizo]]s (people of mixed [[Spanish people|Spanish]] and [[Amerindian]] ancestry).\n\n[[Jesuit]] priest [[Antonio Ruiz de Montoya]], who in 1639 published the first written grammar of Guarani in a book called ''[[Tesoro de la lengua guaran\u00ed]]'' (Treasure of the Guarani Language / <!-- The Spanish word \"tesoro\" means both \"treasure\" and \"thesaurus\", and makes this title a double entendre. The English word \"treasure\" is cognate with \"thesaurus\" and is also cognate with the Spanish word \"tesoro\". All words descend from the Ancient Greek word \"th\u0113saur\u00f3s\". --> The Guarani Language [[Thesaurus]]), described it as a language \"so copious and elegant that it can compete with the most famous [of languages]\".\n\nThe name \"Guarani\" is generally used for the official language of Paraguay. However, this is part of a [[dialect chain]], most of whose [[Guarani dialects|components]] are also often called Guarani.\n\n== History ==\nThe persistence of Guarani is, contrary to popular belief, not exclusively, or even primarily, due to the influence of the Jesuits in Paraguay.{{citation needed|date=September 2017}} While Guarani was the only language spoken in the expansive missionary territories, Paraguayan Guarani has its roots outside of the [[Jesuit Reductions|Jesuit reductions]].\n\nModern scholarship has shown that Guarani was always the primary language of colonial Paraguay, both inside and outside the reductions. Following the [[Suppression of the Society of Jesus|expulsion of the Jesuits]] in the 18th century, the residents of the reductions gradually migrated north and west towards [[Asunci\u00f3n]], a demographic shift that brought about a decidedly one-sided shift away from the Jesuit dialect that the missionaries had curated in the southern and eastern territories of the colony.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Wilde|first1=Guillermo|title=Los guaran\u00edes despu\u00e9s de la expulsi\u00f3n de los jesuitas: din\u00e1micas pol\u00edticas y transacciones simb\u00f3licas.|journal=[[Revista Complutense de Historia de Am\u00e9rica]]|date=2001|volume=27 |pages=69-106|language=Spanish}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last1=Telesca|first1=Ignacio|title=Tras los expulsos: cambios demogr\u00e1ficos y territoriales en el paraguay despu\u00e9s de la expulsi\u00f3n de los jesuitas|date=2009|publisher=Universidad Cat\u00f3lica \"Nuestra Se\u00f1ora De La Asunci\u00f3n\"|location=Asunci\u00f3n}}</ref>\n\nBy and large, the Guarani of the Jesuits shied away from direct phonological loans from Spanish. Instead, the missionaries relied on the agglutinative nature of the language to formulate [[calque]] terms from native morphemes. This process often led the Jesuits to employ complicated, highly synthetic terms to convey Western concepts.<ref>{{cite book|author1=Harald Thun|authorlink1=La hispanizaci\u00f3n del guaran\u00ed jesu\u00edtico en 'lo espiritual' y en 'lo temporal'.

Its modern alphabet is basically a subset of the [[Latin script]] (with \"J\", \"K\" and \"Y\" but not \"W\"), complemented with two diacritics and six [[digraph (orthography)|digraphs]]. Its [[orthography]] is largely phonemic, with letter values mostly similar to those of [[Spanish language|Spanish]]. The [[tilde]] is used with many letters that are considered part of the alphabet. In the case of \u00d1/\u00f1, it differentiates the palatal nasal from the alveolar nasal (as in Spanish), whereas it marks stressed [[nasalization|nasalisation]] when used over a vowel (as in [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]]): \u00e3, \u1ebd, \u0129, \u00f5, \u0169, \u1ef9. (Nasal vowels have been written with several other diacritics: \u00e4, \u0101, \u00e2, \u00e3.) The tilde also marks nasality in the case of G\u0303/g\u0303, used to represent the [[nasalized velar approximant]] by combining the [[velar approximant]] \"G\" with the [[Nasalisation|nasalising]] [[tilde]]. The letter G\u0303/g\u0303, which is unique to this language, was introduced into the orthography relatively recently during the mid-20th century and there is disagreement over its use. It is not a [[precomposed character]] in [[Unicode]], which can cause typographic inconveniences \u2013 such as needing to press \"delete\" twice \u2013 or imperfect rendering when using computers and fonts that do not properly support the complex layout feature of glyph composition.\n\nOnly stressed nasal vowels are written as nasal. If an oral vowel is stressed, and it is not the final syllable, it is marked with an acute accent: \u00e1, \u00e9, \u00ed, \u00f3, \u00fa, \u00fd. That is, stress falls on the vowel marked as nasalized, if any, else on the accent-marked syllable, and if neither appears, then on the final syllable.\n\nFor [[blind people]] there is also a [[Guarani Braille]].\n\n== Phonology ==\nGuarani syllables consist of a consonant plus a vowel or a vowel alone; syllables ending in a consonant or two or more consonants together do not occur. This is represented as ''(C)V(V)''.\n\n* [[Vowels]]: {{IPA|/a/, /e/, /i/, /o/, /u/}} correspond more or less to the Spanish and IPA equivalents, although sometimes the [[allophones]] {{IPA|[\u025b]}}, {{IPA|[\u0254]}} are used more frequently; the grapheme {{angbr|y}} represents the vowel {{IPAslink|\u0268}} (as in [[Latgalian language|Latgalian]]).\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center;\"\n|+ Oral and nasal vowels\n! !!

The oral allophones of the voiced stops are [[prenasalized]].\n\nThere is also a sequence {{IPA|/\u207ft/}} (written {{angbr|nt}}). A trill {{IPA|/r/}} (written {{angbr|rr}}), and the consonants {{IPA|/l/}}, {{IPA|/f/}}, and {{IPA|/j/}} (written {{angbr|ll}}) are not native to Guarani, but come from Spanish.\n\nOral {{IPA|[\u1d48j]}} is often pronounced {{IPA|[d\u0292], [\u025f], [\u0292], [j]}}, depending on the dialect, but the nasal allophone is always {{IPA|[\u0272]}}.\n\nThe dorsal fricative is in free variation between {{IPA|[x]}} and {{IPA|[h]}}.\n\n{{angbr|g}}, {{angbr|gu}} are approximants, not fricatives, but are sometimes transcribed {{IPA|[\u0263], [\u0263\u02b7]}}, as is conventional for Spanish. {{angbr|gu}} is also transcribed {{IPA|[\u0270\u02b7]}}, which is essentially identical to {{IPA|[w]}}.\n\nAll syllables are open, viz. CV or V, ending in a vowel.\n\n=== Glottal stop ===\nThe [[glottal stop]] is only written between vowels, but occurs phonetically before vowel-initial words. Because of this, Ayala (2000:19) shows that some words have several glottal stops near each other, which consequently undergo a number of different [[dissimilation]] techniques. For example, \"I drink water\" '''a'u'y'' is pronounced ''hau'y''. This suggests that irregularity in verb forms derives from regular sound change processes in the history of Guarani. There also seems to be some degree of variation between how much the glottal stop is dropped (for example ''aru'uka'' > ''aruuka'' > ''aruka'' for \"I bring\"). It is possible that word-internal glottal stops may have been retained from fossilized compounds where the second component was a vowel-initial (and therefore glottal stop\u2013initial) root.<ref name=Ayala>Ayala, Valent\u00edn (2000). ''Gram\u00e1tica Guaran\u00ed''. Asunci\u00f3n: Centro Editorial Paraguayo S.R.L.</ref>{{rp|19}}\n\n=== Nasal harmony ===\nGuarani displays an unusual degree of [[nasal harmony]]. A nasal syllable consists of a nasal vowel, and if the consonant is voiced, it takes its nasal allophone. If a stressed syllable is nasal, the nasality spreads in ''both'' directions until it bumps up against a stressed syllable that is oral. This includes [[affix]]es, [[postposition]]s, and compounding. Voiceless consonants do not have nasal allophones, but they do not interrupt the spread of nasality.\n\nFor example,\n\n:{{IPA|/\u207fdo+\u027eoi+\u207fdu\u02c8p\u00e3+i/}} \u2192 {{IPA|[n\u00f5\u027e\u0303\u00f5\u0129n\u0169\u02c8p\u00e3\u0129]}}\n:{{IPA|/ro+\u1d50bo+po\u02c8r\u00e3/}} \u2192 {{IPA|[\u027e\u0303\u00f5m\u00f5p\u00f5\u02c8\u027e\u0303\u00e3]}}\n\nHowever, a second stressed syllable, with an oral vowel, will not become nasalized:\n:{{IPA|/i\u1d48ja\u02c8k\u00e3\u027ea\u02c8ku/}} \u2192 {{IPA|[\u0294\u0129\u0272\u00e3\u02c8k\u00e3\u027e\u0303\u00e3\u02c8ku]}}\n:{{IPA|/a\u02c8k\u00e3\u027ea\u02c8we/}} \u2192 {{IPA|[\u0294\u00e3\u02c8k\u00e3\u027e\u0303\u00e3\u02c8we]}}<ref>Walker (2000) ''Nasalization, neutral segments, and opacity effects'', p. 210</ref>\n\nThat is, for a word with a single stressed vowel, all voiced segments will be either oral or nasal, while voiceless consonants are unaffected, as in oral {{IPA|/\u1d50bot\u0268/}} vs nasal {{IPA|/m\u00f5t\u0268\u0303/}}.\n\n== Grammar ==\nGuaran\u00ed is a highly [[agglutinative language]], often classified as [[polysynthetic]]. It is a fluid-S type [[active language]], and it has been classified as a 6th class language in [[Milewski's typology]]. It uses [[subject\u2013verb\u2013object]] word order usually, but [[OV language|object\u2013verb]] when the subject is not specified.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Tonhauser|first1=Judith|author1link=Judith Tonhauser|last2=Colijn|first2=Erika|title=Word Order in Paraguayan Guarani|journal=International Journal of American Linguistics|date=2010|volume=76|issue=2|pages=255\u2013288|doi=10.1086/652267}}</ref>\n\nThe language lacks [[Grammatical gender|gender]] and has no [[definite article]], but due to influence from Spanish, '''la''' is used as a definite article for singular reference, and '''lo'''  for plural reference. These are not found in Classical Guarani (''Guaraniete'').\n\n=== Nouns ===\nGuarani exhibits nominal tense: past, expressed with ''-kue'', and future, expressed with ''-r\u00e3''. For example, ''tet\u00e3 ruvichakue'' translates to \"ex-president\" while ''tet\u00e3 ruvichar\u00e3'' translates to \"president-elect.\" The past morpheme ''-kue'' is often translated as \"ex-\", \"former\", \"abandoned\", \"what was once\", or \"one-time\". These morphemes can even be combined to express the idea of something that was going to be but didn't end up happening. So for example, ''pa'ir\u00e3gue'' is \"a person who studied to be a priest but didn't actually finish\", or rather, \"the ex-future priest\". Note that some nouns use ''-re'' instead of ''-kue'' and others use ''-gu\u00e3'' instead of ''-r\u00e3''.<ref>{{cite book|last=Guasch|first=P.

The names for these classes stem from the names of the prefixes for 1st and 2nd person singular.\n\nThe areal conjugation is used to convey that the participant is [[Agent (grammar)|actively involved]], whereas the chendal conjugation is used to convey that the participant is the [[Patient (grammar)|undergoer]]. Note that intransitive verbs can take either conjugation, transitive verbs normally take areal, but can take chendal for [[habitual]] readings. Nouns can also be conjugated, but only as chendal. This conveys a predicative possessive reading.<ref name=Caralho1993>Caralho, Jao de(1993) Peixes de \u00c1m\u00e9rica do Sul, Universidade de Rio de Janeiro</ref>\n\nFurthermore, the conjugations vary slightly according to the stem being oral or nasal.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! person\n! areal\n! aireal\n! chendal\n|-\n!\n! walk\n! use\n! be big\n|-\n| 1s\n| a-guata\n| ai-puru\n| che-tuicha\n|-\n| 2s\n| re-guata\n| rei-puru\n| nde-tuicha\n|-\n| 3s\n| o-guata\n| oi-puru\n| i-tuicha\n|-\n| 1pi\n| ja-guata\n| jai-puru\n| \u00f1ande-tuicha\n|-\n| 1px\n| ro-guata\n| roi-puru\n| ore-tuicha\n|-\n| 2p\n| pe-guata\n| pei-puru\n| pende-tuicha\n|-\n| 3p\n| o-guata\n| oi-puru\n| i-tuicha\n|}\n\nVerb root ''\u00f1e'\u1ebd'' (\"speak\"); nasal verb.\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+ Conjugation of the verb root ''\u00f1e'\u1ebd'' (\"speak\") \n|-\n! colspan=\"3\" | Singular\n! colspan=\"3\" style=\"text-align:center;\"| Plural\n|-\n!Person\n!Prefix\n!\n!Person\n!Prefix\n!\n|-\n||'''1''' che <br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'' 'I' ''\n|| ''a''-\n|| a-\u00f1e'\u1ebd\n|| '''1''' \u00f1ande (incl.) <br /> '' 'we all' '' <br /> '''1''' ore (excl.) <br />'' 'we (just us)' '' || ''\u00f1a''-\n''ro''-\n|| \u00f1a-\u00f1e'\u1ebd\nro-\u00f1e'\u1ebd\n|-\n||'''2''' nde <br /> '' 'You' ''|| ''re''-\n|| re-\u00f1e'\u1ebd\n||'''2''' pe\u1ebd <br /> '' 'You all' ''|| ''pe''-\n|| pe-\u00f1e'\u1ebd\n|-\n||'''3''' ha'e <br /> '' 'S/he' ''|| ''o''-\n|| o-\u00f1e'\u1ebd\n||'''3''' ha'eku\u00e9ra <br /> '' 'They' ''|| ''o''-\n|| o-\u00f1e'\u1ebd\n|}\n\n==== Negation ====\nNegation is indicated by a [[circumfix]] ''n(d)(V)-...-(r)i'' in Guarani. The preverbal portion of the circumfix is ''nd-'' for oral bases and'' n-'' for nasal bases. For 2nd person singular, an [[epenthetic]] ''e'' is inserted before the base, for 1st person plural inclusive, an epenthetic ''a'' is inserted.\n\nThe postverbal portion is ''-ri'' for bases ending in ''-i'', and ''-i'' for all others. However, in spoken Guarani, the \"-ri\" portion of the circumfix is frequently omitted for bases ending in \"-i\".\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!Oral verb\n''japo'' (do, make)\n!Nasal verb\n''koror\u00f5'' (roar, snore)\n!With ending in \"i\"\n''jupi'' (go up, rise)\n|-\n||nd-ajap\u00f3-i || n-akoror\u00f5-i || nd-ajup\u00ed-ri\n|-\n||nde-rejap\u00f3-i || ne-rekoror\u00f5-i || nde-rejup\u00ed-ri\n|-\n||nd-ojap\u00f3-i || n-okoror\u00f5-i || nd-ojup\u00ed-ri\n|-\n||nda-jajap\u00f3-i || na-\u00f1akoror\u00f5-i || nda-jajup\u00ed-ri\n|-\n||nd-orojap\u00f3-i || n-orokoror\u00f5-i || nd-orojup\u00ed-ri\n|-\n||nda-pejap\u00f3-i || na-pekoror\u00f5-i || nda-pejup\u00ed-ri\n|-\n||nd-ojap\u00f3-i || n-okoror\u00f5-i  || nd-ojup\u00ed-ri\n|}\n\nThe negation can be used in all tenses, but for future or irrealis reference, the normal tense marking is replaced by ''mo'\u00e3'', resulting in ''n(d)''(V)''-base-mo'\u00e3-i'' as in ''Ndajapomo'\u00e3i'', \"I won't do it\".\n\nThere are also other negatives, such as: ''ani'', ''\u1ef9h\u1ef9'', ''nah\u00e1niri'', ''naumbre'', ''na<nowiki>'</nowiki>anga''.\n\n=== Tense and aspect morphemes ===\n* -'''ramo''': marks extreme proximity of the action, often translating to \"just barely\": ''Oguah\u1ebdramo'', \"He just barely arrived\".<ref name=\"Graham, 1969\">{{cite book|last=Graham|first=Charles R.|title=Guarani Intermediate Course|year=1969|publisher=Brigham Young University|location=Provo}}</ref>{{rp|198}}\n* -'''kuri''': marks proximity of the action. ''Ha'ukuri'', \"I just ate\" (''ha'u'' irregular first person singular form of ''u'', \"to eat\"). It can also be used after a pronoun, ''ha che kuri, che po'a'', \"and about what happened to me, I was lucky\".\n* -'''va'ekue''': indicates a fact that occurred long ago and asserts that it's really truth. ''Oka\u00f1yva'ekue'', \"he/she went missing a long time ago\".\n* -'''ra'e''': tells that the speaker was doubtful before but he's sure at the moment he speaks. ''Nde rejoguara'e pete\u0129 ta'angambyry pyahu'', \"so then you bought a new television after all\".\n* -'''raka'e''': expresses the uncertainty of a perfect-aspect fact. ''Pe\u1ebd peikoraka'e Asunci\u00f3n-pe'', \"I think you lived in Asunci\u00f3n for a while\". Nevertheless, nowadays this morpheme has lost some of its meaning, having a correspondence with ''ra'e'' and ''va'ekue''.\nThe verb form without suffixes at all is a [[present tense|present]] somewhat [[aorist]]: ''Upe \u00e1ra res\u1ebd reho mombyry'', \"that day you got out and you went far\".\n* -'''ta''': is a [[future tense|future]] of immediate happening, it's also used as authoritarian [[imperative mood|imperative]]. ''Ouje\u00fdta ag\u0303aite'', \"he/she'll come back soon\".\n* -'''ma''': has the meaning of \"already\". ''Ajap\u00f3ma'', \"I already did it\".\nThese two suffixes can be added together: ''ah\u00e1tama'', \"I'm already going\".\n* -'''va'er\u00e3''': indicates something not imminent or something that must be done for social or moral reasons, in this case corresponding to the [[german language|German]] [[modal verb]] ''sollen''. ''P\u00e9a ojejapova'er\u00e3'', \"that must be done\".\n* -'''ne''': indicates something that probably will happen or something the speaker imagines that is happening. It correlates in a certain way with the [[subjunctive]] of [[Spanish Language|Spanish]]. ''Mit\u00e3ngu\u00e9ra \u00e1g\u0303a og\u0303uah\u00e9ne h\u00f3gape'', \"the children are probably coming home now\".\n* -'''h\u00edna''', ''\u00edna'' after nasal words: continual action at the moment of speaking, present and pluperfect continuous or emphatic. ''Rojatapyh\u00edna'', \"we're making fire\"; ''che ha'eh\u00edna'', \"it's ME!\".\n* -'''vo''': it has a subtle difference with ''h\u00edna'' in which ''vo'' indicates not necessarily what's being done at the moment of speaking. ''amba'ap\u00f3vo'', \"I'm working (not necessarily now)\".\n* -'''pota''': indicates proximity immediately before the start of the process. ''Ajukapota'', \"I'm near the edge in which I will start to kill\". (A particular sandhi rule is applied here: if the verbs ends in \"po\", the suffix changes to ''mbota''; ''ajapombota'', \"I'll do it right now\").\n* -'''pa''': indicates emphatically that a process has all finished. ''Amboparapa pe ogyke'', \"I painted the wall completely\".\nThis suffix can be joined with ''ma'', making up ''p\u00e1ma'': ''\u00f1ande jaikuaap\u00e1ma nde remimo'\u00e3'', \"now we became to know all your thought\".\n* -'''mi''': customary action in the past: ''Oumi'', \"He used to come a lot\".\nThese are unstressed suffixes: ''ta'', ''ma'', ''ne'', ''vo'', \"mi\"; so the stress goes upon the last syllable of the verb or the last stressed syllable.\n\n=== Other verbal morphemes ===\n* -'''se''': desiderative suffix: \"(Che) a\u00f1emoaranduse\", \"I want to study\".<ref name=\"Blair 1\">{{cite book|last=Blair|first=Robert|title=Guarani Basic Course: Book 1|year=1968|page=50|display-authors=etal}}</ref>\n* '''te'''-: desiderative prefix: ''Ahasa'', \"I pass\", ''Tahasa'', \"I would like to pass.\" Note that ''te-'' is the underlying form. It is similar to the negative in that it has the same vowel alternations and deletions, depending on the person marker on the verb.<ref name=\"Graham, 1969\" />{{rp|108}}\n\n== Determiners ==\n{|class=wikitable\n|-\n! style=\"width:30%;\"|Guarani !!

Many of these loans were for things or concepts unknown to the [[New World]] prior to [[Spanish colonization of the Americas|Spanish colonization]]. Examples are seen below:<ref>Pinta, J.

Other words are: \"[[agouti]]\" from ''akuti'', \"[[tapir]]\" from ''tapira'', \"[[a\u00e7a\u00ed]]\" from ''\u0129wasa'i'' (\"[fruit that] cries or expels water\"), and \"[[warrah]]\" from ''aguar\u00e1'' meaning \"fox\".  [[Carapichea ipecacuanha|Ipecacuanha]] (the name of a medicinal drug) comes from a homonymous Tupi-Guaran\u00ed name that can be rendered as ''ipe-kaa-guene'', meaning a creeping plant that makes one vomit.<ref>''Oxford English Dictionary'', \"Ipecacuanha\".</ref>\n\nThe name of Paraguay is itself a Guarani word, as is the name of [[Uruguay]]. However, the exact meaning of either placename is up to varied interpretations. (''See'': [[List of country-name etymologies#P|List of country-name etymologies]].)\n\n\"[[Cougar]]\" is borrowed from the archaic Portuguese \u00e7u\u00e7uarana; the term was either originally derived from the [[Tupi language]] ''susua'rana'', meaning \"similar to deer (in hair color)\" or from the Guaran\u00ed language term ''gua\u00e7u ara'' while ''puma'' comes from the Peruvian [[Quechua language]].\n\n== Sample text ==\nArticle 1 of the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]] in Guarani:\n\n''Mayma yvyp\u00f3ra ou ko yvy \u00e1ri i\u00f1apyty'yre ha ete\u0129cha tekoruvicharenda ha akat\u00faape jeguerek\u00f3pe; ha ikatu rupi oikuaa a\u00f1et\u00e9va ha a\u00f1ete'yva, ipor\u00e3va ha iva\u00edva, tekotev\u1ebd pehengu\u00e9icha oiko o\u00f1ondiveku\u00e9ra.''<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.omniglot.com/writing/guarani.htm |title=Guarani language, alphabet and pronunciation |publisher=Omniglot.com |accessdate=2013-08-26}}</ref>\n\n(All human beings are born free and equal in dignity and rights.

In [[human]]s, these two parts are the [[neurocranium]] and the viscerocranium or [[facial skeleton]] that includes the mandible as its largest [[bone]].

In some animals such as horned [[ungulate]]s, the skull also has a defensive function by providing the mount (on the [[frontal bone]]) for the [[horn (anatomy)|horns]].\n\nThe English word \"skull\" is probably derived from [[List of English words of Old Norse origin|Old Norse]] \"skulle\", while the [[Latin]] word ''cranium'' comes from the [[Greek and Latin roots in English|Greek root]] \u03ba\u03c1\u03b1\u03bd\u03af\u03bf\u03bd (''kranion'').\n\nThe skull is made up of a number of fused [[flat bone]]s, and contains many [[foramina]], [[fossa (anatomy)|fossae]], [[process (anatomy)|processes]], and several cavities or [[sinus (anatomy)|sinuses]]. In [[zoology]] there are openings in the skull called [[fenestra]]e.\n\n== Structure of human skull==\n{{about||details and the constituent bones|Neurocranium|and|Facial skeleton}}\n[[File:Lateral head skull.jpg|thumb|180 px|left|Skull in situ]]\n[[File:621 Anatomy of a Flat Bone.jpg|thumb|left|Anatomy of a flat bone - the periosteum of the neurocranium is known as the [[periosteum|pericranium]]]]\n[[File:Sobo 1909 38.png|thumb|right|260px|Human skull from the front]]\n[[File:Human skull side simplified (bones).svg|thumb|right|260px|Side bones of skull]]\nThe '''human skull''' is the [[bone|bony]] structure that forms the [[human head|head]] in the [[human skeleton]].

The membranous viscerocranium includes the [[mandible]].\n\nThe sutures are fairly rigid joints between bones of the neurocranium.\n\nThe facial skeleton is formed by the bones supporting the face.\n\n===Bones===\nExcept for the [[Human mandible|mandible]], all of the bones of the skull are joined together by [[Fibrous joint#Sutures|sutures]]\u2014[[synarthrosis|synarthrodial]] (immovable) [[joints]] formed by bony [[ossification]], with [[Sharpey's fibres]] permitting some flexibility. Sometimes there can be extra bone pieces within the suture known as [[wormian bone]]s or ''sutural bones''. Most commonly these are found in the course of the [[lambdoid suture]].\n\nThe human skull is generally considered to consist of twenty-two [[bone]]s\u2014eight cranial bones and fourteen facial skeleton bones. In the neurocranium these are the [[occipital bone]], two [[temporal bone]]s, two [[parietal bone]]s, the [[sphenoid bone|sphenoid]], [[ethmoid bone|ethmoid]] and [[frontal bone]]s.\n\nThe  bones of the [[facial skeleton]] (14) are the [[vomer]], two [[inferior nasal concha]]e, two [[nasal bone]]s, two [[maxilla]], the [[mandible]], two [[palatine bone]]s, two [[zygomatic bone]]s, and two [[lacrimal bone]]s. Some sources count a paired bone as one, or the maxilla as having two bones (as its parts); some sources include the [[hyoid bone]] or the three [[ossicles]] of the [[middle ear]] but the overall general consensus of the number of bones in the human skull is the stated twenty-two.\n\nSome of these bones\u2014the occipital, parietal, frontal, in the neurocranium, and the nasal, lacrimal, and vomer, in the facial skeleton are [[flat bone]]s.\n\n===Cavities and foramina===\n[[File:3d CT scan animation.gif|thumb|CT scan of a human skull in 3D]]\nThe skull also contains [[Sinus (anatomy)|sinuses]], air-filled cavities known as [[paranasal sinuses]], and numerous [[List of foramina in the human body#Skull|foramina]]. The sinuses are lined with [[respiratory epithelium]]. Their known functions are the lessening of the weight of the skull, the aiding of resonance to the voice and the warming and moistening of the air drawn into the [[nasal cavity]].\n\nThe foramina are openings in the skull. The largest of these is the [[foramen magnum]] that allows the passage of the [[spinal cord]] as well as [[nerve]]s and [[blood vessel]]s.\n\n===Processes===\nThe many [[Process (anatomy)#Examples|processes]] of the skull include the [[mastoid process]] and the [[zygomatic process]]es.\n\n==Development==\n[[File:Sobo 1909 104.png|thumb|left|Skull of a new-born child from the side]]\nThe skull is a complex structure; its bones are formed both by [[intramembranous ossification|intramembranous]] and [[endochondral ossification]]. The [[skull roof]] bones, comprising the bones of the [[facial skeleton]] and the sides and roof of the neurocranium, are [[dermal bone]]s formed by intramembranous ossification, though the [[temporal bone]]s are formed by endochondral ossification. The [[endocranium]], the bones supporting the brain (the [[occipital bone|occipital]], [[sphenoid bone|sphenoid]], and [[ethmoid bone|ethmoid]]) are largely formed by endochondral ossification. Thus frontal and parietal bones are purely membranous.<ref>{{cite book|url=|title=Human Embryology & Developmental Biology|last=Carlson|first=Bruce M.|publisher=Mosby|year=1999|isbn=0-8151-1458-3|edition=Second|location=|page=|pages=166\u2013170|accessdate=}}</ref> The geometry of the [[base of skull|skull base]] and its [[fossa (anatomy)|fossae]], the [[anterior cranial fossa|anterior]], [[middle cranial fossa|middle]] and [[posterior cranial fossa]]e changes rapidly.

During development, many of these bony elements gradually fuse together into solid bone (for example, the [[frontal bone]]). The bones of the [[skull roof|roof of the skull]] are initially separated by regions of dense [[connective tissue]] called [[fontanelles]]. There are six fontanelles: one anterior (or frontal), one posterior (or occipital), two sphenoid (or anterolateral), and two mastoid (or posterolateral). At birth these regions are fibrous and moveable, necessary for birth and later growth. This growth can put a large amount of tension on the \"obstetrical hinge\", which is where the [[Squama occipitalis|squamous]] and [[Lateral parts of occipital bone|lateral parts]] of the [[occipital bone]] meet. A possible complication of this tension is rupture of the [[great cerebral vein]]. As growth and ossification progress, the connective tissue of the fontanelles is invaded and replaced by bone creating [[Suture (anatomical)|suture]]s. The five sutures are the two [[squamosal suture|squamous sutures]], one [[coronal suture|coronal]], one [[lambdoid suture|lambdoid]], and one [[sagittal suture]]. The posterior fontanelle usually closes by eight weeks, but the anterior fontanel can remain open up to eighteen months. The anterior fontanelle is located at the junction of the frontal and parietal bones; it is a \"soft spot\" on a baby's forehead. Careful observation will show that you can count a baby's heart rate by observing the pulse pulsing softly through the anterior fontanelle.\n\nThe skull in the [[neonate]] is large in proportion to other parts of the body. The facial skeleton is one seventh of the size of the [[calvaria (skull)|calvaria]]. (In the adult it is half the size). The [[base of the skull]] is short and narrow, though the [[inner ear]] is almost adult size.<ref name=\"Human Anatomy Volume 3\">{{cite book|title=BD Chaurasia's Human Anatomy: Regional and Applied Dissection and Clinical|last1=Chaurasia|first=B.

Normally the skull protects the brain from damage through its hard unyieldingness; the skull is one of the least deformable structures found in nature with it needing the force of about 1 ton to reduce the diameter of the skull by 1&nbsp;cm.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Holbourn|first=A.

In these cases the raised intracranial pressure can cause herniation of the brain out of the [[foramen magnum]] (\"coning\") because there is no space for the brain to expand; this can result in significant [[brain damage]] or death unless an urgent operation is performed to relieve the pressure. This is why patients with [[concussion]] must be watched extremely carefully.\n\nDating back to [[Neolithic]] times, a skull operation called [[trepanning]] was sometimes performed. This involved drilling a ''burr'' hole in the cranium. Examination of skulls from this period reveals that the patients sometimes survived for many years afterward. It seems likely that trepanning was also performed purely for ritualistic or religious reasons. Nowadays this procedure is still used but is normally called a [[craniectomy]].\n\nIn March 2013, for the first time in the U.S., researchers replaced a large percentage of a patient's skull with a precision, [[3D printing|3D-printed]] [[polymer]] [[Implant (medicine)|implant]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.medicaldaily.com/3d-printed-polymer-skull-implant-used-first-time-us-244583|title=3D-Printed Polymer Skull Implant Used For First Time in US|date=7 March 2013|website=Medical Daily|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130928042619/http://www.medicaldaily.com/3d-printed-polymer-skull-implant-used-first-time-us-244583|archivedate=28 September 2013|url-status=live|accessdate=24 September 2013|df=dmy-all}}</ref> About 9 months later, the first complete cranium replacement with a 3D-printed plastic insert was performed on a Dutch woman.

[[Lamprey]]s and sharks only possess a cartilaginous endocranium, with both the upper and lower [[jaw]]s being separate elements. Bony fishes have additional [[dermal bone]], forming a more or less coherent [[skull roof]] in [[lungfish]] and [[holost]] fish. The lower jaw defines a chin.\n\nThe simpler structure is found in [[jawless fish]], in which the cranium is normally represented by a trough-like basket of cartilaginous elements only partially enclosing the brain, and associated with the capsules for the inner ears and the single nostril. Distinctively, these fish have no jaws.<ref name=\"VB2\" />\n\n[[Cartilaginous fish]], such as [[shark]]s and rays, have also simple, and presumably primitive, skull structures. The cranium is a single structure forming a case around the brain, enclosing the lower surface and the sides, but always at least partially open at the top as a large [[fontanelle]]. The most anterior part of the cranium includes a forward plate of cartilage, the [[rostrum (anatomy)|rostrum]], and capsules to enclose the [[olfactory]] organs. Behind these are the orbits, and then an additional pair of capsules enclosing the structure of the [[inner ear]]. Finally, the skull tapers towards the rear, where the foramen magnum lies immediately above a single [[Condyle (anatomy)|condyle]], articulating with the first [[vertebra]]. There are, in addition, at various points throughout the cranium, smaller [[Foramina of skull|foramina]] for the cranial nerves.

The roof of the skull is generally well formed, and although the exact relationship of its bones to those of tetrapods is unclear, they are usually given similar names for convenience. Other elements of the skull, however, may be reduced; there is little cheek region behind the enlarged orbits, and little, if any bone in between them. The upper jaw is often formed largely from the [[premaxilla]], with the [[maxilla]] itself located further back, and an additional bone, the symplectic, linking the jaw to the rest of the cranium.<ref name=\"VB\"/>\n\nAlthough the skulls of fossil lobe-finned fish resemble those of the early tetrapods, the same cannot be said of those of the living [[lungfish]]es. The [[skull roof]] is not fully formed, and consists of multiple, somewhat irregularly shaped bones with no direct relationship to those of tetrapods. The upper jaw is formed from the [[pterygoid bone|pterygoid]]s and [[vomer]]s alone, all of which bear teeth.

It is overlaying the [[endocranium]], corresponding to the cartilaginous skull in [[sharks]] and [[Batoidea|rays]]. The various separate bones that compose the [[temporal bone]] of humans are also part of the skull roof series. A further plate composed of four pairs of bones forms the roof of the mouth; these include the [[vomer]] and [[palatine bone]]s.

Depending on the lineage of a given animal, two, one, or no pairs of temporal fenestrae may be present, above or below the [[postorbital]] and [[squamosal]] bones. The upper temporal fenestrae are also known as the supratemporal fenestrae, and the lower temporal fenestrae are also known as the [[infratemporal fenestra]]e. The presence and morphology of the temporal fenestra are critical for taxonomic classification of the synapsids, of which mammals are part.\n\nPhysiological speculation associates it with a rise in metabolic rates and an increase in jaw musculature. The earlier amniotes of the Carboniferous did not have temporal fenestrae but two more advanced lines did: the [[synapsid]]s (mammal-like reptiles) and the [[diapsid]]s (most reptiles and later birds). As time progressed, diapsids' and synapsids' temporal fenestrae became more modified and larger to make stronger bites and more jaw muscles. Dinosaurs, which are diapsids, have large advanced openings, and their descendants, the birds, have temporal fenestrae which have been modified. Mammals, which are synapsids, possess one fenestral opening in the skull, situated to the rear of the orbit.\n\n====Classification====\n[[File:Chimpanzee skull.jpg|thumb|right|Chimpanzee skull|258x258px]]\n[[File:Goat skull-FMVZ USP-18.jpeg|thumb|Goat skull.]]\nThere are four types of amniote skull, classified by the number and location of their temporal fenestrae.

Sometimes there can be extra bone pieces within the suture known as [[wormian bone]]s or ''sutural bones''. Most commonly these are found in the course of the [[lambdoid suture]].\n\nThe human skull is generally considered to consist of twenty-two [[bone]]s\u2014eight cranial bones and fourteen facial skeleton bones.

Some sources count a paired bone as one, or the maxilla as having two bones (as its parts); some sources include the [[hyoid bone]] or the three [[ossicles]] of the [[middle ear]] but the overall general consensus of the number of bones in the human skull is the stated twenty-two.\n\nSome of these bones\u2014the occipital, parietal, frontal, in the neurocranium, and the nasal, lacrimal, and vomer, in the facial skeleton are [[flat bone]]s.\n\n===Cavities and foramina===\n[[File:3d CT scan animation.gif|thumb|CT scan of a human skull in 3D]]\nThe skull also contains [[Sinus (anatomy)|sinuses]], air-filled cavities known as [[paranasal sinuses]], and numerous [[List of foramina in the human body#Skull|foramina]].

During development, many of these bony elements gradually fuse together into solid bone (for example, the [[frontal bone]]). The bones of the [[skull roof|roof of the skull]] are initially separated by regions of dense [[connective tissue]] called [[fontanelles]]. There are six fontanelles: one anterior (or frontal), one posterior (or occipital), two sphenoid (or anterolateral), and two mastoid (or posterolateral). At birth these regions are fibrous and moveable, necessary for birth and later growth. This growth can put a large amount of tension on the \"obstetrical hinge\", which is where the [[Squama occipitalis|squamous]] and [[Lateral parts of occipital bone|lateral parts]] of the [[occipital bone]] meet. A possible complication of this tension is rupture of the [[great cerebral vein]]. As growth and ossification progress, the connective tissue of the fontanelles is invaded and replaced by bone creating [[Suture (anatomical)|suture]]s. The five sutures are the two [[squamosal suture|squamous sutures]], one [[coronal suture|coronal]], one [[lambdoid suture|lambdoid]], and one [[sagittal suture]]. The posterior fontanelle usually closes by eight weeks, but the anterior fontanel can remain open up to eighteen months. The anterior fontanelle is located at the junction of the frontal and parietal bones; it is a \"soft spot\" on a baby's forehead. Careful observation will show that you can count a baby's heart rate by observing the pulse pulsing softly through the anterior fontanelle.\n\nThe skull in the [[neonate]] is large in proportion to other parts of the body.

In these cases the raised intracranial pressure can cause herniation of the brain out of the [[foramen magnum]] (\"coning\") because there is no space for the brain to expand; this can result in significant [[brain damage]] or death unless an urgent operation is performed to relieve the pressure. This is why patients with [[concussion]] must be watched extremely carefully.\n\nDating back to [[Neolithic]] times, a skull operation called [[trepanning]] was sometimes performed. This involved drilling a ''burr'' hole in the cranium. Examination of skulls from this period reveals that the patients sometimes survived for many years afterward. It seems likely that trepanning was also performed purely for ritualistic or religious reasons. Nowadays this procedure is still used but is normally called a [[craniectomy]].\n\nIn March 2013, for the first time in the U.S., researchers replaced a large percentage of a patient's skull with a precision, [[3D printing|3D-printed]] [[polymer]] [[Implant (medicine)|implant]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.medicaldaily.com/3d-printed-polymer-skull-implant-used-first-time-us-244583|title=3D-Printed Polymer Skull Implant Used For First Time in US|date=7 March 2013|website=Medical Daily|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130928042619/http://www.medicaldaily.com/3d-printed-polymer-skull-implant-used-first-time-us-244583|archivedate=28 September 2013|url-status=live|accessdate=24 September 2013|df=dmy-all}}</ref> About 9 months later, the first complete cranium replacement with a 3D-printed plastic insert was performed on a Dutch woman.

This procedure would begin just after birth and would be carried on for several years.{{Citation needed|date=December 2018}}\n\n===Osteology===\nLike the face, the skull and teeth can also indicate a person's life history and origin. [[Forensics|Forensic]] scientists and [[archeology|archaeologist]]s use [[Metric (mathematics)|metric]] and nonmetric traits to estimate what the bearer of the skull looked like. When a significant amount of bones are found, such as at [[Spitalfields]] in the UK and [[J\u014dmon]] [[shell mound]]s in Japan, [[Osteology|osteologists]] can use traits, such as the proportions of length, height and width, to know the relationships of the population of the study with other living or extinct populations.{{Citation needed|date=December 2018}}\n\nThe German physician [[Franz Joseph Gall]] in around 1800 formulated the theory of [[phrenology]], which attempted to show that specific features of the skull are associated with certain personality traits or intellectual capabilities of its owner.

[[Lamprey]]s and sharks only possess a cartilaginous endocranium, with both the upper and lower [[jaw]]s being separate elements. Bony fishes have additional [[dermal bone]], forming a more or less coherent [[skull roof]] in [[lungfish]] and [[holost]] fish. The lower jaw defines a chin.\n\nThe simpler structure is found in [[jawless fish]], in which the cranium is normally represented by a trough-like basket of cartilaginous elements only partially enclosing the brain, and associated with the capsules for the inner ears and the single nostril. Distinctively, these fish have no jaws.<ref name=\"VB2\" />\n\n[[Cartilaginous fish]], such as [[shark]]s and rays, have also simple, and presumably primitive, skull structures. The cranium is a single structure forming a case around the brain, enclosing the lower surface and the sides, but always at least partially open at the top as a large [[fontanelle]]. The most anterior part of the cranium includes a forward plate of cartilage, the [[rostrum (anatomy)|rostrum]], and capsules to enclose the [[olfactory]] organs. Behind these are the orbits, and then an additional pair of capsules enclosing the structure of the [[inner ear]]. Finally, the skull tapers towards the rear, where the foramen magnum lies immediately above a single [[Condyle (anatomy)|condyle]], articulating with the first [[vertebra]]. There are, in addition, at various points throughout the cranium, smaller [[Foramina of skull|foramina]] for the cranial nerves. The jaws consist of separate hoops of cartilage, almost always distinct from the cranium proper.<ref name=\"VB2\">{{cite book |last1=Romer |first1=Alfred Sherwood |first2=Parsons |last2=Thomas S. |year=1977 |title=The Vertebrate Body |publisher=Holt-Saunders International |location= Philadelphia, PA |pages=173\u2013177 |isbn= 0-03-910284-X}}</ref>\n\nIn [[ray-finned fish]], there has also been considerable modification from the primitive pattern. The roof of the skull is generally well formed, and although the exact relationship of its bones to those of tetrapods is unclear, they are usually given similar names for convenience. Other elements of the skull, however, may be reduced; there is little cheek region behind the enlarged orbits, and little, if any bone in between them. The upper jaw is often formed largely from the [[premaxilla]], with the [[maxilla]] itself located further back, and an additional bone, the symplectic, linking the jaw to the rest of the cranium.<ref name=\"VB\"/>\n\nAlthough the skulls of fossil lobe-finned fish resemble those of the early tetrapods, the same cannot be said of those of the living [[lungfish]]es. The [[skull roof]] is not fully formed, and consists of multiple, somewhat irregularly shaped bones with no direct relationship to those of tetrapods. The upper jaw is formed from the [[pterygoid bone|pterygoid]]s and [[vomer]]s alone, all of which bear teeth. Much of the skull is formed from [[cartilage]], and its overall structure is reduced.<ref name=\"VB\" />\n\n====Tetrapods====\n[[File:Tiktaalik skull front.jpg|thumb|right|Skull of ''[[Tiktaalik]]'', an extinct genus transitional between [[lobe-finned fish]] and early tetrapods]]\nThe skulls of the earliest [[tetrapod]]s closely resembled those of their [[ancestor]]s amongst the [[lobe-finned fish]]es.

It is overlaying the [[endocranium]], corresponding to the cartilaginous skull in [[sharks]] and [[Batoidea|rays]]. The various separate bones that compose the [[temporal bone]] of humans are also part of the skull roof series. A further plate composed of four pairs of bones forms the roof of the mouth; these include the [[vomer]] and [[palatine bone]]s. The base of the cranium is formed from a ring of bones surrounding the [[foramen magnum]] and a median bone lying further forward; these are [[homology (biology)|homologous]] with the [[occipital bone]] and parts of the [[sphenoid bone|sphenoid]] in mammals. Finally, the lower jaw is composed of multiple bones, only the most anterior of which (the dentary) is homologous with the mammalian [[mandible]].<ref name=\"VB\">{{cite book |last1=Romer |first1=Alfred Sherwood |last2=Parsons |first2=Thomas S. |year=1977 |title=The Vertebrate Body |publisher=Holt-Saunders International |location= Philadelphia, PA |pages=216\u2013247 |isbn=0-03-910284-X}}</ref>\n\nIn living tetrapods, a great many of the original bones have either disappeared or fused into one another in various arrangements.\n\n===Birds===\n[[File:CuckooSkull.jpg|thumb|right|260px|Cuckoo skull]]\n[[Bird]]s have a [[diapsid]] skull, as in reptiles, with a prelachrymal fossa (present in some reptiles).

This characteristic is also seen in reptiles.\n{{Clear}}\n\n===Amphibians===\n[[File:AmphibSkeletons.png|thumb|right|Amphibians skulls, Hans Gadow, 1909 Amphibia and Reptiles]]\nLiving [[amphibian]]s typically have greatly reduced skulls, with many of the bones either absent or wholly or partly replaced by cartilage.<ref name=\"VB\" /> In mammals and birds, in particular, modifications of the skull occurred to allow for the expansion of the brain.

Depending on the lineage of a given animal, two, one, or no pairs of temporal fenestrae may be present, above or below the [[postorbital]] and [[squamosal]] bones. The upper temporal fenestrae are also known as the supratemporal fenestrae, and the lower temporal fenestrae are also known as the [[infratemporal fenestra]]e. The presence and morphology of the temporal fenestra are critical for taxonomic classification of the synapsids, of which mammals are part.\n\nPhysiological speculation associates it with a rise in metabolic rates and an increase in jaw musculature. The earlier amniotes of the Carboniferous did not have temporal fenestrae but two more advanced lines did: the [[synapsid]]s (mammal-like reptiles) and the [[diapsid]]s (most reptiles and later birds). As time progressed, diapsids' and synapsids' temporal fenestrae became more modified and larger to make stronger bites and more jaw muscles. Dinosaurs, which are diapsids, have large advanced openings, and their descendants, the birds, have temporal fenestrae which have been modified. Mammals, which are synapsids, possess one fenestral opening in the skull, situated to the rear of the orbit.\n\n====Classification====\n[[File:Chimpanzee skull.jpg|thumb|right|Chimpanzee skull|258x258px]]\n[[File:Goat skull-FMVZ USP-18.jpeg|thumb|Goat skull.]]\nThere are four types of amniote skull, classified by the number and location of their temporal fenestrae.
