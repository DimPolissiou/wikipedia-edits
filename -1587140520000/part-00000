The film is number 56th on the list of the American Film Institute's \"100 Funniest American Movies\".<ref>http://afi.com/100Years/laughs.aspx</ref>\n\n==Plot==\n[[Larry Talbot|Lawrence Talbot]] ([[Lon Chaney Jr.]]) makes an urgent phone call from London to a Florida railway station where Chick Young ([[Bud Abbott]]) and Wilbur Grey ([[Lou Costello]]) work as baggage clerks. Talbot tries to impart to Wilbur the danger of a shipment due to arrive for \"McDougal's House Of Horrors\", a local [[wax museum]]. The crates purportedly contain the remains of [[Count Dracula]] ([[B\u00e9la Lugosi]]) and the [[Frankenstein's monster#Appearance|Frankenstein monster]] ([[Glenn Strange]]). However, before Wilbur can understand, a [[The Wolf Man (1941 film)#Sequels|full moon rises]] and Talbot transforms into a [[werewolf]]. He proceeds to destroy his hotel room while Wilbur is on the line. Wilbur thinks the call is a prank and hangs up. Meanwhile, the museum owner, McDougal ([[Frank Ferguson]]), has arrived to claim the shipments. When Wilbur badly mishandles the crates, McDougal demands that the boys deliver them to his museum so his insurance agent can inspect them.\n\nChick and Wilbur deliver the crates after hours. They open the first one and find Dracula's coffin. When Chick leaves the room to retrieve the second crate, Wilbur reads aloud the Dracula legend printed on an exhibit card. The coffin slowly creaks open. Wilbur is so frightened that his attempts to call Chick result in helpless sputtering. Before Chick returns with the second crate, Dracula climbs unnoticed out of his coffin and hides in the shadows. Wilbur claims that the coffin opened, but Chick shows him that it is in fact empty. While the boys open the second crate containing the Monster, Chick leaves the room to greet McDougal and the insurance agent. Dracula now hypnotizes Wilbur and reanimates the Monster. They both leave and by the time McDougal, the insurance agent, and Chick enter, both crates are empty. McDougal accuses the boys of theft and has them arrested.\n\nThat night, Dr. Sandra Mornay ([[Lenore Aubert]]) welcomes Dracula and the Monster to her island castle. Sandra, a gifted surgeon who has studied Dr. Frankenstein's notebooks, has seduced Wilbur as part of Dracula's plan to replace the Monster's brutish brain with a more pliable one\u2014Wilbur's.\n\nWilbur and Chick are bailed out of jail. They assume that Sandra posted bond, but Joan Raymond ([[Jane Randolph]]), an undercover investigator for the insurance company, did so. Joan also feigns love for Wilbur, hoping that he will lead her to the missing \"exhibits\". Wilbur invites Joan to a [[masquerade ball]] that evening. Meanwhile, Lawrence Talbot has tracked Dracula and the Monster from Europe and has taken the apartment across the hall from Wilbur and Chick. Talbot asks Chick and Wilbur to help him find and destroy Dracula and the Monster. Wilbur believes, but Chick remains skeptical.\n\nThat night Wilbur, Chick and Joan go to Sandra's castle to pick her up for the ball. Wilbur answers a telephone call from Talbot, who informs them that they are in fact in the \"House of Dracula\". Wilbur reluctantly agrees to search the castle with Chick and soon stumbles upon a basement staircase that leads to a boat and dock. Chick insists they search for Dracula and the Monster to prove to Wilbur that they do not really exist. Behind a revolving door, Wilbur experiences a few close calls with the monsters; whenever he tries to get Chick's attention, the monsters have disappeared. Meanwhile, Joan discovers Dr. Frankenstein's notebook in Sandra's desk and Sandra finds Joan's insurance company employee ID in her purse.\n\nAs the men and women prepare to leave for the ball, a suavely dressed Dr. Lejos (a.k.a. Dracula) introduces himself to Joan and the boys. Also working at the castle is the naive Prof. Stevens (Charles Bradstreet), who questions some of the specialized equipment that has arrived. After Wilbur admits that he was in the basement, Sandra feigns a headache and tells Wilbur and the others that they will have to go to the ball without her. In private, Sandra admits to Dracula that Stevens' suspicions, Joan's credentials, and Wilbur's snooping in the basement have made her nervous enough to put the experiment on hold. Dracula asserts his will by hypnotizing her and biting her in the neck (in a continuity error, Dracula's reflection is visible in a mirror. Vampires do not have reflections, as stated in ''Dracula'' (1931)).\n\nEveryone is now at the masquerade ball. Talbot arrives and confronts Dr. Lejos, who is in costume as Dracula. Lejos easily deflects Talbot's accusations and takes Joan to the dance floor. Sandra lures Wilbur to a quiet spot in the woods and attempts to bite him, but Chick and Larry approach and she flees. While Talbot, Chick and Wilbur search for Joan, Talbot transforms into the Wolf Man and stalks Wilbur. Wilbur escapes, but the Wolf Man attacks McDougal, who is also at the ball. Since Chick's costume includes a wolf mask, McDougal accuses Chick of attacking him out of revenge. Chick escapes and witnesses Dracula hypnotizing Wilbur. Chick is also hypnotized and rendered helpless, while Dracula and Sandra bring Wilbur and Joan back to the castle. The next morning, Chick and Talbot, both fugitives, meet up in the bayou. Talbot confesses to Chick that he is indeed the Wolf Man. Chick explains that Dracula has taken Wilbur and Joan to the island and they agree to work together to rescue them.\n\nWilbur is held in a [[pillory]] in the cellar. Sandra explains her plan to transplant his brain into the Monster. When she and Dracula leave him to prepare the Monster for the operation, Chick and Talbot sneak in to set Wilbur and Stevens free. Dracula and Sandra return to the cellar and find Wilbur missing; Dracula easily recalls Wilbur and he soon finds himself strapped to an operating table in the lab. The Monster is on an adjacent table, receiving electric shocks. As Sandra brings a scalpel to Wilbur's forehead, Talbot and Chick burst in. Talbot pulls Sandra away from Wilbur and Chick unintentionally knocks her out while fending off Dracula with a chair. Chick flees the lab, pursued by Dracula. Talbot is about to untie Wilbur when he once again transforms into the Wolf Man. Dracula returns to the lab and engages in a brief tug of war with the Wolf Man over Wilbur's gurney. Dracula flees and the Wolf Man gives chase. Chick returns to untie Wilbur just as the Monster, now at full power, breaks his restraints and climbs off his gurney. Sandra attempts to command him, but the Monster picks her up and tosses her out the lab window to her death. Chick and Wilbur escape the lab and run from room to room with the Monster following them.\n\nDracula, while fighting with the Wolf Man, attempts to escape by transforming into a bat. The Wolf Man leaps, catches the bat and tumbles off a balcony onto the rocks below. Presumably, both are killed. Joan abruptly wakes from her trance and is rescued by Stevens. The boys run out of the castle to the pier, with the Monster still in pursuit. They climb into a small rowboat, while Stevens and Joan arrive and set the pier ablaze. The Monster wheels around into the flames (another continuity error, as the Monster is infamously afraid of fire and would not have walked into it), succumbing as the pier collapses into the water.\n\nWilbur scolds Chick for not believing him. Chick insists that now that all of the monsters are dead, \"there's nobody to frighten us anymore.\" They suddenly hear a disembodied voice (provided by an uncredited [[Vincent Price]]) and see a cigarette floating in the air. The voice says, \"Oh, that's too bad. I was hoping to get in on the excitement. Allow me to introduce myself\u2014I'm [[the Invisible Man]]!\" The boys jump out of the boat and swim away while the Invisible Man laughs.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Bud Abbott]] as Chick Young\n* [[Lou Costello]] as Wilbur Grey\n* [[Lon Chaney Jr.]] as [[Larry Talbot|Lawrence \"Larry\" Talbot / the Wolf Man]]\n* [[B\u00e9la Lugosi]] as [[Count Dracula]], masquerading under the guise of Dr. Lejos\n* [[Glenn Strange]] as [[Frankenstein's monster]]\n* [[Lenore Aubert]] as Dr. Sandra Mornay\n* [[Jane Randolph]] as Joan Raymond\n* [[Frank Ferguson]] as Mr. McDougal\n* Charles Bradstreet as Professor Stevens\n* [[Vincent Price]] as the voice of the [[The Invisible Man|Invisible Man]] (uncredited cameo)\n\n==Production==\n{{rewrite section|date=May 2018}}\n* The film was originally titled '''''The Brain of Frankenstein''''', but the title was changed during filming to appear like less of a straight horror film and capitalize on Abbott and Costello's marquee value.<ref name=Furmanek>Furmanek, Bob; Palumbo, Ron (1991).

Lugosi|Bela Lugosi Jr.]] states that the studio hired additional comedians to add laughs between takes on the set. This is incorrect; one comedian, Bobby Barber, sufficed.\n* Costello hated the script. He said that his five-year-old daughter could have written something better, but later warmed to the film during production.<ref name=\"Furmanek\"/>\n* During filming, Glenn Strange found Costello so funny he would often break up laughing, necessitating many retakes (this is readily apparent in the scene where Costello sits on the Monster's lap). There were several pie fights and other horseplay between takes as well, but Abbott and Costello respected the three monsters and made sure no pies or seltzer hit the heavily made-up actors.{{Citation needed|date=August 2019}}\n* No indication has been found suggesting [[Boris Karloff]] was ever approached to appear in this film{{Citation needed|date=August 2019}}, although he did help promote the film and can be seen in several publicity photos, including one where he points at a poster outside a New York theater.  His alleged comment (\"As long as I don't have to see it!\") has been used to imply he either disliked Abbott and Costello, or was aghast at playing the Monster for laughs.  In fact, he had done the latter a year before in ''[[The Secret Life of Walter Mitty (1947 film)|The Secret Life of Walter Mitty]]'', though the segment was excised.  And Karloff appeared with the duo in ''[[Abbott and Costello Meet the Killer, Boris Karloff]]'' (1949), and in ''[[Abbott and Costello Meet Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde]]'' (1953).\n* When the Monster throws Sandra through the lab window, Glenn Strange stepped on a camera cable and fractured his ankle. Lon Chaney Jr., who had previously played the Monster in ''[[The Ghost of Frankenstein]]'', took over the role of the Monster for that brief scene. A stuntman doubled for Strange in some long shots of the fire scenes on the pier.<ref name=Glut>[[Donald F. Glut|Glut, Donald F.]] (1973).

Dracula) introduces himself to Joan and the boys. Also working at the castle is the naive Prof. Stevens (Charles Bradstreet), who questions some of the specialized equipment that has arrived. After Wilbur admits that he was in the basement, Sandra feigns a headache and tells Wilbur and the others that they will have to go to the ball without her. In private, Sandra admits to Dracula that Stevens' suspicions, Joan's credentials, and Wilbur's snooping in the basement have made her nervous enough to put the experiment on hold. Dracula asserts his will by hypnotizing her and biting her in the neck (in a continuity error, Dracula's reflection is visible in a mirror. Vampires do not have reflections, as stated in ''Dracula'' (1931)).\n\nEveryone is now at the masquerade ball. Talbot arrives and confronts Dr. Lejos, who is in costume as Dracula. Lejos easily deflects Talbot's accusations and takes Joan to the dance floor. Sandra lures Wilbur to a quiet spot in the woods and attempts to bite him, but Chick and Larry approach and she flees. While Talbot, Chick and Wilbur search for Joan, Talbot transforms into the Wolf Man and stalks Wilbur. Wilbur escapes, but the Wolf Man attacks McDougal, who is also at the ball. Since Chick's costume includes a wolf mask, McDougal accuses Chick of attacking him out of revenge. Chick escapes and witnesses Dracula hypnotizing Wilbur. Chick is also hypnotized and rendered helpless, while Dracula and Sandra bring Wilbur and Joan back to the castle. The next morning, Chick and Talbot, both fugitives, meet up in the bayou. Talbot confesses to Chick that he is indeed the Wolf Man. Chick explains that Dracula has taken Wilbur and Joan to the island and they agree to work together to rescue them.\n\nWilbur is held in a [[pillory]] in the cellar. Sandra explains her plan to transplant his brain into the Monster. When she and Dracula leave him to prepare the Monster for the operation, Chick and Talbot sneak in to set Wilbur and Stevens free. Dracula and Sandra return to the cellar and find Wilbur missing; Dracula easily recalls Wilbur and he soon finds himself strapped to an operating table in the lab. The Monster is on an adjacent table, receiving electric shocks. As Sandra brings a scalpel to Wilbur's forehead, Talbot and Chick burst in. Talbot pulls Sandra away from Wilbur and Chick unintentionally knocks her out while fending off Dracula with a chair. Chick flees the lab, pursued by Dracula. Talbot is about to untie Wilbur when he once again transforms into the Wolf Man. Dracula returns to the lab and engages in a brief tug of war with the Wolf Man over Wilbur's gurney. Dracula flees and the Wolf Man gives chase. Chick returns to untie Wilbur just as the Monster, now at full power, breaks his restraints and climbs off his gurney. Sandra attempts to command him, but the Monster picks her up and tosses her out the lab window to her death. Chick and Wilbur escape the lab and run from room to room with the Monster following them.\n\nDracula, while fighting with the Wolf Man, attempts to escape by transforming into a bat. The Wolf Man leaps, catches the bat and tumbles off a balcony onto the rocks below. Presumably, both are killed. Joan abruptly wakes from her trance and is rescued by Stevens. The boys run out of the castle to the pier, with the Monster still in pursuit. They climb into a small rowboat, while Stevens and Joan arrive and set the pier ablaze. The Monster wheels around into the flames (another continuity error, as the Monster is infamously afraid of fire and would not have walked into it), succumbing as the pier collapses into the water.\n\nWilbur scolds Chick for not believing him. Chick insists that now that all of the monsters are dead, \"there's nobody to frighten us anymore.\" They suddenly hear a disembodied voice (provided by an uncredited [[Vincent Price]]) and see a cigarette floating in the air. The voice says, \"Oh, that's too bad. I was hoping to get in on the excitement. Allow me to introduce myself\u2014I'm [[the Invisible Man]]!\" The boys jump out of the boat and swim away while the Invisible Man laughs.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Bud Abbott]] as Chick Young\n* [[Lou Costello]] as Wilbur Grey\n* [[Lon Chaney Jr.]] as [[Larry Talbot|Lawrence \"Larry\" Talbot / the Wolf Man]]\n* [[B\u00e9la Lugosi]] as [[Count Dracula]], masquerading under the guise of Dr. Lejos\n* [[Glenn Strange]] as [[Frankenstein's monster]]\n* [[Lenore Aubert]] as Dr. Sandra Mornay\n* [[Jane Randolph]] as Joan Raymond\n* [[Frank Ferguson]] as Mr. McDougal\n* Charles Bradstreet as Professor Stevens\n* [[Vincent Price]] as the voice of the [[The Invisible Man|Invisible Man]] (uncredited cameo)\n\n==Production==\n{{rewrite section|date=May 2018}}\n* The film was originally titled '''''The Brain of Frankenstein''''', but the title was changed during filming to appear like less of a straight horror film and capitalize on Abbott and Costello's marquee value.<ref name=Furmanek>Furmanek, Bob; Palumbo, Ron (1991).

Lugosi|Bela Lugosi Jr.]] states that the studio hired additional comedians to add laughs between takes on the set. This is incorrect; one comedian, Bobby Barber, sufficed.\n* Costello hated the script. He said that his five-year-old daughter could have written something better, but later warmed to the film during production.<ref name=\"Furmanek\"/>\n* During filming, Glenn Strange found Costello so funny he would often break up laughing, necessitating many retakes (this is readily apparent in the scene where Costello sits on the Monster's lap). There were several pie fights and other horseplay between takes as well, but Abbott and Costello respected the three monsters and made sure no pies or seltzer hit the heavily made-up actors.{{Citation needed|date=August 2019}}\n* No indication has been found suggesting [[Boris Karloff]] was ever approached to appear in this film{{Citation needed|date=August 2019}}, although he did help promote the film and can be seen in several publicity photos, including one where he points at a poster outside a New York theater.  His alleged comment (\"As long as I don't have to see it!\") has been used to imply he either disliked Abbott and Costello, or was aghast at playing the Monster for laughs.  In fact, he had done the latter a year before in ''[[The Secret Life of Walter Mitty (1947 film)|The Secret Life of Walter Mitty]]'', though the segment was excised.  And Karloff appeared with the duo in ''[[Abbott and Costello Meet the Killer, Boris Karloff]]'' (1949), and in ''[[Abbott and Costello Meet Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde]]'' (1953).\n* When the Monster throws Sandra through the lab window, Glenn Strange stepped on a camera cable and fractured his ankle. Lon Chaney Jr., who had previously played the Monster in ''[[The Ghost of Frankenstein]]'', took over the role of the Monster for that brief scene. A stuntman doubled for Strange in some long shots of the fire scenes on the pier.<ref name=Glut>[[Donald F. Glut|Glut, Donald F.]] (1973).
