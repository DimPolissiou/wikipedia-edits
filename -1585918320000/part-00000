However, few jobs remained outside what remained of the coal industry. Most women were housewives, and boys were desperate to reach the age of fourteen, when they could start working in the mines. In the early 20th century, trams provided a new means of transport between [[Nottingham]], [[Ripley, Derbyshire|Ripley]] and [[Heanor]]. Lawrence lived next to the line, and described it as the most dangerous tram service in England.{{Citation needed|date=June 2009}}\n\nEastwood coal, metal castings, rope, wire and agricultural products made valuable contributions to Britain's war effort during the two [[world war]]s. In the [[Second World War]], Eastwood supplied soldiers to the [[Sherwood Foresters|Sherwood Foresters Regiment]]. A memorial on Nottingham Road commemorates Eastwood residents who gave their lives in both world wars.<ref name=plumb/>\n\nIn 1946, the coal industry was [[Nationalization|nationalised]], and the new [[National Coal Board]] acquired Eastwood Hall as their Area Office. This later became their National Office, and was the location for several crisis meetings during the national [[UK miners' strike (1984\u20131985)|Miners' Strike]] of the 1980s.

Industrialisation continued with the opening in 1868 of Moorgreen [[wikt:colliery|Colliery]], and in 1875 the demand for coal resulted in a railway station in Eastwood, with services to Nottingham on the [[Great Northern Railway (Great Britain)|Great Northern Railway]].<ref name=moorgreen>{{Cite journal\n |date         = 24 November 1945\n |title        = Tourism, Arts & Leisure \u2013 Colliers Wood\n |publisher    = Broxtowe Borough Council\n |url          = http://www.broxtowe.gov.uk/index.aspx?articleid=2256\n |accessdate   = 1 May 2008\n |archive-url  = https://web.archive.org/web/20110609184050/http://www.broxtowe.gov.uk/index.aspx?articleid=2256\n |archive-date = 9 June 2011\n |url-status     = dead\n |df           = dmy-all\n}}</ref>\n\n[[D. H. Lawrence]] was born in Eastwood in 1885.  Although the local area is mentioned in many of his novels, it is especially featured in ''[[The White Peacock]]'', against a backdrop of industrialisation. There were ten coal mines, or \"pits\", within easy walking distance of Lawrence's home, and the overwhelming majority of the local male population were [[wikt:collier|colliers]].<ref name=\"myvillage\">{{Cite journal\n | year = 1997\n | title = Biography of DH Lawrence\n | last = Worthen\n | first = John\n | publisher = D.H.

However, few jobs remained outside what remained of the coal industry. Most women were housewives, and boys were desperate to reach the age of fourteen, when they could start working in the mines. In the early 20th century, trams provided a new means of transport between [[Nottingham]], [[Ripley, Derbyshire|Ripley]] and [[Heanor]]. Lawrence lived next to the line, and described it as the most dangerous tram service in England.{{Citation needed|date=June 2009}}\n\nEastwood coal, metal castings, rope, wire and agricultural products made valuable contributions to Britain's war effort during the two [[world war]]s. In the [[Second World War]], Eastwood supplied soldiers to the [[Sherwood Foresters|Sherwood Foresters Regiment]]. A memorial on Nottingham Road commemorates Eastwood residents who gave their lives in both world wars.<ref name=plumb/>\n\nIn 1946, the coal industry was [[Nationalization|nationalised]], and the new [[National Coal Board]] acquired Eastwood Hall as their Area Office. This later became their National Office, and was the location for several crisis meetings during the national [[UK miners' strike (1984\u20131985)|Miners' Strike]] of the 1980s. At the height of its production in 1963, Moorgreen Colliery alone produced one million tons of coal, but the last coal mine in the area closed in 1985.<ref name=moorgreen/>\n\nIn recent years, tourism has become increasingly important. [[D.H. Lawrence Birthplace Museum|Lawrence's birthplace is now a museum]], and a painted line on the pavement, called the \"Blue Line Trail,\" guides visitors around eleven sites of local interest including three of Lawrence's homes.

This road contains many shops, uphill to the east, it leads to the A610 to Nottingham, the [[M1 motorway]], and Giltbrook Retail Park, which is home to a large [[IKEA]] store, and various projected developments (see [[#Future plans|Future plans]]). At the western end of Eastwood is a [[Roundabout|gyratory system]], consisting of an ancient crossroads converted into a traffic island, around the Sun Inn [[public house]]. A large [[Morrisons]] supermarket is here, and roads lead from the gyratory system north to [[Brinsley]], west to [[Heanor]], and south through Church Street, the location of several listed buildings, into New Eastwood.\n\nThe town is still surrounded by farmed land, woods and fields, and just half a mile (1&nbsp;km) to the west, the River Erewash forms the boundary between Nottinghamshire and Derbyshire.

These adapters manage service and task communication between the host and target.<ref name=\"techtarget\" />  Typically a [[device driver]], linked to the [[operating system]], controls the host adapter itself.\n\nIn a typical [[parallel SCSI]] subsystem, each device has assigned to it a unique numerical ID.  As a rule, the host adapter appears as SCSI ID 7, which gives it the highest priority on the SCSI bus (priority descends as the SCSI ID descends; on a 16-bit or \"wide\" bus, ID 8 has the lowest priority, a feature that maintains compatibility with the priority scheme of the 8-bit or \"narrow\" bus).\n\nThe host adapter usually assumes the role of [[SCSI initiator]], in that it issues commands to other SCSI devices.\n\nA computer can contain more than one host adapter, which can greatly increase the number of SCSI devices available.\n\nMajor SCSI adapter manufacturers are [[Hewlett-Packard|HP]], [[ATTO Technology]], [[Promise Technology]], [[Adaptec]], and [[LSI Corporation]].  LSI, Adaptec, and ATTO offer PCIe SCSI adapters which fit in Apple Mac, on Intel PCs, and low-profile motherboards  which lack SCSI support due to the inclusion of SAS and/or SATA connectivity.\n\n==Fibre Channel==\nThe term ''host bus adapter'' (HBA) is often used to refer to a [[Fibre Channel]] interface card.

These adapters manage service and task communication between the host and target.<ref name=\"techtarget\" />  Typically a [[device driver]], linked to the [[operating system]], controls the host adapter itself.\n\nIn a typical [[parallel SCSI]] subsystem, each device has assigned to it a unique numerical ID.  As a rule, the host adapter appears as SCSI ID 7, which gives it the highest priority on the SCSI bus (priority descends as the SCSI ID descends; on a 16-bit or \"wide\" bus, ID 8 has the lowest priority, a feature that maintains compatibility with the priority scheme of the 8-bit or \"narrow\" bus).\n\nThe host adapter usually assumes the role of [[SCSI initiator]], in that it issues commands to other SCSI devices.\n\nA computer can contain more than one host adapter, which can greatly increase the number of SCSI devices available.\n\nMajor SCSI adapter manufacturers are [[Hewlett-Packard|HP]], [[ATTO Technology]], [[Promise Technology]], [[Adaptec]], and [[LSI Corporation]].  LSI, Adaptec, and ATTO offer PCIe SCSI adapters which fit in Apple Mac, on Intel PCs, and low-profile motherboards  which lack SCSI support due to the inclusion of SAS and/or SATA connectivity.\n\n==Fibre Channel==\nThe term ''host bus adapter'' (HBA) is often used to refer to a [[Fibre Channel]] interface card.

The missile may be used by the F-2's successor once the aircraft retires in the 2030's.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2019/03/24/national/japan-plans-develop-home-made-long-range-anti-ship-missile-counter-threat/#.XJeUcyhKhPY|title=Japan plans to develop home-made long-range anti-ship missile to counter threat|last=|first=|date=24 March 2019|website=The Japan Times|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=24 March 2019}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://mainichi.jp/english/articles/20190319/p2g/00m/0fp/064000c|title=Japan announces longer-range cruise missile development|last=|first=|date=19 March 2019|website=The Mainichi|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=24 March 2019}}</ref>\n\nIn December 2019, the Japanese Defense Ministry secured \uffe510.3 billion to upgrade the missile in the 2020 budget.<ref>[https://www.mod.go.jp/j/yosan/yosan_gaiyo/2020/yosan.pdf Defence Programs and Budget of Japan 2020(Japanese), page.15] - ,[[Ministry of Defense (Japan)]], 16 December 2019</ref> It is planned to extend the range without resizing.<ref>[https://www.mod.go.jp/j/approach/hyouka/seisaku/31/pdf/jizen_03_honbun.pdf Policy evaluation overview for ASM-3 (\u6539)(Japanese)] - ,[[Ministry of Defense (Japan)]], 4 September 2019</ref>\n\n==Variants==\n*ASM-3 Kai(\u6539) - An extended range version.\n\n==See also==\n{{aircontent|\n|related=\n*[[Type 80 Air-to-Ship Missile|ASM-1]]\n*[[Type 93 Air-to-Ship Missile|ASM-2]]\n|similar aircraft=\n|lists=\n*[[List of missiles]]\n|see also=\n*[[Missile designation]]\n}}\n\n* [[Type 80 Air-to-Ship Missile]]\n* [[Type 88 Surface-to-Ship Missile]]\n* [[Type 90 Ship-to-Ship Missile]]\n* [[Type 93 Air-to-Ship Missile]]\n\n'''<big>Comparable missiles</big>'''\n*[[AS-17 Krypton|Kh-31]]\n*[[P-270 Moskit|Kh-41]]\n*[[P-800 Oniks|Kh-61]]\n*[[YJ-91]]\n*[[YJ-12]]\n*[[Hsiung Feng III]]\n*ANS ([[anti navire supersonique]], cancelled French project)\n{{Commons category|JASDF ASM-3}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://www.mod.go.jp/j/approach/hyouka/seisaku/ Policy evaluation reports]\n{{Use dmy dates|date=June 2017}}\n\n[[Category:Anti-ship missiles of Japan]]\n[[Category:Anti-ship cruise missiles]]\n", "name_user": "Alistair1978", "label": "safe", "comment": "typo (viaWP:JWB)", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASM-3"}

Fletcher was the author of the Ninth Circuit's decision in ''Demers v. Austin'' (January 2014).

When Fletcher makes a decision, he looks at both the facts of the case and the legal reasoning behind his decision. Fletcher reported in an interview that \"Probably the most important thing, beyond the obvious need for legal education of judges, is the development of a culture of decision making.  By this I mean a judicial culture in which it is expected that judges will\u2014to the extent of their ability and to the extent human nature will permit\u2014state carefully, fully, and honestly the factual and legal bases for their decisions.  I make no claim that American judges always live up to that ideal.  We do not.

Fletcher noted that Cooper may have been innocent and was denied a fair trial. Fletcher also reasoned that Cooper may have been treated unfairly due to his race. He was joined by Judges [[Harry Pregerson]], [[Stephen Reinhardt]], [[Richard Paez]], and [[Johnnie B.

ABA also inhibits the division of cells in the [[vascular cambium]], adjusting to cold conditions in the winter by suspending primary and secondary growth.\n\nAbscisic acid is also produced in the [[root]]s in response to decreased soil [[water potential]] (which is associated with dry soil) and other situations in which the plant may be under stress. ABA then translocates to the leaves, where it rapidly alters the osmotic potential of stomatal guard cells, causing them to shrink and [[stomata]] to close. The ABA-induced stomatal closure reduces [[transpiration]] (evaporation of water out of the stomata), thus preventing further water loss from the leaves in times of low water availability. A close linear correlation was found between the ABA content of the leaves and their conductance (stomatal resistance) on a leaf area basis.<ref>{{Cite journal| doi = 10.1007/BF00034837|pmid=24425243|issn=0166-8595| volume = 18| issue = 3| pages = 327\u2013336| last = Steuer| first = Barbara|author2=Thomas Stuhlfauth |author3=Heinrich P.

There are also conflicting conclusions from different studies, where some claim that ABA is essential for pro-inflammatory responses whereas other show anti-inflammatory effects. Like with many natural substances with medical properties, ABA has become popular also in [[naturopathy]]. While ABA clearly has beneficial biological activities and many naturopathic remedies will contain high levels of ABA (such as [[wheatgrass]] juice, fruits and vegetables), some of the health claims made may be exaggerated or overly optimistic.
