However, construction only began in 2005, with commissioning of the complex finally taking place on 15 November 2009. The acquisition of its own terminal was a condition of Aeroflot's entry into the SkyTeam airline alliance, thus necessitating the construction. The main contractor for the build was a Turkish company Enka. Terminal D has 22 jetways and 11 remote stands. On November 15, 2009 at 9:15&nbsp;a.m., the first flight from Terminal D (the new official name of Sheremetyevo-3) departed for the southern resort city of Sochi. Despite this, Aeroflot took a number of months (due to unexpected administrative delays) to transfer all of its international flights from Terminal F to D (a full transfer was originally planned for February 2010).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.russia-ic.com/news/show/9575/|title=Transfer of international flights to the Sheremetyevo Terminal D delayed once more :: Russia-InfoCentre|publisher=|accessdate=2 June 2015}}</ref> Whilst previously Terminal D had remained a separate legal entity from the rest of Sheremetyevo Airport, in spring 2012, it became an integrated unit of \"Sheremetyevo International Airport\" JSC. As part of the deal, Aeroflot, VEB Bank, and VTB Bank, all of which had invested in the construction of Terminal D, became part shareholders in the airport as a whole. The basis for the architectural and artistic image of Terminal D is that of a giant [[swan]] with outstretched wings.\n[[File:SVO Terminal D inside 01.jpg|thumb|Interior of Terminal D]]\nThere is an official multi-storey parking at Terminal D connected with the main building by means of a pedestrian bridge. The parking size is about 4100 lots, however it has a relatively dense layout, so in most cases, it is difficult to get out of the car without hitting the neighbouring car.\n\nBetween 2014 and 2018, Terminal D used to be the only terminal at Sheremetyevo that was able to serve domestic flights. Even since new Terminal B was opened and commenced its services, Terminal D continues to operate non-Aeroflot domestic flights.\n\nOn October 28, 2018, Terminal D started handling all of Rossiya Airlines' Moscow-originating domestic flights and its international service to Indonesia.<ref name=\"RB2\">{{cite web|url=https://russiabusinesstoday.com/travel-and-tourism/sheremetyevo-will-now-be-handling-more-flights-for-rossiya-airlines/|title=Sheremetyevo Will Now Be Handling More Flights For Rossiya Airlines|publisher=Russia Business Today|accessdate=15 January 2019}}</ref>\n\n====Terminal E====\nTerminal E opened in 2010 as a capacity expansion project, connecting terminals D and F.<ref name=\"map\">{{cite web|url=http://www.svo.aero/en/map/|title=Official website \u2013 Airport Map|accessdate=31 July 2017|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100130065943/http://svo.aero/en/map/|archivedate=30 January 2010}}</ref> The terminal's construction has allowed for the development of terminals D and F, as well as the railway station, into a single south terminal complex. The terminals of this complex are connected by a number of pedestrian walkways with travelators, thus allowing for passengers to move freely between its constituent facilities. In December 2010, a new chapel dedicated to St. Nicholas opened on the second floor of Terminal E. The terminal is used for international flights, primarily by Aeroflot and its SkyTeam partners. Terminal E has 8 jetway equipped gates. The V-Express [[Transit hotel|Transit Hotel]] between security/passport check-ins provides short-term accommodations for passengers changing planes without having to present a visa for entering Russia. The hotel drew international attention in June 2013 when [[Edward Snowden]] checked into the hotel while seeking asylum.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://rt.com/news/snowden-us-airspace-flight-extradition-145/|title=Snowden's plane lands in Havana, NSA leaker not seen aboard|publisher=|accessdate=2 June 2015}}</ref>\n\n====Terminal F====\n[[File:Sheremetyevo F terminal (31867447248).jpg|thumb|Lobby of Terminal F]]\nOpened on May 6, 1980 for the Moscow Summer Olympics, Terminal F, previously Sheremetyevo-2, has 15 jetways and 21 remote aircraft stands. The terminal was designed to service 6 million passengers per year. Until the completion of the original Terminal C, it was the only terminal that serviced international flights. The design is a larger version of the one of [[Hannover-Langenhagen Airport]] by the same architects. A major reconstruction of the terminal and its interior space was completed by late 2009. For the convenience of passengers, the departures lounge and Duty Free zone were thoroughly modernised, whilst a number of partition walls were removed to create extra retail and lounge space.\n\nIt was announced that terminal F will be re-constructed after the construction of terminal C is completed.\n\n==== Terminal G ====\nIn November 2019 it was announced that a new Terminal G will also be built.

However, construction only began in 2005, with commissioning of the complex finally taking place on 15 November 2009. The acquisition of its own terminal was a condition of Aeroflot's entry into the SkyTeam airline alliance, thus necessitating the construction. The main contractor for the build was a Turkish company Enka. Terminal D has 22 jetways and 11 remote stands. On November 15, 2009 at 9:15&nbsp;a.m., the first flight from Terminal D (the new official name of Sheremetyevo-3) departed for the southern resort city of Sochi. Despite this, Aeroflot took a number of months (due to unexpected administrative delays) to transfer all of its international flights from Terminal F to D (a full transfer was originally planned for February 2010).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.russia-ic.com/news/show/9575/|title=Transfer of international flights to the Sheremetyevo Terminal D delayed once more :: Russia-InfoCentre|publisher=|accessdate=2 June 2015}}</ref> Whilst previously Terminal D had remained a separate legal entity from the rest of Sheremetyevo Airport, in spring 2012, it became an integrated unit of \"Sheremetyevo International Airport\" JSC. As part of the deal, Aeroflot, VEB Bank, and VTB Bank, all of which had invested in the construction of Terminal D, became part shareholders in the airport as a whole. The basis for the architectural and artistic image of Terminal D is that of a giant [[swan]] with outstretched wings.\n[[File:SVO Terminal D inside 01.jpg|thumb|Interior of Terminal D]]\nThere is an official multi-storey parking at Terminal D connected with the main building by means of a pedestrian bridge. The parking size is about 4100 lots, however it has a relatively dense layout, so in most cases, it is difficult to get out of the car without hitting the neighbouring car.\n\nBetween 2014 and 2018, Terminal D used to be the only terminal at Sheremetyevo that was able to serve domestic flights. Even since new Terminal B was opened and commenced its services, Terminal D continues to operate non-Aeroflot domestic flights.\n\nOn October 28, 2018, Terminal D started handling all of Rossiya Airlines' Moscow-originating domestic flights and its international service to Indonesia.<ref name=\"RB2\">{{cite web|url=https://russiabusinesstoday.com/travel-and-tourism/sheremetyevo-will-now-be-handling-more-flights-for-rossiya-airlines/|title=Sheremetyevo Will Now Be Handling More Flights For Rossiya Airlines|publisher=Russia Business Today|accessdate=15 January 2019}}</ref>\n\n====Terminal E====\nTerminal E opened in 2010 as a capacity expansion project, connecting terminals D and F.<ref name=\"map\">{{cite web|url=http://www.svo.aero/en/map/|title=Official website \u2013 Airport Map|accessdate=31 July 2017|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100130065943/http://svo.aero/en/map/|archivedate=30 January 2010}}</ref> The terminal's construction has allowed for the development of terminals D and F, as well as the railway station, into a single south terminal complex. The terminals of this complex are connected by a number of pedestrian walkways with travelators, thus allowing for passengers to move freely between its constituent facilities. In December 2010, a new chapel dedicated to St. Nicholas opened on the second floor of Terminal E. The terminal is used for international flights, primarily by Aeroflot and its SkyTeam partners. Terminal E has 8 jetway equipped gates. The V-Express [[Transit hotel|Transit Hotel]] between security/passport check-ins provides short-term accommodations for passengers changing planes without having to present a visa for entering Russia. The hotel drew international attention in June 2013 when [[Edward Snowden]] checked into the hotel while seeking asylum.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://rt.com/news/snowden-us-airspace-flight-extradition-145/|title=Snowden's plane lands in Havana, NSA leaker not seen aboard|publisher=|accessdate=2 June 2015}}</ref>\n\n====Terminal F====\n[[File:Sheremetyevo F terminal (31867447248).jpg|thumb|Lobby of Terminal F]]\nOpened on May 6, 1980 for the Moscow Summer Olympics, Terminal F, previously Sheremetyevo-2, has 15 jetways and 21 remote aircraft stands. The terminal was designed to service 6 million passengers per year. Until the completion of the original Terminal C, it was the only terminal that serviced international flights. The design is a larger version of the one of [[Hannover-Langenhagen Airport]] by the same architects. A major reconstruction of the terminal and its interior space was completed by late 2009. For the convenience of passengers, the departures lounge and Duty Free zone were thoroughly modernised, whilst a number of partition walls were removed to create extra retail and lounge space.\n\nIt was announced that terminal F will be re-constructed after the construction of terminal C is completed.\n\n==== Terminal G ====\nIn November 2019 it was announced, that a new Terminal G will also be built.

Beginning a career as a [[child actor]] at the age of three, she is best known for her role as Jennifer Keaton on the hit [[NBC]] series ''[[Family Ties]]'', as well as for her roles in numerous television films throughout the 1980s and early 1990s including ''The Cherokee Trail'', ''[[Crash Course (film)|Crash Course]]'', and ''Spunk: The Tonya Harding Story'' among others.\n\n==Early life==\nYothers was born in [[Whittier, California]]. Her father, Robert Yothers, was a [[television producer]]. She has three brothers, Jeffrey and Randy (twins), and Cory, who all acted in commercials as children.  Her brother, Cory appeared in numerous films and television shows throughout the early 1980s, often credited as \"Bumper\" Yothers.\n\n==Career==\nYothers began her acting career in [[television advertisement]]s at age three. Her first cinema role was in the 1981 [[television film]] ''The Cherokee Trail''. She also appeared in the 1982 feature film ''[[Shoot the Moon]]''. Her most famous role was as Jennifer Keaton, the younger daughter in the television comedy ''[[Family Ties]]'' from 1982 to 1989.  She also competed in the ''[[Battle of the Network Stars]]'' in December 1988.  When ''Family Ties'' ended, Yothers abandoned her blonde hair color and has mostly worn it black with the notable exception of a 1996 appearance on ''[[Married... with Children]]''.\n\nShe wrote the book ''Being Your Best: Tina Yothers's Guide for Girls'' and formed the band Jaded with her brother Cory. She provided the lead vocals while Cory played keyboard.  In 1998, Jaded released their self-titled CD, which was co-written by Cory Yothers, Michael Anderson, Tina Yothers and performed by Tina Yothers (lead vocals), Michael Anderson (guitars/vocals), Jerry France (guitars/vocals), Larry Rosales (drums), Mike Wilson (bass) and Phil Jordan from [[No Doubt]] on trumpet, along with a [[Disc jockey|DJ]]. Previously, Yothers sang a cover of [[The Raes]] song \"Baby I'm Back in Love Again\", which she would later record as a single, in a ''Family Ties'' episode \"Band on the Run\" (February 26, 1987).\n\nAfter a nine-year absence from acting, Yothers was given the lead role in ''Lovelace the Musical'', a 2004 stage show based on the life of former [[pornographic film]] star [[Linda Lovelace]].  She followed that up with a stint as a stock player in the Burt Reynolds Dinner Theater in Boca Raton, Florida from 2005 to 2007.\n\nShe also appeared as herself on a special TV child stars edition of ''[[The Weakest Link]]'' in 2001 where she was voted off in round 5.\n\nYothers appeared on the fourth season of the [[VH1]] [[reality television]] show ''[[Celebrity Fit Club (US TV series)|Celebrity Fit Club]]'', which began on August 6, 2006.  After Yothers's second pregnancy, she appeared on ''[[Celebrity Fit Club (American TV series)#Season 6 \u2013 2008: Boot Camp|Celebrity Fit Club: Boot Camp]]'' to try get back to her post-Fit Club weight. On January 17, 2012 she was featured on the [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] show ''[[Wife Swap (American TV series)#Celebrity Wife Swap|Celebrity Wife Swap]]'', where she traded places with [[Niecy Nash]] of ''[[Reno 911!]]''.\n\nIn February 2013, Yothers appeared on an episode of the [[TLC (TV network)|TLC]] series ''[[What Not to Wear (U.S. TV series)|What Not To Wear]]''.\n\n==Personal life==\nIn 2002, Yothers married an electrician, Robert Kaiser, who had a daughter from a previous marriage. Yothers has two other children, daughter Lillian Grace 'Lilly', born October 2005, and a son, Robert Jake born September 24, 2007.  The family resides in [[Ontario, California]].\n\n==Filmography==\n\n=== Film and television ===\n{|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size: 90%;\" border=\"2\" cellpadding=\"4\" background: #f9f9f9;\n|- align=\"center\"\n! style=\"background: #CCCCCC;\" | Year\n! style=\"background: #CCCCCC;\" | Title\n! style=\"background: #CCCCCC;\" | Role\n! style=\"background: #CCCCCC;\" | Notes\n|-\n|1981\n| ''[[Walt Disney anthology television series|The Wonderful World of Disney]]''\n| Peg Breydon\n| \"The Cherokee Trail\"\n|-\n| 1982\n| ''[[Shoot the Moon]]''\n| Molly Dunlap\n| Feature film\n|-\n| 1982\n| ''[[Father Murphy]]''\n| Beatrice\n| \"The Dream Day\"\n|-\n| 1982\u20131989\n| ''[[Family Ties]]''\n| Jennifer Keaton\n| 176 episodes\n|-\n| 1983\n| ''Your Place... or Mine''\n|\n| Television movie\n|-\n| 1984\n| ''[[Domestic Life (TV series)|Domestic Life]]''\n| Sally Dwyer\n| \"Harold in Love\", \"The Candidates\"\n|-\n| 1985\n| ''[[List of Family Ties episodes#Film .281985.29|Family Ties Vacation]]''\n| Jennifer Keaton\n| Television movie\n|-\n|1988\n| ''[[Crash Course (film)|Crash Course]]''\n| Alice Santini\n| Television movie\n|-\n|1988\n| ''[[Mickey's 60th Birthday]]''\n| Jennifer Keaton\n| Television special\n|-\n| 1990\n| ''Laker Girls''\n| Tracy\n| Television movie\n|-\n| 1990\n| ''[[Double Dare (Nickelodeon game show)|Family Double Dare]]''\n| Herself\n| Celebrity contestant\n|-\n| 1993\n| ''[[Tonya Harding|Spunk: The Tonya Harding Story]]''\n| [[Tonya Harding]]\n| Television movie\n|-\n| 1995\n| ''[[Perry Mason (TV film series)|A Perry Mason Mystery: The Case of the Jealous Jokester]]''\n| Claire Howard\n| Television movie\n|-\n| 1996\n| ''[[Married... with Children]]''\n| Herself\n| \"Kelly's Gotta Habit\"\n|-\n| 2001\n| ''[[The Weakest Link]]\n| Herself\n| Child TV stars special edition\n|-\n| 2006\n| ''[[Celebrity Fit Club (U.S. TV series)|Celebrity Fit Club]]''\n| Herself\n| Reality Television\n|-\n| 2006\n| ''[[Who Wants to Be a Millionaire (U.S. game show)|Who Wants to Be a Millionaire]]''\n| Herself\n| Reality Television\n|-\n| 2012\n| ''[[Wife Swap (U.S. TV series)|Celebrity Wife Swap]]''\n| Herself\n| Reality Television\n|-\n| 2013\n| ''[[What Not to Wear (U.S. TV series)|What Not to Wear]]''\n| Herself\n| Reality Television\n|-\n|}\n\n==Awards and nominations==\n{| border=\"2\" cellpadding=\"4\" cellspacing=\"0\" style=\"margin: 1em 1em 1em 0; background: #f9f9f9; border: 1px #aaa solid; border-collapse: collapse; font-size: 90%;\"\n|- bgcolor=\"#B0C4DE\" align=\"center\"\n! style=\"background-color: #BCBCBC\"|Year\n! style=\"background-color: #BCBCBC\"|Award\n! style=\"background-color: #BCBCBC\"|Result\n! style=\"background-color: #BCBCBC\"|Category\n! style=\"background-color: #BCBCBC\"|Series\n|-\n|1983\n|rowspan=4|[[Young Artist Award]]\n|rowspan=2|'''Nominated'''\n|Best Young Actress in a New Television Series\n|rowspan=4|''Family Ties''\n|-\n|1984\n|Best Young Actress in a Comedy Series\n|-style=\"background-color: #EAEAEA;\"\n|1985\n|'''Won'''\n|Best Young Supporting Actress in a Television Comedy Series\n|-\n|1989\n|'''Nominated'''\n|Best Young Actress - Starring in a Television Comedy Series\n|}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n\n* {{IMDb name|0001869}}\n* {{tcmdb name|id=211149|name=Tina Yothers}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Yothers, Tina}}\n[[Category:1973 births]]\n[[Category:Living people]]\n[[Category:Actresses from California]]\n[[Category:American child actresses]]\n[[Category:American self-help writers]]\n[[Category:American television actresses]]\n[[Category:American film actresses]]\n[[Category:American stage actresses]]\n[[Category:20th-century American actresses]]\n[[Category:Musicians from Whittier, California]]\n[[Category:Participants in American reality television series]]\n[[Category:Actors from Whittier, California]]\n[[Category:Writers from Whittier, California]]\n[[Category:Singers from California]]\n[[Category:21st-century American singers]]\n[[Category:21st-century American women singers]]\n", "name_user": "Danafranklin", "label": "safe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tina_Yothers"}

It connects [[Neighborhoods of Portland, Oregon#North|North Portland]], [[Downtown Portland, Oregon|Portland City Center]], and [[Portland State University]] (PSU). The line runs north\u2013south from the [[Portland Metropolitan Exposition Center|Portland Expo Center]] to the [[Rose Quarter]] along a {{convert|5.8|mi|km|1|adj=on}} segment, referred to as the '''Interstate MAX''', and northbound through downtown Portland along the [[Portland Transit Mall]] on 6th Avenue. It serves 17 stops between the {{stn|Expo Center}} and [[PSU South stations|PSU South/Southwest 6th and College]] stations; of these, seven stops occupy the median of [[Oregon Route 99W|North Interstate Avenue]], giving that segment its name. The Yellow Line runs for approximately 21 hours daily with a minimum [[headway]] of 15 minutes during most of the day.\n\nFollowing years of failed attempts to construct the [[MAX Light Rail#South\u2013North proposal|South\u2013North Line]] between [[Clackamas, Oregon|Clackamas]] and [[Vancouver, Washington]], Portland business leaders and local residents persuaded TriMet to build a light rail extension to North Portland in 1999. The line, which began construction in 2001, opened on May 1, 2004, four months ahead of schedule. From 2004 to 2009, the Yellow Line ran between Expo Center station in North Portland and the [[Library/Southwest 9th Avenue and Galleria/Southwest 10th Avenue stations|Library and Galleria stations]] in downtown Portland, sharing tracks within downtown with the [[MAX Blue Line|Blue Line]] and the [[MAX Red Line|Red Line]]. In 2009, TriMet rerouted it to the newly rebuilt Portland Transit Mall.\n\nSince 2015, the Yellow Line has operated as a northbound [[through train|through service]] of the [[MAX Orange Line|Orange Line]] from PSU South/Southwest 6th and College station, sharing its transit mall alignment with the [[MAX Green Line|Green Line]]. Conversely, most southbound Yellow Line trains, which had served the other half of the mall on 5th Avenue from 2009 to 2015, through operate into the Orange Line from [[Union Station/Northwest 6th & Hoyt and Union Station/Northwest 5th & Glisan stations|Union Station/Northwest 5th & Glisan Street station]] and terminate at [[Southeast Park Avenue station]] in [[Milwaukie, Oregon|Milwaukie]]. {{As of|September 2018}}, the Yellow Line is the fourth-busiest service in the MAX system, carrying an average of 13,170 weekday riders daily.\n\n==History==\n===Early proposals===\n{{See also|MAX Light Rail#South\u2013North proposal}}\n[[File:FREEWAY (ROUTE I-5) RUNS DIRECTLY THROUGH THIS ESTABLISHED RESIDENTIAL AREA OF NORTHEAST PORTLAND - NARA - 548092.jpg|thumb|upright|left|alt=refer to caption|An aerial view of Interstate 5 (near center) and Interstate Avenue (upper right) facing south, shown in 1973]]\n\nPortland city planners originally conceived the idea of a northside passenger rail service in 1988 as part of Portland's Central City and [[Albina District, Portland, Oregon|Albina]] Community plans.<ref>{{cite news |last=Oliver |first=Gordon |title=Economic planning outlined |newspaper=The Oregonian |date=July 12, 1988 |page=B6}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |last=Pickett |first=Nelson |title=Planning commission looks at Albina Community Plan |newspaper=The Oregonian |date=February 25, 1992 |page=B2}}</ref> These plans sought to extend light rail through North Portland across the [[Columbia River]] and into [[Vancouver, Washington|Vancouver]] in [[Washington (state)|Washington]] via a potential route on either [[Oregon Route 99W|North Interstate Avenue]], [[Interstate 5 (Oregon)|Interstate 5]] (I-5), or [[Oregon Route 99E|Northeast Martin Luther King Jr. Boulevard]] (formerly Northeast Union Avenue).<ref>{{cite news |last=Mayer |first=James |title=Planners seek economic niche for inner city; Bureau plans 3-years study of North, Northeast Portland, hoping to help revive area |newspaper=[[The Oregonian]] |date=May 15, 1989 |page=B2}}</ref> As members of the U.S. [[United States Senate Committee on Appropriations|Senate Committee on Appropriations]], Oregon Senator [[Mark Hatfield]] and Washington Senator [[Brock Adams]] combined these proposals with the Portland\u2013[[Oregon City, Oregon|Oregon City]] light rail plan, for which the committee appropriated $2&nbsp;million in September 1989.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Kohler |first1=Vince |last2=Stewart |first2=Bill |title=Light-rail proposals gain ground in Congress; senate panel approves transportation funding bill, aiding plans for new Oregon City, Vancouver lines |newspaper=The Oregonian |date=September 10, 1989 |page=C2}}</ref>\n\nPreliminary alignment studies to Washington's [[Clark County, Washington|Clark County]], including an additional proposal for a line between [[Vancouver Mall]] and [[Clackamas Town Center]] along [[Interstate 205 (Oregon\u2013Washington)|I-205]],<ref>{{cite news |last=Stewart |first=Bill |title=Clark County light-rail plans chugging along; more than $1&nbsp;million will be spent on studies on both sides of the river |newspaper=The Oregonian |date=September 24, 1989 |page=C2}}</ref> commenced shortly after.

It connects [[Neighborhoods of Portland, Oregon#North|North Portland]], [[Downtown Portland, Oregon|Portland City Center]], and [[Portland State University]] (PSU). The line runs north\u2013south from the [[Portland Metropolitan Exposition Center|Portland Expo Center]] to the [[Rose Quarter]] along a {{convert|5.8|mi|km|1|adj=on}} segment, referred to as the '''Interstate MAX''', and northbound through downtown Portland along the [[Portland Transit Mall]] on 6th Avenue. It serves 17 stops between the {{stn|Expo Center}} and [[PSU South stations|PSU South/Southwest 6th and College]] stations; of these, seven stops occupy the median of [[Oregon Route 99W|North Interstate Avenue]], giving that segment its name. The Yellow Line runs for approximately 21 hours daily with a minimum [[headway]] of 15 minutes during most of the day.\n\nFollowing years of failed attempts to construct the [[MAX Light Rail#South\u2013North proposal|South\u2013North Line]] between [[Clackamas, Oregon|Clackamas]] and [[Vancouver, Washington]], Portland business leaders and local residents persuaded TriMet to build a light rail extension to North Portland in 1999. The line, which began construction in 2001, opened on May 1, 2004, four months ahead of schedule. From 2004 to 2009, the Yellow Line ran between Expo Center station in North Portland and the [[Library/Southwest 9th Avenue and Galleria/Southwest 10th Avenue stations|Library and Galleria stations]] in downtown Portland, sharing tracks within downtown with the [[MAX Blue Line|Blue Line]] and the [[MAX Red Line|Red Line]]. In 2009, TriMet rerouted it to the newly rebuilt Portland Transit Mall.\n\nSince 2015, the Yellow Line has operated as a northbound [[through train|through service]] of the [[MAX Orange Line|Orange Line]] from PSU South/Southwest 6th and College station, sharing its transit mall alignment with the [[MAX Green Line|Green Line]]. Conversely, most southbound Yellow Line trains, which had served the other half of the mall on 5th Avenue from 2009 to 2015, through operate into the Orange Line from [[Union Station/Northwest 6th & Hoyt and Union Station/Northwest 5th & Glisan stations|Union Station/Northwest 5th & Glisan Street station]] and terminate at [[Southeast Park Avenue station]] in [[Milwaukie, Oregon|Milwaukie]]. {{As of|September 2018}}, the Yellow Line is the fourth-busiest service in the MAX system, carrying an average of 13,170 weekday riders daily.\n\n==History==\n===Early proposals===\n{{See also|MAX Light Rail#South\u2013North proposal}}\n[[File:FREEWAY (ROUTE I-5) RUNS DIRECTLY THROUGH THIS ESTABLISHED RESIDENTIAL AREA OF NORTHEAST PORTLAND - NARA - 548092.jpg|thumb|upright|left|alt=refer to caption|An aerial view of Interstate 5 (near center) and Interstate Avenue (upper right) facing south, shown in 1973]]\n\nPortland city planners originally conceived the idea of a northside passenger rail service in 1988 as part of Portland's Central City and [[Albina District, Portland, Oregon|Albina]] Community plans.<ref>{{cite news |last=Oliver |first=Gordon |title=Economic planning outlined |newspaper=The Oregonian |date=July 12, 1988 |page=B6}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |last=Pickett |first=Nelson |title=Planning commission looks at Albina Community Plan |newspaper=The Oregonian |date=February 25, 1992 |page=B2}}</ref> These plans sought to extend light rail through North Portland across the [[Columbia River]] and into [[Vancouver, Washington|Vancouver]] in [[Washington (state)|Washington]] via a potential route on either [[Oregon Route 99W|North Interstate Avenue]], [[Interstate 5 (Oregon)|Interstate 5]] (I-5), or [[Oregon Route 99E|Northeast Martin Luther King Jr. Boulevard]] (formerly Northeast Union Avenue).<ref>{{cite news |last=Mayer |first=James |title=Planners seek economic niche for inner city; Bureau plans 3-years study of North, Northeast Portland, hoping to help revive area |newspaper=[[The Oregonian]] |date=May 15, 1989 |page=B2}}</ref> As members of the U.S. [[United States Senate Committee on Appropriations|Senate Committee on Appropriations]], Oregon Senator [[Mark Hatfield]] and Washington Senator [[Brock Adams]] combined these proposals with the Portland\u2013[[Oregon City, Oregon|Oregon City]] light rail plan, for which the committee appropriated $2&nbsp;million in September 1989.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Kohler |first1=Vince |last2=Stewart |first2=Bill |title=Light-rail proposals gain ground in Congress; senate panel approves transportation funding bill, aiding plans for new Oregon City, Vancouver lines |newspaper=The Oregonian |date=September 10, 1989 |page=C2}}</ref>\n\nPreliminary alignment studies to Washington's [[Clark County, Washington|Clark County]], including an additional proposal for a line between [[Vancouver Mall]] and [[Clackamas Town Center]] along [[Interstate 205 (Oregon\u2013Washington)|I-205]],<ref>{{cite news |last=Stewart |first=Bill |title=Clark County light-rail plans chugging along; more than $1&nbsp;million will be spent on studies on both sides of the river |newspaper=The Oregonian |date=September 24, 1989 |page=C2}}</ref> commenced shortly after.

{"title_page": "International Chemistry Olympiad", "text_new": "The '''International Chemistry Olympiad''' ('''IChO''') is an annual academic competition for high school students. It is one of the [[International Science Olympiad]]s.\n\nThe first IChO was held in [[Prague]], [[Czechoslovakia]], in 1968. The event has been held every year since then, with the exception of 1971. The delegations that attended the first events were mostly countries of the former [[Eastern bloc]] and it was not until 1980, the 12th annual International Chemistry Olympiad, that the event was held outside of the bloc in [[Austria]].  Up to 4 students for each national team compete around July in both a theoretical and an experimental sections, with about half of the participants being awarded medals.<ref>Celebrating the Golden Jubilee of the International Chemistry Olympiad: Back to Where It All Began https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.jchemed.7b00640</ref>\n\n==Structure and rules==   \n[[File:IChO medal.jpg|thumb|An International Chemistry Olympiad medal for 29th IChO, held at [[Montreal]], [[Canada]].]]\n\nEach delegation consists of up to four students and two mentors (one of them is designated as the head of the delegation or \"head mentor\"). A delegation may also include a handful of guests and scientific observers. Students must be under the age of 20 and must not be enrolled as regular students in any post-secondary education institution. The International Information Center of the International Chemistry Olympiad is based in [[Bratislava]], [[Slovakia]].\n\nCountries who wish to participate in the IChO must send observers to two consecutive olympiads before their students can participate in the event. A total of 68 countries took part in the 38th IChO in 2006: 67 as participants and 1 as an observer. In 2017 more than 80 countries are expected to send students.\n\nThe competition consists of two examinations, a theoretical examination and a practical examination. Both have durations of up to 5 hours, and are held on separate days with the practical examination usually being before the theoretical examination. The theoretical examination has a value of 60 points and the practical examination has a value of 40 points. Each examination is evaluated independently from the other and the sum of the results of the examinations determines a participant's overall result. A scientific jury, which is installed by the host country, suggests the tasks. The international jury, which consists of the 2 mentors from each of the participating countries, discusses the competition tasks and translates them into the language of their students' preference.\n\nStudents receive the examinations translated into their languages of preference. It is the duty of the mentors to translate the examinations from English before they are given to the participants. After the examinations are held and evaluated by a committee appointed by the host country and before awards are presented, mentors discuss the evaluation of the exams with judges of the committee to assure fairness in their evaluation. Because the mentors review the examinations before they are given to participants, any communication between the mentors and the students is strictly forbidden prior to the completion of both exams, and the students are required to surrender any mobile phones and laptop computers to the organizer.\n\nThe syllabus of the competition contains subjects from several areas of [[chemistry]], including [[organic chemistry]], [[inorganic chemistry]], [[physical chemistry]], [[analytical chemistry]], [[biochemistry]], and [[spectroscopy]]. Though some of these subjects are included in most secondary school chemistry programs, for the most part, they are evaluated at a much deeper level and many may require a level of knowledge and understanding comparable to that of post-secondary education. In addition, the host country of each IChO issues a set of preparatory problems well in advance of the competition every year. These preparatory problems cover specific topics in considerable more depth than typical post-secondary education. Preparation for the International Chemistry Olympiad demands a high level of understanding and interest in chemistry and an outstanding ability to relate chemical subjects with one another as well as with the practical world.\n\n[[File:Medali Emas Kelvin.jpg|thumb|A gold medal from the 40th IChO]]\nAll participants are ranked based on their individual scores and no official team scores are given. Gold medals are awarded to approximately the top 10% of students, silver medals are awarded to approximately the next 20% of students, and bronze medals are awarded approximately to the next 30% of students. The exact number of medals is decided on the blind review of the results. Honorable mentions are awarded to the next top 10% of the participants that do not win a medal. One special award is given to the student that achieves the highest score overall.  Two separate special awards are given to the students who get the best score in the theoretical and practical examinations.\n\nThese events are also outstanding opportunities for the students to meet people from all around the world who share similar interests, to visit different places, and to get in touch with different cultures. As the aims of the competition establish, ''the IChO competitions help to enhance friendly relations among young people from different countries; they encourage cooperation and international understanding''.\n\n==Preparation==\nWhile each country is free to choose its team by whatever means it seems appropriate, the selection process usually involves holding regional and national olympiad competitions. Many countries hold \"training camps\" for its top students, where mentors from the country give the students accelerated college-level courses in chemistry with an emphasis on the topics covered in that year's preparatory problems as well as practical training. It is agreed that such training programs must not exceed a total duration of two weeks but there are allegations every year that some countries exceed this limit by months or even years. Another concern is that some countries tend to bring the same students to the competition year after year, which helps them win better medals. Although some believe that this is against the spirit of the olympiad, many nations find it hard to justify leaving their best students at home.\n\n==History==\nThe idea of the [https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.jchemed.7b00640 International Chemistry Olympiad was developed in the former Czechoslovakia in 1968]. It was designed with the aim to increase the number of international contacts and the exchange of information between nations. Invitations were sent by the Czechoslovak national committee to all [[Warsaw Pact]] countries, except Romania (due to political issues between Romania and USSR). However, in May 1968, relations between Czechoslovakia and the Soviet Union became so delicate that only Poland and Hungary participated in the first international competition.<ref name=history>{{cite web|url=http://www.icho39.chem.msu.ru/html/english/IChO/History.htm |title=39th INTERNATIONAL CHEMISTRY OLYMPIAD |publisher=Icho39.chem.msu.ru |date= |accessdate=2018-04-28}}</ref>\n\nThe first International Chemistry Olympiad took place in Prague between 18 and 21 June 1968. Each of the three participating countries sent a team of six students, and four theoretical tasks were to be solved. Guidelines for the next competitions were already suggested. The second chemistry Olympiad took place in 1969 in Poland, and Bulgaria also participated, with USSR and GDR only sending observers. Each team consisted of five pupils, and an experimental competition was added. The decision was made to invite more socialist countries to future competitions and to limit the number of pupils to four. The third Olympiad in 1970 was organized in Hungary with the GDR, Romania and the Soviet Union as new countries. In this competition, more than three prizes were distributed for the first time.<ref name=history/>\n\nThere was no Olympiad held in 1971, as at the end of the competition in 1970, an organizer and host for the next event could not be agreed on. This was solved for the next three years by diplomatically agreeing on the Soviet Union to host 1972, Bulgaria in 1973, and Romania in 1974, starting the tradition to decide the host years in advance. 1972 was the first time where preparation tasks for the International Chemistry Olympiad were created. Also, at a jury session, it was suggested that invitations should be sent to Vietnam, Mongolia, and Cuba. Unfortunately though, these invitations were not sent, leaving seven to compete in 1973.<ref name=history/>\n\nIn 1974, Romania invited Sweden and Yugoslavia to the Olympiad in Bucharest and Germany and Austria sent observers. The Federal Republic of Germany was the first NATO-country with an observer present and this was only able to occur because the Brandt government had contracts in the East. Thus, in 1975, West Germany, Austria, and Belgium also participated in the International Chemistry Olympiad.<ref name=history/>\n\nThe first Olympiad in a non-socialist country took place 1980 in Linz in Austria, although the Soviet Union did not participate. Since then the number of the participating countries has increased steadily. In 1980, only 13 nations took part but this number increased to 21 by the 1984 Olympiad in Frankfurt/Main. With [[revolutions of 1989|the fall of the Iron Curtain]] and the break-up of the Soviet Union into independent states in the early 1990s, the number of participants increased again. In addition, the increasing interest of Asian and Latin American countries became apparent with the numbers of participants. Altogether 47 delegations participated in 1998.  Presently, 75 countries participate in the International Chemistry Olympiad.<ref name=history/>\n\n==Summary== \n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"  text-align:center;\"\n|- style=\"background:#ccf;\"\n!

It is one of the [[International Science Olympiad]]s.\n\nThe first IChO was held in [[Prague]], [[Czechoslovakia]], in 1968. The event has been held every year since then, with the exception of 1971. The delegations that attended the first events were mostly countries of the former [[Eastern bloc]] and it was not until 1980, the 12th annual International Chemistry Olympiad, that the event was held outside of the bloc in [[Austria]].  Up to 4 students for each national team compete around July in both a theoretical and an experimental sections, with about half of the participants being awarded medals.<ref>Celebrating the Golden Jubilee of the International Chemistry Olympiad: Back to Where It All Began https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.jchemed.7b00640</ref>\n\n==Structure and rules==   \n[[File:IChO medal.jpg|thumb|An International Chemistry Olympiad medal for 29th IChO, held at [[Montreal]], [[Canada]].]]\n\nEach delegation consists of up to four students and two mentors (one of them is designated as the head of the delegation or \"head mentor\"). A delegation may also include a handful of guests and scientific observers. Students must be under the age of 20 and must not be enrolled as regular students in any post-secondary education institution. The International Information Center of the International Chemistry Olympiad is based in [[Bratislava]], [[Slovakia]].\n\nCountries who wish to participate in the IChO must send observers to two consecutive olympiads before their students can participate in the event. A total of 68 countries took part in the 38th IChO in 2006: 67 as participants and 1 as an observer. In 2017 more than 80 countries are expected to send students.\n\nThe competition consists of two examinations, a theoretical examination and a practical examination. Both have durations of up to 5 hours, and are held on separate days with the practical examination usually being before the theoretical examination. The theoretical examination has a value of 60 points and the practical examination has a value of 40 points. Each examination is evaluated independently from the other and the sum of the results of the examinations determines a participant's overall result. A scientific jury, which is installed by the host country, suggests the tasks. The international jury, which consists of the 2 mentors from each of the participating countries, discusses the competition tasks and translates them into the language of their students' preference.\n\nStudents receive the examinations translated into their languages of preference. It is the duty of the mentors to translate the examinations from English before they are given to the participants. After the examinations are held and evaluated by a committee appointed by the host country and before awards are presented, mentors discuss the evaluation of the exams with judges of the committee to assure fairness in their evaluation. Because the mentors review the examinations before they are given to participants, any communication between the mentors and the students is strictly forbidden prior to the completion of both exams, and the students are required to surrender any mobile phones and laptop computers to the organizer.\n\nThe syllabus of the competition contains subjects from several areas of [[chemistry]], including [[organic chemistry]], [[inorganic chemistry]], [[physical chemistry]], [[analytical chemistry]], [[biochemistry]], and [[spectroscopy]]. Though some of these subjects are included in most secondary school chemistry programs, for the most part, they are evaluated at a much deeper level and many may require a level of knowledge and understanding comparable to that of post-secondary education. In addition, the host country of each IChO issues a set of preparatory problems well in advance of the competition every year. These preparatory problems cover specific topics in considerable more depth than typical post-secondary education. Preparation for the International Chemistry Olympiad demands a high level of understanding and interest in chemistry and an outstanding ability to relate chemical subjects with one another as well as with the practical world.\n\n[[File:Medali Emas Kelvin.jpg|thumb|A gold medal from the 40th IChO]]\nAll participants are ranked based on their individual scores and no official team scores are given. Gold medals are awarded to approximately the top 10% of students, silver medals are awarded to approximately the next 20% of students, and bronze medals are awarded approximately to the next 30% of students. The exact number of medals is decided on the blind review of the results. Honorable mentions are awarded to the next top 10% of the participants that do not win a medal. One special award is given to the student that achieves the highest score overall.  Two separate special awards are given to the students who get the best score in the theoretical and practical examinations.\n\nThese events are also outstanding opportunities for the students to meet people from all around the world who share similar interests, to visit different places, and to get in touch with different cultures. As the aims of the competition establish, ''the IChO competitions help to enhance friendly relations among young people from different countries; they encourage cooperation and international understanding''.\n\n==Preparation==\nWhile each country is free to choose its team by whatever means it seems appropriate, the selection process usually involves holding regional and national olympiad competitions. Many countries hold \"training camps\" for its top students, where mentors from the country give the students accelerated college-level courses in chemistry with an emphasis on the topics covered in that year's preparatory problems as well as practical training. It is agreed that such training programs must not exceed a total duration of two weeks but there are allegations every year that some countries exceed this limit by months or even years. Another concern is that some countries tend to bring the same students to the competition year after year, which helps them win better medals. Although some believe that this is against the spirit of the olympiad, many nations find it hard to justify leaving their best students at home.\n\n==History==\nThe idea of the [https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.jchemed.7b00640 International Chemistry Olympiad was developed in the former Czechoslovakia in 1968]. It was designed with the aim to increase the number of international contacts and the exchange of information between nations. Invitations were sent by the Czechoslovak national committee to all [[Warsaw Pact]] countries, except Romania (due to political issues between Romania and USSR). However, in May 1968, relations between Czechoslovakia and the Soviet Union became so delicate that only Poland and Hungary participated in the first international competition.<ref name=history>{{cite web|url=http://www.icho39.chem.msu.ru/html/english/IChO/History.htm |title=39th INTERNATIONAL CHEMISTRY OLYMPIAD |publisher=Icho39.chem.msu.ru |date= |accessdate=2018-04-28}}</ref>\n\nThe first International Chemistry Olympiad took place in Prague between 18 and 21 June 1968. Each of the three participating countries sent a team of six students, and four theoretical tasks were to be solved. Guidelines for the next competitions were already suggested. The second chemistry Olympiad took place in 1969 in Poland, and Bulgaria also participated, with USSR and GDR only sending observers. Each team consisted of five pupils, and an experimental competition was added. The decision was made to invite more socialist countries to future competitions and to limit the number of pupils to four. The third Olympiad in 1970 was organized in Hungary with the GDR, Romania and the Soviet Union as new countries. In this competition, more than three prizes were distributed for the first time.<ref name=history/>\n\nThere was no Olympiad held in 1971, as at the end of the competition in 1970, an organizer and host for the next event could not be agreed on. This was solved for the next three years by diplomatically agreeing on the Soviet Union to host 1972, Bulgaria in 1973, and Romania in 1974, starting the tradition to decide the host years in advance. 1972 was the first time where preparation tasks for the International Chemistry Olympiad were created. Also, at a jury session, it was suggested that invitations should be sent to Vietnam, Mongolia, and Cuba. Unfortunately though, these invitations were not sent, leaving seven to compete in 1973.<ref name=history/>\n\nIn 1974, Romania invited Sweden and Yugoslavia to the Olympiad in Bucharest and Germany and Austria sent observers. The Federal Republic of Germany was the first NATO-country with an observer present and this was only able to occur because the Brandt government had contracts in the East. Thus, in 1975, West Germany, Austria, and Belgium also participated in the International Chemistry Olympiad.<ref name=history/>\n\nThe first Olympiad in a non-socialist country took place 1980 in Linz in Austria, although the Soviet Union did not participate. Since then the number of the participating countries has increased steadily. In 1980, only 13 nations took part but this number increased to 21 by the 1984 Olympiad in Frankfurt/Main. With [[revolutions of 1989|the fall of the Iron Curtain]] and the break-up of the Soviet Union into independent states in the early 1990s, the number of participants increased again. In addition, the increasing interest of Asian and Latin American countries became apparent with the numbers of participants. Altogether 47 delegations participated in 1998.  Presently, 75 countries participate in the International Chemistry Olympiad.<ref name=history/>\n\n==Summary== \n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"  text-align:center;\"\n|- style=\"background:#ccf;\"\n!

{"title_page": "IEEE 754", "text_new": "{{Use dmy dates|date=May 2019|cs1-dates=y}}\n\nThe '''IEEE Standard for Floating-Point Arithmetic''' ('''IEEE 754''') is a [[technical standard]]  for [[floating-point arithmetic]] established in 1985 by the [[Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers]] (IEEE). The standard [[Floating-point arithmetic#IEEE 754 design rationale|addressed many problems]] found in the diverse floating-point implementations that made them difficult to use reliably and [[Software portability|portably]]. Many hardware [[floating-point unit]]s use the IEEE 754 standard.\n\nThe standard defines:\n* ''arithmetic formats:'' sets of [[Binary code|binary]] and [[decimal]] floating-point data, which consist of finite numbers (including [[signed zero]]s and [[subnormal number]]s), [[infinity|infinities]], and special \"not a number\" values ([[NaN]]s)\n* ''interchange formats:'' encodings (bit strings) that may be used to exchange floating-point data in an efficient and compact form\n* ''rounding rules:'' properties to be satisfied when rounding numbers during arithmetic and conversions\n* ''operations:'' arithmetic and other operations (such as [[trigonometric functions]]) on arithmetic formats\n* ''exception handling:'' indications of exceptional conditions (such as [[division by zero]], overflow, ''etc.'')\n\n[[IEEE 754-2008 revision|IEEE 754-2008]], published in August 2008, includes nearly all of the original [[IEEE 754-1985]] standard, plus the [[IEEE 854-1987|IEEE 854-1987 Standard for Radix-Independent Floating-Point Arithmetic]].  {{anchor|2019}}The current version, IEEE 754-2019, was published in July 2019.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://standards.ieee.org/content/ieee-standards/en/standard/754-2019.html|title=IEEE 754-2019 - IEEE Standard for Floating-Point Arithmetic|website=standards.ieee.org|accessdate=23 July 2019}}</ref> It is a minor revision of the previous version, incorporating mainly clarifications, defect fixes and new recommended operations.\n\n==Standard development==\nThe first standard for floating-point arithmetic, [[IEEE 754-1985]], was published in 1985. It covered only binary floating-point arithmetic.\n\nA new version, [[IEEE 754-2008 revision|IEEE 754-2008]], was published in August 2008, following a seven-year revision process, chaired by Dan Zuras and edited by [[Mike Cowlishaw]]. It replaced both IEEE 754-1985 (binary floating-point arithmetic) and [[IEEE 854-1987|IEEE 854-1987 Standard for Radix-Independent Floating-Point Arithmetic]]. The binary formats in the original standard are included in this new standard along with three new basic formats, one binary and two decimal.  To conform to the current standard, an implementation must implement at least one of the basic formats as both an arithmetic format and an interchange format.\n\nThe international standard '''ISO/IEC/IEEE 60559:2011''' (with content identical to IEEE 754-2008) has been approved for adoption through [[ISO/IEC JTC1|JTC1]]/SC 25 under the ISO/IEEE PSDO Agreement<ref>{{cite web|url=http://grouper.ieee.org/groups/754/email/msg04167.html|title=FW: ISO/IEC/IEEE 60559 (IEEE Std 754-2008)|website=grouper.ieee.org|accessdate=4 April 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171027190846/http://grouper.ieee.org/groups/754/email/msg04167.html|archive-date=2017-10-27}}</ref> and published.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.iso.org/iso/iso_catalogue/catalogue_tc/catalogue_detail.htm?csnumber=57469|title=ISO/IEC/IEEE 60559:2011 - Information technology -- Microprocessor Systems -- Floating-Point arithmetic|website=www.iso.org|accessdate=4 April 2018}}</ref>\n\nThe current version, IEEE 754-2019 published in July 2019, is derived from and replaces IEEE 754-2008, following a revision process started in September 2015, chaired by David G.

A format may also include how the set is encoded.<ref>{{Harvnb|IEEE 754|2008|loc=\u00a72.1.27}}.</ref>\n\nA floating-point format is specified by:\n* a base (also called ''radix'') ''b'', which is either 2 (binary) or 10 (decimal) in IEEE 754;\n* a precision ''p'';\n* an exponent range from ''emin'' to ''emax'', with ''emin'' = 1 \u2212 ''emax'' for all IEEE 754 formats.\n\nA format comprises:\n* Finite numbers, which can be described by three integers: ''s''&nbsp;= a ''sign'' (zero or one), ''c''&nbsp;= a ''[[significand]]'' (or ''coefficient'') having no more than ''p'' digits when written in base ''b'' (i.e., an integer in the range through 0 to ''b''<sup>''p''</sup>&nbsp;\u2212&nbsp;1), and ''q''&nbsp;= an ''exponent'' such that ''emin'' \u2264 ''q''&nbsp;+&nbsp;''p''&nbsp;\u2212&nbsp;1 \u2264 ''emax''. The numerical value of such a finite number is {{nowrap|(\u22121)<sup>''s''</sup> \u00d7 ''c'' \u00d7 ''b''<sup>''q''</sup>}}.<ref group=\"lower-alpha\">For example, if the base is 10, the sign is 1 (indicating negative), the significand is 12345, and the exponent is \u22123, then the value of the number is {{nowrap|(\u22121)<sup>1</sup> \u00d7 12345 \u00d7 10<sup>\u22123</sup>}} = {{nowrap|\u22121 \u00d7 12345 \u00d7 0.001}} = \u221212.345.</ref> Moreover, there are two zero values, called [[signed zero]]s: the sign bit specifies whether a zero is +0 (positive zero) or \u22120 (negative zero).\n* Two infinities: +\u221e and \u2212\u221e.\n* Two kinds of [[NaN]] (not-a-number): a quiet NaN (qNaN) and a signaling NaN (sNaN).\n\nFor example, if ''b'' = 10, ''p'' = 7, and ''emax'' = 96, then ''emin'' = \u221295, the significand satisfies 0 \u2264 ''c'' \u2264 {{val|9999999}}, and the exponent satisfies \u2212101 \u2264 ''q'' \u2264 90. Consequently, the smallest non-zero positive number that can be represented is 1\u00d710<sup>\u2212101</sup>, and the largest is 9999999\u00d710<sup>90</sup> (9.999999\u00d710<sup>96</sup>), so the full range of numbers is \u22129.999999\u00d710<sup>96</sup> through 9.999999\u00d710<sup>96</sup>. The numbers \u2212''b''<sup>1\u2212''emax''</sup> and ''b''<sup>1\u2212''emax''</sup> (here, \u22121\u00d710<sup>\u221295</sup> and 1\u00d710<sup>\u221295</sup>) are the smallest (in magnitude) ''normal numbers''; non-zero numbers between these smallest numbers are called [[subnormal number]]s.\n\n=== Representation and encoding in memory ===\nSome numbers may have several possible exponential format representations. For instance, if ''b''\u00a0=\u00a010, and ''p''\u00a0=\u00a07, then \u221212.345 can be represented by \u221212345\u00d710<sup>\u22123</sup>, \u2212123450\u00d710<sup>\u22124</sup>, and \u22121234500\u00d710<sup>\u22125</sup>. However, for most operations, such as arithmetic operations, the result (value) does not depend on the representation of the inputs.\n\nFor the decimal formats, any representation is valid, and the set of these representations is called a ''cohort''. When a result can have several representations, the standard specifies which member of the cohort is chosen.\n\nFor the binary formats, the representation is made unique by choosing the smallest representable exponent allowing the value to be represented exactly. Further, the exponent is not represented directly, but a bias is added so that the smallest representable exponent is represented as 1, with 0 used for subnormal numbers. For numbers with an exponent in the normal range (the exponent field being not all ones or all zeros), the leading bit of the significand will always be 1. Consequently, a leading 1 can be implied rather than explicitly present in the memory encoding, and under the standard the explicitly represented part of the significand will lie between 0 and 1. This rule is called ''leading bit convention'', ''implicit bit convention'', or ''hidden bit convention''. This rule allows the binary format to have an extra bit of precision. The leading bit convention cannot be used for the subnormal numbers as they have an exponent outside the normal exponent range and scale by the smallest represented exponent as used for the smallest normal numbers.\n\nDue to the possibility of multiple encodings (at least in formats called ''interchange formats''), a NaN may carry other information: a sign bit (which has no meaning, but may be used by some operations) and a ''payload'', which is intended for diagnostic information indicating the source of the NaN (but the payload may have other uses, such as ''NaN-boxing''<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Projects/SpiderMonkey/Internals |title=SpiderMonkey Internals |website=developer.mozilla.org |accessdate=11 March 2018}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book |last1=Klemens |first1=Ben |title=21st Century C: C Tips from the New School |date=September 2014 |publisher=O'Reilly Media, Incorporated |page=160 |url=https://books.google.fr/books?id=ASuiBAAAQBAJ |accessdate=11 March 2018|isbn=9781491904442 }}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url=https://github.com/zuiderkwast/nanbox |title=zuiderkwast/nanbox: NaN-boxing in C |website=[[GitHub]] |accessdate=11 March 2018}}</ref>).\n\n=== Basic and interchange formats ===\n\nThe standard defines five basic formats that are named for their numeric base and the number of bits used in their interchange encoding. There are three binary floating-point basic formats (encoded with 32, 64 or 128 bits) and two decimal floating-point basic formats (encoded with 64 or 128 bits). The [[binary32]] and [[binary64]] formats are the ''single'' and ''double'' formats of [[IEEE 754-1985]] respectively. A conforming implementation must fully implement at least one of the basic formats.\n\nThe standard also defines ''[[#Interchange formats|interchange formats]]'', which generalize these basic formats.<ref>{{Harvnb|IEEE 754|2008|loc=\u00a73.6}}.</ref> For the binary formats, the leading bit convention is required. The following table summarizes the smallest interchange formats (including the basic ones).\n\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n! Name                                                   !! Common name        !!

For example, the smallest positive number that can be represented in binary64 is 2<sup>\u22121074</sup>; contributions to the \u22121074 figure include the E&nbsp;min value \u22121022 and all but one of the 53 significand bits (2<sup>\u22121022&nbsp;\u2212&nbsp;(53&nbsp;\u2212&nbsp;1)</sup>&nbsp;=&nbsp;2<sup>\u22121074</sup>).\n\nDecimal digits is ''digits'' \u00d7 log<sub>10</sub> ''base''. This gives an approximate precision in number of decimal digits.\n\nDecimal E max is ''Emax'' \u00d7 log<sub>10</sub> ''base''. This gives an approximate value of the maximum decimal exponent.\n\nThe binary32 (single) and binary64 (double) formats are two of the most common formats used today. The figure below shows the absolute precision for both formats over a range of values. This figure can be used to select an appropriate format given the expected value of a number and the required precision.\n\n[[File:IEEE754.svg|thumb|none|frame|550px|Precision of binary32 and binary64 in the range 10<sup>\u221212</sup> to 10<sup>12</sup>]]\n\n\nAn example of a layout for [[Single-precision floating-point format|32-bit floating point]] is\n[[File:Float example.svg|none]]\n \nand the [[Double-precision floating-point format|64 bit layout is similar]].\n\n=== Extended and extendable precision formats ===\nThe standard specifies optional [[Extended precision|extended]] and extendable precision formats, which provide greater precision than the basic formats.<ref>{{Harvnb|IEEE 754|2008|loc=\u00a73.7}}.</ref> An extended precision format extends a basic format by using more precision and more exponent range. An extendable precision format allows the user to specify the precision and exponent range. An implementation may use whatever internal representation it chooses for such formats; all that needs to be defined are its parameters (''b'', ''p'', and ''emax''). These parameters uniquely describe the set of finite numbers (combinations of sign, significand, and exponent for the given radix) that it can represent.\n\nThe standard recommends that language standards provide a method of specifying ''p'' and ''emax'' for each supported base ''b''.<ref>{{Harvnb|IEEE 754|2008|loc=\u00a73.7}} states: \"Language standards should define mechanisms supporting extendable precision for each supported radix.\"</ref><!-- extendable recommendation does not apply to \"implementations\". --> The standard recommends that language standards and implementations support an extended format which has a greater precision than the largest basic format supported for each radix ''b''.<ref>{{Harvnb|IEEE 754|2008|loc=\u00a73.7}} states: \"Language standards or implementations should support an extended precision format that extends the widest basic format that is supported in that radix.\"</ref> For an extended format with a precision between two basic formats the exponent range must be as great as that of the next wider basic format. So for instance a 64-bit extended precision binary number must have an 'emax' of at least 16383. The [[x87]] [[Extended precision#x86 extended precision format|80-bit extended format]] meets this requirement.\n\n=== Interchange formats ===\nInterchange formats are intended for the exchange of floating-point data using a bit string of fixed length for a given format. \n\n====Binary====\nFor the exchange of binary floating-point numbers, interchange formats of length 16 bits, 32 bits, 64 bits, and any multiple of 32 bits \u2265 128<ref group=\"lower-alpha\">Contrary to decimal, there is no binary interchange format of 96-bit length. Such a format is still allowed as a non-interchange format, though.</ref> are defined.  The 16-bit format is intended for the exchange or storage of small numbers (e.g., for graphics).\n\nThe encoding scheme for these binary interchange formats is the same as that of IEEE 754-1985: a sign bit, followed by ''w'' exponent bits that describe the exponent offset by a ''[[Exponent bias|bias]]'', and ''p''&nbsp;\u2212&nbsp;1 bits that describe the significand.  The width of the exponent field for a ''k''-bit format is computed as ''w''&nbsp;=&nbsp;round(4&nbsp;log<sub>2</sub>(''k''))&nbsp;\u2212&nbsp;13.  The existing 64- and 128-bit formats follow this rule, but the 16- and 32-bit formats have more exponent bits (5 and 8 respectively) than this formula would provide (3 and 7 respectively).\n\nAs with IEEE 754-1985, the biased-exponent field is filled with all 1 bits to indicate either infinity (trailing significand field = 0) or a NaN (trailing significand field \u2260 0).  For NaNs, quiet NaNs and signaling NaNs are distinguished by using the most significant bit of the trailing significand field exclusively,{{efn|The standard recommends 0 for signaling NaNs, 1 for quiet NaNs, so that a signaling NaNs can be quieted by changing only this bit to 1, while the reverse could yield the encoding of an infinity.}} and the payload is carried in the remaining bits.\n\n====Decimal====\nFor the exchange of decimal floating-point numbers, interchange formats of any multiple of 32 bits are defined. As with binary interchange, the encoding scheme for the decimal interchange formats encodes the sign, exponent, and significand. Two different bit-level representations are defined and interchange is complicated by the fact that some external indicator of the representation in use is required.\n\nThe two options allow the significand to be encoded as a compressed sequence of decimal digits using [[densely packed decimal]] or, alternatively, as a binary integer.  The former is more convenient for direct hardware implementation of the standard, while the latter is more suited to software emulation on a binary computer.  In either case, the set of numbers (combinations of sign, significand, and exponent) that may be encoded is identical, and [[Floating point#Special values|special values]] (\u00b1zero, \u00b1infinity, quiet NaNs, and signaling NaNs) have identical binary representations.\n\n== Rounding rules ==\nThe standard defines five rounding rules.  The first two rules round to a nearest value; the others are called ''[[directed rounding]]s'':\n\n=== Roundings to nearest ===\n* '''[[Rounding#Round half to even|Round to nearest, ties to even]]'''&nbsp;\u2013 rounds to the nearest value; if the number falls midway, it is rounded to the nearest value with an even least significant digit; this is the default for binary floating point and the recommended default for decimal.\n* '''[[Rounding#Round half away from zero|Round to nearest, ties away from zero]]'''&nbsp;\u2013 rounds to the nearest value; if the number falls midway, it is rounded to the nearest value above (for positive numbers) or below (for negative numbers); this is intended as an option for decimal floating point.\n\n=== Directed roundings ===\n* '''Round toward 0'''&nbsp;\u2013 directed rounding towards zero (also known as ''truncation'').\n* '''Round toward +\u221e'''&nbsp;\u2013 directed rounding towards positive infinity (also known as ''rounding up'' or ''ceiling'').\n* '''Round toward \u2212\u221e'''&nbsp;\u2013 directed rounding towards negative infinity (also known as ''rounding down'' or ''floor'').\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+ Example of rounding to integers using the IEEE 754 rules\n!rowspan=2| Mode ||colspan=4| Example value\n|-\n! +11.5\n! +12.5\n! \u221211.5\n! \u221212.5\n|-\n| to nearest, ties to even\n| +12.0\n| +12.0\n| \u221212.0\n| \u221212.0\n|-\n| to nearest, ties away from zero\n| +12.0\n| +13.0\n| \u221212.0\n| \u221213.0\n|-\n| toward 0\n| +11.0\n| +12.0\n| \u221211.0\n| \u221212.0\n|-\n| toward +\u221e\n| +12.0\n| +13.0\n| \u221211.0\n| \u221212.0\n|-\n| toward \u2212\u221e\n| +11.0\n| +12.0\n| \u221212.0\n| \u221213.0\n|}\n\nUnless specified otherwise, the floating-point result of an operation is determined by applying the rounding function on the infinitely precise (mathematical) result. The operation is said to be ''correctly rounded''.  This requirement is called ''correct rounding''.<ref>{{Harvnb|IEEE 754|2019|loc=\u00a72.1}}</ref>\n\n== Required operations ==\n\nRequired operations for a supported arithmetic format (including the basic formats) include:\n\n* Arithmetic operations (add, subtract, multiply, divide, square root, [[Multiply\u2013accumulate operation|fused multiply\u2013add]], remainder)<ref>{{Harvnb|IEEE 754|2008|loc=\u00a75.3.1}}</ref><ref>{{Harvnb|IEEE 754|2008|loc=\u00a75.4.1}}</ref>\n* Conversions (between formats, to and from strings, ''etc.'')<ref>{{Harvnb|IEEE 754|2008|loc=\u00a75.4.2}}</ref><ref>{{Harvnb|IEEE 754|2008|loc=\u00a75.4.3}}</ref>\n* Scaling and (for decimal) quantizing<ref>{{Harvnb|IEEE 754|2008|loc=\u00a75.3.2}}</ref><ref>{{Harvnb|IEEE 754|2008|loc=\u00a75.3.3}}</ref>\n* Copying and manipulating the sign (abs, negate, ''etc.'')<ref>{{Harvnb|IEEE 754|2008|loc=\u00a75.5.1}}</ref>\n* Comparisons and total ordering<ref name=total-ordering>{{Harvnb|IEEE 754|2008|loc=\u00a75.10}}</ref><ref>{{Harvnb|IEEE 754|2008|loc=\u00a75.11}}</ref>\n* Classification and testing for NaNs, ''etc.''<ref>{{Harvnb|IEEE 754|2008|loc=\u00a75.7.2}}</ref>\n* Testing and setting flags<ref>{{Harvnb|IEEE 754|2008|loc=\u00a75.7.4}}</ref>\n* Miscellaneous operations.\n\n=== Comparison predicates ===\n\nThe standard provides comparison predicates to compare one floating-point datum to another in the supported arithmetic format.<ref>{{Harvnb|IEEE 754|2019|loc=\u00a75.11}}</ref> Any comparison with a NaN is treated as unordered. \u22120 and +0 compare as equal.\n\n=== Total-ordering predicate ===\n\nThe standard provides a predicate ''totalOrder'', which defines a [[total order]]ing on canonical members of the supported arithmetic format.<ref>{{Harvnb|IEEE 754|2019|loc=\u00a75.10}}</ref> The predicate agrees with the comparison predicates when one floating-point number is less than the other. The ''totalOrder'' predicate does not impose a total ordering on all encodings in a format. In particular, it does not distinguish among different encodings of the same floating-point representation, as when one or both encodings are non-canonical.<ref>{{Harvnb|IEEE 754|2019|loc=\u00a75.10}}</ref> IEEE 754-2019 incorporates clarifications of ''totalOrder''.\n\n== Exception handling ==\nThe standard defines five exceptions, each of which returns a default value and has a corresponding status flag that (except in certain cases of underflow) is raised when the exception occurs.  No other exception handling is required, but additional non-default alternatives are recommended (see below).\n\nThe five possible exceptions are:\n* Invalid operation: mathematically undefined, ''e.g.'', the square root of a negative number. By default, returns qNaN.\n* Division by zero: an operation on finite operands gives an exact infinite result, ''e.g.'', 1/0 or log(0). By default, returns \u00b1infinity.\n* Overflow: a result is too large to be represented correctly (''i.e.'', its exponent with an unbounded exponent range would be larger than ''emax''). By default, returns \u00b1infinity for the round-to-nearest modes (and follows the rounding rules for the directed rounding modes).\n* Underflow: a result is very small (outside the normal range) and is inexact. By default, returns a [[Denormal number|subnormal]] or zero (following the rounding rules).\n* Inexact: the exact (''i.e.'', unrounded) result is not representable exactly. By default, returns the correctly rounded result.\n\nThese are the same five exceptions as were defined in IEEE 754-1985, but the ''division by zero'' exception has been extended to operations other than the division.\n\nFor decimal floating point, there are additional exceptions along with the above:<ref>{{cite web|url=https://docs.python.org/library/decimal.html#signals|title=9.4. decimal \u2014 Decimal fixed point and floating point arithmetic \u2014 Python 3.6.5 documentation|website=docs.python.org|accessdate=4 April 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://speleotrove.com/decimal/daexcep.html|title=Decimal Arithmetic - Exceptional conditions|website=speleotrove.com|accessdate=4 April 2018}}</ref>\n* Clamped: a result's exponent is too large for the destination format. By default, trailing zeros will be added to the coefficient to reduce the exponent to the largest usable value. If this is not possible (because this would cause the number of digits needed to be more than the destination format) then overflow occurs.\n* Rounded: a result's coefficient requires more digits than the destination format provides. The inexact is signaled if any non-zero digits are discarded.\n\nAdditionally, operations like quantize when either operand is infinite, or when the result does not fit the destination format, will also signal invalid operation exception.<ref>{{Harvnb|IEEE 754|2008|loc=&sect;7.2(h)}}</ref>\n\n== Recommendations ==\n\n=== Alternate exception handling ===\nThe standard recommends optional exception handling in various forms, including presubstitution of user-defined default values, and traps (exceptions that change the flow of control in some way) and other exception handling models which interrupt the flow, such as try/catch.  The traps and other exception mechanisms remain optional, as they were in IEEE 754-1985.\n\n=== Recommended operations ===\nClause 9 in the standard recommends additional mathematical operations<ref>{{Harvnb|IEEE 754|2019|loc=\u00a79.2}}</ref> that language standards should define.<ref>{{Harvnb|IEEE 754|2008|loc=Clause 9}}.</ref>  These are all optional (not required in order to conform to the standard).\n\nRecommended arithmetic operations, which must round correctly:<ref>{{Harvnb|IEEE 754|2019|loc=\u00a79.2}}.</ref>\n* [[e\u02e3|<math>e^x</math>]], <math>2^x</math>, <math>10^x</math>\n* [[e\u02e3\u22121|<math>e^x - 1</math>]], <math>2^x - 1</math>, <math>10^x - 1</math>\n* [[Natural logarithm|<math>\\ln x</math>]], [[Binary logarithm|<math>\\log_{2} x</math>]], [[Common logarithm|<math>\\log_{10} x</math>]]\n* [[ln(1+x)|<math>\\ln (1 + x)</math>]], <math>\\log_{2} (1 + x)</math>, <math>\\log_{10} (1 + x)</math>\n* [[Hypot|<math>\\sqrt{x^2 + y^2}</math>]]\n* [[Square root|<math>\\sqrt{x}</math>]]\n* <math>(1 + x)^n</math>\n* [[nth root|<math>x^{\\frac{1}{n}}</math>]]\n* [[Exponentiation#Integer exponents|<math>x^n</math>]], [[Exponentiation|<math>x^y</math>]]\n* [[sin (trigonometry)|<math>\\sin x</math>]], [[cos (trigonometry)|<math>\\cos x</math>]], [[tan (trigonometry)|<math>\\tan x</math>]]\n* [[arcsin (trigonometry)|<math>\\arcsin x</math>]], [[arccos (trigonometry)|<math>\\arccos x</math>]], [[arctan (trigonometry)|<math>\\arctan x</math>]], [[atan2|<math>\\operatorname{atan2}(y, x)</math>]]\n* <math>\\operatorname{sinPi} x = \\sin \\pi x</math>, <math>\\operatorname{cosPi} x = \\cos \\pi x</math>, <math>\\operatorname{tanPi} x = \\tan \\pi x</math> (see also: [[Multiples of \u03c0]])\n* <math>\\operatorname{asinPi} x = \\frac{\\arcsin x}{\\pi}</math>, <math>\\operatorname{acosPi} x = \\frac{\\arccos x}{\\pi}</math>, <math>\\operatorname{atanPi} x = \\frac{\\arctan x}{\\pi}</math>, <math>\\operatorname{atan2Pi} (y, x) = \\frac{\\operatorname{atan2}(y, x)}{\\pi}</math> (see also: [[Multiples of \u03c0]])\n* [[sinh (mathematical function)|<math>\\sinh x</math>]], [[cosh (mathematical function)|<math>\\cosh x</math>]], [[tanh (mathematical function)|<math>\\tanh x</math>]]\n* [[arsinh|<math>\\operatorname{arsinh} x</math>]], [[arcosh|<math>\\operatorname{arcosh} x</math>]], [[artanh|<math>\\operatorname{artanh} x</math>]]\n\nThe {{math|asinPi}}, {{math|acosPi}} and {{math|tanPi}} functions were not part of the IEEE 754-2008 standard because the feeling was that they were less necessary.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://grouper.ieee.org/groups/754/email/msg03842.html |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170706053605/http://grouper.ieee.org/groups/754/email/msg03842.html |archive-date=2017-07-06 |title=Re: Missing functions tanPi, asinPi and acosPi |website=grouper.ieee.org |access-date=4 April 2018}}</ref> The first two were at least mentioned in a paragraph, but this was regarded as an error<ref name=IEEE754-errata/> until they were added in the 2019 revision.\n\nThe operations also include setting and accessing dynamic mode rounding direction,<ref>{{Harvnb|IEEE 754|2008|loc=\u00a79.3}}.</ref> and implementation-defined vector reduction operations such as sum, scaled product, and [[dot product]], whose accuracy is unspecified by the standard.<ref>{{Harvnb|IEEE 754|2008|loc=\u00a79.4}}.</ref>\n\n{{anchor|Augmented arithmetic operation}}\nAs of 2019, ''augmented arithmetic operations''<ref>{{Harvnb|IEEE 754|2019|loc=\u00a79.5}}.</ref> for the binary formats are also recommended.

By contrast, the previous [[IEEE 754-1985|1985]] version of the standard left aspects of the language interface unspecified, which led to inconsistent behavior between compilers, or different optimization levels in a single compiler.\n\nProgramming languages should allow a user to specify a minimum precision for intermediate calculations of expressions for each radix. This is referred to as \"preferredWidth\" in the standard, and it should be possible to set this on a per block basis. Intermediate calculations within expressions should be calculated, and any temporaries saved, using the maximum of the width of the operands and the preferred width, if set. Thus, for instance, a compiler targeting [[x87]] floating-point hardware should have a means of specifying that intermediate calculations must use the [[Extended precision#IEEE 754 extended precision formats|double-extended format]]. The stored value of a variable must always be used when evaluating subsequent expressions, rather than any precursor from before rounding and assigning to the variable.\n\n=== Reproducibility ===\nThe IEEE 754-1985 allowed many variations in implementations (such as the encoding of some values and the detection of certain exceptions). IEEE 754-2008 has strengthened up many of these, but a few variations still remain (especially for binary formats).  The reproducibility clause recommends that language standards should provide a means to write reproducible programs (i.e., programs that will produce the same result in all implementations of a language) and describes what needs to be done to achieve reproducible results.\n\n== Character representation ==\nThe standard requires operations to convert between basic formats and ''external character sequence'' formats.<ref>{{Harvnb|IEEE 754|2008|loc=\u00a75.12}}.</ref> Conversions to and from a decimal character format are required for all formats. Conversion to an external character sequence must be such that conversion back using rounding to even will recover the original number. There is no requirement to preserve the payload of a quiet NaN or signaling NaN, and conversion from the external character sequence may turn a signaling NaN into a quiet NaN.\n\nThe original binary value will be preserved by converting to decimal and back again using:<ref>{{Harvnb|IEEE 754|2008|loc=\u00a75.12.2}}.</ref>\n* 5 decimal digits for binary16,\n* 9 decimal digits for binary32,\n* 17 decimal digits for binary64,\n* 36 decimal digits for binary128.\n\nFor other binary formats, the required number of decimal digits is\n\n: <math>1 + \\lceil p\\log_{10}(2)\\rceil,</math>\n\nwhere ''p'' is the number of significant bits in the binary format, e.g. 237 bits for binary256.\n\n(Note: as an implementation limit, correct rounding is only guaranteed for the number of decimal digits above plus 3 for the largest supported binary format. For instance, if binary32 is the largest supported binary format, then a conversion from a decimal external sequence with 12 decimal digits is guaranteed to be correctly rounded when converted to binary32; but conversion of a sequence of 13 decimal digits is not; however, the standard recommends that implementations impose no such limit.)\n\nWhen using a decimal floating-point format, the decimal representation will be preserved using:\n* 7 decimal digits for decimal32,\n* 16 decimal digits for decimal64,\n* 34 decimal digits for decimal128.\n\nAlgorithms, with code, for correctly rounded conversion from binary to decimal and decimal to binary are discussed by Gay,<ref>{{Cite journal |first=David M. |last=Gay |title=Correctly rounded binary-decimal and decimal-binary conversions |series=Numerical Analysis Manuscript |id=90-10 |publisher=AT&T Laboratories |location=Murry Hill, NJ, USA |date=November 30, 1990 |url=http://citeseer.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary?doi=10.1.1.31.4049 |doi= |ref=harv }}</ref> and for testing{{snd}} by Paxson and Kahan.<ref>{{Cite journal |title=A Program for Testing IEEE Decimal\u2013Binary Conversion |publisher= |series=Manuscript |first1=Vern |last1=Paxson |first2=William |last2=Kahan |author2-link=William Kahan |date=May 22, 1991 |doi= |ref=harv |citeseerx = 10.1.1.144.5889}}</ref>\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Binade]]\n* [[Coprocessor]]\n* [[C99#IEEE.C2.A0754 floating point support|C99]] for code examples demonstrating  access and use of IEEE 754 features.\n* [[Floating-point arithmetic#IEEE 754: floating point in modern computers|Floating-point arithmetic]], for history, design rationale and example usage of IEEE 754 features.\n* [[Fixed-point arithmetic]], for an alternative approach at computation with rational numbers (especially beneficial when the mantissa range is known, fixed, or bound at compile time).\n* [[IBM System z9]], the first CPU to implement IEEE 754-2008 decimal arithmetic (using hardware microcode).\n* [[IBM z10 (microprocessor)|IBM z10]], [[IBM z196]], [[IBM zEC12 (microprocessor)|IBM zEC12]], and [[IBM z13 (microprocessor)|IBM z13]], CPUs that implement IEEE 754-2008  decimal arithmetic fully in hardware.\n* [[ISO/IEC 10967]], language-independent arithmetic (LIA).\n* [[Minifloat]], low-precision binary floating-point formats following IEEE 754 principles.\n* [[POWER6]], [[POWER7]], and [[POWER8]] CPUs that implement IEEE 754-2008 decimal arithmetic fully in hardware.\n* [[strictfp]], a keyword in the [[Java (programming language)|Java programming language]] that restricts arithmetic to IEEE 754 single and double precision to ensure reproducibility across common hardware platforms.\n* [[Rounding#Table-maker's dilemma|The table-maker's dilemma]] for more about the correct rounding of functions.\n* [[Standard Apple Numerics Environment]]\n* [[Tapered floating point]]\n\n== Notes ==\n{{Reflist|group=\"lower-alpha\"}}\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n=== Standards ===\n* {{Cite book |title=IEEE Standard for Floating-Point Arithmetic |journal=IEEE STD 754-2008 |pages=1\u201370 |author=IEEE Computer Society |date=August 29, 2008 |publisher=IEEE |id=IEEE Std 754-2008 |doi=10.1109/IEEESTD.2008.4610935 |ref=CITEREFIEEE_7542008 |isbn=978-0-7381-5753-5 }}\n* {{Cite book |title=IEEE Standard for Floating-Point Arithmetic |journal=IEEE STD 754-2019 |pages=1\u201384 |author=IEEE Computer Society |date=July 22, 2019 |publisher=IEEE |id=IEEE Std 754-2019 |doi=10.1109/IEEESTD.2019.8766229  |isbn=978-1-5044-5924-2 }}\n* {{Cite book |title=ISO/IEC/IEEE 60559:2011 \u2014 Information technology \u2014 Microprocessor Systems \u2014 Floating-Point arithmetic |url=https://www.iso.org/standard/57469.html |publisher=Iso.org |pages=1\u201358 |date=June 2011}}\n\n=== Secondary references ===\n* [http://speleotrove.com/decimal Decimal floating-point] arithmetic, FAQs, bibliography, and links\n* [http://www.cygnus-software.com/papers/comparingfloats/comparingfloats.htm Comparing binary floats]\n* [http://babbage.cs.qc.cuny.edu/IEEE-754.old/References.xhtml IEEE 754 Reference Material]\n* [http://speleotrove.com/decimal/854mins.html IEEE 854-1987]&nbsp;\u2013 History and minutes\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20171230124220/http://grouper.ieee.org/groups/754/reading.html Supplementary readings for IEEE 754].

The standard [[Floating-point arithmetic#IEEE 754 design rationale|addressed many problems]] found in the diverse floating-point implementations that made them difficult to use reliably and [[Software portability|portably]]. Many hardware [[floating-point unit]]s use the IEEE 754 standard.\n\nThe standard defines:\n* ''arithmetic formats:'' sets of [[Binary code|binary]] and [[decimal]] floating-point data, which consist of finite numbers (including [[signed zero]]s and [[subnormal number]]s), [[infinity|infinities]], and special \"not a number\" values ([[NaN]]s)\n* ''interchange formats:'' encodings (bit strings) that may be used to exchange floating-point data in an efficient and compact form\n* ''rounding rules:'' properties to be satisfied when rounding numbers during arithmetic and conversions\n* ''operations:'' arithmetic and other operations (such as [[trigonometric functions]]) on arithmetic formats\n* ''exception handling:'' indications of exceptional conditions (such as [[division by zero]], overflow, ''etc.'')\n\n[[IEEE 754-2008 revision|IEEE 754-2008]], published in August 2008, includes nearly all of the original [[IEEE 754-1985]] standard, plus the [[IEEE 854-1987|IEEE 854-1987 Standard for Radix-Independent Floating-Point Arithmetic]].  {{anchor|2019}}The current version, IEEE 754-2019, was published in July 2019.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://standards.ieee.org/content/ieee-standards/en/standard/754-2019.html|title=IEEE 754-2019 - IEEE Standard for Floating-Point Arithmetic|website=standards.ieee.org|accessdate=23 July 2019}}</ref> It is a minor revision of the previous version, incorporating mainly clarifications, defect fixes and new recommended operations.\n\n==Standard development==\nThe first standard for floating-point arithmetic, [[IEEE 754-1985]], was published in 1985.

The binary formats in the original standard are included in this new standard along with three new basic formats, one binary and two decimal.  To conform to the current standard, an implementation must implement at least one of the basic formats as both an arithmetic format and an interchange format.\n\nThe international standard '''ISO/IEC/IEEE 60559:2011''' (with content identical to IEEE 754-2008) has been approved for adoption through [[ISO/IEC JTC1|JTC1]]/SC 25 under the ISO/IEEE PSDO Agreement<ref>{{cite web|url=http://grouper.ieee.org/groups/754/email/msg04167.html|title=FW: ISO/IEC/IEEE 60559 (IEEE Std 754-2008)|website=grouper.ieee.org|accessdate=4 April 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171027190846/http://grouper.ieee.org/groups/754/email/msg04167.html|archive-date=2017-10-27}}</ref> and published.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.iso.org/iso/iso_catalogue/catalogue_tc/catalogue_detail.htm?csnumber=57469|title=ISO/IEC/IEEE 60559:2011 - Information technology -- Microprocessor Systems -- Floating-Point arithmetic|website=www.iso.org|accessdate=4 April 2018}}</ref>\n\nThe current version, IEEE 754-2019 published in July 2019, is derived from and replaces IEEE 754-2008, following a revision process started in September 2015, chaired by David G.

A format may also include how the set is encoded.<ref>{{Harvnb|IEEE 754|2008|loc=\u00a72.1.27}}.</ref>\n\nA floating-point format is specified by:\n* a base (also called ''radix'') ''b'', which is either 2 (binary) or 10 (decimal) in IEEE 754;\n* a precision ''p'';\n* an exponent range from ''emin'' to ''emax'', with ''emin'' = 1 \u2212 ''emax'' for all IEEE 754 formats.\n\nA format comprises:\n* Finite numbers, which can be described by three integers: ''s''&nbsp;= a ''sign'' (zero or one), ''c''&nbsp;= a ''[[significand]]'' (or ''coefficient'') having no more than ''p'' digits when written in base ''b'' (i.e., an integer in the range through 0 to ''b''<sup>''p''</sup>&nbsp;\u2212&nbsp;1), and ''q''&nbsp;= an ''exponent'' such that ''emin'' \u2264 ''q''&nbsp;+&nbsp;''p''&nbsp;\u2212&nbsp;1 \u2264 ''emax''. The numerical value of such a finite number is {{nowrap|(\u22121)<sup>''s''</sup> \u00d7 ''c'' \u00d7 ''b''<sup>''q''</sup>}}.<ref group=\"lower-alpha\">For example, if the base is 10, the sign is 1 (indicating negative), the significand is 12345, and the exponent is \u22123, then the value of the number is {{nowrap|(\u22121)<sup>1</sup> \u00d7 12345 \u00d7 10<sup>\u22123</sup>}} = {{nowrap|\u22121 \u00d7 12345 \u00d7 0.001}} = \u221212.345.</ref> Moreover, there are two zero values, called [[signed zero]]s: the sign bit specifies whether a zero is +0 (positive zero) or \u22120 (negative zero).\n* Two infinities: +\u221e and \u2212\u221e.\n* Two kinds of [[NaN]] (not-a-number): a quiet NaN (qNaN) and a signaling NaN (sNaN).\n\nFor example, if ''b'' = 10, ''p'' = 7, and ''emax'' = 96, then ''emin'' = \u221295, the significand satisfies 0 \u2264 ''c'' \u2264 {{val|9999999}}, and the exponent satisfies \u2212101 \u2264 ''q'' \u2264 90. Consequently, the smallest non-zero positive number that can be represented is 1\u00d710<sup>\u2212101</sup>, and the largest is 9999999\u00d710<sup>90</sup> (9.999999\u00d710<sup>96</sup>), so the full range of numbers is \u22129.999999\u00d710<sup>96</sup> through 9.999999\u00d710<sup>96</sup>. The numbers \u2212''b''<sup>1\u2212''emax''</sup> and ''b''<sup>1\u2212''emax''</sup> (here, \u22121\u00d710<sup>\u221295</sup> and 1\u00d710<sup>\u221295</sup>) are the smallest (in magnitude) ''normal numbers''; non-zero numbers between these smallest numbers are called [[subnormal number]]s.\n\n=== Representation and encoding in memory ===\nSome numbers may have several possible exponential format representations. For instance, if ''b''\u00a0=\u00a010, and ''p''\u00a0=\u00a07, then \u221212.345 can be represented by \u221212345\u00d710<sup>\u22123</sup>, \u2212123450\u00d710<sup>\u22124</sup>, and \u22121234500\u00d710<sup>\u22125</sup>. However, for most operations, such as arithmetic operations, the result (value) does not depend on the representation of the inputs.\n\nFor the decimal formats, any representation is valid, and the set of these representations is called a ''cohort''. When a result can have several representations, the standard specifies which member of the cohort is chosen.\n\nFor the binary formats, the representation is made unique by choosing the smallest representable exponent allowing the value to be represented exactly. Further, the exponent is not represented directly, but a bias is added so that the smallest representable exponent is represented as 1, with 0 used for subnormal numbers. For numbers with an exponent in the normal range (the exponent field being not all ones or all zeros), the leading bit of the significand will always be 1. Consequently, a leading 1 can be implied rather than explicitly present in the memory encoding, and under the standard the explicitly represented part of the significand will lie between 0 and 1. This rule is called ''leading bit convention'', ''implicit bit convention'', or ''hidden bit convention''. This rule allows the binary format to have an extra bit of precision. The leading bit convention cannot be used for the subnormal numbers as they have an exponent outside the normal exponent range and scale by the smallest represented exponent as used for the smallest normal numbers.\n\nDue to the possibility of multiple encodings (at least in formats called ''interchange formats''), a NaN may carry other information: a sign bit (which has no meaning, but may be used by some operations) and a ''payload'', which is intended for diagnostic information indicating the source of the NaN (but the payload may have other uses, such as ''NaN-boxing''<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Projects/SpiderMonkey/Internals |title=SpiderMonkey Internals |website=developer.mozilla.org |accessdate=11 March 2018}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book |last1=Klemens |first1=Ben |title=21st Century C: C Tips from the New School |date=September 2014 |publisher=O'Reilly Media, Incorporated |page=160 |url=https://books.google.fr/books?id=ASuiBAAAQBAJ |accessdate=11 March 2018|isbn=9781491904442 }}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url=https://github.com/zuiderkwast/nanbox |title=zuiderkwast/nanbox: NaN-boxing in C |website=[[GitHub]] |accessdate=11 March 2018}}</ref>).\n\n=== Basic and interchange formats ===\n\nThe standard defines five basic formats that are named for their numeric base and the number of bits used in their interchange encoding. There are three binary floating-point basic formats (encoded with 32, 64 or 128 bits) and two decimal floating-point basic formats (encoded with 64 or 128 bits). The [[binary32]] and [[binary64]] formats are the ''single'' and ''double'' formats of [[IEEE 754-1985]] respectively. A conforming implementation must fully implement at least one of the basic formats.\n\nThe standard also defines ''[[#Interchange formats|interchange formats]]'', which generalize these basic formats.<ref>{{Harvnb|IEEE 754|2008|loc=\u00a73.6}}.</ref> For the binary formats, the leading bit convention is required. The following table summarizes the smallest interchange formats (including the basic ones).\n\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n! Name                                                   !! Common name        !!

For example, the smallest positive number that can be represented in binary64 is 2<sup>\u22121074</sup>; contributions to the \u22121074 figure include the E&nbsp;min value \u22121022 and all but one of the 53 significand bits (2<sup>\u22121022&nbsp;\u2212&nbsp;(53&nbsp;\u2212&nbsp;1)</sup>&nbsp;=&nbsp;2<sup>\u22121074</sup>).\n\nDecimal digits is ''digits'' \u00d7 log<sub>10</sub> ''base''. This gives an approximate precision in number of decimal digits.\n\nDecimal E max is ''Emax'' \u00d7 log<sub>10</sub> ''base''. This gives an approximate value of the maximum decimal exponent.\n\nThe binary32 (single) and binary64 (double) formats are two of the most common formats used today. The figure below shows the absolute precision for both formats over a range of values. This figure can be used to select an appropriate format given the expected value of a number and the required precision.\n\n[[File:IEEE754.svg|thumb|none|frame|550px|Precision of binary32 and binary64 in the range 10<sup>\u221212</sup> to 10<sup>12</sup>]]\n\n\nAn example of a layout for [[Single-precision floating-point format|32-bit floating point]] is\n[[File:Float example.svg|none]]\n \nand the [[Double-precision floating-point format|64 bit layout is similar]].\n\n=== Extended and extendable precision formats ===\nThe standard specifies optional [[Extended precision|extended]] and extendable precision formats, which provide greater precision than the basic formats.<ref>{{Harvnb|IEEE 754|2008|loc=\u00a73.7}}.</ref> An extended precision format extends a basic format by using more precision and more exponent range. An extendable precision format allows the user to specify the precision and exponent range. An implementation may use whatever internal representation it chooses for such formats; all that needs to be defined are its parameters (''b'', ''p'', and ''emax''). These parameters uniquely describe the set of finite numbers (combinations of sign, significand, and exponent for the given radix) that it can represent.\n\nThe standard recommends that language standards provide a method of specifying ''p'' and ''emax'' for each supported base ''b''.<ref>{{Harvnb|IEEE 754|2008|loc=\u00a73.7}} states: \"Language standards should define mechanisms supporting extendable precision for each supported radix.\"</ref><!-- extendable recommendation does not apply to \"implementations\". --> The standard recommends that language standards and implementations support an extended format which has a greater precision than the largest basic format supported for each radix ''b''.<ref>{{Harvnb|IEEE 754|2008|loc=\u00a73.7}} states: \"Language standards or implementations should support an extended precision format that extends the widest basic format that is supported in that radix.\"</ref> For an extended format with a precision between two basic formats the exponent range must be as great as that of the next wider basic format. So for instance a 64-bit extended precision binary number must have an 'emax' of at least 16383. The [[x87]] [[Extended precision#x86 extended precision format|80-bit extended format]] meets this requirement.\n\n=== Interchange formats ===\nInterchange formats are intended for the exchange of floating-point data using a bit string of fixed length for a given format. \n\n====Binary====\nFor the exchange of binary floating-point numbers, interchange formats of length 16 bits, 32 bits, 64 bits, and any multiple of 32 bits \u2265 128<ref group=\"lower-alpha\">Contrary to decimal, there is no binary interchange format of 96-bit length. Such a format is still allowed as a non-interchange format, though.</ref> are defined.  The 16-bit format is intended for the exchange or storage of small numbers (e.g., for graphics).\n\nThe encoding scheme for these binary interchange formats is the same as that of IEEE 754-1985: a sign bit, followed by ''w'' exponent bits that describe the exponent offset by a ''[[Exponent bias|bias]]'', and ''p''&nbsp;\u2212&nbsp;1 bits that describe the significand.  The width of the exponent field for a ''k''-bit format is computed as ''w''&nbsp;=&nbsp;round(4&nbsp;log<sub>2</sub>(''k''))&nbsp;\u2212&nbsp;13.  The existing 64- and 128-bit formats follow this rule, but the 16- and 32-bit formats have more exponent bits (5 and 8 respectively) than this formula would provide (3 and 7 respectively).\n\nAs with IEEE 754-1985, the biased-exponent field is filled with all 1 bits to indicate either infinity (trailing significand field = 0) or a NaN (trailing significand field \u2260 0).  For NaNs, quiet NaNs and signaling NaNs are distinguished by using the most significant bit of the trailing significand field exclusively,{{efn|The standard recommends 0 for signaling NaNs, 1 for quiet NaNs, so that a signaling NaNs can be quieted by changing only this bit to 1, while the reverse could yield the encoding of an infinity.}} and the payload is carried in the remaining bits.\n\n====Decimal====\nFor the exchange of decimal floating-point numbers, interchange formats of any multiple of 32 bits are defined. As with binary interchange, the encoding scheme for the decimal interchange formats encodes the sign, exponent, and significand. Two different bit-level representations are defined and interchange is complicated by the fact that some external indicator of the representation in use is required.\n\nThe two options allow the significand to be encoded as a compressed sequence of decimal digits using [[densely packed decimal]] or, alternatively, as a binary integer.  The former is more convenient for direct hardware implementation of the standard, while the latter is more suited to software emulation on a binary computer.  In either case, the set of numbers (combinations of sign, significand, and exponent) that may be encoded is identical, and [[Floating point#Special values|special values]] (\u00b1zero, \u00b1infinity, quiet NaNs, and signaling NaNs) have identical binary representations.<!--[[User:Kvng/RTH]]-->\n\n== Rounding rules ==\nThe standard defines five rounding rules.  The first two rules round to a nearest value; the others are called ''[[directed rounding]]s'':\n\n=== Roundings to nearest ===\n* '''[[Rounding#Round half to even|Round to nearest, ties to even]]'''&nbsp;\u2013 rounds to the nearest value; if the number falls midway, it is rounded to the nearest value with an even least significant digit; this is the default for binary floating point and the recommended default for decimal.\n* '''[[Rounding#Round half away from zero|Round to nearest, ties away from zero]]'''&nbsp;\u2013 rounds to the nearest value; if the number falls midway, it is rounded to the nearest value above (for positive numbers) or below (for negative numbers); this is intended as an option for decimal floating point.\n\n=== Directed roundings ===\n* '''Round toward 0'''&nbsp;\u2013 directed rounding towards zero (also known as ''truncation'').\n* '''Round toward +\u221e'''&nbsp;\u2013 directed rounding towards positive infinity (also known as ''rounding up'' or ''ceiling'').\n* '''Round toward \u2212\u221e'''&nbsp;\u2013 directed rounding towards negative infinity (also known as ''rounding down'' or ''floor'').\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+ Example of rounding to integers using the IEEE 754 rules\n!rowspan=2| Mode ||colspan=4| Example value\n|-\n! +11.5\n! +12.5\n! \u221211.5\n! \u221212.5\n|-\n| to nearest, ties to even\n| +12.0\n| +12.0\n| \u221212.0\n| \u221212.0\n|-\n| to nearest, ties away from zero\n| +12.0\n| +13.0\n| \u221212.0\n| \u221213.0\n|-\n| toward 0\n| +11.0\n| +12.0\n| \u221211.0\n| \u221212.0\n|-\n| toward +\u221e\n| +12.0\n| +13.0\n| \u221211.0\n| \u221212.0\n|-\n| toward \u2212\u221e\n| +11.0\n| +12.0\n| \u221212.0\n| \u221213.0\n|}\n\nUnless specified otherwise, the floating-point result of an operation is determined by applying the rounding function on the infinitely precise (mathematical) result. The operation is said to be ''correctly rounded''.  This requirement is called ''correct rounding''.<ref>{{Harvnb|IEEE 754|2019|loc=\u00a72.1}}</ref>\n\n== Required operations ==\n\nRequired operations for a supported arithmetic format (including the basic formats) include:\n\n* Arithmetic operations (add, subtract, multiply, divide, square root, [[Multiply\u2013accumulate operation|fused multiply\u2013add]], remainder)<ref>{{Harvnb|IEEE 754|2008|loc=\u00a75.3.1}}</ref><ref>{{Harvnb|IEEE 754|2008|loc=\u00a75.4.1}}</ref>\n* Conversions (between formats, to and from strings, ''etc.'')<ref>{{Harvnb|IEEE 754|2008|loc=\u00a75.4.2}}</ref><ref>{{Harvnb|IEEE 754|2008|loc=\u00a75.4.3}}</ref>\n* Scaling and (for decimal) quantizing<ref>{{Harvnb|IEEE 754|2008|loc=\u00a75.3.2}}</ref><ref>{{Harvnb|IEEE 754|2008|loc=\u00a75.3.3}}</ref>\n* Copying and manipulating the sign (abs, negate, ''etc.'')<ref>{{Harvnb|IEEE 754|2008|loc=\u00a75.5.1}}</ref>\n* Comparisons and total ordering<ref name=total-ordering>{{Harvnb|IEEE 754|2008|loc=\u00a75.10}}</ref><ref>{{Harvnb|IEEE 754|2008|loc=\u00a75.11}}</ref>\n* Classification and testing for NaNs, ''etc.''<ref>{{Harvnb|IEEE 754|2008|loc=\u00a75.7.2}}</ref>\n* Testing and setting flags<ref>{{Harvnb|IEEE 754|2008|loc=\u00a75.7.4}}</ref>\n* Miscellaneous operations.\n\n=== Comparison predicates ===\n\nThe standard provides comparison predicates to compare one floating-point datum to another in the supported arithmetic format.<ref>{{Harvnb|IEEE 754|2019|loc=\u00a75.11}}</ref> Any comparison with a NaN is treated as unordered. \u22120 and +0 compare as equal.\n\n=== Total-ordering predicate ===\n\nThe standard provides a predicate ''totalOrder'', which defines a [[total order]]ing on canonical members of the supported arithmetic format.<ref>{{Harvnb|IEEE 754|2019|loc=\u00a75.10}}</ref> The predicate agrees with the comparison predicates when one floating-point number is less than the other. The ''totalOrder'' predicate does not impose a total ordering on all encodings in a format. In particular, it does not distinguish among different encodings of the same floating-point representation, as when one or both encodings are non-canonical.<ref>{{Harvnb|IEEE 754|2019|loc=\u00a75.10}}</ref> IEEE 754-2019 incorporates clarifications of ''totalOrder''.\n\n== Exception handling ==\nThe standard defines five exceptions, each of which returns a default value and has a corresponding status flag that (except in certain cases of underflow) is raised when the exception occurs.  No other exception handling is required, but additional non-default alternatives are recommended (see below).\n\nThe five possible exceptions are:\n* Invalid operation: mathematically undefined, ''e.g.'', the square root of a negative number. By default, returns qNaN.\n* Division by zero: an operation on finite operands gives an exact infinite result, ''e.g.'', 1/0 or log(0). By default, returns \u00b1infinity.\n* Overflow: a result is too large to be represented correctly (''i.e.'', its exponent with an unbounded exponent range would be larger than ''emax''). By default, returns \u00b1infinity for the round-to-nearest modes (and follows the rounding rules for the directed rounding modes).\n* Underflow: a result is very small (outside the normal range) and is inexact. By default, returns a [[Denormal number|subnormal]] or zero (following the rounding rules).\n* Inexact: the exact (''i.e.'', unrounded) result is not representable exactly. By default, returns the correctly rounded result.\n\nThese are the same five exceptions as were defined in IEEE 754-1985, but the ''division by zero'' exception has been extended to operations other than the division.\n\nFor decimal floating point, there are additional exceptions along with the above:<ref>{{cite web|url=https://docs.python.org/library/decimal.html#signals|title=9.4. decimal \u2014 Decimal fixed point and floating point arithmetic \u2014 Python 3.6.5 documentation|website=docs.python.org|accessdate=4 April 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://speleotrove.com/decimal/daexcep.html|title=Decimal Arithmetic - Exceptional conditions|website=speleotrove.com|accessdate=4 April 2018}}</ref>\n* Clamped: a result's exponent is too large for the destination format. By default, trailing zeros will be added to the coefficient to reduce the exponent to the largest usable value. If this is not possible (because this would cause the number of digits needed to be more than the destination format) then overflow occurs.\n* Rounded: a result's coefficient requires more digits than the destination format provides. The inexact is signaled if any non-zero digits are discarded.\n\nAdditionally, operations like quantize when either operand is infinite, or when the result does not fit the destination format, will also signal invalid operation exception.<ref>{{Harvnb|IEEE 754|2008|loc=&sect;7.2(h)}}</ref>\n\n== Recommendations ==\n\n=== Alternate exception handling ===\nThe standard recommends optional exception handling in various forms, including presubstitution of user-defined default values, and traps (exceptions that change the flow of control in some way) and other exception handling models which interrupt the flow, such as try/catch.  The traps and other exception mechanisms remain optional, as they were in IEEE 754-1985.\n\n=== Recommended operations ===\nClause 9 in the standard recommends additional mathematical operations<ref>{{Harvnb|IEEE 754|2019|loc=\u00a79.2}}</ref> that language standards should define.<ref>{{Harvnb|IEEE 754|2008|loc=Clause 9}}.</ref>  These are all optional (not required in order to conform to the standard).\n\nRecommended arithmetic operations, which must round correctly:<ref>{{Harvnb|IEEE 754|2019|loc=\u00a79.2}}.</ref>\n* [[e\u02e3|<math>e^x</math>]], <math>2^x</math>, <math>10^x</math>\n* [[e\u02e3\u22121|<math>e^x - 1</math>]], <math>2^x - 1</math>, <math>10^x - 1</math>\n* [[Natural logarithm|<math>\\ln x</math>]], [[Binary logarithm|<math>\\log_{2} x</math>]], [[Common logarithm|<math>\\log_{10} x</math>]]\n* [[ln(1+x)|<math>\\ln (1 + x)</math>]], <math>\\log_{2} (1 + x)</math>, <math>\\log_{10} (1 + x)</math>\n* [[Hypot|<math>\\sqrt{x^2 + y^2}</math>]]\n* [[Square root|<math>\\sqrt{x}</math>]]\n* <math>(1 + x)^n</math>\n* [[nth root|<math>x^{\\frac{1}{n}}</math>]]\n* [[Exponentiation#Integer exponents|<math>x^n</math>]], [[Exponentiation|<math>x^y</math>]]\n* [[sin (trigonometry)|<math>\\sin x</math>]], [[cos (trigonometry)|<math>\\cos x</math>]], [[tan (trigonometry)|<math>\\tan x</math>]]\n* [[arcsin (trigonometry)|<math>\\arcsin x</math>]], [[arccos (trigonometry)|<math>\\arccos x</math>]], [[arctan (trigonometry)|<math>\\arctan x</math>]], [[atan2|<math>\\operatorname{atan2}(y, x)</math>]]\n* <math>\\operatorname{sinPi} x = \\sin \\pi x</math>, <math>\\operatorname{cosPi} x = \\cos \\pi x</math>, <math>\\operatorname{tanPi} x = \\tan \\pi x</math> (see also: [[Multiples of \u03c0]])\n* <math>\\operatorname{asinPi} x = \\frac{\\arcsin x}{\\pi}</math>, <math>\\operatorname{acosPi} x = \\frac{\\arccos x}{\\pi}</math>, <math>\\operatorname{atanPi} x = \\frac{\\arctan x}{\\pi}</math>, <math>\\operatorname{atan2Pi} (y, x) = \\frac{\\operatorname{atan2}(y, x)}{\\pi}</math> (see also: [[Multiples of \u03c0]])\n* [[sinh (mathematical function)|<math>\\sinh x</math>]], [[cosh (mathematical function)|<math>\\cosh x</math>]], [[tanh (mathematical function)|<math>\\tanh x</math>]]\n* [[arsinh|<math>\\operatorname{arsinh} x</math>]], [[arcosh|<math>\\operatorname{arcosh} x</math>]], [[artanh|<math>\\operatorname{artanh} x</math>]]\n\nThe {{math|asinPi}}, {{math|acosPi}} and {{math|tanPi}} functions were not part of the IEEE 754-2008 standard because the feeling was that they were less necessary.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://grouper.ieee.org/groups/754/email/msg03842.html |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170706053605/http://grouper.ieee.org/groups/754/email/msg03842.html |archive-date=2017-07-06 |title=Re: Missing functions tanPi, asinPi and acosPi |website=grouper.ieee.org |access-date=4 April 2018}}</ref> The first two were at least mentioned in a paragraph, but this was regarded as an error<ref name=IEEE754-errata/> until they were added in the 2019 revision.\n\nThe operations also include setting and accessing dynamic mode rounding direction,<ref>{{Harvnb|IEEE 754|2008|loc=\u00a79.3}}.</ref> and implementation-defined vector reduction operations such as sum, scaled product, and [[dot product]], whose accuracy is unspecified by the standard.<ref>{{Harvnb|IEEE 754|2008|loc=\u00a79.4}}.</ref>\n\n{{anchor|Augmented arithmetic operation}}\nAs of 2019, ''augmented arithmetic operations''<ref>{{Harvnb|IEEE 754|2019|loc=\u00a79.5}}.</ref> for the binary formats are also recommended.

By contrast, the previous [[IEEE 754-1985|1985]] version of the standard left aspects of the language interface unspecified, which led to inconsistent behavior between compilers, or different optimization levels in a single compiler.\n\nProgramming languages should allow a user to specify a minimum precision for intermediate calculations of expressions for each radix. This is referred to as \"preferredWidth\" in the standard, and it should be possible to set this on a per block basis. Intermediate calculations within expressions should be calculated, and any temporaries saved, using the maximum of the width of the operands and the preferred width, if set. Thus, for instance, a compiler targeting [[x87]] floating-point hardware should have a means of specifying that intermediate calculations must use the [[Extended precision#IEEE 754 extended precision formats|double-extended format]]. The stored value of a variable must always be used when evaluating subsequent expressions, rather than any precursor from before rounding and assigning to the variable.\n\n=== Reproducibility ===\nThe IEEE 754-1985 allowed many variations in implementations (such as the encoding of some values and the detection of certain exceptions). IEEE 754-2008 has strengthened up many of these, but a few variations still remain (especially for binary formats).  The reproducibility clause recommends that language standards should provide a means to write reproducible programs (i.e., programs that will produce the same result in all implementations of a language) and describes what needs to be done to achieve reproducible results.\n\n== Character representation ==\nThe standard requires operations to convert between basic formats and ''external character sequence'' formats.<ref>{{Harvnb|IEEE 754|2008|loc=\u00a75.12}}.</ref> Conversions to and from a decimal character format are required for all formats. Conversion to an external character sequence must be such that conversion back using rounding to even will recover the original number. There is no requirement to preserve the payload of a quiet NaN or signaling NaN, and conversion from the external character sequence may turn a signaling NaN into a quiet NaN.\n\nThe original binary value will be preserved by converting to decimal and back again using:<ref>{{Harvnb|IEEE 754|2008|loc=\u00a75.12.2}}.</ref>\n* 5 decimal digits for binary16,\n* 9 decimal digits for binary32,\n* 17 decimal digits for binary64,\n* 36 decimal digits for binary128.\n\nFor other binary formats, the required number of decimal digits is\n\n: <math>1 + \\lceil p\\log_{10}(2)\\rceil,</math>\n\nwhere ''p'' is the number of significant bits in the binary format, e.g. 237 bits for binary256.\n\n(Note: as an implementation limit, correct rounding is only guaranteed for the number of decimal digits above plus 3 for the largest supported binary format. For instance, if binary32 is the largest supported binary format, then a conversion from a decimal external sequence with 12 decimal digits is guaranteed to be correctly rounded when converted to binary32; but conversion of a sequence of 13 decimal digits is not; however, the standard recommends that implementations impose no such limit.)\n\nWhen using a decimal floating-point format, the decimal representation will be preserved using:\n* 7 decimal digits for decimal32,\n* 16 decimal digits for decimal64,\n* 34 decimal digits for decimal128.\n\nAlgorithms, with code, for correctly rounded conversion from binary to decimal and decimal to binary are discussed by Gay,<ref>{{Cite journal |first=David M. |last=Gay |title=Correctly rounded binary-decimal and decimal-binary conversions |series=Numerical Analysis Manuscript |id=90-10 |publisher=AT&T Laboratories |location=Murry Hill, NJ, USA |date=November 30, 1990 |url=http://citeseer.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary?doi=10.1.1.31.4049 |doi= |ref=harv }}</ref> and for testing{{snd}} by Paxson and Kahan.<ref>{{Cite journal |title=A Program for Testing IEEE Decimal\u2013Binary Conversion |publisher= |series=Manuscript |first1=Vern |last1=Paxson |first2=William |last2=Kahan |author2-link=William Kahan |date=May 22, 1991 |doi= |ref=harv |citeseerx = 10.1.1.144.5889}}</ref>\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Binade]]\n* [[Coprocessor]]\n* [[C99#IEEE.C2.A0754 floating point support|C99]] for code examples demonstrating  access and use of IEEE 754 features.\n* [[Floating-point arithmetic#IEEE 754: floating point in modern computers|Floating-point arithmetic]], for history, design rationale and example usage of IEEE 754 features.\n* [[Fixed-point arithmetic]], for an alternative approach at computation with rational numbers (especially beneficial when the mantissa range is known, fixed, or bound at compile time).\n* [[IBM System z9]], the first CPU to implement IEEE 754-2008 decimal arithmetic (using hardware microcode).\n* [[IBM z10 (microprocessor)|IBM z10]], [[IBM z196]], [[IBM zEC12 (microprocessor)|IBM zEC12]], and [[IBM z13 (microprocessor)|IBM z13]], CPUs that implement IEEE 754-2008  decimal arithmetic fully in hardware.\n* [[ISO/IEC 10967]], language-independent arithmetic (LIA).\n* [[Minifloat]], low-precision binary floating-point formats following IEEE 754 principles.\n* [[POWER6]], [[POWER7]], and [[POWER8]] CPUs that implement IEEE 754-2008 decimal arithmetic fully in hardware.\n* [[strictfp]], a keyword in the [[Java (programming language)|Java programming language]] that restricts arithmetic to IEEE 754 single and double precision to ensure reproducibility across common hardware platforms.\n* [[Rounding#Table-maker's dilemma|The table-maker's dilemma]] for more about the correct rounding of functions.\n* [[Standard Apple Numerics Environment]]\n* [[Tapered floating point]]\n\n== Notes ==\n{{Reflist|group=\"lower-alpha\"}}\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n=== Standards ===\n* {{Cite book |title=IEEE Standard for Floating-Point Arithmetic |journal=IEEE STD 754-2008 |pages=1\u201370 |author=IEEE Computer Society |date=August 29, 2008 |publisher=IEEE |id=IEEE Std 754-2008 |doi=10.1109/IEEESTD.2008.4610935 |ref=CITEREFIEEE_7542008 |isbn=978-0-7381-5753-5 }}\n* {{Cite book |title=IEEE Standard for Floating-Point Arithmetic |journal=IEEE STD 754-2019 |pages=1\u201384 |author=IEEE Computer Society |date=July 22, 2019 |publisher=IEEE |id=IEEE Std 754-2019 |doi=10.1109/IEEESTD.2019.8766229  |isbn=978-1-5044-5924-2 }}\n* {{Cite book |title=ISO/IEC/IEEE 60559:2011 \u2014 Information technology \u2014 Microprocessor Systems \u2014 Floating-Point arithmetic |url=https://www.iso.org/standard/57469.html |publisher=Iso.org |pages=1\u201358 |date=June 2011}}\n\n=== Secondary references ===\n* [http://speleotrove.com/decimal Decimal floating-point] arithmetic, FAQs, bibliography, and links\n* [http://www.cygnus-software.com/papers/comparingfloats/comparingfloats.htm Comparing binary floats]\n* [http://babbage.cs.qc.cuny.edu/IEEE-754.old/References.xhtml IEEE 754 Reference Material]\n* [http://speleotrove.com/decimal/854mins.html IEEE 854-1987]&nbsp;\u2013 History and minutes\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20171230124220/http://grouper.ieee.org/groups/754/reading.html Supplementary readings for IEEE 754].
