For example, both C++ and C# allow programs to define operators to convert a value from one type to another in a semantically meaningful way. When a C++ compiler encounters such a conversion, it treats the operation just like a function call. In contrast, converting a value to the C type {{mono|void*}} is an unsafe operation that is invisible to the compiler.\n\n=== Pointers ===\nSome programming languages expose [[Pointer (computer programming)|pointers]] as if they were numeric values, and allow users to perform arithmetic on them.

In many such languages, it is easy to write programs that would be rejected by most static type-checkers.

Because of the wide divergence among these definitions, it is possible to defend claims about most programming languages that they are either strongly or weakly typed. For instance:\n\n* [[Java (programming language)|Java]], [[Pascal (programming language)|Pascal]], [[Ada (programming language)|Ada]] and [[C (programming language)|C]] require all [[Variable (programming)|variables]] to have a declared type, and support the use of explicit casts of arithmetic values to other arithmetic types. Java, C#, Ada and Pascal are sometimes said to be more strongly typed than C, a claim that is probably based on the fact that C supports more kinds of implicit conversions, and C also allows [[Pointer (computer programming)|pointer]] values to be explicitly cast while Java and Pascal do not. Java itself may be considered more strongly typed than Pascal as manners of evading the static type system in Java are controlled by the [[Java virtual machine]]'s type system. C# and VB.NET are similar to Java in that respect, though they allow disabling of dynamic type checking by explicitly putting code segments in an \"unsafe context\". Pascal's type system has been described as \"too strong\", because the size of an array or string is part of its type, making some programming tasks very difficult.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=7i8EAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA66&lpg=PA66&dq=pascal+type+system+%22too+strong%22#v=onepage&q=pascal%20type%20system%20%22too%20strong%22&f=false|title=InfoWorld|publisher=|accessdate=16 August 2015|date=1983-04-25}}</ref>\n* [[Smalltalk]], [[Perl]], [[Ruby (programming language)|Ruby]], [[Python (programming language)|Python]], and [[Self (programming language)|Self]] are all \"strongly typed\" in the sense that typing errors are prevented at runtime and they do little implicit [[type conversion]], but these languages make no use of static type checking: the compiler does not check or enforce type constraint rules.

Built in 1927-1929 in the [[Neo-Georgian architecture|Neo-Georgian]] and [[Colonial Revival architecture|Colonial Revival]] styles, it was designed by [[Benjamin Wistar Morris]].\n\nThe current structure is the third to be erected on the same plot, as the [[Bank of New York]] had previously erected buildings on the site in 1797 and 1858. The structure was erected during a period when many skyscrapers were being erected in Lower Manhattan. 48 Wall Street is designed with a multitude of neo-Georgian details. The lowest three stories, built over a raised [[basement]], were used as the banking floor and feature large arched windows on the second story, as well as [[pediment]]s over the entrances. The top of the building contains a [[cupola]] designed in the [[Federal architecture|Federal]] style and topped by a statue of an eagle.\n\nIn 2007, its former banking hall was modified to house the [[Museum of American Finance]], which closed in 2018 and was replaced by Will & Wall, a multi-purpose event venue.

Built in 1927-1929 in the [[Neo-Georgian architecture|Neo-Georgian]] and [[Colonial Revival architecture|Colonial Revival]] styles, it was designed by [[Benjamin Wistar Morris]].   \n\nThe current structure is the third to be erected on the same plot, as the [[Bank of New York]] had previously erected buildings on the site in 1797 and 1858. The structure was erected during a period when many skyscrapers were being erected in Lower Manhattan. 48 Wall Street is designed with a multitude of neo-Georgian details. The lowest three stories, built over a raised [[basement]], were used as the banking floor and feature large arched windows on the second story, as well as [[Pediment|pediments]] over the entrances. The top of the building contains a [[cupola]] designed in the [[Federal architecture|Federal]] style and topped by a statue of an eagle.  \n\nIn 2007, its former banking hall was modified to house the [[Museum of American Finance]], which closed in 2018 and was replaced by Will & Wall, a multi-purpose event venue. The building was added to the [[National Register of Historic Places]] in 2001, and was designated a city landmark by the [[New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission]] in 1998. \n\n==Site==\n48 Wall Street is located at the northeast corner of [[Wall Street|Wall]] and [[William Street (Manhattan)|William Streets]], facing Wall Street to the south and William Street to the west.<ref name=\":5\">{{Cite web|url=http://maps.nyc.gov/|title=NYCityMap|last=|first=|date=|website=NYC.gov|publisher=[[New York City Department of Information Technology and Telecommunications]]|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=March 20, 2020}}</ref>  The building has a frontage of {{Convert|99|ft||abbr=}} on Wall Street and {{Convert|125|ft||abbr=}} on William Street.<ref name=\"NYCL p. 4\" /><ref name=\"NPS p. 3\">{{harvnb|National Park Service|2003|ps=.|p=3}}</ref> The lot is largely rectangular with \"slightly irregular\" variations.

He was quoted saying \"hi eagle, can't come in\".\n\nThe attack began when Rodger stabbed three men to death in his apartment, apparently one by one on their arrival. Approximately three hours later, he drove to a [[sorority house]], but failed to gain access. He then shot three women outside; two of them died. He next drove past a nearby deli and shot to death a male student who was inside. He then began to speed through Isla Vista, [[Drive-by shooting|shooting and wounding several pedestrians]] and [[Vehicle-ramming attack|striking several others with his car]]. Rodger exchanged gunfire with police twice during the attack, receiving a non-fatal gunshot to the hip. The rampage ended when his car crashed into a parked vehicle and came to a stop. Police found him dead inside his car with a self-inflicted gunshot wound to the head.\n\nJust before driving to the sorority house, Rodger uploaded to [[YouTube]] a video titled \"Elliot Rodger's Retribution\", in which he outlined details of his upcoming attack and his motives. He explained that he wanted to punish women for rejecting him, and punish sexually active men because he envied them. After uploading the video, Rodger e-mailed a lengthy autobiographical manuscript to some of his acquaintances, his therapist and several family members. The document, titled \"My Twisted World: The Story of Elliot Rodger\", was made available on the Internet and became widely known as his [[manifesto]]. In it, he described his childhood, family conflicts, frustration over [[incel|inability to find a girlfriend]], his [[misogyny|hatred of women]], his contempt for couples (especially interracial couples), and his plans for what he described as \"retribution\".\n\n== Events ==\n=== Preparation ===\nIn September 2012, Rodger visited a [[shooting range]] to train in firing handguns.<ref name=CNN.Planned/> In November&nbsp;2012, he purchased his first handgun, a [[Glock 34]] pistol, in [[Goleta, California|Goleta]] after doing research on handguns, choosing it  as \"an efficient and highly accurate weapon\".<ref name=NYTimes.Amassed/> In early 2013, Rodger bought two additional handguns, both [[SIG Sauer P226]] pistols, writing that they were \"of a much higher quality than the Glock\" and \"a lot more efficient\".<ref name=CNN.Planned/> He purchased the weapons in [[Oxnard, California|Oxnard]] and [[Burbank, California]].<ref name=IntBusTimes.Police/>\n\nRodger claimed to have saved $5,000 of pocket money, which was given to him by his parents and grandmothers, in order to purchase the weapons and supplies that he needed for the attacks.<ref name=CNN.Planned/><ref name=Telegraph.Chamber/> [[Gun laws in California|Gun law]] experts have said that there was nothing in his known history that prevented him from making legal firearm purchases.<ref name=LATimes.Allowed/>\n\n=== Attacks ===\n[[File:2010 BMW 328i coupe -- NHTSA 01.jpg|thumb|right|A BMW 328i, similar to the car used by Rodger in the attacks.]]\nRodger began his attacks at his apartment on Seville Road, where three men were found dead inside.<ref name=Standard.Shooting/><ref name=CNN.Timeline/> Each victim had received multiple stab wounds,<ref name=Standard.Shooting/><ref name=CNN.Timeline/><ref name=USAToday.Identify/> and all had been killed approximately three hours before the shooting spree. Their bodies were found at 1:00&nbsp;a.m. following the shootings. They were identified as Rodger's roommates, Weihan Wang and Cheng Hong, and a friend of theirs named George Chen.<ref name=Sheriff.Summary/>\n\nFaint bloodstains in the main hallway of the apartment indicate at least one of the victims had been attacked as he entered the apartment. Authorities later said that the presence of a blood-soaked bath towel and paper towels in the bathroom suggest Rodger had attempted to clean the hallway after each murder. The bodies of Wang and Hong were found in their shared bedroom, whereas Chen's body was found in the bathroom.<ref name=Sheriff.Summary/> The positioning of the bodies suggested each victim had entered the apartment separately before being murdered, and that Rodger had made efforts to conceal the bodies of the first two victims by covering them with blankets, towels, and clothing.<ref name=DailyNexus.Report/> Police removed a knife, a hammer, and two [[machete]]s from the apartment,<ref name=NYTimes.Victims/><ref name=CNN.Roommates/> but they later determined that two knives recovered from a backpack found in Rodger's car were the weapons used to kill the apartment victims.<ref name=Sheriff.Summary/>\n\nLess than two hours preceding the shooting spree, Rodger went to a [[Starbucks]] coffee shop, where he purchased some coffee.<ref name=Sheriff.Summary/> He was later seen sitting in his car in the parking lot of his apartment building at about 8:30&nbsp;p.m.,<ref name=SBarbInd.Residents/> working on his laptop.

The shop was closed and unoccupied at the time, and no one was injured by the gunshot. He then arrived at the Isla Vista Deli Mart and fired several gunshots into the building, killing a student inside.<ref name=Sheriff.Summary/> Rodger's car was seen leaving the scene by four responding foot-patrol officers, but they did not identify him as the shooter and he escaped without incident.<ref name=NYTimes.Rampage/><ref name=CBS.Improvised/><ref name=Yahoo.Improvised/>\n\nRodger drove south on Embarcadero del Norte on the wrong side of the street, striking a pedestrian crossing the street and firing at two others on the sidewalk but missing both.

Rodger then exchanged fire with a sheriff's deputy, who was responding to a 9:27&nbsp;p.m. [[9-1-1]] call, and struck two pedestrians.<ref name=Sheriff.Summary/> Students at the Isla Vista Church, on Del Playa near Camino del Sur, were finishing a worship service at the time and heard gunfire.<ref name=CBS.Improvised/><ref name=Yahoo.Improvised/><ref name=KEYT.Shootings/><ref name=IVChurch.Ours/>\n\nTurning north on Camino del Sur, Rodger shot and wounded three people at Sabado Tarde Street, and also struck a skateboarder and two bicyclists with his car. Turning east on Sabado Tarde, he struck a skateboarder with his car and shot two other men at the intersection with Camino Pescadero.<ref name=Sheriff.Summary/> On Sabado Tarde near Little Acorn Park, he again exchanged gunfire, this time with three sheriff's deputies, and was shot in the left hip.<ref name=Standard.Shooting/><ref name=Yahoo.Aloof/><ref name=CBS.Improvised/><ref name=Yahoo.Improvised/><ref name=MarinIndJ.TeenInjured/>{{efn|group=lower-alpha|Sabado Tarde Road was where, in 2001, [[David Attias]] killed four pedestrians with his car.

A search of Rodger's car recovered three pistols, the knives used to kill the three men at the apartment, six&nbsp;empty ten-round magazines, and 548&nbsp;rounds of unspent ammunition, all found in ten-round magazines or ammunition boxes. A total of 83&nbsp;spent shell casings were recovered from the crime scenes, 55 of which were fired from Rodger and the remaining 28 from sheriff's deputies.<ref name=Sheriff.Summary/> Rodger purchased the 9&nbsp;mm guns legally in three different cities.<ref name=Standard.Shooting/><ref name=USAToday.Identify/><ref name=NYDailyNews.Slaughter/><ref name=CNN.Deputies/> [[Santa Barbara County Sheriff's Office|Santa Barbara County Sheriff]] Bill Brown said that there was video and written evidence suggesting the crime was premeditated and that preparations took over a year.<ref name=Yahoo.Gunman/><ref name=CNN.Deputies/><ref name=BBC.Gunman/> Officers from the Santa Barbara County Sheriff's Office and the [[Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives]] began searches of the separate homes of Rodger's mother and father in [[Los Angeles]].<ref name=CNN.Deputies/>\n\nThe media later reported the frantic attempt by Rodger's parents to intervene on the evening of the killings. After receiving a copy of the manifesto, Rodger's therapist phoned his mother. She checked his [[YouTube]] channel, where she found the \"Retribution\" video that he had uploaded minutes earlier. She contacted Rodger's father, who was horrified when he watched the full video. Rodger's father, his current wife, and Rodger's mother all started frantically driving from Los Angeles to [[Santa Barbara, California|Santa Barbara]] in two separate cars. During the drive, they called police in Isla Vista and arranged to meet them upon arrival.

Gun rights groups, including the National Rifle Association, opposed the legislation, citing that the rights of regular gun owners may be put in jeopardy due to a misunderstanding. The law went into effect in 2016.<ref name=ABC.Restriction/>\n\n=== Misogyny ===\nThe attack, videos, and written manifesto of Rodger sparked conversations about broader issues of [[violence against women]] and [[misogyny]] in society.<ref name=NewStatesman.Extremism/><ref name=NYTimes.Conversation/> Rodger indicated in online postings and YouTube videos that he would punish women for denying him sex and he would also punish men who had access to sex with women, as he did not.

Approximately three hours later, he drove to a [[sorority house]], but failed to gain access. He then shot three women outside; two of them died. He next drove past a nearby deli and shot to death a male student who was inside. He then began to speed through Isla Vista, [[Drive-by shooting|shooting and wounding several pedestrians]] and [[Vehicle-ramming attack|striking several others with his car]]. Rodger exchanged gunfire with police twice during the attack, receiving a non-fatal gunshot to the hip. The rampage ended when his car crashed into a parked vehicle and came to a stop. Police found him dead inside his car with a self-inflicted gunshot wound to the head.\n\nJust before driving to the sorority house, Rodger uploaded to [[YouTube]] a video titled \"Elliot Rodger's Retribution\", in which he outlined details of his upcoming attack and his motives. He explained that he wanted to punish women for rejecting him, and punish sexually active men because he envied them. After uploading the video, Rodger e-mailed a lengthy autobiographical manuscript to some of his acquaintances, his therapist and several family members. The document, titled \"My Twisted World: The Story of Elliot Rodger\", was made available on the Internet and became widely known as his [[manifesto]]. In it, he described his childhood, family conflicts, frustration over [[incel|inability to find a girlfriend]], his [[misogyny|hatred of women]], his contempt for couples (especially interracial couples), and his plans for what he described as \"retribution\".\n\n== Events ==\n=== Preparation ===\nIn September 2012, Rodger visited a [[shooting range]] to train in firing handguns.<ref name=CNN.Planned/> In November&nbsp;2012, he purchased his first handgun, a [[Glock 34]] pistol, in [[Goleta, California|Goleta]] after doing research on handguns, choosing it  as \"an efficient and highly accurate weapon\".<ref name=NYTimes.Amassed/> In early 2013, Rodger bought two additional handguns, both [[SIG Sauer P226]] pistols, writing that they were \"of a much higher quality than the Glock\" and \"a lot more efficient\".<ref name=CNN.Planned/> He purchased the weapons in [[Oxnard, California|Oxnard]] and [[Burbank, California]].<ref name=IntBusTimes.Police/>\n\nRodger claimed to have saved $5,000 of pocket money, which was given to him by his parents and grandmothers, in order to purchase the weapons and supplies that he needed for the attacks.<ref name=CNN.Planned/><ref name=Telegraph.Chamber/> [[Gun laws in California|Gun law]] experts have said that there was nothing in his known history that prevented him from making legal firearm purchases.<ref name=LATimes.Allowed/>\n\n=== Attacks ===\n[[File:2010 BMW 328i coupe -- NHTSA 01.jpg|thumb|right|A BMW 328i, similar to the car used by Rodger in the attacks.]]\nRodger began his attacks at his apartment on Seville Road, where three men were found dead inside.<ref name=Standard.Shooting/><ref name=CNN.Timeline/> Each victim had received multiple stab wounds,<ref name=Standard.Shooting/><ref name=CNN.Timeline/><ref name=USAToday.Identify/> and all had been killed approximately three hours before the shooting spree. Their bodies were found at 1:00&nbsp;a.m. following the shootings. They were identified as Rodger's roommates, Weihan Wang and Cheng Hong, and a friend of theirs named George Chen.<ref name=Sheriff.Summary/>\n\nFaint bloodstains in the main hallway of the apartment indicate at least one of the victims had been attacked as he entered the apartment. Authorities later said that the presence of a blood-soaked bath towel and paper towels in the bathroom suggest Rodger had attempted to clean the hallway after each murder. The bodies of Wang and Hong were found in their shared bedroom, whereas Chen's body was found in the bathroom.<ref name=Sheriff.Summary/> The positioning of the bodies suggested each victim had entered the apartment separately before being murdered, and that Rodger had made efforts to conceal the bodies of the first two victims by covering them with blankets, towels, and clothing.<ref name=DailyNexus.Report/> Police removed a knife, a hammer, and two [[machete]]s from the apartment,<ref name=NYTimes.Victims/><ref name=CNN.Roommates/> but they later determined that two knives recovered from a backpack found in Rodger's car were the weapons used to kill the apartment victims.<ref name=Sheriff.Summary/>\n\nLess than two hours preceding the shooting spree, Rodger went to a [[Starbucks]] coffee shop, where he purchased some coffee.<ref name=Sheriff.Summary/> He was later seen sitting in his car in the parking lot of his apartment building at about 8:30&nbsp;p.m.,<ref name=SBarbInd.Residents/> working on his laptop. He uploaded the \"Retribution\" video at 9:17&nbsp;p.m. and sent his manifesto e-mail at 9:18&nbsp;p.m.<ref name=SBarbInd.CheckUp/>\n\nRodger drove to the [[Alpha Phi]] [[sorority house]] at Embarcadero del Norte and Segovia Road near the [[University of California, Santa Barbara]] (UCSB).{{efn|group=lower-alpha|In his \"Retribution\" video, Rodger said he would enter the \"hottest sorority house of UCSB\" and kill every woman inside.<ref name=NYDailyNews.Retribution/> In his manifesto, he had identified that sorority as [[Alpha Phi]].<ref name=DocCloud.Manifesto/>{{rp|132}}}} He knocked on the front door for a few minutes.<ref name=Sheriff.Details/> After no one answered, Rodger began shooting people who were nearby.

The shop was closed and unoccupied at the time, and no one was injured by the gunshot. He then arrived at the Isla Vista Deli Mart and fired several gunshots into the building, killing a student inside.<ref name=Sheriff.Summary/> Rodger's car was seen leaving the scene by four responding foot-patrol officers, but they did not identify him as the shooter and he escaped without incident.<ref name=NYTimes.Rampage/><ref name=CBS.Improvised/><ref name=Yahoo.Improvised/>\n\nRodger drove south on Embarcadero del Norte on the wrong side of the street, striking a pedestrian crossing the street and firing at two others on the sidewalk but missing both. Embarcadero del Norte curves near a [[7-Eleven]] convenience store, forming \"The Loop\", where Rodger continued firing, hitting a couple exiting a pizzeria and then a female bicyclist.<ref name=Sheriff.Summary/><ref name=Yahoo.Gunman/><ref name=NBC.Deli/><ref name=ABC.Stabbing/><ref name=KEYT.Shootings/><ref name=NYDailyNews.Slaughter/> He drove south on El Embarcadero and shot at and missed a woman,<ref name=KEYT.Survivor/> turned east on [[Del Playa Drive]], then made a [[U-turn]] and drove west. Rodger then exchanged fire with a sheriff's deputy, who was responding to a 9:27&nbsp;p.m. [[9-1-1]] call, and struck two pedestrians.<ref name=Sheriff.Summary/> Students at the Isla Vista Church, on Del Playa near Camino del Sur, were finishing a worship service at the time and heard gunfire.<ref name=CBS.Improvised/><ref name=Yahoo.Improvised/><ref name=KEYT.Shootings/><ref name=IVChurch.Ours/>\n\nTurning north on Camino del Sur, Rodger shot and wounded three people at Sabado Tarde Street, and also struck a skateboarder and two bicyclists with his car. Turning east on Sabado Tarde, he struck a skateboarder with his car and shot two other men at the intersection with Camino Pescadero.<ref name=Sheriff.Summary/> On Sabado Tarde near Little Acorn Park, he again exchanged gunfire, this time with three sheriff's deputies, and was shot in the left hip.<ref name=Standard.Shooting/><ref name=Yahoo.Aloof/><ref name=CBS.Improvised/><ref name=Yahoo.Improvised/><ref name=MarinIndJ.TeenInjured/>{{efn|group=lower-alpha|Sabado Tarde Road was where, in 2001, [[David Attias]] killed four pedestrians with his car.

A search of Rodger's car recovered three pistols, the knives used to kill the three men at the apartment, six&nbsp;empty ten-round magazines, and 548&nbsp;rounds of unspent ammunition, all found in ten-round magazines or ammunition boxes. A total of 83&nbsp;spent shell casings were recovered from the crime scenes, 55 of which were fired from Rodger and the remaining 28 from sheriff's deputies.<ref name=Sheriff.Summary/> Rodger purchased the 9&nbsp;mm guns legally in three different cities.<ref name=Standard.Shooting/><ref name=USAToday.Identify/><ref name=NYDailyNews.Slaughter/><ref name=CNN.Deputies/> [[Santa Barbara County Sheriff's Office|Santa Barbara County Sheriff]] Bill Brown said that there was video and written evidence suggesting the crime was premeditated and that preparations took over a year.<ref name=Yahoo.Gunman/><ref name=CNN.Deputies/><ref name=BBC.Gunman/> Officers from the Santa Barbara County Sheriff's Office and the [[Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives]] began searches of the separate homes of Rodger's mother and father in [[Los Angeles]].<ref name=CNN.Deputies/>\n\nThe media later reported the frantic attempt by Rodger's parents to intervene on the evening of the killings. After receiving a copy of the manifesto, Rodger's therapist phoned his mother. She checked his [[YouTube]] channel, where she found the \"Retribution\" video that he had uploaded minutes earlier. She contacted Rodger's father, who was horrified when he watched the full video. Rodger's father, his current wife, and Rodger's mother all started frantically driving from Los Angeles to [[Santa Barbara, California|Santa Barbara]] in two separate cars. During the drive, they called police in Isla Vista and arranged to meet them upon arrival.

Gun rights groups, including the National Rifle Association, opposed the legislation, citing that the rights of regular gun owners may be put in jeopardy due to a misunderstanding. The law went into effect in 2016.<ref name=ABC.Restriction/>\n\n=== Misogyny ===\nThe attack, videos, and written manifesto of Rodger sparked conversations about broader issues of [[violence against women]] and [[misogyny]] in society.<ref name=NewStatesman.Extremism/><ref name=NYTimes.Conversation/> Rodger indicated in online postings and YouTube videos that he would punish women for denying him sex and he would also punish men who had access to sex with women, as he did not.
