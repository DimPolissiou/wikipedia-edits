An ally of [[Roundhead|Parliamentary]] leader [[John Pym]], and cousin to [[Oliver Cromwell]], he was one of the [[Five Members]] whose attempted arrest in January 1642 sparked the [[First English Civil War]].\n\nAfter war began in August 1642, Hampden raised an infantry regiment, and died of wounds received at the [[Battle of Chalgrove Field]] on 18 June 1643. His loss was considered a serious blow, largely because he was one of the few Parliamentary leaders able to hold the different factions together. \n\nHis death in 1643 meant he avoided the bitter internal debates later in the war, the execution of [[Charles I of England|Charles I]] in 1649, and establishment of [[The Protectorate]]. As a result, he is considered a less complex figure than either Cromwell, or even Pym; in 1841, his statue was erected in the [[Palace of Westminster]], to represent the Parliamentary cause.{{efn|The Royalist chosen was another moderate, [[Lucius_Cary,_2nd_Viscount_Falkland|Viscount Falkland]], killed at [[First_Battle_of_Newbury|Newbury]] three months later.}}    \n\nA reputation for honest, principled, and patriotic opposition to arbitrary rule also made him a popular figure in [[North America]]. Prior to the 1774 [[American Revolution]], [[Benjamin_Franklin|Franklin]] and [[John_Adams|Adams]] were among those who referenced him to justify their cause.{{sfn|Jansson|2009|pp=11-12}}\n\n==Biographical==\n[[File:Gt Hampden Church.jpg|thumb|left|[[Great_and_Little_Hampden|Great Hampden church]], where Hampden and other family members were baptised, and later buried]]\nJohn Hampden was born around June 1595, probably in [[London]], eldest son of William Hampden, (1570-1597), and Elizabeth Cromwell, (1574-1664); he had a younger brother, Richard, 1596 to 1659.{{sfn|Thompson|2010}}  \n\nThe Hampden family had been established in [[Buckinghamshire]] for many years; William was a lawyer, and [[Member of Parliament]] for [[East_Looe_(UK_Parliament_constituency)|East Looe]] in 1593.{{sfn|WJJ|1981}} He died in April 1597; his cousin, William Hampden of Ennington, was appointed executor, but became involved in a bitter legal dispute with Elizabeth.{{sfn|Russell|2008}}\n\nIn 1619, John married Elizabeth Symeon, and prior to her death in 1631, they had nine children.

It covered a variety of [[Christian_theology|doctrines]], of which [[Calvinism|Calvinists]] such as Hampden were the most prominent; it connected him to a network that included [[Richard_Knightley_(died_1639)|Sir Richard Knightley]], [[William_Fiennes,_1st_Viscount_Saye_and_Sele|Lord Saye]], and [[John_Preston_(priest)|John Preston]].{{sfn|Russell|2008}} \n\nIn 1621, Hampden was elected [[Member of Parliament]] for [[Grampound (UK Parliament constituency)|Grampound]], a [[Rotten_and_pocket_boroughs|rotten borough]] in [[Cornwall]]. This is thought to have been through the influence of the local magnate, [[John_Arundell_(born_1576)|John Arundell]]; a good example of the complexity of the period, Arundell opposed [[Ship Money]] in 1636, but held [[Pendennis Castle]] for [[Charles_I_of_England|Charles I]] until 1646.{{sfn|Duffin|Hunneyball|2010}}  \n[[File:John Pym.jpg|thumb|left|[[John Pym]]; Hampden joined his attack on [[Roger Maynwaring]] and [[Robert Sibthorpe]] in 1628]]\nHe financed the cost of restoring Parliamentary representation to [[Wendover (UK Parliament constituency)|Wendover]] in 1624, a seat he held until 1629. The [[2nd_Parliament_of_King_Charles_I|1626 Parliament]] refused taxes without an agreement to [[Impeachment_in_the_United_Kingdom|impeach]] Charles' favourite, the [[George_Villiers,_1st_Duke_of_Buckingham|Duke of Buckingham]], a military commander notorious for inefficiency, combined with extravagance; only his assassination in August 1628 prevented a second attempt.{{sfn|Ferris|Hunneyball|2010}} \n\nRather than comply, Charles dissolved Parliament, and imposed a forced loan; over 70 individuals were jailed for not contributing, including Hampden's cousin, Sir Edmund Hampden.{{sfn|Hostettler|1997|p=127}} Like many others, Hampden also refused to subscribe; and reducing the income from the loans. Charles was forced to call a [[3rd_Parliament_of_King_Charles_I|1628 Parliament]] in March 1627, which resulted in \"a preponderance of MPs opposed to the King\", including Selden, Coke, [[John Pym]] and a young [[Oliver Cromwell]].{{sfn|Hostettler|1997|p=127}} released to attend the [[3rd_Parliament_of_King_Charles_I|1628 Parliament]], he supported [[John Pym]] and others in the Parliamentary attack on [[Roger Maynwaring]] and [[Robert Sibthorpe]].{{sfn|Russell|2008}} \n\nIn the 17th century, religion and politics were considered interdependent; 'good government' required 'true religion', and alterations in one, implied alterations in the other.{{efn|This view was summarised by Hampden in the debate on the [[Petition of Right]]; \"Here is 1, an innovation of religion suspected; is it not high time to take it to heart and acquaint his Majesty? 2ly, alteration of government; can you forbear when it goes no less than the subversion of the whole state? 3ly, hemmed in with enemies; is it now a time to be silent, and not to show to his Majesty that a man that has so much power uses none of it to help us?

''We Won't Pay!: A Tax Resistance Reader'' {{ISBN|1-4348-9825-3}} pp. 9\u201316</ref> But it is hardly possible that even resistance to ship money would have so distinguished him but for the mingled massiveness and modesty of his character, his dislike of all pretences in himself or others, his brave contempt of danger, and his charitable readiness to shield others as far as possible from the evil consequences of their actions. Nor was he wanting in that skill which enabled him to influence men towards the ends at which he aimed, and which was spoken of as subtlety by those who disliked his ends.\n\n===Committee work===\nDuring these first parliaments Hampden did not, so far as we know, speak in public debate, but he was increasingly employed in [[committee]] work, for which he seems to have had a special aptitude. In 1626 he took an active part in the preparation of the charges against [[George Villiers, 1st Duke of Buckingham|Buckingham]]. In January 1627 he was bound over to answer at the council board for his refusal to pay the forced loan.  Later in the year he was committed to the gatehouse, and then sent into confinement in [[Hampshire]], from which he was liberated just before the meeting of the third parliament of the reign, in which he once more rendered useful but unobtrusive assistance to his leaders.\n\nWhen the breach came in 1629 Hampden was found corresponding with the imprisoned Eliot, discussing with him the prospects of the [[Massachusetts Bay Colony]]. Hampden was one of the persons to whom the [[Robert Rich, 2nd Earl of Warwick|Earl of Warwick]] granted land in [[Connecticut]] in what was then referred to as the [[Saybrook Colony]] and today as [[Old Saybrook, Connecticut]]. While some claim there is no foundation but anecdote that Hampden attempted emigration to the colonies with Cromwell, others assert that Cromwell and other future architects of the English Civil War, including Hampden, may have been close to moving to America in the 1630s. The author [[Kevin Phillips (political commentator)|Kevin Phillips]] points out that, \"Even in the 1770s, residents of [[Old Saybrook]] still talked about which prominent [[Member of Parliament|Parliamentarian]] was to have had which town lot.\"<ref>Alfred A. Young, \"English Plebeian Culture an 18th Century American Radicalism\" in Margret Jacob and James Jacob, eds., \"The Origin of Anglo-American Radicalism\" 9New Jersey, Humanitarian Press International, 19910 Page 195,</ref>\n\nIt was not until 1637, however, that his resistance to the payment of ship money gained him wide fame. Seven out of the twelve judges sided against him, but the connection between the rights of property and the parliamentary system became firmly established in the popular mind. The tax had been justified, says Clarendon, who expresses his admiration at Hampden's \"rare temper and modesty\" at this crisis, \"upon such grounds and reasons as every standerby was able to swear was not law\" (''Hist''. i. 150,  vii. 82).\n\n===Short Parliament===\nIn the Short Parliament that started on 13 April 1640, Hampden stood forth amongst the leaders. He guided the House in the debate on 4 May in its opposition to the grant of twelve subsidies in return for the surrender of ship money. Parliament was dissolved the next day, and on 6 May an unsuccessful search was made among the papers of Hampden and of other chiefs of the party to discover incriminating correspondence with the [[Scotland|Scots]]. During the eventful months which followed, when [[Thomas Wentworth, Earl of Strafford|Strafford]] was striving in vain to force England, in spite of its visible reluctance, to support the king in his [[Bishops' Wars|Scottish war]], rumour has much to tell of Hampden's activity in rousing opposition. It is likely enough that the rumour is in the main true, but we are not possessed of any satisfactory evidence on the subject.\n\n===Long Parliament===\nIn the [[Long Parliament]], though Hampden was by no means a frequent speaker, it is possible to trace his course with sufficient distinctness. His power consisted in his personal influence, and as a debater rather than as an orator.  \"He was not a man of many words,\" says Clarendon, \"and rarely began the discourse or made the first entrance upon any business that was assumed, but a very weighty speaker, and after he had heard a full debate and observed how the House was likely to be inclined, took up the argument and shortly and clearly and craftily so stated it that he commonly conducted it to the conclusion he desired; and if he found he could not do that, he never was without the dexterity to divert the debate to another time, and to prevent the determining anything in the negative which might prove inconvenient in the future\" (''Hist''. iii. 31). Unwearied in attendance upon committees, he was in all things ready to second Pym, whom he plainly regarded as his leader.\n\nHampden was one of the eight managers of Strafford's prosecution. Like Pym, he was in favour of the more legal and regular procedure by [[impeachment]] rather than by [[attainder]], which at the later stage was supported by the majority of the Commons; and through his influence a compromise was effected by which, while an attainder was subsequently adopted, Strafford's counsel were heard as in the case of an impeachment, and thus a serious breach between the two Houses, which threatened to cause the breakdown of the whole proceedings, was averted.\n\n===Debate on episcopacy===\n[[File:John Hampden Statue.jpg|left|thumb|Statue of John Hampden in Market Square, [[Aylesbury]], Buckinghamshire]]\n\nThere was another point on which there was no agreement. A large minority wished to retain [[episcopacy]], and to keep the [[Book of Common Prayer]] unaltered, whilst the majority were at least willing to consider the question of abolishing the one and modifying the other. On this subject the parties which ultimately divided the House and the country itself were fully formed as early as 8 February 1641. It is enough to say that Hampden fully shared in the counsels of the opponents of episcopacy. It is not that he was a theoretical [[Presbyterianism|Presbyterian]], but the [[bishop]]s had been in his days so fully engaged in the imposition of ceremonies regarded by the [[Puritans]] as verging on [[Papacy]] that it was difficult, if not impossible, to dissociate them from the cause in which they were embarked.  Closely connected with Hampden's distrust of the bishops was his distrust of monarchy as it then existed. The dispute about the church therefore soon attained the form of an attack upon [[monarchy]], and, when the majority of the [[House of Lords]] arrayed itself on the side of episcopacy and the Prayer Book, of an attack upon the House of Lords as well.\n\nNo serious importance therefore can be attached to the offers of advancement made from time to time to Hampden and his friends. Charles would gladly have given them office if they had been ready to desert their principles. Every day Hampden's conviction grew stronger that Charles would never surrender a position which he had taken up. In August 1641 Hampden was one of the four commissioners who attended Charles in Scotland, and the king's conduct there, connected with such events as the \"Incident\", must have proved to a man far less sagacious than Hampden that the time for compromise had gone by. He was therefore a warm supporter of the [[Grand Remonstrance]], and was marked out as one of the five impeached members, known thenceforth in history as the [[Five Members]] (the others being [[John Pym]], [[Arthur Haselrig]], [[Denzil Holles, 1st Baron Holles|Denzil Holles]] and [[William Strode]]) whose attempted arrest brought at last the opposing parties into open collision. In the angry scene which arose on the proposal to print the Grand Remonstrance, it was Hampden's personal intervention which prevented an actual conflict, and it was after the impeachment had been attempted that Hampden laid down the two conditions under which resistance to the king became the duty of a good subject.  Those conditions were:\n*an attack upon religion and\n*an attack upon the fundamental laws.\n\nThere can be no doubt that Hampden fully believed that both those conditions were fulfilled at the opening of 1642.\n\n==English Civil War==\n\nWhen the [[English Civil War]] began, Hampden was appointed a member of the [[ Committee of Safety (England) #1642\u20131644 | Committee of Safety]], levied a [[regiment]] of Buckinghamshire men for the parliamentary cause, and in his capacity of deputy-lieutenant carried out the parliamentary [[Militia Ordinance]] in the county. In the earlier operations of the war he bore himself gallantly and well. He took no actual part in the [[Battle of Edgehill]] (23 October 1642). His troops in the rear,  however, arrested [[Prince Rupert of the Rhine]]'s charge at [[Kineton]], and he urged Essex to renew the attack here, and also after the disaster at [[Battle of Brentford (1642)|Brentford]]. In the spring of 1643, Hampden's regiment took part in the [[siege of Reading]], which surrendered on 27 April. Although Essex intended to advance on the King's headquarters at Oxford, he remained at Reading because of widespread sickness in the army, a shortage of cavalry and to await a paymaster with funds to pay his troops. In early June 1643 he moved his army to Thame making his headquarters there on 10 June.\n\nBut it is not on his skill as a regimental officer that Hampden's fame rests. In war as in peace his distinction lay in his power of disentangling the essential part from the non-essential. In the previous constitutional struggle he had seen that the one thing necessary was to establish the supremacy of the [[British House of Commons|House of Commons]].  In the military struggle which followed he saw, as Cromwell saw afterwards, that the one thing necessary was to beat the enemy.  He protested at once against Essex's hesitations and compromises.  In the formation of the confederacy of the six associated counties, which was to supply a basis for Cromwell's operations, he took an active part.  His influence was felt alike in parliament and in the field but he was not in supreme command, and he had none of that impatience which often leads able men to fail in the execution of orders of which they disapprove.\n\n===Death===\n[[File:Hampden's monument, Chalgrove.jpg|thumb|Hampden's Monument, [[Chalgrove]]. A monument to John Hampden, who was mortally wounded 550 yards north of here in 1643 whilst fighting in the English Civil War on [[Battle of Chalgrove Field|Chalgrove Field]]]]\n\nOn the night of 17 June 1643, [[Prince Rupert]] sortied on a raid out of Oxford to capture the Parliamentarian army's paymaster, but while that failed, did succeed the next morning in overwhelming two of Essex's small garrison outposts at [[Postcombe]] and [[Chinnor]]. Hampden rode as a volunteer with 1,100 cavalry and dragoons commanded by Sir [[Philip Stapleton]] in pursuit of Rupert, with the intention of delaying him long enough for a larger force from Essex's main army to cut off his retreat. Rupert halted his own cavalry at [[Chalgrove]] to ambush the pursuit and allow 800 less mobile troops to escape via the ford of the [[River Thame]] at [[Chiselhampton]]. During the ensuing [[Battle of Chalgrove Field]], Hampden was mortally wounded (some sources claim in the shoulder by two carbine balls, others by fragments from his own pistol exploding<ref>Britannica 1911 (article \"HAMPDEN, JOHN\") \"two carbine balls\".

Sir Robert assured him that he bought them in Paris from an eminent maker and proved them himself. It appeared on examining the other pistol that it was loaded to the muzzle with several supernumerary charges, owning to the carelessness of a servant. He was ordered to see that the pistols were loaded every morning which he did but without drawing the former charge.\" An exhumation of Hampden's body in 1828 showed that there was no damage to the shoulder but his 'right hand was shattered by the bursting of his pistol, and death probably ensued from [[tetanus|lockjaw]] arising out of extensive injury to the nervous system'.<ref>Frederick George Lee, The History, description and antiquities of the Prebendal Church of the Blessed Virgin Mary of Thame in the county and diocese of Oxford.

During the preceding winter, Hampden had associated himself with John Pym's \"Middle Group\" in Parliament, which opposed any peace moves to the King except on favorable terms. At the same time he had worked to moderate the militancy of the parliamentary \"War Party\". Although Hampden was privately critical of Essex for not aggressively attacking after avoiding defeat at Edgehill and the standoff at [[Battle of Turnham Green|Turnham Green]], he remained publicly loyal and helped Essex resist the criticisms of the War Party. His death took with it a key link between the factions. Hearing of his death, the Member of Parliament [[Anthony Nicholl]] pronounced: \"Never Kingdom received a greater loss in one subject, never a man a truer and faithful friend.\"<ref>\"Selected Readings in English History\". p. 265.

him a national figure. An ally of [[Roundhead|Parliamentary]] leader [[John Pym]], and cousin to [[Oliver Cromwell]], he was one of the [[Five Members]] whose attempted arrest in January 1642 sparked the [[First English Civil War]].\n\nAfter war began in August 1642, Hampden raised an infantry regiment, and died of wounds received at the [[Battle of Chalgrove Field]] on 18 June 1643. His loss was considered a serious blow, largely because he was one of the few Parliamentary leaders able to hold the different factions together. \n\nHis death in 1643 meant he avoided the bitter internal debates later in the war, the execution of [[Charles I of England|Charles I]] in 1649, and establishment of [[The Protectorate]]. As a result, he is considered a less complex figure than either Cromwell, or even Pym; in 1841, his statue was erected in the [[Palace of Westminster]], to represent the Parliamentary cause.{{efn|The Royalist chosen was another moderate, [[Lucius_Cary,_2nd_Viscount_Falkland|Viscount Falkland]], killed at [[First_Battle_of_Newbury|Newbury]] three months later.}}    \n\nA reputation for honest, principled, and patriotic opposition to arbitrary rule also made him a popular figure in [[North America]]. Prior to the 1774 [[American Revolution]], [[Benjamin_Franklin|Franklin]] and [[John_Adams|Adams]] were among those who referenced him to justify their cause.{{sfn|Jansson|2009|pp=11-12}}\n\n==Biographical==\n[[File:Gt Hampden Church.jpg|thumb|left|[[Great_and_Little_Hampden|Great Hampden church]], where Hampden and other family members were baptised, and later buried]]\nJohn Hampden was born around June 1595, probably in [[London]], eldest son of William Hampden, (1570-1597), and Elizabeth Cromwell, (1574-1664); he had a younger brother, Richard, 1596 to 1659.{{sfn|Thompson|2010}}  \n\nThe Hampden family had been established in [[Buckinghamshire]] for many years; William was a lawyer, and [[Member of Parliament]] for [[East_Looe_(UK_Parliament_constituency)|East Looe]] in 1593.{{sfn|WJJ|1981}} He died in April 1597; his cousin, William Hampden of Ennington, was appointed executor, but became involved in a bitter legal dispute with Elizabeth.{{sfn|Russell|2008}}\n\nIn 1619, John married Elizabeth Symeon, and prior to her death in 1631, they had nine children. Seven survived into adulthood Ann (1616-1701), Elizabeth (1619-1643), John (1621-1642), William (died 1675), Ruth (1628-1687), Mary (1630-1689), and [[Richard_Hampden|Richard]] (1631-1695), [[Chancellor of the Exchequer]] under [[William III of England|William III]].<ref>{{cite web |title=John Hampden |url=https://www.geni.com/people/John-Hampden-Patriae-Pater/6000000003266399664 |website=Geni.com |accessdate=9 April 2020}}</ref> In 1640, he married Letitia Knollys (1591-1666); they had no children.   \n\n==Career==\nIn 1610, he graduated from [[Magdalen College, Oxford]]; as legal training was then considered part of a gentleman's education, he attended the [[Inner Temple]] from 1613 to 1615. \n\nThe Hampden family were [[Puritan]]s, a term then used for anyone who wanted to reform, or 'purify', the [[Church of England]]. It covered a variety of [[Christian_theology|doctrines]], of which [[Calvinism|Calvinists]] such as Hampden were the most prominent; it connected him to a network that included [[Richard_Knightley_(died_1639)|Sir Richard Knightley]], [[William_Fiennes,_1st_Viscount_Saye_and_Sele|Lord Saye]], and [[John_Preston_(priest)|John Preston]].{{sfn|Russell|2008}} \n\nIn 1621, Hampden was elected [[Member of Parliament]] for [[Grampound (UK Parliament constituency)|Grampound]], a [[Rotten_and_pocket_boroughs|rotten borough]] in [[Cornwall]]. This is thought to have been through the influence of the local magnate, [[John_Arundell_(born_1576)|John Arundell]]; a good example of the complexity of the period, Arundell opposed [[Ship Money]] in 1636, but held [[Pendennis Castle]] for [[Charles_I_of_England|Charles I]] until 1646.{{sfn|Duffin, Hunneyball|2010}}  \n[[File:John Pym.jpg|thumb|left|[[John Pym]]; Hampden joined his attack on [[Roger Maynwaring]] and [[Robert Sibthorpe]] in 1628]]\nHe financed the cost of restoring Parliamentary representation to [[Wendover (UK Parliament constituency)|Wendover]] in 1624, a seat he held until 1629. The [[2nd_Parliament_of_King_Charles_I|1626 Parliament]] refused taxes without an agreement to [[Impeachment_in_the_United_Kingdom|impeach]] Charles' favourite, the [[George_Villiers,_1st_Duke_of_Buckingham|Duke of Buckingham]], a military commander notorious for inefficiency, combined with extravagance; only his assassination in August 1628 prevented a second attempt.{{sfn|Ferris|Hunneyball|2010}} \n\nRather than comply, Charles dissolved Parliament, and imposed a forced loan; over 70 individuals were jailed for not contributing, including Hampden's cousin, Sir Edmund Hampden.{{sfn|Hostettler|1997|p=127}} Like many others, Hampden also refused to subscribe; and reducing the income from the loans. Charles was forced to call a [[3rd_Parliament_of_King_Charles_I|1628 Parliament]] in March 1627, which resulted in \"a preponderance of MPs opposed to the King\", including Selden, Coke, [[John Pym]] and a young [[Oliver Cromwell]].{{sfn|Hostettler|1997|p=127}} released to attend the [[3rd_Parliament_of_King_Charles_I|1628 Parliament]], he supported [[John Pym]] and others in the Parliamentary attack on [[Roger Maynwaring]] and [[Robert Sibthorpe]].{{sfn|Russell|2008}} \n\nIn the 17th century, religion and politics were considered interdependent; 'good government' required 'true religion', and alterations in one, implied alterations in the other.{{efn|This view was summarised by Hampden in the debate on the [[Petition of Right]]; \"Here is 1, an innovation of religion suspected; is it not high time to take it to heart and acquaint his Majesty? 2ly, alteration of government; can you forbear when it goes no less than the subversion of the whole state? 3ly, hemmed in with enemies; is it now a time to be silent, and not to show to his Majesty that a man that has so much power uses none of it to help us? If he be no papist, papists are friends and kindred to him.\"{{sfn|Keeler, Janssen Cole|1997|pp=121-122}}}} The two published [[sermons]], supporting the Caroline precepts of the [[divine right of kings]], and [[passive obedience]]; although censured for preaching against the established English constitution, Charles pardoned them, and made Sibthorpe a royal [[chaplain]].{{sfn|Little|2008|p=33}} \n\nand in 1629, he dissolved Parliament, initiating the period of [[Personal Rule]] that continued until 1640\n\nIn April 1640 he was elected MP for [[Buckinghamshire (UK Parliament constituency)|Buckinghamshire]] in the [[Short Parliament]] and was re-elected MP for Buckinghamshire for the [[Long Parliament]] in November 1640.<ref name=Willis>{{Cite Notitia Parliamentaria|converted=1|part=2|pages=229\u2013239}}</ref> He sat until his death in 1643.\n\nIn the early days of his parliamentary career, he was content to be overshadowed by [[John Eliot (statesman)|John Eliot]], as in its later days he was content to be overshadowed by [[John Pym]] and to be commanded by the [[Robert Devereux, 3rd Earl of Essex|Earl of Essex]].\n\n\n\n===Views on ship money===\nSomething of Hampden's fame no doubt is owing to the position which he took up as the opponent of [[ship money]].<ref>Gross, David (ed.) ''We Won't Pay!: A Tax Resistance Reader'' {{ISBN|1-4348-9825-3}} pp. 9\u201316</ref> But it is hardly possible that even resistance to ship money would have so distinguished him but for the mingled massiveness and modesty of his character, his dislike of all pretences in himself or others, his brave contempt of danger, and his charitable readiness to shield others as far as possible from the evil consequences of their actions. Nor was he wanting in that skill which enabled him to influence men towards the ends at which he aimed, and which was spoken of as subtlety by those who disliked his ends.\n\n===Committee work===\nDuring these first parliaments Hampden did not, so far as we know, speak in public debate, but he was increasingly employed in [[committee]] work, for which he seems to have had a special aptitude. In 1626 he took an active part in the preparation of the charges against [[George Villiers, 1st Duke of Buckingham|Buckingham]]. In January 1627 he was bound over to answer at the council board for his refusal to pay the forced loan.  Later in the year he was committed to the gatehouse, and then sent into confinement in [[Hampshire]], from which he was liberated just before the meeting of the third parliament of the reign, in which he once more rendered useful but unobtrusive assistance to his leaders.\n\nWhen the breach came in 1629 Hampden was found corresponding with the imprisoned Eliot, discussing with him the prospects of the [[Massachusetts Bay Colony]]. Hampden was one of the persons to whom the [[Robert Rich, 2nd Earl of Warwick|Earl of Warwick]] granted land in [[Connecticut]] in what was then referred to as the [[Saybrook Colony]] and today as [[Old Saybrook, Connecticut]]. While some claim there is no foundation but anecdote that Hampden attempted emigration to the colonies with Cromwell, others assert that Cromwell and other future architects of the English Civil War, including Hampden, may have been close to moving to America in the 1630s. The author [[Kevin Phillips (political commentator)|Kevin Phillips]] points out that, \"Even in the 1770s, residents of [[Old Saybrook]] still talked about which prominent [[Member of Parliament|Parliamentarian]] was to have had which town lot.\"<ref>Alfred A. Young, \"English Plebeian Culture an 18th Century American Radicalism\" in Margret Jacob and James Jacob, eds., \"The Origin of Anglo-American Radicalism\" 9New Jersey, Humanitarian Press International, 19910 Page 195,</ref>\n\nIt was not until 1637, however, that his resistance to the payment of ship money gained him wide fame. Seven out of the twelve judges sided against him, but the connection between the rights of property and the parliamentary system became firmly established in the popular mind. The tax had been justified, says Clarendon, who expresses his admiration at Hampden's \"rare temper and modesty\" at this crisis, \"upon such grounds and reasons as every standerby was able to swear was not law\" (''Hist''. i. 150,  vii. 82).\n\n===Short Parliament===\nIn the Short Parliament that started on 13 April 1640, Hampden stood forth amongst the leaders. He guided the House in the debate on 4 May in its opposition to the grant of twelve subsidies in return for the surrender of ship money. Parliament was dissolved the next day, and on 6 May an unsuccessful search was made among the papers of Hampden and of other chiefs of the party to discover incriminating correspondence with the [[Scotland|Scots]]. During the eventful months which followed, when [[Thomas Wentworth, Earl of Strafford|Strafford]] was striving in vain to force England, in spite of its visible reluctance, to support the king in his [[Bishops' Wars|Scottish war]], rumour has much to tell of Hampden's activity in rousing opposition. It is likely enough that the rumour is in the main true, but we are not possessed of any satisfactory evidence on the subject.\n\n===Long Parliament===\nIn the [[Long Parliament]], though Hampden was by no means a frequent speaker, it is possible to trace his course with sufficient distinctness. His power consisted in his personal influence, and as a debater rather than as an orator.  \"He was not a man of many words,\" says Clarendon, \"and rarely began the discourse or made the first entrance upon any business that was assumed, but a very weighty speaker, and after he had heard a full debate and observed how the House was likely to be inclined, took up the argument and shortly and clearly and craftily so stated it that he commonly conducted it to the conclusion he desired; and if he found he could not do that, he never was without the dexterity to divert the debate to another time, and to prevent the determining anything in the negative which might prove inconvenient in the future\" (''Hist''. iii. 31). Unwearied in attendance upon committees, he was in all things ready to second Pym, whom he plainly regarded as his leader.\n\nHampden was one of the eight managers of Strafford's prosecution. Like Pym, he was in favour of the more legal and regular procedure by [[impeachment]] rather than by [[attainder]], which at the later stage was supported by the majority of the Commons; and through his influence a compromise was effected by which, while an attainder was subsequently adopted, Strafford's counsel were heard as in the case of an impeachment, and thus a serious breach between the two Houses, which threatened to cause the breakdown of the whole proceedings, was averted.\n\n===Debate on episcopacy===\n[[File:John Hampden Statue.jpg|left|thumb|Statue of John Hampden in Market Square, [[Aylesbury]], Buckinghamshire]]\n\nThere was another point on which there was no agreement. A large minority wished to retain [[episcopacy]], and to keep the [[Book of Common Prayer]] unaltered, whilst the majority were at least willing to consider the question of abolishing the one and modifying the other. On this subject the parties which ultimately divided the House and the country itself were fully formed as early as 8 February 1641. It is enough to say that Hampden fully shared in the counsels of the opponents of episcopacy. It is not that he was a theoretical [[Presbyterianism|Presbyterian]], but the [[bishop]]s had been in his days so fully engaged in the imposition of ceremonies regarded by the [[Puritans]] as verging on [[Papacy]] that it was difficult, if not impossible, to dissociate them from the cause in which they were embarked.  Closely connected with Hampden's distrust of the bishops was his distrust of monarchy as it then existed. The dispute about the church therefore soon attained the form of an attack upon [[monarchy]], and, when the majority of the [[House of Lords]] arrayed itself on the side of episcopacy and the Prayer Book, of an attack upon the House of Lords as well.\n\nNo serious importance therefore can be attached to the offers of advancement made from time to time to Hampden and his friends. Charles would gladly have given them office if they had been ready to desert their principles. Every day Hampden's conviction grew stronger that Charles would never surrender a position which he had taken up. In August 1641 Hampden was one of the four commissioners who attended Charles in Scotland, and the king's conduct there, connected with such events as the \"Incident\", must have proved to a man far less sagacious than Hampden that the time for compromise had gone by. He was therefore a warm supporter of the [[Grand Remonstrance]], and was marked out as one of the five impeached members, known thenceforth in history as the [[Five Members]] (the others being [[John Pym]], [[Arthur Haselrig]], [[Denzil Holles, 1st Baron Holles|Denzil Holles]] and [[William Strode]]) whose attempted arrest brought at last the opposing parties into open collision. In the angry scene which arose on the proposal to print the Grand Remonstrance, it was Hampden's personal intervention which prevented an actual conflict, and it was after the impeachment had been attempted that Hampden laid down the two conditions under which resistance to the king became the duty of a good subject.  Those conditions were:\n*an attack upon religion and\n*an attack upon the fundamental laws.\n\nThere can be no doubt that Hampden fully believed that both those conditions were fulfilled at the opening of 1642.\n\n==English Civil War==\n\nWhen the [[English Civil War]] began, Hampden was appointed a member of the [[ Committee of Safety (England) #1642\u20131644 | Committee of Safety]], levied a [[regiment]] of Buckinghamshire men for the parliamentary cause, and in his capacity of deputy-lieutenant carried out the parliamentary [[Militia Ordinance]] in the county. In the earlier operations of the war he bore himself gallantly and well. He took no actual part in the [[Battle of Edgehill]] (23 October 1642). His troops in the rear,  however, arrested [[Prince Rupert of the Rhine]]'s charge at [[Kineton]], and he urged Essex to renew the attack here, and also after the disaster at [[Battle of Brentford (1642)|Brentford]]. In the spring of 1643, Hampden's regiment took part in the [[siege of Reading]], which surrendered on 27 April. Although Essex intended to advance on the King's headquarters at Oxford, he remained at Reading because of widespread sickness in the army, a shortage of cavalry and to await a paymaster with funds to pay his troops. In early June 1643 he moved his army to Thame making his headquarters there on 10 June.\n\nBut it is not on his skill as a regimental officer that Hampden's fame rests. In war as in peace his distinction lay in his power of disentangling the essential part from the non-essential. In the previous constitutional struggle he had seen that the one thing necessary was to establish the supremacy of the [[British House of Commons|House of Commons]].  In the military struggle which followed he saw, as Cromwell saw afterwards, that the one thing necessary was to beat the enemy.  He protested at once against Essex's hesitations and compromises.  In the formation of the confederacy of the six associated counties, which was to supply a basis for Cromwell's operations, he took an active part.  His influence was felt alike in parliament and in the field but he was not in supreme command, and he had none of that impatience which often leads able men to fail in the execution of orders of which they disapprove.\n\n===Death===\n[[File:Hampden's monument, Chalgrove.jpg|thumb|Hampden's Monument, [[Chalgrove]]. A monument to John Hampden, who was mortally wounded 550 yards north of here in 1643 whilst fighting in the English Civil War on [[Battle of Chalgrove Field|Chalgrove Field]]]]\n\nOn the night of 17 June 1643, [[Prince Rupert]] sortied on a raid out of Oxford to capture the Parliamentarian army's paymaster, but while that failed, did succeed the next morning in overwhelming two of Essex's small garrison outposts at [[Postcombe]] and [[Chinnor]]. Hampden rode as a volunteer with 1,100 cavalry and dragoons commanded by Sir [[Philip Stapleton]] in pursuit of Rupert, with the intention of delaying him long enough for a larger force from Essex's main army to cut off his retreat. Rupert halted his own cavalry at [[Chalgrove]] to ambush the pursuit and allow 800 less mobile troops to escape via the ford of the [[River Thame]] at [[Chiselhampton]]. During the ensuing [[Battle of Chalgrove Field]], Hampden was mortally wounded (some sources claim in the shoulder by two carbine balls, others by fragments from his own pistol exploding<ref>Britannica 1911 (article \"HAMPDEN, JOHN\") \"two carbine balls\".

Sir Robert assured him that he bought them in Paris from an eminent maker and proved them himself. It appeared on examining the other pistol that it was loaded to the muzzle with several supernumerary charges, owning to the carelessness of a servant. He was ordered to see that the pistols were loaded every morning which he did but without drawing the former charge.\" An exhumation of Hampden's body in 1828 showed that there was no damage to the shoulder but his 'right hand was shattered by the bursting of his pistol, and death probably ensued from [[tetanus|lockjaw]] arising out of extensive injury to the nervous system'.<ref>Frederick George Lee, The History, description and antiquities of the Prebendal Church of the Blessed Virgin Mary of Thame in the county and diocese of Oxford.

During the preceding winter, Hampden had associated himself with John Pym's \"Middle Group\" in Parliament, which opposed any peace moves to the King except on favorable terms. At the same time he had worked to moderate the militancy of the parliamentary \"War Party\". Although Hampden was privately critical of Essex for not aggressively attacking after avoiding defeat at Edgehill and the standoff at [[Battle of Turnham Green|Turnham Green]], he remained publicly loyal and helped Essex resist the criticisms of the War Party. His death took with it a key link between the factions. Hearing of his death, the Member of Parliament [[Anthony Nicholl]] pronounced: \"Never Kingdom received a greater loss in one subject, never a man a truer and faithful friend.\"<ref>\"Selected Readings in English History\". p. 265.

It is spread by transfer from the oral/nasal secretions of an infected individual to the [[oral cavity]] of an uninfected individual. Once in the oral cavity, the virus invades, reproduces in, establishes its lytic phase in, and [[lysis]] (i.e. bursts open) [[epithelial]] cells that line the oral [[mucosa]] of the newly infected individual. The freed virus then invades [[na\u00efve B cell]]s located in [[submucosa]]l lymphoid tissue e.g. [[tonsils]] or [[adenoids]]. Here, it establishes either a lytic phase that allows it to infect other lymphoid cells or expresses genes that suppress the lytic cycle and impose one of four latency phases. Initially, the virus establishes '''latency III''' by expressing [[Cell nucleus|nuclear]] proteins encoded by its [[Epstein\u2013Barr virus#Latency|''EBNA-1, -2, -3A, -3B, -3C, LP, LMP-1, -2A,'' and ''-2B'']] and [[Epstein-Barr virus#Protein/genes|BART]] genes; [[cell membrane|cell surface membrane]] proteins encoded by its [[Epstein\u2013Barr virus#Latent antigens|''LMP-1, -2A,'' and ''3A'']] genes; and [[microRNA]]s encoded by its [[Epstein\u2013Barr virus-encoded small RNAs#EBER1|''EBER-1'']] and [[Epstein\u2013Barr virus-encoded small RNAs#EBER1|''EBER-2'']] genes. The products of these genes immortalize, promote the growth and survival, and regulate the maturation of the infected B cell. However, products of some latency III genes (particularly the viral cell surface proteins) make the infected cell susceptible to attack by the host's immune system. The virus avoids this by limiting expression of its latency genes to ''EBNA-1, LMP-1, -2A, -2B'', some BARTs, and the two EBERs. This '''Latency II''' pattern of gene expression continues the infected cells' immortalization and proliferation, helps the cells escape the [[immune system#Tumor immunology|immune surveillance]], and forces them to [[Cellular differentiation|differentiate]] (i.e. mature) into [[memory B cell]]s. EBV may establish and maintain a '''Latency I''' state in its infected memory B cells by expressing only ''EBNA1'' and the two EBER genes. The products of the latter genes keep the virus in a mostly dormant state. Finally, EBV may establish and maintain a '''Latency 0''' phase by expressing only EBER genes. In latency 0, EBV is in memory B cells as fully dormant, non-reproductive viruses but in this, as in all of the other latency phases, it can revert to its lytic phase.<ref name=\"pmid30125149\"/> The following table gives more information on the actions of the EBV latency genes.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

It is an EBV+ disorder in which most cases develop in children, follow a waxing and waning course, and resolve in early adulthood. However, the disorder can occur in adults. Furthermore, the disease in children or adults may progress to cause severe, extensive, and disfiguring skin lesions unrelated to sunlight exposure, facial edema, and systemic manifestations such as fever, weight loss, and enlargements of lymph nodes, liver, and/or spleen.

''MYC'' is a [[Oncogene#Protoo-oncogene|proto-oncogene]] (i.e. a cancer-causing gene if appropriately mutated or overexpressed) located on the long (\"q\") arm of human chromosome 8 at position 24 (i.e. at 8q24). In ~90% of BL cases, ''MYC'' is [[Chromosomal translocation|translocated]] to the ''[[IGH@|IGH]]'' (i.e. [[Immunoglobulin heavy chain]]) gene locus at position 14q32, the ''[[IGK@|IGK]]'' (i.e. [[Immunoglobulin light chain|immunoglobulin kappa light chain]]) gene at position 2p12 (\"p\" stands for short chromosome arm), or the ''[[IGL@|IGL]]'' (i.e. [[Immunoglobulin light chain|immunoglobulin lambda light chain]]) gene at position 22q11. These translocations  bring ''MYC'' under the [[gene#Transcription|transcriptional]] control of these antibody-forming loci and thereby cause the ''MYC'' product, [[Myc]] to be overexpressed and continuously driving the infected cell to proliferate. Mutations in other genes of the infected cell may promote its malignancy, e.g. ~30% of BL cases harbor B cell ''P53'' gene mutations which may promote cell survival.<ref name=\"pmid29518976\"/> These althernate, potentially EBV-independent routes to malignancy and the fact that some BL cases do not involve EBV allow that many cases of EBV+ BL are not caused and/or promoted by EBV: the ubiquitous virus is the likely cause of almost all cases of eBL but be an innocent [[passenger virus]] in many cases of sBL and iBL.<ref name=\"pmid29885408\"/>\n\nPatients with any of the three forms of BL (with or without an association with EBV) are treated with  multiple drug [[chemotherapy]] regimens. While past studies found much better results in children than adults using this approach, recent studies report that more aggressive chemotherapy regimens that include the [[intrathecal administration]] of drugs give better results. The COCOX-M-IVAC regimen (systemic [[cyclophosphamide]], [[vincristine]], [[doxorubicin]], and high-dose [[methotrexate]] alternating with [[ifosfamide]], [[etoposide]], and [[cytarabine]] plus intrathecal methotrexate and cytarabine) give event-free 2 year response rates of >90% in both children and adults. Addition of [[rituximab]], a [[monoclonal antibody]] against the CD20 antigen expressed on B cells, may be added to this or other multiple drug regimens. Autologous [[Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation|stem cell bone marrow transplantation]] has not improved the results of these regiments. Treatment of HIV-associated iBL is similar to, and has success rates comparable, to non-HIV BL, particularly when coupled with treatment directed at HIV although adults >40 years old have had poorer responses to these regiments.

Thus, the relationship of EBV to the development and progression of PTCL, NOS is unclear.<ref name=\"pmid29885408\"/>\n\nThere are no controlled studies on the treatment of this disease. Recommended treatments for advanced stage PTCL, NOS (regardless of EBV status) include intensive chemotherapy regimens, e.g. [[CHOP]], as [[Therapy#Lines of therapy|induction therapy]] possibly followed by [[autologous]] [[hematopoietic stem cell transplantation]]. These regimens have shown only limited results with 5 year overall survival rates <50% for chemotherapy alone. These survival rates may be improved in patients able to withstand follow-up bone marrow transplantation. Newer drug approaches using [[Pralatrexate]], [[Romidepsin]], [[Brentuximab vedotin]], [[Belinostat]], [[Bendamustine]], [[lenalidomide]], and [[alisertib]] have shown activity against CTCL, NOS and are being further studied in randomized trials for use in treating refractory and relapsed as well as initial disease.<ref name=\"pmid28115372\"/>\n\n==== Angioimmunoblastic T cell lymphoma ====\n{{main|angioimmunoblastic T-cell lymphoma}}\nAngioimmunoblastic T cell lymphoma (ATIL) is a systemic malignancy of mature [[follicular B helper T cells]] (T<sub>FH</sub> cells).<ref name=\"pmid29885408\"/> ATIL is often manifested soon after individuals ingest antibiotics or have an infection or allergic reaction. The disease presents with generalized swelling of lymph nodes, enlarged liver and spleen, skin lesions (rash, or, less commonly, nodules, plaques, [[purpura]], and [[urticarial]]),  bone marrow involvement, and [[B symptoms]] of fever, weight loss, and [[night sweats]]. Individuals may also present with [[arthralgias]], [[arthritis]], [[pleural effusion]]s, [[ascites]], lung lesions, and neurological and gastrointestinal disturbances. Laboratory tests commonly reveal the presence of [[hemolytic anemia#Extrinsic causes|immune-mediated hemolytic anemia]]; elevated blood levels of [[eosinophils]], [[gamma globulins]], and [[lactic dehydrogenase]]; high [[erythrocyte sedimentation rate]]s; and positive blood tests for [[autoantibodies]] such as [[rheumatoid factor]], [[anti-nuclear antibody]], and [[anti-smooth muscle antibody]]. Several of these clinical and laboratory features suggest that the afflicted individuals have an underlining abnormality in their [[immune system]]. Involved tissues exhibit vascular proliferation, small lymphoid cells clustered around [[venule]]s in a background containing T<sub>FH</sub> cells, activated lymphocytes, [[follicular dendritic cells]], [[epithelioid cell]]s, [[plasma cell]]s, and [[eosinophil]]s. Only the T<sub>FH</sub> cells are malignant. The latter cells represent 5\u201330% of all cells in the disease's lesions, express T<sub>FH</sub> cell marker proteins (e.g. [[CD3 (immunology)|CD3]], [[CD4]], [[CD10]], [[programmed cell death protein 1]] (PD-1), and also express the B lymphocyte [[chemoattractant]], [[CXCL13|chemokine (C-X-C motif) ligand 13]] (i.e. CXCL13).<ref name=\"pmid24468316\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Mosalpuria K, Bociek RG, Vose JM | title = Angioimmunoblastic T-cell lymphoma management | journal = Seminars in Hematology | volume = 51 | issue = 1 | pages = 52\u20138 | date = January 2014 | pmid = 24468316 | doi = 10.1053/j.seminhematol.2013.11.008 | url = }}</ref> Virtually all cases exhibit a scattering of EBV+ B cells with the virus possibly being in a restricted latency II phase.

It is due to the immunosuppressive drug regimens that accompany these transplantations. EBV-positivity occurs in 60\u201380% of these cases and, unlike EBV-negative cases, EBV+ cases develop more often within the first year after transplantation. The 2026 WHO classification divides these disorders into:<ref name=\"pmid28506687\"/>\n\n'''1)''' Non-destructive PTLD: this disorder is characterized by [[hyperplasia]] of [[plasma cell]]s, florid hyperplasia of [[lymph node]] follicles, and infectious mononucleosis. All three of these are non-malignant disorders that involve lesions admixed with non-destructive proliferations of plasma which are usually EBV-negative, EBV-negative B cells, and rare EBV-positive T cells.\n\n'''2)''' Monomorphic PTLD: this disorder is a B- or T cell lymphoms. It includes only aggressive lymphomas while excluding all indolent forms of LPD except for the inclusion of EBV-positive mucocutaneous ulcer The EBV+ positivity of cells involved in these PTLD are similar to those occurring in immune-competent individuals. In EBV-positive mucocutaneous ulcer, lesions commonly include EBV-positive plasma cells.\n\n'''3)''' Classic Hodgkin lymphoma: This HD malignancy is characterized by have EBV+ cells its lesions. These lesions are otherwise similar to those occurring in immune competent individuals.\n\nThe virus in the three PTLD are in latency phase III and express most if not all of their latency genes including, in particular, LMP1 and LMP2A.

FDCS is a rare malignancy of [[follicular dendritic cell]]s (FD cells). These [[myofibroblast]]-like cells are derived from the stroma (i.e. [[connective tissue]]) of [[Lymph node stromal cell|lymph nodes]] and other [[Lymphatic system#Lymphoid tissue|lympatic tissue]] and therefore are not lymphocytes. FD cells express several markers expressed by lymphocytes; occupy the [[germinal center]]s of lymphoid tissues; and attract, stimulate the differentiation and proliferation of, and [[antigen-presenting cell|present foreign antigens]] to B-cells.<ref name=\"pmid25310210\"/> The FD cells in FDCS may derive from [[follicular lymphoma]] cells by the process of [[transdifferentiation]].<ref name=\"pmid25310210\"/> FDCS affects primarily young to middle-aged adults of both sexes. Afflicted individuals commonly present with painless, slowly progressive swelling of cervical lymph nodes. About 33% of cases exhibit (with or without cervical lymph node swelling) tumors of skin, [[mediastinum]], tonsils, gastrointestinal tract, and/or soft tissues.

It is spread by transfer from the oral/nasal secretions of an infected individual to the [[oral cavity]] of an uninfected individual. Once in the oral cavity, the virus invades, reproduces in, establishes its lytic phas ine, and [[lysis]] (i.e. bursts open) [[epithelial]] cells that line the oral [[mucosa]] of the newly infected individual. The freed virus then invades [[na\u00efve B cell]]s located in [[submucosa]]l lymphoid tissue e.g. [[tonsils]] or [[adenoids]]. Here, it establishes either a lytic phase that allows it to infect other lymphoid cells or expresses genes that suppress the lytic cycle and impose one of four latency phases. Initially, the virus establishes '''latency III''' by expressing [[Cell nucleus|nuclear]] proteins encoded by its [[Epstein\u2013Barr virus#Latency|''EBNA-1, -2, -3A, -3B, -3C, LP, LMP-1, -2A,'' and ''-2B'']] and [[Epstein-Barr virus#Protein/genes|BART]] genes; [[cell membrane|cell surface membrane]] proteins encoded by its [[Epstein\u2013Barr virus#Latent antigens|''LMP-1, -2A,'' and ''3A'']] genes; and [[microRNA]]s encoded by its [[Epstein\u2013Barr virus-encoded small RNAs#EBER1|''EBER-1'']] and [[Epstein\u2013Barr virus-encoded small RNAs#EBER1|''EBER-2'']] genes. The products of these genes immortalize, promote the growth and survival, and regulate the maturation of the infected B cell. However, products of some latency III genes (particularly the viral cell surface proteins) make the infected cell susceptible to attack by the host's immune system. The virus avoids this by limiting expression of its latency genes to ''EBNA-1, LMP-1, -2A, -2B'', some BARTs, and the two EBERs. This '''Latency II''' pattern of gene expression continues the infected cells' immortalization and proliferation, helps the cells escape the [[immune system#Tumor immunology|immune surveillance]], and forces them to [[Cellular differentiation|differentiate]] (i.e. mature) into [[memory B cell]]s. EBV may establish and maintain a '''Latency I''' state in its infected memory B cells by expressing only ''EBNA1'' and the two EBER genes. The products of the latter genes keep the virus in a mostly dormant state. Finally, EBV may establish and maintain a '''Latency 0''' phase by expressing only EBER genes.

The lesions occur primarily on the sun-exposed skin of the face and back of the hand. It is an EBV+ disorder in which most cases develop in children, follow a waxing and waning course, and resolve in early adulthood. However, the disorder can occur in adults. Furthermore, the disease in children or adults may progress to cause severe, extensive, and disfiguring skin lesions unrelated to sunlight exposure, facial edema, and systemic manifestations such as fever, weight loss, and enlargements of lymph nodes, liver, and/or spleen. These cases may progress to an EBV+ LPD such as [[T cell lymphoma]], [[T cell leukemia]], [[B cell lymphoma]], or [[B cell leukemia]].<ref name=\"pmid28477890\"/> The milder and more aggressive forms of hydroa vacciniforme were initially termed classic hydroa vacciniforme and hydroa vacciniforme-like lymphoma, respectively, but extensive overlap between the two disease types lead the 2016 [[World Health Organization]] to reclassify them into a single disorder termed Hydroa vacciniforme-like lymphoproliferative disease and to be a subcategory of CAEBV.

It is thought that the reduce efficacy of [[Immune system#Tumor immunology|immune surveillance]] associated with these predisposing conditions or treatments maintain EBV in a dormant state systemically but not where EBV+ B cells are prevalent, i.e. in afflicted mucous membranes and skin. Consequently, the EBV+ cells at these sites proliferate and destroy tissue to create ulcerating lesions.<ref name=\"pmid28477890\" />\n\nPersons developing these ulcers are usually elderly. Their ulcers are typically isolated, occur in the oral [[mucosa]] and less commonly in skin or [[gastrointestinal tract]] mucosa. Besides pain at the ulcer site and local tissue destruction (which may be severe), individuals with EBV+ mucocutaneous ulcer are symptomless and lack [[lymphadenopathy]] (i.e. enlarged and painful lymph nodes), involvement in other tissues, or B symptoms. However, ulcers in the gastrointestinal tract may present with a variety of abdominal symptoms including acute emergency perforations. Unlike most other forms of EBV+LPD, EBV-associated mucocutantious ulcers are generally not associated with detectable blood levels of EBV.<ref name=\"pmid28477890\"/> Microscopically, the ulcers consist of lymphocytes, including EBV+ B cells, sometimes a scattering of other EBV+ lymphoid cell types, and [[histiocyte]]s, [[plasma cells]], [[eosinophils]], and scattered large [[immunoblast]]s which may closely resemble but are not the [[Reed\u2013Sternberg cell]]s seen in Hodgkin lymphoma.<ref name=\"pmid29518976\"/> These Reed-Sternberg\u2013like cells are EBV+ B cells that express the [[tumor marker]] cell surface membrane protein, [[CD30]], the B cell surface membrane marker, [[CD20]],<ref name=\"pmid28477890\"/> and the proteins typical of the EBV replication cycle latency II or III phase.<ref name=\"pmid29885408\"/>\n\nIn elderly individuals with no other cause for immunosuppression, EBV+ mucocutaneous disease may exhibit a relapsing and remitting course with their ulcers worsening but then regressing spontaneously.<ref name=\"pmid28477890\"/> Persistent and/or severely symptomatic cases have had excellent responses to [[rituximab]], a commercial [[monoclonal antibody]] directed against the CD20 protein present on B cells.<ref name=\"pmid29518976\"/> Individuals developing these ulcers as a consequence of immunosuppressive therapy for other diseases generally have a remission after the dosages of the drugs used in their immunosuppressive treatment regimens are reduced. Most of these patients do not experience a relapse.<ref name=\"pmid28477890\"/>\n\n== EBV+ B cell lymphoproliferative diseases ==\nAfter its initial entry into B cells, the Epstein\u2013Barr virus infects other B cells and in doing so may or may not cause a symptomatic disease viz., infectious mononucleosis. In either case, the virus soon switches to its dormant, [[Virus latency|viral latency 0]] phase within [[memory B cell]]s and the infected individual becomes an asymptomatic, lifelong EBV carrier.

The lymphocytes are primarily B cells (e.g., express [[CD20]] and [[CD10]] markers) with rare T cells evident only in the background.<ref name=\"pmid22333947\"/> The B cells are derived mostly from germinal center B cells, contain EBV in latency I phase, and express high levels of EBNA1 and EBER viral products.

''MYC'' is a [[Oncogene#Protoo-oncogene|proto-oncogene]] (i.e. a cancer-causing gene if appropriately mutated or overexpressed) located on the long (\"q\") arm of human chromosome 8 at position 24 (i.e. at 8q24). In ~90% of BL cases, ''MYC'' is [[Chromosomal translocation|translocated]] to the ''[[IGH@|IGH]]'' (i.e. [[Immunoglobulin heavy chain]]) gene locus at position 14q32, the ''[[IGK@|IGK]]'' (i.e. [[Immunoglobulin light chain|immunoglobulin kappa light chain]]) gene at position 2p12 (\"p\" stands for short chromosome arm), or the ''[[IGL@|IGL]]'' (i.e. [[Immunoglobulin light chain|immunoglobulin lambda light chain]]) gene at position 22q11. These translocations  bring ''MYC'' under the [[gene#Transcription|transcriptional]] control of these antibody-forming loci and thereby cause the ''MYC'' product, [[Myc]] to be overexpressed and continuously driving the infected cell to proliferate. Mutations in other genes of the infected cell may promote its malignancy, e.g. ~30% of BL cases harbor B cell ''P53'' gene mutations which may promote cell survival.<ref name=\"pmid29518976\"/> These althernate, potentially EBV-independent routes to malignancy and the fact that some BL cases do not involve EBV allow that many cases of EBV+ BL are not caused and/or promoted by EBV: the ubiquitous virus is the likely cause of almost all cases of eBL but be an innocent [[passenger virus]] in many cases of sBL and iBL.<ref name=\"pmid29885408\"/>\n\nPatients with any of the three forms of BL (with or without an association with EBV) are treated with  multiple drug [[chemotherapy]] regimens. While past studies found much better results in children than adults using this approach, recent studies report that more aggressive chemotherapy regimens that include the [[intrathecal administration]] of drugs give better results. The COCOX-M-IVAC regimen (systemic [[cyclophosphamide]], [[vincristine]], [[doxorubicin]], and high-dose [[methotrexate]] alternating with [[ifosfamide]], [[etoposide]], and [[cytarabine]] plus intrathecal methotrexate and cytarabine) give event-free 2 year response rates of >90% in both children and adults. Addition of [[rituximab]], a [[monoclonal antibody]] against the CD20 antigen expressed on B cells, may be added to this or other multiple drug regimens. Autologous [[Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation|stem cell bone marrow transplantation]] has not improved the results of these regiments. Treatment of HIV-associated iBL is similar to, and has success rates comparable, to non-HIV BL, particularly when coupled with treatment directed at HIV although adults >40 years old have had poorer responses to these regiments.

This gene product protein, LMP1, mimics activated human [[TNF receptor superfamily|TNF receptors]] (e.g. [[CD40]], [[CD40]], and [[RANK]]) in continuously stimulating the [[NF-\u03baB]], [[PI3K]] and [[JAK-STAT signaling pathway]]s which promote cell proliferation, survival, and production of [[cytokines]] that may suppress the EBV's lytic cycle to maintain the HRS cells viability.<ref name=\"pmid28893938\"/> HRS cells also express the virus's LMP2A gene protein product which mimics the human [[BCR (gene)|BCR gene]] product) in promoting the survival of its parent cells.<ref name=\"pmid29885408\"/> And, EBV, by undefined mechanisms, causes ''crippling'' mutations in the HRS cell's [[V(D)J recombination|rearranged immunoglobulin G genes]] to prevent them from expressing immunoglobulins and inducing them to secrete cytokines which recruit the other cited cell types into the EBV+HL's pathological infiltrates. This helps create a local environment conducive for HRS cells to evade the immune system and proliferate.<ref name=\"pmid28893938\"/>\n\nEBV+ HL is more prevalent in young children and young adults but can occur in those over 80 years old, perhaps because of [[Immunosenescence|old age-related]] deterioration in immune system function, infectious diseases, or malnutrition.<ref name=\"pmid29885408\"/> The incidence of EBV+ HD's in individuals with [[HIV/AIDS]] is also high, ~10-fold greater than the general population, but the causes for this is unclear.<ref name=\"pmid28893938\"/> The presentation of EBV+ HL is similar to that of EBV-HL, e.g. fever, night sweats, weight loss in the setting of swollen lymph nodes, and/or evidence of tumor invasion of other tissues.

EBV+ DLBCL is distinguished from DLBCL (often termed diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, not otherwise specified, i.e. DLBCL, NOS) in that virtually all the large B cells in the tissue infiltrates of the EBV+ disease type express EBV genes characteristic of the virus's latency III (common in the elderly) or II (common in younger patients) phase.<ref name=\"pmid25294567\"/> These large B cells in EBV+ DLBCL are [[centroblast]]ic (i.e. activated) B-cells<ref name=\"pmid30125149\"/> that express EBERs,<ref name=\"pmid29518976\"/> LMP1, EBNA1, EBNA2, and other viral proteins;<ref name=\"pmid29885408\"/> in >50% of cases, they also express classic B cell antigenic proteins such as [[CD20]], [[BCL6]], and [[CD15]].

Signs and symptoms of DLBCL-CI reflect the destructive effects of the malignancy in the afflicted areas. The infiltrative lesions consist of diffuse large EBV+ B cells in latency III amidst a variety of benign, EBV-negative chronic inflammatory [[white blood cells]]. The EBV+ large B cells in these lesions often have reduced expression of the CD20 antigen and contain genetic abnormalities such as mutations in ''[[P53]]'', overexpression of ''[[Myc]]'', and deletion of ''[[TNFAIP3]]''.

Afflicted individuals commonly present with painless, slowly progressive swelling of cervical lymph nodes. About 33% of cases exhibit (with or without cervical lymph node swelling) tumors of skin, [[mediastinum]], tonsils, gastrointestinal tract, and/or soft tissues.

His first printed work was a translation of [[Horace]]'s epistle to [[Maecenas]], published when he was still 15. From that time on, his poetic language was distinguished from that of Pushkin and other contemporaries by its liberal use of majestic, solemn Slavonic archaisms.\n\nHis family tutor was [[Semyon Raich]], a minor poet and translator under whose guidance Tyutchev undertook his first poetic steps. From 1819 to 1821 Tyutchev studied at the Philological Faculty of [[Moscow University]]. After graduating he joined the Foreign Office and in 1822 accompanied his relative, Count [[Ostermann-Tolstoy]], to [[Munich]] to take up a post as trainee diplomat at the Russian legation. He was to remain abroad for 22 years.\n\nIn Munich he fell in love with [[Amalie Adlerberg|Amalie von Lerchenfeld]], the illegitimate half-sister of a young Bavarian diplomat, Count Maximilian Joseph von Lerchenfeld. Tyutchev's poem ''Tears'' or ''Slyozy'' (''Liubliu, druz'ya, laskat' ochami...'') coincides with one of their meetings, and is most likely dedicated to Amalie (or Am\u00e9lie, as she was usually known). Among other poems inspired by her are ''K. N.'', and ''Ia pomniu vremia zolotoe\u2026'' Published extracts from the letters and diaries of Maximilian von Lerchenfeld illuminate the first years of Tyutchev as a diplomat in Munich (1822\u20131826), giving details of his [[frustration|frustrated]] love affair for Am\u00e9lie, nearly involving a duel (probably with his colleague, Baron [[Alexander von Kr\u00fcdener]]), in January 1825. Am\u00e9lie was coerced by her relatives into marrying the much older Kr\u00fcdener, but she and Tyutchev continued to be friends and frequented the same diplomatic society in Munich. A late poem of 1870 with the title ''K.B.'' (''Ia vstretil vas - i vsio biloe''), long accepted on dubious evidence as addressed to Am\u00e9lie, is now thought much more likely to refer to Tyutchev's sister-in-law Clotilde (or Klothilde) von Bothmer.<ref>Nikolayev, A.A., 'Zagaka \"K.B.\"', ''Neva'', 1988, No. 2, pp. 190-196.</ref> Tyutchev's last meeting with Am\u00e9lie took place on March 31, 1873 (OS) when she visited him on his deathbed. The next day, Tyutchev wrote to his daughter Daria: \n<blockquote>\nYesterday I felt a moment of burning emotion due to my meeting with... my dear Amalie Kr\u00fcdener who wished to see me for the last time in this world and came to take her leave of me. In her person my past and the best years of my life came to give me a farewell kiss.<ref>F.I. Tyutchev, ''Polnoe sobranie sochineniy i pis'ma'', 6 vols., Moscow, 2002-2005. VI, p. 416.</ref>\n</blockquote>\n\nIn Munich, he came under the influence of the German Romantic movement, and this is reflected in his poetry. Among the figures, he knew personally were the poet [[Heinrich Heine]] and the philosopher [[Friedrich Schelling]]. In 1826, he married the [[Bavaria]]n widow of a Russian diplomat [[Eleonore Peterson]], n\u00e9e Countess von Bothmer. She became the mother of his daughter [[Anna Tiuttjev]].  Following her death in 1838, Tyutchev married another aristocratic young German widow, Baroness [[Ernestine von D\u00f6rnberg]], n\u00e9e von Pfeffel, who had become his mistress and had a child by him while Eleonore was still alive. Neither of his wives understood Russian to begin with (Ernestine made efforts to learn the language only much later). That is hardly surprising since Tyutchev spoke French better than Russian and nearly all his private correspondence was in the former language. \n[[Image:Owstug.JPG|thumb|left|The manor of Tyutchev's father in the [[Bryansk Oblast|Bryansk region]]]]\n\nIn 1836, a young former colleague at the Munich legation, Prince Ivan Gagarin, obtained Tyutchev's permission to publish his selected poems in ''[[Sovremennik]]'', a literary journal edited by Pushkin. Although appreciated by the great Russian poet, the superb lyrics failed to spark off any public interest. The death of Eleonore in 1838 hit Tyutchev hard and appears to have silenced him as a poet for some considerable time, and for ten years afterwards, he wrote hardly any lyric verse. Instead, he turned his attention to publishing political articles in Western periodicals such as the ''[[Revue des Deux Mondes]]'' outlining his strongly held views on Russia's role in the world (see below).\n\nIn 1837, Tyutchev was transferred from Munich to the Russian legation in [[Turin]]. He found his new place of residence uncongenial to his disposition and after marrying Ernestine, he resigned from his position there to settle in Munich. It was later discovered that Tyutchev had actually abandoned his post as charg\u00e9 d'affaires in Turin without official permission to marry in Switzerland, and he was dismissed from the Foreign Service as a result. He continued to live in Germany for five more years without position before returning to Russia. Upon his eventual return to [[St Petersburg]] in 1844, the poet was much lionised in the highest society. His daughter Kitty caused a sensation, and the novelist [[Leo Tolstoy]] wooed her, \"almost prepared to marry her impassively, without love, but she received me with studied coldness\", as he remarked in a diary. Kitty would later become influential at [[Konstantin Pobedonostsev]]'s circle at the Russian court. Not long after his return to Russia, Tyutchev was reinstated in government service as a censor, rising eventually to become Chairman of the Foreign Censorship Committee and a Privy Councillor.\n\nTyutchev loved to travel, often volunteering for diplomatic courier missions as a way of combining business with pleasure. One of his lengthiest and most significant missions was to newly independent Greece in the autumn of 1833. During his years abroad there were visits home on leave, and after settling in Russia in 1844, he would sometimes spend short periods on the family estate at Ovstug. Tours undertaken in a private capacity took him to many parts of continental Europe, including Italy, France, Germany, Austria and Switzerland. He was particularly drawn to the Swiss lakes and mountains. Many of his best poems were inspired by such journeys.\n\nAs a poet, Tyutchev was little known during his lifetime. His 400 or so short poems were the only pieces he ever wrote in Russian. Tyutchev regarded his poems as ''bagatelles'', not worthy of publication. He generally did not care to write them down and, if he did, he would often lose papers they were scribbled upon. [[Nikolay Nekrasov]], when listing Russian poets in 1850, praised Tyutchev as one of the most talented among \"minor poets\". It was only in 1854 that his first volume of verse was printed, which was prepared by [[Ivan Turgenev]] and others without any help from the author.\n\nIn 1850, he began an illicit affair with [[Elena Denisyeva]], over twenty years his junior. She remained his mistress until her death from [[tuberculosis]] in 1864, and she bore him three children. The affair produced a body of lyrics rightly considered among the finest love poems in the language. Permeated with a sublime feeling of subdued despair, the so-called \"Denisyeva Cycle\" has been variously described by critics as \"a novel in verse\", \"a human document, shattering in the force of its emotion\", and \"a few songs without comparison in Russian, perhaps even in world poetry\".<ref>I.V. Petrova; K.V. Pigarev; D.S. Merezhkovsky. Quoted in John Dewey, ''Mirror of the Soul. A Life of the Poet Fyodor Tyutchev'', Shaftesbury (Brimstone Press), 2010, p. 325.</ref> One of the poems, ''Last Love'', is often cited as emblematic of the whole cycle.\n\nIn the early 1870s, the deaths of his brother, son and daughter left Tyutchev deeply depressed. (Depression was something from which he suffered at intervals throughout his life.) Following a series of strokes, he died in [[Tsarskoye Selo]] in 1873 and was interred at [[Novodevichy Cemetery (Saint Petersburg)|Novodevichy Monastery in St. Petersburg]]. Ernestine survived him by 21 years.\n\n==Political views==\n[[File:Tyutcheva.jpg|thumb|165px|Tyutchev's second wife, Baroness Ernestine [[Pfeffel family|von Pfeffel]]. Her father was a Bavarian Ambassador in Paris and London.]]\nTyutchev was a militant [[Pan-Slavism|Pan-Slavist]], who never needed a particular reason to berate the Western powers, [[Holy See|Vatican]], [[Ottoman Empire]] or [[Poland]], the latter perceived by him as a Judas in the Slavic fold. The failure of the [[Crimean War]] made him look critically at the Russian government as well.\n\nOn domestic matters, he held broadly liberal views. He warmly welcomed most of the reforms of [[Alexander II of Russia|Tsar Alexander II]], particularly the [[Emancipation Reform of 1861]]. Both in his work as a censor and in his writings, he promoted the ideal of freedom of expression, frequently incurring the wrath of his superiors as a result, even under the more relaxed regime of Alexander II.\n\nHis fairly sizeable output of verse on political subjects is largely forgotten. One exception is a short poem which has become something of a popular maxim in Russia: \n{{Quotation|\n:Who would grasp Russia with the mind?\n:For her no yardstick was created:\n:Her soul is of a special kind,\n:By faith alone appreciated.\n:::::::::::(translated by John Dewey)}}\n\n== Poetry ==\n\nTyutchev is one of the most memorized and quoted Russian poets. [[Occasional poetry|Occasional pieces]], translations and political poems constitute about a half of his overall poetical output.\n\nThe 200 or so lyric pieces which represent the core of his poetic genius, whether describing a scene of nature or passions of love, put a premium on metaphysics. Tyutchev's world is bipolar. He commonly operates with such categories as night and day, north and south, dream and reality, cosmos and chaos, still world of winter and spring teeming with life. Each of these images is imbued with specific meaning. Tyutchev's idea of night, for example, was defined by critics as \"the poetic image often covering economically and simply the vast notions of time and space as they affect man in his struggle through life\". [https://archive.is/20080227084942/http://www.cultinfo.ru/fulltext/1/001/001/241/1.htm] In the chaotic and fathomless world of \"night\", \"winter\", or \"north\" man feels himself tragically abandoned and lonely. Hence, a modernist sense of frightening anxiety permeates his poetry. Unsurprisingly, it was not until the late 19th and early 20th century that Tyutchev was rediscovered and hailed as a great poet by the [[Russian Symbolists]] such as [[Vladimir Solovyov (philosopher)|Vladimir Solovyov]], [[Andrey Bely]] and [[Alexander Blok]].\n\n== Sample of verse ==\n\n''Silentium!'' is an archetypal poem by Tyutchev. Written in 1830, it is remarkable for its rhythm crafted so as to make reading in [[silence]] easier than aloud toward [[alterity|others]]. Like so many of his poems, its images are [[anthropomorphic]] and pulsing with [[pantheism]]. As one Russian critic put it, \"the temporal epochs of human life, its past and its present fluctuate and vacillate in equal measure: the unstoppable current of time erodes the outline of the present.\" {{note|nasledstvo}} \n[[File:Fedor Tutchev.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Portrait by [[Sergei Lvovich Levitsky|Levitsky]], 1856.]]\n:Speak not, lie hidden, and conceal\n:the way you dream, the things you feel.\n:Deep in your spirit let them rise\n:akin to stars in crystal skies\n:that set before the night is blurred:\n:delight in them and speak no word.\n\n:How can a heart expression find?\n:How should another know your mind?\n:Will he discern what quickens you?\n:A thought, once uttered, is untrue.\n:Dimmed is the fountainhead when stirred:\n:drink at the source and speak no word.\n\n:Live in your inner self alone\n:within your soul a world has grown,\n:the magic of veiled thoughts that might\n:be blinded by the outer light,\n:drowned in the noise of day, unheard...\n:take in their song and speak no word. \n:::::::::::(trans. by [[Vladimir Nabokov]])\n\nIncidentally, this poem inspired an early-20th-century composer, [[Georgi Catoire]] (the setting of the poem in the song ''Silentium''), while another one of Tyutchev's poems, \"O chem ty voesh' vetr nochnoy...\", was the inspiration for [[Nikolai Medtner]]'s ''Night Wind'' piano sonata (#7) of 1911. There is a well-known setting by [[Rakhmaninov]] of Tyutchev's poem ''Spring Waters''. While the title of [[Nikolai Myaskovsky]]'s 1910 tone poem, \"Silence\", may have been borrowed from Tyutchev, the inspiration is credited to one of Edgar Allan Poe's tales. The same poem was also set to music by the 20th-century Russian composer, [[Boris Tchaikovsky]] (1925-1996), in his 1974 cantata \"Signs of the Zodiac\". The Ukrainian<ref>[[Valentyn Sylvestrov]]</ref>{{Circular reference|date=March 2019}} composer, Valentyn Sylvestrov (born 1937), has made a memorable setting of 'Last Love', recorded by Alexi Lubimov and Jana Ivanilova on the album 'Stufen'.  At the end of [[Andrey Tarkovsky]]'s film [[Stalker (1979 film)|''Stalker'']], a character recites a Tyutchev poem. In 2007, Icelandic musician [[Bj\u00f6rk]] used this same Tyutchev poem for the lyrics to \"[[The Dull Flame Of Desire]]\" from her album ''[[Volta (album)|Volta]]''.The song was later released as a single in 2008. The 2011 contemporary classical album [[Troika (album)|Troika]] includes a setting of Tyutchev's French-language poem \u201cNous avons pu tous deux\u2026\u201d by the composer [[Isabelle Aboulker]].\n\n==See also==\n*[[Afanasy Fet]]\n* [[List of 19th-century Russian Slavophiles]]\n\n==References==\n*{{note|nasledstvo}} Literaturnoe nasledstvo.

He generally did not care to write them down and, if he did, he would often lose papers they were scribbled upon. [[Nikolay Nekrasov]], when listing Russian poets in 1850, praised Tyutchev as one of the most talented among \"minor poets\". It was only in 1854 that his first volume of verse was printed, which was prepared by [[Ivan Turgenev]] and others without any help from the author.\n\nIn 1850, he began an illicit affair with [[Elena Denisyeva]], over twenty years his junior. She remained his mistress until her death from [[tuberculosis]] in 1864, and she bore him three children. The affair produced a body of lyrics rightly considered among the finest love poems in the language. Permeated with a sublime feeling of subdued despair, the so-called \"Denisyeva Cycle\" has been variously described by critics as \"a novel in verse\", \"a human document, shattering in the force of its emotion\", and \"a few songs without comparison in Russian, perhaps even in world poetry\".<ref>I.V. Petrova; K.V. Pigarev; D.S. Merezhkovsky. Quoted in John Dewey, ''Mirror of the Soul. A Life of the Poet Fyodor Tyutchev'', Shaftesbury (Brimstone Press), 2010, p. 325.</ref> One of the poems, ''Last Love'', is often cited as emblematic of the whole cycle.\n\nIn the early 1870s, the deaths of his brother, son and daughter left Tyutchev deeply depressed. (Depression was something from which he suffered at intervals throughout his life.) Following a series of strokes, he died in [[Tsarskoye Selo]] in 1873 and was interred at [[Novodevichy Cemetery (Saint Petersburg)|Novodevichy Monastery in St. Petersburg]]. Ernestine survived him by 21 years.\n\n==Political views==\n[[File:Tyutcheva.jpg|thumb|165px|Tyutchev's second wife, Baroness Ernestine [[Pfeffel family|von Pfeffel]]. Her father was a Bavarian Ambassador in Paris and London.]]\nTyutchev was a militant [[Pan-Slavism|Pan-Slavist]], who never needed a particular reason to berate the Western powers, [[Holy See|Vatican]], [[Ottoman Empire]] or [[Poland]], the latter perceived by him as a Judas in the Slavic fold. The failure of the [[Crimean War]] made him look critically at the Russian government as well.\n\nOn domestic matters, he held broadly liberal views. He warmly welcomed most of the reforms of [[Alexander II of Russia|Tsar Alexander II]], particularly the [[Emancipation Reform of 1861]]. Both in his work as a censor and in his writings, he promoted the ideal of freedom of expression, frequently incurring the wrath of his superiors as a result, even under the more relaxed regime of Alexander II.\n\nHis fairly sizeable output of verse on political subjects is largely forgotten. One exception is a short poem which has become something of a popular maxim in Russia: \n{{Quotation|\n:Who would grasp Russia with the mind?\n:For her no yardstick was created:\n:Her soul is of a special kind,\n:By faith alone appreciated.\n:::::::::::(translated by John Dewey)}}\n\n== Poetry ==\n\nTyutchev is one of the most memorized and quoted Russian poets. [[Occasional poetry|Occasional pieces]], translations and political poems constitute about a half of his overall poetical output.\n\nThe 200 or so lyric pieces which represent the core of his poetic genius, whether describing a scene of nature or passions of love, put a premium on metaphysics. Tyutchev's world is bipolar. He commonly operates with such categories as night and day, north and south, dream and reality, cosmos and chaos, still world of winter and spring teeming with life. Each of these images is imbued with specific meaning. Tyutchev's idea of night, for example, was defined by critics as \"the poetic image often covering economically and simply the vast notions of time and space as they affect man in his struggle through life\". [https://archive.is/20080227084942/http://www.cultinfo.ru/fulltext/1/001/001/241/1.htm] In the chaotic and fathomless world of \"night\", \"winter\", or \"north\" man feels himself tragically abandoned and lonely. Hence, a modernist sense of frightening anxiety permeates his poetry. Unsurprisingly, it was not until the late 19th and early 20th century that Tyutchev was rediscovered and hailed as a great poet by the [[Russian Symbolists]] such as [[Vladimir Solovyov (philosopher)|Vladimir Solovyov]], [[Andrey Bely]] and [[Alexander Blok]].\n\n== Sample of verse ==\n\n''Silentium!'' is an archetypal poem by Tyutchev. Written in 1830, it is remarkable for its rhythm crafted so as to make reading in [[silence]] easier than aloud toward [[alterity|others]]. Like so many of his poems, its images are [[anthropomorphic]] and pulsing with [[pantheism]]. As one Russian critic put it, \"the temporal epochs of human life, its past and its present fluctuate and vacillate in equal measure: the unstoppable current of time erodes the outline of the present.\" {{note|nasledstvo}} \n[[File:Fedor Tutchev.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Portrait by [[Sergei Lvovich Levitsky|Levitsky]], 1856.]]\n:Speak not, lie hidden, and conceal\n:the way you dream, the things you feel.\n:Deep in your spirit let them rise\n:akin to stars in crystal skies\n:that set before the night is blurred:\n:delight in them and speak no word.\n\n:How can a heart expression find?\n:How should another know your mind?\n:Will he discern what quickens you?\n:A thought, once uttered, is untrue.\n:Dimmed is the fountainhead when stirred:\n:drink at the source and speak no word.\n\n:Live in your inner self alone\n:within your soul a world has grown,\n:the magic of veiled thoughts that might\n:be blinded by the outer light,\n:drowned in the noise of day, unheard...\n:take in their song and speak no word. \n:::::::::::(trans. by [[Vladimir Nabokov]])\n\nIncidentally, this poem inspired an early-20th-century composer, [[Georgi Catoire]] (the setting of the poem in the song ''Silentium''), while another one of Tyutchev's poems, \"O chem ty voesh' vetr nochnoy...\", was the inspiration for [[Nikolai Medtner]]'s ''Night Wind'' piano sonata (#7) of 1911. There is a well-known setting by [[Rakhmaninov]] of Tyutchev's poem ''Spring Waters''. While the title of [[Nikolai Myaskovsky]]'s 1910 tone poem, \"Silence\", may have been borrowed from Tyutchev, the inspiration is credited to one of Edgar Allan Poe's tales. The same poem was also set to music by the 20th-century Russian composer, [[Boris Tchaikovsky]] (1925-1996), in his 1974 cantata \"Signs of the Zodiac\". The Ukrainian<ref>[[Valentyn Sylvestrov]]</ref>{{Circular reference|date=March 2019}} composer, Valentyn Sylvestrov (born 1937), has made a memorable setting of 'Last Love', recorded by Alexi Lubimov and Jana Ivanilova on the album 'Stufen'.  At the end of [[Andrey Tarkovsky]]'s film [[Stalker (1979 film)|''Stalker'']], a character recites a Tyutchev poem. In 2007, Icelandic musician [[Bj\u00f6rk]] used this same Tyutchev poem for the lyrics to \"[[The Dull Flame Of Desire]]\" from her album ''[[Volta (album)|Volta]]''.The song was later released as a single in 2008. The 2011 contemporary classical album [[Troika (album)|Troika]] includes a setting of Tyutchev's French-language poem \u201cNous avons pu tous deux\u2026\u201d by the composer [[Isabelle Aboulker]].\n\n==See also==\n*[[Afanasy Fet]]\n* [[List of 19th-century Russian Slavophiles]]\n\n==References==\n*{{note|nasledstvo}} Literaturnoe nasledstvo.

Domestically, ''Gorjenii'' have never won any major honour, but finished as runners-up in the league at the end of the [[2012\u201313 Liga I|2012\u201313 season]] and lost a [[Cupa Ligii|League Cup]] final in [[2014\u201315 Cupa Ligii|2015]]. They qualified for the very first time in a European competition in 2013, playing in the [[UEFA Europa League]] and reaching the group stage.\n\nThe colors of the team are white and blue.\n\n==History==\n[[File:Pandurii T\u00e2rgu Jiu League Performance.svg|thumb|right|290px|Chart of yearly table positions of Pandurii T\u00e2rgu Jiu in the national leagues.]]\n\n===Founding and lower divisions (1962\u20132005)===\nPandurii T\u00e2rgu Jiu was founded in August 1962, after the merger of the two big rivals from the town, ''Flac\u0103ra-Unirea T\u00e2rgu Jiu'' and ''CIL T\u00e2rgu-Jiu''. The club entered the [[Divizia D|fourth division of Romanian football]], with a strong objective, to promote immediately in the third division. And the target was reached, Pandurii gaining the promotion to [[Divizia C]] in June 1963. Their first game in this division was played on 1 September 1963, against Siderurgistul Hunedoara. Pandurii won by a big margin, 6\u20130, goals scored by Chi\u021bu (12'), Nelu B\u0103loi (35'), Melinte (53', 80') and Vasilescu (83', 85').\n\nIn the first years, Pandurii finished constantly in the first half of the standings, so the club decided to attack a promotion to [[Liga II|Divizia B]]. In the 1976\u201377 season, with a young team and with [[Titus Ozon]] as coach, the dream came true. Pandurii dominated the competition, climbed from the first stages on top of the standings and won the promotion to the second division. But this level was a much bigger hat to wear for Pandurii, who relegated the next season back to Divizia C.\n\nThe following years, the team changed frequently the division, promoting to Divizia B and relegating after a few years. They played in Divizia B between 1979 and 1983 then between 1986 and 1991. After a decade in Divizia C, in 2000 the team promoted again in the second league, and in [[2003\u201304 Divizia B|2004]] finished second, behind [[FC Sportul Studen\u021besc Bucure\u0219ti|Sportul Studen\u021besc]].\n\n===Beginning years in the top league (2005\u20132011)=== \nThe performance from the last seasons was an incentive for the management who decided to push for the first presence of Pandurii in [[Divizia A]]. With [[Emil S\u0103ndoi]] as coach, and with a young group of players like Tiberiu Lung and Sorin Vintilescu but also with some experienced players like, [[Florin Popete]], [[Robert Vancea]] and [[Romulus Buia]], the team won the promotion.\n\nIt was difficult to maintain its position in Divizia A, and Pandurii finished their [[2005\u201306 Divizia A|first season]] in the 15th place, right below the relegation line. But the [[Romanian Football Federation]] decided at the end of the season not to give [[Sportul Studen\u021besc]] their licence for the following year, and kept instead the first team under the line, Pandurii. With the bullet dodged, the management decided to enforce the team, so the relegation shouldn't be a problem.\n\n[[Alexandru P\u0103curar]], [[Ciprian Vasilache]] and [[Liviu Mihai]] were brought, and the team finished 11th in the [[2006\u201307 Liga I|2006\u201307 season]]. They kept their position at the middle of the table for the next seasons.\n\nIn [[2009\u201310 Liga I|2010]], they finished below the line but avoided the relegation after the withdrawal of [[FC Interna\u021bional Curtea de Arge\u0219|Interna\u021bional Curtea de Arge\u0219]], team that ended tenth but the owner decided to disband the club. With a lot of players from Interna\u021bional Curtea de Arge\u0219 like [[Vlad Chiriche\u0219]], [[Mihai Pintilii]], and [[Dan Nistor]], Pandurii were 13th the [[2010\u201311 Liga I|following season]].\n\n===Ascent and first European participation (2011\u20132013)===\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: left\" align=\"right\"\n|-\n|style=\"background:#0094da;color:white;border:1px solid black\"|Period\n|style=\"background:#0094da;color:white;border:1px solid black\"|Name<ref>http://www.romaniansoccer.ro/stiri/16668/evolutia-denumirilor-echipelor-de-a-lungul-anilor.htm</ref>\n|-\n|1963\u20131965\n|align=left|'''Pandurii T\u00e2rgu Jiu'''\n|-\n|1965\u20131970\n|align=left|''Victoria T\u00e2rgu Jiu''\n|-\n|1970\u20131973\n|align=left|'''Pandurii T\u00e2rgu Jiu'''\n|-\n|1973\u20131975\n|align=left|''Cimentul T\u00e2rgu Jiu''\n|-\n|1975\u20131976\n|align=left|''Cimentul Victoria T\u00e2rgu Jiu''\n|-\n|1976\u20131985\n|align=left|'''Pandurii T\u00e2rgu Jiu'''\n|-\n|1985\u20131988\n|align=left|''Gloria Pandurii T\u00e2rgu Jiu''\n|-\n|1988\u2013present\n|align=left|'''Pandurii T\u00e2rgu Jiu'''\n|}\n\nIn the [[2011\u201312 Liga I|2011\u201312 season]] the team reached the highest place in history, finishing seventh.

After defeating [[FC Levadia Tallinn|Levadia Tallinn]], [[Hapoel Tel Aviv F.C.|Hapoel Tel Aviv]] and [[S.C.

On their way to play the final they beat one of the Romanian giants [[FC Petrolul Ploie\u0219ti]] at [[Ilie Oan\u0103 Stadium]]. In the final [[FC Steaua Bucure\u0219ti]] beat Pandurii at [[Arena Na\u021bional\u0103]] stadium but with a controversial penalty in the beginning of the match.\n\nIn the [[2015\u201316 Liga I|2015\u201316]], season of [[Liga I]] Pandurii had many achievements along the season with the same coach and players like [[UEFA Europa League]] winner [[Cristian S\u0103punaru]], [[Dan Nistor]], [[Ioan Hora]] and [[Mihai R\u0103du\u021b]] and [[Narcis R\u0103ducan]] as president. In April 2015 they became the first team to win a match in [[Liga I]] with the new play-off, play-out system. On 6 February 2016, they secured both a place in the competition play-offs and a place in a European competition next year with a victory with [[ASA 2013 T\u00e2rgu Mure\u0219]]. During this season they had the most matches without a defeat, about 10 games. At the end of the season, Pandurii finished on the podium as third-place qualifying for the second time in UEFA Europa League, but this time in the third qualifying round.\n\n===Back to the lower leagues (2017\u2013present)===\n\nAlthough the team had a fairly good start for the season [[2016\u201317 Liga I|2016\u201317]], with players like [[Lucian S\u00e2nm\u0103rtean]] or [[George \u021aucudean]] coming at the club, and playing in the summer against [[Maccabi Tel Aviv F.C.]] in Europa League, problems occurred in the second half of the season. The main sponsor started having problems and for this reason they did not fund the team anymore. Many players have left the team so the young players from the second team where brought to the first team along with other players from elsewhere.  Unfortunately after 12 seasons in Liga 1 Pandurii relegated for the first time since the 2005 promotion but fought to avoid it until the last round.\n\nFor the [[2017\u201318 Liga II|2017\u201318]] [[Liga II]], Pandurii has been prepared with some players promoted from the second team or from the youth teams and moved to [[Motru]] until the new stadium was completed.\n\n==Ground==\n{{Main|Stadionul Tudor Vladimirescu (2019)}} \nThe club play its matches at the new [[Stadionul Tudor Vladimirescu (2019)|Tudor Vladimirescu Stadium]], opened in 2019.\n\n==Honours==\n\n===Domestic===\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!colspan=2| Honour\n!

Domestically, ''Gorjenii'' have never won any major honour, but finished as runners-up in the league at the end of the [[2012\u201313 Liga I|2012\u201313 season]] and lost a [[Cupa Ligii|League Cup]] final in [[2014\u201315 Cupa Ligii|2015]]. They qualified for the very first time in a European competition in 2013, playing in the [[UEFA Europa League]] and reaching the group stage.\n\nThe colors of the team are white and blue.\n\n==History==\n[[File:Pandurii T\u00e2rgu Jiu League Performance.svg|thumb|right|290px|Chart of yearly table positions of Pandurii T\u00e2rgu Jiu in the national leagues.]]\n\n===Founding and lower divisions (1962\u20132005)===\nPandurii T\u00e2rgu Jiu was founded in August 1962, after the merger of the two big rivals from the town, ''Flac\u0103ra-Unirea T\u00e2rgu Jiu'' and ''CIL T\u00e2rgu-Jiu''. The club entered the [[Divizia D|fourth division of Romanian football]], with a strong objective, to promote immediately in the third division. And the target was reached, Pandurii gaining the promotion to [[Divizia C]] in June 1963. Their first game in this division was played on 1 September 1963, against Siderurgistul Hunedoara. Pandurii won by a big margin, 6\u20130, goals scored by Chi\u021bu (12'), Nelu B\u0103loi (35'), Melinte (53', 80') and Vasilescu (83', 85').\n\nIn the first years, Pandurii finished constantly in the first half of the standings, so the club decided to attack a promotion to [[Liga II|Divizia B]]. In the 1976\u201377 season, with a young team and with [[Titus Ozon]] as coach, the dream came true. Pandurii dominated the competition, climbed from the first stages on top of the standings and won the promotion to the second division. But this level was a much bigger hat to wear for Pandurii, who relegated the next season back to Divizia C.\n\nThe following years, the team changed frequently the division, promoting to Divizia B and relegating after a few years. They played in Divizia B between 1979 and 1983 then between 1986 and 1991. After a decade in Divizia C, in 2000 the team promoted again in the second league, and in [[2003\u201304 Divizia B|2004]] finished second, behind [[FC Sportul Studen\u021besc Bucure\u0219ti|Sportul Studen\u021besc]].\n\n===Beginning years in the top league (2005\u20132011)=== \nThe performance from the last seasons was an incentive for the management who decided to push for the first presence of Pandurii in [[Divizia A]]. With [[Emil S\u0103ndoi]] as coach, and with a young group of players like Tiberiu Lung and Sorin Vintilescu but also with some experienced players like, [[Florin Popete]], [[Robert Vancea]] and [[Romulus Buia]], the team won the promotion.\n\nIt was difficult to maintain its position in Divizia A, and Pandurii finished their [[2005\u201306 Divizia A|first season]] in the 15th place, right below the relegation line. But the [[Romanian Football Federation]] decided at the end of the season not to give [[Sportul Studen\u021besc]] their licence for the following year, and kept instead the first team under the line, Pandurii. With the bullet dodged, the management decided to enforce the team, so the relegation shouldn't be a problem.\n\n[[Alexandru P\u0103curar]], [[Ciprian Vasilache]] and [[Liviu Mihai]] were brought, and the team finished 11th in the [[2006\u201307 Liga I|2006\u201307 season]]. They kept their position at the middle of the table for the next seasons.\n\nIn [[2009\u201310 Liga I|2010]], they finished below the line but avoided the relegation after the withdrawal of [[FC Interna\u021bional Curtea de Arge\u0219|Interna\u021bional Curtea de Arge\u0219]], team that ended tenth but the owner decided to disband the club. With a lot of players from Interna\u021bional Curtea de Arge\u0219 like [[Vlad Chiriche\u0219]], [[Mihai Pintilii]], and [[Dan Nistor]], Pandurii were 13th the [[2010\u201311 Liga I|following season]].\n\n===Ascent and first European participation (2011\u20132013)===\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: left\" align=\"right\"\n|-\n|style=\"background:#0094da;color:white;border:1px solid black\"|Period\n|style=\"background:#0094da;color:white;border:1px solid black\"|Name<ref>http://www.romaniansoccer.ro/stiri/16668/evolutia-denumirilor-echipelor-de-a-lungul-anilor.htm</ref>\n|-\n|1963\u20131965\n|align=left|'''Pandurii T\u00e2rgu Jiu'''\n|-\n|1965\u20131970\n|align=left|''Victoria T\u00e2rgu Jiu''\n|-\n|1970\u20131973\n|align=left|'''Pandurii T\u00e2rgu Jiu'''\n|-\n|1973\u20131975\n|align=left|''Cimentul T\u00e2rgu Jiu''\n|-\n|1975\u20131976\n|align=left|''Cimentul Victoria T\u00e2rgu Jiu''\n|-\n|1976\u20131985\n|align=left|'''Pandurii T\u00e2rgu Jiu'''\n|-\n|1985\u20131988\n|align=left|''Gloria Pandurii T\u00e2rgu Jiu''\n|-\n|1988\u2013present\n|align=left|'''Pandurii T\u00e2rgu Jiu'''\n|}\n\nIn the [[2011\u201312 Liga I|2011\u201312 season]] the team reached the highest place in history, finishing seventh.

After defeating [[FC Levadia Tallinn|Levadia Tallinn]], [[Hapoel Tel Aviv F.C.|Hapoel Tel Aviv]] and [[S.C.

On their way to play the final they beat one of the Romanian giants [[FC Petrolul Ploie\u0219ti]] at [[Ilie Oan\u0103 Stadium]]. In the final [[FC Steaua Bucure\u0219ti]] beat Pandurii at [[Arena Na\u021bional\u0103]] stadium but with a controversial penalty in the beginning of the match.\n\nIn the [[2015\u201316 Liga I|2015\u201316]], season of [[Liga I]] Pandurii had many achievements along the season with the same coach and players like [[UEFA Europa League]] winner [[Cristian S\u0103punaru]], [[Dan Nistor]], [[Ioan Hora]] and [[Mihai R\u0103du\u021b]] and [[Narcis R\u0103ducan]] as president. In April 2015 they became the first team to win a match in [[Liga I]] with the new play-off, play-out system. On 6 February 2016, they secured both a place in the competition play-offs and a place in a European competition next year with a victory with [[ASA 2013 T\u00e2rgu Mure\u0219]]. During this season they had the most matches without a defeat, about 10 games. At the end of the season, Pandurii finished on the podium as third-place qualifying for the second time in UEFA Europa League, but this time in the third qualifying round.\n\n===Back to the lower leagues (2017\u2013present)===\n\nAlthough the team had a fairly good start for the season [[2016\u201317 Liga I|2016\u201317]], with players like [[Lucian S\u00e2nm\u0103rtean]] or [[George \u021aucudean]] coming at the club, and playing in the summer against [[Maccabi Tel Aviv F.C.]] in Europa League, problems occurred in the second half of the season. The main sponsor started having problems and for this reason they did not fund the team anymore. Many players have left the team so the young players from the second team where brought to the first team along with other players from elsewhere.

Each division is headed by a ''Commissioner,'' appointed by the Fijian government.  \n\nThe divisions are basically agglomerations of provinces and have few administrative functions of their own, but serve to foster cooperation among the member provinces for providing services.\n\n== Provincial council ==\nEach province has a ''provincial council'' which may make bylaws and impose rates (local taxes), subject to the approval of the [[Fijian Affairs Board]], a government department.  The board must also approve the appointment of the ''Roko Tui,'' or executive head of the provincial council, who is usually a [[Ratu|high chief]], although in recent years, commoners have sometimes been chosen.\n[[Image:Fiji divisions named.png|left|thumb|Map of the divisions of Fiji.]]\n\nThe provinces used to have direct input into national affairs through the [[Great Council of Chiefs]] and the [[Senate of Fiji|Senate]].  The Great Council of Chiefs was a traditional body which advised the government on indigenous affairs and also functioned as an [[electoral college]] to elect the [[President of Fiji|President]] and [[Vice-President of Fiji|Vice-President]]; 42 of the 55 members of the Great Council were chosen by the provincial councils, three from each province.  In addition, 14 of the 32 members of the Senate, the upper house of the Fijian [[Parliament of Fiji|Parliament]], were chosen by the provincial councils (one Senator each) and confirmed by the Great Council of Chiefs. The [[Republic of Fiji Military Forces|Military]]-backed interim government that seized power in a [[2006 Fijian coup d'\u00e9tat|military coup]] on 5 December 2006 formally abolished the Great Council of Chiefs in 2012, and the [[2013 Constitution of Fiji|2013 Constitution]] promulgated by the regime similarly abolished the Senate. This effectively ended provincial input into national government affairs.\n\n== Island of Rotuma ==\nAdditionally, the island of [[Rotuma]], north of the main archipelago, is self-governing according to the Rotuma Act promulgated in 1927.  The Fiji government includes it in the Eastern Division for statistical purposes (such as the [[census]]), but it has its own [[Council of Rotuma|council]] which is empowered to legislate on most local matters.  Like a province, Rotuma used to choose (through its council) 3 members of the Great Council of Chiefs and 1 Senator.\n\n== Provincial administration ==\nBelow the provincial level, districts and villages, based on extended family networks, have their own chiefs and councils. [[Fijians|Indigenous Fijian]] administration is based on the ''koro,'' or village, headed by a ''Turaga ni Koro'' elected or appointed by the villagers.  Several koros combine to form a ''Tikina,'' two or more of which comprise a province.  In addition, [[municipal]] governments have been established for the [[City|cities]] of [[Suva]] and [[Lautoka]], and for ten [[town]]s.  Each has a city or town council [[Municipal elections in Fiji|elected for a three-year term]], presided over by a [[Mayor]] chosen by the councillors from among their own members. On 15 February 2006 the government announced legislation to change the local government term of office from three years to four.\n\nProvincial administration, and its sub divisions, cater for ethnic Fijians, town and city councils cater for urban residents of all races. Local authorities have also been established for rural areas, with advisory powers and these provide a voice to people of all races outside the provincial structure. The Ministry of Regional Development ensures that Fiji's rural areas are provided with the access to opportunities and basic amenities that are enjoyed by the urban areas. This is done through its district administrations which are involved in community capacity building, coordinating the development projects like upgrading of rural roads, upgrading of cane access roads, development or roads for access to cash crops and other capital programs in their respective districts. They also attend to some statutory functions such as registration of births, deaths and marriages, liquor licences and acting as Third Class Magistrates.\n\n== Districts ==\nFiji is divided into 17 districts, each with a district officer and five sub-districts with assistant district officers. The districts generally centre on towns and cities, but some follow provincial or tikina boundaries. The districts are: Ra, [[Tavua District, Fiji|Tavua]], [[Ba District, Fiji|Ba]], [[Nadi District, Fiji|Nadi]], Nadarivatu, Keiyasi, Nausori, [[Navua District, Fiji|Navua]], Vunidawa, Suva, Korovou, Macuata, Savusavu, [[Bua District|Bua]], [[Taveuni District|Taveuni]], Seqaqa, Saqani, Tukavesi, [[Kadavu District|Kadavu]], Rotuma, [[Lomaiviti District|Lomaiviti]], [[Lautoka District|Lautoka]].

At that time the land consisted of farms, [[market garden]]s and [[orchard]]s; there was a \"Heathrow Farm\" approximately where the modern Terminal 2 is situated, a \"Heathrow Hall\" and a \"Heathrow House.\" This hamlet was largely along a country lane (Heathrow Road), which ran roughly along the east and south edges of the present central terminals area.\n\nDevelopment of the whole Heathrow area as a much larger airport began in 1944. It was stated to be for long-distance military aircraft bound for the Far East; by the time the airfield was nearing completion, [[World War II]] had ended, and the UK Government continued to develop the airport as a civil airport. The airport was opened on 25 March 1946 as London Airport and was renamed Heathrow Airport in 1966. The layout for the airport was designed by [[Sir Frederick Gibberd]], who designed the original terminals and central area buildings, including the original control tower and the multi-faith Chapel of St George's.\n\n==Operations==\n===Facilities===\n[[File:TerminalFiveAirportHeathrowAugust2012.JPG|thumb|Central waiting area in [[Heathrow Terminal 5|Terminal 5]]]]\n[[File:Concorde g-boab in storage arp.jpg|thumb|[[Concorde]] G-BOAB in storage at Heathrow]]\n[[File:Four aircraft on the approach to LHR runway 09L 10Sep2015 arp.jpg|thumb|Four aircraft on the approach to Heathrow runway 09L]]\n[[File:London Heathrow tower and Virgin B747 (5048342074) (2).jpg|thumb|Heathrow's control tower with a departing [[Virgin Atlantic]] [[Boeing 747-400]] in the background.]]\n[[File:Heathrow Terminal 5C Iwelumo-1.jpg|thumb|British Airways aircraft at [[Heathrow Terminal 5|Terminal 5C]]]]\nHeathrow Airport is used by over 80 airlines flying to 185 destinations in 84 countries.

Of Heathrow's 78&nbsp;million passengers in 2017, 94% were international travellers; the remaining 6% were bound for (or arriving from) places in the UK.<ref name=Facts>{{cite web|url=http://www.heathrowairport.com/about-us/company-news-and-information/company-information/facts-and-figures|title=Facts and figures|publisher=Heathrow Airport|accessdate=13 March 2019|archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/6BvLjhZ76?url=http://www.heathrowairport.com/about-us/facts-and-figures|archive-date=4 November 2012|url-status=live}}</ref> The busiest single destination in passenger numbers is New York, with over 3&nbsp;million passengers flying between Heathrow and JFK Airport in 2013.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.caa.co.uk/docs/80/airport_data/2013Annual/Table_12_1_Intl_Air_Pax_Route_Analysis_2013.pdf|title=International Air Passenger Traffic To and From Reporting Airports for 2013|page=68|publisher=Civil Aviation Authority|accessdate=12 February 2015|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150704161033/https://www.caa.co.uk/docs/80/airport_data/2013Annual/Table_12_1_Intl_Air_Pax_Route_Analysis_2013.pdf |archivedate=4 July 2015|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nIn the 1950s, Heathrow had six runways, arranged in three pairs at different angles in the shape of a [[hexagram]] with the permanent passenger terminal in the middle and the older terminal along the north edge of the field; two of its runways would always be within 30\u00b0 of the wind direction. As the required length for runways has grown, Heathrow now has only two parallel runways running east\u2013west. These are extended versions of the two east\u2013west runways from the original hexagram. From the air, almost all of the original runways can still be seen, incorporated into the present system of taxiways.

Heathrow's two runways generally operate in segregated mode, whereby landings are allocated to one runway and takeoffs to the other. To further reduce noise nuisance to people beneath the approach and departure routes, the use of runways 27R and 27L is swapped at 15:00 each day if the wind is from the west. When landings are easterly there is no alternation; 09L remains the landing runway and 09R the takeoff runway due to the legacy of the now rescinded [[Cranford Agreement]], pending taxiway works to allow the roles to be reversed. Occasionally, landings are allowed on the nominated departure runway, to help reduce airborne delays and to position landing aircraft closer to their terminal, reducing taxi times.\n\nNight-time flights at Heathrow are subject to [[Night flying restrictions|restrictions]].

From 2003 to 2007 charges increased by inflation plus 6.5% per year, taking the fee to \u00a39.28 per passenger in 2007. In March 2008, the CAA announced that the charge would be allowed to increase by 23.5% to \u00a312.80 from 1 April 2008 and by inflation plus 7.5% for each of the following four years.<ref name=\"Ref_r\">{{cite news|title=IATA attacks higher landing charges at British airports|date=12 March 2008|agency=Agence France-Presse|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131102083857/https://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5izyYRsZKFHEIOR6WYbdtInUOLqgA?hl=en|archivedate=2 November 2013|url=http://afp.google.com/article/ALeqM5izyYRsZKFHEIOR6WYbdtInUOLqgA|accessdate=14 March 2008|url-status=dead}}</ref> In April 2013, the CAA announced a proposal for Heathrow to charge fees calculated by inflation minus 1.3%, continuing until 2019.<ref>{{cite news|title=Heathrow and Gatwick face new airline fee caps|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-22349054|work=BBC News|date=30 April 2013|accessdate=23 March 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181031150738/https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-22349054|archive-date=31 October 2018|url-status=live}}</ref> Whilst the cost of landing at Heathrow is determined by the CAA and Heathrow Airport Holdings, the allocation of [[landing slot]]s to airlines is carried out by Airport Co-ordination Limited (ACL).<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.heathrow.com/company/company-news-and-information/economic-regulation|title=Economic Regulation of Heathrow and Gatwick Airports 2008\u20132013|date=11 March 2008|publisher=Civil Aviation Authority|accessdate=23 March 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180324105703/https://www.heathrow.com/company/company-news-and-information/economic-regulation|archive-date=24 March 2018|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nUntil 2008, air traffic between Heathrow and the United States was strictly governed by the countries' bilateral [[Bermuda II Agreement|Bermuda II]] treaty. The treaty originally allowed only British Airways, [[Pan American World Airways|Pan Am]] and [[Trans World Airlines|TWA]] to fly from Heathrow to the US. In 1991, Pan Am and TWA sold their rights to [[United Airlines]] and [[American Airlines]] respectively, while Virgin Atlantic was added to the list of airlines allowed to operate on these routes. The Bermuda bilateral agreement conflicted with the Right of Establishment of the United Kingdom concerning its EU membership, and as a consequence, the UK was ordered to drop the agreement in 2004. A new \"[[EU\u2013US Open Skies Agreement|open skies]]\" agreement was signed by the United States and the [[European Union]] on 30 April 2007 and came into effect on 30 March 2008. Shortly afterward, additional US airlines, including [[Northwest Airlines]], [[Continental Airlines]], [[US Airways]] and [[Delta Air Lines]] started services to Heathrow.\n\nThe airport has been criticised in recent years for overcrowding and delays;<ref name=\"Ref_2007\">{{cite news |title=BA boss joins attack on Heathrow |work=BBC News |date=1 August 2007 |url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/6926150.stm |accessdate=28 October 2007}}</ref> according to Heathrow Airport Holdings, Heathrow's facilities were originally designed to accommodate 55&nbsp;million passengers annually.

During the two weeks after its opening, operations were disrupted by problems with the terminal's IT systems, coupled with insufficient testing and staff training, which caused over 500 flights to be cancelled.<ref name=\"Ref_2008c\">{{cite news|title=British Airways reveals what went wrong with Terminal 5|work=Computer Weekly|url=http://www.computerweekly.com/news/2240086013/British-Airways-reveals-what-went-wrong-with-Terminal-5|date=14 May 2008|accessdate=23 March 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180307033642/http://www.computerweekly.com/news/2240086013/British-Airways-reveals-what-went-wrong-with-Terminal-5|archive-date=7 March 2018|url-status=live}}</ref> Until March 2012, Terminal 5 was exclusively used by British Airways as its global hub; however, because of the merger, on 25 March [[Iberia (airline)|Iberia's]] operations at Heathrow were moved to the terminal, making it the home of [[International Airlines Group]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.businesstraveller.com/news/2012/02/08/iberia-to-move-to-heathrow-t5/|title=Iberia to move to Heathrow T5|date=8 February 2012|work=Business Traveller|accessdate=23 March 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171027232443/https://www.businesstraveller.com/news/2012/02/08/iberia-to-move-to-heathrow-t5/|archive-date=27 October 2017|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nBuilt at \u00a34.3&nbsp;billion, the terminal consists of a four-story main terminal building (Concourse A) and two satellite buildings linked to the main terminal by an underground [[people mover]] transit system.

The airport is located within the [[Hayes and Harlington (UK Parliament constituency)|Hayes and Harlington]] parliamentary constituency.\n\nAs the airport is located west of London and as its runways run east\u2013west, an airliner's landing approach is usually directly over the conurbation of London when the wind is from the west, which is most of the time.\n\nAlong with [[Gatwick Airport|Gatwick]], [[London Stansted Airport|Stansted]], [[Luton Airport|Luton]], [[London Southend Airport|Southend]] and [[London City Airport|London City]], Heathrow is one of six airports with scheduled services serving the London area.\n{{Clear left}}\n\n==History==\n[[File:Aerial photograph of Heathrow Airport, 1955.jpg|thumb|right|Aerial photo of Heathrow Airport from the 1950s, before the terminals were built]]\n[[File:EI-DWI LHR (7079539739).jpg|thumb|right|Heathrow in 2009, much expanded from its original layout.]]\n<!-- The history of Heathrow Airport is now described in [[History of Heathrow Airport]].

At that time the land consisted of farms, [[market garden]]s and [[orchard]]s; there was a \"Heathrow Farm\" approximately where the modern Terminal 2 is situated, a \"Heathrow Hall\" and a \"Heathrow House.\" This hamlet was largely along a country lane (Heathrow Road), which ran roughly along the east and south edges of the present central terminals area.\n\nDevelopment of the whole Heathrow area as a much larger airport began in 1944. It was stated to be for long-distance military aircraft bound for the Far East; by the time the airfield was nearing completion, [[World War II]] had ended, and the UK Government continued to develop the airport as a civil airport. The airport was opened on 25 March 1946 as London Airport and was renamed Heathrow Airport in 1966. The layout for the airport was designed by [[Sir Frederick Gibberd]], who designed the original terminals and central area buildings, including the original control tower and the multi-faith Chapel of St George's.\n\n==Operations==\n===Facilities===\n[[File:TerminalFiveAirportHeathrowAugust2012.JPG|thumb|Central waiting area in [[Heathrow Terminal 5|Terminal 5]]]]\n[[File:Concorde g-boab in storage arp.jpg|thumb|[[Concorde]] G-BOAB in storage at Heathrow]]\n[[File:Four aircraft on the approach to LHR runway 09L 10Sep2015 arp.jpg|thumb|Four aircraft on the approach to Heathrow runway 09L]]\n[[File:London Heathrow tower and Virgin B747 (5048342074) (2).jpg|thumb|Heathrow's control tower with a departing [[Virgin Atlantic]] [[Boeing 747-400]] in the background.]]\n[[File:Heathrow Terminal 5C Iwelumo-1.jpg|thumb|British Airways aircraft at [[Heathrow Terminal 5|Terminal 5C]]]]\nHeathrow Airport is used by over 80 airlines flying to 185 destinations in 84 countries. The airport is the primary [[Airline hub|hub]] of British Airways and is a base for [[Virgin Atlantic]]. It has four passenger terminals (numbered 2 to 5) and a cargo terminal. Of Heathrow's 78&nbsp;million passengers in 2017, 94% were international travellers; the remaining 6% were bound for (or arriving from) places in the UK.<ref name=Facts>{{cite web|url=http://www.heathrowairport.com/about-us/company-news-and-information/company-information/facts-and-figures|title=Facts and figures|publisher=Heathrow Airport|accessdate=13 March 2019|archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/6BvLjhZ76?url=http://www.heathrowairport.com/about-us/facts-and-figures|archive-date=4 November 2012|url-status=live}}</ref> The busiest single destination in passenger numbers is New York, with over 3&nbsp;million passengers flying between Heathrow and JFK Airport in 2013.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.caa.co.uk/docs/80/airport_data/2013Annual/Table_12_1_Intl_Air_Pax_Route_Analysis_2013.pdf|title=International Air Passenger Traffic To and From Reporting Airports for 2013|page=68|publisher=Civil Aviation Authority|accessdate=12 February 2015|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150704161033/https://www.caa.co.uk/docs/80/airport_data/2013Annual/Table_12_1_Intl_Air_Pax_Route_Analysis_2013.pdf |archivedate=4 July 2015|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nIn the 1950s, Heathrow had six runways, arranged in three pairs at different angles in the shape of a [[hexagram]] with the permanent passenger terminal in the middle and the older terminal along the north edge of the field; two of its runways would always be within 30\u00b0 of the wind direction. As the required length for runways has grown, Heathrow now has only two parallel runways running east\u2013west. These are extended versions of the two east\u2013west runways from the original hexagram. From the air, almost all of the original runways can still be seen, incorporated into the present system of taxiways.

Heathrow's two runways generally operate in segregated mode, whereby landings are allocated to one runway and takeoffs to the other. To further reduce noise nuisance to people beneath the approach and departure routes, the use of runways 27R and 27L is swapped at 15:00 each day if the wind is from the west. When landings are easterly there is no alternation; 09L remains the landing runway and 09R the takeoff runway due to the legacy of the now rescinded [[Cranford Agreement]], pending taxiway works to allow the roles to be reversed. Occasionally, landings are allowed on the nominated departure runway, to help reduce airborne delays and to position landing aircraft closer to their terminal, reducing taxi times.\n\nNight-time flights at Heathrow are subject to [[Night flying restrictions|restrictions]]. Between 23:00 and 04:00, the noisiest aircraft (rated [[Quota Count system|QC]]/8 and QC/16) cannot be scheduled for operation. Also, during the night quota period (23:30\u201306:00) there are four limits:\n*A limit on the number of flights allowed;\n*A [[Quota Count system]] which limits the total amount of noise permitted, but allows operators to choose to operate fewer noisy aircraft or a greater number of quieter planes;<ref name=\"Ref_p\">{{cite web|title=Noise limits|url=http://www.heathrowairport.com/noise/what-we-do-about-it/measures-already-in-place/noise-limits|publisher=Heathrow Airport|accessdate=27 January 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121225040213/http://www.heathrowairport.com/noise/what-we-do-about-it/measures-already-in-place/noise-limits|archive-date=25 December 2012|url-status=live}}</ref>\n*QC/4 aircraft cannot be scheduled for operation.\n*A voluntary agreement with the airlines that no early morning arrivals will be scheduled to land before 04:30.\n\nA trial of \"noise relief zones\" ran from December 2012 to March 2013, which concentrated approach flight paths into defined areas compared with the existing paths which were spread out.

The treaty originally allowed only British Airways, [[Pan American World Airways|Pan Am]] and [[Trans World Airlines|TWA]] to fly from Heathrow to the US. In 1991, Pan Am and TWA sold their rights to [[United Airlines]] and [[American Airlines]] respectively, while Virgin Atlantic was added to the list of airlines allowed to operate on these routes. The Bermuda bilateral agreement conflicted with the Right of Establishment of the United Kingdom concerning its EU membership, and as a consequence, the UK was ordered to drop the agreement in 2004. A new \"[[EU\u2013US Open Skies Agreement|open skies]]\" agreement was signed by the United States and the [[European Union]] on 30 April 2007 and came into effect on 30 March 2008.

Classical Chinese is a traditional style of [[written Chinese]] that evolved from the classical language, making it different from any modern [[Chinese spoken language|spoken form of Chinese]]. Literary Chinese was used for almost all formal writing in [[China]] until the early 20th century, and also, during various periods, in [[Japan]], [[Korea]] and [[Vietnam]]. Among Chinese speakers, Literary Chinese has been largely replaced by [[written vernacular Chinese]], a style of writing that is similar to modern spoken [[Mandarin Chinese]], while speakers of non-Chinese languages have largely abandoned Literary Chinese in favor of local vernaculars.\n\nLiterary Chinese is known as ''{{lang|ja-Latn|[[kanbun]]}}'' ({{lang|ja|\u6f22\u6587}}) in Japanese, ''{{lang|ko-Latn|[[hanmun]]}}'' in Korean (but see also ''{{lang|ko-Latn|[[gugyeol]]}}'') and ''{{lang|vi|c\u1ed5 v\u0103n}}'' ({{lang|vi-Hani|\u53e4\u6587}})<ref name=\"Nguy\u1ec5n Tri T\u00e0i 2002 p5\">{{cite book |last=Nguy\u1ec5n |first=Tri T\u00e0i |date=2002 |title=Gi\u00e1o tr\u00ecnh ti\u1ebfng H\u00e1n.

It is often also referred to as \"Classical Chinese\", but [[Sinology|sinologists]] generally distinguish it from the language of the early period. During this period the dialects of China became more and more disparate and thus the Classical written language became less and less representative of the [[varieties of Chinese]] (cf. [[Classical Latin]], which was contemporary to the Han Dynasty, and the [[Romance languages]] of Europe). Although authors sought to write in the style of the Classics, the similarity decreased over the centuries due to their imperfect understanding of the older language, the influence of their own speech, and the addition of new words.<ref>Norman (1988), pp. 83\u201384, 108\u2013109.</ref>\n\nThis situation, the [[adoption of Chinese literary culture|use of Literary Chinese throughout the Chinese cultural sphere]] despite the existence of disparate regional vernaculars, is called [[diglossia]].  It can be compared to the position of [[Classical Arabic]] relative to the various [[Varieties of Arabic|regional vernaculars]] in Arab lands, or of [[Latin]] in medieval Europe. The Romance languages continued to evolve, influencing Latin texts of the same period, so that by the [[Middle Ages]], [[Medieval Latin]] included many usages that would have baffled the [[Ancient Rome|Romans]]. The coexistence of Classical Chinese and the native languages of Japan, Korea and Vietnam can be compared to the use of Latin in nations that natively speak non-Latin-derived [[Germanic languages]] or [[Slavic languages]], to the position of Arabic in [[Persia]] or the position of the Indic language, [[Sanskrit]], in South India and Southeast Asia. However, the non-phonetic [[Chinese characters|Chinese writing system]] causes a unique situation where the modern pronunciation of the classical language is far more divergent (and heterogeneous, depending on the native \u2013 not necessarily Chinese \u2013 tongue of the reader) than in analogous cases, complicating understanding and study of Classical Chinese further compared to other classical languages.\n\nChristian missionaries coined the term Wen-li ({{zh|t=\u6587\u7406|p=w\u00e9nl\u01d0|w=wen-li}}) for Literary Chinese.\nThough composed from Chinese roots, this term was never used in that sense in Chinese,<ref>{{cite book\n | title = Aspects of Chinese sociolinguistics: essays by Yuen Ren Chao\n | author-link = Chao Yuen Ren\n | last = Chao | first = Yuen Ren\n | publisher = Stanford University Press\n | year = 1976\n | isbn = 978-0-8047-0909-5\n | page = 25\n | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=Ky6sAAAAIAAJ&pg=PA25\n }}</ref>\nand was rejected by non-missionary sinologues.<ref>{{cite book\n|url=https://books.google.com/books?ei=_mdFT8LWHYL10gG74I3qAw&id=dsF7AAAAMAAJ&dq=2+The+invitation+to+the+conference+still+called+for+a+standard+classic+version+%28+DuBose+in+Chinese+Recorder+1877%2C+533%29.+1+The+term+%22Wenli%22+%28%27%24CW%29+was+%22an+English+word+derived+from+Chinese+roots+but+never+used+by+the+Chinese%22+%28Yuen+1976%2C&q=term+derived+roots\n|title=The Bible in China: the history of the Union Version or the culmination of protestant missionary Bible translation in China\n|year=1999\n|author=Jost Oliver Zetzsche\n|publisher=Monumenta Serica Institute\n|isbn=3-8050-0433-8\n|quote=The term \"Wenli\" (\u6587\u7406) was \"an English word derived from Chinese roots but never used by the Chinese\" (Yuen 1976, 25).

Today, they are pronounced ''r\u00e9n'' and ''ni\u00e1n'' in Mandarin, but their hypothesized pronunciations in [[Old Chinese]] were very similar, which may explain the resemblance.  For example, in the recent [[Reconstructions of Old Chinese#Baxter\u2013Sagart (2014)|Baxter-Sagart reconstruction]]<ref>http://ocbaxtersagart.lsait.lsa.umich.edu/</ref>, they were {{IPA|/ni\u014b/}} and {{IPA|/n\u02e4i\u014b/}}, respectively, becoming {{IPA|/n\u02b2in/}} and {{IPA|/nin/}} in [[Early Middle Chinese]].]]\n[[Chinese character]]s are not [[alphabet|alphabetic]] and only rarely reflect [[sound changes]].  The tentative reconstruction of [[Old Chinese]] is an endeavor only a few centuries old. As a result, Classical Chinese is not read with a reconstruction of Old Chinese pronunciation; instead, it is always read with the pronunciations of characters categorized and listed in the Phonology Dictionary (\u97fb\u66f8; [[pinyin]]: ''y\u00f9nsh\u016b'', \"[[Rime dictionary|rhyme book]]\") officially published by the Governments, originally based upon the Middle Chinese pronunciation of [[Luoyang]] in the 2nd to 4th centuries.  With the progress of time, every dynasty has updated and modified the official Phonology Dictionary.  By the time of the [[Yuan Dynasty]] and [[Ming Dynasty]], the Phonology Dictionary was based on early Mandarin.  But since the [[Imperial Examination]] required the composition of [[Shi (poetry)|Shi]] genre, in non-Mandarin speaking parts of China such as [[Zhejiang]], [[Guangdong]] and [[Fujian]], pronunciation is either based on everyday speech as in [[Standard Cantonese|Cantonese]]; or, in some varieties of Chinese (e.g. [[Southern Min]]), with a special set of pronunciations used for Classical Chinese or \"formal\" vocabulary and usage borrowed from Classical Chinese usage.  In practice, all varieties of Chinese combine these two extremes. Mandarin and Cantonese, for example, also have words that are pronounced one way in colloquial usage and another way when used in Classical Chinese or in specialized terms coming from Classical Chinese, though the system is not as extensive as that of Southern Min or [[Wu Chinese|Wu]]. (See [[Literary and colloquial readings of Chinese characters]])\n\n[[Japanese language|Japanese]],  [[Korean language|Korean]] or [[Vietnamese language|Vietnamese]] readers of Classical Chinese use systems of pronunciation specific to their own languages. For example, Japanese speakers use ''On'yomi'' pronunciation when reading the [[kanji]] of words of Chinese origin such as \u9280\u884c (gink\u014d) or the name for the city of T\u014dky\u014d (\u6771\u4eac), but use ''Kun'yomi'' when the kanji represents a native word such as the reading of \u884c in \u884c\u304f (iku) or the reading of both characters in the name for the city of \u014csaka (\u5927\u962a), and a system that aids Japanese speakers with Classical Chinese word order.\n\nSince the pronunciation of all modern varieties of Chinese is different from Old Chinese or other forms of historical Chinese (such as [[Middle Chinese]]), characters that once [[rhyme]]d in poetry may not rhyme any longer, or vice versa. Poetry and other rhyme-based writing thus becomes less coherent than the original reading must have been. However, some modern [[varieties of Chinese|Chinese varieties]] have certain phonological characteristics that are closer to the older pronunciations than others, as shown by the preservation of certain rhyme structures. Some{{who|date=October 2019}} believe Classical Chinese literature, especially poetry, sounds better when read in certain varieties that are believed to be closer to older pronunciations, such as Cantonese or Southern Min, because the rhyming is often lost due to sound shifts in [[Standard Chinese|Mandarin]].\n\nAnother phenomenon that is common in reading Classical Chinese is [[homophone|homophony]] (words that sound the same). More than 2,500 years of sound change separates Classical Chinese from any modern variety, so when reading Classical Chinese in any modern variety of Chinese (especially Mandarin) or in Japanese, Korean, or Vietnamese, many characters which originally had different pronunciations have become [[homonym]]s. There is a famous Classical Chinese poem written in the early 20th century by the linguist [[Chao Yuen Ren]] called the ''[[Lion-Eating Poet in the Stone Den]]'', which contains only words that are now pronounced {{IPA-cmn|\u0282\u0268|}} with various tones in [[Standard Chinese|Mandarin]]. It was written to show how Classical Chinese has become an impractical language for speakers of modern Chinese because Classical Chinese when spoken aloud is largely incomprehensible. However the poem is perfectly comprehensible when read silently because Literary Chinese, by its very nature as a ''written'' language using a [[logographic]] writing system, can often get away with using homophones that even in spoken Old Chinese would not have been distinguishable in any way.\n\nThe situation is analogous to that of some English words that are spelled differently but sound the same, such as \"meet\" and \"meat\", which were pronounced {{IPA-enm|me\u02d0t|}} and {{IPA|[m\u025b\u02d0t]}} respectively during the time of [[Chaucer]], as shown by their spelling. However, such homophones are far more common in Literary Chinese than in English. For example, the following distinct Old Chinese words are now all pronounced ''y\u00ec'' in Mandarin: ''*\u014bjajs'' \u8b70 \"discuss\", ''*\u014bj\u0259t'' \u4ee1 \"powerful\", ''*\u0294jup'' \u9091 \"city\", ''*\u0294j\u0259k'' \u5104 \"100,000,000\", ''*\u0294j\u0259ks'' \u610f \"thought\", ''*\u0294jek'' \u76ca \"increase\", ''*\u0294jik'' \u6291 \"press down\", ''*jak'' \u5f08 \"Chinese chess\", ''*ljit'' \u9038 \"flee\", ''*lj\u0259k'' \u7ffc \"wing\", ''*ljek'' \u6613 \"change\", ''*ljeks'' \u6613 \"easy\" and ''*slek'' \u8734 \"lizard\".<ref>{{cite book\n  | title = A Handbook of Old Chinese Phonology\n  | first = William H. | last = Baxter | authorlink = William H.

An essay in Classical Chinese, for example, might use half as many [[Chinese character]]s as in vernacular Chinese to relate the same content.\n\nIn terms of conciseness and compactness, Classical Chinese rarely uses words composed of two Chinese characters; nearly all words are of one [[syllable]] only. This stands directly in contrast with modern Northern Chinese varieties including Mandarin, in which two-syllable, three-syllable, and four-syllable words are extremely common, whilst although two-syllable words are also quite common within modern Southern Chinese varieties, they are still more archaic in that they use more one-syllable words than Northern Chinese varieties. This phenomenon exists, in part, because polysyllabic words evolved in Chinese to disambiguate homophones that result from sound changes. This is similar to such phenomena in English as the [[pin\u2013pen merger|''pen\u2013pin'' merger]] of many dialects in the American south and the [[Cot\u2013caught merger|''caught-cot'' merger]] of most dialects of American English: because the words \"pin\" and \"pen\", as well as \"caught\" and \"cot\", sound alike in such dialects of English, a certain degree of confusion can occur unless one adds qualifiers like \"ink pen\" and \"stick pin.\" Similarly, Chinese has acquired many polysyllabic words in order to disambiguate monosyllabic words that sounded different in earlier forms of Chinese but identical in one region or another during later periods. Because Classical Chinese is based on the literary examples of ancient Chinese literature, it has almost none of the two-syllable words present in modern Chinese varieties.\n\nClassical Chinese has more [[pronoun]]s compared to the modern vernacular. In particular, whereas Mandarin has one general character to refer to the first-person pronoun (\"I\"/\"me\"), Literary Chinese has several, many of which are used as part of [[honorific]] language (see [[Chinese honorifics]]).\n\nIn [[syntax]], Classical Chinese is always ready to drop subjects and objects when a reference to them is understood ([[Pro-drop language|pragmatically inferable]]). Also, words are not restrictively categorized into [[parts of speech]]: nouns are commonly used as verbs, adjectives as nouns, and so on. There is no [[copula (linguistics)|copula]] in Classical Chinese, \"\u662f\" ([[pinyin]]: ''sh\u00ec'') is a copula in modern Chinese but in old Chinese it was originally a near [[demonstrative]] (\"this\"); the modern Chinese for \"this\" is \"\u9019\" ([[pinyin]]: ''zh\u00e8'').\n\nBeyond grammar and vocabulary differences, Classical Chinese can be distinguished by literary and cultural differences: an effort to maintain [[parallelism (grammar)|parallelism]] and rhythm, even in prose works, and extensive use of literary and cultural allusions, thereby also contributing to brevity.\n\nMany final particles (\u6b47\u8a9e\u5b57 ''xi\u0113y\u01d4z\u00ec'') and interrogative particles are found in Literary Chinese.<ref>{{cite book\n|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kGFkAAAAMAAJ&q=wen+li+styl+particularly+so+called+abounds\n|title=Introduction to Literary Chinese\n|year=1936\n|author=J.

Classical Chinese was used to write the [[Hunmin Jeongeum]] proclamation in which the modern Korean alphabet ([[hangul]]) was promulgated and the essay by [[Hu Shih]] in which he argued against using Classical Chinese and in favor of [[written vernacular Chinese]].  (The latter parallels [[De vulgari eloquentia|the essay]] written by [[Dante]] in ''Latin'' in which he expounded the virtues of the vernacular ''Italian''.)  Exceptions to the use of Classical Chinese were vernacular novels such as ''[[Dream of the Red Chamber]]''.\n\nMost government documents in the [[Republic of China]] were written in Classical Chinese until reforms in the 1970s, in a reform movement spearheaded by President [[Yen Chia-kan]] to shift the written style to [[vernacular Chinese]].<ref>{{cite book|first=Feng-fu|last=Tsao|chapter=The language planning situation in Taiwan|pages=60\u2013106|editor1-last=Baldauf|editor1-first=Richard B.|editor2-first=Robert B.|editor2-last=Kaplan|title=Language planning in Nepal, Taiwan, and Sweden|publisher=Multilingual Matters|year=2000|volume=115|isbn=978-1-85359-483-0}} pages 75\u201376.</ref><ref>{{cite book|last=Cheong|first=Ching|title=Will Taiwan break away: the rise of Taiwanese nationalism|publisher=World Scientific|year=2001|pages=187|isbn=978-981-02-4486-6}}</ref>\n\nToday, pure Classical Chinese is occasionally used in formal or ceremonial occasions. The ''[[National Anthem of the Republic of China]]'' (\u4e2d\u83ef\u6c11\u570b\u570b\u6b4c), for example, is in Classical Chinese. [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] texts, or [[sutra]]s, are still preserved in Classical Chinese from the time they were composed or translated from [[Sanskrit]] sources.  In practice there is a socially accepted continuum between vernacular Chinese and Classical Chinese. For example, most official notices and formal letters are written with a number of stock Classical Chinese expressions (e.g. salutation, closing). Personal letters, on the other hand, are mostly written in vernacular, but with some Classical phrases, depending on the subject matter, the writer's level of education, etc. With the exception of professional scholars and enthusiasts, most people today cannot write in full Classical Chinese with ease.\n\nMost Chinese people with at least a middle school education are able to read basic Classical Chinese, because the ability to read (but not write) Classical Chinese is part of the Chinese [[middle school]] and [[High school (upper secondary)|high school]] [[curricula]] and is part of the college entrance examination. Classical Chinese is taught primarily by presenting a classical Chinese work and including a vernacular gloss that explains the meaning of phrases. Tests on classical Chinese usually ask the student to express the meaning of a paragraph in vernacular Chinese. They often take the form of comprehension questions.\n\nThe contemporary use of Classical Chinese in [[Japan]] is mainly in the field of education and the study of literature. Learning the Japanese way ([[kanbun]]) of decoding Classical Chinese is part of the [[High school (upper secondary)|high school]] curriculum in Japan.<ref>{{cite book| title =\u4e2d\u5b66\u6821 \u9ad8\u7b49\u5b66\u6821 \u5b66\u7fd2\u6307\u5c0e\u8981\u9818 \u56fd\u8a9e\u79d1\u7de8\uff08\u8a66\u6848\uff09| chapter =\u7b2c\u4e03\u7ae0 \u56fd\u8a9e\u79d1\u306b\u304a\u3051\u308b\u6f22\u6587\u306e\u5b66\u7fd2\u6307\u5c0e| url =http://www.nicer.go.jp/guideline/old/s27jhj2/| year =1951| author =\u6587\u90e8\u7701| url-status =dead| archiveurl =https://web.archive.org/web/20091215230001/http://www.nicer.go.jp/guideline/old/s27jhj2/| archivedate =2009-12-15}}</ref>\n\nClassical Chinese is not a part of middle school and high school [[curricula]] in the [[Korean peninsula]] and [[Vietnam]] nowadays.{{citation needed|date=January 2020}} The use of Classical Chinese in these regions is limited and is mainly in the field of [[Chinese classics|Classical studies]].\n\nIn addition, many works of [[literature]] in Classical Chinese (such as [[Tang poetry]]) have been major [[cultural]] influences.

[[Classical Latin]], which was contemporary to the Han Dynasty, and the [[Romance languages]] of Europe). Although authors sought to write in the style of the Classics, the similarity decreased over the centuries due to their imperfect understanding of the older language, the influence of their own speech, and the addition of new words.<ref>Norman (1988), pp. 83\u201384, 108\u2013109.</ref>\n\nThis situation, the [[adoption of Chinese literary culture|use of Literary Chinese throughout the Chinese cultural sphere]] despite the existence of disparate regional vernaculars, is called [[diglossia]].  It can be compared to the position of [[Classical Arabic]] relative to the various [[Varieties of Arabic|regional vernaculars]] in Arab lands, or of [[Latin]] in medieval Europe. The Romance languages continued to evolve, influencing Latin texts of the same period, so that by the [[Middle Ages]], [[Medieval Latin]] included many usages that would have baffled the [[Ancient Rome|Romans]]. The coexistence of Classical Chinese and the native languages of Japan, Korea and Vietnam can be compared to the use of Latin in nations that natively speak non-Latin-derived [[Germanic languages]] or [[Slavic languages]], to the position of Arabic in [[Persia]] or the position of the Indic language, [[Sanskrit]], in South India and Southeast Asia. However, the non-phonetic [[Chinese characters|Chinese writing system]] causes a unique situation where the modern pronunciation of the classical language is far more divergent (and heterogeneous, depending on the native \u2013 not necessarily Chinese \u2013 tongue of the reader) than in analogous cases, complicating understanding and study of Classical Chinese further compared to other classical languages.\n\nChristian missionaries coined the term Wen-li ({{zh|t=\u6587\u7406|p=w\u00e9nl\u01d0|w=wen-li}}) for Literary Chinese.\nThough composed from Chinese roots, this term was never used in that sense in Chinese,<ref>{{cite book\n | title = Aspects of Chinese sociolinguistics: essays by Yuen Ren Chao\n | author-link = Chao Yuen Ren\n | last = Chao | first = Yuen Ren\n | publisher = Stanford University Press\n | year = 1976\n | isbn = 978-0-8047-0909-5\n | page = 25\n | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=Ky6sAAAAIAAJ&pg=PA25\n }}</ref>\nand was rejected by non-missionary sinologues.<ref>{{cite book\n|url=https://books.google.com/books?ei=_mdFT8LWHYL10gG74I3qAw&id=dsF7AAAAMAAJ&dq=2+The+invitation+to+the+conference+still+called+for+a+standard+classic+version+%28+DuBose+in+Chinese+Recorder+1877%2C+533%29.+1+The+term+%22Wenli%22+%28%27%24CW%29+was+%22an+English+word+derived+from+Chinese+roots+but+never+used+by+the+Chinese%22+%28Yuen+1976%2C&q=term+derived+roots\n|title=The Bible in China: the history of the Union Version or the culmination of protestant missionary Bible translation in China\n|year=1999\n|author=Jost Oliver Zetzsche\n|publisher=Monumenta Serica Institute\n|isbn=3-8050-0433-8\n|quote=The term \"Wenli\" (\u6587\u7406) was \"an English word derived from Chinese roots but never used by the Chinese\" (Yuen 1976, 25).

For sinologues outside the missionary circle, the term \"wenli\" was not acceptable (\"... what the missionaries persist in calling wen li, meaning thereby the book language as opposed to the colloquial\"\u2014 Giles 1881/82, 151).\n|page=161\n}}</ref>\n\n== Pronunciation ==\n{{Further information|Old Chinese phonology|Middle Chinese}}\n[[Image:Old chinese.PNG|right|thumb|The shape of the [[Oracle bone script]] character for \"person\" may have influenced that for \"harvest\" (which later came to mean \"year\").  Today, they are pronounced ''r\u00e9n'' and ''ni\u00e1n'' in Mandarin, but their hypothesized pronunciations in [[Old Chinese]] were very similar, which may explain the resemblance.  For example, in the recent [[Reconstructions of Old Chinese#Baxter\u2013Sagart (2014)|Baxter-Sagart reconstruction]]<ref>http://ocbaxtersagart.lsait.lsa.umich.edu/</ref>, they were {{IPA|/ni\u014b/}} and {{IPA|/n\u02e4i\u014b/}}, respectively, becoming {{IPA|/n\u02b2in/}} and {{IPA|/nin/}} in [[Early Middle Chinese]].]]\n[[Chinese character]]s are not [[alphabet|alphabetic]] and only rarely reflect [[sound changes]].  The tentative reconstruction of [[Old Chinese]] is an endeavor only a few centuries old. As a result, Classical Chinese is not read with a reconstruction of Old Chinese pronunciation; instead, it is always read with the pronunciations of characters categorized and listed in the Phonology Dictionary (\u97fb\u66f8; [[pinyin]]: ''y\u00f9nsh\u016b'', \"[[Rime dictionary|rhyme book]]\") officially published by the Governments, originally based upon the Middle Chinese pronunciation of [[Luoyang]] in the 2nd to 4th centuries.  With the progress of time, every dynasty has updated and modified the official Phonology Dictionary.  By the time of the [[Yuan Dynasty]] and [[Ming Dynasty]], the Phonology Dictionary was based on early Mandarin.  But since the [[Imperial Examination]] required the composition of [[Shi (poetry)|Shi]] genre, in non-Mandarin speaking parts of China such as [[Zhejiang]], [[Guangdong]] and [[Fujian]], pronunciation is either based on everyday speech as in [[Standard Cantonese|Cantonese]]; or, in some varieties of Chinese (e.g. [[Southern Min]]), with a special set of pronunciations used for Classical Chinese or \"formal\" vocabulary and usage borrowed from Classical Chinese usage.  In practice, all varieties of Chinese combine these two extremes. Mandarin and Cantonese, for example, also have words that are pronounced one way in colloquial usage and another way when used in Classical Chinese or in specialized terms coming from Classical Chinese, though the system is not as extensive as that of Southern Min or [[Wu Chinese|Wu]]. (See [[Literary and colloquial readings of Chinese characters]])\n\n[[Japanese language|Japanese]],  [[Korean language|Korean]] or [[Vietnamese language|Vietnamese]] readers of Classical Chinese use systems of pronunciation specific to their own languages. For example, Japanese speakers use ''On'yomi'' pronunciation when reading the [[kanji]] of words of Chinese origin such as \u9280\u884c (gink\u014d) or the name for the city of T\u014dky\u014d (\u6771\u4eac), but use ''Kun'yomi'' when the kanji represents a native word such as the reading of \u884c in \u884c\u304f (iku) or the reading of both characters in the name for the city of \u014csaka (\u5927\u962a), and a system that aids Japanese speakers with Classical Chinese word order.\n\nSince the pronunciation of all modern varieties of Chinese is different from Old Chinese or other forms of historical Chinese (such as [[Middle Chinese]]), characters that once [[rhyme]]d in poetry may not rhyme any longer, or vice versa. Poetry and other rhyme-based writing thus becomes less coherent than the original reading must have been. However, some modern [[varieties of Chinese|Chinese varieties]] have certain phonological characteristics that are closer to the older pronunciations than others, as shown by the preservation of certain rhyme structures. Some{{who|date=October 2019}} believe Classical Chinese literature, especially poetry, sounds better when read in certain varieties that are believed to be closer to older pronunciations, such as Cantonese or Southern Min, because the rhyming is often lost due to sound shifts in [[Standard Chinese|Mandarin]].\n\nAnother phenomenon that is common in reading Classical Chinese is [[homophone|homophony]] (words that sound the same). More than 2,500 years of sound change separates Classical Chinese from any modern variety, so when reading Classical Chinese in any modern variety of Chinese (especially Mandarin) or in Japanese, Korean, or Vietnamese, many characters which originally had different pronunciations have become [[homonym]]s. There is a famous Classical Chinese poem written in the early 20th century by the linguist [[Chao Yuen Ren]] called the ''[[Lion-Eating Poet in the Stone Den]]'', which contains only words that are now pronounced {{IPA-cmn|\u0282\u0268|}} with various tones in [[Standard Chinese|Mandarin]]. It was written to show how Classical Chinese has become an impractical language for speakers of modern Chinese because Classical Chinese when spoken aloud is largely incomprehensible. However the poem is perfectly comprehensible when read silently because Literary Chinese, by its very nature as a ''written'' language using a [[logographic]] writing system, can often get away with using homophones that even in spoken Old Chinese would not have been distinguishable in any way.\n\nThe situation is analogous to that of some English words that are spelled differently but sound the same, such as \"meet\" and \"meat\", which were pronounced {{IPA-enm|me\u02d0t|}} and {{IPA|[m\u025b\u02d0t]}} respectively during the time of [[Chaucer]], as shown by their spelling. However, such homophones are far more common in Literary Chinese than in English. For example, the following distinct Old Chinese words are now all pronounced ''y\u00ec'' in Mandarin: ''*\u014bjajs'' \u8b70 \"discuss\", ''*\u014bj\u0259t'' \u4ee1 \"powerful\", ''*\u0294jup'' \u9091 \"city\", ''*\u0294j\u0259k'' \u5104 \"100,000,000\", ''*\u0294j\u0259ks'' \u610f \"thought\", ''*\u0294jek'' \u76ca \"increase\", ''*\u0294jik'' \u6291 \"press down\", ''*jak'' \u5f08 \"Chinese chess\", ''*ljit'' \u9038 \"flee\", ''*lj\u0259k'' \u7ffc \"wing\", ''*ljek'' \u6613 \"change\", ''*ljeks'' \u6613 \"easy\" and ''*slek'' \u8734 \"lizard\".<ref>{{cite book\n  | title = A Handbook of Old Chinese Phonology\n  | first = William H. | last = Baxter | authorlink = William H.

An essay in Classical Chinese, for example, might use half as many [[Chinese character]]s as in vernacular Chinese to relate the same content.\n\nIn terms of conciseness and compactness, Classical Chinese rarely uses words composed of two Chinese characters; nearly all words are of one [[syllable]] only. This stands directly in contrast with modern Northern Chinese varieties including Mandarin, in which two-syllable, three-syllable, and four-syllable words are extremely common, whilst although two-syllable words are also quite common within modern Southern Chinese varieties, they are still more archaic in that they use more one-syllable words than Northern Chinese varieties. This phenomenon exists, in part, because polysyllabic words evolved in Chinese to disambiguate homophones that result from sound changes. This is similar to such phenomena in English as the [[pin\u2013pen merger|''pen\u2013pin'' merger]] of many dialects in the American south and the [[Cot\u2013caught merger|''caught-cot'' merger]] of most dialects of American English: because the words \"pin\" and \"pen\", as well as \"caught\" and \"cot\", sound alike in such dialects of English, a certain degree of confusion can occur unless one adds qualifiers like \"ink pen\" and \"stick pin.\" Similarly, Chinese has acquired many polysyllabic words in order to disambiguate monosyllabic words that sounded different in earlier forms of Chinese but identical in one region or another during later periods. Because Classical Chinese is based on the literary examples of ancient Chinese literature, it has almost none of the two-syllable words present in modern Chinese varieties.\n\nClassical Chinese has more [[pronoun]]s compared to the modern vernacular. In particular, whereas Mandarin has one general character to refer to the first-person pronoun (\"I\"/\"me\"), Literary Chinese has several, many of which are used as part of [[honorific]] language (see [[Chinese honorifics]]).\n\nIn [[syntax]], Classical Chinese is always ready to drop subjects and objects when a reference to them is understood ([[Pro-drop language|pragmatically inferable]]). Also, words are not restrictively categorized into [[parts of speech]]: nouns are commonly used as verbs, adjectives as nouns, and so on. There is no [[copula (linguistics)|copula]] in Classical Chinese, \"\u662f\" ([[pinyin]]: ''sh\u00ec'') is a copula in modern Chinese but in old Chinese it was originally a near [[demonstrative]] (\"this\"); the modern Chinese for \"this\" is \"\u9019\" ([[pinyin]]: ''zh\u00e8'').\n\nBeyond grammar and vocabulary differences, Classical Chinese can be distinguished by literary and cultural differences: an effort to maintain [[parallelism (grammar)|parallelism]] and rhythm, even in prose works, and extensive use of literary and cultural allusions, thereby also contributing to brevity.\n\nMany final particles (\u6b47\u8a9e\u5b57 ''xi\u0113y\u01d4z\u00ec'') and interrogative particles are found in Literary Chinese.<ref>{{cite book\n|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kGFkAAAAMAAJ&q=wen+li+styl+particularly+so+called+abounds\n|title=Introduction to Literary Chinese\n|year=1936\n|author=J.

Classical Chinese was used to write the [[Hunmin Jeongeum]] proclamation in which the modern Korean alphabet ([[hangul]]) was promulgated and the essay by [[Hu Shih]] in which he argued against using Classical Chinese and in favor of [[written vernacular Chinese]].  (The latter parallels [[De vulgari eloquentia|the essay]] written by [[Dante]] in ''Latin'' in which he expounded the virtues of the vernacular ''Italian''.)  Exceptions to the use of Classical Chinese were vernacular novels such as ''[[Dream of the Red Chamber]]''.\n\nMost government documents in the [[Republic of China]] were written in Classical Chinese until reforms in the 1970s, in a reform movement spearheaded by President [[Yen Chia-kan]] to shift the written style to [[vernacular Chinese]].<ref>{{cite book|first=Feng-fu|last=Tsao|chapter=The language planning situation in Taiwan|pages=60\u2013106|editor1-last=Baldauf|editor1-first=Richard B.|editor2-first=Robert B.|editor2-last=Kaplan|title=Language planning in Nepal, Taiwan, and Sweden|publisher=Multilingual Matters|year=2000|volume=115|isbn=978-1-85359-483-0}} pages 75\u201376.</ref><ref>{{cite book|last=Cheong|first=Ching|title=Will Taiwan break away: the rise of Taiwanese nationalism|publisher=World Scientific|year=2001|pages=187|isbn=978-981-02-4486-6}}</ref>\n\nToday, pure Classical Chinese is occasionally used in formal or ceremonial occasions. The ''[[National Anthem of the Republic of China]]'' (\u4e2d\u83ef\u6c11\u570b\u570b\u6b4c), for example, is in Classical Chinese. [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] texts, or [[sutra]]s, are still preserved in Classical Chinese from the time they were composed or translated from [[Sanskrit]] sources.  In practice there is a socially accepted continuum between vernacular Chinese and Classical Chinese. For example, most official notices and formal letters are written with a number of stock Classical Chinese expressions (e.g. salutation, closing). Personal letters, on the other hand, are mostly written in vernacular, but with some Classical phrases, depending on the subject matter, the writer's level of education, etc. With the exception of professional scholars and enthusiasts, most people today cannot write in full Classical Chinese with ease.\n\nMost Chinese people with at least a middle school education are able to read basic Classical Chinese, because the ability to read (but not write) Classical Chinese is part of the Chinese [[middle school]] and [[High school (upper secondary)|high school]] [[curricula]] and is part of the college entrance examination. Classical Chinese is taught primarily by presenting a classical Chinese work and including a vernacular gloss that explains the meaning of phrases. Tests on classical Chinese usually ask the student to express the meaning of a paragraph in vernacular Chinese, using multiple choice. They often take the form of comprehension questions.\n\nThe contemporary use of Classical Chinese in [[Japan]] is mainly in the field of education and the study of literature. Learning the Japanese way ([[kanbun]]) of decoding Classical Chinese is part of the [[High school (upper secondary)|high school]] curriculum in Japan.<ref>{{cite book| title =\u4e2d\u5b66\u6821 \u9ad8\u7b49\u5b66\u6821 \u5b66\u7fd2\u6307\u5c0e\u8981\u9818 \u56fd\u8a9e\u79d1\u7de8\uff08\u8a66\u6848\uff09| chapter =\u7b2c\u4e03\u7ae0 \u56fd\u8a9e\u79d1\u306b\u304a\u3051\u308b\u6f22\u6587\u306e\u5b66\u7fd2\u6307\u5c0e| url =http://www.nicer.go.jp/guideline/old/s27jhj2/| year =1951| author =\u6587\u90e8\u7701| url-status =dead| archiveurl =https://web.archive.org/web/20091215230001/http://www.nicer.go.jp/guideline/old/s27jhj2/| archivedate =2009-12-15}}</ref>\n\nClassical Chinese is not a part of middle school and high school [[curricula]] in the [[Korean peninsula]] and [[Vietnam]] nowadays.{{citation needed|date=January 2020}} The use of Classical Chinese in these regions is limited and is mainly in the field of [[Chinese classics|Classical studies]].\n\nIn addition, many works of [[literature]] in Classical Chinese (such as [[Tang poetry]]) have been major [[cultural]] influences.

The Dearly dogs are now among 97 puppies who were kidnapped or legally purchased from various owners, with the intention of skinning them for their [[fur]]. Through the co-operation of animals and the \"Twilight barking\", the dogs are found in [[Suffolk]], England, and a rescue ensues.\n\n==Plot==\nPongo and Missis are a pair of [[Dalmatian (dog)|Dalmatian]]s who live with the newly married Mr. and Mrs. Dearly and their two nannies, Nanny Cook and Nanny Butler. Mr. Dearly is a \"financial wizard\" who has been granted lifelong tax exemption and lent a house on the Outer Circle in [[Regent's Park]] in return for wiping out the [[government debt]]. The dogs consider the humans their pets, but allow the humans to think that they are the owners.\n\nMissis gives birth to a litter of 15 puppies. Concerned that Missis will not be able to feed them all, the humans join in to help. As Mrs. Dearly looks for a canine [[wet nurse]], she finds an exhausted liver-spotted Dalmatian in the middle of the road in the pouring rain. She has the dog treated by a vet, learns that she has recently given birth, and names her Perdita (meaning \"lost\"). Perdita helps to nurse the pups and becomes a member of the family, later telling Pongo about her lost love Prince and the resulting litter of puppies which were sold by her owner, and that she had run away looking for those puppies.\n\nOne day, while walking Pongo and Missis, Mr. and Mrs. Dearly have a chance meeting with an old schoolmate of Mrs. Dearly: Cruella de Vil, a very wealthy woman so fixated on fur clothing that she married a furrier and forces him to keep his fur collection in their home so she can wear the pieces whenever she likes. She admires the two dogs and expresses a desire to have a Dalmatian-skin coat. She happens to be in the house when the puppies start to arrive, and offers to buy them all. They refuse, and shortly after that the puppies disappear. The humans fail to trace them but through the \"Twilight Barking\", a forum of communication in which dogs can relay messages to each other across the country, the dogs track them down to \"Hell Hall\", the ancestral home of the de Vil family in [[Suffolk]]. Pongo and Missis try to tell the Dearlys where the puppies are but fail: Pongo tried to say the human word \"Suffolk\" but could not make the \"s\" sound. The dogs decide to find the puppies themselves, leaving Perdita to look after the Dearlys. After an eventful journey across the English countryside, with food and accommodation along the way arranged by dogs through the Barking Network, they meet the Colonel, an [[Old English Sheepdog]] at [[Withermarsh]] in Suffolk; he shows them Hell Hall and tells them its history. They get inside the mansion and discover that there are 97 puppies in Hell Hall, including Pongo and Missis' own 15.\n\nCruella de Vil arrives and tells the two crooks in charge of Hell Hall that they must slaughter and skin the dogs as soon as possible because of the publicity surrounding the theft of the Dearlys' puppies. Pongo and Missis realize they must rescue all of the puppies immediately and they escape the night before Christmas Eve. One puppy, Cadpig, is a [[runt]] and too weak to walk the long distance from Suffolk to London so Tommy, the Colonel's two-year-old owner, lends her a toy farm cart; one of the litters of puppies is just the right age for two of its members to fit its shaft, so they pull it in shifts. When Cruella returns to find the puppies gone, she begins to pursue them. However, the Dalmatians have encountered one of the Barking Network dogs, who points out how conspicuous they are and helps them break into a chimney sweep's establishment where they roll in [[soot]] to disguise themselves. Cruella nearly catches up with them, but they are able to hide in an empty removal van at the invitation of a [[Staffordshire Bull Terrier|Staffordshire terrier]] whose \"pets\" own the van\u2014which is returning to London that very night.\n\nUpon arriving in London, the dogs destroy the de Vils' collection of animal skins and fur coats with the help of Cruella's cat, who was angry and distressed at losing many litters of kittens which Cruella had drowned. The Dalmatians then return to the Dearlys' house, where Pongo and Missis bark until Mr. Dearly opens the door, whereupon the whole mass of puppies go streaming in without stopping. Once the dogs roll on the carpet to remove the soot from their coats, the Dearlys recognise them and send out for steaks to feed them. The litter that pulled Cadpig's cart proved to be Perdita's litter by Prince. Mr. Dearly finds out where the puppies had been when he discovers a label on the toy cart which contains Tommy's name and address. The Dearlys also place advertisements seeking the owners of the other puppies, but it turns out that they had all been sold, rather than stolen as the Dearlys' were.\n\nCruella's now-homeless cat drops by (and is invited to stay) with the news that the destruction of her husband's fur business has forced Cruella to put Hell Hall up for sale. When the Dearlys visit Suffolk to return Tommy's cart, they realize that, with 97 puppies, and three adult Dalmatians, a larger home would be a good idea, so Mr Dearly buys the hall with money he has been given by the government for sorting out another tax problem. He proposes to use it to start a \"dynasty of Dalmatians\" (and a \"dynasty of Dearlys\" to take care of them). Finally, Perdita's lost love, Prince, turns up. His owners see his love for Perdita and allow him to stay with the Dearlys and become their \"one hundred and oneth\" Dalmatian.\n\n==Adaptations==\n\n{{Main|One Hundred and One Dalmatians (franchise)}}\n[[The Walt Disney Company|Disney]] adapted the novel into an [[animated film]], released to cinemas on 25 January 1961 as ''[[One Hundred and One Dalmatians]]''.

The Dearly dogs are now among 97 puppies who were kidnapped or legally purchased from various owners, with the intention of skinning them for their [[fur]]. Through the co-operation of animals and the \"Twilight barking\", the dogs are found in [[Suffolk]], England, and a rescue ensues.\n\n==Plot==\nPongo and Missis are a pair of [[Dalmatian (dog)|Dalmatian]]s who live with the newly married Mr. and Mrs. Dearly and their two nannies, Nanny Cook and Nanny Butler. Mr. Dearly is a \"financial wizard\" who has been granted lifelong tax exemption and lent a house on the Outer Circle in [[Regent's Park]] in return for wiping out the [[government debt]]. The dogs consider the humans their pets, but allow the humans to think that they are the owners.\n\nMissis gives birth to a litter of 15 puppies. Concerned that Missis will not be able to feed them all, the humans join in to help. As Mrs. Dearly looks for a canine [[wet nurse]], she finds an exhausted liver-spotted Dalmatian in the middle of the road in the pouring rain. She has the dog treated by a vet, learns that she has recently given birth, and names her Perdita (meaning \"lost\"). Perdita helps to nurse the pups and becomes a member of the family, later telling Pongo about her lost love Prince and the resulting litter of puppies which were sold by her owner, and that she had run away looking for those puppies.\n\nOne day, while walking Pongo and Missis, Mr. and Mrs. Dearly have a chance meeting with an old schoolmate of Mrs. Dearly: Cruella de Vil, a very wealthy woman so fixated on fur clothing that she married a furrier and forces him to keep his fur collection in their home so she can wear the pieces whenever she likes.
