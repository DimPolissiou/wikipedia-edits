Pleasence had also appeared in the BBC television version, playing the character of Syme, which for the film was amalgamated with that of the character Parsons.\n\nLike the [[Animal Farm (1954 film)|earlier film adaption]] of ''[[Animal Farm]]'', ''1984'' was secretly funded by the [[Central Intelligence Agency]].<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Morris|first1=Nigel|title=Keeping It All in the (Nuclear) Family: Big Brother, Auntie BBC, Uncle Sam and George Orwell\u2019s Nineteen Eighty-Four|journal=Frames Cinema Journal|url=http://framescinemajournal.com/article/keeping-it-all-in-the-nuclear-family-big-brother-auntie-bbc-uncle-sam-and-george-orwells-nineteen-eighty-four/}}</ref>\n\n==Plot==\nA voice-over narrator explains that in the mid-1950s, a [[nuclear war]] and devastation of Earth gave rise to [[Nations of Nineteen Eighty-Four|three superstates]]: Oceania, Eurasia, and East Asia. By 1984, London, with its bomb-proof ministry, is designated as the capital of Airstrip One, a province of Oceania, controlled by one all-powerful Party, embodied by the figurehead [[Big Brother (1984)|Big Brother]].\n\nIn the spring of 1984, [[Winston Smith]], a member of the elite Outer Party, encounters [[Julia (1984)|Julia]], a woman he suspects may be a member of the [[Thought Police]]. Winston returns to his apartment, where an electronic surveillance eye examines the contents of his briefcase. Smuggling a small black diary past the eye, Winston begins to write down the subversive thoughts he fears to say aloud. Winston's reverie is interrupted when Selina Parsons, a little girl who lives next door, enters his apartment to practice denouncing him as a traitor. Robert Parsons, Selina's father, invites Winston to join him at the local Chestnut Tree caf\u00e9.\n\nAt the cafe, Winston and Parsons spot Rutherford and Jones, two Outer Party traitors who have been rehabilitated by the government's Ministry of Love. Afterwards, Winston goes to a junk shop to wonder at the objects of yesteryear that are now deemed worthless. Julia enters the shop, sending Winston scurrying into the street, where he is stopped by the police and ordered to report to Administration the next morning.\n\nAt the Administration the next day, a party officer reprimands Winston for socializing with the common masses. Winston then proceeds to his job at the Records Department at the Ministry of Truth. When Winston discovers a photo that would prove Jones and Rutherford innocent, [[O'Brien (1984)|O'Connor]], Winston's superior, instructs him to destroy it.\n\nThat evening, at a political rally, Julia passes Winston a note professing her love to him. Later, they arrange to meet Sunday in a meadow outside London, far from the prying microphones and monitors of Big Brother. There, they touch each other, an act prohibited by the Anti-Sex League, and proceed to make love.\n\nTwo weeks later, Winston proposes renting a room at the junk store, one of the few places free of the omnipresent monitors.

The character [[O'Brien (1984)|O'Brien]], the antagonist, was renamed \"O'Connor\", due to the shared surname of the actor Edmond O'Brien.

Pleasence had also appeared in the BBC television version, playing the character of Syme, which for the film was amalgamated with that of the character Parsons.\n\nLike the [[Animal Farm (1954 film)|earlier film adaption]] of ''[[Animal Farm]]'', ''1984'' was secretly funded by the [[Central Intelligence Agency]].<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Morris|first1=Nigel|title=Keeping It All in the (Nuclear) Family: Big Brother, Auntie BBC, Uncle Sam and George Orwell\u2019s Nineteen Eighty-Four|journal=Frames Cinema Journal|url=http://framescinemajournal.com/article/keeping-it-all-in-the-nuclear-family-big-brother-auntie-bbc-uncle-sam-and-george-orwells-nineteen-eighty-four/}}</ref>\n\n==Plot==\nA voice-over narrator explains that in the mid-1950s, a [[nuclear war]] and devastation of Earth gave rise to [[Nations of Nineteen Eighty-Four|three superstates]]: Oceania, Eurasia, and East Asia. By 1984, London, with its bomb-proof ministry, is designated as the capital of Airstrip One, a province of Oceania, controlled by one all-powerful Party, embodied by the figurehead [[Big Brother (1984)|Big Brother]].\n\nIn the spring of 1984, [[Winston Smith]], a member of the elite Outer Party, encounters [[Julia (1984)|Julia]], a woman he suspects may be a member of the [[Thought Police]]. Winston returns to his apartment, where an electronic surveillance eye examines the contents of his briefcase. Smuggling a small black diary past the eye, Winston begins to write down the subversive thoughts he fears to say aloud. Winston's reverie is interrupted when Selina Parsons, a little girl who lives next door, enters his apartment to practice denouncing him as a traitor. Robert Parsons, Selina's father, invites Winston to join him at the local Chestnut Tree caf\u00e9.\n\nAt the cafe, Winston and Parsons spot Rutherford and Jones, two Outer Party traitors who have been rehabilitated by the government's Ministry of Love. Afterwards, Winston goes to a junk shop to wonder at the objects of yesteryear that are now deemed worthless. Julia enters the shop, sending Winston scurrying into the street, where he is stopped by the police and ordered to report to Administration the next morning.\n\nAt the Administration the next day, a party officer reprimands Winston for socializing with the common masses. Winston then proceeds to his job at the Records Department at the Ministry of Truth. When Winston discovers a photo that would prove Jones and Rutherford innocent, [[O'Brien (1984)|O'Connor]], Winston's superior, instructs him to destroy it.\n\nThat evening, at a political rally, Julia passes Winston a note professing her love to him. Later, they arrange to meet Sunday in a meadow outside London, far from the prying microphones and monitors of Big Brother. There, they touch each other, an act prohibited by the Anti-Sex League, and proceed to make love.\n\nTwo weeks later, Winston proposes renting a room at the junk store, one of the few places free of the omnipresent monitors. In the sanctity of their quarters, Winston confides that he believes O'Connor may be a member of the Underground.\n\nOne night, Winston finds a note written in O'Connor's handwriting that reads \"down with Big Brother.\" Convinced that O'Connor represents their only hope to break free of the tyranny of Big Brother, Julia and Winston go to his apartment and declare that they want to join the Underground. O'Connor instructs Winston to carry an empty briefcase with him at all times.\n\nA few days later, during a rally to launch Hate Week, a man switches briefcases with Winston. When Winston opens the case, he finds a copy of a treatise by the alleged leader of the Underground. Back in their secret room, Julia muses that only love can defeat Big Brother. At that moment, a telescreen hidden behind a mirror condemns Julia's sentiments, after which, the police burst in to arrest them.\n\nAt the Ministry of Love, Winston is confined in a pit-like room. Soon after, Parsons is thrown into the pit, his daughter having denounced him for muttering in his sleep \"Down with Big Brother.\" After Parsons is taken away, O'Connor enters the room and reveals himself to be a covert agent of the state.

Some are told in the traditional manner; with a beginning, middle and end; others are short staccato bursts of poetic energy, gorgeous in their use of language and satisfying as a good story should be... None is disappointing. Each story is a good read, and the variety of construction adds to the interest and encourages further exploration ... For your average Kiwi, it adds an exotic touch and extra interest ... Some stories make you wonder where they come from, how they arrived in the author\u2019s imagination, but they \u2018re so good you\u2019d be pleased they did. Paul Brooks - Midweek\n\n\u201cMoisa doesn\u2019t disappoint. His stories are wide-ranging, both in subject matter and character portrayal, and his wit and his perception of human frailty reflect a life lived in several manifestations. This collection covers stories from New Zealand scenes as well as echoing the six years spent as a child in Cyprus in the late 1950s and as a young man in 1973 and 1974. ... Several of Moisa\u2019s stories have the surprise ending which is imperative for a good story, and this is one of the strengths and delights of his book ... Blood and Koka Kola ... is a very interesting, insightful and appealing collection of short stories...\u201d Michael O'Leary- Landfall\n\n==Novel==\n* The Hour of the Grey Wolf, Christodoulos Moisa 2016, {{ISBN|978-1519445988}} \nCRITICS COMMENTS:\"The writing style can best be described as erudite with allusions to historical and Biblical events. In a less fluent writer, these descriptions would slow the story down but this is not the case ...

I recommend it.\" <ref>Doug Davidson RIVER CITY PRESS 14 July 2016.</ref>\nThe Hour of the Grey Wolf is a crime story ... in many ways, it defies the genre. It is literary fiction as well, experimental in form, so experimental that, simply linked together with logic, the parts should not work together to form that coherent whole. And yet they do. ... a compelling page-turner, a classic whodunit. ... I kept turning the pages and am certain other readers will too.

The cleverly devised plot will keep you intrigued right through to the end ... For those of us familiar with Wellington during the 1950s\u2019 \u201cOvercast Sunday\u201d will evoke a few memories of a time and lifestyle that no longer exists. The title itself belongs to a song, a type of blues music in keeping with the sentiments of love, joy and sorrow and particularly poignant for immigrants far from their homeland. The book gives examples of the hardships, hopes and dashed dreams which marked their lives and the reasons for moving to New Zealand. Like all immigrants they found it to be no promised land and this informs and colours the book as various incidents are woven into the plot ...\" Marion Davidson RIVER CITY PRESS 17 November 2016.\n\n\"This is not your average crime novel, in fact, although the story features a crime- a murder \u2013 it is a story of a place, a time, and the characters who converge on both.

Chris Moisa has written a fine story, crafted in such a way that may irritate and impatient reader, but rich in knowledge and understanding of the community in which the book is centered, and the forces that bring everything together at that point.\nThe reader learns a lot and becomes intimately engaged with each character, their lives laid bare for us in the book\u2019s unusual configuration. \nThe author captured the time, the economics, politics and social ambiance of New Zealand in 1950, with the Greek community the focus of his attention.\nThe story is not for me to tell but I really enjoyed it. The book is not laid out in a traditional format, and what I see it has challenged the odd critic. I found it enhanced the yarn Chris tells.

Some are told in the traditional manner; with a beginning, middle and end; others are short staccato bursts of poetic energy, gorgeous in their use of language and satisfying as a good story should be... None is disappointing. Each story is a good read, and the variety of construction adds to the interest and encourages further exploration ... For your average Kiwi, it adds an exotic touch and extra interest ...

Several of Moisa\u2019s stories have the surprise ending which is imperative for a good story, and this is one of the strengths and delights of his book ...
