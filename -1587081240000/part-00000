One problem is that Mr. Rogen, however comically inclined, has become overexposed, and there\u2019s just something too familiar and predictable about this voice coming out of that body. Yet while Paul seems great conceptually, he\u2019s not particularly interesting or surprising, despite a funny recap of what he\u2019s been doing on his time on Earth. With his vibe and vocabulary, shorts and weed, [[juvenilia]] and sentimentality, Paul turns out to be not much different from a lot of guys who have wreaked comedy havoc on American screens lately, even if this one only wants to beam up, not knock up.\"<ref>{{cite news| title=Calm Down, People; He Comes in Peace | date= March 17, 2011 | first=Manohla |last= Dargis| authorlink= Manohla Dargis| url= https://movies.nytimes.com/2011/03/18/movies/paul-he-comes-in-peace-review.html |newspaper=The New York Times| accessdate=2011-09-17}}</ref>\n\n===Box office===\nThe film has grossed $97,984,015 worldwide.

Starring Pegg, Frost and the voice and [[motion capture]] of [[Seth Rogen]], the film plot focuses on two science fiction geeks who meet an [[Extraterrestrial life|alien]] with a sarcastic manner and an appetite for alcohol and cigarettes. Together, they help the alien escape from the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] agents who are pursuing him so that he can return to his home world. The film is a [[parody]] of other science-fiction films, especially those of [[Steven Spielberg]], as well as to general [[science fiction fandom]].\n\nIt is a British-American venture produced by [[Working Title Films]], [[StudioCanal]], [[Big Talk Productions#Big Talk Pictures|Big Talk Pictures]] and [[Relativity Media]], and distributed by [[Universal Pictures]]. ''Paul'' was released on 14 February 2011 in the United Kingdom and on 18 March 2011 in the United States to moderate positive reactions from critics, and grossed $98 million worldwide<ref name=boxofficemojo/> on a $40 million budget.<ref name=\"nyt2011greg\"/><ref name=LABox/>\n\n==Plot==\nGraeme Willy and Clive Gollings are British [[comic book]] enthusiasts and best friends who travel to the United States to attend the annual [[San Diego Comic-Con]], and to take a road trip through the [[Southwestern United States]] to visit sites significant to [[Unidentified flying object|UFO]] lore. While driving on a remote desert highway at night, after a tense situation with some rednecks in a diner, Graeme and Clive observe a car driving erratically and then crashing. They stop to investigate and offer assistance to the driver, who turns out to be an [[Extraterrestrial life|alien]] named Paul, whom Graeme agrees to give a ride despite Clive fainting and wetting his own pants from seeing him. Later, Special Agent Zoil of the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] arrives at the car-crash site and informs his unseen female superior, \"the Big Guy\", that he is closing in on Paul. She sends two inept rookies, Haggard and O'Reilly, to assist Zoil.\n\nClive remains paranoid over Paul's intentions, considering his appearance evidence of a [[conspiracy theory]], until Paul tells them that the government spoon fed his image to the public to keep them from panicking if anyone encounters his race. They later camp at an [[RV park]] run by two [[Christian fundamentalism|Christian fundamentalists]], one-eyed Ruth Buggs and her father Moses. The next day, when Ruth discovers Paul, she faints, and the three have no choice but to take her with them. During an argument, Paul convinces Ruth to question her beliefs and uses his healing power to cure Ruth's blinded eye. The fugitives stop at a bar and Ruth tries to call her father, but Zoil intercepts the call. She is then accosted by the rednecks from the diner and a bar fight ensues. The group escapes when Paul terrifies the rednecks into fainting. Later, at another RV park, Ruth is questioned by Agent Zoil, but feigns ignorance and escapes. Haggard and O'Reilly in the meantime have figured out about Paul. When they confront Zoil, he orders them to return to base but they go behind his back and insist on catching the alien on their own.\n\nThe group soon arrives at the house of a woman named Tara, who rescued Paul when he crashed on Earth 60 years ago and accidentally killed her dog (after whom Paul was named) in the crash (seen at the beginning of the movie). As a result of no one believing her story, she has spent her life as a pariah. Although angry at first, she forgives Paul and goes to make coffee for her visitors. Just then, Haggard, O'Reilly and Zoil surround the house. The fugitives flee, but O'Reilly shoots at them, igniting gas from Tara's stove and destroying her house with O'Reilly inside it. Haggard pursues and catches up to the RV but loses control and drives off a cliff and is killed. Zoil reassures the Big Guy that he will have Paul within the hour, but she is tired of waiting and informs Zoil that she has ordered a \"military response\".\n\nPaul, Graeme, Clive, Ruth and Tara arrive at [[Devils Tower|Devils Tower National Monument]], where they set off fireworks as a signal to Paul's mothership. A helicopter suddenly arrives with agents and the Big Guy. Zoil then appears and initiates a stand-off, unexpectedly shooting the Big Guy's agents, before being wounded by the Big Guy. It is revealed that Zoil is Paul's friend and was attempting to aid his escape under the guise of capturing him. During the fight, Tara knocks out the Big Guy. Moses arrives unexpectedly and fires at Paul, but hits Graeme instead. Paul once again uses his healing powers, reviving Graeme in spite of the danger to himself, causing Moses to believe Paul to be a [[messiah]]. Graeme and Ruth admit their feelings for each other and kiss, but then the Big Guy regains consciousness and holds the group at gunpoint. Just as the Big Guy is about to kill them, she is crushed by the landing mothership. Paul says goodbye to his friends and offers Tara a chance to go with him, promising to give her a new life after ruining her childhood and accidentally killing her dog. The aliens go home as the humans wave them goodbye.\n\nTwo years later, Graeme, Clive, Ruth, Zoil and O'Reilly (who survived the explosion) are at another Comic-Con, where Graeme and Clive are promoting their new bestselling novel titled ''Paul''.\n\n==Cast==\n[[File:Seth Rogen by Gage Skidmore 2.jpg|right|thumb|185px|[[Seth Rogen]] provides the voice and [[motion capture]] for Paul the alien.]]\n* [[Simon Pegg]] as Graeme Willy\n* [[Nick Frost]] as Clive Gollings\n* [[Seth Rogen]] as Paul (voice and [[motion capture]])<ref name=\"paul\">{{cite news| date= 2009-05-26| first= Michael\n| last= Fleming| title= Seth Rogen to voice 'Paul' for Pegg| url= https://www.variety.com/article/VR1118004183.html| work= [[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]| accessdate= 2009-06-18}}</ref>\n* [[Jason Bateman]] as Special Agent Lorenzo Zoil.

With his vibe and vocabulary, shorts and weed, [[juvenilia]] and sentimentality, Paul turns out to be not much different from a lot of guys who have wreaked comedy havoc on American screens lately, even if this one only wants to beam up, not knock up.\"<ref>{{cite news| title=Calm Down, People; He Comes in Peace | date= March 17, 2011 | first=Manohla |last= Dargis| authorlink= Manohla Dargis| url= https://movies.nytimes.com/2011/03/18/movies/paul-he-comes-in-peace-review.html |newspaper=The New York Times| accessdate=2011-09-17}}</ref>\n\n===Box office===\nThe film has grossed $97,984,015 worldwide.
