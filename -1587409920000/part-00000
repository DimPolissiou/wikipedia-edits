{"title_page": "2-satisfiability", "text_new": "{{good article}}\nIn [[computer science]], '''2-satisfiability''', '''2-SAT''' or just '''2SAT''' is a [[computational problem]] of assigning values to variables, each of which has two possible values, in order to satisfy a system of [[Constraint (mathematics)|constraints]] on pairs of variables. It is a special case of the general [[Boolean satisfiability problem]], which can involve constraints on more than two variables, and of [[constraint satisfaction problem]]s, which can allow more than two choices for the value of each variable. But in contrast to those more general problems, which are [[NP-complete]], 2-satisfiability can be solved in [[polynomial time]].\n\nInstances of the 2-satisfiability problem are typically expressed as [[Boolean logic|Boolean formula]]s of a special type, called [[conjunctive normal form]] (2-CNF) or '''Krom formulas'''. Alternatively, they may be expressed as a special type of [[directed graph]], the [[implication graph]], which expresses the variables of an instance and their negations as vertices in a graph, and constraints on pairs of variables as directed edges. Both of these kinds of inputs may be solved in [[linear time]], either by a method based on [[backtracking]] or by using the [[strongly connected components]] of the implication graph.\n[[Resolution (logic)|Resolution]], a method for combining pairs of constraints to make additional valid constraints, also leads to a polynomial time solution. The 2-satisfiability problems provide one of two major subclasses of the conjunctive normal form formulas that can be solved in polynomial time; the other of the two subclasses is [[Horn-satisfiability]].\n\n2-satisfiability may be applied to geometry and visualization problems in which a collection of objects each have two potential locations and the goal is to find a placement for each object that avoids overlaps with other objects. Other applications include clustering data to minimize the sum of the diameters of the clusters, classroom and sports scheduling, and recovering shapes from information about their cross-sections.\n\nIn [[computational complexity theory]], 2-satisfiability provides an example of an [[NL-complete]] problem, one that can be solved non-deterministically using a logarithmic amount of storage and that is among the hardest of the problems solvable in this resource bound. The set of all solutions to a 2-satisfiability instance can be given the structure of a [[median graph]], but counting these solutions is [[Sharp-P-complete|#P-complete]] and therefore not expected to have a polynomial-time solution. Random instances undergo a sharp phase transition from solvable to unsolvable instances as the ratio of constraints to variables increases past 1, a phenomenon conjectured but unproven for more complicated forms of the satisfiability problem. A computationally difficult variation of 2-satisfiability, finding a truth assignment that maximizes the number of satisfied constraints, has an [[approximation algorithm]] whose optimality depends on the [[unique games conjecture]], and another difficult variation, finding a satisfying assignment minimizing the number of true variables, is an important test case for [[parameterized complexity]].\n\n==Problem representations==\n[[File:Implication graph.svg|thumb|300px|The implication graph for the example 2-satisfiability instance shown in this section.]]\nA 2-satisfiability problem may be described using a [[Boolean expression]] with a special restricted form. It is a [[Logical conjunction|conjunction]] (a Boolean ''and'' operation) of [[Clause (logic)|clauses]], where each clause is a [[disjunction]] (a Boolean ''or'' operation) of two variables or negated variables. The variables or their negations appearing in this formula are known as [[Literal (mathematical logic)|literals]].<ref name=\"cnf\">{{citation|chapter=2.

Such an assignment chooses whether to make each of the variables true or false, so that at least one literal in every clause becomes true. For the expression shown above, one possible satisfying assignment is the one that sets all seven of the variables to true. Every clause has at least one non-negated variable, so this assignment satisfies every clause. There are also 15 other ways of setting all the variables so that the formula becomes true. Therefore, the 2-satisfiability instance represented by this expression is satisfiable.\n\nFormulas in this form are known as 2-CNF formulas. The \"2\" in this name stands for the number of literals per clause, and \"CNF\" stands for [[conjunctive normal form]], a type of Boolean expression in the form of a conjunction of disjunctions.<ref name=\"cnf\"/> They are also called Krom formulas, after the work of [[University of California, Davis|UC Davis]] mathematician Melven R. Krom, whose 1967 paper was one of the earliest works on the 2-satisfiability problem.<ref name=\"Krom1967\">{{citation\n| last1 = Krom | first1 = Melven R.\n| title = The Decision Problem for a Class of First-Order Formulas in Which all Disjunctions are Binary\n| journal = Zeitschrift f\u00fcr Mathematische Logik und Grundlagen der Mathematik\n| volume = 13\n| issue = 1\u20132\n| pages = 15\u201320\n| year = 1967\n| doi = 10.1002/malq.19670130104\n}}.</ref>\n\nEach clause in a 2-CNF formula is [[logical equivalence|logically equivalent]] to an implication from one variable or negated variable to the other. For example, the second clause in the example may be written in any of three equivalent ways:\n:<math>(x_0\\lor\\lnot x_3) \\;\\equiv\\; (\\lnot x_0\\Rightarrow\\lnot x_3) \\;\\equiv\\; (x_3\\Rightarrow x_0).</math>\nBecause of this equivalence between these different types of operation, a 2-satisfiability instance may also be written in [[implicative normal form]], in which we replace each ''or'' clause in the conjunctive normal form by the two implications to which it is equivalent.<ref>{{citation|title=Artificial Intelligence: A Modern Approach|page=282|series=Prentice Hall series in artificial intelligence|first1=Stuart Jonathan|last1=Russell|first2=Peter|last2=Norvig|publisher=Prentice Hall|year=2010|isbn=978-0-13-604259-4}}.</ref>\n\nA third, more graphical way of describing a 2-satisfiability instance is as an [[implication graph]]. An implication graph is a [[directed graph]] in which there is one [[vertex (graph theory)|vertex]] per variable or negated variable, and an edge connecting one vertex to another whenever the corresponding variables are related by an implication in the implicative normal form of the instance. An implication graph must be a [[skew-symmetric graph]], meaning that it has a [[graph automorphism|symmetry]] that takes each variable to its negation and reverses the orientations of all of the edges.<ref name=\"APT79\">{{citation\n | last1 = Aspvall | first1 = Bengt\n | last2 = Plass | first2 = Michael F.\n | authorlink3 = Robert Tarjan | last3 = Tarjan | first3 = Robert E.\n | title = A linear-time algorithm for testing the truth of certain quantified boolean formulas\n | url = http://www.math.ucsd.edu/~sbuss/CourseWeb/Math268_2007WS/2SAT.pdf\n | journal = [[Information Processing Letters]]\n | volume = 8 | issue = 3 | pages = 121\u2013123 | year = 1979\n | doi = 10.1016/0020-0190(79)90002-4}}.</ref>\n\n==Algorithms==\nSeveral algorithms are known for solving the 2-satisfiability problem. The most efficient of them take [[linear time]].<ref name=\"Krom1967\"/><ref name=\"APT79\"/><ref name=\"EIS76\"/>\n\n===Resolution and transitive closure===\n{{harvtxt|Krom|1967}} described the following [[polynomial time]] decision procedure for solving 2-satisfiability instances.<ref name=\"Krom1967\"/>\n\nSuppose that a 2-satisfiability instance contains two clauses that both use the same variable ''x'', but that ''x'' is negated in one clause and not in the other. Then the two clauses may be combined to produce a third clause, having the two other literals in the two clauses; this third clause must also be satisfied whenever the first two clauses are both satisfied. For instance, we may combine the clauses <math>(a\\lor b)</math> and <math>(\\lnot b\\lor\\lnot c)</math> in this way to produce the clause <math>(a\\lor\\lnot c)</math>. In terms of the implicative form of a 2-CNF formula, this rule amounts to finding two implications <math>\\lnot a\\Rightarrow b</math> and <math>b\\Rightarrow \\lnot c</math>, and inferring by [[transitive relation|transitivity]] a third implication <math>\\lnot a\\Rightarrow \\lnot c</math>.<ref name=\"Krom1967\"/>\n\nKrom writes that a formula is ''consistent'' if repeated application of this inference rule cannot generate both the clauses <math>(x\\lor x)</math> and <math> (\\lnot x\\lor\\lnot x)</math>, for any variable <math> x</math>. As he proves, a 2-CNF formula is satisfiable if and only if it is consistent. For, if a formula is not consistent, it is not possible to satisfy both of the two clauses <math> (x\\lor x)</math> and <math>(\\lnot x\\lor\\lnot x)</math> simultaneously. And, if it is consistent, then the formula can be extended by repeatedly adding one clause of the form <math> (x\\lor x)</math> or <math> (\\lnot x\\lor\\lnot x)</math> at a time, preserving consistency at each step, until it includes such a clause for every variable. At each of these extension steps, one of these two clauses may always be added while preserving consistency, for if not then the other clause could be generated using the inference rule. Once all variables have a clause of this form in the formula, a satisfying assignment of all of the variables may be generated by setting a variable <math> x</math> to true if the formula contains the clause <math> (x\\lor x)</math> and setting it to false if the formula contains the clause <math>(\\lnot x\\lor\\lnot x)</math>.<ref name=\"Krom1967\"/>\n\nKrom was concerned primarily with [[completeness (logic)|completeness]] of systems of inference rules, rather than with the efficiency of algorithms. However, his method leads to a [[polynomial time]] bound for solving 2-satisfiability problems.\nBy grouping together all of the clauses that use the same variable, and applying the inference rule to each pair of clauses, it is possible to find all inferences that are possible from a given 2-CNF instance, and to test whether it is consistent, in total time {{math|O(''n''<sup>3</sup>)}}, where {{math|''n''}} is the number of variables in the instance. This formula comes from multiplying the number of variables by the {{math|O(''n''<sup>2</sup>)}} number of pairs of clauses involving a given variable, to which the inference rule may be applied. Thus, it is possible to determine whether a given 2-CNF instance is satisfiable in time {{math|O(''n''<sup>3</sup>)}}. Because finding a satisfying assignment using Krom's method involves a sequence of {{math|O(''n'')}} consistency checks, it would take time {{math|O(''n''<sup>4</sup>)}}. {{harvtxt|Even|Itai|Shamir|1976}} quote a faster time bound of {{math|O(''n''<sup>2</sup>)}} for this algorithm, based on more careful ordering of its operations. Nevertheless, even this smaller time bound was greatly improved by the later linear time algorithms of {{harvtxt|Even|Itai|Shamir|1976}} and {{harvtxt|Aspvall|Plass|Tarjan|1979}}.\n\nIn terms of the implication graph of the 2-satisfiability instance, Krom's inference rule can be interpreted as constructing the [[transitive closure]] of the graph. As {{harvtxt|Cook|1971}} observes, it can also be seen as an instance of the [[Davis\u2013Putnam algorithm]] for solving satisfiability problems using the principle of [[Resolution (logic)|resolution]]. Its correctness follows from the more general correctness of the Davis\u2013Putnam algorithm. Its polynomial time bound follows from the fact that each resolution step increases the number of clauses in the instance, which is upper bounded by a quadratic function of the number of variables.<ref>{{citation|first=Stephen A.|last=Cook|authorlink=Stephen Cook|contribution=The complexity of theorem-proving procedures|title=Proc. 3rd ACM Symp.

Certain steps of the algorithms are \"choice points\", points at which a variable can be given either of two different truth values, and later steps in the algorithm may cause it to backtrack to one of these choice points. However, only the most recent choice can be backtracked over. All choices made earlier than the most recent one are permanent.<ref name=\"EIS76\"/>\n\nInitially, there is no choice point, and all variables are unassigned.\nAt each step, the algorithm chooses the variable whose value to set, as follows:\n*If there is a clause both of whose variables are already set, in a way that falsifies the clause, then the algorithm backtracks to its most recent choice point, undoing the assignments it made since that choice, and reverses the decision made at that choice. If there is no choice point, or if the algorithm has already backtracked over the most recent choice point, then it aborts the search and reports that the input 2-CNF formula is unsatisfiable.\n*If there is a clause in which one of the clause's two variables has already been set, and the clause could still become either true or false, then the other variable is set in a way that forces the clause to become true.\n*In the remaining case, each clause is either guaranteed to become true no matter how the remaining variables are assigned, or neither of its two variables has been assigned yet. In this case the algorithm creates a new choice point and sets any one of the unassigned variables to an arbitrarily chosen value.\n\nIntuitively, the algorithm follows all chains of inference after making each of its choices. This either leads to a contradiction and a backtracking step, or, if no contradiction is derived, it follows that the choice was a correct one that leads to a satisfying assignment. Therefore, the algorithm either correctly finds a satisfying assignment or it correctly determines that the input is unsatisfiable.<ref name=\"EIS76\"/>\n\nEven et al. did not describe in detail how to implement this algorithm efficiently. They state only that by \"using appropriate data structures in order to find the implications of any decision\", each step of the algorithm (other than the backtracking) can be performed quickly. However, some inputs may cause the algorithm to backtrack many times, each time performing many steps before backtracking, so its overall complexity may be nonlinear. To avoid this problem, they modify the algorithm so that, after reaching each choice point, it begins simultaneously testing both of the two assignments for the variable set at the choice point, spending equal numbers of steps on each of the two assignments. As soon as the test for one of these two assignments would create another choice point, the other test is stopped, so that at any stage of the algorithm there are only two branches of the backtracking tree that are still being tested. In this way, the total time spent performing the two tests for any variable is proportional to the number of variables and clauses of the input formula whose values are permanently assigned. As a result, the algorithm takes [[linear time]] in total.<ref name=\"EIS76\"/>\n\n===Strongly connected components===\n{{harvtxt|Aspvall|Plass|Tarjan|1979}} found a simpler linear time procedure for solving 2-satisfiability instances, based on the notion of [[strongly connected component]]s from [[graph theory]].<ref name=\"APT79\"/>\n\nTwo vertices in a directed graph are said to be strongly connected to each other if there is a directed path from one to the other and vice versa. This is an [[equivalence relation]], and the vertices of the graph may be partitioned into strongly connected components, subsets within which every two vertices are strongly connected. There are several efficient linear time algorithms for finding the strongly connected components of a graph, based on [[depth first search]]: [[Tarjan's strongly connected components algorithm]]<ref>{{citation|first=Robert E.|last=Tarjan|authorlink=Robert Tarjan|title=Depth-first search and linear graph algorithms|journal=[[SIAM Journal on Computing]]|volume=1|year=1972|issue=2|pages=146\u2013160|doi=10.1137/0201010}}.</ref> and the [[path-based strong component algorithm]]<ref>First published by {{citation\n | last1 = Cheriyan | first1 = J.\n | last2 = Mehlhorn | first2 = K. | author2-link = Kurt Mehlhorn\n | doi = 10.1007/BF01940880\n | journal = [[Algorithmica]]\n | pages = 521\u2013549\n | title = Algorithms for dense graphs and networks on the random access computer\n | volume = 15\n | year = 1996\n | issue = 6}}.

[[Kosaraju's algorithm]] performs two depth first searches, but is very simple.\n\nIn terms of the implication graph, two literals belong to the same strongly connected component whenever there exist chains of implications from one literal to the other and vice versa. Therefore, the two literals must have the same value in any satisfying assignment to the given 2-satisfiability instance. In particular, if a variable and its negation both belong to the same strongly connected component, the instance cannot be satisfied, because it is impossible to assign both of these literals the same value. As Aspvall et al. showed, this is a [[necessary and sufficient condition]]: a 2-CNF formula is satisfiable if and only if there is no variable that belongs to the same strongly connected component as its negation.<ref name=\"APT79\"/>\n\nThis immediately leads to a linear time algorithm for testing satisfiability of 2-CNF formulae: simply perform a strong connectivity analysis on the implication graph and check that each variable and its negation belong to different components. However, as Aspvall et al. also showed, it also leads to a linear time algorithm for finding a satisfying assignment, when one exists. Their algorithm performs the following steps:\n*Construct the implication graph of the instance, and find its strongly connected components using any of the known linear-time algorithms for strong connectivity analysis.\n*Check whether any strongly connected component contains both a variable and its negation. If so, report that the instance is not satisfiable and halt.\n*Construct the [[Strongly connected component|condensation]] of the implication graph, a smaller graph that has one vertex for each strongly connected component, and an edge from component {{math|''i''}} to component {{math|''j''}} whenever the implication graph contains an edge {{math|''uv''}} such that {{math|''u''}} belongs to component {{math|''i''}} and {{math|''v''}} belongs to component {{math|''j''}}. The condensation is automatically a [[directed acyclic graph]] and, like the implication graph from which it was formed, it is [[Skew-symmetric graph|skew-symmetric]].\n*[[Topological sorting|Topologically order]] the vertices of the condensation.  In practice this may be efficiently achieved as a side effect of the previous step, as components are generated by Kosaraju's algorithm in topological order and by Tarjan's algorithm in reverse topological order.<ref>{{cite web|last=Harrison|first=Paul|title=Robust topological sorting and Tarjan's algorithm in Python|url=http://www.logarithmic.net/pfh/blog/01208083168|accessdate=9 February 2011}}</ref>\n*For each component in the reverse topological order, if its variables do not already have truth assignments, set all the literals in the component to be true. This also causes all of the literals in the complementary component to be set to false.\n\nDue to the reverse topological ordering and the skew-symmetry, when a literal is set to true, all literals that can be reached from it via a chain of implications will already have been set to true. Symmetrically, when a literal {{math|''x''}} is set to false, all literals that lead to it via a chain of implications will themselves already have been set to false. Therefore, the truth assignment constructed by this procedure satisfies the given formula, which also completes the proof of correctness of the necessary and sufficient condition identified by Aspvall et al.<ref name=\"APT79\"/>\n\nAs Aspvall et al. show, a similar procedure involving topologically ordering the strongly connected components of the implication graph may also be used to evaluate [[True quantified Boolean formula|fully quantified Boolean formulae]] in which the formula being quantified is a 2-CNF formula.<ref name=\"APT79\"/>\n\n==Applications==\n\n===Conflict-free placement of geometric objects===\nA number of exact and approximate algorithms for the [[automatic label placement]] problem are based on 2-satisfiability. This problem concerns placing textual labels on the features of a diagram or map. Typically, the set of possible locations for each label is highly constrained, not only by the map itself (each label must be near the feature it labels, and must not obscure other features), but by each other: every two labels should avoid overlapping each other, for otherwise they would become illegible. In general, finding a label placement that obeys these constraints is an [[NP-hard]] problem. However, if each feature has only two possible locations for its label (say, extending to the left and to the right of the feature) then label placement may be solved in polynomial time. For, in this case, one may create a 2-satisfiability instance that has a variable for each label and that has a clause for each pair of labels that could overlap, preventing them from being assigned overlapping positions. If the labels are all congruent rectangles, the corresponding 2-satisfiability instance can be shown to have only linearly many constraints, leading to near-linear time algorithms for finding a labeling.<ref name=\"fw91\">{{citation|first1=M.|last1=Formann|first2=F.|last2=Wagner|contribution=A packing problem with applications to lettering of maps|title=Proc. 7th ACM Symposium on Computational Geometry|year=1991|pages=281\u2013288|doi=10.1145/109648.109680|isbn=978-0-89791-426-0|title-link=Symposium on Computational Geometry}}.</ref> {{harvtxt|Poon|Zhu|Chin|1998}} describe a map labeling problem in which each label is a rectangle that may be placed in one of three positions with respect to a line segment that it labels: it may have the segment as one of its sides, or it may be centered on the segment.

To find a labeling with a given size, they eliminate squares that, if doubled, would overlap another point, and they eliminate points that can be labeled in a way that cannot possibly overlap with another point's label. They show that these elimination rules cause the remaining points to have only two possible label placements per point, allowing a valid label placement (if one exists) to be found as the solution to a 2-satisfiability instance. By searching for the largest label size that leads to a solvable 2-satisfiability instance, they find a valid label placement whose labels are at least half as large as the optimal solution.

In [[graph drawing]], if the vertex locations are fixed and each edge must be drawn as a circular arc with one of two possible locations (for instance as an [[arc diagram]]), then the problem of choosing which arc to use for each edge in order to avoid crossings is a 2-satisfiability problem with a variable for each edge and a constraint for each pair of placements that would lead to a crossing.

Boros ''et al.'' consider a simplified version of the problem in which the modules have already been placed along a single linear channel, in which the wires between modules must be routed, and there is a fixed bound on the density of the channel (the maximum number of signals that must pass through any cross-section of the channel). They observe that this version of the problem may be solved as a 2-satisfiability instance, in which the constraints relate the orientations of pairs of modules that are directly across the channel from each other.

If the target diameters of the two clusters are known, a clustering that achieves those targets may be found by solving a 2-satisfiability instance. The instance has one variable per point, indicating whether that point belongs to the first cluster or the second cluster. Whenever any two points are too far apart from each other for both to belong to the same cluster, a clause is added to the instance that prevents this assignment.\n\nThe same method also can be used as a subroutine when the individual cluster diameters are unknown. To test whether a given sum of diameters can be achieved without knowing the individual cluster diameters, one may try all maximal pairs of target diameters that add up to at most the given sum, representing each pair of diameters as a 2-satisfiability instance and using a 2-satisfiability algorithm to determine whether that pair can be realized by a clustering. To find the optimal sum of diameters one may perform a binary search in which each step is a feasibility test of this type. The same approach also works to find clusterings that optimize other combinations than sums of the cluster diameters, and that use arbitrary dissimilarity numbers (rather than distances in a metric space) to measure the size of a cluster.<ref>{{citation|first1=P.|last1=Hansen|first2=B.|last2=Jaumard|author2-link= Brigitte Jaumard |title=Minimum sum of diameters clustering|journal=Journal of Classification|volume=4|issue=2|year=1987|pages=215\u2013226|doi=10.1007/BF01896987}}.</ref> The time bound for this algorithm is dominated by the time to solve a sequence of 2-satisfiability instances that are closely related to each other, and {{harvtxt|Ramnath|2004}} shows how to solve these related instances more quickly than if they were solved independently from each other, leading to a total time bound of {{math|''O''(''n''<sup>3</sup>)}} for the sum-of-diameters clustering problem.<ref>{{citation|first1=Sarnath|last1=Ramnath|title=Dynamic digraph connectivity hastens minimum sum-of-diameters clustering|journal=[[SIAM Journal on Discrete Mathematics]]|volume=18|issue=2|pages=272\u2013286|year=2004|doi=10.1137/S0895480102396099}}.</ref>\n\n===Scheduling===\n{{harvtxt|Even|Itai|Shamir|1976}} consider a model of classroom scheduling  in which a set of ''n'' teachers must be scheduled to teach each of ''m'' cohorts of students. The number of hours per week that teacher ''i'' spends with cohort ''j'' is described by entry ''R<sub>ij</sub>'' of a matrix ''R'' given as input to the problem, and each teacher also has a set of hours during which he or she is available to be scheduled. As they show, the problem is [[NP-complete]], even when each teacher has at most three available hours, but it can be solved as an instance of 2-satisfiability when each teacher only has two available hours. (Teachers with only a single available hour may easily be eliminated from the problem.) In this problem, each variable ''v<sub>ij</sub>'' corresponds to an hour that teacher ''i'' must spend with cohort ''j'', the assignment to the variable specifies whether that hour is the first or the second of the teacher's available hours, and there is a 2-satisfiability clause preventing any conflict of either of two types: two cohorts assigned to a teacher at the same time as each other, or one cohort assigned to two teachers at the same time.<ref name=\"EIS76\"/>\n\n{{harvtxt|Miyashiro|Matsui|2005}} apply 2-satisfiability to a problem of sports scheduling, in which the pairings of a [[round-robin tournament]] have already been chosen and the games must be assigned to the teams' stadiums. In this problem, it is desirable to alternate home and away games to the extent possible, avoiding \"breaks\" in which a team plays two home games in a row or two away games in a row. At most two teams can avoid breaks entirely, alternating between home and away games; no other team can have the same home-away schedule as these two, because then it would be unable to play the team with which it had the same schedule. Therefore, an optimal schedule has two breakless teams and a single break for every other team. Once one of the breakless teams is chosen, one can set up a 2-satisfiability problem in which each variable represents the home-away assignment for a single team in a single game, and the constraints enforce the properties that any two teams have a consistent assignment for their games, that each team have at most one break before and at most one break after the game with the breakless team, and that no team has two breaks. Therefore, testing whether a schedule admits a solution with the optimal number of breaks can be done by solving a linear number of 2-satisfiability problems, one for each choice of the breakless team. A similar technique also allows finding schedules in which every team has a single break, and maximizing rather than minimizing the number of breaks (to reduce the total mileage traveled by the teams).<ref>{{citation|first1=Ryuhei|last1=Miyashiro|first2=Tomomi|last2=Matsui|title=A polynomial-time algorithm to find an equitable home\u2013away assignment|journal=Operations Research Letters|volume=33|issue=3|year=2005|pages=235\u2013241|doi=10.1016/j.orl.2004.06.004|citeseerx=10.1.1.64.240}}.</ref>\n\n===Discrete tomography===\n[[File:Paint by numbers Animation.gif|thumb|250px|Example of a nonogram puzzle being solved.]]\n[[Tomography]] is the process of recovering shapes from their cross-sections.\nIn [[discrete tomography]], a simplified version of the problem that has been frequently studied, the shape to be recovered is a [[polyomino]] (a subset of the squares in the two-dimensional [[square lattice]]), and the cross-sections provide aggregate information about the sets of squares in individual rows and columns of the lattice. For instance, in the popular [[nonogram]] puzzles, also known as paint by numbers or griddlers, the set of squares to be determined represents the dark [[pixel]]s in a [[binary image]], and the input given to the puzzle solver tells him or her how many consecutive blocks of dark pixels to include in each row or column of the image, and how long each of those blocks should be. In other forms of digital tomography, even less information about each row or column is given: only the total number of squares, rather than the number and length of the blocks of squares. An equivalent version of the problem is that we must recover a given [[0-1 matrix]] given only the sums of the values in each row and in each column of the matrix.\n\nAlthough there exist polynomial time algorithms to find a matrix having given row and column sums,<ref>{{citation|first=R.

For instance, one might assume that the shape is connected; however, testing whether there exists a connected solution is NP-complete.<ref>{{citation|first=G. J.|last=Woeginger|authorlink= Gerhard J.

They use four 2-satisfiability variables for each square that might be part of the given shape, one to indicate whether it belongs to each of four possible \"corner regions\" of the shape, and they use constraints that force these regions to be disjoint, to have the desired shapes, to form an overall shape with contiguous rows and columns, and to have the desired row and column sums. Their algorithm takes time {{math|O(''m''<sup>3</sup>''n'')}} where {{math|''m''}} is the smaller of the two dimensions of the input shape and {{math|''n''}} is the larger of the two dimensions.

Given a partial solution to the puzzle, they use [[dynamic programming]] within each row or column to determine whether the constraints of that row or column force any of its squares to be white or black, and whether any two squares in the same row or column can be connected by an implication relation. They also transform the nonogram into a digital tomography problem by replacing the sequence of block lengths in each row and column by its sum, and use a [[maximum flow]] formulation to determine whether this digital tomography problem combining all of the rows and columns has any squares whose state can be determined or pairs of squares that can be connected by an implication relation. If either of these two heuristics determines the value of one of the squares, it is included in the partial solution and the same calculations are repeated. However, if both heuristics fail to set any squares, the implications found by both of them are combined into a 2-satisfiability problem and a 2-satisfiability solver is used to find squares whose value is fixed by the problem, after which the procedure is again repeated. This procedure may or may not succeed in finding a solution, but it is guaranteed to run in polynomial time. Batenburg and Kosters report that, although most newspaper puzzles do not need its full power, both this procedure and a more powerful but slower procedure which combines this 2-satisfiability approach with the limited backtracking of {{harvtxt|Even|Itai|Shamir|1976}}<ref name=\"EIS76\"/> are significantly more effective than the dynamic programming and flow heuristics without 2-satisfiability when applied to more difficult randomly generated nonograms.<ref>{{citation|first1=K.

In this class of satisfiability problems, the input is again a formula in conjunctive normal form. It can have arbitrarily many literals per clause but at most one positive literal. {{harvtxt|Lewis|1978}} found a generalization of this class, ''renamable Horn satisfiability'', that can still be solved in polynomial time by means of an auxiliary 2-satisfiability instance. A formula is ''renamable Horn'' when it is possible to put it into Horn form by replacing some variables by their negations. To do so, Lewis sets up a 2-satisfiability instance with one variable for each variable of the renamable Horn instance, where the 2-satisfiability variables indicate whether or not to negate the corresponding renamable Horn variables.\nIn order to produce a Horn instance, no two variables that appear in the same clause of the renamable Horn instance should appear positively in that clause; this constraint on a pair of variables is a 2-satisfiability constraint. By finding a satisfying assignment to the resulting 2-satisfiability instance, Lewis shows how to turn any renamable Horn instance into a Horn instance in polynomial time.<ref>{{citation\n | last = Lewis | first = Harry R. | authorlink = Harry R.

It is a special case of the general [[Boolean satisfiability problem]], which can involve constraints on more than two variables, and of [[constraint satisfaction problem]]s, which can allow more than two choices for the value of each variable. But in contrast to those more general problems, which are [[NP-complete]], 2-satisfiability can be solved in [[polynomial time]].\n\nInstances of the 2-satisfiability problem are typically expressed as [[Boolean logic|Boolean formula]]s of a special type, called [[conjunctive normal form]] (2-CNF) or '''Krom formulas'''. Alternatively, they may be expressed as a special type of [[directed graph]], the [[implication graph]], which expresses the variables of an instance and their negations as vertices in a graph, and constraints on pairs of variables as directed edges. Both of these kinds of inputs may be solved in [[linear time]], either by a method based on [[backtracking]] or by using the [[strongly connected components]] of the implication graph.\n[[Resolution (logic)|Resolution]], a method for combining pairs of constraints to make additional valid constraints, also leads to a polynomial time solution. The 2-satisfiability problems provide one of two major subclasses of the conjunctive normal form formulas that can be solved in polynomial time; the other of the two subclasses is [[Horn-satisfiability]].\n\n2-satisfiability may be applied to geometry and visualization problems in which a collection of objects each have two potential locations and the goal is to find a placement for each object that avoids overlaps with other objects. Other applications include clustering data to minimize the sum of the diameters of the clusters, classroom and sports scheduling, and recovering shapes from information about their cross-sections.\n\nIn [[computational complexity theory]], 2-satisfiability provides an example of an [[NL-complete]] problem, one that can be solved non-deterministically using a logarithmic amount of storage and that is among the hardest of the problems solvable in this resource bound. The set of all solutions to a 2-satisfiability instance can be given the structure of a [[median graph]], but counting these solutions is [[Sharp-P-complete|#P-complete]] and therefore not expected to have a polynomial-time solution. Random instances undergo a sharp phase transition from solvable to unsolvable instances as the ratio of constraints to variables increases past 1, a phenomenon conjectured but unproven for more complicated forms of the satisfiability problem. A computationally difficult variation of 2-satisfiability, finding a truth assignment that maximizes the number of satisfied constraints, has an [[approximation algorithm]] whose optimality depends on the [[unique games conjecture]], and another difficult variation, finding a satisfying assignment minimizing the number of true variables, is an important test case for [[parameterized complexity]].\n\n==Problem representations==\n[[File:Implication graph.svg|thumb|300px|The implication graph for the example 2-satisfiability instance shown in this section.]]\nA 2-satisfiability problem may be described using a [[Boolean expression]] with a special restricted form. It is a [[Logical conjunction|conjunction]] (a Boolean ''and'' operation) of [[Clause (logic)|clauses]], where each clause is a [[disjunction]] (a Boolean ''or'' operation) of two variables or negated variables. The variables or their negations appearing in this formula are known as [[Literal (mathematical logic)|literals]].<ref name=\"cnf\">{{citation|chapter=2.

Such an assignment chooses whether to make each of the variables true or false, so that at least one literal in every clause becomes true. For the expression shown above, one possible satisfying assignment is the one that sets all seven of the variables to true. Every clause has at least one non-negated variable, so this assignment satisfies every clause. There are also 15 other ways of setting all the variables so that the formula becomes true. Therefore, the 2-satisfiability instance represented by this expression is satisfiable.\n\nFormulas in this form are known as 2-CNF formulas. The \"2\" in this name stands for the number of literals per clause, and \"CNF\" stands for [[conjunctive normal form]], a type of Boolean expression in the form of a conjunction of disjunctions.<ref name=\"cnf\"/> They are also called Krom formulas, after the work of [[University of California, Davis|UC Davis]] mathematician Melven R. Krom, whose 1967 paper was one of the earliest works on the 2-satisfiability problem.<ref name=\"Krom1967\">{{citation\n| last1 = Krom | first1 = Melven R.\n| title = The Decision Problem for a Class of First-Order Formulas in Which all Disjunctions are Binary\n| journal = Zeitschrift f\u00fcr Mathematische Logik und Grundlagen der Mathematik\n| volume = 13\n| issue = 1\u20132\n| pages = 15\u201320\n| year = 1967\n| doi = 10.1002/malq.19670130104\n}}.</ref>\n\nEach clause in a 2-CNF formula is [[logical equivalence|logically equivalent]] to an implication from one variable or negated variable to the other. For example, the second clause in the example may be written in any of three equivalent ways:\n:<math>(x_0\\lor\\lnot x_3) \\;\\equiv\\; (\\lnot x_0\\Rightarrow\\lnot x_3) \\;\\equiv\\; (x_3\\Rightarrow x_0).</math>\nBecause of this equivalence between these different types of operation, a 2-satisfiability instance may also be written in [[implicative normal form]], in which we replace each ''or'' clause in the conjunctive normal form by the two implications to which it is equivalent.<ref>{{citation|title=Artificial Intelligence: A Modern Approach|page=282|series=Prentice Hall series in artificial intelligence|first1=Stuart Jonathan|last1=Russell|first2=Peter|last2=Norvig|publisher=Prentice Hall|year=2010|isbn=978-0-13-604259-4}}.</ref>\n\nA third, more graphical way of describing a 2-satisfiability instance is as an [[implication graph]]. An implication graph is a [[directed graph]] in which there is one [[vertex (graph theory)|vertex]] per variable or negated variable, and an edge connecting one vertex to another whenever the corresponding variables are related by an implication in the implicative normal form of the instance. An implication graph must be a [[skew-symmetric graph]], meaning that it has a [[graph automorphism|symmetry]] that takes each variable to its negation and reverses the orientations of all of the edges.<ref name=\"APT79\">{{citation\n | last1 = Aspvall | first1 = Bengt\n | last2 = Plass | first2 = Michael F.\n | authorlink3 = Robert Tarjan | last3 = Tarjan | first3 = Robert E.\n | title = A linear-time algorithm for testing the truth of certain quantified boolean formulas\n | url = http://www.math.ucsd.edu/~sbuss/CourseWeb/Math268_2007WS/2SAT.pdf\n | journal = [[Information Processing Letters]]\n | volume = 8 | issue = 3 | pages = 121\u2013123 | year = 1979\n | doi = 10.1016/0020-0190(79)90002-4}}.</ref>\n\n==Algorithms==\nSeveral algorithms are known for solving the 2-satisfiability problem.

Then the two clauses may be combined to produce a third clause, having the two other literals in the two clauses; this third clause must also be satisfied whenever the first two clauses are both satisfied. For instance, we may combine the clauses <math>(a\\lor b)</math> and <math>(\\lnot b\\lor\\lnot c)</math> in this way to produce the clause <math>(a\\lor\\lnot c)</math>. In terms of the implicative form of a 2-CNF formula, this rule amounts to finding two implications <math>\\lnot a\\Rightarrow b</math> and <math>b\\Rightarrow \\lnot c</math>, and inferring by [[transitive relation|transitivity]] a third implication <math>\\lnot a\\Rightarrow \\lnot c</math>.<ref name=\"Krom1967\"/>\n\nKrom writes that a formula is ''consistent'' if repeated application of this inference rule cannot generate both the clauses <math>(x\\lor x)</math> and <math> (\\lnot x\\lor\\lnot x)</math>, for any variable <math> x</math>. As he proves, a 2-CNF formula is satisfiable if and only if it is consistent. For, if a formula is not consistent, it is not possible to satisfy both of the two clauses <math> (x\\lor x)</math> and <math>(\\lnot x\\lor\\lnot x)</math> simultaneously. And, if it is consistent, then the formula can be extended by repeatedly adding one clause of the form <math> (x\\lor x)</math> or <math> (\\lnot x\\lor\\lnot x)</math> at a time, preserving consistency at each step, until it includes such a clause for every variable. At each of these extension steps, one of these two clauses may always be added while preserving consistency, for if not then the other clause could be generated using the inference rule. Once all variables have a clause of this form in the formula, a satisfying assignment of all of the variables may be generated by setting a variable <math> x</math> to true if the formula contains the clause <math> (x\\lor x)</math> and setting it to false if the formula contains the clause <math>(\\lnot x\\lor\\lnot x)</math>.<ref name=\"Krom1967\"/>\n\nKrom was concerned primarily with [[completeness (logic)|completeness]] of systems of inference rules, rather than with the efficiency of algorithms. However, his method leads to a [[polynomial time]] bound for solving 2-satisfiability problems.\nBy grouping together all of the clauses that use the same variable, and applying the inference rule to each pair of clauses, it is possible to find all inferences that are possible from a given 2-CNF instance, and to test whether it is consistent, in total time {{math|O(''n''<sup>3</sup>)}}, where {{math|''n''}} is the number of variables in the instance. This formula comes from multiplying the number of variables by the {{math|O(''n''<sup>2</sup>)}} number of pairs of clauses involving a given variable, to which the inference rule may be applied. Thus, it is possible to determine whether a given 2-CNF instance is satisfiable in time {{math|O(''n''<sup>3</sup>)}}. Because finding a satisfying assignment using Krom's method involves a sequence of {{math|O(''n'')}} consistency checks, it would take time {{math|O(''n''<sup>4</sup>)}}. {{harvtxt|Even|Itai|Shamir|1976}} quote a faster time bound of {{math|O(''n''<sup>2</sup>)}} for this algorithm, based on more careful ordering of its operations. Nevertheless, even this smaller time bound was greatly improved by the later linear time algorithms of {{harvtxt|Even|Itai|Shamir|1976}} and {{harvtxt|Aspvall|Plass|Tarjan|1979}}.\n\nIn terms of the implication graph of the 2-satisfiability instance, Krom's inference rule can be interpreted as constructing the [[transitive closure]] of the graph. As {{harvtxt|Cook|1971}} observes, it can also be seen as an instance of the [[Davis\u2013Putnam algorithm]] for solving satisfiability problems using the principle of [[Resolution (logic)|resolution]]. Its correctness follows from the more general correctness of the Davis\u2013Putnam algorithm. Its polynomial time bound follows from the fact that each resolution step increases the number of clauses in the instance, which is upper bounded by a quadratic function of the number of variables.<ref>{{citation|first=Stephen A.|last=Cook|authorlink=Stephen Cook|contribution=The complexity of theorem-proving procedures|title=Proc. 3rd ACM Symp.

Certain steps of the algorithms are \"choice points\", points at which a variable can be given either of two different truth values, and later steps in the algorithm may cause it to backtrack to one of these choice points. However, only the most recent choice can be backtracked over. All choices made earlier than the most recent one are permanent.<ref name=\"EIS76\"/>\n\nInitially, there is no choice point, and all variables are unassigned.\nAt each step, the algorithm chooses the variable whose value to set, as follows:\n*If there is a clause both of whose variables are already set, in a way that falsifies the clause, then the algorithm backtracks to its most recent choice point, undoing the assignments it made since that choice, and reverses the decision made at that choice. If there is no choice point, or if the algorithm has already backtracked over the most recent choice point, then it aborts the search and reports that the input 2-CNF formula is unsatisfiable.\n*If there is a clause in which one of the clause's two variables has already been set, and the clause could still become either true or false, then the other variable is set in a way that forces the clause to become true.\n*In the remaining case, each clause is either guaranteed to become true no matter how the remaining variables are assigned, or neither of its two variables has been assigned yet. In this case the algorithm creates a new choice point and sets any one of the unassigned variables to an arbitrarily chosen value.\n\nIntuitively, the algorithm follows all chains of inference after making each of its choices. This either leads to a contradiction and a backtracking step, or, if no contradiction is derived, it follows that the choice was a correct one that leads to a satisfying assignment. Therefore, the algorithm either correctly finds a satisfying assignment or it correctly determines that the input is unsatisfiable.<ref name=\"EIS76\"/>\n\nEven et al. did not describe in detail how to implement this algorithm efficiently. They state only that by \"using appropriate data structures in order to find the implications of any decision\", each step of the algorithm (other than the backtracking) can be performed quickly. However, some inputs may cause the algorithm to backtrack many times, each time performing many steps before backtracking, so its overall complexity may be nonlinear. To avoid this problem, they modify the algorithm so that, after reaching each choice point, it begins simultaneously testing both of the two assignments for the variable set at the choice point, spending equal numbers of steps on each of the two assignments. As soon as the test for one of these two assignments would create another choice point, the other test is stopped, so that at any stage of the algorithm there are only two branches of the backtracking tree that are still being tested. In this way, the total time spent performing the two tests for any variable is proportional to the number of variables and clauses of the input formula whose values are permanently assigned. As a result, the algorithm takes [[linear time]] in total.<ref name=\"EIS76\"/>\n\n===Strongly connected components===\n{{harvtxt|Aspvall|Plass|Tarjan|1979}} found a simpler linear time procedure for solving 2-satisfiability instances, based on the notion of [[strongly connected component]]s from [[graph theory]].<ref name=\"APT79\"/>\n\nTwo vertices in a directed graph are said to be strongly connected to each other if there is a directed path from one to the other and vice versa. This is an [[equivalence relation]], and the vertices of the graph may be partitioned into strongly connected components, subsets within which every two vertices are strongly connected.

[[Kosaraju's algorithm]] performs two depth first searches, but is very simple.\n\nIn terms of the implication graph, two literals belong to the same strongly connected component whenever there exist chains of implications from one literal to the other and vice versa. Therefore, the two literals must have the same value in any satisfying assignment to the given 2-satisfiability instance. In particular, if a variable and its negation both belong to the same strongly connected component, the instance cannot be satisfied, because it is impossible to assign both of these literals the same value. As Aspvall et al. showed, this is a [[necessary and sufficient condition]]: a 2-CNF formula is satisfiable if and only if there is no variable that belongs to the same strongly connected component as its negation.<ref name=\"APT79\"/>\n\nThis immediately leads to a linear time algorithm for testing satisfiability of 2-CNF formulae: simply perform a strong connectivity analysis on the implication graph and check that each variable and its negation belong to different components. However, as Aspvall et al. also showed, it also leads to a linear time algorithm for finding a satisfying assignment, when one exists. Their algorithm performs the following steps:\n*Construct the implication graph of the instance, and find its strongly connected components using any of the known linear-time algorithms for strong connectivity analysis.\n*Check whether any strongly connected component contains both a variable and its negation. If so, report that the instance is not satisfiable and halt.\n*Construct the [[Strongly connected component|condensation]] of the implication graph, a smaller graph that has one vertex for each strongly connected component, and an edge from component {{math|''i''}} to component {{math|''j''}} whenever the implication graph contains an edge {{math|''uv''}} such that {{math|''u''}} belongs to component {{math|''i''}} and {{math|''v''}} belongs to component {{math|''j''}}. The condensation is automatically a [[directed acyclic graph]] and, like the implication graph from which it was formed, it is [[Skew-symmetric graph|skew-symmetric]].\n*[[Topological sorting|Topologically order]] the vertices of the condensation.  In practice this may be efficiently achieved as a side effect of the previous step, as components are generated by Kosaraju's algorithm in topological order and by Tarjan's algorithm in reverse topological order.<ref>{{cite web|last=Harrison|first=Paul|title=Robust topological sorting and Tarjan's algorithm in Python|url=http://www.logarithmic.net/pfh/blog/01208083168|accessdate=9 February 2011}}</ref>\n*For each component in the reverse topological order, if its variables do not already have truth assignments, set all the literals in the component to be true. This also causes all of the literals in the complementary component to be set to false.\n\nDue to the reverse topological ordering and the skew-symmetry, when a literal is set to true, all literals that can be reached from it via a chain of implications will already have been set to true. Symmetrically, when a literal {{math|''x''}} is set to false, all literals that lead to it via a chain of implications will themselves already have been set to false. Therefore, the truth assignment constructed by this procedure satisfies the given formula, which also completes the proof of correctness of the necessary and sufficient condition identified by Aspvall et al.<ref name=\"APT79\"/>\n\nAs Aspvall et al. show, a similar procedure involving topologically ordering the strongly connected components of the implication graph may also be used to evaluate [[True quantified Boolean formula|fully quantified Boolean formulae]] in which the formula being quantified is a 2-CNF formula.<ref name=\"APT79\"/>\n\n==Applications==\n\n===Conflict-free placement of geometric objects===\nA number of exact and approximate algorithms for the [[automatic label placement]] problem are based on 2-satisfiability. This problem concerns placing textual labels on the features of a diagram or map. Typically, the set of possible locations for each label is highly constrained, not only by the map itself (each label must be near the feature it labels, and must not obscure other features), but by each other: every two labels should avoid overlapping each other, for otherwise they would become illegible. In general, finding a label placement that obeys these constraints is an [[NP-hard]] problem. However, if each feature has only two possible locations for its label (say, extending to the left and to the right of the feature) then label placement may be solved in polynomial time. For, in this case, one may create a 2-satisfiability instance that has a variable for each label and that has a clause for each pair of labels that could overlap, preventing them from being assigned overlapping positions. If the labels are all congruent rectangles, the corresponding 2-satisfiability instance can be shown to have only linearly many constraints, leading to near-linear time algorithms for finding a labeling.<ref name=\"fw91\">{{citation|first1=M.|last1=Formann|first2=F.|last2=Wagner|contribution=A packing problem with applications to lettering of maps|title=Proc. 7th ACM Symposium on Computational Geometry|year=1991|pages=281\u2013288|doi=10.1145/109648.109680|isbn=978-0-89791-426-0|title-link=Symposium on Computational Geometry}}.</ref> {{harvtxt|Poon|Zhu|Chin|1998}} describe a map labeling problem in which each label is a rectangle that may be placed in one of three positions with respect to a line segment that it labels: it may have the segment as one of its sides, or it may be centered on the segment.

To find a labeling with a given size, they eliminate squares that, if doubled, would overlap another point, and they eliminate points that can be labeled in a way that cannot possibly overlap with another point's label. They show that these elimination rules cause the remaining points to have only two possible label placements per point, allowing a valid label placement (if one exists) to be found as the solution to a 2-satisfiability instance. By searching for the largest label size that leads to a solvable 2-satisfiability instance, they find a valid label placement whose labels are at least half as large as the optimal solution.

In [[graph drawing]], if the vertex locations are fixed and each edge must be drawn as a circular arc with one of two possible locations (for instance as an [[arc diagram]]), then the problem of choosing which arc to use for each edge in order to avoid crossings is a 2-satisfiability problem with a variable for each edge and a constraint for each pair of placements that would lead to a crossing.

This mirror reversal leaves the module's operations unchanged, but it changes the order of the points at which the input and output signals of the module connect to it, possibly changing how well the module fits into the rest of the design. Boros ''et al.'' consider a simplified version of the problem in which the modules have already been placed along a single linear channel, in which the wires between modules must be routed, and there is a fixed bound on the density of the channel (the maximum number of signals that must pass through any cross-section of the channel). They observe that this version of the problem may be solved as a 2-satisfiability instance, in which the constraints relate the orientations of pairs of modules that are directly across the channel from each other. As a consequence, the optimal density may also be calculated efficiently, by performing a binary search in which each step involves the solution of a 2-satisfiability instance.<ref>{{citation|first1=Endre|last1=Boros|first2=Peter Ladislaw|last2=Hammer|author2-link=Peter Ladislaw Hammer|first3=Michel|last3=Minoux|first4=David J., Jr.|last4=Rader|title=Optimal cell flipping to minimize channel density in VLSI design and pseudo-Boolean optimization|journal=[[Discrete Applied Mathematics]]|volume=90|issue=1\u20133|year=1999|pages=69\u201388|doi=10.1016/S0166-218X(98)00114-0}}.</ref>\n\n===Data clustering===\nOne way of [[data clustering|clustering a set of data points]] in a [[metric space]] into two clusters is to choose the clusters in such a way as to minimize the sum of the [[diameter]]s of the clusters, where the diameter of any single cluster is the largest distance between any two of its points. This is preferable to minimizing the maximum cluster size, which may lead to very similar points being assigned to different clusters. If the target diameters of the two clusters are known, a clustering that achieves those targets may be found by solving a 2-satisfiability instance. The instance has one variable per point, indicating whether that point belongs to the first cluster or the second cluster. Whenever any two points are too far apart from each other for both to belong to the same cluster, a clause is added to the instance that prevents this assignment.\n\nThe same method also can be used as a subroutine when the individual cluster diameters are unknown. To test whether a given sum of diameters can be achieved without knowing the individual cluster diameters, one may try all maximal pairs of target diameters that add up to at most the given sum, representing each pair of diameters as a 2-satisfiability instance and using a 2-satisfiability algorithm to determine whether that pair can be realized by a clustering. To find the optimal sum of diameters one may perform a binary search in which each step is a feasibility test of this type. The same approach also works to find clusterings that optimize other combinations than sums of the cluster diameters, and that use arbitrary dissimilarity numbers (rather than distances in a metric space) to measure the size of a cluster.<ref>{{citation|first1=P.|last1=Hansen|first2=B.|last2=Jaumard|author2-link= Brigitte Jaumard |title=Minimum sum of diameters clustering|journal=Journal of Classification|volume=4|issue=2|year=1987|pages=215\u2013226|doi=10.1007/BF01896987}}.</ref> The time bound for this algorithm is dominated by the time to solve a sequence of 2-satisfiability instances that are closely related to each other, and {{harvtxt|Ramnath|2004}} shows how to solve these related instances more quickly than if they were solved independently from each other, leading to a total time bound of {{math|''O''(''n''<sup>3</sup>)}} for the sum-of-diameters clustering problem.<ref>{{citation|first1=Sarnath|last1=Ramnath|title=Dynamic digraph connectivity hastens minimum sum-of-diameters clustering|journal=[[SIAM Journal on Discrete Mathematics]]|volume=18|issue=2|pages=272\u2013286|year=2004|doi=10.1137/S0895480102396099}}.</ref>\n\n===Scheduling===\n{{harvtxt|Even|Itai|Shamir|1976}} consider a model of classroom scheduling  in which a set of ''n'' teachers must be scheduled to teach each of ''m'' cohorts of students. The number of hours per week that teacher ''i'' spends with cohort ''j'' is described by entry ''R<sub>ij</sub>'' of a matrix ''R'' given as input to the problem, and each teacher also has a set of hours during which he or she is available to be scheduled. As they show, the problem is [[NP-complete]], even when each teacher has at most three available hours, but it can be solved as an instance of 2-satisfiability when each teacher only has two available hours. (Teachers with only a single available hour may easily be eliminated from the problem.) In this problem, each variable ''v<sub>ij</sub>'' corresponds to an hour that teacher ''i'' must spend with cohort ''j'', the assignment to the variable specifies whether that hour is the first or the second of the teacher's available hours, and there is a 2-satisfiability clause preventing any conflict of either of two types: two cohorts assigned to a teacher at the same time as each other, or one cohort assigned to two teachers at the same time.<ref name=\"EIS76\"/>\n\n{{harvtxt|Miyashiro|Matsui|2005}} apply 2-satisfiability to a problem of sports scheduling, in which the pairings of a [[round-robin tournament]] have already been chosen and the games must be assigned to the teams' stadiums. In this problem, it is desirable to alternate home and away games to the extent possible, avoiding \"breaks\" in which a team plays two home games in a row or two away games in a row. At most two teams can avoid breaks entirely, alternating between home and away games; no other team can have the same home-away schedule as these two, because then it would be unable to play the team with which it had the same schedule. Therefore, an optimal schedule has two breakless teams and a single break for every other team. Once one of the breakless teams is chosen, one can set up a 2-satisfiability problem in which each variable represents the home-away assignment for a single team in a single game, and the constraints enforce the properties that any two teams have a consistent assignment for their games, that each team have at most one break before and at most one break after the game with the breakless team, and that no team has two breaks. Therefore, testing whether a schedule admits a solution with the optimal number of breaks can be done by solving a linear number of 2-satisfiability problems, one for each choice of the breakless team. A similar technique also allows finding schedules in which every team has a single break, and maximizing rather than minimizing the number of breaks (to reduce the total mileage traveled by the teams).<ref>{{citation|first1=Ryuhei|last1=Miyashiro|first2=Tomomi|last2=Matsui|title=A polynomial-time algorithm to find an equitable home\u2013away assignment|journal=Operations Research Letters|volume=33|issue=3|year=2005|pages=235\u2013241|doi=10.1016/j.orl.2004.06.004|citeseerx=10.1.1.64.240}}.</ref>\n\n===Discrete tomography===\n[[File:Paint by numbers Animation.gif|thumb|250px|Example of a nonogram puzzle being solved.]]\n[[Tomography]] is the process of recovering shapes from their cross-sections.\nIn [[discrete tomography]], a simplified version of the problem that has been frequently studied, the shape to be recovered is a [[polyomino]] (a subset of the squares in the two-dimensional [[square lattice]]), and the cross-sections provide aggregate information about the sets of squares in individual rows and columns of the lattice. For instance, in the popular [[nonogram]] puzzles, also known as paint by numbers or griddlers, the set of squares to be determined represents the dark [[pixel]]s in a [[binary image]], and the input given to the puzzle solver tells him or her how many consecutive blocks of dark pixels to include in each row or column of the image, and how long each of those blocks should be. In other forms of digital tomography, even less information about each row or column is given: only the total number of squares, rather than the number and length of the blocks of squares. An equivalent version of the problem is that we must recover a given [[0-1 matrix]] given only the sums of the values in each row and in each column of the matrix.\n\nAlthough there exist polynomial time algorithms to find a matrix having given row and column sums,<ref>{{citation|first=R.

Given a partial solution to the puzzle, they use [[dynamic programming]] within each row or column to determine whether the constraints of that row or column force any of its squares to be white or black, and whether any two squares in the same row or column can be connected by an implication relation. They also transform the nonogram into a digital tomography problem by replacing the sequence of block lengths in each row and column by its sum, and use a [[maximum flow]] formulation to determine whether this digital tomography problem combining all of the rows and columns has any squares whose state can be determined or pairs of squares that can be connected by an implication relation. If either of these two heuristics determines the value of one of the squares, it is included in the partial solution and the same calculations are repeated. However, if both heuristics fail to set any squares, the implications found by both of them are combined into a 2-satisfiability problem and a 2-satisfiability solver is used to find squares whose value is fixed by the problem, after which the procedure is again repeated. This procedure may or may not succeed in finding a solution, but it is guaranteed to run in polynomial time. Batenburg and Kosters report that, although most newspaper puzzles do not need its full power, both this procedure and a more powerful but slower procedure which combines this 2-satisfiability approach with the limited backtracking of {{harvtxt|Even|Itai|Shamir|1976}}<ref name=\"EIS76\"/> are significantly more effective than the dynamic programming and flow heuristics without 2-satisfiability when applied to more difficult randomly generated nonograms.<ref>{{citation|first1=K.

In this class of satisfiability problems, the input is again a formula in conjunctive normal form. It can have arbitrarily many literals per clause but at most one positive literal. {{harvtxt|Lewis|1978}} found a generalization of this class, ''renamable Horn satisfiability'', that can still be solved in polynomial time by means of an auxiliary 2-satisfiability instance. A formula is ''renamable Horn'' when it is possible to put it into Horn form by replacing some variables by their negations. To do so, Lewis sets up a 2-satisfiability instance with one variable for each variable of the renamable Horn instance, where the 2-satisfiability variables indicate whether or not to negate the corresponding renamable Horn variables.\nIn order to produce a Horn instance, no two variables that appear in the same clause of the renamable Horn instance should appear positively in that clause; this constraint on a pair of variables is a 2-satisfiability constraint.

{"title_page": "Servaea gens", "text_new": "{{Short description|Ancient Roman family}}\nThe '''gens Servaea''' was a minor [[plebs|plebeian]] family at [[ancient Rome]].  Members of this [[gens]] are first mentioned during the reign of [[Tiberius]], from which time they presumably rose steadily through the [[Roman Empire|imperial]] bureaucracy, attaining the [[Roman consul|consulship]] under [[Domitian]].  A number of inscriptions from the second century or later indicate some of them had settled in [[Africa proconsularis|Africa]], where one family of this gens became particularly illustrious under the [[Antonine dynasty|Antonine]] and [[Severan dynasty|Severan]] dynasties.\n\n==Origin==\nThe [[Roman naming conventions#nomen|nomen]] ''Servaeus'' belongs to a class of gentilicia formed with the suffix ''{{not a typo|-aeus}}'', which was typical among families of [[Oscan language|Oscan]] or [[Umbri]]an derivation.<ref>Chase, p. 120.</ref>  The root resembles and may be cognate with the Latin [[praenomen]] ''[[Servius (praenomen)|Servius]]'', meaning one who \"keeps safe\" or \"preserves\".  In this case, ''Servaeus'' is most likely an Oscan or Umbrian cognate of the more common nomen ''[[Servilia gens|Servilius]]''.<ref>Chase, pp. 154, 155.</ref>  A few of the Servaei mentioned in inscriptions lived in central or southern Italy, and one family of this gens bore the surname ''Sabinus'', suggesting that they were of [[Sabines|Sabine]] origin.<ref name=\"CIL 3 14398\"/><ref name=\"AE 1930 109\"/>\n\n==Praenomina==\nThe chief praenomen of the Servaei was ''[[Quintus (praenomen)|Quintus]]'', with ''[[Lucius (praenomen)|Lucius]]'' and ''[[Gaius (praenomen)|Gaius]]'' evidently being used for younger sons.  All were among the most common names throughout Roman history.  Other praenomina occur infrequently.\n\n==Branches and cognomina==\nThe earliest of the Servaei to rise to prominence bore no surname.  The first [[cognomen]] to appear among the family is ''Longinus'', a diminutive of ''Longus'', a surname originally designating someone who was tall; Servaeus Longinus may have acquired the surname as the son or grandson of a Servaeus Longus, or because he was moderately tall.<ref name=\"Chase 110\">Chase, p. 110.</ref>  The name does not seem to have been passed down to subsequent generations.  ''Sabinus'', borne by two soldiers, a father and son who served in [[Galatia (Roman province)|Galatia]] during the early second century, probably indicated that the family claimed descent from the Sabines, an ancient people of central Italy, some of whom had migrated to Rome at the time of the city's legendary founding in the eighth century BC.<ref>Chase, pp. 113, 114.</ref>\n\n''Innocens'', borne by the two Servaei, perhaps father and son, who attained the consulship under Domitian and [[Trajan]], indicated someone of blameless character, and belonged to a large class of surnames derived from a person's habits.<ref>Chase, pp. 110, 111.</ref><ref>''New College Latin & English Dictionary'', ''s.v. innocens''.</ref>  The full nomenclature of the first Innocens is uncertain, but the second, who held office in AD 101, bore the polyonymous appellation of ''Gaius Sertorius Brocchus Quintus Servaeus Innocens'', probably indicating that he was descended from the more illustrious house of the [[Sertoria (gens)|Sertorii]] through a female line.<ref>Salway, ''What's in a Name?'', pp. 131\u2013133.</ref>  Given the high station that this family reached, it seems possible that the Servaei of [[Gigthi]]s in [[Africa Proconsularis]] was descended from them.\n\nThis family seems to have come to prominence with Quintus Servaeus Macer during the reign of [[Antoninus Pius]].  His surname, ''Macer'', designated someone who was notably lean, but the chief cognomen of this family seems to have been ''Fuscus'', \"dark\", which would likely have referred to someone with dark brown hair.<ref name=\"Chase 110\"/><ref>''New College Latin & English Dictionary'', ''s.v. fuscus''.</ref>  This alternated with ''Firmus'', \"strong\" or \"steadfast\", and ''Felix'', \"happy\" or \"fortunate\".<ref>''New College Latin & English Dictionary'', ''s.vv. firmus, felix''.</ref>  The Servaei Fusci were of [[equites|equestrian]] rank, and seem to have formed part of the nobility of Gigthis, where they served in the local senate, and at least one of them, Quintus Servaeus Fuscus Cornelianus, served in the [[Roman Senate]] and held a number of important positions throughout the [[Roman Empire|Empire]].  Another family of colonial Servaei lived at [[Sbeitla|Sufetula]] in [[Numidia (Roman province)|Numidia]], but it remains unclear whether or how they might have been related to the Fusci.  Some of them bore the surname ''Potitianus'', perhaps commemorating their descent from the ancient [[Potitia (gens)|Potitia gens]].\n\n==Members==\n{{Filiation}}\n\n* [[Quintus Servaeus]], a man of [[praetor]]ian rank, was appointed governor of [[Kingdom of Commagene|Commagene]] in AD 18.  He was among the friends of [[Germanicus]] who accused [[Gnaeus Calpurnius Piso]] of having poisoned the young general.  After the downfall of [[Sejanus]], Servaeus was one of those who were falsely accused of conspiring with the disgraced consul, and condemned; but he avoided execution by giving evidence against Sejanus' accomplices.<ref>Tacitus, ''Annales'', ii. 56, iii. 13, vi. 7.</ref><ref>''PIR'', S. 398.</ref>\n* Servaea \u0186. l.

''Sabinus'', borne by two soldiers, a father and son who served in [[Galatia (Roman province)|Galatia]] during the early second century, probably indicated that the family claimed descent from the Sabines, an ancient people of central Italy, some of whom had migrated to Rome at the time of the city's legendary founding in the eighth century BC.<ref>Chase, pp. 113, 114.</ref>\n\n''Innocens'', borne by the two Servaei, perhaps father and son, who attained the consulship under Domitian and [[Trajan]], indicated someone of blameless character, and belonged to a large class of surnames derived from a person's habits.<ref>Chase, pp. 110, 111.</ref><ref>''New College Latin & English Dictionary'', ''s.v. innocens''.</ref>  The full nomenclature of the first Innocens is uncertain, but the second, who held office in AD 101, bore the polyonymous appelation of ''Gaius Sertorius Brocchus Quintus Servaeus Innocens'', probably indicating that he was descended from the more illustrious house of the [[Sertoria (gens)|Sertorii]] through a female line.<ref>Salway, ''What's in a Name?'', pp. 131\u2013133.</ref>  Given the high station that this family reached, it seems possible that the Servaei of [[Gigthi]]s in [[Africa Proconsularis]] was descended from them.\n\nThis family seems to have come to prominence with Quintus Servaeus Macer during the reign of [[Antoninus Pius]].  His surname, ''Macer'', designated someone who was notably lean, but the chief cognomen of this family seems to have been ''Fuscus'', \"dark\", which would likely have referred to someone with dark brown hair.<ref name=\"Chase 110\"/><ref>''New College Latin & English Dictionary'', ''s.v. fuscus''.</ref>  This alternated with ''Firmus'', \"strong\" or \"steadfast\", and ''Felix'', \"happy\" or \"fortunate\".<ref>''New College Latin & English Dictionary'', ''s.vv. firmus, felix''.</ref>  The Servaei Fusci were of [[equites|equestrian]] rank, and seem to have formed part of the nobility of Gigthis, where they served in the local senate, and at least one of them, Quintus Servaeus Fuscus Cornelianus, served in the [[Roman Senate]] and held a number of important positions throughout the [[Roman Empire|Empire]].  Another family of colonial Servaei lived at [[Sbeitla|Sufetula]] in [[Numidia (Roman province)|Numidia]], but it remains unclear whether or how they might have been related to the Fusci.  Some of them bore the surname ''Potitianus'', perhaps commemorating their descent from the ancient [[Potitia (gens)|Potitia gens]].\n\n==Members==\n{{Filiation}}\n\n* [[Quintus Servaeus]], a man of [[praetor]]ian rank, was appointed governor of [[Kingdom of Commagene|Commagene]] in AD 18.  He was among the friends of [[Germanicus]] who accused [[Gnaeus Calpurnius Piso]] of having poisoned the young general.  After the downfall of [[Sejanus]], Servaeus was one of those who were falsely accused of conspiring with the disgraced consul, and condemned; but he avoided execution by giving evidence against Sejanus' accomplices.<ref>Tacitus, ''Annales'', ii. 56, iii. 13, vi. 7.</ref><ref>''PIR'', S. 398.</ref>\n* Servaea \u0186. l.

No, as in life, there's beauty in uncertainty.\" While praising Glover's songwriting and the features on ''3.15.20'', Jones criticized the production and vocals on a few of the album's tracks.<ref name=\"COS\"/> ''[[The Guardian]]''{{'}}s reviewer Dean Van Nguyen acclaimed the album, saying that \"The actor, comedian and musician Donald Glover has made the first truly outstanding album of the decade, offsetting cultural examinations with moments of sweet levity.\" Nguyen further stated that the themes of the album fits to the present day insecurities with the [[2019\u201320 coronavirus pandemic]], saying that \"The disruption caused by the coronavirus forces us to question how strong the foundations of civilisation really are. Glover never could have seen the pandemic coming when he was recording the album, yet at a time when much of what we thought was strong is weak - what we thought was eternal is potentially fleeting \u2013 ''3.15.20'' captures the insecurity of lived reality and the humanity that truly defines our existence.\"<ref name=\"Nguyen\"/> Sam Moore of ''[[NME]]'' gave the album a favorable review, particularly praising Glover's decision to bring up more private matters on the album, referring to the song \"47.48\". Moore wrote that \"The rolling groove of '47.48' is another highlight: Glovers doomy proclamations about the violent and unjust aspects of society ('little boys playing 'round, shot down') eventually subside for a more optimistic outlook for the future as Glover sweetly interacts with his young son Legend about the people they each love.\" Moore continued by saying that \"Glover\u2019s willingness to share such a candid moment on record is particularly interesting given his past proclivity towards keeping his private life largely offline, and may be a sign that the star is beginning to let his guard down as the outside world continues to try to peer in.\"<ref name=\"NME\"/>\n\nSome reviews were more mixed. Debbie Ijaduola of [[Clash (magazine)|''Clash'']] unfavorably compared the album to Childish Gambino's previous efforts, stating that \"Lacking the strong narrative thrust so apparent on his [Glover's] past albums, the project is incredibly disappointing. From what it looks like, it seems like there was a reason he said he was quitting music.\" However, Ijaduola highlighted the songs \"Algorhythm\", \"42.26\" and \"47.48\" as the album's most enjoyable tracks.<ref name=\"Clash\"/> ''[[Pitchfork (website)|Pitchfork]]''{{'}}s critic Paul A. Thompson stated that \"''3.15.20'' is studded with little hooks and big ideas that serve as lures. Its spiritual largesse is weighed down by impulses carried halfway to their endpoints and moments of frustrating pretense.\" Thompson, alike other reviewers, praised the song \"47.48\", saying that the track \"sounds like a locked-in house band; the lyrics are actually about a crushing and ever-present violence, and the tension mesmerizes. That song ends with a conversation between Glover and his young son about love-sweeter than it sounds on paper, chilling given the juxtaposition.\"<ref name=\"PF\"/>\n\n== Track listing ==\n{{Track listing\n|headline=''3.15.20'' track listing\n| extra_column = Producer(s)\n| total_length = 57:44\n| title1 = 0.00\n| writer1 = {{hlist|[[Donald Glover]]|[[James Francies|James Francies, Jr.]]|Denise Renee}}\n| extra1 = D.

Glover never could have seen the pandemic coming when he was recording the album, yet at a time when much of what we thought was strong is weak - what we thought was eternal is potentially fleeting \u2013 ''3.15.20'' captures the insecurity of lived reality and the humanity that truly defines our existence.\"<ref name=\"Nguyen\"/> Sam Moore of ''[[NME]]'' gave the album a favorable review, particularly praising Glover's decision to bring up more private matters on the album, referring to the song \"47.48\". Moore wrote that \"The rolling groove of '47.48' is another highlight: Glovers doomy proclamations about the violent and unjust aspects of society ('little boys playing 'round, shot down') eventually subside for a more optimistic outlook for the future as Glover sweetly interacts with his young son Legend about the people they each love.\" Moore continued by saying that \"Glover\u2019s willingness to share such a candid moment on record is particularly interesting given his past proclivity towards keeping his private life largely offline, and may be a sign that the star is beginning to let his guard down as the outside world continues to try to peer in.\"<ref name=\"NME\"/>\n\nSome reviews were more mixed. Debbie Ijaduola of [[Clash (magazine)|''Clash'']] unfavorably compared the album to Childish Gambino's previous efforts, stating that \"Lacking the strong narrative thrust so apparent on his [Glover's] past albums, the project is incredibly disappointing. From what it looks like, it seems like there was a reason he said he was quitting music.\" However, Ijaduola highlighted the songs \"Algorhythm\", \"42.26\" and \"47.48\" as the album's most enjoyable tracks.<ref name=\"Clash\"/> ''[[Pitchfork (website)|Pitchfork]]''{{'}}s critic Paul A. Thompson stated that \"''3.15.20'' is studded with little hooks and big ideas that serve as lures. Its spiritual largesse is weighed down by impulses carried halfway to their endpoints and moments of frustrating pretense.\" Thompson, alike other reviewers, praised the song \"47.48\", saying that the track \"sounds like a locked-in house band; the lyrics are actually about a crushing and ever-present violence, and the tension mesmerizes. That song ends with a conversation between Glover and his young son about love-sweeter than it sounds on paper, chilling given the juxtaposition.\"<ref name=\"PF\"/>\n\n== Track listing ==\n{{Track listing\n|headline=''3.15.20'' track listing\n| extra_column = Producer(s)\n| total_length = 57:44\n| title1 = 0.00\n| writer1 = {{hlist|[[Donald Glover]]|[[James Francies|James Francies, Jr.]]|Denise Renee}}\n| extra1 = D.

BCSS are built upon persuasive systems design techniques.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Oinas-Kukkonen |first1=Harri |title=Behavior Change Support Systems: A Research Model and Agenda |journal=Persuasive Technology |volume=6137 |date=2010 |pages=4\u201314 |doi=10.1007/978-3-642-13226-1_3 |bibcode=2010LNCS.6137....4O |isbn=978-3-642-13225-4 |publisher=Springer Berlin Heidelberg |language=en|series=Lecture Notes in Computer Science }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |last1=Fogg |first1=B.

This theory outlines the relationship between attitudes, intention, and the desired behaviour and is one of the most influential determinant models. \nAnother strong influence can be found in the [https://www.behaviormodel.org/ Fogg Behaviour Model] (FBM), which states that any user first needs to be motivated, then to have the ability to perform the change in behaviour, and finally to be triggered by either intrinsic or extrinsic factors <ref>{{cite book |last1=Fogg |first1=B.J. |title=Persuasive technology: using computers to change what we think and do |date=2003 |publisher=Morgan Kaufmann Publishers |isbn=9780080479941}}</ref> (The term \u2018trigger\u2019 was changed by the author in late 2017 and the term \u2018prompt\u2019 is now being used). BCSS makes use of extrinsic (perceptual) prompts like alarms, messages with offers or calls to action, ads, requests, and more. \nOther theories which aid in the design and mechanisms behind a BCSS include the [[Social learning theory|Social Learning Theory]] (SLT) which studies the interactions between a person (user) and the environment<ref>{{cite book |last1=Bandura |first1=Albert |title=Social Learning Theory |date=1971 |publisher=General Learning Press |location=New York}}</ref> and the Theory of Planned Behaviour<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Ajzen |first1=Icek |title=The theory of planned behavior |journal=Organizational Behavior and Human Decision Processes |date=December 1991 |volume=50 |issue=2 |pages=179\u2013211 |doi=10.1016/0749-5978(91)90020-T}}</ref> (initiated as [[Theory of reasoned action|Theory of Reasoned Action]]).\n\n== Techniques and elements ==\nApplications of BCSS may include game and training elements in several market domains, ranging from Health and Education to Quality of Life (QoL), to professional development and workability. Virtually any concept designed with the intention of causing a shift in person's behaviour can be considered a BCSS, even if this change is not directly observed by the users. When users are aware of this intention and choose to work within the system, the chances of favourable results from this system increases. This effect is attributed to [[Metacognition]], as most BCSS systems implement metacognitive strategies for goal attainment<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Grant |first1=Anthony M. |title=The Impact of Life Coaching on Goal Attainment, Metacognition and Mental Health |journal=Social Behavior and Personality: An International Journal |date=1 January 2003 |volume=31 |issue=3 |pages=253\u2013263 |doi=10.2224/sbp.2003.31.3.253}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |last1=Halttu |first1=Kirsi |last2=Oinas-Kukkonen |first2=Harri |title=Persuading to Reflect: Role of Reflection and Insight in Persuasive Systems Design for Physical Health |journal=Human\u2013Computer Interaction |date=27 January 2017 |volume=32 |issue=5\u20136 |pages=381\u2013412 |doi=10.1080/07370024.2017.1283227}}</ref>. Those strategies help users understand the cause of their resistance to adopting a desired behaviour. This requires that they monitor themselves on a daily basis (or whenever the targeted behaviour can be observed) in order to understand their progress towards the desired behaviour, and finally to have recorded evidence (usually objective but also subjective measurements) of their behavioural changes. \n\nBy considering observed behaviours and the distance to the desired behaviour, there can be a positive impact on people who have difficulties in changing their behaviour. This can be achieved by helping them to develop a personalized plan for reaching a targeted behaviour and learning the ways to achieve their personal goals. In most cases, the general objective can be split into more than one objective or step, before the aimed at behaviour is adopted by the users and eventually becomes a routine. This introduces '''self-management''' in BCSS applications since it is particularly helpful for people to take responsibility for their own actions and do things as well as they can.\nBCSS is very often equipped with additional features like '''game elements''' to foster user engagement leading to [[Serious Games]] applications. Moreover, they implement [[Machine Learning]] techniques to predict the future behaviour of users based on their past performance. The evidence of the achieved change in behaviour, as well as important notifications during self-evaluation, are communicated with [[Visual Analytics]] tools, such as performance graphs. \nAdditional tools frequently found on BCSS include checklists and questionnaires to collect users' feedback, hardware sensing components like the [[Internet of Things (IoT)]] devices (e.g. cameras) and social collaboration to help the members of a user community to support each other. Occasionally, some BCSS allow professionals (trainers, educators, medical personnel and social professionals) to participate in the BCSS activities. This can be done by giving advice and support and also by making decisions and alterations to the treatment plan according to the observed performance and the personal needs of the targeted users.\n\n== Taxonomies ==\nMost BCSSs work on a single profile (targeted user), while only a few can monitor and report progress made by a group of people. There are BCSS applications purely made using software, while others include hardware components like sensors and IoT devices to introduce physical computing in a hybrid physical-digital approach<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Fraternali |first1=P. |last2=Baroffio |first2=G. |last3=Pasini |first3=C. |last4=Galli |first4=L. |last5=Micheel |first5=I. |last6=Novak |first6=J. |last7=Rizzoli |first7=A. |title=Integrating Real and Digital Games with Data Analytics for Water Consumption Behavioral Change: A Demo |journal=2015 IEEE/ACM 8th International Conference on Utility and Cloud Computing (UCC) |date=December 2015 |pages=408\u2013409 |doi=10.1109/UCC.2015.68 |url=https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7431443|doi-broken-date=2020-02-28 }}</ref>.\nThe devices used to access a BCSS is usually an internet-connected mobile devices like a smartphone, tablet, or smartwatch. The success in this category of BCSS applications lies in the fact that the sensing and notifications systems of the BCSS can work all day, following the users in daily activities. On the other hand, there are BCSSs which are less intrusive and rely on less frequent access to the system.\nAnother way to distinguish BCSSs is according to the knowledge domain they refer to.

The same is true for students of all ages, and for this reason, gamification is used - rewards, competition and motivational cues of a BCSS help students to start thinking about rejecting their current behaviour or attitude and to take a step towards their targeted behaviour. Prochaska et al. (2007)<ref>{{cite book |title=Changing for good : the revolutionary program that explains the six stages of change and teaches you how to free yourself from bad habits |publisher=W. Morrow |isbn=978-0380725724 |edition=1st}}</ref> proposed a six-stages behavioural change model (Pre-contemplation, Contemplation, Preparation, Action, Maintenance and Termination) which fits very well in educational uses of a BCSS, as it appears an ideal environment for making the first step (Contemplation) after a long period of resistance (Pre-contemplation). BCSSs actually affect the physical world and help people to experiment with an alternative behavioural pattern without thinking of possible coincidences (like social exposure for example). Moreover, the virtual activities performed in a BCSS will help on the next step (Preparation) in which they actually make a transition from a passive to the active state in a safe environment. The user-monitoring and reward system of a BCSS will help users to complete the rest of the stages of the behaviour change (Action, Maintenance and Termination) and avoid a regression to the previous unwanted behaviour.

Some researchers refer to [[Persuasive technology]] to identify the computer-mediated communication between humans or human-computer interaction technologies used to deliver persuasive evidence. A BCSS should be considered as a more complex ICT-based construct which may use persuasive technologies, but also supports the full life-cycle of behavioural change interventions (from authoring to publishing), implements various campaigns to achieve its goals, and is adaptive to specific user profiles.\n\n== Criticism ==\nBCSSs have been criticized for their lack of grounding in a clear behavioural theory, and also the lack of industry standards to measure performance or effect<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Lister |first1=Cameron |last2=West |first2=Joshua H |last3=Cannon |first3=Ben |last4=Sax |first4=Tyler |last5=Brodegard |first5=David |title=Just a Fad?

Another source of criticism refers to the dominant behavioural change models as products of the Theory of Planned Behaviour<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Ajzen |first1=Icek |title=The theory of planned behavior |journal=Organizational Behavior and Human Decision Processes |date=December 1991 |volume=50 |issue=2 |pages=179\u2013211 |doi=10.1016/0749-5978(91)90020-T}}</ref>. According to some researchers<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Kollmuss |first1=Anja |last2=Agyeman |first2=Julian |title=Mind the Gap: Why do people act environmentally and what are the barriers to pro-environmental behavior? |journal=Environmental Education Research |date=July 2010 |volume=8 |issue=3 |pages=239\u2013260 |doi=10.1080/13504620220145401}}</ref> (Kollmus & Agyeman, 2002), there is a gap between 1. attitude and intention, and 2. target behaviour. Thus, it is difficult to find a widely accepted model which is able to take into account all relevant behavioural parameters. Another fact is that even if BCSSs help to achieve a change in targeted user's behaviour, they usually fail to maintain the target behaviour. This may be the result of underestimating the long-term influence that environmental factors have on behaviour.\n\nCurrently, there is an open discussion on how intrusive a BCSS should be, but this seems to be dependent upon the physical and social context of the environment in which the BCSS is being used. As BCSS make use of personal data coming from users' profiles and the user-monitoring system, multiple legal restrictions may be applied to the use of BCSS in everyday life.\n\n== References ==\n<!-- Inline citations added to your article will automatically display here.

This theory outlines the relationship between attitudes, intention, and the desired behaviour and is one of the most influential determinant models. \nAnother strong influence can be found in the [https://www.behaviormodel.org/ Fogg Behaviour Model] (FBM), which states that any user first needs to be motivated, then to have the ability to perform the change in behaviour, and finally to be triggered by either intrinsic or extrinsic factors <ref>{{cite book |last1=Fogg |first1=B.J. |title=Persuasive technology: using computers to change what we think and do |date=2003 |publisher=Morgan Kaufmann Publishers |isbn=9780080479941}}</ref> (The term \u2018trigger\u2019 was changed by the author in late 2017 and the term \u2018prompt\u2019 is now being used). BCSS makes use of extrinsic (perceptual) prompts like alarms, messages with offers or calls to action, ads, requests, and more. \nOther theories which aid in the design and mechanisms behind a BCSS include the [[Social learning theory|Social Learning Theory]] (SLT) which studies the interactions between a person (user) and the environment<ref>{{cite book |last1=Bandura |first1=Albert |title=Social Learning Theory |date=1971 |publisher=General Learning Press |location=New York}}</ref> and the Theory of Planned Behaviour<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Ajzen |first1=Icek |title=The theory of planned behavior |journal=Organizational Behavior and Human Decision Processes |date=December 1991 |volume=50 |issue=2 |pages=179\u2013211 |doi=10.1016/0749-5978(91)90020-T}}</ref> (initiated as [[Theory of reasoned action|Theory of Reasoned Action]]).\n\n== Techniques and elements ==\nApplications of BCSS may include game and training elements in several market domains, ranging from Health and Education to Quality of Life (QoL), to professional development and workability. Virtually any concept designed with the intention of causing a shift in person's behaviour can be considered a BCSS, even if this change is not directly observed by the users. When users are aware of this intention and choose to work within the system, the chances of favourable results from this system increases. This effect is attributed to [[Metacognition]], as most BCSS systems implement metacognitive strategies for goal attainment<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Grant |first1=Anthony M. |title=The Impact of Life Coaching on Goal Attainment, Metacognition and Mental Health |journal=Social Behavior and Personality: An International Journal |date=1 January 2003 |volume=31 |issue=3 |pages=253\u2013263 |doi=10.2224/sbp.2003.31.3.253}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |last1=Halttu |first1=Kirsi |last2=Oinas-Kukkonen |first2=Harri |title=Persuading to Reflect: Role of Reflection and Insight in Persuasive Systems Design for Physical Health |journal=Human\u2013Computer Interaction |date=27 January 2017 |volume=32 |issue=5\u20136 |pages=381\u2013412 |doi=10.1080/07370024.2017.1283227}}</ref>. Those strategies help users understand the cause of their resistance to adopting a desired behaviour. This requires that they monitor themselves on a daily basis (or whenever the targeted behaviour can be observed) in order to understand their progress towards the desired behaviour, and finally to have recorded evidence (usually objective but also subjective measurements) of their behavioural changes. \n\nBy considering observed behaviours and the distance to the desired behaviour, there can be a positive impact on people who have difficulties in changing their behaviour. This can be achieved by helping them to develop a personalized plan for reaching a targeted behaviour and learning the ways to achieve their personal goals. In most cases, the general objective can be split into more than one objective or step, before the aimed at behaviour is adopted by the users and eventually becomes a routine. This introduces '''self-management''' in BCSS applications since it is particularly helpful for people to take responsibility for their own actions and do things as well as they can.\nBCSS is very often equipped with additional features like '''game elements''' to foster user engagement leading to [[Serious Games]] applications. Moreover, they implement [[Machine Learning]] techniques to predict the future behaviour of users based on their past performance. The evidence of the achieved change in behaviour, as well as important notifications during self-evaluation, are communicated with [[Visual Analytics]] tools, such as performance graphs. \nAdditional tools frequently found on BCSS include checklists and questionnaires to collect users' feedback, hardware sensing components like the [[Internet of Things (IoT)]] devices (e.g. cameras) and social collaboration to help the members of a user community to support each other. Occasionally, some BCSS allow professionals (trainers, educators, medical personnel and social professionals) to participate in the BCSS activities. This can be done by giving advice and support and also by making decisions and alterations to the treatment plan according to the observed performance and the personal needs of the targeted users.\n\n== Taxonomies ==\nMost BCSSs work on a single profile (targeted user), while only a few can monitor and report progress made by a group of people. There are BCSS applications purely made using software, while others include hardware components like sensors and IoT devices to introduce physical computing in a hybrid physical-digital approach<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Fraternali |first1=P. |last2=Baroffio |first2=G. |last3=Pasini |first3=C. |last4=Galli |first4=L. |last5=Micheel |first5=I. |last6=Novak |first6=J. |last7=Rizzoli |first7=A. |title=Integrating Real and Digital Games with Data Analytics for Water Consumption Behavioral Change: A Demo |journal=2015 IEEE/ACM 8th International Conference on Utility and Cloud Computing (UCC) |date=December 2015 |pages=408\u2013409 |doi=10.1109/UCC.2015.68 |url=https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7431443|doi-broken-date=2020-02-28 }}</ref>.\nThe devices used to access a BCSS is usually an internet-connected mobile devices like a smartphone, tablet, or smartwatch.

BCSSs are used in education less for imparting knowledge and testing knowledge gained, and more for teaching a difficult subject like \"responsible sexual behaviour\" in middle-school students<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Emery |first1=M. |title=The theory and practice of behaviour change in the school context |journal=International Journal of Health Education |date=1980 |volume=23 |issue=2 |pages=116\u2013125 |issn=0020-7306|pmid=7456673 }}</ref>, or for changing attitudes and beliefs about a topic of interest.\n\nAdopting new behavioural patterns is hard and people see no reason to change their behaviour if they do not recognise the blocking issue. The same is true for students of all ages, and for this reason, gamification is used - rewards, competition and motivational cues of a BCSS help students to start thinking about rejecting their current behaviour or attitude and to take a step towards their targeted behaviour. Prochaska et al. (2007)<ref>{{cite book |title=Changing for good : the revolutionary program that explains the six stages of change and teaches you how to free yourself from bad habits |publisher=W. Morrow |isbn=978-0380725724 |edition=1st}}</ref> proposed a six-stages behavioural change model (Pre-contemplation, Contemplation, Preparation, Action, Maintenance and Termination) which fits very well in educational uses of a BCSS, as it appears an ideal environment for making the first step (Contemplation) after a long period of resistance (Pre-contemplation). BCSSs actually affect the physical world and help people to experiment with an alternative behavioural pattern without thinking of possible coincidences (like social exposure for example). Moreover, the virtual activities performed in a BCSS will help on the next step (Preparation) in which they actually make a transition from a passive to the active state in a safe environment. The user-monitoring and reward system of a BCSS will help users to complete the rest of the stages of the behaviour change (Action, Maintenance and Termination) and avoid a regression to the previous unwanted behaviour. Schmied (2017) proposes a similar 7 step process, the Designing for Behaviour Change (DBC) Framework<ref>{{cite book |last1=Schmied |first1=Petr |title=Behaviour change toolkit : for international development practitioners : enabling people to practice positive behaviours |date=2017 |isbn=978-80-87456-83-5 |pages=60 |url=https://www.clovekvtisni.cz/media/publications/752/file/1498144203-behaviour-change-toolkit-mail.pdf}}</ref>. \nOverall, a positive behavioural change in education settings is facilitated by technology through digital intervention strategies, in which a teacher or educator makes adjustments to personalise the interventions to student's profiles and performance<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Emery |first1=M. |title=The theory and practice of behaviour change in the school context |journal=International Journal of Health Education |date=1980 |volume=23 |issue=2 |pages=116\u2013125 |issn=0020-7306|pmid=7456673 }}</ref>.

Some researchers refer to [[Persuasive technology]] to identify the computer-mediated communication between humans or human-computer interaction technologies used to deliver persuasive evidence. A BCSS should be considered as a more complex ICT-based construct which may use persuasive technologies, but also supports the full life-cycle of behavioural change interventions (from authoring to publishing), implements various campaigns to achieve its goals, and is adaptive to specific user profiles.\n\n== Criticism ==\nBCSSs have been criticized for their lack of grounding in a clear behavioural theory, and also the lack of industry standards to measure performance or effect<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Lister |first1=Cameron |last2=West |first2=Joshua H |last3=Cannon |first3=Ben |last4=Sax |first4=Tyler |last5=Brodegard |first5=David |title=Just a Fad?

Another source of criticism refers to the dominant behavioural change models as products of the Theory of Planned Behaviour<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Ajzen |first1=Icek |title=The theory of planned behavior |journal=Organizational Behavior and Human Decision Processes |date=December 1991 |volume=50 |issue=2 |pages=179\u2013211 |doi=10.1016/0749-5978(91)90020-T}}</ref>. According to some researchers<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Kollmuss |first1=Anja |last2=Agyeman |first2=Julian |title=Mind the Gap: Why do people act environmentally and what are the barriers to pro-environmental behavior? |journal=Environmental Education Research |date=July 2010 |volume=8 |issue=3 |pages=239\u2013260 |doi=10.1080/13504620220145401}}</ref> (Kollmus & Agyeman, 2002), there is a gap between: 1. attitude and intention, and 2. target behaviour. Thus, it is difficult to find a widely accepted model which is able to take into account all relevant behavioural parameters. Another fact is that even if BCSSs help to achieve a change in targeted user's behaviour, they usually fail to maintain the target behaviour. This may be the result of underestimating the long-term influence that environmental factors have on behaviour.\n\nCurrently, there is an open discussion on how intrusive a BCSS should be, but this seems to be dependent upon the physical and social context of the environment in which the BCSS is being used. As BCSS make use of personal data coming from users' profiles and the user-monitoring system, multiple legal restrictions may be applied to the use of BCSS in everyday life.\n\n== References ==\n<!-- Inline citations added to your article will automatically display here.
