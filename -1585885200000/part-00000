Having been the only [[Hollywood]] filmmaker to continue to make [[silent film]]s well into the period of [[sound film]]s, Chaplin made this his first true sound film.\n\nChaplin's film advanced a stirring condemnation of [[Adolf Hitler]], [[Benito Mussolini]], [[fascism]], [[antisemitism]], and the [[Nazism|Nazis]]. At the time of its first release, the United States was still formally at peace with [[Nazi Germany]]. Chaplin plays both leading roles: a ruthless fascist dictator and a persecuted Jewish barber.\n\n''The Great Dictator'' was popular with audiences, becoming Chaplin's most commercially successful film.<ref name=\"trampdict\"/> Modern critics have also praised it as an historically significant film and an important work of [[satire]], and in 1997, it was selected by the [[Library of Congress]] for preservation in the United States [[National Film Registry]] as being \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\".<ref name=\":0\"/> ''The Great Dictator'' was nominated for five [[Academy Awards]]&nbsp;\u2013 [[Academy Award for Best Picture|Outstanding Production]], [[Academy Award for Best Actor|Best Actor]], [[Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay|Best Writing (Original Screenplay)]], [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor|Best Supporting Actor]] for [[Jack Oakie]], and [[Academy Award for Best Original Score|Best Music (Original Score)]].\n\nIn his 1964 autobiography, Chaplin stated that he could not have made the film if he had known about the true extent of the horrors of the [[Nazi concentration camps]] at the time.<ref name=\"ChaplinLager\">{{cite book |last=Chaplin|first=Charlie|authorlink=Charlie Chaplin|date=1964|title=My Autobiography|url=https://archive.org/details/myautobiography00chaprich|url-access=registration|page=[https://archive.org/details/myautobiography00chaprich/page/392 392]|quote=Had I known of the actual horrors of the German concentration camps, I could not have made ''The Great Dictator'', I could not have made fun of the homicidal insanity of the Nazis.}}</ref>\n\n==Plot==\n\nOn the [[Western Front (World War I)|Western Front]] in 1918, a Jewish Private ([[Charlie Chaplin]]) fighting for the [[Central Powers]] nation of Tomainia<ref>The spelling of the country's name is derived from the numerous local newspapers flashed onscreen between 14 and 15 minutes into the film that indicate the end of World War I, such as ''The Tomainian past', thus establishing the proper spelling.</ref> valiantly saves the life of a wounded pilot, Commander Schultz ([[Reginald Gardiner]]), who carries valuable documents that could secure a Tomainian victory. However, their plane crashes mid-flight, and the Private subsequently suffers memory loss. Upon being rescued, Schultz is informed that Tomainia has officially surrendered to the [[Allies of World War I|Allied Forces]], while the Private is carried off to a hospital.\n\n[[File:Dictator charlie2.jpg|thumb|left|Chaplin as Adenoid Hynkel.]]\nTwenty years later, still suffering from amnesia, the Private leaves the hospital to return to his previous profession as a [[barber]] in the [[Jewish ghettos in Europe|ghetto]]. The ghetto is now governed by Schultz, who has been promoted in the Tomainian regime under the ruthless dictator Adenoid Hynkel (also Chaplin).\n\nThe Barber falls in love with a neighbor, Hannah ([[Paulette Goddard]]), and together they try to resist persecution by military forces. The troops capture the Barber and are about to hang him, but Schultz recognizes him and restrains them. By recognizing him, and reminding him of World War I, Schultz helps the Barber regain his memory.\n\nMeanwhile, Hynkel tries to finance his ever-growing military forces by borrowing money from a Jewish banker called Hermann Epstein, but the banker refuses to lend him the money. Furious, Hynkel orders a purge of the Jews. Schultz protests this inhumane policy and is sent to a [[Internment|concentration camp]]. He escapes and hides in the ghetto with the Barber. Schultz tries to persuade the Jewish family to assassinate Hynkel in a [[suicide attack]], but they are dissuaded by Hannah. Troops search the ghetto, arrest Schultz and the Barber, and send both to a concentration camp. Hannah and her family flee to freedom at a vineyard in the neighboring country of Osterlich.\n\nHynkel has a dispute with the dictator of the nation of Bacteria, a man named Benzino Napaloni ([[Jack Oakie]]), over which country should invade Osterlich. The two dictators argue over a treaty to govern the invasion, while dining together at an elaborate buffet, which happens to provide a jar of \"English Mustard\". The quarrel becomes heated and descends into a food fight, which is only resolved when both men eat the hot mustard and are shocked into cooperating. After signing the treaty with Napaloni, Hynkel orders the invasion of Osterlich. Hannah and her family are trapped by the invading force and beaten by a squad of arriving soldiers. The squad leader strikes Hannah to the ground, stands over her, and cruelly eats her basket of grapes.\n\n[[File:Dictator charlie6.jpg|thumb|right|Chaplin as Adenoid Hynkel with [[Jack Oakie]] as Benzino Napaloni.]]\nEscaping from the camp in stolen uniforms, Schultz and the Barber, dressed as Hynkel, arrive at the Osterlich frontier, where a huge victory-parade is waiting to be addressed by Hynkel. The real Hynkel is mistaken for the Barber while out [[Waterfowl hunting|duck hunting]] in civilian clothes and is knocked out and taken to the camp. Schultz tells the Barber to go to the platform and impersonate Hynkel, as the only way to save their lives once they reach Osterlich's capital. The Barber has never given a public speech in his life, but he has no other choice.\n\nThe terrified Barber mounts the steps but is inspired to seize the initiative. Announcing that he (as Hynkel) has had a change of heart, he makes an impassioned plea for brotherhood and goodwill.\n\n<blockquote>\"I'm sorry, but I don't want to be an emperor. That's not my business. I don't want to rule or conquer anyone. I should like to help everyone if possible. Jew\u2014Gentile\u2014Black Man, White. We all want to help one another, human beings are like that. We want to live by each other's happiness. Not by each other's misery. We don't want to hate and despise one another. And this world has room for everyone, and the good Earth is rich can provide for everyone. The way of life can be free and beautiful, but we have lost the way. Greed has poisoned men's souls, has barricaded the world with hate, has goose-stepped us into misery and bloodshed. We have developed speed, but we have shut ourselves in. Machinery that gives us abundance has left us in want. Our knowledge has made us cynical. Our cleverness, hard and unkind. We think too much, and feel too little. More than machinery, we need humanity. More than cleverness, we need kindness and gentleness. Without these qualities life will be violent, and all will be lost. The aeroplane and the radio have brought us closer together. The very nature of these inventions cries out for the goodness in men\u2014cries out for universal brotherhood\u2014for the unity of us all. Even now my voice is reaching millions throughout the world\u2014millions of despairing men, women, and little children\u2014victims of a system that makes men torture and imprison innocent people. To those who can hear me, I say\u2014do not despair. The misery that is now upon us is but the passing of greed\u2014the bitterness of men who fear the way of human progress. The hate of men will pass, and dictators die, and the power they took from the people will return to the people. And so long as men die, liberty will never perish. ...\n\nSoldiers!-don't give yourselves to brutes\u2014men who despise you\u2014enslave you\u2014who regiment your lives\u2014tell you what to do\u2014what to think and what to feel! Who drill you\u2014diet you\u2014treat you like cattle, use you as cannon fodder. Don't give yourselves to these unnatural men\u2014machine men with machine minds and machine hearts! You are not machines! You are not cattle! You are men! You have the love of humanity in your hearts! You don't hate! Only the unloved hate\u2014the unloved and the unnatural!\n\nSoldiers!-Don't fight for slavery! Fight for liberty! In the 17th Chapter of [[Gospel of Luke|St Luke]] it is written: \"the Kingdom of God is within man\"\u2014not one man nor a group of men, but in all men! In you! You, the people have the power\u2014the power to create machines. The power to create happiness! You, the people, have the power to make this life free and beautiful, to make this life a wonderful adventure. Then\u2014in the name of democracy\u2014let us use that power\u2014let us all unite. Let us fight for a new world\u2014a decent world that will give men a chance to work\u2014that will give youth a future and old age a security. By the promise of these things, brutes have risen to power. But they lie! They do not fulfill that promise. They never will! Dictators free themselves but they enslave the people! Now let us fight to fulfill that promise! Let us fight to free the world\u2014to do away with national barriers\u2014to do away with greed, with hate and intolerance. Let us fight for a world of reason, a world where science and progress will lead to all men's happiness.\n\nSoldiers! In the name of democracy, let us all unite!\"</blockquote>\n\nFinally, he addresses a message of hope to Hannah, in case she can hear him.\n\n<blockquote>\"Look up, Hannah. The soul of man has been given wings, and at last he is beginning to fly. He is flying into the rainbow, into the light of hope, into the future, the glorious future that belongs to you, to me, and to all of us.\"<ref>Eidenmuller, Michael E.

Filmmaker [[Luis Bu\u00f1uel]] reports that Clair was horrified by the power of the film, crying out that this should never be shown or the West was lost. Chaplin, on the other hand, laughed uproariously at the film. He used it to inspire many elements of ''The Great Dictator'', and by repeatedly viewing this film, Chaplin could closely mimic Hitler's mannerisms.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.criterion.com/films/27605-the-great-dictator|title=The Great Dictator|website=The Criterion Collection}}</ref>\n\nTrimborn suggests that Chaplin decided to proceed with making ''The Great Dictator'' after viewing Riefenstahl's film.<ref>{{cite book |title=Leni Riefenstahl: A Life |last=Trimborn |first=J\u00fcrgen |year=2007 |publisher=Macmillan |isbn=978-0-374-18493-3 |pages=[https://archive.org/details/leniriefenstahll00trim/page/123 123\u2013124] |url=https://archive.org/details/leniriefenstahll00trim/page/123 |accessdate= }}</ref> Hynkel's rally speech near the beginning of the film, delivered in German-sounding [[gibberish]], is a caricature of Hitler's oratory style, which Chaplin also studied carefully in newsreels.<ref>R.

Chaplin and [[Meredith Willson]] composed the music. Filming began in September 1939 (coincidentally soon after Germany invaded Poland, triggering World War II) and finished six months later.\n\nChaplin wanted to address the escalating violence and repression of Jews by the Nazis throughout the late 1930s, the magnitude of which was conveyed to him personally by his European Jewish friends and fellow artists. The [[Third Reich]]'s repressive nature and [[militarist]] tendencies were well-known at the time. [[Ernst Lubitsch]]'s 1942 ''[[To Be or Not to Be (1942 film)|To Be or Not To Be]]'' dealt with similar themes, and also used a mistaken-identity Hitler figure. But Chaplin later said that he would not have made the film had he known of the true extent of the Nazis' crimes.<ref name=\"trampdict\">[[Branagh, Kenneth]] (Narrator).

He was mobbed by fans on a 1931 trip to [[Berlin]], which annoyed the Nazis. Resenting his style of comedy, they published a book titled ''The Jews Are Looking at You'' (1934), describing the comedian as \"a disgusting Jewish acrobat\" (although Chaplin was not Jewish). [[Ivor Montagu]], a close friend of Chaplin, relates that he sent the comedian a copy of the book and always believed that Chaplin decided to retaliate with making ''Dictator''.<ref>Stratton, David (February 21, 2002).

He wrote:\n\n<blockquote>\nTheir destinies were poles apart. One was to make millions weep, while the other was to set the whole world laughing. Dad could never think of Hitler without a shudder, half of horror, half of fascination. \"Just think\", he would say uneasily, \"he's the madman, I'm the comic.

''The Great Dictator'' does feature several scenes without dialogue more in keeping with Chaplin's earlier films.\n\n==Score==\nThe score was written and directed by [[Meredith Willson]], later known as composer and librettist of the 1957 musical comedy ''[[The Music Man]]'':\n{{quote|I've seen [Chaplin] take a sound track and cut it all up and paste it back together and come up with some of the dangdest effects you ever heard\u2014effects a composer would never think of.

Willson's task was to re-record it with the full studio orchestra, fitting the music to the action. They had planned to do it painstakingly, recording eight measures or less at a time, after running through the whole scene to get the overall idea. Chaplin decided to record the run-through in case anything was usable.

How can the master's music simultaneously signify a desire for lost emotional integrity and for authoritative grandeur?\n\nChaplin's dual use of ''Lohengrin'' points towards unsettling conjunctions of Nazi culture and Hollywood entertainment. Like [[Adorno]], Chaplin understands Wagner as a signifier of both: the birth of [[fascism]] out of the spirit of the total work of art, and the origin of mass culture out of the spirit of the most arduous aesthetic program of the 19th century. Unlike Adorno [who identifies American mass culture and fascist spectacle], Chaplin wants his audience to make crucial distinctions between competing Wagnerianisms...Both...rely on the driving force of utopian desires, on...the promise of self-transcendence and authentic collectivity, but they channel these mythic longings in fundamentally different directions. Although [Chaplin] exposes the puzzling modernity of Nazi politics, Chaplin is unwilling to write off either Wagner or industrial culture. [Chaplin suggests] Hollywood needs Wagner as never before in order to at once condemn the use of fantasy in fascism and warrant the utopian possibilities in industrial culture.<ref>{{cite book |title=The Dark Mirror: German Cinema between Hitler and Hollywood |last=Koepnick |first=Lutz Peter |year=2002 |publisher=University of California Press |isbn= 978-0-520-23311-9 |page=141 }}</ref>}}\n\n==Reception==\nChaplin's film was released nine months after Hollywood's first parody of Hitler, the short subject ''[[You Nazty Spy!]]'' by the [[Three Stooges]], which premiered in January 1940.<ref>{{cite book |title=Fighting the War of Ideas Like a Real War |last=Waller |first=J.

However, in the majority of his so-called tramp films, he was not literally playing a tramp.

Having been the only [[Hollywood]] filmmaker to continue to make [[silent film]]s well into the period of [[sound film]]s, Chaplin made this his first true sound film.\n\nChaplin's film advanced a stirring condemnation of [[Adolf Hitler]], [[Benito Mussolini]], [[fascism]], [[antisemitism]], and the [[Nazism|Nazis]]. At the time of its first release, the United States was still formally at peace with [[Nazi Germany]]. Chaplin plays both leading roles: a ruthless fascist dictator and a persecuted Jewish barber.\n\n''The Great Dictator'' was popular with audiences, becoming Chaplin's most commercially successful film.<ref name=\"trampdict\"/> Modern critics have also praised it as an historically significant film and an important work of [[satire]], and in 1997, it was selected by the [[Library of Congress]] for preservation in the United States [[National Film Registry]] as being \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\".<ref name=\":0\"/> ''The Great Dictator'' was nominated for five [[Academy Awards]]&nbsp;\u2013 [[Academy Award for Best Picture|Outstanding Production]], [[Academy Award for Best Actor|Best Actor]], [[Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay|Best Writing (Original Screenplay)]], [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor|Best Supporting Actor]] for [[Jack Oakie]], and [[Academy Award for Best Original Score|Best Music (Original Score)]].\n\nIn his 1964 autobiography, Chaplin stated that he could not have made the film if he had known about the true extent of the horrors of the [[Nazi concentration camps]] at the time.<ref name=\"ChaplinLager\">{{cite book |last=Chaplin|first=Charlie|authorlink=Charlie Chaplin|date=1964|title=My Autobiography|url=https://archive.org/details/myautobiography00chaprich|url-access=registration|page=[https://archive.org/details/myautobiography00chaprich/page/392 392]|quote=Had I known of the actual horrors of the German concentration camps, I could not have made ''The Great Dictator'', I could not have made fun of the homicidal insanity of the Nazis.}}</ref>\n\n==Plot==\n\nOn the [[Western Front (World War I)|Western Front]] in 1918, a Jewish Private ([[Charlie Chaplin]]) fighting for the [[Central Powers]] nation of Tomainia<ref>The spelling of the country's name is derived from the numerous local newspapers flashed onscreen between 14 and 15 minutes into the film that indicate the end of World War I, such as ''The Tomainian past', thus establishing the proper spelling.</ref> valiantly saves the life of a wounded pilot, Commander Schultz ([[Reginald Gardiner]]), who carries valuable documents that could secure a Tomainian victory. However, their plane crashes mid-flight, and the Private subsequently suffers memory loss. Upon being rescued, Schultz is informed that Tomainia has officially surrendered to the [[Allies of World War I|Allied Forces]], while the Private is carried off to a hospital.\n\n[[File:Dictator charlie2.jpg|thumb|left|Chaplin as Adenoid Hynkel.]]\nTwenty years later, still suffering from amnesia, the Private leaves the hospital to return to his previous profession as a [[barber]] in the [[Jewish ghettos in Europe|ghetto]]. The ghetto is now governed by Schultz, who has been promoted in the Tomainian regime under the ruthless dictator Adenoid Hynkel (also Chaplin).\n\nThe Barber falls in love with a neighbor, Hannah ([[Paulette Goddard]]), and together they try to resist persecution by military forces. The troops capture the Barber and are about to hang him, but Schultz recognizes him and restrains them. By recognizing him, and reminding him of World War I, Schultz helps the Barber regain his memory.\n\nMeanwhile, Hynkel tries to finance his ever-growing military forces by borrowing money from a Jewish banker called Hermann Epstein, but the banker refuses to lend him the money. Furious, Hynkel orders a purge of the Jews. Schultz protests this inhumane policy and is sent to a [[Internment|concentration camp]]. He escapes and hides in the ghetto with the Barber. Schultz tries to persuade the Jewish family to assassinate Hynkel in a [[suicide attack]], but they are dissuaded by Hannah. Troops search the ghetto, arrest Schultz and the Barber, and send both to a concentration camp. Hannah and her family flee to freedom at a vineyard in the neighboring country of Osterlich.\n\nHynkel has a dispute with the dictator of the nation of Bacteria, a man named Benzino Napaloni ([[Jack Oakie]]), over which country should invade Osterlich. The two dictators argue over a treaty to govern the invasion, while dining together at an elaborate buffet, which happens to provide a jar of \"English Mustard\". The quarrel becomes heated and descends into a food fight, which is only resolved when both men eat the hot mustard and are shocked into cooperating. After signing the treaty with Napaloni, Hynkel orders the invasion of Osterlich. Hannah and her family are trapped by the invading force and beaten by a squad of arriving soldiers. The squad leader strikes Hannah to the ground, stands over her, and cruelly eats her basket of grapes.\n\n[[File:Dictator charlie6.jpg|thumb|right|Chaplin as Adenoid Hynkel with [[Jack Oakie]] as Benzino Napaloni.]]\nEscaping from the camp in stolen uniforms, Schultz and the Barber, dressed as Hynkel, arrive at the Osterlich frontier, where a huge victory-parade is waiting to be addressed by Hynkel. The real Hynkel is mistaken for the Barber while out [[Waterfowl hunting|duck hunting]] in civilian clothes and is knocked out and taken to the camp. Schultz tells the Barber to go to the platform and impersonate Hynkel, as the only way to save their lives once they reach Osterlich's capital. The Barber has never given a public speech in his life, but he has no other choice.\n\nThe terrified Barber mounts the steps but is inspired to seize the initiative. Announcing that he (as Hynkel) has had a change of heart, he makes an impassioned plea for brotherhood and goodwill.\n\n<blockquote>\"I'm sorry, but I don't want to be an emperor. That's not my business. I don't want to rule or conquer anyone. I should like to help everyone if possible. Jew\u2014Gentile\u2014Black Man, White. We all want to help one another, human beings are like that. We want to live by each other's happiness. Not by each other's misery. We don't want to hate and despise one another. And this world has room for everyone, and the good Earth is rich can provide for everyone. The way of life can be free and beautiful, but we have lost the way. Greed has poisoned men's souls, has barricaded the world with hate, has goose-stepped us into misery and bloodshed. We have developed speed, but we have shut ourselves in. Machinery that gives us abundance has left us in want. Our knowledge has made us cynical. Our cleverness, hard and unkind. We think too much, and feel too little. More than machinery, we need humanity. More than cleverness, we need kindness and gentleness. Without these qualities life will be violent, and all will be lost. The aeroplane and the radio have brought us closer together. The very nature of these inventions cries out for the goodness in men\u2014cries out for universal brotherhood\u2014for the unity of us all. Even now my voice is reaching millions throughout the world\u2014millions of despairing men, women, and little children\u2014victims of a system that makes men torture and imprison innocent people. To those who can hear me, I say\u2014do not despair. The misery that is now upon us is but the passing of greed\u2014the bitterness of men who fear the way of human progress. The hate of men will pass, and dictators die, and the power they took from the people will return to the people. And so long as men die, liberty will never perish. ...\n\nSoldiers!-don't give yourselves to brutes\u2014men who despise you\u2014enslave you\u2014who regiment your lives\u2014tell you what to do\u2014what to think and what to feel! Who drill you\u2014diet you\u2014treat you like cattle, use you as cannon fodder. Don't give yourselves to these unnatural men\u2014machine men with machine minds and machine hearts! You are not machines! You are not cattle! You are men! You have the love of humanity in your hearts! You don't hate! Only the unloved hate\u2014the unloved and the unnatural!\n\nSoldiers!-Don't fight for slavery! Fight for liberty! In the 17th Chapter of [[Gospel of Luke|St Luke]] it is written: \"the Kingdom of God is within man\"\u2014not one man nor a group of men, but in all men! In you! You, the people have the power\u2014the power to create machines. The power to create happiness! You, the people, have the power to make this life free and beautiful, to make this life a wonderful adventure. Then\u2014in the name of democracy\u2014let us use that power\u2014let us all unite. Let us fight for a new world\u2014a decent world that will give men a chance to work\u2014that will give youth a future and old age a security. By the promise of these things, brutes have risen to power. But they lie! They do not fulfill that promise. They never will! Dictators free themselves but they enslave the people! Now let us fight to fulfill that promise! Let us fight to free the world\u2014to do away with national barriers\u2014to do away with greed, with hate and intolerance. Let us fight for a world of reason, a world where science and progress will lead to all men's happiness.\n\nSoldiers! In the name of democracy, let us all unite!\"</blockquote>\n\nFinally, he addresses a message of hope to Hannah, in case she can hear him.\n\n<blockquote>\"Look up, Hannah. The soul of man has been given wings, and at last he is beginning to fly.

Filmmaker [[Luis Bu\u00f1uel]] reports that Clair was horrified by the power of the film, crying out that this should never be shown or the West was lost. Chaplin, on the other hand, laughed uproariously at the film. He used it to inspire many elements of ''The Great Dictator'', and by repeatedly viewing this film, Chaplin could closely mimic Hitler's mannerisms.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.criterion.com/films/27605-the-great-dictator|title=The Great Dictator|website=The Criterion Collection}}</ref>\n\nTrimborn suggests that Chaplin decided to proceed with making ''The Great Dictator'' after viewing Riefenstahl's film.<ref>{{cite book |title=Leni Riefenstahl: A Life |last=Trimborn |first=J\u00fcrgen |year=2007 |publisher=Macmillan |isbn=978-0-374-18493-3 |pages=[https://archive.org/details/leniriefenstahll00trim/page/123 123\u2013124] |url=https://archive.org/details/leniriefenstahll00trim/page/123 |accessdate= }}</ref> Hynkel's rally speech near the beginning of the film, delivered in German-sounding [[gibberish]], is a caricature of Hitler's oratory style, which Chaplin also studied carefully in newsreels.<ref>R.

Chaplin and [[Meredith Willson]] composed the music. Filming began in September 1939 (coincidentally soon after Germany invaded Poland, triggering World War II) and finished six months later.\n\nChaplin wanted to address the escalating violence and repression of Jews by the Nazis throughout the late 1930s, the magnitude of which was conveyed to him personally by his European Jewish friends and fellow artists. The [[Third Reich]]'s repressive nature and [[militarist]] tendencies were well-known at the time. [[Ernst Lubitsch]]'s 1942 ''[[To Be or Not to Be (1942 film)|To Be or Not To Be]]'' dealt with similar themes, and also used a mistaken-identity Hitler figure. But Chaplin later said that he would not have made the film had he known of the true extent of the Nazis' crimes.<ref name=\"trampdict\">[[Branagh, Kenneth]] (Narrator).

He was mobbed by fans on a 1931 trip to [[Berlin]], which annoyed the Nazis. Resenting his style of comedy, they published a book titled ''The Jews Are Looking at You'' (1934), describing the comedian as \"a disgusting Jewish acrobat\" (although Chaplin was not Jewish). [[Ivor Montagu]], a close friend of Chaplin, relates that he sent the comedian a copy of the book and always believed that Chaplin decided to retaliate with making ''Dictator''.<ref>Stratton, David (February 21, 2002).

He wrote:\n\n<blockquote>\nTheir destinies were poles apart. One was to make millions weep, while the other was to set the whole world laughing.

''The Great Dictator'' does feature several scenes without dialogue more in keeping with Chaplin's earlier films.\n\n==Score==\nThe score was written and directed by [[Meredith Willson]], later known as composer and librettist of the 1957 musical comedy ''[[The Music Man]]'':\n{{quote|I've seen [Chaplin] take a sound track and cut it all up and paste it back together and come up with some of the dangdest effects you ever heard\u2014effects a composer would never think of.

How can the master's music simultaneously signify a desire for lost emotional integrity and for authoritative grandeur?\n\nChaplin's dual use of ''Lohengrin'' points towards unsettling conjunctions of Nazi culture and Hollywood entertainment. Like [[Adorno]], Chaplin understands Wagner as a signifier of both: the birth of [[fascism]] out of the spirit of the total work of art, and the origin of mass culture out of the spirit of the most arduous aesthetic program of the 19th century. Unlike Adorno [who identifies American mass culture and fascist spectacle], Chaplin wants his audience to make crucial distinctions between competing Wagnerianisms...Both...rely on the driving force of utopian desires, on...the promise of self-transcendence and authentic collectivity, but they channel these mythic longings in fundamentally different directions. Although [Chaplin] exposes the puzzling modernity of Nazi politics, Chaplin is unwilling to write off either Wagner or industrial culture. [Chaplin suggests] Hollywood needs Wagner as never before in order to at once condemn the use of fantasy in fascism and warrant the utopian possibilities in industrial culture.<ref>{{cite book |title=The Dark Mirror: German Cinema between Hitler and Hollywood |last=Koepnick |first=Lutz Peter |year=2002 |publisher=University of California Press |isbn= 978-0-520-23311-9 |page=141 }}</ref>}}\n\n==Reception==\nChaplin's film was released nine months after Hollywood's first parody of Hitler, the short subject ''[[You Nazty Spy!]]'' by the [[Three Stooges]], which premiered in January 1940.<ref>{{cite book |title=Fighting the War of Ideas Like a Real War |last=Waller |first=J.

It takes its common and scientific names from the distinctive yellow stripes on the sides of its head. Its loud, clear call often begins twenty or thirty minutes before dawn. It is widespread across eastern and southeastern Australia, in open [[sclerophyll]] forests from coastal dunes to high-altitude [[subalpine area]]s, and [[woodland]]s along creeks and rivers. Comparatively short-billed for a honeyeater, it is thought to have adapted to a diet of flies, spiders, and beetles, as well as nectar and pollen from the flowers of plants, such as ''[[Banksia]]'' and ''[[Grevillea]]'', and soft fruits. It catches insects in flight as well as [[Gleaning (birds)|gleaning]] them from the foliage of trees and shrubs.\n\nSome yellow-faced honeyeaters are sedentary, but hundreds of thousands [[bird migration|migrate]] northwards between March and May to spend the winter in southern [[Queensland]], and return in July and August to breed in southern [[New South Wales]] and [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]].

Above the yellow stripe is a black eye stripe which is broken by a small yellow to off-white patch behind the eye, and below is another distinct black stripe running the length of the yellow line. The chin, throat, and breast are a pale greyish-brown, streaked with slightly darker grey, and the abdomen is light grey. The upper body is a dark greyish-brown to olive-brown. Olive-green outer edges on the [[Flight feather|remiges]] combine to form an olive panel on the folded wing. The bill is black and slightly down-curved, and the gape is cream. The legs and feet are grey-brown. The [[Iris (anatomy)|iris]] is a dusky blue in adult birds, and brown in juveniles. The juvenile is very similar to the adult, with slightly less streaking on the breast, an orange-brown tip on the bill, and a yellower gape; male and female birds are also similar, with the male being slightly larger (on average, {{convert|0.8|g|oz|abbr=on}} heavier); and in the field there are no visible differences between the subspecies. The yellow-faced honeyeater averages {{convert|15|-|17.5|cm|in}} in length, with a wingspan of {{convert|21.5|-|26|cm|in|abbr=on}}, and a weight of {{convert|12.5|-|20.5|g|oz}}, with an average of {{convert|17|g|oz|abbr=on}}).{{sfn|Higgins|Christidis|Ford|2008|p=597}}{{sfn|Higgins|Peter|Steele|2001|p=724}}\n\n===Vocalizations===\nOne of the first birds heard in the morning, the yellow-faced honeyeater utters calls that are full and loud, and extremely varied.

It takes its common and scientific names from the distinctive yellow stripes on the sides of its head. Its loud, clear call often begins twenty or thirty minutes before dawn. It is widespread across eastern and southeastern Australia, in open [[sclerophyll]] forests from coastal dunes to high-altitude [[subalpine area]]s, and [[woodland]]s along creeks and rivers. Comparatively short-billed for a honeyeater, it is thought to have adapted to a diet of flies, spiders, and beetles, as well as nectar and pollen from the flowers of plants, such as ''[[Banksia]]'' and ''[[Grevillea]]'', and soft fruits. It catches insects in flight as well as [[Gleaning (birds)|gleaning]] them from the foliage of trees and shrubs.\n\nSome yellow-faced honeyeaters are sedentary, but hundreds of thousands [[bird migration|migrate]] northwards between March and May to spend the winter in southern [[Queensland]], and return in July and August to breed in southern [[New South Wales]] and [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]]. They form [[Monogamy in animals|socially monogamous]] pairs and lay two or three eggs in a delicate [[cup nest|cup-shaped nest]]. The success rate can be low, and the pairs nest several times during the breeding season.\n\nHoneyeaters' preferred woodland habitat is vulnerable to the effects of land-clearing, grazing, and weeds. As it is common and widespread, the yellow-faced honeyeater is considered by the [[International Union for Conservation of Nature]] (IUCN) to be of [[least concern]] for conservation. It is considered a pest in orchards in some areas.\n\n==Taxonomy==\nThe yellow-faced honeyeater was first [[species description|described]], and placed in the genus ''[[Typical warbler|Sylvia]]'', by ornithologist, [[John Latham (ornithologist)|John Latham]], in his 1801 work, ''Supplementum Indicis Ornithologici, sive Systematis Ornithologiae''.<ref name=latham01>{{cite book | last=Latham | first=John | author-link=John Latham (ornithologist) | year=1801 | title=Supplementum indicis ornithologici sive systematis ornithologiae | place=London | publisher=Leigh & Sotheby | language=Latin | page=liv | url=https://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/page/33261428 }}</ref><ref name=Latham>{{cite journal | last = Schodde| first = Richard | authorlink = Richard Schodde |author2=Dickinson, Edward C. |author3=Steinheimer, Frank D. |author4=Bock, Walter J.  | title = The date of Latham's ''Supplementum Indicis Ornithologici'': 1801 or 1802? | journal = South Australian Ornithologist | volume = 35| issue = 8 | pages = 231\u2013235 | year = 2010| url=http://www.birdssa.asn.au/images/saopdfs/Volume35/2010V35P231.pdf }}</ref> French ornithologist, [[Louis Jean Pierre Vieillot]], described it as ''Melithreptus gilvicapillus'' in 1817, and English zoologist, [[George Robert Gray]], as ''Ptilotis trivirgata'' in 1869.<ref name=\"AFD\">{{cite web|url=https://biodiversity.org.au/afd/taxa/f27e5973-dc69-40d0-af23-ae1c49d6e0b3|title=Subspecies ''Caligavis chrysops chrysops'' (Latham, 1801)|author=Australian Biological Resources Study|date=13 October 2014|work=Australian Faunal Directory|publisher=Department of the Environment, Water, Heritage and the Arts, Australian Government|accessdate=7 January 2017|location=Canberra, Australian Capital Territory}}</ref> The specific name ''chrysops'' is derived from the [[Ancient Greek]] words ''chrysos'' meaning 'gold' and ''prosopo'' meaning 'face', in reference to the stripe of yellow feathers.<ref name=fraser13>{{cite book|last1=Gray|first1=Jeannie|last2=Fraser|first2=Ian|title=Australian Bird Names: A Complete Guide|url=https://books.google.com/?id=W1TCqHVWQp0C&pg=PT199#v=onepage&q=Yellow-faced%20honeyeater%20&f=false|year=2013|publisher=Csiro Publishing|location=Collingwood, Victoria | isbn=978-0-643-10471-6|page=199}}</ref>\n\nThe yellow-faced honeyeater was classified in the genera ''[[Meliphaga]]'' and then ''[[Lichenostomus]]'' until 2011.<ref name=\"AFD\"/> Delineating the latter genus had been systematically contentious, and evaluations of relationships among honeyeaters in the genus, using dense [[taxon]] and [[nucleotide]] sampling, confirmed previous findings that ''Lichenostomus'' is not [[Monophyly|monophyletic]].<ref name =Gardener>{{cite journal| last = Gardner | first = J.L.  | last2 = Trueman |first2=J.W.H. |last3=Ebert|first3=D. |last4=Joseph |first4=L. |last5=Magrath|first5=R.D. | title = Phylogeny and evolution of the ''Meliphagoidea'', the largest radiation of Australian songbirds  | journal = Molecular Phylogenetics and Evolution | volume = 55 | issue =  3| pages = 1087\u20131102 | year = 2010 | issn = 1055-7903  | doi = 10.1016/j.ympev.2010.02.005\n| pmid = 20152917}}</ref> Five species have previously been described as comprising the ''Caligavis'' subgroup, but studies, using the [[Mitochondrial DNA|mitochondrial]] DNA, identified the yellow-faced honeyeater as most closely related to the [[black-throated honeyeater]] (''C. subfrenatus'') and the [[obscure honeyeater]] (''C. obscurus'') of New Guinea; they were, therefore, grouped into the genus ''[[Caligavis]]''.

Above the yellow stripe is a black eye stripe which is broken by a small yellow to off-white patch behind the eye, and below is another distinct black stripe running the length of the yellow line. The chin, throat, and breast are a pale greyish-brown, streaked with slightly darker grey, and the abdomen is light grey. The upper body is a dark greyish-brown to olive-brown. Olive-green outer edges on the [[Flight feather|remiges]] combine to form an olive panel on the folded wing. The bill is black and slightly down-curved, and the gape is cream. The legs and feet are grey-brown. The [[Iris (anatomy)|iris]] is a dusky blue in adult birds, and brown in juveniles. The juvenile is very similar to the adult, with slightly less streaking on the breast, an orange-brown tip on the bill, and a yellower gape; male and female birds are also similar, with the male being slightly larger (on average, {{convert|0.8|g|oz|abbr=on}} heavier); and in the field there are no visible differences between the subspecies.

It has been recorded in coastal [[heath]] when banksias are blooming, and among flowering [[mangrove]]s. It occupies areas infested with weeds such as Scotch broom (''[[Cytisus scoparius]]'') and [[Blackberry|blackberries]], and developed areas including orchards and parks and gardens, where it feeds on cultivated fruit and flowers.

humans remains unclear, as does whether the strain became [[pathogen]]ic before or after the [[spillover event]].<ref name=\"early\" /><ref name=\"PopSciJan\" /><ref name=\"Proximal\" /> Because many of the first individuals found to be infected by the virus were workers at the [[Huanan Seafood Market]],<ref name=\"LancetClinical\" /><ref name=\"LancetCharacteristics\" /> it has been suggested that the strain might have originated from the market.<ref name=\"Proximal\" /><ref name=\"nature feb2020\" /> However, other research indicates that visitors may have introduced the virus to the market, which then facilitated rapid expansion of the infections.<ref name=\"early\" /><ref name=\"XivDecoding\" />\n\nResearch into the [[natural reservoir]] of the virus strain that caused the [[2002\u20132004 SARS outbreak]] has resulted in the discovery of many [[Bat SARS-like coronavirus WIV1|SARS-like bat coronaviruses]], most originating in the ''Rhinolophus'' genus of [[horseshoe bats]], and two viral [[nucleic acid sequence]]s found in samples taken from ''[[Chinese rufous horseshoe bat|Rhinolophus sinicus]]'' show a resemblance of 80% to SARS-CoV-2.<ref name=\"MedVirEvolution\" /><ref name=\"NCBI-Bat\" /><ref name=\"NCBI-Bat2\" /> A third viral nucleic acid sequence from ''[[Intermediate horseshoe bat|Rhinolophus affinis]]'', collected in [[Yunnan|Yunnan province]] and designated RaTG13, has a 96% resemblance to SARS-CoV-2.<ref name=\"NatureZhou\" /><ref name=\"NCBI-Bat3\" /> The WHO considers bats the most likely natural reservoir of SARS-CoV-2,<ref name=\"WHOChinaJoint\" /> but differences between the bat coronavirus and SARS-CoV-2 suggest that humans were infected via an intermediate host.<ref name=\"nature feb2020\" />\n\nA [[metagenomic]] study published in 2019 previously revealed that [[Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus|SARS-CoV]], the strain of the virus that causes [[SARS]], was the most widely distributed coronavirus among a sample of [[Sunda pangolin]]s.<ref name=\"VirusesPangolins\" /> On 7 February 2020, it was announced that researchers from [[Guangzhou]] had discovered a [[pangolin]] sample with a viral nucleic acid sequence \"99% identical\" to SARS-CoV-2.<ref name=\"NaturePang\" /> When released, the results clarified that \"the receptor-binding domain of the S protein of the newly discovered Pangolin-CoV is virtually identical to that of 2019-nCoV, with one [[amino acid]] difference.\"<ref name=\"Isolation\" /> Pangolins are protected under Chinese law, but their [[pangolin trade|poaching and trading]] for use in [[traditional Chinese medicine]] remains common.<ref name=\"TelegraphPangolins\" /><ref name=\"NYT-Ban\" />\n\nMicrobiologists and geneticists in [[Texas]] have independently found evidence of [[reassortment]] in coronaviruses suggesting involvement of pangolins in the origin of SARS-CoV-2.<ref name=\"WongRecombination\" /> However, pangolin coronaviruses found to date only share at most 92% of their whole genomes with SARS-CoV-2, making them less similar than RaTG13 to SARS-CoV-2.<ref name=\"CurrentOrigin\" /> This is insufficient to prove pangolins to be the intermediate host; in comparison, the SARS virus responsible for the 2002\u20132004 outbreak shared 99.8% of its genome with a known [[civet]] coronavirus.<ref name=\"nature

It is a [[Positive-sense single-stranded RNA virus|positive-sense single-stranded RNA]] (+ssRNA) virus. Other coronaviruses are capable of causing illnesses ranging from the [[common cold]] to more severe diseases such as [[Middle East respiratory syndrome]] (MERS). It is the seventh known coronavirus to infect people, after [[Human coronavirus 229E|229E]], [[Human coronavirus NL63|NL63]], [[Human coronavirus OC43|OC43]], [[Human coronavirus HKU1|HKU1]], [[Middle East respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus|MERS-CoV]], and the original SARS-CoV.<ref name=\"NEJM-Novel\" />\n\nLike the SARS-related coronavirus strain implicated in the 2003 SARS outbreak, SARS-CoV-2 is a member of the subgenus ''[[Sarbecovirus]]'' ([[beta-CoV]] lineage B).<ref name=\"NextstrainPhylogeny\" /><ref name=\"Wong2019\" /> Its [[RNA]] sequence is approximately 30,000 [[nucleobase|base]]s in length.<ref name=\"gisaid\"/> SARS-CoV-2 is unique among known betacoronaviruses in its incorporation of a polybasic cleavage site, a characteristic known to increase [[pathogenicity]] and [[Basic reproduction number|transmissibility]] in other viruses.<ref name=\"Proximal\" /><ref name=\"CellWalls\" /><ref name=\"AntiviralCleavage\" />\n\nWith a sufficient number of sequenced [[genome]]s, it is possible to reconstruct a [[phylogenetic tree]] of the mutation history of a family of viruses.

Therefore, they identified 2019-nCoV as a [[Strain (biology)|strain]] of ''[[Severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus]]''.<ref name=\"CoronavirusStudyGroup\" />\n\n===Structural biology===\n[[File:Coronavirus virion structure.svg|alt=Figure of a spherical SARSr-CoV virion showing locations of structural proteins forming the viral envelope and the inner nucleocapsid|thumb|right|Structure of a SARSr-CoV virion]]\n\nEach SARS-CoV-2 [[virion]] is approximately 50\u2013200 [[nanometre]]s in diameter.<ref name=\"LancetCharacteristics\" /> Like other coronaviruses, SARS-CoV-2 has four structural proteins, known as the S (spike), E (envelope), M (membrane), and N ([[nucleocapsid]]) proteins; the N protein holds the RNA genome, and the S, E, and M proteins together create the [[viral envelope]].<ref name=\"WuStructure\" /> The spike protein, which has been imaged at the atomic level using [[cryogenic electron microscopy]],<ref name=\"SCI-20200219\" /><ref name=\"GZM-20200220\" /> is the protein responsible for allowing the virus to attach to and fuse with the [[cell membrane|membrane]] of a host cell.<ref name=\"WuStructure\" />\n\n[[File:6VSB spike protein SARS-CoV-2 monomer in homotrimer.png|thumb|upright|left|alt=SARS-CoV-2 spike homotrimer with one protein subunit highlighted; ACE2 binding domain highlighted|SARS-CoV-2 spike [[homotrimer]] with one [[protein subunit]] highlighted; ACE2 binding domain in magenta]]\n\n[[Protein structure prediction|Protein modeling]] experiments on the spike protein of the virus soon suggested that SARS-CoV-2 has sufficient affinity to the [[angiotensin converting enzyme 2]] (ACE2) receptors of human cells to use them as a mechanism of [[Viral entry|cell entry]].<ref name=\"SCLSModeling\" /> By 22 January 2020, a group in China working with the full virus genome and a group in the United States using [[reverse genetics]] methods independently and experimentally demonstrated that ACE2 could act as the receptor for SARS-CoV-2.<ref name=\"NatureZhou\" /><ref name=\"Letko22Jan2020\" /><ref name=\"NatMicLetko\" /><ref name=\"ElSahly\" /><ref name=\"Gralinski2020\" /><ref name=\"LancetBinding\" /> Studies have shown that SARS-CoV-2 has a higher affinity to human ACE2 than the original SARS virus strain.<ref name=\"SCI-20200219\" /> SARS-CoV-2 may also use [[basigin]] to gain cell entry.<ref name=\"CD147\" />\n\n{{Multiple image | align = right | direction = horizontal | total_width = 400 | image1 = SARS-CoV-2 49531042877.jpg | alt1 = SARS-CoV-2 emerging from a human cell | image2 = SARS-CoV-2 scanning electron microscope image.jpg | alt2 = SARS-CoV-2 virions emerging from a human cell | footer_align = center | footer = Digitally colourised [[Micrograph|electron micrographs]] of SARS-CoV-2 virions (yellow) emerging from human cells [[Cell culture|cultured]] in a laboratory}}\n\nInitial spike protein priming by [[TMPRSS2|transmembrane protease, serine 2]] (TMPRSS2) is essential for entry of SARS-CoV-2.<ref name=\"HoffmanCell\" /> After a SARS-CoV-2 virion attaches to a target cell, the cell's [[protease]] TMPRSS2 cuts open the spike protein of the virus, exposing a [[fusion peptide]].

via [[Fomite|contaminated surfaces]] is another possible cause of infection.<ref name=\"WHO-Workplace\" /> Preliminary research indicates that the virus may remain viable on plastic and steel for up to three days, but does not survive on cardboard for more than one day or on copper for more than four hours;<ref name=\"NEJM-Stability\" /> the virus is inactivated by soap, which destabilises its [[lipid bilayer]].<ref name=\"AtlanticSuccess\" /><ref name=\"NatGeoSoap\" /> Viral RNA has also been found in [[Stool test|stool sample]]s from infected people.<ref name=\"NEJM-FirstUS\" />\n\nWhether the virus is infectious during the [[incubation period]] is uncertain.<ref name=\"ScienceFlawed\" /> On 1 February 2020, the [[World Health Organization]] (WHO) indicated that \"transmission from asymptomatic cases is likely not a major driver of transmission\".<ref name=\"WHO-SR12\" /> However, an epidemiological model of the beginning of the [[2019\u201320 coronavirus pandemic in mainland China|outbreak in China]] suggested that \"pre-symptomatic shedding may be typical among documented infections\" and that [[subclinical infection]]s may have been the source of a majority of infections.<ref name=\"ScienceRapid\" />\n\n===Reservoir===\n[[File:Rhinolophus rouxii.jpg|thumb|upright|right|alt=A horseshoe bat|[[Horseshoe bat]]s are among the most likely [[natural reservoir]]s of SARS-CoV-2]]\n\nThe first known infections from the SARS-CoV-2 strain were discovered in [[Wuhan]], China.<ref name=\"NatureZhou\" /> The original source of viral transmission to humans remains unclear, as does whether the strain became [[pathogen]]ic before or after the [[spillover event]].<ref name=\"early\" /><ref name=\"PopSciJan\" /><ref name=\"Proximal\" /> Because many of the first individuals found to be infected by the virus were workers at the [[Huanan Seafood Market]],<ref name=\"LancetClinical\" /><ref name=\"LancetCharacteristics\" /> it has been suggested that the strain might have originated from the market.<ref name=\"Proximal\" /><ref name=\"nature feb2020\" /> However, other research indicates that visitors may have introduced the virus to the market, which then facilitated rapid expansion of the infections.<ref name=\"early\" /><ref name=\"XivDecoding\" />\n\nResearch into the [[natural reservoir]] of the virus strain that caused the [[2002\u20132004 SARS outbreak]] has resulted in the discovery of many [[Bat SARS-like coronavirus WIV1|SARS-like bat coronaviruses]], most originating in the ''Rhinolophus'' genus of [[horseshoe bats]], and two viral [[nucleic acid sequence]]s found in samples taken from ''[[Chinese rufous horseshoe bat|Rhinolophus sinicus]]'' show a resemblance of 80% to SARS-CoV-2.<ref name=\"MedVirEvolution\" /><ref name=\"NCBI-Bat\" /><ref name=\"NCBI-Bat2\" /> A third viral nucleic acid sequence from ''[[Intermediate horseshoe bat|Rhinolophus affinis]]'', collected in [[Yunnan|Yunnan province]] and designated RaTG13, has a 96% resemblance to SARS-CoV-2.<ref name=\"NatureZhou\" /><ref name=\"NCBI-Bat3\" /> The WHO considers bats the most likely natural reservoir of SARS-CoV-2,<ref name=\"WHOChinaJoint\" /> but differences between the bat coronavirus and SARS-CoV-2 suggest that humans were infected via an intermediate host.<ref name=\"nature feb2020\" />\n\nA [[metagenomic]] study published in 2019 previously revealed that [[Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus|SARS-CoV]], the strain of the virus that causes [[SARS]], was the most widely distributed coronavirus among a sample of [[Sunda pangolin]]s.<ref name=\"VirusesPangolins\" /> On 7 February 2020, it was announced that researchers from [[Guangzhou]] had discovered a [[pangolin]] sample with a viral nucleic acid sequence \"99% identical\" to SARS-CoV-2.<ref name=\"NaturePang\" /> When released, the results clarified that \"the receptor-binding domain of the S protein of the newly discovered Pangolin-CoV is virtually identical to that of 2019-nCoV, with one [[amino acid]] difference.\"<ref name=\"Isolation\" /> Pangolins are protected under Chinese law, but their [[pangolin trade|poaching and trading]] for use in [[traditional Chinese medicine]] remains common.<ref name=\"TelegraphPangolins\" /><ref name=\"NYT-Ban\" />\n\nMicrobiologists and geneticists in [[Texas]] have independently found evidence of [[reassortment]] in coronaviruses suggesting involvement of pangolins in the origin of SARS-CoV-2.<ref name=\"WongRecombination\" /> However, pangolin coronaviruses found to date only share at most 92% of their whole genomes with SARS-CoV-2, making them less similar than RaTG13 to SARS-CoV-2.<ref name=\"CurrentOrigin\" /> This is insufficient to prove pangolins to be the intermediate host; in comparison, the SARS virus responsible for the 2002\u20132004 outbreak shared 99.8% of its genome with a known [[civet]] coronavirus.<ref name=\"nature feb2020\" />\n\n===Phylogenetics and taxonomy===\n{{Infobox genome\n| image   = File:SARS-CoV-2 genome.svg\n| caption = [[Genomic]] organisation of isolate Wuhan-Hu-1, the earliest sequenced sample of

It is a [[Positive-sense single-stranded RNA virus|positive-sense single-stranded RNA]] (+ssRNA) virus. Other coronaviruses are capable of causing illnesses ranging from the [[common cold]] to more severe diseases such as [[Middle East respiratory syndrome]] (MERS).
