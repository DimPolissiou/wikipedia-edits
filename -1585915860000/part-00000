Simply getting close to the walkers risks survivors becoming contaminated, causing Morgan to permanently lose his contaminated staff. As the former manager of the plant, Grace blames herself for the deaths of her friends and is on a mission to find and eliminate the radioactive walkers, herself terminally ill with [[radiation sickness]]. John and June locate the campground where the children possibly came from, only to discover that the residents succumbed to radiation sickness. Grace sets out on her own to hunt down the rest, promising to keep in touch. At the same time, Victor tracks down Daniel, who helps him make contact with Luciana. Though convinced of the problem, Daniel refuses to lend his plane to Victor who he feels will only make things worse based on past experiences. After passing out following a walker attack, Luciana wakes up to discover that someone has cut off walker heads and strung them from a billboard at the truck stop, causing the group to become convinced that they are getting close to something someone does not want them to see.\n| LineColor       = 19A7A9\n}}\n{{Episode list/sublist|Fear the Walking Dead (season 5)\n| EpisodeNumber   = 56\n| EpisodeNumber2  = 3\n| Title           = Humbug's Gulch\n| DirectedBy      = [[Colman Domingo]]\n| WrittenBy       = Ashley Cardiff\n| OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2019|6|16}}\n| Viewers         = 1.76<ref name=\"5.03\">{{cite web |url=https://tvbythenumbers.zap2it.com/daily-ratings/sunday-cable-ratings-june-16-2019/ |title=Sunday cable ratings: 'Fear the Walking Dead' stays steady, 'Big Little Lies' improves |work=TV by the Numbers |first=Alex |last=Welch |date=June 18, 2019 |accessdate=June 18, 2019}}</ref>\n| ShortSummary    = The group begins plotting out the locations of the walker roadblocks while Alicia begins searching for Max's family after hearing a message by them over the radio.

Dwight leads the group to the biggest walker roadblock yet, but they are interrupted by a call from Max.

Daniel reveals that he is angry at Strand not for being shot in the face, but for Strand [[Burning in Water, Drowning in Flame (Fear the Walking Dead)|lying to him about Ofelia]], preventing Daniel from seeing his daughter alive again. Strand and the others rush to Daniel's rescue and Strand uses the plane to eliminate the herd, damaging the engines beyond repair. Daniel forgives Strand and gives the group use of his warehouse while he continues his mission. At the same time, Morgan and Alicia search for Althea and discover in the process that Max, Annie and Dylan are part of a larger group of kids, the children of the people who died of [[radiation sickness]] [[The Hurt That Will Happen|at a nearby camp]].

With Isabelle's helicopter out of fuel and only three days before another team is sent to the area, Althea helps Isabelle make a treacherous climb to get the needed supplies while revealing her own guilt over her brother's death when Althea chose to chase a story instead of staying with him.

After Beckett went [[insane]] after witnessing the effects of the radiation from the [[The Hurt That Will Happen|melting down power plant]], she was forced to kill him.

Morgan tells a story where he and several others helped a woman, Tess, get medicine for her son and convinced them to leave their house for the first time since the outbreak. The tape concludes with everyone pleading with future survivors to help others in any way they can. It is then revealed that the tape is being watched by another survivor, Wes, who is at a gas station. He considers reaching out, but decides against it.

Chuck has been bit and wishes to be killed before he turns. At the mall, Grace starts to feel the effects of the radiation sickness and briefly passes out. Dwight leaves to get medical supplies and vows to return with the caravan the next morning. Alone at the mall, Morgan and Grace share details about their past lives and grow closer together. They find an Urgent Care center, but when they try to get in, a security alarm is triggered, drawing the attention of walkers. As Dwight returns to the caravan, he is captured by Rollie, a member of Logan's crew. Rollie taunts Dwight about Sherry, but Dwight quickly gets the upper hand. Rather than killing him, Dwight decides to free Rollie, but orders him to leave the area and never return. After fighting off the walkers, Morgan and Grace find Chuck on the roof, where he dies peacefully. Grace decides not to utilize the Urgent Care center, not wanting to worry about how much time she has left. The following morning, Morgan and Grace bury Chuck as the caravan arrives. Morgan decides to go support Althea on a separate supply run, leaving Grace behind without admitting his true feelings toward her.\n| LineColor       = 19A7A9\n}}\n{{Episode list/sublist|Fear the Walking Dead (season 5)\n| EpisodeNumber   = 64\n| EpisodeNumber2  = 11\n| Title           = You're Still Here\n| DirectedBy      = K.C.

Elsewhere, Morgan and Althea enter a bank, where Althea puts her tapes of interviews in a safety deposit box. They pick up a distress call from Alicia and attempt to track down the injured man and the stolen truck, but their progress is halted by Logan's crew.

While looking through the manuscript, Alicia discovers the phrase from the trees on the final page, and realizes Wes was the one painting them.

There she is rescued by Rabbi Jason Kessner, who offers her shelter for the night. After helping him fix a light, Charlie believes they can fortify the temple and create a new settlement for the group. John and June arrive, who say it won't work because it's too small and there is no water supply. Charlie has to abandon the idea when walkers breach the temple, forcing everyone to flee.

He receives a distress call from a woman, Serena, who is trapped by walkers at a gas station. Logan radios Clayton for help, but he doesn't answer. He makes a desperate attempt to rescue Serena, but arrives too late and she is devoured by walkers (it is revealed that Clayton was unable to help because Sarah and Wendell stole his truck during the hurricane). A distraught Logan is soon found by a group riding on horseback, led by a woman named Virginia. She says she has been watching him and shares his vision. In the present, Logan's crew arrive at the oil field and a standoff ensues, with Logan declaring they are taking all of the oil. The smoke and fire from the oil field attract countless walkers, forcing everyone to take shelter. A reluctant Sarah saves Logan's life as they hide in an office. Meanwhile, Alicia and Strand receive a call from a woman holed up in the same gas station Serena was. Logan, who is listening, encourages the woman to commit suicide, but she is rescued by Wes. Alicia and Strand arrive, but the woman says they need to leave before the people she ran away from show up. The next morning, the oil field walkers are dispatched and the standoff resumes. Logan appears to have a change of heart, but he and his crew are viciously gunned down by another group. Virginia arrives, and feels they can all help each other. Her offer is declined, and when it appears Virginia is about to have everyone killed, Luciana offers to stay behind to help make gas if everyone else can leave. Virginia agrees, but lets everyone know her offer still stands.\n| LineColor       = 19A7A9\n}}\n{{Episode list/sublist|Fear the Walking Dead (season 5)\n| EpisodeNumber   = 67\n| EpisodeNumber2  = 14\n| Title           = Today and Tomorrow\n| DirectedBy      = [[Sydney Freeland]]\n| WrittenBy       = Richard Naing & David Johnson\n| OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2019|9|15}}\n| Viewers         = 1.31<ref name=\"5.14\">{{cite web |url=https://tvbythenumbers.zap2it.com/daily-ratings/sunday-cable-ratings-sept-15-2019/ |title=Sunday cable ratings: \u2018Fear the Walking Dead\u2019 ticks back down, \u2018Power\u2019 holds |work=TV by the Numbers |first=Alex |last=Welch |date=September 17, 2019 |accessdate=September 17, 2019}}</ref>\n| ShortSummary    = While on a supply run, Grace and Daniel fall into trouble when their truck breaks down and they are chased by a herd.

She explains that due to a [[power plant]] meltdown the year before, there are over sixty radioactive walkers in the area. Simply getting close to the walkers risks survivors becoming contaminated, causing Morgan to permanently lose his contaminated staff. As the former manager of the plant, Grace blames herself for the deaths of her friends and is on a mission to find and eliminate the radioactive walkers, herself terminally ill with [[radiation sickness]]. John and June locate the campground where the children possibly came from, only to discover that the residents succumbed to radiation sickness. Grace sets out on her own to hunt down the rest, promising to keep in touch. At the same time, Victor tracks down Daniel, who helps him make contact with Luciana. Though convinced of the problem, Daniel refuses to lend his plane to Victor who he feels will only make things worse based on past experiences. After passing out following a walker attack, Luciana wakes up to discover that someone has cut off walker heads and strung them from a billboard at the truck stop, causing the group to become convinced that they are getting close to something someone does not want them to see.\n| LineColor       = 19A7A9\n}}\n{{Episode list/sublist|Fear the Walking Dead (season 5)\n| EpisodeNumber   = 56\n| EpisodeNumber2  = 3\n| Title           = Humbug's Gulch\n| DirectedBy      = [[Colman Domingo]]\n| WrittenBy       = Ashley Cardiff\n| OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2019|6|16}}\n| Viewers         = 1.76<ref name=\"5.03\">{{cite web |url=https://tvbythenumbers.zap2it.com/daily-ratings/sunday-cable-ratings-june-16-2019/ |title=Sunday cable ratings: 'Fear the Walking Dead' stays steady, 'Big Little Lies' improves |work=TV by the Numbers |first=Alex |last=Welch |date=June 18, 2019 |accessdate=June 18, 2019}}</ref>\n| ShortSummary    = The group begins plotting out the locations of the walker roadblocks while Alicia begins searching for Max's family after hearing a message by them over the radio.

With Isabelle's helicopter out of fuel and only three days before another team is sent to the area, Althea helps Isabelle make a treacherous climb to get the needed supplies while revealing her own guilt over her brother's death when Althea chose to chase a story instead of staying with him. Isabelle reveals that her group is focusing on the future and rebuilding to the point that its mission is more important than anything and anyone. After Beckett went [[insane]] after witnessing the effects of the radiation from the [[The Hurt That Will Happen|melting down power plant]], she was forced to kill him. Althea eventually leads Isabelle to the tape and destroys it, but Isabelle chooses not to kill her due to their mutual attraction. Isabelle leaves in the helicopter with the tape of Althea's brother's story, lying to her people about encountering anyone. Althea reunites with Morgan, Alicia and Annie's group and also lies about what she learned, keeping her promise to Isabelle.

John finds a note from Sherry asking Dwight to give up the search, but keeps it a secret. After struggling to find a solution, Strand and Charlie arrive to help with the propellers from Daniel's plane using Jim Brauer's old [[hot air balloon]].

He receives a distress call from a woman, Serena, who is trapped by walkers at a gas station. Logan radios Clayton for help, but he doesn't answer. He makes a desperate attempt to rescue Serena, but arrives too late and she is devoured by walkers (it is revealed that Clayton was unable to help because Sarah and Wendell stole his truck during the hurricane). A distraught Logan is soon found by a group riding on horseback, led by a woman named Virginia. She says she has been watching him and shares his vision. In the present, Logan's crew arrive at the oil field and a standoff ensues, with Logan declaring they are taking all of the oil. The smoke and fire from the oil field attract countless walkers, forcing everyone to take shelter. A reluctant Sarah saves Logan's life as they hide in an office. Meanwhile, Alicia and Strand receive a call from a woman holed up in the same gas station Serena was. Logan, who is listening, encourages the woman to commit suicide, but she is rescued by Wes. Alicia and Strand arrive, but the woman says they need to leave before the people she ran away from show up. The next morning, the oil field walkers are dispatched and the standoff resumes. Logan appears to have a change of heart, but he and his crew are viciously gunned down by another group. Virginia arrives, and feels they can all help each other. Her offer is declined, and when it appears Virginia is about to have everyone killed, Luciana offers to stay behind to help make gas if everyone else can leave.
