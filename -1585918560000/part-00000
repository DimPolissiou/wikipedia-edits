From 1804 to 1809, the ''Grande Arm\u00e9e'' scored a series of historic victories that gave the [[First French Empire|French Empire]] an unprecedented grip on power over the [[Europe|European continent]]. Widely acknowledged to be one of the greatest fighting forces ever assembled, it suffered terrible losses during the [[French invasion of Russia]] in 1812 and never recovered its tactical superiority after that campaign.\n\nIt was renamed in 1804 from the army that Napoleon had assembled on the French coast of the [[English Channel]] for the [[Napoleon's planned invasion of the United Kingdom|proposed invasion]] of [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|Britain]]. Napoleon later deployed the army east in order to eliminate the threat of [[Austrian Empire|Austria]] and [[Russian Empire|Russia]], which were part of the [[War of the Third Coalition|Third Coalition]] assembled against France. Thereafter, the name was used for the principal French Army deployed in the [[War of the Third Coalition|campaigns of 1805]] and [[War of the Fourth Coalition|1807]], where it got its prestige, and [[War of the Fifth Coalition|1809]], 1812, and [[War of the Sixth Coalition|1813\u201314]]. In practice, however, the term ''Grande Arm\u00e9e'' is used in English to refer to all of the multinational forces gathered by Napoleon in his campaigns.<ref>Elting, John R.: \"Swords Around a Throne\", pp. 60\u201365. Da Capo Press, 1997.</ref>\n\nThe first ''Grande Arm\u00e9e'' consisted of six [[corps]] under the command of Napoleon's [[Marshal of the Empire|marshals]] and senior generals. When Napoleon discovered that the Austrian and Russian armies were preparing to invade France in late 1805, the ''Grande Arm\u00e9e'' was quickly ordered across the [[Rhine]] into Southern Germany, leading to Napoleon's victories at [[Battle of Ulm|Ulm]] and [[Battle of Austerlitz|Austerlitz]].\n\nThe army grew as Napoleon spread his power across Europe and reached its largest size of 1 million men{{sfn|Mearsheimer|2001|p=285}} at the start of the Russian campaign in 1812. Of those soldiers, 685,000{{sfn|Bodart|1916|p=126}} would participate in the invasion. The contingents were commanded by French generals, except for the [[Duchy of Warsaw|Polish]] corps and an Austrian one. The huge multinational army marched slowly east, and the Russians fell back with its approach. After the capture of [[Battle of Smolensk (1812)|Smolensk]] and victory at [[Battle of Borodino|Borodino]], the ''Grande Arm\u00e9e'' reached Moscow on 14 September 1812. However, the army was already drastically reduced because of deaths and injuries from battles with the Russians, disease (principally [[typhus]]), [[desertion]], and long communication lines. The army spent a month in Moscow but was ultimately forced to march back westward. It started to suffer from cold, starvation and disease, and was constantly harassed by [[Cossacks]] and Russian partisans, resulting in the ''Grande Arm\u00e9e'' being utterly destroyed as a fighting force. Only 120,000 men survived to leave Russia (excluding early deserters). Of these, 50,000 were Austrians, Prussians, and other Germans, 20,000 were Poles, and just 35,000 were Frenchmen.<ref>Zamoyski, p. 536</ref> As many as 380,000 died in the campaign.<ref>[http://entomology.montana.edu/historybug/napoleon/typhus_russia.htm Insects, Disease, and Military History: Destruction of the Grand Arm\u00e9e] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080820045117/http://entomology.montana.edu/historybug/napoleon/typhus_russia.htm |date=2008-08-20 }}</ref>\n\nNapoleon led a new army at the [[Battle of Leipzig|Battle of the Nations]] at [[Leipzig]] in 1813, the [[1814 campaign in north-east France|defence of France]] in 1814, and the [[Waterloo campaign]] in 1815, but the ''Grande Arm\u00e9e'' would never regain its heights of June 1812.\n\n== History ==\n''For a history of the French Army in the period 1792\u20131804 during the wars of the First and Second Coalitions see [[French Revolutionary Army]].''\n\n===1804\u20131806===\n[[File:Premiere-legion-dhonneur.jpg|thumb|Napoleon distributing the first medals of the [[Legion of Honour|''L\u00e9gion d'honneur'']] at Boulogne, August 1804|205x205px]]\n{{See also|Napoleon's planned invasion of the United Kingdom}}\nThe ''Grande Arm\u00e9e'' was originally formed as L'Arm\u00e9e des c\u00f4tes de l'Oc\u00e9an (Army of the Ocean Coasts) intended for the invasion of Britain, at the port of [[Boulogne-sur-Mer|Boulogne]] in 1803. Following Napoleon's coronation as Emperor of the French in 1804, the Third Coalition was formed against him and ''Grande Arm\u00e9e'' turned its sights eastwards in 1805. The ''Grande Arm\u00e9e'' left the Boulogne camps late in August and through a rapid march surrounded General [[Karl Mack von Leiberich|Mack]]'s isolated Austrian Army at the fortress of [[Ulm]]. The [[Ulm campaign]], as it came to be known, resulted in 60,000 Austrian prisoners at the cost of just 2,000 French soldiers. By November, Vienna was taken but Austria refused to capitulate, maintaining an army in the field. In addition, its ally Russia had yet to commit to action. The war would continue for a while longer. Affairs were decisively settled on December 2, 1805, at the [[Battle of Austerlitz]], where the numerically inferior ''Grande Arm\u00e9e'' routed a combined Russo-Austrian army led by Emperor [[Alexander I of Russia|Alexander I]]. The stunning victory led to the [[Treaty of Pressburg (1805)|Treaty of Pressburg]] on December 26, 1805, with the dissolution of the [[Holy Roman Empire]] the following year.<ref name=\"year\">Fisher, Todd & Gregory Fremont-Barnes, ''The Napoleonic Wars: The Rise and Fall of an Empire.'', pp. 36\u201354.</ref>\n\n[[File:Austerlitz-baron-Pascal.jpg|thumb|right|''The [[Battle of Austerlitz]], 2nd December 1805'', by [[Fran\u00e7ois G\u00e9rard]]|287x287px]]\n\nThe alarming increase of French power in Central Europe disturbed [[Kingdom of Prussia|Prussia]], which had remained neutral in the conflicts of the previous year. After much diplomatic wrangling, Prussia secured promises of Russian military aid and the Fourth Coalition against France came into being in 1806. The ''Grande Arm\u00e9e'' advanced into Prussian territory with the famed ''bataillon-carr\u00e9'' (battalion square) system, whereby corps marched in close supporting distances and became vanguards, rearguards, or flank forces as the situation demanded, and decisively defeated the Prussian armies at [[Battle of Jena\u2013Auerstedt|Jena and Auerstedt]], both fought on October 14, 1806. After a legendary pursuit, the French captured about 140,000 Prussians and killed and wounded roughly 25,000. [[Louis-Nicolas Davout|Davout]]'s [[III Corps (Grande Arm\u00e9e)|III Corps]], the victors at Auerstadt, received the honours of first marching into Berlin.

A difficult winter campaign produced nothing but a stalemate, made worse by the [[Battle of Eylau]] on February 7\u20138, 1807, where Russian and French casualties soared for little gain. The campaign resumed in the spring and this time [[Levin August von Bennigsen|Bennigsen]]'s Russian Army was soundly defeated at the [[Battle of Friedland]] on June 14, 1807. This victory produced the [[Treaties of Tilsit]] between France and Russia and Prussia in July, leaving Napoleon with no enemies on the continent.<ref name=\"continent\">Fisher & Fremont-Barnes pp. 76\u201392</ref>\n\n[[Kingdom of Portugal|Portugal]]'s refusal to comply with the [[Continental System]] led to a punitive French expedition in late 1807. This campaign formed the basis for the [[Peninsular War]], which was to last six years and drain the [[First French Empire|First Empire]] of vital resources and manpower. The French attempted to occupy Spain in 1808, but a series of [[Battle of Bail\u00e9n|disasters]] prompted Napoleon to intervene personally later in the year. The 125,000-strong ''Grande Arm\u00e9e'' marched forward, capturing the fortress of [[Burgos]], clearing the way to [[Madrid]] at the [[Battle of Somosierra]], and forcing the Spanish armies to retreat. They then engaged [[John Moore (British soldier)|Moore]]'s British army, prompting the British to withdraw from the [[Iberian Peninsula]] after a heroic action at the [[Battle of Corunna]] on January 16, 1809. The campaign was successful, but it would still be some time before the French were able to occupy Southern Spain.<ref name=\"Spain\">Fisher & Fremont-Barnes pp. 200\u201309</ref>\n\n[[File:Napoleon Wagram.jpg|left|thumb|Napoleon at the [[Battle of Wagram]], 16 July 1809, by [[Horace Vernet]]]]\n\nMeanwhile, a revived Austria was preparing to strike. The [[war hawk]]s at the court of Emperor [[Francis II, Holy Roman Emperor|Francis I]] convinced him to take full advantage of France's preoccupation with Spain. In April 1809, the Austrians opened the campaign without a formal declaration of war and caught the French by surprise. They were too slow to exploit their gains, however, and Napoleon's arrival from Paris finally stabilized the situation. The Austrians were defeated at the [[Battle of Eckm\u00fchl]], fled over the [[Danube River|Danube]], and lost the fortress of [[Ratisbon]]. But they still remained a cohesive, fighting force, which meant further campaigning was required to settle the issue. The French captured Vienna and attempted to cross the Danube via Lobau island southeast of the Austrian capital, but they lost the subsequent [[Battle of Aspern-Essling]], the first defeat for the ''Grande Arm\u00e9e''. A second attempt to cross the river proved more successful in July and set the stage for the two-day [[Battle of Wagram]], where the French emerged victorious, inflicting some 40,000 casualties on the Austrians, but suffering 37,000 themselves. The defeat demoralized the Austrians so heavily that they agreed to an [[armistice]] shortly afterwards. This eventually led to the [[Treaty of Sch\u00f6nbrunn|Peace of Sch\u00f6nbrunn]] in October 1809. The ''Grande Arm\u00e9e'' had brought the Fifth Coalition to an end and the Austrian Empire lost three million subjects as a result of the treaty's border changes.<ref name=\"changes\">Fisher & Fremont-Barnes pp. 113\u201344</ref>\n\n===1810\u20131812===\nWith the exception of Spain, a three-year lull ensued. Diplomatic tensions with Russia, however, became so acute that they eventually led to war in 1812. Napoleon assembled the largest field army he had ever commanded to deal with this menace. On 24 June 1812, shortly before the invasion, the assembled troops with a total strength of 685,000 men were made up of:<ref>Riehn, Richard K.

The behemoth force crossed the [[Neman|Niemen River]] on June 24, 1812, and Napoleon hoped that quick marching could place his men between the two main Russian armies, commanded by [[Michael Andreas Barclay de Tolly|Barclay de Tolly]] and [[Pyotr Bagration]]. However, the campaign was characterized by many frustrations, as the Russians succeeded no less than three times in evading Napoleon's pincers. A final stand for the defence of Moscow led to the massive Battle of Borodino on September 7, 1812. There the ''Grande Arm\u00e9e'' won a bloody but indecisive and arguably [[pyrrhic victory]]. A week after the battle, the ''Grande Arm\u00e9e'' finally entered Moscow only to find the city largely empty and ablaze. Its soldiers were now forced to deal with the fires while hunting down arsonists and guarding the city's historic districts. Napoleon and his army spent over a month in Moscow, vainly hoping that the Russian emperor would respond to the French peace offers. After these efforts failed, the French set out on October 19, now only a shadow of their former selves. The epic retreat over the famous Russian winter dominates popular conceptions of the war, even though over half of the ''Grande Arm\u00e9e'' had been lost during the summer. The French were harassed repeatedly by the converging Russian armies, Marshal [[Michel Ney|Ney]] even conducting a famous rearguard separation between his troops and the Russians, and by the time the [[Berezina River|Berezina]] was reached Napoleon only had about 49,000 troops and 40,000 stragglers of little military value. The resulting [[Battle of Berezina|battle]] and the monumental work of [[Jean Baptiste Ebl\u00e9|Ebl\u00e9]]'s engineers saved the remnants of the ''Grande Arm\u00e9e''. Napoleon left his men in order to reach Paris and address new military and political matters. Of the 685,000 men that constituted the initial invasion force, only 93,000 survived.<ref name=\"survived\">Fisher & Fremont-Barnes pp. 145\u201371</ref>\n\n{{wide image|Minard.png|750px|3=[[Charles Joseph Minard]]'s famous graph showing the decreasing size of the Grande Arm\u00e9e as it marches to Moscow (brown line, from left to right) and back (black line, from right to left) with the size of the army equal to the width of the line.

With customary genius, Napoleon raised new armies and opened up the campaign with a series of victories at [[Battle of L\u00fctzen (1813)|L\u00fctzen]] and [[Battle of Bautzen|Bautzen]]. But due to the poor quality of French troops and cavalry following the Russian campaign, along with miscalculations by certain subordinate marshals, these triumphs were not decisive enough to win the war and only secured an armistice. Napoleon hoped to use this respite to increase the quantity and improve the quality of the ''Grande Arm\u00e9e'', but when Austria joined the Allies, his strategic situation grew bleak. The campaign reopened in August with a significant French victory at the two-day [[Battle of Dresden]]. However, the adoption of the [[Trachenberg Plan]] by the Allies, which called for avoiding direct conflict with Napoleon and focusing on his subordinates, paid dividends as the French suffered defeats at [[Battle of the Katzbach|Katzbach]], [[Battle of Kulm|Kulm]], [[Battle of Gro\u00dfbeeren|Gro\u00dfbeeren]], and [[Battle of Dennewitz|Dennewitz]]. Growing Allied numbers eventually hemmed the French in at Leipzig, where the famous three-day Battle of the Nations witnessed a heavy loss for Napoleon when a bridge was prematurely destroyed, abandoning 30,000 French soldiers on the other side of the [[White Elster|Elster River]]. The campaign, however, did end on a victorious note when the French destroyed an isolated Bavarian corps which was trying to block their retreat at [[Battle of Hanau|Hanau]].<ref name=\"hanau\">Fisher & Fremont-Barnes pp. 271\u201387</ref>\n\n[[File:Jean-Louis-Ernest Meissonier-Campagne de France.jpg|thumb|right|''Napoleon and his staff are returning from Soissons after the [[Battle of Laon|battle of Laon]]'', by [[Ernest Meissonier]]|222x222px]]\n\n\"The Grand Empire is no more. It is France herself we must now defend\" were Napoleon's words to the Senate at the end of 1813. The emperor managed to raise new armies, but strategically he was in a virtually hopeless position. Allied armies were invading from the [[Pyrenees]], across the plains of Northern Italy, and via France's eastern borders as well. The campaign began ominously when Napoleon suffered a defeat at the [[Battle of La Rothi\u00e8re]], but he quickly regained his former spirit. In the [[Six Days' Campaign|Six Days' campaign]] of February 1814, the 30,000-man ''Grande Arm\u00e9e'' inflicted 20,000 casualties on [[Gebhard Leberecht von Bl\u00fccher|Bl\u00fccher]]'s scattered corps at a cost of just 2,000 for themselves. They then headed south and defeated [[Karl Philipp, Prince of Schwarzenberg|Schwarzenberg]]'s corps at the [[Battle of Montereau]]. These victories, however, could not remedy such a bad situation, and French defeats at the [[Battle of Laon]] and the [[Battle of Arcis-sur-Aube]] dampened moods. At the end of March, [[Battle of Paris (1814)|Paris fell to the Allies]]. Napoleon wanted to keep fighting, but his marshals refused, forcing him to abdicate on April 6, 1814.<ref name=\"abdicate\">Fisher & Fremont-Barnes pp. 287\u201397</ref>\n\n[[File:Battle of Waterloo 1815.PNG|thumb|left|The [[Battle of Waterloo]] marked the final defeat of Napoleon and the ''Grande Arm\u00e9e'', as well as the end of the Napoleonic Wars.|285x285px]]\n\nAfter returning from exile on [[Principality of Elba|Elba]] in February 1815, Napoleon busied himself in making a renewed push to secure his empire. For the first time since 1812, the [[Army of the North (France)|Army of the North]] he would be commanding for the upcoming campaign was professional and competent. Napoleon hoped to catch and defeat the Allied armies under [[Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington|Wellington]] and Bl\u00fccher in Belgium before the Russians and Austrians could arrive. The campaign, beginning on June 15, 1815, was initially successful, leading to victory over the Prussians at the [[Battle of Ligny]] on June 16; however, poor staff work, and bad commanders led to many problems for the ''Grande Arm\u00e9e'' throughout the entire campaign. Marshal [[Emmanuel de Grouchy, marquis de Grouchy|Grouchy]]'s delayed advance against the Prussians allowed Bl\u00fccher to rally his men after Ligny and march on to Wellington's aid at the [[Battle of Waterloo]], which resulted in the final, decisive defeat for Napoleon.<ref name=\"army\">Fisher & Fremont-Barnes pp. 306\u201312</ref>\n\n== Staff system ==\nPrior to the late 18th century, there was generally no organisational support for staff functions such as [[military intelligence]], [[logistics]], planning or personnel. [[Military organization|Unit]] [[Commanding officer|commanders]] handled such functions for their units, with informal help from subordinates who were usually not trained for or assigned to a specific task.\n\nThe first modern use of a General Staff was in the [[French Revolutionary Wars]], when General [[Louis-Alexandre Berthier]] (later Marshal of the Empire) was assigned as Chief of Staff to the [[Army of Italy (France)|Army of Italy]] in 1795. Berthier was able to establish a well-organised staff support team. Napoleon took over the army the following year and quickly came to appreciate Berthier's system, adopting it for his own headquarters, although Napoleon's usage was limited to his own command group.\n\nThe Staff of the ''Grande Arm\u00e9e'' was known as the Imperial Headquarters and was divided into two major sections: Napoleon's Military Household and the Army General Headquarters. A third department dependent on the Imperial Headquarters was the office of the ''Intendant G\u00e9n\u00e9ral'' (Quartermaster General), providing the administrative staff of the army.<ref name=McNab40>McNab, p. 40.</ref>\n\n=== Napoleon's Military Household ===\n[[File:Napoleon bivouac Wagram.jpg|thumb|upright=1.4|Napoleon snatching a moment's rest on the battlefield of Wagram, with his staff and household working around him]]\nThe Maison Militaire de l'Empereur ([[Military Household of the Emperor]]) was Napoleon's personal military staff and included the department of [[Aide-de-camp|aides-de-camp]] (ADCs), orderly officers (until 1809), the Emperor's Cabinet with the Secretariat, a department that collected intelligence about the enemy using spies and the topographical department.<ref name=McNab40/> Attached was also the Emperor's Civil Cabinet that included the office of the [[Grand Marshal of the Palace]] and the [[Master of the Horse#The French Master of the Horse|Grand \u00c9cuyer]].\n\nThe ADCs to the emperor were mainly loyal, experienced generals or, at times, other senior officers whom he knew from his Italian or [[French campaign in Egypt and Syria|Egyptian]] campaigns. All were famous for their bravery and were experts in their own branches of service. Working directly under the supervision of the emperor, these officers were sometimes assigned to temporary command of units or formations or entrusted with diplomatic missions. Most of the time, however, their tasks consisted of making detailed inspection tours and long-distance reconnaissances. When they had to carry orders from the emperor to an army commander, these would be verbal rather than written. The appointment of ADC to the emperor was so influential that they were considered to be \"Napoleon's eyes and ears\" and even marshals were wise to follow their advice and render them the respect due to their function.<ref>McNab, pp. 40\u201342.</ref>\n\nOn 29 April 1809, a decree organised their service. Every morning at 0700, the duty ADC and his staff were relieved and the new ADC for the next 24 hours had to present the emperor with a list of names of the staff under his command. This would consist of two supplementary daytime general ADCs and one night ADC, one equerry and (through a rotation system) half the number of orderly officers, half the number of the ''petits aides de camp'' (two or three personal ADCs to the general ADCs, who might also be commanded directly by the emperor) and half the number of pages. Their number differed from time to time, but only 37 officers were ever commissioned ADC to the emperor and at normal times their number was restricted to 12. Each of these officers wore the normal general's uniform of his rank, but with gold [[aiguilette]]s as the symbol of his function. The appointment of ADC to the emperor did not always last as long as the emperor's reign; an ADC might be given another position such as a field command, a governorship, etc. and would be removed from his ADC status until recalled to that post.<ref>McNab, p. 42.</ref>\n\nThe ''officiers d'ordonnance'' (orderly officers) may be considered as junior ADCs, with the rank of ''[[chef d'escadron]]'', [[Captain (armed forces)|captain]] or [[lieutenant]]. They, too, were used for special missions such as reconnaissance and inspections, but also to carry written orders. In 1806, when these posts were created, they were members of the [[Imperial Guard (Napoleon I)|Imperial Guard]]; in 1809, while retaining their military status, they were taken under control of the ''Grand \u00c9cuyer'' in the Emperor's Civil Household. The decrees regulating their service were signed on 15, 19 and 24 September 1806 and finally on 19 September 1809.<ref>McNab, pp. 42\u201344.</ref>\n\n=== Army General Headquarters ===\nAlongside the Emperor's Military Household but functioning as a totally independent organisation was the ''Grand \u00c9tat-Major G\u00e9n\u00e9ral'' (Army General Headquarters). Since the earliest collaboration of Napoleon and Berthier, its organisation was more or less fixed and it would see only slight changes during the later campaigns of the empire.<ref name=McNab44>McNab, p. 44</ref> The Army General Headquarters included the office of the ''Major-G\u00e9n\u00e9ral'''s (Chief of Staff's) Cabinet with their four departments: Movements, Secretariat, Accounting and Intelligence (orders of battle). The ''Major-G\u00e9n\u00e9ral'' also had his own private Military Staff which included duty Generals and Staff aides-de-camp. Finally there was the Army General Staff with the offices of the three Assistant Major-Generals to the ''Major-G\u00e9n\u00e9ral''.\n\n[[File:Louis-Alexandre Berthier.png|thumb|left|Louis-Alexandre Berthier acted as Napoleon's Chief of Staff from 1796 until 1814, after his death being replaced by [[Jean-de-Dieu Soult]] during the [[Hundred Days]].|293x293px]]\nThe role of Chief of Staff in the ''Grande Arm\u00e9e'' became almost synonymous with Berthier, who occupied this position in almost all the major campaigns of Napoleon. The General Headquarters was Berthier's unique domain and the emperor respected this demarcation. Its personnel received orders only from Berthier and even Napoleon did not interfere in its immense tasks; he would never walk in on Berthier's private staff while they were writing and copying the orders that he had just given. Since the emperor was his own \"operations officer\", it can be said that Berthier's job consisted of absorbing Napoleon's strategic intentions, translating them into written orders and transmitting them with the utmost speed and clarity. He also received in the emperor's name the reports of the marshals and commanding generals and when necessary signed them on Napoleon's behalf. Detailed reports on everything that occurred for good or ill were to be sent to Berthier, who would in turn select the most important ones and transmit them to the emperor; nothing was to be concealed from Napoleon.<ref name=McNab44/>\n\nLest one think this was a safe officejob of the modern staff officers, a contemporary subordinate staff officer, Brossier, reports that at the [[Battle of Marengo]]:<blockquote>\n\"The General-in-Chief Berthier gave his orders with the precision of a consummate warrior, and at Marengo maintained the reputation that he so rightly acquired in Italy and in Egypt under the orders of Bonaparte. He himself was hit by a bullet in the arm. Two of his aides-de-camp, Dutaillis and La Borde, had their horses killed.\"<ref>Watson, p. 92</ref></blockquote>\n== Organisation ==\n[[File:Grande-armee en.svg|thumb|Organisation of the ''Grande Arm\u00e9e'' during the [[War of the Third Coalition]]|252x252px]]\nOne of the most important factors in the ''Grande Arm\u00e9e''<nowiki/>'s success was its superior and highly flexible organisation. It was subdivided into several [[corps]] (usually from five to seven), each numbering anywhere between 10,000 and 50,000, with the average size being around 20,000 to 30,000 troops. These ''Corps d'Arm\u00e9e'' were self-contained, smaller armies of [[combined arms]], consisting of elements from all the forces and support services discussed below. While capable of fully independent operations and of defending themselves until reinforced, the corps usually worked in close concert together and kept within a day's marching distance of one another. The corps would often follow separate routes on a wide front and were small enough to live by foraging, allowing fewer supplies to be carried. Through dispersion and the use of forced marches the ''Grande Arm\u00e9e'' was often able to surprise opposing armies by its speed of manoeuver.<ref>{{cite book |title=The Utility of Force |last=Smith |first=Rupert |year=2005 |publisher=Penguin Books |location=London |isbn=978-0-14-102044-0 |pages=[https://archive.org/details/isbn_9780141020440/page/35 35\u201338] |url=https://archive.org/details/isbn_9780141020440/page/35 }}</ref> A Corps, depending on its size and the importance of its mission, was commanded by a marshal or ''G\u00e9n\u00e9ral de Division'' (major general).<ref>Kevin Kiley The Grand Quartier-General Imperial and the Corps d'Arm\u00e9e, Developments in the Military Art, 1795\u20131815, Part II: The Corps d'Arm\u00e9e [http://www.napoleon-series.org/military/organization/c_staff2.html]</ref>\n\nNapoleon placed great trust in his corps commanders and usually allowed them a wide freedom of action, provided they acted within the outlines of his strategic objectives and worked together to accomplish them. When they failed to do this to his satisfaction, however, he would not hesitate to reprimand or relieve them and in many cases took personal command of their corps himself. Corps were first formed in 1800, when General [[Jean Victor Marie Moreau|Moreau]] divided the [[Army of the Rhine]] into four corps. These were only temporary groupings, however, and it was not until 1804 that Napoleon made them permanent units. He would sometimes form the cavalry into separate corps, so they would be able to move and mass more quickly without being slowed by the infantry or foot artillery.{{Citation needed|date=February 2009}}\n\nThe main tactical units of the corps were the [[Division (military)|divisions]], usually consisting of 4,000 to 10,000 infantry or 2,000 to 4,000 cavalrymen. These in turn were made up of two or three [[brigade]]s of two [[regiment]]s apiece and supported by an [[artillery brigade]] of three or four [[Artillery battery|batteries]], each with six field [[cannon]]s and two [[howitzer]]s, making 24 to 32 guns in all. The divisions were also permanent administrative and operational units, commanded by a ''G\u00e9n\u00e9ral de Division'' and likewise capable of independent actions.{{Citation needed|date=February 2009}}\n\n==Forces of the ''Grande Arm\u00e9e''==\n\n===Imperial Guard===\n{{main|Imperial Guard (Napoleon I)}}\n\nThe [[Imperial Guard (Napoleon I)|Imperial Guard]] (''Garde Imp\u00e9riale'') was one of the most elite military forces of its time, and grew out of the ''Garde du Directoire'' and ''Garde Consulaire''.{{Citation needed|date=February 2009}} It formed a single ''Corps d'Arm\u00e9e'' with infantry, cavalry and artillery units like other corps, but with unique identities and uniforms. Napoleon also wanted it to be an example for the entire army to follow, and a force that, since it had fought with him over several campaigns, was completely loyal. Although the infantry was rarely committed en masse, the Guard's cavalry was often thrown into battle as the killing blow and its artillery used to pound enemies prior to assaults.{{Citation needed|date=February 2009}}\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+ Size of the Imperial Guard over time\n|-\n!

During the 1807 campaign in Poland, Napoleon gave the Grenadiers the nickname ''les grognards'' (the grumblers). They were the most experienced and bravest infantrymen in the Guard, some veterans having served in over 20 campaigns. To join the Grenadiers, a recruit had to have served for at least 10 years, have received a citation for bravery, be literate, and be over 178&nbsp;cm tall. The Old Guard were usually held in reserve for crucial moments on the battlefield, and unleashed to act as a hammer blow to a shaken enemy. For example, the ''1er R\u00e9giment de Grenadiers \u00e0 Pied'' saw heavy action at the [[Battle of Eylau]]. By 1815, the Old Guard grenadiers numbered four regiments, the 3e Grenadiers and 4e Grenadiers having been added in 1810 and 1815 respectively. The 2e, 3e and 4e Grenadiers were fully engaged at the Battle of Ligny, but two days later were defeated by the British as they advanced to in an attempt to smash the weakened British line at Waterloo. The two battalions of the 1er Grenadiers formed squares and fended off allied attacks to protect the general retreat. The ''Grenadiers \u00e0 Pied'' wore a dark blue ''habit long'' (coat with long tails) with red turnbacks, epaulettes, and white lapels. The most distinguishing feature of the Grenadiers was the tall [[bearskin]] hat, decorated with an engraved [[gold]] plate, a red [[hackle|plume]], and white cords.\n**'''Imperial Guard Foot ''Chasseurs'' (''Chasseurs \u00e0 Pied de la Garde Imp\u00e9riale'')''':<ref>[http://www.napoleon-series.org/military/organization/frenchguard/chasseurs/c_chasseursapied.html Uniforms of the Chasseurs-\u00e0-Pied de la Garde], Accessed March 16, 2006.</ref> The ''Chasseurs'' of the Guard were the second most senior regiment in the ''Grande Arm\u00e9e''.

The ''Chasseurs'' were in action in several crucial battles. Following Napoleon's return in 1815, the ''Chasseurs'' was expanded to four regiments also, with the 2e, 3e and 4e regiments being formed from recruits with only four years experience. These regiments also formed the assault of the Guard during the final phase of the Battle of Waterloo. The 2nd battalion of the 1st ''Chasseurs'' joined in the main attack of the Middle Guard, but were repulsed, while the second guarded the emperor's headquarters. The ''Chasseurs \u00e0 Pied'' wore a dark blue ''habit long'' with red turnbacks, red epaulettes fringed green, and white lapels. On campaign, the ''Chasseurs'' often wore dark blue trousers. As with the Grenadiers, the ''Chasseurs'' most distinguishing feature was the tall bearskin, decorated with a red over green plume and white cords.\n* '''Middle Guard (''Moyenne Garde'')''':<ref>[http://web2.airmail.net/napoleon/IMPERIAL_GUARD_infantry_1.htm#frenchthemiddleguard Napoleon's Guard Infantry \u2013 Moyenne Garde] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080214204625/http://web2.airmail.net/napoleon/IMPERIAL_GUARD_infantry_1.htm#frenchthemiddleguard |date=2008-02-14 }}, Accessed March 16, 2006.</ref> Consisted of veteran soldiers of at least 3 campaigns.\n**'''Fusiliers-''Chasseurs''''': In 1806, the Fusiliers-''Chasseurs'' was formed as a regiment of the Middle Guard infantry. All members of the Middle Guard were veterans of 2\u20133 campaigns and were commissioned as NCOs in the line regiments. Arguably the best infantry of the entire Guard, the Fusiliers-''Chasseurs'' most often operated together with its sister formation, the Fusiliers-Grenadiers, as part of a Guard Fusilier-Brigade. The Fusilier-''Chasseurs'' saw extensive action, proving their worth time and time again, until they were disbanded in 1814 following Napoleon's abdication.

The battalion was formed with five ''\u00e9quipages'' (or crews), companies in all but name. After the cancellation of the invasion, the Marines remained a part of the Guard, manning whatever boat, [[barge]] or other water vessel Napoleon traveled in, as well as acting as a combat unit.

Later its ranks would be filled almost entirely by select conscripts and volunteers.\n**'''''Tirailleurs''-Grenadiers''': In 1808, Napoleon ordered the most intelligent and strongest recruits to be formed into the first regiments of the Young Guard. The tallest of the recruits were inducted into the Tirailleurs-Grenadier regiments (renamed to Tirailleurs in 1810). All officers of the Tirailleurs-Grenadiers were drawn from the Old Guard, and as such were entitled to wear bearskins. The NCOs were drawn from the Middle Guard. Having this leavening of hardened veterans helped to increase the morale and combat abilities of the Tirailleurs-Grenadiers, and its sister formations the ''Tirailleurs-Chasseurs''. ''Tirailleurs''-Grenadiers wore a dark blue ''habit'' with red epaulettes, dark blue turnbacks, and lapels piped white. The Tirailleurs-Grenadiers' shako had red cords with a long red plume.\n** '''''Tirailleurs-Chasseurs''''': The shorter recruits of the Young Guard were inducted into the ''Tirailleurs-Chasseurs'' (renamed to ''Voltigeurs'' in 1810). The formation was identical to that of the ''Tirailleurs''-Grenadiers, with all officers being drawn from the Old Guard, and NCOs coming from the Middle Guard. ''Tirailleurs''-Grenadiers wore a dark blue ''habit'' with red turnbacks and dark blue lapels piped white. This was further decorated by green epaulettes with red fringing.

With Napoleon's first abdication, an ensign and 21 marines accompanied him to Elba, and returned with him for the Hundred Days campaign when their strength was increased to an ''equipage'' of 150 officers and men.\n\nThe marines were distinct in several ways from other ''Grande Arm\u00e9e'' units in that naval rather than army ranks were used, the uniform was based on that of those of the [[hussar]]s, and it was the only unit of the ''Grande Arm\u00e9e'' in which the musicians used both the [[drum]]s and the [[trumpet]]s.<ref>Head, Michael G. ''Foot Regiments of the Imperial Guard'', p. 10.

Combined with sailor battalions, these fought as part of the ''Division de Marine'' at the battles of L\u00fctzen, Bautzen, Dresden, and won high praise at the Battle of Leipzig. The Marine Guard units were disbanded in 1815.\n\n====Cavalry of the Guard====\nIn 1804, the [[Cavalry]] of the Guard consisted of two regiments, the ''Chasseurs \u00e0 Cheval'' and the ''Grenadiers \u00e0 Cheval'', along with a small unit of elite ''[[Gendarme (historical)|Gendarmes]]'' and a [[Squadron (army)|squadron]] of [[Mamelukes]]. A third regiment was added in 1806, the ''Regiment de Dragons de la Garde Imp\u00e9riale'' (Later known as the ''Dragons de l'Imperatice'', the Empress Dragoons). Following the campaign in Poland in 1807, a regiment of Polish [[lancer]]s, the ''Regiment de Chevau-L\u00e9gers de la Garde Imp\u00e9riale Polonais'' was added. The final addition was made in 1810, with another regiment of lancers, this time drawn from French and Dutch recruits, the ''2e Regiment de Chevau-L\u00e9gers Lanciers de la Garde Imp\u00e9riale'' or Red Lancers. The Cavalry of the Guard was involved in combat numerous times, and with few exceptions proved its worth in action.\n* '''[[Grenadiers \u00e0 Cheval de la Garde Imp\u00e9riale|Imperial Guard Horse Grenadiers (''Grenadiers \u00e0 Cheval de la Garde Imp\u00e9riale'')]]''': Known as the ''Gods'' or the ''Giants'', these troopers were the elite of Napoleon's Guard Cavalry and the mounted counterparts of the ''Grognards''. The Horse Grenadiers wore tall bearskin caps, dark blue coats and collars, white lapels, and tall boots. The entire formation was mounted on large black horses. A prospective recruit had to be over 176&nbsp;cm tall, have accrued 10 years of service serving in a minimum of four campaigns, and have received a citation for bravery. The Grenadiers performed admirably at Austerlitz, where they defeated the Russian Guard cavalry, but their most famous combat was at the Battle of Eylau. After standing under the fire of sixty Russian guns for a time, the troopers began to search for cover. Their commander, Colonel [[Louis Lepic]], ordered the troops, ''\"Up with your heads gentlemen, those are only bullets, not turds\"''.<ref>[http://www.napoleon-series.org/military/organization/c_eylau.html#4 \"Heads Up, By God!\" French Cavalry At Eylau, 1807 And Napoleon's Cavalry Doctrine], Accessed March 16, 2006.</ref> Soon after they joined Marshal Murat's charge into the Russian lines.

In 1796, during the Italian campaign, Napoleon ordered the formation of a bodyguard unit after he narrowly escaped an attack by Austrian light cavalry at [[Battle of Borghetto|Borghetto]] while at lunch.<ref>[http://www.napoleon-series.org/military/organization/frenchguard/c_guides1796.html By Order of the Commander-in-Chief: the Origin of the Guides-\u00e0-cheval], Accessed March 16, 2006.</ref> This 200-man unit of Guides was the forerunner of the ''Chasseurs \u00e0 Cheval'' of the Guard, and their close affiliation with the emperor was shown by the fact that he often wore the uniform of a colonel of their regiment. In their flamboyant green, red, and gold hussar style uniforms, the ''Chasseurs'' were known to exploit their position as the emperor's favourites, showing poor discipline and even insubordination on some occasions. They first saw combat during the Battle of Austerlitz, where they played a role in defeating the Russian Guard cavalry. During the Peninsular War, the ''Chasseurs'' were ambushed by a large British cavalry force at [[Benavente, Zamora|Benavente]] in 1808 and were defeated. They regained their reputation by showing extreme bravery during the Battle of Waterloo.{{Citation needed|date=February 2009}}\n* '''[[Gendarmes d'\u00e9lite de la Garde Imp\u00e9riale|Elite Gendarmes]] (''Gendarmerie d'Elite'')''': Nicknamed the ''Immortals'' because they rarely saw combat, the ''Gendarmes'' nonetheless performed a vital role. ''Gendarmes'' were the [[military police]] of the ''Grande Arm\u00e9e''. Along with maintaining security and order near the headquarters, the ''Gendarmes'' would provide honour guards for high-ranking visitors, interrogate prisoners, and protect the emperor's personal baggage. The ''Gendarmes'' wore dark blue coats with red lapels and tall boots, along with a bearskin cap slightly smaller than that of the Horse Grenadiers. After 1807, the ''Gendarmes'' began to see more combat, distinguishing themselves in guarding the Danube bridges at Aspern-Essling in 1809.{{Citation needed|date=February 2009}}\n* '''[[Squadron of Mamelukes]] (''Escadron de Mamelouks'')''': Fearsome desert warriors, whose loyalty Napoleon purchased during his Egyptian campaign. They combined superb horsemanship and swordsmanship with fanatical courage. Often romantically viewed as \"authentic sons of the desert\" or even \"head-hunters\", their officers were French, the NCOs and ranks comprising not only Egyptians and Turks, but also Greeks, Georgians, Syrians, and Cypriots as well, and even many of them were French. Originally they were an attached company (or \"Half-Squadron\") of the ''Chasseurs-a-Cheval de la Garde''. They distinguished themselves at Austerlitz in 1805, winning their own standard, a second trumpeter and promotion to full squadron. This unit eventually became part of the Old Guard, and served the emperor right up to Waterloo. In 1813, a second Mameluke company was raised and attached to the Young Guard. As with their predecessors, they were incorporated into the ''Chasseurs'', and served alongside them during the Hundred Days in 1815. By this time, the personnel being almost exclusively Frenchmen. Their distinct and colourful uniforms consisted of a green (later red) ''cahouk'' (hat), white turban, a loose shirt and a vest and red ''[[saroual]]'' (baggy trousers), with yellow, red, or tan boots. Their weapons consisted of a long, curved [[Scimitar]], a brace of pistols, and a dagger. Their hats and weapons were inscribed with a crescent and star insignia of brass.{{Citation needed|date=February 2009}}\n* '''[[Lancers of the Guard]] (''Chevau-L\u00e9gers-Lanciers de la Garde Imp\u00e9riale'')''':<ref>[http://www.napoleon-series.org/military/organization/frenchguard/c_polishlancers1.html Napoleon's Polish Lancers], Accessed March 16, 2006.</ref>\n**'''[[1st Polish Light Cavalry Regiment of the Imperial Guard|1st Light Horse Regiment (Polish)]]''': In 1807 Napoleon authorized the raising of a guard regiment of Polish light cavalry. They were to be given French instructors and training. But during their first review before the emperor, their ranks became so entangled that Napoleon quipped, ''\"These people only know how to fight!\"'' and dismissed their instructors on the spot. But he kept his Polish cavalrymen by his side and the following year at [[Battle of Somosierra|Somosierra]] they would have another opportunity to prove themselves, on the battlefield instead of the parade ground. Napoleon ordered them to charge against a heavily fortified Spanish artillery position. Armed with only sabres and pistols, they overran four batteries, capturing over 20 cannons and decisively turned the tide. Following this, almost legendary, feat Napoleon proclaimed \"Poles, You are worthy of my Old Guard I proclaim you my bravest cavalry!\". Promoted to the Old Guard, they were then given lances, remained at the Emperor's side until Waterloo, and were never defeated by enemy cavalry. The 1e Regiment of the Guard developed a rivalry with their fellow Poles of the 1e Vistula Uhlans. This was not simply based on who was the better unit, but on deep political differences as well, with the lancers being fanatical Bonapartists, while many, if not most, of the uhlans held fiercely Republican sentiments. Such differences, political and otherwise, between units were not unusual and are well illustrated here. From being instructed by the French, they, along with their Vistula rivals, would go on to serve as instructors and models for the French and most other lancer regiments of the ''Grande Arm\u00e9e'', thus greatly multiplying their fearsome effectiveness.{{Citation needed|date=February 2009}}[[File:LancierRouge.jpg|right|thumb|A Red Lancer]]\n** '''[[2e r\u00e9giment de chevau-l\u00e9gers lanciers de la Garde Imp\u00e9riale|2nd Light Horse Regiment (French-Dutch)]]''': Formed in 1810 from a French and Dutch cadre. They were called ''Les Lanciers Rouges'' (the Red Lancers) due to their distinctive uniforms. They too suffered heavily in Russia at the hands of the Cossacks and the hardships of the winter, with most of its men and all but a handful of the horses lost. The regiment was rebuilt in 1813 and it became a powerful unit with its first four squadrons of veterans in the Old Guard and the new recruits of 6 junior squadrons in the Young Guard. They would distinguish themselves in numerous engagements, including Waterloo.\n** '''3rd Light Horse Regiment (Polish)''': Formed in 1812 as part of the Young Guard, its officers and NCOs were veterans, but its ranks were filled by enthusiastic yet inexperienced students and sons of Polish and Lithuanian landholders. With little training, they were thrown into the Russian campaign where they were surrounded and the entire regiment wiped out at [[Slonim]] later that year by Cossacks and hussars.\n* '''[[Dragons de la Garde Imp\u00e9riale|Empress Dragoons]] (''Dragons de l'Imp\u00e9ratice'')''': Formed in 1806 as the Imperial Guard Dragoon Regiment (''Regiment de Dragons de la Garde Imp\u00e9riale''), it was renamed in honor of [[Empress Jos\u00e9phine]] the following year. Originally, candidates had to have at least 6 (later 10) years of service, participated in no fewer than 2 campaigns with citations for bravery, be literate, and at least 173&nbsp;cm tall (slightly shorter than for the Horse Grenadier Guards). No more than 12 candidates from each of the 30 regular dragoon regiments were allowed to apply at any one call, this quota would later be reduced to 10. Volunteers from other guard regiments were also allowed to transfer. Since this was as much a ceremonial as a combat unit and was rarely committed in battle, billets in the Empress Dragoons were highly sought after positions. As with the Red Lancers, it had squadrons in both the Old and Young Guards and served with the emperor until the end.\n* '''[[Scouts of the Imperial Guard]] (''Eclaireurs de la Garde Imp\u00e9riale'')''': During the retreat from Moscow, Napoleon was highly impressed by the skills of many regiments of Cossacks. He used them as a model to create a new cavalry brigade, the Scouts, which were formed during the reorganisation of the Imperial Guard in December 1813. 3 regiments of a thousand men each were created and their squadrons attached to existing regiments:\n**'''1st Regiment''': ''scouts-grenadiers'' under Colonel-Major [[Claude Testot-Ferry]]'s command (wounded and titled Baron of the Empire by Napoleon himself on the battlefield of [[Battle of Craonne|Craonne]] on 7 March 1814)\n** '''2nd Regiment''': ''scouts-dragoons'' under Colonel Hoffmayer's command\n** '''3rd Regiment''': ''scouts-lanciers'' under Jean Kozietulski's command\nThe scouts had only the time to distinguish themselves during the defence of France in 1814 and were dissolved by King Louis XVIII upon the restoration of the Bourbon monarchy.\n\n===Infantry===\nWhile the [[infantry]] was perhaps not the most glamorous arm of service in the Grand Arm\u00e9e, they bore the brunt of most of the fighting, and their performance resulted in victory or defeat. The infantry was divided up into two major types, the Infantry of the Line (''Infanterie de Ligne'') and the Light Infantry (''Infanterie L\u00e9g\u00e8re'').\n\n====Line Infantry====\nThe [[line infantry]] made up the majority of the ''Grande Arm\u00e9e''. In 1803, Napoleon had reinstated the term \"regiment\", the revolutionary term \"[[demi-brigade]]\" (due to the fact there were two per brigade and it lacked the royal connotations) was now only used for provisional troops and depot units. At the time of the formation of the ''Grande Arm\u00e9e'', the French Army had 133 ''R\u00e9giments de Ligne'', a number which roughly corresponded with the number of ''[[Departments of France|d\u00e9partements]]'' in France. There would eventually be 156 ''Ligne'' regiments\n\nThe ''R\u00e9giments de Ligne'' varied in size throughout the Napoleonic Wars, but the basic building block of the ''Infanterie of the Line'' was the [[battalion]]. A line infantry battalion was numbered at about 840 men; however, this was the battalion's 'full strength' and few units ever reached this. A more typical strength for a battalion would be 400\u2013600 men. From 1800 to 1803, a line infantry battalion had eight fusilier companies and one grenadier company. From 1804 to 1807, a line infantry battalion had seven fusilier companies, one grenadier company, and one ''voltigeur'' company. From 1808 to 1815, a line infantry battalion had four companies of fusiliers, one company of grenadiers, and one company of ''voltigeurs''.

Newly formed battalions did not have a grenadier company; rather, Napoleon ordered that after two campaigns, several of the strongest, bravest, and tallest fusiliers were to be promoted to a grenadier company, so each line battalion which had seen more than two campaigns had one company of grenadiers.\n\nRegulations required that grenadier recruits were to be the tallest, most fearsome men in the regiments, and all were to have [[moustache]]s. To add to this, grenadiers were initially equipped with a ''bonnet \u00e0 poil'' or bearskin, as well as red [[epaulette]]s on their coat. After 1807, regulations stipulated that line grenadiers were to replace their bearskin with a shako lined red with a red plume; however, many chose to retain their bearskins. In addition to the standard Charleville model 1777 and bayonet, grenadiers were also equipped with a short [[sabre]]. This was to be used for close combat, but most often ended up serving as a tool to cut wood for campfires.\n\nA grenadier company would usually be situated on the right side of a formation, traditionally the place of greatest honour since the days of [[hoplite]] warfare in which a corps' right flank had less protection from the shield line of its formation. During a campaign, grenadier companies could be detached to form a grenadier battalion or occasionally a regiment or brigade. These formations would then be used as a shock force or the [[Vanguard (military formation)|vanguard]] for a larger formation.\n\n=====[[Voltigeur|''Voltigeurs'']] of the Line=====\n''Voltigeurs'' (literally, ''Vaulters'' or ''Leapers'') were elite light infantry of the line regiments. In 1805, Napoleon ordered that the smallest, most agile men of the line battalions be chosen to form a ''voltigeur'' company. These troops were to be second only to the grenadiers in the battalion hierarchy. Their name comes from their original mission. ''Voltigeurs'' were to vault upon horses of friendly cavalry for faster movement, an idea which proved impractical if not outright impossible. Despite this, the ''voltigeurs'' did perform a valuable task, [[skirmish]]ing and providing scouts for each battalion, as well as providing an organic light infantry component for each line regiment. In ''voltigeur'' training, emphasis was placed on marksmanship and quick movement.\n\n''Voltigeurs'' were equipped with large yellow and green or yellow and red plumes for their bicornes. After 1807, their shakos were lined with yellow and carried similar plumes. They also had yellow epaulettes lined green and a yellow collar on their coats.\n\nOriginally, ''voltigeurs'' were to be equipped with the short dragoon musket, however in practice, they were equipped with the Charleville model 1777 and bayonet. Like grenadiers, ''voltigeurs'' were equipped with a short sabre for close combat, and like grenadiers this was rarely used. ''Voltigeur'' companies could be detached and formed into regiments or brigades to create a light infantry formation. After 1808, the ''voltigeur'' company was situated on the left of the line when in combat. This was traditionally the second highest position of honour in the line of battle.\n\n===== [[Fusilier]]s =====\n[[File:LineInfantry1812.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Fusiliers of the line, {{circa|1812}}]]\n\nThe fusiliers made up the majority of a line infantry battalion, and may be considered the typical infantryman of the ''Grande Arm\u00e9e''. Fusiliers were armed with a [[smoothbore]], [[muzzle (firearms)|muzzle]]-loaded [[flintlock]] Charleville model 1777 musket and a bayonet. Fusilier training placed emphasis on speed of march and endurance, along with individually aimed fire at close range and close quarters combat. This differed greatly from the training given to the majority of European armies, which emphasised moving in rigid formations and firing massed volleys. Many of the early Napoleonic victories were due to the ability of the French armies to cover long distances with speed, and this ability was thanks to the training given to the infantry. From 1803, each battalion comprised eight fusilier companies. Each company numbered around 120 men.\n\nIn 1805, one of the fusilier companies was dissolved and reformed as a ''voltigeur'' company. In 1808, Napoleon reorganised the infantry battalion from nine to six companies. The new companies were to be larger, comprising 140 men, and four of these were to be made up of fusiliers, one of grenadiers, and one of ''voltigeurs''.\n\nThe fusiliers wore a bicorne, until this was superseded by the shako in 1807. The uniform of a fusilier consisted of white trousers, white surcoat and a dark blue coat (the ''habit long'' model until 1812, thereafter the ''habit veste'') with white lapels, red collar and cuffs. Each eusilier wore a coloured [[pom-pom]] on his hat. The colour of this pom-pom changed depending on the company the man belonged to, as military uniforms reached their excessive pinnacle at around this period in time. After the 1808 reorganisation, the first company was issued with a dark green pom-pom, the second with sky blue, the third with orange and the fourth with violet.\n\n====Light Infantry====\nWhile the infantry of the line made up the majority of the ''Grande Arm\u00e9e''<nowiki/>'s infantry, the ''Infanterie L\u00e9g\u00e8re'' ([[Light Infantry]]) also played an important role. The ''L\u00e9g\u00e8re'' regiments never numbered more than 36 (compared with the 133 of the ''Ligne'' regiments), and the ''Ligne'' could perform all the same manoeuvres, including skirmishes. The difference laid in the training and the resulting high ''[[esprit de corps]]''.\n\nTraining for ''L\u00e9g\u00e8re'' units placed strong emphasis on marksmanship and fast movement. As a result, the general ''L\u00e9g\u00e8re'' soldier was able to shoot more accurately and move faster than his ''Ligne'' counterpart. ''L\u00e9g\u00e8re'' regiments tended to see more action and were often used to screen large manoeuvres. Naturally, because commanders turned to the ''L\u00e9g\u00e8re'' for more missions than the ''Ligne'', the ''L\u00e9g\u00e8re'' troopers enjoyed a higher esprit de corps and were known for their flamboyant uniforms and attitude. Also, ''L\u00e9g\u00e8re'' troops were required to be shorter than line troops, which helped them to move quickly through forests as well as to hide behind obstacles when skirmishing. The formation of a ''L\u00e9g\u00e8re'' battalion exactly mirrored that of a line infantry battalion, but different troop types were substituted for the grenadiers, fusiliers and ''voltigeurs''.\n\n===== ''Carabiniers-\u00e0-Pied'' =====\nThe carabiniers were the grenadiers of the ''L\u00e9g\u00e8re'' battalions. After two campaigns, the tallest and bravest ''chasseurs'' were chosen to join a carabinier company. They performed as elite shock troops for the battalion. As with the grenadiers, carabiniers were required to wear moustaches. They were armed with the Charleville model 1777, a bayonet, and a short sabre. The carabinier uniform consisted of a tall bearskin cap (superseded in 1807 by a red trimmed shako with a red plume). They wore the same uniform as the ''chasseurs'', but with red epaulettes. Carabinier companies could be detached to form larger all carabinier formations for assaults or other operations requiring assault troops.\n\n===== Light ''Voltigeurs''=====\n''Voltigeurs'' performed exactly the same mission in the ''L\u00e9g\u00e8re'' battalion as they did in the line battalions, only they were more nimble and better marksmen. The ''L\u00e9g\u00e8re'' ''voltigeurs'' were dressed as ''chasseurs'', but with yellow and green epaulettes and before 1806, a ''colpack'' (or [[Busby (military headdress)|busby]]) replaced the shako. The colpack had a large yellow over red plume and green cords. After 1807, a shako replaced the colpack, with a large yellow plume and yellow lining. As with the line ''voltigeurs'', ''l\u00e9g\u00e8re'' ''voltigeurs'' could be detached and used to form larger formations as needed.\n\n=====[[Chasseur|''Chasseurs'']]=====\n''Chasseurs'' (''Hunters'') were the fusiliers of the ''L\u00e9g\u00e8re'' battalions. They made up the majority of the formation. They were armed with the Charleville model 1777 musket and a bayonet, and also with a short sabre for close combat. As was common in the ''Grande Arm\u00e9e'', this weapon was quickly blunted by being used to chop wood for fires.\n\nFrom 1803, each battalion comprising eight ''chasseur'' companies. Each company numbered around 120 men. In 1808, Napoleon reorganised the infantry battalion from nine to six companies. The new companies were to be larger, comprising 140 men, and four of these were to be made up of ''chasseurs''.\n\nThe ''chasseurs'' had far more ornate uniforms than their contemporaries the fusiliers. Until 1806, they were equipped with a cylindrical shako with a large dark green plume and decorated with white cords. Their uniform was a darker blue than that of the line regiments, to aid with camouflage while skirmishing. Their coat was similar to that of the line troops, but their lapels and cuffs were also dark blue, and it featured dark green and red epaulettes. They also wore dark blue trousers and high imitation hussar boots. After 1807, the cylindrical shako was replaced with the standard shako, but was still embellished by white cords. As with the line fusiliers, ''chasseur'' companies were distinguished by coloured pom-poms, but the colours for the different companies changed from regiment to regiment.\n\n<gallery class=\"center\" mode=\"packed\" heights=\"200\">\nFile:Grenadier1812.jpg|A grenadier of the line, {{circa|1812}}\nFile:Lightinfnap.jpg|Officers of ''Infanterie L\u00e9g\u00e8re'', 1803\u20131815\nFile:Legere-Chasseur.jpg|''Chasseurs'' of ''Infanterie L\u00e9g\u00e8re'', 1806 \n</gallery>\n\n===Cavalry===\nBy decree of the emperor himself, cavalry typically were between a fifth and a sixth of the ''Grande Arm\u00e9e''. Cavalry regiments of 800\u20131,200 men were made up of three or four escadrons of two companies each, plus supporting elements. In [[light cavalry]] and dragoon regiments, the first company of every regiment's first escadron, was always designated as 'elite', with presumably, the best men and horses. In the revolution's wake, the cavalry suffered the greatest from the loss of experienced aristocratic officers and NCOs still loyal to the ''[[Ancien R\u00e9gime]]''. Consequently, the quality of French cavalry drastically declined. Napoleon rebuilt the branch, turning it into arguably the finest in the world. Until 1812, it was undefeated in any large engagements above the regimental level. There were two primary types of cavalry for different roles, [[Heavy cavalry|heavy]] and light.\n[[File:Bataille Waterloo 1815 reconstitution 2011 2.jpg|thumb|upright=3|center|Sample of the cavalry of the ''Grande Arm\u00e9e'' during a [[Historical reenactment|reenactment]] of the [[Battle of Waterloo]]]]\n\n====Heavy cavalry====\n\n===== ''[[Carabiniers-\u00e0-Cheval]]'' (Horse Carabiners) =====\nThe elite among all French heavy cavalry line formations, the two regiments of mounted carabiniers had a very similar appearance with the mounted grenadiers of the Imperial Guard; bearskins, long blue coats, etc. and were mounted exclusively on black horses prior to 1813. They were largely used in identical manner to the Cuirassiers, but being (initially) unarmored, they were less suited for close-quarters, [[melee]] combat. Unarmored heavy cavalry was the norm in Europe during most of the Napoleonic Wars, with the French being the first to reintroduce the back-and-breastplate. In 1809, appalled by their mauling at the hands of Austrian uhlans, Napoleon ordered that they be given armour. The carabinier's refusal to copy the less elite cuirassiers resulted in them being given special armor, with their helmets and cuirasses being sheathed in bronze for added visual effect. But this did not prevent them from being defeated by Russian cuirassiers at Borodino in 1812, and panicking before Hungarian hussars at Leipzig the following year.\n\n===== [[Cuirassier]]s =====\nThe heavy cavalry, wearing a heavy ''[[cuirass]]'' (breastplate) and helmets of brass and iron and armed with straight long sabers, pistols, and later [[carbine]]s. Like medieval knights, they served as mounted [[shock troops]]. Because of the weight of their armour and weapons, both the trooper and the horse had to be big and strong, and could put a lot of force behind their charge. Though the ''cuirass'' could not protect against direct musket fire, it could deflect ricochets and shots from long range, and offered some protection from pistol shots. More importantly, the breastplates protected against the swords and lances of opposing cavalry. Napoleon often combined together all of his cuirassiers and carabiniers into a cavalry reserve, to be used at the decisive moment of the battle. In this manner, they proved to be an extremely potent force on the battlefield. The British, in particular, who mistakenly believed the cuirassiers were Napoleon's bodyguard, and would later come to adapt their distinctive helmets and breastplates for their own [[Household Cavalry]]. There were originally 25 cuirassier regiments, reduced to 12 by Napoleon initially who later added three more. At the beginning of his rule, most of the cuirassier regiments were severely understrength, so Napoleon ordered the best men and horses to be allocated to the first 12 regiments, while the rest were reorganised into dragoons.\n\n===== [[Dragoon]]s =====\nThe medium-weight mainstays of the French cavalry, although considered heavy cavalry, who were used for battle, skirmishing, and scouting. They were highly versatile being armed not only with distinctive straight swords, but also muskets with bayonets enabling them to fight as infantry as well as mounted, though fighting on foot had become increasingly uncommon for dragoons of all armies in the decades preceding Napoleon. The versatility of a dual-purpose soldier came at the cost of their horsemanship and swordsmanship often not being up to the same standards as those of other cavalry. Finding enough large horses proved a challenge. Some infantry officers were even required to give up their mounts for the dragoons, creating resentment towards them from this branch as well. There were 25, later 30, dragoon regiments. In 1815, only 15 could be raised and mounted in time for the Waterloo campaign.\n\n====Light cavalry====\n\n===== [[Hussar|Hussars]] =====\nThese fast, light cavalrymen were the eyes, ears, and egos of the Napoleonic armies. They regarded themselves as the best horsemen and swordsmen (''beau sabreurs'') in the entire ''Grande Arm\u00e9e''. This opinion was not entirely unjustified and their flamboyant uniforms reflected their panache. Tactically, they were used for [[reconnaissance]], skirmishing, and screening for the army to keep their commanders informed of enemy movements while denying the enemy the same information and to pursue fleeing enemy troops. Armed only with curved sabres and pistols, they had reputations for reckless bravery to the point of being almost suicidal. It was said by their most famous commander [[Antoine Lasalle]] that a hussar who lived to be 30 was truly an old guard and very fortunate. Lasalle was killed at the Battle of Wagram at age 34. There were 10 regiments in 1804, with an 11th added in 1810 and two more in 1813.\n\n===== ''Chasseurs-\u00e0-Cheval'' (Mounted Hunters) =====\nThese were light cavalry identical to hussars in arms and role. But, unlike the ''chasseurs'' of the Imperial Guard and their infantry counterparts, they were considered less prestigious or elite. Their uniforms were less colourful as well, consisting of infantry-style shakos (in contrast to the fur busby worn by some French hussars), green coats, green breeches, and short boots. They were, however, the most numerous of the light cavalry, with 31 regiments in 1811, 6 of which comprised Flemish, Swiss, Italians and Germans.\n\n===== [[Lancer]]s =====\nSome of the most feared cavalry in the ''Grande Arm\u00e9e'' were the Polish lancers of the Vistula Uhlans. Nicknamed ''Hell's Picadors'' or ''Los Diablos Polacos'' (The Polish Devils) by the Spanish, these medium and light horse (''[[Chevau-l\u00e9gers|Chevau-L\u00e9gers]] Lanciers'') cavalry had near equal speed to the hussars, shock power almost as great as the cuirassiers, and were nearly as versatile as the dragoons. They were armed with, as their name indicates, lances along with sabres and pistols. Initially, French ministers of war insisted on arming all lancers identically. Real battlefield experience, however, proved that the Polish way of arming only the first line with lance while the second rank carried carbines instead was much more practical and thus was adopted. Lancers were the best cavalry for charging against infantry squares, where their lances could outreach the infantry's bayonets, (as was the case with Colborne's British brigade at [[Battle of Albuera#Destruction of Colborne's brigade|Albuera]] in 1811) and also in hunting down a routed enemy. Their ability to scour and finish off the wounded without ever stepping off their saddle created perfect scenes of horror for the enemy. They could be deadly against other types of cavalry as well, most famously demonstrated by the fate of [[William Ponsonby (British Army officer)|Sir William Ponsonby]] and his [[Royal Scots Greys#Waterloo|Scots Greys]] at Waterloo. Excluding those of the Guard, there were 9 lancer regiments.\n\n<gallery class=\"center\" mode=\"packed\" heights=\"180px\">\nImage:Napoleon Carabiner of 1812 by Bellange.jpg|A ''[[Carabiniers-\u00e0-Cheval]]''\nImage:Dragoon of the 21\u00e9r Regiment de Dragons.jpg|A dragoon officer of the ''21\u00e8me R\u00e9giment de Dragons''\nFile:Edouard Detaille - Vive L'Empereur - Google Art Project.jpg|[[4th Hussar Regiment (France)|French 4th Hussars]] at the [[Battle of Friedland]]\nImage:Lancer.jpg|A lancer of the ''R\u00e9giment de la Vistule Uhlans''\n</gallery>\n\n=== Artillery ===\nThe emperor was a former [[artillery]] officer, and reportedly said ''\"God fights on the side with the best artillery.\"''<ref name=artillery>Mas, M.A. M., p. 81.</ref> As such, French cannons were the backbone of the ''Grande Arm\u00e9e'', possessing the greatest firepower of the three arms and hence the ability to inflict the most casualties in the least amount of time. The French guns were often used in massed batteries (or [[Grand Battery|''grandes batteries'']]) to soften up enemy formations before being subjected to the closer attention of the infantry or cavalry. Superb gun-crew training allowed Napoleon to move the weapons at great speed to either bolster a weakening defensive position, or else hammer a potential break in enemy lines.\n\nBesides superior training, Napoleon's artillery was also greatly aided by the numerous technical improvements to French cannons by [[Jean-Baptiste Vaquette de Gribeauval|Jean Baptiste de Gribeauval]] which made them lighter, faster, and much easier to sight, as well as strengthened the carriages and introduced standard sized calibres. In general, French guns were 4-[[pound (mass)|pounders]], 8-pounders, or 12-pounders and {{convert|6|in|mm|adj=on}} [[howitzers]] with the lighter calibres being phased out and replaced by 6-pounders later in the Napoleonic Wars. French cannons had brass barrels and their carriages, wheels, and limbers were painted olive-green. Superb organisation fully integrated the artillery into the infantry and cavalry units it supported, yet also allowed it to operate independently if the need arose. There were two basic types, ''Artillerie \u00e0 pied'' (foot artillery) and ''Artillerie \u00e0 cheval'' (horse artillery).\n\n====Foot artillery====\nAs the name indicates, these gunners marched alongside their guns, which were, of course, pulled by horses when limbered (undeployed). Hence, they travelled at the infantry's pace or slower. In 1805, there were eight, later ten, regiments of foot artillery in the ''Grande Arm\u00e9e'' plus two more in the Imperial Guard, but unlike cavalry and infantry regiments, these were administrative organisations. The main operational and tactical units were the batteries (or companies) of 120 men each, which were formed into brigades and assigned to the divisions and corps.\n* Divisional artillery: Every division had a brigade of three or four batteries of 8 guns (six cannons and two howitzers) each.\n* Corps artillery reserve: Each corps would also have its own artillery reserve, of one of more brigades, armed mostly with the larger, heavier calibre pieces.\n\nBattery personnel included not only gun crews, NCOs, and officers, but drummers, trumpeters, metal workers, woodworkers, ouvriers, furriers, and artificers. They would be responsible for fashioning spare parts, maintaining and repairing the guns, carriages, caissons and wagons, as well as tending the horses and storing munitions.\n\n====Horse artillery====\n[[File:Detaille - Artillerie \u00e0 cheval de la Garde Imperiale.jpg|thumb|upright|A gunner from the horse artillery of the Imperial Guard]]\nThe cavalry were supported by the fast moving, fast firing light guns of the horse artillery. This arm was a hybrid of cavalry and artillery with their crews riding either on the horses or on the carriages into battle. Because they operated much closer to the front lines, the officers and crews were better armed and trained for close quarters combat, mounted or dismounted much as were the dragoons. Once in position, they were trained to quickly dismount, unlimber (deploy), and sight their guns, then fire rapid barrages at the enemy. They could then quickly limber (undeploy) the guns, remount, and move on to a new position. To accomplish this, they had to be the best trained and most elite of all artillerymen. The horse batteries of the Imperial Guard could go from riding at full gallop to firing their first shot in just under a minute. After witnessing such a performance, an astounded [[Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington|Duke of Wellington]] remarked, ''\"They move their cannon as if it were a pistol!\"'' There were 6 administrative regiments of horse artillery plus one in the Guard. In addition to the batteries assigned to the cavalry units, Napoleon would also assign at least one battery to each infantry corps or, if available, to each division. Their abilities came at a price, however, as horse batteries were very expensive to raise and maintain. Consequently, they were far fewer in number than their foot counterparts, typically constituting only one fifth of the artillery's strength. It was a boastful joke among their ranks that the emperor knew every horse gunner by name. Besides better training, horses, weapons, and equipment, they used far more ammunition. Horse batteries were given twice the ammo ration of the foot, three times that of the Guard.\n\n====Ammunition====\nOf all the types of ammunition used in the Napoleonic Wars, the cast iron, spherical, [[round shot]] was the staple of the gunner. Even at long range when the shot was travelling relatively slowly it could be deadly, though it might appear to be bouncing or rolling along the ground relatively gently. At short range, carnage could result.<ref name=\"McNab145\">McNab, p. 145.</ref>\n\nRound shots were undeniably inaccurate. This was because, despite their name, round shots were never perfectly spherical, nor did they fit their gun barrels exactly. Air acted on the irregular surface of the projectile. These irregularities invariably threw them off target to some degree. It is often also a matter of confusion as to why a 12pdr shot was so much more effective than a 6pdr shot. This is because the impact of a shot was not only related to its weight but also to its [[velocity]], which, with a heavier projectile, was much greater at the end of the trajectory.<ref name=\"McNab145\"/>\n\nThere were two forms of close-range weapons, which were extremely useful at up to 270m (300 yards). [[Grapeshot]] and [[Canister shot|canister]], or case, were the anti-personnel weapons of choice of the gunner. Grape was a cluster of large metal spheres tied together around a central spindle and base and normally sewn into a bag, whereas canister was a metal case filled with smaller iron or lead spheres. The whole purpose of these types of shot was to break up when fired from the gun forming a wide cone of flying metal that acted in the same way as a [[shotgun]] [[Cartridge (firearms)|cartridge]].<ref>McNab, p. 145\u201346.</ref>\n\nFor longer-range anti-personnel work, the common [[Shell (projectile)|shell]] was also used. This was normally only fired from a [[Mortar (weapon)|mortar]] or howitzer and was a hollow sphere filled with [[gunpowder]] charge. The top of the shell had thinner walls than the bottom and had an orifice into which was forced a wooden [[Fuse (explosives)|fuse]] normally made of [[beech]] wood. The fuse was designed to be ignited by the discharge of the gun and had a central channel drilled through it and filled with a burning compound. Before firing, the fuse was cut to a certain length corresponding to the desired time of burning and hammered into the top of the shell by a mallet. When it arrived over the target, the fuse, if correctly prepared, exploded the main charge, breaking open the metal outer casing and forcing flying fragments in all directions. Although favoured for [[siege]] work, the common shell was not always effective against infantry.<ref name=\"McNab146\">McNab, p. 146.</ref>\n\nThe final type of projectile for the field artillery used by the French was the incendiary or [[Carcass (projectile)|carcass]] (a name for an incendiary projectile). Initially, this device was composed of a metal frame, which was covered with a canvas cover and filled with a special recipe, typically 50 [[Potassium nitrate|saltpetre]] parts, 25 [[sulfur]] parts, 8 [[rosin]] parts, 5 [[antimony]] parts, and 5 [[Pitch (resin)|pitch]] parts. However, during the early 19th century, another form of carcass became common and this took the form of a common shell with two or three apertures in its exterior into which a similar composition was put. Carcass rounds were normally issued only to howitzers or mortars, the suggestion being they were intended to attack towns. This does not preclude them from being used on the field, but quite what their purpose would have been there is not clear.<ref>McNab, p. 147.</ref>\n\nIt is important to know that not all nations shared the same types of artillery projectiles. For example, the [[Congreve rocket]], inspired from the [[Mysore]]an [[rocket artillery]], or the [[shrapnel shell]], which combined the killing effect of grapeshot with the ranges achieved by round shot, were used only by the [[British Army during the Napoleonic Wars|British Army]].<ref name=\"McNab146\"/>\n\n====Artillery train====\n[[File:Gribeauval artillery train.jpg|thumb|A [[Jean-Baptiste Vaquette de Gribeauval|Gribeauval]] artillery [[Limbers and caissons|caisson]] on display at the ''[[Mus\u00e9e de l'Arm\u00e9e]]'', Paris]]\nThe ''train d'artillerie'', was established by Napoleon in January 1800. Its function was to provide the teamsters and drivers which handled the horses that hauled the artillery's vehicles.<ref>Elting, John R.: \"Swords Around A Throne\", p. 250, Da Capo Press, 1997</ref> Prior to this, the French, like all other period armies, had employed contracted, civilian teamsters who would sometimes abandon the guns under fire, rendering them immobile, rather than risk their lives or their valuable teams of horses.<ref name=Elting2>Elting, John R.:\"Swords Around A Throne\", pp. 254\u201355, Da Capo Press, 1997</ref> Its personnel, unlike their civilian predecessors, were armed, trained, and uniformed as soldiers. Apart from making them look better on parade, this made them subject to military discipline and capable of fighting back if attacked. The drivers were armed with a carbine, a short sword of the same type used by the infantry, and a pistol. They needed little encouragement to use these weapons, earning surly reputations for gambling, brawling, and various forms of mischief. Their uniforms and coats of grey helped enhance their tough appearance. But their combativeness could prove useful as they often found themselves attacked by Cossacks and Spanish and Tyrolian guerillas.\n\nEach ''train d'artillerie'' battalion was originally composed of 5 companies. The first company was considered elite and assigned to a horse artillery battery; the three \"centre\" companies were assigned to the foot artillery batteries and \"parks\" (spare caissons, field forges, supply wagons, etc.); and one became a depot company for training recruits and remounts. Following the campaigns of 1800, the train was re-organised into eight battalions of six companies each. As Napoleon enlarged his artillery, additional battalions were created, rising to a total of fourteen in 1810. In 1809, 1812, and 1813 the first thirteen battalions were \"doubled\" to create 13 additional battalions. Additionally, after 1809 some battalions raised extra companies to handle the regimental guns attached to the infantry.<ref name=Elting2/>\n\nThe Imperial Guard had its own train, which expanded as ''La Garde'''s artillery park was increased, albeit organised as regiments rather than battalions. At their zenith, in 1813\u201314, the Old Guard artillery was supported by a 12-company regiment while the Young Guard had a 16-company regiment, one for each of their component artillery batteries.<ref>Elting, John R.:\"Swords Around A Throne\", pp. 186, 194, Da Capo Press, 1997</ref>\n\n=== Foreign troops in the ''Grande Arm\u00e9e''===\n[[File:Prince Joseph Poniatowski by J\u00f3zef Grassi.jpg|thumb|upright|right|[[J\u00f3zef Poniatowski]], a Polish general and prince of the [[Duchy of Warsaw]] who served with the ''Grande Arm\u00e9e'' from 1807 to 1813, and was later made a [[Marshal of the Empire]] at the [[Battle of Leipzig]]]]\n{{See also|V Corps (Grande Arm\u00e9e)}}\nMany European armies recruited foreign troops, and France was no exception. Foreign troops played an important role and fought with distinction in the ''Grande Arm\u00e9e'' during the Napoleonic Wars. Almost every continental European country was, at different stages, a part of the ''Grande Arm\u00e9e''. By the end of the conflict, tens-of-thousands had served. In 1805, 35,000 troops from France's allies were used to protect lines of communications and flanks of the main army. In 1806, 27,000 more troops were called up for similar purposes, plus 20,000 Saxon troops who were used for mopping up operations against the Prussians. In the winter of 1806\u20137, Germans, Poles, and Spaniards helped seize the Baltic ports of [[Stralsund]] and [[Danzig]] on the army's left flank. At the Battle of Friedland in 1807, Marshal Lannes' corps was formed considerably from Poles, Saxons, and Dutch. For the first time, foreign troops had played a role in a major battle, and done so with distinction. During the War of the Fifth Coaltion, as many as one-third of the ''Grande Arm\u00e9e'', were from the Confederation of the Rhine,<ref name=Elting01b>Elting, John R. ''Swords Around A Throne''. Da Capo Press, 1997. P. 387.</ref> and one-quarter of the Army in Italy was Italian. At the ''Grande Arm\u00e9e''<nowiki/>'s peak in 1812, more than one-third of the troops that marched into Russia were non-French and represented 20 different countries, including Austria and Prussia. [[Julius von Grawert|Grawert]] initially led the Prussian detachment, but was replaced by [[Ludwig Yorck von Wartenburg|Yorck]].\n\n== Support services ==\n\n===Engineers===\n[[File:Lawrence Alma-Tadema 12.jpeg|thumb|250px|Dutch sappers of the ''Grande Arm\u00e9e'' during the [[Battle of Berezina]] in 1812]]\n[[File:Sapeur-23RIL.jpg|thumb|upright|A French pioneer during the Napoleonic Wars]]\n\nWhile the glory of battle went to the cavalry, infantry, and artillery, the army also included [[military engineer]]s of various types.\n\nThe bridge builders of the ''Grande Arm\u00e9e'', the ''pontonniers'', were an indispensable part of Napoleon's military machine. Their main contribution was helping the emperor to get his forces across water obstacles by erecting [[pontoon bridge]]s. The skills of his pontonniers allowed Napoleon to outflank enemy positions by crossing rivers where the enemy least expected and, in the case of the great retreat from Moscow, saved the army from complete annihilation at the Berezina River.\n\nThey may not have had the glory, but Napoleon clearly valued his ''pontonniers'' and had 14 companies commissioned into his armies, under the command of the brilliant engineer, General [[Jean Baptiste Ebl\u00e9]]. His training, along with their specialized tools and equipment, enabled them to quickly build the various parts of the bridges, which could then be rapidly assembled and reused later. All the needed materials, tools, and parts were carried on their wagon trains. If they did not have a part or item, it could be quickly made using the mobile wagon-mounted forges of the ''pontonniers''. A single company of ''pontonniers'' could construct a bridge of up to 80 pontoons (a span of some 120 to 150 metres long) in just under seven hours, an impressive feat even by today's standards.\n\nIn addition to the ''pontonniers'', there were companies of [[sapper]]s, to deal with enemy fortifications. They were used far less often in their intended role than the ''pontonniers''. However, since the emperor had learned in his early campaigns (such as the [[Siege of Acre (1799)|Siege of Acre]]) that it was better to bypass and isolate fixed fortifications, if possible, than to directly assault them, the sapper companies were usually put to other tasks.\n\nThe different types of engineer companies were formed into battalions and regiments called [[:fr:G\u00e9nie militaire|''G\u00e9nie'']], which was originally a [[Grande Arm\u00e9e slang|slang]] term for engineer. This name, which is still used today, was both a play on the word (''jeu de mot'') and a reference to their seemingly magical abilities to grant wishes and make things appear much like the mythical [[Genie]].\n\n===Logistics===\nOne of Napoleon's most quoted lines is his dictum that \"An army is a creature which marches on its stomach\", illustrating the vital importance of [[military logistics]]. The troops of the ''Grande Arm\u00e9e'' each carried four days' provisions. The supply wagon trains following them carried eight days', but these were to be consumed only in emergency. One man was allotted to 750 grams of bread, 550 grams of biscuits, 250 grams of meat, 30 grams of rice, and 60 grams of grain; one liter of wine was shared between four men. Insofar as possible, Napoleon encouraged his men to live off the land through foraging and requisition of food (which was known as ''[[La Maraude]]''). An integral part of the French logistics system was the inclusion in every regiment of several women known as ''cantini\u00e8res'' (also known as ''vivandi\u00e8res'', but ''cantini\u00e8re'' was by far the more common term among French troops). These women were married to soldiers in their regiments, and acted as sutlers, selling food and drink (especially alcohol) to the troops. They were considered \"absolutely necessary\" to the functioning of the army, and the Consular Decree of 7 Thermidor, Year VIII set their number at four per battalion and two per cavalry squadron.<ref>Cardoza, Thomas. ''Intrepid Women: Cantini\u00e8res and Vivandi\u00e8res of the French Army,'' Bloomington: Indiana University Press, 2010, 60-61.</ref> These women fed the troops when all other logistical arrangements broke down.\n\nAdditional supplies would be stockpiled and stored at forward bases and depots which Napoleon would establish before the start of his campaigns. These would then be moved forward as the army advanced. The supply bases of the ''Grande Arm\u00e9e'' would replenish the corps and divisional depots, which in turn would replenish the brigade and regimental supply trains, which would distribute rations and ammunition to the troops as needed to supplement their foraging. The reliance on foraging was sometimes determined by political pressures. When marching over friendly territory armies were told to \"live off what the country can supply\", but when marching over neutral territory they were issued with supplies. It was this system of planned and improvised logistics which enabled the ''Grande Arm\u00e9e'' to sustain rapid marches of up to 15 miles per day for up to five weeks. The logistical system was also aided by a technological innovation in the form of the food preservation technique invented by [[Nicolas Appert]], which led to modern [[canning]] methods.\n\n=== Medical Staff ===\n[[File:Ambulance of the French Army.jpg|thumb|The Flying Ambulances were developed by French battlefield surgeon Dominque-Jean Larrey to rapidly transport the wounded from the battlefield to field hospitals.]]\nThe medical services had the least glory or prestige, but were required to deal with the full horrors of the war's aftermath. The technology and practice of military medicine did not advance significantly during the Napoleonic Wars, but the ''Grande Arm\u00e9e'' did benefit from improvements in organisation and mobility. The established practice was for the wounded to be collected and treated after the battle had ended, by which time many wounded soldiers would have died. The systems adopted by the French Army in the Revolutionary and Napoleonic period were the forerunners of almost all modern military ambulance and triage systems, being adopted by the armies of most other Western nations in the following decades.\n\nThe most significant innovation was the establishment of a system of ''ambulances volantes'' (flying ambulances) in the closing years of the 18th century by [[Dominique Jean Larrey]] (who would later become Surgeon-General of the Imperial Guard). His inspiration was the use of fast horse artillery, or \"flying artillery\", which could manoeuver rapidly around the battlefield to provide urgent artillery support, or to escape an advancing enemy. The flying ambulance was designed to follow the advance guard and provide initial dressing of wounds (often under fire), while rapidly transporting the critically injured away from the battlefield. The personnel for a given ambulance team included a doctor, quartermaster, non-commissioned officer, a drummer boy (who carried the bandages), and 24 infantrymen as stretcher bearers.<ref>http://www.uwomj.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/2012_ER_Chan.pdf</ref>\n\nAnother French military surgeon, Baron L.P. Percy, implemented another system. He was the first to introduce \"a regularly trained corps of field litter bearers, soldiers regularly formed and equipped for the duty of picking up the wounded... and carrying them on stretchers to the place where means of surgical aid were provided\". Percy's system essentially served as a method of moving surgeons and their instruments closer to the engaged forces from where stretcher bearers would retrieve the wounded, rather than placing an emphasis on evacuating the wounded to the rear in a vehicle.\n\nDuring the Napoleonic Wars, every French regiment, division, and corps had its own medical staff, consisting of ambulance units, orderlies to perform nursing duties, apothecaries, surgeons, and doctors. Larrey was instrumental in reorganising military hospitals and making them more mobile. This was more than any other army would be able to offer until the 1850s and 1860s, half a century later. Knowing that they would be promptly attended to, then honored and well looked after once back home, helped boost morale in the ''Grande Arm\u00e9e'', and thus further contributed to its fighting abilities. The most revolutionary aspect of the system was Larrey's attention to the wounded on both sides of the battlefield, a practice now enshrined in various [[Geneva Conventions]]. Napoleon held the French medical services, and Larrey, in high regard. As stated in the ''M\u00e9morial de Sainte-H\u00e9l\u00e8ne'', ''\"The Emperor had only the highest praise for Dr Larrey, declaring that he left him with the image of a truly good man who combined all the virtues of effective philanthropy and science to the highest degree. Every wounded soldier was a member of his family. Larrey is the most virtuous man I have ever met.\"''\n\nDespite these innovations, conditions in the ''Grande Arm\u00e9e'', as in all armies of the time, were primitive at best. Far more soldiers died of their wounds or from sickness than in battle (see [[Napoleonic Wars casualties]]). There was little knowledge of [[hygiene]] and nothing of [[antibiotic]]s. The main surgical procedure was [[amputation]]. The only crude form of [[anaesthetic]] readily available was a strong [[alcohol (drug)|alcohol]]ic drink, or even, in some cases, knocking the patient unconscious. Opiates such as [[laudanum]] were occasionally available for pain control. Typically, only about two-thirds survived such an operation, but this number increased with swift attention.\n\nAccounts of the ordeals of the wounded are horrific reading. Napoleon himself once noted, ''\"It requires more courage to suffer than to die\"'', so he made sure those who did survive were given the best treatment available at hospitals in France, in particular [[Les Invalides]], while they recuperated. The wounded survivours were often treated as heroes, awarded medals, pensions, and provided with [[prosthetic limb]]s if needed.\n\n=== Communications ===\nMost [[dispatch (logistics)|dispatches]] were conveyed as they had been for centuries, via messengers on horseback. Hussars, due to their bravery and riding skills, were often favoured for this task. Shorter range tactical signals could be sent visually by flags or audibly by drums, bugles, trumpets, and other musical instruments. Thus, standard bearers and musicians, in addition to their symbolic, ceremonial, and morale functions, also played important communication roles.\n[[File:Tour du telegraphe Chappe Saverne 02.JPG|thumb|right|A Chappe [[Optical telegraph|semaphore]] tower near [[Saverne]], France]]\nThe ''Grande Arm\u00e9e'' did benefit from innovations made in long-range communications during the French Revolution. The French Army was among the first to employ [[War pigeon|homing pigeons]] as messengers in any large and organised manner, and also the first to use [[Hot air balloon|observation balloons]] for reconnaissance and communications.{{citation needed|date=March 2014}} But the real advance for conveying long-range dispatches came in the form of an ingenious optical telegraph Semaphore system]invented by [[Claude Chappe]].{{citation needed|date=March 2014}}\n\nChappe's system consisted of an intricate network of small towers, within visual range of one another. On top of each was a 9-metre mast, with three large, movable wooden rods mounted on them.{{citation needed|date=March 2014}} These rods, called the ''r\u00e9gulateur'' (regulator), were operated by trained crews using a series of pulleys and levers. The four basic positions of the rods could be combined to form 196 different \"signs\".{{citation needed|date=March 2014}} Provided with good crews of operators and decent visibility conditions, a sign could be sent through the 15 station towers between Paris and [[Lille]], a distance of {{convert|193|km|mi|abbr=on}}, in only 9 minutes, a complete message of 36 signs in about 32 minutes. From Paris to [[Venice]], a message could be sent in only six hours.{{citation needed|date=March 2014}}\n\nChappe's telegraph soon became one of Napoleon's favourite and most important secret weapons. A special portable version semaphore telegraph travelled with his headquarters.{{citation needed|date=March 2014}} Using it, he was able to coordinate his logistics and forces over longer distances in far less time than his enemies. Work was even begun on a wagon-mounted version in 1812, but was not completed in time for use in the wars.{{citation needed|date=March 2014}}\n\n== Formations and tactics ==\n[[File:Grenadier Pied 1 1812 Revers.png|thumb|Banner of the 1st Regiment of ''Grenadier a Pied'', showing the regiment's battle honours]]\n\nWhile Napoleon is best known as a master strategist and charismatic presence on the battlefield, he was also a tactical innovator. He combined classic formations and tactics that had been used for thousands of years with more recent ones, such as [[Frederick the Great]]'s \"Oblique Order\" (best illustrated at the [[Battle of Leuthen]]) and the \"mob tactics\" of the early ''[[Lev\u00e9e en masse]]'' armies of the [[Lev\u00e9e en masse#The French Revolutionary Wars|Revolution]]. Napoleonic tactics and formations were highly fluid and flexible. In contrast, many of the ''Grande Arm\u00e9e''<nowiki/>'s opponents were still wedded to a rigid system of \"Linear\" (or Line) tactics and formations, in which masses of infantry would simply line up and exchange vollies of fire, in an attempt to either blow the enemy from the field or outflank them. Due to the vulnerabilities of the line formations to flanking attacks, it was considered the highest form of military manoeuvre to outflank one's adversary. Armies would often retreat or even surrender if this was accomplished. Consequently, commanders who adhered to this system would place a great emphasis on flank security, often at the expense of a strong centre or reserve. Napoleon would frequently take full advantage of this linear mentality by feigning flank attacks or offering the enemy his own flank as \"bait\" (best illustrated at the Battle of Austerlitz and also later a L\u00fctzen), then throw his main effort against their centre, split their lines, and roll up their flanks. He always kept a strong reserve as well, mainly in the form of his Imperial Guard, which could deliver a \"knockout blow\" if the battle was going well or turn the tide if it was not.\n\nSome of the more famous, widely used, effective, and interesting formations and tactics included:\n* '''[[Line (formation)|Line]]''' (''Ligne''): The basic three rank line formation, best used for delivering volley fire and was also a decent melee formation for infantry or cavalry, but it was relatively slow moving and vulnerable on the flanks.\n* '''[[Column (formation)|March Column]]''' (''Colonne de Marche''): The best formation for rapid or sustained movement of troops and a good melee attacking formation, but it offered little firepower and was also vulnerable to flank attack, ambush, artillery, and \"funneling\".\n* '''[[Flying wedge|Wedge]]''' (''Colonne de Charge''): An arrow or spearhead shaped cavalry formation, designed to close rapidly and break the enemy's line. Classic and effective mounted formation used throughout history, and still used by tanks today. But if the wedge was halted, or its attack lost momentum, then it was vulnerable to counter-[[pincer movement]]s on its flanks.\n* '''Attack Column''' (''Colonne d'Attaque''): A wide column of infantry, almost a hybrid of line and column, with light infantry skirmishers in front to disrupt the enemy and screen the column's advance. Once the column closed, the skirmishers would move off to its flanks, then the column would fire a massed musket salvo and charge with their bayonets. An excellent formation against a standard, thin line. The Attack Column was developed from the \"Mob\" or \"Horde\" tactics of the early French Revolutionary Armies. Its disadvantages were a lack of massed firepower and vulnerability to artillery fire.\n* '''[[Mixed Order]]''' (''Ordre Mixte''): Was Napoleon's preferred infantry formation. Some units (usually regiments or battalions in size) would be placed in line formation, with other units in attack column behind and in between them. This combined the firepower of the line with the speed, melee, and skirmishing advantages of the attack column. It also had some of the disadvantages of both, so support from artillery and cavalry were especially vital for this tactic to succeed.\n* '''[[Skirmisher|Open Order]]''' (''Ordre Ouvert''): Foot and/or horse would spread out by unit and/or individually. This formation was best for light troops and skirmishers. It allowed for rapid movement, especially over broken or rough terrain such as hills or forests, and offered the best protection from enemy fire since the troops were spread out. Its disadvantages were it did not allow for massed or volley fire and was terrible for melee or close quarters fighting and thus, especially vulnerable to cavalry.\n* '''[[Infantry square|Square]]''' (''Carr\u00e9''): Classic infantry formation for defence against cavalry. Soldiers would form a hollow square at least three or four ranks deep on each side, with officers and artillery or cavalry in the middle. It offered infantry their best protection against charges, especially on good defensive terrain such as on the top or reverse slope of a hill. Squares were slow moving, almost stationary targets, however. This, along with their density, made squares very vulnerable to artillery and to a lesser extent, infantry fire. Once broken, squares tended to completely collapse.\n* '''Flying Battery''' (''Batterie Volante''): Designed to take advantage of the French artillery's mobility and training. A battery would move to one area on the field, lay down a short, sharp barrage, then rapidly redeploy to another area and fire another barrage, then quickly redeploy again, etc. The combined, cumulative effect of numerous batteries doing this all along the enemy's lines could be devastating. The horse artillery were especially well suited for this tactic. Napoleon used it to great success in the early campaigns of the ''Grande Arm\u00e9e''. Its flexibility allowed him to quickly mass well-aimed fire anywhere it was needed. But it required superbly trained and conditioned artillerymen and horses as well as close command, coordination, and control in order to work.\n* '''[[Grand Battery]]''' (''Grande Batterie''): An alternative artillery tactic, when circumstances prohibited the flying batteries. Artillery would mass its fire at a single, crucial point on the battlefield (usually against the enemy's centre). It could be devastating if the enemy was caught by surprise or in the open. But massing large numbers of guns in a single area without the enemy's knowledge could be tricky. Once the battery opened fire and its target became clear, measures could be taken to avoid it. It was also vulnerable to [[counter-battery fire]] from enemy artillery and needed protection from cavalry attack. Although this has become the most well known French artillery tactic, Napoleon preferred the flying batteries and used it only when he had to or thought it posed a better chance of success. Often at the start of a battle, he would mass batteries into a large battery, then after a few salvoes, break it up into flying batteries. In the early campaigns it was rarely used, but as the quantity of the horses of the ''Grande Arm\u00e9e'' and the quality of its artillerymen declined, Napoleon would be forced to employ it much more frequently in later battles.\n* '''Boar's Head''' (''T\u00eate du Sanglier''): Another hybrid formation, somewhat like the mixed order, but combining all three arms into a wedge-like square, which could be used for assault or defence. Infantry would form a short, but thick, line many ranks deep on the front, which would be the boar's \"snout\" (''boutoir''). Behind them would be two groups of artillery batteries or the \"eyes\" of the boar. On their flanks and behind them, in oblique order, would be other infantry in column, line, or square to form the boar's \"face\". Protecting their flanks and rear would be two groups of cavalry, which would serve as the boar's \"tusk\". This was a highly complex formation, which could not be formed as easily or quickly as the others. Once formed, except for the tusks, it had slow mobility. It was, however, faster moving than the traditional square and less vulnerable to artillery or infantry fire. The \"tusks\" also gave it stronger offensive capabilities. It would later be employed to great effect during the French conquests in North Africa during the 1830s and 1840s, and would be used up until the 1920s.\n\n== Ranks of the ''Grande Arm\u00e9e''==\n{{Main|Ranks of the Grande Arm\u00e9e}}\nUnlike the armies of the ''[[Ancien R\u00e9gime]]'' and other monarchies, advancement in the ''Grande Arm\u00e9e'' was based on proven ability rather than social class or wealth. Napoleon wanted his army to be a [[meritocracy]], where every soldier, no matter how humble of birth, could rise rapidly to the highest levels of command, much as he had done (provided, of course, they did not rise too high or too fast).{{Citation needed|date=September 2014}} This was equally applied to the French and foreign officers, and no less than 140 foreigners attained the rank of ''G\u00e9n\u00e9ral''.<ref> Dempsey, p. 19.</ref> By and large this goal was achieved. Given the right opportunities to prove themselves, capable men could rise to the top within a few years, whereas in other armies it usually required decades if at all. It was said that even the lowliest private carried a marshal's baton in his knapsack.\n\n''Mar\u00e9chal d'Empire'', or [[Marshal of the Empire]], was not a rank within the ''Grande Arm\u00e9e'', but a personal title granted to distinguished divisional generals, along with higher pay and privileges. The same applied to the corps commanders (''General de Corps d'armee'') and army commanders (''General en chef''). The highest permanent rank in the ''Grande Arm\u00e9e'' was actually ''G\u00e9n\u00e9ral de division'' and those higher than it were positions of the same rank but with separate insignia for appointment holders.<ref>Elting, John R.:\"Swords Around A Throne.\", p. 124. Da Capo Press, 1997.</ref> The position of Colonel General of a branch (such as dragoons or grenadiers of the Guard) was akin to Chief Inspector-General of that branch, whose office holder used his current officer rank and its corresponding insignia.\n\n:::::::{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!''Grande Arm\u00e9e'' ranks !!

From 1804 to 1809, the ''Grande Arm\u00e9e'' scored a series of historic victories that gave the [[First French Empire|French Empire]] an unprecedented grip on power over the [[Europe|European continent]]. Widely acknowledged to be one of the greatest fighting forces ever assembled, it suffered terrible losses during the [[French invasion of Russia]] in 1812 and never recovered its tactical superiority after that campaign.\n\nIt was renamed in 1804 from the army that Napoleon had assembled on the French coast of the [[English Channel]] for the [[Napoleon's planned invasion of the United Kingdom|proposed invasion]] of [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|Britain]]. Napoleon later deployed the army east in order to eliminate the threat of [[Austrian Empire|Austria]] and [[Russian Empire|Russia]], which were part of the [[War of the Third Coalition|Third Coalition]] assembled against France. Thereafter, the name was used for the principal French Army deployed in the [[War of the Third Coalition|campaigns of 1805]] and [[War of the Fourth Coalition|1807]], where it got its prestige, and [[War of the Fifth Coalition|1809]], 1812, and [[War of the Sixth Coalition|1813\u201314]]. In practice, however, the term ''Grande Arm\u00e9e'' is used in English to refer to all of the multinational forces gathered by Napoleon in his campaigns.<ref>Elting, John R.: \"Swords Around a Throne\", pp. 60\u201365. Da Capo Press, 1997.</ref>\n\nThe first ''Grande Arm\u00e9e'' consisted of six [[corps]] under the command of Napoleon's [[Marshal of the Empire|marshals]] and senior generals. When Napoleon discovered that the Austrian and Russian armies were preparing to invade France in late 1805, the ''Grande Arm\u00e9e'' was quickly ordered across the [[Rhine]] into Southern Germany, leading to Napoleon's victories at [[Battle of Ulm|Ulm]] and [[Battle of Austerlitz|Austerlitz]].\n\nThe army grew as Napoleon spread his power across Europe and reached its largest size of 1 million men{{sfn|Mearsheimer|2001|p=285}} at the start of the Russian campaign in 1812. Of those soldiers, 685,000{{sfn|Bodart|1916|p=126}} would participate in the invasion. The contingents were commanded by French generals, except for the [[Duchy of Warsaw|Polish]] corps and an Austrian one. The huge multinational army marched slowly east, and the Russians fell back with its approach. After the capture of [[Battle of Smolensk (1812)|Smolensk]] and victory at [[Battle of Borodino|Borodino]], the ''Grande Arm\u00e9e'' reached Moscow on 14 September 1812. However, the army was already drastically reduced because of deaths and injuries from battles with the Russians, disease (principally [[typhus]]), [[desertion]], and long communication lines. The army spent a month in Moscow but was ultimately forced to march back westward. It started to suffer from cold, starvation and disease, and was constantly harassed by [[Cossacks]] and Russian partisans, resulting in the ''Grande Arm\u00e9e'' being utterly destroyed as a fighting force. Only 120,000 men survived to leave Russia (excluding early deserters). Of these, 50,000 were Austrians, Prussians, and other Germans, 20,000 were Poles, and just 35,000 were Frenchmen.<ref>Zamoyski, p. 536</ref> As many as 380,000 died in the campaign.<ref>[http://entomology.montana.edu/historybug/napoleon/typhus_russia.htm Insects, Disease, and Military History: Destruction of the Grand Arm\u00e9e] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080820045117/http://entomology.montana.edu/historybug/napoleon/typhus_russia.htm |date=2008-08-20 }}</ref>\n\nNapoleon led a new army at the [[Battle of Leipzig|Battle of the Nations]] at [[Leipzig]] in 1813, the [[1814 campaign in north-east France|defence of France]] in 1814, and the [[Waterloo campaign]] in 1815, but the ''Grande Arm\u00e9e'' would never regain its heights of June 1812.\n\n== History ==\n''For a history of the French Army in the period 1792\u20131804 during the wars of the First and Second Coalitions see [[French Revolutionary Army]].''\n\n===1804\u20131806===\n[[File:Premiere-legion-dhonneur.jpg|thumb|Napoleon distributing the first medals of the [[Legion of Honour|''L\u00e9gion d'honneur'']] at Boulogne, August 1804|205x205px]]\n{{See also|Napoleon's planned invasion of the United Kingdom}}\nThe ''Grande Arm\u00e9e'' was originally formed as L'Arm\u00e9e des c\u00f4tes de l'Oc\u00e9an (Army of the Ocean Coasts) intended for the invasion of Britain, at the port of [[Boulogne-sur-Mer|Boulogne]] in 1803. Following Napoleon's coronation as Emperor of the French in 1804, the Third Coalition was formed against him and ''Grande Arm\u00e9e'' turned its sights eastwards in 1805. The ''Grande Arm\u00e9e'' left the Boulogne camps late in August and through a rapid march surrounded General [[Karl Mack von Leiberich|Mack]]'s isolated Austrian Army at the fortress of [[Ulm]]. The [[Ulm campaign]], as it came to be known, resulted in 60,000 Austrian prisoners at the cost of just 2,000 French soldiers. By November, Vienna was taken but Austria refused to capitulate, maintaining an army in the field. In addition, its ally Russia had yet to commit to action. The war would continue for a while longer. Affairs were decisively settled on December 2, 1805, at the [[Battle of Austerlitz]], where the numerically inferior ''Grande Arm\u00e9e'' routed a combined Russo-Austrian army led by Emperor [[Alexander I of Russia|Alexander I]]. The stunning victory led to the [[Treaty of Pressburg (1805)|Treaty of Pressburg]] on December 26, 1805, with the dissolution of the [[Holy Roman Empire]] the following year.<ref name=\"year\">Fisher, Todd & Gregory Fremont-Barnes, ''The Napoleonic Wars: The Rise and Fall of an Empire.'', pp. 36\u201354.</ref>\n\n[[File:Austerlitz-baron-Pascal.jpg|thumb|right|''The [[Battle of Austerlitz]], 2nd December 1805'', by [[Fran\u00e7ois G\u00e9rard]]|287x287px]]\n\nThe alarming increase of French power in Central Europe disturbed [[Kingdom of Prussia|Prussia]], which had remained neutral in the conflicts of the previous year. After much diplomatic wrangling, Prussia secured promises of Russian military aid and the Fourth Coalition against France came into being in 1806. The ''Grande Arm\u00e9e'' advanced into Prussian territory with the famed ''bataillon-carr\u00e9'' (battalion square) system, whereby corps marched in close supporting distances and became vanguards, rearguards, or flank forces as the situation demanded, and decisively defeated the Prussian armies at [[Battle of Jena\u2013Auerstedt|Jena and Auerstedt]], both fought on October 14, 1806. After a legendary pursuit, the French captured about 140,000 Prussians and killed and wounded roughly 25,000. [[Louis-Nicolas Davout|Davout]]'s [[III Corps (Grande Arm\u00e9e)|III Corps]], the victors at Auerstadt, received the honours of first marching into Berlin.

A difficult winter campaign produced nothing but a stalemate, made worse by the [[Battle of Eylau]] on February 7\u20138, 1807, where Russian and French casualties soared for little gain. The campaign resumed in the spring and this time [[Levin August von Bennigsen|Bennigsen]]'s Russian Army was soundly defeated at the [[Battle of Friedland]] on June 14, 1807. This victory produced the [[Treaties of Tilsit]] between France and Russia and Prussia in July, leaving Napoleon with no enemies on the continent.<ref name=\"continent\">Fisher & Fremont-Barnes pp. 76\u201392</ref>\n\n[[Kingdom of Portugal|Portugal]]'s refusal to comply with the [[Continental System]] led to a punitive French expedition in late 1807. This campaign formed the basis for the [[Peninsular War]], which was to last six years and drain the [[First French Empire|First Empire]] of vital resources and manpower. The French attempted to occupy Spain in 1808, but a series of [[Battle of Bail\u00e9n|disasters]] prompted Napoleon to intervene personally later in the year. The 125,000-strong ''Grande Arm\u00e9e'' marched forward, capturing the fortress of [[Burgos]], clearing the way to [[Madrid]] at the [[Battle of Somosierra]], and forcing the Spanish armies to retreat. They then engaged [[John Moore (British soldier)|Moore]]'s British army, prompting the British to withdraw from the [[Iberian Peninsula]] after a heroic action at the [[Battle of Corunna]] on January 16, 1809. The campaign was successful, but it would still be some time before the French were able to occupy Southern Spain.<ref name=\"Spain\">Fisher & Fremont-Barnes pp. 200\u201309</ref>\n\n[[File:Napoleon Wagram.jpg|left|thumb|Napoleon at the [[Battle of Wagram]], 16 July 1809, by [[Horace Vernet]]]]\n\nMeanwhile, a revived Austria was preparing to strike. The [[war hawk]]s at the court of Emperor [[Francis II, Holy Roman Emperor|Francis I]] convinced him to take full advantage of France's preoccupation with Spain. In April 1809, the Austrians opened the campaign without a formal declaration of war and caught the French by surprise. They were too slow to exploit their gains, however, and Napoleon's arrival from Paris finally stabilized the situation. The Austrians were defeated at the [[Battle of Eckm\u00fchl]], fled over the [[Danube River|Danube]], and lost the fortress of [[Ratisbon]]. But they still remained a cohesive, fighting force, which meant further campaigning was required to settle the issue. The French captured Vienna and attempted to cross the Danube via Lobau island southeast of the Austrian capital, but they lost the subsequent [[Battle of Aspern-Essling]], the first defeat for the ''Grande Arm\u00e9e''. A second attempt to cross the river proved more successful in July and set the stage for the two-day [[Battle of Wagram]], where the French emerged victorious, inflicting some 40,000 casualties on the Austrians, but suffering 37,000 themselves. The defeat demoralized the Austrians so heavily that they agreed to an [[armistice]] shortly afterwards. This eventually led to the [[Treaty of Sch\u00f6nbrunn|Peace of Sch\u00f6nbrunn]] in October 1809. The ''Grande Arm\u00e9e'' had brought the Fifth Coalition to an end and the Austrian Empire lost three million subjects as a result of the treaty's border changes.<ref name=\"changes\">Fisher & Fremont-Barnes pp. 113\u201344</ref>\n\n===1810\u20131812===\nWith the exception of Spain, a three-year lull ensued. Diplomatic tensions with Russia, however, became so acute that they eventually led to war in 1812. Napoleon assembled the largest field army he had ever commanded to deal with this menace. On 24 June 1812, shortly before the invasion, the assembled troops with a total strength of 685,000 men were made up of:<ref>Riehn, Richard K.

The behemoth force crossed the [[Neman|Niemen River]] on June 24, 1812, and Napoleon hoped that quick marching could place his men between the two main Russian armies, commanded by [[Michael Andreas Barclay de Tolly|Barclay de Tolly]] and [[Pyotr Bagration]]. However, the campaign was characterized by many frustrations, as the Russians succeeded no less than three times in evading Napoleon's pincers. A final stand for the defence of Moscow led to the massive Battle of Borodino on September 7, 1812. There the ''Grande Arm\u00e9e'' won a bloody but indecisive and arguably [[pyrrhic victory]]. A week after the battle, the ''Grande Arm\u00e9e'' finally entered Moscow only to find the city largely empty and ablaze. Its soldiers were now forced to deal with the fires while hunting down arsonists and guarding the city's historic districts. Napoleon and his army spent over a month in Moscow, vainly hoping that the Russian emperor would respond to the French peace offers. After these efforts failed, the French set out on October 19, now only a shadow of their former selves. The epic retreat over the famous Russian winter dominates popular conceptions of the war, even though over half of the ''Grande Arm\u00e9e'' had been lost during the summer. The French were harassed repeatedly by the converging Russian armies, Marshal [[Michel Ney|Ney]] even conducting a famous rearguard separation between his troops and the Russians, and by the time the [[Berezina River|Berezina]] was reached Napoleon only had about 49,000 troops and 40,000 stragglers of little military value. The resulting [[Battle of Berezina|battle]] and the monumental work of [[Jean Baptiste Ebl\u00e9|Ebl\u00e9]]'s engineers saved the remnants of the ''Grande Arm\u00e9e''. Napoleon left his men in order to reach Paris and address new military and political matters. Of the 685,000 men that constituted the initial invasion force, only 93,000 survived.<ref name=\"survived\">Fisher & Fremont-Barnes pp. 145\u201371</ref>\n\n{{wide image|Minard.png|750px|3=[[Charles Joseph Minard]]'s famous graph showing the decreasing size of the Grande Arm\u00e9e as it marches to Moscow (brown line, from left to right) and back (black line, from right to left) with the size of the army equal to the width of the line.

The Sixth Coalition was formed and Germany became the centrepiece of the upcoming campaign. With customary genius, Napoleon raised new armies and opened up the campaign with a series of victories at [[Battle of L\u00fctzen (1813)|L\u00fctzen]] and [[Battle of Bautzen|Bautzen]]. But due to the poor quality of French troops and cavalry following the Russian campaign, along with miscalculations by certain subordinate marshals, these triumphs were not decisive enough to win the war and only secured an armistice. Napoleon hoped to use this respite to increase the quantity and improve the quality of the ''Grande Arm\u00e9e'', but when Austria joined the Allies, his strategic situation grew bleak. The campaign reopened in August with a significant French victory at the two-day [[Battle of Dresden]]. However, the adoption of the [[Trachenberg Plan]] by the Allies, which called for avoiding direct conflict with Napoleon and focusing on his subordinates, paid dividends as the French suffered defeats at [[Battle of the Katzbach|Katzbach]], [[Battle of Kulm|Kulm]], [[Battle of Gro\u00dfbeeren|Gro\u00dfbeeren]], and [[Battle of Dennewitz|Dennewitz]]. Growing Allied numbers eventually hemmed the French in at Leipzig, where the famous three-day Battle of the Nations witnessed a heavy loss for Napoleon when a bridge was prematurely destroyed, abandoning 30,000 French soldiers on the other side of the [[White Elster|Elster River]]. The campaign, however, did end on a victorious note when the French destroyed an isolated Bavarian corps which was trying to block their retreat at [[Battle of Hanau|Hanau]].<ref name=\"hanau\">Fisher & Fremont-Barnes pp. 271\u201387</ref>\n\n[[File:Jean-Louis-Ernest Meissonier-Campagne de France.jpg|thumb|right|''Napoleon and his staff are returning from Soissons after the [[Battle of Laon|battle of Laon]]'', by [[Ernest Meissonier]]|222x222px]]\n\n\"The Grand Empire is no more. It is France herself we must now defend\" were Napoleon's words to the Senate at the end of 1813. The emperor managed to raise new armies, but strategically he was in a virtually hopeless position. Allied armies were invading from the [[Pyrenees]], across the plains of Northern Italy, and via France's eastern borders as well. The campaign began ominously when Napoleon suffered a defeat at the [[Battle of La Rothi\u00e8re]], but he quickly regained his former spirit. In the [[Six Days' Campaign|Six Days' campaign]] of February 1814, the 30,000-man ''Grande Arm\u00e9e'' inflicted 20,000 casualties on [[Gebhard Leberecht von Bl\u00fccher|Bl\u00fccher]]'s scattered corps at a cost of just 2,000 for themselves. They then headed south and defeated [[Karl Philipp, Prince of Schwarzenberg|Schwarzenberg]]'s corps at the [[Battle of Montereau]]. These victories, however, could not remedy such a bad situation, and French defeats at the [[Battle of Laon]] and the [[Battle of Arcis-sur-Aube]] dampened moods. At the end of March, [[Battle of Paris (1814)|Paris fell to the Allies]]. Napoleon wanted to keep fighting, but his marshals refused, forcing him to abdicate on April 6, 1814.<ref name=\"abdicate\">Fisher & Fremont-Barnes pp. 287\u201397</ref>\n\n[[File:Battle of Waterloo 1815.PNG|thumb|left|The [[Battle of Waterloo]] marked the final defeat of Napoleon and the ''Grande Arm\u00e9e'', as well as the end of the Napoleonic Wars.|285x285px]]\n\nAfter returning from exile on [[Principality of Elba|Elba]] in February 1815, Napoleon busied himself in making a renewed push to secure his empire. For the first time since 1812, the [[Army of the North (France)|Army of the North]] he would be commanding for the upcoming campaign was professional and competent. Napoleon hoped to catch and defeat the Allied armies under [[Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington|Wellington]] and Bl\u00fccher in Belgium before the Russians and Austrians could arrive. The campaign, beginning on June 15, 1815, was initially successful, leading to victory over the Prussians at the [[Battle of Ligny]] on June 16; however, poor staff work, and bad commanders led to many problems for the ''Grande Arm\u00e9e'' throughout the entire campaign. Marshal [[Emmanuel de Grouchy, marquis de Grouchy|Grouchy]]'s delayed advance against the Prussians allowed Bl\u00fccher to rally his men after Ligny and march on to Wellington's aid at the [[Battle of Waterloo]], which resulted in the final, decisive defeat for Napoleon.<ref name=\"army\">Fisher & Fremont-Barnes pp. 306\u201312</ref>\n\n== Staff system ==\nPrior to the late 18th century, there was generally no organisational support for staff functions such as [[military intelligence]], [[logistics]], planning or personnel. [[Military organization|Unit]] [[Commanding officer|commanders]] handled such functions for their units, with informal help from subordinates who were usually not trained for or assigned to a specific task.\n\nThe first modern use of a General Staff was in the [[French Revolutionary Wars]], when General [[Louis-Alexandre Berthier]] (later Marshal of the Empire) was assigned as Chief of Staff to the [[Army of Italy (France)|Army of Italy]] in 1795. Berthier was able to establish a well-organised staff support team. Napoleon took over the army the following year and quickly came to appreciate Berthier's system, adopting it for his own headquarters, although Napoleon's usage was limited to his own command group.\n\nThe Staff of the ''Grande Arm\u00e9e'' was known as the Imperial Headquarters and was divided into two major sections: Napoleon's Military Household and the Army General Headquarters. A third department dependent on the Imperial Headquarters was the office of the ''Intendant G\u00e9n\u00e9ral'' (Quartermaster General), providing the administrative staff of the army.<ref name=McNab40>McNab, p. 40.</ref>\n\n=== Napoleon's Military Household ===\n[[File:Napoleon bivouac Wagram.jpg|thumb|upright=1.4|Napoleon snatching a moment's rest on the battlefield of Wagram, with his staff and household working around him]]\nThe Maison Militaire de l'Empereur ([[Military Household of the Emperor]]) was Napoleon's personal military staff and included the department of [[Aide-de-camp|aides-de-camp]] (ADCs), orderly officers (until 1809), the Emperor's Cabinet with the Secretariat, a department that collected intelligence about the enemy using spies and the topographical department.<ref name=McNab40/> Attached was also the Emperor's Civil Cabinet that included the office of the [[Grand Marshal of the Palace]] and the [[Master of the Horse#The French Master of the Horse|Grand \u00c9cuyer]].\n\nThe ADCs to the emperor were mainly loyal, experienced generals or, at times, other senior officers whom he knew from his Italian or [[French campaign in Egypt and Syria|Egyptian]] campaigns. All were famous for their bravery and were experts in their own branches of service. Working directly under the supervision of the emperor, these officers were sometimes assigned to temporary command of units or formations or entrusted with diplomatic missions. Most of the time, however, their tasks consisted of making detailed inspection tours and long-distance reconnaissances. When they had to carry orders from the emperor to an army commander, these would be verbal rather than written. The appointment of ADC to the emperor was so influential that they were considered to be \"Napoleon's eyes and ears\" and even marshals were wise to follow their advice and render them the respect due to their function.<ref>McNab, pp. 40\u201342.</ref>\n\nOn 29 April 1809, a decree organised their service. Every morning at 0700, the duty ADC and his staff were relieved and the new ADC for the next 24 hours had to present the emperor with a list of names of the staff under his command. This would consist of two supplementary daytime general ADCs and one night ADC, one equerry and (through a rotation system) half the number of orderly officers, half the number of the ''petits aides de camp'' (two or three personal ADCs to the general ADCs, who might also be commanded directly by the emperor) and half the number of pages. Their number differed from time to time, but only 37 officers were ever commissioned ADC to the emperor and at normal times their number was restricted to 12. Each of these officers wore the normal general's uniform of his rank, but with gold [[aiguilette]]s as the symbol of his function. The appointment of ADC to the emperor did not always last as long as the emperor's reign; an ADC might be given another position such as a field command, a governorship, etc. and would be removed from his ADC status until recalled to that post.<ref>McNab, p. 42.</ref>\n\nThe ''officiers d'ordonnance'' (orderly officers) may be considered as junior ADCs, with the rank of ''[[chef d'escadron]]'', [[Captain (armed forces)|captain]] or [[lieutenant]]. They, too, were used for special missions such as reconnaissance and inspections, but also to carry written orders. In 1806, when these posts were created, they were members of the [[Imperial Guard (Napoleon I)|Imperial Guard]]; in 1809, while retaining their military status, they were taken under control of the ''Grand \u00c9cuyer'' in the Emperor's Civil Household. The decrees regulating their service were signed on 15, 19 and 24 September 1806 and finally on 19 September 1809.<ref>McNab, pp. 42\u201344.</ref>\n\n=== Army General Headquarters ===\nAlongside the Emperor's Military Household but functioning as a totally independent organisation was the ''Grand \u00c9tat-Major G\u00e9n\u00e9ral'' (Army General Headquarters). Since the earliest collaboration of Napoleon and Berthier, its organisation was more or less fixed and it would see only slight changes during the later campaigns of the empire.<ref name=McNab44>McNab, p. 44</ref> The Army General Headquarters included the office of the ''Major-G\u00e9n\u00e9ral'''s (Chief of Staff's) Cabinet with their four departments: Movements, Secretariat, Accounting and Intelligence (orders of battle). The ''Major-G\u00e9n\u00e9ral'' also had his own private Military Staff which included duty Generals and Staff aides-de-camp. Finally there was the Army General Staff with the offices of the three Assistant Major-Generals to the ''Major-G\u00e9n\u00e9ral''.\n\n[[File:Louis-Alexandre Berthier.png|thumb|left|Louis-Alexandre Berthier acted as Napoleon's Chief of Staff from 1796 until 1814, after his death being replaced by [[Jean-de-Dieu Soult]] during the [[Hundred Days]].|293x293px]]\nThe role of Chief of Staff in the ''Grande Arm\u00e9e'' became almost synonymous with Berthier, who occupied this position in almost all the major campaigns of Napoleon. The General Headquarters was Berthier's unique domain and the emperor respected this demarcation. Its personnel received orders only from Berthier and even Napoleon did not interfere in its immense tasks; he would never walk in on Berthier's private staff while they were writing and copying the orders that he had just given. Since the emperor was his own \"operations officer\", it can be said that Berthier's job consisted of absorbing Napoleon's strategic intentions, translating them into written orders and transmitting them with the utmost speed and clarity. He also received in the emperor's name the reports of the marshals and commanding generals and when necessary signed them on Napoleon's behalf. Detailed reports on everything that occurred for good or ill were to be sent to Berthier, who would in turn select the most important ones and transmit them to the emperor; nothing was to be concealed from Napoleon.<ref name=McNab44/>\n\nLest one think this was a safe officejob of the modern staff officers, a contemporary subordinate staff officer, Brossier, reports that at the [[Battle of Marengo]]:<blockquote>\n\"The General-in-Chief Berthier gave his orders with the precision of a consummate warrior, and at Marengo maintained the reputation that he so rightly acquired in Italy and in Egypt under the orders of Bonaparte. He himself was hit by a bullet in the arm. Two of his aides-de-camp, Dutaillis and La Borde, had their horses killed.\"<ref>Watson, p. 92</ref></blockquote>\n== Organisation ==\n[[File:Grande-armee en.svg|thumb|Organisation of the ''Grande Arm\u00e9e'' during the [[War of the Third Coalition]]|252x252px]]\nOne of the most important factors in the ''Grande Arm\u00e9e''<nowiki/>'s success was its superior and highly flexible organisation. It was subdivided into several [[corps]] (usually from five to seven), each numbering anywhere between 10,000 and 50,000, with the average size being around 20,000 to 30,000 troops. These ''Corps d'Arm\u00e9e'' were self-contained, smaller armies of [[combined arms]], consisting of elements from all the forces and support services discussed below. While capable of fully independent operations and of defending themselves until reinforced, the corps usually worked in close concert together and kept within a day's marching distance of one another. The corps would often follow separate routes on a wide front and were small enough to live by foraging, allowing fewer supplies to be carried. Through dispersion and the use of forced marches the ''Grande Arm\u00e9e'' was often able to surprise opposing armies by its speed of manoeuver.<ref>{{cite book |title=The Utility of Force |last=Smith |first=Rupert |year=2005 |publisher=Penguin Books |location=London |isbn=978-0-14-102044-0 |pages=[https://archive.org/details/isbn_9780141020440/page/35 35\u201338] |url=https://archive.org/details/isbn_9780141020440/page/35 }}</ref> A Corps, depending on its size and the importance of its mission, was commanded by a marshal or ''G\u00e9n\u00e9ral de Division'' (major general).<ref>Kevin Kiley The Grand Quartier-General Imperial and the Corps d'Arm\u00e9e, Developments in the Military Art, 1795\u20131815, Part II: The Corps d'Arm\u00e9e [http://www.napoleon-series.org/military/organization/c_staff2.html]</ref>\n\nNapoleon placed great trust in his corps commanders and usually allowed them a wide freedom of action, provided they acted within the outlines of his strategic objectives and worked together to accomplish them. When they failed to do this to his satisfaction, however, he would not hesitate to reprimand or relieve them and in many cases took personal command of their corps himself. Corps were first formed in 1800, when General [[Jean Victor Marie Moreau|Moreau]] divided the [[Army of the Rhine]] into four corps. These were only temporary groupings, however, and it was not until 1804 that Napoleon made them permanent units. He would sometimes form the cavalry into separate corps, so they would be able to move and mass more quickly without being slowed by the infantry or foot artillery.{{Citation needed|date=February 2009}}\n\nThe main tactical units of the corps were the [[Division (military)|divisions]], usually consisting of 4,000 to 10,000 infantry or 2,000 to 4,000 cavalrymen. These in turn were made up of two or three [[brigade]]s of two [[regiment]]s apiece and supported by an [[artillery brigade]] of three or four [[Artillery battery|batteries]], each with six field [[cannon]]s and two [[howitzer]]s, making 24 to 32 guns in all. The divisions were also permanent administrative and operational units, commanded by a ''G\u00e9n\u00e9ral de Division'' and likewise capable of independent actions.{{Citation needed|date=February 2009}}\n\n==Forces of the ''Grande Arm\u00e9e''==\n\n===Imperial Guard===\n{{main|Imperial Guard (Napoleon I)}}\n\nThe [[Imperial Guard (Napoleon I)|Imperial Guard]] (''Garde Imp\u00e9riale'') was one of the most elite military forces of its time, and grew out of the ''Garde du Directoire'' and ''Garde Consulaire''.{{Citation needed|date=February 2009}} It formed a single ''Corps d'Arm\u00e9e'' with infantry, cavalry and artillery units like other corps, but with unique identities and uniforms. Napoleon also wanted it to be an example for the entire army to follow, and a force that, since it had fought with him over several campaigns, was completely loyal. Although the infantry was rarely committed en masse, the Guard's cavalry was often thrown into battle as the killing blow and its artillery used to pound enemies prior to assaults.{{Citation needed|date=February 2009}}\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+ Size of the Imperial Guard over time\n|-\n!

During the 1807 campaign in Poland, Napoleon gave the Grenadiers the nickname ''les grognards'' (the grumblers). They were the most experienced and bravest infantrymen in the Guard, some veterans having served in over 20 campaigns. To join the Grenadiers, a recruit had to have served for at least 10 years, have received a citation for bravery, be literate, and be over 178&nbsp;cm tall. The Old Guard were usually held in reserve for crucial moments on the battlefield, and unleashed to act as a hammer blow to a shaken enemy. For example, the ''1er R\u00e9giment de Grenadiers \u00e0 Pied'' saw heavy action at the [[Battle of Eylau]]. By 1815, the Old Guard grenadiers numbered four regiments, the 3e Grenadiers and 4e Grenadiers having been added in 1810 and 1815 respectively. The 2e, 3e and 4e Grenadiers were fully engaged at the Battle of Ligny, but two days later were defeated by the British as they advanced to in an attempt to smash the weakened British line at Waterloo. The two battalions of the 1er Grenadiers formed squares and fended off allied attacks to protect the general retreat. The ''Grenadiers \u00e0 Pied'' wore a dark blue ''habit long'' (coat with long tails) with red turnbacks, epaulettes, and white lapels. The most distinguishing feature of the Grenadiers was the tall [[bearskin]] hat, decorated with an engraved [[gold]] plate, a red [[hackle|plume]], and white cords.\n**'''Imperial Guard Foot ''Chasseurs'' (''Chasseurs \u00e0 Pied de la Garde Imp\u00e9riale'')''':<ref>[http://www.napoleon-series.org/military/organization/frenchguard/chasseurs/c_chasseursapied.html Uniforms of the Chasseurs-\u00e0-Pied de la Garde], Accessed March 16, 2006.</ref> The ''Chasseurs'' of the Guard were the second most senior regiment in the ''Grande Arm\u00e9e''.

The ''Chasseurs'' were in action in several crucial battles. Following Napoleon's return in 1815, the ''Chasseurs'' was expanded to four regiments also, with the 2e, 3e and 4e regiments being formed from recruits with only four years experience. These regiments also formed the assault of the Guard during the final phase of the Battle of Waterloo. The 2nd battalion of the 1st ''Chasseurs'' joined in the main attack of the Middle Guard, but were repulsed, while the second guarded the emperor's headquarters. The ''Chasseurs \u00e0 Pied'' wore a dark blue ''habit long'' with red turnbacks, red epaulettes fringed green, and white lapels. On campaign, the ''Chasseurs'' often wore dark blue trousers.

All members of the Middle Guard were veterans of 2\u20133 campaigns and were commissioned as NCOs in the line regiments. Arguably the best infantry of the entire Guard, the Fusiliers-''Chasseurs'' most often operated together with its sister formation, the Fusiliers-Grenadiers, as part of a Guard Fusilier-Brigade.

The battalion was formed with five ''\u00e9quipages'' (or crews), companies in all but name. After the cancellation of the invasion, the Marines remained a part of the Guard, manning whatever boat, [[barge]] or other water vessel Napoleon traveled in, as well as acting as a combat unit. Seamen of the Guard wore navy blue hussar-style [[dolman]] jackets, laced gold, and navy blue Hungarian style trousers decorated with gold lace.

Later its ranks would be filled almost entirely by select conscripts and volunteers.\n**'''''Tirailleurs''-Grenadiers''': In 1808, Napoleon ordered the most intelligent and strongest recruits to be formed into the first regiments of the Young Guard. The tallest of the recruits were inducted into the Tirailleurs-Grenadier regiments (renamed to Tirailleurs in 1810). All officers of the Tirailleurs-Grenadiers were drawn from the Old Guard, and as such were entitled to wear bearskins. The NCOs were drawn from the Middle Guard. Having this leavening of hardened veterans helped to increase the morale and combat abilities of the Tirailleurs-Grenadiers, and its sister formations the ''Tirailleurs-Chasseurs''. ''Tirailleurs''-Grenadiers wore a dark blue ''habit'' with red epaulettes, dark blue turnbacks, and lapels piped white. The Tirailleurs-Grenadiers' shako had red cords with a long red plume.\n** '''''Tirailleurs-Chasseurs''''': The shorter recruits of the Young Guard were inducted into the ''Tirailleurs-Chasseurs'' (renamed to ''Voltigeurs'' in 1810). The formation was identical to that of the ''Tirailleurs''-Grenadiers, with all officers being drawn from the Old Guard, and NCOs coming from the Middle Guard. ''Tirailleurs''-Grenadiers wore a dark blue ''habit'' with red turnbacks and dark blue lapels piped white. This was further decorated by green epaulettes with red fringing.

With Napoleon's first abdication, an ensign and 21 marines accompanied him to Elba, and returned with him for the Hundred Days campaign when their strength was increased to an ''equipage'' of 150 officers and men.\n\nThe marines were distinct in several ways from other ''Grande Arm\u00e9e'' units in that naval rather than army ranks were used, the uniform was based on that of those of the [[hussar]]s, and it was the only unit of the ''Grande Arm\u00e9e'' in which the musicians used both the [[drum]]s and the [[trumpet]]s.<ref>Head, Michael G.

A third regiment was added in 1806, the ''Regiment de Dragons de la Garde Imp\u00e9riale'' (Later known as the ''Dragons de l'Imperatice'', the Empress Dragoons). Following the campaign in Poland in 1807, a regiment of Polish [[lancer]]s, the ''Regiment de Chevau-L\u00e9gers de la Garde Imp\u00e9riale Polonais'' was added. The final addition was made in 1810, with another regiment of lancers, this time drawn from French and Dutch recruits, the ''2e Regiment de Chevau-L\u00e9gers Lanciers de la Garde Imp\u00e9riale'' or Red Lancers. The Cavalry of the Guard was involved in combat numerous times, and with few exceptions proved its worth in action.\n* '''[[Grenadiers \u00e0 Cheval de la Garde Imp\u00e9riale|Imperial Guard Horse Grenadiers (''Grenadiers \u00e0 Cheval de la Garde Imp\u00e9riale'')]]''': Known as the ''Gods'' or the ''Giants'', these troopers were the elite of Napoleon's Guard Cavalry and the mounted counterparts of the ''Grognards''. The Horse Grenadiers wore tall bearskin caps, dark blue coats and collars, white lapels, and tall boots. The entire formation was mounted on large black horses. A prospective recruit had to be over 176&nbsp;cm tall, have accrued 10 years of service serving in a minimum of four campaigns, and have received a citation for bravery. The Grenadiers performed admirably at Austerlitz, where they defeated the Russian Guard cavalry, but their most famous combat was at the Battle of Eylau. After standing under the fire of sixty Russian guns for a time, the troopers began to search for cover. Their commander, Colonel [[Louis Lepic]], ordered the troops, ''\"Up with your heads gentlemen, those are only bullets, not turds\"''.<ref>[http://www.napoleon-series.org/military/organization/c_eylau.html#4 \"Heads Up, By God!\" French Cavalry At Eylau, 1807 And Napoleon's Cavalry Doctrine], Accessed March 16, 2006.</ref> Soon after they joined Marshal Murat's charge into the Russian lines.

In their flamboyant green, red, and gold hussar style uniforms, the ''Chasseurs'' were known to exploit their position as the emperor's favourites, showing poor discipline and even insubordination on some occasions. They first saw combat during the Battle of Austerlitz, where they played a role in defeating the Russian Guard cavalry. During the Peninsular War, the ''Chasseurs'' were ambushed by a large British cavalry force at [[Benavente, Zamora|Benavente]] in 1808 and were defeated. They regained their reputation by showing extreme bravery during the Battle of Waterloo.{{Citation needed|date=February 2009}}\n* '''[[Gendarmes d'\u00e9lite de la Garde Imp\u00e9riale|Elite Gendarmes]] (''Gendarmerie d'Elite'')''': Nicknamed the ''Immortals'' because they rarely saw combat, the ''Gendarmes'' nonetheless performed a vital role. ''Gendarmes'' were the [[military police]] of the ''Grande Arm\u00e9e''. Along with maintaining security and order near the headquarters, the ''Gendarmes'' would provide honour guards for high-ranking visitors, interrogate prisoners, and protect the emperor's personal baggage. The ''Gendarmes'' wore dark blue coats with red lapels and tall boots, along with a bearskin cap slightly smaller than that of the Horse Grenadiers. After 1807, the ''Gendarmes'' began to see more combat, distinguishing themselves in guarding the Danube bridges at Aspern-Essling in 1809.{{Citation needed|date=February 2009}}\n* '''[[Squadron of Mamelukes]] (''Escadron de Mamelouks'')''': Fearsome desert warriors, whose loyalty Napoleon purchased during his Egyptian campaign. They combined superb horsemanship and swordsmanship with fanatical courage. Often romantically viewed as \"authentic sons of the desert\" or even \"head-hunters\", their officers were French, the NCOs and ranks comprising not only Egyptians and Turks, but also Greeks, Georgians, Syrians, and Cypriots as well, and even many of them were French. Originally they were an attached company (or \"Half-Squadron\") of the ''Chasseurs-a-Cheval de la Garde''. They distinguished themselves at Austerlitz in 1805, winning their own standard, a second trumpeter and promotion to full squadron. This unit eventually became part of the Old Guard, and served the emperor right up to Waterloo. In 1813, a second Mameluke company was raised and attached to the Young Guard. As with their predecessors, they were incorporated into the ''Chasseurs'', and served alongside them during the Hundred Days in 1815. By this time, the personnel being almost exclusively Frenchmen. Their distinct and colourful uniforms consisted of a green (later red) ''cahouk'' (hat), white turban, a loose shirt and a vest and red ''[[saroual]]'' (baggy trousers), with yellow, red, or tan boots. Their weapons consisted of a long, curved [[Scimitar]], a brace of pistols, and a dagger.

They were to be given French instructors and training. But during their first review before the emperor, their ranks became so entangled that Napoleon quipped, ''\"These people only know how to fight!\"'' and dismissed their instructors on the spot. But he kept his Polish cavalrymen by his side and the following year at [[Battle of Somosierra|Somosierra]] they would have another opportunity to prove themselves, on the battlefield instead of the parade ground. Napoleon ordered them to charge against a heavily fortified Spanish artillery position. Armed with only sabres and pistols, they overran four batteries, capturing over 20 cannons and decisively turned the tide. Following this, almost legendary, feat Napoleon proclaimed \"Poles, You are worthy of my Old Guard I proclaim you my bravest cavalry!\". Promoted to the Old Guard, they were then given lances, remained at the Emperor's side until Waterloo, and were never defeated by enemy cavalry. The 1e Regiment of the Guard developed a rivalry with their fellow Poles of the 1e Vistula Uhlans. This was not simply based on who was the better unit, but on deep political differences as well, with the lancers being fanatical Bonapartists, while many, if not most, of the uhlans held fiercely Republican sentiments. Such differences, political and otherwise, between units were not unusual and are well illustrated here. From being instructed by the French, they, along with their Vistula rivals, would go on to serve as instructors and models for the French and most other lancer regiments of the ''Grande Arm\u00e9e'', thus greatly multiplying their fearsome effectiveness.{{Citation needed|date=February 2009}}[[File:LancierRouge.jpg|right|thumb|A Red Lancer]]\n** '''[[2e r\u00e9giment de chevau-l\u00e9gers lanciers de la Garde Imp\u00e9riale|2nd Light Horse Regiment (French-Dutch)]]''': Formed in 1810 from a French and Dutch cadre. They were called ''Les Lanciers Rouges'' (the Red Lancers) due to their distinctive uniforms. They too suffered heavily in Russia at the hands of the Cossacks and the hardships of the winter, with most of its men and all but a handful of the horses lost. The regiment was rebuilt in 1813 and it became a powerful unit with its first four squadrons of veterans in the Old Guard and the new recruits of 6 junior squadrons in the Young Guard. They would distinguish themselves in numerous engagements, including Waterloo.\n** '''3rd Light Horse Regiment (Polish)''': Formed in 1812 as part of the Young Guard, its officers and NCOs were veterans, but its ranks were filled by enthusiastic yet inexperienced students and sons of Polish and Lithuanian landholders.

No more than 12 candidates from each of the 30 regular dragoon regiments were allowed to apply at any one call, this quota would later be reduced to 10. Volunteers from other guard regiments were also allowed to transfer. Since this was as much a ceremonial as a combat unit and was rarely committed in battle, billets in the Empress Dragoons were highly sought after positions. As with the Red Lancers, it had squadrons in both the Old and Young Guards and served with the emperor until the end.\n* '''[[Scouts of the Imperial Guard]] (''Eclaireurs de la Garde Imp\u00e9riale'')''': During the retreat from Moscow, Napoleon was highly impressed by the skills of many regiments of Cossacks. He used them as a model to create a new cavalry brigade, the Scouts, which were formed during the reorganisation of the Imperial Guard in December 1813. 3 regiments of a thousand men each were created and their squadrons attached to existing regiments:\n**'''1st Regiment''': ''scouts-grenadiers'' under Colonel-Major [[Claude Testot-Ferry]]'s command (wounded and titled Baron of the Empire by Napoleon himself on the battlefield of [[Battle of Craonne|Craonne]] on 7 March 1814)\n** '''2nd Regiment''': ''scouts-dragoons'' under Colonel Hoffmayer's command\n** '''3rd Regiment''': ''scouts-lanciers'' under Jean Kozietulski's command\nThe scouts had only the time to distinguish themselves during the defence of France in 1814 and were dissolved by King Louis XVIII upon the restoration of the Bourbon monarchy.\n\n===Infantry===\nWhile the [[infantry]] was perhaps not the most glamorous arm of service in the Grand Arm\u00e9e, they bore the brunt of most of the fighting, and their performance resulted in victory or defeat. The infantry was divided up into two major types, the Infantry of the Line (''Infanterie de Ligne'') and the Light Infantry (''Infanterie L\u00e9g\u00e8re'').\n\n====Line Infantry====\nThe [[line infantry]] made up the majority of the ''Grande Arm\u00e9e''. In 1803, Napoleon had reinstated the term \"regiment\", the revolutionary term \"[[demi-brigade]]\" (due to the fact there were two per brigade and it lacked the royal connotations) was now only used for provisional troops and depot units. At the time of the formation of the ''Grande Arm\u00e9e'', the French Army had 133 ''R\u00e9giments de Ligne'', a number which roughly corresponded with the number of ''[[Departments of France|d\u00e9partements]]'' in France. There would eventually be 156 ''Ligne'' regiments\n\nThe ''R\u00e9giments de Ligne'' varied in size throughout the Napoleonic Wars, but the basic building block of the ''Infanterie of the Line'' was the [[battalion]]. A line infantry battalion was numbered at about 840 men; however, this was the battalion's 'full strength' and few units ever reached this. A more typical strength for a battalion would be 400\u2013600 men. From 1800 to 1803, a line infantry battalion had eight fusilier companies and one grenadier company. From 1804 to 1807, a line infantry battalion had seven fusilier companies, one grenadier company, and one ''voltigeur'' company. From 1808 to 1815, a line infantry battalion had four companies of fusiliers, one company of grenadiers, and one company of ''voltigeurs''.

Newly formed battalions did not have a grenadier company; rather, Napoleon ordered that after two campaigns, several of the strongest, bravest, and tallest fusiliers were to be promoted to a grenadier company, so each line battalion which had seen more than two campaigns had one company of grenadiers.\n\nRegulations required that grenadier recruits were to be the tallest, most fearsome men in the regiments, and all were to have [[moustache]]s. To add to this, grenadiers were initially equipped with a ''bonnet \u00e0 poil'' or bearskin, as well as red [[epaulette]]s on their coat. After 1807, regulations stipulated that line grenadiers were to replace their bearskin with a shako lined red with a red plume; however, many chose to retain their bearskins. In addition to the standard Charleville model 1777 and bayonet, grenadiers were also equipped with a short [[sabre]]. This was to be used for close combat, but most often ended up serving as a tool to cut wood for campfires.\n\nA grenadier company would usually be situated on the right side of a formation, traditionally the place of greatest honour since the days of [[hoplite]] warfare in which a corps' right flank had less protection from the shield line of its formation. During a campaign, grenadier companies could be detached to form a grenadier battalion or occasionally a regiment or brigade. These formations would then be used as a shock force or the [[Vanguard (military formation)|vanguard]] for a larger formation.\n\n=====[[Voltigeur|''Voltigeurs'']] of the Line=====\n''Voltigeurs'' (literally, ''Vaulters'' or ''Leapers'') were elite light infantry of the line regiments. In 1805, Napoleon ordered that the smallest, most agile men of the line battalions be chosen to form a ''voltigeur'' company. These troops were to be second only to the grenadiers in the battalion hierarchy. Their name comes from their original mission. ''Voltigeurs'' were to vault upon horses of friendly cavalry for faster movement, an idea which proved impractical if not outright impossible. Despite this, the ''voltigeurs'' did perform a valuable task, [[skirmish]]ing and providing scouts for each battalion, as well as providing an organic light infantry component for each line regiment. In ''voltigeur'' training, emphasis was placed on marksmanship and quick movement.\n\n''Voltigeurs'' were equipped with large yellow and green or yellow and red plumes for their bicornes. After 1807, their shakos were lined with yellow and carried similar plumes. They also had yellow epaulettes lined green and a yellow collar on their coats.\n\nOriginally, ''voltigeurs'' were to be equipped with the short dragoon musket, however in practice, they were equipped with the Charleville model 1777 and bayonet. Like grenadiers, ''voltigeurs'' were equipped with a short sabre for close combat, and like grenadiers this was rarely used. ''Voltigeur'' companies could be detached and formed into regiments or brigades to create a light infantry formation. After 1808, the ''voltigeur'' company was situated on the left of the line when in combat. This was traditionally the second highest position of honour in the line of battle.\n\n===== [[Fusilier]]s =====\n[[File:LineInfantry1812.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Fusiliers of the line, {{circa|1812}}]]\n\nThe fusiliers made up the majority of a line infantry battalion, and may be considered the typical infantryman of the ''Grande Arm\u00e9e''. Fusiliers were armed with a [[smoothbore]], [[muzzle (firearms)|muzzle]]-loaded [[flintlock]] Charleville model 1777 musket and a bayonet. Fusilier training placed emphasis on speed of march and endurance, along with individually aimed fire at close range and close quarters combat. This differed greatly from the training given to the majority of European armies, which emphasised moving in rigid formations and firing massed volleys. Many of the early Napoleonic victories were due to the ability of the French armies to cover long distances with speed, and this ability was thanks to the training given to the infantry. From 1803, each battalion comprised eight fusilier companies. Each company numbered around 120 men.\n\nIn 1805, one of the fusilier companies was dissolved and reformed as a ''voltigeur'' company. In 1808, Napoleon reorganised the infantry battalion from nine to six companies. The new companies were to be larger, comprising 140 men, and four of these were to be made up of fusiliers, one of grenadiers, and one of ''voltigeurs''.\n\nThe fusiliers wore a bicorne, until this was superseded by the shako in 1807. The uniform of a fusilier consisted of white trousers, white surcoat and a dark blue coat (the ''habit long'' model until 1812, thereafter the ''habit veste'') with white lapels, red collar and cuffs. Each eusilier wore a coloured [[pom-pom]] on his hat. The colour of this pom-pom changed depending on the company the man belonged to, as military uniforms reached their excessive pinnacle at around this period in time. After the 1808 reorganisation, the first company was issued with a dark green pom-pom, the second with sky blue, the third with orange and the fourth with violet.\n\n====Light Infantry====\nWhile the infantry of the line made up the majority of the ''Grande Arm\u00e9e''<nowiki/>'s infantry, the ''Infanterie L\u00e9g\u00e8re'' ([[Light Infantry]]) also played an important role. The ''L\u00e9g\u00e8re'' regiments never numbered more than 36 (compared with the 133 of the ''Ligne'' regiments), and the ''Ligne'' could perform all the same manoeuvres, including skirmishes. The difference laid in the training and the resulting high ''[[esprit de corps]]''.\n\nTraining for ''L\u00e9g\u00e8re'' units placed strong emphasis on marksmanship and fast movement. As a result, the general ''L\u00e9g\u00e8re'' soldier was able to shoot more accurately and move faster than his ''Ligne'' counterpart. ''L\u00e9g\u00e8re'' regiments tended to see more action and were often used to screen large manoeuvres. Naturally, because commanders turned to the ''L\u00e9g\u00e8re'' for more missions than the ''Ligne'', the ''L\u00e9g\u00e8re'' troopers enjoyed a higher esprit de corps and were known for their flamboyant uniforms and attitude. Also, ''L\u00e9g\u00e8re'' troops were required to be shorter than line troops, which helped them to move quickly through forests as well as to hide behind obstacles when skirmishing. The formation of a ''L\u00e9g\u00e8re'' battalion exactly mirrored that of a line infantry battalion, but different troop types were substituted for the grenadiers, fusiliers and ''voltigeurs''.\n\n===== ''Carabiniers-\u00e0-Pied'' =====\nThe carabiniers were the grenadiers of the ''L\u00e9g\u00e8re'' battalions. After two campaigns, the tallest and bravest ''chasseurs'' were chosen to join a carabinier company. They performed as elite shock troops for the battalion. As with the grenadiers, carabiniers were required to wear moustaches. They were armed with the Charleville model 1777, a bayonet, and a short sabre. The carabinier uniform consisted of a tall bearskin cap (superseded in 1807 by a red trimmed shako with a red plume). They wore the same uniform as the ''chasseurs'', but with red epaulettes. Carabinier companies could be detached to form larger all carabinier formations for assaults or other operations requiring assault troops.\n\n===== Light ''Voltigeurs''=====\n''Voltigeurs'' performed exactly the same mission in the ''L\u00e9g\u00e8re'' battalion as they did in the line battalions, only they were more nimble and better marksmen. The ''L\u00e9g\u00e8re'' ''voltigeurs'' were dressed as ''chasseurs'', but with yellow and green epaulettes and before 1806, a ''colpack'' (or [[Busby (military headdress)|busby]]) replaced the shako. The colpack had a large yellow over red plume and green cords. After 1807, a shako replaced the colpack, with a large yellow plume and yellow lining. As with the line ''voltigeurs'', ''l\u00e9g\u00e8re'' ''voltigeurs'' could be detached and used to form larger formations as needed.\n\n=====[[Chasseur|''Chasseurs'']]=====\n''Chasseurs'' (''Hunters'') were the fusiliers of the ''L\u00e9g\u00e8re'' battalions. They made up the majority of the formation. They were armed with the Charleville model 1777 musket and a bayonet, and also with a short sabre for close combat. As was common in the ''Grande Arm\u00e9e'', this weapon was quickly blunted by being used to chop wood for fires.\n\nFrom 1803, each battalion comprising eight ''chasseur'' companies. Each company numbered around 120 men. In 1808, Napoleon reorganised the infantry battalion from nine to six companies. The new companies were to be larger, comprising 140 men, and four of these were to be made up of ''chasseurs''.\n\nThe ''chasseurs'' had far more ornate uniforms than their contemporaries the fusiliers. Until 1806, they were equipped with a cylindrical shako with a large dark green plume and decorated with white cords. Their uniform was a darker blue than that of the line regiments, to aid with camouflage while skirmishing. Their coat was similar to that of the line troops, but their lapels and cuffs were also dark blue, and it featured dark green and red epaulettes. They also wore dark blue trousers and high imitation hussar boots. After 1807, the cylindrical shako was replaced with the standard shako, but was still embellished by white cords. As with the line fusiliers, ''chasseur'' companies were distinguished by coloured pom-poms, but the colours for the different companies changed from regiment to regiment.\n\n<gallery class=\"center\" mode=\"packed\" heights=\"200\">\nFile:Grenadier1812.jpg|A grenadier of the line, {{circa|1812}}\nFile:Lightinfnap.jpg|Officers of ''Infanterie L\u00e9g\u00e8re'', 1803\u20131815\nFile:Legere-Chasseur.jpg|''Chasseurs'' of ''Infanterie L\u00e9g\u00e8re'', 1806 \n</gallery>\n\n===Cavalry===\nBy decree of the emperor himself, cavalry typically were between a fifth and a sixth of the ''Grande Arm\u00e9e''. Cavalry regiments of 800\u20131,200 men were made up of three or four escadrons of two companies each, plus supporting elements. In [[light cavalry]] and dragoon regiments, the first company of every regiment's first escadron, was always designated as 'elite', with presumably, the best men and horses. In the revolution's wake, the cavalry suffered the greatest from the loss of experienced aristocratic officers and NCOs still loyal to the ''[[Ancien R\u00e9gime]]''. Consequently, the quality of French cavalry drastically declined. Napoleon rebuilt the branch, turning it into arguably the finest in the world. Until 1812, it was undefeated in any large engagements above the regimental level. There were two primary types of cavalry for different roles, [[Heavy cavalry|heavy]] and light.\n[[File:Bataille Waterloo 1815 reconstitution 2011 2.jpg|thumb|upright=3|center|Sample of the cavalry of the ''Grande Arm\u00e9e'' during a [[Historical reenactment|reenactment]] of the [[Battle of Waterloo]]]]\n\n====Heavy cavalry====\n\n===== ''[[Carabiniers-\u00e0-Cheval]]'' (Horse Carabiners) =====\nThe elite among all French heavy cavalry line formations, the two regiments of mounted carabiniers had a very similar appearance with the mounted grenadiers of the Imperial Guard; bearskins, long blue coats, etc. and were mounted exclusively on black horses prior to 1813. They were largely used in identical manner to the Cuirassiers, but being (initially) unarmored, they were less suited for close-quarters, [[melee]] combat. Unarmored heavy cavalry was the norm in Europe during most of the Napoleonic Wars, with the French being the first to reintroduce the back-and-breastplate. In 1809, appalled by their mauling at the hands of Austrian uhlans, Napoleon ordered that they be given armour. The carabinier's refusal to copy the less elite cuirassiers resulted in them being given special armor, with their helmets and cuirasses being sheathed in bronze for added visual effect. But this did not prevent them from being defeated by Russian cuirassiers at Borodino in 1812, and panicking before Hungarian hussars at Leipzig the following year.\n\n===== [[Cuirassier]]s =====\nThe heavy cavalry, wearing a heavy ''[[cuirass]]'' (breastplate) and helmets of brass and iron and armed with straight long sabers, pistols, and later [[carbine]]s. Like medieval knights, they served as mounted [[shock troops]]. Because of the weight of their armour and weapons, both the trooper and the horse had to be big and strong, and could put a lot of force behind their charge. Though the ''cuirass'' could not protect against direct musket fire, it could deflect ricochets and shots from long range, and offered some protection from pistol shots. More importantly, the breastplates protected against the swords and lances of opposing cavalry. Napoleon often combined together all of his cuirassiers and carabiniers into a cavalry reserve, to be used at the decisive moment of the battle. In this manner, they proved to be an extremely potent force on the battlefield. The British, in particular, who mistakenly believed the cuirassiers were Napoleon's bodyguard, and would later come to adapt their distinctive helmets and breastplates for their own [[Household Cavalry]]. There were originally 25 cuirassier regiments, reduced to 12 by Napoleon initially who later added three more. At the beginning of his rule, most of the cuirassier regiments were severely understrength, so Napoleon ordered the best men and horses to be allocated to the first 12 regiments, while the rest were reorganised into dragoons.\n\n===== [[Dragoon]]s =====\nThe medium-weight mainstays of the French cavalry, although considered heavy cavalry, who were used for battle, skirmishing, and scouting. They were highly versatile being armed not only with distinctive straight swords, but also muskets with bayonets enabling them to fight as infantry as well as mounted, though fighting on foot had become increasingly uncommon for dragoons of all armies in the decades preceding Napoleon. The versatility of a dual-purpose soldier came at the cost of their horsemanship and swordsmanship often not being up to the same standards as those of other cavalry. Finding enough large horses proved a challenge. Some infantry officers were even required to give up their mounts for the dragoons, creating resentment towards them from this branch as well. There were 25, later 30, dragoon regiments. In 1815, only 15 could be raised and mounted in time for the Waterloo campaign.\n\n====Light cavalry====\n\n===== [[Hussar|Hussars]] =====\nThese fast, light cavalrymen were the eyes, ears, and egos of the Napoleonic armies. They regarded themselves as the best horsemen and swordsmen (''beau sabreurs'') in the entire ''Grande Arm\u00e9e''. This opinion was not entirely unjustified and their flamboyant uniforms reflected their panache. Tactically, they were used for [[reconnaissance]], skirmishing, and screening for the army to keep their commanders informed of enemy movements while denying the enemy the same information and to pursue fleeing enemy troops. Armed only with curved sabres and pistols, they had reputations for reckless bravery to the point of being almost suicidal. It was said by their most famous commander [[Antoine Lasalle]] that a hussar who lived to be 30 was truly an old guard and very fortunate. Lasalle was killed at the Battle of Wagram at age 34. There were 10 regiments in 1804, with an 11th added in 1810 and two more in 1813.\n\n===== ''Chasseurs-\u00e0-Cheval'' (Mounted Hunters) =====\nThese were light cavalry identical to hussars in arms and role. But, unlike the ''chasseurs'' of the Imperial Guard and their infantry counterparts, they were considered less prestigious or elite. Their uniforms were less colourful as well, consisting of infantry-style shakos (in contrast to the fur busby worn by some French hussars), green coats, green breeches, and short boots. They were, however, the most numerous of the light cavalry, with 31 regiments in 1811, 6 of which comprised Flemish, Swiss, Italians and Germans.\n\n===== [[Lancer]]s =====\nSome of the most feared cavalry in the ''Grande Arm\u00e9e'' were the Polish lancers of the Vistula Uhlans. Nicknamed ''Hell's Picadors'' or ''Los Diablos Polacos'' (The Polish Devils) by the Spanish, these medium and light horse (''[[Chevau-l\u00e9gers|Chevau-L\u00e9gers]] Lanciers'') cavalry had near equal speed to the hussars, shock power almost as great as the cuirassiers, and were nearly as versatile as the dragoons. They were armed with, as their name indicates, lances along with sabres and pistols. Initially, French ministers of war insisted on arming all lancers identically. Real battlefield experience, however, proved that the Polish way of arming only the first line with lance while the second rank carried carbines instead was much more practical and thus was adopted. Lancers were the best cavalry for charging against infantry squares, where their lances could outreach the infantry's bayonets, (as was the case with Colborne's British brigade at [[Battle of Albuera#Destruction of Colborne's brigade|Albuera]] in 1811) and also in hunting down a routed enemy. Their ability to scour and finish off the wounded without ever stepping off their saddle created perfect scenes of horror for the enemy. They could be deadly against other types of cavalry as well, most famously demonstrated by the fate of [[William Ponsonby (British Army officer)|Sir William Ponsonby]] and his [[Royal Scots Greys#Waterloo|Scots Greys]] at Waterloo. Excluding those of the Guard, there were 9 lancer regiments.\n\n<gallery class=\"center\" mode=\"packed\" heights=\"180px\">\nImage:Napoleon Carabiner of 1812 by Bellange.jpg|A ''[[Carabiniers-\u00e0-Cheval]]''\nImage:Dragoon of the 21\u00e9r Regiment de Dragons.jpg|A dragoon officer of the ''21\u00e8me R\u00e9giment de Dragons''\nFile:Edouard Detaille - Vive L'Empereur - Google Art Project.jpg|[[4th Hussar Regiment (France)|French 4th Hussars]] at the [[Battle of Friedland]]\nImage:Lancer.jpg|A lancer of the ''R\u00e9giment de la Vistule Uhlans''\n</gallery>\n\n=== Artillery ===\nThe emperor was a former [[artillery]] officer, and reportedly said ''\"God fights on the side with the best artillery.\"''<ref name=artillery>Mas, M.A. M., p. 81.</ref> As such, French cannons were the backbone of the ''Grande Arm\u00e9e'', possessing the greatest firepower of the three arms and hence the ability to inflict the most casualties in the least amount of time. The French guns were often used in massed batteries (or [[Grand Battery|''grandes batteries'']]) to soften up enemy formations before being subjected to the closer attention of the infantry or cavalry. Superb gun-crew training allowed Napoleon to move the weapons at great speed to either bolster a weakening defensive position, or else hammer a potential break in enemy lines.\n\nBesides superior training, Napoleon's artillery was also greatly aided by the numerous technical improvements to French cannons by [[Jean-Baptiste Vaquette de Gribeauval|Jean Baptiste de Gribeauval]] which made them lighter, faster, and much easier to sight, as well as strengthened the carriages and introduced standard sized calibres. In general, French guns were 4-[[pound (mass)|pounders]], 8-pounders, or 12-pounders and {{convert|6|in|mm|adj=on}} [[howitzers]] with the lighter calibres being phased out and replaced by 6-pounders later in the Napoleonic Wars. French cannons had brass barrels and their carriages, wheels, and limbers were painted olive-green. Superb organisation fully integrated the artillery into the infantry and cavalry units it supported, yet also allowed it to operate independently if the need arose. There were two basic types, ''Artillerie \u00e0 pied'' (foot artillery) and ''Artillerie \u00e0 cheval'' (horse artillery).\n\n====Foot artillery====\nAs the name indicates, these gunners marched alongside their guns, which were, of course, pulled by horses when limbered (undeployed). Hence, they travelled at the infantry's pace or slower. In 1805, there were eight, later ten, regiments of foot artillery in the ''Grande Arm\u00e9e'' plus two more in the Imperial Guard, but unlike cavalry and infantry regiments, these were administrative organisations. The main operational and tactical units were the batteries (or companies) of 120 men each, which were formed into brigades and assigned to the divisions and corps.\n* Divisional artillery: Every division had a brigade of three or four batteries of 8 guns (six cannons and two howitzers) each.\n* Corps artillery reserve: Each corps would also have its own artillery reserve, of one of more brigades, armed mostly with the larger, heavier calibre pieces.\n\nBattery personnel included not only gun crews, NCOs, and officers, but drummers, trumpeters, metal workers, woodworkers, ouvriers, furriers, and artificers. They would be responsible for fashioning spare parts, maintaining and repairing the guns, carriages, caissons and wagons, as well as tending the horses and storing munitions.\n\n====Horse artillery====\n[[File:Detaille - Artillerie \u00e0 cheval de la Garde Imperiale.jpg|thumb|upright|A gunner from the horse artillery of the Imperial Guard]]\nThe cavalry were supported by the fast moving, fast firing light guns of the horse artillery. This arm was a hybrid of cavalry and artillery with their crews riding either on the horses or on the carriages into battle. Because they operated much closer to the front lines, the officers and crews were better armed and trained for close quarters combat, mounted or dismounted much as were the dragoons. Once in position, they were trained to quickly dismount, unlimber (deploy), and sight their guns, then fire rapid barrages at the enemy. They could then quickly limber (undeploy) the guns, remount, and move on to a new position. To accomplish this, they had to be the best trained and most elite of all artillerymen. The horse batteries of the Imperial Guard could go from riding at full gallop to firing their first shot in just under a minute. After witnessing such a performance, an astounded [[Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington|Duke of Wellington]] remarked, ''\"They move their cannon as if it were a pistol!\"'' There were 6 administrative regiments of horse artillery plus one in the Guard. In addition to the batteries assigned to the cavalry units, Napoleon would also assign at least one battery to each infantry corps or, if available, to each division. Their abilities came at a price, however, as horse batteries were very expensive to raise and maintain. Consequently, they were far fewer in number than their foot counterparts, typically constituting only one fifth of the artillery's strength. It was a boastful joke among their ranks that the emperor knew every horse gunner by name. Besides better training, horses, weapons, and equipment, they used far more ammunition. Horse batteries were given twice the ammo ration of the foot, three times that of the Guard.\n\n====Ammunition====\nOf all the types of ammunition used in the Napoleonic Wars, the cast iron, spherical, [[round shot]] was the staple of the gunner. Even at long range when the shot was travelling relatively slowly it could be deadly, though it might appear to be bouncing or rolling along the ground relatively gently. At short range, carnage could result.<ref name=\"McNab145\">McNab, p. 145.</ref>\n\nRound shots were undeniably inaccurate. This was because, despite their name, round shots were never perfectly spherical, nor did they fit their gun barrels exactly. Air acted on the irregular surface of the projectile. These irregularities invariably threw them off target to some degree. It is often also a matter of confusion as to why a 12pdr shot was so much more effective than a 6pdr shot. This is because the impact of a shot was not only related to its weight but also to its [[velocity]], which, with a heavier projectile, was much greater at the end of the trajectory.<ref name=\"McNab145\"/>\n\nThere were two forms of close-range weapons, which were extremely useful at up to 270m (300 yards). [[Grapeshot]] and [[Canister shot|canister]], or case, were the anti-personnel weapons of choice of the gunner. Grape was a cluster of large metal spheres tied together around a central spindle and base and normally sewn into a bag, whereas canister was a metal case filled with smaller iron or lead spheres. The whole purpose of these types of shot was to break up when fired from the gun forming a wide cone of flying metal that acted in the same way as a [[shotgun]] [[Cartridge (firearms)|cartridge]].<ref>McNab, p. 145\u201346.</ref>\n\nFor longer-range anti-personnel work, the common [[Shell (projectile)|shell]] was also used. This was normally only fired from a [[Mortar (weapon)|mortar]] or howitzer and was a hollow sphere filled with [[gunpowder]] charge. The top of the shell had thinner walls than the bottom and had an orifice into which was forced a wooden [[Fuse (explosives)|fuse]] normally made of [[beech]] wood. The fuse was designed to be ignited by the discharge of the gun and had a central channel drilled through it and filled with a burning compound. Before firing, the fuse was cut to a certain length corresponding to the desired time of burning and hammered into the top of the shell by a mallet. When it arrived over the target, the fuse, if correctly prepared, exploded the main charge, breaking open the metal outer casing and forcing flying fragments in all directions. Although favoured for [[siege]] work, the common shell was not always effective against infantry.<ref name=\"McNab146\">McNab, p. 146.</ref>\n\nThe final type of projectile for the field artillery used by the French was the incendiary or [[Carcass (projectile)|carcass]] (a name for an incendiary projectile). Initially, this device was composed of a metal frame, which was covered with a canvas cover and filled with a special recipe, typically 50 [[Potassium nitrate|saltpetre]] parts, 25 [[sulfur]] parts, 8 [[rosin]] parts, 5 [[antimony]] parts, and 5 [[Pitch (resin)|pitch]] parts. However, during the early 19th century, another form of carcass became common and this took the form of a common shell with two or three apertures in its exterior into which a similar composition was put. Carcass rounds were normally issued only to howitzers or mortars, the suggestion being they were intended to attack towns. This does not preclude them from being used on the field, but quite what their purpose would have been there is not clear.<ref>McNab, p. 147.</ref>\n\nIt is important to know that not all nations shared the same types of artillery projectiles. For example, the [[Congreve rocket]], inspired from the [[Mysore]]an [[rocket artillery]], or the [[shrapnel shell]], which combined the killing effect of grapeshot with the ranges achieved by round shot, were used only by the [[British Army during the Napoleonic Wars|British Army]].<ref name=\"McNab146\"/>\n\n====Artillery train====\n[[File:Gribeauval artillery train.jpg|thumb|A [[Jean-Baptiste Vaquette de Gribeauval|Gribeauval]] artillery [[Limbers and caissons|caisson]] on display at the ''[[Mus\u00e9e de l'Arm\u00e9e]]'', Paris]]\nThe ''train d'artillerie'', was established by Napoleon in January 1800. Its function was to provide the teamsters and drivers which handled the horses that hauled the artillery's vehicles.<ref>Elting, John R.: \"Swords Around A Throne\", p. 250, Da Capo Press, 1997</ref> Prior to this, the French, like all other period armies, had employed contracted, civilian teamsters who would sometimes abandon the guns under fire, rendering them immobile, rather than risk their lives or their valuable teams of horses.<ref name=Elting2>Elting, John R.:\"Swords Around A Throne\", pp. 254\u201355, Da Capo Press, 1997</ref> Its personnel, unlike their civilian predecessors, were armed, trained, and uniformed as soldiers. Apart from making them look better on parade, this made them subject to military discipline and capable of fighting back if attacked. The drivers were armed with a carbine, a short sword of the same type used by the infantry, and a pistol. They needed little encouragement to use these weapons, earning surly reputations for gambling, brawling, and various forms of mischief. Their uniforms and coats of grey helped enhance their tough appearance. But their combativeness could prove useful as they often found themselves attacked by Cossacks and Spanish and Tyrolian guerillas.\n\nEach ''train d'artillerie'' battalion was originally composed of 5 companies. The first company was considered elite and assigned to a horse artillery battery; the three \"centre\" companies were assigned to the foot artillery batteries and \"parks\" (spare caissons, field forges, supply wagons, etc.); and one became a depot company for training recruits and remounts. Following the campaigns of 1800, the train was re-organised into eight battalions of six companies each. As Napoleon enlarged his artillery, additional battalions were created, rising to a total of fourteen in 1810. In 1809, 1812, and 1813 the first thirteen battalions were \"doubled\" to create 13 additional battalions. Additionally, after 1809 some battalions raised extra companies to handle the regimental guns attached to the infantry.<ref name=Elting2/>\n\nThe Imperial Guard had its own train, which expanded as ''La Garde'''s artillery park was increased, albeit organised as regiments rather than battalions. At their zenith, in 1813\u201314, the Old Guard artillery was supported by a 12-company regiment while the Young Guard had a 16-company regiment, one for each of their component artillery batteries.<ref>Elting, John R.:\"Swords Around A Throne\", pp. 186, 194, Da Capo Press, 1997</ref>\n\n=== Foreign troops in the ''Grande Arm\u00e9e''===\n[[File:Prince Joseph Poniatowski by J\u00f3zef Grassi.jpg|thumb|upright|right|[[J\u00f3zef Poniatowski]], a Polish general and prince of the [[Duchy of Warsaw]] who served with the ''Grande Arm\u00e9e'' from 1807 to 1813, and was later made a [[Marshal of the Empire]] at the [[Battle of Leipzig]]]]\n{{See also|V Corps (Grande Arm\u00e9e)}}\nMany European armies recruited foreign troops, and France was no exception. Foreign troops played an important role and fought with distinction in the ''Grande Arm\u00e9e'' during the Napoleonic Wars. Almost every continental European country was, at different stages, a part of the ''Grande Arm\u00e9e''. By the end of the conflict, tens-of-thousands had served. In 1805, 35,000 troops from France's allies were used to protect lines of communications and flanks of the main army. In 1806, 27,000 more troops were called up for similar purposes, plus 20,000 Saxon troops who were used for mopping up operations against the Prussians. In the winter of 1806\u20137, Germans, Poles, and Spaniards helped seize the Baltic ports of [[Stralsund]] and [[Danzig]] on the army's left flank. At the Battle of Friedland in 1807, Marshal Lannes' corps was formed considerably from Poles, Saxons, and Dutch. For the first time, foreign troops had played a role in a major battle, and done so with distinction. During the War of the Fifth Coaltion, as many as one-third of the ''Grande Arm\u00e9e'', were from the Confederation of the Rhine,<ref name=Elting01b>Elting, John R. ''Swords Around A Throne''. Da Capo Press, 1997. P. 387.</ref> and one-quarter of the Army in Italy was Italian. At the ''Grande Arm\u00e9e''<nowiki/>'s peak in 1812, more than one-third of the troops that marched into Russia were non-French and represented 20 different countries, including Austria and Prussia. [[Julius von Grawert|Grawert]] initially led the Prussian detachment, but was replaced by [[Ludwig Yorck von Wartenburg|Yorck]].\n\n== Support services ==\n\n===Engineers===\n[[File:Lawrence Alma-Tadema 12.jpeg|thumb|250px|Dutch sappers of the ''Grande Arm\u00e9e'' during the [[Battle of Berezina]] in 1812]]\n[[File:Sapeur-23RIL.jpg|thumb|upright|A French pioneer during the Napoleonic Wars]]\n\nWhile the glory of battle went to the cavalry, infantry, and artillery, the army also included [[military engineer]]s of various types.\n\nThe bridge builders of the ''Grande Arm\u00e9e'', the ''pontonniers'', were an indispensable part of Napoleon's military machine. Their main contribution was helping the emperor to get his forces across water obstacles by erecting [[pontoon bridge]]s. The skills of his pontonniers allowed Napoleon to outflank enemy positions by crossing rivers where the enemy least expected and, in the case of the great retreat from Moscow, saved the army from complete annihilation at the Berezina River.\n\nThey may not have had the glory, but Napoleon clearly valued his ''pontonniers'' and had 14 companies commissioned into his armies, under the command of the brilliant engineer, General [[Jean Baptiste Ebl\u00e9]]. His training, along with their specialized tools and equipment, enabled them to quickly build the various parts of the bridges, which could then be rapidly assembled and reused later. All the needed materials, tools, and parts were carried on their wagon trains. If they did not have a part or item, it could be quickly made using the mobile wagon-mounted forges of the ''pontonniers''. A single company of ''pontonniers'' could construct a bridge of up to 80 pontoons (a span of some 120 to 150 metres long) in just under seven hours, an impressive feat even by today's standards.\n\nIn addition to the ''pontonniers'', there were companies of [[sapper]]s, to deal with enemy fortifications. They were used far less often in their intended role than the ''pontonniers''. However, since the emperor had learned in his early campaigns (such as the [[Siege of Acre (1799)|Siege of Acre]]) that it was better to bypass and isolate fixed fortifications, if possible, than to directly assault them, the sapper companies were usually put to other tasks.\n\nThe different types of engineer companies were formed into battalions and regiments called [[:fr:G\u00e9nie militaire|''G\u00e9nie'']], which was originally a [[Grande Arm\u00e9e slang|slang]] term for engineer. This name, which is still used today, was both a play on the word (''jeu de mot'') and a reference to their seemingly magical abilities to grant wishes and make things appear much like the mythical [[Genie]].\n\n===Logistics===\nOne of Napoleon's most quoted lines is his dictum that \"An army is a creature which marches on its stomach\", illustrating the vital importance of [[military logistics]]. The troops of the ''Grande Arm\u00e9e'' each carried four days' provisions. The supply wagon trains following them carried eight days', but these were to be consumed only in emergency. One man was allotted to 750 grams of bread, 550 grams of biscuits, 250 grams of meat, 30 grams of rice, and 60 grams of grain; one liter of wine was shared between four men. Insofar as possible, Napoleon encouraged his men to live off the land through foraging and requisition of food (which was known as ''[[La Maraude]]''). An integral part of the French logistics system was the inclusion in every regiment of several women known as ''cantini\u00e8res'' (also known as ''vivandi\u00e8res'', but ''cantini\u00e8re'' was by far the more common term among French troops). These women were married to soldiers in their regiments, and acted as sutlers, selling food and drink (especially alcohol) to the troops. They were considered \"absolutely necessary\" to the functioning of the army, and the Consular Decree of 7 Thermidor, Year VIII set their number at four per battalion and two per cavalry squadron.<ref>Cardoza, Thomas. ''Intrepid Women: Cantini\u00e8res and Vivandi\u00e8res of the French Army,'' Bloomington: Indiana University Press, 2010, 60-61.</ref> These women fed the troops when all other logistical arrangements broke down.\n\nAdditional supplies would be stockpiled and stored at forward bases and depots which Napoleon would establish before the start of his campaigns. These would then be moved forward as the army advanced. The supply bases of the ''Grande Arm\u00e9e'' would replenish the corps and divisional depots, which in turn would replenish the brigade and regimental supply trains, which would distribute rations and ammunition to the troops as needed to supplement their foraging. The reliance on foraging was sometimes determined by political pressures. When marching over friendly territory armies were told to \"live off what the country can supply\", but when marching over neutral territory they were issued with supplies. It was this system of planned and improvised logistics which enabled the ''Grande Arm\u00e9e'' to sustain rapid marches of up to 15 miles per day for up to five weeks. The logistical system was also aided by a technological innovation in the form of the food preservation technique invented by [[Nicolas Appert]], which led to modern [[canning]] methods.\n\n=== Medical Staff ===\n[[File:Ambulance of the French Army.jpg|thumb|The Flying Ambulances were developed by French battlefield surgeon Dominque-Jean Larrey to rapidly transport the wounded from the battlefield to field hospitals.]]\nThe medical services had the least glory or prestige, but were required to deal with the full horrors of the war's aftermath. The technology and practice of military medicine did not advance significantly during the Napoleonic Wars, but the ''Grande Arm\u00e9e'' did benefit from improvements in organisation and mobility. The established practice was for the wounded to be collected and treated after the battle had ended, by which time many wounded soldiers would have died. The systems adopted by the French Army in the Revolutionary and Napoleonic period were the forerunners of almost all modern military ambulance and triage systems, being adopted by the armies of most other Western nations in the following decades.\n\nThe most significant innovation was the establishment of a system of ''ambulances volantes'' (flying ambulances) in the closing years of the 18th century by [[Dominique Jean Larrey]] (who would later become Surgeon-General of the Imperial Guard). His inspiration was the use of fast horse artillery, or \"flying artillery\", which could manoeuver rapidly around the battlefield to provide urgent artillery support, or to escape an advancing enemy. The flying ambulance was designed to follow the advance guard and provide initial dressing of wounds (often under fire), while rapidly transporting the critically injured away from the battlefield. The personnel for a given ambulance team included a doctor, quartermaster, non-commissioned officer, a drummer boy (who carried the bandages), and 24 infantrymen as stretcher bearers.<ref>http://www.uwomj.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/2012_ER_Chan.pdf</ref>\n\nAnother French military surgeon, Baron L.P. Percy, implemented another system. He was the first to introduce \"a regularly trained corps of field litter bearers, soldiers regularly formed and equipped for the duty of picking up the wounded... and carrying them on stretchers to the place where means of surgical aid were provided\". Percy's system essentially served as a method of moving surgeons and their instruments closer to the engaged forces from where stretcher bearers would retrieve the wounded, rather than placing an emphasis on evacuating the wounded to the rear in a vehicle.\n\nDuring the Napoleonic Wars, every French regiment, division, and corps had its own medical staff, consisting of ambulance units, orderlies to perform nursing duties, apothecaries, surgeons, and doctors. Larrey was instrumental in reorganising military hospitals and making them more mobile. This was more than any other army would be able to offer until the 1850s and 1860s, half a century later. Knowing that they would be promptly attended to, then honored and well looked after once back home, helped boost morale in the ''Grande Arm\u00e9e'', and thus further contributed to its fighting abilities. The most revolutionary aspect of the system was Larrey's attention to the wounded on both sides of the battlefield, a practice now enshrined in various [[Geneva Conventions]]. Napoleon held the French medical services, and Larrey, in high regard. As stated in the ''M\u00e9morial de Sainte-H\u00e9l\u00e8ne'', ''\"The Emperor had only the highest praise for Dr Larrey, declaring that he left him with the image of a truly good man who combined all the virtues of effective philanthropy and science to the highest degree. Every wounded soldier was a member of his family. Larrey is the most virtuous man I have ever met.\"''\n\nDespite these innovations, conditions in the ''Grande Arm\u00e9e'', as in all armies of the time, were primitive at best. Far more soldiers died of their wounds or from sickness than in battle (see [[Napoleonic Wars casualties]]). There was little knowledge of [[hygiene]] and nothing of [[antibiotic]]s. The main surgical procedure was [[amputation]]. The only crude form of [[anaesthetic]] readily available was a strong [[alcohol (drug)|alcohol]]ic drink, or even, in some cases, knocking the patient unconscious. Opiates such as [[laudanum]] were occasionally available for pain control. Typically, only about two-thirds survived such an operation, but this number increased with swift attention.\n\nAccounts of the ordeals of the wounded are horrific reading. Napoleon himself once noted, ''\"It requires more courage to suffer than to die\"'', so he made sure those who did survive were given the best treatment available at hospitals in France, in particular [[Les Invalides]], while they recuperated. The wounded survivours were often treated as heroes, awarded medals, pensions, and provided with [[prosthetic limb]]s if needed.\n\n=== Communications ===\nMost [[dispatch (logistics)|dispatches]] were conveyed as they had been for centuries, via messengers on horseback. Hussars, due to their bravery and riding skills, were often favoured for this task. Shorter range tactical signals could be sent visually by flags or audibly by drums, bugles, trumpets, and other musical instruments. Thus, standard bearers and musicians, in addition to their symbolic, ceremonial, and morale functions, also played important communication roles.\n[[File:Tour du telegraphe Chappe Saverne 02.JPG|thumb|right|A Chappe [[Optical telegraph|semaphore]] tower near [[Saverne]], France]]\nThe ''Grande Arm\u00e9e'' did benefit from innovations made in long-range communications during the French Revolution. The French Army was among the first to employ [[War pigeon|homing pigeons]] as messengers in any large and organised manner, and also the first to use [[Hot air balloon|observation balloons]] for reconnaissance and communications.{{citation needed|date=March 2014}} But the real advance for conveying long-range dispatches came in the form of an ingenious optical telegraph Semaphore system]invented by [[Claude Chappe]].{{citation needed|date=March 2014}}\n\nChappe's system consisted of an intricate network of small towers, within visual range of one another. On top of each was a 9-metre mast, with three large, movable wooden rods mounted on them.{{citation needed|date=March 2014}} These rods, called the ''r\u00e9gulateur'' (regulator), were operated by trained crews using a series of pulleys and levers. The four basic positions of the rods could be combined to form 196 different \"signs\".{{citation needed|date=March 2014}} Provided with good crews of operators and decent visibility conditions, a sign could be sent through the 15 station towers between Paris and [[Lille]], a distance of {{convert|193|km|mi|abbr=on}}, in only 9 minutes, a complete message of 36 signs in about 32 minutes. From Paris to [[Venice]], a message could be sent in only six hours.{{citation needed|date=March 2014}}\n\nChappe's telegraph soon became one of Napoleon's favourite and most important secret weapons. A special portable version semaphore telegraph travelled with his headquarters.{{citation needed|date=March 2014}} Using it, he was able to coordinate his logistics and forces over longer distances in far less time than his enemies. Work was even begun on a wagon-mounted version in 1812, but was not completed in time for use in the wars.{{citation needed|date=March 2014}}\n\n== Formations and tactics ==\n[[File:Grenadier Pied 1 1812 Revers.png|thumb|Banner of the 1st Regiment of ''Grenadier a Pied'', showing the regiment's battle honours]]\n\nWhile Napoleon is best known as a master strategist and charismatic presence on the battlefield, he was also a tactical innovator. He combined classic formations and tactics that had been used for thousands of years with more recent ones, such as [[Frederick the Great]]'s \"Oblique Order\" (best illustrated at the [[Battle of Leuthen]]) and the \"mob tactics\" of the early ''[[Lev\u00e9e en masse]]'' armies of the [[Lev\u00e9e en masse#The French Revolutionary Wars|Revolution]]. Napoleonic tactics and formations were highly fluid and flexible. In contrast, many of the ''Grande Arm\u00e9e''<nowiki/>'s opponents were still wedded to a rigid system of \"Linear\" (or Line) tactics and formations, in which masses of infantry would simply line up and exchange vollies of fire, in an attempt to either blow the enemy from the field or outflank them. Due to the vulnerabilities of the line formations to flanking attacks, it was considered the highest form of military manoeuvre to outflank one's adversary. Armies would often retreat or even surrender if this was accomplished. Consequently, commanders who adhered to this system would place a great emphasis on flank security, often at the expense of a strong centre or reserve. Napoleon would frequently take full advantage of this linear mentality by feigning flank attacks or offering the enemy his own flank as \"bait\" (best illustrated at the Battle of Austerlitz and also later a L\u00fctzen), then throw his main effort against their centre, split their lines, and roll up their flanks. He always kept a strong reserve as well, mainly in the form of his Imperial Guard, which could deliver a \"knockout blow\" if the battle was going well or turn the tide if it was not.\n\nSome of the more famous, widely used, effective, and interesting formations and tactics included:\n* '''[[Line (formation)|Line]]''' (''Ligne''): The basic three rank line formation, best used for delivering volley fire and was also a decent melee formation for infantry or cavalry, but it was relatively slow moving and vulnerable on the flanks.\n* '''[[Column (formation)|March Column]]''' (''Colonne de Marche''): The best formation for rapid or sustained movement of troops and a good melee attacking formation, but it offered little firepower and was also vulnerable to flank attack, ambush, artillery, and \"funneling\".\n* '''[[Flying wedge|Wedge]]''' (''Colonne de Charge''): An arrow or spearhead shaped cavalry formation, designed to close rapidly and break the enemy's line. Classic and effective mounted formation used throughout history, and still used by tanks today. But if the wedge was halted, or its attack lost momentum, then it was vulnerable to counter-[[pincer movement]]s on its flanks.\n* '''Attack Column''' (''Colonne d'Attaque''): A wide column of infantry, almost a hybrid of line and column, with light infantry skirmishers in front to disrupt the enemy and screen the column's advance. Once the column closed, the skirmishers would move off to its flanks, then the column would fire a massed musket salvo and charge with their bayonets. An excellent formation against a standard, thin line. The Attack Column was developed from the \"Mob\" or \"Horde\" tactics of the early French Revolutionary Armies. Its disadvantages were a lack of massed firepower and vulnerability to artillery fire.\n* '''[[Mixed Order]]''' (''Ordre Mixte''): Was Napoleon's preferred infantry formation. Some units (usually regiments or battalions in size) would be placed in line formation, with other units in attack column behind and in between them. This combined the firepower of the line with the speed, melee, and skirmishing advantages of the attack column. It also had some of the disadvantages of both, so support from artillery and cavalry were especially vital for this tactic to succeed.\n* '''[[Skirmisher|Open Order]]''' (''Ordre Ouvert''): Foot and/or horse would spread out by unit and/or individually. This formation was best for light troops and skirmishers. It allowed for rapid movement, especially over broken or rough terrain such as hills or forests, and offered the best protection from enemy fire since the troops were spread out. Its disadvantages were it did not allow for massed or volley fire and was terrible for melee or close quarters fighting and thus, especially vulnerable to cavalry.\n* '''[[Infantry square|Square]]''' (''Carr\u00e9''): Classic infantry formation for defence against cavalry. Soldiers would form a hollow square at least three or four ranks deep on each side, with officers and artillery or cavalry in the middle. It offered infantry their best protection against charges, especially on good defensive terrain such as on the top or reverse slope of a hill. Squares were slow moving, almost stationary targets, however. This, along with their density, made squares very vulnerable to artillery and to a lesser extent, infantry fire. Once broken, squares tended to completely collapse.\n* '''Flying Battery''' (''Batterie Volante''): Designed to take advantage of the French artillery's mobility and training. A battery would move to one area on the field, lay down a short, sharp barrage, then rapidly redeploy to another area and fire another barrage, then quickly redeploy again, etc. The combined, cumulative effect of numerous batteries doing this all along the enemy's lines could be devastating. The horse artillery were especially well suited for this tactic. Napoleon used it to great success in the early campaigns of the ''Grande Arm\u00e9e''. Its flexibility allowed him to quickly mass well-aimed fire anywhere it was needed. But it required superbly trained and conditioned artillerymen and horses as well as close command, coordination, and control in order to work.\n* '''[[Grand Battery]]''' (''Grande Batterie''): An alternative artillery tactic, when circumstances prohibited the flying batteries. Artillery would mass its fire at a single, crucial point on the battlefield (usually against the enemy's centre). It could be devastating if the enemy was caught by surprise or in the open. But massing large numbers of guns in a single area without the enemy's knowledge could be tricky. Once the battery opened fire and its target became clear, measures could be taken to avoid it. It was also vulnerable to [[counter-battery fire]] from enemy artillery and needed protection from cavalry attack. Although this has become the most well known French artillery tactic, Napoleon preferred the flying batteries and used it only when he had to or thought it posed a better chance of success. Often at the start of a battle, he would mass batteries into a large battery, then after a few salvoes, break it up into flying batteries. In the early campaigns it was rarely used, but as the quantity of the horses of the ''Grande Arm\u00e9e'' and the quality of its artillerymen declined, Napoleon would be forced to employ it much more frequently in later battles.\n* '''Boar's Head''' (''T\u00eate du Sanglier''): Another hybrid formation, somewhat like the mixed order, but combining all three arms into a wedge-like square, which could be used for assault or defence. Infantry would form a short, but thick, line many ranks deep on the front, which would be the boar's \"snout\" (''boutoir''). Behind them would be two groups of artillery batteries or the \"eyes\" of the boar. On their flanks and behind them, in oblique order, would be other infantry in column, line, or square to form the boar's \"face\". Protecting their flanks and rear would be two groups of cavalry, which would serve as the boar's \"tusk\". This was a highly complex formation, which could not be formed as easily or quickly as the others. Once formed, except for the tusks, it had slow mobility. It was, however, faster moving than the traditional square and less vulnerable to artillery or infantry fire. The \"tusks\" also gave it stronger offensive capabilities. It would later be employed to great effect during the French conquests in North Africa during the 1830s and 1840s, and would be used up until the 1920s.\n\n== Ranks of the ''Grande Arm\u00e9e''==\n{{Main|Ranks of the Grande Arm\u00e9e}}\nUnlike the armies of the ''[[Ancien R\u00e9gime]]'' and other monarchies, advancement in the ''Grande Arm\u00e9e'' was based on proven ability rather than social class or wealth. Napoleon wanted his army to be a [[meritocracy]], where every soldier, no matter how humble of birth, could rise rapidly to the highest levels of command, much as he had done (provided, of course, they did not rise too high or too fast).{{Citation needed|date=September 2014}} This was equally applied to the French and foreign officers, and no less than 140 foreigners attained the rank of ''G\u00e9n\u00e9ral''.<ref> Dempsey, p. 19.</ref> By and large this goal was achieved. Given the right opportunities to prove themselves, capable men could rise to the top within a few years, whereas in other armies it usually required decades if at all. It was said that even the lowliest private carried a marshal's baton in his knapsack.\n\n''Mar\u00e9chal d'Empire'', or [[Marshal of the Empire]], was not a rank within the ''Grande Arm\u00e9e'', but a personal title granted to distinguished divisional generals, along with higher pay and privileges. The same applied to the corps commanders (''General de Corps d'armee'') and army commanders (''General en chef'').
