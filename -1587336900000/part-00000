Richards and a partner contracted with Frank Lloyd Wright to design a hotel in [[Lake Geneva, Wisconsin]]. After this, Richards learned of Wright's new American System-Built Homes, and in 1914 began construction on six as demonstrator models. Richards gained the exclusive rights to manufacture and distribute the homes. He sold [[franchising|franchises]] to market the homes, and allowed only approved [[General contractor|contractors]] to build them. He had offices in [[Milwaukee]], the [[Chicago]] area, [[Champaign, Illinois|Champaign]], [[Decatur, Illinois|Decatur]] and [[Gary, Indiana|Gary]]. The Richards Company milled the lumber, cut it to specification, and packaged all the materials needed for construction, including plaster, paint, windows, hardware and fixtures. The customer purchased a complete home, so in addition to the materials, skilled craftsmen were provided.<ref name=\"wim\" />\n \nIn April 1917, the United States entered [[World War I]], and building materials were diverted to the war effort, stalling new home building. Later that year, Wright, dissatisfied with Richards, sued him for nonpayment of royalties and fees, and the project came to an end. It is believed that about 25 System-Built Homes were constructed, but only about 15 survive.

Richards and a partner contracted with Frank Lloyd Wright to design a hotel in [[Lake Geneva, Wisconsin]]. After this, Richards learned of Wright's new American System-Built Homes, and in 1914 began construction on six as demonstrator models. Richards gained the exclusive rights to manufacture and distribute the homes. He sold [[franchising|franchises]] to market the homes, and allowed only approved [[General contractor|contractors]] to build them. He had offices in [[Milwaukee]], the [[Chicago]] area, [[Champaign, Illinois|Champaign]], [[Decatur, Illinois|Decatur]] and [[Gary, Indiana|Gary]]. The Richards Company milled the lumber, cut it to specification, and packaged all the materials needed for construction, including plaster, paint, windows, hardware and fixtures. The customer purchased a complete home, so in addition to the materials, skilled craftsmen were provided.<ref name=\"wim\" />\n \nIn April 1917, the United States entered [[World War I]], and building materials were diverted to the war effort, stalling new home building. Later that year, Wright, dissatisfied with Richards, sued him for nonpayment of royalties and fees, and the project came to an end. It is believed that about 25 System-Built Homes were constructed, but only about 15 survive. They can be found in Wisconsin, Illinois, Indiana, and Iowa.<ref name=\"wim\" />\n\n== Burnham Street Historic District, Milwaukee ==\n\n[[Image:Wright System3 Milw Apr09.jpg|thumb|350px|Three of the six American System-Built Homes in the Burnham Street Historic District, [[Milwaukee, Wisconsin|Milwaukee]], Wisconsin]]\n\nThe original six homes built in the Burnham Park neighborhood of Milwaukee by Arthur Richards were added to the [[National Register of Historic Places]] in 1985.<ref>{{cite web|title=American System Built Homes-Burnham Street District|url=https://www.wisconsinhistory.org/Records/NationalRegister/NR1887|publisher=Wisconsin Historical Society|accessdate=2019-05-22}}</ref> There are four model 7a [[Duplex (building)|duplex]]es, a model B1 [[bungalow]],<ref name=\"wiw\">{{Cite web\n  | title = The Homes\n  | work = Wright in Milwaukee\n  | publisher = Frank Lloyd Wright Wisconsin Tourism Heritage Program\n  | year = 2010\n  | url = http://wrightinmilwaukee.org/Default.aspx\n  | accessdate = 11 June 2010 }}</ref> the only example of its kind, and a model C3 bungalow.
