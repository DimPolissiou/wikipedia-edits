Its foundation was due to the initiative of [[James Forbes (minister)|James Forbes]], of the Free Presbyterian Church, who arrived in 1838 as the first settled Christian minister in what became the colony of Victoria in 1851. It is \"the outcome of the old Scottish ideal of education\", in which church and school were inextricably connected. The school opened on 6 October 1851, under the name of the Melbourne Academy in a small house in Spring Street, with Robert Lawson, a Scot from [[Edinburgh University]], as the first principal. The house was soon outgrown, as was a larger one on the northwest corner of Spring and Little Collins Streets (later the Ulster Family Hotel) and the Church applied to the government for a grant of land. Two acres were reserved for the school on Eastern Hill and substantial new buildings were erected there in 1853. The cost was met partly by a government grant and partly from funds raised by the friends of the school.\n\nLawson resigned in 1856. Under his successor, [[Alexander Morrison (headmaster)|Alexander Morrison]], the school grew and prospered; it came under the oversight of the newly formed [[Presbyterian Church of Victoria]] in 1859. Morrison had been Rector of [[Hamilton Academy]] and remained at Scotch for 46 years, during almost all of which time his brother Robert was a master of the college.<ref>{{cite book|last=Pearl|first=Cyril|title=Morrison of Peking|publisher=Angus & Robertson|place=Sydney,Australia|date=1967}}</ref>{{rp|2}} [[William Still Littlejohn]], who took over the school in 1904, served for 29 years, and his successor, [[Colin Gilray|Colin Macdonald Gilray]], for 19. So, when the school became the first in Victoria to celebrate its centenary, Gilray was only the fourth principal.\n\nGilray was succeeded in 1953 by R. Selby Smith, an Old Rugbeian who had served in the [[Royal Navy]] during the war and was at the time of his appointment Deputy Director of Education for [[Warwickshire]]. Smith resigned in 1964 to become the Foundation Dean of Education at [[Monash University]].\n\nC. O. Healey, who had been Headmaster of [[Sydney Grammar School]] since 1951, succeeded Smith. Healey retired in January 1975.\n\nIn the following May, P. A. V. Roff, formerly Headmaster of [[Scotch College, Adelaide]], was installed as the seventh principal of the college. Roff's tenure, though a brief seven years, was characterised by an expanding voice for staff in the day-to-day management of the school, the establishment of a Foundation Office at the School under the direction of a Development Officer and the widening of the House System to provide greater depth in pastoral care. His last few years saw the school in dispute over ownership and, for the principal and his school community, it was a time of stress. In 1980 the decision was made to incorporate the school and a new Council was appointed, with representatives from the Presbyterian Church, the Old Scotch Collegians' Association and the community at large.\n\nF. G. Donaldson, a vice principal from [[Wallace High School (Northern Ireland)]], with a [[Doctor of Philosophy|Ph.D.]] in [[atomic physics]] from [[Queens University Belfast]], succeeded Roff in 1983. Under his principalship there was a significant building program that created new facilities for the education of boys, the development of ICT for administrative and educational purposes, and enhanced pastoral care of students.\n\nI. Tom Batty was appointed as the ninth principal of Scotch and installed into office on 14 July 2008. Prior to his appointment he was Housemaster of Villiers House, [[Eton College]] in the UK. The early years of Batty's tenure have seen the introduction of a new House-based pastoral care structure in the Upper School, which began at the start of the 2011 school year.\n\n==Name==\n[[File:scotch college callantina gatehouse.JPG|thumb|right|The name \"''Scotch College''\" appears at the entrance to the boarding precinct (2009)]]\nThe School was originally called \"''The Melbourne Academy''\", after its location, when it opened in 1851.

The Presbyterian Church of Australia continued with the remaining congregations.  In the split, Scotch College, Melbourne was allocated to the [[Presbyterian Church of Australia]] by the Handley Commission which was appointed to distribute the assets of the churches, which included an even number of representatives from the Uniting Church and the continuing Presbyterian Church as well as independent commissioners.

Its foundation was due to the initiative of [[James Forbes (minister)|James Forbes]], of the Free Presbyterian Church, who arrived in 1838 as the first settled Christian minister in what became the colony of Victoria in 1851. It is \"the outcome of the old Scottish ideal of education\", in which church and school were inextricably connected. The school opened on 6 October 1851, under the name of the Melbourne Academy in a small house in Spring Street, with Robert Lawson, a Scot from [[Edinburgh University]], as the first principal. The house was soon outgrown, as was a larger one on the northwest corner of Spring and Little Collins Streets (later the Ulster Family Hotel) and the Church applied to the government for a grant of land. Two acres were reserved for the school on Eastern Hill and substantial new buildings were erected there in 1853. The cost was met partly by a government grant and partly from funds raised by the friends of the school.\n\nLawson resigned in 1856. Under his successor, [[Alexander Morrison (headmaster)|Alexander Morrison]], the school grew and prospered; it came under the oversight of the newly formed [[Presbyterian Church of Victoria]] in 1859. Morrison had been Rector of [[Hamilton Academy]] and remained at Scotch for 46 years, during almost all of which time his brother Robert was a master of the college.<ref>{{cite book|last=Pearl|first=Cyril|title=Morrison of Peking|publisher=Angus & Robertson|place=Sydney,Australia|date=1967}}</ref>{{rp|2}} [[William Still Littlejohn]], who took over the school in 1904, served for 29 years, and his successor, [[Colin Gilray|Colin Macdonald Gilray]], for 19. So, when the school became the first in Victoria to celebrate its centenary, Gilray was only the fourth principal.\n\nGilray was succeeded in 1953 by R. Selby Smith, an Old Rugbeian who had served in the [[Royal Navy]] during the war and was at the time of his appointment Deputy Director of Education for [[Warwickshire]]. Smith resigned in 1964 to become the Foundation Dean of Education at [[Monash University]].\n\nC. O. Healey, who had been Headmaster of [[Sydney Grammar School]] since 1951, succeeded Smith. Healey retired in January 1975.\n\nIn the following May, P. A. V. Roff, formerly Headmaster of [[Scotch College, Adelaide]], was installed as the seventh principal of the college. Roff's tenure, though a brief seven years, was characterised by an expanding voice for staff in the day-to-day management of the school, the establishment of a Foundation Office at the School under the direction of a Development Officer and the widening of the House System to provide greater depth in pastoral care. His last few years saw the school in dispute over ownership and, for the principal and his school community, it was a time of stress. In 1980 the decision was made to incorporate the school and a new Council was appointed, with representatives from the Presbyterian Church, the Old Scotch Collegians' Association and the community at large.\n\nF. G. Donaldson, a vice principal from [[Wallace High School (Northern Ireland)]], with a [[Doctor of Philosophy|Ph.D.]] in [[atomic physics]] from [[Queens University Belfast]], succeeded Roff in 1983. Under his principalship there was a significant building program that created new facilities for the education of boys, the development of ICT for administrative and educational purposes, and enhanced pastoral care of students.\n\nI.

{"title_page": "Planck units", "text_new": "{{original research|date=June 2019}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=May 2019}}\nIn [[particle physics]] and [[physical cosmology]], '''Planck units''' are a set of [[units of measurement]] defined exclusively in terms of five universal [[physical constants]], in such a manner that these five physical constants take on the numerical value of [[1 (number)|1]] when expressed in terms of these units.\n\nOriginally proposed in 1899 by German physicist [[Max Planck]], these units are also known as [[natural units]] because the origin of their definition comes only from properties of [[Nature#Matter and energy|nature]] and not from any [[Prototype (metrology)|human construct]] (e.g. [[luminous intensity]] ([[candela|cd]]), [[luminous flux]] ([[Lumen (unit)|lm]]), and [[equivalent dose]] ([[Sievert|Sv]])) nor any quality of [[earth]] or [[universe]] (e.g. [[standard gravity]], [[atmosphere (unit)|standard atmosphere]], and [[Hubble constant]]) nor any quality of a given [[wikt:substance|substance]] (e.g. [[melting point]] of [[water]], [[density]] of [[water]], and [[specific heat capacity]] of [[water]]). Planck units are only one system of several systems of [[natural units]], but Planck units are not based on properties of any [[Prototype (metrology)|prototype object]] or [[elementary particle|particle]] (e.g. [[elementary charge]], [[electron rest mass]], and [[proton rest mass]]) (that would be arbitrarily chosen), but rather on only the properties of [[free space]] (e.g. [[Planck speed]] is [[speed of light]], [[Planck angular momentum]] is [[reduced Planck constant]], [[Planck resistance]] is [[impedance of free space]], [[Planck entropy]] is [[Boltzmann constant]], all are properties of free space). Planck units have significance for theoretical physics since they simplify several recurring [[algebraic expression]]s of [[physical law]] by [[nondimensionalization]]. They are relevant in research on unified theories such as [[quantum gravity]].\n\nThe term [[Planck scale]] refers to the magnitudes of space, time, energy and other units, below which (or beyond which) the predictions of the [[Standard Model]], [[quantum field theory]] and [[general relativity]] are no longer reconcilable, and  [[Quantum Gravity|quantum effects of gravity]] are expected to dominate. This region may be characterized by [[energy|energies]] around {{val|5.52|e=8|u=J}} or {{val|1.96|e=9|u=J}} (the [[Planck energy]]), [[time]] intervals around {{val|1.91|e=-43|u=s}} or {{val|5.39|e=\u221244|u=s}} (the [[Planck time]]) and [[length]]s around {{val|5.73|e=-35|u=m}} or {{val|1.62|e=-35|u=m}} (the [[Planck length]]). At the Planck scale, current models are not expected to be a useful guide to the cosmos, and [[physicist]]s have no [[scientific model]] to suggest how the physical universe behaves. The best known example is represented by the conditions in the first 10<sup>\u221243</sup> seconds [[Chronology of the universe|of our universe]] after the [[Big Bang]], approximately 13.8 billion years ago.\n\nThere are two versions of Planck units, [[Lorentz\u2013Heaviside units|Lorentz\u2013Heaviside version]] (also called \"rationalized\") and [[Gaussian units|Gaussian version]] (also called \"non-rationalized\").\n\nThe five [[universal constant]]s that Planck units, by definition, [[Normalization of an algebraic variety|normalize]] to 1 are:\n* the [[speed of light]] in vacuum, ''c'', (also known as '''Planck speed''')\n* the [[gravitational constant]], ''G'',\n** ''G'' for the Gaussian version, 4{{pi}}''G'' for the Lorentz\u2013Heaviside version\n* the [[reduced Planck constant]], ''\u0127'', (also known as '''Planck action''')\n* the [[vacuum permittivity]], ''\u03b5''<sub>0</sub> (also known as '''Planck permittivity''')\n** ''\u03b5''<sub>0</sub> for the Lorentz\u2013Heaviside version, 4{{pi}}''\u03b5''<sub>0</sub> for the Gaussian version\n* the [[Boltzmann constant]], ''k''<sub>B</sub> (also known as '''Planck entropy''')\n\nEach of these constants can be associated with a fundamental physical theory or concept: ''c'' with [[special relativity]], ''G'' with [[general relativity]], ''\u0127'' with [[quantum mechanics]], ''\u03b5''<sub>0</sub> with [[electromagnetism]], and ''k''<sub>B</sub> with the notion of [[temperature]]/[[energy]] ([[statistical mechanics]] and [[thermodynamics]]).\n\n== Introduction ==\nAny system of measurement may be assigned a mutually independent set of base quantities and associated [[Base unit (measurement)|base units]], from which all other quantities and units may be derived.  In the [[International System of Units]], for example, the [[SI base quantity|SI base quantities]] include length with the associated unit of the [[metre]]. In the system of Planck units, a similar set of base quantities may be selected, and the Planck base unit of length is then known simply as the [[Planck length]], the base unit of time is the [[Planck time]], and so on. These units are derived from the five dimensional universal physical constants of Table 1, in such a manner that these constants are eliminated from fundamental selected equations of physical law when physical quantities are expressed in terms of Planck units. For example, Newton's [[law of universal gravitation]],\n\n: <math> \\begin{align}\n F &= G \\frac{m_1 m_2}{r^2} \\\\\n \\\\\n   &= \\left( \\frac{F_\\text{P} l_\\text{P}^2}{m_\\text{P}^2} \\right) \\frac{m_1 m_2}{r^2} \\\\\n \\end{align}</math>\n\ncan be expressed as:\n\n: <math> \\frac{F}{F_\\text{P}} = \\frac{\\left(\\dfrac{m_1}{m_\\text{P}}\\right) \\left(\\dfrac{m_2}{m_\\text{P}}\\right)}{\\left(\\dfrac{r}{l_\\text{P}}\\right)^2}.</math>\n\nBoth equations are [[dimensional analysis|dimensionally consistent]] and equally valid in ''any'' system of units, but the second equation, with ''G'' missing, is relating only [[dimensionless quantities]] since any ratio of two like-dimensioned quantities is a dimensionless quantity. If, by a shorthand convention, it is understood that all physical quantities are expressed in terms of Planck units, the ratios above may be expressed simply with the symbols of physical quantity, without being scaled explicitly by their corresponding unit:\n\n: <math> F = \\frac{m_1 m_2}{r^2} \\ .</math>\n\nThis last equation (without ''G'')  is valid only if ''F'', ''m''<sub>1</sub>, ''m''<sub>2</sub>, and ''r'' are the dimensionless numerical values of these quantities measured in terms of Planck units. This is why Planck units or any other use of natural units should be employed with care. Referring to {{nowrap|''G'' {{=}} ''c'' {{=}} 1}}, [[Paul S. Wesson]] wrote that, \"Mathematically it is an acceptable trick which saves labour.

Yet relative to other units of measurement such as [[International System of Units|SI]], the values of the Planck units, other than the Planck charge, are only known ''approximately.'' This is due to uncertainty in the value of the gravitational constant ''G'' as measured relative to SI unit definitions.\n\nToday the value of the speed of light ''c'' in SI units is not subject to measurement error, because the SI base unit of length, the [[metre]], is now ''defined'' as the length of the path travelled by light in vacuum during a time interval of {{sfrac|{{gaps|299|792|458}}}} of a second. Hence the value of ''c'' is now exact by definition, and contributes no uncertainty to the SI equivalents of the Planck units. The same is true of the value of the vacuum permittivity ''\u03b5''<sub>0</sub>, due to the definition of [[ampere]] which sets the [[vacuum permeability]] ''\u03bc''<sub>0</sub> to {{nowrap|4{{pi}} \u00d7 10<sup>\u22127</sup> H/m}} and the fact that ''\u03bc''<sub>0</sub>''\u03b5''<sub>0</sub> = {{sfrac|''c''<sup>2</sup>}}. The numerical value of the reduced Planck constant ''\u0127'' has been determined experimentally to 12 parts per billion, while that of ''G'' has been determined experimentally to no better than 1 part in {{val|21300}} (or {{val|47000}} parts per billion).<ref name=\"CODATA\" /> ''G'' appears in the definition of almost every Planck unit in Tables 2 and 3, but not all. Hence the uncertainty in the values of the Table 2 and 3 SI equivalents of the Planck units derives almost entirely from uncertainty in the value of ''G''. (The propagation of the error in ''G'' is a function of the exponent of ''G'' in the algebraic expression for a unit. Since that exponent is \u00b1{{sfrac|1|2}} for every base unit other than Planck charge, the relative uncertainty of each base unit is about one half that of ''G''. This is indeed the case; according to CODATA, the experimental values of the SI equivalents of the base Planck units are known to about 1 part in {{val|43500}}, or {{val|23000}} parts per billion.)\n\n== Derived units ==\n{{unreferenced section|date=February 2020}}\nIn any system of measurement, units for many physical quantities can be derived from base units. Table 3 offers a sample of [[derived units|derived]] Planck units, some of which in fact are seldom used. As with the base units, their use is mostly confined to theoretical physics because most of them are too large or too small for empirical or practical use and there are large uncertainties in their values.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"margin:1em auto 1em auto; background:#fff;\"\n|+ Table 3: Derived Planck units\n|-\n! rowspan=2| Name\n! rowspan=2| [[Dimension (physics)|Dimension]]\n! colspan=2| Expression\n! colspan=2| Approximate [[SI]] equivalent\n|-\n!

From the point of view of Planck units, this is [[comparing apples to oranges]], because [[mass]] and [[electric charge]] are [[Dimensional analysis|incommensurable]] quantities. Rather, the disparity of magnitude of force is a manifestation of the fact that the [[elementary charge|charge on the protons]] is approximately the [[Planck charge|unit charge]] but the [[Proton mass|mass of the protons]] is far less than the [[Planck mass|unit mass]].\n\n=== Cosmology ===\n{{Main|Chronology of the Universe}}\n{{anchor|Planck epoch}}\nIn [[Big Bang cosmology]], the '''Planck epoch''' or '''Planck era''' is the earliest stage of the [[Big Bang]], before the [[cosmic time|time passed]] was equal to the [[Planck time]], ''t''<sub>P</sub>, or approximately 10<sup>\u221243</sup> seconds.<ref name=\"Planck-UOregon\">{{cite web |author=Staff |title=Birth of the Universe |url=http://abyss.uoregon.edu/~js/cosmo/lectures/lec20.html |date= |work=[[University of Oregon]] |accessdate=September 24, 2016 }} - discusses \"[[Planck time]]\" and \"[[Planck era]]\" at the very beginning of the [[Universe]]</ref> There is no currently available physical theory to describe such short times, and it is not clear in what sense the concept of [[time]] is meaningful for values smaller than the Planck time.

At this scale, the [[grand unification|unified force]] of the [[Standard Model]] is assumed to be [[Theory of everything|unified with gravitation]]. Immeasurably [[Planck temperature|hot]] and [[Planck density|dense]], the state of the Planck epoch was succeeded by the [[grand unification epoch]], where gravitation is separated from the unified force of the Standard Model, in turn followed by the [[inflationary epoch]], which ended after about 10<sup>\u221232</sup> seconds (or about 10<sup>10</sup>&nbsp;''t''<sub>P</sub>).<ref name=\"KolbTurner1994\">{{cite book|author1=Edward W.

A., 1999, \"[http://old.ihst.ru/personal/tomilin/papers/tomil.pdf Natural Systems of Units: To the Centenary Anniversary of the Planck System]\", 287\u2013296.</ref> At the end of the paper, Planck introduced, as a consequence of his discovery, the base units later named in his honor. The Planck units are based on the quantum of action, now usually known as [[Planck's constant]]. Planck called the constant ''b'' in his paper, though ''h'' (or ''\u0127'') is now common. However, at that time it was entering Wien's radiation law which Planck thought to be correct. Planck underlined the universality of the new unit system, writing:\n{{bq|''...ihre Bedeutung f\u00fcr alle Zeiten und f\u00fcr alle, auch au\u00dferirdische und au\u00dfermenschliche Kulturen notwendig behalten und welche daher als \u00bbnat\u00fcrliche Ma\u00dfeinheiten\u00ab bezeichnet werden k\u00f6nnen...''\n...These necessarily retain their meaning for all times and for all civilizations, even extraterrestrial and non-human ones, and can therefore be designated as \"natural units\"...}}\nPlanck considered only the units based on the universal constants ''G'', ''\u0127'', ''c'', and ''k''<sub>B</sub> to arrive at natural units for [[length]], [[time]], [[mass]], and [[temperature]].<ref name=\"TOM\" /> Planck did not adopt any electromagnetic units. However, since the [[Gaussian units#\"Rationalized\" unit systems|non-rationalized]] gravitational constant, ''G'', is set to 1, a natural extension of Planck units to a unit of [[electric charge]] is to also set the non-rationalized Coulomb constant, ''k''<sub>e</sub>, to 1 as well (as well as the Stoney units).<ref name=\"PAV\">{{cite book|last=Pav\u0161ic|first=Matej|title=The Landscape of Theoretical Physics: A Global View|volume=119|year=2001|publisher=Kluwer Academic|location=Dordrecht|isbn=978-0-7923-7006-2|pages=347\u2013352|url=https://www.springer.com/gp/book/9781402003516#otherversion=9780792370062|series=Fundamental Theories of Physics | doi = 10.1007/0-306-47136-1 |arxiv=gr-qc/0610061}}</ref> This is the non-rationalized Planck units (Planck units with the Gaussian version), which is more convenient but not rationalized, there is also a Planck system which is rationalized (Planck units with the Lorentz\u2013Heaviside version), set 4{{pi}}''G'' and ''\u03b5''<sub>0</sub> (instead of ''G'' and ''k''<sub>e</sub>) to 1, which may be less convenient but is rationalized.

These normalizations are neither the only ones possible nor necessarily the best. Moreover, the choice of what factors to normalize, among the factors appearing in the fundamental equations of physics, is not evident, and the values of the Planck units are sensitive to this choice.\n\nThe factor 4{{pi}} is ubiquitous in [[theoretical physics]] because the surface area of a [[sphere]] of radius ''r'' is 4{{pi}}''r''<sup>2</sup>. This, along with the concept of [[flux]], are the basis for the [[inverse-square law]], [[Gauss's law]], and the [[divergence]] operator applied to [[flux density]]. For example, [[Gravitational field|gravitational]] and [[electrostatic field]]s produced by point charges have spherical symmetry (Barrow 2002: 214\u201315). The 4{{pi}}''r''<sup>2</sup> appearing in the denominator of Coulomb's law in [[Lorentz\u2013Heaviside units#Maxwell's equations with sources|rationalized form]], for example, follows from the flux of an electrostatic field being distributed uniformly on the surface of a sphere. Likewise for Newton's law of universal gravitation. (If space had more than three spatial dimensions, the factor 4{{pi}} would have to be changed according to the geometry of the [[S\u00b2|sphere in higher dimensions]].)\n\nHence a substantial body of physical theory developed since Planck (1899) suggests normalizing not ''G'' but either 4{{pi}}''G'' (or 8{{pi}}''G'' or 16{{pi}}''G'') to 1. Doing so would introduce a factor of {{sfrac|4{{pi}}}} (or {{sfrac|8{{pi}}}} or {{sfrac|16{{pi}}}}) into the nondimensionalized form of the law of universal gravitation, consistent with the modern rationalized formulation of Coulomb's law in terms of the vacuum permittivity. In fact, alternative normalizations frequently preserve the factor of {{sfrac|4{{pi}}}} in the nondimensionalized form of Coulomb's law as well, so that the nondimensionalized Maxwell's equations for electromagnetism and [[gravitoelectromagnetism]] both take the same form as those for electromagnetism in SI, which do not have any factors of 4{{pi}}.  When this is applied to electromagnetic constants, \u03b5<sub>0</sub>, this unit system is called ''\"rationalized\"'' [[Lorentz\u2013Heaviside units]].  When applied additionally to gravitation and Planck units, these are called '''rationalized Planck units'''<ref>{{cite journal|title=Kaluza-Klein Monopole|journal=Physical Review Letters|volume=51|issue=2|pages=87\u201390|year=1983|last=Sorkin|first=Rafael|doi=10.1103/PhysRevLett.51.87|bibcode=1983PhRvL..51...87S}}</ref> and are seen in [https://books.google.com/books?id=1wUFoP7HC38C&pg=PA271&lpg=PA271&dq=elementary+charge+0.3028 high-energy physics].\n\nThe rationalized Planck units are defined so that <math>c=4\\pi G=\\hbar=\\epsilon_0=k_\\text{B}=1</math>. These are the Planck units based on [[Lorentz\u2013Heaviside units]] (instead of on the more conventional [[Gaussian units]]) as depicted above.\n\nThere are several possible alternative normalizations.\n\n=== Gravity ===\n<!-- [[Reduced Planck units]], [[Planck mass]] and [[Cosmological constant]] link to this section -->\nIn 1899, Newton's law of universal gravitation was still seen as exact, rather than as a convenient approximation holding for \"small\" velocities and masses (the approximate nature of Newton's law was shown following the development of [[general relativity]] in 1915). Hence Planck normalized to 1 the [[gravitational constant]] ''G'' in Newton's law. In theories emerging after 1899, ''G'' nearly always appears in formulae multiplied by 4{{pi}} or a small integer multiple thereof. Hence, a choice to be made when designing a system of natural units is which, if any, instances of 4{{pi}} appearing in the equations of physics are to be eliminated via the normalization.\n* Normalizing 4{{pi}}''G'' to 1: (such as the Lorentz\u2013Heaviside version Planck units)\n** [[Newton's law of universal gravitation]] has 4{{pi}}''r''<sup>2</sup> remaining in the denominator (which is the surface area of the enclosing sphere at radius ''r'').\n** [[Gauss's law for gravity]] becomes {{nowrap|1=''\u03a6''<sub>'''g'''</sub> = \u2212''M''}} (rather than {{nowrap|1=''\u03a6''<sub>'''g'''</sub> = \u22124{{pi}}''M''}} in Planck units).\n** Eliminates 4{{pi}}''G'' from the [[Poisson equation]].\n** Eliminates 4{{pi}}''G'' in the [[Gravitoelectromagnetism|gravitoelectromagnetic]] (GEM) equations, which hold in weak [[gravitational field]]s or [[Locally flat spacetime|locally flat space-time]]. These equations have the same form as Maxwell's equations (and the [[Lorentz force]] equation) of [[electromagnetism]], with [[mass density]] replacing [[charge density]], and with {{sfrac|4{{pi}}''G''}} replacing \u03b5<sub>0</sub>.\n** Normalizes the [[characteristic impedance]] ''Z''<sub>0</sub> of [[gravitational radiation]] in free space to 1.

This would eliminate 8{{pi}}''G'' from the [[Einstein field equations]], [[Einstein\u2013Hilbert action]], and the [[Friedmann equations]], for gravitation. Planck units modified so that {{nowrap|1=8{{pi}}''G'' = 1}} are known as ''reduced Planck units'', because the [[reduced Planck mass|Planck mass]] is divided by {{sqrt|8{{pi}}}}. Also, the Bekenstein\u2013Hawking formula for the entropy of a black hole simplifies to {{nowrap|1=''S''<sub>BH</sub> = (''m''<sub>BH</sub>)<sup>2</sup>/2 = 2{{pi}}''A''<sub>BH</sub>}}.\n* Setting {{nowrap|1=16{{pi}}''G'' = 1}}. This would eliminate the constant {{sfrac|''c''<sup>4</sup>|16{{pi}}''G''}} from the Einstein\u2013Hilbert action. The form of the Einstein field equations with [[cosmological constant]] ''\u039b'' becomes {{nowrap|1=''R<sub>\u03bc\u03bd</sub>'' + ''\u039bg<sub>\u03bc\u03bd</sub>'' = {{sfrac|2}}(''Rg<sub>\u03bc\u03bd</sub>'' + ''T<sub>\u03bc\u03bd</sub>'')}}.\n\n=== Electromagnetism ===\nPlanck units normalize to 1 the [[Coulomb force constant]] ''k''<sub>e</sub> = {{sfrac|4{{pi}}''\u03b5''<sub>0</sub>}} (as does the [[cgs]] system of units).

Such cosmologies have not gained mainstream acceptance and yet there is still considerable scientific interest in the possibility that physical \"constants\" might change, although such propositions introduce difficult questions. Perhaps the first question to address is: How would such a change make a noticeable operational difference in physical measurement or, more fundamentally, our perception of reality? If some particular physical constant had changed, how would we notice it, or how would physical reality be different? Which changed constants result in a meaningful and measurable difference in physical reality? If a [[physical constant]] that is not [[dimensionless]], such as the [[speed of light]], ''did'' in fact change, would we be able to notice it or measure it unambiguously? \u2013 a question examined by [[Michael Duff (physicist)|Michael Duff]] in his paper \"Comment on time-variation of fundamental constants\".<ref name=\"hep-th0208093\">{{cite journal|author=Michael Duff |title=How fundamental are fundamental constants?|arxiv=1412.2040|doi=10.1080/00107514.2014.980093|author-link=Michael Duff (physicist)|doi-broken-date=2020-03-21|url=https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/00107514.2014.980093|journal=Contemporary Physics|volume=56|issue=1|pages=35\u201347|year=2015}}</ref>\n\n[[George Gamow]] argued in his book ''[[Mr Tompkins in Wonderland]]'' that a sufficient change in a dimensionful physical constant, such as the speed of light in a vacuum, would result in obvious perceptible changes.

The pure number we call the fine structure constant and denote by ''\u03b1'' is a combination of the electron charge, ''e'', the speed of light, ''c'', and Planck's constant, ''h''. At first we might be tempted to think that a world in which the speed of light was slower would be a different world. But this would be a mistake. If ''c'', ''h'', and ''e'' were all changed so that the values they have in metric (or any other) units were different when we looked them up in our tables of physical constants, but the value of ''\u03b1'' remained the same, this new world would be ''observationally indistinguishable'' from our world.

It is no different for physical experiments, as all physical quantities are measured relative to some other like-dimensioned quantity.\n\nWe can notice a difference if some dimensionless physical quantity such as [[fine-structure constant]], ''\u03b1'', changes or the [[proton-to-electron mass ratio]], {{sfrac|''m''<sub>p</sub>|''m''<sub>e</sub>}}, changes (atomic structures would change) but if all dimensionless physical quantities remained unchanged (this includes all possible ratios of identically dimensioned physical quantity), we cannot tell if a dimensionful quantity, such as the [[speed of light]], ''c'', has changed. And, indeed, the Tompkins concept becomes meaningless in our perception of reality if a dimensional quantity such as ''c'' [[Variable speed of light|has changed]], even drastically.\n\nIf the speed of light ''c'', were somehow suddenly cut in half and changed to {{sfrac|2}}''c'' (but with the axiom that ''all'' dimensionless physical quantities remain the same), then the Planck length would ''increase'' by a factor of 2{{sqrt|2}} from the point of view of some unaffected observer on the outside. Measured by \"mortal\" observers in terms of Planck units, the new speed of light would remain as 1 new Planck length per 1 new Planck time \u2013 which is no different from the old measurement. But, since by axiom, the size of atoms (approximately the [[Bohr radius]]) are related to the Planck length by an unchanging dimensionless constant of proportionality:\n\n: <math>a_0 = \\frac{4 \\pi \\epsilon_0 \\hbar^2}{m_e e^2} = \\frac{m_\\text{P}}{m_e \\alpha} l_\\text{P}. </math>\n\nThen atoms would be bigger (in one dimension) by 2{{sqrt|2}}, each of us would be taller by 2{{sqrt|2}}, and so would our metre sticks be taller (and wider and thicker) by a factor of 2{{sqrt|2}}. Our perception of distance and lengths relative to the Planck length is, by axiom, an unchanging dimensionless constant.\n\nOur clocks would tick slower by a factor of 4{{sqrt|2}} (from the point of view of this unaffected observer on the outside) because the Planck time has increased by 4{{sqrt|2}} but we would not know the difference (our perception of durations of time relative to the Planck time is, by axiom, an unchanging dimensionless constant). This hypothetical unaffected observer on the outside might observe that light now propagates at half the speed that it previously did (as well as all other observed velocities) but it would still travel {{val|299792458}} of our ''new'' metres in the time elapsed by one of our ''new'' seconds ({{sfrac|2}}''c'' \u00d7 4{{sqrt|2}} \u00f7 2{{sqrt|2}} continues to equal {{val|299792458|u=m/s}}). We would not notice any difference.\n\nThis contradicts what [[George Gamow]] writes in his book ''[[Mr. Tompkins]]''; there, Gamow suggests that if a dimension-dependent universal constant such as ''c'' changed significantly, we ''would'' easily notice the difference. The disagreement is better thought of as the ambiguity in the phrase ''\"changing a physical constant\"''; what would happen depends on whether (1)&nbsp;all other ''dimensionless'' constants were kept the same, or whether (2)&nbsp;all other dimension-''dependent'' constants are kept the same. The second choice is a somewhat confusing possibility, since most of our units of measurement are defined in relation to the outcomes of physical experiments, and the experimental results depend on the constants. Gamow does not address this subtlety; the thought experiments he conducts in his popular works assume the second choice for ''\"changing a physical constant\"''. And Duff or Barrow would point out that ascribing a change in measurable reality, i.e. [[fine-structure constant|''\u03b1'']], to a specific dimensional component quantity, such as [[speed of light|''c'']], is unjustified. The very same operational difference in measurement or perceived reality could just as well be caused by a change in [[Planck constant|''h'']] or [[elementary charge|''e'']] if ''\u03b1'' is changed and no other dimensionless constants are changed.  It is only the dimensionless physical constants that ultimately matter in the definition of worlds.<ref name=\"hep-th0208093\" /><ref>[[John Baez]] [http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/constants.html How Many Fundamental Constants Are There?]</ref>\n\nThis unvarying aspect of the Planck-relative scale, or that of any other system of natural units, leads many theorists to conclude that a hypothetical change in dimensionful physical constants can only be manifest as a change in [[dimensionless physical constant]]s.

Planck units are only one system of several systems of [[natural units]], but Planck units are not based on properties of any [[Prototype (metrology)|prototype object]] or [[elementary particle|particle]] (e.g. [[elementary charge]], [[electron rest mass]], and [[proton rest mass]]) (that would be arbitrarily chosen), but rather on only the properties of [[free space]] (e.g. [[Planck speed]] is [[speed of light]], [[Planck angular momentum]] is [[reduced Planck constant]], [[Planck resistance]] is [[impedance of free space]], [[Planck entropy]] is [[Boltzmann constant]], all are properties of free space). Planck units have significance for theoretical physics since they simplify several recurring [[algebraic expression]]s of [[physical law]] by [[nondimensionalization]]. They are relevant in research on unified theories such as [[quantum gravity]].\n\nThe term [[Planck scale]] refers to the magnitudes of space, time, energy and other units, below which (or beyond which) the predictions of the [[Standard Model]], [[quantum field theory]] and [[general relativity]] are no longer reconcilable, and  [[Quantum Gravity|quantum effects of gravity]] are expected to dominate. This region may be characterized by [[energy|energies]] around {{val|5.52|e=8|u=J}} or {{val|1.96|e=9|u=J}} (the [[Planck energy]]), [[time]] intervals around {{val|1.91|e=-43|u=s}} or {{val|5.39|e=\u221244|u=s}} (the [[Planck time]]) and [[length]]s around {{val|5.73|e=-35|u=m}} or {{val|1.62|e=-35|u=m}} (the [[Planck length]]). At the Planck scale, current models are not expected to be a useful guide to the cosmos, and [[physicist]]s have no [[scientific model]] to suggest how the physical universe behaves. The best known example is represented by the conditions in the first 10<sup>\u221243</sup> seconds [[Chronology of the universe|of our universe]] after the [[Big Bang]], approximately 13.8 billion years ago.\n\nThere are two versions of Planck units, [[Lorentz\u2013Heaviside units|Lorentz\u2013Heaviside version]] (also called \"rationalized\") and [[Gaussian units|Gaussian version]] (also called \"non-rationalized\").\n\nThe five [[universal constant]]s that Planck units, by definition, [[Normalization of an algebraic variety|normalize]] to 1 are:\n* the [[speed of light]] in vacuum, ''c'', (also known as '''Planck speed''')\n* the [[gravitational constant]], ''G'',\n** ''G'' for the Gaussian version, 4{{pi}}''G'' for the Lorentz\u2013Heaviside version\n* the [[reduced Planck constant]], ''\u0127'', (also known as '''Planck action''')\n* the [[vacuum permittivity]], ''\u03b5''<sub>0</sub> (also known as '''Planck permittivity''')\n** ''\u03b5''<sub>0</sub> for the Lorentz\u2013Heaviside version, 4{{pi}}''\u03b5''<sub>0</sub> for the Gaussian version\n* the [[Boltzmann constant]], ''k''<sub>B</sub> (also known as '''Planck entropy''')\n\nEach of these constants can be associated with a fundamental physical theory or concept: ''c'' with [[special relativity]], ''G'' with [[general relativity]], ''\u0127'' with [[quantum mechanics]], ''\u03b5''<sub>0</sub> with [[electromagnetism]], and ''k''<sub>B</sub> with the notion of [[temperature]]/[[energy]] ([[statistical mechanics]] and [[thermodynamics]]).\n\n== Introduction ==\nAny system of measurement may be assigned a mutually independent set of base quantities and associated [[Base unit (measurement)|base units]], from which all other quantities and units may be derived.  In the [[International System of Units]], for example, the [[SI base quantity|SI base quantities]] include length with the associated unit of the [[metre]]. In the system of Planck units, a similar set of base quantities may be selected, and the Planck base unit of length is then known simply as the [[Planck length]], the base unit of time is the [[Planck time]], and so on. These units are derived from the five dimensional universal physical constants of Table 1, in such a manner that these constants are eliminated from fundamental selected equations of physical law when physical quantities are expressed in terms of Planck units. For example, Newton's [[law of universal gravitation]],\n\n: <math> \\begin{align}\n F &= G \\frac{m_1 m_2}{r^2} \\\\\n \\\\\n   &= \\left( \\frac{F_\\text{P} l_\\text{P}^2}{m_\\text{P}^2} \\right) \\frac{m_1 m_2}{r^2} \\\\\n \\end{align}</math>\n\ncan be expressed as:\n\n: <math> \\frac{F}{F_\\text{P}} = \\frac{\\left(\\dfrac{m_1}{m_\\text{P}}\\right) \\left(\\dfrac{m_2}{m_\\text{P}}\\right)}{\\left(\\dfrac{r}{l_\\text{P}}\\right)^2}.</math>\n\nBoth equations are [[dimensional analysis|dimensionally consistent]] and equally valid in ''any'' system of units, but the second equation, with ''G'' missing, is relating only [[dimensionless quantities]] since any ratio of two like-dimensioned quantities is a dimensionless quantity. If, by a shorthand convention, it is understood that all physical quantities are expressed in terms of Planck units, the ratios above may be expressed simply with the symbols of physical quantity, without being scaled explicitly by their corresponding unit:\n\n: <math> F = \\frac{m_1 m_2}{r^2} \\ .</math>\n\nThis last equation (without ''G'')  is valid only if ''F'', ''m''<sub>1</sub>, ''m''<sub>2</sub>, and ''r'' are the dimensionless numerical values of these quantities measured in terms of Planck units. This is why Planck units or any other use of natural units should be employed with care. Referring to {{nowrap|''G'' {{=}} ''c'' {{=}} 1}}, [[Paul S. Wesson]] wrote that, \"Mathematically it is an acceptable trick which saves labour.

Yet relative to other units of measurement such as [[International System of Units|SI]], the values of the Planck units, other than the Planck charge, are only known ''approximately.'' This is due to uncertainty in the value of the gravitational constant ''G'' as measured relative to SI unit definitions.\n\nToday the value of the speed of light ''c'' in SI units is not subject to measurement error, because the SI base unit of length, the [[metre]], is now ''defined'' as the length of the path travelled by light in vacuum during a time interval of {{sfrac|{{gaps|299|792|458}}}} of a second. Hence the value of ''c'' is now exact by definition, and contributes no uncertainty to the SI equivalents of the Planck units. The same is true of the value of the vacuum permittivity ''\u03b5''<sub>0</sub>, due to the definition of [[ampere]] which sets the [[vacuum permeability]] ''\u03bc''<sub>0</sub> to {{nowrap|4{{pi}} \u00d7 10<sup>\u22127</sup> H/m}} and the fact that ''\u03bc''<sub>0</sub>''\u03b5''<sub>0</sub> = {{sfrac|''c''<sup>2</sup>}}. The numerical value of the reduced Planck constant ''\u0127'' has been determined experimentally to 12 parts per billion, while that of ''G'' has been determined experimentally to no better than 1 part in {{val|21300}} (or {{val|47000}} parts per billion).<ref name=\"CODATA\" /> ''G'' appears in the definition of almost every Planck unit in Tables 2 and 3, but not all. Hence the uncertainty in the values of the Table 2 and 3 SI equivalents of the Planck units derives almost entirely from uncertainty in the value of ''G''. (The propagation of the error in ''G'' is a function of the exponent of ''G'' in the algebraic expression for a unit. Since that exponent is \u00b1{{sfrac|1|2}} for every base unit other than Planck charge, the relative uncertainty of each base unit is about one half that of ''G''. This is indeed the case; according to CODATA, the experimental values of the SI equivalents of the base Planck units are known to about 1 part in {{val|43500}}, or {{val|23000}} parts per billion.)\n\n== Derived units ==\n{{unreferenced section|date=February 2020}}\nIn any system of measurement, units for many physical quantities can be derived from base units. Table 3 offers a sample of [[derived units|derived]] Planck units, some of which in fact are seldom used. As with the base units, their use is mostly confined to theoretical physics because most of them are too large or too small for empirical or practical use and there are large uncertainties in their values.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"margin:1em auto 1em auto; background:#fff;\"\n|+ Table 3: Derived Planck units\n|-\n! rowspan=2| Name\n! rowspan=2| [[Dimension (physics)|Dimension]]\n! colspan=2| Expression\n! colspan=2| Approximate [[SI]] equivalent\n|-\n!

For example:\n* 1 [[Planck mass]] is about [[1 E\u22129 kg|6.14 \u03bcg]] (Lorentz\u2013Heaviside version) or [[1 E\u22128 kg|21.8 \u03bcg]] (Gaussian version);\n* 1 [[Planck momentum]] is about 1.84 [[Newton-second|N\u22c5s]] (Lorentz\u2013Heaviside version) or 6.52 [[Newton-second|N\u22c5s]] (Gaussian version);\n* 1 [[Planck energy]] is about [[1 E8 J|153 kW\u22c5h]] (Lorentz\u2013Heaviside version) or [[1 E9 J|543 kW\u22c5h]] (Gaussian version);\n* 1 [[Planck angle]] is 1 [[radian]] (both versions);\n* 1 [[Planck solid angle]] is 1 [[steradian]] (both versions);\n* 1 [[Planck charge]] is about 3.3 [[elementary charge]]s (Lorentz\u2013Heaviside version) or 11.7 [[elementary charge]]s (Gaussian version);\n* 1 [[Planck impedance]] is about 377 [[ohm]]s (Lorentz\u2013Heaviside version) or 30 [[ohm]]s (Gaussian version);\n* 1 [[Planck admittance]] is about 2.65 [[Siemens|mS]] (Lorentz\u2013Heaviside version) or 33.4 [[Siemens|mS]] (Gaussian version);\n* 1 [[Planck permeability]] is about 1.26 [[Henry per metre|\u03bcH/m]] (Lorentz\u2013Heaviside version) or 0.1 [[Henry per metre|\u03bcH/m]] (Gaussian version);\n* 1 [[Planck electric flux]] is about 59.8 [[Volt-metre|mV\u22c5\u03bcm]] (Lorentz\u2013Heaviside version) or 16.9 [[Volt-metre|mV\u22c5\u03bcm]] (Gaussian version).\n\nHowever, most Planck units are many [[orders of magnitude]] too large or too small to be of practical use, so that Planck units as a system are really only relevant to theoretical physics. In fact, 1 Planck unit is often the largest or smallest value of a physical quantity that makes sense according to our current understanding.

At that moment, [[Quantum mechanics|quantum theory]] as presently understood becomes applicable. Understanding the universe when it was less than 1 Planck time old requires a theory of [[quantum gravity]] that would incorporate quantum effects into [[general relativity]]. Such a theory does not yet exist.\n\nIn Planck units, we have:\n\n:<math>\\alpha=\\frac{e^2}{4\\pi}</math> (Lorentz\u2013Heaviside version)\n:<math>\\alpha=e^2</math> (Gaussian version)\n:<math>\\alpha_G=\\frac{m_e^2}{4\\pi}</math> (Lorentz\u2013Heaviside version)\n:<math>\\alpha_G=m_e^2</math> (Gaussian version)\n\nwhere\n\n:<math>\\alpha</math> is the [[fine-structure constant]]\n:<math>e</math> is the [[elementary charge]]\n:<math>\\alpha_G</math> is the [[gravitational coupling constant]]\n:<math>m_e</math> is the [[electron rest mass]]\n\nHence the [[specific charge]] of [[electron]] (<math>\\frac{e}{m_e}</math>) is <math>\\sqrt{\\frac{\\alpha}{\\alpha_G}}</math> [[Planck specific charge]], in both two versions of Planck units.\n\n== Significance ==\nPlanck units are free of [[anthropocentric]] arbitrariness.

[[Frank Wilczek]] puts it succinctly:\n{{bq|We see that the question [posed] is not, \"Why is gravity so feeble?\" but rather, \"Why is the proton's mass so small?\" For in natural (Planck) units, the strength of gravity simply is what it is, a primary quantity, while the proton's mass is the tiny number [1/(13&nbsp;[[Names of large numbers|quintillion]])].<ref>{{cite journal|title=Scaling Mount Planck I: A View from the Bottom|journal=Physics Today|volume=54|issue=6|pages=12\u201313|year=2001|last=Wilczek|first=Frank|doi=10.1063/1.1387576|bibcode=2001PhT....54f..12W}}</ref>}}\n\nWhile it is true that the electrostatic repulsive force between two protons (alone in free space) greatly exceeds the gravitational attractive force between the same two protons, this is not about the relative strengths of the two fundamental forces. From the point of view of Planck units, this is [[comparing apples to oranges]], because [[mass]] and [[electric charge]] are [[Dimensional analysis|incommensurable]] quantities. Rather, the disparity of magnitude of force is a manifestation of the fact that the [[elementary charge|charge on the protons]] is approximately the [[Planck charge|unit charge]] but the [[Proton mass|mass of the protons]] is far less than the [[Planck mass|unit mass]].\n\n=== Cosmology ===\n{{Main|Chronology of the Universe}}\n{{anchor|Planck epoch}}\nIn [[Big Bang cosmology]], the '''Planck epoch''' or '''Planck era''' is the earliest stage of the [[Big Bang]], before the [[cosmic time|time passed]] was equal to the [[Planck time]], ''t''<sub>P</sub>, or approximately 10<sup>\u221243</sup> seconds.<ref name=\"Planck-UOregon\">{{cite web |author=Staff |title=Birth of the Universe |url=http://abyss.uoregon.edu/~js/cosmo/lectures/lec20.html |date= |work=[[University of Oregon]] |accessdate=September 24, 2016 }} - discusses \"[[Planck time]]\" and \"[[Planck era]]\" at the very beginning of the [[Universe]]</ref> There is no currently available physical theory to describe such short times, and it is not clear in what sense the concept of [[time]] is meaningful for values smaller than the Planck time. It is generally assumed that [[quantum gravity|quantum effects of gravity]] dominate physical interactions at this time scale. At this scale, the [[grand unification|unified force]] of the [[Standard Model]] is assumed to be [[Theory of everything|unified with gravitation]]. Immeasurably [[Planck temperature|hot]] and [[Planck density|dense]], the state of the Planck epoch was succeeded by the [[grand unification epoch]], where gravitation is separated from the unified force of the Standard Model, in turn followed by the [[inflationary epoch]], which ended after about 10<sup>\u221232</sup> seconds (or about 10<sup>10</sup>&nbsp;''t''<sub>P</sub>).<ref name=\"KolbTurner1994\">{{cite book|author1=Edward W.

A., 1999, \"[http://old.ihst.ru/personal/tomilin/papers/tomil.pdf Natural Systems of Units: To the Centenary Anniversary of the Planck System]\", 287\u2013296.</ref> At the end of the paper, Planck introduced, as a consequence of his discovery, the base units later named in his honor. The Planck units are based on the quantum of action, now usually known as [[Planck's constant]]. Planck called the constant ''b'' in his paper, though ''h'' (or ''\u0127'') is now common. However, at that time it was entering Wien's radiation law which Planck thought to be correct. Planck underlined the universality of the new unit system, writing:\n{{bq|''...ihre Bedeutung f\u00fcr alle Zeiten und f\u00fcr alle, auch au\u00dferirdische und au\u00dfermenschliche Kulturen notwendig behalten und welche daher als \u00bbnat\u00fcrliche Ma\u00dfeinheiten\u00ab bezeichnet werden k\u00f6nnen...''\n...These necessarily retain their meaning for all times and for all civilizations, even extraterrestrial and non-human ones, and can therefore be designated as \"natural units\"...}}\nPlanck considered only the units based on the universal constants ''G'', ''\u0127'', ''c'', and ''k''<sub>B</sub> to arrive at natural units for [[length]], [[time]], [[mass]], and [[temperature]].<ref name=\"TOM\" /> Planck did not adopt any electromagnetic units. However, since the [[Gaussian units#\"Rationalized\" unit systems|non-rationalized]] gravitational constant, ''G'', is set to 1, a natural extension of Planck units to a unit of [[electric charge]] is to also set the non-rationalized Coulomb constant, ''k''<sub>e</sub>, to 1 as well (as well as the Stoney units).<ref name=\"PAV\">{{cite book|last=Pav\u0161ic|first=Matej|title=The Landscape of Theoretical Physics: A Global View|volume=119|year=2001|publisher=Kluwer Academic|location=Dordrecht|isbn=978-0-7923-7006-2|pages=347\u2013352|url=https://www.springer.com/gp/book/9781402003516#otherversion=9780792370062|series=Fundamental Theories of Physics | doi = 10.1007/0-306-47136-1 |arxiv=gr-qc/0610061}}</ref> This is the non-rationalized Planck units (Planck units with the Gaussian version), which is more convenient but not rationalized, there is also a Planck system which is rationalized (Planck units with the Lorentz\u2013Heaviside version), set 4{{pi}}''G'' and ''\u03b5''<sub>0</sub> (instead of ''G'' and ''k''<sub>e</sub>) to 1, which may be less convenient but is rationalized.

These normalizations are neither the only ones possible nor necessarily the best. Moreover, the choice of what factors to normalize, among the factors appearing in the fundamental equations of physics, is not evident, and the values of the Planck units are sensitive to this choice.\n\nThe factor 4{{pi}} is ubiquitous in [[theoretical physics]] because the surface area of a [[sphere]] of radius ''r'' is 4{{pi}}''r''<sup>2</sup>. This, along with the concept of [[flux]], are the basis for the [[inverse-square law]], [[Gauss's law]], and the [[divergence]] operator applied to [[flux density]]. For example, [[Gravitational field|gravitational]] and [[electrostatic field]]s produced by point charges have spherical symmetry (Barrow 2002: 214\u201315). The 4{{pi}}''r''<sup>2</sup> appearing in the denominator of Coulomb's law in [[Lorentz\u2013Heaviside units#Maxwell's equations with sources|rationalized form]], for example, follows from the flux of an electrostatic field being distributed uniformly on the surface of a sphere. Likewise for Newton's law of universal gravitation. (If space had more than three spatial dimensions, the factor 4{{pi}} would have to be changed according to the geometry of the [[S\u00b2|sphere in higher dimensions]].)\n\nHence a substantial body of physical theory developed since Planck (1899) suggests normalizing not ''G'' but either 4{{pi}}''G'' (or 8{{pi}}''G'' or 16{{pi}}''G'') to 1. Doing so would introduce a factor of {{sfrac|4{{pi}}}} (or {{sfrac|8{{pi}}}} or {{sfrac|16{{pi}}}}) into the nondimensionalized form of the law of universal gravitation, consistent with the modern rationalized formulation of Coulomb's law in terms of the vacuum permittivity. In fact, alternative normalizations frequently preserve the factor of {{sfrac|4{{pi}}}} in the nondimensionalized form of Coulomb's law as well, so that the nondimensionalized Maxwell's equations for electromagnetism and [[gravitoelectromagnetism]] both take the same form as those for electromagnetism in SI, which do not have any factors of 4{{pi}}.  When this is applied to electromagnetic constants, \u03b5<sub>0</sub>, this unit system is called ''\"rationalized\"'' [[Lorentz\u2013Heaviside units]].  When applied additionally to gravitation and Planck units, these are called '''rationalized Planck units'''<ref>{{cite journal|title=Kaluza-Klein Monopole|journal=Physical Review Letters|volume=51|issue=2|pages=87\u201390|year=1983|last=Sorkin|first=Rafael|doi=10.1103/PhysRevLett.51.87|bibcode=1983PhRvL..51...87S}}</ref> and are seen in [https://books.google.com/books?id=1wUFoP7HC38C&pg=PA271&lpg=PA271&dq=elementary+charge+0.3028 high-energy physics].\n\nThe rationalized Planck units are defined so that <math>c=4\\pi G=\\hbar=\\epsilon_0=k_\\text{B}=1</math>. These are the Planck units based on [[Lorentz\u2013Heaviside units]] (instead of on the more conventional [[Gaussian units]]) as depicted above.\n\nThere are several possible alternative normalizations.\n\n=== Gravity ===\n<!-- [[Reduced Planck units]], [[Planck mass]] and [[Cosmological constant]] link to this section -->\nIn 1899, Newton's law of universal gravitation was still seen as exact, rather than as a convenient approximation holding for \"small\" velocities and masses (the approximate nature of Newton's law was shown following the development of [[general relativity]] in 1915). Hence Planck normalized to 1 the [[gravitational constant]] ''G'' in Newton's law. In theories emerging after 1899, ''G'' nearly always appears in formulae multiplied by 4{{pi}} or a small integer multiple thereof. Hence, a choice to be made when designing a system of natural units is which, if any, instances of 4{{pi}} appearing in the equations of physics are to be eliminated via the normalization.\n* Normalizing 4{{pi}}''G'' to 1: (such as the Lorentz\u2013Heaviside version Planck units)\n** [[Newton's law of universal gravitation]] has 4{{pi}}''r''<sup>2</sup> remaining in the denominator (which is the surface area of the enclosing sphere at radius ''r'').\n** [[Gauss's law for gravity]] becomes {{nowrap|1=''\u03a6''<sub>'''g'''</sub> = \u2212''M''}} (rather than {{nowrap|1=''\u03a6''<sub>'''g'''</sub> = \u22124{{pi}}''M''}} in Planck units).\n** Eliminates 4{{pi}}''G'' from the [[Poisson equation]].\n** Eliminates 4{{pi}}''G'' in the [[Gravitoelectromagnetism|gravitoelectromagnetic]] (GEM) equations, which hold in weak [[gravitational field]]s or [[Locally flat spacetime|locally flat space-time]]. These equations have the same form as Maxwell's equations (and the [[Lorentz force]] equation) of [[electromagnetism]], with [[mass density]] replacing [[charge density]], and with {{sfrac|4{{pi}}''G''}} replacing \u03b5<sub>0</sub>.\n** Normalizes the [[characteristic impedance]] ''Z''<sub>0</sub> of [[gravitational radiation]] in free space to 1. (Normally expressed as {{sfrac|4{{pi}}''G''|''c''}}){{NoteTag|[[General relativity]] predicts that [[gravitational radiation]] propagates at the same speed as [[electromagnetic radiation]].}}\n** Eliminates 4{{pi}}''G'' from the [[Bekenstein\u2013Hawking formula]] (for the [[black hole thermodynamics|entropy of a black hole]] in terms of its mass ''m''<sub>BH</sub> and the area of its [[event horizon]] ''A''<sub>BH</sub>) which is simplified to {{nowrap|1=''S''<sub>BH</sub> = {{pi}}''A''<sub>BH</sub> = (''m''<sub>BH</sub>)<sup>2</sup>}}.\n** In this case the [[electron rest mass]], measured in terms of this [[Lorentz\u2013Heaviside units#Rationalization|rationalized]] Planck mass, is\n\n::: <math> m_e = \\sqrt{4 \\pi \\alpha_G} \\cdot m_{\\text{P}} \\approx 1.48368 \\times 10^{-22} \\cdot m_{\\text{P}} \\, </math>\n\n:: where <math> {\\alpha_G} \\ </math> is the [[gravitational coupling constant]].  This convention is seen in high-energy physics.\n\n* Setting {{nowrap|1=8{{pi}}''G'' = 1}}. This would eliminate 8{{pi}}''G'' from the [[Einstein field equations]], [[Einstein\u2013Hilbert action]], and the [[Friedmann equations]], for gravitation. Planck units modified so that {{nowrap|1=8{{pi}}''G'' = 1}} are known as ''reduced Planck units'', because the [[reduced Planck mass|Planck mass]] is divided by {{sqrt|8{{pi}}}}. Also, the Bekenstein\u2013Hawking formula for the entropy of a black hole simplifies to {{nowrap|1=''S''<sub>BH</sub> = (''m''<sub>BH</sub>)<sup>2</sup>/2 = 2{{pi}}''A''<sub>BH</sub>}}.\n* Setting {{nowrap|1=16{{pi}}''G'' = 1}}. This would eliminate the constant {{sfrac|''c''<sup>4</sup>|16{{pi}}''G''}} from the Einstein\u2013Hilbert action. The form of the Einstein field equations with [[cosmological constant]] ''\u039b'' becomes {{nowrap|1=''R<sub>\u03bc\u03bd</sub>'' + ''\u039bg<sub>\u03bc\u03bd</sub>'' = {{sfrac|2}}(''Rg<sub>\u03bc\u03bd</sub>'' + ''T<sub>\u03bc\u03bd</sub>'')}}.\n\n=== Electromagnetism ===\nPlanck units normalize to 1 the [[Coulomb force constant]] ''k''<sub>e</sub> = {{sfrac|4{{pi}}''\u03b5''<sub>0</sub>}} (as does the [[cgs]] system of units).

Such cosmologies have not gained mainstream acceptance and yet there is still considerable scientific interest in the possibility that physical \"constants\" might change, although such propositions introduce difficult questions. Perhaps the first question to address is: How would such a change make a noticeable operational difference in physical measurement or, more fundamentally, our perception of reality? If some particular physical constant had changed, how would we notice it, or how would physical reality be different? Which changed constants result in a meaningful and measurable difference in physical reality? If a [[physical constant]] that is not [[dimensionless]], such as the [[speed of light]], ''did'' in fact change, would we be able to notice it or measure it unambiguously? \u2013 a question examined by [[Michael Duff (physicist)|Michael Duff]] in his paper \"Comment on time-variation of fundamental constants\".<ref name=\"hep-th0208093\">{{cite journal|author=Michael Duff |title=How fundamental are fundamental constants?|arxiv=1412.2040|doi=10.1080/00107514.2014.980093|author-link=Michael Duff (physicist)|doi-broken-date=2020-03-21|url=https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/00107514.2014.980093|journal=Contemporary Physics|volume=56|issue=1|pages=35\u201347|year=2015}}</ref>\n\n[[George Gamow]] argued in his book ''[[Mr Tompkins in Wonderland]]'' that a sufficient change in a dimensionful physical constant, such as the speed of light in a vacuum, would result in obvious perceptible changes. But this idea is challenged:\n\n{{quotation|[An] important lesson we learn from the way that pure numbers like ''\u03b1'' define the world is what it really means for worlds to be different. The pure number we call the fine structure constant and denote by ''\u03b1'' is a combination of the electron charge, ''e'', the speed of light, ''c'', and Planck's constant, ''h''. At first we might be tempted to think that a world in which the speed of light was slower would be a different world. But this would be a mistake. If ''c'', ''h'', and ''e'' were all changed so that the values they have in metric (or any other) units were different when we looked them up in our tables of physical constants, but the value of ''\u03b1'' remained the same, this new world would be ''observationally indistinguishable'' from our world. The only thing that counts in the definition of worlds are the values of the dimensionless constants of Nature.

When one commonly measures a length with a ruler or tape-measure, that person is actually counting tick marks on a given standard or is measuring the length relative to that given standard, which is a dimensionless value. It is no different for physical experiments, as all physical quantities are measured relative to some other like-dimensioned quantity.\n\nWe can notice a difference if some dimensionless physical quantity such as [[fine-structure constant]], ''\u03b1'', changes or the [[proton-to-electron mass ratio]], {{sfrac|''m''<sub>p</sub>|''m''<sub>e</sub>}}, changes (atomic structures would change) but if all dimensionless physical quantities remained unchanged (this includes all possible ratios of identically dimensioned physical quantity), we cannot tell if a dimensionful quantity, such as the [[speed of light]], ''c'', has changed. And, indeed, the Tompkins concept becomes meaningless in our perception of reality if a dimensional quantity such as ''c'' [[Variable speed of light|has changed]], even drastically.\n\nIf the speed of light ''c'', were somehow suddenly cut in half and changed to {{sfrac|2}}''c'' (but with the axiom that ''all'' dimensionless physical quantities remain the same), then the Planck length would ''increase'' by a factor of 2{{sqrt|2}} from the point of view of some unaffected observer on the outside. Measured by \"mortal\" observers in terms of Planck units, the new speed of light would remain as 1 new Planck length per 1 new Planck time \u2013 which is no different from the old measurement. But, since by axiom, the size of atoms (approximately the [[Bohr radius]]) are related to the Planck length by an unchanging dimensionless constant of proportionality:\n\n: <math>a_0 = \\frac{4 \\pi \\epsilon_0 \\hbar^2}{m_e e^2} = \\frac{m_\\text{P}}{m_e \\alpha} l_\\text{P}. </math>\n\nThen atoms would be bigger (in one dimension) by 2{{sqrt|2}}, each of us would be taller by 2{{sqrt|2}}, and so would our metre sticks be taller (and wider and thicker) by a factor of 2{{sqrt|2}}. Our perception of distance and lengths relative to the Planck length is, by axiom, an unchanging dimensionless constant.\n\nOur clocks would tick slower by a factor of 4{{sqrt|2}} (from the point of view of this unaffected observer on the outside) because the Planck time has increased by 4{{sqrt|2}} but we would not know the difference (our perception of durations of time relative to the Planck time is, by axiom, an unchanging dimensionless constant). This hypothetical unaffected observer on the outside might observe that light now propagates at half the speed that it previously did (as well as all other observed velocities) but it would still travel {{val|299792458}} of our ''new'' metres in the time elapsed by one of our ''new'' seconds ({{sfrac|2}}''c'' \u00d7 4{{sqrt|2}} \u00f7 2{{sqrt|2}} continues to equal {{val|299792458|u=m/s}}). We would not notice any difference.\n\nThis contradicts what [[George Gamow]] writes in his book ''[[Mr. Tompkins]]''; there, Gamow suggests that if a dimension-dependent universal constant such as ''c'' changed significantly, we ''would'' easily notice the difference. The disagreement is better thought of as the ambiguity in the phrase ''\"changing a physical constant\"''; what would happen depends on whether (1)&nbsp;all other ''dimensionless'' constants were kept the same, or whether (2)&nbsp;all other dimension-''dependent'' constants are kept the same. The second choice is a somewhat confusing possibility, since most of our units of measurement are defined in relation to the outcomes of physical experiments, and the experimental results depend on the constants. Gamow does not address this subtlety; the thought experiments he conducts in his popular works assume the second choice for ''\"changing a physical constant\"''. And Duff or Barrow would point out that ascribing a change in measurable reality, i.e. [[fine-structure constant|''\u03b1'']], to a specific dimensional component quantity, such as [[speed of light|''c'']], is unjustified. The very same operational difference in measurement or perceived reality could just as well be caused by a change in [[Planck constant|''h'']] or [[elementary charge|''e'']] if ''\u03b1'' is changed and no other dimensionless constants are changed.  It is only the dimensionless physical constants that ultimately matter in the definition of worlds.<ref name=\"hep-th0208093\" /><ref>[[John Baez]] [http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/constants.html How Many Fundamental Constants Are There?]</ref>\n\nThis unvarying aspect of the Planck-relative scale, or that of any other system of natural units, leads many theorists to conclude that a hypothetical change in dimensionful physical constants can only be manifest as a change in [[dimensionless physical constant]]s.

It takes its common and scientific names from the distinctive yellow stripes on the sides of its head. Its loud, clear call often begins twenty or thirty minutes before dawn. It is widespread across eastern and southeastern Australia, in open [[sclerophyll]] forests from coastal dunes to high-altitude [[subalpine area]]s, and [[woodland]]s along creeks and rivers. Comparatively short-billed for a honeyeater, it is thought to have adapted to a diet of flies, spiders, and beetles, as well as nectar and pollen from the flowers of plants, such as ''[[Banksia]]'' and ''[[Grevillea]]'', and soft fruits. It catches insects in flight as well as [[Gleaning (birds)|gleaning]] them from the foliage of trees and shrubs.\n\nSome yellow-faced honeyeaters are sedentary, but hundreds of thousands [[bird migration|migrate]] northwards between March and May to spend the winter in southern [[Queensland]], and return in July and August to breed in southern [[New South Wales]] and [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]]. They form [[Monogamy in animals|socially monogamous]] pairs and lay two or three eggs in a delicate [[cup nest|cup-shaped nest]]. The success rate can be low, and the pairs nest several times during the breeding season.\n\nHoneyeaters' preferred woodland habitat is vulnerable to the effects of land-clearing, grazing, and weeds. As it is common and widespread, the yellow-faced honeyeater is considered by the [[International Union for Conservation of Nature]] (IUCN) to be of [[least concern]] for conservation. It is considered a pest in orchards in some areas.\n\n==Taxonomy==\nThe yellow-faced honeyeater was first [[species description|described]], and placed in the genus ''[[Typical warbler|Sylvia]]'', by ornithologist, [[John Latham (ornithologist)|John Latham]], in his 1801 work, ''Supplementum Indicis Ornithologici, sive Systematis Ornithologiae''.<ref name=latham01>{{cite book | last=Latham | first=John | author-link=John Latham (ornithologist) | year=1801 | title=Supplementum indicis ornithologici sive systematis ornithologiae | place=London | publisher=Leigh & Sotheby | language=Latin | page=liv | url=https://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/page/33261428 }}</ref><ref name=Latham>{{cite journal | last = Schodde| first = Richard | authorlink = Richard Schodde |author2=Dickinson, Edward C. |author3=Steinheimer, Frank D. |author4=Bock, Walter J.  | title = The date of Latham's ''Supplementum Indicis Ornithologici'': 1801 or 1802? | journal = South Australian Ornithologist | volume = 35| issue = 8 | pages = 231\u2013235 | year = 2010| url=http://www.birdssa.asn.au/images/saopdfs/Volume35/2010V35P231.pdf }}</ref> French ornithologist, [[Louis Jean Pierre Vieillot]], described it as ''Melithreptus gilvicapillus'' in 1817, and English zoologist, [[George Robert Gray]], as ''Ptilotis trivirgata'' in 1869.<ref name=\"AFD\">{{cite web|url=https://biodiversity.org.au/afd/taxa/f27e5973-dc69-40d0-af23-ae1c49d6e0b3|title=Subspecies ''Caligavis chrysops chrysops'' (Latham, 1801)|author=Australian Biological Resources Study|date=13 October 2014|work=Australian Faunal Directory|publisher=Department of the Environment, Water, Heritage and the Arts, Australian Government|accessdate=7 January 2017|location=Canberra, Australian Capital Territory}}</ref> The specific name ''chrysops'' is derived from the [[Ancient Greek]] words ''chrysos'' meaning 'gold' and ''prosopo'' meaning 'face', in reference to the stripe of yellow feathers.<ref name=fraser13>{{cite book|last1=Gray|first1=Jeannie|last2=Fraser|first2=Ian|title=Australian Bird Names: A Complete Guide|url=https://books.google.com/?id=W1TCqHVWQp0C&pg=PT199#v=onepage&q=Yellow-faced%20honeyeater%20&f=false|year=2013|publisher=Csiro Publishing|location=Collingwood, Victoria | isbn=978-0-643-10471-6|page=199}}</ref>\n\nThe yellow-faced honeyeater was classified in the genera ''[[Meliphaga]]'' and then ''[[Lichenostomus]]'' until 2011.<ref name=\"AFD\"/> Delineating the latter genus had been systematically contentious, and evaluations of relationships among honeyeaters in the genus, using dense [[taxon]] and [[nucleotide]] sampling, confirmed previous findings that ''Lichenostomus'' is not [[Monophyly|monophyletic]].<ref name =Gardener>{{cite journal| last = Gardner | first = J.L.  | last2 = Trueman |first2=J.W.H. |last3=Ebert|first3=D. |last4=Joseph |first4=L. |last5=Magrath|first5=R.D. | title = Phylogeny and evolution of the ''Meliphagoidea'', the largest radiation of Australian songbirds  | journal = Molecular Phylogenetics and Evolution | volume = 55 | issue =  3| pages = 1087\u20131102 | year = 2010 | issn = 1055-7903  | doi = 10.1016/j.ympev.2010.02.005\n| pmid = 20152917}}</ref> Five species have previously been described as comprising the ''Caligavis'' subgroup, but studies, using the [[Mitochondrial DNA|mitochondrial]] DNA, identified the yellow-faced honeyeater as most closely related to the [[black-throated honeyeater]] (''C. subfrenatus'') and the [[obscure honeyeater]] (''C. obscurus'') of New Guinea; they were, therefore, grouped into the genus ''[[Caligavis]]''.

Above the yellow stripe is a black eye stripe which is broken by a small yellow to off-white patch behind the eye, and below is another distinct black stripe running the length of the yellow line. The chin, throat, and breast are a pale greyish-brown, streaked with slightly darker grey, and the abdomen is light grey. The upper body is a dark greyish-brown to olive-brown. Olive-green outer edges on the [[Flight feather|remiges]] combine to form an olive panel on the folded wing. The bill is black and slightly down-curved, and the gape is cream. The legs and feet are grey-brown. The [[Iris (anatomy)|iris]] is a dusky blue in adult birds, and brown in juveniles. The juvenile is very similar to the adult, with slightly less streaking on the breast, an orange-brown tip on the bill, and a yellower gape; male and female birds are also similar, with the male being slightly larger (on average, {{convert|0.8|g|oz|abbr=on}} heavier); and in the field there are no visible differences between the subspecies. The yellow-faced honeyeater averages {{convert|15|-|17.5|cm|in}} in length, with a wingspan of {{convert|21.5|-|26|cm|in|abbr=on}}, and a weight of {{convert|12.5|-|20.5|g|oz}}, with an average of {{convert|17|g|oz|abbr=on}}).{{sfn|Higgins|Christidis|Ford|2008|p=597}}{{sfn|Higgins|Peter|Steele|2001|p=724}}\n\n===Vocalizations===\nOne of the first birds heard in the morning, the yellow-faced honeyeater utters calls that are full and loud, and extremely varied.

It has been recorded in coastal [[heath]] when banksias are blooming, and among flowering [[mangrove]]s. It occupies areas infested with weeds, such as Scotch broom (''[[Cytisus scoparius]]'') and [[Blackberry|blackberries]], and in developed areas including orchards, parks and gardens, where it feeds on cultivated fruit and flowers.

It takes its common and scientific names from the distinctive yellow stripes on the sides of its head. Its loud, clear call often begins twenty or thirty minutes before dawn. It is widespread across eastern and southeastern Australia, in open [[sclerophyll]] forests from coastal dunes to high-altitude [[subalpine area]]s, and [[woodland]]s along creeks and rivers. Comparatively short-billed for a honeyeater, it is thought to have adapted to a diet of flies, spiders, and beetles, as well as nectar and pollen from the flowers of plants, such as ''[[Banksia]]'' and ''[[Grevillea]]'', and soft fruits. It catches insects in flight as well as [[Gleaning (birds)|gleaning]] them from the foliage of trees and shrubs.\n\nSome yellow-faced honeyeaters are sedentary, but hundreds of thousands [[bird migration|migrate]] northwards between March and May to spend the winter in southern [[Queensland]], and return in July and August to breed in southern [[New South Wales]] and [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]]. They form [[Monogamy in animals|socially monogamous]] pairs and lay two or three eggs in a delicate [[cup nest|cup-shaped nest]]. The success rate can be low, and the pairs nest several times during the breeding season.\n\nHoneyeaters' preferred woodland habitat is vulnerable to the effects of land-clearing, grazing, and weeds.

Above the yellow stripe is a black eye stripe which is broken by a small yellow to off-white patch behind the eye, and below is another distinct black stripe running the length of the yellow line. The chin, throat, and breast are a pale greyish-brown, streaked with slightly darker grey, and the abdomen is light grey. The upper body is a dark greyish-brown to olive-brown. Olive-green outer edges on the [[Flight feather|remiges]] combine to form an olive panel on the folded wing. The bill is black and slightly down-curved, and the gape is cream. The legs and feet are grey-brown. The [[Iris (anatomy)|iris]] is a dusky blue in adult birds, and brown in juveniles. The juvenile is very similar to the adult, with slightly less streaking on the breast, an orange-brown tip on the bill, and a yellower gape; male and female birds are also similar, with the male being slightly larger (on average, {{convert|0.8|g|oz|abbr=on}} heavier); and in the field there are no visible differences between the subspecies. The yellow-faced honeyeater averages {{convert|15|-|17.5|cm|in}} in length, with a wingspan of {{convert|21.5|-|26|cm|in|abbr=on}}, and a weight of {{convert|12.5|-|20.5|g|oz}}, with an average of {{convert|17|g|oz|abbr=on}}).{{sfn|Higgins|Christidis|Ford|2008|p=597}}{{sfn|Higgins|Peter|Steele|2001|p=724}}\n\n===Vocalizations===\nOne of the first birds heard in the morning, the yellow-faced honeyeater utters calls that are full and loud, and extremely varied.
