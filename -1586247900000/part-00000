An isolated, agrarian society until the mid-20th century, [[Nepal]] entered the modern era in 1951 without schools, hospitals, roads, [[telecommunications]], electric power, industry, or civil service. The country has, however, made progress toward [[sustainable economic growth]] since the 1950s and opened the country to economic liberalization leading to economic growth and improvement in living standards than compared to the past. The biggest challenges faced by the country in achieving higher economic development are the frequent changes in political leadership as well as corruption.\n\nNepal has used a [[Five-year plans of Nepal|series of five-year plans]] in an attempt to make progress in economic development.  It completed its ninth economic development plan in 2002; its currency has been made convertible, and 17 state enterprises have been privatised. [[Foreign aid to Nepal]] accounts for more than half of the development budget. Government priorities over the years have been the development of transportation and communication facilities, agriculture, and industry. Since 1975, improved government administration and rural development efforts have been emphasised.\n\n[[Agriculture]] remains Nepal's principal economic activity, employing about 65% of the population and providing 31.7% of [[gross domestic product|GDP]]. Only about 20% of the total area is cultivable; another 40.7% is forested (i.e., covered by shrubs, pastureland and forest); most of the rest is mountainous. Fruits and vegetables (apples, pears, tomatoes, various salads, peach, nectarine, potatoes), as well as rice and wheat are the main food crops. The lowland Terai region produces an agricultural surplus, part of which supplies the food-deficient hill areas.\n\nGDP is heavily dependent on [[remittances]] (9.1%) of foreign workers.  Subsequently, economic development in social services and infrastructure in Nepal has not made dramatic progress. A countrywide primary education system is under development, and [[Tribhuvan University]] has several campuses. Although eradication efforts continue, [[malaria]] had been controlled in the fertile but previously uninhabitable Terai region in the south. [[Kathmandu]] is linked to [[India]] and nearby hill regions by road and an expanding highway network. The capital was almost out of fuel and transport of supplies caused by a crippling general strike in southern Nepal on 17 February 2008.<ref>[http://edition.cnn.com/2008/WORLD/asiapcf/02/17/nepal.ap/index.html Kathmandu nearly out of fuel, Nepal says]. ''CNN''. 17 February 2008. Retrieved 2008-04-13.</ref>\n\nMajor towns are connected to the capital by telephone and domestic air services. The export-oriented carpet and garment industries have grown rapidly in recent years and together now account for approximately 70% of merchandise exports.\n\nThe [[Cost of Living Index]] in Nepal is comparatively lower than many countries but not the least. The quality of life has declined to much less desirous value in recent years.<ref name=\"CoLI\">[http://ekendraonline.com/nepal/cost-living-index-nepal/  Cost of Living Index in Nepal  - Statistics & Graphs of Nepalese Citizen's Economic Power].

Accordingly, a large number of foreign companies are in line, but political instability has stopped the process at the same time as it is growing on its own.\nNepal has entered into agreements for avoidance of double taxation (all in credit method) with 10 countries ([https://web.archive.org/web/20111104182119/http://bndahal.hpage.com/ PSRD]) since 2000. Similarly, it has [[Investment protection]] agreements with 5 countries ([https://web.archive.org/web/20111104182119/http://bndahal.hpage.com/ PSRD]) since 1983. In 2014, Nepal restricted the [[Foreign aid]] by setting a minimum limit for foreign grants, soft and commercial loans from its development partners.<ref>{{cite web|title=Nepal puts a minimum amount limit on foreign aid and loans |url=http://news.biharprabha.com/2014/07/nepal-puts-a-minimum-amount-limit-on-foreign-aid-and-loans/|work=IANS|publisher=news.biharprabha.com|accessdate=3 July 2014}}</ref>\n\n==Imports and exports==\n[[File:Nepal treemap.png|thumb|350px|A proportional representation of Nepal's exports.]]\nNepal's merchandise trade balance has improved somewhat since 2000 with the growth of the carpet and garment industries. In the fiscal year 2000\u20132001, exports posted a greater increase (14%) than imports (4.5%), helping bring the [[trade deficit]] down by 4% from the previous year to $749 million. Recently, the [[European Union]] has become the largest buyer of ready-made garments; fruits and vegetables (mostly apples, pears, tomatoes, various salads, peach, nectarine, potatoes, rice) from Nepal. Exports to the EU accounted for 46.13 percent of the country's garment exports.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ktm2day.com/2011/10/11/eu-is-largest-buyer-of-nepali-garments/|title=EU as Nepal's largest exporter |publisher=ktm2day |date= |accessdate=11 October 2011}}</ref>\n\nThe annual monsoon rain, or lack of it, strongly influences economic growth. From 1996 to 1999, real GDP growth averaged less than 4%. The growth rate recovered in 1999, rising to 6% before slipping slightly in 2001 to 5.5%.\n\nStrong export performance, including earnings from tourism, and external aid have helped improve the overall balance of payments and increase international reserves. Nepal receives substantial amounts of external assistance from the [[United Kingdom]],<ref>{{cite news|title=UK should cut aid to Nepal if \"endemic\" corruption persists: report|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2015/03/27/us-britain-nepal-aid-corruption-idUSKBN0MN00F20150327|accessdate=16 May 2015|work=Reuters|date=27 March 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=DFID's bilateral programme in Nepal|url=https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201415/cmselect/cmintdev/854/85403.htm|publisher=The [[International Development Committee]] of the House of Commons|accessdate=17 May 2015|date=27 March 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=A Conversation with Departing Nepal Chief of the UK Aid Agency|url=http://blog.com.np/2013/06/15/a-conversation-with-departing-nepal-chief-of-the-uk-aid-agency/|website=United We Blog! for a Democratic Nepal|accessdate=16 May 2015|date=15 June 2013}}</ref> the [[United States]], [[Japan]], [[Germany]], and the [[Scandinavia]]n countries.\n\nSeveral multilateral organisations such as the [[World Bank]], the [[Asian Development Bank]], and the [[UN Development Programme]] also provide assistance. In June 1998, Nepal submitted its memorandum on a foreign trade regime to the [[World Trade Organization]] and in May 2000 began direct negotiations on its accession.\n\n==Resources==\n[[File:Tourists trekking in Annapurna region.jpg|thumb|right|Tourists trekking in [[Annapurna]] region in western [[Nepal]]. Tourism plays a vital role in Nepal's economy.]]\nProgress has been made in exploiting Nepal's natural resources, [[tourism]] and [[hydroelectricity]]. With eight of the world's 10 highest mountain peaks, including [[Mount Everest]] at 8,848 m. In the early 1990s, one large public sector project and a number of private projects were planned; some have been completed. The most significant private sector financed hydroelectric projects currently in operation are the [[Khimti Khola]] (60 MW) and the [[Bhote Koshi Project]] (36 MW). The project is still undergoing and has dependency on China, India and Japan to take the further steps.\n\nNepal has 83,000 MW of theoretical and 42,133 MW of technically/financially viable hydroelectric potential, however the total installed capacity, at present, is mere 730.47 MW.<ref>{{cite web|title=Nepali Political parties criticize Indian Hydel Power proposal|url=http://news.biharprabha.com/2014/07/nepali-political-parties-criticize-indian-hydel-power-proposal/|work=IANS|publisher=news.biharprabha.com|accessdate=20 July 2014}}</ref>\n\nThe environmental impact of Nepal's hydroelectric Own calendar (Bikram Sambat) New year in mid- April projects has been limited by the fact that most are \"[[Run-of-the-river hydroelectricity|run-of-the-river]]\" with only one storage project undertaken to date. The largest hydroelectric plant under consideration is the [[West Seti Dam]] (750 MW) storage project dedicated to exports to be built by the private sector. Negotiations with India for a [[power purchase agreement]] have been underway for several years, but agreement on pricing and financing remains a problem. Currently demand for electricity is increasing at 8-10% a year whereas Nepal's option to have agreement with India will make this fulfilment against demand.\n\nPopulation pressure on natural resources is increasing. Over-population is already straining the \"carrying capacity\" of the middle hill areas, particularly the Kathmandu Valley, resulting in the depletion of forest cover for crops, fuel, and fodder and contributing to erosion and flooding. Although steep mountain terrain makes exploitation difficult, [[mineral]] surveys have found small deposits of [[limestone]], [[magnesite]], [[zinc]], [[copper]], [[iron]], [[mica]], [[lead]], and [[cobalt]].\n\nThe development of hydroelectric power projects also cause some tension with local indigenous groups, recently{{when|date=February 2011}} empowered by Nepal's ratification of [[ILO 169|ILO Convention 169]].<ref>[http://blog.nibrinternational.no/#post13 Jones, Peris: When the lights go out.

An isolated, agrarian society until the mid-20th century, [[Nepal]] entered the modern era in 1951 without schools, hospitals, roads, [[telecommunications]], electric power, industry, or civil service. The country has, however, made progress toward [[sustainable economic growth]] since the 1950s and opened the country to economic liberalization leading to economic growth and improvement in living standards than compared to the past. The biggest challenges faced by the country in achieving higher economic development are the frequent changes in political leadership as well as corruption.\n\nNepal has used a [[Five-year plans of Nepal|series of five-year plans]] in an attempt to make progress in economic development.  It completed its ninth economic development plan in 2002; its currency has been made convertible, and 17 state enterprises have been privatised. [[Foreign aid to Nepal]] accounts for more than half of the development budget. Government priorities over the years have been the development of transportation and communication facilities, agriculture, and industry. Since 1975, improved government administration and rural development efforts have been emphasised.\n\n[[Agriculture]] remains Nepal's principal economic activity, employing about 65% of the population and providing 31.7% of [[gross domestic product|GDP]]. Only about 20% of the total area is cultivable; another 40.7% is forested (i.e., covered by shrubs, pastureland and forest); most of the rest is mountainous. Fruits and vegetables (apples, pears, tomatoes, various salads, peach, nectarine, potatoes), as well as rice and wheat are the main food crops. The lowland Terai region produces an agricultural surplus, part of which supplies the food-deficient hill areas.\n\nGDP is heavily dependent on [[remittances]] (9.1%) of foreign workers.  Subsequently, economic development in social services and infrastructure in Nepal has not made dramatic progress. A countrywide primary education system is under development, and [[Tribhuvan University]] has several campuses. Although eradication efforts continue, [[malaria]] had been controlled in the fertile but previously uninhabitable Terai region in the south. [[Kathmandu]] is linked to [[India]] and nearby hill regions by road and an expanding highway network. The capital was almost out of fuel and transport of supplies caused by a crippling general strike in southern Nepal on 17 February 2008.<ref>[http://edition.cnn.com/2008/WORLD/asiapcf/02/17/nepal.ap/index.html Kathmandu nearly out of fuel, Nepal says]. ''CNN''. 17 February 2008. Retrieved 2008-04-13.</ref>\n\nMajor towns are connected to the capital by telephone and domestic air services. The export-oriented carpet and garment industries have grown rapidly in recent years and together now account for approximately 70% of merchandise exports.\n\nThe [[Cost of Living Index]] in Nepal is comparatively lower than many countries but not the least. The quality of life has declined to much less desirous value in recent years.<ref name=\"CoLI\">[http://ekendraonline.com/nepal/cost-living-index-nepal/  Cost of Living Index in Nepal  - Statistics & Graphs of Nepalese Citizen's Economic Power].

Accordingly, a large number of foreign companies are in line, but political instability has stopped the process at the same time as it is growing on its own.\nNepal has entered into agreements for avoidance of double taxation (all in credit method) with 10 countries ([https://web.archive.org/web/20111104182119/http://bndahal.hpage.com/ PSRD]) since 2000. Similarly, it has [[Investment protection]] agreements with 5 countries ([https://web.archive.org/web/20111104182119/http://bndahal.hpage.com/ PSRD]) since 1983. In 2014, Nepal restricted the [[Foreign aid]] by setting a minimum limit for foreign grants, soft and commercial loans from its development partners.<ref>{{cite web|title=Nepal puts a minimum amount limit on foreign aid and loans |url=http://news.biharprabha.com/2014/07/nepal-puts-a-minimum-amount-limit-on-foreign-aid-and-loans/|work=IANS|publisher=news.biharprabha.com|accessdate=3 July 2014}}</ref>\n\n==Imports and exports==\n[[File:Nepal treemap.png|thumb|350px|A proportional representation of Nepal's exports.]]\nNepal's merchandise trade balance has improved somewhat since 2000 with the growth of the carpet and garment industries. In the fiscal year 2000-2001, exports posted a greater increase (14%) than imports (4.5%), helping bring the [[trade deficit]] down by 4% from the previous year to $749 million. Recently, the [[European Union]] has become the largest buyer of ready-made garments; fruits and vegetables (mostly apples, pears, tomatoes, various salads, peach, nectarine, potatoes, rice) from Nepal. Exports to the EU accounted for 46.13 percent of the country\u2019s garment exports.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ktm2day.com/2011/10/11/eu-is-largest-buyer-of-nepali-garments/|title=EU as Nepal's largest exporter |publisher=ktm2day |date= |accessdate=11 October 2011}}</ref>\n\nThe annual monsoon rain, or lack of it, strongly influences economic growth. From 1996 to 1999, real GDP growth averaged less than 4%. The growth rate recovered in 1999, rising to 6% before slipping slightly in 2001 to 5.5%.\n\nStrong export performance, including earnings from tourism, and external aid have helped improve the overall balance of payments and increase international reserves. Nepal receives substantial amounts of external assistance from the [[United Kingdom]],<ref>{{cite news|title=UK should cut aid to Nepal if \"endemic\" corruption persists: report|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2015/03/27/us-britain-nepal-aid-corruption-idUSKBN0MN00F20150327|accessdate=16 May 2015|work=Reuters|date=27 March 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=DFID's bilateral programme in Nepal|url=https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201415/cmselect/cmintdev/854/85403.htm|publisher=The [[International Development Committee]] of the House of Commons|accessdate=17 May 2015|date=27 March 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=A Conversation with Departing Nepal Chief of the UK Aid Agency|url=http://blog.com.np/2013/06/15/a-conversation-with-departing-nepal-chief-of-the-uk-aid-agency/|website=United We Blog! for a Democratic Nepal|accessdate=16 May 2015|date=15 June 2013}}</ref> the [[United States]], [[Japan]], [[Germany]], and the [[Scandinavia]]n countries.\n\nSeveral multilateral organisations such as the [[World Bank]], the [[Asian Development Bank]], and the [[UN Development Programme]] also provide assistance. In June 1998, Nepal submitted its memorandum on a foreign trade regime to the [[World Trade Organization]] and in May 2000 began direct negotiations on its accession.\n\n==Resources==\n[[File:Tourists trekking in Annapurna region.jpg|thumb|right|Tourists trekking in [[Annapurna]] region in western [[Nepal]]. Tourism plays a vital role in Nepal's economy.]]\nProgress has been made in exploiting Nepal's natural resources, [[tourism]] and [[hydroelectricity]]. With eight of the world's 10 highest mountain peaks, including [[Mount Everest]] at 8,848 m. In the early 1990s, one large public sector project and a number of private projects were planned; some have been completed. The most significant private sector financed hydroelectric projects currently in operation are the [[Khimti Khola]] (60 MW) and the [[Bhote Koshi Project]] (36 MW). The project is still undergoing and has dependency on China, India and Japan to take the further steps.\n\nNepal has 83,000 MW of theoretical and 42,133 MW of technically/financially viable hydroelectric potential, however the total installed capacity, at present, is mere 730.47 MW.<ref>{{cite web|title=Nepali Political parties criticize Indian Hydel Power proposal|url=http://news.biharprabha.com/2014/07/nepali-political-parties-criticize-indian-hydel-power-proposal/|work=IANS|publisher=news.biharprabha.com|accessdate=20 July 2014}}</ref>\n\nThe environmental impact of Nepal's hydroelectric Own calendar (Bikram Sambat) New year in mid- April projects has been limited by the fact that most are \"[[Run-of-the-river hydroelectricity|run-of-the-river]]\" with only one storage project undertaken to date. The largest hydroelectric plant under consideration is the [[West Seti Dam]] (750 MW) storage project dedicated to exports to be built by the private sector. Negotiations with India for a [[power purchase agreement]] have been underway for several years, but agreement on pricing and financing remains a problem. Currently demand for electricity is increasing at 8-10% a year whereas Nepal's option to have agreement with India will make this fulfilment against demand.\n\nPopulation pressure on natural resources is increasing. Over-population is already straining the \"carrying capacity\" of the middle hill areas, particularly the Kathmandu Valley, resulting in the depletion of forest cover for crops, fuel, and fodder and contributing to erosion and flooding. Although steep mountain terrain makes exploitation difficult, [[mineral]] surveys have found small deposits of [[limestone]], [[magnesite]], [[zinc]], [[copper]], [[iron]], [[mica]], [[lead]], and [[cobalt]].\n\nThe development of hydroelectric power projects also cause some tension with local indigenous groups, recently{{when|date=February 2011}} empowered by Nepal's ratification of [[ILO 169|ILO Convention 169]].<ref>[http://blog.nibrinternational.no/#post13 Jones, Peris: When the lights go out.

The organisation could mobilise supporters to confront the authorities of the protectorate in order to advance the demands that it made of the French government. The movement's strategy alternated between negotiations and armed confrontations over the years. Support from the powerful trade unions and the feminist movement, along with an intellectual and musical cultural revival, contributed to a strong assertion of national identity which was reinforced by the educational and political systems after independence.\n\nThe movement was composed of many diverse groups, but from the 1930s was united by mounting social forces: a lower-middle class engaged in the capitalist economy, new Westernised elites, and an organised working class sensitive to social demands.<ref>Blandine Destremau, Agn\u00e8s Deboulet et Fran\u00e7ois Ireton, ''Dynamiques de la pauvret\u00e9 en Afrique du Nord et au Moyen-Orient'', \u00e9d.

He was the most popular saint in England for nearly two centuries, having gained fame for the many stories of his greatness, not least among which were those concerning his famed cunning in defeating the [[Devil in Christianity|devil]].{{sfn|Toke|1909}}\n\n==Early life (909\u201343)==\n===Birth===\nDunstan was born in [[Baltonsborough]], [[Somerset]], at the time part of the kingdom of [[Wessex]].{{sfn|Dunning|1983|p=}} He was the son of Heorstan, a noble of [[Wessex]]. Heorstan was the brother of [[Athelm]], the bishop of [[Bishop of Bath and Wells|Wells]] and [[Bishop of Winchester|Winchester]].{{sfn|Green|1895|p=121}} It is recorded that his mother, Cynethryth, was a pious woman. Osbern's ''Life of Dunstan'' relates that a messenger miraculously told her of the saintly child she would give birth to:\n\n{{quote|She was in the church of St Mary on Candleday, when all the lights were suddenly extinguished. Then the candle held by Cynethryth was as suddenly relighted, and all present lit their candles at this miraculous flame, thus foreshadowing that the boy \"would be the minister of eternal light\" to the Church of England.|source={{harvnb|Toke|1909}}}}\n\nThe anonymous author of the earliest ''Life'' places Dunstan's birth during the reign of [[Athelstan of England|Athelstan]], while Osbern fixed it at \"the first year of the reign of King \u00c6thelstan\", 924 or 925. This date, however, cannot be reconciled with other known dates of Dunstan's life and creates many obvious [[anachronism]]s. Historians therefore assume that Dunstan was born around 910 or earlier.{{sfn|Lapidge|1999|p=|loc=\"Dunstan\"}}\n\n===School to the king's court===\nAs a young boy, Dunstan studied under the [[Hiberno-Scottish mission|Irish monks]] who then occupied the ruins of [[Glastonbury Abbey]].<ref name=\"co\" /> Accounts tell of his youthful optimism and of his vision of the abbey being restored. While still a boy, Dunstan was stricken with a near-fatal illness and effected a seemingly miraculous recovery. Even as a child, he was noted for his devotion to learning and for his mastery of many kinds of artistic craftsmanship. With his parents' consent he was [[tonsure]]d, received [[minor orders]] and served in the ancient church of St Mary. He became so well known for his devotion to learning that he is said to have been summoned by his uncle Athelm, the [[Archbishop of Canterbury]], to enter his service.{{sfn|Toke|1909}} He was later appointed to the court of King [[Athelstan]].{{sfn|Cross|Livingstone|1997|p=514}}\n[[Image:Dunstan2.jpg|thumbnail|left|Dunstan playing his harp as the Devil is paying a visit]]\n\nDunstan soon became a [[favourite]] of the king and was the envy of other members of the court.{{sfn|Toke|1909}} A plot was hatched to disgrace him and Dunstan was accused of being involved with [[witchcraft]] and [[black magic]].{{sfn|Bunson|Bunson|Bunson|1998|p=}} The king ordered him to leave the court and as Dunstan was leaving the palace his enemies physically attacked him, beat him severely, bound him, and threw him into a [[cesspit|cesspool]].<ref name=\"cw\" /> He managed to crawl out and make his way to the house of a friend. From there, he journeyed to Winchester and entered the service of his uncle, [[Alphege the Bald|\u00c6lfheah]], Bishop of Winchester.{{sfn|Toke|1909}}\n\nThe bishop tried to persuade him to become a [[monk]], but Dunstan was doubtful whether he had a vocation to a [[Clerical celibacy|celibate]] life. The answer came in the form of an attack of swelling tumours all over Dunstan's body. This ailment was so severe that it was thought to be [[leprosy]].{{sfn|Toke|1909}} It was more probably some form of [[bacteremia|blood poisoning]] caused by being beaten and thrown in the cesspool.<ref name=\"cw\"/> Whatever the cause, it changed Dunstan's mind. He took [[Holy Orders]] in 943, in the presence of \u00c6lfheah, and returned to live the life of a hermit at Glastonbury.{{sfn|Toke|1909}} Against the old church of St Mary he built a small cell five feet long and two and a half feet deep. It was there that Dunstan studied, worked at his handicrafts, and played on his harp.{{sfn|Toke|1909}} It is at this time, according to a late 11th-century legend, that the [[Devil in Christianity|Devil]] is said to have tempted Dunstan and to have been held by the face with Dunstan's tongs.<ref name=\"cw\"/>\n\n==Monk and abbot (943\u2013957)==\n===Life as a monk===\n[[Image:Dunstan3.jpg|thumbnail|right|Possible self-portrait of Dunstan. Detail from the ''Glastonbury Classbook''.]]\n[[File:DunstanLarge.jpg|thumb|Fuller image]]\nDunstan worked as a [[silversmith]] and in the [[scriptorium]] while he was living at Glastonbury. It is thought likely that he was the artist who drew the well-known image of Christ with a small kneeling monk beside him in the ''Glastonbury Classbook'', \"one of the first of a series of outline drawings which were to become a special feature of Anglo-Saxon art of this period.\"{{sfn|Alexander|1992|p=9}} Dunstan became famous as a musician, illuminator, and metalworker.{{sfn|Cross|Livingstone|1997|p=514}} Lady \u00c6thelflaed, King \u00c6thelstan's niece, made Dunstan a trusted adviser and on her death she left a considerable fortune to him.{{sfn|Toke|1909}} He used this money later in life to foster and encourage a monastic revival in England. About the same time, his father Heorstan died and Dunstan inherited his fortune as well. He became a person of great influence, and on the death of King \u00c6thelstan in 940, the new King, [[Edmund I of England|Edmund]], summoned him to his court at [[Cheddar, Somerset|Cheddar]] and made him a minister.{{sfn|Bunson|Bunson|Bunson|1998|p=}}\n\nAgain, royal favour fostered jealousy among other courtiers and again Dunstan's enemies succeeded in their plots. The king was prepared to send Dunstan away.{{sfn|Toke|1909}} There were then at Cheddar certain envoys from the \"Eastern Kingdom\", which probably meant [[East Anglia]]. Dunstan implored the envoys to take him with them when they returned to their homes. They agreed to do so, but it never happened. The story is recorded:\n\n{{quote|... the king rode out to hunt the stag in [[Mendip Forest]]. He became separated from his attendants and followed a stag at great speed in the direction of the Cheddar cliffs. The stag rushed blindly over the precipice and was followed by the hounds. Eadmund endeavoured vainly to stop his horse; then, seeing death to be imminent, he remembered his harsh treatment of St Dunstan and promised to make amends if his life was spared. At that moment his horse was stopped on the very edge of the cliff. Giving thanks to God, he returned forthwith to his palace, called for St. Dunstan and bade him follow, then rode straight to Glastonbury. Entering the church, the king first knelt in prayer before the altar, then, taking St. Dunstan by the hand, he gave him the kiss of peace, led him to the [[abbot]]'s throne and, seating him thereon, promised him all assistance in restoring Divine worship and regular observance.|source={{harvnb|Toke|1909}}}}\n\n===Abbot of Glastonbury===\nDunstan, now Abbot of Glastonbury, went to work at once on the task of reform.{{sfn|Bunson|Bunson|Bunson|1998|p=}} He had to re-create monastic life and to rebuild the abbey. He began by establishing [[Benedictine]] monasticism at Glastonbury.{{sfn|Cross|Livingstone|1997|p=514}} The Rule of St. Benedict was the basis of his restoration according to the author of 'Edgar's Establishment of the Monasteries' (written in the 960s or 970s) and according to Dunstan's first biographer, who had been a member of the community at Glastonbury.{{sfn|Whitelock|1979|p=920}} Their statements are also in accordance with the nature of his first measures as abbot, with the significance of his first buildings, and with the Benedictine leanings of his most prominent disciples.{{sfn|Toke|1909}}\n\nNevertheless, not all the members of Dunstan's community at Glastonbury were monks who followed the [[Benedictine Rule]]. In fact, Dunstan's first biographer, 'B.', was a cleric who eventually joined a community of [[Canon (priest)|canons]] at [[Li\u00e8ge]] after leaving Glastonbury.{{sfn|Winterbottom|Lapidge|2011|p=lxix}}\n[[Image:Glastonburyabbey.jpg|thumb|220px|left|Remains of the [[Choir (architecture)|choir]] of Glastonbury Abbey church]]\n\nDunstan's first care was to rebuild the Church of St. Peter, rebuild the cloister, and re-establish the monastic enclosure. The secular affairs of the house were committed to his brother, Wulfric, \"so that neither himself nor any of the professed monks might break enclosure.\"{{sfn|Toke|1909}} A school for the local youth was founded and soon became the most famous of its time in England.{{sfn|Cross|Livingstone|1997|p=514}} A substantial extension of the irrigation system on the surrounding [[Somerset Levels]] was also completed.{{sfn|Williams|1970|p=50}}\n\nWithin two years of Dunstan's appointment, in 946, King Edmund was assassinated. His successor was [[Eadred of England|Eadred]]. The policy of the new government was supported by the [[Queen mother]], [[Eadgifu of Kent]], by the Archbishop of Canterbury, [[Oda the Severe|Oda]], and by the East Anglian nobles, at whose head was the powerful [[ealdorman]] [[\u00c6thelstan Half-King|\u00c6thelstan the \"Half-king\"]]. It was a policy of unification and conciliation with the Danish half of the kingdom.<ref name = \"co\"/> The goal was a firm establishment of royal authority. In ecclesiastical matters it favoured the spread of [[catholicism|Catholic]] observance, the rebuilding of churches, the moral reform of the clergy and laity, and the end of the [[Norse mythology|religion of the Danes]] in England.<ref name=\"cw\"/>\nAgainst all these reforms were the nobles of Wessex, who included most of Dunstan's own relatives, and who had an interest in maintaining established customs.{{sfn|Toke|1909}} For nine years Dunstan's influence was dominant, during which time he twice refused the office of bishop (that of Winchester in 951 and [[Bishop of Exeter|Crediton]] in 953), affirming that he would not leave the king's side so long as the king lived and needed him.{{sfn|Cross|Livingstone|1997|p=514}}\n\n===Changes in fortune===\n[[Image:Eadwig - MS Royal 14 B VI.jpg|thumb|250px|right|King Eadwig's reign was marred by conflicts with his family and with Dunstan.]]\nIn 955, Eadred died, and the situation was at once changed. [[Eadwig of England|Eadwig]], the elder son of Edmund, who then came to the throne, was a headstrong youth wholly devoted to the reactionary nobles. According to one legend, the feud with Dunstan began on the day of Eadwig's coronation, when he failed to attend a meeting of nobles. When Dunstan eventually found the young monarch, he was cavorting with a noblewoman named \u00c6lfgifu and her mother, and refused to return with the bishop. Infuriated by this, Dunstan dragged Eadwig back and forced him to renounce the girl as a \"strumpet\". Later realising that he had provoked the king, Dunstan fled to the apparent sanctuary of his cloister, but Eadwig, incited by \u00c6lfgifu, whom he married, followed him and plundered the monastery.{{sfn|Toke|1909}}\n\nAlthough Dunstan managed to escape, he saw that his life was in danger. He fled England and crossed the channel to Flanders, where he found himself ignorant of the language and of the customs of the locals.{{sfn|Cross|Livingstone|1997|p=514}} The [[Counts of Flanders|count of Flanders]], [[Arnulf I, Count of Flanders|Arnulf I]], received him with honour and lodged him in the Abbey of [[Blandijnberg|Mont Blandin]], near [[Ghent]].{{sfn|Toke|1909}} This was one of the centres of the Benedictine revival in that country, and Dunstan was able for the first time to observe the strict observance that had seen its rebirth at [[Cluny Abbey|Cluny]] at the beginning of the century. His exile was not of long duration. Before the end of 957, the [[Mercia]]ns and [[Northumbria]]ns revolted and drove out Eadwig, choosing his brother [[Edgar of England|Edgar]] as king of the country north of the Thames.<ref name = \"co\"/> The south remained faithful to Eadwig. At once Edgar's advisers recalled Dunstan.{{sfn|Cross|Livingstone|1997|p=514}}\n\n== Bishop and archbishop (957\u2013978)==\n===Bishop of Worcester and of London===\nOn Dunstan's return, Archbishop [[Oda the Severe|Oda]] consecrated him a bishop and, on the death of [[Coenwald]] of [[Anglican Diocese of Worcester|Worcester]] at the end of 957, Oda appointed Dunstan to the see.{{sfn|Fryde|Powicke|1961|p=260}}\n\nIn the following year the see of [[Diocese of London|London]] became vacant and was conferred on Dunstan, who held it simultaneously with Worcester.{{sfn|Bunson|Bunson|Bunson|1998|p=}}{{sfn|Fryde|Powicke|1961|p=260}} In October 959, Eadwig died and his brother Edgar was readily accepted as ruler of Wessex. One of Eadwig's final acts had been to appoint a successor to Archbishop Oda, who died on 2 June 958. The chosen candidate was [[\u00c6lfsige]] of Winchester, but he died of cold in the Alps as he journeyed to [[Holy See|Rome]] for the [[pallium]]. In his place Eadwig then nominated the Bishop of Wells, [[Byrhthelm (Bishop of Wells)|Byrhthelm]]. As soon as [[Edgar the Peaceful|Edgar]] became king, he reversed this second choice on the ground that Byrhthelm had not been able to govern even his first diocese properly.{{sfn|Toke|1909}} The archbishopric was then conferred on Dunstan.{{sfn|Cross|Livingstone|1997|p=514}}\n\n===Archbishop of Canterbury===\n[[Image:MS.

His steward complained, but Dunstan seems to have suggested that they trust in [[Christ|Jesus Christ]].\n\nOn his return from Rome, Dunstan at once regained his position as virtual prime minister of the kingdom. By his advice [[\u00c6lfstan (bishop of London)|\u00c6lfstan]] was appointed to the Bishopric of London, and [[Oswald of Worcester|Oswald]] to that of Worcester. In 963, [[\u00c6thelwold of Winchester|\u00c6thelwold]], the Abbot of [[Abingdon Abbey|Abingdon]], was appointed to the See of Winchester. With their aid and with the ready support of King Edgar, Dunstan pushed forward his reforms in the English Church.{{sfn|Bunson|Bunson|Bunson|1998|p=}} The monks in his communities were taught to live in a spirit of self-sacrifice, and Dunstan actively enforced the law of celibacy whenever possible.{{sfn|Hollister|1966|p=61}} He forbade the practices of [[simony]] (selling ecclesiastical offices for money) and ended the custom of [[cleric]]s appointing relatives to offices under their jurisdiction. Monasteries were built, and in some of the great cathedrals, monks took the place of the secular canons; in the rest the canons were obliged to live according to rule. The parish priests were compelled to be qualified for their office; they were urged to teach parishioners not only the truths of the Christian faith, but also trades to improve their position.<ref name=\"cw\"/> The state saw reforms as well.{{sfn|Cross|Livingstone|1997|p=514}} Good order was maintained throughout the realm and there was respect for the law. Trained bands policed the north, and a navy guarded the shores from Viking raids. There was a level of peace in the kingdom unknown in living memory.{{sfn|Toke|1909}}\n\nIn 973, Dunstan's statesmanship reached its zenith when he officiated at the coronation of King Edgar. Edgar was crowned at Bath in an imperial ceremony planned not as the initiation, but as the culmination of his reign (a move that must have taken a great deal of preliminary diplomacy).{{sfn|Churchill|1966|p=134}} This service, devised by Dunstan himself and celebrated with a poem in the ''[[Anglo-Saxon Chronicle]]'' forms the basis of the present-day [[Coronation of the British monarch|British coronation ceremony]].{{sfn|Churchill|1966|p=134}} There was a second symbolic coronation held later. This was an important step, as other kings of Britain came and gave their allegiance to Edgar at [[Chester]].{{sfn|Schama|2011|p=65}} Six kings in Britain, including the kings of Scotland and of [[Strathclyde]], pledged their faith that they would be the king's liege-men on sea and land.\n\nEdgar ruled as a strong and popular king for 16 years. In 975 he was succeeded by his eldest son [[Edward the Martyr|Edward \"the Martyr\"]].{{sfn|Cross|Livingstone|1997|p=514}} His accession was disputed by his stepmother, [[\u00c6lfthryth, Queen of England|\u00c6lfthryth]], who wished her own son [[\u00c6thelred the Unready|\u00c6thelred]] to reign. Through the influence of Dunstan, Edward was chosen and crowned at Winchester.{{sfn|Bunson|Bunson|Bunson|1998|p=}} Edgar's death had encouraged the reactionary nobles, and at once there was a determined attack upon the monks, the protagonists of reform. Throughout Mercia they were persecuted and deprived of their possessions. Their cause, however, was supported by [[\u00c6thelstan Half-King#Family|\u00c6thelwine]], the ealdorman of East Anglia, and the realm was in serious danger of civil war. Three meetings of the [[Witenagemot|Witan]] were held to settle these disputes, at [[Oxfordshire|Kyrtlington]], at [[Calne]], and at [[Amesbury]]. At the second of them the floor of the hall where the Witan was sitting gave way, and all except Dunstan, who clung to a beam, fell into the room below; several men were killed.{{sfn|Toke|1909}}\n\n==Final years (978\u201388)==\nIn March 978, King Edward was assassinated at [[Corfe Castle]], possibly at the instigation of his stepmother, and \u00c6thelred the Unready became king. His coronation on [[Low Sunday]] 31 March 978, was the last state event in which Dunstan took part.{{sfn|Toke|1909}} When the young king took the usual oath to govern well, Dunstan addressed him in solemn warning. He criticised the violent act whereby he became king and prophesied the misfortunes that were shortly to fall on the kingdom,{{sfn|Churchill|1966|p=139}} but Dunstan's influence at court was ended.{{sfn|Cross|Livingstone|1997|p=514}} Dunstan retired to Canterbury, to teach at the [[cathedral school]].{{sfn|Bunson|Bunson|Bunson|1998|p=}}\n\nOnly three more public acts are known. In 980, Dunstan joined [[\u00c6lfhere, Ealdorman of Mercia|\u00c6lfhere of Mercia]] in the solemn [[translation (relic)|translation of the relic]]s of King Edward, soon to be regarded as a saint, from their grave at [[Wareham, Dorset|Wareham]] to a shrine at [[Shaftesbury Abbey]]. In 984, in obedience to a vision of [[Saint Andrew|St Andrew]], he persuaded King \u00c6thelred to appoint [[Alphege|\u00c6lfheah]] as Bishop of Winchester in succession to \u00c6thelwold. In 986, Dunstan induced the king, by a donation of 100 pounds of silver, to stop his persecution of the See of [[Diocese of Rochester|Rochester]].{{sfn|Toke|1909}}\n\nDunstan's retirement at Canterbury consisted of long hours, both day and night, spent in private prayer, as well as his regular attendance at Mass and the [[Canonical hours|daily office]]. He visited the shrines of [[Augustine of Canterbury|St Augustine]] and [[\u00c6thelberht of Kent|St \u00c6thelberht]], and there are reports of a vision of angels who sang to him heavenly canticles.{{sfn|Toke|1909}} He worked to improve the spiritual and temporal well-being of his people, to build and restore churches, to establish schools, to judge suits, to defend widows and orphans, to promote peace, and to enforce respect for purity.<ref name=\"co\"/> He practised his crafts, made bells and organs and corrected the books in the cathedral library. He encouraged and protected European scholars who came to England, and was active as a teacher of boys in the cathedral school. On the vigil of [[Ascension of Jesus Christ|Ascension]] Day 988, it is recorded that a vision of angels warned he would die in three days.{{sfn|Toke|1909}} On the feast day itself, Dunstan said Mass and preached three times to the people: at the [[Mass (liturgy)#Liturgy of the Word|Gospel]], at the [[benediction#Christianity|benediction]], and after the [[Agnus Dei (liturgy)|Agnus Dei]]. In this last address, he announced his impending death and wished his congregation well.<ref name=\"msc\" /> That afternoon he chose the spot for his tomb, then went to his bed. His strength failed rapidly, and on Saturday morning, 19 May, he caused the clergy to assemble. Mass was celebrated in his presence, then he received [[Extreme Unction]] and the [[Viaticum]], and died. Dunstan's final words are reported to have been, \"He hath made a remembrance of his wonderful works, being a merciful and gracious Lord: He hath given food to them that fear Him.\"{{sfn|Toke|1909}}\n\nThe English people accepted him as a [[saint]] shortly thereafter. He was formally [[canonised]] in 1029. That year at the Synod of Winchester, St Dunstan's feast was ordered to be kept solemnly throughout England.{{sfn|Toke|1909}}\n\n==Legacy==\n===Shrines===\nUntil [[Thomas Becket]]'s fame overshadowed Dunstan's, he was the favourite saint of the English people. Dunstan had been buried in his [[Canterbury Cathedral#Later Saxon and Viking|cathedral]]; and when that building was destroyed by a fire in 1074, his relics were translated by Archbishop [[Lanfranc]] to a tomb on the south side of the high altar in the rebuilt [[Canterbury Cathedral]].{{sfn|Toke|1909}}\n\nPart of the decoration to the side of his tomb is still visible, and consists of some painted [[Diapering|diaperwork]], which can be viewed by visitors to the Cathedral.\n\nThe monks of Glastonbury used to claim that during the sack of Canterbury by the [[Viking|Danes]] in 1012, Dunstan's body had been carried for safety to their abbey. This story was disproved by Archbishop [[William Warham]], who opened the tomb at Canterbury in 1508. They found Dunstan's relics still to be there. Within a century, however, his shrine was destroyed during the [[English Reformation]].{{sfn|Toke|1909}}\n\n===Patronage and feast day===\nDunstan became [[patron saint]] of English [[goldsmith]]s and silversmiths because he worked as a silversmith making church plate. The [[Eastern Orthodox Church]], the [[Roman Catholic Church]], and the [[Anglican Communion]] mark his [[Calendar of saints|feast day]] on 19 May.,{{sfn|Bunson|Bunson|Bunson|1998|p=}} which is why, before the Restoration the date year on London Assay Office [[hallmark]]s ran from 19 May one year to 18 May the next, not the calendar year. This was changed at the restoration of Charles II in 1660 so that the hallmarking year began on the King's birthday, 29 May.\n\n===In literature===\n[[English literature]] contains many references to him, for example in ''[[A Christmas Carol]]'' by [[Charles Dickens]],{{efn|\"Foggier yet, and colder!

This caused the Devil great pain, and Dunstan only agreed to remove the shoe and release the Devil after he promised never to enter a place where a horseshoe is over the door. This is claimed as the origin of the lucky horseshoe.{{sfn|Lawrence|1899|p=91}}\nAt various passages in \"[[The Deptford Trilogy]]\" by the Canadian writer [[Robertson Davies]], the character [[The Deptford Trilogy#Dunstan Ramsay|Dunstan Ramsay]] is compared with the saint of the same name, and in particular some stormy events in the character's love-life are rather humorously compared to Saint Dunstan's famous struggle with Satan.\n\nA fictionalised account of his life is told in the 2017 historical novel'' Dunstan'' by [[Conn Iggulden]].{{sfn|Iggulden|2017|p=}}\n\n===An East London saint===\nDunstan's tongs are included in the [[London Borough of Tower Hamlets#Coat of arms|coat of arms of the London Borough of Tower Hamlets]], to reflect the saint's strong association with the [[East End of London]].\n\nAs Bishop of London, Dunstan was also Lord of the [[Stepney#Manor and Ancient Parish|Manor of Stepney]], and may, like subsequent bishops, have lived there. Dunstan is recorded as having founded (or rebuilt) [[St Dunstan's, Stepney|Stepney's church]], in 952 AD. This church was dedicated to All Saints, but was rededicated to Dunstan after his [[Canonization|canonisation]] in 1029.\n\nIt was initially the only church for the whole [[manor]], a manor which covered most of what would later become the East End. Population growth and other factors led to [[Stepney#Manor and Ancient Parish|Stepney parish]] being subdivided into a large number of daughter parishes.

He was successively [[Abbot of Glastonbury|Abbot of Glastonbury Abbey]], [[Bishop of Worcester]], [[Bishop of London]] and [[Archbishop of Canterbury]], later [[canonised]] as a [[saint]].{{sfn|Bunson|Bunson|Bunson|1998|p=}} His work restored monastic life in England and reformed the English Church. His 11th-century biographer [[Osbern of Canterbury|Osbern]], himself an artist and scribe, states that Dunstan was skilled in \"making a picture and forming letters\", as were other clergy of his age who reached senior rank.{{sfn|Alexander|1992|p=9}}\nDunstan served as an important minister of state to several English kings. He was the most popular saint in England for nearly two centuries, having gained fame for the many stories of his greatness, not least among which were those concerning his famed cunning in defeating the [[Devil in Christianity|devil]].{{sfn|Toke|1909}}\n\n==Early life (909\u201343)==\n\n===Birth===\nDunstan was born in [[Baltonsborough]], [[Somerset]], at the time part of the kingdom of [[Wessex]].{{sfn|Dunning|1983|p=}} He was the son of Heorstan, a noble of [[Wessex]]. Heorstan was the brother of [[Athelm]], the bishop of [[Bishop of Bath and Wells|Wells]] and [[Bishop of Winchester|Winchester]].{{sfn|Green|1895|p=121}} It is recorded that his mother, Cynethryth, was a pious woman. Osbern's ''Life of Dunstan'' relates that a messenger miraculously told her of the saintly child she would give birth to:\n\n{{quote|She was in the church of St Mary on Candleday, when all the lights were suddenly extinguished. Then the candle held by Cynethryth was as suddenly relighted, and all present lit their candles at this miraculous flame, thus foreshadowing that the boy \"would be the minister of eternal light\" to the Church of England.|source={{harvnb|Toke|1909}}}}\n\nThe anonymous author of the earliest ''Life'' places Dunstan's birth during the reign of [[Athelstan of England|Athelstan]], while Osbern fixed it at \"the first year of the reign of King \u00c6thelstan\", 924 or 925. This date, however, cannot be reconciled with other known dates of Dunstan's life and creates many obvious [[anachronism]]s. Historians therefore assume that Dunstan was born around 910 or earlier.{{sfn|Lapidge|1999|p=|loc=\"Dunstan\"}}\n\n===School to the king's court===\nAs a young boy, Dunstan studied under the [[Hiberno-Scottish mission|Irish monks]] who then occupied the ruins of [[Glastonbury Abbey]].<ref name=\"co\" /> Accounts tell of his youthful optimism and of his vision of the abbey being restored.  While still a boy, Dunstan was stricken with a near-fatal illness and effected a seemingly miraculous recovery. Even as a child, he was noted for his devotion to learning and for his mastery of many kinds of artistic craftsmanship. With his parents' consent he was [[tonsure]]d, received [[minor orders]] and served in the ancient church of St Mary. He became so well known for his devotion to learning that he is said to have been summoned by his uncle Athelm, the [[Archbishop of Canterbury]], to enter his service.{{sfn|Toke|1909}} He was later appointed to the court of King [[Athelstan]].{{sfn|Cross|Livingstone|1997|p=514}}\n[[Image:Dunstan2.jpg|thumbnail|left|Dunstan playing his harp as the Devil is paying a visit]]\n\nDunstan soon became a [[favourite]] of the king and was the envy of other members of the court.{{sfn|Toke|1909}} A plot was hatched to disgrace him and Dunstan was accused of being involved with [[witchcraft]] and [[black magic]].{{sfn|Bunson|Bunson|Bunson|1998|p=}} The king ordered him to leave the court and as Dunstan was leaving the palace his enemies physically attacked him, beat him severely, bound him, and threw him into a [[cesspit|cesspool]].<ref name=\"cw\" /> He managed to crawl out and make his way to the house of a friend. From there, he journeyed to Winchester and entered the service of his uncle, [[Alphege the Bald|\u00c6lfheah]], Bishop of Winchester.{{sfn|Toke|1909}}\n\nThe bishop tried to persuade him to become a [[monk]], but Dunstan was doubtful whether he had a vocation to a [[Clerical celibacy|celibate]] life. The answer came in the form of an attack of swelling tumours all over Dunstan's body. This ailment was so severe that it was thought to be [[leprosy]].{{sfn|Toke|1909}} It was more probably some form of [[bacteremia|blood poisoning]] caused by being beaten and thrown in the cesspool.<ref name=\"cw\"/> Whatever the cause, it changed Dunstan's mind. He took [[Holy Orders]] in 943, in the presence of \u00c6lfheah, and returned to live the life of a hermit at Glastonbury.{{sfn|Toke|1909}} Against the old church of St Mary he built a small cell five feet long and two and a half feet deep.  It was there that Dunstan studied, worked at his handicrafts, and played on his harp.{{sfn|Toke|1909}} It is at this time, according to a late 11th-century legend, that the [[Devil in Christianity|Devil]] is said to have tempted Dunstan and to have been held by the face with Dunstan's tongs.<ref name=\"cw\"/>\n\n==Monk and abbot (943\u2013957)==\n\n===Life as a monk===\n[[Image:Dunstan3.jpg|thumbnail|right|Possible self-portrait of Dunstan. Detail from the ''Glastonbury Classbook''.]]\n[[File:DunstanLarge.jpg|thumb|Fuller image]]\nDunstan worked as a [[silversmith]] and in the [[scriptorium]] while he was living at Glastonbury. It is thought likely that he was the artist who drew the well-known image of Christ with a small kneeling monk beside him in the ''Glastonbury Classbook'', \"one of the first of a series of outline drawings which were to become a special feature of Anglo-Saxon art of this period.\"{{sfn|Alexander|1992|p=9}} Dunstan became famous as a musician, illuminator, and metalworker.{{sfn|Cross|Livingstone|1997|p=514}} Lady  \u00c6thelflaed, King  \u00c6thelstan's niece, made Dunstan a trusted adviser and on her death she left a considerable fortune to him.{{sfn|Toke|1909}} He used this money later in life to foster and encourage a monastic revival in England. About the same time, his father Heorstan died and Dunstan inherited his fortune as well. He became a person of great influence, and on the death of King  \u00c6thelstan in 940, the new King, [[Edmund I of England|Edmund]], summoned him to his court at [[Cheddar, Somerset|Cheddar]] and made him a minister.{{sfn|Bunson|Bunson|Bunson|1998|p=}}\n\nAgain, royal favour fostered jealousy among other courtiers and again Dunstan's enemies succeeded in their plots. The king was prepared to send Dunstan away.{{sfn|Toke|1909}} There were then at Cheddar certain envoys from the \"Eastern Kingdom\", which probably meant [[East Anglia]]. Dunstan implored the envoys to take him with them when they returned to their homes. They agreed to do so, but it never happened. The story is recorded:\n\n{{quote|... the king rode out to hunt the stag in [[Mendip Forest]]. He became separated from his attendants and followed a stag at great speed in the direction of the Cheddar cliffs. The stag rushed blindly over the precipice and was followed by the hounds. Eadmund endeavoured vainly to stop his horse; then, seeing death to be imminent, he remembered his harsh treatment of St Dunstan and promised to make amends if his life was spared. At that moment his horse was stopped on the very edge of the cliff. Giving thanks to God, he returned forthwith to his palace, called for St. Dunstan and bade him follow, then rode straight to Glastonbury. Entering the church, the king first knelt in prayer before the altar, then, taking St. Dunstan by the hand, he gave him the kiss of peace, led him to the [[abbot]]'s throne and, seating him thereon, promised him all assistance in restoring Divine worship and regular observance.|source={{harvnb|Toke|1909}}}}\n\n===Abbot of Glastonbury===\nDunstan, now Abbot of Glastonbury, went to work at once on the task of reform.{{sfn|Bunson|Bunson|Bunson|1998|p=}} He had to re-create monastic life and to rebuild the abbey. He began by establishing [[Benedictine]] monasticism at Glastonbury.{{sfn|Cross|Livingstone|1997|p=514}} The Rule of St. Benedict was the basis of his restoration according to the author of 'Edgar's Establishment of the Monasteries' (written in the 960s or 970s) and according to Dunstan's first biographer, who had been a member of the community at Glastonbury.{{sfn|Whitelock|1979|p=920}} Their statements are also in accordance with the nature of his first measures as abbot, with the significance of his first buildings, and with the Benedictine leanings of his most prominent disciples.{{sfn|Toke|1909}}\n\nNevertheless, not all the members of Dunstan's community at Glastonbury were monks who followed the [[Benedictine Rule]].  In fact, Dunstan's first biographer, 'B.', was a cleric who eventually joined a community of [[Canon (priest)|canons]] at [[Li\u00e8ge]] after leaving Glastonbury.{{sfn|Winterbottom|Lapidge|2011|p=lxix}}\n[[Image:Glastonburyabbey.jpg|thumb|220px|left|Remains of the [[Choir (architecture)|choir]] of Glastonbury Abbey church]]\n\nDunstan's first care was to rebuild the Church of St. Peter, rebuild the cloister, and re-establish the monastic enclosure. The secular affairs of the house were committed to his brother, Wulfric, \"so that neither himself nor any of the professed monks might break enclosure.\"{{sfn|Toke|1909}} A school for the local youth was founded and soon became the most famous of its time in England.{{sfn|Cross|Livingstone|1997|p=514}} A substantial extension of the irrigation system on the surrounding [[Somerset Levels]] was also completed.{{sfn|Williams|1970|p=50}}\n\nWithin two years of Dunstan's appointment, in 946, King Edmund was assassinated. His successor was [[Eadred of England|Eadred]]. The policy of the new government was supported by the [[Queen mother]], [[Eadgifu of Kent]], by the Archbishop of Canterbury, [[Oda the Severe|Oda]], and by the East Anglian nobles, at whose head was the powerful [[ealdorman]] [[\u00c6thelstan Half-King|\u00c6thelstan the \"Half-king\"]]. It was a policy of unification and conciliation with the Danish half of the kingdom.<ref name = \"co\"/> The goal was a firm establishment of royal authority. In ecclesiastical matters it favoured the spread of [[catholicism|Catholic]] observance, the rebuilding of churches, the moral reform of the clergy and laity, and the end of the [[Norse mythology|religion of the Danes]] in England.<ref name=\"cw\"/>\nAgainst all these reforms were the nobles of Wessex, who included most of Dunstan's own relatives, and who had an interest in maintaining established customs.{{sfn|Toke|1909}} For nine years Dunstan's influence was dominant, during which time he twice refused the office of bishop (that of Winchester in 951 and [[Bishop of Exeter|Crediton]] in 953), affirming that he would not leave the king's side so long as the king lived and needed him.{{sfn|Cross|Livingstone|1997|p=514}}\n\n===Changes in fortune===\n[[Image:Eadwig - MS Royal 14 B VI.jpg|thumb|250px|right|King Eadwig's reign was marred by conflicts with his family and with Dunstan.]]\nIn 955, Eadred died, and the situation was at once changed. [[Eadwig of England|Eadwig]], the elder son of Edmund, who then came to the throne, was a headstrong youth wholly devoted to the reactionary nobles. According to one legend, the feud with Dunstan began on the day of Eadwig's coronation, when he failed to attend a meeting of nobles. When Dunstan eventually found the young monarch, he was cavorting with a noblewoman named \u00c6lfgifu and her mother, and refused to return with the bishop. Infuriated by this, Dunstan dragged Eadwig back and forced him to renounce the girl as a \"strumpet\". Later realising that he had provoked the king, Dunstan fled to the apparent sanctuary of his cloister, but Eadwig, incited by \u00c6lfgifu, whom he married, followed him and plundered the monastery.{{sfn|Toke|1909}}\n\nAlthough Dunstan managed to escape, he saw that his life was in danger. He fled England and crossed the channel to Flanders, where he found himself ignorant of the language and of the customs of the locals.{{sfn|Cross|Livingstone|1997|p=514}} The [[Counts of Flanders|count of Flanders]], [[Arnulf I, Count of Flanders|Arnulf I]], received him with honour and lodged him in the Abbey of [[Blandijnberg|Mont Blandin]], near [[Ghent]].{{sfn|Toke|1909}} This was one of the centres of the Benedictine revival in that country, and Dunstan was able for the first time to observe the strict observance that had seen its rebirth at [[Cluny Abbey|Cluny]] at the beginning of the century. His exile was not of long duration. Before the end of 957, the [[Mercia]]ns and [[Northumbria]]ns revolted and drove out Eadwig, choosing his brother [[Edgar of England|Edgar]] as king of the country north of the Thames.<ref name = \"co\"/> The south remained faithful to Eadwig. At once Edgar's advisers recalled Dunstan.{{sfn|Cross|Livingstone|1997|p=514}}\n\n== Bishop and archbishop (957\u2013978)==\n\n===Bishop of Worcester and of London===\n\nOn Dunstan's return, Archbishop [[Oda the Severe|Oda]] consecrated him a bishop and, on the death of [[Coenwald]] of [[Anglican Diocese of Worcester|Worcester]] at the end of 957, Oda appointed Dunstan to the see.{{sfn|Fryde|Powicke|1961|p=260}}\n\nIn the following year the see of [[Diocese of London|London]] became vacant and was conferred on Dunstan, who held it simultaneously with Worcester.{{sfn|Bunson|Bunson|Bunson|1998|p=}}{{sfn|Fryde|Powicke|1961|p=260}} In October 959, Eadwig died and his brother Edgar was readily accepted as ruler of Wessex. One of Eadwig's final acts had been to appoint a successor to Archbishop Oda, who died on 2 June 958. The chosen candidate was [[\u00c6lfsige]] of Winchester, but he died of cold in the Alps as he journeyed to [[Holy See|Rome]] for the [[pallium]]. In his place Eadwig then nominated the Bishop of Wells, [[Byrhthelm (Bishop of Wells)|Byrhthelm]]. As soon as [[Edgar the Peaceful|Edgar]] became king, he reversed this second choice on the ground that Byrhthelm had not been able to govern even his first diocese properly.{{sfn|Toke|1909}} The archbishopric was then conferred on Dunstan.{{sfn|Cross|Livingstone|1997|p=514}}\n\n===Archbishop of Canterbury===\n[[Image:MS. Hatton 30 Expositio Augustini in Apocalypsin 73v.jpg|thumb|right|Theological manuscript from Glastonbury Abbey ([[Bodleian Library]]):''Abbot Dunstan ordered the writing of this book''.]]\n\nDunstan went to Rome in 960, and received the pallium from [[Pope John XII]].{{sfn|Bunson|Bunson|Bunson|1998|p=}} On his journey there, Dunstan's acts of charity were so lavish as to leave nothing for himself and his attendants. His steward complained, but Dunstan seems to have suggested that they trust in [[Christ|Jesus Christ]].\n\nOn his return from Rome, Dunstan at once regained his position as virtual prime minister of the kingdom. By his advice [[\u00c6lfstan (bishop of London)|\u00c6lfstan]] was appointed to the Bishopric of London, and [[Oswald of Worcester|Oswald]] to that of Worcester. In 963, [[\u00c6thelwold of Winchester|\u00c6thelwold]], the Abbot of [[Abingdon Abbey|Abingdon]], was appointed to the See of Winchester. With their aid and with the ready support of King Edgar, Dunstan pushed forward his reforms in the English Church.{{sfn|Bunson|Bunson|Bunson|1998|p=}} The monks in his communities were taught to live in a spirit of self-sacrifice, and Dunstan actively enforced the law of celibacy whenever possible.{{sfn|Hollister|1966|p=61}} He forbade the practices of [[simony]] (selling ecclesiastical offices for money) and ended the custom of [[cleric]]s appointing relatives to offices under their jurisdiction. Monasteries were built, and in some of the great cathedrals, monks took the place of the secular canons; in the rest the canons were obliged to live according to rule. The parish priests were compelled to be qualified for their office; they were urged to teach parishioners not only the truths of the Christian faith, but also trades to improve their position.<ref name=\"cw\"/> The state saw reforms as well.{{sfn|Cross|Livingstone|1997|p=514}} Good order was maintained throughout the realm and there was respect for the law. Trained bands policed the north, and a navy guarded the shores from Viking raids. There was a level of peace in the kingdom unknown in living memory.{{sfn|Toke|1909}}\n\nIn 973, Dunstan's statesmanship reached its zenith when he officiated at the coronation of King Edgar. Edgar was crowned at Bath in an imperial ceremony planned not as the initiation, but as the culmination of his reign (a move that must have taken a great deal of preliminary diplomacy).{{sfn|Churchill|1966|p=134}} This service, devised by Dunstan himself and celebrated with a poem in the ''[[Anglo-Saxon Chronicle]]'' forms the basis of the present-day [[Coronation of the British monarch|British coronation ceremony]].{{sfn|Churchill|1966|p=134}} There was a second symbolic coronation held later. This was an important step, as other kings of Britain came and gave their allegiance to Edgar at [[Chester]].{{sfn|Schama|2011|p=65}} Six kings in Britain, including the kings of Scotland and of [[Strathclyde]], pledged their faith that they would be the king's liege-men on sea and land.\n\nEdgar ruled as a strong and popular king for 16 years. In 975 he was succeeded by his eldest son [[Edward the Martyr|Edward \"the Martyr\"]].{{sfn|Cross|Livingstone|1997|p=514}} His accession was disputed by his stepmother, [[\u00c6lfthryth, Queen of England|\u00c6lfthryth]], who wished her own son [[\u00c6thelred the Unready|\u00c6thelred]] to reign. Through the influence of Dunstan, Edward was chosen and crowned at Winchester.{{sfn|Bunson|Bunson|Bunson|1998|p=}} Edgar's death had encouraged the reactionary nobles, and at once there was a determined attack upon the monks, the protagonists of reform. Throughout Mercia they were persecuted and deprived of their possessions. Their cause, however, was supported by [[\u00c6thelstan Half-King#Family|\u00c6thelwine]], the ealdorman of East Anglia, and the realm was in serious danger of civil war. Three meetings of the [[Witenagemot|Witan]] were held to settle these disputes, at [[Oxfordshire|Kyrtlington]], at [[Calne]], and at [[Amesbury]]. At the second of them the floor of the hall where the Witan was sitting gave way, and all except Dunstan, who clung to a beam, fell into the room below; several men were killed.{{sfn|Toke|1909}}\n\n==Final years (978\u201388)==\nIn March 978, King Edward was assassinated at [[Corfe Castle]], possibly at the instigation of his stepmother, and \u00c6thelred the Unready became king. His coronation on [[Low Sunday]] 31 March 978, was the last state event in which Dunstan took part.{{sfn|Toke|1909}} When the young king took the usual oath to govern well, Dunstan addressed him in solemn warning. He criticised the violent act whereby he became king and prophesied the misfortunes that were shortly to fall on the kingdom,{{sfn|Churchill|1966|p=139}} but Dunstan's influence at court was ended.{{sfn|Cross|Livingstone|1997|p=514}} Dunstan retired to Canterbury, to teach at the [[cathedral school]].{{sfn|Bunson|Bunson|Bunson|1998|p=}}\n\nOnly three more public acts are known. In 980, Dunstan joined [[\u00c6lfhere, Ealdorman of Mercia|\u00c6lfhere of Mercia]] in the solemn [[translation (relic)|translation of the relic]]s of King Edward, soon to be regarded as a saint, from their grave at [[Wareham, Dorset|Wareham]] to a shrine at [[Shaftesbury Abbey]]. In 984, in obedience to a vision of [[Saint Andrew|St Andrew]], he persuaded King \u00c6thelred to appoint [[Alphege|\u00c6lfheah]] as Bishop of Winchester in succession to \u00c6thelwold. In 986, Dunstan induced the king, by a donation of 100 pounds of silver, to stop his persecution of the See of [[Diocese of Rochester|Rochester]].{{sfn|Toke|1909}}\n\nDunstan's retirement at Canterbury consisted of long hours, both day and night, spent in private prayer, as well as his regular attendance at Mass and the [[Canonical hours|daily office]]. He visited the shrines of [[Augustine of Canterbury|St Augustine]] and [[\u00c6thelberht of Kent|St \u00c6thelberht]], and there are reports of a vision of angels who sang to him heavenly canticles.{{sfn|Toke|1909}} He worked to improve the spiritual and temporal well-being of his people, to build and restore churches, to establish schools, to judge suits, to defend widows and orphans, to promote peace, and to enforce respect for purity.<ref name=\"co\"/> He practised his crafts, made bells and organs and corrected the books in the cathedral library. He encouraged and protected European scholars who came to England, and was active as a teacher of boys in the cathedral school. On the vigil of [[Ascension of Jesus Christ|Ascension]] Day 988, it is recorded that a vision of angels warned he would die in three days.{{sfn|Toke|1909}} On the feast day itself, Dunstan said Mass and preached three times to the people: at the [[Mass (liturgy)#Liturgy of the Word|Gospel]], at the [[benediction#Christianity|benediction]], and after the [[Agnus Dei (liturgy)|Agnus Dei]]. In this last address, he announced his impending death and wished his congregation well.<ref name=\"msc\" /> That afternoon he chose the spot for his tomb, then went to his bed. His strength failed rapidly, and on Saturday morning, 19 May, he caused the clergy to assemble. Mass was celebrated in his presence, then he received [[Extreme Unction]] and the [[Viaticum]], and died. Dunstan's final words are reported to have been, \"He hath made a remembrance of his wonderful works, being a merciful and gracious Lord: He hath given food to them that fear Him.\"{{sfn|Toke|1909}}\n\nThe English people accepted him as a [[saint]] shortly thereafter. He was formally [[canonised]] in 1029. That year at the Synod of Winchester, St Dunstan's feast was ordered to be kept solemnly throughout England.{{sfn|Toke|1909}}\n\n==Legacy==\n===Shrines===\nUntil [[Thomas Becket]]'s fame overshadowed Dunstan's, he was the favourite saint of the English people. Dunstan had been buried in his [[Canterbury Cathedral#Later Saxon and Viking|cathedral]]; and when that building was destroyed by a fire in 1074, his relics were translated by Archbishop [[Lanfranc]] to a tomb on the south side of the high altar in the rebuilt [[Canterbury Cathedral]].{{sfn|Toke|1909}}\n\nPart of the decoration to the side of his tomb is still visible, and consists of some painted [[Diapering|diaperwork]], which can be viewed by visitors to the Cathedral.\n\nThe monks of Glastonbury used to claim that during the sack of Canterbury by the [[Viking|Danes]] in 1012, Dunstan's body had been carried for safety to their abbey. This story was disproved by Archbishop [[William Warham]], who opened the tomb at Canterbury in 1508. They found Dunstan's relics still to be there. Within a century, however, his shrine was destroyed during the [[English Reformation]].{{sfn|Toke|1909}}\n\n===Patronage and feast day===\nDunstan became [[patron saint]] of English [[goldsmith]]s and silversmiths because he worked as a silversmith making church plate. The [[Eastern Orthodox Church]], the [[Roman Catholic Church]], and the [[Anglican Communion]] mark his [[Calendar of saints|feast day]] on 19 May.{{sfn|Bunson|Bunson|Bunson|1998|p=}}, which is why, before the Restoration the date year on London Assay Office [[hallmark]]s ran from 19 May one year to 18 May the next, not the calendar year. This was changed at the restoration of Charles II in 1660 so that the hallmarking year began on the King's birthday, 29 May.\n \n===In literature===\n[[English literature]] contains many references to him, for example in ''[[A Christmas Carol]]'' by [[Charles Dickens]],{{efn|\"Foggier yet, and colder! Piercing, searching, biting cold. If the good Saint Dunstan had but nipped the Evil Spirit's nose with a touch of such weather as that, instead of using his familiar weapons, then, indeed, he would have roared to lusty purpose.{{Sfn|Dickens|1893|p=24}} }} and in this folk rhyme: \n<poem>St Dunstan, as the story goes,\nOnce pull'd the devil by the nose\nWith red-hot tongs, which made him roar,\nThat he was heard three miles or more.{{sfn|Hone|1825|p=670}}</poem>\n\nThis folk story is already shown in an initial in the ''Life of Dunstan'' in the Canterbury Passionale, from the second quarter of the 12th century ([[British Library]], Harley MS 315, f. 15v.),{{sfn|Dunning|2016}} and the tongs have become a symbol of St Dunstan. \n\n[[Image:Dunstan and the Devil - Project Gutenberg eText 13978.png|thumbnail|upright|Dunstan shoeing the Devil's hoof, as illustrated by [[George Cruikshank]]]]\nDaniel Anlezark has tentatively suggested that Dunstan may be the medieval author of [[Solomon and Saturn]] citing the style, word choice, and [[Hiberno-Latin]] used in the texts.{{sfn|Anlezark|2009|p=}} However, Clive Tolley examines this claim from a linguistic point-of-view and disagrees with Anlezark's claim.{{sfn|Tolley|2010|pp=166-168}}\n\nAnother story relates how Dunstan nailed a horseshoe to the Devil's foot when he was asked to re-shoe the Devil's cloven hoof. This caused the Devil great pain, and Dunstan only agreed to remove the shoe and release the Devil after he promised never to enter a place where a horseshoe is over the door. This is claimed as the origin of the lucky horseshoe.{{sfn|Lawrence|1899|p=91}}\nAt various passages in \"[[The Deptford Trilogy]]\" by the Canadian writer [[Robertson Davies]], the character [[The Deptford Trilogy#Dunstan Ramsay|Dunstan Ramsay]] is compared with the saint of the same name, and in particular some stormy events in the character's love-life are rather humorously compared to Saint Dunstan's famous struggle with Satan.\n\nA fictionalised account of his life is told in the 2017 historical novel'' Dunstan'' by [[Conn Iggulden]].{{sfn|Iggulden|2017|p=}}\n\n===An East London saint===\nDunstan\u2019s tongs are included in the [[London Borough of Tower Hamlets#Coat of arms|coat of arms of the London Borough of Tower Hamlets]], to reflect the saint\u2019s strong association with the [[East End of London]].\n\nAs Bishop of London, Dunstan was also Lord of the [[Stepney#Manor and Ancient Parish|Manor of Stepney]], and may, like subsequent bishops, have lived there. Dunstan is recorded as having founded (or rebuilt) [[St Dunstan's, Stepney|Stepney\u2019s church]], in 952 AD. This church was dedicated to All Saints, but was rededicated to Dunstan after his [[Canonization|canonisation]] in 1029. \n\nIt was initially the only church for the whole [[Manor|manor]], a manor which covered most of what would later become the East End. Population growth and other factors led to [[Stepney#Manor and Ancient Parish|Stepney parish]] being subdivided into a large number of daughter parishes. To this day [[St Dunstan's, Stepney|St Dunstan\u2019s church]] in Stepney is known as the ''Mother Church of the East End''.\n\n===Church dedications===\nThere are churches dedicated to Dunstan all over the world. [[Church of St. Dunstan, Mayfield|St Dunstan's, Mayfield]], [[St Dunstan's, Stepney]], [[St Dunstan-in-the-East|St Dunstan-in-the-East, London]], and [[St Dunstan-in-the-West|St Dunstan-in-the-West, London]] are four of the more well known in Britain. The [[St. Dunstan's, Canterbury|church at the junction of London Road and Whitstable Road]] gives its name to the neighbourhood of Canterbury on the north bank of the [[river Stour, Kent|River Stour]].\n\n===Charity===\n[[Blind Veterans UK|St Dunstan's]]\u2014the charity that provides support, rehabilitation, and respite care to blind ex-service personnel of the [[British Armed Forces]]\u2014is named for Dunstan.\n\n==See also==\n*{{annotated link|Bishop of Worcester}}\n*[[Portal:Catholic Church/Patron Archive/May 19|Saint Dunstan, patron saint archive]]\n\n==References==\n===Notes===\n{{notelist}}\n\n===Citations===\n{{Reflist|refs=\n<ref name=\"synaxarion.gr\">{{in lang|el}} ''[http://www.synaxarion.gr/gr/sid/3266/sxsaintinfo.aspx \u1f49 \u1f0d\u03b3\u03b9\u03bf\u03c2 \u0394\u03bf\u03c5\u03bd\u03c3\u03c4\u03ac\u03bd\u03bf\u03c2 \u1f08\u03c1\u03c7\u03b9\u03b5\u03c0\u03af\u03c3\u03ba\u03bf\u03c0\u03bf\u03c2 \u039a\u03b1\u03bd\u03c4\u03bf\u03c5\u03b1\u03c1\u03af\u03b1\u03c2].'' 19 \u039c\u03b1\u0390\u03bf\u03c5. \u039c\u0395\u0393\u0391\u03a3 \u03a3\u03a5\u039d\u0391\u039e\u0391\u03a1\u0399\u03a3\u03a4\u0397\u03a3.</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"co\">{{Cite web |last= |first= |authorlink= |title=St Dunstan |work=Catholic Online |publisher=Catholic Online |url=http://www.catholic.org/saints/saint.php?saint_id=438 |format= |doi= |accessdate=5 August 2016 }}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"cw\">{{Cite web  | title =St Dunstan  | work =Catholic Community&nbsp;\u2013 Woking  | publisher =st-dunstans.org  | url =http://www.st-dunstans.org/history/biography09.htm  | accessdate =5 August 2016  | archive-url =https://web.archive.org/web/20170608074750/http://www.st-dunstans.org/history/biography09.htm  | archive-date =8 June 2017  | url-status =dead  }}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"msc\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.missionstclare.com/english/people/may19.html |title=Biography: St. Dunstan |accessdate=2 August 2007 |work=Mission St. Clare}}</ref>\n\n}}\n\n===Sources===\n{{refbegin|2|indent=yes}}\n*{{cite book|ref=harv|last=Alexander|first=Jonathan J G |title=Medieval Illuminators and Their Methods of Work|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Yy21QgAACAAJ|year=1992|publisher=Yale University Press|location=New Haven, CT|isbn=978-0-300-05689-1}}\n\n*{{cite book|ref=harv|last=Anlezark|first=Daniel |title=The Old English Dialogues of Solomon and Saturn|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3ZBjPgAACAAJ|year=2009|publisher=D.S.

I think he'd do anything. George is going to put himself in some dangerous situations when he should probably wait for back-up. But I think he loves the action and he is so passionate that he rushes in without thinking. George is very exciting as a new character. He's passionate and he loves his job. He loves being the saviour and being in the limelight. George loves the action of being a policeman, more so than the paperwork and the logistics.

George is the first officer on the scene, but the paramedics are already there. He has to try to understand what's going on very quickly. George takes control of the situation immediately. It's a really nice way to be introduced, showing him as someone who's trustworthy and who can take control of a dangerous situation. I think there'll be a lot of those, over the course of the next year.\nSo far my scenes have been with the teachers at the school. I have shared scenes with Nancy, Sally, John Paul, and then a few of the worried parents as well. I've also been with DS Cohen a few times. She's my boss and she's very good at her job, so George is keen to impress! You'll see that George is a police officer for the right reasons and his heart is in it.

I think there'll be a lot of those, over the course of the next year.\nSo far my scenes have been with the teachers at the school. I have shared scenes with Nancy, Sally, John Paul, and then a few of the worried parents as well. I've also been with DS Cohen a few times.

Its alumni include some of the wealthiest in the world, as well as top business leaders and executives.\n\nThe undergraduate acceptance rate for the Class of 2023 was 7.6%, the most selective class in the college's 119-year history. The MBA program\u2019s admission rate was 26% for the Class of 2021.\n\n==History==\nThe Stern School was founded by [[Charles Waldo Haskins]] (an alumnus of [[New York University Tandon School of Engineering]]) in 1900 as the Undergraduate School of Commerce, Accounts and Finance on the University's Washington Square campus. In 1913, Jeanette Hamill, J.D., M.A., joined the school's Economics department, becoming its first female faculty member. In 1936, women comprised 15 percent of the total enrollment.\n\n===Graduate School of Business Administration===\nThe '''Graduate School of Business Administration''' was launched in 1916, and was housed in the NYU's School of Commerce's Wall Street branch.<ref>\"In 1916, the School of Commerce's Wall Street branch became the home of New York University's Graduate School of Business Administration (GBA).\" {{cite book |title=Contemporary Challenges: American Business in a Global Economy\n|url=https://books.google.com/books?isbn=081471868X  |isbn=081471868X\n|author=Daniel E Diamond |date=1995}}</ref> Located in New York's downtown business district, the school's \"Wall Street Division\" served both full-time and currently employed students.

In the 1960s, international business courses were introduced and soon became an important focus of the school's curriculum. The New York University, Graduate School of Business Administration, C.J. Devine Institute of Finance (1959\u20131966) published many key Finance and Investment bulletins related to International finance. The school awarded its first Doctor of Commercial Sciences degree in 1970.\n<!--a series of publications followed... HIST/DIF can identify these -->\n\n===Commerce/College of Business and Public Administration===\nThe School of Commerce, Accounts and Finance was renamed the College of Business and Public Administration in 1972. In the same year, Tisch Hall, designed by [[Philip Johnson]] and [[Richard Foster (architect)|Richard Foster]] (see also: [[Bobst Library]] and Meyer Building) opened at 40 West Fourth Street to house the undergraduate college.\n\n===Stern===\nIn 1988, a $30 million gift from the school's alumnus Leonard N. Stern (B.S., 1957; M.B.A., 1959) allowed the school to consolidate its graduate and undergraduate facilities at NYU's Washington Square campus. The school was renamed Leonard N. Stern School of Business. In 1992, Stern's new $68 million state-of-the-art facility, now known as Kaufman Management Center, was inaugurated.\n\nIn 1998, a $10 million gift from [[Henry Kaufman]] (PhD 1958) supported a major expansion and upgrading of Stern's facilities. The new and renovated space is used almost exclusively to improve the quality of student life. Prominent investment banker and Home Depot investor [[Kenneth Langone]] (MBA 1960) donated $10 million to Stern in 1999. The Langone MBA for Working Professionals was renamed in his honor. Celebrating its 100th birthday in the year 2000, Stern launched a $100 million centennial campaign, the school's most ambitious fundraising effort to date. The campaign doubled the school's endowment, the number of named professorships, and the level of student financial aid.\n\n[[Peter Blair Henry]] became dean of the school in January 2010.<ref name=ft20100221>{{cite news|last=Murray|first=Sarah|title=The bigger picture|url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/2/703f0e20-1d74-11df-a893-00144feab49a.html#axzz2E8r07iXd|accessdate=December 4, 2012|newspaper=[[Financial Times]]|date=February 21, 2010}}</ref>\n\nIn 2010, the {{convert|84500|sqft|m2|adj=on}} renovation of the three Stern School of Business buildings, known as the Stern Concourse Project, was completed.<ref>{{cite web|title=Light, transparency and brand connect Stern students, faculty and New York City|url=http://www.worldarchitecturenews.com/index.php?fuseaction=wanappln.projectview&upload_id=13465|publisher=World Architecture News.com|accessdate=December 24, 2012|date=February 24, 2010}}</ref>  This project was fully funded by donors, alumni and corporate partners.<ref>{{cite web|title=Concourse Project|url=http://w4.stern.nyu.edu/concourse/index.html|publisher=New York University|accessdate=December 24, 2012}}</ref>\n\nNYU Stern Westchester offers its Langone MBA for Working Professionals in [[Purchase, New York]], at [[State University of New York at Purchase|SUNY Purchase]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.stern.nyu.edu/programs-admissions/part-time-mba-westchester/index.htm |title=NYU Stern &#124; Part-time MBA Westchester &#124; Home |publisher=Stern.nyu.edu |date= |accessdate=2014-03-05}}</ref>\n\n==Academics==\n{{Infobox business school rankings\n| QSglobal = 19\n| BI = 16\n| Economist = 19\n| FT = 19\n| BWg = 17\n| Forbes = 18\n| USNWRg = 10\n| Vault = 9\n| USNWRu = 5\n}}\n\nAs of 2009, 2,305 students are enrolled in Stern's undergraduate program and 2,969 are enrolled in its [[Master of Business Administration]] (MBA) program.

The new and renovated space is used almost exclusively to improve the quality of student life. Prominent investment banker and Home Depot investor [[Kenneth Langone]] (MBA 1960) donated $10 million to Stern in 1999. The Langone MBA for Working Professionals was renamed in his honor. Celebrating its 100th birthday in the year 2000, Stern launched a $100 million centennial campaign, the school's most ambitious fundraising effort to date.
