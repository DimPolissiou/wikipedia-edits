He described the American preference for the position and called it ''the English-American position''. Discussing [[Bronis\u0142aw Malinowski|Malinowski's]] ''The Sexual Life of Savages in North-Western Melanesia'', Kinsey wrote, \"It will be recalled that Malinowski (1929) records the nearly universal use of a totally different position among the [[Trobrianders]]&nbsp;... [and]&nbsp;... that caricatures of the English-American position are performed around&nbsp;... campfires, to the great amusement of the natives who refer to the position as the 'missionary position.'\"<ref name=\"Priest, 31\"/> To date, lexicographers and sexologists have not found use of the term ''missionary position'' before Kinsey.<ref>Priest, 30.</ref>\n\nIn 2001, Robert Priest examined the origins of the term and concluded that Kinsey had confused several factors in accidentally coining the term.<ref name=\"Priest, 31\"/> First, according to Malinowski, Trobrianders played and sang mocking songs under the full Moon, and not around a campfire. In ''Sexual Behaviors'', Kinsey wrote that the Trobrianders mocked face-to-face man-on-top woman-below intercourse, but does not give context. He mentioned that the position was learned from \"white traders, planters, or officials\", but does not discuss missionaries. Kinsey also recalled that the medieval Catholic Church taught the position, and upon seeing the natives mocking it, assumed that missionaries had taught it to them. Finally, Malinowski wrote that he saw an engaged Trobriand couple holding hands and leaning against each other, which the natives described as ''misinari si bubunela''&nbsp;\u2014 the ''missionary fashion''. Upon accidentally combining these similar facts, Kinsey invented a new phrase despite believing that he was reporting an old one.<ref name=\"Priest, 31\"/>\n\nFrom then on, the story of the name's origin may have been retold until it became largely accepted, with its connection to Kinsey and Malinowski having faded. Writers began using the expression for sexual intercourse in the late 1960s, and as [[Alex Comfort]]'s bestseller ''[[The Joy of Sex]]'' (1972) and the ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'' (1976) spread the term ''missionary position'', it gradually replaced older names.<ref>Priest, 30-31.</ref> By the 1990s, it had spread to other languages: ''Missionarsstellung'' ([[German language|German]]), ''postura del misionero'' ([[Spanish language|Spanish]]), ''missionarishouding'' ([[Dutch language|Dutch]]) and ''position du missionaire'' ([[French language|French]]).<ref name=\"Priest, 31\"/>\n\nIn [[William Shakespeare]]'s ''[[Othello]]'' (Act 1, Scene 1), the missionary position was [[euphemism|euphemistically]] called [[Beast with two backs|\"the beast with two backs\"]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.opensourceshakespeare.org/views/plays/play_view.php?WorkID=othello&Act=1&Scene=1&Scope=scene|title=Othello, Act I, Scene 1 :-: Open Source Shakespeare|website=www.opensourceshakespeare.org}}</ref>\n\n==Variations==\nThough there are a number of variations and adoptions of the missionary position, the classic missionary position involves a man and a woman, with the woman lying on her back and the man on top. Variations in the positions may vary the angle and depth of penile penetration.\n\n===Basic position===\n{{Refimprove section|date=January 2014}}\nIn the missionary position, a woman lies on her back on a bed or other surface with her legs comfortably spread with the soles of the feet resting. The penetrating partner may approach the woman on his knees between her spread legs; and either uses his arms to hold himself up, or lets his weight rest on her. When the woman's vagina is sufficiently lubricated, which may involve [[Fingering (sexual act)|fingering]] her [[vulva]] or [[clitoris]] in particular, the man will level his erect penis with her vagina for [[sexual penetration|penetration]], and may use fingers to open the woman's labia and guide the penis in.\n\nWith the penis inside the woman's vagina, the man can control the force, depth, and rhythm of [[Pelvic thrust|thrusts]], and can also control to some extent the female partner's movements. Subject to the man's weight and position, the woman may have some control by pushing her feet and legs against the mattress and by side movements in her pelvis as well as by clutching onto and moving with her partner.<ref name=\"Kar\">{{cite book |first1=Nilamadhab |last1=Kar |first2=Gopal Chandra |last2=Kar| title = Comprehensive Textbook of Sexual Medicine | publisher = [[Jaypee Brothers| Jaypee Brothers Publishers]]|pages=107\u2013108| isbn = 978-8180614057|year=2005| accessdate = February 10, 2014 | url =https://books.google.com/books?id=YxcjMPbGHQIC&pg=PA107}}</ref>  A woman can increase the force of a man's thrust by moving against the man's rhythm.\n\nThe man may straddle the woman, taking the woman's legs between his. This restricts and further controls the woman's movements, and the man can increase the tightness on the penis by pressing the woman's thighs together. However, this increases vaginal friction and makes thrusting more difficult.\n\nDuring sexual intercourse, most women experience involuntary [[vaginal contraction]]s.<ref>{{cite journal |pmid=8174183 |year=1994 |last1=Kratochv\u00edl |first1=S |title=Vaginal contractions in female orgasm |volume=90 |issue=1 |pages=28\u201333 |journal=Ceskoslovenska Psychiatrie}}</ref> The contraction causes the [[pelvic muscles]] to tighten around the penis, which increases the level of her partner's arousal and sexual frenzy and results in the man increasing the pace and force of thrusts as he approaches orgasm, which in turn further increases the woman's vaginal contraction. After a man has achieved orgasm, he will normally collapse onto the woman and will normally not be capable of further thrusting. Some men try to control their orgasm until their female partner also orgasms, but this is not always achieved. At times, a woman can achieve orgasm after the man has ceased thrusting by contracting her vaginal muscles and with pelvic movements, or the couple may change to another position that enables the woman to continue thrusting until she has reached orgasm, such as a [[woman on top]] position.\n\nDuring sexual intercourse in the missionary position, the penis is in preferential contact with the [[Anterior#Superior and inferior|anterior]] wall of the vagina and the tip of the penis reaches the [[Fornix of the vagina|anterior fornix]], while in the rear-entry position it is in preferential contact with the posterior wall of the vagina and probably reaches the posterior fornix.<ref>{{cite journal|title=Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) of Sexual Intercourse: Second Experience in Missionary Position and Initial Experience in Posterior Position |journal=Journal of Sex & Marital Therapy |volume=28 |pages=63\u201376 |year=2002 |doi=10.1080/00926230252851203 |pmid=11898711 |author1=A.

A woman can adjust the position of her legs for comfort, variety and to control the angle and depth of penetration. Generally, the higher a woman's legs, the deeper is the penetration. When the legs are raised in any way, the woman has less control of the rhythm of thrusts. Also, raising the legs raises the woman's pelvis, reduces the angle of penetration, and lowers the level of clitoral stimulation.\n\nA woman's legs can remain flat or raised toward her chest, or wrapped around the penetrating partner at various heights: at the back of the legs, at the buttocks or back or over the shoulders, in a position called the ''Wiener Auster'' or Viennese oyster.<ref>''Lexikon der Erotik'' by Lykke Aresin and Kurt Starke.

The female lies on her back and moves her legs behind her head, with the groin area being completely exposed. The male partner penetrates the vagina from the top. This is a deep penetrating position and may not be suitable for men with larger than average penis size. However, in most cases, the female will not be flexible enough to achieve this position fully, and will need to stop well before the legs are behind the head.

''The Perfumed Garden of Sensual Delight''. The Kegan Paul Arabia library, vol. 7. London: Kegan Paul, 1999.</ref> while the man penetrates her while standing. The woman can move her body freely. She can dangle her legs over the edge or raise them to any height or manner mentioned above. The woman can rest her legs on the man or he can hold them or separate them. The woman has a greater ability to move her pelvis and to arch her back, and the man can raise, support or  restrict the movement of her pelvis. The woman is not weighed down by the man's weight. This position, sometimes called the ''butterfly position'', adds variety to the angle and depth of penetration and generally enables the man to withdraw and then fully thrust the penis, with faster and more forceful thrusts. The downside of this position is that the angle of penetration results in reduced [[Sexual stimulation|clitoral stimulation]], and the woman may need direct clitoral [[Fingering (sexual act)|fingering]], either by herself or by the man, to achieve orgasm. Alternatively, the woman may either arch her back or raise her torso onto her elbows or arms to reduce the angle and enhance clitoral stimulation. Also, prior to and after the man's orgasm, the man may need to lie down on the woman.\n\n===Riding high===\n{{See also|Coital alignment technique}}\nIn the riding high missionary variant, the man enters the woman and then shifts his body up and forward toward her head. He then rocks back and forth, stimulating her clitoris with his pelvic bone, or base of his penis. This results in more consistent clitoral stimulation at the cost of a man's deep thrusting; accordingly, some men prefer to use it during only part of sex.<ref>{{cite web |last=Moore |first=Kira |url=http://www.savvymiss.com/love-advice/sex-advice/sex-sex-sex-archive/article/rethink-the-missionary-position-three-ways-to-spice-up-a-classic-4383/page-browse/1/sspn//8ac9f9dfdf.html |title=Rethink the Missionary Position: Three Ways to Spice up a Classic |publisher=Savvy Miss |accessdate=2008-02-02 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://archive.today/20071224001208/http://www.savvymiss.com/love-advice/sex-advice/sex-sex-sex-archive/article/rethink-the-missionary-position-three-ways-to-spice-up-a-classic-4383/page-browse/1/sspn//8ac9f9dfdf.html |archivedate=2007-12-24 }}</ref>\n\n===Anal sex, tribadism and other aspects===\n<!-- NOTE: This section combines these matters because, per MOS:PARAGRAPHS, \"Short paragraphs and single sentences generally do not warrant their own subheading.\"  -->\n{{multiple image\n| align = right\n| image1 = Wiki-anal missionary.png\n| width1 = 180\n| alt1 = \n| caption1 = \n| image2 = Wiki-tribadism02.png\n| width2 = 180\n| alt2 = \n| caption2 = \n| footer = Left: two men engaged in the missionary position during anal sex.

The trust is demonstrated by the woman [[Spreadeagle (position)#Sex position|spreading her legs]] in an implicit invitation for the man on top to enter the most sexually sensitive part of her body.<ref name=\"Colombia\"/> This, as well as her lack of control, the social expectation of passivity of the woman and the possibility of pregnancy, heightens her feeling of vulnerability. Her lack of control is accentuated because once the man is in place, he is very difficult to dislodge without his co-operation.

Thomas Stuttaford notes that it may be more comfortable to do so: \"The discomfort of early penetrative sex, if there is any, is usually related to tension in the pelvic or thigh muscles and/or anxiety that has prevented the usual vaginal lubrication. Muscles of the pelvic floor are more relaxed if, initially, the missionary position is chosen and a couple of pillows are arranged under the woman's bottom so her hips are tilted upwards.\"<ref name=\"Times\">Stuttaford, Thomas (October 6, 2007).

He described the American preference for the position and called it ''the English-American position''. Discussing [[Bronis\u0142aw Malinowski|Malinowski's]] ''The Sexual Life of Savages in North-Western Melanesia'', Kinsey wrote, \"It will be recalled that Malinowski (1929) records the nearly universal use of a totally different position among the [[Trobrianders]]&nbsp;... [and]&nbsp;... that caricatures of the English-American position are performed around&nbsp;... campfires, to the great amusement of the natives who refer to the position as the 'missionary position.'\"<ref name=\"Priest, 31\"/> To date, lexicographers and sexologists have not found use of the term ''missionary position'' before Kinsey.<ref>Priest, 30.</ref>\n\nIn 2001, Robert Priest examined the origins of the term and concluded that Kinsey had confused several factors in accidentally coining the term.<ref name=\"Priest, 31\"/> First, according to Malinowski, Trobrianders played and sang mocking songs under the full Moon, and not around a campfire. In ''Sexual Behaviors'', Kinsey wrote that the Trobrianders mocked face-to-face man-on-top woman-below intercourse, but does not give context. He mentioned that the position was learned from \"white traders, planters, or officials\", but does not discuss missionaries. Kinsey also recalled that the medieval Catholic Church taught the position, and upon seeing the natives mocking it, assumed that missionaries had taught it to them. Finally, Malinowski wrote that he saw an engaged Trobriand couple holding hands and leaning against each other, which the natives described as ''misinari si bubunela''&nbsp;\u2014 the ''missionary fashion''. Upon accidentally combining these similar facts, Kinsey invented a new phrase despite believing that he was reporting an old one.<ref name=\"Priest, 31\"/>\n\nFrom then on, the story of the name's origin may have been retold until it became largely accepted, with its connection to Kinsey and Malinowski having faded. Writers began using the expression for sexual intercourse in the late 1960s, and as [[Alex Comfort]]'s bestseller ''[[The Joy of Sex]]'' (1972) and the ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'' (1976) spread the term ''missionary position'', it gradually replaced older names.<ref>Priest, 30-31.</ref> By the 1990s, it had spread to other languages: ''Missionarsstellung'' ([[German language|German]]), ''postura del misionero'' ([[Spanish language|Spanish]]), ''missionarishouding'' ([[Dutch language|Dutch]]) and ''position du missionaire'' ([[French language|French]]).<ref name=\"Priest, 31\"/>\n\nIn [[William Shakespeare]]'s ''[[Othello]]'' (Act 1, Scene 1), the missionary position was [[euphemism|euphemistically]] called [[Beast with two backs|\"the beast with two backs\"]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.opensourceshakespeare.org/views/plays/play_view.php?WorkID=othello&Act=1&Scene=1&Scope=scene|title=Othello, Act I, Scene 1 :-: Open Source Shakespeare|website=www.opensourceshakespeare.org}}</ref>\n\n==Variations==\nThough there are a number of variations and adoptions of the missionary position, the classic missionary position involves a man and a woman, with the woman lying on her back and the man on top. Variations in the positions may vary the angle and depth of penile penetration.\n\n===Basic position===\n{{Refimprove section|date=January 2014}}\nIn the missionary position, a woman lies on her back on a bed or other surface with her legs comfortably spread with the soles of the feet resting. The penetrating partner may approach the woman on his knees between her spread legs; and either uses his arms to hold himself up, or lets his weight rest on her. When the woman's vagina is sufficiently lubricated, which may involve [[Fingering (sexual act)|fingering]] her [[vulva]] or [[clitoris]] in particular, the man will level his erect penis with her vagina for [[sexual penetration|penetration]], and may use fingers to open the woman's labia and guide the penis in.\n\nWith the penis inside the woman's vagina, the man can control the force, depth, pace, and rhythm of [[Pelvic thrust|thrusts]], and can also control to some extent the female partner's movements. Subject to the man's weight and position, the woman may have some control by pushing her feet and legs against the mattress and by side movements in her pelvis as well as by clutching onto and moving with her partner.<ref name=\"Kar\">{{cite book |first1=Nilamadhab |last1=Kar |first2=Gopal Chandra |last2=Kar| title = Comprehensive Textbook of Sexual Medicine | publisher = [[Jaypee Brothers| Jaypee Brothers Publishers]]|pages=107\u2013108| isbn = 978-8180614057|year=2005| accessdate = February 10, 2014 | url =https://books.google.com/books?id=YxcjMPbGHQIC&pg=PA107}}</ref>  A woman can increase the force of a man's thrust by moving against the man's rhythm.\n\nThe man may straddle the woman, taking the woman's legs between his. This restricts and further controls the woman's movements, and the man can increase the tightness on the penis by pressing the woman's thighs together. However, this increases vaginal friction and makes thrusting more difficult.\n\nDuring sexual intercourse, most women experience involuntary [[vaginal contraction]]s.<ref>{{cite journal |pmid=8174183 |year=1994 |last1=Kratochv\u00edl |first1=S |title=Vaginal contractions in female orgasm |volume=90 |issue=1 |pages=28\u201333 |journal=Ceskoslovenska Psychiatrie}}</ref> The contraction causes the [[pelvic muscles]] to tighten around the penis, which increases the level of her partner's arousal and sexual frenzy and results in the man increasing the pace and force of thrusts as he approaches orgasm, which in turn further increases the woman's vaginal contraction. After a man has achieved orgasm, he will normally collapse onto the woman and will normally not be capable of further thrusting. Some men try to control their orgasm until their female partner also orgasms, but this is not always achieved. At times, a woman can achieve orgasm after the man has ceased thrusting by contracting her vaginal muscles and with pelvic movements, or the couple may change to another position that enables the woman to continue thrusting until she has reached orgasm, such as a [[woman on top]] position.\n\nDuring sexual intercourse in the missionary position, the penis is in preferential contact with the [[Anterior#Superior and inferior|anterior]] wall of the vagina and the tip of the penis reaches the [[Fornix of the vagina|anterior fornix]], while in the rear-entry position it is in preferential contact with the posterior wall of the vagina and probably reaches the posterior fornix.<ref>{{cite journal|title=Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) of Sexual Intercourse: Second Experience in Missionary Position and Initial Experience in Posterior Position |journal=Journal of Sex & Marital Therapy |volume=28 |pages=63\u201376 |year=2002 |doi=10.1080/00926230252851203 |pmid=11898711 |author1=A.

A woman can adjust the position of her legs for comfort, variety and to control the angle and depth of penetration. Generally, the higher a woman's legs, the deeper is the penetration. When the legs are raised in any way, the woman has less control of the rhythm of thrusts. Also, raising the legs raises the woman's pelvis, reduces the angle of penetration, and lowers the level of clitoral stimulation.\n\nA woman's legs can remain flat or raised toward her chest, or wrapped around the penetrating partner at various heights: at the back of the legs, at the buttocks or back or over the shoulders, in a position called the ''Wiener Auster'' or Viennese oyster.<ref>''Lexikon der Erotik'' by Lykke Aresin and Kurt Starke.

The female lies on her back and moves her legs behind her head, with the groin area being completely exposed. The male partner penetrates the vagina from the top. This is a deep penetrating position and may not be suitable for men with larger than average penis size. However, in most cases, the female will not be flexible enough to achieve this position fully, and will need to stop well before the legs are behind the head. If that is the case, the male partner can help hold the legs in a comfortable position and continue on with intercourse.<ref>BabyMed [http://www.babymed.com/sex-positions/viennese-oyster-sex-position Viennese Oyster - Sex Position]</ref>\n\n===Butterfly position===\nThe woman can lie on her back with her hips on the edge of a platform such as a bed, table, kitchen bench, desk, etc.<ref name=\"coville\">Nafzawi, Muhammad ibn Muhammad al, and Jim Colville (trans.). ''The Perfumed Garden of Sensual Delight''. The Kegan Paul Arabia library, vol. 7. London: Kegan Paul, 1999.</ref> while the man penetrates her while standing. The woman can move her body freely. She can dangle her legs over the edge or raise them to any height or manner mentioned above. The woman can rest her legs on the man or he can hold them or separate them. The woman has a greater ability to move her pelvis and to arch her back, and the man can raise, support or  restrict the movement of her pelvis. The woman is not weighed down by the man's weight. This position, sometimes called the ''butterfly position'', adds variety to the angle and depth of penetration and generally enables the man to withdraw and then fully thrust the penis, with faster and more forceful thrusts. The downside of this position is that the angle of penetration results in reduced [[Sexual stimulation|clitoral stimulation]], and the woman may need direct clitoral [[Fingering (sexual act)|fingering]], either by herself or by the man, to achieve orgasm. Alternatively, the woman may either arch her back or raise her torso onto her elbows or arms to reduce the angle and enhance clitoral stimulation. Also, prior to and after the man's orgasm, the man may need to lie down on the woman.\n\n===Riding high===\n{{See also|Coital alignment technique}}\nIn the riding high missionary variant, the man enters the woman and then shifts his body up and forward toward her head. He then rocks back and forth, stimulating her clitoris with his pelvic bone, or base of his penis. This results in more consistent clitoral stimulation at the cost of a man's deep thrusting; accordingly, some men prefer to use it during only part of sex.<ref>{{cite web |last=Moore |first=Kira |url=http://www.savvymiss.com/love-advice/sex-advice/sex-sex-sex-archive/article/rethink-the-missionary-position-three-ways-to-spice-up-a-classic-4383/page-browse/1/sspn//8ac9f9dfdf.html |title=Rethink the Missionary Position: Three Ways to Spice up a Classic |publisher=Savvy Miss |accessdate=2008-02-02 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://archive.today/20071224001208/http://www.savvymiss.com/love-advice/sex-advice/sex-sex-sex-archive/article/rethink-the-missionary-position-three-ways-to-spice-up-a-classic-4383/page-browse/1/sspn//8ac9f9dfdf.html |archivedate=2007-12-24 }}</ref>\n\n===Anal sex, tribadism and other aspects===\n<!-- NOTE: This section combines these matters because, per MOS:PARAGRAPHS, \"Short paragraphs and single sentences generally do not warrant their own subheading.\"  -->\n{{multiple image\n| align = right\n| image1 = Wiki-anal missionary.png\n| width1 = 180\n| alt1 = \n| caption1 = \n| image2 = Wiki-tribadism02.png\n| width2 = 180\n| alt2 = \n| caption2 = \n| footer = Left: two men engaged in the missionary position during anal sex.

The trust is demonstrated by the woman [[Spreadeagle (position)#Sex position|spreading her legs]] in an implicit invitation for the man on top to enter the most sexually sensitive part of her body.<ref name=\"Colombia\"/> This, as well as her lack of control, the social expectation of passivity of the woman and the possibility of pregnancy, heightens her feeling of vulnerability. Her lack of control is accentuated because once the man is in place, he is very difficult to dislodge without his co-operation.

Thomas Stuttaford notes that it may be more comfortable to do so: \"The discomfort of early penetrative sex, if there is any, is usually related to tension in the pelvic or thigh muscles and/or anxiety that has prevented the usual vaginal lubrication. Muscles of the pelvic floor are more relaxed if, initially, the missionary position is chosen and a couple of pillows are arranged under the woman's bottom so her hips are tilted upwards.\"<ref name=\"Times\">Stuttaford, Thomas (October 6, 2007).

It was released by [[Columbia Records]] on August 31, 1993, in North America. The album comprises [[ballad]]s primarily co-written by Carey and [[Walter Afanasieff]], with whom she had previously worked on ''[[Emotions (Mariah Carey album)|Emotions]]'' (1991), and a few urban dance tracks. During the course of the album's development, Carey wanted to broaden her audience, choosing a more pop/R&B oriented sound. During this time frame, she experimented with different musical instruments, leading the album's sound away from her more contemporary previous two efforts. Two unused tracks from the album sessions were released as [[A-side and B-side|B-sides]]: \"Do You Think of Me\" and \"Everything Fades Away\".\n\nIn order to successfully take the album in a new direction, Carey and Afanasieff sought out new and innovative producers, as well as some from Carey's previous releases. [[Babyface (musician)|Kenneth \"Babyface\" Edmonds]] first began working with Carey on ''Music Box'', where he helped produce some of the album's softer and more melodious tracks, as well as being part of the songwriting process. Additional writers and producers were [[Robert Clivill\u00e9s]] and [[David Cole (producer)|David Cole]] (a pair also known as [[C+C Music Factory]]) and [[Daryl Simmons]]. While the album featured a range of music producers, the bulk of the songwriting was done by Carey and her writing partner, Walter Afanasieff. In future projects, they would continue writing material for Carey's albums, until her 1999 release ''[[Rainbow (Mariah Carey album)|Rainbow]]'', where he is absent from the writing credits.\n\nFour singles were released from the album. The first three, \"[[Dreamlover (song)|Dreamlover]]\", \"[[Hero (Mariah Carey song)|Hero]]\" and \"[[Without You (Badfinger song)#Mariah Carey version|Without You]]\", became worldwide chart-topping singles, the latter becoming Carey's highest charting international single of her career. \"Without You\" became Carey's first number-one single in most European markets and reached the top three in the United States. To promote ''Music Box'', Carey embarked on the short but successful [[Music Box Tour]] which traveled to select cities in North America. Carey was nominated for [[Grammy Award for Best Female Pop Vocal Performance|Best Female Pop Vocal Performance]] for \"Dreamlover\" at the [[36th Grammy Awards|1994 Grammy Awards]] and received the same nomination for \"[[Hero (Mariah Carey song)|Hero]]\" at the [[37th Grammy Awards|1995 Grammy Awards]].\n\nAfter its release, ''Music Box'' received generally mixed reviews from music critics. The album faced criticism regarding Carey's more mellow and lazy tone in comparison to her previous work. Commercially, the album reached number one in Australia, Austria, Belgium, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Ireland, the Netherlands, Portugal, Scotland, Switzerland, the United Kingdom, and the United States. The [[Recording Industry Association of America]] (RIAA) certified it [[RIAA certification|Diamond]], for shipments of ten million copies across the United States. ''Music Box'' remains Carey's highest seller with 28 million copies sold worldwide and is one of the [[List of best-selling albums|best-selling albums]] of all time.\n\n==Background and development==\n{{Quote box|width=25%|align=right|style=padding:8px|quote=\"Mariah and Dave did this loop thing, and it was new to us pop producers at the time.

Another writer\u2013producer that worked on the album was [[Dave Hall (record producer)|David Hall]], who with Carey wrote the U.S. single \"Dreamlover\".<ref name=\"nickson7\"/>\n\nDuring the album's recording, Carey worked with several different musicians and producers, aside from [[Walter Afanasieff]], the only hold over from her debut.<ref name=\"nickson3\">{{harvnb|Nickson|1998|p=55}}</ref> On the album's first track \"[[Dreamlover (song)|Dreamlover]]\", Carey worked with [[Dave Hall (record producer)|Dave Hall]] throughout the song's entire production.<ref name=\"nickson7\">{{harvnb|Nickson|1998|pp=100\u2013102}}</ref><ref name=\"nickson6\">{{harvnb|Nickson|1998|p=86}}</ref> In order to help with some of the song's arrangements, Mottola enrolled the help of [[Walter Afanasieff]], who took on the completed track and transformed it into a more commercial hit.<ref name=\"nickson7\"/>\n\n==Music and lyrics==\n''Emotions'' contains influences from mostly 1950s, 1960s and 1970s balladry and [[Gospel music|gospel]], as well as her continued work of R&B and soul. The album, while praised by some as more mature and raw, failed to reach the critical or commercial heights of her debut effort, while selling far less and failed to introduce Carey into a different market.<ref name=\"nickson4\">{{harvnb|Nickson|1998|p=57}}</ref> Following these events, Columbia decided to try to market Carey in a similar fashion to her debut, only having her produce a more commercial and radio-friendly album. Their plans were to tone down Carey's vocals, and soften the album's production, leaving a more contemporary pop/R&B record.<ref name=\"nickson5\">{{harvnb|Nickson|1998|p=80}}</ref> Agreeing to the change, Carey and Afanasieff began writing and recording material for her third studio effort, ''Music Box''.\n\nOne of the noticeable differences from ''Music Box'' and Carey's previous albums is its sound. The album was described by Afanasieff as a softer and more pop-oriented album, \"filling the songs with air\", and allowing far more space in the overall sound.<ref name=\"nickson7\"/> Another noticeable change is in the album's production.<ref name=\"nickson7\"/> When ''Mariah Carey'' was released, critics took notice of its \"overly produced\" and \"studio perfect\" quality, where in comparison, ''Emotions'' maintains a \"raw, live sound.\"<ref name=\"nickson7\"/> ''Music Box'' however, falls in between the two, a decision made by Carey during the album's production.<ref name=\"nickson7\"/> She would layer each track with live backing vocals, so not to sound too overly produced, but still kept the inclusion of musical synthesizers.<ref name=\"nickson7\"/>\n\nAccording to Marc Shapiro, ''Music Box'' reflects signs of Carey's vocal maturity, as well as representing an album she was truly proud of.<ref name=\"shapiro2\">{{harvnb|Shapiro|2001|pp=76\u201378}}</ref> The album's first single \"[[Dreamlover (song)|Dreamlover]]\" was described as a \"slight piece of pop fluff,\" representing a more commercial side to Carey than the \"more ambitious,\" \"[[Vision of Love]]\". Critics believed the song's chart performance was due to its summer release, as people were still looking for a \"not-too-heavy\" and more diverse sound.<ref name=\"shapiro2\"/> The song's composition was described as \"mid [[tempo]] and mildly dance-able,\" with Carey's voice being called \"perpetually happy,\" like a \"little-girl voice.\"<ref name=\"nickson7\"/>\n\n==Songs==\n{{Quote box|width=294px|align=left|quote=\"It's not that I'm experimenting with lower notes.

Approximately two-thirds of the venue's capacity was filled, which worried Carey's management.

It was released by [[Columbia Records]] on August 31, 1993, in North America. The album comprises [[ballad]]s primarily co-written by Carey and [[Walter Afanasieff]], with whom she had previously worked on ''[[Emotions (Mariah Carey album)|Emotions]]'' (1991), and a few urban dance tracks. During the course of the album's development, Carey wanted to broaden her audience, choosing a more pop/R&B oriented sound. During this time frame, she experimented with different musical instruments, leading the album's sound away from her more contemporary previous two efforts. Two unused tracks from the album sessions were released as [[A-side and B-side|B-sides]]: \"Do You Think of Me\" and \"Everything Fades Away\".\n\nIn order to successfully take the album in a new direction, Carey and Afanasieff sought out new and innovative producers, as well as some from Carey's previous releases. [[Babyface (musician)|Kenneth \"Babyface\" Edmonds]] first began working with Carey on ''Music Box'', where he helped produce some of the album's softer and more melodious tracks, as well as being part of the songwriting process. Additional writers and producers were [[Robert Clivill\u00e9s]] and [[David Cole (producer)|David Cole]] (a pair also known as [[C+C Music Factory]]) and [[Daryl Simmons]]. While the album featured a range of music producers, the bulk of the songwriting was done by Carey and her writing partner, Walter Afanasieff. In future projects, they would continue writing material for Carey's albums, until her 1999 release ''[[Rainbow (Mariah Carey album)|Rainbow]]'', where he is absent from the writing credits.\n\nFour singles were released from the album. The first three, \"[[Dreamlover (song)|Dreamlover]]\", \"[[Hero (Mariah Carey song)|Hero]]\" and \"[[Without You (Badfinger song)#Mariah Carey version|Without You]]\", became worldwide chart-topping singles, the latter becoming Carey's highest charting international single of her career. \"Without You\" became Carey's first number-one single in most European markets and reached the top three in the United States. To promote ''Music Box'', Carey embarked on the short but successful [[Music Box Tour]] which traveled to select cities in North America. Carey was nominated for [[Grammy Award for Best Female Pop Vocal Performance|Best Female Pop Vocal Performance]] for \"Dreamlover\" at the [[36th Grammy Awards|1994 Grammy Awards]] and received the same nomination for \"[[Hero (Mariah Carey song)|Hero]]\" at the [[37th Grammy Awards|1995 Grammy Awards]].\n\nAfter its release, ''Music Box'' received generally mixed reviews from music critics. The album faced criticism regarding Carey's more mellow and lazy tone in comparison to her previous work. Commercially, the album reached number one in Australia, Austria, Belgium, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Ireland, the Netherlands, Portugal, Scotland, Switzerland, the United Kingdom, and the United States. The [[Recording Industry Association of America]] (RIAA) certified it [[RIAA certification|Diamond]], for shipments of ten million copies across the United States. ''Music Box'' remains Carey's highest seller with 28 million copies sold worldwide and is one of the [[List of best-selling albums|best-selling albums]] of all time.\n\n==Background and development==\n{{Quote box|width=25%|align=right|style=padding:8px|quote=\"Mariah and Dave did this loop thing, and it was new to us pop producers at the time.

Carey's [[Mariah Carey (album)|self-titled]] debut [[studio album]], released the following year, focused on re-recording and mastering several songs she had already written in high school alongside classmate, [[Ben Margulies]].<ref name=\"nickson\">{{harvnb|Nickson|1998|p=50}}</ref> Aside from the seven songs taken from Carey's demo tape, four other tracks were written and produced by the former and an array of famed record producers. The album was complimented by critics, who called it a mature debut, full of various genre influences ranging from [[Pop music|pop]], [[Contemporary R&B|R&B]] and [[Soul music|soul]].<ref name=\"nickson2\">{{harvnb|Nickson|1998|p=53}}</ref> The album became a commercial success, selling fifteen million units globally.<ref name=\"bet\">{{cite web|url=http://www.bet.com/entertainment/News/mariahtwenty.htm?wbc_purpose=Basic&WBCMODE=PresentationUnpublished&Referrer=%7B1165D08F-7604-4004-92E0-04CCBC1FAAF0%7D|title=BET Exclusive: Mariah Celebrates 20 Years; Thanks Fans|work=[[Black Entertainment Television]]|publisher=[[Viacom (2005\u2013present)|Viacom]]|accessdate=August 15, 2010}}</ref> While making a strong impact on pop music, Carey became interested in altering her sound, and deviating from pop music for her second studio effort, ''[[Emotions (Mariah Carey album)|Emotions]]'' (1991).<ref name=\"nickson2\"/> Following the success of her debut, Columbia allowed her to take more control over her musical departure, enabling her to change her genre infusions, melodies and production.\n\nWith Carey in the captain's chair, having more control than she had on any other album, she took the album in a new direction, alongside Afanasieff.<ref name=\"nickson7\"/> For Carey's third studio effort, she enrolled the help of a range of songwriters, as well as record producers.<ref name=\"nickson7\"/> Aside from Afanasieff, [[Babyface (musician)|Kenneth \"Babyface\" Edmonds]], a man who would collaborate with Carey often in the near future, also took part in the project.<ref name=\"nickson7\"/> Babyface, who helped produce much of the album, also co-wrote a track with Carey titled \"[[Never Forget You (Mariah Carey song)|Never Forget You]]\", a song that was released as a B-side to \"Without You\" exclusively in the United States.<ref name=\"nickson7\"/> The album, which consisted mostly of slower ballads (with the exception of \"Dreamlover\", \"Now That I Know\", and \"I've Been Thinking about You\"), contained collaborations with some carry-on producers and writers from ''[[Emotions (Mariah Carey album)|Emotions]]''.<ref name=\"nickson7\"/> Of these were [[C+C Music Factory|Clivill\u00e9s & Cole]] (of C+C Music Factory), who co-wrote the track \"Now That I Know\", a danceable pop ballad, which used similar formulas and synthesizers from tracks on ''Emotions''. Another writer\u2013producer that worked on the album was [[Dave Hall (record producer)|David Hall]], who with Carey wrote the U.S. single \"Dreamlover\".<ref name=\"nickson7\"/>\n\nDuring the album's recording, Carey worked with several different musicians and producers, aside from [[Walter Afanasieff]], the only hold over from her debut.<ref name=\"nickson3\">{{harvnb|Nickson|1998|p=55}}</ref> On the album's first track \"[[Dreamlover (song)|Dreamlover]]\", Carey worked with [[Dave Hall (record producer)|Dave Hall]] throughout the song's entire production.<ref name=\"nickson7\">{{harvnb|Nickson|1998|pp=100\u2013102}}</ref><ref name=\"nickson6\">{{harvnb|Nickson|1998|p=86}}</ref> In order to help with some of the song's arrangements, Mottola enrolled the help of [[Walter Afanasieff]], who took on the completed track and transformed it into a more commercial hit.<ref name=\"nickson7\"/>\n\n==Music and lyrics==\n''Emotions'' contains influences from mostly 1950s, 1960s and 1970s balladry and [[Gospel music|gospel]], as well as her continued work of R&B and soul. The album, while praised by some as more mature and raw, failed to reach the critical or commercial heights of her debut effort, while selling far less and failed to introduce Carey into a different market.<ref name=\"nickson4\">{{harvnb|Nickson|1998|p=57}}</ref> Following these events, Columbia decided to try to market Carey in a similar fashion to her debut, only having her produce a more commercial and radio-friendly album. Their plans were to tone down Carey's vocals, and soften the album's production, leaving a more contemporary pop/R&B record.<ref name=\"nickson5\">{{harvnb|Nickson|1998|p=80}}</ref> Agreeing to the change, Carey and Afanasieff began writing and recording material for her third studio effort, ''Music Box''.\n\nOne of the noticeable differences from ''Music Box'' and Carey's previous albums is its sound. The album was described by Afanasieff as a softer and more pop-oriented album, \"filling the songs with air\", and allowing far more space in the overall sound.<ref name=\"nickson7\"/> Another noticeable change is in the album's production.<ref name=\"nickson7\"/> When ''Mariah Carey'' was released, critics took notice of its \"overly produced\" and \"studio perfect\" quality, where in comparison, ''Emotions'' maintains a \"raw, live sound.\"<ref name=\"nickson7\"/> ''Music Box'' however, falls in between the two, a decision made by Carey during the album's production.<ref name=\"nickson7\"/> She would layer each track with live backing vocals, so not to sound too overly produced, but still kept the inclusion of musical synthesizers.<ref name=\"nickson7\"/>\n\nAccording to Marc Shapiro, ''Music Box'' reflects signs of Carey's vocal maturity, as well as representing an album she was truly proud of.<ref name=\"shapiro2\">{{harvnb|Shapiro|2001|pp=76\u201378}}</ref> The album's first single \"[[Dreamlover (song)|Dreamlover]]\" was described as a \"slight piece of pop fluff,\" representing a more commercial side to Carey than the \"more ambitious,\" \"[[Vision of Love]]\". Critics believed the song's chart performance was due to its summer release, as people were still looking for a \"not-too-heavy\" and more diverse sound.<ref name=\"shapiro2\"/> The song's composition was described as \"mid [[tempo]] and mildly dance-able,\" with Carey's voice being called \"perpetually happy,\" like a \"little-girl voice.\"<ref name=\"nickson7\"/>\n\n==Songs==\n{{Quote box|width=294px|align=left|quote=\"It's not that I'm experimenting with lower notes.

Approximately two-thirds of the venue's capacity was filled, which worried Carey's management.

In late 1993, Carey appeared on ''[[The Arsenio Hall Show]]'', performing both \"[[Dreamlover (song)|Dreamlover]]\" and \"[[Hero (Mariah Carey song)|Hero]].\" Other 1993 performances included \"Hero\" on ''[[The Jay Leno Show]]'' and \"Dreamlover\" on her fourth visit to ''[[Top of the Pops]]''. Carey continued promoting the album in 1994, performing \"[[Without You (Badfinger song)#Mariah Carey version|Without You]]\" on a fifth visit to ''Top of the Pops'', as well as visiting France, Germany, Japan, Spain and Sweden.
