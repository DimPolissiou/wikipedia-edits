Tiger is forced to kill one of his own men who has defected to [[Pakistan]]'s spy agency [[Inter-Services Intelligence]] (ISI). He subsequently kills many ISI agents in his escape from Iraq.\nTiger returns to [[India]] and reports to his boss, Shenoy ([[Girish Karnad]]), in [[New Delhi]]. He is immediately sent on a mission to [[Dublin]] to observe a scientist of Indian origin, Professor Anwar Jamaal Kidwai ([[Roshan Seth]]), who teaches at [[Trinity College, Dublin|Trinity College]] and is suspected of sharing his findings with the Pakistani defence establishment. Fellow RAW agent Gopi ([[Ranvir Shorey]]) accompanies Tiger on this mission. Tiger meets the scientist but fails to spend enough time for his observance and instead begins to spend time with the scientist's caretaker Zoya ([[Katrina Kaif]]), who is studying at a local dance academy. He tries to befriend Zoya to extract information, but begins to discover his human side as he grows closer to her. Tiger is attacked and robbed at his residence by a person suspected to be an ISI agent. Gopi repeatedly warns Tiger not to fall in love with Zoya, but his love cannot be stopped. Tiger asks Zoya for a date and there they both came to know about their feelings for each other. Before telling her his feelings, during a visit to dance academy, Tiger discovers that Zoya is an ISI agent and refuses to commit treason on Pakistan when he asks. Instead of killing Zoya, Tiger lets her go.\n\nSome time later, Tiger and Zoya meet again at a [[United Nations|UN]] Foreign Minister's Meeting in [[Istanbul]] when Zoya signals to him using a cryptic message. They decide to leave everything for their love and fool their respective agencies by taking a flight to [[Cuba]], having told their agencies that they are in [[Kazakhstan]]. Some years later, their agencies trace Zoya and Tiger due to a CCTV recording. They track them down in Havana, [[Cuba]], and the ISI agents catch Zoya. Tiger meets Gopi, who is searching for him for RAW, and having lied to Gopi that both Tiger and Zoya intend to return to India and cooperate with RAW, convinces Gopi to save Zoya from the ISI agents.  Instead of returning to India, the pair trick Gopi and escape aboarding an aeroplane. Tiger calls Shenoy, who tells him that RAW will find both spies. Tiger tells Shenoy that they will only return when Pakistan and India no longer need ISI and RAW. In the epilogue, several images of Tiger and Zoya in cities including [[Venice]], [[Cape Town]], [[Zurich]] and [[London]] are shown, where sightings of them have been reported. But neither agencies could catch them.\n\n===''Tiger Zinda Hai'' (2017)=== \n{{Main| Tiger Zinda Hai}}\nA sequel titled ''Tiger Zinda Hai'' was announced on 13 September 2016. Salman Khan and Katrina Kaif reprise their roles from the first film. In this film, Tiger is presumed to be dead by both the agencies, but it turns out that he is alive and fighting by himself against a global terror organization.<ref name=\"DNA India\"/> This sequel is based on the [[Foreign hostages in Iraq#India|2014 abduction of Indian nurses]] by [[ISIL]].<ref name=\"rediff\"/> Indian agent Tiger and Pakistani agent Zoya join forces in the name of humanity, against the militant messiah Abu Usman. Tiger Zinda Hai is an espionage action drama that follows a daring rescue mission in Iraq.\n\n===Unititled Third \"''Tiger''\" film (2021)===\nA third film and the last film of the franchise is currently under development and [[Ali Abbas Zafar]] will return as the director and will start scripting the film after the release his another film ''[[Bharat (film) | Bharat]]'' with [[Salman Khan]] which is an official adaption of the 2014 South Korean film ''[[Ode to My Father]]''.\n\n==Cast and characters==\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Character\n! colspan=\"3\" | Film\n|-\n! style=\"width:20%;\"| ''[[Ek Tha Tiger]]'' <br>(2012)\n! style=\"width:20%;\"| ''[[Tiger Zinda Hai]]'' <br>(2017)\n! style=\"width:20%;\"| ''Unititled Third \"Tiger\" film'' <br>(2021)\n|-\n!

Tiger is forced to kill one of his own men who has defected to [[Pakistan]]'s spy agency [[Inter-Services Intelligence]] (ISI). He subsequently kills many ISI agents in his escape from Iraq.\nTiger returns to [[India]] and reports to his boss, Shenoy ([[Girish Karnad]]), in [[New Delhi]]. He is immediately sent on a mission to [[Dublin]] to observe a scientist of Indian origin, Professor Anwar Jamaal Kidwai ([[Roshan Seth]]), who teaches at [[Trinity College, Dublin|Trinity College]] and is suspected of sharing his findings with the Pakistani defence establishment. Fellow RAW agent Gopi ([[Ranvir Shorey]]) accompanies Tiger on this mission. Tiger meets the scientist but fails to spend enough time for his observance and instead begins to spend time with the scientist's caretaker Zoya ([[Katrina Kaif]]), who is studying at a local dance academy. He tries to befriend Zoya to extract information, but begins to discover his human side as he grows closer to her. Tiger is attacked and robbed at his residence by a person suspected to be an ISI agent. Gopi repeatedly warns Tiger not to fall in love with Zoya, but his love cannot be stopped. Tiger asks Zoya for a date and there they both came to know about their feelings for each other. Before telling her his feelings, during a visit to dance academy, Tiger discovers that Zoya is an ISI agent and refuses to commit treason on Pakistan when he asks. Instead of killing Zoya, Tiger lets her go.\n\nSome time later, Tiger and Zoya meet again at a [[United Nations|UN]] Foreign Minister's Meeting in [[Istanbul]] when Zoya signals to him using a cryptic message. They decide to leave everything for their love and fool their respective agencies by taking a flight to [[Cuba]], having told their agencies that they are in [[Kazakhstan]]. Some years later, their agencies trace Zoya and Tiger due to a CCTV recording. They track them down in Havana, [[Cuba]], and the ISI agents catch Zoya. Tiger meets Gopi, who is searching for him for RAW, and having lied to Gopi that both Tiger and Zoya intend to return to India and cooperate with RAW, convinces Gopi to save Zoya from the ISI agents.  Instead of returning to India, the pair trick Gopi and escape aboarding an aeroplane. Tiger calls Shenoy, who tells him that RAW will find both spies. Tiger tells Shenoy that they will only return when Pakistan and India no longer need ISI and RAW. In the epilogue, several images of Tiger and Zoya in cities including [[Venice]], [[Cape Town]], [[Zurich]] and [[London]] are shown, where sightings of them have been reported. But neither agencies could catch them.\n\n===''Tiger Zinda Hai'' (2017)=== \n{{Main| Tiger Zinda Hai}}\nA sequel titled ''Tiger Zinda Hai'' was announced on 13 September 2016. Salman Khan and Katrina Kaif reprise their roles from the first film.
