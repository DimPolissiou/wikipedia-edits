{"title_page": "Landscaping", "text_new": "[[File:Courtyard creation Kuching, Malaysia.jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|Landscaping an elementary school courtyard in the city of [[Kuching]]]]\n'''Landscaping''' refers to any activity that modifies the visible features of an area of land, including:\n\n# living [[organism|elements]], such as [[flora]] or [[fauna]]; or what is commonly called [[gardening]], the art and craft of growing plants with a goal of creating a beauty within the [[landscape]].\n# natural elements such as [[landform]]s, [[terrain]] shape and elevation, or [[water body|bodies of water]]; and\n# abstract elements such as the [[weather]] and lighting conditions.\nLandscaping requires expertise in [[horticulture]] and artistic design.\n\n== Understanding the land ==\nSo to understand landscaping you first have to understand Lawn. Now a Lawn is grass and grass is green and green is a color and a color is on a spectrum of colors and a spectrum of colors is the light spectrum and the light spectrum is a Lawn. Now scaping is when you need to trim your lawn. Now back to the origins of Lawn in 13 BC the first lawn was invented in Mississippi along with mormons. This allowed EASTER eggs to be put out for all the good boys and girls on december 25th and then in the year 9000 we had a lawnmower that cut lawn.\n\n\nConstruction requires study and observation. It is not the same in different parts of the world. Landscaping varies according to different [[region]]s.<ref name=\"google1\">{{cite book|last1=Diekelmann|first1=John|last2=Schuster|first2=Robert M.|title=Natural Landscaping: Designing with Native Plant Communities|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fmajmru4g98C|year=2002|publisher=University of Wisconsin Press|isbn=978-0-299-17324-1}}</ref> Therefore, normally local natural experts are recommended if it is done for the first time.

Three years later, in 1979, SAP launched [[SAP R/2]], expanding the capabilities of the system to other areas, such as material management and [[production planning]]. In 1981, SAP brought a re-designed product to market. However, SAP R/2 did not improve until the period between 1985 and 1990. SAP released the new [[SAP R/3]] in 1992. SAP developed and released several versions of R/3 through 1995. By the mid-1990s, SAP followed the trend from [[Mainframe computer|mainframe]] computing to [[client-server architecture|client/server architectures]]. The development of SAP's internet strategy with mySAP.com redesigned the concept of business processes (integration via Internet).<ref name=\"saphistory\" /> As a result, R/3 was replaced with the introduction of SAP ERP Central Component (ECC) 5.0 in 2004.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.cipherbsc.com/sap-ecc-modules/|title=SAP ECC Modules - Cipher Business Solutions|last=Solutions|first=Cipher Business|publisher=Cipher Business Solutions|access-date=2017-03-29|language=en-US}}</ref> Architectural changes were also made to support an enterprise service architecture to transition customers to a services-oriented architecture.
