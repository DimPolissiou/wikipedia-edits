Born in [[McComb, Mississippi]] and raised in [[Kentwood, Louisiana]], she appeared in stage productions and television series, before signing with [[Jive Records]] in 1997. Spears's first two studio albums, ''[[...Baby One More Time (album)|...Baby One More Time]]'' (1999) and ''[[Oops!... I Did It Again (album)|Oops!... I Did It Again]]'' (2000), were global successes and made her the best-selling teenage artist of all-time. Referred to as the \"[[Honorific nicknames in popular music|Princess of Pop]]\", Spears is regarded as a [[pop icon]] and is credited with influencing the revival of [[teen pop]] during the late 1990s and early 2000s.\n\nSpears adopted more mature and provocative themes for her next two studio albums, ''[[Britney (album)|Britney]]'' (2001) and ''[[In the Zone]]'' (2003), and made her feature film debut in a starring role in ''[[Crossroads (2002 film)|Crossroads]]'' (2002). Following a series of heavily publicized personal struggles and erratic public behavior beginning in 2006, Spears's career was interrupted, before the release of her fifth studio album ''[[Blackout (Britney Spears album)|Blackout]]'' (2007), which is often critically referred to as her best work.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-news/britney-spears-blackout-a-salute-to-her-misunderstood-punk-masterpiece-121525/|title=Britney Spears' 'Blackout': A Salute to Her Misunderstood Punk Masterpiece|last=|first=|date=|website=Rolling Stone|access-date=June 9, 2019}}</ref> Spears' personal struggles led her to be placed on a still ongoing [[conservatorship]]. She returned to the top of record charts with her sixth and seventh studio albums, ''[[Circus (Britney Spears album)|Circus]]'' (2008) and ''[[Femme Fatale (Britney Spears album)|Femme Fatale]]'' (2011), respectively. In 2012, ''[[Forbes]]'' reported that Spears was the highest paid female musician of the year, with earnings of $58&nbsp;million, having last topped the list in 2002.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ibtimes.com/britney-spears-highest-paid-woman-music-2012-full-list-935061 |title=Britney Spears Is The Highest-Paid Woman in Music For 2012; Full List |work=International Business Times |accessdate=January 4, 2013}}</ref> During the promotion of her eighth and ninth studio albums, ''[[Britney Jean]]'' (2013) and ''[[Glory (Britney Spears album)|Glory]]'' (2016), Spears embarked on a four-year [[concert residency]], [[Britney: Piece of Me]], at [[Planet Hollywood Resort & Casino]] in Las Vegas, which became one of the highest-grossing residencies of all-time. In 2019, Spears announced an indefinite career hiatus and was later admitted involuntarily into a mental health facility by her [[Conservatorship|conservator]], leading to a court-led investigation into malpractice conducted by Spears's team.\n\nSpears has scored six number one albums on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]], making her the third best performing female artist on the chart.<ref name=\"billboard_472190\">{{cite web|url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/472190/britney-spears-snares-sixth-no-1-on-billboard-200-with-femme-fatale |title=Britney Spears Snares Sixth No. 1 on Billboard 200 with 'Femme Fatale' |work=Billboard |date=September 14, 2009 |accessdate=April 24, 2011}}</ref> Five of Spears's singles have reached number one on the US [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]]: \"[[...Baby One More Time (song)|...Baby One More Time]]\", \"[[Womanizer (song)|Womanizer]]\", \"[[3 (Britney Spears song)|3]]\", \"[[Hold It Against Me]]\", and \"[[S&M (song)|S&M]]\".

Born in [[McComb, Mississippi]] and raised in [[Kentwood, Louisiana]], she appeared in stage productions and television series, before signing with [[Jive Records]] in 1997. Spears's first two studio albums, ''[[...Baby One More Time (album)|...Baby One More Time]]'' (1999) and ''[[Oops!... I Did It Again (album)|Oops!... I Did It Again]]'' (2000), were global successes and made her the best-selling teenage artist of all-time. Referred to as the \"[[Honorific nicknames in popular music|Princess of Pop]]\", Spears is regarded as a [[pop icon]] and is credited with influencing the revival of [[teen pop]] during the late 1990s and early 2000s.\n\nSpears adopted more mature and provocative themes for her next two studio albums, ''[[Britney (album)|Britney]]'' (2001) and ''[[In the Zone]]'' (2003), and made her feature film debut in a starring role in ''[[Crossroads (2002 film)|Crossroads]]'' (2002). Following a series of heavily publicized personal struggles and erratic public behavior beginning in 2006, Spears's career was interrupted, before the release of her fifth studio album ''[[Blackout (Britney Spears album)|Blackout]]'' (2007), which is often critically referred to as her best work.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-news/britney-spears-blackout-a-salute-to-her-misunderstood-punk-masterpiece-121525/|title=Britney Spears' 'Blackout': A Salute to Her Misunderstood Punk Masterpiece|last=|first=|date=|website=Rolling Stone|access-date=June 9, 2019}}</ref> Spears' personal struggles led her to be placed on a still ongoing [[conservatorship]]. She returned to the top of record charts with her sixth and seventh studio albums, ''[[Circus (Britney Spears album)|Circus]]'' (2008) and ''[[Femme Fatale (Britney Spears album)|Femme Fatale]]'' (2011), respectively. In 2012, ''[[Forbes]]'' reported that Spears was the highest paid female musician of the year, with earnings of $58&nbsp;million, having last topped the list in 2002.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ibtimes.com/britney-spears-highest-paid-woman-music-2012-full-list-935061 |title=Britney Spears Is The Highest-Paid Woman in Music For 2012; Full List |work=International Business Times |accessdate=January 4, 2013}}</ref> During the promotion of her eighth and ninth studio albums, ''[[Britney Jean]]'' (2013) and ''[[Glory (Britney Spears album)|Glory]]'' (2016), Spears embarked on a four-year [[concert residency]], [[Britney: Piece of Me]], at [[Planet Hollywood Resort & Casino]] in Las Vegas, which became one of the highest-grossing residencies of all-time. In 2019, Spears announced an indefinite career hiatus and was later admitted involuntarily into a mental health facility by her [[Conservatorship|conservator]], leading to a court-led investigation into malpractice conducted by Spears's team.\n\nSpears has scored six number one albums on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]], making her the third best performing female artist on the chart.<ref name=\"billboard_472190\">{{cite web|url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/472190/britney-spears-snares-sixth-no-1-on-billboard-200-with-femme-fatale |title=Britney Spears Snares Sixth No. 1 on Billboard 200 with 'Femme Fatale' |work=Billboard |date=September 14, 2009 |accessdate=April 24, 2011}}</ref> Five of Spears's singles have reached number one on the US [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]]: \"[[...Baby One More Time (song)|...Baby One More Time]]\", \"[[Womanizer (song)|Womanizer]]\", \"[[3 (Britney Spears song)|3]]\", \"[[Hold It Against Me]]\", and \"[[S&M (song)|S&M]]\". Other singles, \"[[Oops!... I Did It Again (song)|Oops!... I Did It Again]]\" and \"[[Toxic (song)|Toxic]]\", topped the charts in most countries. With \"3\" in 2009 and \"Hold It Against Me\" in 2011, she became the second artist after [[Mariah Carey]] in the Hot 100's history to debut at number one with two or more songs.

Casting director Matt Casella rejected her as too young, but introduced her to Nancy Carson, a New York City talent agent. Carson was impressed with Spears's singing and suggested enrolling her at the [[Professional Performing Arts School]]; shortly after, Lynne and her daughters moved to a sublet apartment in New York.\n\nSpears was hired for her first professional role as the understudy for the lead role of Tina Denmark in the Off-Broadway musical ''[[Ruthless!]]''. She also appeared as a contestant on the popular television show ''[[Star Search]]'' and was cast in a number of commercials.<ref>{{harvnb|Spears|Craker|2008|p=75}}</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Laufenberg|2005|p=616}}</ref> In December 1992, she was cast in ''The Mickey Mouse Club'' alongside [[Christina Aguilera]], [[Justin Timberlake]], [[Ryan Gosling]], and [[Keri Russell]].

Although she made friends with most of her classmates, she compared the school to \"the opening scene in ''[[Clueless (film)|Clueless]]'' with all the [[cliques]]. [...] I was so bored.

Lynne asked family friend and entertainment lawyer [[Larry Rudolph]] for his opinion and submitted a tape of Spears singing over a [[Whitney Houston]] karaoke song along with some pictures. Rudolph decided that he wanted to pitch her to record labels, for which she needed a professional demo made.

{"title_page": "Craniofacial cleft", "text_new": "A '''facial cleft''' is an opening or gap in the [[face]], or a malformation of a part of the face. Facial clefts is a collective term for all sorts of clefts. All structures like bone, soft tissue, skin etc. can be affected. Facial clefts are extremely rare [[congenital anomalies]]. There are many variations of a type of clefting and classifications are needed to describe and classify all types of clefting. Facial clefts hardly ever occur isolated; most of the time there is an overlap of adjacent facial clefts.<ref>{{cite journal |pmid=10332258 |year=1996 |last1=Moore |first1=MH |title=Rare craniofacial clefts |volume=7 |issue=6 |pages=408\u201311 |journal=The Journal of Craniofacial Surgery |doi=10.1097/00001665-199611000-00003}}</ref>\n\n{{TOC limit|limit=3}}\n\n== Classifications ==\nThere are different classifications about facial clefts.

Left: boney clefts, Right: Soft tissue clefts.]]\nIn 1976 [[Paul Tessier]] published a classification on facial clefts based on the anatomical position of the clefts. The different types of Tessier clefts are numbered 0 to 14. These 15 different types of clefts can be put into 4 groups, based on their position:<ref>Fearon, JA et al. \"Rare Craniofacial Clefts: A surgical Classification\", J Craniofac Surg. 2008 Jan;19(1):110-2,{{ cite journal |doi=10.1097/SCS.0b013e31815ca1ba| pmid=18216674 |year=2008 |last1=Fearon |first1=JA |title=Rare craniofacial clefts: a surgical classification |volume=19 |issue=1 |pages=110\u20132 |journal=The Journal of Craniofacial Surgery }}</ref> midline clefts, paramedian clefts, orbital clefts and lateral clefts. The Tessier classification describes the clefts at soft tissue level as well as at bone level, because it appears that the soft tissue clefts can have a slightly different location on the face than the bony clefts.\n\n==== Midline clefts ====\nThe midline clefts are Tessier number 0 (\"median craniofacial dysplasia\"), number 14 ([[frontonasal dysplasia]]), and number 30 (\"lower midline facial cleft\", also known as \"median mandibular cleft\"). These clefts bisect the face vertically through the midline. Tessier number 0 bisects the [[maxilla]] and the nose, Tessier number 14 comes between the nose and the [[frontal bone]]. The Tessier number 30 facial cleft is through the tongue, lower lip and [[mandible]]. The tongue may be absent, hypoplastic, bifid, or even duplicated.<ref name=Bhattacharyya2012>{{cite journal|last=Bhattacharyya|first=NC|last2=Kalita|first2=K|last3=Gogoi|first3=M|last4=Deuri|first4=PK|title=Tessier 30 facial cleft|journal=Journal of Indian Association of Pediatric Surgeons|volume=17|issue=2|pages=75\u20137|year=2012|doi=10.4103/0971-9261.93970|pmc=3326828|pmid=22529554}}</ref> People with this condition may be [[Ankyloglossia|tongue-tied]].<ref name=Bhattacharyya2012/>\n\n==== Paramedian clefts ====\nTessier number 1, 2, 12 and 13 are the paramedian clefts. These clefts are quite similar to the midline clefts, but they are further away from the midline of the face. Tessier number 1 and 2 both come through the maxilla and the nose, in which Tessier number 2 is further from the midline ([[Lateral (anatomy)|lateral]]) than number 1. Tessier number 12 is in extent of number 2, positioned between nose and frontal bone, while Tessier number 13 is in extent of number 1, also running between nose and forehead. Both 12 and 13 run between the midline and the orbit.\n\n==== Orbital clefts ====\nTessier number 3, 4, 5, 9, 10 and 11 are orbital clefts. These clefts all have the involvement of the [[Orbit (anatomy)|orbit]]. Tessier number 3, 4, and 5 are positioned through the maxilla and the orbital floor. Tessier number 9, 10 and 11 are positioned between the upper side of the orbit and the forehead or between the upper side of the orbit and the [[temple]] of the head. \nLike the other clefts, Tessier number 11 is in extent to number 3, number 10 is in extent to number 4 and number 9 is in extent to number 5.\n\n==== Lateral clefts ====\nThe lateral clefts are the clefts which are positioned horizontally on the face. These are Tessier number 6, 7 and 8. Tessier number 6 runs from the orbit to the cheek bone. Tessier number 7 is positioned on the line between the corner of the mouth and the ear. A possible lateral cleft comes from the corner of the mouth towards the ear, which gives the impression that the mouth is bigger. It\u2019s also possible that the cleft begins at the ear and runs towards the mouth. Tessier number 8 runs from the outer corner of the eye towards the ear. \nThe combination of a Tessier number 6-7-8 is seen in the [[Treacher Collins syndrome]]. Tessier number 7 is more related to [[hemifacial microsomia]] and number 8 is more related to [[Goldenhar syndrome]].\n\n=== Van der Meulen classification ===\nVan der Meulen classification divides different types of clefts based on where the development arrest occurs in the [[embryogenesis]]. A primary cleft can occur in an early stage of the development of the face (17&nbsp;mm length of the embryo). The developments arrests can be divided in four different location groups: internasal, [[human nose|nasal]], nasalmaxillar and maxillar. The maxillar location can be subdivided in [[median]] and lateral clefts.\n \n<center>\n<gallery>\nFile: Van_der_meulen_-_internasal_dysplasia.jpg | Internasal dysplasia\nFile: Nasal_dysplasia.jpg | Nasal dysplasia\nFile: Nasalmaxillary_dysplasia.jpg | Nasomaxillary dysplasia\nFile: Maxillary_dysplasia.jpg | Maxillary dysplasia\n</gallery>\n</center>\n\n==== Internasal dysplasia ====\nInternasal [[dysplasia]] is caused by a development arrest before the union of the both nasal halves. These clefts are characterized by a median cleft lip, a median notch of the [[cupid's bow]] or a duplication of the labial [[frenulum]]. Besides the median cleft lip, [[hypertelorism]] can be seen in these clefts. Also sometimes there can be an underdevelopment of the [[premaxilla]].\n\n==== Nasal dysplasia ====\nNasal dysplasia or nasoschisis is caused by a development arrest of the lateral side of the nose, resulting in a cleft in one of the nasal halves. The nasal septum and cavity can be involved, though this is rare. Nasoschisis is also characterized by hypertelorism.\n\n==== Nasomaxillary dysplasia ====\nNasomaxillary dysplasia is caused by a development arrest at the junction of the lateral side of the nose and the maxilla, which results in a complete or non-complete cleft between the nose and the orbital floor (nasoocular cleft) or between the mouth, nose and the orbital floor (oronasal-ocular cleft). The development of the lip is normal.\n\n==== Maxillary dysplasia ====\nMaxillary dysplasia can manifest itself on two different locations in the maxilla: in the medial or the lateral part of the maxilla.\n* '''''Median maxillary dysplasia''''' is caused by a development failure of the medial part of the maxillary [[ossification center]]s. This results in secondary clefting of the lip, [[philtrum]] and palate. Clefting from the maxilla to the orbital floor has also been reported.\n* '''''Lateral maxillary dysplasia''''' is caused by a development failure of the lateral part of the maxillary ossification centers, which also results in secondary clefting of the lip and palate. Clefting of the lateral part of the lower eyelid is typical for lateral maxillary dysplasia.\n==Causes==\nIt is possible that facial clefts are caused by a disorder in the migration of [[neural crest cell]]s.<ref name=\":0\">{{cite journal |doi=10.1097/01.PRS.0000070971.95846.9C |pmid =12900623 |title=Common Craniofacial Anomalies: Facial Clefts and Encephaloceles |year=2003 |last1=Hunt |first1=Jeremy A. |last2=Hobar |first2=P.

(2013). Genetics of Cleft Lip and Cleft Palate. Am J Med Genet C Semin Med Genet 163, 246\u2013258.</ref>. There are multiple genetic and environmental factors which contribute to craniofacial development. Within craniofacial disorders and [[Craniofacial abnormality|abnormalities]], orofacial clefts, and specifically [[Cleft lip and cleft palate|cleft lip]] (CL) and [[Cleft lip and cleft palate|cleft palate]] (CP) are the most common in humans<ref name=\":1\" />. Occurrences of CL/P are most often (around seventy percent of cases) isolated and nonsyndromic, meaning they are not associated with a syndrome or inherited genetic conditions<ref name=\":1\" /><ref name=\":2\">Yoon, A.J., Pham, B.N., and Dipple, K.M. (2016). Genetic Screening in Patients with Craniofacial Malformations. J Pediatr Genet 5, 220\u2013224.</ref>. Around thirty percent occur with other structural variances, and over 500 syndromes have been identified in which clefting is a principal feature<ref name=\":1\" /><ref name=\":2\" />. Clefting can result from [[Teratology|teratogens]], an agent that disrupts embryo development such as, radiation, maternal infection, chemicals, or drugs<ref name=\":1\" /><ref name=\":2\" />. [[Chromosome abnormality|Chromosomal abnormalities]] or [[Mutation|mutations]] at single gene loci have also contributed to clefting development<ref name=\":1\" /><ref name=\":2\" />. Genetic causes are linked with most craniofacial syndromes, and CL/P and other orofacial clefts are recognized as [[Heterogeneous condition|heterogeneous disorders]], meaning there are multiple recognized causes<ref name=\":1\" /><ref name=\":3\">Cohen, M.M. (2002). Malformations of the craniofacial region: evolutionary, embryonic, genetic, and clinical perspectives. Am. J. Med. Genet. 115, 245\u2013268.</ref>. Orofacial clefts have great phenotypic diversity, and their associated genetic environments have called for vast research and investigation.\n\n==== Environmental Interaction ====\nCraniofacial disorders have high variance in phenotypic expression, and researchers have suggested this variance could be due to interactions between the mutated/deviated genes and other genes, along with interactions with environmental factors<ref name=\":4\">Weinberg, Seth M., Robert Cornell, and Elizabeth J. Leslie. 2018. \u201cCraniofacial Genetics: Where Have We Been and Where Are We Going?\u201d PLoS Genetics 14 (6): e1007438. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pgen.1007438.</ref><ref name=\":5\">Roosenboom, Jasmien, Greet Hens, Brooke C.

Environmental causes have been found to contribute to craniofacial clefting, however, these are still influenced by and supported by genetic factors. Many studies, for example, have linked maternal smoking to increased CLP risk; however, the increased risk suggests that genes in metabolic pathways could still contribute to susceptibility or formation of CL/P<ref name=\":6\">Dixon, M.J., Marazita, M.L., Beaty, T.H., and Murray, J.C. (2011). Cleft lip and palate: synthesizing genetic and environmental influences. Nat Rev Genet 12, 167\u2013178.</ref>.\n\n==== Development and Inheritance ====\nThe craniofacial complex begins its progress in the fourth week of development, and results from [[neural crest]] cells migrating to form and fuse the facial primordia<ref name=\":1\" /><ref name=\":2\" />. Failures or deviations in this process result in craniofacial clefts, either CL or CP<ref name=\":0\" />. The range of variation in phenotype aligns with ancestry<ref name=\":1\" /><ref name=\":6\" />. Studies have found increased amounts of clefting in the relatives of patients with clefts, suggesting genetic factors are the underlying cause for CL/P<ref name=\":1\" />. Inheritance has a known and significant role in human craniofacial morphology. This is supported through cephalometric and anthropometric comparisons of family members including between triplets, twins, siblings, and parents and children<ref>The Role of Genetics in Craniofacial Morphology and Growth | Annual Review of Anthropology.</ref>.\n\n==== Genetic Experimentation ====\nGenetic factors of craniofacial clefting can be investigated and tracked through several methods including [[sequencing]] in humans, [[Genome-wide association study|Genome-wide association studies]] (GWAs), [[fate mapping]], expression analysis, and animal studies (knockout experiments or models with clefting from chemical mutagenesis)<ref>Facebase.org</ref>. [[Twin study|Twin studies]] and familial clustering have also revealed that facial structure and formation are genetically linked. Several genes have been associated with craniofacial disorders through experimentation, including sequencing Mendelian clefting syndromes<ref name=\":1\" />. Over 25 loci have been identified as potential influencers of craniofacial clefts across populations<ref name=\":4\" />.\n\n==== Linked Genes ====\nThe [[transforming growth factor]] (''TGF'') family has provided multiple candidate genes linked with craniofacial development and malformation<ref name=\":7\">Genetic and Teratogenic Approaches To Craniofacial Development - D.L. Young, R.A. Schneider, D. Hu, J.A. Helms, 2000.</ref><ref name=\":8\">Wilkie, A.O., and Morriss-Kay, G.M. (2001). Genetics of craniofacial development and malformation. Nat. Rev. Genet. 2, 458\u2013468.</ref><ref name=\":6\" /><ref name=\":2\" />. ''TGF'' is involved in cell migration, differentiation, and proliferation, as well as regulating the extracellular matrix<ref name=\":7\" />. Another gene that has been flagged as causal for craniofacial disorders, including CL/P, is [[IRF6|interferon regulatory factor 6]] or, ''[[IRF6]]''<ref name=\":1\" /><ref name=\":6\" /><ref name=\":9\">SPECC1L deficiency results in increased adherens junction stability and reduced cranial neural crest cell delamination. - PubMed - NCBI.</ref>. Mutations in ''IRF6'' cause [[Van der Woude syndrome]], the most common clefting syndrome<ref name=\":1\" />. [[VAX1|Ventral anterior homeobox 1]], ''VAX1,'' and [[Noggin (protein)|noggin]], ''NOG'', were identified with genome-wide significance for contributing to CL/P<ref name=\":6\" />. Additionally, mutations in ''SPECC1L'' have recently been identified as influential to facial structure formation, and as causal for syndromic facial clefting<ref name=\":9\" /><ref>Kruszka, P., Li, D., Harr, M.H., Wilson, N.R., Swarr, D., McCormick, E.M., Chiavacci, R.M., Li, M., Martinez, A.F., Hart, R.A., et al.

Genet. 52, 104\u2013110.</ref>. Nonsyndromic CL/P has been associated with the transcription factor [[FOXE1|forkhead box protein E1]] (''FOXE1''), as mutations have resulted in cases of CL/P in mice<ref name=\":2\" />. Other genes which have been found to interact with or contribute to craniofacial clefting include ''FGFR''s, ''TWIST'', ''MSX''s, ''GREM1'', ''TCOF1'', ''PAX''s, ''MAFB'', ''ABCA4,'' and ''WNT'' allowing great cause for more research into the genetic basis for craniofacial disorders<ref name=\":3\" /><ref name=\":8\" /><ref name=\":4\" /><ref name=\":5\" /><ref name=\":6\" />.\n\n== Prevention ==\nBecause the cause of facial clefts still is unclear, it is difficult to say what may prevent children being born with facial clefts. It seems that [[folic acid]] contributes to lowering the risk of a child being born with a facial cleft.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1136/bmj.39079.618287.0B |pmid=17259187 |title=Folic acid supplements and risk of facial clefts: national population based case-control study |year=2007 |last1=Wilcox |first1=A.

Which kind of surgery is used depends on the type of clefting and which structures are involved. There is much discussion about the timing of reconstruction of bone and soft tissue. The problem with early reconstruction is the recurrence of the deformity due to the intrinsic restricted growth. This requires additional operations at a later age to make sure all parts of the face are in proportion.<ref>{{cite journal|doi=10.3109/02844318209006569 |pmid= 7051271|title=Adolescent Facial Morphology of Early Bone-Grafted Cleft Lip and Palate Patients|year=1982|last1=Friede|first1=Hans|last2=Johanson|first2=Bengt|journal=Scandinavian Journal of Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery and Hand Surgery|volume=16|pages=41\u201353|issue=1}}</ref> A disadvantage of early bone reconstruction is the chance to damage the tooth germs, which are located in the maxilla, just under the orbit. The soft tissue reconstruction can be done at an early age, but only if the used skin flap can be used again during a second operation. The timing of the operation depends on the urgency of the underlying condition. If the operation is necessary to function properly, it should be done at early age. The best aesthetic result is achieved when the incisions are positioned in areas which attract the least attention (they cover up the scars). If, however, the function of a part of the face isn\u2019t damaged, the operation depends on psychological factors and the facial area of reconstruction. \n \nThe treatment plan of a facial cleft is planned right after diagnosis. This plan includes every operation needed in the first 18 years of the patients life to reconstruct the face fully. \nIn this plan, a difference is made between problems that need to be solved to improve the health of the patient (coloboma) and problems that need to be solved for a better cosmetic result (hypertelorism). \n \nThe treatment of the facial clefts can be divided in different areas of the face: the cranial anomalies, the orbital and eye anomalies, the nose anomalies, the midface anomalies and the mouth anomalies.\n\n=== Treatment of the cranial anomalies ===\nThe most common cranial anomaly seen in combination with facial clefts is [[encephalocele]].\n\n==== Encephalocele ====\nThe treatment of encephalocele is based on surgery to repair the bony gap and provide adequate protection of the underlying brain. The question remains if the external brain tissue should be put back into the skull or if it is possible to cut off that piece of brain tissue, because its claimed that the external piece of brain tissue often isn\u2019t functional,<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1288/00005537-198208000-00008 |pmid= 7098736 |year=1982 |last1=Kamerer |first1=Donald B. |title= Temporal Bone Encephalocele ???

This should be closed as soon as possible, to prevent drought of the eye and a consecutive loss of vision.<ref>Patipa M et al., \"Surgical management of congenital eyelid coloboma\", Ophthalmic Surg. 1982 Mar;13(3):212-216 {{cite journal |pmid=7088491 |year=1982 |last1=Patipa |first1=M |last2=Wilkins |first2=RB |last3=Guelzow |first3=KW |title=Surgical management of congenital eyelid coloboma |volume=13 |issue=3 |pages=212\u20136 |journal=Ophthalmic Surgery }}</ref>\n\n==== Vertical orbital dystopia ====\nVertical orbital dystopia can occur in facial clefts when the orbital floor and/or the maxilla is involved in the cleft. Vertical orbital dystopia means that the eyes do not lay on the same horizontal line in the face (one eye is positioned lower than the other). The treatment is based on the reconstruction of this orbital floor, by either closing the boney cleft or reconstructing the orbital floor using a [[bone graft]].<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1097/SCS.0b013e3181e57241 |pmid=20613583 |title=Orbital Floor Reconstruction |year=2010 |last1=Tabrizi |first1=Reza |last2=Ozkan |first2=Taha Birkan |last3=Mohammadinejad |first3=Cyrus |last4=Minaee |first4=Nasim |journal=Journal of Craniofacial Surgery |volume=21 |issue=4 |pages=1142\u20131146 }}</ref>\n\n==== Hypertelorism ====\nThere are many types of operations which can be performed to treat a hypertelorism. 2 options are: box osteotomy and facial bipartition<ref>Marchad D & Arnaud E, \"Midface surgery from Tessier to distraction\", Childs Nerv Syst. 1999 Nov;15(11-12):681-94, {{ cite journal |doi=10.1007/s003810050458 |pmid= 10603010 |title=Midface surgery from Tessier to distraction |year=1999 |last1=Marchac |first1=D. |last2=Arnaud |first2=Eric |journal=Child's Nervous System |volume=15 |issue=11\u201312 |pages=681\u2013694}}</ref> (also referred to as a median fasciotomy).\nThe goal of the box osteotomy is to bring the orbits closer together by removing a part of the bone between the orbits, to detach both orbits from the surrounding bone structures and move both orbits more to the centre of the face. \nThe goal of the facial bipartition is not only to bring the orbits closer together, but also to create more space in the maxilla. This can be done by splitting the maxilla and the frontal bone, remove a triangular shaped piece of bone from the forehead and nasal bones and pulling the two pieces of forehead together. Not only will the hypertelorism be solved by pulling the frontal bone closer together, but because of this pulling, the space between the both parts of the maxilla will become wider.\n<center>\n<gallery>\nFile: Picture_box_osteotomy.jpg|<center> Box Osteotomy </center>\nFile: Picture_median_fasciotomy.jpg | <center> Facial Bipartition </center>\n</gallery>\n</center>\n\n=== Treatment of nose anomalies ===\nThe nose anomalies found in facial clefts vary. The main goal of the treatment is to reconstruct the nose to get a functional and esthetic acceptable result. A few possible treatment options are to reconstruct the nose with a forehead flap or reconstruct the nasal dorsum with a bone graft, for example a rib graft. The [[nasal reconstruction]] with a forehead flap is based on the repositioning of a skin flap from the forehead to the nose. A possible downside of this reconstruction is that once you performed it at a younger age, you can\u2019t lengthen the flap at a later stage. A second operation is often needed if the operation is done on early age, because the nose has a restricted growth in the cleft area. Repair of the [[Ala of nose|ala]] (wing of the nose) often requires the inset of cartilage graft, commonly taken from the ear.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1288/00005537-198505000-00003 |pmid=3990484 |year=1985 |last1=Tardy |first1=M.

This skinflap can be used for other operations in the further, as it can be raised again and transposed again. In the treatment of midface anomalies there are generally more operations needed. Bone tissue reconstruction of the midface often occurs later than the soft tissue reconstruction. The most common method to reconstruct the midface is by using the fracture/ incision lines described by [[Ren\u00e9 Le Fort]]. When the cleft involves the maxilla, it is likely that the impaired growth will result in a smaller maxillary bone in all 3 dimensions (height, projection, width).\n\n=== Treatment of mouth anomalies ===\nThere are several options for treatment of mouth anomalies like Tessier cleft number 2-3-7 . These clefts are also seen in various syndromes like Treacher Collins syndrome and hemifacial microsomia, which makes the treatment much more complicated. In this case, treatment of mouth anomalies is a part of the treatment of the syndrome.\n\n== See also ==\n'''Related articles'''\n\n* [[Ectrodactyly\u2013ectodermal dysplasia\u2013cleft syndrome]]\n* [[Cleft hand]]\n* [[Cleft lip and palate]]\n\n'''Syndromes'''\n\n* [[Treacher Collins syndrome]]\n* [[Hemifacial microsomia]]\n* [[Goldenhar syndrome]]\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist|2}}\n\n\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Facial Cleft}}\n[[Category:Facial features]]\n[[Category:Oral and maxillofacial surgery]]\n[[Category:Congenital disorders]]\n", "text_old": "A '''facial cleft''' is an opening or gap in the [[face]], or a malformation of a part of the face.

Left: boney clefts, Right: Soft tissue clefts.]]\nIn 1976 [[Paul Tessier]] published a classification on facial clefts based on the anatomical position of the clefts. The different types of Tessier clefts are numbered 0 to 14. These 15 different types of clefts can be put into 4 groups, based on their position:<ref>Fearon, JA et al. \"Rare Craniofacial Clefts: A surgical Classification\", J Craniofac Surg. 2008 Jan;19(1):110-2,{{ cite journal |doi=10.1097/SCS.0b013e31815ca1ba| pmid=18216674 |year=2008 |last1=Fearon |first1=JA |title=Rare craniofacial clefts: a surgical classification |volume=19 |issue=1 |pages=110\u20132 |journal=The Journal of Craniofacial Surgery }}</ref> midline clefts, paramedian clefts, orbital clefts and lateral clefts. The Tessier classification describes the clefts at soft tissue level as well as at bone level, because it appears that the soft tissue clefts can have a slightly different location on the face than the bony clefts.\n\n==== Midline clefts ====\nThe midline clefts are Tessier number 0 (\"median craniofacial dysplasia\"), number 14 ([[frontonasal dysplasia]]), and number 30 (\"lower midline facial cleft\", also known as \"median mandibular cleft\"). These clefts bisect the face vertically through the midline. Tessier number 0 bisects the [[maxilla]] and the nose, Tessier number 14 comes between the nose and the [[frontal bone]]. The Tessier number 30 facial cleft is through the tongue, lower lip and [[mandible]]. The tongue may be absent, hypoplastic, bifid, or even duplicated.<ref name=Bhattacharyya2012>{{cite journal|last=Bhattacharyya|first=NC|last2=Kalita|first2=K|last3=Gogoi|first3=M|last4=Deuri|first4=PK|title=Tessier 30 facial cleft|journal=Journal of Indian Association of Pediatric Surgeons|volume=17|issue=2|pages=75\u20137|year=2012|doi=10.4103/0971-9261.93970|pmc=3326828|pmid=22529554}}</ref> People with this condition may be [[Ankyloglossia|tongue-tied]].<ref name=Bhattacharyya2012/>\n\n==== Paramedian clefts ====\nTessier number 1, 2, 12 and 13 are the paramedian clefts. These clefts are quite similar to the midline clefts, but they are further away from the midline of the face. Tessier number 1 and 2 both come through the maxilla and the nose, in which Tessier number 2 is further from the midline ([[Lateral (anatomy)|lateral]]) than number 1. Tessier number 12 is in extent of number 2, positioned between nose and frontal bone, while Tessier number 13 is in extent of number 1, also running between nose and forehead. Both 12 and 13 run between the midline and the orbit.\n\n==== Orbital clefts ====\nTessier number 3, 4, 5, 9, 10 and 11 are orbital clefts. These clefts all have the involvement of the [[Orbit (anatomy)|orbit]]. Tessier number 3, 4, and 5 are positioned through the maxilla and the orbital floor. Tessier number 9, 10 and 11 are positioned between the upper side of the orbit and the forehead or between the upper side of the orbit and the [[temple]] of the head. \nLike the other clefts, Tessier number 11 is in extent to number 3, number 10 is in extent to number 4 and number 9 is in extent to number 5.\n\n==== Lateral clefts ====\nThe lateral clefts are the clefts which are positioned horizontally on the face. These are Tessier number 6, 7 and 8. Tessier number 6 runs from the orbit to the cheek bone. Tessier number 7 is positioned on the line between the corner of the mouth and the ear. A possible lateral cleft comes from the corner of the mouth towards the ear, which gives the impression that the mouth is bigger. It\u2019s also possible that the cleft begins at the ear and runs towards the mouth. Tessier number 8 runs from the outer corner of the eye towards the ear. \nThe combination of a Tessier number 6-7-8 is seen in the [[Treacher Collins syndrome]]. Tessier number 7 is more related to [[hemifacial microsomia]] and number 8 is more related to [[Goldenhar syndrome]].\n\n=== Van der Meulen classification ===\nVan der Meulen classification divides different types of clefts based on where the development arrest occurs in the [[embryogenesis]]. A primary cleft can occur in an early stage of the development of the face (17&nbsp;mm length of the embryo). The developments arrests can be divided in four different location groups: internasal, [[human nose|nasal]], nasalmaxillar and maxillar. The maxillar location can be subdivided in [[median]] and lateral clefts.\n \n<center>\n<gallery>\nFile: Van_der_meulen_-_internasal_dysplasia.jpg | Internasal dysplasia\nFile: Nasal_dysplasia.jpg | Nasal dysplasia\nFile: Nasalmaxillary_dysplasia.jpg | Nasomaxillary dysplasia\nFile: Maxillary_dysplasia.jpg | Maxillary dysplasia\n</gallery>\n</center>\n\n==== Internasal dysplasia ====\nInternasal [[dysplasia]] is caused by a development arrest before the union of the both nasal halves. These clefts are characterized by a median cleft lip, a median notch of the [[cupid's bow]] or a duplication of the labial [[frenulum]]. Besides the median cleft lip, [[hypertelorism]] can be seen in these clefts. Also sometimes there can be an underdevelopment of the [[premaxilla]].\n\n==== Nasal dysplasia ====\nNasal dysplasia or nasoschisis is caused by a development arrest of the lateral side of the nose, resulting in a cleft in one of the nasal halves. The nasal septum and cavity can be involved, though this is rare. Nasoschisis is also characterized by hypertelorism.\n\n==== Nasomaxillary dysplasia ====\nNasomaxillary dysplasia is caused by a development arrest at the junction of the lateral side of the nose and the maxilla, which results in a complete or non-complete cleft between the nose and the orbital floor (nasoocular cleft) or between the mouth, nose and the orbital floor (oronasal-ocular cleft). The development of the lip is normal.\n\n==== Maxillary dysplasia ====\nMaxillary dysplasia can manifest itself on two different locations in the maxilla: in the medial or the lateral part of the maxilla.\n* '''''Median maxillary dysplasia''''' is caused by a development failure of the medial part of the maxillary [[ossification center]]s. This results in secondary clefting of the lip, [[philtrum]] and palate. Clefting from the maxilla to the orbital floor has also been reported.\n* '''''Lateral maxillary dysplasia''''' is caused by a development failure of the lateral part of the maxillary ossification centers, which also results in secondary clefting of the lip and palate. Clefting of the lateral part of the lower eyelid is typical for lateral maxillary dysplasia.\n==Causes==\nIt is possible that facial clefts are caused by a disorder in the migration of [[neural crest cell]]s.<ref name=\":0\">{{cite journal |doi=10.1097/01.PRS.0000070971.95846.9C |pmid =12900623 |title=Common Craniofacial Anomalies: Facial Clefts and Encephaloceles |year=2003 |last1=Hunt |first1=Jeremy A. |last2=Hobar |first2=P.

(2013). Genetics of Cleft Lip and Cleft Palate. Am J Med Genet C Semin Med Genet 163, 246\u2013258.</ref>. There are multiple genetic and environmental factors which contribute to craniofacial development. Within craniofacial disorders and [[Craniofacial abnormality|abnormalities]], orofacial clefts, and specifically [[Cleft lip and cleft palate|cleft lip]] (CL) and [[Cleft lip and cleft palate|cleft palate]] (CP) are the most common in humans<ref name=\":1\" />. Occurrences of CL/P are most often (around seventy percent of cases) isolated and nonsyndromic, meaning they are not associated with a syndrome or inherited genetic conditions<ref name=\":1\" /><ref name=\":2\">Yoon, A.J., Pham, B.N., and Dipple, K.M. (2016). Genetic Screening in Patients with Craniofacial Malformations. J Pediatr Genet 5, 220\u2013224.</ref>. Around thirty percent occur with other structural variances, and over 500 syndromes have been identified in which clefting is a principal feature<ref name=\":1\" /><ref name=\":2\" />. Clefting can result from [[Teratology|teratogens]], an agent that disrupts embryo development such as, radiation, maternal infection, chemicals, or drugs<ref name=\":1\" /><ref name=\":2\" />. [[Chromosome abnormality|Chromosomal abnormalities]] or [[Mutation|mutations]] at single gene loci have also contributed to clefting development<ref name=\":1\" /><ref name=\":2\" />. Genetic causes are linked with most craniofacial syndromes, and CL/P and other orofacial clefts are recognized as [[Heterogeneous condition|heterogeneous disorders]], meaning there are multiple recognized causes<ref name=\":1\" /><ref name=\":3\">Cohen, M.M. (2002). Malformations of the craniofacial region: evolutionary, embryonic, genetic, and clinical perspectives. Am. J. Med. Genet. 115, 245\u2013268.</ref>. Orofacial clefts have great phenotypic diversity, and their associated genetic environments have called for vast research and investigation.\n\n==== Environmental Interaction ====\nCraniofacial disorders have high variance in phenotypic expression, and researchers have suggested this variance could be due to interactions between the mutated/deviated genes and other genes, along with interactions with environmental factors<ref name=\":4\">Weinberg, Seth M., Robert Cornell, and Elizabeth J. Leslie. 2018. \u201cCraniofacial Genetics: Where Have We Been and Where Are We Going?\u201d PLoS Genetics 14 (6): e1007438. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pgen.1007438.</ref><ref name=\":5\">Roosenboom, Jasmien, Greet Hens, Brooke C. Mattern, Mark D. Shriver, and Peter Claes. 2016. \u201cExploring the Underlying Genetics of Craniofacial Morphology through Various Sources of Knowledge.\u201d Edited by Ilker ERCAN. BioMed Research International 2016 (December): 3054578. https://doi.org/10.1155/2016/3054578.</ref>. Environmental causes have been found to contribute to craniofacial clefting, however, these are still influenced by and supported by genetic factors. Many studies, for example, have linked maternal smoking to increased CLP risk; however, the increased risk suggests that genes in metabolic pathways could still contribute to susceptibility or formation of CL/P<ref name=\":6\">Dixon, M.J., Marazita, M.L., Beaty, T.H., and Murray, J.C. (2011). Cleft lip and palate: synthesizing genetic and environmental influences. Nat Rev Genet 12, 167\u2013178.</ref>.\n\n==== Development and Inheritance ====\nThe craniofacial complex begins its progress in the fourth week of development, and results from [[neural crest]] cells migrating to form and fuse the facial primordia<ref name=\":1\" /><ref name=\":2\" />. Failures or deviations in this process result in craniofacial clefts, either CL or CP<ref name=\":0\" />. The range of variation in phenotype aligns with ancestry<ref name=\":1\" /><ref name=\":6\" />. Studies have found increased amounts of clefting in the relatives of patients with clefts, suggesting genetic factors are the underlying cause for CL/P<ref name=\":1\" />. Inheritance has a known and significant role in human craniofacial morphology. This is supported through cephalometric and anthropometric comparisons of family members including between triplets, twins, siblings, and parents and children<ref>The Role of Genetics in Craniofacial Morphology and Growth | Annual Review of Anthropology.</ref>.\n\n==== Genetic Experimentation ====\nGenetic factors of craniofacial clefting can be investigated and tracked through several methods including [[sequencing]] in humans, [[Genome-wide association study|Genome-wide association studies]] (GWAs), [[fate mapping]], expression analysis, and animal studies (knockout experiments or models with clefting from chemical mutagenesis)<ref>Facebase.org</ref>. [[Twin study|Twin studies]] and familial clustering have also revealed that facial structure and formation are genetically linked. Several genes have been associated with craniofacial disorders through experimentation, inlcuding sequencing Mendelian clefting syndromes<ref name=\":1\" />. Over 25 loci have been identified as potential influencers of craniofacial clefts across populations<ref name=\":4\" />.\n\n==== Linked Genes ====\nThe [[transforming growth factor]] (''TGF'') family has provided multiple candidate genes linked with craniofacial development and malformation<ref name=\":7\">Genetic and Teratogenic Approaches To Craniofacial Development - D.L. Young, R.A. Schneider, D. Hu, J.A. Helms, 2000.</ref><ref name=\":8\">Wilkie, A.O., and Morriss-Kay, G.M. (2001). Genetics of craniofacial development and malformation. Nat. Rev. Genet. 2, 458\u2013468.</ref><ref name=\":6\" /><ref name=\":2\" />. ''TGF'' is involved in cell migration, differentiation, and proliferation, as well as regulating the extracellular matrix<ref name=\":7\" />. Another gene that has been flagged as causal for craniofacial disorders, including CL/P, is [[IRF6|interferon regulatory factor 6]] or, ''[[IRF6]]''<ref name=\":1\" /><ref name=\":6\" /><ref name=\":9\">SPECC1L deficiency results in increased adherens junction stability and reduced cranial neural crest cell delamination. - PubMed - NCBI.</ref>. Mutations in ''IRF6'' cause [[Van der Woude syndrome]], the most common clefting syndrome<ref name=\":1\" />. [[VAX1|Ventral anterior homeobox 1]], ''VAX1,'' and [[Noggin (protein)|noggin]], ''NOG'', were identified with genome-wide significance for contributing to CL/P<ref name=\":6\" />. Additionally, mutations in ''SPECC1L'' have recently been identified as influential to facial structure formation, and as causal for syndromic facial clefting<ref name=\":9\" /><ref>Kruszka, P., Li, D., Harr, M.H., Wilson, N.R., Swarr, D., McCormick, E.M., Chiavacci, R.M., Li, M., Martinez, A.F., Hart, R.A., et al. (2015). Mutations in SPECC1L, encoding sperm antigen with calponin homology and coiled-coil domains 1-like, are found in some cases of autosomal dominant Opitz G/BBB syndrome. J. Med. Genet. 52, 104\u2013110.</ref>. Nonsyndromic CL/P has been associated with the transcription factor [[FOXE1|forkhead box protein E1]] (''FOXE1''), as mutations have resulted in cases of CL/P in mice<ref name=\":2\" />. Other genes which have been found to interact with or contribute to craniofacial clefting include ''FGFR''s, ''TWIST'', ''MSX''s, ''GREM1'', ''TCOF1'', ''PAX''s, ''MAFB'', ''ABCA4,'' and ''WNT'' allowing great cause for more research into the genetic basis for craniofacial disorders<ref name=\":3\" /><ref name=\":8\" /><ref name=\":4\" /><ref name=\":5\" /><ref name=\":6\" />.\n\n== Prevention ==\nBecause the cause of facial clefts still is unclear, it is difficult to say what may prevent children being born with facial clefts. It seems that [[folic acid]] contributes to lowering the risk of a child being born with a facial cleft.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1136/bmj.39079.618287.0B |pmid=17259187 |title=Folic acid supplements and risk of facial clefts: national population based case-control study |year=2007 |last1=Wilcox |first1=A.

E. |last9=Drevon |first9=C. A |journal=BMJ |volume=334 |issue=7591 |pages=464 |pmc=1808175  }}</ref>\n\n== Treatment ==\nThere is no single strategy for treatment of facial clefts, because of the large amount of variation in these clefts. Which kind of surgery is used depends on the type of clefting and which structures are involved. There is much discussion about the timing of reconstruction of bone and soft tissue. The problem with early reconstruction is the recurrence of the deformity due to the intrinsic restricted growth. This requires additional operations at a later age to make sure all parts of the face are in proportion.<ref>{{cite journal|doi=10.3109/02844318209006569 |pmid= 7051271|title=Adolescent Facial Morphology of Early Bone-Grafted Cleft Lip and Palate Patients|year=1982|last1=Friede|first1=Hans|last2=Johanson|first2=Bengt|journal=Scandinavian Journal of Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery and Hand Surgery|volume=16|pages=41\u201353|issue=1}}</ref> A disadvantage of early bone reconstruction is the chance to damage the tooth germs, which are located in the maxilla, just under the orbit. The soft tissue reconstruction can be done at an early age, but only if the used skin flap can be used again during a second operation. The timing of the operation depends on the urgency of the underlying condition. If the operation is necessary to function properly, it should be done at early age. The best aesthetic result is achieved when the incisions are positioned in areas which attract the least attention (they cover up the scars). If, however, the function of a part of the face isn\u2019t damaged, the operation depends on psychological factors and the facial area of reconstruction. \n \nThe treatment plan of a facial cleft is planned right after diagnosis. This plan includes every operation needed in the first 18 years of the patients life to reconstruct the face fully. \nIn this plan, a difference is made between problems that need to be solved to improve the health of the patient (coloboma) and problems that need to be solved for a better cosmetic result (hypertelorism). \n \nThe treatment of the facial clefts can be divided in different areas of the face: the cranial anomalies, the orbital and eye anomalies, the nose anomalies, the midface anomalies and the mouth anomalies.\n\n=== Treatment of the cranial anomalies ===\nThe most common cranial anomaly seen in combination with facial clefts is [[encephalocele]].\n\n==== Encephalocele ====\nThe treatment of encephalocele is based on surgery to repair the bony gap and provide adequate protection of the underlying brain. The question remains if the external brain tissue should be put back into the skull or if it is possible to cut off that piece of brain tissue, because its claimed that the external piece of brain tissue often isn\u2019t functional,<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1288/00005537-198208000-00008 |pmid= 7098736 |year=1982 |last1=Kamerer |first1=Donald B. |title= Temporal Bone Encephalocele ??? Diagnosis and Treatment |last2=Caparosa |first2=Ralph J. |journal=The Laryngoscope |volume=92 |issue=8 |pages=878\u2013882}}</ref> with the exception of a basal encephalocele, in which the pituitary gland can be found in the mouth.\n\n=== Treatment of orbital / eye anomalies ===\nThe most common orbital /eye anomalies seen in children with facial clefts are colobomas and vertical dystopia.\n\n==== Coloboma ====\nThe coloboma which occurs often in facial clefts is a cleft in the lower or upper eyelid. This should be closed as soon as possible, to prevent drought of the eye and a consecutive loss of vision.<ref>Patipa M et al., \"Surgical management of congenital eyelid coloboma\", Ophthalmic Surg. 1982 Mar;13(3):212-216 {{cite journal |pmid=7088491 |year=1982 |last1=Patipa |first1=M |last2=Wilkins |first2=RB |last3=Guelzow |first3=KW |title=Surgical management of congenital eyelid coloboma |volume=13 |issue=3 |pages=212\u20136 |journal=Ophthalmic Surgery }}</ref>\n\n==== Vertical orbital dystopia ====\nVertical orbital dystopia can occur in facial clefts when the orbital floor and/or the maxilla is involved in the cleft. Vertical orbital dystopia means that the eyes do not lay on the same horizontal line in the face (one eye is positioned lower than the other). The treatment is based on the reconstruction of this orbital floor, by either closing the boney cleft or reconstructing the orbital floor using a [[bone graft]].<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1097/SCS.0b013e3181e57241 |pmid=20613583 |title=Orbital Floor Reconstruction |year=2010 |last1=Tabrizi |first1=Reza |last2=Ozkan |first2=Taha Birkan |last3=Mohammadinejad |first3=Cyrus |last4=Minaee |first4=Nasim |journal=Journal of Craniofacial Surgery |volume=21 |issue=4 |pages=1142\u20131146 }}</ref>\n\n==== Hypertelorism ====\nThere are many types of operations which can be performed to treat a hypertelorism. 2 options are: box osteotomy and facial bipartition<ref>Marchad D & Arnaud E, \"Midface surgery from Tessier to distraction\", Childs Nerv Syst. 1999 Nov;15(11-12):681-94, {{ cite journal |doi=10.1007/s003810050458 |pmid= 10603010 |title=Midface surgery from Tessier to distraction |year=1999 |last1=Marchac |first1=D. |last2=Arnaud |first2=Eric |journal=Child's Nervous System |volume=15 |issue=11\u201312 |pages=681\u2013694}}</ref> (also referred to as a median fasciotomy).\nThe goal of the box osteotomy is to bring the orbits closer together by removing a part of the bone between the orbits, to detach both orbits from the surrounding bone structures and move both orbits more to the centre of the face. \nThe goal of the facial bipartition is not only to bring the orbits closer together, but also to create more space in the maxilla. This can be done by splitting the maxilla and the frontal bone, remove a triangular shaped piece of bone from the forehead and nasal bones and pulling the two pieces of forehead together. Not only will the hypertelorism be solved by pulling the frontal bone closer together, but because of this pulling, the space between the both parts of the maxilla will become wider.\n<center>\n<gallery>\nFile: Picture_box_osteotomy.jpg|<center> Box Osteotomy </center>\nFile: Picture_median_fasciotomy.jpg | <center> Facial Bipartition </center>\n</gallery>\n</center>\n\n=== Treatment of nose anomalies ===\nThe nose anomalies found in facial clefts vary. The main goal of the treatment is to reconstruct the nose to get a functional and esthetic acceptable result. A few possible treatment options are to reconstruct the nose with a forehead flap or reconstruct the nasal dorsum with a bone graft, for example a rib graft. The [[nasal reconstruction]] with a forehead flap is based on the repositioning of a skin flap from the forehead to the nose. A possible downside of this reconstruction is that once you performed it at a younger age, you can\u2019t lengthen the flap at a later stage. A second operation is often needed if the operation is done on early age, because the nose has a restricted growth in the cleft area. Repair of the [[Ala of nose|ala]] (wing of the nose) often requires the inset of cartilage graft, commonly taken from the ear.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1288/00005537-198505000-00003 |pmid=3990484 |year=1985 |last1=Tardy |first1=M.

This skinflap can be used for other operations in the further, as it can be raised again and transposed again. In the treatment of midface anomalies there are generally more operations needed. Bone tissue reconstruction of the midface often occurs later than the soft tissue reconstruction. The most common method to reconstruct the midface is by using the fracture/ incision lines described by [[Ren\u00e9 Le Fort]]. When the cleft involves the maxilla, it is likely that the impaired growth will result in a smaller maxillary bone in all 3 dimensions (height, projection, width).\n\n=== Treatment of mouth anomalies ===\nThere are several options for treatment of mouth anomalies like Tessier cleft number 2-3-7 . These clefts are also seen in various syndromes like Treacher Collins syndrome and hemifacial microsomia, which makes the treatment much more complicated. In this case, treatment of mouth anomalies is a part of the treatment of the syndrome.\n\n== See also ==\n'''Related articles'''\n\n* [[Ectrodactyly\u2013ectodermal dysplasia\u2013cleft syndrome]]\n* [[Cleft hand]]\n* [[Cleft lip and palate]]\n\n'''Syndromes'''\n\n* [[Treacher Collins syndrome]]\n* [[Hemifacial microsomia]]\n* [[Goldenhar syndrome]]\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist|2}}\n\n\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Facial Cleft}}\n[[Category:Facial features]]\n[[Category:Oral and maxillofacial surgery]]\n[[Category:Congenital disorders]]\n", "name_user": "Evalicht88", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eGenetic Experimentation:spelling error", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Craniofacial_cleft"}

The authority was a target area for the Labour Party, hoping to regain seats that they had lost to UKIP in 2014. However, the Conservatives pulled off some unexpected victories in several wards on the authority, including wins in Freshney and Immingham for the first time since the late 2000s, and in Yarborough, Park and Croft Baker, where they hadn't won seats for over 25 years, long before NELC's creation.\n\nSince the 2016 elections, former UKIP councillors Stephen Harness<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.conservativehome.com/localgovernment/2016/11/stephen-harness-why-i-have-left-ukip-and-joined-the-conservatives.html|title=Stephen Harness: Why I have left UKIP and joined the Conservatives|website=Conservative Home|language=en-US|access-date=2019-08-05}}</ref> and Matthew Stinson who were sat as Independents at the time, joined the Conservative Party, while two further UKIP councillors, Nick Pettigrew<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://grimsbynews.blogspot.com/2017/01/grimsby-councillor-quits-ukip-for-tories.html|title=Grimsby News: GRIMSBY COUNCILLOR QUITS UKIP FOR TORIES|last=Wryneck|first=The|date=2017-01-25|website=Grimsby News|access-date=2019-08-05}}</ref> and James Cairns<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.grimsbytelegraph.co.uk/news/grimsby-news/another-councillor-defects-ukip-tories-441376|title=Another councillor defects from Ukip to the Tories in the Brexit aftermath|date=2017-09-07|work=grimsbytelegraph|access-date=2019-08-05|language=en-GB|issn=0307-1235}}</ref>, joined the Conservatives in 2017.

The four-year seat was gained by Stewart Swinburn, a former Conservative councillor for the ward, who had lost his seat to Burton in 2011, and had failed to regain his seat in 2012, 2014 and 2016.\n\nShortly after these elections took place, a by-election was held to fill the vacancy in the Freshney ward in July 2018 due to the resignation of councillor Ray Sutton, following his decision to move out of the area. Labour's Sheldon Mill, who stood in Park in the elections in this set of elections, held the seat by a small margin of 42 votes over the Conservatives, but his win was shortlived and he lost the seat in the 2019 local elections to the Conservatives.\n\n==Ward results==\nVote share changes are compared with the 2016 elections, with the exceptions of Waltham, West Marsh and Wolds, which are compared with 2015.\n\n===Croft Baker===\n\n{{Election box begin |title=Croft Baker 2018}}\n\n{{Election box candidate with party link|\n   |party      = Conservative Party (UK)\n   |candidate  = Oliver Daniel William Freeston\n   |votes      = 1,340\t|percentage = 47.3\t|change     = +31.2 }}\n{{Election box candidate with party link|\n   |party      = Labour Party (UK)\n   |candidate  = Carole Anne Doherty\n   |votes      = 1,184\t|percentage = 41.8\t|change     = +1.3 }}\n{{Election box candidate with party link|\n   |party      = UK Independence Party\n   |candidate  = Clive Colam\n   |votes      = 163\t|percentage = 5.8\t|change     = -17.1 }}\n{{Election box candidate with party link|\n   |party      = Green Party of England and Wales\n   |candidate  = James William Barker\n   |votes      = 143\t|percentage = 5.1\t|change     = +1.0 }}\n{{Election box majority|\n  |votes = 156\t|percentage = 5.5\t|change = -12.1 }}\n{{Election box gain with party link\n  | winner     = Conservative Party (UK)\n  | loser      = Labour Party (UK)\n  | swing      =}}\n{{Election box end}}\n\nNote: Incumbent Labour councillor Matthew Brown sought re-election in Yarborough having failed to be re-selected by party members here.

However, the Conservatives pulled off some unexpected victories in several wards on the authority, including wins in Freshney and Immingham for the first time since the late 2000s, and in Yarborough, Park and Croft Baker, where they hadn't won seats for over 25 years, long before NELC's creation.\n\nSince the 2016 elections, former UKIP councillors Stephen Harness<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.conservativehome.com/localgovernment/2016/11/stephen-harness-why-i-have-left-ukip-and-joined-the-conservatives.html|title=Stephen Harness: Why I have left UKIP and joined the Conservatives|website=Conservative Home|language=en-US|access-date=2019-08-05}}</ref> and Matthew Stinson who were sat as Independents at the time, joined the Conservative Party, while two further UKIP councillors, Nick Pettigrew<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://grimsbynews.blogspot.com/2017/01/grimsby-councillor-quits-ukip-for-tories.html|title=Grimsby News: GRIMSBY COUNCILLOR QUITS UKIP FOR TORIES|last=Wryneck|first=The|date=2017-01-25|website=Grimsby News|access-date=2019-08-05}}</ref> and James Cairns<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.grimsbytelegraph.co.uk/news/grimsby-news/another-councillor-defects-ukip-tories-441376|title=Another councillor defects from Ukip to the Tories in the Brexit aftermath|date=2017-09-07|work=grimsbytelegraph|access-date=2019-08-05|language=en-GB|issn=0307-1235}}</ref>, joined the Conservatives in 2017.

Labour's Dave Bolton retained his seat on the authority by 3 votes after several recounts, but only for one year - the remaining term of office Burton had been elected for in 2015.
