Historically, they inhabited vast parts of it, as well as the western side of the [[island]] of [[Krk]] until 1875. However, due to several factors such as the [[industrialization]] and [[modernization]] of Istria during the [[socialist]] regime of [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia]], many Istro-Romanians [[emigrated]] to other places, be they cities in [[Croatia]] like [[Pula]] and [[Rijeka]] or areas such as [[New York City]], [[Trieste]] or [[Western Australia]]. The Istro-Romanians dwindled severely in number, being reduced to eight [[Human settlement|settlements]] on the Croatian side of Istria in which they do not represent the [[Ethnic majority|majority]].\n\nIt is known that the Istro-Romanians are actually not indigenous to Istria, since the differences between the [[Istro-Romanian language]] and the now [[Language death|extinct]] [[geographically]] close [[Dalmatian language|Dalmatian]] are notable. In addition, they count several similarities with the [[Transylvania]]n [[Romanians]] and [[Timok Vlachs]], suggesting that the Istro-Romanians originate from the current areas west of [[Romania]] or [[Serbia]]. Although it is not known exactly how and when, the Istro-Romanians settled in Istria, where they would remain for [[centuries]] until they began to suffer [[Cultural assimilation|assimilation]]. Even now, with several [[Voluntary association|associations]] and projects that aim to preserve their [[culture]] and with the support of both [[Croatian Government|Croatian]] and [[Romanian Government|Romanian]] [[government]]s, the Istro-Romanians are not officially recognized as a [[Minority languages of Croatia|national minority]].\n\nAlthough it has become widely popular and is now used almost exclusively, the term \"Istro-Romanian\" is a somewhat controversial [[scientific]] invention, which is not used by them to identify themselves. The Istro-Romanians prefer to use names derived from their native [[village]]s, which are [[Jesenovik]], [[Kostr\u010dani]], [[Letaj, Croatia|Letaj]], [[Nova Vas, Kr\u0161an|Nova Vas]], [[\u0160u\u0161njevica]], [[Zankovci]], the Brdo area and the isolated [[\u017dejane]]. Others also use \"[[Vlach]]\", but to refer to the entire Istro-Romanian population, the names ''rum\u00e2ri'' and ''rumeri'' are often employed. Their [[language]] is highly similar to [[Romanian language|Romanian]], both being part of the [[Balkan Romance languages]] family alongside [[Aromanian language|Aromanian]] and [[Megleno-Romanian language|Megleno-Romanian]], all descending from [[Proto-Romanian]]. However, Romania regards these ethnic groups as part of a \"broad definition\" of what a Romanian is, which is debatable and does not have a widely accepted view.\n\nThe Istro-Romanian culture has [[Folk costume|costumes]], [[Folk dance|dances]] and [[Folk song|songs]] with many similarities to those of Romania. [[Literature]] in Istro-Romanian is small, with the first [[book]] published in 1905. Historically, they were [[peasant]]s and [[shepherd]]s, with many of them being [[poor]] and without having received [[education]] until the 20th century. Today, the Istro-Romanian language has little use in education, [[News media|media]] and [[religion]], with the [[Croatian language|Croatian]] imposition in these and other domains. They are so few that they have been described as \"the smallest [[ethnolinguistic group]] in [[Europe]]\". It is thought that if their situation does not change, the Istro-Romanians will disappear in the following decades.\n\n==Names==\n===Endonym===\n[[File:Gheorghe Asachi (2).jpg|thumb|left|[[Gheorghe Asachi]], the first person to use the name \"Istro-Romanian\"]]\nThe term \"Istro-Romanian\" is commonly used among [[researcher]]s and [[linguist]]s to identify this [[Balkan Romance languages|Balkan Romance people]] from the [[Istrian Peninsula]].

The communities south of the U\u010dka and \u017dejane have historically had very few contacts until the intervention of Romanian researchers, as they spoke Croatian at local [[fair]]s. Because of this, the feeling of ethnic and linguistic unity between both communities is weak.<ref name=\":15\" /> Currently, very few Istro-Romanians identify themselves as Romanian, and never with much enthusiasm. A large part of them affiliate with the [[Regions of Croatia|region]] in which they live, that is, Istria. This not only happens in the Istro-Romanians; approximately 25,000 people in Istria declare to be Istrian before any other [[nationality]], which is sometimes referred to as \"Istrianess\". Those Istro-Romanians who preferred to declare a national affiliation chose Croatian and a few Italian. Many Istro-Romanians think that the [[Croatian Government]] is not doing enough for the survival of their language and culture. They express a strong [[National pride|ethnic pride]] and their desire to pass their language to other [[generation]]s, although those in the villages south of the U\u010dka are more pessimistic about their future. There, the [[language shift]] to Croatian is more advanced than in \u017dejane, but the inhabitants are more protectionist regarding their culture. In \u017dejane, some Istro-Romanians still speak in Istro-Romanian with their grandchildren, and express less awareness about their extinction.<ref name=\":23\" /> Nowadays, the biggest goal of the Istro-Romanians is the full recognition by Croatia as an ethnic minority and a wider use of their language in education, newspapers, [[TV broadcasting]] and [[radio]], all of this with the support of the Croatian Government.<ref name=\":15\" />\n\n==Geographical distribution==\n[[File:Istro-Romanian villages.png|thumb|250px|Villages populated by the Istro-Romanians nowadays]]\nThe territory where the Istro-Romanians live was once covered with [[forest]]s, [[pasture]]s and [[lake]]s, ideal for [[livestock]] or [[charcoal]] production.

All this caused a decrease in the number of Istro-Romanians, which have been reduced to only eight settlements today.<ref name=\":27\" />\n\nNow, there are two identifiable groups of Istro-Romanians.

Thus, \u017dejane, \u0160u\u0161njevica, Nova Vas, Jesenovik, Letaj, Kostr\u010dani, Zankovci and Brdo become ''Jei\u0103n'', ''Su\u0219\u0144\u00e9vi\u021b\u0119'', ''N\u00f3selo'' or ''N\u00f3solo'', ''Suc\u00f3dru'', ''Let\u00e5i'', ''Cost\u00e2r\u010dan'', ''Zankovci'' and ''B\u00e2rdo'' (''Brig'' for the hamlet). Other regions such as \u0106i\u0107arija or Istria are called ''Cicearia''<ref name=\":0\" /> and ''Istrie'', respectively.<ref name=\":32\" /> According to the memory of some, Istro-Romanian was also spoken in [[Gradinje, Cerovlje|Gradinje]] and [[Grobnik, Istria County|Grobnik]] and the hamlets Doli\u0161\u0107ina, Trkovci and Perasi until recently.<ref name=\":27\" /> All of these villages at the south of the U\u010dka constituted the Italian municipality of Valdarsa.<ref name=\":19\" />\n\nDetailed information of an unspecified date reports that, of the 134 inhabitants of \u017dejane, 53 (39%) can speak Istro-Romanian.<ref name=\":21\" /> In the southern villages, the Istro-Romanians make up a bit more than a quarter of the population, with approximately 75 (27%) speakers out of 276 in 2016. Therefore, there are about 120 Istro-Romanians living in their villages. Both communities, although now connected with roads, live in different [[Administrative divisions of Croatia|Croatian administrative regions]]; the southern villages are located in the Istria County and \u017dejane, despite being geographically in Istria, is part of [[Primorje-Gorski Kotar County]].<ref name=\":23\" /> However, the number of ethnic Istro-Romanians or people with Istro-Romanian ancestry in Istria could be as high as 1,500, even if they no longer speak the language and practice only some (or none) of their traditions.<ref name=\":15\" />\n\nAfter the end of the Second World War, many Istro-Romanians abandoned their native villages. In fact, the population of the villages today are less than a fifth of what they were in 1945. Many of them moved to nearby cities and towns, such as [[Kr\u0161an]], [[Labin]], [[Matulji]], [[Opatija]], Pazin, [[Pula]] and Rijeka. It is estimated that a total of 450 Istro-Romanians live in Croatia outside their settlements. Others decided to emigrate to other parts of the world, especially to [[New York City]] and [[Western Australia]]. The Istro-Romanian community living outside Croatia is made up of around 500 people.<ref name=\":23\" /> It is estimated that the total of Istro-Romanians of \u017dejane who now live abroad is 195, four times larger than the population residing in \u017dejane. Although the exact number of the diaspora of the Istro-Romanians from the south of the U\u010dka is unknown, it is probably higher than that of \u017dejane since the emigration there was more potent and the population itself of the villages together was bigger than that of \u017dejane.<ref name=\":21\" />\n\n==Culture==\n===Folklore===\n====Dances and songs====\n[[File:Dormanfalva.jpg|thumb|Similar costume of a Romanian woman in [[D\u0103rm\u0103ne\u0219ti]], in the Romanian part of [[Western Moldavia|Moldavia]]]]\nIstro-Romanian [[art]] is characterized by the domination of [[dance]]s and songs.<ref name=\":16\" /> Istro-Romanian [[holiday]]s tend to be somewhat austere, but accompanied by traditional [[Folk instrument|musical instruments]] and [[Folk dance|dances]]. In one of these dances, called ''Columbaro'', the peasants of the villages spend hours holding each other's [[hand]]s in a closed circle, giving steps without order and with jumps without cadence. Dancers often form an arch with their hands through which a human chain passes underneath. According to Leca Morariu, this dance is similar to those of [[Bukovina]] (a part of which is in Romania). One of the favorite dances of the Istro-Romanians is the ''Kolo'', initially with a circular shape and then developing in ''skkocigori'', that is, with high jumps. The dancers hold their hands and form a circle, slowly spinning all together under the [[music]]. Another dance is literally called \"under the feet\", in which a man and a woman or two of each dance together while [[hugging]]. Researchers who have studied Istro-Romanian dances have highlighted their [[primitivism]].<ref name=\":31\">{{cite journal|url=https://revistatransilvania.ro/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/14-Elena-Ramona-Potoroaca-Istro-Romanians\u2019-heritages-.-A-comparative-analysis.pdf|title=Tradi\u021bii istrorom\u00e2ne - trecut \u0219i prezent.

That is why some of them have classified them into the following categories: songs, elegant songs, [[satires]] and diverse creations. Traian Cantemir, a Romanian researcher, published in 1935 ''Motivele dispari\u021biei poeziei populare la istrorom\u00e2ni'' (\"Reasons for the disappearance of popular poetry of the Istro-Romanians\") in the magazine ''F\u0103t-Frumos'', expressing concern regarding the future of their [[poetry]]. Most of the time, the [[Verse (poetry)|verses]] of the [[poem]]s were accompanied by a song, becoming [[popular song]]s for [[travel]]s. Some foreign non-native travelers reported that their songs were like \"ancient poems\" and that \"a long exclamation or rather, a barbaric and prolonged cry precedes any verse\". The Istro-Romanian traveler could casually find a partner with whom he had a musical dialogue, keeping both entertained and with whom they practiced [[improvisation]]. Another author who investigated in depth the Istro-Romanian songs was the Romanian writer Petru Iroaie, identifying their similarities with those of [[Maramure\u0219]] and Bukovina and the main [[Motif (narrative)|motifs]] of them. Italian and especially Croatian influence diminished the knowledge of these songs, being mostly maintained by the [[elderly]] during the beginning of the 20th century. In addition, songs with some Croatian influences gradually began to circulate in the villages. Today, some young Istro-Romanians have some distrust or even fear of giving voice to those songs. In the Istro-Romanian language, as in other ones, the song is related to social realities, whereby the main subjects dealt with work in the [[Field (agriculture)|field]], [[love]], warfare and interethnic relations. Today, the Istro-Romanians cannot remember certain words of their language, and therefore some old [[lyrics]] and verses can no longer be read. This has led Cantemir to define them as \"fossils\".<ref name=\":31\" /> However, some Istro-Romanian songs have managed to prevail until today. Among them are ''Knd am tire'' (\"When [I asked] you\"), ''Mes-am o\u010da \u0161i kola'' (\"I went around\"), ''Oj ljepure nu \u017euka'' (\"Do not dance, rabbit\") and ''Fina feta'' (\"A nice girl\").<ref name=\":16\" />\n\nThe famous [[folk group]] \u017dejanski Zvon\u010dari (\u017dejane's Bell Ringers), founded by Mauro Dori\u010di\u0107<ref name=\":15\" /> in 1997, advocates the preservation of the old [[carnival]]esque Istro-Romanian traditions. It is made up of the [[zvon\u010dari]] (bell ringers), an exclusively male carnival dance group, and the \"Kntaduri\" ([[singers]]), an ''[[a cappella]]'' singing group. The association has also published new songs mainly in the Istro-Romanian dialect of \u017dejane, such as ''Tu ver fi ama'' (\"You will be mine\"), ''Pustu an \u017dejan'' (\"Carnival in \u017dejane\") and even an [[anthem]], ''\u017dejanska'', in both Croatian and Istro-Romanian.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://vlaski-zejanski.com/upload_data/editor/files/Resources-Music_library-Zejanski_kntaduri-fin-eng.pdf|title=\u017dejanski Kntaduri (The \u017dejanan Singers)|first=Mauro|last=Dori\u010di\u0107|publisher=Preservation of the Vla\u0161ki and \u017dejanski Language|location=\u017dejane|year=2009}}</ref> On the day of the carnival, the zvon\u010dari ring their [[bell]]s from [[morning]] to [[evening]], going from house to house and receiving food like [[bacon]] or [[Egg as food|eggs]]. At [[night]], [[sandwich]]es made with the food received from the houses are distributed. On the day of the carnival there are also ''crabulele'', boys and girls between 10 and 20 years old with [[harmonic]]s and [[mask]]s, who go from house to house dancing and telling [[joke]]s. One of the children has a [[basket]] for the [[gift]]s and the rest sticks to defend against [[stranger]]s if necessary.<ref name=\":31\" />\n\n====Costumes====\n[[File:Zejanski i halubajski zvoncari EM 300109.jpg|thumb|left|Costumes of the [[zvon\u010dari]] of \u017dejane during the [[Night of Museums]] at the [[Ethnographic Museum, Zagreb|Ethnographic Museum of Zagreb]]]]\nThe inhabitants of \u017dejane wore unique [[hat]]s that \"scared\" the nearby populations. These were put so that the back of the hat covered the [[face]], so that they could [[Theft|steal]] to those who had [[money]], for reasons that researchers have described as \"well grounded\". Another hat worn in \u017dejane was the ''comaracu'', with several colored [[rope]]s. The lower rope was made of [[velvet]] and the rest of [[silk]]. In the elderly, these ropes were dark, and in the [[youth]], colorful and bright (dominating [[blue]], [[yellow]], [[red]] and [[green]]). The hats of the latter were decorated with [[peacock feather]]s and [[flower bouquet]]s. These hats were similar to the ones worn between the [[Mure\u0219 River|Mure\u0219]] and [[T\u00e2rnava]] rivers in Transylvania. The [[costume]]s of men had a tight [[shirt]] with long, low and narrow [[suspenders]], as well as ''[[Opanak|opinci]]'' (traditional [[shoe]]s, similar to those of the Romanians). On the shirt, they wore a [[waistcoat]] called ''crujat''. In [[winter]], they wore a [[cape]] called ''halea'', and on the [[neck]] they had a [[scarf]] called ''fa\u0219\u0103''. During the 18th century, women wore a [[headscarf]] with their [[hair]] [[Braid (hairstyle)|braided]]. In the 19th century they used a ''tulpan''. The white shirt reached to the [[knees]] and was covered by a colorful [[dress]] called ''barhan''. They also had ''opinci''. According to Burada, their [[leg]]s were covered by [[sock]]s called ''bicivele'' and with [[garter]]s called ''podvezi''. Today's Istro-Romanians have difficulty describing the [[traditional costume]]s of their ancestors and few know the names of each [[clothes]].<ref name=\":31\" />\n\nThese traditional costumes are still preserved in \u017dejane, but only during the carnival or artistic events. However, the number of owners is very low, most of them being [[parent]]s or [[grandparent]]s, who pass them to the youth as a special symbol of the Istro-Romanian identity. Today's women's costumes are made up of a ''fa\u021bo'' (red scarf), an ''opleici'' (white shirt with an [[embroidery]] at the base of the neck), a ''pocirneka'' (black dress with a red [[ribbon]] and sleeveless) and a ''firtuhu'' (an [[apron]] put on the dress). Under the dress there is a white and tight [[skirt]], to give a special look to the costume. At the [[waist]], the dress is connected with the ''coani\u021ba'' (the widest \"[[Belt (clothing)|belt]]\") and the ''tisuta'' (the thinnest \"belt\"), both with different colors. The legs, covered with the ''bicivi'', wear black ''postole'' as [[footwear]]. Now, men wear a shirt or a black [[jacket]]. The [[pants]], which can be white or black, are called ''braghesi''. On the [[head]] they wear a black hat, and on the [[feet]], ''postole'', like women.<ref name=\":31\" />\n\nThe costume of the zvon\u010dari consists of a typical [[sailor shirt]] with two ''fa\u021bole'' (white [[batiste]]s). On the [[back]] is a [[sheepskin]] garment to which three large bells are attached. A ''kumaroak'' is carried on the head, in which hundreds of colorful strips that extend to the person's back are connected. Above the strips, there are two [[rose]]s that symbolize the [[sun]]. The pants and footwear are not really different from those of the traditional costume.<ref name=\":31\" />\n\n===Language===\n{{main|Istro-Romanian language}}\n[[File:Romance 20c en.png|thumb|300px|Position of the Romance languages in [[Europe]], with Istro-Romanian and [[Istriot language|Istriot]] marked in Istria]]\nIstro-Romanians speak the Istro-Romanian language (sometimes abbreviated as IR), part of the Balkan Romance languages spoken exclusively natively in Istria, Croatia. They have been described as the smallest [[ethnolinguistic group]] in [[Europe]]. Their language is classified by the [[UNESCO]] as a \"seriously endangered language\" because of the small number of fluent speakers the language has, education in Istro-Romanian is limited and the language is not usually used in many domains and the majority of younger speakers are adults, among others. Vrzi\u0107's [[Language revitalization|revitalization]] project fulfills some of these points, however.<ref name=\":29\" /> According to several mostly Romanian researchers,<ref name=\":15\" /><ref name=\":16\" /><ref name=\":0\" /><ref name=\":31\" /> the Istro-Romanian language is one of the four traditional and historical [[dialect]]s of Romanian, alongside [[Aromanian language|Aromanian]], [[Megleno-Romanian language|Megleno-Romanian]] and Daco-Romanian (linguistic name for the Romanian from Romania and its surroundings), all with a common ancestor, [[Proto-Romanian]].<ref name=\":29\" /> However, Istro-Romanian can also be considered a language separated from Romanian by others, so there is no widely accepted view.<ref name=\":16\" /> Anyway, it is considered the [[daughter language]] (descendant) of Daco-Romanian, both being closer to each other than Aromanian and Megleno-Romanian are.<ref name=\":29\" /> Nevertheless, Istro-Romanian is strongly influenced by Croatian, with it affecting its [[Morphology (linguistics)|morphology]] and with many linguistic loans, including [[function word]]s. This has led some authors to describe it as a \"[[mixed language]]\".<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nThe Istro-Romanian consists of two main variants, a northern one (in \u017dejane) and a southern one (in the villages south of the U\u010dka). For example, for the [[oblique case]], the variety of \u017dejane (\"Zejanski\") preserves synthetic marking, while the southern variety (\"Vlaski\") uses only [[preposition]]al marking, but neither of them marks the [[accusative case]] (e.g. \"I can see Lara\" would be \"po\u010d ved\u0119 Lara\", literally \"can see Lara\"). Another difference is that in Zejanski, generally [[Masculine gender|masculine]] nouns of Slavic origin mark the [[vocative case]] with \"-e\", while those of Latin origin with \"-(u)le\". In Vlaski, some nouns are marked with \"-e\" and some \"-u\".<ref name=\":29\" /> But although Istro-Romanian has two main dialects, each village has its own speech, differing slightly among the southern villages.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1HwyAAAAIAAJ|title=Enciclopedia limbilor romanice|first=Mioara|last=Avram|editor-first=Marius|editor-last=Sala|publisher=Editura \u0218tiin\u021bific\u0103 \u0219i Enciclopedic\u0103|location=Bucharest|p=335|year=1989|language=ro|isbn=9789732900437}}</ref> The dialect of Krk, called by Croatian researchers as ''kr\u010dkorumunjski'' (literally \"Krko-Romanian\"), has been little studied and knowledge of it is minimal. The only texts known are [[Hail Mary]] and The [[Lord's Prayer]]. Even so, it is known that \"Krko-Romanian\" was an Istro-Romanian dialect as it had its characteristic rhotacism, as can be seen in Fint\u0209ra and ''\u0161piri\u0161\u00f4r''.<ref name=\":33\" />\n\nThere has never been a consensus on what [[writing system]] should be used for the [[Istro-Romanian alphabet]], so Croatian and Romanian researchers have been recording and transcribing texts using different systems, with [[Croatian orthography|Croatian]], [[Romanian orthography|Romanian]] or mixed orthographic elements. Vrzi\u0107 has proposed the idea of unifying the writing system, which has been implemented on her website and is based on Croatian [[spelling]]. These changes may vary, for example, the word \"when\", to ''k\u00e2nd'' (Croatian-based), ''c\u0103nd'' (Romanian-based) and ''c\u00e2nd'' (mixed).<ref name=\":29\" />\n\nHowever, Istro-Romanian is not the only language spoken by the Istro-Romanians. In fact, they represent a [[diglossic]] community (that is, they use more than one language), with no [[monolingual]] speakers of Istro-Romanian remaining. They usually also use the [[Chakavian dialect]] of Croatian and the elderly who attended to Italian schools, Italian or Istro-Venetian (the Istrian dialect of [[Venetian language|Venetian]]). Generally, the youth have no knowledge or understanding of the language, and prefer to use Croatian. Those Istro-Romanians who left the villages and migrated to the cities often use Croatian as the [[family]] language. The diaspora does not usually have knowledge of the language, result of intermarriages.<ref>{{cite journal|url=http://istro-romanian.com/history/1995_orbanic-status.htm|title=Status attuale delle comunit\u00e0 istroromene|first=Sr\u0111a|last=Orbani\u0107|journal=Annales.

These are built in [[stone]], with double walls, one or two [[floor]]s and are covered with [[reed mace]] or burnt [[clay]]. Inside this \"carp\", there is a large [[chimney]] with a [[column]] above where \"a [[Vault (architecture)|vault]] that receives the [[smoke]] and takes it to the [[oven]]\" is placed. Near the chimney is the ''paleta'' or ''lop\u0103ri\u021ba'', a long [[metal]] \"[[shovel]]\" or \"pole\" with which the [[wood]] is moved or removed. In the center of the vault above the chimney there is usually a large [[chain]] called ''catena'' where the ''cadera'' (a [[cauldron]]) is attached. In it, water is boiled for [[cooking]] and ''[[polenta]]'' ([[m\u0103m\u0103liga]]). According to Burada, [[Plate (dishware)|plates]] and [[cutlery]] were hung around the chimney.<ref name=\":31\" />\n\nThe \"carp\" that covers the house, bigger than the Romanian ones in Transylvania, serves as a refuge for people and also for [[animal]]s such as [[chicken]]s, [[pig]]s and sometimes, goats. To the left of the carp there is a [[room]] without chimney, with the door with the other room always open in winter to warm it. In this room there are several objects that are used only at special moments of the life of the owners. There is a ''mis\u0103'' ([[Table (furniture)|table]]), ''scanie'' ([[chair]]s) and a ''scriniu'' ([[closet]]), and on the boards over the [[ceiling]], several portions of [[food]] such as cheese, bacon and pork legs, where \"they [[Smoking (cooking)|smoke]] very well, as if they were in the vault of the chimney\".<ref name=\":31\" />\n\nThe [[sheets]] are of great importance among Istro-Romanian women. These can be in square stone [[Structural support|supports]] or in wooden [[bed]]s. In these beds there can be sacks of [[straw]] or [[maize]] on which there were [[pillow]]s at their ends, some of them stuffed with straw and maize as well and others with [[goose]] [[feather]]s or [[horsehair]]. With the exception of the shirts and headscarfs that cover women's heads, every [[textile]] products used at home are usually made of [[wool]] and worked at home.<ref name=\":31\" />\n\nThose Istro-Romanians with [[social status]] or numerous families may have another room. Their houses have retained much of the [[architectural]] features of the past, and therefore have not changed much over time.<ref name=\":31\" />\n\n===Literature and proverbs===\n[[File:Title page Calindaru lu rumeri din Istrie 1905.png|thumb|[[Title page]] of ''Calindaru lu rumeri din Istrie'']]\n[[Literature]] written in the Istro-Romanian language is scarce and quite recent. The first book written in this language, ''Calindaru lu rumeri din Istrie'',<ref name=\":8\" /> was barely published in 1905. Its two authors were Glavina, an Istro-Romanian who always advocated the education of his people,<ref name=\":20\" /> and Diculescu.<ref name=\":0\" /> In this book, they gather words, [[proverb]]s and stories of the Istro-Romanians. Glavina would publish more works later, such as ''I romeni dell'Istria'' (The Romanians of Istria) and ''L'educazione nazionale'' (The national education) in the early 1920s. However, these texts, although about the Istro-Romanians, are in the Italian language. After his death, his wife Fiorella Zagabria published ''Promemoria e lettere'', a [[posthumous work]] in which Glavina's last texts are collected. The \"Istro-Romanian [[hymn]]\", showed below, is located there.<ref name=\":20\" />\n\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n|'''Imnul istro-romanilor (Romanian)'''<ref name=\":19\" />||'''Inno istrorumeno (Italian)'''<ref name=\":19\" />||'''Istro-Romanian hymn (English)'''<ref name=\":19\" />\n|-\n||\nRoma, Roma e mama noastr\u0103<br>noi romani r\u0103m\u00e2nem<br>Rom\u00e2nia e sora noastr\u0103<br>tot un s\u00e2nge avem.\n\nNu suntem singuri pe lume<br>\u0219i ne-avem fra\u021bi<br>italiani cu mare nume<br>m\u00e2na cu noi da\u021bi.\n\nCa sa fim frate \u0219i sor\u0103<br>cum a dat Dumnezeu<br>sa tr\u0103im p\u00e2n\u0103 la moarte<br>eu \u0219i tu \u0219i tu \u0219i eu.\n||\nRoma Roma \u00e8 la nostra madre<br>noi rimaniamo romani<br>la Romenia \u00e8 la nostra sorella<br>abbiamo tutti un sangue.\n\nNon siamo soli al mondo<br>se abbiamo fratelli<br>gli Italiani dal nome illustre<br>ci hanno dato una mano.\n\nSiamo fratelli e sorelle<br>come l'ha stabilito il Signore<br>cos\u00ec lo sosterremo fino alla morte<br>lo con te e tu con me.\n||\nRome, Rome is our mother<br>we remain Roman<br>Romania is our sister<br>we all have one blood.\n\nWe are not alone in the world<br>and we have each other as brothers<br>Italians of great name<br>you give your hands with us.\n\nSo we are brothers and sisters<br>as God has established<br>may we live to death<br>me and you and you and me.\n|}\n\nThe second book in Istro-Romanian, ''Lu frati no\u0219tri: libru lu rumeri din Istrie'', was published in 1928. Its author was a Romanian, Alexandru Leca Morariu, who made a trip to Istria in 1927 and another one in 1928 to study the Istro-Romanians.<ref name=\":32\" /> The first Istro-Romanian newspaper, ''Scrisoare c\u0103tre fr\u00e5\u021b rumer'', has been publishing cult literature, such as the poems of the brothers from Nova Vas Gabriela and Gabriel Vretenar of 1997.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://istro-romanian.com/literature/vretenar_poetry.htm|title=Poesie di Gabriela e Gabriel Vretenar|newspaper=Scrisoare c\u0103tre fr\u00e5\u021b rumer|year=1997|language=it}}</ref> In 2011, the Istro-Romanian Antonio Dianich publishes ''Vocabolario istroromeno\u2011italiano.

Today, they know less than before. Some of the best known proverbs are ''nu ie c\u00e5rne far de ose'' (\"there is no [[meat]] without [[bone]]s\"), ''lu Domnu \u0219i lu Dr\u00eecu nu se pote sluji o vot\u0119'' (\"you cannot serve [[God]] and the [[Devil]] at the same\ntime\"), ''mora bure m\u00e5cire \u0219i bov\u00e5n'' (\"the good [[Mill (grinding)|mill]] can [even] grind [[Rock (geology)|rocks]]\"), ''din cala lu omu bet \u0219i Domnu se d\u00e5ie la o bande'' (\"even God avoids the [[drunk]]\") and ''c\u00e5sta lume f\u0103cuta ie cu sc\u00e5le: uri mergu \u0103n sus, \u00e5l'\u021bi \u0103n jos'' (\"the world is made of [[stairs]]: some go up, others down\").<ref name=\":16\" />\n\n===Occupations===\n[[File:Postavljanje oglarske kope leta 1931.jpg|thumb|left|Pile of wood for making charcoal, similar to the Istro-Romanian ones, in 1931, Slovenia]]\nTraditionally and historically, the Istro-Romanians were shepherds, an occupation that would disappear with the centuries. They carried their [[sheep]] dressed in wool suits, a hat and ''opinci'' with [[knot]]s around the feet. They also had a [[walking stick]] [[Carving|carved]] with things of [[daily life]] that were sung to pass the time faster. The sheep were taken to pastures in which they would remain a month, time in which a small shepherd [[hut]] of wood was built. Inside it were sheepherding [[tool]]s such as a cauldron for ''[[ca\u0219]]'' (a type of cheese), a kind of [[container]] of dry soil where food was eaten and [[spoon]]s, the ''kikara'' (a [[cup]]), where fresh ''ca\u0219'' was placed during a day, and the [[bucket]] with which the sheep were [[Milking|milked]], among others. The process of making ''ca\u0219'' of the Istro-Romanians is the same as in Romania.<ref name=\":31\" />\n\nSince the end of the 19th century, the economy and [[wealth]] of the Istro-Romanians has weakened severely. Their [[wine]] [[crop]]s dried up, and agriculture is no longer as productive as before. They tried to replace the dried [[grapevine]]s with American ones, which became increasingly difficult for them. [[Drought]]s are another problem. The situation in livestock is no different. They never practiced [[animal breeding]] much. \"The [[horse]]s can't stand. In \u0160u\u0161njevica there are only three horses. Among the [[bird]]s there are only chickens. Sheepherding is weak. I have barely been able to find cheese for sale in \u017dejane. There are few sheep, and no goats\".<ref name=\":31\" />\n\nA characteristic of the inhabitants of \u017dejane was the production of charcoal, taking place in the mountains and then selling them in mostly Rijeka or Opatija. To produce it, once the wood (always [[beech]]) was collected, the Istro-Romanians stayed in a [[haystack]] called ''gljevaricsa'', two to three meters high and six to seven meters wide. Then, the wood was placed in the middle surrounded by straw and dry wood so that the [[fire]] could extend when it was lighted. Once produced, the charcoal was taken to the cities in order to market them.<ref name=\":31\" />  Specially practiced by men was cultivation in \u0160u\u0161njevica of culinary sage, \"undertaking a great business\". Burada is, however, the only one to present this occupation. Many of them worked in other places outside the villages. Women, on the other hand, were generally [[Housewife|housewives]], although they could also be ''furlani'', a kind of itinerant weavers.<ref name=\":31\" /> Other Istro-Romanians became [[miner]]s or sailors.<ref name=\":15\" /> From the 20th century onwards, the Istro-Romanians' [[needs]] and occupations change due to the modernization of the [[society]] in which they live. Some choose to go to the cities and others stay.<ref name=\":31\" />\n\nCurrently, the Istro-Romanians in \u017dejane are mainly engaged in agriculture and wood exploitation; very few continue with sheepherding. A good part of the men are workers in nearby cities. In the southern villages, agriculture is the largest source of [[income]]. There are still people cultivating grapevines in Brdo. Material conditions are relatively better in \u017dejane than in the southern villages, and therefore it has a better quality of life.<ref name=\":0\" /> The production of charcoal is no longer very active, and is generally practiced for [[tourist]]s.<ref name=\":15\" />\n\n===Religion===\n[[File:Cefal\u00f9 Pantocrator retouched.jpg|thumb|[[Christ Pantocrator]] [[mosaic]] in the [[Cefal\u00f9 Cathedral]], [[Sicily]]]]\nThe Istro-Romanians are [[Christians]], being the only Balkan Romance people belonging to the [[Roman Catholic Church]].<ref name=\":15\" /> Historically, the [[Christian Church|church]] has been the largest point of exposure for the Istro-Romanians to Croatian assimilation. Currently, it does not support the Istro-Romanian cause, with all services being given in Croatian.<ref name=\":23\" /> This has been the case since the second half of the 19th century. In fact, it is recorded that Croatian priests attracted mayors and other persons through [[corruption]] to act as they liked, disfavoring the Istro-Romanians.<ref name=\":14\" />\n\nPrior to this, the Austrian Empire allowed the [[ordination]] of priests among the Istro-Romanians (such as Micetici, born in Brdo), with services given in Istro-Romanian. Nowadays, it has been proposed that the [[Catholic Church in Romania]] could delegate three or four Romanian-speaking priests to the villages.<ref name=\":12\" />\n\nExamples of religious terms in Istro-Romanian are ''bes\u0119reca'' (\"church\"), ''catolica'' (\"Catholic\"), ''Domnedzeu'' (\"God\"), ''Isus'' (\"[[Jesus]]\") and ''sv\u00e2nt\u0103'' (\"holy\").<ref name=\":29\" />\n\nIt is possible that the Istro-Romanians were originally [[Orthodox Church|Orthodox]]. In 1861, the Italian linguist [[Graziadio Isaia Ascoli]] stated that Jesenovik's church was Orthodox before becoming a Catholic one.<ref name=\":30\" />\n\n==Notable figures==\n*[[Branko \u010crnac Tusta]] (family from unspecified location at \u0106i\u0107arija), singer.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.muzika.hr/ja-sjecam-se-branko-crnac-tusta/|title=Ja sje\u0107am se \u2013 Branko \u010crnac Tusta|date=14 October 2014|publisher=Muzika.hr|accessdate=21 January 2020|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150323004329/http://www.muzika.hr/clanak/48303/komentari/ja-sjecam-se-branko-crnac-tusta.aspx|archivedate=23 March 2015|language=hr}}</ref>\n*Alberto Cvecich (Nova Vas), priest.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.editfiume.com/archivio/lavoce/2007/070224/esuli.htm|title=\u00c8 scomparso a Pisa don Alberto Cvecich|first=Roberto|last=Palisca|newspaper=[[La Voce del Popolo]]|date=24 February 2007|language=it}}</ref>\n*Antonio Dianich (father from \u0160u\u0161njevica, mother from Kostr\u010dani),<ref name=\":25\">{{cite book|url=https://www.academia.edu/33038322|title=Societas et universitas.

However, due to several factors such as the [[industrialization]] and [[modernization]] of Istria during the [[socialist]] regime of [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia]], many Istro-Romanians [[emigrated]] to other places, be they cities in [[Croatia]] like [[Pula]] and [[Rijeka]] or areas such as [[New York City]], [[Trieste]] or [[Western Australia]]. The Istro-Romanians dwindled severely in number, being reduced to eight [[Human settlement|settlements]] on the Croatian side of Istria in which they do not represent the [[Ethnic majority|majority]].\n\nIt is known that the Istro-Romanians are actually not indigenous to Istria, since the differences between the [[Istro-Romanian language]] and the now [[Language death|extinct]] [[geographically]] close [[Dalmatian language|Dalmatian]] are notable. In addition, they count several similarities with the [[Transylvania]]n [[Romanians]] and [[Timok Vlachs]], suggesting that the Istro-Romanians originate from the current areas west of [[Romania]] or [[Serbia]]. Although it is not known exactly how and when, the Istro-Romanians settled in Istria, where they would remain for [[centuries]] until they began to suffer [[Cultural assimilation|assimilation]]. Even now, with several [[Voluntary association|associations]] and projects that aim to preserve their [[culture]] and with the support of both [[Croatian Government|Croatian]] and [[Romanian Government|Romanian]] [[government]]s, the Istro-Romanians are not officially recognized as a [[Minority languages of Croatia|national minority]].\n\nAlthough it has become widely popular and is now used almost exclusively, the term \"Istro-Romanian\" is a somewhat controversial [[scientific]] invention, which is not used by them to identify themselves. The Istro-Romanians prefer to use names derived from their native [[village]]s, which are [[Jesenovik]], [[Kostr\u010dani]], [[Letaj, Croatia|Letaj]], [[Nova Vas, Kr\u0161an|Nova Vas]], [[\u0160u\u0161njevica]], [[Zankovci]], the Brdo area and the isolated [[\u017dejane]]. Others also use \"[[Vlach]]\", but to refer to the entire Istro-Romanian population, the names ''rum\u00e2ri'' and ''rumeri'' are often employed. Their [[language]] is highly similar to [[Romanian language|Romanian]], both being part of the [[Balkan Romance languages]] family alongside [[Aromanian language|Aromanian]] and [[Megleno-Romanian language|Megleno-Romanian]], all descending from [[Proto-Romanian]]. However, Romania regards these ethnic groups as part of a \"broad definition\" of what a Romanian is, which is debatable and does not have a widely accepted view.\n\nThe Istro-Romanian culture has [[Folk costume|costumes]], [[Folk dance|dances]] and [[Folk song|songs]] with many similarities to those of Romania. [[Literature]] in Istro-Romanian is small, with the first [[book]] published in 1905. Historically, they were [[peasant]]s and [[shepherd]]s, with many of them being [[poor]] and without having received [[education]] until the 20th century. Today, the Istro-Romanian language has little use in education, [[News media|media]] and [[religion]], with the [[Croatian language|Croatian]] imposition in these and other domains. They are so few that they have been described as \"the smallest [[ethnolinguistic group]] in [[Europe]]\". It is thought that if their situation does not change, the Istro-Romanians will disappear in the following decades.\n\n==Names==\n===Endonym===\n[[File:Gheorghe Asachi (2).jpg|thumb|left|[[Gheorghe Asachi]], the first person to use the name \"Istro-Romanian\"]]\nThe term \"Istro-Romanian\" is commonly used among [[researcher]]s and [[linguist]]s to identify this [[Balkan Romance languages|Balkan Romance people]] from the [[Istrian Peninsula]].

The communities south of the U\u010dka and \u017dejane have historically had very few contacts until the intervention of Romanian researchers, as they spoke Croatian at local [[fair]]s. Because of this, the feeling of ethnic and linguistic unity between both communities is weak.<ref name=\":15\" /> Currently, very few Istro-Romanians identify themselves as Romanian, and never with much enthusiasm. A large part of them affiliate with the [[Regions of Croatia|region]] in which they live, that is, Istria. This not only happens in the Istro-Romanians; approximately 25,000 people in Istria declare to be Istrian before any other [[nationality]], which is sometimes referred to as \"Istrianess\". Those Istro-Romanians who preferred to declare a national affiliation chose Croatian and a few Italian. Many Istro-Romanians think that the [[Croatian Government]] is not doing enough for the survival of their language and culture. They express a strong [[National pride|ethnic pride]] and their desire to pass their language to other [[generation]]s, although those in the villages south of the U\u010dka are more pessimistic about their future. There, the [[language shift]] to Croatian is more advanced than in \u017dejane, but the inhabitants are more protectionist regarding their culture. In \u017dejane, some Istro-Romanians still speak in Istro-Romanian with their grandchildren, and express less awareness about their extinction.<ref name=\":23\" /> Nowadays, the biggest goal of the Istro-Romanians is the full recognition by Croatia as an ethnic minority and a wider use of their language in education, newspapers, [[TV broadcasting]] and [[radio]], all of this with the support of the Croatian Government.<ref name=\":15\" />\n\n==Geographical distribution==\n[[File:Istro-Romanian villages.png|thumb|250px|Villages populated by the Istro-Romanians nowadays]]\nThe territory where the Istro-Romanians live was once covered with [[forest]]s, [[pasture]]s and [[lake]]s, ideal for [[livestock]] or [[charcoal]] production.

All this caused a decrease in the number of Istro-Romanians, which have been reduced to only eight settlements today.<ref name=\":27\" />\n\nNow, there are two identifiable groups of Istro-Romanians.

Thus, \u017dejane, \u0160u\u0161njevica, Nova Vas, Jesenovik, Letaj, Kostr\u010dani, Zankovci and Brdo become ''Jei\u0103n'', ''Su\u0219\u0144\u00e9vi\u021b\u0119'', ''N\u00f3selo'' or ''N\u00f3solo'', ''Suc\u00f3dru'', ''Let\u00e5i'', ''Cost\u00e2r\u010dan'', ''Zankovci'' and ''B\u00e2rdo'' (''Brig'' for the hamlet). Other regions such as \u0106i\u0107arija or Istria are called ''Cicearia''<ref name=\":0\" /> and ''Istrie'', respectively.<ref name=\":32\" /> According to the memory of some, Istro-Romanian was also spoken in [[Gradinje, Cerovlje|Gradinje]] and [[Grobnik, Istria County|Grobnik]] and the hamlets Doli\u0161\u0107ina, Trkovci and Perasi until recently.<ref name=\":27\" /> All of these villages at the south of the U\u010dka constituted the Italian municipality of Valdarsa.<ref name=\":19\" />\n\nDetailed information of an unspecified date reports that, of the 134 inhabitants of \u017dejane, 53 (39%) can speak Istro-Romanian.<ref name=\":21\" /> In the southern villages, the Istro-Romanians make up a bit more than a quarter of the population, with approximately 75 (27%) speakers out of 276 in 2016. Therefore, there are about 120 Istro-Romanians living in their villages. Both communities, although now connected with roads, live in different [[Administrative divisions of Croatia|Croatian administrative regions]]; the southern villages are located in the Istria County and \u017dejane, despite being geographically in Istria, is part of [[Primorje-Gorski Kotar County]].<ref name=\":23\" /> However, the number of ethnic Istro-Romanians or people with Istro-Romanian ancestry in Istria could be as high as 1,500, even if they no longer speak the language and practice only some (or none) of their traditions.<ref name=\":15\" />\n\nAfter the end of the Second World War, many Istro-Romanians abandoned their native villages. In fact, the population of the villages today are less than a fifth of what they were in 1945. Many of them moved to nearby cities and towns, such as [[Kr\u0161an]], [[Labin]], [[Matulji]], [[Opatija]], Pazin, [[Pula]] and Rijeka. It is estimated that a total of 450 Istro-Romanians live in Croatia outside their settlements. Others decided to emigrate to other parts of the world, especially to [[New York City]] and [[Western Australia]]. The Istro-Romanian community living outside Croatia is made up of around 500 people.<ref name=\":23\" /> It is estimated that the total of Istro-Romanians of \u017dejane who now live abroad is 195, four times larger than the population residing in \u017dejane. Although the exact number of the diaspora of the Istro-Romanians from the south of the U\u010dka is unknown, it is probably higher than that of \u017dejane since the emigration there was more potent and the population itself of the villages together was bigger than that of \u017dejane.<ref name=\":21\" />\n\n==Culture==\n===Folklore===\n====Dances and songs====\n[[File:Dormanfalva.jpg|thumb|Similar costume of a Romanian women in [[D\u0103rm\u0103ne\u0219ti]], in the Romanian part of [[Western Moldavia|Moldavia]]]]\nIstro-Romanian [[art]] is characterized by the domination of [[dance]]s and songs.<ref name=\":16\" /> Istro-Romanian [[holiday]]s tend to be somewhat austere, but accompanied by traditional [[Folk instrument|musical instruments]] and [[Folk dance|dances]]. In one of these dances, called ''Columbaro'', the peasants of the villages spend hours holding each other's [[hand]]s in a closed circle, giving steps without order and with jumps without cadence. Dancers often form an arch with their hands through which a human chain passes underneath. According to Leca Morariu, this dance is similar to those of [[Bukovina]] (a part of which is in Romania). One of the favorite dances of the Istro-Romanians is the ''Kolo'', initially with a circular shape and then developing in ''skkocigori'', that is, with high jumps. The dancers hold their hands and form a circle, slowly spinning all together under the [[music]]. Another dance is literally called \"under the feet\", in which a man and a woman or two of each dance together while [[hugging]]. Researchers who have studied Istro-Romanian dances have highlighted their [[primitivism]].<ref name=\":31\">{{cite journal|url=https://revistatransilvania.ro/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/14-Elena-Ramona-Potoroaca-Istro-Romanians\u2019-heritages-.-A-comparative-analysis.pdf|title=Tradi\u021bii istrorom\u00e2ne - trecut \u0219i prezent.

That is why some of them have classified them into the following categories: songs, elegant songs, [[satires]] and diverse creations. Traian Cantemir, a Romanian researcher, published in 1935 ''Motivele dispari\u021biei poeziei populare la istrorom\u00e2ni'' (\"Reasons for the disappearance of popular poetry of the Istro-Romanians\") in the magazine ''F\u0103t-Frumos'', expressing concern regarding the future of their [[poetry]]. Most of the time, the [[Verse (poetry)|verses]] of the [[poem]]s were accompanied by a song, becoming [[popular song]]s for [[travel]]s. Some foreign non-native travelers reported that their songs were like \"ancient poems\" and that \"a long exclamation or rather, a barbaric and prolonged cry precedes any verse\". The Istro-Romanian traveler could casually find a partner with whom he had a musical dialogue, keeping both entertained and with whom they practiced [[improvisation]]. Another author who investigated in depth the Istro-Romanian songs was the Romanian writer Petru Iroaie, identifying their similarities with those of [[Maramure\u0219]] and Bukovina and the main [[Motif (narrative)|motifs]] of them. Italian and especially Croatian influence diminished the knowledge of these songs, being mostly maintained by the [[elderly]] during the beginning of the 20th century. In addition, songs with some Croatian influences gradually began to circulate in the villages. Today, some young Istro-Romanians have some distrust or even fear of giving voice to those songs. In the Istro-Romanian language, as in other ones, the song is related to social realities, whereby the main subjects dealt with work in the [[Field (agriculture)|field]], [[love]], warfare and interethnic relations. Today, the Istro-Romanians cannot remember certain words of their language, and therefore some old [[lyrics]] and verses can no longer be read. This has led Cantemir to define them as \"fossils\".<ref name=\":31\" /> However, some Istro-Romanian songs have managed to prevail until today. Among them are ''Knd am tire'' (\"When [I asked] you\"), ''Mes-am o\u010da \u0161i kola'' (\"I went around\"), ''Oj ljepure nu \u017euka'' (\"Do not dance, rabbit\") and ''Fina feta'' (\"A nice girl\").<ref name=\":16\" />\n\nThe famous [[folk group]] \u017dejanski Zvon\u010dari (\u017dejane's Bell Ringers), founded by Mauro Dori\u010di\u0107<ref name=\":15\" /> in 1997, advocates the preservation of the old [[carnival]]esque Istro-Romanian traditions. It is made up of the [[zvon\u010dari]] (bell ringers), an exclusively male carnival dance group, and the \"Kntaduri\" ([[singers]]), an ''[[a cappella]]'' singing group. The association has also published new songs mainly in the Istro-Romanian dialect of \u017dejane, such as ''Tu ver fi ama'' (\"You will be mine\"), ''Pustu an \u017dejan'' (\"Carnival in \u017dejane\") and even an [[anthem]], ''\u017dejanska'', in both Croatian and Istro-Romanian.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://vlaski-zejanski.com/upload_data/editor/files/Resources-Music_library-Zejanski_kntaduri-fin-eng.pdf|title=\u017dejanski Kntaduri (The \u017dejanan Singers)|first=Mauro|last=Dori\u010di\u0107|publisher=Preservation of the Vla\u0161ki and \u017dejanski Language|location=\u017dejane|year=2009}}</ref> On the day of the carnival, the zvon\u010dari ring their [[bell]]s from [[morning]] to [[evening]], going from house to house and receiving food like [[bacon]] or [[Egg as food|eggs]]. At [[night]], [[sandwich]]es made with the food received from the houses are distributed. On the day of the carnival there are also ''crabulele'', boys and girls between 10 and 20 years old with [[harmonic]]s and [[mask]]s, who go from house to house dancing and telling [[joke]]s. One of the children has a [[basket]] for the [[gift]]s and the rest sticks to defend against [[stranger]]s if necessary.<ref name=\":31\" />\n\n====Costumes====\n[[File:Zejanski i halubajski zvoncari EM 300109.jpg|thumb|left|Costumes of the [[zvon\u010dari]] of \u017dejane during the [[Night of Museums]] at the [[Ethnographic Museum, Zagreb|Ethnographic Museum of Zagreb]]]]\nThe inhabitants of \u017dejane wore unique [[hat]]s that \"scared\" the nearby populations. These were put so that the back of the hat covered the [[face]], so that they could [[Theft|steal]] to those who had [[money]], for reasons that researchers have described as \"well grounded\". Another hat worn in \u017dejane was the ''comaracu'', with several colored [[rope]]s. The lower rope was made of [[velvet]] and the rest of [[silk]]. In the elderly, these ropes were dark, and in the [[youth]], colorful and bright (dominating [[blue]], [[yellow]], [[red]] and [[green]]). The hats of the latter were decorated with [[peacock feather]]s and [[flower bouquet]]s. These hats were similar to the ones worn between the [[Mure\u0219 River|Mure\u0219]] and [[T\u00e2rnava]] rivers in Transylvania. The [[costume]]s of men had a tight [[shirt]] with long, low and narrow [[suspenders]], as well as ''[[Opanak|opinci]]'' (traditional [[shoe]]s, similar to those of the Romanians). On the shirt, they wore a [[waistcoat]] called ''crujat''. In [[winter]], they wore a [[cape]] called ''halea'', and on the [[neck]] they had a [[scarf]] called ''fa\u0219\u0103''. During the 18th century, women wore a [[headscarf]] with their [[hair]] [[Braid (hairstyle)|braided]]. In the 19th century they used a ''tulpan''. The white shirt reached to the [[knees]] and was covered by a colorful [[dress]] called ''barhan''. They also had ''opinci''. According to Burada, their [[leg]]s were covered by [[sock]]s called ''bicivele'' and with [[garter]]s called ''podvezi''. Today's Istro-Romanians have difficulty describing the [[traditional costume]]s of their ancestors and few know the names of each [[clothes]].<ref name=\":31\" />\n\nThese traditional costumes are still preserved in \u017dejane, but only during the carnival or artistic events. However, the number of owners is very low, most of them being [[parent]]s or [[grandparent]]s, who pass them to the youth as a special symbol of the Istro-Romanian identity. Today's women's costumes are made up of a ''fa\u021bo'' (red scarf), an ''opleici'' (white shirt with an [[embroidery]] at the base of the neck), a ''pocirneka'' (black dress with a red [[ribbon]] and sleeveless) and a ''firtuhu'' (an [[apron]] put on the dress). Under the dress there is a white and tight [[skirt]], to give a special look to the costume. At the [[waist]], the dress is connected with the ''coani\u021ba'' (the widest \"[[Belt (clothing)|belt]]\") and the ''tisuta'' (the thinnest \"belt\"), both with different colors. The legs, covered with the ''bicivi'', wear black ''postole'' as [[footwear]]. Now, men wear a shirt or a black [[jacket]]. The [[pants]], which can be white or black, are called ''braghesi''. On the [[head]] they wear a black hat, and on the [[feet]], ''postole'', like women.<ref name=\":31\" />\n\nThe costume of the zvon\u010dari consists of a typical [[sailor shirt]] with two ''fa\u021bole'' (white [[batiste]]s). On the [[back]] is a [[sheepskin]] garment to which three large bells are attached. A ''kumaroak'' is carried on the head, in which hundreds of colorful strips that extend to the person's back are connected. Above the strips, there are two [[rose]]s that symbolize the [[sun]]. The pants and footwear are not really different from those of the traditional costume.<ref name=\":31\" />\n\n===Language===\n{{main|Istro-Romanian language}}\n[[File:Romance 20c en.png|thumb|300px|Position of the Romance languages in [[Europe]], with Istro-Romanian and [[Istriot language|Istriot]] marked in Istria]]\nIstro-Romanians speak the Istro-Romanian language (sometimes abbreviated as IR), part of the Balkan Romance languages spoken exclusively natively in Istria, Croatia. They have been described as the smallest [[ethnolinguistic group]] in [[Europe]]. Their language is classified by the [[UNESCO]] as a \"seriously endangered language\" because of the small number of fluent speakers the language has, education in Istro-Romanian is limited and the language is not usually used in many domains and the majority of younger speakers are adults, among others. Vrzi\u0107's [[Language revitalization|revitalization]] project fulfills some of these points, however.<ref name=\":29\" /> According to several mostly Romanian researchers,<ref name=\":15\" /><ref name=\":16\" /><ref name=\":0\" /><ref name=\":31\" /> the Istro-Romanian language is one of the four traditional and historical [[dialect]]s of Romanian, alongside [[Aromanian language|Aromanian]], [[Megleno-Romanian language|Megleno-Romanian]] and Daco-Romanian (linguistic name for the Romanian from Romania and its surroundings), all with a common ancestor, [[Proto-Romanian]].<ref name=\":29\" /> However, Istro-Romanian can also be considered a language separated from Romanian by others, so there is no widely accepted view.<ref name=\":16\" /> Anyway, it is considered the [[daughter language]] (descendant) of Daco-Romanian, both being closer to each other than Aromanian and Megleno-Romanian are.<ref name=\":29\" /> Nevertheless, Istro-Romanian is strongly influenced by Croatian, with it affecting its [[Morphology (linguistics)|morphology]] and with many linguistic loans, including [[function word]]s. This has led some authors to describe it as a \"[[mixed language]]\".<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nThe Istro-Romanian consists of two main variants, a northern one (in \u017dejane) and a southern one (in the villages south of the U\u010dka). For example, for the [[oblique case]], the variety of \u017dejane (\"Zejanski\") preserves synthetic marking, while the southern variety (\"Vlaski\") uses only [[preposition]]al marking, but neither of them marks the [[accusative case]] (e.g. \"I can see Lara\" would be \"po\u010d ved\u0119 Lara\", literally \"can see Lara\"). Another difference is that in Zejanski, generally [[Masculine gender|masculine]] nouns of Slavic origin mark the [[vocative case]] with \"-e\", while those of Latin origin with \"-(u)le\". In Vlaski, some nouns are marked with \"-e\" and some \"-u\".<ref name=\":29\" /> But although Istro-Romanian has two main dialects, each village has its own speech, differing slightly among the southern villages.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1HwyAAAAIAAJ|title=Enciclopedia limbilor romanice|first=Mioara|last=Avram|editor-first=Marius|editor-last=Sala|publisher=Editura \u0218tiin\u021bific\u0103 \u0219i Enciclopedic\u0103|location=Bucharest|p=335|year=1989|language=ro|isbn=9789732900437}}</ref> The dialect of Krk, called by Croatian researchers as ''kr\u010dkorumunjski'' (literally \"Krko-Romanian\"), has been little studied and knowledge of it is minimal. The only texts known are [[Hail Mary]] and The [[Lord's Prayer]]. Even so, it is known that \"Krko-Romanian\" was an Istro-Romanian dialect as it had its characteristic rhotacism, as can be seen in Fint\u0209ra and ''\u0161piri\u0161\u00f4r''.<ref name=\":33\" />\n\nThere has never been a consensus on what [[writing system]] should be used for the [[Istro-Romanian alphabet]], so Croatian and Romanian researchers have been recording and transcribing texts using different systems, with [[Croatian orthography|Croatian]], [[Romanian orthography|Romanian]] or mixed orthographic elements. Vrzi\u0107 has proposed the idea of unifying the writing system, which has been implemented on her website and is based on Croatian [[spelling]]. These changes may vary, for example, the word \"when\", to ''k\u00e2nd'' (Croatian-based), ''c\u0103nd'' (Romanian-based) and ''c\u00e2nd'' (mixed).<ref name=\":29\" />\n\nHowever, Istro-Romanian is not the only language spoken by the Istro-Romanians. In fact, they represent a [[diglossic]] community (that is, they use more than one language), with no [[monolingual]] speakers of Istro-Romanian remaining. They usually also use the [[Chakavian dialect]] of Croatian and the elderly who attended to Italian schools, Italian or Istro-Venetian (the Istrian dialect of [[Venetian language|Venetian]]). Generally, the youth have no knowledge or understanding of the language, and prefer to use Croatian. Those Istro-Romanians who left the villages and migrated to the cities often use Croatian as the [[family]] language. The diaspora does not usually have knowledge of the language, result of intermarriages.<ref>{{cite journal|url=http://istro-romanian.com/history/1995_orbanic-status.htm|title=Status attuale delle comunit\u00e0 istroromene|first=Sr\u0111a|last=Orbani\u0107|journal=Annales.

These are built in [[stone]], with double walls, one or two [[floor]]s and are covered with [[reed mace]] or burnt [[clay]]. Inside this \"carp\", there is a large [[chimney]] with a [[column]] above where \"a [[Vault (architecture)|vault]] that receives the [[smoke]] and takes it to the [[oven]]\" is placed. Near the chimney is the ''paleta'' or ''lop\u0103ri\u021ba'', a long [[metal]] \"[[shovel]]\" or \"pole\" with which the [[wood]] is moved or removed. In the center of the vault above the chimney there is usually a large [[chain]] called ''catena'' where the ''cadera'' (a [[cauldron]]) is attached. In it, water is boiled for [[cooking]] and ''[[polenta]]'' ([[m\u0103m\u0103liga]]). According to Burada, [[Plate (dishware)|plates]] and [[cutlery]] were hung around the chimney.<ref name=\":31\" />\n\nThe \"carp\" that covers the house, bigger than the Romanian ones in Transylvania, serves as a refuge for people and also for [[animal]]s such as [[chicken]]s, [[pig]]s and sometimes, goats. To the left of the carp there is a [[room]] without chimney, with the door with the other room always open in winter to warm it. In this room there are several objects that are used only at special moments of the life of the owners. There is a ''mis\u0103'' ([[Table (furniture)|table]]), ''scanie'' ([[chair]]s) and a ''scriniu'' ([[closet]]), and on the boards over the [[ceiling]], several portions of [[food]] such as cheese, bacon and pork legs, where \"they [[Smoking (cooking)|smoke]] very well, as if they were in the vault of the chimney\".<ref name=\":31\" />\n\nThe [[sheets]] are of great importance among Istro-Romanian women. These can be in square stone [[Structural support|supports]] or in wooden [[bed]]s. In these beds there can be sacks of [[straw]] or [[maize]] on which there were [[pillow]]s at their ends, some of them stuffed with straw and maize as well and others with [[goose]] [[feather]]s or [[horsehair]]. With the exception of the shirts and headscarfs that cover women's heads, every [[textile]] products used at home are usually made of [[wool]] and worked at home.<ref name=\":31\" />\n\nThose Istro-Romanians with [[social status]] or numerous families may have another room. Their houses have retained much of the [[architectural]] features of the past, and therefore have not changed much over time.<ref name=\":31\" />\n\n===Literature and proverbs===\n[[File:Title page Calindaru lu rumeri din Istrie 1905.png|thumb|[[Title page]] of ''Calindaru lu rumeri din Istrie'']]\n[[Literature]] written in the Istro-Romanian language is scarce and quite recent. The first book written in this language, ''Calindaru lu rumeri din Istrie'',<ref name=\":8\" /> was barely published in 1905. Its two authors were Glavina, an Istro-Romanian who always advocated the education of his people,<ref name=\":20\" /> and Diculescu.<ref name=\":0\" /> In this book, they gather words, [[proverb]]s and stories of the Istro-Romanians. Glavina would publish more works later, such as ''I romeni dell'Istria'' (The Romanians of Istria) and ''L'educazione nazionale'' (The national education) in the early 1920s. However, these texts, although about the Istro-Romanians, are in the Italian language. After his death, his wife Fiorella Zagabria published ''Promemoria e lettere'', a [[posthumous work]] in which Glavina's last texts are collected. The \"Istro-Romanian [[hymn]]\", showed below, is located there.<ref name=\":20\" />\n\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n|'''Imnul istro-romanilor (Romanian)'''<ref name=\":19\" />||'''Inno istrorumeno (Italian)'''<ref name=\":19\" />||'''Istro-Romanian hymn (English)'''<ref name=\":19\" />\n|-\n||\nRoma, Roma e mama noastr\u0103<br>noi romani r\u0103m\u00e2nem<br>Rom\u00e2nia e sora noastr\u0103<br>tot un s\u00e2nge avem.\n\nNu suntem singuri pe lume<br>\u0219i ne-avem fra\u021bi<br>italiani cu mare nume<br>m\u00e2na cu noi da\u021bi.\n\nCa sa fim frate \u0219i sor\u0103<br>cum a dat Dumnezeu<br>sa tr\u0103im p\u00e2n\u0103 la moarte<br>eu \u0219i tu \u0219i tu \u0219i eu.\n||\nRoma Roma \u00e8 la nostra madre<br>noi rimaniamo romani<br>la Romenia \u00e8 la nostra sorella<br>abbiamo tutti un sangue.\n\nNon siamo soli al mondo<br>se abbiamo fratelli<br>gli Italiani dal nome illustre<br>ci hanno dato una mano.\n\nSiamo fratelli e sorelle<br>come l'ha stabilito il Signore<br>cos\u00ec lo sosterremo fino alla morte<br>lo con te e tu con me.\n||\nRome, Rome is our mother<br>we remain Roman<br>Romania is our sister<br>we all have one blood.\n\nWe are not alone in the world<br>and we have each other as brothers<br>Italians of great name<br>you give your hands with us.\n\nSo we are brothers and sisters<br>as God has established<br>may we live to death<br>me and you and you and me.\n|}\n\nThe second book in Istro-Romanian, ''Lu frati no\u0219tri: libru lu rumeri din Istrie'', was published in 1928. Its author was a Romanian, Alexandru Leca Morariu, who made a trip to Istria in 1927 and another one in 1928 to study the Istro-Romanians.<ref name=\":32\" /> The first Istro-Romanian newspaper, ''Scrisoare c\u0103tre fr\u00e5\u021b rumer'', has been publishing cult literature, such as the poems of the brothers from Nova Vas Gabriela and Gabriel Vretenar of 1997.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://istro-romanian.com/literature/vretenar_poetry.htm|title=Poesie di Gabriela e Gabriel Vretenar|newspaper=Scrisoare c\u0103tre fr\u00e5\u021b rumer|year=1997|language=it}}</ref> In 2011, the Istro-Romanian Antonio Dianich publishes ''Vocabolario istroromeno\u2011italiano.

Today, they know less than before. Some of the best known proverbs are ''nu ie c\u00e5rne far de ose'' (\"there is no [[meat]] without [[bone]]s\"), ''lu Domnu \u0219i lu Dr\u00eecu nu se pote sluji o vot\u0119'' (\"you cannot serve [[God]] and the [[Devil]] at the same\ntime\"), ''mora bure m\u00e5cire \u0219i bov\u00e5n'' (\"the good [[Mill (grinding)|mill]] can [even] grind [[Rock (geology)|rocks]]\"), ''din cala lu omu bet \u0219i Domnu se d\u00e5ie la o bande'' (\"even God avoids the [[drunk]]\") and ''c\u00e5sta lume f\u0103cuta ie cu sc\u00e5le: uri mergu \u0103n sus, \u00e5l'\u021bi \u0103n jos'' (\"the world is made of [[stairs]]: some go up, others down\").<ref name=\":16\" />\n\n===Occupations===\n[[File:Postavljanje oglarske kope leta 1931.jpg|thumb|left|Pile of wood for making charcoal, similar to the Istro-Romanian ones, in 1931, Slovenia]]\nTraditionally and historically, the Istro-Romanians were shepherds, an occupation that would disappear with the centuries. They carried their [[sheep]] dressed in wool suits, a hat and ''opinci'' with [[knot]]s around the feet. They also had a [[walking stick]] [[Carving|carved]] with things of [[daily life]] that were sung to pass the time faster. The sheep were taken to pastures in which they would remain a month, time in which a small shepherd [[hut]] of wood was built. Inside it were sheepherding [[tool]]s such as a cauldron for ''[[ca\u0219]]'' (a type of cheese), a kind of [[container]] of dry soil where food was eaten and [[spoon]]s, the ''kikara'' (a [[cup]]), where fresh ''ca\u0219'' was placed during a day, and the [[bucket]] with which the sheep were [[Milking|milked]], among others. The process of making ''ca\u0219'' of the Istro-Romanians is the same as in Romania.<ref name=\":31\" />\n\nSince the end of the 19th century, the economy and [[wealth]] of the Istro-Romanians has weakened severely. Their [[wine]] [[crop]]s dried up, and agriculture is no longer as productive as before. They tried to replace the dried [[grapevine]]s with American ones, which became increasingly difficult for them. [[Drought]]s are another problem. The situation in livestock is no different. They never practiced [[animal breeding]] much. \"The [[horse]]s can't stand. In \u0160u\u0161njevica there are only three horses. Among the [[bird]]s there are only chickens. Sheepherding is weak. I have barely been able to find cheese for sale in \u017dejane. There are few sheep, and no goats\".<ref name=\":31\" />\n\nA characteristic of the inhabitants of \u017dejane was the production of charcoal, taking place in the mountains and then selling them in mostly Rijeka or Opatija. To produce it, once the wood (always [[beech]]) was collected, the Istro-Romanians stayed in a [[haystack]] called ''gljevaricsa'', two to three meters high and six to seven meters wide. Then, the wood was placed in the middle surrounded by straw and dry wood so that the [[fire]] could extend when it was lighted. Once produced, the charcoal was taken to the cities in order to market them.<ref name=\":31\" />  Specially practiced by men was cultivation in \u0160u\u0161njevica of culinary sage, \"undertaking a great business\". Burada is, however, the only one to present this occupation. Many of them worked in other places outside the villages. Women, on the other hand, were generally [[Housewife|housewives]], although they could also be ''furlani'', a kind of itinerant weavers.<ref name=\":31\" /> Other Istro-Romanians became [[miner]]s or sailors.<ref name=\":15\" /> From the 20th century onwards, the Istro-Romanians' [[needs]] and occupations change due to the modernization of the [[society]] in which they live. Some choose to go to the cities and others stay.<ref name=\":31\" />\n\nCurrently, the Istro-Romanians in \u017dejane are mainly engaged in agriculture and wood exploitation; very few continue with sheepherding. A good part of the men are workers in nearby cities. In the southern villages, agriculture is the largest source of [[income]]. There are still people cultivating grapevines in Brdo. Material conditions are relatively better in \u017dejane than in the southern villages, and therefore it has a better quality of life.<ref name=\":0\" /> The production of charcoal is no longer very active, and is generally practiced for [[tourist]]s.<ref name=\":15\" />\n\n===Religion===\n[[File:Cefal\u00f9 Pantocrator retouched.jpg|thumb|[[Christ Pantocrator]] [[mosaic]] in the [[Cefal\u00f9 Cathedral]], [[Sicily]]]]\nThe Istro-Romanians are [[Christians]], being the only Balkan Romance people belonging to the [[Roman Catholic Church]].<ref name=\":15\" /> Historically, the [[Christian Church|church]] has been the largest point of exposure for the Istro-Romanians to Croatian assimilation. Currently, it does not support the Istro-Romanian cause, with all services being given in Croatian.<ref name=\":23\" /> This has been the case since the second half of the 19th century. In fact, it is recorded that Croatian priests attracted mayors and other persons through [[corruption]] to act as they liked, disfavoring the Istro-Romanians.<ref name=\":14\" />\n\nPrior to this, the Austrian Empire allowed the [[ordination]] of priests among the Istro-Romanians (such as Micetici, born in Brdo), with services given in Istro-Romanian. Nowadays, it has been proposed that the [[Catholic Church in Romania]] could delegate three or four Romanian-speaking priests to the villages.<ref name=\":12\" />\n\nExamples of religious terms in Istro-Romanian are ''bes\u0119reca'' (\"church\"), ''catolica'' (\"Catholic\"), ''Domnedzeu'' (\"God\"), ''Isus'' (\"[[Jesus]]\") and ''sv\u00e2nt\u0103'' (\"holy\").<ref name=\":29\" />\n\nIt is possible that the Istro-Romanians were originally [[Orthodox Church|Orthodox]]. In 1861, the Italian linguist [[Graziadio Isaia Ascoli]] stated that Jesenovik's church was Orthodox before becoming a Catholic one.<ref name=\":30\" />\n\n==Notable figures==\n*[[Branko \u010crnac Tusta]] (family from unspecified location at \u0106i\u0107arija), singer.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.muzika.hr/ja-sjecam-se-branko-crnac-tusta/|title=Ja sje\u0107am se \u2013 Branko \u010crnac Tusta|date=14 October 2014|publisher=Muzika.hr|accessdate=21 January 2020|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150323004329/http://www.muzika.hr/clanak/48303/komentari/ja-sjecam-se-branko-crnac-tusta.aspx|archivedate=23 March 2015|language=hr}}</ref>\n*Alberto Cvecich (Nova Vas), priest.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.editfiume.com/archivio/lavoce/2007/070224/esuli.htm|title=\u00c8 scomparso a Pisa don Alberto Cvecich|first=Roberto|last=Palisca|newspaper=[[La Voce del Popolo]]|date=24 February 2007|language=it}}</ref>\n*Antonio Dianich (father from \u0160u\u0161njevica, mother from Kostr\u010dani),<ref name=\":25\">{{cite book|url=https://www.academia.edu/33038322|title=Societas et universitas.

A total of 21 women competed in this event, limited to [[j\u016bd\u014dka]] with a body weight of more than 78 kilograms. Preliminary rounds started at 12:00 Noon [[China Standard Time|CST]]. [[Repechage]] finals, semifinals, bouts for bronze medals and the final were held at 18:00pm CST.\n\nThis event was the heaviest of the women's judo weight classes, allowing competitors with over 78 kilograms of body mass. Like all other judo events, bouts lasted five minutes. If the bout was still tied at the end, it was extended for another five-minute, sudden-death period; if neither judoka scored during that period, the match is decided by the judges. The tournament bracket consisted of a single-elimination contest culminating in a gold medal match. There was also a repechage to determine the winners of the two bronze medals. Each judoka who had lost to a semifinalist competed in the repechage. The two judokas who lost in the semifinals faced the winner of the opposite half of the bracket's repechage in bronze medal bouts.\n\n==Qualifying athletes==\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|-\n!

+78&nbsp;kg''' (also known as ''heavyweight'') tournament in the '''[[judo at the 2008 Summer Olympics]]''' was held on August 15 at the [[Beijing Science and Technology University Gymnasium]]. A total of 21 women competed in this event, limited to [[j\u016bd\u014dka]] with a body weight of more than 78 kilograms. Preliminary rounds started at 12:00 Noon [[China Standard Time|CST]]. [[Repechage]] finals, semifinals, bouts for bronze medals and the final were held at 18:00pm CST.\n\nThis event was the heaviest of the women's judo weight classes, allowing competitors with over 78 kilograms of body mass. Like all other judo events, bouts lasted five minutes. If the bout was still tied at the end, it was extended for another five-minute, sudden-death period; if neither judoka scored during that period, the match is decided by the judges. The tournament bracket consisted of a single-elimination contest culminating in a gold medal match. There was also a repechage to determine the winners of the two bronze medals. Each judoka who had lost to a semifinalist competed in the repechage. The two judokas who lost in the semifinals faced the winner of the opposite half of the bracket's repechage in bronze medal bouts.\n\n==Tournament results==\n\n==Qualifying athletes==\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|-\n!

Electrical contacts made from [[busbar]]s (the larger silver-colored strips) and fingers (the smaller ones) are printed on the [[silicon]] [[wafer (electronics)|wafer]].]]\n[[File:Photovoltaic cell.svg|thumb|Symbol of a Photovoltaic cell.]]\nA '''solar cell''', or '''photovoltaic cell''', is an electrical device that converts the energy of [[light]] directly into [[electricity]] by the [[photovoltaic effect]], which is a [[physics|physical]] and [[Chemical substance|chemical]] phenomenon.<ref name=\"chemistryexplained.com\">[http://www.chemistryexplained.com/Ru-Sp/Solar-Cells.html Solar Cells]. chemistryexplained.com</ref> It is a form of photoelectric cell, defined as a device whose electrical characteristics, such as [[Electric currentr cell devices can be combined to form modules, otherwise known as [[solar panel]]s. The common single junction [[silicon]] solar cell can produce a maximum open-circuit voltage of approximately 0.5 to 0.6 volts.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://solarbotics.net/starting/200202_solar_cells/200202_solar_cell_use.html|title=Solar cells \u2013 performance and use|website=solarbotic s.net}}</ref>\n\nSolar cells are described as being [[Photovoltaics|photovoltaic]], irrespective of whether the source is [[sunlight]] or an artificial light. In addition to producing energy, they can be used as a [[photodetector]] (for example [[infrared detector]]s), detecting light or other [[electromagnetic radiation]] near the visible range, or measuring light intensity.\n\nThe operation of a photovoltaic (PV) cell requires three basic attributes:\n* The absorption of light, generating either [[electron]]-[[Electron hole|hole]] pairs or [[exciton]]s.\n* The separation of [[charge carrier]]s of opposite types.\n* The separate extraction of those carriers to an external circuit.\n\nIn contrast, a [[solar thermal collector]] supplies [[heat]] by [[Absorption (electromagnetic radiation)|absorbing sunlight]], for the purpose of either direct heating or indirect [[electrical power generation]] from heat. A \"photoelectrolytic cell\" ([[photoelectrochemical cell]]), on the other hand, refers either to a type of photovoltaic cell (like that developed by [[Edmond Becquerel]] and modern [[dye-sensitized solar cell]]s), or to a device that [[Water splitting|splits water]] directly into [[hydrogen]] and [[oxygen]] using only solar illumination.\n{{TOC_limit|3}}It is also known as solar cell\n\n== Applications ==\n[[File:From a solar cell to a PV system.svg|thumb|From a solar cell to a PV system. Diagram of the possible components of a [[photovoltaic system]]]]\n\nAssemblies of solar cells are used to make [[Solar panel|solar modules]] that generate electrical power from [[sunlight]], as distinguished from a \"solar thermal module\" or \"solar hot water panel\". A solar array generates [[solar power]] using [[solar energy]].\n\n=== Cells, modules, panels and systems ===\n{{Main|Photovoltaic system}}\nMultiple solar cells in an integrated group, all oriented in one plane, constitute a [[Solar panel|solar photovoltaic panel or module]]. Photovoltaic modules often have a sheet of glass on the sun-facing side, allowing light to pass while protecting the semiconductor [[Wafer (electronics)|wafers]]. Solar cells are usually connected in [[series and parallel circuits]] or series in modules, creating an additive voltage. Connecting cells in parallel yields a higher current; however, problems such as shadow effects can shut down the weaker (less illuminated) parallel string (a number of series connected cells) causing substantial power loss and possible damage because of the reverse bias applied to the shadowed cells by their illuminated partners. Strings of series cells are usually handled independently and not connected in parallel, though as of 2014, individual [[Electric power conversion|power boxes]] are often supplied for each module, and are connected in parallel. Although modules can be interconnected to create an array with the desired peak DC voltage and loading current capacity, using independent MPPTs ([[Maximum power point tracking|maximum power point trackers]]) is preferable. Otherwise, shunt [[diode]]s can reduce shadowing power loss in arrays with series/parallel connected cells.{{citation needed|date=June 2014}}\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center; margin: 4px auto 1px auto;\"\n|+ Typical PV system prices in 2013 in selected countries ($/W)\n|-\n!

For Example, [[Explorer 6]], launched in 1959, had four arrays that folded out once in orbit. They provided power for months in space.]]\nSolar cells were first used in a prominent application when they were proposed and flown on the Vanguard satellite in 1958, as an alternative power source to the [[primary cell|primary battery]] power source. By adding cells to the outside of the body, the mission time could be extended with no major changes to the spacecraft or its power systems. In 1959 the United States launched [[Explorer 6]], featuring large wing-shaped solar arrays, which became a common feature in satellites. These arrays consisted of 9600 [[H. Leslie (Les) Hoffman|Hoffman solar cells]].\n\nBy the 1960s, solar cells were (and still are) the main power source for most Earth orbiting satellites and a number of probes into the solar system, since they offered the best [[power-to-weight ratio]]. However, this success was possible because in the space application, power system costs could be high, because space users had few other power options, and were willing to pay for the best possible cells. The space power market drove the development of higher efficiencies in solar cells up until the [[National Science Foundation]] \"Research Applied to National Needs\" program began to push development of solar cells for terrestrial applications.\n\nIn the early 1990s the technology used for space solar cells diverged from the silicon technology used for terrestrial panels, with the spacecraft application shifting to [[gallium arsenide]]-based III-V semiconductor materials, which then evolved into the modern III-V [[multijunction photovoltaic cell]] used on spacecraft.\n\nIn recent years, research has moved towards designing and manufacturing lightweight, flexible, and highly efficient solar cells. Terrestrial solar cell technology generally uses photovoltaic cells that are laminated with a layer of glass for strength and protection. Space applications for solar cells require that the cells and arrays are both highly efficient and extremely lightweight. Some newer technology implemented on satellites are multi-junction photovoltaic cells, which are composed of different PN junctions with varying bandgaps in order to utilize a wider spectrum of the sun's energy. Additionally, large satellites require the use of large solar arrays to produce electricity. These solar arrays need to be broken down to fit in the geometric constraints of the launch vehicle the satellite travels on before being injected into orbit. Historically, solar cells on satellites consisted of several small terrestrial panels folded together. These small panels would be unfolded into a large panel after the satellite is deployed in its orbit. Newer satellites aim to use flexible rollable solar arrays that are very lightweight and can be packed into a very small volume. The smaller size and weight of these flexible arrays drastically decreases the overall cost of launching a satellite due to the direct relationship between payload weight and launch cost of a launch vehicle.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/station/structure/elements/solar_arrays.html|title=International Space Station Solar Arrays|last=Garcia|first=Mark|date=31 July 2017|website=NASA|access-date=10 May 2019}}</ref>\n\n=== Price reductions ===\nImprovements were gradual over the 1960s. This was also the reason that costs remained high, because space users were willing to pay for the best possible cells, leaving no reason to invest in lower-cost, less-efficient solutions. The price was determined largely by the [[semiconductor industry]]; their move to [[integrated circuit]]s in the 1960s led to the availability of larger [[Boule (crystal)|boules]] at lower relative prices. As their price fell, the price of the resulting cells did as well. These effects lowered 1971 cell costs to some $100 per watt.{{sfn|Perlin|1999|p= 50}}\n\nIn late 1969 Elliot Berman joined [[Exxon]]'s task force which was looking for projects 30 years in the future and in April 1973 he founded Solar Power Corporation, a wholly owned subsidiary of Exxon at that time.{{sfn|Perlin|1999|p=53}}<ref name=\"williams 2005\">\n{{cite book\n | first = Neville | last = Williams\n | title = Chasing the Sun: Solar Adventures Around the World\n | url = https://archive.org/details/chasingsunsolara0000will | url-access = registration | year = 2005\n | publisher = [[New Society Publishers]]\n | page = [https://archive.org/details/chasingsunsolara0000will/page/84 84]\n | isbn = 9781550923124}}\n</ref><ref name=jones>\n{{cite book\n | first1 = Geoffrey | last1 = Jones\n | first2 = Loubna | last2 = Bouamane \n | title = \"Power from Sunshine\": A Business History of Solar Energy\n | url = http://www.hbs.edu/faculty/Publication%20Files/12-105.pdf\n | year = 2012\n | publisher = [[Harvard Business School]]\n | pages = 22\u201323\n }}\n</ref> The group had concluded that electrical power would be much more expensive by 2000, and felt that this increase in price would make alternative energy sources more attractive.

Cell sizes grew as equipment became available on the surplus market; [[ARCO]] Solar's original panels used cells {{convert|2|to|4|in|mm|-1}} in diameter. Panels in the 1990s and early 2000s generally used 125&nbsp;mm wafers; since 2008, almost all new panels use 156&nbsp;mm cells. The widespread introduction of [[flat screen television]]s in the late 1990s and early 2000s led to the wide availability of large, high-quality glass sheets to cover the panels.\n\nDuring the 1990s, [[polysilicon]] (\"poly\") cells became increasingly popular. These cells offer less efficiency than their monosilicon (\"mono\") counterparts, but they are grown in large vats that reduce cost. By the mid-2000s, poly was dominant in the low-cost panel market, but more recently the mono returned to widespread use.\n\nManufacturers of wafer-based cells responded to high silicon prices in 2004\u20132008 with rapid reductions in silicon consumption. In 2008, according to Jef Poortmans, director of [[IMEC]]'s organic and solar department, current cells use {{convert|8|-|9|g|oz}} of silicon per watt of power generation, with wafer thicknesses in the neighborhood of 200&nbsp;[[microns]].

These [[List of semiconductor materials|materials]] must have certain characteristics in order to absorb [[sunlight]]. Some cells are designed to handle sunlight that reaches the Earth's surface, while others are optimized for [[Solar panels on spacecraft|use in space]]. Solar cells can be made of only one single layer of light-absorbing material ([[p-n junction|single-junction]]) or use multiple physical configurations ([[multi-junction]]s) to take advantage of various absorption and charge separation mechanisms.\n\nSolar cells can be classified into first, second and third generation cells. The first generation cells\u2014also called conventional, traditional or [[Wafer (electronics)|wafer]]-based cells\u2014are made of [[crystalline silicon]], the commercially predominant PV technology, that includes materials such as [[polysilicon]] and [[monocrystalline silicon]]. Second generation cells are [[thin film solar cells]], that include [[amorphous silicon]], [[Cadmium telluride photovoltaics|CdTe]] and [[Copper indium gallium selenide solar cell|CIGS]] cells and are commercially significant in utility-scale [[photovoltaic power station]]s, [[building integrated photovoltaics]] or in small [[stand-alone power system]]. The [[third-generation photovoltaic cell|third generation of solar cells]] includes a number of thin-film technologies often described as emerging photovoltaics\u2014most of them have not yet been commercially applied and are still in the research or development phase. Many use organic materials, often [[organometallic]] compounds as well as inorganic substances. Despite the fact that their efficiencies had been low and the stability of the absorber material was often too short for commercial applications, there is a lot of research invested into these technologies as they promise to achieve the goal of producing low-cost, high-efficiency solar cells.\n\n=== Crystalline silicon ===\n{{Main|Crystalline silicon}}\nBy far, the most prevalent bulk material for solar cells is [[crystalline silicon]] (c-Si), also known as \"solar grade silicon\".{{citation needed|date=November 2017}} Bulk silicon is separated into multiple categories according to crystallinity and crystal size in the resulting [[ingot]], [[ribbon]] or [[Wafer (electronics)|wafer]]. These cells are entirely based around the concept of a [[p-n junction]].\nSolar cells made of c-Si are made from [[wafer (electronics)|wafers]] between 160 and 240&nbsp;micrometers thick.\n\n==== Monocrystalline silicon ====\n{{Main|Monocrystalline silicon}}\n[[File:Sono Sion Front Back.jpg|thumb|The roof, bonnet and large parts of the outer shell of the [[Sion (electric car)|Sion]] are equipped with highly efficient monocrystalline silicon cells]]\n\n[[Monocrystalline silicon]] (mono-Si) solar cells are more efficient and more expensive than most other types of cells. The corners of the cells look clipped, like an octagon, because the wafer material is cut from cylindrical ingots, that are typically grown by the [[Czochralski process]]. Solar panels using mono-Si cells display a distinctive pattern of small white diamonds.\n\n====Epitaxial silicon development====\n[[Epitaxial wafer]]s of crystalline silicon can be grown on a monocrystalline silicon \"seed\" wafer by [[chemical vapor deposition]] (CVD), and then detached as self-supporting wafers of some standard thickness (e.g., 250&nbsp;\u00b5m) that can be manipulated by hand, and directly substituted for wafer cells cut from monocrystalline silicon ingots.

Based on the previous literature and some theoretical analysis, there are several reasons why GaAs has such high power conversion efficiency. First, GaAs bandgap is 1.43ev which is almost ideal for solar cells. Second, because Gallium is a by-product of the smelting of other metals, GaAs cells are relatively insensitive to heat and it can keep high efficiency when temperature is quite high. Third, GaAs has the wide range of design options. Using GaAs as active layer in solar cell, engineers can have multiple choices of other layers which can better generate electrons and holes in GaAs.\n\n=== Multijunction cells ===\n{{Main|Multi-junction solar cell}}\n[[File:Dawn solar panel.jpg|thumb|[[Dawn (spacecraft)|Dawn]]'s 10&nbsp;[[Kilowatt|kW]] triple-junction gallium arsenide solar array at full extension]]\n\nMulti-junction cells consist of multiple thin films, each essentially a solar cell grown on top of another, typically using [[metalorganic vapour phase epitaxy]].

It introduces an intermediate band (IB) energy level in between the valence and conduction bands. Theoretically, introducing an IB allows two [[photons]] with energy less than the [[bandgap]] to excite an electron from the [[valence band]] to the [[conduction band]]. This increases the induced photocurrent and thereby efficiency.<ref>{{cite journal|doi=10.1103/PhysRevLett.78.5014|title=Increasing the Efficiency of Ideal Solar Cells by Photon Induced Transitions at Intermediate Levels|journal=Physical Review Letters|volume=78|issue=26|pages=5014\u20135017|year=1997|last1=Luque|first1=Antonio|last2=Mart\u00ed|first2=Antonio|bibcode=1997PhRvL..78.5014L}}</ref>\n\n[[Antonio Luque L\u00f3pez|Luque]] and Marti first derived a theoretical limit for an IB device with one midgap energy level using [[detailed balance]].

Either of these techniques could be used to produce higher efficiency solar cells by allowing solar photons to be more efficiently used. The difficulty, however, is that the conversion efficiency of existing [[phosphor]]s exhibiting up- or down-conversion is low, and is typically narrow band.\n\nOne upconversion technique is to incorporate [[lanthanide]]-doped materials ([[Erbium|{{chem|Er|3+}}]], [[Ytterbium|{{chem|Yb|3+}}]], [[Holmium|{{chem|Ho|3+}}]] or a combination), taking advantage of their [[luminescence]] to convert [[infrared radiation]] to visible light. Upconversion process occurs when two [[infrared]] photons are absorbed by [[rare-earth]] [[ion]]s to generate a (high-energy) absorbable photon. As example, the energy transfer upconversion process (ETU), consists in successive transfer processes between excited ions in the near infrared. The upconverter material could be placed below the solar cell to absorb the infrared light that passes through the silicon. Useful ions are most commonly found in the trivalent state. {{chem|Er|+}} ions have been the most used. {{chem|Er|3+}} ions absorb solar radiation around 1.54&nbsp;\u00b5m. Two {{chem|Er|3+}} ions that have absorbed this radiation can interact with each other through an upconversion process. The excited ion emits light above the Si bandgap that is absorbed by the solar cell and creates an additional electron\u2013hole pair that can generate current. However, the increased efficiency was small. In addition, fluoroindate glasses have low [[phonon]] energy and have been proposed as suitable matrix doped with {{chem|Ho|3+}} ions.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Hern\u00e1ndez-Rodr\u00edguez|first=M.A.|author2=Imanieh, M.H. |author3=Mart\u00edn, L.L. |author4= Mart\u00edn, I.R. |title=Experimental enhancement of the photocurrent in a solar cell using upconversion process in fluoroindate glasses exciting at 1480nm|journal=Solar Energy Materials and Solar Cells|date=September 2013|volume=116|pages=171\u2013175|doi=10.1016/j.solmat.2013.04.023}}</ref>\n\n=== Light-absorbing dyes ===\n{{Main|Dye-sensitized solar cell|l1=Dye-sensitized solar cells}}\n[[Dye-sensitized solar cell]]s (DSSCs) are made of low-cost materials and do not need elaborate manufacturing equipment, so they can be made in a [[Do it yourself|DIY]] fashion. In bulk it should be significantly less expensive than older [[Solid state (electronics)|solid-state]] cell designs. DSSC's can be engineered into flexible sheets and although its [[conversion efficiency]] is less than the best [[thin film cell]]s, its [[price/performance ratio]] may be high enough to allow them to compete with [[fossil fuel electrical generation]].\n\nTypically a [[ruthenium]] [[Metalorganics|metalorganic]] [[dye]] (Ru-centered) is used as a [[monolayer]] of light-absorbing material. The dye-sensitized solar cell depends on a [[mesoporous]] layer of [[nanoparticulate]] [[titanium dioxide]] to greatly amplify the surface area (200\u2013300 m<sup>2</sup>/g {{chem|TiO|2}}, as compared to approximately 10 m<sup>2</sup>/g of flat single crystal). The photogenerated electrons from the light absorbing dye are passed on to the n-type {{chem|TiO|2}} and the holes are absorbed by an [[electrolyte]] on the other side of the dye. The circuit is completed by a [[redox]] couple in the electrolyte, which can be liquid or solid. This type of cell allows more flexible use of materials and is typically manufactured by [[screen printing]] or [[ultrasonic nozzle]]s, with the potential for lower processing costs than those used for bulk solar cells. However, the dyes in these cells also suffer from [[chemical decomposition|degradation]] under heat and [[UV]] light and the cell casing is difficult to [[Seal (mechanical)|seal]] due to the solvents used in assembly.

In addition, these cells could be beneficial for some applications where mechanical flexibility and disposability are important. Current cell efficiencies are, however, very low, and practical devices are essentially non-existent.\n\nEnergy conversion efficiencies achieved to date using conductive polymers are very low compared to inorganic materials. However, [[Konarka]] Power Plastic reached efficiency of 8.3%<ref>[http://www.pv-tech.org/news/nrel_validates_konarkas_8.3_power_plastic_efficiency_record Konarka Power Plastic reaches 8.3% efficiency]. pv-tech.org.

When a photon is converted into an electron hole pair, typically in the donor material, the charges tend to remain bound in the form of an [[exciton]], separating when the exciton diffuses to the donor-acceptor interface, unlike most other solar cell types. The short exciton diffusion lengths of most polymer systems tend to limit the efficiency of such devices. Nanostructured interfaces, sometimes in the form of bulk heterojunctions, can improve performance.<ref>{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1016/S1369-7021(07)70276-6| title = Polymer-based solar cells| journal = Materials Today| volume = 10| issue = 11| page = 28| year = 2007| last1 = Mayer | first1 = A. | last2 = Scully | first2 = S. | last3 = Hardin | first3 = B. | last4 = Rowell | first4 = M. | last5 = McGehee | first5 = M. }}</ref>\n\nIn 2011, MIT and Michigan State researchers developed solar cells with a power efficiency close to 2% with a transparency to the human eye greater than 65%, achieved by selectively absorbing the ultraviolet and near-infrared parts of the spectrum with small-molecule compounds.<ref>{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1063/1.3567516| title = Transparent, near-infrared organic photovoltaic solar cells for window and energy-scavenging applications| journal = Applied Physics Letters| volume = 98| issue = 11| page = 113305| year = 2011| last1 = Lunt | first1 = R.

An adaptive material responds to the intensity and angle of incident light. At the part of the cell where the light is most intense, the cell surface changes from reflective to adaptive, allowing the light to penetrate the cell. The other parts of the cell remain reflective increasing the retention of the absorbed light within the cell.<ref name=tr1407>Bullis, Kevin (30 July 2014) [http://www.technologyreview.com/news/529476/adaptive-material-could-cut-the-cost-of-solar-in-half Adaptive Material Could Cut the Cost of Solar in Half]. ''MIT Technology Review''</ref>\n\nIn 2014, a system was developed that combined an adaptive surface with a glass substrate that redirect the absorbed to a light absorber on the edges of the sheet. The system also includes an array of fixed lenses/mirrors to concentrate light onto the adaptive surface. As the day continues, the concentrated light moves along the surface of the cell. That surface switches from reflective to adaptive when the light is most concentrated and back to reflective after the light moves along.<ref name=tr1407/>\n\n=== Surface texturing ===\n[[File:SolarImpulse HB-SIA landing Brussels Airport 3-crop.jpg|thumb|right|250px|[[Solar Impulse]] aircraft are Swiss-designed single-seat monoplanes powered entirely from photovoltaic cells]]\n\nFor the past years, researchers have been trying to reduce the price of solar cells while maximizing efficiency. [[Thin-film solar cell]] is a cost-effective second generation solar cell with much reduced thickness at the expense of light absorption efficiency. Efforts to maximize light absorption efficiency with reduced thickness have been made. Surface texturing is one of techniques used to reduce optical losses to maximize light absorbed. Currently, surface texturing techniques on silicon photovoltaics are drawing much attention. Surface texturing could be done in multiple ways. Etching single crystalline silicon substrate can produce randomly distributed square based pyramids on the surface using anisotropic etchants.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Campbell|first=Patrick|author2=Green, Martin A. |title=Light Trapping Properties of Pyramidally textured surfaces|journal=Journal of Applied Physics|date=Feb 1987|volume=62|issue=1| pages=243\u2013249|doi=10.1063/1.339189|bibcode=1987JAP....62..243C}}</ref> Recent studies show that c-Si wafers could be etched down to form nano-scale inverted pyramids. Multicrystalline silicon solar cells, due to poorer crystallographic quality, are less effective than single crystal solar cells, but mc-Si solar cells are still being used widely due to less manufacturing difficulties. It is reported that multicrystalline solar cells can be surface-textured to yield solar energy conversion efficiency comparable to that of monocrystalline silicon cells, through isotropic etching or photolithography techniques.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Zhao|first=Jianhua|author2=Wang, Aihua |author3=Green, Martin A.|title=19.8% efficient \"honeycomb\" textured multicrystalline and 24.4% monocrystalline silicon solar cells|journal=Applied Physics Letters|date=May 1998|volume=73|issue=14| pages=1991\u20131993|doi=10.1063/1.122345|bibcode=1998ApPhL..73.1991Z}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last=Hauser|first=H.|author2=Michl, B.|author3=Kubler, V.|author4= Schwarzkopf, S.|author5= Muller, C.|author6= Hermle, M.|author7= Blasi, B.|title=Nanoimprint Lithography for Honeycomb Texturing of Multicrystalline Silicon|journal=Energy Procedia|date=2011|volume=8|pages=648\u2013653|doi=10.1016/j.egypro.2011.06.196}}</ref> Incident light rays onto a textured surface do not reflect back out to the air as opposed to rays onto a flat surface. Rather some light rays are bounced back onto the other surface again due to the geometry of the surface. This process significantly improves light to electricity conversion efficiency, due to increased light absorption. This texture effect as well as the interaction with other interfaces in the PV module is a challenging optical simulation task. A particularly efficient method for modeling and optimization is the [[OPTOS formalism]].<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Tucher|first=Nico|last2=Eisenlohr|first2=Johannes|last3=Gebrewold|first3=Habtamu|last4=Kiefel|first4=Peter|last5=H\u00f6hn|first5=Oliver|last6=Hauser|first6=Hubert|last7=Goldschmidt|first7=Jan Christoph|last8=Bl\u00e4si|first8=Benedikt|date=11 July 2016|title=Optical simulation of photovoltaic modules with multiple textured interfaces using the matrix-based formalism OPTOS|journal=Optics Express|volume=24|issue=14|pages=A1083\u2013A1093|doi=10.1364/OE.24.0A1083|pmid=27410896|bibcode=2016OExpr..24A1083T}}</ref> In 2012, researchers at MIT reported that c-Si films textured with nanoscale inverted pyramids could achieve light absorption comparable to 30 times thicker planar c-Si.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Mavrokefalos|first=Anastassios|author2=Han, Sang Eon. |author3=Yerci, Selcuk |author4= Branham, M.S.|author5= Chen, Gang. |title=Efficient Light Trapping in Inverted Nanopyramid Thin Crystalline Silicon Membranes for Solar Cell Applications|journal=Nano Letters|date=June 2012|volume=12|issue=6| pages=2792\u20132796|doi=10.1021/nl2045777|bibcode=2012NanoL..12.2792M |pmid=22612694|hdl=1721.1/86899}}</ref> In combination with [[anti-reflective coating]], surface texturing technique can effectively trap light rays within a thin film silicon solar cell.

The encapsulants are commonly made from [[polyvinyl acetate]] or glass. Most encapsulants are uniform in structure and composition, which increases light collection owing to light trapping from total internal reflection of light within the resin. Research has been conducted into structuring the encapsulant to provide further collection of light.

However, the strict requirements for cleanliness and quality control of semiconductor fabrication are more relaxed for solar cells, lowering costs.\n\n[[Polycrystalline silicon]] wafers are made by wire-sawing block-cast silicon ingots into 180 to 350 micrometer wafers. The wafers are usually lightly [[p-type semiconductor|p-type]]-doped. A surface diffusion of [[n-type semiconductor|n-type]] dopants is performed on the front side of the wafer. This forms a p\u2013n junction a few hundred nanometers below the surface.\n\n[[Anti-reflective coating|Anti-reflection coatings]] are then typically applied to increase the amount of light coupled into the solar cell. [[Silicon nitride]] has gradually replaced titanium dioxide as the preferred material, because of its excellent surface passivation qualities. It prevents carrier recombination at the cell surface. A layer several hundred nanometers thick is applied using PECVD. Some solar cells have textured front surfaces that, like anti-reflection coatings, increase the amount of light reaching the wafer. Such surfaces were first applied to single-crystal silicon, followed by multicrystalline silicon somewhat later.\n\nA full area metal contact is made on the back surface, and a grid-like metal contact made up of fine \"fingers\" and larger \"bus bars\" are screen-printed onto the front surface using a [[silver]] paste. This is an evolution of the so-called \"wet\" process for applying electrodes, first described in a US patent filed in 1981 by [[Bayer AG]].<ref>Fitzky, Hans G. and Ebneth, Harold (24 May 1983) {{US patent|4385102}}, \"Large-area photovoltaic cell\"</ref> The rear contact is formed by screen-printing a metal paste, typically aluminium. Usually this contact covers the entire rear, though some designs employ a grid pattern. The paste is then fired at several hundred degrees Celsius to form metal electrodes in [[ohmic contact]] with the silicon. Some companies use an additional electro-plating step to increase efficiency. After the metal contacts are made, the solar cells are interconnected by flat wires or metal ribbons, and assembled into [[photovoltaic module|modules]] or \"solar panels\". Solar panels have a sheet of [[tempered glass]] on the front, and a [[polymer]] encapsulation on the back.\n\n== Manufacturers and certification ==\n{{Further|List of photovoltaics companies}}\n[[File:SolarCellProduction-E.PNG|thumb|right|190px|Solar cell production by region<ref name=\"pvnews\">[http://www.greentechmedia.com/research/report/pv-news Pv News November 2012].

Individual solar cell devices can be combined to form modules, otherwise known as [[solar panel]]s. The common single junction [[silicon]] solar cell can produce a maximum open-circuit voltage of approximately 0.5 to 0.6 volts.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://solarbotics.net/starting/200202_solar_cells/200202_solar_cell_use.html|title=Solar cells \u2013 performance and use|website=solarbotic s.net}}</ref>\n\nSolar cells are described as being [[Photovoltaics|photovoltaic]], irrespective of whether the source is [[sunlight]] or an artificial light. In addition to producing energy, they can be used as a [[photodetector]] (for example [[infrared detector]]s), detecting light or other [[electromagnetic radiation]] near the visible range, or measuring light intensity.\n\nThe operation of a photovoltaic (PV) cell requires three basic attributes:\n* The absorption of light, generating either [[electron]]-[[Electron hole|hole]] pairs or [[exciton]]s.\n* The separation of [[charge carrier]]s of opposite types.\n* The separate extraction of those carriers to an external circuit.\n\nIn contrast, a [[solar thermal collector]] supplies [[heat]] by [[Absorption (electromagnetic radiation)|absorbing sunlight]], for the purpose of either direct heating or indirect [[electrical power generation]] from heat. A \"photoelectrolytic cell\" ([[photoelectrochemical cell]]), on the other hand, refers either to a type of photovoltaic cell (like that developed by [[Edmond Becquerel]] and modern [[dye-sensitized solar cell]]s), or to a device that [[Water splitting|splits water]] directly into [[hydrogen]] and [[oxygen]] using only solar illumination.\n{{TOC_limit|3}}\n\n== Applications ==\n[[File:From a solar cell to a PV system.svg|thumb|From a solar cell to a PV system. Diagram of the possible components of a [[photovoltaic system]]]]\n\nAssemblies of solar cells are used to make [[Solar panel|solar modules]] that generate electrical power from [[sunlight]], as distinguished from a \"solar thermal module\" or \"solar hot water panel\". A solar array generates [[solar power]] using [[solar energy]].\n\n=== Cells, modules, panels and systems ===\n{{Main|Photovoltaic system}}\nMultiple solar cells in an integrated group, all oriented in one plane, constitute a [[Solar panel|solar photovoltaic panel or module]]. Photovoltaic modules often have a sheet of glass on the sun-facing side, allowing light to pass while protecting the semiconductor [[Wafer (electronics)|wafers]]. Solar cells are usually connected in [[series and parallel circuits]] or series in modules, creating an additive voltage. Connecting cells in parallel yields a higher current; however, problems such as shadow effects can shut down the weaker (less illuminated) parallel string (a number of series connected cells) causing substantial power loss and possible damage because of the reverse bias applied to the shadowed cells by their illuminated partners. Strings of series cells are usually handled independently and not connected in parallel, though as of 2014, individual [[Electric power conversion|power boxes]] are often supplied for each module, and are connected in parallel. Although modules can be interconnected to create an array with the desired peak DC voltage and loading current capacity, using independent MPPTs ([[Maximum power point tracking|maximum power point trackers]]) is preferable. Otherwise, shunt [[diode]]s can reduce shadowing power loss in arrays with series/parallel connected cells.{{citation needed|date=June 2014}}\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center; margin: 4px auto 1px auto;\"\n|+ Typical PV system prices in 2013 in selected countries ($/W)\n|-\n!

For Example, [[Explorer 6]], launched in 1959, had four arrays that folded out once in orbit. They provided power for months in space.]]\nSolar cells were first used in a prominent application when they were proposed and flown on the Vanguard satellite in 1958, as an alternative power source to the [[primary cell|primary battery]] power source. By adding cells to the outside of the body, the mission time could be extended with no major changes to the spacecraft or its power systems. In 1959 the United States launched [[Explorer 6]], featuring large wing-shaped solar arrays, which became a common feature in satellites. These arrays consisted of 9600 [[H. Leslie (Les) Hoffman|Hoffman solar cells]].\n\nBy the 1960s, solar cells were (and still are) the main power source for most Earth orbiting satellites and a number of probes into the solar system, since they offered the best [[power-to-weight ratio]]. However, this success was possible because in the space application, power system costs could be high, because space users had few other power options, and were willing to pay for the best possible cells. The space power market drove the development of higher efficiencies in solar cells up until the [[National Science Foundation]] \"Research Applied to National Needs\" program began to push development of solar cells for terrestrial applications.\n\nIn the early 1990s the technology used for space solar cells diverged from the silicon technology used for terrestrial panels, with the spacecraft application shifting to [[gallium arsenide]]-based III-V semiconductor materials, which then evolved into the modern III-V [[multijunction photovoltaic cell]] used on spacecraft.\n\nIn recent years, research has moved towards designing and manufacturing lightweight, flexible, and highly efficient solar cells. Terrestrial solar cell technology generally uses photovoltaic cells that are laminated with a layer of glass for strength and protection. Space applications for solar cells require that the cells and arrays are both highly efficient and extremely lightweight. Some newer technology implemented on satellites are multi-junction photovoltaic cells, which are composed of different PN junctions with varying bandgaps in order to utilize a wider spectrum of the sun's energy. Additionally, large satellites require the use of large solar arrays to produce electricity. These solar arrays need to be broken down to fit in the geometric constraints of the launch vehicle the satellite travels on before being injected into orbit. Historically, solar cells on satellites consisted of several small terrestrial panels folded together. These small panels would be unfolded into a large panel after the satellite is deployed in its orbit. Newer satellites aim to use flexible rollable solar arrays that are very lightweight and can be packed into a very small volume. The smaller size and weight of these flexible arrays drastically decreases the overall cost of launching a satellite due to the direct relationship between payload weight and launch cost of a launch vehicle.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/station/structure/elements/solar_arrays.html|title=International Space Station Solar Arrays|last=Garcia|first=Mark|date=31 July 2017|website=NASA|access-date=10 May 2019}}</ref>\n\n=== Price reductions ===\nImprovements were gradual over the 1960s. This was also the reason that costs remained high, because space users were willing to pay for the best possible cells, leaving no reason to invest in lower-cost, less-efficient solutions. The price was determined largely by the [[semiconductor industry]]; their move to [[integrated circuit]]s in the 1960s led to the availability of larger [[Boule (crystal)|boules]] at lower relative prices. As their price fell, the price of the resulting cells did as well. These effects lowered 1971 cell costs to some $100 per watt.{{sfn|Perlin|1999|p= 50}}\n\nIn late 1969 Elliot Berman joined [[Exxon]]'s task force which was looking for projects 30 years in the future and in April 1973 he founded Solar Power Corporation, a wholly owned subsidiary of Exxon at that time.{{sfn|Perlin|1999|p=53}}<ref name=\"williams 2005\">\n{{cite book\n | first = Neville | last = Williams\n | title = Chasing the Sun: Solar Adventures Around the World\n | url = https://archive.org/details/chasingsunsolara0000will | url-access = registration | year = 2005\n | publisher = [[New Society Publishers]]\n | page = [https://archive.org/details/chasingsunsolara0000will/page/84 84]\n | isbn = 9781550923124}}\n</ref><ref name=jones>\n{{cite book\n | first1 = Geoffrey | last1 = Jones\n | first2 = Loubna | last2 = Bouamane \n | title = \"Power from Sunshine\": A Business History of Solar Energy\n | url = http://www.hbs.edu/faculty/Publication%20Files/12-105.pdf\n | year = 2012\n | publisher = [[Harvard Business School]]\n | pages = 22\u201323\n }}\n</ref> The group had concluded that electrical power would be much more expensive by 2000, and felt that this increase in price would make alternative energy sources more attractive.

Panels in the 1990s and early 2000s generally used 125&nbsp;mm wafers; since 2008, almost all new panels use 156&nbsp;mm cells.

The first generation cells\u2014also called conventional, traditional or [[Wafer (electronics)|wafer]]-based cells\u2014are made of [[crystalline silicon]], the commercially predominant PV technology, that includes materials such as [[polysilicon]] and [[monocrystalline silicon]]. Second generation cells are [[thin film solar cells]], that include [[amorphous silicon]], [[Cadmium telluride photovoltaics|CdTe]] and [[Copper indium gallium selenide solar cell|CIGS]] cells and are commercially significant in utility-scale [[photovoltaic power station]]s, [[building integrated photovoltaics]] or in small [[stand-alone power system]]. The [[third-generation photovoltaic cell|third generation of solar cells]] includes a number of thin-film technologies often described as emerging photovoltaics\u2014most of them have not yet been commercially applied and are still in the research or development phase. Many use organic materials, often [[organometallic]] compounds as well as inorganic substances. Despite the fact that their efficiencies had been low and the stability of the absorber material was often too short for commercial applications, there is a lot of research invested into these technologies as they promise to achieve the goal of producing low-cost, high-efficiency solar cells.\n\n=== Crystalline silicon ===\n{{Main|Crystalline silicon}}\nBy far, the most prevalent bulk material for solar cells is [[crystalline silicon]] (c-Si), also known as \"solar grade silicon\".{{citation needed|date=November 2017}} Bulk silicon is separated into multiple categories according to crystallinity and crystal size in the resulting [[ingot]], [[ribbon]] or [[Wafer (electronics)|wafer]]. These cells are entirely based around the concept of a [[p-n junction]].\nSolar cells made of c-Si are made from [[wafer (electronics)|wafers]] between 160 and 240&nbsp;micrometers thick.\n\n==== Monocrystalline silicon ====\n{{Main|Monocrystalline silicon}}\n[[File:Sono Sion Front Back.jpg|thumb|The roof, bonnet and large parts of the outer shell of the [[Sion (electric car)|Sion]] are equipped with highly efficient monocrystalline silicon cells]]\n\n[[Monocrystalline silicon]] (mono-Si) solar cells are more efficient and more expensive than most other types of cells. The corners of the cells look clipped, like an octagon, because the wafer material is cut from cylindrical ingots, that are typically grown by the [[Czochralski process]]. Solar panels using mono-Si cells display a distinctive pattern of small white diamonds.\n\n====Epitaxial silicon development====\n[[Epitaxial wafer]]s of crystalline silicon can be grown on a monocrystalline silicon \"seed\" wafer by [[chemical vapor deposition]] (CVD), and then detached as self-supporting wafers of some standard thickness (e.g., 250&nbsp;\u00b5m) that can be manipulated by hand, and directly substituted for wafer cells cut from monocrystalline silicon ingots. Solar cells made with this \"[[Saw#Terminology|kerf]]less\" technique can have efficiencies approaching those of wafer-cut cells, but at appreciably lower cost if the CVD can be done at [[atmospheric pressure]] in a high-throughput inline process.<ref name=NexWafe/><ref name=\"Drie\u00dfenAmiri2016\"/> The surface of epitaxial wafers may be textured to enhance light absorption.<ref name=pyramid>{{cite journal| doi=10.1021/acs.nanolett.6b01240 | pmid=27525513 | title=Ultrathin Epitaxial Silicon Solar Cells with Inverted Nanopyramid Arrays for Efficient Light Trapping | first1= Alexandre| last1= Gaucher| first2= Andrea| last2= Cattoni| first3= Christophe| last3= Dupuis| first4= Wanghua| last4= Chen| first5= Romain| last5= Cariou|last6 = Foldyna| first6=Martin | last7=Lalouat | first7=Lo\u0131\u0308c | last8=Drouard | first8=Emmanuel | last9=Seassal | first9=Christian | last10=Roca i Cabarrocas | first10=Pere | last11=Collin | first11=St\u00e9phane | journal= Nano Letters| year= 2016| volume= 16| issue=9 | pages= 5358\u201364| bibcode=2016NanoL..16.5358G }}</ref><ref name=\"ChenCariou2016\">{{cite journal | last1=Chen | first1=Wanghua | last2=Cariou | first2=Romain | last3=Foldyna | first3=Martin | last4=Depauw | first4=Valerie | last5=Trompoukis | first5=Christos | last6=Drouard | first6=Emmanuel | last7=Lalouat | first7=Loic | last8=Harouri | first8=Abdelmounaim | last9=Liu | first9=Jia | last10=Fave | first10=Alain | last11=Orobtchouk | first11=R\u00e9gis | last12=Mandorlo | first12=Fabien | last13=Seassal | first13=Christian | last14=Massiot | first14=In\u00e8s | last15=Dmitriev | first15=Alexandre | last16=Lee | first16=Ki-Dong | last17=Cabarrocas | first17=Pere Roca i | title=Nanophotonics-based low-temperature PECVD epitaxial crystalline silicon solar cells | journal=Journal of Physics D: Applied Physics | volume=49 | issue=12 | year=2016 | pages=125603 | issn=0022-3727 | doi=10.1088/0022-3727/49/12/125603| bibcode=2016JPhD...49l5603C }}</ref>\n\nIn June 2015, it was reported that [[heterojunction]] solar cells grown epitaxially on n-type monocrystalline silicon wafers had reached an efficiency of 22.5% over a total cell area of 243.4&nbsp;cm<math>^2</math>.<ref name=\"KobayashiWatabe2015\">{{cite journal|last1=Kobayashi|first1=Eiji|last2=Watabe|first2=Yoshimi|last3=Hao|first3=Ruiying|last4=Ravi|first4=T.

Based on the previous literature and some theoretical analysis, there are several reasons why GaAs has such high power conversion efficiency. First, GaAs bandgap is 1.43ev which is almost ideal for solar cells. Second, because Gallium is a by-product of the smelting of other metals, GaAs cells are relatively insensitive to heat and it can keep high efficiency when temperature is quite high. Third, GaAs has the wide range of design options. Using GaAs as active layer in solar cell, engineers can have multiple choices of other layers which can better generate electrons and holes in GaAs.\n\n=== Multijunction cells ===\n{{Main|Multi-junction solar cell}}\n[[File:Dawn solar panel.jpg|thumb|[[Dawn (spacecraft)|Dawn]]'s 10&nbsp;[[Kilowatt|kW]] triple-junction gallium arsenide solar array at full extension]]\n\nMulti-junction cells consist of multiple thin films, each essentially a solar cell grown on top of another, typically using [[metalorganic vapour phase epitaxy]].

It introduces an intermediate band (IB) energy level in between the valence and conduction bands. Theoretically, introducing an IB allows two [[photons]] with energy less than the [[bandgap]] to excite an electron from the [[valence band]] to the [[conduction band]]. This increases the induced photocurrent and thereby efficiency.<ref>{{cite journal|doi=10.1103/PhysRevLett.78.5014|title=Increasing the Efficiency of Ideal Solar Cells by Photon Induced Transitions at Intermediate Levels|journal=Physical Review Letters|volume=78|issue=26|pages=5014\u20135017|year=1997|last1=Luque|first1=Antonio|last2=Mart\u00ed|first2=Antonio|bibcode=1997PhRvL..78.5014L}}</ref>\n\n[[Antonio Luque L\u00f3pez|Luque]] and Marti first derived a theoretical limit for an IB device with one midgap energy level using [[detailed balance]].

Either of these techniques could be used to produce higher efficiency solar cells by allowing solar photons to be more efficiently used. The difficulty, however, is that the conversion efficiency of existing [[phosphor]]s exhibiting up- or down-conversion is low, and is typically narrow band.\n\nOne upconversion technique is to incorporate [[lanthanide]]-doped materials ([[Erbium|{{chem|Er|3+}}]], [[Ytterbium|{{chem|Yb|3+}}]], [[Holmium|{{chem|Ho|3+}}]] or a combination), taking advantage of their [[luminescence]] to convert [[infrared radiation]] to visible light. Upconversion process occurs when two [[infrared]] photons are absorbed by [[rare-earth]] [[ion]]s to generate a (high-energy) absorbable photon. As example, the energy transfer upconversion process (ETU), consists in successive transfer processes between excited ions in the near infrared. The upconverter material could be placed below the solar cell to absorb the infrared light that passes through the silicon. Useful ions are most commonly found in the trivalent state. {{chem|Er|+}} ions have been the most used. {{chem|Er|3+}} ions absorb solar radiation around 1.54&nbsp;\u00b5m. Two {{chem|Er|3+}} ions that have absorbed this radiation can interact with each other through an upconversion process. The excited ion emits light above the Si bandgap that is absorbed by the solar cell and creates an additional electron\u2013hole pair that can generate current. However, the increased efficiency was small. In addition, fluoroindate glasses have low [[phonon]] energy and have been proposed as suitable matrix doped with {{chem|Ho|3+}} ions.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Hern\u00e1ndez-Rodr\u00edguez|first=M.A.|author2=Imanieh, M.H. |author3=Mart\u00edn, L.L. |author4= Mart\u00edn, I.R. |title=Experimental enhancement of the photocurrent in a solar cell using upconversion process in fluoroindate glasses exciting at 1480nm|journal=Solar Energy Materials and Solar Cells|date=September 2013|volume=116|pages=171\u2013175|doi=10.1016/j.solmat.2013.04.023}}</ref>\n\n=== Light-absorbing dyes ===\n{{Main|Dye-sensitized solar cell|l1=Dye-sensitized solar cells}}\n[[Dye-sensitized solar cell]]s (DSSCs) are made of low-cost materials and do not need elaborate manufacturing equipment, so they can be made in a [[Do it yourself|DIY]] fashion. In bulk it should be significantly less expensive than older [[Solid state (electronics)|solid-state]] cell designs. DSSC's can be engineered into flexible sheets and although its [[conversion efficiency]] is less than the best [[thin film cell]]s, its [[price/performance ratio]] may be high enough to allow them to compete with [[fossil fuel electrical generation]].\n\nTypically a [[ruthenium]] [[Metalorganics|metalorganic]] [[dye]] (Ru-centered) is used as a [[monolayer]] of light-absorbing material. The dye-sensitized solar cell depends on a [[mesoporous]] layer of [[nanoparticulate]] [[titanium dioxide]] to greatly amplify the surface area (200\u2013300 m<sup>2</sup>/g {{chem|TiO|2}}, as compared to approximately 10 m<sup>2</sup>/g of flat single crystal). The photogenerated electrons from the light absorbing dye are passed on to the n-type {{chem|TiO|2}} and the holes are absorbed by an [[electrolyte]] on the other side of the dye. The circuit is completed by a [[redox]] couple in the electrolyte, which can be liquid or solid. This type of cell allows more flexible use of materials and is typically manufactured by [[screen printing]] or [[ultrasonic nozzle]]s, with the potential for lower processing costs than those used for bulk solar cells. However, the dyes in these cells also suffer from [[chemical decomposition|degradation]] under heat and [[UV]] light and the cell casing is difficult to [[Seal (mechanical)|seal]] due to the solvents used in assembly.

Efforts to maximize light absorption efficiency with reduced thickness have been made. Surface texturing is one of techniques used to reduce optical losses to maximize light absorbed. Currently, surface texturing techniques on silicon photovoltaics are drawing much attention. Surface texturing could be done in multiple ways. Etching single crystalline silicon substrate can produce randomly distributed square based pyramids on the surface using anisotropic etchants.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Campbell|first=Patrick|author2=Green, Martin A. |title=Light Trapping Properties of Pyramidally textured surfaces|journal=Journal of Applied Physics|date=Feb 1987|volume=62|issue=1| pages=243\u2013249|doi=10.1063/1.339189|bibcode=1987JAP....62..243C}}</ref> Recent studies show that c-Si wafers could be etched down to form nano-scale inverted pyramids. Multicrystalline silicon solar cells, due to poorer crystallographic quality, are less effective than single crystal solar cells, but mc-Si solar cells are still being used widely due to less manufacturing difficulties. It is reported that multicrystalline solar cells can be surface-textured to yield solar energy conversion efficiency comparable to that of monocrystalline silicon cells, through isotropic etching or photolithography techniques.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Zhao|first=Jianhua|author2=Wang, Aihua |author3=Green, Martin A.|title=19.8% efficient \"honeycomb\" textured multicrystalline and 24.4% monocrystalline silicon solar cells|journal=Applied Physics Letters|date=May 1998|volume=73|issue=14| pages=1991\u20131993|doi=10.1063/1.122345|bibcode=1998ApPhL..73.1991Z}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last=Hauser|first=H.|author2=Michl, B.|author3=Kubler, V.|author4= Schwarzkopf, S.|author5= Muller, C.|author6= Hermle, M.|author7= Blasi, B.|title=Nanoimprint Lithography for Honeycomb Texturing of Multicrystalline Silicon|journal=Energy Procedia|date=2011|volume=8|pages=648\u2013653|doi=10.1016/j.egypro.2011.06.196}}</ref> Incident light rays onto a textured surface do not reflect back out to the air as opposed to rays onto a flat surface. Rather some light rays are bounced back onto the other surface again due to the geometry of the surface. This process significantly improves light to electricity conversion efficiency, due to increased light absorption. This texture effect as well as the interaction with other interfaces in the PV module is a challenging optical simulation task. A particularly efficient method for modeling and optimization is the [[OPTOS formalism]].<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Tucher|first=Nico|last2=Eisenlohr|first2=Johannes|last3=Gebrewold|first3=Habtamu|last4=Kiefel|first4=Peter|last5=H\u00f6hn|first5=Oliver|last6=Hauser|first6=Hubert|last7=Goldschmidt|first7=Jan Christoph|last8=Bl\u00e4si|first8=Benedikt|date=11 July 2016|title=Optical simulation of photovoltaic modules with multiple textured interfaces using the matrix-based formalism OPTOS|journal=Optics Express|volume=24|issue=14|pages=A1083\u2013A1093|doi=10.1364/OE.24.0A1083|pmid=27410896|bibcode=2016OExpr..24A1083T}}</ref> In 2012, researchers at MIT reported that c-Si films textured with nanoscale inverted pyramids could achieve light absorption comparable to 30 times thicker planar c-Si.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Mavrokefalos|first=Anastassios|author2=Han, Sang Eon. |author3=Yerci, Selcuk |author4= Branham, M.S.|author5= Chen, Gang. |title=Efficient Light Trapping in Inverted Nanopyramid Thin Crystalline Silicon Membranes for Solar Cell Applications|journal=Nano Letters|date=June 2012|volume=12|issue=6| pages=2792\u20132796|doi=10.1021/nl2045777|bibcode=2012NanoL..12.2792M |pmid=22612694|hdl=1721.1/86899}}</ref> In combination with [[anti-reflective coating]], surface texturing technique can effectively trap light rays within a thin film silicon solar cell.

The encapsulants are commonly made from [[polyvinyl acetate]] or glass. Most encapsulants are uniform in structure and composition, which increases light collection owing to light trapping from total internal reflection of light within the resin. Research has been conducted into structuring the encapsulant to provide further collection of light.

However, the strict requirements for cleanliness and quality control of semiconductor fabrication are more relaxed for solar cells, lowering costs.\n\n[[Polycrystalline silicon]] wafers are made by wire-sawing block-cast silicon ingots into 180 to 350 micrometer wafers. The wafers are usually lightly [[p-type semiconductor|p-type]]-doped. A surface diffusion of [[n-type semiconductor|n-type]] dopants is performed on the front side of the wafer. This forms a p\u2013n junction a few hundred nanometers below the surface.\n\n[[Anti-reflective coating|Anti-reflection coatings]] are then typically applied to increase the amount of light coupled into the solar cell. [[Silicon nitride]] has gradually replaced titanium dioxide as the preferred material, because of its excellent surface passivation qualities. It prevents carrier recombination at the cell surface. A layer several hundred nanometers thick is applied using PECVD. Some solar cells have textured front surfaces that, like anti-reflection coatings, increase the amount of light reaching the wafer. Such surfaces were first applied to single-crystal silicon, followed by multicrystalline silicon somewhat later.\n\nA full area metal contact is made on the back surface, and a grid-like metal contact made up of fine \"fingers\" and larger \"bus bars\" are screen-printed onto the front surface using a [[silver]] paste. This is an evolution of the so-called \"wet\" process for applying electrodes, first described in a US patent filed in 1981 by [[Bayer AG]].<ref>Fitzky, Hans G. and Ebneth, Harold (24 May 1983) {{US patent|4385102}}, \"Large-area photovoltaic cell\"</ref> The rear contact is formed by screen-printing a metal paste, typically aluminium. Usually this contact covers the entire rear, though some designs employ a grid pattern. The paste is then fired at several hundred degrees Celsius to form metal electrodes in [[ohmic contact]] with the silicon. Some companies use an additional electro-plating step to increase efficiency. After the metal contacts are made, the solar cells are interconnected by flat wires or metal ribbons, and assembled into [[photovoltaic module|modules]] or \"solar panels\". Solar panels have a sheet of [[tempered glass]] on the front, and a [[polymer]] encapsulation on the back.\n\n== Manufacturers and certification ==\n{{Further|List of photovoltaics companies}}\n[[File:SolarCellProduction-E.PNG|thumb|right|190px|Solar cell production by region<ref name=\"pvnews\">[http://www.greentechmedia.com/research/report/pv-news Pv News November 2012].

This is larger and heavier than the US [[W48]] nuclear shell at 155 mm (6.1 inches) in diameter and 846 mm (33.3 inches) long and weighing 53.5 kg (118 lb), which represents the smallest complete, self-contained physics package to be fielded and had a yield of 72 tonnes of TNT.

In mid-1998, a special commission of [[Security Council of Russia|Russia's Security Council]] has investigated the storage and utilization of such bombs and found out that no bombs were stolen or lost. Yesin has suggested that Lebed might be misled because of some loose dummy small-scale nuclear bomb, which have the equal size and weight to the real device.

Zorawar Singh was employed by the ambitious Raja [[Gulab Singh]] of [[Jammu]] and was placed under the commandant of the [[Reasi]] fort ([[Bhimgarh fort]]).  While delivering a routine message to the Gulab Singh, Zorawar told him of the financial waste occurring in the fort administration and boldly presented his own scheme to effect savings. Gulab Singh was impressed by Zorawar's sincerity and appointed him commandant of [[Reasi]].\n\nZorawar Singh fulfilled his task and his grateful ruler made him commissariat officer of all forts north of Jammu. He was later made governor of Kishtwar and was given the title of ''Wazir'' (minister).<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|title = Lad\u00e1k, physical, statistical, and historical with notices of the surrounding countries|url = https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=s-VAAAAAcAAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=Suru+River++army+Botis+zorawar+5000&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0CCYQ6AEwAWoVChMIyejgydHUyAIVwV0aCh2VNgpr#v=snippet&q=5000&f=false|publisher = Allen|date = 1854|first = Alexander|last = Cunningham|pages = 10\u201319, 333\u2013340, 349\u2013354}}</ref>\n\nEven though it was a newly conquered region Zorawar had no trouble in keeping the peace; many of the local Rajputs were recruited into his army. In 1835 the nearby region of [[Paddar]] was taken from [[Chamba, Himachal Pradesh|Chamba]] (now in Himachal Pradesh) in the course of a battle.  Paddar later became known for its [[sapphire]] [[Mining|mines]]. But this was a mere sideshow to General Zorawar Singh's more famous expeditions, on which he had already embarked in the previous year.\n\n==The Ladakh campaigns==\n[[File:Zorawerfort.jpg|right|thumb|250px|Zorawar fort in Ladakh]]\nTo the east of Kishtwar and Kashmir are the snow-clad mountains of the upper [[Himalayas]] \u2014 the rivers of [[Zanskar Gorge]], [[Suru River (Indus)|Suru River]], and [[Dras River|Drass]] rise from these snows, and flow across the plateau of [[Ladakh]] into the Indus River. Several petty principalities in this region were tributary to the Gyalpo (King) of Ladakh.  In 1834 one of these, the Raja of Timbus, sought Zorawar's help against the Gyalpo. Meanwhile, the Rajput general had been burning to distinguish himself by expanding the territory of Raja [[Gulab Singh]] \u2014 also at that time, according to the Gulabnama, Kishtwar went through a drought that caused a loss of revenue and forced Zorawar to extract money through war.<ref>{{Cite book|title = Art of Generalship|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=uAmqCQAAQBAJ|publisher = Vij Books India Pvt Ltd|date = 2015-05-07|isbn = 9789382652939|first = K.

The astute general doubled back to Kartse, where he sheltered his troops through the winter. In the spring of 1835 he defeated the large Ladakhi army of Banko Kahlon and marched his victorious troops towards [[Leh]]. The Gyalpo now agreed to pay 50,000 rupees as war-indemnity and 20,000 rupees as an annual tribute.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nAlarmed at the gains of the [[Dogra]]s, the governor of Kashmir, Mehan Singh, incited the Ladakhi chieftains to rebel but Zorawar quickly marched back to the Himalayan valleys and subdued the rebels, now forcing the Raja of Zanskar to also pay a separate tribute to Jammu. But in 1836 Mehan Singh, who was in correspondence with the Lahore durbar, this time instigated the Gyalpo to revolt \u2014 Zorawar force-marched his army in ten days to surprise the Ladakhis and forced them to submit. He now built a fort outside Leh and placed there a garrison of 300 men under Dalel Singh \u2014 the Gyalpo was deposed to an estate and a Ladakhi general, Ngorub Stanzin, was made King. But the latter did not prove to be loyal hence the Gyalpo was restored to his throne in 1838.\n'''\n\n==Baltistan campaign==\nTo the northwest of Ladakh, and to the north of Kashmir, lies the region of [[Baltistan]]. Muhammad Shah, the son of the ruler of [[Skardu]], Raja Ahmad Shah, fled to Leh and sought the aid of the Gyalpo and Zorawar against his father. But some of the Ladakhi nobles allowed Ahmad Shah to imprison his son and sought his aid in a general rebellion against the Dogras. After defeating the Ladakhi rebels Zorawar invaded Baltistan in the winter of 1839/40 (Petech, Kingdom of ladakh, p.&nbsp;144, Datta, Ladakh, p.&nbsp;122 etc. etc.), adding a large contingent of Ladakhis to his army.<ref>{{Cite book|title = Buddhist Western Himalaya: A politico-religious history|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=R4VuovXa5YUC|publisher = Indus Publishing|date = 2001|isbn = 9788173871245|page = 194}}</ref>\n\nThe advance brigade of 5,000 under Nidhan Singh lost its way in the cold and snow and was surrounded by the enemy; many soldiers perished from the cold. Then Mehta Basti Ram, a prominent Rajput from Kishtwar, established contact with the main force. On their arrival the [[Botis]] of Skardu were defeated and forced to flee. They were chased to the fort of Skardu which was invested by Zorawar for a few days. One night the Dogras scaled the steep mountain behind the fort and after some fighting captured the small fort on its crest. From this position the next day they began firing down at the main fort and forced the Raja to surrender. Zorawar built a fort on the banks of the Indus where he placed a contingent of his soldiers.\n\nAfter placing Muhammad Shah on the throne for an annual tribute of 7000 rupees, a Dogra contingent under Wazir Lakhpat advanced westwards, conquered the fort of Astor and took its Darad Raja prisoner. However this Raja was tributary to Mehan Singh, the governor of Kashmir, who was alarmed at the Dogra conquests since they only expanded the kingdom of Gulab Singh while not bringing any benefit to the Lahore durbar. His complaint at [[Lahore]] was forwarded to Raja Gulab Singh at Jammu and he ordered the Darad Raja to be released.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite book|title = General Zorawar Singh|url = https://archive.org/details/generalzorawarsi00char|publisher = Publications Division, Ministry of Information and Broadcasting, Government of India|date = 1983|first = Sukh Dev Singh|last = Charak}}</ref>\n\n==Tibet expedition==\n{{Main|Sino-Sikh war}}\nZorawar Singh turned his energies eastward, towards [[Tibet]].

Another column of 300 men, under Ghulam Khan, marched along the mountains leading up to the [[Kailas Range]] and thus south of the Indus. Zorawar himself led 3,000 men along the plateau region where the vast and picturesque [[Pangong Tso|Pangong Lake]] is located. Sweeping all resistance before them, the three columns passed the [[Lake Manasarovar]] and converged at [[Gartok]], defeating the small Tibetan force stationed there. The enemy commander fled to [[Taklakot]] but Zorawar stormed that fort on 6 September 1841. Envoys from Tibet now came to him as did agents of the Maharaja of [[Nepal]], whose kingdom was only fifteen miles from Taklakot.\n\nThe fall of Taklakot finds mention in the report of the Chinese Imperial Resident, Meng Pao, at [[Lhasa]]:<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=yKPdw2EkTwoC&pg=PA31&dq=On+my+arrival+at+Taklakot+a+force+of+only+about+1,000+local+troops+could+be+mustered,+which+was+divided+and+stationed+as+guards+at+different+posts&hl=en&sa=X&ei=sGWnUaPYIM_PrQe814HgCg&ved=0CDEQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=On%20my%20arrival%20at%20Taklakot%20a%20force%20of%20only%20about%201%2C000%20local%20troops%20could%20be%20mustered%2C%20which%20was%20divided%20and%20stationed%20as%20guards%20at%20different%20posts&f=false Perspectives on South Asian Security by  Shanthie Mariey D'Souza, Rajsthree Jetly]</ref> <blockquote>\"''On my arrival at Taklakot a force of only about 1,000 local troops could be mustered, which was divided and stationed as guards at different posts.

The supplies for the Dogra army over such a long distance failed despite Zorawar's meticulous preparations.\n\nAs the intense cold, coupled with the rain, snow and lightning continued for weeks upon weeks, many of the soldiers lost their fingers and toes to frostbite. Others starved to death, while some burnt the wooden stock of their muskets to warm themselves. The Tibetans and their [[Han Chinese|Chinese]] allies regrouped and advanced to give battle, bypassing the Dogra fort of Chi-T\u2019ang. Zorawar and his men met them at the Battle of To-yo on 12 December 1841\u2014-in the early exchange of fire the Rajput general was wounded in his right shoulder but he grabbed a sword in his left hand.

While delivering a routine message to the Gulab Singh, Zorawar told him of the financial waste occurring in the fort administration and boldly presented his own scheme to effect savings. Gulab Singh was impressed by Zorawar's sincerity and appointed him commandant of [[Reasi]].\n\nZorawar Singh fulfilled his task and his grateful ruler made him commissariat officer of all forts north of Jammu.

In 1835 the nearby region of [[Paddar]] was taken from [[Chamba, Himachal Pradesh|Chamba]] (now in Himachal Pradesh) in the course of a battle.  Paddar later became known for its [[sapphire]] [[Mining|mines]]. But this was a mere sideshow to General Zorawar Singh's more famous expeditions, on which he had already embarked in the previous year.\n\n==The Ladakh campaigns==\n[[File:Zorawerfort.jpg|right|thumb|250px|Zorawar fort in Ladakh]]\nTo the east of Kishtwar and Kashmir are the snow-clad mountains of the upper [[Himalayas]] \u2014 the rivers of [[Zanskar Gorge]], [[Suru River (Indus)|Suru River]], and [[Dras River|Drass]] rise from these snows, and flow across the plateau of [[Ladakh]] into the Indus River. Several petty principalities in this region were tributary to the Gyalpo (King) of Ladakh.  In 1834 one of these, the Raja of Timbus, sought Zorawar's help against the Gyalpo. Meanwhile, the Rajput general had been burning to distinguish himself by expanding the territory of Raja [[Gulab Singh]] \u2014 also at that time, according to the Gulabnama, Kishtwar went through a drought that caused a loss of revenue and forced Zorawar to extract money through war.<ref>{{Cite book|title = Art of Generalship|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=uAmqCQAAQBAJ|publisher = Vij Books India Pvt Ltd|date = 2015-05-07|isbn = 9789382652939|first = K.

The astute general doubled back to Kartse, where he sheltered his troops through the winter. In the spring of 1835 he defeated the large Ladakhi army of Banko Kahlon and marched his victorious troops towards [[Leh]]. The Gyalpo now agreed to pay 50,000 rupees as war-indemnity and 20,000 rupees as an annual tribute.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nAlarmed at the gains of the [[Dogra]]s, the governor of Kashmir, Mehan Singh, incited the Ladakhi chieftains to rebel but Zorawar quickly marched back to the Himalayan valleys and subdued the rebels, now forcing the Raja of Zanskar to also pay a separate tribute to Jammu. But in 1836 Mehan Singh, who was in correspondence with the Lahore durbar, this time instigated the Gyalpo to revolt \u2014 Zorawar force-marched his army in ten days to surprise the Ladakhis and forced them to submit. He now built a fort outside Leh and placed there a garrison of 300 men under Dalel Singh \u2014 the Gyalpo was deposed to an estate and a Ladakhi general, Ngorub Stanzin, was made King. But the latter did not prove to be loyal hence the Gyalpo was restored to his throne in 1838.\n'''\n\n==Baltistan campaign==\nTo the northwest of Ladakh, and to the north of Kashmir, lies the region of [[Baltistan]]. Muhammad Shah, the son of the ruler of [[Skardu]], Raja Ahmad Shah, fled to Leh and sought the aid of the Gyalpo and Zorawar against his father. But some of the Ladakhi nobles allowed Ahmad Shah to imprison his son and sought his aid in a general rebellion against the Dogras. After defeating the Ladakhi rebels Zorawar invaded Baltistan in the winter of 1839/40 (Petech, Kingdom of ladakh, p.&nbsp;144, Datta, Ladakh, p.&nbsp;122 etc. etc.), adding a large contingent of Ladakhis to his army.<ref>{{Cite book|title = Buddhist Western Himalaya: A politico-religious history|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=R4VuovXa5YUC|publisher = Indus Publishing|date = 2001|isbn = 9788173871245|page = 194}}</ref>\n\nThe advance brigade of 5,000 under Nidhan Singh lost its way in the cold and snow and was surrounded by the enemy; many soldiers perished from the cold. Then Mehta Basti Ram, a prominent Rajput from Kishtwar, established contact with the main force. On their arrival the [[Botis]] of Skardu were defeated and forced to flee. They were chased to the fort of Skardu which was invested by Zorawar for a few days. One night the Dogras scaled the steep mountain behind the fort and after some fighting captured the small fort on its crest. From this position the next day they began firing down at the main fort and forced the Raja to surrender. Zorawar built a fort on the banks of the Indus where he placed a contingent of his soldiers.\n\nAfter placing Muhammad Shah on the throne for an annual tribute of 7000 rupees, a Dogra contingent under Wazir Lakhpat advanced westwards, conquered the fort of Astor and took its Darad Raja prisoner. However this Raja was tributary to Mehan Singh, the governor of Kashmir, who was alarmed at the Dogra conquests since they only expanded the kingdom of Gulab Singh while not bringing any benefit to the Lahore durbar. His complaint at [[Lahore]] was forwarded to Raja Gulab Singh at Jammu and he ordered the Darad Raja to be released.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite book|title = General Zorawar Singh|url = https://archive.org/details/generalzorawarsi00char|publisher = Publications Division, Ministry of Information and Broadcasting, Government of India|date = 1983|first = Sukh Dev Singh|last = Charak}}</ref>\n\n==Tibet expedition==\n{{Main|Sino-Sikh war}}\nZorawar Singh turned his energies eastward, towards [[Tibet]].

Another column of 300 men, under Ghulam Khan, marched along the mountains leading up to the [[Kailas Range]] and thus south of the Indus. Zorawar himself led 3,000 men along the plateau region where the vast and picturesque [[Pangong Tso|Pangong Lake]] is located. Sweeping all resistance before them, the three columns passed the [[Lake Manasarovar]] and converged at [[Gartok]], defeating the small Tibetan force stationed there. The enemy commander fled to [[Taklakot]] but Zorawar stormed that fort on 6 September 1841. Envoys from Tibet now came to him as did agents of the Maharaja of [[Nepal]], whose kingdom was only fifteen miles from Taklakot.\n\nThe fall of Taklakot finds mention in the report of the Chinese Imperial Resident, Meng Pao, at [[Lhasa]]:<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=yKPdw2EkTwoC&pg=PA31&dq=On+my+arrival+at+Taklakot+a+force+of+only+about+1,000+local+troops+could+be+mustered,+which+was+divided+and+stationed+as+guards+at+different+posts&hl=en&sa=X&ei=sGWnUaPYIM_PrQe814HgCg&ved=0CDEQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=On%20my%20arrival%20at%20Taklakot%20a%20force%20of%20only%20about%201%2C000%20local%20troops%20could%20be%20mustered%2C%20which%20was%20divided%20and%20stationed%20as%20guards%20at%20different%20posts&f=false Perspectives on South Asian Security by  Shanthie Mariey D'Souza, Rajsthree Jetly]</ref> <blockquote>\"''On my arrival at Taklakot a force of only about 1,000 local troops could be mustered, which was divided and stationed as guards at different posts.

The supplies for the Dogra army over such a long distance failed despite Zorawar's meticulous preparations.\n\nAs the intense cold, coupled with the rain, snow and lightning continued for weeks upon weeks, many of the soldiers lost their fingers and toes to frostbite. Others starved to death, while some burnt the wooden stock of their muskets to warm themselves. The Tibetans and their [[Han Chinese|Chinese]] allies regrouped and advanced to give battle, bypassing the Dogra fort of Chi-T\u2019ang. Zorawar and his men met them at the Battle of To-yo on 12 December 1841\u2014-in the early exchange of fire the Rajput general was wounded in his right shoulder but he grabbed a sword in his left hand.

J. Abrams]] and written by [[Roberto Orci]] and [[Alex Kurtzman]]. It is the eleventh film in the [[Star Trek (film series)|''Star Trek'' film franchise]], and is also a big huge booty that features the main characters of the [[Star Trek: The Original Series|original ''Star Trek'' television series]] portrayed by a new cast, as the first in the rebooted film series. The film follows [[James T. Kirk]] ([[Chris Pine]]) and [[Spock]] ([[Zachary Quinto]]) aboard the [[USS Enterprise (NCC-1701)|USS ''Enterprise'']] as they combat [[Nero (Star Trek)|Nero]] ([[Eric Bana]]), a [[Romulan]] from their future who threatens the [[United Federation of Planets]]. The story takes place in an [[Parallel universe (fiction)|alternate reality]]<ref name=\"MTVAlt1\" /><ref name=\"MTVAlt2\" /> because of [[time travel]] by both Nero and the original Spock ([[Leonard Nimoy]]). The alternate timeline was created in an attempt to free the film and the franchise from established [[Continuity (fiction)|continuity]] constraints while simultaneously preserving original story elements.\n\nThe idea for a prequel film which would follow the ''Star Trek'' characters during their time in [[Starfleet Academy]] was discussed by series creator [[Gene Roddenberry]] in 1968. The concept resurfaced in the late 1980s, when it was postulated by [[Harve Bennett]] as a possible plotline for what would become ''[[Star Trek VI: The Undiscovered Country]]'', but it was rejected in favor of other projects by Roddenberry. Following the critical and commercial failure of ''[[Star Trek: Nemesis]]'' and the cancellation of ''[[Star Trek: Enterprise]]'', the franchise's executive producer [[Rick Berman]] and screenwriter [[Erik Jendresen]] wrote an unproduced film titled ''Star Trek: The Beginning'', which would take place after ''Enterprise''. After the separation of [[Viacom (1952\u20132006)|Viacom]] and [[CBS Corporation]] in 2005, former [[Paramount Pictures]] president [[Gail Berman]] convinced CBS to allow Paramount to produce a new film in the franchise. Orci and Kurtzman, both fans of ''Star Trek'', were approached to write the film, and J. J. Abrams was approached to direct it. Kurtzman and Orci used inspiration from novels and graduate school dissertations, as well as the series itself. Principal photography commenced on November 7, 2007, and ended on March 27, 2008. The film was shot in various locations around California and Utah. Abrams wanted to avoid using bluescreen and greenscreen, opting to use sets and locations instead. Heavy secrecy surrounded the film's production and was under the fake working title ''Corporate Headquarters''. [[Industrial Light & Magic]] used digital ships for the film, as opposed to [[miniature effect|miniatures]] used in most of the previous films in the franchise. (''[[Star Trek: Insurrection]]'' used CGI for almost all ship shots.) Production for the film concluded by the end of 2008.\n\n''Star Trek'' was heavily promoted in the months preceding its release; pre-release screenings for the film premiered in select cities around the world, including [[Austin, Texas]], [[Sydney|Sydney, Australia]], and [[Calgary, Alberta]]. It was released in the United States and Canada on May 8, 2009, to critical acclaim; critics praised its character development, as well as its storyline, effects, stunts, action sequences, direction, and Giacchino's musical score. The film was a box office success, grossing over $385.7 million worldwide against its $150 million production budget. It was nominated for several awards, including four [[Academy Awards]] at the [[82nd Academy Awards]], ultimately winning [[Academy Award for Best Makeup and Hairstyling|Best Makeup]], making it the first ''Star Trek'' film to win an Academy Award. It was followed by the [[sequel]]s ''[[Star Trek Into Darkness]]'' and ''[[Star Trek Beyond]]'' in 2013 and 2016, respectively.\n\n==Plot==\n<!-- PER WP:FILMPLOT, PLOT SUMMARIES SHOULD BE BETWEEN 400 AND 700 WORDS. -->\nIn the 23rd century, the [[United Federation of Planets|Federation]] [[starship]] USS ''Kelvin'' is investigating a \"lightning storm\" in space. A [[Romulan]] ship, ''Narada'', emerges from the storm and attacks the ''Kelvin''. ''Narada''{{'}}s [[Executive officer|first officer]], Ayel, demands that ''Kelvin''{{'}}s Captain Robau come aboard to negotiate a truce. Robau is questioned about the current [[stardate]] and an \"Ambassador [[Spock]]\", whom he does not recognize. ''Narada''{{'}}s commander, [[Nero (Star Trek)|Nero]], kills him, and resumes attacking the ''Kelvin''. George Kirk, ''Kelvin''{{'}}s first officer, orders the ship's personnel, including his pregnant wife Winona, to abandon ship while he pilots the ''Kelvin'' on a collision course with ''Narada''. Kirk sacrifices his life to ensure Winona's survival as she gives birth to [[James T. Kirk]].\n\nSeventeen years later on the planet [[Vulcan (Star Trek)#Homeworld|Vulcan]], a young Spock is accepted to join the Vulcan Science Academy. Realizing that the Academy views his human mother, Amanda, as a \"disadvantage\", he joins [[Starfleet]] instead. On [[Earth]], Kirk becomes a reckless but intelligent young adult. Following a bar fight with Starfleet cadets accompanying [[Uhura|Nyota Uhura]], Kirk meets Captain [[Christopher Pike (Star Trek)|Christopher Pike]], who encourages him to enlist in [[Starfleet Academy]], where Kirk meets and befriends doctor [[Leonard McCoy]].\n\nThree years later, Commander Spock accuses Kirk of cheating during the ''[[Kobayashi Maru]]'' simulation. Kirk argues that cheating was acceptable because the simulation was designed to be unbeatable. The disciplinary hearing is interrupted by a distress signal from Vulcan. With the primary fleet out of range, the cadets are mobilized. McCoy and Kirk board Pike's ship, the {{USS|Enterprise|NCC-1701|2}}. Realizing that the \"lightning storm\" observed near Vulcan is similar to the one that occurred when he was born, Kirk breaks protocol to convince Pike that the distress signal is a trap.\n\n''Enterprise'' arrives to find the fleet destroyed and ''Narada'' drilling into Vulcan's [[planetary core|core]]. ''Narada'' attacks ''Enterprise'' and Pike surrenders, delegating command of the ship to Spock and promoting Kirk to first officer. Kirk, [[Hikaru Sulu]], and [[chief engineer|Chief Engineer]] Olson perform a [[space diving|space jump]]<ref name=\"CNN.com\">{{cite news |url=http://edition.cnn.com/2009/SHOWBIZ/Movies/05/08/the.scene.star.trek/index.html#cnnSTCText |title=The Scene: 'Trek' actors dive onto Vulcan |last=Cargill |first=J.D. |date=May 8, 2009 |website=CNN |accessdate=December 10, 2009}}</ref><ref name=\"Bad Astronomy Review: Star Trek\">{{cite web |url=http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/2009/05/08/ba-review-star-trek |title=BA Review: Star Trek |last=Plait |first=Phil |date=May 8, 2009 |work=[[Discover (magazine)|Discover]] |publisher=[[Kalmbach Publishing]] |accessdate=December 10, 2009}}</ref> onto the drilling platform. Olson is killed mid-jump, but Kirk and Sulu successfully reach and disable the drill. Despite ''Enterprise's'' efforts, Nero launches \"red matter\" into Vulcan's core, forming an artificial [[black hole]] that destroys Vulcan. ''Enterprise'' manages to rescue Spock's father, [[Sarek]], and the high council, but not Amanda, who falls to her death before the [[Transporter (Star Trek)|transporter]] can properly lock onto her.\n\nAs ''Narada'' moves toward Earth, Nero tortures Pike to gain access to Earth's defense codes. Spock maroons Kirk on Delta Vega after Kirk attempts [[mutiny]]. Kirk encounters an older Spock, who explains that he and Nero are from 129 years in the future. In that future, [[Romulan#Romulus|Romulus]] was threatened by a [[supernova]]. Spock's attempt to use \"red matter\" to create an artificial black hole and consume the supernova failed, and Nero's family perished along with Romulus. ''Narada'' and Spock's vessel were caught in the black hole, sending them back in time. Nero stranded Spock on Delta Vega to watch Vulcan's destruction.\n\nReaching a Starfleet outpost on Delta Vega, Kirk and the elder Spock meet [[Scotty (Star Trek)|Montgomery Scott]]. With the elder Spock's help, Scott devises a way for Kirk to [[Transporter (Star Trek)|beam]] onto ''Enterprise'' while it is travelling at warp speed. Following the elder Spock's advice, Kirk provokes younger Spock into attacking him, forcing Spock to recognize himself as emotionally compromised and relinquish command to Kirk. After talking with Sarek, Spock decides to help Kirk. While ''Enterprise'' hides itself within the gas clouds of [[Titan (moon)|Titan]], Kirk and Spock beam aboard ''Narada''. Kirk fights with Nero and Ayel, killing the latter and rescuing Pike, while Spock uses the elder Spock's ship to destroy the drill. Spock leads ''Narada'' away from Earth and sets his ship to collide with Nero's ship. ''Enterprise'' beams Kirk, Pike, and Spock aboard. The older Spock's ship and ''Narada'' collide, igniting the \"red matter\". Kirk offers Nero help to escape, but Nero refuses, prompting Kirk to give the order to fire, dooming ''Narada'' to be consumed in a black hole.\n\nKirk is promoted to Captain and given command of ''Enterprise'', while Pike is promoted to Rear Admiral. Spock encounters his older self, who persuades his younger self to continue serving in Starfleet, encouraging him to do, for once, what feels right instead of what is logical. Spock remains in Starfleet, becoming first officer under Kirk's command. ''Enterprise'' goes to warp as the elder Spock speaks the \"[[where no man has gone before|where no one has gone before]]\" monologue.\n\n==Cast==\n{{multiple image\n| direction = vertical\n| width     = 190\n| footer    = From top to bottom: Chris Pine, Zachary Quinto and Zoe Saldana.\n| image1    = Chris Pine by Gage Skidmore.jpg\n| alt1      =\n| caption1  =\n| image2    = Zachary Quinto by Gage Skidmore.jpg\n| alt2      =\n| caption2  =\n| image3    = Zoe Saldana (Headshot).jpg\n| alt3      =\n| caption3  =\n}}\n* [[Chris Pine]] as [[James T.

J. Abrams]] and written by [[Roberto Orci]] and [[Alex Kurtzman]]. It is the eleventh film in the [[Star Trek (film series)|''Star Trek'' film franchise]], and is also a [[Reboot (fiction)|reboot]] that features the main characters of the [[Star Trek: The Original Series|original ''Star Trek'' television series]] portrayed by a new cast, as the first in the rebooted film series. The film follows [[James T. Kirk]] ([[Chris Pine]]) and [[Spock]] ([[Zachary Quinto]]) aboard the [[USS Enterprise (NCC-1701)|USS ''Enterprise'']] as they combat [[Nero (Star Trek)|Nero]] ([[Eric Bana]]), a [[Romulan]] from their future who threatens the [[United Federation of Planets]]. The story takes place in an [[Parallel universe (fiction)|alternate reality]]<ref name=\"MTVAlt1\" /><ref name=\"MTVAlt2\" /> because of [[time travel]] by both Nero and the original Spock ([[Leonard Nimoy]]). The alternate timeline was created in an attempt to free the film and the franchise from established [[Continuity (fiction)|continuity]] constraints while simultaneously preserving original story elements.\n\nThe idea for a prequel film which would follow the ''Star Trek'' characters during their time in [[Starfleet Academy]] was discussed by series creator [[Gene Roddenberry]] in 1968. The concept resurfaced in the late 1980s, when it was postulated by [[Harve Bennett]] as a possible plotline for what would become ''[[Star Trek VI: The Undiscovered Country]]'', but it was rejected in favor of other projects by Roddenberry. Following the critical and commercial failure of ''[[Star Trek: Nemesis]]'' and the cancellation of ''[[Star Trek: Enterprise]]'', the franchise's executive producer [[Rick Berman]] and screenwriter [[Erik Jendresen]] wrote an unproduced film titled ''Star Trek: The Beginning'', which would take place after ''Enterprise''. After the separation of [[Viacom (1952\u20132006)|Viacom]] and [[CBS Corporation]] in 2005, former [[Paramount Pictures]] president [[Gail Berman]] convinced CBS to allow Paramount to produce a new film in the franchise. Orci and Kurtzman, both fans of ''Star Trek'', were approached to write the film, and J. J. Abrams was approached to direct it. Kurtzman and Orci used inspiration from novels and graduate school dissertations, as well as the series itself. Principal photography commenced on November 7, 2007, and ended on March 27, 2008. The film was shot in various locations around California and Utah. Abrams wanted to avoid using bluescreen and greenscreen, opting to use sets and locations instead. Heavy secrecy surrounded the film's production and was under the fake working title ''Corporate Headquarters''. [[Industrial Light & Magic]] used digital ships for the film, as opposed to [[miniature effect|miniatures]] used in most of the previous films in the franchise. (''[[Star Trek: Insurrection]]'' used CGI for almost all ship shots.) Production for the film concluded by the end of 2008.\n\n''Star Trek'' was heavily promoted in the months preceding its release; pre-release screenings for the film premiered in select cities around the world, including [[Austin, Texas]], [[Sydney|Sydney, Australia]], and [[Calgary, Alberta]]. It was released in the United States and Canada on May 8, 2009, to critical acclaim; critics praised its character development, as well as its storyline, effects, stunts, action sequences, direction, and Giacchino's musical score. The film was a box office success, grossing over $385.7 million worldwide against its $150 million production budget. It was nominated for several awards, including four [[Academy Awards]] at the [[82nd Academy Awards]], ultimately winning [[Academy Award for Best Makeup and Hairstyling|Best Makeup]], making it the first ''Star Trek'' film to win an Academy Award. It was followed by the [[sequel]]s ''[[Star Trek Into Darkness]]'' and ''[[Star Trek Beyond]]'' in 2013 and 2016, respectively.\n\n==Plot==\n<!-- PER WP:FILMPLOT, PLOT SUMMARIES SHOULD BE BETWEEN 400 AND 700 WORDS. -->\nIn the 23rd century, the [[United Federation of Planets|Federation]] [[starship]] USS ''Kelvin'' is investigating a \"lightning storm\" in space. A [[Romulan]] ship, ''Narada'', emerges from the storm and attacks the ''Kelvin''. ''Narada''{{'}}s [[Executive officer|first officer]], Ayel, demands that ''Kelvin''{{'}}s Captain Robau come aboard to negotiate a truce. Robau is questioned about the current [[stardate]] and an \"Ambassador [[Spock]]\", whom he does not recognize. ''Narada''{{'}}s commander, [[Nero (Star Trek)|Nero]], kills him, and resumes attacking the ''Kelvin''. George Kirk, ''Kelvin''{{'}}s first officer, orders the ship's personnel, including his pregnant wife Winona, to abandon ship while he pilots the ''Kelvin'' on a collision course with ''Narada''. Kirk sacrifices his life to ensure Winona's survival as she gives birth to [[James T. Kirk]].\n\nSeventeen years later on the planet [[Vulcan (Star Trek)#Homeworld|Vulcan]], a young Spock is accepted to join the Vulcan Science Academy. Realizing that the Academy views his human mother, Amanda, as a \"disadvantage\", he joins [[Starfleet]] instead. On [[Earth]], Kirk becomes a reckless but intelligent young adult. Following a bar fight with Starfleet cadets accompanying [[Uhura|Nyota Uhura]], Kirk meets Captain [[Christopher Pike (Star Trek)|Christopher Pike]], who encourages him to enlist in [[Starfleet Academy]], where Kirk meets and befriends doctor [[Leonard McCoy]].\n\nThree years later, Commander Spock accuses Kirk of cheating during the ''[[Kobayashi Maru]]'' simulation. Kirk argues that cheating was acceptable because the simulation was designed to be unbeatable. The disciplinary hearing is interrupted by a distress signal from Vulcan. With the primary fleet out of range, the cadets are mobilized. McCoy and Kirk board Pike's ship, the {{USS|Enterprise|NCC-1701|2}}. Realizing that the \"lightning storm\" observed near Vulcan is similar to the one that occurred when he was born, Kirk breaks protocol to convince Pike that the distress signal is a trap.\n\n''Enterprise'' arrives to find the fleet destroyed and ''Narada'' drilling into Vulcan's [[planetary core|core]]. ''Narada'' attacks ''Enterprise'' and Pike surrenders, delegating command of the ship to Spock and promoting Kirk to first officer. Kirk, [[Hikaru Sulu]], and [[chief engineer|Chief Engineer]] Olson perform a [[space diving|space jump]]<ref name=\"CNN.com\">{{cite news |url=http://edition.cnn.com/2009/SHOWBIZ/Movies/05/08/the.scene.star.trek/index.html#cnnSTCText |title=The Scene: 'Trek' actors dive onto Vulcan |last=Cargill |first=J.D. |date=May 8, 2009 |website=CNN |accessdate=December 10, 2009}}</ref><ref name=\"Bad Astronomy Review: Star Trek\">{{cite web |url=http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/2009/05/08/ba-review-star-trek |title=BA Review: Star Trek |last=Plait |first=Phil |date=May 8, 2009 |work=[[Discover (magazine)|Discover]] |publisher=[[Kalmbach Publishing]] |accessdate=December 10, 2009}}</ref> onto the drilling platform. Olson is killed mid-jump, but Kirk and Sulu successfully reach and disable the drill. Despite ''Enterprise's'' efforts, Nero launches \"red matter\" into Vulcan's core, forming an artificial [[black hole]] that destroys Vulcan. ''Enterprise'' manages to rescue Spock's father, [[Sarek]], and the high council, but not Amanda, who falls to her death before the [[Transporter (Star Trek)|transporter]] can properly lock onto her.\n\nAs ''Narada'' moves toward Earth, Nero tortures Pike to gain access to Earth's defense codes. Spock maroons Kirk on Delta Vega after Kirk attempts [[mutiny]]. Kirk encounters an older Spock, who explains that he and Nero are from 129 years in the future. In that future, [[Romulan#Romulus|Romulus]] was threatened by a [[supernova]]. Spock's attempt to use \"red matter\" to create an artificial black hole and consume the supernova failed, and Nero's family perished along with Romulus. ''Narada'' and Spock's vessel were caught in the black hole, sending them back in time. Nero stranded Spock on Delta Vega to watch Vulcan's destruction.\n\nReaching a Starfleet outpost on Delta Vega, Kirk and the elder Spock meet [[Scotty (Star Trek)|Montgomery Scott]]. With the elder Spock's help, Scott devises a way for Kirk to [[Transporter (Star Trek)|beam]] onto ''Enterprise'' while it is travelling at warp speed. Following the elder Spock's advice, Kirk provokes younger Spock into attacking him, forcing Spock to recognize himself as emotionally compromised and relinquish command to Kirk. After talking with Sarek, Spock decides to help Kirk. While ''Enterprise'' hides itself within the gas clouds of [[Titan (moon)|Titan]], Kirk and Spock beam aboard ''Narada''. Kirk fights with Nero and Ayel, killing the latter and rescuing Pike, while Spock uses the elder Spock's ship to destroy the drill. Spock leads ''Narada'' away from Earth and sets his ship to collide with Nero's ship. ''Enterprise'' beams Kirk, Pike, and Spock aboard. The older Spock's ship and ''Narada'' collide, igniting the \"red matter\". Kirk offers Nero help to escape, but Nero refuses, prompting Kirk to give the order to fire, dooming ''Narada'' to be consumed in a black hole.\n\nKirk is promoted to Captain and given command of ''Enterprise'', while Pike is promoted to Rear Admiral. Spock encounters his older self, who persuades his younger self to continue serving in Starfleet, encouraging him to do, for once, what feels right instead of what is logical. Spock remains in Starfleet, becoming first officer under Kirk's command. ''Enterprise'' goes to warp as the elder Spock speaks the \"[[where no man has gone before|where no one has gone before]]\" monologue.\n\n==Cast==\n{{multiple image\n| direction = vertical\n| width     = 190\n| footer    = From top to bottom: Chris Pine, Zachary Quinto and Zoe Saldana.\n| image1    = Chris Pine by Gage Skidmore.jpg\n| alt1      =\n| caption1  =\n| image2    = Zachary Quinto by Gage Skidmore.jpg\n| alt2      =\n| caption2  =\n| image3    = Zoe Saldana (Headshot).jpg\n| alt3      =\n| caption3  =\n}}\n* [[Chris Pine]] as [[James T.

Burtt reproduced the classic photon torpedo and warp drive sounds: he tapped a long spring against a [[contact microphone]], and combined that with cannon fire.

In 1993, [[Scarsdale, New York]] native and businessman [[Paul Heyman]] took over the creative end of the promotion from Eddie Gilbert and rechristened the promotion from Eastern Championship Wrestling to \"Extreme\" Championship Wrestling. The promotion showcased various international styles of professional wrestling, ranging from [[lucha libre]] to [[puroresu]] and [[hardcore wrestling]]. Heyman's creative direction created new stars, and established the \"third\" big brand in the United States, competing with the billionaire-backed [[WWE|World Wrestling Federation]] and [[World Championship Wrestling]] promotions. HHG closed ECW in 2001 when it was unable to secure a new national television contract, and World Wrestling Entertainment, Inc. purchased the assets of the company from bankruptcy in January 2003.\n\nAfter purchasing the assets of ECW, WWE relaunched the Extreme Championship Wrestling franchise as a [[WWE Brand Extension|third brand]] with their existing [[Raw (WWE brand)|Raw]] and [[SmackDown (WWE brand)|SmackDown]] brands. It debuted on June 13, 2006 on Sci Fi in the United States and ran for close to four years until it aired its final episode on February 16, 2010 on the rebranded [[Syfy]].\n\n==History==\n\n===Tri-State Wrestling Alliance and NWA Eastern Championship Wrestling (1989\u20131994)===\nECW had its origins in 1989 under the banner Tri-State Wrestling Alliance owned by Joel Goodhart.<ref name=\"shaggs\">[http://members.tripod.com/~ecwbyshaggs/interview.html Interviews]</ref> ECW would, in fact, continue to use the former Tri-State Heavyweight championship belt to represent its own Championship, although the ECW title was not considered a continuation of that title. In 1992, Goodhart sold his share of the company to his partner, [[Tod Gordon]], who renamed the promotion '''Eastern Championship Wrestling'''.<ref name=\"HardcoreHistory\">{{cite book|title=Hardcore History: The Extremely Unauthorized Story of ECW|last=Williams|first=Scott|publisher=Sports Publishing LLC|year=2006|isbn=978-1-59670-021-5}}</ref> When Eastern Championship Wrestling was founded, it wasn't a member of the [[National Wrestling Alliance]] (NWA). At the time, [[Eddie Gilbert (wrestler)|\"Hot Stuff\" Eddie Gilbert]],<ref>[http://www.eddiegilbert.com/profile2.html Doors Open and Doors Close]</ref> the lead booker of Eastern Championship Wrestling, had managed to secure television time on [[SportsChannel Philadelphia]] starting in April 1993.<ref name=ECDub61>Loverro, Thom (2006).

Heyman, known on television as Paul E. Dangerously, had just been fired by [[World Championship Wrestling]] (WCW) and was looking for a new challenge.<ref name=\"HardcoreHistory\"/> [[File:NWA Eastern Championship Logo 1993.png|thumb|200px|Eastern Championship Wrestling logo.]]\n\n===Secession from the NWA (1994)===\nIn 1994, [[Jim Crockett, Jr.|Jim Crockett's]] [[non-compete agreement]] with [[Ted Turner]], who purchased [[World Championship Wrestling]] (WCW) from Crockett in November 1988, was up and he decided to start promoting with the NWA again.<ref name=\"HardcoreHistory\"/> Crockett went to Tod Gordon and asked him to hold a tournament for the NWA's top prize, the [[NWA World Heavyweight Championship]], in ECW's home area of [[Philadelphia|Philadelphia, Pennsylvania]] on August 27, 1994. NWA President Dennis Coralluzzo alleged that Crockett and Gordon were going to try to monopolize the title<ref>[http://www.angelfire.com/wrestling3/keysplace/nwa.html History of the National Wrestling Alliance]</ref> (akin to Crockett's actions in the 1980s) and stated Crockett did not have the NWA board's approval, which resulted in Coralluzzo personally overseeing the tournament. Gordon took offense at Coralluzzo for his power plays and began contemplating a plan to secede ECW from the NWA through a controversial and public manner that would attract attention to ECW and insult the NWA organization. Gordon planned to have [[Shane Douglas]], who was scheduled to face [[2 Cold Scorpio]] in the tournament finals on August 30, 1994, throw down the NWA World Heavyweight Championship belt upon winning as an act of defiance.<ref>[http://www.wrestlingepicenter.com/shows/ShaneDouglas/ Shane Douglas on throwing down the title]</ref><ref name=\"2006 Hall Of Fame Inductees\">[http://www.wrestlingclothesline.com/HallOfFameDennis.htm 2006 Hall Of Fame Inductees]</ref>\n\nTod Gordon and Paul Heyman originally planned the idea of throwing down the NWA World Heavyweight Championship belt. Heyman persuaded Douglas by noting that the negative would only be that NWA traditionalists would just see them as traitors to tradition. Adding to Douglas' decision was the animosity between Douglas and NWA President Dennis Coralluzzo, who at the time publicly criticized Douglas and told NWA affiliated bookers not to book Douglas for shows. Coralluzzo believed that Douglas was a \"bad risk\" and had the tendency to [[no-show (professional wrestling)|no-show]] events.<ref>[http://www.wrestlingepicenter.com/shows/ShaneDouglas/ Douglas on Coralluzzo]</ref> Douglas ultimately decided to go through with Gordon and Heyman's plan, inspired by his father's [[motto]] of \"doing right by the people that do right by you.\" After looking up and saying, \"This is it tonight, Dad,\" Douglas threw down the NWA World Heavyweight Championship belt, stating that he did not want to be champion of a \"dead promotion\" that \"died seven years ago.\" <ref name=\"HardcoreHistory\"/> He then raised the Eastern Championship Wrestling title belt and declared it to be a [[World Heavyweight Championship (professional wrestling)|World Heavyweight Championship]] \u2014 calling it the only real world title left in professional wrestling. When recalling this event years later, Paul Heyman stated the following in a 1998 chat:\n\n:{{cquote|The National Wrestling Alliance was old-school when old-school wasn't hip anymore. We wanted to set our mark, we wanted to breakaway from the pack, we wanted to let the world know that we weren't just some independent promotion.<ref name=\"shaggs\"/>}}\n\nCoralluzzo was interviewed after the event and declared that Douglas would be the world champion of the NWA \"whether he likes it or not\", calling Douglas' actions a \"disgrace\" and said he would move to have Douglas stripped of both the NWA World Heavyweight Championship and the Eastern Championship Wrestling Heavyweight Championship, calling him \"undeserving\" of both titles.<ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6W_slOrFvuQ \"Tod Gordon Announces Birth of Extreme\".]</ref> Gordon made the following announcement on the next edition of NWA-ECW programming:\n\n{{cquote|I listened with great interest as the representative of the NWA board of directors took it upon himself to inform you that they have the power to force NWA-Eastern Championship Wrestling not to recognize The Franchise, Shane Douglas, as a world heavyweight champion. Well, as of noon today, I have folded NWA-Eastern Championship Wrestling. In its place will be ECW- ''Extreme'' Championship Wrestling- and we recognize The Franchise, Shane Douglas, as our World Heavyweight Champion. And we encourage any wrestler in the world today to come to the ECW to challenge for that belt. This is the ECW, Extreme Championship Wrestling, changing the face of professional wrestling.}}\n\nThe promotion showcased many different styles of professional wrestling, including [[hardcore wrestling]] matches as well as [[lucha libre]] and [[puroresu|Japanese wrestling]] styles.\n\n===ECW Arena and television syndication (1994\u20132001)===\n{{See also|ECW Hardcore TV}}\nThe bulk of ECW's shows remained at the [[2300 Arena|ECW Arena]], a former warehouse secluded under a section of [[Interstate 95 in Pennsylvania|Interstate 95]]. Seating comprised simple folding chairs and four sets of portable bleachers, with the unconventional scene reflective of the gritty style of the promotion itself. Shows were broadcast on a Philadelphia local cable sports station ([[SportsChannel America]]'s local affiliate, [[SportsChannel Philadelphia]]) on Tuesday evenings. After Sports Channel Philadelphia went off the air in 1997, the show moved to [[WPPX|WPPX-TV 61]]. It later moved to a former independent broadcast station ([[WGTW-TV|WGTW]] 48) in Philadelphia on either Friday or Saturday night at 1 or 2 a.m. Shows were also aired on the [[MSG (TV network)|MSG Network]] in NYC on Friday nights (Early Saturday morning) at 2 a.m. Due to the obscurity of the stations and ECW itself, as well as the lack of [[Federal Communications Commission|FCC]] oversight at that late hour, many times expletives and violence were not edited out of these showings, along with extensive use of copyrighted music and music videos.\n\n===Paul Heyman and cross promotion with the WWF and the USWA (1996\u20131997)===\nIn 1995, [[Tod Gordon]] sold Extreme Championship Wrestling, Inc., to his head [[Professional wrestling booker|booker]], [[Paul Heyman]], trading as HHG Corporation. Afterward, Gordon remained in ECW as a figurehead commissioner. Years after being the ECW \"Commissioner\", Gordon left ECW in May 1997, his absence was explained on-air that he retired from wrestling due to family. Rumors circulated, however, that Gordon was fired by Heyman after he was suspected as a \"locker room mole\" for a rival wrestling promotion, helping to lure talent to World Championship Wrestling.\n\nStoryline-wise, [[Vince McMahon]] first became \"aware\" of ECW while at the 1995 [[King of the Ring (1995)|King of the Ring]] event in ECW's home base of Philadelphia. During the match between [[Viscera (wrestler)|Mabel]] and [[Savio Vega]], the crowd suddenly started to chant, \"ECW ECW ECW!\". On September 22, 1996, at the [[In Your House 10: Mind Games|In Your House: Mind Games]] event in Philadelphia, ECW stars [[The Sandman (wrestler)|The Sandman]], [[Tommy Dreamer]], Paul Heyman, and [[Tazz|Taz]] were in the front row with Sandman even interfering in one match (when he threw beer on Savio Vega during his strap match with [[John Layfield|Bradshaw]]). McMahon acknowledged ECW's status as a local, up and coming promotion on the air. The following night on WWF ''Monday Night RAW'', broadcast on September 23, 1996, at the onset of a match between The Bodydonnas vs. The British Bulldog and Owen Hart, Bill Alfonso, and Tazz could be seen invading the program. Both Tazz and Alfonso were able to successfully jump the security rails, and Tazz was able to prominently display a bright orange sign with black lettering that read \"[[Sabu (wrestler)|Sabu]] Fears Tazz-ECW\". On February 24, 1997, ECW \"invaded\" ''Raw'' from the [[Manhattan Center]]. They advanced a storyline, plugged their first ever pay-per-view and worked three matches in front of the WWF audience while McMahon called the action with both Jerry \"The King\" Lawler and Paul Heyman. The Manhattan Center in [[New York City|New York]] was peppered with a large number of ECW fans, who gave the WWF wrestlers \"Boring!\" chants when they felt it was warranted. Likewise, when the ECW performers arrived, they [[Pop (professional wrestling)|popped]] and introduced the WWF Monday night audience to some trademark ECW group chants. This invasion sparked an inter-promotional feud between ECW and Lawler's [[United States Wrestling Association]]. Lawler disparaged ECW on-camera and convinced wrestlers such as [[Rob Van Dam]] and Sabu to join him in an anti-ECW crusade. Throughout 1997, ECW wrestlers appeared on USWA television programs, and vice versa. As part of the working relationship between ECW and the WWF, a number of WWF-contracted wrestlers were sent to ECW for seasoning in 1997, including [[Darren Drozdov|Droz]] and [[Achim Albrecht|Brakkus]].<ref name=\"Torch28Dec02\">{{cite web|url=http://pwtorch.com/artman2/publish/Torch_Flashbacks_19/article_2016.shtml|date=December 28, 2002|title=5 Yrs Ago: ECW News - GnR's Slash, Jenna Jameson no-show PPV|author=Powell, Jason|publisher=[[Pro Wrestling Torch Newsletter|Pro Wrestling Torch]]|accessdate=2012-09-24}}</ref><ref name=\"Torch21Nov04\">{{cite web|url=http://pwtorch.com/artman2/publish/WWE_News_3/article_10870.shtml|date=November 21, 2004|title=Interview Highlights: Heyman on WCW, NWA-TNA, being on WWF payroll in 1996|author=Powell, Jason|publisher=[[Pro Wrestling Torch Newsletter|Pro Wrestling Torch]]|accessdate=2012-09-24}}</ref>\n\nOn April 13, 1997 ECW broadcast their first pay-per-view (PPV) wrestling card [[ECW Barely Legal|Barely Legal]], highlighted by [[Terry Funk]] defeating [[Raven (wrestler)|Raven]] to win the ECW World Heavyweight Championship. In June 1997, the company's [[ECW Wrestlepalooza#1997|Wrestlepalooza '97]] event featured Raven's final ECW match before leaving for WCW. In this match, Tommy Dreamer finally beat Raven, his longtime nemesis. Dreamer's celebration was short-lived, though, as Jerry Lawler, along with Sabu and Rob Van Dam showed up to attack Dreamer. This set up a match between Dreamer and Lawler at the pay-per-view, [[Hardcore Heaven#1997|1997 Hardcore Heaven]], on August 17, which was won by Dreamer. ECW continued through 1998 and early 1999 with a string of successful pay-per-views.\n\n===Mike Awesome controversy and promotional rivalry (2000)===\nIn April 2000, [[Mike Awesome]] made a surprise appearance on ''[[WCW Monday Nitro]]'' \u2013 making his debut by attacking [[Kevin Nash]] \u2013 while still reigning as [[ECW World Heavyweight Championship|ECW World Heavyweight Champion]].

After Paul Heyman filed an injunction, WCW refrained from having Awesome appear on ''Nitro'' with the belt, but did acknowledge him as the champion. Eventually, a compromise was reached. Awesome (a WCW employee and the reigning ECW World Heavyweight champion) appeared at an April 13, 2000 ECW event in [[Indianapolis|Indianapolis, Indiana]],<ref>{{cite web|last=Molinaro|first=John F.|title=Tazz wins ECW World title|date=2000-04-14|publisher=Slam!

At the time Los Angeles was home to [[Xtreme Pro Wrestling]] (XPW), and its owner [[Rob Zicari|Rob Black]] purchased six front row tickets for the show. The tickets were given to a cadre of XPW talent, and their mission was to make it clear that ECW was on enemy turf. This was not a storyline. At the beginning of the main event, the XPW contingent donned shirts emblazoned with the XPW logo, gaining the attention of security and ECW wrestler Tommy Dreamer. Security ejected the XPW group from the building and later, a brawl broke out in the parking lot between members of the XPW ring crew and the ECW locker room. The XPW wrestlers were not involved in the fracas, during which the ECW wrestlers brutalized the XPW ring crew with several of the ring crew members left in pools of their own blood.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.trashtalkingradio.com/tt/2005/tt06-28-05b.ram |title=trashtalkingradio |access-date=2007-09-02 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110717093437/http://www.trashtalkingradio.com/tt/2005/tt06-28-05b.ram |archive-date=2011-07-17 |url-status=dead }}</ref> Initial reports claimed that XPW valet [[Kristi Myst]] had somehow touched ECW valet [[Francine Fournier]] and that this is what prompted the incident, but Fournier herself has since gone on record as saying that she was never grabbed or in any other way touched by any of the XPW crew, and other eyewitnesses support the story that Fournier never had a hand laid on her. XPW was not acknowledged by ECW announcer [[Joey Styles]] during the pay-per-view telecast, however at the November to Remember pay-per-view a few months later, color-commentator [[Don Callis]] made a subtle reference to the incident, describing a wild brawl as \"looking like a Los Angeles parking lot\". The XPW contingent at ringside consisted of wrestlers [[The Messiah (wrestler)|The Messiah]], Kid Kaos, Supreme, Kristi Myst, Homeless Jimmy and XPW announcer Kris Kloss.\n\n===''ECW on TNN'' and decline (1999\u20132001)===\n{{Main|ECW on TNN}}\nIn August 1999, ECW began to broadcast nationally on [[The Nashville Network|TNN]] (for what was initially a three-year contract). Despite no advertising and a low budget, ECW became TNN's highest [[Nielsen ratings|rated]] show. ''ECW on TNN'' was cancelled in October 2000 (with the final episode airing on October 6, 2000) in favor of ''[[WWE Raw|WWF Raw]]'' moving to the network. Paul Heyman stated he believed that the inability to land another national television deal was the cause of ECW's demise.<ref name=riseDVD>{{cite video|title=The Rise and Fall of ECW|medium=DVD|publisher=[[WWE|World Wrestling Entertainment]]|date=2004}}</ref>\n\nECW struggled for months after the cancellation, trying to secure a new national TV deal.

Wrestlers and talent were listed, with amounts owed ranging from $2 for Sabu and [[Steve Corino]] to hundreds, and in some cases, thousands of dollars. The highest amounts owed to talents were [[Rob Van Dam]] ($150,000),<ref name=\"HardcoreHistory\"/><ref name=BetweenTheRopes/> Shane Douglas ($145,000),<ref>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHANWlcQPg&t=474s</ref> Tommy Dreamer ($100,000),<ref name=BetweenTheRopes/> [[Joey Styles]] ($50,480),<ref name=\"HardcoreHistory\"/><ref name=BetweenTheRopes/> [[Rhyno]] ($50,000),<ref name=\"HardcoreHistory\"/><ref name=BetweenTheRopes/> and Francine Fournier ($47,275).<ref name=\"HardcoreHistory\"/><ref name=BetweenTheRopes/> These assets were eventually purchased by World Wrestling Entertainment Inc. On January 28, 2003<ref>https://www.scribd.com/doc/305765539/WWE-acquires-ECW-Assets-HHG-Corporation</ref>, World Wrestling Entertainment Inc. purchased ECW's assets from HHG Corporation in court, acquiring the rights to ECW's video library.\n\n==Legacy and resurface==\n\nIn ECW, there were virtually no rules. The role of referees only included counting pinfalls, acknowledging submissions, and upholding rope breaks. ECW was known for making popular several types of matches, including the [[Three Way Dance|3-Way Dance]], [[Hardcore wrestling|Barbed wire match]], [[WarGames match|Ultimate Jeopardy steel cage match]], [[Tables match|Flaming Tables match]], and [[Professional wrestling match types#Weapon-based variations|Singapore Cane match]] among others.\n\nThe \"Big Two\" (World Championship Wrestling and the World Wrestling Federation) began hiring away their talent. ECW, according to Heyman, was the first victim of the \"[[Monday Night Wars]]\" between ''[[WCW Monday Nitro]]'' and ''[[WWE Raw|Monday Night Raw]]''. The WWF had a working relationship with ECW, going so far as to participate in cross-promotional angles, providing talent on loan in exchange for developed young talent and marketable gimmicks (Al Snow's \"head\" gimmick among them), and even providing financial aid to Heyman for a considerable period of time. WCW on the other hand, refused to even mention ECW by name (with a few notable exceptions; including a passing remark by [[Raven (wrestler)|Raven]] in late 1997 and [[Kevin Nash]] and [[Scott Hall (wrestler)|Scott Hall]] mentioning it as a viable second option in American wrestling in a slight on their main competition, the World Wrestling Federation). It was referred to as \"barbed wire city\" and \"a major [[Independent circuit|independent]] promotion that wrestled in bingo halls\" during a segment directed at [[Diamond Dallas Page]].\n\n===The Alliance===\n{{Main|The Invasion (professional wrestling)}}\nA few months after the promotion's 2001 demise, ECW resurfaced as a stable as part of the World Wrestling Federation Invasion storyline. On the July 9, 2001, edition of ''Raw'' Paul Heyman, who had been hired by the WWF while ECW was still in bankruptcy proceedings, joined several former ECW alumni on the WWF roster (including the debuting Rob Van Dam and Tommy Dreamer) and claimed that he was bringing ECW back to participate in the Invasion by themselves. (At the time, however, the ownership of ECW, including the use of its name on-air, was disputed despite Heyman still technically owning the company when he jumped ship to the WWF. In addition, WWF faced legal action by [[Harry Slash & The Slashtones]] for the use of the song \"This Is Extreme!\" which was eventually settled).\n\nBefore ''Raw'' was over that evening Heyman and [[Shane McMahon]], who had ([[kayfabe]]) purchased [[World Championship Wrestling]] (WCW), revealed that they were in cahoots with each other and that Heyman had (also kayfabe) sold ECW to [[Stephanie McMahon]], forming [[The Alliance (professional wrestling)|The Alliance]] to try and wrestle power from Vince McMahon. At that time, the inter-promotional feud shifted into an internal power struggle among the McMahon family. The defection of WWF superstars to The Alliance continued the shift as less focus was placed on WCW and ECW performers\u2014 in fact, with rare exceptions such as Van Dam, the ECW alumni in The Alliance were given even less focus than WCW's performers. The feud lasted six months and concluded with WWF defeating The Alliance at the 2001 [[Survivor Series (2001)|Survivor Series]]. The WWF's victory also marked the end of the Invasion storyline, and WCW and ECW wrestlers were reintegrated into the WWF.\n\n===Documentaries===\nOn January 28, 2003<ref>https://www.scribd.com/doc/305765539/WWE-acquires-ECW-Assets-HHG-Corporation</ref>, World Wrestling Entertainment Inc. purchased ECW's assets from HHG Corporation in court, acquiring the rights to ECW's video library. They used this video library to put together a two-disc [[DVD]] titled ''[[The Rise and Fall of ECW]]''. The set was released in November 2004. The main feature of the DVD was a near three-hour documentary on the company's history, with the other disc featuring 7 matches from the promotion. An unauthorized DVD called ''[[Forever Hardcore]]'' was written, directed and produced by former WCW crew member [[Jeremy Borash]] in response to ''The Rise and Fall of ECW''. The DVD had stories of wrestlers who were not employed by WWE telling their side of ECW's history.  During the week of November 10, 2014, WWE had ECW Week on the [[WWE Network]] featuring the ''ECW Exposed'' special hosted by Joey Styles and Paul Heyman.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pwinsider.com/article/89496/complete-ecw-exposed-report-heyman-and-styles-reunite-to-discuss-extreme-championship-wrestling.html?p=1|title=Complete ECW Exposed Report: Heyman and Styles Reunite to Discuss Extreme Championship Wrestling|last=Johnson|first=Mike|publisher=Pro Wrestling Insider}}</ref>\n\n===Reunions and relaunch===\n\n====WWE====\n{{Main|ECW (WWE brand)}}\nBy 2005, WWE began reintroducing ECW through content from the ECW [[WWE Video Library|video library]] and a series of books, which included the release of ''[[The Rise and Fall of ECW]]'' documentary.<ref name=\"wwe58\">{{cite book|last1=Shields|first1=Brian|last2=Sullivan|first2=Kevin|title=WWE: History of WrestleMania|year=2009|page=58}}</ref> With heightened and rejuvenated interest in the ECW franchise, WWE organized [[ECW One Night Stand (2005)|ECW One Night Stand]] on June 12, a reunion event that featured [[List of Extreme Championship Wrestling alumni|ECW alumni]].<ref name=\"wwe58\"/> Shane McMahon had the idea of an online, low budget show, but they asked TV stations and PPV producers and they were interested in ECW.<ref name=\"PaulHeymanDVD1\">{{cite DVD|title=Ladies and Gentleman, My Name is Paul Heyman Disc 1|publisher=WWE}}</ref> Due to the financial and critical success of the production, WWE produced the second [[ECW One Night Stand (2006)|ECW One Night Stand]] on June 11, 2006, which served as the [[premiere|premiere event]] in the relaunch of the ECW franchise as a [[WWE Brand Extension|WWE brand]], complementary to [[WWE Raw|Raw]] and [[WWE SmackDown|SmackDown]].<ref name=SciFi>{{cite web|title=WWE brings ECW to Sci Fi Channel|publisher=WWE|url=http://www.wwe.com/shows/ecw/scifi|accessdate=2006-06-02}}</ref> On June 13, [[Paul Heyman]], former ECW owner and newly appointed figurehead for the [[ECW (WWE brand)|ECW brand]], recommissioned the [[ECW World Heavyweight Championship]] to be the brand's world title and awarded it to [[Rob Van Dam]] as a result of winning the [[WWE Championship]] at One Night Stand 2006.

In 1993, [[Scarsdale, New York]] native and businessman [[Paul Heyman]] took over the creative end of the promotion from Eddie Gilbert and rechristened the promotion from Eastern Championship Wrestling to \"Extreme\" Championship Wrestling. The promotion showcased various international styles of professional wrestling, ranging from [[lucha libre]] to [[puroresu]] and [[hardcore wrestling]]. Heyman's creative direction created new stars, and established the \"third\" big brand in the United States, competing with the billionaire-backed [[WWE|World Wrestling Federation]] and [[World Championship Wrestling]] promotions. HHG closed ECW in 2001 when it was unable to secure a new national television contract, and World Wrestling Entertainment, Inc. purchased the assets of the company from bankruptcy in January 2003.\n\nAfter purchasing the assets of ECW, WWE relaunched the Extreme Championship Wrestling franchise as a [[WWE Brand Extension|third brand]] with their existing [[Raw (WWE brand)|Raw]] and [[SmackDown (WWE brand)|SmackDown]] brands.

NWA President Dennis Coralluzzo alleged that Crockett and Gordon were going to try to monopolize the title<ref>[http://www.angelfire.com/wrestling3/keysplace/nwa.html History of the National Wrestling Alliance]</ref> (akin to Crockett's actions in the 1980s) and stated Crockett did not have the NWA board's approval, which resulted in Coralluzzo personally overseeing the tournament. Gordon took offense at Coralluzzo for his power plays and began contemplating a plan to secede ECW from the NWA through a controversial and public manner that would attract attention to ECW and insult the NWA organization. Gordon planned to have [[Shane Douglas]], who was scheduled to face [[2 Cold Scorpio]] in the tournament finals on August 30, 1994, throw down the NWA World Heavyweight Championship belt upon winning as an act of defiance.<ref>[http://www.wrestlingepicenter.com/shows/ShaneDouglas/ Shane Douglas on throwing down the title]</ref><ref name=\"2006 Hall Of Fame Inductees\">[http://www.wrestlingclothesline.com/HallOfFameDennis.htm 2006 Hall Of Fame Inductees]</ref>\n\nTod Gordon and Paul Heyman originally planned the idea of throwing down the NWA World Heavyweight Championship belt. Heyman persuaded Douglas by noting that the negative would only be that NWA traditionalists would just see them as traitors to tradition. Adding to Douglas' decision was the animosity between Douglas and NWA President Dennis Coralluzzo, who at the time publicly criticized Douglas and told NWA affiliated bookers not to book Douglas for shows. Coralluzzo believed that Douglas was a \"bad risk\" and had the tendency to [[no-show (professional wrestling)|no-show]] events.<ref>[http://www.wrestlingepicenter.com/shows/ShaneDouglas/ Douglas on Coralluzzo]</ref> Douglas ultimately decided to go through with Gordon and Heyman's plan, inspired by his father's [[motto]] of \"doing right by the people that do right by you.\" After looking up and saying, \"This is it tonight, Dad,\" Douglas threw down the NWA World Heavyweight Championship belt, stating that he did not want to be champion of a \"dead promotion\" that \"died seven years ago.\" <ref name=\"HardcoreHistory\"/> He then raised the Eastern Championship Wrestling title belt and declared it to be a [[World Heavyweight Championship (professional wrestling)|World Heavyweight Championship]] \u2014 calling it the only real world title left in professional wrestling. When recalling this event years later, Paul Heyman stated the following in a 1998 chat:\n\n:{{cquote|The National Wrestling Alliance was old-school when old-school wasn't hip anymore. We wanted to set our mark, we wanted to breakaway from the pack, we wanted to let the world know that we weren't just some independent promotion.<ref name=\"shaggs\"/>}}\n\nCoralluzzo was interviewed after the event and declared that Douglas would be the world champion of the NWA \"whether he likes it or not\", calling Douglas' actions a \"disgrace\" and said he would move to have Douglas stripped of both the NWA World Heavyweight Championship and the Eastern Championship Wrestling Heavyweight Championship, calling him \"undeserving\" of both titles.<ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6W_slOrFvuQ \"Tod Gordon Announces Birth of Extreme\".]</ref> Gordon made the following announcement on the next edition of NWA-ECW programming:\n\n{{cquote|I listened with great interest as the representative of the NWA board of directors took it upon himself to inform you that they have the power to force NWA-Eastern Championship Wrestling not to recognize The Franchise, Shane Douglas, as a world heavyweight champion. Well, as of noon today, I have folded NWA-Eastern Championship Wrestling. In its place will be ECW- ''Extreme'' Championship Wrestling- and we recognize The Franchise, Shane Douglas, as our World Heavyweight Champion. And we encourage any wrestler in the world today to come to the ECW to challenge for that belt. This is the ECW, Extreme Championship Wrestling, changing the face of professional wrestling.}}\n\nThe promotion showcased many different styles of professional wrestling, including [[hardcore wrestling]] matches as well as [[lucha libre]] and [[puroresu|Japanese wrestling]] styles.\n\n===ECW Arena and television syndication (1994\u20132001)===\n{{See also|ECW Hardcore TV}}\nThe bulk of ECW's shows remained at the [[2300 Arena|ECW Arena]], a former warehouse secluded under a section of [[Interstate 95 in Pennsylvania|Interstate 95]]. Seating comprised simple folding chairs and four sets of portable bleachers, with the unconventional scene reflective of the gritty style of the promotion itself. Shows were broadcast on a Philadelphia local cable sports station ([[SportsChannel America]]'s local affiliate, [[SportsChannel Philadelphia]]) on Tuesday evenings. After Sports Channel Philadelphia went off the air in 1997, the show moved to [[WPPX|WPPX-TV 61]]. It later moved to a former independent broadcast station ([[WGTW-TV|WGTW]] 48) in Philadelphia on either Friday or Saturday night at 1 or 2 a.m. Shows were also aired on the [[MSG (TV network)|MSG Network]] in NYC on Friday nights (Early Saturday morning) at 2 a.m. Due to the obscurity of the stations and ECW itself, as well as the lack of [[Federal Communications Commission|FCC]] oversight at that late hour, many times expletives and violence were not edited out of these showings, along with extensive use of copyrighted music and music videos.\n\n===Paul Heyman and cross promotion with the WWF and the USWA (1996\u20131997)===\nIn 1995, [[Tod Gordon]] sold Extreme Championship Wrestling, Inc., to his head [[Professional wrestling booker|booker]], [[Paul Heyman]], trading as HHG Corporation. Afterward, Gordon remained in ECW as a figurehead commissioner. Years after being the ECW \"Commissioner\", Gordon left ECW in May 1997, his absence was explained on-air that he retired from wrestling due to family. Rumors circulated, however, that Gordon was fired by Heyman after he was suspected as a \"locker room mole\" for a rival wrestling promotion, helping to lure talent to World Championship Wrestling.\n\nStoryline-wise, [[Vince McMahon]] first became \"aware\" of ECW while at the 1995 [[King of the Ring (1995)|King of the Ring]] event in ECW's home base of Philadelphia. During the match between [[Viscera (wrestler)|Mabel]] and [[Savio Vega]], the crowd suddenly started to chant, \"ECW ECW ECW!\". On September 22, 1996, at the [[In Your House 10: Mind Games|In Your House: Mind Games]] event in Philadelphia, ECW stars [[The Sandman (wrestler)|The Sandman]], [[Tommy Dreamer]], Paul Heyman, and [[Tazz|Taz]] were in the front row with Sandman even interfering in one match (when he threw beer on Savio Vega during his strap match with [[John Layfield|Bradshaw]]). McMahon acknowledged ECW's status as a local, up and coming promotion on the air. The following night on WWF ''Monday Night RAW'', broadcast on September 23, 1996, at the onset of a match between The Bodydonnas vs. The British Bulldog and Owen Hart, Bill Alfonso, and Tazz could be seen invading the program. Both Tazz and Alfonso were able to successfully jump the security rails, and Tazz was able to prominently display a bright orange sign with black lettering that read \"[[Sabu (wrestler)|Sabu]] Fears Tazz-ECW\". On February 24, 1997, ECW \"invaded\" ''Raw'' from the [[Manhattan Center]]. They advanced a storyline, plugged their first ever pay-per-view and worked three matches in front of the WWF audience while McMahon called the action with both Jerry \"The King\" Lawler and Paul Heyman. The Manhattan Center in [[New York City|New York]] was peppered with a large number of ECW fans, who gave the WWF wrestlers \"Boring!\" chants when they felt it was warranted. Likewise, when the ECW performers arrived, they [[Pop (professional wrestling)|popped]] and introduced the WWF Monday night audience to some trademark ECW group chants. This invasion sparked an inter-promotional feud between ECW and Lawler's [[United States Wrestling Association]]. Lawler disparaged ECW on-camera and convinced wrestlers such as [[Rob Van Dam]] and Sabu to join him in an anti-ECW crusade. Throughout 1997, ECW wrestlers appeared on USWA television programs, and vice versa. As part of the working relationship between ECW and the WWF, a number of WWF-contracted wrestlers were sent to ECW for seasoning in 1997, including [[Darren Drozdov|Droz]] and [[Achim Albrecht|Brakkus]].<ref name=\"Torch28Dec02\">{{cite web|url=http://pwtorch.com/artman2/publish/Torch_Flashbacks_19/article_2016.shtml|date=December 28, 2002|title=5 Yrs Ago: ECW News - GnR's Slash, Jenna Jameson no-show PPV|author=Powell, Jason|publisher=[[Pro Wrestling Torch Newsletter|Pro Wrestling Torch]]|accessdate=2012-09-24}}</ref><ref name=\"Torch21Nov04\">{{cite web|url=http://pwtorch.com/artman2/publish/WWE_News_3/article_10870.shtml|date=November 21, 2004|title=Interview Highlights: Heyman on WCW, NWA-TNA, being on WWF payroll in 1996|author=Powell, Jason|publisher=[[Pro Wrestling Torch Newsletter|Pro Wrestling Torch]]|accessdate=2012-09-24}}</ref>\n\nOn April 13, 1997 ECW broadcast their first pay-per-view (PPV) wrestling card [[ECW Barely Legal|Barely Legal]], highlighted by [[Terry Funk]] defeating [[Raven (wrestler)|Raven]] to win the ECW World Heavyweight Championship. In June 1997, the company's [[ECW Wrestlepalooza#1997|Wrestlepalooza '97]] event featured Raven's final ECW match before leaving for WCW. In this match, Tommy Dreamer finally beat Raven, his longtime nemesis. Dreamer's celebration was short-lived, though, as Jerry Lawler, along with Sabu and Rob Van Dam showed up to attack Dreamer. This set up a match between Dreamer and Lawler at the pay-per-view, [[Hardcore Heaven#1997|1997 Hardcore Heaven]], on August 17, which was won by Dreamer. ECW continued through 1998 and early 1999 with a string of successful pay-per-views.\n\n===Mike Awesome controversy and promotional rivalry (2000)===\nIn April 2000, [[Mike Awesome]] made a surprise appearance on ''[[WCW Monday Nitro]]'' \u2013 making his debut by attacking [[Kevin Nash]] \u2013 while still reigning as [[ECW World Heavyweight Championship|ECW World Heavyweight Champion]]. Mike Awesome's friend [[Lance Storm]] has said that Awesome refused to sign a new contract with ECW until Paul Heyman paid him overdue wages.<ref>{{cite web|last=Evers|first= Lance|title=Mike Awesome 1965-2007|date=2007-02-20|publisher=StormWrestling|url=http://www.stormwrestling.com/022007.html}}</ref> There were rumors that WCW Executive Vice-President Eric Bischoff wanted Awesome to drop the ECW World Championship belt in the trash can on television, as had been done previously with the [[WWE Women's Championship (1956\u20132010)|WWF Women's title]] by [[Debrah Miceli|Madusa]] when she jumped from the WWF to WCW. After Paul Heyman filed an injunction, WCW refrained from having Awesome appear on ''Nitro'' with the belt, but did acknowledge him as the champion. Eventually, a compromise was reached. Awesome (a WCW employee and the reigning ECW World Heavyweight champion) appeared at an April 13, 2000 ECW event in [[Indianapolis|Indianapolis, Indiana]],<ref>{{cite web|last=Molinaro|first=John F.|title=Tazz wins ECW World title|date=2000-04-14|publisher=Slam!

At the time Los Angeles was home to [[Xtreme Pro Wrestling]] (XPW), and its owner [[Rob Zicari|Rob Black]] purchased six front row tickets for the show. The tickets were given to a cadre of XPW talent, and their mission was to make it clear that ECW was on enemy turf. This was not a storyline. At the beginning of the main event, the XPW contingent donned shirts emblazoned with the XPW logo, gaining the attention of security and ECW wrestler Tommy Dreamer. Security ejected the XPW group from the building and later, a brawl broke out in the parking lot between members of the XPW ring crew and the ECW locker room. The XPW wrestlers were not involved in the fracas, during which the ECW wrestlers brutalized the XPW ring crew with several of the ring crew members left in pools of their own blood.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.trashtalkingradio.com/tt/2005/tt06-28-05b.ram |title=trashtalkingradio |access-date=2007-09-02 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110717093437/http://www.trashtalkingradio.com/tt/2005/tt06-28-05b.ram |archive-date=2011-07-17 |url-status=dead }}</ref> Initial reports claimed that XPW valet [[Kristi Myst]] had somehow touched ECW valet [[Francine Fournier]] and that this is what prompted the incident, but Fournier herself has since gone on record as saying that she was never grabbed or in any other way touched by any of the XPW crew, and other eyewitnesses support the story that Fournier never had a hand laid on her. XPW was not acknowledged by ECW announcer [[Joey Styles]] during the pay-per-view telecast, however at the November to Remember pay-per-view a few months later, color-commentator [[Don Callis]] made a subtle reference to the incident, describing a wild brawl as \"looking like a Los Angeles parking lot\". The XPW contingent at ringside consisted of wrestlers [[The Messiah (wrestler)|The Messiah]], Kid Kaos, Supreme, Kristi Myst, Homeless Jimmy and XPW announcer Kris Kloss.\n\n===''ECW on TNN'' and decline (1999\u20132001)===\n{{Main|ECW on TNN}}\nIn August 1999, ECW began to broadcast nationally on [[The Nashville Network|TNN]] (for what was initially a three-year contract). Despite no advertising and a low budget, ECW became TNN's highest [[Nielsen ratings|rated]] show. ''ECW on TNN'' was cancelled in October 2000 (with the final episode airing on October 6, 2000) in favor of ''[[WWE Raw|WWF Raw]]'' moving to the network. Paul Heyman stated he believed that the inability to land another national television deal was the cause of ECW's demise.<ref name=riseDVD>{{cite video|title=The Rise and Fall of ECW|medium=DVD|publisher=[[WWE|World Wrestling Entertainment]]|date=2004}}</ref>\n\nECW struggled for months after the cancellation, trying to secure a new national TV deal. On December 30, 2000, ''[[ECW Hardcore TV]]'' aired for the last time and the January 7, 2001, broadcast of [[ECW Guilty as Charged#2001|Guilty as Charged]] was the company/s last PPV. [[Living Dangerously]] was scheduled to air on March 11, 2001, but because of financial trouble it was cancelled in February.<ref name=BetweenTheRopes>{{cite book|title=Between the Ropes: Wrestling's Greatest Triumphs and Failures|last1=Fritz|first1=Brian|last2=Murray|first2=Christopher|publisher=[[ECW Press]]|year=2006|isbn=978-1-55022-726-0}}</ref> Heyman could not get out of financial trouble and ECW closed on April 4, 2001.<ref name=BetweenTheRopes/><ref>{{cite book|title=The Rise and Fall of ECW|last=Loverro|first=Thom|page=[https://archive.org/details/risefallofecw00thom/page/233 233]|publisher=[[Pocket Books]]|year=2006|isbn=978-1-4165-1058-1|url=https://archive.org/details/risefallofecw00thom/page/233}}</ref> Heyman supposedly had never told his wrestlers that the company was on its dying legs and was unable to pay them for a while.\n\nThe company was listed as having assets totaling [[United States dollar|$]]1,385,500. Included in that number was $860,000 in accounts receivable owed the company by [[In Demand]] Network (PPV), [[Acclaim Entertainment|Acclaim]] ([[video game]]s), and Original San Francisco Toy Company ([[action figure]]s). The balance of the assets were the video tape library ($500,000), a 1998 [[Ford Motor Company|Ford Truck]] ($19,500) and the remaining inventory of merchandise ($4). The liabilities of the company totaled $8,881,435.17. Wrestlers and talent were listed, with amounts owed ranging from $2 for Sabu and [[Steve Corino]] to hundreds, and in some cases, thousands of dollars. The highest amounts owed to talents were [[Rob Van Dam]] ($150,000),<ref name=\"HardcoreHistory\"/><ref name=BetweenTheRopes/> Shane Douglas ($145,000),<ref>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHANWlcQPg&t=474s</ref> Tommy Dreamer ($100,000),<ref name=BetweenTheRopes/> [[Joey Styles]] ($50,480),<ref name=\"HardcoreHistory\"/><ref name=BetweenTheRopes/> [[Rhyno]] ($50,000),<ref name=\"HardcoreHistory\"/><ref name=BetweenTheRopes/> and Francine Fournier ($47,275).<ref name=\"HardcoreHistory\"/><ref name=BetweenTheRopes/> These assets were eventually purchased by World Wrestling Entertainment Inc. On January 28, 2003<ref>https://www.scribd.com/doc/305765539/WWE-acquires-ECW-Assets-HHG-Corporation</ref>, World Wrestling Entertainment Inc. purchased ECW's assets from HHG Corporation in court, acquiring the rights to ECW's video library.\n\n==Legacy and resurface==\n\nIn ECW, there were virtually no rules. The role of referees only included counting pinfalls, acknowledging submissions, and upholding rope breaks. ECW was known for making popular several types of matches, including the [[Three Way Dance|3-Way Dance]], [[Hardcore wrestling|Barbed wire match]], [[WarGames match|Ultimate Jeopardy steel cage match]], [[Tables match|Flaming Tables match]], and [[Professional wrestling match types#Weapon-based variations|Singapore Cane match]] among others.\n\nThe \"Big Two\" (World Championship Wrestling and the World Wrestling Federation) began hiring away their talent. ECW, according to Heyman, was the first victim of the \"[[Monday Night Wars]]\" between ''[[WCW Monday Nitro]]'' and ''[[WWE Raw|Monday Night Raw]]''. The WWF had a working relationship with ECW, going so far as to participate in cross-promotional angles, providing talent on loan in exchange for developed young talent and marketable gimmicks (Al Snow's \"head\" gimmick among them), and even providing financial aid to Heyman for a considerable period of time. WCW on the other hand, refused to even mention ECW by name (with a few notable exceptions; including a passing remark by [[Raven (wrestler)|Raven]] in late 1997 and [[Kevin Nash]] and [[Scott Hall (wrestler)|Scott Hall]] mentioning it as a viable second option in American wrestling in a slight on their main competition, the World Wrestling Federation). It was referred to as \"barbed wire city\" and \"a major [[Independent circuit|independent]] promotion that wrestled in bingo halls\" during a segment directed at [[Diamond Dallas Page]].\n\n===The Alliance===\n{{Main|The Invasion (professional wrestling)}}\nA few months after the promotion's 2001 demise, ECW resurfaced as a stable as part of the World Wrestling Federation Invasion storyline. On the July 9, 2001, edition of ''Raw'' Paul Heyman, who had been hired by the WWF while ECW was still in bankruptcy proceedings, joined several former ECW alumni on the WWF roster (including the debuting Rob Van Dam and Tommy Dreamer) and claimed that he was bringing ECW back to participate in the Invasion by themselves. (At the time, however, the ownership of ECW, including the use of its name on-air, was disputed despite Heyman still technically owning the company when he jumped ship to the WWF. In addition, WWF faced legal action by [[Harry Slash & The Slashtones]] for the use of the song \"This Is Extreme!\" which was eventually settled).\n\nBefore ''Raw'' was over that evening Heyman and [[Shane McMahon]], who had ([[kayfabe]]) purchased [[World Championship Wrestling]] (WCW), revealed that they were in cahoots with each other and that Heyman had (also kayfabe) sold ECW to [[Stephanie McMahon]], forming [[The Alliance (professional wrestling)|The Alliance]] to try and wrestle power from Vince McMahon. At that time, the inter-promotional feud shifted into an internal power struggle among the McMahon family. The defection of WWF superstars to The Alliance continued the shift as less focus was placed on WCW and ECW performers\u2014 in fact, with rare exceptions such as Van Dam, the ECW alumni in The Alliance were given even less focus than WCW's performers. The feud lasted six months and concluded with WWF defeating The Alliance at the 2001 [[Survivor Series (2001)|Survivor Series]]. The WWF's victory also marked the end of the Invasion storyline, and WCW and ECW wrestlers were reintegrated into the WWF.\n\n===Documentaries===\nOn January 28, 2003<ref>https://www.scribd.com/doc/305765539/WWE-acquires-ECW-Assets-HHG-Corporation</ref>, World Wrestling Entertainment Inc. purchased ECW's assets from HHG Corporation in court, acquiring the rights to ECW's video library. They used this video library to put together a two-disc [[DVD]] titled ''[[The Rise and Fall of ECW]]''. The set was released in November 2004. The main feature of the DVD was a near three-hour documentary on the company's history, with the other disc featuring 7 matches from the promotion. An unauthorized DVD called ''[[Forever Hardcore]]'' was written, directed and produced by former WCW crew member [[Jeremy Borash]] in response to ''The Rise and Fall of ECW''. The DVD had stories of wrestlers who were not employed by WWE telling their side of ECW's history.  During the week of November 10, 2014, WWE had ECW Week on the [[WWE Network]] featuring the ''ECW Exposed'' special hosted by Joey Styles and Paul Heyman.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pwinsider.com/article/89496/complete-ecw-exposed-report-heyman-and-styles-reunite-to-discuss-extreme-championship-wrestling.html?p=1|title=Complete ECW Exposed Report: Heyman and Styles Reunite to Discuss Extreme Championship Wrestling|last=Johnson|first=Mike|publisher=Pro Wrestling Insider}}</ref>\n\n===Reunions and relaunch===\n\n====WWE====\n{{Main|ECW (WWE brand)}}\nBy 2005, WWE began reintroducing ECW through content from the ECW [[WWE Video Library|video library]] and a series of books, which included the release of ''[[The Rise and Fall of ECW]]'' documentary.<ref name=\"wwe58\">{{cite book|last1=Shields|first1=Brian|last2=Sullivan|first2=Kevin|title=WWE: History of WrestleMania|year=2009|page=58}}</ref> With heightened and rejuvenated interest in the ECW franchise, WWE organized [[ECW One Night Stand (2005)|ECW One Night Stand]] on June 12, a reunion event that featured [[List of Extreme Championship Wrestling alumni|ECW alumni]].<ref name=\"wwe58\"/> Shane McMahon had the idea of an online, low budget show, but they asked TV stations and PPV producers and they were interested in ECW.<ref name=\"PaulHeymanDVD1\">{{cite DVD|title=Ladies and Gentleman, My Name is Paul Heyman Disc 1|publisher=WWE}}</ref> Due to the financial and critical success of the production, WWE produced the second [[ECW One Night Stand (2006)|ECW One Night Stand]] on June 11, 2006, which served as the [[premiere|premiere event]] in the relaunch of the ECW franchise as a [[WWE Brand Extension|WWE brand]], complementary to [[WWE Raw|Raw]] and [[WWE SmackDown|SmackDown]].<ref name=SciFi>{{cite web|title=WWE brings ECW to Sci Fi Channel|publisher=WWE|url=http://www.wwe.com/shows/ecw/scifi|accessdate=2006-06-02}}</ref> On June 13, [[Paul Heyman]], former ECW owner and newly appointed figurehead for the [[ECW (WWE brand)|ECW brand]], recommissioned the [[ECW World Heavyweight Championship]] to be the brand's world title and awarded it to [[Rob Van Dam]] as a result of winning the [[WWE Championship]] at One Night Stand 2006.

Under the WWE banner, ECW was presented following the same format of the other brands, with match rules, such as [[Countout|count outs]] and [[Professional wrestling#Disqualification|disqualifications]], being standard. Matches featuring the rule set of the ECW promotion were classified as being contested under \"[[Hardcore wrestling|Extreme Rules]]\" and were only fought when specified.\n\n====Other reunions====\nOn the same weekend as the ECW One Night Stand 2005 event another reunion show was held at the [[The Arena (Philadelphia)|ECW Arena]].

Tropical and subtropical cyclones in this basin are monitored by the [[Regional Specialised Meteorological Centre]] in [[R\u00e9union]].\n\nFor the second consecutive year in a row, the first system formed before the official start of the season. Afterwards, two storms formed in the month of December: [[Cyclone Belna]] on 2 December, which brought flooding and strong wind to northwestern [[Madagascar]], as well as Very Intense Tropical Cyclone Ambali, which formed a day later. Ambali was the first very intense tropical cyclone in the basin since [[Cyclone Fantala|Fantala]] in 2016. \n__TOC__\n{{clear}}\n\n==Seasonal forecasts==\nThe season began with one of the strongest positive phases of the [[Indian Ocean Dipole]] (IOD) in the past 40 years. [[M\u00e9t\u00e9o-France|M\u00e9t\u00e9o-France R\u00e9union]] expects that the positive anomalies will decay slowly throughout austral summer, having a prominent impact on the cyclone season through mid-February. As a result, storm activity was not forecast to begin until December&mdash;the month in which the monsoonal flow becomes established in the western half of the basin (the dry conditions in the central and eastern Indian Ocean induced by the IOD would prevent typical early-season storms). With warm and wet conditions expected in the western Indian Ocean, cyclone formation is expected to be enhanced west of 70\u00b0E.<ref name=\"mfroutlook\">{{cite report |title=Pr\u00e9vision saisonni\u00e8re d\u2019activit\u00e9 cyclonique dans le Sud-Ouest de l'oc\u00e9an Indien : Saison 2019-2020. |url=http://www.meteofrance.re/documents/3714872/28998514/CP_previ_saison_cyclone_2019-2020.pdf |website=PREVISION SAISONNIERE ACTIVITE CYCLONIQUE SWIO 2019-2020 |publisher=M\u00e9t\u00e9o-France La R\u00e9union |accessdate=6 December 2019 |location=Saint-Denis, R\u00e9union |language=French |format=PDF}}</ref>\n\nA near-average eight to eleven storms are expected throughout the course of the season, with the possibility of a higher than average number of these attaining Tropical Cyclone strength with winds of {{convert|120|km/h|mph|0|abbr=on}} or greater as a result of favorable upper-level divergence in the western region of the basin.

The disturbance failed to organise into a tropical depression and dissipated on 25 July. Tropical activity came to a halt until 2 December when Tropical Disturbance 02 formed. A day later, Tropical Depression 03 formed and was later named Ambali. On 5 December, Tropical Storm Ambali rapidly intensified, becoming the first very intense tropical cyclone since [[Cyclone Fantala|Fantala]] in 2016. Tropical Disturbance 02 then became Belna, and Belna continued to intensify into a Severe Tropical Storm. Belna then intensified into a cyclone, equivalent to a category 3 hurricane before making landfall in northwestern Madagascar as a category 2 hurricane-equivalent storm, leaving significant damages and 9 deaths. In late December, tropical storm Calvinia formed. It persisted into 2020. Activity was quiet for three weeks. On 19 January, a tropical depression formed, but soon dissipated without being named. Two tropical storms formed in late January, Diane and Esami. They also both dissipated without reaching tropical cyclone status. In early February, another tropical depression formed. It eventually intensified into a tropical storm and was named Francisco. Francisco degenerated into a remnant low several days after formation. In mid-February, the storm regenerated into a tropical depression. At the same time, another disturbance formed, and would strengthen into Tropical Storm Gabekile. It wasn't long until Gabekile strengthened into a tropical cyclone. However, it quickly weakened. By 19 February, Gabekile had dissipated. Nearly a month later, Moderate Tropical Storm Herold formed. On 14 March, [[Cyclone Herold|Herold]] strengthened into a severe tropical storm. Herold then rapidly intensified to become the season's 2nd Intense Tropical Cyclone.  Shortly after, it rapidly weakened as it moved southwards before dissipating. In early April, Moderate tropical storm Irondro formed.\n\n==Systems==\n===Zone of Disturbed Weather 01===\n{{Infobox tropical cyclone small\n|Basin=SWI\n|Image=01R 2019-07-23 0900Z.jpg\n|Track=01R 2019 track.png\n|Formed=22 July\n|Dissipated=25 July\n|10-min winds=25\n|Pressure=1001\n|Type1=ZODW\n}}\n\nIn mid-July, a broad wind circulation developed over the central Indian Ocean, accompanied by deep [[convection (meteorology)|convection]].

Ocean cyclone season''' is a current event of the annual cycle of [[tropical cyclone]] and [[subtropical cyclone]] formation. The season officially began on 15&nbsp;November, however, the formation of the first system&mdash;Zone of Disturbed Weather 01&mdash;occurred on 22&nbsp;July 2019, well before the official start of the season. It will end on 30 April 2020, with the exception of [[Mauritius]] and the [[Seychelles]], for which it will end on 15 May 2020. These dates conventionally delimit the period of each year when most tropical and subtropical cyclones form in the basin, which is west of [[longitude|90\u00b0E]] and south of the [[Equator]]. Tropical and subtropical cyclones in this basin are monitored by the [[Regional Specialised Meteorological Centre]] in [[R\u00e9union]].\n\nFor the second consecutive year in a row, the first system formed before the official start of the season. Afterwards, two storms formed in the month of December: [[Cyclone Belna]] on 2 December, which brought flooding and strong wind to northwestern [[Madagascar]], as well as Very Intense Tropical Cyclone Ambali, which formed a day later. Ambali was the first very intense tropical cyclone in the basin since [[Cyclone Fantala|Fantala]] in 2016. \n__TOC__\n{{clear}}\n\n==Seasonal forecasts==\nThe season began with one of the strongest positive phases of the [[Indian Ocean Dipole]] (IOD) in the past 40 years. [[M\u00e9t\u00e9o-France|M\u00e9t\u00e9o-France R\u00e9union]] expects that the positive anomalies will decay slowly throughout austral summer, having a prominent impact on the cyclone season through mid-February. As a result, storm activity was not forecast to begin until December&mdash;the month in which the monsoonal flow becomes established in the western half of the basin (the dry conditions in the central and eastern Indian Ocean induced by the IOD would prevent typical early-season storms). With warm and wet conditions expected in the western Indian Ocean, cyclone formation is expected to be enhanced west of 70\u00b0E.<ref name=\"mfroutlook\">{{cite report |title=Pr\u00e9vision saisonni\u00e8re d\u2019activit\u00e9 cyclonique dans le Sud-Ouest de l'oc\u00e9an Indien : Saison 2019-2020. |url=http://www.meteofrance.re/documents/3714872/28998514/CP_previ_saison_cyclone_2019-2020.pdf |website=PREVISION SAISONNIERE ACTIVITE CYCLONIQUE SWIO 2019-2020 |publisher=M\u00e9t\u00e9o-France La R\u00e9union |accessdate=6 December 2019 |location=Saint-Denis, R\u00e9union |language=French |format=PDF}}</ref>\n\nA near-average eight to eleven storms are expected throughout the course of the season, with the possibility of a higher than average number of these attaining Tropical Cyclone strength with winds of {{convert|120|km/h|mph|0|abbr=on}} or greater as a result of favorable upper-level divergence in the western region of the basin.

The disturbance failed to organise into a tropical depression and dissipated on 25 July. Tropical activity came to a halt until 2 December when Tropical Disturbance 02 formed. A day later, Tropical Depression 03 formed and was later named Ambali. On 5 December, Tropical Storm Ambali rapidly intensified, becoming the first very intense tropical cyclone since [[Cyclone Fantala|Fantala]] in 2016. Tropical Disturbance 02 then became Belna, and Belna continued to intensify into a Severe Tropical Storm. Belna then intensified into a cyclone, equivalent to a category 3 hurricane before making landfall in northwestern Madagascar as a category 2 hurricane-equivalent storm, leaving significant damages and 9 deaths. In late December, tropical storm Calvinia formed. It persisted into 2020. Activity was quiet for three weeks. On 19 January, a tropical depression formed, but soon dissipated without being named. Two tropical storms formed in late January, Diane and Esami. They also both dissipated without reaching tropical cyclone status. In early February, another tropical depression formed. It eventually intensified into a tropical storm and was named Francisco. Francisco degenerated into a remnant low several days after formation. In mid-February, the storm regenerated into a tropical depression. At the same time, another disturbance formed, and would strengthen into Tropical Storm Gabekile. It wasn't long until Gabekile strengthened into a tropical cyclone. However, it quickly weakened. By 19 February, Gabekile had dissipated. Nearly a month later, Moderate Tropical Storm Herold formed. On 14 March, [[Cyclone Herold|Herold]] strengthened into a severe tropical storm. Herold then rapidly intensified to become the season's 2nd Intense Tropical Cyclone.  Shortly after, it rapidly weakened as it moved southwards before dissipating. In early April, Moderate tropical storm Irondro formed.\n\n==Systems==\n===Zone of Disturbed Weather 01===\n{{Infobox tropical cyclone small\n|Basin=SWI\n|Image=01R 2019-07-23 0900Z.jpg\n|Track=01R 2019 track.png\n|Formed=22 July\n|Dissipated=25 July\n|10-min winds=25\n|Pressure=1001\n|Type1=ZODW\n}}\n\nIn mid-July, a broad wind circulation developed over the central Indian Ocean, accompanied by deep [[convection (meteorology)|convection]].
