He described the piece as a \"rhapsodic ballet\" because it was written freely and is more modern than his previous works. Gershwin explained in ''[[Musical America]]'', \"My purpose here is to portray the impressions of an American visitor in Paris as he strolls about the city, listens to the various street noises, and absorbs the French atmosphere.\"<ref name=\"Pollack2007\">{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RySwdc151ZoC&pg=PA431|title=George Gershwin: His Life and Work|author=Howard Pollack|authorlink=Howard Pollack|date=January 15, 2007|publisher=University of California Press|isbn=978-0-520-93314-9|location=|pages=119, 431\u2013440}}</ref>\n\nThe piece is structured into five sections, which culminate in a loose [[Ternary form|ABA format]]. Gershwin's first A episode introduces the two main \"walking\" themes in the \"Allegretto grazioso\" and develops a third theme in the \"Subito con brio\".<ref>{{cite thesis|last=Van Dyke|first=Joseph M.|year=2011|title=George Gershwin's An American in Paris for Two Pianos: A Critical Score Study and Performance Guide|series=(Doctoral Thesis)|location=Columbus, OH|publisher=OhioLINK Electronic Theses and Dissertations Center|url=https://etd.ohiolink.edu/pg_10?0::NO:10:P10_ACCESSION_NUM:osu1298660291}}</ref> The style of this A section is written in the typical French style of composers [[Claude Debussy]] and [[Les Six]].<ref name=Burton /> This A section featured duple meter, singsong rhythms, and diatonic melodies with the sounds of oboe, English horn, and taxi horns. The B section's \"Andante ma con ritmo deciso\" introduces the American [[Blues]] and spasms of homesickness. The \"Allegro\" that follows continues to express homesickness in a faster [[twelve-bar blues]]. In the B section, Gershwin uses common time, syncopated rhythms, and bluesy melodies with the sounds of trumpet, saxophone, and snare drum. \"Moderato con grazia\" is the last A section that returns to the themes set in A. After recapitulating the \"walking\" themes, Gershwin overlays the slow blues theme from section B in the final \"Grandioso\".\n\n==Response==\nGershwin did not particularly like Walter Damrosch's interpretation at the world premiere of ''An American in Paris''. He stated that Damrosch's sluggish, dragging tempo caused him to walk out of the hall during a matinee performance of this work. The audience, according to Edward Cushing, responded with \"a demonstration of enthusiasm impressively genuine in contrast to the conventional applause which new music, good and bad, ordinarily arouses.\" Critics believed that ''An American in Paris'' was better crafted than his lukewarm [[Concerto in F (Gershwin)|Concerto in F]]. Some did not think it belonged in a program with classical composers [[C\u00e9sar Franck]], [[Richard Wagner]], or [[Guillaume Lekeu]] on its premiere. Gershwin responded to the critics, \"It's not a Beethoven Symphony, you know... It's a humorous piece, nothing solemn about it. It's not intended to draw tears. If it pleases symphony audiences as a light, jolly piece, a series of impressions musically expressed, it succeeds.\"<ref name=\"Pollack2007\" />\n\n==Instrumentation==\n''An American in Paris'' was originally scored for 3 [[flute]]s (3rd doubling on [[piccolo]]), 2 [[oboe]]s, [[English horn]], 2 [[clarinet]]s in [[soprano clarinet|B-flat]], [[bass clarinet]] in B-flat, 2 [[bassoon]]s, [[contrabassoon]], 4 [[French horn|horns]] in F, 3 [[trumpet]]s in B-flat, 3 [[trombone]]s, [[tuba]], [[timpani]], [[snare drum]], [[bass drum]], [[Triangle (musical instrument)|triangle]], [[Woodblock (instrument)|wood block]], [[Ratchet (instrument)|ratchet]], [[cymbal]]s, low and high [[Tom-tom drum|tom-toms]], [[xylophone]], [[glockenspiel]], [[celesta]], 4 [[vehicle horn|taxi horns]] labeled as A, B, C and D with circles around them, [[alto saxophone]], [[tenor saxophone]], [[baritone saxophone]], (all saxophones doubling soprano saxophones) and [[String section|strings]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://archives.nyphil.org/index.php/artifact/47d1f79a-8ea6-4aba-964f-989cb5dc2cd7/fullview#page/4/mode/2up|title=George Gershwin: An American in Paris (original score)|website=New York Philharmonic Archives|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170904200637/http://archives.nyphil.org/index.php/artifact/47d1f79a-8ea6-4aba-964f-989cb5dc2cd7/fullview#page/4/mode/2up|archive-date=September 4, 2017|url-status=dead|access-date=September 4, 2017|df=mdy-all}}</ref> Although most modern audiences have heard the taxi horns using the notes A, B, C and D, it has recently come to light<ref name=\"nytimes1\">{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/03/02/theater/have-we-been-playing-gershwin-wrong-for-70-years.html|title=Have We Been Playing Gershwin Wrong for 70 Years?|author=Michael Cooper|date=March 1, 2016|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|accessdate=April 6, 2016 }}</ref> that Gershwin's intention was to have used the notes A{{Music|flat}}<sub>[[Scientific pitch notation|4]]</sub>, B{{Music|flat}}<sub>4</sub>, D<sub>5</sub>, and A<sub>4</sub>.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.music.umich.edu/ami/gershwin/?p=715 |title=1929 Gershwin Taxi Horn Photo Clarifies Mystery|publisher=[[University of Michigan School of Music, Theatre & Dance]]|date=March 5, 2016|accessdate=April 6, 2016 }}</ref> It is likely that in labeling the taxi horns as A, B, C and D with circles, he may have been referring to the use of the four different horns and not the notes that they played.\n\nA major revision of the work by composer and arranger F.

The first recording was made for the [[Victor Talking Machine Company]] in 1929 with [[Nathaniel Shilkret]] conducting the Victor Symphony Orchestra, drawn from members of the [[Philadelphia Orchestra]]. Gershwin was on hand to \"supervise\" the recording; however, Shilkret was reported to be in charge and eventually asked the composer to leave the recording studio. Then, a little later, Shilkret discovered there was no one to play the brief [[celesta]] solo during the slow section, so he hastily asked Gershwin if he might play the solo; Gershwin said he could and so he briefly participated in the actual recording.

He described the piece as a \"rhapsodic ballet\" because it was written freely and is more modern than his previous works. Gershwin explained in ''[[Musical America]]'', \"My purpose here is to portray the impressions of an American visitor in Paris as he strolls about the city, listens to the various street noises, and absorbs the French atmosphere.\"<ref name=\"Pollack2007\">{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RySwdc151ZoC&pg=PA431|title=George Gershwin: His Life and Work|author=Howard Pollack|authorlink=Howard Pollack|date=January 15, 2007|publisher=University of California Press|isbn=978-0-520-93314-9|location=|pages=119, 431\u2013440}}</ref>\n\nThe piece is structured into five sections, which culminate in a loose [[Ternary form|ABA format]].

The B section's \"Andante ma con ritmo deciso\" introduces the American [[Blues]] and spasms of homesickness. The \"Allegro\" that follows continues to express homesickness in a faster [[twelve-bar blues]]. In the B section, Gershwin uses common time, syncopated rhythms, and bluesy melodies with the sounds of trumpet, saxophone, and snare drum. \"Moderato con grazia\" is the last A section that returns to the themes set in A. After recapitulating the \"walking\" themes, Gershwin overlays the slow blues theme from section B in the final \"Grandioso\".\n\n==Response==\nGershwin did not particularly like Walter Damrosch's interpretation at the world premiere of ''An American in Paris''. He stated that Damrosch's sluggish, dragging tempo caused him to walk out of the hall during a matinee performance of this work. The audience, according to Edward Cushing, responded with \"a demonstration of enthusiasm impressively genuine in contrast to the conventional applause which new music, good and bad, ordinarily arouses.\" Critics believed that ''An American in Paris'' was better crafted than his lukewarm [[Concerto in F (Gershwin)|Concerto in F]]. Some did not think it belonged in a program with classical composers [[C\u00e9sar Franck]], [[Richard Wagner]], or [[Guillaume Lekeu]] on its premiere. Gershwin responded to the critics, \"It's not a Beethoven Symphony, you know... It's a humorous piece, nothing solemn about it. It's not intended to draw tears. If it pleases symphony audiences as a light, jolly piece, a series of impressions musically expressed, it succeeds.\"<ref name=\"Pollack2007\" />\n\n==Instrumentation==\n''An American in Paris'' was originally scored for 3 [[flute]]s (3rd doubling on [[piccolo]]), 2 [[oboe]]s, [[English horn]], 2 [[clarinet]]s in [[soprano clarinet|B-flat]], [[bass clarinet]] in B-flat, 2 [[bassoon]]s, [[contrabassoon]], 4 [[French horn|horns]] in F, 3 [[trumpet]]s in B-flat, 3 [[trombone]]s, [[tuba]], [[timpani]], [[snare drum]], [[bass drum]], [[Triangle (musical instrument)|triangle]], [[Woodblock (instrument)|wood block]], [[Ratchet (instrument)|ratchet]], [[cymbal]]s, low and high [[Tom-tom drum|tom-toms]], [[xylophone]], [[glockenspiel]], [[celesta]], 4 [[vehicle horn|taxi horns]] labeled as A, B, C and D with circles around them, [[alto saxophone]], [[tenor saxophone]], [[baritone saxophone]], (all saxophones doubling soprano saxophones) and [[String section|strings]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://archives.nyphil.org/index.php/artifact/47d1f79a-8ea6-4aba-964f-989cb5dc2cd7/fullview#page/4/mode/2up|title=George Gershwin: An American in Paris (original score)|website=New York Philharmonic Archives|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170904200637/http://archives.nyphil.org/index.php/artifact/47d1f79a-8ea6-4aba-964f-989cb5dc2cd7/fullview#page/4/mode/2up|archive-date=September 4, 2017|url-status=dead|access-date=September 4, 2017|df=mdy-all}}</ref> Although most modern audiences have heard the taxi horns using the notes A, B, C and D, it has recently come to light<ref name=\"nytimes1\">{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/03/02/theater/have-we-been-playing-gershwin-wrong-for-70-years.html|title=Have We Been Playing Gershwin Wrong for 70 Years?|author=Michael Cooper|date=March 1, 2016|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|accessdate=April 6, 2016 }}</ref> that Gershwin's intention was to have used the notes A{{Music|flat}}<sub>[[Scientific pitch notation|4]]</sub>, B{{Music|flat}}<sub>4</sub>, D<sub>5</sub>, and A<sub>4</sub>.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.music.umich.edu/ami/gershwin/?p=715 |title=1929 Gershwin Taxi Horn Photo Clarifies Mystery|publisher=[[University of Michigan School of Music, Theatre & Dance]]|date=March 5, 2016|accessdate=April 6, 2016 }}</ref> It is likely that in labeling the taxi horns as A, B, C and D with circles, he may have been referring to the use of the four different horns and not the notes that they played.\n\nA major revision of the work by composer and arranger F.

The first recording was made for the [[Victor Talking Machine Company]] in 1929 with [[Nathaniel Shilkret]] conducting the Victor Symphony Orchestra, drawn from members of the [[Philadelphia Orchestra]]. Gershwin was on hand to \"supervise\" the recording; however, Shilkret was reported to be in charge and eventually asked the composer to leave the recording studio. Then, a little later, Shilkret discovered there was no one to play the brief [[celesta]] solo during the slow section, so he hastily asked Gershwin if he might play the solo; Gershwin said he could and so he briefly participated in the actual recording. This recording is believed to use the taxi horns in the way that Gershwin had intended using the notes A-flat, B-flat, a higher D and a lower A.<ref name=\"nytimes1\" /> The radio broadcast of the September 8, 1937 Hollywood Bowl George Gershwin Memorial Concert, in which ''An American in Paris,'' also conducted by Shilkret, was second on the program, was recorded and was released in 1998 in a two-CD set. [[Arthur Fiedler]] and the [[Boston Pops Orchestra]] recorded the work for RCA Victor, including one of the first stereo recordings of the music.

Alfred Nobel's interest in technology was inherited from his father, an alumnus of [[Royal Institute of Technology]] in [[Stockholm]].<ref>http://www.svantelindqvist.com/anobel_inventor.pdf</ref>\n\nFollowing various business failures, Nobel's father moved to [[Saint Petersburg]] in 1837 and grew successful there as a manufacturer of machine tools and explosives. He invented the veneer lathe (which allowed the production of modern plywood<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://thetimberpanel.blogspot.com/2013/09/nobel-plywood.html|title=Nobel Plywood|language=en|access-date=2018-04-03}}</ref>) and started work on the [[naval mine|torpedo]].<ref name=MWMIH>{{cite web|title=The Man Who Made It Happen \u2014 Alfred Nobel|url=http://www.3833.com/wbn_nobel_alfred_bernhard|publisher=3833|accessdate=3 May 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140530180945/http://www.3833.com/wbn_nobel_alfred_bernhard|archive-date=30 May 2014|url-status=dead}}</ref> In 1842, the family joined him in the city. Now prosperous, his parents were able to send Nobel to private tutors and the boy excelled in his studies, particularly in chemistry and languages, achieving fluency in English, [[French language|French]], [[German language|German]] and [[Russian language|Russian]].{{r|Brit1}} For 18 months, from 1841 to 1842, Nobel went to the only school he ever attended as a child,  in Stockholm.<ref name=\"Gale\"/>\n\nAs a young man, Nobel studied with chemist [[Nikolai Nikolaevich Zinin|Nikolai Zinin]]; then, in 1850, went to [[Paris]] to further the work. There he met [[Ascanio Sobrero]], who had invented [[nitroglycerin]] three years before. Sobrero strongly opposed the use of nitroglycerin, as it was unpredictable, exploding when subjected to heat or pressure. But Nobel became interested in finding a way to control and use nitroglycerin as a commercially usable explosive, as it had much more power than [[gunpowder]]. At age 18, he went to the United States for one year to study,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://sok.riksarkivet.se/Sbl/Presentation.aspx?id=8143|title=Alfred B Nobel - Svenskt Biografiskt Lexikon|website=sok.riksarkivet.se}}</ref> working for a short period under Swedish-American inventor [[John Ericsson]], who designed the [[American Civil War]] ironclad ''[[USS Monitor]]''. Nobel filed his first patent, an English patent for a [[gas meter]], in 1857, while his first Swedish patent, which he received in 1863, was on 'ways to prepare gunpowder'.<ref name=\"Gale\"/><ref>Carlisle, Rodney (2004).

Nobel and his parents returned to Sweden from Russia and Nobel devoted himself to the study of [[explosives]], and especially to the safe manufacture and use of [[nitroglycerin]]. Nobel invented a [[detonator]] in 1863, and in 1865 designed the [[blasting cap]].{{r|Brit1}}\n\nOn 3 September 1864, a shed used for preparation of nitroglycerin exploded at the factory in [[Heleneborg]], Stockholm, Sweden, killing five people, including Nobel's younger brother [[Emil Oskar Nobel|Emil]].<ref name=\"Gale\"/> Dogged and unfazed by more minor accidents, Nobel went on to build further factories, focusing on improving the stability of the explosives he was developing.<ref name=\"Gale\"/> Nobel invented [[dynamite]] in 1867, a substance easier and safer to handle than the more unstable [[nitroglycerin]]. Dynamite was patented in the US and the UK and was used extensively in mining and the building of transport networks internationally.{{r|Brit1}} In 1875 Nobel invented [[gelignite]], more stable and powerful than dynamite, and in 1887 patented [[ballistite]], a predecessor of [[cordite]].{{r|Brit1}}\n\nNobel was elected a member of the [[Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences]] in 1884, the same institution that would later select [[laureates]] for two of the Nobel prizes, and he received an [[honorary doctorate]] from [[Uppsala University]] in 1893.\n\n[[File:Nobel's death mask.jpg|thumb|Alfred Nobel's [[death mask]], at Bjorkborn, Nobel's residence in [[Karlskoga]], Sweden]]\nNobel's brothers Ludvig and Robert exploited [[oilfields]] along the [[Caspian Sea]] and became hugely rich in their own right. Nobel invested in these and amassed great wealth through the development of these new oil regions. During his life Nobel was issued 355 [[patent]]s internationally and by his death his business had established more than 90 armaments factories, despite his apparently [[pacifist]] character.{{r|Brit1}}<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/history/historic_figures/nobel_alfred.shtml|title=Alfred Nobel (1833\u20131896)|publisher=BBC|accessdate=6 December 2015}}</ref>\n\nIn 1888, the death of his brother Ludvig caused several newspapers to publish [[obituaries]] of Alfred in error. One French newspaper published an obituary titled \"Le marchand de la mort est mort\" ''(\"The merchant of death is dead\")''. Nobel read the obituary and was appalled at the idea that he would be remembered in this way. His decision to posthumously donate the majority of his wealth to found the [[Nobel Prize]] has been credited at least in part to him wanting to leave behind a better legacy.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/blame-sloppy-journalism-for-the-nobel-prizes-1172688/|title=Blame Sloppy Journalism for the Nobel Prizes|first=Colin|last=Schultz|website=Smithsonian}}</ref><ref name=\"Brit1\"/>\n\n==Inventions==\n{{Main|Dynamite|Gelignite|Ballistite}}\n[[File:AlfredNobel adjusted.jpg|thumb|Portrait of Nobel by G\u00f6sta Florman (1831\u20131900)]]\nNobel found that when [[nitroglycerin]] was incorporated in an absorbent inert substance like ''kieselguhr'' ([[diatomaceous earth]]) it became safer and more convenient to handle, and this mixture he patented in 1867 as \"dynamite\".<ref name=\"Chisholm 1911\">{{EB1911 |inline=1 |wstitle=Nobel, Alfred Bernhard |volume=19 }}</ref> Nobel demonstrated his explosive for the first time that year, at a quarry in [[Redhill, Surrey|Redhill]], [[Surrey]], England. In order to help reestablish his name and improve the image of his business from the earlier controversies associated with the dangerous explosives, Nobel had also considered naming the highly powerful substance \"Nobel's Safety Powder\", but settled with Dynamite instead, referring to the [[Greek language|Greek]] word for \"power\" ({{lang|grc|\u03b4\u03cd\u03bd\u03b1\u03bc\u03b9\u03c2}}).\n\nNobel later combined nitroglycerin with various nitrocellulose compounds, similar to [[collodion]], but settled on a more efficient recipe combining another nitrate explosive, and obtained a transparent, jelly-like substance, which was a more powerful explosive than dynamite. '[[Gelignite]]', or blasting gelatine, as it was named, was patented in 1876; and was followed by a host of similar combinations, modified by the addition of potassium nitrate and various other substances.<ref name=\"Chisholm 1911\"/> Gelignite was more stable, transportable and conveniently formed to fit into bored holes, like those used in drilling and mining, than the previously used compounds and was adopted as the standard technology for mining in the ''Age of Engineering'' bringing Nobel a great amount of financial success, though at a significant cost to his health. An offshoot of this research resulted in Nobel's invention of [[ballistite]], the precursor of many modern smokeless powder explosives and still used as a rocket propellant.\n\n==Nobel Prizes==\n{{Main|Nobel Prize}}\n[[File:Nobel Prize.png|thumb|Front side of one of the Nobel Prize medals]] \nIn 1888, Alfred's brother, Ludvig, died while visiting [[Cannes]], and a [[France|French]] newspaper mistakenly published Alfred's [[List of premature obituaries|obituary]].{{r|Brit1}} It condemned him for his invention of military explosives (not, as is commonly quoted, dynamite, [[Dynamite#Non-dynamite_explosives|which was mainly used for civilian applications]]) and is said to have brought about his decision to leave a better legacy after his death.{{r|Brit1}}{{r|HistC}} The obituary stated, ''{{lang|fr|Le marchand de la mort est mort}}'' (\"The merchant of death is dead\"){{r|Brit1}} and went on to say, \"Dr. Alfred Nobel, who became rich by finding ways to kill more people faster than ever before, died yesterday.\"{{r|Nobel}} Alfred (who never had a wife or children) was disappointed with what he read and concerned with how he would be remembered.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ozy.com/flashback/the-newspaper-error-that-sparked-the-nobel-prize/40007|title=The Newspaper Error That Sparked the Nobel Prize|first=Sean|last=Braswell|website=OZY}}</ref>\n\nOn 27 November 1895, at the [[Sweden|Swedish]]-[[Norway|Norwegian]] Club in Paris, Nobel signed his last will and testament and set aside the bulk of his estate to establish the [[Nobel Prize]]s, to be awarded annually without distinction of nationality.<ref name=\"Chisholm 1911\"/><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.nobelprize.org/alfred-nobel/alfred-nobels-will-2/|title=Alfred Nobel\u2019s will|website=NobelPrize.org}}</ref> After taxes and bequests to individuals, Nobel's will allocated 94% of his total assets, 31,225,000 [[Swedish kronor]], to establish the five Nobel Prizes.

For many years, the Swedish Academy interpreted \"ideal\" as \"idealistic\" (''{{lang|sv|idealistisk}}'') and used it as a reason not to give the prize to important but less romantic authors, such as [[Henrik Ibsen]] and [[Leo Tolstoy]]. This interpretation has since been revised, and the prize has been awarded to, for example, [[Dario Fo]] and [[Jos\u00e9 Saramago]], who do not belong to the camp of literary idealism.{{Citation needed|date = November 2016}}\n\nThere was room for interpretation by the bodies he had named for deciding on the physical sciences and chemistry prizes, given that he had not consulted them before making the will. In his one-page testament, he stipulated that the money go to discoveries or inventions in the physical sciences and to discoveries or improvements in chemistry. He had opened the door to technological awards, but had not left instructions on how to deal with the distinction between science and technology. Since the deciding bodies he had chosen were more concerned with the former, the prizes went to scientists more often than engineers, technicians or other inventors.{{citation needed|date = November 2016}}\n\nSweden's central bank [[Sveriges Riksbank]] celebrated its 300th anniversary in 1968 by donating a large sum of money to the Nobel Foundation to be used to set up a sixth prize in the field of economics in honour of Alfred Nobel.  In 2001, Alfred Nobel's great-great-nephew, Peter Nobel (b. 1931), asked the Bank of Sweden to differentiate its award to economists given \"in Alfred Nobel's memory\" from the five other awards. This request added to the controversy over whether the [[Bank of Sweden Prize in Economic Sciences in Memory of Alfred Nobel]] is actually a legitimate \"Nobel Prize\".<ref>{{cite web|author=(Ntb-Afp) |url=http://www.aftenposten.no/fakta/nobel/article235455.ece |title=Alfred Nobels familie tar avstand fra \u00f8konomiprisen |publisher=Aftenposten.no |date= |accessdate=26 January 2014}}</ref>\n\n== Death ==\nNobel was accused of high treason against France for selling [[Ballistite]] to Italy, so he moved from Paris to [[Sanremo]], Italy in 1891.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nobelprize.org/alfred_nobel/biographical/articles/malakoff/|title=Alfred Nobel's House in Paris|last1=Nobel|first1=Alfred|website=Nobel Media AB|publisher=Nobel Media AB}}</ref><ref name=\"Death\" /> On 10 December 1896, he suffered a stroke and died.<ref name=\"Death\" /> He had left most of his wealth in trust, unbeknown to his family, in order to fund the [[Nobel Prize]] awards.{{r|Brit1}} He is buried in [[Norra begravningsplatsen]] in Stockholm.\n\n==Personal life==\nNobel was [[Lutheran]] and regularly attended the [[Church of Sweden Abroad]] during his Paris years, led by pastor [[Nathan S\u00f6derblom]] who received the [[Nobel Peace Prize]] in 1930.<ref name=\"Nobel of Peace Laureate Nathan S\u00f6derblom\">{{cite web|url=https://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/peace/laureates/1930/soderblom-bio.html|title=Nobel of Peace Laureates|date=March 2013|accessdate=8 December 2013|quote=\u2013 For seven years, from 1894 to 1901, S\u00f6derblom preached in Paris, where his congregation included Alfred Nobel}}</ref><ref name=\"biphost\">{{cite web|url=http://biphost.spray.se/john.rosen/an4a.htm|title=Alfred Nobel, hans far och hans br\u00f6der|date=March 2013|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131214063730/http://biphost.spray.se/john.rosen/an4a.htm|archivedate=14 December 2013|url-status=dead|accessdate=9 December 2013|quote=(swe: Genom dop och konfirmation var Alfred Nobel lutheran -en: Alfred Nobel was through baptism and confirmation a Lutheran)}}</ref> He became an [[agnostic]] in youth and was an [[atheist]] later in life, though still donated generously to the Church.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nobelprize.org/alfred-nobel/alfred-nobel-st-petersburg-1842-1863/|title=Alfred Nobel \u2013 St. Petersburg, 1842\u20131863|website=NobelPrize.org}}</ref><ref>Michael Evlanoff; Marjorie Fluor (1969).

Alfred Nobel's interest in technology was inherited from his father, an alumnus of [[Royal Institute of Technology]] in [[Stockholm]].<ref>http://www.svantelindqvist.com/anobel_inventor.pdf</ref>\n\nFollowing various business failures, Nobel's father moved to [[Saint Petersburg]] in 1837 and grew successful there as a manufacturer of machine tools and explosives. He invented the veneer lathe (which allowed the production of modern plywood<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://thetimberpanel.blogspot.com/2013/09/nobel-plywood.html|title=Nobel Plywood|language=en|access-date=2018-04-03}}</ref>) and started work on the [[naval mine|torpedo]].<ref name=MWMIH>{{cite web|title=The Man Who Made It Happen \u2014 Alfred Nobel|url=http://www.3833.com/wbn_nobel_alfred_bernhard|publisher=3833|accessdate=3 May 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140530180945/http://www.3833.com/wbn_nobel_alfred_bernhard|archive-date=30 May 2014|url-status=dead}}</ref> In 1842, the family joined him in the city. Now prosperous, his parents were able to send Nobel to private tutors and the boy excelled in his studies, particularly in chemistry and languages, achieving fluency in English, [[French language|French]], [[German language|German]] and [[Russian language|Russian]].{{r|Brit1}} For 18 months, from 1841 to 1842, Nobel went to the only school he ever attended as a child,  in Stockholm.<ref name=\"Gale\"/>\n\nAs a young man, Nobel studied with chemist [[Nikolai Nikolaevich Zinin|Nikolai Zinin]]; then, in 1850, went to [[Paris]] to further the work. There he met [[Ascanio Sobrero]], who had invented [[nitroglycerin]] three years before. Sobrero strongly opposed the use of nitroglycerin, as it was unpredictable, exploding when subjected to heat or pressure. But Nobel became interested in finding a way to control and use nitroglycerin as a commercially usable explosive, as it had much more power than [[gunpowder]]. At age 18, he went to the United States for one year to study,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://sok.riksarkivet.se/Sbl/Presentation.aspx?id=8143|title=Alfred B Nobel - Svenskt Biografiskt Lexikon|website=sok.riksarkivet.se}}</ref> working for a short period under Swedish-American inventor [[John Ericsson]], who designed the [[American Civil War]] ironclad ''[[USS Monitor]]''.

Nobel and his parents returned to Sweden from Russia and Nobel devoted himself to the study of [[explosives]], and especially to the safe manufacture and use of [[nitroglycerin]]. Nobel invented a [[detonator]] in 1863, and in 1865 designed the [[blasting cap]].{{r|Brit1}}\n\nOn 3 September 1864, a shed used for preparation of nitroglycerin exploded at the factory in [[Heleneborg]], Stockholm, Sweden, killing five people, including Nobel's younger brother [[Emil Oskar Nobel|Emil]].<ref name=\"Gale\"/> Dogged and unfazed by more minor accidents, Nobel went on to build further factories, focusing on improving the stability of the explosives he was developing.<ref name=\"Gale\"/> Nobel invented [[dynamite]] in 1867, a substance easier and safer to handle than the more unstable [[nitroglycerin]]. Dynamite was patented in the US and the UK and was used extensively in mining and the building of transport networks internationally.{{r|Brit1}} In 1875 Nobel invented [[gelignite]], more stable and powerful than dynamite, and in 1887 patented [[ballistite]], a predecessor of [[cordite]].{{r|Brit1}}\n\nNobel was elected a member of the [[Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences]] in 1884, the same institution that would later select [[laureates]] for two of the Nobel prizes, and he received an [[honorary doctorate]] from [[Uppsala University]] in 1893.\n\n[[File:Nobel's death mask.jpg|thumb|Alfred Nobel's [[death mask]], at Bjorkborn, Nobel's residence in [[Karlskoga]], Sweden]]\nNobel's brothers Ludvig and Robert exploited [[oilfields]] along the [[Caspian Sea]] and became hugely rich in their own right. Nobel invested in these and amassed great wealth through the development of these new oil regions. During his life Nobel was issued 355 [[patent]]s internationally and by his death his business had established more than 90 armaments factories, despite his apparently [[pacifist]] character.{{r|Brit1}}<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/history/historic_figures/nobel_alfred.shtml|title=Alfred Nobel (1833\u20131896)|publisher=BBC|accessdate=6 December 2015}}</ref>\n\nIn 1888, the death of his brother Ludvig caused several newspapers to publish [[obituaries]] of Alfred in error. One French newspaper published an obituary titled \"Le marchand de la mort est mort\" ''(\"The merchant of death is dead\")''. Nobel read the obituary and was appalled at the idea that he would be remembered in this way. His decision to posthumously donate the majority of his wealth to found the [[Nobel Prize]] has been credited at least in part to him wanting to leave behind a better legacy.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/blame-sloppy-journalism-for-the-nobel-prizes-1172688/|title=Blame Sloppy Journalism for the Nobel Prizes|first=Colin|last=Schultz|website=Smithsonian}}</ref><ref name=\"Brit1\"/>\n\n==Inventions==\n{{Main|Dynamite|Gelignite|Ballistite}}\n[[File:AlfredNobel adjusted.jpg|thumb|Portrait of Nobel by G\u00f6sta Florman (1831\u20131900)]]\nNobel found that when [[nitroglycerin]] was incorporated in an absorbent inert substance like ''kieselguhr'' ([[diatomaceous earth]]) it became safer and more convenient to handle, and this mixture he patented in 1867 as \"dynamite\".<ref name=\"Chisholm 1911\">{{EB1911 |inline=1 |wstitle=Nobel, Alfred Bernhard |volume=19 }}</ref> Nobel demonstrated his explosive for the first time that year, at a quarry in [[Redhill, Surrey|Redhill]], [[Surrey]], England. In order to help reestablish his name and improve the image of his business from the earlier controversies associated with the dangerous explosives, Nobel had also considered naming the highly powerful substance \"Nobel's Safety Powder\", but settled with Dynamite instead, referring to the [[Greek language|Greek]] word for \"power\" ({{lang|grc|\u03b4\u03cd\u03bd\u03b1\u03bc\u03b9\u03c2}}).\n\nNobel later combined nitroglycerin with various nitrocellulose compounds, similar to [[collodion]], but settled on a more efficient recipe combining another nitrate explosive, and obtained a transparent, jelly-like substance, which was a more powerful explosive than dynamite. '[[Gelignite]]', or blasting gelatine, as it was named, was patented in 1876; and was followed by a host of similar combinations, modified by the addition of potassium nitrate and various other substances.<ref name=\"Chisholm 1911\"/> Gelignite was more stable, transportable and conveniently formed to fit into bored holes, like those used in drilling and mining, than the previously used compounds and was adopted as the standard technology for mining in the ''Age of Engineering'' bringing Nobel a great amount of financial success, though at a significant cost to his health. An offshoot of this research resulted in Nobel's invention of [[ballistite]], the precursor of many modern smokeless powder explosives and still used as a rocket propellant.\n\n==Nobel Prizes==\n{{Main|Nobel Prize}}\n[[File:Nobel Prize.png|thumb|Front side of one of the Nobel Prize medals]] \nIn 1888, Alfred's brother, Ludvig, died while visiting [[Cannes]], and a [[France|French]] newspaper mistakenly published Alfred's [[List of premature obituaries|obituary]].{{r|Brit1}} It condemned him for his invention of military explosives (not, as is commonly quoted, dynamite, [[Dynamite#Non-dynamite_explosives|which was mainly used for civilian applications]]) and is said to have brought about his decision to leave a better legacy after his death.{{r|Brit1}}{{r|HistC}} The obituary stated, ''{{lang|fr|Le marchand de la mort est mort}}'' (\"The merchant of death is dead\"){{r|Brit1}} and went on to say, \"Dr. Alfred Nobel, who became rich by finding ways to kill more people faster than ever before, died yesterday.\"{{r|Nobel}} Alfred (who never had a wife or children) was disappointed with what he read and concerned with how he would be remembered.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ozy.com/flashback/the-newspaper-error-that-sparked-the-nobel-prize/40007|title=The Newspaper Error That Sparked the Nobel Prize|first=Sean|last=Braswell|website=OZY}}</ref>\n\nOn 27 November 1895, at the [[Sweden|Swedish]]-[[Norway|Norwegian]] Club in Paris, Nobel signed his last will and testament and set aside the bulk of his estate to establish the [[Nobel Prize]]s, to be awarded annually without distinction of nationality.<ref name=\"Chisholm 1911\"/><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.nobelprize.org/alfred-nobel/alfred-nobels-will-2/|title=Alfred Nobel\u2019s will|website=NobelPrize.org}}</ref> After taxes and bequests to individuals, Nobel's will allocated 94% of his total assets, 31,225,000 [[Swedish kronor]], to establish the five Nobel Prizes.

For many years, the Swedish Academy interpreted \"ideal\" as \"idealistic\" (''{{lang|sv|idealistisk}}'') and used it as a reason not to give the prize to important but less romantic authors, such as [[Henrik Ibsen]] and [[Leo Tolstoy]]. This interpretation has since been revised, and the prize has been awarded to, for example, [[Dario Fo]] and [[Jos\u00e9 Saramago]], who do not belong to the camp of literary idealism.{{Citation needed|date = November 2016}}\n\nThere was room for interpretation by the bodies he had named for deciding on the physical sciences and chemistry prizes, given that he had not consulted them before making the will. In his one-page testament, he stipulated that the money go to discoveries or inventions in the physical sciences and to discoveries or improvements in chemistry. He had opened the door to technological awards, but had not left instructions on how to deal with the distinction between science and technology. Since the deciding bodies he had chosen were more concerned with the former, the prizes went to scientists more often than engineers, technicians or other inventors.{{citation needed|date = November 2016}}\n\nSweden's central bank [[Sveriges Riksbank]] celebrated its 300th anniversary in 1968 by donating a large sum of money to the Nobel Foundation to be used to set up a sixth prize in the field of economics in honour of Alfred Nobel.  In 2001, Alfred Nobel's great-great-nephew, Peter Nobel (b. 1931), asked the Bank of Sweden to differentiate its award to economists given \"in Alfred Nobel's memory\" from the five other awards. This request added to the controversy over whether the [[Bank of Sweden Prize in Economic Sciences in Memory of Alfred Nobel]] is actually a legitimate \"Nobel Prize\".<ref>{{cite web|author=(Ntb-Afp) |url=http://www.aftenposten.no/fakta/nobel/article235455.ece |title=Alfred Nobels familie tar avstand fra \u00f8konomiprisen |publisher=Aftenposten.no |date= |accessdate=26 January 2014}}</ref>\n\n== Death ==\nNobel was accused of high treason against France for selling [[Ballistite]] to Italy, so he moved from Paris to [[Sanremo]], Italy in 1891.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nobelprize.org/alfred_nobel/biographical/articles/malakoff/|title=Alfred Nobel's House in Paris|last1=Nobel|first1=Alfred|website=Nobel Media AB|publisher=Nobel Media AB}}</ref><ref name=\"Death\" /> On 10 December 1896, he suffered a stroke and died.<ref name=\"Death\" /> He had left most of his wealth in trust, unbeknown to his family, in order to fund the [[Nobel Prize]] awards.{{r|Brit1}} He is buried in [[Norra begravningsplatsen]] in Stockholm.\n\n==Personal life==\nNobel was [[Lutheran]] and regularly attended the [[Church of Sweden Abroad]] during his Paris years, led by pastor [[Nathan S\u00f6derblom]] who received the [[Nobel Peace Prize]] in 1930.<ref name=\"Nobel of Peace Laureate Nathan S\u00f6derblom\">{{cite web|url=https://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/peace/laureates/1930/soderblom-bio.html|title=Nobel of Peace Laureates|date=March 2013|accessdate=8 December 2013|quote=\u2013 For seven years, from 1894 to 1901, S\u00f6derblom preached in Paris, where his congregation included Alfred Nobel}}</ref><ref name=\"biphost\">{{cite web|url=http://biphost.spray.se/john.rosen/an4a.htm|title=Alfred Nobel, hans far och hans br\u00f6der|date=March 2013|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131214063730/http://biphost.spray.se/john.rosen/an4a.htm|archivedate=14 December 2013|url-status=dead|accessdate=9 December 2013|quote=(swe: Genom dop och konfirmation var Alfred Nobel lutheran -en: Alfred Nobel was through baptism and confirmation a Lutheran)}}</ref> He became an [[agnostic]] in youth and was an [[atheist]] later in life, though still donated generously to the Church.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nobelprize.org/alfred-nobel/alfred-nobel-st-petersburg-1842-1863/|title=Alfred Nobel \u2013 St. Petersburg, 1842\u20131863|website=NobelPrize.org}}</ref><ref>Michael Evlanoff; Marjorie Fluor (1969).

Greenleaf and George R. Wilson filed land claims in the area formerly inhabited by the Sammamish near present-day Bothell, and built homes. Eight families followed over the next six years. In 1876, Canadian George Brackett bought land and began commercial logging out of a camp located on the north bank of the Sammamish River in what is now the heart of downtown Bothell. A store, school, and sawmill followed over the next several years.\n\nIn 1885, Brackett sold {{convert|80|acre}} to David Bothell, a settler from [[Pennsylvania]].

As more people moved into the area, the [[United States Army Corps of Engineers|Army Corps of Engineers]] decided to dredge and straighten the river in the years shortly after Bothell's incorporation. Most boat traffic came to an abrupt end only a few years later when Lake Washington was lowered in 1917. Water transport also shifted to trucks after a brick road was built from Seattle. The logging economy declined quickly around the same time, and the local economy shifted to farming.<ref name=\"Sammamish\"/>\n\nAfter World War II, better highways and a post-war boom brought [[suburban]] development to Bothell.

Words that are synonyms are said to be '''synonymous''', and the state of being a synonym is called '''synonymy'''.  For example, the words ''begin'', ''start'', ''commence'', and ''initiate'' are all synonyms of one another. Words are typically synonymous in one particular [[word sense|sense]]: for example, ''long'' and ''extended'' in the [[context (language use)|context]] ''long time'' or ''extended time'' are synonymous, but ''long'' cannot be used in the phrase ''extended family''. Synonyms with exactly the same meaning share a [[seme (semantics)|seme]] or denotational [[sememe]], whereas those with inexactly similar meanings share a broader denotational or [[connotation]]al sememe and thus overlap within a [[semantic field]]. The former are sometimes called [[cognitive synonymy|cognitive synonyms]] and the latter, near-synonyms,<ref name=\"Stanojevi%C4%87_2009\">{{Citation |last=Stanojevi\u0107 |first=Maja |year=2009 |title= Cognitive synonymy: a general overview |journal=Facta Universitatis, Linguistics and Literature series |volume=7 |issue=2 |pages=193\u2013200 | url=/lal/lal200902/lal200902-05.pdf |doi= |postscript=.}}</ref> plesionyms<ref>DiMarco, Chrysanne, and Graeme Hirst. \"Usage notes as the basis for a representation of near-synonymy for lexical choice.\" Proceedings of 9th annual conference of the University of Waterloo Centre for the New Oxford English Dictionary and Text Research. 1993.</ref> or poecilonyms.<ref>Grambs, David. The Endangered English Dictionary: Bodacious Words Your Dictionary Forgot. WW Norton & Company, 1997.</ref>\n\n==Lexicography==\nSome [[lexicographer]]s claim that no synonyms have exactly the same meaning (in all contexts or social levels of language) because [[etymology]], [[orthography]], phonic qualities, [[connotation]]s, ambiguous meanings, [[usage (language)|usage]], and so on make them unique. Different words that are similar in meaning usually differ for a reason: ''feline'' is more formal than ''cat''; ''long'' and ''extended'' are only synonyms in one usage and not in others (for example, a ''long arm'' is not the same as an ''extended arm'').

Words that are synonyms are said to be '''synonymous''', and the state of being a synonym is called '''synonymy'''.  For example, the words ''begin'', ''start'', ''commence'', and ''initiate'' are all synonyms of one another. Words are typically synonymous in one particular [[word sense|sense]]: for example, ''long'' and ''extended'' in the [[context (language use)|context]] ''long time'' or ''extended time'' are synonymous, but ''long'' cannot be used in the phrase ''extended family''. Synonyms with exactly the same meaning share a [[seme (semantics)|seme]] or denotational [[sememe]], whereas those with inexactly similar meanings share a broader denotational or [[connotation]]al sememe and thus overlap within a [[semantic field]].

{"title_page": "Septimiu Albini", "text_new": "[[File:Septimiu-Albini.jpg|thumb|Septimiu Albini]]\n'''Septimiu Albini''' (June 9, 1861 \u2013 November 7, 1919) was an [[Austria-Hungary|Imperial Austrian]]-born [[Romania]]n journalist and political activist. A native of [[Transylvania]], he attended the [[University of Vienna]], where he was active in the local affiliate of ''[[Junimea]]'' society. Invited by [[Ioan Slavici]], he settled in [[Sibiu]] in 1886, where he edited ''[[Tribuna (Romania)|Tribuna]]'' newspaper and delved into political journalism for the following eight years. The period was marked by several stays in prison for press infractions. His time there came to an abrupt end in 1894, when he was sentenced to prison for having signed the [[Transylvanian Memorandum]]. Rather than undergo further incarceration, Albini fled to the [[Romanian Old Kingdom]], where he lived in relative obscurity.\n\n==Biography==\n===Origins and education===\nBorn in [[\u0218pring]], [[Alba County]], in the [[Transylvania]] region, Septimiu Albini was the first of two sons born to Vasile Albini, a former vice-tribune in the legion of [[Axente Sever]] during the [[Transylvanian Revolution of 1848|Transylvanian Revolution of 1848\u20131849]]; and to Emilia Neagoe, a niece of [[Romanian Greek-Catholic Church|Greek-Catholic]] [[Metropolitan bishop|Metropolitan]] [[Alexandru Sterca-\u0218ulu\u021biu]]. His father played an important role in Albini's intellectual development, telling stories about the events of 1848. The effort to imbue the son with patriotism began early: when the infant was forty days old, Vasile Albini symbolically dedicated him to [[Michael the Brave]].<ref name=\"r43\"/> His childhood was spent in nearby [[Cut, Alba|Cut]], where the family originated.<ref name=\"r12\">Ru\u0219e\u021b 2014, p. 12</ref> He attended secondary school at [[Inochentie Micu Clain National College|the Romanian high school]] in [[Blaj]] and [[Samuel von Brukenthal National College|the German high school]] in [[Sibiu]], and although this environment exposed him to Latinist principles, he entered into contact with ''[[Junimea|Junimist]]'' ideas by reading ''[[Convorbiri Literare]]'' and soon subscribed to the society's principles.<ref name=\"r43\"/><ref name=\"r12\"/><ref name=\"p224\">Popovici, p. 224</ref> He took part in poetry readings at the home of [[Visarion Roman]], his future father-in-law.<ref name=\"p224\"/> He received a degree from Blaj.<ref name=\"r12\"/>\n\nThen, from 1879 to 1883, he attended the literature and philosophy faculty of the [[University of Vienna]] on a scholarship from ''Junimea'', based in the [[Romanian Old Kingdom]] city of [[Ia\u0219i]]. He entered ''Rom\u00e2nia Jun\u0103'' Society,<ref name=\"r43\"/> while there, he advocated for a phonetic spelling of Romanian, following the lead of [[Titu Maiorescu]] and standing in opposition to the etymological approach of his former teacher [[Timotei Cipariu]].<ref name=\"buzasi\"/> In later years, he would remember the friendship he developed at Vienna with a fellow Romanian student, Ioan Paul; the two would attend society meetings together and spend much of their free time discussing literature.<ref name=\"r43\">Ru\u0219e\u021b 2013, p. 43</ref> In 1880, wishing to chart a new course, the society members founded a literary club, \"Arborele\", with fourteen or seventeen participants. These selected assumed names; Albini was ''Mugur'' or \"bud\", a name with which he also signed literary work. He took part in festive meetings honoring ''Junimea''.<ref name=\"r44\">Ru\u0219e\u021b 2013, p. 44</ref>\n\n===''Tribuna'' years===\nAfter graduating, Albini found himself unwilling to emigrate to the Old Kingdom, like some of his classmates, and instead returned to Cut. In the subsequent period, he spent a good part of his time administering the family property, but also wrote articles and sent them to ''[[Tribuna (Romania)|Tribuna]]'' newspaper in Sibiu. In 1886, [[Ioan Slavici]], the director of ''Tribuna'', invited Albini to Sibiu in order to become editor.<ref name=\"r42\"/> Not only did the elder man appreciate Albini's writing and attachment to ''Tribunist'' principles, he had also decided upon founding the newspaper that a certain number of its staff, invariably including the editor, would be Greek-Catholics.<ref name=\"p224\"/> Albini accepted on condition he be allowed to apply for a post for the 1886\u20131887 school year as teacher at the local [[Asocia\u021bia Transilvan\u0103 pentru Literatura Rom\u00e2n\u0103 \u0219i Cultura Poporului Rom\u00e2n|Astra]] girls' school. He embraced the newspaper's cultural views, but was not especially interested in politics at that point. In the summer of 1886, he was hired for the school job, working there until 1888.<ref name=\"r42\"/> Hired as principal the previous year, he resigned due to differences with the Astra leadership.<ref name=\"r12\"/> While at the school, he taught Romanian language, history and geography of Hungary; the position allowed him to promote emerging ideas and a love for rural Transylvanian values.<ref name=\"r44\"/> He was a member of the [[Romanian National Party]], rising to become its secretary,<ref name=\"r42\">Ru\u0219e\u021b 2013, p. 42</ref> and joining its leadership committee in early 1892.<ref>[http://www.elite-research.eu/Catalogue%20Hungary%201881-1918.pdf \"The structure of the Central Electoral Committees of the Romanian National Party from Transylvania and Hungary (1881\u20131918)\"], The Political Elite from Transylvania (1867\u20131918) project site</ref> In May 1891, he took part in the first congress of the [[Cultural League for the Unity of All Romanians]].<ref name=\"r13\">Ru\u0219e\u021b 2014, p. 13</ref>\n\nFrom 1888 to 1894, Albini was director and editor of ''Tribuna''; the position had become vacant following Slavici's sentencing to a year's imprisonment.<ref name=\"p226\">Popovici, p. 226</ref> In this position, he was deeply involved in cultural affairs,<ref name=\"r445\"/> and contributed two rural-themed short stories to the newspaper, \"O sear\u0103 la Brustureni\" and \"Un s\u0103rac avut\". Additionally, \"Un nou filorom\u00e2n\" is a polemic directed against a book by an obscure Hungarian writer, S\u00e1ndor Lengyel, that Albini considered defamatory toward the peasants of the [[Apuseni Mountains]].<ref name=\"buzasi\"/> However, he increasingly became enmeshed in political and national matters as well. This side of his activity saw Albini charged in several press trials, leading to his incarceration in [[Cluj]] for a month in 1889 and for six months at [[V\u00e1c]] in 1890\u20131891. In 1893, just after becoming engaged, he spent three months in the prison at [[Szeged]].<ref name=\"r445\"/> As a signer of the [[Transylvanian Memorandum]], he was put on trial. His health weakened following the winter prison stay at Szeged, he could not attend the May 1894 sentencing, and instead waited until October to learn of the two and a half years' sentence. The state of his health, combined with the fact that he was recently married and had a newborn son, and was still a young man, led Albini to flee to Romania and avoid punishment. Another contributing factor was likely the letter of [[Dimitrie Sturdza]], head of Romania's [[National Liberal Party (Romania, 1875)|National Liberal Party]], urging those sentenced not to accept the verdict and instead continue their struggle out of the Old Kingdom.<ref name=\"p222\">Popovici, p. 222</ref> His \"desertion\" was strongly condemned by fellow signatories who served their sentences, including by ''Tribuna'' colleagues,<ref name=\"p222\"/><ref name=\"r445\"/> but Albini justified his action through articles published there.<ref name=\"r445\">Ru\u0219e\u021b 2013, pp. 44\u20135</ref>\n\n===Exile and legacy===\nIn Romania, Albini initially experienced a period of material difficulties, eventually finding work as a secretary at the [[Romanian Academy]], remaining there until 1918.<ref name=\"r45\"/> He also functioned as a schoolteacher during this period.<ref name=\"buzasi\"/> His actions in Transylvania's Romanian national movement became peripheral, taking the form of occasional press articles or brochures.<ref name=\"r45\">Ru\u0219e\u021b 2013, p. 45</ref> In 1914, following the outbreak of World War I, he went to [[Czernowitz]] as a delegate of the Academy, returning with eleven crates of material for [[Sextil Pu\u0219cariu]]'s dictionary of the Romanian language.<ref name=\"r13\"/> He left behind eight partly unpublished manuscripts, of which six dealt with politics. These are generally of mediocre value to historians, although his unfinished memoir about the ''Tribuna'' period offers valuable first-hand insights about how the newspaper functioned.<ref>Ru\u0219e\u021b 2014, pp. 10\u201311</ref>\n\nAlbini married Aurelia Roman in February 1894; the marriage sponsor was [[Gheorghe Bogdan-Duic\u0103]].<ref name=\"r13\"/> The couple had three sons; the eldest was killed in the [[Battle of M\u0103r\u0103\u0219e\u0219ti]]. In 1919, following the [[union of Transylvania with Romania]], he returned to his native region for the first time since emigrating, visiting the places where he grew up. Shortly thereafter, he died of pneumonia and was buried at Cut alongside family members.<ref name=\"r45\"/> In 1998, Ilie Moise published a collection of Albini's literary and pedagogical writings. Gathering nearly all his work for ''Tribuna'', the first section includes the two short stories, seen as precursors to the prose of [[Ion Ag\u00e2rbiceanu]] and [[Pavel Dan]], as well as history, literary criticism and folklore studies. Notable in the latter category is \"Din seara de Cr\u0103ciun\", which looks in detail at the practice of Christmas caroling.

A native of [[Transylvania]], he attended the [[University of Vienna]], where he was active in the local affiliate of ''[[Junimea]]'' society. Invited by [[Ioan Slavici]], he settled in [[Sibiu]] in 1886, where he edited ''[[Tribuna (Romania)|Tribuna]]'' newspaper and delved into political journalism for the following eight years. The period was marked by several stays in prison for press infractions. His time there came to an abrupt end in 1894, when he was sentenced to prison for having signed the [[Transylvanian Memorandum]]. Rather than undergo further incarceration, Albini fled to the [[Romanian Old Kingdom]], where he lived in relative obscurity.\n\n==Biography==\n===Origins and education===\nBorn in [[\u0218pring]], [[Alba County]], in the [[Transylvania]] region, Septimiu Albini was the first of two sons born to Vasile Albini, a former vice-tribune in the legion of [[Axente Sever]] during the [[Transylvanian Revolution of 1848|Transylvanian Revolution of 1848\u20131849]]; and to Emilia Neagoe, a niece of [[Romanian Greek-Catholic Church|Greek-Catholic]] [[Metropolitan bishop|Metropolitan]] [[Alexandru Sterca-\u0218ulu\u021biu]]. His father played an important role in Albini's intellectual development, telling stories about the events of 1848. The effort to imbue the son with patriotism began early: when the infant was forty days old, Vasile Albini symbolically dedicated him to [[Michael the Brave]].<ref name=\"r43\"/> His childhood was spent in nearby [[Cut, Alba|Cut]], where the family originated.<ref name=\"r12\">Ru\u0219e\u021b 2014, p. 12</ref> He attended secondary school at [[Inochentie Micu Clain National College|the Romanian high school]] in [[Blaj]] and [[Samuel von Brukenthal National College|the German high school]] in [[Sibiu]], and although this environment exposed him to Latinist principles, he entered into contact with ''[[Junimea|Junimist]]'' ideas by reading ''[[Convorbiri Literare]]'' and soon subscribed to the society's principles.<ref name=\"r43\"/><ref name=\"r12\"/><ref name=\"p224\">Popovici, p. 224</ref> He took part in poetry readings at the home of [[Visarion Roman]], his future father-in-law.<ref name=\"p224\"/> He received a degree from Blaj.<ref name=\"r12\"/>\n\nThen, from 1879 to 1883, he attended the literature and philosophy faculty of the [[University of Vienna]] on a scholarship from ''Junimea'', based in the [[Romanian Old Kingdom]] city of [[Ia\u0219i]]. He entered ''Rom\u00e2nia Jun\u0103'' Society,<ref name=\"r43\"/> while there, he advocated for a phonetic spelling of Romanian, following the lead of [[Titu Maiorescu]] and standing in opposition to the etymological approach of his former teacher [[Timotei Cipariu]].<ref name=\"buzasi\"/> In later years, he would remember the friendship he developed at Vienna with a fellow Romanian student, Ioan Paul; the two would attend society meetings together and spend much of their free time discussing literature.<ref name=\"r43\">Ru\u0219e\u021b 2013, p. 43</ref> In 1880, wishing to chart a new course, the society members founded a literary club, \"Arborele\", with fourteen or seventeen participants. These selected assumed names; Albini was ''Mugur'' or \"bud\", a name with which he also signed literary work. He took part in festive meetings honoring ''Junimea''.<ref name=\"r44\">Ru\u0219e\u021b 2013, p. 44</ref>\n\n===''Tribuna'' years===\nAfter graduating, Albini found himself unwilling to emigrate to the Old Kingdom, like some of his classmates, and instead returned to Cut. In the subsequent period, he spent a good part of his time administering the family property, but also wrote articles and sent them to ''[[Tribuna (Romania)|Tribuna]]'' newspaper in Sibiu. In 1886, [[Ioan Slavici]], the director of ''Tribuna'', invited Albini to Sibiu in order to become editor.<ref name=\"r42\"/> Not only did the elder man appreciate Albini's writing and attachment to ''Tribunist'' principles, he had also decided upon founding the newspaper that a certain number of its staff, invariably including the editor, would be Greek-Catholics.<ref name=\"p224\"/> Albini accepted on condition he be allowed to apply for a post for the 1886\u20131887 school year as teacher at the local [[Asocia\u021bia Transilvan\u0103 pentru Literatura Rom\u00e2n\u0103 \u0219i Cultura Poporului Rom\u00e2n|Astra]] girls' school. He embraced the newspaper's cultural views, but was not especially interested in politics at that point. In the summer of 1886, he was hired for the school job, working there until 1888.<ref name=\"r42\"/> Hired as principal the previous year, he resigned due to differences with the Astra leadership.<ref name=\"r12\"/> While at the school, he taught Romanian language, history and geography of Hungary; the position allowed him to promote emerging ideas and a love for rural Transylvanian values.<ref name=\"r44\"/> He was a member of the [[Romanian National Party]], rising to become its secretary,<ref name=\"r42\">Ru\u0219e\u021b 2013, p. 42</ref> and joining its leadership committee in early 1892.<ref>[http://www.elite-research.eu/Catalogue%20Hungary%201881-1918.pdf \"The structure of the Central Electoral Committees of the Romanian National Party from Transylvania and Hungary (1881\u20131918)\"], The Political Elite from Transylvania (1867\u20131918) project site</ref> In May 1891, he took part in the first congress of the [[Cultural League for the Unity of All Romanians]].<ref name=\"r13\">Ru\u0219e\u021b 2014, p. 13</ref>\n\nFrom 1888 to 1894, Albini was director and editor of ''Tribuna''; the position had become vacant following Slavici's sentencing to a year's imprisonment.<ref name=\"p226\">Popovici, p. 226</ref> In this position, he was deeply involved in cultural affairs,<ref name=\"r445\"/> and contributed two rural-themed short stories to the newspaper, \"O sear\u0103 la Brustureni\" and \"Un s\u0103rac avut\". Additionally, \"Un nou filorom\u00e2n\" is a polemic directed against a book by an obscure Hungarian writer, S\u00e1ndor Lengyel, that Albini considered defamatory toward the peasants of the [[Apuseni Mountains]].<ref name=\"buzasi\"/> However, he increasingly became enmeshed in political and national matters as well. This side of his activity saw Albini charged in several press trials, leading to his incarceration in [[Cluj]] for a month in 1889 and for six months at [[V\u00e1c]] in 1890\u20131891. In 1893, just after becoming engaged, he spent three months in the prison at [[Szeged]].<ref name=\"r445\"/> As a signer of the [[Transylvanian Memorandum]], he was put on trial. His health weakened following the winter prison stay at Szeged, he could not attend the May 1894 sentencing, and instead waited until October to learn of the two and a half years' sentence. The state of his health, combined with the fact that he was recently married and had a newborn son, and was still a young man, led Albini to flee to Romania and avoid punishment. Another contributing factor was likely the letter of [[Dimitrie Sturdza]], head of Romania's [[National Liberal Party (Romania, 1875)|National Liberal Party]], urging those sentenced not to accept the verdict and instead continue their struggle out of the Old Kingdom.<ref name=\"p222\">Popovici, p. 222</ref> His \"desertion\" was strongly condemned by fellow signatories who served their sentences, including by ''Tribuna'' colleagues,<ref name=\"p222\"/><ref name=\"r445\"/> but Albini justified his action through articles published there.<ref name=\"r445\">Ru\u0219e\u021b 2013, pp. 44\u20135</ref>\n\n===Exile and legacy===\nIn Romania, Albini initially experienced a period of material difficulties, eventually finding work as a secretary at the [[Romanian Academy]], remaining there until 1918.<ref name=\"r45\"/> He also functioned as a schoolteacher during this period.<ref name=\"buzasi\"/> His actions in Transylvania's Romanian national movement became peripheral, taking the form of occasional press articles or brochures.<ref name=\"r45\">Ru\u0219e\u021b 2013, p. 45</ref> In 1914, following the outbreak of World War I, he went to [[Czernowitz]] as a delegate of the Academy, returning with eleven crates of material for [[Sextil Pu\u0219cariu]]'s dictionary of the Romanian language.<ref name=\"r13\"/> He left behind eight partly unpublished manuscripts, of which six dealt with politics. These are generally of mediocre value to historians, although his unfinished memoir about the ''Tribuna'' period offers valuable first-hand insights about how the newspaper functioned.<ref>Ru\u0219e\u021b 2014, pp. 10\u201311</ref>\n\nAlbini married Aurelia Roman in February 1894; the marriage sponsor was [[Gheorghe Bogdan-Duic\u0103]].<ref name=\"r13\"/> The couple had three sons; the eldest was killed in the [[Battle of M\u0103r\u0103\u0219e\u0219ti]]. In 1919, following the [[union of Transylvania with Romania]], he returned to his native region for the first time since emigrating, visiting the places where he grew up. Shortly thereafter, he died of pneumonia and was buried at Cut alongside family members.<ref name=\"r45\"/> In 1998, Ilie Moise published a collection of Albini's literary and pedagogical writings. Gathering nearly all his work for ''Tribuna'', the first section includes the two short stories, seen as precursors to the prose of [[Ion Ag\u00e2rbiceanu]] and [[Pavel Dan]], as well as history, literary criticism and folklore studies. Notable in the latter category is \"Din seara de Cr\u0103ciun\", which looks in detail at the practice of Christmas caroling.

''[[De facto]]'' independence was established in 1314 at the [[Battle of Bannockburn]].  The wars were caused by English kings attempting to establish their authority over Scotland while Scots fought to keep English rule and authority out of Scotland.<ref name=bbc>{{cite web| title =Scotland's History: The Wars of Independence| work =BBC| url =http://www.bbc.co.uk/scotland/history/articles/the_wars_of_independence/}}</ref><ref name=scot>{{cite web| title =The Scottish Wars of Independence, 1286-1328| work =Education Scotland| url =http://www.educationscotland.gov.uk/higherscottishhistory/warsofindependence/index.asp| url-status =dead| archiveurl =https://web.archive.org/web/20131004063959/http://www.educationscotland.gov.uk/higherscottishhistory/warsofindependence/index.asp| archivedate =4 October 2013| df =dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nThe term \"War of Independence\" did not exist at the time. The war was given that name retroactively many centuries later, after the [[American War of Independence]] made the term popular.\n\n== Background ==\nWhen King [[Alexander III of Scotland|Alexander III]]<ref>(Medieval Gaelic: Alaxandair mac Alaxandair; Modern Gaelic: Alasdair mac Alasdair)</ref> ruled Scotland, his reign had seen a period of peace and economic stability. On 19 March 1286, however, Alexander died after falling from his horse. The heir to the throne was Alexander's granddaughter, [[Margaret, Maid of Norway]]. As she was still a child and in Norway, the Scottish lords set up a government of guardians.  Margaret fell ill on the voyage to Scotland and died in Orkney on 26 September 1290. The lack of a clear heir led to a period known as [[Competitors for the Crown of Scotland]] or the \"Great Cause\", with several families laying claim to the throne.\n\nWith Scotland threatening to descend into civil war, King [[Edward I of England]] was invited in by the Scottish nobility to arbitrate. Before the process could begin, he insisted that all of the contenders recognise him as [[Lord Paramount of Scotland]]. In early November 1292, at a great feudal court held in the castle at [[Berwick-upon-Tweed]], judgement was given in favour of [[John Balliol]] having the strongest claim in law.\n\nEdward proceeded to reverse the rulings of the Scottish Lords and even summoned King John Balliol to stand before the English court as a common plaintiff. John was a weak king, known as \"Toom Tabard\" or \"Empty Coat\". John renounced his [[Homage (feudal)|homage]] in March 1296. \n\nThat same month Edward [[English invasion of Scotland (1296)|invaded Scotland]] and stormed Berwick-upon-Tweed, sacking the then-Scottish border town.  In April, the Scots were defeated at the [[Battle of Dunbar (1296)|Battle of Dunbar]] in [[East Lothian]]. By July, Edward had forced John to abdicate. Edward instructed his officers to receive formal homage from some 1,800 Scottish nobles (many of the rest being prisoners of war at that time).\n\n== Andrew Moray and William Wallace ==\n\n=== Rise of Moray and Wallace ===\n[[File:Wallace statue, Lanark.JPG|thumb|120px|Wallace statue, Lanark]]\n\nThroughout Scotland, there was widespread discontent and disorder after the English Crown extended its dominion over Scotland. Acts of defiance were targeted at local English officials. In 1297, the country erupted in open revolt. [[Andrew Moray|Andrew de Moray]] and [[William Wallace]] emerged as the first significant Scottish patriots.<ref name=bbc/><ref name=scot/>\n\nAndrew de Moray was the son of a northern landowner, Sir [[Andrew Moray (justiciar)|Andrew de Moray of Petty]]. Andrew and his father were both captured in the rout after the [[Battle of Dunbar (1296)|Battle of Dunbar]] in April 1296. Andrew the younger was initially held captive in [[Chester Castle]] on the Anglo-Welsh border, from which he escaped during the winter of 1296\u201397. He returned to his father's castle at [[Avoch]] on the northern shore of the [[Moray Firth]], where he raised his banner in the name of Scotland's king, [[John Balliol]]. Moray quickly gathered a band of like-minded patriots, and employing hit-and-run guerrilla tactics, began to attack and devastate every English-garrisoned castle from Banff to [[Inverness]]. The entire province of [[Moray]] was soon in revolt against King [[Edward I of England|Edward I]]'s men, and before long Moray had secured Moray, leaving him free to turn his attention to the rest of the northeast of Scotland.<ref name=bbc/><ref name=scot/>\n\nWilliam Wallace rose to prominence in May 1297, when he [[Action at Lanark|killed Sir William Haselrig]], the English sheriff of [[Lanark]], and members of his garrison at Lanark. It is possible Sir Richard Lundie helped in the attack.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Broun|first1=Dauvit|title=New Information on the Guardians' appointment in 1286 and on Wallace's Rising in 1297|url=http://www.breakingofbritain.ac.uk/blogs/feature-of-the-month/september-2011-the-guardians-in-1286-and-wallaces-uprising-in-1297/|website=Breaking of Britain|accessdate=2015-05-19}}</ref> When news of Wallace's attack on the English rippled throughout Scotland, men rallied to him. The rebels were supported by [[Robert Wishart]], Bishop of Glasgow, who longed for the defeat of the English. The blessing of Wishart gave Wallace and his soldiers a degree of respectability. Previously, Scottish nobles had considered them mere outlaws. He was soon joined by Sir [[William the Hardy, Lord of Douglas|William Douglas]] and others.<ref name=bbc/><ref name=scot/>\n\nIn early June, Wallace and Douglas planned a symbolic strike to liberate [[Scone, Scotland|Scone]], the seat of the English-appointed [[Justiciar]] of Scotland, [[William de Ormesby]]. It was from Scone, a site held sacred by the Scots, that Ormesby had been dispensing English justice. Ormesby was forewarned of Wallace's imminent assault and hastily fled.<ref name=bbc/><ref name=scot/>\n\nOn hearing about the start of an aristocratic uprising, Edward I, although engaged in events in France, sent a force of foot soldiers and horsemen under Sir [[Henry de Percy, 1st Baron Percy|Henry Percy]] and Sir [[Robert de Clifford, 1st Baron de Clifford|Robert Clifford]] to resolve the \"Scottish problem\". On receiving reports that Sir William Douglas had defected to the rebels, Edward dispatched [[Robert I of Scotland|Robert Bruce]], Earl of Carrick, together with his father's vassals of Annandale, to attack Douglas's stronghold in [[Lanarkshire]]. Whilst traveling north to face Douglas, Bruce began to think about where his loyalties truly lay. He decided to follow the Scottish cause, being quoted as saying, \"No man holds his flesh and blood in hatred, and I am no exception. I must join my own people and the nation in whom I was born.\"{{cn|date=March 2019}}\n\nThe confederacy of men that Bruce joined included [[James Stewart, 5th High Steward of Scotland|James the Steward]], Robert Wishart, Bishop of Glasgow and William Douglas. Dissension broke out in the Scottish camp when the Scottish and English armies met in July 1297 near [[Irvine, Ayrshire|Irvine]]. The aristocratic revolt apparently halted before it even started, but its leaders led long and futile negotiations. It has been suggested that this was a deliberate move in order to provide space and time for Wallace to levy and train men.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Barrow|first1=G.W.S|title=Robert Bruce and the Community of the Realm of Scotland|location=Edinburgh|pages=108ff}}</ref> Percy and Clifford assumed that this was the end of the problem and retired back to the south, only to be followed once more by Wallace and Moray. These two divided their forces and in a short time again forced the English south of the Forth, leaving them holding only the castle of [[Dundee]].<ref name=bbc/><ref name=scot/>\n\nWhile laying siege to Dundee Castle, Wallace heard that an English army was again advancing north, this time under [[John de Warenne, 6th Earl of Surrey|John de Warenne, Earl of Surrey]]. Wallace put the leading men of the town of Dundee in charge of the castle's siege and moved to halt the advance of the English army. Wallace and Moray, who had recently combined their forces, deployed on the [[Ochil Hills]] overlooking the bridge crossing the [[River Forth]] at Stirling and prepared to meet the English in battle. \n\nAt the time, Wallace and Moray were both in their late twenties and neither could yet claim to be Scottish national heroes. Whereas some of the Scottish nobility had given in to English demands for allegiance (whilst still supporting the Scottish cause), Wallace's force remained unequivocally dedicated to the struggle for Scottish independence.<ref name=bbc/><ref name=scot/>\n\n=== Stirling Bridge and Guardian of Scotland ===\n[[File:Stirling Bridge and the Abbey Craig.JPG|thumb|300px|The site of the battle of [[Stirling Bridge]]]]\n\nOn 11 September 1297, Scottish forces, under the joint command of Moray and Wallace, met the Earl of Surrey's army, at the [[Battle of Stirling Bridge]]. The Scottish army deployed to the north-east of the bridge, and let the vanguard of Surrey's army cross eh bridge before attacking. The English [[cavalry]] proved ineffective on the boggy ground around the bridge, and many of them were killed. The bridge collapsed when English reinforcements were crossing. The English on the opposite side of the river then fled the battlefield. The Scots suffered relatively light casualties, but the death from wounds of Andrew Moray dealt a profound blow to the Scottish cause. Stirling Bridge was the first key victory for the Scots.<ref name=bbc/><ref name=scot/>\n\nAfter clearing the English out of Scotland, Wallace turned his mind to the administration of the country. One of his early intentions was to reestablish commercial and diplomatic ties with Europe and win back the overseas trade which Scotland had enjoyed under [[Alexander III of Scotland|Alexander III]]. Any evidence of his administrative acumen was probably destroyed by Edward's officials after his execution{{Citation needed|date=September 2009}}. There is, however, one Latin document in the archives of the Hanseatic town of [[L\u00fcbeck]], which was sent on 11 October 1297 by \"Andrew de Moray and William Wallace, leaders of the kingdom of Scotland and the community of the realm.\" It told the merchants of L\u00fcbeck and Hamburg that they now had free access to all parts of the kingdom of Scotland, which had, by favour of God, been recovered by war from the English.<ref name=bbc/><ref name=scot/>\n\nOnly one week after this document was signed, Wallace picked up the sword to mount an invasion of England. Crossing into [[Northumberland]], the Scots followed the English army fleeing south in disarray. Caught between two armies, hundreds of refugees fled to safety behind the walls of Newcastle. The Scots laid waste a swathe of countryside before wheeling west into Cumberland and pillaging all the way to [[Cockermouth]], before Wallace led his men back into Northumberland and fired 700 villages. On his return from England, laden with booty, Wallace found himself at the pinnacle of his power.<ref name=bbc/><ref name=scot/>\n\nIn March 1298, Wallace was knighted, reputedly by one of the leading nobles of Scotland, and was appointed [[Guardian of Scotland|Guardian of the Kingdom of Scotland]] in the name of the exiled King John Balliol. He began preparations for what must surely follow: a confrontation with Edward.<ref name=bbc/><ref name=scot/>\n\nIn January 1298, [[Philip IV of France]] had signed a truce with Edward that did not include Scotland, thereby deserting his Scots allies. Edward returned to England from campaigning in France in March and called for his army to assemble. He moved the seat of government to York.\n\nOn 3 July he invaded Scotland, intending to crush Wallace and all those daring to assert Scotland's independence. On 22 July, Edward's army attacked a much smaller Scottish force led by Wallace near [[Falkirk]]. The English army had a technological advantage. [[English longbow|Longbowmen]] slaughtered Wallace's spearmen and cavalry by firing scores of arrows over great distances. Many Scots were killed at the [[Battle of Falkirk (1298)|Battle of Falkirk]]. (It is impossible to give a precise number of the dead.) Despite the victory, Edward and his army soon returned to England and thus failed to subdue Scotland completely. \n\nBut the defeat had ruined Wallace's military reputation. He retreated to thick woods nearby and resigned his guardianship in December.\n\n=== From Falkirk to execution ===\nWallace was succeeded as Guardian of the Kingdom jointly by [[Robert the Bruce|Robert Bruce]] and [[John III Comyn, Lord of Badenoch|John Comyn]], but they could not see past their personal differences. This brought another shift in the political situation. During 1299, diplomatic pressure from France and Rome persuaded Edward to release the imprisoned King John into the custody of the Pope. The papacy also condemned Edward's invasions and occupation of Scotland in the [[Papal Bull]] ''[[Scimus Fili|Scimus, Fili]]''. The bull ordered Edward to desist his attacks and start negotiations with Scotland. However, Edward ignored the bull.<ref name=bbc/><ref name=scot/>\n\nWilliam Wallace was sent to Europe to try to gain further support for the Scottish cause. Wallace went to France to seek the aid of Philip IV, and he possibly went on to Rome. [[William Lamberton]], Bishop of St Andrews, was appointed as a third, neutral Guardian to try to maintain order between Bruce and Comyn. The Scots also recaptured Stirling Castle.<ref name=bbc/><ref name=scot/>\n\nIn May 1300, Edward I led a campaign into Scotland, invading [[Annandale]] and [[Galloway]]. Edward I's invasion force in the 1300 border campaign is one of the best-documented English armies of the medieval period. The king issued summons in December 1299 asking for feudal service from his magnates across the realm (with the exception of Wales, which Edward stated 'have leave to remain home, because of all the great work they have done in our service in the past'). The roll recording for the army showed that 40 knights and 366 mounted serjeants responded to this request with unpaid service, with a serjeant being counted as equal in worth to one half of a knight. Also accompanying them was 850 paid househeld men, mostly from the royal household. Several earls, such as the [[Gilbert de Clare, 8th Earl of Gloucester|Earl of Gloucester]] and the [[Henry de Lacy, 3rd Earl of Lincoln|Earl of Lincoln]], showed up in person, but most did not. The cavalry were divided into four battalions, each consisting of 15-20 bannerets (60-80 total), each in command of on average 13 knights and squires (780-1,040 total).\nEdward also requested 16,000 infantry from his magnates, but was only able to muster 9,000 infantry, giving his army a total count of around 10,000. The infantry were grouped into units of 100, each commanded by an armored serjeant, were further subdivided into units of 20. The average daily rate of pay was 2d (one twopence) for a spearman or billman, 12d (one shilling) for a serjeant, 24d (two shillings) for a knight,<ref>Prestwich, Michael. \"Edward I.\" Yale University Press, 1997. Page 484-486.</ref><Ref>Christopher, Candy. \"An Exercise in Frustration: The Scottish Campaign of Edward I, 1300.\" Durhan, 1999.

To do this required further campaigning, eliminating the last opposition and securing castles that were (or would be) centres of resistance. The English took control of [[Caerlaverock Castle]], but apart from some small skirmishes, there was no action. In August, the Pope sent a letter demanding that Edward withdraw from Scotland. Due to the lack of success, Edward arranged a truce with the Scots on 30 October and returned to England.<ref name=bbc/><ref name=scot/>\n\nThat year, Robert Bruce finally resigned as joint guardian and was replaced by Sir [[Ingram de Umfraville]]. In May 1301, de Umfraville, John Comyn and William Lamberton resigned as joint guardians and were replaced by Sir [[John de Soules (died 1310)|John de Soulis]] as sole guardian. Soulis was appointed largely because he was not part of either the Bruce or the Comyn camps, and was a patriot. He was an active guardian, and made renewed efforts to have John Balliol returned to the Scottish throne.<ref name=bbc/><ref name=scot/>\n\nIn July 1301, Edward launched his sixth campaign into Scotland, aiming to conquer Scotland in a two-pronged attack. One army was commanded by his son, [[Edward II of England|Edward, Prince of Wales]], the other, the larger, was under his own command. The prince was to take the southwestern lands and the greater glory, so his father hoped. But the prince held cautiously to the Solway coast. Scot forces, commanded by de Soulis and de Umfraville, attacked the prince's army at [[Lochmaben]] in early September and maintained contact with his army as it captured Robert the Bruce's Turnberry Castle. They also threatened the king's army at [[Bothwell]], which he captured in September. The two English armies met to winter at [[Linlithgow]] without having damaged the Scots' fighting ability. In January 1302, Edward agreed to a nine-month truce.<ref name=bbc/><ref name=scot/>\n[[File:William Wallace statue, Scottish National Portrait Gallery, Edinburgh.JPG|thumb|left|180px|Wallace statue by D. W. Stevenson on the Scottish National Portrait Gallery, [[Edinburgh]]]]\n\nIt was around this time that Robert the Bruce, along with other nobles, gave his allegiance to Edward I, even though he had been on the side of the patriots until then. There are many reasons that may have prompted his turning. Not the least of them possibly was that Bruce found it loathsome to continue sacrificing his followers, family and inheritance for the exiled Scottish king John Balliol. There were rumours that Balliol would return with a French army and regain the Scottish throne. Soulis supported the return of Balliol as did many other nobles, but the return of John as king would lead to the Bruces losing any chance of ever gaining the throne themselves. Also, Robert's father was old and ill, and may have wished his son to seek peace with Edward, who, he was convinced, would eventually be victorious over the Scots. The elder Bruce would have seen that, if the rebellion failed and his son were against Edward, he would lose everything; titles, lands, and probably his life. Edward also had come to see that he needed a Scottish noble like Bruce as a friend, rather than as an enemy. He was facing both excommunication by the Pope for his actions and a possible invasion by the French.<ref name=bbc/><ref name=scot/>\n\nRobet the Bruce's defection to the English king's side was not total. He sent a letter to the monks at [[Melrose Abbey]] in March 1302 that effectively weakened his usefulness to the English king. Apologizing for having called the monks to service in his army when there had been no national call up, Bruce pledged that, henceforth, he would \"never again\" require the monks to serve unless it was to \"the common army of the whole realm,\" for national defence.<ref name=bbc/><ref name=scot/>\n\nMore serious to the Scottish patriots than the apparent defection of Bruce was the loss of support from Philip IV of France and subsequently, the Pope. Philip faced revolt at home and became too involved in his own difficulties to care about the Scots. He thus created a schism between the Scots' cause and the Pope, The Pope's support for the Scots faded without Philip's influence. It seemed that Philip had such difficulties that he signed a peace treaty with Edward that did not include any protection for the Scots. This act the Scots knew spelled their doom. A powerful Scottish delegation, led by Soulis, went to Paris that autumn to try to head off such an event. In his absence, Comyn was appointed as Guardian.<ref name=bbc/><ref name=scot/>\n\nIn November 1302, when the temporary truce between the Scots and the English ended, Edward delayed calling up his army until spring. Over that winter, however, he sent [[Sir John Segrave]] and an army on a scouting expedition into the area west of Edinburgh. They were ambushed by Comyn and [[Simon Fraser (d. 1306)|Simon Fraser]], who had ridden all night to meet them. The Scots attack led to the capture of the severely wounded Segrave and, although his army later rescued him, the Scots were exultant at their victory. Their successes, however, were rendered useless when, in May 1303, Philip formally signed [[Treaty of Paris (1303)|a peace with England]] and omitted any consideration for the Scots.\n\nEdward I was now free from embarrassment abroad and at home, and having made preparations for the final conquest of Scotland, he commenced his invasion in the middle of May 1303. His army was arranged in two divisions\u2014one under himself and the other under the Prince of Wales. Edward advanced in the east and his son entered Scotland by the west, but his advance was checked at several points by Wallace. King Edward reached [[Edinburgh]] by June, then marched by [[Linlithgow]] and Stirling to Perth. Comyn, with the small force under his command, could not hope to defeat Edward's forces. Edward stayed in Perth until July, then proceeded, via [[Dundee]], [[Montrose, Angus|Montrose]] and [[Brechin]], to [[Aberdeen]], arriving in August. From there, he marched through Moray, before his progress continued to [[Badenoch]], before re-tracing his path back south to [[Dunfermline]], where he stayed through the winter.\n\nEarly in 1304, Edward sent a raiding party into the borders, which put to flight the forces under Fraser and Wallace. With the country now under submission, all the leading Scots surrendered to Edward in February, except for Wallace, Fraser, and Soulis, who was in France. Terms of submission were negotiated on 9 February by John Comyn, who refused to surrender unconditionally, but asked that prisoners of both sides be released by ransom and that Edward agree there would be no reprisals or disinheritance of the Scots. The laws and liberties of Scotland would be as they had been in the day of Alexander III, and any that needed alteration would be with the advice of Edward and the advice and assent of the Scots nobles.<ref name=bbc/><ref name=scot/>\n\nExcepting William Wallace and John de Soulis, it seemed that all would be forgiven after some of the more famous leaders were exiled from Scotland for various periods. Forfeited estates could be recovered by payment of fines levied in amounts deemed appropriate for each individual's betrayal. Inheritances would continue as they always had, allowing the [[landed nobility]] to pass on titles and properties as normal.\n\nDe Soulis remained abroad, refusing to surrender. Wallace was still at large in Scotland and, unlike all the nobles and bishops, refused to pay homage to Edward. Edward needed to make an example of someone, and, by refusing to capitulate and accept his country's occupation and annexation, Wallace became the unfortunate focus of Edward's hatred. He would be granted no peace unless he put himself utterly and absolutely under Edward's will. It was also decreed that James Stewart, de Soulis and Sir Ingram de Umfraville could not return until Wallace was given up, and Comyn, Alexander Lindsay, David Graham and Simon Fraser were to actively seek his capture.\n\nIn May, having eliminated most Scottish opposition, Edward turned his attention to Stirling Castle, laying siege to it with great determination. Asked by its defender, Sir William Oliphant, if he had permission to surrender or must hold the castle, Edward refused, saying, \"If he thinks it will be better for him to defend the castle than yield it, he will see.\" After three months of bombardment with every [[siege engine]] Edward could bring to bear, the defenders still held the castle. When they could hold out no longer, they offered to surrender unconditionally, but Edward refused to accept. He would first bombard the castle with \"[[Warwolf]],\" his new [[trebuchet]]. After a day, the defenders of the destroyed castle were allowed to submit; about fifty men surrendered.\n\nMeantime, while Robert Bruce outwardly maintained his loyalty to Edward, he was secretly advancing his own ambition and, while assisting Edward in the settlement of the Scottish government, on 11 June 1304, with both of them having witnessed the efforts of their countrymen at Stirling, Bruce and William Lamberton made a pact that bound them, each to the other, in \"friendship and alliance against all men.\" If one should break the secret pact, he would forfeit to the other the sum of ten thousand pounds. Though both had already surrendered to the English, the pact signaled their commitment to their future perseverance for the Scots and their independence. They now intended to bide their time until the death of the elderly king of England.<ref name=bbc/><ref name=scot/>\n\nScotland lay defenseless and Edward set about amalgamating her into England. Homage was again paid to Edward by the nobles, and a parliament was held in May 1305 to elect those who would meet later in the year with the English parliament to establish rules for the governance of Scotland by the English. The Earl of Richmond, Edward's nephew, was to head the subordinate government of Scotland and control the castles of [[Roxburgh]] and [[Jedburgh]]. Justices were to be appointed in pairs, one Englishman and one Scot. Militarily strategic localities were to be controlled by English sheriffs and constables, but most others by Scots. A council was formed to advise the Earl of Richmond, including Bruce, Comyn and Lamberton. For all the apparent participation by Scots in the government, however, the English held the real power.\n\nWhile all this took place, William Wallace was finally captured at [[Robroyston]] near Glasgow on 3 August 1305. He was delivered to the English by retainers in the service of Sir [[John de Menteith|John Menteith]]. Wallace had been easily the most hunted man in Scotland for years, but especially for the past eighteen months.\n\nHe was quickly taken through the Scottish countryside, his legs bound beneath his horse, towards London, where, after a [[show trial]], the English authorities had him executed on 23 August 1305, at the Elms of Smithfield in the traditional manner for a traitor. He was [[Hanged, drawn and quartered|hanged, then drawn and quartered]], and his head placed on a spike on [[London Bridge]]. The English government displayed his limbs separately in Newcastle, Berwick, Stirling, and Perth.\n\n== Robert the Bruce, King of Scots ==\n[[File:Full of new hope Bruce sprang to land.jpg|thumb|Full of new hope Bruce sprang to land]]\n=== The Dumfries spark ===\nOn 15 September, the English parliament met with the Scottish representatives to decide the ordinances of government for Scotland. In the midst of listing punishments to be meted out to other Scots, Edward ordered Robert Bruce to put his [[Kildrummy Castle|castle at Kildrummy]] \"in the keeping of such a man as he himself will be willing to answer for.\" This suggests that Edward suspected Robert was not entirely trustworthy and may have been plotting behind his back. Bruce, as Earl of Carrick and now 7th Lord of Annandale, held huge estates and property in both Scotland and England, and had a claim to the Scottish throne. He also had a large family to protect. In addition to his wife Elizabeth and daughter Marjory, there were his brothers, Edward, Alexander, Thomas and Nigel, his sisters, Christian, [[Isabel Bruce|Isabel (Queen of Norway)]], Margaret, Matilda and Mary, and his nephews [[Domhnall II, Earl of Mar]] and [[Thomas Randolph, 1st Earl of Moray|Thomas Randolph]]. If he claimed the throne, he would throw the country into yet another series of wars.<ref name=bbc/><ref name=scot/>\n\nThe pact which Bruce had made with Lamberton was not so secretly managed, and suspicions were awakened. This led to a conference with Comyn in which Bruce proposed, as the best means of preventing future trouble and for restoring their own privileges and the rights of Scots, that they should henceforward enter into an understanding with each other. Under this, Comyn would support Bruce's claim to the throne and receive Bruce's lands as compensation or vice versa. For some unknown motive, probably a desire to ruin his rival, Comyn revealed the conspiracy to Edward. Bruce was at the English court at this time and, after being forewarned, fled back to Scotland.<ref name=bbc/><ref name=scot/>\n\nBruce arrived in [[Dumfries]] and found Comyn there. At a private meeting with Comyn on 6 February 1306 at the Greyfriars Church, Bruce reproached Comyn for his treachery, which Comyn denied. Furious, Bruce drew his dagger and stabbed, though not mortally, his betrayer. As Bruce ran from the church, his attendants, Kirkpatrick and Lindsay, entered and, finding Comyn still alive, killed him. Bruce and his followers then forced the local English judges to surrender their castle. Bruce realised that the die had been cast and that he had no alternative except to become either a king or a fugitive. The murder of Comyn was an act of sacrilege, and he faced a future as an excommunicate and an outlaw. However his pact with Lamberton and the support of the Scottish church, who were prepared to take his side in defiance of [[Roman Catholic Church|Rome]], proved to be of great importance at this key moment when Bruce asserted his claim to the Scottish throne.<ref name=bbc/><ref name=scot/>\n\n=== Coronation ===\n[[File:Robert the Bruce and Gilies Hill.jpg|thumb|260px|Statue of Robert the Bruce at [[Bannockburn]]]]\nHe went to [[Glasgow]] and met with the Bishop of Glasgow, Robert Wishart. Rather than excommunicate Bruce, Wishart absolved him and urged people to rise in his support. They both then travelled to Scone, where they were met by Lamberton and other prominent churchmen and nobles. Less than seven weeks after the killing in Dumfries, at Scone Abbey on 25 March 1306, Robert Bruce was crowned as [[List of Scottish monarchs|King]] [[Robert the Bruce|Robert I of Scotland]].<ref name=bbc/><ref name=scot/>\n\nHe then began a new campaign to free his kingdom. After being defeated in [[Battle of Methven|battle]], he was driven from the Scottish mainland as an outlaw, with his wife, three of his brothers, his sisters, and daughter captured by English. All three of his brothers were hanged, drawn and quartered. Bruce later came out of hiding in 1307. The Scots thronged to him, and he defeated the English in a number of battles. His forces continued to grow in strength, encouraged in part by the death of Edward I in July 1307. The [[Battle of Bannockburn]] in 1314 was an especially important Scottish victory, after which English released the female relatives of Bruce for exchange.\n\nIn 1320, the [[Declaration of Arbroath]] was signed by the community of the realm of Scotland and sent to the [[Pope]] affirming Scottish independence from England. In 1327, [[Edward II of England]] was deposed and killed. The invasion of the North of England by Robert the Bruce forced [[Edward III of England]] to sign the [[Treaty of Edinburgh-Northampton]] on 1 May 1328, which recognised the independence of Scotland with Bruce as King. To further seal the peace, Robert's son and heir [[David II of Scotland|David]] married the sister of Edward III.\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Wars of Scottish Independence]]\n* [[Second War of Scottish Independence]]\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{Use dmy dates|date=August 2011}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:War Of Scottish Independence 01}}\n[[Category:Wars of Scottish Independence|.01]]\n[[Category:13th century in Scotland]]\n[[Category:13th-century military history of the Kingdom of England]]\n[[Category:14th century in Scotland]]\n[[Category:Warfare in medieval Scotland]]\n[[Category:14th-century military history of Scotland]]\n", "text_old": "{{Infobox military conflict\n| conflict    = First War of Scottish Independence\n| width       = \n| partof      = the [[Wars of Scottish Independence]]\n| image       = Battle of Bannockburn - Bruce addresses troops.jpg\n| image_size  = \n| alt         = \n| caption     = Robert the Bruce addresses his troops before the [[Battle of Bannockburn]].

The war was given that name retroactively many centuries later, after the [[American War of Independence]] made the term popular.\n\n== Background ==\nWhen King [[Alexander III of Scotland|Alexander III]]<ref>(Medieval Gaelic: Alaxandair mac Alaxandair; Modern Gaelic: Alasdair mac Alasdair)</ref> ruled Scotland, his reign had seen a period of peace and economic stability. On 19 March 1286, however, Alexander died after falling from his horse. The heir to the throne was Alexander's granddaughter, [[Margaret, Maid of Norway]]. As she was still a child and in Norway, the Scottish lords set up a government of guardians.  Margaret fell ill on the voyage to Scotland and died in Orkney on 26 September 1290. The lack of a clear heir led to a period known as [[Competitors for the Crown of Scotland]] or the \"Great Cause\", with several families laying claim to the throne.\n\nWith Scotland threatening to descend into civil war, King [[Edward I of England]] was invited in by the Scottish nobility to arbitrate. Before the process could begin, he insisted that all of the contenders recognise him as [[Lord Paramount of Scotland]]. In early November 1292, at a great feudal court held in the castle at [[Berwick-upon-Tweed]], judgement was given in favour of [[John Balliol]] having the strongest claim in law.\n\nEdward proceeded to reverse the rulings of the Scottish Lords and even summoned King John Balliol to stand before the English court as a common plaintiff. John was a weak king, known as \"Toom Tabard\" or \"Empty Coat\". John renounced his [[Homage (feudal)|homage]] in March 1296. \n\nThat same month Edward [[English invasion of Scotland (1296)|invaded Scotland]] and stormed Berwick-upon-Tweed, sacking the then-Scottish border town.  In April, the Scots were defeated at the [[Battle of Dunbar (1296)|Battle of Dunbar]] in [[East Lothian]]. By July, Edward had forced John to abdicate. Edward instructed his officers to receive formal homage from some 1,800 Scottish nobles (many of the rest being prisoners of war at that time).\n\n== Andrew Moray and William Wallace ==\n\n=== Rise of Moray and Wallace ===\n[[File:Wallace statue, Lanark.JPG|thumb|120px|Wallace statue, Lanark]]\n\nThroughout Scotland, there was widespread discontent and disorder after the English Crown extended its dominion over Scotland. Acts of defiance were targeted at local English officials. In 1297, the country erupted in open revolt. [[Andrew Moray|Andrew de Moray]] and [[William Wallace]] emerged as the first significant Scottish patriots.<ref name=bbc/><ref name=scot/>\n\nAndrew de Moray was the son of a northern landowner, Sir [[Andrew Moray (justiciar)|Andrew de Moray of Petty]]. Andrew and his father were both captured in the rout after the [[Battle of Dunbar (1296)|Battle of Dunbar]] in April 1296. Andrew the younger was initially held captive in [[Chester Castle]] on the Anglo-Welsh border, from which he escaped during the winter of 1296\u201397. He returned to his father's castle at [[Avoch]] on the northern shore of the [[Moray Firth]], where he raised his banner in the name of Scotland's king, [[John Balliol]]. Moray quickly gathered a band of like-minded patriots, and employing hit-and-run guerrilla tactics, began to attack and devastate every English-garrisoned castle from Banff to [[Inverness]]. The entire province of [[Moray]] was soon in revolt against King [[Edward I of England|Edward I]]'s men, and before long Moray had secured Moray, leaving him free to turn his attention to the rest of the northeast of Scotland.<ref name=bbc/><ref name=scot/>\n\nWilliam Wallace rose to prominence in May 1297, when he [[Action at Lanark|killed Sir William Haselrig]], the English sheriff of [[Lanark]], and members of his garrison at Lanark. It is possible Sir Richard Lundie helped in the attack.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Broun|first1=Dauvit|title=New Information on the Guardians' appointment in 1286 and on Wallace's Rising in 1297|url=http://www.breakingofbritain.ac.uk/blogs/feature-of-the-month/september-2011-the-guardians-in-1286-and-wallaces-uprising-in-1297/|website=Breaking of Britain|accessdate=2015-05-19}}</ref> When news of Wallace's attack on the English rippled throughout Scotland, men rallied to him. The rebels were supported by [[Robert Wishart]], Bishop of Glasgow, who longed for the defeat of the English. The blessing of Wishart gave Wallace and his soldiers a degree of respectability. Previously, Scottish nobles had considered them mere outlaws. He was soon joined by Sir [[William the Hardy, Lord of Douglas|William Douglas]] and others.<ref name=bbc/><ref name=scot/>\n\nIn early June, Wallace and Douglas planned a symbolic strike to liberate [[Scone, Scotland|Scone]], the seat of the English-appointed [[Justiciar]] of Scotland, [[William de Ormesby]]. It was from Scone, a site held sacred by the Scots, that Ormesby had been dispensing English justice. Ormesby was forewarned of Wallace's imminent assault and hastily fled.<ref name=bbc/><ref name=scot/>\n\nOn hearing about the start of an aristocratic uprising, Edward I, although engaged in events in France, sent a force of foot soldiers and horsemen under Sir [[Henry de Percy, 1st Baron Percy|Henry Percy]] and Sir [[Robert de Clifford, 1st Baron de Clifford|Robert Clifford]] to resolve the \"Scottish problem\". On receiving reports that Sir William Douglas had defected to the rebels, Edward dispatched [[Robert I of Scotland|Robert Bruce]], Earl of Carrick, together with his father's vassals of Annandale, to attack Douglas's stronghold in [[Lanarkshire]]. Whilst traveling north to face Douglas, Bruce began to think about where his loyalties truly lay. He decided to follow the Scottish cause, being quoted as saying, \"No man holds his flesh and blood in hatred, and I am no exception. I must join my own people and the nation in whom I was born.\"{{cn|date=March 2019}}\n\nThe confederacy of men that Bruce joined included [[James Stewart, 5th High Steward of Scotland|James the Steward]], Robert Wishart, Bishop of Glasgow and William Douglas. Dissension broke out in the Scottish camp when the Scottish and English armies met in July 1297 near [[Irvine, Ayrshire|Irvine]]. The aristocratic revolt apparently halted before it even started, but its leaders led long and futile negotiations. It has been suggested that this was a deliberate move in order to provide space and time for Wallace to levy and train men.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Barrow|first1=G.W.S|title=Robert Bruce and the Community of the Realm of Scotland|location=Edinburgh|pages=108ff}}</ref> Percy and Clifford assumed that this was the end of the problem and retired back to the south, only to be followed once more by Wallace and Moray. These two divided their forces and in a short time again forced the English south of the Forth, leaving them holding only the castle of [[Dundee]].<ref name=bbc/><ref name=scot/>\n\nWhile laying siege to Dundee Castle, Wallace heard that an English army was again advancing north, this time under [[John de Warenne, 6th Earl of Surrey|John de Warenne, Earl of Surrey]]. Wallace put the leading men of the town of Dundee in charge of the castle's siege and moved to halt the advance of the English army. Wallace and Moray, who had recently combined their forces, deployed on the [[Ochil Hills]] overlooking the bridge crossing the [[River Forth]] at Stirling and prepared to meet the English in battle. \n\nAt the time, Wallace and Moray were both in their late twenties and neither could yet claim to be Scottish national heroes. Whereas some of the Scottish nobility had given in to English demands for allegiance (whilst still supporting the Scottish cause), Wallace's force remained unequivocally dedicated to the struggle for Scottish independence.<ref name=bbc/><ref name=scot/>\n\n=== Stirling Bridge and Guardian of Scotland ===\n[[File:Stirling Bridge and the Abbey Craig.JPG|thumb|300px|The site of the battle of [[Stirling Bridge]]]]\n\nOn 11 September 1297, Scottish forces, under the joint command of Moray and Wallace, met the Earl of Surrey's army, at the [[Battle of Stirling Bridge]]. The Scottish army deployed to the north-east of the bridge, and let the vanguard of Surrey's army cross eh bridge before attacking. The English [[cavalry]] proved ineffective on the boggy ground around the bridge, and many of them were killed. The bridge collapsed when English reinforcements were crossing. The English on the opposite side of the river then fled the battlefield. The Scots suffered relatively light casualties, but the death from wounds of Andrew Moray dealt a profound blow to the Scottish cause. Stirling Bridge was the first key victory for the Scots.<ref name=bbc/><ref name=scot/>\n\nAfter clearing the English out of Scotland, Wallace turned his mind to the administration of the country. One of his early intentions was to reestablish commercial and diplomatic ties with Europe and win back the overseas trade which Scotland had enjoyed under [[Alexander III of Scotland|Alexander III]]. Any evidence of his administrative acumen was probably destroyed by Edward's officials after his execution{{Citation needed|date=September 2009}}. There is, however, one Latin document in the archives of the Hanseatic town of [[L\u00fcbeck]], which was sent on 11 October 1297 by \"Andrew de Moray and William Wallace, leaders of the kingdom of Scotland and the community of the realm.\" It told the merchants of L\u00fcbeck and Hamburg that they now had free access to all parts of the kingdom of Scotland, which had, by favour of God, been recovered by war from the English.<ref name=bbc/><ref name=scot/>\n\nOnly one week after this document was signed, Wallace picked up the sword to mount an invasion of England. Crossing into [[Northumberland]], the Scots followed the English army fleeing south in disarray. Caught between two armies, hundreds of refugees fled to safety behind the walls of Newcastle. The Scots laid waste a swathe of countryside before wheeling west into Cumberland and pillaging all the way to [[Cockermouth]], before Wallace led his men back into Northumberland and fired 700 villages. On his return from England, laden with booty, Wallace found himself at the pinnacle of his power.<ref name=bbc/><ref name=scot/>\n\nIn March 1298, Wallace was knighted, reputedly by one of the leading nobles of Scotland, and was appointed [[Guardian of Scotland|Guardian of the Kingdom of Scotland]] in the name of the exiled King John Balliol. He began preparations for what must surely follow: a confrontation with Edward.<ref name=bbc/><ref name=scot/>\n\nIn January 1298, [[Philip IV of France]] had signed a truce with Edward that did not include Scotland, thereby deserting his Scots allies. Edward returned to England from campaigning in France in March and called for his army to assemble. He moved the seat of government to York.\n\nOn 3 July he invaded Scotland, intending to crush Wallace and all those daring to assert Scotland's independence. On 22 July, Edward's army attacked a much smaller Scottish force led by Wallace near [[Falkirk]]. The English army had a technological advantage. [[English longbow|Longbowmen]] slaughtered Wallace's spearmen and cavalry by firing scores of arrows over great distances. Many Scots were killed at the [[Battle of Falkirk (1298)|Battle of Falkirk]]. (It is impossible to give a precise number of the dead.) Despite the victory, Edward and his army soon returned to England and thus failed to subdue Scotland completely. \n\nBut the defeat had ruined Wallace's military reputation. He retreated to thick woods nearby and resigned his guardianship in December.\n\n=== From Falkirk to execution ===\nWallace was succeeded as Guardian of the Kingdom jointly by [[Robert the Bruce|Robert Bruce]] and [[John III Comyn, Lord of Badenoch|John Comyn]], but they could not see past their personal differences. This brought another shift in the political situation. During 1299, diplomatic pressure from France and Rome persuaded Edward to release the imprisoned King John into the custody of the Pope. The papacy also condemned Edward's invasions and occupation of Scotland in the [[Papal Bull]] ''[[Scimus Fili|Scimus, Fili]]''. The bull ordered Edward to desist his attacks and start negotiations with Scotland. However, Edward ignored the bull.<ref name=bbc/><ref name=scot/>\n\nWilliam Wallace was sent to Europe to try to gain further support for the Scottish cause. Wallace went to France to seek the aid of Philip IV, and he possibly went on to Rome. [[William Lamberton]], Bishop of St Andrews, was appointed as a third, neutral Guardian to try to maintain order between Bruce and Comyn. The Scots also recaptured Stirling Castle.<ref name=bbc/><ref name=scot/>\n\nIn May 1300, Edward I led a campaign into Scotland, invading [[Annandale]] and [[Galloway]]. Edward I's invasion force in the 1300 border campaign is one of the best-documented English armies of the medieval period. The king issued summons in December 1299 asking for feudal service from his magnates across the realm (with the exception of Wales, which Edward stated 'have leave to remain home, because of all the great work they have done in our service in the past'). The roll recording for the army showed that 40 knights and 366 mounted serjeants responded to this request with unpaid service, with a serjeant being counted as equal in worth to one half of a knight. Also accompanying them was 850 paid househeld men, mostly from the royal household. Several earls, such as the [[Gilbert de Clare, 8th Earl of Gloucester|Earl of Gloucester]] and the [[Henry de Lacy, 3rd Earl of Lincoln|Earl of Lincoln]], showed up in person, but most did not. The cavalry were divided into four battalions, each consisting of 15-20 bannerets (60-80 total), each in command of on average 13 knights and squires (780-1,040 total).\nEdward also requested 16,000 infantry from his magnates, but was only able to muster 9,000 infantry, giving his army a total count of around 10,000. The infantry were grouped into units of 100, each commanded by an armored serjeant, were further subdivided into units of 20. The average daily rate of pay was 2d (one twopence) for a spearman or billman, 12d (one shilling) for a serjeant, 24d (two shillings) for a knight,<ref>Prestwich, Michael. \"Edward I.\" Yale University Press, 1997. Page 484-486.</ref><Ref>Christopher, Candy. \"An Exercise in Frustration: The Scottish Campaign of Edward I, 1300.\" Durhan, 1999. Page 20, 26.</ref> 6d for a [[hobelar]], 6d for a mounted archer, 4-6d for a crossbowman, and 3d for a foot archer.<ref>\"Republic of Letters,\" Volume 4, page 10.</ref>\n\nWith the success of the English at Falkirk two years earlier, Edward must have felt in a position to bring Scotland under full control permanently. To do this required further campaigning, eliminating the last opposition and securing castles that were (or would be) centres of resistance. The English took control of [[Caerlaverock Castle]], but apart from some small skirmishes, there was no action. In August, the Pope sent a letter demanding that Edward withdraw from Scotland. Due to the lack of success, Edward arranged a truce with the Scots on 30 October and returned to England.<ref name=bbc/><ref name=scot/>\n\nThat year, Robert Bruce finally resigned as joint guardian and was replaced by Sir [[Ingram de Umfraville]]. In May 1301, de Umfraville, John Comyn and William Lamberton resigned as joint guardians and were replaced by Sir [[John de Soules (died 1310)|John de Soulis]] as sole guardian. Soulis was appointed largely because he was not part of either the Bruce or the Comyn camps, and was a patriot. He was an active guardian, and made renewed efforts to have John Balliol returned to the Scottish throne.<ref name=bbc/><ref name=scot/>\n\nIn July 1301, Edward launched his sixth campaign into Scotland, aiming to conquer Scotland in a two-pronged attack. One army was commanded by his son, [[Edward II of England|Edward, Prince of Wales]], the other, the larger, was under his own command. The prince was to take the southwestern lands and the greater glory, so his father hoped. But the prince held cautiously to the Solway coast. Scot forces, commanded by de Soulis and de Umfraville, attacked the prince's army at [[Lochmaben]] in early September and maintained contact with his army as it captured Robert the Bruce's Turnberry Castle. They also threatened the king's army at [[Bothwell]], which he captured in September. The two English armies met to winter at [[Linlithgow]] without having damaged the Scots' fighting ability. In January 1302, Edward agreed to a nine-month truce.<ref name=bbc/><ref name=scot/>\n[[File:William Wallace statue, Scottish National Portrait Gallery, Edinburgh.JPG|thumb|left|180px|Wallace statue by D. W. Stevenson on the Scottish National Portrait Gallery, [[Edinburgh]]]]\n\nIt was around this time that Robert the Bruce, along with other nobles, gave his allegiance to Edward I, even though he had been on the side of the patriots until then. There are many reasons that may have prompted his turning. Not the least of them possibly was that Bruce found it loathsome to continue sacrificing his followers, family and inheritance for the exiled Scottish king John Balliol. There were rumours that Balliol would return with a French army and regain the Scottish throne. Soulis supported the return of Balliol as did many other nobles, but the return of John as king would lead to the Bruces losing any chance of ever gaining the throne themselves. Also, Robert's father was old and ill, and may have wished his son to seek peace with Edward, who, he was convinced, would eventually be victorious over the Scots. The elder Bruce would have seen that, if the rebellion failed and his son were against Edward, he would lose everything; titles, lands, and probably his life. Edward also had come to see that he needed a Scottish noble like Bruce as a friend, rather than as an enemy. He was facing both excommunication by the Pope for his actions and a possible invasion by the French.<ref name=bbc/><ref name=scot/>\n\nRobet the Bruce's defection to the English king's side was not total. He sent a letter to the monks at [[Melrose Abbey]] in March 1302 that effectively weakened his usefulness to the English king. Apologizing for having called the monks to service in his army when there had been no national call up, Bruce pledged that, henceforth, he would \"never again\" require the monks to serve unless it was to \"the common army of the whole realm,\" for national defence.<ref name=bbc/><ref name=scot/>\n\nMore serious to the Scottish patriots than the apparent defection of Bruce was the loss of support from Philip IV of France and subsequently, the Pope. Philip faced revolt at home and became too involved in his own difficulties to care about the Scots. He thus created a schism between the Scots' cause and the Pope, The Pope's support for the Scots faded without Philip's influence. It seemed that Philip had such difficulties that he signed a peace treaty with Edward that did not include any protection for the Scots. This act the Scots knew spelled their doom. A powerful Scottish delegation, led by Soulis, went to Paris that autumn to try to head off such an event. In his absence, Comyn was appointed as Guardian.<ref name=bbc/><ref name=scot/>\n\nIn November 1302, when the temporary truce between the Scots and the English ended, Edward delayed calling up his army until spring. Over that winter, however, he sent [[Sir John Segrave]] and an army on a scouting expedition into the area west of Edinburgh. They were ambushed by Comyn and [[Simon Fraser (d. 1306)|Simon Fraser]], who had ridden all night to meet them. The Scots attack led to the capture of the severely wounded Segrave and, although his army later rescued him, the Scots were exultant at their victory. Their successes, however, were rendered useless when, in May 1303, Philip formally signed [[Treaty of Paris (1303)|a peace with England]] and omitted any consideration for the Scots.\n\nEdward I was now free from embarrassment abroad and at home, and having made preparations for the final conquest of Scotland, he commenced his invasion in the middle of May 1303. His army was arranged in two divisions\u2014one under himself and the other under the Prince of Wales. Edward advanced in the east and his son entered Scotland by the west, but his advance was checked at several points by Wallace. King Edward reached [[Edinburgh]] by June, then marched by [[Linlithgow]] and Stirling to Perth. Comyn, with the small force under his command, could not hope to defeat Edward's forces. Edward stayed in Perth until July, then proceeded, via [[Dundee]], [[Montrose, Angus|Montrose]] and [[Brechin]], to [[Aberdeen]], arriving in August. From there, he marched through Moray, before his progress continued to [[Badenoch]], before re-tracing his path back south to [[Dunfermline]], where he stayed through the winter.\n\nEarly in 1304, Edward sent a raiding party into the borders, which put to flight the forces under Fraser and Wallace. With the country now under submission, all the leading Scots surrendered to Edward in February, except for Wallace, Fraser, and Soulis, who was in France. Terms of submission were negotiated on 9 February by John Comyn, who refused to surrender unconditionally, but asked that prisoners of both sides be released by ransom and that Edward agree there would be no reprisals or disinheritance of the Scots. The laws and liberties of Scotland would be as they had been in the day of Alexander III, and any that needed alteration would be with the advice of Edward and the advice and assent of the Scots nobles.<ref name=bbc/><ref name=scot/>\n\nExcepting William Wallace and John de Soulis, it seemed that all would be forgiven after some of the more famous leaders were exiled from Scotland for various periods. Forfeited estates could be recovered by payment of fines levied in amounts deemed appropriate for each individual's betrayal. Inheritances would continue as they always had, allowing the [[landed nobility]] to pass on titles and properties as normal.\n\nDe Soulis remained abroad, refusing to surrender. Wallace was still at large in Scotland and, unlike all the nobles and bishops, refused to pay homage to Edward. Edward needed to make an example of someone, and, by refusing to capitulate and accept his country's occupation and annexation, Wallace became the unfortunate focus of Edward's hatred. He would be granted no peace unless he put himself utterly and absolutely under Edward's will. It was also decreed that James Stewart, de Soulis and Sir Ingram de Umfraville could not return until Wallace was given up, and Comyn, Alexander Lindsay, David Graham and Simon Fraser were to actively seek his capture.\n\nIn May, having eliminated most Scottish opposition, Edward turned his attention to Stirling Castle, laying siege to it with great determination. Asked by its defender, Sir William Oliphant, if he had permission to surrender or must hold the castle, Edward refused, saying, \"If he thinks it will be better for him to defend the castle than yield it, he will see.\" After three months of bombardment with every [[siege engine]] Edward could bring to bear, the defenders still held the castle. When they could hold out no longer, they offered to surrender unconditionally, but Edward refused to accept. He would first bombard the castle with \"[[Warwolf]],\" his new [[trebuchet]]. After a day, the defenders of the destroyed castle were allowed to submit; about fifty men surrendered.\n\nMeantime, while Robert Bruce outwardly maintained his loyalty to Edward, he was secretly advancing his own ambition and, while assisting Edward in the settlement of the Scottish government, on 11 June 1304, with both of them having witnessed the efforts of their countrymen at Stirling, Bruce and William Lamberton made a pact that bound them, each to the other, in \"friendship and alliance against all men.\" If one should break the secret pact, he would forfeit to the other the sum of ten thousand pounds. Though both had already surrendered to the English, the pact signaled their commitment to their future perseverance for the Scots and their independence. They now intended to bide their time until the death of the elderly king of England.<ref name=bbc/><ref name=scot/>\n\nScotland lay defenseless and Edward set about amalgamating her into England. Homage was again paid to Edward by the nobles, and a parliament was held in May 1305 to elect those who would meet later in the year with the English parliament to establish rules for the governance of Scotland by the English. The Earl of Richmond, Edward's nephew, was to head the subordinate government of Scotland and control the castles of [[Roxburgh]] and [[Jedburgh]]. Justices were to be appointed in pairs, one Englishman and one Scot. Militarily strategic localities were to be controlled by English sheriffs and constables, but most others by Scots. A council was formed to advise the Earl of Richmond, including Bruce, Comyn and Lamberton. For all the apparent participation by Scots in the government, however, the English held the real power.\n\nWhile all this took place, William Wallace was finally captured at [[Robroyston]] near Glasgow on 3 August 1305. He was delivered to the English by retainers in the service of Sir [[John de Menteith|John Menteith]]. Wallace had been easily the most hunted man in Scotland for years, but especially for the past eighteen months.\n\nHe was quickly taken through the Scottish countryside, his legs bound beneath his horse, towards London, where, after a [[show trial]], the English authorities had him executed on 23 August 1305, at the Elms of Smithfield in the traditional manner for a traitor. He was [[Hanged, drawn and quartered|hanged, then drawn and quartered]], and his head placed on a spike on [[London Bridge]]. The English government displayed his limbs separately in Newcastle, Berwick, Stirling, and Perth.\n\n== Robert the Bruce, King of Scots ==\n[[File:Full of new hope Bruce sprang to land.jpg|thumb|Full of new hope Bruce sprang to land]]\n=== The Dumfries spark ===\nOn 15 September, the English parliament met with the Scottish representatives to decide the ordinances of government for Scotland. In the midst of listing punishments to be meted out to other Scots, Edward ordered Robert Bruce to put his [[Kildrummy Castle|castle at Kildrummy]] \"in the keeping of such a man as he himself will be willing to answer for.\" This suggests that Edward suspected Robert was not entirely trustworthy and may have been plotting behind his back. Bruce, as Earl of Carrick and now 7th Lord of Annandale, held huge estates and property in both Scotland and England, and had a claim to the Scottish throne. He also had a large family to protect. In addition to his wife Elizabeth and daughter Marjory, there were his brothers, Edward, Alexander, Thomas and Nigel, his sisters, Christian, [[Isabel Bruce|Isabel (Queen of Norway)]], Margaret, Matilda and Mary, and his nephews [[Domhnall II, Earl of Mar]] and [[Thomas Randolph, 1st Earl of Moray|Thomas Randolph]]. If he claimed the throne, he would throw the country into yet another series of wars.<ref name=bbc/><ref name=scot/>\n\nThe pact which Bruce had made with Lamberton was not so secretly managed, and suspicions were awakened. This led to a conference with Comyn in which Bruce proposed, as the best means of preventing future trouble and for restoring their own privileges and the rights of Scots, that they should henceforward enter into an understanding with each other. Under this, Comyn would support Bruce's claim to the throne and receive Bruce's lands as compensation or vice versa. For some unknown motive, probably a desire to ruin his rival, Comyn revealed the conspiracy to Edward. Bruce was at the English court at this time and, after being forewarned, fled back to Scotland.<ref name=bbc/><ref name=scot/>\n\nBruce arrived in [[Dumfries]] and found Comyn there. At a private meeting with Comyn on 6 February 1306 at the Greyfriars Church, Bruce reproached Comyn for his treachery, which Comyn denied. Furious, Bruce drew his dagger and stabbed, though not mortally, his betrayer. As Bruce ran from the church, his attendants, Kirkpatrick and Lindsay, entered and, finding Comyn still alive, killed him. Bruce and his followers then forced the local English judges to surrender their castle. Bruce realised that the die had been cast and that he had no alternative except to become either a king or a fugitive. The murder of Comyn was an act of sacrilege, and he faced a future as an excommunicate and an outlaw. However his pact with Lamberton and the support of the Scottish church, who were prepared to take his side in defiance of [[Roman Catholic Church|Rome]], proved to be of great importance at this key moment when Bruce asserted his claim to the Scottish throne.<ref name=bbc/><ref name=scot/>\n\n=== Coronation ===\n[[File:Robert the Bruce and Gilies Hill.jpg|thumb|260px|Statue of Robert the Bruce at [[Bannockburn]]]]\nHe went to [[Glasgow]] and met with the Bishop of Glasgow, Robert Wishart. Rather than excommunicate Bruce, Wishart absolved him and urged people to rise in his support. They both then travelled to Scone, where they were met by Lamberton and other prominent churchmen and nobles. Less than seven weeks after the killing in Dumfries, at Scone Abbey on 25 March 1306, Robert Bruce was crowned as [[List of Scottish monarchs|King]] [[Robert the Bruce|Robert I of Scotland]].<ref name=bbc/><ref name=scot/>\n\nHe then began a new campaign to free his kingdom. After being defeated in [[Battle of Methven|battle]], he was driven from the Scottish mainland as an outlaw, with his wife, three of his brothers, his sisters, and daughter captured by English. All three of his brothers were hanged, drawn and quartered. Bruce later came out of hiding in 1307. The Scots thronged to him, and he defeated the English in a number of battles. His forces continued to grow in strength, encouraged in part by the death of Edward I in July 1307. The [[Battle of Bannockburn]] in 1314 was an especially important Scottish victory, after which English released the female relatives of Bruce for exchange.\n\nIn 1320, the [[Declaration of Arbroath]] was signed by the community of the realm of Scotland and sent to the [[Pope]] affirming Scottish independence from England. In 1327, [[Edward II of England]] was deposed and killed. The invasion of the North of England by Robert the Bruce forced [[Edward III of England]] to sign the [[Treaty of Edinburgh-Northampton]] on 1 May 1328, which recognised the independence of Scotland with Bruce as King. To further seal the peace, Robert's son and heir [[David II of Scotland|David]] married the sister of Edward III.\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Wars of Scottish Independence]]\n* [[Second War of Scottish Independence]]\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{Use dmy dates|date=August 2011}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:War Of Scottish Independence 01}}\n[[Category:Wars of Scottish Independence|.01]]\n[[Category:13th century in Scotland]]\n[[Category:13th-century military history of the Kingdom of England]]\n[[Category:14th century in Scotland]]\n[[Category:Warfare in medieval Scotland]]\n[[Category:14th-century military history of Scotland]]\n", "name_user": "77.99.131.17", "label": "unsafe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_War_of_Scottish_Independence"}
