Only a fraction of ingested drugs reach the colon, having been already exposed to small intestinal bacteria, and absorbed in the [[portal circulation]]. This small fraction is then subject to the [[drug metabolism|metabolic action]] of many communities of bacteria. Activation of the drug depends on the composition and enzymes of the bacteria and of the specifics of the drug, and therefore a great deal of individual variation can affect both the usefulness of the drug and its tolerability. It is suggested that [[parenteral administration]] of antipsychotics would bypass the gut and be more successful in overcoming TRS. The composition of gut microbiota is variable between individuals, but they are seen to remain stable. However, phyla can change in response to many factors including ageing, diet, substance-use, and medications \u2013 especially antibiotics, laxatives, and antipsychotics. In FEP, schizophrenia has been linked to significant changes in the gut microbiota that can predict response to treatment.<ref name=\"Seeman\">{{cite journal |vauthors=Seeman MV |title=The Gut Microbiome and Treatment-Resistance in Schizophrenia |journal=The Psychiatric Quarterly |volume=91 |issue=1 |pages=127\u2013136 |date=March 2020 |pmid=31781943|doi=10.1007/s11126-019-09695-4}}</ref>\n\n===Supplements===\nDisruption of the [[gut microbiota]] has been linked to inflammation, and disorders of the central nervous system.

These criteria use the self-reported experiences of the person and reported abnormalities in behavior, followed by a [[psychiatric assessment]].

The most prevalent cause put forward for TRS is that of mutation in the genes responsible for drug effectiveness. These include [[CYP3A4|liver enzyme genes]] that control the [[bioavailability|availability of a drug]] to brain targets, and genes responsible for the structure and function of these targets. In the [[large intestine|colon]] the bacteria encode a hundred times more genes than exist in the [[human genome]]. Only a fraction of ingested drugs reach the colon, having been already exposed to small intestinal bacteria, and absorbed in the [[portal circulation]]. This small fraction is then subject to the [[drug metabolism|metabolic action]] of many communities of bacteria. Activation of the drug depends on the composition and enzymes of the bacteria and of the specifics of the drug, and therefore a great deal of individual variation can affect both the usefulness of the drug and its tolerability. It is suggested that [[parenteral administration]] of antipsychotics would bypass the gut and be more successful in overcoming TRS. The composition of gut microbiota is variable between individuals, but they are seen to remain stable. However, phyla can change in response to many factors including ageing, diet, substance-use, and medications \u2013 especially antibiotics, laxatives, and antipsychotics. In FEP, schizophrenia has been linked to significant changes in the gut microbiota that can predict response to treatment.<ref name=\"Seeman\">{{cite journal |vauthors=Seeman MV |title=The Gut Microbiome and Treatment-Resistance in Schizophrenia |journal=The Psychiatric Quarterly |volume=91 |issue=1 |pages=127\u2013136 |date=March 2020 |pmid=31781943|doi=10.1007/s11126-019-09695-4}}</ref>\n\n===Supplements===\nDisruption of the [[gut microbiota]] has been linked to inflammation, and disorders of the central nervous system.

Among the actions was establishing additional places for patients in case hospitals became overwhelmed. That included transforming buildings normally used for sports and entertainment events by turning them into field hospitals.

Those actions often involve tracing contacts, implementing quarantines, and isolating infectious cases. They demand significant human resources and government staffing at all levels. As an outbreak grows, new facilities may need to be constructed to manage additional infectious cases.<ref name=NCBI>[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK525302/ \"Pandemics: Risks, Impacts, and Mitigation\"], [[National Center for Biotechnology Information]] (NCBI)</ref>\n\nNational medical organizations such as the CDC focus on both containment, to first keep the virus from spreading after its detection, and mitigation, to prevent it from spreading quickly beyond containment limits. The process of mitigating the COVID-19 pandemic attempts to extend its time frame by spreading out cases and isolating individuals, which slows the spread of the disease. By that means, it lowers the peak number of new cases, which reduces the likelihood of suddenly over-crowding doctors' offices and hospitals beyond their capacity.<ref name=cleveland>[https://www.cleveland.com/news/2020/03/mad-about-coronavirus-cancellations-heres-why-mitigating-the-curve-matters.html \"Mad about coronavirus cancellations? Here's why mitigating the curve matters\"], ''The Plain Dealer'', March 12, 2020</ref>\n\nThe risk of a truly global pandemic is limited for some diseases, such as [[Ebola]], because of the slow pace of transmission or high probability of detection and containment. COVID-19, at the other extreme, is a pathogen that has high potential to cause a severe pandemic because it easily transmits between people and remains asymptomatic for a long period, thereby lengthening the time it is infectious and not detected.<ref name=NCBI />\n\nIn general, once a pandemic has begun within a country's borders, the government must begin taking steps to curtail interactions between infected and uninfected populations. The methods used could include isolation of infected patients, quarantine, physical distancing practices, school closures, use of personal protective equipment, and [[Travel restrictions related to the 2019\u201320 coronavirus pandemic|travel restrictions]].<ref name=NCBI />\n\nThe WHO on January 30 warned that \"all countries should be prepared for containment, including active surveillance, early detection, isolation and case management, [[contact tracing]] and prevention of onward spread\" of the virus.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Kennedy |first1=Merrit |title=WHO Declares Coronavirus Outbreak A Global Health Emergency |url=https://www.npr.org/sections/goatsandsoda/2020/01/30/798894428/who-declares-coronavirus-outbreak-a-global-health-emergency |accessdate=March 30, 2020 |publisher=NPR |date=January 30, 2020}}</ref> February 25 was the first day the CDC told the American public to prepare for an outbreak.<ref>Marisa Taylor ''[https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-china-cdc-exclusiv-idUSKBN21910S Exclusive: U.S. axed CDC expert job in China months before virus outbreak]'' March 22, 2020 Reuters.com</ref>\n\nAt a White House press briefing on April 1, [[Anthony Fauci|Dr. Anthony S.

plots above are charts showing the number of COVID-19 cases, deaths, and recoveries in the U.S. since February 26, 2020. The plot below uses a [[Logarithmic scale|log scale]] for all four y axes on one plot to show relationships between the trends. On a log scale, data that shows exponential growth will plot as a more-or-less straight line. Each major division is a factor of ten. This makes the slope of the plot the relative rate of change anywhere in the timeline, which allows comparison of one plot with the others throughout the pandemic.<!--One option in the Graph:Chart template, \"yScaleType=log\" makes this happen; this option was added for this article and is not yet documented in the template.

During normal conditions, there was no discussion of estimating and building up stockpiles for use in emergencies.<ref name=\"play5\" /> The plan and guidelines were public. The estimate of resources and list of issues were not public, though they were not classified and reporters have obtained them and made them public.\n\nWhile the U.S. established the [[Strategic National Stockpile]] in 2003 as an emergency repository for antibiotics, vaccines and other critical medical supplies, it has not adequately served its role in the current pandemic.<ref name=wsj-prep /> In 2017, public health represented just 2.5% of all U.S. health spending ($274 per person).\n\nIn late February 2020, when there were only a dozen cases in the U.S., and before anyone was known to have died, the CDC advised Americans to prepare for an epidemic to contain the virus before it spreads throughout the U.S. [[Nancy Messonnier]], a director at the CDC, explained that with no vaccine or treatment available, Americans must be prepared to take other precautions.<ref>[https://www.livescience.com/coronavirus-epidemic-how-to-prepare.html \"A US coronavirus outbreak is almost inevitable.

The Editorial Board of the ''Wall Street Journal'', is among those who feel the world would have been \"better prepared\" had the WHO declared a \"Public Health Emergency\" weeks before it did, since the virus had by then spread to other countries and had already taken on the attributes of a pandemic.<ref name=wsj-info /> Brazil's Health Minister likewise felt the WHO was too slow in declaring the global coronavirus outbreak a pandemic, which it did six weeks later, thereby complicating Brazil's ability to fully prepare for and curb the spread of the virus after it arrived.<ref>[https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-03-11/who-s-pandemic-declaration-came-too-late-brazil-says \"WHO's Pandemic Declaration Came Too Late, Brazil Says\"], 'Bloomberg'', March 11, 2020</ref> By the time it was declared a pandemic on March 11, 2020, the virus had already spread across all continents except Antarctica, to 110 countries, leaving less time for some countries to fully prepare their emergency health organizations.<ref>[https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/2020/3/9/21163412/who-coronavirus-covid19-pandemic-world-health-organization \"Why the WHO waited to call the coronavirus a pandemic\"], ''Vox'', March 11, 2020</ref><ref>[https://www.nationalgeographic.com/science/2020/02/how-coronavirus-could-become-pandemic-and-why-it-matters/#close \"Coronavirus is officially a pandemic.

New York City, for instance, took preparatory steps more than a decade ago, but then discontinued them in favor of other priorities.<ref>[https://nypost.com/2020/04/07/nycs-pandemic-preparations-that-started-and-stopped/ \"NYC's pandemic preparations that started\u2014and stopped\"], ''New York Post'', April 7, 2020</ref>\n\nWith the current pandemic, once cases began spreading throughout the nation, federal and state agencies began taking urgent steps to prepare for a surge of hospital patients. Among the actions was establishing additional places for patients in case hospitals became overwhelmed. That included transforming buildings normally used for sports and entertainment events by turning them into field hospitals. The [[Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival]], for instance, was cancelled and the fairgrounds where it is normally held was turned into a medical center.<ref>[https://www.latimes.com/entertainment-arts/music/story/2020-03-30/coronavirus-event-companies-coachella-pivot-covid-19-testing \"They were supposed to build stages for Coachella.

The models can incorporate mitigation measures, seasonality, randomness, and other factors that can vary during a real epidemic. Similar tests are used by the insurance industry to understand risks posed by infrequent natural disasters such as hurricanes and earthquakes.<ref name=NCBI />\n\nThe Trump administration simulated a series of pandemic outbreaks from China in 2019 and found that the U.S. government response was \"underfunded, underprepared, and uncoordinated\" (see [[Crimson Contagion]]).<ref name= simulation2019>{{Cite web|url=https://news.yahoo.com/trump-let-u-fall-behind-120054883.html|title=How Trump let the U.S. fall behind the curve on coronavirus threat|website=news.yahoo.com}}</ref> Among the conclusions of the test was the lack of certain medical supplies to meet demand due to their needing to be imported. It led President Trump to issue an executive order to make flu vaccines more readily available and of higher quality, and he provided additional funds for the pandemic threats program in the Department of Health and Human Services ([[United States Department of Health and Human Services|HHS]]).<ref>{{Cite news|last=Sanger|first=David E.|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/19/us/politics/trump-coronavirus-outbreak.html|title=Before Virus Outbreak, a Cascade of Warnings Went Unheeded|date=March 19, 2020|work=The New York Times|access-date=March 20, 2020|last2=Lipton|first2=Eric|issn=0362-4331|last3=Sullivan|first3=Eileen|last4=Crowley|first4=Michael}}</ref> White House economists published a study in September 2019 that warned a pandemic could kill half a million Americans and devastate the economy.<ref>''[https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/31/business/coronavirus-economy-trump.html White House Economists Warned in 2019 a Pandemic Could Devastate America]'' March 31, 2020 New York Times</ref>\n\nIn 2018, the WHO also ran a simulation exercise of a global pandemic response involving more than 40 countries, although the results appear to be unavailable.<ref>[https://www.who.int/ihr/eoc-exercise/en/ \"Simulation exercise puts global pandemic readiness to the test\"], World Health Organization, December 3, 2018</ref>\n\n=== Potential response strategies ===\n\nIn 2016, the NSC laid out pandemic strategies and recommendations including, moving swiftly to fully detect potential outbreaks, securing supplemental funding, considering invoking the [[Defense Production Act of 1950|Defense Production Act]], and ensuring sufficient protective equipment available for healthcare workers.

Halyard requested funding to build a prototype, but this was not granted.\n\nA second BARDA contract was signed with Applied Research Associates of Albuquerque, to design an N95-rated mask that could be reused in emergencies without reduced effectiveness. Though federal reports had called for such a project since 2006, the ARA contract wasn't signed until 2017, and missed its 15-month completion deadline, resulting in the 2020 pandemic reaching the United States before the design was ready.<ref name=\"wp-masks\" />\n\nPrevious respiratory epidemics and government planning indicated a need for a stockpile of ventilators that were easier for less-trained medical personnel to use.

Retrieved March 23, 2020</ref>\n\n=== Containment and mitigation ===\n\n{{See also|Workplace hazard controls for COVID-19}}\n\nThe early phases of public health efforts for epidemics and pandemics are to contain or limit further outbreaks. Those actions often involve tracing contacts, implementing quarantines, and isolating infectious cases. They demand significant human resources and government staffing at all levels. As an outbreak grows, new facilities may need to be constructed to manage additional infectious cases.<ref name=NCBI>[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK525302/ \"Pandemics: Risks, Impacts, and Mitigation\"], [[National Center for Biotechnology Information]] (NCBI)</ref>\n\nNational medical organizations such as the CDC focus on both containment, to first keep the virus from spreading after its detection, and mitigation, to prevent it from spreading quickly beyond containment limits. The process of mitigating the COVID-19 pandemic attempts to extend its time frame by spreading out cases and isolating individuals, which slows the spread of the disease. By that means, it lowers the peak number of new cases, which reduces the likelihood of suddenly over-crowding doctors' offices and hospitals beyond their capacity.<ref name=cleveland>[https://www.cleveland.com/news/2020/03/mad-about-coronavirus-cancellations-heres-why-mitigating-the-curve-matters.html \"Mad about coronavirus cancellations? Here's why mitigating the curve matters\"], ''The Plain Dealer'', March 12, 2020</ref>\n\nThe risk of a truly global pandemic is limited for some diseases, such as [[Ebola]], because of the slow pace of transmission or high probability of detection and containment. COVID-19, at the other extreme, is a pathogen that has high potential to cause a severe pandemic because it easily transmits between people and remains asymptomatic for a long period, thereby lengthening the time it is infectious and not detected.<ref name=NCBI />\n\nIn general, once a pandemic has begun within a country's borders, the government must begin taking steps to curtail interactions between infected and uninfected populations. The methods used could include isolation of infected patients, quarantine, physical distancing practices, school closures, use of personal protective equipment, and [[Travel restrictions related to the 2019\u201320 coronavirus pandemic|travel restrictions]].<ref name=NCBI />\n\nThe WHO on January 30 warned that \"all countries should be prepared for containment, including active surveillance, early detection, isolation and case management, [[contact tracing]] and prevention of onward spread\" of the virus.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Kennedy |first1=Merrit |title=WHO Declares Coronavirus Outbreak A Global Health Emergency |url=https://www.npr.org/sections/goatsandsoda/2020/01/30/798894428/who-declares-coronavirus-outbreak-a-global-health-emergency |accessdate=March 30, 2020 |publisher=NPR |date=January 30, 2020}}</ref> February 25 was the first day the CDC told the American public to prepare for an outbreak.<ref>Marisa Taylor ''[https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-china-cdc-exclusiv-idUSKBN21910S Exclusive: U.S. axed CDC expert job in China months before virus outbreak]'' March 22, 2020 Reuters.com</ref>\n\nAt a White House press briefing on April 1, [[Anthony Fauci|Dr. Anthony S.

plots above are charts showing the number of COVID-19 cases, deaths, and recoveries in the U.S. since February 26, 2020. The plot below uses a [[Logarithmic scale|log scale]] for all four y axes on one plot to show relationships between the trends. On a log scale, data that shows exponential growth will plot as a more-or-less straight line. Each major division is a factor of ten. This makes the slope of the plot the relative rate of change anywhere in the timeline, which allows comparison of one plot with the others throughout the pandemic.<!--One option in the Graph:Chart template, \"yScaleType=log\" makes this happen; this option was added for this article and is not yet documented in the template.

It is named after [[Charles Borromeo McLaughlin]], the first [[Bishop]] of the [[Roman Catholic Diocese of St. Petersburg]]. An avid pilot, Bishop McLaughlin would meet the pastoral demands of a large diocese by flying from event to event in order to keep pace with his schedule. This fast-paced ministry affectionately earned him the nickname of \"Hurricane Charlie.\" Therefore, BMCHS is the home of the \"Hurricanes.\"\n\nThe school's inaugural principal was Jane Moerschbacher, who held the position until she retired in 2007. The school's current principal is Camille Jowanna, who, as a 7th grader, received the Sacrament of [[Confirmation]] from the school's namesake, Bishop McLaughlin.\n\nBishop McLaughlin Catholic High School is ranked as the 7th Best Catholic High School in the state of Florida for 2020, as rated by NICHE, with an overall grade of \"A.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.niche.com/k12/bishop-mclaughlin-catholic-high-school-spring-hill-fl/|title=2020 Best Catholic High Schools in Florida|accessdate=April 19, 2020}}</ref> BMCHS is experiencing continued growth and is known for its high academic standards, use of technology in the classroom, growing sports program and fine arts program.

Its regiments were nominally the 1st Brigade of MGEN [[Joseph J. Reynolds]] 4th Division of [[George Henry Thomas|Thomas']] [[XIV Corps (Union Army)|XIV Corps]]. Operationally, they were detached from the division and serving as a mobile mounted infantry to support any of the army's corps. Col [[John T. Wilder]] was its commander. As initially organized. the brigade had the following regiments:|<ref>Baumgartner, p. 70</ref>\n* [[92nd Illinois Volunteer Infantry Regiment|92nd Illinois Mounted Infantry]]: Col Smith D.

Miller\n* [[18th Independent Battery Indiana Light Artillery]]\n[[File:John T Wilder monument Chickamauga.jpg|thumb|Monument to Wilder and his Lightning Brigade at [[Chickamauga and Chattanooga National Military Park]]]]\n\n==Formation==\nIn response to [[John Hunt Morgan]]\u2019s October 1862 raid, the brigade was sent by Major General [[William Rosecrans|William S. Rosecrans]] in pursuit. In an effort move faster, the brigade mounted in mule wagons. The brigade nearly caught Morgan, but when they entered the last rebel bivouac, Morgan had escaped. In this effort, John T. Wilder served as the commander of the 17th Indiana, one of the component regiments in the brigade.\n\nOn 22 December, 1862 in Gallatin, Tennessee, [[John T. Wilder]] took over command of the brigade which at that time consisted of the 92nd and 98th Illinois Infantry Regiments, the 17th, 72nd, and [[75th Indiana Infantry Regiment]]s, and the 18th Indiana Battery of Light Artillery. His initial combat mission was to pursue another of Morgan\u2019s raids into Kentucky intended to sever the Army of the Cumberland's primary supply line. Lacking sufficient cavalry to screen his army as he moved south toward what would be the [[Second Battle of Murfreesboro|Battle of Stones River]] as part of the [[Stones River Campaign]], Rosecrans again had to use infantry to chase off Morgan. Trying to speed their movement, these infantry units deployed partially by rail. Wilder also unsuccessfully tried to replicate the use of mule-drawn wagons with the addition of men mounting the mules pulling the wagons<ref name=Cities>[https://www.oocities.org/wildersbrigade/history.html Wilder's Brigade Mounted Infantry Living History Society]</ref>. Unfortunately, they still traveled the majority of the pursuit on foot over unimproved, that is unpaved, roads. Despite the use of rail and wagons to speed up the pursuit, the mission was a failure with Morgan's command escaping at the Rolling Fork River.<ref>Duke, p. 71, Thomas, p. 150</ref>The difference in speed between cavalry and infantry was too much from the start.\n\nAs a result of the failure, Rosecrans and his subordinates revisited the experiment with wagons from the October events and realized the solution to their problems was the early role of dragoons as mounted infantrymen. Several times, Rosecrans wrote to the Union General-in-Chief Major General [[Henry Wager Halleck]] stating his intention to convert/establish units of mounted infantry. He also felt that he needed to outfit all of his cavalry with repeating weapons. When he felt he was not being heard, he went over Halleck directly to War Secretary Edward M Stanton. In a dispatch from 2 February, he explained his reasons to Secretary Stanton:\n{{Quote\n|text=I telegraphed the General-in-Chief that 2,000 carbines or revolving rifles were required to arm our cavalry.\nHe replied as though he thought it a complaint.\nOne rebel cavalryman takes on an average three of our infantry to watch our communications, while our progress is made slow and cautious, and we command the forage of the country only be sending large train guards.\nIt is of prime necessity, in every point of view, to master their cavalry.  I propose to do this, first, by so arming our cavalry as to give it its maximum strength.  Second, by having animals and saddles temporarily to mount infantry brigades for marches and enterprises.<ref name=Cities/>\n}}\n\nWilder, an innovative and creative man, was an eager advocate to Rosecrans for mounted infantry as a solution. On 12 February 1863, Rosecrans ordered Wilder to find mounts for his brigade. The regiments also voted on whether to convert to mounted infantry.  All but the 75th Indiana voted to change to mounted infantry. The 123rd Illinois who had wanted to become mounted infantry transferred from the 1st Brigade of the 5th Division of XIV Corps to replace them. Through February 1863, Wilder he obtained around a thousand mules to mount his command. Due to the obstinacy of the mules, horses were frequently seized from local stocks in Tennessee as contraband and replaced the mules.\n\nIn theory and in practice, the brigade would use their mounts to travel rapidly to contact, but upon engagement, the soldiers would fight dismounted. Due to this speed of deployment, the unit earned the nickname, \u201cThe Lightning Brigade,\u201d and it would prove the validity of its conversion in the campaign in the Western theater. They were also sometimes known as the \"Hatchet Brigade\" because they received long-handled [[hatchet]]s to carry instead of [[cavalry]] [[Sabre|saber]]s.\n\nAs well as mounting the command for faster deployment, Wilder felt that muzzle-loaded rifles were too difficult to use traveling on horseback. Like Rosecrans, he also believed that the superiority of repeating rifles were worth their price in return for the great increase in firepower. The repeating rifles also had the standoff range similar to the standard infantry [[Lorenz rifle|Lorenzes]], [[Springfield Model 1861|Springfields]], and [[Pattern 1853 Enfield|Enfields]] in use by the Army of the Cumberland. He felt the repeating and breech loading carbines in use by the Federal cavalry that lacked the accuracy at long range that his brigade would need. \n\nWhile Rosecrans looked at the regiment's five-shot [[Colt revolving rifle]] that would equip other units in the Army of the Cumberland (particularly seeing action with the [[21st Ohio Infantry|21st Ohio Volunteer Infantry]] Union forces at [[Snodgrass Hill]] during the [[Battle of Chickamauga]]), Wilder was initially opting for the [[Henry rifle|Henry]] repeating rifle as the proper weapon to arm his brigade. In early March, Wilder arranged a proposal for [[New Haven Arms Company]] (which later became famous as Winchester Repeating Arms) to supply his brigade with the sixteen-shot Henry if the soldiers paid for the weapons out of pocket. He had received backing from banks in Indiana on loans to be signed by each soldier and cosigned by Wilder. New Haven could come agreement with Wilder despite the financing.<ref name=Leigh>[https://opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/12/25/colonel-wilders-lightning-brigade/ \"Colonel Wilder\u2019s Lightning Brigade,\" Phil Leigh, ''New York Times'' 25 Dec 2012]</ref><ref name=Disaster>[https://www.historynet.com/battle-of-chickamauga-colonel-john-wilders-lightning-brigade-prevented-total-disaster.htm \"Battle of Chickamauga: Colonel John Wilder\u2019s Lightning Brigade Prevented Total Disaster,\" Hubert Jordan, ''America\u2019s Civil War'', Jul 1997]</ref>\n\nAfter attending a promotional demonstration by [[Christopher Spencer]] for the Army of the Cumberland of his [[Spencer repeating rifle]]<ref>[http://www.civilwar.si.edu/weapons_spencer.html A Spencer at the Smithsonian Institution]</ref>, Wilder proposed the Henry arrangement to Spencer. Spencer agreed and got the Ordnance Department to send a shipment to the Army of the Cumberland.<ref>Korn, p. 21.</ref>The majority of the shipment armed all men of the brigade.\n\nThe brigade\u2019s new weapon used a seven rimfire-cartridge tubular magazine that came through the butt. This rifle's increase in firepower would quickly make it most effective, deadly weapons in the Civil War. With new mounts and new weapons, the brigade worked out new tactics. Alongside the Army of the Cumberland's other mounted infantry units, Wilder developed new training and tactics through May and June 1863.\n\n== Tullahoma Campaign ==\n{{main|Tullahoma Campaign}}\n[[Image:Tullahoma Campaign.png|thumb|upright=1.5|Tullahoma campaign\n{{legend|#ff0000|Confederate}}\n{{legend|#0000ff|Union}}\n]]\n===Hoover's Gap===\n{{main|Battle of Hoover's Gap}}\nOn June 23, 1863, Rosecrans deployed forces to feign an attack on [[Shelbyville, Tennessee|Shelbyville]] while massing forces against Bragg's right<ref>Frisby</ref>.

Russell Butler's 1st (3rd) Kentucky Cavalry Regiment at the entrance of the gap<ref name=\"NPS\">[https://www.nps.gov/chch/planyourvisit/tullahoma-campaign-bus-tour.htm NPS Hoover's Gap]</ref>. After skirmishing briefly and withdrawing under pressure, the rebels were unable to reach the gap before the better-fed horses of the Lightning Brigade. The Kentuckians fell apart as a unit and, unluckily for the Confederates, failed in their cavalry mission to provide intelligence of the Union movement to their higher headquarters. Although Wilder's main infantry support was well behind his mounted brigade and his division commander Major General [[Joseph J. Reynolds]] had directed him to fall back to the main force after contact, he determined to continue pushing through to seize and hold the Gap before the Confederate reinforcements could prevent him. The brigade drove the 1st Kentucky through the entire seven mile length of Hoover's Gap. At the other end, they were met with artillery fire and found out that the brigade and its one battery were outnumbered four-to-one <ref name=ABT1>[https://www.battlefields.org/learn/primary-sources/battle-hoovers-gap \"The Road to Chickamauga,\" James Connolly, ''Primary Sources'', American Battlefield Trust]</ref><ref name=Lightning/>. The brigade had met Brig. Gen. [[William B. Bate]]'s brigade of Maj. Gen. [[Alexander P. Stewart]]'s division.\n\nWilder entrenched on the hills south of the gap and determined to hold this extremely advanced position.<ref name=\"Kennedy225\"/>. The Bate's brigade, supported by Brig. Gen. [[Bushrod Johnson]]'s brigade and some artillery, assaulted Wilder's position, but was driven back by the concentrated fire of the Spencers, losing 146 killed and wounded (almost a quarter of his force) to Wilder's 61. Colonel James Connolly, commander of the 123rd Illinois, wrote:\n{{Quote\n|text=As soon as the enemy opened on us with their artillery we dismounted and formed line of battle on a hill just at the south entrance to the \"Gap,\" and our battery of light artillery was opened on them, a courier was dispatched to the rear to hurry up reinforcements, our horses were sent back some distance out of the way of bursting shells, our regiment was assigned to support the battery, the other three regiments were properly disposed, and not a moment too soon, for these preparations were scarcely completed when the enemy opened on us a terrific fire of shot and shell from five different points, and their masses of infantry, with flags flying, moved out of the woods on our right in splendid style; there were three or four times our number already in sight and still others came pouring out of the woods beyond. Our regiment lay on the hill side in mud and water, the rain pouring down in torrents, while each shell screamed so close to us as to make it seem that the next would tear us to pieces.\n\nPresently the enemy got near enough to us to make a charge on our battery, and on they came; our men are on their feet in an instant and a terrible fire from the \"Spencers\" causes the advancing regiment to reel and its colors fall to the ground, but in an instant their colors are up again and on they come, thinking to reach the battery before our guns can be reloaded, but they \"reckoned without their host,\" they didn't know we had the \"Spencers,\" and their charging yell was answered by another terrible volley, and another and another without cessation, until the poor regiment was literally cut to pieces, and but few men of that 20th Tennessee that attempted the charge will ever charge again. During all the rest of the fight at \"Hoover's Gap\" they never again attempted to take that battery. After the charge they moved four regiments around to our right and attempted to get in our rear, but they were met by two of our regiments posted in the woods, and in five minutes were driven back in the greatest disorder, with a loss of 250 killed and wounded.<ref>Connolly, p. 92.</ref><ref name=ABT1/>\n}} \nAfter a long day of combat at 1900, the brigade's morale was uplifted by the arrival of a fresh battery at the gallop which meant the XIV Corps were close behind. A half hour, the Corps' the main infantry units arrived to secure the position against any further assaults. The corps commander, General Thomas, shook Wilder's hand and told him, \"You have saved the lives of a thousand men by your gallant conduct today. I didn't expect to get to this gap for three days.\"<ref>Woodworth, pp. 21\u201324; Connelly, pp. 126\u201327; Korn, pp. 24\u201326.</ref> Rosecrans also arrived on the scene.  Rather than reprimand Wilder for disobeying orders, he congratulated him for doing so, telling him it would have cost thousands of lives to take the position if he had abandoned it.<ref>Cozzens, p. 27</ref> <ref name=Lightning/>\n\nOn June 25, Bate and Johnson renewed their attempts to drive the Union men out of Hoover's Gap but failed against the Lightning Brigade now with its parent division and corps. Rosecrans brought the forward movement of the Army of the Cumberland to a halt as the roads had become quagmires. Bragg took no effective action to counter Rosecrans because his cavalry commanders were not relaying intelligence to him reliably\u2014Forrest was not informing of the weak nature of the Union right flank attack and Wheeler failed to report the movement of Crittenden's corps through Bradyville and toward Bragg's rear.<ref>Woodworth, pp. 28\u201330; Connelly, p. 127; Korn, p. 28.</ref>\n\nAs the Lighting Brigade and the 5th Division held at Hoover's Gap, Bragg soon came to realize the threat of Thomas. Meanwhile, Rosecrans shifted his forces to reinforce Thomas at the gap.<ref>Woodworth, pp. 31\u201333; Connelly, pp. 127\u201328; Korn, p. 28.</ref> Unfortunately for Bragg, infrequent direct communication with [[William J. Hardee]], his corps commander who commanded Stewart left an ignorance of Bragg's campaign strategy. That ignorance coupled with a low opinion of his commander's intellect, led Hardee to do what \"he deemed best for saving an army whose commander was an idiot.\"<ref>Woodworth, p. 33.</ref> That course was to order his battered troops under Stewart at Hoover's Gap to retreat towards Wartrace. His retreat served to only make Thomas's breakout more effective, leaving Bragg with his right flank gone. To keep his army together, he had to order Polk and Hardee to withdraw to Tullahoma on June 27.<ref>Woodworth, p. 34; Connelly, pp. 128\u201329; Lamers, pp. 280\u201382.</ref>\n\n===The Raid ===\n[[Image:John T Wilder.jpg|thumb|left|John T. Wilder]]\nThe Lightning Brigade reached Manchester at 0800 on June 27, and the remainder of the division occupied the town by noon. On June 28, the brigade left on a raid to damage the railroad infrastructure in Bragg's rear, heading south toward Decherd, a small town on the [[Nashville, Chattanooga and St. Louis Railway|Nashville & Chattanooga Railroad]]. The rain-swollen [[Elk River (Tennessee)|Elk River]] proved a significant obstacle, but they disassembled a nearby mill and constructed a raft to float their [[howitzer]]s across. They defeated a small garrison of Confederates in Decherd, tore up 300 yards of track and a burned the railroad depot filled with Confederate rations. The next morning they rode into the foothills of the Cumberland Mountains, reaching the town of [[Sewanee, Tennessee|Sewanee]] where they destroyed a branch rail line. Although pursued by a larger Confederate force, the Lightning Brigade was back in Manchester by noon, June 30. They had not lost a single man on their raid.<ref>Woodworth, pp. 36\u201338.</ref>\n\nThe effectiveness of the brigade led to an operational detachment from the division command while maintaining an administrative link to Reynold's division. Operationally, the brigade would act independently as a mobile reserve for the army.\n\nWith his corps commanders unnerved by the Lightning Brigade's raid, at 3 p.m. on June 30, Bragg issued orders for a nighttime withdrawal from fortifications in Tullahoma across the Elk River. By leaving before the Union assault, Bragg gave up an opportunity to inflict potentially serious damage on the Army of the Cumberland.<ref>Woodworth, pp. 38\u201340; Connelly, pp. 130\u201332; Lamers, pp. 284\u201385; Korn, p. 30.</ref> Initially positioned below the Elk River, Hardee and Polk felt they should retreat farther south, to the town of Cowan. In turn, their loss of nerve passed to Bragg who deemed Cowan indefensible on July 2. Without consulting his corps commanders, on July 3 Bragg ordered a retreat to Chattanooga. The army crossed the Tennessee River on July 4; a cavalry pursuit under Phil Sheridan was not successful in trapping the rear guard of Bragg's army before they crossed the river. All the Confederate units had encamped near [[Lookout Mountain]] by July 7.<ref>Woodworth, pp. 40\u201342; Connelly, p. 133; Lamers, pp. 285\u201388.</ref>\n\n== Chickamauga Campaign ==\n{{Main|Chickamauga Campaign}}\n===Second Battle of Chattanooga===\n{{Main|Second Battle of Chattanooga}} (August 21 \u2013 September 8, 1863)\n[[File:Chattanooga_II_Battlefield_Tennessee.jpg|thumb|Map of Chattanooga II Battlefield core and study areas by the [[American Battlefield Protection Program]]]]\nHaving driven Confederate forces from middle Tennessee, the Army of the Cumberland paused to refit and replenish their units. Rosecrans did not immediately pursue Bragg and \"give the finishing blow to the rebellion\" as Stanton urged. He paused to regroup and study the difficult choices of pursuit into mountainous regions. \n\nOn August 16, 1863, Rosecrans launched his campaign to take [[Chattanooga, Tennessee]]. The Lighting Brigade played a crucial role in this campaign. Rosecrans ordered the  brigade to shell Chattanooga from the western side of the Tennessee River and skirmish with the main Confederate force in the city to divert attention away from the flanking column sent southwest of the city. The Lightning Brigade marched to a location northeast of Chattanooga where the Confederates could see them, reinforcing [[General (CSA)|Gen.]] [[Braxton Bragg]]'s expectations of a Union attack on the town from that direction.<ref name=NPS2>[http://www.nps.gov/history/hps/abpp/battles/tn018.htm NPS Chickamauga]</ref> By August 21, the brigade had deployed along the [[Tennessee River]] to the east opposite Chattanooga. Wilder ordered the 18th Indiana Light Artillery ([[Captain (U.S. Army)|Capt.]] [[Colonel Eli Lilly|Eli Lilly]]'s battery) to begin shelling the town. The shells caught many soldiers and civilians in town in church observing a day of prayer and fasting. The bombardment sank two steamers docked at the landing and created a great deal of consternation amongst the Confederates.<ref name=NPS2/>\n\nContinuing periodically over the next two weeks, the shelling helped keep Bragg's attention to the northeast while the bulk of Rosecrans's army crossed the Tennessee River well west and south of Chattanooga. The diversion was successful, with Bragg concentrating his army east of Chattanooga. When Bragg learned on September 8 that the Union army was in force southwest of the city, he abandoned Chattanooga and marched his [[Army of Tennessee]] into [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]]. Bragg's army marched down the [[LaFayette Road]] and camped in the city of [[LaFayette, Georgia|LaFayette]].<ref name=NPS2/>\n\n===Skirmish at Ringgold===\n(September 11\u201312, 1863)\nAs Rosecrans moved his forces south and west, the heavily wooded and hilly terrain soon had 60 miles of separation between his three making mutual support nearly impossible. It gradually dawned on him that Bragg's Army was neither demoralized nor in disarray. It was not defeated.\nBragg attacked General [[James S. Negley]]'s isolated division of the Union [[XIV Corps (Union Army)|XIV Corps]], commanded by George H. Thomas, before Rosecrans could concentrate the rest of his army across Chickamauga Creek near Davis' Cross Roads. Negley retreated and met up with the rest of the XIV Corps. Thomas confirmed to Rosecrans that the rebels were not falling back as they had previously believed but instead seemed to be massing for an imminent attack. Concerned about mutual support, Thomas and McCook made plans to shift their corps closer together to the north.<ref>Cozzens, pp. 65\u201375.</ref>\n\nMeanwhile on 11 September, the Lightning Brigade, attached to [[Thomas Leonidas Crittenden|Crittenden's]] [[XXI Corps (Union Army)|XXI Corps]] advanced from Lee and Gordon\u2019s Mill to Ringgold, GA. There it skirmished with and defeated Col John S. Scott's brigade of [[John Pegram (general)|John Pegram's]] Division of [[Forrest's Cavalry Corps]] and then drove off Confederate reinforcements. It returned to the mill by nightfall. The following morning, it was again ordered to advance to Ringgold. Four miles short of the town, it again ran into elements of Pegram's Division. After dispersing these units, Wilder found that [[Otho F. Strahl|Strahl's Brigade]] of Cheatham's Division of Polk's Corps had cut the brigade's route back to the mill. Although the Lightning Brigade was surrounded, the rebels unsure of its identity, size, and strength, did not press home an attack.<ref name=Disaster/>\n\nAt nightfall, the Wilder deceived the Confederates by spreading campfires over a large area to make the Confederates believe his force was much larger. He formed four of his regiments and the battery into a defensive perimeter and had the fifth, the 72nd Indiana look for an escape route. After successfully locating an exit, the brigade withdrew back to XXI Corps without the loss of a man.<ref name=SunSpencer>Wilder's Lightning Brigade and Its Spencer Repeaters, Glenn W. Sunderland, Bookworks</ref>\n\n===Chickamauga===\n{{main|Battle of Chickamauga}} (September 19\u201320, 1863)\n[[File:Chickamauga Sep18.png|thumb|upright=1.5|September 18 movements on the eve of the Battle of Chickamauga]]\n\nRealizing that part of his force had narrowly escaped a Confederate trap, Rosecrans abandoned his plans for a pursuit and began to concentrate his scattered forces near Stevens Gap.<ref name=Lamers313>Lamers, p. 313.</ref> For the next four days, both armies attempted to improve their dispositions. Rosecrans continued to concentrate his forces, intending to withdraw as a single body to Chattanooga. By September 17, the three Union corps were now much less vulnerable to individual defeat. Reinforced with two divisions arriving from Virginia under Lt. Gen. [[James Longstreet]], and a division from Mississippi under Brig. Gen. [[Bushrod R. Johnson]], Bragg decided to move his army northward on the morning of 18th and advance toward Chattanooga, forcing Rosecrans's army to fight or to withdraw. If Rosecrans fought, he risked being driven back into McLemore's Cove. \n\nThe Lightning Brigade was sent to defend Alexander's Bridge over the Chickamauga on 17 September. The 92nd Illinois detached to protect the army's line if communication back to Chattanooga. The next day, 18 September, the Lightning Brigade blocked the crossing against the approach of [[William H. T. Walker|W.H.T. Walker]]'s Corps. Armed with [[Spencer repeating rifle]]s and Capt. Lilly's four guns of the 18th Indiana Battery, the brigade held off a brigade of Brig. Gen. [[St. John Richardson Liddell|St. John Liddell's]] division, which suffered 105 casualties against Wilder's superior firepower. Walker moved his men downstream a mile to Lambert's Ford, an unguarded crossing, and was able to cross around 1630, considerably behind schedule. Wilder, concerned about his left flank after Minty's loss of Reed's Bridge, withdrew the brigade to a new blocking position near the Viniard farm.<ref>Woodworth, p. 83; Cozzens, p. 198; Tucker, pp. 112\u201317; Robertson (Fall 2007), pp. 46\u201347.</ref> By dark, Bushrod Johnson's division had halted in front of Wilder's position. Walker had crossed the creek, but his troops were well scattered along the road behind Johnson. <ref>Cozzens, pp. 199\u2013200; Kennedy, p. 230; Robertson (Fall 2007), pp. 49\u201350; Eicher, p. 581; Esposito, map 112.</ref>\n\nAlthough Bragg had achieved some degree of surprise, he failed to exploit it strongly. Rosecrans, observing the dust raised by the marching Confederates in the morning, anticipated Bragg's plan. He ordered Thomas and McCook to Crittenden's support, and while the Confederates were crossing the creek, Thomas began to arrive in Crittenden's rear area.<ref>Woodworth, p. 85; Lamers, p. 322; Tucker, p. 118; Eicher, p. 581; Esposito, map 112; Robertson (Fall 2007), p. 43.</ref>\n\n[[File:Chickamauga Sep19 2.png|thumb|upright=1.5|Actions, early afternoon of September 19]]\nThrough the morning to midday of 19 September, the Lightning Brigade held its position as a reserve near Viniard farm as the battle began. As the battle progressed, the front developed in a north south direction just west of Chickamauga Creek. Viniard farm was just right of the Union Center held by Maj. Gen. [[Alexander McDowell McCook]]'s XX Corps. \n \nAt around 2 p.m, the Johnson's division (Hood's corps) forced Union Brig. Gen. [[Jefferson C. Davis]]'s two brigade division of the XX corps back across the LaFayette Road. Johnson to continue the advance with two brigades in line and one in reserve. On the right, Col. John Fulton's brigade routed King's brigade and linked up with Bate at Brotherton field. On the left, the Lighting Brigade in its reserve position repulsed Brig. Gen. John Gregg's brigade with heavy losses. Gregg was seriously wounded and his brigade advance halted. The brigade also repulsed Brig. Gen. Evander McNair's brigade, called up from the rear, when they attacked.<ref>Cozzens, pp. 196, 199\u2013200, 214; Robertson (Spring 2008), pp. 44\u201345; Woodworth, p. 92; Tucker, pp. 166, 172\u201373; Korn, p. 48; Eicher, pp. 582\u201383.</ref>\n\n[[File:Chickamauga Sep19 3.png|thumb|upright=1.5|Actions, late afternoon to dark, September 19]]\nAs the battle continued, the Union line was pushed back north to the Viniard house with elements of the XXI Corps attacked by Hood's corps on the brigade's left. These units were pushed behind the brigade's line. Hood's Corps advanced so close to Rosecrans's new headquarters at the Glenn Cabin leading to a significant risk of a Federal rout in this part of the line. At this point the Lighting Brigade's superior firepower from their Spencers eventually held back the Confederate advance, fighting from behind a drainage ditch.<ref>Robertson (Spring 2008), pp. 45\u201346; Cozzens, pp. 218\u201324, 259\u201362; Tucker, pp. 170\u201372, 174; Woodworth, p. 93; Korn, p. 48; Lamers, p. 331.</ref>\n\n[[File:Chickamauga Sep20 2.png|thumb|upright=1.5|Longstreet's Left Wing assaults, mid-day September 20]]\n\nStarting about 0930 on 20 September, the battle resumed primarily to the left (north) of the brigade. Bragg soon ordered his entire line to advance. By 1100, Longstreet had assembled a column of 10,00 men to attack the Union center. The attack succeeded aided by a gap left by a rearranged Union line. \nAs the attack rapidly turned into a Union rout in the center around 1300, the Lightning brigade was ordered to counterattack against Brig. Gen. Arthur Manigault's brigade of Hood's Division from its reserve position. It launched a strong advance with its superior firepower, driving the enemy around and through what became known as \"Bloody Pond\". Having blunted the Confederate advance, Wilder planned to capitalize on this success by attacking the flank of Hood's column. Unfortunately, the opportunity was lost when Wilder had to see to Assistant Secretary of War [[Charles Anderson Dana|Charles A. Dana]] who proclaimed that the battle was lost and demanded to be escorted to Chattanooga. In the time that Wilder took to arrange a small detachment to escort him back to safety, the opportunity for a successful attack was lost and he ordered his men to withdraw to the west.<ref>Lamers, p. 352; Robertson (Summer 2008), pp. 41\u201342; Eicher, 589; Tucker, pp. 288\u201399, 315\u201317; Cozzens, pp. 376\u201390, 392\u201396; Woodworth, pp. 118\u201319.</ref>\n\nThe brigade remained cut off on the other side of Dyer Road south of Thomas's final position on Horsesho Ridge. At 1630, Wilder received the order to retreat to Chattanooga. After darkness, the brigade mounted and retreated north.\n\nThrough the battle, the brigade had performed exceedingly well making good use of their Spencers. They were one of the few units south of Horseshoe Ridge that did not panic and retreat but successfully attacked. They departed the field intact and in good order.\n\n==Reorganization/Disestablishment==\n\nOn September 21, Rosecrans's army withdrew to the city of Chattanooga and took advantage of previous Confederate works to erect strong defensive positions. However, the supply lines into Chattanooga were at risk, and the Confederates soon occupied the surrounding heights and laid siege upon the Union forces. \n\nThe Union forces were quickly reorganized. Maj. Gen. [[Ulysses S. Grant]] was appointed commander of the newly created [[Military Division of the Mississippi]], bringing all of the territory from the [[Appalachian Mountains]] to the [[Mississippi River]] (and much of the state of [[Arkansas]]) under a single commander for the first time. On 19 October, Grant relieved the demoralized Rosecrans. He selected Thomas to command the Army of the Cumberland.\n\nIn October, the Army of the Cumberland reorganized. In this shuffle, the Lightning Brigade was gradually shifted into the cavalry of the army<ref>Starr</ref>. The 98th Illinois and the 17th Indiana were assigned to the 2nd Brigade of the 2nd Division of the Cavalry Corps. The 123rd Illinois and the 75th Indiana were transferred to the 3rd Brigade of the 2nd Division of the Cavalry Corps. The 92nd Illinois was used as an army asset with its companies serving as supply line security and command escorts.<ref name=SunSpencer/>\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==References==\n\n{{refbegin|30em}}\n\n* Baumgartner, Richard A.

Its regiments were nominally the 1st Brigade of MGEN [[Joseph J. Reynolds]] 4th Division of [[George Henry Thomas|Thomas']] [[XIV Corps (Union Army)|XIV Corps]]. Operationally, they were detached from the division and serving as a mobile mounted infantry to support any of the army's corps. Col [[John T. Wilder]] was its commander. As initially organized. the brigade had the following regiments:|<ref>Baumgartner, p. 70</ref>\n* [[92nd Illinois Volunteer Infantry Regiment|92nd Illinois Mounted Infantry]]: Col Smith D.

Miller\n* [[18th Independent Battery Indiana Light Artillery]]\n[[File:John T Wilder monument Chickamauga.jpg|thumb|Monument to Wilder and his Lightning Brigade at [[Chickamauga and Chattanooga National Military Park]]]]\n\n==Formation==\nIn response to [[John Hunt Morgan]]\u2019s October 1862 raid, the brigade was sent by Major General [[William Rosecrans|William S. Rosecrans]] in pursuit. In an effort move faster, the brigade mounted in mule wagons. The brigade nearly caught Morgan, but when they entered the last rebel bivouac, Morgan had escaped. In this effort, John T. Wilder served as the commander of the 17th Indiana, one of the component regiments in the brigade.\n\nOn 22 December, 1862 in Gallatin, Tennessee, [[John T. Wilder]] took over command of the brigade which at that time consisted of the 92nd and 98th Illinois Infantry Regiments, the 17th, 72nd, and [[75th Indiana Infantry Regiment]]s, and the 18th Indiana Battery of Light Artillery. His initial combat mission was to pursue another of Morgan\u2019s raids into Kentucky intended to sever the Army of the Cumberland's primary supply line. Lacking sufficient cavalry to screen his army as he moved south toward what would be the [[Second Battle of Murfreesboro|Battle of Stones River]] as part of the [[Stones River Campaign]], Rosecrans again had to use infantry to chase off Morgan. Trying to speed their movement, these infantry units deployed partially by rail. Wilder also unsuccessfully tried to replicate the use of mule-drawn wagons with the addition of men mounting the mules pulling the wagons<ref name=Cities>[https://www.oocities.org/wildersbrigade/history.html Wilder's Brigade Mounted Infantry Living History Society]</ref>. Unfortunately, they still traveled the majority of the pursuit on foot over unimproved, that is unpaved, roads. Despite the use of rail and wagons to speed up the pursuit, the mission was a failure with Morgan's command escaping at the Rolling Fork River.<ref>Duke, p. 71, Thomas, p. 150</ref>The difference in speed between cavalry and infantry was too much from the start.\n\nAs a result of the failure, Rosecrans and his subordinates revisited the experiment with wagons from the October events and realized the solution to their problems was the early role of dragoons as mounted infantrymen. Several times, Rosecrans wrote to the Union General-in-Chief Major General [[Henry Wager Halleck]] stating his intention to convert/establish units of mounted infantry. He also felt that he needed to outfit all of his cavalry with repeating weapons. When he felt he was not being heard, he went over Halleck directly to War Secretary Edward M Stanton. In a dispatch from 2 February, he explained his reasons to Secretary Stanton:\n{{Quote\n|text=I telegraphed the General-in-Chief that 2,000 carbines or revolving rifles were required to arm our cavalry.\nHe replied as though he thought it a complaint.\nOne rebel cavalryman takes on an average three of our infantry to watch our communications, while our progress is made slow and cautious, and we command the forage of the country only be sending large train guards.\nIt is of prime necessity, in every point of view, to master their cavalry.  I propose to do this, first, by so arming our cavalry as to give it its maximum strength.  Second, by having animals and saddles temporarily to mount infantry brigades for marches and enterprises.<ref name=Cities/>\n}}\n\nWilder, an innovative and creative man, was an eager advocate to Rosecrans for mounted infantry as a solution. On 12 February 1863, Rosecrans ordered Wilder to find mounts for his brigade. The regiments also voted on whether to convert to mounted infantry.  All but the 75th Indiana voted to change to mounted infantry. The 123rd Illinois who had wanted to become mounted infantry transferred from the 1st Brigade of the 5th Division of XIV Corps to replace them. Through February 1863, Wilder he obtained around a thousand mules to mount his command. Due to the obstinacy of the mules, horses were frequently seized from local stocks in Tennessee as contraband and replaced the mules.\n\nIn theory and in practice, the brigade would use their mounts to travel rapidly to contact, but upon engagement, the soldiers would fight dismounted. Due to this speed of deployment, the unit earned the nickname, \u201cThe Lightning Brigade,\u201d and it would prove the validity of its conversion in the campaign in the Western theater. They were also sometimes known as the \"Hatchet Brigade\" because they received long-handled [[hatchet]]s to carry instead of [[cavalry]] [[Sabre|saber]]s.\n\nAs well as mounting the command for faster deployment, Wilder felt that muzzle-loaded rifles were too difficult to use traveling on horseback. Like Rosecrans, he also believed that the superiority of repeating rifles were worth their price in return for the great increase in firepower. The repeating rifles also had the standoff range similar to the standard infantry [[Lorenz rifle|Lorenzes]], [[Springfield Model 1861|Springfields]], and [[Pattern 1853 Enfield|Enfields]] in use by the Army of the Cumberland. He felt the repeating and breech loading carbines in use by the Federal cavalry that lacked the accuracy at long range that his brigade would need. \n\nWhile Rosecrans looked at the regiment's five-shot [[Colt revolving rifle]] that would equip other units in the Army of the Cumberland (particularly seeing action with the [[21st Ohio Infantry|21st Ohio Volunteer Infantry]] Union forces at [[Snodgrass Hill]] during the [[Battle of Chickamauga]]), Wilder was initially opting for the [[Henry rifle|Henry]] repeating rifle as the proper weapon to arm his brigade. In early March, Wilder arranged a proposal for [[New Haven Arms Company]] (which later became famous as Winchester Repeating Arms) to supply his brigade with the sixteen-shot Henry if the soldiers paid for the weapons out of pocket. He had received backing from banks in Indiana on loans to be signed by each soldier and cosigned by Wilder. New Haven could come agreement with Wilder despite the financing.<ref name=Leigh>[https://opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/12/25/colonel-wilders-lightning-brigade/ \"Colonel Wilder\u2019s Lightning Brigade,\" Phil Leigh, ''New York Times'' 25 Dec 2012]</ref><ref name=Disaster>[https://www.historynet.com/battle-of-chickamauga-colonel-john-wilders-lightning-brigade-prevented-total-disaster.htm \"Battle of Chickamauga: Colonel John Wilder\u2019s Lightning Brigade Prevented Total Disaster,\" Hubert Jordan, ''America\u2019s Civil War'', Jul 1997]</ref>\n\nAfter attending a promotional demonstration by [[Christopher Spencer]] for the Army of the Cumberland of his [[Spencer repeating rifle]]<ref>[http://www.civilwar.si.edu/weapons_spencer.html A Spencer at the Smithsonian Institution]</ref>, Wilder proposed the Henry arrangement to Spencer. Spencer agreed and got the Ordnance Department to send a shipment to the Army of the Cumberland.<ref>Korn, p. 21.</ref>The majority of the shipment armed all men of the brigade.\n\nThe brigade\u2019s new weapon used a seven rimfire-cartridge tubular magazine that came through the butt. This rifle's increase in firepower would quickly make it most effective, deadly weapons in the Civil War. With new mounts and new weapons, the brigade worked out new tactics. Alongside the Army of the Cumberland's other mounted infantry units, Wilder developed new training and tactics through May and June 1863.\n\n== Tullahoma Campaign ==\n{{main|Tullahoma Campaign}}\n[[Image:Tullahoma Campaign.png|thumb|upright=1.5|Tullahoma campaign\n{{legend|#ff0000|Confederate}}\n{{legend|#0000ff|Union}}\n]]\n===Hoover's Gap===\n{{main|Battle of Hoover's Gap}}\nOn June 23, 1863, Rosecrans deployed forces to feign an attack on [[Shelbyville, Tennessee|Shelbyville]] while massing forces against Bragg's right<ref>Frisby</ref>. His troops moved out toward Liberty, Bellbuckle, and Hoover's Gaps through the [[Highland Rim]] (near [[Beechgrove, Coffee County, Tennessee|Beechgrove, Tennessee]])<ref name=Lightning>Lightning at Hoover's Gap: the Story of Wilder's Brigade, Glenn W. Sunderland, Thomas Yoseloff</ref>. On June 24 in pouring rain that would persist for 17 days (Union soldiers spread the humorous rumor during the campaign that the name Tullahoma was a combination of the Greek words \"tulla\", meaning \"mud\", and \"homa\", meaning \"more mud\".)<ref>Eicher, p. 496; Korn, p. 29.</ref>, Maj. Gen. [[George Henry Thomas|George H. Thomas's]] men, spearheaded by Colonel [[John T. Wilder]]'s \"Lightning Brigade\", made for [[Battle of Hoover's Gap|Hoover's Gap]]. The brigade showed the advantage of their speed despite the weather by reaching the gap nearly 9 miles ahead of Thomas's main body.<ref name=\"Kennedy225\">Kennedy, p. 225.</ref> Despite orders from the divisional commander, General [[Joseph J. Reynolds]] to fall back to his infantry, which was still six miles away, Wilder decided to take and hold the position. \n\nThe command surprised Confederate Colonel J. Russell Butler's 1st (3rd) Kentucky Cavalry Regiment at the entrance of the gap<ref name=\"NPS\">[https://www.nps.gov/chch/planyourvisit/tullahoma-campaign-bus-tour.htm NPS Hoover's Gap]</ref>. After skirmishing briefly and withdrawing under pressure, the rebels were unable to reach the gap before the better-fed horses of the Lightning Brigade. The Kentuckians fell apart as a unit and, unluckily for the Confederates, failed in their cavalry mission to provide intelligence of the Union movement to their higher headquarters. Although Wilder's main infantry support was well behind his mounted brigade and his division commander Major General [[Joseph J. Reynolds]] had directed him to fall back to the main force after contact, he determined to continue pushing through to seize and hold the Gap before the Confederate reinforcements could prevent him. The brigade drove the 1st Kentucky through the entire seven mile length of Hoover's Gap. At the other end, they were met with artillery fire and found out that the brigade and its one battery were outnumbered four-to-one <ref name=ABT1>[https://www.battlefields.org/learn/primary-sources/battle-hoovers-gap \"The Road to Chickamauga,\" James Connolly, ''Primary Sources'', American Battlefield Trust]</ref><ref name=Lightning/>. The brigade had met Brig. Gen. [[William B. Bate]]'s brigade of Maj. Gen. [[Alexander P. Stewart]]'s division.\n\nWilder entrenched on the hills south of the gap and determined to hold this extremely advanced position.<ref name=\"Kennedy225\"/>. The Bate's brigade, supported by Brig. Gen. [[Bushrod Johnson]]'s brigade and some artillery, assaulted Wilder's position, but was driven back by the concentrated fire of the Spencers, losing 146 killed and wounded (almost a quarter of his force) to Wilder's 61. Colonel James Connolly, commander of the 123rd Illinois, wrote:\n{{Quote\n|text=As soon as the enemy opened on us with their artillery we dismounted and formed line of battle on a hill just at the south entrance to the \"Gap,\" and our battery of light artillery was opened on them, a courier was dispatched to the rear to hurry up reinforcements, our horses were sent back some distance out of the way of bursting shells, our regiment was assigned to support the battery, the other three regiments were properly disposed, and not a moment too soon, for these preparations were scarcely completed when the enemy opened on us a terrific fire of shot and shell from five different points, and their masses of infantry, with flags flying, moved out of the woods on our right in splendid style; there were three or four times our number already in sight and still others came pouring out of the woods beyond. Our regiment lay on the hill side in mud and water, the rain pouring down in torrents, while each shell screamed so close to us as to make it seem that the next would tear us to pieces.\n\nPresently the enemy got near enough to us to make a charge on our battery, and on they came; our men are on their feet in an instant and a terrible fire from the \"Spencers\" causes the advancing regiment to reel and its colors fall to the ground, but in an instant their colors are up again and on they come, thinking to reach the battery before our guns can be reloaded, but they \"reckoned without their host,\" they didn't know we had the \"Spencers,\" and their charging yell was answered by another terrible volley, and another and another without cessation, until the poor regiment was literally cut to pieces, and but few men of that 20th Tennessee that attempted the charge will ever charge again. During all the rest of the fight at \"Hoover's Gap\" they never again attempted to take that battery. After the charge they moved four regiments around to our right and attempted to get in our rear, but they were met by two of our regiments posted in the woods, and in five minutes were driven back in the greatest disorder, with a loss of 250 killed and wounded.<ref>Connolly, p. 92.</ref><ref name=ABT1/>\n}} \nAfter a long day of combat at 1900, the brigade's morale was uplifted by the arrival of a fresh battery at the gallop which meant the XIV Corps were close behind. A half hour, the Corps' the main infantry units arrived to secure the position against any further assaults. The corps commander, General Thomas, shook Wilder's hand and told him, \"You have saved the lives of a thousand men by your gallant conduct today. I didn't expect to get to this gap for three days.\"<ref>Woodworth, pp. 21\u201324; Connelly, pp. 126\u201327; Korn, pp. 24\u201326.</ref> Rosecrans also arrived on the scene.  Rather than reprimand Wilder for disobeying orders, he congratulated him for doing so, telling him it would have cost thousands of lives to take the position if he had abandoned it.<ref>Cozzens, p. 27</ref> <ref name=Lightning/>\n\nOn June 25, Bate and Johnson renewed their attempts to drive the Union men out of Hoover's Gap but failed against the Lightning Brigade now with its parent division and corps. Rosecrans brought the forward movement of the Army of the Cumberland to a halt as the roads had become quagmires. Bragg took no effective action to counter Rosecrans because his cavalry commanders were not relaying intelligence to him reliably\u2014Forrest was not informing of the weak nature of the Union right flank attack and Wheeler failed to report the movement of Crittenden's corps through Bradyville and toward Bragg's rear.<ref>Woodworth, pp. 28\u201330; Connelly, p. 127; Korn, p. 28.</ref>\n\nAs the Lighting Brigade and the 5th Division held at Hoover's Gap, Bragg soon came to realize the threat of Thomas. Meanwhile, Rosecrans shifted his forces to reinforce Thomas at the gap.<ref>Woodworth, pp. 31\u201333; Connelly, pp. 127\u201328; Korn, p. 28.</ref> Unfortunately for Bragg, infrequent direct communication with [[William J. Hardee]], his corps commander who commanded Stewart left an ignorance of Bragg's campaign strategy. That ignorance coupled with a low opinion of his commander's intellect, led Hardee to do what \"he deemed best for saving an army whose commander was an idiot.\"<ref>Woodworth, p. 33.</ref> That course was to order his battered troops under Stewart at Hoover's Gap to retreat towards Wartrace. His retreat served to only make Thomas's breakout more effective, leaving Bragg with his right flank gone. To keep his army together, he had to order Polk and Hardee to withdraw to Tullahoma on June 27.<ref>Woodworth, p. 34; Connelly, pp. 128\u201329; Lamers, pp. 280\u201382.</ref>\n\n===The Raid ===\n[[Image:John T Wilder.jpg|thumb|left|John T. Wilder]]\nThe Lightning Brigade reached Manchester at 0800 on June 27, and the remainder of the division occupied the town by noon. On June 28, the brigade left on a raid to damage the railroad infrastructure in Bragg's rear, heading south toward Decherd, a small town on the [[Nashville, Chattanooga and St. Louis Railway|Nashville & Chattanooga Railroad]]. The rain-swollen [[Elk River (Tennessee)|Elk River]] proved a significant obstacle, but they disassembled a nearby mill and constructed a raft to float their [[howitzer]]s across. They defeated a small garrison of Confederates in Decherd, tore up 300 yards of track and a burned the railroad depot filled with Confederate rations. The next morning they rode into the foothills of the Cumberland Mountains, reaching the town of [[Sewanee, Tennessee|Sewanee]] where they destroyed a branch rail line. Although pursued by a larger Confederate force, the Lightning Brigade was back in Manchester by noon, June 30. They had not lost a single man on their raid.<ref>Woodworth, pp. 36\u201338.</ref>\n\nThe effectiveness of the brigade led to an operational detachment from the division command while maintaining an administrative link to Reynold's division. Operationally, the brigade would act independently as a mobile reserve for the army.\n\nWith his corps commanders unnerved by the Lightning Brigade's raid, at 3 p.m. on June 30, Bragg issued orders for a nighttime withdrawal from fortifications in Tullahoma across the Elk River. By leaving before the Union assault, Bragg gave up an opportunity to inflict potentially serious damage on the Army of the Cumberland.<ref>Woodworth, pp. 38\u201340; Connelly, pp. 130\u201332; Lamers, pp. 284\u201385; Korn, p. 30.</ref> Initially positioned below the Elk River, Hardee and Polk felt they should retreat farther south, to the town of Cowan. In turn, their loss of nerve passed to Bragg who deemed Cowan indefensible on July 2. Without consulting his corps commanders, on July 3 Bragg ordered a retreat to Chattanooga. The army crossed the Tennessee River on July 4; a cavalry pursuit under Phil Sheridan was not successful in trapping the rear guard of Bragg's army before they crossed the river. All the Confederate units had encamped near [[Lookout Mountain]] by July 7.<ref>Woodworth, pp. 40\u201342; Connelly, p. 133; Lamers, pp. 285\u201388.</ref>\n\n== Chickamauga Campaign ==\n{{Main|Chickamauga Campaign}}\n===Second Battle of Chattanooga===\n{{Main|Second Battle of Chattanooga}} (August 21 \u2013 September 8, 1863)\n[[File:Chattanooga_II_Battlefield_Tennessee.jpg|thumb|Map of Chattanooga II Battlefield core and study areas by the [[American Battlefield Protection Program]]]]\nHaving driven Confederate forces from middle Tennessee, the Army of the Cumberland paused to refit and replenish their units. Rosecrans did not immediately pursue Bragg and \"give the finishing blow to the rebellion\" as Stanton urged. He paused to regroup and study the difficult choices of pursuit into mountainous regions. \n\nOn August 16, 1863, Rosecrans launched his campaign to take [[Chattanooga, Tennessee]]. The Lighting Brigade played a crucial role in this campaign. Rosecrans ordered the  brigade to shell Chattanooga from the western side of the Tennessee River and skirmish with the main Confederate force in the city to divert attention away from the flanking column sent southwest of the city. The Lightning Brigade marched to a location northeast of Chattanooga where the Confederates could see them, reinforcing [[General (CSA)|Gen.]] [[Braxton Bragg]]'s expectations of a Union attack on the town from that direction.<ref name=NPS2>[http://www.nps.gov/history/hps/abpp/battles/tn018.htm NPS Chickamauga]</ref> By August 21, the brigade had deployed along the [[Tennessee River]] to the east opposite Chattanooga. Wilder ordered the 18th Indiana Light Artillery ([[Captain (U.S. Army)|Capt.]] [[Colonel Eli Lilly|Eli Lilly]]'s battery) to begin shelling the town. The shells caught many soldiers and civilians in town in church observing a day of prayer and fasting. The bombardment sank two steamers docked at the landing and created a great deal of consternation amongst the Confederates.<ref name=NPS2/>\n\nContinuing periodically over the next two weeks, the shelling helped keep Bragg's attention to the northeast while the bulk of Rosecrans's army crossed the Tennessee River well west and south of Chattanooga. The diversion was successful, with Bragg concentrating his army east of Chattanooga. When Bragg learned on September 8 that the Union army was in force southwest of the city, he abandoned Chattanooga and marched his [[Army of Tennessee]] into [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]]. Bragg's army marched down the [[LaFayette Road]] and camped in the city of [[LaFayette, Georgia|LaFayette]].<ref name=NPS2/>\n\n===Skirmish at Ringgold===\n(September 11\u201312, 1863)\nAs Rosecrans moved his forces south and west, the heavily wooded and hilly terrain soon had 60 miles of separation between his three making mutual support nearly impossible. It gradually dawned on him that Bragg's Army was neither demoralized nor in disarray. It was not defeated.\nBragg attacked General [[James S. Negley]]'s isolated division of the Union [[XIV Corps (Union Army)|XIV Corps]], commanded by George H. Thomas, before Rosecrans could concentrate the rest of his army across Chickamauga Creek near Davis' Cross Roads. Negley retreated and met up with the rest of the XIV Corps. Thomas confirmed to Rosecrans that the rebels were not falling back as they had previously believed but instead seemed to be massing for an imminent attack. Concerned about mutual support, Thomas and McCook made plans to shift their corps closer together to the north.<ref>Cozzens, pp. 65\u201375.</ref>\n\nMeanwhile on 11 September, the Lightning Brigade, attached to [[Thomas Leonidas Crittenden|Crittenden's]] [[XXI Corps (Union Army)|XXI Corps]] advanced from Lee and Gordon\u2019s Mill to Ringgold, GA. There it skirmished with and defeated Col John S. Scott's brigade of [[John Pegram (general)|John Pegram's]] Division of [[Forrest's Cavalry Corps]] and then drove off Confederate reinforcements. It returned to the mill by nightfall. The following morning, it was again ordered to advance to Ringgold. Four miles short of the town, it again ran into elements of Pegram's Division. After dispersing these units, Wilder found that [[Otho F. Strahl|Strahl's Brigade]] of Cheatham's Division of Polk's Corps had cut the brigade's route back to the mill. Although the Lightning Brigade was surrounded, the rebels unsure of its identity, size, and strength, did not press home an attack.<ref name=Disaster/>\n\nAt nightfall, the Wilder deceived the Confederates by spreading campfires over a large area to make the Confederates believe his force was much larger. He formed four of his regiments and the battery into a defensive perimeter and had the fifth, the 72nd Indiana look for an escape route. After successfully locating an exit, the brigade withdrew back to XXI Corps without the loss of a man.<ref name=SunSpencer>Wilder's Lightning Brigade and Its Spencer Repeaters, Glenn W. Sunderland, Bookworks</ref>\n\n===Chickamauga===\n{{main|Battle of Chickamauga}} (September 19\u201320, 1863)\n[[File:Chickamauga Sep18.png|thumb|upright=1.5|September 18 movements on the eve of the Battle of Chickamauga]]\n\nRealizing that part of his force had narrowly escaped a Confederate trap, Rosecrans abandoned his plans for a pursuit and began to concentrate his scattered forces near Stevens Gap.<ref name=Lamers313>Lamers, p. 313.</ref> For the next four days, both armies attempted to improve their dispositions. Rosecrans continued to concentrate his forces, intending to withdraw as a single body to Chattanooga. By September 17, the three Union corps were now much less vulnerable to individual defeat. Reinforced with two divisions arriving from Virginia under Lt. Gen. [[James Longstreet]], and a division from Mississippi under Brig. Gen. [[Bushrod R. Johnson]], Bragg decided to move his army northward on the morning of 18th and advance toward Chattanooga, forcing Rosecrans's army to fight or to withdraw. If Rosecrans fought, he risked being driven back into McLemore's Cove. \n\nThe Lightning Brigade was sent to defend Alexander's Bridge over the Chickamauga on 17 September. The 92nd Illinois detached to protect the army's line if communication back to Chattanooga. The next day, 18 September, the Lightning Brigade blocked the crossing against the approach of [[William H. T. Walker|W.H.T. Walker]]'s Corps. Armed with [[Spencer repeating rifle]]s and Capt. Lilly's four guns of the 18th Indiana Battery, the brigade held off a brigade of Brig. Gen. [[St. John Richardson Liddell|St. John Liddell's]] division, which suffered 105 casualties against Wilder's superior firepower. Walker moved his men downstream a mile to Lambert's Ford, an unguarded crossing, and was able to cross around 1630, considerably behind schedule. Wilder, concerned about his left flank after Minty's loss of Reed's Bridge, withdrew the brigade to a new blocking position near the Viniard farm.<ref>Woodworth, p. 83; Cozzens, p. 198; Tucker, pp. 112\u201317; Robertson (Fall 2007), pp. 46\u201347.</ref> By dark, Bushrod Johnson's division had halted in front of Wilder's position. Walker had crossed the creek, but his troops were well scattered along the road behind Johnson. <ref>Cozzens, pp. 199\u2013200; Kennedy, p. 230; Robertson (Fall 2007), pp. 49\u201350; Eicher, p. 581; Esposito, map 112.</ref>\n\nAlthough Bragg had achieved some degree of surprise, he failed to exploit it strongly. Rosecrans, observing the dust raised by the marching Confederates in the morning, anticipated Bragg's plan. He ordered Thomas and McCook to Crittenden's support, and while the Confederates were crossing the creek, Thomas began to arrive in Crittenden's rear area.<ref>Woodworth, p. 85; Lamers, p. 322; Tucker, p. 118; Eicher, p. 581; Esposito, map 112; Robertson (Fall 2007), p. 43.</ref>\n\n[[File:Chickamauga Sep19 2.png|thumb|upright=1.5|Actions, early afternoon of September 19]]\nThrough the morning to midday of 19 September, the Lightning Brigade held its position as a reserve near Viniard farm as the battle began. As the battle progressed, the front developed in a north south direction just west of Chickamauga Creek. Viniard farm was just right of the Union Center held by Maj. Gen. [[Alexander McDowell McCook]]'s XX Corps. \n \nAt around 2 p.m, the Johnson's division (Hood's corps) forced Union Brig. Gen. [[Jefferson C. Davis]]'s two brigade division of the XX corps back across the LaFayette Road. Johnson to continue the advance with two brigades in line and one in reserve. On the right, Col. John Fulton's brigade routed King's brigade and linked up with Bate at Brotherton field. On the left, the Lighting Brigade in its reserve position repulsed Brig. Gen. John Gregg's brigade with heavy losses. Gregg was seriously wounded and his brigade advance halted. The brigade also repulsed Brig. Gen. Evander McNair's brigade, called up from the rear, when they attacked.<ref>Cozzens, pp. 196, 199\u2013200, 214; Robertson (Spring 2008), pp. 44\u201345; Woodworth, p. 92; Tucker, pp. 166, 172\u201373; Korn, p. 48; Eicher, pp. 582\u201383.</ref>\n\n[[File:Chickamauga Sep19 3.png|thumb|upright=1.5|Actions, late afternoon to dark, September 19]]\nAs the battle continued, the Union line was pushed back north to the Viniard house with elements of the XXI Corps attacked by Hood's corps on the brigade's left. These units were pushed behind the brigade's line. Hood's Corps advanced so close to Rosecrans's new headquarters at the Glenn Cabin leading to a significant risk of a Federal rout in this part of the line. At this point the Lighting Brigade's superior firepower from their Spencers eventually held back the Confederate advance, fighting from behind a drainage ditch.<ref>Robertson (Spring 2008), pp. 45\u201346; Cozzens, pp. 218\u201324, 259\u201362; Tucker, pp. 170\u201372, 174; Woodworth, p. 93; Korn, p. 48; Lamers, p. 331.</ref>\n\n[[File:Chickamauga Sep20 2.png|thumb|upright=1.5|Longstreet's Left Wing assaults, mid-day September 20]]\n\nStarting about 0930 on 20 September, the battle resumed primarily to the left (north) of the brigade. Bragg soon ordered his entire line to advance. By 1100, Longstreet had assembled a column of 10,00 men to attack the Union center. The attack succeeded aided by a gap left by a rearranged Union line. \nAs the attack rapidly turned into a Union rout in the center around 1300, the Lightning brigade was ordered to counterattack against Brig. Gen. Arthur Manigault's brigade of Hood's Division from its reserve position. It launched a strong advance with its superior firepower, driving the enemy around and through what became known as \"Bloody Pond\". Having blunted the Confederate advance, Wilder planned to capitalize on this success by attacking the flank of Hood's column. Unfortunately, the opportunity was lost when Wilder had to see to Assistant Secretary of War [[Charles Anderson Dana|Charles A. Dana]] who proclaimed that the battle was lost and demanded to be escorted to Chattanooga. In the time that Wilder took to arrange a small detachment to escort him back to safety, the opportunity for a successful attack was lost and he ordered his men to withdraw to the west.<ref>Lamers, p. 352; Robertson (Summer 2008), pp. 41\u201342; Eicher, 589; Tucker, pp. 288\u201399, 315\u201317; Cozzens, pp. 376\u201390, 392\u201396; Woodworth, pp. 118\u201319.</ref>\n\nThe brigade remained cut off on the other side of Dyer Road south of Thomas's final position on Horsesho Ridge. At 1630, Wilder received the order to retreat to Chattanooga. After darkness, the brigade mounted and retreated north.\n\nThrough the battle, the brigade had performed exceedingly well making good use of their Spencers. They were one of the few units south of Horseshoe Ridge that did not panic and retreat but successfully attacked. They departed the field intact and in good order.\n\n==Reorganization/Disestablishment==\n\nOn September 21, Rosecrans's army withdrew to the city of Chattanooga and took advantage of previous Confederate works to erect strong defensive positions. However, the supply lines into Chattanooga were at risk, and the Confederates soon occupied the surrounding heights and laid siege upon the Union forces. \n\nThe Union forces were quickly reorganized. Maj. Gen. [[Ulysses S. Grant]] was appointed commander of the newly created [[Military Division of the Mississippi]], bringing all of the territory from the [[Appalachian Mountains]] to the [[Mississippi River]] (and much of the state of [[Arkansas]]) under a single commander for the first time. On 19 October, Grant relieved the demoralized Rosecrans. He selected Thomas to command the Army of the Cumberland.\n\nIn October, the Army of the Cumberland reorganized. In this shuffle, the Lightning Brigade was gradually shifted into the cavalry of the army<ref>Starr</ref>. The 98th Illinois and the 17th Indiana were assigned to the 2nd Brigade of the 2nd Division of the Cavalry Corps. The 123rd Illinois and the 75th Indiana were transferred to the 3rd Brigade of the 2nd Division of the Cavalry Corps. The 92nd Illinois was used as an army asset with its companies serving as supply line security and command escorts.<ref name=SunSpencer/>\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==References==\n* Baumgartner, Richard A.
