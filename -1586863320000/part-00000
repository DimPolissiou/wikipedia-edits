Although it was originally intended to be a regiment consisting of troops from the [[Mahar]] community of [[Maharashtra]], however nowadays the Mahar regiment is composed of dalit communities from mainly states like Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh, Bihar and Uttar Pradesh.\n\n==History==\n\n\n\n===The Martial Races theory and disbandment===\n{{Unreferenced section|date=November 2016}}\n\nAfter the Revolt of 1857, the [[United Kingdom|British]] officers of the Indian Army, particularly those who had served in the [[First Anglo-Afghan War|First]] and [[Second Anglo-Afghan War|Second Afghan Wars]], began to give currency to the [[Martial Race]]s Theory. This theory was that some races and communities among Indians were naturally warlike, and more suited to warfare than others. A major proponent of this theory was [[Frederick Sleigh Roberts, 1st Earl Roberts|Lord Roberts]], who became [[Commander-in-Chief, India|Commander-in-Chief of the Indian Army]] in the November 1885. There was a gradual \"Punjabisation\" of the Indian Army to the detriment of the other communities. The final blow for the Mahar [[troops]] came in 1892, when it was decided to institute \"class regiments\" in the Indian Army. The Mahars were not included in these class regiments, and it was notified that the Mahars, among with some other classes, were no longer to be recruited in the Indian army. The Mahar troops, who included 104 [[Viceroy's Commissioned Officer]]s and a host of [[Non-commissioned officers]] and Sepoys were demobilised. This event was regarded by the Mahars as a betrayal of their loyalty by a [[government]] they had served for over a hundred years.\n\n===1892-1941===\n{{Unreferenced section|date=November 2016}}\n\nAfter the demobilisation of the Mahar troops, there were many attempts by the leaders of the Mahar community to persuade the Government to let them serve in the Army once again. Petitions to this effect were drafted by ex-soldiers such as [[Gopal Baba Walangkar]] in 1894, and Shivram Janba Kamble in 1904. These petitions were supported in principle by the politician and social reformer [[Gopal Krishna Gokhale]], who was opposed to the Martial Races theory. They were also supported by the [[Indian National Congress]], who were also opposed to the recruiting policies of the Army.\n\nThe recruitment policies of the British Indian Army continued until the beginning of the [[First World War]] in 1914. The War forced the Government to begin more broad-based recruiting, and the Mahars were at last allowed to enlist in the Army. One battalion of Mahar troops, the [[111th Mahars]] was raised in the June 1917. However, the battalion did not see much service during the War, and in 1920 it was merged with the [[71st Punjabis]]. Finally, the battalion was disbanded in March 1921, and the Mahars were once again demobilised.\n\nThe period between the wars saw increased efforts by the Mahars to persuade the government to let them enlist in the Army. One proponent of Mahar recruitment was Dr. [[B. R. Ambedkar]], whose father, [[Subedar Major|Sub. Maj.]] [[Ambedkar family|Ramji Maloji Sakpal]] had been a soldier in the British Indian Army. However, the proposed reorganisation of the Indian Army that was to occur in the 1930s was postponed because of a lack of funds in the [[Great Depression]]. In 1939, the [[Second World War]] broke out, and once again, the Army was forced to overlook its narrow minded recruitment policies in the face of harsh necessity.\n\n===Raising of the Mahar Regiment===\n{{Unreferenced section|date=November 2016}}\n\nIn the July 1941, B. R. Ambedkar was appointed to the Defence Advisory Committee of the Viceroy's Executive Council. He used this appointment to exert pressure within the military establishment for a Mahar regiment. He also appealed to the Mahars to join the Army in large numbers. In October, the Army gave in, and the 1st battalion of the Mahar Regiment was raised in [[Belgaum]] under Lt. Col. H.J.R. Jackson of the [[13th Frontier Force Rifles]] and Sub. Maj. Sheikh Hassnuddin. The 2nd battalion was raised in [[Kamptee]] in June 1942 under Lt. Col. J.W.K. Kirwan and Sub. Maj. Bholaji Ranjane. A cap badge was designed for the regiment by Capt. E.E.L. Mortlemans, an officer of the 2nd battalion. The badge featured the [[Battle of Koregaon|Koregaon Pillar]] over the word \"Mahar\". The third battalion, the 25th Mahars, was raised in [[Belgaum]] in the August 1942 by Lt. Col V. Chambier and Sub. Maj. Sardar Bahadur Ladkojirao Bhonsale, and the 3rd Mahars were raised in [[Nowshera, Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa|Nowshera]] by Lt. Col. R.N.D. Frier and Sub. Maj. Bholaji Ranjane. During the [[Second World War]], the 1st and 3rd Mahars served in the [[North-West Frontier Province (1901\u20131955)|North-West Frontier Province]], while the 2nd and 25th were employed on internal security duties within the country. The 2nd battalion also saw service in the [[Burma Campaign]] as a part of the [[23rd Indian Division]], where they suffered 5 casualties and had one officer [[mentioned in dispatches]]. They also served in [[Iraq]] after the war as a part of PAIFORCE. In 1946, the 25th Mahars were disbanded, along with many other garrison battalions of the Indian Army. Its officers and men were largely absorbed by the other three battalions of the regiment. In the October 1946, the regiment was converted into a [[machine gun]] regiment, and the regimental centre was established at Kamptee. Following the conversion, the cap badge was changed. The new badge had two crossed [[Vickers machine gun]]s over the Koregaon Pillar, over a scroll that said \"The Mahar MG Regiment\". The three surviving battalions of the regiment served as a part of the [[Punjab Boundary Force]], and took part in escorting refugees during the [[Partition of India]].\n\n===The Border Scouts===\n{{Unreferenced section|date=November 2016}}\n\nThe Border Scouts were an irregular force formed by the people of the border villages in [[East Punjab]] during Partition. Hailing as they did from the erstwhile greater state of East Punjab (which included the present states of [[Haryana]] and [[Himachal Pradesh]]), the force had people hailing from a greater mix of ethnic, religious and caste backgrounds than was the norm in the Indian Army. They did some useful work defending villages from attacks during partition, and as a reward, were given a more permanent character as the East Punjab Frontier Scouts in 1948. They served along the border with Pakistan as border guards, and were regarded as a useful adjunct of the Punjab Armed Police. The unit was redesignated the 1st, 2nd and 3rd Battalions of the Border Scouts in 1951, with recruitment from different North Indian communities. In 1956, the decision to convert this force into Machine-Gun Regiments was taken, and the three battalions were merged with the Mahar Regiment, the only Indian Machine Gun Regiment in existence at the time. They joined the Regiment as the 4th, 5th and 6th Battalions of the Mahar Regiment, and it is to these units that the Regiment traces its mixed-class composition. The three Battalions style themselves battalions of the Mahar Regiment (Borders) even today.\n\n==Composition and Recruitment==\nThe class composition of the Regiment also changed. While 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 7th, 8th and 13th battalions were all pure Mahar battalions, the others were mixed classes right down to the smallest sub-unit level. The conversion training started in November 1963 with 1st Mahar and completed in May 1964 with 10th Mahar. The year 1965 saw all the battalions of the regiment gearing up for operations. These included the newly raised 11th and 12th battalions that had the unique composition of Bengalis, Oriyas and Gujratis - the communities that had been stamped as non-martial by the British. Their entry into the Mahar fraternity added strength to national integration-the distinctive feature which the regiment has always been proud of.<ref>[http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/india/rgt-mahar.htm Mahar Regiment<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>\n\nBattalions\n*1st [[Battalion]]\n*2nd [[Battalion]]\n*3rd [[Battalion]]\n*4th [[Battalion]] ([[Borders]])\n*5th [[Battalion]] (Borders)\n*6th [[Battalion]] (Borders)\n*7th [[Battalion]]\n*8th [[Battalion]] ([[Param Vir Chakra]])\n*9th [[Battalion]]\n*10th [[Battalion]]\n*11th [[Battalion]]\n*12th [[Battalion]]\n*13th [[Battalion]]\n*14th [[Battalion]] (formerly 31st Mahar)&(UN [[Military operation|Mission]] 2017 to 2018)\n*15th [[Battalion]] (formerly 32nd Mahar)\n*17th [[Battalion]]\n*18th [[Battalion]]\n*19th [[Battalion]]\n*20th [[Battalion]]  \n*21st [[Battalion]]\n*22nd [[Battalion]]\n <ref name=autogenerated1 />\n\n===Former Battalions===\n*25th Battalion (disbanded 1946).\n*16th Battalion (formerly 8th Parachute Regiment) (converted to 12th Mechanised Infantry in 1981)\n\n===Allied Units===\n*108th Infantry Battalion Territorial Army (based at Dehradun, Uttarakhand)\n*115th Infantry Battalion Territorial Army (based at Belgaum, Karnataka)\n*136th Infantry Battalion Territorial Army (Ecological) (based at Aurangabad, Maharashtra)\n*1st Battalion [[Rashtriya Rifles]]\n*30th Battalion Rashtriya Rifles\n*51st Battalion Rashtriya Rifles\n\n==References==\n*{{note|MarRace}} [http://www.country-data.com/cgi-bin/query/r-6146.html The Martial Races at Country-Data.com]\n{{Reflist}}\n{{Indian Army Infantry Regiments}}\n[http://www.bharat-rakshak.com/ARMY/units/114-Mahar-Regt.]\n{{https://youtu.be/cmXjoLPc0lg}}\n\n[[Category:Infantry regiments of the Indian Army from 1947]]\n[[Category:British Indian Army infantry regiments]]\n[[Category:Units of the Indian Peace Keeping Force]]\n", "text_old": "{{short description|Indian Army infantry regiment}}\n{{Infobox military unit\n|unit_name=Mahar Regiment\n|image=Mahar Regimental Insignia.gif\n|caption=Mahar Regiment Insignia\n|dates= 1815&ndash;present\n|country={{flagicon|India}} [[India]]\n|branch=[[Indian Army]]\n|type=Line Infantry\n|role=[[Infantry]]\n|size=21 battalions\n|regimental centre= [[Saugar, Madhya Pradesh]]\n|colors= Bolo Hindustan Ki Jai (Say Victory to India)\n|colors_label=War Cry \n|http://www.bharat-rakshak.com/ARMY/units/114-Mahar-Regt.html\n!-- Commanders -->\n|Current COR= [[Major General Sudhakar G VSM]] \n|current_commander_label=\n|ceremonial_chief=\n|ceremonial_chief_label=\n|colonel_of_the_regiment=\n|colonel_of_the_regiment_label=\n|notable_commanders=[[General]] [[K.

Although it was originally intended to be a regiment consisting of troops from the [[Mahar]] community of [[Maharashtra]], the Mahar Regiment is one of the only regiments in the Indian Army that is composed of troops from all communities and regions of India.\n\n==History==\n\n\n\n===The Martial Races theory and disbandment===\n{{Unreferenced section|date=November 2016}}\n\nAfter the Revolt of 1857, the [[United Kingdom|British]] officers of the Indian Army, particularly those who had served in the [[First Anglo-Afghan War|First]] and [[Second Anglo-Afghan War|Second Afghan Wars]], began to give currency to the [[Martial Race]]s Theory. This theory was that some races and communities among Indians were naturally warlike, and more suited to warfare than others. A major proponent of this theory was [[Frederick Sleigh Roberts, 1st Earl Roberts|Lord Roberts]], who became [[Commander-in-Chief, India|Commander-in-Chief of the Indian Army]] in the November 1885. There was a gradual \"Punjabisation\" of the Indian Army to the detriment of the other communities. The final blow for the Mahar [[troops]] came in 1892, when it was decided to institute \"class regiments\" in the Indian Army. The Mahars were not included in these class regiments, and it was notified that the Mahars, among with some other classes, were no longer to be recruited in the Indian army. The Mahar troops, who included 104 [[Viceroy's Commissioned Officer]]s and a host of [[Non-commissioned officers]] and Sepoys were demobilised. This event was regarded by the Mahars as a betrayal of their loyalty by a [[government]] they had served for over a hundred years.\n\n===1892-1941===\n{{Unreferenced section|date=November 2016}}\n\nAfter the demobilisation of the Mahar troops, there were many attempts by the leaders of the Mahar community to persuade the Government to let them serve in the Army once again. Petitions to this effect were drafted by ex-soldiers such as [[Gopal Baba Walangkar]] in 1894, and Shivram Janba Kamble in 1904. These petitions were supported in principle by the politician and social reformer [[Gopal Krishna Gokhale]], who was opposed to the Martial Races theory. They were also supported by the [[Indian National Congress]], who were also opposed to the recruiting policies of the Army.\n\nThe recruitment policies of the British Indian Army continued until the beginning of the [[First World War]] in 1914. The War forced the Government to begin more broad-based recruiting, and the Mahars were at last allowed to enlist in the Army. One battalion of Mahar troops, the [[111th Mahars]] was raised in the June 1917. However, the battalion did not see much service during the War, and in 1920 it was merged with the [[71st Punjabis]]. Finally, the battalion was disbanded in March 1921, and the Mahars were once again demobilised.\n\nThe period between the wars saw increased efforts by the Mahars to persuade the government to let them enlist in the Army. One proponent of Mahar recruitment was Dr. [[B. R. Ambedkar]], whose father, [[Subedar Major|Sub. Maj.]] [[Ambedkar family|Ramji Maloji Sakpal]] had been a soldier in the British Indian Army. However, the proposed reorganisation of the Indian Army that was to occur in the 1930s was postponed because of a lack of funds in the [[Great Depression]]. In 1939, the [[Second World War]] broke out, and once again, the Army was forced to overlook its narrow minded recruitment policies in the face of harsh necessity.\n\n===Raising of the Mahar Regiment===\n{{Unreferenced section|date=November 2016}}\n\nIn the July 1941, B. R. Ambedkar was appointed to the Defence Advisory Committee of the Viceroy's Executive Council. He used this appointment to exert pressure within the military establishment for a Mahar regiment. He also appealed to the Mahars to join the Army in large numbers. In October, the Army gave in, and the 1st battalion of the Mahar Regiment was raised in [[Belgaum]] under Lt. Col. H.J.R. Jackson of the [[13th Frontier Force Rifles]] and Sub. Maj. Sheikh Hassnuddin. The 2nd battalion was raised in [[Kamptee]] in June 1942 under Lt. Col. J.W.K. Kirwan and Sub. Maj. Bholaji Ranjane. A cap badge was designed for the regiment by Capt. E.E.L. Mortlemans, an officer of the 2nd battalion. The badge featured the [[Battle of Koregaon|Koregaon Pillar]] over the word \"Mahar\". The third battalion, the 25th Mahars, was raised in [[Belgaum]] in the August 1942 by Lt. Col V. Chambier and Sub. Maj. Sardar Bahadur Ladkojirao Bhonsale, and the 3rd Mahars were raised in [[Nowshera, Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa|Nowshera]] by Lt. Col. R.N.D. Frier and Sub. Maj. Bholaji Ranjane. During the [[Second World War]], the 1st and 3rd Mahars served in the [[North-West Frontier Province (1901\u20131955)|North-West Frontier Province]], while the 2nd and 25th were employed on internal security duties within the country. The 2nd battalion also saw service in the [[Burma Campaign]] as a part of the [[23rd Indian Division]], where they suffered 5 casualties and had one officer [[mentioned in dispatches]]. They also served in [[Iraq]] after the war as a part of PAIFORCE. In 1946, the 25th Mahars were disbanded, along with many other garrison battalions of the Indian Army. Its officers and men were largely absorbed by the other three battalions of the regiment. In the October 1946, the regiment was converted into a [[machine gun]] regiment, and the regimental centre was established at Kamptee. Following the conversion, the cap badge was changed. The new badge had two crossed [[Vickers machine gun]]s over the Koregaon Pillar, over a scroll that said \"The Mahar MG Regiment\". The three surviving battalions of the regiment served as a part of the [[Punjab Boundary Force]], and took part in escorting refugees during the [[Partition of India]].\n\n===The Border Scouts===\n{{Unreferenced section|date=November 2016}}\n\nThe Border Scouts were an irregular force formed by the people of the border villages in [[East Punjab]] during Partition. Hailing as they did from the erstwhile greater state of East Punjab (which included the present states of [[Haryana]] and [[Himachal Pradesh]]), the force had people hailing from a greater mix of ethnic, religious and caste backgrounds than was the norm in the Indian Army. They did some useful work defending villages from attacks during partition, and as a reward, were given a more permanent character as the East Punjab Frontier Scouts in 1948. They served along the border with Pakistan as border guards, and were regarded as a useful adjunct of the Punjab Armed Police. The unit was redesignated the 1st, 2nd and 3rd Battalions of the Border Scouts in 1951, with recruitment from different North Indian communities. In 1956, the decision to convert this force into Machine-Gun Regiments was taken, and the three battalions were merged with the Mahar Regiment, the only Indian Machine Gun Regiment in existence at the time. They joined the Regiment as the 4th, 5th and 6th Battalions of the Mahar Regiment, and it is to these units that the Regiment traces its mixed-class composition. The three Battalions style themselves battalions of the Mahar Regiment (Borders) even today.\n\n==Composition and Recruitment==\nThe class composition of the Regiment also changed. While 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 7th, 8th and 13th battalions were all pure Mahar battalions, the others were mixed classes right down to the smallest sub-unit level. The conversion training started in November 1963 with 1st Mahar and completed in May 1964 with 10th Mahar. The year 1965 saw all the battalions of the regiment gearing up for operations. These included the newly raised 11th and 12th battalions that had the unique composition of Bengalis, Oriyas and Gujratis - the communities that had been stamped as non-martial by the British. Their entry into the Mahar fraternity added strength to national integration-the distinctive feature which the regiment has always been proud of.<ref>[http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/india/rgt-mahar.htm Mahar Regiment<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>\n\nBattalions\n*1st [[Battalion]]\n*2nd [[Battalion]]\n*3rd [[Battalion]]\n*4th [[Battalion]] ([[Borders]])\n*5th [[Battalion]] (Borders)\n*6th [[Battalion]] (Borders)\n*7th [[Battalion]]\n*8th [[Battalion]] ([[Param Vir Chakra]])\n*9th [[Battalion]]\n*10th [[Battalion]]\n*11th [[Battalion]]\n*12th [[Battalion]]\n*13th [[Battalion]]\n*14th [[Battalion]] (formerly 31st Mahar)&(UN [[Military operation|Mission]] 2017 to 2018)\n*15th [[Battalion]] (formerly 32nd Mahar)\n*17th [[Battalion]]\n*18th [[Battalion]]\n*19th [[Battalion]]\n*20th [[Battalion]]  \n*21st [[Battalion]]\n*22nd [[Battalion]]\n <ref name=autogenerated1 />\n\n===Former Battalions===\n*25th Battalion (disbanded 1946).\n*16th Battalion (formerly 8th Parachute Regiment) (converted to 12th Mechanised Infantry in 1981)\n\n===Allied Units===\n*108th Infantry Battalion Territorial Army (based at Dehradun, Uttarakhand)\n*115th Infantry Battalion Territorial Army (based at Belgaum, Karnataka)\n*136th Infantry Battalion Territorial Army (Ecological) (based at Aurangabad, Maharashtra)\n*1st Battalion [[Rashtriya Rifles]]\n*30th Battalion Rashtriya Rifles\n*51st Battalion Rashtriya Rifles\n\n==References==\n*{{note|MarRace}} [http://www.country-data.com/cgi-bin/query/r-6146.html The Martial Races at Country-Data.com]\n{{Reflist}}\n{{Indian Army Infantry Regiments}}\n[http://www.bharat-rakshak.com/ARMY/units/114-Mahar-Regt.]\n{{https://youtu.be/cmXjoLPc0lg}}\n\n[[Category:Infantry regiments of the Indian Army from 1947]]\n[[Category:British Indian Army infantry regiments]]\n[[Category:Units of the Indian Peace Keeping Force]]\n", "name_user": "THE PB7", "label": "safe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mahar_Regiment"}
