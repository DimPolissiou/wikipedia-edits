She said, \"I watched them, and I read what they wrote, and I translated it into visuals that I needed to share as widely as possible.\" In her photography, Joan tried to break away from the traditional power structures associated with photography. She preferred to use the term \"muse\" rather than \"subject.\" She would also try to interact with her \"muses\" on equal terns. If she was photographing a nude woman, she would ask if the women wanted her to be nude as well.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/08/lens/lesbian-lives-movement-jeb.html|title=Photos of Lesbian Lives Meant to Inspire a Movement|last=Manders|first=Kerry|date=April 8, 2019|work=The New York Times|access-date=9 April 2019|issn=0362-4331}}</ref>\n\nIn an effort to ensure that affirming images and positive self-expression occurred outside of what she considered traditional patriarchal venues, Biren included her work in ''[[off our backs]]'', The ''[[Washington Blade]]'', ''[[Gay Community News (Boston)|Gay Community News]]'', and on countless LP album and book covers.<ref name=jeb_fivecollege />\n\n==Career==\nFor many years, JEB traveled the country presenting her multi-projector slideshows and running photography workshops. In the early 1990s, she moved from slideshows to film making. JEB's award-winning films have been seen on the [[Sundance Channel (United States)|Sundance Channel]] and public broadcasting stations. She is the president of Moonforce Media, a non-profit company, which produces and distributes films and videos that challenge people to work for social justice and awards The [[Tee Corinne|Tee A.

In addition, The [[George Washington University]] houses a collection of photographs used in ''Queerly Visible: 1971\u20131991''.\n\nFrom Joan Biren's oral history in the Rainbow History Project collection:\n\n{{quote|... My thing was to take pictures of the people that other people weren't taking pictures of, to make visible what was invisible ... I always try to present the entire diversity of our community. That's always very much in my mind in all of my work.\n\nThe thing about the Furies is that, for as short a time as we existed, we had a big impact.
