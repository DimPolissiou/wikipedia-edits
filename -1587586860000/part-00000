It was released on 29 April 2016, through [[Columbia Records]] and Westbury Road. The song was written by Harris and American singer-songwriter [[Taylor Swift]], who was initially credited with the [[pseudonym]] Nils Sj\u00f6berg. Rihanna and Harris had previously collaborated on her sixth studio album, ''[[Talk That Talk]]'', which included the international chart-topper \"[[We Found Love]]\" and US top five single \"[[Where Have You Been]]\", the former of which was written and produced by Harris. He played the final version for Rihanna at the [[Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival|2016 Coachella Music Festival]]. It was also played at the [[2018 FIFA World Cup Final]] after the conclusion of the match.\n\nThe single debuted at number two on the [[UK Singles Chart]]. It peaked at number three on the US [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]], becoming Rihanna's 21st top-five song and Harris's second; the song is currently Harris's highest peaking single as a lead artist. It became Rihanna's 25th and Harris's fourth chart-topper on the [[Dance Club Songs]] and also reached number one on the US [[Hot Dance/Electronic Songs]]; the single became the 12th number one for Rihanna and Harris's tenth on the sister chart [[Dance/Mix Show Airplay]]. It topped the charts in Australia, Canada, and the Republic of Ireland and peaked within the top ten of the charts in Germany, New Zealand and Switzerland.\n\n\"This Is What You Came For\" received mixed reviews from critics (some praised them for creating a catchy track, others labeled it as boring and cited Rihanna's vocals as overprocessed). A music video for the song premiered on 17 June 2016 and features Rihanna in an open cube with images projected on the inside walls.\n\n==Writing and release==\n[[File:191125 Taylor Swift at the 2019 American Music Awards.png|thumb|150px|American singer-songwriter [[Taylor Swift]] co-wrote \"This Is What You Came For\".

In it, a giant white box is shown sitting in a variety of places, such as a misty field and a forest. The scene then cuts to Rihanna, dressed in a sparkly blue jumpsuit, singing while standing and dancing inside the box. While she performs, graphics are projected onto all 5 sides around her. Lasers were the only other effects used with the video projections, and were provided by Dynamic FX. These include a variety of video effects and designs, footage of a crowd partying and running horses, and a drawing of a mountain with lightning over it. The video technology used for projections blended all angles of the backing video, so it would be displayed without skewing the image and allowing it to play back in a 3D environment. This new technology was being used for the first time on this video. This video also had many scenes and different cube designs cut from it, as the filming was cut short due to time constrains. Calvin Harris makes a brief cameo appearance in the video, driving a sports car ([[Lamborghini Aventador]]).<ref>{{cite web|url =https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOkQ4T5WO9E|title=Calvin Harris \u2013 This Is What You Came For (Official Video) ft.

It was released on 29 April 2016, through [[Columbia Records]] and Westbury Road. The song was written by Harris and American singer-songwriter [[Taylor Swift]], who was initially credited with the [[pseudonym]] Nils Sj\u00f6berg. Rihanna and Harris had previously collaborated on her sixth studio album, ''[[Talk That Talk]]'', which included the international chart-topper \"[[We Found Love]]\" and US top five single \"[[Where Have You Been]]\", the former of which was written and produced by Harris. He played the final version for Rihanna at the [[Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival|2016 Coachella Music Festival]]. It was also played at the [[2018 FIFA World Cup Final]] after the conclusion of the match.\n\nThe single debuted at number two on the [[UK Singles Chart]]. It peaked at number three on the US [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]], becoming Rihanna's 21st top-five song and Harris's second; the song is currently Harris's highest peaking single as a lead artist. It became Rihanna's 25th and Harris's fourth chart-topper on the [[Dance Club Songs]] and also reached number one on the US [[Hot Dance/Electronic Songs]]; the single became the 12th number one for Rihanna and Harris's tenth on the sister chart [[Dance/Mix Show Airplay]]. It topped the charts in Australia, Canada, and the Republic of Ireland and peaked within the top ten of the charts in Germany, New Zealand and Switzerland.\n\n\"This Is What You Came For\" received mixed reviews from critics (some praised them for creating a catchy track, others labeled it as boring and cited Rihanna's vocals as overprocessed). A music video for the song premiered on 17 June 2016 and features Rihanna in an open cube with images projected on the inside walls.\n\n==Writing and release==\n[[File:191125 Taylor Swift at the 2019 American Music Awards.png|thumb|150px|American singer-songwriter [[Taylor Swift]] co-wrote \"This Is What You Came For\".

In it, a giant white box is shown sitting in a variety of places, such as a misty field and a forest. The scene then cuts to Rihanna, dressed in a sparkly blue jumpsuit, singing while standing and dancing inside the box. While she performs, graphics are projected onto all 5 sides around her. Lasers were the only other effects used with the video projections, and were provided by Dynamic FX. These include a variety of video effects and designs, footage of a crowd partying and running horses, and a drawing of a mountain with lightning over it. The video technology used for projections blended all angles of the backing video, so it would be displayed without skewing the image and allowing it to play back in a 3D environment. This new technology was being used for the first time on this video. This video also had many scenes and different cube designs cut from it, as the filming was cut short due to time constrains. Calvin Harris makes a brief cameo appearance in the video, driving a sports car ([[Lamborghini Aventador]]).<ref>{{cite web|url =https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOkQ4T5WO9E|title=Calvin Harris \u2013 This Is What You Came For (Official Video) ft.

Within Cambodia, regional accents exist in remote areas but these are regarded as varieties of Central Khmer. Two exceptions are the speech of the capital, Phnom Penh, and that of the Khmer Khe in Stung Treng province, both of which differ sufficiently enough from Central Khmer to be considered separate dialects of Khmer. Outside of Cambodia, three distinct dialects are spoken by ethnic Khmers native to areas that were historically part of the [[Khmer Empire]]. The [[Northern Khmer dialect]] is spoken by over a million Khmers in the southern regions of [[Isan|Northeast Thailand]] and is treated by some linguists as a separate language. Khmer Krom, or Southern Khmer, is the first language of the [[Khmer Krom|Khmer of Vietnam]] while the Khmer living in the remote [[Cardamom mountains]] speak a very conservative dialect that still displays features of the [[Middle Khmer]] language.\n\nKhmer is primarily an [[analytic language|analytic]], [[isolating language]]. There are no [[inflection]]s, [[conjugation (grammar)|conjugations]] or [[grammatical case|case]] endings. Instead, [[Grammatical particle|particles]] and auxiliary words are used to indicate [[Grammar|grammatical]] relationships. General word order is [[subject\u2013verb\u2013object]], and [[modifier (grammar)|modifiers]] follow the word they modify. [[Classifier (linguistics)|Classifiers]] appear after numbers when used to count nouns, though not always so consistently as in languages like [[Chinese language|Chinese]]. In spoken Khmer, [[topic-comment]] structure is common and the perceived social relation between participants determines which sets of vocabulary, such as pronouns and honorifics, are proper.{{Contains special characters}}\n\nKhmer differs from neighboring languages such as Thai, [[Burmese language|Burmese]], Lao and Vietnamese in that it is not a [[tonal language]]. Words are [[stress (linguistics)|stressed]] on the final syllable, hence many words conform to the typical Mon\u2013Khmer pattern of a stressed syllable preceded by a [[minor syllable]]. The language has been written in the [[Khmer script]], an [[abugida]] descended from the [[Brahmi script]] via the southern Indian [[Pallava script]], since at least the seventh century. The script's form and use has evolved over the centuries; its modern features include subscripted versions of consonants used to write [[consonant cluster|clusters]] and a division of consonants into two series with different [[inherent vowel]]s. Approximately 79% of Cambodians are able to read Khmer.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Hul|first1=Reaksmey|last2=Woods|first2=Ben|title=Campaign Aims to Boost Adult Literacy|url=https://www.cambodiadaily.com/archives/campaign-aims-to-boost-adult-literacy-78943/|accessdate=7 February 2016|work=The Cambodia Daily|date=3 March 2015}}</ref>\n\n==Classification==\n{{Main|Austroasiatic languages}}\n\nKhmer is a member of the [[Austroasiatic languages|Austroasiatic]] language family, the autochthonous family in an area that stretches from the Malay Peninsula through Southeast Asia to East India.<ref name=DiffZide>Diffloth, Gerard & Zide, Norman.

Although little studied, this variety is unique in that it maintains a definite system of [[Register (phonology)|vocal register]] that has all but disappeared in other dialects of modern Khmer.<ref name=\"DiffZide\" />\n\n'''Phnom Penh Khmer''' is spoken in the capital and surrounding areas. This dialect is characterized by merging or complete [[elision]] of syllables, which speakers from other regions consider a \"relaxed\" pronunciation. For instance, \"Phnom Penh\" is sometimes shortened to \"m'Penh\". Another characteristic of Phnom Penh speech is observed in words with an \"r\" either as an initial consonant or as the second member of a [[consonant cluster]] (as in the English word \"bread\"). The \"r\", [[Alveolar trill|trilled]] or [[Alveolar tap|flapped]] in other dialects, is either pronounced as a [[uvular trill]] or not pronounced at all. This alters the quality of any preceding consonant, causing a harder, more emphasized pronunciation. Another unique result is that the syllable is spoken with a low-rising or \"dipping\" [[Tone (linguistics)|tone]] much like the \"h\u1ecfi\" tone in [[Vietnamese language|Vietnamese]]. For example, some people pronounce {{IPA|/tr\u0259j/}} ('fish') as {{IPA|[t\u0259j]}}: the {{IPA|/r/}} is dropped and the vowel begins by dipping much lower in tone than standard speech and then rises, effectively doubling its length. Another example is the word {{IPA|/ri\u0259n/}} ('study'), which is pronounced {{IPA|[\u0280i\u0259n]}}, with the uvular \"r\" and the same intonation described above.<ref>{{cite book|title=Linguistic Diversity and National Unity: Language Ecology in Thailand |author= William Allen A.

Colloquial Khmer is a [[zero copula]] language, instead preferring predicative adjectives (and even predicative nouns) unless using a copula for emphasis or to avoid ambiguity in more complex sentences. Basic word order is [[subject\u2013verb\u2013object]] (SVO), although subjects are often [[Null-subject language|dropped]]; [[prepositions]] are used rather than postpositions.<ref>Huffman, Franklin. 1967.

Kinship terms, nicknames and proper names are often used as pronouns (including for the first person) among intimates. Subject pronouns are frequently [[null-subject language|dropped]] in colloquial conversation.<ref name=msc />\n\nAdjectives, verbs and verb phrases may be made into nouns by the use of [[nominalization]] particles. Three of the more common particles used to create nouns are {{IPA|/ka\u02d0/}}, {{IPA|/sec kd\u0259j/}}, and {{IPA|/p\u02b0i\u0259p/}}.<ref name=Haiman />{{rp|45\u201348}} These particles are prefixed most often to verbs to form abstract nouns. The latter, derived from Sanskrit, also occurs as a suffix in fixed forms borrowed from Sanskrit and Pali such as {{IPA|/sok\u02b0a.p\u02b0i\u0259p/}} (\"health\") from {{IPA|/sok/}} (\"to be healthy\").<ref name=KhDict />\n\n:{| style=\"text-align: left;\"\n| {{IPA|/ka\u02d0}} || {{IPA|r\u016d\u0259hn\u0268w/}} || style=\"width:20%; text-align: center\" | &nbsp; || {{IPA|/sec kd\u0259j}} || {{IPA|deik/}} || style=\"width:20%; text-align: center\" | &nbsp;  || {{IPA|/p\u02b0i\u0259p}} || {{IPA|s\u0251\u02d0m rum'}}\n|-\n| {{abbr|{{smallcaps|nmlz}}|nominalizer}} || to live || style=\"width:20%; text-align: center\" | &nbsp;  || {{abbr|{{smallcaps|nmlz}}|nominalizer}} || to lie down || style=\"width:20%; text-align: center\" | &nbsp;  || {{abbr|{{smallcaps|nmlz}}|nominalizer}} || appropriate\n|-\n| colspan=2 | 'life' || style=\"width:20%; text-align: center\" | &nbsp;  || colspan=2 | '[the act of] lying down' || style=\"width:20%; text-align: center\" | &nbsp;  || colspan=2 | 'appropriateness'<ref name=Haiman />\n|}\n\n====Adjectives and adverbs====\n[[Adjective]]s, [[demonstrative]]s and [[numeral (linguistics)|numerals]] follow the noun they modify. Adverbs likewise follow the verb. Morphologically, adjectives and adverbs are not distinguished, with many words often serving either function. Adjectives are also employed as verbs as Khmer sentences rarely use a [[Copula (linguistics)|copula]].<ref name=ModSpok />\n\n[[Comparison (grammar)|Degrees of comparison]] are constructed syntactically. [[Comparative]]s are expressed using the word {{lang|km|\u1787\u17b6\u1784}} {{IPA|/ci\u0259\u014b/}}: \"A X {{IPA|/ci\u0259\u014b/}} [B]\" (A is more X [than B]).

The word {{IPA|/d\u0251l/}}, which normally means \"to arrive\" or \"towards\", can be used as a preposition meaning \"to\":\n:{| style=\"width:25%; height:50px\"\n| {{IPA|/k\u02b0\u0272om}} || {{IPA|\u0294aoj}} || {{IPA|ceik}} || {{IPA|mu\u0259j}} || {{IPA|c\u0251mnu\u0259n}} || {{IPA|d\u0251l}} || {{IPA|cru\u02d0k/}}\n|-\n| I ||  give ||  banana ||  one || bunch[{{abbr|{{smallcaps|clf}}|classifier}}] || toward || pig\n|-\n| colspan=7 | 'I gave a bunch of bananas to the pigs.'<ref name=Haiman />{{rp|207}}\n|}\n\nAlternatively, the indirect object could precede the direct object if the object-marking preposition {{IPA|/n\u0259w/}} were used:\n:{| style=\"width:25%; height:50px\"\n| {{IPA|/k\u02b0\u0272om}} || {{IPA|\u0294aoj}} || {{IPA|cru\u02d0k}} || {{IPA|n\u0259w}} || {{IPA|ceik}} || {{IPA|mu\u0259j}} || {{IPA|c\u0251mnu\u0259n/}}\n|-\n| I ||  give ||  pig || {{abbr|{{smallcaps|obj&nbsp;marker}}|object marker}} || banana || one || bunch[{{abbr|{{smallcaps|clf}}|classifier}}]\n|-\n| colspan=7 | 'I gave the pig a bunch of bananas.'<ref name=Haiman />{{rp|207}}\n|}\n\nHowever, in spoken discourse OSV is possible when emphasizing the object in a [[topic\u2013comment]]-like structure.<ref name=Haiman />{{rp|211}}\n:{| style=\"width:25%; height:50px\"\n| {{IPA|/tu\u02d0k}} || {{IPA|mu\u0259j}} || {{IPA|k\u0254\u014b}} || {{IPA|pram}} || {{IPA|\u0294\u0251\u014b/}}\n|-\n| boat || one || to sit || five || monk[{{abbr|{{smallcaps|clf}}|classifier}}]\n|-\n| colspan=5 | 'In a boat sit five monks.'<ref name=Haiman />{{rp|148}}\n|}\n:{| style=\"width:25%; height:50px\"\n| {{IPA|/\u028b\u026a\u0294ci\u0259}} || {{IPA|cao}} || {{IPA|lu\u0259c}} || {{IPA|m\u0268n}} || {{IPA|ba\u02d0n/}}\n|-\n| science || thief || to steal || {{abbr|{{smallcaps|neg}}|negative}} || {{abbr|{{smallcaps|compl}}|complement}}\n|-\n| colspan=5 | 'Science, a thief can not steal.'<ref name=Haiman />{{rp|211}}\n|}\n\n====Noun phrase====\nThe noun phrase in Khmer typically has the following structure:<ref name=ModSpok />{{rp|50\u201351}}<ref name=Jacob68 />{{rp|83}}\n:{{smallcaps|Noun Phrase}} = ({{smallcaps|Honorific}}) {{smallcaps|Noun}} ({{smallcaps|Adjectival modifiers}}) ({{smallcaps|Numeral}}) ({{smallcaps|Classifier}}) ({{smallcaps|[[Demonstrative]]}})\nThe elements in parentheses are optional. [[Honorific]]s are a class of words that serve to index the social status of the referent.

Word order in clauses is the same for that of the basic sentences described above.<ref name=Haiman /> Coordinate clauses do not necessarily have to be marked; they can simply follow one another.

The different registers, which include those used for common speech, polite speech, speaking to or about royals and speaking to or about monks, employ alternate verbs, names of body parts and pronouns. This results in what appears to foreigners as separate languages and, in fact, isolated villagers often are unsure how to speak with royals and royals raised completely within the court do not feel comfortable speaking the common register. As an example, the word for \"to eat\" used between intimates or in reference to animals is {{IPA|/si\u02d0/}}. Used in polite reference to commoners, it is {{IPA|/\u0272am/}}. When used of those of higher social status, it is {{IPA|/pisa/}} or {{IPA|/t\u0254tu\u0259l ti\u0259n/}}. For monks the word is {{IPA|/c\u02b0an/}} and for royals, {{IPA|/saoj/}}.<ref name =\"cl\" /> Another result is that the pronominal system is complex and full of honorific variations, just a few of which are shown in the table below.<ref name=KhDict />\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

Within Cambodia, regional accents exist in remote areas but these are regarded as varieties of Central Khmer. Two exceptions are the speech of the capital, Phnom Penh, and that of the Khmer Khe in Stung Treng province, both of which differ sufficiently enough from Central Khmer to be considered separate dialects of Khmer. Outside of Cambodia, three distinct dialects are spoken by ethnic Khmers native to areas that were historically part of the [[Khmer Empire]]. The [[Northern Khmer dialect]] is spoken by over a million Khmers in the southern regions of [[Isan|Northeast Thailand]] and is treated by some linguists as a separate language. Khmer Krom, or Southern Khmer, is the first language of the [[Khmer Krom|Khmer of Vietnam]] while the Khmer living in the remote [[Cardamom mountains]] speak a very conservative dialect that still displays features of the [[Middle Khmer]] language.\n\nKhmer is primarily an [[analytic language|analytic]], [[isolating language]]. There are no [[inflection]]s, [[conjugation (grammar)|conjugations]] or [[grammatical case|case]] endings. Instead, [[Grammatical particle|particles]] and auxiliary words are used to indicate [[Grammar|grammatical]] relationships. General word order is [[subject\u2013verb\u2013object]], and [[modifier (grammar)|modifiers]] follow the word they modify. [[Classifier (linguistics)|Classifiers]] appear after numbers when used to count nouns, though not always so consistently as in languages like [[Chinese language|Chinese]]. In spoken Khmer, [[topic-comment]] structure is common and the perceived social relation between participants determines which sets of vocabulary, such as pronouns and honorifics, are proper.{{Contains special characters}}\n\nKhmer differs from neighboring languages such as Thai, [[Burmese language|Burmese]], Lao and Vietnamese in that it is not a [[tonal language]]. Words are [[stress (linguistics)|stressed]] on the final syllable, hence many words conform to the typical Mon\u2013Khmer pattern of a stressed syllable preceded by a [[minor syllable]]. The language has been written in the [[Khmer script]], an [[abugida]] descended from the [[Brahmi script]] via the southern Indian [[Pallava script]], since at least the seventh century. The script's form and use has evolved over the centuries; its modern features include subscripted versions of consonants used to write [[consonant cluster|clusters]] and a division of consonants into two series with different [[inherent vowel]]s. Approximately 79% of Cambodians are able to read Khmer.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Hul|first1=Reaksmey|last2=Woods|first2=Ben|title=Campaign Aims to Boost Adult Literacy|url=https://www.cambodiadaily.com/archives/campaign-aims-to-boost-adult-literacy-78943/|accessdate=7 February 2016|work=The Cambodia Daily|date=3 March 2015}}</ref>\n\n==Classification==\n{{Main|Austroasiatic languages}}\n\nKhmer is a member of the [[Austroasiatic languages|Austroasiatic]] language family, the autochthonous family in an area that stretches from the Malay Peninsula through Southeast Asia to East India.<ref name=DiffZide>Diffloth, Gerard & Zide, Norman.

This dialect is characterized by merging or complete [[elision]] of syllables, which speakers from other regions consider a \"relaxed\" pronunciation. For instance, \"Phnom Penh\" is sometimes shortened to \"m'Penh\". Another characteristic of Phnom Penh speech is observed in words with an \"r\" either as an initial consonant or as the second member of a [[consonant cluster]] (as in the English word \"bread\"). The \"r\", [[Alveolar trill|trilled]] or [[Alveolar tap|flapped]] in other dialects, is either pronounced as a [[uvular trill]] or not pronounced at all. This alters the quality of any preceding consonant, causing a harder, more emphasized pronunciation. Another unique result is that the syllable is spoken with a low-rising or \"dipping\" [[Tone (linguistics)|tone]] much like the \"h\u1ecfi\" tone in [[Vietnamese language|Vietnamese]]. For example, some people pronounce {{IPA|/tr\u0259j/}} ('fish') as {{IPA|[t\u0259j]}}: the {{IPA|/r/}} is dropped and the vowel begins by dipping much lower in tone than standard speech and then rises, effectively doubling its length. Another example is the word {{IPA|/ri\u0259n/}} ('study'), which is pronounced {{IPA|[\u0280i\u0259n]}}, with the uvular \"r\" and the same intonation described above.<ref>{{cite book|title=Linguistic Diversity and National Unity: Language Ecology in Thailand |author= William Allen A.

Mon Khmer Studies 22: 1\u201326.</ref> Pre-Angkorian Khmer, the Old Khmer language from 600 CE through 800, is only known from words and phrases in Sanskrit texts of the era. Old Khmer (or Angkorian Khmer) is the language as it was spoken in the [[Khmer Empire]] from the 9th century until the weakening of the empire sometime in the 13th century. Old Khmer is attested by many primary sources and has been studied in depth by a few scholars, most notably [[Saveros Pou]], Phillip Jenner and Heinz-J\u00fcrgen Pinnow. Following the end of the Khmer Empire the language lost the standardizing influence of being the language of government and accordingly underwent a turbulent period of change in [[Morphology (linguistics)|morphology]], [[phonology]] and [[lexicon]]. The language of this transition period, from about the 14th to 18th centuries, is referred to as Middle Khmer and saw borrowing from Thai, Lao and, to a lesser extent, Vietnamese. The changes during this period are so profound that the rules of Modern Khmer can not be applied to correctly understand Old Khmer.

Coordinate compounds join two [[Bound and unbound morphemes|unbound morphemes]] (independent words) of similar meaning to form a compound signifying a concept more general than either word alone.<ref name=ModSpok />{{rp|296}} Coordinate compounds join either two nouns or two verbs. Repetitive compounds, one of the most productive derivational features of Khmer, use [[reduplication]] of an entire word to derive words whose meaning depends on the class of the reduplicated word.<ref name=ModSpok />{{rp|185}} A repetitive compound of a noun indicates plurality or generality while that of an adjectival verb could mean either an intensification or plurality.\n\nCoordinate compounds:<ref name=ModSpok />{{rp|296\u2013297}}\n:{| style=\"width:25%; height:50px\"\n| {{IPA|/\u0294\u0259wpuk/}} || + || {{IPA|/mda\u02d0j/}} || \u21d2 || {{IPA|/\u0294\u0259wpuk mda\u02d0j/}}\n|-\n| 'father' || || 'mother' || \u21d2 || 'parents'\n|}\n:{| style=\"width:25%; height:50px\"\n| {{IPA|/d\u0259k/}} || + || {{IPA|/n\u014f\u0259m/}} || \u21d2 || {{IPA|/d\u0259k n\u014f\u0259m/}}\n|-\n| 'to transport' || || 'to carry' || \u21d2 || 'to lead'\n|}\n\nRepetitive compounds:<ref name=ModSpok />{{rp|185-185}}\n:{| style=\"width:40%; height:50px\"\n| {{IPA|/c\u02b0ap/}} || \u21d2 || {{IPA|/c\u02b0ap c\u02b0ap/}} ||  || {{IPA|/sr\u0259j/}} || \u21d2 || {{IPA|/sr\u0259j sr\u0259j/}}\n|-\n| 'fast' || || 'very fast, quickly' ||  || 'women' || || 'women, women in general'\n|}\n\n====Nouns and pronouns====\nKhmer [[noun]]s do not inflect for [[grammatical gender]] or [[grammatical number|singular/plural]]. There are no [[Article (grammar)|articles]], but indefiniteness is often expressed by the word for \"one\" ({{lang|km|\u1798\u17bd\u1799}}, {{IPA|/mu\u0259j/}}) following the noun as in {{lang|km|\u1786\u17d2\u1780\u17c2\u1798\u17bd\u1799}} ({{IPA|/c\u02b0kae mu\u0259j/}} \"a dog\").

Khmer nouns are divided into two groups: mass nouns, which take classifiers; and specific, nouns, which do not. The overwhelming majority are mass nouns.<ref name=ModSpok />{{rp|67\u201368}}\n\n:{| style=\"width:35%; height:50px\"\n| {{IPA|/k\u02b0maw.daj}} || {{IPA|pi\u02d0}} || {{IPA|da\u0259m/}}\n|-\n| pencil || two || long cylindrical object[{{abbr|{{smallcaps|clf}}|classifier}}]\n|-\n| colspan=3 | 'two pencils'\n|}\n\nPossession is colloquially expressed by word order. The possessor is placed after the thing that is possessed.<ref name=Haiman />{{rp|160}} Alternatively, in more complex sentences or when emphasis is required, a possessive construction using the word {{lang|km|\u179a\u1794\u179f\u17cb}} ({{IPA|/r\u0254b\u0251h/ ~ /l\u0259b\u0251h/}}, \"property, object\") may be employed. In formal and literary contexts, the possessive particle {{lang|km|\u1793\u17c3}} ({{IPA|n\u0268j}}) is used:<ref name=ModSpok />{{rp|358}}\n\n:{| style=\"text-align: left;\"\n| {{IPA|/pu\u0259\u0294ma\u02d0\u0294}} || {{IPA|k\u02b0\u0272om/}} || style=\"width:20%; text-align: center\" | or || {{IPA|/pu\u0259\u0294ma\u02d0\u0294}} || {{IPA|r\u0254b\u0251h}} || {{IPA|k\u02b0\u0272om/}} || style=\"width:20%; text-align: center\" | or  || {{IPA|/pu\u0259\u0294ma\u02d0\u0294}} || {{IPA|n\u0268j}} || {{IPA|k\u02b0\u0272om/}}\n|-\n| friend || I || style=\"width:20%; text-align: center\" | &nbsp;  || friend || property || I || style=\"width:20%; text-align: center\" | &nbsp;  || friend || {{abbr|{{smallcaps|poss}}|possessive}} || I\n|-\n| colspan=2 | 'my friend' || style=\"width:20%; text-align: center\" | &nbsp;  || colspan=3 | 'my friend' || style=\"width:20%; text-align: center\" | &nbsp;  || colspan=3 | 'my friend'\n|}\n\n[[Pronoun]]s are subject to a complicated system of social register, the choice of pronoun depending on the perceived relationships between speaker, audience and referent (see [[#Social registers|Social registers]] below). Kinship terms, nicknames and proper names are often used as pronouns (including for the first person) among intimates. Subject pronouns are frequently [[null-subject language|dropped]] in colloquial conversation.<ref name=msc />\n\nAdjectives, verbs and verb phrases may be made into nouns by the use of [[nominalization]] particles. Three of the more common particles used to create nouns are {{IPA|/ka\u02d0/}}, {{IPA|/sec kd\u0259j/}}, and {{IPA|/p\u02b0i\u0259p/}}.<ref name=Haiman />{{rp|45\u201348}} These particles are prefixed most often to verbs to form abstract nouns. The latter, derived from Sanskrit, also occurs as a suffix in fixed forms borrowed from Sanskrit and Pali such as {{IPA|/sok\u02b0a.p\u02b0i\u0259p/}} (\"health\") from {{IPA|/sok/}} (\"to be healthy\").<ref name=KhDict />\n\n:{| style=\"text-align: left;\"\n| {{IPA|/ka\u02d0}} || {{IPA|r\u016d\u0259hn\u0268w/}} || style=\"width:20%; text-align: center\" | &nbsp; || {{IPA|/sec kd\u0259j}} || {{IPA|deik/}} || style=\"width:20%; text-align: center\" | &nbsp;  || {{IPA|/p\u02b0i\u0259p}} || {{IPA|s\u0251\u02d0m rum'}}\n|-\n| {{abbr|{{smallcaps|nmlz}}|nominalizer}} || to live || style=\"width:20%; text-align: center\" | &nbsp;  || {{abbr|{{smallcaps|nmlz}}|nominalizer}} || to lie down || style=\"width:20%; text-align: center\" | &nbsp;  || {{abbr|{{smallcaps|nmlz}}|nominalizer}} || appropriate\n|-\n| colspan=2 | 'life' || style=\"width:20%; text-align: center\" | &nbsp;  || colspan=2 | '[the act of] lying down' || style=\"width:20%; text-align: center\" | &nbsp;  || colspan=2 | 'appropriateness'<ref name=Haiman />\n|}\n\n====Adjectives and adverbs====\n[[Adjective]]s, [[demonstrative]]s and [[numeral (linguistics)|numerals]] follow the noun they modify. Adverbs likewise follow the verb. Morphologically, adjectives and adverbs are not distinguished, with many words often serving either function. Adjectives are also employed as verbs as Khmer sentences rarely use a [[Copula (linguistics)|copula]].<ref name=ModSpok />\n\n[[Comparison (grammar)|Degrees of comparison]] are constructed syntactically. [[Comparative]]s are expressed using the word {{lang|km|\u1787\u17b6\u1784}} {{IPA|/ci\u0259\u014b/}}: \"A X {{IPA|/ci\u0259\u014b/}} [B]\" (A is more X [than B]).

The word {{IPA|/d\u0251l/}}, which normally means \"to arrive\" or \"towards\", can be used as a preposition meaning \"to\":\n:{| style=\"width:25%; height:50px\"\n| {{IPA|/k\u02b0\u0272om}} || {{IPA|\u0294aoj}} || {{IPA|ceik}} || {{IPA|mu\u0259j}} || {{IPA|c\u0251mnu\u0259n}} || {{IPA|d\u0251l}} || {{IPA|cru\u02d0k/}}\n|-\n| I ||  give ||  banana ||  one || bunch[{{abbr|{{smallcaps|clf}}|classifier}}] || toward || pig\n|-\n| colspan=7 | 'I gave a bunch of bananas to the pigs.'<ref name=Haiman />{{rp|207}}\n|}\n\nAlternatively, the indirect object could precede the direct object if the object-marking preposition {{IPA|/n\u0259w/}} were used:\n:{| style=\"width:25%; height:50px\"\n| {{IPA|/k\u02b0\u0272om}} || {{IPA|\u0294aoj}} || {{IPA|cru\u02d0k}} || {{IPA|n\u0259w}} || {{IPA|ceik}} || {{IPA|mu\u0259j}} || {{IPA|c\u0251mnu\u0259n/}}\n|-\n| I ||  give ||  pig || {{abbr|{{smallcaps|obj&nbsp;marker}}|object marker}} || banana || one || bunch[{{abbr|{{smallcaps|clf}}|classifier}}]\n|-\n| colspan=7 | 'I gave the pig a bunch of bananas.'<ref name=Haiman />{{rp|207}}\n|}\n\nHowever, in spoken discourse OSV is possible when emphasizing the object in a [[topic\u2013comment]]-like structure.<ref name=Haiman />{{rp|211}}\n:{| style=\"width:25%; height:50px\"\n| {{IPA|/tu\u02d0k}} || {{IPA|mu\u0259j}} || {{IPA|k\u0254\u014b}} || {{IPA|pram}} || {{IPA|\u0294\u0251\u014b/}}\n|-\n| boat || one || to sit || five || monk[{{abbr|{{smallcaps|clf}}|classifier}}]\n|-\n| colspan=5 | 'In a boat sit five monks.'<ref name=Haiman />{{rp|148}}\n|}\n:{| style=\"width:25%; height:50px\"\n| {{IPA|/\u028b\u026a\u0294ci\u0259}} || {{IPA|cao}} || {{IPA|lu\u0259c}} || {{IPA|m\u0268n}} || {{IPA|ba\u02d0n/}}\n|-\n| science || thief || to steal || {{abbr|{{smallcaps|neg}}|negative}} || {{abbr|{{smallcaps|compl}}|complement}}\n|-\n| colspan=5 | 'Science, a thief can not steal.'<ref name=Haiman />{{rp|211}}\n|}\n\n====Noun phrase====\nThe noun phrase in Khmer typically has the following structure:<ref name=ModSpok />{{rp|50\u201351}}<ref name=Jacob68 />{{rp|83}}\n:{{smallcaps|Noun Phrase}} = ({{smallcaps|Honorific}}) {{smallcaps|Noun}} ({{smallcaps|Adjectival modifiers}}) ({{smallcaps|Numeral}}) ({{smallcaps|Classifier}}) ({{smallcaps|[[Demonstrative]]}})\nThe elements in parentheses are optional. [[Honorific]]s are a class of words that serve to index the social status of the referent.

Word order in clauses is the same for that of the basic sentences described above.<ref name=Haiman /> Coordinate clauses do not necessarily have to be marked; they can simply follow one another.

The different registers, which include those used for common speech, polite speech, speaking to or about royals and speaking to or about monks, employ alternate verbs, names of body parts and pronouns. This results in what appears to foreigners as separate languages and, in fact, isolated villagers often are unsure how to speak with royals and royals raised completely within the court do not feel comfortable speaking the common register. As an example, the word for \"to eat\" used between intimates or in reference to animals is {{IPA|/si\u02d0/}}. Used in polite reference to commoners, it is {{IPA|/\u0272am/}}. When used of those of higher social status, it is {{IPA|/pisa/}} or {{IPA|/t\u0254tu\u0259l ti\u0259n/}}. For monks the word is {{IPA|/c\u02b0an/}} and for royals, {{IPA|/saoj/}}.<ref name =\"cl\" /> Another result is that the pronominal system is complex and full of honorific variations, just a few of which are shown in the table below.<ref name=KhDict />\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

''Sooke News Mirror'', By OCTAVIAN LACATUSU March 9, 2016</ref> while he provided most of the vocals and did most of the composing. During 1970, Miller briefly left the band, who were joined on the road by Robbie King (keyboards, bass) and played at [[Expo '70]] in Japan and other gigs across Canada.\n\nIn 1971 bassist Rick Kilburn played live with Chilliwack for a short time before Miller returned later that same year when Lawrence departed. New member Howard Froese (guitar, keyboards, backing vocals) joined in 1973.\n\nThe band released several records that were moderately successful. Hit singles in Canada included \"Lonesome Mary\", which entered Cashbox January 22, 1972 <ref>Cashbox Jan 22, 1971</ref> (and was their first US charting single, peaking at #75 on the [[Billboard Hot 100]] in February 1972), \"Crazy Talk\" (#98 in the US in January 1975), and \"Fly at Night\" (#75 in the US in May 1977). The album track \"Rain-o\", a blues-based composition that appeared in different versions on their debut album, ''[[Chilliwack (1970 album)|Chilliwack]]'' (June 1970) and the later ''[[Dreams, Dreams, Dreams]]'' (January 1977), was a well-known concert favourite.\n\nChilliwack's debut was followed by two more albums: ''[[Chilliwack (1971 album)|Chilliwack]]'' in September 1971 and  ''[[All Over You (album)|All Over You]]'' in December 1972.\n\nIn April 1974 their album ''Riding High'' on Goldfish Records ([[Terry Jacks]]' label) contained one of their biggest hits, the aforementioned \"Crazy Talk\", which was produced by Jacks. This album was not released in the US until early 1975 (on the [[Sire Records]] label), where it was retitled ''Chilliwack'' (their third U.S. release to bear that title).\n\nHowever, Chilliwack had a difficult time sustaining any success because of their constant changes of label. The two Collectors albums were on Warner Brothers and Chilliwack's first five albums were on four different labels in Canada: [[Parrot Records|Parrot]], [[A&M Records|A&M]], Goldfish and Casino Records.\n\n''[[Rockerbox]]'', their fifth album, was released in December 1975 on Sire Records in the US and (with a different cover) on the little known, aforementioned Casino Records label in Canada. It was Chilliwack's least successful album in Canada.\n\nThe band was then signed to Vancouver's [[Mushroom Records (Canada)|Mushroom Records]], with distribution throughout North America.  After completing one album for the label, ''[[Dreams, Dreams, Dreams]]'', Chilliwack began work on their seventh album, to be titled ''[[Lights from the Valley]]''. The first attempt at recording proved unsatisfactory, leading to discord among the band members. Veteran guitarist Froese was replaced by [[Brian MacLeod (Canadian musician)|Brian MacLeod]], who contributed guitar, drums, keyboards and backing vocals.  The album was re-recorded; with some of Froese's vocal and guitar work, as well as percussion from session drummer Eddie Tuduri, included in the final mix. By the time of the record's release, bassist Glenn Miller and long term drummer Ross Turney had left the group. Mushroom was also having financial problems which hampered the promotion of the album after its release in June 1978.\n\nDrummer Skip Layton and former [[Prism (band)|Prism]] bassist Ab Bryant were recruited to perform with Henderson, Jamie Bowers (guitar, keyboards) and MacLeod in Chilliwack's 1978 live gigs.<ref>''Ottawa Journal'' 4 August 4, 1978 p. 47</ref> Henderson, MacLeod and Bryant then began working on Chilliwack's eighth album in 1979, joined by John Roles (guitar, keyboards, backing vocals) and drummer Bucky Berger. The Mushroom label went bankrupt abruptly shortly after the album, ''[[Breakdown in Paradise]]'', was released in December 1979. Berger was replaced by Rick Taylor shortly thereafter and the lineup of Henderson, MacLeod, Bryant, Roles and Taylor toured into 1980.\n\nChilliwack then signed with Solid Gold Records in Canada and [[Millennium Records]] in the U.S. in 1981 as a trio (Henderson/MacLeod/Bryant) and enjoyed its greatest success with this lineup, releasing the albums ''[[Wanna Be a Star]]'' (September 1981) and ''[[Opus X]]'' (October 1982). The singles \"My Girl (Gone, Gone, Gone)\" (Their first US Top 40 hit, peaking at #22 in December 1981), \"I Believe\" (US #33 in March 1982), and \"Whatcha Gonna Do (When I'm Gone)\" (US #41 in December 1982) were popular both in Canada and in the U.S.<ref name=\"bill\">{{cite book|title=The Billboard Book of  Hits |ISBN=0-8230-8285-7|author=Adam White & Fred Bronson|publisher=Billboard Books|year=1988}}</ref>  ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' wrote:\n\n{{quote|At their best, Chilliwack was the finest Canadian rock band, outrocking [[Bachman\u2013Turner Overdrive|BTO]] and outwriting [[Burton Cummings]]. But a lack of consistency kept it from international success.}}\n\nThe trio of Henderson, MacLeod and Bryant were joined by drummer Paul Delaney in the fall of 1981 through early 1982 for US promotional appearances on TV shows, like ''[[American Bandstand]]'',<ref>https://www.imdb.com/title/tt5906246/</ref> ''[[Solid Gold (TV series)|Solid Gold]]'' and ''[[The Merv Griffin Show]]'', before heading out on the road later in 1982 with an expanded lineup of Henderson, MacLeod, Bryant, [[Joey Franco]] (drums), Glenn Grayson (keyboards, backing vocals) and Dennis Grayson (keyboards, backing vocals).\n\nHenderson and MacLeod received a Best Producer [[Juno Award]] for ''[[Opus X]]''. However, echoing the Mushroom problems, Millennium Records then collapsed. MacLeod and Bryant left the band soon after, in early 1983, to devote more time to their other project, the [[Headpins]], and Chilliwack's last new studio recording, ''Look In Look Out'', was released in July 1984 with Henderson as the only continuing member, joined by session players Ashley Mulford (guitar, backing vocals, from the band [[Sad Caf\u00e9 (band)|Sad Caf\u00e9]]), [[Richard Gibbs]] (keyboards, from the group [[Oingo Boingo]]), [[Mo Foster]] (bass), [[Simon Phillips (drummer)|Simon Phillips]] (drums) and [[Tom Keenlyside]] (saxophone), with additional vocals provided by Mark LaFrance, [[Saffron Henderson|Saffron]] & [[Camille Henderson]], Dustin Keller and [[Bob Rock]].\n\nBy 1985 the band was without a record deal and Henderson cobbled together a touring only lineup made up of former member Claire Lawrence (sax, backing vocals), Jerry Adolphe (drums), Brian Newcombe (bass), Robbie Gray (keyboards, backing vocals) and Dave Pickell (keyboards). Pickell was replaced almost immediately by another former member John Roles (guitar, keyboards) and this grouping played mostly in Canadian clubs and smaller venues until Henderson disbanded the group in December 1988.\n\nOn October 6, 1991 Henderson joined fellow rockers [[Loverboy]], [[Bryan Adams]], [[Colin James]] and Chrissy Steele at a benefit show at Vancouver's 86 Street Music Hall to raise over $50,000 for Henderson's former Chilliwack bandmate, [[Brian MacLeod (Canadian musician)|Brian MacLeod]], who was fighting cancer and undergoing treatment at a Houston medical clinic. MacLeod died on April 25, 1992, aged 39.{{citation needed|date=August 2017}}\n\nIn 1989 Henderson went on to form the folk-rock supergroup [[UHF (Canadian band)|UHF]] and decided to launch a new Chilliwack lineup in 1997, made up of himself, Adolphe (drums), [[Doug Edwards (musician)|Doug Edwards]]<ref>[https://vancouversun.com/entertainment/local-arts/wildflower-hitmaker-doug-edwards-one-in-million-pop-artist-dies-at-71 \"Wildflower hitmaker Doug Edwards, \u2018one in million\u2019 pop artist, dies at 71\"].

Forbes was succeeded on guitar in 1998 by Bill's brother, Ed, and Chilliwack released a new live album, ''[[There and Back - Live]]'', in 2003.\n\nChilliwack performed at 2005's Voyageur Days Festival in [[Mattawa, Ontario]], where they appeared that July with other Canadian bands [[Moxy (band)|Moxy]], [[Toronto (band)|Toronto]], [[Trooper (band)|Trooper]], [[Goddo]], [[Killer Dwarfs]] and [[Ray Lyell]] for the thirtieth anniversary of Moxy's debut album release.\n\nOn May 24, 2010 the current members of Chilliwack (Bill Henderson, Ed Henderson, Doug Edwards and Jerry Adolphe) were joined by former members Roy 'Bim' Forbes, Ab Bryant and Claire Lawrence plus Howard Froese's son, Tyson, on acoustic guitar (standing in for his father, who had died of cancer in the mid-1990s) and Collectors singer Howie Vickers for a Chilliwack 40th Anniversary show at River Rock Show Theatre in [[Richmond, British Columbia]].\n\nSince that time, Bill Henderson has continued Chilliwack but also does duo shows with Claire Lawrence from time to time.\n\nChilliwack's original bassist, Glenn Miller, died on March 4, 2011 in Toronto after suffering from [[muscular dystrophy]].\n\nIn 2015 music fans were treated to a new music video by Chilliwack for the song \"Take Back This Land\". The song became a rallying call during the [[2015 Canadian federal election]]. \"The song wasn\u2019t just about the election\", said Bill Henderson. \"Whether it is logging or fracking or whatever else, there is still a lot more work to do in Canada.\"{{citation needed|date=November 2017}}\n\nChilliwack continues to play, mostly in the spring, summer, and early fall, at outdoor gatherings and festivals.<ref>[http://www.nanaimobulletin.com/entertainment/386825561.html \"Chilliwack rocks during Nanaimo Bathtub Weekend Launch Party\"].

''Sooke News Mirror'', By OCTAVIAN LACATUSU March 9, 2016</ref> while he provided most of the vocals and did most of the composing. During 1970, Miller briefly left the band, who were joined on the road by Robbie King (keyboards, bass) and played at [[Expo '70]] in Japan and other gigs across Canada.\n\nIn 1971 bassist Rick Kilburn played live with Chilliwack for a short time before Miller returned later that same year when Lawrence departed. New member Howard Froese (guitar, keyboards, backing vocals) joined in 1973.\n\nThe band released several records that were moderately successful. Hit singles in Canada included \"Lonesome Mary\", which entered Cashbox January 22, 1972 <ref>Cashbox Jan 22, 1971</ref> (and was their first US charting single, peaking at #75 on the [[Billboard Hot 100]] in February 1972), \"Crazy Talk\" (#98 in the US in January 1975), and \"Fly at Night\" (#75 in the US in May 1977). The album track \"Rain-o\", a blues-based composition that appeared in different versions on their debut album, ''[[Chilliwack (1970 album)|Chilliwack]]'' (June 1970) and the later ''[[Dreams, Dreams, Dreams]]'' (January 1977), was a well-known concert favourite.\n\nChilliwack's debut was followed by two more albums: ''[[Chilliwack (1971 album)|Chilliwack]]'' in September 1971 and  ''[[All Over You (album)|All Over You]]'' in December 1972.\n\nIn April 1974 their album ''Riding High'' on Goldfish Records ([[Terry Jacks]]' label) contained one of their biggest hits, the aforementioned \"Crazy Talk\", which was produced by Jacks. This album was not released in the US until early 1975 (on the [[Sire Records]] label), where it was retitled ''Chilliwack'' (their third U.S. release to bear that title).\n\nHowever, Chilliwack had a difficult time sustaining any success because of their constant changes of label. The two Collectors albums were on Warner Brothers and Chilliwack's first five albums were on four different labels in Canada: [[Parrot Records|Parrot]], [[A&M Records|A&M]], Goldfish and Casino Records.\n\n''[[Rockerbox]]'', their fifth album, was released in December 1975 on Sire Records in the US and (with a different cover) on the little known, aforementioned Casino Records label in Canada. It was Chilliwack's least successful album in Canada.\n\nThe band was then signed to Vancouver's [[Mushroom Records (Canada)|Mushroom Records]], with distribution throughout North America.  After completing one album for the label, ''[[Dreams, Dreams, Dreams]]'', Chilliwack began work on their seventh album, to be titled ''[[Lights from the Valley]]''. The first attempt at recording proved unsatisfactory, leading to discord among the band members. Veteran guitarist Froese was replaced by [[Brian MacLeod (Canadian musician)|Brian MacLeod]], who contributed guitar, drums, keyboards and backing vocals.  The album was re-recorded; with some of Froese's vocal and guitar work, as well as percussion from session drummer Eddie Tuduri, included in the final mix. By the time of the record's release, bassist Glenn Miller and long term drummer Ross Turney had left the group. Mushroom was also having financial problems which hampered the promotion of the album after its release in June 1978.\n\nDrummer Skip Layton and former [[Prism (band)|Prism]] bassist Ab Bryant were recruited to perform with Henderson, Jamie Bowers (guitar, keyboards) and MacLeod in Chilliwack's 1978 live gigs.<ref>''Ottawa Journal'' 4 August 4, 1978 p. 47</ref> Henderson, MacLeod and Bryant then began working on Chilliwack's eighth album in 1979, joined by John Roles (guitar, keyboards, backing vocals) and drummer Bucky Berger. The Mushroom label went bankrupt abruptly shortly after the album, ''[[Breakdown in Paradise]]'', was released in December 1979. Berger was replaced by Rick Taylor shortly thereafter and the lineup of Henderson, MacLeod, Bryant, Roles and Taylor toured into 1980.\n\nChilliwack then signed with Solid Gold Records in Canada and [[Millennium Records]] in the U.S. in 1981 as a trio (Henderson/MacLeod/Bryant) and enjoyed its greatest success with this lineup, releasing the albums ''[[Wanna Be a Star]]'' (September 1981) and ''[[Opus X]]'' (October 1982). The singles \"My Girl (Gone, Gone, Gone)\" (Their first US Top 40 hit, peaking at #22 in December 1981), \"I Believe\" (US #33 in March 1982), and \"Whatcha Gonna Do (When I'm Gone)\" (US #41 in December 1982) were popular both in Canada and in the U.S.<ref name=\"bill\">{{cite book|title=The Billboard Book of  Hits |ISBN=0-8230-8285-7|author=Adam White & Fred Bronson|publisher=Billboard Books|year=1988}}</ref>  ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' wrote:\n\n{{quote|At their best, Chilliwack was the finest Canadian rock band, outrocking [[Bachman\u2013Turner Overdrive|BTO]] and outwriting [[Burton Cummings]]. But a lack of consistency kept it from international success.}}\n\nThe trio of Henderson, MacLeod and Bryant were joined by drummer Paul Delaney in the fall of 1981 through early 1982 for US promotional appearances on TV shows, like ''[[American Bandstand]]'',<ref>https://www.imdb.com/title/tt5906246/</ref> ''[[Solid Gold (TV series)|Solid Gold]]'' and ''[[The Merv Griffin Show]]'', before heading out on the road later in 1982 with an expanded lineup of Henderson, MacLeod, Bryant, [[Joey Franco]] (drums), Glenn Grayson (keyboards, backing vocals) and Dennis Grayson (keyboards, backing vocals).\n\nHenderson and MacLeod received a Best Producer [[Juno Award]] for ''[[Opus X]]''. However, echoing the Mushroom problems, Millennium Records then collapsed. MacLeod and Bryant left the band soon after, in early 1983, to devote more time to their other project, the [[Headpins]], and Chilliwack's last new studio recording, ''Look In Look Out'', was released in July 1984 with Henderson as the only continuing member, joined by session players Ashley Mulford (guitar, backing vocals, from the band [[Sad Caf\u00e9 (band)|Sad Caf\u00e9]]), [[Richard Gibbs]] (keyboards, from the group [[Oingo Boingo]]), [[Mo Foster]] (bass), [[Simon Phillips (drummer)|Simon Phillips]] (drums) and [[Tom Keenlyside]] (saxophone), with additional vocals provided by Mark LaFrance, [[Saffron Henderson|Saffron]] & [[Camille Henderson]], Dustin Keller and [[Bob Rock]].\n\nBy 1985 the band was without a record deal and Henderson cobbled together a touring only lineup made up of former member Claire Lawrence (sax, backing vocals), Jerry Adolphe (drums), Brian Newcombe (bass), Robbie Gray (keyboards, backing vocals) and Dave Pickell (keyboards). Pickell was replaced almost immediately by another former member John Roles (guitar, keyboards) and this grouping played mostly in Canadian clubs and smaller venues until Henderson disbanded the group in December 1988.\n\nOn October 6, 1991 Henderson joined fellow rockers [[Loverboy]], [[Bryan Adams]], [[Colin James]] and Chrissy Steele at a benefit show at Vancouver's 86 Street Music Hall to raise over $50,000 for Henderson's former Chilliwack bandmate, [[Brian MacLeod (Canadian musician)|Brian MacLeod]], who was fighting cancer and undergoing treatment at a Houston medical clinic. MacLeod died on April 25, 1992, aged 39.{{citation needed|date=August 2017}}\n\nIn 1989 Henderson went on to form the folk-rock supergroup [[UHF (Canadian band)|UHF]] and decided to launch a new Chilliwack lineup in 1997, made up of himself, Adolphe (drums), [[Doug Edwards (musician)|Doug Edwards]]<ref>[https://vancouversun.com/entertainment/local-arts/wildflower-hitmaker-doug-edwards-one-in-million-pop-artist-dies-at-71 \"Wildflower hitmaker Doug Edwards, \u2018one in million\u2019 pop artist, dies at 71\"].

Forbes was succeeded on guitar in 1998 by Bill's brother, Ed, and Chilliwack released a new live album, ''[[There and Back - Live]]'', in 2003.\n\nChilliwack performed at 2005's Voyageur Days Festival in [[Mattawa, Ontario]], where they appeared that July with other Canadian bands [[Moxy (band)|Moxy]], [[Toronto (band)|Toronto]], [[Trooper (band)|Trooper]], [[Goddo]], [[Killer Dwarfs]] and [[Ray Lyell]] for the thirtieth anniversary of Moxy's debut album release.\n\nOn May 24, 2010 the current members of Chilliwack (Bill Henderson, Ed Henderson, Doug Edwards and Jerry Adolphe) were joined by former members Roy 'Bim' Forbes, Ab Bryant and Claire Lawrence plus Howard Froese's son, Tyson, on acoustic guitar (standing in for his father, who had died of cancer in the mid-1990s) and Collectors singer Howie Vickers for a Chilliwack 40th Anniversary show at River Rock Show Theatre in [[Richmond, British Columbia]].\n\nSince that time, Bill Henderson has continued Chilliwack but also does duo shows with Claire Lawrence from time to time.\n\nChilliwack's original bassist, Glenn Miller, died on March 4, 2011 in Toronto after suffering from [[muscular dystrophy]].\n\nIn 2015 music fans were treated to a new music video by Chilliwack for the song \"Take Back This Land\". The song became a rallying call during the [[2015 Canadian federal election]]. \"The song wasn\u2019t just about the election\", said Bill Henderson. \"Whether it is logging or fracking or whatever else, there is still a lot more work to do in Canada.\"{{citation needed|date=November 2017}}\n\nChilliwack continues to play, mostly in the spring, summer, and early fall, at outdoor gatherings and festivals.<ref>[http://www.nanaimobulletin.com/entertainment/386825561.html \"Chilliwack rocks during Nanaimo Bathtub Weekend Launch Party\"].
