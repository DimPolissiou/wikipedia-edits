She served for seven terms, including two as [[Speaker (politics)|Speaker of the House]], the first female Speaker in Arizona history.\n\nIn 1991, while she was Speaker, the Arizona legislature experienced a major political scandal called [[World Chiropractic Alliance#Lobbying, AzScam scandal, and patient solicitation scheme|AZSCAM]], which resulted in the resignation or removal of ten members of the House and Senate.  As a result, Speaker Hull instituted a number of ethics reforms to reestablish public confidence in the legislature.\n\nPolitically, ''[[On the Issues|On The Issues]]'', a non-profit and non-partisan organization which records politicians' stances on issues, considers Hull to have been a [[Centrism|centrist]] or [[Rockefeller Republican|moderate Republican]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.ontheissues.org/Jane_Dee_Hull.htm|title=Jane Dee Hull on the Issues|last=OnTheIssues.org|website=www.ontheissues.org|access-date=2018-08-31}}</ref> Her record is considered to \u00a0be [[Fiscal conservatism|fiscally conservative]] and socially [[moderate]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1997/09/05/us/once-again-arizona-secretary-state-suddenly-thrust-into-job-governor.html|title=Once Again in Arizona, Secretary of State Is Suddenly Thrust Into the Job of Governor|last=Purdum|first=Todd S.|access-date=2018-08-31|language=en}}</ref>\n\n==Governor of Arizona==\n===First term (1997&ndash;1999)===\n[[File:Jane Dee Hull 2001.jpeg|right|upright|thumb|Then-Governor Hull during a visit to the Air National Guard's alert detachment facility.]]\nHull was elected Arizona Secretary of State in 1994.

Arizona has no [[Lieutenant governor (United States)|lieutenant governor]], so the secretary of state, if holding office by election,<ref>Ariz. Const. art. V, s. 6</ref> stands first in the line of succession.\n\n===1998 gubernatorial campaign===\nHull was elected governor in her own right in 1998. This election was particularly significant because it was the first time in the history of the United States that all five of the top elected executive offices in one state were held by women:  Hull; [[Betsey Bayless]], secretary of state; [[Janet Napolitano]], [[Arizona Attorney General|attorney general]]; [[Carol Springer]], treasurer; and [[Lisa Graham Keegan]],  [[Superintendent of Public Instruction]].\n\n===Second term (1999&ndash;2003)===\nWhile she was governor, Hull's relations with home state [[U.S. Senator]] [[John McCain]] were strained. During the [[Republican Party (United States) presidential primaries, 2000|2000 Presidential primary season]] she endorsed his opponent, Texas Governor [[George W.

The resulting law promised car buyers up to 60 percent off new vehicles if they were converted to run on alternative fuels like [[propane]] or [[natural gas]], yet did not properly cap the number of buyers eligible for the program nor did it require buyers to use the new fuels. Instead of the $10 million the program was supposed to cost, it ended up costing Arizona $200 million before lawmakers changed the rules.\n\n==Post-governorship==\nHull was constitutionally barred from running for a second full term in 2002 (the Arizona constitution limits the Governor to two consecutive terms, or parts of terms,<ref>Ariz. Const. Art. V, \u00a7 1(a).</ref> even when he or she ascends to the office in the middle of a term), and she was succeeded by Janet Napolitano, who defeated [[Matt Salmon]].\n\nAfter leaving office, she spent three months in [[New York City]], as a public delegate from the United States to the [[United Nations General Assembly]] (2004).<ref name=PBS2007>{{cite news |url=http://www.azpbs.org/goldwater/2007hull.htm |title=Former Governor Jane Dee Hull \u2013 Twenty-Five Years in Arizona Government |accessdate=2009-04-20 |author=[[KAET-TV]] |date=September 23, 2007 |work=2006 Goldwater Lecture Series |publisher=[[Arizona State University]] |location=Phoenix, Arizona |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090306121955/http://www.azpbs.org/goldwater/2007hull.htm |archivedate=March 6, 2009}}</ref>\n\nAfter the death of [[Rose Mofford]] on September 15, 2016, Hull became the oldest living Governor of Arizona, in addition to being the oldest living [[Secretary of State of Arizona]].
