Mechanical beach cleaning is defined as litter and/or organic material removal that relies on the work of automatic or push machinery that rakes or sieves the most superficial layer of sand.

Beyond this zone, the land should be composed of vegetated dunes that are infrequently touched by tides. However, mechanical beach cleaning has converted many beaches into much wider expanses of flat sand, most of which remains undisturbed by the tide and void of vegetation.<ref name=\":45\" /><ref name=\":44\" /><ref name=\":43\" /><ref name=\":35\" /> Mechanical beach cleaning destroys vegetation, hummocks, and newly-formed dunes, leading to an immediate flattening of the landscape.<ref name=\":35\" /><ref name=\":45\" /><ref name=\":44\" /> Mechanical cleaning not only damages existing vegetation but deters the growth of future vegetation.<ref name=\":35\" /> Dugan and Hubbard found that the groomed portions of a beach experienced significantly lower rates of plant survival and reproduction after germination than the ungroomed sections of the same beach.<ref name=\":35\" />\n\nAs vegetation abundance and the height and presence of dunes and hummocks decrease, sand transport patterns change in a way that furthers the extent of flattened topography.<ref name=\":45\" /><ref name=\":44\" /><ref name=\":43\" /><ref name=\":35\" /> Hummocks, dunes, and vegetation act as obstacles that slow sand movement triggered by the wind. When these features disappear, the formation of future hummocks and dunes becomes more difficult and unlikely.<ref name=\":35\" /><ref name=\":45\" /><ref name=\":44\" /><ref name=\":43\" />\n\nAs beaches grow flatter and wider, the abundance and diversity of vegetation decreases further because vegetation requires stable sand dunes to take root and grow.<ref name=\":45\" /><ref name=\":44\" /><ref name=\":43\" /><ref name=\":35\" />\n\nIn this way, mechanical beach cleaning triggers a positive feedback loop that exacerbates the flattening and widening of beaches alongside the loss of vegetation abundance and diversity. Halting mechanical beach cleaning stops this cycle and can rebuild the damaged topography and lost vegetation.<ref name=\":35\" /><ref name=\":44\" /><ref name=\":43\" /> For example, Dugan and Hubbard observed that four years after stopping mechanical grooming, the San Buenaventura State Beach recovered 20 to 40 meters of vegetation, formed new hummocks and the beginning stages of sand dunes, improved sand stability, and increased the number of plants that survived beyond germination.<ref name=\":35\" />\n\n=== Best practices ===\nA number of best practices for carrying out beach cleaning have been discussed in the literature.\n\n====Combination of mechanical and manual cleaning methods====\nThis method allows urban and more intensely used beaches to manage larger quantities of litter while minimizing the environmental impact of mechanical cleaning.<ref name=\":31\" /><ref name=\":10\" /> In fact, beaches cleaned less than three times a week sustain a level of biodiversity and species abundance that is similar or only slightly lower than beaches that are strictly cleaned by hand.<ref name=\":10\" /><ref name=\":31\" /><ref name=\":32\" /> For example, Morton et al. (2015) found that mechanical beach cleaning did not affect biodiversity but concede that this likely due to the fact that the beach only underwent mechanical cleaning once to twice a week and had moved wrack from popular sections of the beaches to less commonly visited sites.<ref name=\":31\" /> Additionally, Stelling-Wood et al. (2016) studied ghost crab populations as an indicator species for overall biodiversity on sandy beaches and discovered that the frequency of mechanical beach cleaning was the most influential factor on population size. Beaches that were mechanically cleaned less than three times a week housed the highest number of ghost crabs.<ref name=\":32\" />\n\n====Reduction of quantity of beach litter through educational programs====\nEducational programs and volunteering effectively catalyze behavior change and awareness around marine pollution, leading to a reduction in marine debris and a willingness to clean that is present on beaches.<ref name=\":4\" /><ref name=\":16\" /><ref name=\":9\" /><ref name=\":18\" /> More information can be found about the benefits of educational and volunteer programs under the Public Engagement and Beach Cleaning header of this page. Decreasing the quantity of marine litter makes manual beach cleaning an easier, more effective option, even for urban, frequently used beaches.\n\n====Relocation of collections of wrack to ungroomed or less popular areas of a beach====\nIn doing so, the critical nutrient provided by wrack remains in the ecosystem, limiting disruptions to the food chain and ecosystem.<ref name=\":10\" /><ref name=\":31\" /><ref name=\":30\" /> Oftentimes, the nutrients from wrack will be redistributed to groomed portions of the beaches through wind and waves.<ref name=\":10\" /><ref name=\":31\" /><ref name=\":10\" /> For this reason, it is most important that this suggestion be implemented on beaches with consistently low tides.<ref name=\":30\" />\n\n== Public engagement and beach cleaning ==\n\nThere are three primary ways the public can learn about or participate in beach cleaning: educational programs, awareness campaigns, and volunteering. All modes of public engagement can increase awareness of the issue of marine litter, educate participants about marine litter and ocean conservation, and motivate behavior change.<ref name=\":14\" /><ref name=\":16\" /><ref name=\":17\" /><ref name=\":18\" /><ref name=\":22\"/><ref name=\":23\" /><ref name=\":4\" /> When volunteers participate in beach cleaning, they can use mechanical or manual methods.\n\n=== Educational programs and awareness campaigns ===\nEducational and awareness campaigns can be developed by schools<ref name=\":14\" /><ref name=\":16\" /><ref name=\":17\" /><ref name=\":18\" /> or promoted by government.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Vanhooren|first=Sofie|last2=Maelfait|first2=Hanneore|last3=Belpaeme|first3=Kathy|date=December 2011|title=Moving Towards an Ecological Management of the Beaches|journal=Journal of Coastal Research|language=en|volume=61|pages=81\u201386|doi=10.2112/SI61-001.70|issn=0749-0208}}</ref> Both have effectively enhanced their target audience\u2019s knowledge of marine litter, perception of the extent of the issue, and catalyzed behavior change.\n\nMultiple studies research the impact of service learning programs on students\u2019 level of knowledge accumulation and awareness of both marine litter and broader marine conservation issues.<ref name=\":14\" /><ref name=\":16\" /><ref name=\":17\" /><ref name=\":18\" /> For example, Owens (2018) studied the self-reported change in student\u2019s perception of their knowledge about ocean conservation and environmental behavior.

Beyond this zone, the land should be composed of vegetated dunes that are infrequently touched by tides. However, mechanical beach cleaning has converted many beaches into much wider expanses of flat sand, most of which remains undisturbed by the tide and void of vegetation.<ref name=\":45\" /><ref name=\":44\" /><ref name=\":43\" /><ref name=\":35\" /> Mechanical beach cleaning destroys vegetation, hummocks, and newly-formed dunes, leading to an immediate flattening of the landscape.<ref name=\":35\" /><ref name=\":45\" /><ref name=\":44\" /> Mechanical cleaning not only damages existing vegetation but deters the growth of future vegetation.<ref name=\":35\" /> Dugan and Hubbard found that the groomed portions of a beach experienced significantly lower rates of plant survival and reproduction after germination than the ungroomed sections of the same beach.<ref name=\":35\" />\n\nAs vegetation abundance and the height and presence of dunes and hummocks decrease, sand transport patterns change in a way that furthers the extent of flattened topography.<ref name=\":45\" /><ref name=\":44\" /><ref name=\":43\" /><ref name=\":35\" /> Hummocks, dunes, and vegetation act as obstacles that slow sand movement triggered by the wind. When these features disappear, the formation of future hummocks and dunes becomes more difficult and unlikely.<ref name=\":35\" /><ref name=\":45\" /><ref name=\":44\" /><ref name=\":43\" />\n\nAs beaches grow flatter and wider, the abundance and diversity of vegetation decreases further because vegetation requires stable sand dunes to take root and grow.<ref name=\":45\" /><ref name=\":44\" /><ref name=\":43\" /><ref name=\":35\" />\n\nIn this way, mechanical beach cleaning triggers a positive feedback loop that exacerbates the flattening and widening of beaches alongside the loss of vegetation abundance and diversity. Halting mechanical beach cleaning stops this cycle and can rebuild the damaged topography and lost vegetation.<ref name=\":35\" /><ref name=\":44\" /><ref name=\":43\" /> For example, Dugan and Hubbard observed that four years after stopping mechanical grooming, the San Buenaventura State Beach recovered 20 to 40 meters of vegetation, formed new hummocks and the beginning stages of sand dunes, improved sand stability, and increased the number of plants that survived beyond germination.<ref name=\":35\" />\n\n=== Best practices ===\nA number of best practices for carrying out beach cleaning have been discussed in the literature.\n\n====Combination of mechanical and manual cleaning methods==== \nThis method allows urban and more intensely used beaches to manage larger quantities of litter while minimizing the environmental impact of mechanical cleaning.<ref name=\":31\" /><ref name=\":10\" /> In fact, beaches cleaned less than three times a week sustain a level of biodiversity and species abundance that is similar or only slightly lower than beaches that are strictly cleaned by hand.<ref name=\":10\" /><ref name=\":31\" /><ref name=\":32\" /> For example, Morton et al. (2015) found that mechanical beach cleaning did not affect biodiversity but concede that this likely due to the fact that the beach only underwent mechanical cleaning once to twice a week and had moved wrack from popular sections of the beaches to less commonly visited sites.<ref name=\":31\" /> Additionally, Stelling-Wood et al. (2016) studied ghost crab populations as an indicator species for overall biodiversity on sandy beaches and discovered that the frequency of mechanical beach cleaning was the most influential factor on population size. Beaches that were mechanically cleaned less than three times a week housed the highest number of ghost crabs.<ref name=\":32\" />\n\n====Reduction of quantity of beach litter through educational programs====\nEducational programs and volunteering effectively catalyze behavior change and awareness around marine pollution, leading to a reduction in marine debris and a willingness to clean that is present on beaches.<ref name=\":4\" /><ref name=\":16\" /><ref name=\":9\" /><ref name=\":18\" /> More information can be found about the benefits of educational and volunteer programs under the Public Engagement and Beach Cleaning header of this page. Decreasing the quantity of marine litter makes manual beach cleaning an easier, more effective option, even for urban, frequently used beaches. \n\n====Relocation of collections of wrack to ungroomed or less popular areas of a beach====\nIn doing so, the critical nutrient provided by wrack remains in the ecosystem, limiting disruptions to the food chain and ecosystem.<ref name=\":10\" /><ref name=\":31\" /><ref name=\":30\" /> Oftentimes, the nutrients from wrack will be redistributed to groomed portions of the beaches through wind and waves.<ref name=\":10\" /><ref name=\":31\" /><ref name=\":10\" /> For this reason, it is most important that this suggestion be implemented on beaches with consistently low tides.<ref name=\":30\" />\n\n== Public engagement and beach cleaning ==\n\nThere are three primary ways the public can learn about or participate in beach cleaning: educational programs, awareness campaigns, and volunteering. All modes of public engagement can increase awareness of the issue of marine litter, educate participants about marine litter and ocean conservation, and motivate behavior change.<ref name=\":14\" /><ref name=\":16\" /><ref name=\":17\" /><ref name=\":18\" /><ref name=\":22\"/><ref name=\":23\" /><ref name=\":4\" /> When volunteers participate in beach cleaning, they can use mechanical or manual methods.\n\n=== Educational programs and awareness campaigns ===\nEducational and awareness campaigns can be developed by schools<ref name=\":14\" /><ref name=\":16\" /><ref name=\":17\" /><ref name=\":18\" /> or promoted by government.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Vanhooren|first=Sofie|last2=Maelfait|first2=Hanneore|last3=Belpaeme|first3=Kathy|date=December 2011|title=Moving Towards an Ecological Management of the Beaches|journal=Journal of Coastal Research|language=en|volume=61|pages=81\u201386|doi=10.2112/SI61-001.70|issn=0749-0208}}</ref> Both have effectively enhanced their target audience\u2019s knowledge of marine litter, perception of the extent of the issue, and catalyzed behavior change.\n\nMultiple studies research the impact of service learning programs on students\u2019 level of knowledge accumulation and awareness of both marine litter and broader marine conservation issues.<ref name=\":14\" /><ref name=\":16\" /><ref name=\":17\" /><ref name=\":18\" /> For example, Owens (2018) studied the self-reported change in student\u2019s perception of their knowledge about ocean conservation and environmental behavior. The study compared the responses of two groups: an undergraduate class enrolled in a seminar course supplemented by a [[Service-learning|service learning]] opportunity cleaning beaches and an undergraduate class enrolled in a traditional laboratory-based environmental science course. Students who participated in beach cleaning reported a significantly greater perception of knowledge and environmentally-friendly behavior compared to the students in the laboratory-based class. The students who participated in beach cleaning also saw a significantly greater increase in their scores for perceived knowledge and environmentally-friendly behavior compared to the other cohort.<ref name=\":16\" />\n\nEducational campaigns can spread knowledge and incite behavior change beyond the target audience. For example, Hartley et al. (2015) explains that students who participated in beach cleaning with their school encouraged their friends and family to join them in adopting mitigation and prevention behaviors.<ref name=\":14\" />\n[[File:Beach Cleaning Volunteers.jpg|thumb|Group of students from University of Vermont volunteering with the North Carolina Beach Buggy Association to clean Cape Hatteras National Seashore in North Carolina|287x287px]]\n\n=== Volunteering ===\nVolunteering improves participants\u2019 awareness and knowledge about marine litter and increases the likelihood that individuals will take continued action to address the issue.<ref name=\":14\" /><ref name=\":16\" /><ref name=\":17\" /><ref name=\":18\" /><ref name=\":22\"/><ref name=\":23\">{{Cite journal|last=Uneputty|first=Prulley|last2=Evans|first2=S.M.|last3=Suyoso|first3=Elshinta|date=June 1998|title=The effectiveness of a community education programme in reducing litter pollution on shores of Ambon Bay (eastern Indonesia)|journal=Journal of Biological Education|language=en|volume=32|issue=2|pages=143\u2013147|doi=10.1080/00219266.1998.9655611|issn=0021-9266}}</ref> For example, Hartley et al. (2015) claims that after volunteering to clean a local beach with their school, children reported engaging in mitigation and prevention behavior more frequently, such as purchasing fewer, single-use plastic items, appropriately disposing of their waste, and recycling.<ref name=\":14\" /> Uneputty et al. (1998) found that individuals who had volunteered to clean beaches continued to remove trash from beaches and not litter months after they had participated in a volunteer program.<ref name=\":23\" /> Furthermore, surveys and interviews have revealed that once individuals begin volunteering in marine conservation efforts, they want to continue.<ref name=\":22\" /><ref name=\":20\" />\n\nMultiple studies have determined that volunteers, whether organized through schools and universities or individual interest, can significantly reduce the quantity of solid waste on beaches.<ref name=\":16\" /><ref name=\":18\" /><ref name=\":23\" /><ref name=\":4\" />\n\nNumerous volunteer beach cleaning programs have been facilitated by schools that promote [[Service-learning|service learning]] opportunities.<ref name=\":14\" /><ref name=\":16\" /><ref name=\":18\" /> These studies, in conjunction with research conducted with participants that joined programs entirely voluntarily,<ref name=\":22\"/><ref name=\":15\" /><ref name=\":23\" /> have demonstrated that groups that were and were not previously concerned about marine litter can experience an increase in awareness and knowledge, as well as positive behavior change through the hands on experience and learning involved in volunteering.\n\nBeach cleaning volunteers reap the same, if not more, benefits from their participation as individuals who participate in other coastal activities.<ref name=\":17\" /> Wyles et al. (2017) studied the impact various coastal activities- beach cleaning, rock pooling, and walking on the beach- had on well being and discovered that all three led to a similar betterment in mood. However, individuals who participated in beach cleaning described a more intense sense of fulfillment when compared to the groups.<ref name=\":17\" />\n\nWhile further research has not been completed on the mental and emotional benefits of beach cleaning, volunteers who promote environmental stewardship have reported improvements in their well being.<ref name=\":24\" /><ref name=\":25\" /><ref name=\":26\" /><ref name=\":20\" />\n\n=== Public engagement and collection methods ===\nA study conducted in Catalonia in the late 1990s found that, on the beaches of\u00a0the [[Llobregat Delta]], engaging with the public through manual methods of beach cleanup improved citizen participation as compared to mechanical methods. Moving towards manual cleaning by citizens can benefit both the environment and aid in the local municipalities work of keeping the beaches clean.<ref name=\":11\">{{Cite
