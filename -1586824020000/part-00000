When he was two years old, his father moved to [[Steuben County, New York]], where he resided till 1826. His father, now a widower, having purchased some military land in Western Illinois, started on October 15, 1826, with his eldest son, and Absalom, and arrived at Fort Clark (now [[Peoria, Illinois]]), on January 1, 1827. In mid-February 1827, they arrived at the [[lead]] mines in the vicinity of [[Gratiot's Grove (Wisconsin)|Gratiot's Grove]] in Southwest Wisconsin, and engaged in the business of mining. They were soon interrupted by the Blackhawk War in 1832. The elder brother volunteered in [[William S. Hamilton]]\u2019s company, while Townsend and his father forted at [[Gratiot's Grove (Wisconsin)]], near present-day Shullsburg, WI, with Townsend serving under Gen. [[Zachary Taylor]] (\"Old Rough & Ready\"). After the war was over, Townsend returned to mining. He served during the whole of the [[Black Hawk War]] (1832) as a volunteer, under Col.

With news of the [[California Gold Rush]], Townsend resolved to try his hand at mining in that region. He fitted out a train of twelve wagons, drawn by oxen, with a company of men, in the spring of 1849, and taking the land route, started on April 16, and arrived in California on September 9.<ref name=Wisconsin1904 /> The \"Rough and Ready Company\" under Captain \"Cappy\" Townsend, composed of nine men from Shullsburg, arrived by the [[Truckee, California|Truckee]] route at a point on [[Deer Creek (Nevada County, California)|Deer Creek]], near the mouth of Slate Creek.

At the end of February 1850, Townsend took out over $40,000 (another source states $15,000), before the water failed in the spring\u2014no ditches then conveyed water from any large stream to the smaller ones, or to dry ravines.

When he was two years old, his father moved to [[Steuben County, New York]], where he resided till 1826. His father, now a widower, having purchased some military land in Western Illinois, started on October 15, 1826, with his eldest son, and Absalom, and arrived at Fort Clark (now [[Peoria, Illinois]]), on January 1, 1827. In mid-February 1827, they arrived at the [[lead]] mines in the vicinity of [[Gratiot's Grove (Wisconsin)|Gratiot's Grove]] in Southwest Wisconsin, and engaged in the business of mining. They were soon interrupted by the Blackhawk War in 1832. The elder brother volunteered in [[William S. Hamilton]]\u2019s company, while Townsend and his father forted at [[Gratiot's Grove (Wisconsin)]], near present-day Shullsburg, WI, with Townsend serving under Gen. [[Zachary Taylor]] (\"Old Rough & Ready\"). After the war was over, Townsend returned to mining. He served during the whole of the [[Black Hawk War]] (1832) as a volunteer, under Col. [[Henry Dodge]], and participated in the [[Battle of Bad Axe]] on August 2, 1832.<ref name=Wisconsin1904 /><ref>Portrait of Absalom Townsend from the Wisconsin Historical Society Archives.</ref>\n\n==Biography==\nIn 1836, he married, and settled on a farm near [[Shullsburg (town), Wisconsin|Shullsburg, Wisconsin]]. With news of the [[California Gold Rush]], Townsend resolved to try his hand at mining in that region. He fitted out a train of twelve wagons, drawn by oxen, with a company of men, in the spring of 1849, and taking the land route, started on April 16, and arrived in California on September 9.<ref name=Wisconsin1904 /> The \"Rough and Ready Company\" under Captain \"Cappy\" Townsend, composed of nine men from Shullsburg, arrived by the [[Truckee, California|Truckee]] route at a point on [[Deer Creek (Nevada County, California)|Deer Creek]], near the mouth of Slate Creek. The company styled themselves the \"Rough and Ready Company\" in honor of Townsend, who had served under Taylor (\"Old Rough & Ready\"). From this company, the California town of [[Rough and Ready, California|Rough and Ready]] derived its name.<ref name=\"Wisconsin1904\">{{cite book|author=State Historical Society of Wisconsin|title=Annual Report and Collections of the State Historical Society, of Wisconsin, for the Year ...|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZQk_AQAAMAAJ&pg=PA61|edition=Public domain|year=1904|publisher=The Society|pages=61\u2013}}</ref><ref name=Sargent1856 /> A 1958 episode of the Death Valley Days TV series called, \"Rough and Ready\", reenacts their arrival and founding of the town.\n\nConsequent prospecting by Townsend's company satisfied them that the newfound diggings were rich, and removing their camp, they prepared winter quarters by building two log cabins on the point of the hill east from and overlooking the present town of Rough and Ready. At the end of February 1850, Townsend took out over $40,000 (another source states $15,000), before the water failed in the spring\u2014no ditches then conveyed water from any large stream to the smaller ones, or to dry ravines. Townsend then returned by steamer route via San Francisco, Panama, New Orleans to Galena, IL, arriving 26 April 1850.<ref name=\"Wisconsin1904\" />\n\nTownsend fitted out a company of 32 men on his second trip to the gold fields, well supplied with horses and mules.
