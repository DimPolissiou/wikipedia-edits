The film stars [[Tim Roth]], alongside a supporting cast featuring [[Bitsie Tulloch]], [[David Dastmalchian]], [[Tate Ellington]], [[Claire van der Boom]], [[Maribeth Monroe]], [[Robin Bartlett]], and [[Sarah Sutherland]].\n\n==Plot==\nDavid is a divorced 40 something home hospice nurse.  His patient is Sarah who is dying of cancer. He fully and tenderly bathes and dresses her.  He sends her visiting family away when she needs rest.  He arrives at work to learn she has passed away.  He does not leave.  He cleans her up and dresses her one last time.  He attends her funeral. Her niece asks him if he attends all his patient's services?  She tells him Sarah really liked him.  David makes a strong bond with all his patients but at home he is alone, depressed often just sitting in the dark.  Sometimes he runs on a treadmill at a gym.\n\nThe next patient is an elderly stoke victim named John.  John was an architect.  He is mean and angry with his family but learns to like David.  David lets John watch porno.  He holds John when he cries.  David presents a picture of a house John had designed as a birthday gift.  David's boss Robert calls him into the agency to be fired.  John's family is suing for sexual harassment.  They found the porno and accuse David of John getting a hard-on while bathing.  David denies the charges but admits to working extra shifts because he was attached to John.  He tries to make one last visit and the daughter sends him away.  She says you know we are suing you.\n\nDavid had a young son that died with a terminal illness.  He has a daughter Nina in college.  He follows her on the internet and he watches her from his car.  They will meet once in a while for lunch.  David's wife had remarried but divorced again after four years.  David aimlessly runs the residential sidewalks.\n\nDavid's friend and former boss Isaac gets him a job with Martha.  She only needs him for chemo visits.  She tells him she knows about the harassment suit but still hires him.  Her cancer spreads and David is there for her.  She throws up or has a bathroom accident and he cleans it up with no judgment.  Martha lies to her daughter and reports her cancer is in remission.  Martha and David have become close.  Nina comes over one day for lunch.  Martha asks David if he will help her die.  He says no and she says he is fired.  His care continues and one day he comes to the house and injects enough medicine that she dies.  He calls in and reports she died of cardiac arrest.\n\nGreg is a 16-year-old boy confined to a wheel chair.  David is hired for one week as his regular caregiver is away.  David takes the boy to the park.  He has another angry patient.  Later David goes for one of his runs and is struck dead by a car.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col}}\n* [[Tim Roth]] as David Wilson\n* [[Robin Bartlett]] as Martha\n* [[Michael Cristofer]] as John Sterling\n* [[Nailea Norvind]] as Laura\n* [[Rachel Pickup]] as Sarah Holt\n* [[Sarah Sutherland]] as Nadia Wilson\n* [[Christopher McCann]] as Robert\n* [[Bitsie Tulloch]] as Lidia\n* Brenda Wehle as Mildred Sterling\n* Kari Coleman as Sarah's sister\n* [[Maribeth Monroe]] as Karen - Sarah's niece\n* [[Claire van der Boom]] as Alice\n* [[Tate Ellington]] as Greg\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Release==\n''Chronic'' premiered at the [[2015 Cannes Film Festival]] on 22 May 2015 and was selected to compete for the [[Palme d'Or]] at the [[2015 Cannes Film Festival]].<ref name=\"2015Cannes\">{{cite web|url=http://www.festival-cannes.com/fr/article/61323.html |title=Complement to the Official Selection |accessdate=23 April 2015 |date=23 April 2015 |work=Cannes Film Festival |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150505040811/http://www.festival-cannes.com/fr/article/61323.html |archivedate=5 May 2015  }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.festival-cannes.fr/en/article/61347.html|title=Screenings Guide|work=Festival de Cannes|date=6 May 2015|accessdate=8 May 2015}}</ref> At Cannes, Franco won the award for [[Best Screenplay Award (Cannes Film Festival)|Best Screenplay]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/live/2015/may/24/cannes-2015-palme-dor-announcement |title=Cannes 2015: Jacques Audiard's Dheepan wins the Palme d'Or |author=Henry Barnes |date=24 May 2015 |accessdate=24 May 2015 |work=The Guardian}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/cannes-2015-winners-announced-797340 |title=Cannes: 'Dheepan' Wins the Palme d'Or |author=Rebecca Ford |date=24 May 2015 |accessdate=24 May 2015 |work=The Hollywood Reporter}}</ref>\n\n==Reception==\n===Critical response===\nThe film received positive reviews from critics.

The '''R''' runs via [[Queens Boulevard]] in [[Queens]], [[Broadway (Manhattan)|Broadway]] in Manhattan, and [[Fourth Avenue (Brooklyn)|Fourth Avenue]] in Brooklyn.

He wrote his first computer program on this machine, an implementation of [[tic-tac-toe]] that allowed users to play games against the computer. Gates was fascinated by the machine and how it would always execute software code perfectly.{{sfn|Gates|1996|p=12}} After the Mothers Club donation was exhausted, Gates and other students sought time on systems including [[Digital Equipment Corporation|DEC]] [[Programmed Data Processor|PDP]] minicomputers. One of these systems was a [[PDP-10]] belonging to [[Computer Center Corporation]] (CCC) which banned for the summer Gates, [[Paul Allen]], [[Ric Weiland]], and Gates' best friend and first business partner Kent Evans, after it caught them exploiting bugs in the operating system to obtain free computer time.{{sfn|Manes|1994|p=34}}{{r|leibovich20001231}}\n\nThe four students formed the Lakeside Programmers Club to make money.{{r|leibovich20001231}} At the end of the ban, they offered to find bugs in CCC's software in exchange for extra computer time. Rather than use the system remotely via [[Teleprinter|Teletype]], Gates went to CCC's offices and studied [[source code]] for various programs that ran on the system, including [[Fortran]], [[Lisp (programming language)|Lisp]], and [[machine language]]. The arrangement with CCC continued until 1970 when the company went out of business. \n\nThe following year, a Lakeside teacher enlisted Gates and Evans to automate the school's class-scheduling system, providing them computer time and royalties in return. The duo worked diligently in order to have the program ready for their senior year.

They question who has stolen what from whom, and how things might be fixed, in an often contradictory rite of passage.

The families of international fighters and volunteers who after returning home died as a direct result of their service (such as in the case of a suicide relating to [[Posttraumatic stress disorder|PTSD]]) are also eligible to receive a medal.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\n==== Ribbon bar ====\nA ribbon bar was not issued with the medal. Instead a small number were made and presented to those that significantly contributed to the project as a token of gratitude.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://allbadges.net/en/badge/33301|title=The Medal for the Martyrs - Ribbon Bar|last=|first=|date=22 February 2020|website=All Badges|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=22 February 2020}}</ref>\n\n== The Project ==\n\n==== Initial concept ====\nThe initial concept first came about in February 2019 as an idea of SDF and YPG veteran Daniel Bourke and an Australian friend with a background in [[numismatics]]. They came up with the idea to use an ISIL 25 fals coin and repurpose it as a medal to commemorate the fallen international fighters and volunteers. The initial medal construction involved having an actual ISIL 25 fals coin (as opposed to a replica) joined to a suspension bar. This was not able to be done because the disc and suspension bar in modern medal production are made as one meaning that medal manufacturers refused to make a separate suspension bar and then join it to the coin. Another issue was that not enough coins could be sourced in time to make the right number of medals.\n\n==== Project launch ====\nAfter consulting with other international veterans and related groups, the design was updated and a [[social media]] campaign on both [[Facebook]] and [[Instagram]] was launched. The official camping and project was launched on the 12th of November, 2019, the day after [[Remembrance Day]] and [[Veterans Day]] to help raise awareness of the project and of the international fighters and volunteers who were lost.<ref name=\":3\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.facebook.com/The-Medal-for-the-Martyrs-102385111199884/|title=The Medal for the Martyrs - Facebook|last=|first=|date=12 November 2019|website=Facebook|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=12 November 2019}}</ref>\n\n==== Funding ====\nOn 10 December 2019 a [[GoFundMe]] camping was started to raise funds for the project. The campaign was promoted through the Facebook page and Instagram account. The campaign has been unsuccessfully with only raising $490 [[Australian dollar|AUD]] to date.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.the-medal-for-the-martyrs|title=The Medal for the Martyrs - GoFundMe|last=|first=|date=10 December 2019|website=GoFundMe|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=24 January 2020}}</ref> To deal with this it was decided that a small initial order of medal would be ordered and mostly payed for by one of the project organisers in Australia.\n\n==== First issue ====\nOn 31 of January, 2020 it was posted on both the Facebook page and Instagram account that the first order of medals have been placed and in production.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.facebook.com/102385111199884/photos/a.128980338540361/159489875489407/?type=3&theater|title=The Medal for the Martyrs Facebook post|last=|first=|date=31 January 2020|website=Facebook|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=31 January 2020}}</ref> on the 8 of April, 2020 It was announced on both the Facebook page and Instagram account the first issue of medals had been received and the first few were being sent out.\n\n== Design ==\n\nThe Medal for the Martyrs is constructed around a replica of a captured bronze 25 fals coin that was made and used by ISIL within [[ISIL territorial claims|territory under their control]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://twitter.com/jenanmoussa/status/881226717657956352|title=1/ #BREAK: I obtained a silver ISIS coin.

A ribbon is threaded through the suspension bar with a brooch attached behind at the top.<ref name=\":3\" />\n\nThe idea to use a captured coin for the medal was inspired by the Australian [[Battle of Cocos|Sydney Emden medal]] and the idea to reappropriate the ISIL coin came from the reappropriation of the [[Nazi Germany]] [[Iron Cross#World War II|1939 Iron Cross]] medal's ribbon for the Israeli [[Fighters against Nazis Medal]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fighters_against_Nazis_Medal|title=Fighters against Nazis Medal|last=|first=|date=|website=Wikipedia|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=|dead-url=}}</ref>\n\nIt was an intentional decision for the medal to replicate an ISIL 25 fals coin as many of these and other similar coins were taken and confiscated by fighters in areas that were liberated from ISIL. ISIL's name and motto from the obverse side were removed and replaced with the acronyms of the three main Kurdish forces and a motto.

The main reasons why it was decided to keep it on the medal was that it preaches the importance of charity which can be interpreted to preach how important it was for the recipients to volunteer themselves and ultimately pay the highest price for there acts of charity for the Kurdish, Syrian and Iraqi peoples.\n\n==== Ribbon ====\nThe ribbon in 32&nbsp;mm wide. At the centre is a 4mm red ([[Pantone#Pantone Color Matching System|Pantone]] 108) stripe flanked on either side by black (Pantone Black) stripes to symbolise the blood and loss of those that were killed. On either side of the central stripes are two 3mm light brown (Pantone 1205) stripes representing the sandy desert terrain of Syria. On the left is a 5mm yellow (Pantone Yellow) stripe flanked on both sides by 2mm green (Pantone 350) stripes, representing the flag of the YPG. On the right is a 5mm green (Pantone 350) stripe flanked on both sides by 2mm yellow (Pantone Yellow) stripes, representing the flag of the YPJ.\n\nYellow, red and green also makeup the tricolour [[Flag of North and East Syria]] which is used by the [[Movement for a Democratic Society]] (TEV-DEM), the political coalition that governs the [[Autonomous Administration of North and East Syria]] (NES) also known as [[Rojava]].\n\n==== Suspension bar ====\nOn the front facing side of the suspension bar is the boxed in text \"ROJAVA\", the Kurdish name of the semi-autonomous region of north-eastern Syria and the main region in which the recipients fought in.

They came up with the idea to use an ISIL 25 fals coin and repurpose it as a medal to commemorate the fallen international fighters and volunteers. The initial medal construction involved having an actual ISIL 25 fals coin (as opposed to a replica) joined to a suspension bar. This was not able to be done because the disc and suspension bar in modern medal production are made as one meaning that medal manufacturers refused to make a separate suspension bar and then join it to the coin. Another issue was that not enough coins could be sourced in time to make the right number of medals.\n\n==== Project launch ====\nAfter consulting with other international veterans and related groups, the design was updated and a [[social media]] campaign on both [[Facebook]] and [[Instagram]] was launched. The official camping and project was launched on the 12th of November, 2019, the day after [[Remembrance Day]] and [[Veterans Day]] to help raise awareness of the project and of the international fighters and volunteers who were lost.<ref name=\":3\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.facebook.com/The-Medal-for-the-Martyrs-102385111199884/|title=The Medal for the Martyrs - Facebook|last=|first=|date=12 November 2019|website=Facebook|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=12 November 2019}}</ref>\n\n==== Funding ====\nOn 10 December 2019 a [[GoFundMe]] camping was started to raise funds for the project. The campaign was promoted through the Facebook page and Instagram account.

ISIL's name and motto from the obverse side were removed and replaced with the acronyms of the three main Kurdish forces and a motto. This was deliberately done to show the liberation of and destruction of ISIL's so-called \"[[caliphate]]\" as well as symbolising an attack on and eradication of their extremist and harmful ideology.\n\nThe medal was manufactured and assembled by Cash's Awards and Promotion Solutions located in [[Frankston, Victoria|Frankston]], [[Australia]]. \n[[File:ISIS_25_Ful\u00fbs_coin_obverse.jpg|thumb|The obverse side of the ISIL 25 fals coin that the medal's obverse design was modelled from.]]\n\n==== Obverse ====\nThe obverse of the medal is a replica of the obverse side of an ISIL 25 fals coin.
