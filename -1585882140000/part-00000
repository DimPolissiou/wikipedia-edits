The instrument that detected the anomaly was a Nuclear Enterprises gamma ray spectrometer using a Thallium doped Sodium Iodide cylindrical crystal. At time of discovery the aircraft was flying at an altitude of 100 meters. The anomaly could still be detected at almost 3000 feet. \nThe Aircraft was a Britten Norman Islander Registration VH-FLE. The crew members on board were Bill Hay, the pilot, Harvey Morton, the navigator and Frank Lanza, the instruments operator that actually first recognized the significance of the anomaly.\n\n\nThe Ranger No. 1 and Ranger No. 3 ore bodies occur in the Cahill [[formation (geology)|Formation]], consisting of Lower [[Proterozoic]] [[metasediment]]s, located in the [[Alligator Rivers]] Uranium Field.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Zoellner|first1=Tom|title=Uranium|date=2009|publisher=Penguin Books|location=New York|isbn=9780143116721|pages=180-181}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last1=Nash|first1=J.

Owing to the environmental sensitivity of the site, a special statutory authority, the [[Supervising Scientist]], was created to provide oversight of the operation and conduct environmental research in the region.\n\nRanger mine covers two of a line of uranium orebodies that extend from near [[Nourlangie Rock]] in Kakadu north-eastwards to Koongarra, underneath Mount Brockman, then northwards through the Ranger One line of orebodies (in order Number 2, Number 1, and Number 3), then via Hades Flat, where there is uranium mineralisation, to Jabiluka where the line turns westward through the Barote and Ranger 4 orebodies. The mine covers No 1 Orebody and No 3 Orebody. No 2 orebody was excluded from the mining lease at the request of the traditional owners and included in Kakadu National Park. From Ranger 4 the line again turns northwards and then swings westward round an Archaean basement dome before turning south towards Nourlangie Rock again. Uranium mineralisation is known at several other places along this line but has never been explored in detail because of the creation of Kakadu. The name 'Ranger' for the series of discoveries made by [[Geopeko Limited]], the exploration arm of the Australian mining company Peko-Wallsend Limited, in the period 1969 to 1972, was thought up by Judy Ryan, the wife of the geologist in charge of the program. Koongarra and Jabiluka were retained by the companies that found them: Noranda Australia and Pancontinental Mining respectively, although since sold to other parties. The other discoveries are enclosed in the National Park, locking up an energy source that is estimated to be greater than the oil reserves of Saudi Arabia. (12)\n\nEnergy Resources of Australia Ltd (ERA) was named Explorer of the Year at the sixth annual Australian Mining Prospect Awards held in Sydney on Wednesday 11 November 2009. During 2008, ERA's exploration programme identified a very significant mineral resource adjacent to the existing Ranger 3 operating pit. The area, known as Ranger 3 Deeps, is estimated to contain 34 thousand tonnes of contained uranium oxide, and ranks among the world's most significant uranium discoveries in recent years.<ref>http://www.energyres.com.au/media/38_media_releases_2447.asp</ref>\n\n==Ranger 3 Deeps==\nERA is constructing a $120 million Ranger 3 Deeps exploration decline to conduct close spaced underground exploration drilling and explore areas adjacent to the Ranger 3 Deeps resource.  The Ranger 3 Deeps mineralised zone contains an estimated 34,000 tonnes of uranium oxide, and represents one of the most significant recent uranium discoveries world-wide.\n\nIn parallel with the construction of the exploration decline, ERA began a $57 million project to prepare a Prefeasibility Study into the potential development of a Ranger 3 Deeps underground mine.  This Study will determine the economic viability of the project, optimise mining methods, and confirm metallurgical performance and production rates. Environmental studies will also be conducted.  ERA will also consult further with the Gundjeihmi Aboriginal Corporation as a component of a broader social impact assessment.<ref>http://www.energyres.com.au/whatwedo/2324_ranger_3_deeps_exploration_decline.asp</ref>\n\nERA formally commenced the statutory approval process for the proposed Ranger 3 Deeps underground mine with the submission of a referral to the Commonwealth Department of Sustainability, Environment, Water Population and Communities under the Environmental Protection and Biodiversity Control Act 1999 in January 2013. At the same time, ERA separately lodged a notice of intent with the Northern Territory Environment Protection Authority under the Northern Territory Environmental Assessment Act.\n\n== Ore processing ==\n\nOre is ground, then leached with [[sulfuric acid]]. Uranium is removed using [[kerosene]] with [[amine]] then stripped with [[ammonium sulfate]] solution and gaseous [[ammonia]].

The orebody was discovered in late 1969, and the mine commenced operation in 1980, reaching full production of [[uranium oxide]] in 1981. It is operated by [[Energy Resources of Australia]], a 68% subsidiary of [[Rio Tinto Group]]. Uranium mined at Ranger is sold for use in [[nuclear power station]]s in Asia, Europe and North America.<ref name=\"UIC\"/>\n\nThe original orebody was completely mined out by the end of 1995, although some ore remains stockpiled. A second orebody (\"Ranger 3\") began mining in 1997. Both have been [[open-pit mining|open-pit]] mines. Open cut mining finished at Ranger in late 2012 and the mine is now processing stockpiled ore.<ref name=acf13/>\n\nAs of 2013, the ageing Ranger mine has been incurring financial losses as a result of the continuing market slump which has followed the 2011 [[Fukushima nuclear disaster]].

The instrument that detected the anomaly was a Nuclear Enterprises gamma ray spectrometer using a Thallium doped Sodium Iodide cylindrical crystal. At time of discovery the aircraft was flying at an altitude of 100 meters. The anomaly could still be detected at almost 3000 feet. \nThe Aircraft was a Britten Norman Islander Registration VH-FLE. The crew members on board were Bill Hay, the pilot, Harvey Morton, the navigator and Frank Lanza, the instruments operator that actually first recognized the significance of the anomaly.\n\n\nThe Ranger No. 1 and Ranger No. 3 ore bodies occur in the Cahill [[formation (geology)|Formation]], consisting of Lower [[Proterozoic]] [[metasediment]]s, located in the [[Alligator Rivers]] Uranium Field.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Zoellner|first1=Tom|title=Uranium|date=2009|publisher=Penguin Books|location=New York|isbn=9780143116721|pages=180-181}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last1=Nash|first1=J.

Owing to the environmental sensitivity of the site, a special statutory authority, the [[Supervising Scientist]], was created to provide oversight of the operation and conduct environmental research in the region.\n\nRanger mine covers two of a line of uranium orebodies that extend from near [[Nourlangie Rock]] in Kakadu north-eastwards to Koongarra, underneath Mount Brockman, then northwards through the Ranger One line of orebodies (in order Number 2, Number 1, and Number 3), then via Hades Flat, where there is uranium mineralisation, to Jabiluka where the line turns westward through the Barote and Ranger 4 orebodies. The mine covers No 1 Orebody and No 3 Orebody. No 2 orebody was excluded from the mining lease at the request of the traditional owners and included in Kakadu National Park. From Ranger 4 the line again turns northwards and then swings westward round an Archaean basement dome before turning south towards Nourlangie Rock again. Uranium mineralisation is known at several other places along this line but has never been explored in detail because of the creation of Kakadu. The name 'Ranger' for the series of discoveries made by [[Geopeko Limited]], the exploration arm of the Australian mining company Peko-Wallsend Limited, in the period 1969 to 1972, was thought up by Judy Ryan, the wife of the geologist in charge of the program. Koongarra and Jabiluka were retained by the companies that found them: Noranda Australia and Pancontinental Mining respectively, although since sold to other parties. The other discoveries are enclosed in the National Park, locking up an energy source that is estimated to be greater than the oil reserves of Saudi Arabia. (12)\n\nEnergy Resources of Australia Ltd (ERA) was named Explorer of the Year at the sixth annual Australian Mining Prospect Awards held in Sydney on Wednesday 11 November 2009. During 2008, ERA's exploration programme identified a very significant mineral resource adjacent to the existing Ranger 3 operating pit. The area, known as Ranger 3 Deeps, is estimated to contain 34 thousand tonnes of contained uranium oxide, and ranks among the world's most significant uranium discoveries in recent years.<ref>http://www.energyres.com.au/media/38_media_releases_2447.asp</ref>\n\n==Ranger 3 Deeps==\nERA is constructing a $120 million Ranger 3 Deeps exploration decline to conduct close spaced underground exploration drilling and explore areas adjacent to the Ranger 3 Deeps resource.  The Ranger 3 Deeps mineralised zone contains an estimated 34,000 tonnes of uranium oxide, and represents one of the most significant recent uranium discoveries world-wide.\n\nIn parallel with the construction of the exploration decline, ERA began a $57 million project to prepare a Prefeasibility Study into the potential development of a Ranger 3 Deeps underground mine.  This Study will determine the economic viability of the project, optimise mining methods, and confirm metallurgical performance and production rates. Environmental studies will also be conducted.  ERA will also consult further with the Gundjeihmi Aboriginal Corporation as a component of a broader social impact assessment.<ref>http://www.energyres.com.au/whatwedo/2324_ranger_3_deeps_exploration_decline.asp</ref>\n\nERA formally commenced the statutory approval process for the proposed Ranger 3 Deeps underground mine with the submission of a referral to the Commonwealth Department of Sustainability, Environment, Water Population and Communities under the Environmental Protection and Biodiversity Control Act 1999 in January 2013. At the same time, ERA separately lodged a notice of intent with the Northern Territory Environment Protection Authority under the Northern Territory Environmental Assessment Act.\n\n== Ore processing ==\n\nOre is ground, then leached with [[sulfuric acid]]. Uranium is removed using [[kerosene]] with [[amine]] then stripped with [[ammonium sulfate]] solution and gaseous [[ammonia]]. [[Ammonium diuranate]] is precipitated by increased [[pH]] and converted to uranium oxide (U<sub>3</sub>O<sub>8</sub>) in a furnace.<ref name=\"UIC\">{{cite web |url=http://world-nuclear.org/info/inf48.html |work=Australia's Uranium Mines |title=Ranger |publisher=World Nuclear Association |accessdate=12 January 2009}}</ref>\n\nIn early 2006, ERA announced an expansion to the ore processing plant which will allow production to extend into lower-grade material and in November 2006 the company announced plans to invest in a [[laterite]] processing plant, which will allow it to process ore with a high clay content that has been stockpiled since the mine began operating.

At least two dams have been constructed on the Ili's left tributary, the Tekes River, and the Qiapuqihai Hydropower Station (\u6070\u752b\u5176\u6d77\u6c34\u7535\u7ad9)  in [[Tokkuztara County]] ({{coord|43|18|14|N|82|29|05|E|display=inline|region:CN-62_type:landmark}}). There is also another smaller dam at {{coord|43|23|41|N|82|29|20|E|display=inline|region:CN-62_type:landmark}}, on the border of Tokkuztara and [[K\u00fcnes County|K\u00fcnes]] Counties.\n\n== Kazakh region ==\n[[File:Kapchigai lake.jpg|thumb|On the Kapchagay Reservoir]]\nThe region of Kazakhstan partially drained by the Ili and its tributaries is known in Kazakh as [[Zhetysu]] ('Seven Rivers'). In Russian it is known as [[Semirechye]] (meaning the same).\n\nThe [[Kapshagay Hydroelectric Power Plant]] was constructed between 1965 and 1970<ref>Kezer K, Matsuyama H 2006:''Decrease of river runoff in the Lake Balkhash basin in Central Asia''. Hydrological Processes Vol. 20 Is. 6 Pp 1407\u20131423</ref> near [[Kapchagay]] in the middle reaches of the Ili River. This currently comprises the [[Kapchagay Reservoir]], an artificial {{convert|110|km|mi}} long lake north of [[Almaty]].\n\nThe Tamgaly-Tas, a protected site that comprises [[rock drawings]], is located {{convert|20|km|mi}} downstream along the Ili River. The name ''Tamgaly'' in [[Kazakh language|Kazakh]] means \"painted\" or \"marked place\" (''Tas'' means \"stone\").\n\n== Ili Delta ==\n[[File:Balkhash labeled eng.jpg|thumbnail|Balkhash lake with Ili delta]]\nThe Ili River flows into the southeastern edge of [[Lake Balkhash]], where it forms a large delta of about {{convert|8000|km2|mi2}}. The delta is situated between the [[Saryesik-Atyrau Desert]] and the Taukum Desert. An area of 9,766 km<sup>2</sup> (3,771 sq mi) within the delta has been designated as a [[Ramsar Convention|Ramsar Site]]. This site has 427 species of plants and 345 species of animals, including important populations of rare species ([[Dalmatian pelican]], [[goitered gazelle]], [[marbled polecat]], [[white-headed duck]], [[red-breasted goose]], [[ship sturgeon]], and others).<ref name=\"RSIS\"/> The delta has also become popular amongst anglers for its [[wels catfish]], which can grow up to over {{convert|300|lb|abbr=on}}. The Ili river ranks third in [[Kazakhstan]] after the [[Irtysh river]] and the Ural river in terms of water content.\n\nThe Government of Kazakhstan plans to join the three sanctuaries Balkash, Karoy and Kukan (situated in the delta) into one National Park.<ref>Masha Vinokurova (Press officer), Olga Pereladova (Head of the WWF Central Asia Programme): [http://www.wwf.ru/resources/news/article/eng/9130 Kazakhstan names large inland delta], WWF Information February, 2012</ref> Until 1948, the delta was a refuge of the extinct [[Caspian tiger]]. An [[Siberian Tiger Introduction Project|introduction]] of the [[Siberian tiger]] to the delta has been proposed on account that it is a genetically close relative of the Caspian tiger. A large population of [[wild boar]], the main prey base of the Caspian tiger, can be still found in the delta. There is also a small population of roe deer. In the drier steppes to the south of the delta live [[Saiga antelope|saiga antelopes]] and [[Goitered gazelle|goitered gazelles]].\n\nReintroduction of the [[Bactrian deer]], another prey of the Caspian tiger, is currently under consideration. Another potential prey species considered to be reintroduced  is the [[Asiatic wild ass]].<ref>Hartmut Jungius (2010). ''[http://www.wwf.ru/publ/book/eng/460 Feasibility Study on the Possible Restoration of the Caspian Tiger in Central Asia] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111117071512/http://wwf.ru/publ/book/eng/460 |date=2011-11-17 }}''.

{"title_page": "Carpet", "text_new": "{{short description|Textile floor covering}}\n{{Other uses}}\n{{more citations needed|date=March 2017}}\n[[File:Ardabil Carpet.jpg|thumb|One of the [[Ardabil Carpet]]s]]\n[[File:Wollteppich_1.jpg|thumb|A small rug]]\n\nA '''carpet''' is a [[textile]] [[floor covering]] typically consisting of an upper layer of [[Pile (textile)|pile]] attached to a backing. The pile was traditionally made from wool, but since the 20th century, synthetic fibers such as [[polypropylene]], [[nylon]] or [[polyester]] are often used, as these fibers are less expensive than wool. The pile usually consists of twisted tufts that are typically heat-treated to maintain their structure. The term ''carpet'' is often used interchangeably with the term ''rug'', although rugs are typically considered to be smaller than a room and not attached to the floor.\n\nCarpets are used for a variety of purposes, including insulating a person's feet from a cold tile or concrete floor, making a room more comfortable as a place to sit on the floor (e.g., when playing with children or as a [[prayer rug]]), reducing sound from walking (particularly in [[apartment buildings]]), and adding decoration or colour to a room. Carpets can be made in any colour by using differently dyed fibers. Carpets can have many different types of patterns and motifs used to decorate the surface. Carpets are used in industrial and commercial establishments such as retail stores and [[hotel]]s and in private homes. Today, a huge range of carpets and rugs are available at many price and quality levels, ranging from inexpensive, synthetic carpets that are [[mass production|mass-produced]] in [[factory|factories]] and used in commercial buildings to costly hand-knotted wool rugs that are used in private homes of wealthy families.\n\nCarpets can be produced on a [[loom]] quite similar to [[woven fabric]], made using needle [[felt]]s, knotted by hand (in [[oriental rug]]s), made with their pile injected into a backing material (called tufting), flatwoven, made by hooking wool or cotton through the meshes of a sturdy fabric, or [[embroidery|embroidered]]. Carpet is commonly made in widths of {{convert|12|ft|m}} and {{convert|15|ft|m}} in the US and {{Convert|4|m|abbr=on}} and {{Convert|5|m|abbr=on}} in Europe. Since the 19th and 20th century, where necessary for wall-to-wall carpet, different widths of carpet can be seamed together with a seaming iron and seam tape (formerly it was [[sewing|sewn]] together) and fixed to a floor over a cushioned [[underlay]] (pad) using nails, [[tack strip]]s (known in the UK as gripper rods), adhesives, or occasionally decorative metal [[stair rod]]s. Wall-to-wall carpet is distinguished from rugs or [[mat]]s, which are loose-laid floor coverings, as wall-to-wall carpet is fixed to the floor and covers a much larger area.\n\nThe [[GoodWeave]] labelling scheme used throughout [[Europe]] and [[North America]] assures that child labour has not been used: importers pay for the labels, and the revenue collected is used to monitor centres of production and educate previously exploited children.<ref name=\"autogenerated1\">{{cite web|url=http://www.GoodWeave.org/index.php?cid=13 |title=About the GoodWeave label |publisher=Goodweave.org |date= |accessdate=2012-01-26}}</ref>\n\n==Etymology and usage==\n[[File:A carpet seller in Jaipur.jpg|thumb|right|upright|A carpet seller in [[Jaipur]], India]]\nThe term ''[[wikt:carpet|carpet]]'' comes from [[Old French]] ''carpite''. One derivation of the term states that the French term came from the [[Old Italian]] ''carpita'', from the verb \"carpire\" meaning ''to pluck''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thefreedictionary.com/carpet |title=Definition of carpet|publisher=Thefreedictionary.com |date= |accessdate=2013-10-04}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/carpet |title=Carpet - Definition |publisher=Merriam-webster.com |date=2012-08-31 |accessdate=2013-10-04}}</ref> The ''Online Etymology Dictionary'' states that the term \"carpet\" was first used in English in the late 13th century, with the meaning \"coarse cloth\", and by the mid-14th century, \"tablecloth, [or] bedspread\".<ref name=\"etymonline1\">{{cite web|url=https://www.etymonline.com/search?q=carpet|title=carpet - Search Online Etymology Dictionary|website=www.etymonline.com}}</ref> The ''Online Etymology Dictionary'' states that the term comes \"...from Old French carpite \"heavy decorated cloth, carpet,\" from Medieval Latin or Old Italian carpita \"thick woolen cloth,\" probably from Latin carpere \"to card, pluck,\" probably so called because it was made from unraveled, shred[d]ed, \"plucked\" fabric\".<ref name=\"etymonline1\"/> The meaning of the term \"carpet\" shifted in the 15th century to refer to floor coverings.<ref name=\"etymonline1\"/>\n\nThe term \"carpet\" is often used interchangeably with the term \"rug\". Some sources define a carpet as stretching from wall to wall.<ref>How It's Made, Season 2, Episode 7</ref> Another definition treats rugs as of lower quality or of smaller size, with carpets quite often having finished ends. A third common definition is that a carpet is permanently fixed in place while a rug is simply laid out on the floor. Historically, the term \"carpet\" was also applied to table and wall coverings, as carpets were not commonly used on the floor in European interiors until the 15th century.\n\nThe term \"rug\" was first used in English in the 1550s, with the meaning \"coarse fabric\". The term is of \"...Scandinavian origin; compare Norwegian dialectal rugga \"coarse coverlet,\" from [[Old Norse]] rogg \"shaggy tuft,\" from Proto-Germanic *rawwa-, perhaps related to rag (n.) and rough (adj.).\"<ref name=\"etymonline2\">{{cite web|url=https://www.etymonline.com/search?q=rug|title=rug - Search Online Etymology Dictionary|website=www.etymonline.com}}</ref> The meaning of \"rug\" \"...evolved to \"coverlet, wrap\" (1590s), then \"mat for the floor\" (1808)\".<ref name=\"etymonline2\"/>\n\n==Types==\n[[File:Moden carpet illustrating camel caravan on Silk Road. Kashgar.jpg|thumb|left|Modern carpet illustrating a camel caravan on the [[Silk Road]]]]\n\n===Woven===\nThe carpet is produced on a [[loom]] quite similar to [[woven fabric]]. The pile can be [[plush]] or [[Berber carpet|Berber]]. Plush carpet is a cut [[Pile (textile)|pile]] and Berber carpet is a loop pile. There are new styles of carpet combining the two styles called cut and loop carpeting. Normally many colored yarns are used and this process is capable of producing intricate patterns from predetermined designs (although some limitations apply to certain weaving methods with regard to accuracy of pattern within the carpet). These carpets are usually the most expensive due to the relatively slow speed of the manufacturing process. These are very famous in Iran, India, Pakistan, and Arabia.\n\n===Needle felt===\n[[File:Toranj - special circular design of Iranian carpets.JPG|thumbnail|A [[Persian carpet#Field design - medallions and borders|''toranj'' medallion]], a common design in [[Persian carpets]]]]\nThese carpets are more technologically advanced. Needle [[felt]]s are produced by intermingling and felting individual [[synthetic fiber]]s using barbed and forked needles forming an extremely durable carpet. These carpets are normally found in commercial settings such as hotels and restaurants where there is frequent traffic.\n\n===Knotted===\n{{main|Knotted-pile carpet}}\n[[File:Carpet in Preparation on a Carpet Loom.jpg|thumb|A traditional rug being woven on a carpet [[loom]]]]\nOn a '''knotted pile''' carpet (formally, a \"supplementary weft cut-loop pile\" carpet), the structural [[weft]] threads alternate with a supplementary weft that rises at right angles to the surface of the weave. This supplementary weft is attached to the [[Warp (weaving)|warp]] by one of three knot types (see below), such as [[shag carpet]] which was popular in the 1970s, to form the pile or [[nap (textile)|nap]] of the carpet. Knotting by hand is most prevalent in [[oriental rug]]s and carpets. Kashmir carpets are also hand-knotted. Pile carpets, like flat carpets, can be woven on a loom. Both vertical and horizontal looms have been used in the production of European and oriental carpets. The warp threads are set up on the frame of the loom before weaving begins. A number of weavers may work together on the same carpet. A row of knots is completed and cut. The knots are secured with (usually one to four) rows of weft. The warp in woven carpet is usually cotton and the weft is jute.{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}}\n\nThere are several styles of knotting, but the two main types of knot are the '''symmetrical''' (also called Turkish or [[Ghiordes knot|Ghiordes]]) and '''asymmetrical''' (also called Persian or [[Senna knot|Senna]]). Contemporary centres of knotted carpet production are: [[Lahore]] and [[Peshawar]] ([[Pakistan]]), [[Kashmir]] ([[India]]), [[Mirzapur]] and [[Bhadohi]] ([[India]]),<ref name=\"to\">{{cite news|url=http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2010-09-09/varanasi/28226568_1_bhadohi-mirzapur-bhadohi-carpet-carpet-manufacturers-association|title=Famed Bhadohi carpet gets GI tag|date=September 9, 2010|work=The Times of India}}</ref>[[Tabriz]] ([[Iran]]), [[Afghanistan]], [[Armenia]], [[Azerbaijan]], [[Turkey]], [[Northern Africa]], [[Nepal]], [[Spain]], [[Turkmenistan]], and [[Tibetan rugs|Tibet]]. The importance of carpets in the culture of Turkmenistan is such that [[Flag of Turkmenistan|the national flag]] features a vertical red stripe near the hoist side, containing five carpet guls (designs used in producing rugs). Kashmir is known for handknotted carpets of silk or wool. The [[GoodWeave]] labelling scheme used throughout [[Europe]] and [[North America]] assures that child labour has not been used: importers pay for the labels, and the revenue collected is used to monitor centres of production and educate previously exploited children.<ref name=\"autogenerated1\"/>\n\n===Tufted===\n[[File:Swatches of carpet 1.jpg|thumb|[[Textile sample|Swatches]] of [[Tufting|tufted]] carpet]]\n[[Image:OurikaValleyCarpets.jpg|thumb|Drying carpets in a village workshop at the [[Ourika Valley|Ourika Valley, Morocco]]]]\nThese are carpets that have their pile injected into a backing material, which is itself then bonded to a secondary backing made of a woven [[hessian (cloth)|hessian]] weave or a man made alternative to provide stability. The pile is often sheared in order to achieve different textures. This is the most common method of manufacturing of domestic carpets for floor covering purposes in the world.\n\n===Others===\nA '''flatweave''' carpet is created by interlocking warp (vertical) and weft (horizontal) threads. Types of oriental flatwoven carpet include [[kilim]], [[soumak]], [[plain weave]], and [[tapestry weave]]. Types of European flatwoven carpets include Venetian, Dutch, [[damask]], list, [[haircloth]], and ingrain (aka double cloth, two-ply, triple cloth, or three-ply).\n\nA '''hooked rug''' is a simple type of rug handmade by pulling strips of cloth such as wool or cotton through the meshes of a sturdy fabric such as burlap. This type of rug is now generally made as a [[handicraft]]. The process of creating a hooked rug is called [[Rug hooking]]<ref>{{cite web|title=The Science Of Color Enhances Carpet Style|url=http://www.carpet-rug.org/Carpet-for-Business/Specifying-the-Right-Carpet/Dyeing-and-Color-Selection.aspx|website=carpet-rug.org|accessdate=28 October 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151019002910/http://www.carpet-rug.org/Carpet-for-Business/Specifying-the-Right-Carpet/Dyeing-and-Color-Selection.aspx|archive-date=2015-10-19|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nUnlike woven carpets, '''[[embroidery]] carpets'''' are not formed on a loom. Their pattern is established by the application of [[stitch (textile arts)|stitches]] to a [[cloth]] (often [[linen]]) base. The tent stitch and the cross stitch are two of the most common. Embroidered carpets were traditionally made by royal and aristocratic women in the home, but there has been some commercial manufacture since steel needles were introduced (earlier needles were made of bone) and linen weaving improved in the 16th century. [[Mary, Queen of Scots]], is known to have been an avid embroiderer. 16th century designs usually involve scrolling vines and regional flowers (for example, the [[Bradford carpet]]). They often incorporate animal heraldry and the [[coat of arms]] of the maker. Production continued through the 19th century. [[Victorian era|Victorian]] embroidered carpet compositions include highly illusionistic, 3-dimensional flowers. Patterns for tiled carpets made of a number of squares, called [[Berlin wool work]], were introduced in [[Germany]] in 1804, and became extremely popular in England in the 1830s. Embroidered carpets can also include other features such as a pattern of shapes, or they can even tell a story.\n\n==Fibres and yarns==\n[[File:Stamp of Moldova 138.jpg|thumb|A [[Moldova]]n [[Postage stamp|stamp]] featuring a carpet]]\nCarpet can be formulated from many single or blended [[nature|natural]] and [[synthetic fibre]]s. Fibres are chosen for durability, appearance, ease of manufacture, and cost. In terms of scale of production, the dominant yarn constructions are polyamides (nylons) and polypropylene with an estimated 90% of the commercial market.<ref>Gudrun Heisterberg-Moutsis, Rainer Heinz, Thomas F. Wolf, Dominic J. Harper, David James, Richard P. Mazzur, Volker Kettler, Hansgert Soin\u00e9 \"Floor Coverings\" Ullmann's Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry 2002, Wiley-VCH, Weinheim. {{DOI|10.1002/14356007.a11_263}}</ref>\n\n===Nylon===\nSince the 20th century, [[nylon]] is one of the most common materials for the construction of carpets. Both [[nylon 6]] and [[nylon 6-6]] are used. Nylon can be dyed topically or dyed in a molten state (solution dying). Nylon can be printed easily and has excellent wear characteristics. Due to nylon's excellent wear-resistance, it is widely used in industrial and commercial carpeting. In carpets, nylon tends to stain easily because of the dye sites which exist on the fibre. These dye sites need to be filled in order to give nylon carpet any type of stain resistance. As nylon is petroleum-based it varies in price with the price of oil.\n\n===Polypropylene===\n[[Polypropylene]], a [[polyolefin]] stiffer than the cheaper [[polyethylene]], is used to produce carpet yarns because it is still less expensive than the other materials used for carpets. It is difficult to dye and does not wear as well as wool or nylon. Polypropylene, sometimes referred to simply as \"olefin\", is commonly used to construct berber carpets. Large looped olefin berber carpets are usually only suited for light domestic use and tend to mat down quickly. Berber carpets with smaller loops tend to be more resilient and retain their new appearance longer than large looped berber styles. Commercial grade level-loop carpets have very small loops, and commercial grade cut-pile styles can be well constructed. When made with polypropylene, commercial grade styles wear very well, making them very suitable for areas with heavy foot traffic such as offices. Polypropylene carpets are known to have good stain resistance, but not against oil- based agents. If a stain does set, it can be difficult to clean. Commercial grade carpets can be glued directly to the floor or installed over a 1/4\" thick, 8-pound density padding. Outdoor grass carpets are usually made from polypropylene.\n\n===Wool and wool-blends===\n[[File:2012-10-02 Wurstteppich huchwasistdenndas anagoria.jpg|thumb|A wool carpet]]\n[[Wool]] has excellent durability, can be dyed easily and is fairly abundant. When blended with synthetic fibres such as nylon the durability of wool is increased. Blended wool yarns are extensively used in production of modern carpet, with the most common blend being 80% wool to 20% synthetic fibre, giving rise to the term \"80/20\". Wool is relatively expensive and consequently it only comprises a small portion of the market.\n\n===Polyester===\nThe [[polyester]] known as \"PET\" ([[polyethylene terephthalate]]) is used in carpet manufacturing in both spun and filament constructions. After the price of raw materials for many types of carpet rose in the early 2000s, polyester became more competitive. Polyester has good physical properties and is inherently stain-resistant because it is hydrophobic, and, unlike nylon, does not have dye sites. Colour is infused in a molten state (solution dyeing). Polyester has the disadvantage that it tends to crush or mat down easily. It is typically used in mid- to low-priced carpeting.\n\nAnother polyester, \"PTT\" ([[Polytrimethylene terephthalate]]), also called Sorona or 3GT (Dupont) or Corterra (Shell), is a variant of PET. Lurgi Zimmer PTT was first patented in 1941, but it was not produced until the 1990s, when Shell Chemicals developed the low-cost method of producing high-quality 1,3 propanediol (PDO), the starting raw material for PTT Corterra Polymers. DuPont subsequently commercialized a [[biological process]] for making [[1,3-propanediol]] from [[corn syrup]], imparting significant [[Renewable resource|renewable]] content on the corresponding Sorona polyester carpet fibers.<ref name=Sengupta>{{cite book|last1=Sengupta|first1=Debolina|last2=Pike|first2=Ralph W.|title=Chemicals from Biomass: Ingegrating Bioprocess into Chemical Production|date=July 5, 2012|publisher=CRC Press|isbn=978-1439878149|page=95|url=https://books.google.com/?id=Z9N_xWEGI9wC&pg=PA95&lpg=PA95&dq=1,3-propanediol+production+tennessee#v=onepage&q=1%2C3-propanediol%20production%20tennessee&f=false|accessdate=27 January 2015}}</ref> These carpet fibers have resiliency comparable to nylon.<ref name=Chuah>{{cite book|last1=Chuah|first1=Hoe H.|title=Poly(trimethylene terephthalate)|journal=Encyclopedia of Polymer Science and Technology|date=22 October 2001|doi=10.1002/0471440264.pst292|isbn=978-0471440260}}</ref>\n\n===Acrylic===\n[[Acrylic fiber|Acrylic]] is a synthetic material first created by the Dupont Corporation in 1941 but has gone through various changes since it was first introduced. In the past, acrylic carpet used to fuzz or \"pill\" easily. This happened when the fibres degraded over time and short strands broke away with contact or friction. Over the years, new types of acrylics have been developed to alleviate some of these problems, although the issues have not been completely removed. Acrylic is fairly difficult to dye but is colourfast, washable, and has the feel and appearance of wool, making it a good rug fabric.\n\n==History==\n[[File: Pazyryk carpet.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Pazyryk burials#Pazyryk carpet|Pazyryk]] Carpet, the oldest surviving carpet in the world ([[Armenia]] or [[Iran|Persia]], 5th century BC)]]\n[[File:The Czartoryski Carpet.jpg|thumb|upright|The [[Czartoryski]] carpet with coat of arms of the Polish Myszkowski family,<ref name=polish /> made with a [[cotton]] warp, a [[silk]] weft and pile, and metal wrapped thread (Iran, 17th century)]]\nThe knotted pile carpet probably originated in the [[Caspian Sea]] area (Northern Iran) <ref>E.J.W.

Famous Afghan rugs include the ''[[Shindand, Herat|Shindand]]'' or ''[[Adraskan]]'' (named after local Afghan villages), woven in the [[Herat Province|Herat]] area in western Afghanistan.\n\nAfghan carpets are commonly known as Afghan rugs. Afghan carpets are a unique and well recognized handmade material design that originates from Afghanistan. They often exhibit intricate detailing, mainly using traditional tribal designs originating from the Turkmen, Kazakh, Baloch, and Uzbeks. The hand-made rugs come in many patterns and colors, yet the traditional and most common example of Afghan carpet is the octagon-shaped elephant-foot (Bukhara). The rugs with this print are most commonly red in color. Many dyes, such as [[vegetable dye]]s, are used to impart rich color.\n\n===Armenia===\n{{main|Armenian carpet}}\n\nThe historian Herodotus writing in the 5th century BC also informs us that the inhabitants of the Caucasus wove beautiful rugs with brilliant colors which would never fade.[23] Various rug fragments have been excavated in Armenia dating back to the 7th century BC or earlier.

China has a long history of exporting traditional goods; however, it was not until the first half of the 19th century that the Chinese began to export their rugs. Once in contact with western influences, there was a large change in production: Chinese manufactories began to produce [[art-deco]] rugs with [[commerce|commercial]] look and price point. The centuries-old Chinese textile industry is rich in history. While most antique carpets are classified according to a specific region or manufactory, scholars attribute the age of any specific Chinese rug to the ruling emperor of the time. The earliest surviving examples of the craft were produced during the time of [[Ch'ung Chen]], the last emperor of the [[Chen Dynasty]].\n\n===India===\n\nCarpet weaving may have been introduced into the area as far back as the eleventh century with the coming of the first Muslim conquerors, the [[Ghaznavids]] and the [[Ghauris]], from the West. It can with more certainty be traced to the beginning of the Mughal Dynasty in the early sixteenth century, when the last successor of Timur, Babar, extended his rule from Kabul to India to found the Mughal Empire. Under the patronage of the Mughals, Indian craftsmen adopted Persian techniques and designs. Carpets woven in the Punjab made use of motifs and decorative styles found in Mughal architecture.\n\n[[Akbar]], a Mogul emperor, is accredited to introducing the art of carpet weaving to India during his reign. The Mughal emperors patronized Persian carpets for their royal courts and palaces. During this period, he brought Persian craftsmen from their homeland and established them in India. Initially, the carpets woven showed the classic Persian style of fine knotting. Gradually it blended with Indian art. Thus the carpets produced became typical of the Indian origin and gradually the industry began to diversify and spread all over the subcontinent. During the Mughal period, the carpets made on the Indian subcontinent became so famous that demand for them spread abroad. These carpets had distinctive designs and boasted a high density of knots. Carpets made for the Mughal emperors, including Jahangir and Shah Jahan, were of the finest quality. Under Shah Jahan's reign, Mughal carpet weaving took on a new aesthetic and entered its classical phase.{{citation needed|date=April 2012}} Indian carpets are well known for their designs with attention to detail and presentation of realistic attributes. The carpet industry in India flourished more in its northern part with major centres found in Kashmir, Jaipur, [[Agra]] and Bhadohi.\n\nIndian carpets are known for their high density of knotting.

Excavations at [[Harappa]] and [[Mohenjo-Daro]]\u2013 ancient cities of the [[Indus Valley Civilization]]\u2013 have established that the inhabitants used spindles and spun a wide variety of weaving materials. Some historians consider that the Indus Valley civilization first developed the use of woven textiles. As of the late 1990s, hand-knotted carpets were among Pakistan's leading export products and their manufacture is the second largest cottage and small industry.

Turkish pile rugs and kilims are also frequently used as tent decorations, grain bags, camel and donkey bags, ground cushions, oven covers, sofa covers, bed and cushion covers, blankets, curtains, eating blankets, table top spreads, prayer rugs and for ceremonial occasions.\n\nThe oldest records of flat woven kilims come from [[\u00c7atalh\u00f6y\u00fck]] Neolithic pottery, circa 7000 B.C.

Until the mid-18th century they were mostly used on walls and tables. Except in royal or ecclesiastical settings they were considered too precious to cover the floor. Starting in the 13th century oriental carpets begin to appear in paintings (notably from Italy, Flanders, England, France, and the Netherlands). Carpets of Indo-Persian design were introduced to Europe via the Dutch, British, and French [[East India Company|East India Companies]] of the 17th and 18th century<ref>Dimand, Maurice Sven and Jean Mailey.

Documentary evidence shows production beginning in Spain as early as the 10th century AD. The earliest extant Spanish carpet, the so-called Synagogue carpet in the Museum of Islamic Art, Berlin, is a unique survival dated to the 14th century. The earliest group of Hispano-Moresque carpets, Admiral carpets (also known as armorial carpets), has an all-over geometric, repeat pattern punctuated by blazons of noble, Christian Spanish families. The variety of this design was analyzed most thoroughly by [[May Beattie]]. Many of the 15th-century, Spanish carpets rely heavily on designs originally developed on the Anatolian Peninsula.{{Citation needed|date=December 2019}} Carpet production continued after the Reconquest of Spain and eventual expulsion of the Muslim population in the 15th century. 16th-century Renaissance Spanish carpet design is a derivative of silk textile design. Some of the most popular motifs are [[wreath]]s, [[Acanthus (ornament)|acanthus leaves]] and [[pomegranates]].\n\nDuring the [[Moorish]] (Muslim) period production took place in [[Alcaraz]] in the province of Murcia, as well as being recorded in other towns. Carpet production after the Christian reconquest continued in Alcaraz while [[Cuenca, Spain|Cuenca]], first recorded as a weaving centre in the 12th century, became increasingly important, and was dominant in the 17th and early 18th century. Carpets of completely different French based designs began to be woven in a royal workshop, the [[Royal Tapestry Factory]] ''(Real F\u00e1brica de Tapices de Santa B\u00e1rbara)'' in Madrid in the 18th century. Cuenca was closed down by the royal degree of Carlos IV in the late 18th century to stop it competing with the new workshop. Madrid continued as a weaving centre through to the 20th century, producing brightly coloured carpets most of whose designs are strongly influenced by French carpet design, and which are frequently signed (on occasions with the monogram MD; also sometimes with the name Stuyck) and dated in the outer stripe. After the [[Spanish civil war]] [[General Franco]] revived the carpet weaving industry in workshops named after him, weaving designs that are influenced by earlier Spanish carpets, usually in a very limited range of colours.<ref name=\"Sherrill, Sarah B 1996\">Sherrill, Sarah B.

Pirot kilims with some 122 ornaments and 96 different types have been protected by geographical indication in 2002. They are one of the most important traditional handicrafts in Serbia. In the late 19th century and up to the Second World War, Pirot kilims have been frequently used as insignia of Serbian and Yugoslav royalty. This tradition was revived in 2011 when Pirot kilims were reintroduced for state ceremonies in Serbia. Carpet weaving in Pirot dates back to the Middle Ages.<ref>LEPOTA TRAJANJA</ref>{{full citation needed|date=December 2018}} One of the first mentions of the Pirot kilim in written sources date to 1565, when it was said that the \u0161ajka\u0161i boats on the Danube and Drava were covered with Pirot kilims. Pirot was once the most important rug-making centre in the Balkans. Pirot is located on the historical main highway which linked central Europe with Constantinople.Pirot was also known as \u015eark\u00f6y in Turkish. The Pirot carpet varieties are also found in Bulgaria and Turkey, and in many other international collections. One of the chief qualities are the colour effects achieved through the choice and arrangement of colours.\n\nIn the beginning of the 19th century plant dyes were replaced by aniline colourings. \"The best product of the country is the Pirot carpet, worth about ten shillings a square metre. The designs are extremely pretty, and the rugs, without being so heavy as the Persian, or so ragged and scant in the web and weft as Caramanian, wear for ever. The manufacture of these is almost entirely confined to Pirot. From Pirots old Turkish signification as \u015eark\u00f6y stems the traditional trade name of the rugs as \u015eark\u00f6y-kilims. Stemming from the homonym to the today's Turkish settlement of \u015eark\u00f6y in Thracia, which had no established rug making tradition, \u015eark\u00f6ys are often falsely ascribed to originate from Turkey. Also in the rug selling industry, \u015eark\u00f6y are mostly labeled as being of oriental or Turkish origin as to easier sell them to non familiar customers as they prefer rug with putative oriental origin. In fact, \u015eark\u00f6ys have been established from the 17th century in the region of the Western Balkan or Stara Planina mountains in the towns of Pirot, Berkowiza, Lom, Chiprovtsi and Samokow. Later they have been also produced in Knja\u017eevac and Caribrod.\n\n===Bulgaria===\n{{main |Chiprovtsi carpet}}\nThe [[Chiprovtsi carpet]] (\u0427\u0438\u043f\u0440\u043e\u0432\u0446\u0438 \u043a\u0438\u043b\u0438\u043c) is a type of handmade carpet with two absolutely identical sides, part of Bulgarian national heritage, traditions, arts and crafts. Its name is derived from the town of [[Chiprovtsi]] where their production started in the 17th century. The carpet weaving industry played a key role in the revival of Chiprovtsi in the 1720s after the devastation of the failed 1688 [[Chiprovtsi Uprising]] against Ottoman rule. The western traveller [[Ami Bou\u00e9]], who visited Chiprovtsi in 1836\u20131838, reported that \"mainly young girls, under shelters or in corridors, engage in carpet weaving.

This production was soon moved to the Savonnerie factory in Chaillot just west of Paris. The earliest, well-known group produced by the Savonnerie, then under the direction of [[Simon Lourdet]], are the carpets that were produced in the early years of [[Louis XIV of France|Louis XIV]]'s reign. They are densely ornamented with flowers, sometimes in vases or baskets, against dark blue or brown grounds in deep borders. The designs are based on Netherlandish and Flemish textiles and paintings. The most famous Savonnerie carpets are the series made for the Grande Galerie and the Galerie d'Apollon in the [[Palais du Louvre]] between c. 1665-1685. These 105 masterpieces, made under the artistic direction of [[Charles Le Brun]], were never installed, as Louis XIV moved the court to [[Palace of Versailles|Versailles]] in 1688. Their design combines rich [[Acanthus (ornament)|acanthus]] leaves, architectural framing, and mythological scenes (inspired by [[Cesare Ripa]]'s Iconologie) with emblems of Louis XIV's royal power.\n\n{{Q|Q28017591|Pierre-Josse Joseph Perrot}} is the best-known of the mid-eighteenth-century carpet designers. His many surviving works and drawings display graceful rococo s-scrolls, central rosettes, shells, acanthus leaves, and floral swags.

Carpet production in small, privately owned workshops in the town of [[Aubusson, Creuse|Aubusson]] began in 1743. Carpets produced in France employ the symmetrical knot.<ref name=\"Sherrill, Sarah B 1996\"/>\n\n===England===\nKnotted pile carpet weaving technology probably came to England in the early 16th century with [[Flemings|Flemish]] [[Calvinist]]s fleeing religious persecution. Because many of these weavers settled in South-eastern [[England]] in Norwich the 14 extant 16th and 17th century carpets are sometimes referred to as \"Norwich carpets.\" These works are either adaptations of Anatolian or Indo-Persian designs or employ Elizabethan-Jacobean scrolling vines and blossoms. All but one are dated or bear a coat of arms. Like the French, English weavers used the symmetrical knot. There are documented and surviving examples of carpets from three 18th-century manufactories: Exeter (1756\u20131761, owned by [[Claude Passavant]], 3 extant carpets), Moorfields (1752\u20131806, owned by Thomas Moore, 5 extant carpets), and Axminster (1755\u20131835, owned by [[Thomas Whitty]], numerous extant carpets). Exeter and Moorfields were both staffed with renegade weavers from the French Savonnerie and, therefore, employ the weaving structure of that factory and Perrot-inspired designs. Neoclassical designer [[Robert Adam]] supplied designs for both Moorfields and Axminster carpets based on [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] floor [[mosaics]] and coffered ceilings. Some of the most well-known rugs of his design were made for [[Syon House]], [[Osterley House]], [[Harewood House]], [[Saltram House]], and [[Newby Hall]].\n\n{{visible anchor|Axminster carpet}} was a unique floor covering made originally in a [[Axminster Carpets|factory]] founded at Axminster, Devon, England, in 1755 by the cloth weaver [[Thomas Whitty]]. Resembling somewhat the Savonnerie carpets produced in France, Axminster carpets were symmetrically knotted by hand in wool on woolen warps and had a weft of flax or hemp. Like the French carpets, they often featured Renaissance architectural or floral patterns; others mimicked oriental patterns. Similar carpets were produced at the same time in Exeter and in the Moorfields section of London and, shortly before, at Fulham in Middlesex. The Whitty factory closed in 1835 with the advent of machine-made carpeting. The name Axminster, however, survived as a generic term for machine-made carpets whose pile is produced by techniques similar to those used in making velvet or chenille.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/46332/Axminster-carpet |title=Axminster carpet - Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica |publisher=Britannica.com |date= |accessdate=2013-10-04}}</ref>\n\nAxminster carpet has three main types of broadloom carpet construction in use today (machine woven, tufted & hand knotted). Machine woven carpet is an investment that will last 20 or 30 years and woven Axminster and Wilton carpets are still extremely popular in areas where longevity and design flexibility are a big part of the purchasing decision. Hotels and leisure venues almost always choose these types and many homes use woven Axminsters as design statements.\n\n[[File:Rug.jpg|thumb|Machine used to cut and re-roll carpet lengths]]\nMachine-woven carpets like Axminster and Wilton are made by massive looms that weave together \u2018bobbins\u2019 of carpet yarn and backing. The finished result, which can be intricately patterned, creates a floor that provides supreme underfoot luxury with high performance. Tufted carpets are also popular in the home. They are relatively speedy to make - a pre-woven backing has yarns tufted into it. Needles push the yarn through the backing and which is then held in place with underlying \"loopers\". Tufted carpets can be twist pile, velvet, or loop pile. Twist pile carpets are produced when one or more fibres are twisted in the tufting process, so that in the finished carpet they appear to be bound together. Velvet pile carpets tend to have a shorter pile and a tighter construction, giving the finished article a smooth, velvety appearance. Loop pile carpets are renowned for being hard wearing and lend carpets great texture. The traditional domain of rugs from far away continents, hand knotted squares and rugs use the expertise of weavers to produce work of the finest quality. Traditional rugs often feature a deliberate \u2018mistake\u2019 on behalf of the weaver to guarantee their authenticity.\n\nSix of Axminster carpets are known as the \"Lansdowne\" group. These have a tripartite design with reeded circles and baskets of flowers in the central panel flanked by diamond lozenges in the side panels. Axminster Rococo designs often have a brown ground and include birds copied from popular, contemporary engravings. Even now a large percentage of the 55,000 population town still seek employment in this industry. The town of [[Wilton, Wiltshire]] is also known for its carpet weaving, which dates back to the 18th century.<ref>{{cite book|title=Interior Decoration: A Complete Source|url=https://books.google.com/?id=_btgLVQUVL0C&dq=lansdowne+group+axminster+carpets|accessdate=2011-11-14|isbn=9788189940652|last1=Morris|first1=Shirley|date=2007-06-28}}</ref>\n\nThe Brussels Loom was introduced into England towards the middle of the eighteenth century marked the beginning of a new era in carpet-weaving. It was the first loom on which a pile carpet could be woven mechanically, the pile consisting of rows of loops, formed over wires inserted weftwise during weaving and subsequently withdrawn. Brussels was the first type of carpet to be woven in a loom incorporating the jacquard pattern selecting mechanism and in 1849 power was applied to the loom by Biglow in the U.S.A.\n\nLater when bladed wires were developed the pile loops were severed on withdrawal of the blade wires to produce a carpet known as Wilton, after this development the loom became known as the Wilton loom, and in modern usage the designation Wilton applies to both cut-pile and loop-pile carpets made in this loom. The latter now variously described as Brussels-Wilton, round wire Wilton, loop-pile Wilton, and round wired jacquard. The methods of manufacture, including the principles of designing, preparatory processes, and weaving, are the same in most respects for both Brussels and Wilton qualities. The chief difference between them is that whereas Brussels loop-pile is secured satisfactorily by the insertion of two picks of weft to each wire (2-shot), the Wilton cut-pile is woven more often with three picks of weft to each wire (3-shot) to ensure that the tufts are firmly secured in the carpet backing.\n\nBrussels carpets have a smooth slightly ribbed surface and their patterning is well defined, a characteristic feature of the carpet. Closeness of pile rather than height contributes to their neat appearance and hard wearing properties, although they do not simulate the luxury of cut-pile carpets. Brussels Wilton Carpets were initially produced on 27-inch (3/4) looms and were sewn together by hand. The looms could incorporate up to 5 frames all with different colours thus enabling figured or pattern carpets to be manufactured. With judicial and very skilful planting of colours in the frames the number of colours could be increased to about twenty, thus enabling very complex designs to be produced. Due to the additional costs in labour these carpets were normally only produced for the bespoke market.\n\nAfter the first World War the carpets started to be produced for the general market using popular designs and colourways but they always remained at the luxury end of the general market. The growing middle class of the twentieth century aspired to acquire a Wilton carpet for their 'best' room. Despite the impact of industrialization, the areas where Brussels Wilton carpets were produced remained centred mainly in the Midlands around the towns of Wilton and Kidderminster and in West Yorkshire where the firm of John Crossley and Sons in Halifax became synonymous with carpet manufacture. There were smaller areas of manufacture in Scotland and Durham. With the development of different manufacturing methods and looms capable of the mass production of carpets, the public began change their d\u00e9cor, including carpets, on a regular basis, which increased the demand for carpets. The last quarter of the 20th century saw the rapid decline of the labour-intensive Brussels Wilton carpets. Very few of the original \u00be Wilton looms still exist and the few that do are either in museums or used by small manufacturers that continue to produce custom made luxury carpets for the elite and to replace carpets in historic buildings in the UK and abroad.<ref>''Carpets'' by George Robinson F.T.I., F.S.D.C. published 1966 Chap 7 Wilton Carpets page 72.</ref>\n\n==Modern carpeting and installation==\n[[File:Berber Carpet (macro).jpg|thumb|[[Macro photography|Macro]] shot of a [[Berber carpet|Berber-style carpet]]. Berber-style carpets feature two sizes of tufts of varying colors in a loop pile construction]]\nCarpet is commonly made in widths of {{convert|12|ft|m}} and {{convert|15|ft|m}} in the US, 4&nbsp;m and 5&nbsp;m in Europe. Where necessary different widths can be seamed together with a seaming iron and seam tape (formerly it was [[sewing|sewn]] together) and it is fixed to a floor over a cushioned [[underlay]] (pad) using nails, [[tack strip]]s (known in the UK as gripper rods), adhesives, or occasionally decorative metal [[stair rod]]s, thus distinguishing it from rugs or [[mat]]s, which are loose-laid floor coverings. For environmental reasons, the use of wool, natural bindings, natural padding, and formaldehyde-free glues is becoming more common. These options are almost always at a premium cost.\n\nIn the UK, some carpets are still manufactured for yachts, hotels, pubs and clubs in a narrow width of {{convert|27|in|m}} and then sewn to size. Carpeting which covers an entire room area is loosely referred to as 'wall-to-wall', but carpet can be installed over any portion thereof with use of appropriate transition moldings where the carpet meets other types of floor coverings. Carpeting is more than just a single item; it is, in fact, a system comprising the carpet itself, the carpet backing (often made of latex), the cushioning underlay, and a method of installation.\nCarpet tiles are also available, typically {{convert|50|cm|in}} square. These are usually only used in commercial settings and are affixed using a special pressure-sensitive glue, which holds them into place while allowing easy removal (in an office environment, for example) or to allow rearrangement in order to spread wear.<ref>Fletcher, Alan J. The Complete Carpet Buying Guide. Portland Oregon: AJ Books 2006.</ref>\n\n\"Carpet binding\" is a term used for any material being applied to the edge of a carpet to make a rug. Carpet binding is usually cotton or nylon, but also comes in many other materials such as leather. Non-synthetic binding is frequently used with bamboo, grass and wool rugs, but is often used with carpet made from other materials.\n\n==In culture and figurative expressions==\n[[File:Vasnetsov samolet.jpg|thumb|A mythical [[magic carpet]]]]\nThere are many stories about [[magic carpet]]s, legendary flying carpets that can be used to transport people who are on it instantaneously or quickly to their destination. Disney's Aladdin depicts a magic carpet found by Aladdin and Abu in the Cave of Wonders while trying to find Genie's lamp. Aladdin and Jasmine ride on him to go on a ride around the world. The term \"[m]agic carpet [is] first attested [in] 1816.<ref name=\"etymonline1\"/> From the 16th century to the 19th century, the term \"carpet\" was used \"...as an adjective often with a tinge of contempt, when used of men (as in carpet-knight, 1570s)\", which meant a man who was associated with \"...luxury, ladies' boudoirs, and drawing rooms\".<ref name=\"etymonline1\"/> ''Rolling out the red carpet'' is an expression which means to welcome a guest lavishly and handsomely. In some cases, an actual [[red carpet]] is used for VIPs and celebrities to walk on, such as at the [[Cannes Film Festival]] and when foreign dignitaries are welcomed to a country.\n\nIn 1820s British servant slang, to \"carpet\" someone means to call them for a reprimand.<ref name=\"etymonline1\" /> To be ''called on the carpet'' means to be summoned for a serious reason, typically a scolding reprimand; this usage dates from 1900.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.etymonline.com/search?q=carpet.|title=carpet. - Search Online Etymology Dictionary|website=www.etymonline.com}}</ref> A stronger variant of this expression, to be \"hauled on the carpet\", implies an even sterner reprimand. [[Carpet bombing]] is a type of bombing from airplanes which developed in the 20th century in which an entire city is bombed (rather than precise strikes on military targets). The slang expression \"laugh at the carpet\" means to [[vomit]] on the floor (especially a carpeted floor).<ref name=autogenerated2>{{cite web|url=http://idioms.thefreedictionary.com/carpet|title=carpet|publisher=|via=The Free Dictionary}}</ref> The expression \"on the carpet\" refers to a matter which is under discussion or consideration.<ref name=autogenerated2 /> The term \"carpet muncher\" is a derogatory slang term for a [[lesbian]]; this expression is first attested in 1992.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.dictionary.com/browse/carpet-muncher |title=Carpet muncher |website=Dictionary.com<!-- Bot generated title --> |access-date=2018-12-28 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160728191015/http://www.dictionary.com/browse/carpet-muncher |archive-date=2016-07-28 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n[[File:The_Carpet_Seller,_a_figurine_by_Royal_Doulton.jpg|thumb|left|''The Carpet Seller'', a [[Royal Doulton]] figurine]]\nThe term [[carpet bag]], which literally refers to a suitcase made from a piece of carpet, is used in several figurative contexts. The term gained a popular usage after the [[American Civil War]] to refer to [[carpetbaggers]], Northerners who moved to the South after the war, especially during the [[Reconstruction Era of the United States|Reconstruction era]] (1865\u20131877). Carpetbaggers allegedly politically manipulated and controlled former Confederate states for financial and power gains. In modern usage in the U.S., the term is sometimes used derisively to refer to a politician who runs for public office in an area where he or she does not have deep community ties, or has lived only for a short time. In the United Kingdom, the term was adopted to refer informally to those who join a [[mutual organization]], such as a [[building society]], in order to force it to [[Demutualization|demutualize]], that is, to convert into a [[joint stock company]], solely for personal financial gain.\n\n''Cutting the rug'' is a slang term for dancing which originated in 1942.<ref name=\"etymonline2\" /> The use of the term \"rug\" as an informal term for a \"[[toupee]]\" (man's [[wig]]) is [[theater]] slang from 1940.<ref name=\"etymonline2\" /> The term \"sweep [something] under the rug\" or \"sweep [something] under the carpet\" figuratively refers to situations where a person or organization is hiding something embarrassing or negative; this use was first recorded in 1953.<ref name=\"etymonline1\"/> The figurative expression \"pull the rug out from under (someone)\", meaning to \"suddenly deprive of important support\" is first attested to in 1936, in American English. A related figurative expression used centuries earlier was \"cut the grass under (one's) feet\", which is attested to in the 1580s.<ref name=\"etymonline2\" /> A \"rugrat\" or \"rug-rat\" is a slang term for a baby or child, first attested in 1968.<ref name=\"etymonline2\" /> The expression \"snug as a bug in a rug\" means\n\"wrapped up tight, warm, and comfortable\".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://idioms.thefreedictionary.com/snug+as+a+bug+in+a+rug|title=snug as a bug in a rug|website=TheFreeDictionary.com}}</ref> To \"lie like a rug\" means \"to tell lies shamelessly\".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://idioms.thefreedictionary.com/lie+like+a+rug|title=lie like a rug|website=TheFreeDictionary.com}}</ref> The expression \"pull the rug out (from under someone)\" means \"to make someone or someone's plans fall through\" or \"to upset someone's plans\".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://idioms.thefreedictionary.com/pull+the+rug+out|title=pull the rug out|website=TheFreeDictionary.com}}</ref>\n{{clearleft}}\n==See also==\n* [[Floor cleaning]]\n* [[Heatsetting]]\n* [[William Morris]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|colwidth=30em|refs=\n\n<ref name=polish>{{cite web|author=Marcin Latka|title=Polish carpets|url=https://artinpoland.weebly.com/en/polish-carpets|accessdate=2 October 2018|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20181002064840/https://artinpoland.weebly.com/en/polish-carpets#|archivedate=2018-10-02}}</ref>\n}}\n\n==Further reading==\n{{Sister project links| wikt=carpet | commons=Category:Rugs and carpets | b=no | n=no | q=Carpet | s=no | v=no | voy=Carpets | species=no | d=no}}\n*{{cite book |author=Walker, Daniel| title= ''Flowers underfoot : Indian carpets of the Mughal era'' | location=New York | publisher=The Metropolitan Museum of Art | year=1997| url= http://libmma.contentdm.oclc.org/cdm/ref/collection/p15324coll10/id/73761}}\n\n<!--======================== {{No more links}} ============================\n    | PLEASE BE CAUTIOUS IN ADDING MORE LINKS TO THIS ARTICLE.

The pile was traditionally made from wool, but since the 20th century, synthetic fibers such as [[polypropylene]], [[nylon]] or [[polyester]] are often used, as these fibers are less expensive than wool. The pile usually consists of twisted tufts that are typically heat-treated to maintain their structure. The term ''carpet'' is often used interchangeably with the term ''rug'', although rugs are typically considered to be smaller than a room and not attached to the floor.\n\nCarpets are used for a variety of purposes, including insulating a person's feet from a cold tile or concrete floor, making a room more comfortable as a place to sit on the floor (e.g., when playing with children or as a [[prayer rug]]), reducing sound from walking (particularly in [[apartment buildings]]), and adding decoration or colour to a room. Carpets can be made in any colour by using differently dyed fibers. Carpets can have many different types of patterns and motifs used to decorate the surface. Carpets are used in industrial and commercial establishments such as retail stores and [[hotel]]s and in private homes. Today, a huge range of carpets and rugs are available at many price and quality levels, ranging from inexpensive, synthetic carpets that are [[mass production|mass-produced]] in [[factory|factories]] and used in commercial buildings to costly hand-knotted wool rugs that are used in private homes of wealthy families.\n\nCarpets can be produced on a [[loom]] quite similar to [[woven fabric]], made using needle [[felt]]s, knotted by hand (in [[oriental rug]]s), made with their pile injected into a backing material (called tufting), flatwoven, made by hooking wool or cotton through the meshes of a sturdy fabric, or [[embroidery|embroidered]]. Carpet is commonly made in widths of {{convert|12|ft|m}} and {{convert|15|ft|m}} in the US and {{Convert|4|m|abbr=on}} and {{Convert|5|m|abbr=on}} in Europe. Since the 19th and 20th century, where necessary for wall-to-wall carpet, different widths of carpet can be seamed together with a seaming iron and seam tape (formerly it was [[sewing|sewn]] together) and fixed to a floor over a cushioned [[underlay]] (pad) using nails, [[tack strip]]s (known in the UK as gripper rods), adhesives, or occasionally decorative metal [[stair rod]]s. Wall-to-wall carpet is distinguished from rugs or [[mat]]s, which are loose-laid floor coverings, as wall-to-wall carpet is fixed to the floor and covers a much larger area.\n\nThe [[GoodWeave]] labelling scheme used throughout [[Europe]] and [[North America]] assures that child labour has not been used: importers pay for the labels, and the revenue collected is used to monitor centres of production and educate previously exploited children.<ref name=\"autogenerated1\">{{cite web|url=http://www.GoodWeave.org/index.php?cid=13 |title=About the GoodWeave label |publisher=Goodweave.org |date= |accessdate=2012-01-26}}</ref>\n\n==Etymology and usage==\n[[File:A carpet seller in Jaipur.jpg|thumb|right|upright|A carpet seller in [[Jaipur]], India]]\nThe term ''[[wikt:carpet|carpet]]'' comes from [[Old French]] ''carpite''.

Some sources define a carpet as stretching from wall to wall.<ref>How It's Made, Season 2, Episode 7</ref> Another definition treats rugs as of lower quality or of smaller size, with carpets quite often having finished ends. A third common definition is that a carpet is permanently fixed in place while a rug is simply laid out on the floor. Historically, the term \"carpet\" was also applied to table and wall coverings, as carpets were not commonly used on the floor in European interiors until the 15th century.\n\nThe term \"rug\" was first used in English in the 1550s, with the meaning \"coarse fabric\". The term is of \"...Scandinavian origin; compare Norwegian dialectal rugga \"coarse coverlet,\" from [[Old Norse]] rogg \"shaggy tuft,\" from Proto-Germanic *rawwa-, perhaps related to rag (n.) and rough (adj.).\"<ref name=\"etymonline2\">{{cite web|url=https://www.etymonline.com/search?q=rug|title=rug - Search Online Etymology Dictionary|website=www.etymonline.com}}</ref> The meaning of \"rug\" \"...evolved to \"coverlet, wrap\" (1590s), then \"mat for the floor\" (1808)\".<ref name=\"etymonline2\"/>\n\n==Types==\n[[File:Moden carpet illustrating camel caravan on Silk Road. Kashgar.jpg|thumb|left|Modern carpet illustrating a camel caravan on the [[Silk Road]]]]\n\n===Woven===\nThe carpet is produced on a [[loom]] quite similar to [[woven fabric]]. The pile can be [[plush]] or [[Berber carpet|Berber]]. Plush carpet is a cut [[Pile (textile)|pile]] and Berber carpet is a loop pile. There are new styles of carpet combining the two styles called cut and loop carpeting. Normally many colored yarns are used and this process is capable of producing intricate patterns from predetermined designs (although some limitations apply to certain weaving methods with regard to accuracy of pattern within the carpet). These carpets are usually the most expensive due to the relatively slow speed of the manufacturing process. These are very famous in Iran, India, Pakistan, and Arabia.\n\n===Needle felt===\n[[File:Toranj - special circular design of Iranian carpets.JPG|thumbnail|A [[Persian carpet#Field design - medallions and borders|''toranj'' medallion]], a common design in [[Persian carpets]]]]\nThese carpets are more technologically advanced. Needle [[felt]]s are produced by intermingling and felting individual [[synthetic fiber]]s using barbed and forked needles forming an extremely durable carpet. These carpets are normally found in commercial settings such as hotels and restaurants where there is frequent traffic.\n\n===Knotted===\n{{main|Knotted-pile carpet}}\n[[File:Carpet in Preparation on a Carpet Loom.jpg|thumb|A traditional rug being woven on a carpet [[loom]]]]\nOn a '''knotted pile''' carpet (formally, a \"supplementary weft cut-loop pile\" carpet), the structural [[weft]] threads alternate with a supplementary weft that rises at right angles to the surface of the weave. This supplementary weft is attached to the [[Warp (weaving)|warp]] by one of three knot types (see below), such as [[shag carpet]] which was popular in the 1970s, to form the pile or [[nap (textile)|nap]] of the carpet. Knotting by hand is most prevalent in [[oriental rug]]s and carpets. Kashmir carpets are also hand-knotted. Pile carpets, like flat carpets, can be woven on a loom. Both vertical and horizontal looms have been used in the production of European and oriental carpets. The warp threads are set up on the frame of the loom before weaving begins. A number of weavers may work together on the same carpet. A row of knots is completed and cut. The knots are secured with (usually one to four) rows of weft. The warp in woven carpet is usually cotton and the weft is jute.{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}}\n\nThere are several styles of knotting, but the two main types of knot are the '''symmetrical''' (also called Turkish or [[Ghiordes knot|Ghiordes]]) and '''asymmetrical''' (also called Persian or [[Senna knot|Senna]]). Contemporary centres of knotted carpet production are: [[Lahore]] and [[Peshawar]] ([[Pakistan]]), [[Kashmir]] ([[India]]), [[Mirzapur]] and [[Bhadohi]] ([[India]]),<ref name=\"to\">{{cite news|url=http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2010-09-09/varanasi/28226568_1_bhadohi-mirzapur-bhadohi-carpet-carpet-manufacturers-association|title=Famed Bhadohi carpet gets GI tag|date=September 9, 2010|work=The Times of India}}</ref>[[Tabriz]] ([[Iran]]), [[Afghanistan]], [[Armenia]], [[Azerbaijan]], [[Turkey]], [[Northern Africa]], [[Nepal]], [[Spain]], [[Turkmenistan]], and [[Tibetan rugs|Tibet]]. The importance of carpets in the culture of Turkmenistan is such that [[Flag of Turkmenistan|the national flag]] features a vertical red stripe near the hoist side, containing five carpet guls (designs used in producing rugs). Kashmir is known for handknotted carpets of silk or wool. The [[GoodWeave]] labelling scheme used throughout [[Europe]] and [[North America]] assures that child labour has not been used: importers pay for the labels, and the revenue collected is used to monitor centres of production and educate previously exploited children.<ref name=\"autogenerated1\"/>\n\n===Tufted===\n[[File:Swatches of carpet 1.jpg|thumb|[[Textile sample|Swatches]] of [[Tufting|tufted]] carpet]]\n[[Image:OurikaValleyCarpets.jpg|thumb|Drying carpets in a village workshop at the [[Ourika Valley|Ourika Valley, Morocco]]]]\nThese are carpets that have their pile injected into a backing material, which is itself then bonded to a secondary backing made of a woven [[hessian (cloth)|hessian]] weave or a man made alternative to provide stability. The pile is often sheared in order to achieve different textures. This is the most common method of manufacturing of domestic carpets for floor covering purposes in the world.\n\n===Others===\nA '''flatweave''' carpet is created by interlocking warp (vertical) and weft (horizontal) threads. Types of oriental flatwoven carpet include [[kilim]], [[soumak]], [[plain weave]], and [[tapestry weave]]. Types of European flatwoven carpets include Venetian, Dutch, [[damask]], list, [[haircloth]], and ingrain (aka double cloth, two-ply, triple cloth, or three-ply).\n\nA '''hooked rug''' is a simple type of rug handmade by pulling strips of cloth such as wool or cotton through the meshes of a sturdy fabric such as burlap. This type of rug is now generally made as a [[handicraft]]. The process of creating a hooked rug is called [[Rug hooking]]<ref>{{cite web|title=The Science Of Color Enhances Carpet Style|url=http://www.carpet-rug.org/Carpet-for-Business/Specifying-the-Right-Carpet/Dyeing-and-Color-Selection.aspx|website=carpet-rug.org|accessdate=28 October 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151019002910/http://www.carpet-rug.org/Carpet-for-Business/Specifying-the-Right-Carpet/Dyeing-and-Color-Selection.aspx|archive-date=2015-10-19|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nUnlike woven carpets, '''[[embroidery]] carpets'''' are not formed on a loom. Their pattern is established by the application of [[stitch (textile arts)|stitches]] to a [[cloth]] (often [[linen]]) base. The tent stitch and the cross stitch are two of the most common. Embroidered carpets were traditionally made by royal and aristocratic women in the home, but there has been some commercial manufacture since steel needles were introduced (earlier needles were made of bone) and linen weaving improved in the 16th century. [[Mary, Queen of Scots]], is known to have been an avid embroiderer. 16th century designs usually involve scrolling vines and regional flowers (for example, the [[Bradford carpet]]). They often incorporate animal heraldry and the [[coat of arms]] of the maker. Production continued through the 19th century. [[Victorian era|Victorian]] embroidered carpet compositions include highly illusionistic, 3-dimensional flowers. Patterns for tiled carpets made of a number of squares, called [[Berlin wool work]], were introduced in [[Germany]] in 1804, and became extremely popular in England in the 1830s. Embroidered carpets can also include other features such as a pattern of shapes, or they can even tell a story.\n\n==Fibres and yarns==\n[[File:Stamp of Moldova 138.jpg|thumb|A [[Moldova]]n [[Postage stamp|stamp]] featuring a carpet]]\nCarpet can be formulated from many single or blended [[nature|natural]] and [[synthetic fibre]]s. Fibres are chosen for durability, appearance, ease of manufacture, and cost. In terms of scale of production, the dominant yarn constructions are polyamides (nylons) and polypropylene with an estimated 90% of the commercial market.<ref>Gudrun Heisterberg-Moutsis, Rainer Heinz, Thomas F. Wolf, Dominic J. Harper, David James, Richard P. Mazzur, Volker Kettler, Hansgert Soin\u00e9 \"Floor Coverings\" Ullmann's Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry 2002, Wiley-VCH, Weinheim. {{DOI|10.1002/14356007.a11_263}}</ref>\n\n===Nylon===\nSince the 20th century, [[nylon]] is one of the most common materials for the construction of carpets. Both [[nylon 6]] and [[nylon 6-6]] are used. Nylon can be dyed topically or dyed in a molten state (solution dying). Nylon can be printed easily and has excellent wear characteristics. Due to nylon's excellent wear-resistance, it is widely used in industrial and commercial carpeting. In carpets, nylon tends to stain easily because of the dye sites which exist on the fibre. These dye sites need to be filled in order to give nylon carpet any type of stain resistance. As nylon is petroleum-based it varies in price with the price of oil.\n\n===Polypropylene===\n[[Polypropylene]], a [[polyolefin]] stiffer than the cheaper [[polyethylene]], is used to produce carpet yarns because it is still less expensive than the other materials used for carpets. It is difficult to dye and does not wear as well as wool or nylon. Polypropylene, sometimes referred to simply as \"olefin\", is commonly used to construct berber carpets. Large looped olefin berber carpets are usually only suited for light domestic use and tend to mat down quickly. Berber carpets with smaller loops tend to be more resilient and retain their new appearance longer than large looped berber styles. Commercial grade level-loop carpets have very small loops, and commercial grade cut-pile styles can be well constructed. When made with polypropylene, commercial grade styles wear very well, making them very suitable for areas with heavy foot traffic such as offices. Polypropylene carpets are known to have good stain resistance, but not against oil- based agents. If a stain does set, it can be difficult to clean. Commercial grade carpets can be glued directly to the floor or installed over a 1/4\" thick, 8-pound density padding. Outdoor grass carpets are usually made from polypropylene.\n\n===Wool and wool-blends===\n[[File:2012-10-02 Wurstteppich huchwasistdenndas anagoria.jpg|thumb|A wool carpet]]\n[[Wool]] has excellent durability, can be dyed easily and is fairly abundant. When blended with synthetic fibres such as nylon the durability of wool is increased. Blended wool yarns are extensively used in production of modern carpet, with the most common blend being 80% wool to 20% synthetic fibre, giving rise to the term \"80/20\". Wool is relatively expensive and consequently it only comprises a small portion of the market.\n\n===Polyester===\nThe [[polyester]] known as \"PET\" ([[polyethylene terephthalate]]) is used in carpet manufacturing in both spun and filament constructions. After the price of raw materials for many types of carpet rose in the early 2000s, polyester became more competitive. Polyester has good physical properties and is inherently stain-resistant because it is hydrophobic, and, unlike nylon, does not have dye sites. Colour is infused in a molten state (solution dyeing). Polyester has the disadvantage that it tends to crush or mat down easily. It is typically used in mid- to low-priced carpeting.\n\nAnother polyester, \"PTT\" ([[Polytrimethylene terephthalate]]), also called Sorona or 3GT (Dupont) or Corterra (Shell), is a variant of PET. Lurgi Zimmer PTT was first patented in 1941, but it was not produced until the 1990s, when Shell Chemicals developed the low-cost method of producing high-quality 1,3 propanediol (PDO), the starting raw material for PTT Corterra Polymers. DuPont subsequently commercialized a [[biological process]] for making [[1,3-propanediol]] from [[corn syrup]], imparting significant [[Renewable resource|renewable]] content on the corresponding Sorona polyester carpet fibers.<ref name=Sengupta>{{cite book|last1=Sengupta|first1=Debolina|last2=Pike|first2=Ralph W.|title=Chemicals from Biomass: Ingegrating Bioprocess into Chemical Production|date=July 5, 2012|publisher=CRC Press|isbn=978-1439878149|page=95|url=https://books.google.com/?id=Z9N_xWEGI9wC&pg=PA95&lpg=PA95&dq=1,3-propanediol+production+tennessee#v=onepage&q=1%2C3-propanediol%20production%20tennessee&f=false|accessdate=27 January 2015}}</ref> These carpet fibers have resiliency comparable to nylon.<ref name=Chuah>{{cite book|last1=Chuah|first1=Hoe H.|title=Poly(trimethylene terephthalate)|journal=Encyclopedia of Polymer Science and Technology|date=22 October 2001|doi=10.1002/0471440264.pst292|isbn=978-0471440260}}</ref>\n\n===Acrylic===\n[[Acrylic fiber|Acrylic]] is a synthetic material first created by the Dupont Corporation in 1941 but has gone through various changes since it was first introduced. In the past, acrylic carpet used to fuzz or \"pill\" easily. This happened when the fibres degraded over time and short strands broke away with contact or friction. Over the years, new types of acrylics have been developed to alleviate some of these problems, although the issues have not been completely removed. Acrylic is fairly difficult to dye but is colourfast, washable, and has the feel and appearance of wool, making it a good rug fabric.\n\n==History==\n[[File: Pazyryk carpet.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Pazyryk burials#Pazyryk carpet|Pazyryk]] Carpet, the oldest surviving carpet in the world ([[Armenia]] or [[Iran|Persia]], 5th century BC)]]\n[[File:The Czartoryski Carpet.jpg|thumb|upright|The [[Czartoryski]] carpet with coat of arms of the Polish Myszkowski family,<ref name=polish /> made with a [[cotton]] warp, a [[silk]] weft and pile, and metal wrapped thread (Iran, 17th century)]]\nThe knotted pile carpet probably originated in the [[Caspian Sea]] area (Northern Iran) <ref>E.J.W.

Famous Afghan rugs include the ''[[Shindand, Herat|Shindand]]'' or ''[[Adraskan]]'' (named after local Afghan villages), woven in the [[Herat Province|Herat]] area in western Afghanistan.\n\nAfghan carpets are commonly known as Afghan rugs. Afghan carpets are a unique and well recognized handmade material design that originates from Afghanistan. They often exhibit intricate detailing, mainly using traditional tribal designs originating from the Turkmen, Kazakh, Baloch, and Uzbeks. The hand-made rugs come in many patterns and colors, yet the traditional and most common example of Afghan carpet is the octagon-shaped elephant-foot (Bukhara). The rugs with this print are most commonly red in color. Many dyes, such as [[vegetable dye]]s, are used to impart rich color.\n\n===Armenia===\n{{main|Armenian carpet}}\n\nThe historian Herodotus writing in the 5th century BC also informs us that the inhabitants of the Caucasus wove beautiful rugs with brilliant colors which would never fade.[23] Various rug fragments have been excavated in Armenia dating back to the 7th century BC or earlier. The oldest, single, surviving knotted carpet in existence is the Pazyryk carpet, excavated from a frozen tomb in Siberia, dated from the 5th to the 3rd century BC, now in the Hermitage Museum in St. Petersburg.

According to Iranica Online \"''The main weaving zone was in the eastern Transcaucasus south of the mountains that bisect the region diagonally, the area now comprised in the Azerbaijan SSR; it is the homeland of a Turkic population known today as Azeri.

While traditionally schools are divided into four main branches, each region has its own version of the carpets. The Schools are divided into four main branches: Kuba-Shirvan, Ganja-Kazakh carpet-weaving school, The Baku carpet school, Karabakh school of carpet weaving.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://unesco.preslib.az/en/page/HnJIbef9wa|title=Traditional art of Azerbaijani carpet weaving in the Republic of Azerbaijan|last=|first=|date=|website=unesco.preslib.az|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2019-09-18}}</ref> Carpet weaving is a family tradition in [[Azerbaijan]] which is transferred verbally and with practicing and also associated with the daily life and customs of its people. A variety of carpet and rug types are made in Azerbaijan such as silk, wool, gold and silver threads, pile and pileless carpets, as well as, kilim, sumakh, zili, verni, mafrashi and khurjun. In 2010, traditional art of Azerbaijani carpet weaving was added to the [[Representative List of the Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity]] of [[UNESCO]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://ich.unesco.org/en/lists|title=UNESCO - Traditional art of Azerbaijani carpet weaving in the Republic of Azerbaijan|website=ich.unesco.org|language=en|access-date=2019-09-18}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://unesco.preslib.az/en/page/HnJIbef9wa|title=Traditional art of Azerbaijani carpet weaving in the Republic of Azerbaijan|last=|first=|date=|website=unesco.preslib.az|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2019-09-18}}</ref>\n\n===China===\n{{See also|Oriental rug}}\nAs opposed to most antique rug manufactory practices, Chinese carpets were woven almost exclusively for internal consumption. China has a long history of exporting traditional goods; however, it was not until the first half of the 19th century that the Chinese began to export their rugs. Once in contact with western influences, there was a large change in production: Chinese manufactories began to produce [[art-deco]] rugs with [[commerce|commercial]] look and price point. The centuries-old Chinese textile industry is rich in history. While most antique carpets are classified according to a specific region or manufactory, scholars attribute the age of any specific Chinese rug to the ruling emperor of the time. The earliest surviving examples of the craft were produced during the time of [[Ch'ung Chen]], the last emperor of the [[Chen Dynasty]].\n\n===India===\n\nCarpet weaving may have been introduced into the area as far back as the eleventh century with the coming of the first Muslim conquerors, the [[Ghaznavids]] and the [[Ghauris]], from the West. It can with more certainty be traced to the beginning of the Mughal Dynasty in the early sixteenth century, when the last successor of Timur, Babar, extended his rule from Kabul to India to found the Mughal Empire. Under the patronage of the Mughals, Indian craftsmen adopted Persian techniques and designs. Carpets woven in the Punjab made use of motifs and decorative styles found in Mughal architecture.\n\n[[Akbar]], a Mogul emperor, is accredited to introducing the art of carpet weaving to India during his reign. The Mughal emperors patronized Persian carpets for their royal courts and palaces. During this period, he brought Persian craftsmen from their homeland and established them in India. Initially, the carpets woven showed the classic Persian style of fine knotting. Gradually it blended with Indian art. Thus the carpets produced became typical of the Indian origin and gradually the industry began to diversify and spread all over the subcontinent. During the Mughal period, the carpets made on the Indian subcontinent became so famous that demand for them spread abroad. These carpets had distinctive designs and boasted a high density of knots. Carpets made for the Mughal emperors, including Jahangir and Shah Jahan, were of the finest quality. Under Shah Jahan's reign, Mughal carpet weaving took on a new aesthetic and entered its classical phase.{{citation needed|date=April 2012}} Indian carpets are well known for their designs with attention to detail and presentation of realistic attributes. The carpet industry in India flourished more in its northern part with major centres found in Kashmir, Jaipur, [[Agra]] and Bhadohi.\n\nIndian carpets are known for their high density of knotting. Hand-knotted carpets are a speciality and widely in demand in the West. The carpet industry in India has been successful in establishing social business models that help underprivileged sections of the society. Notable examples of [[social entrepreneurship]] ventures are [[Jaipur rugs]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://chillibreeze.com/articles_various/Jaipur-rugs-1101.asp |title=A Case of Social Entrepreneurship |publisher=Chillibreeze.com |accessdate=2013-10-04 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131004215919/http://www.chillibreeze.com/articles_various/Jaipur-rugs-1101.asp |archivedate=October 4, 2013 }}</ref> [[Fabindia]].<ref>{{cite news| url=http://articles.economictimes.indiatimes.com/2008-05-06/news/27717265_1_handloom-weavers-shareholders-fabric-suppliers |title= Handloom weavers shareholders fabric suppliers | work=The Times Of India | date=2008-05-06}}</ref>\n\nAnother category of Indian rugs which, though quite popular in most of the western countries, have not received much press, is hand-woven rugs of Khairabad (Citapore rugs). {{citation needed|date=April 2012}} [[Khairabad, Sitapur|Khairabad]] small town in Citapore (now spelled as \"[[Sitapur]]\") district of India had been ruled by Raja [[Mehmoodabad]]. Khairabad (Mehmoodabad Estate) was part of [[Oudh]] province which had been ruled by [[shi'i]] Muslims having Persian linkages. Citapore rugs made in Khairabad and neighbouring areas are all hand-woven and distinct from tufted and knotted rugs. Flat weave is the basic weaving technique of Citapore rugs and generally cotton is the main weaving material here but jute, rayon and chenille are also popular. ''[[IKEA]]'' and ''[[Agocha]]'' have been major buyers of rugs from this area.\n\n===Pakistan===\n{{Main|Pakistani rug}}\n\nThe art of weaving developed in South Asia at a time when few other civilizations employed it. Excavations at [[Harappa]] and [[Mohenjo-Daro]]\u2013 ancient cities of the [[Indus Valley Civilization]]\u2013 have established that the inhabitants used spindles and spun a wide variety of weaving materials. Some historians consider that the Indus Valley civilization first developed the use of woven textiles. As of the late 1990s, hand-knotted carpets were among Pakistan's leading export products and their manufacture is the second largest cottage and small industry. Pakistani craftsmen have the capacity to produce any type of carpet using all the popular motifs of gulls, medallions, paisleys, traceries, and geometric designs in various combinations.<ref>Stone, Peter F. The Oriental Rug Lexicon. Seattle: University of Washington Press, 1997.</ref> At the time of independence, manufacturing of carpets was set up in [[Sangla Hill]], a small town of District Sheikhupura. Chaudary Mukhtar Ahmad Member son of Maher Ganda introduced and taught this art to locals and immigrants. He is considered founder of this industry in Pakistan. Sangla Hill is now a focal point in Carpet Industry in Pakistan. Almost all the exporters and manufacturers who are running their business at Lahore, Faisalabad and Karachi have their area offices in Sangla Hill.\n\n===Persia [[Iran]]===\n{{Main|Persian carpet}}\n[[File:Carpet Tree of Life.JPG|thumb|A [[Tree of Life]] pattern]]\n[[Image:Giulio Rosati 14.jpg|thumb|upright|''The Carpet Seller'' ([[Giulio Rosati]])]]\nThe Persian carpet is a part of Persian (Iranian) art and culture. Carpet-[[weaving]] in Persia dates back to the [[Bronze Age]]. The earliest surviving corpus of Persian carpets come from the [[Safavid]] dynasty (1501\u20131736) in the 16th century. However, painted depictions prove a longer history of production. There is much variety among classical Persian carpets of the 16th and 17th century. Common motifs include scrolling vine networks, [[Arabesque (Islamic art)|arabesque]]s, [[palmette]]s, [[cloud band]]s, medallions, and overlapping geometric compartments rather than animals and humans.{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}} This is because [[Islam]], the dominant religion in that part of the world, forbids their depiction.{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}} Still, some show figures engaged either in the hunt or feasting scenes.

Turkish pile rugs and kilims are also frequently used as tent decorations, grain bags, camel and donkey bags, ground cushions, oven covers, sofa covers, bed and cushion covers, blankets, curtains, eating blankets, table top spreads, prayer rugs and for ceremonial occasions.\n\nThe oldest records of flat woven kilims come from [[\u00c7atalh\u00f6y\u00fck]] Neolithic pottery, circa 7000 B.C.

Until the mid-18th century they were mostly used on walls and tables. Except in royal or ecclesiastical settings they were considered too precious to cover the floor. Starting in the 13th century oriental carpets begin to appear in paintings (notably from Italy, Flanders, England, France, and the Netherlands). Carpets of Indo-Persian design were introduced to Europe via the Dutch, British, and French [[East India Company|East India Companies]] of the 17th and 18th century<ref>Dimand, Maurice Sven and Jean Mailey.

Documentary evidence shows production beginning in Spain as early as the 10th century AD. The earliest extant Spanish carpet, the so-called Synagogue carpet in the Museum of Islamic Art, Berlin, is a unique survival dated to the 14th century. The earliest group of Hispano-Moresque carpets, Admiral carpets (also known as armorial carpets), has an all-over geometric, repeat pattern punctuated by blazons of noble, Christian Spanish families. The variety of this design was analyzed most thoroughly by [[May Beattie]]. Many of the 15th-century, Spanish carpets rely heavily on designs originally developed on the Anatolian Peninsula.{{Citation needed|date=December 2019}} Carpet production continued after the Reconquest of Spain and eventual expulsion of the Muslim population in the 15th century. 16th-century Renaissance Spanish carpet design is a derivative of silk textile design. Some of the most popular motifs are [[wreath]]s, [[Acanthus (ornament)|acanthus leaves]] and [[pomegranates]].\n\nDuring the [[Moorish]] (Muslim) period production took place in [[Alcaraz]] in the province of Murcia, as well as being recorded in other towns. Carpet production after the Christian reconquest continued in Alcaraz while [[Cuenca, Spain|Cuenca]], first recorded as a weaving centre in the 12th century, became increasingly important, and was dominant in the 17th and early 18th century. Carpets of completely different French based designs began to be woven in a royal workshop, the [[Royal Tapestry Factory]] ''(Real F\u00e1brica de Tapices de Santa B\u00e1rbara)'' in Madrid in the 18th century. Cuenca was closed down by the royal degree of Carlos IV in the late 18th century to stop it competing with the new workshop. Madrid continued as a weaving centre through to the 20th century, producing brightly coloured carpets most of whose designs are strongly influenced by French carpet design, and which are frequently signed (on occasions with the monogram MD; also sometimes with the name Stuyck) and dated in the outer stripe. After the [[Spanish civil war]] [[General Franco]] revived the carpet weaving industry in workshops named after him, weaving designs that are influenced by earlier Spanish carpets, usually in a very limited range of colours.<ref name=\"Sherrill, Sarah B 1996\">Sherrill, Sarah B.

Pirot kilims with some 122 ornaments and 96 different types have been protected by geographical indication in 2002. They are one of the most important traditional handicrafts in Serbia. In the late 19th century and up to the Second World War, Pirot kilims have been frequently used as insignia of Serbian and Yugoslav royalty. This tradition was revived in 2011 when Pirot kilims were reintroduced for state ceremonies in Serbia. Carpet weaving in Pirot dates back to the Middle Ages.<ref>LEPOTA TRAJANJA</ref>{{full citation needed|date=December 2018}} One of the first mentions of the Pirot kilim in written sources date to 1565, when it was said that the \u0161ajka\u0161i boats on the Danube and Drava were covered with Pirot kilims. Pirot was once the most important rug-making centre in the Balkans. Pirot is located on the historical main highway which linked central Europe with Constantinople.Pirot was also known as \u015eark\u00f6y in Turkish. The Pirot carpet varieties are also found in Bulgaria and Turkey, and in many other international collections. One of the chief qualities are the colour effects achieved through the choice and arrangement of colours.\n\nIn the beginning of the 19th century plant dyes were replaced by aniline colourings. \"The best product of the country is the Pirot carpet, worth about ten shillings a square metre. The designs are extremely pretty, and the rugs, without being so heavy as the Persian, or so ragged and scant in the web and weft as Caramanian, wear for ever. The manufacture of these is almost entirely confined to Pirot. From Pirots old Turkish signification as \u015eark\u00f6y stems the traditional trade name of the rugs as \u015eark\u00f6y-kilims. Stemming from the homonym to the today's Turkish settlement of \u015eark\u00f6y in Thracia, which had no established rug making tradition, \u015eark\u00f6ys are often falsely ascribed to originate from Turkey. Also in the rug selling industry, \u015eark\u00f6y are mostly labeled as being of oriental or Turkish origin as to easier sell them to non familiar customers as they prefer rug with putative oriental origin. In fact, \u015eark\u00f6ys have been established from the 17th century in the region of the Western Balkan or Stara Planina mountains in the towns of Pirot, Berkowiza, Lom, Chiprovtsi and Samokow. Later they have been also produced in Knja\u017eevac and Caribrod.\n\n===Bulgaria===\n{{main |Chiprovtsi carpet}}\nThe [[Chiprovtsi carpet]] (\u0427\u0438\u043f\u0440\u043e\u0432\u0446\u0438 \u043a\u0438\u043b\u0438\u043c) is a type of handmade carpet with two absolutely identical sides, part of Bulgarian national heritage, traditions, arts and crafts. Its name is derived from the town of [[Chiprovtsi]] where their production started in the 17th century. The carpet weaving industry played a key role in the revival of Chiprovtsi in the 1720s after the devastation of the failed 1688 [[Chiprovtsi Uprising]] against Ottoman rule. The western traveller [[Ami Bou\u00e9]], who visited Chiprovtsi in 1836\u20131838, reported that \"mainly young girls, under shelters or in corridors, engage in carpet weaving.

This production was soon moved to the Savonnerie factory in Chaillot just west of Paris. The earliest, well-known group produced by the Savonnerie, then under the direction of [[Simon Lourdet]], are the carpets that were produced in the early years of [[Louis XIV of France|Louis XIV]]'s reign. They are densely ornamented with flowers, sometimes in vases or baskets, against dark blue or brown grounds in deep borders. The designs are based on Netherlandish and Flemish textiles and paintings. The most famous Savonnerie carpets are the series made for the Grande Galerie and the Galerie d'Apollon in the [[Palais du Louvre]] between c. 1665-1685. These 105 masterpieces, made under the artistic direction of [[Charles Le Brun]], were never installed, as Louis XIV moved the court to [[Palace of Versailles|Versailles]] in 1688. Their design combines rich [[Acanthus (ornament)|acanthus]] leaves, architectural framing, and mythological scenes (inspired by [[Cesare Ripa]]'s Iconologie) with emblems of Louis XIV's royal power.\n\n{{Q|Q28017591|Pierre-Josse Joseph Perrot}} is the best-known of the mid-eighteenth-century carpet designers. His many surviving works and drawings display graceful rococo s-scrolls, central rosettes, shells, acanthus leaves, and floral swags. The Savonnerie manufactory was moved to the [[Gobelins manufactory|Gobelins]] in Paris in 1826.<ref>(french) [https://books.google.com/books?id=bN_HkKC1xNUC&pg=PA47&dq=savonnerie+manufacture+gobelins+1826&hl=fr&ei=5frOTtrDD4f3sgbnm6XCDA&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=3&sqi=2&ved=0CEIQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&q=savonnerie%20manufacture%20gobelins%201826&f=false Jean Coural, ''Les Gobelins'', Nouvelles Editions Latines, 1989, p. 47]</ref> The Beauvais manufactory, better known for their [[tapestry]], also made knotted pile carpets from 1780 to 1792. Carpet production in small, privately owned workshops in the town of [[Aubusson, Creuse|Aubusson]] began in 1743. Carpets produced in France employ the symmetrical knot.<ref name=\"Sherrill, Sarah B 1996\"/>\n\n===England===\nKnotted pile carpet weaving technology probably came to England in the early 16th century with [[Flemings|Flemish]] [[Calvinist]]s fleeing religious persecution. Because many of these weavers settled in South-eastern [[England]] in Norwich the 14 extant 16th and 17th century carpets are sometimes referred to as \"Norwich carpets.\" These works are either adaptations of Anatolian or Indo-Persian designs or employ Elizabethan-Jacobean scrolling vines and blossoms. All but one are dated or bear a coat of arms. Like the French, English weavers used the symmetrical knot. There are documented and surviving examples of carpets from three 18th-century manufactories: Exeter (1756\u20131761, owned by [[Claude Passavant]], 3 extant carpets), Moorfields (1752\u20131806, owned by Thomas Moore, 5 extant carpets), and Axminster (1755\u20131835, owned by [[Thomas Whitty]], numerous extant carpets). Exeter and Moorfields were both staffed with renegade weavers from the French Savonnerie and, therefore, employ the weaving structure of that factory and Perrot-inspired designs. Neoclassical designer [[Robert Adam]] supplied designs for both Moorfields and Axminster carpets based on [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] floor [[mosaics]] and coffered ceilings. Some of the most well-known rugs of his design were made for [[Syon House]], [[Osterley House]], [[Harewood House]], [[Saltram House]], and [[Newby Hall]].\n\n{{visible anchor|Axminster carpet}} was a unique floor covering made originally in a [[Axminster Carpets|factory]] founded at Axminster, Devon, England, in 1755 by the cloth weaver [[Thomas Whitty]]. Resembling somewhat the Savonnerie carpets produced in France, Axminster carpets were symmetrically knotted by hand in wool on woolen warps and had a weft of flax or hemp. Like the French carpets, they often featured Renaissance architectural or floral patterns; others mimicked oriental patterns. Similar carpets were produced at the same time in Exeter and in the Moorfields section of London and, shortly before, at Fulham in Middlesex. The Whitty factory closed in 1835 with the advent of machine-made carpeting. The name Axminster, however, survived as a generic term for machine-made carpets whose pile is produced by techniques similar to those used in making velvet or chenille.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/46332/Axminster-carpet |title=Axminster carpet - Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica |publisher=Britannica.com |date= |accessdate=2013-10-04}}</ref>\n\nAxminster carpet has three main types of broadloom carpet construction in use today (machine woven, tufted & hand knotted). Machine woven carpet is an investment that will last 20 or 30 years and woven Axminster and Wilton carpets are still extremely popular in areas where longevity and design flexibility are a big part of the purchasing decision. Hotels and leisure venues almost always choose these types and many homes use woven Axminsters as design statements.\n\n[[File:Rug.jpg|thumb|Machine used to cut and re-roll carpet lengths]]\nMachine-woven carpets like Axminster and Wilton are made by massive looms that weave together \u2018bobbins\u2019 of carpet yarn and backing. The finished result, which can be intricately patterned, creates a floor that provides supreme underfoot luxury with high performance. Tufted carpets are also popular in the home. They are relatively speedy to make - a pre-woven backing has yarns tufted into it. Needles push the yarn through the backing and which is then held in place with underlying \"loopers\". Tufted carpets can be twist pile, velvet, or loop pile. Twist pile carpets are produced when one or more fibres are twisted in the tufting process, so that in the finished carpet they appear to be bound together. Velvet pile carpets tend to have a shorter pile and a tighter construction, giving the finished article a smooth, velvety appearance. Loop pile carpets are renowned for being hard wearing and lend carpets great texture. The traditional domain of rugs from far away continents, hand knotted squares and rugs use the expertise of weavers to produce work of the finest quality. Traditional rugs often feature a deliberate \u2018mistake\u2019 on behalf of the weaver to guarantee their authenticity.\n\nSix of Axminster carpets are known as the \"Lansdowne\" group. These have a tripartite design with reeded circles and baskets of flowers in the central panel flanked by diamond lozenges in the side panels. Axminster Rococo designs often have a brown ground and include birds copied from popular, contemporary engravings. Even now a large percentage of the 55,000 population town still seek employment in this industry. The town of [[Wilton, Wiltshire]] is also known for its carpet weaving, which dates back to the 18th century.<ref>{{cite book|title=Interior Decoration: A Complete Source|url=https://books.google.com/?id=_btgLVQUVL0C&dq=lansdowne+group+axminster+carpets|accessdate=2011-11-14|isbn=9788189940652|last1=Morris|first1=Shirley|date=2007-06-28}}</ref>\n\nThe Brussels Loom was introduced into England towards the middle of the eighteenth century marked the beginning of a new era in carpet-weaving. It was the first loom on which a pile carpet could be woven mechanically, the pile consisting of rows of loops, formed over wires inserted weftwise during weaving and subsequently withdrawn. Brussels was the first type of carpet to be woven in a loom incorporating the jacquard pattern selecting mechanism and in 1849 power was applied to the loom by Biglow in the U.S.A.\n\nLater when bladed wires were developed the pile loops were severed on withdrawal of the blade wires to produce a carpet known as Wilton, after this development the loom became known as the Wilton loom, and in modern usage the designation Wilton applies to both cut-pile and loop-pile carpets made in this loom. The latter now variously described as Brussels-Wilton, round wire Wilton, loop-pile Wilton, and round wired jacquard. The methods of manufacture, including the principles of designing, preparatory processes, and weaving, are the same in most respects for both Brussels and Wilton qualities. The chief difference between them is that whereas Brussels loop-pile is secured satisfactorily by the insertion of two picks of weft to each wire (2-shot), the Wilton cut-pile is woven more often with three picks of weft to each wire (3-shot) to ensure that the tufts are firmly secured in the carpet backing.\n\nBrussels carpets have a smooth slightly ribbed surface and their patterning is well defined, a characteristic feature of the carpet. Closeness of pile rather than height contributes to their neat appearance and hard wearing properties, although they do not simulate the luxury of cut-pile carpets. Brussels Wilton Carpets were initially produced on 27-inch (3/4) looms and were sewn together by hand. The looms could incorporate up to 5 frames all with different colours thus enabling figured or pattern carpets to be manufactured. With judicial and very skilful planting of colours in the frames the number of colours could be increased to about twenty, thus enabling very complex designs to be produced. Due to the additional costs in labour these carpets were normally only produced for the bespoke market.\n\nAfter the first World War the carpets started to be produced for the general market using popular designs and colourways but they always remained at the luxury end of the general market. The growing middle class of the twentieth century aspired to acquire a Wilton carpet for their 'best' room. Despite the impact of industrialization, the areas where Brussels Wilton carpets were produced remained centred mainly in the Midlands around the towns of Wilton and Kidderminster and in West Yorkshire where the firm of John Crossley and Sons in Halifax became synonymous with carpet manufacture. There were smaller areas of manufacture in Scotland and Durham. With the development of different manufacturing methods and looms capable of the mass production of carpets, the public began change their d\u00e9cor, including carpets, on a regular basis, which increased the demand for carpets. The last quarter of the 20th century saw the rapid decline of the labour-intensive Brussels Wilton carpets. Very few of the original \u00be Wilton looms still exist and the few that do are either in museums or used by small manufacturers that continue to produce custom made luxury carpets for the elite and to replace carpets in historic buildings in the UK and abroad.<ref>''Carpets'' by George Robinson F.T.I., F.S.D.C. published 1966 Chap 7 Wilton Carpets page 72.</ref>\n\n==Modern carpeting and installation==\n[[File:Berber Carpet (macro).jpg|thumb|[[Macro photography|Macro]] shot of a [[Berber carpet|Berber-style carpet]]. Berber-style carpets feature two sizes of tufts of varying colors in a loop pile construction]]\nCarpet is commonly made in widths of {{convert|12|ft|m}} and {{convert|15|ft|m}} in the US, 4&nbsp;m and 5&nbsp;m in Europe. Where necessary different widths can be seamed together with a seaming iron and seam tape (formerly it was [[sewing|sewn]] together) and it is fixed to a floor over a cushioned [[underlay]] (pad) using nails, [[tack strip]]s (known in the UK as gripper rods), adhesives, or occasionally decorative metal [[stair rod]]s, thus distinguishing it from rugs or [[mat]]s, which are loose-laid floor coverings. For environmental reasons, the use of wool, natural bindings, natural padding, and formaldehyde-free glues is becoming more common. These options are almost always at a premium cost.\n\nIn the UK, some carpets are still manufactured for yachts, hotels, pubs and clubs in a narrow width of {{convert|27|in|m}} and then sewn to size. Carpeting which covers an entire room area is loosely referred to as 'wall-to-wall', but carpet can be installed over any portion thereof with use of appropriate transition moldings where the carpet meets other types of floor coverings. Carpeting is more than just a single item; it is, in fact, a system comprising the carpet itself, the carpet backing (often made of latex), the cushioning underlay, and a method of installation.\nCarpet tiles are also available, typically {{convert|50|cm|in}} square. These are usually only used in commercial settings and are affixed using a special pressure-sensitive glue, which holds them into place while allowing easy removal (in an office environment, for example) or to allow rearrangement in order to spread wear.<ref>Fletcher, Alan J. The Complete Carpet Buying Guide. Portland Oregon: AJ Books 2006.</ref>\n\n\"Carpet binding\" is a term used for any material being applied to the edge of a carpet to make a rug. Carpet binding is usually cotton or nylon, but also comes in many other materials such as leather. Non-synthetic binding is frequently used with bamboo, grass and wool rugs, but is often used with carpet made from other materials.\n\n==In culture and figurative expressions==\n[[File:Vasnetsov samolet.jpg|thumb|A mythical [[magic carpet]]]]\nThere are many stories about [[magic carpet]]s, legendary flying carpets that can be used to transport people who are on it instantaneously or quickly to their destination. Disney's Aladdin depicts a magic carpet found by Aladdin and Abu in the Cave of Wonders while trying to find Genie's lamp. Aladdin and Jasmine ride on him to go on a ride around the world. The term \"[m]agic carpet [is] first attested [in] 1816.<ref name=\"etymonline1\"/> From the 16th century to the 19th century, the term \"carpet\" was used \"...as an adjective often with a tinge of contempt, when used of men (as in carpet-knight, 1570s)\", which meant a man who was associated with \"...luxury, ladies' boudoirs, and drawing rooms\".<ref name=\"etymonline1\"/> ''Rolling out the red carpet'' is an expression which means to welcome a guest lavishly and handsomely. In some cases, an actual [[red carpet]] is used for VIPs and celebrities to walk on, such as at the [[Cannes Film Festival]] and when foreign dignitaries are welcomed to a country.\n\nIn 1820s British servant slang, to \"carpet\" someone means to call them for a reprimand.<ref name=\"etymonline1\" /> To be ''called on the carpet'' means to be summoned for a serious reason, typically a scolding reprimand; this usage dates from 1900.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.etymonline.com/search?q=carpet.|title=carpet. - Search Online Etymology Dictionary|website=www.etymonline.com}}</ref> A stronger variant of this expression, to be \"hauled on the carpet\", implies an even sterner reprimand. [[Carpet bombing]] is a type of bombing from airplanes which developed in the 20th century in which an entire city is bombed (rather than precise strikes on military targets). The slang expression \"laugh at the carpet\" means to [[vomit]] on the floor (especially a carpeted floor).<ref name=autogenerated2>{{cite web|url=http://idioms.thefreedictionary.com/carpet|title=carpet|publisher=|via=The Free Dictionary}}</ref> The expression \"on the carpet\" refers to a matter which is under discussion or consideration.<ref name=autogenerated2 /> The term \"carpet muncher\" is a derogatory slang term for a [[lesbian]]; this expression is first attested in 1992.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.dictionary.com/browse/carpet-muncher |title=Carpet muncher |website=Dictionary.com<!-- Bot generated title --> |access-date=2018-12-28 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160728191015/http://www.dictionary.com/browse/carpet-muncher |archive-date=2016-07-28 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n[[File:The_Carpet_Seller,_a_figurine_by_Royal_Doulton.jpg|thumb|left|''The Carpet Seller'', a [[Royal Doulton]] figurine]]\nThe term [[carpet bag]], which literally refers to a suitcase made from a piece of carpet, is used in several figurative contexts. The term gained a popular usage after the [[American Civil War]] to refer to [[carpetbaggers]], Northerners who moved to the South after the war, especially during the [[Reconstruction Era of the United States|Reconstruction era]] (1865\u20131877). Carpetbaggers allegedly politically manipulated and controlled former Confederate states for financial and power gains. In modern usage in the U.S., the term is sometimes used derisively to refer to a politician who runs for public office in an area where he or she does not have deep community ties, or has lived only for a short time. In the United Kingdom, the term was adopted to refer informally to those who join a [[mutual organization]], such as a [[building society]], in order to force it to [[Demutualization|demutualize]], that is, to convert into a [[joint stock company]], solely for personal financial gain.\n\n''Cutting the rug'' is a slang term for dancing which originated in 1942.<ref name=\"etymonline2\" /> The use of the term \"rug\" as an informal term for a \"[[toupee]]\" (man's [[wig]]) is [[theater]] slang from 1940.<ref name=\"etymonline2\" /> The term \"sweep [something] under the rug\" or \"sweep [something] under the carpet\" figuratively refers to situations where a person or organization is hiding something embarrassing or negative; this use was first recorded in 1953.<ref name=\"etymonline1\"/> The figurative expression \"pull the rug out from under (someone)\", meaning to \"suddenly deprive of important support\" is first attested to in 1936, in American English. A related figurative expression used centuries earlier was \"cut the grass under (one's) feet\", which is attested to in the 1580s.<ref name=\"etymonline2\" /> A \"rugrat\" or \"rug-rat\" is a slang term for a baby or child, first attested in 1968.<ref name=\"etymonline2\" /> The expression \"snug as a bug in a rug\" means\n\"wrapped up tight, warm, and comfortable\".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://idioms.thefreedictionary.com/snug+as+a+bug+in+a+rug|title=snug as a bug in a rug|website=TheFreeDictionary.com}}</ref> To \"lie like a rug\" means \"to tell lies shamelessly\".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://idioms.thefreedictionary.com/lie+like+a+rug|title=lie like a rug|website=TheFreeDictionary.com}}</ref> The expression \"pull the rug out (from under someone)\" means \"to make someone or someone's plans fall through\" or \"to upset someone's plans\".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://idioms.thefreedictionary.com/pull+the+rug+out|title=pull the rug out|website=TheFreeDictionary.com}}</ref>\n{{clearleft}}\n==See also==\n* [[Floor cleaning]]\n* [[Heatsetting]]\n* [[William Morris]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|colwidth=30em|refs=\n\n<ref name=polish>{{cite web|author=Marcin Latka|title=Polish carpets|url=https://artinpoland.weebly.com/en/polish-carpets|accessdate=2 October 2018|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20181002064840/https://artinpoland.weebly.com/en/polish-carpets#|archivedate=2018-10-02}}</ref>\n}}\n\n==Further reading==\n{{Sister project links| wikt=carpet | commons=Category:Rugs and carpets | b=no | n=no | q=Carpet | s=no | v=no | voy=Carpets | species=no | d=no}}\n*{{cite book |author=Walker, Daniel| title= ''Flowers underfoot : Indian carpets of the Mughal era'' | location=New York | publisher=The Metropolitan Museum of Art | year=1997| url= http://libmma.contentdm.oclc.org/cdm/ref/collection/p15324coll10/id/73761}}\n\n<!--======================== {{No more links}} ============================\n    | PLEASE BE CAUTIOUS IN ADDING MORE LINKS TO THIS ARTICLE.
