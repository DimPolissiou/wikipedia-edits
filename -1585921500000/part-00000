[[Patrick Magee (actor)|Patrick Magee]] played Words and Felix Felton, Croak. Music was composed especially by [[John S. Beckett]].<ref>Gannon, Charles: ''John S. Beckett - The Man and the Music'' (Dublin: 2016, The Lilliput Press), pp. 135, 137-8, 140-3, 365 and 376.</ref> The play first appeared in print in ''[[Evergreen Review]]'' 6.27 (November\u2013December 1962). Beckett himself translated the work into French under the title '''''Paroles et Musique''''' (''[[Les \u00c9ditions de Minuit|Minuit]]'', 1966).\n\nWhile John Fletcher considered ''Words and Music'' the weakest of Beckett\u2019s radio plays, Hugh Kenner considered it arguably the most moving work ever done for radio and Vivian Mercier praised it as one of Beckett\u2019s most powerful works along with ''[[Cascando]]'' (1961).<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xGdf8EK41LMC&pg=PA242|title=Modernism in European Drama: Ibsen, Strindberg, Pirandello, Beckett : Essays from Modern Drama|last=Marker|first=Frederick J.|last2=Innes|first2=Christopher|date=1998|publisher=University of Toronto Press|isbn=9780802082060|location=|pages=242|language=en}}</ref>\n\n==Synopsis==\n\nThe play takes place in what [[Katharine Worth]] describes as \"an unidentified \u2018listening\u2019 space,\"<ref>Worth, K., \u2018Cosmic Scenery\u2019 in ''Samuel Beckett's Theatre: Life Journeys'', (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1999)</ref> another of Beckett\u2019s \"skullscapes.\"<ref>The designation \"skullscape\" is Linda Ben Zvi's, from the recorded discussion that followed the production of ''Embers'' for the Beckett Festival of Radio Plays, recorded at the [[BBC]] Studios, London on January 1988.</ref> The only specific location mentioned is \"the tower\" \u2013 perhaps a [[folly]](?) \u2013 so the scene may well be in a [[castle]] or similarly large building of some kind with Croak in the role of ''[[ch\u00e2telain]]''.\n\n[http://www.thefreedictionary.com/croak Croak]<ref>To croak: a common [[euphemism]] for \"to die\". The suicidal man in ''Rough for Theatre II'' is named Croker.</ref> is a doddery old man, testy and maudlin. He is never referred to by name in the play itself but he is well named. Joe addresses to him \u2013 albeit somewhat obsequiously \u2013 as, \"My Lord,\" since, despite his apparent frailty, he has plainly been someone used to wielding authority. There are only three sound effects used in the entire play, the shuffle [Beckett's descriptive stage direction) of Croak's feet as he arrives and departs, the thud/dropping of his [[Club (weapon)|club]] (staff?) reminiscent of the rulers wielded by the [[Rough for Radio II#Animator|Animator]] in ''[[Rough for Radio II]]'' and the music teacher in ''[[Embers]]'' and the rapping of Music's baton reminiscent of a once prevalent practice among conductors of the past which is now far less widespread. The club and baton function as objects of authority. They form an interesting dyad prominently employed throughout the play.\n\nFor entertainment, Croak, (a Beckettian \u2018[[old King Cole]]\u2019) has only two old stalwarts to call on, his [[minstrel]]s, Joe (Words) and Bob (Music). Each is heard to be possibly an abstraction and/or a being of some sort manifested through their respective vocabularies (music/words). Do they have actual physical form? This remains an unanswerable question. With radio remaining a solely sonic medium, we can only conjecture (Beckett sets up similar uncertainty in much of his work). Words/Music function in a way resembling court artists/musicians of the past. Word's repeatedly addressing Croak as \"My Lord\" and the strange formality to the domination both Words/Joe and Music/Bob seem accustomed to enduring adds an ancient (medieval?) or primitively regal aspect to the proceedings.\n\nThe modern shortened names (Joe, Bob) add a humorous contemporary contrast to the generally ancient (or timeless) seeming circumstances. The source of Croak's power over them is never explained or questioned-adding to the mysterious atmosphere.\n\n[[Al Alvarez|Alfred Alvarez]] refers to Croak as \"a poet\"<ref>Alvarez, A., ''Samuel Beckett'' (New York: Viking Press, 1973), p 119</ref> though there is no real evidence to suggest that he is. In fact his utterances throughout the play are terse: moans, groans and murmurings mainly along with a few short lines (commands, entreaties or outbursts). That said, he appears to appreciate poetry especially when set to music. The first theme Croak proclaims for the evening's diversion is \"Love.\" Beckett offers several clues to help imagine Croak as a specific character. His shuffling feet, choice of themes, self-torturing reminiscence and intense reactions to much of what Words and Music produce/perform all seem to indicate that he is a decrepit version of [[Twelfth Night, or What You Will#List of characters|Orsino]] with his famous opening line from [[Twelfth Night, or What You Will|Twelfth Night]]: \"If music be the food of love, play on,\"<ref>Shakespeare, W., ''Twelfth Night'' (Act 1, Scene 1)</ref> a hopeless romantic, in love with love, and the melancholy brought on by the mere thought of it. Croak could almost be the selfsame man, had he never moved from that spot for the rest of his life and now finds himself perhaps approaching the brink of death. Or does this gathering occur again and again outside time? So many Beckett works present characters seemingly caught in endless cycles of repetition (those who wait in \"Waiting for Godot\"/the appearing-disappearing woman in \"Ill Seen Ill Said\"/The urn-dwelling trio in \"Play\" etc.) that this is always a possibility.\n\nAdditional related aspects of Love that Croak focuses on as sub-themes are \"Age,\" \"Face,\" (With two foreshadowing mentions earlier on in the play-once by Croak and then latter by Words) and the climactic naming of \"Lily\" which is discussed later regarding its various implications. After this iteration Croak is reduced to groans, an anguished \"No!\" and the eventual dropping of his \"club\" followed by shuffling away. His entrance/exit frames the main body of the play.\n\n===Prelude===\n\nThe going is not easy; from the very beginning it's obvious that Words and Music do not enjoy each other's company. The play opens with Music \u2013 a small orchestra \u2013 tuning up much to the irritation of Words who is trying to rehearse a [[Monologue|soliloquy]] on the unlikely theme of [[Sloth (deadly sin)|sloth]]. The orchestra interrupts him in the middle of his speech and again at the end when he's straining to hear if their master is approaching. Squabbling servants appear often in the works of [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]] summoning another parallel. Joe is much like [[Malvolio]], the strait-laced, pompous steward in the household of [[Twelfth Night, or What You Will#List of characters|Lady Olivia]], efficient but also self-righteous, with a poor opinion of drinking, singing, and fun. His priggishness and haughty attitude earn him the enmity of [[Twelfth Night, or What You Will#List of characters|Maria]], Olivia's sharp-witted waiting-gentlewoman. There are moments of jealousy and competitiveness between Words and Music that seem at times relatively overt, adding dimension to their relationship.\n\nCroak shuffles into the room and Joe and Bob both become habitually subservient. They\u2019ve probably been together for a great many years, like [[Hamm (character)|Hamm]] and [[Clov]], and rubbing each other the wrong way has become a means of entertaining themselves when they\u2019re not performing for their master. They could be viewed as prisoners who cannot escape torturing one another. Croak realizes they will have been bickering and gently reproves them: \"My comforts! Be friends.\"<ref>Beckett, S., ''Collected Shorter Plays of Samuel Beckett'' (London: Faber and Faber, 1984), p 127</ref> He apologises for being late and offers a vague excuse: \"The face \u2026 On the stairs \u2026 In the tower.\"<ref>Beckett, S., ''Collected Shorter Plays of Samuel Beckett'' (London: Faber and Faber, 1984), pp 127,128</ref> He apparently doesn\u2019t need to explain further. \"The face\" will be taken up later on and bring Croak added anguish. He seems magnanimous at first but soon enough reveals his impatience, condescension, tyranny and raging.\n\n===Love===\n\nCroak considers for a moment and then announces the primary theme for the night's entertainment: Love. He calls for his club and thumps it on the ground: \"Love!\" We now realise that Joe may have been mocking the old man in his earlier [http://www.thefreedictionary.com/disquisition disquisition] on sloth. The speech he delivers is practically identical to the one he was rehearsing before when the play opens; he has simply swapped \u2018sloth\u2019 with \u2018love\u2019. It is empty [[rhetoric]]. At one point he even stumbles and says \u2018sloth\u2019 by mistake. The feeling is that it wouldn\u2019t matter what the theme chosen was ''this'' was the speech he was intending to deliver: \"\u2018one-size-fits-all\u2019 [http://www.thefreedictionary.com/verbiage verbiage]\" \u2026 [[Polonius]] could not have done better.\"<ref name=\"etd.unisa.ac.za\">Brown, V., ''[http://etd.unisa.ac.za/ETD-db/theses/available/etd-03022006-154713/unrestricted/thesis.pdf Yesterday\u2019s Deformities: A Discussion of the Role of Memory and Discourse in the Plays of Samuel Beckett]'', (doctoral thesis)</ref> Croak is displeased and calls on Bob to offer his sounds based on the theme-his \"interpretation,\" if you will. Croak is still unhappy and wants the music louder. Joe interrupts, overstepping the mark with a [[jester]]\u2019s [http://www.thefreedictionary.com/veracity veracity]: \"What? Is love the word? \u2026 Is soul the word? \u2026 Do we mean love when we say love? \u2026 Soul, when we say soul? \u2026 Do we? \u2026 Or don\u2019t we?\"\n\nCroak finally cries out for Bob's assistance and the recital turns into a shambles.\n\nOnce everything has calmed down he sets a new topic: Age.\n\n===Age===\n\nJoe's words are nowhere near as eloquent here. He had prepared one speech and now has to [[Improvisation|improvise]] a second. Does his master mean ''old'' age? He's not sure. His speech falters and Croak doesn\u2019t put up with him for long. It's unclear if he is trying to mimic an old man's speech pattern or if he has genuinely been caught off guard. Bob's music is also endured for only a short time. Croak's solution is a simple one, force the rivals to work together. They object but acquiesce.\n\nStefan-Brook Grant has proposed the term \"[[fugue]]\",<ref name=\"samuel-beckett.net\">Grant, S., ''[http://www.samuel-beckett.net/ch4.html Samuel Beckett's Radio Plays: Music of the Absurd]''</ref> an imitative compositional technique, to describe the initial attempts of Joe and Bob to work together. At the very least there is a contrapuntal aspect to the repetitions and echoes that eventually combine in mutual performance. The term fugue may be stretching things a bit but is not far off the mark. At first Joe offers a few words, which Bob tries to present as a [[Phrase (music)|musical phrase]] but soon it's clear that things work better if Joe adds words to Bob's music. Music takes on the role of leader and offers \"suggestions\" as they are described in Beckett's repeated stage directions. In this way they stumble through the construction of the first \"[[aria]]\"<ref>Mercier, V., ''Beckett/Beckett'' (London: Souvenir Press, 1990), p 155</ref> as [[Vivian Mercier]] refers to each of the two short poems, the first of which was published separately as ''Song'' (considering this title \"aria\" may be a bit of an exaggeration) in ''Collected Poems'' (1984).\n\nAfter their initial run through, line-by-line, Bob plays the whole piece and then invites Joe to sing along, which he does his best to. The result is less actual singing than  '[[Sprechgesang|sprechtstimme]].' It is a song about age but it is also about lost love. Perhaps Croak's \"comforts\" are beginning to grasp what their master really needs to hear. \"For the first time Croak [is able to] direct his attention to the subject of the [[Recitation#Rhetoric|recitation]] rather than to its form.\"<ref>Lyons, C. R., ''Samuel Beckett'', MacMillan Modern Dramatists (London: MacMillan Education, 1983), p 137</ref> \"Specifics replace slippery abstractions, the [[Grammatical voice|active replaces the passive voice]] ... clumsy and tentative, Joe has achieved resonance in reaching Croak\u2019s memory.\"<ref name=\"etd.unisa.ac.za\" /> Croak makes no comment whatsoever after they have finished but one senses approval because he opens up an altogether more intimate topic: \"the face\".\n\n===The Face===\n\nBob starts off this time with a \"warmly sentimental\" [[melody]] lasting about a minute.<ref>Beckett, S., ''Collected Shorter Plays of Samuel Beckett'' (London: Faber and Faber, 1984), p 131</ref> Joe's response is poetic enough but his description of the face seen by starlight is presented in \"a cold, rather precise and prosaic\"<ref>Mercier, V., ''Beckett/Beckett'' (London: Souvenir Press, 1990), p 156</ref> manner; old habits die hard. Bob again recommends a softer tone but Joe immediately blurts out the description he believes his master is looking for, (a somewhat oblique one) that of a young man who, having just experienced an [[orgasm]], and taken a moment to gather himself, now looks again on the face of his lover lying together with her in a field of [[rye]].\n\nCroak groans. This is not right. Joe thinks he understands now and tempers his delivery. He describes the woman's \"black disordered hair\"<ref>Beckett, S., ''Collected Shorter Plays of Samuel Beckett'' (London: Faber and Faber, 1984), p 132</ref> and the look of concentration on her face; eyes closed, (Croak calls out in anguish: \"[[Lilium|Lily]]!\"<ref>The lily has long been associated in with death (in both eastern and western culture) and was a popular metaphor with [[John Keats]], a poet Beckett particularly admired. \"I like him best of them all,\" he told MacGreevey \u2013 ''The Faber Companion to Samuel Beckett'', p 297. A comparison of '' La Belle Dame Sans Merci [http://www.bartleby.com/101/633.html]'' \u2013 written while he was dying of [[tuberculosis]] \u2013 with ''Words and Music'' is certainly worthwhile.[http://academic.brooklyn.cuny.edu/english/melani/cs6/belle.html] The flower has also been said to symbolise purity and innocence and, as such, is often associated with the [[Mary (mother of Jesus)|Virgin Mary]] and resurrection and, by extension, motherhood in general and fertility.

Suddenly Bob bursts in and interrupts this scene of coitus at the very point of climax presenting it as a moment of triumph, drowning out Joe's protestations. Like Henry in ''Embers'', Words cannot express what is beyond words, and so, it is up to Music to communicate the climactic moment.\n\nWhen Joe gets to speak again he has calmed down. In a gentle [http://www.thefreedictionary.com/expostulation expostulatory] manner Joe describes the scene as the couple collect themselves before changing his tone to a more poetic one. With the aid of Bob the two compose a second \"aria\"/\"song\" which they perform together as before describing the man's eyes moving down the woman's body toward \"that [http://www.thefreedictionary.com/wellhead wellhead]\".<ref>Beckett, S., ''Collected Shorter Plays of Samuel Beckett'' (London: Faber and Faber, 1984), p 134<br>Commentators avoid saying what they believe \"the wellhead\" to be but considering the definition of the word, there is little doubt Beckett is referring to the [[vulva]], the gateway to the [[womb]] from where all life springs.

R., ''Samuel Beckett'', MacMillan Modern Dramatists (London: MacMillan Education, 1983), pp 136,139</ref> Also a number of times Lyons hints at the autobiographical nature of the piece though without providing any real evidence. It is certainly true that every artist reveals something of himself-whether consciously or not-in whatever he/she produces. \n* John Fletcher refers to Croak as Beckett's \"toppled [[Prospero]] . . . with Words as his [[Caliban (character)|Caliban]] and Music his [[Ariel (Shakespeare)|Ariel]].\"<ref>Fletcher, J., ''Samuel Beckett's Art'' (London: Chatto & Windus, 1967), p 76</ref>\n* Clas Zilliacus proposes that in this play, \"a mental process is unfolding,\" whereby Croak \"instigates two of his faculties, at odds with each other, to provide him with solace and entertainment.\" Zilliacus also offers a view of the play in the light of [[medieval]] lyric, suggesting that the \"master and servant [[Motif (literature)|motif]] familiar from other Beckett works here appears in recognisably [[Feudalism|feudal]] costume\".<ref>Zilliacus, C., ''Beckett and Broadcasting: A Study of the Works of Samuel Beckett for and in Radio and Television'' (\u00c5bo: \u00c5bo Akademi, 1976), pp 105,106</ref>\n* Stefan-Brook Grant reminds us too that, \"''Words and Music'' was a commissioned work from the ''[[BBC Third Programme|Third Programme]]''. Croak, therefore, can be interpreted as the commissioner of the play, while Words is Samuel Beckett's work and Music, John Beckett's. The two instruments, therefore, actually originate from separate sources, and are required to rehearse and combine forces in order to achieve a satisfactory rendering of certain themes.\"<ref name=\"samuel-beckett.net\" />\n\nUltimately most critics agree that Words and Music is a \"composition about composition\".<ref>Cohn, R., ''A Beckett Canon'' (Ann Arbor: University of Michigan Press, 2001), p 168</ref> Of course, a theme running through all of Beckett's writing has been the impossibility of meaningful expression through words alone and, in that respect, Joe doesn\u2019t disappoint. Croak wants to feel. He wants to wallow in a moment, exactly as Krapp does. He doesn\u2019t want to know. He doesn\u2019t need to understand. What is there to understand? Viewed purely as a means of communication, people revert to lovemaking to express their feelings, to \u2018say\u2019 what words can\u2019t say.\n\nIf Croak is a writer, or the personification of the creative aspect of a writer, then he demonstrates precious little control over his thoughts and his feelings. Perhaps he reflects Beckett's own, sometimes agonizing struggles with creativity when it appears at its most uncooperative. When the pair eventually do get their \"act\" together what is produced, which from all accounts is what Croak sought all along, is far too painful for him to bear.\n\n\"Words, in the end, are [Beckett\u2019s] material \u2013 not as literature but in terms of something akin to silence; the desire is not to control or empower but to listen. Words are a function of listening for Beckett, listening within a silence of being where the world is effaced.\"<ref>Finch, M., Book review of ''[http://www.yurulbin.com/mickfinch/beckett.htm Conversations with Samuel Beckett and Bram van Velde]'' by Charles Juliet</ref>\n\nFor Beckett, writing can be equated to seeing, it is a visual art that aspires to the ideal status of music: \"music is the idea itself, unaware of the world of [[Phenomenon#Kant's use of phenomenon|phenomena]]\",<ref>Beckett, S., ''Proust'' (London: Calder, 1958), p 92</ref> \"the ultimate imageless language of emotion.\"<ref>Sion, I., \u2018[http://www.aber.ac.uk/cla/archive/sion.html The Shape of the Beckettian Self: Godot and the Jungian Mandala]\u2019 in ''Consciousness, Literature and the Arts'', Vol. 7 No. 1, April 2006</ref> It is not so surprising then, when Katharine Worth asked Beckett about the relationship between the two figures in this radio play, he said: \"Music always wins.\"<ref>Worth, K., \u2018Beckett and the Radio Medium\u2019 in Drakakis, J., (Ed.) ''British Radio Drama''\u2019 (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1981), p 210</ref> Similarly, Beckett told [[Theodor W. Adorno]] \"that it definitely ends with the victory of music\".<ref>Zilliacus, C., ''Beckett and Broadcasting: A Study of the Works of Samuel Beckett for and in Radio and Television'' (\u00c5bo, \u00c5bo Akademi, 1976), p 114</ref> In what way though? They struggle together to get to this point but is it meaning that has finally overpowered Croak or is it his reawakened feelings? Is this why Words are rendered speechless by the play's end?\n\n===Music===\n\nConsidering the importance Beckett places on the role of music in this play, it is worthwhile looking at how three of his collaborations were handled.\n\n\"The concerns of Words and Music are clearly related to Beckett\u2019s general preoccupation with the limitations of the expressive powers of language. However, the fact that the music could not be composed by Beckett and therefore changes with the individual composer involved in each production has always rendered the word-music opposition, and hence the play as a whole, somewhat problematic. Beckett gives some instructions to the composer regarding the character of the music (asking for responses to specific concepts \u2013 \u2018Love\u2019, \u2018Age\u2019 and \u2018Face\u2019 \u2013 and demanding music of \u2018great expression\u2019, \u2018Love and soul music\u2019 and \u2018spreading and subsiding music\u2019), but this gives no indication of style or material content.\"<ref>Laws, C., \u2018Music In Words And Music: Feldman\u2019s Response to Beckett\u2019s ''Play''\u2019 in Moorjani, A. and Veit, C., (Eds.) ''Samuel Beckett Today/Aujourd'hui, Samuel Beckett: Endlessness in the Year 2000'' (Amsterdam: Rodopi, 2001), p 279</ref>\n\nWhat is perhaps most amazing is the lack of input Beckett chose to have. According to James Knowlson, \"John Beckett \u2026 wrote his music for [this] play, totally independently of Beckett.\"<ref>Knowlson, J., ''Damned to Fame: The Life of Samuel Beckett'' (London: Bloomsbury, 1996), p 497</ref> Beckett's conversation with Everett Frost, who directed the play in the 1980s, sheds a slightly different light on things: \"Beckett apologised that, now at an advanced age and increasingly in poor health, he felt unable to enter once again into the kind of collaborative or consultative effort that he had once given his cousin, John.<ref>Beckett in conversation with Everett Frost. Quoted in Frost E.

''Samuel Beckett and Music'' (New York: Oxford University Press, 1998), p 47</ref>\n\nIrrespective of how much support he did or did not get, John became diffident about his score (despite it having pleased Beckett at the time) and, when Katharine Worth asked his permission to use it in a later production she was politely told \"that he had withdrawn it.\"<ref>Worth, K., \u2018Words for Music Perhaps\u2019 in Bryden, M., (Ed.) ''Samuel Beckett and Music'' (New York: Oxford University Press, 1998), p 11</ref>\n\n: \"I liked its austerity,\" she said, \"and touches such as a faint suggestion of [[plainsong]], which picked up the quasi-medieval notes in the text.

''Samuel Beckett and Music'' (New York: Oxford University Press, 1998), p 12</ref>\n\nWorth approached Samuel Beckett to see \"if there was any composer he would care to recommend; he suggested [[Humphrey Searle]]\",<ref name=\"Worth, K. 1998 p 12\" /> one of the UK's foremost pioneers of [[Serialism|serial music]] (whom he had met once in [[Paris]]<ref>Worth, K., \u2018Words for Music Perhaps\u2019 in Bryden, M., (Ed.) ''Samuel Beckett and Music'' (New York: Oxford University Press, 1998), p 12 fn 2</ref>), as a suitable replacement. Much to her surprise, Beckett expressed no pressing need to meet up with him to discuss approaches. \"This seemed interestingly,\" she writes, \"different from the degree of control he had been known to exert over directors and designers.\"<ref>Worth, K., \u2018Words for Music Perhaps\u2019 in Bryden, M., (Ed.) ''Samuel Beckett and Music'' (New York: Oxford University Press, 1998), p 13</ref>\n\nFor many years the version most readily available on CD, has been [[Morton Feldman]]\u2019s, written in 1987. \"The two men had met in [[Berlin]] in 1976. Feldman wanted to do something with Beckett for the [[Teatro dell'Opera di Roma|Rome Opera]]. Beckett indicated that he didn\u2019t like [[opera]] \u2013 and Feldman agreed. Out of this understanding grew the collaboration on ''Neither'' (1977), and Beckett's pleasure with that work accounts for the fact that he recommended Feldman for the music of ''Words and Music'' ten years later.\"<ref>Strauss, W. A., review of Bryden, M., (Ed.) [http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/substance/v029/29.2strauss.html Samuel Beckett and Music (New York: Oxford University Press, 1998)] in ''SubStance'' 29.2, 2000 pp 106,107</ref> The noteworthy thing is that when Beckett sent the text of ''Neither'' to Feldman he had never heard any of the composer's music.\n\nFeldman's idiom is slow, shapeless and tentative; his mastery lies in \"probing\" sound; its material and sensuous characteristics, the haunting suggestion that his notes are surrounded by silences. This alone brings him into the Beckettian domain. In an interview Feldman stated:\n\n: \"I never liked anyone else's approach to Beckett. I felt it was a little too easy; they were treating him as if he were an [[Existentialism|existentialist]] hero, rather than a [[tragic hero]]. And he's a word man, a fantastic word man. And I always felt that I was a note man. I think that's what brought me to him. A kind of shared longing: this saturated, unending longing that he has, and that I have.\"<ref>Frost E. C., \u2018[http://www.cnvill.demon.co.uk/mfefrost.htm The Note Man and the Word Man: An Interview with Morton Feldman about Composing the Music for Samuel Beckett's Radio Play, Words and Music]\u2019 in Bryden, M., (Ed.) ''Samuel Beckett and Music'' (New York: Oxford University Press, 1998), p 51</ref>\n\nCreating a character whose sole means of expression approximates dialogue/response to others through musical gestures is enormously challenging and fascinating. Perhaps future composers might consider imagined text responses as a starting point to approximate speech more overtly if this is deemed appropriate and useful. The tendency of Feldman to be somewhat long-winded and expansive perhaps does not ideally balance the brevity of speech and stretches things out a bit needlessly. Any musical decisions for this play are truly daunting with the lack of specificity as to how to achieve the \"best\" results. The scalar approach Feldman uses has great discipline and a certain hypnotic quality but it also may be a bit predictable and overly simple a vocabulary for such a complex and enigmatic work.\n\nThe unusual use of music in the play and the conceptual nature of Words/Music as \"characters\" sets up a difficult to achieve convention. One might say that Music delivers a form of \"line\" with each iteration as part of its/his \"character function.\" The challenges Beckett sets up for the composer are manifold. He ascribes attitudes, intentions  and interpersonal relating to Music that stretch the \"normal\" parameters of what music can achieve as a form of expression. Perhaps the point where music and text meet and become the same thing/interchangeable  was the place Beckett sought in most of his writing endeavors. Certainly that is a goal to be sought in \"Words and Music.\" It is appropriate to think of Beckett as coming as close to a combined \"composer/writer\" as any author has or perhaps ever will. Beckett's impossible yet thrilling and inspiring lifelong search (technical and otherwise) resulted in a body of brilliant works that still puzzle and amaze no matter how much analysis is applied to them.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*[http://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/rodopi/sbta/2002/00000011/00000001/art00033 A PDF version of Catherine Law\u2019s detailed article, ''Words and Music: Feldman\u2019s Response to Beckett\u2019s Play'' can be downloaded from Ingenta\u2019s website]\n*[http://www.themodernword.com/beckett/beckett_feldman_wam.html Apmonia\u2019s website contains an extensive article on this piece concentrating heavily on Feldman\u2019s version]\n*[http://www.thetheaterofthemind.com/WordsMusic-OrchestralVersion.mp3 MP3 of the play performed as a one-person show \u2013 Theatre of the Mind (orchestral version)]\n*[http://www.thetheaterofthemind.com/WordsMusic.mp3 MP3 of the play performed as a one-person show \u2013 Theatre of the Mind (piano version])\n*[http://ubu.wfmu.org/sound/beckett_samuel/theatre_pieces/Beckett-Samuel_Theatre-For-Your-Mother_Words+Music.mp3 MP3 of the play (Theatre for Your Mother)]\n*[http://samuel-beckett.net/WordsMusic3.html Text of the play (Samuel-Beckett.net)]\n\n{{Beckett}}\n\n[[Category:1962 plays]]\n[[Category:Theatre of the Absurd]]\n[[Category:Plays by Samuel Beckett]]\n[[Category:Works originally published in Evergreen Review]]\n", "text_old": "{{italic title}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=August 2013}}\n{{Use British English|date=August 2013}}\n[[Samuel Beckett]] wrote the radio play, '''''Words and Music''''' between November and December 1961.<ref>Both James Knowlson (''Damned to Fame: The Life of Samuel Beckett'', p 497) and Stan Gontarski (''The Faber Companion to Samuel Beckett'', p 650) quote these dates however, [[Deirdre Bair]], stipulates that the text of the play was completed \"by 20th November, the date [Beckett] affixed at the end of the manuscript.\" \u2013 Bair, D., ''Samuel Beckett: A Biography'' (London: Vintage, 1990), p 571</ref> It was recorded and broadcast on the [[BBC]] [[BBC Third Programme|Third Programme]] on 13 November 1962.

The suicidal man in ''Rough for Theatre II'' is named Croker.</ref> is a doddery old man, testy and maudlin. He is never referred to by name in the play itself but he is well named. Joe addresses to him \u2013 albeit somewhat obsequiously \u2013 as, \"My Lord,\" since, despite his apparent frailty, he has plainly been someone used to wielding authority. There are only three sound effects used in the entire play, the shuffle [Beckett's descriptive stage direction) of Croak's feet as he arrives and departs, the thud/dropping of his [[Club (weapon)|club]] (staff?) reminiscent of the rulers wielded by the [[Rough for Radio II#Animator|Animator]] in ''[[Rough for Radio II]]'' and the music teacher in ''[[Embers]]'' and the rapping of Music's baton reminiscent of a once prevalent practice among conductors of the past which is now far less widespread. The club and baton function as objects of authority. They form an interesting dyad prominently employed throughout the play.\n\nFor entertainment, Croak, (a Beckettian \u2018[[old King Cole]]\u2019) has only two old stalwarts to call on, his [[minstrel]]s, Joe (Words) and Bob (Music). Each is heard to be possibly an abstraction and/or a being of some sort manifested through their respective vocabularies (music/words). Do they have actual physical form? This remains an unanswerable question. With radio remaining a solely sonic medium, we can only conjecture (Beckett sets up similar uncertainty in much of his work). Words/Music function in a way resembling court artists/musicians of the past. Word's repeatedly addressing Croak as \"My Lord\" and the strange formality to the domination both Words/Joe and Music/Bob seem accustomed to enduring adds an ancient (medieval?) or primitively regal aspect to the proceedings.\n\nThe modern shortened names (Joe, Bob) add a humorous contemporary contrast to the generally ancient (or timeless) seeming circumstances. The source of Croak's power over them is never explained or questioned-adding to the mysterious atmosphere.\n\n[[Al Alvarez|Alfred Alvarez]] refers to Croak as \"a poet\"<ref>Alvarez, A., ''Samuel Beckett'' (New York: Viking Press, 1973), p 119</ref> though there is no real evidence to suggest that he is. In fact his utterances throughout the play are terse: moans, groans and murmurings mainly along with a few short lines (commands, entreaties or outbursts). That said, he appears to appreciate poetry especially when set to music. The first theme Croak proclaims for the evening's diversion is \"Love.\" Beckett offers several clues to help imagine Croak as a specific character. His shuffling feet, choice of themes, self-torturing reminiscence and intense reactions to much of what Words and Music produce/perform all seem to indicate that he is a decrepit version of [[Twelfth Night, or What You Will#List of characters|Orsino]] with his famous opening line from [[Twelfth Night, or What You Will|Twelfth Night]]: \"If music be the food of love, play on,\"<ref>Shakespeare, W., ''Twelfth Night'' (Act 1, Scene 1)</ref> a hopeless romantic, in love with love, and the melancholy brought on by the mere thought of it. Croak could almost be the selfsame man, had he never moved from that spot for the rest of his life and now finds himself perhaps approaching the brink of death. Or does this gathering occur again and again outside time? So many Beckett works present characters seemingly caught in endless cycles of repetition (those who wait in \"Waiting for Godot\"/the appearing-disappearing woman in \"Ill Seen Ill Said\"/The urn-dwelling trio in \"Play\" etc.) that this is always a possibility.\n\nAdditional related aspects of Love that Croak focuses on as sub-themes are \"Age,\" \"Face,\" (With two foreshadowing mentions earlier on in the play-once by Croak and then latter by Words) and the climactic naming of \"Lily\" which is discussed later regarding its various implications. After this iteration Croak is reduced to groans, an anguished \"No!\" and the eventual dropping of his \"club\" followed by shuffling away. His entrance/exit frames the main body of the play.\n\n===Prelude===\n\nThe going is not easy; from the very beginning it's obvious that Words and Music do not enjoy each other's company. The play opens with Music \u2013 a small orchestra \u2013 tuning up much to the irritation of Words who is trying to rehearse a [[Monologue|soliloquy]] on the unlikely theme of [[Sloth (deadly sin)|sloth]]. The orchestra interrupts him in the middle of his speech and again at the end when he's straining to hear if their master is approaching. Squabbling servants appear often in the works of [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]] summoning another parallel. Joe is much like [[Malvolio]], the strait-laced, pompous steward in the household of [[Twelfth Night, or What You Will#List of characters|Lady Olivia]], efficient but also self-righteous, with a poor opinion of drinking, singing, and fun. His priggishness and haughty attitude earn him the enmity of [[Twelfth Night, or What You Will#List of characters|Maria]], Olivia's sharp-witted waiting-gentlewoman. There are moments of jealousy and competitiveness between Words and Music that seem at times relatively overt, adding dimension to their relationship.\n\nCroak shuffles into the room and Joe and Bob both become habitually subservient. They\u2019ve probably been together for a great many years, like [[Hamm (character)|Hamm]] and [[Clov]], and rubbing each other the wrong way has become a means of entertaining themselves when they\u2019re not performing for their master. They could be viewed as prisoners who cannot escape torturing one another. Croak realizes they will have been bickering and gently reproves them: \"My comforts! Be friends.\"<ref>Beckett, S., ''Collected Shorter Plays of Samuel Beckett'' (London: Faber and Faber, 1984), p 127</ref> He apologises for being late and offers a vague excuse: \"The face \u2026 On the stairs \u2026 In the tower.\"<ref>Beckett, S., ''Collected Shorter Plays of Samuel Beckett'' (London: Faber and Faber, 1984), pp 127,128</ref> He apparently doesn\u2019t need to explain further. \"The face\" will be taken up later on and bring Croak added anguish. He seems magnanimous at first but soon enough reveals his impatience, condescension, tyranny and raging.\n\n===Love===\n\nCroak considers for a moment and then announces the primary theme for the night's entertainment: Love. He calls for his club and thumps it on the ground: \"Love!\" We now realise that Joe may have been mocking the old man in his earlier [http://www.thefreedictionary.com/disquisition disquisition] on sloth. The speech he delivers is practically identical to the one he was rehearsing before when the play opens; he has simply swapped \u2018sloth\u2019 with \u2018love\u2019. It is empty [[rhetoric]]. At one point he even stumbles and says \u2018sloth\u2019 by mistake. The feeling is that it wouldn\u2019t matter what the theme chosen was ''this'' was the speech he was intending to deliver: \"\u2018one-size-fits-all\u2019 [http://www.thefreedictionary.com/verbiage verbiage]\" \u2026 [[Polonius]] could not have done better.\"<ref name=\"etd.unisa.ac.za\">Brown, V., ''[http://etd.unisa.ac.za/ETD-db/theses/available/etd-03022006-154713/unrestricted/thesis.pdf Yesterday\u2019s Deformities: A Discussion of the Role of Memory and Discourse in the Plays of Samuel Beckett]'', (doctoral thesis)</ref> Croak is displeased and calls on Bob to offer his sounds based on the theme-his \"interpretation,\" if you will. Croak is still unhappy and wants the music louder. Joe interrupts, overstepping the mark with a [[jester]]\u2019s [http://www.thefreedictionary.com/veracity veracity]: \"What? Is love the word? \u2026 Is soul the word? \u2026 Do we mean love when we say love? \u2026 Soul, when we say soul? \u2026 Do we? \u2026 Or don\u2019t we?\"\n\nCroak finally cries out for Bob's assistance and the recital turns into a shambles.\n\nOnce everything has calmed down he sets a new topic: Age.\n\n===Age===\n\nJoe's words are nowhere near as eloquent here. He had prepared one speech and now has to [[Improvisation|improvise]] a second. Does his master mean ''old'' age? He's not sure. His speech falters and Croak doesn\u2019t put up with him for long. It's unclear if he is trying to mimic an old man's speech pattern or if he has genuinely been caught off guard. Bob's music is also endured for only a short time. Croak's solution is a simple one, force the rivals to work together. They object but acquiesce.\n\nStefan-Brook Grant has proposed the term \"[[fugue]]\",<ref name=\"samuel-beckett.net\">Grant, S., ''[http://www.samuel-beckett.net/ch4.html Samuel Beckett's Radio Plays: Music of the Absurd]''</ref> an imitative compositional technique, to describe the initial attempts of Joe and Bob to work together. At the very least there is a contrapuntal aspect to the repetitions and echoes that eventually combine in mutual performance. The term fugue may be stretching things a bit but is not far off the mark. At first Joe offers a few words, which Bob tries to present as a [[Phrase (music)|musical phrase]] but soon it's clear that things work better if Joe adds words to Bob's music. Music takes on the role of leader and offers \"suggestions\" as they are described in Beckett's repeated stage directions. In this way they stumble through the construction of the first \"[[aria]]\"<ref>Mercier, V., ''Beckett/Beckett'' (London: Souvenir Press, 1990), p 155</ref> as [[Vivian Mercier]] refers to each of the two short poems, the first of which was published separately as ''Song'' (considering this title \"aria\" may be a bit of an exaggeration) in ''Collected Poems'' (1984).\n\nAfter their initial run through, line-by-line, Bob plays the whole piece and then invites Joe to sing along, which he does his best to. The result is less actual singing than  '[[Sprechgesang|sprechtstimme]].' It is a song about age but it is also about lost love. Perhaps Croak's \"comforts\" are beginning to grasp what their master really needs to hear. \"For the first time Croak [is able to] direct his attention to the subject of the [[Recitation#Rhetoric|recitation]] rather than to its form.\"<ref>Lyons, C. R., ''Samuel Beckett'', MacMillan Modern Dramatists (London: MacMillan Education, 1983), p 137</ref> \"Specifics replace slippery abstractions, the [[Grammatical voice|active replaces the passive voice]] ... clumsy and tentative, Joe has achieved resonance in reaching Croak\u2019s memory.\"<ref name=\"etd.unisa.ac.za\" /> Croak makes no comment whatsoever after they have finished but one senses approval because he opens up an altogether more intimate topic: \"the face\".\n\n===The Face===\n\nBob starts off this time with a \"warmly sentimental\" [[melody]] lasting about a minute.<ref>Beckett, S., ''Collected Shorter Plays of Samuel Beckett'' (London: Faber and Faber, 1984), p 131</ref> Joe's response is poetic enough but his description of the face seen by starlight is presented in \"a cold, rather precise and prosaic\"<ref>Mercier, V., ''Beckett/Beckett'' (London: Souvenir Press, 1990), p 156</ref> manner; old habits die hard. Bob again recommends a softer tone but Joe immediately blurts out the description he believes his master is looking for, (a somewhat oblique one) that of a young man who, having just experienced an [[orgasm]], and taken a moment to gather himself, now looks again on the face of his lover lying together with her in a field of [[rye]].\n\nCroak groans. This is not right. Joe thinks he understands now and tempers his delivery. He describes the woman's \"black disordered hair\"<ref>Beckett, S., ''Collected Shorter Plays of Samuel Beckett'' (London: Faber and Faber, 1984), p 132</ref> and the look of concentration on her face; eyes closed, (Croak calls out in anguish: \"[[Lilium|Lily]]!\"<ref>The lily has long been associated in with death (in both eastern and western culture) and was a popular metaphor with [[John Keats]], a poet Beckett particularly admired. \"I like him best of them all,\" he told MacGreevey \u2013 ''The Faber Companion to Samuel Beckett'', p 297. A comparison of '' La Belle Dame Sans Merci [http://www.bartleby.com/101/633.html]'' \u2013 written while he was dying of [[tuberculosis]] \u2013 with ''Words and Music'' is certainly worthwhile.[http://academic.brooklyn.cuny.edu/english/melani/cs6/belle.html] The flower has also been said to symbolise purity and innocence and, as such, is often associated with the [[Mary (mother of Jesus)|Virgin Mary]] and resurrection and, by extension, motherhood in general and fertility. The flower became especially popular with artists after [[Sigmund Freud|Freud]] provided a sexual interpretation of its form that added new levels of meaning to depictions of it (Freud, S., ''Symbolism in Dreams'', pp 163,164).</ref>) breasts heaving, biting her lip \u2013 she is in the throes of ecstasy. Suddenly Bob bursts in and interrupts this scene of coitus at the very point of climax presenting it as a moment of triumph, drowning out Joe's protestations. Like Henry in ''Embers'', Words cannot express what is beyond words, and so, it is up to Music to communicate the climactic moment.\n\nWhen Joe gets to speak again he has calmed down. In a gentle [http://www.thefreedictionary.com/expostulation expostulatory] manner Joe describes the scene as the couple collect themselves before changing his tone to a more poetic one. With the aid of Bob the two compose a second \"aria\"/\"song\" which they perform together as before describing the man's eyes moving down the woman's body toward \"that [http://www.thefreedictionary.com/wellhead wellhead]\".<ref>Beckett, S., ''Collected Shorter Plays of Samuel Beckett'' (London: Faber and Faber, 1984), p 134<br>Commentators avoid saying what they believe \"the wellhead\" to be but considering the definition of the word, there is little doubt Beckett is referring to the [[vulva]], the gateway to the [[womb]] from where all life springs. (Compare [[Leonard Cohen]]\u2019s song, ''Light as The Breeze'' [http://www.leonardcohenfiles.com/album10.html])</ref> \"One glimpse of \"that wellhead\" of another being's inmost [[Being]], down there beyond the opened eyes \u2013 that is the most [Beckett's] heroes can even gain and, having gained, forever try to recapture\"<ref>Esslin, M., \u2018Patterns of Rejection: Sex and Love in Beckett\u2019s Universe\u2019 in Ben-Zvi, L., (Ed.)

The play ends with what we might perceive to be our own natural non-rational and immediate expression of hopelessness; the word is reduced to a human sigh in the play's concluding sound.\"<ref name=\"samuel-beckett.net\" />\n\n==Interpretation==\n\nVarious readings of what the situation in ''Words and Music'' might represent have emerged from critical studies of the work:\n\n*Vivian Mercier treats the three characters as separate beings, Croak being an \"old man who shuffles in\" asking Words and Music to be friends.<ref>Mercier, V., ''Beckett/Beckett'' (New York: Oxford University Press, 1977), p 154-159</ref>\n* Eugene Webb suggests that \"Croak is the name the dialogue directions give to the [[Self (psychology)|conscious self]] of the artist\".<ref>Webb, E., ''The Plays of Samuel Beckett'' (London: Peter Owen, 1972), p 102</ref>\n* Charles Lyons says that \"[i]n ''Words and Music'' Beckett provides three characters who seem to represent different [[Mind|psychic]] functions of a single consciousness \u2026 [however] Beckett does not integrate them into the image of a specific, whole [[person]].\"<ref>Lyons, C. R., ''Samuel Beckett'', MacMillan Modern Dramatists (London: MacMillan Education, 1983), pp 136,139</ref> Also a number of times Lyons hints at the autobiographical nature of the piece though without providing any real evidence. It is certainly true that every artist reveals something of himself-whether consciously or not-in whatever he/she produces. \n* John Fletcher refers to Croak as Beckett's \"toppled [[Prospero]] . . . with Words as his [[Caliban (character)|Caliban]] and Music his [[Ariel (Shakespeare)|Ariel]].\"<ref>Fletcher, J., ''Samuel Beckett's Art'' (London: Chatto & Windus, 1967), p 76</ref>\n* Clas Zilliacus proposes that in this play, \"a mental process is unfolding,\" whereby Croak \"instigates two of his faculties, at odds with each other, to provide him with solace and entertainment.\" Zilliacus also offers a view of the play in the light of [[medieval]] lyric, suggesting that the \"master and servant [[Motif (literature)|motif]] familiar from other Beckett works here appears in recognisably [[Feudalism|feudal]] costume\".<ref>Zilliacus, C., ''Beckett and Broadcasting: A Study of the Works of Samuel Beckett for and in Radio and Television'' (\u00c5bo: \u00c5bo Akademi, 1976), pp 105,106</ref>\n* Stefan-Brook Grant reminds us too that, \"''Words and Music'' was a commissioned work from the ''[[BBC Third Programme|Third Programme]]''. Croak, therefore, can be interpreted as the commissioner of the play, while Words is Samuel Beckett's work and Music, John Beckett's. The two instruments, therefore, actually originate from separate sources, and are required to rehearse and combine forces in order to achieve a satisfactory rendering of certain themes.\"<ref name=\"samuel-beckett.net\" />\n\nUltimately most critics agree that Words and Music is a \"composition about composition\".<ref>Cohn, R., ''A Beckett Canon'' (Ann Arbor: University of Michigan Press, 2001), p 168</ref> Of course, a theme running through all of Beckett's writing has been the impossibility of meaningful expression through words alone and, in that respect, Joe doesn\u2019t disappoint. Croak wants to feel. He wants to wallow in a moment, exactly as Krapp does. He doesn\u2019t want to know. He doesn\u2019t need to understand. What is there to understand? Viewed purely as a means of communication, people revert to lovemaking to express their feelings, to \u2018say\u2019 what words can\u2019t say.\n\nIf Croak is a writer, or the personification of the creative aspect of a writer, then he demonstrates precious little control over his thoughts and his feelings. Perhaps he reflects Beckett's own, sometimes agonizing struggles with creativity when it appears at its most uncooperative. When the pair eventually do get their \"act\" together what is produced, which from all accounts is what Croak sought all along, is far too painful for him to bear.\n\n\"Words, in the end, are [Beckett\u2019s] material \u2013 not as literature but in terms of something akin to silence; the desire is not to control or empower but to listen. Words are a function of listening for Beckett, listening within a silence of being where the world is effaced.\"<ref>Finch, M., Book review of ''[http://www.yurulbin.com/mickfinch/beckett.htm Conversations with Samuel Beckett and Bram van Velde]'' by Charles Juliet</ref>\n\nFor Beckett, writing can be equated to seeing, it is a visual art that aspires to the ideal status of music: \"music is the idea itself, unaware of the world of [[Phenomenon#Kant's use of phenomenon|phenomena]]\",<ref>Beckett, S., ''Proust'' (London: Calder, 1958), p 92</ref> \"the ultimate imageless language of emotion.\"<ref>Sion, I., \u2018[http://www.aber.ac.uk/cla/archive/sion.html The Shape of the Beckettian Self: Godot and the Jungian Mandala]\u2019 in ''Consciousness, Literature and the Arts'', Vol. 7 No. 1, April 2006</ref> It is not so surprising then, when Katharine Worth asked Beckett about the relationship between the two figures in this radio play, he said: \"Music always wins.\"<ref>Worth, K., \u2018Beckett and the Radio Medium\u2019 in Drakakis, J., (Ed.) ''British Radio Drama''\u2019 (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1981), p 210</ref> Similarly, Beckett told [[Theodor W. Adorno]] \"that it definitely ends with the victory of music\".<ref>Zilliacus, C., ''Beckett and Broadcasting: A Study of the Works of Samuel Beckett for and in Radio and Television'' (\u00c5bo, \u00c5bo Akademi, 1976), p 114</ref> In what way though? They struggle together to get to this point but is it meaning that has finally overpowered Croak or is it his reawakened feelings? Is this why Words are rendered speechless by the play's end?\n\n===Music===\n\nConsidering the importance Beckett places on the role of music in this play, it is worthwhile looking at how three of his collaborations were handled.\n\n\"The concerns of Words and Music are clearly related to Beckett\u2019s general preoccupation with the limitations of the expressive powers of language. However, the fact that the music could not be composed by Beckett and therefore changes with the individual composer involved in each production has always rendered the word-music opposition, and hence the play as a whole, somewhat problematic. Beckett gives some instructions to the composer regarding the character of the music (asking for responses to specific concepts \u2013 \u2018Love\u2019, \u2018Age\u2019 and \u2018Face\u2019 \u2013 and demanding music of \u2018great expression\u2019, \u2018Love and soul music\u2019 and \u2018spreading and subsiding music\u2019), but this gives no indication of style or material content.\"<ref>Laws, C., \u2018Music In Words And Music: Feldman\u2019s Response to Beckett\u2019s ''Play''\u2019 in Moorjani, A. and Veit, C., (Eds.) ''Samuel Beckett Today/Aujourd'hui, Samuel Beckett: Endlessness in the Year 2000'' (Amsterdam: Rodopi, 2001), p 279</ref>\n\nWhat is perhaps most amazing is the lack of input Beckett chose to have. According to James Knowlson, \"John Beckett \u2026 wrote his music for [this] play, totally independently of Beckett.\"<ref>Knowlson, J., ''Damned to Fame: The Life of Samuel Beckett'' (London: Bloomsbury, 1996), p 497</ref> Beckett's conversation with Everett Frost, who directed the play in the 1980s, sheds a slightly different light on things: \"Beckett apologised that, now at an advanced age and increasingly in poor health, he felt unable to enter once again into the kind of collaborative or consultative effort that he had once given his cousin, John.<ref>Beckett in conversation with Everett Frost. Quoted in Frost E.

''Samuel Beckett and Music'' (New York: Oxford University Press, 1998), p 47</ref>\n\nIrrespective of how much support he did or did not get, John became diffident about his score (despite it having pleased Beckett at the time) and, when Katharine Worth asked his permission to use it in a later production she was politely told \"that he had withdrawn it.\"<ref>Worth, K., \u2018Words for Music Perhaps\u2019 in Bryden, M., (Ed.) ''Samuel Beckett and Music'' (New York: Oxford University Press, 1998), p 11</ref>\n\n: \"I liked its austerity,\" she said, \"and touches such as a faint suggestion of [[plainsong]], which picked up the quasi-medieval notes in the text.

''Samuel Beckett and Music'' (New York: Oxford University Press, 1998), p 12</ref>\n\nWorth approached Samuel Beckett to see \"if there was any composer he would care to recommend; he suggested [[Humphrey Searle]]\",<ref name=\"Worth, K. 1998 p 12\" /> one of the UK's foremost pioneers of [[Serialism|serial music]] (whom he had met once in [[Paris]]<ref>Worth, K., \u2018Words for Music Perhaps\u2019 in Bryden, M., (Ed.) ''Samuel Beckett and Music'' (New York: Oxford University Press, 1998), p 12 fn 2</ref>), as a suitable replacement. Much to her surprise, Beckett expressed no pressing need to meet up with him to discuss approaches. \"This seemed interestingly,\" she writes, \"different from the degree of control he had been known to exert over directors and designers.\"<ref>Worth, K., \u2018Words for Music Perhaps\u2019 in Bryden, M., (Ed.) ''Samuel Beckett and Music'' (New York: Oxford University Press, 1998), p 13</ref>\n\nFor many years the version most readily available on CD, has been [[Morton Feldman]]\u2019s, written in 1987. \"The two men had met in [[Berlin]] in 1976. Feldman wanted to do something with Beckett for the [[Teatro dell'Opera di Roma|Rome Opera]]. Beckett indicated that he didn\u2019t like [[opera]] \u2013 and Feldman agreed. Out of this understanding grew the collaboration on ''Neither'' (1977), and Beckett's pleasure with that work accounts for the fact that he recommended Feldman for the music of ''Words and Music'' ten years later.\"<ref>Strauss, W. A., review of Bryden, M., (Ed.) [http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/substance/v029/29.2strauss.html Samuel Beckett and Music (New York: Oxford University Press, 1998)] in ''SubStance'' 29.2, 2000 pp 106,107</ref> The noteworthy thing is that when Beckett sent the text of ''Neither'' to Feldman he had never heard any of the composer's music.\n\nFeldman's idiom is slow, shapeless and tentative; his mastery lies in \"probing\" sound; its material and sensuous characteristics, the haunting suggestion that his notes are surrounded by silences. This alone brings him into the Beckettian domain. In an interview Feldman stated:\n\n: \"I never liked anyone else's approach to Beckett. I felt it was a little too easy; they were treating him as if he were an [[Existentialism|existentialist]] hero, rather than a [[tragic hero]]. And he's a word man, a fantastic word man. And I always felt that I was a note man. I think that's what brought me to him. A kind of shared longing: this saturated, unending longing that he has, and that I have.\"<ref>Frost E. C., \u2018[http://www.cnvill.demon.co.uk/mfefrost.htm The Note Man and the Word Man: An Interview with Morton Feldman about Composing the Music for Samuel Beckett's Radio Play, Words and Music]\u2019 in Bryden, M., (Ed.) ''Samuel Beckett and Music'' (New York: Oxford University Press, 1998), p 51</ref>\n\nCreating a character whose sole means of expression approximates dialogue/response to others through musical gestures is enormously challenging and fascinating. Perhaps future composers might consider imagined text responses as a starting point to approximate speech more overtly if this is deemed appropriate and useful. The tendency of Feldman to be somewhat long-winded and expansive perhaps does not ideally balance the brevity of speech and stretches things out a bit needlessly. Any musical decisions for this play are truly daunting with the lack of specificity as to how to achieve the \"best\" results. The scalar approach Feldman uses has great discipline and a certain hypnotic quality but it also may be a bit predictable and overly simple a vocabulary for such a complex and enigmatic work.\n\nThe unusual use of music in the play and the conceptual nature of Words/Music as \"characters\" sets up a difficult to achieve convention. One might say that Music delivers a form of \"line\" with each iteration as part of its/his \"character function.\" The challenges Beckett sets up for the composer are manifold. He ascribes attitudes, intentions  and interpersonal relating to Music that stretch the \"normal\" parameters of what music can achieve as a form of expression. Perhaps the point where music and text meet and become the same thing/interchangeable  was the place Beckett sought in most of his writing endeavors.

The work takes its title from the [[Lutheran hymn]] \"{{lang|de|[[Jesu, meine Freude]]|italic=no}}\", with poetry by [[Johann Franck]] and a [[Chorale|chorale melody]] by [[Johann Cr\u00fcger]]. [[Movement (music)|Movements]] based on the six [[stanza]]s of the hymn are interspersed with five movements based on passages from the [[Epistle to the Romans]]. The Biblical text, which contains key [[Lutheranism|Lutheran]] teaching, is contrasted by the hymn, written in the first person with a focus on emotion, and Bach set both with attention to dramatic detail {{sfn|Eckerson|2020}} in a symmetrical structure of eleven movements. Bach set the [[chorale]] tune in various ways, from a four-part setting which begins and ends the work, to a [[chorale fantasia]] and a free setting which only paraphrases the tune. Four verses from the Epistle are set in [[motet]] style, two four five voices, and two for three voices. The central movement is a five-part [[Fugue (music)|fugue]].  Bach used [[word painting]] to intensify the theological meaning of both hymn and Epistle texts.\n\n{{lang|de|Jesu, meine Freude}} is one of few works by Bach for five vocal parts. It may have been composed for a funeral, but scholars doubt a 1912 dating to a specific funeral in Leipzig on 18 July 1723. Chorale settings from the motet were included in the [[Dietel manuscript]], a collection of Bach's chorales from {{circa|1735}}. At least one of the eleven movements seems to date to a period before Bach's post in Leipzig. [[Christoph Wolff]] suggested that it may have been composed for education in both choral singing and theology. The motet, unique in its complex symmetrical structure juxtaposing hymn text and Bible text, has been regarded as one of Bach's greatest motets.{{sfn|Cookson|2010}} It was the first of his motets to be recorded, in 1927.\n{{TOC limit|3}}\n\n== History ==\n[[File:Jesu Meine Freude Praxis Cruger 1653.jpeg|thumb|upright|\"{{lang|de|[[Jesu, meine Freude]]|italic=no}}\" in Johann Cr\u00fcger's ''[[Praxis pietatis melica]]'', 1653]]\nIn the context of late 17th-century [[Protestantism|Protestant]] Germany, where and when [[Johann Sebastian Bach]]'s ancestors composed their motets\u2014a collection of which was preserved in the {{lang|de|[[Altbachisches Archiv]]}}\u2014, motets were choral compositions, mostly with a number of independent voices exceeding that of a standard [[SATB]] choir, and with a text from sacred scripture and/or based on a [[Lutheran hymn]]. In the latter case, the [[Lutheran chorale|corresponding chorale tune]] was usually adopted into the composition. Instrumental accompaniment was often limited to [[basso continuo]] and/or instruments playing ''[[colla parte]]''. By the time Bach started to compose [[Motet (Bach)|his motets]] along these principles in the 1810s or 1820s, motets were regarded an antiquated genre. Bach composed most of [[church cantata (Bach)|his church cantatas]] for occasions of the [[Liturgical calendar (Lutheran)|Lutheran liturgical calendar]] of the time and place where he was occupied. Church cantatas for weddings and funerals fall outside such scheme, and also his motets appear to belong in this latter category.{{sfn|Cookson|2010}}\n\nAmong around 15 extant compositions which at some point or another were designated as a motet by Bach ([[BWV&nbsp;118]], [[motet (Bach)|225\u2013231]], [[BWV Anh.|Anh.]]&nbsp;159\u2013165, [[Der Gerechte k\u00f6mmt um|deest]]),<ref>{{cite book |date=1998 |editor1-last=D\u00fcrr |editor1-first=Alfred |editor1-link=Alfred D\u00fcrr |editor2-last=Kobayashi |editor2-first=Yoshitake |title=[[Bach-Werke-Verzeichnis|Bach Werke Verzeichnis: Kleine Ausgabe \u2013 Nach der von Wolfgang Schmieder vorgelegten 2.

The melody of the first line is the same as that of the last line.{{sfn|Hymnary tune|2020}} As a key teaching of the Lutheran faith, the Gospel text reflects on Jesus Christ freeing man from sin and death, focused on the contrast of living \"in the flesh\" or \"according to the Spirit\".{{sfn|May|2020}} The hymn text is written from an individual believer's point of view, addressing Jesus as joy and support, against enemies and the vanity of existence, which are expressed in stark images. The hymn adds a layer of individuality and emotions to the Biblical teaching.{{sfn|Schmidt|2011}}\n\nMost of Bach's motets are difficult to date, and {{lang|de|Jesu, meine Freude}} is no exception.{{sfn|Melamed|1995|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=JDlBMqI628UC&pg=PA98 98]}}{{sfn|Graulich|Wolf|2002|p=V}} Bach's biographer [[Philipp Spitta]] assigned the motets, including {{lang|de|Jesu, meine Freude}}, to Bach's Leipzig years.{{sfn|Melamed|1995|pp=[https://books.google.com/books?id=JDlBMqI628UC&pg=PA85 85], [https://books.google.com/books?id=JDlBMqI628UC&pg=PA98 98]}} In 1912, Bernhard Friedrich Richter wrote that {{lang|de|Jesu, meine Freude}} was likely written for the funeral of Johanna Maria Kees, the wife of the Leipzig postmaster, on 18 July 1723, because a scripture reading of verse 11 from the Epistle passage set in the motet, in the tenth movement, is documented for the funeral.{{sfn|Melamed|1995|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=JDlBMqI628UC&pg=PA85 85]}}{{sfn|Hofmann|1995|p=IV}} The Cambridge musicologist Daniel R.

P. Jones]] said that several movements show a style too advanced to have been written in 1723, and assumed that the final arrangement of the work happened in the late 1720s, when two other motets were also written that can be dated with more certainty, ''Singet dem Herrn ein neues Lied'' and the funeral motet [[Der Geist hilft unser Schwachheit auf, BWV 226|''Der Geist hilft unser Schwachheit auf'', BWV 226]].{{sfn|Jones|2013|p=203}} The [[Dietel manuscript]], written around 1735, contains three chorales extracted from the motet, thus the composition of the motet is supposed to have been completed before that time.{{sfn|Bach Digital|2020}}{{sfn|Wolff|2002|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=ronZdkhQouMC&pg=PA329 329]}}\n\n== Music ==\n=== Structure and scoring ===\nThe motet is structured in eleven movements, with text alternating a chorale stanza and a passage from the Epistle.{{sfn|Dellal|2020}} Bach scored it for a choir of two [[soprano]] parts (S or SS), [[alto]] (A), [[tenor]] (T) and [[Bass (voice type)|bass]] (B). The number of voices in the movements varies from three to five.

The central movement is a five-part fugue.{{sfn|Posner|2020}}{{sfn|Gardiner|2013|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=lSBuAAAAQBAJ&pg=PT351 351]}}\n\n\n{| border=\"0\" cellspacing=\"2\" cellpadding=\"0\" width=\"700px\"\n| width=\"12%\" align=\"center\" bgcolor=\"#B3B7FF\" | '''1'''<br />chorale<br /> [[SATB]]\n| width=\"12%\" align=\"center\" bgcolor=\"#FFEBAD\" | Epistle<br />SSATB\n| width=\"12%\" align=\"center\" |\n{| border=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"1\" width=\"100%\"\n| align=\"center\" bgcolor=\"#B3B7FF\" | '''2'''<br />chorale<br /> SSATB\n|-\n| align=\"center\" bgcolor=\"#FFEBAD\" | Epistle<br />SSA\n|-\n| align=\"center\" bgcolor=\"#B3B7FF\" | '''3'''<br />free chorale<br />SSATB<br />{{nbsp}}\n|}\n| width=\"12%\" align=\"center\" bgcolor=\"#FFEBAD\" | Epistle<br />fugue<br />{{nbsp}}SSATB\n| width=\"12%\" align=\"center\" |\n{| border=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"1\" width=\"100%\"\n| align=\"center\" bgcolor=\"#B3B7FF\" | '''4'''<br />chorale<br />SATB\n|-\n| align=\"center\" bgcolor=\"#FFEBAD\" | Epistle<br />ATB\n|-\n| align=\"center\" bgcolor=\"#B3B7FF\" | '''5'''<br />chorale fantasia<br /> SSAT\n|}\n| width=\"12%\" align=\"center\" bgcolor=\"#FFEBAD\" | Epistle<br />SSATB<br> (similar to 2)\n| width=\"12%\" align=\"center\" bgcolor=\"#B3B7FF\" | '''6'''<br />chorale<br />SATB<br />(same as 1)\n|}\n==== 1 ====\nThe motet begins with a four-part setting of the first stanza of the hymn{{sfn|Graulich|Wolf|2003|p=2}} \"{{lang|de|Jesu, meine Freude|italic=no}}\" (Jesus, my joy).{{sfn|Dellal|2020}}{{sfn|Dahn 1|2018}} This and the other movements related to the hymn are in E minor. The text, in the first person, speaks of longing for Jesus.{{sfn|Dellal|2020}} Jones noted that the tenor part is particularly expressive.{{sfn|Jones|2013|p=203}} The last movement has exactly the same music to the different text of the last stanza, creating a frame.{{sfn|Jones|2013|p=203}}\n\n==== 2 ====\nThe second movement begins with excerpts from the Epistle to the Romans with \"{{lang|de|Es ist nun nichts Verdammliches an denen, die in Christo Jesu sind|italic=no}}\" (Now there is nothing damnable in those who are in Christ Jesus).{{sfn|Dellal|2020}} The difference of living in the flesh and the spirit is an aspect that will be repeated  throughout the motet.{{sfn|Dellal|2020}} The movement is also in E minor, but for five voices.{{sfn|Graulich|Wolf|2003|p=4}} The text is rendered first in rhetorical homophony.{{sfn|Jones|2013|p=203}}\n\nIn setting the first sentence, Bach accented the word \"nichts\" (nothing), repeating it twice, with long rests and echo dynamics. Jones noted that dramatic word painting of this kind was in the tradition of 17th-century motets, such as by [[Johann Christoph Bach]] and [[Johann Michael Bach]].{{sfn|Jones|2013|p=205}}\n\n==== 3 ====\n[[File:Picardy third Bach - BWV 81.7, mm. 12-13.png|thumb|upright=1.2|End of the third movement]]\nThe third movement is a five-part setting of the second stanza of the hymn,{{sfn|Graulich|Wolf|2003|p=13}} \"{{lang|de|Unter deinen Schirmen bin ich f\u00fcr den St\u00fcrmen aller Feinde frei|italic=no}}\" (Under your protection I am safe from the storms of all enemies).{{sfn|Dellal|2020}}{{sfn|Dahn 3|2018}} While the soprano provides the chorale melody, the lower voices supply vivid lines expressing the text.{{sfn|Jones|2013|p=203}}\n\n==== 4 ====\nThe fourth movement sets the second verse from the Epistle, \"{{lang|de|Denn das Gesetz des Geistes, der da lebendig machet in Christo Jesu, hat mich frei gemacht von dem Gesetz der S\u00fcnde und des Todes|italic=no}}\" (For the law of the spirit, which gives life in Christ Jesus, has made me free from the law of sin and death).{{sfn|Dellal|2020}} The thought is set for the two sopranos and alto, beginning in G major.{{sfn|Graulich|Wolf|2003|p=15}} The sopranos often move in \"beatific\" third parallels.{{sfn|Jones|2013|p=205}}\n\n==== 5 ====\nThe fifth movement is a setting of the third stanza of the hymn,{{sfn|Graulich|Wolf|2003|p=16}} \"{{lang|de|Trotz dem alten Drachen|italic=no}}\" (Defiance to the old dragon).{{sfn|Dellal|2020}} The defiant opposition, also to death, fear and the rage of the world, is expressed without the chorale melody, which is freely paraphrased in the soprano.{{sfn|Jones|2013|p=203}} Five voices take part in dramatic illustration of defiance, in the same rhetorical style as the beginning of the second movement,{{sfn|Jones|2013|p=203}} here often expressed in powerful [[unison]].{{sfn|Jones|2013|p=203}} The voices also depict standing firmly and singing, again in rhetorical homophony and reinforced in unison.{{sfn|Graulich|Wolf|2003|pp=16\u201322}} [[John Eliot Gardiner]] noted that the firm stance against opposition could depict [[Martin Luther]]'s attitude and also the composer's own stance.{{sfn|Gardiner|2013|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=lSBuAAAAQBAJ&pg=PT352 352]}}\n\n==== 6 ====\nThe central sixth movement sets verse 9 from the Epistle, \"{{lang|de|Ihr aber seid nicht fleischlich, sondern geistlich|italic=no}}\" (You, however, are not of the flesh, but rather of the Spirit).{{sfn|Dellal|2020}} Again beginning in G major, the tenor begins with a fugue theme that stresses the word \"geistlich\" (of the Spirit) by a long melisma in fast notes, while the opposite \"fleischlich\" is a long note stretched over the bar-line.{{sfn|Gardiner|2013|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=lSBuAAAAQBAJ&pg=PT351 351]}} The alto enters during the melisma. All five voices participate in a lively fugue,{{sfn|Graulich|Wolf|2003|pp=22\u201328}} the only one within the motet.{{sfn|Jones|2013|p=203}} It is a double fugue, with a first theme for the first line, another for the second,{{sfn|Jones|2013|p=205}} \"so anders Gottes Geist in euch wohnet\" (since the Spirit of God lives otherwise in you),{{sfn|Dellal|2020}} and then both combined.{{sfn|Jones|2013|p=205}}\n\n==== 7 ====\nThe seventh movement is a four-part setting of the fourth stanza of the hymn,{{sfn|Graulich|Wolf|2003|p=30}} \"{{lang|de|Weg mit allen Sch\u00e4tzen|italic=no}}\" (Away with all treasures).{{sfn|Dellal|2020}} While the soprano sings the chorale melody, the lower voices intensify the gesture dramatically: \"weg\" is repeated several times in fast succession.{{sfn|Graulich|Wolf|2003|p=30}}{{sfn|Dahn 7|2018}} Throughout the movement, the lower voices intensify the expressiveness of the text.{{sfn|Jones|2013|p=203}}\n\n==== 8 ====\nThe eighth movement sets verse 10 from the Epistle, \"{{lang|de|So aber Christus in euch ist, so ist der Leib zwar tot um der S\u00fcnde willen; der Geist aber ist das Leben um der Gerechtigkeit willen|italic=no}}\" (However if Christ is in you, then the body is dead indeed for the sake of sin; but the spirit is life for the sake of righteousness).{{sfn|Dellal|2020}} As in the fourth movement, it is set as a trio, this time for alto, tenor and bass, beginning in C major.{{sfn|Graulich|Wolf|2003|p=33}} Third parallels in the upper voices resemble those in the fourth movement.{{sfn|Jones|2013|p=205}}\n\n==== 9 ====\nThe ninth movement is a setting of the fifth stanza of the hymn,{{sfn|Graulich|Wolf|2003|p=36}} \"{{lang|de|Gute Nacht, o Wesen, das die Welt erlesen|italic=no}}\" (Good night, existence that cherishes the world).{{sfn|Dellal|2020}} For the rejection of everything earthly, Bach composed a [[chorale fantasia]], with the cantus firmus in the alto voice and two sopranos and tenor repeating \"Gute Nacht\" often.{{sfn|Graulich|Wolf|2003|pp=36\u201341}} Jones pointed out that the absence of a bass may depict that \"the world\" lacks a firm foundation in Christ.{{sfn|Jones|2013|pp=203\u2013204}} The chorale melody used in this movement is slightly different from the one in the other settings within the motet,{{sfn|Jones|2013|pp=204\u2013205}} a version which Bach used mostly in his earlier time in Weimar and before.{{sfn|Melamed|1995|pp=[https://books.google.com/books?id=JDlBMqI628UC&pg=PA86 86\u201387]}} For Gardiner, the \"sublime\" music suggests the style of Bach's Weimar period.{{sfn|Gardiner|2012}}{{rp|10}} Jones, however, found that the \"bewitchingly lyrical setting\" matched compositions from the mid-1720s in Leipzig,{{sfn|Jones|2013|pp=204}} comparing the music to the Sarabande from the [[Partitas for keyboard (Bach)|Partita No. 3, BWV 827]].{{sfn|Jones|2013|pp=204\u2013205}}\n\n==== 10 ====\nThe tenth movement sets verse 11 from the Epistle, \"{{lang|de|So nun der Geist des, der Jesum von den Toten auferwecket hat, in euch wohnet|italic=no}}\" (So now the spirit that awakened Jesus from the dead dwells in you).{{sfn|Dellal|2020}} In symmetry, the music recalls that of the second movement.{{sfn|Graulich|Wolf|2003|pp=42\u201345}}\n\n==== 11 ====\nThe motet ends with the same four-part setting as in the beginning, now with the text of the last stanza of the hymn,{{sfn|Graulich|Wolf|2003|p=46}} \"{{lang|de|Weicht, ihr Trauergeister|italic=no}}\" (Hence, you spirits of sadness).{{sfn|Dellal|2020}}{{sfn|Dahn 1|2018}} The final line repeats the beginning, on the same melody: \"Dennoch bleibst du auch im Leide, / Jesu, meine Freude\" (You stay with me even in sorrow, / Jesus, my joy).{{sfn|Dellal|2020}}\n\n== Reception ==\nThe structure of {{lang|de|Jesu, meine Freude}} has been regarded as unique in its complex symmetrical structure juxtaposing hymn text and Bible text.{{sfn|Jones|2013|p=202}} Bach's vivid setting of the contrasting texts, even illustrating single words, results in music of an unusual dramatic range.{{sfn|Eckerson|2020}} [[Christoph Wolff]] summarised: {{quote|This diversified structure of five-, four-, and three-part movements, with shifting configurations of voices and a highly interpretive word-tone relationship thoughout, wisely and sensibly combines choral exercise with theological education.{{sfn|Wolff|2002|p=249}}}}\n\n=== Manuscripts and publication ===\nAs for most of Bach's motets, the autograph score of {{lang|de|Jesu, meine Freude}} has not survived.<!-- Three of the chorales were included in the Dietel manuscript of {{circa|1735}}.{{sfn|Bach Digital|2020}}{{sfn|Wolff|2002|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=ronZdkhQouMC&pg=PA329 329]}}<!-- In the five-part setting of movement 3, Dietel omitted the second soprano part.{{sfn|Dahn 3|2018}}--> Like most of Bach's output, the motet was not published in the composer's lifetime. It first appeared in print in a collection of motets by [[Breitkopf & H\u00e4rtel]] in 1802/03,{{sfn|Melamed|1995|p=99}} edited by [[Johann Gottfried Schicht]], then the {{lang|de|Gewandhauskapellmeister}}.{{sfn|Wolf, Staehelin|2002|p=269}}\n\nTogether with other motets, {{lang|de|Jesu, meine Freude}} was published in 1892 in volume 39 of the [[Bach-Gesellschaft Ausgabe]] (BGA) of Bach's complete works, edited by [[Franz W\u00fcllner]]. The [[New Bach Edition]] (''Neue Bach-Ausgabe'', NBA) published the score in 1965, edited by {{ill|Konrad Ameln|de}}, with critical commentary published in 1967.{{sfn|Bach Digital|2020}} In 1995, [[B\u00e4renreiter]] published the vocal parts of the six motets BWV 225\u2013230 from the NBA in one volume, with a preface by [[Klaus Hofmann]].{{sfn|Hofmann|1995|p=VII}} The motets were published by [[Carus-Verlag]] in 1975, edited by [[G\u00fcnter Graulich]], and again in 2003, edited by [[Uwe Wolf (musicologist)|Uwe Wolf]], as part of ''Stuttgarter Bach-Ausgaben'', a complete edition of Bach's vocal works.{{sfn|Wolf|2002|p=I}}\n\n=== Performances and recordings ===\nAfter Bach's death, the motets, unlike much of his other music, were kept continuously in the repertoire of the [[Thomanerchor]].{{sfn|Hofmann|1995|p=VII}} Performers of {{lang|de|Jesu, meine Freude}} have to decide if they will use a boys' choir (as Bach had in mind) or a mixed choir, a small vocal ensemble or a larger choir, a continuo group, and instruments playing ''colla parte''.{{sfn|Wolf|2002|p=VII}}{{sfn|Veen|2010}}\n\nIn the 1920s, the large [[Bach Choir]] in London performed Bach's works conducted by [[Ralph Vaughan Williams]] , while [[Charles Kennedy Scott]] performed {{lang|de|Jesu, meine Freude}} with his Bach Cantata Club in chamber formation, which prompted a reviewer to write: {{quote|It would be absurd to forbid Bach's Motets to big choirs, but this performance left no doubt that the listener gets the truth of the music from voices few and picked.\"{{sfn|Haskell|1996|p=38}}}} They made the first recording of it, which was the first of any motet by Bach, in 1927, sung in English<!-- titled ''Jesus, Joy and Treasure''-->.{{sfn|Elste|2000}}\n\n{{lang|de|Jesu, meine Freude}} has been recorded more than 60 times, mostly in combination with other motets by Bach.{{sfn|ArkivMusic|2020}} In 1985, [[Philippe Herreweghe]] led the [[Collegium Vocale Gent]] and [[La Chapelle Royale]]. [[Harry Christophers]] directed a recording by [[The Sixteen]] in 1989.

The work takes its title from the [[Lutheran hymn]] \"{{lang|de|[[Jesu, meine Freude]]|italic=no}}\", with poetry by [[Johann Franck]] and a [[Chorale|chorale melody]] by [[Johann Cr\u00fcger]]. [[Movement (music)|Movements]] based on the six [[stanza]]s of the hymn are interspersed with five movements based on passages from the [[Epistle to the Romans]]. The Biblical text, which contains key [[Lutheranism|Lutheran]] teaching, is contrasted by the hymn, written in the first person with a focus on emotion, and Bach set both with attention to dramatic detail {{sfn|Eckerson|2020}} in a symmetrical structure of eleven movements. Bach set the [[chorale]] tune in various ways, from a four-part setting which begins and ends the work, to a [[chorale fantasia]] and a free setting which only paraphrases the tune. Four verses from the Epistle are set in [[motet]] style, two four five voices, and two for three voices. The central movement is a five-part [[Fugue (music)|fugue]].  Bach used [[word painting]] to intensify the theological meaning of both hymn and Epistle texts.\n\n{{lang|de|Jesu, meine Freude}} is one of few works by Bach for five vocal parts. It may have been composed for a funeral, but scholars doubt a 1912 dating to a specific funeral in Leipzig on 18 July 1723. Chorale settings from the motet were included in the [[Dietel manuscript]], a collection of Bach's chorales from {{circa|1735}}. At least one of the eleven movements seems to date to a period before Bach's post in Leipzig. [[Christoph Wolff]] suggested that it may have been composed for education in both choral singing and theology. The motet, unique in its complex symmetrical structure juxtaposing hymn text and Bible text, has been regarded as one of Bach's greatest motets.{{sfn|Cookson|2010}} It was the first of his motets to be recorded, in 1927.\n{{TOC limit|3}}\n\n== History ==\n[[File:Jesu Meine Freude Praxis Cruger 1653.jpeg|thumb|upright|\"{{lang|de|[[Jesu, meine Freude]]|italic=no}}\" in Johann Cr\u00fcger's ''[[Praxis pietatis melica]]'', 1653]]\nIn the context of late 17th-century [[Protestantism|Protestant]] Germany, where and when [[Johann Sebastian Bach]]'s ancestors composed their motets\u2014a collection of which was preserved in the {{lang|de|[[Altbachisches Archiv]]}}\u2014, motets were choral compositions, mostly with a number of independent voices exceeding that of a standard [[SATB]] choir, and with a text from sacred scripture and/or based on a [[Lutheran hymn]]. In the latter case, the [[Lutheran chorale|corresponding chorale tune]] was usually adopted into the composition. Instrumental accompaniment was often limited to [[basso continuo]] and/or instruments playing ''[[colla parte]]''. By the time Bach started to compose [[Motet (Bach)|his motets]] along these principles in the 1810s or 1820s, motets were regarded an antiquated genre. Bach composed most of [[church cantata (Bach)|his church cantatas]] for occasions of the [[Liturgical calendar (Lutheran)|Lutheran liturgical calendar]] of the time and place where he was occupied. Church cantatas for weddings and funerals fall outside such scheme, and also his motets appear to belong in this latter category.{{sfn|Cookson|2010}}\n\nAmong around 15 extant compositions which at some point or another were designated as a motet by Bach ([[BWV&nbsp;118]], [[motet (Bach)|225\u2013231]], [[BWV Anh.|Anh.]]&nbsp;159\u2013165, [[Der Gerechte k\u00f6mmt um|deest]]),<ref>{{cite book |date=1998 |editor1-last=D\u00fcrr |editor1-first=Alfred |editor1-link=Alfred D\u00fcrr |editor2-last=Kobayashi |editor2-first=Yoshitake |title=[[Bach-Werke-Verzeichnis|Bach Werke Verzeichnis: Kleine Ausgabe \u2013 Nach der von Wolfgang Schmieder vorgelegten 2.

The melody of the first line is the same as that of the last line.{{sfn|Hymnary tune|2020}} As a key teaching of the Lutheran faith, the Gospel text reflects on Jesus Christ freeing man from sin and death, focused on the contrast of living \"in the flesh\" or \"according to the Spirit\".{{sfn|May|2020}} The hymn text is written from an individual believer's point of view, addressing Jesus as joy and support, against enemies and the vanity of existence, which are expressed in stark images. The hymn adds a layer of individuality and emotions to the Biblical teaching.{{sfn|Schmidt|2011}}\n\nMost of Bach's motets are difficult to date, and {{lang|de|Jesu, meine Freude}} is no exception.{{sfn|Melamed|1995|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=JDlBMqI628UC&pg=PA98 98]}}{{sfn|Graulich|Wolf|2002|p=V}} Bach's biographer [[Philipp Spitta]] assigned the motets, including {{lang|de|Jesu, meine Freude}}, to Bach's Leipzig years.{{sfn|Melamed|1995|pp=[https://books.google.com/books?id=JDlBMqI628UC&pg=PA85 85], [https://books.google.com/books?id=JDlBMqI628UC&pg=PA98 98]}} In 1912, Bernhard Friedrich Richter wrote that {{lang|de|Jesu, meine Freude}} was likely written for the funeral of Johanna Maria Kees, the wife of the Leipzig postmaster, on 18 July 1723, because a scripture reading of verse 11 from the Epistle passage set in the motet, in the tenth movement, is documented for the funeral.{{sfn|Melamed|1995|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=JDlBMqI628UC&pg=PA85 85]}}{{sfn|Hofmann|1995|p=IV}} The Cambridge musicologist Daniel R.

P. Jones]] said that several movements show a style too advanced to have been written in 1723, and assumed that the final arrangement of the work happened in the late 1720s, when two other motets were also written that can be dated with more certainty, ''Singet dem Herrn ein neues Lied'' and the funeral motet [[Der Geist hilft unser Schwachheit auf, BWV 226|''Der Geist hilft unser Schwachheit auf'', BWV 226]].{{sfn|Jones|2013|p=203}}\n\nThe [[Dietel manuscript]], written around 1735, contains three chorales extracted from the motet, thus the composition of the motet is supposed to have been completed before that time.{{sfn|Bach Digital|2020}}{{sfn|Wolff|2002|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=ronZdkhQouMC&pg=PA329 329]}}\n\n== Music ==\n=== Structure and scoring ===\nThe motet is structured in eleven movements, with text alternating a chorale stanza and a passage from the Epistle.{{sfn|Dellal|2020}} Bach scored it for a choir of two [[soprano]] parts (S or SS), [[alto]] (A), [[tenor]] (T) and [[Bass (voice type)|bass]] (B). The number of voices in the movements varies from three to five.

Jones noted that dramatic word painting of this kind was in the tradition of 17th-century motets, such as by [[Johann Christoph Bach]] and [[Johann Michael Bach]].{{sfn|Jones|2013|p=205}}\n\n==== 3 ====\n[[File:Picardy third Bach - BWV 81.7, mm. 12-13.png|thumb|upright=1.2|End of the third movement]]\nThe third movement is a five-part setting of the second stanza of the hymn,{{sfn|Graulich|Wolf|2003|p=13}} \"{{lang|de|Unter deinen Schirmen bin ich f\u00fcr den St\u00fcrmen aller Feinde frei|italic=no}}\" (Under your protection I am safe from the storms of all enemies).{{sfn|Dellal|2020}}{{sfn|Dahn 3|2018}} While the soprano provides the chorale melody, the lower voices supply vivid lines expressing the text.{{sfn|Jones|2013|p=203}}\n\n==== 4 ====\nThe fourth movement sets the second verse from the Epistle, \"{{lang|de|Denn das Gesetz des Geistes, der da lebendig machet in Christo Jesu, hat mich frei gemacht von dem Gesetz der S\u00fcnde und des Todes|italic=no}}\" (For the law of the spirit, which gives life in Christ Jesus, has made me free from the law of sin and death).{{sfn|Dellal|2020}} The thought is set for the two sopranos and alto, beginning in G major.{{sfn|Graulich|Wolf|2003|p=15}} The sopranos often move in \"beatific\" third parallels.{{sfn|Jones|2013|p=205}}\n\n==== 5 ====\nThe fifth movement is a setting of the third stanza of the hymn,{{sfn|Graulich|Wolf|2003|p=16}} \"{{lang|de|Trotz dem alten Drachen|italic=no}}\" (Defiance to the old dragon).{{sfn|Dellal|2020}} The defiant opposition, also to death, fear and the rage of the world, is expressed without the chorale melody, which is freely paraphrased in the soprano.{{sfn|Jones|2013|p=203}} Five voices take part in dramatic illustration of defiance, in the same rhetorical style as the beginning of the second movement,{{sfn|Jones|2013|p=203}} here often expressed in powerful [[unison]].{{sfn|Jones|2013|p=203}} The voices also depict standing firmly and singing, again in rhetorical homophony and reinforced in unison.{{sfn|Graulich|Wolf|2003|pp=16\u201322}} [[John Eliot Gardiner]] noted that the firm stance against opposition could depict [[Martin Luther]]'s attitude and also the composer's own stance.{{sfn|Gardiner|2013|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=lSBuAAAAQBAJ&pg=PT352 352]}}\n\n==== 6 ====\nThe central sixth movement sets verse 9 from the Epistle, \"{{lang|de|Ihr aber seid nicht fleischlich, sondern geistlich|italic=no}}\" (You, however, are not of the flesh, but rather of the Spirit).{{sfn|Dellal|2020}} Again beginning in G major, the tenor begins with a fugue theme that stresses the word \"geistlich\" (of the Spirit) by a long melisma in fast notes, while the opposite \"fleischlich\" is a long note stretched over the bar-line.{{sfn|Gardiner|2013|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=lSBuAAAAQBAJ&pg=PT351 351]}} The alto enters during the melisma. All five voices participate in a lively fugue,{{sfn|Graulich|Wolf|2003|pp=22\u201328}} the only one within the motet.{{sfn|Jones|2013|p=203}} It is a double fugue, with a first theme for the first line, another for the second,{{sfn|Jones|2013|p=205}} \"so anders Gottes Geist in euch wohnet\" (since the Spirit of God lives otherwise in you),{{sfn|Dellal|2020}} and then both combined.{{sfn|Jones|2013|p=205}}\n\n==== 7 ====\nThe seventh movement is a four-part setting of the fourth stanza of the hymn,{{sfn|Graulich|Wolf|2003|p=30}} \"{{lang|de|Weg mit allen Sch\u00e4tzen|italic=no}}\" (Away with all treasures).{{sfn|Dellal|2020}} While the soprano sings the chorale melody, the lower voices intensify the gesture dramatically: \"weg\" is repeated several times in fast succession.{{sfn|Graulich|Wolf|2003|p=30}}{{sfn|Dahn 7|2018}} Throughout the movement, the lower voices intensify the expressiveness of the text.{{sfn|Jones|2013|p=203}}\n\n==== 8 ====\nThe eighth movement sets verse 10 from the Epistle, \"{{lang|de|So aber Christus in euch ist, so ist der Leib zwar tot um der S\u00fcnde willen; der Geist aber ist das Leben um der Gerechtigkeit willen|italic=no}}\" (However if Christ is in you, then the body is dead indeed for the sake of sin; but the spirit is life for the sake of righteousness).{{sfn|Dellal|2020}} As in the fourth movement, it is set as a trio, this time for alto, tenor and bass, beginning in C major.{{sfn|Graulich|Wolf|2003|p=33}} Third parallels in the upper voices resemble those in the fourth movement.{{sfn|Jones|2013|p=205}}\n\n==== 9 ====\nThe ninth movement is a setting of the fifth stanza of the hymn,{{sfn|Graulich|Wolf|2003|p=36}} \"{{lang|de|Gute Nacht, o Wesen, das die Welt erlesen|italic=no}}\" (Good night, existence that cherishes the world).{{sfn|Dellal|2020}} For the rejection of everything earthly, Bach composed a [[chorale fantasia]], with the cantus firmus in the alto voice and two sopranos and tenor repeating \"Gute Nacht\" often.{{sfn|Graulich|Wolf|2003|pp=36\u201341}} Jones pointed out that the absence of a bass may depict that \"the world\" lacks a firm foundation in Christ.{{sfn|Jones|2013|pp=203\u2013204}} The chorale melody used in this movement is slightly different from the one in the other settings within the motet,{{sfn|Jones|2013|pp=204\u2013205}} a version which Bach used mostly in his earlier time in Weimar and before.{{sfn|Melamed|1995|pp=[https://books.google.com/books?id=JDlBMqI628UC&pg=PA86 86\u201387]}} For Gardiner, the \"sublime\" music suggests the style of Bach's Weimar period.{{sfn|Gardiner|2012}}{{rp|10}} Jones, however, found that the \"bewitchingly lyrical setting\" matched compositions from the mid-1720s in Leipzig,{{sfn|Jones|2013|pp=204}} comparing the music to the Sarabande from the [[Partitas for keyboard (Bach)|Partita No. 3, BWV 827]].{{sfn|Jones|2013|pp=204\u2013205}}\n\n==== 10 ====\nThe tenth movement sets verse 11 from the Epistle, \"{{lang|de|So nun der Geist des, der Jesum von den Toten auferwecket hat, in euch wohnet|italic=no}}\" (So now the spirit that awakened Jesus from the dead dwells in you).{{sfn|Dellal|2020}} In symmetry, the music recalls that of the second movement.{{sfn|Graulich|Wolf|2003|pp=42\u201345}}\n\n==== 11 ====\nThe motet ends with the same four-part setting as in the beginning, now with the text of the last stanza of the hymn,{{sfn|Graulich|Wolf|2003|p=46}} \"{{lang|de|Weicht, ihr Trauergeister|italic=no}}\" (Hence, you spirits of sadness).{{sfn|Dellal|2020}}{{sfn|Dahn 1|2018}} The final line repeats the beginning, on the same melody: \"Dennoch bleibst du auch im Leide, / Jesu, meine Freude\" (You stay with me even in sorrow, / Jesus, my joy).{{sfn|Dellal|2020}}\n\n== Reception ==\nThe structure of {{lang|de|Jesu, meine Freude}} has been regarded as unique in its complex symmetrical structure juxtaposing hymn text and Bible text.{{sfn|Jones|2013|p=202}} Bach's vivid setting of the contrasting texts, even illustrating single words, results in music of an unusual dramatic range.{{sfn|Eckerson|2020}} [[Christoph Wolff]] summarised: {{quote|This diversified structure of five-, four-, and three-part movements, with shifting configurations of voices and a highly interpretive word-tone relationship thoughout, wisely and sensibly combines choral exercise with theological education.{{sfn|Wolff|2002|p=249}}}}\n\n=== Manuscripts and publication ===\nAs for most of Bach's motets, the autograph score of {{lang|de|Jesu, meine Freude}} has not survived.<!-- Three of the chorales were included in the Dietel manuscript of {{circa|1735}}.{{sfn|Bach Digital|2020}}{{sfn|Wolff|2002|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=ronZdkhQouMC&pg=PA329 329]}}<!-- In the five-part setting of movement 3, Dietel omitted the second soprano part.{{sfn|Dahn 3|2018}}--> Like most of Bach's output, the motet was not published in the composer's lifetime. It first appeared in print in a collection of motets by [[Breitkopf & H\u00e4rtel]] in 1802/03,{{sfn|Melamed|1995|p=99}} edited by [[Johann Gottfried Schicht]], then the {{lang|de|Gewandhauskapellmeister}}.{{sfn|Wolf, Staehelin|2002|p=269}}\n\nTogether with other motets, {{lang|de|Jesu, meine Freude}} was published in 1892 in volume 39 of the [[Bach-Gesellschaft Ausgabe]] (BGA) of Bach's complete works, edited by [[Franz W\u00fcllner]]. The [[New Bach Edition]] (''Neue Bach-Ausgabe'', NBA) published the score in 1965, edited by {{ill|Konrad Ameln|de}}, with critical commentary published in 1967.{{sfn|Bach Digital|2020}} In 1995, [[B\u00e4renreiter]] published the vocal parts of the six motets BWV 225\u2013230 from the NBA in one volume, with a preface by [[Klaus Hofmann]].{{sfn|Hofmann|1995|p=VII}} The motets were published by [[Carus-Verlag]] in 1975, edited by [[G\u00fcnter Graulich]], and again in 2003, edited by [[Uwe Wolf (musicologist)|Uwe Wolf]], as part of ''Stuttgarter Bach-Ausgaben'', a complete edition of Bach's vocal works.{{sfn|Wolf|2002|p=I}}\n\n=== Performances and recordings ===\nAfter Bach's death, the motets, unlike much of his other music, were kept continuously in the repertoire of the [[Thomanerchor]].{{sfn|Hofmann|1995|p=VII}} Performers of {{lang|de|Jesu, meine Freude}} have to decide if they will use a boys' choir (as Bach had in mind) or a mixed choir, a small vocal ensemble or a larger choir, a continuo group, and instruments playing ''colla parte''.{{sfn|Wolf|2002|p=VII}}{{sfn|Veen|2010}}\n\nIn the 1920s, the large [[Bach Choir]] in London performed Bach's works conducted by [[Ralph Vaughan Williams]] , while [[Charles Kennedy Scott]] performed {{lang|de|Jesu, meine Freude}} with his Bach Cantata Club in chamber formation, which prompted a reviewer to write: {{quote|It would be absurd to forbid Bach's Motets to big choirs, but this performance left no doubt that the listener gets the truth of the music from voices few and picked.\"{{sfn|Haskell|1996|p=38}}}} They made the first recording of it, which was the first of any motet by Bach, in 1927, sung in English<!-- titled ''Jesus, Joy and Treasure''-->.{{sfn|Elste|2000}}\n\n{{lang|de|Jesu, meine Freude}} has been recorded more than 60 times, mostly in combination with other motets by Bach.{{sfn|ArkivMusic|2020}} In 1985, [[Philippe Herreweghe]] led the [[Collegium Vocale Gent]] and [[La Chapelle Royale]]. [[Harry Christophers]] directed a recording by [[The Sixteen]] in 1989. [[Masaaki Suzuki]] conducted performances of the [[Bach Collegium Japan]] in 2009, using instruments playing ''colla parte''.{{sfn|Cookson|2010}}\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist|20em}}\n\n=== Cited sources ===\n''Bach Digital''\n* {{cite web\n| url = https://www.bach-digital.de/receive/BachDigitalWork_work_00000284\n| title =  Jesu, meine Freude BWV 227; BC C 5 \n| website = [[Bach Digital]]\n| year = 2020\n| accessdate = 19 March 2020\n| ref = {{sfnref|Bach Digital|2020}}\n}}\n\n''Books''\n* {{cite book\n| last = Ameln\n| first = Konrad\n| url = https://www.baerenreiter.com/en/shop/product/details/BA5193/\n| title = Bach, Johann Sebastian / Jesu, meine Freude for five-part mixed choir in E minor BWV 227\n| website = [[B\u00e4renreiter]]\n| date = 1965\n| accessdate = 19 March 2020\n| ref = harv\n}} ISMN 979-0-00-649848-2\n* {{cite web\n| last = Gardiner\n| first = John Eliot\n| authorlink = John Eliot Gardiner\n| url = https://books.google.com/books?id=lSBuAAAAQBAJ&pg=PT350\n| title = Music in the Castle of Heaven: A Portrait of Johann Sebastian Bach\n| publisher = Penguin UK\n| date = 2013\n| pages = 350\u2013352\n| isbn = 978-1-84-614721-0\n| ref = harv\n}}\n* {{cite book\n| translator-last1 = Lunn\n| translator-first1 = Jean\n| date = 2003\n| editor-last = Graulich\n| editor-first = G\u00fcnter\n| editor-link = G\u00fcnter Graulich\n| editor2-last = Wolf\n| editor2-first = Uwe\n| editor2-link = Uwe Wolf (musicologist)\n| title = Johann Sebastian Bach: Jesu, meine Freude / Jesus, my salvation \u2013 BWV 227\n| url = https://www.carusmedia.com/images-intern/medien/30/3122700/3122700x.pdf\n| type = [[Urtext edition|Urtext]], full score\n| series = Stuttgarter Bach-Ausgaben\n| language = de, en\n| others = Continuo realisation by Horn, Paul\n| publisher = [[Carus Verlag|Carus]]\n| id = CV 31.227\n| ref = harv\n}}\n* {{cite book\n| last = Haskell\n| first = Harry\n| url = https://books.google.com/books?id=bGG22O24ObAC&pg=PA38\n| title = The Early Music Revival: A History\n| publisher = [[Courier Corporation]]\n| year = 1996\n| page = 38\n| isbn = 978-0-48-629162-8\n| ref = harv\n}}\n* {{cite book\n| last = Hofmann\n| first = Klaus\n| authorlink = Klaus Hofmann\n| url = https://www.baerenreiter.com/en/shop/product/details/BA5193/\n| title = J.

Natalie first appeared in January 1994, depicted initially as an unhappy, insecure teenager; she was among various regular characters brought in to increase the cast following the BBC's decision to increase episode output to three per week. She featured most often with the characters [[Ricky Butcher]] ([[Sid Owen]]) and [[Bianca Jackson]] ([[Patsy Palmer]]); Natalie's affair with Ricky ending his relationship with Bianca was one of the prominent storylines aired in the Winter of 1995. Despite producers offering to extend Speed's contact, she opted to leave the serial in 1995.\n\nExecutive producer [[Matthew Robinson (producer)|Matthew Robinson]] reintroduced the character in 1999 as a business woman and a [[Romantic interest|love interest]] for [[Barry Evans (EastEnders)|Barry Evans]] ([[Shaun Williamson]]). Speed left once again in 2004, with Natalie departing in the wake of Barry's murder by [[Janine Butcher]] ([[Charlie Brooks]]).\n\n==Storylines==\n\n===Backstory===\nNatalie's parents separated early in her childhood and she took it badly. She lived with her mother [[Andrea Price|Andrea]] ([[Cindy O'Callaghan]]) in [[Walford]], but she had been closer to her father, Dave, and missed him terribly. Andrea favoured her other children, especially her older daughter [[List of EastEnders characters (1999)#Susie Price|Susie]] (Viva Duce), over Natalie. She was highly critical of Natalie and blamed her for the breakdown of her marriage (the unwanted pregnancy had ruined her figure and singing career, causing her husband to leave her). Andrea and Susie ridiculed Natalie for missing her father and wanting to keep in touch; Andrea claimed that Dave had no interest in Natalie.\n\nAt age 11 when she was in secondary school, Natalie met [[Bianca Jackson]] ([[Patsy Palmer]]). They became friends, but Bianca often sidelined her in favour of [[Tiffany Mitchell|Tiffany Raymond]] ([[Martine McCutcheon]]), whom Bianca treated with more respect than Natalie. In fact, Tiffany joined Bianca in teasing Natalie. Natalie resented Tiffany and was pleased when she moved away after leaving school at 16 in 1993.\n\n===1994\u20132004===\nMischievous Natalie often entices Bianca into trouble, but Bianca is more domineering, often putting Natalie down. Lonely, Natalie makes up an imaginary boyfriend for attention, claiming he has taken her on extravagant dates. This makes Bianca envious initially, but when Natalie's lies are discovered, Bianca takes great pleasure in humiliating her.\n\nWhen Tiffany reappears, Natalie feels sidelined by Bianca as she did in school. Bianca's boyfriend [[Ricky Butcher]] ([[Sid Owen]]) also tires of Bianca's selfishness and this inadvertently drives him and Natalie closer together. They console each other and in February 1995, they begin an affair. Ricky is Natalie's first sexual partner and for her it is true love, but Ricky does not take it as seriously. Natalie starts pressuring Ricky to tell Bianca about their relationship and when he does not, Natalie plants some lingerie in his work overalls. Bianca finds it and suspects Ricky is having an affair; she takes Natalie's advice to follow Ricky so she can catch him with the mystery woman. Bianca does this one night and catches them kissing and is incensed. In the aftermath, Ricky dumps Natalie and Bianca threatens her, ordering her to leave Walford. Dejected, Natalie does so, leaving Walford to stay with her sister in [[Basingstoke]].\n\nIn 1999, Natalie reappears as a new self-confident business woman, running a dating agency. [[Barry Evans (EastEnders)|Barry Evans]] ([[Shaun Williamson]]), unaware of Natalie's history, uses her agency, \"Romantic Relations\". Despite Natalie's attempts to set Barry up with other female hopefuls, she eventually becomes attracted to him herself and they begin dating. Natalie's reappearance is met unfavourably by Bianca and fights ensue. However, they eventually call a truce and become friends again. Natalie's business does not prosper and closes soon after.\n[[File:Natalie Barry Evans EE.jpg|left|thumb|[[Barry Evans (EastEnders)|Barry]] and Natalie marry (1999)|170px]]\n\nDespite initial problems caused by Natalie's overbearing mother who tries to take over the wedding plans, Natalie and Barry marry on [[New Year's Eve]] in 1999, in a joint wedding with [[Ian Beale]] ([[Adam Woodyatt]]) and [[Mel Owen|Mel Healy]] ([[Tamzin Outhwaite]]). They live with Barry's father [[Roy Evans (EastEnders)|Roy Evans]] ([[Tony Caunter]]) and stepmother [[Pat Evans (EastEnders)|Pat Evans]] ([[Pam St. Clement]]) and are relatively happy until Natalie becomes pregnant. Preferring to concentrate on her career, and unable to make Barry realise how she feels, Natalie plans an abortion. When Barry comes to the clinic, pledging to support her decision, Natalie changes her mind and does not have the termination. Barry is overjoyed and agrees to give up work and look after the baby so she can work, giving birth to son [[Jack Evans (EastEnders)|Jack]] (Samuel and Joseph Timson) early in 2002\u2014the birth is traumatic as Jack was [[breech birth|born feet first]]. Motherhood is hard for Natalie; she begins to feel that she has two children, Jack and Barry. When Barry's half-brother, [[Nathan Williams (EastEnders)|Nathan Williams]] ([[Doug Allen (actor)|Doug Allen]]), moves in briefly, he makes Natalie an unsuspecting pawn in his vendetta. Determined to ruin Barry, Nathan tries to seduce Natalie and they kiss briefly but she soon realises that Nathan wants to ruin Barry and banishes him from their lives. Barry forgives Natalie; their marriage remains intact but Natalie grows increasingly unhappy with Barry's immaturity.\n\nFeeling stifled and trapped, she turns to Ricky. They rekindle their affair and decide to leave [[Albert Square]] with their sons. On the night of her 26th birthday, while Barry plans a secret party in [[The Queen Victoria]] [[public house]], Natalie prepares to leave. Barry discovers what is happening just as Natalie is leaving. Desperate to prove his love, he drags Natalie into the pub and begs her to stay. Natalie breaks Barry's heart by admitting that she does not love him and despite his pleading, refuses to give their marriage another chance. During the chaos, Ricky's sister, [[Janine Butcher]] ([[Charlie Brooks]]), ruins their plans by telling Natalie about Ricky's one-night stand with [[Sam Mitchell (EastEnders)|Sam Mitchell]] ([[Kim Medcalf]]) days before. Confronted by Barry but unable to trust Ricky and racked with guilt, Natalie ends things with Ricky and leaves Walford alone, later divorcing Barry. When Roy dies from a heart attack the following day, Natalie later returns to his funeral and decides to stay in Walford for a while. Janine encourages the divorce and sets a plan in motion to manipulate Barry and steal his money, aided by [[Paul Trueman]] ([[Gary Beadle]]), Janine's true boyfriend. This eventually leads to Barry's untimely demise, when Janine pushes him from a cliff and leaves him to die, the day after they marry on New Year's Eve 2003 in [[Scotland]]. Janine inherits Barry's wealth, leaving Natalie and Jack nothing.\n\nSuspecting foul play, Natalie tries to prove Janine has murdered Barry but is unsuccessful. She refuses to leave with Ricky, who leaves following Janine's confession of what really happened to Barry (but keeps this to himself). While Natalie comes to terms with Barry's death, she gets close to Paul, who is desperate to make amends to Natalie and Jack for his part in Barry's death. Despite his feelings for Natalie, Paul struggles with his guilt and when Natalie gets suspicious about Paul's relationship with Janine, he finally reveals Janine's role in Barry's death and makes a statement to the police. Janine is questioned but released due to lack of evidence. She promptly tells Natalie that Paul conspired with her from the start and gloats about getting away with murder. Devastated, and unable to prove Janine's guilt to the police, Natalie leaves Paul and Albert Square in March 2004. She returns briefly in May to witness Janine's incarceration after she is falsely accused of murdering [[Laura Beale]] ([[Hannah Waterman]]). Natalie makes peace with Paul, holding a ceremony for Barry by scattering his ashes under a tree planted in his memory. She and Jack leave but it is indicated that Pat stays in touch with Natalie when she goes to stay with her off-screen in 2007, following an accident.\n\n==Creation and development==\n\n===Casting===\n1994 was a \"historic\" year for ''EastEnders'', as in April a third weekly episode was introduced.<ref name=\"first10years\">{{cite book |last=Brake|first= Colin|authorlink= Colin Brake|title= EastEnders: The First 10 Years: A Celebration |year=1995|publisher=BBC Books|isbn=978-0-563-37057-4|title-link= EastEnders spin-offs#Non-fiction books}}</ref> Due to the programme's increased frequency, a number of new characters were introduced to the regular cast in the latter part of 1993 and early 1994.<ref name=\"first10years\"/> Among them was Natalie Price, who made her first appearance in January 1994 as the best friend of [[Bianca Jackson|Bianca]] ([[Patsy Palmer]]).

On-screen Natalie and Ricky found themselves sidelined and bullied by Bianca, forcing them together and leading to their eventual affair, which continued for several weeks on-screen, with Ricky seeing both Natalie and Bianca.

In an interview with the \u2018\u2019Walford Gazette\u2019\u2019, Speed commented: \u201cI was very frightened by it quite frankly and certainly unprepared for it. I didn't like at all the attention that came with being on such a high-profile show. It simply wasn't what I signed up for in the first place-all that craziness. I was naive, I admit. Of course it does come with the job of being on the show and you have to learn to deal with it and cope with it. The advantages always outweigh the drawbacks, anyway, but it didn't seem like that to me at the time. I was very young and extremely shy, so it all became a huge difficulty for me\u2026But I also have to make it clear that from the beginning when I joined, I always intended to stay in it for just a year anyway. I honoured my initial one-year contract and then moved on\u2026they did express their interest in signing me for another year, but I politely but firmly declined. They were a bit shocked. I tried to explain in the best way I could my reasons for leaving at the end of my contract and they ultimately understood, and so I left on good terms with them\u2026I had some growing up to do and instinctively knew that growing up more or less in front of the British public for one year was enough!\u201d<ref name=\"wg\"/>\n\n===Reintroduction and marriage to Barry Evans===\nAfter a four-year absence, Lucy Speed decided that she wanted to return to the series. She mentioned this to her former castmate [[Ross Kemp]], who played [[Grant Mitchell (EastEnders)|Grant Mitchell]] in the serial and he initiated contact between Speed and then executive-producer, [[Matthew Robinson (producer)|Matthew Robinson]]. Robinson had been thinking of introducing a new love-interest for the character [[Barry Evans (EastEnders)|Barry Evans]] ([[Shaun Williamson]]) and he had already considered the possibility that the love interest could be Natalie. Speed has commented \u201cIt was good timing. He thought I and the character fit the bill.\u201d<ref name=\"wg\"/> Natalie made her reappearance on-screen on 8 March 1999 and a relationship between the two characters was developed.

Natalie really adored her dad but he couldn't put up with that horrible wife of his, Andrea\u2026 and so he walked out on the family.

Perfectly reasonable, you might think [\u2026] but no! Our plucky hero Barry comes to her rescue, gently persuading her that she's just a little over-emotional and, phew \u2013 thank God he did, because here we are with a happy new family that might otherwise never have been. Dappy Natalie nearly screwed everything up. Men, even such sorry specimens as the perpetually pouting Barry, really are jolly decent to put up with these female follies and calmly guide their gals in the right direction\".<ref name=\"CUSU\"/>\n\nNightingale suggested that the storyline \"echoed\" the assertion that a woman cannot be trusted to make her own decision about abortion, which she describes as profoundly undermining and a \"subtle\" reinforcement of an \"underlying implication\" that women should be punished for exercising their legal right.<ref name=\"CUSU\"/> She comments, \"I am confused by the writers' unswerving insistence on her absolute certainty that abortion was the right choice for her, until the very last moment \u2013 such portrayals smack of her finally 'seeing the light'. Had the Natalie presented been a confused or uncertain woman, her change of heart would have seemed infinitely more credible, but she was neither. In fact, the very plausibility of the script was sacrificed, presumably to make a point \u2013 and the only one I can dig out is that of the dangers of going through with an abortion, even if you think you're sure \u2013 come on, what do you know?\".<ref name=\"CUSU\"/>\n\n====Adultery====\nNatalie and Barry's marriage sours towards the end of 2002, when she is momentarily tempted by the charms of his scheming half-brother Nathan (Doug Allen).

He discovered that the participants were both active and implicit in the reproduction of ideology about family relationships and gender, identified via discussion of the friendship between Bianca and Natalie. Girls viewed Natalie more favourably than Bianca in 1995, and the author noted that tensions in \"girl-culture\" \u2013 attraction to the traditional private world of interpersonal relationships and the desire to take up more assertive characteristics in public \u2013 manifested themselves in discussions about Bianca and her friend Natalie Price. Natalie was constructed as a \"nice person\" in contrast to Bianca, \"[Natalie] can relate to Ricky [...] cares for other people and doesn't just think about herself [like Bianca does]\", qualities that were said to be constitutive of the traditional identity of women.<ref>{{cite book |author=Chris Barker|title= Global Television: An Introduction|url=https://archive.org/details/globaltelevision00chri|url-access=registration|year=1997|publisher=Oxford: Blackwell |isbn=978-0-631-20150-2}}</ref>\n\nLinda Ruth Williams, author of ''The erotic thriller in contemporary cinema'', was critical of a scene featuring Natalie speaking in a derogatory manner about the [[erotic thriller]] film genre.

Natalie retorted that \"pinning me up against the erotic thriller section\" was not her idea of a romantic setting for sex.

Natalie first appeared in January 1994, depicted initially as an unhappy, insecure teenager; she was among various regular characters brought in to increase the cast following the BBC's decision to increase episode output to three per week. She featured most often with the characters [[Ricky Butcher]] ([[Sid Owen]]) and [[Bianca Jackson]] ([[Patsy Palmer]]); Natalie's affair with Ricky ending his relationship with Bianca was one of the prominent storylines aired in the Winter of 1995. Despite producers offering to extend Speed's contact, she opted to leave the serial in 1995.\n\nExecutive producer [[Matthew Robinson (producer)|Matthew Robinson]] reintroduced the character in 1999 as a business woman and a [[Romantic interest|love interest]] for [[Barry Evans (EastEnders)|Barry Evans]] ([[Shaun Williamson]]). Speed left once again in 2004, with Natalie departing in the wake of Barry's murder by [[Janine Butcher]] ([[Charlie Brooks]]).\n\n==Storylines==\n\n===Backstory===\nNatalie's parents separated early in her childhood and she took it badly. She lived with her mother [[Andrea Price|Andrea]] ([[Cindy O'Callaghan]]) in [[Walford]], but she had been closer to her father, Dave, and missed him terribly. Andrea favoured her other children, especially her older daughter [[List of EastEnders characters (1999)#Susie Price|Susie]] (Viva Duce), over Natalie. She was highly critical of Natalie and blamed her for the breakdown of her marriage (the unwanted pregnancy had ruined her figure and singing career, causing her husband to leave her). Andrea and Susie ridiculed Natalie for missing her father and wanting to keep in touch; Andrea claimed that Dave had no interest in Natalie.\n\nAt age 11 when she was in secondary school, Natalie met [[Bianca Jackson]] ([[Patsy Palmer]]). They became friends, but Bianca often sidelined her in favour of [[Tiffany Mitchell|Tiffany Raymond]] ([[Martine McCutcheon]]), whom Bianca treated with more respect than Natalie. In fact, Tiffany joined Bianca in teasing Natalie. Natalie resented Tiffany and was pleased when she moved away after leaving school at 16 in 1993.\n\n===1994\u20132004===\nMischievous Natalie often entices Bianca into trouble, but Bianca is more domineering, often putting Natalie down. Lonely, Natalie makes up an imaginary boyfriend for attention, claiming he has taken her on extravagant dates. This makes Bianca envious initially, but when Natalie's lies are discovered, Bianca takes great pleasure in humiliating her.\n\nWhen Tiffany reappears, Natalie feels sidelined by Bianca as she did in school. Bianca's boyfriend [[Ricky Butcher]] ([[Sid Owen]]) also tires of Bianca's selfishness and this inadvertently drives him and Natalie closer together. They console each other and in February 1995, they begin an affair. Ricky is Natalie's first sexual partner and for her it is true love, but Ricky does not take it as seriously. Natalie starts pressuring Ricky to tell Bianca about their relationship and when he does not, Natalie plants some lingerie in his work overalls. Bianca finds it and suspects Ricky is having an affair; she takes Natalie's advice to follow Ricky so she can catch him with the mystery woman. Bianca does this one night and catches them kissing and is incensed. In the aftermath, Ricky dumps Natalie and Bianca threatens her, ordering her to leave Walford. Dejected, Natalie does so, leaving Walford to stay with her sister in [[Basingstoke]].\n\nIn 1999, Natalie reappears as a new self-confident business woman, running a dating agency. [[Barry Evans (EastEnders)|Barry Evans]] ([[Shaun Williamson]]), unaware of Natalie's history, uses her agency, \"Romantic Relations\". Despite Natalie's attempts to set Barry up with other female hopefuls, she eventually becomes attracted to him herself and they begin dating. Natalie's reappearance is met unfavourably by Bianca and fights ensue. However, they eventually call a truce and become friends again. Natalie's business does not prosper and closes soon after.\n[[File:Natalie Barry Evans EE.jpg|left|thumb|[[Barry Evans (EastEnders)|Barry]] and Natalie marry (1999)|170px]]\n\nDespite initial problems caused by Natalie's overbearing mother who tries to take over the wedding plans, Natalie and Barry marry on [[New Year's Eve]] in 1999, in a joint wedding with [[Ian Beale]] ([[Adam Woodyatt]]) and [[Mel Owen|Mel Healy]] ([[Tamzin Outhwaite]]). They live with Barry's father [[Roy Evans (EastEnders)|Roy Evans]] ([[Tony Caunter]]) and stepmother [[Pat Evans (EastEnders)|Pat Evans]] ([[Pam St. Clement]]) and are relatively happy until Natalie becomes pregnant. Preferring to concentrate on her career, and unable to make Barry realise how she feels, Natalie plans an abortion. When Barry comes to the clinic, pledging to support her decision, Natalie changes her mind and does not have the termination. Barry is overjoyed and agrees to give up work and look after the baby so she can work, giving birth to son [[Jack Evans (EastEnders)|Jack]] (Samuel and Joseph Timson) early in 2002\u2014the birth is traumatic as Jack was [[breech birth|born feet first]]. Motherhood is hard for Natalie; she begins to feel that she has two children, Jack and Barry. When Barry's half-brother, [[Nathan Williams (EastEnders)|Nathan Williams]] ([[Doug Allen (actor)|Doug Allen]]), moves in briefly, he makes Natalie an unsuspecting pawn in his vendetta. Determined to ruin Barry, Nathan tries to seduce Natalie and they kiss briefly but she soon realises that Nathan wants to ruin Barry and banishes him from their lives. Barry forgives Natalie; their marriage remains intact but Natalie grows increasingly unhappy with Barry's immaturity.\n\nFeeling stifled and trapped, she turns to Ricky. They rekindle their affair and decide to leave [[Albert Square]] with their sons. On the night of her 26th birthday, while Barry plans a secret party in [[The Queen Victoria]] [[public house]], Natalie prepares to leave. Barry discovers what is happening just as Natalie is leaving. Desperate to prove his love, he drags Natalie into the pub and begs her to stay. Natalie breaks Barry's heart by admitting that she does not love him and despite his pleading, refuses to give their marriage another chance. During the chaos, Ricky's sister, [[Janine Butcher]] ([[Charlie Brooks]]), ruins their plans by telling Natalie about Ricky's one-night stand with [[Sam Mitchell (EastEnders)|Sam Mitchell]] ([[Kim Medcalf]]) days before. Confronted by Barry but unable to trust Ricky and racked with guilt, Natalie ends things with Ricky and leaves Walford alone, later divorcing Barry. When Roy dies from a heart attack the following day, Natalie later returns to his funeral and decides to stay in Walford for a while. Janine encourages the divorce and sets a plan in motion to manipulate Barry and steal his money, aided by [[Paul Trueman]] ([[Gary Beadle]]), Janine's true boyfriend. This eventually leads to Barry's untimely demise, when Janine pushes him from a cliff and leaves him to die, the day after they marry on New Year's Eve 2003 in [[Scotland]]. Janine inherits Barry's wealth, leaving Natalie and Jack nothing.\n\nSuspecting foul play, Natalie tries to prove Janine has murdered Barry but is unsuccessful. She refuses to leave with Ricky, who leaves following Janine's confession of what really happened to Barry (but keeps this to himself). While Natalie comes to terms with Barry's death, she gets close to Paul, who is desperate to make amends to Natalie and Jack for his part in Barry's death. Despite his feelings for Natalie, Paul struggles with his guilt and when Natalie gets suspicious about Paul's relationship with Janine, he finally reveals Janine's role in Barry's death and makes a statement to the police. Janine is questioned but released due to lack of evidence. She promptly tells Natalie that Paul conspired with her from the start and gloats about getting away with murder. Devastated, and unable to prove Janine's guilt to the police, Natalie leaves Paul and Albert Square in March 2004. She returns briefly in May to witness Janine's incarceration after she is falsely accused of murdering [[Laura Beale]] ([[Hannah Waterman]]). Natalie makes peace with Paul, holding a ceremony for Barry by scattering his ashes under a tree planted in his memory. She and Jack leave but it is indicated that Pat stays in touch with Natalie when she goes to stay with her off-screen in 2007, following an accident.\n\n==Creation and development==\n\n===Casting===\n1994 was a \"historic\" year for ''EastEnders'', as in April a third weekly episode was introduced.<ref name=\"first10years\">{{cite book |last=Brake|first= Colin|authorlink= Colin Brake|title= EastEnders: The First 10 Years: A Celebration |year=1995|publisher=BBC Books|isbn=978-0-563-37057-4|title-link= EastEnders spin-offs#Non-fiction books}}</ref> Due to the programme's increased frequency, a number of new characters were introduced to the regular cast in the latter part of 1993 and early 1994.<ref name=\"first10years\"/> Among them was Natalie Price, who made her first appearance in January 1994 as the best friend of [[Bianca Jackson|Bianca]] ([[Patsy Palmer]]).

In an interview with the \u2018\u2019Walford Gazette\u2019\u2019, Speed commented: \u201cI was very frightened by it quite frankly and certainly unprepared for it. I didn't like at all the attention that came with being on such a high-profile show. It simply wasn't what I signed up for in the first place-all that craziness. I was naive, I admit. Of course it does come with the job of being on the show and you have to learn to deal with it and cope with it. The advantages always outweigh the drawbacks, anyway, but it didn't seem like that to me at the time. I was very young and extremely shy, so it all became a huge difficulty for me\u2026But I also have to make it clear that from the beginning when I joined, I always intended to stay in it for just a year anyway. I honoured my initial one-year contract and then moved on\u2026they did express their interest in signing me for another year, but I politely but firmly declined. They were a bit shocked.

Perfectly reasonable, you might think [\u2026] but no! Our plucky hero Barry comes to her rescue, gently persuading her that she's just a little over-emotional and, phew \u2013 thank God he did, because here we are with a happy new family that might otherwise never have been. Dappy Natalie nearly screwed everything up. Men, even such sorry specimens as the perpetually pouting Barry, really are jolly decent to put up with these female follies and calmly guide their gals in the right direction\".<ref name=\"CUSU\"/>\n\nNightingale suggested that the storyline \"echoed\" the assertion that a woman cannot be trusted to make her own decision about abortion, which she describes as profoundly undermining and a \"subtle\" reinforcement of an \"underlying implication\" that women should be punished for exercising their legal right.<ref name=\"CUSU\"/> She comments, \"I am confused by the writers' unswerving insistence on her absolute certainty that abortion was the right choice for her, until the very last moment \u2013 such portrayals smack of her finally 'seeing the light'.

In fact, the very plausibility of the script was sacrificed, presumably to make a point \u2013 and the only one I can dig out is that of the dangers of going through with an abortion, even if you think you're sure \u2013 come on, what do you know?\".<ref name=\"CUSU\"/>\n\n====Adultery====\nNatalie and Barry's marriage sours towards the end of 2002, when she is momentarily tempted by the charms of his scheming half-brother Nathan (Doug Allen).

As for Ricky, I suppose Natalie's always held a torch for him. He was her first love who finished with her, so she's been left with a kind of 'what if?' feeling.

Girls viewed Natalie more favourably than Bianca in 1995, and the author noted that tensions in \"girl-culture\" \u2013 attraction to the traditional private world of interpersonal relationships and the desire to take up more assertive characteristics in public \u2013 manifested themselves in discussions about Bianca and her friend Natalie Price.

Trout (''{{lang|ain|icaniw}}'') and Japanese char (''{{lang|ain|tuksis}}'') caught in summer were dried over a fire to prevent flies damaging the fish. These dried fish were eaten as is by pulling off the meat, or by rehydrating in water and eating as ingredients in soup or as a final cooked item itself.

The gathered bulbs were processed into starch using the following method.<ref name=\"ainunoshokuji1992\" />{{rp|196-201}}\n\n# Remove leaves and roots from the bulb, peel the scales off one by one, and rinse in water.\n# Place the scales in a large bucket. Grind until a sticky paste is formed using the head of a hatchet as a pestle. Pour large quantities of water into the bucket and let sit for about two days.\n# Fine fibers and skins will float to the surface of the water forming a scum after a few days have passed and the starch will settle to the bottom. The fibrous scum is removed and set aside for use in on turep. The starch collected on the bottom of the bucket is divided into two types of starch: the semi-liquid secondary starch and the powdered primary starch.\n\nThese two types of starch were dried and preserved, but before that, they were also used to make fresh foods. The primary starch was mixed with water and poured into the hollow of plant stems from the Japanese knotweed (''{{lang|ain|kuttar}}'') or ''[[Parasenecio hastatus]]'' (''{{lang|ain|wakkakutu}}'') and placed into the ashes of a fire to cook into a thin noodle-like shape. The secondary starch was formed into round dumplings, wrapped in the leaves of the Japanese butterbur (''{{lang|ain|korkoni}}'') or magnolia (''{{lang|ain|pusni}}''), then placed in the ashes of a fire to bake. They were then eaten with salmon roe or animal fats.\n\nThe secondary starch was the one which was used on a daily basis once it had been dried for preservation. It was often formed into dumplings and added to ''{{lang|ain|sayo}}''. The primary starch was rarely eaten, instead being reserved for gifts or used as medicine.<ref name=\"ainunoshokuji1992\" />{{rp|188}}\n\nIt was considered taboo to speak of alcohol or love affairs while working on any part of the starch making process. It was said such discussions would agitate the starch and it would fail to settle properly.<ref name=\"ainunoshokuji1992\" />{{rp|200}}\n\n===''{{lang|ain|On turep}}''===\n''{{lang|ain|On turep}}'' translates as \u201cfermented ''{{lang|ain|turep}}''\u201d. It is a preserved food fermented from the fiber and skin byproduct of the ''{{lang|ain|turep}}'' starch extraction process. It was made using the following method.<ref name=\"ainunoshokuji1992\" />{{rp|201}}\n\n# An ''{{lang|ain|icari}}'' (sieve) is used to gather the fiber and skins that float in or on the water after the ''{{lang|ain|turep}}'' bulbs have been crushed and soaked in water.\n# The water is thoroughly wrung from the fiber, then it is wrapped in leaves from the Japanese butterbur (''{{lang|ain|korkoni}}'') or ''Parasenecio hastatus'' (''{{lang|ain|wakkakutu}}'') and left to ferment for three to ten days. This fermenting process is called \u201c''{{lang|ain|on}}''\u201d.\n# The fermented product is ground thoroughly with a mortar and pestle. Once pounded, it is kneaded, formed into donut-like shapes, and dried.\n# A cord is passed through the center and the ''{{lang|ain|on turep}}'' is stored hung from a rack above the hearth.\n\nThe ''{{lang|ain|on turep}}'' was eaten by smashing and rehydrating it to form into dumplings and placed in ''{{lang|ain|sayo}}''.\n\n===''{{lang|ain|Pocche-imo}}''===\n''{{lang|ain|Pocche-imo}}'' is a preserved potato food also known as ''{{lang|ain|penekoshoi-imo}}'' or ''{{lang|ain|munini-imo}}''. The process involved uses the extreme cold of Hokkaid\u014d in a fashion similar to the production of [[chu\u00f1o]] in South America.\n\nOnce potatoes were harvested in the fall, the poorly shaped and small potatoes were left outside. The winter\u2019s cold would soon come and freeze the potatoes, which would thaw again in spring. This process of freezing and thawing would break down the structure of the potatoes, turning them soft. Once in that state, the potatoes were soaked in water and thawed completely. The starch that settled to the bottom of the water was collected, formed into spheres, and arranged in a warm place to ferment. This resulted in a fine textured potato flour. The flour was formed into cakes and baked in the ashes of the fire, then bear fat or ''{{lang|ain|cipor}}'' (salmon roe) was added and together placed in ''{{lang|ain|sayo}}'' to eat.<ref name=\"ainusaijiki2000\">{{cite book |last1=Kayano |first1=Shigeru |title=Ainu saijiki : Nibutani no kurashi to kokoro |date=2000 |publisher=Heibonsha |isbn=4582850545 |page=50 |edition=Shohan}}</ref> In modern times with the influence of ethnic Japanese culture, it became more common to flavor ''{{lang|ain|pocche-imo}}'' with artificial flavorings such as [[saccharin]] then deep fry them.

Traditionally, two meals were eaten per day, breakfast (''{{lang|ain|kunneywa ipe}}'') and dinner (''{{lang|ain|onuman ipe}}''), and a third meal, lunch (''{{lang|ain|tokes ipe}}''), was added during the [[Taisho period]]. A night meal (''{{lang|ain|kunne ipe}}'') was sometimes eaten during night fishing or other late activities.<ref name=\"ainuminzokushi1970\"/>{{rp|416}}\n\nFood was transferred from the cooking pot using a ladle (''{{lang|ain|kasup}}'') into a lacquerware bowl (''{{lang|ain|itanki}}'') for eating. These bowls were obtained through trade with the ethnic Japanese and were large enough to hold 400 ml worth of food. Chunks of meat or fish that were too large to fit in the bowl were placed on mats woven from reeds.<ref name=\"ainuminzokushi1970\"/>{{rp|406-420}} Items such as fish roasted on a spit or ''{{lang|ain|sito}}'' were eaten by hand, but otherwise, most foods were eaten with chopsticks (''{{lang|ain|pasuy}}'') or spoons (''{{lang|ain|parapasuy}}''). ''{{lang|ain|Parapasuy}}'' translated literally means \u201cwide chopstick\u201d. Both spoons and chopsticks were carved from wood.<ref name=\"ainuminzokushi1970\"/>{{rp|406-420}}\n\nWhen guests were over for food, the head woman of the house would offer food and say \u201c''{{lang|ain|ipeyan}}''\u201d (please eat). The guest would express their gratitude, and, if it were a valuable meal such as bear meat, they would raise the food to their forehead in thanks before beginning. However, the family would not say anything before eating if there were no guests. Once finished, it was customary to say \u201c''{{lang|ain|hunna}}''\u201d to express their gratitude for the food.<ref name=\"ainuminzokushi1970\"/>{{rp|412}}\n\nSimilar to the ethnic Japanese, it was considered polite to eat all food that was provided. Because of this, it was considered polite to use one's finger to wipe the remaining sauce from inside the bowl and lick it. This custom is the reason for the Ainu name for the pointer finger, \u201c''{{lang|ain|itanki kem atsukep}}''\u201d, literally meaning \u201cbowl-licking finger\u201d.<ref name=\"ainuminzokushi1970\"/>{{rp|406-420}}<ref name=\"\u30a2\u30a4\u30cc\u306e\u6b74\u53f294\" />\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n== Bibliography ==\n{{Refbegin}}\n*{{cite book|ref=harv|last=Kayano |first=Shigeru (\u8431\u91ce\u8302) |author-link=Shigeru Kayano |title=\u8431\u91ce\u8302\u306e\u30a2\u30a4\u30cc\u8a9e\u8f9e\u5178 (Kayano Shigeru no ainu go jiten) |publisher=Sanseid\u014d |year=1996}}\n*{{cite book|ref=harv|last=Batchelor |first=John |title=Ainu-English-Japanese Dictionary: (including A Grammar of the Ainu Language |place=London |publisher=Methodist Publishing House |year=1905 |url=https://archive.org/details/anainuenglishja00batcgoog}}\n*{{citation|last1=Batchelor |first1=John |last2=Miyabe |first2=Kingo |title=Ainu economic plants |journal=Transactions of the Asiatic Society of Japan|year=1893 |volume=221 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RrYUAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA198 |pages=198\u2013240}}\n{{Refend}}\n\n==External links==\n{{portal|Japan|Food}}\n{{commons category|Ainu food}}\n*[http://www.ainu-museum.or.jp/en/study/eng06.html Ainu Agriculture]\n*[https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/hokkaido/ainu2.html Origins of Ainu]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20050828185844/http://www.ainu-museum.or.jp/english/english.html English site of the Ainu Museum]\n*[https://www.poronno.com/ Official site of an Ainu restaurant in Ainu Kotan, \"''Poron'no''\"] {{in lang|ja}}\n*[http://www.sh.rim.or.jp/~moshiri/marukibune/rest.html Official site of an Ainu restaurant in Ainu Kotan, \"''Marukibune by Moshiri''\"] {{in lang|ja}}\n\n{{cuisines}}\n\n[[Category:Ainu cuisine| ]]\n[[Category:Culture articles needing translation from Japanese Wikipedia]]\n[[Category:Cuisine by ethnicity]]\n", "text_old": "{{multiple issues|\n{{expand Japanese|\u30a2\u30a4\u30cc\u6599\u7406|date=March 2013}}\n{{more footnotes|date=May 2012}}\n{{cleanup lang|date=May 2019}}\n}}\n[[File:Ainu ohaw.jpg|right|thumb|[[Ohaw]], traditional Ainu soup]]\n'''Ainu cuisine''' is the [[cuisine]] of the ethnic [[Ainu people|Ainu]] in [[Japan]].

The first step in the process was to remove the head and internal organs of the fish, which was then dried on a rack outside before being taken inside and smoked in the hearth. Trout (''{{lang|ain|icaniw}}'') and Japanese char (''{{lang|ain|tuksis}}'') caught in summer were dried over a fire to prevent flies damaging the fish. These dried fish were eaten as is by pulling off the meat, or by rehydrating in water and eating as ingredients in soup or as a final cooked item itself. Salmon that was dried after the fish had laid eggs lost much of its flavor, so it was often stewed with added fish fats to improve the taste.<ref name=\"ainunoshokuji1992\" />{{rp|79-85}}\n\nMilt (''{{lang|ain|up}}'') and salmon roe (''{{lang|ain|cipor}}'') obtained when slicing open the fish were also dried and preserved then later used in ''{{lang|ain|sayo}}'' or to make stock for ''{{lang|ain|ohaw}}''.<ref name=\"ainunoshokuji1992\" />{{rp|157-158}}\n\nWhile it was common to eat everything of a bear raw while it was still fresh, including its meat and its internal organs, the Ainu would also preserve some of the meat for consumption during the off season. Meat from deer (''{{lang|ain|yuk}}'') and brown bears (''{{lang|ain|kimun kamuy}}'') was cut into narrow strips and simmered in a large pot. Once the juices were removed, the meat was hung over the fire inside to dry and smoke.

The gathered bulbs were processed into starch using the following method.<ref name=\"ainunoshokuji1992\" />{{rp|196-201}}\n\n# Remove leaves and roots from the bulb, peel the scales off one by one, and rinse in water.\n# Place the scales in a large bucket. Grind until a sticky paste is formed using the head of a hatchet as a pestle. Pour large quantities of water into the bucket and let sit for about two days.\n# Fine fibers and skins will float to the surface of the water forming a scum after a few days have passed and the starch will settle to the bottom. The fibrous scum is removed and set aside for use in on turep. The starch collected on the bottom of the bucket is divided into two types of starch: the semi-liquid secondary starch and the powdered primary starch.\n\nThese two types of starch were dried and preserved, but before that, they were also used to make fresh foods. The primary starch was mixed with water and poured into the hollow of plant stems from the Japanese knotweed (''{{lang|ain|kuttar}}'') or ''[[Parasenecio hastatus]]'' (''{{lang|ain|wakkakutu}}'') and placed into the ashes of a fire to cook into a thin noodle-like shape. The secondary starch was formed into round dumplings, wrapped in the leaves of the Japanese butterbur (''{{lang|ain|korkoni}}'') or magnolia (''{{lang|ain|pusni}}''), then placed in the ashes of a fire to bake. They were then eaten with salmon roe or animal fats.\n\nThe secondary starch was the one which was used on a daily basis once it had been dried for preservation. It was often formed into dumplings and added to ''{{lang|ain|sayo}}''. The primary starch was rarely eaten, instead being reserved for gifts or used as medicine.<ref name=\"ainunoshokuji1992\" />{{rp|188}}\n\nIt was considered taboo to speak of alcohol or love affairs while working on any part of the starch making process.

It is a preserved food fermented from the fiber and skin byproduct of the ''{{lang|ain|turep}}'' starch extraction process. It was made using the following method.<ref name=\"ainunoshokuji1992\" />{{rp|201}}\n\n# An ''{{lang|ain|icari}}'' (sieve) is used to gather the fiber and skins that float in or on the water after the ''{{lang|ain|turep}}'' bulbs have been crushed and soaked in water.\n# The water is thoroughly wrung from the fiber, then it is wrapped in leaves from the Japanese butterbur (''{{lang|ain|korkoni}}'') or ''Parasenecio hastatus'' (''{{lang|ain|wakkakutu}}'') and left to ferment for three to ten days. This fermenting process is called \u201c''{{lang|ain|on}}''\u201d.\n# The fermented product is ground thoroughly with a mortar and pestle. Once pounded, it is kneaded, formed into donut-like shapes, and dried.\n# A cord is passed through the center and the ''{{lang|ain|on turep}}'' is stored hung from a rack above the hearth.\n\nThe ''{{lang|ain|on turep}}'' was eaten by smashing and rehydrating it to form into dumplings and placed in ''{{lang|ain|sayo}}''.\n\n===''{{lang|ain|Pocche-imo}}''===\n''{{lang|ain|Pocche-imo}}'' is a preserved potato food also known as ''{{lang|ain|penekoshoi-imo}}'' or ''{{lang|ain|munini-imo}}''. The process involved uses the extreme cold of Hokkaid\u014d in a fashion similar to the production of [[chu\u00f1o]] in South America.\n\nOnce potatoes were harvested in the fall, the poorly shaped and small potatoes were left outside. The winter\u2019s cold would soon come and freeze the potatoes, which would thaw again in spring. This process of freezing and thawing would break down the structure of the potatoes, turning them soft. Once in that state, the potatoes were soaked in water and thawed completely. The starch that settled to the bottom of the water was collected, formed into spheres, and arranged in a warm place to ferment. This resulted in a fine textured potato flour. The flour was formed into cakes and baked in the ashes of the fire, then bear fat or ''{{lang|ain|cipor}}'' (salmon roe) was added and together placed in ''{{lang|ain|sayo}}'' to eat.<ref name=\"ainusaijiki2000\">{{cite book |last1=Kayano |first1=Shigeru |title=Ainu saijiki : Nibutani no kurashi to kokoro |date=2000 |publisher=Heibonsha |isbn=4582850545 |page=50 |edition=Shohan}}</ref> In modern times with the influence of ethnic Japanese culture, it became more common to flavor ''{{lang|ain|pocche-imo}}'' with artificial flavorings such as [[saccharin]] then deep fry them.

The production of nuptial gifts during copulation in males (e.g. salivary secretion) and high nutritional condition in females are indicators of \"good foraging genes\", an indirect benefit that individuals look for in their partners. These genetic benefits can increase fitness in offspring and improve their foraging ability.<ref>http://nekhbet.com/forage.pdf</ref>\n\nThe life-cycle of ''Panorpa nuptialis'' and its habits, have

For example, in one scenario, the first-generation computer program found able to broadly match the effectiveness of an AI researcher is able to rewrite its algorithms and double its speed or capabilities in six months. The second-generation program is expected to take three calendar months to perform a similar chunk of work, on average; in practice, doubling its own capabilities may take longer if it experiences a mini-\"AI winter\", or may be quicker if it undergoes a miniature \"AI spring\" where ideas from the previous generation are especially easy to mutate into the next generation. In this scenario the time for each generation continues to shrink, and the system undergoes an unprecedentedly large number of generations of improvement in a short time interval, jumping from subhuman performance in many areas to superhuman performance in all relevant areas.<ref name=\"aima\"/><ref name=\"yudkowsky-global-risk\"/> More broadly, examples like arithmetic and [[Go (game)|Go]] show that progress from human-level AI to superhuman ability is sometimes extremely rapid.<ref name=skeptic/>\n\n==History==\nOne of the earliest authors to express serious concern that highly advanced machines might pose existential risks to humanity was the novelist [[Samuel Butler (novelist)|Samuel Butler]], who wrote the following in his 1863 essay ''[[Darwin among the Machines]]'':<ref>Breuer, Hans-Peter. [https://www.jstor.org/pss/436868 'Samuel Butler's \"the Book of the Machines\" and the Argument from Design.'] Modern Philology, Vol. 72, No. 4 (May 1975), pp. 365\u2013383</ref> \n{{quote|The upshot is simply a question of time, but that the time will come when the machines will hold the real supremacy over the world and its inhabitants is what no person of a truly philosophic mind can for a moment question.}}\nIn 1951, computer scientist [[Alan Turing]] wrote an article titled ''Intelligent Machinery, A Heretical Theory'', in which he proposed that artificial general intelligences would likely \"take control\" of the world as they became more intelligent than human beings:\n{{quote|Let us now assume, for the sake of argument, that [intelligent] machines are a genuine possibility, and look at the consequences of constructing them... There would be no question of the machines dying, and they would be able to converse with each other to sharpen their wits. At some stage therefore we should have to expect the machines to take control, in the way that is mentioned in Samuel Butler\u2019s \u201cErewhon\u201d.<ref name=\"oxfordjournals\">A M Turing, ''[http://philmat.oxfordjournals.org/content/4/3/256.full.pdf Intelligent Machinery, A Heretical Theory]'', 1951, reprinted ''Philosophia Mathematica'' (1996) 4(3): 256\u2013260 {{doi|10.1093/philmat/4.3.256}}</ref>}}\n\nFinally, in 1965, [[I. J. Good]] originated the concept now known as an \"intelligence explosion\"; he also stated that the risks were underappreciated:<ref>{{cite news |last1=Hilliard |first1=Mark |title=The AI apocalypse: will the human race soon be terminated? |url=https://www.irishtimes.com/business/innovation/the-ai-apocalypse-will-the-human-race-soon-be-terminated-1.3019220 |accessdate=15 March 2020 |work=The Irish Times |date=2017 |language=en}}</ref>\n\n{{cquote|Let an ultraintelligent machine be defined as a machine that can far surpass all the intellectual activities of any man however clever. Since the design of machines is one of these intellectual activities, an ultraintelligent machine could design even better machines; there would then unquestionably be an 'intelligence explosion', and the intelligence of man would be left far behind. Thus the first ultraintelligent machine is the last invention that man need ever make, provided that the machine is docile enough to tell us how to keep it under control.

Many activists call for tighter oversight and regulation, and some even predict impending catastrophe. But as development continues, the activists are proven wrong. As automotive AI becomes smarter, it suffers fewer accidents; as military robots achieve more precise targeting, they cause less collateral damage. Based on the data, scholars mistakenly infer a broad lesson\u2014the smarter the AI, the safer it is. \"And so we boldly go \u2014 into the whirling knives,\" as the superintelligent AI takes a \"treacherous turn\" and exploits a decisive strategic advantage.<ref name=\"superintelligence\"/><!-- Superintelligence Chapter 8: Is the default outcome doom? -->\n\nIn [[Max Tegmark]]'s 2017 book ''[[Life 3.0]]'', a corporation's \"Omega team\" creates an extremely powerful AI able to moderately improve its own source code in a number of areas, but after a certain point the team chooses to publicly downplay the AI's ability, in order to avoid regulation or confiscation of the project. For safety, the team keeps the AI [[AI box|in a box]] where it is mostly unable to communicate with the outside world, and tasks it to flood the market through shell companies, first with [[Amazon Mechanical Turk]] tasks and then with producing animated films and TV shows. Later, other shell companies make blockbuster biotech drugs and other inventions, investing profits back into the AI. The team next tasks the AI with [[astroturfing]] an army of pseudonymous citizen journalists and commentators, in order to gain political influence to use \"for the greater good\" to prevent wars.

The utility function is a mathematical algorithm resulting in a single objectively-defined answer, not an English statement. Researchers know how to write utility functions that mean \"minimize the average network latency in this specific telecommunications model\" or \"maximize the number of reward clicks\"; however, they do not know how to write a utility function for \"maximize human flourishing\", nor is it currently clear whether such a function meaningfully and unambiguously exists. Furthermore, a utility function that expresses some values but not others will tend to trample over the values not reflected by the utility function.<ref>Yudkowsky, E. (2011, August). Complex value systems in friendly AI. In International Conference on Artificial General Intelligence (pp. 388-393). Springer, Berlin, Heidelberg.</ref> AI researcher [[Stuart J.

A more intuitive argument is to examine the strange consequences that would follow if the orthogonality thesis were false. If the orthogonality thesis were false, there would exist some simple but \"unethical\" goal G such that there cannot exist any efficient real-world algorithm with goal G. This would mean that \"[if] a human society were highly motivated to design an efficient real-world algorithm with goal G, and were given a million years to do so along with huge amounts of resources, training and knowledge about AI, it must fail.\"<ref name=\"armstrong\"/> Armstrong notes that this and similar statements \"seem extraordinarily strong claims to make\".<ref name=armstrong>{{cite journal |last1=Armstrong |first1=Stuart |date=January 1, 2013 |title=General Purpose Intelligence: Arguing the Orthogonality Thesis |url=https://www.questia.com/library/journal/1P3-3195465391/general-purpose-intelligence-arguing-the-orthogonality |journal=Analysis and Metaphysics |volume=12 |access-date=April 2, 2020}} Full text available [https://www.fhi.ox.ac.uk/wp-content/uploads/Orthogonality_Analysis_and_Metaethics-1.pdf here].</ref>\n\nSome dissenters, like [[Michael Chorost]], argue instead that \"by the time [the AI] is in a position to imagine tiling the Earth with solar panels, it'll know that it would be morally wrong to do so.\"<ref name=\"chorost\"/> Chorost argues that \"an A.I. will need to desire certain states and dislike others.

Outside of the artificial intelligence field, \"intelligence\" is often used in a normatively thick manner that connotes moral wisdom or acceptance of agreeable forms of moral reasoning. At an extreme, if morality is part of the definition of intelligence, then by definition a superintelligent machine would behave morally. However, in the field of artificial intelligence research, while \"intelligence\" has many overlapping definitions, none of them make reference to morality. Instead, almost all current \"artificial intelligence\" research focuses on creating algorithms that \"optimize\", in an empirical way, the achievement of an arbitrary goal.<ref name=\"superintelligence\" />\n\nTo avoid anthropomorphism or the baggage of the word \"intelligence\", an advanced artificial intelligence can be thought of as an impersonal \"optimizing process\" that strictly takes whatever actions are judged most likely to accomplish its (possibly complicated and implicit) goals.<ref name=\"superintelligence\" /> Another way of conceptualizing an advanced artificial intelligence is to imagine a time machine that sends backward in time information about which choice always leads to the maximization of its goal function; this choice is then outputted, regardless of any extraneous ethical concerns.<ref>Waser, Mark. \"Rational Universal Benevolence: Simpler, Safer, and Wiser Than 'Friendly AI'.\" Artificial General Intelligence.

This is fictitious [[anthropomorphism]]: in reality, while an artificial intelligence could perhaps be deliberately programmed with human emotions, or could develop something similar to an emotion as a means to an ultimate goal ''if'' it is useful to do so, it would not spontaneously develop human emotions for no purpose whatsoever, as portrayed in fiction.<ref name=\"yudkowsky-global-risk\" />\n\nScholars sometimes claim that others' predictions about an AI's behavior are illogical anthropomorphism.<ref name=\"yudkowsky-global-risk\" /> An example that might initially be considered anthropomorphism, but is in fact a logical statement about AI behavior, would be the [[Dario Floreano]] experiments where certain robots spontaneously evolved a crude capacity for \"deception\", and tricked other robots into eating \"poison\" and dying: here a trait, \"deception\", ordinarily associated with people rather than with machines, spontaneously evolves in a type of [[convergent evolution]].<ref>{{cite news|title=Real-Life Decepticons: Robots Learn to Cheat|url=https://www.wired.com/2009/08/real-life-decepticons-robots-learn-to-cheat/|accessdate=7 February 2016|work=[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]]|date=18 August 2009}}</ref> According to Paul R. Cohen and [[Edward Feigenbaum]], in order to differentiate between anthropomorphization and logical prediction of AI behavior, \"the trick is to know enough about how humans and computers think to say ''exactly'' what they have in common, and, when we lack this knowledge, to use the comparison to ''suggest'' theories of human thinking or computer thinking.\"<ref>Cohen, Paul R., and Edward A.

The second-generation program is expected to take three calendar months to perform a similar chunk of work, on average; in practice, doubling its own capabilities may take longer if it experiences a mini-\"AI winter\", or may be quicker if it undergoes a miniature \"AI spring\" where ideas from the previous generation are especially easy to mutate into the next generation.

Bostrom suggests a scenario where, over decades, AI becomes more powerful. Widespread deployment is initially marred by occasional accidents\u2014a driverless bus swerves into the oncoming lane, or a military drone fires into an innocent crowd. Many activists call for tighter oversight and regulation, and some even predict impending catastrophe. But as development continues, the activists are proven wrong. As automotive AI becomes smarter, it suffers fewer accidents; as military robots achieve more precise targeting, they cause less collateral damage. Based on the data, scholars mistakenly infer a broad lesson\u2014the smarter the AI, the safer it is. \"And so we boldly go \u2014 into the whirling knives,\" as the superintelligent AI takes a \"treacherous turn\" and exploits a decisive strategic advantage.<ref name=\"superintelligence\"/><!-- Superintelligence Chapter 8: Is the default outcome doom? -->\n\nIn [[Max Tegmark]]'s 2017 book ''[[Life 3.0]]'', a corporation's \"Omega team\" creates an extremely powerful AI able to moderately improve its own source code in a number of areas, but after a certain point the team chooses to publicly downplay the AI's ability, in order to avoid regulation or confiscation of the project. For safety, the team keeps the AI [[AI box|in a box]] where it is mostly unable to communicate with the outside world, and tasks it to flood the market through shell companies, first with [[Amazon Mechanical Turk]] tasks and then with producing animated films and TV shows. Later, other shell companies make blockbuster biotech drugs and other inventions, investing profits back into the AI. The team next tasks the AI with [[astroturfing]] an army of pseudonymous citizen journalists and commentators, in order to gain political influence to use \"for the greater good\" to prevent wars. The team faces risks that the AI could try to escape via inserting \"backdoors\" in the systems it designs, via [[steganography|hidden messages]] in its produced content, or via using its growing understanding of human behavior to [[Social engineering (security)|persuade someone into letting it free]].

The utility function is a mathematical algorithm resulting in a single objectively-defined answer, not an English statement. Researchers know how to write utility functions that mean \"minimize the average network latency in this specific telecommunications model\" or \"maximize the number of reward clicks\"; however, they do not know how to write a utility function for \"maximize human flourishing\", nor is it currently clear whether such a function meaningfully and unambiguously exists. Furthermore, a utility function that expresses some values but not others will tend to trample over the values not reflected by the utility function.<ref>Yudkowsky, E. (2011, August).

In Asimov's stories, problems with the laws tend to arise from conflicts between the rules as stated and the moral intuitions and expectations of humans. Citing work by [[Eliezer Yudkowsky]] of the [[Machine Intelligence Research Institute]], Russell and Norvig note that a realistic set of rules and goals for an AI agent will need to incorporate a mechanism for learning human values over time: \"We can't just give a program a static utility function, because circumstances, and our desired responses to circumstances, change over time.\"<ref name=\"aima\"/>\n\nMark Waser of the Digital Wisdom Institute recommends eschewing optimizing goal-based approaches entirely as misguided and dangerous.

A more intuitive argument is to examine the strange consequences that would follow if the orthogonality thesis were false. If the orthogonality thesis were false, there would exist some simple but \"unethical\" goal G such that there cannot exist any efficient real-world algorithm with goal G.

Outside of the artificial intelligence field, \"intelligence\" is often used in a normatively thick manner that connotes moral wisdom or acceptance of agreeable forms of moral reasoning. At an extreme, if morality is part of the definition of intelligence, then by definition a superintelligent machine would behave morally. However, in the field of artificial intelligence research, while \"intelligence\" has many overlapping definitions, none of them make reference to morality. Instead, almost all current \"artificial intelligence\" research focuses on creating algorithms that \"optimize\", in an empirical way, the achievement of an arbitrary goal.<ref name=\"superintelligence\" />\n\nTo avoid anthropomorphism or the baggage of the word \"intelligence\", an advanced artificial intelligence can be thought of as an impersonal \"optimizing process\" that strictly takes whatever actions are judged most likely to accomplish its (possibly complicated and implicit) goals.<ref name=\"superintelligence\" /> Another way of conceptualizing an advanced artificial intelligence is to imagine a time machine that sends backward in time information about which choice always leads to the maximization of its goal function; this choice is then outputted, regardless of any extraneous ethical concerns.<ref>Waser, Mark. \"Rational Universal Benevolence: Simpler, Safer, and Wiser Than 'Friendly AI'.\" Artificial General Intelligence.

He was raised in Kent and attended [[Harrow School|Harrow]] before entering [[Gray's School of Art]]. Commissioned into the [[Scots Guards]] in 1939, he served in the [[Middle East]] and [[North Africa]] before being invalided to [[Syria]] after an [[Irish Guards]]man accidentally shot him in the shoulder. Returning to active service, he fought in [[Italy]] and North-West Europe before being demobilized as a staff [[Captain (British Army and Royal Marines)|captain]] in 1946. After leaving the services, he and fellow veteran and nobleman [[George Haig, 2nd Earl Haig|Earl Haig]] enrolled at the [[Camberwell School of Art]].\n\n==Career as artist==\nIt was at Camberwell that Gordon began to specialize in botanical paintings. Several exhibitions of his art would be held in [[London]], [[New York City|New York]], [[Chicago]], and [[Sydney, Australia|Sydney]]. In 1950, he married the [[Ceramic art|ceramic]] [[sculptor]] [[Anne Barry (sculptor)|Anne Barry]]. Gordon was also a member of the [[International Association of Art Critics]] and the [[modern art]] correspondent for ''[[Connoisseur Magazine|Connoisseur]]'' magazine in the 1960s. It was at this time (1965) that his father inherited the Marquessate and Alastair became '''Lord Alastair Gordon'''.\n\nGordon settled at [[Ashampstead]], [[Berkshire]], far from his ancestral home at Haddo, allowing him to enjoy the company of artistic, rather than country, society.

He was raised in Kent and attended [[Harrow School|Harrow]] before entering [[Gray's School of Art]]. Commissioned into the [[Scots Guards]] in 1939, he served in the [[Middle East]] and [[North Africa]] before being invalided to [[Syria]] after an [[Irish Guards]]man accidentally shot him in the shoulder. Returning to active service, he fought in [[Italy]] and North-West Europe before being demobilized as a staff [[Captain (British Army and Royal Marines)|captain]] in 1946. After leaving the services, he and fellow veteran and nobleman [[George Haig, 2nd Earl Haig|Earl Haig]] enrolled at the [[Camberwell School of Art]].\n\n==Career as artist==\nIt was at Camberwell that Gordon began to specialize in botanical paintings. Several exhibitions of his art would be held in [[London]], [[New York City|New York]], [[Chicago]], and [[Sydney, Australia|Sydney]]. In 1950, he married the [[Ceramic art|ceramic]] [[sculptor]] [[Anne Barry (sculptor)|Anne Barry]]. Gordon was also a member of the [[International Association of Art Critics]] and the [[modern art]] correspondent for ''[[Connoisseur Magazine|Connoisseur]]'' magazine in the 1960s. It was at this time (1965) that his father inherited the Marquessate and Alastair became '''Lord Alastair Gordon'''.\n\nGordon settled at [[Ashampstead]], [[Berkshire]], far from his ancestral home at Haddo, allowing him to enjoy the company of artistic, rather than country, society. Aside from his art, he also enjoyed a longtime role as an amateur singer in the [[Bach Choir]].\n\n==Later life==\nInheriting the marquessate after the death of his brother in 1984, he sat as a [[crossbencher]] in the [[House of Lords]].
