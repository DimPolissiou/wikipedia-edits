For a selective list of his works, grouped by genre, see [[List of compositions by Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart]].}}\n\nThe '''K\u00f6chel catalogue''' ({{lang-de|K\u00f6chel-Verzeichnis|links=no}}) is a [[Chronology|chronological]] catalogue of compositions by [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart]], originally created by [[Ludwig Ritter von K\u00f6chel|Ludwig von K\u00f6chel]], in which the entries are abbreviated ''K.'', or ''KV''. The numbers of the K\u00f6chel catalogue reflect the continuing establishment of a complete chronology of Mozart's works, and provide a shorthand reference to the compositions.\n\nAccording to K\u00f6chel's counting, ''[[Requiem (Mozart)|Requiem in D minor]]'' is the 626th piece Mozart composed, thus is designated ''K.&nbsp;626''; however, his original catalogue (1862) of Mozart has been twice revised, and some works have had three KV. numbers, e.g. Mozart's [[Horn Concerto No. 1 (Mozart)|Horn Concerto No. 1, K.&nbsp;(412+514)/386b]].\n\n==History==\nIn the decades after Mozart's death there were several attempts to catalogue his compositions, for example by [[Franz Glei\u00dfner]] and [[Johann Anton Andr\u00e9]] (published in 1833), but it was not until 1862 that Ludwig von K\u00f6chel succeeded in producing a comprehensive listing. K\u00f6chel's 551-page catalogue was titled ''Chronologisch-thematisches Verzeichnis s\u00e4mm<!-- not a typo -->tlicher Tonwerke W. A. Mozarts'' (''Chronological-thematic Catalogue of the Complete Musical Works of W. A. Mozart'').<ref>{{cite book |publisher=[[Breitkopf & H\u00e4rtel]] |last=K\u00f6chel |first=Ludwig Ritter von |authorlink=Ludwig Ritter von K\u00f6chel |title=Chronologisch-thematisches Verzeichniss s\u00e4mmtlicher Tonwerke Wolfgang Amade Mozart's |location=Leipzig |year=1862 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kV4VAAAAYAAJ |oclc=3309798 |archiveurl=https://archive.org/details/chronologischth01kcgoog |archivedate=12 February 2008 |language=German}}</ref> K\u00f6chel attempted to arrange the works in chronological order, but many compositions written before 1784 could only be estimated, although [[Leopold Mozart]] had compiled a partial list of his son's earlier works; Mozart's catalogue of his own compositions (begun in February 1784 with [[K. 449]]) allows relatively precise dating of many of his later works.  The catalogue included the opening bars of each piece, known as an [[incipit]]. K\u00f6chel divided the corpus into a main chronology of 626 works, and five appendices ({{lang|de|[[Anhang (disambiguation)|Anhang]]}} in German, abbreviated to Anh.) The appendices (Anh. I-V) included:\n*I \u2013 Lost authentic works\n*II \u2013 Fragments by Mozart\n*III \u2013 Works by Mozart transcribed by others\n*IV \u2013 Doubtful works\n*V \u2013 Misattributed works\n\nSince K\u00f6chel published his original catalogue in 1863 (now referred to as K{{sup|1}}), the dating of Mozart's compositions has been subject to constant revision. Many more pieces have since been found, re-dated, re-attributed and re-numbered, requiring three revised editions of the catalogue. Subsequent editions \u2013 especially the third edition (K{{sup|3}}) by [[Alfred Einstein]] (1937), and the sixth edition (K{{sup|6}}) by [[Franz Giegling]], {{ill|Gerd Sievers|de}}, and {{ill|Alexander Weinmann|de}} (1964) \u2013 have reflected attempts to arrange the growing list of works in a more accurate chronological order, according to various levels of scholarship.\n\nA major shortcoming of K{{sup|1}} was that there was no room to expand the strictly sequential numbering in the main catalogue to allow for any new discoveries or further reassessment of existing works. For the 1937 edition (K{{sup|3}}) Einstein (following the analyses of [[T\u00e9odor de Wyzewa|Th\u00e9odore de Wyzewa]] and Georges de St. Foix) reassigned a number of works from the original K{{sup|1}} appendices into the main catalogue by interpolating new numbers into the main sequence with a lower-case letter suffix. In K{{sup|6}} some of these were reassessed in the light of scholarship since 1937 and returned to the re-worked appendices:\n* K. 626a\n** K. 626a I \u2013 64 cadenzas by Mozart to his own keyboard concertos\n** K. 626a II \u2013 Cadenzas by Mozart to keyboard concertos by other composers\n* K. 626b \u2013 42 sketches & other fragments by Mozart (replacing K{{sup|3}} Anh. II)\n* Anh. A \u2013 Copies by Mozart of other composers' works \n* Anh. B \u2013 Works by Mozart transcribed by others\n* Anh. C \u2013 Doubtful and misattributed vocal (C.1\u201310) and instrumental (C.11-30) works\n\nFor example, the Divertimento for Wind Octet in E{{music|flat}} was numbered Anh.&nbsp;226 in K{{sup|1}}; Einstein placed it in the K{{sup|3}} main catalogue as K.&nbsp;196e, between K.&nbsp;196 and K.&nbsp;197; K{{sup|6}} reassigned it again to the 'doubtful' appendix C as Anh. C 17.01. Some works in Anh. A have been identified since 1965 as by Leopold Mozart. Many works in Anh. C have since been more reliably assigned to other composers, or to Mozart himself.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+ Editions of K\u00f6chel's catalogue\n|-\n!Edition!!Year!!Editors!!Note \n|-\n|1||1862||[[Ludwig Ritter von K\u00f6chel|Ludwig von K\u00f6chel]]||Original\n|-\n|2||1905||[[Paul von Waldersee]]||Limited revision: mostly addition of pieces that had since come to light\n|-\n|3||1937||rowspan=3|[[Alfred Einstein]]||\n|-\n|4||1958||rowspan=2|unchanged reprint\n|-\n|5||1961\n|-\n|6||1964|| rowspan=\"3\" |Franz Giegling, Gerd Sievers, and Alexander Weinmann||\n|-\n|7||1965||rowspan=2|unchanged reprint\n|-\n|8||1983\n|}\n\n==List of existing Mozart compositions==\nTo maintain as much of the original K-numbering of the list as possible, while re-ordering in the revised, chronological sequence, letters were added to the new numbers.

For a selective list of his works, grouped by genre, see [[List of compositions by Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart]].}}\n\nThe '''K\u00f6chel catalogue''' ({{lang-de|K\u00f6chel-Verzeichnis|links=no}}) is a [[Chronology|chronological]] catalogue of compositions by [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart]], originally created by [[Ludwig Ritter von K\u00f6chel|Ludwig von K\u00f6chel]], in which the entries are abbreviated ''K.'', or ''KV''. The numbers of the K\u00f6chel catalogue reflect the continuing establishment of a complete chronology of Mozart's works, and provide a shorthand reference to the compositions.\n\nAccording to K\u00f6chel's counting, ''[[Requiem (Mozart)|Requiem in D minor]]'' is the 626th piece Mozart composed, thus is designated ''K.&nbsp;626''; however, his original catalogue (1862) of Mozart has been twice revised, and some works have had three KV. numbers, e.g. Mozart's [[Horn Concerto No. 1 (Mozart)|Horn Concerto No. 1, K.&nbsp;(412+514)/386b]].\n\n==History==\nIn the decades after Mozart's death there were several attempts to catalogue his compositions, for example by [[Franz Glei\u00dfner]] and [[Johann Anton Andr\u00e9]] (published in 1833), but it was not until 1862 that Ludwig von K\u00f6chel succeeded in producing a comprehensive listing. K\u00f6chel's 551-page catalogue was titled ''Chronologisch-thematisches Verzeichnis s\u00e4mm<!-- not a typo -->tlicher Tonwerke W. A. Mozarts'' (''Chronological-thematic Catalogue of the Complete Musical Works of W. A. Mozart'').<ref>{{cite book |publisher=[[Breitkopf & H\u00e4rtel]] |last=K\u00f6chel |first=Ludwig Ritter von |authorlink=Ludwig Ritter von K\u00f6chel |title=Chronologisch-thematisches Verzeichniss s\u00e4mmtlicher Tonwerke Wolfgang Amade Mozart's |location=Leipzig |year=1862 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kV4VAAAAYAAJ |oclc=3309798 |archiveurl=https://archive.org/details/chronologischth01kcgoog |archivedate=12 February 2008 |language=German}}</ref> K\u00f6chel attempted to arrange the works in chronological order, but many compositions written before 1784 could only be estimated, although [[Leopold Mozart]] had compiled a partial list of his son's earlier works; Mozart's catalogue of his own compositions (begun in February 1784 with [[K. 449]]) allows relatively precise dating of many of his later works.  The catalogue included the opening bars of each piece, known as an [[incipit]]. K\u00f6chel divided the corpus into a main chronology of 626 works, and five appendices ({{lang|de|[[Anhang (disambiguation)|Anhang]]}} in German, abbreviated to Anh.) The appendices (Anh. I-V) included:\n*I \u2013 Lost authentic works\n*II \u2013 Fragments by Mozart\n*III \u2013 Works by Mozart transcribed by others\n*IV \u2013 Doubtful works\n*V \u2013 Misattributed works\n\nSince K\u00f6chel published his original catalogue in 1863 (now referred to as K{{sup|1}}), the dating of Mozart's compositions has been subject to constant revision. Many more pieces have since been found, re-dated, re-attributed and re-numbered, requiring three revised editions of the catalogue. Subsequent editions \u2013 especially the third edition (K{{sup|3}}) by [[Alfred Einstein]] (1937), and the sixth edition (K{{sup|6}}) by [[Franz Giegling]], {{ill|Gerd Sievers|de}}, and {{ill|Alexander Weinmann|de}} (1964) \u2013 have reflected attempts to arrange the growing list of works in a more accurate chronological order, according to various levels of scholarship.\n\nA major shortcoming of K{{sup|1}} was that there was no room to expand the strictly sequential numbering in the main catalogue to allow for any new discoveries or further reassessment of existing works. For the 1937 edition (K{{sup|3}}) Einstein (following the analyses of [[T\u00e9odor de Wyzewa|Th\u00e9odore de Wyzewa]] and Georges de St. Foix) reassigned a number of works from the original K{{sup|1}} appendices into the main catalogue by interpolating new numbers into the main sequence with a lower-case letter suffix. In K{{sup|6}} some of these were reassessed in the light of scholarship since 1937 and returned to the re-worked appendices:\n* K. 626a\n** K. 626a I \u2013 64 cadenzas by Mozart to his own keyboard concertos\n** K. 626a II \u2013 Cadenzas by Mozart to keyboard concertos by other composers\n* K. 626b \u2013 42 sketches & other fragments by Mozart (replacing K{{sup|3}} Anh.

C \u2013 Doubtful and misattributed vocal (C.1\u201310) and instrumental (C.11-30) works\n\nFor example, the Divertimento for Wind Octet in E{{music|flat}} was numbered Anh.&nbsp;226 in K{{sup|1}}; Einstein placed it in the K{{sup|3}} main catalogue as K.&nbsp;196e, between K.&nbsp;196 and K.&nbsp;197; K{{sup|6}} reassigned it again to the 'doubtful' appendix C as Anh. C 17.01. Some works in Anh. A have been identified since 1965 as by Leopold Mozart. Many works in Anh.

And I'm going from my valley. And this time, I shall never return.\" The valley and its villages are now blackened by the dust of the coal mines that surround the area.\n\nA young Huw ([[Roddy McDowall]]), the youngest child of Gwilym Morgan ([[Donald Crisp]]), walks home with his father to meet his mother, Beth ([[Sara Allgood]]). His older brothers, Ianto ([[John Loder (actor)|John Loder]]), Ivor ([[Patric Knowles]]), Davy ([[Richard Fraser (actor)|Richard Fraser]]), Gwilym Jr. (Evan S. Evans), and Owen (James Monks) all work in the coal mines with their father, while sister Angharad ([[Maureen O'Hara]]) keeps house with their mother. Huw's childhood is idyllic, the town, not yet overrun with [[Spoil tip|mining spoil]], is beautiful, and the household is warm and loving, the miners sing as they walk home (in this case ''Bread of Heaven'' in [[Welsh language|Welsh]]). The wages are collected, the men wash then eat together. Afterwards the spending money is given out. Huw is smitten on meeting Bronwyn ([[Anna Lee]]), a girl engaged to be married to his eldest brother, Ivor ([[Patric Knowles]]). At the boisterous wedding party Angharad meets the new preacher, Mr. Gruffydd ([[Walter Pidgeon]]), and there is an obvious mutual attraction.\n\nTrouble begins when the mine owner decreases wages, and the miners [[strike action|strike]] in protest. Gwilym's attempt to mediate by not endorsing a strike estranges him from the other miners as well as his older sons, who quit the house. Beth interrupts a late night meeting of the strikers, threatening to kill anyone who harms her husband. While returning home, crossing the fields in a snowstorm in the dark, Beth falls into the river. Huw dives in to save her with the help of the townspeople, and temporarily loses the use of his legs. He recovers with the help of Mr. Gruffydd, which further endears the latter to Angharad.\n\nThe strike is eventually settled, and Gwilym and his sons reconcile, yet many miners have lost their jobs. Angharad is courted by the mine owner's son, Iestyn Evans (Marten Lamont), though she loves Mr. Gruffydd. Mr. Gruffydd loves her too, to the malicious delight of the gossipy townswomen, but cannot bear to subject her to an impoverished churchman's life. Angharad submits to a loveless marriage to Evans, and they relocate out of the country.\n\nHuw begins school at a nearby village. Abused by other boys, he is taught to fight by boxer Dai Bando ([[Rhys Williams (Welsh-American actor)|Rhys Williams]]) and his crony, Cyfartha ([[Barry Fitzgerald]]). After a beating by the cruel teacher Mr. Jonas ([[Morton Lowry]]), Dai Bando avenges Huw with an impromptu boxing display on Mr. Jonas to the delight of his pupils.\n\nOn the day that Bronwyn gives birth to their child, Ivor is killed in a mine accident. Later, two of Morgan's sons are dismissed in favor of less experienced, cheaper laborers. With no job prospects, they leave to seek their fortunes abroad. Huw is awarded a scholarship to university, but to his father's dismay he refuses it to work in the mines. He relocates with Bronwyn, to help provide for her and her child.\n\nWhen Angharad returns without her husband, vicious gossip of an impending divorce spreads through the town. Mr. Gruffydd is denounced by the church [[Deacon#Anglicanism|deacons]], and after condemning the town's small-mindedness, he decides to leave.\n\nJust then, the alarm whistle sounds, signalling another mine disaster. Several men are injured, and Gwilym and others are trapped in a [[cave-in]]. Young Huw, Mr. Gruffydd, and Dai Bando descend with others for a rescue attempt. Gwilym and his son are briefly re-united before he succumbs to his injuries. Huw rides the lift to the surface cradling his father's body, his coal-blackened face devoid of youthful innocence.\n\nNarration by an older Huw recalls, \"Men like my father cannot die.

It was restored in 1808 but finally closed in 1882.   In recent times it came to refer to the group of academic faculties of the [[University of Paris]], as opposed to the professional faculties of law and medicine.<ref>''Dictionniare historique de Paris'', Le Livre de Poche, 2013</ref>   It is also used to refer to the [[Sorbonne|main building]]  of the [[University of Paris]] in the [[5th arrondissement of Paris]], which houses several faculties created when the University was divided up into thirteen autonomous universities in 1970.<ref>''Dictionnaire historique de Paris'', Le Livre de Poche. (2013).</ref>\n\n==Overview==\n[[Robert de Sorbon]] was the son of peasants from the village of [[Sorbon]] in the [[Ardennes (department)|Ardennes]], who had become a master of theology, a canon of the Cathedral of [[Notre Dame de Paris]], and the confessor and chaplain of King [[Louis IX]] (Saint Louis). At the time that he founded his college, the [[University of Paris]] had already been in existence for half a century, and already had thousands of students.  Obtaining a higher degree in theology could take as long as twenty years, and therefore required considerable financial support.  Students who belonged to the religious orders of the Franciscans and Dominicans, or from the large monasteries of Cluny or Citeaux, received housing and board from their religious orders, but independent students did not.  Sorbon founded his college to provide housing and board for poorer students of theology who did not have such support.<ref>''Dictionniare historique de Paris'', Le Livre de Poche, 2013</ref>\n\nSorbon purchased several houses on Rue Coupe-Gueule (now Rue de la Sorbonne) and made them into lodging for students.  The college opened in 1257 with about twenty students, called ''socii''.  As the college grew, Sorbon provided a library containing over a thousand volumes by 1292, the largest in the university, and a chapel.<ref>''Dictionniare historique de Paris'', Le Livre de Poche, 2013</ref> \n  \nThe Sorbonne became the most distinguished theological institution in France, and its doctors were frequently called upon to render opinions on important ecclesiastical and theological issues. In 1470, the Sorbonne had one of the first printing presses in France.<ref>''Dictionnaire historique de Paris'' (2013)</ref>  It was particularly active in the effort to suppress heresy and the spread of [[Protestant]] doctrines.  Its students included [[Cardinal Richelieu]], who studied there from 1606 to 1607.   Richelieu became Proviseur, or administrator of the college on 29 August 1622.  Between 1635 and 1642, Richelieu renovated the Sorbonne;  he consolidated the Sorbonne with two smaller colleges, and built a complex of new buildings, including a domed chapel, around a large courtyard.  Richelieu left a large part of his fortune and his library to the Sorbonne, and he was buried in the chapel.  Only the chapel remains of the Richelieu era buildings.<ref>Sarmant, Thierry, ''Histoire de Paris'' (2012), Editions Jean-Paul Gisserot, Paris. ({{ISBN|978-2-755-8033-03}})</ref>\n\nThe Sorbonne was closed to students in 1791 during the [[French Revolution]]. For a brief time, under [[Robespierre]], the chapel became a Temple of Reason.  [[Napoleon I of France|Napoleon]] turned the college buildings into studios for artists.  In 1822, it became the home of the faculties of letters, sciences and theology of the University of Paris.\nIn 1885,  as part of the Third Republic policy of separation of church and state, the theology faculty was officially closed.  The old buildings of the Sorbonne, with the exception of the chapel, were demolished and the new Sorbonne building, designed by [[Henri Paul N\u00e9not]],  opened in 1889, the centenary of the French Revolution.  It contained a large amphitheater, reception halls and meeting rooms, the offices of the rector of the University of Paris, and the faculties of arts and sciences.  The chapel was no longer used for religious services, but only for official ceremonies and exhibitions.<ref>''Dictionnaire historique de Paris'' (2013)</ref>\n\nIn 1971, as a result of the riots of demonstrations of May 1968, the University of Paris was broken up into thirteen independent faculties.  The New Sorbonne building became the home of the Universities of Paris I, II, III, IV, V, the [[\u00c9cole Nationale des Chartes]], and the [[\u00c9cole pratique des hautes \u00e9tudes]].\n\n==Foundation==\n[[Robert de Sorbon]], a native of [[Le R\u00e9thelois]], was a distinguished professor and famous preacher who lived from 1201 till 1274. Sorbon found that there was a defect in the primitive organization of the University of Paris. The two principal [[mendicant]] orders\u2014the [[Dominican Order|Dominicans]] and the [[Franciscans]]\u2014each had [[college]]s at Paris where they delivered lectures which extern students could attend without fee.\n\nRobert de Sorbon decided that the university should also provide free instruction, so that it could compete with the religious orders. Further, he believed the society of professors should follow the practices of the [[cenobitic]] life, except in vows.  His important work was made possible by the high esteem in which de Sorbon was held at Paris, together with his intellectual brilliance, great generosity, and the assistance of his friends.  The foundation dates from 1257 or the beginning of 1258. [[Guillaume de Saint-Amour]], [[G\u00e9rard d'Abbeville]], [[Henry of Ghent]], [[Guillaume des Grez]], [[Odo or Eudes of Douai]], [[Chr\u00e9tien de Beauvais]], [[G\u00e9rard de Reims]], [[Nicolas de Bar]] were among the most illustrious scholars connected either with the first chairs in the Sorbonne, or with the first association that constituted it.  These [[Expert|savants]] were already attached to the university staff.\n\n==Organization==\nThe constitution of the society as conceived by De Sorbon was simple: an administrator (''provisor''), associates (''socii''), and guests (''hospites''). The provisor was the head; nothing could be done without consulting him; he installed the members selected by the society, and confirmed the statutes drawn up by it; he had to provide for everything.\n\nThe associates formed the body of the society. To be admitted to it, the candidate was required to have taught a course of [[philosophy]]. There were two kinds of associates, the {{lang|fr|bursaires}} and the {{lang|fr|pensionnaires}}. The latter paid forty (Paris) pounds a year; the former were provided for by the house. The [[bursary|burse]] could be granted only to persons not having an income of forty (Paris) pounds. There was a ''[[primus inter pares]]'', the [[prior]], who presided over all internal affairs of the house.\n\n[[Doctorate|Doctor]]s and [[bachelor]]s were alike eligible, but, owing to the number of the latter, the custom rapidly grew up of selecting only bachelors.  Other persons were candidates for admission to the society rather than members of it. From the material and intellectual point of view, they enjoyed the same privileges as the members: board, lodging, books, spiritual and scholastic exercises but they had no votes. When they had fulfilled the condition of teaching philosophy, they were admissible as members. The course of studies lasted ten years, during which time their burses continued; but if, at the end of ten years, they had not given proof of their ability, either as teachers or as preachers, they had to give up their burse.\n\n==History==\nThe ordinary lectures were public, and consequently were attended by students who belonged to neither of the divisions of the society. The doctors and bachelors were authorized to give shelter to other poor pupils. Besides the work of the classroom, there was the duty of preaching or labouring in the parishes. In preparation for this, the associates, on certain days, had to deliver sermons or conferences (''collationes'') to the community. The purely spiritual side was not forgotten.  Conferences, usually delivered by the prior, on this important part of the Christian and priestly life were given especially to the interns.\n\nFor twenty years the ability of the administrator, or provisor, corresponded to the foreseeing devotedness of the founder. This stretch of time showed the effectiveness of the administrative measures which De Sorbon had adopted.  He had written down the rules in thirty-eight articles.  This rule was directed towards the maintenance of common life, from silence in the refectory, to simplicity of authorized dress. As circumstances permitted, about 1271 De Sorbon added a literary college: this was the [[Coll\u00e8ge de Calvi]] or the \"little Sorbonne\".\n\nThe constitution which Robert de Sorbon gave to his college lasted for centuries. If Claude H\u00e9m\u00e9r\u00e9 (1574\u20131650, librarian of the Sorbonne) saw in the project the conception of a powerful intellect, \"Hoc primus in lycaeo Parisiensi vidit Robertus\", its realization became a model college for others.  The expression ''Pauvres ma\u00eetres et \u00e9tudiants en th\u00e9ologie'' seems to emphasize the two primary characteristics of the society: equality in poverty, an equality so perfect between masters and pupils that it designated them by a common name; the poverty of the pupils, since most of them were bursaires; the poverty of the masters, since, content with what was strictly necessary, they renounced all other professional remuneration. This equality was always maintained with scrupulous care; the Sorbon repeated as an axiom, ''Omnes nos sumus socii et aequales'', and referred to the college as ''pauperem nostram Sorbonem''.\n\nFrom the outset the college enjoyed the favour of the Holy See. [[Pope Alexander IV]] (1259) urged the French [[bishop]]s to support it, [[Urban IV]] (1262) recommended it to the goodwill of the whole Christian world, and [[Clement IV]] (1268) granted it papal approbation.  Wealthy benefactors provided it with ample endowment. A high standard of scholarship was maintained and the severity of the ''actus Sorbonnicus'', or examination for degrees, including the defence of the \"thesis Robertina\", became proverbial. The professorial corps was highly respected.  From all parts of Europe, theological and political questions were sent to it for solution.\n\nIn 1470 the Sorbonne introduced the art of printing into France by calling to Paris three of [[Johannes Gutenberg|Gutenberg]]'s associates, [[Gering (printer)|Gering]], [[Friburger]], and [[Crantz (printer)|Crantz]].  Among its principal patrons and benefactors was [[Cardinal Richelieu]], who held for a time the office of provisor and who, in 1635, laid the cornerstone of an edifice to be built at his expense for the use of the college. He was buried in the [[church of the Sorbonne]], where his tomb is still preserved.\n\nThe doctors of the college were loyal defenders of the Catholic faith against the inroads of [[Protestantism]] and [[the Enlightenment]].  As other teachers of theology in the university became members of the Sorbonne, by the beginning of the sixteenth century, its staff was practically identical with the university faculty.  De Sorbon had created a library.  It expanded rapidly, due to numerous gifts.\n\nOn the other hand, the professors gave their support to [[Gallicanism]] and obliged their members to subscribe to the \"four articles\".  This attitude naturally weakened the prestige of the Sorbonne as a theological school.  Ecclesiastical students had to seek their education in the seminaries. The Sorbonne itself was suppressed by decree of 5 April 1792, after the French Revolution.\n\nNapoleon restored it in 1808 as the theological faculty of the newly organized university. It did not, however, regain its former standing or influence, though it continued in existence until 1882, when it was finally suppressed. In 1884 the construction of the present building was begun and it was completed in 1889.

It was restored in 1808 but finally closed in 1882.

(2013).</ref>\n\n==Overview==\n[[Robert de Sorbon]] was the son of peasants from the village of [[Sorbon]] in the [[Ardennes (department)|Ardennes]], who had become a master of theology, a canon of the Cathedral of [[Notre Dame de Paris]], and the confessor and chaplain of King [[Louis IX]] (Saint Louis). At the time that he founded his college, the [[University of Paris]] had already been in existence for half a century, and already had thousands of students.  Obtaining a higher degree in theology could take as long as twenty years, and therefore required considerable financial support.  Students who belonged to the religious orders of the Franciscans and Dominicans, or from the large monasteries of Cluny or Citeaux, received housing and board from their religious orders, but independent students did not.  Sorbon founded his college to provide housing and board for poorer students of theology who did not have such support.<ref>''Dictionniare historique de Paris'', Le Livre de Poche, 2013</ref>\n\nSorbon purchased several houses on Rue Coupe-Gueule (now Rue de la Sorbonne) and made them into lodging for students.  The college opened in 1257 with about twenty students, called ''socii''.  As the college grew, Sorbon provided a library containing over a thousand volumes by 1292, the largest in the university, and a chapel.<ref>''Dictionniare historique de Paris'', Le Livre de Poche, 2013</ref> \n  \nThe Sorbonne became the most distinguished theological institution in France, and its doctors were frequently called upon to render opinions on important ecclesiastical and theological issues. In 1470, the Sorbonne had one of the first printing presses in France.<ref>''Dictionnaire historique de Paris'' (2013)</ref>  It was particularly active in the effort to suppress heresy and the spread of [[Protestant]] doctrines.  Its students included [[Cardinal Richelieu]], who studied there from 1606 to 1607.   Richelieu became Proviseur, or administrator of the college on 29 August 1622.  Between 1635 and 1642, Richelieu renovated the Sorbonne;  he consolidated the Sorbonne with two smaller colleges, and built a complex of new buildings, including a domed chapel, around a large courtyard.  Richelieu left a large part of his fortune and his library to the Sorbonne, and he was buried in the chapel.  Only the chapel remains of the Richelieu era buildings.<ref>Sarmant, Thierry, ''Histoire de Paris'' (2012), Editions Jean-Paul Gisserot, Paris. ({{ISBN|978-2-755-8033-03}})</ref>\n\nThe Sorbonne was closed to students in 1791 during the [[French Revolution]]. For a brief time, under [[Robespierre]], the chapel became a Temple of Reason.  [[Napoleon I of France|Napoleon]] turned the college buildings into studios for artists.  In 1822, it became the home of the faculties of letters, sciences and theology of the University of Paris.\nIn 1885,  as part of the Third Republic policy of separation of church and state, the theology faculty was officially closed.  The old buildings of the Sorbonne, with the exception of the chapel, were demolished and the new Sorbonne building, designed by [[Henri Paul N\u00e9not]],  opened in 1889, the centenary of the French Revolution.  It contained a large amphitheater, reception halls and meeting rooms, the offices of the rector of the University of Paris, and the faculties of arts and sciences.  The chapel was no longer used for religious services, but only for official ceremonies and exhibitions.<ref>''Dictionnaire historique de Paris'' (2013)</ref>\n\nIn 1971, as a result of the riots of demonstrations of May 1968, the University of Paris was broken up into thirteen independent faculties.  The New Sorbonne building became the home of the Universities of Paris I, II, III, IV, V, the [[\u00c9cole Nationale des Chartes]], and the [[\u00c9cole pratique des hautes \u00e9tudes]].\n\n==Foundation==\n[[Robert de Sorbon]], a native of [[Le R\u00e9thelois]], was a distinguished professor and famous preacher who lived from 1201 till 1274. Sorbon found that there was a defect in the primitive organization of the University of Paris. The two principal [[mendicant]] orders\u2014the [[Dominican Order|Dominicans]] and the [[Franciscans]]\u2014each had [[college]]s at Paris where they delivered lectures which extern students could attend without fee.\n\nRobert de Sorbon decided that the university should also provide free instruction, so that it could compete with the religious orders. Further, he believed the society of professors should follow the practices of the [[cenobitic]] life, except in vows.  His important work was made possible by the high esteem in which de Sorbon was held at Paris, together with his intellectual brilliance, great generosity, and the assistance of his friends.  The foundation dates from 1257 or the beginning of 1258. [[Guillaume de Saint-Amour]], [[G\u00e9rard d'Abbeville]], [[Henry of Ghent]], [[Guillaume des Grez]], [[Odo or Eudes of Douai]], [[Chr\u00e9tien de Beauvais]], [[G\u00e9rard de Reims]], [[Nicolas de Bar]] were among the most illustrious scholars connected either with the first chairs in the Sorbonne, or with the first association that constituted it.  These [[Expert|savants]] were already attached to the university staff.\n\n==Organization==\nThe constitution of the society as conceived by De Sorbon was simple: an administrator (''provisor''), associates (''socii''), and guests (''hospites''). The provisor was the head; nothing could be done without consulting him; he installed the members selected by the society, and confirmed the statutes drawn up by it; he had to provide for everything.\n\nThe associates formed the body of the society. To be admitted to it, the candidate was required to have taught a course of [[philosophy]]. There were two kinds of associates, the {{lang|fr|bursaires}} and the {{lang|fr|pensionnaires}}. The latter paid forty (Paris) pounds a year; the former were provided for by the house. The [[bursary|burse]] could be granted only to persons not having an income of forty (Paris) pounds. There was a ''[[primus inter pares]]'', the [[prior]], who presided over all internal affairs of the house.\n\n[[Doctorate|Doctor]]s and [[bachelor]]s were alike eligible, but, owing to the number of the latter, the custom rapidly grew up of selecting only bachelors.  Other persons were candidates for admission to the society rather than members of it. From the material and intellectual point of view, they enjoyed the same privileges as the members: board, lodging, books, spiritual and scholastic exercises but they had no votes. When they had fulfilled the condition of teaching philosophy, they were admissible as members. The course of studies lasted ten years, during which time their burses continued; but if, at the end of ten years, they had not given proof of their ability, either as teachers or as preachers, they had to give up their burse.\n\n==History==\nThe ordinary lectures were public, and consequently were attended by students who belonged to neither of the divisions of the society. The doctors and bachelors were authorized to give shelter to other poor pupils. Besides the work of the classroom, there was the duty of preaching or labouring in the parishes. In preparation for this, the associates, on certain days, had to deliver sermons or conferences (''collationes'') to the community. The purely spiritual side was not forgotten.  Conferences, usually delivered by the prior, on this important part of the Christian and priestly life were given especially to the interns.\n\nFor twenty years the ability of the administrator, or provisor, corresponded to the foreseeing devotedness of the founder. This stretch of time showed the effectiveness of the administrative measures which De Sorbon had adopted.  He had written down the rules in thirty-eight articles.  This rule was directed towards the maintenance of common life, from silence in the refectory, to simplicity of authorized dress. As circumstances permitted, about 1271 De Sorbon added a literary college: this was the [[Coll\u00e8ge de Calvi]] or the \"little Sorbonne\".\n\nThe constitution which Robert de Sorbon gave to his college lasted for centuries. If Claude H\u00e9m\u00e9r\u00e9 (1574\u20131650, librarian of the Sorbonne) saw in the project the conception of a powerful intellect, \"Hoc primus in lycaeo Parisiensi vidit Robertus\", its realization became a model college for others.  The expression ''Pauvres ma\u00eetres et \u00e9tudiants en th\u00e9ologie'' seems to emphasize the two primary characteristics of the society: equality in poverty, an equality so perfect between masters and pupils that it designated them by a common name; the poverty of the pupils, since most of them were bursaires; the poverty of the masters, since, content with what was strictly necessary, they renounced all other professional remuneration. This equality was always maintained with scrupulous care; the Sorbon repeated as an axiom, ''Omnes nos sumus socii et aequales'', and referred to the college as ''pauperem nostram Sorbonem''.\n\nFrom the outset the college enjoyed the favour of the Holy See. [[Pope Alexander IV]] (1259) urged the French [[bishop]]s to support it, [[Urban IV]] (1262) recommended it to the goodwill of the whole Christian world, and [[Clement IV]] (1268) granted it papal approbation.  Wealthy benefactors provided it with ample endowment. A high standard of scholarship was maintained and the severity of the ''actus Sorbonnicus'', or examination for degrees, including the defence of the \"thesis Robertina\", became proverbial. The professorial corps was highly respected.  From all parts of Europe, theological and political questions were sent to it for solution.\n\nIn 1470 the Sorbonne introduced the art of printing into France by calling to Paris three of [[Johannes Gutenberg|Gutenberg]]'s associates, [[Gering (printer)|Gering]], [[Friburger]], and [[Crantz (printer)|Crantz]].  Among its principal patrons and benefactors was [[Cardinal Richelieu]], who held for a time the office of provisor and who, in 1635, laid the cornerstone of an edifice to be built at his expense for the use of the college. He was buried in the [[church of the Sorbonne]], where his tomb is still preserved.\n\nThe doctors of the college were loyal defenders of the Catholic faith against the inroads of [[Protestantism]] and [[the Enlightenment]].  As other teachers of theology in the university became members of the Sorbonne, by the beginning of the sixteenth century, its staff was practically identical with the university faculty.  De Sorbon had created a library.  It expanded rapidly, due to numerous gifts.\n\nOn the other hand, the professors gave their support to [[Gallicanism]] and obliged their members to subscribe to the \"four articles\".  This attitude naturally weakened the prestige of the Sorbonne as a theological school.  Ecclesiastical students had to seek their education in the seminaries. The Sorbonne itself was suppressed by decree of 5 April 1792, after the French Revolution.\n\nNapoleon restored it in 1808 as the theological faculty of the newly organized university. It did not, however, regain its former standing or influence, though it continued in existence until 1882, when it was finally suppressed. In 1884 the construction of the present building was begun and it was completed in 1889. At the beginning of the 20th century, it was occupied by the various departments of [[literature|letters]] and [[science]] which formed the [[\u00c9cole des Hautes Etudes]].\n\n==Accomplished students==\n*[[Antoine Arnauld]]\n*[[Hardouin de Beaumont de P\u00e9r\u00e9fixe]], Bishop of Rodez\n*[[Pope Clement VI]]\n*[[Jean-Baptiste Dubos]], historian and critic, Perpetual Secretary of the [[Acad\u00e9mie fran\u00e7aise]]\n*[[Andr\u00e9 Duval]], Dean of the Paris School of Catholic Theology\n*[[Philippe de Gamaches]], theologian, first Chair of Theology at the Sorbonne\n*[[J\u00e9r\u00f4me-Claude Gandolphe]], delegate to the National Constituent Assembly\n*[[Charles Gobinet]], religious writer and teacher, early principal of the [[Coll\u00e8ge du Plessis]]\n*[[Jean Gobinet]], theologian, early principal of the [[coll\u00e8ge du Plessis]]\n*[[Joseph Hook]]\n*[[Jacques Lescot]], Bishop of Chartres, principal of the [[Coll\u00e8ge de Dainville]]\n*[[Gabriel de Nail]], Great bard of Amiens\n*[[Louis-Antoine, Cardinal de Noailles|Louis-Antoine de Noailles]], Archbishop of Paris\n*[[Jean-Jacques Olier]], founder of the [[Society of Saint-Sulpice]]\n*[[Nicole Oresme]], Old master of the [[Coll\u00e8ge de Navarre]]\n*[[Cardinal Richelieu|Armand Jean du Plessis de Richelieu]], Cardinal de Richelieu and chief minister to Louis XIII\n*[[Edmond Richer]]\n*[[Pierre Sigorgne]], High vicar of the Diocese of Macon, correspondent for the Institute\n*[[Pierre-Fran\u00e7ois Tinthoin]]\n*[[Madame Wei Tao-Ming]] (Chen Yu-Hsiu)\n*[[Thomas of Ireland]], author of the popular florilegium ''Manipulus florum''.<ref>Chris L.

His artwork appeared on nine different magazine covers from 1923 to 1932. Martin designed the then-world's largest ever electrical display in 1917. He reshaped the then-iconic Fisk Tire Boy in late 1929. He played in [[tennis]] tournaments around the [[New York metropolitan area|Greater New York area]] from 1909 to 1931.

Path: R. Atkinson Fox Society's homepage>Links>See More. Its key source was ''[[The Artist's Magazine|American Artist]]'' magazine (1937-2012), June 2006.</ref> Major advancements in printing techniques were then taking place. This included breakthroughs in the [[halftone]] process. It made the printing of images for commercial usage more economical, feasible, and realistic. The reproduction of art from [[wood engraving]]s (time consuming and strenuous), was largely replaced with [[photoengraving|photo-mechanical engravings]] (higher accuracy level).<ref>''Scribner's Magazine''. \"American Illustration and the Reproductive  Arts\" by Carrington, July 1922 pp. 123-28. (Viewable online at www.unz.com.)</ref> These and other methods were utilized by artist, writer, teacher, innovator\u2013[[Howard Pyle]], who is generally regarded as \"The Father of American Illustration.\"<ref>''The New York Times'', Nov. 10, 1911 p. 11. Obit column. Excerpt: \"He was almost [or like] the father of American magazine illustration, as it is known to-day.\"</ref> Others who gained fame in this field included [[Howard Chandler Christy]], [[Harrison Fisher]], [[James Montgomery Flagg]], [[Charles Dana Gibson]], [[John Held Jr.]], [[J. C. Leyendecker]], [[Maxfield Parrish]], [[Coles Phillips]], [[Frederic Remington]], [[Norman Rockwell]], [[Jessie Willcox Smith]] and [[N. C. Wyeth]].\n\nHowever, the vast majority of illustrators received little recognition, compared to the [[fine art]]ists. This was basically due to their artwork being viewed as more commercially, than creatively inspired. Nonetheless, these unheralded illustrators played a powerful role, in communicating the people's aspirations, concerns, customs, humor, labor, morals and social interests.<ref name=\"historical\">''Cover Story: The Art of American Magazine Covers 1900-1950'' by Heller & Fili, 1996.</ref> One of them was Paul Martin, whose work appeared on the covers of ''[[Collier's]]'', ''[[Everybody's Magazine|Everybody's]]'', ''[[Farm & Fireside]]'', ''[[The Farmer's Wife (women's magazine)|The Farmer's Wife]]'', ''[[Liberty (general interest magazine)|Liberty]]'', ''[[Parents (magazine)|Parents]]'' and ''[[People's Home Journal]]'' from 1923-31. These seven magazines were once ranked among the most widely circulated. They all went out of business long ago, except for ''[[Parents (magazine)|Parents]]''. Their eventual downfall was caused by the changing times (or taste), emergence of radio and television (more attractive medium for advertisers), and economics (increased cost / decreased revenue). The more specialized ones that targeted specific audiences, tended to fare better. Another point is that major advancements in photographic equipment and technology took place during the 1930s. This brought about the gradual changeover (twenty-five+ year process) from illustrated to photographic covers.<ref name=\"historical\"/> The former still lingered on, for its innovative and enchanting qualities, until succumbing to digital media (especially [[Adobe Photoshop|Photoshop]]).\n\n==Collier's==\n[[File:Collier's10-25-24.jpg|thumb|117px|(Calling the play) ''Collier's'' 10-25-1924]]\nGeneral interest magazines (mixture of entertainment, pictures, politics, serials, short stories and sports) were once very popular and appealed to diverse audiences. One of them was the historically significant ''[[Collier's]]'' (founded 1888), which had a revival under new editor [[Collier's#Editors|William L. Chenery]] in 1925.<ref name=\"Collier's\">''A Cavalcade of Collier's'', edited by McArdle (''Collier's'' last editor), 1959 pp. xii-xiii.</ref><ref>''Magazines in the Twentieth Century'', Peterson, 1956 p. 188; ''The New York Times'', August 20, 1974 p. 38.</ref> Martin drew many of its covers during the mid-[[Roaring Twenties]], including seven in 1925 (twenty 1923\u201327). Some artists created a niche and then stuck with it, such as in drawing comical situations, domestic follies, political satire, pretty women or simple pleasures. His recurring theme was of a youthful boy engaged in various lighthearted activities. This included the following:<ref>These seventeen described activities, each appeared on a ''Collier's'' cover between Feb. 2, 1924 and Aug. 27, 1927.

There was a nostalgic sentiment to them. Martin excluded the non-essential details (extra people, structures, trees, scenery etc.), which allowed viewers to make an instant connection. His paintings were often easy to recognize, since their theme and style remained fairly consistent. They sometimes gave the illusion of three-dimensional depth. This was through the use of various techniques, such as overlapping, color intensity or variation and [[perspective (graphical)|linear perspective]]. His cover art never corresponded to anything in particular, but rather had a holiday or seasonal theme or portrayed the magazine's overall image (common practice back then).<ref>''Collier's'' usually preferred cover art that conveyed plain and simple thoughts, unlike its main rival in the ''Post''.</ref> Martin mostly hired local boys for the [[photo shoot|photo sessions]].<ref name=\"hard\">''Hard Row to Hoe'' (literary newsletter), V-9 Fall 2005. \"Golden Era of the Illustrations\" pp. 1-3.

[and] entered a huge bright room ... This was my uncle's studio. ... Although my uncle generally used local models, especially boys, some of our family posed for photographs which would later miraculously turn into paintings. My grandmother was depicted in a Thanksgiving scene basting a turkey ... My brother and I sat for ''The Bookshelf for Boys and Girls'' while Uncle Paul took our picture, as we sat on the kitchen table of our own house.

''[[Collier's]]'' couldn't keep up with the rapidly changing times following [[World War II|WWII]], and ceased publication in December 1956.<ref name=\"Collier's\"/> The main culprit was television, which dramatically affected its advertising and circulation revenue.

The [[United States Tennis Association|USLTA]] adopted the player-writer rule on Feb. 2, 1924. It stated that any active player who received payment for writing on tennis, would be stripped of their amateur status starting Jan. 1, 1925. This resolution was easily approved by its members, who voted in blocks (47,196 to 6,250). It would have most deeply affected Bill Tilden, followed distantly by Vincent Richards. Strong opposition came from the influential [[Stephen Wallis Merrihew|S. Wallis Merrihew]], fans and writers.  A petition was signed by, among others, 12 [not 18] of the top 25 ranked racketmen from the [[New York metropolitan area|NY Metro Area]]. It rebuked the new rule that redefined amateurism. [[Walter Merrill Hall]] (#11) and Martin (#18) did not sign on with the pro-Tilden forces. They instead wrote a separate letter (full text printed, p. 2D), urging its reconsideration. A special committee of seven was formed, to further study the troubling matter on Nov. 2, 1924. (This was after a months-long selection process, to fill the final three critical spots.) It consisted of Arthur Hellen, Merrihew, Jones Mersereau, [[Devereux Milburn]], Senator [[George W. Pepper|George Pepper]], [[Grantland Rice]] and Tilden. Their report was released on Dec. 13. The USLTA accepted its recommendations, to greatly modify the anti-writing resolution. The alternative was to face continued backlash.</ref>).

A first-hand account by ''New York Times'' sportswriter, [[Allison Danzig]]. Excerpts: \"This afternoon [[Bill Tilden|[Bill] Tilden]] and Strachan advanced from the semi-finals of the doubles, by putting out Alfred D. Hammett and Paul Martin at 6-4, 5-7, 6-1, 6-3. ... It required some of the best tennis that Tilden has played here all week, before the Philadelphians were able to overcome the New York pair. Hammett and Martin were always contenders, except in the third set when they slumped badly; and in order to hold them off, Tilden constantly found it necessary to invade his partner's territory and play the opposing pair single-handed. ... There was nothing to choose between the two teams in the first and second sets. In the third set, Hammett and Martin went to pieces as Tilden became rampant and raked their court with placement drives and volleys. After the Phlladelphians had gained a commanding lead [in that one], the New York pair allowed the set to go without making much effort, preferring to save their strength for the next chapter. But after the rest period, Tilden returned to the courts to play perhaps his best tennis of the match. Both Martin and Hammett fought with everything they had and their team work was splendidly coordinated, but all counted for nought against the individual brilliance of Tilden\" [then ranked [[World number 1 ranked male tennis players|World No. 1]]].<ref name=\"Tilden\"/><ref>''The New York Times'', Sept. 30, 1921 p. 12.

Its key source was ''[[The Artist's Magazine|American Artist]]'' magazine (1937-2012), June 2006.</ref> Major advancements in printing techniques were then taking place. This included breakthroughs in the [[halftone]] process. It made the printing of images for commercial usage more economical, feasible, and realistic. The reproduction of art from [[wood engraving]]s (time consuming and strenuous), was largely replaced with [[photoengraving|photo-mechanical engravings]] (higher accuracy level).<ref>''Scribner's Magazine''. \"American Illustration and the Reproductive  Arts\" by Carrington, July 1922 pp. 123-28. (Viewable online at www.unz.com.)</ref> These and other methods were utilized by artist, writer, teacher, innovator\u2013[[Howard Pyle]], who is generally regarded as \"The Father of American Illustration.\"<ref>''The New York Times'', Nov. 10, 1911 p. 11.

Excerpt: \"He was almost [or like] the father of American magazine illustration, as it is known to-day.\"</ref> Others who gained fame in this field included [[Howard Chandler Christy]], [[Harrison Fisher]], [[James Montgomery Flagg]], [[Charles Dana Gibson]], [[John Held Jr.]], [[J. C. Leyendecker]], [[Maxfield Parrish]], [[Coles Phillips]], [[Frederic Remington]], [[Norman Rockwell]], [[Jessie Willcox Smith]] and [[N. C. Wyeth]].\n\nHowever, the vast majority of illustrators received little recognition, compared to the [[fine art]]ists. This was basically due to their artwork being viewed as more commercially, than creatively inspired. Nonetheless, these unheralded illustrators played a powerful role, in communicating the people's aspirations, concerns, customs, humor, labor, morals and social interests.<ref name=\"historical\">''Cover Story: The Art of American Magazine Covers 1900-1950'' by Heller & Fili, 1996.</ref> One of them was Paul Martin, whose work appeared on the covers of ''[[Collier's]]'', ''[[Everybody's Magazine|Everybody's]]'', ''[[Farm & Fireside]]'', ''[[The Farmer's Wife (women's magazine)|The Farmer's Wife]]'', ''[[Liberty (general interest magazine)|Liberty]]'', ''[[Parents (magazine)|Parents]]'' and ''[[People's Home Journal]]'' from 1923-31. These seven magazines were once ranked among the most widely circulated. They all went out of business long ago, except for ''[[Parents (magazine)|Parents]]''. Their eventual downfall was caused by the changing times (or taste), emergence of radio and television (more attractive medium for advertisers), and economics (increased cost / decreased revenue). The more specialized ones that targeted specific audiences, tended to fare better. Another point is that major advancements in photographic equipment and technology took place during the 1930s. This brought about the gradual changeover (twenty-five+ year process) from illustrated to photographic covers.<ref name=\"historical\"/> The former still lingered on, for its innovative and enchanting qualities, until succumbing to digital media (especially [[Adobe Photoshop|Photoshop]]).\n\n==Collier's==\n[[File:Collier's10-25-24.jpg|thumb|117px|(Calling the play) ''Collier's'' 10-25-1924]]\nGeneral interest magazines (mixture of entertainment, pictures, politics, serials, short stories and sports) were once very popular and appealed to diverse audiences. One of them was the historically significant ''[[Collier's]]'' (founded 1888), which had a revival under new editor [[Collier's#Editors|William L.

Some artists created a niche and then stuck with it, such as in drawing comical situations, domestic follies, political satire, pretty women or simple pleasures.

There was a nostalgic sentiment to them. Martin excluded the non-essential details (extra people, structures, trees, scenery etc.), which allowed viewers to make an instant connection. His paintings were often easy to recognize, since their theme and style remained fairly consistent. They sometimes gave the illusion of three-dimensional depth. This was through the use of various techniques, such as overlapping, color intensity or variation and [[perspective (graphical)|linear perspective]]. His cover art never corresponded to anything in particular, but rather had a holiday or seasonal theme or portrayed the magazine's overall image (common practice back then).<ref>''Collier's'' usually preferred cover art that conveyed plain and simple thoughts, unlike its main rival in the ''Post''.</ref> Martin mostly hired local boys for the [[photo shoot|photo sessions]].<ref name=\"hard\">''Hard Row to Hoe'' (literary newsletter), V-9 Fall 2005. \"Golden Era of the Illustrations\" pp. 1-3.

The [[United States Tennis Association|USLTA]] adopted the player-writer rule on Feb. 2, 1924. It stated that any active player who received payment for writing on tennis, would be stripped of their amateur status starting Jan. 1, 1925. This resolution was easily approved by its members, who voted in blocks (47,196 to 6,250). It would have most deeply affected Bill Tilden, followed distantly by Vincent Richards. Strong opposition came from the influential [[Stephen Wallis Merrihew|S. Wallis Merrihew]], fans and writers.  A petition was signed by, among others, 12 [not 18] of the top 25 ranked racketmen from the [[New York metropolitan area|NY Metro Area]]. It rebuked the new rule that redefined amateurism. [[Walter Merrill Hall]] (#11) and Martin (#18) did not sign on with the pro-Tilden forces. They instead wrote a separate letter (full text printed, p. 2D), urging its reconsideration. A special committee of seven was formed, to further study the troubling matter on Nov. 2, 1924. (This was after a months-long selection process, to fill the final three critical spots.) It consisted of Arthur Hellen, Merrihew, Jones Mersereau, [[Devereux Milburn]], Senator [[George W. Pepper|George Pepper]], [[Grantland Rice]] and Tilden. Their report was released on Dec. 13. The USLTA accepted its recommendations, to greatly modify the anti-writing resolution. The alternative was to face continued backlash.</ref>).

A first-hand account by ''New York Times'' sportswriter, [[Allison Danzig]]. Excerpts: \"This afternoon [[Bill Tilden|[Bill] Tilden]] and Strachan advanced from the semi-finals of the doubles, by putting out Alfred D. Hammett and Paul Martin at 6-4, 5-7, 6-1, 6-3. ... It required some of the best tennis that Tilden has played here all week, before the Philadelphians were able to overcome the New York pair. Hammett and Martin were always contenders, except in the third set when they slumped badly; and in order to hold them off, Tilden constantly found it necessary to invade his partner's territory and play the opposing pair single-handed. ... There was nothing to choose between the two teams in the first and second sets. In the third set, Hammett and Martin went to pieces as Tilden became rampant and raked their court with placement drives and volleys. After the Phlladelphians had gained a commanding lead [in that one], the New York pair allowed the set to go without making much effort, preferring to save their strength for the next chapter. But after the rest period, Tilden returned to the courts to play perhaps his best tennis of the match. Both Martin and Hammett fought with everything they had and their team work was splendidly coordinated, but all counted for nought against the individual brilliance of Tilden\" [then ranked [[World number 1 ranked male tennis players|World No. 1]]].<ref name=\"Tilden\"/><ref>''The New York Times'', Sept. 30, 1921 p. 12.

The title of the album was lifted from the [[The Raw and the Cooked|book of the same name]] (\"Le Cru et le Cuit\" in French) by French anthropologist [[Claude L\u00e9vi-Strauss]]. Four songs from the album first appeared in film soundtracks in the mid-1980s, three of which were [[soul music|soul]] tracks from the ''[[Tin Men]]'' film.

The title of the album was lifted from the [[The Raw and the Cooked|book of the same name]] (\"Le Cru et le Cuit\" in French) by French anthropologist [[Claude L\u00e9vi-Strauss]]. Four songs from the album first appeared in film soundtracks in the mid-1980s, three of which were [[soul music|soul]] tracks from the ''[[Tin Men]]'' film. The band had already recorded over half of the album by the time [[David Z (music producer)|David Z]] came to produce the remainder. His work with the band, which resulted in [[dance-rock]] material, included studio experimentation.\n\nThe album is considered to be an eclectic, varied album, taking influences from numerous genres including [[Motown]] soul, [[rock music|rock]], [[funk]], [[British beat]] and [[pop music|pop]]. Released in 1988\u201389 on [[I.R.S. Records]], ''The Raw & the Cooked'' was a major commercial success, selling over three million copies. Numerous singles were released from the album, including the two US number one singles \"[[She Drives Me Crazy]]\" and \"[[Good Thing (Fine Young Cannibals song)|Good Thing]]\". The album was also critically acclaimed and Jo-Ann Greene of [[AllMusic]] called the album a masterpiece and one of the 1980s' most exciting albums. A [[remix]]ed version of the album entitled ''[[The Raw & the Remix]]'' was released in 1990.\n\n== Background and recording ==\n[[File:Fine Young Cannibals.JPG|thumb|left|Fine Young Cannibals in 1990.]]\nMultiple songs from ''The Raw & the Cooked'' debuted long before their release on the album; the band's cover of [[Buzzcocks]]' \"[[Ever Fallen in Love (With Someone You Shouldn't've)]]\" originally appeared on the soundtrack for the 1986 Jonathan Demme film ''[[Something Wild (1986 film)|Something Wild]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/something-wild-mw0000191903|title=Something Wild \u2013 Original Soundtrack \u2013 Songs, Reviews, Credits \u2013 AllMusic|work=allmusic.com|accessdate=14 February 2017}}</ref> Three other songs from the album\u2014\"[[Good Thing (Fine Young Cannibals song)|Good Thing]]\", \"Tell Me What\" and \"As Hard As It Is\"\u2014first appeared in the 1987 film ''[[Tin Men]]'', where the Fine Young Cannibals portrayed a band in a nightclub.<ref>[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0094155/soundtrack IMDB: Tin Men (1987) Soundtrack]</ref> These three songs have a retro-soul style consistent with the film's 1963 [[Baltimore]] setting.<ref name=autogenerated3>{{cite web|last1=Gerard|first1=Chris|title=Classic album revisited: Fine Young Cannibals \"The Raw and The Cooked\"|url=http://www.metroweekly.com/2014/02/classic-album-revisited-fine-y/|website=Metro Weekly|accessdate=7 November 2016|date=11 February 2014}}</ref> At this point, the band were beginning to move away from their \"Sixties [[soul music|soul]] sound\", but ''Tin Men'' director [[Barry Levinson]] persuaded the band to retain the sound on the songs.<ref name=autogenerated11>{{cite web|last1=Tannenbaum|first1=Rob|title=Chewing the Fat With Fine Young Cannibals|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/features/chewing-the-fat-with-fine-young-cannibals-19890420|website=Rolling Stone|accessdate=7 November 2016|date=20 April 1989}}</ref> With these songs, the band had already written and recorded enough songs for one half of the album between their contributions to the two films.<ref name=autogenerated11 />\n\nWhile the band were slowly recording the album, they had spent the period so far focusing on side-projects as a result of an unofficial semi-hiatus following their [[Fine Young Cannibals (album)|1985 debut album]].

The band initially considered [[Latin Rascals]] and [[Gil Evans]] but eventually asked MCA to approach [[Prince (musician)|Prince]] to produce tracks to complete the album. As Prince was unavailable, the label countered with producer [[David Z (music producer)|David Z]], who had worked with Prince and is the older brother of [[Bobby Z.]] of [[The Revolution (band)|The Revolution]].

The whole thing was limited slightly and then sent to a track on a roll of [[Ampex]] 456 running on a [[Studer]] A800 at 15 ips. Only a slight amount of reverb was added to the track later on. The sonic result was closer to a hollow wood block sound than any snare found on a conventional rock record, and in becoming, along with Gift's vocals, the signature of the song, it would go on to have many lives of its own subsequent to the single's run up the charts.<ref name=autogenerated9 />}}\n\nAlso given complex treatment on the track were the \"[[staccato]] single-note lines\" of the guitars, which \"were actually layered six deep, with a few chords thrown in here and there.

Records released a [[remix album]] entitled ''[[The Raw & the Remix]]'' in December 1990. The album, largely consisting of remixes from ''The Raw & the Cooked'', included \"two versions each of 'She Drives Me Crazy,' 'I'm Not the Man I Used to Be' and 'I'm Not Satisfied' as well as danceable overhauls of 'Good Thing,' 'Johnny Come Home' and others.\"<ref name=autogenerated2 /> The album was said to contain \"significant variations\" upon the original songs, including numerous \"major stylistic adjustments\" such as [[dub music|dub]] dissections and the [[Soul II Soul]] remix of \"I'm Not the Man I Used to Be.\"<ref name=autogenerated2 /> The album only reached number 61 on the UK Albums Chart.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.officialcharts.com/artist/22584/fine-young-cannibals/|title=FINE YOUNG CANNIBALS \u2013 full Official Chart History \u2013 Official Charts Company|work=officialcharts.com|accessdate=14 February 2017}}</ref>\n\nThe band's record label and manager had never previously experienced success the size of ''The Raw & the Cooked'', and \"they didn't know how to handle it.\"<ref name=autogenerated21>{{cite web|last1=Chalmers|first1=Graham|title=Interview: Roland Gift brings Fine Young Cannibals hits to Grassington|url=http://www.northyorkshirenews.com/whats-on/music/interview-roland-gift-brings-fine-young-cannibals-hits-to-grassington-1-7295017|accessdate=10 November 2016}}</ref> In the words of Gift, \"they kept saying to us our next record had to be even bigger which was really stupid. That was one of the main things that killed it for me.\"<ref name=autogenerated21 /> As such, the band never recorded a follow up album, and after a hiatus that began in 1992, their first and only song recorded and released after the album was \"The Flame\" for their 1996 compilation album ''[[The Finest (Fine Young Cannibals album)|The Finest]]'', and they subsequently disbanded.<ref name=autogenerated21 /> Gift said \"We just stopped wanting to do it. You might wake up one day and think 'I'm out' but you don't realise it's been at the back of your mind for a while. It was hard to stick to how we appraised the band originally, which was to make great music.\"<ref name=autogenerated21 />\n\nThe innovative snare drum sound from \"She Drives Me Crazy\" quickly became heavily sampled among numerous different recordings as well as a popular television advertisement for [[Pepsi]] in the early 1990s.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.allmusic.com/song/she-drives-me-crazy-mt0040133171|title=She Drives Me Crazy \u2013 Fine Young Cannibals \u2013 Song Info \u2013 AllMusic|work=allmusic.com|accessdate=14 February 2017}}</ref> Z recalled of the Pepsi advert: \"It was all over television, and there was no doubt as to what had inspired the sound, but it was before people thought seriously about protecting things like sounds. The legalities of sampling were still being thrashed out. No one was sure if you could copyright a beat or a groove.\"<ref name=autogenerated9 /> He proposed to his lawyer about tackling the Pepsi advert, who responded that Pepsi would win any court case duel to them having \"a lot of money and a lot of lawyers.\"<ref name=autogenerated9 />\n\nIn a list for ''[[The Quietus]]'', [[Pauline Black]] of [[The Selecter]] named ''The Raw & the Cooked'' as one of her 13 favourite albums ever. At the time of the album's release, she had \"given up on music\" and turned to acting, but said the album renewed her faith in music and inspired her to reform The Selecter, saying \"When I heard the album, I wished I'd done it myself. They were messing around with Tamla and soul and creating their own sound with it. Andy Cox said it was 30 years of pop music condensed into 30 minutes and that\u2019s what it was; everything that had influenced me all wrapped up and repackaged.
