In contrast to some other fictitious [[Faster-than-light]] technologies such as a [[Hyperspace|jump drive]], the warp drive does not permit instantaneous travel between two points, but rather involves a measurable passage of time which is pertinent to the concept. In contrast to hyperdrive, spacecraft at warp velocity would continue to interact with objects in \"normal space.\" The general concept of \"warp drive\" was introduced by [[John W. Campbell]] in his 1931 novel ''[[Islands of Space]]''.<ref>J. Gardiner, \"Warp Drive - From Imagination to Reality\", [[Journal of the British Interplanetary Society]], vol. 61, p. 353-357 (2008)</ref>\n\nEinstein's theory of [[special relativity]] states that energy and mass are interchangeable, and speed of light travel is impossible for material objects that weigh more than [[photon]]s. The problem of a material object exceeding light speed is that an infinite amount of kinetic energy would be required to travel at exactly the speed of light. This can theoretically be solved by warping space to move an object instead of increasing the kinetic energy of the object to do so.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bibliotecapleyades.net/ciencia/negativeenergy/negativeenergy.htm|title=L.H Ford and T.A.

When beginning to explain travel times to the illusion survivors (before being interrupted by the sight of Vina), crewmember Jose stated that \"the time barrier's been broken\", allowing a group of interstellar travelers to return to Earth far sooner than would have otherwise been possible. Later in the pilot, when Spock is faced with the only action of escaping, he announces to the crew they have no choice but to leave, stating \"Our time warp factor{{nbsp}}...\" before the ship's systems start failing. In the second pilot for ''The Original Series'', \"[[Where No Man Has Gone Before (TOS episode)|Where No Man Has Gone Before]]\", ''time'' was dropped from the speed setting with Kirk ordering speeds in the simple \"ahead warp factor one\" that became so familiar from then on.\n\nThe warp drive velocity in ''Star Trek'' is generally expressed in \"warp factor\" units, which\u2014according to ''[[Star Trek Star Fleet Technical Manual]]''\u2014corresponds to the magnitude of the warp field. Achieving warp factor{{nbsp}}1 is equal to breaking the light barrier, while the actual velocity corresponding to higher factors is determined using an ambiguous formula. \nAccording to the ''Star Trek'' episode writer's guide for ''The Original Series'', warp factors are converted to multiples of the speed of light by [[multiplication]] with the [[cubic function]] of the warp factor itself. Accordingly, \"warp 1\" is equivalent to the speed of light, \"warp 2\" is eight times the speed of light, \"warp 3\" is 27 times the speed of light, etc. Several episodes of ''The Original Series'' placed the ''Enterprise'' in peril by having it travel at high warp factors. However, the velocity (in present dimensional units) of any given warp factor is rarely the subject of explicit expression, and travel times for specific interstellar distances are not consistent through the various series. In the ''[[Star Trek: The Next Generation Technical Manual]]'' it was written that the real warp speed depends on external factors such as particle density or electromagnetic fields and only roughly corresponds with the calculated speed of current warp factor. The reference work ''[[Star Trek Maps]]'' established the theory of subspace (or warp) highways. In certain regions, a spaceship can fly at a multiple of the speed that corresponds to the current warp factor. it depends on vectors of albert's reserches.\n\nIn ''The Original Series'', warp factor{{nbsp}}6 was established as the common speed of the USS ''Enterprise'' NCC-1701. In some cases, the starship traveled at warp{{nbsp}}7 or above, but with risk of damaging the ship or the engines. Warp{{nbsp}}9 in ''The Original Series'' was the \"never exceed\" speed for the hulls and engines of ''Constitution-''class starships, equivalent to the aircraft V<sub>NE</sub> [[V speeds|V-speed]]. Warp{{nbsp}}6 was the V<sub>NO</sub> \"Normal Operation\" maximum ''safe'' cruising speed for that vessel class.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Whitfield, Stephen E.|title=The making of Star trek|others=Roddenberry, Gene|isbn=0-345-02697-7|edition=First|location=New York|oclc=23859|year=1968}}</ref> Only five stories in the original ''Star Trek'' series involved the ''Enterprise'' traveling beyond warp{{nbsp}}9. In any instance, it was a result of the influence of alien beings or foreign technology. The warp 14.1 incident in ''[[That Which Survives]]'' was the result of runaway engines which brought the hull within seconds of structural failure before power was disengaged.<ref name=\"Warp Velocities FAQ\">{{cite web|url=http://www.calormen.com/star_trek/FAQs/warp_velocities-faq.htm|title=REC.ARTS.STARTREK.TECH FAQ: Warp Velocities|website=www.calormen.com}}</ref>\n\nLater on, a prequel series titled ''[[Star Trek: Enterprise]]'' describes the warp engine technology as a \"Gravimetric Field Displacement Manifold\" ([[Trip Tucker|Commander Tucker]]'s tour, \"[[Cold Front (Star Trek: Enterprise)|Cold Front]]\"), and describes the device as being powered by a matter/anti-matter reaction which powers the two separate nacelles (one on each side of the ship) to create a displacement field. ''Enterprise'', set in 2151 and onwards, follows the voyages of the [[Enterprise (NX-01)|first human ship]] capable of traveling at warp factor 5.2, which under the old warp table formula (the cube of the warp factor times the speed of light), is about 140 times the speed of light (i.e., 5.2 cubed). In the series pilot episode \"[[Broken Bow (Star Trek: Enterprise)|Broken Bow]]\", [[Jonathan Archer|Capt. Archer]] equates warp 4.5 to \"[[Neptune]] and back [from Earth] in six minutes\" (which would correspond to a distance of 547 light-minutes or 66 [[astronomical unit|au]], consistent with Neptune's being a minimum of 29 au distant from Earth).\n\n===Modified warp scale \u2013 ''The Next Generation'', ''Deep Space Nine'' , ''Voyager'' and ''Picard''===\n[[File:Warptable.gif|upright=1.4|thumb|Michael Okuda's new warp scale]]\nFor ''[[Star Trek: The Next Generation]]'' and the subsequent series, ''Star Trek'' artist [[Michael Okuda]] drew up a new warp scale and devised a formula based on the original one but with an important difference: In the [[half-open interval]] from 9{{nbsp}}to 10, the exponent{{nbsp}}''w'' increases toward infinity. Thus, in the Okuda scale, warp velocities approach warp 10 [[asymptotically]]. According to the ''[[Star Trek: The Next Generation Technical Manual]]'' there is no exact formula for this interval because the quoted velocities are based on a hand-drawn curve; what can be said is that at velocities greater than warp 9, the form of the warp function changes because of an increase in the exponent of the warp factor{{nbsp}}''w''. Due to the resultant increase in the [[derivative]], even minor changes in the warp factor eventually correspond to a greater than exponential change in velocity. Warp Factor 10 was set as an unattainable maximum (according to the new scale, reaching or exceeding warp 10 required an infinite amount of energy). This is described in ''[[List of Star Trek technical manuals|Star Trek Technical Manuals]]'' as \"Eugene's limit\", in homage to creator/producer [[Gene Roddenberry]].\n\nIn ''Star Trek: The Next Generation Technical Manual'' it was established that the normal operating speed of the ''Enterprise''-D (''Galaxy''-class) was warp{{nbsp}}6 (new scale), the maximum rated cruise was warp 9.2 and the maximum design speed of warp factor 9.6. In two episodes, the [[USS Enterprise (NCC-1701-D)|''Enterprise''-D]] could travel at warp 9.8 at \"extreme risk\", while fleeing from an enemy. According to the ''Star Trek: Deep Space Nine Technical Manual'' the ''Galaxy''-class starships and some other starfleet vessels like ''Nebula''-class or ''Excelsior''-class were refitted during the [[Dominion War]] with newer technology including modifications which increased their maximum speed to warp 9.9.\n\nAccording to the reference book ''[[USS Enterprise Owners' Workshop Manual]]'' the [[USS Enterprise (NCC-1701-E)|''Enterprise''-E]] can reach a maximum velocity of warp 9.95. The ''[[Star Trek: Starship Spotter]]'' reference book states that the ''Intrepid''-class starship ''[[USS Voyager (NCC-74656)|Voyager]]'' has a maximum sustainable cruising speed of warp 9.975, while the ''Prometheus''-class can reach a maximum of warp 9.99, with maximum cruising speed of warp 9.9.\n\nAs stated in the collection ''Star Trek Fact Files'', no ship, including highly developed ships like the Borg cube, may exceed warp factor 9.99 with their normal warp drive. To achieve higher speeds, the use of [[transwarp]] technology is required.\n\n===Warp velocities===<!--\nSection title used as anchor at [[USS Enterprise (NCC-1701-D)]]: please amend there if altering -->\nIn the book ''[[Star Trek Encyclopedia]]'', some warp velocities are given directly.

It follows that warp{{nbsp}}4, the stated maximum speed of the shuttle, is about 100 times the speed of light. In the movie ''[[Star Trek: Beyond]]'' it is stated that the USS ''Franklin'' (NX-326) was the first Earth ship who was capable of warp 4. Montgomery Scott (Simon Pegg): \"This is the USS ''Franklin'', sir, can you believe it?

The distance from Earth to Neptune varies all the time as both planets orbit the sun, however the average distance between the two is around 30.63 au (4.58 billion km) and 29.76 au (4.45 billion km) average 4.52 billion km. Therefore, a round trip of 9.04 billion km in six minutes would imply that warp 4.5 is about 84 times the speed of light.\n|-\n| 5 || 213&times; || 125&times; || 213&times; || In the ''[[Star Trek: Enterprise]]'' episode \"[[The Expanse (Star Trek: Enterprise episode)|The Expanse]]\", Captain Archer says the flight to the Delphic Expanse is equivalent to a three-month trip. Upon arrival of the ''Enterprise'', the distance to Earth is given as 50 light years. Thus, warp{{nbsp}}5, the maximum speed of the ''Enterprise'', corresponds to about 200 times the speed of light.\n|-\n| 6 || 392&times; || 216&times; || 392&times; ||\n|-\n| 7 || 656&times; || 343&times; || 656&times;|| In the ''[[Star Trek: Enterprise]]'' episode \"[[E\u00b2]]\", the ''Enterprise'' will fly through an 11.6 light year long subspace corridor for a meeting with Degra. However, the ''Enterprise'' is thrown 117 years into the past. As the older ''Enterprise'' encounters their younger counterpart (to warn them), Captain Lorian suggests modifying the warp drive so that the younger ''Enterprise'' can briefly reach warp Factor 6.9 and cover this distance in about two days without using the corridor. Thus, warp 6.9 corresponds to about 2117 times the speed of light. In the ''[[Star Trek: Discovery]]'' episode \"[[New Eden (Star Trek: Discovery episode)|New Eden]]\" (S2:E2), Commander Michael Burnham says a signal \"is in the Beta Quadrant, 51,450 light years away,\" to which Captain Christopher Pike replies, \"at top speed that would take us 150 years to get that far,\" indicating the maximum speed of the ''Discovery'' is 343 times the speed of light (51,450 light years / 150 years).

The warp drive has a natural physical or economical limit beyond which higher speeds are no longer possible. The reference work ''Star Trek Fact Files'' indicates this limit at warp factor 9.99. This is the highest conventional warp speed mentioned for a spaceship (Borg cube). Also in the episode ''Threshold'' (''Star Trek Voyager'') the warp factor 9.99 is suggested as the limit. This is the last warp factor mentioned before the leap takes place in the transwarp state.\n\nIn the book ''[[Star Trek: The Next Generation Technical Manual]]'' the authors describes the idea of transwarp: <blockquote>Finally, we had to create a back door for various powerful aliens like Q who got the knack of hurling the ship through the room for millions of light years during a commercial break.</blockquote>\n\nThe transwarp concept itself is not tied to any particular technology or speed limit.\n\nThe first mention of a transwarp drive took place in the movie ''[[Star Trek III: The Search for Spock]]''. There, the Starfleet developed a new spaceship type, the USS ''Excelsior'' (NX-2000), which should have a superior engine. The ''Excelsior'' captain plans to break the speed record of the USS ''Enterprise'' (warp 14.1 cubic scale). The principle of this drive is not explained. Later, in ''[[Star Trek VI: The Undiscovered Country]]'', the USS ''Excelsior'' had a normal warp drive. In '' Star Trek Fact Files '' it is stated that the experiment was a failure and the spaceship was converted to a normal warp drive.\n\nThe entire episode ''Threshold'' from ''Star Trek Voyager'' is about a transwarp experiment by the USS ''Voyager'' crew. To get home faster, a shuttle is modified with novel dilithium crystals. The crew is trying to break the transwarp threshold. This threshold is between warp 9.99 and warp 10, and transwarp itself represented the infinite speed. The shuttle allegedly found itself at all points in the universe at the same time during the flight. However, the pilot suffers genetic mutations after the flight, so it is not repeated. Due to the shuttle's limited memory, only a small portion of the sensor data was recorded. The entire experiment is described in the reference work ''Star Trek Fact Files''.\n\nSome episodes later, fictionalized a few months later, the crew of USS ''Voyager'' encounters a species called the [[Voth]]. This species has spaceships with transwarp drive. However, this drive does not work on the basis of transwarp conduits, as the transwarp drive of the Borg, but is a further development of the conventional warp drive.\n\nThe mention of a second transwarp technology took place in the episode ''[[Descent (Star Trek: The Next Generation)|Descent]]'' of the series ''Star Trek: The Next Generation''. A group of renegade [[Borg (Star Trek)|Borg]] used transwarp conduits. These are [[Wormhole|wormhole-like tunnels]] through [[Subspace (Star Trek)|subspace]]. It was said in the dialogue that the flight through these tunnels was 20 times faster than the flight with maximum warp speed of the ''Enterprise''. The flight itself was described as follows: \"falling into a fast-moving river and getting swept away by the current.\" In the episode ''[[Endgame (Star Trek: Voyager)|Endgame]]'' it is explained that the origin of these corridors was in six transwarp hubs spread across the galaxy. There were two ways to use these conduits outside these hubs. In ''The Next Generation'', the ''Enterprise'' was able to open such a channel with a precisely modulated tachyon impulse, traveling 65 light-years. However, when the USS ''Voyager'' tried the same thing in ''[[Day of Honor]]'', the attempt failed and almost destroyed the ship. The second possibility is the use of the transwarp coil. In episode ''[[Dark Frontier]]'' the crew of ''Voyager'' steals such a coil from the Borg and is able to shorten their journey home by 15 years, before the coil burns out.\n\n====Quantum slipstream====\n<!--Section title used as anchor for Redirect [[Quantum Slipstream]]: please amend there if altering -->\nAnother form of transwarp used in ''Star Trek'' is called ''Quantum Slipstream''.\n\nSimilar to the [[Borg (Star Trek)|Borg]] [[transwarp]] conduits, the slipstream is a narrowly focused, directed field that is initiated by manipulating the fabric of the space-time continuum using the starship's [[navigational deflector]] array. This creates a [[Subspace (Star Trek)|subspace]] tunnel, which is projected ahead of the vessel. Once a ship has entered this tunnel, the forces inside propel it at incredible speed. To maintain the slipstream, a ship has to constantly modify the quantum field with its [[deflector dish]]. The speed of the drive is inversely proportional to the time and distance. When the crew enters the ''Dauntless'' in the episode ''[[Hope and Fear]]'' for the first time and accidentally activates the propulsion system, the spaceship flies a flight of 15 light-years over a period of about 10 seconds. That is equivalent to approximately 50 million times the speed of light. After realizing that they would have to leave ''Voyager'' forever to get home with the ''Dauntless'', the crew tries to match the drive of the USS ''Voyager'' to the parameters of the ''Dauntless''. The modified ''Voyager'' is able to cover a distance of 300 light years with the slipstream modification before the system becomes unstable. The way back to Earth is stated in a fake message, created by Arturis, with seven months aboard the ''Dauntless''. For this period, the stocks are filled. At a residual distance of 60,000 light years at this time, this would correspond to a speed of about 100,000 times the speed of light or 1/500th of the time of a short slipstream jump.\n\nHowever, in the episode \"[[Timeless (Voyager episode)|Timeless]]\", the technology proved to be dangerously unstable, resulting in the loss of all hands of the ''Voyager'' in an alternate timeline. Due to a phase variance, the slipstream tunnel, produced by a replica slipstream drive of the ''Voyager'', collapsed during the flight and the ship crashed on a planet near the edge of the [[Beta Quadrant]]. [[Harry Kim (Star Trek)|Harry Kim]] and [[Chakotay]] survived, because they used the ''Delta Flyer'', which flew ahead of the ''Voyager'', and reached the Earth safely. They used, some years after this event, a temporal communication device to change the timeline and rescue the ship and the crew.\n\n===Folding space===\n<!--Section title used as anchor for Redirect [[coaxial warp drive]]: please amend there if altering -->\nIn addition to the possibility to let a spaceship glide through space in a warp field, there is also [[space folding]] in ''Star Trek''. Spatial folding means that two points of space-time are directly connected and an instantaneous change takes place. The space between is simply folded into a higher-dimensional hyperspace or subspace.\n\nIn the episode ''[[That Which Survives]]'' of ''The Original Series'', the ''Enterprise'' encountered the remains of people called [[Kalandans]]. These are able to instantaneously teleport spaceships as well as people over long distances.\n\nIn the episode ''[[Contagion (Star Trek: The Next Generation)|Contagion]]'' of the series ''Star Trek: The Next Generation'', the ''Enterprise''-D discovered the former homeworld of the [[Iconian]]s. These people were able to instantaneously teleport people over long distances with the help of Iconian Gateways. To ensure the gateway did not fall into the wrong hands, [[Jean-Luc Picard|Captain Picard]] destroyed it.\n\nA year later, in ''[[The High Ground (Star Trek: The Next Generation)|The High Ground]]'', terrorists on the planet Rutia IV used a space folding teleporter called an Inverter. However, this caused progressive physical harm to people during transport; multiple use almost always ended in death.\n\nThe USS ''Voyager'' came in touch with this technology several times on their way home. In the episode ''[[Prime Factors (Star Trek: Voyager)|Prime Factors]]'' the crew tried to buy a Spatial Trajector from the Sikarians. This wraps an object in a kind of subspace bubble, and teleports it to another location using spatial folding. The range was 40,000 light-years. However, the technology was not compatible with the warp core and almost destroyed ''Voyager'' when it was used.\n\nThree years later, in the episode ''[[Vis \u00e0 Vis (Star Trek: Voyager)|Vis \u00e0 Vis]]'', ''Voyager'' discovered a stranded spaceship with a coaxial warp drive. This also used spatial folding for locomotion. But the system was very unstable and if there is a fault in the drive it could cause a tear in the space-time continuum. A replica of the drive was only tested in a shuttle and never used for the ''Voyager''.\n\nLast but not least, spatial folding appeared as a Geodesic Fold in the episode ''[[Inside Man (Star Trek: Voyager)|Inside Man]]''. A geodesic fold occurs when a Verteron beam is fired at the atmosphere of a giant star at two different locations. This connects both points in space and creates a short lived passage. However, this was not usable because of deadly radiation that occurred during flight. A Ferengi ship's faked message from the Alpha Quadrant made the crew believe there was a safe passage. However, the Ferengi only wanted to get the Borg technology aboard ''Voyager'' and would have let the crew die. At the last moment, travel through the passage was aborted.\n\n===Fictional history===\nThe episode \"[[Metamorphosis (Star Trek)|Metamorphosis]]\", from ''The Original Series'', establishes a backstory for the invention of warp drive on Earth, in which [[Zefram Cochrane]] discovered the \"space warp\". Cochrane is repeatedly referred to afterwards, but the exact details of the first warp trials were not shown until the second ''[[Star Trek: The Next Generation]]'' movie, ''[[Star Trek: First Contact]]''. The movie depicts Cochrane as having first operated a warp drive on Earth in 2063. This successful first trial led directly to first contact with the [[Vulcan (Star Trek)|Vulcans]].\n\nIt was also established that many other civilizations had warp drive before humans; ''First Contact'' co-writer [[Ronald D. Moore]] suggested Cochrane's drive was in some way superior to forms which existed beforehand, and was gradually adopted by the galaxy at large.<ref name=\"ron063\">Moore, Ronald D. (1997-10-07). Memory Alpha:AOL chats/Ronald D. Moore/ron063.txt. ''memory-alpha.org'', 7 October 1997. Retrieved from http://memory-alpha.org/wiki/Memory_Alpha:AOL_chats/Ronald_D._Moore/ron063.txt.</ref>\n\n===Slingshot effect===\nThe \"[[Gravity assist|slingshot effect]]\" is first depicted in \"[[Tomorrow Is Yesterday]]\" (1967) as a method of [[time travel]]. The procedure involves traveling at a high warp velocity in the proximity to a star, on a precisely calculated \"slingshot\" path; if successful, it causes a ship to enter a time warp, leading to the past or future. The same technique is used in the episode \"[[Assignment: Earth]]\" (1968) for historic research. The term \"''time warp''\" was first used in \"[[The Naked Time (TOS episode)|The Naked Time]]\" (1966) when a previously untried cold-start intermix of matter and antimatter threw the ''[[USS Enterprise (NCC-1701)|Enterprise]]'' back three days in time. The term was later used in ''Star Trek IV'' in describing the slingshot effect. The technique was mentioned as a viable method of time travel in ''The Next Generation'' episode \"[[Time Squared (Star Trek: The Next Generation)|Time Squared]]\" (1989). The equations used to calculate the time warp trajectory are extremely complicated, understood only by a select few, with even the most minuscule error resulting in catastrophe.\n\nThis \"slingshot\" effect has been explored in theoretical physics: it is hypothetically possible to slingshot oneself \"around\" the [[event horizon]] of a [[black hole]]. As a result of the black hole's extreme gravitation, time would pass at a slower rate near the event horizon, relative to the outside universe; the traveler would experience the passage of only several minutes or hours, while hundreds of years would pass in 'normal' space.\n\n===Warp core===<!-- This section is linked from [[Space Battleship Yamato]] -->\nA primary component of the warp drive method of propulsion in the ''Star Trek'' universe is the \"gravimetric field displacement manifold\", more commonly referred to as a ''warp core''. It is a fictional reactor that taps the energy released in a [[matter]]-[[antimatter]] annihilation to provide the energy necessary to power a starship's warp drive, allowing [[faster-than-light]] travel. Starship warp cores generally also serve as powerplants for other primary ship systems.\n\nWhen matter and antimatter come into contact, they [[Annihilation|annihilate]]\u2014both matter and antimatter are converted directly and entirely into enormous quantities of energy, in the form of [[Annihilation#Proton-antiproton annihilation|subnuclear particles and electromagnetic radiation]] (specifically, [[mesons]] and [[gamma rays]]). In the ''Star Trek'' universe, fictional \"[[Dilithium (Star Trek)|dilithium crystals]]\" are used to regulate this reaction. These crystals are described as being non-reactive to anti-matter when bombarded with high levels of radiation.\n\nUsually, the reactants are [[deuterium]], which is an [[isotope]] of [[hydrogen]], and [[Deuterium#Anti-deuterium|antideuterium]] (its [[antimatter]] counterpart). In ''The Original Series'' and in-universe chronologically subsequent series, the warp core reaction chamber is often referred to as the \"dilithium intermix chamber\" or the \"matter/antimatter reaction chamber\", depending upon the ship's intermix type. The reaction chamber is surrounded by powerful magnetic fields to contain the anti-matter. If the containment fields ever fail, the subsequent interaction of the antimatter fuel with the container walls would result in a catastrophic release of energy, with the resultant explosion capable of utterly destroying the ship. Such \"warp core breaches\" are used as plot devices in many ''Star Trek'' episodes. An intentional warp core breach can also be deliberately created, as one of the methods by which a starship can be made to [[self-destruct]].\n\nThe mechanism that provides a starship's propulsive force is the \"warp nacelle\", a cylindrical pod (or pods) offset from the hull. Nacelles generate the actual \"warp bubble\" outside the ship; destruction of a nacelle will cripple the ship and possibly cause a warp core breach.\n\n[[File:Warp Requirements for 10m OD Sphere.jpg|thumb|upright=1.6|Warp requirements for 10m OD sphere]]\n\n==Real-world theories and science==\nIn 1994, physicist [[Miguel Alcubierre]] formulated a theoretical solution, called the [[Alcubierre drive]], for faster-than-light travel which models the warp drive concept.<ref name=\"AIAA-20190816\">{{cite journal |last=Agnew |first=J. |title=An Examination of Warp Theory and Technology to Determine the State of the Art and Feasibility |url=https://arc.aiaa.org/doi/10.2514/6.2019-4288 |date=16 August 2019 |journal=[[American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics#Conferences|AIAA Propulsion and Energy Forum and Exposition]] |doi=10.2514/6.2019-4288 |accessdate=2 March 2020 }}</ref><ref name=\"SA-20200301\">{{cite news |last=Williams |first=Matt |title=Scientists Are Starting to Take Warp Drives Seriously, Especially This One Concept |url=https://www.sciencealert.com/scientists-are-starting-to-take-warp-drives-seriously-especially-this-one-concept |date=1 March 2020 |work=ScieneAlert.com |accessdate=2 March 2020 }}</ref> Calculations found that such a model would require prohibitive amounts of [[negative energy]] or mass.<ref>{{cite magazine|url=http://www.bibliotecapleyades.net/ciencia/negativeenergy/negativeenergy.htm|title=Negative Energy: Wormholes and Warp Drive|magazine=[[Scientific American]]|date=2000-01-01|author=Ford, Lawrence H.; Roman, Thomas A.}}</ref>\n\nIn 2012, NASA researcher Harold White hypothesized that by changing the shape of the warp drive, much less [[negative mass]] and energy could be used, though the energy required ranges from the mass of [[Voyager 1]] to the mass of the observable universe, or many orders of magnitude greater than anything currently possible by modern technology.

In contrast to some other fictitious [[Faster-than-light]] technologies such as a [[Hyperspace|jump drive]], the warp drive does not permit instantaneous travel between two points, but rather involves a measurable passage of time which is pertinent to the concept. In contrast to hyperdrive, spacecraft at warp velocity would continue to interact with objects in \"normal space.\" The general concept of \"warp drive\" was introduced by [[John W. Campbell]] in his 1931 novel ''[[Islands of Space]]''.<ref>J. Gardiner, \"Warp Drive - From Imagination to Reality\", [[Journal of the British Interplanetary Society]], vol. 61, p. 353-357 (2008)</ref>\n\nEinstein's theory of [[special relativity]] states that energy and mass are interchangeable, and speed of light travel is impossible for material objects that weigh more than [[photon]]s. The problem of a material object exceeding light speed is that an infinite amount of kinetic energy would be required to travel at exactly the speed of light. This can theoretically be solved by warping space to move an object instead of increasing the kinetic energy of the object to do so.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bibliotecapleyades.net/ciencia/negativeenergy/negativeenergy.htm|title=L.H Ford and T.A.

When beginning to explain travel times to the illusion survivors (before being interrupted by the sight of Vina), crewmember Jose stated that \"the time barrier's been broken\", allowing a group of interstellar travelers to return to Earth far sooner than would have otherwise been possible. Later in the pilot, when Spock is faced with the only action of escaping, he announces to the crew they have no choice but to leave, stating \"Our time warp factor{{nbsp}}...\" before the ship's systems start failing. In the second pilot for ''The Original Series'', \"[[Where No Man Has Gone Before (TOS episode)|Where No Man Has Gone Before]]\", ''time'' was dropped from the speed setting with Kirk ordering speeds in the simple \"ahead warp factor one\" that became so familiar from then on.\n\nThe warp drive velocity in ''Star Trek'' is generally expressed in \"warp factor\" units, which\u2014according to ''[[Star Trek Star Fleet Technical Manual]]''\u2014corresponds to the magnitude of the warp field. Achieving warp factor{{nbsp}}1 is equal to breaking the light barrier, while the actual velocity corresponding to higher factors is determined using an ambiguous formula. \nAccording to the ''Star Trek'' episode writer's guide for ''The Original Series'', warp factors are converted to multiples of the speed of light by [[multiplication]] with the [[cubic function]] of the warp factor itself. Accordingly, \"warp 1\" is equivalent to the speed of light, \"warp 2\" is eight times the speed of light, \"warp 3\" is 27 times the speed of light, etc. Several episodes of ''The Original Series'' placed the ''Enterprise'' in peril by having it travel at high warp factors. However, the velocity (in present dimensional units) of any given warp factor is rarely the subject of explicit expression, and travel times for specific interstellar distances are not consistent through the various series. In the ''[[Star Trek: The Next Generation Technical Manual]]'' it was written that the real warp speed depends on external factors such as particle density or electromagnetic fields and only roughly corresponds with the calculated speed of current warp factor. The reference work ''[[Star Trek Maps]]'' established the theory of subspace (or warp) highways. In certain regions, a spaceship can fly at a multiple of the speed that corresponds to the current warp factor.\n\nIn ''The Original Series'', warp factor{{nbsp}}6 was established as the common speed of the USS ''Enterprise'' NCC-1701. In some cases, the starship traveled at warp{{nbsp}}7 or above, but with risk of damaging the ship or the engines. Warp{{nbsp}}9 in ''The Original Series'' was the \"never exceed\" speed for the hulls and engines of ''Constitution-''class starships, equivalent to the aircraft V<sub>NE</sub> [[V speeds|V-speed]]. Warp{{nbsp}}6 was the V<sub>NO</sub> \"Normal Operation\" maximum ''safe'' cruising speed for that vessel class.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Whitfield, Stephen E.|title=The making of Star trek|others=Roddenberry, Gene|isbn=0-345-02697-7|edition=First|location=New York|oclc=23859|year=1968}}</ref> Only five stories in the original ''Star Trek'' series involved the ''Enterprise'' traveling beyond warp{{nbsp}}9. In any instance, it was a result of the influence of alien beings or foreign technology. The warp 14.1 incident in ''[[That Which Survives]]'' was the result of runaway engines which brought the hull within seconds of structural failure before power was disengaged.<ref name=\"Warp Velocities FAQ\">{{cite web|url=http://www.calormen.com/star_trek/FAQs/warp_velocities-faq.htm|title=REC.ARTS.STARTREK.TECH FAQ: Warp Velocities|website=www.calormen.com}}</ref>\n\nLater on, a prequel series titled ''[[Star Trek: Enterprise]]'' describes the warp engine technology as a \"Gravimetric Field Displacement Manifold\" ([[Trip Tucker|Commander Tucker]]'s tour, \"[[Cold Front (Star Trek: Enterprise)|Cold Front]]\"), and describes the device as being powered by a matter/anti-matter reaction which powers the two separate nacelles (one on each side of the ship) to create a displacement field. ''Enterprise'', set in 2151 and onwards, follows the voyages of the [[Enterprise (NX-01)|first human ship]] capable of traveling at warp factor 5.2, which under the old warp table formula (the cube of the warp factor times the speed of light), is about 140 times the speed of light (i.e., 5.2 cubed). In the series pilot episode \"[[Broken Bow (Star Trek: Enterprise)|Broken Bow]]\", [[Jonathan Archer|Capt. Archer]] equates warp 4.5 to \"[[Neptune]] and back [from Earth] in six minutes\" (which would correspond to a distance of 547 light-minutes or 66 [[astronomical unit|au]], consistent with Neptune's being a minimum of 29 au distant from Earth).\n\n===Modified warp scale \u2013 ''The Next Generation'', ''Deep Space Nine'' , ''Voyager'' and ''Picard''===\n[[File:Warptable.gif|upright=1.4|thumb|Michael Okuda's new warp scale]]\nFor ''[[Star Trek: The Next Generation]]'' and the subsequent series, ''Star Trek'' artist [[Michael Okuda]] drew up a new warp scale and devised a formula based on the original one but with an important difference: In the [[half-open interval]] from 9{{nbsp}}to 10, the exponent{{nbsp}}''w'' increases toward infinity. Thus, in the Okuda scale, warp velocities approach warp 10 [[asymptotically]]. According to the ''[[Star Trek: The Next Generation Technical Manual]]'' there is no exact formula for this interval because the quoted velocities are based on a hand-drawn curve; what can be said is that at velocities greater than warp 9, the form of the warp function changes because of an increase in the exponent of the warp factor{{nbsp}}''w''. Due to the resultant increase in the [[derivative]], even minor changes in the warp factor eventually correspond to a greater than exponential change in velocity. Warp Factor 10 was set as an unattainable maximum (according to the new scale, reaching or exceeding warp 10 required an infinite amount of energy). This is described in ''[[List of Star Trek technical manuals|Star Trek Technical Manuals]]'' as \"Eugene's limit\", in homage to creator/producer [[Gene Roddenberry]].\n\nIn ''Star Trek: The Next Generation Technical Manual'' it was established that the normal operating speed of the ''Enterprise''-D (''Galaxy''-class) was warp{{nbsp}}6 (new scale), the maximum rated cruise was warp 9.2 and the maximum design speed of warp factor 9.6. In two episodes, the [[USS Enterprise (NCC-1701-D)|''Enterprise''-D]] could travel at warp 9.8 at \"extreme risk\", while fleeing from an enemy. According to the ''Star Trek: Deep Space Nine Technical Manual'' the ''Galaxy''-class starships and some other starfleet vessels like ''Nebula''-class or ''Excelsior''-class were refitted during the [[Dominion War]] with newer technology including modifications which increased their maximum speed to warp 9.9.\n\nAccording to the reference book ''[[USS Enterprise Owners' Workshop Manual]]'' the [[USS Enterprise (NCC-1701-E)|''Enterprise''-E]] can reach a maximum velocity of warp 9.95. The ''[[Star Trek: Starship Spotter]]'' reference book states that the ''Intrepid''-class starship ''[[USS Voyager (NCC-74656)|Voyager]]'' has a maximum sustainable cruising speed of warp 9.975, while the ''Prometheus''-class can reach a maximum of warp 9.99, with maximum cruising speed of warp 9.9.\n\nAs stated in the collection ''Star Trek Fact Files'', no ship, including highly developed ships like the Borg cube, may exceed warp factor 9.99 with their normal warp drive. To achieve higher speeds, the use of [[transwarp]] technology is required.\n\n===Warp velocities===<!--\nSection title used as anchor at [[USS Enterprise (NCC-1701-D)]]: please amend there if altering -->\nIn the book ''[[Star Trek Encyclopedia]]'', some warp velocities are given directly.

It follows that warp{{nbsp}}4, the stated maximum speed of the shuttle, is about 100 times the speed of light. In the movie ''[[Star Trek: Beyond]]'' it is stated that the USS ''Franklin'' (NX-326) was the first Earth ship who was capable of warp 4. Montgomery Scott (Simon Pegg): \"This is the USS ''Franklin'', sir, can you believe it? First Earth ship capable of warp 4.\" It is unclear when the ''Franklin'' was first launched but it is speculated to be between 2145 and 2151.\n|-\n| 4.5 || 150&times; || 91&times; || 150&times; || In the ''[[Star Trek: Enterprise]]'' pilot \"[[Broken Bow (Star Trek: Enterprise)|Broken Bow]]\", Commander Tucker states \"warp 4.5 next Thursday\", to which Captain Archer responds \"Neptune and back in six minutes\".

Therefore, a round trip of 9.04 billion km in six minutes would imply that warp 4.5 is about 84 times the speed of light.\n|-\n| 5 || 213&times; || 125&times; || 213&times; || In the ''[[Star Trek: Enterprise]]'' episode \"[[The Expanse (Star Trek: Enterprise episode)|The Expanse]]\", Captain Archer says the flight to the Delphic Expanse is equivalent to a three-month trip.

As the older ''Enterprise'' encounters their younger counterpart (to warn them), Captain Lorian suggests modifying the warp drive so that the younger ''Enterprise'' can briefly reach warp Factor 6.9 and cover this distance in about two days without using the corridor. Thus, warp 6.9 corresponds to about 2117 times the speed of light. In the ''[[Star Trek: Discovery]]'' episode \"[[New Eden (Star Trek: Discovery episode)|New Eden]]\" (S2:E2), Commander Michael Burnham says a signal \"is in the Beta Quadrant, 51,450 light years away,\" to which Captain Christopher Pike replies, \"at top speed that would take us 150 years to get that far,\" indicating the maximum speed of the ''Discovery'' is 343 times the speed of light (51,450 light years / 150 years).

This corresponds with warp factor 18.56 of the cubic scale.\n|}\n\n===Transwarp===\n<!--Section title used as anchor for Redirect [[transwarp]]: please amend there if altering -->\nTranswarp generally refers to speeds and technologies that are beyond conventional warp drives. The warp drive has a natural physical or economical limit beyond which higher speeds are no longer possible. The reference work ''Star Trek Fact Files'' indicates this limit at warp factor 9.99. This is the highest conventional warp speed mentioned for a spaceship (Borg cube). Also in the episode ''Threshold'' (''Star Trek Voyager'') the warp factor 9.99 is suggested as the limit. This is the last warp factor mentioned before the leap takes place in the transwarp state.\n\nIn the book ''[[Star Trek: The Next Generation Technical Manual]]'' the authors describes the idea of transwarp: <blockquote>Finally, we had to create a back door for various powerful aliens like Q who got the knack of hurling the ship through the room for millions of light years during a commercial break.</blockquote>\n\nThe transwarp concept itself is not tied to any particular technology or speed limit.\n\nThe first mention of a transwarp drive took place in the movie ''[[Star Trek III: The Search for Spock]]''. There, the Starfleet developed a new spaceship type, the USS ''Excelsior'' (NX-2000), which should have a superior engine. The ''Excelsior'' captain plans to break the speed record of the USS ''Enterprise'' (warp 14.1 cubic scale). The principle of this drive is not explained. Later, in ''[[Star Trek VI: The Undiscovered Country]]'', the USS ''Excelsior'' had a normal warp drive. In '' Star Trek Fact Files '' it is stated that the experiment was a failure and the spaceship was converted to a normal warp drive.\n\nThe entire episode ''Threshold'' from ''Star Trek Voyager'' is about a transwarp experiment by the USS ''Voyager'' crew. To get home faster, a shuttle is modified with novel dilithium crystals. The crew is trying to break the transwarp threshold. This threshold is between warp 9.99 and warp 10, and transwarp itself represented the infinite speed. The shuttle allegedly found itself at all points in the universe at the same time during the flight. However, the pilot suffers genetic mutations after the flight, so it is not repeated. Due to the shuttle's limited memory, only a small portion of the sensor data was recorded. The entire experiment is described in the reference work ''Star Trek Fact Files''.\n\nSome episodes later, fictionalized a few months later, the crew of USS ''Voyager'' encounters a species called the [[Voth]]. This species has spaceships with transwarp drive. However, this drive does not work on the basis of transwarp conduits, as the transwarp drive of the Borg, but is a further development of the conventional warp drive.\n\nThe mention of a second transwarp technology took place in the episode ''[[Descent (Star Trek: The Next Generation)|Descent]]'' of the series ''Star Trek: The Next Generation''. A group of renegade [[Borg (Star Trek)|Borg]] used transwarp conduits. These are [[Wormhole|wormhole-like tunnels]] through [[Subspace (Star Trek)|subspace]]. It was said in the dialogue that the flight through these tunnels was 20 times faster than the flight with maximum warp speed of the ''Enterprise''. The flight itself was described as follows: \"falling into a fast-moving river and getting swept away by the current.\" In the episode ''[[Endgame (Star Trek: Voyager)|Endgame]]'' it is explained that the origin of these corridors was in six transwarp hubs spread across the galaxy. There were two ways to use these conduits outside these hubs. In ''The Next Generation'', the ''Enterprise'' was able to open such a channel with a precisely modulated tachyon impulse, traveling 65 light-years. However, when the USS ''Voyager'' tried the same thing in ''[[Day of Honor]]'', the attempt failed and almost destroyed the ship. The second possibility is the use of the transwarp coil. In episode ''[[Dark Frontier]]'' the crew of ''Voyager'' steals such a coil from the Borg and is able to shorten their journey home by 15 years, before the coil burns out.\n\n====Quantum slipstream====\n<!--Section title used as anchor for Redirect [[Quantum Slipstream]]: please amend there if altering -->\nAnother form of transwarp used in ''Star Trek'' is called ''Quantum Slipstream''.\n\nSimilar to the [[Borg (Star Trek)|Borg]] [[transwarp]] conduits, the slipstream is a narrowly focused, directed field that is initiated by manipulating the fabric of the space-time continuum using the starship's [[navigational deflector]] array. This creates a [[Subspace (Star Trek)|subspace]] tunnel, which is projected ahead of the vessel. Once a ship has entered this tunnel, the forces inside propel it at incredible speed. To maintain the slipstream, a ship has to constantly modify the quantum field with its [[deflector dish]]. The speed of the drive is inversely proportional to the time and distance. When the crew enters the ''Dauntless'' in the episode ''[[Hope and Fear]]'' for the first time and accidentally activates the propulsion system, the spaceship flies a flight of 15 light-years over a period of about 10 seconds. That is equivalent to approximately 50 million times the speed of light. After realizing that they would have to leave ''Voyager'' forever to get home with the ''Dauntless'', the crew tries to match the drive of the USS ''Voyager'' to the parameters of the ''Dauntless''. The modified ''Voyager'' is able to cover a distance of 300 light years with the slipstream modification before the system becomes unstable. The way back to Earth is stated in a fake message, created by Arturis, with seven months aboard the ''Dauntless''. For this period, the stocks are filled. At a residual distance of 60,000 light years at this time, this would correspond to a speed of about 100,000 times the speed of light or 1/500th of the time of a short slipstream jump.\n\nHowever, in the episode \"[[Timeless (Voyager episode)|Timeless]]\", the technology proved to be dangerously unstable, resulting in the loss of all hands of the ''Voyager'' in an alternate timeline. Due to a phase variance, the slipstream tunnel, produced by a replica slipstream drive of the ''Voyager'', collapsed during the flight and the ship crashed on a planet near the edge of the [[Beta Quadrant]]. [[Harry Kim (Star Trek)|Harry Kim]] and [[Chakotay]] survived, because they used the ''Delta Flyer'', which flew ahead of the ''Voyager'', and reached the Earth safely. They used, some years after this event, a temporal communication device to change the timeline and rescue the ship and the crew.\n\n===Folding space===\n<!--Section title used as anchor for Redirect [[coaxial warp drive]]: please amend there if altering -->\nIn addition to the possibility to let a spaceship glide through space in a warp field, there is also [[space folding]] in ''Star Trek''. Spatial folding means that two points of space-time are directly connected and an instantaneous change takes place. The space between is simply folded into a higher-dimensional hyperspace or subspace.\n\nIn the episode ''[[That Which Survives]]'' of ''The Original Series'', the ''Enterprise'' encountered the remains of people called [[Kalandans]]. These are able to instantaneously teleport spaceships as well as people over long distances.\n\nIn the episode ''[[Contagion (Star Trek: The Next Generation)|Contagion]]'' of the series ''Star Trek: The Next Generation'', the ''Enterprise''-D discovered the former homeworld of the [[Iconian]]s. These people were able to instantaneously teleport people over long distances with the help of Iconian Gateways. To ensure the gateway did not fall into the wrong hands, [[Jean-Luc Picard|Captain Picard]] destroyed it.\n\nA year later, in ''[[The High Ground (Star Trek: The Next Generation)|The High Ground]]'', terrorists on the planet Rutia IV used a space folding teleporter called an Inverter. However, this caused progressive physical harm to people during transport; multiple use almost always ended in death.\n\nThe USS ''Voyager'' came in touch with this technology several times on their way home. In the episode ''[[Prime Factors (Star Trek: Voyager)|Prime Factors]]'' the crew tried to buy a Spatial Trajector from the Sikarians. This wraps an object in a kind of subspace bubble, and teleports it to another location using spatial folding. The range was 40,000 light-years. However, the technology was not compatible with the warp core and almost destroyed ''Voyager'' when it was used.\n\nThree years later, in the episode ''[[Vis \u00e0 Vis (Star Trek: Voyager)|Vis \u00e0 Vis]]'', ''Voyager'' discovered a stranded spaceship with a coaxial warp drive. This also used spatial folding for locomotion. But the system was very unstable and if there is a fault in the drive it could cause a tear in the space-time continuum. A replica of the drive was only tested in a shuttle and never used for the ''Voyager''.\n\nLast but not least, spatial folding appeared as a Geodesic Fold in the episode ''[[Inside Man (Star Trek: Voyager)|Inside Man]]''. A geodesic fold occurs when a Verteron beam is fired at the atmosphere of a giant star at two different locations. This connects both points in space and creates a short lived passage. However, this was not usable because of deadly radiation that occurred during flight. A Ferengi ship's faked message from the Alpha Quadrant made the crew believe there was a safe passage. However, the Ferengi only wanted to get the Borg technology aboard ''Voyager'' and would have let the crew die. At the last moment, travel through the passage was aborted.\n\n===Fictional history===\nThe episode \"[[Metamorphosis (Star Trek)|Metamorphosis]]\", from ''The Original Series'', establishes a backstory for the invention of warp drive on Earth, in which [[Zefram Cochrane]] discovered the \"space warp\". Cochrane is repeatedly referred to afterwards, but the exact details of the first warp trials were not shown until the second ''[[Star Trek: The Next Generation]]'' movie, ''[[Star Trek: First Contact]]''. The movie depicts Cochrane as having first operated a warp drive on Earth in 2063. This successful first trial led directly to first contact with the [[Vulcan (Star Trek)|Vulcans]].\n\nIt was also established that many other civilizations had warp drive before humans; ''First Contact'' co-writer [[Ronald D. Moore]] suggested Cochrane's drive was in some way superior to forms which existed beforehand, and was gradually adopted by the galaxy at large.<ref name=\"ron063\">Moore, Ronald D. (1997-10-07). Memory Alpha:AOL chats/Ronald D. Moore/ron063.txt. ''memory-alpha.org'', 7 October 1997. Retrieved from http://memory-alpha.org/wiki/Memory_Alpha:AOL_chats/Ronald_D._Moore/ron063.txt.</ref>\n\n===Slingshot effect===\nThe \"[[Gravity assist|slingshot effect]]\" is first depicted in \"[[Tomorrow Is Yesterday]]\" (1967) as a method of [[time travel]]. The procedure involves traveling at a high warp velocity in the proximity to a star, on a precisely calculated \"slingshot\" path; if successful, it causes a ship to enter a time warp, leading to the past or future. The same technique is used in the episode \"[[Assignment: Earth]]\" (1968) for historic research. The term \"''time warp''\" was first used in \"[[The Naked Time (TOS episode)|The Naked Time]]\" (1966) when a previously untried cold-start intermix of matter and antimatter threw the ''[[USS Enterprise (NCC-1701)|Enterprise]]'' back three days in time. The term was later used in ''Star Trek IV'' in describing the slingshot effect. The technique was mentioned as a viable method of time travel in ''The Next Generation'' episode \"[[Time Squared (Star Trek: The Next Generation)|Time Squared]]\" (1989). The equations used to calculate the time warp trajectory are extremely complicated, understood only by a select few, with even the most minuscule error resulting in catastrophe.\n\nThis \"slingshot\" effect has been explored in theoretical physics: it is hypothetically possible to slingshot oneself \"around\" the [[event horizon]] of a [[black hole]]. As a result of the black hole's extreme gravitation, time would pass at a slower rate near the event horizon, relative to the outside universe; the traveler would experience the passage of only several minutes or hours, while hundreds of years would pass in 'normal' space.\n\n===Warp core===<!-- This section is linked from [[Space Battleship Yamato]] -->\nA primary component of the warp drive method of propulsion in the ''Star Trek'' universe is the \"gravimetric field displacement manifold\", more commonly referred to as a ''warp core''. It is a fictional reactor that taps the energy released in a [[matter]]-[[antimatter]] annihilation to provide the energy necessary to power a starship's warp drive, allowing [[faster-than-light]] travel. Starship warp cores generally also serve as powerplants for other primary ship systems.\n\nWhen matter and antimatter come into contact, they [[Annihilation|annihilate]]\u2014both matter and antimatter are converted directly and entirely into enormous quantities of energy, in the form of [[Annihilation#Proton-antiproton annihilation|subnuclear particles and electromagnetic radiation]] (specifically, [[mesons]] and [[gamma rays]]). In the ''Star Trek'' universe, fictional \"[[Dilithium (Star Trek)|dilithium crystals]]\" are used to regulate this reaction. These crystals are described as being non-reactive to anti-matter when bombarded with high levels of radiation.\n\nUsually, the reactants are [[deuterium]], which is an [[isotope]] of [[hydrogen]], and [[Deuterium#Anti-deuterium|antideuterium]] (its [[antimatter]] counterpart). In ''The Original Series'' and in-universe chronologically subsequent series, the warp core reaction chamber is often referred to as the \"dilithium intermix chamber\" or the \"matter/antimatter reaction chamber\", depending upon the ship's intermix type. The reaction chamber is surrounded by powerful magnetic fields to contain the anti-matter. If the containment fields ever fail, the subsequent interaction of the antimatter fuel with the container walls would result in a catastrophic release of energy, with the resultant explosion capable of utterly destroying the ship. Such \"warp core breaches\" are used as plot devices in many ''Star Trek'' episodes. An intentional warp core breach can also be deliberately created, as one of the methods by which a starship can be made to [[self-destruct]].\n\nThe mechanism that provides a starship's propulsive force is the \"warp nacelle\", a cylindrical pod (or pods) offset from the hull. Nacelles generate the actual \"warp bubble\" outside the ship; destruction of a nacelle will cripple the ship and possibly cause a warp core breach.\n\n[[File:Warp Requirements for 10m OD Sphere.jpg|thumb|upright=1.6|Warp requirements for 10m OD sphere]]\n\n==Real-world theories and science==\nIn 1994, physicist [[Miguel Alcubierre]] formulated a theoretical solution, called the [[Alcubierre drive]], for faster-than-light travel which models the warp drive concept.<ref name=\"AIAA-20190816\">{{cite journal |last=Agnew |first=J. |title=An Examination of Warp Theory and Technology to Determine the State of the Art and Feasibility |url=https://arc.aiaa.org/doi/10.2514/6.2019-4288 |date=16 August 2019 |journal=[[American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics#Conferences|AIAA Propulsion and Energy Forum and Exposition]] |doi=10.2514/6.2019-4288 |accessdate=2 March 2020 }}</ref><ref name=\"SA-20200301\">{{cite news |last=Williams |first=Matt |title=Scientists Are Starting to Take Warp Drives Seriously, Especially This One Concept |url=https://www.sciencealert.com/scientists-are-starting-to-take-warp-drives-seriously-especially-this-one-concept |date=1 March 2020 |work=ScieneAlert.com |accessdate=2 March 2020 }}</ref> Calculations found that such a model would require prohibitive amounts of [[negative energy]] or mass.<ref>{{cite magazine|url=http://www.bibliotecapleyades.net/ciencia/negativeenergy/negativeenergy.htm|title=Negative Energy: Wormholes and Warp Drive|magazine=[[Scientific American]]|date=2000-01-01|author=Ford, Lawrence H.; Roman, Thomas A.}}</ref>\n\nIn 2012, NASA researcher Harold White hypothesized that by changing the shape of the warp drive, much less [[negative mass]] and energy could be used, though the energy required ranges from the mass of [[Voyager 1]] to the mass of the observable universe, or many orders of magnitude greater than anything currently possible by modern technology.

Whatever the status and rights of the concubine, they were always inferior to those of the wife, and typically neither she nor her children had rights of inheritance. [[Courtesan|Especially]] among royalty and nobility, the woman in such relationships was commonly described as a [[Mistress (lover)|mistress]]. The children of such relationships were counted as [[illegitimate]] and in some societies were barred from inheriting the father's title or estates, even in the absence of legitimate heirs.\n\n==In Asia==\nConcubinage was highly popular before the early 20th century all over [[East Asia]]. The main function of concubinage was producing additional heirs, as well as bringing males pleasure. Children of concubines had lower rights in account to inheritance, which was regulated by the [[Dishu system]].\n\n=== Mongols ===\nPolygyny and concubinage were very common in Mongol society especially for powerful Mongol men. [[Genghis Khan]], [[\u00d6gedei Khan]], [[Jochi]], [[Tolui]], and [[Kublai Khan]] (among others) all had many wives and concubines.\n\nGenghis Khan frequently acquired wives and concubines from empires and societies that he had conquered, these women were often princesses or queens that were [[Bride kidnapping|taken captive]] or gifted to him.<ref name=\":02\">{{Cite book|last=Broadbridge|first=Anne F.|url=https://books.google.com/?id=RHOFDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&q&f=false|title=Women and the Making of the Mongol Empire|date=2018-07-18|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-1-108-63662-9|location=|pages=74, 92|language=en}}</ref> Genghis Khan's most famous concubine was [[M\u00f6ge Khatun]], according to the Persian historian [[Ata-Malik Juvayni]] she was \"given to Chinggis Khan by a chief of the [[Bakran tribe|Bakrin tribe]], and he loved her very much.\"<ref>{{cite book|last1=McClynn|first1=Frank|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RBZpCQAAQBAJ&pg=PT117|title=Genghis Khan: His Conquests, His Empire, His Legacy|date=14 July 2015|publisher=Hachette Books|isbn=978-0306823961|page=117}}</ref> After Genghis Khan died, M\u00f6ge Khatun became a wife of \u00d6gedei Khan. \u00d6gedei also favored her as a wife, and she frequently accompanied him on his [[Hunting|hunting expeditions]].<ref name=\"denicola\">{{cite book|last1=De Nicola|first1=Bruno|title=Women in Mongol Iran: The Khatuns, 1206-1335|date=2017|publisher=Edinburgh University Press|page=68}}</ref>\n\n===China===\n{{See also|Women in ancient and imperial China}}\n[[File:Hua-Qing-Chi-Yang-Gui-Fei.jpg|alt=|thumb|289x289px|Statue of [[Yang Guifei]] (719-756), the favoured concubine of Emperor [[Tang Xuanzong]] of [[China]].]]\n[[File:The Fourth Concubine of Hexing.jpg|thumb|upright|Portrait of a concubine, by Chinese painter [[Lam Qua]], 1864]]\nIn China, successful men often had concubines until the practice was outlawed when the [[Communist Party of China]] came to power in 1949. The standard Chinese term translated as \"concubine\" was ''qi\u00e8'' {{lang|zh|\u59be}}, a term that has been used since ancient times, which means \"concubine; I, your servant (deprecating self reference)\". Concubinage resembled marriage in that concubines were recognized sexual partners of a man and were expected to bear children for him. Unofficial concubines ({{zh|t=\u5a62\u59be|p=b\u00ec qi\u00e8}}) were of lower status, and their children were considered illegitimate. The English term concubine is also used for what the Chinese refer to as ''p\u00ednf\u0113i'' ({{zh|t=\u5b2a\u5983}}), or \"consorts of emperors\", an official position often carrying a very high rank.<ref>Patricia Buckley Ebrey (2002): ''Women and the Family in Chinese History''.

From the [[Han dynasty#Eastern Han|Eastern Han]] period (AD 25\u2013220) onward, the number of concubines a man could have was limited by law.

It became permissible to promote a concubine to wife, if the original wife had died and the concubine was the mother of the only surviving sons. Moreover, the prohibition against forcing a widow to remarry was extended to widowed concubines. During this period tablets for concubine-mothers seem to have been more commonly placed in family ancestral altars, and genealogies of some lineages listed concubine-mothers.<ref name=\"Ebrey 2002: 60\"/>\n\nImperial concubines, kept by emperors in the [[Forbidden City]], had [[ranks of imperial consorts in China|different ranks]] and were traditionally guarded by [[eunuch]]s to ensure that they could not be impregnated by anyone but the emperor.<ref name=\"Concubines of Ancient China\"/> In [[Ming dynasty|Ming China]] (1368\u20131644) there was an official system to select concubines for the emperor.

Lady Yehenara, otherwise known as [[Empress Dowager Cixi]], was arguably one of the most successful concubines in Chinese history.

In many cases, taking a concubine was akin to a marriage. Kidnapping a concubine, although common in fiction, would have been shameful, if not criminal. If the concubine was a commoner, a messenger was sent with betrothal money or a note for exemption of tax to ask for her parents' acceptance. Even though the woman would not be a legal wife, a situation normally considered a demotion, many wealthy merchants believed that being the concubine of a samurai was superior to being the legal wife of a commoner. When a merchant's daughter married a samurai, her family's money erased the samurai's debts, and the samurai's social status improved the standing of the merchant family. If a samurai's commoner concubine gave birth to a son, the son could inherit his father's social status.\n\nConcubines sometimes wielded significant influence. [[Nene (aristocrat)|Nene]], wife of Toyotomi Hideyoshi, was known to overrule her husband's decisions at times and [[Yodo-dono]], his concubine, became the ''de facto'' master of Osaka castle and the Toyotomi clan after Hideyoshi's death.\n\n===Korea===\n[[Joseon]] monarchs had a harem which contained concubines of different ranks. [[Empress Myeongseong]] managed to have sons, preventing sons of concubines getting power.\n\nChildren of concubines often had lower value in account of marriage. A daughter of concubine could not marry a wife-born son of the same class. For example, [[Jang Nok-su]] was a concubine-born daughter of a mayor, who was initially married to a slave-servant, and later became a high-ranking concubine of [[Yeonsangun]].\n\n== Vikings ==\n[[Polygyny]] was common among [[Vikings]], rich and powerful Viking men tended to have many wives and concubines.

The children of the concubine often had equal rights with those of the wife;<ref name=\"JewEncPil\" /> for example, King [[Abimelech (Judges)|Abimelech]] was the son of [[Gideon]] and his concubine.<ref>{{bibleverse||Judges|8:31|}}</ref> Later biblical figures such as Gideon, and [[Solomon]] had concubines in addition to many childbearing wives. For example, the [[Books of Kings]] say that Solomon had 700 wives and 300 concubines.<ref>{{bibleverse|1|Kings|11:1\u20133}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Fiddlerandtaborer.png|thumb|Illustration from the [[Morgan Bible]] of the [[Benjamite]]s taking women of [[Shiloh (biblical city)|Shiloh]] as concubines.]]\nThe account of the unnamed Levite in Judges 19\u201320<ref>{{bibleverse||Judges|19|NRVS}}, {{bibleverse||Judges|20|NRSV}}</ref> shows that the taking of concubines was not the exclusive preserve of kings or patriarchs in Israel during the time of the Judges, and that the rape of a concubine was completely unacceptable to the Israelite nation and led to a [[civil war]]. In the story, the Levite appears to be an ordinary member of the tribe, whose concubine was a woman from Bethlehem in Judah. This woman was unfaithful, and eventually abandoned him to return to her paternal household. However, after four months, the Levite, referred to as her husband, decided to travel to her father's house to persuade his concubine to return. She is amenable to returning with him, and the father-in-law is very welcoming. The father-in-law convinces the Levite to remain several additional days, until the party leaves behind schedule in the late evening. The group pass up a nearby non-Israelite town to arrive very late in the city of Gibeah, which is in the land of the Benjaminites. The group sit around the town square, waiting for a local to invite them in for the evening, as was the custom for travelers. A local old man invites them to stay in his home, offering them [[guest right]] by washing their feet and offering them food. A band of wicked townsmen attack the house and demand the host send out the Levite man so they can have sex with him. The host offers to send out his virgin daughter as well as the Levite's concubine for them to rape, to avoid breaking guest right towards the Levite. Eventually, to ensure his own safety and that of his host, the Levite gives the men his concubine, who is raped and abused through the night, until she is left collapsed against the front door at dawn. In the morning, the Levite finds her when he tries to leave. When she fails to respond to her husband's order to get up, most likely because she is dead, the Levite places her on his donkey and continues home. Once home, he dismembers her body and distributes the 12 parts throughout the nation of Israel. The Israelites gather to learn why they were sent such grisly gifts, and are told of the sadistic rape of his concubine by the Levite. The crime is considered outrageous by the Israelite tribesmen, who then wreak total retribution on the men of Gibeah, as well as the surrounding tribe of Benjamin when they support the Gibeans, killing them without mercy and burning all their towns. The inhabitants of (the town of) Jabesh Gilead are then slaughtered as a punishment for not joining the eleven tribes in their war against the Benjaminites, and their four hundred unmarried daughters given in [[forced marriage]] to the six hundred Benjamite survivors. Finally, the two hundred Benjaminite survivors who still have no wives are granted a [[raptio|mass marriage by abduction]] by the other tribes.\n\n====In modern Judaism====\nIn Judaism, concubines are referred to by the Hebrew term [[pilegesh]] ({{lang-he|\u05e4\u05d9\u05dc\u05d2\u05e9}}). The term is a loanword from [[Ancient Greek]] {{lang|grc|\u03c0\u03b1\u03bb\u03bb\u03b1\u03ba\u03af\u03c2}},<ref>Michael Lieb, Milton and the culture of violence, p.274, Cornell University Press, 1994</ref><ref>Agendas for the study of Midrash in the twenty-first century, Marc Lee Raphael, p.136, Dept. of Religion, College of William and Mary, 1999</ref><ref>Nicholas Clapp, Sheba: Through the Desert in Search of the Legendary Queen, p.297, Houghton Mifflin, 2002</ref> meaning \"a mistress staying in house\".\n\nAccording to the [[Talmud|Babylonian Talmud]],<ref name=\"JewEncPil\" /> the difference between a concubine and a legitimate wife was that the latter received a [[ketubah]] and [[Jewish wedding|her marriage]] (''nissu'in'') was preceded by an [[erusin]] (\"formal betrothal\"), which was not the case for a concubine.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/articles/12148-pilegesh|title=PILEGESH (Hebrew, ; comp.

Indeed, such thinkers argued that commoners may not engage in any type of [[human sexuality|sexual relations]] outside of a marriage.\n\nMaimonides was not the first Jewish thinker to criticise concubinage. For example, [[Leviticus Rabbah]] severely condemns the custom.<ref>''Leviticus Rabbah'', 25</ref> Other Jewish thinkers, such as [[Nahmanides]], [[Samuel ben Uri Shraga Phoebus]], and [[Jacob Emden]], strongly objected to the idea that concubines should be forbidden.\n\nIn the [[Modern Hebrew|Hebrew]] of the contemporary [[Israel|State of Israel]], ''pilegesh'' is often used as the equivalent of the English word \"[[Mistress (lover)|mistress]]\"\u2014i.e., the female partner in extramarital relations\u2014regardless of legal recognition. Attempts have been initiated to popularise ''pilegesh'' as a form of premarital, non-marital or extramarital relationship (which, according to the perspective of the enacting person(s), is permitted by [[Halakha|Jewish law]]).<ref>{{cite news |title=Kosher sex without marriage |url=http://www.jpost.com/Jewish-World/Jewish-Features/Kosher-sex-without-marriage |newspaper=The Jerusalem Post |date=16 March 2006 |author=Matthew Wagner |accessdate=13 June 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140503230106/http://www.jpost.com/Jewish-World/Jewish-Features/Kosher-sex-without-marriage |archive-date=3 May 2014 |url-status=live |df=dmy-all }}</ref><ref>Adam Dickter, \"ISO: Kosher Concubine\", ''New York Jewish Week'', December 2006</ref><ref>[http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-4826676.html Suzanne Glass, \"The Concubine Connection\"] {{Webarchive|url=https://archive.li/20130103033314/http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-4826676.html |date=3 January 2013 }}, ''The Independent'', London 20 October 1996</ref>\n\n===In Islam and Arab world===\n{{main|Ma malakat aymanukum}}\n{{See also|Sexual slavery in Islam}}\n{{POV section|date=August 2014}}\n[[File:V.M.

Most of the commentators assume unquestioningly that this relates to female slaves, and that the particle aw (\"or\") denotes a permissible alternative. This conventional interpretation is, in my opinion inadmissible inasmuch as it is based on the assumption that sexual intercourse with one's female slave is permitted without marriage: an assumption which is contradicted by the Qur'an itself (see\u00a04:3, {24}, {25} and\u00a024:32, with the corresponding notes). Nor is this the only objection to the above-mentioned interpretation. Since the Qur'an applies the term \"believers\" to men and women alike, and since the term azwaj (\"spouses\"), too, denotes both the male and the female partners in marriage, there is no reason for attributing to the phrase aw ma malakat aymanuhum the meaning of \"their female slaves\"; and since, on the other hand, it is out of the question that female and male slaves could have been referred to here, it is obvious that this phrase does not relate to slaves at all, but has the same meaning as in\u00a04:24- namely, \"those whom they rightfully possess through wedlock\" (see note [26] on\u00a04:24) - with the significant difference that in the present context this expression relates to both husbands and wives, who \"rightfully possess\" one another by virtue of marriage. On the basis of this interpretation, the particle aw which precedes this clause does not denote an alternative (\"or\") but is, rather, in the nature of an explanatory amplification, more or less analgous to the phrase \"in other words\" or \"that is\", thus giving to the whole sentence the meaning, \"...save with their spouses - that is, those whom they rightfully possess [through wedlock]...\", etc. (Cf. a similar construction 25:62 - \"for him who has the will to take thought - that is [lit., \"or\"], has the will to be grateful\".)\u201c}}</ref> which was not considered prostitution, and was very common during the [[Arab slave trade]] throughout the Middle Ages and [[early modern period]], when women and girls from the [[Caucasus]], [[Africa]], [[Central Asia]] and [[Europe]] were captured and served as [[concubine]]s in the [[harem]]s of the [[Arab World]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/religion/religions/islam/history/slavery_7.shtml|title=BBC \u2013 Religions \u2013 Islam: Slavery in Islam|accessdate=11 December 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090521234122/http://www.bbc.co.uk/religion/religions/islam/history/slavery_7.shtml|archive-date=21 May 2009|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}</ref> [[Ibn Battuta]] tells us several times that he was given or purchased female slaves.<ref>[http://www.sfusd.k12.ca.us/schwww/sch618/Ibn_Battuta/Slavery.html Insights into the concept of Slavery] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091122171200/http://www.sfusd.k12.ca.us/schwww/sch618/ibn_battuta/Slavery.html |date=2009-11-22 }}.

Whatever the status and rights of the concubine, they were always inferior to those of the wife, and typically neither she nor her children had rights of inheritance. [[Courtesan|Especially]] among royalty and nobility, the woman in such relationships was commonly described as a [[Mistress (lover)|mistress]]. The children of such relationships were counted as [[illegitimate]] and in some societies were barred from inheriting the father's title or estates, even in the absence of legitimate heirs.\n\n==In Asia==\nConcubinage was highly popular before the early 20th century all over [[East Asia]]. The main function of concubinage was producing additional heirs, as well as bringing males pleasure. Children of concubines had lower rights in account to inheritance, which was regulated by the [[Dishu system]].\n\n=== Mongols ===\nPolygyny and concubinage were very common in Mongol society especially for powerful Mongol men.

The standard Chinese term translated as \"concubine\" was ''qi\u00e8'' {{lang|zh|\u59be}}, a term that has been used since ancient times, which means \"concubine; I, your servant (deprecating self reference)\". Concubinage resembled marriage in that concubines were recognized sexual partners of a man and were expected to bear children for him. Unofficial concubines ({{zh|t=\u5a62\u59be|p=b\u00ec qi\u00e8}}) were of lower status, and their children were considered illegitimate. The English term concubine is also used for what the Chinese refer to as ''p\u00ednf\u0113i'' ({{zh|t=\u5b2a\u5983}}), or \"consorts of emperors\", an official position often carrying a very high rank.<ref>Patricia Buckley Ebrey (2002): ''Women and the Family in Chinese History''.

From the [[Han dynasty#Eastern Han|Eastern Han]] period (AD 25\u2013220) onward, the number of concubines a man could have was limited by law.

It became permissible to promote a concubine to wife, if the original wife had died and the concubine was the mother of the only surviving sons. Moreover, the prohibition against forcing a widow to remarry was extended to widowed concubines. During this period tablets for concubine-mothers seem to have been more commonly placed in family ancestral altars, and genealogies of some lineages listed concubine-mothers.<ref name=\"Ebrey 2002: 60\"/>\n\nImperial concubines, kept by emperors in the [[Forbidden City]], had [[ranks of imperial consorts in China|different ranks]] and were traditionally guarded by [[eunuch]]s to ensure that they could not be impregnated by anyone but the emperor.<ref name=\"Concubines of Ancient China\"/> In [[Ming dynasty|Ming China]] (1368\u20131644) there was an official system to select concubines for the emperor. The age of the candidates ranged mainly from 14 to 16.

Lady Yehenara, otherwise known as [[Empress Dowager Cixi]], was arguably one of the most successful concubines in Chinese history.

In many cases, taking a concubine was akin to a marriage. Kidnapping a concubine, although common in fiction, would have been shameful, if not criminal. If the concubine was a commoner, a messenger was sent with betrothal money or a note for exemption of tax to ask for her parents' acceptance. Even though the woman would not be a legal wife, a situation normally considered a demotion, many wealthy merchants believed that being the concubine of a samurai was superior to being the legal wife of a commoner. When a merchant's daughter married a samurai, her family's money erased the samurai's debts, and the samurai's social status improved the standing of the merchant family. If a samurai's commoner concubine gave birth to a son, the son could inherit his father's social status.\n\nConcubines sometimes wielded significant influence. [[Nene (aristocrat)|Nene]], wife of Toyotomi Hideyoshi, was known to overrule her husband's decisions at times and [[Yodo-dono]], his concubine, became the ''de facto'' master of Osaka castle and the Toyotomi clan after Hideyoshi's death.\n\n===Korea===\n[[Joseon]] monarchs had a harem which contained concubines of different ranks. [[Empress Myeongseong]] managed to have sons, preventing sons of concubines getting power.\n\nChildren of concubines often had lower value in account of marriage. A daughter of concubine could not marry a wife-born son of the same class.

A man could have many wives and concubines. Legally, any children born to a concubine were considered to be the children of the wife she was under. [[Sarah]] had to get [[Ishmael]] out of her house because legally Ishmael would always be the first born son even though [[Isaac]] was her natural child.\nThe concubine may not have commanded the exact amount of respect as the wife. In the [[Levitical]] rules on sexual relations, the Hebrew word that is commonly translated as \"wife\" is distinct from the Hebrew word that means \"concubine\". However, on at least one other occasion the term is used to refer to a woman who is not a wife{{snd}} specifically, the handmaiden of Jacob's wife.<ref>{{bibleverse||Genesis|30:4|}}</ref> In the Levitical code, sexual intercourse between a man and a wife of a different man was forbidden and punishable by death for both persons involved.<ref>{{bibleverse||Leviticus|20:10|}}</ref><ref>{{bibleverse||Deuteronomy|22:22|}}</ref> Since it was regarded as the highest blessing to have many children, wives often gave their maids to their husbands if they were barren, as in the cases of [[Sarah]] and [[Hagar (Bible)|Hagar]], and [[Rachel]] and [[Bilhah]]. The children of the concubine often had equal rights with those of the wife;<ref name=\"JewEncPil\" /> for example, King [[Abimelech (Judges)|Abimelech]] was the son of [[Gideon]] and his concubine.<ref>{{bibleverse||Judges|8:31|}}</ref> Later biblical figures such as Gideon, and [[Solomon]] had concubines in addition to many childbearing wives. For example, the [[Books of Kings]] say that Solomon had 700 wives and 300 concubines.<ref>{{bibleverse|1|Kings|11:1\u20133}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Fiddlerandtaborer.png|thumb|Illustration from the [[Morgan Bible]] of the [[Benjamite]]s taking women of [[Shiloh (biblical city)|Shiloh]] as concubines.]]\nThe account of the unnamed Levite in Judges 19\u201320<ref>{{bibleverse||Judges|19|NRVS}}, {{bibleverse||Judges|20|NRSV}}</ref> shows that the taking of concubines was not the exclusive preserve of kings or patriarchs in Israel during the time of the Judges, and that the rape of a concubine was completely unacceptable to the Israelite nation and led to a [[civil war]]. In the story, the Levite appears to be an ordinary member of the tribe, whose concubine was a woman from Bethlehem in Judah. This woman was unfaithful, and eventually abandoned him to return to her paternal household. However, after four months, the Levite, referred to as her husband, decided to travel to her father's house to persuade his concubine to return. She is amenable to returning with him, and the father-in-law is very welcoming. The father-in-law convinces the Levite to remain several additional days, until the party leaves behind schedule in the late evening. The group pass up a nearby non-Israelite town to arrive very late in the city of Gibeah, which is in the land of the Benjaminites. The group sit around the town square, waiting for a local to invite them in for the evening, as was the custom for travelers. A local old man invites them to stay in his home, offering them [[guest right]] by washing their feet and offering them food. A band of wicked townsmen attack the house and demand the host send out the Levite man so they can have sex with him. The host offers to send out his virgin daughter as well as the Levite's concubine for them to rape, to avoid breaking guest right towards the Levite. Eventually, to ensure his own safety and that of his host, the Levite gives the men his concubine, who is raped and abused through the night, until she is left collapsed against the front door at dawn. In the morning, the Levite finds her when he tries to leave. When she fails to respond to her husband's order to get up, most likely because she is dead, the Levite places her on his donkey and continues home. Once home, he dismembers her body and distributes the 12 parts throughout the nation of Israel. The Israelites gather to learn why they were sent such grisly gifts, and are told of the sadistic rape of his concubine by the Levite. The crime is considered outrageous by the Israelite tribesmen, who then wreak total retribution on the men of Gibeah, as well as the surrounding tribe of Benjamin when they support the Gibeans, killing them without mercy and burning all their towns. The inhabitants of (the town of) Jabesh Gilead are then slaughtered as a punishment for not joining the eleven tribes in their war against the Benjaminites, and their four hundred unmarried daughters given in [[forced marriage]] to the six hundred Benjamite survivors. Finally, the two hundred Benjaminite survivors who still have no wives are granted a [[raptio|mass marriage by abduction]] by the other tribes.\n\n====In modern Judaism====\nIn Judaism, concubines are referred to by the Hebrew term [[pilegesh]] ({{lang-he|\u05e4\u05d9\u05dc\u05d2\u05e9}}). The term is a loanword from [[Ancient Greek]] {{lang|grc|\u03c0\u03b1\u03bb\u03bb\u03b1\u03ba\u03af\u03c2}},<ref>Michael Lieb, Milton and the culture of violence, p.274, Cornell University Press, 1994</ref><ref>Agendas for the study of Midrash in the twenty-first century, Marc Lee Raphael, p.136, Dept. of Religion, College of William and Mary, 1999</ref><ref>Nicholas Clapp, Sheba: Through the Desert in Search of the Legendary Queen, p.297, Houghton Mifflin, 2002</ref> meaning \"a mistress staying in house\".\n\nAccording to the [[Talmud|Babylonian Talmud]],<ref name=\"JewEncPil\" /> the difference between a concubine and a legitimate wife was that the latter received a [[ketubah]] and [[Jewish wedding|her marriage]] (''nissu'in'') was preceded by an [[erusin]] (\"formal betrothal\"), which was not the case for a concubine.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/articles/12148-pilegesh|title=PILEGESH (Hebrew, ; comp.

Indeed, such thinkers argued that commoners may not engage in any type of [[human sexuality|sexual relations]] outside of a marriage.\n\nMaimonides was not the first Jewish thinker to criticise concubinage. For example, [[Leviticus Rabbah]] severely condemns the custom.<ref>''Leviticus Rabbah'', 25</ref> Other Jewish thinkers, such as [[Nahmanides]], [[Samuel ben Uri Shraga Phoebus]], and [[Jacob Emden]], strongly objected to the idea that concubines should be forbidden.\n\nIn the [[Modern Hebrew|Hebrew]] of the contemporary [[Israel|State of Israel]], ''pilegesh'' is often used as the equivalent of the English word \"[[Mistress (lover)|mistress]]\"\u2014i.e., the female partner in extramarital relations\u2014regardless of legal recognition. Attempts have been initiated to popularise ''pilegesh'' as a form of premarital, non-marital or extramarital relationship (which, according to the perspective of the enacting person(s), is permitted by [[Halakha|Jewish law]]).<ref>{{cite news |title=Kosher sex without marriage |url=http://www.jpost.com/Jewish-World/Jewish-Features/Kosher-sex-without-marriage |newspaper=The Jerusalem Post |date=16 March 2006 |author=Matthew Wagner |accessdate=13 June 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140503230106/http://www.jpost.com/Jewish-World/Jewish-Features/Kosher-sex-without-marriage |archive-date=3 May 2014 |url-status=live |df=dmy-all }}</ref><ref>Adam Dickter, \"ISO: Kosher Concubine\", ''New York Jewish Week'', December 2006</ref><ref>[http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-4826676.html Suzanne Glass, \"The Concubine Connection\"] {{Webarchive|url=https://archive.li/20130103033314/http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-4826676.html |date=3 January 2013 }}, ''The Independent'', London 20 October 1996</ref>\n\n===In Islam and Arab world===\n{{main|Ma malakat aymanukum}}\n{{See also|Sexual slavery in Islam}}\n{{POV section|date=August 2014}}\n[[File:V.M.

Most of the commentators assume unquestioningly that this relates to female slaves, and that the particle aw (\"or\") denotes a permissible alternative. This conventional interpretation is, in my opinion inadmissible inasmuch as it is based on the assumption that sexual intercourse with one's female slave is permitted without marriage: an assumption which is contradicted by the Qur'an itself (see\u00a04:3, {24}, {25} and\u00a024:32, with the corresponding notes). Nor is this the only objection to the above-mentioned interpretation. Since the Qur'an applies the term \"believers\" to men and women alike, and since the term azwaj (\"spouses\"), too, denotes both the male and the female partners in marriage, there is no reason for attributing to the phrase aw ma malakat aymanuhum the meaning of \"their female slaves\"; and since, on the other hand, it is out of the question that female and male slaves could have been referred to here, it is obvious that this phrase does not relate to slaves at all, but has the same meaning as in\u00a04:24- namely, \"those whom they rightfully possess through wedlock\" (see note [26] on\u00a04:24) - with the significant difference that in the present context this expression relates to both husbands and wives, who \"rightfully possess\" one another by virtue of marriage.

His early career, dominated by science fiction, began with short stories in 1939 and novels in 1950. This lasted until about 1958, all but ending after publication of ''[[The Naked Sun]]'' (1957). He began publishing nonfiction as co-author of a college-level textbook called ''Biochemistry and Human Metabolism''. Following the brief orbit of the first man-made satellite [[Sputnik I]] by the USSR in 1957, his production of nonfiction, particularly [[popular science]] books, greatly increased, with a consequent drop in his science fiction output. Over the next quarter century, he wrote only four science fiction novels, while writing over 120 nonfiction books. Starting in 1982, the second half of his science fiction career began with the publication of ''[[Foundation's Edge]]''. From then until his death, Asimov published several more sequels and prequels to his existing novels, tying them together in a way he had not originally anticipated, making a unified series. There are, however, many inconsistencies in this unification, especially in his earlier stories.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Asimov |first=Isaac |title=Prelude to Foundation |publisher=Bantam Books |date=1988 |pages=xiii\u2013xv |nopp=true }}</ref> [[Doubleday (publisher)|Doubleday]] and [[Houghton Mifflin]] published about 60% of his work as of 1969, Asimov stating that \"both represent a father image\".{{r|nichols19690803}}\n\nAsimov believed his most enduring contributions would be his \"[[Three Laws of Robotics]]\" and the [[Foundation Series|''Foundation'' series]].<ref>''Yours, Isaac Asimov,'' p.&nbsp;329</ref> Furthermore, the ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'' credits his science fiction for introducing into the English language the words \"[[robotics]]\", \"[[positronic brain|positronic]]\" (an entirely fictional technology), and \"[[psychohistory (fictional)|psychohistory]]\" (which is also used for a [[Psychohistory|different study]] on historical motivations). Asimov coined the term \"robotics\" without suspecting that it might be an original word; at the time, he believed it was simply the natural analogue of words such as [[mechanics]] and [[hydraulics]], but for [[robot]]s. Unlike his word \"psychohistory\", the word \"robotics\" continues in mainstream technical use with Asimov's original definition. ''[[Star Trek: The Next Generation]]'' featured [[android (robot)|androids]] with \"[[positronic brain]]s\" and the first-season episode \"[[Datalore]]\" called the positronic brain \"Asimov's dream\".<ref>{{cite web |last=Seiler |first=Edward |last2=Hatcher |first2=Richard |url=http://www.asimovonline.com/asimov_FAQ.html#series12 |title=Is Data from Star Trek: The Next Generation an Asimovian robot? |publisher=Isaac Asimov Home Page |date=2014 |accessdate=August 3, 2016}}</ref>\n\nAsimov was so prolific that his books span all major categories of the [[Dewey Decimal Classification]] except for category 100, [[philosophy]] and [[psychology]].<ref name=\"AsimovFAQ-DeweyDecimal\" /> Although Asimov did write several essays about psychology,<ref>{{cite web |last=Seiler |first=Edward |last2=Hatcher |first2=Richard |url=http://www.asimovonline.com/oldsite/Essays/psychology.html |title=Asimov essays about psychology |publisher=Isaac Asimov Home Page |date=1995 |accessdate=May 13, 2013}}</ref> and forewords for the books ''The Humanist Way'' (1988) and ''In Pursuit of Truth'' (1982),<ref name=\"Popper\" /> which were classified in the 100s category, none of his own books were classified in that category.<ref name=\"AsimovFAQ-DeweyDecimal\">{{cite web |last=Seiler |first=Edward |last2=Hatcher |first2=Richard |url=http://www.asimovonline.com/asimov_FAQ.html#others11 |title=Did you know that Asimov is the only author to have published books in all ten categories of the Dewey Decimal System? |date=2014 |accessdate=August 4, 2016}}</ref>\n\nAccording to [[UNESCO]]'s ''Index Translationum database'', Asimov is the world's 24th most-translated author.<ref>''[http://www.unesco.org/xtrans/bsstatexp.aspx?crit1L=5&nTyp=min&topN=50 Index Translationum database]''</ref>\n\n=== Science fiction ===\n{{quote|No matter how various the subject matter I write on, I was a science-fiction writer first and it is as a science-fiction writer that I want to be identified.|Asimov, 1980<ref>{{Cite book |title=In Joy Still Felt|last= Asimov |first=Isaac |publisher=Avon |year=1980 |location= New York|pages= 286-287}}</ref>}}\n\n[[File:GXY5101 0000fc.jpg|thumb|right|The first installment of Asimov's ''Tyrann'' was the cover story in the fourth issue of ''[[Galaxy Science Fiction]]'' in 1951.

In May 1937 he first thought of writing professionally, and began writing his first science fiction story, \"Cosmic Corkscrew\" (now lost), that year. On May 17, 1938, puzzled by a change in the schedule of ''[[Astounding Science Fiction]]'', Asimov visited its publisher [[Street & Smith Publications]]. Inspired by the visit, he finished the story on June 19, 1938 and personally submitted it to ''Astounding'' editor [[John W. Campbell]] two days later. Campbell met with Asimov for more than an hour and promised to read the story himself. Two days later he received a rejection letter explaining why in detail.{{r|earlyyears1_9}} This was the first of what became almost weekly meetings with the editor while Asimov lived in New York, until moving to Boston in 1949;{{r|earlyyears560_564}} Campbell had a strong formative influence on Asimov and became a personal friend.<ref>{{cite book |title=Isaac Asimov: The Foundations of Science Fiction |last=Gunn |first=James |authorlink=James Gunn (author) |date=1982 |publisher=[[Oxford University Press]] |location=[[Oxford, England]] |isbn=0-19-503059-1 |pages=[https://archive.org/details/isaacasimovfound00gunn/page/12 12\u201313, 20] |url=https://archive.org/details/isaacasimovfound00gunn/page/12 }}</ref>\n\nBy the end of the month Asimov completed a second story, \"[[The Callistan Menace|Stowaway]]\".

Starting in the 1960s, he wrote 14 popular history books, including ''The Greeks: A Great Adventure'' (1965),<ref>{{cite book |title=The Greeks: A Great Adventure |last=Asimov |first=Isaac |date=1965 |publisher=Houghton Mifflin |location=Boston}}</ref> ''The Roman Republic'' (1966),<ref>{{cite book |title=The Roman Republic |last=Asimov |first=Isaac |date=1966 |publisher=Houghton Mifflin |location=Boston}}</ref> ''The Roman Empire'' (1967),<ref>{{cite book |title=The Roman Empire |last=Asimov |first=Isaac |date=1967 |publisher=Houghton Mifflin |location=Boston}}</ref> ''The Egyptians'' (1967)<ref>{{cite book |title=The Egyptians |last=Asimov |first=Isaac |date=1967 |publisher=Houghton Mifflin |location=Boston}}</ref> ''The Near East: 10,000 Years of History'' (1968),\n<ref>{{cite book |title=The Near East: 10,000 Years of History |last=Asimov |first=Isaac |date=1968 |publisher=Houghton Mifflin |location=Boston}}</ref> and ''[[Asimov's Chronology of the World]]'' (1991).<ref>{{cite book |title=Asimov's Chronology of the World |last=Asimov |first=Isaac |date=1991 |publisher=HarperCollins |location=New York}}</ref>\n\nHe published ''[[Asimov's Guide to the Bible]]'' in two volumes\u2014covering the [[Old Testament]] in 1967 and the [[New Testament]] in 1969\u2014and then combined them into one 1,300-page volume in 1981. Complete with maps and tables, the guide goes through the books of the Bible in order, explaining the history of each one and the political influences that affected it, as well as biographical information about the important characters. His interest in literature manifested itself in several annotations of literary works, including ''[[Asimov's Guide to Shakespeare]]'' (1970),{{efn|Asimov, ''In Joy Still Felt'' (1980), pp. 464\u2013465: \"Of all the books I have ever worked on, I think ''Asimov's Guide to Shakespeare'' gave me the most pleasure, day in, day out. For months and months I lived and thought Shakespeare, and I don't see how there can be any greater pleasure in the world\u2014any pleasure, that is, that one can indulge in for as much as ten hours without pause, day after day indefinitely.\"}} ''Asimov's Annotated Paradise Lost'' (1974), and ''The Annotated Gulliver's Travels'' (1980).<ref>''I. Asimov: A Memoir'' chapter 112</ref>\n\nAsimov was also a noted mystery author and a frequent contributor to ''Ellery Queen's Mystery Magazine''. He began by writing science fiction mysteries such as his Wendell Urth stories, but soon moved on to writing \"pure\" mysteries. He published two full-length mystery novels, and wrote 66 stories about the [[Black Widowers]], a group of men who met monthly for dinner, conversation, and a puzzle. He got the idea for the Widowers from his own association in a stag group called the Trap Door Spiders and all of the main characters (with the exception of the waiter, Henry, who he admitted resembled Wodehouse's Jeeves) were modeled after his closest friends.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Asimov |first=Isaac |title=Puzzles of the Black Widowers |publisher=Bantam Books |date=1991 |pages=xiii |nopp=true }}</ref>\n\nToward the end of his life, Asimov published a series of collections of [[limerick (poetry)|limericks]], mostly written by himself, starting with ''[[Lecherous Limericks]]'', which appeared in 1975. ''Limericks: Too Gross'', whose title displays Asimov's love of [[pun]]s, contains 144 limericks by Asimov and an equal number by [[John Ciardi]]. He even created a slim volume of [[Sherlock Holmes|Sherlockian]] limericks. Asimov featured [[Yiddish]] humor in ''[[Azazel (Asimov)|Azazel, The Two Centimeter Demon]]''. The two main characters, both Jewish, talk over dinner, or lunch, or breakfast, about anecdotes of \"George\" and his friend Azazel. Asimov's ''[[Isaac Asimov's Treasury of Humor|Treasury of Humor]]'' is both a working joke book and a treatise propounding his views on [[Theory of humor|humor theory]]. According to Asimov, the most essential element of humor is an abrupt change in point of view, one that suddenly shifts focus from the important to the trivial, or from the sublime to the ridiculous.<ref name=\"Asimov 1971\">{{cite book |title=Isaac Asimov's Treasury of Humor |last=Asimov |first=Isaac |date=1971 |publisher=Houghton Mifflin |location=New York |isbn=0-395-12665-7}}</ref><ref name=\"Asimov 1992\">{{cite book|title=Asimov Laughs Again |last=Asimov |first=Isaac |date=1992 |publisher=HarperCollins |location=London |isbn=0-06-016826-9 |url=https://archive.org/details/asimovlaughsagai00isaa }}</ref>\n\nParticularly in his later years, Asimov to some extent cultivated an image of himself as an amiable lecher. In 1971, as a response to the popularity of sexual guidebooks such as ''[[The Sensuous Woman]]'' (by \"J\") and ''[[The Sensuous Man]]'' (by \"M\"), Asimov published ''[[The Sensuous Dirty Old Man]]'' under the byline \"Dr. 'A{{'\"}}<ref>''In Joy Still Felt'' p. 569</ref> (although his full name was printed on the paperback edition, first published 1972). However, by 2016, some of Asimov's behavior towards women was described as [[sexual harassment]] and cited as an example of historically problematic behavior by men in science fiction communities.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://io9.gizmodo.com/dont-look-away-fighting-sexual-harassment-in-the-scifi-1785704207|title=Don't Look Away: Fighting Sexual Harassment in the Scifi/Fantasy Community|last=Hines|first=Jim C.|date=August 29, 2016|work=io9|access-date=December 18, 2017|language=en-US}}</ref>\n\nAsimov published [[Autobiographies of Isaac Asimov|three volumes of autobiography]].

In it they offer advice on how to maintain a positive attitude and stay productive when dealing with discouragement, distractions, rejection, and thick-headed editors. The book includes many quotations, essays, anecdotes, and husband-wife dialogues about the ups and downs of being an author.<ref>{{cite book|title=How to Enjoy Writing: A Book of Aid and Comfort |last=Asimov |first=Janet |authorlink=Janet Asimov |last2=Asimov |first2=Isaac |date=1987 |publisher=Walker & Co. |location=New York |isbn=0-8027-0945-1 |url=https://archive.org/details/howtoenjoywritin00asim_0 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.asimovreviews.net/Books/Book362.html |title=How to Enjoy Writing: A Book of Aid and Comfort |publisher=John H.

Asimov wrote a critical essay on ''Star Trek''{{'}}s scientific accuracy for ''[[TV Guide]]'' magazine. Roddenberry retorted respectfully with a personal letter explaining the limitations of accuracy when writing a weekly series. Asimov corrected himself with a follow-up essay to ''TV Guide'' claiming that despite its inaccuracies, ''Star Trek'' was a fresh and intellectually challenging [[science fiction on television|science fiction television]] show. The two remained friends to the point where Asimov even served as an advisor on a number of ''Star Trek'' projects.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.lettersofnote.com/2012/06/getting-star-trek-on-air-was-impossible.html |title=Letters of Note: Getting Star Trek on the air was impossible |publisher=}}</ref>\n\n{{anchor|Calendar}}\nIn 1973, Asimov published a proposal for [[calendar reform]], called the World Season Calendar. It divides the year into four seasons (named A\u2013D) of 13 weeks (91 days) each. This allows days to be named, e.g., \"D-73\" instead of December 1 (due to December 1 being the 73rd day of the 4th quarter). An extra 'year day' is added for a total of 365 days.<ref>{{cite book |last=Asimov |first=Isaac |authorlink=Isaac Asimov |chapter=The Week Excuse |title=The Tragedy of the Moon |pages=48\u201358 |publisher=Doubleday and Co |date=1973 |isbn=0-440-18999-3|title-link=The Tragedy of the Moon }}</ref>\n\n=== Awards and recognition ===\nAsimov won more than a dozen annual awards for particular works of science fiction and a half dozen lifetime awards.<ref name=SFAwards>[http://www.locusmag.com/SFAwards/Db/NomLit5.html#179 \"Asimov, Isaac\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121016200502/http://locusmag.com/SFAwards/Db/NomLit5.html |date=October 16, 2012 }}.

(short story)|Liar!]]\" and \"[[Evidence (Asimov)|Evidence]]\"\u2014they are not stories in which character plays a significant part. Virtually all plot develops in conversation with little if any action. Nor is there a great deal of local color or description of any kind. The dialogue is, at best, functional and the style is, at best, transparent. ... . The robot stories and, as a matter of fact, almost all Asimov fiction\u2014play themselves on a relatively bare stage.<ref name=\"IASFM-Gunn\">{{cite magazine |last=Gunn |first=James | author-link = James Gunn (author) |title=On Variations on a Robot |magazine=Isaac Asimov's Science Fiction Magazine |date=July 1980 |pages=56\u201381 }}</ref>}}\n\nAsimov addressed such criticism at the beginning of ''[[Nemesis (Isaac Asimov novel)|Nemesis]]'':\n\n{{quote|I made up my mind long ago to follow one cardinal rule in all my writing\u2014to be 'clear'. I have given up all thought of writing poetically or symbolically or experimentally, or in any of the other modes that might (if I were good enough) get me a Pulitzer prize. I would write merely clearly and in this way establish a warm relationship between myself and my readers, and the professional critics\u2014Well, they can do whatever they wish.<ref name=\"Nemesis-Authour's note\">{{cite journal |last=Asimov |first=Isaac |title=Nemesis |date=October 1989 }}</ref>}}\n\nGunn cited examples of a more complex style, such as the climax of \"Liar!\". Sharply drawn characters occur at key junctures of his storylines: [[Susan Calvin]] in \"Liar!\" and \"Evidence\", [[Arkady Darell]] in ''Second Foundation'', Elijah Baley in ''[[The Caves of Steel]]'', and [[Hari Seldon]] in the ''Foundation'' prequels.\n\nOther than books by Gunn and Joseph Patrouch, a relative dearth of \"literary\" criticism exists on Asimov (particularly when compared to the sheer volume of his output). Cowart and Wymer's ''[[Dictionary of Literary Biography]]'' (1981) gives a possible reason:\n\n{{quote|His words do not easily lend themselves to traditional [[literary criticism]] because he has the habit of centering his fiction on plot and clearly stating to his reader, in rather direct terms, what is happening in his stories and why it is happening. In fact, most of the dialogue in an Asimov story, and particularly in the Foundation trilogy, is devoted to such exposition. Stories that clearly state what they mean in unambiguous language are the most difficult for a scholar to deal with because there is little to be interpreted.<ref>{{cite book |title=Dictionary of Literary Biography: Volume 8: Twentieth-Century American Science Fiction Writers |last=Cowart |first=David |last2=Wymer |first2=Thomas L. |date=1981 |publisher=Gale Research |location=Detroit |pages=15\u201329}}</ref>}}\n\nGunn's and Patrouch's respective studies of Asimov both state that a clear, direct prose style is still a style. Gunn's 1982 book comments in detail on each of Asimov's novels. He does not praise all of Asimov's fiction (nor does Patrouch), but calls some passages in ''The Caves of Steel'' \"reminiscent of [[Marcel Proust|Proust]]\". When discussing how that novel depicts night falling over futuristic New York City, Gunn says that Asimov's prose \"need not be ashamed anywhere in literary society\".<ref>{{cite book |title=Isaac Asimov: The Foundations of Science Fiction |last=Gunn |first=James |authorlink=James Gunn (author) |date=1982 |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=Oxford |isbn=0-19-503059-1 |url-access=registration |url=https://archive.org/details/isaacasimovfound00gunn }}</ref>\n\nAlthough he prided himself on his unornamented prose style (for which he credited [[Clifford D. Simak]] as an early influence{{r|earlyyears79_82}}<ref>''Beyond the Golden Age'' pp. 222\u2013223</ref>), and said in 1973 that his style had not changed,{{r|asimov1973}} Asimov also enjoyed giving his longer stories complicated [[narrative structure]]s, often by arranging chapters in non[[Chronology|chronological]] ways. Some readers have been put off by this, complaining that the [[Nonlinear (arts)|nonlinearity]] is not worth the trouble and adversely affects the clarity of the story. For example, the first third of ''The Gods Themselves'' begins with Chapter 6, then backtracks to fill in earlier material.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.asimovreviews.net/Books/Book121.html |title=Review of ''The Gods Themselves'' |accessdate=September 4, 2012 |last=Jenkins |first=John}}</ref> (John Campbell advised Asimov to begin his stories as late in the plot as possible. This advice helped Asimov create \"[[Reason (Asimov)|Reason]]\", one of the early ''Robot'' stories). Patrouch found that the interwoven and nested flashbacks of ''[[The Currents of Space]]'' did serious harm to that novel, to such an extent that only a \"dyed-in-the-[[kyrt]]<ref>Asimov, Isaac (1952), [http://www.fantasticfiction.co.uk/a/isaac-asimov/currents-of-space.htm ''The Currents of Space''], explanation of \"kyrt\"</ref> Asimov fan\" could enjoy it. In his later novel ''Nemesis'' one group of characters lives in the \"present\" and another group starts in the \"past\", beginning 15 years earlier and gradually moving toward the time period of the first group.{{citation needed|date=August 2014}}\n\n=== Limitations ===\n==== Sexuality ====\nAsimov attributed the lack of romance and sex in his fiction to the \"early imprinting\" from starting his writing career when he had never been on a date and \"didn't know anything about girls\".{{r|earlyyears25_28}} He was sometimes criticized for the general absence of sex (and of [[extraterrestrial life]]) in his science fiction. He claimed he wrote ''[[The Gods Themselves]]'' to respond to these criticisms,<ref>{{cite book |last=Asimov |first=Isaac |title=In Joy Still Felt |date=1980 |page=567}}</ref> which often came from [[New Wave science fiction]] (and often British) writers. The second part (of three) of the novel is set on an alien world with three sexes, and the sexual behavior of these creatures is extensively depicted.\n\n==== Alien life ====\nAsimov once explained that his reluctance to write about aliens came from an incident early in his career when ''Astounding''{{'}}s editor John Campbell rejected one of his science fiction stories because the alien characters were portrayed as superior to the humans. The nature of the rejection led him to believe that Campbell may have based his bias towards humans in stories on a real-world racial bias. Unwilling to write only weak alien races, and concerned that a confrontation would jeopardize his and Campbell's friendship, he decided he would not write about aliens at all.<ref name=\"Early Asimov\" /> Nevertheless, in response to these criticisms, he wrote ''[[The Gods Themselves]]'', which contains aliens and alien sex. The book won the [[Nebula Award for Best Novel]] in 1972,<ref name=\"WWE\" /> and the [[Hugo Award for Best Novel]] in 1973.<ref name=\"WWE\" /> Asimov said that of all his writings, he was most proud of the middle section of ''The Gods Themselves'', the part that deals with those themes.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Asimov |first=Isaac |title=I, Asimov: A Memoir |publisher=Doubleday |location=New York |date=1994 |page=250}}</ref>\n\nIn the [[Hugo Award]]-winning novelette \"[[Gold (Asimov short story)|Gold]]\", Asimov describes an author, clearly based on himself, who has one of his books (''The Gods Themselves'') adapted into a \"compu-drama\", essentially [[photo-realistic]] [[computer animation]]. The director criticizes the fictionalized Asimov (\"Gregory Laborian\") for having an extremely nonvisual style, making it difficult to adapt his work, and the author explains that he relies on ideas and dialogue rather than description to get his points across.<ref>{{cite book|title=Gold |last=Asimov |first=Isaac |date=1995 |publisher=HarperPrism |location=New York |isbn=0-06-105206-X |pages=[https://archive.org/details/goldfinalscience00asim/page/109 109\u2013138] |url=https://archive.org/details/goldfinalscience00asim/page/109 }}</ref>\n\n==== Portrayal of women ====\nAsimov was criticized for a lack of strong female characters in his early work. In his autobiographical writings, such as ''[[Gold (Asimov)|Gold]]'' (\"Women and Science Fiction\"), he acknowledges this and responds by pointing to inexperience. His later novels, written with more female characters but in essentially the same prose style as his early science-fiction stories, brought this matter to a wider audience. For example, the August 25, 1985 ''Washington Post''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s \"Book World\" section reports of ''Robots and Empire'' as follows:\n\n{{quote|In 1940, Asimov's humans were stripped-down masculine portraits of Americans from 1940, and they still are. His robots were tin cans with speedlines like an old [[Studebaker]], and still are; the ''Robot'' tales depended on an increasingly unworkable distinction between movable and unmovable [[artificial intelligence]]s, and still do. In the Asimov universe, because it was conceived a long time ago, and because its author abhors confusion, there are no computers whose impact is worth noting, no social complexities, no [[genetic engineering]], aliens, [[arcologies]], [[multiverses]], [[Clone (genetics)|clones]], sin or sex; his heroes (in this case [[R. Daneel Olivaw]], whom we first met as the robot protagonist of ''The Caves of Steel'' and its sequels), feel no pressure of information, raw or cooked, as the simplest of us do today; they suffer no deformation from the winds of the Asimov future, because it is so deeply and strikingly orderly.}}\n\nHowever, some of his robot stories, including the earliest ones, featured the character [[Susan Calvin]], a forceful and intelligent woman who regularly out-performed her male colleagues.<ref>Asimov (1983) ''The Complete Robot'', Grafton Books, p. 327</ref>\n\n== Views ==\n{{quote|There is a perennial question among readers as to whether the views contained in a story reflect the views of the author.

Thus, he grew up without strong religious influences, coming to believe that the ''[[Torah]]'' represented [[Jewish mythology|Hebrew mythology]] in the same way that the ''[[Iliad]]'' recorded [[Greek mythology]].<ref>{{cite book |title=I.

''In Memory Yet Green: The Autobiography of Isaac Asimov, 1920\u20131954''. Doubleday, 1979.</ref> versed in the sacred writings. This scholarship was a seed for his later authorship and publication of ''[[Asimov's Guide to the Bible]]'', an analysis of the historic foundations for both the Old and New Testaments. For many years, Asimov called himself an [[atheism|atheist]]; however, he considered the term somewhat inadequate, as it described what he did not believe rather than what he did. Eventually, he described himself as a \"[[Humanism|humanist]]\" and considered that term more practical. He did, however, continue to identify himself as a nonobservant Jew, as stated in his introduction to [[Jack Dann]]'s anthology of Jewish science fiction, ''[[Wandering Stars]]'': \"I attend no services and follow no ritual and have never undergone that curious puberty rite, the [[bar mitzvah]]. It doesn't matter. I am Jewish.\"<ref>\"I make no secret of the fact that I am a non-observant Jew\", Asimov, Isaac. ''Isaac Asimov's Science Fiction Magazine'', Volume 15, Issues 10\u201313. p. 8. Davis Publishing, 1991.</ref>\n\nWhen asked in an interview in 1982 if he was an atheist, Asimov replied,\n\n{{quote|I am an atheist, out and out. It took me a long time to say it. I've been an atheist for years and years, but somehow I felt it was intellectually unrespectable to say one was an atheist, because it assumed knowledge that one didn't have.

Asimov rejected the idea that a human belief or action could merit infinite punishment. If an afterlife existed, he claimed, the longest and most severe punishment would be reserved for those who \"slandered God by inventing Hell\".<ref>{{cite book |title=I.

He was a vocal opponent of the [[Vietnam War]] in the 1960s and in a television interview during the early 1970s he publicly endorsed [[George McGovern]].<ref>Asimov, I. ''In Joy Still Felt'' (Avon, 1981) p. 503</ref> He was unhappy about what he considered an \"irrationalist\" viewpoint taken by many radical political activists from the late 1960s and onwards. In his second volume of autobiography, ''In Joy Still Felt'', Asimov recalled meeting the counterculture figure [[Abbie Hoffman]]. Asimov's impression was that the [[Counterculture of the 1960s|1960s' counterculture]] heroes had ridden an emotional wave which, in the end, left them stranded in a \"no-man's land of the spirit\" from which he wondered if they would ever return.<ref name=\"joy\">{{cite book|title=In Joy Still Felt: The Autobiography of Isaac Asimov, 1954\u20131978 |last=Asimov |first=Isaac |date=1980 |publisher=Doubleday |location=Garden City, NY|isbn=0-385-15544-1 |page=[https://archive.org/details/injoystillfelt00isaa/page/574 574] |url=https://archive.org/details/injoystillfelt00isaa/page/574 }}</ref>\n\nAsimov vehemently opposed [[Richard Nixon]], considering him \"a crook and a liar\". He closely followed [[Watergate]], and was pleased when the president was forced to resign.

In his first autobiography, he indicates his support for the safety of Israel, though insisting that he was not a [[Zionist]].<ref>{{cite book |last=Asimov |first=Isaac |title=In Memory Yet Green |quote=<!--None-->}}</ref> In his third autobiography, Asimov stated his opposition to the creation of a Jewish state, on the grounds that he was opposed to the concept of nation-states in general, and supported the notion of a single humanity. Asimov especially worried about the safety of Israel given that it had been created among hostile neighbors, and said that Jews had merely created for themselves another \"Jewish ghetto\".{{efn|{{cite journal |last=Asimov |first=Isaac |title=I, Asimov: A Memoir |publisher=Doubleday |location=New York |date=1994 |page=380 |quote=When Israel was founded in 1948 and all my Jewish friends were jubilant, I was the skeleton at the feast.

''Yours, Isaac Asimov'', edited by Stanley Asimov. {{ISBN|0-385-47624-8}}.</ref> he states that although he would prefer living in \"no danger whatsoever\" than near a nuclear reactor, he would still prefer a home near a nuclear power plant than in a slum on [[Love Canal]] or near \"a [[Union Carbide]] plant producing [[methyl isocyanate]]\", the latter being a reference to the [[Bhopal disaster]].<ref name=\"YIA\"/>\n\nIn the closing years of his life, Asimov blamed the deterioration of the quality of life that he perceived in New York City on the shrinking tax base caused by the [[white flight|middle-class flight]] to the suburbs, though he continued to support high taxes on the middle class to pay for social programs. His last nonfiction book, ''[[Our Angry Earth]]'' (1991, co-written with his long-time friend, science fiction author [[Frederik Pohl]]), deals with elements of the environmental crisis such as [[human overpopulation|overpopulation]], [[oil dependence]], [[war]], [[global warming]], and the destruction of the [[ozone layer]].<ref>{{cite book |title=Our Angry Earth |last=Asimov |first=Isaac |last2=Pohl |first2=Frederik |date=1991 |publisher=Tor |location=New York |isbn=0-312-85252-5 |url-access=registration |url=https://archive.org/details/ourangryearth0000asim }}</ref><ref>{{cite magazine |last=Chow |first=Dan |date=December 1991 |title=Review: Our Angry Earth |magazine=Locus |location=Oakland |publisher=Locus Publications}}</ref> In response to being presented by [[Bill Moyers]] with the question \"What do you see happening to the idea of dignity to human species if this population growth continues at its present rate?\", Asimov responded:\n\n{{quote|It's going to destroy it all ... if you have 20 people in the apartment and two bathrooms, no matter how much every person believes in freedom of the bathroom, there is no such thing.

I think science fiction isn't really science fiction if it lacks science. And I think the better and truer the science, the better and truer the science fiction\".{{r|asimov196708}}\n\nThe feelings of friendship and respect between Asimov and [[Arthur C. Clarke]] were demonstrated by the so-called \"Clarke-Asimov Treaty of [[Park Avenue]]\", negotiated as they shared a cab in New York. This stated that Asimov was required to insist that Clarke was the best science fiction writer in the world (reserving second-best for himself), while Clarke was required to insist that Asimov was the best science writer in the world (reserving second-best for himself). Thus, the dedication in Clarke's book ''Report on Planet Three'' (1972) reads: \"In accordance with the terms of the Clarke-Asimov treaty, the second-best science writer dedicates this book to the second-best science-fiction writer.\"\n\nAsimov became a fan of mystery stories at the same time as science fiction. He preferred to read the former to latter because \"I read every [science fiction] story keenly aware that it might be worse than mine, in which case I had no patience with it, or that it might be better, in which case I felt miserable\".{{r|asimov1973}} Asimov wrote \"I make no secret of the fact that in my mysteries I use [[Agatha Christie]] as my model.

Why should I not use as my model what I consider the best?\"<ref>''I.

The Galactic Empire novels are set in earlier history of the same fictional universe as the Foundation series. Later, with ''[[Foundation and Earth]]'' (1986), he linked this distant future to the Robot stories, creating a unified \"[[future history]]\" for his stories much like those pioneered by Robert A.

His early career, dominated by science fiction, began with short stories in 1939 and novels in 1950. This lasted until about 1958, all but ending after publication of ''[[The Naked Sun]]'' (1957). He began publishing nonfiction as co-author of a college-level textbook called ''Biochemistry and Human Metabolism''. Following the brief orbit of the first man-made satellite [[Sputnik I]] by the USSR in 1957, his production of nonfiction, particularly [[popular science]] books, greatly increased, with a consequent drop in his science fiction output. Over the next quarter century, he wrote only four science fiction novels, while writing over 120 nonfiction books. Starting in 1982, the second half of his science fiction career began with the publication of ''[[Foundation's Edge]]''. From then until his death, Asimov published several more sequels and prequels to his existing novels, tying them together in a way he had not originally anticipated, making a unified series. There are, however, many inconsistencies in this unification, especially in his earlier stories.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Asimov |first=Isaac |title=Prelude to Foundation |publisher=Bantam Books |date=1988 |pages=xiii\u2013xv |nopp=true }}</ref> [[Doubleday (publisher)|Doubleday]] and [[Houghton Mifflin]] published about 60% of his work as of 1969, Asimov stating that \"both represent a father image\".{{r|nichols19690803}}\n\nAsimov believed his most enduring contributions would be his \"[[Three Laws of Robotics]]\" and the [[Foundation Series|''Foundation'' series]].<ref>''Yours, Isaac Asimov,'' p.&nbsp;329</ref> Furthermore, the ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'' credits his science fiction for introducing into the English language the words \"[[robotics]]\", \"[[positronic brain|positronic]]\" (an entirely fictional technology), and \"[[psychohistory (fictional)|psychohistory]]\" (which is also used for a [[Psychohistory|different study]] on historical motivations). Asimov coined the term \"robotics\" without suspecting that it might be an original word; at the time, he believed it was simply the natural analogue of words such as [[mechanics]] and [[hydraulics]], but for [[robot]]s. Unlike his word \"psychohistory\", the word \"robotics\" continues in mainstream technical use with Asimov's original definition. ''[[Star Trek: The Next Generation]]'' featured [[android (robot)|androids]] with \"[[positronic brain]]s\" and the first-season episode \"[[Datalore]]\" called the positronic brain \"Asimov's dream\".<ref>{{cite web |last=Seiler |first=Edward |last2=Hatcher |first2=Richard |url=http://www.asimovonline.com/asimov_FAQ.html#series12 |title=Is Data from Star Trek: The Next Generation an Asimovian robot? |publisher=Isaac Asimov Home Page |date=2014 |accessdate=August 3, 2016}}</ref>\n\nAsimov was so prolific that his books span all major categories of the [[Dewey Decimal Classification]] except for category 100, [[philosophy]] and [[psychology]].<ref name=\"AsimovFAQ-DeweyDecimal\" /> Although Asimov did write several essays about psychology,<ref>{{cite web |last=Seiler |first=Edward |last2=Hatcher |first2=Richard |url=http://www.asimovonline.com/oldsite/Essays/psychology.html |title=Asimov essays about psychology |publisher=Isaac Asimov Home Page |date=1995 |accessdate=May 13, 2013}}</ref> and forewords for the books ''The Humanist Way'' (1988) and ''In Pursuit of Truth'' (1982),<ref name=\"Popper\" /> which were classified in the 100s category, none of his own books were classified in that category.<ref name=\"AsimovFAQ-DeweyDecimal\">{{cite web |last=Seiler |first=Edward |last2=Hatcher |first2=Richard |url=http://www.asimovonline.com/asimov_FAQ.html#others11 |title=Did you know that Asimov is the only author to have published books in all ten categories of the Dewey Decimal System? |date=2014 |accessdate=August 4, 2016}}</ref>\n\nAccording to [[UNESCO]]'s ''Index Translationum database'', Asimov is the world's 24th most-translated author.<ref>''[http://www.unesco.org/xtrans/bsstatexp.aspx?crit1L=5&nTyp=min&topN=50 Index Translationum database]''</ref>\n\n=== Science fiction ===\n{{quote|No matter how various the subject matter I write on, I was a science-fiction writer first and it is as a science-fiction writer that I want to be identified.|Asimov, 1980<ref>{{Cite book |title=In Joy Still Felt|last= Asimov |first=Isaac |publisher=Avon |year=1980 |location= New York|pages= 286-287}}</ref>}}\n\n[[File:GXY5101 0000fc.jpg|thumb|right|The first installment of Asimov's ''Tyrann'' was the cover story in the fourth issue of ''[[Galaxy Science Fiction]]'' in 1951.

In May 1937 he first thought of writing professionally, and began writing his first science fiction story, \"Cosmic Corkscrew\" (now lost), that year. On May 17, 1938, puzzled by a change in the schedule of ''[[Astounding Science Fiction]]'', Asimov visited its publisher [[Street & Smith Publications]]. Inspired by the visit, he finished the story on June 19, 1938 and personally submitted it to ''Astounding'' editor [[John W. Campbell]] two days later. Campbell met with Asimov for more than an hour and promised to read the story himself. Two days later he received a rejection letter explaining why in detail.{{r|earlyyears1_9}} This was the first of what became almost weekly meetings with the editor while Asimov lived in New York, until moving to Boston in 1949;{{r|earlyyears560_564}} Campbell had a strong formative influence on Asimov and became a personal friend.<ref>{{cite book |title=Isaac Asimov: The Foundations of Science Fiction |last=Gunn |first=James |authorlink=James Gunn (author) |date=1982 |publisher=[[Oxford University Press]] |location=[[Oxford, England]] |isbn=0-19-503059-1 |pages=[https://archive.org/details/isaacasimovfound00gunn/page/12 12\u201313, 20] |url=https://archive.org/details/isaacasimovfound00gunn/page/12 }}</ref>\n\nBy the end of the month Asimov completed a second story, \"[[The Callistan Menace|Stowaway]]\".

Asimov notes in his introduction to the short story collection ''[[The Complete Robot]]'' (1982) that he was largely inspired by the almost relentless tendency of robots up to that time to fall consistently into a [[Frankenstein]] plot in which they destroyed their creators.\n\nThe robot series has led to film adaptations. With Asimov's collaboration, in about 1977, [[Harlan Ellison]] wrote a screenplay of ''I, Robot'' that Asimov hoped would lead to \"the first really adult, complex, worthwhile [[science fiction film]] ever made\". The screenplay has never been filmed and was eventually published in book form in 1994.

Complete with maps and tables, the guide goes through the books of the Bible in order, explaining the history of each one and the political influences that affected it, as well as biographical information about the important characters.

He began by writing science fiction mysteries such as his Wendell Urth stories, but soon moved on to writing \"pure\" mysteries. He published two full-length mystery novels, and wrote 66 stories about the [[Black Widowers]], a group of men who met monthly for dinner, conversation, and a puzzle. He got the idea for the Widowers from his own association in a stag group called the Trap Door Spiders and all of the main characters (with the exception of the waiter, Henry, who he admitted resembled Wodehouse's Jeeves) were modeled after his closest friends.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Asimov |first=Isaac |title=Puzzles of the Black Widowers |publisher=Bantam Books |date=1991 |pages=xiii |nopp=true }}</ref>\n\nToward the end of his life, Asimov published a series of collections of [[limerick (poetry)|limericks]], mostly written by himself, starting with ''[[Lecherous Limericks]]'', which appeared in 1975. ''Limericks: Too Gross'', whose title displays Asimov's love of [[pun]]s, contains 144 limericks by Asimov and an equal number by [[John Ciardi]]. He even created a slim volume of [[Sherlock Holmes|Sherlockian]] limericks. Asimov featured [[Yiddish]] humor in ''[[Azazel (Asimov)|Azazel, The Two Centimeter Demon]]''. The two main characters, both Jewish, talk over dinner, or lunch, or breakfast, about anecdotes of \"George\" and his friend Azazel. Asimov's ''[[Isaac Asimov's Treasury of Humor|Treasury of Humor]]'' is both a working joke book and a treatise propounding his views on [[Theory of humor|humor theory]].

Asimov wrote a critical essay on ''Star Trek''{{'}}s scientific accuracy for ''[[TV Guide]]'' magazine. Roddenberry retorted respectfully with a personal letter explaining the limitations of accuracy when writing a weekly series. Asimov corrected himself with a follow-up essay to ''TV Guide'' claiming that despite its inaccuracies, ''Star Trek'' was a fresh and intellectually challenging [[science fiction on television|science fiction television]] show. The two remained friends to the point where Asimov even served as an advisor on a number of ''Star Trek'' projects.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.lettersofnote.com/2012/06/getting-star-trek-on-air-was-impossible.html |title=Letters of Note: Getting Star Trek on the air was impossible |publisher=}}</ref>\n\n{{anchor|Calendar}}\nIn 1973, Asimov published a proposal for [[calendar reform]], called the World Season Calendar.

(Asimov only used an [[outline (list)|outline]] once, later describing it as \"like trying to play the piano from inside a straitjacket\".) After correcting the draft by hand, he retyped the document as the final copy and only made one revision with minor editor-requested changes; a [[word processor]] did not save him much time, Asimov said, because 95% of the first draft was unchanged.{{r|asimov1973}}<ref name=\"earlyyears142_145\"/><ref name=\"fallows198207\">{{Cite magazine |last=Fallows |first=James |date=July 1982 |title=Living With a Computer |url=https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/1982/07/living-with-a-computer/306063/ |magazine=The Atlantic |language=en-US |access-date=March 17, 2019}}</ref>\n\nAfter disliking making multiple revisions of \"[[Black Friar of the Flame]]\", Asimov refused to make major, second, or non-editorial revisions (\"like chewing used gum\"), stating that \"too large a revision, or too many revisions, indicate that the piece of writing is a failure. In the time it would take to salvage such a failure, I could write a new piece altogether and have infinitely more fun in the process\". He submitted \"failures\" to another editor.{{r|asimov1973}}<ref name=\"earlyyears142_145\">{{Cite book |url=https://archive.org/stream/earlyasimovorele00asim#page/142/mode/2up |title=The Early Asimov; or, Eleven Years of Trying |last=Asimov |first=Isaac |publisher=Doubleday |year=1972 |location=Garden City, NY |pages=142\u2013145}}</ref>\n\nOne of the most common impressions of Asimov's fiction work is that his writing style is extremely unornamented. In 1980, science fiction scholar [[James Gunn (author)|James Gunn]], professor [[emeritus]] of [[English studies|English]] at the [[University of Kansas]] wrote of ''I, Robot'':\n\n{{quote|Except for two stories\u2014\"[[Liar! (short story)|Liar!]]\" and \"[[Evidence (Asimov)|Evidence]]\"\u2014they are not stories in which character plays a significant part. Virtually all plot develops in conversation with little if any action. Nor is there a great deal of local color or description of any kind. The dialogue is, at best, functional and the style is, at best, transparent. ... . The robot stories and, as a matter of fact, almost all Asimov fiction\u2014play themselves on a relatively bare stage.<ref name=\"IASFM-Gunn\">{{cite magazine |last=Gunn |first=James | author-link = James Gunn (author) |title=On Variations on a Robot |magazine=Isaac Asimov's Science Fiction Magazine |date=July 1980 |pages=56\u201381 }}</ref>}}\n\nAsimov addressed such criticism at the beginning of ''[[Nemesis (Isaac Asimov novel)|Nemesis]]'':\n\n{{quote|I made up my mind long ago to follow one cardinal rule in all my writing\u2014to be 'clear'. I have given up all thought of writing poetically or symbolically or experimentally, or in any of the other modes that might (if I were good enough) get me a Pulitzer prize. I would write merely clearly and in this way establish a warm relationship between myself and my readers, and the professional critics\u2014Well, they can do whatever they wish.<ref name=\"Nemesis-Authour's note\">{{cite journal |last=Asimov |first=Isaac |title=Nemesis |date=October 1989 }}</ref>}}\n\nGunn cited examples of a more complex style, such as the climax of \"Liar!\". Sharply drawn characters occur at key junctures of his storylines: [[Susan Calvin]] in \"Liar!\" and \"Evidence\", [[Arkady Darell]] in ''Second Foundation'', Elijah Baley in ''[[The Caves of Steel]]'', and [[Hari Seldon]] in the ''Foundation'' prequels.\n\nOther than books by Gunn and Joseph Patrouch, a relative dearth of \"literary\" criticism exists on Asimov (particularly when compared to the sheer volume of his output). Cowart and Wymer's ''[[Dictionary of Literary Biography]]'' (1981) gives a possible reason:\n\n{{quote|His words do not easily lend themselves to traditional [[literary criticism]] because he has the habit of centering his fiction on plot and clearly stating to his reader, in rather direct terms, what is happening in his stories and why it is happening. In fact, most of the dialogue in an Asimov story, and particularly in the Foundation trilogy, is devoted to such exposition. Stories that clearly state what they mean in unambiguous language are the most difficult for a scholar to deal with because there is little to be interpreted.<ref>{{cite book |title=Dictionary of Literary Biography: Volume 8: Twentieth-Century American Science Fiction Writers |last=Cowart |first=David |last2=Wymer |first2=Thomas L. |date=1981 |publisher=Gale Research |location=Detroit |pages=15\u201329}}</ref>}}\n\nGunn's and Patrouch's respective studies of Asimov both state that a clear, direct prose style is still a style. Gunn's 1982 book comments in detail on each of Asimov's novels. He does not praise all of Asimov's fiction (nor does Patrouch), but calls some passages in ''The Caves of Steel'' \"reminiscent of [[Marcel Proust|Proust]]\". When discussing how that novel depicts night falling over futuristic New York City, Gunn says that Asimov's prose \"need not be ashamed anywhere in literary society\".<ref>{{cite book |title=Isaac Asimov: The Foundations of Science Fiction |last=Gunn |first=James |authorlink=James Gunn (author) |date=1982 |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=Oxford |isbn=0-19-503059-1 |url-access=registration |url=https://archive.org/details/isaacasimovfound00gunn }}</ref>\n\nAlthough he prided himself on his unornamented prose style (for which he credited [[Clifford D. Simak]] as an early influence{{r|earlyyears79_82}}<ref>''Beyond the Golden Age'' pp. 222\u2013223</ref>), and said in 1973 that his style had not changed,{{r|asimov1973}} Asimov also enjoyed giving his longer stories complicated [[narrative structure]]s, often by arranging chapters in non[[Chronology|chronological]] ways. Some readers have been put off by this, complaining that the [[Nonlinear (arts)|nonlinearity]] is not worth the trouble and adversely affects the clarity of the story. For example, the first third of ''The Gods Themselves'' begins with Chapter 6, then backtracks to fill in earlier material.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.asimovreviews.net/Books/Book121.html |title=Review of ''The Gods Themselves'' |accessdate=September 4, 2012 |last=Jenkins |first=John}}</ref> (John Campbell advised Asimov to begin his stories as late in the plot as possible. This advice helped Asimov create \"[[Reason (Asimov)|Reason]]\", one of the early ''Robot'' stories).

In his later novel ''Nemesis'' one group of characters lives in the \"present\" and another group starts in the \"past\", beginning 15 years earlier and gradually moving toward the time period of the first group.{{citation needed|date=August 2014}}\n\n=== Limitations ===\n==== Sexuality ====\nAsimov attributed the lack of romance and sex in his fiction to the \"early imprinting\" from starting his writing career when he had never been on a date and \"didn't know anything about girls\".{{r|earlyyears25_28}} He was sometimes criticized for the general absence of sex (and of [[extraterrestrial life]]) in his science fiction. He claimed he wrote ''[[The Gods Themselves]]'' to respond to these criticisms,<ref>{{cite book |last=Asimov |first=Isaac |title=In Joy Still Felt |date=1980 |page=567}}</ref> which often came from [[New Wave science fiction]] (and often British) writers. The second part (of three) of the novel is set on an alien world with three sexes, and the sexual behavior of these creatures is extensively depicted.\n\n==== Alien life ====\nAsimov once explained that his reluctance to write about aliens came from an incident early in his career when ''Astounding''{{'}}s editor John Campbell rejected one of his science fiction stories because the alien characters were portrayed as superior to the humans. The nature of the rejection led him to believe that Campbell may have based his bias towards humans in stories on a real-world racial bias. Unwilling to write only weak alien races, and concerned that a confrontation would jeopardize his and Campbell's friendship, he decided he would not write about aliens at all.<ref name=\"Early Asimov\" /> Nevertheless, in response to these criticisms, he wrote ''[[The Gods Themselves]]'', which contains aliens and alien sex. The book won the [[Nebula Award for Best Novel]] in 1972,<ref name=\"WWE\" /> and the [[Hugo Award for Best Novel]] in 1973.<ref name=\"WWE\" /> Asimov said that of all his writings, he was most proud of the middle section of ''The Gods Themselves'', the part that deals with those themes.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Asimov |first=Isaac |title=I, Asimov: A Memoir |publisher=Doubleday |location=New York |date=1994 |page=250}}</ref>\n\nIn the [[Hugo Award]]-winning novelette \"[[Gold (Asimov short story)|Gold]]\", Asimov describes an author, clearly based on himself, who has one of his books (''The Gods Themselves'') adapted into a \"compu-drama\", essentially [[photo-realistic]] [[computer animation]]. The director criticizes the fictionalized Asimov (\"Gregory Laborian\") for having an extremely nonvisual style, making it difficult to adapt his work, and the author explains that he relies on ideas and dialogue rather than description to get his points across.<ref>{{cite book|title=Gold |last=Asimov |first=Isaac |date=1995 |publisher=HarperPrism |location=New York |isbn=0-06-105206-X |pages=[https://archive.org/details/goldfinalscience00asim/page/109 109\u2013138] |url=https://archive.org/details/goldfinalscience00asim/page/109 }}</ref>\n\n==== Portrayal of women ====\nAsimov was criticized for a lack of strong female characters in his early work. In his autobiographical writings, such as ''[[Gold (Asimov)|Gold]]'' (\"Women and Science Fiction\"), he acknowledges this and responds by pointing to inexperience. His later novels, written with more female characters but in essentially the same prose style as his early science-fiction stories, brought this matter to a wider audience. For example, the August 25, 1985 ''Washington Post''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s \"Book World\" section reports of ''Robots and Empire'' as follows:\n\n{{quote|In 1940, Asimov's humans were stripped-down masculine portraits of Americans from 1940, and they still are. His robots were tin cans with speedlines like an old [[Studebaker]], and still are; the ''Robot'' tales depended on an increasingly unworkable distinction between movable and unmovable [[artificial intelligence]]s, and still do. In the Asimov universe, because it was conceived a long time ago, and because its author abhors confusion, there are no computers whose impact is worth noting, no social complexities, no [[genetic engineering]], aliens, [[arcologies]], [[multiverses]], [[Clone (genetics)|clones]], sin or sex; his heroes (in this case [[R. Daneel Olivaw]], whom we first met as the robot protagonist of ''The Caves of Steel'' and its sequels), feel no pressure of information, raw or cooked, as the simplest of us do today; they suffer no deformation from the winds of the Asimov future, because it is so deeply and strikingly orderly.}}\n\nHowever, some of his robot stories, including the earliest ones, featured the character [[Susan Calvin]], a forceful and intelligent woman who regularly out-performed her male colleagues.<ref>Asimov (1983) ''The Complete Robot'', Grafton Books, p. 327</ref>\n\n== Views ==\n{{quote|There is a perennial question among readers as to whether the views contained in a story reflect the views of the author.

Thus, he grew up without strong religious influences, coming to believe that the ''[[Torah]]'' represented [[Jewish mythology|Hebrew mythology]] in the same way that the ''[[Iliad]]'' recorded [[Greek mythology]].<ref>{{cite book |title=I.

This scholarship was a seed for his later authorship and publication of ''[[Asimov's Guide to the Bible]]'', an analysis of the historic foundations for both the Old and New Testaments. For many years, Asimov called himself an [[atheism|atheist]]; however, he considered the term somewhat inadequate, as it described what he did not believe rather than what he did. Eventually, he described himself as a \"[[Humanism|humanist]]\" and considered that term more practical. He did, however, continue to identify himself as a nonobservant Jew, as stated in his introduction to [[Jack Dann]]'s anthology of Jewish science fiction, ''[[Wandering Stars]]'': \"I attend no services and follow no ritual and have never undergone that curious puberty rite, the [[bar mitzvah]]. It doesn't matter. I am Jewish.\"<ref>\"I make no secret of the fact that I am a non-observant Jew\", Asimov, Isaac. ''Isaac Asimov's Science Fiction Magazine'', Volume 15, Issues 10\u201313. p. 8.

I've been an atheist for years and years, but somehow I felt it was intellectually unrespectable to say one was an atheist, because it assumed knowledge that one didn't have.

Asimov rejected the idea that a human belief or action could merit infinite punishment. If an afterlife existed, he claimed, the longest and most severe punishment would be reserved for those who \"slandered God by inventing Hell\".<ref>{{cite book |title=I.

He was a vocal opponent of the [[Vietnam War]] in the 1960s and in a television interview during the early 1970s he publicly endorsed [[George McGovern]].<ref>Asimov, I. ''In Joy Still Felt'' (Avon, 1981) p. 503</ref> He was unhappy about what he considered an \"irrationalist\" viewpoint taken by many radical political activists from the late 1960s and onwards. In his second volume of autobiography, ''In Joy Still Felt'', Asimov recalled meeting the counterculture figure [[Abbie Hoffman]]. Asimov's impression was that the [[Counterculture of the 1960s|1960s' counterculture]] heroes had ridden an emotional wave which, in the end, left them stranded in a \"no-man's land of the spirit\" from which he wondered if they would ever return.<ref name=\"joy\">{{cite book|title=In Joy Still Felt: The Autobiography of Isaac Asimov, 1954\u20131978 |last=Asimov |first=Isaac |date=1980 |publisher=Doubleday |location=Garden City, NY|isbn=0-385-15544-1 |page=[https://archive.org/details/injoystillfelt00isaa/page/574 574] |url=https://archive.org/details/injoystillfelt00isaa/page/574 }}</ref>\n\nAsimov vehemently opposed [[Richard Nixon]], considering him \"a crook and a liar\". He closely followed [[Watergate]], and was pleased when the president was forced to resign.

In his first autobiography, he indicates his support for the safety of Israel, though insisting that he was not a [[Zionist]].<ref>{{cite book |last=Asimov |first=Isaac |title=In Memory Yet Green |quote=<!--None-->}}</ref> In his third autobiography, Asimov stated his opposition to the creation of a Jewish state, on the grounds that he was opposed to the concept of nation-states in general, and supported the notion of a single humanity. Asimov especially worried about the safety of Israel given that it had been created among hostile neighbors, and said that Jews had merely created for themselves another \"Jewish ghetto\".{{efn|{{cite journal |last=Asimov |first=Isaac |title=I, Asimov: A Memoir |publisher=Doubleday |location=New York |date=1994 |page=380 |quote=When Israel was founded in 1948 and all my Jewish friends were jubilant, I was the skeleton at the feast.

''Yours, Isaac Asimov'', edited by Stanley Asimov. {{ISBN|0-385-47624-8}}.</ref> he states that although he would prefer living in \"no danger whatsoever\" than near a nuclear reactor, he would still prefer a home near a nuclear power plant than in a slum on [[Love Canal]] or near \"a [[Union Carbide]] plant producing [[methyl isocyanate]]\", the latter being a reference to the [[Bhopal disaster]].<ref name=\"YIA\"/>\n\nIn the closing years of his life, Asimov blamed the deterioration of the quality of life that he perceived in New York City on the shrinking tax base caused by the [[white flight|middle-class flight]] to the suburbs, though he continued to support high taxes on the middle class to pay for social programs. His last nonfiction book, ''[[Our Angry Earth]]'' (1991, co-written with his long-time friend, science fiction author [[Frederik Pohl]]), deals with elements of the environmental crisis such as [[human overpopulation|overpopulation]], [[oil dependence]], [[war]], [[global warming]], and the destruction of the [[ozone layer]].<ref>{{cite book |title=Our Angry Earth |last=Asimov |first=Isaac |last2=Pohl |first2=Frederik |date=1991 |publisher=Tor |location=New York |isbn=0-312-85252-5 |url-access=registration |url=https://archive.org/details/ourangryearth0000asim }}</ref><ref>{{cite magazine |last=Chow |first=Dan |date=December 1991 |title=Review: Our Angry Earth |magazine=Locus |location=Oakland |publisher=Locus Publications}}</ref> In response to being presented by [[Bill Moyers]] with the question \"What do you see happening to the idea of dignity to human species if this population growth continues at its present rate?\", Asimov responded:\n\n{{quote|It's going to destroy it all ... if you have 20 people in the apartment and two bathrooms, no matter how much every person believes in freedom of the bathroom, there is no such thing.

I think science fiction isn't really science fiction if it lacks science. And I think the better and truer the science, the better and truer the science fiction\".{{r|asimov196708}}\n\nThe feelings of friendship and respect between Asimov and [[Arthur C. Clarke]] were demonstrated by the so-called \"Clarke-Asimov Treaty of [[Park Avenue]]\", negotiated as they shared a cab in New York. This stated that Asimov was required to insist that Clarke was the best science fiction writer in the world (reserving second-best for himself), while Clarke was required to insist that Asimov was the best science writer in the world (reserving second-best for himself). Thus, the dedication in Clarke's book ''Report on Planet Three'' (1972) reads: \"In accordance with the terms of the Clarke-Asimov treaty, the second-best science writer dedicates this book to the second-best science-fiction writer.\"\n\nAsimov became a fan of mystery stories at the same time as science fiction. He preferred to read the former to latter because \"I read every [science fiction] story keenly aware that it might be worse than mine, in which case I had no patience with it, or that it might be better, in which case I felt miserable\".{{r|asimov1973}} Asimov wrote \"I make no secret of the fact that in my mysteries I use [[Agatha Christie]] as my model.

He has played most of his career as a [[Midfielder#Winger|winger]], where he operates predominantly on the left-hand side, though he can play on the right and go inside on to his stronger left foot. Downing has played more recently as an [[attacking midfielder]].\n\nDowning started his career at Middlesbrough, where after a loan at [[Sunderland A.F.C.|Sunderland]], he became a key part of the team, winning the [[EFL Cup|League Cup]] in [[2004 Football League Cup Final|2004]] and helping them to the [[2006 UEFA Cup Final|UEFA Cup final]] two years later. In 2009, after Boro's relegation, he joined [[Aston Villa F.C.|Aston Villa]] for an initial \u00a310 million, then moved on to [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]] for twice that amount two years later, again winning the League Cup in 2012. He played for two seasons at [[West Ham United F.C.|West Ham United]] before returning to Middlesbrough.

While controversial, the beliefs were to have a major impact on his son Emanuel's spirituality.

This also came to have a strong impact on Emanuel.<ref name=\"Ugglan\"/><ref name=enc1911/><ref>Martin Lamm (1978 [1915]; pp.1\u201319) notes how all Swedenborg biographies at that draw similarities between the beliefs of Jesper and Emanuel.

Swedenborg completed his university course at [[Uppsala]] in 1709, and in 1710, he made his [[grand tour]] through the Netherlands, France and Germany before reaching London, where he would spend the next four years. It was also a flourishing centre of scientific ideas and discoveries. Swedenborg studied [[physics]], [[mechanics]] and [[philosophy]] and read and wrote [[poetry]]. According to the preface of a book by the Swedish critic [[Olof Lagercrantz]], Swedenborg wrote to his benefactor and brother-in-law Benzelius that he believed that Swedenborg might be destined to be a great scientist.<ref>Lagercrantz, preface.</ref><ref name=Delblanc>x</ref>\n\n== Scientific period ==\n[[File:Swdbg2.jpg|frame|[[Swedenborg 1714 Flying Machine|The Flying Machine]], sketched in his notebook from 1714.

A first step was his meeting with King [[Charles XII of Sweden]] in the city of [[Lund]], in 1716. The Swedish inventor [[Christopher Polhem]], who became a close friend of Swedenborg, was also present. Swedenborg's purpose was to persuade the king to fund an [[observatory]] in northern Sweden. However, the warlike king did not consider this project important enough, but did appoint Swedenborg to be assessor-extraordinary on the [[Swedish Board of Mines]] (''Bergskollegium'') in [[Stockholm]].<ref>The meeting between the King, Polhelm and Swedenborg is described in detail in Liljegren, Bengt, ''Karl XII i Lund : n\u00e4r Sverige styrdes fr\u00e5n Sk\u00e5ne'', (Historiska media, Lund, 1999). {{ISBN|91-88930-51-3}}.</ref>\n\nFrom 1716 to 1718, Swedenborg published a scientific periodical entitled ''Daedalus Hyperboreus'' (''\"The Northern [[Daedalus]]\"''), a record of mechanical and mathematical inventions and discoveries. One notable description was that of [[Swedenborg 1714 Flying Machine|a flying machine]], the same he had been sketching a few years earlier.<ref name=\"Delblanc\" />\n\nIn 1718, Swedenborg published an article that attempted to explain spiritual and mental events in terms of minute vibrations, or \"tremulations\".\n\nUpon the death of Charles XII, [[Ulrike Eleonora of Sweden|Queen Ulrika Eleonora]] ennobled Swedenborg and his siblings. It was common in Sweden during the 17th and 18th centuries for the children of [[bishops]] to receive that honor, as a recognition of the services of their father. The family name was changed from Swedberg to Swedenborg<ref>Bergquist (1999), pp.114\u2013115</ref> (the \"en\" corresponding to the German ''[[wikt:von|von]]'').\n\nIn 1724, he was offered the chair of [[mathematics]] at [[Uppsala University]], but he declined and said that he had dealt mainly with [[geometry]], [[chemistry]] and [[metallurgy]] during his career. He also said that he did not have the gift of eloquent speech because of a stutter, as recognized by many of his acquaintances; it forced him to speak slowly and carefully, and there are no known occurrences of his speaking in public.<ref>Berquist (1999), pp. 118\u2013119</ref> The Swedish critic Olof Lagerkrantz proposed that Swedenborg compensated for his impediment by extensive argumentation in writing.<ref>Proposed by Lagercrantz, also mentioned by Bergquist (1999), p. 119.</ref>\n\n== New direction of studies ahead of his time ==\nDuring the 1730s, Swedenborg undertook many studies of [[anatomy]] and [[physiology]]. He had the first known anticipation of the [[neuron]] concept.<ref>Fodstad, H. The neuron theory ''Stereotactic and Functional Neurosurgery'' 2001;77:20-4</ref> It was not until a century later that science recognized the full significance of the nerve cell. He also had prescient ideas about the [[cerebral cortex]], the hierarchical organization of the [[nervous system]], the localization of the [[cerebrospinal fluid]], the functions of the [[pituitary gland]], the perivascular spaces, the [[foramen of Magendie]], the idea of [[somatotopic arrangement|somatotopic organization]], and the association of frontal brain regions with the intellect. In some cases, his conclusions have been experimentally verified in modern times.<ref>Gordh, E.

Swedenborg's desire to understand the order and the purpose of creation first led him to investigate the structure of matter and the process of creation itself. In the ''[[The Principia (book)|Principia]]'', he outlined his philosophical method, which incorporated experience, geometry (the means by which the inner order of the world can be known) and the power of reason. He also outlined his cosmology, which included the first presentation of his [[nebular hypothesis]]. (There is evidence that Swedenborg may have preceded Kant by as much as 20 years in the development of that hypothesis.<ref>[http://www.newchurchhistory.org/articles/glb2007/baker.pdf Baker, Gregory L. (1983) \"Emanuel Swedenborg \u2013 An 18th century cosmologist\" in ''The Physics Teacher'', October 1983, pp. 441\u20136] Retrieved 15 July 2013.</ref>)\n\nIn 1735, in [[Leipzig]], he published a three-volume work, ''Opera philosophica et mineralis'' (''\"Philosophical and mineralogical works''\") in which he tried to conjoin philosophy and [[metallurgy]]. The work was mainly appreciated for its chapters on the analysis of the [[smelting]] of iron and copper, and it was the work that gave Swedenborg his international reputation.<ref>Bergquist (1999), pp. 142\u2013155.</ref> The same year, he also published the small manuscript ''de Infinito'' (\"On the Infinite\") in which he attempted to explain how the finite is related to the infinite and how the [[Soul (spirit)|soul]] is connected to the body. It was the first manuscript in which he touched upon such matters. He knew that it might clash with established theologies since he presented the view that the soul is based on material substances.<ref>Lamm (1987), pp. 42\u201343, notes that by assuming that the soul consists of matter, as Swedenborg did, one becomes a [[materialist]]. He further notes that it was also noted by contemporaries.</ref><ref>Jonsson, Inge, ''Swedenborg och Linn\u00e9'', in Delblanc & L\u00f6nnroth, p. 321.</ref> He also conducted dedicated studies of the fashionable philosophers of the time such as [[John Locke]], [[Christian von Wolff]], [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz]], and [[Descartes]] and earlier thinkers such as [[Plato]], [[Aristotle]], [[Plotinus]] and [[Augustine of Hippo]].<ref>Bergquist (1999), pp. 165\u2013178.</ref>\n\nIn 1743, at the age of 55, Swedenborg requested a leave of absence to go abroad. His purpose was to gather source material for ''Regnum animale'' (''The Animal Kingdom'', or ''Kingdom of Life''), a subject on which books were not readily available in Sweden. The aim of the book was to explain the soul from an anatomical point of view. He had planned to produce a total of 17 volumes.<ref>Jonsson, Inge, ''Swedenborg och Linn\u00e9'', in Delblanc and L\u00f6nnroth, p.325.</ref>\n\n== ''Journal of Dreams'' ==\nBy 1744, Swedenborg had traveled to the Netherlands. Around the time, he began having strange dreams. Swedenborg carried a travel journal with him on most of his travels and did so on this journey. The whereabouts of the diary were long unknown, but it was discovered in the [[Royal Library of Sweden|Royal Library]] in the 1850s and was published in 1859 as ''Dr\u00f6mboken'', or ''Journal of Dreams''.\n\nSwedenborg experienced many different dreams and visions, some greatly pleasurable, others highly disturbing.<ref>Bergquist, pp. 200\u2013208.</ref> The experiences continued as he traveled to London to progress the publication of ''Regnum animale''. This process, which one biographer has proposed as cathartic and comparable to the [[Catholic]] concept of [[Purgatory]],<ref>Bergquist, p. 206.</ref> continued for six months. He also proposed that what Swedenborg was recording in his ''Journal of Dreams'' was a battle between the love of himself and the love of God.<ref>Analysis by Bergquist, p. 209. Bergquist has previously published a separate book commenting on the Journal called ''Swedenborgs dr\u00f6mbok : gl\u00e4djen och det stora kvalet'' (Stockholm, Norstedt, 1988).</ref>\n\n=== Visions and spiritual insights ===\nIn the last entry of the journal from 26\u201327 October 1744, Swedenborg appears to be clear as to which path to follow. He felt that he should drop his current project and write a new book about the worship of God. He soon began working on ''De cultu et amore Dei'', or ''The Worship and Love of God''. It was never fully completed, but Swedenborg still had it published in London in June 1745.<ref>Bergquist (1999), pp. 210\u2013211.</ref>\n\nIn 1745, Swedenborg was dining in a private room at a tavern in London. By the end of the meal, a darkness fell upon his eyes, and the room shifted character. Suddenly, he saw a person sitting at a corner of the room, telling him: \"Do not eat too much!\". Swedenborg, scared, hurried home. Later that night, the same man appeared in his dreams. The man told Swedenborg that he was the Lord, that he had appointed Swedenborg to reveal the spiritual meaning of the Bible and that he would guide Swedenborg in what to write. The same night, the spiritual world was opened to Swedenborg.<ref>Swedenborg (1975).</ref><ref>\"Small Theological Works and Letters\" by Emanuel Swedenborg.

He explained that he was obliged to complete a work that he had begun and requested to receive half his salary as a pension.<ref>Bergquist (1999), pp. 286\u2013287.</ref> He took up afresh his study of [[Hebrew]] and began to work on the spiritual interpretation of the Bible with the goal of interpreting the spiritual meaning of every verse.

Accessed June 2012.</ref> Some propose that he did not have a revelation at all but developed his theological ideas from sources which ranged from his father to earlier figures in the history of thought, notably [[Plotinus]]. That position was first taken by Swedish writer Martin Lamm who wrote a biography of Swedenborg in 1915.<ref>Bergquist (1999), p. 15.</ref>{{efn|The citation \"Bergquist (1999)\" is used here repeatedly but appears to contain mislabelled quotations. See the \"Talk\" section of this page under the heading \"Bergquist footnote problem\".}} Swedish critic and publicist [[Olof Lagercrantz]] had a similar point of view, calling Swedenborg's theological writing \"a poem about a foreign country with peculiar laws and customs\".<ref>''en dikt om ett fr\u00e4mmande land med s\u00e4llsamma lagar och seder''. Largercrantz (1996), back page.</ref>\n\nSwedenborg's approach to proving the veracity of his theological teachings was to use voluminous quotations from the [[Old Testament]] and the [[New Testament]] to demonstrate agreement with the Bible, and this is found throughout his theological writings, since he rejected blind faith and declared true faith to be an internal acknowledgement of the truth. The vast use of these Biblical confirmations led a Swedish Royal Council in 1771 to examine the heresy charges of 1770 against two Swedish supporters of his theological writings: \"there is much that is true and useful in Swedenborg's writings\".<ref>Sigstedt (1952), p. 408.</ref> [[Victor Hugo]] felt that Swedenborg had \"lapsed into madness\" in Chapter 14 of ''[[Les Mis\u00e9rables]]''.\n\n==Scientific beliefs==\nSwedenborg proposed many scientific ideas during his lifetime. In his youth, he wanted to present a new idea every day, as he wrote to his brother-in-law [[Erik Benzelius the Younger|Erik Benzelius]] in 1718. Around 1730, he had changed his mind, and instead believed that higher knowledge is not something that can be acquired, but that it is based on intuition. After 1745, he instead considered himself receiving scientific knowledge in a spontaneous manner from angels.<ref>Bergquist (1999), pp. 364\u2013365.</ref>\n\nFrom 1745, when he considered himself to have entered a spiritual state, he tended to phrase his \"experiences\" in [[empirical]] terms, to report accurately things he had experienced on his spiritual journeys.\n\nOne of his ideas that is considered most crucial for the understanding of his theology is his notion of [[correspondence (theology)|correspondences]]. But, in fact, he first presented the theory of correspondences only in 1744, in the first volume of ''Regnum Animale'' dealing with the human soul.<ref name=\"Delblanc\" />\n\nThe basis of the correspondence theory is that there is a relationship among the natural (\"physical\"), the spiritual, and the divine worlds. The foundations of this theory can be traced to [[Neoplatonism]] and the philosopher [[Plotinus]] in particular. With the aid of this scenario, Swedenborg now interpreted the Bible in a different light, claiming that even the most apparently trivial sentences could hold a profound spiritual meaning.<ref name=Korr>Lamm (1987 [1915]), dedicates a chapter to the correspondence theories, pp. 85\u2013109.</ref> Swedenborg argued that it is the presence of that spiritual sense which makes the Word divine.<ref>(Swedenborg E, ''The True Christian Religion Containing the Universal Theology of the New Church.''

Two hours later, he exclaimed with relief that the fire had stopped three doors from his home. In the excitement following his report, word even reached the ears of the provincial governor, who summoned Swedenborg that same evening and asked for a detailed recounting.\n\nAt that time, it took two to three days for news from Stockholm to reach Gothenburg by courier, so that is the shortest duration in which the news of the fire could reach Gothenburg. The first messenger from Stockholm with news of the fire was from the Board of Trade, who arrived Monday evening. The second messenger was a royal courier, who arrived on Tuesday.

However, ''Spiritual Experiences'' is not among the works Swedenborg published himself, and thus may not be authoritative revelation. See [http://www.swedenborgdigitallibrary.org/contets/books.html \"Which of Swedenborg's books are Divine revelation?\"]</ref>\n\nThe foundation of Swedenborg's theology was laid down in ''[[Arcana C\u0153lestia]]'' (''Heavenly Mysteries''), published in eight Latin volumes from 1749 to 1756. In a significant portion of that work, he interprets the Biblical passages of Genesis and Exodus. He reviews what he says is the inner spiritual sense of these two works of the Word of God. (He later made a similar review of the inner sense of the book of Revelation in ''Apocalypse Revealed''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.swedenborgdigitallibrary.org/contets/AR.html |title=The Apocalypse Revealed Wherein are Disclosed the Arcana Foretold Which Have Hitherto Remained Concealed |publisher=Swedenborgdigitallibrary.org |date= |accessdate=2012-08-16}}</ref>) Most of all, he was convinced that the Bible describes a human's transformation from a materialistic to a spiritual being, which he calls [[reincarnation|rebirth]] or regeneration. He begins this work by outlining how the [[creation myth]] was not an account of the creation of Earth, but an account of man's rebirth or regeneration in six steps represented by the six days of creation. Everything related to mankind in the Bible could also be related to [[Jesus Christ]], and how Christ freed himself from materialistic boundaries through the glorification of his human presence by making it Divine. Swedenborg examines this idea in his exposition of [[Book of Genesis|Genesis]] and [[Book of Exodus|Exodus]].<ref>Bergquist (1999), pp. 286\u2013309.</ref>\n\n=== Marriage ===\nOne often discussed aspect of Swedenborg's writing is his ideas on marriage. Swedenborg himself remained a bachelor all his life, but that did not hinder him from writing voluminously on the subject. His work on ''Marriage Love'' (''Conjugial Love''{{efn|\"[[wiktionary:conjugial|conjugial]]\" should not be confused with \"[[wiktionary:conjugal|conjugal]]\", the general term for marriage.}} in older translations) (1768) was dedicated to this purpose.<ref>{{cite web |url = http://www.smallcanonsearch.com/read.php?book=ml&section=1 |title = ML 1 \u2013 Small Canon Search \u2013 Reading \u2013 The Word of God, The Whole Word of God, and Nothing But the Word of God \u2013 Searching the Second Advent Christian Bible \u2013 The Second Advent Christian Canon of Scripture |publisher = Small Canon Search |date = |accessdate = 2012-08-16}}</ref>\n\nA central question with regard to marriage is whether it stops at death or continues into heaven. The question arises due to a statement attributed to Jesus that there is no marriage in heaven (Luke 20:27\u201338, Matthew 22:23\u201332, and Mark 12:18\u201327). Swedenborg wrote ''The Lord God Jesus Christ on Marriage in Heaven'' as a detailed analysis of what he meant.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.swedenborgproject.org/2011/08/22/the-lord-god-jesus-christ-on-marriage-in-heaven/ |title = The Lord God Jesus Christ on Marriage in Heaven |publisher = The Swedenborg Project |date = |accessdate = 2013-08-30}}</ref>\n\nThe quality of the relationship between husband and wife resumes in the spiritual world in whatever state it was at their death in this world. Thus, a couple in true marriage love remain together in that state in [[heaven]] into eternity. A couple lacking in that love by one or both partners, however, will separate after death and each will be given a compatible new partner if they wish.

According to ''The Heavenly Doctrine'', Jesus, the [[Son of God]], came into the world due to the spread of evil here.<ref>Swedenborg, E.

He said that people of other religions opposed Christianity because of its doctrine of a Trinity of Persons. He considered the separation of the Trinity into three separate Persons to have originated with the [[First Council of Nicaea]] and the [[Athanasian]] Creed.{{citation needed|date=January 2019}}\n\n===''Sola Fide'' (Faith Alone)===\n''The Heavenly Doctrine'' rejects the concept of salvation through [[faith alone|faith-alone]] (''sola-fide'' in Latin), since he considered both [[faith]] and [[Charity (virtue)|charity]] necessary for [[salvation]], not one without the other, whereas the Reformers taught that faith-alone procured justification, although it must be a faith which resulted in obedience. The purpose of faith, according to ''The Heavenly Doctrine'', is to lead a person to a life according to the truths of faith, which is charity, as is taught in 1 Corinthians 13:13 and James 2:20.\n\nIn other words, Swedenborg spoke sharply against the faith-alone doctrine of Luther and others. He held that justification before God was not based solely upon some imputed righteousness before God, and was not achievable merely by a gift of God's grace (''sola gratia''), granted without any basis in a person's actual behavior in life.  ''Sola-fide'' was a doctrine averred by Martin Luther, John Calvin, Ulrich Zwingli and others during the Protestant Reformation, and was a core belief especially in the theology of the Lutheran reformers [[Martin Luther]] and [[Philip Melanchthon]].\n\nAlthough the ''sola-fide'' doctrine of the Reformers also emphasized that saving faith was one that effected works<ref>{{cite web|url=http://peacebyjesus.witnesstoday.org/Reformation_faith_works.html |title=Reformation Faith + Works |publisher=Peacebyjesus.witnesstoday.org |date= |accessdate=2012-08-16}}</ref> (by faith-alone, but not by a faith which is alone), Swedenborg protested against faith-alone being the instrument of justification, and held that salvation is only possible through the conjunction of faith and charity in a person, and that the purpose of faith is to lead a person to live according to the truths of faith, which is [[Charity (virtue)|charity]]. He further states that faith and charity must be exercised by doing good out of willing good whenever possible, which are good works or good uses or the conjunction perishes. In one section he wrote:\n\n{{quotation|It is very evident from their [[Epistles]] that it never entered the mind of any of the [[apostles]] that the church of this day would separate faith from charity by teaching that [[Sola fide|faith-alone]] justifies and saves apart from the works of the law, and that charity therefore cannot be conjoined with faith, since faith is from God, and charity, so far as it is expressed in works, is from man. But this separation and division were introduced into the Christian church when it divided God into three persons, and ascribed to each equal Divinity.|True Christian Religion, section 355<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.biblemeanings.info/books/tcr/sect-336ff.html#TCR355 |title=True Christian Religion, sections 336 ff |publisher=Biblemeanings.info |date= |accessdate=2011-03-06}}</ref>}}\n\n== Later history ==\nSwedenborg made no attempt to found a church.<ref>Block, M.B [https://archive.org/details/newchurchinthene028276mbp ''The New Church in the New World.

A similar conclusion was proposed more recently by [[psychiatrist]] John Johnson in \"Henry Maudsley on Swedenborg's messianic psychosis\", ''British Journal of Psychiatry'' 165:690\u2013691 (1994), who wrote that Swedenborg suffered hallucinations of \"acute [[schizophrenia]] or epileptic [[psychosis]]\".

White worked for the Swedenborg Society in London and wrote an affirmative biography of Swedenborg.  However, he was fired for publishing spiritist books and selling them at the Society's store, as well as otherwise interfering with the Society's function.

While controversial, the beliefs were to have a major impact on his son Emanuel's spirituality.

This also came to have a strong impact on Emanuel.<ref name=\"Ugglan\"/><ref name=enc1911/><ref>Martin Lamm (1978 [1915]; pp.1\u201319) notes how all Swedenborg biographies at that draw similarities between the beliefs of Jesper and Emanuel.

Swedenborg completed his university course at [[Uppsala]] in 1709, and in 1710, he made his [[grand tour]] through the Netherlands, France and Germany before reaching London, where he would spend the next four years. It was also a flourishing centre of scientific ideas and discoveries. Swedenborg studied [[physics]], [[mechanics]] and [[philosophy]] and read and wrote [[poetry]]. According to the preface of a book by the Swedish critic [[Olof Lagercrantz]], Swedenborg wrote to his benefactor and brother-in-law Benzelius that he believed that Swedenborg might be destined to be a great scientist.<ref>Lagercrantz, preface.</ref><ref name=Delblanc>x</ref>\n\n== Scientific period ==\n[[File:Swdbg2.jpg|frame|[[Swedenborg 1714 Flying Machine|The Flying Machine]], sketched in his notebook from 1714.

A first step was his meeting with King [[Charles XII of Sweden]] in the city of [[Lund]], in 1716. The Swedish inventor [[Christopher Polhem]], who became a close friend of Swedenborg, was also present. Swedenborg's purpose was to persuade the king to fund an [[observatory]] in northern Sweden. However, the warlike king did not consider this project important enough, but did appoint Swedenborg to be assessor-extraordinary on the [[Swedish Board of Mines]] (''Bergskollegium'') in [[Stockholm]].<ref>The meeting between the King, Polhelm and Swedenborg is described in detail in Liljegren, Bengt, ''Karl XII i Lund : n\u00e4r Sverige styrdes fr\u00e5n Sk\u00e5ne'', (Historiska media, Lund, 1999). {{ISBN|91-88930-51-3}}.</ref>\n\nFrom 1716 to 1718, Swedenborg published a scientific periodical entitled ''Daedalus Hyperboreus'' (''\"The Northern [[Daedalus]]\"''), a record of mechanical and mathematical inventions and discoveries. One notable description was that of [[Swedenborg 1714 Flying Machine|a flying machine]], the same he had been sketching a few years earlier.<ref name=\"Delblanc\" />\n\nIn 1718, Swedenborg published an article that attempted to explain spiritual and mental events in terms of minute vibrations, or \"tremulations\".\n\nUpon the death of Charles XII, [[Ulrike Eleonora of Sweden|Queen Ulrika Eleonora]] ennobled Swedenborg and his siblings. It was common in Sweden during the 17th and 18th centuries for the children of [[bishops]] to receive that honor, as a recognition of the services of their father. The family name was changed from Swedberg to Swedenborg<ref>Bergquist (1999), pp.114\u2013115</ref> (the \"en\" corresponding to the German ''[[wikt:von|von]]'').\n\nIn 1724, he was offered the chair of [[mathematics]] at [[Uppsala University]], but he declined and said that he had dealt mainly with [[geometry]], [[chemistry]] and [[metallurgy]] during his career. He also said that he did not have the gift of eloquent speech because of a stutter, as recognized by many of his acquaintances; it forced him to speak slowly and carefully, and there are no known occurrences of his speaking in public.<ref>Berquist (1999), pp. 118\u2013119</ref> The Swedish critic Olof Lagerkrantz proposed that Swedenborg compensated for his impediment by extensive argumentation in writing.<ref>Proposed by Lagercrantz, also mentioned by Bergquist (1999), p. 119.</ref>\n\n== New direction of studies ahead of his time ==\nDuring the 1730s, Swedenborg undertook many studies of [[anatomy]] and [[physiology]]. He had the first known anticipation of the [[neuron]] concept.<ref>Fodstad, H. The neuron theory ''Stereotactic and Functional Neurosurgery'' 2001;77:20-4</ref> It was not until a century later that science recognized the full significance of the nerve cell. He also had prescient ideas about the [[cerebral cortex]], the hierarchical organization of the [[nervous system]], the localization of the [[cerebrospinal fluid]], the functions of the [[pituitary gland]], the perivascular spaces, the [[foramen of Magendie]], the idea of [[somatotopic arrangement|somatotopic organization]], and the association of frontal brain regions with the intellect. In some cases, his conclusions have been experimentally verified in modern times.<ref>Gordh, E.

Swedenborg's desire to understand the order and the purpose of creation first led him to investigate the structure of matter and the process of creation itself. In the ''[[The Principia (book)|Principia]]'', he outlined his philosophical method, which incorporated experience, geometry (the means by which the inner order of the world can be known) and the power of reason. He also outlined his cosmology, which included the first presentation of his [[nebular hypothesis]]. (There is evidence that Swedenborg may have preceded Kant by as much as 20 years in the development of that hypothesis.<ref>[http://www.newchurchhistory.org/articles/glb2007/baker.pdf Baker, Gregory L. (1983) \"Emanuel Swedenborg \u2013 An 18th century cosmologist\" in ''The Physics Teacher'', October 1983, pp. 441\u20136] Retrieved 15 July 2013.</ref>)\n\nIn 1735, in [[Leipzig]], he published a three-volume work, ''Opera philosophica et mineralis'' (''\"Philosophical and mineralogical works''\") in which he tried to conjoin philosophy and [[metallurgy]]. The work was mainly appreciated for its chapters on the analysis of the [[smelting]] of iron and copper, and it was the work that gave Swedenborg his international reputation.<ref>Bergquist (1999), pp. 142\u2013155.</ref> The same year, he also published the small manuscript ''de Infinito'' (\"On the Infinite\") in which he attempted to explain how the finite is related to the infinite and how the [[Soul (spirit)|soul]] is connected to the body. It was the first manuscript in which he touched upon such matters. He knew that it might clash with established theologies since he presented the view that the soul is based on material substances.<ref>Lamm (1987), pp. 42\u201343, notes that by assuming that the soul consists of matter, as Swedenborg did, one becomes a [[materialist]]. He further notes that it was also noted by contemporaries.</ref><ref>Jonsson, Inge, ''Swedenborg och Linn\u00e9'', in Delblanc & L\u00f6nnroth, p. 321.</ref> He also conducted dedicated studies of the fashionable philosophers of the time such as [[John Locke]], [[Christian von Wolff]], [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz]], and [[Descartes]] and earlier thinkers such as [[Plato]], [[Aristotle]], [[Plotinus]] and [[Augustine of Hippo]].<ref>Bergquist (1999), pp. 165\u2013178.</ref>\n\nIn 1743, at the age of 55, Swedenborg requested a leave of absence to go abroad. His purpose was to gather source material for ''Regnum animale'' (''The Animal Kingdom'', or ''Kingdom of Life''), a subject on which books were not readily available in Sweden. The aim of the book was to explain the soul from an anatomical point of view. He had planned to produce a total of 17 volumes.<ref>Jonsson, Inge, ''Swedenborg och Linn\u00e9'', in Delblanc and L\u00f6nnroth, p.325.</ref>\n\n== ''Journal of Dreams'' ==\nBy 1744, Swedenborg had traveled to the Netherlands. Around the time, he began having strange dreams. Swedenborg carried a travel journal with him on most of his travels and did so on this journey. The whereabouts of the diary were long unknown, but it was discovered in the [[Royal Library of Sweden|Royal Library]] in the 1850s and was published in 1859 as ''Dr\u00f6mboken'', or ''Journal of Dreams''.\n\nSwedenborg experienced many different dreams and visions, some greatly pleasurable, others highly disturbing.<ref>Bergquist, pp. 200\u2013208.</ref> The experiences continued as he traveled to London to progress the publication of ''Regnum animale''. This process, which one biographer has proposed as cathartic and comparable to the [[Catholic]] concept of [[Purgatory]],<ref>Bergquist, p. 206.</ref> continued for six months. He also proposed that what Swedenborg was recording in his ''Journal of Dreams'' was a battle between the love of himself and the love of God.<ref>Analysis by Bergquist, p. 209. Bergquist has previously published a separate book commenting on the Journal called ''Swedenborgs dr\u00f6mbok : gl\u00e4djen och det stora kvalet'' (Stockholm, Norstedt, 1988).</ref>\n\n=== Visions and spiritual insights ===\nIn the last entry of the journal from 26\u201327 October 1744, Swedenborg appears to be clear as to which path to follow. He felt that he should drop his current project and write a new book about the worship of God. He soon began working on ''De cultu et amore Dei'', or ''The Worship and Love of God''. It was never fully completed, but Swedenborg still had it published in London in June 1745.<ref>Bergquist (1999), pp. 210\u2013211.</ref>\n\nIn 1745, Swedenborg was dining in a private room at a tavern in London. By the end of the meal, a darkness fell upon his eyes, and the room shifted character. Suddenly, he saw a person sitting at a corner of the room, telling him: \"Do not eat too much!\". Swedenborg, scared, hurried home. Later that night, the same man appeared in his dreams. The man told Swedenborg that he was the Lord, that he had appointed Swedenborg to reveal the spiritual meaning of the Bible and that he would guide Swedenborg in what to write. The same night, the spiritual world was opened to Swedenborg.<ref>Swedenborg (1975).</ref><ref>\"Small Theological Works and Letters\" by Emanuel Swedenborg.

He explained that he was obliged to complete a work that he had begun and requested to receive half his salary as a pension.<ref>Bergquist (1999), pp. 286\u2013287.</ref> He took up afresh his study of [[Hebrew]] and began to work on the spiritual interpretation of the Bible with the goal of interpreting the spiritual meaning of every verse.

Accessed June 2012.</ref> Some propose that he did not have a revelation at all but developed his theological ideas from sources which ranged from his father to earlier figures in the history of thought, notably [[Plotinus]]. That position was first taken by Swedish writer Martin Lamm who wrote a biography of Swedenborg in 1915.<ref>Bergquist (1999), p. 15.</ref>{{efn|The citation \"Bergquist (1999)\" is used here repeatedly but appears to contain mislabelled quotations. See the \"Talk\" section of this page under the heading \"Bergquist footnote problem\".}} Swedish critic and publicist [[Olof Lagercrantz]] had a similar point of view, calling Swedenborg's theological writing \"a poem about a foreign country with peculiar laws and customs\".<ref>''en dikt om ett fr\u00e4mmande land med s\u00e4llsamma lagar och seder''. Largercrantz (1996), back page.</ref>\n\nSwedenborg's approach to proving the veracity of his theological teachings was to use voluminous quotations from the [[Old Testament]] and the [[New Testament]] to demonstrate agreement with the Bible, and this is found throughout his theological writings, since he rejected blind faith and declared true faith to be an internal acknowledgement of the truth. The vast use of these Biblical confirmations led a Swedish Royal Council in 1771 to examine the heresy charges of 1770 against two Swedish supporters of his theological writings: \"there is much that is true and useful in Swedenborg's writings\".<ref>Sigstedt (1952), p. 408.</ref> [[Victor Hugo]] felt that Swedenborg had \"lapsed into madness\" in Chapter 14 of ''[[Les Mis\u00e9rables]]''.\n\n==Scientific beliefs==\nSwedenborg proposed many scientific ideas during his lifetime. In his youth, he wanted to present a new idea every day, as he wrote to his brother-in-law [[Erik Benzelius the Younger|Erik Benzelius]] in 1718. Around 1730, he had changed his mind, and instead believed that higher knowledge is not something that can be acquired, but that it is based on intuition. After 1745, he instead considered himself receiving scientific knowledge in a spontaneous manner from angels.<ref>Bergquist (1999), pp. 364\u2013365.</ref>\n\nFrom 1745, when he considered himself to have entered a spiritual state, he tended to phrase his \"experiences\" in [[empirical]] terms, to report accurately things he had experienced on his spiritual journeys.\n\nOne of his ideas that is considered most crucial for the understanding of his theology is his notion of [[correspondence (theology)|correspondences]]. But, in fact, he first presented the theory of correspondences only in 1744, in the first volume of ''Regnum Animale'' dealing with the human soul.<ref name=\"Delblanc\" />\n\nThe basis of the correspondence theory is that there is a relationship among the natural (\"physical\"), the spiritual, and the divine worlds. The foundations of this theory can be traced to [[Neoplatonism]] and the philosopher [[Plotinus]] in particular. With the aid of this scenario, Swedenborg now interpreted the Bible in a different light, claiming that even the most apparently trivial sentences could hold a profound spiritual meaning.<ref name=Korr>Lamm (1987 [1915]), dedicates a chapter to the correspondence theories, pp. 85\u2013109.</ref> Swedenborg argued that it is the presence of that spiritual sense which makes the Word divine.<ref>(Swedenborg E, ''The True Christian Religion Containing the Universal Theology of the New Church.''

He became agitated and told the party at six o'clock that there was a fire in Stockholm, that it had consumed his neighbor's home and was threatening his own. Two hours later, he exclaimed with relief that the fire had stopped three doors from his home. In the excitement following his report, word even reached the ears of the provincial governor, who summoned Swedenborg that same evening and asked for a detailed recounting.\n\nAt that time, it took two to three days for news from Stockholm to reach Gothenburg by courier, so that is the shortest duration in which the news of the fire could reach Gothenburg. The first messenger from Stockholm with news of the fire was from the Board of Trade, who arrived Monday evening. The second messenger was a royal courier, who arrived on Tuesday. Both of these reports confirmed every statement to the precise hour that Swedenborg first expressed the information.

See [http://www.swedenborgdigitallibrary.org/contets/books.html \"Which of Swedenborg's books are Divine revelation?\"]</ref>\n\nThe foundation of Swedenborg's theology was laid down in ''[[Arcana C\u0153lestia]]'' (''Heavenly Mysteries''), published in eight Latin volumes from 1749 to 1756. In a significant portion of that work, he interprets the Biblical passages of Genesis and Exodus. He reviews what he says is the inner spiritual sense of these two works of the Word of God. (He later made a similar review of the inner sense of the book of Revelation in ''Apocalypse Revealed''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.swedenborgdigitallibrary.org/contets/AR.html |title=The Apocalypse Revealed Wherein are Disclosed the Arcana Foretold Which Have Hitherto Remained Concealed |publisher=Swedenborgdigitallibrary.org |date= |accessdate=2012-08-16}}</ref>) Most of all, he was convinced that the Bible describes a human's transformation from a materialistic to a spiritual being, which he calls [[reincarnation|rebirth]] or regeneration. He begins this work by outlining how the [[creation myth]] was not an account of the creation of Earth, but an account of man's rebirth or regeneration in six steps represented by the six days of creation. Everything related to mankind in the Bible could also be related to [[Jesus Christ]], and how Christ freed himself from materialistic boundaries through the glorification of his human presence by making it Divine. Swedenborg examines this idea in his exposition of [[Book of Genesis|Genesis]] and [[Book of Exodus|Exodus]].<ref>Bergquist (1999), pp. 286\u2013309.</ref>\n\n=== Marriage ===\nOne often discussed aspect of Swedenborg's writing is his ideas on marriage. Swedenborg himself remained a bachelor all his life, but that did not hinder him from writing voluminously on the subject. His work on ''Marriage Love'' (''Conjugial Love''{{efn|\"[[wiktionary:conjugial|conjugial]]\" should not be confused with \"[[wiktionary:conjugal|conjugal]]\", the general term for marriage.}} in older translations) (1768) was dedicated to this purpose.<ref>{{cite web |url = http://www.smallcanonsearch.com/read.php?book=ml&section=1 |title = ML 1 \u2013 Small Canon Search \u2013 Reading \u2013 The Word of God, The Whole Word of God, and Nothing But the Word of God \u2013 Searching the Second Advent Christian Bible \u2013 The Second Advent Christian Canon of Scripture |publisher = Small Canon Search |date = |accessdate = 2012-08-16}}</ref>\n\nA central question with regard to marriage is whether it stops at death or continues into heaven. The question arises due to a statement attributed to Jesus that there is no marriage in heaven (Luke 20:27\u201338, Matthew 22:23\u201332, and Mark 12:18\u201327). Swedenborg wrote ''The Lord God Jesus Christ on Marriage in Heaven'' as a detailed analysis of what he meant.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.swedenborgproject.org/2011/08/22/the-lord-god-jesus-christ-on-marriage-in-heaven/ |title = The Lord God Jesus Christ on Marriage in Heaven |publisher = The Swedenborg Project |date = |accessdate = 2013-08-30}}</ref>\n\nThe quality of the relationship between husband and wife resumes in the spiritual world in whatever state it was at their death in this world. Thus, a couple in true marriage love remain together in that state in [[heaven]] into eternity. A couple lacking in that love by one or both partners, however, will separate after death and each will be given a compatible new partner if they wish. A partner is also given to a person who loved the ideal of marriage but never found a true partner in this world. The exception in both cases is a person who hates chaste marriage and thus cannot receive such a partner.<ref>{{cite web |url = http://www.smallcanonsearch.com/read.php?book=ml&section=46 |title=Marriage Love 46\u201350) |publisher=Smallcanonsearch.com |date= |accessdate=2012-08-16}}</ref>\n\nSwedenborg saw creation as a series of pairings, descending from the Divine love and wisdom<ref>{{cite web |url = http://www.smallcanonsearch.com/read.php?book=dlw&section=52 |title =Marriage Love No. 52 |publisher=Smallcanonsearch.com |date= |accessdate=2012-08-16}}</ref> that define [[God]] and are the basis of creation.

In the case of marriage, the object is to bring about the joining together of the two partners at the spiritual and physical levels, and the happiness that comes as a consequence.\n\n===Trinity===\nSwedenborg rejected the common explanation of the [[Trinity]] as a Trinity of Persons, which he said was not taught in the [[early Christian]] church. There was, for instance, no mention in the [[Apostle (Christian)|Apostolic]] writings of any \"Son from eternity\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.smallcanonsearch.com/read.php?book=tcr&section=175 |title=TCR 175 \u2013 Small Canon Search \u2013 Reading \u2013 The Word of God, The Whole Word of God, and Nothing But the Word of God \u2013 Searching the Second Advent Christian Bible \u2013 The Second Advent Christian Canon of Scripture |publisher=Small Canon Search |date= |accessdate=2012-08-16}}</ref> Instead he explained in his theological writings how the Divine Trinity exists in One Person, in One God, the Lord [[Jesus Christ]], which he said is taught in Colossians 2:9. According to ''The Heavenly Doctrine'', Jesus, the [[Son of God]], came into the world due to the spread of evil here.<ref>Swedenborg, E.

He said that people of other religions opposed Christianity because of its doctrine of a Trinity of Persons. He considered the separation of the Trinity into three separate Persons to have originated with the [[First Council of Nicaea]] and the [[Athanasian]] Creed.{{citation needed|date=January 2019}}\n\n===''Sola Fide'' (Faith Alone)===\n''The Heavenly Doctrine'' rejects the concept of salvation through [[faith alone|faith-alone]] (''sola-fide'' in Latin), since he considered both [[faith]] and [[Charity (virtue)|charity]] necessary for [[salvation]], not one without the other, whereas the Reformers taught that faith-alone procured justification, although it must be a faith which resulted in obedience. The purpose of faith, according to ''The Heavenly Doctrine'', is to lead a person to a life according to the truths of faith, which is charity, as is taught in 1 Corinthians 13:13 and James 2:20.\n\nIn other words, Swedenborg spoke sharply against the faith-alone doctrine of Luther and others. He held that justification before God was not based solely upon some imputed righteousness before God, and was not achievable merely by a gift of God's grace (''sola gratia''), granted without any basis in a person's actual behavior in life.  ''Sola-fide'' was a doctrine averred by Martin Luther, John Calvin, Ulrich Zwingli and others during the Protestant Reformation, and was a core belief especially in the theology of the Lutheran reformers [[Martin Luther]] and [[Philip Melanchthon]].\n\nAlthough the ''sola-fide'' doctrine of the Reformers also emphasized that saving faith was one that effected works<ref>{{cite web|url=http://peacebyjesus.witnesstoday.org/Reformation_faith_works.html |title=Reformation Faith + Works |publisher=Peacebyjesus.witnesstoday.org |date= |accessdate=2012-08-16}}</ref> (by faith-alone, but not by a faith which is alone), Swedenborg protested against faith-alone being the instrument of justification, and held that salvation is only possible through the conjunction of faith and charity in a person, and that the purpose of faith is to lead a person to live according to the truths of faith, which is [[Charity (virtue)|charity]]. He further states that faith and charity must be exercised by doing good out of willing good whenever possible, which are good works or good uses or the conjunction perishes. In one section he wrote:\n\n{{quotation|It is very evident from their [[Epistles]] that it never entered the mind of any of the [[apostles]] that the church of this day would separate faith from charity by teaching that [[Sola fide|faith-alone]] justifies and saves apart from the works of the law, and that charity therefore cannot be conjoined with faith, since faith is from God, and charity, so far as it is expressed in works, is from man. But this separation and division were introduced into the Christian church when it divided God into three persons, and ascribed to each equal Divinity.|True Christian Religion, section 355<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.biblemeanings.info/books/tcr/sect-336ff.html#TCR355 |title=True Christian Religion, sections 336 ff |publisher=Biblemeanings.info |date= |accessdate=2011-03-06}}</ref>}}\n\n== Later history ==\nSwedenborg made no attempt to found a church.<ref>Block, M.B [https://archive.org/details/newchurchinthene028276mbp ''The New Church in the New World.

''Swedenborg: his life and writings'' Bath : I. Pitman, Phonetic Institution, 1856) and this second one in 1867. White worked for the Swedenborg Society in London and wrote an affirmative biography of Swedenborg.  However, he was fired for publishing spiritist books and selling them at the Society's store, as well as otherwise interfering with the Society's function. White's response was the 1867 biography, in which he, in Tafel's words, \"turn[ed] a complete somersault in his convictions,\" and wrote a highly derogatory biography of Swedenborg and his teachings.

When Gardner featured Conway's Game of Life in his [[Mathematical Games column]] in October 1970, it became the most widely read of all his columns and made Conway an instant celebrity.<ref>''[https://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-29688355 Martin Gardner, puzzle master extraordinaire]'' by [[Colm Mulcahy]], [[BBC News Magazine]], 21 October 2014: \"The Game of Life appeared in Scientific American in 1970, and was by far the most successful of Gardner's columns, in terms of reader response.\"</ref><ref name=topten>Mulcahy (2014).</ref> Gardner and Conway had first corresponded in the late 1950s, and over the years Gardner had frequently written about recreational aspects of Conway's work.<ref>[http://mathfactor.uark.edu/2010/06/ha-conway-on-gardner/ The Math Factor Podcast Website] John H. Conway reminisces on his long friendship and collaboration with Martin Gardner.</ref> For instance, he discussed Conway's game of [[Sprouts (game)|Sprouts]] (Jul 1967), [[Hackenbush]] (Jan 1972), and his [[Angel problem|angel and devil problem]] (Feb 1974). In the September 1976 column he reviewed Conway's book ''[[On Numbers and Games]]'' and even managed to explain Conway's [[surreal numbers]].<ref>Martin Gardner, ''Penrose Tiles to Trapdoor Ciphers'', W. H. Freeman & Co., 1989, {{ISBN|0-7167-1987-8}}, Chapter 4. A non-technical overview; reprint of the 1976 Scientific American article.</ref> \n\nConway was probably the most important member of[[Martin_Gardner#Martin_Gardner's_Mathematical_Grapevine| Martin Gardner's Mathematical Grapevine]]. He regularly visited Gardner and often wrote him long letters summarizing his recreational research.  In a 1976 visit Gardner pretty much held him prisoner for a week, pumping him for information on the [[Penrose tiling]]s which had just been announced.\u00a0 Conway had discovered many (if not most) of the major properties of the tilings.<ref>''[http://www.ams.org/notices/200506/fea-gardner.pdf Interview with Martin Gardner]'' [[Notices of the AMS]], Vol. 52, No. 6, June/July 2005, pp. 602\u2013611</ref> Gardner used these results when he introduced the world to Penrose tiles in his January 1977 column.<ref>[https://www.quantamagazine.org/john-conways-life-in-games-20150828/ A Life In Games: The Playful Genius of John Conway] by [[Siobhan Roberts]], [[Quanta Magazine]], August 28, 2015</ref> The cover of that issue of Scientific American features the Penrose tiles and is based on a sketch by Conway.<ref name=topten/>\n\nConferences called [[Gathering 4 Gardner]] are held every two years to celebrate the legacy of Martin Gardner, and Conway himself was often a featured speaker at these events, discussing various aspects of recreational mathematics.<ref>[http://gathering4gardner.org/VIDEOS.html Presentation Videos] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160809042801/http://gathering4gardner.org/VIDEOS.html |date=9 August 2016 }} from 2014 Gathering 4 Gardner</ref><ref name= bellos>Bellos, Alex (2008). ''[https://www.theguardian.com/science/2008/may/31/maths.science The science of fun]'' The Guardian, 30 May 2008</ref>\n\n==Major areas of research==\n\n===Combinatorial game theory===\nConway is widely known for his contributions to [[combinatorial game theory]] (CGT), a theory of [[partisan game]]s. This he developed with [[Elwyn Berlekamp]] and [[Richard K. Guy|Richard Guy]], and with them also co-authored the book ''[[Winning Ways for your Mathematical Plays]]''. He also wrote the book ''[[On Numbers and Games]]'' (''ONAG'') which lays out the mathematical foundations of CGT.\n\nHe is also one of the inventors of [[Sprouts (game)|sprouts]], as well as [[phutball|philosopher's football]]. He developed detailed analyses of many other games and puzzles, such as the [[Soma cube]], [[peg solitaire]], and [[Conway's soldiers]]. He came up with the [[angel problem]], which was solved in 2006.\n\nHe invented a new system of numbers, the [[surreal numbers]], which are closely related to certain games and have been the subject of a mathematical novelette by [[Donald Knuth]].<ref>[http://discovermagazine.com/1995/dec/infinityplusonea599 Infinity Plus One, and Other Surreal Numbers] by Polly Shulman, [[Discover Magazine]], 1 December 1995</ref> He also invented a nomenclature for exceedingly [[large number]]s, the [[Conway chained arrow notation]]. Much of this is discussed in the 0th part of ''ONAG''.\n\n===Geometry===\nIn the mid-1960s with [[Michael Guy (computer scientist)|Michael Guy]], Conway established that there are sixty-four [[uniform polychoron|convex uniform polychora]] excluding two infinite sets of prismatic forms. They discovered the [[grand antiprism]] in the process, the only [[non-Wythoffian]] uniform [[polychoron]]. Conway has also suggested a system of notation dedicated to describing [[polyhedra]] called [[Conway polyhedron notation]].\n\nIn the theory of tessellations, he devised the [[Conway criterion]] which describes rules for deciding if a prototile will tile the plane.<ref name=rhoads>{{cite journal| doi=10.1016/j.cam.2004.05.002 | volume=174 | issue=2 | title=Planar tilings by polyominoes, polyhexes, and polyiamonds | year=2005 | journal=Journal of Computational and Applied Mathematics | pages=329\u2013353 | last1 = Rhoads | first1 = Glenn C.| bibcode=2005JCoAM.174..329R }}</ref>\n\nHe investigated lattices in higher dimensions, and was the first to determine the symmetry group of the [[Leech lattice]].\n\n===Geometric topology===\nIn knot theory, Conway formulated a new variation of the [[Alexander polynomial]] and produced a new invariant now called the Conway polynomial.<ref>[http://mathworld.wolfram.com/ConwayPolynomial.html Conway Polynomial] [[Wolfram MathWorld]]</ref> After lying dormant for more than a decade, this concept became central to work in the 1980s on the novel [[knot polynomial]]s.<ref>Livingston, Charles, Knot Theory (MAA Textbooks), 1993, {{ISBN|0883850273}}</ref> Conway further developed [[tangle theory]] and invented a system of notation for tabulating knots, nowadays known as [[Conway notation (knot theory)|Conway notation]], while correcting a number of errors in the 19th century knot tables and extending them to include all but four of the non-alternating primes with 11 crossings. See Topology Proceedings 7 (1982) 118.\n\n===Group theory===\nHe was the primary author of the ''[[ATLAS of Finite Groups]]'' giving properties of many [[finite simple group]]s. Working with his colleagues Robert Curtis and [[Simon P. Norton]] he constructed the first concrete representations of some of the [[sporadic group]]s. More specifically, he discovered three sporadic groups based on the symmetry of the [[Leech lattice]], which have been designated the [[Conway groups]].<ref name=harris>Harris (2015)</ref> This work made him a key player in the successful [[classification of the finite simple groups]].\n\nBased on a 1978 observation by mathematician [[John McKay (mathematician)|John McKay]], Conway and Norton formulated the complex of conjectures known as [[monstrous moonshine]]. This subject, named by Conway, relates the [[monster group]] with [[elliptic modular function]]s, thus bridging two previously distinct areas of mathematics\u2013[[finite group]]s and [[complex function theory]]. Monstrous moonshine theory has now been revealed to also have deep connections to [[string theory]].<ref>[http://www.daviddarling.info/encyclopedia/M/Monstrous_Moonshine_conjecture.html Monstrous Moonshine conjecture] David Darling: Encyclopedia of Science</ref>\n\nConway introduced the [[Mathieu groupoid]], an extension of the [[Mathieu group M12|Mathieu group M<sub>12</sub>]] to 13 points.\n\n===Number theory===\nAs a graduate student, he proved one case of a [[Waring's problem|conjecture]] by [[Edward Waring]], that in which every integer could be written as the sum of 37 numbers, each raised to the fifth power, though [[Chen Jingrun]] solved the problem independently before Conway's work could be published.<ref>[http://www.ems-ph.org/journals/newsletter/pdf/2005-09-57.pdf#page=34 Breakfast with John Horton Conway]</ref>\n\n===Algebra===\nConway has written textbooks and done original work in algebra, focusing particularly on [[quaternion]]s and [[octonion]]s.<ref>Conway and Smith (2003): \"Conway and Smith's book is a wonderful introduction to the normed division algebras: the real numbers, the complex numbers, the quaternions, and the octonions.\"</ref>  Together with [[Neil Sloane]], he invented the [[icosians]].<ref>{{cite web| url=http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/week20.html| title=This Week's Finds in Mathematical Physics (Week 20)| author=John Baez| date=2 October 1993}}</ref>\n\n===Analysis===\nHe invented a [[Conway base 13 function|base 13 function]] as a counterexample to the [[converse (logic)|converse]] of the [[intermediate value theorem]]: the function takes on every real value in each interval on the real line, so it has a [[Darboux property]] but is ''not'' [[continuous function|continuous]].\n\n===Algorithmics===\nFor calculating the day of the week, he invented the [[Doomsday algorithm]]. The algorithm is simple enough for anyone with basic arithmetic ability to do the calculations mentally. Conway can usually give the correct answer in under two seconds. To improve his speed, he practices his calendrical calculations on his computer, which is programmed to quiz him with random dates every time he logs on. One of his early books was on [[finite-state machine]]s.\n\n===Theoretical physics===\nIn 2004, Conway and [[Simon B. Kochen]], another Princeton mathematician, proved the [[free will theorem]], a startling version of the \"[[Hidden-variable theory|no hidden variables]]\" principle of [[quantum mechanics]]. It states that given certain conditions, if an experimenter can freely decide what quantities to measure in a particular experiment, then elementary particles must be free to choose their spins to make the measurements consistent with physical law. In Conway's provocative wording: \"if experimenters have [[free will]], then so do elementary particles.\"<ref>''[http://www.cs.auckland.ac.nz/~jas/one/freewill-theorem.html Conway's Proof Of The Free Will Theorem] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100516002546/http://www.cs.auckland.ac.nz/~jas/one/freewill-theorem.html |date=16 May 2010 }}'' by Jasvir Nagra</ref>\n\n==Awards and honours==\nConway received the [[Berwick Prizes|Berwick Prize]] (1971),<ref name=\"LMS Prizewinners\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.lms.ac.uk/prizes/list-lms-prize-winners|title=List of LMS prize winners &#124; London Mathematical Society|website=www.lms.ac.uk}}</ref> was elected a [[Fellow of the Royal Society]] (1981),<ref name=royal/> was the first recipient of the [[P\u00f3lya Prize (LMS)]] (1987),<ref name=\"LMS Prizewinners\"/> won the [[Nemmers Prize in Mathematics]] (1998) and received the [[Leroy P.

Conway reminisces on his long friendship and collaboration with Martin Gardner.</ref> For instance, he discussed Conway's game of [[Sprouts (game)|Sprouts]] (Jul 1967), [[Hackenbush]] (Jan 1972), and his [[Angel problem|angel and devil problem]] (Feb 1974). In the September 1976 column he reviewed Conway's book ''[[On Numbers and Games]]'' and even managed to explain Conway's [[surreal numbers]].<ref>Martin Gardner, ''Penrose Tiles to Trapdoor Ciphers'', W.

He regularly visited Gardner and often wrote him long letters summarizing his recreational research.  In a 1976 visit Gardner pretty much held him prisoner for a week, pumping him for information on the [[Penrose tiling]]s which had just been announced.\u00a0 Conway had discovered many (if not most) of the major properties of the tilings.<ref>''[http://www.ams.org/notices/200506/fea-gardner.pdf Interview with Martin Gardner]'' [[Notices of the AMS]], Vol. 52, No. 6, June/July 2005, pp. 602\u2013611</ref> Gardner used these results when he introduced the world to Penrose tiles in his January 1977 column.<ref>[https://www.quantamagazine.org/john-conways-life-in-games-20150828/ A Life In Games: The Playful Genius of John Conway] by [[Siobhan Roberts]], [[Quanta Magazine]], August 28, 2015</ref> The cover of that issue of Scientific American features the Penrose tiles and is based on a sketch by Conway.<ref name=topten/>\n\nConferences called [[Gathering 4 Gardner]] are held every two years to celebrate the legacy of Martin Gardner, and Conway himself was often a featured speaker at these events, discussing various aspects of recreational mathematics.<ref>[http://gathering4gardner.org/VIDEOS.html Presentation Videos] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160809042801/http://gathering4gardner.org/VIDEOS.html |date=9 August 2016 }} from 2014 Gathering 4 Gardner</ref><ref name= bellos>Bellos, Alex (2008). ''[https://www.theguardian.com/science/2008/may/31/maths.science The science of fun]'' The Guardian, 30 May 2008</ref>\n\n==Major areas of research==\n\n===Combinatorial game theory===\nConway is widely known for his contributions to [[combinatorial game theory]] (CGT), a theory of [[partisan game]]s. This he developed with [[Elwyn Berlekamp]] and [[Richard K. Guy|Richard Guy]], and with them also co-authored the book ''[[Winning Ways for your Mathematical Plays]]''. He also wrote the book ''[[On Numbers and Games]]'' (''ONAG'') which lays out the mathematical foundations of CGT.\n\nHe is also one of the inventors of [[Sprouts (game)|sprouts]], as well as [[phutball|philosopher's football]]. He developed detailed analyses of many other games and puzzles, such as the [[Soma cube]], [[peg solitaire]], and [[Conway's soldiers]]. He came up with the [[angel problem]], which was solved in 2006.\n\nHe invented a new system of numbers, the [[surreal numbers]], which are closely related to certain games and have been the subject of a mathematical novelette by [[Donald Knuth]].<ref>[http://discovermagazine.com/1995/dec/infinityplusonea599 Infinity Plus One, and Other Surreal Numbers] by Polly Shulman, [[Discover Magazine]], 1 December 1995</ref> He also invented a nomenclature for exceedingly [[large number]]s, the [[Conway chained arrow notation]]. Much of this is discussed in the 0th part of ''ONAG''.\n\n===Geometry===\nIn the mid-1960s with [[Michael Guy (computer scientist)|Michael Guy]], Conway established that there are sixty-four [[uniform polychoron|convex uniform polychora]] excluding two infinite sets of prismatic forms. They discovered the [[grand antiprism]] in the process, the only [[non-Wythoffian]] uniform [[polychoron]]. Conway has also suggested a system of notation dedicated to describing [[polyhedra]] called [[Conway polyhedron notation]].\n\nIn the theory of tessellations, he devised the [[Conway criterion]] which describes rules for deciding if a prototile will tile the plane.<ref name=rhoads>{{cite journal| doi=10.1016/j.cam.2004.05.002 | volume=174 | issue=2 | title=Planar tilings by polyominoes, polyhexes, and polyiamonds | year=2005 | journal=Journal of Computational and Applied Mathematics | pages=329\u2013353 | last1 = Rhoads | first1 = Glenn C.| bibcode=2005JCoAM.174..329R }}</ref>\n\nHe investigated lattices in higher dimensions, and was the first to determine the symmetry group of the [[Leech lattice]].\n\n===Geometric topology===\nIn knot theory, Conway formulated a new variation of the [[Alexander polynomial]] and produced a new invariant now called the Conway polynomial.<ref>[http://mathworld.wolfram.com/ConwayPolynomial.html Conway Polynomial] [[Wolfram MathWorld]]</ref> After lying dormant for more than a decade, this concept became central to work in the 1980s on the novel [[knot polynomial]]s.<ref>Livingston, Charles, Knot Theory (MAA Textbooks), 1993, {{ISBN|0883850273}}</ref> Conway further developed [[tangle theory]] and invented a system of notation for tabulating knots, nowadays known as [[Conway notation (knot theory)|Conway notation]], while correcting a number of errors in the 19th century knot tables and extending them to include all but four of the non-alternating primes with 11 crossings. See Topology Proceedings 7 (1982) 118.\n\n===Group theory===\nHe was the primary author of the ''[[ATLAS of Finite Groups]]'' giving properties of many [[finite simple group]]s. Working with his colleagues Robert Curtis and [[Simon P. Norton]] he constructed the first concrete representations of some of the [[sporadic group]]s. More specifically, he discovered three sporadic groups based on the symmetry of the [[Leech lattice]], which have been designated the [[Conway groups]].<ref name=harris>Harris (2015)</ref> This work made him a key player in the successful [[classification of the finite simple groups]].\n\nBased on a 1978 observation by mathematician [[John McKay (mathematician)|John McKay]], Conway and Norton formulated the complex of conjectures known as [[monstrous moonshine]]. This subject, named by Conway, relates the [[monster group]] with [[elliptic modular function]]s, thus bridging two previously distinct areas of mathematics\u2013[[finite group]]s and [[complex function theory]]. Monstrous moonshine theory has now been revealed to also have deep connections to [[string theory]].<ref>[http://www.daviddarling.info/encyclopedia/M/Monstrous_Moonshine_conjecture.html Monstrous Moonshine conjecture] David Darling: Encyclopedia of Science</ref>\n\nConway introduced the [[Mathieu groupoid]], an extension of the [[Mathieu group M12|Mathieu group M<sub>12</sub>]] to 13 points.\n\n===Number theory===\nAs a graduate student, he proved one case of a [[Waring's problem|conjecture]] by [[Edward Waring]], that in which every integer could be written as the sum of 37 numbers, each raised to the fifth power, though [[Chen Jingrun]] solved the problem independently before Conway's work could be published.<ref>[http://www.ems-ph.org/journals/newsletter/pdf/2005-09-57.pdf#page=34 Breakfast with John Horton Conway]</ref>\n\n===Algebra===\nConway has written textbooks and done original work in algebra, focusing particularly on [[quaternion]]s and [[octonion]]s.<ref>Conway and Smith (2003): \"Conway and Smith's book is a wonderful introduction to the normed division algebras: the real numbers, the complex numbers, the quaternions, and the octonions.\"</ref>  Together with [[Neil Sloane]], he invented the [[icosians]].<ref>{{cite web| url=http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/week20.html| title=This Week's Finds in Mathematical Physics (Week 20)| author=John Baez| date=2 October 1993}}</ref>\n\n===Analysis===\nHe invented a [[Conway base 13 function|base 13 function]] as a counterexample to the [[converse (logic)|converse]] of the [[intermediate value theorem]]: the function takes on every real value in each interval on the real line, so it has a [[Darboux property]] but is ''not'' [[continuous function|continuous]].\n\n===Algorithmics===\nFor calculating the day of the week, he invented the [[Doomsday algorithm]]. The algorithm is simple enough for anyone with basic arithmetic ability to do the calculations mentally. Conway can usually give the correct answer in under two seconds. To improve his speed, he practices his calendrical calculations on his computer, which is programmed to quiz him with random dates every time he logs on. One of his early books was on [[finite-state machine]]s.\n\n===Theoretical physics===\nIn 2004, Conway and [[Simon B. Kochen]], another Princeton mathematician, proved the [[free will theorem]], a startling version of the \"[[Hidden-variable theory|no hidden variables]]\" principle of [[quantum mechanics]]. It states that given certain conditions, if an experimenter can freely decide what quantities to measure in a particular experiment, then elementary particles must be free to choose their spins to make the measurements consistent with physical law. In Conway's provocative wording: \"if experimenters have [[free will]], then so do elementary particles.\"<ref>''[http://www.cs.auckland.ac.nz/~jas/one/freewill-theorem.html Conway's Proof Of The Free Will Theorem] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100516002546/http://www.cs.auckland.ac.nz/~jas/one/freewill-theorem.html |date=16 May 2010 }}'' by Jasvir Nagra</ref>\n\n==Awards and honours==\nConway received the [[Berwick Prizes|Berwick Prize]] (1971),<ref name=\"LMS Prizewinners\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.lms.ac.uk/prizes/list-lms-prize-winners|title=List of LMS prize winners &#124; London Mathematical Society|website=www.lms.ac.uk}}</ref> was elected a [[Fellow of the Royal Society]] (1981),<ref name=royal/> was the first recipient of the [[P\u00f3lya Prize (LMS)]] (1987),<ref name=\"LMS Prizewinners\"/> won the [[Nemmers Prize in Mathematics]] (1998) and received the [[Leroy P.
