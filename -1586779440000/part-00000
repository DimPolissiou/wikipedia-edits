Grateful Dead members have said that it was after attending a concert by the touring New York City band [[the Lovin' Spoonful]] that they decided to \"go electric\" and look for a dirtier sound. [[Jerry Garcia]] and [[Bob Weir]] (each of whom had been immersed in the [[American folk music revival]] of the late 1950s and early 1960s), were open-minded to electric guitars.\n\nThe Grateful Dead's early music (in the mid-1960s) was part of the process of establishing what \"[[psychedelic music]]\" was, but theirs was essentially a \"street party\" form of it. They developed their \"psychedelic\" playing as a result of meeting [[Ken Kesey]] in [[Palo Alto, California]], and subsequently becoming the house band for the [[Acid Tests]] he staged.<ref>[[Tom Wolfe|Wolfe, Tom]] (1968). ''[[The Electric Kool-Aid Acid Test]]'', Farrar Straus & Giroux</ref> They did not fit their music to an established category such as pop rock, blues, folk rock, or country & western. Individual tunes within their repertoire could be identified under one of these stylistic labels, but overall their music drew on all of these genres and, more frequently, melded several of them. [[Bill Graham (promoter)|Bill Graham]] said of the Grateful Dead, \"They're not the best at what they do, they're the only ones that do what they do.\"<ref>{{cite web|author=Bjerklie, Steve|url=http://www.metroactive.com/papers/sfmetro/03.97/rock-art-97-3.html|title=What are They Worth?|publisher=Metroactive.com|accessdate=July 16, 2011|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110515181358/http://www.metroactive.com/papers/sfmetro/03.97/rock-art-97-3.html|archivedate=May 15, 2011}}</ref> Often (both in performance and on recording) the Dead left room for exploratory, spacey soundscapes.\n\nTheir live shows, fed by an improvisational approach to music, were different from most touring bands. While rock and roll bands often rehearse a standard set, played with minor variations, the Grateful Dead did not prepare in this way. Garcia stated in a 1966 interview, \"We don't make up our sets beforehand. We'd rather work off the tops of our heads than off a piece of paper.\"<ref name=\"The Grateful Dead p. 17\">The Grateful Dead: Playing in the Band, David Gans and Peter Simon, St Martin Press, 1985 p. 17</ref> They maintained this approach throughout their career.

These records largely featured the band's laid-back [[acoustic music]]ianship and more traditional song structures.

Lesh, who was originally a classically trained trumpet player with an extensive background in music theory, did not tend to play traditional blues-based bass forms, but more melodic, symphonic and complex lines, often sounding like a second lead guitar. Weir, too, was not a traditional rhythm guitarist, but tended to play jazz-influenced, unique inversions at the upper end of the Dead's sound. The two drummers, [[Mickey Hart]] and Kreutzmann, developed a unique, complex interplay, balancing Kreutzmann's steady beat with Hart's interest in percussion styles outside the rock tradition. Hart incorporated an 11-count measure to his drumming, bringing a dimension to the band's sound that became an important part of its style.<ref>Cavallo, Dominick.

The band was also famous for its extended musical improvisations, having been described as having never played the same song the same way twice.

Stanley was the Grateful Dead's soundman for many years; he was also one of the largest suppliers of [[Lysergic acid diethylamide|LSD]].<ref>McNally, Dennis, \"A Long Strange Trip\", New York 2002, pp. 118\u201319. {{ISBN|0-7679-1185-7}} and Brightman, Carol, \"Sweet Chaos\", New York 1998, pp. 100\u201304. {{ISBN|0-671-01117-0}}</ref> Stanley's sound systems were delicate and finicky, and frequently brought shows to a halt with technical breakdowns. After Stanley went to jail for manufacturing LSD in 1970, the group briefly used house PAs, but found them to be even less reliable than those built by their former soundman. On February 2, 1970, the group contacted [[Bob Heil]] to use his system.<ref name=\"performing\">{{cite news|url=http://www.performing-musician.com/pm/dec08/articles/bobheil.htm?print=yes#top|title=The Night that Modern Live Sound Was Born: Bob Heil and the Grateful Dead|last=Daley|first=Dan|date=December 2008|publisher=Performing Musician|accessdate=May 7, 2011}}</ref> In 1971, the band purchased their first [[solid state (electronics)|solid-state]] sound system from [[Alembic Inc]] Studios. Because of this, Alembic would play an integral role in the research, development, and production of the Wall of Sound. The band also welcomed [[Dan Healy (soundman)|Dan Healy]] into the fold on a permanent basis that year. Healy would mix the Grateful Dead's live sound until 1993.\n\n===Tapes===\nLike several other bands during this time, the Grateful Dead allowed their fans to record their shows. For many years the [[Taper (concert)|tapers]] set up their microphones wherever they could, and the eventual forest of microphones became a problem for the sound crew. Eventually, this was solved by having a dedicated taping section located behind the [[Sound board (music)|soundboard]], which required a special \"tapers\" ticket. The band allowed sharing of tapes of their shows, as long as no profits were made on the sale of their show tapes.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/details/GratefulDead|title=Internet Archive: Grateful Dead|accessdate=July 16, 2011|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110719012925/http://www.archive.org/details/GratefulDead|archivedate=July 19, 2011}}</ref> Sometimes the sound crew would allow the tapers to connect directly to the soundboard, which created exceptional recordings.<ref name=\"Archive.org\">{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/iathreads/post-view.php?id=47634|title=Internet Archive Forums: Grateful Dead concert recordings on the Internet Archive|accessdate=February 25, 2015|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091001075250/http://www.archive.org/iathreads/post-view.php?id=47634|archivedate=October 1, 2009}}</ref>\n\nRecently, there have been some disputes over which recordings [[Internet Archive|archive.org]] could host on their site.

Sullivan's drawing was an illustration for a 1913 edition of the ''[[Rubaiyat of Omar Khayyam]]''. Earlier antecedents include the custom of exhibiting the relic skulls of Christian martyrs decorated with roses on their feast days. The rose is an attribute of [[Saint Valentine]], who according to one legend, was martyred by decapitation. Accordingly, in Rome, at the church dedicated to him, the observance of his feast day included the display of his skull surrounded by roses.<ref>{{cite book|title=Rome: A Holiday Magazine Travel Guide|publisher=Random House|location=New York|date=1960}}</ref> Kelley and Mouse's design originally appeared on a poster for the September 16 and 17, 1966, Dead shows at the [[Avalon Ballroom]].<ref>{{cite news|author=du Lac, J.

[[Bob Weir]], the youngest original member of the group, played [[rhythm guitar]]. [[Ron \"Pigpen\" McKernan]] played [[Hammond organ|keyboards]] and [[harmonica]] until shortly before his death in 1973 at the age of 27. Garcia, Weir, and McKernan shared the lead vocal duties more or less equally; Lesh only sang a few leads, but his tenor was a key part of the band's three-part vocal harmonies. [[Bill Kreutzmann]] played [[drum]]s, and in September 1967 was joined by a second drummer, New York City native [[Mickey Hart]], who also played a wide variety of other [[percussion instrument]]s.\n\n1970 included tour dates in [[New Orleans, Louisiana]], where the band performed at [[The Warehouse (New Orleans)|The Warehouse]] for two nights. On January 31, 1970, the local police raided their hotel on [[Bourbon Street]], and arrested and charged a total of 19 people with possession of various drugs.<ref>\"Drug Raid Nets 19 in French Quarter\", ''The Times-Picayune'', February 1, 1970</ref> The second night's concert was performed as scheduled after bail was posted. Eventually, the charges were dismissed, except those against sound engineer [[Owsley Stanley]], who was already facing charges in California for manufacturing LSD. This event was later memorialized in the lyrics of the song \"[[Truckin']]\", a single from ''American Beauty'' which reached number 64 on the charts.\n\nMickey Hart took time off from the Grateful Dead beginning in February 1971,<ref>{{cite web|last=Planer|first=Lindsay|url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/rolling-thunder-r102792/review|title=''Rolling Thunder:'' Review|work=AllMusic|accessdate=April 6, 2015}}</ref> leaving Kreutzmann once again as the sole percussionist. Hart rejoined the Grateful Dead for good in October 1974. [[Tom Constanten|Tom \"TC\" Constanten]] was added as a second keyboardist from 1968 to 1970, while Pigpen also played various percussion instruments and sang.\n\nAfter Constanten's departure, Pigpen reclaimed his position as sole keyboardist.

His drug habits caused him to lose his liveliness on stage. After beginning to curtail his opiate usage in 1985 gradually, Garcia slipped into a [[diabetic coma]] for several days in July 1986. After he recovered, the band released ''[[In the Dark (Grateful Dead album)|In the Dark]]'' in July 1987, which became their best selling studio album and produced their only top-10 single, \"[[Touch of Grey]]\". Also that year, the group [[Bob Dylan and Grateful Dead Tour 1987|toured]] with [[Bob Dylan]], as heard on the album ''[[Dylan & the Dead]]''.\n\nMydland died after the summer tour in 1990 and [[Vince Welnick]], former keyboardist for [[the Tubes]], joined as a band member, while [[Bruce Hornsby]], who had a successful career with his band the Range, joined as a touring member.

Grateful Dead members have said that it was after attending a concert by the touring New York City band [[the Lovin' Spoonful]] that they decided to \"go electric\" and look for a dirtier sound. [[Jerry Garcia]] and [[Bob Weir]] (each of whom had been immersed in the [[American folk music revival]] of the late 1950s and early 1960s), were open-minded to electric guitars.\n\nThe Grateful Dead's early music (in the mid-1960s) was part of the process of establishing what \"[[psychedelic music]]\" was, but theirs was essentially a \"street party\" form of it. They developed their \"psychedelic\" playing as a result of meeting [[Ken Kesey]] in [[Palo Alto, California]], and subsequently becoming the house band for the [[Acid Tests]] he staged.<ref>[[Tom Wolfe|Wolfe, Tom]] (1968). ''[[The Electric Kool-Aid Acid Test]]'', Farrar Straus & Giroux</ref> They did not fit their music to an established category such as pop rock, blues, folk rock, or country & western. Individual tunes within their repertoire could be identified under one of these stylistic labels, but overall their music drew on all of these genres and, more frequently, melded several of them. [[Bill Graham (promoter)|Bill Graham]] said of the Grateful Dead, \"They're not the best at what they do, they're the only ones that do what they do.\"<ref>{{cite web|author=Bjerklie, Steve|url=http://www.metroactive.com/papers/sfmetro/03.97/rock-art-97-3.html|title=What are They Worth?|publisher=Metroactive.com|accessdate=July 16, 2011|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110515181358/http://www.metroactive.com/papers/sfmetro/03.97/rock-art-97-3.html|archivedate=May 15, 2011}}</ref> Often (both in performance and on recording) the Dead left room for exploratory, spacey soundscapes.\n\nTheir live shows, fed by an improvisational approach to music, were different from most touring bands. While rock and roll bands often rehearse a standard set, played with minor variations, the Grateful Dead did not prepare in this way. Garcia stated in a 1966 interview, \"We don't make up our sets beforehand. We'd rather work off the tops of our heads than off a piece of paper.\"<ref name=\"The Grateful Dead p. 17\">The Grateful Dead: Playing in the Band, David Gans and Peter Simon, St Martin Press, 1985 p. 17</ref> They maintained this approach throughout their career.

These records largely featured the band's laid-back [[acoustic music]]ianship and more traditional song structures.

Lesh, who was originally a classically trained trumpet player with an extensive background in music theory, did not tend to play traditional blues-based bass forms, but more melodic, symphonic and complex lines, often sounding like a second lead guitar. Weir, too, was not a traditional rhythm guitarist, but tended to play jazz-influenced, unique inversions at the upper end of the Dead's sound. The two drummers, [[Mickey Hart]] and Kreutzmann, developed a unique, complex interplay, balancing Kreutzmann's steady beat with Hart's interest in percussion styles outside the rock tradition. Hart incorporated an 11-count measure to his drumming, bringing a dimension to the band's sound that became an important part of its style.<ref>Cavallo, Dominick.

After Stanley went to jail for manufacturing LSD in 1970, the group briefly used house PAs, but found them to be even less reliable than those built by their former soundman.

Because of this, Alembic would play an integral role in the research, development, and production of the Wall of Sound. The band also welcomed [[Dan Healy (soundman)|Dan Healy]] into the fold on a permanent basis that year. Healy would mix the Grateful Dead's live sound until 1993.\n\n===Tapes===\nLike several other bands during this time, the Grateful Dead allowed their fans to record their shows. For many years the [[Taper (concert)|tapers]] set up their microphones wherever they could, and the eventual forest of microphones became a problem for the sound crew. Eventually, this was solved by having a dedicated taping section located behind the [[Sound board (music)|soundboard]], which required a special \"tapers\" ticket. The band allowed sharing of tapes of their shows, as long as no profits were made on the sale of their show tapes.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/details/GratefulDead|title=Internet Archive: Grateful Dead|accessdate=July 16, 2011|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110719012925/http://www.archive.org/details/GratefulDead|archivedate=July 19, 2011}}</ref> Sometimes the sound crew would allow the tapers to connect directly to the soundboard, which created exceptional recordings.<ref name=\"Archive.org\">{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/iathreads/post-view.php?id=47634|title=Internet Archive Forums: Grateful Dead concert recordings on the Internet Archive|accessdate=February 25, 2015|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091001075250/http://www.archive.org/iathreads/post-view.php?id=47634|archivedate=October 1, 2009}}</ref>\n\nRecently, there have been some disputes over which recordings [[Internet Archive|archive.org]] could host on their site.

It was designed by [[Owsley Stanley]] and artist Bob Thomas, and was originally used as a logo to mark the band's equipment.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thebear.org/GDLogo.html|title=Creation of the lightning bolt skull, as told by Owsley \"Bear\" Stanley|publisher=Thebear.org|accessdate=July 16, 2011|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110716162431/http://www.thebear.org/GDLogo.html|archivedate=July 16, 2011}}</ref>\n\n;Dancing Terrapins\n:The two dancing [[terrapin]]s first appeared on the cover of the album ''[[Terrapin Station]]'' (1977).

Since then these turtles have become one of the Grateful Dead's most recognizable logos.{{citation needed|date=November 2015}}\n\n;Uncle Sam Skeleton\n:The Uncle Sam skeleton was devised by Gary Gutierrez as part of the animation for ''[[The Grateful Dead Movie]]'' (1977).<ref>McNally, p.&nbsp;499</ref> The image combines the Grateful Dead skeleton motif with the character of [[Uncle Sam]], a reference to the then-recently written song \"U.S. Blues\", which plays during the animation.\n\n==Deadheads==\n{{Main|Deadhead}}\nFans and enthusiasts of the band are commonly referred to as [[Deadhead]]s. While the origin of the term may be unclear, ''Dead Heads'' were made canon by the notice placed inside the ''[[Grateful Dead (album)|Skull and Roses]]'' (1971) album by manager Jon McIntire:\n\n{{quote|DEAD FREAKS UNITE: Who are you?

Smaller columns and walls are wrapped in [[detonating cord]]. The goal is to use as little explosive as possible so that the structure will fail in a [[progressive collapse]], and therefore only a few floors are rigged with explosives, so that it is safer due to fewer explosives, and costs less. The areas with explosives are covered in thick [[geotextile]] fabric and fencing to absorb flying debris.<ref name=\"Nova1\"/> Far more time-consuming than the demolition itself is the clean-up of the site, as the debris is loaded into trucks and hauled away.\n\n== Deconstruction ==\n{{main|Deconstruction (building)}}\nAn alternative approach to demolition is the deconstruction of a building with the goal of minimizing the amount of materials going to [[landfill]]s. This \"green\" approach is applied by removing the materials by type material and segregating them for reuse or [[recycling]]. With proper planning this approach has resulted in landfill diversion rates that exceed 90% of an entire building and its contents in some cases. It also vastly reduces the [[carbon dioxide emissions|CO<sub>2</sub> emissions]] of the removing of a building in comparison to demolition.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.wired.co.uk/news/archive/2013-01/15/japan-eco-demolition |title=Taisei Corporation's Tecorep reducing CO<sub>2</sub> emissions by 85% |access-date=26 August 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160415000721/http://www.wired.co.uk/news/archive/2013-01/15/japan-eco-demolition |archive-date=15 April 2016 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\nThe development of plant and equipment has allowed for the easier segregation of [[demolition waste]] types on site and the reuse within the construction of the replacement building. On site crushers allow the demolished concrete to be reused as type 1 crushed aggregate either as a piling mat for ground stabilization or as aggregate in the mixing of concrete.\n\nTimber waste can be shredded using specialist timber shredders and composted, or used to form manufactured timber boards, such as [[Medium-density fibreboard|MDF]] or [[Particle board|chipboard]].\n\nSafety is paramount; a site safety officer is usually assigned to each project to enforce all safety rules and regulations.\n\n{{Wide image|Mendham Demolition.jpg|1200px|alt=Sequence of images depicting demolition of the last grain elevator in Mendham, Saskatchewan, June 2009 | Demolition of the last [[grain elevator]] in [[Mendham, Saskatchewan]], June 2009}}\n\n== See also ==\n*[[Construction waste]]\n*[[Demolition waste]]\n*Excavator [[Ram guard]] (Protection of excavators used for demolition)\n*[[House demolition]] (military tactic)\n*[[ICE demolition protocol]]\n*[[List of demolished buildings and structures in London]]\n*[[National Federation of Demolition Contractors]] (UK)\n*[[Slighting]]\n*[[Teardown (real estate)]]\n*[[Urban renewal]]\n*[https://www.engineeringbrother.com/2020/04/Demolition-plan-of-building.html Demolition Plan]\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n{{commons category-inline|Demolitions}}\n{{wiktionary|demolition}}\n\n[[Category:Building engineering]]\n[[Category:Demolition| ]]\n", "text_old": "{{short description|Tearing-down of buildings and other structures}}\n{{Other uses}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=July 2013}}\n[[File:PerthOldMyerBuildingAnim gobeirne.gif|thumb|upright|The demolition of the [[Myer]] Building in [[Perth, Western Australia]].]]\n[[File:Qormi monuments 02.jpg|thumb|A partially demolished house in [[Qormi]], [[Malta]]]]\n\n'''Demolition''', or '''razing''', is the [[science]] and [[engineering]] in safely and efficiently tearing down of [[building]]s and other artificial [[structure]]s.

Hudson Department Store and Addition]] is the tallest steel framed building and largest single structure ever [[Building implosion|imploded]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.controlled-demolition.com/default.asp?reqLocId=7&reqItemId=20030225133807 |title=J.L. Hudson Department Store |publisher=Controlled Demolition, Inc.}}</ref>\n\n=== Preparation ===\nIt takes several weeks or months to prepare a building for implosion. All items of value, such as copper wiring, are stripped from a building. Some materials must be removed, such as [[glass]] that can form deadly projectiles, and insulation that can scatter over a wide area. Non-load bearing partitions and [[drywall]] are removed.<ref name = \"Nova1\">{{cite web |author=[[WGBH-TV|WGBH Boston]] |title=Interview with Stacey Loizeaux |url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/kaboom/loizeaux.html |work=[[Nova (American TV series)|NOVA Online]] |publisher=[[Public Broadcasting Service]] |date=December 1996 |accessdate=2009-04-29 |quote=She learned the fine art of demolition from her father, Mark Loizeaux, and her uncle, Doug Loizeaux\u2014president and vice-president of the company.

Smaller columns and walls are wrapped in [[detonating cord]]. The goal is to use as little explosive as possible so that the structure will fail in a [[progressive collapse]], and therefore only a few floors are rigged with explosives, so that it is safer due to fewer explosives, and costs less. The areas with explosives are covered in thick [[geotextile]] fabric and fencing to absorb flying debris.<ref name=\"Nova1\"/> Far more time-consuming than the demolition itself is the clean-up of the site, as the debris is loaded into trucks and hauled away.\n\n== Deconstruction ==\n{{main|Deconstruction (building)}}\nAn alternative approach to demolition is the deconstruction of a building with the goal of minimizing the amount of materials going to [[landfill]]s. This \"green\" approach is applied by removing the materials by type material and segregating them for reuse or [[recycling]]. With proper planning this approach has resulted in landfill diversion rates that exceed 90% of an entire building and its contents in some cases. It also vastly reduces the [[carbon dioxide emissions|CO<sub>2</sub> emissions]] of the removing of a building in comparison to demolition.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.wired.co.uk/news/archive/2013-01/15/japan-eco-demolition |title=Taisei Corporation's Tecorep reducing CO<sub>2</sub> emissions by 85% |access-date=26 August 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160415000721/http://www.wired.co.uk/news/archive/2013-01/15/japan-eco-demolition |archive-date=15 April 2016 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\nThe development of plant and equipment has allowed for the easier segregation of [[demolition waste]] types on site and the reuse within the construction of the replacement building. On site crushers allow the demolished concrete to be reused as type 1 crushed aggregate either as a piling mat for ground stabilization or as aggregate in the mixing of concrete.\n\nTimber waste can be shredded using specialist timber shredders and composted, or used to form manufactured timber boards, such as [[Medium-density fibreboard|MDF]] or [[Particle board|chipboard]].\n\nSafety is paramount; a site safety officer is usually assigned to each project to enforce all safety rules and regulations.\n\n{{Wide image|Mendham Demolition.jpg|1200px|alt=Sequence of images depicting demolition of the last grain elevator in Mendham, Saskatchewan, June 2009 | Demolition of the last [[grain elevator]] in [[Mendham, Saskatchewan]], June 2009}}\n\n== See also ==\n*[[Construction waste]]\n*[[Demolition waste]]\n*Excavator [[Ram guard]] (Protection of excavators used for demolition)\n*[[House demolition]] (military tactic)\n*[[ICE demolition protocol]]\n*[[List of demolished buildings and structures in London]]\n*[[National Federation of Demolition Contractors]] (UK)\n*[[Slighting]]\n*[[Teardown (real estate)]]\n*[[Urban renewal]]\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n{{commons category-inline|Demolitions}}\n{{wiktionary|demolition}}\n\n[[Category:Building engineering]]\n[[Category:Demolition| ]]\n", "name_user": "Suraj sorthiya5860", "label": "unsafe", "comment": "(\u2192\u200eSee also)", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demolition"}

His father was a [[cabinet-maker]]. One of his elder brothers had become a boxer under the name of Lou Lewis.  At the suggestion of a police officer \u2013 who had witnessed his performance in a street brawl \u2013 he entered the boxing ring in 1909, making his fighting debut as \u2018Kid\u2019 Lewis, having joined as a member of the Judaean Club, [[Whitechapel]] (the name \"Ted\" was added later, in America). He subsequently won the Club's [[Flyweight]] title and took home a cup of imitation silver.\n\nHe became a professional boxer in 1909. On 6 October 1913, Lewis won the British [[Featherweight]] Championship with a 17th-round knockout of Alec Lambert at London's [[National Sporting Club]]. A year later, on 2 February 1914, at London's Premierland (in [[Whitechapel]]), he won the European Featherweight title from the French boxer Paul Til via a 12th round foul. Still in 1914, campaigning as a [[lightweight]] and [[welterweight]], Lewis left London and toured [[Australia]]. In 1915 Lewis travelled to the [[United States]], fighting [[Phil Bloom]] in New York's [[Madison Square Garden]] and winning by a decision.\n\n=== Taking the world welterweight title; rivalry with Jack Britton ===\n\n[[File:Ted Kid Lewis and Jack Britton.jpg|left|thumb|Lewis (left), shaking hands with arch-rival [[Jack Britton]]]]\n\nIn [[Boston]]\u2019s Armory, on 31 August of that same year, he fought the man known as the \"Boxing Marvel,\" [[Jack Britton]], for the Welterweight title. Lewis won in a twelve-round decision, becoming World Welterweight Champion and beginning an historic rivalry. Lewis became the first English boxer to cross the Atlantic and beat an American for a world title.  \n\nThe fights between Lewis and Britton for the world title were particularly notable. Their relationship has been described as one of the greatest rivalries in boxing history, and it was said that \u2018they winced and ducked every time they heard the other man\u2019s name\u2019. From 1915 to 1921 Lewis and Britton fought 20 times, a total of 224 rounds. \n\nOn 24 April 1916, in [[New Orleans]], Lewis lost the title to Britton. He reclaimed it on 25 June 1917, at Westwood Field, [[Dayton, Ohio]]. He lost the title for the last time on 17 March 1919, in [[Canton, Ohio]], when Britton knocked him out in the 9th round \u2014 the only knockout of the series. The roundup of his matches with Britton:  Lewis won 3, lost 4, and had 1 draw. There were 12 no decisions. After his last loss to Britton, Lewis returned to England.\n\n=== Taking the British and European welterweight titles ===\nOn 9 June 1920, at London's Olympia Exhibition Centre, he beat [[Johnny Basham]] to win the British and European Welterweight titles. He relinquished these in December of that year due to difficulty in making the weight. His drive to fight [[Georges Carpentier]], World and European [[Light Heavyweight]] Champion, came to fruition on 11 May 1922, in the Olympia. Lewis, fighting at 150 pounds to Carpentier's 175, spent most of the first round giving the heavier man a drubbing. Then referee Joe Palmer put a hand on Lewis's shoulder to warn him against holding. Carpentier took advantage of this distraction and sneaked in a vicious right. The Kid went crashing to the canvas and was counted out. The Olympia crowd erupted furiously, crying, \"foul,\" but to no avail. The Kid remained nonplussed. \"I felt cheated, but I didn\u2019t bear any grudge,\" he would later say.\n\n=== Taking the British and European middleweight titles ===\nOn 6 June 1922, at Holland Park Rink, London, Lewis knocked out [[Frankie Burns]] to win the British [[Middleweight]] title. On 11 November the same year, also at Holland Park Rink, he beat Roland Todd to win the European Middleweight title. He did not hold either title long, losing both at the [[Royal Albert Hall]] on 15 February 1923 after a gruelling rematch with Todd.\n\nLewis won his last two titles, the British and European Welterweight crowns, on 3 July 1924 \u2014 again at London's Royal Albert Hall \u2014 by defeating [[Johnny Brown (Scottish boxer)|Johnny Brown]]. Two years later, on 26 November 1924, at Waverley Market Hall in [[Edinburgh]], he lost these championships to the much younger [[Scotsman]], Tommy Milligan. He continued boxing until 1929, adding 20 more fights. \n\nHis final record counting newspaper decisions was: 299 bouts, 233 won, 41 lost, 25 draws, 65 no decisions, 80 knockouts. Lewis started his career as an evasive, defensive boxer with a long left. During the six years he spent in America he changed his style radically, becoming a very aggressive, swarming, combination boxer-fighter.\n\n==Professional boxing

Over the course of his career, he had lost only 41 times. He then announced his retirement from boxing and settled back in his native east [[London]]. \n\nHis success in America had also made Lewis very famous at home in the UK and he had become an international celebrity. He met his future wife Elsie Schneider in New York, and became a close friend of [[Charlie Chaplin]], who would act as godfather to Lewis' son Morton. Lewis tried his hand in the movies, predominantly tackling boxing pictures. Inevitably, he was [[typecasting (acting)|typecast]]: not only was Lewis best known as a fighter, he also looked like one, with many years of punishment having left their mark on his face.\n\nMuch to the dismay of friends and family, he later acted as a bodyguard for [[Oswald Mosley]]'s [[New Party (UK)|New Party]] and was also persuaded to stand in the [[1931 United Kingdom general election|1931 general election]] as a candidate for the party in his local [[Whitechapel and St Georges (UK Parliament constituency)|Whitechapel and St Georges constituency]]; he polled only 154 votes. However, Lewis fell out with Mosley when his subsequent political movement, the [[British Union of Fascists]] revealed itself as openly [[anti-Semitic]].<ref name=Pottins>{{cite web |author=Charlie Pottins|title=BOOK REVIEW The Man Who Might Have Been |url=http://www.jewishsocialist.org.uk/reviews/item/the-man-who-might-have-been|publisher= |work=Jewish Socialist |date=Spring 2007}} </ref> After the defeat of 1931, Mosley embraced European-style fascism and founded the British Union of Fascists in 1932. Among other things, this saw him move towards more open anti-Semitism, particularly in Lewis' native East London. In his biography of his father, Morton Lewis describes how he was taken along by his father when he went to quit Mosley's movement. It involves Lewis violently arguing with Mosley and a pair of his henchmen at their headquarters, leaving the former reeling on the ground and the other two out cold. Then, after leaving, Lewis is described as returning to the building on a whim and knocking out two more of Mosley's guards without provocation.\n\nRestless in his career choices, he worked as a boxing trainer and manager, a gambling [[bookmaker]], a [[haberdasher]], a purveyor of wines and spirits, a boxing referee, a security officer, a travel agent and he also made numerous personal appearances, trading on his celebrity.  He stayed married to his wife Elsie for forty-five years until her death.<ref name=\"Blady\"/> \n\nDuring the early 1960s, Lewis was befriended by the notorious [[Kray twins]]; the boxing-infatuated gangland bosses enjoyed bringing the famous old champion to their parties and charity evenings, and they even used him as a decoy when arranging the escape of a fellow criminal from [[Dartmoor prison]].\n\nIn his final years, after his wife died, he was afflicted with failing eyesight and [[Parkinson's disease]]. From 1966 he lived comfortably in a south London retirement home for the Jewish elderly, Nightingale House in [[Clapham]]. He died there in October 1970.<ref name=\"Blady\">Blady, Ken, ''The Jewish Boxer's Hall of Fame'', (1988), Shapolsky Publishing, New York, New York, pps.264-74</ref> In 2003, an [[English Heritage]] [[blue plaque]] was erected at Nightingale House in his honour, which was unveiled by his son, Morton.\n\n== See also ==\n*[[List of welterweight boxing champions]]\n*[[List of Jews in sports#Boxers|List of select Jewish boxers]]\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n== Further reading ==\n*Bert Randolph Sugar, ''The 100 Greatest Boxers of all Time'', 1984, A Rutledge Book published by Bonanza, Crown Publishers, pp.&nbsp;88\u201389.\n*Nat Fleischer and Sam Andre, updated by Dan Rafael, ''An Illustrated History of Boxing'', 2001 Edition, Citadel Press, pp.&nbsp;262, 264, 265.\n*Morton Lewis, ''Ted \"Kid\" Lewis, His Life and Times'', 1990, Robson Books, LTD, Great Britain.\n\n== External links ==\n*{{boxrec|id=011911}}\n*[http://www.cyberboxingzone.com/boxing/lewis-t.htm Cyber Boxing Zone - Ted \"Kid\" Lewis]\n*[http://www.ibhof.com/pages/about/inductees/oldtimer/lewisted.html IBHOF Bio - Ted Kid Lewis]\n*{{IMDb name|0507791|Ted 'Kid' Lewis}}\n\n{{s-start}}\n{{s-ach|ach}}\n{{s-bef| rows = 2 | before=[[Jack Britton]]}}\n{{s-ttl| title=World Welterweight Champion |years=31 August 1915 &ndash;

His father was a [[cabinet-maker]]. One of his elder brothers had become a boxer under the name of Lou Lewis.  At the suggestion of a police officer \u2013 who had witnessed his performance in a street brawl \u2013 he entered the boxing ring in 1909, making his fighting debut as \u2018Kid\u2019 Lewis, having joined as a member of the Judaean Club, [[Whitechapel]] (the name \"Ted\" was added later, in America). He subsequently won the Club's [[Flyweight]] title and took home a cup of imitation silver.\n\nHe became a professional boxer in 1909. On 6 October 1913, Lewis won the British [[Featherweight]] Championship with a 17th-round knockout of Alec Lambert at London's [[National Sporting Club]]. A year later, on 2 February 1914, at London's Premierland (in [[Whitechapel]]), he won the European Featherweight title from the French boxer Paul Til via a 12th round foul. Still in 1914, campaigning as a [[lightweight]] and [[welterweight]], Lewis left London and toured [[Australia]]. In 1915 Lewis travelled to the [[United States]], fighting [[Phil Bloom]] in New York's [[Madison Square Garden]] and winning by a decision.\n\n=== Taking the world welterweight title; rivalry with Jack Britton ===\n\n[[File:Ted Kid Lewis and Jack Britton.jpg|left|thumb|Lewis (left), shaking hands with arch-rival [[Jack Britton]]]]\n\nIn [[Boston]]\u2019s Armory, on 31 August of that same year, he fought the man known as the \"Boxing Marvel,\" [[Jack Britton]], for the Welterweight title. Lewis won in a twelve-round decision, becoming World Welterweight Champion and beginning an historic rivalry. Lewis became the first English boxer to cross the Atlantic and beat an American for a world title.  \n\nThe fights between Lewis and Britton for the world title were particularly notable. Their relationship has been described as one of the greatest rivalries in boxing history, and it was said that \u2018they winced and ducked every time they heard the other man\u2019s name\u2019. From 1915 to 1921 Lewis and Britton fought 20 times, a total of 224 rounds. \n\nOn 24 April 1916, in [[New Orleans]], Lewis lost the title to Britton. He reclaimed it on 25 June 1917, at Westwood Field, [[Dayton, Ohio]]. He lost the title for the last time on 17 March 1919, in [[Canton, Ohio]], when Britton knocked him out in the 9th round \u2014 the only knockout of the series. The roundup of his matches with Britton:  Lewis won 3, lost 4, and had 1 draw. There were 12 no decisions. After his last loss to Britton, Lewis returned to England.\n\n=== Taking the British and European welterweight titles ===\nOn 9 June 1920, at London's Olympia Exhibition Centre, he beat [[Johnny Basham]] to win the British and European Welterweight titles. He relinquished these in December of that year due to difficulty in making the weight. His drive to fight [[Georges Carpentier]], World and European [[Light Heavyweight]] Champion, came to fruition on 11 May 1922, in the Olympia. Lewis, fighting at 150 pounds to Carpentier's 175, spent most of the first round giving the heavier man a drubbing. Then referee Joe Palmer put a hand on Lewis's shoulder to warn him against holding. Carpentier took advantage of this distraction and sneaked in a vicious right. The Kid went crashing to the canvas and was counted out. The Olympia crowd erupted furiously, crying, \"foul,\" but to no avail. The Kid remained nonplussed. \"I felt cheated, but I didn\u2019t bear any grudge,\" he would later say.\n\n=== Taking the British and European middleweight titles ===\nOn 6 June 1922, at Holland Park Rink, London, Lewis knocked out [[Frankie Burns]] to win the British [[Middleweight]] title. On 11 November the same year, also at Holland Park Rink, he beat Roland Todd to win the European Middleweight title. He did not hold either title long, losing both at the [[Royal Albert Hall]] on 15 February 1923 after a gruelling rematch with Todd.\n\nLewis won his last two titles, the British and European Welterweight crowns, on 3 July 1924 \u2014 again at London's Royal Albert Hall \u2014 by defeating [[Johnny Brown (Scottish boxer)|Johnny Brown]]. Two years later, on 26 November 1924, at Waverley Market Hall in [[Edinburgh]], he lost these championships to the much younger [[Scotsman]], Tommy Milligan. He continued boxing until 1929, adding 20 more fights. \n\nHis final record counting newspaper decisions was: 299 bouts, 233 won, 41 lost, 25 draws, 65 no decisions, 80 knockouts. Lewis started his career as an evasive, defensive boxer with a long left. During the six years he spent in America he changed his style radically, becoming a very aggressive, swarming, combination boxer-fighter.\n\n==Professional boxing

Over the course of his career, he had lost only 41 times. He then announced his retirement from boxing and settled back in his native east [[London]]. \n\nHis success in America had also made Lewis very famous at home in the UK and he had become an international celebrity. He met his future wife Elsie Schneider in New York, and became a close friend of [[Charlie Chaplin]], who would act as godfather to Lewis' son Morton. Lewis tried his hand in the movies, predominantly tackling boxing pictures. Inevitably, he was [[typecasting (acting)|typecast]]: not only was Lewis best known as a fighter, he also looked like one, with many years of punishment having left their mark on his face.\n\nMuch to the dismay of friends and family, he later acted as a bodyguard for [[Oswald Mosley]]'s [[New Party (UK)|New Party]] and was also persuaded to stand in the [[1931 United Kingdom general election|1931 general election]] as a candidate for the party in his local [[Whitechapel and St Georges (UK Parliament constituency)|Whitechapel and St Georges constituency]]; he polled only 154 votes. However, Lewis fell out with Mosley when his subsequent political movement, the [[British Union of Fascists]] revealed itself as openly [[anti-Semitic]].<ref name=Pottins>{{cite web |author=Charlie Pottins|title=BOOK REVIEW The Man Who Might Have Been |url=http://www.jewishsocialist.org.uk/reviews/item/the-man-who-might-have-been|publisher= |work=Jewish Socialist |date=Spring 2007}} </ref> After the defeat of 1931, Mosley embraced European-style fascism and founded the British Union of Fascists in 1932. Among other things, this saw him move towards more open anti-Semitism, particularly in Lewis' native East London. In his biography of his father, Morton Lewis describes how he was taken along by his father when he went to quit Mosley's movement. It involves Lewis violently arguing with Mosley and a pair of his henchmen at their headquarters, leaving the former reeling on the ground and the other two out cold. Then, after leaving, Lewis is described as returning to the building on a whim and knocking out two more of Mosley's guards without provocation.\n\nRestless in his career choices, he worked as a boxing trainer and manager, a gambling [[bookmaker]], a [[haberdasher]], a purveyor of wines and spirits, a boxing referee, a security officer, a travel agent and he also made numerous personal appearances, trading on his celebrity.  He stayed married to his wife Elsie for forty-five years until her death.<ref name=\"Blady\"/> \n\nDuring the early 1960s, Lewis was befriended by the notorious [[Kray twins]]; the boxing-infatuated gangland bosses enjoyed bringing the famous old champion to their parties and charity evenings, and they even used him as a decoy when arranging the escape of a fellow criminal from [[Dartmoor prison]].\n\nIn his final years, after his wife died, he was afflicted with failing eyesight and [[Parkinson's disease]]. From 1966 he lived comfortably in a south London retirement home for the Jewish elderly, Nightingale House in [[Clapham]]. He died there in October 1970.<ref name=\"Blady\">Blady, Ken, ''The Jewish Boxer's Hall of Fame'', (1988), Shapolsky Publishing, New York, New York, pps.264-74</ref> In 2003, an [[English Heritage]] [[blue plaque]] was erected at Nightingale House in his honour, which was unveiled by his son, Morton.\n\n== See also ==\n*[[List of welterweight boxing champions]]\n*[[List of Jews in sports#Boxers|List of select Jewish boxers]]\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n== Further reading ==\n*Bert Randolph Sugar, ''The 100 Greatest Boxers of all Time'', 1984, A Rutledge Book published by Bonanza, Crown Publishers, pp.&nbsp;88\u201389.\n*Nat Fleischer and Sam Andre, updated by Dan Rafael, ''An Illustrated History of Boxing'', 2001 Edition, Citadel Press, pp.&nbsp;262, 264, 265.\n*Morton Lewis, ''Ted \"Kid\" Lewis, His Life and Times'', 1990, Robson Books, LTD, Great Britain.\n\n== External links ==\n*{{boxrec|id=011911}}\n*[http://www.cyberboxingzone.com/boxing/lewis-t.htm Cyber Boxing Zone - Ted \"Kid\" Lewis]\n*[http://www.ibhof.com/pages/about/inductees/oldtimer/lewisted.html IBHOF Bio - Ted Kid Lewis]\n*{{IMDb name|0507791|Ted 'Kid' Lewis}}\n\n{{s-start}}\n{{s-ach|ach}}\n{{s-bef| rows = 2 | before=[[Jack Britton]]}}\n{{s-ttl| title=World Welterweight Champion |years=31 August 1915 &ndash; 24 April 1916}}\n{{s-aft| rows = 2 |after=[[Jack Britton]]}}\n|-\n{{s-ttl| title=World Welterweight Champion |years=25 June 1917 &ndash; 17 March 1919}}\n|-\n{{s-end}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Lewis, Ted}}\n[[Category:1894 births]]\n[[Category:1970 deaths]]\n[[Category:English male boxers]]\n[[Category:English Jews]]\n[[Category:European Boxing Union champions]]\n[[Category:Featherweight boxers]]\n[[Category:International Boxing Hall of Fame inductees]]\n[[Category:Jewish boxers]]\n[[Category:Boxers from Greater London]]\n[[Category:Welterweight boxers]]\n[[Category:World boxing champions]]\n[[Category:World welterweight boxing champions]]\n[[Category:Jewish British sportspeople]]\n", "name_user": "Rodw", "label": "safe", "comment": "Disambiguating links toMike Glover(link changed toMike Glover (boxer); link changed toMike Glover (boxer)) usingDisamAssist.", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ted_%22Kid%22_Lewis"}

These men were sent, ostensibly, to set up [[coconut]] farming in Kerala. Another version of the story says that the Sri Lankan king sent eight martial families to Kerala at the request of a Chera king to quell a civil war that had erupted in Kerala against him.<ref name=\"ezh9\"/>{{clarify|reason=please can we see a translation of the relevant content on the talk page&nbsp;\u2014 thanks.|date=October 2011}}\n\n===Social and religious divergence===\nIt has been suggested that the Ezhavas may share a common heritage with the [[Nair]] caste. This theory is based on similarities between numerous of the customs adopted by the two groups, particularly with regard to marking various significant life stages such as childbirth and death, as well as their matrilineal practices and martial history. Oral history, folk songs and other old writings indicate that the Ezhavas were at some point in the past members of the armed forces serving various kings, including the [[Zamorin]]s of [[Kozhikode|Calicut]] and the rulers of the [[Cochin dynasty]]. [[Cyriac Pullapilly]] has said that only a common parentage can explain some of these issues.<ref name=\"Smith1976pp26-30\">[[#Smith1976|Pullapilly (1976)]] pp. 26\u201330</ref>\n\nA theory has been proposed for the origins of the [[Caste system in Kerala|caste system in the Kerala region]] based on the actions of the Aryan [[Jain]]s introducing such distinctions prior to the 8th-century AD. This argues that the Jains needed protection when they arrived in the area and recruited sympathetic local people to provide it. These people were then distinguished from others in the local population by their occupation as protectors, with the others all being classed as out-caste. Pullapilly describes that this meant they \"... were given ''kshatriya'' functions, but only ''shudra'' status. Thus originated the Nairs.\" The Ezhavas, not being among the group protecting the Jains, became out-castes.<ref name=\"Smith1976pp26-30\"/>\n\nAn alternate theory states that the system was introduced by the [[Nambudiri]] Brahmins. Although Brahmin influences had existed in the area since at least the 1st-century AD, there was a large influx from around the 8th-century when they acted as priests, counsellors and ministers to invading Aryan princes. At the time of their arrival the non-aboriginal local population had been converted to Buddhism by missionaries who had come from the north of India and from Ceylon. The Brahmins used their symbiotic relationship with the invading forces to assert their beliefs and position. Buddhist temples and monasteries were either destroyed or taken over for use in Hindu practices, thus undermining the ability of the Buddhists to propagate their beliefs.<ref name=\"Smith1976pp26-30\"/>\n\nThe Buddhist tradition of the Ezhavas, and the refusal to give it up, pushed them to an outcaste role within the greater Brahminic society.<ref name=\"Smith1976pp26-30\"/><ref>{{cite book | url = https://books.google.com/?id=A6MfPh-9DiEC&pg=PA25#PPA18,M1 | page = 18 | title = On life and times of George Joseph, 1887\u20131938, a Syrian Christian nationalist from Kerala | author = Joseph, George Gheverghese | publisher = Orient Longman | year = 2003 | accessdate = 2007-12-09 | isbn=978-81-250-2495-8}}</ref> This tradition is still evident as Ezhavas show greater interest in the moral, non-ritualistic, and non-dogmatic aspects of the religion rather than the theological.<ref name=\"Smith1976pp26-30\"/>\n\n==Past occupations==\nThe social anthropologists Filippo and Caroline Osella say that the Ezhavas \"...&nbsp;consisted in the mid-nineteenth century of a small landowning and titled elite and a large mass of landless and small tenants who were largely illiterate, considered untouchable, and who eked out a living by manual labour and petty trade.\"<ref name=\"Osella8\">{{cite book |title=Social Mobility in Kerala: Modernity and Identity in Conflict |first1=Filippo |last1=Osella |first2=Caroline |last2=Osella |publisher=Pluto Press |year=2000 |isbn=978-0-7453-1693-2 |page=8 |url=https://books.google.com.au/books?id=rMRw0gTZSJwC&pg=PA8}}</ref>{{efn|Gough describes Thiyya subtenants in Central Travancore, who worked land held by the Nair caste.

This activity is sometimes erroneously referred to as ''toddy tapping'', toddy being a liquor manufactured from the sap. Arrack was another liquor produced from the palms, as was jaggery (an unrefined sugar). In reality, most Ezhavas were agricultural labourers and small-time cultivators, with a substantial number diverging into the production of [[coir]] products, such as coconut mats for flooring, from towards the end of the 19th century.<ref name=\"Nossiter1982p30\"/> The coastal town of [[Alleppey]] became the centre of such manufacture and was mostly controlled by Ezhavas, although the lucrative export markets were accessible only through European traders, who monopolised the required equipment. A boom in trade for these manufactured goods after [[World War I]] led to a unique situation in twentieth-century Kerala whereby there was a shortage of labour, which attracted still more Ezhavas to the industry from outlying rural areas. The [[Great Depression]] impacted in particular on the export trade, causing a reduction in price and in wages even though production increased, with the consequence that during the 1930s many Ezhava families found themselves to be in dire financial circumstances.<ref name=\"Osella50\" /><ref>{{cite book |title=Communal Road to a Secular Kerala |first=George |last=Mathew |publisher=Concept Publishing Company |year=1989 |isbn=978-81-7022-282-8 |pages=137\u2013138 |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=1TuPeXFP0WgC&pg=PA137}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |title='Destroy Capitalism!': Growing Solidarity of Alleppey's Coir Workers, 1930\u201340 |first=Robin |last=Jeffrey |authorlink=Robin Jeffrey |journal=Economic and Political Weekly |volume=19 |issue=29 |pages=1159\u20131165 |date=21 July 1984 |jstor=4373437}} {{subscription required}}</ref>\n\nSome Ezhavas were involved in weaving and ship making.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=bVgeAAAAMAAJ&dq=jaggery+izhava&q=jaggery|title= Religion and ideology in Kerala |page=246|first=Genevi\u00e8ve |last=Lemercinier|publisher=D.K.

This is also known as Pandavarkali, which means the play of the Pandavas, (the five heroes of the ''[[Mahabharatha]]''), and is performed by Asari, Moosari, Karuvan, Thattan and Kallasari communities. This ritualistic dance is performed beneath a decorated pandal with a [[nilavilakku]] at its centre.

Arjuna nritham is also called \"Mayilpeeli Thookkam\" as the costume includes a characteristic garment made of mayilppeeli ([[peacock]] feathers). This garment is worn around the waist in a similar fashion as the \"uduthukettu\" of [[Kathakali]]. The various dance movements are closely similar to [[Kalarippayattu]] techniques. The performers have their faces painted green and wear distinctive headgears.  The all night performance of the dance form is usually presented solo or in pairs.<ref name = \"ezh22\"/>\n\n===Makachuttu===\nMakachuttu art is popular among Ezhavas in [[Thiruvananthapuram]] and Chirayinkizhu taluks and in [[Kilimanoor]], Pazhayakunnummal and Thattathumala regions. In this, a group of eight performers, two each, twin around each other like serpents and rise up, battling with sticks. The techniques are repeated several times.

Those living in southern [[Travancore]] tended to meld the different practices that existed in the other parts of Kerala. The family arrangements of northern [[Malabar (Northern Kerala)|Malabar]] were matrilineal with patrilocal property arrangements, whereas in northern Travancore they were matrilineal but usually matrilocal in their arrangements for property. Southern Malabar saw a patrilineal system but partible property.<ref name=\"Nossiter1982p30\"/>\n\nThese arrangements were reformed by legislation, for Malabar in 1925 and for Travancore in 1933. The process of reform was more easily achieved for the Ezhavas than it was for the [[Nair]]s, another [[Caste system in India|Hindu caste]] in Kerala who adopted matrilineal arrangements; the situation for the Nairs was complicated by a traditional matrilocal form of living called ''[[tharavadu|taravadu]]'' and by their usually much higher degree of property ownership.<ref name=\"Nossiter1982p30\"/>\n\n===Thiyyar Marriage===\n\n[[Edgar Thurston]] has described Thiyyar wedding in his [[Castes and Tribes of Southern India]] as\n\n\"The South Malabar Tiyan bridegroom, dressed as if for a wrestling match, with his cloth tied tight about his loins, carries a sword and shield, and is escorted by two companions similarly equipped, dancing their way along. The Izhuvan does not carry a sword under any circumstances. The chief feature of his wedding ceremony is a singing match. This, called the vatil-tura-pattu, or open the door song, assumes the form of a contest between the parties of the bridegroom and bride. The story of Krishna and his wife Rukmini is supposed to be alluded to. We have seen it all under slightly different colour at Conjeeveram. Krishna asks Rukmini to open the door, and admit him. She refuses, thinking he has been gallivanting with some other lady. He beseeches ; she refuses. He explains, and at length she yields. The song is more or less extem- pore, and each \"side must be ready with an immediate answer. The side which is reduced to the extremity of having no answer is beaten and under ignominy. Marriage is strictly forbidden between two persons belonging to the same illam. The bride and bridegroom must belong to different illams. In fact, the illams are exogamous. The following formula is repeated by the headman of the bride's party. Translated as accurately as possible, it runs thus. \"The tara and changati of both sides having met and consulted ; the astrologer having fixed an auspicious day after examining the star and porutham ; permission having been obtained from the tara, the relations, the illam and kulam, the father, uncle, and the brothers, and from the eight and four (twelve illams) and the six and four (ten kiriyams) ; the conji and adayalam ceremonies and the four tazhus having been performed, let me perform the kanjikudi ceremony for the marriage of ....

This was named after [[Narayana Guru]], who had established an ''[[ashram]]'' from where he preached his message of \"one caste, one religion, one god\" and a Sanskritised version of the Victorian concept of self-help. His influence locally has been compared to that of [[Swami Vivekananda]].<ref name=\"Nossiter1982pp30-32\" /> One of the initial aims of the SNDP was to campaign for the removal of the restrictions on school entry but even after those legal barriers to education were removed, it was uncommon in practice for Ezhavas to be admitted to government schools. Thus, the campaign shifted to providing schools operated by the community itself.<ref name=\"Padmanabhan\" /> The organisation, attracted support in Travancore but similar bodies in Cochin were less successful.

The [[Vaikom Satyagraha]] of 1924\u20131925 was a failed attempt to use the issue of ''[[avarna]]'' access to roads around temples in order to revive the fortunes of [[Indian National Congress|Congress]], orchestrated by [[T. K. Madhavan]], a revolutionary and civil rights activist,<ref name=\"Smith1976p38\">[[#Smith1976|Pullapilly (1976)]] p. 38</ref> and with a famous temple at [[Vaikom]] as the focal point. Although it failed in its stated aim of achieving access, the [[satyagraha]] (movement) did succeed in voicing a \"radical rhetoric\", according to Nossiter.<ref name=\"Nossiter1982pp30-32\"/> During this movement, a few [[Khalsa|Akalis]]\u2014an order of armed [[Sikh]]s\u2014came to Vaikom in support of the demonstrators. After the eventual passing of the [[Temple Entry Proclamation]], some of the Akalis remained.

Membership had reached 50,000 by 1928 and 60,000 by 1974, but Nossiter notes that, \"From the Vaikom ''satyagraha'' onwards the SNDP had stirred the ordinary Ezhava without materially improving his position.\" The division in the 1920s of 60,000 acres of properties previously held by substantial landowners saw the majority of Ezhava beneficiaries receive less than 1 acre each, although 2% of them took at least 40% of the available land. There was subsequently a radicalization and much political infighting within the leadership as a consequence of the effects of the [[Great Depression]] on the coir industry but the general notion of self-help was not easy to achieve in a primarily agricultural environment; the Victorian concept presumed an industrialised economy. The organisation lost members to various other groups, including the communist movement, and it was not until the 1950s that it reinvented itself as a pressure group and provider of educational opportunities along the lines of the [[Nair Service Society]] (NSS), Just as the NSS briefly formed the National Democratic Party in the 1970s in an attempt directly to enter the political arena, so too in 1972 the SNDP formed the Social Revolutionary Party.<ref name=\"Nossiter1982pp30-32\"/>\n\n==Position in society==\nThey were considered as ''avarna'' (outside brahmanical varna system) by the Nambudiri Brahmins who formed the Hindu clergy and ritual ruling elite in late medieval Kerala.<ref name=\"Nossiter1982p30\"/> [[Kathleen Gough]] says that the Thiyyas of Central Travancore were historically the highest-ranking of the \"higher polluting castes\", a group whose other constituents included [[Kanisan]]s and various artisanal castes, and who were all superior in status to the \"lower polluting castes\", such as the [[Pulayar]]s and [[Paraiyar]]s.

These men were sent, ostensibly, to set up [[coconut]] farming in Kerala. Another version of the story says that the Sri Lankan king sent eight martial families to Kerala at the request of a Chera king to quell a civil war that had erupted in Kerala against him.<ref name=\"ezh9\"/>{{clarify|reason=please can we see a translation of the relevant content on the talk page&nbsp;\u2014 thanks.|date=October 2011}}\n\n===Social and religious divergence===\nIt has been suggested that the Ezhavas may share a common heritage with the [[Nair]] caste. This theory is based on similarities between numerous of the customs adopted by the two groups, particularly with regard to marking various significant life stages such as childbirth and death, as well as their matrilineal practices and martial history. Oral history, folk songs and other old writings indicate that the Ezhavas were at some point in the past members of the armed forces serving various kings, including the [[Zamorin]]s of [[Kozhikode|Calicut]] and the rulers of the [[Cochin dynasty]]. [[Cyriac Pullapilly]] has said that only a common parentage can explain some of these issues.<ref name=\"Smith1976pp26-30\">[[#Smith1976|Pullapilly (1976)]] pp. 26\u201330</ref>\n\nA theory has been proposed for the origins of the [[Caste system in Kerala|caste system in the Kerala region]] based on the actions of the Aryan [[Jain]]s introducing such distinctions prior to the 8th-century AD. This argues that the Jains needed protection when they arrived in the area and recruited sympathetic local people to provide it. These people were then distinguished from others in the local population by their occupation as protectors, with the others all being classed as out-caste. Pullapilly describes that this meant they \"... were given ''kshatriya'' functions, but only ''shudra'' status. Thus originated the Nairs.\" The Ezhavas, not being among the group protecting the Jains, became out-castes.<ref name=\"Smith1976pp26-30\"/>\n\nAn alternate theory states that the system was introduced by the [[Nambudiri]] Brahmins. Although Brahmin influences had existed in the area since at least the 1st-century AD, there was a large influx from around the 8th-century when they acted as priests, counsellors and ministers to invading Aryan princes. At the time of their arrival the non-aboriginal local population had been converted to Buddhism by missionaries who had come from the north of India and from Ceylon. The Brahmins used their symbiotic relationship with the invading forces to assert their beliefs and position. Buddhist temples and monasteries were either destroyed or taken over for use in Hindu practices, thus undermining the ability of the Buddhists to propagate their beliefs.<ref name=\"Smith1976pp26-30\"/>\n\nThe Buddhist tradition of the Ezhavas, and the refusal to give it up, pushed them to an outcaste role within the greater Brahminic society.<ref name=\"Smith1976pp26-30\"/><ref>{{cite book | url = https://books.google.com/?id=A6MfPh-9DiEC&pg=PA25#PPA18,M1 | page = 18 | title = On life and times of George Joseph, 1887\u20131938, a Syrian Christian nationalist from Kerala | author = Joseph, George Gheverghese | publisher = Orient Longman | year = 2003 | accessdate = 2007-12-09 | isbn=978-81-250-2495-8}}</ref> This tradition is still evident as Ezhavas show greater interest in the moral, non-ritualistic, and non-dogmatic aspects of the religion rather than the theological.<ref name=\"Smith1976pp26-30\"/>\n\n==Past occupations==\nThe social anthropologists Filippo and Caroline Osella say that the Ezhavas \"...&nbsp;consisted in the mid-nineteenth century of a small landowning and titled elite and a large mass of landless and small tenants who were largely illiterate, considered untouchable, and who eked out a living by manual labour and petty trade.\"<ref name=\"Osella8\">{{cite book |title=Social Mobility in Kerala: Modernity and Identity in Conflict |first1=Filippo |last1=Osella |first2=Caroline |last2=Osella |publisher=Pluto Press |year=2000 |isbn=978-0-7453-1693-2 |page=8 |url=https://books.google.com.au/books?id=rMRw0gTZSJwC&pg=PA8}}</ref>{{efn|Gough describes Thiyya subtenants in Central Travancore, who worked land held by the Nair caste.

This activity is sometimes erroneously referred to as ''toddy tapping'', toddy being a liquor manufactured from the sap. Arrack was another liquor produced from the palms, as was jaggery (an unrefined sugar). In reality, most Ezhavas were agricultural labourers and small-time cultivators, with a substantial number diverging into the production of [[coir]] products, such as coconut mats for flooring, from towards the end of the 19th century.<ref name=\"Nossiter1982p30\"/> The coastal town of [[Alleppey]] became the centre of such manufacture and was mostly controlled by Ezhavas, although the lucrative export markets were accessible only through European traders, who monopolised the required equipment. A boom in trade for these manufactured goods after [[World War I]] led to a unique situation in twentieth-century Kerala whereby there was a shortage of labour, which attracted still more Ezhavas to the industry from outlying rural areas. The [[Great Depression]] impacted in particular on the export trade, causing a reduction in price and in wages even though production increased, with the consequence that during the 1930s many Ezhava families found themselves to be in dire financial circumstances.<ref name=\"Osella50\" /><ref>{{cite book |title=Communal Road to a Secular Kerala |first=George |last=Mathew |publisher=Concept Publishing Company |year=1989 |isbn=978-81-7022-282-8 |pages=137\u2013138 |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=1TuPeXFP0WgC&pg=PA137}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |title='Destroy Capitalism!': Growing Solidarity of Alleppey's Coir Workers, 1930\u201340 |first=Robin |last=Jeffrey |authorlink=Robin Jeffrey |journal=Economic and Political Weekly |volume=19 |issue=29 |pages=1159\u20131165 |date=21 July 1984 |jstor=4373437}} {{subscription required}}</ref>\n\nSome Ezhavas were involved in weaving and ship making.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=bVgeAAAAMAAJ&dq=jaggery+izhava&q=jaggery|title= Religion and ideology in Kerala |page=246|first=Genevi\u00e8ve |last=Lemercinier|publisher=D.K.

This is also known as Pandavarkali, which means the play of the Pandavas, (the five heroes of the ''[[Mahabharatha]]''), and is performed by Asari, Moosari, Karuvan, Thattan and Kallasari communities. This ritualistic dance is performed beneath a decorated pandal with a [[nilavilakku]] at its centre.

Arjuna nritham is also called \"Mayilpeeli Thookkam\" as the costume includes a characteristic garment made of mayilppeeli ([[peacock]] feathers). This garment is worn around the waist in a similar fashion as the \"uduthukettu\" of [[Kathakali]]. The various dance movements are closely similar to [[Kalarippayattu]] techniques. The performers have their faces painted green and wear distinctive headgears.  The all night performance of the dance form is usually presented solo or in pairs.<ref name = \"ezh22\"/>\n\n===Makachuttu===\nMakachuttu art is popular among Ezhavas in [[Thiruvananthapuram]] and Chirayinkizhu taluks and in [[Kilimanoor]], Pazhayakunnummal and Thattathumala regions. In this, a group of eight performers, two each, twin around each other like serpents and rise up, battling with sticks. The techniques are repeated several times.

Those living in southern [[Travancore]] tended to meld the different practices that existed in the other parts of Kerala. The family arrangements of northern [[Malabar (Northern Kerala)|Malabar]] were matrilineal with patrilocal property arrangements, whereas in northern Travancore they were matrilineal but usually matrilocal in their arrangements for property. Southern Malabar saw a patrilineal system but partible property.<ref name=\"Nossiter1982p30\"/>\n\nThese arrangements were reformed by legislation, for Malabar in 1925 and for Travancore in 1933. The process of reform was more easily achieved for the Ezhavas than it was for the [[Nair]]s, another [[Caste system in India|Hindu caste]] in Kerala who adopted matrilineal arrangements; the situation for the Nairs was complicated by a traditional matrilocal form of living called ''[[tharavadu|taravadu]]'' and by their usually much higher degree of property ownership.<ref name=\"Nossiter1982p30\"/>\n\n===Thiyyar Marriage===\n\n[[Edgar Thurston]] has described Thiyyar wedding in his [[Castes and Tribes of Southern India]] as\n\n\"The South Malabar Tiyan bridegroom, dressed as if for a wrestling match, with his cloth tied tight about his loins, carries a sword and shield, and is escorted by two companions similarly equipped, dancing their way along. The Izhuvan does not carry a sword under any circumstances. The chief feature of his wedding ceremony is a singing match. This, called the vatil-tura-pattu, or open the door song, assumes the form of a contest between the parties of the bridegroom and bride. The story of Krishna and his wife Rukmini is supposed to be alluded to. We have seen it all under slightly different colour at Conjeeveram. Krishna asks Rukmini to open the door, and admit him. She refuses, thinking he has been gallivanting with some other lady. He beseeches ; she refuses. He explains, and at length she yields. The song is more or less extem- pore, and each \"side must be ready with an immediate answer. The side which is reduced to the extremity of having no answer is beaten and under ignominy. Marriage is strictly forbidden between two persons belonging to the same illam. The bride and bridegroom must belong to different illams. In fact, the illams are exogamous. The following formula is repeated by the headman of the bride's party. Translated as accurately as possible, it runs thus. \"The tara and changati of both sides having met and consulted ; the astrologer having fixed an auspicious day after examining the star and porutham ; permission having been obtained from the tara, the relations, the illam and kulam, the father, uncle, and the brothers, and from the eight and four (twelve illams) and the six and four (ten kiriyams) ; the conji and adayalam ceremonies and the four tazhus having been performed, let me perform the kanjikudi ceremony for the marriage of ....

This was named after [[Narayana Guru]], who had established an ''[[ashram]]'' from where he preached his message of \"one caste, one religion, one god\" and a Sanskritised version of the Victorian concept of self-help. His influence locally has been compared to that of [[Swami Vivekananda]].<ref name=\"Nossiter1982pp30-32\" /> One of the initial aims of the SNDP was to campaign for the removal of the restrictions on school entry but even after those legal barriers to education were removed, it was uncommon in practice for Ezhavas to be admitted to government schools. Thus, the campaign shifted to providing schools operated by the community itself.<ref name=\"Padmanabhan\" /> The organisation, attracted support in Travancore but similar bodies in Cochin were less successful. In Malabar, which unlike Cochin and Travancore was under direct British control,<ref name=\"SchneiderGoughp304\">{{cite book |title=Matrilineal Kinship |editor1-first=David Murray |editor1-last=Schneider |editor2-first=E.

The [[Vaikom Satyagraha]] of 1924\u20131925 was a failed attempt to use the issue of ''[[avarna]]'' access to roads around temples in order to revive the fortunes of [[Indian National Congress|Congress]], orchestrated by [[T. K. Madhavan]], a revolutionary and civil rights activist,<ref name=\"Smith1976p38\">[[#Smith1976|Pullapilly (1976)]] p. 38</ref> and with a famous temple at [[Vaikom]] as the focal point. Although it failed in its stated aim of achieving access, the [[satyagraha]] (movement) did succeed in voicing a \"radical rhetoric\", according to Nossiter.<ref name=\"Nossiter1982pp30-32\"/> During this movement, a few [[Khalsa|Akalis]]\u2014an order of armed [[Sikh]]s\u2014came to Vaikom in support of the demonstrators. After the eventual passing of the [[Temple Entry Proclamation]], some of the Akalis remained. They attracted some Ezhava youth to the concepts of the Sikhism, resulting in Ezhava conversions to Sikhism.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=C8EBAAAAMAAJ&q=sikhism+ezhava&dq=sikhism+ezhava|title= The abstention movement|page=19|first=K.K |last=Kusuman|publisher=Kerala Historical Society |year=1976|accessdate=2011-06-15}}</ref>\n\nThe success of the SNDP in improving the lot of Ezhavas has been questioned. Membership had reached 50,000 by 1928 and 60,000 by 1974, but Nossiter notes that, \"From the Vaikom ''satyagraha'' onwards the SNDP had stirred the ordinary Ezhava without materially improving his position.\" The division in the 1920s of 60,000 acres of properties previously held by substantial landowners saw the majority of Ezhava beneficiaries receive less than 1 acre each, although 2% of them took at least 40% of the available land. There was subsequently a radicalization and much political infighting within the leadership as a consequence of the effects of the [[Great Depression]] on the coir industry but the general notion of self-help was not easy to achieve in a primarily agricultural environment; the Victorian concept presumed an industrialised economy. The organisation lost members to various other groups, including the communist movement, and it was not until the 1950s that it reinvented itself as a pressure group and provider of educational opportunities along the lines of the [[Nair Service Society]] (NSS), Just as the NSS briefly formed the National Democratic Party in the 1970s in an attempt directly to enter the political arena, so too in 1972 the SNDP formed the Social Revolutionary Party.<ref name=\"Nossiter1982pp30-32\"/>\n\n==Position in society==\nThey were considered as ''avarna'' (outside brahmanical varna system) by the Nambudiri Brahmins who formed the Hindu clergy and ritual ruling elite in late medieval Kerala.<ref name=\"Nossiter1982p30\"/> [[Kathleen Gough]] says that the Thiyyas of Central Travancore were historically the highest-ranking of the \"higher polluting castes\", a group whose other constituents included [[Kanisan]]s and various artisanal castes, and who were all superior in status to the \"lower polluting castes\", such as the [[Pulayar]]s and [[Paraiyar]]s. The Nairs and, where applicable, the Mapillas ranked socially and ritually higher than the polluting castes.<ref name=\"Gough313\">{{cite book |title=Matrilineal Kinship |editor1-first=David Murray |editor1-last=Schneider |editor2-first=E.
