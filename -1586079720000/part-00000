Following the [[Cell migration|migration]] of lymphocytes into the glands in response to [[chemokines]] and specific [[adhesion molecule]]s, T cells interact with epithelial cells. Epithelial cells are further activated by [[proinflammatory cytokines]] (IL-1\u03b2, IFN-\u03b3, and TNF), which are produced by adjacent T cells. The early accumulation of [[plasma cell|plasmacytoid]] dendritic cells in the target tissues, which produce high levels of type 1 IFNs, seems important, as these cells can further dysregulate the immune response through abnormal retention of lymphocytes in the tissues and their subsequent activation. IFN-\u03b1 stimulates the production of [[B-cell activating factor]] (BAFF) by epithelial cells, DCs, and T cells. BAFF stimulates aberrant B-cell maturation, leading to the emergence of self-reactive B cells, which locally produce autoantibodies, in a [[germinal centre]]-like structure (GC-like), which is also the location of [[lymphomagenesis]] (origin of [[lymphoma]]).<ref name=Voulgarelis2010/>\n\n=== Programmed cell death ===\nDysregulation of [[apoptosis]] (programmed cell death) is believed to play a role in the pathogenesis of a variety of autoimmune diseases, though its role in SS is controversial.

Also, patients with SS symptoms approach different [[Specialty (medicine)|specialities]] for treatment, which can make diagnosis difficult. Since dry eyes and dry mouth are very common symptoms, and frequently occur in people over 40, people often think the symptoms are age-related and ignore them. However, some medications can cause symptoms similar to those of SS. The combination of several tests, which can be done in a series, can eventually diagnose SS.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\"/><ref name=\"Fox, R. I 2005\">{{cite journal | author = Fox R.

Primary Sj\u00f6gren syndrome occurs by itself and secondary Sj\u00f6gren syndrome occurs when another [[connective tissue]] disease is present.\n\nBlood tests can be done to determine if a patient has high levels of antibodies that are indicative of the condition, such as [[antinuclear antibody]] (ANA) and [[rheumatoid factor]] (because SS frequently occurs secondary to rheumatoid arthritis), which are associated with autoimmune diseases. Typical SS ANA patterns are [[Anti-SSA/Ro autoantibodies|SSA/Ro]] and [[Anti-nuclear antibody#Anti-Ro.2FSS-A and anti-La.2FSS-B|SSB/La]], of which Anti-SSB/La is far more specific; Anti-SSA/Ro is associated with numerous other autoimmune conditions, but are often present in SS. However, Anti-SSA and Anti-SSB tests are frequently not positive in SS.\n\nThe [[rose bengal]] test uses a stain that measures state and function of the [[lacrimal gland]]s. This test involves placing the [[non-toxic]] dye rose bengal on the eyes. The dye\u2019s distinctive colour helps in determining the state and functioning of tear film and the rate of tear evaporation.  Any distinctive colour change can indicate SS, but confirming the condition requires many related [[Medical test|diagnostic tools]].<ref name=\"Fox, R. I 2005\"/>\n\n[[Schirmer's test]] measures the production of tears: a strip of [[filter paper]] is held inside the lower eyelid for five minutes, and its wetness is then measured with a ruler. Producing less than {{Convert|5|mm|abbr=on}} of liquid is usually indicative of SS. This measurement analysis varies among people depending on other eye-related conditions and medications in use when the test is taken.<ref name=\"Fox, R. I 2005\"/> A [[slit-lamp examination]] can reveal dryness on the surface of the eye.\n\nSymptoms of dry mouth and dryness in the oral cavity are caused by the reduced production of saliva from the salivary glands ([[parotid gland]], [[submandibular gland]], and [[sublingual gland]]). To check the status of salivary glands and the production of saliva, a salivary flow-rate test is performed, in which the person is asked to spit as much as they can into a cup, and the resulting saliva sample is collected and weighed. This test's results can determine whether the salivary glands are functioning adequately. Not enough saliva produced could mean the person has SS.<ref name=\"Fox, R. I 2005\"/> An alternative test is non-stimulated whole saliva flow collection, in which the person spits into a [[test tube]] every minute for 15 minutes. A resultant collection of less than {{Convert|1.5|ml|abbr=on}} is considered a positive result.<ref name=\"Dr. J. Parks, Ancaster ON Canada\">Dr. J. Parks, Ancaster ON Canada</ref>\n\nA lip/salivary gland [[biopsy]] takes a tissue sample that can reveal [[lymphocyte]]s [[Gene cluster|clustered]] around salivary glands, and damage to these glands due to inflammation. This test involves removing a sample of tissue from a person\u2019s inner lip/salivary gland and examining it under a [[microscope]]. In addition, a [[sialogram]], a special [[X-ray]] test, is performed to see if any blockage is present in the salivary gland ducts (i.e. [[parotid duct]]) and the amount of saliva that flows into the mouth.<ref name=\"Fox, R. I 2005\"/>\n\nAlso, a radiological procedure is available as a reliable and accurate test for SS. A [[contrast agent]] is injected into the parotid duct, which opens from the cheek into the [[Human mouth|vestibule of the mouth]] opposite the neck of the upper second [[Molar (tooth)|molar tooth]]. [[Histopathology]] studies should show focal lymphocytic [[sialadenitis]]. Objective evidence of salivary gland involvement is tested through [[ultrasound]] examinations, the level of unstimulated whole salivary flow, a parotid [[sialography]] or salivary [[scintigraphy]], and autoantibodies against Ro (SSA) and/or La (SSB) antigens.\n\nSS can be excluded from people with past head and neck [[radiation therapy]], [[acquired immunodeficiency syndrome|acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS)]], pre-existing [[lymphoma]], [[sarcoidosis]], [[graft-versus-host disease]], and use of [[Anticholinergic#Medical uses|anticholinergic drugs]].\n\n== Prevention ==\nThere is no prevention mechanism for SS due to its complexity as an autoimmune disorder. However, [[Lifestyle (sociology)|lifestyle]] changes can reduce the [[risk factors]] of getting SS or reduce the severity of the condition with patients who have already been diagnosed. [[Diet (nutrition)|Diet]] is strongly associated with inflammation that is mostly seen in many autoimmune related diseases including SS. An [[Experiment|experimental study]] concludes that SS patients show high [[Non-celiac gluten sensitivity|sensitivity to gluten]] that directly relates to inflammation.<ref name=\"pmid17613926\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Lid\u00e9n M, Kristj\u00e1nsson G, Valt\u00fdsd\u00f3ttir S, H\u00e4llgren R | title = Gluten sensitivity in patients with primary Sj\u00f6gren's syndrome | journal = Scand.

Instead, treatment is generally symptomatic and supportive.\n\n=== Eye care ===\nMoisture replacement therapies such as [[artificial tears]] may ease the symptoms of dry eyes. Some patients with more severe problems use [[goggles]] to increase local [[humidity]] or have [[punctal plugs]] inserted to help retain tears on the [[ocular]] surface for a longer time.\n\nAdditionally, [[cyclosporine]] (Restasis) is available by prescription to help treat chronic dry eye by suppressing the inflammation that disrupts tear secretion. [[Prescription drug]]s are also available that help to stimulate salivary flow, such as [[cevimeline]] (Evoxac) and pilocarpine. [[Salagen]], a manufactured form of [[pilocarpine]], can be used to help produce tears, as well as saliva in the mouth and intestines. It is derived from the [[Pilocarpus|jaborandi]] plant.<!-- .[17] [18][19] -->\n\n=== Vaginal dryness ===\nIn women with SS, vaginal dryness, [[vulvodynia]] and [[dyspareunia]] (painful [[sexual intercourse]]) are often reported; [[personal lubricants]] are recommended to help lessen irritation or pain that may result from dryness in the vaginal and [[vulva]] areas.<ref name=\"Fox, R. I 2005\"/>\n\n=== Musculoskeletal ===\n[[Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs]] (NSAIDs) may be used to treat musculoskeletal symptoms. For individuals with severe [[Complication (medicine)|complications]], [[corticosteroids]] or [[immunosuppressive drugs]] may be prescribed, and sometimes [[IVIG]] (intravenous immunoglobulin). Also, [[disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs]] (DMARDs) such as [[methotrexate]] may be helpful. [[Hydroxychloroquine]] (Plaquenil) is another option and is generally considered safer than methotrexate. However, these prescribed drugs have a range of [[side effects]] such as [[nausea]], [[loss of appetite]], [[dizziness]], [[hair loss]], [[Abdominal pain|stomach aches/cramps]], [[headache]], [[liver toxicity]], and increased risk of [[infections]]. Also, people who take drugs to suppress the immune system are more likely to develop [[cancer]] later.<ref name=\"Fox, R.

Typical SS ANA patterns are [[Anti-SSA/Ro autoantibodies|SSA/Ro]] and [[Anti-nuclear antibody#Anti-Ro.2FSS-A and anti-La.2FSS-B|SSB/La]], of which Anti-SSB/La is far more specific; Anti-SSA/Ro is associated with numerous other autoimmune conditions, but are often present in SS.

Objective evidence of salivary gland involvement is tested through [[ultrasound]] examinations, the level of unstimulated whole salivary flow, a parotid [[sialography]] or salivary [[scintigraphy]], and autoantibodies against Ro (SSA) and/or La (SSB) antigens.\n\nSS can be excluded from people with past head and neck [[radiation therapy]], [[acquired immunodeficiency syndrome|acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS)]], pre-existing [[lymphoma]], [[sarcoidosis]], [[graft-versus-host disease]], and use of [[Anticholinergic#Medical uses|anticholinergic drugs]].\n\n== Prevention ==\nThere is no prevention mechanism for SS due to its complexity as an autoimmune disorder. However, [[Lifestyle (sociology)|lifestyle]] changes can reduce the [[risk factors]] of getting SS or reduce the severity of the condition with patients who have already been diagnosed. [[Diet (nutrition)|Diet]] is strongly associated with inflammation that is mostly seen in many autoimmune related diseases including SS.

Instead, treatment is generally symptomatic and supportive.\n\n=== Eye care ===\nMoisture replacement therapies such as [[artificial tears]] may ease the symptoms of dry eyes. Some patients with more severe problems use [[goggles]] to increase local [[humidity]] or have [[punctal plugs]] inserted to help retain tears on the [[ocular]] surface for a longer time.\n\nAdditionally, [[cyclosporine]] (Restasis) is available by prescription to help treat chronic dry eye by suppressing the inflammation that disrupts tear secretion. [[Prescription drug]]s are also available that help to stimulate salivary flow, such as [[cevimeline]] (Evoxac) and pilocarpine. [[Salagen]], a manufactured form of [[pilocarpine]], can be used to help produce tears, as well as saliva in the mouth and intestines.

For individuals with severe [[Complication (medicine)|complications]], [[corticosteroids]] or [[immunosuppressive drugs]] may be prescribed, and sometimes [[IVIG]] (intravenous immunoglobulin). Also, [[disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs]] (DMARDs) such as [[methotrexate]] may be helpful. [[Hydroxychloroquine]] (Plaquenil) is another option and is generally considered safer than methotrexate. However, these prescribed drugs have a range of [[side effects]] such as [[nausea]], [[loss of appetite]], [[dizziness]], [[hair loss]], [[Abdominal pain|stomach aches/cramps]], [[headache]], [[liver toxicity]], and increased risk of [[infections]]. Also, people who take drugs to suppress the immune system are more likely to develop [[cancer]] later.<ref name=\"Fox, R.

It contains a tower topped by a stepped pyramid, as well as a curved [[facade]] along Broadway.\n\nThe original structure was built in 1884\u20131885 for [[Standard Oil]] on the former site of U.S. treasury secretary [[Alexander Hamilton]]'s house. The Standard Oil Building was expanded in 1895 and again after [[World War I]], when [[Walter C. Teagle]] bought four neighboring buildings to create a continuous lot. The building was greatly expanded to its current size in a multi-phase construction project that took place between 1921 and 1928. 26 Broadway was sold to another owner in 1956 but remained a prominent structure on Bowling Green. In 1995, the [[New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission]] designated 26 Broadway as an official city landmark.\n\n== Description ==\n26 Broadway is bounded by [[Broadway (Manhattan)|Broadway]] to the northwest and west (along [[Bowling Green (New York City)|Bowling Green]]), [[Beaver Street (Manhattan)|Beaver Street]] to the south, and New Street to the east/southeast.

The 31-story, {{convert|520|ft|m|adj=mid|-tall}} structure was designed in the [[Renaissance Revival architecture|Renaissance Revival]] style by [[Thomas Hastings (architect)|Thomas Hastings]] of [[Carr\u00e8re and Hastings]], in conjunction with [[Shreve, Lamb & Blake]].\n\n26 Broadway is located on a pentagonal site bounded by [[Broadway (Manhattan)|Broadway]] to the northwest, Bowling Green to the west, [[Beaver Street (Manhattan)|Beaver Street]] to the south, New Street to the east/southeast, and the axis of Morris Street to the north. It contains a tower topped by a stepped pyramid, as well as a curved [[facade]] along Broadway.\n\nThe original structure was built in 1884\u20131885 for [[Standard Oil]] on the former site of U.S. treasury secretary [[Alexander Hamilton]]'s house. The Standard Oil Building was expanded in 1895 and again after [[World War I]], when [[Walter C. Teagle]] bought four neighboring buildings to create a continuous lot. The building was greatly expanded to its current size in a multi-phase construction project that took place between 1921 and 1928. 26 Broadway was sold to another owner in 1956 but remained a prominent structure on Bowling Green. In 1995, the [[New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission]] designated 26 Broadway as an official city landmark.\n\n== Description ==\n26 Broadway is bounded by [[Broadway (Manhattan)|Broadway]] to the northwest and west (along [[Bowling Green (New York City)|Bowling Green]]), [[Beaver Street (Manhattan)|Beaver Street]] to the south, and New Street to the east/southeast.

During each academic period of ten weeks, students visit classes the first six to seven weeks. The remaining weeks are used for other types of educational activities, including preparing for exams.\n\nCourse-structure: most modules require the attendance of classes. A module then consists of several hours of classroom teaching or work and a number of hours of self-study.

It is located in a mountain valley within the [[North Cascades]] that was formed by the [[Sauk River (Washington)|Sauk River]] and [[Stillaguamish River|North Fork Stillaguamish River]]. Darrington is connected to nearby areas by [[Washington State Route 530|State Route 530]], which runs along the two rivers towards the city of [[Arlington, Washington|Arlington]], located {{convert|30|mi|km}} to the west, and [[Rockport, Washington|Rockport]]. It had a population of 1,347 at the [[2010 United States Census|2010 census]].\n\nThe town was founded in 1891 on the site of a [[Skagit people|Skagit]] campsite between the two rivers, near the traditional home of the [[Sauk-Suiattle Indian Tribe of Washington|Sauk-Suiattle]] tribe. [[Prospectors]] had arrived in the area during the 1880s while looking for [[gold]] and other minerals, but were quickly displaced by the [[logging]] industry that would come to dominate Darrington for much of the 20th century. The [[Northern Pacific Railway]] built a [[branch line]] to the town in 1901 and ushered in several years of growth.\n\nDuring the [[Great Depression]], Darrington hosted a [[Civilian Conservation Corps]] camp that improved roads, trails, and firefighting infrastructure in the nearby [[Mount Baker National Forest]]. Several waves of [[Appalachian Americans|Appalachian]] emigrants arrived in the area from [[North Carolina]], forming a culture that is seen in the town's annual [[bluegrass festival]] and [[rodeo]].\n\nDarrington was [[municipal incorporation|incorporated]] as a town on October 15, 1945, and continues to operate under a [[mayor\u2013council government]]. It has transitioned away from logging and towards tourism due to its proximity to the [[Mount Baker-Snoqualmie National Forest]], which includes outdoor activities such as hiking, mountain climbing, and fishing. The Darrington area is {{convert|554|ft|m}} above [[mean sea level|sea level]] and receives significantly more precipitation and [[snowfall]] than the [[Puget Sound region|Puget Sound lowlands]].\n\n==History==\n\n===Prehistory and early exploration===\n\nThe upper Stillaguamish and Sauk valleys on the [[Sauk River (Washington)|Sauk]], [[Suiattle River|Suiattle]], and [[White Chuck River|White Chuck]] rivers were historically inhabited by various [[Coast Salish]] groups, including the [[Stillaguamish people|Stillaguamish]], the [[Sauk-Suiattle Indian Tribe of Washington|Sauk-Suiattle]], and the [[Upper Skagit Indian Tribe|Upper Skagit]].<ref name=\"HistoryLink\">{{cite web |last=Oakley |first=Janet |date=January 17, 2009 |title=Darrington \u2014 Thumbnail History |url=https://www.historylink.org/File/8798 |work=[[HistoryLink]] |accessdate=February 28, 2019}}</ref> The Sauk-Suiattle maintained a village site and burial ground near modern-day Darrington, while the Skagits used the plain between the Stillaguamish and Sauk rivers as a [[portage]] for overhead transport of canoes.

It is located in a mountain valley within the [[North Cascades]] that was formed by the [[Sauk River (Washington)|Sauk River]] and [[Stillaguamish River|North Fork Stillaguamish River]]. Darrington is connected to nearby areas by [[Washington State Route 530|State Route 530]], which runs along the two rivers towards the city of [[Arlington, Washington|Arlington]], located {{convert|30|mi|km}} to the west, and [[Rockport, Washington|Rockport]]. It had a population of 1,347 at the [[2010 United States Census|2010 census]].\n\nThe town was founded in 1891 on the site of a [[Skagit people|Skagit]] campsite between the two rivers, near the traditional home of the [[Sauk-Suiattle Indian Tribe of Washington|Sauk-Suiattle]] tribe. [[Prospectors]] had arrived in the area during the 1880s while looking for [[gold]] and other minerals, but were quickly displaced by the [[logging]] industry that would come to dominate Darrington for much of the 20th century. The [[Northern Pacific Railway]] built a [[branch line]] to the town in 1901 and ushered in several years of growth.\n\nDuring the [[Great Depression]], Darrington hosted a [[Civilian Conservation Corps]] camp that improved roads, trails, and firefighting infrastructure in the nearby [[Mount Baker National Forest]]. Several waves of [[Appalachian Americans|Appalachian]] emigrants arrived in the area from [[North Carolina]], forming a culture that is seen in the town's annual [[bluegrass festival]] and [[rodeo]].\n\nDarrington was [[municipal incorporation|incorporated]] as a town on October 15, 1945, and continues to operate under a [[mayor\u2013council government]]. It has transitioned away from logging and towards tourism due to its proximity to the [[Mount Baker-Snoqualmie National Forest]], which includes outdoor activities such as hiking, mountain climbing, and fishing. The Darrington area is {{convert|554|ft|m}} above [[mean sea level|sea level]] and receives significantly more precipitation and [[snowfall]] than the [[Puget Sound region|Puget Sound lowlands]].\n\n==History==\n\n===Prehistory and early exploration===\n\nThe upper Stillaguamish and Sauk valleys on the [[Sauk River (Washington)|Sauk]], [[Suiattle River|Suiattle]], and [[White Chuck River|White Chuck]] rivers were historically inhabited by various [[Coast Salish]] groups, including the [[Stillaguamish people|Stillaguamish]], the [[Sauk-Suiattle Indian Tribe of Washington|Sauk-Suiattle]], and the [[Upper Skagit Indian Tribe|Upper Skagit]].<ref name=\"HistoryLink\">{{cite web |last=Oakley |first=Janet |date=January 17, 2009 |title=Darrington \u2014 Thumbnail History |url=https://www.historylink.org/File/8798 |work=[[HistoryLink]] |accessdate=February 28, 2019}}</ref> The Sauk-Suiattle maintained a village site and burial ground near modern-day Darrington, while the Skagits used the plain between the Stillaguamish and Sauk rivers as a [[portage]] for overhead transport of canoes.

Thus they are often referred to in English-language research as \"[[Viking]] Rus'\". The scholarly consensus <ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.historyextra.com/period/viking/the-vikings-at-home/|title=The Vikings at home|website=History Extra}}</ref> is that the Rus' people originated in what is currently coastal [[East Middle Sweden|eastern Sweden]] around the eighth century and that their name has the same origin as [[Roslagen]] in [[Sweden]] (with the older name being ''[[Roden, Sweden|Roden]]'').\n\nBasing themselves among [[Slavs]] and [[Volga Finns]] in the upper [[Volga region]], they formed a diaspora of traders and raiders exchanging furs and slaves for silk, silver and other commodities available to the east and south. Around the ninth century, on the river routes to the [[Black Sea]], they had an unclear but significant role in forming the principality of [[Kievan Rus]], gradually assimilating with local [[Slavic peoples|Slavic populations]]. They also extended their operations much further east and south, among the [[Bulgars]] and [[Khazars]], on the routes to the [[Caspian Sea]]. By around the eleventh century, the word ''Rus{{'}}'' was increasingly associated with the principality of Kiev, and the term ''[[Varangian]]'' was becoming more common as a term for Scandinavians traveling the river-routes.\n\nLittle, however, is certain about the Rus{{'}}. This is to a significant extent because, although Rus{{'}} people were active over a long period and vast distances, textual evidence for their activities is very sparse and almost never produced by contemporary Rus' people themselves. It is believed that writing was brought to the Rus by the Slavs for religious reasons, but this happened long after their early history. The word ''Rus{{'}}'' in the primary sources does not always mean the same thing as it does when used by today's scholars. Meanwhile, archaeological evidence and researchers' understanding of it is accumulating only gradually. As a trading diaspora, Rus' people intermingled extensively with Finnic, Slavic, and Turkic peoples and their customs and identity seem correspondingly to have varied considerably over time and space.\n\nThe other key reason for dispute about the origins of Rus' people is the likelihood that they had a role in ninth- to tenth-century state formation in eastern Europe (ultimately giving their name to [[Russia]] and [[Belarus]]), making them relevant to what are today seen as the national histories of [[Russia]], [[Ukraine]], [[Sweden]], [[Poland]], [[Belarus]], [[Finland]] and [[Baltic states]]. \n\n== Key sources ==\n=== Etymology ===\n{{Main|Rus' (name)}}\n[[File:Europe 814.png|right|thumb|300px|[[Europe]] in the 9th century. [[Roslagen]] is located along the coast of the northern tip of the pink area marked ''\"Swedes and Goths\"''.]]\n\nThe etymology and semantic history of the word ''Rus{{'}}'' has been a highly contentious topic, on which debate is ongoing. This is partly because of a widespread assumption that by identifying the linguistic origin of the name ''Rus{{'}}'', scholars can identify the origins of the people whom it described. This assumption has, however, been criticized in twenty-first-century scholarship.<ref>James E.

There was no law among them, but tribe rose against tribe. Discord thus ensued among them, and they began to war one against the other. They said to themselves, \"Let us seek a prince who may rule over us, and judge us according to the Law\". They accordingly went overseas to the Varangian Russes: these particular Varangians were known as Russes, just as some are called [[Swedes (Germanic tribe)|Swedes]], and others [[Normans]], [[Angles|English]], and [[Gutes|Gotlanders]], for they were thus named. The Chuds, the Slavs, the Krivichians and the Ves' then said to the people of Rus', \"Our land is great and rich, but there is no order in it. Come to rule and reign over us\". Thus they selected three brothers, with their kinsfolk, who took with them all the Russes and migrated. The oldest, Rurik, located himself in Novgorod; the second, [[Sineus and Truvor|Sineus]], at [[Beloozero]]; and the third, [[Sineus and Truvor|Truvor]], in [[Izborsk]].

The Varangians (''Varyags'', in [[Old East Slavic language|Old East Slavic]]) are first mentioned by the ''[[Primary Chronicle]]'' as having exacted tribute from the Slavic and Finnic tribes in 859. It was the time of rapid expansion of the Vikings in Northern Europe; England began to pay [[Danegeld]] in 859, and the [[Curonians]] of [[Grobin]] faced an invasion by the Swedes at about the same date.\n\nIt has been argued that the word ''Varangian'', in its many forms, does not appear in primary sources until the eleventh century (though it does appear frequently in later sources describing earlier periods). This suggests that the term ''Rus{{'}}'' was used broadly to denote Scandinavians until it became too firmly associated with the now extensively Slavicised elite of Kievan Rus. At that point, the new term ''Varangian'' was increasingly preferred to name Scandinavians, probably mostly from what is currently Sweden,<ref>{{cite book|last1=Forte|first1=Angelo|first2=Richard|last2=Oram|first3=Frederik|last3=Pedersen|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_vEd859jvk0C&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_navlinks_s#v=onepage&q=&f=false |title=Viking Empires|publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]]|year= 2005|ISBN= 0-521-82992-5|pages=13\u201314}}</ref> plying the river-routes between the Baltic and the Black/Caspian Seas.<ref>Marika M\u00e4gi, ''In <i>Austrvegr</i>: The Role of the Eastern Baltic in Viking Age Communication Across the Baltic Sea'', The Northern World, 84 (Leiden: Brill, 2018), p. 195, citing Alf Thulin, 'The Rus' of Nestor's Chronicle', ''Mediaeval Scandinavia'', 13 (2000), 70-96.</ref>\n\nDue largely to geographic considerations, it is often argued that most of the Varangians who traveled and settled in the lands of eastern Baltic, modern Russian Federation and lands to the south came from the area of modern [[Sweden]].\n\nThe Varangians left a number of [[varangian runestones|rune stones]] in their native [[Sweden]] that tell of their journeys to what is today Russia, Ukraine, Greece, and Belarus. Most of these rune stones can be seen today, and are a telling piece of historical evidence. The [[Varangian runestones]] tell of many notable Varangian expeditions, and even account for the fates of individual warriors and travelers.\n\nIn Russian history, two cities are used to describe the beginnings of the country: Kiev and Novgorod.<ref name=\"auto9\">Duczko, Wladyslaw. Viking Rus\u202f: Studies on the Presence of Scandinavians in Eastern Europe. The Northern World. Leiden: Brill, 2004.</ref> In the first part of the eleventh century the former was already a Slav metropolis, rich and powerful, a fast growing center of civilization adopted from Byzantium. The latter town, Novgorod, was another center of the same culture but founded in different surroundings, where some old local traditions molded this commercial city into a mighty oligarchic republic of a kind otherwise unknown in this part of Europe. These towns have tended to overshadow other places of a significance that they had acquired long before Kiev and Novgorod. The two original centers of Rus were Staraja Ladoga and Rurikovo Gorodishche, two points on the ends the Volkhov, a river running for 200 km between [[Lake Ilmen]] in the south to [[Lake Ladoga]] in the north<ref name=\"auto9\"/>. This was the territory that most probably was originally called by the Norsemen Gardar, a name that long after Viking Age was given much wider content and become Gardariki, denomination for whole Old Russian State. The area between the lakes was the original Rus, and it was from here its name was transferred to the Slav territories on the middle Dnieper, which eventually became \u201cRuskaja zemlja\u201d.<ref name=\"auto9\"/> The pre-history of the first territory of Rus has been sought in the developments around the mid eighth century, when Staraja Ladoga was founded as a trading place, serving the operations of Scandinavian hunters and dealers in furs obtained in the north-eastern forest zone of Eastern Europe. In the early period (the second part of the eighth and first part of the ninth century) Norse presence is only visible at Staraja Ladoga, and to a much lesser degree at a few other sites in the northern parts of Eastern Europe. The objects that represent Norse material culture of this period are rare outside Ladoga and mostly known as single finds. This rarity continues through the ninth century until the whole situation changes radically during the next century, when historians meet, at many places and in relatively large quantities, the material remains of a thriving Scandinavian culture.<ref name=\"auto9\"/> For a short period of time, some areas of Eastern Europe became as much part of the Norse world as were Danish and Norwegian territories in the West. The culture of the Rus contained Norse elements used as a manifestation of their Scandinavian background. These elements, which were current in tenth century Scandinavia, appear at various places in form of collections of many types of metal ornaments, mainly female but even male, such as weapons, decorated parts of horse bridle, and diverse objects embellished in current Norse art styles.<ref name=\"auto9\"/>\n\n== Debate on the origins of the Rus' ==\nThe historiography of the origins of the Rus' is infamously contentious, due to its perceived importance for the legitimation of nation-building, imperialism, and independence movements within the Slavonic-speaking world, and for legitimating different political relationships between eastern and western European countries.

Thus they are often referred to in English-language research as \"[[Viking]] Rus'\". The scholarly consensus <ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.historyextra.com/period/viking/the-vikings-at-home/|title=The Vikings at home|website=History Extra}}</ref> is that the Rus' people originated in what is currently coastal [[East Middle Sweden|eastern Sweden]] around the eighth century and that their name has the same origin as [[Roslagen]] in [[Sweden]] (with the older name being ''[[Roden, Sweden|Roden]]'').\n\nBasing themselves among [[Slavs]] and [[Volga Finns]] in the upper [[Volga region]], they formed a diaspora of traders and raiders exchanging furs and slaves for silk, silver and other commodities available to the east and south. Around the ninth century, on the river routes to the [[Black Sea]], they had an unclear but significant role in forming the principality of [[Kievan Rus]], gradually assimilating with local [[Slavic peoples|Slavic populations]]. They also extended their operations much further east and south, among the [[Bulgars]] and [[Khazars]], on the routes to the [[Caspian Sea]]. By around the eleventh century, the word ''Rus{{'}}'' was increasingly associated with the principality of Kiev, and the term ''[[Varangian]]'' was becoming more common as a term for Scandinavians traveling the river-routes.\n\nLittle, however, is certain about the Rus{{'}}. This is to a significant extent because, although Rus{{'}} people were active over a long period and vast distances, textual evidence for their activities is very sparse and almost never produced by contemporary Rus' people themselves. It is believed that writing was brought to the Rus by the Slavs for religious reasons, but this happened long after their early history. The word ''Rus{{'}}'' in the primary sources does not always mean the same thing as it does when used by today's scholars. Meanwhile, archaeological evidence and researchers' understanding of it is accumulating only gradually. As a trading diaspora, Rus' people intermingled extensively with Finnic, Slavic, and Turkic peoples and their customs and identity seem correspondingly to have varied considerably over time and space.\n\nThe other key reason for dispute about the origins of Rus' people is the likelihood that they had a role in ninth- to tenth-century state formation in eastern Europe (ultimately giving their name to [[Russia]] and [[Belarus]]), making them relevant to what are today seen as the national histories of [[Russia]], [[Ukraine]], [[Sweden]], [[Poland]], [[Belarus]], [[Finland]] and [[Baltic states]]. \n\n== Key sources ==\n=== Etymology ===\n{{Main|Rus' (name)}}\n[[File:Europe 814.png|right|thumb|300px|[[Europe]] in the 9th century.

This is partly because of a widespread assumption that by identifying the linguistic origin of the name ''Rus{{'}}'', scholars can identify the origins of the people whom it described. This assumption has, however, been criticized in twenty-first-century scholarship.<ref>James E.

There was no law among them, but tribe rose against tribe. Discord thus ensued among them, and they began to war one against the other. They said to themselves, \"Let us seek a prince who may rule over us, and judge us according to the Law\". They accordingly went overseas to the Varangian Russes: these particular Varangians were known as Russes, just as some are called [[Swedes (Germanic tribe)|Swedes]], and others [[Normans]], [[Angles|English]], and [[Gutes|Gotlanders]], for they were thus named. The Chuds, the Slavs, the Krivichians and the Ves' then said to the people of Rus', \"Our land is great and rich, but there is no order in it. Come to rule and reign over us\". Thus they selected three brothers, with their kinsfolk, who took with them all the Russes and migrated. The oldest, Rurik, located himself in Novgorod; the second, [[Sineus and Truvor|Sineus]], at [[Beloozero]]; and the third, [[Sineus and Truvor|Truvor]], in [[Izborsk]]. On account of these Varangians, the district of Novgorod became known as the land of Rus'.<ref name=\"RPC\">''[https://archive.org/details/TheRussianPrimaryChronicle The Russian Primary Chronicle: Laurentian Text'', ed. and trans. by Samuel Hazzard Cross and Olgerd P.

The Varangians (''Varyags'', in [[Old East Slavic language|Old East Slavic]]) are first mentioned by the ''[[Primary Chronicle]]'' as having exacted tribute from the Slavic and Finnic tribes in 859. It was the time of rapid expansion of the Vikings in Northern Europe; England began to pay [[Danegeld]] in 859, and the [[Curonians]] of [[Grobin]] faced an invasion by the Swedes at about the same date.\n\nIt has been argued that the word ''Varangian'', in its many forms, does not appear in primary sources until the eleventh century (though it does appear frequently in later sources describing earlier periods). This suggests that the term ''Rus{{'}}'' was used broadly to denote Scandinavians until it became too firmly associated with the now extensively Slavicised elite of Kievan Rus. At that point, the new term ''Varangian'' was increasingly preferred to name Scandinavians, probably mostly from what is currently Sweden,<ref>{{cite book|last1=Forte|first1=Angelo|first2=Richard|last2=Oram|first3=Frederik|last3=Pedersen|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_vEd859jvk0C&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_navlinks_s#v=onepage&q=&f=false |title=Viking Empires|publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]]|year= 2005|ISBN= 0-521-82992-5|pages=13\u201314}}</ref> plying the river-routes between the Baltic and the Black/Caspian Seas.<ref>Marika M\u00e4gi, ''In <i>Austrvegr</i>: The Role of the Eastern Baltic in Viking Age Communication Across the Baltic Sea'', The Northern World, 84 (Leiden: Brill, 2018), p. 195, citing Alf Thulin, 'The Rus' of Nestor's Chronicle', ''Mediaeval Scandinavia'', 13 (2000), 70-96.</ref>\n\nDue largely to geographic considerations, it is often argued that most of the Varangians who traveled and settled in the lands of eastern Baltic, modern Russian Federation and lands to the south came from the area of modern [[Sweden]].\n\nThe Varangians left a number of [[varangian runestones|rune stones]] in their native [[Sweden]] that tell of their journeys to what is today Russia, Ukraine, Greece, and Belarus. Most of these rune stones can be seen today, and are a telling piece of historical evidence. The [[Varangian runestones]] tell of many notable Varangian expeditions, and even account for the fates of individual warriors and travelers.\n\nIn Russian history, two cities are used to describe the beginnings of the country: Kiev and Novgorod.<ref name=\"auto9\">Duczko, Wladyslaw. Viking Rus\u202f: Studies on the Presence of Scandinavians in Eastern Europe. The Northern World. Leiden: Brill, 2004.</ref> In the first part of the eleventh century the former was already a Slav metropolis, rich and powerful, a fast growing center of civilization adopted from Byzantium. The latter town, Novgorod, was another center of the same culture but founded in different surroundings, where some old local traditions molded this commercial city into a mighty oligarchic republic of a kind otherwise unknown in this part of Europe. These towns have tended to overshadow other places of a significance that they had acquired long before Kiev and Novgorod. The two original centers of Rus were Staraja Ladoga and Rurikovo Gorodishche, two points on the ends the Volkhov, a river running for 200 km between [[Lake Ilmen]] in the south to [[Lake Ladoga]] in the north<ref name=\"auto9\"/>. This was the territory that most probably was originally called by the Norsemen Gardar, a name that long after Viking Age was given much wider content and become Gardariki, denomination for whole Old Russian State. The area between the lakes was the original Rus, and it was from here its name was transferred to the Slav territories on the middle Dnieper, which eventually became \u201cRuskaja zemlja\u201d.<ref name=\"auto9\"/> The pre-history of the first territory of Rus has been sought in the developments around the mid eighth century, when Staraja Ladoga was founded as a trading place, serving the operations of Scandinavian hunters and dealers in furs obtained in the north-eastern forest zone of Eastern Europe. In the early period (the second part of the eighth and first part of the ninth century) Norse presence is only visible at Staraja Ladoga, and to a much lesser degree at a few other sites in the northern parts of Eastern Europe. The objects that represent Norse material culture of this period are rare outside Ladoga and mostly known as single finds. This rarity continues through the ninth century until the whole situation changes radically during the next century, when historians meet, at many places and in relatively large quantities, the material remains of a thriving Scandinavian culture.<ref name=\"auto9\"/> For a short period of time, some areas of Eastern Europe became as much part of the Norse world as were Danish and Norwegian territories in the West. The culture of the Rus contained Norse elements used as a manifestation of their Scandinavian background. These elements, which were current in tenth century Scandinavia, appear at various places in form of collections of many types of metal ornaments, mainly female but even male, such as weapons, decorated parts of horse bridle, and diverse objects embellished in current Norse art styles.<ref name=\"auto9\"/>\n\n== Debate on the origins of the Rus' ==\nThe historiography of the origins of the Rus' is infamously contentious, due to its perceived importance for the legitimation of nation-building, imperialism, and independence movements within the Slavonic-speaking world, and for legitimating different political relationships between eastern and western European countries.

At the beginning of an important speech in 1749, later published as ''Origines gentis et nominis Russorum'' ('The Origins of the People and the Name of the Russians'), M\u00fcller argued that Russia owed its name and early ruling dynasty to ethnically Scandinavian Varangians.<ref name=\"auto11\">Serhii Plokhy, ''Ukraine and Russia: Representations of the Past'' (Toronto: University of Toronto Press, 2008), chapter 1.</ref><ref>Elena Melnikova, 'The \"Varangian Problem\": Science in the Grip of Ideology and Politics', in ''Russia's Identity in International Relations: Images, Perceptions, Misperceptions'', ed. by Ray Taras (Abingdon: Routledge, 2013), pp. 42-52 (p. 43).</ref> This statement caused anger in his Russian audience, and earned him much animosity during his professional career in Russia.<ref name=\"auto11\"/><ref name=\"auto10\"/> Scathing criticism from [[Mikhail Lomonosov|Lomonosov]], [[Stepan Krasheninnikov|Krasheninnikov]], and other Russian historians led to M\u00fcller being forced to suspend his work on the issue until Lomonosov's death.

They view the Rus' as disparate, and often mutually antagonistic, clans of charismatic warriors and traders who formed wide-ranging networks across the North and Baltic Seas.<ref name=\"Pritsak 1981 14\">{{harvtxt|Pritsak|1981|p=14}}</ref><ref>{{harvtxt|Lunt|1975|p=271}}</ref> They were a \"multi-ethnic, multilingual and non-territorial community of sea nomads and trading settlements\" that contained numerous Norsemen\u2014but equally Slavs, Balts, and Finns.<ref name=\"Pritsak 1981 14\"/>\n\nEvidence provided by the ''Primary Chronicle'', written some three centuries later, cannot be taken as an accurate ethnographic account; as tales of 'migration' from distant lands were common literary ''topoi'' used by rulers to legitimise their contemporary rule whilst at the same time differentiating themselves from their \"Baltic\" and \"Slavic\" subject tribes.

The Rus' appeared to emulate aspects of [[Khazar]] political organization\u2014hence the mention of a Rus' ''[[Khagan|chaganus]]'' in the [[Carolingian Empire|Carolingian]] court in 839 (''[[Royal Frankish Annals]]'').

Devoid of any silver dirham finds in the 8th century AD, it was situated west of the profitable fur and silver trade networks that spanned from the Baltic to the Muslim lands, via the [[Volga region|Volga]]-[[Kama River|Kama]] basins. At the prime hill in Kiev, fortifications and other symbols of consolidation and power appear from the 9th century, thus preceding the literary appearance of 'Rus' in the middle Dnieper region. By the 10th century, the lowlands around Kiev had extensive 'Slavic' styled settlements, and there is evidence of growing trade with the Byzantine lands. This might have attracted Rus' movements, and a shift in power, from the north to Kiev.<ref>{{harvtxt|Franklin|1996|pp=90\u2013122}}</ref> Thus, Kiev does not appear to have evolved from the infrastructure of the Scandinavian trade networks, but rather it forcibly took them over, as evidenced by the destruction of numerous earlier trade settlements in the north, including the famous [[Staraya Ladoga|Staraja Ladoga]].<ref>Tolochko p. 186</ref>\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist|colwidth=30em}}\n\n== Bibliography ==\n* ''The Annals of Saint-Bertin'', transl.

It offered bachelor programmes in tourism and leisure and in this field, it was and still is the largest and leading education institution in the world. In 1987 NWIT merged with the in 1972 founded Verkeersakademie Tilburg (VAT), to form Nationale hogeschool voor toerisme en verkeer (NHTV).

She has also produced three public sculptures for the City of Hue, [[Vietnam]] (1998, 2002, 2006).<ref name=\"Bonita Ely\">{{cite web|title=Bonita Ely|url=http://www.scanlines.net/person/bonita-ely|website=Scanlines|accessdate=8 March 2015}}</ref>\n\n==Art career==\nEly's first exhibition was in London in 1972, but recognition of her artwork in Australia effectively started at the Mildura Sculpture Triennial of 1975.<ref name=\"Bonita Ely\"/> Her interdisciplinary installation, ''C20th Mythological Beasts: at Home with the Locust People'' (1975) had its beginnings in New York where Bonita Ely lived from 1973 to 1975.<ref>{{cite web|title=Bonita Ely|url=http://www.videoartchive.org.au/bely/|website=Australian Video Art Online|accessdate=8 March 2015}}</ref>\n\nHer performances of the 1970s and 1980s were concerned primarily with environmental and political issues. For instance in her performance, Jabiluka UO2, [1979] she explored issues surrounding Aboriginal Land Rights and uranium mining in the Northern Territory.<ref name=\"Body and Self\">{{cite book|last1=Marsh|first1=Anne|title=Body and Self: Performance Art in Australia 1969-92|date=1993|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Melbourne, Australia|page=143}}</ref>\n\nIn her work  ''Breadline'' (1980) themes of womanhood and pregnancy were examined. Ely cast and moulded shapes of her body in bread dough which she washed off in a bath of milk. During this action bread was baked then served to viewers after the performance. As a complex exploration of women's traditional roles, the performance is both a celebration of motherhood and nurture, and  a critique of woman as a consumable product of culture.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Engberg|first1=Juliana|title=Breadline: Women and Food|journal=Artlink|date=1999|volume=19|issue=4}}</ref> ''Murray River Punch'' (1980) is one of Ely's most well known and significant performances.<ref>{{cite web|title=Murry River Punch|url=http://www.ngv.vic.gov.au/col/work/91051|website=National Gallery of Victoria|accessdate=8 March 2015}}</ref> The work was first performed at Melbourne University's George Paton Gallery in June 1980 as part of a week of performance titled ''Women at Work''.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Burke|first1=Janine|title=Field of vision: a decade of change : women's art in the seventies|date=1990|publisher=Viking|location=Ringwood, Vic., Australia|isbn=0 670 835862|page=94}}</ref> In this work the artist set up a cooking demonstration in the university's Student Union foyer at lunchtime and assumed the role of a cooking demonstrator who narrates the recipe for a \u2018punch\u2019 drink, the ingredients coming from pollutants in the Murray River.\n\nThe Murray River, one of the world's longest rivers (2,700&nbsp;km) has been an enduring focus of her practice, most recently  addressing its declining health during the Millennium Drought when environmentally unsustainable agricultural practices exacerbated acid sulphate contamination and outbreaks of blue green algae. Bonita Ely's forensic research along the length of the river resulted in a photographic series titled 'The Murray's Edge'. A reprise of 'Murray River Punch'  with the subtitle, 'the C21st', produced a tasty (not) dip due to a scarcity of water, the ingredients all the pollutants in the river.\n\nIn ''Dogwoman Communicates with the Younger Generation'' (1981), and ''Dogwoman Makes History'' (1983), the anthropomorphised fascination with another species was documented, alongside the gendered construction of history, using images of dogs in the art of Berlin museums, documented whilst artist in residence at Kunstlerhaus Bethanien, Berlin.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Marsh|first1=Anne|title=Body and Self: Performance Art in Australia 1969\u201392|date=1993|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Melbourne, Australia|isbn=9780195535068|page=146}}</ref>\n\nIn 1998 Bonita Ely was invited to create a public sculpture for the Children's Cultural Centre in Hue, Vietnam, participating in the 2nd Sculpture Symposium. Her interactive work takes the form of a hollow haystack, referencing the conical stacks made of rice 'hay' in the fields around Hue that were used for cooking fires, not animal feed. The sculpture's three arch shaped entrances are approximately one metre high, children's height, and its barrel shaped base acts like an acoustic chamber, collecting the sounds in the environment surrounding it. Small holes in the conical space above illumine the interior with soft bands of light. The sculpture is made from the small, traditional bricks from the Citadel's brickworks. As such it is a record of bygone cultural materials & practices.\n\nResearch of Hue's longevity characters informed another public sculpture in Hue titled \"Longevity: Scissors and Sickles\" (2002). Scissors and sickles made by local blacksmiths were caste and braised together in a lattice pattern to form a three dimensional interpretation of a longevity symbol. Shaped like a gourd, the scrap metal used included shrapnel from the American War, as the Vietnamese call it.\n\nIn 2006 Bonita was invited back for Hue's 4th International Sculpture Symposium, where her sculpture glows in the dark using solar paint \u2013 a sceptre of the Earth's energies at night. The title, \"Lake Thunder\" brings the sculpture's site, Thuy Tien Lake, into focus as an essential aspect of the work. The conjunction of lake and thunder also refers to traditional Taoist philosophical principals:\n\"THUNDER stands for our true essence, LAKE stands for our true sense, WATER stands for our real knowledge, and FIRE stands for our conscious knowledge. These four are the true 'four forms' inherent in us.\" \n[from the Inner Teachings of Taoism, Chang Po-Tuan, Shambala Books, 1986]\n\nThis zig zag symbol, warning of the danger of electricity, began its permutations in a three part installation, \"We Live to be Surprised\" in Performance Space, Sydney in 1991. Nine red thunderbolts shoot out of the floor. In the space opposite, 'snabbits' - genetically engineered creatures combining the snail's legless body and rabbit's head - hide in ruins. They are the only living creatures left on Earth. A short story tells us they are an excellent source of food in the future's dystopian environments as they cannot escape and are delicious. Between the thunderbolts and the snabbits' habitat,  viewers pass through a corridor of golden light, a liminal space  between energy and entropy.\n\nIn 2010 Bonita Ely was selected to create a public artwork to celebrate the 10th Anniversary of Sydney's Green Olympics. Made from a recycled windmill, the 'Thunderbolt' is powered by solar energy, the sculpture's lighting signals to the community their level of energy consumption  in the neighborhood at night, changing colour from green to yellow to red.\n\nThese environmental works are informed by Ely's cross cultural research of our relationship to land, first tracing the narratives inscribed upon natural landscapes in Australia's Aboriginal mythologies, or song lines, that weave across tribal nations' countries, functioning as ethical, spiritual, and practical narratives used to navigate across complex terrain, embedding environmental knowledges essential for food gathering, hunting, reading the seasons, the winds, etc. Similarly in India's Hindu mythologies, Chinese and Japanese gardens, Europe's pre-Christian animistic belief systems, the landscape was/is inscribed with meaning. The installation, \"Juggernaut\" , shown in Sydney, Melbourne, Brisbane and the Asian Biennale of Contemporary Art, Dhaka, Bangladesh (1999),  evoked this inscription of terrain. Each giant, spiralling turn transforms its internal spatial form, its peripatetic force simultaneous to a sense of fragility - the giant spirals are kept in place with wedges at floor level and spacers held in tension between each turn of the spiral, so the sculpture's structural integrity is in 'suspended animation'.\n\nBonita Ely's recent installations exhibited in Documenta14, 2017, are 'Interior Decoration' in the Palais Bellevue in Kassel, Germany, and in Athens, 'Plastikus Progressus'.\n\n'Interior Decoration' investigates the inter-generational effects of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD).\n\n\u201cPTSD typically leads to emotional numbing, \u2026 recurrent nightmares, substance abuse (traditionally, alcoholism), \u2026 delusional outbursts of violence.\u201d (Goldstein, 2001).\n \nThe installation, 'Interior Decoration' is embedded into the domestic environment of the Palais Bellevue. It explores the inter generational effects of untreated post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) suffered, for example, by war veterans, refugees, Indigenous people, displaced people, victims of genocide. Constructed from domestic objects, the military is domesticated, the domestic militarised. For example, 'Sewing Machine Gun' is made from the conjunction of a Singer sewing machine, a woman's industry, bobbypins, her intimate femininity, to create a Vickers machine gun, problematising the encodings of these objects to present the viewer with emotionally charged conundrums reflective of complexities rather than a didactic illustration of gendered conflict. Similarly the bedroom furniture turned inside-out forms polished wooden tunnel-like trenches, hiding places, all surveyed by the ladder-less 'Watchtower', made from a marriage bed, its floor the wire springs of a child's cot mattress. The installation embeds the viewer in the uncanny feelings of an adult transported back to childhood, inviting exploration to uncover its multiplicities.\n\nThe sculptural components are contextualised by a dado around the room composed of a visual narrative addressing trauma, and the names of Kassel's Jewish people deported and killed during WW2.  Their names are inscribed on a section of railway tracks at the KulturBahnhof (Kassel Central Station), an installation by Dr. Horst Hoheisel, 'Das Ged\u00e4chtnis der Gleise' (2015) - 'The Memory of the Tracks'.   'Interior Decoration' is a reminder of PTSD as a ubiquitous yet under acknowledged cause of conflict and suffering  in social and personal relations.\n\nThe installation, 'Plastikus Progressus' in the Athens iteration of Documenta14 is exhibited in the Athens School of Fine Arts Gallery. It addresses the contribution of casual littering to the plastics pollution of the trans-ecology of water.  Set in the year 2054, it takes the form of a natural history display. A diorama features plastic eating creatures, their physiologies built on vacuum cleaners & the parts thereof the artist found discarded on Sydney's streets. The creatures have been genetically  engineered using the CRISPR method to clean up the plastics polluting oceans  and rivers. The diorama is contextualised by photographs of pristine nature as it would have been in 1905, the year bakelite was invented, plus case studies of rivers in Athens, Kassel and Sydney, 2017, showing plastic pollution off city streets floating towards the ocean, contextualised by a world history from 2000BC to 2054AD showing the emergence, dominance then decline of nations, ending in 2054 with plastic filled, swirling gyres.\n\nEach genetically modified creature is described in a taxonomy presented on a touch screen. For example, the taxonomy of the creature called Hells Angel - Classification: Inferna angelus  : Common name, Hells Angel; \u03ac\u03b3\u03b3\u03b5\u03bb\u03bf\u03c2 \u03c4\u03b7\u03c2 \u03ba\u03cc\u03bb\u03b1\u03c3\u03b7\u03c2 [\u00e1ngelos tis k\u00f3lasis] \u2013 Reptile, (tortoise). Symbolising longevity, living up to 150 years and more, the tortoise in many Eastern cultures is also known as the Black Warrior, hence the appellation, Hells Angel. Named for the motor cycle macho men whose expertise at sand drag racing hardly mirrors the slow gait of the species, averaging 0.27&nbsp;km/hr, other characteristics reflect quite accurately the ultra masculine, whichever its gender\nTheir black protective shell resembles Shogun head gear, with tiny horn shaped vodka bottle receptors that send low sound vibrations to the Hells Angel's eardrums. The legs of the reptile from which they evolved are the sound receptors. The Hells Angel has a long protruding tail in which its exclusive diet of plastic flowers is digested and stored, much like a fuel tank. \nIronically the females are usually larger than the males.\nTheir brain is small with no hippocampus, which anatomically enables behaviors such as emotion, learning, memory and spatial navigation. \nThey are known to have survived after decapitation for up to 6 months.\n\nSee http://plastikus.online\n\nUnfortunately an 'off target' outcome of the genetic engineering process has been the creation of plastic plants, which many of the creatures, such as the Hells Angel, prefer to eat rather than our disgusting plastic waste.\n\nThe humour in Ely's artworks draws the viewer into a deep engagement with the concerns of her practice.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}J.S.

Ely established her reputation as an environmental artist in the early 1970s through her work on the Murray Darling rivers.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Navdeep|first1=Shergill|title=Bonita Ely|url=http://www.daao.org.au/bio/bonita-ely/biography/?|website=Design and Art Australia Online|accessdate=8 March 2015}}</ref>  She has a diverse practice across various media and has often addressed feminist, environmental and socio-political issues.<ref>{{cite book|last1=van Wyk|first1=Susan|editor1-last=Gellatly,  Kelly|title=101 Contemporary Australian Artists|date=2012|publisher=National Gallery of Victoria}}</ref>\n\nHer work has been internationally exhibited, including in Documenta14 in Kassel, Germany and Athens, at [[Chisenhale Gallery]], London, Kunstlerhaus Bethanien, Berlin, Harbourfront, Toronto, the 18th Street Arts Centre, Los Angeles, USA and the [[National Museum of Modern and Contemporary Art]], Seoul, Korea.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Barkley|first1=Glenn|title=Tell Me Tell Me: Australian and Korean Art 1976-2011|date=2011|publisher=Museum of Contemporary Art Sydney|location=Sydney}}</ref>\n\nEly's experimental artworks are in international collections, such as the [[Museum of Modern Art]], New York, the [[National Gallery of Australia]], Canberra, and has been selected for significant contemporary art events such as Fieldwork, the opening of the [[Ian Potter Centre]] for Australian Art, Federation Square, Melbourne. She has also produced three public sculptures for the City of Hue, [[Vietnam]] (1998, 2002, 2006).<ref name=\"Bonita Ely\">{{cite web|title=Bonita Ely|url=http://www.scanlines.net/person/bonita-ely|website=Scanlines|accessdate=8 March 2015}}</ref>\n\n==Art career==\nEly's first exhibition was in London in 1972, but recognition of her artwork in Australia effectively started at the Mildura Sculpture Triennial of 1975.<ref name=\"Bonita Ely\"/> Her interdisciplinary installation, ''C20th Mythological Beasts: at Home with the Locust People'' (1975) had its beginnings in New York where Bonita Ely lived from 1973 to 1975.<ref>{{cite web|title=Bonita Ely|url=http://www.videoartchive.org.au/bely/|website=Australian Video Art Online|accessdate=8 March 2015}}</ref>\n\nHer performances of the 1970s and 1980s were concerned primarily with environmental and political issues. For instance in her performance, Jabiluka UO2, [1979] she explored issues surrounding Aboriginal Land Rights and uranium mining in the Northern Territory.<ref name=\"Body and Self\">{{cite book|last1=Marsh|first1=Anne|title=Body and Self: Performance Art in Australia 1969-92|date=1993|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Melbourne, Australia|page=143}}</ref>\n\nIn her work  ''Breadline'' (1980) themes of womanhood and pregnancy were examined. Ely cast and moulded shapes of her body in bread dough which she washed off in a bath of milk. During this action bread was baked then served to viewers after the performance. As a complex exploration of women's traditional roles, the performance is both a celebration of motherhood and nurture, and  a critique of woman as a consumable product of culture.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Engberg|first1=Juliana|title=Breadline: Women and Food|journal=Artlink|date=1999|volume=19|issue=4}}</ref> ''Murray River Punch'' (1980) is one of Ely's most well known and significant performances.<ref>{{cite web|title=Murry River Punch|url=http://www.ngv.vic.gov.au/col/work/91051|website=National Gallery of Victoria|accessdate=8 March 2015}}</ref> The work was first performed at Melbourne University's George Paton Gallery in June 1980 as part of a week of performance titled ''Women at Work''.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Burke|first1=Janine|title=Field of vision: a decade of change : women's art in the seventies|date=1990|publisher=Viking|location=Ringwood, Vic., Australia|isbn=0 670 835862|page=94}}</ref> In this work the artist set up a cooking demonstration in the university's Student Union foyer at lunchtime and assumed the role of a cooking demonstrator who narrates the recipe for a \u2018punch\u2019 drink, the ingredients coming from pollutants in the Murray River.\n\nThe Murray River, one of the world's longest rivers (2,700&nbsp;km) has been an enduring focus of her practice, most recently  addressing its declining health during the Millennium Drought when environmentally unsustainable agricultural practices exacerbated acid sulphate contamination and outbreaks of blue green algae. Bonita Ely's forensic research along the length of the river resulted in a photographic series titled 'The Murray's Edge'. A reprise of 'Murray River Punch'  with the subtitle, 'the C21st', produced a tasty (not) dip due to a scarcity of water, the ingredients all the pollutants in the river.\n\nIn ''Dogwoman Communicates with the Younger Generation'' (1981), and ''Dogwoman Makes History'' (1983), the anthropomorphised fascination with another species was documented, alongside the gendered construction of history, using images of dogs in the art of Berlin museums, documented whilst artist in residence at Kunstlerhaus Bethanien, Berlin.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Marsh|first1=Anne|title=Body and Self: Performance Art in Australia 1969\u201392|date=1993|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Melbourne, Australia|isbn=9780195535068|page=146}}</ref>\n\nIn 1998 Bonita Ely was invited to create a public sculpture for the Children's Cultural Centre in Hue, Vietnam, participating in the 2nd Sculpture Symposium. Her interactive work takes the form of a hollow haystack, referencing the conical stacks made of rice 'hay' in the fields around Hue that were used for cooking fires, not animal feed. The sculpture's three arch shaped entrances are approximately one metre high, children's height, and its barrel shaped base acts like an acoustic chamber, collecting the sounds in the environment surrounding it. Small holes in the conical space above illumine the interior with soft bands of light. The sculpture is made from the small, traditional bricks from the Citadel's brickworks. As such it is a record of bygone cultural materials & practices.\n\nResearch of Hue's longevity characters informed another public sculpture in Hue titled \"Longevity: Scissors and Sickles\" (2002). Scissors and sickles made by local blacksmiths were caste and braised together in a lattice pattern to form a three dimensional interpretation of a longevity symbol. Shaped like a gourd, the scrap metal used included shrapnel from the American War, as the Vietnamese call it.\n\nIn 2006 Bonita was invited back for Hue's 4th International Sculpture Symposium, where her sculpture glows in the dark using solar paint \u2013 a sceptre of the Earth's energies at night. The title, \"Lake Thunder\" brings the sculpture's site, Thuy Tien Lake, into focus as an essential aspect of the work. The conjunction of lake and thunder also refers to traditional Taoist philosophical principals:\n\"THUNDER stands for our true essence, LAKE stands for our true sense, WATER stands for our real knowledge, and FIRE stands for our conscious knowledge. These four are the true 'four forms' inherent in us.\" \n[from the Inner Teachings of Taoism, Chang Po-Tuan, Shambala Books, 1986]\n\nThis zig zag symbol, warning of the danger of electricity, began its permutations in a three part installation, \"We Live to be Surprised\" in Performance Space, Sydney in 1991. Nine red thunderbolts shoot out of the floor. In the space opposite, 'snabbits' - genetically engineered creatures combining the snail's legless body and rabbit's head - hide in ruins. They are the only living creatures left on Earth. A short story tells us they are an excellent source of food in the future's dystopian environments as they cannot escape and are delicious. Between the thunderbolts and the snabbits' habitat,  viewers pass through a corridor of golden light, a liminal space  between energy and entropy.\n\nIn 2010 Bonita Ely was selected to create a public artwork to celebrate the 10th Anniversary of Sydney's Green Olympics. Made from a recycled windmill, the 'Thunderbolt' is powered by solar energy, the sculpture's lighting signals to the community their level of energy consumption  in the neighborhood at night, changing colour from green to yellow to red.\n\nThese environmental works are informed by Ely's cross cultural research of our relationship to land, first tracing the narratives inscribed upon natural landscapes in Australia's Aboriginal mythologies, or song lines, that weave across tribal nations' countries, functioning as ethical, spiritual, and practical narratives used to navigate across complex terrain, embedding environmental knowledges essential for food gathering, hunting, reading the seasons, the winds, etc. Similarly in India's Hindu mythologies, Chinese and Japanese gardens, Europe's pre-Christian animistic belief systems, the landscape was/is inscribed with meaning. The installation, \"Juggernaut\" , shown in Sydney, Melbourne, Brisbane and the Asian Biennale of Contemporary Art, Dhaka, Bangladesh (1999),  evoked this inscription of terrain. Each giant, spiralling turn transforms its internal spatial form, its peripatetic force simultaneous to a sense of fragility - the giant spirals are kept in place with wedges at floor level and spacers held in tension between each turn of the spiral, so the sculpture's structural integrity is in 'suspended animation'.\n\nBonita Ely's recent installations exhibited in Documenta14, 2017, are 'Interior Decoration' in the Palais Bellevue in Kassel, Germany, and in Athens, 'Plastikus Progressus'.\n\n'Interior Decoration' investigates the inter-generational affects of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD).\n\n\u201cPTSD typically leads to emotional numbing, \u2026 recurrent nightmares, substance abuse (traditionally, alcoholism), \u2026 delusional outbursts of violence.\u201d (Goldstein, 2001).\n \nThe installation, 'Interior Decoration' is embedded into the domestic environment of the Palais Bellevue. It explores the inter generational affects of untreated post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) suffered, for example, by war veterans, refugees, Indigenous people, displaced people, victims of genocide. Constructed from domestic objects, the military is domesticated, the domestic militarised. For example, 'Sewing Machine Gun' is made from the conjunction of a Singer sewing machine, a woman's industry, bobbypins, her intimate femininity, to create a Vickers machine gun, problematising the encodings of these objects to present the viewer with emotionally charged conundrums reflective of complexities rather than a didactic illustration of gendered conflict. Similarly the bedroom furniture turned inside-out forms polished wooden tunnel-like trenches, hiding places, all surveyed by the ladder-less 'Watchtower', made from a marriage bed, its floor the wire springs of a child's cot mattress. The installation embeds the viewer in the uncanny feelings of an adult transported back to childhood, inviting exploration to uncover its multiplicities.\n\nThe sculptural components are contextualised by a dado around the room composed of a visual narrative addressing trauma, and the names of Kassel's Jewish people deported and killed during WW2.  Their names are inscribed on a section of railway tracks at the KulturBahnhof (Kassel Central Station), an installation by Dr. Horst Hoheisel, 'Das Ged\u00e4chtnis der Gleise' (2015) - 'The Memory of the Tracks'.   'Interior Decoration' is a reminder of PTSD as a ubiquitous yet under acknowledged cause of conflict and suffering  in social and personal relations.\n\nThe installation, 'Plastikus Progressus' in the Athens iteration of Documenta14 is exhibited in the Athens School of Fine Arts Gallery. It addresses the contribution of casual littering to the plastics pollution of the trans-ecology of water.  Set in the year 2054, it takes the form of a natural history display. A diorama features plastic eating creatures, their physiologies built on vacuum cleaners & the parts thereof the artist found discarded on Sydney's streets. The creatures have been genetically  engineered using the CRISPR method to clean up the plastics polluting oceans  and rivers. The diorama is contextualised by photographs of pristine nature as it would have been in 1905, the year bakelite was invented, plus case studies of rivers in Athens, Kassel and Sydney, 2017, showing plastic pollution off city streets floating towards the ocean, contextualised by a world history from 2000BC to 2054AD showing the emergence, dominance then decline of nations, ending in 2054 with plastic filled, swirling gyres.\n\nEach genetically modified creature is described in a taxonomy presented on a touch screen. For example, the taxonomy of the creature called Hells Angel - Classification: Inferna angelus  : Common name, Hells Angel; \u03ac\u03b3\u03b3\u03b5\u03bb\u03bf\u03c2 \u03c4\u03b7\u03c2 \u03ba\u03cc\u03bb\u03b1\u03c3\u03b7\u03c2 [\u00e1ngelos tis k\u00f3lasis] \u2013 Reptile, (tortoise). Symbolising longevity, living up to 150 years and more, the tortoise in many Eastern cultures is also known as the Black Warrior, hence the appellation, Hells Angel. Named for the motor cycle macho men whose expertise at sand drag racing hardly mirrors the slow gait of the species, averaging 0.27&nbsp;km/hr, other characteristics reflect quite accurately the ultra masculine, whichever its gender\nTheir black protective shell resembles Shogun head gear, with tiny horn shaped vodka bottle receptors that send low sound vibrations to the Hells Angel's eardrums. The legs of the reptile from which they evolved are the sound receptors. The Hells Angel has a long protruding tail in which its exclusive diet of plastic flowers is digested and stored, much like a fuel tank. \nIronically the females are usually larger than the males.\nTheir brain is small with no hippocampus, which anatomically enables behaviors such as emotion, learning, memory and spatial navigation. \nThey are known to have survived after decapitation for up to 6 months.\n\nSee http://plastikus.online\n\nUnfortunately an 'off target' outcome of the genetic engineering process has been the creation of plastic plants, which many of the creatures, such as the Hells Angel, prefer to eat rather than our disgusting plastic waste.\n\nThe humour in Ely's artworks draws the viewer into a deep engagement with the concerns of her practice.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}J.S.
