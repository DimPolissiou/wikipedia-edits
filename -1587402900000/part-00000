Alkiza is an independent municipality since 1731; previously it depended on [[Tolosa, Gipuzkoa|Tolosa]] and San Sebastian.\n\nAlkiza is connected with [[Anoeta]] and [[Asteasu]] through the GI-3630 road. The Asteasu branch was inaugurated in 1952 and the Anoeta branch in 1957. Until then, farm roads and paths linked Alkiza with the nearby villages.\n\nThe village is 340 meters above sea level and there are the school, the town hall, the pelota-court and the parish church. The municipality has more than 40 scattered farms and houses.\n\nIts inhabitants are nicknamed in Basque ''oiloak'' (chickens).\n\nThe village\u2019s main festival is on September 8.\n\n== Geography ==\nAlkiza is located in the east of [[Hernio|Hernio-Gazume]] massif. The municipal area is mostly steep, with the flattest area in ''Arana'' neighborhood.\n\nThe local climate is typically [[Oceanic climate|Oceanic]].\n\nAs Hernio is a limestone formation, there are in Alkiza numerous [[karst]] structures such as [[Cave|caves]], chasms and [[sinkholes]]. The ''Leize Haundia 2 / Sabe-saia'' complex is the most important karst structure in Alkiza. The two caves form a system 340 m deep, 2 km of galleries and a stream inside<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Galan|first=Carlos &, Villota, Jaime|date=|title=Complejo Leize-Aundia - Sabe-Saia|url=|journal=Munibe|volume=XXII|pages=175 -182|via=}}</ref>.\n\nThe most outstanding summits in the municipality are Herniozabal (1,010 m), Herniotxiki (820 m), Enaizpuru (731 m), Alluts (687 m) and Beleburu (619 m) to the west and Mendiola (431 m) to the east. \n\nA quarter of the surface of Hernio-Gazume Special Conservation Zone ([[Natura 2000|Nature 2000]]) is located in the municipality of Alkiza.\n\n=== Hydrology ===\nAs mentioned above, Alkiza is a karst area, so the rain and thaw waters go underground to a large extent. For this reason, some streams and creeks only carry water in the event of intense precipitation and, in others, there are surface waters only in some sections of the course.\n\nThere are two main streams in Alkiza:\n\n* ''Mandabe'' stream runs through ''Arana'' neighborhood and discharges its waters in Anoeta to [[Oria (river)|Oria]] river. It is born in the source called ''Bidania erreka'', where the waters of the ''Leize / Haundia 2 / Sabe-saia'' complex emerge. Among the inhabitants of Alkiza it was thought that the waters of this source came from the other side of Hernio, specifically from the village of [[Bidania-Goiatz|Bidania]], and hence its name.\n* ''Aranguren'' stream is born next to the farmhouse of the same name and runs through ''Aldapa'' neighborhood.\u00a0 It pours its waters into Asteasu stream, a tributary of Oria river. This stream is called ''Arraiaga'' downstream of the ''Egurrola'' bridge.\n\n=== Adjacent municipalities ===\nAlkiza limits to the north with [[Larraul]] and Asteasu; to the south with [[Hernialde]], Tolosa, [[Albiztur]] and Bidania-Goiatz; to the east with Anoeta; and to the west with [[Errezil]].\n\n== History<ref>{{Cite book|last=Aranburu Ugartemendia|first=Pello Joxe|title=Alkiza auzo eta hiribilduaren azterketa historikoa (1348-1950)|publisher=Alkizako Udala|year=2001|isbn=84-606-3058-7|location=|pages=}}</ref>==\nThe first human footprints in Alkiza date back to the [[Bronze Age]]. Ceramic pieces in the Olatzazpi cave and the [[Tumulus|burial mound]] of the place called Itzuregi are an example of this.\n\nThe first written references to Alkiza are from 1348. In fact, by order of the King of [[Castile (historical region)|Castile]] [[Alfonso XI of Castile|Alfonso XI]], the list of noblemen of Tolosa was drawn up. In this list there are several Alkiza households. Alkiza is mentioned administratively associated to Tolosa. In 1396 Tolosa recognized Alkiza the right to choose its judges. Because of taxes Alkiza and other villages of Tolosaldea had disputes with Tolosa since 1435. Within this process, in 1450, Alkiza decided to join San Sebasti\u00e1n, but this did not materialize legally until in 1479.\n\nBetween the XV and XVIII centuries, Alkiza self-governed as an open council, although judges and aldermen were also appointed for everyday decisions.\n\nAt the end of the first third of the 18th century, the most important moment in the history of Alkiza arrived: it became a municipality. On January 21, 1731, Alkiza was declared a villa by King [[Philip V of Spain|Philip V]] and separated from San Sebasti\u00e1n. The distance to San Sebasti\u00e1n was the most important reason to carry out this secession. Miguel Irazusta was the first mayor. That same year, the limits of Alqiiza with the villages in the area were officially defined and each of the cairns was signalled. The Asteasu boundary, for example, was delimited by the cairns of ''Olatza, Arizmendi, Zalminaga'' and ''Arraiaga''. 54 houses constituted the new municipality.\n\nBy becoming an independent municipality, Alkiza acquired the right to participate in the [[General Assembly of Gipuzkoa]]. This had an economic cost and Alkiza proposed Anoeta to join and to share expenses. In 1742 the two villages founded the ''Ainssu'' union for their representation in the General Assembly. In 1815 Hernialde joined Ainssu and the enlarged union was called ''Ainssuberreluz''.\n\nAt the beginning of the 19th century, the [[communal land]] was privatized in Alkiza. The first movement occurred because of the debts derived from the [[War of the Pyrenees|War of the Convention]], and so in 1797 the local assembly authorized the City Council to sell communal land. The first auction of communal land was held in 1799 and the City Council sold 53 lots. From that date until 1814 the City Council held six auctions for the alienation of communal land. In 1810, other goods were auctioned, such as the ''Olaa'' and ''Goiko Errota'' mills in ''Aldapa'' neighborhood and ''Igaran'' in ''Arana'' neighborhood. At the end of the 18th century, half of the municipality's land was public and between 1799 and 1845 the City Council auctioned 682 communal plots, 5.3 km<sup>2</sup>. The communal land was reduced to an area of 0.4 km<sup>2</sup>.\n\nThis privatization seriously affected the economy of the city council. In fact, the council obtained great economic resources by selling firewood, charcoal, chestnuts and others. This caused, for example, in 1801 the loss of the resident [[Notary|notaries]] that Alkiza had since 1749. The forest guards responsible for the municipal forests and nurseries also disappeared.\n\nThe two [[Carlist Wars|Carlist wars]] of the 19th century had little effect on Alkiza. Although, in the Third Carlist War, the so-called Alkiza encounter happened in 1873. The Carlist guerrilla leader Santa Cruz priest was suspected to be somewhere in Hernio area and the ''miqueletes'' (police corp) and the liberal troops went looking for him. They found no one and decided to descend from Zelatun pass to Alkiza. Upon entering the village they were greeted with shots, but the liberals expelled the Carlists carrying a charge in bayonet. On the other hand, it was frequent that Santa Cruz took shelter in the priest's house of Alkiza, whose parish priest was a fervent Carlist.\n\nThe mail service started in 1873 with two postmen. One of them made the Azpeitia-Alquiza-Larraul-Asteasu route and the other, Tolosa-Alquiza-Larraul-Asteasu.\n\nIn 1885 the city council decided to bring up the [[Telegraphy|telegraph]] and [[telephone]] to the village. These services were based in the municipal tavern. The phone was not extended to all households in the municipality until the beginning of the decade of 1980.\n\nin 1911 four local entrepreneurs built a [[Hydroelectricity|hydroelectric power station]] in the course of Mandabe stream. In this way, households of Alkiza were supplied with electric power. This plant was a pioneer of the current ''Elektralkiza'' hydroelectrid power station. Alkiza was supplied with electrical energy produced by Mandabe stream until 1971 when the Spanish large power company ''Iberduero'' installed two transformation centers in the municipality.\nThe first motorcar arrived in Alkiza on November 2, 1930.\n\n== Administrative organization ==\nIn 1775 the City Council issued a decree that organized the collection of fern, dead leaves, and the like for the livestock beddings from the communal land. In it, the municipality was divided into four neighbourhoods: Azaldegi, Aldapa, Arana Behea and Arana Goikoa. \n\nAt the time the quotas for the payment of the local doctor were established in 1847, the municipality was divided again into four neighbourhoods: Azaldegi, Aldapa, Arana and Herriburua. In 1884 Aldapa neighbourhood was divided into two: Aldapa and Hernio. Sakamidra neighbourhood was set up in 1940, bringing together several farmhouses from Arana and Azaldegi.\n\nIn addition to the urban nucleus, called ''Plaza'' by the neighbours, Alkiza is currently officially divided into five neighbourhoods: ''Aldapa'' (it borders Larraul), ''Arana'' (flat area on the Anoeta road), ''Azaldegi'' (on both sides of the road to Asteasu), ''Hernio'' (at the foot of Hernio) and ''Sakamidra'' (adjacent to Goi-bailara neighbourhood of Anoeta).\n\n== Demography ==\nAt the time the first written documentation about Alkiza appeared, that is to say in the 14th century, it is estimated that it had about 60 inhabitants; at the beginning of the 17th century there were around 230 and when it was established as a municipality, about 270. At the beginning of the 19th century, more than 350 people lived in Alkiza. The first exact data on the number of inhabitants are from the mid-19th century. The following table shows the evolution of the population of Alkiza since 1851.<graph>{\"version\":2,\"width\":733,\"height\":331.7,\"data\":[{\"name\":\"table\",\"values\":[{\"x\":1851,\"y\":648},{\"x\":1860,\"y\":611},{\"x\":1900,\"y\":522},{\"x\":1920,\"y\":476},{\"x\":1940,\"y\":494},{\"x\":1960,\"y\":401},{\"x\":1970,\"y\":341},{\"x\":1981,\"y\":272},{\"x\":1991,\"y\":242},{\"x\":2001,\"y\":256},{\"x\":2011,\"y\":365},{\"x\":2019,\"y\":375}]}],\"scales\":[{\"name\":\"x\",\"type\":\"ordinal\",\"range\":\"width\",\"zero\":false,\"domain\":{\"data\":\"table\",\"field\":\"x\"}},{\"name\":\"y\",\"type\":\"linear\",\"range\":\"height\",\"nice\":true,\"domain\":{\"data\":\"table\",\"field\":\"y\"}}],\"axes\":[{\"type\":\"x\",\"scale\":\"x\"},{\"type\":\"y\",\"scale\":\"y\"}],\"marks\":[{\"type\":\"rect\",\"from\":{\"data\":\"table\"},\"properties\":{\"enter\":{\"x\":{\"scale\":\"x\",\"field\":\"x\"},\"y\":{\"scale\":\"y\",\"field\":\"y\"},\"y2\":{\"scale\":\"y\",\"value\":0},\"fill\":{\"value\":\"steelblue\"},\"width\":{\"scale\":\"x\",\"band\":\"true\",\"offset\":-1}}}}]}</graph>Since the beginning of the 20th century, the population has been decreasing gradually, a decrease that accelerated from the 1960s to the end of the century. The number of inhabitants reached the minimum in 1991, with only 242.\nAt the beginning of the 21st century, the population of Alquiza was comparable to the one it had when it became a municipality. This has a simple explanation from the point of view of the economic and family structure of the municipality. From the middle of the 20th century, agriculture ceased to be the engine of the local economy. The alkizarras began to go to work in both industry and services located in nearby towns such as Asteasu, Anoeta or Tolosa. At the same time the large families the rural economy needs began to shrink, from six to seven offspring to just two or three.\n\n== Economy ==\nUntil the middle of the 20<sup>th</sup> century, [[agriculture]] and related activities such as [[Blacksmith|blacksmithing]] or [[Water mills|watermills]] were Alkiza's main economic activities.\n\nAgrarian activity was organized around the [[farm]] and it was largely a [[subsistence economy]]. They used to live on what the farm produced. Unlike in other Gipuzkoan regions, it doesn\u2019t seem that [[Shepherd|shepherding]] had a great weight in the economy of the Alkiza farms.\n\nAlkiza has historically three mills: Igaran, in ''Arana'' neighbourhood on Mandabe stream, and Olaa and Goiko Errota in ''Aldapa'' neighbourhood on Aranguren stream. These last two mills were active until 1953. Corn and wheat were ground.\n\nIn the 16th century, it is worth noting the Egurrola [[forge]], which had a very important activity between 1511 and 1615. The forge were destroyed by a large flood.\n\n[[Charcoal]] was an important monetary supplement for the farmers of Alkiza, who sold the it to the industry and homes in nearby municipalities such as Tolosa. Wood from the forests of Hernio is a very suitable raw material for the manufacture of charcoal. This activity shaped the structure of Alkiza's forests, imposing pollard [[Beech|beech trees]]. This activity survived until the early 1960s. In the 1950s, a dozen and a half charcoal bunkers could been lit at the same time.\n\nBetween 1945 and 1950 a group of entrepreneurs, including the mayor of Alkiza, Mateo Aranburu, built a system of cables, pulleys and posts used to take down beech wood from the forests of Hernio to the ''Konporta'' farmhouse in Asteasu. This wood was sold to bakeries and used to cook bread.\n\nIn the last decades of the 20th century, Alkiza had a small [[Industrial park|industrial estate]] next to the Umanea neighbourhood of Asteasu, which is no longer active. ''Baldosas Jarri'' was the main local company.\n\nAt present, Alkiza has a very weak economic activity of its own and the locals work mainly outside the municipality, mainly in the industry and services of the region. It is worth noting the presence of a significant group of university professors among the residents of Alkiza.\nIn 2020, two farms, the Lete rural hotel, Inazio Urruzola Txakoli winery<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://inaziourruzola.eus/?lang=en|title=I.Urruzola - Inazio Urruzola Txakoli\u00f1a basque wine and winery near san sebastian alkiza restaurant|website=Inazio Urruzola Txakoli\u00f1a|language=en-US|access-date=2020-04-19}}</ref>, the municipal restaurant, ''Elektralkiza'' mini hydroelectric plant and a sharpening company make up the productive fabric of Alkiza.\n\n== Politics ==\nSince Alkiza became an independent municipality citizens got the right of electing the [[mayor]]. As mentioned above, the first mayor was Miguel de Irazusta, an alkizarra architect based in Madrid. The municipal ordinances established that the successive mayors had to reside in the town, in such a way that Jer\u00f3nimo Alkizalete succeeded Irazusta. Until the mid-nineteenth century, mayors were elected in the first days of the calendar year and to be candidates they had to be noblemen and first-class farmhouse owners. They were chosen for one year, although there are some exceptions, for example Gregorio Arantzabe was chosen for 1808 and 1809.\n\nIn 1845, after the First Carlist War, the electoral system changed and, among other things, the mandate of the mayors was prolonged.\n\nIn 1931, in the municipal elections that led to the proclamation of the [[Second Spanish Republic|Second Spanish  Republic,]] Krispin Sorarrain was elected mayor until 1934. Jos\u00e9 Tolosa followed. On August 27, 1936, after the [[Spanish Civil War]] broke out, the Junta de Burgos, authority faithful to the coup plotters, proceeded to dismiss Jos\u00e9 Tolosa and the other councilors: Krispin Sorarrain, Jos\u00e9 Luis Iruretagoiena and Sim\u00f3n Ugalde, and to appoint as mayor, Mat\u00edas Aranburu.\nAt the end of the [[Francoist Spain|Franco regime]], in the first municipal elections (1979), Bittor Sorarrain Lasa, nephew of Krispin, was elected mayor standing in the independent list ''Alkizako Herriaren Alde''. Antonio Zubiaurre Otegi was mayor of Alkiza from 1983 until his death in 2004, on behalf of [[Euskadiko Ezkerra]] first and of the independent list ''Alkizako Abertzale Ezkertiarrak'' (Alkiza's National Left) since 1995. In 2004 Jon Roteta took possession of the mayor's office and remained in office until 2011. In the 2011 and 2015 elections, Jon Um\u00e9rez Urrezola was elected mayor and Inaki Irazabalbeitia Fern\u00e1ndez<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.europarl.europa.eu/meps/en/119875/INAKI_IRAZABALBEITIA+FERNANDEZ/history/7|title=7th parliamentary term {{!}} I\u00f1aki IRAZABALBEITIA FERN\u00c1NDEZ {{!}} MEPs {{!}} European Parliament|website=www.europarl.europa.eu|language=en|access-date=2020-04-19}}</ref> in the 2019 elections. Since 1995, all the municipal elected officials in Alkiza have been elected in the list of ''Alkizako Abertzale Ezkertiarrak.''\n\nIn the elections to the General Assembly of Gipuzkoa, the [[Basque Parliament]], the [[Cortes Generales|Cortes]] and the [[European Parliament|European Parliament,]] the vote for Basque national lists easily exceeds 80% of the votes casted.\n\n== Education ==\nShortly after being declared town, Alquiza\u2019s city council decided to take care of the education of its inhabitants. In 1749, in the agreement with the first resident notary of the town, Francisco Ignacio Larrunbide, it is mentioned that said notary had to teach reading and writing as well. \n\nThis was so until 1797 when the city council appointed the first teacher who was not a notary: Juan Antonio Irazusta. The agreement that he signed with the city council details his obligations and rights: to teach children Christian doctrine and to read, write and count. Except in the case of poor families, all families had to pay in wheat to the teacher who also received the salary stipulated by the city council. At that epoch the school was located at the council building. The teacher also had the function of keeping the clock on the church tower.\n\nIn 1816 the brothers and neighbours of the town Juan Bautista and Jos\u00e9 Antonio Legarra had ''Migelena'' house rebuilt. The school was moved to that house and the parish priest Juan Bautista Legarra served as a teacher between 1822 and 1843. In addition to the teacher, a mistress was appointed to teach the girls. The first of them, between 1823 and 1846, was Juana Mar\u00eda Aranburu. In his will, Juan Bautista Legarra ceded to the municipality the school building, already known as ''Donjuanena'', for use as an school.\n\nThe school stayed at ''Donjuanena'' until 1930 when a new one was built on the plot of Madrigal house.\n\nIn March 2020, a new building was opened for use by the [[Basque Government|Basque Governmen]]<nowiki/>t Department of Education, which comes to replace the old one that had become small and out-dated. Alkiza\u2019s school offers [[Preschool education|preschool]] and [[primary education]]. Pupils older that 12 go mainly to [[Villabona]] or Tolosa for [[secondary education]].\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{commons category-inline}}\n* [http://www.alkiza.eus Official Website] Information available in [[Spanish language|Spanish]] and [[Basque language|Basque]].\n* [http://www.euskomedia.org/euskomedia/SAunamendi?idi=en&op=7&voz=ALKIZA ALKIZA in the Bernardo Estorn\u00e9s Lasa - Au\u00f1amendi Encyclopedia (Euskomedia Fundazioa)] Information available in [[Spanish language|Spanish]]\n\n{{Municipalities in Gipuzkoa}}\n\n{{coord|43|10|21|N|2|06|32|W|display=title|source:eswiki}}\n\n{{authority control}}\n\n[[Category:Municipalities in Gipuzkoa]]\n[[Category:Populated places in Gipuzkoa]]\n\n\n{{basque-geo-stub}}\n", "text_old": "[[File:Alkiza, Euskal Herria.JPG|thumb|Alkiza]]\n'''Alkiza''' is a rural municipality in the centre of [[Gipuzkoa]], northwest of the [[Tolosaldea]] County, in the [[Basque Country (autonomous community)|Basque Country.]] It is 27 kilometres south of [[San Sebasti\u00e1n|San Sebastian]].

Sakamidra neighbourhood was set up in 1940, bringing together several farmhouses from Arana and Azaldegi.\n\nIn addition to the urban nucleus, called ''Plaza'' by the neighbours, Alkiza is currently officially divided into five neighbourhoods: ''Aldapa'' (it borders Larraul), ''Arana'' (flat area on the Anoeta road), ''Azaldegi'' (on both sides of the road to Asteasu), ''Hernio'' (at the foot of Hernio) and ''Sakamidra'' (adjacent to Goi-bailara neighbourhood of Anoeta).\n\n== Demography ==\nAt the time the first written documentation about Alkiza appeared, that is to say in the 14th century, it is estimated that it had about 60 inhabitants; at the beginning of the 17th century there were around 230 and when it was established as a municipality, about 270. At the beginning of the 19th century, more than 350 people lived in Alkiza. The first exact data on the number of inhabitants are from the mid-19th century. The following table shows the evolution of the population of Alkiza since 1851.<graph>{\"version\":2,\"width\":733,\"height\":331.7,\"data\":[{\"name\":\"table\",\"values\":[{\"x\":1851,\"y\":648},{\"x\":1860,\"y\":611},{\"x\":1900,\"y\":522},{\"x\":1920,\"y\":476},{\"x\":1940,\"y\":494},{\"x\":1960,\"y\":401},{\"x\":1970,\"y\":341},{\"x\":1981,\"y\":272},{\"x\":1991,\"y\":242},{\"x\":2001,\"y\":256},{\"x\":2011,\"y\":365},{\"x\":2019,\"y\":375}]}],\"scales\":[{\"name\":\"x\",\"type\":\"ordinal\",\"range\":\"width\",\"zero\":false,\"domain\":{\"data\":\"table\",\"field\":\"x\"}},{\"name\":\"y\",\"type\":\"linear\",\"range\":\"height\",\"nice\":true,\"domain\":{\"data\":\"table\",\"field\":\"y\"}}],\"axes\":[{\"type\":\"x\",\"scale\":\"x\"},{\"type\":\"y\",\"scale\":\"y\"}],\"marks\":[{\"type\":\"rect\",\"from\":{\"data\":\"table\"},\"properties\":{\"enter\":{\"x\":{\"scale\":\"x\",\"field\":\"x\"},\"y\":{\"scale\":\"y\",\"field\":\"y\"},\"y2\":{\"scale\":\"y\",\"value\":0},\"fill\":{\"value\":\"steelblue\"},\"width\":{\"scale\":\"x\",\"band\":\"true\",\"offset\":-1}}}}]}</graph>Since the beginning of the 20th century, the population has been decreasing gradually, a decrease that accelerated from the 1960s to the end of the century. The number of inhabitants reached the minimum in 1991, with only 242.\nAt the beginning of the 21st century, the population of Alquiza was comparable to the one it had when it became a municipality. This has a simple explanation from the point of view of the economic and family structure of the municipality. From the middle of the 20th century, agriculture ceased to be the engine of the local economy. The alkizarras began to go to work in both industry and services located in nearby towns such as Asteasu, Anoeta or Tolosa. At the same time the large families the rural economy needs began to shrink, from six to seven offspring to just two or three.\n\n== Economy ==\nUntil the middle of the 20<sup>th</sup> century, [[agriculture]] and related activities such as [[Blacksmith|blacksmithing]] or [[Water mills|watermills]] were Alkiza's main economic activities.\n\nAgrarian activity was organized around the [[farm]] and it was largely a [[subsistence economy]]. They used to live on what the farm produced. Unlike in other Gipuzkoan regions, it doesn\u2019t seem that [[Shepherd|shepherding]] had a great weight in the economy of the Alkiza farms.\n\nAlkiza has historically three mills: Igaran, in ''Arana'' neighbourhood on Mandabe stream, and Olaa and Goiko Errota in ''Aldapa'' neighbourhood on Aranguren stream. These last two mills were active until 1953. Corn and wheat were ground.\n\nIn the 16th century, it is worth noting the Egurrola [[forge]], which had a very important activity between 1511 and 1615. The forge were destroyed by a large flood.\n\n[[Charcoal]] was an important monetary supplement for the farmers of Alkiza, who sold the it to the industry and homes in nearby municipalities such as Tolosa. Wood from the forests of Hernio is a very suitable raw material for the manufacture of charcoal. This activity shaped the structure of Alkiza's forests, imposing pollard [[Beech|beech trees]]. This activity survived until the early 1960s. In the 1950s, a dozen and a half charcoal bunkers could been lit at the same time.\n\nBetween 1945 and 1950 a group of entrepreneurs, including the mayor of Alkiza, Mateo Aranburu, built a system of cables, pulleys and posts used to take down beech wood from the forests of Hernio to the ''Konporta'' farmhouse in Asteasu. This wood was sold to bakeries and used to cook bread.\n\nIn the last decades of the 20th century, Alkiza had a small [[Industrial park|industrial estate]] next to the Umanea neighbourhood of Asteasu, which is no longer active. ''Baldosas Jarri'' was the main local company.\n\nAt present, Alkiza has a very weak economic activity of its own and the locals work mainly outside the municipality, mainly in the industry and services of the region. It is worth noting the presence of a significant group of university professors among the residents of Alkiza.\nIn 2020, two farms, the Lete rural hotel, Inazio Urruzola Txakoli winery<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://inaziourruzola.eus/?lang=en|title=I.Urruzola - Inazio Urruzola Txakoli\u00f1a basque wine and winery near san sebastian alkiza restaurant|website=Inazio Urruzola Txakoli\u00f1a|language=en-US|access-date=2020-04-19}}</ref>, the municipal restaurant, ''Elektralkiza'' mini hydroelectric plant and a sharpening company make up the productive fabric of Alkiza.\n\n== Politics ==\nSince Alkiza became an independent municipality citizens got the right of electing the [[mayor]]. As mentioned above, the first mayor was Miguel de Irazusta, an alkizarra architect based in Madrid. The municipal ordinances established that the successive mayors had to reside in the town, in such a way that Jer\u00f3nimo Alkizalete succeeded Irazusta. Until the mid-nineteenth century, mayors were elected in the first days of the calendar year and to be candidates they had to be noblemen and first-class farmhouse owners. They were chosen for one year, although there are some exceptions, for example Gregorio Arantzabe was chosen for 1808 and 1809.\n\nIn 1845, after the First Carlist War, the electoral system changed and, among other things, the mandate of the mayors was prolonged.\n\nIn 1931, in the municipal elections that led to the proclamation of the [[Second Spanish Republic|Second Spanish  Republic,]] Krispin Sorarrain was elected mayor until 1934. Jos\u00e9 Tolosa followed. On August 27, 1936, after the [[Spanish Civil War]] broke out, the Junta de Burgos, authority faithful to the coup plotters, proceeded to dismiss Jos\u00e9 Tolosa and the other councilors: Krispin Sorarrain, Jos\u00e9 Luis Iruretagoiena and Sim\u00f3n Ugalde, and to appoint as mayor, Mat\u00edas Aranburu.\nAt the end of the [[Francoist Spain|Franco regime]], in the first municipal elections (1979), Bittor Sorarrain Lasa, nephew of Krispin, was elected mayor standing in the independent list ''Alkizako Herriaren Alde''. Antonio Zubiaurre Otegi was mayor of Alkiza from 1983 until his death in 2004, on behalf of [[Euskadiko Ezkerra]] first and of the independent list ''Alkizako Abertzale Ezkertiarrak'' (Alkiza's National Left) since 1995. In 2004 Jon Roteta took possession of the mayor's office and remained in office until 2011. In the 2011 and 2015 elections, Jon Um\u00e9rez Urrezola was elected mayor and Inaki Irazabalbeitia Fern\u00e1ndez<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.europarl.europa.eu/meps/en/119875/INAKI_IRAZABALBEITIA+FERNANDEZ/history/7|title=7th parliamentary term {{!}} I\u00f1aki IRAZABALBEITIA FERN\u00c1NDEZ {{!}} MEPs {{!}} European Parliament|website=www.europarl.europa.eu|language=en|access-date=2020-04-19}}</ref> in the 2019 elections. Since 1995, all the municipal elected officials in Alkiza have been elected in the list of ''Alkizako Abertzale Ezkertiarrak.''\n\nIn the elections to the General Assembly of Gipuzkoa, the [[Basque Parliament]], the [[Cortes Generales|Cortes]] and the [[European Parliament|European Parliament,]] the vote for Basque national lists easily exceeds 80% of the votes casted.\n\n== Education ==\nShortly after being declared town, Alquiza\u2019s city council decided to take care of the education of its inhabitants. In 1749, in the agreement with the first resident notary of the town, Francisco Ignacio Larrunbide, it is mentioned that said notary had to teach reading and writing as well. \n\nThis was so until 1797 when the city council appointed the first teacher who was not a notary: Juan Antonio Irazusta. The agreement that he signed with the city council details his obligations and rights: to teach children Christian doctrine and to read, write and count. Except in the case of poor families, all families had to pay in wheat to the teacher who also received the salary stipulated by the city council. At that epoch the school was located at the council building. The teacher also had the function of keeping the clock on the church tower.\n\nIn 1816 the brothers and neighbours of the town Juan Bautista and Jos\u00e9 Antonio Legarra had ''Migelena'' house rebuilt. The school was moved to that house and the parish priest Juan Bautista Legarra served as a teacher between 1822 and 1843. In addition to the teacher, a mistress was appointed to teach the girls. The first of them, between 1823 and 1846, was Juana Mar\u00eda Aranburu. In his will, Juan Bautista Legarra ceded to the municipality the school building, already known as ''Donjuanena'', for use as an school.\n\nThe school stayed at ''Donjuanena'' until 1930 when a new one was built on the plot of Madrigal house.\n\nIn March 2020, a new building was opened for use by the [[Basque Government|Basque Governmen]]<nowiki/>t Department of Education, which comes to replace the old one that had become small and out-dated. Alkiza\u2019s school offers [[Preschool education|preschool]] and [[primary education]]. Pupils older that 12 go mainly to [[Villabona]] or Tolosa for [[secondary education]].\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{commons category-inline}}\n* [http://www.alkiza.eus Official Website] Information available in [[Spanish language|Spanish]] and [[Basque language|Basque]].\n* [http://www.euskomedia.org/euskomedia/SAunamendi?idi=en&op=7&voz=ALKIZA ALKIZA in the Bernardo Estorn\u00e9s Lasa - Au\u00f1amendi Encyclopedia (Euskomedia Fundazioa)] Information available in [[Spanish language|Spanish]]\n\n{{Municipalities in Gipuzkoa}}\n\n{{coord|43|10|21|N|2|06|32|W|display=title|source:eswiki}}\n\n{{authority control}}\n\n[[Category:Municipalities in Gipuzkoa]]\n[[Category:Populated places in Gipuzkoa]]\n\n\n{{basque-geo-stub}}\n", "name_user": "InakiXabier", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eHistory", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alkiza"}

The song was written by Ocean and produced by [[Malay (producer)|Malay]] and [[Om'Mas Keith]]. The track features an uncredited [[guitar solo]] from singer [[John Mayer]]. On June 7, 2012, Ocean posted a small teaser video featuring a snippet of the song onto his [[Tumblr]] account, and released the full, nearly 10-minute song later that day onto his official [[SoundCloud]] account. The song explores a narrative of a [[pimp]] falling in love with one of his clients. The track lyrically contains several extended metaphors referencing [[Cleopatra VII|Cleopatra]], pyramids, and strip clubs. The song received highly positive reviews and was called epic in nature by several publications, who praised the ambition and scope of the track's length, along with the lyrical merit.\n\nThe song was featured in a teaser for Ocean's then-upcoming album and was released with a cover that featured ''[[The Simpsons]]'' style characters. The music video was directed by [[Nabil Elderkin]] and featured an orange car with an atmospheric background. The song has since debuted on the [[UK R&B Chart]] at number 31. The track has been featured during television promos for ''Channel Orange''. Ocean performed \"Pyramids\" during his ''Channel Orange'' tour through [[North America]].\n\n==Background==\nOn June 8, 2012, Ocean posted on his tumblr a cryptic, almost two-minute video, promoting an unknown project which was titled ''Channel Orange''.<ref name=\"spin\">{{cite web|url=https://www.spin.com/2012/06/frank-ocean-hints-channel-orange-release-sleek-video/|title=Frank Ocean Hints at 'Channel Orange' Release|last=Hogan|first=Marc|work=[[Spin (magazine)|Spin]]|publisher=Spin Media LLC|date=2012-06-08|accessdate=2011-08-04}}</ref> The clip featured an expensive-looking car, and it also contained new music.<ref name=\"spin\"/><ref>{{cite web|last=St. Asaph|first=Katherine|url=http://popdust.com/2012/06/08/frank-ocean-releases-trailer-for-something-or-other/|title=Frank Ocean releases trailer for something or toother|publisher=Popdust|date=2012-08-12|accessdate=2011-05-21}}</ref> Later that day Ocean posted the full song used in the video, titled \"Pyramids\" onto his [[SoundCloud]] account.<ref>{{cite web|last=Louche|first=Liz|url=http://www.tinymixtapes.com/news/frank-ocean-announces-new-album-channel-orange-tourdates|title=The greatest gift of all: Frank Ocean announces new album, tourdates|publisher=[[Tiny Mix Tapes]]|date=2012-06-03|accessdate=2011-08-19}}</ref><ref name=\"Complex\">{{cite web|author=Martin, Andre|title=1.

(2012). The song was written by Ocean and produced by [[Malay (producer)|Malay]] and [[Om'Mas Keith]]. The track features an uncredited [[guitar solo]] from singer [[John Mayer]]. On June 7, 2012, Ocean posted a small teaser video featuring a snippet of the song onto his [[Tumblr]] account, and released the full, nearly 10-minute song later that day onto his official [[SoundCloud]] account. The song explores a narrative of a [[pimp]] falling in love with one of his clients. The track lyrically contains several extended metaphors referencing [[Cleopatra VII|Cleopatra]], pyramids, and strip clubs. The song received highly positive reviews and was called epic in nature by several publications, who praised the ambition and scope of the track's length, along with the lyrical merit.\n\nThe song was featured in a teaser for Ocean's then-upcoming album and was released with a cover that featured ''[[The Simpsons]]'' style characters. The music video was directed by [[Nabil Elderkin]] and featured an orange car with an atmospheric background. The song has since debuted on the [[UK R&B Chart]] at number 31. The track has been featured during television promos for ''Channel Orange''. Ocean performed \"Pyramids\" during his ''Channel Orange'' tour through [[North America]].\n\n==Background==\nOn June 8, 2012, Ocean posted on his tumblr a cryptic, almost two-minute video, promoting an unknown project which was titled ''Channel Orange''.<ref name=\"spin\">{{cite web|url=https://www.spin.com/2012/06/frank-ocean-hints-channel-orange-release-sleek-video/|title=Frank Ocean Hints at 'Channel Orange' Release|last=Hogan|first=Marc|work=[[Spin (magazine)|Spin]]|publisher=Spin Media LLC|date=2012-06-08|accessdate=2011-08-04}}</ref> The clip featured an expensive-looking car, and it also contained new music.<ref name=\"spin\"/><ref>{{cite web|last=St. Asaph|first=Katherine|url=http://popdust.com/2012/06/08/frank-ocean-releases-trailer-for-something-or-other/|title=Frank Ocean releases trailer for something or toother|publisher=Popdust|date=2012-08-12|accessdate=2011-05-21}}</ref> Later that day Ocean posted the full song used in the video, titled \"Pyramids\" onto his [[SoundCloud]] account.<ref>{{cite web|last=Louche|first=Liz|url=http://www.tinymixtapes.com/news/frank-ocean-announces-new-album-channel-orange-tourdates|title=The greatest gift of all: Frank Ocean announces new album, tourdates|publisher=[[Tiny Mix Tapes]]|date=2012-06-03|accessdate=2011-08-19}}</ref><ref name=\"Complex\">{{cite web|author=Martin, Andre|title=1.

Existing social tensions and housing shortages were exacerbated by the arrival of nearly 400,000 migrants, both [[African-American]] and [[White Southerners]], from the [[Southeastern United States]] between 1941 and 1943. The new migrants competed for space and jobs, as well as against European immigrants and their descendants.\n\nThe Detroit riot was one of three that summer; it followed one in [[Beaumont Race Riot of 1943|Beaumont, Texas]], earlier that month, in which white shipyard workers attacked blacks after a rumor that a white woman had been raped; another riot preceded in [[Harlem riot of 1943|Harlem, New York]], where blacks attacked white-owned property in their neighborhood after rumors that a black soldier had been killed by a white policeman. In this wartime period, there were also [[Zoot Suit Riots|racial riots in Los Angeles, California]], and [[Mobile, Alabama#20th century|Mobile, Alabama]], in which the former involved white military men attacking young Hispanic civilians in [[zoot suit]]s simply due to their clothing.\n\nThe rioting in Detroit began among youths at [[Belle Isle Park]] on June 20, 1943; the unrest moved into the city proper and was exacerbated by false rumors of racial attacks in both the black and white communities. It continued until June 22. It was suppressed after 6,000 federal troops were ordered into the city to restore peace. A total of 34 people were killed, 25 of them black and most at the hands of the white police force; 433 were wounded, 75 percent of them black; and property valued at $2 million ($27.5 million in 2015 US dollars) was destroyed. Most of the riot took place in the black area of [[Black Bottom, Detroit|Paradise Valley]], the poorest neighborhood of the city.<ref name=\"capeci\">[https://www.jstor.org/stable/20173210?seq=1#page_scan_tab_contents Dominic J. Capeci, Jr., and Martha Wilkerson, \"The Detroit Rioters of 1943: A Reinterpretation\"], ''Michigan Historical Review,'' Jan 1990, Vol. 16 Issue 1, pp. 49-72.</ref>\n\nAt the time, white commissions mistakenly attributed the cause of the riot to black people and youths. But the [[NAACP]] identified deeper causes: a shortage of affordable housing, discrimination in employment, lack of minority representation in the police, and white police brutality. A late 20th-century analysis of the rioters showed that the white rioters were younger and often unemployed (characteristics that the riot commissions had falsely attributed to blacks, despite evidence in front of them). If working, the whites often held semi-skilled or skilled positions. Whites traveled long distances across the city to join the first stage of the riot near the bridge to Belle Isle Park, and later some traveled in armed groups explicitly to attack the black neighborhood in Paradise Valley. The black participants were often older, established city residents, who in many cases had lived in the city for more than a decade. Many were married working men and were defending their homes and neighborhood against police and white rioters. They also looted and destroyed white-owned property in their neighborhood.<ref name=\"capeci\"/>\n\n==Events leading up to the riot==\n[[File:White sign racial hatred..jpg|{{largethumb}}|Sign posted in response to proposed Sojourner Truth Housing Project, February 1942]]\n\nBy 1920, Detroit had become the fourth-largest city in the United States, with an industrial and population boom driven by the rapid expansion of the automobile industry.<ref name=\"jackson127\">[https://books.google.com/books/about/The_Ku_Klux_Klan_in_the_City_1915_1930.html?id=0TUL_pAiQ4AC Kenneth Jackson, ''The Ku Klux Klan in the City, 1915-1930''], Rowman & Littlefield, 1967, pp.127-129</ref> In this era of continuing high immigration from southern and eastern Europe, the [[Ku Klux Klan]] in the 1920s established a substantial presence in Detroit during its early 20th-century revival.<ref name=\"pbs\">[https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/americanexperience/features/general-article/eleanor-riots/ General Article: \"Detroit Riots 1943\"], ''Eleanor Roosevelt'', ''American Experience'', PBS</ref> The KKK became concentrated in midwestern cities rather than exclusively in the South.<ref name=\"jackson127\"/> It was primarily anti-Catholic and anti-Jewish in this period, but it also supported [[white supremacy]].\n\nThe KKK contributed to Detroit's reputation for racial antagonism, and there were violent incidents dating from 1915.<ref name=\"capeci\"/> Its lesser-known offshoot, [[Black Legion (political movement)|Black Legion]], was also active in the Detroit area. In 1936 and 1937, some 48 members were convicted of numerous murders and attempted murder, thus ending Black Legion's run. Both organizations stood for white supremacy. Detroit was unique among northern cities by the 1940s for its exceptionally high percentage of Southern-born residents, both black and white.<ref>Gunnar Myrdal, ''An American Dilemma: The Negro Problem and American Democracy'', New York: 1941, p. 568</ref>\n\nSoon after the U.S. entry into [[World War II]], the automotive industry was converted to military production; high wages were offered, attracting large numbers of workers and their families from outside of Michigan. The new workers found little available housing, and competition among ethnic groups was fierce for both jobs and housing. With [[Executive Order 8802]], President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] on June 25, 1941, had prohibited [[racism|racial discrimination]] in the national [[Military-industrial complex|defense industry]]. Roosevelt called upon all groups to support the war effort. The Executive Order was applied irregularly, and blacks were often excluded from numerous industrial jobs, especially more skilled and supervisory positions. Due to the severe labor shortage during the war, Detroit companies began employing African Americans, but they were typically given the most grueling and dangerous jobs with low pay. For the first time, blacks and whites were in constant close proximity, resulting in hostile everyday interracial encounters. Whites accused blacks of forming a \u201cbump club\u201d in which members would purposely bump and shove white people in public places, on sidewalks and on the bus. \n\n=== Growing population ===\nIn 1941 at the beginning of the war, blacks numbered nearly 150,000 in Detroit, which had a total population of 1,623,452. Many of the blacks had migrated from the South in 1915 to 1930 during the [[Great Migration (African American)|Great Migration]], as the auto industry opened up many new jobs. By summer 1943, after the United States had entered [[World War II]], tensions between whites and blacks in Detroit were escalating; blacks resisted discrimination, as well as oppression and violence by the [[Detroit Police Department]]. The police force of the city was overwhelmingly white and the black population resented this.\n\nIn the early 1940s, Detroit's population reached more than 2 million, absorbing more than 400,000 whites and some 50,000 black migrants, mostly from [[Southern United States|the American South]], where racial segregation was enforced by law.<ref name=\"capeci\"/> The more recent African Americans were part of the second wave of the black [[Great Migration (African American)|Great Migration]], joining 150,000 blacks already in the city. The early residents had been restricted by informal segregation and their limited finances to the poor and overcrowded East Side of the city. A 60-block area east of [[M-1 (Michigan highway)|Woodward Avenue]] was known as [[Black Bottom, Detroit|Paradise Valley]], and it had aging and substandard housing.\n\nWhite American migrants came largely from agricultural areas and especially rural Appalachia, carrying with them southern prejudices.<ref name=\"Sitkoff\">Sitkoff, \"The Detroit Race Riot 1943\"</ref> Rumors circulated among ethnic white groups to fear African Americans as competitors for housing and jobs. Blacks had continued to seek to escape the limited opportunities in the South, exacerbated by the [[Great Depression]] and second-class social status under [[Jim Crow laws]]. After arriving in Detroit, the new migrants found racial bigotry there, too. They had to compete for low-level jobs with numerous European immigrants or their descendants, in addition to rural southern whites. Blacks were excluded from all of the limited public housing except the [[Brewster-Douglass Housing Projects|Brewster Housing Projects]]. They were exploited by landlords and forced to pay rents that were two to three times higher than families paid in the less densely populated white districts. Like other poor migrants, they were generally limited to the oldest, substandard housing.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://apps.detnews.com/apps/history/index.php?id=185|title=The 1943 Detroit race riots|publisher=Detroit News|date=February 11, 1999|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120526204732/http://apps.detnews.com/apps/history/index.php?id=185|archivedate=May 26, 2012}}</ref>\n\n=== The Great Migration ===\nThe South changed very little after the [[American Civil War|Civil War]]. While slavery became illegal, the mentality of owning slaves in the South endured. The freedom of African Americans was more of an illusion than a reality, as they did not own land or have any source of income. As a result, many started working for the same people that enslaved them. Southern blacks migrated north in the 20th Century in hopes of leaving the oppressive culture in the South. Many considered Detroit to be the place of paradise, calling Detroit the \"New Canaan.\" During the Civil War, Detroit was an important stop on the [[Underground Railroad]], as many settled in the northern city or used it as a means to get to Canada. During World War II, it was sought out as a refuge for blacks seeking to escape the lingering effects of the Jim Crow era. The promise of employment and escape from the violent racial tensions in the South drew in many African American workers to the North. Before the war, black workers in Detroit were scarce: even in 1942, 119 of 197 Detroit manufacturers surveyed did not have any black employees. However, by 1943, Detroit's labor shortage had become so severe that companies finally began employing African Americans. A report in 1944 showed that with the 44% increase of wartime employment, black employment increased by 103%. [[Ford Motor Company]] was the leading manufacturer in black employment: half of all blacks in the auto industry in the U.S. were employed by Ford, and 12% of all Ford workers were black. Ford made sure to develop close ties with African Americans, being in contact with leading clergy at major black churches and using ministers as a screening process to obtain recommendations for the best potential workers. This ensured that Ford only employed reliable long-term workers who would be willing to do the most labor-intensive jobs. Around 1910, Ford gave a salary of $5 a day to its workers, which translates to over $120 today. Because of the city's growth in population and employment opportunities, Detroit became a symbol of cultural rebirth. The statement \u201cwhen I die, bury me in Detroit\u201d became popular among the black community for these reasons.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Sugrue |first1=Thomas |title=The Origins of the Urban Crisis |date=2014 |publisher=Princeton University Press |isbn=978-0-691-16255-3 |pages=25\u201327 |edition=First Princeton Classics}}</ref>\n\n=== World War II and Housing ===\nThe effect of World War II in Europe and Asia was felt heavily in the U.S. even before the [[attack on Pearl Harbor]]. The defense industry was growing rapidly because the country was immersed in a military buildup to provide assistance to their European and Asian allies.<ref name=\"britannica.com\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.britannica.com/event/Executive-Order-8802|title=Executive Order 8802 &#124; United States history|website=Encyclopedia Britannica}}</ref> On the [[home front]], African-Americans were subjected to low-level jobs with little security or protection against the discrimination and prejudice they faced in the work place. [[A. Philip Randolph]] and other civil rights leaders took this opportunity to speak with President Roosevelt about expanding opportunities for African-Americans by outlawing discrimination in the defense industry. At first, the president was hesitant to agree due to his political alignments but changed his mind when Randolph threatened a large march on the nation\u2019s capital.<ref name=\"britannica.com\"/> After President Roosevelt signed Executive Order 8802 which prohibited racial discrimination within the defense industry, he was then preoccupied with providing adequate housing for the new additions to the workforce. Housing in many cities was substandard, especially for people of color. Housing in Detroit was strained as both blacks and whites moved from southern states to Detroit to work in the booming manufacturing industry in the city. African-Americans were unable to buy houses in the suburbs during the majority of the 20th century due to racially biased practices, such as [[redlining]] and restrictive [[Covenant (law)|covenants]]. They had no choice but to live in substandard housing in downtown Detroit in an area more commonly known as Black Bottom. Properties in the city had high values for what residents were getting: single-family apartments crowded with multiple families, outstanding maintenance and, in many cases, no indoor plumbing.<ref name=\"mtholyoke.edu\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.mtholyoke.edu/courses/rschwart/clio/detroit_riot/DetroitNewsRiots1943.htm|title=The 1943 Detroit race riots|publisher=The Detroit News|author1=Vivian M. Baulch|author2=Patricia Zacharias|website=www.mtholyoke.edu}}</ref> The influx of African-Americans to Detroit exacerbated racial tensions already present in the city and culminated at the introduction of the [[Sojourner Truth]] Housing Project. \n\n==== Sojourner Truth Housing Project ====\nIn 1941, in an attempt to lessen the severity of the housing crisis, the federal government and the Detroit Housing Commission (DHS) approved the construction of the Sojourner Truth Housing Project with 200 units for black defense workers. The original location for this housing project was chosen by the DHC to be in the Seven Mile-Fenelon neighborhood in northeast Detroit. They believed that this location would be uncontroversial due to its proximity to an already existing African American neighborhood.<ref name=\"PUP\">{{cite book |last1=Sugrue |first1=Thomas J. |title=The Origins of the Urban Crisis |date=2005 |publisher=Princeton University Press |location=41 William Street, Princeton New Jersey 08540 |isbn=978-0-691-12186-4 |pages=73\u201375 |edition=First Princeton Classic}}</ref> However, this decision was met with immense backlash. \nWhite residents in the surrounding area formed an improvement association, the Seven Mile-Fenelon Improvement Association, and they were soon joined by the residents of the middle-class African American neighborhood, [[Conant Gardens]].<ref name=\"PUP\"/> These two groups formed an alliance and organized the resistance to the Sojourner Truth Project. These groups protested by meeting with city officials, sending thousands of angry letters to the government, and lobbying with their congressmen against the project, among other things.<ref name=\"PUP\"/> Since the [[Federal Housing Administration]] (FHA) refused to insure any mortgage loans in the area after the announcement of the project, many of the residents in the area believed that this project would decrease nearby property value and reduce their ability to build on nearby vacant lots.<ref name=\"PUP\"/> These beliefs were not unjustified due to the history of decreased property values in other integrated parts of the city. On the other side, civil rights groups and pro-public housing groups rallied for the federal government to keep its promise to allow black residents in Sojourner Truth housing and address the housing shortage. There was only one other housing project in the city for African Americans at this time.<ref name=\"PUP\"/>\n\nIn response to the uproar in the local community, the federal government changed its decision on the racial occupancy of the housing project multiple times. In January 1941, the DHC and federal officials declared that Sojourner Truth would have white occupants, but quickly decided instead that it would be occupied by black war workers just two weeks later. Ultimately, it was decided that the Sojourner Truth project would house black residents as originally promised, much to the frustration of the local white community.<ref name=\"p73-74\">{{cite book |last1=Sugrue |first1=Thomas |title=The Origins of the Urban Crisis |date=2014 |publisher=Princeton University Press |isbn=978-0-691-16255-3 |pages=73\u201374}}</ref>\n\nFebruary 1942 saw the culmination of these intense feelings about racial heterogeneity. As the first African-Americans workers and their families attempted to move into their new homes, large crowds of both black supporters and white opponents surrounded the area.<ref name=\"PUP\"/> A billboard announcing \"We Want White Tenants in our White Community\" with American flags attached was put up just before the families were to move in. White residents protested the project in the name of \"protecting\" their neighborhoods and property value.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.mtholyoke.edu/courses/rschwart/clio/detroit_riot/DetroitNewsRiots1943.htm|title=Rearview Mirror: The 1943 Detroit race riots|author1=Vivian M. Baulch|author2=Patricia Zacharias|date=2000}}</ref> These efforts continued throughout the day as more people attempted to move in and tensions continued to rise. More than a thousand people showed that up day and, eventually, fighting erupted between the supporters and opponents. Over a dozen police came onto the scene, but the situation worsened. The fighting resulted in over 40 injured and 220 arrested. Of those arrested, 109 were held for trial, only three of which were white.<ref name=\"PUP\"/> \n\nDetroit officials postponed the movement of African-Americans defense workers into the housing project in order to keep the peace.<ref name=\"mtholyoke.edu\"/>  This created a problem for the workers who did not have any place to live. The one other public housing that housed black was able to take up some of the residents, but many others had to find housing in other places. After about 2 months, protesting had reduced and Detroit Mayor [[Edward Jeffries]] called the Detroit police and Michigan National Guard to escort and protect the African-American workers and their families as they moved into their new homes. The riot led the DHC to establish a new policy mandating racial segregation in all future public housing projects and promised that future housing projects would not \u201cchange the racial patterns of a neighborhood.\u201d<ref name=\"PUP\"/> It also established the precedent that white community groups could utilize the threat of violence to their advantage in future housing debates.<ref name=\"PUP\"/>\n\n=== Assembly line tensions ===\nIn June 1943, [[Packard|Packard Motor Car Company]] finally promoted three blacks to work next to whites in the [[assembly line]]s, in keeping with the anti-segregation policy required for the defense industry. In response, 25,000 whites walked off the job in a \"hate\" or wildcat strike at Packard, effectively slowing down the critical [[Military production during World War II|war production]]. Although whites had long worked with blacks in the same plant, many wanted control of certain jobs, and did not want to work right next to blacks. Harold Zeck remembers seeing a group of white women workers coming into the assembly line to convince the white men workers to walk out of work to protest black women using the white woman\u2019s bathroom. Harold remembers one of the women saying \"They think their fannies are as good as ours.\" The protest ended when the men refused to leave work. There was a physical confrontation at Edgewood Park. In this period, racial riots also broke out in Los Angeles, [[Mobile, Alabama]] and [[Beaumont, Texas]], mostly over similar job issues at defense shipyard facilities.<ref name=\"capeci\"/>\n\n==Riot==\nAltercations between youths started on June 20, 1943, on a warm Sunday evening on [[Belle Isle Park|Belle Isle]], an island in the Detroit River off Detroit's mainland. In what is considered a communal disorder,<ref name=\"johnson\"/> youths fought intermittently through the afternoon. The brawl eventually grew into a confrontation between groups of whites and blacks on the long Belle Isle Bridge, crowded with more than 100,000 day trippers returning to the city from the park. From there the riot spread into the city. Sailors joined fights against blacks. The riot escalated in the city after a false rumor spread that a mob of whites had thrown an African-American mother and her baby into the Detroit River. Blacks looted and destroyed white property as retaliation. Whites overran Woodward to Veron where they proceeded to tip over 20 cars that belonged to black families. The whites also started to loot stores while rioting. \n\nHistorian Marilyn S. Johnson argues that this rumor reflected black male fears about historical white violence against black women and children.<ref name=\"johnson\">Marilynn S. Johnson, \"Gender, Race, and Rumours: Re-Examining the 1943 Race Riots,\" ''Gender and History'' (1998): 10:252-77.</ref><ref>Patricia A. Turner, (1994). [https://archive.org/details/ihearditthroughg0000turn/page/51 ''I Heard It Through the Grapevine: Rumor in African-American Culture''], p. 51.</ref>  An equally false rumor that blacks had raped and murdered a white woman on the Belle Isle Bridge swept through white neighborhoods. Angry mobs of whites spilled onto [[Woodward Avenue]] near the Roxy Theater around 4 a.m., beating blacks as they were getting off street cars on their way to work.<ref name=\"blogs.detroitnews.com\">[http://blogs.detroitnews.com/history/1999/02/10/the-1943-detroit-race-riots/ \"The 1943 Race Riots\"], ''Detroit News'', February 10, 1999</ref> They also went to the black neighborhood of Paradise Valley, one of the oldest and poorest neighborhoods in Detroit, attacking blacks who were trying to defend their homes. Blacks attacked white-owned businesses.\n\nThe clashes soon escalated to the point where mobs of whites and blacks were \u201cassaulting one another, beating innocent motorists, pedestrians and streetcar passengers, burning cars, destroying storefronts and looting businesses.\"<ref name=\"Sitkoff\" /> Both sides were said to have encouraged others to join in the riots with false claims that one of \"their own\" had been attacked unjustly.<ref name=\"Sitkoff\" /> Blacks were outnumbered by a large margin, and suffered many more deaths, personal injuries and property damage. Out of the 34 people killed, 24 of them were African American.<ref>{{cite web|last1=White|first1=Walter|title=What Caused the Detroit Riot?|url=https://archive.org/stream/whatcauseddetroi00whit/whatcauseddetroi00whit_djvu.txt|website=Archives|publisher=National Association for the Advancement of Colored People|accessdate=February 16, 2017}}</ref>\n\nThe riots lasted three days and ended only after Mayor Jeffries and Governor [[Harry Kelly (politician)|Harry Kelly]] asked [[Franklin D. Roosevelt|President Franklin Roosevelt]] to intervene. He ordered in federal troops; a total of 6,000 troops imposed a curfew, restored peace and occupied the streets of Detroit. Over the course of three days of rioting, 34 people had been killed; 25 were African Americans, of which 17 were killed by the police (their forces were predominantly white and dominated by ethnic whites). 13 deaths remain unsolved. Nine deaths reported were white, and out of the 1,800 arrests made, 85% of them were African American, and only 15% were white.<ref name=\"Sitkoff\" /> Of the approximately 600 persons injured, more than 75 percent were black people.\n\nThe first casualty was when a white civilian was struck by a taxi. Later after that, four young white males shot and killed a 58-year-old black civilian, Moses Kiska, who was sitting at the bus stop. Some Detroit police officers who were patrolling Paradise Valley told black civilians to run and not look back then proceeded to shoot some of them in the back. Later on, a white doctor ignored police warnings to avoid black neighborhoods. The doctor then went to a house call in a black neighborhood. He then was hit in the back of the head with a rock and beaten to death by black rioters. A couple years after this riot there was a monument dedicated to this doctor at the streets of East Grand and Gratiot. A black civilian was later coming off of a bus was then grabbed and beaten by a group of white assailants. This happened in front of four police officers that stood and watched. No one was arrested or cited.\n\n==Aftermath==\nAfter the riot, leaders on both sides had explanations for the violence, effectively blaming the other side. White city leaders, including the mayor, blamed young black hoodlums and persisted in framing the events as being caused by outsiders, people who were unemployed and marginal.<ref name=\"Sitkoff\" /> Mayor Jeffries said, \"Negro hoodlums started it, but the conduct of the police department, by and large, was magnificent.\"<ref>{{cite book|title=Working Detroit: The Making of a Union Town|first=Steve|last=Babson|page=119|publisher=Wayne State University Press|date=May 1, 1986}}</ref> The [[Wayne County, Michigan|Wayne County]] prosecutor believed that leaders of the [[NAACP]] were to blame as instigators of the riots.<ref name=\"Sitkoff\" /> Governor Kelly called together a Fact Finding Commission to investigate and report on the causes of the riot. Its mostly white members blamed black youths, \"unattached, uprooted, and unskilled misfits within an otherwise law-abiding black community,\" and regarded the events as an unfortunate incident. They made these judgments without interviewing any of the rioters, basing their conclusions on police reports, which were limited.<ref name=\"capeci\"/>\n\nOther officials drew similar conclusions, despite discovering and citing facts that disproved their thesis. Dr. Lowell S. Selling of the Recorder's Court Psychiatric Clinic conducted interviews with 100 black offenders. He found them to be \"employed, well-paid, longstanding (of at least 10 years) residents of the city\", with some education and a history of being law abiding. He attributed their violence to their Southern heritage. This view was repeated in a separate study by Elmer R. Akers and Vernon Fox, sociologist and psychologist, respectively, at the State Prison of Southern Michigan. Although most of the black men they studied had jobs and had been in Detroit an average of more than 10 years, Akers and Fox characterized them as unskilled and unsettled; they stressed the men's Southern heritage as predisposing them to violence.<ref name=\"capeci\"/>  Additionally, a commission was established to determine the cause of the riot, despite the obvious and unequal amount of violence toward blacks. Later, it was found that the commission was extremely biased; it blamed the riot on blacks and their community leaders.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Woodford|first=Arthur|year=2012|title=Detroit Riot of 1943|url=|journal=The Michigan Companion: A Guide to the Arts, Entertainment, Festivals, Food, Geography, Geology, Government, History, Holidays, Industry, Institutions, Media, People, Philanthropy, Religion, and Sports of the Great State of Michigan|volume=|pages=168\u2013169}}</ref>\n\nDetroit's black leaders identified numerous other substantive causes, including persistent racial discrimination in jobs and housing, frequent police brutality against blacks and the lack of black representation on the force, and the daily animosity directed at their people by much of Detroit's white population.<ref name=\"Sitkoff\" />\n\nFollowing the violence, Japanese propaganda officials incorporated the event into its materials that encouraged black soldiers not to fight for the United States.

He charged that police unfairly targeted blacks while turning their backs on white atrocities. He said 85 percent of those arrested were black while whites overturned and burned cars in front of the Roxy Theater with impunity as police watched. \"This weak-kneed policy of the police commissioner coupled with the anti-Negro attitude of many members of the force helped to make a riot inevitable.\"<ref name=\"blogs.detroitnews.com\"/>}}\n\n===Reinterpretation in 1990===\nA late 20th-century analysis of the facts collected on the arrested rioters has drawn markedly different conclusions. It notes that the whites who were arrested were younger, generally unemployed, and had traveled long distances from their homes to the black neighborhood to attack people there. Even in the early stage of the riots near [[MacArthur Bridge (Detroit)|Belle Isle Bridge]], white youths traveled in groups to the riot area and carried weapons.<ref name=\"capeci\"/>\n\nLater in the second stage, whites continued to act in groups and were prepared for action, carrying weapons and traveling miles to attack the black ghetto along its western side at [[M-1 (Michigan highway)|Woodward Avenue]]. Blacks who were arrested were older, often married and working men, who had lived in the city for 10 years or more. They fought closer to home, mainly acting independently to defend their homes, persons or neighborhood, and sometimes [[looting]] or destroying mostly white-owned property there in frustration. Where felonies occurred, whites were more often arrested for use of weapons, and blacks for looting or failing to observe the curfew imposed. Whites were more often arrested for misdemeanors. In broad terms, both sides acted to improve their positions; the whites fought out of fear, the blacks fought out of hope for better conditions.<ref name=\"capeci\"/>\n\n==Representation in other media==\n[[Ross Macdonald]], then writing under his real name, [[Ross Macdonald|Kenneth Millar]], used Detroit in the wake of this riot as one of the locales in his 1946 novel ''[[Trouble Follows Me]].''<ref>[https://goodreads.com/book/show/944440.Trouble_Follows_Me ''Trouble Follows Me'', on goodreads.com Retrieved November 18, 2015.]</ref>\n\nDominic J. Capeci Jr., Martha Wilkerson wrote a book about the Detroit Race Riot too. The book is called ''Layered Violence: The Detroit Rioters of 1943''. This book talks about the entire riot. It also talks about how blacks were considered hoodlums and the whites were known as hillbillies. This book also covers the blacks struggle for racial inequality in world war II. This also explains the rioters to be the transforming figures of racial violence in the twentieth century.\n\nElaine Latzman Moon also gives a brief overview about the riot in her book ''Untold Tales, Unsung Heroes : An Oral History of Detroit's African American Community, 1918-1967''.\n\n[[Loren D. Estleman]] alludes to the riots in his novel, [[A Smile on the Face of the Tiger]]. His detective [[Amos Walker]] is trying to find an old pulp writer who wrote a novel, Paradise Valley, about the riot. \n\nThere is also a copy of the newspaper from the riots listed on ebay. This paper was written by the San Francisco Chronicle with the headline ''Detroit Mob Violence''. This paper states that 23 people died, 20 black and 3 white. It also says that 700 people were injured.\n\n=== Comparison to 1967 riots ===\nFrom the perspective of the early 21st century, the 1943 riot has been seen as a precursor of riots of the late 1960s in several cities.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Kapell|first=Matthew Wilhelm|year=2009|title=Miscreants, be they white or colored|url=|journal=Michigan Academician|volume=39|pages=213|via=}}</ref>  The 1943 race riot was spurred by anti-black antipathy, as expressed by the proportion of whites who traveled to the primary black neighborhood to attack persons and property, by [[Police brutality in the United States|police brutality]] in the mostly white force, housing shortages due to racial discrimination, and fierce job competition in the late days of the [[Great Depression]]. The unequal numbers of blacks killed and wounded, blacks arrested, and property damage in the black neighborhood also expresses the social discrimination. Also expressive of this discrimination were the conclusions drawn by commissions, who ignored the evidence of the facts before them to repeat stereotypes about the rioters.\n\nThe [[1967 Detroit riot|1967 Detroit Riot]] was different in that both blacks and whites participated in destruction in the city. Violence was directed at attacking police and the [[National Guard of the United States|National Guard]], and destroying property.\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Michigan}}\n* [[1967 Detroit riot]]\n* [[Detroit race riot of 1863]]\n* [[Harlem riot of 1943]]\n* [[List of incidents of civil unrest in the United States]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==References==\n* Capeci, Dominic J., Jr., and Martha Wilkerson. \"The Detroit Rioters of 1943: A Reinterpretation,\" ''Michigan Historical Review,'' Jan 1990, Vol. 16 Issue 1, pp 49\u201372\n* Capeci, Dominic J., Jr., and Martha Wilkerson (1991).

It occurred in a period of dramatic population increase and social tensions associated with the military buildup of [[World War II]], as Detroit's automotive industry was converted to the [[war effort]]. Existing social tensions and housing shortages were exacerbated by the arrival of nearly 400,000 migrants, both [[African-American]] and [[White Southerners]], from the [[Southeastern United States]] between 1941 and 1943. The new migrants competed for space and jobs, as well as against European immigrants and their descendants.\n\nThe Detroit riot was one of three that summer; it followed one in [[Beaumont Race Riot of 1943|Beaumont, Texas]], earlier that month, in which white shipyard workers attacked blacks after a rumor that a white woman had been raped; another riot preceded in [[Harlem riot of 1943|Harlem, New York]], where blacks attacked white-owned property in their neighborhood after rumors that a black soldier had been killed by a white policeman. In this wartime period, there were also [[Zoot Suit Riots|racial riots in Los Angeles, California]], and [[Mobile, Alabama#20th century|Mobile, Alabama]], in which the former involved white military men attacking young Hispanic civilians in [[zoot suit]]s simply due to their clothing.\n\nThe rioting in Detroit began among youths at [[Belle Isle Park]] on June 20, 1943; the unrest moved into the city proper and was exacerbated by false rumors of racial attacks in both the black and white communities. It continued until June 22. It was suppressed after 6,000 federal troops were ordered into the city to restore peace. A total of 34 people were killed, 25 of them black and most at the hands of the white police force; 433 were wounded, 75 percent of them black; and property valued at $2 million ($27.5 million in 2015 US dollars) was destroyed. Most of the riot took place in the black area of [[Black Bottom, Detroit|Paradise Valley]], the poorest neighborhood of the city.<ref name=\"capeci\">[https://www.jstor.org/stable/20173210?seq=1#page_scan_tab_contents Dominic J. Capeci, Jr., and Martha Wilkerson, \"The Detroit Rioters of 1943: A Reinterpretation\"], ''Michigan Historical Review,'' Jan 1990, Vol. 16 Issue 1, pp. 49-72.</ref>\n\nAt the time, white commissions mistakenly attributed the cause of the riot to black people and youths. But the [[NAACP]] identified deeper causes: a shortage of affordable housing, discrimination in employment, lack of minority representation in the police, and white police brutality. A late 20th-century analysis of the rioters showed that the white rioters were younger and often unemployed (characteristics that the riot commissions had falsely attributed to blacks, despite evidence in front of them). If working, the whites often held semi-skilled or skilled positions. Whites traveled long distances across the city to join the first stage of the riot near the bridge to Belle Isle Park, and later some traveled in armed groups explicitly to attack the black neighborhood in Paradise Valley. The black participants were often older, established city residents, who in many cases had lived in the city for more than a decade. Many were married working men and were defending their homes and neighborhood against police and white rioters. They also looted and destroyed white-owned property in their neighborhood.<ref name=\"capeci\"/>\n\n==Events leading up to the riot==\n[[File:White sign racial hatred..jpg|{{largethumb}}|Sign posted in response to proposed Sojourner Truth Housing Project, February 1942]]\n\nBy 1920, Detroit had become the fourth-largest city in the United States, with an industrial and population boom driven by the rapid expansion of the automobile industry.<ref name=\"jackson127\">[https://books.google.com/books/about/The_Ku_Klux_Klan_in_the_City_1915_1930.html?id=0TUL_pAiQ4AC Kenneth Jackson, ''The Ku Klux Klan in the City, 1915-1930''], Rowman & Littlefield, 1967, pp.127-129</ref> In this era of continuing high immigration from southern and eastern Europe, the [[Ku Klux Klan]] in the 1920s established a substantial presence in Detroit during its early 20th-century revival.<ref name=\"pbs\">[https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/americanexperience/features/general-article/eleanor-riots/ General Article: \"Detroit Riots 1943\"], ''Eleanor Roosevelt'', ''American Experience'', PBS</ref> The KKK became concentrated in midwestern cities rather than exclusively in the South.<ref name=\"jackson127\"/> It was primarily anti-Catholic and anti-Jewish in this period, but it also supported [[white supremacy]].\n\nThe KKK contributed to Detroit's reputation for racial antagonism, and there were violent incidents dating from 1915.<ref name=\"capeci\"/> Its lesser-known offshoot, [[Black Legion (political movement)|Black Legion]], was also active in the Detroit area. In 1936 and 1937, some 48 members were convicted of numerous murders and attempted murder, thus ending Black Legion's run. Both organizations stood for white supremacy. Detroit was unique among northern cities by the 1940s for its exceptionally high percentage of Southern-born residents, both black and white.<ref>Gunnar Myrdal, ''An American Dilemma: The Negro Problem and American Democracy'', New York: 1941, p. 568</ref>\n\nSoon after the U.S. entry into [[World War II]], the automotive industry was converted to military production; high wages were offered, attracting large numbers of workers and their families from outside of Michigan. The new workers found little available housing, and competition among ethnic groups was fierce for both jobs and housing. With [[Executive Order 8802]], President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] on June 25, 1941, had prohibited [[racism|racial discrimination]] in the national [[Military-industrial complex|defense industry]]. Roosevelt called upon all groups to support the war effort. The Executive Order was applied irregularly, and blacks were often excluded from numerous industrial jobs, especially more skilled and supervisory positions. Due to the severe labor shortage during the war, Detroit companies began employing African Americans, but they were typically given the most grueling and dangerous jobs with low pay. For the first time, blacks and whites were in constant close proximity, resulting in hostile everyday interracial encounters. Whites accused blacks of forming a \u201cbump club\u201d in which members would purposely bump and shove white people in public places, on sidewalks and on the bus. \n\n=== Growing population ===\nIn 1941 at the beginning of the war, blacks numbered nearly 150,000 in Detroit, which had a total population of 1,623,452. Many of the blacks had migrated from the South in 1915 to 1930 during the [[Great Migration (African American)|Great Migration]], as the auto industry opened up many new jobs. By summer 1943, after the United States had entered [[World War II]], tensions between whites and blacks in Detroit were escalating; blacks resisted discrimination, as well as oppression and violence by the [[Detroit Police Department]]. The police force of the city was overwhelmingly white and the blacks resented this.\n\nIn the early 1940s, Detroit's population reached more than 2 million, absorbing more than 400,000 whites and some 50,000 black migrants, mostly from [[Southern United States|the American South]], where racial segregation was enforced by law.<ref name=\"capeci\"/> The more recent African Americans were part of the second wave of the black [[Great Migration (African American)|Great Migration]], joining 150,000 blacks already in the city. The early residents had been restricted by informal segregation and their limited finances to the poor and overcrowded East Side of the city. A 60-block area east of [[M-1 (Michigan highway)|Woodward Avenue]] was known as [[Black Bottom, Detroit|Paradise Valley]], and it had aging and substandard housing.\n\nWhite American migrants came largely from agricultural areas and especially rural Appalachia, carrying with them southern prejudices.<ref name=\"Sitkoff\">Sitkoff, \"The Detroit Race Riot 1943\"</ref> Rumors circulated among ethnic white groups to fear African Americans as competitors for housing and jobs. Blacks had continued to seek to escape the limited opportunities in the South, exacerbated by the [[Great Depression]] and second-class social status under [[Jim Crow laws]]. After arriving in Detroit, the new migrants found racial bigotry there, too. They had to compete for low-level jobs with numerous European immigrants or their descendants, in addition to rural southern whites. Blacks were excluded from all of the limited public housing except the [[Brewster-Douglass Housing Projects|Brewster Housing Projects]]. They were exploited by landlords and forced to pay rents that were two to three times higher than families paid in the less densely populated white districts. Like other poor migrants, they were generally limited to the oldest, substandard housing.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://apps.detnews.com/apps/history/index.php?id=185|title=The 1943 Detroit race riots|publisher=Detroit News|date=February 11, 1999|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120526204732/http://apps.detnews.com/apps/history/index.php?id=185|archivedate=May 26, 2012}}</ref>\n\n=== The Great Migration ===\nThe South changed very little after the [[American Civil War|Civil War]]. While slavery became illegal, the mentality of owning slaves in the South endured. The freedom of African Americans was more of an illusion than a reality, as they did not own land or have any source of income. As a result, many started working for the same people that enslaved them. Southern blacks migrated north in the 20th Century in hopes of leaving the oppressive culture in the South. Many considered Detroit to be the place of paradise, calling Detroit the \"New Canaan.\" During the Civil War, Detroit was an important stop on the [[Underground Railroad]], as many settled in the northern city or used it as a means to get to Canada. During World War II, it was sought out as a refuge for blacks seeking to escape the lingering effects of the Jim Crow era. The promise of employment and escape from the violent racial tensions in the South drew in many African American workers to the North. Before the war, black workers in Detroit were scarce: even in 1942, 119 of 197 Detroit manufacturers surveyed did not have any black employees. However, by 1943, Detroit's labor shortage had become so severe that companies finally began employing African Americans. A report in 1944 showed that with the 44% increase of wartime employment, black employment increased by 103%. [[Ford Motor Company]] was the leading manufacturer in black employment: half of all blacks in the auto industry in the U.S. were employed by Ford, and 12% of all Ford workers were black. Ford made sure to develop close ties with African Americans, being in contact with leading clergy at major black churches and using ministers as a screening process to obtain recommendations for the best potential workers. This ensured that Ford only employed reliable long-term workers who would be willing to do the most labor-intensive jobs. Around 1910, Ford gave a salary of $5 a day to its workers, which translates to over $120 today. Because of the city's growth in population and employment opportunities, Detroit became a symbol of cultural rebirth. The statement \u201cwhen I die, bury me in Detroit\u201d became popular among the black community for these reasons.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Sugrue |first1=Thomas |title=The Origins of the Urban Crisis |date=2014 |publisher=Princeton University Press |isbn=978-0-691-16255-3 |pages=25\u201327 |edition=First Princeton Classics}}</ref>\n\n=== World War II and Housing ===\nThe effect of World War II in Europe and Asia was felt heavily in the U.S. even before the [[attack on Pearl Harbor]]. The defense industry was growing rapidly because the country was immersed in a military buildup to provide assistance to their European and Asian allies.<ref name=\"britannica.com\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.britannica.com/event/Executive-Order-8802|title=Executive Order 8802 &#124; United States history|website=Encyclopedia Britannica}}</ref> On the [[home front]], African-Americans were subjected to low-level jobs with little security or protection against the discrimination and prejudice they faced in the work place. [[A. Philip Randolph]] and other civil rights leaders took this opportunity to speak with President Roosevelt about expanding opportunities for African-Americans by outlawing discrimination in the defense industry. At first, the president was hesitant to agree due to his political alignments but changed his mind when Randolph threatened a large march on the nation\u2019s capital.<ref name=\"britannica.com\"/> After President Roosevelt signed Executive Order 8802 which prohibited racial discrimination within the defense industry, he was then preoccupied with providing adequate housing for the new additions to the workforce. Housing in many cities was substandard, especially for people of color. Housing in Detroit was strained as both blacks and whites moved from southern states to Detroit to work in the booming manufacturing industry in the city. African-Americans were unable to buy houses in the suburbs during the majority of the 20th century due to racially biased practices, such as [[redlining]] and restrictive [[Covenant (law)|covenants]]. They had no choice but to live in substandard housing in downtown Detroit in an area more commonly known as Black Bottom. Properties in the city had high values for what residents were getting: single-family apartments crowded with multiple families, outstanding maintenance and, in many cases, no indoor plumbing.<ref name=\"mtholyoke.edu\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.mtholyoke.edu/courses/rschwart/clio/detroit_riot/DetroitNewsRiots1943.htm|title=The 1943 Detroit race riots|publisher=The Detroit News|author1=Vivian M. Baulch|author2=Patricia Zacharias|website=www.mtholyoke.edu}}</ref> The influx of African-Americans to Detroit exacerbated racial tensions already present in the city and culminated at the introduction of the [[Sojourner Truth]] Housing Project. \n\n==== Sojourner Truth Housing Project ====\nIn 1941, in an attempt to lessen the severity of the housing crisis, the federal government and the Detroit Housing Commission (DHS) approved the construction of the Sojourner Truth Housing Project with 200 units for black defense workers. The original location for this housing project was chosen by the DHC to be in the Seven Mile-Fenelon neighborhood in northeast Detroit. They believed that this location would be uncontroversial due to its proximity to an already existing African American neighborhood.<ref name=\"PUP\">{{cite book |last1=Sugrue |first1=Thomas J. |title=The Origins of the Urban Crisis |date=2005 |publisher=Princeton University Press |location=41 William Street, Princeton New Jersey 08540 |isbn=978-0-691-12186-4 |pages=73\u201375 |edition=First Princeton Classic}}</ref> However, this decision was met with immense backlash. \nWhite residents in the surrounding area formed an improvement association, the Seven Mile-Fenelon Improvement Association, and they were soon joined by the residents of the middle-class African American neighborhood, [[Conant Gardens]].<ref name=\"PUP\"/> These two groups formed an alliance and organized the resistance to the Sojourner Truth Project. These groups protested by meeting with city officials, sending thousands of angry letters to the government, and lobbying with their congressmen against the project, among other things.<ref name=\"PUP\"/> Since the [[Federal Housing Administration]] (FHA) refused to insure any mortgage loans in the area after the announcement of the project, many of the residents in the area believed that this project would decrease nearby property value and reduce their ability to build on nearby vacant lots.<ref name=\"PUP\"/> These beliefs were not unjustified due to the history of decreased property values in other integrated parts of the city. On the other side, civil rights groups and pro-public housing groups rallied for the federal government to keep its promise to allow black residents in Sojourner Truth housing and address the housing shortage. There was only one other housing project in the city for African Americans at this time.<ref name=\"PUP\"/>\n\nIn response to the uproar in the local community, the federal government changed its decision on the racial occupancy of the housing project multiple times. In January 1941, the DHC and federal officials declared that Sojourner Truth would have white occupants, but quickly decided instead that it would be occupied by black war workers just two weeks later. Ultimately, it was decided that the Sojourner Truth project would house black residents as originally promised, much to the frustration of the local white community.<ref name=\"p73-74\">{{cite book |last1=Sugrue |first1=Thomas |title=The Origins of the Urban Crisis |date=2014 |publisher=Princeton University Press |isbn=978-0-691-16255-3 |pages=73\u201374}}</ref>\n\nFebruary 1942 saw the culmination of these intense feelings about racial heterogeneity. As the first African-Americans workers and their families attempted to move into their new homes, large crowds of both black supporters and white opponents surrounded the area.<ref name=\"PUP\"/> A billboard announcing \"We Want White Tenants in our White Community\" with American flags attached was put up just before the families were to move in. White residents protested the project in the name of \"protecting\" their neighborhoods and property value.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.mtholyoke.edu/courses/rschwart/clio/detroit_riot/DetroitNewsRiots1943.htm|title=Rearview Mirror: The 1943 Detroit race riots|author1=Vivian M. Baulch|author2=Patricia Zacharias|date=2000}}</ref> These efforts continued throughout the day as more people attempted to move in and tensions continued to rise. More than a thousand people showed that up day and, eventually, fighting erupted between the supporters and opponents. Over a dozen police came onto the scene, but the situation worsened. The fighting resulted in over 40 injured and 220 arrested. Of those arrested, 109 were held for trial, only three of which were white.<ref name=\"PUP\"/> \n\nDetroit officials postponed the movement of African-Americans defense workers into the housing project in order to keep the peace.<ref name=\"mtholyoke.edu\"/>  This created a problem for the workers who did not have any place to live. The one other public housing that housed black was able to take up some of the residents, but many others had to find housing in other places. After about 2 months, protesting had reduced and Detroit Mayor [[Edward Jeffries]] called the Detroit police and Michigan National Guard to escort and protect the African-American workers and their families as they moved into their new homes. The riot led the DHC to establish a new policy mandating racial segregation in all future public housing projects and promised that future housing projects would not \u201cchange the racial patterns of a neighborhood.\u201d<ref name=\"PUP\"/> It also established the precedent that white community groups could utilize the threat of violence to their advantage in future housing debates.<ref name=\"PUP\"/>\n\n=== Assembly line tensions ===\nIn June 1943, [[Packard|Packard Motor Car Company]] finally promoted three blacks to work next to whites in the [[assembly line]]s, in keeping with the anti-segregation policy required for the defense industry. In response, 25,000 whites walked off the job in a \"hate\" or wildcat strike at Packard, effectively slowing down the critical [[Military production during World War II|war production]]. Although whites had long worked with blacks in the same plant, many wanted control of certain jobs, and did not want to work right next to blacks. Harold Zeck remembers seeing a group of white women workers coming into the assembly line to convince the white men workers to walk out of work to protest black women using the white woman\u2019s bathroom. Harold remembers one of the women saying \"They think their fannies are as good as ours.\" The protest ended when the men refused to leave work. There was a physical confrontation at Edgewood Park. In this period, racial riots also broke out in Los Angeles, [[Mobile, Alabama]] and [[Beaumont, Texas]], mostly over similar job issues at defense shipyard facilities.<ref name=\"capeci\"/>\n\n==Riot==\nAltercations between youths started on June 20, 1943, on a warm Sunday evening on [[Belle Isle Park|Belle Isle]], an island in the Detroit River off Detroit's mainland. In what is considered a communal disorder,<ref name=\"johnson\"/> youths fought intermittently through the afternoon. The brawl eventually grew into a confrontation between groups of whites and blacks on the long Belle Isle Bridge, crowded with more than 100,000 day trippers returning to the city from the park. From there the riot spread into the city. Sailors joined fights against blacks. The riot escalated in the city after a false rumor spread that a mob of whites had thrown an African-American mother and her baby into the Detroit River. Blacks looted and destroyed white property as retaliation. Whites overran Woodward to Veron where they proceeded to tip over 20 cars that belonged to black families. The whites also started to loot stores while rioting. \n\nHistorian Marilyn S. Johnson argues that this rumor reflected black male fears about historical white violence against black women and children.<ref name=\"johnson\">Marilynn S. Johnson, \"Gender, Race, and Rumours: Re-Examining the 1943 Race Riots,\" ''Gender and History'' (1998): 10:252-77.</ref><ref>Patricia A. Turner, (1994). [https://archive.org/details/ihearditthroughg0000turn/page/51 ''I Heard It Through the Grapevine: Rumor in African-American Culture''], p. 51.</ref>  An equally false rumor that blacks had raped and murdered a white woman on the Belle Isle Bridge swept through white neighborhoods. Angry mobs of whites spilled onto [[Woodward Avenue]] near the Roxy Theater around 4 a.m., beating blacks as they were getting off street cars on their way to work.<ref name=\"blogs.detroitnews.com\">[http://blogs.detroitnews.com/history/1999/02/10/the-1943-detroit-race-riots/ \"The 1943 Race Riots\"], ''Detroit News'', February 10, 1999</ref> They also went to the black neighborhood of Paradise Valley, one of the oldest and poorest neighborhoods in Detroit, attacking blacks who were trying to defend their homes. Blacks attacked white-owned businesses.\n\nThe clashes soon escalated to the point where mobs of whites and blacks were \u201cassaulting one another, beating innocent motorists, pedestrians and streetcar passengers, burning cars, destroying storefronts and looting businesses.\"<ref name=\"Sitkoff\" /> Both sides were said to have encouraged others to join in the riots with false claims that one of \"their own\" had been attacked unjustly.<ref name=\"Sitkoff\" /> Blacks were outnumbered by a large margin, and suffered many more deaths, personal injuries and property damage. Out of the 34 people killed, 24 of them were African American.<ref>{{cite web|last1=White|first1=Walter|title=What Caused the Detroit Riot?|url=https://archive.org/stream/whatcauseddetroi00whit/whatcauseddetroi00whit_djvu.txt|website=Archives|publisher=National Association for the Advancement of Colored People|accessdate=February 16, 2017}}</ref>\n\nThe riots lasted three days and ended only after Mayor Jeffries and Governor [[Harry Kelly (politician)|Harry Kelly]] asked [[Franklin D. Roosevelt|President Franklin Roosevelt]] to intervene. He ordered in federal troops; a total of 6,000 troops imposed a curfew, restored peace and occupied the streets of Detroit. Over the course of three days of rioting, 34 people had been killed; 25 were African Americans, of which 17 were killed by the police (their forces were predominantly white and dominated by ethnic whites). 13 deaths remain unsolved. Nine deaths reported were white, and out of the 1,800 arrests made, 85% of them were African American, and only 15% were white.<ref name=\"Sitkoff\" /> Of the approximately 600 persons injured, more than 75 percent were black people.\n\nThe first casualty was when a white civilian was struck by a taxi. Later after that, four young white males shot and killed a 58-year-old black civilian, Moses Kiska, who was sitting at the bus stop. Some Detroit police officers who were patrolling Paradise Valley told black civilians to run and not look back then proceeded to shoot some of them in the back. Later on, a white doctor ignored police warnings to avoid black neighborhoods. The doctor then went to a house call in a black neighborhood. He then was hit in the back of the head with a rock and beaten to death by black rioters. A couple years after this riot there was a monument dedicated to this doctor at the streets of East Grand and Gratiot. A black civilian was later coming off of a bus was then grabbed and beaten by a group of white assailants. This happened in front of four police officers that stood and watched. No one was arrested or cited.\n\n==Aftermath==\nAfter the riot, leaders on both sides had explanations for the violence, effectively blaming the other side. White city leaders, including the mayor, blamed young black hoodlums and persisted in framing the events as being caused by outsiders, people who were unemployed and marginal.<ref name=\"Sitkoff\" /> Mayor Jeffries said, \"Negro hoodlums started it, but the conduct of the police department, by and large, was magnificent.\"<ref>{{cite book|title=Working Detroit: The Making of a Union Town|first=Steve|last=Babson|page=119|publisher=Wayne State University Press|date=May 1, 1986}}</ref> The [[Wayne County, Michigan|Wayne County]] prosecutor believed that leaders of the [[NAACP]] were to blame as instigators of the riots.<ref name=\"Sitkoff\" /> Governor Kelly called together a Fact Finding Commission to investigate and report on the causes of the riot. Its mostly white members blamed black youths, \"unattached, uprooted, and unskilled misfits within an otherwise law-abiding black community,\" and regarded the events as an unfortunate incident. They made these judgments without interviewing any of the rioters, basing their conclusions on police reports, which were limited.<ref name=\"capeci\"/>\n\nOther officials drew similar conclusions, despite discovering and citing facts that disproved their thesis. Dr. Lowell S. Selling of the Recorder's Court Psychiatric Clinic conducted interviews with 100 black offenders. He found them to be \"employed, well-paid, longstanding (of at least 10 years) residents of the city\", with some education and a history of being law abiding. He attributed their violence to their Southern heritage. This view was repeated in a separate study by Elmer R. Akers and Vernon Fox, sociologist and psychologist, respectively, at the State Prison of Southern Michigan. Although most of the black men they studied had jobs and had been in Detroit an average of more than 10 years, Akers and Fox characterized them as unskilled and unsettled; they stressed the men's Southern heritage as predisposing them to violence.<ref name=\"capeci\"/>  Additionally, a commission was established to determine the cause of the riot, despite the obvious and unequal amount of violence toward blacks. Later, it was found that the commission was extremely biased; it blamed the riot on blacks and their community leaders.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Woodford|first=Arthur|year=2012|title=Detroit Riot of 1943|url=|journal=The Michigan Companion: A Guide to the Arts, Entertainment, Festivals, Food, Geography, Geology, Government, History, Holidays, Industry, Institutions, Media, People, Philanthropy, Religion, and Sports of the Great State of Michigan|volume=|pages=168\u2013169}}</ref>\n\nDetroit's black leaders identified numerous other substantive causes, including persistent racial discrimination in jobs and housing, frequent police brutality against blacks and the lack of black representation on the force, and the daily animosity directed at their people by much of Detroit's white population.<ref name=\"Sitkoff\" />\n\nFollowing the violence, Japanese propaganda officials incorporated the event into its materials that encouraged black soldiers not to fight for the United States. They distributed a flyer titled \"Fight Between Two Races\".<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.pinterest.com/pin/252272016599338594/|title=Japanese Pamphlet -- \"A Fight Between Two Races\" |website=Pinterest}}</ref> The Axis Powers publicized the riot as a sign of Western decline. [[Racial segregation in the United States Armed Forces]] was ongoing, and the response to the riots hurt morale in African-American units \u2013 most significantly the 1511th Quartermaster Truck regiment, which mutinied against white officers and military police on June 24 in the [[Battle of Bamber Bridge]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.lep.co.uk/lifestyle/nostalgia/when-the-american-military-said-sorry-to-bamber-bridge-1-4440360|title=When the American military said sorry to Bamber Bridge|date=12 April 2012|accessdate=2 June 2017|newspaper=[[Lancashire Evening Post]]}}</ref><ref name=\"BBC\">{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/history/ww2peopleswar/stories/85/a3677385.shtml |first1=Harold |last1=Pollins |title=WW2 People's War \u2013 The Battle of Bamber Bridge |publisher=[[BBC]] |date= |accessdate=4 April 2017}}</ref>\n\n[[Walter Francis White|Walter White]], head of the [[NAACP]], noted that there was no rioting at the Packard and Hudson plants, where leaders of the [[UAW]] and [[Congress of Industrial Organizations|CIO]] had been incorporating blacks as part of the rank and file.

Paul Finkelman, Oxford University Press, USA, 2009, pp. 59-60</ref>\n\nAccording to ''[[The Detroit News]]'':\n{{Quote|Future Supreme Court Justice, [[Thurgood Marshall]], then with the NAACP, assailed the city's handling of the riot. He charged that police unfairly targeted blacks while turning their backs on white atrocities. He said 85 percent of those arrested were black while whites overturned and burned cars in front of the Roxy Theater with impunity as police watched. \"This weak-kneed policy of the police commissioner coupled with the anti-Negro attitude of many members of the force helped to make a riot inevitable.\"<ref name=\"blogs.detroitnews.com\"/>}}\n\n===Reinterpretation in 1990===\nA late 20th-century analysis of the facts collected on the arrested rioters has drawn markedly different conclusions. It notes that the whites who were arrested were younger, generally unemployed, and had traveled long distances from their homes to the black neighborhood to attack people there. Even in the early stage of the riots near [[MacArthur Bridge (Detroit)|Belle Isle Bridge]], white youths traveled in groups to the riot area and carried weapons.<ref name=\"capeci\"/>\n\nLater in the second stage, whites continued to act in groups and were prepared for action, carrying weapons and traveling miles to attack the black ghetto along its western side at [[M-1 (Michigan highway)|Woodward Avenue]]. Blacks who were arrested were older, often married and working men, who had lived in the city for 10 years or more. They fought closer to home, mainly acting independently to defend their homes, persons or neighborhood, and sometimes [[looting]] or destroying mostly white-owned property there in frustration. Where felonies occurred, whites were more often arrested for use of weapons, and blacks for looting or failing to observe the curfew imposed. Whites were more often arrested for misdemeanors. In broad terms, both sides acted to improve their positions; the whites fought out of fear, the blacks fought out of hope for better conditions.<ref name=\"capeci\"/>\n\n==Representation in other media==\n[[Ross Macdonald]], then writing under his real name, [[Ross Macdonald|Kenneth Millar]], used Detroit in the wake of this riot as one of the locales in his 1946 novel ''[[Trouble Follows Me]].''<ref>[https://goodreads.com/book/show/944440.Trouble_Follows_Me ''Trouble Follows Me'', on goodreads.com Retrieved November 18, 2015.]</ref>\n\nDominic J. Capeci Jr., Martha Wilkerson wrote a book about the Detroit Race Riot too. The book is called ''Layered Violence: The Detroit Rioters of 1943''. This book talks about the entire riot. It also talks about how blacks were considered hoodlums and the whites were known as hillbillies. This book also covers the blacks struggle for racial inequality in world war II. This also explains the rioters to be the transforming figures of racial violence in the twentieth century.\n\nElaine Latzman Moon also gives a brief overview about the riot in her book ''Untold Tales, Unsung Heroes : An Oral History of Detroit's African American Community, 1918-1967''.\n\n[[Loren D. Estleman]] alludes to the riots in his novel, [[A Smile on the Face of the Tiger]]. His detective [[Amos Walker]] is trying to find an old pulp writer who wrote a novel, Paradise Valley, about the riot. \n\nThere is also a copy of the newspaper from the riots listed on ebay. This paper was written by the San Francisco Chronicle with the headline ''Detroit Mob Violence''. This paper states that 23 people died, 20 black and 3 white. It also says that 700 people were injured.\n\n=== Comparison to 1967 riots ===\nFrom the perspective of the early 21st century, the 1943 riot has been seen as a precursor of riots of the late 1960s in several cities.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Kapell|first=Matthew Wilhelm|year=2009|title=Miscreants, be they white or colored|url=|journal=Michigan Academician|volume=39|pages=213|via=}}</ref>  The 1943 race riot was spurred by anti-black antipathy, as expressed by the proportion of whites who traveled to the primary black neighborhood to attack persons and property, by [[Police brutality in the United States|police brutality]] in the mostly white force, housing shortages due to racial discrimination, and fierce job competition in the late days of the [[Great Depression]]. The unequal numbers of blacks killed and wounded, blacks arrested, and property damage in the black neighborhood also expresses the social discrimination. Also expressive of this discrimination were the conclusions drawn by commissions, who ignored the evidence of the facts before them to repeat stereotypes about the rioters.\n\nThe [[1967 Detroit riot|1967 Detroit Riot]] was different in that both blacks and whites participated in destruction in the city. Violence was directed at attacking police and the [[National Guard of the United States|National Guard]], and destroying property.\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Michigan}}\n* [[1967 Detroit riot]]\n* [[Detroit race riot of 1863]]\n* [[Harlem riot of 1943]]\n* [[List of incidents of civil unrest in the United States]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==References==\n* Capeci, Dominic J., Jr., and Martha Wilkerson. \"The Detroit Rioters of 1943: A Reinterpretation,\" ''Michigan Historical Review,'' Jan 1990, Vol. 16 Issue 1, pp 49\u201372\n* Capeci, Dominic J., Jr., and Martha Wilkerson (1991).

It was also the first car mass-produced car.It followed the 10HP \u201dType A \u201c (June 1919) which was replaced by the 10HP \u201cB2\u201d (June 1921) ; they were the first European mass-produced cars.\n\nThe first colour in which it was made was yellow,(a pale \u201c grapefruit \u201c yellow) which earned it the first nickname \u201c petite citron \"(little lemon). It was also nicknamed \"Cul de poule \" (hen's bottom) , \"boat tail\u201d or \u201cboat deck Citro\u00ebn\" referring to the tapered rear of the little car's body and also \u201cTrefle \u201c ( clover leaf ) referring to the shape of the three-seat version.\n\n== History ==\nSources<ref name=\"ch\">{{cite web|title=Citro\u00ebn 5HP par Bernard Laurent|url=http://www.citroen-5hp-10hp.com/pages/citroundefinedn-5hp-1922-1926.html|website=citroen-5hp.com|language=fr}}</ref>\n\nWhile the French government encouraged, by means of tax benefits, car manufacturers to invest in cyclecars, Andr\u00e9 Citro\u00ebn preferred to turn to small cars. The 5HP was the first Citro\u00ebn to enter the small car sector, then monopolized by Peugeot and Renault.\n\nDespite its resemblance to the Type A designed by Jules Salomon, the 5HP was in fact the work of engineer Edmond Moyet who a few months earlier had made a very similar vehicle for Amilcar, the\u201d CC\u201d .\n\nThe genius of Andr\u00e9 Citro\u00ebn was to promote this car to a female audience, which was very unusual at the time. All the 5HP advertising documents represented the car driven by a young woman.\n\nWith the 5HP, Citro\u00ebn allied itself to mass motoring. This is emphasised by the fact that the 5HP could also be bought on credit, a new method for the time, thanks to a consumer credit company, founded by Andr\u00e9 Citro\u00ebn.\n\nAfter a slow start in 1922, the success was such, that, from 1924, it accounted for nearly half of Citroen\u2019s sales and became the first European popular automobile .The selling price of the 5HP \u201cTorpedo\u201d in 1922 (8,500 FR) was about 60% of that of the 10 HP (13,900 FR).\n\nThe initial commercial name: 5HP became 5CV in 1925 on the occasion of the change of calculation of the power of engines:  from HP ( Horse Power ) to CV ( Cheval Vapeur) ).\n\nA network of 5000 agents was built up between 1919 and 1925. Exclusive subsidiaries and dealers were located all over the world: Great Britain, Italy, Japan, Spain, Belgium, North Africa, Australia South America etc.\nFactories were built in Spain, Italy, Poland, Algeria, Belgium, and England from 1925 in order to avoid customs taxes on imported products (such as: Mac Kenna taxes in England) \n \nLaunched in May 1922, the \"Torpedo\" ( tourer) , was a two-seat version, which in 1923, became available in a more luxurious \u201c Cabriolet \u201c (convertible) version. \nIn 1924, a three-seater version of the \u201c Torpedo \u201c  initially with a  \"folding seat\"  , then with two seats at the front and one at the rear, was introduced which got the nickname \"Cloverleaf \".\n[[File:Bubsy.jpg - Citroen Type C 5 HP Torpedo.jpg|thumb|\"Bubsy\" back to Perth on 30/12/1925 after 17000 Km in 5 months.]]\nThe 5HP was a model of reliability and frugality compared to the competition; it was extremely robust evidenced by the journey of 17000 Km in 5 months around Australia in 1925 of Bubsy, a \"used\" Torpedo with two students on board: in extreme conditions ... without any engine problem .<ref>{{cite web|title=First Car Around Australia|url=http://www.classicrally.com.au/First%20Car%20Around%20Australia%20Feature.htm|website=www.classicrally.com.au|access-date=2018-12-04}}</ref>\n\nUnfortunately, although the 5HP was a success, it was insufficiently profitable, and in order to prepare for the introduction of the \"all steel\" B14, Andr\u00e9 Citro\u00ebn personally took the decision, against general opinion, to end its production in May 1926.\nA C4 \u201call steel\u201c version was envisaged but was abandoned because of excessive cost.\n\nToday, the 5HP is the typical 20s vintage car. Its success is due to the fact that it was already an immense commercial success in its time and also that it is possible to rebuild it very easily from period parts and re-fabrications.\n\nOf the 83000 5HP built, many have been converted into utility vehicles, tractors etc. It is estimated that about 3000 (4%) survived.\n\n== Technical ==\nSource<ref name=\"ch\"/>\n<ref>{{cite web|title=Chassis of Citro\u00ebn 7.5hp|url=http://www.citroen-5hp.ch/en/mod/chassistypes.htm#Chassis%20Type%20C2|website=www.citroen-5hp.ch|access-date=2018-12-04}}</ref>\n \n[[Image:Citroen_tr\u00e8fle_tableau_de_bord.JPG|right|thumb|Controls on Torpedo Trefle ...]]\n[[File:5HP TL Tableau Bord.jpg|thumb|... and on Cabriolet C3]]\n\nThe little Citro\u00ebn was ahead of the competition: it was equipped with a differential and an electric starter, allowing the car to be advertised as especially suitable for lady drivers sensitive to ease of driving.\nThe weight of 543&nbsp;kg is essentially that of the engine  ,  gearbox, and rear axle . The maximum speed was 60&nbsp;km/h (37&nbsp;mph) with a fuel consumption of 5 l/100&nbsp;km (56 mpg imp; 47 mpg US).\n \nThe 5HP chassis were assembled in the Levallois factory , (  Paris suburbs ), and the assembly of the car was in the Javel factory ; \nRight hand drive versions were available for the French market ( there was still a demand for this) and for export ( England, Commonwealth, Sweden, Argentina, Australia )\n \nThe body was of a wooden structure, on which the body panels were nailed. It was the last Citroen with a wooden body. The car had only one door, on the passenger side, it opened forwards. \nThe hinges were invisible (except for the \u201cCabriolet\u201d ) and the vibrations were absorbed by a double cone lock avoiding accidental opening of the doors.\n \nPre-production vehicles had a bonnet with 3 airvents that was quickly followed by a 16 airvents version. \nIt had one of the most handsome radiator masks. In 1922, for technical reasons, the radiator was separated into a cooling element and a nickel-plated outer casing. Initially the first Citro\u00ebn badge on the radiator was blue chevrons on a nickel-plated base ; later the colours were swapped.\n\nThe four-cylinder, 856 cc (52.2 cu in) engine had a bore of 55&nbsp;mm (2.2&nbsp;in) and stroke of 90&nbsp;mm (3.5&nbsp;in), generating an output of 8.2&nbsp;kW (11&nbsp;bhp) and was cooled by thermosiphon. From June 1, 1925, the cooling system was improved on all models by a fan ( previously fitted only to the Cabriolet ).\n\nThere was a single Solex carburettor ( Zenith on VL model )\nThe ignition initially by battery, coil and distributor was replaced around March 1923 by a magneto ignition.\n\nThe gearbox had three unsynchronized ratios plus a reverse gear ; the straight sized sprocket tended to \"sing\" especially in 1st and 2nd gear ( not in 3rd, direct drive ) and became noisy when the gears were worn or when the bush between primary and secondary shaft was loose.  This excessive play caused the primary train to become mis-aligned from the secondary train, causing the sprockets to operate on the end of the teeth, hence additional noise and premature wear.\n\nAs on contemporary cars of the time, the accelerator pedal was located centrally between those of the clutch and the brake.\n\nThere was no braking on the front wheels but braking on the transmission was controlled by the foot brake and on the rear wheels by a hand brake lever. Braking was not the strong point of the car; it was necessary to anticipate and balance the action of the two braking systems at the risk of breaking a rear wheel shaft. Many 5HP have been modified to couple the transmission brake and the rear brakes and this modification was finally offered in series on the last 1926 models.\n[[File:Moteur 5HP 1924.jpg|thumb| 5HP engine 1924 ]]\n[[File:Moteur Citroen 5HP.jpg|thumb|Engine  with RB magneto]]\nTo avoid distortion of the U shaped side members, the ladder frame was trapezoidal and reinforced by cross beams .\n\nThe suspension consisted of four inverted quarter-elliptical leaf springs. Friction dampers became fitted, at the rear from 1925 on the \nheavier \u201cCabriolet\u201d.\n\nAt the end of 1923, the short chassis Type C.2 was lengthened by 10&nbsp;cm from 2.25 m (7&nbsp;ft 5 in) to 2.35m (7&nbsp;ft 9 in) and re-inforced by an additional crossbar which protruded from the rear deck and supported the rear of the body. This became the long wheelbase chassis Type C.3. The extension of the bodywork had become necessary to allow the construction of the new \"three seat\" version of the \u201cTorpedo\u201d as well as the \u201c Voiture de Livraison \u201c ( delivery car ). The lengthening can be noted by the longer distance between the spare wheel and the rear wing. This chassis was produced without modification until the end of production.\n\nThe rear axle was of the \"banjo\" type with a round or oblong (oval) shape. The teeth of the rear axle pinion were of the \"Citro\u00ebn chevron\" type. An helical cut, easier to produce and more robust became available, as replacement parts,  in 1928 .\n\nInitially, the 700x80 beaded edge Michelin \"Cabl\u00e9\" tyres were inflated at \"high pressure\", ( 4 to 5 bars) , hence a mediocre roadholding and comfort. They were replaced in June 1924 by 715x115 beaded edge Michelin \"Cabl\u00e9 Confort\" (balloon ) tyres inflated at low pressure (2.5 bars), initially offered as extra equipment and then fitted on all cars in June . 11-12x45 wired on rims appeared in 1927 with \u00ab Confort Bibendum \u00ab  tyres, low pressure (1.5 to 1.75 bars). and were fitted as replacement of original beaded edge rims .\n\n\nThe equipment level of the 5 HP being relatively basic, many component suppliers took the opportunity to offer multiple solutions to improve driving comfort or performance such as: luggage rack, petrol gauge (OS), water thermometer (Boyer-Meter), speedometer and watch (Jaeger, OS), shock absorbers (Houdaille, Repusseau), front brakes ( Poulet , Acmos), engine improvements (Super-Culasse Desprez, Transformations F. Crespelle,  Ruby-Ricardo cylinder head).\n\n== Models ==\nSource<ref>{{cite book |last1=Laurent |first1=Bernard |title=Citroen 5HP |publisher= |page=Chassis Models 29 to 47}}</ref>\n\nIn 1922-23, the \" Torpedo \" ( tourer) T2 , and the \"Cabriolet\" ( convertible ) TL, were two-seat versions on the short wheelbase chassis (C2).

It was also the first car mass-produced car.It followed the 10HP \u201dType A \u201c (June 1919) which was replaced by the 10HP \u201cB2\u201d (June 1921) ; they were the first European mass-produced cars.\n\nThe first colour in which it was made was yellow,(a pale \u201c grapefruit \u201c yellow) which earned it the first nickname \u201c petite citron \"(little lemon). It was also nicknamed \"Cul de poule \" (hen's bottom) , \"boat tail\u201d or \u201cboat deck Citro\u00ebn\" referring to the tapered rear of the little car's body and also \u201cTrefle \u201c ( clover leaf ) referring to the shape of the three-seat version.\n\n== History ==\nSources<ref name=\"ch\">{{cite web|title=Citro\u00ebn 5HP par Bernard Laurent|url=http://www.citroen-5hp-10hp.com/pages/citroundefinedn-5hp-1922-1926.html|website=citroen-5hp.com|language=fr}}</ref>\n\nWhile the French government encouraged, by means of tax benefits, car manufacturers to invest in cyclecars, Andr\u00e9 Citro\u00ebn preferred to turn to small cars. The 5HP was the first Citro\u00ebn to enter the small car sector, then monopolized by Peugeot and Renault.\n\nDespite its resemblance to the Type A designed by Jules Salomon, the 5HP was in fact the work of engineer Edmond Moyet who a few months earlier had made a very similar vehicle for Amilcar, the\u201d CC\u201d .\n\nThe genius of Andr\u00e9 Citro\u00ebn was to promote this car to a female audience, which was very unusual at the time. All the 5HP advertising documents represented the car driven by a young woman.\n\nWith the 5HP, Citro\u00ebn allied itself to mass motoring. This is emphasised by the fact that the 5HP could also be bought on credit, a new method for the time, thanks to a consumer credit company, founded by Andr\u00e9 Citro\u00ebn.\n\nAfter a slow start in 1922, the success was such, that, from 1924, it accounted for nearly half of Citroen\u2019s sales and became the first European popular automobile .The selling price of the 5HP \u201cTorpedo\u201d in 1922 (8,500 FR) was about 60% of that of the 10 HP (13,900 FR).\n\nThe initial commercial name: 5HP became 5CV in 1925 on the occasion of the change of calculation of the power of engines:  from HP ( Horse Power ) to CV ( Cheval Vapeur) ).\n\nA network of 5000 agents was built up between 1919 and 1925. Exclusive subsidiaries and dealers were located all over the world: Great Britain, Italy, Japan, Spain, Belgium, North Africa, Australia South America etc.\nFactories were built in Spain, Italy, Poland, Algeria, Belgium, and England from 1925 in order to avoid customs taxes on imported products (such as: Mac Kenna taxes in England) \n \nLaunched in May 1922, the \"Torpedo\" ( tourer) , was a two-seat version, which in 1923, became available in a more luxurious \u201c Cabriolet \u201c (convertible) version. \nIn 1924, a three-seater version of the \u201c Torpedo \u201c  initially with a  \"folding seat\"  , then with two seats at the front and one at the rear, was introduced which got the nickname \"Cloverleaf \".\n[[File:Bubsy.jpg - Citroen Type C 5 HP Torpedo.jpg|thumb|\"Bubsy\" back to Perth on 30/12/1925 after 17000 Km in 5 months.]]\nThe 5HP was a model of reliability and frugality compared to the competition; it was extremely robust evidenced by the journey of 17000 Km in 5 months around Australia in 1925 of Bubsy, a \"used\" Torpedo with two students on board: in extreme conditions ... without any engine problem .<ref>{{cite web|title=First Car Around Australia|url=http://www.classicrally.com.au/First%20Car%20Around%20Australia%20Feature.htm|website=www.classicrally.com.au|access-date=2018-12-04}}</ref>\n\nUnfortunately, although the 5HP was a success, it was insufficiently profitable, and in order to prepare for the introduction of the \"all steel\" B14, Andr\u00e9 Citro\u00ebn personally took the decision, against general opinion, to end its production in May 1926.\nA C4 \u201call steel\u201c version was envisaged but was abandoned because of excessive cost.\n\nToday, the 5HP is the typical 20s vintage car. Its success is due to the fact that it was already an immense commercial success in its time and also that it is possible to rebuild it very easily from period parts and re-fabrications.\n\nOf the 83000 5HP built, many have been converted into utility vehicles, tractors etc. It is estimated that about 3000 (4%) survived.\n\n== Technical ==\nSource<ref name=\"ch\"/>\n<ref>{{cite web|title=Chassis of Citro\u00ebn 7.5hp|url=http://www.citroen-5hp.ch/en/mod/chassistypes.htm#Chassis%20Type%20C2|website=www.citroen-5hp.ch|access-date=2018-12-04}}</ref>\n \n[[Image:Citroen_tr\u00e8fle_tableau_de_bord.JPG|right|thumb|Controls on Torpedo Trefle ...]]\n[[File:5HP TL Tableau Bord.jpg|thumb|... and on Cabriolet C3]]\n\nThe little Citro\u00ebn was ahead of the competition: it was equipped with a differential and an electric starter, allowing the car to be advertised as especially suitable for lady drivers sensitive to ease of driving.\nThe weight of 543&nbsp;kg is essentially that of the engine  ,  gearbox, and rear axle . The maximum speed was 60&nbsp;km/h (37&nbsp;mph) with a fuel consumption of 5 l/100&nbsp;km (56 mpg imp; 47 mpg US).\n \nThe 5HP chassis were assembled in the Levallois factory , (  Paris suburbs ), and the assembly of the car was in the Javel factory ; \nRight hand drive versions were available for the French market ( there was still a demand for this) and for export ( England, Commonwealth, Sweden, Argentina, Australia )\n \nThe body was of a wooden structure, on which the body panels were nailed. It was the last Citroen with a wooden body. The car had only one door, on the passenger side, it opened forwards. \nThe hinges were invisible (except for the \u201cCabriolet\u201d ) and the vibrations were absorbed by a double cone lock avoiding accidental opening of the doors.\n \nPre-production vehicles had a bonnet with 3 airvents that was quickly followed by a 16 airvents version. \nIt had one of the most handsome radiator masks. In 1922, for technical reasons, the radiator was separated into a cooling element and a nickel-plated outer casing. Initially the first Citro\u00ebn badge on the radiator was blue chevrons on a nickel-plated base ; later the colours were swapped.\n\nThe four-cylinder, 856 cc (52.2 cu in) engine had a bore of 55&nbsp;mm (2.2&nbsp;in) and stroke of 90&nbsp;mm (3.5&nbsp;in), generating an output of 8.2&nbsp;kW (11&nbsp;bhp) and was cooled by thermosiphon. From June 1, 1925, the cooling system was improved on all models by a fan ( previously fitted only to the Cabriolet ).\n\nThere was a single Solex carburettor ( Zenith on VL model )\nThe ignition initially by battery, coil and distributor was replaced around March 1923 by a magneto ignition.\n\nThe gearbox had three unsynchronized ratios plus a reverse gear ; the straight sized sprocket tended to \"sing\" especially in 1st and 2nd gear ( not in 3rd, direct drive ) and became noisy when the gears were worn or when the bush between primary and secondary shaft was loose.  This excessive play caused the primary train to become mis-aligned from the secondary train, causing the sprockets to operate on the end of the teeth, hence additional noise and premature wear.\n\nAs on contemporary cars of the time, the accelerator pedal was located centrally between those of the clutch and the brake.\n\nThere was no braking on the front wheels but braking on the transmission was controlled by the foot brake and on the rear wheels by a hand brake lever. Braking was not the strong point of the car; it was necessary to anticipate and balance the action of the two braking systems at the risk of breaking a rear wheel shaft. Many 5HP have been modified to couple the transmission brake and the rear brakes and this modification was finally offered in series on the last 1926 models.\n[[File:Moteur 5HP 1924.jpg|thumb| 5HP engine 1924 ]]\n[[File:Moteur Citroen 5HP.jpg|thumb|Engine  with RB magneto]]\nTo avoid distortion of the U shaped side members, the ladder frame was trapezoidal and reinforced by cross beams .\n\nThe suspension consisted of four inverted quarter-elliptical leaf springs. Friction dampers became fitted, at the rear from 1925 on the \nheavier \u201cCabriolet\u201d.\n\nAt the end of 1923, the short chassis Type C.2 was lengthened by 10&nbsp;cm from 2.25 m (7&nbsp;ft 5 in) to 2.35m (7&nbsp;ft 9 in) and re-inforced by an additional crossbar which protruded from the rear deck and supported the rear of the body. This became the long wheelbase chassis Type C.3. The extension of the bodywork had become necessary to allow the construction of the new \"three seat\" version of the \u201cTorpedo\u201d as well as the \u201c Voiture de Livraison \u201c ( delivery car ). The lengthening can be noted by the longer distance between the spare wheel and the rear wing. This chassis was produced without modification until the end of production.\n\nThe rear axle was of the \"banjo\" type with a round or oblong (oval) shape. The teeth of the rear axle pinion were of the \"Citro\u00ebn chevron\" type. An helical cut, easier to produce and more robust became available, as replacement parts,  in 1928 .\n\nInitially, the 700x80 beaded edge Michelin \"Cabl\u00e9\" tyres were inflated at \"high pressure\", ( 4 to 5 bars) , hence a mediocre roadholding and comfort. They were replaced in June 1924 by 715x115 beaded edge Michelin \"Cabl\u00e9 Confort\" (balloon ) tyres inflated at low pressure (2.5 bars), initially offered as extra equipment and then fitted on all cars in June . 11-12x45 wired on rims appeared in 1927 with \u00ab Confort Bibendum \u00ab  tyres, low pressure (1.5 to 1.75 bars). and were fitted as replacement of original beaded edge rims .\n\n\nThe equipment level of the 5 HP being relatively basic, many component suppliers took the opportunity to offer multiple solutions to improve driving comfort or performance such as: luggage rack, petrol gauge (OS), water thermometer (Boyer-Meter), speedometer and watch (Jaeger, OS), shock absorbers (Houdaille, Repusseau), front brakes ( Poulet , Acmos), engine improvements (Super-Culasse Desprez, Transformations F. Crespelle,  Ruby-Ricardo cylinder head).\n\n== Models ==\nSource<ref>{{cite book |last1=Laurent |first1=Bernard |title=Citroen 5HP |publisher= |page=Chassis Models 29 to 47}}</ref>\n\nIn 1922-23, the \" Torpedo \" ( tourer) T2 , and the \"Cabriolet\" ( convertible ) TL, were two-seat versions on the short wheelbase chassis (C2). Then in 1924 ,the lengthening of the chassis (C3)allowed the production of : ...a long wheelbase version of the \u201c Torpedo \u201c T2 and \u201c Cabriolet \u201c TL ...the \u201c Voiture de Livraison \u201c VL , a light commercial vehicle, \u2026 .and the \u201cTorpedo\u201d three-seat version , initially with a third foldable seat : T3-1 \" a Strapontin \"  \u2026 which was replaced in October 1924 by another three-seat version T3-2 \u201c Trefle \u201c ( clover leaf ) with room for a single passenger in the rear.\n[[File:5HP C2 T2 1921.jpg|thumb|5HP C2 Torp\u00e9do 2 seater original version - Oct.1921]]\n[[File:Citroen 5HP torpedo T2 23 H.jpg|thumb|5HP C2 T2 Torpedo2 seater   ]]\n\n=== Torp\u00e9do 2 seater T2 ===\nSource<ref>{{cite web|title=Citro\u00ebn 5HP, Model T2 (Torpedo)|url=http://www.citroen-5hp.ch/en/mod/model_T2.htm|website=www.citroen-5hp.ch|access-date=2018-12-04}}</ref>\n\nProduction: Short wheelbase Chassis C2: May 1922 to September 1923 ... then Long wheelbase chassis C3: October 1923 to Spring 1925\n\n[[File:5HP T2 24-1gr 520.jpg|thumb|5HP C3 T2 Torp\u00e9do 2 seater 1924 ]]\n[[File:JML - Citroen Type C Torpedo C2 T2 1923.jpg|thumb|5HP C2 T2 1923]]\n\nIts back end gave the \u201cTorpedo\u201d a sporty look but it also added the nickname \"Cul de Poule\"( hen\u2019s bottom ).\n\nOriginal (C2-1922/23) body colour was yellow then with the introduction of the long chassis   (C3-1924/25). , colours available were : Bordeaux red, blue or Havana (brown ).\nThe comfortable bench seat was covered with leatherette initially (C2): black, then (C3): red, black (for blue cars) or brown.\n\nThe floor covering was brush carpet. \nDoor storage pockets were fitted in the door and alongside the driver.\n\nThe spare wheel was mounted on the driver's side.

Paving materials include [[asphalt concrete|asphalt]], [[concrete]], stones such as [[flagstone]], [[cobblestone]], and [[sett (paving)|setts]], [[artificial stone]], [[brick]]s, [[tile]]s, and sometimes wood. In [[landscape architecture]], pavements are part of the [[hardscape]] and are used on [[sidewalk]]s, [[road surface]]s, [[patio]]s, [[courtyard]]s, etc.\n\nThe term ''pavement'' comes from Latin ''pavimentum'', meaning a floor beaten or rammed down, through Old French ''pavement''.<ref>[http://triggs.djvu.org/century-dictionary.com/djvu2jpgframes.php?volno=05&page=779&query=pavement \"Pavement\", ''The Century Dictionary'']</ref> The meaning of a beaten-down floor was obsolete before the word entered English.<ref>\"pavement, n.\" ''Oxford English Dictionary'' Second Edition on CD-ROM (v. 4.0) Oxford University Press, 2009</ref>\n\nPavement laid in patterns like [[mosaics]] were commonly used by the Romans.\n\n==Paver==\n[[Image:Paver Blocks Exterior Circular 3008px.jpg|thumb|right|Concrete paver blocks laid in a circular pattern]]\n[[Image:PaverPatio.jpg|thumb|right|Concrete paver blocks in a rectangular pattern]]\n\nA '''paver''' is a paving stone, tile,<ref>\"paver\" def. 2.

In a factory, concrete pavers are made by pouring a mixture of concrete and some type of coloring agent into a mold of some shape and allowing to set. They are applied by pouring a standard concrete foundation, spreading sand on top, and then laying the pavers in the desired pattern. No actual [[adhesive]] or retaining method is used other than the weight of the paver itself except edging. Pavers can be used to make roads, driveways, patios, walkways and other outdoor platforms.\n\n===Interlocking concrete pavers===\n[[File:Paving stone driveway.jpg|thumb|Interlocking concrete paver driveway]]\nAn '''interlocking concrete paver''' is a type of paver. This special type of paver, also known as a '''segmental paver''', has emerged over the last couple of decades as a very popular alternative to [[brick]], [[clay]] or [[concrete]].<ref name=\"ICPI\">http://www.icpi.org/theindustry</ref>\n\nSegmental pavers have been used for thousands of years.  The [[Ancient Rome|Romans]] built roads with them that are still there.  But it was not until the mid-1940s that pavers began to be produced out of concrete.  It started in the [[Netherlands]]<ref name=\"ICPI\" /> where all the roads are made to be flexible because the country is below sea level and the ground shifts, moves and sinks.

Paving materials include [[asphalt concrete|asphalt]], [[concrete]], stones such as [[flagstone]], [[cobblestone]], and [[sett (paving)|setts]], [[artificial stone]], [[brick]]s, [[tile]]s, and sometimes wood. In [[landscape architecture]], pavements are part of the [[hardscape]] and are used on [[sidewalk]]s, [[road surface]]s, [[patio]]s, [[courtyard]]s, etc.\n\nThe term ''pavement'' comes from Latin ''pavimentum'', meaning a floor beaten or rammed down, through Old French ''pavement''.<ref>[http://triggs.djvu.org/century-dictionary.com/djvu2jpgframes.php?volno=05&page=779&query=pavement \"Pavement\", ''The Century Dictionary'']</ref> The meaning of a beaten-down floor was obsolete before the word entered English.<ref>\"pavement, n.\" ''Oxford English Dictionary'' Second Edition on CD-ROM (v. 4.0) Oxford University Press, 2009</ref>\n\nPavement laid in patterns like [[mosaics]] were commonly used by the Romans.\n\n==Paver==\n[[Image:Paver Blocks Exterior Circular 3008px.jpg|thumb|right|Concrete paver blocks laid in a circular pattern]]\n[[Image:PaverPatio.jpg|thumb|right|Concrete paver blocks in a rectangular pattern]]\n\nA '''paver''' is a paving stone, tile,<ref>\"paver\" def. 2.

In a factory, concrete pavers are made by pouring a mixture of concrete and some type of coloring agent into a mold of some shape and allowing to set. They are applied by pouring a standard concrete foundation, spreading sand on top, and then laying the pavers in the desired pattern. No actual [[adhesive]] or retaining method is used other than the weight of the paver itself except edging. Pavers can be used to make roads, driveways, patios, walkways and other outdoor platforms.\n\n===Interlocking concrete pavers===\n[[File:Paving stone driveway.jpg|thumb|Interlocking concrete paver driveway]]\nAn '''interlocking concrete paver''' is a type of paver. This special type of paver, also known as a '''segmental paver''', has emerged over the last couple of decades as a very popular alternative to [[brick]], [[clay]] or [[concrete]].<ref name=\"ICPI\">http://www.icpi.org/theindustry</ref>\n\nSegmental pavers have been used for thousands of years.  The [[Ancient Rome|Romans]] built roads with them that are still there.  But it was not until the mid-1940s that pavers began to be produced out of concrete.  It started in the [[Netherlands]]<ref name=\"ICPI\" /> where all the roads are made to be flexible because the country is below sea level and the ground shifts, moves and sinks. Poured [[concrete]] is not an option because it will crack.  Individual units not set in concrete, and placed in [[sand]] perform far better than concrete.<ref name=\"ICPI\" />  Before the paver was made from concrete, either real [[stone]] or a clay product was used.\n\nThe first concrete pavers were shaped just like a brick, 4\u201d by 8\u201d (10&nbsp;cm x 20&nbsp;cm) and they were called Holland Stones and still are today.
