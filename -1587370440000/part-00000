Objects that are inserted into the rectum can therefore potentially travel up into the [[bowel]]: the flared end on a butt plug exists to prevent this. Some dildos lack a flared end, and thus it is ill-advised to use such dildos anally since they may get stuck; [[rectal foreign body|rectal foreign bodies]] may require medical extraction.\n\nIn addition, the lower [[bowel]] above the [[rectum]] is easily perforated. For this reason, butt plugs tend to be shorter than dildos, and their marked size generally indicates the circumference of the device rather than the length. They must also be very smooth to avoid damaging the rectum or bowel. In order to get them into the rectum, they most commonly have a general profile of a round-ended cone which then narrows to a \"waist\" which locates itself at the anal sphincter, with the flared part outside the body, preventing the butt plug from slipping further into the body. The sphincter muscle will hold the plug in place by the waist, preventing the plug from slipping out unintentionally.\n\nAs with other activities involving anal penetration, such as [[anal sex]], large amounts of [[sexual lubricant]] and a slow gentle approach are needed to insert or remove a butt plug.<ref>{{cite book|author=Morin, Jack|title=Anal Pleasure and Health|edition=3rd|publisher=Down There Press|year=1998|isbn=978-0-940208-20-9}}</ref>\n\nButt plugs are sometimes covered by [[condom]]s for hygiene and to allow for the easy disposal of any [[feces]] with which they may come into contact. Nevertheless, they should not be shared with other people, due to the risk of [[blood-borne disease]]s, including [[HIV]], that can arise from the transfer of body fluids from one person to another.\n\n==Designs==\n\n\nButt plugs come in a variety of colors, shapes, sizes, and textures. Some are designed to look like [[Human penis|penises]], while some are ribbed or wavy. The majority, however, are shaped as shown in the picture above, having a thin tip which is wider in the middle, a notch to hold it in place once it is inserted, and a flared base to prevent complete insertion into the rectum. Some plugs are designed (long, flexible and curved) to penetrate the [[sigmoid colon]].\n\nButt plugs are made of a variety of materials, the most common being [[latex]]. Other materials used include [[silicone]], [[neoprene]], [[wood]], [[metal]], [[glass]], [[Rock (geology)|stone]], and many other materials. Silicone is a particularly good material, as it can be [[disinfected]] in boiling water.\n\nThere are butt plugs that \"ejaculate\" by squirting water or other viscous fluids into the rectum. There are also vibrating butt plugs, and butt plugs that can inflate and expand. Some butt plugs are specifically designed for men and [[Prostate massage|stimulate the prostate]]. Other butt plugs are manufactured with long hair or simulated animal tails attached to the base for use in [[human pony]] play or other animal fantasy role play.

D'Orio and signed by [[Alec Empire]]'s [[Digital Hardcore Recordings]] record label. The music was in the same vein of [[Atari Teenage Riot]]'s style of early [[Breakcore]] and hardcore techno with a punk edge, which led to EC8OR been overlooked by fans of digital hardcore recordings, but EC8OR employed more low-res ideas as the first album was entirely composed on [[Amiga 500]] and with a microphone.\n\nEC8OR gained considerable attention in North America in 1997, when the [[Beastie Boys]]' pet-label [[Grand Royal Records]] released \"All Of Us Can Be Rich...\", a collection of earlier material on [[Digital Hardcore Recordings]].  This led to features and press on the band in [[Rolling Stone]] and [[Alternative Press (music magazine)|Alternative Press]].\n\nThe duo released 5 albums from 1995 to 1999 and have continued to record after the great DHR implosion of the millennium, and still collaborate often, although Patric and Gina are no longer signed to Digital Hardcore Recordings. Patric would later display his dislike of the state the label is currently in, as he said in an interview \"The fact that all the bands surrounding [Atari Teenage Riot] just got used for their sellout idea\u2013to have a whole \u201cmovement\u201d and \u201cfollowers\u201d\u2013led to psychological warfare which some people didn't survive. There was no trust anymore at some point and no communication. It was very strange for [artists on the] label to read in the New Music Express or other papers all these weird, made-up stories [about them]. The records were produced with different budgets and went through different channels and distributions.

D'Orio]] and signed by [[Alec Empire]]'s [[Digital Hardcore Recordings]] record label. The music was in the same vein of [[Atari Teenage Riot]]'s style of early [[Breakcore]] and hardcore techno with a punk edge, which led to EC8OR been overlooked by fans of digital hardcore recordings, but EC8OR employed more low-res ideas as the first album was entirely composed on [[Amiga 500]] and with a microphone.\n\nEC8OR gained considerable attention in North America in 1997, when the [[Beastie Boys]]' pet-label [[Grand Royal Records]] released \"All Of Us Can Be Rich...\", a collection of earlier material on [[Digital Hardcore Recordings]].  This led to features and press on the band in [[Rolling Stone]] and [[Alternative Press (music magazine)|Alternative Press]].\n\nThe duo released 5 albums from 1995 to 1999 and have continued to record after the great DHR implosion of the millennium, and still collaborate often, although Patric and Gina are no longer signed to Digital Hardcore Recordings. Patric would later display his dislike of the state the label is currently in, as he said in an interview \"The fact that all the bands surrounding [Atari Teenage Riot] just got used for their sellout idea\u2013to have a whole \u201cmovement\u201d and \u201cfollowers\u201d\u2013led to psychological warfare which some people didn't survive. There was no trust anymore at some point and no communication.
