Mostar International Airport is considering a possible strategic partnership with investors or, alternatively, a privatisation or concession.\n\nIn November 2017, [[Eurowings]] was the first airline to schedule regular  flights from Mostar to D\u00fcsseldorf and Stuttgart with two weekly flights from May 2018.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://flyingbosnian.blogspot.com/2017/11/eurowings-mostar-flight-schedule.html|title=Bosnia and Herzegovina aviation news: \u2708Eurowings Mostar flight schedule|first=Flying|last=Bosnian|date=7 November 2017|publisher=}}</ref> On 3 May 2018, a Croatia Airlines plane landed at Mostar Airport marking the introduction of direct two weekly Mostar-Zagreb flights<ref>{{cite web|url=http://flyingbosnian.blogspot.com/2018/05/zagreb-mostar-flights-inaugurated.html|title=Bosnia and Herzegovina aviation news: \u2708Zagreb-Mostar flights inaugurated|first=Flying|last=Bosnian|date=4 May 2018|publisher=}}</ref>\n\n==Airlines and destinations==\n{{Airport-dest-list\n<!-- -->\n|[[Air Horizont]] | '''Seasonal charter:''' [[Milan Malpensa Airport|Milan\u2013Malpensa]]<ref name=\"mostar-airport.ba\">https://mostar-airport.ba/red-letenja Red letenja</ref>\n<!--\n|[[AlbaStar]] | '''Seasonal charter:''' [[Milan Malpensa Airport|Milan\u2013Malpensa]], [[Leonardo da Vinci\u2013Fiumicino Airport|Rome\u2013Fiumicino]]<ref>https://mostar-airport.ba/red-letenja Red letenja</ref> -->\n<!-- -->\n|[[Croatia Airlines]] | [[Zagreb Airport|Zagreb]]<br>'''Seasonal charter:''' [[Beirut\u2013Rafic Hariri International Airport|Beirut]]<ref name=\"mostar-airport.ba\">https://mostar-airport.ba/red-letenja Red letenja</ref>\n<!--|[[Eurowings]] | '''Seasonal:''' [[D\u00fcsseldorf Airport|D\u00fcsseldorf]], [[Stuttgart Airport|Stuttgart]]<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.eurowings.com/us/discover/destinations/route-network.html|title=Route network - Discover - Eurowings|website=www.eurowings.com}}</ref>-->\n<!-- -->\n|[[FlyBosnia]] | [[Leonardo da Vinci\u2013Fiumicino Airport|Rome\u2013Fiumicino]]<br>'''Seasonal charter:''' [[Bari Karol Wojty\u0142a Airport|Bari]],<ref name=\"FlyBosnia\"/> [[Catania\u2013Fontanarossa Airport|Catania]], [[Naples International Airport|Naples]]<ref name=\"FlyBosnia\">{{cite web|url=http://flyingbosnian.blogspot.com/2019/08/flybosnia-adds-italy-mostar-charter.html|title=FlyBosnia adds Italy-Mostar charter flights|date=31 August 2019|publisher=flyingbosnian.blogspot.com}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://flyingbosnian.blogspot.com/2019/10/mostar-winter-2019-20.html|title=Mostar Winter 2019-20|date=25 October 2019|publisher=flyingbosnian.blogspot.com}}</ref>\n<!-- -->\n}}\n\n==Statistics==\n\nThe record number of 86.000 passengers was recorded in the year 1990.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://mostar-airport.ba/ba/o-nama|title=Zra\u010dna luka Mostar|website=mostar-airport.ba}}</ref>\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+ Passenger statistics<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bhdca.gov.ba/index.php/en/|title=Home page|website=www.bhdca.gov.ba}}</ref>\n|-\n!

His work gestures towards the theatricality of [[minimalism]] and [[Formalism (art)|formalism]], there's a focus on materiality, alchemy, and with light and space.\n\n''\"My work is my best attempt at giving the impossible, the infinite, a physical, objective existence. The materials are merely an extension of the gesture. I start with the gesture and have spent decades distilling these concepts down to the essential. So whether I\u2019m using vanguard, illustrious materials and high technology or centuries old metal techniques \u2014 my interest is in communicating the most direct way I can. There is a minimalistic simplicity to the work, yet it expresses something infinite \u2014 it\u2019s a pluralistic paradox.

He studied in [[London]] at [[Central Saint Martins College of Art and Design]] and graduated with a degree in fine art painting. James has also called New York City, Munich, and Los Angeles home.

It consisted of several variously sized, vertical light boxes with young birch tree trunks inside. The sculpture series references the containment and simulation of nature. The works have mirrored sides, which give the illusion of an endless birch forest. The pieces are comprised of birch trees, metal, glass, and fluorescent lights or LEDs. The birch tree is associated with magical symbolism. [[Glenn O'Brien|Glenn O\u2019Brien]] wrote about birch trees that their \u201cmagic...is rooted in [the] special relationship with fly agaric mushrooms - that famed toadstool of the red cap and white spots - which is so often associated with elves and spirits...Many anthropologists consider it to be a possible agent of the transformation of human consciousness.\u201d<ref>Glenn O\u2019Brien, \u201cCasual Magic: The Art of Anthony James\u201d, Morphic Fields, Munich: Hatje Cantz Verlag, 2014, pp. 58-71.</ref> Of the series, James said, \"''I think about the containment of nature. The containment of our own nature. There\u2019s something about the individuals journey that is really at the root of it. Going into the forest \u2014 not knowing what you\u2019ll find \u2014 not knowing if you\u2019ll ever return... You can see the metaphor.\"''\n\n'''Morphic Fields, 2014'''\n\nMorphic Fields was an exhibition of bronze and limestone pieces inspired by the scientist [[Rupert Sheldrake]]\u2019s theory of morphic resonance: \u201ca process whereby self-organizing systems inherit a memory from previous similar systems.\u201d<ref>Glenn O\u2019Brien, \u201cCasual Magic: The Art of Anthony James\u201d, Morphic Fields, Munich: Hatje Cantz Verlag, 2014, pp. 58-71.</ref> Sheldrake describes his theory relative to the artistic process: \u201cEvery morphic fields starts with some creative step. Newton was the first person to think of the law of gravity. And before he\u2019d thought of it, no one else had. Since then, millions of people have been able to think of it. So all morphic fields begin with individuals\u2026Very few contemporary artists have the sense of inspiration from a transcendent source beyond the human realm. But I would argue that they are also drawing from the collective human experience. As much as there is room for individual creativity, every artist is also transcending collective memory. Artists can create new morphic fields. Yet, all art exists within a morphic field beyond the individual.\u201d<ref>Katja Eichinger, \u201cAn Interview with Rupert Sheldrake\u201d, Morphic Fields, Munich: Hatje Cantz Verlag, 2014, pp. 52-57.</ref> The sculptures are created from found materials and \u201cthrough [James\u2019] process of converting...waste into bronze they morph into something very beautiful and precious.\u201d<ref>Matthias Muhling, \u201cAn Interview with Anthony James\u201d, Morphic Fields, Munich: Hatje Cantz Verlag, 2014, pp. 77-89.</ref>\n\n'''Shields, 2016-Present'''\n\nShields was an exhibition of curved disks made of brass, bronze, and steel \u201cscarred with [[Minimalism|minimalist]] markings.\u201d This series \u201coperates elusively, staggering between the iconic and the arbitrary, the concrete and the alchemic, the mythical and experiential.\u201d<ref> Fort Gansevoort, https://static1.squarespace.com/static/55ee2fc1e4b0c1020ff7e01a/t/591f29c103596e77e94503c7/1495214536115/FG_AnthonyJames_PressRelease_FINAL.pdf, \u201cAnthony James/Fabulism\u201d, 2017.</ref> James describes his work as, \u201cevoking pictorial depictions of the [[cosmos]], alluding to notions of mysticism, ethereality, and science fiction, all the while anchored through the use of weighty, industrial materials such as metal.\"<ref> Fort Gansevoort, https://static1.squarespace.com/static/55ee2fc1e4b0c1020ff7e01a/t/591f29c103596e77e94503c7/1495214536115/FG_AnthonyJames_PressRelease_FINAL.pdf, \u201cAnthony James/Fabulism\u201d, 2017.</ref> The shields \u201cread as relics or artifacts from some liminal moment, as such, James attempts to locate beauty in the wake of insanity.\u201d<ref>Fort Gansevoort, https://static1.squarespace.com/static/55ee2fc1e4b0c1020ff7e01a/t/591f29c103596e77e94503c7/1495214536115/FG_AnthonyJames_PressRelease_FINAL.pdf, \u201cAnthony James/Fabulism\u201d, 2017.</ref>\n\n'''Rain Paintings, 2018'''\n\nA photorealistic series made of contradictory materials: Belgian linen, gesso, and [https://www.ppgdeltron.com Deltron]. \u201cPurity is an illusion. The timeless, cleansing rain evoked by James\u2019 paintings is artificial. The viewer can encounter the work through a meditative fascination with its lucid intricacy \u2013 the eternal and universal behavior of water. And the aesthetic pleasure of this is intense. But to read it as only beautiful or mystical is to miss the logic of contradiction that gives the work its conceptual strength, the spray of toxic industrial paint onto an object recognizable to any old-master artist\u2019s apprentice. Therefore, in a larger sense, this work presents an argument for combination and exchange over homogeneity and conformity. James\u2019 new mode of painting can be read as a critique of easy simulation, of virtuality, in relation to both traditional illusionism and the digital. By layering contrasting material processes to create a seeming unity, a surface of streaming water, these works insist on the real over the hyperreal and on the assembled, heterogeneous, contested nature of that reality.\u201d<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://there-there.co/therethere-exhibitions|title=exhibitions|website=there-there|language=en-US|access-date=2020-04-03}}</ref>\n\n'''Neons, 2002-present'''\n\nColorful rings of neon nod to the ancient concept of the universe as set of concentric planetary orbits.

The hue and intensity of the colors are designed to create white light. The historical references here span empirical experimentation with prisms to the image, across cultures, of the universe-wheel. [[Neon]] is already in our time a somewhat outworn material and the visible wires and plugs that trail from the vibrant rings interrupt any illusions of transcendence. This is the paradox that James\u2019 objects show, a formal certainty and perspicuity (exact symmetry, white light, accurate shape) that registers a loss of purity or autonomy or wholeness.
