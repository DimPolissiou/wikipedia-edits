Containment is undertaken in the early stages of the outbreak and aims to trace and isolate those infected as well as introduce other measures of infection control and vaccinations to stop the disease from spreading to the rest of the population. When it is no longer possible to contain the spread of the disease, efforts then move to the mitigation stage: measures are taken to slow the spread and mitigate its effects on the healthcare system and society. A combination of both containment and mitigation measures may be undertaken at the same time.<ref name=\"NY0JD\" /> Suppression requires more extreme measures so as to reverse the pandemic by reducing the [[basic reproduction number]] to less than 1.<ref name=\"ImpCollege16mar2020\" />\n\nPart of managing an infectious disease outbreak is trying to decrease the epidemic peak, known as flattening the epidemic curve.<ref name=\"Lancet2020Flatten\" /> This decreases the risk of health services being overwhelmed and provides more time for vaccines and treatments to be developed.<ref name=\"Lancet2020Flatten\" /> Non-pharmaceutical interventions that may manage the outbreak include personal preventive measures, such as hand hygiene, wearing face masks, and self-quarantine; community measures aimed at physical distancing such as closing schools and cancelling mass gathering events; community engagement to encourage acceptance and participation in such interventions; as well as environmental measures such surface cleaning.<ref name=\"community mitigation\" />\n\nMore drastic actions aimed at containing the outbreak were taken in China once the severity of the outbreak became apparent, such as quarantining entire cities and imposing strict travel bans.<ref name=\"RwmYm\" /> Other countries also adopted a variety of measures aimed at limiting the spread of the virus. South Korea introduced mass screening and localised quarantines, and issued alerts on the movements of infected individuals. Singapore provided financial support for those infected who quarantined themselves and imposed large fines for those who failed to do so. Taiwan increased face mask production and penalised hoarding of medical supplies.<ref name=\"shZdf\" />\n\nSimulations for Great Britain and the United States show that mitigation (slowing but not stopping epidemic spread) and suppression (reversing epidemic growth) have major challenges.<!--ref name=ImpCollege16mar2020--> Optimal mitigation policies might reduce peak healthcare demand by two-thirds and deaths by half, but still result in hundreds of thousands of deaths and overwhelmed health systems.<!--ref name=ImpCollege16mar2020--> Suppression can be preferred but needs to be maintained for as long as the virus is circulating in the human population (or until a vaccine becomes available), as transmission otherwise quickly rebounds when measures are relaxed. Long-term intervention to suppress the pandemic has considerable social and economic costs.<ref name=\"ImpCollege16mar2020\" />\n\n====Contact tracing====\n\n[[Contact tracing]] is an important method for health authorities to determine the source of an infection and to prevent further transmission.<ref name=\"web\" /> The use of location data from mobile phones by governments for this purpose has

Containment is undertaken in the early stages of the outbreak and aims to trace and isolate those infected as well as introduce other measures of infection control and vaccinations to stop the disease from spreading to the rest of the population. When it is no longer possible to contain the spread of the disease, efforts then move to the mitigation stage: measures are taken to slow the spread and mitigate its effects on the healthcare system and society. A combination of both containment and mitigation measures may be undertaken at the same time.<ref name=\"NY0JD\" /> Suppression requires more extreme measures so as to reverse the pandemic by reducing the [[basic reproduction number]] to less than 1.<ref name=\"ImpCollege16mar2020\" />\n\nPart of managing an infectious disease outbreak is trying to decrease the epidemic peak, known as flattening the epidemic curve.<ref name=\"Lancet2020Flatten\" /> This decreases the risk of health services being overwhelmed and provides more time for vaccines and treatments to be developed.<ref name=\"Lancet2020Flatten\" /> Non-pharmaceutical interventions that may manage the outbreak include personal preventive measures, such as hand hygiene, wearing face masks, and self-quarantine; community measures aimed at physical distancing such as closing schools and cancelling mass gathering events; community engagement to encourage acceptance and participation in such interventions; as well as environmental measures such surface cleaning.<ref name=\"community mitigation\" />\n\nMore drastic actions aimed at containing the outbreak were taken in China once the severity of the outbreak became apparent, such as quarantining entire cities and imposing strict travel bans.<ref name=\"RwmYm\" /> Other countries also adopted a variety of measures aimed at limiting the spread of the virus. South Korea introduced mass screening and localised quarantines, and issued alerts on the movements of infected individuals. Singapore provided financial support for those infected who quarantined themselves and imposed large fines for those who failed to do so. Taiwan increased face mask production and penalised hoarding of medical supplies.<ref name=\"shZdf\" />\n\nSimulations for Great Britain and the United States show that mitigation (slowing but not stopping epidemic spread) and suppression (reversing epidemic growth) have major challenges.<!--ref name=ImpCollege16mar2020--> Optimal mitigation policies might reduce peak healthcare demand by two-thirds and deaths by half, but still result in hundreds of thousands of deaths and overwhelmed health systems.<!--ref name=ImpCollege16mar2020--> Suppression can be preferred but needs to be maintained for as long as the virus is circulating in the human population (or until a vaccine becomes available), as transmission otherwise quickly rebounds when measures are relaxed. Long-term intervention to suppress the pandemic has considerable social and economic costs.<ref name=\"ImpCollege16mar2020\" />\n\n====Contact tracing====\n\n[[Contact tracing]] is an important method for health authorities to determine the source of an infection and to prevent further transmission.<ref name=\"web\" /> The use of location data from mobile phones by governments for this purpose has

Aircraft of up to 80 tons were envisaged. The primary runway was to be designed for use in all weathers and at night, with a {{convert|400|m|adj=on}}-wide hard surface running to {{convert|3000|m}} in length. Additional {{convert|100|m|adj=on}} areas were to be provided on the shoulders for lateral protection in case of [[runway excursion]]s. Additional domestic runways, between {{convert|1000|and|1400|m}} in length, were also to be built.<ref name=\"fae\"/>\n\nThe first flights from the west runway were not until 1948. The new terminal opened in 1953 with a large air show that ran three days. In 1947, the airport handled 133,638 passengers on 12,766 airline flights; in 1952, 372,832 passengers on 24,728 airline flights. The first expansion of the airport was submitted in 1956; the Swiss government approved the budget for the expansion in 1958, and the expansion was completed in 1961.<ref name=zahist/><ref>{{cite journal| work=American Aviation| date=3 August 1953| title=Unk| page=35| volume=16}}</ref>\n\nThe airport was again submitted and approved for renovation in 1970, and Terminal B was completed in 1971. The first signs of noise mitigation for the airport were in 1972, when a night-time curfew was enacted, as well as in 1974 when new approach routes were introduced. Runway 14/32 was opened in 1976, and 16/34 began renovation.<ref name=zahist/>\n\n===1980 onwards===\nThe noise of aircraft became an issue at Zurich Airport; a noise charge was instituted in 1980, and in 1984 airport officials made an agreement regarding arrivals and departures to the airport via German airspace. The next major event for the airport was in 1999, when the Parliament of the canton of Z\u00fcrich approved privatization of Zurich Airport. The following year, Flughafen Z\u00fcrich AG, trading under the brand ''Unique'', became the new airport operator. The company dropped the brand ''Unique'' in favour of ''Zurich Airport'' and ''Flughafen Z\u00fcrich'' in 2010.<ref name=zahist/><ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.zurich-airport.com/Portaldata/2/Resources/documents/shopping_gastronomie/airmagazin_winter_2009_10_11/AIR_Winter09_Book.pdf| title=New name for Zurich Airport| work=Lifestyle & Shopping Magazine| publisher=Flughafen Z\u00fcrich| issue=Winter 2009/2010| accessdate=2013-06-18| page=11}}{{Dead link|date=July 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>\n\nOn 2 October 2001, a major cash-flow crisis at [[Swissair]], exacerbated by the global downturn in air travel caused by the [[September 11 attacks]], caused the airline to ground all its flights. Although a government rescue plan permitted some flights to restart a few days later, and the airline's assets were subsequently sold to become [[Swiss International Air Lines]], the airport lost a large volume of traffic. After [[Lufthansa]] took control of Swiss International Air Lines in 2005, traffic began to grow again.\n\nOn 18 October 2001, Germany and Switzerland signed a treaty regarding the limitation of flights over Germany. Under the terms of this treaty, any incoming aircraft after 22:00 had to approach Z\u00fcrich from the east to land on runway 28, which, unlike the airport's other runways, was not equipped with an [[instrument landing system]]. A month later, at 22:06 on 24 November, an inbound [[Crossair]] [[Avro RJ100]] using this approach in conditions of poor visibility [[Crossair Flight 3597|crashed into a range of hills]] near [[Bassersdorf]] and exploded, killing 24 of the 33 people on board. The flight had originally been scheduled to land on runway 14 before 22:00, but it was subject to delay and was therefore diverted to runway 28.<ref name=zahist/><ref name=\":0\">{{ASN accident| title=HB-IXM| id=20011124-0| accessdate=1 May 2015}}</ref>\n\nZurich Airport completed a major expansion project in 2003, in which it built a new parking garage, a new midfield terminal, and an automated underground [[people mover]] to link the midfield terminal to the main terminal. In November 2008 a complete renovation and rebuild of the old terminal B structure was announced. The new terminal B opened in November 2011, and provides segregated access to and from aircraft for [[Schengen Area|Schengen]] and non-Schengen passengers.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.zurich-airport.com/desktopdefault.aspx/tabid-515/| title=Dock B| publisher=Zurich Airport| accessdate=2013-06-17| url-status=dead| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120404190615/http://www.zurich-airport.com/desktopdefault.aspx/tabid-515/| archivedate=2012-04-04}}</ref> Zurich Airport handled 25.5 million passengers in 2014, up 2.5 percent from 2013.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.thelocal.ch/20150114/zurich-airport-passenger-count-hits-new-record| title=Zurich airport passenger count hits new record| work=[[The Local]]| date=14 January 2014| accessdate=29 June 2017}}</ref>\n\nEtihad Regional<!-- Please note that Ethiad Regional and Darwin Airline are identical, so separate linking is not necessary.--> ceased on 18 February 2015 to fly two-thirds of its scheduled routes without further notice, amongst them all its services from Z\u00fcrich except the domestic service to [[Geneva Airport|Geneva]].<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.anna.aero/2015/01/28/etihad-regional-drops-four-routes-from-geneva-and-zurich/| title=Etihad Regional points finger at SWISS/Lufthansa as airline drops four routes| work=[[Anna.aero]]| accessdate=28 January 2015}}</ref><ref name=\"cancellations\">{{cite web| url=http://www.austrianaviation.net/news-international/news-detail/datum/2015/02/18/etihad-regional-streicht-erneut-fluege.html| title=Etihad Regional streicht erneut Fl\u00fcge| trans-title=Etihad Regional will again take flight| work=austrianaviation.net| accessdate=29 June 2017| language=German}}</ref><ref name=\"cancellations2\">{{cite web| url=http://www.aerotelegraph.com/schweiz-etihad-regional-darwin-airline-rueckzug-zuerich-kuendigungen-swiss-beschwerde| title=Etihad Regional zieht aus Z\u00fcrich ab| trans-title=Etihad Regional departs from Zurich| date=18 February 2015| work=aeroTELEGRAPH| accessdate=29 June 2017}}</ref> Etihad Regional blamed the failure of its expansion on the behavior of competitors, especially [[Swiss International Air Lines]], as well as the Swiss aviation authorities.<ref name=\"cancellations\"/>\n\nAs a consequence of the [[2016 Brussels bombings|bombings in Brussels on 22 March 2016]], which caused the temporary closure of [[Brussels Airport]], [[Brussels Airlines]] stationed three [[Airbus A330]]s at Zurich Airport to offer flights to several African countries for the duration of the closure.<ref>{{cite web| url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/travel/flights/todayinthesky/2016/03/28/brussels-airport-closed-least-through-tuesday-possibly-longer/82336252/| title=Brussels Airport closed at least through Tuesday, likely longer| first=Ben| last=Mutzabaugh| work=[[USA Today]]| date=28 March 2016| accessdate=29 June 2017}}</ref>\n\n==Corporate affairs==\nThe airport is owned by [[Flughafen Z\u00fcrich AG]], a company quoted on the [[SIX Swiss Exchange]].

Alongside the ''Airside Center'', the ground-side terminal complex named ''Airport Center'' comprises several buildings, and includes airline check-in areas, a shopping mall, a railway station, car parks, and a bus and tram terminal. All departing passengers access the same departure level of the ''Airside Center'', which includes duty-free shopping and various bars and restaurants, via airport security. They are then segregated between passengers for Schengen and non-Schengen destinations on the way to the gate lounges, with the latter first passing through emigration controls. Arriving Schengen and non-Schengen passengers are handled in separate areas of the ''Airside Center'' and reach the ''Airport Center'' by different routes, with non-Schengen passengers first passing through immigration controls.<ref name=\"officialnaming\">{{cite web| url=http://www.zurich-airport.com/passengers-and-visitors/airport-services-en/site-plans| title=Site Plans| publisher=Zurich Airport| accessdate=2014-10-01}}</ref><ref name=iftp>{{cite web| url=http://www.zurich-airport.com/Portaldata/2/Resources/documents/dienstleistungen/Flyer_Transferinformation_0313.pdf| title=Information for transfer passengers| publisher=Zurich Airport| accessdate=2013-06-17| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131102003922/http://www.zurich-airport.com/Portaldata/2/Resources/documents/dienstleistungen/Flyer_Transferinformation_0313.pdf| archive-date=2013-11-02| url-status=dead}}</ref> The three airside terminals are:\n\n;Terminal A\nTerminal A contains gates prefixed A.

Aircraft of up to 80 tons were envisaged. The primary runway was to be designed for use in all weathers and at night, with a {{convert|400|m|adj=on}}-wide hard surface running to {{convert|3000|m}} in length. Additional {{convert|100|m|adj=on}} areas were to be provided on the shoulders for lateral protection in case of [[runway excursion]]s. Additional domestic runways, between {{convert|1000|and|1400|m}} in length, were also to be built.<ref name=\"fae\"/>\n\nThe first flights from the west runway were not until 1948. The new terminal opened in 1953 with a large air show that ran three days. In 1947, the airport handled 133,638 passengers on 12,766 airline flights; in 1952, 372,832 passengers on 24,728 airline flights. The first expansion of the airport was submitted in 1956; the Swiss government approved the budget for the expansion in 1958, and the expansion was completed in 1961.<ref name=zahist/><ref>{{cite journal| work=American Aviation| date=3 August 1953| title=Unk| page=35| volume=16}}</ref>\n\nThe airport was again submitted and approved for renovation in 1970, and Terminal B was completed in 1971. The first signs of noise mitigation for the airport were in 1972, when a night-time curfew was enacted, as well as in 1974 when new approach routes were introduced. Runway 14/32 was opened in 1976, and 16/34 began renovation.<ref name=zahist/>\n\n===1980 onwards===\nThe noise of aircraft became an issue at Zurich Airport; a noise charge was instituted in 1980, and in 1984 airport officials made an agreement regarding arrivals and departures to the airport via German airspace. The next major event for the airport was in 1999, when the Parliament of the canton of Z\u00fcrich approved privatization of Zurich Airport. The following year, Flughafen Z\u00fcrich AG, trading under the brand ''Unique'', became the new airport operator. The company dropped the brand ''Unique'' in favour of ''Zurich Airport'' and ''Flughafen Z\u00fcrich'' in 2010.<ref name=zahist/><ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.zurich-airport.com/Portaldata/2/Resources/documents/shopping_gastronomie/airmagazin_winter_2009_10_11/AIR_Winter09_Book.pdf| title=New name for Zurich Airport| work=Lifestyle & Shopping Magazine| publisher=Flughafen Z\u00fcrich| issue=Winter 2009/2010| accessdate=2013-06-18| page=11}}{{Dead link|date=July 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>\n\nOn 2 October 2001, a major cash-flow crisis at [[Swissair]], exacerbated by the global downturn in air travel caused by the [[September 11 attacks]], caused the airline to ground all its flights. Although a government rescue plan permitted some flights to restart a few days later, and the airline's assets were subsequently sold to become [[Swiss International Air Lines]], the airport lost a large volume of traffic. After [[Lufthansa]] took control of Swiss International Air Lines in 2005, traffic began to grow again.\n\nOn 18 October 2001, Germany and Switzerland signed a treaty regarding the limitation of flights over Germany. Under the terms of this treaty, any incoming aircraft after 22:00 had to approach Z\u00fcrich from the east to land on runway 28, which, unlike the airport's other runways, was not equipped with an [[instrument landing system]]. A month later, at 22:06 on 24 November, an inbound [[Crossair]] [[Avro RJ100]] using this approach in conditions of poor visibility [[Crossair Flight 3597|crashed into a range of hills]] near [[Bassersdorf]] and exploded, killing 24 of the 33 people on board.

These are linked to a central air-side building called ''Airside Center'', built in 2003. Alongside the ''Airside Center'', the ground-side terminal complex named ''Airport Center'' comprises several buildings, and includes airline check-in areas, a shopping mall, a railway station, car parks, and a bus and tram terminal. All departing passengers access the same departure level of the ''Airside Center'', which includes duty-free shopping and various bars and restaurants, via airport security. They are then segregated between passengers for Schengen and non-Schengen destinations on the way to the gate lounges, with the latter first passing through emigration controls. Arriving Schengen and non-Schengen passengers are handled in separate areas of the ''Airside Center'' and reach the ''Airport Center'' by different routes, with non-Schengen passengers first passing through immigration controls.<ref name=\"officialnaming\">{{cite web| url=http://www.zurich-airport.com/passengers-and-visitors/airport-services-en/site-plans| title=Site Plans| publisher=Zurich Airport| accessdate=2014-10-01}}</ref><ref name=iftp>{{cite web| url=http://www.zurich-airport.com/Portaldata/2/Resources/documents/dienstleistungen/Flyer_Transferinformation_0313.pdf| title=Information for transfer passengers| publisher=Zurich Airport| accessdate=2013-06-17| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131102003922/http://www.zurich-airport.com/Portaldata/2/Resources/documents/dienstleistungen/Flyer_Transferinformation_0313.pdf| archive-date=2013-11-02| url-status=dead}}</ref> The three airside terminals are:\n\n;Terminal A\nTerminal A contains gates prefixed A.

It opened in 1975 and reopened in November 2011 after an extensive three-year reconstruction. Like terminal A, it takes the form of a finger pier directly connected at one end to the ''Airside Centre''. Since reconstruction, it can accommodate both Schengen and non-Schengen flights at the same gates.

It is a stand-alone satellite terminal located on the opposite side of runway 10/28 from the ''Airside Center'', and is situated between runways 16/34 and 14/32. It is entirely used by non-Schengen international flights and became operational and was opened on September 1, 2003.

A gas explosion blew out some load-bearing walls, causing the collapse of one entire corner of the building, which killed four people and injured 17. The spectacular nature of the failure (caused by both poor design and poor construction), led to a loss of public confidence in high-rise residential buildings, and major changes in UK building regulations resulted.\n\n==Construction==\nRonan Point, named after Deputy Mayor Harry Ronan (a former Chairman of the Housing Committee of the London Borough of Newham), was part of the wave of tower blocks built in the 1960s as cheap, affordable [[Prefabricated building|prefabricated housing]] for inhabitants of [[West Ham]] and other areas of London. The tower was built by [[Taylor Woodrow|Taylor Woodrow Anglian]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/may/16/newsid_2514000/2514277.stm|title=\t\n1968: Three die as tower block collapses|publisher=BBC|accessdate=16 June 2016}}</ref> using a technique known as [[Plattenbau|large panel system building]] (LPS), which involves casting large concrete prefabricated sections off-site and bolting them together to construct the building.

It is believed that the weaknesses were in the joints connecting the vertical walls to the floor slabs. The flank walls fell away, leaving the floors above unsupported and causing the [[progressive collapse]] of the south-east corner of the building.<ref>https://www.logic4training.co.uk/blog/safety/on-this-day-in-1968/</ref>\n\nThe building had just opened, and three of the four flats immediately above Hodge's were unoccupied. Four of the 260 residents were killed immediately and seventeen were injured, including a young mother who was stranded on a narrow ledge when the rest of her living room disappeared. Hodge survived, despite being blown across the room by the explosion \u2014 as was her gas stove, which she took to her new address.<ref name=Collapse/>\n\n==Griffiths inquiry==\n{{anchor|Other defects}}<!-- left in case anything #links here -- but Griffiths inquiry now is the target of one link-->\nIn the immediate aftermath of the collapse, the government commissioned an inquiry, led by [[Hugh Griffiths, Baron Griffiths|Hugh Griffiths]], [[Queen's Counsel|QC]]. It reported on dangers caused by pressure on the walls from explosion, wind, or fire, finding that although the design had complied with the current regulations,\n*it was not adequate for even small explosions, as proved by the actual collapse, where lack of injury to the person who lit the match demonstrated the pressure had been low\n*it was not adequate for expected wind loading, since the wind speeds which the regulations required to be considered were much too low for a tall building\u2014in a high wind, an upper wall panel could be sucked out, leading to collapse similar to the actual collapse\n*it was not adequate in a fire, a significant fire could lead to bowing of the structure, followed by collapse as above.<ref name=forensic>{{cite book |authorlink= Norbert J.

However, public confidence in the safety of residential tower blocks was irreparably shaken,<ref name=modernity>{{cite web |url= http://www.open.edu/openlearn/history-the-arts/history/heritage/ronan-point |title= Ronan Point |accessdate=31 October 2014}}</ref> and the public skepticism was later found to be appropriate.<ref name=forensic/>\n\nSome people, including [[Sam Webb (architect)|Sam Webb]], an architect who had given evidence to the Griffiths inquiry, were not satisfied that every issue had been properly investigated. It was later shown that:\n*the assumptions made in determining the revised wind loading were inadequate, in that they assumed all windows were closed. However, if the glass in a window had broken, or somebody had gone out leaving a window open, a wall panel could suffer pressure on one side and suction on the other, to an extent that the panels on the upper levels of the building might still be sucked out\n*construction defects (failure to build as designed) had left unfilled gaps between floors and walls throughout, hidden only by skirting boards and ceiling paper, which left the building without fire separation (or acoustic separation) between flats. Tall blocks of flats in the UK are permitted relatively narrow staircases because the requirement for full fire separation between floors means that in theory, it is safer for people above the fire to stay in their flats rather than walk down the stairs. (This theory does not hold where the fire separation fails, as happened in the [[Grenfell Tower fire]]). Without fire separation it would be necessary for all people above a fire to escape, which would not be possible using the existing narrow staircases.\n*further construction defects had led to the whole weight supported by each wall panel being supported by the panel beneath by two steel rods, instead of being spread evenly along the panel, leading to extremely high stresses that the concrete was not designed to withstand\n*the strengthening brackets which had been fitted during the rebuilding were in many cases not properly attached, since they were fastened to hollow-core slabs, and in many cases they had been bolted only to the thin concrete surrounding the cores, which was inadequate to take the stress.<ref name=forensic/>\n\nThe concern, most particularly about the fire separation issue, eventually led the council to evacuate the building, and then to [[demolition|demolish]] it in 1986 in a forensic manner (rather than, for example, using explosives). When this was done, the extent of the defects found shocked even some of the activists, such as the architect Sam Webb, who had been lobbying for years that the building was unsafe. On the lower floors, cracks were found in the concrete where it had been point loaded, and it was alleged that the extra pressure on those points during a high wind (such as during the [[Great Storm of 1987]], barely a year after the demolition) would soon have led to building collapse.<ref name=forensic/>\n\n==Effect on legislation==\nThe partial collapse of Ronan Point led to major changes in building regulations. The first of these came with the 5th Amendment to the [[building regulations in the United Kingdom|Building Regulations]] in 1970. These are now embodied in Part A of the Building Regulations and cover \u201cDisproportionate Collapse\u201d. They require that \u201cthe building shall be constructed so that in the event of an accident the building will not suffer collapse to an extent disproportionate to the cause\u201d. They specifically cover pressures which may be caused for example by wind forces, explosions (either internal or external), or vehicle incursions, and note that seismic design may occasionally be required.<ref>{{cite web |title= Approved Document A - Structure (2004 Edition incorporating 2010 and 2013 amendments) |work= The Building Regulations 2010 |publisher= HM Government |date= September 2013|edition=reprint |url= http://www.planningportal.gov.uk/uploads/br/BR_PDF_AD_A_2013.pdf |accessdate= 3 March 2014}}</ref>\n\nImmediately after the publication of the report the Government brought out interim measures to ensure the safety and integrity of buildings in the event of an explosion. All new buildings of over five storeys constructed after November 1968 were required to be able to resist an explosive force of {{convert|34|kPa|abbr=on|lk=on}}\u2014that value still being relevant in 2014. Existing buildings were allowed to resist an explosive force of {{convert|17|kPa|abbr=on}}, provided that the gas supply was removed and flats were refitted for electric cooking and heating. The gas supply was removed from Ronan Point and the other eight blocks on the estate.\n\nIt has been said that the location of the explosion, on the fifth floor from the top of the building, was critical to the collapse. If it had been much higher, the lesser momentum of the debris falling onto the floor of the explosion flat would not have caused its collapse, even though it might have sustained some damage, and the progressive collapse of the floors beneath would therefore not have occurred. If it had been much lower, the friction of the joints, under the great weight of the building above, would have prevented the wall panels from blowing out, and there would have been no structural damage at all. {{Citation needed|date=June 2017}} <!-- The open.edu article seems to say the opposite, but I am not sure. --Mopskatze --> The reason that an explosion lower down the block would not have affected the load walls is that the combined mass of all the load above it creates force downwards due to gravity that would have required far greater lateral forces to create catastrophic structural failure and there are specific equilibrium equations used by civil engineers to calculate such forces. The principle layman explanation is this: the lateral force required to blow out the upper floor walls is in linear proportion to the vertical load above multiplied by the lateral frictional resistance, and [[Mohr's circle]] calculations bear this out. \n\nThis may also be why no other such collapse had occurred worldwide at the time. Nonetheless, it demonstrated an area of design which had not previously been considered. Many other jurisdictions, including the US, have since amended their building codes to require that buildings subject to explosions or other accidents will not collapse to an extent disproportionate to the cause.<ref name=forensic/>\n\nTwo days after the Grenfell Tower fire in 2017, John Knapton, emeritus professor of structural engineering at [[Newcastle University]], claimed that regulations which came into force in 1971, following lessons learned from Ronan Point, had improved building structural strength in such a way as to prevent the collapse of the Grenfell Tower, which was built in 1974.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2017/06/14/grenfell-tower-would-have-collapsed-built-four-years-earlier/|title=Grenfell Tower would have collapsed if built four years earlier, says expert|work=Daily Telegraph|date=14 June 2017|accessdate=16 June 2017}}</ref>\n\n==Effect on housing==\nNewham Council voted in 1984 to demolish Ronan Point. All nine blocks on the Freemason Estate, comprising 990 flats, were demolished in 1986 and the area was redeveloped with two-storey houses with gardens.<ref name=modernity/> Many other similar LPS buildings have since been demolished.\n\nThe [[Building Research Establishment]] published a series of reports in the 1980s to advise local councils and building owners on checking the structural stability of their LPS blocks. The contents of two of the reports relied on local authorities sending returns in to the [[Ministry of Housing and Local Government]] during 1968 and 1969. This was not exhaustive, with many authorities failing to do so and thus not having their blocks assessed after the issue of interim structural methods by the Ministry in 1968\u201369. Among these authorities were [[London Borough of Lambeth|Lambeth]] and [[London Borough of Southwark|Southwark]] in London, and [[Birmingham City Council|Birmingham]]. Birmingham owned over 300 LPS blocks, and when these were assessed in 1998 it was found that a number which did not meet 5 psi (34&nbsp;kN/m\u00b2) still had a piped gas supply. A number of those blocks were demolished. The London Borough of Southwark owns the largest LPS estate in the UK, the [[Aylesbury Estate]], which has a piped gas supply; it has been questioned{{by whom?|date=November 2016}} whether the structure is strong enough to resist a 5 psi explosion. Southwark Council admitted in 2017 that strengthening work ordered after Ronan Point may not have been carried out on the [[Ledbury Estate]], after structural weaknesses were found that led to the evacuation of four tower blocks.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-london-40891474|title=South London estate to be evacuated over safety fears - BBC News|work=[[BBC Online]]|accessdate=10 August 2017}}</ref>\n\nWithin a couple of decades of the collapse of Ronan Point, the public's lack of confidence in the LPS construction technique, together with the social problems within such developments, led to the demolition of many [[tower block]]s.<ref name=modernity/>  Despite this, many buildings like Ronan Point are still standing; there are at least 1,585 of them and 200 towers with 20 storeys or higher{{when|date=April 2020}}.  There are concerns that problems might emerge as the buildings weaken with age.  Wind, heat and rain affect buildings. Metal bolts expand when they rust and crack the concrete round them.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-44498608|title=Ronan Point: a fifty-year building safety problem|publisher=[[BBC News]]|date=15 June 2018|accessdate=2 April 2020}}</ref>  In 2018, it was reported that two tower blocks on the [[Broadwater Farm]] estate in [[Tottenham]], Tangmere House and Northholt House, are structurally unsound and could collapse catastrophically if there is a gas explosion or if a vehicle collides with the base.  Both are to be evacuated urgently.  Other buildings in Broadwater Farm also have less serious problems.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/jun/20/two-tottenham-tower-blocks-at-risk-of-catastrophic-collapse|title=Two Tottenham housing blocks at risk of catastrophic collapse|work=[[The Guardian]]|date=20 June 2018|accessdate=2 April 2020}}</ref>\n\n==Legacy==\n\nIn May 2018, 50 years after the partial collapse, Ronan Point was the subject of an experimental documentary film, ''\u2018And then we heard shouts and cries\u2019'' by artist Ricky Chambers.

[[tower block]] in Canning Town in [[London Borough of Newham|Newham]], East London, which partly collapsed on 16 May 1968, only two months after it had opened. A gas explosion blew out some load-bearing walls, causing the collapse of one entire corner of the building, which killed four people and injured 17. The spectacular nature of the failure (caused by both poor design and poor construction), led to a loss of public confidence in high-rise residential buildings, and major changes in UK building regulations resulted.\n\n==Construction==\nRonan Point, named after Deputy Mayor Harry Ronan (a former Chairman of the Housing Committee of the London Borough of Newham), was part of the wave of tower blocks built in the 1960s as cheap, affordable [[Prefabricated building|prefabricated housing]] for inhabitants of [[West Ham]] and other areas of London. The tower was built by [[Taylor Woodrow|Taylor Woodrow Anglian]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/may/16/newsid_2514000/2514277.stm|title=\t\n1968: Three die as tower block collapses|publisher=BBC|accessdate=16 June 2016}}</ref> using a technique known as [[Plattenbau|large panel system building]] (LPS), which involves casting large concrete prefabricated sections off-site and bolting them together to construct the building.

It is believed that the weaknesses were in the joints connecting the vertical walls to the floor slabs. The flank walls fell away, leaving the floors above unsupported and causing the [[progressive collapse]] of the south-east corner of the building.<ref>https://www.logic4training.co.uk/blog/safety/on-this-day-in-1968/</ref>\n\nThe building had just opened, and three of the four flats immediately above Hodge's were unoccupied. Four of the 260 residents were killed immediately and seventeen were injured, including a young mother who was stranded on a narrow ledge when the rest of her living room disappeared. Hodge survived, despite being blown across the room by the explosion \u2014 as was her gas stove, which she took to her new address.<ref name=Collapse/>\n\n==Griffiths inquiry==\n{{anchor|Other defects}}<!-- left in case anything #links here -- but Griffiths inquiry now is the target of one link-->\nIn the immediate aftermath of the collapse, the government commissioned an inquiry, led by [[Hugh Griffiths, Baron Griffiths|Hugh Griffiths]], [[Queen's Counsel|QC]].

However, public confidence in the safety of residential tower blocks was irreparably shaken,<ref name=modernity>{{cite web |url= http://www.open.edu/openlearn/history-the-arts/history/heritage/ronan-point |title= Ronan Point |accessdate=31 October 2014}}</ref> and the public scepticism was later found to be appropriate.<ref name=forensic/>\n\nSome people, including [[Sam Webb (architect)|Sam Webb]], an architect who had given evidence to the Griffiths inquiry, were not satisfied that every issue had been properly investigated. It was later shown that:\n*the assumptions made in determining the revised wind loading were inadequate, in that they assumed all windows were closed. However, if the glass in a window had broken, or somebody had gone out leaving a window open, a wall panel could suffer pressure on one side and suction on the other, to an extent that the panels on the upper levels of the building might still be sucked out\n*construction defects (failure to build as designed) had left unfilled gaps between floors and walls throughout, hidden only by skirting boards and ceiling paper, which left the building without fire separation (or acoustic separation) between flats. Tall blocks of flats in the UK are permitted relatively narrow staircases because the requirement for full fire separation between floors means that in theory, it is safer for people above the fire to stay in their flats rather than walk down the stairs. (This theory does not hold where the fire separation fails, as happened in the [[Grenfell Tower fire]]). Without fire separation it would be necessary for all people above a fire to escape, which would not be possible using the existing narrow staircases.\n*further construction defects had led to the whole weight supported by each wall panel being supported by the panel beneath by two steel rods, instead of being spread evenly along the panel, leading to extremely high stresses that the concrete was not designed to withstand\n*the strengthening brackets which had been fitted during the rebuilding were in many cases not properly attached, since they were fastened to hollow-core slabs, and in many cases they had been bolted only to the thin concrete surrounding the cores, which was inadequate to take the stress.<ref name=forensic/>\n\nThe concern, most particularly about the fire separation issue, eventually led the council to evacuate the building, and then to [[demolition|demolish]] it in 1986 in a forensic manner (rather than, for example, using explosives). When this was done, the extent of the defects found shocked even some of the activists, such as the architect Sam Webb, who had been lobbying for years that the building was unsafe. On the lower floors, cracks were found in the concrete where it had been point loaded, and it was alleged that the extra pressure on those points during a high wind (such as during the [[Great Storm of 1987]], barely a year after the demolition) would soon have led to building collapse.<ref name=forensic/>\n\n==Effect on legislation==\nThe partial collapse of Ronan Point led to major changes in building regulations. The first of these came with the 5th Amendment to the [[building regulations in the United Kingdom|Building Regulations]] in 1970. These are now embodied in Part A of the Building Regulations and cover \u201cDisproportionate Collapse\u201d. They require that \u201cthe building shall be constructed so that in the event of an accident the building will not suffer collapse to an extent disproportionate to the cause\u201d. They specifically cover pressures which may be caused for example by wind forces, explosions (either internal or external), or vehicle incursions, and note that seismic design may occasionally be required.<ref>{{cite web |title= Approved Document A - Structure (2004 Edition incorporating 2010 and 2013 amendments) |work= The Building Regulations 2010 |publisher= HM Government |date= September 2013|edition=reprint |url= http://www.planningportal.gov.uk/uploads/br/BR_PDF_AD_A_2013.pdf |accessdate= 3 March 2014}}</ref>\n\nImmediately after the publication of the report the Government brought out interim measures to ensure the safety and integrity of buildings in the event of an explosion. All new buildings of over five storeys constructed after November 1968 were required to be able to resist an explosive force of {{convert|34|kPa|abbr=on|lk=on}}\u2014that value still being relevant in 2014. Existing buildings were allowed to resist an explosive force of {{convert|17|kPa|abbr=on}}, provided that the gas supply was removed and flats were refitted for electric cooking and heating. The gas supply was removed from Ronan Point and the other eight blocks on the estate.\n\nIt has been said that the location of the explosion, on the fifth floor from the top of the building, was critical to the collapse. If it had been much higher, the lesser momentum of the debris falling onto the floor of the explosion flat would not have caused its collapse, even though it might have sustained some damage, and the progressive collapse of the floors beneath would therefore not have occurred. If it had been much lower, the friction of the joints, under the great weight of the building above, would have prevented the wall panels from blowing out, and there would have been no structural damage at all. {{Citation needed|date=June 2017}} <!-- The open.edu article seems to say the opposite, but I am not sure. --Mopskatze --> The reason that an explosion lower down the block would not have affected the load walls is that the combined mass of all the load above it creates force downwards due to gravity that would have required far greater lateral forces to create catastrophic structural failure and there are specific equilibrium equations used by civil engineers to calculate such forces. The principle layman explanation is this: the lateral force required to blow out the upper floor walls is in linear proportion to the vertical load above multiplied by the lateral frictional resistance, and [[Mohr's circle]] calculations bear this out. \n\nThis may also be why no other such collapse had occurred worldwide at the time. Nonetheless, it demonstrated an area of design which had not previously been considered. Many other jurisdictions, including the US, have since amended their building codes to require that buildings subject to explosions or other accidents will not collapse to an extent disproportionate to the cause.<ref name=forensic/>\n\nTwo days after the Grenfell Tower fire in 2017, John Knapton, emeritus professor of structural engineering at [[Newcastle University]], claimed that regulations which came into force in 1971, following lessons learned from Ronan Point, had improved building structural strength in such a way as to prevent the collapse of the Grenfell Tower, which was built in 1974.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2017/06/14/grenfell-tower-would-have-collapsed-built-four-years-earlier/|title=Grenfell Tower would have collapsed if built four years earlier, says expert|work=Daily Telegraph|date=14 June 2017|accessdate=16 June 2017}}</ref>\n\n==Effect on housing==\nNewham Council voted in 1984 to demolish Ronan Point. All nine blocks on the Freemason Estate, comprising 990 flats, were demolished in 1986 and the area was redeveloped with two-storey houses with gardens.<ref name=modernity/> Many other similar LPS buildings have since been demolished.\n\nThe [[Building Research Establishment]] published a series of reports in the 1980s to advise local councils and building owners on checking the structural stability of their LPS blocks. The contents of two of the reports relied on local authorities sending returns in to the [[Ministry of Housing and Local Government]] during 1968 and 1969. This was not exhaustive, with many authorities failing to do so and thus not having their blocks assessed after the issue of interim structural methods by the Ministry in 1968\u201369. Among these authorities were [[London Borough of Lambeth|Lambeth]] and [[London Borough of Southwark|Southwark]] in London, and [[Birmingham City Council|Birmingham]]. Birmingham owned over 300 LPS blocks, and when these were assessed in 1998 it was found that a number which did not meet 5 psi (34&nbsp;kN/m\u00b2) still had a piped gas supply. A number of those blocks were demolished. The London Borough of Southwark owns the largest LPS estate in the UK, the [[Aylesbury Estate]], which has a piped gas supply; it has been questioned{{by whom?|date=November 2016}} whether the structure is strong enough to resist a 5 psi explosion. Southwark Council admitted in 2017 that strengthening work ordered after Ronan Point may not have been carried out on the [[Ledbury Estate]], after structural weaknesses were found that led to the evacuation of four tower blocks.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-london-40891474|title=South London estate to be evacuated over safety fears - BBC News|work=[[BBC Online]]|accessdate=10 August 2017}}</ref>\n\nWithin a couple of decades of the collapse of Ronan Point, the public's lack of confidence in the LPS construction technique, together with the social problems within such developments, led to the demolition of many [[tower block]]s.<ref name=modernity/>  Despite this, many buildings like Ronan Point are still standing; there are at least 1,585 of them and 200 towers with 20 storeys or higher{{when|date=April 2020}}.

Other buildings in Broadwater Farm also have less serious problems.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/jun/20/two-tottenham-tower-blocks-at-risk-of-catastrophic-collapse|title=Two Tottenham housing blocks at risk of catastrophic collapse|work=[[The Guardian]]|date=20 June 2018|accessdate=2 April 2020}}</ref>\n\n==Legacy==\n\nIn May 2018, 50 years after the partial collapse, Ronan Point was the subject of an experimental documentary film, ''\u2018And then we heard shouts and cries\u2019'' by artist Ricky Chambers.

It was written by [[Max Martin]] and produced by Martin and [[Rami Yacoub|Rami]]. After recording and sending a demo tape with an unused song from [[Toni Braxton]], Spears signed a multi-album deal with Jive. \"...Baby One More Time\" is a pop song that refers to a girl's feelings after a break-up with her boyfriend.\n\n\"...Baby One More Time\" was released on October 23, 1998 through [[Jive Records]]. It reached number one in at least 18 countries, including the United Kingdom, where it earned triple-platinum certification from the [[British Phonographic Industry]] (BPI) and became the country's best-selling song of 1999. The song is one of the [[List of best-selling singles|best-selling singles of all time]], with over 10 million copies sold. An accompanying [[music video]], directed by [[Nigel Dick]], portrays Spears as a student from a Catholic high school, who starts to [[daydream]] that she is singing and dancing around the school, while watching her love interest from afar. The music video was later referenced in the music video of \"[[If U Seek Amy]]\" (2009), where Spears's fictional daughter is dressed with a similar schoolgirl outfit while wearing pink ribbons in her hair. In 2010, the music video for \"...Baby One More Time\" was voted the third most influential video in the history of [[pop music]], in a poll held by [[Jam!]]. In 2011, \"...Baby One More Time\" was voted by ''Billboard'' to be the best music video of the 1990s. It has been featured on all of her greatest hits and other compilation albums.\n\nSpears has performed \"...Baby One More Time\" in a number of live appearances and during all of her concert tours. It was the encore of the [[...Baby One More Time Tour]] (1999) and [[Dream Within a Dream Tour]] (2001\u201302); Spears also performed remixed versions of the song during the [[Oops!... I Did It Again Tour]] (2000\u201301), [[The Onyx Hotel Tour]] (2004), [[The M+M's Tour]] (2007), [[The Circus Starring Britney Spears]] (2009), the [[Femme Fatale Tour]] (2011), and her [[concert residency]] [[Britney: Piece of Me]] (2013\u201317). \"...Baby One More Time\" was nominated for a [[Grammy Award]] for [[Grammy Award for Best Female Pop Vocal Performance|Best Female Pop Vocal Performance]] at the [[42nd Annual Grammy Awards]] (2000), and has been included in lists by ''[[Blender (magazine)|Blender]]'', ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' and [[VH1]]. It has been noted for redefining the sound of [[1990s music|late 1990s music]]. Spears has named \"...Baby One More Time\" as one of her favorite songs from her career. It was also the final song to be played on the [[BBC]]'s music programme ''[[Top of the Pops]]'' in the 1990s. It is also featured in the 2011 dance video game by [[Ubisoft]], ''[[Just Dance 3]]''.

It was written by [[Max Martin]] and produced by Martin and [[Rami Yacoub|Rami]]. After recording and sending a demo tape with an unused song from [[Toni Braxton]], Spears signed a multi-album deal with Jive. \"...Baby One More Time\" is a pop song that refers to a girl's feelings after a break-up with her boyfriend.\n\n\"...Baby One More Time\" was released on October 23, 1998 through [[Jive Records]]. It reached number one in at least 18 countries, including the United Kingdom, where it earned triple-platinum certification from the [[British Phonographic Industry]] (BPI) and became the country's best-selling song of 1999. The song is one of the [[List of best-selling singles|best-selling singles of all time]], with over 10 million copies sold. An accompanying [[music video]], directed by [[Nigel Dick]], portrays Spears as a student from a Catholic high school, who starts to [[daydream]] that she is singing and dancing around the school, while watching her love interest from afar. The music video was later referenced in the music video of \"[[If U Seek Amy]]\" (2009), where Spears's fictional daughter is dressed with a similar schoolgirl outfit while wearing pink ribbons in her hair. In 2010, the music video for \"...Baby One More Time\" was voted the third most influential video in the history of [[pop music]], in a poll held by [[Jam!]]. In 2011, \"...Baby One More Time\" was voted by ''Billboard'' to be the best music video of the 1990s. It has been featured on all of her greatest hits and other compilation albums.\n\nSpears has performed \"...Baby One More Time\" in a number of live appearances and during all of her concert tours. It was the encore of the [[...Baby One More Time Tour]] (1999) and [[Dream Within a Dream Tour]] (2001\u201302); Spears also performed remixed versions of the song during the [[Oops!... I Did It Again Tour]] (2000\u201301), [[The Onyx Hotel Tour]] (2004), [[The M+M's Tour]] (2007), [[The Circus Starring Britney Spears]] (2009), the [[Femme Fatale Tour]] (2011), and her [[concert residency]] [[Britney: Piece of Me]] (2013\u201317). \"...Baby One More Time\" was nominated for a [[Grammy Award]] for [[Grammy Award for Best Female Pop Vocal Performance|Best Female Pop Vocal Performance]] at the [[42nd Annual Grammy Awards]] (2000), and has been included in lists by ''[[Blender (magazine)|Blender]]'', ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' and [[VH1]]. It has been noted for redefining the sound of [[1990s music|late 1990s music]]. Spears has named \"...Baby One More Time\" as one of her favorite songs from her career. It was also the final song to be played on the [[BBC]]'s music programme ''[[Top of the Pops]]'' in the 1990s. It is also featured in the 2011 dance video game by [[Ubisoft]], ''[[Just Dance 3]]''. In 2018, readers of German teen magazine [[Bravo (magazine)|''Bravo'' magazine]] voted \"...Baby One More Time\" to be the biggest hit since its first music compilation was released in 1992.\n\n==Background==\n{| cellpadding=\"5\"  style=\"width:30%; float:right; border-collapse:collapse; background:none; border-style:none;\"\n|-\n|  style=\"width:20px; vertical-align:top;\"| [[File:cquote1.png|10px|link=]]\n| style=\"text-align:left;\"|\nI had been in studio for about six months listening and recording material, but I hadn't really heard a hit yet.
