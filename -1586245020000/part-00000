The song was released in Australia by [[Parlophone]] as the [[Single (music)|lead single]] from the album on 8 September 2001. It was released on 17 September 2001 in the United Kingdom. In the United States, the single was released on 18 February 2002. Jointly written, composed, and produced by [[Cathy Dennis]] and [[Rob Davis (musician)|Rob Davis]], \"Can't Get You Out of My Head\" is a [[midtempo]] [[dance-pop]], [[synth-pop]], [[techno-pop]] and [[nu-disco]], which lyrically details the singer's [[Obsessive love|obsession]] towards her lover. The song is famous for its \"la la la\" hook.\n\nIn addition to acclaim from music critics, \"Can't Get You Out of My Head\" found commercial success on a large scale. It peaked at number one on the [[Record chart|charts]] of Austria, Belgium, France, Germany, Italy, Poland, Switzerland, the United Kingdom, and every other European country excluding Finland. It also topped the charts of Minogue's native Australia as well as New Zealand. In the United States, the song peaked at number seven on the US [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] chart, becoming Minogue's biggest hit in the region since \"[[The Loco-Motion (Kylie Minogue song)|The Loco-Motion]]\". \"Can't Get You Out of My Head\" reportedly reached number one in 40 countries across the globe. It was [[Record certification|certified]] triple-platinum in Australia, double-platinum in the United Kingdom, and gold in the United States. It became Minogue's first single to sell in excess of [[List of million-selling singles in the United Kingdom|one million copies]] in the United Kingdom, where it also stands as the 28th best-selling single of the millennium. As of 2013, the song was Minogue's highest selling single and one of the [[Best-selling singles worldwide|best-selling singles of all time]], with worldwide sales exceeding five million.\n\nThe accompanying music video for the song was directed by [[Dawn Shadforth]], and featured Minogue performing various dance routines in different futuristic backdrops. It became notable for the revealing hooded white jumpsuit Minogue wore during one of the scenes. The song has been performed by Minogue during all of her [[List of Kylie Minogue concert tours|concert tours]] as of 2019, with the exception of the [[Anti Tour]]. Following its release, \"Can't Get You Out of My Head\" ranked on a number of decade-end lists compiled by magazines such as ''[[Rolling Stone]],'' ''[[The Guardian]],'' and ''[[NME]].'' It is considered to be Minogue's strongest commercial breakthrough in the United States and is said to have been the reason behind the success of its parent album ''Fever'' in the region. \"Can't Get You Out of My Head\" is also recognized as Minogue's [[signature song]] and was a defining point in her musical career. In 2012, the song was re-recorded for inclusion in Minogue's orchestral compilation album, ''[[The Abbey Road Sessions (Kylie Minogue album)|The Abbey Road Sessions]].''\n\n==Background and recording==\nIn 2000, Minogue signed to the [[Parlophone]] Records label and released her seventh studio album, ''[[Light Years (Kylie Minogue album)|Light Years]].''<ref name=kyliebioallmusic>{{cite web|last=True|first=Chris|title=Kylie Minogue \u2013 Biography|url=http://www.allmusic.com/artist/kylie-minogue-mn0000776093/biography|publisher=Allmusic.

The song was released in Australia by [[Parlophone]] as the [[Single (music)|lead single]] from the album on 8 September 2001. It was released on 17 September 2001 in the United Kingdom. In the United States, the single was released on 18 February 2002. Jointly written, composed, and produced by [[Cathy Dennis]] and [[Rob Davis (musician)|Rob Davis]], \"Can't Get You Out of My Head\" is a [[midtempo]] [[dance-pop]], [[synth-pop]], [[techno-pop]] and [[nu-disco]], which lyrically details the singer's [[Obsessive love|obsession]] towards her lover. The song is famous for its \"la la la\" hook.\n\nIn addition to acclaim from music critics, \"Can't Get You Out of My Head\" found commercial success on a large scale. It peaked at number one on the [[Record chart|charts]] of Austria, Belgium, France, Germany, Italy, Poland, Switzerland, the United Kingdom, and every other European country excluding Finland. It also topped the charts of Minogue's native Australia as well as New Zealand. In the United States, the song peaked at number seven on the US [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] chart, becoming Minogue's biggest hit in the region since \"[[The Loco-Motion (Kylie Minogue song)|The Loco-Motion]]\". \"Can't Get You Out of My Head\" reportedly reached number one in 40 countries across the globe. It was [[Record certification|certified]] triple-platinum in Australia, double-platinum in the United Kingdom, and gold in the United States. It became Minogue's first single to sell in excess of [[List of million-selling singles in the United Kingdom|one million copies]] in the United Kingdom, where it also stands as the 28th best-selling single of the millennium. As of 2013, the song was Minogue's highest selling single and one of the [[Best-selling singles worldwide|best-selling singles of all time]], with worldwide sales exceeding five million.\n\nThe accompanying music video for the song was directed by [[Dawn Shadforth]], and featured Minogue performing various dance routines in different futuristic backdrops. It became notable for the revealing hooded white jumpsuit Minogue wore during one of the scenes. The song has been performed by Minogue during all of her [[List of Kylie Minogue concert tours|concert tours]] as of 2019, with the exception of the [[Anti Tour]]. Following its release, \"Can't Get You Out of My Head\" ranked on a number of decade-end lists compiled by magazines such as ''[[Rolling Stone]],'' ''[[The Guardian]],'' and ''[[NME]].'' It is considered to be Minogue's strongest commercial breakthrough in the United States and is said to have been the reason behind the success of its parent album ''Fever'' in the region. \"Can't Get You Out of My Head\" is also recognized as Minogue's [[signature song]] and was a defining point in her musical career. In 2012, the song was re-recorded for inclusion in Minogue's orchestral compilation album, ''[[The Abbey Road Sessions (Kylie Minogue album)|The Abbey Road Sessions]].''\n\n==Background and recording==\nIn 2000, Minogue signed to the [[Parlophone]] Records label and released her seventh studio album, ''[[Light Years (Kylie Minogue album)|Light Years]].''<ref name=kyliebioallmusic>{{cite web|last=True|first=Chris|title=Kylie Minogue \u2013 Biography|url=http://www.allmusic.com/artist/kylie-minogue-mn0000776093/biography|publisher=Allmusic.

uncomplicated, catchily repetitive beats and synth-sound, marked yet another clearly defined image transformation from the camp-infused ''Light Years'' to an emphasis upon a cool, machine-like sexuality, a trait clearly identifiable within the promotional video for \u2019Can\u2019t Get You Out of My Head.\u2019\"<ref name=legacyleebarronjournal /> Similarly, Everett True from ''The Guardian'' wrote that the song continued the \"change in the marketing and public perception of Kylie\" and her transition from the \"homely [[Girl next door|girl-next-door]]\" to \"a much more flirtatious, sophisticated persona\" that started with the release of \"Spinning Around\" in 2000.<ref name=legacyguardiantrue /> True also felt that the success of \"Can't Get You Out of My Head\" was one of the motivating factors behind \"manufactured\" pop music gaining a \"new postmodern respectability\" and marked a \"clear shift in attitude towards pop music among the 'serious' rock critic fraternity: the idea that (manufactured, female) pop music might well be the equal of (organic, male) rock music after all, that each has their high points and their low.\"<ref name=legacyguardiantrue

Ruse had a career-high [[International Tennis Federation|ITF]] juniors ranking of 7, achieved on 18 May 2015. She made the semifinals of the [[2014 Wimbledon Championships \u2013 Girls' Singles|2014 Wimbledon]] girls' singles event.\n\nRuse made her [[WTA Tour]] main-draw debut at the [[2015 BRD Bucharest Open]] in the doubles event, partnering [[Jaqueline Cristian]].\n\n==Tennis career==\n===2012\u20132015: Junior career===\nRuse won two singles titles and eight doubles titles on the ITF junior circuit. The biggest title of her junior career was the grade-1 Canadian Open Junior Championships, where she beat [[Katie Swan]] in the final. Ruse also reached the semifinals of Junior Wimbledon in 2014 and the final of Eddie Herr.\n\n===2015\u20132016: Rise up the professional ranks===\nWhen Ruse finished her junior career, she still did not have a professional ranking. In July 2015, she received a wildcard into the qualifying draw of the [[2015 BRD Bucharest Open]] and beat [[Alexandra Cadantu]] in the first round. She lost her next match to [[Maria Sakkari]]. She reached semifinals at $10k events in Bucharest and Antalya and finished 2015 with a year-end ranking of 642 in singles and 575 in doubles.\n\nIn November 2015, Ruse won her first professional singles title at a $10k event in Antalya, beating [[Ekaterine Gorgodze]] in the final. In January 2016, Ruse qualified for the $25k event in Sunrise, beating former top-30 player [[Laura Robson]] along the way, and reached the quarterfinals. After that event, she won ten singles matches and eight doubles matches in a row and won two singles and two doubles titles at $10k events in Antalya. In March, Ruse reached two straight finals at $10k events in [[Hammamet, Tunisia]]. She lost the first one to [[Claudia Giovine]] in straight sets, snapping her 14-match winning streak in singles, and in the second one she beat [[Julia Grabher]]. At the end of April, Ruse qualified for a $25k event in [[Chiasso]], Switzerland and reached the semifinals, where she lost to fellow qualifier [[Amanda Carreras]].\n\nAfter taking time off for her high school graduation, Ruse returned to competition in June at a $50k event in Essen, Germany. As the last direct acceptance, Ruse shocked top seed [[Aliaksandra Sasnovich]] in three sets for her first win over a top-100 player. Due to rain delays in Essen, Ruse had to play her second-round match the same day and lost in straight sets to Spanish qualifier [[Olga S\u00e1ez Larra]].\n\n==Grand Slam singles performance timeline==\n{{Performance key}}\n{|class=wikitable style=text-align:center\n|-\n!Tournament!![[2018 WTA Tour|2018]]!![[2019 WTA Tour|2019]]!![[2020 WTA Tour|2020]]!!W\u2013L\n|-\n|align=left| [[Australian Open]]\n|A\n|A\n|[[2020 Australian Open \u2013 Women's Singles Qualifying|Q3]]\n|0\u20130\n|-\n|align=left| [[French Open]]\n|A\n|A\n|\n|0\u20130\n|-\n|align=left| [[Wimbledon Championships|Wimbledon]]\n|bgcolor=afeeee|[[2018 Wimbledon Championships \u2013 Women's Singles|1R]]\n|bgcolor=afeeee|[[2019 Wimbledon Championships \u2013 Women's Singles|1R]]\n|\n|0\u20132\n|-\n|align=left| [[US Open (tennis)|US Open]]\n|[[2018 US Open \u2013 Women's Singles Qualifying|Q1]]\n|[[2019 US Open \u2013 Women's Singles Qualifying|Q3]]\n|\n|0\u20130\n|-\n!style=text-align:left|Win\u2013Loss\n!0\u20131\n!0\u20131\n!0\u20130\n!0\u20132\n|-\n|}\n\n==WTA career finals==\n===Doubles: 1 (1 runner-up)===\n{|\n|-valign=top\n|\n\n{|class=wikitable\n!Winner \u2013 Legend\n|-\n|bgcolor=f3e6d7|Grand Slam tournaments (0\u20130)\n|-\n|bgcolor=FFFF99|WTA Tour Championships (0\u20130)\n|-\n|bgcolor=e9e9e9|Premier Mandatory & Premier 5 (0\u20130)\n|-\n|bgcolor=d4f1c5|Premier (0\u20130)\n|-\n|International (0\u20131)\n|}\n|\n{|class=wikitable\n!Finals by surface\n|-\n|Hard (0\u20130)\n|-\n|Grass (0\u20130)\n|-\n|Clay (0\u20131)\n|-\n|Carpet (0\u20130)\n|}\n|}\n\n{|class=\"sortable wikitable\"\n|-\n!Result\n!class=\"unsortable\"|W\u2013L\n!Date\n!Tournament\n!Tier\n!Surface\n!Partner\n!Opponents\n!class=\"unsortable\"|Score\n|-\n|style=\"background:#ffa07a;\"|Loss\n|<small>0\u20131</small>\n|[[2019 Bucharest Open \u2013 Doubles|{{dts|Jul 2019}}]]\n|[[Bucharest Open]], Romania\n|International\n|Clay\n|{{flagicon|ROU}} [[Jaqueline Cristian]]\n|{{flagicon|SVK}} [[Vikt\u00f3ria Ku\u017emov\u00e1]] <br/> {{flagicon|CZE}} [[Krist\u00fdna Pl\u00ed\u0161kov\u00e1]]\n|4\u20136, 6\u20137<sup>(3\u20137)</sup>\n|}\n\n==ITF Circuit finals==\n===Singles: 9 (6 titles, 3 runner\u2013ups)===\n{|\n|-valign=top\n|\n{|class=wikitable\n!

2018. Ruse had a career-high [[International Tennis Federation|ITF]] juniors ranking of 7, achieved on 18 May 2015. She made the semifinals of the [[2014 Wimbledon Championships \u2013 Girls' Singles|2014 Wimbledon girls' singles]] event.\n\nRuse made her WTA main-draw debut at the [[2015 BRD Bucharest Open]] in the doubles event partnering [[Jaqueline Cristian]].\n\n==Tennis career==\n===2012\u20132015: Junior career===\nRuse won two junior singles titles and eight junior doubles titles. The biggest title of her junior career was the Grade 1 Canadian Open Junior Championships, where she beat [[Katie Swan]] in the final. Ruse also reached the semifinals of Junior Wimbledon in 2014 and the final of Eddie Herr.\n\n===2015\u20132016: Rise up the professional ranks===\nWhen Ruse finished her junior career, she still did not have a professional ranking. In July 2015, she received a wildcard into the qualifying draw of the [[2015 BRD Bucharest Open]] and beat [[Alexandra Cadantu]] in the first round. She lost her next match to [[Maria Sakkari]]. She reached semifinals at $10,000 ITF events in Bucharest and Antalya and finished 2015 with a year-end ranking of 642 in singles and 575 in doubles.\n\nIn November 2015, Ruse won her first professional singles title at a $10k event in Antalya, beating [[Ekaterine Gorgodze]] in the final. In January 2016, Ruse qualified for the $25k event in Sunrise, beating former top-30 player [[Laura Robson]] along the way, and reached the quarterfinals. After that event, she won 10 singles matches and 8 doubles matches in a row and won two singles and two doubles titles at $10,000 events in Antalya. In March, Ruse reached two straight finals at $10k events in [[Hammamet, Tunisia]]. She lost the first one to [[Claudia Giovine]] in straight sets, snapping her 14-match winning streak in singles, and in the second one she beat [[Julia Grabher]]. At the end of April, Ruse qualified for a $25k event in [[Chiasso]], Switzerland and reached the semifinals, where she lost to fellow qualifier [[Amanda Carreras]].\n\nAfter taking time off for her high school graduation, Ruse returned to competition in June at a $50k event in Essen, Germany. As the last direct acceptance, Ruse shocked top seed [[Aliaksandra Sasnovich]] in three sets for her first win over a top-100 player. Due to rain delays in Essen, Ruse had to play her second-round match the same day and lost in straight sets to Spanish qualifier [[Olga S\u00e1ez Larra]].\n\n==Performance timeline==\n{{Performance key}}\n===Singles===\n\n{|class=wikitable style=text-align:center\n|-\n!Tournament!![[2018 WTA Tour|2018]]!![[2019 WTA Tour|2019]]!![[2020 WTA Tour|2020]]!!W\u2013L!!Win %\n|-\n| colspan=\"6\" style=\"text-align:left;\" |'''Grand Slam tournaments'''\n|-\n|align=left|[[Australian Open]]\n|A\n|A\n|[[2020 Australian Open \u2013 Women's Singles Qualifying|Q3]]\n|0\u20130\n|{{tennis win percentage|won=0|lost=0}}\n|-\n|align=left|[[French Open]]\n|A\n|A\n|\n|0\u20130\n|{{tennis win percentage|won=0|lost=0}}\n|-\n|align=left|[[Wimbledon Championships|Wimbledon]]\n|bgcolor=afeeee|[[2018 Wimbledon Championships \u2013 Women's Singles|1R]]\n|bgcolor=afeeee|[[2019 Wimbledon Championships \u2013 Women's Singles|1R]]\n|style=\"color:#ccc;\"|NH\n|0\u20132\n|{{tennis win percentage|won=0|lost=2}}\n|-\n|align=left|[[US Open (tennis)|US Open]]\n|[[2018 US Open \u2013 Women's Singles Qualifying|Q1]]\n|[[2019 US Open \u2013 Women's Singles Qualifying|Q3]]\n|\n|0\u20130\n|{{tennis win percentage|won=0|lost=0}}\n|-style=\"background:#efefef; font-weight:bold;\"\n| style=\"text-align:left\" |Win\u2013Loss\n|0\u20131\n|0\u20131\n|0\u20130\n|0\u20132\n|{{tennis win percentage|won=0|lost=2}}\n|-\n|}\n\n==WTA career finals==\n===Doubles: 1 (1 runner-up)===\n{|\n|-valign=top\n|\n\n{|class=wikitable\n!Winner \u2013 Legend\n|-\n|bgcolor=f3e6d7|Grand Slam tournaments (0\u20130)\n|-\n|bgcolor=FFFF99|WTA Tour Championships (0\u20130)\n|-\n|bgcolor=e9e9e9|Premier Mandatory & Premier 5 (0\u20130)\n|-\n|bgcolor=d4f1c5|Premier (0\u20130)\n|-\n|International (0\u20131)\n|}\n|\n{|class=wikitable\n!Finals by surface\n|-\n|Hard (0\u20130)\n|-\n|Grass (0\u20130)\n|-\n|Clay (0\u20131)\n|-\n|Carpet (0\u20130)\n|}\n|}\n\n{|class=\"sortable wikitable\" \n|-\n!Result\n!class=\"unsortable\"|W\u2013L\n!Date\n!Tournament\n!Tier\n!Surface\n!Partner\n!Opponents\n!class=\"unsortable\"|Score\n|-\n|style=\"background:#ffa07a;\"|Loss\n|<small>0\u20131</small>\n|[[2019 Bucharest Open \u2013 Doubles|{{dts|Jul 2019}}]]\n|[[Bucharest Open]], Romania\n|International\n|Clay\n|{{flagicon|ROU}} [[Jaqueline Cristian]]\n|{{flagicon|SVK}} [[Vikt\u00f3ria Ku\u017emov\u00e1]] <br/> {{flagicon|CZE}} [[Krist\u00fdna Pl\u00ed\u0161kov\u00e1]]\n|4\u20136, 6\u20137<sup>(3\u20137)</sup>\n|}\n\n==ITF Circuit finals==\n===Singles: 9 (6 titles, 3 runner\u2013ups)===\n{|\n|-valign=top\n|\n{|class=wikitable \n!

The Loyola Heights segment of [[Circumferential Road 5]], in [[Quezon City]]. It traverses the Marikina Valley and passes through [[Antipolo]], where it intersects the [[Sumulong Highway]] (at Masinag). After Masinag the road starts its ascent towards the [[Sierra Madre (Philippines)|Sierra Madre]] passing through [[Tanay, Rizal]], [[Santa Maria, Laguna]], finally to [[Infanta, Quezon]].\n\n==Route description==\n===Greater Manila Area Segment (Until Rizal Province, Sta. Maria, Laguna to Infanta, Quezon)=== \n\nThe Marcos highway starts as a physical continuation of Aurora Boulevard under Katipunan Flyover. The highway slightly curves at the intersection with Andres Bonifacio Avenue connecting the Marikina city proper, then crosses the [[Marikina River]]. The Diosdado B. Macapagal Bridge that connects with [[Circumferential Road 5|C-5]] merges in front of [[SM City Marikina]]. The [[Manila Light Rail Transit System Line 2|Manila Line 2]] and the Cainta - Marikina subtransmission line of [[Meralco]] parallel the highway. The highway makes another slight curve at  the approach to Cainta. It soon runs over the Cainta-Marikina boundary, and then goes straight towards the Cainta-Antipolo boundary towards the Masinag Junction with [[Sumulong Highway]] wherein it continues on to Cogeo towards the rest of the [[Rizal Province]], [[Sta. Maria, Laguna]] to [[Infanta, Quezon]]\n\nThis highway, also commonly called '''Marcos Highway''' is a divided road featuring U-turn slots, and bike lanes. Several establishments, like the [[Riverbanks Center]], [[SM City Marikina]], [[Ayala Malls Feliz]], [[Robinsons Metro East]], [[Sta. Lucia East Grand Mall]], and [[SM City Masinag]] are primary landmarks accessible through the road. Meralco subtransmission lines line the Cainta-Masinag segment of the highway up to [[Santa Maria, Laguna]] until the [[Infanta, Quezon]] Junction\n\n===Rizal-Laguna-Quezon Segment===\nThis stretch of the highway is a standard 2-6 lane road divided by lane markings typical of national highways located in the provinces. Road size varies depending on the density of the location as well as the engineering district wherein numerous road widening may occur as determined by the DPWH. The road ends and merges with Famy\u2013Real\u2013Infanta Road (Route 601).\n\n===Route numbers===\nSince 2014 with the implementation of the new route numbering system by the [[Department of Public Works and Highways]] (DPWH), it is the component of '''National Route 59''' ('''N59''') of the highway in the [[Philippine highway network]] in the Greater Manila Area. From Rizal to Quezon, the road remains unnumbered and identified as a tertiary national road.\n\n==History==\n{{emdash}} The h\n\nighway existed far back to the American colonial era as '''Highway 55''' which included present-day [[Recto Avenue]], [[Legarda Street]], [[Magsaysay Boulevard]] and [[Aurora Boulevard]].{{cn|date=June 2017}}\n\n==Intersections==\n{{PHLinttop|km_ref=<ref>{{Cite web|title=North Manila|url=http://www.dpwh.gov.ph/dpwh/2016%20DPWH%20Road%20and%20Bridge%20Inventory%20v.2/Road%20Data%202016/north_manila.htm|work=2016 DPWH data|publisher=[[Department of Public Works and Highways (Philippines)|Department of Public Works and Highways]]|accessdate=August 13, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170813151232/http://www.dpwh.gov.ph/dpwh/2016%20DPWH%20Road%20and%20Bridge%20Inventory%20v.2/Road%20Data%202016/north_manila.htm|archive-date=August 13, 2017|url-status=dead}}</ref>}}\n{{PHLint\n|hucicc=Marikina\n|lspan=3\n|km=\n|km2=\n|road={{Jct|country=PHL|N|11|name1=[[Circumferential Road 5|C.P.

It soon runs over the Cainta-Marikina boundary, and then goes straight towards the Cainta-Antipolo boundary towards the Masinag Junction with [[Sumulong Highway]] wherein it continues on to Cogeo towards the rest of the [[Rizal Province]], [[Sta. Maria, Laguna]] to [[Infanta, Quezon]]\n\nThis highway, also commonly called '''Marcos Highway''' is a divided road featuring U-turn slots, and bike lanes. Several establishments, like the [[Riverbanks Center]], [[SM City Marikina]], [[Ayala Malls Feliz]], [[Robinsons Metro East]], [[Sta. Lucia East Grand Mall]], and [[SM City Masinag]] are primary landmarks accessible through the road. Meralco subtransmission lines line the Cainta-Masinag segment of the highway up to [[Santa Maria, Laguna]] until the [[Infanta, Quezon]] Junction\n\n===Rizal-Laguna-Quezon Segment===\nThis stretch of the highway is a standard 2-6 lane road divided by lane markings typical of national highways located in the provinces. Road size varies depending on the density of the location as well as the engineering district wherein numerous road widening may occur as determined by the DPWH. The road ends and merges with Famy\u2013Real\u2013Infanta Road (Route 601).\n\n===Route numbers===\nSince 2014 with the implementation of the new route numbering system by the [[Department of Public Works and Highways]] (DPWH), it is the component of '''National Route 59''' ('''N59''') of the highway in the [[Philippine highway network]] in the Greater Manila Area. From Rizal to Quezon, the road remains unnumbered and identified as a tertiary national road.\n\n==History==\n{{emdash}} The h\n\nhighway existed far back to the American colonial era as '''Highway 55''' which included present-day [[Recto Avenue]], [[Legarda Street]], [[Magsaysay Boulevard]] and [[Aurora Boulevard]].{{cn|date=June 2017}}\n\n==Intersections==\n{{PHLinttop|km_ref=<ref>{{Cite web|title=North Manila|url=http://www.dpwh.gov.ph/dpwh/2016%20DPWH%20Road%20and%20Bridge%20Inventory%20v.2/Road%20Data%202016/north_manila.htm|work=2016 DPWH data|publisher=[[Department of Public Works and Highways (Philippines)|Department of Public Works and Highways]]|accessdate=August 13, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170813151232/http://www.dpwh.gov.ph/dpwh/2016%20DPWH%20Road%20and%20Bridge%20Inventory%20v.2/Road%20Data%202016/north_manila.htm|archive-date=August 13, 2017|url-status=dead}}</ref>}}\n{{PHLint\n|hucicc=Marikina\n|lspan=3\n|km=\n|km2=\n|road={{Jct|country=PHL|N|11|name1=[[Circumferential Road 5|C.P.

He served in the [[Second World War]] and held a number of commands, in addition to earning the [[Distinguished Service Cross (United Kingdom)|Distinguished Service Cross]] for his role in the sinking of the [[German submarine U-1274|German submarine ''U-1274'']] in April 1945 while commanding officer aboard {{HMS|Viceroy|D91|6}}.\n\nAs a first-class cricketer, Manners was a hard-hitting right-handed batsman and a right-arm [[Seam bowling|medium pace bowler]]. He began his playing career with [[Hampshire County Cricket Club|Hampshire]] in 1936, but found his availability limited due to his commitments as a naval officer. With his first-class career further interrupted by the war, Manners returned to first-class cricket in 1947 after securing a shore based position at [[Royal Military Academy Sandhurst|Sandhurst]]. He played [[county cricket]] for Hampshire in 1947 and 1948, but played the majority of his first-class cricket after the war for the [[Combined Services cricket team]]. He scored over 1,000 runs in his first-class career, which included four centuries.\n\nIn September 2018, he became the [[Lists of oldest cricketers#Longest-lived first-class cricketers|longest-lived first-class cricketer]], surpassing the previous record of 103 years and 344 days held by [[Jim Hutchinson]], having been the oldest living first-class cricketer since September 2014.\n\n==Early life==\nThe son of the [[Royal Navy]] admiral and theologian [[Errol Manners|Sir Errol Manners]] (1883&ndash;1953) and his wife, Florence Maud Harrison (1883&ndash;1967), he was born in [[Exeter]] in September 1914.<ref name=\"TIMES\">{{cite news|url=https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/lieutenant-commander-john-manners-obituary-pwm9ntwlb |title=Lieutenant-Commander John Manners obituary |date=2020-03-16 |work=[[The Times]] |accessdate=2020-03-18 |url-access=subscription}}</ref> He was descended from [[John Manners, 2nd Duke of Rutland]].<ref name=\"OBIT\">{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/obituaries/2020/03/09/lieutenant-commander-john-manners-naval-officer-sank-u-boat/ |title=Lieutenant Commander John Manners, naval officer who sank a U-boat and played cricket for Hampshire \u2013 obituary |date=2019-03-09 |work=[[The Daily Telegraph]] |accessdate=2019-03-15 |url-access=subscription}}</ref> He was educated at Ferndown School,<ref name=\"IND\">{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/obituaries/john-manners-death-cricket-royal-navy-second-world-war-a9408856.html |title=John Manners: Naval war hero and world\u2019s oldest former first-class cricketer |first=Kenneth |last=Shenton |date=2020-03-27 |work=[[The Independent]] |accessdate=2020-03-31}}</ref> before attending [[Britannia Royal Naval College]] as a cadet from the age of 13, following in a family tradition of attending the college.<ref name=\"UNIT\"/><ref name=\"ESPN\">{{cite web|url=http://www.espn.co.uk/cricket/story/_/id/24602746/john-manners-former-hampshire-batsman-becomes-oldest-living-first-class-cricketer |title=John Manners, former Hampshire batsman, becomes oldest living first-class cricketer |publisher=ESPNcricinfo |accessdate=2018-09-13}}</ref> His time as a cadet saw him visit the [[British West Indies|West Indies]] and appear for the college in the schools' match at [[Lord's]] in 1930.<ref name=\"OBIT\"/>\n\n==Early naval and cricket career==\nManners was commissioned as a [[midshipman]] in the [[Royal Navy]] in September 1932, before being made an acting-[[sub-lieutenant]] in January 1935.

The son of the admiral [[Errol Manners|Sir Errol Manners]], he had a distinguished naval career which spanned from 1932 to 1958. He served in the [[Second World War]] and held a number of commands, in addition to earning the [[Distinguished Service Cross (United Kingdom)|Distinguished Service Cross]] for his role in the sinking of the [[German submarine U-1274|German submarine ''U-1274'']] in April 1945 while commanding officer aboard {{HMS|Viceroy|D91|6}}.\n\nAs a first-class cricketer, Manners was a hard-hitting right-handed batsman and a right-arm [[Seam bowling|medium pace bowler]]. He began his playing career with [[Hampshire County Cricket Club|Hampshire]] in 1936, but found his availability limited due to his commitments as a naval officer. With his first-class career further interrupted by the war, Manners returned to first-class cricket in 1947 after securing a shore based position at [[Royal Military Academy Sandhurst|Sandhurst]]. He played [[county cricket]] for Hampshire in 1947 and 1948, but played the majority of his first-class cricket after the war for the [[Combined Services cricket team]]. He scored over 1,000 runs in his first-class career, which included four centuries.\n\nIn September 2018, he became the [[Lists of oldest cricketers#Longest-lived first-class cricketers|longest-lived first-class cricketer]], surpassing the previous record of 103 years and 344 days held by [[Jim Hutchinson]], having been the oldest living first-class cricketer since September 2014.\n\n==Early life==\nThe son of the [[Royal Navy]] admiral and theologian [[Errol Manners|Sir Errol Manners]] (1883&ndash;1953) and his wife, Florence Maud Harrison (1883&ndash;1967), he was born in [[Exeter]] in September 1914.<ref name=\"TIMES\">{{cite news|url=https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/lieutenant-commander-john-manners-obituary-pwm9ntwlb |title=Lieutenant-Commander John Manners obituary |date=2020-03-16 |work=[[The Times]] |accessdate=2020-03-18 |url-access=subscription}}</ref> He was descended from [[John Manners, 2nd Duke of Rutland]].<ref name=\"OBIT\">{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/obituaries/2020/03/09/lieutenant-commander-john-manners-naval-officer-sank-u-boat/ |title=Lieutenant Commander John Manners, naval officer who sank a U-boat and played cricket for Hampshire \u2013 obituary |date=2019-03-09 |work=[[The Daily Telegraph]] |accessdate=2019-03-15 |url-access=subscription}}</ref> He was educated at Ferndown School,<ref name=\"IND\">{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/obituaries/john-manners-death-cricket-royal-navy-second-world-war-a9408856.html |title=John Manners: Naval war hero and world\u2019s oldest former first-class cricketer |first=Kenneth |last=Shenton |date=2020-03-27 |work=[[The Independent]] |accessdate=2020-03-31}}</ref> before attending [[Britannia Royal Naval College]] as a cadet from the age of 13, following in a family tradition of attending the college.<ref name=\"UNIT\"/><ref name=\"ESPN\">{{cite web|url=http://www.espn.co.uk/cricket/story/_/id/24602746/john-manners-former-hampshire-batsman-becomes-oldest-living-first-class-cricketer |title=John Manners, former Hampshire batsman, becomes oldest living first-class cricketer |publisher=ESPNcricinfo |accessdate=2018-09-13}}</ref> His time as a cadet saw him visit the [[British West Indies|West Indies]] and appear for the college in the schools' match at [[Lord's]] in 1930.<ref name=\"OBIT\"/>\n\n==Early naval and cricket career==\nManners was commissioned as a [[midshipman]] in the [[Royal Navy]] in September 1932, before being made an acting-[[sub-lieutenant]] in January 1935.
