The early training allowed Aicelle to indulge in her original dream to become a famous pianist. However, a shift in focus took place as she realized she would rather be a famous singer than be a known pianist. Aicelle's inspiration on the field came from [[Walt Disney]]'s character [[Ariel (The Little Mermaid)|Ariel]] from the movie ''[[The Little Mermaid]]''. The movie's theme song \"Part of Your World\" was the first song Aicelle memorized, which she also performed during her elementary school programs.\n\nWhile still at her first year of college at the [[Pamantasan ng Lungsod ng Maynila]], Aicelle joined [[ABS-CBN]]'s Season 1 of ''[[Star in a Million]]'' (2003), her first take on a nationwide televised singing competition.

An eight-straight win during preliminaries put Aicelle on top and on the show's history, as the first 'Undefeated Superstar.'

Through her connections with De Vries and Hooper, Madonna got in touch with Bj\u00f6rk and offered her a chance to write a track for ''Bedtime Stories''. Bj\u00f6rk did not consider herself a fan of Madonna's music, but she was intrigued by the offer and she accepted it. She wrote a song initially named \"Let's Get Unconscious\", with the opening lyrics \"Today is the last day, That I'm using words\"\u2014the lines being born out of Bj\u00f6rk's own criticism of Madonna's aesthetic. The singer clarified, \"When I was offered to write a song for [Madonna], I couldn't really picture me doing a song that would suit her...

It was released as the third single from the album on February 13, 1995, by Maverick Records, and it also appears on Madonna's compilation album ''[[GHV2]]'' (2001). \"Bedtime Story\" was written by [[Bj\u00f6rk]], [[Nellee Hooper]] and [[Marius De Vries]]; it was the only time Bj\u00f6rk wrote a song for a Madonna album. She re-wrote a [[demo (music)|demo]] of the song to the current version, which was then produced by Madonna and Hooper. A mid-tempo [[Electronic music|electronic]] and [[house music|house]] song with [[Acid house|acid]], [[Ambient music|ambient]] and [[techno]] influences, \"Bedtime Story\" has an underlying skeletal [[synth]] melody influenced by [[minimal trance]] music. The track was a departure from Madonna's [[Pop music|pop]]-[[Contemporary R&B|R&B]]-based outputs in favor of unconventional and electronic music. Lyrically it talks about the joys of the [[Unconsciousness|unconscious]] world.\n\n\"Bedtime Story\" received favorable reviews from [[Music journalism|music critics]], who praised the song's hypnotic and electronic style, and deemed it an underrated song which could have had great potential. Commercially, the song reached the top ten in the record charts of United Kingdom, Italy and Australia, but missed the top 40 in the United States, while peaking at number one on the US [[Hot Dance Club Songs]] chart. The [[music video]] for \"Bedtime Story\" was directed by [[Mark Romanek]] and is listed as [[List of most expensive music videos|one of the most expensive music videos of all time]] with a cost of $5 million (${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|5|1995|r=2}}}} million in {{Inflation-year|US}} dollars{{inflation-fn|US}}). It features [[surrealism|surrealistic]] and [[new age]] imagery, with influences from artists such as [[Remedios Varo]], [[Frida Kahlo]] and [[Leonora Carrington]]. The video received acclaim from critics and is permanently displayed at the [[Museum of Modern Art]] in New York City.\n\n\"Bedtime Story\" was performed at the [[1995 Brit Awards]] in London with Madonna wearing a silver Versace dress and a long wig, becoming one of the 30 best moments of the awards show history according to ''[[Marie Claire]]''. A remixed version of the track was also used as a video interlude on her [[Re-Invention World Tour]] in 2004. Critics and scholars noted that the song foreshadowed Madonna's move towards [[electronic dance music|electronic music]] in her future work.\n\n==Background and release==\n{{quote box|align=right|width=30%|quote=\"I think at the time, yes, ['Let's Get Unconscious'] was what I wanted to hear from [Madonna's] mouth.

At the time, the words I thought she'd say were, 'I'm not using words anymore, let's get unconscious honey. Fuck logic. Just to be intuitive. Be more free. Go with the flow.'

Madonna also wanted to explore British club music scene, where genres such as [[dub music|dub]] had been growing in popularity. She decided to work with several European producers and composers from the [[electronic music|electronic]] scene, including [[Nellee Hooper]], who pleased Madonna due to his \"very European sensibility\". Inviting Hooper over to Los Angeles, writing sessions started taking place in Chappell Studios, Encino, California.<ref name=\"google291\">{{harvnb|O'Brien|2008|pp=291\u2013292}}</ref>\n\n\"Bedtime Story\" was written by Icelandic [[singer-songwriter]] [[Bj\u00f6rk]], [[Marius De Vries]] and Hooper, and co-produced by Madonna and Hooper.<ref>{{harvnb|Taraborrelli|2008|p=102}}</ref> According to author Mark Pytlik in his book ''Bj\u00f6rk: Wow and Flutter'', Madonna was inspired at that time by Bj\u00f6rk's second studio album, ''[[Debut (Bj\u00f6rk album)|Debut]]'' (1993). Through her connections with De Vries and Hooper, Madonna got in touch with Bj\u00f6rk and offered her a chance to write a track for ''Bedtime Stories''. Bj\u00f6rk did not consider herself a fan of Madonna's music, but she was intrigued by the offer and she accepted it. She wrote a song initially named \"Let's Get Unconscious\", with the opening lyrics \"Today is the last day, That I'm using words\"\u2014the lines being born out of Bj\u00f6rk's own criticism of Madonna's aesthetic. The singer clarified, \"When I was offered to write a song for [Madonna], I couldn't really picture me doing a song that would suit her... But on second thought, I decided to do this to write the things I have always wanted to hear her say that she's never said.\"<ref name=\"google82\">{{harvnb|Pytlik|2003|pp=82\u201383}}</ref>\n\nOnce the song [[demo (music)|demo]] had been finished, De Vries and Hooper rearranged the track and the final version was called \"Bedtime Story\". The song was eventually released as the third single from the parent album, ''Bedtime Stories'', on February 13, 1995.<ref name=\"idolator\"/> Bj\u00f6rk later confessed that Madonna had got few of the lyrics wrong, like instead of the original \"learning logic and reason\" Madonna included it as \"leaving logic and reason\".<ref name=\"ret\">{{harvnb|Rettenmund|2016|p=51}}</ref> The original demo was later re-worked and released as \"Sweet Intuition\", which appeared as a B-side on Bj\u00f6rk's \"[[Army of Me (Bj\u00f6rk song)|Army of Me]]\" single and remixed on the \"[[It's Oh So Quiet]]\" single.<ref>{{harvnb|Pytlik|2003|p=194}}</ref>\n\n==Recording and composition==\n{{listen\n | pos          = left\n | filename     = Madonna-bedtime story.ogg\n | title        = 'Bedtime Story'\n | description  = Madonna sings lyrics for \"Bedtime Story\", accompanied by house beats, ambient and new age-inspired melodies.

It ends abruptly saying \"And all that you've ever learned, try to forget, I'll never explain again\" making the listener believe that it was all the part of a dream.<ref name=\"rikky\"/>\n\nAccording to Victor Amaro Vicente in his book ''The aesthetics of motion in musics for the Mevlana Celal ed-Din Rumi'', the song's music bears many resemblances to [[new age]]-era music and different forms of [[Sufi music]].<ref name=\"google253\"/> Its slow atmospheric qualities have drawn comparison to \"[[Mevlevi]]-[[Sufi]] Relaxation\" and the song's intricate, \"steady and continuous\" rhythmic structure has also drawn comparison to the ''[[Dhikr|zikr]]'' ceremony.<ref name=\"google253\"/> Bj\u00f6rk, one of the song's writers, has been credited for giving the song its particular style and according to De Vries, the track's architecture is \"distinctly Bj\u00f6rkian\" and she \"has such a particular and idiosyncratic approach to the construction of lyrics and phrasing\".<ref name=\"google293\">{{harvnb|O'Brien|2008|p=293}}</ref> In a chapter of ''Music and Technoculture'' written by Charity Marsh and Melissa West, it is stated that one can hear the influence of Bj\u00f6rk in Madonna's vocals during the song.<ref>{{harvnb|T.

Lysloff|2003|pp=182}}</ref>\n\nRikky Rooksby, author of ''The Complete Guide to the Music of Madonna'', noted that the lyrics of \"Bedtime Story\" are an hymn to the joys of unconsciousness and a rejection of the supposed constraints of reason and language, hence the line \"Words are useless, especially sentences, They don't stand for anything, How could they explain how I feel?\"<ref name=\"rikky\"/> Lyrically, despite being a song about a trip to the unconscious, scholars have noticed subtexts within the song's meaning. Vicente noted that [[postmodern]]ism and [[new age]] themes are prevalent within the lyrics, especially with regards to their incapability of articulating the concept of the truth, as well as the song's theme of [[meditation]] and relax.

Released in 1978, its 1979 rerelease made it a hit in the [[United Kingdom]] a6nd [[United States]].  \n\nThe demo of the song was recorded at [[Pathway Studios]], North London, in July 1977 and quickly acquired a following after it was put on [[Rotation (music)|rotation]] at [[BBC London 94.9|Radio London]]. Its popularity soon reached record executives, and Dire Straits were offered a contract with [[Phonogram Records]]. The song was then re-recorded in February 1978 at [[Basing Street Studios]] for the band's debut album''.'' The record company wanted a less-polished rock sound for the radio, so an alternative version was recorded at Pathway Studios in April 1978 and released as the single in some countries including the United Kingdom and Germany.{{citation needed|date=January 2019}}\n\nThe B-side, Eastbound Train, is a live track that otherwise only appears on the Live at the Hope & Anchor Front Row Festival album.\n\n==Background and composition==\n\"Sultans of Swing\" was composed by [[Mark Knopfler]] on a [[National Steel Guitar|National Steel guitar]] in [[open tuning]]. He thought the song was \"dull\" until he bought his first [[Fender Stratocaster|Stratocaster]] in 1977: \"It just came alive as soon as I played it on that '61 Strat ... the new chord changes just presented themselves and fell into place.\"<ref name=\"greatest solos\"/>\n\nThe lyrics were inspired by a performance of a [[jazz]] band playing in the corner of an almost empty pub in [[Deptford]], South London.

Released in 1978, its 1979 rerelease made it a hit in the [[United Kingdom]] and [[United States]].  \n\nThe demo of the song was recorded at [[Pathway Studios]], North London, in July 1977 and quickly acquired a following after it was put on [[Rotation (music)|rotation]] at [[BBC London 94.9|Radio London]]. Its popularity soon reached record executives, and Dire Straits were offered a contract with [[Phonogram Records]]. The song was then re-recorded in February 1978 at [[Basing Street Studios]] for the band's debut album''.'' The record company wanted a less-polished rock sound for the radio, so an alternative version was recorded at Pathway Studios in April 1978 and released as the single in some countries including the United Kingdom and Germany.{{citation needed|date=January 2019}}\n\nThe B-side, Eastbound Train, is a live track that otherwise only appears on the Live at the Hope & Anchor Front Row Festival album.\n\n==Background and composition==\n\"Sultans of Swing\" was composed by [[Mark Knopfler]] on a [[National Steel Guitar|National Steel guitar]] in [[open tuning]]. He thought the song was \"dull\" until he bought his first [[Fender Stratocaster|Stratocaster]] in 1977: \"It just came alive as soon as I played it on that '61 Strat ... the new chord changes just presented themselves and fell into place.\"<ref name=\"greatest solos\"/>\n\nThe lyrics were inspired by a performance of a [[jazz]] band playing in the corner of an almost empty pub in [[Deptford]], South London. At the end of their performance, the lead singer announced their name, the Sultans of Swing; Knopfler found the contrast between the group's dowdy appearance and surroundings and their grandiose name amusing.<ref>{{cite web|title=Song Stories - \"Sultans of Swing\"|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/song-stories/sultans-of-swing-dire-straits|work=[[Rolling Stone]]|accessdate=16 April 2014}}</ref>\n\nFolk singer and Columbia recording artist Bill Wilson (1947\u20131993) claimed to have co-written the song.<ref name=Fish>{{cite web|last=Fish |first=George |url=http://www.stringdancer.com/billwilson/index_files/Article-Nuvo12081993.pdf |format=PDF |title=Say Good-bye to a legend |series=December 8\u201316, 1993 |publisher=Nuvo.net  |via=Stringdancer.com |accessdate=2016-07-27}}</ref><ref name=Nichols>{{cite web|last=Nichols |first=Rob |url=http://www.nuvo.net/indianapolis/bill-wilsons-back/Content?oid=2512934#.U41bPNzC7MU |title=Bill Wilson's back &#124; Local Music Profiles &#124; NUVO News &#124; Indianapolis, IN |publisher=Nuvo.net |date= |accessdate=2016-07-27}}</ref> Wilson did not get a songwriting credit on the release,<ref name=Fish/> but claimed to have received some monetary compensation for his input.<ref name=Nichols/>\n\nThe song is set in [[Common-time|common time]], with a [[tempo (music)|tempo]] of 149 [[beats per minute]].

Sure, [[Donald Fagen]] and [[Tom Waits]] were writing great lyrics about characters you'd love to meet and [[Jeff Beck]] and [[Eddie Van Halen]] were great guitar players. But Knopfler, he could do both things as well or better than anybody out there in his own way, and didn't seem to have any obvious rock influences unless you try to include Dylan. Like his contemporary and future duet partner [[Sting (musician)|Sting]], Knopfler's ideas were intellectually and musically stimulating, but were also accessible to the average listener. It was almost like jazz for the layman. \"Sultans of Swing\" was a lesson in [[prosody (music)|prosody]] and tasty guitar playing that has seldom been equaled since.

Following its re-issue in January 1979, the song entered the American music pop chart. Unusually, the success of this single release came more than six months after the relatively unheralded release of the band's debut album in October 1978. BBC Radio was initially unwilling to play the song due to its high lyrical content but after it became a U.S. hit, their line softened.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.hurriyetdailynews.com/h.php?news=humble-guitar-hero-in-istanbul-tonight-2008-06-13 |title=Humble guitar hero in Istanbul tonight |work=H\u00fcrriyet Daily News and Economic Review |accessdate=2009-10-07 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110723135907/http://www.hurriyetdailynews.com/h.php?news=humble-guitar-hero-in-istanbul-tonight-2008-06-13|archive-date=23 July 2011|url-status=live}}</ref> The song reached the top 10 in both the UK and the U.S., reaching No. 8 on the [[UK Singles Chart]] and No. 4 on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] and helped drive sales of the album, which also became a hit.\n\n\"Sultans of Swing\" was re-issued again as a single in November 1988, a month after it appeared on the band's greatest hits album ''[[Money for Nothing (album)|Money for Nothing]],'' when it peaked at No. 62. It was also included on ''[[Sultans of Swing: The Very Best of Dire Straits]]'' and ''[[The Best of Dire Straits & Mark Knopfler: Private Investigations]].''\n\n==Other versions==\nKnopfler has improvised and expanded the solo during live performances.
