It covers {{Convert|36|ha}} and, in March 2006, housed 4,850 animals representing 840 [[species]].\n\n== History ==\n\nInitially, the zoo was located in the park of the former royal palace, with the primary attraction being a [[Eurasian black vulture]] caught in Bulgaria and exhibited in a cage in the garden. Later, [[pheasant]]s and deer were added to the collection, but since the exhibits and facilities of the time proved inadequate to accommodate a pair of [[brown bear]]s, [[Tsar]] [[Ferdinand of Bulgaria]] ordered a grant of land to be awarded to Sofia Zoo on the grounds of the former [[botanical garden]], then in the outskirts of the city.<ref name=\"zoo_history\"/>\n\nSofia Zoo's exhibition of animals constantly increased, with both local and foreign species being added, most notably a pair of [[lion]]s in 1892, which were housed in a former stable and a lion cub was born the same year.<ref name=\"zoo_history\"/>\n\nBetween 1893 and 1895, new cages and buildings were constructed to accommodate the ever-increasing collection of birds and [[mammal]]s, including a solid three-room stone building in the back of the terrain designed to be inhabited by bears (1894), a pool where a few [[pink-backed pelican]]s lived, a building to accommodate pheasants and another one for [[eagle]]s (1895).<ref name=\"zoo_history\"/>\n\nSofia Zoo moved from its original (and smaller) location in the centre of the city to a new {{Convert|36|ha|sing=on}} site about {{Convert|4.5|km|mi}} south of Sofia in 1982.<ref name=\"zoo_about\"/>\n\n== Exhibits ==\n; Grazing animals\nThe zoo has some 80 individuals representing 20 grazing species, including [[White rhinoceros|white rhinos]],  [[hippopotamus]], [[elephant]], [[zebra]]s, [[red deer]], [[Capra (genus)|ibex]], [[wild boar]], [[Dromedary|dromedary camels]], and [[American bison]].<ref name=\"zoo_grazing\"/>\n\n; Primates\nPrimates are housed in two pavilions. The zoo has 93 individuals representing 19 species, including [[ring-tailed lemur]]s, [[yellow baboon]]s, [[common marmoset]], and [[macaque]]s.<ref name=\"zoo_primates\"/>\n\n; Predators\nThe predator sector houses big cats, bears and small predators, including [[lion]]s, [[tiger]]s, [[leopard]]s, [[cougar|pumas]] and [[brown bear]]s.<ref name=\"zoo_predators\"/>\n\n; Penguins\nIn January 2011 the zoo received eight [[Humboldt penguin]]s on loan from Germany. The penguins are on loan for about 18 months, after which they will be returned, with any offspring to stay at the zoo.<ref name=\"focus\"/><ref name=\"novinite2\"/>\n[[File:Sofia Zoo 026.jpg|thumb|Eagle's cage|300px]]\n; Birds\nThe zoo has some 1,400 individual birds representing 192 species. Waterbirds are housed in a {{Convert|1.5|ha|sing=on}} lake, and [[Imperial eagle]]s, [[Griffon vulture]]s, [[Egyptian vulture]]s and [[buzzard]]s in a large walk-through aviary.

It covers {{Convert|36|ha}} and, in March 2006, housed 4,850 animals representing 840 [[species]].\n\n== History ==\n\nInitially, the zoo was located in the park of the former royal palace, with the primary attraction being a [[Eurasian black vulture]] caught in Bulgaria and exhibited in a cage in the garden. Later, [[pheasant]]s and deer were added to the collection, but since the exhibits and facilities of the time proved inadequate to accommodate a pair of [[brown bear]]s, [[Tsar]] [[Ferdinand of Bulgaria]] ordered a grant of land to be awarded to Sofia Zoo on the grounds of the former [[botanical garden]], then in the outskirts of the city.<ref name=\"zoo_history\"/>\n\nSofia Zoo's exhibition of animals constantly increased, with both local and foreign species being added, most notably a pair of [[lion]]s in 1892, which were housed in a former stable and a lion cub was born the same year.<ref name=\"zoo_history\"/>\n\nBetween 1893 and 1895, new cages and buildings were constructed to accommodate the ever-increasing collection of birds and [[mammal]]s, including a solid three-room stone building in the back of the terrain designed to be inhabited by bears (1894), a pool where a few [[pink-backed pelican]]s lived, a building to accommodate pheasants and another one for [[eagle]]s (1895).<ref name=\"zoo_history\"/>\n\nSofia Zoo moved from its original (and smaller) location in the centre of the city to a new {{Convert|36|ha|sing=on}} site about {{Convert|4.5|km|mi}} south of Sofia in 1982.<ref name=\"zoo_about\"/>\n\n== Exhibits ==\n; Grazing animals\nThe zoo has some 80 individuals representing 20 grazing species, including [[White rhinoceros|white rhinos]],  [[hippopotamus]], [[elephant]], [[zebra]]s, [[red deer]], [[Capra (genus)|ibex]], [[wild boar]], [[Dromedary|dromedary camels]], and [[American bison]].<ref name=\"zoo_grazing\"/>\n\n; Primates\nPrimates are housed in two pavilions. The zoo has 93 individuals representing 19 species, including [[ring-tailed lemur]]s, [[yellow baboon]]s, [[common marmoset]], and [[macaque]]s.<ref name=\"zoo_primates\"/>\n\n; Predators\nThe predator sector houses big cats, bears and small predators, including [[lion]]s, [[tiger]]s, [[leopard]]s, [[cougar|pumas]] and [[brown bear]]s.<ref name=\"zoo_predators\"/>\n\n; Penguins\nIn January 2011 the zoo received eight [[Humboldt penguin]]s on loan from Germany. The penguins are on loan for about 18 months, after which they will be returned, with any offspring to stay at the zoo.<ref name=\"focus\"/><ref name=\"novinite2\"/>\n[[File:Sofia Zoo 026.jpg|thumb|Eagle's cage|300px]]\n; Birds\nThe zoo has some 1,400 individual birds representing 192 species.

This watercourse successively crosses [[zec des Martres]], then the [[Laurentides Wildlife Reserve]].\n\nThe lower part of this valley is served by the [[Quebec Route 381|route 381]]. The upper part is served by the forest road R0305 which passes on the south shore of [[Barley Lake]] for the needs of forestry. Forestry is the main economic activity in this valley; recreational tourism, second.\n\nBecause of the altitude, the surface of the Barley River is generally frozen from the end of November until the beginning of April; however, safe circulation on the ice is generally from the beginning of December until the end of March. The water level of the river varies with the seasons and the precipitation; the spring flood generally occurs in April.\n\n== Geography ==\nThe Barley River originates from Lake Wabano (length: {{convert|0.8|km}}; altitude: {{convert|861|m}}) landlocked between mountains, located in a forest area in the unorganized territory of [[Lac-Pikauba, Quebec|Lac-Pikauba]] in the [[zec des Martres]]. The mouth of Lake Wabano is located to the southwest, at:\n* {{convert|12.5|km}} south-west of the confluence of the [[rivi\u00e8re des Martres]] and the [[Malbaie River]];\n* {{convert|39.5|km}} west of [[La Malbaie]] town center;\n* {{convert|41.7|km}} north-west of [[Baie-Saint-Paul]] town center.<ref name=Atlas/>.\n\nFrom its source, the course of the Barley River descends on {{convert|16.4|km}} in a generally deep valley, with a drop of {{convert|231|m}}, according to the following segments:\n\n* {{convert|2.3|km}} west, in particular by crossing on {{convert|1.5|km}} the [[Lesclache Lake]] (length: {{convert|2.1|km}} in the north-south direction; altitude: {{convert|817|m}}), to its mouth;\n* {{convert| 4.1 | km}} west, in particular by crossing [[Barley Lake]] (length: {{convert|3.5|km}} including a peninsula stretching on {{convert|1.0|m}} northward; altitude: {{convert|802|m}}) in its full length, up to the dam at its mouth;\n* {{convert|3.2|km}} the southwest by forming a small loop towards the north to collect the discharge (coming from the north) of [[\u00c9vanturel Lake]], crossing a zone of rapids, then crossing Lac du Coq (length : {{convert|1.9|km}}; altitude: {{convert|766|m}}) over its full length, up to the dam at its mouth. Note: Lac du Coq receives from the southeast the discharge of three small lakes;\n* {{convert|1.5|km}} to the southwest by crossing a series of rapids and collecting a stream (coming from the north), then to the west by crossing two series of rapids, to the discharge (from the south) of Petit lac Barley;\n* {{convert|2.3|km}} north-west, up to the outlet (coming from the north-east) of Lac Joncas;\n* {{convert|3.0|km}} north-west across a series of rapids, to its mouth.<ref name=Atlas/>\n\nThe Barley River flows onto the west bank of the [[Malbaie River]], in the unorganized territory of [[Lac-Pikauba, Quebec|Lac-Pikauba]], in the [[Laurentides Wildlife Reserve]]. This mouth is located at:\n\n* {{convert|1.7|km}} east of a mountain peak (altitude: {{convert|984|m}});\n* {{convert|15.2|km}} downstream of the mouth of the [[Petite rivi\u00e8re Malbaie]];\n* {{convert|47.6|km}} north-west of downtown [[Baie-Saint-Paul]];\n* {{convert|51.0|km}} west of downtown La Malbaie.<ref name=Atlas/>\n\nFrom the mouth of the Barley River, the current descends on {{convert|108|km}} with a drop of {{convert|656|m}} following the course of the Malbaie river which flows into La Malbaie in the [[St. Lawrence River]].<ref name=Atlas>[https://atlas.gc.ca/toporama/en/index.html Atlas of Canada - Department of Natural Resources Canada - Barley River - Distance and altitude measurements established from the application of site measurements.]</ref>\n\n== Toponymy ==\nDuring the history the spelling of this toponym knew the variants: Berly, Berley and in Berley. In 1927, the current Barley spelling was finally fixed. This toponym evokes the life work of Pierre Berly, Amerindian of Abenaki origin who camped in the region.

This watercourse successively crosses [[zec des Martres]], then the [[Laurentides Wildlife Reserve]].\n\nThe lower part of this valley is served by the [[Quebec Route 381|route 381]]. The upper part is served by the forest road R0305 which passes on the south shore of [[Barley Lake]] for the needs of forestry. Forestry is the main economic activity in this valley; recreational tourism, second.\n\nBecause of the altitude, the surface of the Barley River is generally frozen from the end of November until the beginning of April; however, safe circulation on the ice is generally from the beginning of December until the end of March. The water level of the river varies with the seasons and the precipitation; the spring flood generally occurs in April.\n\n== Geography ==\nThe Barley River originates from Lake Wabano (length: {{convert|0.8|km}}; altitude: {{convert|861|m}}) landlocked between mountains, located in a forest area in the unorganized territory of [[Lac-Pikauba, Quebec|Lac-Pikauba]] in the [[zec des Martres]].

Note: Lac du Coq receives from the southeast the discharge of three small lakes;\n* {{convert|1.5|km}} to the southwest by crossing a series of rapids and collecting a stream (coming from the north), then to the west by crossing two series of rapids, to the discharge (from the south) of Petit lac Barley;\n* {{convert|2.3|km}} north-west, up to the outlet (coming from the north-east) of Lac Joncas;\n* {{convert|3.0|km}} north-west across a series of rapids, to its mouth.<ref name=Atlas/>\n\nThe Barley River flows onto the west bank of the [[Malbaie River]], in the unorganized territory of [[Lac-Pikauba, Quebec|Lac-Pikauba]], in the [[Laurentides Wildlife Reserve]]. This mouth is located at:\n\n* {{convert|1.7|km}} east of a mountain peak (altitude: {{convert|984|m}});\n* {{convert|15.2|km}} downstream of the mouth of the [[Petite rivi\u00e8re Malbaie]];\n* {{convert|47.6|km}} north-west of downtown [[Baie-Saint-Paul]];\n* {{convert|51.0|km}} west of downtown La Malbaie.<ref name=Atlas/>\n\nFrom the mouth of the Barley River, the current descends on {{convert|108|km}} with a drop of {{convert|656|m}} following the course of the Malbaie river which flows into La Malbaie in the [[St. Lawrence River]].<ref name=Atlas>[https://atlas.gc.ca/toporama/en/index.html Atlas of Canada - Department of Natural Resources Canada - Barley River - Distance and altitude measurements established from the application of site measurements.]</ref>\n\n== Toponymy ==\nDuring the history the spelling of this toponym knew the variants: Berly, Berley and in Berley. In 1927, the current Barley spelling was finally fixed. This toponym evokes the life work of Pierre Berly, Amerindian of Abenaki origin who camped in the region.

These discourses were translated from Danish to English in the 1940s, and from Danish to German in the 1950s, and then to English again in 1990. These Discourses were published along with Kierkegaard's pseudonymous works.\n\nScholars generally say that \"Kierkegaard's books were of two kinds. There was a series of books ascribed to [[pseudonym]]s, which Kierkegaard described as \"aesthetic\" in character. In ''[[Either/Or]]'', ''[[Fear and Trembling]]'', and [[Repetition (Kierkegaard)|''Repetition'']], Kierkegaard explores the nature of human [[Passion (emotion)|passion]]s in a variety of forms, often presenting his own experiences in a [[poetry|poetically]] disguised [[narrative]]\". The pseudonymous books as well as his discourses are understood to be directed to the love of his life, Regine Olsen. \"He hoped to reveal himself at last to [[Regine Olsen|Regine]] in this \"indirect\" manner. At the same time that these [[aesthetic]] writings were being published, Kierkegaard wrote a series of edifying, [[sermon]] like essays, although he was careful to insist that they were not sermons, in part because he had not been [[ordained]] and therefore lacked \"authority.\" Through these he communicated his underlying religious commitments in a more \"direct\" fashion. Kierkegaard continued to write these \"edifying discourses\" throughout his life, but as he grew older they focused on more distinctively [[Christianity|Christian]] themes and took on a decidedly sharper tone.\"<ref>''Soren Kierkegaard's Christian Psychology: Insight for Counseling and Pastoral Care'' By C. Stephen Evans, Regent College Publishing, 1995  p. 16</ref>\n \nKierkegaard says individuals are \"squeezed into the forms of actuality\"{{refn|He talks about the possibility of freedom from becoming the product of actuality by choosing yourself. Here is the complete quote from ''Either/Or'': \"As a product he is squeezed into the forms of actuality; in the choice he makes himself elastic, transforms everything exterior into interiority. He has his place in the world; in freedom he himself chooses his place-that is he chooses this place. He is a specific individual; in the choice he makes himself into a specific individual; namely, into the same one, because he chooses himself. An individual thus chooses himself as a complex specific concretion and therefore chooses himself in his [http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/continuity continuity]. This concretion is the individual\u2019s actuality, but since he chooses it according to his freedom, it may also be said that it is his possibility or, in order not to use such an [http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/aesthetic aesthetic] expression, it is his task. In other words, the person who lives esthetically has only possibilities everywhere; for him these make up the content of future time, whereas the person who lives [http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/ethically ethically] sees tasks everywhere. Then the individual sees this, his actual concretion, as tasks, as goal, as objective. But in seeing his possibility as his task, the individual expresses precisely his sovereignty over himself, something he never surrenders, even though on the other hand he does not relish the very [http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/constrain constrained] sovereignty that a king without a county always has. This gives the ethical person a [http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/security security] that the person who lives esthetically lacks altogether. The person who lives esthetically expects everything from the outside. This accounts for the sickly anxiety with which many people speak of the dreadfulness of not having found their place in the world. Who will deny the joy in having made a good catch in this respect, but such an anxiety always indicates that the individual expects everything from the place, nothing from himself. The person who lives ethically will also be careful about choosing his place properly, but if he detects that he has made a mistake, or if obstacles are raised that are beyond his control, he does not lose heart, for he does not surrender sovereignty over himself. He promptly sees his task and therefore is in action without delay. ''Either/Or Part 2'', Hong p. 251-252|group=\"note\"}} but that they have a choice as to what form they will put on. He says \"the transition made in ''Either/Or'' is substantially that from a poet-existence to an ethical existence.<ref>''Point of View'', Lowrie, Note: p. 74</ref>\n\nHe \"held out Either/Or to the world in his left hand, and in his right he held the [[Two Upbuilding Discourses, 1843|Two Edifying Discourses]]; but all, or as good as all, grasped with their right what he held in his left hand. Kierkegaard wrote in 1848, \u201cI had made up my mind before God what I should do: I staked my case on the Two Edifying Discourses; but I understood perfectly that only very few understood them. And here for the first time comes in the category \u2018that individual' who with joy and gratitude I call ''my reader''.\u2019 A stereo typed formula which was repeated in the Preface to every collection of Edifying Discourses.<ref>Point of View p. 19-20</ref> Now he holds out these two discourses of 1844 with his right hand and hopes for better results. He says in his dedication to \"that single individual', <blockquote>Although this little book (which is called \u201cdiscourses\u2019, not sermons, because its author does not have authority to preach; \u201cupbuilding discourses,\u201d not discourses for upbuilding, because the speaker by no means claims to be a teacher) has left out something, it nevertheless has forgotten nothing; although it is not without hope in the world, it nevertheless totally renounces all hope in the uncertain or of the uncertain. Tempted, perhaps, as the earlier ones were not, it takes no delight in \u201cgoing to the house of feasting,\u201d desires as little as they \u201cthat its visit might be in vain\u201d (I Thessalonians 2:1); even though a person was not without education insofar as he learned from what he suffered, it still would never be very pleasant if he needed to suffer much in order to learn little. Its desire is to give thanks if on the word of authority it were to win the tacit permission of the multitude to dare to go its way unnoticed in order to find what it seeks: that single individual whom I with joy and gratitude call my reader, who with the right hand accepts what is offered with the right hand; that single individual who at the opportune time takes out what he received and hides what he took out until he takes it out again and thus by his good will, his wisdom, invests the humble gift to the benefit and joy of one who continually desires only to be as one absent on a journey.

You may have heard it from those who were there with him, who with sadness, but also deeply moved, had to confess that in those few hours he had lived more than in all the rest of his life, more than is lived in years and days as people ordinarily live.\"<ref name=\"EUDp181\">''Eighteen Upbuilding Discourses'', Hong p. 181</ref>\n\nHe provides examples of how different people react to danger and [[anxiety]]. He regards the single individual very highly and says, \"Let us praise what is truly praiseworthy, the glory of human nature; let us give thanks that it was granted also to us to be [[human]] [[beings]].\"<ref name=\"EUDp182\">''Eighteen Upbuilding Discourses'', Hong p. 182</ref>\n\nKierkegaard provides three examples of people reacting to anxiety and despair, all of them as praiseworthy as the physical endurance to defeat an external enemy. Both have been important factors since the publication of [[Either/Or]]. he writes,\n\nOne person \"surveyed everything and the horrifying situation, how quickly presence of mind assuredly chose the right thing as if it were the fruit of the most mature reflection, how the will, even the eyes, defied the threatening terrors, how the body did not even feel the exertion, the agonizing suffering, how the arms lightly carried the burden that far exceeded human strength, how the feet stood firm where others did not dare to look down because they saw the abyss!\"<ref name=\"EUDp181\"/>\n\nWhile another \"person discovered a danger while all speak of peace and security, if he discerned the horror and after having used the healthiest power of his soul to make himself fully aware of it, again with the horror before his eyes, now developed and preserved the same strength of soul as the one who fought in peril of his life, the same inwardness as the one who fought with death-yes, then we shall praise him.\"<ref name=\"EUDp182\"/>\n\nAnother \"with troubled [[imagination]] conjured up anxieties he was unable to surmount, while he still could not leave off staring at them, evoking them ever more alarmingly, pondering them ever more fearfully, then we shall not praise him, even though we praise the wonderful glory of human nature. But if he [[Psychotherapy|brought out the horror and detected the mortal danger]], without any thought of providing people, by pointless talk, with subject matter for pointless pondering, but grasped that the danger had to do with himself-if, then, with this in mind, he won the strength of soul that horror gives, this would in truth be praiseworthy, would in truth be wondrously wonderful.\"<ref name=\"EUDp183\">''Eighteen Upbuilding Discourses'', Hong p. 183</ref>\n[[File:Rembrandt - Balaam.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Patience has another phrase, a powerful phrase, just what the anxious one needs. (...) Let us regard patience as an angel of deliverance who stands there with his flaming sword, and every time the soul is about to rush out to the outermost boundary of despair it must pass by him; he judges the soul but also strengthens it. (...) he soberly turns them back and says: Take courage; I am standing here, I never doze off; go home again, prepare your souls in patience and quiet alertness.<ref>''Eighteen Upbuilding Discourses'', Hong p. 200-201</ref>]]\n\nThis act of self-discovery is the essence of what Kierkegaard wrote about. He says, \"People are prone to pay attention to earthly dangers<ref name=\"EUDp183\"/> but these are external dangers. Kierkegaard says, we need to preserve something internal; our souls.\"<ref>''Eighteen Upbuilding Discourses'', Hong p. 185 compare [[Plato's tripartite theory of soul]]</ref> He explains himself, <blockquote>Just as there is only one means<ref>means in this case means the same as way, so it could read, there is only one way for preserving it- ''Editor''</ref> for preserving it, so is this means necessary even in order to [[understanding|understand]] that it must be preserved, and if this were not the case, the means would not be the only means. This means is patience. A person does not first gain his soul and then have the need for patience to preserve it, but he gains it in no other way than by preserving it, and therefore patience is the first and patience is the last, precisely because patience is just as active as it is passive and just as passive as it is active. ''Eighteen Upbuilding Discourses'', Hong p. 187</blockquote>\n\nThere are two paths people take in life. The path of patience or the path of impatience. Kierkegaard puts it so well, {{Quotation|<blockquote>Then the young person went on his way, and patience repeated its promise not to abandon him if he would keep to it. His path was delightful, his walking was easy, and not at all as his fatherly friend patience had taught him it would be. The young people joined him enthusiastically; the elderly turned and looked wistfully after him. So quickly did he go that he even left expectancy behind him without missing it, because fortune followed his steps, advancement his deeds, success his plans. His gold procured everything for him, even the service of envy; his favor was the price that bought everything, even the applause of his rivals. His plans became bolder; even fortune became so happy about them that in order to contend with him it became bolder and bolder. Patience called to him in vain; when at every moment there is a world to win-something patience, in fact, had never spoken of-then patience can well wait until tomorrow. Then he stood on the pinnacle-proudly he gazed downward. He was nauseated by all of it, by the glitter of gold, by the vanity of pleasure, by the cowardliness of men-[[Market (economics)|everything, in fact, was for sale]], everything. Was it fortune that had made him impatient? It certainly had indulged him in everything; it would still indulge him, and nevertheless he languished in the cold heart of impatience. ''Eighteen Upbuilding Discourses'' p. 194-195</blockquote>}}\n\n<blockquote>Does not patience perceive that the greatest danger is that the [[anxiety|elucidating understanding\u2019s fears]] prove not to be the case, for then not even patience could comfort anymore? Now it can, if only the sick one so desires, since the danger is whether the sick one is to be allowed to emancipate himself from the eternal, to wither away in [[common sense|commonsensicality]], to expire in callousness, to be desouled in spiritlessness. And against this danger there is still a resource. He who, believing, continues to aspire to the eternal never becomes satiated in such a way that he does not continue blessedly to hunger; he who [[optimism|hopefully looks to the future]] can never be [[pessimist|petrified at some moment by the past]], because he always turns his back to it; he who loves God and human beings still continually has enough to do, even when need is the greatest and [[Existentialism#Despair|despair]] is most imminent. Before he lies down to die, he asks once again: Do I love God just as much as before, and do I love the common concerns of human beings? If he dares to answer in the affirmative, then he does not die or he dies saved; if he dare not, then he certainly has enough to do. Then in love and for the sake of his love he must [[thought|deliberate]] whether it is not possible to see, to glimpse, to presage the joy and comfort that still must hide in the sadness, since this must still truly serve him for good. ''Eighteen Upbuilding Discourses'' p. 198-199</blockquote>\n\n=== Patience in Expectation ===\n[[File:Rembrandt Harmensz. van Rijn 056.jpg|thumb|250px|Is Anna not patient in her expectancy? Even though in the world we hear at times of someone who expects nothing at all, even though such a person is sometimes thought to have attained the proper assurance, because he craftily made it impossible for himself to discern the loss, yet it is also admitted that this wisdom is of later origin, and that no one has it in early youth. Originally, like every other human being he was expectant. With a smile or with tears, one confesses that expectancy is in the soul originally. ''Eighteen Upbuilding Discourses'', Patience in Expectation, p. 220]]\n\nKierkegaard's intention in the preceding discourse was to speak as if patience were outside a person. He says, \"we are well aware that this is not so. And nevertheless I ask you, you who know better how to praise it than I, know better how to accomplish the good, how to commend it to people, since you have known it better, more inwardly and for a longer time-was it nevertheless not so at times, when concern and your laboring thoughts piled up deliberations that were of no benefit except to give birth to new deliberations, that then the plain, simple, but nevertheless forgotten words of patience prodded you from another direction, was it not as if patience stool on the outside? We have made it appear as if patience were outside, and we have let it speak, as it were, for itself.\"<ref>''Eighteen Upbuilding Discourses'' p. 202</ref>\n\nNow he brings out a real person, just as he did in ''Either/Or'' (A and B), in ''Fear and Trembling'' (Abraham), and in ''Repetition'' (the Young Man and Constantin Constanius). He brings out [[Anna (Bible)|Anna]] and focuses primarily on her and her expectancy. What he drives home is that God is the constant that remains the same, whereas everything else changes. What he exhorts us to is to love God in such a way that our nature might be like his, that we might gain God in constancy and rescue our soul in patience.<ref>''Eighteen Upbuilding Discourses'' p. 40</ref>\n\nWhat is it about expectancy that it either blesses or curses the single individual? Kierkegaard says, \"How often it is said that no one is to be considered happy until he is dead, but how seldom is a troubled person heard to say that one should not give up as long as one is living, that there is hope as long as there is life-and consequently there is always hope for the immortal who expect an eternity.\"<ref name=\"EUDp214\">''Eighteen Upbuilding Discourses'' p. 214</ref> His advice to the person who believes that their past life has destroyed all expectancy is to: \u201cForget the past once again, quit all this calculating in which you trap yourself, do not stop the prompting of your heart, do not extinguish the spirit in useless quarreling about who waited the longest and suffered the most-once again cast all your sorrow upon the Lord and throw yourself upon his love. Up out of this sea, expectancy rises reborn again and sees heaven open-reborn, no newborn, for this heavenly expectancy begins precisely when the [[Either/Or#Equilibrium between the Aesthetic and the Ethical in the Development of Personality|earthly expectancy sinks down powerless and in despair]].\u201d<ref name=\"EUDp214\"/>\n\nBut the expectant person should always remember that \"every time he catches his soul not expecting victory, he knows he does not have faith.\"<ref>''Eighteen Upbuilding Discourses'' p. 27</ref> Anna had a choice, the same as everyone has, and used it. Kierkegaard says, {{Quotation|Her [[choice]] is made. It did not happen yesterday or the day before yesterday so that we should be ready with our assistance to get it changed. Her choice is made, and if she has regretted it, the time of regret has been long. She chose to remain faithful to her late husband, as he had been faithful to her, or to say it another and more truthful way, even though it might not seem as beautiful to her, she chose to remain [[Authenticity (philosophy)|true to herself]]; after all, every external bond was dissolved, and only that love bound her in which she had her [[Free will|freedom]] and without which she would not have known herself again. In this fidelity, her life became very poor in variety, which some people achieve to the point of repulsiveness, but her life became fruitful for the eternal. And whatever you may think of this, my listener, it is certainly [[Liberty|up to each individual to decide on his own]], so that according to circumstances one choice may be just as commendable in its fervent love as another, but this much is certain-that the woman who is busy consoling herself over the loss of her late husband is hardly God\u2019s choice to appear as a witness of expectancy in the hour when the [[Nativity of Jesus|expectancy of the human race has its fulfillment]]. ''Eighteen Upbuilding Discourses'' p. 209-210}}\n\n== Criticism ==\nThese upbuilding discourses were translated edifying discourses by [[David F. Swenson (translator)|David F. Swenson]] when he translated them in the mid-1940s. He wrote the following in his [[preface]] to this discourse. \"The discourses appearing in the present volume constitute the fourth and fifth groups in the series of eighteen devotional addresses, and both groups were published in 1844. It may be of some interest to consider more particularly than has hitherto been done, the plan and purpose of these productions, paralleling as they do in time of publication the publication of the esthetic works. Unlike the latter, these addresses were published under Kierkegaard's own name, because as religious works he assumed personal responsibility for the views expressed, since their purpose was to indicate that from the beginning his writing had a religious motivation and plan, of which the esthetic works were also a part.\"<ref>Edifying Discourses, Volume III, by Soren Kierkegaard, translated by David F. Swenson, p. V</ref>\n\nSwenson is echoing Kierkegaard's own thoughts here. He wrote the following in ''[[Concluding Unscientific Postscript to Philosophical Fragments]]'', <blockquote>That ''Either/Or'' ends precisely with the upbuilding truth (yet without so much as italicizing the words, to say nothing of didacticizing) was remarkable to me. I could wish to see it emphasized more definitely in order that each particular point on the way to existing Christian-religiously could become clear. The Christian truth as inwardness is also upbuilding, but this by no means implies that every upbuilding truth is Christian; the upbuilding is a wider category. I now concentrated again on this point, but what happened? Just as I intended to begin, ''Two Upbuilding Discourses'' by [[Magister (degree)|Magister]] Kierkegaard, 1843, was published. Then came three upbuilding discourses, and the preface repeated that they were not sermons, which I, if no one else, would indeed have unconditionally protested against, since they use only ethical categories of [[immanence]], not the doubly reflected religious categories in the paradox. If a confusion of language is to be averted, the sermon must be reserved for religious-Christian existence.<ref>Read ''The Absolute Paradox: A Metaphysical Crotchet'' from [[Philosophical Fragments]] for more about what he means. http://www.religion-online.org/showchapter.asp?title=2512&C=2381</ref> p. 256</blockquote>\n \nAnd again in ''[[The Point of View of My Work as an Author]]'',<blockquote>\u201cThe first group of writings represents aesthetic productivity, the last group is exclusively religious: between them, as the turning-point, lies, the Concluding Postscript. This work concerns itself with and sets \u2018the Problem\u2019, which is the problem of the whole authorship, how to become a Christian. So it takes cognizance of the pseudonymous work, and of the eighteen edifying discourses as well, showing that all of this serves to illuminate the Problem-without, however, affirming that this was the aim of the foregoing production, which indeed could not have been affirmed by a pseudonym, a third person, incapable of knowing anything about the aim of a work that was not his own. ''The Concluding Postscript'' is not an aesthetic work, but neither is it in the strictest sense religious. Hence it is by a pseudonym, though I add my name as editor-a thing I did not do in the case of any purely aesthetic work.\u201d p. 13</blockquote>\n\nDavid Jay Gouwens, Professor of Theology at [[Brite Divinity School]],<ref>http://www.brite.tcu.edu/faculty.asp?BriteFaculty=d.gouwens</ref> reminds the reader that Kierkegaard was always more interested in the \"how\" than in the \"why\". He says, Because the \u201chow\u201d is central to Kierkegaard, we must attend closely not only to the pseudonymous literature that has received the bulk of scholarly attention, but also to the series of upbuilding and edifying discourses published currently with the pseudonymous literature, and to what Robert L. Perkins has helpfully termed Kierkegaard\u2019s \u201csecond authorship,\u201d the straightforward religious literature published (with some exceptions) under Kierkegaard\u2019s own name after ''Concluding Unscientific Postscript'' (1846).  It was the edifying discourses in his right hand and his pseudonymous writing in his left, and the public accepted with its right hand the pseudonymous literature in his left, and in its left hand the edifying discourses literature in his right. Although there have been a number of fine studies in recent years that attend to the second literature, there is room for further reflection on the inner logic and character of the upbuilding and \u201csecond literature.\u201d This study is an attempt to contribute to that reflection. What lies behind this is a conviction that finally, the ''audience'' Kierkegaard\u2019s literature addresses consist of not simply, or even first of all, [[philosophers]] or [[Intellectual|literati]] (whether of 19th-century Denmark or today) but persons attempting to be human beings and, perhaps Christians. ''Kierkegaard as religious thinker'', By David Jay Gouwens, p.&nbsp;13\n\n[[File:William Blake - The Soul Exploring the Recesses of the Grave.jpg|thumb|300px|William Blake - ''The Soul Exploring the Recesses of the Grave'' ~ \"The more a person weans his soul from understanding the imperfect to grasping the perfect, the more he will appropriate the explanation of life that comforts while it is day and remains with him when night comes, when he lies forgotten in his grave and has himself forgotten what moth and rust have consumed and human sagacity has found out, and yet he will have a thought that can fill out the long interval for him, that will know nothing of the difference that troubled him but is aware only of the equality that is from above, the equality in love, which lasts and is the only thing that lasts, the equality that does not allow any human being to be another\u2019s debtor, except as Paul says, in the one debt, the debt of loving one another.\" ''Eighteen Upbuilding Discourses'' p. 158]]\nMankind has many different conceptions of what the soul is but one thing they all agree on is that every single individual has a soul and Kierkegaard's view of the matter is that since everyone has a soul all are equal. Is the [[Russian soul]] different from the [[On the Soul|Greek soul]] or from [[The Phenomenology of Spirit|Hegel's soul]] or [[The Souls of Black Folk|W. E. B. Du Bois's]] or is the soul equivalent to the [[Noumenon|mind]] or to the [[Anima mundi|world]]?\n\nEveryone wants to think about it but Keirkegaard wanted to act on a [[A priori and a posteriori|presupposition]] that there is a soul living inside himself and his job was to preserve it. He says, <blockquote>Impatience is an evil spirit that can be expelled only by prayer and much fasting. \u2026 the hunger of impatience is not easy to satisfy-how, then, through fasting? The demands of impatience certainly use many words and long speeches, but in prayer it is very sparing with words. Temporal patience has provisions on hand for a long time, doggedly perseveres, seldom rests, never prays, but Anna continued night and day. Even though impatience says that it is no art to pray-oh, just to collect one\u2019s mind in prayer at a specific time and to pray inwardly, even though for only a moment, is more difficult than to occupy a city, to say nothing of persevering night and day and persevering in prayer in inwardness of heart and the presence of mind and the quietness of thought and the sanction of the whole soul, without being scattered, without being disturbed, without repenting one\u2019s devotion, without anguishing about its being a prinked-up deception, without becoming sick of all one\u2019s praying-but Anna, serving the Lord with prayer and fasting night and day, did not leave the temple. Eighteen Upbuilding Discourses p. 223</blockquote>\n\nKierkegaard wrote the following in an earlier discourse, {{Quotation|The person who loves God is strengthened in the inner being, and the person who loved people, and only through this love learned to love God, has had only an imperfect upbringing, but the person who loved God and in this love learned to love people was strengthened in the inner being.\" ''Eighteen Upbuilding Discourses'', ''Strengthening In The Inner Being'' p. 97}}\n\nHe explained the problem people have in loving human beings in his Journals, {{Quotation|Actually, it is the crime humans consider the greatest and which they punish most cruelly, that of not being like others. It is just this that proves them to be creatures of the animal kingdom. The sparrows rightly peck to death the sparrow which is not like the others, for her the species is higher than the specimens, i.e. sparrows are animals, no more, no less. In respect to what characterizes the human, each is meant on the contrary not to be like the others, to have its peculiarity. Yet human beings forgive every crime except that of being what in their view is to be inhuman-namely to be a human being. ''Soren Kierkegaard: Papers and Journals'', translated with and introduction and notes by [[Alastair Hannay]], 1996. 1848IXA p. 80}}\n\nIn Either/Or he says, {{Quotation|he who has [[humility]] and [[courage]] enough to let himself be esthetically transformed, he who feels himself present as a character in a [[drama]] the [[deity]] is writing, in which the poet and prompter are not different persons, in which the individual, as the experienced actor who has lived into his character and his lines is not disturbed by the prompter but feels that he himself becomes a question whether he is putting the words in the prompter\u2019s mouth or the prompter in his, he who in the most profound sense feels himself creating and created, who in the moment he feels himself [[creativity|creating]] has the original [[Passion (emotion)|pathos]] of the lines and the moment he feels himself created has the erotic ear that picks up every sound-he and he alone has brought into actual existence the highest in esthetics. But this history that proves to be incommensurable even for poetry is the [[Soul|inner history]]. This has the [[idea]] within itself and precisely therefore is the esthetic. Therefore it begins, as I expressed it with the possession, and its progress is the acquiring of this possession. It is an [[eternity]] in which the [[time#Philosophy|temporal]] has not disappeared as an ideal element, but in which it is continually present as a real element. Thus, when patience acquires itself in patience, it is inner history. ''Either/Or II'' p. 137-138}}\n\n[[Howard V. Hong]] says in the introduction to his translation of the discourses, \"According to the usual ways of reckoning the impact of a book-reviews and sales-the six small volumes of upbuilding discourses were scarcely a smashing success. ... The sales of the six volumes matched the paucity and brevity of the reviews of the discourses. ... when [Kierkegaard] ran out of the first two discourses, he  bound the sixteen discourses in a volume under the common title ''Sexten opyggelige Taler'' (''Sixteen Upbuilding Discourses''). ... 78 copies of the two discourses (1843 and 61 copies of the three discourses (1843) were [[Remaindered book|remaindered]], a copy of ''Sexten opyggelige Taler'' must be the rarest Kierkegaard book in existence. ... they and later discourses were obliged to wait a hundred years for the acclaim given to them by [[Martin Heidegger]].<ref>Eighteen Upbuilding Discourses, Hong, xxi-xxii</ref>\n\nSwenson wrote in 1941, \"While Kierkegaard has long been recognized in continental Europe as one of the world's foremost thinkers, it is only recently that he is coming to be known by the English-reading public. His first work to be translated into English, the [[Philosophical Fragments]], appeared only five years ago. Since then some eight or ten of his more important books have been published in English, with a prospect for more in the future. As a result of this tardy recognition, English interpretations of Kierkegaard's thought and commentaries concerning it, have been practically non-existent, a condition which is bound to alter rapidly as he becomes better known, since his ideas are not only thought-provoking but frequently controversial in content.<ref>''Something about Kierkegaard'', By David Swenson ''Foreword''</ref>\n\n== Notes ==\n<references group=\"note\"/>\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== Sources ==\n\n=== Primary sources ===\n* [https://books.google.com/books/princeton?id=djbs3UhrjIIC&printsec=frontcover&dq=kierkegaard&lr=&cd=11#v=onepage&q&f=false ''Eighteen Upbuilding Discourses''], by Soren Kierkegaard, Princeton University Press.

These discourses were translated from Danish to English in the 1940s, and from Danish to German in the 1950s, and then to English again in 1990. These Discourses were published along with Kierkegaard's pseudonymous works.\n\nScholars generally say that \"Kierkegaard's books were of two kinds. There was a series of books ascribed to [[pseudonym]]s, which Kierkegaard described as \"aesthetic\" in character. In ''[[Either/Or]]'', ''[[Fear and Trembling]]'', and [[Repetition (Kierkegaard)|''Repetition'']], Kierkegaard explores the nature of human [[Passion (emotion)|passion]]s in a variety of forms, often presenting his own experiences in a [[poetry|poetically]] disguised [[narrative]]\". The pseudonymous books as well as his discourses are understood to be directed to the love of his life, Regine Olsen. \"He hoped to reveal himself at last to [[Regine Olsen|Regine]] in this \"indirect\" manner. At the same time that these [[aesthetic]] writings were being published, Kierkegaard wrote a series of edifying, [[sermon]] like essays, although he was careful to insist that they were not sermons, in part because he had not been [[ordained]] and therefore lacked \"authority.\" Through these he communicated his underlying religious commitments in a more \"direct\" fashion. Kierkegaard continued to write these \"edifying discourses\" throughout his life, but as he grew older they focused on more distinctively [[Christianity|Christian]] themes and took on a decidedly sharper tone.\"<ref>''Soren Kierkegaard's Christian Psychology: Insight for Counseling and Pastoral Care'' By C. Stephen Evans, Regent College Publishing, 1995  p. 16</ref>\n \nKierkegaard says individuals are \"squeezed into the forms of actuality\"{{refn|He talks about the possibility of freedom from becoming the product of actuality by choosing yourself. Here is the complete quote from ''Either/Or'': \"As a product he is squeezed into the forms of actuality; in the choice he makes himself elastic, transforms everything exterior into interiority. He has his place in the world; in freedom he himself chooses his place-that is he chooses this place. He is a specific individual; in the choice he makes himself into a specific individual; namely, into the same one, because he chooses himself. An individual thus chooses himself as a complex specific concretion and therefore chooses himself in his [http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/continuity continuity]. This concretion is the individual\u2019s actuality, but since he chooses it according to his freedom, it may also be said that it is his possibility or, in order not to use such an [http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/aesthetic aesthetic] expression, it is his task. In other words, the person who lives esthetically has only possibilities everywhere; for him these make up the content of future time, whereas the person who lives [http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/ethically ethically] sees tasks everywhere. Then the individual sees this, his actual concretion, as tasks, as goal, as objective. But in seeing his possibility as his task, the individual expresses precisely his sovereignty over himself, something he never surrenders, even though on the other hand he does not relish the very [http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/constrain constrained] sovereignty that a king without a county always has. This gives the ethical person a [http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/security security] that the person who lives esthetically lacks altogether. The person who lives esthetically expects everything from the outside. This accounts for the sickly anxiety with which many people speak of the dreadfulness of not having found their place in the world. Who will deny the joy in having made a good catch in this respect, but such an anxiety always indicates that the individual expects everything from the place, nothing from himself. The person who lives ethically will also be careful about choosing his place properly, but if he detects that he has made a mistake, or if obstacles are raised that are beyond his control, he does not lose heart, for he does not surrender sovereignty over himself. He promptly sees his task and therefore is in action without delay. ''Either/Or Part 2'', Hong p. 251-252|group=\"note\"}} but that they have a choice as to what form they will put on. He says \"the transition made in ''Either/Or'' is substantially that from a poet-existence to an ethical existence.<ref>''Point of View'', Lowrie, Note: p. 74</ref>\n\nHe \"held out Either/Or to the world in his left hand, and in his right he held the [[Two Upbuilding Discourses, 1843|Two Edifying Discourses]]; but all, or as good as all, grasped with their right what he held in his left hand. Kierkegaard wrote in 1848, \u201cI had made up my mind before God what I should do: I staked my case on the Two Edifying Discourses; but I understood perfectly that only very few understood them. And here for the first time comes in the category \u2018that individual' who with joy and gratitude I call ''my reader''.\u2019 A stereo typed formula which was repeated in the Preface to every collection of Edifying Discourses.<ref>Point of View p. 19-20</ref> Now he holds out these two discourses of 1844 with his right hand and hopes for better results. He says in his dedication to \"that single individual', <blockquote>Although this little book (which is called \u201cdiscourses\u2019, not sermons, because its author does not have authority to preach; \u201cupbuilding discourses,\u201d not discourses for upbuilding, because the speaker by no means claims to be a teacher) has left out something, it nevertheless has forgotten nothing; although it is not without hope in the world, it nevertheless totally renounces all hope in the uncertain or of the uncertain. Tempted, perhaps, as the earlier ones were not, it takes no delight in \u201cgoing to the house of feasting,\u201d desires as little as they \u201cthat its visit might be in vain\u201d (I Thessalonians 2:1); even though a person was not without education insofar as he learned from what he suffered, it still would never be very pleasant if he needed to suffer much in order to learn little. Its desire is to give thanks if on the word of authority it were to win the tacit permission of the multitude to dare to go its way unnoticed in order to find what it seeks: that single individual whom I with joy and gratitude call my reader, who with the right hand accepts what is offered with the right hand; that single individual who at the opportune time takes out what he received and hides what he took out until he takes it out again and thus by his good will, his wisdom, invests the humble gift to the benefit and joy of one who continually desires only to be as one absent on a journey.

You may have heard it from those who were there with him, who with sadness, but also deeply moved, had to confess that in those few hours he had lived more than in all the rest of his life, more than is lived in years and days as people ordinarily live.\"<ref name=\"EUDp181\">''Eighteen Upbuilding Discourses'', Hong p. 181</ref>\n\nHe provides examples of how different people react to danger and [[anxiety]]. He regards the single individual very highly and says, \"Let us praise what is truly praiseworthy, the glory of human nature; let us give thanks that it was granted also to us to be [[human]] [[beings]].\"<ref name=\"EUDp182\">''Eighteen Upbuilding Discourses'', Hong p. 182</ref>\n\nKierkegaard provides three examples of people reacting to anxiety and despair, all of them as praiseworthy as the physical endurance to defeat an external enemy. Both have been important factors since the publication of [[Either/Or]]. he writes,\n\nOne person \"surveyed everything and the horrifying situation, how quickly presence of mind assuredly chose the right thing as if it were the fruit of the most mature reflection, how the will, even the eyes, defied the threatening terrors, how the body did not even feel the exertion, the agonizing suffering, how the arms lightly carried the burden that far exceeded human strength, how the feet stood firm where others did not dare to look down because they saw the abyss!\"<ref name=\"EUDp181\"/>\n\nWhile another \"person discovered a danger while all speak of peace and security, if he discerned the horror and after having used the healthiest power of his soul to make himself fully aware of it, again with the horror before his eyes, now developed and preserved the same strength of soul as the one who fought in peril of his life, the same inwardness as the one who fought with death-yes, then we shall praise him.\"<ref name=\"EUDp182\"/>\n\nAnother \"with troubled [[imagination]] conjured up anxieties he was unable to surmount, while he still could not leave off staring at them, evoking them ever more alarmingly, pondering them ever more fearfully, then we shall not praise him, even though we praise the wonderful glory of human nature. But if he [[Psychotherapy|brought out the horror and detected the mortal danger]], without any thought of providing people, by pointless talk, with subject matter for pointless pondering, but grasped that the danger had to do with himself-if, then, with this in mind, he won the strength of soul that horror gives, this would in truth be praiseworthy, would in truth be wondrously wonderful.\"<ref name=\"EUDp183\">''Eighteen Upbuilding Discourses'', Hong p. 183</ref>\n[[File:Rembrandt - Balaam.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Patience has another phrase, a powerful phrase, just what the anxious one needs. (...) Let us regard patience as an angel of deliverance who stands there with his flaming sword, and every time the soul is about to rush out to the outermost boundary of despair it must pass by him; he judges the soul but also strengthens it. (...) he soberly turns them back and says: Take courage; I am standing here, I never doze off; go home again, prepare your souls in patience and quiet alertness.<ref>''Eighteen Upbuilding Discourses'', Hong p. 200-201</ref>]]\n\nThis act of self-discovery is the essence of what Kierkegaard wrote about. He says, \"People are prone to pay attention to earthly dangers<ref name=\"EUDp183\"/> but these are external dangers. Kierkegaard says, we need to preserve something internal; our souls.\"<ref>''Eighteen Upbuilding Discourses'', Hong p. 185 compare [[Plato's tripartite theory of soul]]</ref> He explains himself, <blockquote>Just as there is only one means<ref>means in this case means the same as way, so it could read, there is only one way for preserving it- ''Editor''</ref> for preserving it, so is this means necessary even in order to [[understanding|understand]] that it must be preserved, and if this were not the case, the means would not be the only means. This means is patience. A person does not first gain his soul and then have the need for patience to preserve it, but he gains it in no other way than by preserving it, and therefore patience is the first and patience is the last, precisely because patience is just as active as it is passive and just as passive as it is active. ''Eighteen Upbuilding Discourses'', Hong p. 187</blockquote>\n\nThere are two paths people take in life. The path of patience or the path of impatience. Kierkegaard puts it so well, {{Quotation|<blockquote>Then the young person went on his way, and patience repeated its promise not to abandon him if he would keep to it. His path was delightful, his walking was easy, and not at all as his fatherly friend patience had taught him it would be. The young people joined him enthusiastically; the elderly turned and looked wistfully after him. So quickly did he go that he even left expectancy behind him without missing it, because fortune followed his steps, advancement his deeds, success his plans. His gold procured everything for him, even the service of envy; his favor was the price that bought everything, even the applause of his rivals. His plans became bolder; even fortune became so happy about them that in order to contend with him it became bolder and bolder. Patience called to him in vain; when at every moment there is a world to win-something patience, in fact, had never spoken of-then patience can well wait until tomorrow. Then he stood on the pinnacle-proudly he gazed downward. He was nauseated by all of it, by the glitter of gold, by the vanity of pleasure, by the cowardliness of men-[[Market (economics)|everything, in fact, was for sale]], everything. Was it fortune that had made him impatient? It certainly had indulged him in everything; it would still indulge him, and nevertheless he languished in the cold heart of impatience. ''Eighteen Upbuilding Discourses'' p. 194-195</blockquote>}}\n\n<blockquote>Does not patience perceive that the greatest danger is that the [[anxiety|elucidating understanding\u2019s fears]] prove not to be the case, for then not even patience could comfort anymore? Now it can, if only the sick one so desires, since the danger is whether the sick one is to be allowed to emancipate himself from the eternal, to wither away in [[common sense|commonsensicality]], to expire in callousness, to be desouled in spiritlessness. And against this danger there is still a resource. He who, believing, continues to aspire to the eternal never becomes satiated in such a way that he does not continue blessedly to hunger; he who [[optimism|hopefully looks to the future]] can never be [[pessimist|petrified at some moment by the past]], because he always turns his back to it; he who loves God and human beings still continually has enough to do, even when need is the greatest and [[Existentialism#Despair|despair]] is most imminent. Before he lies down to die, he asks once again: Do I love God just as much as before, and do I love the common concerns of human beings? If he dares to answer in the affirmative, then he does not die or he dies saved; if he dare not, then he certainly has enough to do. Then in love and for the sake of his love he must [[thought|deliberate]] whether it is not possible to see, to glimpse, to presage the joy and comfort that still must hide in the sadness, since this must still truly serve him for good. ''Eighteen Upbuilding Discourses'' p. 198-199</blockquote>\n\n=== Patience in Expectation ===\n[[File:Rembrandt Harmensz. van Rijn 056.jpg|thumb|250px|Is Anna not patient in her expectancy? Even though in the world we hear at times of someone who expects nothing at all, even though such a person is sometimes thought to have attained the proper assurance, because he craftily made it impossible for himself to discern the loss, yet it is also admitted that this wisdom is of later origin, and that no one has it in early youth. Originally, like every other human being he was expectant. With a smile or with tears, one confesses that expectancy is in the soul originally. ''Eighteen Upbuilding Discourses'', Patience in Expectation, p. 220]]\n\nKierkegaard's intention in the preceding discourse was to speak as if patience were outside a person. He says, \"we are well aware that this is not so. And nevertheless I ask you, you who know better how to praise it than I, know better how to accomplish the good, how to commend it to people, since you have known it better, more inwardly and for a longer time-was it nevertheless not so at times, when concern and your laboring thoughts piled up deliberations that were of no benefit except to give birth to new deliberations, that then the plain, simple, but nevertheless forgotten words of patience prodded you from another direction, was it not as if patience stool on the outside? We have made it appear as if patience were outside, and we have let it speak, as it were, for itself.\"<ref>''Eighteen Upbuilding Discourses'' p. 202</ref>\n\nNow he brings out a real person, just as he did in ''Either/Or'' (A and B), in ''Fear and Trembling'' (Abraham), and in ''Repetition'' (the Young Man and Constantin Constanius). He brings out [[Anna (Bible)|Anna]] and focuses primarily on her and her expectancy. What he drives home is that God is the constant that remains the same, whereas everything else changes. What he exhorts us to is to love God in such a way that our nature might be like his, that we might gain God in constancy and rescue our soul in patience.<ref>''Eighteen Upbuilding Discourses'' p. 40</ref>\n\nWhat is it about expectancy that it either blesses or curses the single individual? Kierkegaard says, \"How often it is said that no one is to be considered happy until he is dead, but how seldom is a troubled person heard to say that one should not give up as long as one is living, that there is hope as long as there is life-and consequently there is always hope for the immortal who expect an eternity.\"<ref name=\"EUDp214\">''Eighteen Upbuilding Discourses'' p. 214</ref> His advice to the person who believes that their past life has destroyed all expectancy is to: \u201cForget the past once again, quit all this calculating in which you trap yourself, do not stop the prompting of your heart, do not extinguish the spirit in useless quarreling about who waited the longest and suffered the most-once again cast all your sorrow upon the Lord and throw yourself upon his love. Up out of this sea, expectancy rises reborn again and sees heaven open-reborn, no newborn, for this heavenly expectancy begins precisely when the [[Either/Or#Equilibrium between the Aesthetic and the Ethical in the Development of Personality|earthly expectancy sinks down powerless and in despair]].\u201d<ref name=\"EUDp214\"/>\n\nBut the expectant person should always remember that \"every time he catches his soul not expecting victory, he knows he does not have faith.\"<ref>''Eighteen Upbuilding Discourses'' p. 27</ref> Anna had a choice, the same as everyone has, and used it. Kierkegaard says, {{Quotation|Her [[choice]] is made. It did not happen yesterday or the day before yesterday so that we should be ready with our assistance to get it changed. Her choice is made, and if she has regretted it, the time of regret has been long. She chose to remain faithful to her late husband, as he had been faithful to her, or to say it another and more truthful way, even though it might not seem as beautiful to her, she chose to remain [[Authenticity (philosophy)|true to herself]]; after all, every external bond was dissolved, and only that love bound her in which she had her [[Free will|freedom]] and without which she would not have known herself again. In this fidelity, her life became very poor in variety, which some people achieve to the point of repulsiveness, but her life became fruitful for the eternal. And whatever you may think of this, my listener, it is certainly [[Liberty|up to each individual to decide on his own]], so that according to circumstances one choice may be just as commendable in its fervent love as another, but this much is certain-that the woman who is busy consoling herself over the loss of her late husband is hardly God\u2019s choice to appear as a witness of expectancy in the hour when the [[Nativity of Jesus|expectancy of the human race has its fulfillment]]. ''Eighteen Upbuilding Discourses'' p. 209-210}}\n\n== Criticism ==\nThese upbuilding discourses were translated edifying discourses by [[David F. Swenson (translator)|David F. Swenson]] when he translated them in the mid-1940s. He wrote the following in his [[preface]] to this discourse. \"The discourses appearing in the present volume constitute the fourth and fifth groups in the series of eighteen devotional addresses, and both groups were published in 1844. It may be of some interest to consider more particularly than has hitherto been done, the plan and purpose of these productions, paralleling as they do in time of publication the publication of the esthetic works. Unlike the latter, these addresses were published under Kierkegaard's own name, because as religious works he assumed personal responsibility for the views expressed, since their purpose was to indicate that from the beginning his writing had a religious motivation and plan, of which the esthetic works were also a part.\"<ref>Edifying Discourses, Volume III, by Soren Kierkegaard, translated by David F. Swenson, p. V</ref>\n\nSwenson is echoing Kierkegaard's own thoughts here. He wrote the following in ''[[Concluding Unscientific Postscript to Philosophical Fragments]]'', <blockquote>That ''Either/Or'' ends precisely with the upbuilding truth (yet without so much as italicizing the words, to say nothing of didacticizing) was remarkable to me. I could wish to see it emphasized more definitely in order that each particular point on the way to existing Christian-religiously could become clear. The Christian truth as inwardness is also upbuilding, but this by no means implies that every upbuilding truth is Christian; the upbuilding is a wider category. I now concentrated again on this point, but what happened? Just as I intended to begin, ''Two Upbuilding Discourses'' by [[Magister (degree)|Magister]] Kierkegaard, 1843, was published. Then came three upbuilding discourses, and the preface repeated that they were not sermons, which I, if no one else, would indeed have unconditionally protested against, since they use only ethical categories of [[immanence]], not the doubly reflected religious categories in the paradox. If a confusion of language is to be averted, the sermon must be reserved for religious-Christian existence.<ref>Read ''The Absolute Paradox: A Metaphysical Crotchet'' from [[Philosophical Fragments]] for more about what he means. http://www.religion-online.org/showchapter.asp?title=2512&C=2381</ref> p. 256</blockquote>\n \nAnd again in ''[[The Point of View of My Work as an Author]]'',<blockquote>\u201cThe first group of writings represents aesthetic productivity, the last group is exclusively religious: between them, as the turning-point, lies, the Concluding Postscript. This work concerns itself with and sets \u2018the Problem\u2019, which is the problem of the whole authorship, how to become a Christian. So it takes cognizance of the pseudonymous work, and of the eighteen edifying discourses as well, showing that all of this serves to illuminate the Problem-without, however, affirming that this was the aim of the foregoing production, which indeed could not have been affirmed by a pseudonym, a third person, incapable of knowing anything about the aim of a work that was not his own. ''The Concluding Postscript'' is not an aesthetic work, but neither is it in the strictest sense religious. Hence it is by a pseudonym, though I add my name as editor-a thing I did not do in the case of any purely aesthetic work.\u201d p. 13</blockquote>\n\nDavid Jay Gouwen, Professor of Theology at [[Brite Divinity School]],<ref>http://www.brite.tcu.edu/faculty.asp?BriteFaculty=d.gouwens</ref> reminds the reader that Kierkegaard was always more interested in the \"how\" than in the \"why\". He says, Because the \u201chow\u201d is central to Kierkegaard, we must attend closely not only to the pseudonymous literature that has received the bulk of scholarly attention, but also to the series of upbuilding and edifying discourses published currently with the pseudonymous literature, and to what Robert L. Perkins has helpfully termed Kierkegaard\u2019s \u201csecond authorship,\u201d the straightforward religious literature published (with some exceptions) under Kierkegaard\u2019s own name after ''Concluding Unscientific Postscript'' (1846).  It was the edifying discourses in his right hand and his pseudonymous writing in his left, and the public accepted with its right hand the pseudonymous literature in his left, and in its left hand the edifying discourses literature in his right. Although there have been a number of fine studies in recent years that attend to the second literature, there is room for further reflection on the inner logic and character of the upbuilding and \u201csecond literature.\u201d This study is an attempt to contribute to that reflection. What lies behind this is a conviction that finally, the ''audience'' Kierkegaard\u2019s literature addresses consist of not simply, or even first of all, [[philosophers]] or [[Intellectual|literati]] (whether of 19th-century Denmark or today) but persons attempting to be human beings and, perhaps Christians. ''Kierkegaard as religious thinker'', By David Jay Gouwen, p.&nbsp;13\n\n[[File:William Blake - The Soul Exploring the Recesses of the Grave.jpg|thumb|300px|William Blake - ''The Soul Exploring the Recesses of the Grave'' ~ \"The more a person weans his soul from understanding the imperfect to grasping the perfect, the more he will appropriate the explanation of life that comforts while it is day and remains with him when night comes, when he lies forgotten in his grave and has himself forgotten what moth and rust have consumed and human sagacity has found out, and yet he will have a thought that can fill out the long interval for him, that will know nothing of the difference that troubled him but is aware only of the equality that is from above, the equality in love, which lasts and is the only thing that lasts, the equality that does not allow any human being to be another\u2019s debtor, except as Paul says, in the one debt, the debt of loving one another.\" ''Eighteen Upbuilding Discourses'' p. 158]]\nMankind has many different conceptions of what the soul is but one thing they all agree on is that every single individual has a soul and Kierkegaard's view of the matter is that since everyone has a soul all are equal. Is the [[Russian soul]] different from the [[On the Soul|Greek soul]] or from [[The Phenomenology of Spirit|Hegel's soul]] or [[The Souls of Black Folk|W. E. B. Du Bois's]] or is the soul equivalent to the [[Noumenon|mind]] or to the [[Anima mundi|world]]?\n\nEveryone wants to think about it but Keirkegaard wanted to act on a [[A priori and a posteriori|presupposition]] that there is a soul living inside himself and his job was to preserve it. He says, <blockquote>Impatience is an evil spirit that can be expelled only by prayer and much fasting. \u2026 the hunger of impatience is not easy to satisfy-how, then, through fasting? The demands of impatience certainly use many words and long speeches, but in prayer it is very sparing with words. Temporal patience has provisions on hand for a long time, doggedly perseveres, seldom rests, never prays, but Anna continued night and day. Even though impatience says that it is no art to pray-oh, just to collect one\u2019s mind in prayer at a specific time and to pray inwardly, even though for only a moment, is more difficult than to occupy a city, to say nothing of persevering night and day and persevering in prayer in inwardness of heart and the presence of mind and the quietness of thought and the sanction of the whole soul, without being scattered, without being disturbed, without repenting one\u2019s devotion, without anguishing about its being a prinked-up deception, without becoming sick of all one\u2019s praying-but Anna, serving the Lord with prayer and fasting night and day, did not leave the temple. Eighteen Upbuilding Discourses p. 223</blockquote>\n\nKierkegaard wrote the following in an earlier discourse, {{Quotation|The person who loves God is strengthened in the inner being, and the person who loved people, and only through this love learned to love God, has had only an imperfect upbringing, but the person who loved God and in this love learned to love people was strengthened in the inner being.\" ''Eighteen Upbuilding Discourses'', ''Strengthening In The Inner Being'' p. 97}}\n\nHe explained the problem people have in loving human beings in his Journals, {{Quotation|Actually, it is the crime humans consider the greatest and which they punish most cruelly, that of not being like others. It is just this that proves them to be creatures of the animal kingdom. The sparrows rightly peck to death the sparrow which is not like the others, for her the species is higher than the specimens, i.e. sparrows are animals, no more, no less. In respect to what characterizes the human, each is meant on the contrary not to be like the others, to have its peculiarity. Yet human beings forgive every crime except that of being what in their view is to be inhuman-namely to be a human being. ''Soren Kierkegaard: Papers and Journals'', translated with and introduction and notes by [[Alastair Hannay]], 1996. 1848IXA p. 80}}\n\nIn Either/Or he says, {{Quotation|he who has [[humility]] and [[courage]] enough to let himself be esthetically transformed, he who feels himself present as a character in a [[drama]] the [[deity]] is writing, in which the poet and prompter are not different persons, in which the individual, as the experienced actor who has lived into his character and his lines is not disturbed by the prompter but feels that he himself becomes a question whether he is putting the words in the prompter\u2019s mouth or the prompter in his, he who in the most profound sense feels himself creating and created, who in the moment he feels himself [[creativity|creating]] has the original [[Passion (emotion)|pathos]] of the lines and the moment he feels himself created has the erotic ear that picks up every sound-he and he alone has brought into actual existence the highest in esthetics. But this history that proves to be incommensurable even for poetry is the [[Soul|inner history]]. This has the [[idea]] within itself and precisely therefore is the esthetic. Therefore it begins, as I expressed it with the possession, and its progress is the acquiring of this possession. It is an [[eternity]] in which the [[time#Philosophy|temporal]] has not disappeared as an ideal element, but in which it is continually present as a real element. Thus, when patience acquires itself in patience, it is inner history. ''Either/Or II'' p. 137-138}}\n\n[[Howard V. Hong]] says in the introduction to his translation of the discourses, \"According to the usual ways of reckoning the impact of a book-reviews and sales-the six small volumes of upbuilding discourses were scarcely a smashing success. ... The sales of the six volumes matched the paucity and brevity of the reviews of the discourses. ... when [Kierkegaard] ran out of the first two discourses, he  bound the sixteen discourses in a volume under the common title ''Sexten opyggelige Taler'' (''Sixteen Upbuilding Discourses''). ... 78 copies of the two discourses (1843 and 61 copies of the three discourses (1843) were [[Remaindered book|remaindered]], a copy of ''Sexten opyggelige Taler'' must be the rarest Kierkegaard book in existence. ... they and later discourses were obliged to wait a hundred years for the acclaim given to them by [[Martin Heidegger]].<ref>Eighteen Upbuilding Discourses, Hong, xxi-xxii</ref>\n\nSwenson wrote in 1941, \"While Kierkegaard has long been recognized in continental Europe as one of the world's foremost thinkers, it is only recently that he is coming to be known by the English-reading public. His first work to be translated into English, the [[Philosophical Fragments]], appeared only five years ago. Since then some eight or ten of his more important books have been published in English, with a prospect for more in the future. As a result of this tardy recognition, English interpretations of Kierkegaard's thought and commentaries concerning it, have been practically non-existent, a condition which is bound to alter rapidly as he becomes better known, since his ideas are not only thought-provoking but frequently controversial in content.<ref>''Something about Kierkegaard'', By David Swenson ''Foreword''</ref>\n\n== Notes ==\n<references group=\"note\"/>\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== Sources ==\n\n=== Primary sources ===\n* [https://books.google.com/books/princeton?id=djbs3UhrjIIC&printsec=frontcover&dq=kierkegaard&lr=&cd=11#v=onepage&q&f=false ''Eighteen Upbuilding Discourses''], by Soren Kierkegaard, Princeton University Press.
