The race date will move to March 22, 2020, following the race at Atlanta. This will be Fox Sports' first time carrying the event.\n*After 21 years of being NASCAR's Fourth of July weekend event (and 60 of 61 years overall), the [[Coke Zero Sugar 400]] at [[Daytona International Speedway]] will move to August and become the final race of NASCAR's \"regular season\". The [[Brickyard 400]], run at [[Indianapolis Motor Speedway]], will switch race weekends with Daytona.\n*The [[Blue-Emu Maximum Pain Relief 500]] at [[Martinsville Speedway]] will be run under the lights for the first time on May 9, Mother's Day Weekend.\n*[[Kansas Speedway]]'s spring race, the [[Digital Ally 400]] that has been run under the lights on [[Mother's Day]] Weekend will move from Saturday night to Sunday afternoon and be held on May 31, 2020, after the [[Coca-Cola 600]].\n*Both events at [[Pocono Raceway]] will be run on consecutive days the weekend of June 27\u201328.\n*[[Dover International Speedway]]'s second date moves to late August, marking the first time the race has not been in NASCAR's postseason. \n*The [[Toyota/Save Mart 350]] will move one week earlier than 2018.\n*The [[Southern 500]] at [[Darlington Raceway]] will be held as the first race of the Playoffs, as the [[South Point 400]] at [[Las Vegas Motor Speedway]] will move to the first race of the Round of 12.

The race date will move to March 22, 2020, following the race at Atlanta. This will be Fox Sports' first time carrying the event.\n*After 21 years of being NASCAR's Fourth of July weekend event (and 60 of 61 years overall), the [[Coke Zero Sugar 400]] at [[Daytona International Speedway]] will move to August and become the final race of NASCAR's \"regular season\". The [[Brickyard 400]], run at [[Indianapolis Motor Speedway]], will switch race weekends with Daytona.\n*The [[Blue-Emu Maximum Pain Relief 500]] at [[Martinsville Speedway]] will be run under the lights for the first time on May 9, Mother's Day Weekend.\n*[[Kansas Speedway]]'s spring race, the [[Digital Ally 400]] that has been run under the lights on [[Mother's Day]] Weekend will move from Saturday night to Sunday afternoon and be held on May 31, 2020, after the [[Coca-Cola 600]].\n*Both events at [[Pocono Raceway]] will be run on consecutive days the weekend of June 27\u201328.\n*[[Dover International Speedway]]'s second date moves to late August, marking the first time the race has not been in NASCAR's postseason. \n*The [[Toyota/Save Mart 350]] will move one week earlier than 2018.\n*The [[Southern 500]] at [[Darlington Raceway]] will be held as the first race of the Playoffs, as the [[South Point 400]] at [[Las Vegas Motor Speedway]] will move to the first race of the Round of 12.
