From 1898 he was also  [[Dublin City Marshal]].\n\n==Biography==\nJohn Howard Parnell was the fifth child of [[John Henry Parnell]] of [[Avondale House|Avondale]], [[Co. Wicklow]] and of his wife Delia, daughter of [[Charles Stewart (1778\u20131869)|Commodore Charles Stewart]] of the [[US Navy]]. They met when the twenty year old John Henry Parnell, now owner of Collure in Armagh and Clonmore in Carlow, decided, after the death of his father, to go on a long tour in America and Mexico with his cousin, Lord Powerscourt. Soon after they arrived in America they met in Washington Delia Tudor Stewart, a girl of seventeen, conspicuous in the social and political life of the city. In 1834 they were married in New York, and returned to Ireland.<ref>Parnell, John Howard. ''Charles Stewart Parnell''</ref>\n\nJohn Howard Parnell was educated in [[Paris]], [[Chipping Norton, Oxfordshire|Chipping Norton]] and School of Mining where he was awarded a certificate in Geology. At some point he joined the Armagh Light Infantry.<ref>O\u2019Brien, R. Barry. ''Life of Charles Stewart Parnell'', vol.I</ref> Due to the terms of the bequest to the family, it was the younger son Charles who inherited the family estate of Avondale when their father died in 1859, while John inherited another estate in [[County Armagh|Armagh]].\n\nJohn Howard Parnell was the first of the two brothers to stand for Parliament. He sought election as a [[Home Rule League|Home Rule]] candidate for [[Wicklow (UK Parliament constituency)|Co. Wicklow]] in the [[1874 United Kingdom general election|general election of 1874]], but was unsuccessful. After this he went to [[Chambers County, Alabama|Chambers County]], [[Alabama]], United States,<ref>[http://www.askaboutireland.ie/reading-room/digital-book-collection/digital-books-by-subject/irish-people/parnell-charles-stuart-pa/ \"Parnell: Charles Stewart Parnell: A Memoir\", Ask About Ireland]</ref> where he was a cotton-grower and. later, a pioneering peach farmer, establishing the {{convert|700|acre|km2|adj=on}} Sunny South Fruit Farm. He also founded the first Catholic congregation in that part of the state, now the Holy Family Catholic Church in [[Lanett, Alabama]]. (Quinlan-2004)\n\nParnell returned to Ireland when he inherited Avondale on Charles's death in October 1891, against the wishes of his brother, who had wanted to leave it to his wife [[Katharine O'Shea|Katharine (n\u00e9e Wood)]]. He found the estate heavily mortgaged and eventually sold it in 1899 and five years later, at the suggestion of [[Horace Plunkett]] it was purchased by the State. It is open to public view, the local town [[Rathdrum, County Wicklow]] the location of  the \"Parnell National Memorial Park\".\n\nBy this time the [[Irish Parliamentary Party]] had split over his brother's leadership, and John Howard Parnell stood unsuccessfully for [[West Wicklow (UK Parliament constituency)|West Wicklow]] as a Parnellite in [[1892 United Kingdom general election|1892]].  However, he was successful as a Parnellite in [[South Meath (UK Parliament constituency)|South Meath]] in [[1895 United Kingdom general election|1895]], narrowly defeating the sitting anti-Parnellite [[Jeremiah Jordan]] by 43 votes. He intended to stand again at the [[1900 United Kingdom general election|general election of 1900]], but lost the seat unexpectedly. [[James Laurence Carew|J. L. Carew]], a former Parnellite turned [[Healyite]], was under attack in his own constituency of [[Dublin College Green (UK Parliament constituency)|Dublin College Green]] because he had attended a royal function. On nomination day, Carew was nominated for South Meath. Parnell had expected no opposition and had not brought the fees necessary for nomination in a contested election. Carew was therefore returned unopposed. Carew subsequently stated in a letter to the press that his return was secured without his knowledge or consent, and offered to resign in favour of Parnell or any other candidate nominated by the constituency. However he was defeated at College Green and did not resign South Meath.\n\nOn Carew's death in 1903, John Howard Parnell did not secure the official Irish Parliamentary Party nomination for South Meath. He contested the seat as an independent Nationalist, but was defeated by the official Irish Parliamentary Party candidate [[David Sheehy]] by more than two to one.\n\nHe made a late marriage, in 1907, to Olivia Isabella Smythe, daughter of Colonel James Smythe and widow of Archibald Matier of Carlingford.\n\nJohn Howard Parnell died on 3 May 1923 and was buried in [[Deans Grange Cemetery]].\n\nIn his obituary in 1923, ''The Times'' commented that John \"was like his brother in appearance, but differed from him in every other respect.  He never spoke in the House of Commons, and was far better known in the members\u2019 chess room\".  His memoir of his more famous brother is an important source for the latter's biography. He was a member of ''Sackville Chess Club'' and competed for them in the [[Armstrong Cup]].\n\n==Legacy==\nJohn Howard Parnell is mentioned in [[James Joyce]]'s ''[[Ulysses (novel)|Ulysses]]'', where Bloom sees him wandering the streets in \"Lestrygonians,\" and again in \"Wandering Rocks\".<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=2iQABAAAQBAJ&pg=PA59&lpg=PA59&dq=john+howard+parnell&source=bl&ots=tAlST7Js4u&sig=i8i_cxoy-caX61Bayy95K_W7D44&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0CCAQ6AEwATgUahUKEwiypZnKvprHAhXMPz4KHTNwBuI#v=onepage&q=john%20howard%20parnell&f=false McMichael, James.

It has qualities in common with both the original 3\u00d73\u00d73 Rubik's Cube and the 4\u00d74\u00d74 [[Rubik's Revenge]], and knowing how to solve either can help when working on the 5\u00d75\u00d75 cube.\n\n==History==\n[[File:Rubik's Wahn(5x5x5)origArxon Wiki.jpg|thumb|right|Professor's Cube in original packaging]]\n[[File:V-Cube 5 in Package.jpg|thumb|right|The V-Cube 5 in original packaging]]\nThe 5\u00d75\u00d75 cube was created by Udo Krell in 1981. Out of many designs that were proposed, Udo Krell's design was the first 5\u00d75\u00d75 design that was manufactured and sold. [[Uwe M\u00e8ffert]] manufactured the cube and sold it in [[Hong Kong]] in 1983.\n\n[[Ideal Toy Company|Ideal Toys]] marketed the 5x5x5 cube in [[Germany]] as the \"Rubik's Wahn\" (Wahn meaning delusion or illusion). The 5\u00d75\u00d75 cube got its name when the cube was marketed in [[Japan]] under the name \"Professor's Cube\". M\u00e8ffert reissued the cube under the name \"Professor's Cube\" in the 1990s. <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.speedsolving.com/wiki/index.php/5x5x5_Cube|title=5x5x5 Wiki|last=|first=|date=|website=Speedsolving.com|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\nEarly versions of the 5\u00d75\u00d75 cube sold at [[Barnes & Noble]] were marketed under the name \"Professor's Cube\" but currently, Barnes and Noble sells cubes that are simply called \"5\u00d75.\" Mefferts.com offers a limited edition version of the 5\u00d75\u00d75 cube called the Professor's Cube. This version has colored tiles rather than stickers.<ref>[http://www.mefferts.com/products/details.php?lang=en&category=13&id=238 Meffert's Professor's Cube]</ref> Verdes Innovations sells a version called the V-Cube 5.<ref>[http://www.v-cubes.com/prod_info/v-cube5.php Verdes' Innovations V-Cube 5 page] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100327224620/http://www.v-cubes.com/prod_info/v-cube5.php |date=2010-03-27 }}</ref>\n\n==Workings==\n[[File:Professors cube.jpg|200px|thumb|left|Professor's Cube in scrambled state]]\n[[File:Professor's cube solved.jpg|200px|thumb|left|Solved]]\nThe original Professor's Cube design by Udo Krell works by using an expanded 3\u00d73\u00d73 cube as a mantle with the center edge pieces and corners sticking out from the spherical center of identical mechanism to the 3\u00d73\u00d73 cube. All non-central pieces have extensions that fit into slots on the outer pieces of the 3\u00d73\u00d73, which keeps them from falling out of the cube while making a turn. The fixed centers have two sections (one visible, one hidden) which can turn independently. This feature is unique to the original design.<ref name=\"Krell patent\">[http://www.freepatentsonline.com/4600199.html United States Patent 4600199]</ref>\n\nThe Eastsheen version of the puzzle uses a different mechanism. The fixed centers hold the centers next to the central edges in place, which in turn hold the outer edges. The non-central edges hold the corners in place, and the internal sections of the corner pieces do not reach the center of the cube.<ref name=\"Eastsheen patent\">[http://www.freepatentsonline.com/6129356.html United States Patent 6129356]</ref>\n\nThe V-Cube 5 mechanism, designed by Panagiotis Verdes, has elements in common with both. The corners reach to the center of the puzzle (like the original mechanism) and the center pieces hold the central edges in place (like the Eastsheen mechanism). The middle edges and center pieces adjacent to them make up the supporting frame and these have extensions which hold the rest of the pieces together. This allows smooth and fast rotation and creating arguably the fastest and most durable version of the puzzle at that time. Unlike the original 5\u00d75\u00d75 design, the V-Cube 5 mechanism was designed to allow [[speedcubing]].<ref name=\"Verdes patent\">[http://www.freepatentsonline.com/y2007/0057455.html United States Patent 20070057455]</ref> Most current production 5\u00d75\u00d75 speed cubes have mechanisms based on Verdes' patent.\n<gallery>\nFile:Professor's Cube disassembled.jpg|A disassembled Professor's Cube\nFile:V-Cube 5 disassembled.jpg|A disassembled V-Cube 5\nFile:Disassembled Eastsheen 5x5x5.jpg|A disassembled Eastsheen cube\n</gallery>\n\n===Durability===\n[[File:5\u00d75\u00d75 misaligned.jpg|thumb|right|150px|This type of center misalignment occurred during a turn and can only occur with the original design.]]\nThe original Professor's Cube is inherently more delicate than the 3\u00d73\u00d73 Rubik's Cube because of the much greater number of moving parts. Because of the fragile design, the Professor's Cube is not suitable for [[speedcubing]]. Applying excessive force to the cube when twisting it may result in broken pieces.<ref>[http://www.rubiks.com/Shop/Products/Rubiks%205x5%20Cube%20Hex%20Packaging.aspx Rubik's 5\u00d75\u00d75 Cube notice section]</ref>  Both the Eastsheen 5\u00d75\u00d75 and the V-Cube 5 are designed with different mechanisms in an attempt to remedy the fragility of the original design.\n\n==Permutations==\nThere are 98 pieces on the exterior of the cube: 8 corners, 36 edges, and 54 centers (48 movable, 6 fixed).\n\nAny [[permutation]] of the corners is possible, including odd permutations, giving [[factorial|8!]] possible arrangements. Seven of the corners can be independently rotated, and the orientation of the eighth depends on the other seven, giving 3<sup>7</sup> (or 2,187) combinations.\n\nThere are 54 centers. Six of these (the center square of each face) are fixed in position. The rest consist of two sets of 24 centers. Within each set there are four centers of each color. Each set can be arranged in 24! different ways. Assuming that the four centers of each color in each set are indistinguishable, the number of permutations of each set is reduced to 24!/(24<sup>6</sup>) arrangements, all of which are possible. The reducing factor comes about because there are 24 (4!) ways to arrange the four pieces of a given color. This is raised to the sixth power because there are six colors. The total number of permutations of all movable centers is the product of the permutations of the two sets, 24!<sup>2</sup>/(24<sup>12</sup>).\n\nThe 24 outer edges cannot be flipped, since the interior shape of those pieces is asymmetrical. Corresponding outer edges are distinguishable, since the pieces are mirror images of each other. Any permutation of the outer edges is possible, including odd permutations, giving 24! arrangements. The 12 central edges can be flipped. Eleven can be flipped and arranged independently, giving 12!/2 \u00d7 2<sup>11</sup> or 12! \u00d7 2<sup>10</sup> possibilities (an odd permutation of the corners implies an odd permutation of the central edges, and vice versa, thus the division by 2). There are 24! \u00d7 12! \u00d7 2<sup>10</sup> possibilities for the inner and outer edges together.\n\nThis gives a total number of permutations of \n:<math>  \\frac{8! \\times 3^7 \\times 12! \\times 2^{10} \\times 24!^3}{24^{12}} \\approx 2.83 \\times 10^{74}</math>\n\nThe full number is precisely 282 870 942 277 741 856 536 180 333 107 150 328 293 127 731 985 672 134 721 536 000 000 000 000 000 possible permutations<ref name=\"Cubic Circular\">[http://www.jaapsch.net/puzzles/cubic3.htm#p18 Cubic Circular Issues 3 & 4] [[David Singmaster]], 1982</ref> (about 283 duodecillion on the [[names of large numbers|long scale]] or 283 tresvigintillion on the short scale).\n\nSome variations of the Professor's Cube have one of the center pieces marked with a logo, which can be put into four different orientations. This increases the number of permutations by a factor of four to 1.13\u00d710<sup>75</sup>, although any orientation of this piece could be regarded as correct. By comparison, the number of atoms in the [[observable universe]] is estimated at about 10<sup>80</sup>. Other variations increase the difficulty by making the orientation of all center pieces visible. An example of this is shown below.\n\n==Solution==\n[[File:Rubik sz\u00e9tszedve.jpg|thumb|right|150px|An original Professor's Cube with many of the pieces removed, showing the 3\u00d73\u00d73 equivalence of the remaining pieces]]\n[[File:3cubes.jpg|thumb|right|150px|Center is an EastSheen 5\u00d75\u00d75 cube with multicolored stickers, which increase difficulty because the centers need to be in correct places.]]\nPeople able to rapidly solve puzzles like this usually favour the reduction method of grouping similar edge pieces into solid strips, and centers into one-colored blocks.  This allows the cube to be quickly solved with the same methods one would use for a 3\u00d73\u00d73 cube. As illustrated to the right, the fixed centers, middle edges and corners can be treated as equivalent to a 3\u00d73\u00d73 cube. As a result, once reduction is complete the parity errors sometimes seen on the 4\u00d74\u00d74 cannot occur on the 5\u00d75\u00d75, or any cube with an odd number of edges for that matter.\n\nAnother frequently used strategy is to solve the edges of the cube first. The corners can be placed just as they are in any previous order of cube puzzle, and the centers are manipulated with an algorithm similar to the one used in the 4\u00d74\u00d74 cube.\n\nA less frequently used strategy is to solve one side and one rim first, then the 2nd, 3rd and 4th rim, and finally the last side and rim.

It has qualities in common with both the original 3\u00d73\u00d73 Rubik's Cube and the 4\u00d74\u00d74 [[Rubik's Revenge]], and knowing how to solve either can help when working on the 5\u00d75\u00d75 cube.\n\n==History==\n[[File:Rubik's Wahn(5x5x5)origArxon Wiki.jpg|thumb|right|Professor's Cube in original packaging]]\n[[File:V-Cube 5 in Package.jpg|thumb|right|The V-Cube 5 in original packaging]]\nThe 5\u00d75\u00d75 cube was created by Udo Krell in 1981. Out of many designs that were proposed, Udo Krell's design was the first 5\u00d75\u00d75 design that was manufactured and sold. [[Uwe M\u00e8ffert]] manufactured the cube and sold it in [[Hong Kong]] in 1983.\n\n[[Ideal Toy Company|Ideal Toys]] marketed the 5x5x5 cube in [[Germany]] as the \"Rubik's Wahn\" (Wahn meaning delusion or illusion). The 5\u00d75\u00d75 cube got its name when the cube was marketed in [[Japan]] under the name \"Professor's Cube\". M\u00e8ffert reissued the cube under the name \"Professor's Cube\" in the 1990s. <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.speedsolving.com/wiki/index.php/5x5x5_Cube|title=5x5x5 Wiki|last=|first=|date=|website=Speedsolving.com|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\nEarly versions of the 5\u00d75\u00d75 cube sold at [[Barnes & Noble]] were marketed under the name \"Professor's Cube\" but currently, Barnes and Noble sells cubes that are simply called \"5\u00d75.\" Mefferts.com offers a limited edition version of the 5\u00d75\u00d75 cube called the Professor's Cube. This version has colored tiles rather than stickers.<ref>[http://www.mefferts.com/products/details.php?lang=en&category=13&id=238 Meffert's Professor's Cube]</ref> Verdes Innovations sells a version called the V-Cube 5.<ref>[http://www.v-cubes.com/prod_info/v-cube5.php Verdes' Innovations V-Cube 5 page] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100327224620/http://www.v-cubes.com/prod_info/v-cube5.php |date=2010-03-27 }}</ref>\n\n==Workings==\n[[File:Professors cube.jpg|200px|thumb|left|Professor's Cube in scrambled state]]\n[[File:Professor's cube solved.jpg|200px|thumb|left|Solved]]\nThe original Professor's Cube design by Udo Krell works by using an expanded 3\u00d73\u00d73 cube as a mantle with the center edge pieces and corners sticking out from the spherical center of identical mechanism to the 3\u00d73\u00d73 cube. All non-central pieces have extensions that fit into slots on the outer pieces of the 3\u00d73\u00d73, which keeps them from falling out of the cube while making a turn. The fixed centers have two sections (one visible, one hidden) which can turn independently. This feature is unique to the original design.<ref name=\"Krell patent\">[http://www.freepatentsonline.com/4600199.html United States Patent 4600199]</ref>\n\nThe Eastsheen version of the puzzle uses a different mechanism. The fixed centers hold the centers next to the central edges in place, which in turn hold the outer edges. The non-central edges hold the corners in place, and the internal sections of the corner pieces do not reach the center of the cube.<ref name=\"Eastsheen patent\">[http://www.freepatentsonline.com/6129356.html United States Patent 6129356]</ref>\n\nThe V-Cube 5 mechanism, designed by Panagiotis Verdes, has elements in common with both. The corners reach to the center of the puzzle (like the original mechanism) and the center pieces hold the central edges in place (like the Eastsheen mechanism). The middle edges and center pieces adjacent to them make up the supporting frame and these have extensions which hold the rest of the pieces together. This allows smooth and fast rotation and creating arguably the fastest and most durable version of the puzzle at that time. Unlike the original 5\u00d75\u00d75 design, the V-Cube 5 mechanism was designed to allow [[speedcubing]].<ref name=\"Verdes patent\">[http://www.freepatentsonline.com/y2007/0057455.html United States Patent 20070057455]</ref> Most current production 5\u00d75\u00d75 speed cubes have mechanisms based on Verdes' patent.\n<gallery>\nFile:Professor's Cube disassembled.jpg|A disassembled Professor's Cube\nFile:V-Cube 5 disassembled.jpg|A disassembled V-Cube 5\nFile:Disassembled Eastsheen 5x5x5.jpg|A disassembled Eastsheen cube\n</gallery>\n\n===Durability===\n[[File:5\u00d75\u00d75 misaligned.jpg|thumb|right|150px|An original cube with a misaligned center.

O'Shee aligned himself with the leadership of [[John Redmond]].<ref name=\"maume\"/>\n\nDillon decided to intervene and set about splitting the ILLA in 1905, forming a new \"original\" ILLA group, strictly subservient to the Party, under the loyal \"Redmonite\" O'Shee.

Attempts at a reunion were thwarted by O'Shee's insistence that Sheehan must step down. In the long run the Party's intervention weakened Sheehan's renamed LLA group,<ref name=\"maume\"/> and the labour movement in general.\n\n== Multiple career ==\nO'Shee found it difficult initially to combine his responsibilities as a solicitor with those of his political career, and was in fact reprimanded by Redmond in 1903 for his failing to attend parliament regularly. This was alleviated when his brother became a solicitor, joined his practise and took over much of O'Shee's workload.  This enabled him to extend his practise across Kilkenny, Waterford and Tipperary synergising it with supporting negotiations in land purchase. His legal knowledge also proved valuable in his parliamentary work on social legislation.<ref name=\"maume\"/>\n\nHe was one of the few members of the IPP who took a singular course in many matters. In 1913 he supported a [[Women's suffrage in the United Kingdom|woman's suffrage bill]], despite instructions to vote against it (which Redmond did). At the outbreak of the [[World War I|Great War]] he actively recruited in support of [[Ireland in World War I|Ireland's involvement in the war]], but after the [[Easter Rising|1916 Rising]] he urged that a more nationalistic approach be taken. At the outset of the [[Irish Convention]] he joined [[Arthur Alfred Lynch|Arthur Lynch]] and four other MPs in signing a declaration that no [[Partition of Ireland|partition based settlement]] would be acceptable. He regarded the idea of separation as absurd because Ireland was dependent on the British market.<ref name=\"maume\"/>\n\n== After years ==\nHis tenacity saw him take his stand in the [[1918 Irish general election]], where he was defeated by [[Sinn F\u00e9in]]'s [[Cathal Brugha]] in the new [[West Waterford (UK Parliament constituency)|West Waterford]] constituency.\n\nOn 1 June 1921 O'Shee married Anne Mary (Nancy), daughter of Thomas B. Naughton, farmer of [[Mullinahone]], Co. Tipperary. They had two sons and four daughters.\n\nJames John O'Shee continued to practise law in Clonmel until he retired in 1935.

His first Cabinet post under [[Henry Campbell-Bannerman]] was as [[President of the Board of Education]], after which he served as [[First Lord of the Admiralty]]. His most important roles were as [[Home Secretary]] and [[Chancellor of the Exchequer]] during the premiership of [[H. H. Asquith]]. He was studious and meticulous, noted for his attention to detail, but also for being bureaucratic and partisan.<ref>{{harvp|McKenna|1948}}</ref>{{page needed|date=September 2019}}<ref>{{harvp|Jenkins|1998|pp=158\u2013206}}</ref>\n\n==Background and education==\nBorn in [[Kensington]], London,<ref name=odnbMcKenna /> McKenna was the son of William Columban McKenna and his wife Emma, daughter of Charles Hanby.<ref name=odnbMcKenna/> [[Joseph Neale McKenna|Sir Joseph Neale McKenna]] was his uncle.

McKenna was a Liberal Imperialist. After the [[1900 United Kingdom general election|Khaki Election of 1900]], he favoured the return to government of former Liberal Prime Minister [[Archibald Primrose, 5th Earl of Rosebery|Lord Rosebery]], although this did not happen.<ref>on 17 November 1900, in conversation with Wemyss Reid, in McKinstry, L. (2005) \"Rosebery\", 425.</ref>\n\nIn December 1905 McKenna was appointed, in preference to [[Winston Churchill]], as [[Financial Secretary to the Treasury]]. He then served in the Liberal Cabinets of Campbell-Bannerman and Asquith as [[President of the Board of Education]], [[List of the First Lords of the Admiralty|First Lord of the Admiralty]] (1908\u201311), and [[Home Secretary]].\n\nHe was considered methodical and efficient, but his opponents thought him priggish, prissy and lacking in charisma. McKenna's estimates were submitted to unprecedented scrutiny by the 'economists' [[David Lloyd George|Lloyd George]] and Churchill. McKenna submitted large naval estimates in December 1906 for the years 1909-10 of \u00a336 m. This was the Dreadnought building programme inspired by naval reformer [[John Fisher, 1st Baron Fisher|Admiral Fisher]].\n[[File:McKenna R Vanity Fair 1906-10-31.jpg|thumb|left|150px|Reginald McKenna by [[Leslie Ward]] ([[Vanity Fair caricatures]]) entitled \"In the winning crew\"]]\nIn 1907 [[James Bryce, 1st Viscount Bryce|James Bryce]] was appointed Ambassador to the US, [[Augustine Birrell]] replaced him as [[Chief Secretary for Ireland]], and McKenna succeeded Birrell as President of the Board of Education.

Do You Like McKenna&#039;s Navy Cut? (22914896191).jpg|thumb|Electors! Do You Like McKenna's Navy Cut?]]\nAt the Admiralty McKenna started the [[Labour Exchanges Act 1909|Labour Exchange Bill]] from May 1909, a policy later associated with Churchill, in an effort to relieve unemployment. He was increasingly attacked in speeches outside Parliament. The number of Dreadnoughts to be built was increased from six to eight ships; four initially and four later. Lloyd George and Churchill had attacked McKenna's position in a plan to persuade the Liberal left of the need for defence cuts. Nonetheless McKenna was on the Cabinet finance committee that discussed Lloyd George's budget proposal of 7 March 1910, and on 12 April refused to contemplate the chancellor's proposed defence cuts.<ref>{{harvp|David|1977|pp=75\u201377}}</ref>\n\nHe held his seat in the General Elections of 1910, and kept his post at the Admiralty in Asquith's government.{{sfnp|Owen|2014|p=127}} McKenna had attended the Sub-Committee of the [[Committee of Imperial Defence]] (CID) on 17 December 1908 and 23 March 1909, during which periods he had fully comprehended the gravity of the naval threat.{{sfnp|Owen|2014|p=127}} He also attended the famous meeting on 23 August 1911, chaired by the Prime Minister, at which [[Henry Hughes Wilson, 1st Baronet|Brigadier-General Wilson]], over naval opposition, persuaded ministers to deploy an expeditionary force to France in the event of war.{{sfnp|Owen|2014|p=98}} Asquith dismissed the Royal Navy's war plans as \"wholly impracticable\".{{sfnp|Owen|2014|p=121}}\n\nMcKenna had little support in Cabinet, and Asquith, [[Richard Haldane, 1st Viscount Haldane|Richard Haldane]], and Churchill wanted the latter to replace him at the Admiralty. Fortunately war was averted despite the [[Agadir Crisis]].{{sfnp|Owen|2014|pp=115, 121}} On 16 November McKenna accepted the Home Office, swapping jobs with Churchill.{{sfnp|Owen|2014|p=121}}\n\nIn total McKenna had 'laid the keels' of 18 new battleships that contributed mightily to the Jutland fleet. McKenna commenced the Dreadnought Arms Race: the fundamental strategic basis was for a vast fleet, large enough to intimidate Germany to decline to fight. But in the event Britain's advantage was ephemeral and fleeting.{{sfnp|Jenkins|1998|pp=151\u2013158}}\n\n=== Peacetime Home Secretary ===\nMcKenna accepted his move to the Home Office in October 1911 partly because he had recovered from an appendicitis operation. He was one of numerous Cabinet appointments at the time which, according to historian [[Duncan Tanner]], \"pushed the (Liberal) party still further to the left\".<ref>{{cite book|last=Tanner|first=Duncan|authorlink=Duncan Tanner|title=Political Change and the Labour Party 1900-1918|edition=First paperback|year=2002|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge|isbn=0521530539|page=60|chapter=Ideas and politics, 1906-1914}}</ref> McKenna and [[Charles Hobhouse]] were responsible for the Welsh Church Disestablishment Bill finally drafted on 20 February 1912. The ''[[ODNB]]'' calls him a wise and judicious Home Secretary. He was stolidly opposed by the Conservative [[F E Smith, 1st Earl of Birkenhead|F.E.Smith]].\n\nAnother piece of legislation ensued in the Coal Mines Bill regulating pay and conditions. McKenna enthusiastically supported the minimum wage bill in principle, but partly to prevent 'civil war' in the coalfields.<ref>{{harvp|David|1977|p=113}}</ref> With Asquith's approval McKenna left a Cabinet meeting, at which he was on the majority side, to attend on the King, having left behind an \"admirable memo.\"<ref>{{harvp|David|1977|p=116}}</ref>\n\nThroughout the summer of 1912 he opposed the escalation of the naval race, occasioned by Churchill's plan to build a new Mediterranean fleet.<ref>{{harvp|David|1977|p=117}}</ref>\n\nHe opposed a Temperance Bill. He also made a radical proposal to let prisoners out on short licence, which he sponsored to deal with militant suffragists, a bill unanimously approved by cabinet. On 13 March 1913 he voted against compulsory military training.<ref>{{harvp|David|1977|pp=133\u2013134}}</ref>\n\nAt a \"council of war\" with Lloyd George on 13 June, McKenna was left in no doubt that Asquith had refused the chancellor's resignation over the [[Marconi scandal]]. McKenna himself was categorical as to their innocence of the share dealings. This advice may have saved the Welsh Wizard's career. He made it clear that the Government could not secure any contracts for favours whether from Marconi or Lord Cowdray.\n\nWith Irish parentage in his own family, McKenna was happy to support the half-cash, half-stock scheme on 16 July for the Irish Purchase Act introduced by Augustine Birrell, as the prospect for Irish Home Rule drew ever nearer. Dublin was in turmoil, to McKenna and others on the Left ([[Walter Runciman, 1st Viscount Runciman of Doxford|Walter Runciman]], Charles Hobhouse, and [[John Burns]]) it was as much [[Edward Carson]]'s fault as [[James Larkin]]'s.\n\nMcKenna blamed Churchill for stirring up the [[Alfred Harmsworth, 1st Viscount Northcliffe|Northcliffe]] press against the cabinet's plans to boost the army's budget by \u00a3800,000 and a proposed increase of \u00a36 million in the Royal Navy's bi-annual estimate.<ref>{{harvp|David|1977|pp=152\u2013153}}</ref> In the new year McKenna was one of Lloyd George's group to analyse Churchill's plans for Dreadnought construction; they insisted that expenditure must be reduced to that of 1912\u201313.\n\nIn late January 1914 his friends Charles Hobhouse and [[Sir John Simon]] agreed to lobby the Chancellor. The following day at the Treasury their \"entire sitting was taken up\" by the group's tirade against Churchill's management of the Admiralty. They retired the next morning to Smith Square to discuss the Home Rule crisis in Ireland; a dissolution \"would be a complete practical triumph for the Tory Party\", wrote Hobhouse; their group was expanded to include Beauchamp and Runciman.<ref>{{harvp|David|1977|pp=159\u2013160}}</ref> On 29 January the group sent a petition to Asquith protesting against the Naval Estimates, now assumed to total \u00a352.5 million.\n\nMcKenna had been receiving messages of grave concern from Irish leader [[John Redmond]]. On 17 July, before the weekend, McKenna proposed an Amending Bill to the Government of Ireland Bill to allow any Ulster county to opt out of Home Rule.\n\n=== Wartime Home Secretary ===\nThe problems of Ireland paled into insignificance in early August. Broadly-speaking McKenna, an Asquithian, supported the pledge to go to war to defend Belgium's neutrality, but he did not want to send the [[British Expeditionary Force (First World War)|British Expeditionary Force]] (BEF). [[Charles Masterman]], Runciman and McKenna all wanted to stall the Kaiser for invaluable time.<ref>''Cabinet Discussions'', 1 Aug 1914</ref><ref>{{harvp|Owen|2014|p=205}}</ref> Most of the cabinet opposed armed intervention in France, almost up until the declaration of war.<ref>{{harvp|David|1977|pp=179\u2013181}}</ref>\n\nThe Home Secretary remained in charge of State Security: more than 6,000 espionage cases were investigated, none of which produced any traitors. The '[[German Plot (Ireland)|German Plot]]' in Ireland had sparked fears that Britain was infiltrated by a network of spies. In response cable telegraphs were laid from Dartmouth to Brest in Brittany to guarantee Allied communications links. On 20 October a warrant went out for the arrest of 23,000 Germanic aliens, and food supplies to Belgium were cut lest they fell into German hands. McKenna refused to allow the publication of the sinking of [[HMS Audacious (1912)|HMS ''Audacious'']]; in the event it was 'leaked' to [[The Evening News (London newspaper)|''The Evening News'']] anyway. And on 30 October the Cabinet announced a general policy of censorship.<ref>{{harvp|David|1977|p=204}}</ref> In the ''Wilhelmina'' case he again referred to the legal situation, seeking a solution in international law.\n\nMcKenna disliked the autocratic and dismissive [[Herbert Kitchener, 1st Earl Kitchener|Lord Kitchener]], appointed [[Secretary of State for War]] at the start of the war. Immediately on his appointment their relations soured: the policy of voluntary recruitment continued as the Army needed one million men, until the Adjutant-General complained there were too many new recruits. On 5 March 1915 McKenna reported that the [[Ritz Carlton Hotel]], New York was being used as a spy network to inform on British intelligence; the government, determined to prevent the USA entering the war on Germany's side, informed Washington.<ref>{{harvp|David|1977|p=226}}</ref> McKenna supported Asquith and gradually fell out with Lloyd George.\n\nInternal wrangling in Cabinet conversations reached fever pitch: [[Edwin Montagu]], a cousin of [[Herbert Samuel]] and ally of Lloyd George suggested that Asquith was jealous of Sir [[Edward Grey, 1st Viscount Grey of Fallodon|Edward Grey]]'s prowess in the Foreign Office. When in April 1915 the Home Secretary banned Montagu from his home for six months, the scene was set for a final split in the party. McKenna was a Teetotaller, something he had impressed upon the King was necessary for good government. His Majesty \"took the pledge\" for the duration of the war, an example which Lord Chancellor Haldane felt he had to follow for the remainder of his time in office. McKenna's asceticism won few new friends, so that when the end came for his career it was both dramatic and complete.<ref>{{harvp|David|1977|pp=238\u2013239}}</ref>\n\n=== Asquith's Liberal Chancellor ===\nIn May 1915 Asquith formed a coalition government. McKenna, a reluctant coalitionist,<ref>{{harvp|Jenkins|1998|p=197}}</ref> became [[Chancellor of the Exchequer]]. In the meantime, McKenna oversaw the issue of the Second [[War bond|War Loan]] in June 1915, at an interest rate of 4.5%, although his first budget was actually on 21 September 1915 was a serious attempt to deal with an impending debt crisis. Revenues were rising, but not by enough to cover the \u00a31.6 billion government expenditure. McKenna increased income tax rates and introduced a 50% excess profit tax, and increases in indirect taxation of goods such as tea, coffee, and tobacco.<ref name=\"Jenkinsp199\">{{harvp|Jenkins|1998|p=199}}</ref> Post Office charge increases could not be included in the Budget (as they would have endangered its status as a money bill), and were instead introduced in a Post Office and Telegraph Bill.<ref name = \"Jenkinsp199\"/>\n\n=== McKenna duties ===\n{{anchor|McKenna Duties}}\nIn September 1915 he introduced a 33{{1/3}}% levy on luxury imports in order to fund the war effort. The McKenna duties applied to cinematographic film; clocks and watches; motorcars and motorcycles; and musical instruments.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Varian|first=Brian D.|title=The growth of manufacturing protection in 1920s Britain|journal=Scottish Journal of Political Economy|language=en|volume=0|doi=10.1111/sjpe.12223|issn=1467-9485|year=2019}}</ref> The duties were revoked by [[Ramsay MacDonald]]'s short-lived Labour government in 1924, only to be reimposed in 1925.\n\n=== Fiscal relations and Lloyd George ===\nThe April 1916 budget saw further large rises in income and excess profit taxes, at a time when prices of basic food commodities were rising. Sales taxes were extended to rail tickets, mineral water, cider and perry, and entertainments. The government pledged that if they issued War Loan at the even higher interest (as they did with the 5% issue of 1917), holders of the 4.5% bonds might also convert to the new rate. His predecessor [[David Lloyd George]] criticised McKenna in his memoirs for increasing the interest rate from 3.5% on the 1914 War Loan at a time when investors had few alternatives and might even have had their capital \"conscripted\" by the government.  Not only did the change ultimately increase the nation's interest payments by \u00a3100 million/year but it meant rates were higher throughout the economy during the [[Economic history of the United Kingdom#Postwar stagnation|post-war depression]].<ref>{{cite book | first=David | last=Lloyd George | title=War Memoirs Volume I | year=1938 | publisher=Odhams Press | location=London | url=https://archive.org/details/warmemoirsvolume035284mbp | pages=73\u20134}}</ref> Compared with France, the British government relied more on short-term financing in the form of treasury bills and exchequer bonds during World War I; Treasury bills provided the bulk of British government funds in 1916.<ref name=Horn82>{{harvp|Horn|2002|loc=[https://books.google.com/books?id=H1l8CHbZG74C&lpg=PA82 p.&nbsp;82]}}</ref> McKenna fell out with [[Walter Cunliffe, 1st Baron Cunliffe|Lord Cunliffe]], [[Governor of the Bank of England]].  Furthermore, he tried to sequestrate the assets of the US Prudential Assurance Company to pay for American war ''materiel'' purchases.\n\nAn opponent of Lloyd George,<ref>{{cite book|last=Douglas|first=Roy|title=Liberals: A History of the Liberal and Liberal Democratic Parties|year=2005|publisher=Hambledon Continuum|isbn=1852853530|page=197|chapter=Politics in Chaos}}</ref> McKenna was critical of the Prime Minister's political approach, telling Conservative politician [[Arthur Balfour]] that \"you disagree with us, but you can understand our principles. Lloyd George doesn't understand them and we can't make him\".<ref>{{cite book|last=Sykes|first=Alan|title=The Rise and Fall of British Liberalism: 1776-1988|year=2014|publisher=Routledge|isbn=0582060575|chapter=Welfare, Finance and Freedom|page=156}}</ref> But unlike McKenna, Lloyd George had no problem with relations with Cunliffe.\n\nMcKenna nevertheless saw the state as having an important role in society, a sentiment that he shared with Asquith.  As noted by his biographer and nephew, [[Stephen McKenna (novelist)|Stephen McKenna]],\n\n<blockquote>Without trying to define the whole duty of Liberal man, Asquith and McKenna were at one in seeing that if certain services were not undertaken by the state, they would not be undertaken at all. Old age pensions were a case in point. They had not been dangled as an electioneering bait; Asquith made no appeal to sentiment or emotion when the Cabinet committee of investigation was set up, but from their first days together at the Treasury he and McKenna had agreed that, if the money could be found, this was a matter on which a beginning must be made forthwith.<ref>{{cite book|last=McKenna|first=Stephen|authorlink=Stephen McKenna (novelist)|title=Reginald McKenna, 1863-1943: A Memoir|year=1948|publisher=Eyre & Spottiswoode|location = London|page=46}}</ref></blockquote>\n\n=== Conscription ===\nThe issue of enforced service in the armed forces was controversial in Britain. The Conservatives were almost entirely in favour, but the Liberals were split, with Asquithians largely opposed on libertarian grounds, whilst Lloyd George united with the Tories in what he declared to be a vital national interest. Sir John Simon, Liberal Home Secretary and an ally of McKenna, resigned over the conscription of bachelors in January 1916.  As Chancellor of Exchequer McKenna objected to the conscription of married men in May 1916 on purely economic grounds, arguing that it would 'deplete' Britain's war industries.  McKenna knew that for Asquith to remain in office he had to move towards conscription, whether he liked it or not; if he did not, the Tories would topple the government.<ref>{{harvp|Jenkins|1998|pp=102\u2013103}}</ref>\n\nAt a decisive meeting on 4 December 1916 McKenna tried to persuade Asquith to sack Lloyd George to save the government. McKenna retired into opposition upon the fall of Asquith at the end of 1916.\n\n===Chairman of the Midland Bank===\nHe lost his seat in the [[1918 United Kingdom general election|1918 general election]] and became a non-executive member of the board of the [[Midland Bank]] at the invitation of the Chairman, Liberal MP [[Sir Edward Holden, 1st Baronet|Sir Edward Holden]]. Before Holden died in 1919, McKenna had sat in his office everyday to observe the activities of a chairman.  An elaborate coda was drafted to allow the bank's directors to determine whether he should resign his Pontypool seat where he was presently the Liberal candidate (his previous seat of North Monmouthshire had disappeared in boundary changes). But the situation did not arise as he was not elected in [[1922 United Kingdom general election|1922]]. The new [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Prime Minister]] [[Bonar Law]] hoped to persuade him to come out of retirement and serve once again at the Exchequer in a Conservative Cabinet, but he refused, and remained in private life.<ref name=\"harvp|Jenkins|1998|pp=203\u2013204\">{{harvp|Jenkins|1998|pp=203\u2013204}}</ref> His refusal was partly because he wanted to promote an alliance between Bonar Law and Asquith, who was still official leader of the Liberal Party.<ref>{{harvp|Jenkins|1964|p=495}}</ref> The following year Bonar Law's successor Stanley Baldwin repeated the request and McKenna was more agreeable, but again declined.<ref name=\"harvp|Jenkins|1998|pp=203\u2013204\"/>\n\nMcKenna used his status as chairman of one of the big five British banks to argue that [[monetary policy]] could be used to achieve domestic macroeconomic objectives.  At the Chamberlain-Bradbury committee he questioned whether a return to the [[gold standard]] was desirable. [[John Maynard Keynes]] was the only other witness to do so, although others proposed a delayed return.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://robertskidelsky.com/1998/02/15/the-first-100-years-a-policy-that-crippled-the-gold-standard-debate/|title=The First 100 Years: A policy that crippled: The Gold Standard debate|last=Skidelsky|first=Robert|authorlink = Robert Skidelsky|date=15 February 1998|work=robertskidelsky.com|accessdate=30 September 2019}}</ref>\n\n=== A return to Government? ===\nAccording to Lord Birkenhead Lloyd George's Liberals were of poor intellect, with no great leaders to take the government onwards. McKenna was certainly a technocrat but did not want to be Prime Minister, yet he might conceivably have been offered the post. In reality, the Conservatives wanted one of their own. However he wished to enter Parliament in July 1923 as MP for the [[City of London (UK Parliament constituency)|City of London]] and neither of the incumbent MPs would agree to vacate in order to make room. As a result, McKenna declined as he had no wish to vacate the bank. McKenna continued to write economic reports for Whitehall and Westminster, but by August 1923 his political career had come to an end. The lasting impression was one of the pin-striped merchant banker, a model of precision, but not a clubbable leader of men; his absence from London society and [[Brooks's]] seemed to imply retirement.<ref>{{harvp|Jenkins|1998|pp=205\u2013206}}</ref> However, his financial reputation was such as to prompt [[Stanley Baldwin]] to demand his return to government in the 1930s. As late as 1939 it was proposed that he should be brought back to replace [[National Liberal Party (UK, 1931)|Liberal National]] Chancellor Sir John Simon. McKenna was the last of the Asquithians to die, in 1943.<ref>{{harvp|Jenkins|1998|p=389}}</ref>\n\n==Family==\nMcKenna was married in 1908 to Pamela Jekyll (who died November 1943), younger daughter of Sir Herbert Jekyll (brother of landscape gardener [[Gertrude Jekyll]]) and his wife [[Agnes Jekyll|Dame Agnes Jekyll]], n\u00e9e Graham.<ref name=odnbMcKenna/> They had two sons \u2013 Michael (died 1931) and David, who married Lady Cecilia Elizabeth Keppel (12 April 1910 \u2013 16 June 2003), a daughter of [[Walter Keppel, 9th Earl of Albemarle]] in 1934. McKenna was a talented financier, and a champion bridge player in his free time. In royal company at Balmoral McKenna played golf.<ref>Haig, ''Diaries'', p.285-6</ref>{{Incomplete short citation|date=September 2019}}\n\nReginald McKenna died in London on 6 September 1943, and was buried at [[St Andrew's Church, Mells|St Andrew's Church]] in [[Mells, Somerset|Mells]], Somerset. His wife died two months later, and is buried beside him. McKenna was a regular client of [[Sir Edwin Lutyens]] who designed the Midland Bank headquarters in [[Poultry, London]], and several branches. Pamela McKenna was a high society hostess whose dinner parties charmed Asquith at their Lutyens-built townhouse in [[Smith Square]].

His first Cabinet post under [[Henry Campbell-Bannerman]] was as [[President of the Board of Education]], after which he served as [[First Lord of the Admiralty]]. His most important roles were as [[Home Secretary]] and [[Chancellor of the Exchequer]] during the premiership of [[H. H. Asquith]]. He was studious and meticulous, noted for his attention to detail, but also for being bureaucratic and partisan.<ref>{{harvp|McKenna|1948}}</ref>{{page needed|date=September 2019}}<ref>{{harvp|Jenkins|1998|pp=158\u2013206}}</ref>\n\n==Background and education==\nBorn in [[Kensington]], London,<ref name=odnbMcKenna /> McKenna was the son of William Columban McKenna and his wife Emma, daughter of Charles Hanby.<ref name=odnbMcKenna/> [[Joseph Neale McKenna|Sir Joseph Neale McKenna]] was his uncle. McKenna was educated at [[King's College School]] and at [[Trinity Hall, Cambridge]].<ref>{{acad|id=MKN882R|name=McKenna, Reginald}}</ref> At Cambridge he was a notable rower. In 1886, he was a member of the [[Trinity Hall Boat Club]] [[eight (rowing)|eight]] that won the [[Grand Challenge Cup]] at [[Henley Royal Regatta]].<ref>[http://www.ebooksread.com/authors-eng/r-c-rudolf-chambers-lehmann/the-complete-oarsman-hci/page-26-the-complete-oarsman-hci.shtml R C Lehmann \"The Complete Oarsman'']</ref> He rowed [[bow (rowing)|bow]] in the winning [[Cambridge University Boat Club|Cambridge]] boat in the [[The Boat Race 1887|1887 Boat Race]]. Also in 1887 he was a member of the Trinity Hall [[coxless four]] that won the [[Stewards' Challenge Cup]] at Henley.\n\n==Political career==\n[[File:Reginald_McKenna.jpg|thumb|left|Reginald McKenna c1895]] \nMcKenna was elected at the [[1895 United Kingdom general election|1895 general election]] as [[Member of Parliament]] (MP) for [[North Monmouthshire (UK Parliament constituency)|North Monmouthshire]]. McKenna was a Liberal Imperialist. After the [[1900 United Kingdom general election|Khaki Election of 1900]], he favoured the return to government of former Liberal Prime Minister [[Archibald Primrose, 5th Earl of Rosebery|Lord Rosebery]], although this did not happen.<ref>on 17 November 1900, in conversation with Wemyss Reid, in McKinstry, L. (2005) \"Rosebery\", 425.</ref>\n\nIn December 1905 McKenna was appointed, in preference to [[Winston Churchill]], as [[Financial Secretary to the Treasury]]. He then served in the Liberal Cabinets of Campbell-Bannerman and Asquith as [[President of the Board of Education]], [[List of the First Lords of the Admiralty|First Lord of the Admiralty]] (1908\u201311), and [[Home Secretary]].\n\nHe was considered methodical and efficient, but his opponents thought him priggish, prissy and lacking in charisma. McKenna's estimates were submitted to unprecedented scrutiny by the 'economists' [[David Lloyd George|Lloyd George]] and Churchill. McKenna submitted large naval estimates in December 1906 for the years 1909-10 of \u00a336 m. This was the Dreadnought building programme inspired by naval reformer [[John Fisher, 1st Baron Fisher|Admiral Fisher]].\n[[File:McKenna R Vanity Fair 1906-10-31.jpg|thumb|left|150px|Reginald McKenna by [[Leslie Ward]] ([[Vanity Fair caricatures]]) entitled \"In the winning crew\"]]\nIn 1907 [[James Bryce, 1st Viscount Bryce|James Bryce]] was appointed Ambassador to the US, [[Augustine Birrell]] replaced him as [[Chief Secretary for Ireland]], and McKenna succeeded Birrell as President of the Board of Education.

Do You Like McKenna&#039;s Navy Cut? (22914896191).jpg|thumb|Electors! Do You Like McKenna's Navy Cut?]]\nAt the Admiralty McKenna started the [[Labour Exchanges Act 1909|Labour Exchange Bill]] from May 1909, a policy later associated with Churchill, in an effort to relieve unemployment. He was increasingly attacked in speeches outside Parliament. The number of Dreadnoughts to be built was increased from six to eight ships; four initially and four later. Lloyd George and Churchill had attacked McKenna's position in a plan to persuade the Liberal left of the need for defence cuts. Nonetheless McKenna was on the Cabinet finance committee that discussed Lloyd George's budget proposal of 7 March 1910, and on 12 April refused to contemplate the chancellor's proposed defence cuts.<ref>{{harvp|David|1977|pp=75\u201377}}</ref>\n\nHe held his seat in the General Elections of 1910, and kept his post at the Admiralty in Asquith's government.{{sfnp|Owen|2014|p=127}} McKenna had attended the Sub-Committee of the [[Committee of Imperial Defence]] (CID) on 17 December 1908 and 23 March 1909, during which periods he had fully comprehended the gravity of the naval threat.{{sfnp|Owen|2014|p=127}} He also attended the famous meeting on 23 August 1911, chaired by the Prime Minister, at which [[Henry Hughes Wilson, 1st Baronet|Brigadier-General Wilson]], over naval opposition, persuaded ministers to deploy an expeditionary force to France in the event of war.{{sfnp|Owen|2014|p=98}} Asquith dismissed the Royal Navy's war plans as \"wholly impracticable\".{{sfnp|Owen|2014|p=121}}\n\nMcKenna had little support in Cabinet, and Asquith, [[Richard Haldane, 1st Viscount Haldane|Richard Haldane]], and Churchill wanted the latter to replace him at the Admiralty. Fortunately war was averted despite the [[Agadir Crisis]].{{sfnp|Owen|2014|pp=115, 121}} On 16 November McKenna accepted the Home Office, swapping jobs with Churchill.{{sfnp|Owen|2014|p=121}}\n\nIn total McKenna had 'laid the keels' of 18 new battleships that contributed mightily to the Jutland fleet. McKenna commenced the Dreadnought Arms Race: the fundamental strategic basis was for a vast fleet, large enough to intimidate Germany to decline to fight. But in the event Britain's advantage was ephemeral and fleeting.{{sfnp|Jenkins|1998|pp=151\u2013158}}\n\n=== Peacetime Home Secretary ===\nMcKenna accepted his move to the Home Office in October 1911 partly because he had recovered from an appendicitis operation. He was one of numerous Cabinet appointments at the time which, according to historian [[Duncan Tanner]], \"pushed the (Liberal) party still further to the left\".<ref>{{cite book|last=Tanner|first=Duncan|authorlink=Duncan Tanner|title=Political Change and the Labour Party 1900-1918|edition=First paperback|year=2002|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge|isbn=0521530539|page=60|chapter=Ideas and politics, 1906-1914}}</ref> McKenna and [[Charles Hobhouse]] were responsible for the Welsh Church Disestablishment Bill finally drafted on 20 February 1912. The ''[[ODNB]]'' calls him a wise and judicious Home Secretary. He was stolidly opposed by the Conservative [[F E Smith, 1st Earl of Birkenhead|F.E.Smith]].\n\nAnother piece of legislation ensued in the Coal Mines Bill regulating pay and conditions. McKenna enthusiastically supported the minimum wage bill in principle, but partly to prevent 'civil war' in the coalfields.<ref>{{harvp|David|1977|p=113}}</ref> With Asquith's approval McKenna left a Cabinet meeting, at which he was on the majority side, to attend on the King, having left behind an \"admirable memo.\"<ref>{{harvp|David|1977|p=116}}</ref>\n\nThroughout the summer of 1912 he opposed the escalation of the naval race, occasioned by Churchill's plan to build a new Mediterranean fleet.<ref>{{harvp|David|1977|p=117}}</ref>\n\nHe opposed a Temperance Bill. He also made a radical proposal to let prisoners out on short licence, which he sponsored to deal with militant suffragists, a bill unanimously approved by cabinet. On 13 March 1913 he voted against compulsory military training.<ref>{{harvp|David|1977|pp=133\u2013134}}</ref>\n\nAt a \"council of war\" with Lloyd George on 13 June, McKenna was left in no doubt that Asquith had refused the chancellor's resignation over the [[Marconi scandal]]. McKenna himself was categorical as to their innocence of the share dealings. This advice may have saved the Welsh Wizard's career. He made it clear that the Government could not secure any contracts for favours whether from Marconi or Lord Cowdray.\n\nWith Irish parentage in his own family, McKenna was happy to support the half-cash, half-stock scheme on 16 July for the Irish Purchase Act introduced by Augustine Birrell, as the prospect for Irish Home Rule drew ever nearer. Dublin was in turmoil, to McKenna and others on the Left ([[Walter Runciman, 1st Viscount Runciman of Doxford|Walter Runciman]], Charles Hobhouse, and [[John Burns]]) it was as much [[Edward Carson]]'s fault as [[James Larkin]]'s.\n\nMcKenna blamed Churchill for stirring up the [[Alfred Harmsworth, 1st Viscount Northcliffe|Northcliffe]] press against the cabinet's plans to boost the army's budget by \u00a3800,000 and a proposed increase of \u00a36 million in the Royal Navy's bi-annual estimate.<ref>{{harvp|David|1977|pp=152\u2013153}}</ref> In the new year McKenna was one of Lloyd George's group to analyse Churchill's plans for Dreadnought construction; they insisted that expenditure must be reduced to that of 1912-13.\n\nIn late January 1914 his friends Charles Hobhouse and [[Sir John Simon]] agreed to lobby the Chancellor. The following day at the Treasury their \"entire sitting was taken up\" by the group's tirade against Churchill's management of the Admiralty. They retired the next morning to Smith Square to discuss the Home Rule crisis in Ireland; a dissolution \"would be a complete practical triumph for the Tory Party\", wrote Hobhouse; their group was expanded to include Beauchamp and Runciman.<ref>{{harvp|David|1977|pp=159\u2013160}}</ref> On 29 January the group sent a petition to Asquith protesting against the Naval Estimates, now assumed to total \u00a352.5 millions.\n\nMcKenna had been receiving messages of grave concern from Irish leader [[John Redmond]]. On 17 July, before the weekend, McKenna proposed an Amending Bill to the Government of Ireland Bill to allow any Ulster county to opt out of Home Rule.\n\n=== Wartime Home Secretary ===\nThe problems of Ireland paled into insignificance in early August. Broadly-speaking McKenna, an Asquithian, supported the pledge to go to war to defend Belgium's neutrality, but he did not want to send the [[British Expeditionary Force (First World War)|British Expeditionary Force]] (BEF). [[Charles Masterman]], Runciman and McKenna all wanted to stall the Kaiser for invaluable time.<ref>''Cabinet Discussions'', 1 Aug 1914</ref><ref>{{harvp|Owen|2014|p=205}}</ref> Most of the cabinet opposed armed intervention in France, almost up until the declaration of war.<ref>{{harvp|David|1977|pp=179\u2013181}}</ref>\n\nThe Home Secretary remained in charge of State Security: more than 6,000 espionage cases were investigated, none of which produced any traitors. The '[[German Plot (Ireland)|German Plot]]' in Ireland had sparked fears that Britain was infiltrated by a network of spies. In response cable telegraphs were laid from Dartmouth to Brest in Brittany to guarantee Allied communications links. On 20 October a warrant went out for the arrest of 23,000 Germanic aliens, and food supplies to Belgium were cut lest they fell into German hands. McKenna refused to allow the publication of the sinking of [[HMS Audacious (1912)|HMS ''Audacious'']]; in the event it was 'leaked' to [[The Evening News (London newspaper)|''The Evening News'']] anyway. And on 30 October the Cabinet announced a general policy of censorship.<ref>{{harvp|David|1977|p=204}}</ref> In the ''Wilhelmina'' case he again referred to the legal situation, seeking a solution in international law.\n\nMcKenna disliked the autocratic and dismissive [[Herbert Kitchener, 1st Earl Kitchener|Lord Kitchener]], appointed [[Secretary of State for War]] at the start of the war. Immediately on his appointment their relations soured: the policy of voluntary recruitment continued as the Army needed one million men, until the Adjutant-General complained there were too many new recruits. On 5 March 1915 McKenna reported that the [[Ritz Carlton Hotel]], New York was being used as a spy network to inform on British intelligence; the government, determined to prevent the USA entering the war on Germany's side, informed Washington.<ref>{{harvp|David|1977|p=226}}</ref> McKenna supported Asquith and gradually fell out with Lloyd George.\n\nInternal wrangling in Cabinet conversations reached fever pitch: [[Edwin Montagu]], a cousin of [[Herbert Samuel]] and ally of Lloyd George suggested that Asquith was jealous of Sir [[Edward Grey, 1st Viscount Grey of Fallodon|Edward Grey]]'s prowess in the Foreign Office. When in April 1915 the Home Secretary banned Montagu from his home for six months, the scene was set for a final split in the party. McKenna was a Teetotaller, something he had impressed upon the King was necessary for good government. His Majesty \"took the pledge\" for the duration of the war, an example which Lord Chancellor Haldane felt he had to follow for the remainder of his time in office. McKenna's asceticism won few new friends, so that when the end came for his career it was both dramatic and complete.<ref>{{harvp|David|1977|pp=238\u2013239}}</ref>\n\n=== Asquith's Liberal Chancellor ===\nIn May 1915 Asquith formed a coalition government. McKenna, a reluctant coalitionist,<ref>{{harvp|Jenkins|1998|p=197}}</ref> became [[Chancellor of the Exchequer]]. In the meantime, McKenna oversaw the issue of the Second [[War bond|War Loan]] in June 1915, at an interest rate of 4.5%, although his first budget was actually on 21 September 1915 was a serious attempt to deal with an impending debt crisis. Revenues were rising, but not by enough to cover the \u00a31.6 billion government expenditure. McKenna increased income tax rates and introduced a 50% excess profit tax, and increases in indirect taxation of goods such as tea, coffee, and tobacco.<ref name=\"Jenkinsp199\">{{harvp|Jenkins|1998|p=199}}</ref> Post Office charge increases could not be included in the Budget (as they would have endangered its status as a money bill), and were instead introduced in a Post Office and Telegraph Bill.<ref name = \"Jenkinsp199\"/>\n\n=== McKenna duties ===\n{{anchor|McKenna Duties}}\nIn September 1915 he introduced a 33{{1/3}}% levy on luxury imports in order to fund the war effort. The McKenna duties applied to cinematographic film; clocks and watches; motorcars and motorcycles; and musical instruments.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Varian|first=Brian D.|title=The growth of manufacturing protection in 1920s Britain|journal=Scottish Journal of Political Economy|language=en|volume=0|doi=10.1111/sjpe.12223|issn=1467-9485|year=2019}}</ref> The duties were revoked by [[Ramsay MacDonald]]'s short-lived Labour government in 1924, only to be reimposed in 1925.\n\n=== Fiscal relations and Lloyd George ===\nThe April 1916 budget saw further large rises in income and excess profit taxes, at a time when prices of basic food commodities were rising. Sales taxes were extended to rail tickets, mineral water, cider and perry, and entertainments. The government pledged that if they issued War Loan at the even higher interest (as they did with the 5% issue of 1917), holders of the 4.5% bonds might also convert to the new rate. His predecessor [[David Lloyd George]] criticised McKenna in his memoirs for increasing the interest rate from 3.5% on the 1914 War Loan at a time when investors had few alternatives and might even have had their capital \"conscripted\" by the government.  Not only did the change ultimately increase the nation's interest payments by \u00a3100 million/year but it meant rates were higher throughout the economy during the [[Economic history of the United Kingdom#Postwar stagnation|post-war depression]].<ref>{{cite book | first=David | last=Lloyd George | title=War Memoirs Volume I | year=1938 | publisher=Odhams Press | location=London | url=https://archive.org/details/warmemoirsvolume035284mbp | pages=73\u20134}}</ref> Compared with France, the British government relied more on short-term financing in the form of treasury bills and exchequer bonds during World War I; Treasury bills provided the bulk of British government funds in 1916.<ref name=Horn82>{{harvp|Horn|2002|loc=[https://books.google.com/books?id=H1l8CHbZG74C&lpg=PA82 p.&nbsp;82]}}</ref> McKenna fell out with [[Walter Cunliffe, 1st Baron Cunliffe|Lord Cunliffe]], [[Governor of the Bank of England]].  Furthermore, he tried to sequestrate the assets of the US Prudential Assurance Company to pay for American war ''materiel'' purchases.\n\nAn opponent of Lloyd George,<ref>{{cite book|last=Douglas|first=Roy|title=Liberals: A History of the Liberal and Liberal Democratic Parties|year=2005|publisher=Hambledon Continuum|isbn=1852853530|page=197|chapter=Politics in Chaos}}</ref> McKenna was critical of the Prime Minister's political approach, telling Conservative politician [[Arthur Balfour]] that \"you disagree with us, but you can understand our principles. Lloyd George doesn't understand them and we can't make him\".<ref>{{cite book|last=Sykes|first=Alan|title=The Rise and Fall of British Liberalism: 1776-1988|year=2014|publisher=Routledge|isbn=0582060575|chapter=Welfare, Finance and Freedom|page=156}}</ref> But unlike McKenna, Lloyd George had no problem with relations with Cunliffe.\n\nMcKenna nevertheless saw the state as having an important role in society, a sentiment that he shared with Asquith.  As noted by his biographer and nephew, [[Stephen McKenna (novelist)|Stephen McKenna]],\n\n<blockquote>Without trying to define the whole duty of Liberal man, Asquith and McKenna were at one in seeing that if certain services were not undertaken by the state, they would not be undertaken at all. Old age pensions were a case in point. They had not been dangled as an electioneering bait; Asquith made no appeal to sentiment or emotion when the Cabinet committee of investigation was set up, but from their first days together at the Treasury he and McKenna had agreed that, if the money could be found, this was a matter on which a beginning must be made forthwith.<ref>{{cite book|last=McKenna|first=Stephen|authorlink=Stephen McKenna (novelist)|title=Reginald McKenna, 1863-1943: A Memoir|year=1948|publisher=Eyre & Spottiswoode|location = London|page=46}}</ref></blockquote>\n\n=== Conscription ===\nThe issue of enforced service in the armed forces was controversial in Britain. The Conservatives were almost entirely in favour, but the Liberals were split, with Asquithians largely opposed on libertarian grounds, whilst Lloyd George united with the Tories in what he declared to be a vital national interest. Sir John Simon, Liberal Home Secretary and an ally of McKenna, resigned over the conscription of bachelors in January 1916.  As Chancellor of Exchequer McKenna objected to the conscription of married men in May 1916 on purely economic grounds, arguing that it would 'deplete' Britain's war industries.  McKenna knew that for Asquith to remain in office he had to move towards conscription, whether he liked it or not; if he did not, the Tories would topple the government.<ref>{{harvp|Jenkins|1998|pp=102\u2013103}}</ref>\n\nAt a decisive meeting on 4 December 1916 McKenna tried to persuade Asquith to sack Lloyd George to save the government. McKenna retired into opposition upon the fall of Asquith at the end of 1916.\n\n===Chairman of the Midland Bank===\nHe lost his seat in the [[1918 United Kingdom general election|1918 general election]] and became a non-executive member of the board of the [[Midland Bank]] at the invitation of the Chairman, Liberal MP [[Sir Edward Holden, 1st Baronet|Sir Edward Holden]]. Before Holden died in 1919, McKenna had sat in his office everyday to observe the activities of a chairman.  An elaborate coda was drafted to allow the bank's directors to determine whether he should resign his Pontypool seat where he was presently the Liberal candidate (his previous seat of North Monmouthshire had disappeared in boundary changes). But the situation did not arise as he was not elected in [[1922 United Kingdom general election|1922]]. The new [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Prime Minister]] [[Bonar Law]] hoped to persuade him to come out of retirement and serve once again at the Exchequer in a Conservative Cabinet, but he refused, and remained in private life.<ref name=\"harvp|Jenkins|1998|pp=203\u2013204\">{{harvp|Jenkins|1998|pp=203\u2013204}}</ref> His refusal was partly because he wanted to promote an alliance between Bonar Law and Asquith, who was still official leader of the Liberal Party.<ref>{{harvp|Jenkins|1964|p=495}}</ref> The following year Bonar Law's successor Stanley Baldwin repeated the request and McKenna was more agreeable, but again declined.<ref name=\"harvp|Jenkins|1998|pp=203\u2013204\"/>\n\nMcKenna used his status as chairman of one of the big five British banks to argue that [[monetary policy]] could be used to achieve domestic macroeconomic objectives.  At the Chamberlain-Bradbury committee he questioned whether a return to the [[gold standard]] was desirable. [[John Maynard Keynes]] was the only other witness to do so, although others proposed a delayed return.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://robertskidelsky.com/1998/02/15/the-first-100-years-a-policy-that-crippled-the-gold-standard-debate/|title=The First 100 Years: A policy that crippled: The Gold Standard debate|last=Skidelsky|first=Robert|authorlink = Robert Skidelsky|date=15 February 1998|work=robertskidelsky.com|accessdate=30 September 2019}}</ref>\n\n=== A return to Government? ===\nAccording to Lord Birkenhead Lloyd George's Liberals were of poor intellect, with no great leaders to take the government onwards. McKenna was certainly a technocrat but did not want to be Prime Minister, yet he might conceivably have been offered the post. In reality, the Conservatives wanted one of their own. However he wished to enter Parliament in July 1923 as MP for the [[City of London (UK Parliament constituency)|City of London]] and neither of the incumbent MPs would agree to vacate in order to make room. As a result, McKenna declined as he had no wish to vacate the bank. McKenna continued to write economic reports for Whitehall and Westminster, but by August 1923 his political career had come to an end. The lasting impression was one of the pin-striped merchant banker, a model of precision, but not a clubbable leader of men; his absence from London society and [[Brooks's]] seemed to imply retirement.<ref>{{harvp|Jenkins|1998|pp=205\u2013206}}</ref> However, his financial reputation was such as to prompt [[Stanley Baldwin]] to demand his return to government in the 1930s. As late as 1939 it was proposed that he should be brought back to replace [[National Liberal Party (UK, 1931)|Liberal National]] Chancellor Sir John Simon. McKenna was the last of the Asquithians to die, in 1943.<ref>{{harvp|Jenkins|1998|p=389}}</ref>\n\n==Family==\nMcKenna was married in 1908 to Pamela Jekyll (who died November 1943), younger daughter of Sir Herbert Jekyll (brother of landscape gardener [[Gertrude Jekyll]]) and his wife [[Agnes Jekyll|Dame Agnes Jekyll]], n\u00e9e Graham.<ref name=odnbMcKenna/> They had two sons \u2013 Michael (died 1931) and David, who married Lady Cecilia Elizabeth Keppel (12 April 1910 \u2013 16 June 2003), a daughter of [[Walter Keppel, 9th Earl of Albemarle]] in 1934. McKenna was a talented financier, and a champion bridge player in his free time. In royal company at Balmoral McKenna played golf.<ref>Haig, ''Diaries'', p.285-6</ref>{{Incomplete short citation|date=September 2019}}\n\nReginald McKenna died in London on 6 September 1943, and was buried at [[St Andrew's Church, Mells|St Andrew's Church]] in [[Mells, Somerset|Mells]], Somerset. His wife died two months later, and is buried beside him. McKenna was a regular client of [[Sir Edwin Lutyens]] who designed the Midland Bank headquarters in [[Poultry, London]], and several branches. Pamela McKenna was a high society hostess whose dinner parties charmed Asquith at their Lutyens-built townhouse in [[Smith Square]]. Lutyens the unofficial imperial-government architect built several homes for McKenna, and the political classes, as well as his grave.<ref>{{harvp|Jenkins|1998|pp=192\u2013193}}</ref> Lutyens was commissioned to build 36 Smith Square in 1911,<ref>{{harvp|Brown|1996|p=133}}</ref> followed by Park House in [[Mells Park]], Somerset, built in 1925.<ref>{{National Heritage List for England |num=1001150 |desc=Mells Park |accessdate=4 November 2014}}</ref> The owners of Mells Park were Sir John Horner and his wife Frances, n\u00e9e Graham, who was Agnes Jekyll's sister,<ref>{{harvp|Brown|1996|pp=108\u2013109}}</ref> and they agreed to let the park to McKenna for a nominal rent, on the understanding that he would rebuild the house.<ref>{{harvp|Brown|1996|pp=218\u2013219}}</ref> Lutyens built a final house for McKenna at Halnaker Park, in [[Halnaker]], Sussex,<ref>{{harvp|Brown|1996|p=226}}</ref> in 1938.<ref>{{National Heritage List for England |num=1026406|desc=Halnaker Park |accessdate=4 November 2014 |fewer-links=x}}</ref> Lutyens designed the McKenna family tomb in St Andrew's Church, Mells, in 1932.<ref>{{National Heritage List for England |num=1345270 |desc=Chest tomb of McKenna family |accessdate=4 November 2014 |fewer-links=x}}</ref>\n\nHis nephew [[Stephen McKenna (novelist)|Stephen McKenna]] was a popular novelist who published a biography of his uncle in 1948.\n\n==Publications==\n* (1928) ''Post-War Banking Policy: A Series of Addresses'' London: William Heinemann.\n\n==See also==\n*[[List of Cambridge University Boat Race crews]]\n*[[Liberal Government 1905-15]]\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n=== Bibliography ===\n{{refbegin|32em}}\n*{{cite book |last=Brown |first=Jane |year=1996 |title=Lutyens and the Edwardians |publisher=Viking |location=London |isbn=0-670-85871-4 |ref=harv}}\n*{{cite book |last=Asquith |first=Earl of Oxford and |year=1926 |title=Fifty Years of Parliament |url=https://archive.org/details/in.ernet.dli.2015.216116 |ref=harv}}\n*{{cite book |editor-last=David |editor-first=Edward |editorlink=Edward E.

The album was released on [[Ode Records]] in December 1968. It shows the group expanding on their early [[psychedelic rock]] style and moving toward what might be described as an early form of [[progressive rock]]. It was voted number 575 in [[Colin Larkin (writer)|Colin Larkin]]'s ''[[All Time Top 1000 Albums]]'' 3rd Edition (2000)''.'' \n\nTracks such as \"It Shall Be\" and \"Silky Sam\" demonstrate the ease with which the ensemble can incorporate [[jazz]] into their idiosyncratic form of rock, while \"Jewish\" and \"Aren't You Glad\" show the band's competence in exploiting both [[world music]] and [[Jam band|jam rock]]. \"Poor Richard,\" \"Jewish,\" and \"All the Same\" feature double tracked lead guitars played by [[Randy California]]. \n\nDuring this time the band lived together in a house in [[Topanga, California]], near [[Los Angeles]]. The album's title was also inspired by the stepson-stepfather relationship between the lead guitarist Randy California and percussionist [[Ed Cassidy]]. It alludes to the slogan \"[[The family that prays together stays together]]\", created by ad-writer Al Scalpone for the [[Family Rosary Crusade]] and popular in American and British rhetoric beginning in the 1940s.\n\nThe album's arrangements were created by [[Marty Paich]], who also arranged and conducted Spirit's eponymous debut album and their third album, ''[[Clear (Spirit album)|Clear]]'', as well as ''[[Model Shop (album)|Model Shop]]'' (the soundtrack to a film [[Model Shop (film)|of the same name]], which was recorded after \"Family\" but not released until 2004).\n\nThe album cover was shot at the Sunset Highland Motel, located at 6830 Sunset Boulevard in [[Hollywood|Hollywood, California]], just across from [[Hollywood High School]].\n\n\"Jewish\" is performed with Hebrew lyrics that are taken from the traditional song \"[[Hine Ma Tov]]\", based on King David's [[Psalm 133]].<ref name=\"bernarde-stars\">{{cite book | last = Bernarde | first = Scott | title = Stars of David: Rock'n'roll's Jewish Stories | year = 2003 | publisher = UPNE | pages = 164\u2013169 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=XI4-VnSrEcAC | accessdate = 2016-02-15 }}</ref>\n\n== Release history ==\nAfter the first issue, the [[stereo]] master tapes for this album were locked away in storage and made unavailable. Because of this, subsequent [[Compact disc|CD]] releases by [[Sony Records|Sony]], as well as the recent vinyl reissue by [[Sundazed Records]], are taken from new stereo mixes made from the original multi-track tapes by Bob Irwin, Randy California and Ed Cassidy in 1996. Liner notes on the 1996 CD reissue state that it was \"mixed and mastered by Vic Anesini, Sony Music Studios, New York\". (The tracks that appeared on the ''[[Time Circle, 1968\u20131972]]'' compilation were remixed as well, though those mixes are different.) \n\nThe 1996 CD reissue also contains five bonus tracks. Two of these appeared on the ''Time Circle, 1968\u20131972'' compilation, while the other three are previously unissued.\n\nIn 2017, Audio Fidelity reissued the album as a numbered limited edition hybrid [[Super Audio CD|SACD]]. This was the first release to use the original stereo mixes since the 1970s. This edition also includes bonus tracks in the same mixes as on the 1996 reissue.\n\n== Track listing ==\n{{Track listing\n| headline      = Side one\n| title1        = [[I Got a Line on You]]\n| writer1       = [[Randy California]]\n| length1       = 2:39\n| title2        = It Shall Be\n| writer2       = {{hlist|California|[[John Locke (musician)|John Locke]]}}\n| length2       = 3:24\n| title3        = Poor Richard\n| writer3       = [[Jay Ferguson (American musician)|Jay Ferguson]]\n| length3       = 2:31\n| title4        = Silky Sam\n| writer4       = Ferguson\n| length4       = 4:57\n| title5        = The Drunkard\n| writer5       = Ferguson\n| length5       = 2:27\n| title6        = Darlin' If\n| writer6       = California\n| length6       = 3:37\n}}\n{{Track listing\n| headline      = Side two\n| title7        = It's All The Same\n| writer7       = {{hlist|California|[[Ed Cassidy]]}}\n| length7       = 4:41\n| title8        = Jewish\n| writer8       = California\n| length8       = 3:23\n| title9        = Dream Within A Dream\n| writer9       = Ferguson\n| length9       = 3:13\n| title10       = She Smiles\n| writer10      = Ferguson\n| length10      = 2:30\n| title11       = Aren't You Glad\n| writer11      = Ferguson\n| length11      = 5:25\n}}\n{{Track listing\n| headline      = 1996 reissue bonus tracks\n| title12         = Fog (instrumental)\n| writer12        = {{hlist|Locke|Cassidy}}\n| length12        = 2:23\n| title13         = So Little To Say\n| writer13        = Ferguson\n| length13        = 2:58\n| title14         = Mellow Fellow (instrumental)\n| writer14        = Locke\n| length14        = 3:46\n| title15         = Now Or Anywhere\n| writer15        = Ferguson\n| length15        = 4:20\n| title16         = Space Chile (instrumental)\n| writer16        = Locke\n| length16        = 6:25\n}}\n\n== Personnel ==\n\n=== Spirit ===\n*[[Jay Ferguson (American musician)|Jay Ferguson]] -

The album was released on [[Ode Records]] in December 1968. It shows the group expanding on their early [[psychedelic rock]] style and moving toward what might be described as an early form of [[progressive rock]]. It was voted number 575 in [[Colin Larkin (writer)|Colin Larkin]]'s ''[[All Time Top 1000 Albums]]'' 3rd Edition (2000)''.'' \n\nTracks such as \"It Shall Be\" and \"Silky Sam\" demonstrate the ease with which the ensemble can incorporate [[jazz]] into their idiosyncratic form of rock, while \"Jewish\" and \"Aren't You Glad\" show the band's competence in exploiting both [[world music]] and [[Jam band|jam rock]]. \"Poor Richard,\" \"Jewish,\" and \"All the Same\" feature double tracked lead guitars played by [[Randy California]]. \n\nDuring this time the band lived together in a house in [[Topanga, California]], near [[Los Angeles]]. The album's title was also inspired by the stepson-stepfather relationship between the lead guitarist Randy California and percussionist [[Ed Cassidy]]. It alludes to the slogan \"[[The family that prays together stays together]]\", created by ad-writer Al Scalpone for the [[Family Rosary Crusade]] and popular in American and British rhetoric beginning in the 1940s.\n\nThe album's arrangements were created by [[Marty Paich]], who also arranged and conducted Spirit's eponymous debut album and their third album, ''[[Clear (Spirit album)|Clear]]'', as well as ''[[Model Shop (album)|Model Shop]]'' (the soundtrack to a film [[Model Shop (film)|of the same name]], which was recorded after \"Family\" but not released until 2004).\n\nThe album cover was shot at the Sunset Highland Motel, located at 6830 Sunset Boulevard in [[Hollywood|Hollywood, California]], just across from [[Hollywood High School]].\n\n\"Jewish\" is performed with Hebrew lyrics that are taken from the traditional song \"[[Hine Ma Tov]]\", based on King David's [[Psalm 133]].<ref name=\"bernarde-stars\">{{cite book | last = Bernarde | first = Scott | title = Stars of David: Rock'n'roll's Jewish Stories | year = 2003 | publisher = UPNE | pages = 164\u2013169 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=XI4-VnSrEcAC | accessdate = 2016-02-15 }}</ref>\n\n== Release history ==\nAfter the first issue, the [[stereo]] master tapes for this album were locked away in storage and made unavailable. Because of this, subsequent [[Compact disc|CD]] releases by [[Sony Records|Sony]], as well as the recent vinyl reissue by [[Sundazed Records]], are taken from new stereo mixes made from the original multi-track tapes by Bob Irwin, Randy California and Ed Cassidy in 1996. Liner notes on the 1996 CD reissue state that it was \"mixed and mastered by Vic Anesini, Sony Music Studios, New York\". (The tracks that appeared on the ''[[Time Circle, 1968\u20131972]]'' compilation were remixed as well, though those mixes are different.) \n\nThe 1996 CD reissue also contains five bonus tracks. Two of these appeared on the ''Time Circle, 1968\u20131972'' compilation, while the other three are previously unissued.\n\nIn 2017, Audio Fidelity reissued the album as a numbered limited edition hybrid [[Super Audio CD|SACD]]. This was the first release to use the original stereo mixes since the 1970s. This edition also includes bonus tracks in the same mixes as on the 1996 reissue.\n\n== Track listing ==\n{{Track listing\n| headline      = Side one\n| title1        = [[I Got a Line on You]]\n| writer1       = [[Randy California]]\n| length1       = 2:39\n| title2        = It Shall Be\n| writer2       = {{hlist|California|[[John Locke (musician)|John Locke]]}}\n| length2       = 3:24\n| title3        = Poor Richard\n| writer3       = [[Jay Ferguson (American musician)|Jay Ferguson]]\n| length3       = 2:31\n| title4        = Silky Sam\n| writer4       = Ferguson\n| length4       = 4:57\n| title5        = Drunkard\n| writer5       = Ferguson\n| length5       = 2:27\n| title6        = Darlin' If\n| writer6       = California\n| length6       = 3:37\n}}\n{{Track listing\n| headline      = Side two\n| title7        = It's All the Same\n| writer7       = {{hlist|California|[[Ed Cassidy]]}}\n| length7       = 4:41\n| title8        = Jewish\n| writer8       = California\n| length8       = 3:23\n| title9        = Dream Within a Dream\n| writer9       = Ferguson\n| length9       = 3:13\n| title10       = She Smiles\n| writer10      = Ferguson\n| length10      = 2:30\n| title11       = Aren't You Glad\n| writer11      = Ferguson\n| length11      = 5:25\n}}\n{{Track listing\n| headline      = 1996 reissue bonus tracks\n| title12         = Fog\n| writer12        = {{hlist|Locke|Cassidy}}\n| length12        = 2:23\n| title13         = So Little to Say\n| writer13        = Ferguson\n| length13        = 2:58\n| title14         = Mellow Fellow\n| writer14        = Locke\n| length14        = 3:46\n| title15         = Now or Anywhere\n| writer15        = Ferguson\n| length15        = 4:20\n| title16         = Space Chile\n| writer16        = Locke\n| length16        = 6:25\n}}\n\n== Personnel ==\n\n=== Spirit ===\n*[[Jay Ferguson (American musician)|Jay Ferguson]] - [[Lead vocalist|lead vocals]], [[Keyboard instrument|keyboards]], [[Percussion instrument|percussion]]\n*[[Randy California]] - lead guitar, lead vocals, [[Backing vocalist|backing vocals]], [[bass guitar|bass]]\n*[[John Locke (musician)|John Locke]] - keyboards\n*[[Mark Andes]] - bass, backing vocals\n*[[Ed Cassidy]] - [[Drum kit|drums]], percussion\n\n=== Production ===\n*[[Lou Adler]] - producer\n*[[Bob Irwin]] - producer\n*[[Marty Paich]] - horn arrangements, string arrangements\n*Vic Anesini - mastering, mixing (reissue)\n*Armin Stiener - engineer\n*Adam Block - project director\n*Tom Wilkes - art direction\n*Guy Webster - photography\n\n== Charts ==\n'''Album'''\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"width:550px;\"\n|-\n!align=\"left\" |Year\n!align=\"left\" |Chart\n!align=\"left\" |Position\n|-\n| 1969\n| Billboard 200\n| 22\n|-\n| 1969\n| [[RPM (magazine)|RPM Magazine Top 50]]\n| 46\n|-\n| 1972\n| Billboard 200\n| 189\n|}\n'''Singles'''\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"width:550px;\"\n|-\n!align=\"left\" |Song\n!align=\"left\" |Chart\n!align=\"left\" |Position\n|-\n| \"I Got A Line On You\"\n| [[RPM (magazine)|RPM Magazine]]\n| 28\n|}\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n{{Spirit (band)|Spirit}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Family That Plays Together}}\n[[Category:Spirit (band) albums]]\n[[Category:1968 albums]]\n[[Category:Epic Records albums]]\n[[Category:Legacy Recordings albums]]\n[[Category:Albums produced by Lou Adler]]\n[[Category:Sony Records albums]]\n[[Category:Sundazed Records albums]]\n[[Category:Albums arranged by Marty Paich]]\n", "name_user": "Robin McIlroy", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eTrack listing:detail", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Family_That_Plays_Together"}
