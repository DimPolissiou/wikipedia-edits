The L7 is a [[105 mm]] L/52 rifled design by the [[Royal Ordnance Factories]] intended for use in [[armoured fighting vehicle]]s, replacing the earlier [[Ordnance QF 20 pounder|20-pounder]] (84&nbsp;mm) tank gun mounted on the [[Centurion tank]].<ref>Starry, p. 113</ref> The successful L7 gun has been fitted on many armored vehicles including the British Centurion (starting from the Mk. 5/2 variant), the German [[Leopard 1]] and early variants of the US [[M1 Abrams]] (M1 and IPM1).\n\nThe L7 is a popular weapon and continued in use even after it was superseded by the [[Royal Ordnance L11A5|L11 series 120&nbsp;mm]] rifled tank gun, for some Centurion tanks operating as Artillery Forward Observation and Armoured Vehicle, [[Royal Engineers]] ([[Armoured Vehicle Royal Engineers|AVRE]]) vehicles. The L7, and adaptations of it, can be found as standard or retrofitted equipment on a wide variety of tanks developed during the Cold War.\n\n==History==\n[[Image:105mm tank gun Rifling.jpg|thumb|L7 105 mm tank cut gun barrel model on display at the [[Deutsches Panzermuseum]].]]\nBoth the United Kingdom and the United States had been developing projects for large calibered guns during WWII in order to compete with increasing heavily armored German, and later for [[Cold War]] Soviet tanks. The US developed several heavy tank designs during this period, notable were the US [[105 mm Gun T5]] (later renamed 105 mm Gun Motor Carriage T95) as well as the British A39 Tortoise heavy tanks.\n\nThe US foresaw difficulties in engagements against the Soviet [[IS tank family|IS-3 and 4]] with its M48 Patton. This led to the introduction of the [[M103 heavy tank|M103]], a [[heavy tank]] designed to counter [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] heavy tanks. It mounted an extremely powerful 120&nbsp;mm cannon but the ammunition was so large that it required two loaders, one for the shell and another for the separate propellant charge. Of the 300 M103s built, most went to the Marines.<ref>Hunnicut/Firepower</ref> The UK came to the same conclusions and developed their own heavy tank, the [[Conqueror (tank)|Conqueror]], which mounted the US 120&nbsp;mm gun.\n\n===United Kingdom===\nDuring the Hungarian Revolution of 1956, a Soviet T-54A medium tank was driven onto the grounds of the British embassy in Budapest by the Hungarians. After a brief examination of this tank's armor and 100 mm gun, British officials decided that the 20 pounder was apparently incapable of defeating its frontal armor. This meant the most common British tanks were no longer able to deal with Soviet medium tank designs, let alone their heavy tanks.\n\nThese events spurred the United Kingdom to develop a new tank gun in 1956, the Royal Ordnance L7 to keep the Centurion viable against this new Soviet tank design and the United States to develop the XM60 tank in 1957. The L7 was specifically designed to fit into the turret mountings of the 20 pounder. This would enable the [[Centurion (tank)|Centurion]] tanks to be up-gunned with minimum modifications; hence, the fleet could be upgraded in a shorter time and at a lower cost.\n\nUser trials of the weapon began in 1959. The first tank to be equipped with the L7 was a single up-armoured Centurion Mark 7 in 1959 which was to prove the viability of up-armouring and up-gunning the Centurion. From 1959 onwards existing Centurions were given upgrades with the L7 gun and armour and new builds incorporated the L7 at production.<ref>Dunstan p24</ref>\n\n===United States===\nThe main gun for the M60 tank series was chosen after a comparative firing test of six different guns carried out on the Aberdeen Proving Grounds in 1958. The factors evaluated were accuracy, the lethality of a hit, rate of fire, and penetration performance.{{sfn|Hunnicutt|1984|pages= 151-152 }} Based on these tests, the 105&nbsp;mm '''T254E1''' was selected, modified to the '''T254E2''' and standardized as the '''Cannon, 105-MM Gun, M68'''. They are licensed built US variants of the L7. The T254E2/M68 used a vertical sliding breechblock instead of the T254E1's horizontal breechblock. Until American-made barrels could be obtained with comparable accuracy, British X15/L52 barrels mounting a concentric bore evacuator on the barrel were to be used.{{sfn|Hunnicutt|1984|page= 155 }} US built XM24/L52 barrels (length 218.5 inches)<ref >{{cite web|url=http://www.williammaloney.com/Aviation/WatervlietArsenalMuseum/TankCannon/pages/09M68_105mmGun.htm|title=09 M68 105mm Gun|website=www.williammaloney.com|access-date=2019-05-31|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180121075334/http://www.williammaloney.com/Aviation/WatervlietArsenalMuseum/TankCannon/pages/09M68_105mmGun.htm|archive-date=2018-01-21|url-status=live}}</ref> fitted with an eccentric bore evacuator were used for the M60-series starting in June 1959 but retained interchangeability with the British X15/L52 barrel.{{sfn|Hunnicutt|1984|page= 152 }} All of the US guns and XM24 barrels were produced at the [[Watervliet Arsenal]], NY and the gun mounts (M116 for the M60 and M140 for the M60A1/A3) manufactured at the [[Rock Island Arsenal]], IL.<ref >{{cite web |url= https://www.gao.gov/assets/190/188401.pdf|title=Procurement report |date=1976 |website= www.gao.gov|access-date=2020-04-11}}</ref> US M68 guns were fitted with an eccentric bore evacuator instead of a concentric model in order to provide more clearance over the rear deck of the tank.<ref name=\"Organizational Maintenance Manual--Tank 2306\">TM 9-2350-253-20-2 Organizational Maintenance Manual--Tank, Combat, Full Tracked: 105-mm Gun, M60A3 (2350-00-148-6548) and (2350-01-061-2306) TTS Turret.

The L7 is a [[105 mm]] L/52 rifled design by the [[Royal Ordnance Factories]] intended for use in [[armoured fighting vehicle]]s, replacing the earlier [[Ordnance QF 20 pounder|20-pounder]] (84&nbsp;mm) tank gun mounted on the [[Centurion tank]].<ref>Starry, p. 113</ref> The successful L7 gun has been fitted on many armored vehicles including the British Centurion (starting from the Mk. 5/2 variant), the German [[Leopard 1]] and early variants of the US [[M1 Abrams]] (M1 and IPM1).\n\nThe L7 is a popular weapon and continued in use even after it was superseded by the [[Royal Ordnance L11A5|L11 series 120&nbsp;mm]] rifled tank gun, for some Centurion tanks operating as Artillery Forward Observation and Armoured Vehicle, [[Royal Engineers]] ([[Armoured Vehicle Royal Engineers|AVRE]]) vehicles. The L7, and adaptations of it, can be found as standard or retrofitted equipment on a wide variety of tanks developed during the Cold War.\n\n==History==\n[[Image:105mm tank gun Rifling.jpg|thumb|L7 105 mm tank cut gun barrel model on display at the [[Deutsches Panzermuseum]].]]\nBoth the United Kingdom and the United States had been developing projects for large calibered guns during WWII in order to compete with increasing heavily armored German, and later for [[Cold War]] Soviet tanks. The US developed several heavy tank designs during this period, notable were the US [[105 mm Gun T5]] (later renamed 105 mm Gun Motor Carriage T95) as well as the British A39 Tortoise heavy tanks.\n\nThe US foresaw difficulties in engagements against the Soviet [[IS tank family|IS-3 and 4]] with its M48 Patton. This led to the introduction of the [[M103 heavy tank|M103]], a [[heavy tank]] designed to counter [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] heavy tanks. It mounted an extremely powerful 120&nbsp;mm cannon but the ammunition was so large that it required two loaders, one for the shell and another for the separate propellant charge. Of the 300 M103s built, most went to the Marines.<ref>Hunnicut/Firepower</ref> The UK came to the same conclusions and developed their own heavy tank, the [[Conqueror (tank)|Conqueror]], which mounted the US 120&nbsp;mm gun.\n\n===United Kingdom===\nDuring the Hungarian Revolution of 1956, a Soviet T-54A medium tank was driven onto the grounds of the British embassy in Budapest by the Hungarians. After a brief examination of this tank's armor and 100 mm gun, British officials decided that the 20 pounder was apparently incapable of defeating its frontal armor. This meant the most common British tanks were no longer able to deal with Soviet medium tank designs, let alone their heavy tanks.\n\nThese events spurred the United Kingdom to develop a new tank gun in 1956, the Royal Ordnance L7 to keep the Centurion viable against this new Soviet tank design and the United States to develop the XM60 tank in 1957. The L7 was specifically designed to fit into the turret mountings of the 20 pounder. This would enable the [[Centurion (tank)|Centurion]] tanks to be up-gunned with minimum modifications; hence, the fleet could be upgraded in a shorter time and at a lower cost.\n\nUser trials of the weapon began in 1959. The first tank to be equipped with the L7 was a single up-armoured Centurion Mark 7 in 1959 which was to prove the viability of up-armouring and up-gunning the Centurion. From 1959 onwards existing Centurions were given upgrades with the L7 gun and armour and new builds incorporated the L7 at production.<ref>Dunstan p24</ref>\n\n===United States===\nThe main gun for the M60 tank series was chosen after a comparative firing test of six different guns carried out on the Aberdeen Proving Grounds in 1958. The factors evaluated were accuracy, the lethality of a hit, rate of fire, and penetration performance.{{sfn|Hunnicutt|1984|pages= 151-152 }} Based on these tests, the 105&nbsp;mm '''T254E1''' was selected, modified to the '''T254E2''' and standardized as the '''Cannon, 105-MM Gun, M68'''. They are licensed built US variants of the L7. The T254E2/M68 used a vertical sliding breechblock instead of the T254E1's horizontal breechblock. Until American-made barrels could be obtained with comparable accuracy, British X15/L52 barrels mounting a concentric bore evacuator on the barrel were to be used.{{sfn|Hunnicutt|1984|page= 155 }} US built XM24/L52 barrels (length 218.5 inches)<ref >{{cite web|url=http://www.williammaloney.com/Aviation/WatervlietArsenalMuseum/TankCannon/pages/09M68_105mmGun.htm|title=09 M68 105mm Gun|website=www.williammaloney.com|access-date=2019-05-31|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180121075334/http://www.williammaloney.com/Aviation/WatervlietArsenalMuseum/TankCannon/pages/09M68_105mmGun.htm|archive-date=2018-01-21|url-status=live}}</ref> fitted with an eccentric bore evacuator were used for the M60-series starting in June 1959 but retained interchangeability with the British X15/L52 barrel.{{sfn|Hunnicutt|1984|page= 152 }} All of the US guns and XM24 barrels were produced at the [[Watervliet Arsenal]], NY and the gun mounts (M116 for the M60 and M140 for the M60A1/A3) manufactured at the [[Rock Island Arsenal]], IL.<ref >{{cite web |url= https://www.gao.gov/assets/190/188401.pdf|title=Procurement report |date=1976 |website= www.gao.gov|access-date=2020-04-11}}</ref> US M68 guns were fitted with an eccentric bore evacuator instead of a concentric model in order to provide more clearance over the rear deck of the tank.<ref name=\"Organizational Maintenance Manual--Tank 2306\">TM 9-2350-253-20-2 Organizational Maintenance Manual--Tank, Combat, Full Tracked: 105-mm Gun, M60A3 (2350-00-148-6548) and (2350-01-061-2306) TTS Turret.

After making her debut in a minor role with [[Omar Sharif]] in ''[[Goha]]'' (1958), Cardinale became one of the best-known actresses in Italy after roles in films such as ''[[Rocco and His Brothers]]'' (1960), ''[[Girl with a Suitcase]]'' (1961), ''[[Cartouche (film)|Cartouche]]'' (1962),''[[The Leopard (1963 film)|The Leopard]]'' (1963),  and [[Federico Fellini|Fellini]]'s ''[[8\u00bd]]'' (1963).{{efn|''Rocco and His Brothers'', ''The Leopard'' and ''8\u00bd'' in particular are frequently ranked by directors and critics as among the [[List of films considered the best|greatest films ever made]].<ref>{{cite book|title=The Advocate |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VbIgAQAAMAAJ |date=April 1992 |publisher=Liberation Publications |page=56 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160514225244/https://books.google.com/books?id=VbIgAQAAMAAJ |archivedate=14 May 2016 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.criterion.com/explore/214-martin-scorsese-s-top-10 |title=Martin Scorsese's Top 10 |publisher=Criterion |accessdate=17 July 2015 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150721004422/http://www.criterion.com/explore/214-martin-scorsese-s-top-10 |archivedate=21 July 2015 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bfi.org.uk/news/50-greatest-films-all-time |title=50 Greatest Films of All Time |publisher=British Film Institute |accessdate=17 July 2015 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170301135739/http://www.bfi.org.uk/news/50-greatest-films-all-time |archivedate= 1 March 2017 }}</ref>}} From 1963, Cardinale became known in the United States and Britain following her role in ''[[The Pink Panther (1963 film)|The Pink Panther]]'' opposite [[David Niven]].

In 1974, Cardinale met director [[Pasquale Squitieri]], who would become her partner, and she frequently featured in his films, including ''[[I guappi]]'' (1974), ''[[Corleone (film)|Corleone]]'' (1978) and ''[[Claretta]]'' (1984), the last of which won her the [[Nastro d'Argento Best Actress|Nastro d'Argento Award for Best Actress]]. In 1982, she starred in [[Werner Herzog]]'s ''[[Fitzcarraldo]]'' as the love interest of [[Klaus Kinski]], who raises the funds to buy a steamship in [[Peru]]. In 2010, Cardinale received the Best Actress Award at the [[47th Antalya \"Golden Orange\" International Film Festival]] for her performance as an elderly Italian woman who takes in a young Turkish exchange student in ''[[Signora Enrica]]''.\n\nOutspoken on [[women's rights]] causes over the years, Cardinale has been a [[UNESCO]] goodwill ambassador for the Defense of Women's Rights since March 2000. In February 2011, the ''[[Los Angeles Times Magazine]]'' named Cardinale among the 50 most beautiful women in film history.\n\n==Early life==\nClaudia Cardinale was born Claude Jos\u00e9phine Rose Cardinale in [[La Goulette]], a neighborhood of [[Tunis]], [[French protectorate of Tunisia]], on 15 April 1938.{{Sfn|Clancy-Smith|2011|p=712}}{{sfn|Sleeman|2001|p=90}} Her mother, Yolande Greco, was born in Tunisia to [[Sicily#Demographics|Sicilian]] emigrants from [[Trapani]].{{Sfn|Cardinale|Mori|1995|p=5}} Her maternal grandparents had a small shipbuilding firm in Trapani, but later settled in La Goulette, where a large Italian community existed. Her father, Francesco Cardinale, was a railway worker, born in [[Gela]], Sicily.{{Sfn|Cardinale|Mori|1995|p=5}}  Her native languages were French, [[Tunisian Arabic]], and the [[Sicilian language]] of her parents. She did not learn to speak Italian until she had already begun to be cast for Italian films.{{Sfn|Cardinale|Mori|1995}}\n\nCardinale was educated at the Saint-Joseph-de-l'Apparition school of [[Carthage]], which she attended along with her younger sister Blanche.{{Sfn|Cardinale|Mori|1995|p=12}} She then studied at the Paul Cambon School, where she graduated with the intention of becoming a teacher.{{Sfn|Cardinale|Mori|1995|p=28}} As a teenager, she was described as \"silent, weird, and wild\", and like other girls of her generation, was fascinated by [[Brigitte Bardot]], who came to prominence in the 1956 film ''[[And God Created Woman (1956 film)|And God Created Woman]]'', directed by [[Roger Vadim]].{{Sfn|Cardinale|Mori|1995|p=19}}\n\n==Career==\n===1950s===\n[[File:Jacques Baratier.jpg|thumb|left|French film director [[Jacques Baratier]] who spotted Cardinale]]\nCardinale's first film work was participating, along with classmates, in a short film by French director [[Ren\u00e9 Vautier]], ''Anneaux d'or'', successfully presented at the [[Berlin Film Festival]]. The film made her a minor local celebrity,{{Sfn|Cardinale|Mori|1995|p=23}} and led to her being spotted by [[Jacques Baratier]], who offered her a minor role in ''[[Goha]]''. She accepted it reluctantly after Baratier explained he wanted a Tunisian actress rather than an Italian to star in the main role opposite the Egyptian actor [[Omar Sharif]]. The appearance nonetheless marked her feature-film debut.{{Sfn|Cardinale|Mori|1995|p=21}} The turning point came in 1957 during the Italian Cinema Week in Tunis, when she won a competition for the \"Most Beautiful Italian Girl in Tunisia\",{{sfn|M\u00fcller|2004|p=210}} with a trip to the [[Venice Film Festival]] as first prize. After being spotted by several film producers at the event, she was invited to study at the [[Centro Sperimentale di Cinematografia|Experimental Cinematography Center]] in Rome under [[Tina Lattanzi]]. She attended briefly as, despite her extremely photogenic looks, she had trouble with her acting assignments (partly owing to her difficulties with the Italian language).{{Sfn|Cardinale|Mori|1995|p=41}} She left at the end of her first term and decided to return home, earning herself a cover story in the popular weekly ''[[Epoca (magazine)|Epoca]]'' triggered by her unexpected decision to turn her back on a career as a film star.{{Sfn|Cardinale|Mori|1995|p=42}}{{efn|The beauty contest was meant to raise money for charity; Cardinale's mother was on the charity committee.

The comedy was a huge success, making Cardinale instantly recognizable. Some newspapers were already referring to her as \"la fidanzata d'Italia\" (Italy's sweetheart).{{Sfn|Cardinale|Mori|1995|p=55}} Later that year, she had a leading role opposite [[Yvonne Monlaur]] in [[Claudio Gora]]'s romantic comedy ''[[Three Strangers in Rome]]''.{{Sfn|Lancia|Minelli|2009|p=24}}\n[[File:Maledettoimbroglio-trio.jpg|thumb|right|Cardinale in [[Pietro Germi]]'s ''[[Un maledetto imbroglio]]'' (1959)]]\nAlthough she worked well into her seventh month, Cardinale's pregnancy was kept a tight secret. Tormented by thoughts of suicide, she fell into a state of depression.{{Sfn|Cardinale|Mori|1995|p=32}} When she thought she could no longer hide her condition, she asked Cristaldi to terminate her contract. Understanding her predicament, he sent her to London for the birth, far away from the press. He simply explained that she had gone to England to learn English for a film.{{Sfn|Cardinale|Mori|1995|p=58}} Cristaldi told Cardinale not to reveal her condition as she would be betraying the public and it would put an end to her career. So as to maintain the secret, he drew up a detailed American-style contract covering every little detail of her life, depriving her of any possibility of acting on her own behalf.{{Sfn|Cardinale|Mori|1995|p=33-4}} Cardinale explained: \"I was no longer master of my own body or thoughts. Even talking with a friend about anything that could make me look different from my public image was risky, as if it had been publicized, I would have been in trouble. Everything was in the hands of Vides\".{{Sfn|Cardinale|Mori|1995|p=52}} For seven years, Cardinale kept her secret, not only from the public, but also from her own son, Patrick, who grew up in the family with her parents and sister more or less as a brother{{sfn|Cardinale|Mori|1995|p=118}} until the day [[Enzo Biagi]], a journalist, discovered the truth.

Beyond that, for me personally, a sensitive and sincere friend.\"{{sfn|Cardinale|Mori|1995|p=144}}\nIn Bolognini's films, thanks to her aesthetic femininity,  Cardinale took roles of manipulative women who lead men to [[Eternal sin|perdition]]. During the filming of ''Il bell'Antonio'', her co-star Marcello Mastroianni fell in love with her, but she rejected him, as she did not take his love seriously, considering him to be one of those actors who cannot help but fall in love with their co-stars.{{sfn|Cardinale|Mori|1995|p=40}} Mastroianni insisted that his feelings were genuine, even after many years.{{sfn|Cardinale|Georget|2006|p=79}} The genuine empathy between the two actors proved to be ideal for reproducing the tension between the characters in the film. Cardinale next portrayed Pauline Bonaparte in [[Abel Gance]]'s French film ''[[Austerlitz (1960 film)|Napoleone ad Austerlitz]]'',{{Sfn|Lancia|Minelli|2009|p=37}} and after appearing opposite Gassman and Salvatori in the sequel to ''Big Deal on Madonna Street'', ''[[Audace colpo dei soliti ignoti]]'', she portrayed Ginetta, the fianc\u00e9e of [[Spiros Foc\u00e1s]], alongside Salvatori and [[Alain Delon]] in [[Luchino Visconti]]'s critically acclaimed ''[[Rocco and His Brothers]]''.{{Sfn|Bondanella|2001|p=197}} However, her leading performance in [[Francesco Maselli]]'s ''[[Silver Spoon Set]]'' gained her most attention during this period.{{sfn|Moliterno|2002|p=134}} Francesco Freda felt the film paved her way \"to great success\", noting the \"sweetness of her smile\" which struck a chord with the public.{{Sfn|Freda|2006|p=63}}\n[[File:La ragazza della valigia Cardinale.jpg|thumb|right|Cardinale in ''[[Girl with a Suitcase]]'' (1961)]]\nIn 1961, Cardinale portrayed a sultry [[nightclub singer]] and young mother in [[Valerio Zurlini]]'s ''[[Girl with a Suitcase]]''. As a result of her own experience of early motherhood, Cardinale naturally conveyed the concerns of a teenaged mother, identifying fully with the character of Aida.{{Sfn|Cardinale|Mori|1995|p=141-2}} Such was her psychological involvement that she needed several months to overcome her apprehensions and prepare for the part.{{sfn|Cardinale|Georget|2006|p=88}} Zurlini chose her for such a difficult role against everyone's advice, as she was not yet considered a \"real\" actress, nor was she (yet) one of the most celebrated Italian beauties.{{sfn|Cardinale|Georget|2006|p=86}} However, he was very close and supportive of Cardinale during the production, and a true friendship developed between the two, based on a deep mutual understanding. Cardinale remarked: \"Zurlini was one of those who really love women: he had an almost feminine sensitivity. He could understand me at a glance.

At the time, Cardinale was not considered comparable to the two divas of Italian cinema, [[Sophia Loren]] and [[Gina Lollobrigida]], but several newspapers and magazines including ''[[Paris Match]]'' began to consider her to be a credible young rival to Brigitte Bardot.{{sfn|Cardinale|Georget|2006|p=90}} Cardinale's 1961 appearances also included [[Henri Verneuil]]'s French comedy ''[[Les Lions sont l\u00e2ch\u00e9s]]'',{{Sfn|Audiard|Ch\u00e2teau|1995|p=57}} and ''[[Auguste (film)|Auguste]]'' in which she had a cameo role.\n\nThe following year, Cardinale starred opposite Jean-Paul Belmondo as V\u00e9nus in the 18th-century set adventure ''[[Cartouche (film)|Cartouche]]'', which made her a major star in France.{{sfn|Cardinale|Mori|1995|p=47}} She also played Angiolina, the romantic interest of [[Anthony Franciosa]] in Bolognini's ''[[Careless (film)|Senilit\u00e0]]'', a character which film writer Jacek Klinowski describes as \"a spirited and strikingly beautiful twenty-year-old\".{{Sfn|Klinowski|Garbicz|2012|p=390}} In 1962, Cardinale was interviewed by the writer [[Alberto Moravia]], who focused exclusively on her sexuality and body image in film, treating her as an object.

After making her debut in a minor role with [[Omar Sharif]] in ''[[Goha]]'' (1958), Cardinale became one of the best-known actresses in Italy after roles in films such as ''[[Rocco and His Brothers]]'' (1960), ''[[Girl with a Suitcase]]'' (1961), ''[[Cartouche (film)|Cartouche]]'' (1962),''[[The Leopard (1963 film)|The Leopard]]'' (1963),  and [[Federico Fellini|Fellini]]'s ''[[8\u00bd]]'' (1963).{{efn|''Rocco and His Brothers'', ''The Leopard'' and ''8\u00bd'' in particular are frequently ranked by directors and critics as among the [[List of films considered the best|greatest films ever made]].<ref>{{cite book|title=The Advocate |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VbIgAQAAMAAJ |date=April 1992 |publisher=Liberation Publications |page=56 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160514225244/https://books.google.com/books?id=VbIgAQAAMAAJ |archivedate=14 May 2016 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.criterion.com/explore/214-martin-scorsese-s-top-10 |title=Martin Scorsese's Top 10 |publisher=Criterion |accessdate=17 July 2015 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150721004422/http://www.criterion.com/explore/214-martin-scorsese-s-top-10 |archivedate=21 July 2015 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bfi.org.uk/news/50-greatest-films-all-time |title=50 Greatest Films of All Time |publisher=British Film Institute |accessdate=17 July 2015 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170301135739/http://www.bfi.org.uk/news/50-greatest-films-all-time |archivedate= 1 March 2017 }}</ref>}} From 1963, Cardinale became known in the United States and Britain following her role in ''[[The Pink Panther (1963 film)|The Pink Panther]]'' opposite [[David Niven]].

In 1974, Cardinale met director [[Pasquale Squitieri]], who would become her partner, and she frequently featured in his films, including ''[[I guappi]]'' (1974), ''[[Corleone (film)|Corleone]]'' (1978) and ''[[Claretta]]'' (1984), the last of which won her the [[Nastro d'Argento Best Actress|Nastro d'Argento Award for Best Actress]]. In 1982, she starred in [[Werner Herzog]]'s ''[[Fitzcarraldo]]'' as the love interest of [[Klaus Kinski]], who raises the funds to buy a steamship in [[Peru]]. In 2010, Cardinale received the Best Actress Award at the [[47th Antalya \"Golden Orange\" International Film Festival]] for her performance as an elderly Italian woman who takes in a young Turkish exchange student in ''[[Signora Enrica]]''.\n\nOutspoken on [[women's rights]] causes over the years, Cardinale has been a [[UNESCO]] goodwill ambassador for the Defense of Women's Rights since March 2000. In February 2011, the ''[[Los Angeles Times Magazine]]'' named Cardinale among the 50 most beautiful women in film history.\n\n==Early life==\nClaudia Cardinale was born Claude Jos\u00e9phine Rose Cardinale in [[La Goulette]], a neighborhood of [[Tunis]], [[French protectorate of Tunisia]], on 15 April 1938.{{Sfn|Clancy-Smith|2011|p=712}}{{sfn|Sleeman|2001|p=90}} Her mother, Yolande Greco, was born in Tunisia to [[Sicily#Demographics|Sicilian]] emigrants from [[Trapani]].{{Sfn|Cardinale|Mori|1995|p=5}} Her maternal grandparents had a small shipbuilding firm in Trapani, but later settled in La Goulette, where a large Italian community existed. Her father, Francesco Cardinale, was a railway worker, born in [[Gela]], Sicily.{{Sfn|Cardinale|Mori|1995|p=5}}  Her native languages were French, [[Tunisian Arabic]], and the [[Sicilian language]] of her parents. She did not learn to speak Italian until she had already begun to be cast for Italian films.{{Sfn|Cardinale|Mori|1995}}\n\nCardinale was educated at the Saint-Joseph-de-l'Apparition school of [[Carthage]], which she attended along with her younger sister Blanche.{{Sfn|Cardinale|Mori|1995|p=12}} She then studied at the Paul Cambon School, where she graduated with the intention of becoming a teacher.{{Sfn|Cardinale|Mori|1995|p=28}} As a teenager, she was described as \"silent, weird, and wild\", and like other girls of her generation, was fascinated by [[Brigitte Bardot]], who came to prominence in the 1956 film ''[[And God Created Woman (1956 film)|And God Created Woman]]'', directed by [[Roger Vadim]].{{Sfn|Cardinale|Mori|1995|p=19}}\n\n==Career==\n===1950s===\n[[File:Jacques Baratier.jpg|thumb|left|French film director [[Jacques Baratier]] who spotted Cardinale]]\nCardinale's first film work was participating, along with classmates, in a short film by French director [[Ren\u00e9 Vautier]], ''Anneaux d'or'', successfully presented at the [[Berlin Film Festival]]. The film made her a minor local celebrity,{{Sfn|Cardinale|Mori|1995|p=23}} and led to her being spotted by [[Jacques Baratier]], who offered her a minor role in ''[[Goha]]''. She accepted it reluctantly after Baratier explained he wanted a Tunisian actress rather than an Italian to star in the main role opposite the Egyptian actor [[Omar Sharif]]. The appearance nonetheless marked her feature-film debut.{{Sfn|Cardinale|Mori|1995|p=21}} The turning point came in 1957 during the Italian Cinema Week in Tunis, when she won a competition for the \"Most Beautiful Italian Girl in Tunisia\",{{sfn|M\u00fcller|2004|p=210}} with a trip to the [[Venice Film Festival]] as first prize. After being spotted by several film producers at the event, she was invited to study at the [[Centro Sperimentale di Cinematografia|Experimental Cinematography Center]] in Rome under [[Tina Lattanzi]]. She attended briefly as, despite her extremely photogenic looks, she had trouble with her acting assignments (partly owing to her difficulties with the Italian language).{{Sfn|Cardinale|Mori|1995|p=41}} She left at the end of her first term and decided to return home, earning herself a cover story in the popular weekly ''[[Epoca (magazine)|Epoca]]'' triggered by her unexpected decision to turn her back on a career as a film star.{{Sfn|Cardinale|Mori|1995|p=42}}{{efn|The beauty contest was meant to raise money for charity; Cardinale's mother was on the charity committee.

So as to maintain the secret, he drew up a detailed American-style contract covering every little detail of her life, depriving her of any possibility of acting on her own behalf.{{Sfn|Cardinale|Mori|1995|p=33-4}} Cardinale explained: \"I was no longer master of my own body or thoughts.

At the time, Cardinale was not considered comparable to the two divas of Italian cinema, [[Sophia Loren]] and [[Gina Lollobrigida]], but several newspapers and magazines including ''[[Paris Match]]'' began to consider her to be a credible young rival to Brigitte Bardot.{{sfn|Cardinale|Georget|2006|p=90}} Cardinale's 1961 appearances also included [[Henri Verneuil]]'s French comedy ''[[Les Lions sont l\u00e2ch\u00e9s]]'',{{Sfn|Audiard|Ch\u00e2teau|1995|p=57}} and ''[[Auguste (film)|Auguste]]'' in which she had a cameo role.\n\nThe following year, Cardinale starred opposite Jean-Paul Belmondo as V\u00e9nus in the 18th-century set adventure ''[[Cartouche (film)|Cartouche]]'', which made her a major star in France.{{sfn|Cardinale|Mori|1995|p=47}} She also played Angiolina, the romantic interest of [[Anthony Franciosa]] in Bolognini's ''[[Careless (film)|Senilit\u00e0]]'', a character which film writer Jacek Klinowski describes as \"a spirited and strikingly beautiful twenty-year-old\".{{Sfn|Klinowski|Garbicz|2012|p=390}} In 1962, Cardinale was interviewed by the writer [[Alberto Moravia]], who focused exclusively on her sexuality and body image in film, treating her as an object.

Her ship was sunk in the Indian Ocean by a German raider and she was sent with other survivors to France. That ship too was attacked and sunk, this time by a British submarine off the coast of France, and she was again rescued, causing her to describe herself as \"many times drowned\".<ref name=don99>O'Donoghue, 2014, pp. 98\u2013101.</ref>\n\nShe began to work as a journalist in Paris before moving to Berlin to make propaganda broadcasts in support of the Nazi regime. She had an intense and probably lesbian relationship there with a colleague but also suffered from loneliness and depression, and gambled and drank as much as she could leading to on-air mistakes for which she was dismissed. In Vienna in 1943/44 she worked for the ''[[Schutzstaffel]]'' (SS) watching Americans and Germans suspected of spying for the Allies. She came under suspicion by the Gestapo and was arrested but released and sent to [[Liebenau internment camp]], probably at her own request. She was returned to Britain by [[MI5]] where she was tried at the [[Old Bailey]] for assisting the enemy and jailed for 18 months. On release she worked as an international courier and later for a farm and pet shop business.\n\n==Early life==\nSusan Sweney was born in [[Trichinopoly]], British India, on 2 February 1915 to British parents with Irish connections.

The two women shared a flat in Berlin's [[Klopstockstrasse]], and drank and played billiards together. Francis Stuart and his colleagues thought they were probably in a lesbian relationship.

Such material was not common in her broadcasting, however, as the management of the station resisted the constant stream of anti-Semitic material from the central propaganda pool, feeling that it was too crude for the audience. Instead, Irland-Redaktion concentrated on anti-war and anti-British material that emphasised the importance of Irish neutrality.<ref name=don99/>\n\nIn July 1942, for instance, she broadcast:\n<blockquote>Two years ago, I was myself taken in by Admiralty Churchill's lies, when he said that the British Navy had swept the seas of Nazi ships.

She was easily led, highly volatile, a very impressionable person, generous but hot-tempered\".<ref name=don126/>\n\nSweney herself later believed that the suspicions of the Gestapo, her short trial, the narrowing of the charges purely to broadcasting, and the soft treatment she received in [[HM Prison Holloway|Holloway prison]] (her \"own room\" and a \"maid\" to look after her) were indicative that she was being used to cover up other British espionage activity that had not come to light, possibly a British female agent who had been on the ''Kemmendine'' and left when it called at Gibraltar. According to her friend Margaret Schaffhauser, it was the only way she could explain the sequence of events.<ref name=don219220>O'Donoghue, 2014, pp. 219\u2013221.</ref>\n\n==Later life==\nSweney told Margaret Schaffhauser that when she left prison, she was met at the gate by two MI5 agents who she always referred to as \"my friends\" and who went out of their way to help her, suppressing a planned book and telling her to contact them immediately if anyone said or wrote anything derogatory about her. According to Sweney, they sent her Christmas cards every year until they retired.<ref name=don219220/>\n\nShe subsequently worked as a courier to Australia and South America and later for a farm and pet shop business in England.
