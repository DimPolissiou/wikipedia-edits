By this time, almost 1million tonnes of coal had been raised, but by 1892 there was a dip in production. With debts rising, Harris allowed an inspection of the mine by Davies, whose engineers reported that   were good reserves of coal in a mine that required relatively little additional investment.<ref name=TreDist/>\n\nDavies's [[Ocean Coal Company]] took ownership of the colliery on 17 January 1893, and renamed it '''Ocean Colliery.''' There was great competition at the time between colliery owners, with most trying to prove to potential purchasers that their coal was of the best quality. At the time this was signified by being selected by the [[Royal Navy]], and the various [[Transatlantic crossing|transatlantic]] [[ocean liner]]s, including the [[Cunard line|Cunard Line]]; hence the choice of the renaming.\n\nDavies invested in the colliery, including repairing the bases of the shafts. From 1897 onwards, the colliery was producing over 590,000 tons per year with a workforce of 2,500 miners. Ocean Company invested a further \u00a3500,000 in 1900 to make the collieries production more economic, so that by 1902, annual output was 327,000 tons by 2,000 men. The steam coal produced during this period was purchased for use by the Cunard steamers [[RMS Mauretania (1906)|RMS ''Mauretania'']] and [[RMS Lusitania|RMS ''Lusitania'']], used in their successful attempts for the [[Blue Riband]] for the most rapid Atlantic passage.<ref name=WCM/>\n\nThe [[South Wales Miners' Federation]] had been formed in 1894, and in 1910 and 1911 the [[Tonypandy riots]] had occurred to improve miners incomes and working conditions. By 1913, the workforce had shrunk to 1,846 men and boys.<ref name=WCM/> At this time Deep Navigation had an extensive underground {{RailGauge|2ft}} [[mine railway]], with {{convert|10|mi}} of underground railways.<ref name=AlanGeorge/> Over 100 [[pit ponies]] were being used at the colliery, mostly underground, but some on the surface.<ref name=TreDist/>\n\n===Pit head baths===\nIn 1913, Davies sent a party of 15 men to the continent to investigate European systems of working practice. As a result of their report, a sum of \u00a38,000 was authorised to build new baths for the miners. The new Treharris baths were constructed by Nicholls & Nicholls of [[Gloucester]], that could accommodate 1,824 men at a time, who were each provided with two lockers: one for clean and the other for dirty clothes. Officially opened on 1 November 1933 by Ocean Coal Company director Thomas Evans O.B.E. of [[Pentyrch]], the baths were the first such facility in South Wales.<ref name=TreDist/>\n\nHaving constructed a new power house, which was also supplying [[Lady Windsor Colliery]], the facility was electrically lit, and included an early electric shoe cleaner. The baths were reconstructed in 1933, by which time Ocean had provided baths at Risca, Wattstown, Lady Windsor, Garw, Nantymeol and Nine mile point collieries.<ref name=TreDist/>\n\n===After World War I===\nAfter supplying the Royal Navy during World War I, by 1920 the colliery was using the \u201cBarry of Nottingham\u201d system of coal cutting, a forerunner of [[longwall mining]].<ref name=TreDist/> From a 1923 report by [[HM Inspectorate of Mines]], there were 2,328 men employed, working the Seven Feet, Yard and Nine Feet seams.<ref name=WCM/> But by the time of the [[1926 General Strike]], industrial relations had again broken down. The village of Treharris was staunchly [[socialist]], and was innovative in using the colliery band and local [[jazz music]] ''Treharris Zulus'' group to raise funds. But by the new year the families were running short of funds, food and fuel, and the workers quickly returned to work.<ref name=TreDist/> By 1935, the colliery employed 363 men on the surface and 1,875 underground.<ref name=TreDist/>\n\nAt the start of [[World War II]], [[Ernest Bevin]] introduced a new law that tied the miners to their reserved occupation. Bevin also ordered one in ten young men of eighteen years of age to be employed in the coal industry, with some of the [[Bevin boys]] coming to the Treharris area.<ref name=TreDist/>\n\n==Deep Navigation: 1947\u20131991==\nBy 1945 there were 1,826 men working at the complex.<ref name=WCM/> After nationalisation in 1947, the colliery was finally named '''Deep Navigation''' by the [[National Coal Board]].<ref name=AlanGeorge/>\n\nThe NCB made various investments in the colliery, and the fact that the [[Westminster government]] was a [[Clement Attlee]]-led [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]] government, made industrial relations smoother. Investments included the demolition in the mid-1950s of the original 1870 Twyn-y-Garreg huts, but the site remained dormant almost until the colliery closed, when the new ''Navigation Street'' was built.<ref name=TreDist/> By 1960, this investment had resulted in the workforce dropping to just over 1,000 miners.<ref name=TreDist/>\n\nBeing located close, the colliery stopped working on announcement of the [[Aberfan disaster]] on Friday 21 October 1966, sending all available manpower to the recovery effort.<ref name=TreDist/> As a result, a few children were pulled out alive in the first hour, but no survivors were found after 11&nbsp;a.m. that day.<ref>[http://www.nuffield.ox.ac.uk/politics/aberfan/chap1.htm Iain McLean & Martin Johnes: The Aberfan Disaster website]</ref>\n\nThe last [[pit pony]] was retired in 1973,<ref name=AlanGeorge/> at the time when the colliery won the first of its contracts to supply [[Aberthaw power station]]. The centenary celebrations of 1979 saw over 2,000 people descend to pit bottom, with weekly production at around 8,500 tonnes/week.<ref name=TreDist/>\n\n===A decade of industrial decline===\nAfter an investment in a new canteen in 1982, and a confirmed \u00a36million investment in 1983 in a new high-speed [[conveyor]] extraction system installed, the [[1984 Miners\u2019 Strike]] could not have been more poorly timed.\n\nAt the end of the dispute, reform was the agenda of the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] government. But the miners still hoped that the 1983 report that concluded there were at least 11 million tons of coal reserves were accessible to colliery, would keep them open. The report further suggested that development of the new \u201cGellideg\u201d seams at a depth of {{convert|2500|ft}}, would guarantee that the colliery could operate in profit for at least another 20 years.\n\nThe NCB became the privatised [[British Coal]] in 1987, but this was on the back of \u00a32 million investment in the colliery in new machinery. But an industrial dispute over required new work practices, resulted in a single pit strike that cost the company \u00a3150,000. Production resumed, but faltered again in November, a week-long strike which lost 10,000 tonnes of production.\n\nNow British Coal were warned that output was at least 5,000 tonnes below target, and that further disputes would financially jeopardise the future of the colliery. By 1989, Deep Navigation stood alone in the Taff Bargeod valley, making a profit and with coal production rising. But closure that year occurred of both the [[Taff Merthyr Colliery]] and the [[Trelewis Drift Mine]], amongst of host of closures in the South Wales Coalfield. The colliery probably survived, as despite the 1984 Miners Strike, average output that decade had reached 375,000 tons per year.<ref name=TreDist/>\n\n===Closure===\nIn 1990, Deep Navigation was not added to British Coal's list of mines for closure, with a reported profit of \u00a31million to August 1990. The colliery received a single new [[Dominion Steel and Coal Corporation|Dosco]] [[roadheader]] in March that year.<ref name=AlanGeorge/>\n\nHowever, a geological report issued in the autumn concluded that, due to structural problems in the surrounding substrata, coal reserves would only last until 1994.<ref name=TreDist/> After a period of consultation with the greatly weakened [[National Union of Mineworkers (Great Britain)|National Union of Mineworkers]], in January 1991, British Coal announced the closure of Deep Navigation from [[Good Friday]], 29 March 1991.<ref name=AlanGeorge/>\n\nThe Dosco machine was one of the few items retrieved from pit bottom to the surface.<ref name=AlanGeorge/> On Sunday 23 March, each miner was allowed to take two guests for a tour of the pit bottom circuit, where they were all presented with a commemorative medal. Deep Navigation NUM lodge provided each working and recently retired miner with a presentation [[Davy lamp]], with over 800 lamps distributed.<ref name=TreDist/>\n\nOn the last working day, the Salvation Army band under the direction of Bandmaster Thomas Fredrick Willetts marched with the last shift to the town hall, accompanied by the [[Merthyr Tydfil and Rhymney (UK Parliament constituency)|MP for Merthyr Tydfil and Rhymney]], [[Ted Rowlands]], and the [[Pontypridd (UK Parliament constituency)|MP for Pontypridd]], [[Kim Howells|Dr Kim Howells]], formally NUM South Wales research officer.<ref name=TreDist/> Deep Navigation closed with 766 men on the books.<ref name=WCM>{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/wales/coalhouse/sites/mines/pages/deep_navigation_colliery.shtml|archive-url=https://archive.today/20130419205349/http://www.bbc.co.uk/wales/coalhouse/sites/mines/pages/deep_navigation_colliery.shtml|url-status=dead|archive-date=19 April 2013|title=Deep Navigation Colliery|publisher=[[BBC Wales]]|date=15 September 2011}}</ref>\n\nThe site was cleared from 1993 onwards, but the associated [[coal washery]] stayed open for another nine months, so that a stockpile of 370,000 tonnes could be prepared for market.<ref name=TreDist/> In 1995 it took a week, working 12 hours a day, to fill the three shafts with rubble from the demolished pit head buildings.<ref name=AlanGeorge>{{cite web|url=http://www.alangeorge.co.uk/Deep-Navigation.htm|title=Deep Navigation Colliery|publisher=Alan George|accessdate=16 September 2011}}</ref>\n\n==Transport==\n[[File:Coal from Deep Navigation - geograph.org.uk - 841423.jpg|thumb|right|250px|[[British Railways]] [[British Rail Class 37|Class 37]] in charge of a [[Merry-go-round train]] group of [[Hopper car|coal hoppers]], freshly loaded from Deep Navigation Colliery, April 1987]]\nLocated adjacent to [[Quakers Yard railway station]], the colliery had access to [[Cardiff Docks]] via both the [[Great Western Railway|Great Western's]] [[Taff Vale Railway]], and the [[Midland Railway|Midland Railway's]] [[Rhymney Railway]].

The steam coal produced during this period was purchased for use by the Cunard steamers [[RMS Mauretania (1906)|RMS ''Mauretania'']] and [[RMS Lusitania|RMS ''Lusitania'']], used in their successful attempts for the [[Blue Riband]] for the most rapid Atlantic passage.<ref name=WCM/>\n\nThe [[South Wales Miners' Federation]] had been formed in 1894, and in 1910 and 1911 the [[Tonypandy Riots]] had occurred to improve miners incomes and working conditions. By 1913, the workforce had shrunk to 1,846 men and boys.<ref name=WCM/> At this time Deep Navigation had an extensive underground {{RailGauge|2ft}} [[mine railway]], with {{convert|10|mi}} of underground railways.<ref name=AlanGeorge/> Over 100 [[pit ponies]] were being used at the colliery, mostly underground, but some on the surface.<ref name=TreDist/>\n\n===Pit head baths===\nIn 1913, Davies sent a party of 15 men to the continent to investigate European systems of working practice. As a result of their report, a sum of \u00a38,000 was authorised to build new baths for the miners. The new Treharris baths were constructed by Nicholls & Nicholls of [[Gloucester]], that could accommodate 1,824 men at a time, who were each provided with two lockers: one for clean and the other for dirty clothes. Officially opened on 1 November 1933 by Ocean Coal Company director Thomas Evans O.B.E. of [[Pentyrch]], the baths were the first such facility in South Wales.<ref name=TreDist/>\n\nHaving constructed a new power house, which was also supplying [[Lady Windsor Colliery]], the facility was electrically lit, and included an early electric shoe cleaner. The baths were reconstructed in 1933, by which time Ocean had provided baths at Risca, Wattstown, Lady Windsor, Garw, Nantymeol and Nine mile point collieries.<ref name=TreDist/>\n\n===After World War I===\nAfter supplying the Royal Navy during World War I, by 1920 the colliery was using the \u201cBarry of Nottingham\u201d system of coal cutting, a forerunner of [[longwall mining]].<ref name=TreDist/> From a 1923 report by [[HM Inspectorate of Mines]], there were 2,328 men employed, working the Seven Feet, Yard and Nine Feet seams.<ref name=WCM/> But by the time of the [[1926 General Strike]], industrial relations had again broken down. The village of Treharris was staunchly [[socialist]], and was innovative in using the colliery band and local [[jazz music]] ''Treharris Zulus'' group to raise funds. But by the new year the families were running short of funds, food and fuel, and the workers quickly returned to work.<ref name=TreDist/> By 1935, the colliery employed 363 men on the surface and 1,875 underground.<ref name=TreDist/>\n\nAt the start of [[World War II]], [[Ernest Bevin]] introduced a new law that tied the miners to their reserved occupation. Bevin also ordered one in ten young men of eighteen years of age to be employed in the coal industry, with some of the [[Bevin boys]] coming to the Treharris area.<ref name=TreDist/>\n\n==Deep Navigation: 1947\u20131991==\nBy 1945 there were 1,826 men working at the complex.<ref name=WCM/> After nationalisation in 1947, the colliery was finally named '''Deep Navigation''' by the [[National Coal Board]].<ref name=AlanGeorge/>\n\nThe NCB made various investments in the colliery, and the fact that the [[Westminster government]] was a [[Clement Attlee]]-led [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]] government, made industrial relations smoother. Investments included the demolition in the mid-1950s of the original 1870 Twyn-y-Garreg huts, but the site remained dormant almost until the colliery closed, when the new ''Navigation Street'' was built.<ref name=TreDist/> By 1960, this investment had resulted in the workforce dropping to just over 1,000 miners.<ref name=TreDist/>\n\nBeing located close, the colliery stopped working on announcement of the [[Aberfan disaster]] on Friday 21 October 1966, sending all available manpower to the recovery effort.<ref name=TreDist/> As a result, a few children were pulled out alive in the first hour, but no survivors were found after 11&nbsp;a.m. that day.<ref>[http://www.nuffield.ox.ac.uk/politics/aberfan/chap1.htm Iain McLean & Martin Johnes: The Aberfan Disaster website]</ref>\n\nThe last [[pit pony]] was retired in 1973,<ref name=AlanGeorge/> at the time when the colliery won the first of its contracts to supply [[Aberthaw power station]]. The centenary celebrations of 1979 saw over 2,000 people descend to pit bottom, with weekly production at around 8,500 tonnes/week.<ref name=TreDist/>\n\n===A decade of industrial decline===\nAfter an investment in a new canteen in 1982, and a confirmed \u00a36million investment in 1983 in a new high-speed [[conveyor]] extraction system installed, the [[1984 Miners\u2019 Strike]] could not have been more poorly timed.\n\nAt the end of the dispute, reform was the agenda of the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] government. But the miners still hoped that the 1983 report that concluded there were at least 11 million tons of coal reserves were accessible to colliery, would keep them open. The report further suggested that development of the new \u201cGellideg\u201d seams at a depth of {{convert|2500|ft}}, would guarantee that the colliery could operate in profit for at least another 20 years.\n\nThe NCB became the privatised [[British Coal]] in 1987, but this was on the back of \u00a32 million investment in the colliery in new machinery. But an industrial dispute over required new work practices, resulted in a single pit strike that cost the company \u00a3150,000. Production resumed, but faltered again in November, a week-long strike which lost 10,000 tonnes of production.\n\nNow British Coal were warned that output was at least 5,000 tonnes below target, and that further disputes would financially jeopardise the future of the colliery. By 1989, Deep Navigation stood alone in the Taff Bargeod valley, making a profit and with coal production rising. But closure that year occurred of both the [[Taff Merthyr Colliery]] and the [[Trelewis Drift Mine]], amongst of host of closures in the South Wales Coalfield. The colliery probably survived, as despite the 1984 Miners Strike, average output that decade had reached 375,000 tons per year.<ref name=TreDist/>\n\n===Closure===\nIn 1990, Deep Navigation was not added to British Coal's list of mines for closure, with a reported profit of \u00a31million to August 1990. The colliery received a single new [[Dominion Steel and Coal Corporation|Dosco]] [[roadheader]] in March that year.<ref name=AlanGeorge/>\n\nHowever, a geological report issued in the autumn concluded that, due to structural problems in the surrounding substrata, coal reserves would only last until 1994.<ref name=TreDist/> After a period of consultation with the greatly weakened [[National Union of Mineworkers (Great Britain)|National Union of Mineworkers]], in January 1991, British Coal announced the closure of Deep Navigation from [[Good Friday]], 29 March 1991.<ref name=AlanGeorge/>\n\nThe Dosco machine was one of the few items retrieved from pit bottom to the surface.<ref name=AlanGeorge/> On Sunday 23 March, each miner was allowed to take two guests for a tour of the pit bottom circuit, where they were all presented with a commemorative medal. Deep Navigation NUM lodge provided each working and recently retired miner with a presentation [[Davy lamp]], with over 800 lamps distributed.<ref name=TreDist/>\n\nOn the last working day, the Salvation Army band under the direction of Bandmaster Thomas Fredrick Willetts marched with the last shift to the town hall, accompanied by the [[Merthyr Tydfil and Rhymney (UK Parliament constituency)|MP for Merthyr Tydfil and Rhymney]], [[Ted Rowlands]], and the [[Pontypridd (UK Parliament constituency)|MP for Pontypridd]], [[Kim Howells|Dr Kim Howells]], formally NUM South Wales research officer.<ref name=TreDist/> Deep Navigation closed with 766 men on the books.<ref name=WCM>{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/wales/coalhouse/sites/mines/pages/deep_navigation_colliery.shtml|archive-url=https://archive.today/20130419205349/http://www.bbc.co.uk/wales/coalhouse/sites/mines/pages/deep_navigation_colliery.shtml|url-status=dead|archive-date=19 April 2013|title=Deep Navigation Colliery|publisher=[[BBC Wales]]|date=15 September 2011}}</ref>\n\nThe site was cleared from 1993 onwards, but the associated [[coal washery]] stayed open for another nine months, so that a stockpile of 370,000 tonnes could be prepared for market.<ref name=TreDist/> In 1995 it took a week, working 12 hours a day, to fill the three shafts with rubble from the demolished pit head buildings.<ref name=AlanGeorge>{{cite web|url=http://www.alangeorge.co.uk/Deep-Navigation.htm|title=Deep Navigation Colliery|publisher=Alan George|accessdate=16 September 2011}}</ref>\n\n==Transport==\n[[File:Coal from Deep Navigation - geograph.org.uk - 841423.jpg|thumb|right|250px|[[British Railways]] [[British Rail Class 37|Class 37]] in charge of a [[Merry-go-round train]] group of [[Hopper car|coal hoppers]], freshly loaded from Deep Navigation Colliery, April 1987]]\nLocated adjacent to [[Quakers Yard railway station]], the colliery had access to [[Cardiff Docks]] via both the [[Great Western Railway|Great Western's]] [[Taff Vale Railway]], and the [[Midland Railway|Midland Railway's]] [[Rhymney Railway]].

The sheaves were not replaced at Deep Navigation until 1961 (No.2 South), and 1963 (No.1 North).<ref name=AlanGeorge/>\n\nOn 11 November 1902, five men lost their lives and two others were injured in No.2 South pit.

San Francisco Chronicle, p.E-1.</ref> Hung vertically and spaced asymmetrically with a measured and careful distance between one another,<ref name=\"Baker\" /> the display articulated Butcher's increasing awareness of, and preoccupation with, \u2018installation\u2019 in creating a total cohesive experience rather than an isolated object.<ref name=\"ericbutcher\" /> As Kenneth Baker, in his [[San Francisco Chronicle]] review, wrote of the work's interaction with the space it occupied, \u2018to walk this piece is to compose and recompose it through observation.

Vertigo Gallery, London, {{ISBN|1-903771-13-7}}.</ref> he deals with the scale and arrangement of works by Roger Ackling, [[Marc Vaux]] and Cathy Wade, as well as his own. Butcher's attempts within his own works in that exhibition to, \u2018engage the space around the painted surface\u2019<ref name=\"DefiniteArticle\" /> were similarly factors that he encountered in his curation of the exhibition as a whole, \u2018each of the artists\u2026 employs a range of techniques to encourage the viewer to engage with the work physically\u2019.<ref name=\"DefiniteArticle\" />\n[[File:Eric Butcher, GR.578.jpg|thumb|right|alt=GR.578.|GR.578 Blind embossed paper with cutouts.]]\n\n===Site-specific Installations===\nEric Butcher's site-specific installations are interventions in space. Like the intimate relationship between painted surface and objects that distinguish his work, they become 'a pause in the act or a mistake in the material'<ref name=Bildwerke>Kr\u00e4mer, Harald (2013). \"Bildwerke\", p.27. Galerie Robert Drees.</ref>, 'subtle and stunning, installed in space dispersed over corners, corridors or in staircases they become architecture in motion'.<ref name=TimeTrial16>Heide, Patrick (2019). 'Time Trial', p.16. Galerie Robert Drees, Patrick Heide Contemporary Art and Eric Butcher.</ref> This methodology can be seen in the lengths, or fragments, of aluminium that 'seem to cling to the wall [in his installations]. In part driven by chance, and yet still composed according to a strict order'.<ref name=Bildwerke /> The context of these installations have become increasingly important, 'determined by aspects of its context; both its physical environment and psychological purpose'<ref name=TimeTrial>Butcher, Eric (2019). 'Time Trial', p.89. Galerie Robert Drees, Patrick Heide Contemporary Art and Eric Butcher.</ref> as Butcher says in his recent catalogue, Time Trial. 'As soon as I started to consider the intersections between surfaces and the wall, I was naturally, logically led to a consideration of the whole environmental context of the work and hence to site-specificity.'<ref name=TimeTrial /> This mirrors his approach to the objects he works with, the 'relationship between the painted surface and the object (upon which one surface has been singled out for preferential treatment), between 'surface' and 'objectness'.<ref name=TimeTrial68>Butcher, Eric (2019). 'Time Trial', p.68. Galerie Robert Drees, Patrick Heide Contemporary Art and Eric Butcher.</ref> \n\nAlthough the components of these installations appear to 'cling to the wall'<ref name=Bildwerke />, the evidence of their fixings are increasingly integral to the installation, 'how a piece fixes to the wall, its method of construction, the way in which the work is joined together and adhered to its backing; I want this to be clear and evident. Bolts and fixings are used which in some cases pierce the painted surfaces'.<ref name=TimeTrial65>Butcher, Eric (2019). 'Time Trial', p.65. Galerie Robert Drees, Patrick Heide Contemporary Art and Eric Butcher.</ref>\n\n===Paperworks===\nAs a consequence of this preoccupation with installation, some of Butcher's most recent pieces, his works on paper, experiment diagrammatically with possible arrangements for his large-scale installations of aluminium pieces, 'they repeat\nthe principle of the aluminium works in their own specific way'<ref name=Bildwerke /> introducing elements of chance.<ref name=\"ConversationWith\">\u201dA Conversation With Jagjit Chuhan\u201d, p. 77. Centre for Art International Research, Liverpool, {{ISBN|978-0-9557360-4-9}}.</ref> In these paper works, impressions of metal plates are embossed into sheets of saturated paper by running it through a printing press.<ref>\u201dA Conversation With Jagjit Chuhan\u201d, p. 80. Centre for Art International Research, Liverpool, {{ISBN|978-0-9557360-4-9}}.</ref> Some sections of the plates\u2019 impressions are then highlighted by ink, whereas some sections are cut out altogether \u2013 some left purely as a trace.<ref name=\"ConversationWith\" /> 'These interventions take place separated from one another, yet may also intertwine. Through these perforations, the wall which is behind the deckle edged paper becomes a component of the work and takes on a bigger or smaller role depending on the size and quantity of perforations'.<ref name=Bildwerke /> Butcher refers to this register of trace in his paper works as speaking, metaphorically, of loss and absence.<ref>\u201dA Conversation With Jagjit Chuhan\u201d, p. 81. Centre for Art International Research, Liverpool, {{ISBN|978-0-9557360-4-9}}.</ref>\n\nShortly after the death if his father, Butcher created a series of works from gunpowder residue and clay on burnt paper. These found 'drawings' on paper were from 'spent fireworks cartridges from a beach display [that] had been casually tossed into the sea'<ref> name=richnessrightness />\"Eric Butcher: Richness in Rightness\" Carey-Kent, Paul, p.124. Galerie Robert Dress, Patrick Heide Contemporary Art, {{ISBN|978-1-5272-5156-4}}</ref>. 'Eric started to gather them up for more suitable disposal. Then he became interested in how the spent energy had left its marks, especially as those traces were \u2013 in line with the aims of his wider practice \u2013 free from the subjectivity of creative decision making'.<ref name=richnessrightness /> \n\nIt is also apparent that the artist is re-evaluating his own resources in his use of paper, taking environmental concerns into the work itself. As he says in his recent Time Trial catalogue, '[in] trying to consume less, tread more lightly on the planet, it would be curiously contradictory not to impose the same logic of questioning on my work. Aluminium production is an energy intensive business, so I am increasingly using recycled and reused materials'.<ref>\"Time Trial\", Butcher, Eric, p.124.

A Machine Aesthetic (co-curated with Sim\u00f3n Granell), was a major national touring exhibition presenting the work of 11 contemporary British artists whose creative practices engaged with the concept of mechanisation. The exhibition explored the various manifestations, uses and influences of different aspects of mechanisation within the practices of an otherwise diverse group of artists (with [[Andrew Bracey]], Eric Butcher, David Connearn, Rob Currie, Paul Goodfellow, Sim\u00f3n Granell, [[Emma Hart (artist)]], Dan Hays, Natasha Kidd, Tim Knowles, Michael Roberts). In conjunction with the exhibition, the curators guest edited an edition of the arts and culture magazine Garageland (issue XVI: Machines)<ref>[https://www.transitiongallery.co.uk/htmlpages/editions/GL16/intro.htm \"Garageland: issue XVI: Machines\" {{ISSN|1749-9267}}.</ref>, which was themed to coincide with the show.\n\n\n==Further reading==\n*Butcher Shines at Toomey Tourell, Kenneth Baker, San Francisco Chronicle, pg.

Its geometry and built-in illusionism dictate that it cannot be seen whole\u2019.<ref name=\"Baker\" /> This can also be said of Butcher's curatorial practice, where, as in the Definite Article exhibition curated by the artist himself,<ref>\u201dDefinite Article, Objects and Surfaces, Eric Butcher\u201d, p.3. Vertigo Gallery, London, {{ISBN|1-903771-13-7}}.</ref> he deals with the scale and arrangement of works by Roger Ackling, [[Marc Vaux]] and Cathy Wade, as well as his own. Butcher's attempts within his own works in that exhibition to, \u2018engage the space around the painted surface\u2019<ref name=\"DefiniteArticle\" /> were similarly factors that he encountered in his curation of the exhibition as a whole, \u2018each of the artists\u2026 employs a range of techniques to encourage the viewer to engage with the work physically\u2019.<ref name=\"DefiniteArticle\" />\n[[File:Eric Butcher, GR.578.jpg|thumb|right|alt=GR.578.|GR.578 Blind embossed paper with cutouts.]]\n\n===Site-specific Installations===\nEric Butcher's site-specific installations are interventions in space. Like the intimate relationship between painted surface and objects that distinguish his work, they become 'a pause in the act or a mistake in the material'<ref name=Bildwerke>Kr\u00e4mer, Harald (2013). \"Bildwerke\", p.27. Galerie Robert Drees.</ref>, 'subtle and stunning, installed in space dispersed over corners, corridors or in staircases they become architecture in motion'.<ref name=TimeTrial16>Heide, Patrick (2019). 'Time Trial', p.16. Galerie Robert Drees, Patrick Heide Contemporary Art and Eric Butcher.</ref> This methodology can be seen in the lengths, or fragments, of aluminium that 'seem to cling to the wall [in his installations]. In part driven by chance, and yet still composed according to a strict order'.<ref name=Bildwerke /> The context of these installations have become increasingly important, 'determined by aspects of its context; both its physical environment and psychological purpose'<ref name=TimeTrial>Butcher, Eric (2019). 'Time Trial', p.89. Galerie Robert Drees, Patrick Heide Contemporary Art and Eric Butcher.</ref> as Butcher says in his recent catalogue, Time Trial. 'As soon as I started to consider the intersections between surfaces and the wall, I was naturally, logically led to a consideration of the whole environmental context of the work and hence to site-specificity.'<ref name=TimeTrial /> This mirrors his approach to the objects he works with, the 'relationship between the painted surface and the object (upon which one surface has been singled out for preferential treatment), between 'surface' and 'objectness'.<ref name=TimeTrial68>Butcher, Eric (2019). 'Time Trial', p.68. Galerie Robert Drees, Patrick Heide Contemporary Art and Eric Butcher.</ref> \n\nAlthough the components of these installations appear to 'cling to the wall'<ref name=Bildwerke />, the evidence of their fixings are increasingly integral to the installation, 'how a piece fixes to the wall, its method of construction, the way in which the work is joined together and adhered to its backing; I want this to be clear and evident. Bolts and fixings are used which in some cases pierce the painted surfaces'.<ref name=TimeTrial65>Butcher, Eric (2019). 'Time Trial', p.65. Galerie Robert Drees, Patrick Heide Contemporary Art and Eric Butcher.</ref>\n\n===Paperworks===\nAs a consequence of this preoccupation with installation, some of Butcher's most recent pieces, his works on paper, experiment diagrammatically with possible arrangements for his large-scale installations of aluminium pieces, 'they repeat\nthe principle of the aluminium works in their own specific way'<ref name=Bildwerke /> introducing elements of chance.<ref name=\"ConversationWith\">\u201dA Conversation With Jagjit Chuhan\u201d, p. 77. Centre for Art International Research, Liverpool, {{ISBN|978-0-9557360-4-9}}.</ref> In these paper works, impressions of metal plates are embossed into sheets of saturated paper by running it through a printing press.<ref>\u201dA Conversation With Jagjit Chuhan\u201d, p. 80. Centre for Art International Research, Liverpool, {{ISBN|978-0-9557360-4-9}}.</ref> Some sections of the plates\u2019 impressions are then highlighted by ink, whereas some sections are cut out altogether \u2013 some left purely as a trace.<ref name=\"ConversationWith\" /> 'These interventions take place separated from one another, yet may also intertwine. Through these perforations, the wall which is behind the deckle edged paper becomes a component of the work and takes on a bigger or smaller role depending on the size and quantity of perforations'.<ref name=Bildwerke /> Butcher refers to this register of trace in his paper works as speaking, metaphorically, of loss and absence.<ref>\u201dA Conversation With Jagjit Chuhan\u201d, p. 81. Centre for Art International Research, Liverpool, {{ISBN|978-0-9557360-4-9}}.</ref>\n\nIt is also apparent that the artist is re-evaluating his own resources in his use of paper, taking environmental concerns into the work itself. As he says in his recent Time Trial catalogue, '[in] trying to consume less, tread more lightly on the planet, it would be curiously contradictory not to impose the same logic of questioning on my work. Aluminium production is an energy intensive business, so I am increasingly using recycled and reused materials'.<ref>\"Time Trial\", Butcher, Eric, p.124.

A Machine Aesthetic (co-curated with Sim\u00f3n Granell), was a major national touring exhibition presenting the work of 11 contemporary British artists whose creative practices engaged with the concept of mechanisation. The exhibition explored the various manifestations, uses and influences of different aspects of mechanisation within the practices of an otherwise diverse group of artists (with [[Andrew Bracey]], Eric Butcher, David Connearn, Rob Currie, Paul Goodfellow, Sim\u00f3n Granell, [[Emma Hart (artist)]], Dan Hays, Natasha Kidd, Tim Knowles, Michael Roberts). In conjunction with the exhibition, the curators guest edited an edition of the arts and culture magazine Garageland (issue XVI: Machines)<ref>[https://www.transitiongallery.co.uk/htmlpages/editions/GL16/intro.htm \"Garageland: issue XVI: Machines\" {{ISSN|1749-9267}}.</ref>, which was themed to coincide with the show.\n\n\n==Further reading==\n*Butcher Shines at Toomey Tourell, Kenneth Baker, San Francisco Chronicle, pg.

It is the southwesternmost point of Portugal and of mainland [[Europe]].\n\n== History ==\nCape St. Vincent was already sacred ground in [[Neolithic]] times, as standing [[menhir]]s in the neighborhood attest. The [[Ancient Greece|ancient Greeks]] called it [[Ophiussa]] (Land of [[Serpent (symbolism)|Serpents]]), inhabited by the [[Oestriminis]] and dedicated here a temple to [[Heracles]]. The [[Ancient Rome|Romans]] called it ''Promontorium Sacrum'' (or Holy Promontory). Strabo, in his [[Geography]] calls this cape the most western tip of the known world and reports the place was considered magical. Common people believed the sun sank here hissing into the ocean, marking the edge of their world, which Strabo qualifies as \"common and vulgar reports\" and attributes to [[Posidonius]] <ref>[[Strabo]], [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0239%3Abook%3D3 Geography, III]</ref>\n\nAccording to legend, the name of this cape is linked to the story of a martyred fourth-century Iberian [[deacon]] [[Vincent of Saragossa|St. Vincent]] whose body was brought ashore here. A shrine was erected over his grave; according to the Arab [[geographer]] [[Al-Idrisi]], it was always guarded by [[raven]]s and is therefore named by him \u0643\u0646\u064a\u0633\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u063a\u0631\u0627\u0628 (''Kan\u012bsah al-Ghur\u0101b'', meaning \"Church of the Raven\").  King [[Afonso Henriques]] (1139\u20131185) had the body of the saint exhumed in 1173 and brought it by ship to [[Lisbon]], still accompanied by the ravens.  This transfer of the relics is depicted on the [[coat of arms of Lisbon]].\n\nThe area around the cape was plundered several times by pirates from France and Holland and, in 1587, by Sir [[Francis Drake]]. All existing buildings\u2014including the ''Vila do Infante'' of [[Henry the Navigator]]\u2014fell into ruins because of the [[Lisbon earthquake]] of 1755. The [[Franciscan]] [[friar]]s who cared for the shrine stayed on until 1834, when all monasteries were disbanded in Portugal.\n\n===Naval battles===\nSeveral naval battles have been fought in the vicinity of this cape:\n* In 1337, a Castilian fleet defeated a Portuguese fleet in the [[Battle of Cape St. Vincent (1337)]].\n* In 1606, a Spanish fleet defeated a Dutch fleet in the [[Battle of Cape St. Vincent (1606)]].\n* In 1641, a Spanish fleet defeated a Dutch fleet in the [[Battle of Cape St. Vincent (1641)]].\n* In 1681, a Spanish fleet defeated a Brandenburger fleet in the [[Action of 30 September 1681]].\n* In 1693, a French fleet  defeated an Anglo-Dutch fleet in the [[Battle of Lagos (1693)]].\n* In 1719, a Spanish fleet defeated a British fleet in the [[Battle of Cape St. Vincent (1719)]].\n* In 1751, a Spanish fleet defeated an Algerian fleet in the [[Action of 28 November 1751]].\n* In 1780, a British fleet defeated a Spanish fleet in the [[Battle of Cape St. Vincent (1780)]].\n* In 1797, a British fleet defeated a Spanish fleet in the [[Battle of Cape St Vincent (1797)]].<ref>https://www.thegazette.co.uk/London/issue/14012/page/474</ref>  \n* In 1833, a Loyalist fleet defeated a Miguelite fleet in the [[Battle of Cape St. Vincent (1833)]].\n\n==Geography==\n\nThis cape is the southwesternmost point in Portugal. It forms the southwestern end of the [[E9 European Coastal Path]], which runs for {{convert|5000|km|mi|abbr=on}} to [[Narva-J\u00f5esuu]] in [[Estonia]]. Approximately six kilometers from the village of Sagres, the cape is a landmark for a ship traveling to or from the [[Mediterranean]]. The cliffs rise nearly vertically from the Atlantic to a height of 75 meters. The cape is a site of exuberant marine life and a high concentration of birds nesting on the cliffs, such as the rare [[Bonelli's eagle]], [[peregrine falcon]]s, [[Kite (bird)|kites]], [[rock thrush]]es, [[rock pigeon]]s, [[stork]]s and [[Ardea (genus)|herons]].\n\n{{main|Lighthouse of Cabo de S\u00e3o Vicente}}\nThe present lighthouse is {{convert|24|m|ft}} high and was built over the ruins of a 16th-century [[Franciscan]] convent in 1846.<ref name=\"SIPA\">{{citation |url=http://www.monumentos.pt/Site/APP_PagesUser/SIPA.aspx?id=16894 |title=Fortaleza do Cabo de S\u00e3o Vicente/Convento do Corvo/Convento de S\u00e3o Vicente do Cabo/Farol de S\u00e3o Vicente (IPA.00002891/PT050815040005) |publisher=SIPA \u2013 Sistema de Informa\u00e7\u00e3o para o Patrim\u00f3nio Arquitect\u00f3nico |editor=SIPA |location=Lisbon, Portugal |language=Portuguese |first=Jo\u00e3o |last=Neto |first2=Ant\u00f3nio |last2=Xavier |year=1998 |accessdate=2 August 2016 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160818075259/http://www.monumentos.pt/Site/APP_PagesUser/SIPA.aspx?id=16894 |archivedate=18 August 2016 }}</ref> The statues of [[Vincent of Saragossa|St. Vincent]] and St. [[Francis Xavier]] had been moved to church of Nossa Senhora da Gra\u00e7a on [[Sagres Point|Point Sagres]] {{convert|3|km|mi}} away.<ref name=SIPA/> This lighthouse, guarding one of the world's busiest shipping lanes, is among the most powerful in Europe (the most powerful being [[Phare du Creach]] on the French island of [[Ushant]], off the coast of [[Brittany]]); its two 1,000&nbsp;W lamps can be seen as far as {{convert|60|km|mi}} away.<ref name=SIPA/>\n==Gallery==\n<gallery>\nFile:Cape St. Vincent (1879) - TIMEA.jpg|An 1879 sketch of the St. Vincent lighthouse\nFile:Cabo Sao Vicente (25581534256).jpg|The cliffs of the St. Vincent coast\nFile:Algarve_coast.jpg|An aerial view of the southwestern St. Vincent coast\nFile:Cape St. Vincent Lighthouse.jpg|Cape St. Vincent lighthouse\n</gallery>\n\n==References==\n===Notes===\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n===Sources===\n* {{citation |title=The Rough Guide to Portugal |edition=11th |date=March 2005 |isbn=1-84353-438-X}}\n* {{citation |last=Rentes de Carvalho |first=J. |title=Portugal, um guia para amigos |language=Portuguese |publisher=Arbeiderspers |location=Amsterdam |edition=9th |date=August 1999 |isbn=90-295-3466-4}}\n\n{{commonscat|Cabo de S\u00e3o Vicente}}\n{{Authority control}}\n\n[[Category:Geography of the Algarve]]\n[[Category:Headlands of Portugal|Sao Vicente, Cabo de]]\n[[Category:Cliffs of Portugal|Sao Vicente, Cabo de]]\n[[Category:Locations in Greek mythology]]\n[[Category:Tourist attractions in the Algarve]]\n", "text_old": "{{Redirect|Cape St Vincent}}\n{{Infobox mountain range\n<!-- *** Heading *** -->\n| name                     = Cape St. Vincent\n| native_name              = Cabo de S\u00e3o Vicente\n| other_name               =\n<!-- *** Names **** -->\n| etymology                = [[Vincent of Saragossa]]\n<!-- *** Image *** -->\n| photo                    = SaoVicente.JPG\n| photo_caption            = North shore of Cape St. Vincent as seen from the lighthouse\n| photo_size               = 235\n<!-- *** Country *** -->\n| country                  = {{flag|Portugal}}\n| state_type               = Region\n| state                    = [[Algarve]]\n| region_type              = Subregion\n| region                   = [[Algarve]]\n| district                 = [[Faro (district)|Faro]]\n| city_type             = Municipality\n| city             = [[Sagres (Vila do Bispo)|Sagres]]\n<!-- *** Locations *** -->\n| highest                  = Cabo de S\u00e3o Vicente\n| highest_location         = [[Southwest Alentejo and Vicentine Coast Natural Park]]\n| elevation_m              = \n| coordinates              = {{coord|37|1|30|N|8|59|40|W|type:mountain_scale:100000|format=dms|display=inline,title}}\n| length_km                =\n| length_orientation       =\n| width_km                 =\n| width_orientation        =\n| area_km2                 =\n<!-- *** Features *** -->\n| geology                  =\n| orogeny                  =\n| period                   =\n<!-- *** Maps *** -->\n| map                      = Portugal\n| map_caption              = Location of the Cabo de S\u00e3o Vicente in continental Portugal\n}}\n'''Cape St. Vincent''' ({{lang-pt|Cabo de S\u00e3o Vicente}}, {{IPA-pt|\u02c8kabu d\u0268 s\u0250\u0303w\u0303 vi\u02c8s\u1ebdt\u0268}}) is a [[Headlands and bays|headland]] in the [[Municipalities of Portugal|municipality]] of [[Vila do Bispo]], in the [[Algarve]], southern [[Portugal]].

The [[Ancient Rome|Romans]] called it ''Promontorium Sacrum'' (or Holy Promontory). Strabo, in his [[Geography]] calls this cape the most western tip of the known world and reports the place was considered magical. Common people believed the sun sank here hissing into the ocean, marking the edge of their world, which Strabo qualifies as \"common and vulgar reports\" and attributes to [[Posidonius]] <ref>[[Strabo]], [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0239%3Abook%3D3 Geography, III]</ref>\n\nAccording to legend, the name of this cape is linked to the story of a martyred fourth-century Iberian [[deacon]] [[Vincent of Saragossa|St. Vincent]] whose body was brought ashore here. A shrine was erected over his grave; according to the Arab [[geographer]] [[Al-Idrisi]], it was always guarded by [[raven]]s and is therefore named by him \u0643\u0646\u064a\u0633\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u063a\u0631\u0627\u0628 (''Kan\u012bsah al-Ghur\u0101b'', meaning \"Church of the Raven\").  King [[Afonso Henriques]] (1139\u20131185) had the body of the saint exhumed in 1173 and brought it by ship to [[Lisbon]], still accompanied by the ravens.  This transfer of the relics is depicted on the [[coat of arms of Lisbon]].\n\nThe area around the cape was plundered several times by pirates from France and Holland and, in 1587, by Sir [[Francis Drake]]. All existing buildings\u2014including the ''Vila do Infante'' of [[Henry the Navigator]]\u2014fell into ruins because of the [[Lisbon earthquake]] of 1755. The [[Franciscan]] [[friar]]s who cared for the shrine stayed on until 1834, when all monasteries were disbanded in Portugal.\n\n===Naval battles===\nSeveral naval battles were fought in the vicinity of this cape:\n* In 1337 a Castilian fleet defeated a Portuguese fleet in the [[Battle of Cape St. Vincent (1337)]].\n* In 1606 during the [[Dutch Revolt]] a Spanish fleet defeats a Dutch fleet in the [[Battle of Cape St. Vincent (1606)]].\n* In 1641 during the Dutch Revolt a Spanish fleet under the [[Juan Alonso Idi\u00e1quez, 2nd Duke of Ciudad Real|2nd Duke of Ciudad Real]] defeats again a Dutch fleet in the [[Battle of Cape St. Vincent (1641)]].\n* In 1681 a Spanish fleet under Marquess of Villafiel defeated a Brandenburguese squadron under Thomas Alders in the [[Action of 30 September 1681]]\n* The French Admiral [[Anne Hilarion de Tourville]] defeated a large Anglo-Dutch naval fleet commanded by [[George Rooke]] escorting a convoy of between 400 and 500 English and Dutch merchant ships at the [[Battle of Lagos (1693)|Battle of Lagos]] on 27 June 1693.  The \"Smyrna fleet\" disaster, as it also came to be known, saw 94 of the richly-laden merchant ships either captured or sunk; this event led to the dismissal of two English admirals whose convoy escort had turned back off [[Ushant]], [[France]].\n* In 1719 a Spanish fleet under Admiral Rodrigo de Torres defeated a British squadron under Commodore Philip Cavendish in the [[Battle of Cape St. Vincent (1719)]]\n* The [[Action of 28 November 1751]] took place off Cape St. Vincent and was a Spanish victory over an Algerian squadron.\n* In 1780, this cape was the site of the [[Battle of Cape St. Vincent (1780)]] between a British fleet under Admiral Sir George Rodney over a Spanish squadron under Don Juan de L\u00e1ngara\n* Admiral [[John Jervis, 1st Earl of St Vincent|Jervis]] with Commodore [[Horatio Nelson, 1st Viscount Nelson|Nelson]] defeated the Spanish fleet in 1797 at a second [[Battle of Cape St Vincent (1797)|Battle of Cape St. Vincent]] on 14 February 1797. [[St. Vincent Street]] in [[Glasgow]] was named to commemorate the battle.  Jervis was raised to the peerage as the 1st Earl St Vincent and Baron Jervis in May.<ref>https://www.thegazette.co.uk/London/issue/14012/page/474</ref>  \n* In 1833, in the [[Battle of Cape St. Vincent (1833)]] a Loyalist Portuguese fleet defeated the Miguelites during Portugal's [[Liberal Wars]].\n\n==Geography==\n\nThis cape is the southwesternmost point in Portugal. It forms the southwestern end of the [[E9 European Coastal Path]], which runs for {{convert|5000|km|mi|abbr=on}} to [[Narva-J\u00f5esuu]] in [[Estonia]]. Approximately six kilometers from the village of Sagres, the cape is a landmark for a ship traveling to or from the [[Mediterranean]]. The cliffs rise nearly vertically from the Atlantic to a height of 75 meters. The cape is a site of exuberant marine life and a high concentration of birds nesting on the cliffs, such as the rare [[Bonelli's eagle]], [[peregrine falcon]]s, [[Kite (bird)|kites]], [[rock thrush]]es, [[rock pigeon]]s, [[stork]]s and [[Ardea (genus)|herons]].\n\n{{main|Lighthouse of Cabo de S\u00e3o Vicente}}\nThe present lighthouse is {{convert|24|m|ft}} high and was built over the ruins of a 16th-century [[Franciscan]] convent in 1846.<ref name=\"SIPA\">{{citation |url=http://www.monumentos.pt/Site/APP_PagesUser/SIPA.aspx?id=16894 |title=Fortaleza do Cabo de S\u00e3o Vicente/Convento do Corvo/Convento de S\u00e3o Vicente do Cabo/Farol de S\u00e3o Vicente (IPA.00002891/PT050815040005) |publisher=SIPA \u2013 Sistema de Informa\u00e7\u00e3o para o Patrim\u00f3nio Arquitect\u00f3nico |editor=SIPA |location=Lisbon, Portugal |language=Portuguese |first=Jo\u00e3o |last=Neto |first2=Ant\u00f3nio |last2=Xavier |year=1998 |accessdate=2 August 2016 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160818075259/http://www.monumentos.pt/Site/APP_PagesUser/SIPA.aspx?id=16894 |archivedate=18 August 2016 }}</ref> The statues of [[Vincent of Saragossa|St. Vincent]] and St. [[Francis Xavier]] had been moved to church of [[Nossa Senhora da Gra\u00e7a (Sagres Point)|Nossa Senhora da Gra\u00e7a]] on [[Sagres Point|Point Sagres]] {{convert|3|km|mi}} away.<ref name=SIPA/> This lighthouse, guarding one of the world's busiest shipping lanes, is among the most powerful in Europe (the most powerful being [[Phare du Creach]] on the French island of [[Ushant]], off the coast of [[Brittany]]); its two 1,000&nbsp;W lamps can be seen as far as {{convert|60|km|mi}} away.<ref name=SIPA/>\n==Gallery==\n<gallery>\nFile:Cape St. Vincent (1879) - TIMEA.jpg|An 1879 sketch of the St. Vincent lighthouse\nFile:Cabo Sao Vicente (25581534256).jpg|The cliffs of the St. Vincent coast\nFile:Algarve_coast.jpg|An aerial view of the southwestern St. Vincent coast\nFile:Cape St. Vincent Lighthouse.jpg|Cape St. Vincent lighthouse\n</gallery>\n==See also==\n* [[2007 Iberian Peninsula earthquake]]\n\n==References==\n===Notes===\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n===Sources===\n* {{citation |title=The Rough Guide to Portugal |edition=11th |date=March 2005 |isbn=1-84353-438-X}}\n* {{citation |last=Rentes de Carvalho |first=J. |title=Portugal, um guia para amigos |language=Portuguese |publisher=Arbeiderspers |location=Amsterdam |edition=9th |date=August 1999 |isbn=90-295-3466-4}}\n\n{{commonscat|Cabo de S\u00e3o Vicente}}\n{{Authority control}}\n\n[[Category:Geography of the Algarve]]\n[[Category:Headlands of Portugal|Sao Vicente, Cabo de]]\n[[Category:Cliffs of Portugal|Sao Vicente, Cabo de]]\n[[Category:Locations in Greek mythology]]\n[[Category:Tourist attractions in the Algarve]]\n", "name_user": "Snagemit", "label": "safe", "comment": "Rephrasing section", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cape_St._Vincent"}

For instance in ninth-century Spain \u27e8saeculum\u27e9 was simply the correct way to spell [sjeglo], meaning 'century'. The writer would not have actually said [s\u025bkulum] any more than a modern English speaker would pronounce \u27e8knight\u27e9 as *[kn\u026axt].<ref>Wright (1982), pp. 44\u201350</ref> \n\n[[Ecclesiastical Latin]], in its spoken form, was created later during the [[Carolingian Renaissance]]. The British scholar [[Alcuin]], tasked by [[Charlemagne]] with improving the standards of Latin writing in France, prescribed a pronunciation based on a fairly literal interpretation of Latin spelling. A word such as \u27e8viridiarium\u27e9 'orchard' now had to be read aloud precisely as it was spelled rather than as [[Old French]] ''vergier.''<ref>Wright (1982), pp. 104\u20137</ref>\n\nThis had the effect of rendering [[Sermon|sermons]] competely unintelligible to the general public, which prompted officials a few years later at the [[Council of Tours]] to order sermons to be rendered ''in rusticam romanam linguam'', 'in plain roman speech'.<ref>Wright (1982), pp. 118-20</ref> Another issue was that now two types of speech, Romance and Church Latin, had to coexist within one writing system. Within the same century the first attempts were made to devise an orthography specifically for Romance, as can be seen in the [[Oaths of Strasbourg]] and the [[Sequence of Saint Eulalia|Canticle of Saint Eulalia]], both written in France. As the Carolingian Reforms spread to other Romance-speaking areas, local scholars devised orthographies for their own varieties of Romance as well.<ref>Wright (1982), pp. 122\u201332, 143\u20134</ref>\n\n== Notes ==\n{{notelist-lg}}\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n== Bibliography ==\n\n* {{Cite journal|last=|first=|last2=|date=2014-11-14|editor-last=Buchi|editor-first=\u00c9va|editor2-last=Schweickard|editor2-first=Wolfgang|editor3-last=Gouvert|editor3-first=Joannes|editor4-last=Kramer|title=Dictionnaire \u00c9tymologique Roman (D\u00c9Rom)|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1515/9783110313482|journal=Beihefte zur Zeitschrift f\u00fcr romanische Philologie|volume=|pages=295|doi=10.1515/9783110313482|via=}}\n* {{Cite book|last=|first=|url=http://worldcat.org/oclc/963581913|title=Dictionnaire \u00c9tymologique Roman (D\u00c9Rom) 2|date=2016|publisher=De Gruyter|year=2016|isbn=3-11-045361-4|editor-last=Buchi|editor-first=\u00c9va|location=|pages=|oclc=963581913|editor-last2=Gouvert|editor-first2=Xavier}}\n* {{Cite book|last=Loporcaro|first=Michele|url=http://worldcat.org/oclc/1107082342|title=Vowel Length From Latin to Romance|date=2015|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=|isbn=978-0-19-965655-4|location=|pages=25-30|oclc=1107082342}}\n* {{Cite journal|last=Dworkin|first=Steven N.|date=2016-01-01|title=Do Romanists need to reconstruct Proto-Romance?|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1515/zrp-2016-0001|journal=Zeitschrift f\u00fcr romanische Philologie|volume=132|issue=1|pages=2|doi=10.1515/zrp-2016-0001|issn=1865-9063|via=}}\n* {{Cite book|last=Ferguson|first=Thaddeus|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1515/9783110806960|title=A History of the Romance Vowel Systems through Paradigmatic Reconstruction|date=1976-01-31|publisher=De Gruyter|year=|isbn=978-3-11-080696-0|location=Berlin, Boston|pages=78}}\n* {{Cite book|last=Wilkinson, Hugh E.|first=|url=http://worldcat.org/oclc/1055897845|title=Notes on the development of -KJ-, -TJ- in Spanish and Portuguese|date=1926|publisher=Aoyama Gakuin University|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=11-14|oclc=1055897845}}\n* {{Citation|last=Zampaulo|first=Andr\u00e9|title=Palatal Sound Change in the Romance languages|date=2019-08-22|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/oso/9780198807384.003.0006|work=Palatal Sound Change in the Romance Languages|volume=|pages=150\u2013199|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-880738-4|access-date=2020-04-01}}\n* {{Cite journal|last=De Dardel|first=R.|last2=Gaeng|first2=P.

For instance in ninth-century Spain \u27e8saeculum\u27e9 was simply the correct way to spell [sjeglo], meaning 'century'. The writer would not have actually said [s\u025bkulum] any more than a modern English speaker would pronounce \u27e8knight\u27e9 as *[kn\u026axt].<ref>Wright (1982), pp. 44\u201350</ref> \n\n[[Ecclesiastical Latin]], in its spoken form, was created later during the [[Carolingian Renaissance]]. The British scholar [[Alcuin]], tasked by [[Charlemagne]] with improving the standards of Latin writing in France, prescribed a pronunciation based on a fairly literal interpretation of Latin spelling. A word such as <viridiarium> 'orchard' now had to be read aloud precisely as it was spelled rather than as [[Old French]] ''vergier.''<ref>Wright (1982), pp. 104\u20137</ref>\n\nThis had the effect of rendering [[Sermon|sermons]] competely unintelligible to the general public, which prompted officials a few years later at the [[Council of Tours]] to order sermons to be rendered ''in rusticam romanam linguam'', 'in plain roman speech'.<ref>Wright (1982), pp. 118-20</ref> Another issue was that now two types of speech, Romance and Church Latin, had to coexist within one writing system. Within the same century the first attempts were made to devise an orthography specifically for Romance, as can be seen in the [[Oaths of Strasbourg]] and the [[Sequence of Saint Eulalia|Canticle of Saint Eulalia]], both written in France. As the Carolingian Reforms spread to other Romance-speaking areas, local scholars devised orthographies for their own varieties of Romance as well.<ref>Wright (1982), pp. 122\u201332, 143\u20134</ref>\n\n== Notes ==\n{{notelist-lg}}\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n== Bibliography ==\n\n* {{Cite journal|last=|first=|last2=|date=2014-11-14|editor-last=Buchi|editor-first=\u00c9va|editor2-last=Schweickard|editor2-first=Wolfgang|editor3-last=Gouvert|editor3-first=Joannes|editor4-last=Kramer|title=Dictionnaire \u00c9tymologique Roman (D\u00c9Rom)|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1515/9783110313482|journal=Beihefte zur Zeitschrift f\u00fcr romanische Philologie|volume=|pages=295|doi=10.1515/9783110313482|via=}}\n* {{Cite book|last=|first=|url=http://worldcat.org/oclc/963581913|title=Dictionnaire \u00c9tymologique Roman (D\u00c9Rom) 2|date=2016|publisher=De Gruyter|year=2016|isbn=3-11-045361-4|editor-last=Buchi|editor-first=\u00c9va|location=|pages=|oclc=963581913|editor-last2=Gouvert|editor-first2=Xavier}}\n* {{Cite book|last=Loporcaro|first=Michele|url=http://worldcat.org/oclc/1107082342|title=Vowel Length From Latin to Romance|date=2015|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=|isbn=978-0-19-965655-4|location=|pages=25-30|oclc=1107082342}}\n* {{Cite journal|last=Dworkin|first=Steven N.|date=2016-01-01|title=Do Romanists need to reconstruct Proto-Romance?|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1515/zrp-2016-0001|journal=Zeitschrift f\u00fcr romanische Philologie|volume=132|issue=1|pages=2|doi=10.1515/zrp-2016-0001|issn=1865-9063|via=}}\n* {{Cite book|last=Ferguson|first=Thaddeus|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1515/9783110806960|title=A History of the Romance Vowel Systems through Paradigmatic Reconstruction|date=1976-01-31|publisher=De Gruyter|year=|isbn=978-3-11-080696-0|location=Berlin, Boston|pages=78}}\n* {{Cite book|last=Wilkinson, Hugh E.|first=|url=http://worldcat.org/oclc/1055897845|title=Notes on the development of -KJ-, -TJ- in Spanish and Portuguese|date=1926|publisher=Aoyama Gakuin University|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=11-14|oclc=1055897845}}\n* {{Citation|last=Zampaulo|first=Andr\u00e9|title=Palatal Sound Change in the Romance languages|date=2019-08-22|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/oso/9780198807384.003.0006|work=Palatal Sound Change in the Romance Languages|volume=|pages=150\u2013199|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-880738-4|access-date=2020-04-01}}\n* {{Cite journal|last=De Dardel|first=R.|last2=Gaeng|first2=P.

Additionally, the same qualification was required in order to exercise public offices, such as [[Provost of the merchants of Paris|provost of the merchants]], [[alderman]] or [[consul]]. To be a [[Bourgeoisie|bourgeois]] of Paris, according to Article 173 of the [[Custom of Paris in New France|Custom of Paris]], one had to have held [[Domicile (law)|domicile]] in Paris as a [[Leasehold estate|tenant]] or as [[Ownership|owner]] for at least a year and a day. <ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|last=Division|first=Library of Congress European Law division|url=https://books.google.co.il/books?id=ln8tTxwXiQoC&redir_esc=y|title=The Coutumes of France in the Library of Congress: An Annotated Bibliography - Article 173|last2=|first2=|last3=|first3=|date=|publisher=The Lawbook Exchange, Ltd.|year=|isbn=978-1-58477-627-7|location=|pages=|language=fr}}</ref>\n\nThe bourgeois of Paris had privileges as well as duties: they were free from having to pay the [[taille]], however they were required to pay the city [[taxes]], they had to contribute to public [[Charity (practice)|charity]], they had to arm themselves at their own expense, and needed to join the urban [[militia]]. <ref name=\":0\" /> Unlike the aristocracy, the genealogies of the bourgeois families of Paris are difficult to track down. The names of original families have been diluted and mixed to similar, more common names. {{Original research inline|date=April 2020}}\n\n== Definition ==\n\nAccording to article 173 (previously 129) of the [[Custom of Paris in New France|Custom of Paris]], the \"right of the bourgeoisie\" is acquired in Paris by any person \"living and residing there for a year and a day,\" that is to say, having a personal home and staying there continuously with family, and not making temporary stays for business. This was to be proven by a receipt of rent or personal capitation, and not by renting a room or staying in a furnished hotel. Unlike the bourgeois or citizens of other free cities, Parisians did not need ''[[Letters of Bourgeoisie]]'' to prove their status. <ref name=\":0\" />\n\nIn other words, anyone who owned a home in Paris intra-muros as [[Ownership|owner]] or [[Leasehold estate|tenant]], and who resided there for over a year, was a bourgeois of Paris. There were no other conditions such as heritage, [[oath]] or other, unlike in [[Bourgeois of Brussels|Brussels]] at the same period. {{Citation needed|date=April 2020}}\n\n== Duties and privileges of the bourgeois of Paris ==\n\nThese privileges were numerous, diverse, varying greatly from decade to decade. The list published in 1884 in ''[[L'Interm\u00e9diaire des chercheurs et curieux]] (''The Intermediate of the Researchers and Curious) give a glimpse on the variety of these privileges. Laurence Croq, who has dedicated a thesis to the study of the notion of the bourgeois of Paris at the 18th century, explains that this status had a [[wikt:polymorphous|polymorphous]] characteristic.<ref>Laurence Croq, ''Les \u00ab Bourgeois de Paris \u00bb au <abbr>xviii<sup>e</sup></abbr> si\u00e8cle.

Holders of registered occupations are considered to be bourgeois.\n\nDuring the 13th century, bourgeois dynasties were built: Sarrazins, Barbette, Bourdon (see rue des Bourdonnais), Pisdoe or Pizdoue, etc.\n\nThe capacity of bourgeois, that is to say of citizen of a city having political rights in opposition to the simple inhabitants, forms the base of the urban organization of cities.

Additionally, the same qualification was required in order to exercise public offices, such as [[Provost of the merchants of Paris|provost of the merchants]], [[alderman]] or [[consul]]. To be a [[Bourgeoisie|bourgeois]] of Paris, according to Article 173 of the [[Custom of Paris in New France|Custom of Paris]], one had to have held [[Domicile (law)|domicile]] in Paris as a [[Leasehold estate|tenant]] or as [[Ownership|owner]] for at least a year and a day. <ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|last=Division|first=Library of Congress European Law division|url=https://books.google.co.il/books?id=ln8tTxwXiQoC&redir_esc=y|title=The Coutumes of France in the Library of Congress: An Annotated Bibliography - Article 173|last2=|first2=|last3=|first3=|date=|publisher=The Lawbook Exchange, Ltd.|year=|isbn=978-1-58477-627-7|location=|pages=|language=fr}}</ref>\n\nThe bourgeois of Paris had privileges as well as duties: they were free from having to pay the [[taille]], however they were required to pay the city [[taxes]], they had to contribute to public [[Charity (practice)|charity]], they had to arm themselves at their own expense, and needed to join the urban [[militia]]. <ref name=\":0\" /> Unlike the aristocracy, the genealogies of the bourgeois families of Paris are difficult to track down. The names of original families have been diluted and mixed to similar, more common names. {{Original research inline|date=April 2020}}\n\n== Definition ==\n\nAccording to article 173 (previously 129) of the [[Custom of Paris in New France|Custom of Paris]], the \"right of the bourgeoisie\" is acquired in Paris by any person \"living and residing there for a year and a day,\" that is to say, having a personal home and staying there continuously with family, and not making temporary stays for business. This was to be proven by a receipt of rent or personal capitation, and not by renting a room or staying in a furnished hotel. Unlike the bourgeois or citizens of other free cities, Parisians did not need ''[[Letters of Bourgeoisie]]'' to prove their status. <ref name=\":0\" />\n\nIn other words, anyone who owned a home in Paris intra-muros as [[Ownership|owner]] or [[Leasehold estate|tenant]], and who resided there for over a year, was a bourgeois of Paris. There were no other conditions such as heritage, [[oath]] or other, unlike in [[Bourgeois of Brussels|Brussels]] at the same period. {{Citation needed|date=April 2020}}\n\n== Duties and privileges of the bourgeois of Paris ==\n\nThese privileges were numerous, diverse, verying greatly from decade to decade. The list published in 1884 in ''[[L'Interm\u00e9diaire des chercheurs et curieux]] (''The Intermediate of the Researchers and Curious) give a glimpse on the variety of these privileges. Laurence Croq, who has dedicated a thesis to the study of the notion of the bourgeois of Paris at the 18th century, explains that this status had a [[wikt:polymorphous|polymorphous]] characteristic.<ref>Laurence Croq, ''Les \u00ab Bourgeois de Paris \u00bb au <abbr>xviii<sup>e</sup></abbr> si\u00e8cle.

Holders of registered occupations are considered to be bourgeois.\n\nDuring the 13th century, bourgeois dynasties were built: Sarrazins, Barbette, Bourdon (see rue des Bourdonnais), Pisdoe or Pizdoue, etc.\n\nThe capacity of bourgeois, that is to say of citizen of a city having political rights in opposition to the simple inhabitants, forms the base of the urban organization of cities.
