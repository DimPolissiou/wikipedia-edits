Although some encodings allocate this 7-bit character set in the upper part of the 8-bit character set, it should not be confused with [[ASMO 708]]. In the character sets that allocate ASMO 449 (or some variant of it) in the upper part of the 8-bit character set, the existence of apparently repeated characters is due to the fact that the characters in the lower part are for left-to-right script while the characters in the upper part are for right-to-left script.

other character sets==\nASMO 449 is a 7-bit character set.

In the character sets that allocate ASMO 449 (or some variant of it) in the upper part of the 8-bit character set, the existence of apparently repeated characters is due to the fact that the characters in the lower part are for left-to-right script while the characters in the upper part are for right-to-left script. When ASMO 449 (or some variant of it) is allocated to the  upper part of the 8-bit character set, it has [[Eastern Arabic numerals|Arabic digits]].<!-- Always? -->\n*[[Al-Arabi (character set)|Al-Arabi]]<ref name=\"Printronix\" /> adds the characters NBS in 0xF5, \"-\" in 0xF6, \"\u00f7\" in 0xF7, \"\u00d7\" in 0xF8, \"\u00ab\" in 0xF9 and \"\u00bb\" in 0xFA, and replaces \"\u0640\" with \"`\"; this character set is sometimes referred as Code Page 768 (not an official IBM code page).\n*DEC's [[DEC/8/ASMO]]<ref name=\"Printronix\" /> has the same repertoire and the same sequence of Arabic characters but dislocates them.\n*HP's [[Arabic-8]]<ref name=\"Printronix\" /> is also based on ASMO 449;\n*Apple's [[MacArabic encoding|MacArabic]] adds French, German and Spanish characters in their typical code points from [[Mac OS Roman|MacRoman]], and adds letters for Persian and Urdu.\n*Apple's [[MacFarsi encoding|MacFarsi]] replaces the Arabic digits from MacArabic with Persian ones.\n*The [[MARC Code Table 7|Code Table 7]]<ref>[http://www.itsmarc.com/crs/mergedprojects/marcspec/marcspec/code_table_7_basic_and_extended_arabic.htm Code Table 7]</ref> from [[MARC-8]] allocates ASMO 449 in the lower part of the 8-bit character set and allocates the upper part with the Arabic Extension ([[ISO 11822]] / IR 224).\n*Microsoft's [[Code page 709]],<ref name=\"Printronix\" /> for MS-DOS, adds French and German characters in their typical code points from [[code page 437]].\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n* [http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=147704&package_id=193433 giconv] a graphical interface to a patched [[libiconv]] version that recodes ASMO449+ to [[UTF-8]]\n\n{{ISO standards}}\n{{character encoding}}\n\n[[Category:Character sets]]\n[[Category:ISO standards]]\n", "name_user": "Drmccreedy", "label": "safe", "comment": "Move legend to end of table.

''Phoenix'' was able to approach and engage ''Didon'' before the French realised that she was a larger frigate than they had anticipated.<ref name=\"James164\"/>  At 8am ''Didon'' hoisted French colours and an hour later the fighting commenced. ''Didon'' opened fire upon ''Phoenix'' still coming down but ''Phoenix'' made no return and Captain Baker intended to pass and engage to [[leeward]] of the French ship. In the meantime ''Didon'' [[Raking fire|raked]] the British frigate while Baker therefore determined to close with his adversary.<ref name=\"James164\"/> ''Phoenix'' ranged up alongside ''Didon'' and engaged within pistol shot but was to far [[windward]] and having too much way upon her soon drew ahead of the French ship.<ref name=\"NMSB\"/> ''Didon'' took advantage of this by luffing across the stern of ''Phoenix'' and poured in a raking [[broadside]].<ref name=\"LG2\"/> She then bore up and again raked ''Phoenix'' and was about to do this again but Baker counteracted the movement.

[https://www.wired.com/2013/10/the-rise-of-supervolcano/]</ref>\n\nIts origins lie in an early 20th-century scientific debate about the geological history and features of the [[Three Sisters (Oregon)|Three Sisters]] volcanic region of [[Oregon]] in the United States. In 1925, Edwin T. Hodge suggested that a very large volcano, which he named [[Mount Multnomah]], had existed in that region.<ref group=note>Subsequent research proved that each peak of the Three Sisters was formed independently, and that Mount Multnomah never existed.</ref> He believed that several [[Summit (topography)|peaks]] in the Three Sisters area were the remnants of Mount Multnomah after it had been largely destroyed by violent volcanic explosions, similar to [[Mount Mazama]].<ref>Harris, Stephen (1988) ''Fire Mountains of the West: The Cascade and Mono Lake Volcanoes'', Missoula, Mountain Press.</ref> In 1948, the possible existence of Mount Multnomah was ignored by volcanologist [[Howel Williams]] in his book ''The Ancient Volcanoes of Oregon''. This book was reviewed in 1949 by another volcanologist, F. M. Byers Jr.<ref>Byers Jr., F. M.

When created, these regions often occupy several thousand square kilometres and have volumes on the order of millions of cubic kilometers. In most cases, the lavas are normally laid down over several million years. They release large amounts of gases.\n\nThe [[R\u00e9union hotspot]] produced the Deccan Traps about 66&nbsp;million years ago, coincident with the [[Cretaceous\u2013Paleogene extinction event]]. The scientific consensus is that a [[meteor]] impact was the cause of the extinction event, but the volcanic activity may have caused environmental stresses on extant species up to the [[Cretaceous\u2013Paleogene boundary]].<ref>{{Cite journal|url = |title = Deccan volcanism, the Chicxulub impact, and the end-Cretaceous mass extinction: Coincidence?

Many volcanologists consider [[Iceland]] to be a large igneous province that is currently being formed. The last major outpouring occurred in 1783\u201384 from the [[Laki fissure]], which is approximately {{convert|40|km|mi|abbr=on}} long. An estimated {{convert|14|km3|cumi|abbr=on}} of basaltic lava was poured out during the eruption (VEI 4).\n\nThe [[Ontong Java Plateau]] has an area of about {{convert|2000000|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}}, and the province was at least 50% larger before the [[Manihiki Plateau|Manihiki]] and [[Hikurangi Plateau]]s broke away.\n\n== Massive explosive eruptions ==\n{{see also|List of largest volcanic eruptions}}\n\nVolcanic eruptions are classified using the [[Volcanic Explosivity Index]], or VEI. It is a [[logarithmic scale]], which means that an increase of one in VEI number is equivalent to a tenfold increase in volume of erupted material. VEI 7 or VEI 8 eruptions are so powerful that they often form circular calderas rather than [[volcanic cone|cones]] because the downward withdrawal of magma causes the overlying rock mass to collapse into the empty [[magma chamber]] beneath it.\n\n=== Known super eruptions ===\nBased on incomplete statistics, at least 60 VEI 8 eruptions have been identified.<ref name=\":0\"/><ref>{{Cite journal|url = |title = The size and frequency of the largest explosive eruptions on Earth|last = BG|first = Mason|date = 2004|journal = Bull Volcanol|volume = 66|issue = 8|pages = 735\u2013748|doi = 10.1007/s00445-004-0355-9|pmid = |accessdate = |bibcode = 2004BVol...66..735M}}</ref>\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable mw-collapsible\" style=\"whitespace:no-wrap\"\n|+ [[Volcanic Explosivity Index|VEI]] 8 eruptions have happened in the following locations.\n!Name\n!Zone\n!Location\n!class=unsortable|Notes\n!Years ago (approx.)\n!Ejecta bulk volume (approx.)\n!class=unsortable|Reference\n|-\n| '''[[Flat Landing Brook Formation]]'''\n| Tetagouche-Exploits back-arc basin  \n| [[New Brunswick]], [[Canada]]\n| May be a single supereruption of at least 12,000&nbsp;km<sup>3</sup> (VEI 9) or multiple 2,000+&nbsp;km<sup>3</sup> eruptions\n| style=\"text-align:right;\"| 466,000,000\n| style=\"text-align:right;\"| {{sort|7,000|2,000\u201312,000&nbsp;km<sup>3</sup>}}\n| <ref>http://dnr-mrn.gnb.ca/Lexicon/Lexicon/Lexicon_View.aspx?UnitId=137</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.mineralogicalassociation.ca/doc/StJohns2012_GAC-MAC_Abstracts.pdf |title=Archived copy |access-date=12 September 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191212184601/http://www.mineralogicalassociation.ca/doc/StJohns2012_GAC-MAC_Abstracts.pdf |archive-date=12 December 2019 |url-status=dead }}</ref> \n|-\n| '''Wah Wah Springs'''\n| Indian Peak\u2013Caliente Caldera Complex\n| [[Utah]], [[United States]]\n| The largest of the Indian Peak-Caliente Caldera Complex eruptions, preserved as the Wah Wah Springs Tuff; includes lava flows more than {{Convert|13000|ft|m|order=flip}} thick\n| style=\"text-align:right;\"| 30,600,000\n| style=\"text-align:right;\"| {{sort|5,700|5,500\u20135,900&nbsp;km<sup>3</sup>}}\n|<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Tingey|first=David G.|last2=Hart|first2=Garret L.|last3=Gromme|first3=Sherman|last4=Deino|first4=Alan L.|last5=Christiansen|first5=Eric H.|last6=Best|first6=Myron G.|date=2013-08-01|title=The 36\u201318 Ma Indian Peak\u2013Caliente ignimbrite field and calderas, southeastern Great Basin, USA: Multicyclic super-eruptions|journal=Geosphere|language=en|volume=9|issue=4|pages=864\u2013950|doi=10.1130/GES00902.1|bibcode=2013Geosp...9..864B|doi-access=free}}</ref><ref name=\"geology.com\">https://geology.com/stories/13/volcanic-explosivity-index/</ref>\n|-\n| '''[[La Garita Caldera]]'''\n| [[San Juan volcanic field]]\n| [[Colorado]], [[United States]]\n| [[Fish Canyon Tuff|Fish Canyon eruption]]\n| style=\"text-align:right;\"| 27,800,000\n| style=\"text-align:right;\"| 5,000&nbsp;km<sup>3</sup>\n| <ref>{{cite web|title=La Garita Caldera |url=http://staff.aist.go.jp/s-takarada/CEV/newsletter/lagarita.html |last=Ort |first=Michael |publisher=[[Northern Arizona University]] |date=22 September 1997 |access-date=5 August 2010 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110519165154/http://staff.aist.go.jp/s-takarada/CEV/newsletter/lagarita.html |archive-date=19 May 2011 |df= }}</ref><ref name=\"Lipman\">{{cite journal |last=Lipman |first=Peter W. |title=Geologic Map of the Central San Juan Caldera Cluster, Southwestern Colorado |series=USGS Investigations Series I-2799 |url=http://pubs.usgs.gov/imap/i2799/ |date=2007-11-02 |access-date=6 August 2010 |journal= |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100831221119/http://pubs.usgs.gov/imap/i2799/ |archive-date=31 August 2010 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n|-\n| '''[[Lake Toba]]'''\n| [[Lake Toba]], [[North Sumatra]]\n| [[Sumatra]], [[Indonesia]]\n| Produced 2200\u20134400 million tons of [[H2SO4|H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>]]\n| style=\"text-align:right;\"| 74,000\n| style=\"text-align:right;\"|  2,800&nbsp;km<sup>3</sup>\n| <ref name=sci>{{cite journal|journal= Science|doi=10.1126/science.1141564 |year=2007|title= Middle Paleolithic Assemblages from the Indian Subcontinent Before and After the Toba Super-Eruption|last1= Petraglia|first1= M.|last2= Korisettar|first2= R.|last3= Boivin|first3= N.|last4= Clarkson|first4= C.|last5= Ditchfield|first5= P.|last6= Jones|first6= S.|last7= Koshy|first7= J.|last8= Lahr|first8= M.

[https://www.wired.com/2013/10/the-rise-of-supervolcano/]</ref>\n\nIts origins lie in an early 20th-century scientific debate about the geological history and features of the [[Three Sisters (Oregon)|Three Sisters]] volcanic region of [[Oregon]] in the United States. In 1925, Edwin T. Hodge suggested that a very large volcano, which he named [[Mount Multnomah]], had existed in that region.<ref group=note>Subsequent research proved that each peak of the Three Sisters was formed independently, and that Mount Multnomah never existed.</ref> He believed that several [[Summit (topography)|peaks]] in the Three Sisters area were the remnants of Mount Multnomah after it had been largely destroyed by violent volcanic explosions, similar to [[Mount Mazama]].<ref>Harris, Stephen (1988) ''Fire Mountains of the West: The Cascade and Mono Lake Volcanoes'', Missoula, Mountain Press.</ref> In 1948, the possible existence of Mount Multnomah was ignored by volcanologist [[Howel Williams]] in his book ''The Ancient Volcanoes of Oregon''.

When created, these regions often occupy several thousand square kilometres and have volumes on the order of millions of cubic kilometers. In most cases, the lavas are normally laid down over several million years. They release large amounts of gases.\n\nThe [[R\u00e9union hotspot]] produced the Deccan Traps about 66&nbsp;million years ago, coincident with the [[Cretaceous\u2013Paleogene extinction event]]. The scientific consensus is that a [[meteor]] impact was the cause of the extinction event, but the volcanic activity may have caused environmental stresses on extant species up to the [[Cretaceous\u2013Paleogene boundary]].<ref>{{Cite journal|url = |title = Deccan volcanism, the Chicxulub impact, and the end-Cretaceous mass extinction: Coincidence?

Many volcanologists consider [[Iceland]] to be a large igneous province that is currently being formed. The last major outpouring occurred in 1783\u201384 from the [[Laki fissure]], which is approximately {{convert|40|km|mi|abbr=on}} long. An estimated {{convert|14|km3|cumi|abbr=on}} of basaltic lava was poured out during the eruption (VEI 4).\n\nThe [[Ontong Java Plateau]] has an area of about {{convert|2000000|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}}, and the province was at least 50% larger before the [[Manihiki Plateau|Manihiki]] and [[Hikurangi Plateau]]s broke away.\n\n== Massive explosive eruptions ==\n{{see also|List of largest volcanic eruptions}}\n\nVolcanic eruptions are classified using the [[Volcanic Explosivity Index]], or VEI. It is a [[logarithmic scale]], which means that an increase of one in VEI number is equivalent to a tenfold increase in volume of erupted material. VEI 7 or VEI 8 eruptions are so powerful that they often form circular calderas rather than [[volcanic cone|cones]] because the downward withdrawal of magma causes the overlying rock mass to collapse into the empty [[magma chamber]] beneath it.\n\n=== Known super eruptions ===\nBased on incomplete statistics, at least 60 VEI 8 eruptions have been identified.<ref name=\":0\"/><ref>{{Cite journal|url = |title = The size and frequency of the largest explosive eruptions on Earth|last = BG|first = Mason|date = 2004|journal = Bull Volcanol|volume = 66|issue = 8|pages = 735\u2013748|doi = 10.1007/s00445-004-0355-9|pmid = |accessdate = |bibcode = 2004BVol...66..735M}}</ref>\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable mw-collapsible\" style=\"whitespace:no-wrap\"\n|+ [[Volcanic Explosivity Index|VEI]] 8 eruptions have happened in the following locations.\n!Name\n!Zone\n!Location\n!class=unsortable|Notes\n!Years ago (approx.)\n!Ejecta bulk volume (approx.)\n!class=unsortable|Reference\n|-\n| '''[[Flat Landing Brook Formation]]'''\n| Tetagouche-Exploits back-arc basin  \n| [[New Brunswick]], [[Canada]]\n| May be a single supereruption of at least 12,000&nbsp;km<sup>3</sup> (VEI 9) or multiple 2,000+&nbsp;km<sup>3</sup> eruptions\n| style=\"text-align:right;\"| 466,000,000\n| style=\"text-align:right;\"| {{sort|7,000|2,000\u201312,000&nbsp;km<sup>3</sup>}}\n| <ref>http://dnr-mrn.gnb.ca/Lexicon/Lexicon/Lexicon_View.aspx?UnitId=137</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.mineralogicalassociation.ca/doc/StJohns2012_GAC-MAC_Abstracts.pdf |title=Archived copy |access-date=12 September 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191212184601/http://www.mineralogicalassociation.ca/doc/StJohns2012_GAC-MAC_Abstracts.pdf |archive-date=12 December 2019 |url-status=dead }}</ref> \n|-\n| '''Wah Wah Springs'''\n| Indian Peak\u2013Caliente Caldera Complex\n| [[Utah]], [[United States]]\n| The largest of the Indian Peak-Caliente Caldera Complex eruptions, preserved as the Wah Wah Springs Tuff; includes lava flows more than {{Convert|13000|ft|m|order=flip}} thick\n| style=\"text-align:right;\"| 30,600,000\n| style=\"text-align:right;\"| {{sort|5,700|5,500\u20135,900&nbsp;km<sup>3</sup>}}\n|<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Tingey|first=David G.|last2=Hart|first2=Garret L.|last3=Gromme|first3=Sherman|last4=Deino|first4=Alan L.|last5=Christiansen|first5=Eric H.|last6=Best|first6=Myron G.|date=2013-08-01|title=The 36\u201318 Ma Indian Peak\u2013Caliente ignimbrite field and calderas, southeastern Great Basin, USA: Multicyclic super-eruptions|journal=Geosphere|language=en|volume=9|issue=4|pages=864\u2013950|doi=10.1130/GES00902.1|bibcode=2013Geosp...9..864B|doi-access=free}}</ref><ref name=\"geology.com\">https://geology.com/stories/13/volcanic-explosivity-index/</ref>\n|-\n| '''[[La Garita Caldera]]'''\n| [[San Juan volcanic field]]\n| [[Colorado]], [[United States]]\n| [[Fish Canyon Tuff|Fish Canyon eruption]]\n| style=\"text-align:right;\"| 27,800,000\n| style=\"text-align:right;\"| 5,000&nbsp;km<sup>3</sup>\n| <ref>{{cite web|title=La Garita Caldera |url=http://staff.aist.go.jp/s-takarada/CEV/newsletter/lagarita.html |last=Ort |first=Michael |publisher=[[Northern Arizona University]] |date=22 September 1997 |access-date=5 August 2010 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110519165154/http://staff.aist.go.jp/s-takarada/CEV/newsletter/lagarita.html |archive-date=19 May 2011 |df= }}</ref><ref name=\"Lipman\">{{cite journal |last=Lipman |first=Peter W. |title=Geologic Map of the Central San Juan Caldera Cluster, Southwestern Colorado |series=USGS Investigations Series I-2799 |url=http://pubs.usgs.gov/imap/i2799/ |date=2007-11-02 |access-date=6 August 2010 |journal= |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100831221119/http://pubs.usgs.gov/imap/i2799/ |archive-date=31 August 2010 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n|-\n| '''[[Lake Toba]]'''\n| [[Lake Toba]], [[North Sumatra]]\n| [[Sumatra]], [[Indonesia]]\n| Produced 2200\u20134400 million tons of [[H2SO4|H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>]]\n| style=\"text-align:right;\"| 74,000\n| style=\"text-align:right;\"|  2,800&nbsp;km<sup>3</sup>\n| <ref name=sci>{{cite journal|journal= Science|doi=10.1126/science.1141564 |year=2007|title= Middle Paleolithic Assemblages from the Indian Subcontinent Before and After the Toba Super-Eruption|last1= Petraglia|first1= M.|last2= Korisettar|first2= R.|last3= Boivin|first3= N.|last4= Clarkson|first4= C.|last5= Ditchfield|first5= P.|last6= Jones|first6= S.|last7= Koshy|first7= J.|last8= Lahr|first8= M.

For example, when an herbivore feeds on a single corn seedling leaf, the plant will emit volatiles from all its leaves, whether or not they too have been damaged. Locally induced defenses aid parasitoids in targeting their foraging behaviors to the exact location of the herbivore on the plant. Systemic defenses are less spatially specific and may serve to confuse the enemy once the source plant is located. A plant might employ both local and systemic responses simultaneously.<ref name=\"Price\" />\n\n== Morphological mechanisms of enemy attraction ==\n\n=== Domatia ===\n[[File:Guioa_acutifolia_leaflet_detail_Kewarra_4493.jpg|thumb|A hairless foveole domatium in the leaf underside of ''[[Guioa acutifolia]]'']] \n{{main|Domatium}}\n\nNatural enemies must survive long enough and respond quickly enough to plant volatiles in order to benefit the plant through predatory behavior. Certain plant structures, called [[domatia]], can selectively reinforce mutualisms with natural enemies and increase the fitness benefit they receive from that mutualism by ensuring the survival and proximity of natural enemies. Domatia provide a kind of housing or refuge for predators from both [[Abiotic stress|abiotic]] stressors, such as desiccation, and biotic stress, such as predation from higher-order predators. Therefore, they ensure not only better survival, but eliminate the time required for natural enemies to locate and travel to the damaged plant. For this reason, natural enemies that make use of domatia are often said to serve as \"bodyguards\" for the plant in or on which they live.

These can include the physical size, shape, density, maturity, colour, and texture of a given plant species. Specific plant features such as the hairiness or glossiness of vegetation can have mixed effects on different natural enemies. For example, [[Trichome|trichomes]] decrease hunting efficiency in many natural enemies, as trichomes tend to slow or prevent movement due to the physical obstacles they present or due to the adhesive secretions they produce. However, this is not the case for all natural enemies.

Trichomes can develop in a variety of forms including, hairs or as pocket-like structures called glandular trichomes. These glandular trichomes store species-specific secondary metabolites such as [[Terpenoid|terpenoids]] and [[Phenols|phenolics]] in a pocket like structure between the cell wall and the cuticle of the plant.

The extent of the influence largely depends on the evolutionary history shared between the two as well as on the pathogens' method of infection and survival duration outside of a host. Several studies have shown that different insect host plants contain various compounds which cause different levels of insect mortality when certain entomopathogens are simultaneously injected. In some cases, significant increases in mortality are recorded, up to 50-fold in some studies. However, other research reveals that certain plants influence entomopathogens in negative ways, reducing their efficacy.<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite journal|last=Cory, J.

For example, when an herbivore feeds on a single corn seedling leaf, the plant will emit volatiles from all its leaves, whether or not they too have been damaged. Locally induced defenses aid parasitoids in targeting their foraging behaviors to the exact location of the herbivore on the plant. Systemic defenses are less spatially specific and may serve to confuse the enemy once the source plant is located. A plant might employ both local and systemic responses simultaneously.<ref name=\"Price\" />\n\n== Morphological mechanisms of enemy attraction ==\n\n=== Domatia ===\n[[File:Guioa_acutifolia_leaflet_detail_Kewarra_4493.jpg|thumb|A hairless foveole domatium in the leaf underside of ''[[Guioa acutifolia]]'']] \n{{main|Domatium}}\n\nNatural enemies must survive long enough and respond quickly enough to plant volatiles in order to benefit the plant through predatory behavior. Certain plant structures, called [[domatia]], can selectively reinforce mutualisms with natural enemies and increase the fitness benefit they receive from that mutualism by ensuring the survival and proximity of natural enemies. Domatia provide a kind of housing or refuge for predators from both [[Abiotic stress|abiotic]] stressors, such as desiccation, and biotic stress, such as predation from higher-order predators. Therefore, they ensure not only better survival, but eliminate the time required for natural enemies to locate and travel to the damaged plant. For this reason, natural enemies that make use of domatia are often said to serve as \"bodyguards\" for the plant in or on which they live. Domatia may be as well-developed as acacia tree thorns, or as simple and incidental as a depression or crevice in a leaf stem, but they are distinguishable from [[galls]] and other similar structures in that they are not induced by the insect but formed constitutively by the plant.<ref name=\"Price\" />\n\n=== Nutritional rewards ===\n\nAs long as natural enemies have some potential to be [[omnivorous]], plants can provide food resources to encourage their retention and increase the impact they have on herbivore populations. This potential, however, can hinge on a number of insect traits. For example, [[hemipteran]] predators can use their piercing-sucking mouthparts to make use of leaves, stems, and fruits, but spiders with [[chelicerae]] cannot.<ref name=\"Price\" /> Still, insects widely considered to be 100% carnivorous have recently been observed to diverge from expected feeding behavior.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Rubinoff |first=D. |title=Web-Spinning Caterpillar Stalks Snails |journal=Science |date=22 July 2005 |volume=309 |issue=5734 |pages=575 |doi=10.1126/science.1110397 |pmid=16040699}}</ref>\nSome plants simply tolerate a low level of herbivory by natural enemies for the service they provide in ridding the plant of more serious herbivores. Others, however, have structures thought to serve no purpose other than attracting and provisioning natural enemies. These structures derived from a long history of [[coevolution]] between the first and third trophic levels. A good example is the [[extrafloral nectaries]] which many [[myrmecophytes]] and other [[angiosperms]] sport on leaves, bracts, stems, and fruits. Nutritionally, extrafloral nectaries are similar to floral nectaries, but differ as they do not encourage the visiting insect to come into contact with pollen at any point. Their existence is therefore not the product of a pollinator-plant mutualism, but rather a tritrophic, defensive interaction.<ref name=\"Price\" />\n\n== Human uses ==\n[[File:KarottenZwiebeln 266.JPG|right|thumb|[[Companion planting]] controls pests partly by favouring natural enemies.<ref name=Landis/>]]\n\nExploitation of tritrophic interactions has the capacity to directly benefit agricultural systems.

These can include the physical size, shape, density, maturity, colour, and texture of a given plant species. Specific plant features such as the hairiness or glossiness of vegetation can have mixed effects on different natural enemies. For example, [[Trichome|trichomes]] decrease hunting efficiency in many natural enemies, as trichomes tend to slow or prevent movement due to the physical obstacles they present or due to the adhesive secretions they produce. However, this is not the case for all natural enemies.

The extent of the influence largely depends on the evolutionary history shared between the two as well as on the pathogens' method of infection and survival duration outside of a host. Several studies have shown that different insect host plants contain various compounds which cause different levels of insect mortality when certain entomopathogens are simultaneously injected. In some cases, significant increases in mortality are recorded, up to 50-fold in some studies. However, other research reveals that certain plants influence entomopathogens in negative ways, reducing their efficacy.<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite journal|last=Cory, J.

For example, the mortality of pea aphids was higher in the group of aphids that were found on plants with fewer wax exudates compared to plants with more wax exudates. This reduced waxiness increased the transmission of ''Pandora neoaphidus'' [[Conidium|conidia]] from the plant to the aphids.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Duetting, P. S., Eigenbrode, S.

Plants can also influence pathogen efficacy indirectly, and this typically occurs either by increasing the susceptibility of the herbivore hosts or by changing their behavior. This influence can often take the form of altered growth rates, herbivore physiology, or feeding habits. This research illustrates the differential impact that various host plant species can have on entomopathogenic interactions.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\nIn one study, it was proved that [[Brassica|Brassicas]] can defend themselves by acting as a [[Vector (epidemiology)|vector]] for entomopathogens. It was shown that virus-infected aphids feeding on the plants introduced a virus into the phloem. The virus was passively transported in the phloem and was carried throughout the plant. This caused the aphids that were feeding in separate locations from the infected aphids to become infected as well. This finding presents the possibility of injecting crops with compatible entomopathogenic viruses to defend against susceptible insect pests.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Van Munster, M., Janssen, A., Clerivet, A., Van Den Heuvel, J.|first=|date=2005|title=Can Plants Use an Entomopathogenic Virus as a Defense Against Herbivores?|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs00442-004-1818-6|journal=Plant Animal Interactions|volume=143|pages=396-401|via=Springer Link}}</ref>\n\n==== Below-ground tritrophic interactions ====\nLess studied than above-ground interactions, but proving to be increasingly important, are the below-ground interactions that influence plant defense'''.'''<ref name=\":3\">{{Cite journal|last=Van Geem, M., Gols, R., Van Dam, N.

The colonization of plant roots with mycorhizae typically results in a mutualistic relationship between the plant and the fungus, inducing a number of changes in the plant. The analysis reviewed the mixed impact that colonization can have on herbivores; it highlighted that insects with different feeding methods were affected very differently, some positively and others negatively. The type of mycorhizae species involved also had a notable impact on the performance of the insects. One common species, ''Glomus intradices,'' had a negative effect on the feeding success of chewing herbivores, whereas other species studied had positive effects.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Koricheva, J., Gange, A.

It was found that only certain maize varieties produce this chemical; in the field, plants which released the chemical caused up to a five-fold increase in leaf beetle larvae parasitization over those that didn't produce the chemical. Incorporating these varieties or their genes into commercial maize production could significantly increase the efficacy of nematode treatments.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Rasmann, S., Kollner, T.

The underlying findings suggested that the plant-emitted chemicals acted as the primary source of attractant to the nematodes. It was suggested that the herbivores have evolved to be relatively undetectable to the nematodes, whereas the plants have evolved to release highly attractive chemical signals. It is clear that a high degree of specificity is involved; species that make up these tritrophic interactions have evolved closely with one another over a long period of time and as a result have very unique relationships.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Rasmann, S., Turlings, T.
