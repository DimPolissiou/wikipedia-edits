Dense vegetation can limit lines of sight and arcs of fire, but can also provide ample opportunity for camouflage and plenty of material with which to build fortifications.\n\nJungle terrain, often without good roads, can be inaccessible to vehicles and so makes [[Military logistics|logistical]] supply and transport difficult, which in turn places a premium on air mobility. The problems of transport make engineering resources important as they are needed to improve roads, build bridges and airfields, and improve water supplies.\n\nJungle environments can also be inherently unhealthy, with various tropical diseases that have to be prevented or treated by medical services. Likewise the terrain can make it difficult to deploy armoured forces, or any other kind of forces on any large scale. Successful jungle fighting emphasises effective small unit tactics and leadership.\n\n==History==\n\n===Pre-modern Jungle Warfare===\nThroughout world history, forests have played significant roles in many of the most historic battles. For example, in the [[Battle of the Teutoburg Forest]] between the Romans and the [[Germanic tribes]] in 9 CE, the Germans used the forest to ambush the Romans.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The battle that stopped Rome : Emperor Augustus, Arminius, and the slaughter of the legions in the Teutoburg Forest|last=S.|first=Wells, Peter|date=2003|publisher=W.W.

For example, the [[Northern Song Dynasty]] (960-1127) constructed and maintained an extensive defensive forest in present-day [[Hebei]].<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Chen|first=Yuan Julian|title=Frontier, Fortification, and Forestation: Defensive Woodland on the Song\u2013Liao Border in the Long Eleventh Century|date=July 2018|url=https://www.academia.edu/37471839|journal=Journal of Chinese History|language=en|volume=2|issue=2|pages=313\u2013334|doi=10.1017/jch.2018.7|issn=2059-1632|via=}}</ref>\n\n===Nicaragua Guerrilla===\n{{See also|United States occupation of Nicaragua|Augusto C\u00e9sar Sandino}}\n{{Expand section|date=December 2009}}\n\n===World War II===\n\n===Conventional jungle warfare===\n[[File:Australian 2-pdr anti-tank gun in action at Bakri on the Muar-Parit Sulong Road.jpg|thumb|left|Australian [[Ordnance QF 2-pounder|2-pounder]] anti-tank gunners firing on Japanese tanks at the Muar-Parit Sulong Road.]]\nAt the start of [[Pacific War]] in the [[Far East]], the Japanese Imperial Forces were able to advance on all fronts. In the [[Malayan Campaign]], time and again they infiltrated through the jungle to bypass static British positions based on road blocks so that they could cut the British supply line and attack their defences from all sides.\n\nIn early 1942, the fighting in [[British rule in Burma|Burma]] at the start of the [[Burma Campaign]] took on a similar aspect and resulted in one of the longest retreats in [[British military history]].{{sfn|Cowley|Parker|2001|p=511}} Most members of the [[British Indian Army]] left Burma with the belief that the Japanese were unstoppable in the jungle.\n\n[[File:The British Army in Burma 1944 SE198.jpg|thumb|British troops in Burma, 1944]]\nThe [[Chindits]] were a special force of 3,500 which in February 1942 launched a deep penetration raid, (code-named [[Operation Longcloth]]) into [[Japanese occupation of Burma|Japanese occupied Burma]]. They went in on foot using mules to carry supplies. The operation was not a military success, but was a propaganda boost for the Allies, because it showed that Allied forces could successfully move and fight in jungle terrain well away from roads. On the back of the propaganda success, [[Orde Wingate]], the eccentric commander of the Chindits, was given the resources to increase his command to divisional size and the [[United States Army Air Forces|USAAF]] supplied the [[1st Air Commando Group]] to support his operations. The availability of air transport revolutionized Wingate's operational choices. In February 1944 [[Operation Thursday]] was launched, and air transport support supplied 1st Air to allow the Chindits to set up air supplied bases deep behind enemy lines from which aggressive combat patrols could be sent out to interdict Japanese supply lines and disrupt rear echelon forces. This in turn forced the Japanese [[18th Division (Imperial Japanese Army)|18th Division]] to pull front-line troops from the battle against [[X Force]] which was advancing through Northern Burma to protect the men building the [[Ledo Road]]. When the Japanese closed on a base and got within artillery range the base could be abandoned and then set up in another remote location. The ability to sustain the bases that relied totally on air power in the coming decades would prove a template for many similar operations.\n[[File:Marine-raiders.jpg|thumb|210px|U.S. [[Marine Raiders]] gathered in front of a Japanese dugout on Cape Totkina on [[Bougainville campaign|Bougainville]], Solomon Islands.]]\nAfter the first Chindits expedition, thanks to the training the regular forces were receiving and the example of the Chindits and new divisional tactics, the regular units of the [[Fourteenth Army (United Kingdom)|Fourteenth Army]] started to get the measure of both the jungle and the enemy. When the Japanese launched their late 1943 Arakan offensive they infiltrated Allied lines to attack the [[7th Indian Infantry Division]] from the rear, overrunning the divisional HQ. Unlike previous occasions on which this had happened, the Allied forces stood firm against the attack and supplies were dropped to them by parachute. In the [[Battle of the Admin Box]] from 5 February to 23 February, the Japanese were unable to break through the heavily defended perimeter of the box. The Japanese switched their attack to the central front but again the British fell back into defensive box of [[Battle of Imphal|Imphal]], and the [[Battle of Kohima|Kohima redoubt]]. In falling back to the defensive positions around Imphal the leading British formations found their retreat cut by Japanese forces, but unlike previously, they took that attitude that if the Japanese were behind them then they were just as cut off as the British. The situation maps of the fighting along the roads leading to Imphal resembled a slice of marble cake as both sides used the jungle to outflank each other. Another major change by the British was that use of air support both as an offensive weapon to replace artillery, and as a logistical tool to transport men and equipment. For example, the [[5th Indian Infantry Division]] was airlifted straight from the now quieter Arakan front up to the central front and were in action within days of arriving. By the end of the campaigning season both Kohima and Imphal had been relieved and the Japanese were in full retreat.\n\nThe lessons learnt in Burma of how to fight in the jungle and how to use air transport to move troops around would lay the foundations of how to conduct large scale jungle campaigns in future wars.\n\n===Unconventional jungle warfare===\nImmediately after the fall of Malaya and Singapore in 1942, a few British officers, such as [[Freddie Spencer Chapman]], eluded capture and escaped into the central Malaysian jungle where they helped organize and train bands of lightly armed local [[Malaysian Chinese|ethnic Chinese]] communists into a capable guerrilla force against the Japanese occupiers. What began as desperate initiatives by several determined British officers probably inspired the subsequent formation of the above-mentioned early jungle-warfare forces.\nThe real pioneers who methodically developed it as a specialized branch of warfare - the unconventional, low-intensity, guerrilla-style type of warfare as it is understood today - were probably the British and Australians. [[V Force]] and [[Force 136]] were composed of small bodies of soldiers and irregulars, equipped with no more than small arms and explosives, but rigorously trained in guerrilla warfare-style tactics (particularly in close-quarter combat) who fought behind enemy lines. They were joined in Burma by American led Kachin guerrillas were armed and coordinated by the American liaison organisation, [[OSS Detachment 101]] that led,  armed, and coordinated them.\n\nAnother small force operating in the Far East was the Australian led [[Z Special Unit]] that carried out a total of 81 covert operations in the [[South West Pacific theatre]] some of which involved jungle warfare.\n\n===Cold War===\n\n====British experience in the Malayan Emergency====\n[[File:Sempreatentos...aoperigo!.jpg|thumb|right|[[Portuguese Army]] special ''[[ca\u00e7adores]]'' advancing in the African jungle in the early 1960s, during the Angola War of Independence.]] \nAfter the war, early skills in jungle warfare were further honed in the [[Malayan Emergency]], when in 1948 guerrilla fighters of the [[Malayan Communist Party]] (MCP) turned against the Commonwealth. In addition to jungle discipline, field craft, and survival skills, special tactics such as combat tracking (first using native trackers), close-quarter fighting (tactics were developed by troopers protected only with fencing masks stalking and shooting each other in the jungle training ground with air rifles), small team operations (which led to the typical four-man special operations teams) and tree jumping (parachuting into the jungle and through the rain forest canopy) were developed from Borneo's [[Iban people|Iban]] native to actively take the war to the Communist guerrillas instead of reacting to incidents initiated by them.\n\nOf greater importance was the integration of the tactical jungle warfare with the strategic \"[[winning hearts and minds]]\" psychological, economic and political warfare as a complete [[counter-insurgency]] package. The Malayan Emergency was declared over in 1960 as the surviving [[Communism|Communist]] [[guerrillas]] were driven to the jungle near the Thai border, where they remained until they gave up their armed struggle in 1989.\n\n[[Image:Singapore Army Combat Trackers in Brunei, early 1980s.jpg|thumb|left|Singapore Army Combat Trackers, a little known elite four-team jungle warfare unit, in Brunei during the early 1980s.]]\n\n====Cuban Revolution and Che Guevara====\n{{Main|Cuban Revolution}}\n\n====Brazilian military government guerrilla====\n{{Main|Brazilian military government}}\n\n====Portuguese Colonial War====\n{{Main|Portuguese Colonial War}}\nIn the 1960s and early 1970s, Portugal was engaged in jungle warfare operations in Africa, against the independentist guerrillas of [[Portuguese Angola|Angola]], [[Portuguese Guinea]] and [[Portuguese Mozambique|Mozambique]]. These operations were part of what is collectively known as the \"[[Portuguese Colonial War]]\". In fact, there were three different wars: the [[Angolan Independence War]], the [[Guinea-Bissau War of Independence]] and the [[Mozambican War of Independence]]. The situation was unique in that small armed forces &ndash; [[Portuguese Armed Forces|those of Portugal]] &ndash; were able to conduct three large scale counterinsurgency wars at the same time, each in a different [[theatre of operations]], each one separated by thousands of [[kilometer]]s from the others. For these operations, Portugal developed its own counterinsurgency and jungle warfare doctrines.<ref>Cann, Jonh P., ''Counterinsurgency in Africa: The Portuguese Way of War, 1961-1974'', Hailer Publishing, 2005.</ref>\n\n====Vietnam War====\nThe British experience in counter insurgency was passed onto the Americans during their involvement in the [[Vietnam War]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tamilnation.org/armed_conflict/thompson.htm|title=Web Page Under Construction|website=www.tamilnation.org}}</ref>  where the battlegrounds were, again, the jungle. Much of British strategic thinking on counter-insurgency tactics in a jungle environment was passed on through BRIAM (British Advisory Mission) to [[South Vietnam]] headed by Sir [[Robert Grainger Ker Thompson|Robert Thompson]], a former Chindit and the Permanent Secretary of Defense for Malaya during the Emergency).<ref>[https://www.jstor.org/stable/1953570?seq=1 Edward Reynolds Wright, Jr, Review of ''No Exit From Vietnam'' by Sir Robert Thomson (New York: David McKay Co., Inc., 1970), in ''The American Political Science Review'', Vol. 65, No. 4 (Dec., 1971) pp. 1232-1234.]</ref>\n\nThe Americans further refined jungle warfare by the creation of such dedicated counter-insurgency special operations troops as the Special Forces ([[United States Army Special Forces|Green Berets]]), [[United States Army Rangers|Rangers]], [[Long-range reconnaissance patrol|Long Range Reconnaissance Patrols]] (LRRP) and Combat Tracker Teams (CTT).\n\nDuring the decade of active US combat involvement in the Vietnam War (1962\u20131972), jungle warfare became closely associated with counter insurgency and special operations troops.\n\nHowever, although the American forces managed to have mastered jungle warfare at a tactical level in Vietnam, they were unable to install a successful strategic program in winning a jungle-based guerrilla war.<ref>[http://www.historynet.com/marine-alternative-to-search-and-destroy.htm Master Sergeant James Donovan, USMC (ret.), \"Marine Alternative to Search and Destroy,\" article, in ''Historynet.org'' and ''Leatherneck.com,'' 2004.]</ref><ref>[http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/library/report/1990/PFD.htm Major Frank D.

In the euphoria at the end of the [[Cold War]], many Western nations were quick to claim the peace dividend and reinvested resources to other priorities.\n\nJungle warfare was reduced in scope and priority in the regular training curriculum of most conventional Western armies.<ref>[http://davidabel6.blogspot.com/2005/07/closing-prized-jungle-warfare-base.html David Abel, \"Closing Prized Jungle Warfare Base,\" in ''The Christian Science Monitor,'' 3 June 1999.]</ref> During this time, the nature of major military operations in the Middle East and Central Asia saw the need to put an emphasis upon [[desert warfare]] and [[urban warfare]] training - in both the conventional and unconventional warfare models.\n\n====Conflicts in Colombia, Ecuador and Peru====\n{{Main|Colombian armed conflict (1964\u2013present)|Internal conflict in Peru|Cenepa War}}\n{{Expand section|date=December 2009}}\n\n====Marawi====\n{{see also|Battle of Marawi}}\n\n==Jungle units==\n{{Multiple image\n| align = \n| direction = vertical\n| width = 220\n| image1 = 110612-M-EV637-065.jpg\n| caption1 = US Marines and Malaysian soldiers conducted jungle operations training as part of CARAT 2011.\n| image2 = Guereiro de Selva (26673373226).jpg\n| caption2 = [[Brazilian Army]] Jungle Infantry.\n| image3 = JUNGLE WARFARE.jpg\n| caption3 = [[Indonesian Army]] [[List of Indonesian infantry battalions|Infantry]] soldiers during Jungle warfare exercise \n}}\nAt present the following armies have specialised jungle units:\n* {{ARG}}: the [[Argentine Army]] has two companies of ''[[Cazadores de Monte (Argentine Army)|Cazadores de Monte]]'' (Jungle Hunters).\n* {{BRA}}: the [[Brazilian Army]] has four Jungle Infantry Brigades: 1st, 16th, 17th and 23rd Jungle Infantry Brigades and others units, grouped in two divisions, and the Jungle Warfare Training Center (CIGS).

JOTC is operated by the 25th Infantry Division to reaffirm their position as the United States Jungle Division. They primarily train soldiers and leaders of the 25th Infantry Division, Special Operation Forces, and Foreign Partners.

Jungle warfare training is not new to this organization in Hawaii or the United States. During World War II the Jungle Warfare Training Center, also known as the Pacific Combat Training Center, was established in Hawaii to teach soldiers survival and fighting skills in tropical environments. Over 300,000 US Military personnel were trained in jungle fighting prior to deploying throughout the Pacific. Between 1956 and 1965, this same installation in Hawaii was home to the Jungle and Guerilla Warfare Training Center followed by the Recondo School from 1971 to 1979. The United States' Asia-Pacific Rebalance Strategy necessitated jungle warfare training for the US Military be increased in priority.

Dense vegetation can limit lines of sight and arcs of fire, but can also provide ample opportunity for camouflage and plenty of material with which to build fortifications.\n\nJungle terrain, often without good roads, can be inaccessible to vehicles and so makes [[Military logistics|logistical]] supply and transport difficult, which in turn places a premium on air mobility. The problems of transport make engineering resources important as they are needed to improve roads, build bridges and airfields, and improve water supplies.\n\nJungle environments can also be inherently unhealthy, with various tropical diseases that have to be prevented or treated by medical services. Likewise the terrain can make it difficult to deploy armoured forces, or any other kind of forces on any large scale. Successful jungle fighting emphasises effective small unit tactics and leadership.\n\n==History==\n\n===Pre-modern Jungle Warfare===\nThroughout world history, forests have played significant roles in many of the most historic battles. For example, in the [[Battle of the Teutoburg Forest]] between the Romans and the [[Germanic tribes]] in 9 CE, the Germans used the forest to ambush the Romans.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The battle that stopped Rome : Emperor Augustus, Arminius, and the slaughter of the legions in the Teutoburg Forest|last=S.|first=Wells, Peter|date=2003|publisher=W.W.

For example, the [[Northern Song Dynasty]] (960-1127) constructed and maintained an extensive defensive forest in present-day [[Hebei]].<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Chen|first=Yuan Julian|title=Frontier, Fortification, and Forestation: Defensive Woodland on the Song\u2013Liao Border in the Long Eleventh Century|date=July 2018|url=https://www.academia.edu/37471839|journal=Journal of Chinese History|language=en|volume=2|issue=2|pages=313\u2013334|doi=10.1017/jch.2018.7|issn=2059-1632|via=}}</ref>\n\n===Nicaragua Guerrilla===\n{{See also|United States occupation of Nicaragua|Augusto C\u00e9sar Sandino}}\n{{Expand section|date=December 2009}}\n\n===World War II===\n\n===Conventional jungle warfare===\n[[File:Australian 2-pdr anti-tank gun in action at Bakri on the Muar-Parit Sulong Road.jpg|thumb|left|Australian [[Ordnance QF 2-pounder|2-pounder]] anti-tank gunners firing on Japanese tanks at the Muar-Parit Sulong Road.]]\nAt the start of [[Pacific War]] in the [[Far East]], the Japanese Imperial Forces were able to advance on all fronts. In the [[Malayan Campaign]], time and again they infiltrated through the jungle to bypass static British positions based on road blocks so that they could cut the British supply line and attack their defences from all sides.\n\nIn early 1942, the fighting in [[British rule in Burma|Burma]] at the start of the [[Burma Campaign]] took on a similar aspect and resulted in one of the longest retreats in [[British military history]].{{sfn|Cowley|Parker|2001|p=511}} Most members of the [[British Indian Army]] left Burma with the belief that the Japanese were unstoppable in the jungle.\n\n[[File:The British Army in Burma 1944 SE198.jpg|thumb|British troops in Burma, 1944]]\nThe [[Chindits]] were a special force of 3,500 which in February 1942 launched a deep penetration raid, (code-named [[Operation Longcloth]]) into [[Japanese occupation of Burma|Japanese occupied Burma]]. They went in on foot using mules to carry supplies. The operation was not a military success, but was a propaganda boost for the Allies, because it showed that Allied forces could successfully move and fight in jungle terrain well away from roads. On the back of the propaganda success, [[Orde Wingate]], the eccentric commander of the Chindits, was given the resources to increase his command to divisional size and the [[United States Army Air Forces|USAAF]] supplied the [[1st Air Commando Group]] to support his operations. The availability of air transport revolutionized Wingate's operational choices. In February 1944 [[Operation Thursday]] was launched, and air transport support supplied 1st Air to allow the Chindits to set up air supplied bases deep behind enemy lines from which aggressive combat patrols could be sent out to interdict Japanese supply lines and disrupt rear echelon forces. This in turn forced the Japanese [[18th Division (Imperial Japanese Army)|18th Division]] to pull front-line troops from the battle against [[X Force]] which was advancing through Northern Burma to protect the men building the [[Ledo Road]]. When the Japanese closed on a base and got within artillery range the base could be abandoned and then set up in another remote location. The ability to sustain the bases that relied totally on air power in the coming decades would prove a template for many similar operations.\n[[File:Marine-raiders.jpg|thumb|210px|U.S. [[Marine Raiders]] gathered in front of a Japanese dugout on Cape Totkina on [[Bougainville campaign|Bougainville]], Solomon Islands.]]\nAfter the first Chindits expedition, thanks to the training the regular forces were receiving and the example of the Chindits and new divisional tactics, the regular units of the [[Fourteenth Army (United Kingdom)|Fourteenth Army]] started to get the measure of both the jungle and the enemy. When the Japanese launched their late 1943 Arakan offensive they infiltrated Allied lines to attack the [[7th Indian Infantry Division]] from the rear, overrunning the divisional HQ. Unlike previous occasions on which this had happened, the Allied forces stood firm against the attack and supplies were dropped to them by parachute. In the [[Battle of the Admin Box]] from 5 February to 23 February, the Japanese were unable to break through the heavily defended perimeter of the box. The Japanese switched their attack to the central front but again the British fell back into defensive box of [[Battle of Imphal|Imphal]], and the [[Battle of Kohima|Kohima redoubt]]. In falling back to the defensive positions around Imphal the leading British formations found their retreat cut by Japanese forces, but unlike previously, they took that attitude that if the Japanese were behind them then they were just as cut off as the British. The situation maps of the fighting along the roads leading to Imphal resembled a slice of marble cake as both sides used the jungle to outflank each other. Another major change by the British was that use of air support both as an offensive weapon to replace artillery, and as a logistical tool to transport men and equipment. For example, the [[5th Indian Infantry Division]] was airlifted straight from the now quieter Arakan front up to the central front and were in action within days of arriving. By the end of the campaigning season both Kohima and Imphal had been relieved and the Japanese were in full retreat.\n\nThe lessons learnt in Burma of how to fight in the jungle and how to use air transport to move troops around would lay the foundations of how to conduct large scale jungle campaigns in future wars.\n\n===Unconventional jungle warfare===\nImmediately after the fall of Malaya and Singapore in 1942, a few British officers, such as [[Freddie Spencer Chapman]], eluded capture and escaped into the central Malaysian jungle where they helped organize and train bands of lightly armed local [[Malaysian Chinese|ethnic Chinese]] communists into a capable guerrilla force against the Japanese occupiers. What began as desperate initiatives by several determined British officers probably inspired the subsequent formation of the above-mentioned early jungle-warfare forces.\nThe real pioneers who methodically developed it as a specialized branch of warfare - the unconventional, low-intensity, guerrilla-style type of warfare as it is understood today - were probably the British and Australians. [[V Force]] and [[Force 136]] were composed of small bodies of soldiers and irregulars, equipped with no more than small arms and explosives, but rigorously trained in guerrilla warfare-style tactics (particularly in close-quarter combat) who fought behind enemy lines. They were joined in Burma by American led Kachin guerrillas were armed and coordinated by the American liaison organisation, [[OSS Detachment 101]] that led,  armed, and coordinated them.\n\nAnother small force operating in the Far East was the Australian led [[Z Special Unit]] that carried out a total of 81 covert operations in the [[South West Pacific theatre]] some of which involved jungle warfare.\n\n===Cold War===\n\n====British experience in the Malayan Emergency====\n[[File:Sempreatentos...aoperigo!.jpg|thumb|right|[[Portuguese Army]] special ''[[ca\u00e7adores]]'' advancing in the African jungle in the early 1960s, during the Angola War of Independence.]] \nAfter the war, early skills in jungle warfare were further honed in the [[Malayan Emergency]], when in 1948 guerrilla fighters of the [[Malayan Communist Party]] (MCP) turned against the Commonwealth. In addition to jungle discipline, field craft, and survival skills, special tactics such as combat tracking (first using native trackers), close-quarter fighting (tactics were developed by troopers protected only with fencing masks stalking and shooting each other in the jungle training ground with air rifles), small team operations (which led to the typical four-man special operations teams) and tree jumping (parachuting into the jungle and through the rain forest canopy) were developed from Borneo's [[Iban people|Iban]] native to actively take the war to the Communist guerrillas instead of reacting to incidents initiated by them.\n\nOf greater importance was the integration of the tactical jungle warfare with the strategic \"[[winning hearts and minds]]\" psychological, economic and political warfare as a complete [[counter-insurgency]] package. The Malayan Emergency was declared over in 1960 as the surviving [[Communism|Communist]] [[guerrillas]] were driven to the jungle near the Thai border, where they remained until they gave up their armed struggle in 1989.\n\n[[Image:Singapore Army Combat Trackers in Brunei, early 1980s.jpg|thumb|left|Singapore Army Combat Trackers, a little known elite four-team jungle warfare unit, in Brunei during the early 1980s.]]\n\n====Cuban Revolution and Che Guevara====\n{{Main|Cuban Revolution}}\n\n====Brazilian military government guerrilla====\n{{Main|Brazilian military government}}\n\n====Portuguese Colonial War====\n{{Main|Portuguese Colonial War}}\nIn the 1960s and early 1970s, Portugal was engaged in jungle warfare operations in Africa, against the independentist guerrillas of [[Portuguese Angola|Angola]], [[Portuguese Guinea]] and [[Portuguese Mozambique|Mozambique]]. These operations were part of what is collectively known as the \"[[Portuguese Colonial War]]\". In fact, there were three different wars: the [[Angolan Independence War]], the [[Guinea-Bissau War of Independence]] and the [[Mozambican War of Independence]]. The situation was unique in that small armed forces &ndash; [[Portuguese Armed Forces|those of Portugal]] &ndash; were able to conduct three large scale counterinsurgency wars at the same time, each in a different [[theatre of operations]], each one separated by thousands of [[kilometer]]s from the others. For these operations, Portugal developed its own counterinsurgency and jungle warfare doctrines.<ref>Cann, Jonh P., ''Counterinsurgency in Africa: The Portuguese Way of War, 1961-1974'', Hailer Publishing, 2005.</ref>\n\n====Vietnam War====\nThe British experience in counter insurgency was passed onto the Americans during their involvement in the [[Vietnam War]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tamilnation.org/armed_conflict/thompson.htm|title=Web Page Under Construction|website=www.tamilnation.org}}</ref>  where the battlegrounds were, again, the jungle.

Between 1956 and 1965, this same installation in Hawaii was home to the Jungle and Guerilla Warfare Training Center followed by the Recondo School from 1971 to 1979. The United States' Asia-Pacific Rebalance Strategy necessitated jungle warfare training for the US Military be increased in priority. JOTC's revival at its original location in Hawaii is in part due to closure of the Fort Sherman, Panama JOTC location in 1999 (The majority of jungle specific training was transitioned to Fort Sherman, Panama during 1970's).<gallery widths=\"160\">\nFile:Guereiro de Selva (26700074065).jpg|Brazilian Jungle Warfare Training Center.\nFile:Jungle Warfare School 160616-A-AR772-028.jpg|French Jungle Warfare School, in the French Guyana.\nFile:US Navy 070928-N-4267W-005 An instructor with Jungle Warfare Training Command (JWTC) supervises Seabees with Naval Mobile Construction Battalion (NMCB) 7.jpg|JOTC in Okinawa, Japan.\n</gallery>\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==References==\n*{{cite book|ref=harv|last=Cowley|first=Robert|last2=Parker|first2=Geoffrey|year=2001|title=The Reader's Companion to Military History |edition=illustrated|publisher=Houghton Mifflin Harcourt|isbn=0-618-12742-9|page=[https://books.google.com/books?id=qOEu4ALwR-IC&lpg=PA511&ots=sirDDd8IQk&dq=longest%20retreat%20in%20British%20military%20history&pg=PA511#v=onepage&q=longest%20retreat%20in%20British%20military%20history&f=true 511]}}\n\n==Further reading==\n*{{cite book|ref=harv|last=Barber|first=Noel|title=The War of the Running Dogs: How Malaya Defeated the Communist Guerrillas, 1948-60|location=London|publisher=Orion Publishing Group/Cassell Military Paperbacks|year=2005}}\n*{{cite book|ref=harv|last=Baudrier|first=Michael|title=Love & Terror in Malaya|isbn= 1-4120-5171-1|publisher=Trafford Publishing|year=2005}}\n*{{cite book|ref=harv|last=Chapman|first=Spencer|title=The Jungle is Neutral|publisher=Guilford, CT: Lyons Press|year=2003 |origyear=1949}}\n*{{cite book|ref=harv|last=Forty|first=George|title=Japanese Army handbook 1939-1945|publisher=Stroud, Gloucestershire: Sutton Publishing|year=1999}}\n*{{cite book|ref=harv|last=Marchall|first=Brig.

It includes territory on both the north and the south sides of the Mohawk River.\n\n==History==\nThis area of the river valley was historically occupied by the [[Mohawk people]], the easternmost of the Five Nations comprising the [[Iroquois Confederacy]] or ''[[Haudenosaunee]]''. They cultivated [[maize]] fields in the flats along the Mohawk River and had villages in the hills.\n\nEuropean settlement started in the present-day county by Dutch colonists in the 17th century; the village of Schenectady was founded in 1661. The [[fur trade]]rs in Albany kept a monopoly and prohibited settlers in Schenectady from the trade; those residents mostly became farmers. Other areas of the county were also developed for farming. The English enforced the Albany monopoly on the fur trade when they took over the New Netherland colony in 1664.\n\nThe English organized counties in the [[Province of New York]] in 1683; the area of the present-day Schenectady County was included in [[Albany County, New York|Albany County]]. Albany County contained an enormous area, including the northern part of New York State as well as all of the present State of [[Vermont]] and, in theory, extending westward to the [[Pacific Ocean]]. This county was reduced in size on July 3, 1766, by the creation of [[Cumberland County, New York|Cumberland County]], and further on March 16, 1770, by the creation of [[Gloucester County, New York|Gloucester County]], both containing territory now within the state of [[Vermont]].\n\nOn March 12, 1772, Albany County was divided to form two other counties. The area of Schenectady County was still within the reduced Albany.\n\nFrom 1772 to 1786 Albany County included, besides the present territory of Albany County, all of the present [[Columbia County, New York|Columbia]], [[Rensselaer County, New York|Rensselaer]], [[Saratoga County, New York|Saratoga]], and Schenectady counties, parts of the present [[Greene County, New York|Greene]] and [[Washington County, New York|Washington]] counties, and a piece of what is now southwestern Vermont.\n\nIn 1786 Albany County was reduced in size when [[Columbia County, New York|Columbia County]] was organized; and again in 1791 by the splitting off of [[Rensselaer County, New York|Rensselaer]] and [[Saratoga County, New York|Saratoga]] counties and the transfer of the [[Cambridge (town), New York|Town of Cambridge]] to [[Washington County, New York|Washington County]]. It was further reduced in size in 1795 by the splitting off of a part that was combined with a portion of [[Otsego County, New York|Otsego County]] to create [[Schoharie County, New York|Schoharie County]]. It was further reduced in size in 1800 by the splitting off of a part that was combined with a portion of [[Ulster County, New York|Ulster County]] to create [[Greene County, New York|Greene County]].\n\nIn 1809, Schenectady County was split from Albany County and has kept its current borders. The city of Schenectady was designated as the county seat and is the only city in the county. Major European immigration began in the mid-19th century, with the arrival of Irish refugees from the [[Great Famine (Ireland)|Great Famine]]. More immigrants were attracted to the city for its industrial jobs, including those from Italy and Poland. In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, the city became an industrial powerhouse and center of innovation, the headquarters of [[General Electric]] and other national corporations.\n\nThe city of Schenectady reached its peak of population in 1930 but the county reached its peak in 1970, according to US Census data (see table below for county data.) These differences reflect different settlement patterns and the development of suburban housing outside the city limits. The city of Schenectady lost many jobs and population in the late 20th century due to industrial and railroad restructuring; some people stayed in the county working at alternative positions, including commuting to the capital of Albany.\n\n==Geography==\nAccording to the [[U.S. Census Bureau]], the county has a total area of {{convert|209|sqmi}}, of which {{convert|205|sqmi}} is land and {{convert|4.9|sqmi}} (2.3%) is water.<ref name=\"GR1\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/geo/maps-data/data/docs/gazetteer/counties_list_36.txt|publisher=United States Census Bureau|accessdate=January 7, 2015|date=August 22, 2012|title=2010 Census Gazetteer Files|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140519062322/http://www.census.gov/geo/maps-data/data/docs/gazetteer/counties_list_36.txt|archivedate=May 19, 2014}}</ref>\n\nSchenectady County is located in east central New York State, northwest of [[Albany, New York|Albany]], an area usually considered \"[[Upstate New York|Upstate]]\".\n\n===Adjacent counties===\n* [[Saratoga County, New York|Saratoga County]] - northeast\n* [[Albany County, New York|Albany County]] - southeast\n* [[Schoharie County, New York|Schoharie County]] - southwest\n* [[Montgomery County, New York|Montgomery County]] - west\n\n==Demographics==\n{{US Census population\n|1810= 10201\n|1820= 13081\n|1830= 12347\n|1840= 17387\n|1850= 20054\n|1860= 20002\n|1870= 21347\n|1880= 23538\n|1890= 29797\n|1900= 46852\n|1910= 88235\n|1920= 109363\n|1930= 125021\n|1940= 122494\n|1950= 142497\n|1960= 152896\n|1970= 160979\n|1980= 149946\n|1990= 149285\n|2000= 146555\n|2010= 154727\n|estyear=2018\n|estimate=155350\n|estref=<ref name=\"USCensusEst2018\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/popest/data/tables.2018.html|title=Population and Housing Unit Estimates|accessdate=December 20, 2019}}</ref>\n|align-fn=center\n|footnote=U.S. Decennial Census<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/prod/www/decennial.html|title=U.S. Decennial Census|publisher=United States Census Bureau|accessdate=January 7, 2015}}</ref><br />1790-1960<ref>{{cite web|url=http://mapserver.lib.virginia.edu|title=Historical Census Browser|publisher=University of Virginia Library|accessdate=January 7, 2015}}</ref> 1900-1990<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/population/cencounts/ny190090.txt|title=Population of Counties by Decennial Census: 1900 to 1990|publisher=United States Census Bureau|accessdate=January 7, 2015}}</ref><br />1990-2000<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/population/www/cen2000/briefs/phc-t4/tables/tab02.pdf|title=Census 2000 PHC-T-4.

They have given small to moderate leads to Democrats since 1988 in presidential elections. The congressman [[Paul Tonko]] is a Democrat.\nLegislative authority is vested in the County Legislature, which consists of 15 members representing 8 communities, separated into four districts. The current composition of the Legislature is as follows (10 Democrats, 2 Republicans, and 3 Conservatives who caucus with the Democrats):\n\nDistrict 1 - [[Schenectady, New York|Schenectady]]:\n* {{Party shading/Democratic/block}} Karen B.

It includes territory on both the north and the south sides of the Mohawk River.\n\n==History==\nThis area of the river valley was historically occupied by the [[Mohawk people]], the easternmost of the Five Nations comprising the [[Iroquois Confederacy]] or ''[[Haudenosaunee]]''. They cultivated [[maize]] fields in the flats along the Mohawk River and had villages in the hills.\n\nEuropean settlement started in the present-day county by Dutch colonists in the 17th century; the village of Schenectady was founded in 1661. The [[fur trade]]rs in Albany kept a monopoly and prohibited settlers in Schenectady from the trade; those residents mostly became farmers. Other areas of the county were also developed for farming. The English enforced the Albany monopoly on the fur trade when they took over the New Netherland colony in 1664.\n\nThe English organized counties in the [[Province of New York]] in 1683; the area of the present-day Schenectady County was included in [[Albany County, New York|Albany County]]. Albany County contained an enormous area, including the northern part of New York State as well as all of the present State of [[Vermont]] and, in theory, extending westward to the [[Pacific Ocean]]. This county was reduced in size on July 3, 1766, by the creation of [[Cumberland County, New York|Cumberland County]], and further on March 16, 1770, by the creation of [[Gloucester County, New York|Gloucester County]], both containing territory now within the state of [[Vermont]].\n\nOn March 12, 1772, Albany County was divided to form two other counties. The area of Schenectady County was still within the reduced Albany.\n\nFrom 1772 to 1786 Albany County included, besides the present territory of Albany County, all of the present [[Columbia County, New York|Columbia]], [[Rensselaer County, New York|Rensselaer]], [[Saratoga County, New York|Saratoga]], and Schenectady counties, parts of the present [[Greene County, New York|Greene]] and [[Washington County, New York|Washington]] counties, and a piece of what is now southwestern Vermont.\n\nIn 1786 Albany County was reduced in size when [[Columbia County, New York|Columbia County]] was organized; and again in 1791 by the splitting off of [[Rensselaer County, New York|Rensselaer]] and [[Saratoga County, New York|Saratoga]] counties and the transfer of the [[Cambridge (town), New York|Town of Cambridge]] to [[Washington County, New York|Washington County]]. It was further reduced in size in 1795 by the splitting off of a part that was combined with a portion of [[Otsego County, New York|Otsego County]] to create [[Schoharie County, New York|Schoharie County]]. It was further reduced in size in 1800 by the splitting off of a part that was combined with a portion of [[Ulster County, New York|Ulster County]] to create [[Greene County, New York|Greene County]].\n\nIn 1809, Schenectady County was split from Albany County and has kept its current borders. The city of Schenectady was designated as the county seat and is the only city in the county. Major European immigration began in the mid-19th century, with the arrival of Irish refugees from the [[Great Famine (Ireland)|Great Famine]]. More immigrants were attracted to the city for its industrial jobs, including those from Italy and Poland. In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, the city became an industrial powerhouse and center of innovation, the headquarters of [[General Electric]] and other national corporations.\n\nThe city of Schenectady reached its peak of population in 1930 but the county reached its peak in 1970, according to US Census data (see table below for county data.) These differences reflect different settlement patterns and the development of suburban housing outside the city limits. The city of Schenectady lost many jobs and population in the late 20th century due to industrial and railroad restructuring; some people stayed in the county working at alternative positions, including commuting to the capital of Albany.\n\n==Geography==\nAccording to the [[U.S. Census Bureau]], the county has a total area of {{convert|209|sqmi}}, of which {{convert|205|sqmi}} is land and {{convert|4.9|sqmi}} (2.3%) is water.<ref name=\"GR1\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/geo/maps-data/data/docs/gazetteer/counties_list_36.txt|publisher=United States Census Bureau|accessdate=January 7, 2015|date=August 22, 2012|title=2010 Census Gazetteer Files|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140519062322/http://www.census.gov/geo/maps-data/data/docs/gazetteer/counties_list_36.txt|archivedate=May 19, 2014}}</ref>\n\nSchenectady County is located in east central New York State, northwest of [[Albany, New York|Albany]], an area usually considered \"[[Upstate New York|Upstate]]\".\n\n===Adjacent counties===\n*[[Saratoga County, New York|Saratoga County]] - northeast\n*[[Albany County, New York|Albany County]] - southeast\n*[[Schoharie County, New York|Schoharie County]] - southwest\n*[[Montgomery County, New York|Montgomery County]] - west\n\n==Demographics==\n{{US Census population\n|1810= 10201\n|1820= 13081\n|1830= 12347\n|1840= 17387\n|1850= 20054\n|1860= 20002\n|1870= 21347\n|1880= 23538\n|1890= 29797\n|1900= 46852\n|1910= 88235\n|1920= 109363\n|1930= 125021\n|1940= 122494\n|1950= 142497\n|1960= 152896\n|1970= 160979\n|1980= 149946\n|1990= 149285\n|2000= 146555\n|2010= 154727\n|estyear=2018\n|estimate=155350\n|estref=<ref name=\"USCensusEst2018\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/popest/data/tables.2018.html|title=Population and Housing Unit Estimates|accessdate=December 20, 2019}}</ref>\n|align-fn=center\n|footnote=U.S. Decennial Census<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/prod/www/decennial.html|title=U.S. Decennial Census|publisher=United States Census Bureau|accessdate=January 7, 2015}}</ref><br />1790-1960<ref>{{cite web|url=http://mapserver.lib.virginia.edu|title=Historical Census Browser|publisher=University of Virginia Library|accessdate=January 7, 2015}}</ref> 1900-1990<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/population/cencounts/ny190090.txt|title=Population of Counties by Decennial Census: 1900 to 1990|publisher=United States Census Bureau|accessdate=January 7, 2015}}</ref><br />1990-2000<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/population/www/cen2000/briefs/phc-t4/tables/tab02.pdf|title=Census 2000 PHC-T-4.

Achim Christoph Friedrich Schulz in his ''Kleine Romane'' (1790), which was the Grimms' direct source, the owner of the garden is a [[fairy]] (\"''Fee''\"), and also appears as such in the Grimms' first edition of ''Kinder- und Hausm\u00e4rchen'' (1812); by the final edition of 1857 the Grimms had deliberately Germanized the story by changing her to the more Teutonic \"sorceress\" (\"''Zauberin''\"), just as they had changed the original \"prince\" (\"''Prinz''\") to the Germanic \"son of a king\" (\"''K\u00f6nigssohn''\"). At no point, however, do they refer to her as a \"[[witch]]\" ({{lang-de|Hexe}}), despite the common modern impression.</ref> The wife, experiencing the cravings associated with pregnancy, notices some [[Valerianella locusta|rapunzel]] (a salad green) growing in the nearby garden and longs for it.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://german.berkeley.edu/poetry/rapunzel.php|title=Translating Rapunzel; A very Long Process|last=Rinkes|first=Kathleen J.|date=17 April 2001|website=Department of German: University of California Berkeley|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120122211814/http://german.berkeley.edu/poetry/rapunzel.php|archive-date=24 September 2017|access-date=30 March 2020}}</ref> She refuses to eat anything else and begins to waste away. Her husband fears for her life and one night he breaks into the garden to get some for her. When he returns, she makes a salad out of it and eats it, but she longs for more so her husband returns to the garden to retrieve more. As he scales the wall to return home, the sorceress catches him and accuses him of theft. He begs for mercy and she agrees to be lenient, allowing him to take all the rapunzel he wants on condition that the baby be given to her when it's born.<ref>In some variants of the story, the request takes a more riddling form, ''e. g.,'' the foster mother demands \"that which is under your belt.\" In other variants, the mother, worn out by the squalling of the child, wishes for someone to take it away, whereupon the figure of the foster-mother appears to claim it. ''Cf.'' the Grimms' annotations to ''Rapunzel'' (''Kinder- und Hausm\u00e4rchen'' (1856), Vol. III, p. 22.)</ref> Desperate, he agrees. When his wife has a baby girl, the sorceress takes her to raise as her own and names her \"Rapunzel\" after the plant her mother craved. She grows up to be a beautiful child with long golden hair.<ref>In Schulz, this is caused by the fairy herself, who sprinkles the child with a \"precious liquid/perfume/ointment\" ({{lang-de|kostbaren Wasser}}). Her hair according to Schulz is thirty ells long (112 1/2 feet or 34.29 meters), but not at all uncomfortable for her to wear (''Kleine Romane'', p. 277); in the Grimms it hangs twenty ells (75 feet/22.86 meters) from the window-hook to the ground. (''Kinder- und Hausm\u00e4rchen'' (1857) Vol. I., p. 66.).</ref> When she turns twelve, the sorceress locks her up inside a tower in the middle of the woods, with neither stairs nor a door, and only one room and one window.<ref>In Schulz's 1790 version of the story, the purpose of the fairy in doing so is to protect Rapunzel from an \"unlucky star\" which threatens her (''Kleine Romane'', p. 275); the Grimms (deliberately seeking to return to a more archaic form of the story and perhaps influenced by Basile's Italian variant) make the fairy/sorceress a much more threatening figure.</ref> In order to visit Rapunzel, the sorceress stands beneath the tower and calls out:\n\n:''Rapunzel!''\n:''Rapunzel!''\n:''Let down your hair''\n:''That I may climb thy golden stair!''<ref>Schulz, \"''Rapunzel, la\u00df deine Haare 'runter, da\u00df ich 'rauf kann.''\" ({{lang-de|Rapunzel, let down thy hairs, so I can [climb] up.}}) (''Kleine Romane'', p. 278); Grimms, \"''Rapunzel, Rapunzel, la\u00df dein Haar herunter!'' ({{lang-de|Rapunzel, Rapunzel, let downwards thy hair!}}) (''Kinder- und Hausm\u00e4rchen'' (1857) Vol. I., p. 66.) Jacob Grimm believed that the strong alliteration of the rhyme indicated that it was a survival of the ancient form of Germanic poetry known as \"''[[Stabreim]]''.\"</ref>\n\nOne day, a [[prince]] rides through the forest and hears Rapunzel singing from the tower. Entranced by her ethereal voice, he searches for her and discovers the tower, but is unable to enter it. He returns often, listening to her beautiful singing, and one day sees the sorceress visit and learns how to gain access. When the sorceress leaves, he bids Rapunzel let her hair down. When she does so, he climbs up and they fall in love. He eventually asks her to [[Marriage|marry]] him, which she agrees to. \n\nTogether they plan a means of escape, wherein he will come each night (thus avoiding the sorceress who visits her by day) and bring Rapunzel a piece of [[silk]] that she will gradually weave into a [[rope ladder|ladder]]. Before the plan can come to fruition, however, she foolishly gives him away. In the first edition (1812) of ''Kinder- und Hausm\u00e4rchen'' ({{lang-de|Children's and Household Tales}}, most commonly known in English as ''[[Grimm's Fairy Tales]]''), she innocently says that her dress is growing tighter around her waist, hinting at [[pregnancy]].<ref>This detail is also found in Schulz, ''Kleine Romane'', p. 281.</ref> In later editions, she asks \"Dame Gothel\"<ref>{{lang-de|Frau Gothel}}. Rapunzel refers to the previously unnamed sorceress by this title only at this point in the Grimms' story. The use of ''Frau'' in early modern German was more restricted, and referred only to a woman of noble birth, rather than to any woman as in modern German.  \"''Gothel''\" (or ''G\u00f6thel, G\u00f6thle, G\u00f6the, etc''.) was originally not a personal name, but an occupational one meaning \"[[midwife]], [[wet nurse]], [[foster mother]], [[Godparent]]\" ({{lang-de|Amme, Ammefrau; Taufpate}}). ''Cf.'' Ernst Ludwig Rochholz's ''Deutsche Arbeits-Entw\u00fcrfe'', Vol. II, p. 150. The Grimms' use of this archaic term was another example of their attempt to return the story to a primitive Teutonic form.</ref>, in a moment of forgetfulness, why it is easier for her to draw up the prince than her.<ref name=facts>Maria Tatar (1987) ''The Hard Facts of the Grimms' Fairy Tales'', Princeton University Press, p. 18, {{ISBN|0-691-06722-8}}</ref>  In anger, the sorceress cuts off a majority of Rapunzel's hair and casts her out into the wilderness to fend for herself.\n\nWhen the prince calls that night, the sorceress lets the severed hair down to haul him up. To his horror, he finds himself meeting her instead of Rapunzel, who is nowhere to be found. After she tells him in a rage that he will never see Rapunzel again, he leaps or falls from the tower, landing in a thorn bush. Although the thorn bush breaks his fall and saves his life, it scratches his eyes and blinds him.\n\nFor years, he wanders through the wastelands of the country and eventually comes to the wilderness where Rapunzel now lives with the twins to whom she has given birth, a boy and a girl. One day, as she sings, he hears her voice again, and they are reunited. When they fall into each other's arms her tears immediately restore his sight. He leads her and their twins to his kingdom where they live happily ever after.<ref>In Schulz, the fairy, relenting from her anger, transports the whole family to his father's palace in her flying carriage. ''Kleine Romane'', pp. 287-288.</ref>\n\nAnother version of the story ends with the revelation that her foster mother had untied Rapunzel's hair after the prince leapt from the tower, and it slipped from her hands and landed far below, leaving her trapped in the tower.<ref name=\"wbarker\">Jacob and Wilhelm Grimm (1884) ''Household Tales'' (English translation by Margaretmm Hunt), \"[http://myweb.dal.ca/barkerb/fairies/grimm/012.html Rapunzel]\"</ref>\n\n==Themes and characterization==\n[[File:Dresden Altmarkt 14.jpg|right|thumb|upright|Rapunzel in [[Dresden]], [[Saxony]], Germany]]\nMany scholars have interpreted \u201cMaiden in the Tower\u201d stories, which Rapunzel is a part of, as a metaphor for the protection of young woman from pre-martial relationships by overzealous guardians.<ref name=\":2\" /> Scholars have drawn comparisons of the confinement of Rapunzel in her tower to that of a convent, where women\u2019s lives where highly controlled and they lived in exclusion from outsiders.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nScholars have also noted the strong theme of love conquering all in the story, as the lovers are united after years of searching in all versions after ''[[Charlotte-Rose de Caumont de La Force|Persinette]]'' and are ultimately happily reunited as a family.<ref name=\":4\">{{Cite journal|last=Vellenga|first=Carolyn|date=1992|title=Rapunzel's desire.

It aired on 5 February 1983. In it, the main character, Rapunzel ([[Shelley Duvall]]), is taken from her mother ([[Shelley Duvall]]) and father ([[Jeff Bridges]]) by an evil witch ([[Gena Rowlands]]), and is brought up in an isolated tower that can only be accessed by climbing her unnaturally long hair. [[Jeff Bridges]] played the prince and also Rapunzel's father, [[Shelley Duvall]] played Rapunzel and also Rapunzel's mother, [[Gena Rowlands]] played the witch, and [[Roddy McDowall]] narrated.\n* The story is retold in a second season (1987) episode of ''[[Grimm's Fairy Tale Classics]]'', aka ''Grimm Masterpiece Theatre.''<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0305033/?ref_=fn_al_tt_1|title=Grimm Masterpiece Theatre (TV Series 1987\u2013 )|author=Cloud Strife|date=15 January 2008|work=IMDb}}</ref>\n* A 1988 German film adaption, ''{{ill|Rapunzel oder Der Zauber der Tr\u00e4nen|de}}'' (meaning \"Rapunzel or the Magic of Tears\"), combines the story with the lesser known Grimm fairy tale [[Maid Maleen]]. After escaping the tower, Rapunzel finds work as a kitchen maid in the prince's court, where she must contend with an evil princess who aims to marry him.\n* A 1990 [[straight-to-video]] animated film adaption by [[Hanna-Barbera]] and [[Hallmark Cards]], simply titled ''Rapunzel''<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1217949/|title=Timeless Tales from Hallmark Rapunzel (TV Episode 1990)|date=13 March 1990|work=IMDb}}</ref> featured [[Olivia Newton-John]] narrating the story. The major difference between it and the Grimm fairy tale is that instead of making the prince blind, the evil witch transforms him into a bird, possibly a reference to ''[[The Blue Bird (fairy tale)|The Blue Bird]]'', a French variant of the story.\n* ''[[Into the Woods]]'' is a musical combining elements from several classic fairy tales, in which Rapunzel is one of the main characters; it was also filmed for television<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0099851/|title=\"American Playhouse\" Into the Woods (TV Episode 1991)|author=weymo|date=15 March 1991|work=IMDb}}</ref> in 1991 by ''[[American Playhouse]]''. The story depicts Rapunzel as the adoptive daughter of the Witch that the Baker (Rapunzel\u2019s younger brother, unbeknownst to him) is getting some items from who is later rescued by a prince. In the second half of the play, Rapunzel is killed by the Giant's Wife. The Witch then grieves for her and sings, \"Witch\u2019s Lament.\"\n** A [[Into the Woods (film)|film adaptation]] by [[The Walt Disney Company]] was released late in 2014<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2180411/|title=Into the Woods (2014)|author=isaacglover_05|date=25 December 2014|work=IMDb}}</ref> where Rapunzel is portrayed by [[Mackenzie Mauzy]]. The difference from the play is that Rapunzel is not killed by the Giant's Wife. Instead, she rides off into the woods with her prince in order to distance herself from the Witch that raised her.\n* In ''[[Barbie as Rapunzel]]'' (2002), Rapunzel was raised by the evil witch Gothel (voiced by [[Anjelica Huston]]) and she acted as a servant for her. She uses a magic paintbrush to get out of captivity, but Gothel locks her away in a tower.\n* In ''[[Shrek the Third]]'' (2007), Rapunzel (voiced by [[Maya Rudolph]]) was friends with Princess Fiona. She is shown to be the true love of the evil Prince Charming and helps to fool Princess Fiona and her group when they try to escape from Prince Charming's wrath.\n* [[Walt Disney Animation Studios]]' ''[[Tangled]]'' (2010), which is a loose retelling and a computer animated musical feature film.

A woman named Mother Gothel (voiced by [[Donna Murphy]]) kidnaps Rapunzel for her magical hair which would help maintain her youth. [[Flynn Rider]]/Eugene Fitzherbert (voiced by [[Zachary Levi]]) is an elusive thief who replaces the prince.<ref>[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0398286/ Tangled (2010)].

[[Carol Lynley]] played Rapunzel and [[Agnes Moorehead]] the evil witch. \n\n''[[Sesame Street]]'' has a \"News Flash\" skit with [[Kermit the Frog]] where he interviews the Prince trying to charm Rapunzel with the famous line. However, she is having a hard time hearing him and when she finally does understand him, she literally lets all her hair fall down (completely off her head), leaving the prince confused as to what to do now.\n\nIn the U.S. TV animated anthology series ''[[Happily Ever After: Fairy Tales for Every Child]]'' (1.8, Rapunzel), the classic story is retold with a full [[African Americans|African-American]] cast and set in [[New Orleans]]. The episode starred [[Tisha Campbell-Martin]] as Rapunzel, [[Whoopi Goldberg]] as Zenobia the Hoodoo Diva, [[Meshach Taylor]] as Woodcutter, [[Hazelle Goodman]] as Woodcutter's Wife, [[Donald Fullilove]] as Friend #1, and [[Tico Wells]] as Friend #2.\n\nIn the American Fairytale Miniseries, ''[[The Tenth Kingdom]]'', the main character, Virginia Lewis is cursed by a Gypsy witch. As a result, she grows hair reminiscent of Rapunzel's and is locked away by the Huntsman in a tower. Her only means of escape is by letting her hair down through the window of the tower so that the Wolf can climb up and rescue her. Not before he asks the iconic phrase, in his own way, \"Love of my life, let down your lustrous locks!\". The character, Rapunzel is also mentioned as being one of the great women who changed history. And was Queen of the sixth Kingdom before eventually succumbing to old age.\n\nIn the [[Mattel]] cartoon [[Ever After High]], Rapunzel has two daughters: Holly O'Hair and Poppy O'Hair.\n\nRapunzel appears in the ''[[Once Upon a Time (TV series)|Once Upon a Time]]'' episode \"[[The Tower (Once Upon a Time)|The Tower]]\", portrayed by Alexandra Metz. In this show, Rapunzel is a young woman who becomes trapped in a large tower for many years, after she searched for a plant called \"nightroot\" which would remove her fear of becoming Queen following her brother's death. Because of this, she owns extremely long hair. However, it is revealed that consuming the substance instead creates a doppelg\u00e4nger fear spirit who represents all of the person's worst fears. After Prince Charming begins to fear that he will not make a good father to his and Snow White's baby, Robin Hood tells him where to find night-root. He then climbs the tower and eventually helps Rapunzel face her fears by facing what truly scares her: herself. Presented with her own doppelganger, she is encouraged by David and cuts off her hair, killing the figure and allowing her freedom. She explains to David that her brother died trying to save her, and her doubts that her parents will forgive her. Again encouraged by David, he returns her to their palace where she reunites with her accepting parents.\n\n''[[Tangled: The Series]]'' is a 2D animated TV show based on [[The Walt Disney Company|Disney]] [[Walt Disney Animation Studios|Animation's]] computer animated musical feature film'' [[Tangled]]''. Mandy Moore and Zachary Levi reprise their roles of [[Rapunzel (Tangled)|Rapunzel]] and [[Eugene Fitzherbert]]. A new main character named Cassandra appears, who is Rapunzel's feisty lady-in-waiting. The series has a feature-length movie titled ''[[Tangled: Before Ever After]]''.\n\nIn one episode of ''Happy Tree Friends'' entitled ''Dunce Upon a Time'', Petunia has very long hair which Giggles uses to slide down on as a brief Rapunzel reference.\n\nA second iteration of Rapunzel appears as one of the main antagonists in the seventh season of ''Once Upon a Time'', portrayed by [[Gabrielle Anwar]] and [[Meegan Warner]] in flashbacks. In this season, Rapunzel is Lady Tremaine, the wicked stepmother to [[Cinderella]]. In the past, Rapunzel had two daughters named [[Anastasia Tremaine|Anastasia]] and [[Drizella Tremaine|Drizella]], and made a deal with [[Mother Gothel]] to be locked in a tower in exchange for the safety of her family. Six years later, Rapunzel frees herself and when she returns to her family, she discovers she has gained a stepdaughter named Ella. At some point, Anastasia dies and Rapunzel blames her husband for the incident while Ella blames herself. Gothel plans to put Anastasia in the tower, but Rapunzel managed to turn the tables and lock Gothel in instead. Rapunzel plots to revive Anastasia by using the heart of Drizella, whom she favors least of the two daughters. Drizella discovers this and decides to get revenge on her mother by casting the Dark Curse. She allies with Mother Gothel and sends the New Enchanted Forest residents to [[Hyperion Heights]] in [[Seattle]]. Rapunzel is awake from the curse, but lives as Victoria Belfrey and is given new memories making her believe she cast the curse to save Anastasia, while Drizella lives as Ivy Belfrey, her assistant and daughter. Cinderella and her daughter are also brought over by the curse. Rapunzel/Victoria manages to lock Gothel away in Belfrey Towers.\n\nThe Japanese anime series ''[[Grimm's Fairy Tale Classics]]'' features the tale in its second season. It gives more spotlight to Rapunzel's parents, who are the local blacksmith and his wife, and it makes Gothel more openly villainous.\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Children's literature}}\n* [[Ethniu]], daughter of [[Balor]]\n* [[Rapunzel syndrome]]\n* [[Dana\u00eb]], daughter of King Acrisius and Queen Eurydice, who was shut up in a bronze tower or cave.\n* [[Puddocky]]\n* [[Maid Maleen]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Commons category}}\n{{Wikisource}}\n* [http://www.pitt.edu/~dash/grimmtales.html D.L.

Achim Christoph Friedrich Schulz in his ''Kleine Romane'' (1790), which was the Grimms' direct source, the owner of the garden is a [[fairy]] (\"''Fee''\"), and also appears as such in the Grimms' first edition of ''Kinder- und Hausm\u00e4rchen'' (1812); by the final edition of 1857 the Grimms had deliberately Germanized the story by changing her to the more Teutonic \"sorceress\" (\"''Zauberin''\"), just as they had changed the original \"prince\" (\"''Prinz''\") to the Germanic \"son of a king\" (\"''K\u00f6nigssohn''\"). At no point, however, do they refer to her as a \"[[witch]]\" ({{lang-de|Hexe}}), despite the common modern impression.</ref> The wife, experiencing the cravings associated with pregnancy, notices some [[Valerianella locusta|rapunzel]] (a salad green) growing in the nearby garden and longs for it.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://german.berkeley.edu/poetry/rapunzel.php|title=Translating Rapunzel; A very Long Process|last=Rinkes|first=Kathleen J.|date=17 April 2001|website=Department of German: University of California Berkeley|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120122211814/http://german.berkeley.edu/poetry/rapunzel.php|archive-date=24 September 2017|access-date=30 March 2020}}</ref> She refuses to eat anything else and begins to waste away. Her husband fears for her life and one night he breaks into the garden to get some for her. When he returns, she makes a salad out of it and eats it, but she longs for more so her husband returns to the garden to retrieve more. As he scales the wall to return home, the sorceress catches him and accuses him of theft. He begs for mercy and she agrees to be lenient, allowing him to take all the rapunzel he wants on condition that the baby be given to her when it's born.<ref>In some variants of the story, the request takes a more riddling form, ''e. g.,'' the foster mother demands \"that which is under your belt.\" In other variants, the mother, worn out by the squalling of the child, wishes for someone to take it away, whereupon the figure of the foster-mother appears to claim it. ''Cf.'' the Grimms' annotations to ''Rapunzel'' (''Kinder- und Hausm\u00e4rchen'' (1856), Vol. III, p. 22.)</ref> Desperate, he agrees. When his wife has a baby girl, the sorceress takes her to raise as her own and names her \"Rapunzel\" after the plant her mother craved. She grows up to be a beautiful child with long golden hair.<ref>In Schulz, this is caused by the fairy herself, who sprinkles the child with a \"precious liquid/perfume/ointment\" ({{lang-de|kostbaren Wasser}}). Her hair according to Schulz is thirty ells long (112 1/2 feet or 34.29 meters), but not at all uncomfortable for her to wear (''Kleine Romane'', p. 277); in the Grimms it hangs twenty ells (75 feet/22.86 meters) from the window-hook to the ground. (''Kinder- und Hausm\u00e4rchen'' (1857) Vol. I., p. 66.).</ref> When she turns twelve, the sorceress locks her up inside a tower in the middle of the woods, with neither stairs nor a door, and only one room and one window.<ref>In Schulz's 1790 version of the story, the purpose of the fairy in doing so is to protect Rapunzel from an \"unlucky star\" which threatens her (''Kleine Romane'', p. 275); the Grimms (deliberately seeking to return to a more archaic form of the story and perhaps influenced by Basile's Italian variant) make the fairy/sorceress a much more threatening figure.</ref> In order to visit Rapunzel, the sorceress stands beneath the tower and calls out:\n\n:''Rapunzel!''\n:''Rapunzel!''\n:''Let down your hair''\n:''That I may climb thy golden stair!''<ref>Schulz, \"''Rapunzel, la\u00df deine Haare 'runter, da\u00df ich 'rauf kann.''\" ({{lang-de|Rapunzel, let down thy hairs, so I can [climb] up.}}) (''Kleine Romane'', p. 278); Grimms, \"''Rapunzel, Rapunzel, la\u00df dein Haar herunter!'' ({{lang-de|Rapunzel, Rapunzel, let downwards thy hair!}}) (''Kinder- und Hausm\u00e4rchen'' (1857) Vol. I., p. 66.) Jacob Grimm believed that the strong alliteration of the rhyme indicated that it was a survival of the ancient form of Germanic poetry known as \"''[[Stabreim]]''.\"</ref>\n\nOne day, a [[prince]] rides through the forest and hears Rapunzel singing from the tower. Entranced by her ethereal voice, he searches for her and discovers the tower, but is unable to enter it. He returns often, listening to her beautiful singing, and one day sees the sorceress visit and learns how to gain access. When the sorceress leaves, he bids Rapunzel let her hair down. When she does so, he climbs up and they fall in love. He eventually asks her to [[Marriage|marry]] him, which she agrees to. \n\nTogether they plan a means of escape, wherein he will come each night (thus avoiding the sorceress who visits her by day) and bring Rapunzel a piece of [[silk]] that she will gradually weave into a [[rope ladder|ladder]]. Before the plan can come to fruition, however, she foolishly gives him away. In the first edition (1812) of ''Kinder- und Hausm\u00e4rchen'' ({{lang-de|Children's and Household Tales}}, most commonly known in English as ''[[Grimm's Fairy Tales]]''), she innocently says that her dress is growing tighter around her waist, hinting at [[pregnancy]].<ref>This detail is also found in Schulz, ''Kleine Romane'', p. 281.</ref> In later editions, she asks \"Dame Gothel\"<ref>{{lang-de|Frau Gothel}}. Rapunzel refers to the previously unnamed sorceress by this title only at this point in the Grimms' story. The use of ''Frau'' in early modern German was more restricted, and referred only to a woman of noble birth, rather than to any woman as in modern German.  \"''Gothel''\" (or ''G\u00f6thel, G\u00f6thle, G\u00f6the, etc''.) was originally not a personal name, but an occupational one meaning \"[[midwife]], [[wet nurse]], [[foster mother]], [[Godparent]]\" ({{lang-de|Amme, Ammefrau; Taufpate}}). ''Cf.'' Ernst Ludwig Rochholz's ''Deutsche Arbeits-Entw\u00fcrfe'', Vol. II, p. 150. The Grimms' use of this archaic term was another example of their attempt to return the story to a primitive Teutonic form.</ref>, in a moment of forgetfulness, why it is easier for her to draw up the prince than her.<ref name=facts>Maria Tatar (1987) ''The Hard Facts of the Grimms' Fairy Tales'', Princeton University Press, p. 18, {{ISBN|0-691-06722-8}}</ref>  In anger, the sorceress cuts off a majority of Rapunzel's hair and casts her out into the wilderness to fend for herself.\n\nWhen the prince calls that night, the sorceress lets the severed hair down to haul him up. To his horror, he finds himself meeting her instead of Rapunzel, who is nowhere to be found. After she tells him in a rage that he will never see Rapunzel again, he leaps or falls from the tower, landing in a thorn bush. Although the thorn bush breaks his fall and saves his life, it scratches his eyes and blinds him.\n\nFor years, he wanders through the wastelands of the country and eventually comes to the wilderness where Rapunzel now lives with the twins to whom she has given birth, a boy and a girl. One day, as she sings, he hears her voice again, and they are reunited. When they fall into each other's arms her tears immediately restore his sight. He leads her and their twins to his kingdom where they live happily ever after.<ref>In Schulz, the fairy, relenting from her anger, transports the whole family to his father's palace in her flying carriage.

As a result, she grows hair reminiscent of Rapunzel's and is locked away by the Huntsman in a tower. Her only means of escape is by letting her hair down through the window of the tower so that the Wolf can climb up and rescue her. Not before he asks the iconic phrase, in his own way, \"Love of my life, let down your lustrous locks!\". The character, Rapunzel is also mentioned as being one of the great women who changed history. And was Queen of the sixth Kingdom before eventually succumbing to old age.\n\nIn the [[Mattel]] cartoon [[Ever After High]], Rapunzel has two daughters: Holly O'Hair and Poppy O'Hair.\n\nRapunzel appears in the ''[[Once Upon a Time (TV series)|Once Upon a Time]]'' episode \"[[The Tower (Once Upon a Time)|The Tower]]\", portrayed by Alexandra Metz. In this show, Rapunzel is a young woman who becomes trapped in a large tower for many years, after she searched for a plant called \"nightroot\" which would remove her fear of becoming Queen following her brother's death. Because of this, she owns extremely long hair. However, it is revealed that consuming the substance instead creates a doppelg\u00e4nger fear spirit who represents all of the person's worst fears. After Prince Charming begins to fear that he will not make a good father to his and Snow White's baby, Robin Hood tells him where to find night-root. He then climbs the tower and eventually helps Rapunzel face her fears by facing what truly scares her: herself. Presented with her own doppelganger, she is encouraged by David and cuts off her hair, killing the figure and allowing her freedom. She explains to David that her brother died trying to save her, and her doubts that her parents will forgive her. Again encouraged by David, he returns her to their palace where she reunites with her accepting parents.\n\n''[[Tangled: The Series]]'' is a 2D animated TV show based on [[The Walt Disney Company|Disney]] [[Walt Disney Animation Studios|Animation's]] computer animated musical feature film'' [[Tangled]]''. Mandy Moore and Zachary Levi reprise their roles of [[Rapunzel (Tangled)|Rapunzel]] and [[Eugene Fitzherbert]]. A new main character named Cassandra appears, who is Rapunzel's feisty lady-in-waiting. The series has a feature-length movie titled ''[[Tangled: Before Ever After]]''.\n\nIn one episode of ''Happy Tree Friends'' entitled ''Dunce Upon a Time'', Petunia has very long hair which Giggles uses to slide down on as a brief Rapunzel reference.\n\nA second iteration of Rapunzel appears as one of the main antagonists in the seventh season of ''Once Upon a Time'', portrayed by [[Gabrielle Anwar]] and [[Meegan Warner]] in flashbacks. In this season, Rapunzel is Lady Tremaine, the wicked stepmother to [[Cinderella]]. In the past, Rapunzel had two daughters named [[Anastasia Tremaine|Anastasia]] and [[Drizella Tremaine|Drizella]], and made a deal with [[Mother Gothel]] to be locked in a tower in exchange for the safety of her family. Six years later, Rapunzel frees herself and when she returns to her family, she discovers she has gained a stepdaughter named Ella. At some point, Anastasia dies and Rapunzel blames her husband for the incident while Ella blames herself. Gothel plans to put Anastasia in the tower, but Rapunzel managed to turn the tables and lock Gothel in instead. Rapunzel plots to revive Anastasia by using the heart of Drizella, whom she favors least of the two daughters. Drizella discovers this and decides to get revenge on her mother by casting the Dark Curse. She allies with Mother Gothel and sends the New Enchanted Forest residents to [[Hyperion Heights]] in [[Seattle]]. Rapunzel is awake from the curse, but lives as Victoria Belfrey and is given new memories making her believe she cast the curse to save Anastasia, while Drizella lives as Ivy Belfrey, her assistant and daughter. Cinderella and her daughter are also brought over by the curse. Rapunzel/Victoria manages to lock Gothel away in Belfrey Towers.\n\nThe Japanese anime series ''[[Grimm's Fairy Tale Classics]]'' features the tale in its second season. It gives more spotlight to Rapunzel's parents, who are the local blacksmith and his wife, and it makes Gothel more openly villainous.\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Children's literature}}\n* [[Ethniu]], daughter of [[Balor]]\n* [[Rapunzel syndrome]]\n* [[Dana\u00eb]], daughter of King Acrisius and Queen Eurydice, who was shut up in a bronze tower or cave.\n* [[Puddocky]]\n* [[Maid Maleen]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Commons category}}\n{{Wikisource}}\n* [http://www.pitt.edu/~dash/grimmtales.html D.L.

Selling more than one million copies in total, it produced six singles, including \"Seine Stra\u00dfen\" and \"Sie sieht mich nicht\", the latter of which served as the theme song for ''[[Ast\u00e9rix & Ob\u00e9lix Take On Caesar|Ast\u00e9rix & Ob\u00e9lix Take on Caesar]]'' (1999). After his highly publicized departure from 3P, his third studio album ''Zwischenspiel \u2013 Alles f\u00fcr den Herrn'' was released in 2002. It spawned the top five hit singles \"Wo willst du hin?\" and \"Abschied nehmen\" and led to a collaboration with [[Wu-Tang Clan]] member and producer [[RZA]], with whom he released his first number-one single \"Ich kenne nichts (das so sch\u00f6n ist wie du)\" in 2003.\n\nKnown for his soulful voice and his [[Christianity|Christian]] lyrics, he has collaborated with several famous artists such as [[Deborah Cox]] and [[Switzerland|Swiss]] artist Stress. Naidoo was with [[S\u00f6hne Mannheims]] (Sons of Mannheim) earlier before he became famous, after his popularity increased he went back to the band and wanted to help them to become famous too, which worked. Nowadays he switches back and forth with doing some solo music or recording an album and going on tour with S\u00f6hne Mannheims. He joined groups like [[Brothers Keepers]] and the charity project (Signs of the Times) in the early 2013\n\nIn 2012, he also collaborated in '''Xavas''', a duo formation with [[Kool Savas]], a Turkish-German rapper in the album ''Gespaltene Pers\u00f6nlichkeit''. The two had already worked together on a number of other releases.\n\nIn 2013, Xavier released \"Eye Opener\" on the vocal collaboration album \"Features\" by [[Kris Menace]].<ref>[https://soundcloud.com/krismenace/sets/features] SoundCloud Kris Menace</ref>\n\n== Eurovision Song Contest invitation and withdrawal ==\n\nOn 19 November 2015, Naidoo was announced as the [[Germany in the Eurovision Song Contest 2016|German representative]] in the [[Eurovision Song Contest 2016]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.eurovision.tv/page/news?id=xavier_naidoo_to_represent_germany_in_stockholm|title=Xavier Naidoo to represent Germany in Stockholm|publisher=Eurovision.tv|accessdate=19 November 2015}}</ref> His entry was due to be chosen from six competing entries in a national final in February.\n\nHowever, his selection proved controversial.

As lead singer on \"Adriano\", one of Brothers Keepers' most well-known songs, he has been seen to stand with the Afro-German collective and setting the tone for their message.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\n==Discography==\n{{main|Xavier Naidoo discography}}\n{{col-begin}}\n{{col-2}}\n\n===Studio albums===\n* ''[[Seeing Is Believing (album)|Seeing Is Believing]]'' (1993)\n* ''[[Nicht von dieser Welt]]'' (1998)\n* ''[[Zwischenspiel \u2013 Alles f\u00fcr den Herrn]]'' (2002)\n* ''[[Telegramm f\u00fcr X]]'' (2005)\n* ''[[Alles kann besser werden]]'' (2009)\n* ''Mordsmusik'' (2013) <span style=\"font-size:85%;\">(as Der Xer)</span>\n* ''[[Bei meiner Seele]]'' (2013)\n* ''Tanzmusik (Xavier lebt hier nicht mehr)'' (2014) <span style=\"font-size:85%;\">(as Der Xer)</span>\n* ''[[Nicht von dieser Welt 2]]'' (2016)\n* ''[[F\u00fcr Dich (Xavier Naidoo album)|F\u00fcr Dich]]'' (2017)\n* ''Hin und weg'' (2019)\n{{col-2}}\n\n===Live albums===\n* ''Live'' (1999)\n* ''Alles Gute vor uns'' (2003)\n* ''Wettsingen in Schwetzingen - [[MTV Unplugged]]'' (2008)\n* ''Alles kann besser werden - Live in Oberhausen'' (2010)\n{{col-end}}\n\n==Filmography==\n*''Tatort - Die kleine Zeugin'' (TV, 2000)\n*''Auf Herz und Nieren'' (2001)\n\n===Musical===\n*''Human Pacific'' (1995)\n*''People'' (1998)\n\n===Television===\n*''[[The Voice of Germany]]'' (2011\u20132012, Coach) ([[ProSieben]], [[Sat.1]])\n*''[[Deutschland sucht den Superstar]]'' (2019\u2013present, Judge) ([[RTL Television|RTL]])\n\n==Awards==\n*1999: [[MTV Europe Music Award]] - \"Best German Act\"\n*2000: [[Echo (music award)|ECHO]] - \"Best National Male Artist - Rock/Pop\"\n*2002: [[Goldene Stimmgabel]]\n*2002: [[Comet]] - \"Best Act National\"\n*2002: [[MTV Europe Music Award]] - \"Best German Act\"\n*2004: Amadeus Award - \"Record of The Year\" for \"Ich kenne nichts (Das so sch\u00f6n ist wie Du)\"\n*2006: Goldene Kamera - \"Pop National\"\n*2006: [[Echo (music award)|ECHO]] - \"Best National Male Artist - Rock/Pop\"\n*2014: Das Goldene Brett vorm Kopf (\"Golden blockhead\") for the \"most astonishing pseudo-scientific rubbish\" <ref>[[ORF (broadcaster)|ORF]]: [http://wien.orf.at/news/stories/2551350/ Wissenschaftlicher Humbug gesucht] (German), 24 September 2012</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{Official website|http://www.xaviernaidoo.de/}}\n* [http://www.musiknews.de/artist/view/14168/xavier-naidoo.html Xavier Naidoo @ MusikNews]\n\n{{MTV EMA for Best German Act}}\n{{Eurovision Song Contest 2016 |state=autocollapse}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Naidoo, Xavier}}\n[[Category:1971 births]]\n[[Category:Living people]]\n[[Category:21st-century German singers]]\n[[Category:21st-century male singers]]\n[[Category:Anglo-Indian people]]\n[[Category:Echo (music award) winners]]\n[[Category:German Christians]]\n[[Category:German conspiracy theorists]]\n[[Category:German male singers]]\n[[Category:German people of Indian descent]]\n[[Category:German people of South African descent]]\n[[Category:German pop singers]]\n[[Category:German soul singers]]\n[[Category:German-language singers]]\n[[Category:Participants in the Bundesvision Song Contest]]\n[[Category:People from Mannheim]]\n[[Category:Soul singers]]\n[[Category:MTV EMA winners]]\n", "name_user": "XInolanIX", "label": "safe", "comment": "Corrections", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xavier_Naidoo"}

I'm excited about it, for the reader to be able to get a little more of a glimpse inside of my own personal story, my own journey of faith. I draw a lot of inspiration from each chapter from my own story, experiences I've had, so I think people are going to enjoy that, and then also sharing just powerful stories of people's lives and their own search for identity. I'm really excited about what people are going to find in these pages. It's not an autobiography and it's not a memoir, but it very much is a gathering of the last several years of my life and what I've been through in my personal life, what I've experienced in the stories of other people's lives. This book has created that perfect storm dwelling place for all these stories to be told, and to see how really a lot of them have a common thread of a search for identity, and a search to find out, 'Who am I? Why am I here? What makes me special? Should I believe what the world says about me?'}}\n\nWest wanted to write the book to tell all of his past mistakes and issues, while also trying to show relation to the reader.<ref>{{cite web|url = http://www1.cbn.com/music/hello-my-name-is-matthew-west-book-interview|title= Hello, My Name Is: Matthew West's \"Anti Self-Help\" Book| date = April 18, 2017|access-date = May 20, 2018|publisher = CBN}}</ref>\n \n==Music video==\nA lyric video for the song was released on March 22, 2013.<ref>{{cite web|url = https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZuJWQzjfU3o|title = Matthew West - Hello, My Name Is (Lyrics)|date = March 22, 2013|access-date = May 20, 2018|publisher = YouTube}}</ref> After asking for fans to send him requests for inspiration on his songs, West features the voice of Jordan, a man was dealing with a drug addiction.<ref>{{cite web|url = http://www.songfacts.com/detail.php?id=31017|title = Hello, My Name Is by Matthew West|date = September 21, 2012|access-date = May 20, 2018|publisher = CBN}}</ref> In the live version of the song, West explained Jordan's story:\n\n{{quote|'Hello, my name is Jordan and I am a drug addict.' That was the first sentence of this young man's story that he sent to me. He went on to tell me how for years that was how he identified himself. A two sport all star athlete in high school, Jordan received a college scholarship to run track and play football at a university in Kentucky. But during his sophomore season, Jordan broke his ankle. That is when he received his first prescription to Oxycontin. He wrote about how addiction quickly took a hold of his life and sent him spinning out of control.

for epidemics and pandemics are to contain or limit further outbreaks. Those actions will often involve tracing contacts, implementing quarantines, and isolating infectious cases. They will demand significant human resources and government staffing at all levels. As an outbreak grows, new facilities may need to be constructed to manage additional infectious cases.<ref name=NCBI>[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK525302/#pt5.ch17.sec2 \"Pandemics: Risks, Impacts, and Mitigation\"], [[National Center for Biotechnology Information]] (NCBI)</ref>\n\nNational medical organizations like the CDC focus on both containment to first keep the virus from spreading after its detection, and mitigation, to prevent it from spreading quickly beyond containment limits. The process of mitigating the COVID-19 pandemic is needed to extend its time frame by spreading out cases and isolating individuals, which slows the spread of the disease. By that means, it lowers the peak, or number of new cases, which reduces the likelihood of suddenly over-crowding doctors' offices and hospitals beyond their capacity.<ref name=cleveland>[https://www.cleveland.com/news/2020/03/mad-about-coronavirus-cancellations-heres-why-mitigating-the-curve-matters.html \"Mad about coronavirus cancellations? Here's why mitigating the curve matters\"], ''Cleveland.com'', March 12, 2020</ref>\n\nThe risk of a truly global pandemic is limited for some diseases, such as [[Ebola]], because of the slow pace of transmission or high probability of detection and containment. COVID-19 is at the other extreme, being a pathogen that has high potential to cause a severe pandemic, especially because it easily transmits between people and remains asymptomatic for a long period, thereby lengthening the time it is infectious and not detected.<ref name=NCBI/>\n\nIn general, once a pandemic has begun within a country's borders, the government must begin taking steps to curtail interactions between infected and uninfected populations. The methods used could include isolation of infected patients, quarantine, physical distancing practices, school closures, use of personal protective equipment, and [[Travel restrictions related to the 2019\u201320 coronavirus pandemic|travel restrictions]].<ref name=NCBI/>\n\nThe WHO on January 30 warned that \"all countries should be prepared for containment, including active surveillance, early detection, isolation and case management, [[contact tracing]] and prevention of onward spread\" of the virus.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Kennedy |first1=Merrit |title=WHO Declares Coronavirus Outbreak A Global Health Emergency |url=https://www.npr.org/sections/goatsandsoda/2020/01/30/798894428/who-declares-coronavirus-outbreak-a-global-health-emergency |accessdate=March 30, 2020 |work=[[NPR]] |date=January 30, 2020}}</ref> February 25 was the first day the CDC told the American public to prepare for an outbreak.<ref>Marisa Taylor ''[https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-china-cdc-exclusiv-idUSKBN21910S Exclusive: U.S. axed CDC expert job in China months before virus outbreak]'' March 22, 2020 Reuters.com</ref>\n\n====Travel and entry restrictions====\n\n{{See|Travel restrictions related to the 2019\u201320 coronavirus pandemic}}\n[[File:200318-H-NI589-120 (49679050593).jpg|thumb|US Customs and Border Protection officer checks travel documents of a pilot arriving in Virginia from an international flight]]\n\nChinese health authorities confirmed that they identified a cluster of a novel infectious coronavirus on December 31, 2019, in the city of Wuhan, officially reporting their findings on January 7, 2020.

Each major division is a factor of ten. This makes the slope of the plot the relative rate of change anywhere in the timeline, which allows comparison of data between early and later periods of the pandemic.<!--One line that is added in the Graph:Chart template, \"yScaleType=log\" makes this happen.

for epidemics and pandemics are to contain or limit further outbreaks. Those actions will often involve tracing contacts, implementing quarantines, and isolating infectious cases. They will demand significant human resources and government staffing at all levels. As an outbreak grows, new facilities may need to be constructed to manage additional infectious cases.<ref name=NCBI>[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK525302/#pt5.ch17.sec2 \"Pandemics: Risks, Impacts, and Mitigation\"], [[National Center for Biotechnology Information]] (NCBI)</ref>\n\nNational medical organizations like the CDC focus on both containment to first keep the virus from spreading after its detection, and mitigation, to prevent it from spreading quickly beyond containment limits. The process of mitigating the COVID-19 pandemic is needed to extend its time frame by spreading out cases and isolating individuals, which slows the spread of the disease. By that means, it lowers the peak, or number of new cases, which reduces the likelihood of suddenly over-crowding doctors' offices and hospitals beyond their capacity.<ref name=cleveland>[https://www.cleveland.com/news/2020/03/mad-about-coronavirus-cancellations-heres-why-mitigating-the-curve-matters.html \"Mad about coronavirus cancellations? Here's why mitigating the curve matters\"], ''Cleveland.com'', March 12, 2020</ref>\n\nThe risk of a truly global pandemic is limited for some diseases, such as [[Ebola]], because of the slow pace of transmission or high probability of detection and containment. COVID-19 is at the other extreme, being a pathogen that has high potential to cause a severe pandemic, especially because it easily transmits between people and remains asymptomatic for a long period, thereby lengthening the time it is infectious and not detected.<ref name=NCBI/>\n\nIn general, once a pandemic has begun within a country's borders, the government must begin taking steps to curtail interactions between infected and uninfected populations. The methods used could include isolation of infected patients, quarantine, physical distancing practices, school closures, use of personal protective equipment, and [[Travel restrictions related to the 2019\u201320 coronavirus pandemic|travel restrictions]].<ref name=NCBI/>\n\nThe WHO on January 30 warned that \"all countries should be prepared for containment, including active surveillance, early detection, isolation and case management, [[contact tracing]] and prevention of onward spread\" of the virus.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Kennedy |first1=Merrit |title=WHO Declares Coronavirus Outbreak A Global Health Emergency |url=https://www.npr.org/sections/goatsandsoda/2020/01/30/798894428/who-declares-coronavirus-outbreak-a-global-health-emergency |accessdate=March 30, 2020 |work=[[NPR]] |date=January 30, 2020}}</ref> February 25 was the first day the CDC told the American public to prepare for an outbreak.<ref>Marisa Taylor ''[https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-china-cdc-exclusiv-idUSKBN21910S Exclusive: U.S. axed CDC expert job in China months before virus outbreak]'' March 22, 2020 Reuters.com</ref>\n\n====Travel and entry restrictions====\n\n{{See|Travel restrictions related to the 2019\u201320 coronavirus pandemic}}\n[[File:200318-H-NI589-120 (49679050593).jpg|thumb|US Customs and Border Protection officer checks travel documents of a pilot arriving in Virginia from an international flight]]\n\nChinese health authorities confirmed that they identified a cluster of a novel infectious coronavirus on December 31, 2019, in the city of Wuhan, officially reporting their findings on January 7, 2020.

Each major division is a factor of ten. This makes the slope of the plot the relative rate of change anywhere in the timeline, which allows comparison of data between early and later periods of the pandemic.<!--One line that is added in the Graph:Chart template, \"yScaleType=log\" makes this happen.

Maine is the [[List of U.S. states and territories by area|12th smallest by area]], the [[List of U.S. states and territories by population|9th least populous]], and the [[List of U.S. states by population density|13th least densely populated]] of the [[List of states and territories of the United States|50 U.S. states]]. Located in [[New England]], it is bordered by [[New Hampshire]] to the west, the [[Atlantic Ocean]] to the southeast, and the [[Provinces and territories of Canada|Canadian provinces]] of [[New Brunswick]] and [[Qu\u00e9bec]] to the northeast and northwest, respectively. Maine is the only state to border exactly one other state, is the easternmost among the [[contiguous United States]], and is the northernmost state east of the [[Great Lakes]].\n\nMaine is known for its jagged, rocky coastline; low, rolling mountains; heavily forested interior; and picturesque waterways, as well as its seafood cuisine, especially [[American lobster|lobster]] and [[clam]]s. There is a [[humid continental climate]] throughout most of the state, including coastal areas.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.weatherbase.com/weather/weather-summary.php3?s=60627&cityname=Portland%2C+Maine%2C+United+States+of+America&units=|title=Portland, Maine Climate Summary|publisher=Weatherbase|accessdate=December 29, 2014}}</ref> Maine's most populous city is [[Portland, Maine|Portland]] and its capital is [[Augusta, Maine|Augusta]].\n\nFor thousands of years, [[Native Americans in the United States|indigenous peoples]] were the only inhabitants of the territory that is now Maine. At the time of European arrival in what is now Maine, several [[Algonquian languages|Algonquian]]-speaking peoples inhabited the area. The first European settlement in the area was by the French in 1604 on [[Saint Croix Island, Maine|Saint Croix Island]], by [[Pierre Dugua, Sieur de Mons]]. The first English settlement was the short-lived [[Popham Colony]], established by the [[Plymouth Company]] in 1607. A number of English settlements were established along the coast of Maine in the 1620s, although the rugged climate, deprivations, and conflict with the local peoples caused many to fail over the years.\n\nAs Maine entered the 18th century, only a half dozen European settlements had survived. [[Loyalist (American Revolution)|Loyalist]] and [[Patriot (American Revolution)|Patriot]] forces contended for Maine's territory during the [[American Revolution]]. During the [[War of 1812]], the largely-undefended eastern region of Maine was occupied by British forces, but returned to the United States following failed British offensives on the northern border, mid-Atlantic and south which produced a peace treaty that was to include dedicated land on the Michigan peninsula for Native American peoples. Maine was part of the [[Commonwealth of Massachusetts]] until 1820, when it voted to secede from Massachusetts to become a separate state. On March 15, 1820, under the [[Missouri Compromise]], it was [[Admission to the Union|admitted to the Union]] as the 23rd state.\n\n{{TOC limit|3}}\n\n==Toponymy==\n\nThere is no definitive explanation for the origin of the name \"Maine\", but the most likely origin is that the name was given by early explorers after the former [[Maine (province)|province of Maine]] in [[France]].

Long-standing disagreements over land speculation and settlements led to Maine residents and their allies in Massachusetts proper forcing an 1807 vote in the Massachusetts Assembly on permitting Maine to secede; the vote failed. Secessionist sentiment in Maine was stoked during the [[War of 1812]] when Massachusetts pro-British merchants opposed the war and refused to defend Maine from British invaders. In 1819, Massachusetts agreed to permit secession, sanctioned by voters of the rapidly growing region the following year. Formal secession and formation of the state of Maine as the 23rd state occurred on March 15, 1820, as part of the [[Missouri Compromise]], which geographically limited the spread of [[slavery]] and enabled the admission to statehood of [[Missouri]] the following year, keeping a balance between [[slave state|slave]] and free states.<ref>Woodard, Colin. \"Parallel 44: Origins of the Mass Effect\", ''The Working Waterfront'', August 31, 2010.

Maine is the only state to border exactly one other American state ([[New Hampshire]]).\n\nMaine is the easternmost state in the United States both in its extreme points and in its geographic center. The town of [[Lubec, Maine|Lubec]] is the easternmost organized settlement in the United States. Its Quoddy Head Lighthouse is also the closest place in the United States to Africa and Europe.

Along the famous rock-bound coast of Maine are lighthouses, beaches, fishing villages, and thousands of offshore islands, including the [[Isles of Shoals]] which straddle the New Hampshire border. There are jagged rocks and cliffs and many bays and inlets. Inland are lakes, rivers, forests, and mountains. This visual contrast of forested slopes sweeping down to the sea has been summed up by American poet [[Edna St. Vincent Millay]] of [[Rockland, Maine|Rockland]] and [[Camden, Maine|Camden]], Maine, in \"Renascence\":\n[[File:A beach in maine on a clear day.jpg|thumb|upright=1.15|The coast of Maine near [[Acadia National Park]]]]\n[[File:Boothbay Harbor, summer morning at low tide.jpg|thumb|upright=1.15|[[Boothbay Harbor, Maine|Boothbay Harbor]]]]\n\n:All I could see from where I stood\n:Was three long mountains and a wood;\n:I turned and looked the other way,\n:And saw three islands in a bay.\n\nGeologists describe this type of landscape as a \"drowned coast\", where a rising sea level has invaded former land features, creating bays out of valleys and islands out of mountain tops.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.answers.com/topic/drowned-coast?cat=technology|title=Answers\u2014The Most Trusted Place for Answering Life's Questions|author=|date=|website=Answers.com|accessdate=September 11, 2015}}</ref> A rise in the elevation of the land due to the melting of heavy glacier ice caused a slight rebounding effect of underlying rock; this land rise, however, was not enough to eliminate all the effect of the rising sea level and its invasion of former land features.\n\nMuch of Maine's geomorphology was created by extended glacial activity at the end of the [[Quaternary glaciation|last ice age]]. Prominent glacial features include [[Somes Sound]] and Bubble Rock, both part of Acadia National Park on Mount Desert Island. Carved by glaciers, Somes Sound is considered to be the only [[fjord]] on the eastern seaboard and reaches depths of {{convert|175|ft|m|-1}}. The extreme depth and steep drop-off allow large ships to navigate almost the entire length of the sound. These features also have made it attractive for boat builders, such as the prestigious [[Hinckley Yachts]].\n\nBubble Rock, a [[glacial erratic]], is a large boulder perched on the edge of Bubble Mountain in [[Acadia National Park]]. By analyzing the type of granite, geologists were able to discover that glaciers carried Bubble Rock to its present location from near [[Lucerne, Maine|Lucerne]], {{convert|30|mi|km}} away. The [[Iapetus Suture]] runs through the north and west of the state, being underlain by the ancient [[Laurentia|Laurentian terrane]], and the south and east underlain by the [[Avalonia|Avalonian terrane]].\n\nAcadia National Park is the only national park in New England.

Most of them are of [[French Canadian American|Canadian]] origin, but in some cases have been living there since prior to the [[American Revolutionary War]]. There are particularly high concentrations in the northern part of Maine in [[Aroostook County, Maine|Aroostook County]], which is part of a cultural region known as [[Acadia]] that goes over the border into [[New Brunswick]]. Along with the [[Acadians|Acadian]] population in the north, many French came from [[Quebec]] as immigrants between 1840 and 1930.\n\nThe upper [[Saint John River (Bay of Fundy)|Saint John River]] valley area was once part of the so-called [[Republic of Madawaska]], before the frontier was decided in the [[Webster-Ashburton Treaty]] of 1842. Over a quarter of the population of Lewiston, [[Waterville, Maine|Waterville]], and [[Biddeford]] are Franco-American. Most of the residents of the [[Mid Coast]] and [[Down East]] sections are chiefly of British heritage. Smaller numbers of various other groups, including [[Irish American|Irish]], [[Italian American|Italian]] and [[Polish American|Polish]], have settled throughout the state since the late 19th and early 20th century [[immigration]] waves.\n\n;Birth data\n''Note: Births in table don't add up, because Hispanics are counted both by their ethnicity and by their race, giving a higher overall number.''\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size: 90%;\"\n|+Live births by single race/ethnicity of mother\n|-\n!

Aroostook County is known for its [[potato]] crops. [[Commercial fishing]], once a mainstay of the state's economy, maintains a presence, particularly [[lobster fishing|lobstering]] and [[groundfishing]]. While lobster is the main seafood focus for Maine, the harvest of both oysters and seaweed are on the rise. In 2015, 14% of the Northeast's total oyster supply came from Maine. In 2017, the production of Maine's seaweed industry was estimated at $20 million per year. The shrimp industry of Maine is on a government-mandated hold. With an ever-decreasing Northern shrimp population, Maine fishermen are no longer allowed to catch and sell shrimp. The hold began in 2014 and is expected to continue until 2021.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Losneck|first=Caroline|date=April 2019|title=\"NORTHEAST: Oyster, seaweed industries continue rise in Maine; Northern shrimp shutdown extends 3 years; scup and squid try to find strong markets.\"|url=|journal=National Fisherman|volume=|pages=|via=UMA Library}}</ref> Western Maine aquifers and springs are a major source of bottled water.\n\nMaine's industrial outputs consist chiefly of paper, lumber and wood products, electronic equipment, leather products, food products, textiles, and bio-technology. Naval shipbuilding and construction remain key as well, with [[Bath Iron Works]] in Bath and [[Portsmouth Naval Shipyard]] in Kittery.\n\nBrunswick Landing, formerly [[Naval Air Station Brunswick]], is also in Maine. Formerly a large support base for the U.S. Navy, the [[Base Realignment and Closure|BRAC]] campaign initiated the Naval Air Station's closing, despite a government-funded effort to upgrade its facilities. The former base has since been changed into a civilian business park, as well as a new satellite campus for [[Southern Maine Community College]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://mrra.us/brunswick-landing/|title=Brunswick Landing\u2014Midcoast Regional Redevelopment Authority|author=|date=|website=Midcoast Regional Redevelopment Authority|accessdate=September 11, 2015}}</ref>\n\nMaine is the number one U.S. producer of low-bush [[blueberry|blueberries]] ([[Vaccinium angustifolium]]). Preliminary data from the [[USDA]] for 2012 also indicate Maine was the largest blueberry producer of the major blueberry producing states, with 91,100,000 lbs.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://usda.mannlib.cornell.edu/usda/ers/blueberry/table02.xls|title=Data|website=usda.mannlib.cornell.edu}}</ref> This data includes both low (wild), and high-bush (cultivated) blueberries: [[Vaccinium corymbosum]]. The largest toothpick manufacturing plant in the United States used to be located in [[Strong, Maine]]. The Strong Wood Products plant produced 20 million toothpicks a day. It closed in May 2003.\n\nTourism and outdoor recreation play a major and increasingly important role in Maine's economy. The state is a popular destination for sport [[hunting]] (particularly deer, moose and bear), [[sport fishing]], [[snowmobile|snowmobiling]], [[skiing]], boating, [[camping]] and [[hiking]], among other activities.\n\nHistorically, Maine ports played a key role in national transportation. Beginning around 1880, Portland's rail link and [[ice-free port]] made it Canada's principal winter port, until the aggressive development of [[Halifax Regional Municipality, Nova Scotia|Halifax]], Nova Scotia, in the mid-1900s. In 2013, 12,039,600 [[short tons]] passed into and out of Portland by sea,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.navigationdatacenter.us/wcsc/webpub13/Part1_Ports_tonsbycommCY2013.htm|title=Part1_Ports_tonsbycommCY2013.htm|website=www.navigationdatacenter.us}}</ref> which places it 45th of U.S. water ports.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rita.dot.gov/bts/sites/rita.dot.gov.bts/files/publications/national_transportation_statistics/html/table_01_57.html|title=Table 1-57: Tonnage of Top 50 U.S. Water Ports, Ranked by Total Tons(a)\u2014Bureau of Transportation Statistics|website=www.rita.dot.gov}}</ref> Portland Maine's [[Portland International Jetport]] was recently expanded, providing the state with increased air traffic from carriers such as [[JetBlue]] and [[Southwest Airlines]].\n\nMaine has very few large companies that maintain headquarters in the state, and that number has fallen due to consolidations and mergers, particularly in the [[pulp and paper industry]]. Some of the larger companies that do maintain headquarters in Maine include [[Fairchild Semiconductor]] in South Portland; [[IDEXX Laboratories]], in Westbrook; [[Hannaford Bros. Co.]] in Scarborough; [[TD Banknorth|TD Bank]] in Portland; [[L.L.Bean]] in Freeport; and [[Cole Haan]] in Yarmouth. Maine is also the home of the [[Jackson Laboratory]], the world's largest non-profit mammalian genetic research facility and the world's largest supplier of genetically purebred mice.\n\n===Taxation===\n\n{{further|State tax levels in the United States}}\n\nMaine has an [[income tax]] structure containing two brackets, 6.5 and 7.95 percent of personal income.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://maine.gov/revenue/forms/1040/2013/1040RateSched_13RevJan13.pdf |title=Tax forms|website=maine.gov}}</ref> Before July 2013 Maine had four brackets: 2, 4.5, 7, and 8.5 percent.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://maine.gov/revenue/forms/1040/2012/RateSched_12.pdf |title=Tax forms|website=maine.gov}}</ref> Maine's general [[sales tax]] rate is 5.5 percent.

All [[Real property|real]] and tangible [[personal property]] located in the state of Maine is taxable unless specifically exempted by statute. The administration of property taxes is handled by the local assessor in incorporated cities and towns, while property taxes in the unorganized territories are handled by the State Tax Assessor.\n\n===Shipbuilding===\n\n{{Further|Bath Iron Works|Portsmouth Naval Shipyard}}\n\nMaine has a long-standing tradition of being home to many shipbuilding companies. In the 18th and 19th centuries, Maine was home to many shipyards that produced wooden sailing ships. The main function of these ships was to transport either cargos or passengers overseas. One of these yards was located in [[Pennellville Historic District]] in what is now Brunswick, Maine. This yard, owned by the Pennell family, was typical of the many family-owned shipbuilding companies of the time period. Other such examples of shipbuilding families were the Skolfields and the Morses. During the 18th and 19th centuries, wooden shipbuilding of this sort made up a sizable portion of the economy.\n\n==Transportation==\n===Airports===\n\n[[File:KPWM Aerial Wiki.jpg|thumb|upright=1.15|[[Portland International Jetport]]]]\n\nMaine receives [[Jet airliner|passenger jet]] service at its two largest airports, the [[Portland International Jetport]] in Portland, and the [[Bangor International Airport]] in Bangor. Both are served daily by many major [[airline]]s to destinations such as New York, [[Atlanta]], and [[Orlando, Florida|Orlando]]. [[Essential Air Service]] also subsidizes service to a number of smaller airports in Maine, bringing small [[turboprop]] aircraft to regional airports such as the [[Augusta State Airport]], [[Hancock County-Bar Harbor Airport]], [[Knox County Regional Airport]], and the [[Northern Maine Regional Airport at Presque Isle]]. These airports are served by regional providers such as [[Cape Air]] with Cessna 402s, [[PenAir]] with Saab 340s, and [[CommutAir]] with Embraer ERJ 145 aircraft.\n\nMany smaller airports are scattered throughout Maine, serving only [[general aviation]] traffic. The [[Eastport Municipal Airport]], for example, is a city-owned public-use airport with 1,200 general aviation aircraft operations each year from single-engine and ultralight aircraft.<ref>KEPM\u2014Eastport, Maine\u2014Eastport Municipal Airport\".

The state of Maine also has three Constitutional Officers (the Secretary of State, the State Treasurer, and the State Attorney General) and one Statutory Officer (the State Auditor).\n\nThe [[legislative branch]] is the [[Maine Legislature]], a bicameral body composed of the [[Maine House of Representatives]], with 151 members, and the [[Maine Senate]], with 35 members. The Legislature is charged with introducing and passing laws.\n\nThe [[executive branch]] is responsible for the execution of the laws created by the Legislature and is headed by the [[Governor of Maine]] (currently [[Janet Mills]]). The Governor is elected every four years; no individual may serve more than two consecutive terms in this office. The current [[attorney general of Maine]] is [[Aaron Frey]]. As with other [[State legislature (United States)|state legislatures]], the Maine Legislature can by a two-thirds majority vote from both the House and Senate override a gubernatorial veto. Maine is one of seven states that do not have a lieutenant governor.\n\nThe [[judicial branch]] is responsible for interpreting state laws. The highest court of the state is the [[Maine Supreme Judicial Court]]. The lower courts are the District Court, [[Maine Superior Court|Superior Court]] and Probate Court. All judges except for probate judges serve full-time, are nominated by the Governor and confirmed by the Legislature for terms of seven years. Probate judges serve part-time and are elected by the voters of each county for four-year terms.\n\n===Counties===\n\n{{See also|List of counties in Maine}}\n\nMaine is divided into political jurisdictions designated as [[County (United States)|counties]].

Maine has had two independent governors recently ([[James B. Longley]], 1975\u20131979 and current U.S. Senator [[Angus King]], 1995\u20132003). Maine state politicians, Democrats and Republicans alike, are noted for having more moderate views than many in the national wings of their respective parties.\n\nMaine is an [[alcoholic beverage control state]].\n\nOn May 6, 2009, Maine became the fifth state to legalize [[Same-sex marriage in Maine|same-sex marriage]]; however, the law was repealed by voters on November 3, 2009. On November 6, 2012, Maine, along with Maryland and Washington, became the first state to legalize same-sex marriage at the ballot box.<ref>\"[https://huffingtonpost.com/2012/11/07/maine-gay-marriage-question-1-results_n_2050863.html Maine Passes Gay Marriage in Historic 'Question 1' Vote]\". ''[[The Huffington Post]]''. November 7, 2012.</ref>\n\n===Federal politics===\n\nIn the 1930s, Maine was one of very few states which retained [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] sentiments. In the [[1936 United States presidential election|1936 presidential election]], [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] received the [[Electoral College (United States)|electoral votes]] of every state other than Maine and [[Vermont]]; these were the only two states in the nation that never voted for Roosevelt in any of his presidential campaigns, though Maine was closely fought in [[1940 United States presidential election|1940]] and [[1944 United States presidential election|1944]]. In the 1960s, Maine began to lean toward the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrats]], especially in [[President of the United States|presidential]] elections. In [[1968 United States presidential election|1968]], [[Hubert Humphrey]] became just the second Democrat in half a century to carry Maine, perhaps because of the presence of his running mate, Maine Senator [[Edmund Muskie]], although the state voted Republican in every presidential election in the 1970s and 1980s.\n[[File:United States presidential election in Maine, 2016.svg|thumb|left|[[Treemap]] of the popular vote by county, 2016 presidential election]]\n\nSince 1969, two of Maine's four electoral votes have been awarded based on the winner of the statewide election; the other two go to the highest vote-getter in each of the state's two congressional districts. Every other state except [[Nebraska]] gives all its electoral votes to the candidate who wins the popular vote in the state at large, without regard to performance within districts. Maine split its electoral vote for the first time in 2016, with Donald Trump's strong showing in the more rural central and northern Maine allowing him to capture one of the state's four votes in the Electoral College.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pressherald.com/2016/11/08/mainers-take-matters-into-their-own-hands-after-bitter-presidential-campaign/|title=Trump takes 1 of Maine's 4 electoral votes, in a first for the state|date=November 8, 2016|publisher=}}</ref>\n\n[[Ross Perot]] achieved a great deal of success in Maine in the presidential elections of [[1992 United States presidential election|1992]] and [[1996 United States presidential election|1996]]. In 1992, as an [[Independent (politician)|independent candidate]], Perot came in second to Democrat [[Bill Clinton]], despite the long-time presence of the [[Bush family]] summer home in [[Kennebunkport, Maine|Kennebunkport]]. In 1996, as the nominee of the [[Reform Party (United States)|Reform Party]], Perot did better in Maine than in any other state.\n\nMaine has voted for Democratic Bill Clinton twice, [[Al Gore]] in [[2000 United States presidential election|2000]], [[John Kerry]] in [[2004 United States presidential election|2004]], and [[Barack Obama]] in [[2008 United States presidential election|2008]] and [[2012 United States presidential election|2012]]. In [[2016 United States presidential election|2016]], Republican [[Donald Trump]] won one of Maine's electoral votes with Democratic opponent [[Hillary Clinton]] winning the other three. Although Democrats have mostly carried the state in presidential elections in recent years, Republicans have largely maintained their control of the state's [[United States Senate|U.S. Senate]] seats, with Edmund Muskie, [[William Hathaway]] and [[George J. Mitchell]] being the only Maine Democrats serving in the U.S. Senate in the past fifty years.\n\nIn the 2010 midterm elections, Republicans made major gains in Maine. They captured the governor's office as well as majorities in both chambers of the state legislature for the first time since the early 1970s. However, in the 2012 elections Democrats managed to recapture both houses of [[Maine Legislature]].\n\nMaine's U.S. senators are Republican [[Susan Collins]] and [[Independent (politics)|Independent]] Angus King. The governor is Democrat [[Janet Mills]]. The state's two members of the [[United States House of Representatives]] are Democrats [[Chellie Pingree]] and \n[[Jared Golden]].\n\nMaine is the first state to have introduced ranked-choice voting in federal elections.<ref name=\"New York Times\">{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/12/03/us/maine-ranked-choice-voting.html|title = Maine Adopts Ranked-Choice Voting.

The governmental format of most organized towns and [[Plantation (Maine)|plantations]] is the town meeting, while the format of most cities is the council-manager form. {{as of|2013}} the organized municipalities of Maine consist of 23 [[List of cities in Maine|cities]], 431 [[List of towns in Maine|towns]], and 34 [[List of plantations in Maine|plantations]]. Collectively these 488 organized municipalities cover less than half of the state's territory. Maine also has three Reservations: [[Penobscot Indian Island Reservation|Indian Island]], Indian Township Reservation, and Pleasant Point Indian Reservation.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.maine.gov/local/|title=Maine.gov: Local|author=|date=|website=maine.gov|accessdate=September 11, 2015}}</ref>\n* The largest municipality in Maine, by population, is the city of Portland (pop. 66,318).\n* The smallest city by population is Eastport (pop. 1,331).\n* The largest town by population is Brunswick (pop. 20,278).\n* The smallest town by population is [[Frye Island, Maine|Frye Island]], a resort town which reported zero year-round population in the 2000 Census; one plantation, [[Glenwood Plantation, Maine|Glenwood Plantation]], also reported a permanent population of zero.\n* In the 2000 census, the smallest town aside from Frye Island was [[Centerville, Maine|Centerville]] with a population of 26, but since that census, Centerville voted to disincorporate and therefore is no longer a town. The next smallest town with a population listed in that census is [[Beddington, Maine|Beddington]] (pop. 50 at the 2010 census).\n* The largest municipality by land area is the town of [[Allagash, Maine|Allagash]], at {{convert|128|sqmi|km2|0}}.\n* The smallest municipality by land area is [[Monhegan, Maine|Monhegan Island]], at {{convert|0.86|sqmi|km2|sigfig=2}}. The smallest municipality by area that is not an island is [[Randolph, Maine|Randolph]], at {{convert|2.23|sqmi|km2|0}}.\n\n===Unorganized territory===\n\n[[Unorganized territory]] (UT) has no local government. Administration, services, licensing, and ordinances are handled by the state government as well as by respective county governments who have townships within each county's bounds. The unorganized territory of Maine consists of more than 400 townships (towns are incorporated, townships are unincorporated), plus many coastal islands that do not lie within any municipal bounds. The UT land area is slightly over half the entire area of the State of Maine. Year-round residents in the UT number approximately 9,000 (about 1.3% of the state's total population), with many more people staying there only seasonally.

Maine is the [[List of U.S. states and territories by area|12th smallest by area]], the [[List of U.S. states and territories by population|9th least populous]], and the [[List of U.S. states by population density|13th least densely populated]] of the [[List of states and territories of the United States|50 U.S. states]]. Located in [[New England]], it is bordered by [[New Hampshire]] to the west, the [[Atlantic Ocean]] to the southeast, and the [[Provinces and territories of Canada|Canadian provinces]] of [[New Brunswick]] and [[Qu\u00e9bec]] to the northeast and northwest, respectively. Maine is the only state to border exactly one other state, is the easternmost among the [[contiguous United States]], and is the northernmost state east of the [[Great Lakes]].\n\nMaine is known for its jagged, rocky coastline; low, rolling mountains; heavily forested interior; and picturesque waterways, as well as its seafood cuisine, especially [[American lobster|lobster]] and [[clam]]s. There is a [[humid continental climate]] throughout most of the state, including coastal areas.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.weatherbase.com/weather/weather-summary.php3?s=60627&cityname=Portland%2C+Maine%2C+United+States+of+America&units=|title=Portland, Maine Climate Summary|publisher=Weatherbase|accessdate=December 29, 2014}}</ref> Maine's most populous city is [[Portland, Maine|Portland]] and its capital is [[Augusta, Maine|Augusta]].\n\nFor thousands of years, [[Native Americans in the United States|indigenous peoples]] were the only inhabitants of the territory that is now Maine. At the time of European arrival in what is now Maine, several [[Algonquian languages|Algonquian]]-speaking peoples inhabited the area. The first European settlement in the area was by the French in 1604 on [[Saint Croix Island, Maine|Saint Croix Island]], by [[Pierre Dugua, Sieur de Mons]]. The first English settlement was the short-lived [[Popham Colony]], established by the [[Plymouth Company]] in 1607. A number of English settlements were established along the coast of Maine in the 1620s, although the rugged climate, deprivations, and conflict with the local peoples caused many to fail over the years.\n\nAs Maine entered the 18th century, only a half dozen European settlements had survived. [[Loyalist (American Revolution)|Loyalist]] and [[Patriot (American Revolution)|Patriot]] forces contended for Maine's territory during the [[American Revolution]]. During the [[War of 1812]], the largely-undefended eastern region of Maine was occupied by British forces, but returned to the United States following failed British offensives on the northern border, mid-Atlantic and south which produced a peace treaty that was to include dedicated land on the Michigan peninsula for Native American peoples. Maine was part of the [[Commonwealth of Massachusetts]] until 1820, when it voted to secede from Massachusetts to become a separate state. On March 15, 1820, under the [[Missouri Compromise]], it was [[Admission to the Union|admitted to the Union]] as the 23rd state.\n\n{{TOC limit|3}}\n\n==Toponymy==\n\nThere is no definitive explanation for the origin of the name \"Maine\", but the most likely origin is that the name was given by early explorers after the former [[Maine (province)|province of Maine]] in [[France]]. Whatever the origin, the name was fixed for English settlers in 1665 when the English King's Commissioners ordered that the \"Province of Maine\" be entered from then on in official records.<ref name=Stewart /> The state legislature in 2001 adopted a resolution establishing Franco-American Day, which stated that the state was named after the former French province of Maine.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.mainelegislature.org/legis/bills/bills_123rd/billpdfs/HP162901.pdf |format=doc |accessdate=September 20, 2007 |title=Journal of the Senate |publisher=State of Maine, HP1629, item 1, 123rd Maine State Legislature |date=March 6, 2002 |quote=\"WHEREAS, the State of Maine is named after the Province of Maine in France{{nbsp}}...\"\n}}</ref>\n\nOther theories mention earlier places with similar names, or claim it is a [[Navigation|nautical]] reference to the mainland.<ref>{{cite web |first=Emily A. |last=Schroeder |url=http://www.maine.gov/msl/services/reference/meorigin.htm |accessdate=September 20, 2007 |title=Origin of Maine's Name |publisher=Maine State Library |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070716005630/http://www.maine.gov/msl/services/reference/meorigin.htm |archivedate=July 16, 2007 |url-status=dead |df=mdy}}</ref> Captain John Smith, in his \"Description of New England\" (1614)<ref name=\"Smith1898\">{{cite book|author=John Smith|title=A Description of New England: Or, The Observations and Discoveries of Captain John Smith, (admiral of that Country), in the North of America, in the Year of Our Lord 1614, with the Success of Six Ships that Went the Next Year, 1615; with the Proof of the Present Benefit this Country Affords|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mxUOAAAAIAAJ|year=1898|publisher=G.

Long-standing disagreements over land speculation and settlements led to Maine residents and their allies in Massachusetts proper forcing an 1807 vote in the Massachusetts Assembly on permitting Maine to secede; the vote failed. Secessionist sentiment in Maine was stoked during the [[War of 1812]] when Massachusetts pro-British merchants opposed the war and refused to defend Maine from British invaders. In 1819, Massachusetts agreed to permit secession, sanctioned by voters of the rapidly growing region the following year. Formal secession and formation of the state of Maine as the 23rd state occurred on March 15, 1820, as part of the [[Missouri Compromise]], which geographically limited the spread of [[slavery]] and enabled the admission to statehood of [[Missouri]] the following year, keeping a balance between [[slave state|slave]] and free states.<ref>Woodard, Colin. \"Parallel 44: Origins of the Mass Effect\", ''The Working Waterfront'', August 31, 2010.

There are jagged rocks and cliffs and many bays and inlets. Inland are lakes, rivers, forests, and mountains.

Prominent glacial features include [[Somes Sound]] and Bubble Rock, both part of Acadia National Park on Mount Desert Island. Carved by glaciers, Somes Sound is considered to be the only [[fjord]] on the eastern seaboard and reaches depths of {{convert|175|ft|m|-1}}. The extreme depth and steep drop-off allow large ships to navigate almost the entire length of the sound. These features also have made it attractive for boat builders, such as the prestigious [[Hinckley Yachts]].\n\nBubble Rock, a [[glacial erratic]], is a large boulder perched on the edge of Bubble Mountain in [[Acadia National Park]].

Most of them are of [[French Canadian American|Canadian]] origin, but in some cases have been living there since prior to the [[American Revolutionary War]]. There are particularly high concentrations in the northern part of Maine in [[Aroostook County, Maine|Aroostook County]], which is part of a cultural region known as [[Acadia]] that goes over the border into [[New Brunswick]]. Along with the [[Acadians|Acadian]] population in the north, many French came from [[Quebec]] as immigrants between 1840 and 1930.\n\nThe upper [[Saint John River (Bay of Fundy)|Saint John River]] valley area was once part of the so-called [[Republic of Madawaska]], before the frontier was decided in the [[Webster-Ashburton Treaty]] of 1842. Over a quarter of the population of Lewiston, [[Waterville, Maine|Waterville]], and [[Biddeford]] are Franco-American. Most of the residents of the [[Mid Coast]] and [[Down East]] sections are chiefly of British heritage. Smaller numbers of various other groups, including [[Irish American|Irish]], [[Italian American|Italian]] and [[Polish American|Polish]], have settled throughout the state since the late 19th and early 20th century [[immigration]] waves.\n\n;Birth data\n''Note: Births in table don't add up, because Hispanics are counted both by their ethnicity and by their race, giving a higher overall number.''\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size: 90%;\"\n|+Live births by single race/ethnicity of mother\n|-\n!

Aroostook County is known for its [[potato]] crops. [[Commercial fishing]], once a mainstay of the state's economy, maintains a presence, particularly [[lobster fishing|lobstering]] and [[groundfishing]]. While lobster is the main seafood focus for Maine, the harvest of both oysters and seaweed are on the rise. In 2015, 14% of the Northeast's total oyster supply came from Maine. In 2017, the production of Maine's seaweed industry was estimated at $20 million per year. The shrimp industry of Maine is on a government-mandated hold. With an ever-decreasing Northern shrimp population, Maine fishermen are no longer allowed to catch and sell shrimp. The hold began in 2014 and is expected to continue until 2021.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Losneck|first=Caroline|date=April 2019|title=\"NORTHEAST: Oyster, seaweed industries continue rise in Maine; Northern shrimp shutdown extends 3 years; scup and squid try to find strong markets.\"|url=|journal=National Fisherman|volume=|pages=|via=UMA Library}}</ref> Western Maine aquifers and springs are a major source of bottled water.\n\nMaine's industrial outputs consist chiefly of paper, lumber and wood products, electronic equipment, leather products, food products, textiles, and bio-technology. Naval shipbuilding and construction remain key as well, with [[Bath Iron Works]] in Bath and [[Portsmouth Naval Shipyard]] in Kittery.\n\nBrunswick Landing, formerly [[Naval Air Station Brunswick]], is also in Maine. Formerly a large support base for the U.S. Navy, the [[Base Realignment and Closure|BRAC]] campaign initiated the Naval Air Station's closing, despite a government-funded effort to upgrade its facilities. The former base has since been changed into a civilian business park, as well as a new satellite campus for [[Southern Maine Community College]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://mrra.us/brunswick-landing/|title=Brunswick Landing\u2014Midcoast Regional Redevelopment Authority|author=|date=|website=Midcoast Regional Redevelopment Authority|accessdate=September 11, 2015}}</ref>\n\nMaine is the number one U.S. producer of low-bush [[blueberry|blueberries]] ([[Vaccinium angustifolium]]). Preliminary data from the [[USDA]] for 2012 also indicate Maine was the largest blueberry producer of the major blueberry producing states, with 91,100,000 lbs.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://usda.mannlib.cornell.edu/usda/ers/blueberry/table02.xls|title=Data|website=usda.mannlib.cornell.edu}}</ref> This data includes both low (wild), and high-bush (cultivated) blueberries: [[Vaccinium corymbosum]]. The largest toothpick manufacturing plant in the United States used to be located in [[Strong, Maine]]. The Strong Wood Products plant produced 20 million toothpicks a day. It closed in May 2003.\n\nTourism and outdoor recreation play a major and increasingly important role in Maine's economy. The state is a popular destination for sport [[hunting]] (particularly deer, moose and bear), [[sport fishing]], [[snowmobile|snowmobiling]], [[skiing]], boating, [[camping]] and [[hiking]], among other activities.\n\nHistorically, Maine ports played a key role in national transportation. Beginning around 1880, Portland's rail link and [[ice-free port]] made it Canada's principal winter port, until the aggressive development of [[Halifax Regional Municipality, Nova Scotia|Halifax]], Nova Scotia, in the mid-1900s. In 2013, 12,039,600 [[short tons]] passed into and out of Portland by sea,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.navigationdatacenter.us/wcsc/webpub13/Part1_Ports_tonsbycommCY2013.htm|title=Part1_Ports_tonsbycommCY2013.htm|website=www.navigationdatacenter.us}}</ref> which places it 45th of U.S. water ports.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rita.dot.gov/bts/sites/rita.dot.gov.bts/files/publications/national_transportation_statistics/html/table_01_57.html|title=Table 1-57: Tonnage of Top 50 U.S. Water Ports, Ranked by Total Tons(a)\u2014Bureau of Transportation Statistics|website=www.rita.dot.gov}}</ref> Portland Maine's [[Portland International Jetport]] was recently expanded, providing the state with increased air traffic from carriers such as [[JetBlue]] and [[Southwest Airlines]].\n\nMaine has very few large companies that maintain headquarters in the state, and that number has fallen due to consolidations and mergers, particularly in the [[pulp and paper industry]]. Some of the larger companies that do maintain headquarters in Maine include [[Fairchild Semiconductor]] in South Portland; [[IDEXX Laboratories]], in Westbrook; [[Hannaford Bros. Co.]] in Scarborough; [[TD Banknorth|TD Bank]] in Portland; [[L.L.Bean]] in Freeport; and [[Cole Haan]] in Yarmouth. Maine is also the home of the [[Jackson Laboratory]], the world's largest non-profit mammalian genetic research facility and the world's largest supplier of genetically purebred mice.\n\n===Taxation===\n\n{{further|State tax levels in the United States}}\n\nMaine has an [[income tax]] structure containing two brackets, 6.5 and 7.95 percent of personal income.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://maine.gov/revenue/forms/1040/2013/1040RateSched_13RevJan13.pdf |title=Tax forms|website=maine.gov}}</ref> Before July 2013 Maine had four brackets: 2, 4.5, 7, and 8.5 percent.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://maine.gov/revenue/forms/1040/2012/RateSched_12.pdf |title=Tax forms|website=maine.gov}}</ref> Maine's general [[sales tax]] rate is 5.5 percent.

All [[Real property|real]] and tangible [[personal property]] located in the state of Maine is taxable unless specifically exempted by statute. The administration of property taxes is handled by the local assessor in incorporated cities and towns, while property taxes in the unorganized territories are handled by the State Tax Assessor.\n\n===Shipbuilding===\n\n{{Further|Bath Iron Works|Portsmouth Naval Shipyard}}\n\nMaine has a long-standing tradition of being home to many shipbuilding companies. In the 18th and 19th centuries, Maine was home to many shipyards that produced wooden sailing ships. The main function of these ships was to transport either cargos or passengers overseas. One of these yards was located in [[Pennellville Historic District]] in what is now Brunswick, Maine. This yard, owned by the Pennell family, was typical of the many family-owned shipbuilding companies of the time period. Other such examples of shipbuilding families were the Skolfields and the Morses. During the 18th and 19th centuries, wooden shipbuilding of this sort made up a sizable portion of the economy.\n\n==Transportation==\n===Airports===\n\n[[File:KPWM Aerial Wiki.jpg|thumb|upright=1.15|[[Portland International Jetport]]]]\n\nMaine receives [[Jet airliner|passenger jet]] service at its two largest airports, the [[Portland International Jetport]] in Portland, and the [[Bangor International Airport]] in Bangor. Both are served daily by many major [[airline]]s to destinations such as New York, [[Atlanta]], and [[Orlando, Florida|Orlando]]. [[Essential Air Service]] also subsidizes service to a number of smaller airports in Maine, bringing small [[turboprop]] aircraft to regional airports such as the [[Augusta State Airport]], [[Hancock County-Bar Harbor Airport]], [[Knox County Regional Airport]], and the [[Northern Maine Regional Airport at Presque Isle]]. These airports are served by regional providers such as [[Cape Air]] with Cessna 402s, [[PenAir]] with Saab 340s, and [[CommutAir]] with Embraer ERJ 145 aircraft.\n\nMany smaller airports are scattered throughout Maine, serving only [[general aviation]] traffic. The [[Eastport Municipal Airport]], for example, is a city-owned public-use airport with 1,200 general aviation aircraft operations each year from single-engine and ultralight aircraft.<ref>KEPM\u2014Eastport, Maine\u2014Eastport Municipal Airport\".

The state of Maine also has three Constitutional Officers (the Secretary of State, the State Treasurer, and the State Attorney General) and one Statutory Officer (the State Auditor).\n\nThe [[legislative branch]] is the [[Maine Legislature]], a bicameral body composed of the [[Maine House of Representatives]], with 151 members, and the [[Maine Senate]], with 35 members. The Legislature is charged with introducing and passing laws.\n\nThe [[executive branch]] is responsible for the execution of the laws created by the Legislature and is headed by the [[Governor of Maine]] (currently [[Janet Mills]]). The Governor is elected every four years; no individual may serve more than two consecutive terms in this office. The current [[attorney general of Maine]] is [[Aaron Frey]]. As with other [[State legislature (United States)|state legislatures]], the Maine Legislature can by a two-thirds majority vote from both the House and Senate override a gubernatorial veto. Maine is one of seven states that do not have a lieutenant governor.\n\nThe [[judicial branch]] is responsible for interpreting state laws. The highest court of the state is the [[Maine Supreme Judicial Court]]. The lower courts are the District Court, [[Maine Superior Court|Superior Court]] and Probate Court.

Maine has had two independent governors recently ([[James B. Longley]], 1975\u20131979 and current U.S. Senator [[Angus King]], 1995\u20132003). Maine state politicians, Democrats and Republicans alike, are noted for having more moderate views than many in the national wings of their respective parties.\n\nMaine is an [[alcoholic beverage control state]].\n\nOn May 6, 2009, Maine became the fifth state to legalize [[Same-sex marriage in Maine|same-sex marriage]]; however, the law was repealed by voters on November 3, 2009. On November 6, 2012, Maine, along with Maryland and Washington, became the first state to legalize same-sex marriage at the ballot box.<ref>\"[https://huffingtonpost.com/2012/11/07/maine-gay-marriage-question-1-results_n_2050863.html Maine Passes Gay Marriage in Historic 'Question 1' Vote]\". ''[[The Huffington Post]]''. November 7, 2012.</ref>\n\n===Federal politics===\n\nIn the 1930s, Maine was one of very few states which retained [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] sentiments. In the [[1936 United States presidential election|1936 presidential election]], [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] received the [[Electoral College (United States)|electoral votes]] of every state other than Maine and [[Vermont]]; these were the only two states in the nation that never voted for Roosevelt in any of his presidential campaigns, though Maine was closely fought in [[1940 United States presidential election|1940]] and [[1944 United States presidential election|1944]]. In the 1960s, Maine began to lean toward the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrats]], especially in [[President of the United States|presidential]] elections. In [[1968 United States presidential election|1968]], [[Hubert Humphrey]] became just the second Democrat in half a century to carry Maine, perhaps because of the presence of his running mate, Maine Senator [[Edmund Muskie]], although the state voted Republican in every presidential election in the 1970s and 1980s.\n[[File:United States presidential election in Maine, 2016.svg|thumb|left|[[Treemap]] of the popular vote by county, 2016 presidential election]]\n\nSince 1969, two of Maine's four electoral votes have been awarded based on the winner of the statewide election; the other two go to the highest vote-getter in each of the state's two congressional districts. Every other state except [[Nebraska]] gives all its electoral votes to the candidate who wins the popular vote in the state at large, without regard to performance within districts. Maine split its electoral vote for the first time in 2016, with Donald Trump's strong showing in the more rural central and northern Maine allowing him to capture one of the state's four votes in the Electoral College.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pressherald.com/2016/11/08/mainers-take-matters-into-their-own-hands-after-bitter-presidential-campaign/|title=Trump takes 1 of Maine's 4 electoral votes, in a first for the state|date=November 8, 2016|publisher=}}</ref>\n\n[[Ross Perot]] achieved a great deal of success in Maine in the presidential elections of [[1992 United States presidential election|1992]] and [[1996 United States presidential election|1996]]. In 1992, as an [[Independent (politician)|independent candidate]], Perot came in second to Democrat [[Bill Clinton]], despite the long-time presence of the [[Bush family]] summer home in [[Kennebunkport, Maine|Kennebunkport]]. In 1996, as the nominee of the [[Reform Party (United States)|Reform Party]], Perot did better in Maine than in any other state.\n\nMaine has voted for Democratic Bill Clinton twice, [[Al Gore]] in [[2000 United States presidential election|2000]], [[John Kerry]] in [[2004 United States presidential election|2004]], and [[Barack Obama]] in [[2008 United States presidential election|2008]] and [[2012 United States presidential election|2012]]. In [[2016 United States presidential election|2016]], Republican [[Donald Trump]] won one of Maine's electoral votes with Democratic opponent [[Hillary Clinton]] winning the other three. Although Democrats have mostly carried the state in presidential elections in recent years, Republicans have largely maintained their control of the state's [[United States Senate|U.S. Senate]] seats, with Edmund Muskie, [[William Hathaway]] and [[George J. Mitchell]] being the only Maine Democrats serving in the U.S. Senate in the past fifty years.\n\nIn the 2010 midterm elections, Republicans made major gains in Maine. They captured the governor's office as well as majorities in both chambers of the state legislature for the first time since the early 1970s. However, in the 2012 elections Democrats managed to recapture both houses of [[Maine Legislature]].\n\nMaine's U.S. senators are Republican [[Susan Collins]] and [[Independent (politics)|Independent]] Angus King. The governor is Democrat [[Janet Mills]]. The state's two members of the [[United States House of Representatives]] are Democrats [[Chellie Pingree]] and \n[[Jared Golden]].\n\nMaine is the first state to have introduced ranked-choice voting in federal elections.<ref name=\"New York Times\">{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/12/03/us/maine-ranked-choice-voting.html|title = Maine Adopts Ranked-Choice Voting.

The governmental format of most organized towns and [[Plantation (Maine)|plantations]] is the town meeting, while the format of most cities is the council-manager form. {{as of|2013}} the organized municipalities of Maine consist of 23 [[List of cities in Maine|cities]], 431 [[List of towns in Maine|towns]], and 34 [[List of plantations in Maine|plantations]]. Collectively these 488 organized municipalities cover less than half of the state's territory. Maine also has three Reservations: [[Penobscot Indian Island Reservation|Indian Island]], Indian Township Reservation, and Pleasant Point Indian Reservation.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.maine.gov/local/|title=Maine.gov: Local|author=|date=|website=maine.gov|accessdate=September 11, 2015}}</ref>\n* The largest municipality in Maine, by population, is the city of Portland (pop. 66,318).\n* The smallest city by population is Eastport (pop. 1,331).\n* The largest town by population is Brunswick (pop. 20,278).\n* The smallest town by population is [[Frye Island, Maine|Frye Island]], a resort town which reported zero year-round population in the 2000 Census; one plantation, [[Glenwood Plantation, Maine|Glenwood Plantation]], also reported a permanent population of zero.\n* In the 2000 census, the smallest town aside from Frye Island was [[Centerville, Maine|Centerville]] with a population of 26, but since that census, Centerville voted to disincorporate and therefore is no longer a town. The next smallest town with a population listed in that census is [[Beddington, Maine|Beddington]] (pop. 50 at the 2010 census).\n* The largest municipality by land area is the town of [[Allagash, Maine|Allagash]], at {{convert|128|sqmi|km2|0}}.\n* The smallest municipality by land area is [[Monhegan, Maine|Monhegan Island]], at {{convert|0.86|sqmi|km2|sigfig=2}}. The smallest municipality by area that is not an island is [[Randolph, Maine|Randolph]], at {{convert|2.23|sqmi|km2|0}}.\n\n===Unorganized territory===\n\n[[Unorganized territory]] (UT) has no local government. Administration, services, licensing, and ordinances are handled by the state government as well as by respective county governments who have townships within each county's bounds. The unorganized territory of Maine consists of more than 400 townships (towns are incorporated, townships are unincorporated), plus many coastal islands that do not lie within any municipal bounds. The UT land area is slightly over half the entire area of the State of Maine. Year-round residents in the UT number approximately 9,000 (about 1.3% of the state's total population), with many more people staying there only seasonally.
