Ward found that with a title like ''Mercenaries'' that the game's world provided more entertainment than the developers likely planned and gave him a sense of freedom in playing around with inconsequential elements of the game.

Online Stunt Run involves up to 8 players who simultaneously compete for the highest stunt score within 2 minutes. Road Rage features two teams; one must race to a checkpoint while the other tries to stop them through takedowns.  Marked Man is like a game of tag, with one player as the Marked Man who cannot see the other players and has no boost. In addition there are 70 new online challenges. These new challenges are different from Free Burn challenges, being timed. Timed challenges start once all players gather at a point of interest.

Showtime does differ from the previous incarnation of Crash Mode being that instead of crashing into a busy intersection and watching a crash play out, Showtime has you bounce the vehicle around for as long as possible to gain points.

Ward found that with a title like ''Mercenaries'' that the game's world provided more entertainment than the developers likely planned and gave him a sense of freedom in playing around with inconsequential elements of the game. He wanted to take this idea into ''Burnout Paradise''; \"My philosophy was that if me and you both played it for three hours, we\u2019d both do different things.\"<ref name=\"gamasutra retrospective\">{{cite web | url = https://www.gamasutra.com/view/news/315213/Devs_reflect_on_the_impact_and_legacy_of_Burnout_Paradise.php | title = Devs reflect on the impact and legacy of Burnout Paradise | first = Samuel | last = Horti | date = 6 March 2018 | accessdate = 6 March 2018 | work = [[Gamasutra]] | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20180306113945/https://www.gamasutra.com/view/news/315213/Devs_reflect_on_the_impact_and_legacy_of_Burnout_Paradise.php | archive-date = 6 March 2018 | url-status = live | df = dmy-all }}</ref> By focusing on discovery and exploration, the game ended up being a racing game without any defined tracks, a novel element at the time, which has since influenced several other racing game developers in their approaches.<ref name=\"gamasutra retrospective\"/> Ward also wanted to develop the game as a social platform, leading to some of its design choices for multiplayer formats.<ref name=\"gamasutra retrospective\"/>\n\nWard, in an interview in 2018, noted the difficulty he had in convincing Electronic Arts to follow his vision. The ''Burnout'' series at the time was already seen as a less lucrative property compared to the ''Need for Speed'' series by EA, and further, Ward found that EA was not amendable to the open world idea he presented.<ref name=\"gamasutra retrospective\"/> Ward took steps that he could to make ''Burnout Paradise'' a desirable game prior to its release to show his superiors that his ideas were sound, which proved out when the game sold more than one million copies within the first three months of release.<ref name=\"gamasutra retrospective\"/>\n\n===Updates===\n[[File:Burnout Paradise night bike.jpg|thumb|left|Although initially excluded, ''Paradise'' was updated to add time-of-day as well as motorcycles.]]\n''Burnout Paradise'' has undergone significant changes since its initial release.

Online Stunt Run involves up to 8 players who simultaneously compete for the highest stunt score within 2 minutes. Road Rage features two teams; one must race to a checkpoint while the other tries to stop them through takedowns.  Marked Man is like a game of tag, with one player as the Marked Man who cannot see the other players and has no boost. In addition there are 70 new online challenges. These new challenges are different from Free Burn challenges, being timed. Timed challenges start once all players gather at a point of interest. The players then must all complete an objective within a certain time, such as jumping a ramp. \"Cagney\" also brought custom soundtracks and [[1080i]] support to the PlayStation 3 version.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.criteriongames.com/article.php |title=Here's what you get with the FREE Cagney Software Update |publisher=Criteriongames.com |accessdate=1 June 2009 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090829002416/http://www.criteriongames.com/article.php |archivedate=29 August 2009  }}</ref>\n\nOn 23 April 2008 it was announced that motorbikes and night-day cycles would appear in the Bikes Pack (originally codenamed the \"Davis\" update), along with tailored locations, challenges and game modes.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.criteriongames.com/article.php?artID=145 |title=Article&nbsp;\u2014 Criterion Games announces motorbikes in Burnout Paradise! |publisher=Criterion Games |date=23 April 2008 |accessdate=1 June 2009 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090110144732/http://www.criteriongames.com/article.php?artID=145 |archivedate=10 January 2009  }}</ref> Criterion Games announced on 5 August 2008 that the update would also feature a new dynamic weather system, two starter bikes in the player's junkyard, 70 new bike-only challenges, and special \"Midnight Rides\" challenges that appear only at night.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://blog.us.playstation.com/2008/08/05/paradise-city-choppers-burnouts-bikes/|title=PlayStation.Blog&nbsp;\u2014 Paradise City Choppers, Burnout's Bikes|access-date=6 August 2008|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110523040632/http://blog.us.playstation.com/2008/08/05/paradise-city-choppers-burnouts-bikes/|archive-date=23 May 2011|url-status=live}}</ref> The Bikes pack was released on 18 September 2008 on both the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360.\n\nOn 25 September 2008 another update was made available which introduced support for the [[PlayStation 3 Trophies|PlayStation 3 trophies system]].

Psi Com broke up around 1985 and Farrell met [[Eric Avery]] through mutual friends. The two began jam sessions which would become the initial foundation for Jane's Addiction.

Jane's Addiction, prior to their first break-up, released three albums ''[[Jane's Addiction (album)|Jane's Addiction]]'', ''[[Nothing's Shocking]]'' and ''[[Ritual de lo Habitual]]''. A B-sides album from the ''Ritual'' sessions, titled ''Live and Rare'' was released in Japan. Late in 1991, Jane's Addiction broke up due to internal tensions over differing ideologies mostly centering on drug use, notably Farrell's severe addiction to heroin. Around this time, as mentioned in the SPIN Magazine (1991 Vol. 7 Num. 3) article about their \"Ritual\" tour, a rumor got around that Farrell had contracted HIV. Apparently for amusement, Farrell would tease audiences with \"news\" of his supposed health and would neither confirm nor deny its truth. \nIn 1993 Farrell and his ex-girlfriend Casey Niccoli released a film called ''[[Gift (1993 film)|Gift]]'' that featured Jane's Addiction. Gift was released by [[Warner Brothers]]. In 1997, Jane's Addiction reformed for a brief reunion tour with [[Flea (musician)|Flea]] replacing Avery on bass. The \"Relapse Tour\" was supported with the release of ''[[Kettle Whistle (album)|Kettle Whistle]]'', a rarities album featuring four new songs. {{citation needed|date=February 2014}}\n\nFarrell has sometimes been credited with changing the fortunes of the [[Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://musicians.about.com/od/musicfestivals/p/coachella.htm|title=Coachella Music Festival \u2013 Coachella \u2013 Profile of Coachella Music Festival|publisher=Musicians.about.com|date=June 22, 2013|accessdate=2013-07-13}}</ref> Following the festival's disastrous first year in 1999, the event was not held in 2000. In 2001, a decision was made to organize the festival again, but just a few months before the festival was set to occur, there was still no headlining group. Farrell, who was friends with the festival's organizers, decided to reunite Jane's Addiction for the 2001 event, which helped draw large crowds and allowed the festival to yield a profit (which was not the case in 1999). This began a Coachella tradition of reuniting at least one major artist each year.\n\nFarrell again toured with Jane's Addiction in 2001 and 2003.  In 2003, Jane's Addiction released an album, ''[[Strays (Jane's Addiction album)|Strays]]''. It quickly became one of their best selling records and was certified gold in the USA and silver in UK.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.riaa.com/goldandplatinumdata.php?table=SEARCH_RESULTS |title=Gold & Platinum Searchable Database \u2013 July 12, 2013 |publisher=RIAA |accessdate=2013-07-13 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070626051113/http://www.riaa.com/goldandplatinumdata.php?table=SEARCH_RESULTS |archivedate=June 26, 2007 |df=mdy-all }}</ref><ref>[http://www.bpi.co.uk/platinum/platinumright.asp?rq=search_plat&r_id=31076] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090218103035/http://www.bpi.co.uk/platinum/platinumright.asp?rq=search_plat&r_id=31076|date=February 18, 2009}}</ref> They toured extensively in North America and Europe, brought back [[Lollapalooza]] for the first time since 1997, as well as performing at the [[Big Day Out]] festivals in Australia and [[New Zealand]]. Internal struggles saw the band split up again in early 2004. A \"best of\" release following the breakup of this incarnation of the band was released in 2006, titled ''[[Up from the Catacombs - The Best of Jane's Addiction|Up from the Catacombs]]''.\n\nThe four original members of Jane's Addiction played their first show together in 17 years at the first United States edition of the NME Awards on April 23, 2008, and played two small shows in Los Angeles during Winter 2008. The band is the first American band to receive the \"God Like Genius\" Award. The reunited Jane's Addiction re-debuted at [[SXSW]] in 2009 and kicked off a summer tour with [[Nine Inch Nails]]. Eric Avery again left the band in late 2009, leaving Farrell, Navarro and Perkins as the remaining members of Jane's Addiction. The band with [[Dave Sitek]] on bass released ''[[The Great Escape Artist]]'' in 2011 and have continued to tour.\n\n===Porno for Pyros (1992\u20131998)===\n\nFollowing the break-up of Jane's Addiction, Farrell formed [[Porno for Pyros]] with former bandmate [[Stephen Perkins]] as well as newcomers [[Peter DiStefano]] on guitar and [[Martyn LeNoble]] on bass.

Psi Com broke up around 1985 and Farrell met [[Eric Avery]] through mutual friends. The two began jam sessions which would become the initial foundation for Jane's Addiction. It was during this period that Bernstein chose the pseudonym Perry Farrell for himself as a play on the word \"peripheral\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mtv.com/music/artist/farrell_perry/artist.jhtml|title=Perry Farrell &#124; New Music And Songs|publisher=MTV|date=March 29, 1959|accessdate=2013-07-13}}</ref>\n\n===Jane's Addiction <small>(1985\u20131991, 1997, 2001\u20132004, 2008\u2013present)</small>===\nJane's Addiction made its name in mid-1980s LA by building up a rabid fan base with legendary, high-energy shows in small LA rock clubs. Jane's Addiction, prior to their first break-up, released three albums ''[[Jane's Addiction (album)|Jane's Addiction]]'', ''[[Nothing's Shocking]]'' and ''[[Ritual de lo Habitual]]''. A B-sides album from the ''Ritual'' sessions, titled ''Live and Rare'' was released in Japan. Late in 1991, Jane's Addiction broke up due to internal tensions over differing ideologies mostly centering on drug use, notably Farrell's severe addiction to heroin. Around this time, as mentioned in the SPIN Magazine (1991 Vol. 7 Num. 3) article about their \"Ritual\" tour, a rumor got around that Farrell had contracted HIV. Apparently for amusement, Farrell would tease audiences with \"news\" of his supposed health and would neither confirm nor deny its truth. \nIn 1993 Farrell and his ex-girlfriend Casey Niccoli released a film called ''[[Gift (1993 film)|Gift]]'' that featured Jane's Addiction. Gift was released by [[Warner Brothers]]. In 1997, Jane's Addiction reformed for a brief reunion tour with [[Flea (musician)|Flea]] replacing Avery on bass. The \"Relapse Tour\" was supported with the release of ''[[Kettle Whistle (album)|Kettle Whistle]]'', a rarities album featuring four new songs. {{citation needed|date=February 2014}}\n\nFarrell has sometimes been credited with changing the fortunes of the [[Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://musicians.about.com/od/musicfestivals/p/coachella.htm|title=Coachella Music Festival \u2013 Coachella \u2013 Profile of Coachella Music Festival|publisher=Musicians.about.com|date=June 22, 2013|accessdate=2013-07-13}}</ref> Following the festival's disastrous first year in 1999, the event was not held in 2000. In 2001, a decision was made to organize the festival again, but just a few months before the festival was set to occur, there was still no headlining group. Farrell, who was friends with the festival's organizers, decided to reunite Jane's Addiction for the 2001 event, which helped draw large crowds and allowed the festival to yield a profit (which was not the case in 1999). This began a Coachella tradition of reuniting at least one major artist each year.\n\nFarrell again toured with Jane's Addiction in 2001 and 2003.  In 2003, Jane's Addiction released an album, ''[[Strays (Jane's Addiction album)|Strays]]''. It quickly became one of their best selling records and was certified gold in the USA and silver in UK.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.riaa.com/goldandplatinumdata.php?table=SEARCH_RESULTS |title=Gold & Platinum Searchable Database \u2013 July 12, 2013 |publisher=RIAA |accessdate=2013-07-13 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070626051113/http://www.riaa.com/goldandplatinumdata.php?table=SEARCH_RESULTS |archivedate=June 26, 2007 |df=mdy-all }}</ref><ref>[http://www.bpi.co.uk/platinum/platinumright.asp?rq=search_plat&r_id=31076] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090218103035/http://www.bpi.co.uk/platinum/platinumright.asp?rq=search_plat&r_id=31076|date=February 18, 2009}}</ref> They toured extensively in North America and Europe, brought back [[Lollapalooza]] for the first time since 1997, as well as performing at the [[Big Day Out]] festivals in Australia and [[New Zealand]]. Internal struggles saw the band split up again in early 2004. A \"best of\" release following the breakup of this incarnation of the band was released in 2006, titled ''[[Up from the Catacombs - The Best of Jane's Addiction|Up from the Catacombs]]''.\n\nThe four original members of Jane's Addiction played their first show together in 17 years at the first United States edition of the NME Awards on April 23, 2008, and played two small shows in Los Angeles during Winter 2008. The band is the first American band to receive the \"God Like Genius\" Award. The reunited Jane's Addiction re-debuted at [[SXSW]] in 2009 and kicked off a summer tour with [[Nine Inch Nails]]. Eric Avery again left the band in late 2009, leaving Farrell, Navarro and Perkins as the remaining members of Jane's Addiction. The band with [[Dave Sitek]] on bass released ''[[The Great Escape Artist]]'' in 2011 and have continued to tour.\n\n===Porno for Pyros (1992\u20131998)===\n\nFollowing the break-up of Jane's Addiction, Farrell formed [[Porno for Pyros]] with former bandmate [[Stephen Perkins]] as well as newcomers [[Peter DiStefano]] on guitar and [[Martyn LeNoble]] on bass.

In 2001, he released his debut solo album, ''[[Song Yet to Be Sung]]'', whose lyrics are inspired by [[Kabballah]].\n\nFarrell has released a number of solo tracks online, all of them recorded with the involvement of wife Etty Lau.

And that the environment serves the community, which means they need to make the decisions about it. In a recent controversy about a proposed dredging of an estuary, Hastie said: <blockquote>\"I believe in the sovereignty of local communities to make decisions about how they conserve and develop their environment. The Bindjareb people, the First Australians in my constituency, have long been custodians of the waterways\u2014for many generations back to the present. The Murray Mandurah community also shares this responsibility, and together we are all stewards of the beautiful Peel-Harvey Estuary, a body of water larger than Sydney Harbour, teeming with marine life and brimming with natural beauty. We, therefore, through our local governments, have sovereignty over this natural asset and should have a say about how development takes place. We're not antiprogress, but we are rightly cautious about development, as we are the ones most affected by it.\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.openaustralia.org.au/debates/?id=2019-09-11.151.1&s=speaker:10843#g151.2|title=Peel-Harvey Estuary: 11 Sep 2019: House debates (OpenAustralia.org)|website=www.openaustralia.org.au|access-date=2019-12-18}}</ref></blockquote>\n\n==Personal life==\n[[File:AH with family (KN).jpg|thumb|Ruth and Andrew Hastie with their children in Mandurah, October 2018]]\nHastie met his wife Ruth in the summer of 2007 while he was studying at [[George Washington University]].

And that the environment serves the community, which means they need to make the decisions about it. In a recent controversy about a proposed dredging of an estuary, Hastie said: <blockquote>\"I believe in the sovereignty of local communities to make decisions about how they conserve and develop their environment. The Bindjareb people, the First Australians in my constituency, have long been custodians of the waterways\u2014for many generations back to the present. The Murray Mandurah community also shares this responsibility, and together we are all stewards of the beautiful Peel-Harvey Estuary, a body of water larger than Sydney Harbour, teeming with marine life and brimming with natural beauty. We, therefore, through our local governments, have sovereignty over this natural asset and should have a say about how development takes place. We're not antiprogress, but we are rightly cautious about development, as we are the ones most affected by it.\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.openaustralia.org.au/debates/?id=2019-09-11.151.1&s=speaker:10843#g151.2|title=Peel-Harvey Estuary: 11 Sep 2019: House debates (OpenAustralia.org)|website=www.openaustralia.org.au|access-date=2019-12-18}}</ref></blockquote>\n\n==Personal life==\n[[File:AH with family (KN).jpg|thumb|Ruth and Andrew Hastie with their children in Mandurah, October 2018]]\nHastie met his wife Ruth in the summer of 2007 while he was studying at [[George Washington University]].
