While Mithila has suffered a drought for 12 years, elsewhere, [[Rama|Ram]] and his brothers are under the tutelage of Guru [[Vashista]]. Janak builds a golden plow and unearths a baby girl as he begins to plow. The baby's first cry leads to rainfall. Janak wants to find out whether or not the baby has a family. He is shocked to see the baby lift the [[Shiv Dhanush]]. Rishi [[Yagyavalkya]] suggests that Janak keeps the baby and so he names her [[Sita]].\n\nIt is shown that after eight years, Sita and her sisters are playing the act of Goddess [[Durga]], who destroyed a [[Rakshasa]]. Soon afterward, Sita comes to know about [[Gautama Maharishi]] and the curse he gave to his wife [[Ahilya (Hindu mythology)|Ahilya]]. Meanwhile, King [[Dasharatha]] is traveling to Guru [[Vashistha]]'s ashram to see his sons and gets inspired by [[Rama|Ram]]. Ram comes to his kingdom and meets his mother. Meanwhile, he comes to know that he has an elder sister called [[Shanta]].\n\nLater, it is shown that both Ram and Sita have grown up. In [[Ayodhya]], King [[Dasharatha]] conducts the [[Ashwamedha]] [[Yajna]] for the well-being of his sons and his kingdom. While traveling towards Mithila, Sita dares to stop the ceremonial horse and comforts it. After coming back, Ram tells not to kill the horse but spare its life.\n\nGuru [[Vishvamitra]] takes Ram and [[Lakshman]] from Ayodhya to destroy the demoness queen [[Tataka]]. Sita and her sisters also travel along with [[Kushadhwaja]] to see Guru Vishvamitra. They give [[Lakshman]] some food. Soon Taraka and her son [[Subahu]] are killed by Ram and Lakshman. Guru Vishvamitra tells him that he wants to take both of them to [[Mithila (ancient)|Mithila]] and seek the blessings of [[Shiv Dhanush]]. While traveling to Mithila, he sees Rishi Gautam and Ahilya's ashram and cures her curse. Gautam Rishi seeks his greatness to Ram. Meanwhile, Sita comes to know about her birth. Sita falls in love with Ram without seeing him. Ram comes to Mithila, and they meet for the first time at the [[Parvati]] temple. Soon after, [[Sita]]'s [[Swayamvar]] is announced. [[Lanka]] king [[Ravana]]'s grandfather and minister [[Malyavan]] travels to Mithila to see the greatness of the kingdom and argues with Sita. Then he informs [[Ravana]] that Tataka is killed.\n\nIn the Swayamvara, nobody can lift the [[Shiv Dhanush]] except Ram. Ram's marriage is fixed with Sita. On the other hand, Ravan is angry that he was unable to lift the Shiv Dhanush, and [[Janak]] has insulted him. So he vows to avenge the king. Afterward, Ravan comes to know that he will die because of a woman. Ravan remembers the day he tried to force himself upon a chaste woman, [[Vedavati]]. She had then cursed him that the cause of his death will be a woman. Remembering this, Ravan goes to Yamlok, the abode of [[Yama]], in the hope that if he keeps [[Yama]] under his thumb, he can elude death. However, Goddess of Death Mrityu Devi appears, and a terrible fight ensues between her and Ravan. Ravan soon gets overpowered. Ram and Sita get married along with Ram's brothers and Sita's sisters ([[Lakshman]]-[[Urmila]], [[Bharata (Ramayana)|Bharat]]-[[Mandavi]], [[Shatrughna]]-[[Shrutakirti]]).\n\nMeanwhile, in [[Lanka]], [[Mandodri]] gets worried about the death of Ravan and decides to seek help from a [[Vishnu]] devotee. Mithila bids farewell to Sita and her sisters.\n\n===Ayodhya Kand===\n\n[[Mandodari]] tells her father [[Mayasura]] that [[Ravan|Ravan's]] life is in danger, but he refuses to help. According to the series, she had left with Ravan against her parent's wishes. Her mother, however, guides her in getting the [[Amrita]]. Mandodari goes to [[Moon|Chandralok]] to get the [[Amrita]]. [[Vibhishana]] warns [[Mandodari]] that [[Ravan]] should not find out about his immortality. [[Mandodari]] succeeds to an extent in her plan of making [[Ravan]] immortal. Elsewhere Ram, Lakshman, Bharat, and Shatrughna reach [[Ayodhya]] with their brides. [[Kaushalya]], [[Kaikeyi]] ,and [[Sumitra]] welcome them. An [[Aghori]] predicts [[Manthara|Manthara's]] future and tells her that she will be thrown out of the palace. [[Ravan]] challenges the gods to stop him from conquering the world. Ravan confronts [[Surpanakha]] for marrying a demon, Vidyutjiva, who is Raavan's enemy. Meanwhile, Bharat and Shatrughan set off to meet [[Ashwapati]], their grandfather.\n\nDasharath announces Ram to be his heir to the throne. Kaushalya, Sumitra, and Lakshman are ecstatic to know that Ram will be crowned the king of [[Ayodhya]]. [[Manthara]] is determined to stop Ram from becoming the king. She reminds Kaikeyi about Dasharath's promise to Ashwapati and feeds that Dasharath is conspiring against her. [[Kaikeyi]] decides to stop Ram's coronation. Kaikeyi reminds [[Dasharath]] about the promises that he had given her. He vows to fulfill two wishes. Kaikeyi tells him to crown Bharat as the king of [[Ayodhya]] and send Ram into exile for 14 years.\n\nDasharath hesitantly agrees to crown Bharat, the king, and send Ram away. Sita urges Ram to take her along with him. [[Urmila]] supports [[Lakshman|Lakshman's]] decision of accompanying Ram. Ram leaves [[Ayodhya]] in his exile with Sita and Lakshman. Bharat and Shatrughna receive a message asking them to return to Ayodhya. A grieving [[Dasharatha]] passes away and [[Sumitra]] blames Kaikeyi for his death. Bharat asks [[Mandavi]] and [[Vashistha]] about Ram. When he learns about [[Kaikeyi|Kaikeyi's]] misdeed, he blames her for Dashrath's death. He confronts her for her actions against Ram. Bharata refuses to become the king of Ayodhya. Bharat and Janak decide to bring Ram back to Ayodhya. [[Kaikeyi]] is grateful to Janak for reminding her about her love for Ram. She requests Bharat to take her along with him to meet Ram.\n\nRam meets Bharat and is depressed on learning about Dasharath's death. Bharat requests Ram to return to Ayodhya, but he refuses. He tells Janak that he will not return because he wants to fulfill the promise he had made to Dasharath. Bharat asks Ram for his sandals. Bharat places Ram's sandals on the throne. He apologizes to Vashisht, saying he cannot take over Ram's place. Shatrughna confronts Bharata for his decision to become a tapas. Bharat assures [[Kaushalya]] that he will stay near Ayodhya. He asks Shatrughna to help him in keeping his promise to Ram to take care of Ayodhya. [[Lakshman]] tells Ram and Sita that Goddess Nidradevi has given him a boon to stay awake so that he can serve them. On Lakshman's request, Nidradevi gives his share of sleep to [[Urmila]], until he returns to Ayodhya.\n\n===Aranya Kand===\n\nRam conveys to [[Sita]] about his wish to protect the Rishis and people from the demons. They complete ten years of their vanvas. [[Sugriva]] tells [[Hanuman]] about [[Rum\u0101]]. Hanuman conveys to [[Rum\u0101]] that Sugriva loves her and wants to marry her. [[Vali (Ramayana)|Bali]] decides to get Sugriva married to [[Rum\u0101]]. Ravan decides to send [[Khara (Ramayana)|Khar]] and [[Dushan (Ramayana)|Dushan]] to take control of Dandakaranya. [[Surpanakha]] insists [[Ravan]] to let her go to [[Dandakaranya]]. Malyavan shares his plan to take over [[Kishkindha]] with [[Meghanad]]. Dundubi comes up with a plan to kill [[Vali (Ramayana)|Bali]] and Sugriva. Dundubi disguises as a buffalo and battles with [[Vali (Ramayana)|Bali]]. [[Vali (Ramayana)|Bali]] kills Dundubi. Rishi Matang curses [[Vali (Ramayana)|Bali]] for breaking his meditation. Ram kills Ravan's soldiers and saves the residents of Panchvati. Surpanakha falls in love with Ram.\n\nMayavi decides to take Bali to the Rishimukh mountain. [[Vali (Ramayana)|Bali]] follows Mayavi into a cave and asks Sugriva to wait outside until he returns. However, Sugriva is shocked at hearing [[Vali (Ramayana)|Bali]]'s screams. He closes the mouth of the cave by a big stone as he assumes that [[Vali (Ramayana)|Bali]] was killed by Mayavi. Sugriva suggests that Tara makes [[Angad]], the king of Kishkindha.\n\n[[Shurpanakha]] urges Ram to marry her, but he tells her that he is already married. Shurpanakha plans to prove herself better than [[Sita]]. Ram gets irate when Shurpanakha comes to him dressed like [[Sita]]. She attacks [[Sita]]. [[Lakshmana]] cuts Shurpanakha's nose. [[Surpanakha]] asks [[Khara (Ramayana)|Khara]] to kill Ram, [[Sita]], and Lakshman. Khara attacks Ram with his asuras. Ram kills Khara and Dushan by using his powers. Shurpanakha reaches [[Lanka]], tells everyone about the attack. Surpanakha asks [[Ravan]] to avenge her insult by Ram. Ravan decides to punish Ram for his deeds. [[Sugriva]]'s coronation ceremony begins. [[Hanuman]] crowns Sugriva as the king of [[Kishkindha]]. A furious [[Vali (Ramayana)|Bali]] returns to Kishkindha and attacks Sugriva for locking him up in the cave. Hanuman rescues Sugriva from [[Vali (Ramayana)|Bali]]. Ravan gets information about Ram and learns that Sita is Ram's weakness. He also remembers the incident at Sita's swayamvar and his oath to take revenge from Janak. Ravan decides to abduct Sita. Ravan tells Marich about Surpanakha's humiliation and seeks his help to avenge her insult. Hanuman takes Sugriva to Rishimukh mountain.\n\nMarich disguises himself as an injured golden deer to distract Ram from [[Sita]] and leads him far into the forest. [[Sita]] sees the injured golden deer and tells Ram that she wants to cure it. Ram tells Lakshman to stay with [[Sita]] while he goes to bring the deer. Meanwhile, [[Hanuman]] tells [[Sugriva]] that [[Vali (Ramayana)|Bali]] has made [[Rum\u0101]] his slave. Hanuman tells Sugriva that he will seek help from the other kings to defeat Bali. However, Ram is shocked when Marich calls out to Sita and Lakshman in his voice. Sita is worried about hearing Ram's cries. Marich apologizes to Ram for his misdeed and dies. [[Sita]] orders Lakshman to go into the jungle to look for Ram. Lakshman hesitantly agrees and draws a powerful line [[Lakshmana Rekha]] which no immoral creature could cross to protect Sita, but tells Sita not to cross it or the power would go. Lakshman leaves. [[Ravan]] disguises as a sage and tricks Sita to cross the [[Lakshmana Rekha]] line. Sita tries to run, but he ends up abducting her.\n\nOn the way to Lanka, [[Jatayu]] tries to save [[Sita]], but Ravan cuts off both his wings. [[Sita]] then throws her jewelry to the ground hoping Ram will see it as a sign. [[Sita]] tells Ravan to kill her and avenge himself. Ravan kidnaps Sita and takes her to Lanka. [[Surpanakha]] is delighted to see [[Sita]] in [[Lanka]]. Later, Ravan stops Surpanakha from attacking [[Sita]]. He tells her to keep [[Sita]] alive until he avenges her insult.\n\nRavan's mother [[Kaikesi]], tells him that he should marry [[Sita]] as she is a powerful woman instead of treating her badly. [[Sita]] finds her place in the garden of Lanka ([[Ashoka Vatika]]) and refuses Ravan's proposal saying that she is always going to love Ram and never be unfaithful to him. She decides to wait for him until her death. Meanwhile, Ram comes to know about the abduction from the bird Jatayu.\n\n===Kishkindha Kand===\n\n[[Hanuman]] meets Ram and becomes his devotee. He narrates about [[Sugriva]]'s problem and his brother Bali misbehaving with his wife, [[Rum\u0101]]. Ram challenges to kill Bali and liberate him from all his sins. He directs Sugriv to go on a duel with Bali so that he can kill him during that time. Everything happens accordingly, and Ram kills Bali. Bali regrets his mistakes and dies. Sugriva is crowned the king of [[Kishkindha]]. Bali's son Angad begins to follow Ram and joins the monkey army. Sugriva and Ram instruct Hanuman to enquire about Sita and her well being. He also gives him his ring as a mark of his well being to Sita.\n\n===Sundar Kand===\n\n[[Hanuman]] goes to Lanka and meets Sita. He also gives her Ram's ring. Sita gets shocked when she comes to know about Ram's condition. [[Ravan]] instructs his second son [[Akshayakumara]] to attack Hanuman. Mandodari knows about Hanuman's strength and fears because she doesn't want to lose her son. Instead, she wants [[Akshayakumara]] to leave Lanka. Akshay heads his father's words and attempts to attack Hanuman. Hanuman, with his wit and power, kills [[Akshayakumara]]. Soldiers bring his dead body to the king. All get shocked to see this, and [[Mandodari]] gets shattered to see her deceased son. Hanuman is brought to the king by the soldiers, and Ravan decides to punish Hanuman by sentencing him to death. But [[Vibhishan]] advises to mutilate one of his body parts rather than killing him. Ravan chooses to burn his tail. All the men and Meghnadh burn the rear. Sita comes to know about this and prays to Agni devta to produce coolness instead of burning sensation to Hanuman. Hanuman burns the whole unethical Lanka with his tail. Sita gives her chudamani (head ornament) to Hanuman as a mark of her presence in Lanka. Hanuman leaves Lanka.\n\nVibhishan pleads his brother Ravan to free Sita and handover her to Ram as she is someone's wife. Ravan kicks Vibhishan and considers him as his enemy. He throws him out of Lanka. Hanuman reaches Ram and tells about Sita being in Ashok Vatika. Ram vows to free Sita from Ravan's captivity and kill him.\n\nRam, Lakshman, and the whole monkey army decide to construct a sea bridge ([[Ram Setu]]) across the ocean to Lanka. Two other monkeys, Nal and Neel, join the monkey army. Ram prays to Lord Shiva before constructing the bridge. Ram, along with the monkey army, constructs the bridge and goes to Lanka. Vibhishan joins Ram's army and tells them that he will help them in the war.\n\n===Yuddha Kand===\n\nRam, Lakshman, and the monkey army reach Lanka, and Ram declares the war against Ravan. Ravan plans troops to attack the monkey army at midnight. Ravan's army attacks the monkey army as per plan. Meghnadh plans to kill Ram and Lakshman. With his illusion, he shoots an invisible venomous arrow on Ram and Lakshman. They become unconscious. There was no way to cure them because it is a potent poison. Ravan becomes happy that his son Meghnadh has killed Ram and Lakshman. Sita feels shattered when she hears that Ram has died. Lord Shiva then decides to request the King of birds, Lord Garuda (Lord Vishnu's vehicle, and thus Lord Ram's as well) to save Ram and Lakshman, which he does.\n\nRam then kills many more warriors in the war, including Ravan's younger brother [[Kumbhakarna]]. This gravely angers Ravan, and he decides to kill Ram as soon as possible. After that, he sends Meghanad (his son) to fight Ram-Lakshman. He goes to the battlefield and fights Lakshman. He uses Shakti on Lakshman, and Lakshman goes in an unconscious state. Trijata tells Ram's army the address of Sushena. Hanuman flies to the house of Sushena. Sushena tells the only option to save Lakshman is Sanjeevani Booti. Hanuman flies to the Himalayas to get Sanjeevani. After he returns, a Lepa of Sanjeevani is drunk by Lakshman, which brings him back to life. While in Lanka, Meghnad does the Devi Yagya to get Divine Weapons and Divine Horsecart. The disadvantage of this Yagya was that if the Yagya is stopped in between, then the person doing it gets killed. The vanar sena disturbs Meghnad. Lakshman chops off the head of Meghanad. After this, Raavan enters the battlefield. Ram gets hurt, and Ravana nearly strangles him to death. Each time he attacks Ravan, he gets back. Vibhishana tells the secret of Ravan to Ram that he had nectar in his navel. Ram then shots the arrows at Ravan's navel. Ravan dies. After the death of the cruel ten-headed King Ravan, Ram crowns Vibhishana, as the King of Lanka. Now everyone goes to Sita in Ashoka Vatika. But, Ram doesn't accept to take Sita back to Ayodhya. Sita undergoes an Agni pariksha to prove her chastity. Everyone says Goodbye to each other. Ram, Lakshman, Sita, Vibhishana, Hanumana, Sugriva, Angada all leave for Ayodhya.\n\n<br />\n===Uttara Kand===\n\nAfter being crowned king, Ram spends life pleasantly with Sita. Sita gets pregnant. Rumors about Sita's purity spread among the populace of Ayodhya. Ram banishes Sita to the forest due to the rumors. A dejected Sita beseeches her mother, Goddess [[Bh\u016bmi|Bhumi]], to give her advice and aid her in her time of need. A furious Bhumi decides to destroy Ayodhya and the clan of Raghu as punishment for Sita's undeserving plight. Sita requests her mother not to destroy them and promises her that the day she has completely fulfilled all her duties, she would seek refuge from her and return to her. Later, Sage Valmiki provides shelter to Sita in his hermitage, where she gives birth to twin boys [[Lava (Ramayana)|Lava]] and [[Kusha (Ramayana)|Kusha]]. Sita raises them as a single mother but incognito under the name of Vaidehi. After 12 years, Ram decides to perform the [[Ashwamedha]] Yagna, and the twins catch the horse of the Yagna after which a terrible battle ensues. After defeating Lakshman, Bharata, and Shatrughna as well as Hanuman, the twins are about to battle with their father, but Sita stops them and requests Ram to forgive them. She then reveals to the twins that Ram is their father, and they realize that their mother is the very Sita herself who they fought for, to give her justice.\n\nRam decides to bring Sita back and asks the people of Ayodhya if he could do so. He proceeds with the entire family to bring Sita back, and there Luva and Kusha are united with Ram. Sita refuses to return to Ayodhya as it was that society who doubted her character, and she cannot return to it as it would be wrong on her part and betray all those other women who have suffered the same plight as her. As a final testament to her purity, Sita returns to her celestial abode by going back to her mother, Bhumi, after confronting Ram. Ram is left heartbroken at this and returns to Ayodhya. He then promotes woman rights on Sita's behalf. After some years, Ram crowns Luva and Kusha as Kings of Ayodhya and along with his brothers - Bharat and Shatrughan drown themselves in the [[Sarayu river]]. Lakshman precedes his brothers, being the incarnation of [[Sheshnaag]].\n\nAt the bottom of the lake, Ram turns to Vishnu. Shatrughan transforms into the Sudarshan Chakra and Bharat to the conch shell of Vishnu's. They go back to Vishnu, and Vishnu sees Lakshmi coming towards him, telling him that he took a long time to join her and then said that they should return to their abode. Meanwhile, Hanuman says to the populace of Ayodhya that Ram and Sita live forever in them all, and he tears open his chest to show Ram and Sita in his heart.\n\n==Cast==\n===Main===\n*[[Ashish Sharma]] as [[Rama|Siya Pati Ram Chandra -]] Lord Vishnu's 7th avatar;

While Mithila has suffered a drought for 12 years, elsewhere, [[Rama|Ram]] and his brothers are under the tutelage of Guru [[Vashista]]. Janak builds a golden plow and unearths a baby girl as he begins to plow. The baby's first cry leads to rainfall. Janak wants to find out whether or not the baby has a family. He is shocked to see the baby lift the [[Shiv Dhanush]]. Rishi [[Yagyavalkya]] suggests that Janak keeps the baby and so he names her [[Sita]].\n\nIt is shown that after eight years, Sita and her sisters are playing the act of Goddess [[Durga]], who destroyed a [[Rakshasa]]. Soon afterward, Sita comes to know about [[Gautama Maharishi]] and the curse he gave to his wife [[Ahilya (Hindu mythology)|Ahilya]]. Meanwhile, King [[Dasharatha]] is traveling to Guru [[Vashistha]]'s ashram to see his sons and gets inspired by [[Rama|Ram]]. Ram comes to his kingdom and meets his mother. Meanwhile, he comes to know that he has an elder sister called [[Shanta]].\n\nLater, it is shown that both Ram and Sita have grown up. In [[Ayodhya]], King [[Dasharatha]] conducts the [[Ashwamedha]] [[Yajna]] for the well-being of his sons and his kingdom. While traveling towards Mithila, Sita dares to stop the ceremonial horse and comforts it. After coming back, Ram tells not to kill the horse but spare its life.\n\nGuru [[Vishvamitra]] takes Ram and [[Lakshman]] from Ayodhya to destroy the demoness queen [[Tataka]]. Sita and her sisters also travel along with [[Kushadhwaja]] to see Guru Vishvamitra. They give [[Lakshman]] some food. Soon Taraka and her son [[Subahu]] are killed by Ram and Lakshman. Guru Vishvamitra tells him that he wants to take both of them to [[Mithila (ancient)|Mithila]] and seek the blessings of [[Shiv Dhanush]]. While traveling to Mithila, he sees Rishi Gautam and Ahilya's ashram and cures her curse. Gautam Rishi seeks his greatness to Ram. Meanwhile, Sita comes to know about her birth. Sita falls in love with Ram without seeing him. Ram comes to Mithila, and they meet for the first time at the [[Parvati]] temple. Soon after, [[Sita]]'s [[Swayamvar]] is announced. [[Lanka]] king [[Ravana]]'s grandfather and minister [[Malyavan]] travels to Mithila to see the greatness of the kingdom and argues with Sita. Then he informs [[Ravana]] that Tataka is killed.\n\nIn the Swayamvara, nobody can lift the [[Shiv Dhanush]] except Ram. Ram's marriage is fixed with Sita. On the other hand, Ravan is angry that he was unable to lift the Shiv Dhanush, and [[Janak]] has insulted him. So he vows to avenge the king. Afterward, Ravan comes to know that he will die because of a woman. Ravan remembers the day he tried to force himself upon a chaste woman, [[Vedavati]]. She had then cursed him that the cause of his death will be a woman. Remembering this, Ravan goes to Yamlok, the abode of [[Yama]], in the hope that if he keeps [[Yama]] under his thumb, he can elude death. However, Goddess of Death Mrityu Devi appears, and a terrible fight ensues between her and Ravan. Ravan soon gets overpowered. Ram and Sita get married along with Ram's brothers and Sita's sisters ([[Lakshman]]-[[Urmila]], [[Bharata (Ramayana)|Bharat]]-[[Mandavi]], [[Shatrughna]]-[[Shrutakirti]]).\n\nMeanwhile, in [[Lanka]], [[Mandodri]] gets worried about the death of Ravan and decides to seek help from a [[Vishnu]] devotee. Mithila bids farewell to Sita and her sisters.\n\n===Ayodhya Kand===\n\n[[Mandodari]] tells her father [[Mayasura]] that [[Ravan|Ravan's]] life is in danger, but he refuses to help. According to the series, she had left with Ravan against her parent's wishes. Her mother, however, guides her in getting the [[Amrita]]. Mandodari goes to [[Moon|Chandralok]] to get the [[Amrita]]. [[Vibhishana]] warns [[Mandodari]] that [[Ravan]] should not find out about his immortality. [[Mandodari]] succeeds to an extent in her plan of making [[Ravan]] immortal. Elsewhere Ram, Lakshman, Bharat, and Shatrughna reach [[Ayodhya]] with their brides. [[Kaushalya]], [[Kaikeyi]] ,and [[Sumitra]] welcome them. An [[Aghori]] predicts [[Manthara|Manthara's]] future and tells her that she will be thrown out of the palace. [[Ravan]] challenges the gods to stop him from conquering the world. Ravan confronts [[Surpanakha]] for marrying a demon, Vidyutjiva, who is Raavan's enemy. Meanwhile, Bharat and Shatrughan set off to meet [[Ashwapati]], their grandfather.\n\nDasharath announces Ram to be his heir to the throne. Kaushalya, Sumitra, and Lakshman are ecstatic to know that Ram will be crowned the king of [[Ayodhya]]. [[Manthara]] is determined to stop Ram from becoming the king. She reminds Kaikeyi about Dasharath's promise to Ashwapati and feeds that Dasharath is conspiring against her. [[Kaikeyi]] decides to stop Ram's coronation. Kaikeyi reminds [[Dasharath]] about the promises that he had given her. He vows to fulfill two wishes. Kaikeyi tells him to crown Bharat as the king of [[Ayodhya]] and send Ram into exile for 14 years.\n\nDasharath hesitantly agrees to crown Bharat, the king, and send Ram away. Sita urges Ram to take her along with him. [[Urmila]] supports [[Lakshman|Lakshman's]] decision of accompanying Ram. Ram leaves [[Ayodhya]] in his exile with Sita and Lakshman. Bharat and Shatrughna receive a message asking them to return to Ayodhya. A grieving [[Dasharatha]] passes away and [[Sumitra]] blames Kaikeyi for his death. Bharat asks [[Mandavi]] and [[Vashistha]] about Ram. When he learns about [[Kaikeyi|Kaikeyi's]] misdeed, he blames her for Dashrath's death. He confronts her for her actions against Ram. Bharata refuses to become the king of Ayodhya. Bharat and Janak decide to bring Ram back to Ayodhya. [[Kaikeyi]] is grateful to Janak for reminding her about her love for Ram. She requests Bharat to take her along with him to meet Ram.\n\nRam meets Bharat and is depressed on learning about Dasharath's death. Bharat requests Ram to return to Ayodhya, but he refuses. He tells Janak that he will not return because he wants to fulfill the promise he had made to Dasharath. Bharat asks Ram for his sandals. Bharat places Ram's sandals on the throne. He apologizes to Vashisht, saying he cannot take over Ram's place. Shatrughna confronts Bharata for his decision to become a tapas. Bharat assures [[Kaushalya]] that he will stay near Ayodhya. He asks Shatrughna to help him in keeping his promise to Ram to take care of Ayodhya. [[Lakshman]] tells Ram and Sita that Goddess Nidradevi has given him a boon to stay awake so that he can serve them. On Lakshman's request, Nidradevi gives his share of sleep to [[Urmila]], until he returns to Ayodhya.\n\n===Aranya Kand===\n\nRam conveys to [[Sita]] about his wish to protect the Rishis and people from the demons. They complete ten years of their vanvas. [[Sugriva]] tells [[Hanuman]] about [[Rum\u0101]]. Hanuman conveys to [[Rum\u0101]] that Sugriva loves her and wants to marry her. [[Vali (Ramayana)|Bali]] decides to get Sugriva married to [[Rum\u0101]]. Ravan decides to send [[Khara (Ramayana)|Khar]] and [[Dushan (Ramayana)|Dushan]] to take control of Dandakaranya. [[Surpanakha]] insists [[Ravan]] to let her go to [[Dandakaranya]]. Malyavan shares his plan to take over [[Kishkindha]] with [[Meghanad]]. Dundubi comes up with a plan to kill [[Vali (Ramayana)|Bali]] and Sugriva. Dundubi disguises as a buffalo and battles with [[Vali (Ramayana)|Bali]]. [[Vali (Ramayana)|Bali]] kills Dundubi. Rishi Matang curses [[Vali (Ramayana)|Bali]] for breaking his meditation. Ram kills Ravan's soldiers and saves the residents of Panchvati. Surpanakha falls in love with Ram.\n\nMayavi decides to take Bali to the Rishimukh mountain. [[Vali (Ramayana)|Bali]] follows Mayavi into a cave and asks Sugriva to wait outside until he returns. However, Sugriva is shocked at hearing [[Vali (Ramayana)|Bali]]'s screams. He closes the mouth of the cave by a big stone as he assumes that [[Vali (Ramayana)|Bali]] was killed by Mayavi. Sugriva suggests that Tara makes [[Angad]], the king of Kishkindha.\n\n[[Shurpanakha]] urges Ram to marry her, but he tells her that he is already married. Shurpanakha plans to prove herself better than [[Sita]]. Ram gets irate when Shurpanakha comes to him dressed like [[Sita]]. She attacks [[Sita]]. [[Lakshmana]] cuts Shurpanakha's nose. [[Surpanakha]] asks [[Khara (Ramayana)|Khara]] to kill Ram, [[Sita]], and Lakshman. Khara attacks Ram with his asuras. Ram kills Khara and Dushan by using his powers. Shurpanakha reaches [[Lanka]], tells everyone about the attack. Surpanakha asks [[Ravan]] to avenge her insult by Ram. Ravan decides to punish Ram for his deeds. [[Sugriva]]'s coronation ceremony begins. [[Hanuman]] crowns Sugriva as the king of [[Kishkindha]]. A furious [[Vali (Ramayana)|Bali]] returns to Kishkindha and attacks Sugriva for locking him up in the cave. Hanuman rescues Sugriva from [[Vali (Ramayana)|Bali]]. Ravan gets information about Ram and learns that Sita is Ram's weakness. He also remembers the incident at Sita's swayamvar and his oath to take revenge from Janak. Ravan decides to abduct Sita. Ravan tells Marich about Surpanakha's humiliation and seeks his help to avenge her insult. Hanuman takes Sugriva to Rishimukh mountain.\n\nMarich disguises himself as an injured golden deer to distract Ram from [[Sita]] and leads him far into the forest. [[Sita]] sees the injured golden deer and tells Ram that she wants to cure it. Ram tells Lakshman to stay with [[Sita]] while he goes to bring the deer. Meanwhile, [[Hanuman]] tells [[Sugriva]] that [[Vali (Ramayana)|Bali]] has made [[Rum\u0101]] his slave. Hanuman tells Sugriva that he will seek help from the other kings to defeat Bali. However, Ram is shocked when Marich calls out to Sita and Lakshman in his voice. Sita is worried about hearing Ram's cries. Marich apologizes to Ram for his misdeed and dies. [[Sita]] orders Lakshman to go into the jungle to look for Ram. Lakshman hesitantly agrees and draws a powerful line [[Lakshmana Rekha]] which no immoral creature could cross to protect Sita, but tells Sita not to cross it or the power would go. Lakshman leaves. [[Ravan]] disguises as a sage and tricks Sita to cross the [[Lakshmana Rekha]] line. Sita tries to run, but he ends up abducting her.\n\nOn the way to Lanka, [[Jatayu]] tries to save [[Sita]], but Ravan cuts off both his wings. [[Sita]] then throws her jewelry to the ground hoping Ram will see it as a sign. [[Sita]] tells Ravan to kill her and avenge himself. Ravan kidnaps Sita and takes her to Lanka. [[Surpanakha]] is delighted to see [[Sita]] in [[Lanka]]. Later, Ravan stops Surpanakha from attacking [[Sita]]. He tells her to keep [[Sita]] alive until he avenges her insult.\n\nRavan's mother [[Kaikesi]], tells him that he should marry [[Sita]] as she is a powerful woman instead of treating her badly. [[Sita]] finds her place in the garden of Lanka ([[Ashoka Vatika]]) and refuses Ravan's proposal saying that she is always going to love Ram and never be unfaithful to him. She decides to wait for him until her death. Meanwhile, Ram comes to know about the abduction from the bird Jatayu.\n\n===Kishkindha Kand===\n\n[[Hanuman]] meets Ram and becomes his devotee. He narrates about [[Sugriva]]'s problem and his brother Bali misbehaving with his wife, [[Rum\u0101]]. Ram challenges to kill Bali and liberate him from all his sins. He directs Sugriv to go on a duel with Bali so that he can kill him during that time. Everything happens accordingly, and Ram kills Bali. Bali regrets his mistakes and dies. Sugriva is crowned the king of [[Kishkindha]]. Bali's son Angad begins to follow Ram and joins the monkey army. Sugriva and Ram instruct Hanuman to enquire about Sita and her well being. He also gives him his ring as a mark of his well being to Sita.\n\n===Sundar Kand===\n\n[[Hanuman]] goes to Lanka and meets Sita. He also gives her Ram's ring. Sita gets shocked when she comes to know about Ram's condition. [[Ravan]] instructs his second son [[Akshayakumara]] to attack Hanuman. Mandodari knows about Hanuman's strength and fears because she doesn't want to lose her son. Instead, she wants [[Akshayakumara]] to leave Lanka. Akshay heads his father's words and attempts to attack Hanuman. Hanuman, with his wit and power, kills [[Akshayakumara]]. Soldiers bring his dead body to the king. All get shocked to see this, and [[Mandodari]] gets shattered to see her deceased son. Hanuman is brought to the king by the soldiers, and Ravan decides to punish Hanuman by sentencing him to death. But [[Vibhishan]] advises to mutilate one of his body parts rather than killing him. Ravan chooses to burn his tail. All the men and Meghnadh burn the rear. Sita comes to know about this and prays to Agni devta to produce coolness instead of burning sensation to Hanuman. Hanuman burns the whole unethical Lanka with his tail. Sita gives her chudamani (head ornament) to Hanuman as a mark of her presence in Lanka. Hanuman leaves Lanka.\n\nVibhishan pleads his brother Ravan to free Sita and handover her to Ram as she is someone's wife. Ravan kicks Vibhishan and considers him as his enemy. He throws him out of Lanka. Hanuman reaches Ram and tells about Sita being in Ashok Vatika. Ram vows to free Sita from Ravan's captivity and kill him.\n\nRam, Lakshman, and the whole monkey army decide to construct a sea bridge ([[Ram Setu]]) across the ocean to Lanka. Two other monkeys, Nal and Neel, join the monkey army. Ram prays to Lord Shiva before constructing the bridge. Ram, along with the monkey army, constructs the bridge and goes to Lanka. Vibhishan joins Ram's army and tells them that he will help them in the war.\n\n===Yuddha Kand===\n\nRam, Lakshman, and the monkey army reach Lanka, and Ram declares the war against Ravan. Ravan plans troops to attack the monkey army at midnight. Ravan's army attacks the monkey army as per plan. Meghnadh plans to kill Ram and Lakshman. With his illusion, he shoots an invisible venomous arrow on Ram and Lakshman. They become unconscious. There was no way to cure them because it is a potent poison. Ravan becomes happy that his son Meghnadh has killed Ram and Lakshman. Sita feels shattered when she hears that Ram has died. Lord Shiva then decides to request the King of birds, Lord Garuda (Lord Vishnu's vehicle, and thus Lord Ram's as well) to save Ram and Lakshman, which he does.\n\nRam then kills many more warriors in the war, including Ravan's younger brother [[Kumbhakarna]]. This gravely angers Ravan, and he decides to kill Ram as soon as possible. After that, he sends Meghanad (his son) to fight Ram-Lakshman. He goes to the battlefield and fights Lakshman. He uses Shakti on Lakshman, and Lakshman goes in an unconscious state. Trijata tells Ram's army the address of Sushena. Hanuman flies to the house of Sushena. Sushena tells the only option to save Lakshman is Sanjeevani Booti. Hanuman flies to the Himalayas to get Sanjeevani. After he returns, a Lepa of Sanjeevani is drunk by Lakshman, which brings him back to life. While in Lanka, Meghnad does the Devi Yagya to get Divine Weapons and Divine Horsecart. The disadvantage of this Yagya was that if the Yagya is stopped in between, then the person doing it gets killed. The vanar sena disturbs Meghnad. Lakshman chops off the head of Meghanad. After this, Raavan enters the battlefield. Ram gets hurt, and Ravana nearly strangles him to death. Each time he attacks Ravan, he gets back. Vibhishana tells the secret of Ravan to Ram that he had nectar in his navel. Ram then shots the arrows at Ravan's navel. Ravan dies. After the death of the cruel ten-headed King Ravan, Ram crowns Vibhishana, as the King of Lanka. Now everyone goes to Sita in Ashoka Vatika. But, Ram doesn't accept to take Sita back to Ayodhya. Sita undergoes an Agni pariksha to prove her chastity. Everyone says Goodbye to each other. Ram, Lakshman, Sita, Vibhishana, Hanumana, Sugriva, Angada all leave for Ayodhya.\n\n<br />\n===Uttara Kand===\n\nAfter being crowned king, Ram spends life pleasantly with Sita. Sita gets pregnant. Rumors about Sita's purity spread among the populace of Ayodhya. Ram banishes Sita to the forest due to the rumors. A dejected Sita beseeches her mother, Goddess [[Bh\u016bmi|Bhumi]], to give her advice and aid her in her time of need. A furious Bhumi decides to destroy Ayodhya and the clan of Raghu as punishment for Sita's undeserving plight. Sita requests her mother not to destroy them and promises her that the day she has completely fulfilled all her duties, she would seek refuge from her and return to her. Later, Sage Valmiki provides shelter to Sita in his hermitage, where she gives birth to twin boys [[Lava (Ramayana)|Lava]] and [[Kusha (Ramayana)|Kusha]]. Sita raises them as a single mother but incognito under the name of Vaidehi. After 12 years, Ram decides to perform the [[Ashwamedha]] Yagna, and the twins catch the horse of the Yagna after which a terrible battle ensues. After defeating Lakshman, Bharata, and Shatrughna as well as Hanuman, the twins are about to battle with their father, but Sita stops them and requests Ram to forgive them. She then reveals to the twins that Ram is their father, and they realize that their mother is the very Sita herself who they fought for, to give her justice.\n\nRam decides to bring Sita back and asks the people of Ayodhya if he could do so. He proceeds with the entire family to bring Sita back, and there Luva and Kusha are united with Ram. Sita refuses to return to Ayodhya as it was that society who doubted her character, and she cannot return to it as it would be wrong on her part and betray all those other women who have suffered the same plight as her. As a final testament to her purity, Sita returns to her celestial abode by going back to her mother, Bhumi, after confronting Ram. Ram is left heartbroken at this and returns to Ayodhya. He then promotes woman rights on Sita's behalf. After some years, Ram crowns Luva and Kusha as Kings of Ayodhya and along with his brothers - Bharat and Shatrughan drown themselves in the [[Sarayu river]]. Lakshman precedes his brothers, being the incarnation of [[Sheshnaag]].\n\nAt the bottom of the lake, Ram turns to Vishnu. Shatrughan transforms into the Sudarshan Chakra and Bharat to the conch shell of Vishnu's.

He and Hansen circled the track together and Hansen raised Michard's arm in acknowledgement of victory. Moments later, the announcer said it was Hansen who had won. There was immediate commotion around the chief judge, [[Alban Collignon]], who was president of the [[Belgian Cycling Association]]. He quickly realised his mistake.\n\nHe had watched the riders start the run to the line and had seen Hansen on the inside of the track and Michard outside him.

The rule was that the judge's decision, once announced, was final.<ref>Augendre, Jacques, La Loi des F\u00e9d\u00e9rations, \u00c9clair Mondial, France, p218</ref> It was intended to stop riders disputing a result. That was what it prevented for both Hansen and Michard, but the [[Union Cycliste Internationale]] hadn't foreseen that a judge might wish to change his mind.\n\nMichard challenged the UCI but the court ruled the event was out of its authority<ref name=\"Chany 401\"/> and the UCI did not reverse the decision and Hansen wore the rainbow jersey of world champion for the rest of the year. He wore it in the many revenge matches that he and Michard were contracted to ride around Europe. Michard wore a jersey of his own, showing not rainbow stripes but globes of the world.<ref>Chany, Pierre (1988), La Fabuleuse Histoire de Cyclisme, Nathan, France, p402</ref>\n\nThe episode ended Michard's career at the top. He was displaced by another little sprinter, [[Jef Scherens]] of [[Belgium]], to whom Michard finished second in 1931 and 1933. He did, however, win national championships in 1933, 1934 and 1935, before a strike with other riders against what they saw as poor payments at the Parc des Princes and V\u00e9lodrome d'Hiver led to a newspaper campaign which prompted his retirement.<ref>Sporting Cyclist, UK, February 1968, p32</ref> He began selling bicycles made under his name<ref name=braq-michard/> and sponsored a professional team in 1939 along with the tyre maker, Hutchinson.<ref name=cyclisme-michard>{{cite web |url=http://www.siteducyclisme.net/ploegfiche.php?id=11854 |title=Lucien Michard - Hutchinson 1939 |author= |work= |publisher=Le cite du cyclisme |date= |language=French |accessdate=2008-11-15}}</ref>\n\nA road is named after him in [[Aiguillon, Lot-et-Garonne|Aiguillon]], where he lived most of his life.<ref name=ville-aiguillon>{{cite web|url=https://ville-aiguillon.eu/component/option%2Ccom_docman/task%2Cdoc_view/gid%2C115/Itemid%2C162/ |title=De nouvelles d\u00e9nominations de rues dans notre ville |author= |work= |publisher= |date= |language=French |accessdate=2008-11-15 }}{{dead link|date=June 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>\n\n==Achievements==\n\n* Record 500m flying start: 29\" 800, 1932\n* Record kilometre flying start: 1' 07\" 200, 1931\n* Record \u00bdm: 56\" 200, 1931\n* Record \u00bem: 1' 29\" 200, 1931\n* Record tandem 500m (with Louis Chaillot): 34\" 800, 1938\n* Record tandem \u00bdm (Chaillot): 52\" 800, 1938\n* Record tandem \u00bem (Chaillot): 1' 08\", 1938\n* Olympic sprint: 1924\n* World championship sprint: 1923 (amateur), 1924 (amateur), 1927, 1928, 1929, 1930\n* Coupe d'Europe: 1935\n* National sprint champion: 1922, 1924, 1925, 1927, 1928, 1929, 1930, 1933, 1934, 1935\n* National sprint champion juniors: 1923, 1924\n* National sprint champion military: 1924\n* Crit\u00e9rium International: 1936\n* Crit\u00e9rium National: 1934, 1936\n* Crit\u00e9rium National d'hiver: 1937\n* Challenge Victor Goddet: 1932, 1935\n* GP Riguelle: 1922\n* GP Paris: 1922, 1924, 1930, 1931, 1932, 1935, 1936\n* GP UVF: 1924, 1925, 1926, 1928, 1931, 1932\n* GP de la R\u00e9publique: 1925, 1927, 1929, 1932\n* GP de la Toussaint: 1926\n* GP Copenhagen: 1927, 1929, 1930\n* GP Angoul\u00eame: 1928\n* GP Clermont: 1928, 1932\n* GP UCI: 1929, 1930, 1933, 1937\n* GP Brest: 1934\n* GP Amiens: 1934, 1935\n* GP Reims: 1934\n* GP Algiers: 1935\n* GP Cologne: 1935\n* GP Cognac: 1936\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n{{Footer Olympic Champions Track Individual Sprint Men}}\n{{UCI Track Cycling World Champions \u2013 Men's sprint}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Michard, Lucien}}\n[[Category:1903 births]]\n[[Category:1985 deaths]]\n[[Category:French male cyclists]]\n[[Category:Olympic gold medalists for France]]\n[[Category:Cyclists at the 1924 Summer Olympics]]\n[[Category:Olympic cyclists of France]]\n[[Category:Olympic medalists in cycling]]\n[[Category:Sportspeople from \u00c9pinay-sur-Seine]]\n[[Category:Medalists at the 1924 Summer Olympics]]\n[[Category:UCI Track Cycling World Champions (men)]]\n[[Category:French track cyclists]]\n", "text_old": "{{Use dmy dates|date=January 2014}}\n{{MedalTableTop|Lucien Michard.jpg|200px|Michard in 1930}}\n{{MedalSport|Men's [[track cycling]]}}\n{{MedalCountry| {{FRA}} }}\n{{MedalCompetition|[[Olympic Games]]}}\n{{MedalGold| [[1924 Summer Olympics|1924 Paris]] | [[Cycling at the 1924 Summer Olympics \u2013 Men's sprint|Sprint]]}}\n{{MedalCompetition|[[UCI Track Cycling World Championships - Men's Sprint|World Championships]]}}\n{{MedalGold| Cologne 1927 | Sprint}}\n{{MedalGold| Budapest 1928 | Sprint}}\n{{MedalGold| Z\u00fcrich 1929 | Sprint}}\n{{MedalGold| Brussels 1930 | Sprint}}\n{{MedalSilver| Copenhagen 1931 | Sprint}}\n{{MedalSilver| Rome 1932 | Sprint}}\n{{MedalSilver| Paris 1933 | Sprint}}\n{{MedalBottom}}\n\n'''Lucien Michard''' (born [[\u00c9pinay-sur-Seine]], [[France]], 17 November 1903, died 1 November 1985) was a [[France|French]] [[racing cyclist]] and Olympic track champion.

The rule was that the judge's decision, once announced, was final.<ref>Augendre, Jacques, La Loi des F\u00e9d\u00e9rations, \u00c9clair Mondial, France, p218</ref> It was intended to stop riders disputing a result. That was what it prevented for both Hansen and Michard, but the [[Union Cycliste Internationale]] hadn't foreseen that a judge might wish to change his mind.\n\nMichard challenged the UCI but the court ruled the event was out of its authority<ref name=\"Chany 401\"/> and the UCI did not reverse the decision and Hansen wore the rainbow jersey of world champion for the rest of the year. He wore it in the many revenge matches that he and Michard were contracted to ride around Europe. Michard wore a jersey of his own, showing not rainbow stripes but globes of the world.<ref>Chany, Pierre (1988), La Fabuleuse Histoire de Cyclisme, Nathan, France, p402</ref>\n\nThe episode ended Michard's career at the top. He was displaced by another little sprinter, [[Jef Scherens]] of [[Belgium]], to whom Michard finished second in 1931 and 1933. He did, however, win national championships in 1933, 1934 and 1935, before a strike with other riders against what they saw as poor payments at the Parc des Princes and V\u00e9lodrome d'Hiver led to a newspaper campaign which prompted his retirement.<ref>Sporting Cyclist, UK, February 1968, p32</ref> He began selling bicycles made under his name<ref name=braq-michard/> and sponsored a professional team in 1939 along with the tyre maker, Hutchinson.<ref name=cyclisme-michard>{{cite web |url=http://www.siteducyclisme.net/ploegfiche.php?id=11854 |title=Lucien Michard - Hutchinson 1939 |author= |work= |publisher=Le cite du cyclisme |date= |language=French |accessdate=2008-11-15}}</ref>\n\nA road is named after him in [[Aiguillon, Lot-et-Garonne|Aiguillon]], where he lived most of his life.<ref name=ville-aiguillon>{{cite web|url=https://ville-aiguillon.eu/component/option%2Ccom_docman/task%2Cdoc_view/gid%2C115/Itemid%2C162/ |title=De nouvelles d\u00e9nominations de rues dans notre ville |author= |work= |publisher= |date= |language=French |accessdate=2008-11-15 }}{{dead link|date=June 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>\n\n==Achievements==\n\n* Record 500m flying start: 29\" 800, 1932\n* Record kilometre flying start: 1' 07\" 200, 1931\n* Record \u00bdm: 56\" 200, 1931\n* Record \u00bem: 1' 29\" 200, 1931\n* Record tandem 500m (with Louis Chaillot): 34\" 800, 1938\n* Record tandem \u00bdm (Chaillot): 52\" 800, 1938\n* Record tandem \u00bem (Chaillot): 1' 08\", 1938\n* Olympic sprint: 1924\n* World championship sprint: 1923 (amateur), 1924 (amateur), 1927, 1928, 1929, 1930\n* Coupe d'Europe: 1935\n* National sprint champion: 1922, 1924, 1925, 1927, 1928, 1929, 1930, 1933, 1934, 1935\n* National sprint champion juniors: 1923, 1924\n* National sprint champion military: 1924\n* Crit\u00e9rium International: 1936\n* Crit\u00e9rium National: 1934, 1936\n* Crit\u00e9rium National d'hiver: 1937\n* Challenge Victor Goddet: 1932, 1935\n* GP Riguelle: 1922\n* GP Paris: 1922, 1924, 1930, 1931, 1932, 1935, 1936\n* GP UVF: 1924, 1925, 1926, 1928, 1931, 1932\n* GP de la R\u00e9publique: 1925, 1927, 1929, 1932\n* GP de la Toussaint: 1926\n* GP Copenhagen: 1927, 1929, 1930\n* GP Angoul\u00eame: 1928\n* GP Clermont: 1928, 1932\n* GP UCI: 1929, 1930, 1933, 1937\n* GP Brest: 1934\n* GP Amiens: 1934, 1935\n* GP Reims: 1934\n* GP Algiers: 1935\n* GP Cologne: 1935\n* GP Cognac: 1936\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n{{Footer Olympic Champions Track Individual Sprint Men}}\n{{UCI Track Cycling World Champions \u2013 Men's sprint}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Michard, Lucien}}\n[[Category:1903 births]]\n[[Category:1985 deaths]]\n[[Category:French male cyclists]]\n[[Category:Olympic gold medalists for France]]\n[[Category:Cyclists at the 1924 Summer Olympics]]\n[[Category:Olympic cyclists of France]]\n[[Category:Olympic medalists in cycling]]\n[[Category:Sportspeople from \u00c9pinay-sur-Seine]]\n[[Category:Medalists at the 1924 Summer Olympics]]\n[[Category:UCI Track Cycling World Champions (men)]]\n[[Category:French track cyclists]]\n", "name_user": "Lepricavark", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200etop:added short description", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lucien_Michard"}
