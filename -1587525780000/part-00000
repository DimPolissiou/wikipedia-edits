These canals had [[sluice]]s that were opened and closed to control the water flow. In other areas the administration encouraged the digging of wells monitored by administrative authorities.

[[Betel|Betel leaves]], [[areca]] (for chewing), and coconut were the principal cash crops, and large-scale cotton production supplied the weaving centers of the empire's vibrant textile industry. Spices such as [[turmeric]], pepper, [[cardamom]], and ginger grew in the remote [[Malnad]] hill region and were transported to the city for trade.

Most of the growers were [[tenant farmer]]s and were given the right of part ownership of the land over time.

Different temple building traditions in South and Central India came together in the [[Vijayanagara Architecture]] style. This synthesis inspired architectural innovation in [[Hindu temples]]' construction. Efficient administration and vigorous overseas trade brought new technologies such as water management systems for irrigation.
