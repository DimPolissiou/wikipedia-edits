The SEC holds primary responsibility for enforcing the federal [[security (finance)|securities]] laws, proposing securities rules, and regulating the securities industry, which is the nation's stock and options exchanges, and other activities and organizations, including the electronic securities markets in the United States.<ref>{{cite web\n | url = https://www.sec.gov/Article/whatwedo.html\n | title = What We Do\n | last = SEC\n | date = June 10, 2013\n | website = SEC.gov\n | publisher = U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission\n | access-date = 2017-03-24\n | quote = }}</ref>\n\nIn addition to the [[Securities Exchange Act of 1934]], which created it, the SEC enforces the [[Securities Act of 1933]], the [[Trust Indenture Act of 1939]], the [[Investment Company Act of 1940]], the [[Investment Advisers Act of 1940]], the [[Sarbanes\u2013Oxley Act|Sarbanes\u2013Oxley Act of 2002]], and other statutes.  The SEC was created by Section 4 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (now codified as {{usc|15|78d}} and commonly referred to as the Exchange Act or the 1934 Act).\n\n==Overview==\n{{more citations needed section|date=February 2017}}\n\nThe SEC has a three-part mission: to protect investors; maintain fair, orderly, and efficient markets; and facilitate capital formation.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://investor.gov/introduction-markets/role-sec|title=The Role of the SEC|last=|first=|date=|website=Investor.gov|publisher=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\nTo achieve its mandate, the SEC enforces the statutory requirement that [[public company|public companies]] and other regulated companies submit quarterly and [[annual report]]s, as well as other periodic reports. In addition to annual [[financial statements|financial reports]], company executives must provide a narrative account, called the \"[[management discussion and analysis]]\" (MD&A), that outlines the previous year of operations and explains how the company fared in that time period. MD&A will usually also touch on the upcoming year, outlining future goals and approaches to new projects. In an attempt to level the playing field for all investors, the SEC maintains an online database called [[EDGAR]] (the Electronic Data Gathering, Analysis, and Retrieval system) [[online and offline|online]] from which investors can access this and other information filed with the agency.\n\nQuarterly and semiannual reports from public companies are crucial for investors to make sound decisions when investing in the capital markets. Unlike [[bank]]ing, [[investment]] in the capital markets is not [[Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation|guaranteed]] by the federal government. The potential for big gains needs to be weighed against that of sizable losses. Mandatory disclosure of financial and other information about the issuer and the security itself gives private individuals as well as large institutions the same basic facts about the public companies they invest in, thereby increasing public scrutiny while reducing insider trading and [[fraud]].\n\nThe SEC makes reports available to the public through the EDGAR system. The SEC also offers publications on investment-related topics for public education. The same online system also takes tips and complaints from investors to help the SEC track down violators of the securities laws. The SEC adheres to a strict policy of never commenting on the existence or status of an ongoing investigation.\n\n==History==\nPrior to the enactment of the federal securities laws and the creation of the SEC, there existed so-called [[blue sky law]]s.  They were enacted and enforced at the state level and regulated the offering and sale of securities to protect the public from fraud. Though the specific provisions of these laws varied among states, they all required the registration of all securities offerings and sales, as well as of every U.S. [[stockbroker]] and brokerage firm.<ref name=\"bluesky\">{{cite web|url=http://www.seclaw.com/bluesky.htm |title=Blue Sky laws |publisher=Seclaw.com |date=July 7, 2007 |accessdate=March 1, 2013}}</ref>\n\nHowever, these blue sky laws were generally found to be ineffective. For example, the Investment Bankers Association told its members as early as 1915 that they could \"ignore\" blue sky laws by making securities offerings across state lines through the mail.<ref namean|title=The Transformation of Wall Street|pages=45, 51\u201352|publisher=Aspen|year=2003}}</ref> After holding hearings on abuses on interstate frauds (commonly known as the [[Pecora Commission]]), Congress passed the Securities Act of 1933 ({{usc|15|77a}}), which regulates interstate sales of securities ([[Primary market|original issues]]) at the federal level. The subsequent Securities Exchange Act of 1934 ({{usc|15|78d}}) regulates sales of securities in the [[secondary market]]. Section 4 of the 1934 act created the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission to enforce the federal securities laws; both laws are considered parts of [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]]'s [[New Deal]] raft of legislation.\n\n[[File:Joseph P. Kennedy, Sr. 1940.jpg|thumb|upright|left|[[Joseph P. Kennedy Sr.|Joseph P. Kennedy Sr]], the inaugural Chairman of the SEC]]\nThe Securities Act of 1933 is also known as the \"Truth in Securities Act\" and the \"Federal Securities Act\", or just the \"1933 Act\". Its goal was to increase public trust in the [[capital market]]s by requiring uniform disclosure of information about public securities offerings. The primary drafters of 1933 Act were Huston Thompson, a former [[Federal Trade Commission]] (FTC) chairman, and Walter Miller and Ollie Butler, two attorneys in the [[United States Department of Commerce|Commerce Department]]'s Foreign Service Division, with input from Supreme Court Justice [[Louis Brandeis]]. For the first year of the law's enactment, the enforcement of the statute rested with the Federal Trade Commission, but this power was transferred to the SEC following its creation in 1934.\n\nIn 1934, Roosevelt named his friend [[Joseph P. Kennedy]], a self-made multimillionaire  financier and a leader among the Irish-American community, as the insider-as-chairman who knew Wall Street well enough to clean it up.<ref>He was the father of president John F. Kennedy. David Nasaw, ''The Patriarch: The Remarkable Life and Turbulent Times of Joseph P. Kennedy'' (2012) pp 204-37.</ref> Two of the other five commissioners were [[James M. Landis]] (one of the architects of the 1934 Act and other New Deal legislation) and [[Ferdinand Pecora]] (Chief Counsel to the Senate Committee on Banking and Currency during its investigation of Wall Street banking and stock brokerage practices). Kennedy added a number of intelligent young lawyers, including [[William O. Douglas]] and [[Abe Fortas]], both of whom later became Supreme Court justices. Kennedy's team defined the mission and operating mode for the SEC, making full use of its wide range of legal powers. The SEC had four missions. First and most important was to restore investor confidence in the securities market, which had practically collapsed because of doubts about its internal integrity, and fears of the external threats supposedly posed by anti-business elements in the Roosevelt administration. Second, in terms of integrity, the SEC had to get rid of the penny-ante swindles based on fake information, fraudulent devices, and unsound get-rich-quick schemes. That unsavory element had to be prosecuted and shut down. Thirdly, and much more important than the outright frauds, the SEC had to end the million-dollar insider maneuvers by top officials of major corporations, whereby insiders with access to much better information about the condition of the company knew when to buy or sell their own securities. A crackdown on insider trading was given high priority. Finally, the SEC had to set up a complex system of registration for all securities sold in America, with a clear-cut set of deadlines, rules and guidelines that everyone had to follow. Drafting precise rules was the main challenge faced by the bright young lawyers. The SEC succeeded in its four missions, as Kennedy reassured the American business community that they would no longer be deceived and tricked and taken advantage of by Wall Street. He became a cheerleader for ordinary investors to return to the market and enable the economy to grow again.<ref>Nassau, ''The Patriarch,'' pp. 226\u201328</ref>\n\nThe law requires that issuing companies register distributions of securities with the SEC prior to interstate sales of these securities, so that investors may have access to basic financial information about issuing companies and risks involved in investing in the securities in question. Since 1994, most registration statements (and associated materials) filed with the SEC can be accessed via the SEC's online system, EDGAR.<ref name=\"Act1933\">{{cite web|url=https://www.sec.gov/about/laws/sa33.pdf |title=Securities Act of 1933 |accessdate=March 1, 2013}}</ref>\n\nThe Securities Exchange Act of 1934 is also known as \"the Exchange Act\" or \"the 1934 Act\". This act regulates secondary trading between individuals and companies which are often unrelated to the original issuers of securities. Entities under the SEC's authority include securities exchanges with physical trading floors such as the [[New York Stock Exchange]] (NYSE), [[self-regulatory organization]]s (SROs) such as the [[Financial Industry Regulatory Authority|National Association of Securities Dealers]] (NASD), the [[Municipal Securities Rulemaking Board]] (MSRB), online trading platforms such as the [[NASDAQ|NASDAQ Stock Market]] (NASDAQ) and [[alternative trading system]]s (ATSs), and any other persons (''e.g.'', securities brokers) engaged in transactions for the accounts of others.<ref name=\"Act1934\">{{cite web|url=https://www.sec.gov/about/laws/sea34.pdf |title=Securities Exchange Act of 1934 |accessdate=March 1, 2013}}</ref>\n \nLater SEC commissioners and chairmen include [[William O. Douglas]], [[Jerome Frank (lawyer)|Jerome Frank]] (one of the leaders of the [[legal realism]] movement), and [[William J. Casey]] (who later headed the [[Central Intelligence Agency]] under President [[Ronald Reagan]]).\n\nIn 2019, the Securities and Exchange Commission Historical Society introduced an online gallery to illustrate changes in the US securities market structure since the1930s. The online gallery features a narrative history supported by dozens of documents, papers, interviews, photos and videos.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.historyassociates.com/who-we-are/press-releases/securities-market-structure-exhibit/|title=History Associates Details the Evolution of Securities Market Structure in New Online Exhibit |publisher=History Associates |accessdate=28 April 2019}}</ref>\n\n==Organizational structure==\n\n===Commission members===\n{{main|Securities and Exchange Commission appointees}}\n\nThe Commission has five Commissioners who are appointed by the President of the United States. The commission is kept [[nonpartisan|Non-partisan]] as no more than three Commissioners may belong to the same political party. Their terms last five years and are staggered so that one commissioner's term ends on June 5 of each year. Service may continue up to eighteen additional months past term expiration.\n\nThe President also designates one of the Commissioners as Chairman, the SEC's top executive. However, the President does not possess the power to fire the appointed Commissioners, a provision that was made to ensure the independence of the SEC. This issue arose during the [[John McCain 2008 presidential campaign|2008 presidential election]] in connection with the [[Global financial crisis of 2008\u20132009|ensuing financial crises]].\n\nCurrently, the SEC Commissioners are:<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.sec.gov/about/commissioner.shtml |title=Current SEC Commissioners |publisher=Sec.gov |date=December 17, 2012 |accessdate=March 1, 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://citywireusa.com/registered-investment-advisor/news/senate-confirms-allison-herren-lee-to-sec-post/a1243288|last=Wenik |first=Ian |date=June 21, 2019|title=Senate confirms Allison Herren Lee to SEC post|work= [[Citywire]]|accessdate=June 21, 2019}}</ref>\n\n{|class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|-\n!

The division is also responsible for operating EDGAR.\n\nThe '''Trading and Markets''' division oversees self-regulatory organizations such as the [[Financial Industry Regulatory Authority]] (FINRA) and [[Municipal Securities Rulemaking Board]] (MSRB) and all [[broker-dealer]] firms and [[investment banking|investment houses]]. This division also interprets proposed changes to regulations and monitors operations of the industry. In practice, the SEC delegates most of its enforcement and rulemaking authority to FINRA. In fact, all trading firms not regulated by other SROs must register as a member of FINRA. Individuals trading securities must pass exams administered by FINRA to become [[General Securities Representative Exam|registered representatives]].<ref name=\"finra\">{{cite web|url=http://www.finra.com |title=National Association of Securities Dealers |publisher=Finra.com |accessdate=March 1, 2013}}</ref><ref name=\"nasdSec\">\"How does the NASD differ from the SEC?\" Investopedia.

The SEC generally conducts investigations in private.  The SEC's staff may seek voluntary production of documents and testimony, or may seek a formal order of investigation from the SEC, which allows the staff to compel the production of documents and witness testimony. The SEC can bring a [[lawsuit|civil action]] in a [[United States district court|U.S. District Court]], or an [[administrative proceeding]] which is heard by an independent [[administrative law judge]] (ALJ). The SEC does not have criminal authority but may refer matters to state and federal prosecutors. The director of the SEC's Enforcement Division  [[Robert Khuzami]] left the office in February 2013.<ref>{{cite news|last=Protess |first=Ben |url=https://dealbook.nytimes.com/2013/02/11/s-e-c-s-revolving-door-hurts-its-effectiveness-report-says/ |title=S.E.C.'s Revolving Door Hurts Its Effectiveness, Report Says |publisher=Dealbook.nytimes.com |accessdate=March 1, 2013 |date=February 11, 2013}}</ref>\n\nThe '''Economic and Risk Analysis''' Division (DERA) was created in September 2009 to integrate financial economics and rigorous data analytics into the core mission of the SEC. The Division is involved across the entire range of SEC activities, including policy-making, rule-making, enforcement, and examination. As the agency's \"think tank,\" DERA relies on a variety of academic disciplines, quantitative and non-quantitative approaches, and knowledge of market institutions and practices to help the Commission approach complex matters in a fresh light. DERA also assists in the Commission's efforts to identify, analyze, and respond to risks and trends, including those associated with new financial products and strategies. Through the range and nature of its activities, DERA serves the critical function of promoting collaborative efforts throughout the agency and breaking through silos that might otherwise limit the impact of the agency's institutional expertise. The Division's activities include providing detailed, high-quality economic and statistical analyses, and specific subject-matter expertise to the Commission and other Divisions/Offices and developing customized, analytic tools and analyses to proactively detect market risks indicative of possible violations of the Federal securities laws. Using data, DERA staff create analytic programs designed to detect patterns identifying risks, enabling Commission divisions and offices to deploy scarce resources targeting possible misconduct. DERA also houses the Commission's Chief Economist.{{citation needed|date=August 2019}}\n\n===Regional offices===\n11 regional offices throughout the US with the name of the regional director.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.sec.gov/page/sec-regional-offices|title=SEC Regional Offices|work=U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission|accessdate=June 12, 2019}}</ref>\n\n{{div-col|colwidth=18em|content=\n*Atlanta ~ Richard Best\n*Denver ~ Kurt Gottschall\n*Miami ~ Eric I.

The documents included those relating to \"[[Matters Under Inquiry]]\", or MUI, the name the SEC gives to the first stages of the investigation process. The tradition of destruction began as early as the 1990s. This SEC activity eventually caused a conflict with the [[National Archives and Records Administration]] when it was revealed to them in 2010 by Flynn. Flynn also described a meeting at the SEC in which top staff discussed ''refusing to admit the destruction had taken place, because it was possibly illegal''.<ref name=taibi20118/>\n\nIowa Republican Senator [[Charles Grassley]], among others, took note of Flynn's call for protection as a whistleblower, and the story of the agency's document-handling procedures. The SEC issued a statement defending its procedures. [[NPR]] quoted [[University of Denver]] [[Sturm College of Law]] professor [[J. Robert Brown, Jr.|Jay Brown]] as saying: \"My initial take on this is it's a tempest in a teapot,\" and [[Jacob Frenkel]], a securities lawyer in the Washington, D.C., area, as saying in effect \"there's no allegation the SEC tossed sensitive documents from banks it got under subpoena in high-profile cases that investors and lawmakers care about\". NPR concluded its report:\n\n<blockquote>The debate boils down to this: What does an investigative record mean to Congress? And the courts? Under the law, those investigative records must be kept for 25 years. But federal officials say no judge has ruled that papers related to early-stage SEC inquiries are investigative records. The SEC's inspector general says he's conducting a thorough investigation into the allegations. [Kotz] tells NPR that he'll issue a report by the end of September.<ref>Johnson, Carrie, [https://www.npr.org/2011/08/18/139758303/sec-documents-destroyed-employee-tells-congress \"SEC Documents Destroyed, Employee Tells Congress\"], National Public Radio (transcript and audio), August 18, 2011.

The FTC regulates general business practices, while the SEC focuses on the securities markets.\n\nThe [[Temporary National Economic Committee]] was established by joint resolution of Congress 52 Stat. 705 on June 16, 1938. It was in charge of reporting to Congress on abuses of monopoly power. The committee was defunded in 1941, but its records are still under seal by order of the SEC.<ref name=\"tnec\">{{cite web|url=https://www.archives.gov/research/guide-fed-records/groups/144.html |title=National Archives |publisher=Archives.gov |accessdate=March 1, 2013}}</ref>\n\nThe [[Municipal Securities Rulemaking Board]] (MSRB) was established in 1975 by Congress to develop rules for companies involved in [[underwriting]] and trading [[Municipal bond|municipal securities]].  The MSRB is monitored by the SEC, but the MSRB does not have the authority to enforce its rules.\n\nWhile most violations of securities laws are enforced by the SEC and the various SROs it monitors, state securities regulators can also enforce statewide securities blue sky laws.<ref name=\"bluesky\"/> States may require securities to be registered in the state before they can be sold there. [[National Securities Markets Improvement Act of 1996]] (NSMIA) addressed this dual system of federal-state regulation by amending Section 18 of the 1933 Act to exempt nationally traded securities from state registration, thereby pre-empting state law in this area.  However, NSMIA preserves the states' anti-fraud authority over all securities traded in the state.<ref name=\"nsmia\">{{cite web|url=http://www.accreditedinvestors.net/national-securities-markets-improvement-act/|title=National Securities Markets Improvement Act|publisher=AccreditedInvestors.net}}</ref>\n\nThe SEC also works with federal and state law enforcement agencies to carry out actions against actors alleged to be in violation of the securities laws.\n\nThe SEC is a member of [[International Organization of Securities Commissions]] (IOSCO), and uses the IOSCO Multilateral Memorandum of Understanding as well as direct bilateral agreements with other countries' [[securities commission]]s to deal with cross-border misconduct in securities markets.\n\n==Related legislation==\n* 1933: [[Securities Act of 1933]]\n* 1934: [[Securities Exchange Act of 1934]]\n* 1938: [[Temporary National Economic Committee]] (establishment)\n* 1939: [[Trust Indenture Act of 1939]]\n* 1940: [[Investment Advisers Act of 1940]]\n* 1940: [[Investment Company Act of 1940]]\n* 1968: [[Williams Act]] (Securities Disclosure Act)\n* 1982: [[Garn\u2013St. Germain Depository Institutions Act]]\n* 1999: [[Gramm\u2013Leach\u2013Bliley Act]]\n* 2000: [[Commodity Futures Modernization Act of 2000]]\n* 2002: [[Sarbanes\u2013Oxley Act]]\n* 2003: [[Fair and Accurate Credit Transactions Act]] of 2003\n* 2006: [[Credit Rating Agency Reform Act]] of 2006\n* 2010: [[Dodd\u2013Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act]]\n* 2012: [[Volcker Rule]] (a specific section of the Dodd\u2013Frank Act)\n* [[Title 17 of the Code of Federal Regulations]]\n\n==See also==\n* [[Chicago Stock Exchange]]\n* [[Financial regulation]]\n* [[List of financial regulatory authorities by country]]\n* [[Regulation D (SEC)]]\n* [[Securities regulation in the United States]]\n* [[Securities market participants (United States)]]\n\n=== Forms ===\n* [[SEC filing]]\n** [[Form 4]] (stock and stock options ownership and exercise disclosure)\n** [[Form 8-K]]\n** [[Form 10-K]]\n** [[Form 10-Q]]\n** [[Form S-1]] ([[Initial Public Offering|IPO]])\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n== External links ==\n{{commons category|United States Securities and Exchange Commission}}\n<!--===============================================================================-->\n<!--| WIKIPEDIA IS NOT A COLLECTION OF LINKS.

The SEC was created by Section 4 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (now codified as {{usc|15|78d}} and commonly referred to as the Exchange Act or the 1934 Act).\n\n==Overview==\n{{more citations needed section|date=February 2017}}\n\nThe SEC has a three-part mission: to protect investors; maintain fair, orderly, and efficient markets; and facilitate capital formation.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://investor.gov/introduction-markets/role-sec|title=The Role of the SEC|last=|first=|date=|website=Investor.gov|publisher=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\nTo achieve its mandate, the SEC enforces the statutory requirement that [[public company|public companies]] and other regulated companies submit quarterly and [[annual report]]s, as well as other periodic reports. In addition to annual [[financial statements|financial reports]], company executives must provide a narrative account, called the \"[[management discussion and analysis]]\" (MD&A), that outlines the previous year of operations and explains how the company fared in that time period. MD&A will usually also touch on the upcoming year, outlining future goals and approaches to new projects. In an attempt to level the playing field for all investors, the SEC maintains an online database called [[EDGAR]] (the Electronic Data Gathering, Analysis, and Retrieval system) [[online and offline|online]] from which investors can access this and other information filed with the agency.\n\nQuarterly and semiannual reports from public companies are crucial for investors to make sound decisions when investing in the capital markets. Unlike [[bank]]ing, [[investment]] in the capital markets is not [[Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation|guaranteed]] by the federal government. The potential for big gains needs to be weighed against that of sizable losses. Mandatory disclosure of financial and other information about the issuer and the security itself gives private individuals as well as large institutions the same basic facts about the public companies they invest in, thereby increasing public scrutiny while reducing insider trading and [[fraud]].\n\nThe SEC makes reports available to the public through the EDGAR system. The SEC also offers publications on investment-related topics for public education. The same online system also takes tips and complaints from investors to help the SEC track down violators of the securities laws. The SEC adheres to a strict policy of never commenting on the existence or status of an ongoing investigation.\n\n==History==\nPrior to the enactment of the federal securities laws and the creation of the SEC, there existed so-called [[blue sky law]]s.  They were enacted and enforced at the state level and regulated the offering and sale of securities to protect the public from fraud. Though the specific provisions of these laws varied among states, they all required the registration of all securities offerings and sales, as well as of every U.S. [[stockbroker]] and brokerage firm.<ref name=\"bluesky\">{{cite web|url=http://www.seclaw.com/bluesky.htm |title=Blue Sky laws |publisher=Seclaw.com |date=July 7, 2007 |accessdate=March 1, 2013}}</ref>\n\nHowever, these blue sky laws were generally found to be ineffective. For example, the Investment Bankers Association told its members as early as 1915 that they could \"ignore\" blue sky laws by making securities offerings across state lines through the mail.<ref name=\"transwall\">{{cite book|first=Joel|last=Seligman|title=The Transformation of Wall Street|pages=45, 51\u201352|publisher=Aspen|year=2003}}</ref> After holding hearings on abuses on interstate frauds (commonly known as the [[Pecora Commission]]), Congress passed the Securities Act of 1933 ({{usc|15|77a}}), which regulates interstate sales of securities ([[Primary market|original issues]]) at the federal level. The subsequent Securities Exchange Act of 1934 ({{usc|15|78d}}) regulates sales of securities in the [[secondary market]]. Section 4 of the 1934 act created the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission to enforce the federal securities laws; both laws are considered parts of [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]]'s [[New Deal]] raft of legislation.\n\n[[File:Joseph P. Kennedy, Sr. 1940.jpg|thumb|upright|left|[[Joseph P. Kennedy Sr.|Joseph P. Kennedy Sr]], the inaugural Chairman of the SEC]]\nThe Securities Act of 1933 is also known as the \"Truth in Securities Act\" and the \"Federal Securities Act\", or just the \"1933 Act\". Its goal was to increase public trust in the [[capital market]]s by requiring uniform disclosure of information about public securities offerings. The primary drafters of 1933 Act were Huston Thompson, a former [[Federal Trade Commission]] (FTC) chairman, and Walter Miller and Ollie Butler, two attorneys in the [[United States Department of Commerce|Commerce Department]]'s Foreign Service Division, with input from Supreme Court Justice [[Louis Brandeis]]. For the first year of the law's enactment, the enforcement of the statute rested with the Federal Trade Commission, but this power was transferred to the SEC following its creation in 1934.\n\nIn 1934, Roosevelt named his friend [[Joseph P. Kennedy]], a self-made multimillionaire  financier and a leader among the Irish-American community, as the insider-as-chairman who knew Wall Street well enough to clean it up.<ref>He was the father of president John F. Kennedy. David Nasaw, ''The Patriarch: The Remarkable Life and Turbulent Times of Joseph P. Kennedy'' (2012) pp 204-37.</ref> Two of the other five commissioners were [[James M. Landis]] (one of the architects of the 1934 Act and other New Deal legislation) and [[Ferdinand Pecora]] (Chief Counsel to the Senate Committee on Banking and Currency during its investigation of Wall Street banking and stock brokerage practices). Kennedy added a number of intelligent young lawyers, including [[William O. Douglas]] and [[Abe Fortas]], both of whom later became Supreme Court justices. Kennedy's team defined the mission and operating mode for the SEC, making full use of its wide range of legal powers. The SEC had four missions. First and most important was to restore investor confidence in the securities market, which had practically collapsed because of doubts about its internal integrity, and fears of the external threats supposedly posed by anti-business elements in the Roosevelt administration. Second, in terms of integrity, the SEC had to get rid of the penny-ante swindles based on fake information, fraudulent devices, and unsound get-rich-quick schemes. That unsavory element had to be prosecuted and shut down. Thirdly, and much more important than the outright frauds, the SEC had to end the million-dollar insider maneuvers by top officials of major corporations, whereby insiders with access to much better information about the condition of the company knew when to buy or sell their own securities. A crackdown on insider trading was given high priority. Finally, the SEC had to set up a complex system of registration for all securities sold in America, with a clear-cut set of deadlines, rules and guidelines that everyone had to follow. Drafting precise rules was the main challenge faced by the bright young lawyers. The SEC succeeded in its four missions, as Kennedy reassured the American business community that they would no longer be deceived and tricked and taken advantage of by Wall Street. He became a cheerleader for ordinary investors to return to the market and enable the economy to grow again.<ref>Nassau, ''The Patriarch,'' pp. 226\u201328</ref>\n\nThe law requires that issuing companies register distributions of securities with the SEC prior to interstate sales of these securities, so that investors may have access to basic financial information about issuing companies and risks involved in investing in the securities in question. Since 1994, most registration statements (and associated materials) filed with the SEC can be accessed via the SEC's online system, EDGAR.<ref name=\"Act1933\">{{cite web|url=https://www.sec.gov/about/laws/sa33.pdf |title=Securities Act of 1933 |accessdate=March 1, 2013}}</ref>\n\nThe Securities Exchange Act of 1934 is also known as \"the Exchange Act\" or \"the 1934 Act\". This act regulates secondary trading between individuals and companies which are often unrelated to the original issuers of securities. Entities under the SEC's authority include securities exchanges with physical trading floors such as the [[New York Stock Exchange]] (NYSE), [[self-regulatory organization]]s (SROs) such as the [[Financial Industry Regulatory Authority|National Association of Securities Dealers]] (NASD), the [[Municipal Securities Rulemaking Board]] (MSRB), online trading platforms such as the [[NASDAQ|NASDAQ Stock Market]] (NASDAQ) and [[alternative trading system]]s (ATSs), and any other persons (''e.g.'', securities brokers) engaged in transactions for the accounts of others.<ref name=\"Act1934\">{{cite web|url=https://www.sec.gov/about/laws/sea34.pdf |title=Securities Exchange Act of 1934 |accessdate=March 1, 2013}}</ref>\n \nLater SEC commissioners and chairmen include [[William O. Douglas]], [[Jerome Frank (lawyer)|Jerome Frank]] (one of the leaders of the [[legal realism]] movement), and [[William J. Casey]] (who later headed the [[Central Intelligence Agency]] under President [[Ronald Reagan]]).\n\nIn 2019, the Securities and Exchange Commission Historical Society introduced an online gallery to illustrate changes in the US securities market structure since the1930s. The online gallery features a narrative history supported by dozens of documents, papers, interviews, photos and videos.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.historyassociates.com/who-we-are/press-releases/securities-market-structure-exhibit/|title=History Associates Details the Evolution of Securities Market Structure in New Online Exhibit |publisher=History Associates |accessdate=28 April 2019}}</ref>\n\n==Organizational structure==\n\n===Commission members===\n{{main|Securities and Exchange Commission appointees}}\n\nThe Commission has five Commissioners who are appointed by the President of the United States. The commission is kept [[nonpartisan|Non-partisan]] as no more than three Commissioners may belong to the same political party. Their terms last five years and are staggered so that one commissioner's term ends on June 5 of each year. Service may continue up to eighteen additional months past term expiration.\n\nThe President also designates one of the Commissioners as Chairman, the SEC's top executive. However, the President does not possess the power to fire the appointed Commissioners, a provision that was made to ensure the independence of the SEC. This issue arose during the [[John McCain 2008 presidential campaign|2008 presidential election]] in connection with the [[Global financial crisis of 2008\u20132009|ensuing financial crises]].\n\nCurrently, the SEC Commissioners are:<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.sec.gov/about/commissioner.shtml |title=Current SEC Commissioners |publisher=Sec.gov |date=December 17, 2012 |accessdate=March 1, 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://citywireusa.com/registered-investment-advisor/news/senate-confirms-allison-herren-lee-to-sec-post/a1243288|last=Wenik |first=Ian |date=June 21, 2019|title=Senate confirms Allison Herren Lee to SEC post|work= [[Citywire]]|accessdate=June 21, 2019}}</ref>\n\n{|class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|-\n!

The division is also responsible for operating EDGAR.\n\nThe '''Trading and Markets''' division oversees self-regulatory organizations such as the [[Financial Industry Regulatory Authority]] (FINRA) and [[Municipal Securities Rulemaking Board]] (MSRB) and all [[broker-dealer]] firms and [[investment banking|investment houses]]. This division also interprets proposed changes to regulations and monitors operations of the industry. In practice, the SEC delegates most of its enforcement and rulemaking authority to FINRA. In fact, all trading firms not regulated by other SROs must register as a member of FINRA. Individuals trading securities must pass exams administered by FINRA to become [[General Securities Representative Exam|registered representatives]].<ref name=\"finra\">{{cite web|url=http://www.finra.com |title=National Association of Securities Dealers |publisher=Finra.com |accessdate=March 1, 2013}}</ref><ref name=\"nasdSec\">\"How does the NASD differ from the SEC?\" Investopedia.

These entities are subject to extensive regulation under various federal securities laws.<ref>Lemke and Lins, ''Regulation of Investment Advisers'' (Thomson West, 2013 ed.); Lemke, Lins and Smith, ''Regulation of Investment Companies'' (Matthew Bender, 2013 ed.).</ref> The Division of Investment Management administers various federal securities laws, in particular, the Investment Company Act of 1940 and Investment Advisers Act of 1940.

The SEC generally conducts investigations in private.  The SEC's staff may seek voluntary production of documents and testimony, or may seek a formal order of investigation from the SEC, which allows the staff to compel the production of documents and witness testimony. The SEC can bring a [[lawsuit|civil action]] in a [[United States district court|U.S. District Court]], or an [[administrative proceeding]] which is heard by an independent [[administrative law judge]] (ALJ). The SEC does not have criminal authority but may refer matters to state and federal prosecutors. The director of the SEC's Enforcement Division  [[Robert Khuzami]] left the office in February 2013.<ref>{{cite news|last=Protess |first=Ben |url=https://dealbook.nytimes.com/2013/02/11/s-e-c-s-revolving-door-hurts-its-effectiveness-report-says/ |title=S.E.C.'s Revolving Door Hurts Its Effectiveness, Report Says |publisher=Dealbook.nytimes.com |accessdate=March 1, 2013 |date=February 11, 2013}}</ref>\n\nThe '''Economic and Risk Analysis''' Division (DERA) was created in September 2009 to integrate financial economics and rigorous data analytics into the core mission of the SEC. The Division is involved across the entire range of SEC activities, including policy-making, rule-making, enforcement, and examination. As the agency's \"think tank,\" DERA relies on a variety of academic disciplines, quantitative and non-quantitative approaches, and knowledge of market institutions and practices to help the Commission approach complex matters in a fresh light. DERA also assists in the Commission's efforts to identify, analyze, and respond to risks and trends, including those associated with new financial products and strategies. Through the range and nature of its activities, DERA serves the critical function of promoting collaborative efforts throughout the agency and breaking through silos that might otherwise limit the impact of the agency's institutional expertise. The Division's activities include providing detailed, high-quality economic and statistical analyses, and specific subject-matter expertise to the Commission and other Divisions/Offices and developing customized, analytic tools and analyses to proactively detect market risks indicative of possible violations of the Federal securities laws. Using data, DERA staff create analytic programs designed to detect patterns identifying risks, enabling Commission divisions and offices to deploy scarce resources targeting possible misconduct. DERA also houses the Commission's Chief Economist.{{citation needed|date=August 2019}}\n\n===Regional offices===\n11 regional offices throughout the US with the name of the regional director.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.sec.gov/page/sec-regional-offices|title=SEC Regional Offices|work=U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission|accessdate=June 12, 2019}}</ref>\n\n{{div-col|colwidth=18em|content=\n*Atlanta ~ Richard Best\n*Denver ~ Kurt Gottschall\n*Miami ~ Eric I.

The documents included those relating to \"[[Matters Under Inquiry]]\", or MUI, the name the SEC gives to the first stages of the investigation process. The tradition of destruction began as early as the 1990s. This SEC activity eventually caused a conflict with the [[National Archives and Records Administration]] when it was revealed to them in 2010 by Flynn. Flynn also described a meeting at the SEC in which top staff discussed ''refusing to admit the destruction had taken place, because it was possibly illegal''.<ref name=taibi20118/>\n\nIowa Republican Senator [[Charles Grassley]], among others, took note of Flynn's call for protection as a whistleblower, and the story of the agency's document-handling procedures. The SEC issued a statement defending its procedures. [[NPR]] quoted [[University of Denver]] [[Sturm College of Law]] professor [[J. Robert Brown, Jr.|Jay Brown]] as saying: \"My initial take on this is it's a tempest in a teapot,\" and [[Jacob Frenkel]], a securities lawyer in the Washington, D.C., area, as saying in effect \"there's no allegation the SEC tossed sensitive documents from banks it got under subpoena in high-profile cases that investors and lawmakers care about\". NPR concluded its report:\n\n<blockquote>The debate boils down to this: What does an investigative record mean to Congress? And the courts? Under the law, those investigative records must be kept for 25 years. But federal officials say no judge has ruled that papers related to early-stage SEC inquiries are investigative records. The SEC's inspector general says he's conducting a thorough investigation into the allegations. [Kotz] tells NPR that he'll issue a report by the end of September.<ref>Johnson, Carrie, [https://www.npr.org/2011/08/18/139758303/sec-documents-destroyed-employee-tells-congress \"SEC Documents Destroyed, Employee Tells Congress\"], National Public Radio (transcript and audio), August 18, 2011.

The Securities Exchange Act of 1934 transferred this responsibility from the FTC to the SEC. The main mission of the FTC is to promote consumer protection and to eradicate [[anti-competitive practices|anti-competitive business practices]]. The FTC regulates general business practices, while the SEC focuses on the securities markets.\n\nThe [[Temporary National Economic Committee]] was established by joint resolution of Congress 52 Stat. 705 on June 16, 1938. It was in charge of reporting to Congress on abuses of monopoly power. The committee was defunded in 1941, but its records are still under seal by order of the SEC.<ref name=\"tnec\">{{cite web|url=https://www.archives.gov/research/guide-fed-records/groups/144.html |title=National Archives |publisher=Archives.gov |accessdate=March 1, 2013}}</ref>\n\nThe [[Municipal Securities Rulemaking Board]] (MSRB) was established in 1975 by Congress to develop rules for companies involved in [[underwriting]] and trading [[Municipal bond|municipal securities]].  The MSRB is monitored by the SEC, but the MSRB does not have the authority to enforce its rules.\n\nWhile most violations of securities laws are enforced by the SEC and the various SROs it monitors, state securities regulators can also enforce statewide securities blue sky laws.<ref name=\"bluesky\"/> States may require securities to be registered in the state before they can be sold there. [[National Securities Markets Improvement Act of 1996]] (NSMIA) addressed this dual system of federal-state regulation by amending Section 18 of the 1933 Act to exempt nationally traded securities from state registration, thereby pre-empting state law in this area.  However, NSMIA preserves the states' anti-fraud authority over all securities traded in the state.<ref name=\"nsmia\">{{cite web|url=http://www.accreditedinvestors.net/national-securities-markets-improvement-act/|title=National Securities Markets Improvement Act|publisher=AccreditedInvestors.net}}</ref>\n\nThe SEC also works with federal and state law enforcement agencies to carry out actions against actors alleged to be in violation of the securities laws.\n\nThe SEC is a member of [[International Organization of Securities Commissions]] (IOSCO), and uses the IOSCO Multilateral Memorandum of Understanding as well as direct bilateral agreements with other countries' [[securities commission]]s to deal with cross-border misconduct in securities markets.\n\n==Related legislation==\n* 1933: [[Securities Act of 1933]]\n* 1934: [[Securities Exchange Act of 1934]]\n* 1938: [[Temporary National Economic Committee]] (establishment)\n* 1939: [[Trust Indenture Act of 1939]]\n* 1940: [[Investment Advisers Act of 1940]]\n* 1940: [[Investment Company Act of 1940]]\n* 1968: [[Williams Act]] (Securities Disclosure Act)\n* 1982: [[Garn\u2013St. Germain Depository Institutions Act]]\n* 1999: [[Gramm\u2013Leach\u2013Bliley Act]]\n* 2000: [[Commodity Futures Modernization Act of 2000]]\n* 2002: [[Sarbanes\u2013Oxley Act]]\n* 2003: [[Fair and Accurate Credit Transactions Act]] of 2003\n* 2006: [[Credit Rating Agency Reform Act]] of 2006\n* 2010: [[Dodd\u2013Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act]]\n* 2012: [[Volcker Rule]] (a specific section of the Dodd\u2013Frank Act)\n* [[Title 17 of the Code of Federal Regulations]]\n\n==See also==\n* [[Chicago Stock Exchange]]\n* [[Financial regulation]]\n* [[List of financial regulatory authorities by country]]\n* [[Regulation D (SEC)]]\n* [[Securities regulation in the United States]]\n* [[Securities market participants (United States)]]\n\n=== Forms ===\n* [[SEC filing]]\n** [[Form 4]] (stock and stock options ownership and exercise disclosure)\n** [[Form 8-K]]\n** [[Form 10-K]]\n** [[Form 10-Q]]\n** [[Form S-1]] ([[Initial Public Offering|IPO]])\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n== External links ==\n{{commons category|United States Securities and Exchange Commission}}\n<!--===============================================================================-->\n<!--| WIKIPEDIA IS NOT A COLLECTION OF LINKS.

It was incorporated as '''Apple Computer, Inc.''', in January 1977, and sales of its computers, including the [[Apple II]], grew quickly. Within a few years, Jobs and Wozniak had hired a staff of computer designers and had a production line. Apple [[initial public offering|went public]] in 1980 to instant financial success. Over the next few years, Apple shipped new computers featuring innovative [[graphical user interface]]s, such as the [[Macintosh 128K|original Macintosh]] in 1984, and Apple's marketing advertisements for its products received widespread critical acclaim. However, the high price of its products and limited application library caused problems, as did power struggles between executives. In 1985, Wozniak departed Apple amicably and remained an honorary employee,<ref name=\"wozemployee\">{{Cite news |url= http://woz.org/letters/never-left-apple/ |title= I Never Left Apple |date= January 3, 2018 |work= Officially Woz |access-date= October 2, 2018 |language= en-US}}</ref> while Jobs and others resigned to found [[NeXT]].<ref name=\"rice19850415\" />\n\nAs the market for personal computers expanded and evolved through the 1990s, Apple lost market share to the lower-priced duopoly of [[Microsoft Windows]] on [[Intel]] PC clones. The board recruited [[CEO]] [[Gil Amelio]] to what would be a 500-day charge for him to rehabilitate the financially troubled company\u2014reshaping it with layoffs, executive restructuring, and product focus. In 1997, he led Apple to buy NeXT, solving the desperately failed operating system strategy and bringing Jobs back. Jobs pensively regained leadership status, becoming CEO in 2000. Apple swiftly returned to profitability under the revitalizing [[Think different]] campaign, as he rebuilt Apple's status by launching the [[iMac G3|iMac]] in 1998, opening the retail chain of [[Apple Store]]s in 2001, and acquiring numerous companies to broaden the software portfolio. In January 2007, Jobs renamed the company Apple Inc., reflecting its shifted focus toward consumer electronics, and launched the [[iPhone]] to great critical acclaim and financial success. In August 2011, Jobs resigned as CEO due to health complications, and [[Tim Cook]] became the new CEO. Two months later, Jobs died, marking the end of an era for the company. In June 2019, [[Jony Ive]], Apple's [[Chief design officer|CDO]], left the company to start his own firm but stated he would work with Apple as its primary client.\n\nApple is well known for its size and revenues.

Although some worried about pricing themselves out of the market, the high-right policy was in full force by the mid-1980s, notably due to Jean-Louis Gass\u00e9e's mantra of \"fifty-five or die\", referring to the 55% [[profit margin]]s of the [[Macintosh II]].<ref name=insidestoryCarlton>{{Cite book |last= Carlton |first= Jim |year= 1997 |title= Apple: The inside story of intrigue, egomania, and business blunders |location= New York |publisher= [[Random House]] |isbn= 978-0-8129-2851-8 |url= https://archive.org/details/appleinsidestory00carl}}</ref>{{Rp|79\u201380}} Selling Macintosh at such high profit margins was only possible because of its dominant position in the desktop publishing market.<ref>{{Cite book |ref={{SfnRef|Swaine|2014}}|first=Michael |last=Swaine |year=2014 |title=Fire in the Valley: The Birth and Death of the Personal Computer |publisher=Pragmatic Bookshelf |isbn=9781680503524}} pp. 359\u2013363</ref>\n\nThis policy began to backfire in the last years of the decade as new desktop publishing programs appeared on [[IBM PC compatible|PC clones]] that offered some or much of the same functionality of the Macintosh but at far lower price points. The company lost its monopoly in this market and had already estranged many of its original consumer customer base who could no longer afford their high-priced products.

[[Ferdinand de Saussure]], a Swiss linguist and [[semiotician]], created a semiotic model that identifies two parts of a sign: the [[signified and signifier]]. The signifier is the perceptual component that we physically see, and the signified is then the concept which the sign refers to. In Saussure\u2019s model, the sign results from the recognition of a sound or object with a concept. In his model, the signified and signifier are \u201cas inseparable as two sides of a piece of paper\".<ref name=Chandler>{{cite book|last1=Chandler|first1=Daniel|title=Semiotics: The Basics|date=2018|publisher=Routledge|location=New York, NY|edition=3rd}}</ref> The second popular semiotic model that exists is the Peircean Model. [[Charles Sanders Pierce]] was a logician. His model, like Saussure\u2019s model, involved the relationship between the elements of signs and objects. However, the Peircean model added that whoever is decoding the sign must have some previous understanding or knowledge about the transmitted message.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Parmentier |first1=Richard |title=Signs in society: Studies in semiotic anthropology |date=1994 |publisher=Indiana University Press |isbn=0253327571}}</ref> Peirce\u2019s model can be represented using the three sides of triangle: the [[representamen]] (the sign), an object (what the sign represents), and the [[interpretant]] (the produced effect by the sign).<ref name=Chandler/>\n\nThe symbolic representation that a [[brand]] carries can affect how a [[consumer]] \u201crecalls, internalizes, and relates\u201d to the performance of a company. There is plenty of evidence to show that a company can easily fail if they do not keep track of how the brand changes with the [[media culture]]. Semiotic research can be used to help a company relate to their customer\u2019s culture over time and help their brand to stand out in competitive markets.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Oswald |first1=L. |title=The structural semiotics paradigm for marketing research: theory, methodology, and case analysis. |journal=Semiotica |date=2015 |volume=205 |doi= 10.1515/sem-2015-0005}}</ref>\n\nThe first two Apple logos are drastically different from each other. However, they both share the sign of an apple. In the original logo designed by [[Ronald Wayne]], [[Sir Isaac Newton]] is seen sitting under the infamous apple tree about to bear fruit above, just before his discovery of gravity. When one analyzes the [[semiotics]] with Saussure\u2019s model, the signified, or sign, is the apple. The signifier represents discovery, innovation, and the notion of thought.<ref name=SlideShare>{{cite web|last1=Rohan|first1=R.|title=Semiotics Analysis of Apple Inc.

The company\u2019s mission was, and still is, to simplify technology for the everyday life. A fun and clever logo that spoke to computer-savvy people was needed. In 1977, [[Rob Janoff]] created the iconic rainbow apple symbol that is still recognized today. The logo had double meaning and differed from the many serious logos in existence at the time.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Linzmayer, O. |first1=Owen |title=Apple confidential 2.0: The definitive history of the world\u2019s most colorful company. |date=2004 |publisher=No Starch Press |isbn=1593270100 |edition=2nd}}</ref>\n\nApple Inc. is well known for being an innovative company who challenge the status quo and established standards. Again, using Saussure\u2019s semiotic model, the signified, is an apple, but with a bite taken out of it. Because Apple is seen as a \u201cchallenger\u201d in the industry, the most common signifier is the forbidden fruit from the Biblical reference, the Garden of Eden.<ref name=Cowin>{{cite web|last1=Cowin|first1=E.|title=The evolution of U.S. corporate logos a semiotic analysis|url=http://stars.library.ucf.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=3024&context=etd|accessdate=27 March 2020}}</ref> The signified is the bite from the apple, and the represented signifier is the tree of knowledge. Thus, symbolizing Apple as a \u201crebellious young company\u201d ready to challenge the world.<ref name=SlideShare/> An even further semiotic analysis is that Adam and Eve gained a great deal of knowledge after the apple was bitten. So, the bitten apple is a sign for the \u201cpromise of knowledge\u201d that an Apple user may gain from the product.\n\nThe [[semiotics]] of the bite and the color of the logo can also be looked at from a technologic viewpoint. The bite is the [[signified]] and the computer storage unit, [[byte]], is the [[signifier]]. The rainbow color of the logo portrays the message that the its [[computer monitor]] could be produce color images.<ref name=SlideShare/> [[Steve Jobs]] also argued that color was crucial for \u201chumanizing the company\u201d at that time.<ref name=Cowin/>\n\nThe only thing to change with the logo since 1977 has been the color. In 1998, a [[monochromatic]] logo was implemented with the release of the first [[iMac]]. This was the first Mac to not have the iconic rainbow-colored apple since its creation 20 years prior.<ref name=Biricik>{{cite web|last1=Biricik|first1=Asli|title=The role of logo design in creating brand emotion: A semiotic comparison of the Apple and IBM logos|url=http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.427.5285&rep=rep1&type=pdf|accessdate=27 March 2020}}</ref> The new look was the future or new era of Apple Inc.

He goes on to write that the criticism focuses on individual pieces of hardware rather than the ecosystem as a whole, stating \"Yes, iteration is boring. But it's also how Apple does business. [...] It enters a new market and then refines and refines and continues refining until it yields a success\". He acknowledges that people are wishing for the \"excitement of revolution\", but argues that people want \"the comfort that comes with harmony\". Furthermore, he writes that \"a device is only the starting point of an experience that will ultimately be ruled by the ecosystem in which it was spawned\", referring to how decent hardware products can still fail without a proper ecosystem (specifically mentioning that [[Walkman]] didn't have an ecosystem to keep users from leaving once something better came along), but how Apple devices in different hardware segments are able to communicate and cooperate through the [[iCloud]] cloud service with features including Universal Clipboard (in which text copied on one device can be pasted on a different device) as well as inter-connected device functionality including Auto Unlock (in which an [[Apple Watch]] can unlock a [[Macintosh|Mac]] in close proximity).

Whereas [[Google]] and [[Amazon (company)|Amazon]] make use of [[big data]] and analyze customer information to personalize results, Apple has a strong [[Apple Inc.#Privacy stance|pro-privacy stance]], intentionally not retaining user data. \"Siri is a textbook of [[iPhone|leading on something in tech]] and then losing an edge despite having all the money and the talent and sitting in Silicon Valley\", Holger Mueller, a technology analyst, told the ''Journal''. The report further claims that development on Siri has suffered due to team members and executives leaving the company for competitors, a lack of ambitious goals, and shifting strategies. Though switching Siri's functions to [[machine learning]] and [[algorithm]]s, which dramatically cut its error rate, the company reportedly still failed to anticipate the popularity of Amazon's [[Amazon Echo|Echo]], which features the [[Amazon Alexa|Alexa]] personal assistant.

It was incorporated as '''Apple Computer, Inc.''', in January 1977, and sales of its computers, including the [[Apple II]], grew quickly. Within a few years, Jobs and Wozniak had hired a staff of computer designers and had a production line. Apple [[initial public offering|went public]] in 1980 to instant financial success. Over the next few years, Apple shipped new computers featuring innovative [[graphical user interface]]s, such as the [[Macintosh 128K|original Macintosh]] in 1984, and Apple's marketing advertisements for its products received widespread critical acclaim. However, the high price of its products and limited application library caused problems, as did power struggles between executives. In 1985, Wozniak departed Apple amicably and remained an honorary employee,<ref name=\"wozemployee\">{{Cite news |url= http://woz.org/letters/never-left-apple/ |title= I Never Left Apple |date= January 3, 2018 |work= Officially Woz |access-date= October 2, 2018 |language= en-US}}</ref> while Jobs and others resigned to found [[NeXT]].<ref name=\"rice19850415\" />\n\nAs the market for personal computers expanded and evolved through the 1990s, Apple lost market share to the lower-priced duopoly of [[Microsoft Windows]] on [[Intel]] PC clones. The board recruited [[CEO]] [[Gil Amelio]] to what would be a 500-day charge for him to rehabilitate the financially troubled company\u2014reshaping it with layoffs, executive restructuring, and product focus. In 1997, he led Apple to buy NeXT, solving the desperately failed operating system strategy and bringing Jobs back. Jobs pensively regained leadership status, becoming CEO in 2000. Apple swiftly returned to profitability under the revitalizing [[Think different]] campaign, as he rebuilt Apple's status by launching the [[iMac G3|iMac]] in 1998, opening the retail chain of [[Apple Store]]s in 2001, and acquiring numerous companies to broaden the software portfolio. In January 2007, Jobs renamed the company Apple Inc., reflecting its shifted focus toward consumer electronics, and launched the [[iPhone]] to great critical acclaim and financial success. In August 2011, Jobs resigned as CEO due to health complications, and [[Tim Cook]] became the new CEO. Two months later, Jobs died, marking the end of an era for the company. In June 2019, [[Jony Ive]], Apple's [[Chief design officer|CDO]], left the company to start his own firm but stated he would work with Apple as its primary client.\n\nApple is well known for its size and revenues.

[[Ferdinand de Saussure]], a Swiss linguist and [[semiotician]], created a semiotic model that identifies two parts of a sign: the [[signified and signifier]]. The signifier is the perceptual component that we physically see, and the signified is then the concept which the sign refers to. In Saussure\u2019s model, the sign results from the recognition of a sound or object with a concept. In his model, the signified and signifier are \u201cas inseparable as two sides of a piece of paper\".<ref name=Chandler>{{cite book|last1=Chandler|first1=Daniel|title=Semiotics: The Basics|date=2018|publisher=Routledge|location=New York, NY|edition=3rd}}</ref> The second popular semiotic model that exists is the Peircean Model. [[Charles Sanders Pierce]] was a logician. His model, like Saussure\u2019s model, involved the relationship between the elements of signs and objects. However, the Peircean model added that whoever is decoding the sign must have some previous understanding or knowledge about the transmitted message.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Parmentier |first1=Richard |title=Signs in society: Studies in semiotic anthropology |date=1994 |publisher=Indiana University Press |isbn=0253327571}}</ref> Peirce\u2019s model can be represented using the three sides of triangle: the [[representamen]] (the sign), an object (what the sign represents), and the [[interpretant]] (the produced effect by the sign).<ref name=Chandler/>\n\nThe symbolic representation that a [[brand]] carries can affect how a [[consumer]] \u201crecalls, internalizes, and relates\u201d to the performance of a company. There is plenty of evidence to show that a company can easily fail if they do not keep track of how the brand changes with the [[media culture]]. Semiotic research can be used to help a company relate to their customer\u2019s culture over time and help their brand to stand out in competitive markets.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Oswald |first1=L. |title=The structural semiotics paradigm for marketing research: theory, methodology, and case analysis. |journal=Semiotica |date=2015 |volume=205 |doi= 10.1515/sem-2015-0005}}</ref>\n\nThe first two Apple logos are drastically different from each other. However, they both share the sign of an apple. In the original logo designed by [[Ronald Wayne]], [[Sir Isaac Newton]] is seen sitting under the infamous apple tree about to bear fruit above, just before his discovery of gravity. When one analyzes the [[semiotics]] with Saussure\u2019s model, the signified, or sign, is the apple. The signifier represents discovery, innovation, and the notion of thought.<ref name=SlideShare>{{cite web|last1=Rohan|first1=R.|title=Semiotics Analysis of Apple Inc.

The company\u2019s mission was, and still is, to simplify technology for the everyday life. A fun and clever logo that spoke to computer-savvy people was needed. In 1977, [[Rob Janoff]] created the iconic rainbow apple symbol that is still recognized today. The logo had double meaning and differed from the many serious logos in existence at the time.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Linzmayer, O. |first1=Owen |title=Apple confidential 2.0: The definitive history of the world\u2019s most colorful company. |date=2004 |publisher=No Starch Press |isbn=1593270100 |edition=2nd}}</ref>\n\nApple Inc. is well known for being an innovative company who challenge the status quo and established standards. Again, using Saussure\u2019s semiotic model, the signified, is an apple, but with a bite taken out of it. Because Apple is seen as a \u201cchallenger\u201d in the industry, the most common signifier is the forbidden fruit from the Biblical reference, the Garden of Eden.<ref name=Cowin>{{cite web|last1=Cowin|first1=E.|title=The evolution of U.S. corporate logos a semiotic analysis|url=http://stars.library.ucf.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=3024&context=etd|accessdate=27 March 2020}}</ref> The signified is the bite from the apple, and the represented signifier is the tree of knowledge. Thus, symbolizing Apple as a \u201crebellious young company\u201d ready to challenge the world.<ref name=SlideShare/> An even further semiotic analysis is that Adam and Eve gained a great deal of knowledge after the apple was bitten. So, the bitten apple is a sign for the \u201cpromise of knowledge\u201d that an Apple user may gain from the product.\n\nThe [[semiotics]] of the bite and the color of the logo can also be looked at from a technologic viewpoint. The bite is the [[signified]] and the computer storage unit, [[byte]], is the [[signifier]]. The rainbow color of the logo portrays the message that the its [[computer monitor]] could be produce color images.<ref name=SlideShare/> [[Steve Jobs]] also argued that color was crucial for \u201chumanizing the company\u201d at that time.<ref name=Cowin/>\n\nThe only thing to change with the logo since 1977 has been the color. In 1998, a [[monochromatic]] logo was implemented with the release of the first [[iMac]].

He goes on to write that the criticism focuses on individual pieces of hardware rather than the ecosystem as a whole, stating \"Yes, iteration is boring. But it's also how Apple does business. [...] It enters a new market and then refines and refines and continues refining until it yields a success\". He acknowledges that people are wishing for the \"excitement of revolution\", but argues that people want \"the comfort that comes with harmony\". Furthermore, he writes that \"a device is only the starting point of an experience that will ultimately be ruled by the ecosystem in which it was spawned\", referring to how decent hardware products can still fail without a proper ecosystem (specifically mentioning that [[Walkman]] didn't have an ecosystem to keep users from leaving once something better came along), but how Apple devices in different hardware segments are able to communicate and cooperate through the [[iCloud]] cloud service with features including Universal Clipboard (in which text copied on one device can be pasted on a different device) as well as inter-connected device functionality including Auto Unlock (in which an [[Apple Watch]] can unlock a [[Macintosh|Mac]] in close proximity).

Whereas [[Google]] and [[Amazon (company)|Amazon]] make use of [[big data]] and analyze customer information to personalize results, Apple has a strong [[Apple Inc.#Privacy stance|pro-privacy stance]], intentionally not retaining user data. \"Siri is a textbook of [[iPhone|leading on something in tech]] and then losing an edge despite having all the money and the talent and sitting in Silicon Valley\", Holger Mueller, a technology analyst, told the ''Journal''. The report further claims that development on Siri has suffered due to team members and executives leaving the company for competitors, a lack of ambitious goals, and shifting strategies.
