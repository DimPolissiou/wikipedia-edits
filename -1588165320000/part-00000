{"title_page": "History of Thessaloniki", "text_new": "[[File:Thessaloniki historic city centre.svg|thumb|The historical center of Thessaloniki, with monuments from the city's Hellenistic, Roman, Byzantine and Ottoman past.]]\n\nThe '''history of the city of [[Thessaloniki]]''' is a long one, dating back to the ancient Greeks (Macedonians). Today with the opening of borders in Southeastern Europe it is currently experiencing a strong revival, serving as the prime port for the northern Greek regions of [[Macedonia (Greece)|Macedonia]] and [[Thrace]], as well as for the whole of [[Southeastern Europe]].\n\n==Hellenistic era==\n{{further|Ancient Greece|Hellenistic Greece}}\n[[File:Coin of Cassander.jpg|thumb|180px|Coin depicting [[Cassander]], founder of Thessalonica]]\n[[File:The Derveni krater, late 4th century B.C., side A, Dionysus and Ariadne, Archaeological Museum, Thessaloniki, Greece (7457851940).jpg|thumb|180px|left|Macedonian-era crater at the [[Archaeological Museum of Thessaloniki]].]]\n\nThe town was founded around 315 BC by [[Cassander|King Cassander of Macedon]], on or near the site of the ancient town of [[Therma]] and twenty-six other local villages. [[Cassander|King Cassander of Macedon]] named the new city after his wife [[Thessalonice of Macedon|Thessalonike]], a half-sister of [[Alexander the Great]]. She gained her name (\"victory of Thessalians\", from [[Greek Language|Greek]]: ''[[Nike (mythology)|nik\u0113]]'' \"victory\") from her father, [[Philip II of Macedon|Philip II]], to commemorate her birth on the day of his gaining a victory over the [[Phocians]], who were defeated with the help of [[Thessalian]] horsemen, the best in Greece at that time. Thessaloniki developed rapidly and as early as the 2nd century BC, it had its first walls built, which enclosed and protected the city. The city also came to be an autonomous part of the Kingdom of [[Macedon]], with its own parliament where a King was represented that could interfere in the city's domestic affairs.\n\n==Roman era==\n{{further|Roman Greece}}\n[[File:Thessaloniki-Arch of Galerius (eastern face).jpg|thumb|The [[Arch of Galerius and Rotunda|Arch of Galerius]] on [[Egnatia Street, Thessaloniki|Egnatia Street]]]]\n\nAfter the fall of the Kingdom of [[Macedon]] in 168 BC, Thessalonica as it came to be called in Latin, became a city of the [[Roman Republic]]. It grew to be an important trade-hub located on the [[Via Egnatia]], the [[Roman road]] connecting [[Byzantium]] (later [[Constantinople]]) with [[Epidamnos|Dyrrhachium]] (now [[Durr\u00ebs]] in [[Albania]]), which facilitated trade between Europe and Asia. The city became the capital of one of the four Roman districts of Macedonia while it kept its privileges but was ruled by a [[praetor]] and had a Roman garrison. Also for a short time in the 1st century BC, Thessalonica even became capital for all the Greek provinces. Due to the city's key commercial importance, a spacious harbour was built by the Romans, the famous ''Burrowed Harbour'' (\u03a3\u03ba\u03b1\u03c0\u03c4\u03cc\u03c2 \u039b\u03b9\u03bc\u03ae\u03bd) that accommodated the city's trade, up to the 18th century. Later, with the help of silt deposits from the [[Vardar|Axios]] river, land was reclaimed and the port was expanded. Remnants of the old harbour's docks can be found in present-day under Frangon Street, near the city's Catholic Church.\n\nThessaloniki's [[acropolis]], located in the northern hills, was built in 55 BC for security reasons, following [[Thracian]] raids in the city's outskirts at the time.\n \nAbout 50 AD, while on his second missionary journey, [[Paul the Apostle]] reasoned with the Jews from the [[Masoretic text|Scripture]]s in this city's chief synagogue on three Sabbaths and sowed the seeds for Thessaloniki's first Christian church. During Paul's time in the city, both Jews and Greeks came to believe the [[Gospel]], as well as some of the city's leading women. However, because the remaining Jews at the synagogue were furious with Paul for what he'd done in their community and were also furious with those who had come to believe Paul's message, the Apostle and his traveling companions, [[Silas]] and [[Saint Timothy|Timothy]], were eventually sent out of Thessaloniki during the night by the new Christian converts. From there the [[church planter]]s went to [[Veroia]], aka [[Berea (Bible)|Berea]], where the people in that city also heard and believed the Gospel. This so enraged the Thessalonian Jews when they found out what Paul and his companions had done, the Jews went to Berea and persecuted the evangelists in that city also. The three men eventually continued their travels and ministry; and, Paul wrote two [[Pauline epistles|letters]] to the new church at Thessaloniki, probably between 51 and 53, the [[First Epistle to the Thessalonians]] and the [[Second Epistle to the Thessalonians]]. These letters were to encourage the new believers to persist in the faith in the face of strong opposition, to encourage personal sanctification, to encourage them about those who had \"fallen asleep,\" yet to warn about the Lord returning as a \"thief in the night\" and to correct incorrect thinking about the coming [[Antichrist]], among writing about other important matters.<ref>\"The International Inductive Study Bible,\" NASV, Harvest House Publishers, Eugene, OR, 1993 Precept Ministries, pp.1933,1936-1938,1942,1944</ref>\n\nIn 306, Thessalon\u00edki acquired a patron saint, [[St. Demetrius]]. He is credited with a number of miracles that saved the city and was the Roman [[Proconsul]] of Greece, under the anti-Christian emperor [[Maximian]]. St. Demetrius was martyred at a Roman prison, where the [[Aghios Demetrios|Church of St. Demetrius]] lies today. The church was first built by the Roman [[Sub-prefecture|sub-prefect]] of [[Illyricum (Roman province)|Illyricum]], [[Leontios]], in 463. Other important remains from this period include the [[Arch and Tomb of Galerius]], located in the city centre of the modern [[Thessaloniki]].\n\nIn 390 Gothic troops under the commands of the Roman Emperor [[Theodosius I]], led a [[Massacre of Thessalonica|massacre]] against the inhabitants of Thessalonica, who had risen in revolt against the [[Germanic peoples|Germanic]] soldiers.\n\n==Byzantine era==\n{{further|Byzantine Greece|Medieval Thessalonica|Zealots of Thessalonica|Kingdom of Thessalonica|Empire of Thessalonica}}\n[[File:Saints Cyril and Methodius.jpg|thumb|left|180px|[[Saints Cyril and Methodius]].]]\n[[File:Agios Dimitrios1.jpg|thumb|The basilica of [[Hagios Demetrios]], patron saint of the city.]]\n[[Image:Agia Sofia front July 2006.jpg|thumb|The [[Hagia Sophia (Thessaloniki)|Church of Holy Wisdom]] (Hagia Sophia) in central Thessaloniki.]]\n[[File:Cristofano dell'altissimo, teodoro gaza, 1556 crop.JPG|thumb|180px|[[Theodorus Gaza]], also called by the epithet ''Thessalonicensis'' (Latin) and ''Thessalonikeus'' (Greek), was a humanist and translator of Aristotle.]]\n\nWhen the Roman [[Praetorian prefecture of Illyricum|Prefecture of Illyricum]] was divided between the East and West Roman Empires in 379, Thessaloniki became the capital of the new Prefecture of Illyricum (reduced in size). Its importance was second only to [[Constantinople]] itself, while in 390 it was the location of a revolt against the emperor [[Theodosius I]] and his Gothic mercenaries. [[Butheric]], their general, together with several of his high officials, were killed in an uprising triggered by the imprisoning of a favorite local charioteer for [[pederasty]] with one of Butheric's slave boys.<ref>Gibbon, ''The Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire,'' ch.27 2:56</ref> 7,000 - 15,000 of the citizens were [[Massacre of Thessaloniki|massacred]] in the city's hippodrome in revenge \u2013 an act which earned Theodosius a temporary excommunication.\n\nA quiet interlude followed until repeated barbarian invasions after the [[fall of the Roman Empire]], while a catastrophic earthquake severely damaged the city in 620, resulting in the destruction of the Roman Forum and several other public buildings. Thessaloniki itself came under attack from [[Slavs]] in the 7th century (most notably in [[Siege of Thessalonica (617)|617]] and [[Siege of Thessalonica (676\u2013678)|676\u2013678]]); however, they failed to capture the city. Byzantine brothers [[Saint Cyril and Saint Methodius]] were born in Thessaloniki and it was [[List of Byzantine Emperors|Byzantine Emperor]] [[Michael III]] who encouraged them to visit the northern regions as missionaries where they adopted the South Slavonic speech as the basis for the [[Old Church Slavonic language]]. In the 9th century, the Byzantines decided to move the market for Bulgarian goods from Constantinople to Thessaloniki. [[Tsar Simeon I]] of Bulgaria subsequently invaded Thrace, defeated a Byzantine army and forced the empire to move the market back to Constantinople. In 904, [[Saracens]], led by [[Leo of Tripoli]], managed to [[Sack of Thessalonica (904)|seize the city]] and after a ten-day depredation, left after having freed 4,000 Muslim prisoners while capturing 60 ships,<ref>Faith and sword: a short history of Christian-Muslim conflict By Alan G. Jamieson, pg.32</ref> and gaining a large loot and 22,000 slaves, mostly young people.<ref>cf. the account of [[John Kaminiates]]</ref>\n\nFollowing these events, the city recovered and the gradual restoration of Byzantine power during the 10th, 11th, and 12th centuries brought peace to the area. As the population of the city expanded, according to [[Benjamin of Tudela]], a Jewish community of some 500-strong was also established in the 12th century. During that time the city came to host the fair of [[Saint Demetrius]] every October, which was held just outside the [[Defensive wall|city walls]] and lasted six days.\n\nThe economic expansion of the city continued throughout the 12th century as the rule of the [[Komnenoi]] emperors expanded Byzantine control into [[Serbia]] and [[Hungary]], to the north. The city is known to have housed an imperial mint at this time. However, after the death of the emperor [[Manuel I Komnenos]] in 1180, the fortunes of the Byzantine Empire began to decline and in 1185, [[Normans|Norman]] rulers of [[Kingdom of Sicily|Sicily]], under the leadership of Count Baldwin and Riccardo d'Acerra, [[Sack of Thessalonica (1185)|attacked and occupied]] the city, resulting in considerable destruction. Nonetheless, their rule lasted less than a year and they were defeated by the Byzantine army in two battles months later, forcing them to evacuate the city.\n\n[[File:Fessaloniki.png|thumb|110px|left|Coat of arms of the [[Kingdom of Thessalonica]] (1204\u20131224).]]\n\nThessaloniki passed out of Byzantine hands in 1204, when [[Constantinople]] was captured by the [[Fourth Crusade]]. Thessaloniki and its surrounding territory \u2014 the [[Kingdom of Thessalonica]] \u2014 became the largest fief of the [[Latin Empire]], covering most of north and central Greece. The city was given by emperor [[Baldwin I of Constantinople|Baldwin]] I to his rival [[Boniface of Montferrat]], but was seized back once more in 1224 by [[Theodore Komnenos Doukas]], the Greek ruler of [[Despotate of Epirus|Epirus]], who established the [[Empire of Thessalonica]]. After the [[Battle of Klokotnitsa]] in 1230, Tsar [[Ivan Asen II of Bulgaria]] made the rulers of Thessaloniki his [[vassals]]. The city became subordinated to the [[Empire of Nicaea]] in 1242, when its ruler, [[John Komnenos Doukas]], lost his imperial title, and was fully annexed in 1246.\n\nAt this time, despite intermittent invasion, Thessaloniki sustained a large population and flourishing commerce, resulting in intellectual and artistic endeavour that can be traced in the numerous churches and frescoes of the era and by the evidence of its scholars teaching there, such as [[Thomas Magististos]], [[Demetrios Triklinios]], [[Nikephoros Choumnos]], [[Constantine Armenopoulos]], and [[Neilos Kabasilas]]. Examples of [[Byzantine art]] survive in the city, particularly the mosaics in some of its historic churches, including in the church of [[Hagia Sophia (Thessaloniki)|Hagia Sophia]] and the church of Saint George.\n\nIn the 14th century, however, the city faced upheaval in the form of the [[Zealots of Thessalonica|Zealot]] [[social movement]] (1342\u20131349), springing from a [[Hesychasm controversy|religious conflict]] between bishop [[Gregory Palamas]], who supported conservative principles, and the monk [[Barlaam of Calabria|Barlaam]]. Quickly, it turned into a political anti-aristocratic movement during the [[Byzantine civil war of 1341\u201347]], leading to the Zealots ruling the city from 1342 until 1349.\n\n==Ottoman era==\n{{further|Ottoman Greece|Greek War of Independence}}\n[[File:The oldest photograph of Thessaloniki.jpg|thumb|260px|The oldest photograph of Thessaloniki, 1863]]\n\nThe [[Byzantine Empire]], unable to hold the city against the [[Ottoman Empire]]'s advance, handed it over in 1423 to the [[Republic of Venice]]. Venice [[Siege of Thessalonica (1422\u20131430)|held the city]] until it was captured after a three-day-long siege by the [[Ottoman Dynasty|Ottoman Sultan]] [[Murad II]], on 29 March 1430. The Ottomans had previously captured Thessaloniki in 1387, but lost it in the aftermath of their defeat in the [[Battle of Ankara]] against [[Tamerlane]] in 1402, when the weakened Ottomans were forced to hand back a number of territories to the Byzantines.\nDuring the Ottoman period, the city's Muslim and Jewish population grew. By 1478, Thessaloniki had a population of 4,320 Muslims between 6,094 Greek Orthodox inhabitants. By c. 1500, the numbers of Muslims grew to 8,575 Muslims, with Greeks numbering at 7,986, making them a minority. Around the same time, Jews began arriving from Spain, fleeing persecution. In c. 1500, there were only 3,770 Jews, but by 1519, 15,715 Jews came to form 54% of the city's population. The invitation of the [[Sephardic Jew|Sephardic Jew's]] expelled from Spain by [[Catholic Monarchs|Ferdinand and Isabella]], was an Ottoman demographic strategy aiming to prevent the Greek population from dominating the city, as it had in previous years.<ref name=\"Cambridge\">The New Cambridge Medieval History p.779 - Rosamond McKitterick, Christopher Allmand</ref> Sephardic Jews, Muslims and Greek Orthodox remained the principal groups in the city for the next 400 years.<ref name=\"Cambridge\"/>\nThe city came to become the largest Jewish city in the world and remained as such for at least 200 years, often called \"Mother of Israel\". Of its 130,000 inhabitants at the start of the 20th century, around 60,000 were Sephardic Jews.<ref>[[Mark Mazower]], ''Salonica, City of Ghosts: Christians, Muslims and Jews, 1430-1950'', London: HarperCollins, 2004. {{ISBN|0-00-712023-0}}</ref> Some [[Romaniotes|Romaniote]] Jews were also present.<ref>for a review of recent work on the Jewish community of Thessaloniki, see Andrew Apostolou, \"Mother of Israel, Orphan of History: Writing on Jewish Salonika\", ''Israel Affairs'' '''13''':1:193-204 {{doi|10.1080/13537120601063499}}</ref>\nThessalon\u00edki, called ''Sel\u00e2nik'' in Turkish, became one of the most important cities in the Empire, viable as the foremost trade and commercial center in the Balkans. The railway reached the city in 1888 and new modern port facilities were built in 1896\u20131904. The founder of modern [[Turkey]], [[Mustafa Kemal Atat\u00fcrk]], was born there in 1881, and the [[Young Turk]] movement was headquartered in the city in the early 20th century.\n\n[[File:20121020 exterior of Yeni Mosque Thessaloniki Greece.jpg|thumb|180px|View of the [[New Mosque (Thessaloniki)|Yeni (New) Mosque]], built during the late Ottoman period.]]\n\nSel\u00e2nik was a [[sanjak]] center ([[Sanjak of Selanik]]) in the [[Rumeli Eyalet]] from 1393 to 1402 and again from 1430 to 1826, when it became center of a separate province, the [[Selanik Eyalet]]. From 1867 it was transformed into the [[Selanik Vilayet]], which included the sanjaks of Sel\u00e2nik (Thessaloniki), [[Drama]], and [[Serres, Greece|Serres]] (Siroz or Serez).\n\nArchitectural remains from the Ottoman period can be found mainly in the city's ''Ano Poli'' (Upper Town) district, in which traditional wooden houses and fountains survive the city's great fire in the following years. In the city center, a number of the stone mosques survived, notably the [[Hamza Bey Mosque]] on Egnatia (under restoration), the [[Aladja Imaret Mosque]] on Kassandrou Street, the [[Bezesten]] (covered market) on Venizelou Street, and [[Yahudi Hamam]] on Frangon Street. Most of the more than 40 [[minaret]]s were demolished after 1912, or collapsed due to the [[Great Thessaloniki Fire of 1917]]; the only surviving one is at the [[Arch and Tomb of Galerius|Rotonda]] (Arch and Tomb of Galerius). There are also a few remaining Ottoman [[Turkish bath|hammam]]s (bathhouses), particularly the [[Bey Hamam]] on Egnatia Avenue.\n\nAfter the outbreak of the [[Greek War of Independence]], a revolt took place also in Macedonia, under the leadership of [[Emmanouel Pappas]], which finally established in [[Chalkidiki]] peninsula. In May 1821 the governor of Thessaloniki Yusuf Bey (son of Ismail Bey)  ordered to kill any Greeks found in the streets. The Mulla of Thessalonica, Hayr\u0131\u00fclah, gives the following description of Yusuf's retaliations: ''\"Every day and every night you hear nothing in the streets of Thessaloniki but shouting and moaning. It seems that Yusuf Bey, the Yeniceri Agasi, the Suba\u015f\u0131, the hocas and the ulemas have all gone raving mad\"''. It would take until the end of the 19th century for the Greek community to recover.\n\nFrom 1870, driven by economic growth, the city's population exploded by 70%, reaching 135,000 in 1917. During the 19th century, Thessalon\u00edki became one of the cultural and political centres of the [[Bulgarians|Bulgarian]] revival movement in Macedonia. According to Bulgarian ethnographer [[Vasil Kanchov]] around the beginning of the 20th century there were approximately 10,000 [[Macedonians (Bulgarians)|Bulgarians]], forming a substantial minority in the city.<ref>{{cite book |author=\u0412\u0430\u0441\u0438\u043b \u041a\u044a\u043d\u0447\u043e\u0432 |title=\"\u0418\u0437\u0431\u0440\u0430\u043d\u0438 \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0438\u0437\u0432\u0435\u0434\u0435\u043d\u0438\u044f\", \u0422\u043e\u043c II, \"\u041c\u0430\u043a\u0435\u0434\u043e\u043d\u0438\u044f. \u0415\u0442\u043d\u043e\u0433\u0440\u0430\u0444\u0438\u044f \u0438 \u0441\u0442\u0430\u0442\u0438\u0441\u0442\u0438\u043a\u0430\" |url=http://www.promacedonia.org/vk/vk_2_01.htm |publisher=\u0418\u0437\u0434\u0430\u0442\u0435\u043b\u0441\u0442\u0432\u043e \"\u041d\u0430\u0443\u043a\u0430 \u0438 \u0438\u0437\u043a\u0443\u0441\u0442\u0432\u043e\" |location=\u0421\u043e\u0444\u0438\u044f |year=1970 |page=440 |language=Bulgarian}}</ref> In 1880 a [[Bulgarian Men's High School of Thessaloniki|Bulgarian Men's High School]] was founded, followed later by other educational institutions of the [[Bulgarian Exarchate]].

In 1903 a group of Bulgarian leftists and anarchists, tied to IMRO, organized series of [[Thessaloniki bombings of 1903]].

The next day, a Bulgarian division arrived, and Bulgarian troops were allowed to enter the city in limited numbers. Although officially governed by the Greeks, the final fate of the city hung in the balance. The Austrian government proposed to make Salonika into a neutral, internationalized city similar to what [[Danzig]] was to later become; it would have had a territory of 400\u2013460&nbsp;km\u00b2 and a population of 260,000.

After the Greek and Serbian victory in the [[Second Balkan War]], which broke out among the former allies over the final territorial dispositions,<ref>''Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica'', 12th edition, 1922, vol. 30, p. 376</ref> the city's status was finally settled by the [[Treaty of Bucharest (1913)|Treaty of Bucharest]] on August 10, 1913, sealing the city as an integral part of Greece. In 1915, during [[World War I]], a large [[Allies of World War I|Allied]] [[Expeditionary warfare|expeditionary force]] landed at Thessaloniki to use the city as the base for a massive offensive against pro-German Bulgaria. This precipitated the political conflict between the pro-Allied Prime Minister, [[Eleftherios Venizelos]] and the pro-neutral [[List of Kings of Greece|King]] [[Constantine I of Greece|Constantine]]. In 1916, pro-[[Venizelism|Venizelist]] army officers, with the support of the Allies, launched an uprising, which resulted in the establishment of a pro-Allied [[Provisional government|temporary government]] (the \"[[Provisional Government of National Defence]]\"), headed by Venizelos, that controlled northern Greece and the Aegean, against the official government of the King in Athens. Ever since, Thessaloniki has been dubbed as ''symprot\u00e9vousa'' (\"co-capital\").\n\nOn {{OldStyleDate|18 August|1917|5 August}}, the city faced one of it most destructive events, where most of the city was destroyed by [[Great Thessaloniki Fire of 1917|a single fire]] accidentally sparked by French soldiers in encampments in the city. The fire left some 72,000 homeless, many of them Jewish, of a population of approximately 271,157 at the time. Venizelos forbade the reconstruction of the town center until a full modern city plan was prepared. This was accomplished a few years later by French architect and [[archeologist]] [[Ernest Hebrard]]. The Hebrard plan, although never fully completed, swept away the oriental features of Thessalon\u00edki and transformed it into the modern European metropolis that it is today. One effect of the great fire, came to be dubbed the [[Great Thessaloniki Fire of 1917]], was that nearly half of the city's Jewish homes and livelihoods were destroyed, leading to massive Jewish emigration. Many went to [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]], others to [[Paris]], while others found their way to the United States (among them some ancestors of the actress [[Lea Michele]]). Their populations, however, were quickly replaced by considerable numbers of Greek refugees from [[Anatolia|Asia Minor]] as a result of the [[population exchange between Greece and Turkey]], following the defeat of the Greek forces in Anatolia during the [[Greco-Turkish War (1919-1922)|Greco-Turkish War]]. With the arrival of these new refugees, the city expanded enormously and haphazardly.

The city suffered considerable damage from Allied bombing and almost all of its entire [[History of the Jews of Thessaloniki|Jewish population]] that remained following the 1917 fire, was exterminated by the Nazis. Barely a thousand Jews survived. Thessaloniki was rebuilt and recovered fairly quickly after the war, with this resurgence taking in both a rapid growth in its population and a large-scale development of new infrastructure and industry throughout the 1950s, 1960s and 1970s. Most of the [[Urban planning|urban development]] of that period was however without an all-embracing plan, contributing to the traffic and zoning problems remaining to this day.\n\n==Modern era==\n[[File:20160516 016 thessaloniki.jpg|thumb|View from the [[Walls of Thessaloniki|city's walls]]]]\n[[File:Salonica-view-aerial.jpg|thumb|200px|City's centre with the port]]\n\nOn 20 June 1978, the city was hit by a powerful [[earthquake]], registering a [[Moment magnitude scale|moment magnitude]] of 6.5. The tremor caused considerable damage to several buildings and even to some of the city's Byzantine monuments; forty people were crushed to death when an entire apartment block collapsed in the central Hippodromio district. Nonetheless, the large city recovered with considerable speed from the effects of the disaster. Early Christian and Byzantine monuments of Thessaloniki were inscribed on the [[UNESCO]] [[World Heritage Site|World Heritage list]] in 1988 and Thessaloniki later became [[European Capital of Culture|European City of Culture]] in 1997.\n\n[[File:Seafront.jpg|thumb|200px|[[Nikis Avenue]] on the seafront.]]\n\nThessaloniki today has become one of the most important trade and business hubs in the [[Balkans]] with its port, the [[Port of Thessaloniki]] being one of the largest in the Aegean, and facilitating trade throughout the Balkan hinterland. The city also forms one of the largest student centres in [[Southeastern Europe]] and is host to the largest student population in [[Greece]].<!---got numbers? Forget \"large!\"--> The city sustains two state universities \u2014 the [[Aristotle University of Thessaloniki]], the largest university in [[Greece]] (founded in 1926), and the [[University of Macedonia]], alongside the Technological Education Institute of Thessaloniki. It also sponsors a range of private international institutions, either affiliated with universities in other nations, or accredited abroad.\n\nIn June 2003, the city was host to the Summit meeting of European leaders, at the end of the Greek Presidency of the [[European Union|EU]], with the summit taking place at the [[Porto Carras]] resort in [[Chalkidiki]], to aid security precautions. In 2004 the city hosted a number of the [[football (soccer)|football]] events forming part of the [[2004 Summer Olympics|2004 Summer Olympic Games]] and experienced a massive modernisation program. Thessaloniki unsuccessfully bid for the 2008 World EXPO, this time won by [[Zaragoza]] in [[Spain]], but another planned bid for 2017 was announced in September 2006 and is now in full development.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* Miller, William. \"Salonika,\" ''English Historical Review'' (1917) 32#126 pp.&nbsp;161\u2013174 [https://www.jstor.org/stable/551652 in JSTOR]\n* Molho, Anthony. \"The Jewish Community of Salonika: The End of a Long History.\" ''Diaspora: A Journal of Transnational Studies'' 1.1 (1991): 100\u2013122.

Today with the opening of borders in Southeastern Europe it is currently experiencing a strong revival, serving as the prime port for the northern Greek regions of [[Macedonia (Greece)|Macedonia]] and [[Thrace]], as well as for the whole of [[Southeastern Europe]].\n\n==Hellenistic era==\n{{further|Ancient Greece|Hellenistic Greece}}\n[[File:Coin of Cassander.jpg|thumb|180px|Coin depicting [[Cassander]], founder of Thessalonica]]\n[[File:The Derveni krater, late 4th century B.C., side A, Dionysus and Ariadne, Archaeological Museum, Thessaloniki, Greece (7457851940).jpg|thumb|180px|left|Macedonian-era crater at the [[Archaeological Museum of Thessaloniki]].]]\n\nThe town was founded around 315 BC by [[Cassander|King Cassander of Macedon]], on or near the site of the ancient town of [[Therma]] and twenty-six other local villages. [[Cassander|King Cassander of Macedon]] named the new city after his wife [[Thessalonice of Macedon|Thessalonike]], a half-sister of [[Alexander the Great]]. She gained her name (\"victory of Thessalians\", from [[Greek Language|Greek]]: ''[[Nike (mythology)|nik\u0113]]'' \"victory\") from her father, [[Philip II of Macedon|Philip II]], to commemorate her birth on the day of his gaining a victory over the [[Phocians]], who were defeated with the help of [[Thessalian]] horsemen, the best in Greece at that time. Thessaloniki developed rapidly and as early as the 2nd century BC, it had its first walls built, which enclosed and protected the city. The city also came to be an autonomous part of the Kingdom of [[Macedon]], with its own parliament where a King was represented that could interfere in the city's domestic affairs.\n\n==Roman era==\n{{further|Roman Greece}}\n[[File:Thessaloniki-Arch of Galerius (eastern face).jpg|thumb|The [[Arch of Galerius and Rotunda|Arch of Galerius]] on [[Egnatia Street, Thessaloniki|Egnatia Street]]]]\n\nAfter the fall of the Kingdom of [[Macedon]] in 168 BC, Thessalonica as it came to be called in Latin, became a city of the [[Roman Republic]]. It grew to be an important trade-hub located on the [[Via Egnatia]], the [[Roman road]] connecting [[Byzantium]] (later [[Constantinople]]) with [[Epidamnos|Dyrrhachium]] (now [[Durr\u00ebs]] in [[Albania]]), which facilitated trade between Europe and Asia. The city became the capital of one of the four Roman districts of Macedonia while it kept its privileges but was ruled by a [[praetor]] and had a Roman garrison. Also for a short time in the 1st century BC, Thessalonica even became capital for all the Greek provinces. Due to the city's key commercial importance, a spacious harbour was built by the Romans, the famous ''Burrowed Harbour'' (\u03a3\u03ba\u03b1\u03c0\u03c4\u03cc\u03c2 \u039b\u03b9\u03bc\u03ae\u03bd) that accommodated the city's trade, up to the 18th century. Later, with the help of silt deposits from the [[Vardar|Axios]] river, land was reclaimed and the port was expanded. Remnants of the old harbour's docks can be found in present-day under Frangon Street, near the city's Catholic Church.\n\nThessaloniki's [[acropolis]], located in the northern hills, was built in 55 BC for security reasons, following [[Thracian]] raids in the city's outskirts at the time.\n \nAbout 50 AD, while on his second missionary journey, [[Paul the Apostle]] reasoned with the Jews from the [[Masoretic text|Scripture]]s in this city's chief synagogue on three Sabbaths and sowed the seeds for Thessaloniki's first Christian church. During Paul's time in the city, both Jews and Greeks came to believe the [[Gospel]], as well as some of the city's leading women. However, because the remaining Jews at the synagogue were furious with Paul for what he'd done in their community and were also furious with those who had come to believe Paul's message, the Apostle and his traveling companions, [[Silas]] and [[Saint Timothy|Timothy]], were eventually sent out of Thessaloniki during the night by the new Christian converts. From there the [[church planter]]s went to [[Veroia]], aka [[Berea (Bible)|Berea]], where the people in that city also heard and believed the Gospel. This so enraged the Thessalonian Jews when they found out what Paul and his companions had done, the Jews went to Berea and persecuted the evangelists in that city also. The three men eventually continued their travels and ministry; and, Paul wrote two [[Pauline epistles|letters]] to the new church at Thessaloniki, probably between 51 and 53, the [[First Epistle to the Thessalonians]] and the [[Second Epistle to the Thessalonians]]. These letters were to encourage the new believers to persist in the faith in the face of strong opposition, to encourage personal sanctification, to encourage them about those who had \"fallen asleep,\" yet to warn about the Lord returning as a \"thief in the night\" and to correct incorrect thinking about the coming [[Antichrist]], among writing about other important matters.<ref>\"The International Inductive Study Bible,\" NASV, Harvest House Publishers, Eugene, OR, 1993 Precept Ministries, pp.1933,1936-1938,1942,1944</ref>\n\nIn 306, Thessalon\u00edki acquired a patron saint, [[St. Demetrius]]. He is credited with a number of miracles that saved the city and was the Roman [[Proconsul]] of Greece, under the anti-Christian emperor [[Maximian]]. St. Demetrius was martyred at a Roman prison, where the [[Aghios Demetrios|Church of St. Demetrius]] lies today. The church was first built by the Roman [[Sub-prefecture|sub-prefect]] of [[Illyricum (Roman province)|Illyricum]], [[Leontios]], in 463. Other important remains from this period include the [[Arch and Tomb of Galerius]], located in the city centre of the modern [[Thessaloniki]].\n\nIn 390 Gothic troops under the commands of the Roman Emperor [[Theodosius I]], led a [[Massacre of Thessalonica|massacre]] against the inhabitants of Thessalonica, who had risen in revolt against the [[Germanic peoples|Germanic]] soldiers.\n\n==Byzantine era==\n{{further|Byzantine Greece|Medieval Thessalonica|Zealots of Thessalonica|Kingdom of Thessalonica|Empire of Thessalonica}}\n[[File:Saints Cyril and Methodius.jpg|thumb|left|180px|[[Saints Cyril and Methodius]].]]\n[[File:Agios Dimitrios1.jpg|thumb|The basilica of [[Hagios Demetrios]], patron saint of the city.]]\n[[Image:Agia Sofia front July 2006.jpg|thumb|The [[Hagia Sophia (Thessaloniki)|Church of Holy Wisdom]] (Hagia Sophia) in central Thessaloniki.]]\n[[File:Cristofano dell'altissimo, teodoro gaza, 1556 crop.JPG|thumb|180px|[[Theodorus Gaza]], also called by the epithet ''Thessalonicensis'' (Latin) and ''Thessalonikeus'' (Greek), was a humanist and translator of Aristotle.]]\n\nWhen the Roman [[Praetorian prefecture of Illyricum|Prefecture of Illyricum]] was divided between the East and West Roman Empires in 379, Thessaloniki became the capital of the new Prefecture of Illyricum (reduced in size). Its importance was second only to [[Constantinople]] itself, while in 390 it was the location of a revolt against the emperor [[Theodosius I]] and his Gothic mercenaries. [[Butheric]], their general, together with several of his high officials, were killed in an uprising triggered by the imprisoning of a favorite local charioteer for [[pederasty]] with one of Butheric's slave boys.<ref>Gibbon, ''The Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire,'' ch.27 2:56</ref> 7,000 - 15,000 of the citizens were [[Massacre of Thessaloniki|massacred]] in the city's hippodrome in revenge \u2013 an act which earned Theodosius a temporary excommunication.\n\nA quiet interlude followed until repeated barbarian invasions after the [[fall of the Roman Empire]], while a catastrophic earthquake severely damaged the city in 620, resulting in the destruction of the Roman Forum and several other public buildings. Thessaloniki itself came under attack from [[Slavs]] in the 7th century (most notably in [[Siege of Thessalonica (617)|617]] and [[Siege of Thessalonica (676\u2013678)|676\u2013678]]); however, they failed to capture the city. Byzantine brothers [[Saint Cyril and Saint Methodius]] were born in Thessaloniki and it was [[List of Byzantine Emperors|Byzantine Emperor]] [[Michael III]] who encouraged them to visit the northern regions as missionaries where they adopted the South Slavonic speech as the basis for the [[Old Church Slavonic language]]. In the 9th century, the Byzantines decided to move the market for Bulgarian goods from Constantinople to Thessaloniki. [[Tsar Simeon I]] of Bulgaria subsequently invaded Thrace, defeated a Byzantine army and forced the empire to move the market back to Constantinople. In 904, [[Saracens]], led by [[Leo of Tripoli]], managed to [[Sack of Thessalonica (904)|seize the city]] and after a ten-day depredation, left after having freed 4,000 Muslim prisoners while capturing 60 ships,<ref>Faith and sword: a short history of Christian-Muslim conflict By Alan G. Jamieson, pg.32</ref> and gaining a large loot and 22,000 slaves, mostly young people.<ref>cf. the account of [[John Kaminiates]]</ref>\n\nFollowing these events, the city recovered and the gradual restoration of Byzantine power during the 10th, 11th, and 12th centuries brought peace to the area. As the population of the city expanded, according to [[Benjamin of Tudela]], a Jewish community of some 500-strong was also established in the 12th century. During that time the city came to host the fair of [[Saint Demetrius]] every October, which was held just outside the [[Defensive wall|city walls]] and lasted six days.\n\nThe economic expansion of the city continued throughout the 12th century as the rule of the [[Komnenoi]] emperors expanded Byzantine control into [[Serbia]] and [[Hungary]], to the north. The city is known to have housed an imperial mint at this time. However, after the death of the emperor [[Manuel I Komnenos]] in 1180, the fortunes of the Byzantine Empire began to decline and in 1185, [[Normans|Norman]] rulers of [[Kingdom of Sicily|Sicily]], under the leadership of Count Baldwin and Riccardo d'Acerra, [[Sack of Thessalonica (1185)|attacked and occupied]] the city, resulting in considerable destruction. Nonetheless, their rule lasted less than a year and they were defeated by the Byzantine army in two battles months later, forcing them to evacuate the city.\n\n[[File:Fessaloniki.png|thumb|110px|left|Coat of arms of the [[Kingdom of Thessalonica]] (1204\u20131224).]]\n\nThessaloniki passed out of Byzantine hands in 1204, when [[Constantinople]] was captured by the [[Fourth Crusade]]. Thessaloniki and its surrounding territory \u2014 the [[Kingdom of Thessalonica]] \u2014 became the largest fief of the [[Latin Empire]], covering most of north and central Greece. The city was given by emperor [[Baldwin I of Constantinople|Baldwin]] I to his rival [[Boniface of Montferrat]], but was seized back once more in 1224 by [[Theodore Komnenos Doukas]], the Greek ruler of [[Despotate of Epirus|Epirus]], who established the [[Empire of Thessalonica]]. After the [[Battle of Klokotnitsa]] in 1230, Tsar [[Ivan Asen II of Bulgaria]] made the rulers of Thessaloniki his [[vassals]]. The city became subordinated to the [[Empire of Nicaea]] in 1242, when its ruler, [[John Komnenos Doukas]], lost his imperial title, and was fully annexed in 1246.\n\nAt this time, despite intermittent invasion, Thessaloniki sustained a large population and flourishing commerce, resulting in intellectual and artistic endeavour that can be traced in the numerous churches and frescoes of the era and by the evidence of its scholars teaching there, such as [[Thomas Magististos]], [[Demetrios Triklinios]], [[Nikephoros Choumnos]], [[Constantine Armenopoulos]], and [[Neilos Kabasilas]]. Examples of [[Byzantine art]] survive in the city, particularly the mosaics in some of its historic churches, including in the church of [[Hagia Sophia (Thessaloniki)|Hagia Sophia]] and the church of Saint George.\n\nIn the 14th century, however, the city faced upheaval in the form of the [[Zealots of Thessalonica|Zealot]] [[social movement]] (1342\u20131349), springing from a [[Hesychasm controversy|religious conflict]] between bishop [[Gregory Palamas]], who supported conservative principles, and the monk [[Barlaam of Calabria|Barlaam]]. Quickly, it turned into a political anti-aristocratic movement during the [[Byzantine civil war of 1341\u201347]], leading to the Zealots ruling the city from 1342 until 1349.\n\n==Ottoman era==\n{{further|Ottoman Greece|Greek War of Independence}}\n[[File:The oldest photograph of Thessaloniki.jpg|thumb|260px|The oldest photograph of Thessaloniki, 1863]]\n\nThe [[Byzantine Empire]], unable to hold the city against the [[Ottoman Empire]]'s advance, handed it over in 1423 to the [[Republic of Venice]]. Venice [[Siege of Thessalonica (1422\u20131430)|held the city]] until it was captured after a three-day-long siege by the [[Ottoman Dynasty|Ottoman Sultan]] [[Murad II]], on 29 March 1430. The Ottomans had previously captured Thessaloniki in 1387, but lost it in the aftermath of their defeat in the [[Battle of Ankara]] against [[Tamerlane]] in 1402, when the weakened Ottomans were forced to hand back a number of territories to the Byzantines.\nDuring the Ottoman period, the city's Muslim and Jewish population grew. By 1478, Thessaloniki had a population of 4,320 Muslims between 6,094 Greek Orthodox inhabitants. By c. 1500, the numbers of Muslims grew to 8,575 Muslims, with Greeks numbering at 7,986, making them a minority. Around the same time, Jews began arriving from Spain, fleeing persecution. In c. 1500, there were only 3,770 Jews, but by 1519, 15,715 Jews came to form 54% of the city's population. The invitation of the [[Sephardic Jew|Sephardic Jew's]] expelled from Spain by [[Catholic Monarchs|Ferdinand and Isabella]], was an Ottoman demographic strategy aiming to prevent the Greek population from dominating the city, as it had in previous years.<ref name=\"Cambridge\">The New Cambridge Medieval History p.779 - Rosamond McKitterick, Christopher Allmand</ref> Sephardic Jews, Muslims and Greek Orthodox remained the principal groups in the city for the next 400 years.<ref name=\"Cambridge\"/>\nThe city came to become the largest Jewish city in the world and remained as such for at least 200 years, often called \"Mother of Israel\". Of its 130,000 inhabitants at the start of the 20th century, around 60,000 were Sephardic Jews.<ref>[[Mark Mazower]], ''Salonica, City of Ghosts: Christians, Muslims and Jews, 1430-1950'', London: HarperCollins, 2004. {{ISBN|0-00-712023-0}}</ref> Some [[Romaniotes|Romaniote]] Jews were also present.<ref>for a review of recent work on the Jewish community of Thessaloniki, see Andrew Apostolou, \"Mother of Israel, Orphan of History: Writing on Jewish Salonika\", ''Israel Affairs'' '''13''':1:193-204 {{doi|10.1080/13537120601063499}}</ref>\nThessalon\u00edki, called ''Sel\u00e2nik'' in Turkish, became one of the most important cities in the Empire, viable as the foremost trade and commercial center in the Balkans. The railway reached the city in 1888 and new modern port facilities were built in 1896\u20131904. The founder of modern [[Turkey]], [[Mustafa Kemal Atat\u00fcrk]], was born there in 1881, and the [[Young Turk]] movement was headquartered in the city in the early 20th century.\n\n[[File:20121020 exterior of Yeni Mosque Thessaloniki Greece.jpg|thumb|180px|View of the [[New Mosque (Thessaloniki)|Yeni (New) Mosque]], built during the late Ottoman period.]]\n\nSel\u00e2nik was a [[sanjak]] center ([[Sanjak of Selanik]]) in the [[Rumeli Eyalet]] from 1393 to 1402 and again from 1430 to 1826, when it became center of a separate province, the [[Selanik Eyalet]]. From 1867 it was transformed into the [[Selanik Vilayet]], which included the sanjaks of Sel\u00e2nik (Thessaloniki), [[Drama]], and [[Serres, Greece|Serres]] (Siroz or Serez).\n\nArchitectural remains from the Ottoman period can be found mainly in the city's ''Ano Poli'' (Upper Town) district, in which traditional wooden houses and fountains survive the city's great fire in the following years. In the city center, a number of the stone mosques survived, notably the [[Hamza Bey Mosque]] on Egnatia (under restoration), the [[Aladja Imaret Mosque]] on Kassandrou Street, the [[Bezesten]] (covered market) on Venizelou Street, and [[Yahudi Hamam]] on Frangon Street. Most of the more than 40 [[minaret]]s were demolished after 1912, or collapsed due to the [[Great Thessaloniki Fire of 1917]]; the only surviving one is at the [[Arch and Tomb of Galerius|Rotonda]] (Arch and Tomb of Galerius). There are also a few remaining Ottoman [[Turkish bath|hammam]]s (bathhouses), particularly the [[Bey Hamam]] on Egnatia Avenue.\n\nAfter the outbreak of the [[Greek War of Independence]], a revolt took place also in Macedonia, under the leadership of [[Emmanouel Pappas]], which finally established in [[Chalkidiki]] peninsula. In May 1821 the governor of Thessaloniki Yusuf Bey (son of Ismail Bey)  ordered to kill any Greeks found in the streets. The Mulla of Thessalonica, Hayr\u0131\u00fclah, gives the following description of Yusuf's retaliations: ''\"Every day and every night you hear nothing in the streets of Thessaloniki but shouting and moaning. It seems that Yusuf Bey, the Yeniceri Agasi, the Suba\u015f\u0131, the hocas and the ulemas have all gone raving mad\"''. It would take until the end of the 19th century for the Greek community to recover.\n\nFrom 1870, driven by economic growth, the city's population exploded by 70%, reaching 135,000 in 1917. During the 19th century, Thessalon\u00edki became one of the cultural and political centres of the [[Bulgarians|Bulgarian]] revival movement in Macedonia. According to Bulgarian ethnographer [[Vasil Kanchov]] around the beginning of the 20th century there were approximately 10,000 [[Macedonians (Bulgarians)|Bulgarians]], forming a substantial minority in the city.<ref>{{cite book |author=\u0412\u0430\u0441\u0438\u043b \u041a\u044a\u043d\u0447\u043e\u0432 |title=\"\u0418\u0437\u0431\u0440\u0430\u043d\u0438 \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0438\u0437\u0432\u0435\u0434\u0435\u043d\u0438\u044f\", \u0422\u043e\u043c II, \"\u041c\u0430\u043a\u0435\u0434\u043e\u043d\u0438\u044f. \u0415\u0442\u043d\u043e\u0433\u0440\u0430\u0444\u0438\u044f \u0438 \u0441\u0442\u0430\u0442\u0438\u0441\u0442\u0438\u043a\u0430\" |url=http://www.promacedonia.org/vk/vk_2_01.htm |publisher=\u0418\u0437\u0434\u0430\u0442\u0435\u043b\u0441\u0442\u0432\u043e \"\u041d\u0430\u0443\u043a\u0430 \u0438 \u0438\u0437\u043a\u0443\u0441\u0442\u0432\u043e\" |location=\u0421\u043e\u0444\u0438\u044f |year=1970 |page=440 |language=Bulgarian}}</ref> In 1880 a [[Bulgarian Men's High School of Thessaloniki|Bulgarian Men's High School]] was founded, followed later by other educational institutions of the [[Bulgarian Exarchate]].

This was a day after the feast of the city's patron saint, Saint Demetrios, which has become the date customarily celebrated as the anniversary of the city's liberation. The next day, a Bulgarian division arrived, and Bulgarian troops were allowed to enter the city in limited numbers. Although officially governed by the Greeks, the final fate of the city hung in the balance. The Austrian government proposed to make Salonika into a neutral, internationalized city similar to what [[Danzig]] was to later become; it would have had a territory of 400\u2013460&nbsp;km\u00b2 and a population of 260,000. It would be \"neither Greek, Bulgarian nor Turkish, but ''Jewish''\".<ref>[[Rena Molho]], \"The Jewish community of Salonika and its incorporation into the Greek state 1912-19\", ''Middle Eastern Studies'' '''24''':4:391-403 {{doi|10.1080/00263208808700753}}; see also N.

After the Greek and Serbian victory in the [[Second Balkan War]], which broke out among the former allies over the final territorial dispositions,<ref>''Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica'', 12th edition, 1922, vol. 30, p. 376</ref> the city's status was finally settled by the [[Treaty of Bucharest (1913)|Treaty of Bucharest]] on August 10, 1913, sealing the city as an integral part of Greece. In 1915, during [[World War I]], a large [[Allies of World War I|Allied]] [[Expeditionary warfare|expeditionary force]] landed at Thessaloniki to use the city as the base for a massive offensive against pro-German Bulgaria. This precipitated the political conflict between the pro-Allied Prime Minister, [[Eleftherios Venizelos]] and the pro-neutral [[List of Kings of Greece|King]] [[Constantine I of Greece|Constantine]]. In 1916, pro-[[Venizelism|Venizelist]] army officers, with the support of the Allies, launched an uprising, which resulted in the establishment of a pro-Allied [[Provisional government|temporary government]] (the \"[[Provisional Government of National Defence]]\"), headed by Venizelos, that controlled northern Greece and the Aegean, against the official government of the King in Athens. Ever since, Thessaloniki has been dubbed as ''symprot\u00e9vousa'' (\"co-capital\").\n\nOn {{OldStyleDate|18 August|1917|5 August}}, the city faced one of it most destructive events, where most of the city was destroyed by [[Great Thessaloniki Fire of 1917|a single fire]] accidentally sparked by French soldiers in encampments in the city. The fire left some 72,000 homeless, many of them Jewish, of a population of approximately 271,157 at the time. Venizelos forbade the reconstruction of the town center until a full modern city plan was prepared. This was accomplished a few years later by French architect and [[archeologist]] [[Ernest Hebrard]]. The Hebrard plan, although never fully completed, swept away the oriental features of Thessalon\u00edki and transformed it into the modern European metropolis that it is today. One effect of the great fire, came to be dubbed the [[Great Thessaloniki Fire of 1917]], was that nearly half of the city's Jewish homes and livelihoods were destroyed, leading to massive Jewish emigration. Many went to [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]], others to [[Paris]], while others found their way to the United States (among them some ancestors of the actress [[Lea Michele]]). Their populations, however, were quickly replaced by considerable numbers of Greek refugees from [[Anatolia|Asia Minor]] as a result of the [[population exchange between Greece and Turkey]], following the defeat of the Greek forces in Anatolia during the [[Greco-Turkish War (1919-1922)|Greco-Turkish War]]. With the arrival of these new refugees, the city expanded enormously and haphazardly. These events made the city to be nicknamed \"The Refugee Capital\" (''I Prot\u00e9vousa ton Prosf\u00fdgon'') and \"Mother of the Poor\" (''Ftokhom\u00e1na'').\n\n<gallery>\nFile:Kejot vo Solun.jpg|The promenade (1912-19)\nFile:Coloured photograph of Eleftherias Square, Thessaloniki, in 1914.png|[[Eleftherias Square]], 1914\nFile:Francuska vojksa vo Solun.jpg|French army in the city, 1915\nFile:Revolution Boulevard in Salonica Postcard.jpg|Boulevard \"de la Revolution\" during the National Defence movement\nFile:Incendie de Salonique en 1917 rue Egnatia.jpg|Photo of a street after the [[Great Thessaloniki Fire of 1917|fire of 1917]]\nFile:Thessaloniki late 1910.png|Eleftherias Square, late 1910s\nFile:Galerius Triumphbogen 1920 - 2.jpg|The arch of Galerius, 1920\n</gallery>\n\n==Metaxas regime and World War II==\n{{further|Axis occupation of Greece during World War II}}\n\n[[File:A mother who cries (Thessaloniki 1936).jpg|thumb|180px|Dead protester of 1st May 1936]]\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 101I-168-0894-22A, Griechenland, Saloniki, Erfassung von Juden.jpg|thumb|180px|Registration of the Jews of Thessaloniki by the Nazis, July 1942.]]\n\nOn May 1936, a massive strike by tobacco workers led to general anarchy in the city and [[Ioannis Metaxas]] (future dictator, then PM) ordered its repression. The events and the deaths of the protesters inspired [[Yiannis Ritsos]] to write the ''Epitafios''.\n\nThessaloniki fell to the forces of [[Nazi Germany]] on April 22, 1941 and remained under German occupation until 30 October 1944. The city suffered considerable damage from Allied bombing and almost all of its entire [[History of the Jews of Thessaloniki|Jewish population]] that remained following the 1917 fire, was exterminated by the Nazis. Barely a thousand Jews survived. Thessaloniki was rebuilt and recovered fairly quickly after the war, with this resurgence taking in both a rapid growth in its population and a large-scale development of new infrastructure and industry throughout the 1950s, 1960s and 1970s. Most of the [[Urban planning|urban development]] of that period was however without an all-embracing plan, contributing to the traffic and zoning problems remaining to this day.\n\n==Modern era==\n[[File:20160516 016 thessaloniki.jpg|thumb|View from the [[Walls of Thessaloniki|city's walls]]]]\n[[File:Salonica-view-aerial.jpg|thumb|200px|City's centre with the port]]\n\nOn 20 June 1978, the city was hit by a powerful [[earthquake]], registering a [[Moment magnitude scale|moment magnitude]] of 6.5. The tremor caused considerable damage to several buildings and even to some of the city's Byzantine monuments; forty people were crushed to death when an entire apartment block collapsed in the central Hippodromio district. Nonetheless, the large city recovered with considerable speed from the effects of the disaster. Early Christian and Byzantine monuments of Thessaloniki were inscribed on the [[UNESCO]] [[World Heritage Site|World Heritage list]] in 1988 and Thessaloniki later became [[European Capital of Culture|European City of Culture]] in 1997.\n\n[[File:Seafront.jpg|thumb|200px|[[Nikis Avenue]] on the seafront.]]\n\nThessaloniki today has become one of the most important trade and business hubs in the [[Balkans]] with its port, the [[Port of Thessaloniki]] being one of the largest in the Aegean, and facilitating trade throughout the Balkan hinterland. The city also forms one of the largest student centres in [[Southeastern Europe]] and is host to the largest student population in [[Greece]].<!---got numbers? Forget \"large!\"--> The city sustains two state universities \u2014 the [[Aristotle University of Thessaloniki]], the largest university in [[Greece]] (founded in 1926), and the [[University of Macedonia]], alongside the Technological Education Institute of Thessaloniki. It also sponsors a range of private international institutions, either affiliated with universities in other nations, or accredited abroad.\n\nIn June 2003, the city was host to the Summit meeting of European leaders, at the end of the Greek Presidency of the [[European Union|EU]], with the summit taking place at the [[Porto Carras]] resort in [[Chalkidiki]], to aid security precautions. In 2004 the city hosted a number of the [[football (soccer)|football]] events forming part of the [[2004 Summer Olympics|2004 Summer Olympic Games]] and experienced a massive modernisation program. Thessaloniki unsuccessfully bid for the 2008 World EXPO, this time won by [[Zaragoza]] in [[Spain]], but another planned bid for 2017 was announced in September 2006 and is now in full development.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* Miller, William. \"Salonika,\" ''English Historical Review'' (1917) 32#126 pp.&nbsp;161\u2013174 [https://www.jstor.org/stable/551652 in JSTOR]\n* Molho, Anthony. \"The Jewish Community of Salonika: The End of a Long History.\" ''Diaspora: A Journal of Transnational Studies'' 1.1 (1991): 100\u2013122.

The first reported spinosaurid from Asia, it is confidently known only from tooth [[Fossil|fossils]], the first of which were found in the [[Sao Khua Formation]], with more teeth later recovered from the younger [[Khok Kruat Formation]]. The [[type species]] '''''Siamosaurus suteethorni''''', whose name honours Thai [[palaeontologist]] [[Varavudh Suteethorn]], was formally described in [[1986 in paleontology|1986]]. One possible ''Siamosaurus'' tooth was discovered in the Japanese [[Sebayashi Formation]] in 1994, and a tooth similar to it was found at the same site in 2015. In 2009, four teeth from China's [[Xinlong Formation]] formerly thought to belong to a [[Pliosauroidea|pliosaur]] (under the species name '''\"''Sinopliosaurus''\" ''fusuiensis''''') were identified as those of a spinosaurid. \"''S''.\" ''fusuiensis'' may be the same animal as ''Siamosaurus''. Two partial spinosaurid skeletons have been found in Thailand, one in the Sao Khua and the other in the Khok Kruat Formation, but whether they belong to ''Siamosaurus'' or not is unclear.\n\nThe [[holotype]] tooth is {{Convert|62.5|mm|}} long and {{Convert|16.6 by 12.5|mm|}} wide at its base. Since it is a tooth [[taxon]], ''Siamosaurus''{{'}}s body size and weight are uncertain, though it has been estimated at between {{Convert|5.1 to 9.1|m||abbr=}} and weighing {{Convert|1|tonne|short ton}}. ''Siamosaurus''<nowiki/>'s teeth were straight, oval to circular in cross section, and lined with distinct lengthwise grooves. The tooth's [[Tooth enamel|enamel]] was wrinkled, similar to that of teeth from the related genus ''[[Baryonyx]]''. ''Siamosaurus''{{'}}s identity has been questioned by many palaeontologists, who argue that its teeth are too similar to those of contemporaneous aquatic reptiles for it to be confidently classed as a dinosaur. Other researchers, who agree that the teeth are spinosaur in origin, deem them too similar to those of other Early Cretaceous spinosaurs to  raise a new genus unequivocally. Based on characteristics of their teeth, ''Siamosaurus'' and \"''Sinopliosaurus''\" ''fusuiensis'' have been placed in the [[Spinosaurinae]] [[subfamily]].\n\nLike in all spinosaurids, ''Siamosaurus''{{'}}s teeth were conical, with reduced or absent [[Serration|serrations]]. This made them suitable for impaling rather than tearing flesh, a trait typically seen in largely [[piscivorous]] (fish-eating) animals. In addition, its relatives are known to have consumed [[Pterosaur|pterosaurs]] and small to medium-sized dinosaurs, and there is fossil evidence of ''Siamosaurus'' itself eating [[Sauropoda|sauropod]] dinosaurs, either via scavenging or active hunting. ''Siamosaurus'' lived in a [[Semi-arid climate|semi-arid]] habitat of [[Floodplain|floodplains]] and meandering rivers, where it coexisted with other theropod, sauropod, and (in at least the Khok Kruat Formation) [[Iguanodontia|iguanodontian]] dinosaurs. [[Isotope analysis]] of spinosaurid teeth indicates they may have had [[semiaquatic]] habits, and ''Siamosaurus''{{'}}s role as a largely piscivorous predator might have reduced the prominence of contemporaneous [[Crocodilia|crocodilians]] competing for the same food source.\n\n== History of discovery ==\n[[File:Cretaceous_strata_in_northeast_and_southeastern_Thailand.png|thumb|left|alt=Map of northeast and southeastern Thailand showing the distribution of Cretaceous geological strata | Geological map of the [[Khorat Plateau]] in northeast Thailand]]\n\nThe [[Sao Khua Formation]], where the first ''Siamosaurus'' [[Fossil|fossils]] were discovered, is part of the [[Khorat Group]].<ref name=\":0\">Buffetaut, E.; and Ingevat, R.

It is among the larger teeth discovered by Buffetaut and Ingavat, one much smaller specimen (DMR TF 2043b) measures {{Convert|24.3|mm||abbr=on}} in length. According to the authors, this dramatic size range suggests the teeth are from individuals of different ages. The holotype tooth is relatively straight, with only minor front to back curvature. It is oval in cross section while other specimens are nearly circular in this aspect. Unlike in most theropods, the [[Glossary of dinosaur anatomy#carinae|carinae]] (cutting edges) of ''Siamosaurus''{{'}}s teeth lack well-defined serrations.

It is unknown on which jaw the tooth was positioned nor which surface faced the inside or outside of the mouth. The tooth's front and back carinae are well-defined, though the former is not well preserved. Besides having a broader, {{Convert|20 by 14|mm||adj=on|abbr=on}} wide base and being slightly smaller at {{Convert|51|mm||abbr=on}} in length, GMNH-PV-999 has a very similar morphology to the ''Siamosaurus suteethorni'' holotype. Features shared between the two specimens include: a straight and only slightly compressed shape; a somewhat oval cross section; no serrations on the carinae (possibly due to bad preservation); and flutes on the crown surface, the Japan specimen having 12 on each side. The specimens also share a crown surface with numerous small granular structures oriented parallel to their lengths. Because of these resemblances, Hasegawa and colleagues regarded GMNH-PV-999 as nearly identical to the ''Siamosaurus suteethorni'' holotype tooth.<ref name=\":4\" />\n\nKDC-PV-0003, the second tooth found in the Sebayashi Formation, consists of a slightly recurved crown fragment with a preserved length of {{Convert|10|mm||abbr=on}}, the top and bottom of the tooth having broken off. At its base, the crown is {{Convert|7.4|mm||abbr=on}} long and {{Convert|6.8|mm||abbr=on}} wide, with an almost circular cross section. Though less complete than the former specimens, KDC-PV-0003 exhibits better preservation of small details such as visible serrations, although poorly defined ones. The denticles, of which there are two to three every {{Convert|1|mm||adj=on|abbr=on}}, are visible only on the front carinae, due to the rear of the tooth being obscured by rock [[Matrix (geology)|matrix]]. A {{Convert|5.5|mm||adj=on|abbr=on}} long gap at the fossil's base exposes the dentine, which is covered in a {{Convert|1.6|mm||adj=on|abbr=on}} thick layer of enamel. The little that is preserved of KDC-PV-0003 shows that like the first Sebayashi Formation tooth, it has a granular texture and a minimum of 12 flutes on its surface, not all of which stretch to the full length of the crown. The granular structures of KDC-PV-0003 are sharper than in GMNH-PV-999. The interdenticle sulci (tiny furrows near the gaps between each denticle) of KDC-PV-0003 have an [[Oblique angle|oblique]] orientation of 45 degrees, exactly like those seen in GMNH-PV-999.<ref name=\":5\" />\n\nOut of the four teeth referred to \"''Sinopliosaurus''\" ''fusuiensis'', specimen [[IVPP]] V 4793 is the most intact, although still somewhat deformed. The crown, which is missing its tip, is {{Convert|69|mm||abbr=on}} long and {{Convert|16.5 by 13|mm||abbr=on}} wide at the base. The tooth is straight, only slightly recurved, and has an oval cross section. The front and rear carinae are distinct, though their serrations have been heavily eroded, similar to those of KDC-PV-0003. Like the Thailand and Japan teeth, the \"''Sinopliosaurus''\" ''fusuiensis'' specimens bear developed flutes and a granular surface. As in both Sebayashi Formation teeth, there are 12 flutes on each face of \"''Sinopliosaurus''\" ''fusuiensis''{{'}}s teeth. Like in KDC-PV-0003, these flutes are of varied lengths. Buffetaut and colleagues likened the \"''Sinopliosaurus''\" ''fusuiensis'' teeth most to those of ''Siamosaurus'', given their identical crown shape, fluting, and granular enamel.<ref name=\"EBetal082\" />\n\n== Classification ==\n[[File:Spinosaurus_sp_Marocco_Cenom.JPG|thumb|Tooth of the related genus ''[[Spinosaurus]]'', Museo di Storia Naturale A. Stoppani, [[Lombardy]]]]\n\nIn 1986, Buffetaut and Ingavat classified ''Siamosaurus'' as a theropod because of the straight tall crown and double lateral recurvature of its teeth. At the time, ''Siamosaurus''{{'}}s particular combination of dental characteristics, especially the longitudinal fluting and lack of serrations, had not been observed in other theropods. The authors noted similarities in ''Siamosaurus''{{'}}s teeth to those of [[Ceratosauria|ceratosaurian]] tooth crowns, some of which also have longitudinal flutes. However, this identification was ruled out, since ceratosaur teeth differ in cross section, bear far fewer dental flutes, and have distinct serrations.

The study revealed that, among theropods, spinosaurid isotope ratios were closer to those of turtles and crocodilians. Thai spinosaurid teeth tended to have the largest difference from the ratios of other theropods, and those from Morocco tended to have the least difference. The authors concluded that spinosaurids, like modern crocodilians and hippopotamuses, were [[semiaquatic]] animals, and spent much of their daily lives in or near water. They also suggested that  piscivory and aquatic habits may explain how spinosaurids coexisted with other large theropods; by feeding on different prey items and occupying a distinct ecological role, a phenomenon known as [[niche partitioning]], the different types of theropods would have been out of direct competition.<ref name=\":21\" /><ref name=\"RMetal10\">{{cite journal |last=Amiot |first=R. |author2=Buffetaut, E. |author3=L\u00e9cuyer, C. |author4=Wang, X. |author5=Boudad, L. |author6=Ding, Z. |author7=Fourel, F. |author8=Hutt, S. |author9=Martineau, F. |author10=Medeiros, A. |author11=Mo, J. |author12=Simon, L. |author13=Suteethorn, V. |author14=Sweetman, S. |author15=Tong, H. |author16=Zhang, F. |author17=Zhou, Z. |year=2010 |title=Oxygen isotope evidence for semi-aquatic habits among spinosaurid theropods |journal=Geology |volume=38 |issue=2 |pages=139\u2013142 |doi=10.1130/G30402.1|bibcode=2010Geo....38..139A }}</ref>\n\n== Palaeoenvironment and palaeobiogeography ==\n[[File:Sao_Khua_Formation_V2.png|thumb|left|Restoration of ''Siamosaurus'' hunting fish in the Sao Khua Formation, with a herd of ''[[Phuwiangosaurus]]'' in the background]]\n\nThe sediments of the Sao Khua Formation, composed of [[Red clay|red clays]], [[Mudstone|mudstones]], [[Sandstone|sandstones]], [[Siltstone|siltstones]] and [[Conglomerate (geology)|conglomerate]] rocks, record a [[fluvial]] environment dominated by lakes, [[Floodplain|floodplains]], and meandering low-energy rivers.<ref name=\":12\" /><ref name=\":3\">{{Cite journal|last=Eric|first=Buffetaut|last2=Varavudh|first2=Suteethorn|date=1998|title=The biogeographical significance of the Mesozoic vertebrates from Thailand|url=http://doc.rero.ch/record/15441|journal=Biogeography and Geological Evolution of SE Asia|language=en}}</ref> This is consistent with the types of vertebrate fauna present in the formation, which comprise only terrestrial or freshwater animals, including dinosaurs, turtles, freshwater [[hybodont sharks]] and [[Actinopterygii|actinopterygian]] fishes, and the freshwater crocodilian ''[[Sunosuchus]]''.<ref name=\":1\" /> Besides ''Siamosaurus'', there were dinosaurs like the [[Metriacanthosauridae|metriacanthosaurid]] ''Siamotyrannus isanensis'',<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Carrano|first1=M.

The first reported spinosaurid from Asia, it is confidently known only from tooth [[Fossil|fossils]], the first of which were found in the [[Sao Khua Formation]], with more teeth later recovered from the younger [[Khok Kruat Formation]]. The [[type species]] '''''Siamosaurus suteethorni''''', whose name honours Thai [[palaeontologist]] [[Varavudh Suteethorn]], was formally described in [[1986 in paleontology|1986]]. One possible ''Siamosaurus'' tooth was discovered in the Japanese [[Sebayashi Formation]] in 1994, and a tooth similar to it was found at the same site in 2015. In 2009, four teeth from China's [[Xinlong Formation]] formerly thought to belong to a [[Pliosauroidea|pliosaur]] (under the species name '''\"''Sinopliosaurus''\" ''fusuiensis''''') were identified as those of a spinosaurid. \"''S''.\" ''fusuiensis'' may be the same animal as ''Siamosaurus''. Two partial spinosaurid skeletons have been found in Thailand, one in the Sao Khua and the other in the Khok Kruat Formation, but whether they belong to ''Siamosaurus'' or not is unclear.\n\nThe [[holotype]] tooth is {{Convert|62.5|mm|}} long and {{Convert|16.6 by 12.5|mm|}} wide at its base. Since it is a tooth [[taxon]], ''Siamosaurus''{{'}}s body size and weight are uncertain, though it has been estimated at between {{Convert|5.1 to 9.1|m||abbr=}} and weighing {{Convert|1|tonne|short ton}}. ''Siamosaurus''<nowiki/>'s teeth were straight, oval to circular in cross section, and lined with distinct lengthwise grooves. The tooth's [[Tooth enamel|enamel]] was wrinkled, similar to that of teeth from the related genus ''[[Baryonyx]]''. ''Siamosaurus''{{'}}s identity has been questioned by many palaeontologists, who argue that its teeth are too similar to those of contemporaneous aquatic reptiles for it to be confidently classed as a dinosaur. Other researchers, who agree that the teeth are spinosaur in origin, deem them too similar to those of other Early Cretaceous spinosaurs to  raise a new genus unequivocally. Based on characteristics of their teeth, ''Siamosaurus'' and \"''Sinopliosaurus''\" ''fusuiensis'' have been placed in the [[Spinosaurinae]] [[subfamily]].\n\nLike in all spinosaurids, ''Siamosaurus''{{'}}s teeth were conical, with reduced or absent [[Serration|serrations]]. This made them suitable for impaling rather than tearing flesh, a trait typically seen in largely [[piscivorous]] (fish-eating) animals. In addition, its relatives are known to have consumed [[Pterosaur|pterosaurs]] and small to medium-sized dinosaurs, and there is fossil evidence of ''Siamosaurus'' itself eating [[Sauropoda|sauropod]] dinosaurs, either via scavenging or active hunting. ''Siamosaurus'' lived in a [[Semi-arid climate|semi-arid]] habitat of [[Floodplain|floodplains]] and meandering rivers, where it coexisted with other theropod, sauropod, and (in at least the Khok Kruat Formation) [[Iguanodontia|iguanodontian]] dinosaurs. [[Isotope analysis]] of spinosaurid teeth indicates they may have had [[semiaquatic]] habits, and ''Siamosaurus''{{'}}s role as a largely piscivorous predator might have reduced the prominence of contemporaneous [[Crocodilia|crocodilians]] competing for the same food source.\n\n== History of discovery ==\n[[File:Cretaceous_strata_in_northeast_and_southeastern_Thailand.png|thumb|left|Geological map of the [[Khorat Plateau]] in northeast Thailand]]\n\nThe [[Sao Khua Formation]], where the first ''Siamosaurus'' [[Fossil|fossils]] were discovered, is part of the [[Khorat Group]].<ref name=\":0\">Buffetaut, E.; and Ingevat, R.

It is among the larger teeth discovered by Buffetaut and Ingavat, one much smaller specimen (DMR TF 2043b) measures {{Convert|24.3|mm||abbr=on}} in length. According to the authors, this dramatic size range suggests the teeth are from individuals of different ages. The holotype tooth is relatively straight, with only minor front to back curvature. It is oval in cross section while other specimens are nearly circular in this aspect. Unlike in most theropods, the [[Glossary of dinosaur anatomy#carinae|carinae]] (cutting edges) of ''Siamosaurus''{{'}}s teeth lack well-defined serrations.

The ''Siamosaurus'' morphotype also shares with ''Siamosaurus suteethorni'', GMNH-PV-999, and IVPP V 4793 a wrinkled enamel surface, and between 12 to 15 flutes on each side.''<ref name=\":24\" />''\n\n=== Possible material ===\n[[File:Sebayashi_spinosaurid_teeth.png|thumb|left|Partial tooth of an indeterminate spinosaurid (KDC-PV-0003) and possible ''Siamosaurus'' tooth (GMNH-PV-999), in the [[National Museum of Nature and Science]], Tokyo]]\n\nThe first Sebayashi Formation specimen (GMNH-PV-999) is an isolated tooth crown with a partially intact root. It is unknown on which jaw the tooth was positioned nor which surface faced the inside or outside of the mouth. The tooth's front and back carinae are well-defined, though the former is not well preserved. Besides having a broader, {{Convert|20 by 14|mm||adj=on|abbr=on}} wide base and being slightly smaller at {{Convert|51|mm||abbr=on}} in length, GMNH-PV-999 has a very similar morphology to the ''Siamosaurus suteethorni'' holotype. Features shared between the two specimens include: a straight and only slightly compressed shape; a somewhat oval cross section; no serrations on the carinae (possibly due to bad preservation); and flutes on the crown surface, the Japan specimen having 12 on each side. The specimens also share a crown surface with numerous small granular structures oriented parallel to their lengths. Because of these resemblances, Hasegawa and colleagues regarded GMNH-PV-999 as nearly identical to the ''Siamosaurus suteethorni'' holotype tooth.<ref name=\":4\" />\n\nKDC-PV-0003, the second tooth found in the Sebayashi Formation, consists of a slightly recurved crown fragment with a preserved length of {{Convert|10|mm||abbr=on}}, the top and bottom of the tooth having broken off. At its base, the crown is {{Convert|7.4|mm||abbr=on}} long and {{Convert|6.8|mm||abbr=on}} wide, with an almost circular cross section. Though less complete than the former specimens, KDC-PV-0003 exhibits better preservation of small details such as visible serrations, although poorly defined ones. The denticles, of which there are two to three every {{Convert|1|mm||adj=on|abbr=on}}, are visible only on the front carinae, due to the rear of the tooth being obscured by rock [[Matrix (geology)|matrix]]. A {{Convert|5.5|mm||adj=on|abbr=on}} long gap at the fossil's base exposes the dentine, which is covered in a {{Convert|1.6|mm||adj=on|abbr=on}} thick layer of enamel. The little that is preserved of KDC-PV-0003 shows that like the first Sebayashi Formation tooth, it has a granular texture and a minimum of 12 flutes on its surface, not all of which stretch to the full length of the crown. The granular structures of KDC-PV-0003 are sharper than in GMNH-PV-999. The interdenticle sulci (tiny furrows near the gaps between each denticle) of KDC-PV-0003 have an [[Oblique angle|oblique]] orientation of 45 degrees, exactly like those seen in GMNH-PV-999.<ref name=\":5\" />\n\nOut of the four teeth referred to \"''Sinopliosaurus''\" ''fusuiensis'', specimen [[IVPP]] V 4793 is the most intact, although still somewhat deformed. The crown, which is missing its tip, is {{Convert|69|mm||abbr=on}} long and {{Convert|16.5 by 13|mm||abbr=on}} wide at the base. The tooth is straight, only slightly recurved, and has an oval cross section. The front and rear carinae are distinct, though their serrations have been heavily eroded, similar to those of KDC-PV-0003. Like the Thailand and Japan teeth, the \"''Sinopliosaurus''\" ''fusuiensis'' specimens bear developed flutes and a granular surface. As in both Sebayashi Formation teeth, there are 12 flutes on each face of \"''Sinopliosaurus''\" ''fusuiensis''{{'}}s teeth. Like in KDC-PV-0003, these flutes are of varied lengths. Buffetaut and colleagues likened the \"''Sinopliosaurus''\" ''fusuiensis'' teeth most to those of ''Siamosaurus'', given their identical crown shape, fluting, and granular enamel.<ref name=\"EBetal082\" />\n\n== Classification ==\n[[File:Spinosaurus_sp_Marocco_Cenom.JPG|thumb|Tooth of the related genus ''[[Spinosaurus]]'', Museo di Storia Naturale A. Stoppani, [[Lombardy]]]]\n\nIn 1986, Buffetaut and Ingavat classified ''Siamosaurus'' as a theropod because of the straight tall crown and double lateral recurvature of its teeth. At the time, ''Siamosaurus''{{'}}s particular combination of dental characteristics, especially the longitudinal fluting and lack of serrations, had not been observed in other theropods. The authors noted similarities in ''Siamosaurus''{{'}}s teeth to those of [[Ceratosauria|ceratosaurian]] tooth crowns, some of which also have longitudinal flutes. However, this identification was ruled out, since ceratosaur teeth differ in cross section, bear far fewer dental flutes, and have distinct serrations. Buffetaut and Suteethorn concluded that the closest taxon in [[Glossary of dinosaur anatomy#dentition|dentition]] to ''Siamosaurus'' was ''[[Spinosaurus]]''. Like ''Siamosaurus,'' this African genus had straight and unserrated conical teeth, and though ''Spinosaurus'' lacked the developed flutes seen in ''Siamosaurus,'' Buffetaut and Ingavat noted that both smooth and fluted spinosaur teeth have been reported from Africa. Therefore, they tentatively placed ''Siamosaurus'' in the Spinosauridae [[Family (biology)|family]], based on close similarities in dentition to ''Spinosaurus aegyptiacus.<ref name=\":0\" />''<ref name=\":14\" />\n\nMany palaeontologists later questioned Buffetaut and Ingavat's identification of ''Siamosaurus'', given that spinosaurid teeth, including many from Asia, have often been mistaken for those of aquatic reptiles like crocodilians, plesiosaurs, and ichthyosaurs.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Buffetaut|first=Eric|date=2010|title=Spinosaurs before Stromer: early finds of spinosaurid dinosaurs and their interpretations|url=http://sp.lyellcollection.org/content/343/1/175|journal=Geological Society, London, Special Publications|language=en|volume=343|issue=1|pages=175\u2013188|bibcode=2010GSLSP.343..175B|doi=10.1144/SP343.10|issn=0305-8719|via=}}</ref> In view of this, the German palaeontologist [[Hans-Dieter Sues]] and colleagues in 2002 asserted that there is not enough material to confidently identify ''Siamosaurus'' as a dinosaur.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Sues|first=Hans-Dieter|last2=Frey|first2=Eberhard|last3=Martill|first3=David M.|last4=Scott|first4=Diane M.|date=2002|title=Irritator challengeri, a spinosaurid (Dinosauria: Theropoda) from the Lower Cretaceous of Brazil|url=|journal=Journal of Vertebrate Paleontology|language=en|volume=22|issue=3|pages=535\u2013547|doi=10.1671/0272-4634(2002)022[0535:icasdt]2.0.co;2|issn=0272-4634}}</ref> In 2004, American palaeontologist [[Thomas Holtz]] and colleagues considered it a [[dubious name]], stating that the teeth might instead belong to contemporaneous fish such as [[saurodontid]] or [[Ichthyodectidae|ichthyodectid]] [[Teleost|teleosts]].<ref name=\"HMC04\">Holtz Jr., T.R., Molnar, R.E., and Currie, P.J.

Lauprasert found that spinosaurids and crocodilians may have employed similar feeding tactics and been under comparable [[Constraint (classical mechanics)|mechanical constraints]], based on resemblances in the [[microstructure]] of their tooth enamel. Lauprasert suggested that ''Siamosaurus'' could have therefore replaced the [[ecological niche]] of contemporaneous long-snouted crocodilians as a piscivorous predator. He notes that this likely occurred in correlation with the rising aridity of the Sao Khua and Khok Kruat Formations during the Early Cretaceous, since ''Siamosaurus'' had better mobility in a dry environment than crocodilians did.

The study revealed that, among theropods, spinosaurid isotope ratios were closer to those of turtles and crocodilians. Thai spinosaurid teeth tended to have the largest difference from the ratios of other theropods, and those from Morocco tended to have the least difference. The authors concluded that spinosaurids, like modern crocodilians and hippopotamuses, were [[semiaquatic]] animals, and spent much of their daily lives in or near water. They also suggested that  piscivory and aquatic habits may explain how spinosaurids coexisted with other large theropods; by feeding on different prey items and occupying a distinct ecological role, a phenomenon known as [[niche partitioning]], the different types of theropods would have been out of direct competition.<ref name=\":21\" /><ref name=\"RMetal10\">{{cite journal |last=Amiot |first=R. |author2=Buffetaut, E. |author3=L\u00e9cuyer, C. |author4=Wang, X. |author5=Boudad, L. |author6=Ding, Z. |author7=Fourel, F. |author8=Hutt, S. |author9=Martineau, F. |author10=Medeiros, A. |author11=Mo, J. |author12=Simon, L. |author13=Suteethorn, V. |author14=Sweetman, S. |author15=Tong, H. |author16=Zhang, F. |author17=Zhou, Z. |year=2010 |title=Oxygen isotope evidence for semi-aquatic habits among spinosaurid theropods |journal=Geology |volume=38 |issue=2 |pages=139\u2013142 |doi=10.1130/G30402.1|bibcode=2010Geo....38..139A }}</ref>\n\n== Palaeoenvironment and palaeobiogeography ==\n[[File:Sao_Khua_Formation_V2.png|thumb|left|Restoration of ''Siamosaurus'' hunting fish in the Sao Khua Formation, with a herd of ''[[Phuwiangosaurus]]'' in the background]]\n\nThe sediments of the Sao Khua Formation, composed of [[Red clay|red clays]], [[Mudstone|mudstones]], [[Sandstone|sandstones]], [[Siltstone|siltstones]] and [[Conglomerate (geology)|conglomerate]] rocks, record a [[fluvial]] environment dominated by lakes, [[Floodplain|floodplains]], and meandering low-energy rivers.<ref name=\":12\" /><ref name=\":3\">{{Cite journal|last=Eric|first=Buffetaut|last2=Varavudh|first2=Suteethorn|date=1998|title=The biogeographical significance of the Mesozoic vertebrates from Thailand|url=http://doc.rero.ch/record/15441|journal=Biogeography and Geological Evolution of SE Asia|language=en}}</ref> This is consistent with the types of vertebrate fauna present in the formation, which comprise only terrestrial or freshwater animals, including dinosaurs, turtles, freshwater [[hybodont sharks]] and [[Actinopterygii|actinopterygian]] fishes, and the freshwater crocodilian ''[[Sunosuchus]]''.<ref name=\":1\" /> Besides ''Siamosaurus'', there were dinosaurs like the [[Metriacanthosauridae|metriacanthosaurid]] ''Siamotyrannus isanensis'',<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Carrano|first1=M.

The settlement in detail is left to you. You will inform the President of the above most secretly as soon as the outbreak of war with the United States of America is certain, and add the suggestion that he should, on his own initiative, invite Japan to immediate adherence and at the same time mediate between Japan and ourselves.

The Germans were encouraged by their successes on the [[Eastern Front (World War I)|Eastern Front]] into believing that they would be able to divert large numbers of troops to the Western Front in support of their goals. The Mexicans were willing to consider the alliance but declined the deal after Americans were informed of the Telegram.\n\n==Mexican response==\nMexican President [[Venustiano Carranza]] assigned a military commission to assess the feasibility of the Mexican takeover of their former territories contemplated by Germany.<ref>Katz (1981), p. 364.</ref> The generals concluded that it would be neither possible nor even desirable to attempt such an enterprise for the following reasons:\n\n* Mexico was in the midst of a civil war, and Carranza's position was far from secure. A declaration of war by his regime would have provided an opportunity for opposing factions to align with the United States and Allied Powers in exchange for diplomatic recognition. \n* The United States was far stronger militarily than Mexico was. Even if Mexico's military forces were completely united and loyal to a single regime, no serious scenario existed under which they could invade and win a war against the United States.\n* Germany's promises of \"generous financial support\" were very unreliable. The German government had already informed Carranza in June 1916 that they were unable to provide the necessary gold needed to stock a completely independent Mexican national bank.<ref name=\"William Beezley\">{{cite book | first1 = William | last1 = Beezley | first2 = Michael | last2 = Meyer | year = 2010 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=Amt1ZXMeVYMC&q=%22gold+to+stock%22#v=snippet&q=%22gold%20to%20stock%22&f=false | title = The Oxford History of Mexico | page = 476 | publisher = Oxford University Press | location = UK| isbn = 9780199779932 }}</ref> Even if Mexico received financial support, it would still need to purchase arms, ammunition, and other needed war supplies from the [[ABC nations]] (Argentina, Brazil, and Chile), which would strain relations with them, as explained below.\n* Even if by some chance Mexico had the military means to win a conflict against the United States and reclaim the territories in question, Mexico would have severe difficulty conquering and pacifying a large English-speaking population that was both used to self-government and [[Second Amendment to the United States Constitution|better supplied with arms]] than most other civilian populations.\n* Other foreign relations were at stake. The ABC nations organized the [[Niagara Falls peace conference]] in 1914 to avoid a full-scale war between the United States and Mexico over the [[United States occupation of Veracruz]]. If Mexico were to enter war against the United States, it would strain relations with those nations.\n\nThe Carranza government was recognized ''[[de jure]]'' by the United States on 31 August 1917 as a direct consequence of the Zimmermann telegram since recognition was necessary to ensure [[Mexico in World War I|Mexican neutrality in World War I]].<ref name=\"Thomas Paterson\">{{cite book | first1 = Thomas | last1 = Paterson | first2 = J.

The word ''Arizona'' was not in the German codebook and thus had to be split into phonetic syllables.]]\n\nZimmermann's office sent the telegram to the German embassy in the United States for re-transmission to Eckardt in Mexico. It has traditionally been claimed that the telegram was sent over three routes: transmitted by radio and also sent over two [[transatlantic telegraph cable| trans-Atlantic telegraph cables]] operated by neutral governments (the United States and Sweden) for the use of their diplomatic services, but it has been established that only one method was used. The Germans delivered the message to the [[Embassy of the United States, Berlin|United States embassy in Berlin]], and it then passed by [[diplomatic cable]] first to Copenhagen and then to London for onward transmission over transatlantic cable to Washington.<ref name=\"Gannon\">{{cite book | ref= Gannon | last= Gannon | first= Paul | title= Inside Room 40: The Codebreakers of World War I | location= London | publisher= Ian Allan Publishing | year= 2011 |isbn= 978-0-7110-3408-2}}</ref> [[William Reginald Hall]], the head of [[Room 40]], spread the misinformation about the \"three routes\" to try to conceal from the United States the fact that [[Room 40]] was intercepting its cable traffic.{{citation needed|date= May 2018}}\n\nDirect telegraph transmission of the telegram was impossible because the British had cut the German international cables at the outbreak of war. However, the United States allowed limited use of its diplomatic cables with Germany to communicate with its ambassador in Washington. The facility was supposed to be used for cables connected with President Woodrow Wilson's peace proposals.<ref name=\"Gannon\"/>\n\nThe Swedish cable ran from Sweden, and the United States cable from the United States embassy in [[Denmark]]. However, neither cable ran directly to the United States. Both cables passed through a relay station at [[Porthcurno]], near [[Land's End]], the westernmost tip of England. Here the signals were boosted for the long trans-oceanic jump. All traffic through the Porthcurno relay was copied to British intelligence, particularly to the [[cryptanalysis| codebreakers]] and analysts in [[Room 40]] at the [[Admiralty]].<ref name=\"SigSec\">{{cite book | author-link= Rupert Allason | last= West | first= Nigel | title= The Sigint Secrets: The Signals Intelligence War, 1990 to Today-Including the Persecution of Gordon Welchman | publisher= Quill | location= New York | year= 1990 | isbn= 0-688-09515-1 | pages = 83, 87\u201392}}</ref>\n\nAfter their telegraph cables had been cut, the German Foreign Office appealed to the United States for use of their cable for diplomatic messages. President Wilson agreed in the belief both that such co-operation would sustain continued good relations with Germany and that more efficient German-American diplomacy could assist Wilson's goal of a negotiated end to the war. The Germans handed in messages to the United States embassy in Berlin, which were relayed to the embassy in Denmark and then to the United States by American telegraph operators. However, the United States placed conditions on German usage, most notably that all messages had to be in clear, or uncoded. The Germans assumed that the cable was secure and used it extensively.<ref name=\"SigSec\"/>\n\nHowever, that put German diplomats in a precarious situation: they relied on the United States to transmit Zimmermann's note to its final destination, but the message's unencrypted contents would be deeply alarming to the Americans. The Germans persuaded [[United States Ambassador to Germany |US Ambassador]] [[James W. Gerard]] to accept it in coded form, and it was transmitted on 16 January 1917.<ref name=\"SigSec\"/>\n\nIn Room 40, [[Nigel de Grey]] had partially decoded the telegram by the next day.<ref name=\"Gannon\"/> By 1917, the diplomatic code 13040 had been along for many years\u2009and was old. Since Room 40 had had ample time to reconstruct it cryptanalytically, it was readable to a fair degree. Room 40 had previously obtained German cryptographic documents, including the diplomatic code 3512 (captured in the [[Mesopotamian campaign]]), which was a later, updated code, similar to, but not really related to code 13040, and naval code SKM (Signalbuch der Kaiserlichen Marine),\u2009\u2060useless for decoding the Zimmermann Telegram but valuable when it came to decoding naval traffic, which had been retrieved from the wrecked cruiser [[SMS Magdeburg|SMS ''Magdeburg'']] by the Russians, who passed it to the British.<ref>{{cite book | last1= Polmar | first1= Norman | last2=  Noot | first2= Jurrien | title= Submarines of the Russian and Soviet Navies 1718\u20131990 | location= Annapolis | publisher= US Naval Institute Press | year= 1991 | lastauthoramp= y | ref= Polmar}}</ref> \n\nDisclosure of the telegram would sway public opinion in the United States against Germany if the British could convince the Americans that the text was genuine, but Room 40 chief William Reginald Hall was reluctant to let it out because the disclosure would expose the German codes broken in Room 40 and British eavesdropping on the United States cable. Hall waited three weeks. During this period, de Grey and cryptographer [[William Montgomery (cryptographer) |William Montgomery]] completed the decryption. On 1 February Germany announced resumption of \"unrestricted\" submarine warfare, an act which led the United States to break off diplomatic relations with Germany on 3 February.<ref name=\"SigSec\"/>\n[[File:Zimmermann-telegramm-offen.jpg|thumb|The Telegram, completely decrypted and translated]]\n\nHall passed the telegram to the British Foreign Office on 5 February, but still warned against releasing it. Meanwhile, the British discussed possible cover stories which would serve to explain to the Americans how they obtained the coded text of the telegram without admitting to their ability to intercept American diplomatic communications, which they would continue to do for another 25 years, and also to explain how they obtained the cleartext of the telegram without letting the Germans know that their codes were broken. Furthermore, the British needed to find a way to convince the Americans the message was not a forgery.<ref name=BBC2017>\n{{cite news\n|title= Why was the Zimmerman Telegram so important?\n|url= https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-38581861\n|accessdate= 17 January 2017|work= BBC\n|date= 17 January 2017\n}}\n</ref>\n\nFor the first story, the British obtained the coded text of the telegram from the Mexican commercial telegraph office. The British knew that since the German embassy in Washington would relay the message by commercial telegraph, the Mexican telegraph office would have the coded text. ''\"Mr. H\"'', a British agent in Mexico, bribed an employee of the commercial telegraph company for a copy of the message. (Sir [[Thomas Hohler]], the British ambassador in Mexico, claimed to have been ''\"Mr. H\"'' or at least involved with the interception in his autobiography.{{citation needed|date= May 2018}}) That coded text could be shown to the Americans without embarrassment.\n\nMoreover, the retransmission was encoded with the older code 13040 and so by mid-February, the British had not only the complete text but also the ability to release the telegram without revealing the extent to which the latest German codes had been broken. (At worst, the Germans might have realized that the 13040 code had been compromised, but that was a risk worth taking against the possibility of United States entry into the war.) Finally, since copies of the 13040 codetext would also have been deposited in the records of the American commercial telegraph company, the British had the ability to prove the authenticity of the message to the United States government.<ref name=BBCHistory2017/>\n\nAs a cover story, the British could publicly claim that their agents had stolen the telegram's decoded text in Mexico. Privately, the British needed to give the Americans the 13040 code so that the United States government could verify the authenticity of the message independently with their own commercial telegraphic records, but the Americans agreed to back the official cover story. The German Foreign Office refused to consider a possible code break and instead sent Ambassador Eckardt on a witch-hunt for a traitor in the embassy in Mexico. (Eckardt indignantly rejected the accusations, and the Foreign Office eventually declared the embassy exonerated.)<ref name=\"SigSec\"/>\n\n===Use===\nOn 19 February, Hall showed the telegram to Edward Bell, secretary of the United States Embassy in Britain. Bell, at first incredulous, thought that it was a forgery. Once Bell was convinced the message was genuine, he became enraged. On 20 February, Hall informally sent a copy to United States Ambassador [[Walter Hines Page]]. On 23 February, Page met with British Foreign Minister [[Arthur James Balfour|Arthur Balfour]] and was given the codetext, the message in German, and the English translation. Page then reported the story to President [[Woodrow Wilson]], including details to be verified from telegraph-company files in the United States. Wilson released the text to the media on 28 February 1917.\n\n==American response==\n[[File:Cartoon for a Telegram.jpg|thumb|210px|1917 political cartoon about the Zimmermann Telegram]]\nPopular sentiment in the United States at that time was [[anti-Mexican sentiment|anti-Mexican]] as well as [[anti-German sentiment|anti-German]], and in Mexico there was considerable [[anti-American sentiment]].<ref>{{cite book |ref= Link |last= Link |first= Arthur S. |title= Wilson: Campaigns for Progressivism and Peace: 1916\u20131917 |year= 1965 |url= http://quod.lib.umich.edu/cgi/t/text/text-idx?c=acls;idno=heb01547.0005.001;rgn=full%20text;view=toc;cc=acls}}</ref> General [[John J.

News of the telegram further inflamed tensions between the United States and Mexico.\n[[File:Exploding in his Hands.jpg|left|thumb|225x225px|\"Exploding in his Hands\"]]\nHowever, there was also a notable [[anti-British sentiment]] in the United States, particularly among [[German Americans|German-]] and [[Irish American|Irish-Americans]]. Many Americans wished to avoid the conflict in Europe. Since the public had been told falsely that the telegram had been stolen in a decoded form in Mexico, the message was widely believed at first to be an elaborate forgery perpetrated by British intelligence. That belief, which was not restricted to pacifist and pro-German lobbies, was promoted by German and Mexican diplomats and by some American newspapers, especially the [[Hearst Corporation|Hearst]] press empire. That presented the Wilson administration with a dilemma. With the evidence the United States had been provided confidentially by the British, Wilson realized the message was genuine but he could not make the evidence public without compromising the British codebreaking operation.\n\nAny doubts as to the authenticity of the telegram were removed by Zimmermann himself. At a press conference on 3 March 1917, he told an American journalist, \"I cannot deny it. It is true.\" Then, on 29 March 1917, Zimmermann gave a speech in the [[Reichstag (German Empire)|Reichstag]] in which he admitted the telegram was genuine.<ref>{{cite journal |ref= Meyer |last= Meyer |first= Michael C. |title= The Mexican-German Conspiracy of 1915 |journal= The Americas |volume= 23 |issue= 1  |pages= 76\u201389 |year=1966 |doi=10.2307/980141|jstor= 980141 }}</ref> Zimmermann hoped that Americans would understand that the idea was that Germany would only fund Mexico's war with the United States in the prior event of American entry into World War I.\n\nOn 1 February 1917, Germany began unrestricted submarine warfare against all ships in the Atlantic bearing the American flag, both passenger and merchant ships.  Two ships were sunk in February, and most American shipping companies held their ships in port. Besides the highly provocative war proposal to Mexico, the telegram also mentioned \"ruthless employment of our submarines\". Public opinion demanded action. Wilson had previously refused to assign US Navy crews and guns to the merchant ships. However, once the Zimmermann note was public, Wilson called for arming the merchant ships, but [[anti-war]] elements in the [[United States Senate]] blocked his proposal.<ref>{{cite book | first = Richard W | last = Leopold | title = The Growth of American Foreign Policy: A History | year = 1962 | pages = 330\u201331 | publisher = Random House}}</ref>\n\nOn 6 April 1917, Congress voted to [[United States declaration of war on Germany (1917)|declare war on Germany]]; Wilson had asked [[United States Congress|Congress]] for \"a [[The war to end war|war to end all wars]]\" that would \"make the world safe for democracy\".<ref>{{cite book |first=Arthur S. |last=Link |title=Woodrow Wilson and the Progressive Era, 1910\u20131917 |year=1972 |location=New York |publisher=Harper & Row |pages=252\u2013282 |isbn= }}</ref>\n\nWoodrow Wilson considered another military invasion of Veracruz and [[Tampico]] in 1917\u20131918,<ref name=\"Ernest Gruening\">{{cite book | first = Ernest | last = Gruening | year = 1968 | url = https://books.google.com/?id=VoBlAAAAMAAJ&q=occupation+president+wilson | title = Mexico and Its Heritage | page = 596 | publisher = Greenwood Press | location = U.S.}}</ref><ref name=\"Halevy\">{{cite book | first = Drew Philip | last = Halevy | year = 2000 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=WOfKxFigGSwC | title = Threats of Intervention: U.

A declaration of war by his regime would have provided an opportunity for opposing factions to align with the United States and Allied Powers in exchange for diplomatic recognition. \n* The United States was far stronger militarily than Mexico was. Even if Mexico's military forces were completely united and loyal to a single regime, no serious scenario existed under which they could invade and win a war against the United States.\n* Germany's promises of \"generous financial support\" were very unreliable.

The ABC nations organized the [[Niagara Falls peace conference]] in 1914 to avoid a full-scale war between the United States and Mexico over the [[United States occupation of Veracruz]]. If Mexico were to enter war against the United States, it would strain relations with those nations.\n\nThe Carranza government was recognized ''[[de jure]]'' by the United States on 31 August 1917 as a direct consequence of the Zimmermann telegram since recognition was necessary to ensure [[Mexico in World War I|Mexican neutrality in World War I]].<ref name=\"Thomas Paterson\">{{cite book | first1 = Thomas | last1 = Paterson | first2 = J.

The Germans delivered the message to the [[Embassy of the United States, Berlin|United States embassy in Berlin]], and it then passed by [[diplomatic cable]] first to Copenhagen and then to London for onward transmission over transatlantic cable to Washington.<ref name=\"Gannon\">{{cite book | ref= Gannon | last= Gannon | first= Paul | title= Inside Room 40: The Codebreakers of World War I | location= London | publisher= Ian Allan Publishing | year= 2011 |isbn= 978-0-7110-3408-2}}</ref> [[William Reginald Hall]], the head of [[Room 40]], spread the misinformation about the \"three routes\" to try to conceal from the United States the fact that [[Room 40]] was intercepting its cable traffic.{{citation needed|date= May 2018}}\n\nDirect telegraph transmission of the telegram was impossible because the British had cut the German international cables at the outbreak of war. However, the United States allowed limited use of its diplomatic cables with Germany to communicate with its ambassador in Washington. The facility was supposed to be used for cables connected with President Woodrow Wilson's peace proposals.<ref name=\"Gannon\"/>\n\nThe Swedish cable ran from Sweden, and the United States cable from the United States embassy in [[Denmark]]. However, neither cable ran directly to the United States. Both cables passed through a relay station at [[Porthcurno]], near [[Land's End]], the westernmost tip of England. Here the signals were boosted for the long trans-oceanic jump. All traffic through the Porthcurno relay was copied to British intelligence, particularly to the [[cryptanalysis| codebreakers]] and analysts in [[Room 40]] at the [[Admiralty]].<ref name=\"SigSec\">{{cite book | author-link= Rupert Allason | last= West | first= Nigel | title= The Sigint Secrets: The Signals Intelligence War, 1990 to Today-Including the Persecution of Gordon Welchman | publisher= Quill | location= New York | year= 1990 | isbn= 0-688-09515-1 | pages = 83, 87\u201392}}</ref>\n\nAfter their telegraph cables had been cut, the German Foreign Office appealed to the United States for use of their cable for diplomatic messages. President Wilson agreed in the belief both that such co-operation would sustain continued good relations with Germany and that more efficient German-American diplomacy could assist Wilson's goal of a negotiated end to the war. The Germans handed in messages to the United States embassy in Berlin, which were relayed to the embassy in Denmark and then to the United States by American telegraph operators. However, the United States placed conditions on German usage, most notably that all messages had to be in clear, or uncoded. The Germans assumed that the cable was secure and used it extensively.<ref name=\"SigSec\"/>\n\nHowever, that put German diplomats in a precarious situation: they relied on the United States to transmit Zimmermann's note to its final destination, but the message's unencrypted contents would be deeply alarming to the Americans. The Germans persuaded [[United States Ambassador to Germany |US Ambassador]] [[James W. Gerard]] to accept it in coded form, and it was transmitted on 16 January 1917.<ref name=\"SigSec\"/>\n\nIn Room 40, [[Nigel de Grey]] had partially decoded the telegram by the next day.<ref name=\"Gannon\"/> By 1917, the diplomatic code 13040 had been along for many years\u2009and was old. Since Room 40 had had ample time to reconstruct it cryptanalytically, it was readable to a fair degree. Room 40 had previously obtained German cryptographic documents, including the diplomatic code 3512 (captured in the [[Mesopotamian campaign]]), which was a later, updated code, similar to, but not really related to code 13040, and naval code SKM (Signalbuch der Kaiserlichen Marine),\u2009\u2060useless for decoding the Zimmermann Telegram but valuable when it came to decoding naval traffic, which had been retrieved from the wrecked cruiser [[SMS Magdeburg|SMS ''Magdeburg'']] by the Russians, who passed it to the British.<ref>{{cite book | last1= Polmar | first1= Norman | last2=  Noot | first2= Jurrien | title= Submarines of the Russian and Soviet Navies 1718\u20131990 | location= Annapolis | publisher= US Naval Institute Press | year= 1991 | lastauthoramp= y | ref= Polmar}}</ref> \n\nDisclosure of the telegram would sway public opinion in the United States against Germany if the British could convince the Americans that the text was genuine, but Room 40 chief William Reginald Hall was reluctant to let it out because the disclosure would expose the German codes broken in Room 40 and British eavesdropping on the United States cable. Hall waited three weeks. During this period, de Grey and cryptographer [[William Montgomery (cryptographer) |William Montgomery]] completed the decryption. On 1 February Germany announced resumption of \"unrestricted\" submarine warfare, an act which led the United States to break off diplomatic relations with Germany on 3 February.<ref name=\"SigSec\"/>\n[[File:Zimmermann-telegramm-offen.jpg|thumb|The Telegram, completely decrypted and translated]]\n\nHall passed the telegram to the British Foreign Office on 5 February, but still warned against releasing it. Meanwhile, the British discussed possible cover stories which would serve to explain to the Americans how they obtained the coded text of the telegram without admitting to their ability to intercept American diplomatic communications, which they would continue to do for another 25 years, and also to explain how they obtained the cleartext of the telegram without letting the Germans know that their codes were broken. Furthermore, the British needed to find a way to convince the Americans the message was not a forgery.<ref name=BBC2017>\n{{cite news\n|title= Why was the Zimmerman Telegram so important?\n|url= https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-38581861\n|accessdate= 17 January 2017|work= BBC\n|date= 17 January 2017\n}}\n</ref>\n\nFor the first story, the British obtained the coded text of the telegram from the Mexican commercial telegraph office. The British knew that since the German embassy in Washington would relay the message by commercial telegraph, the Mexican telegraph office would have the coded text. ''\"Mr. H\"'', a British agent in Mexico, bribed an employee of the commercial telegraph company for a copy of the message. (Sir [[Thomas Hohler]], the British ambassador in Mexico, claimed to have been ''\"Mr. H\"'' or at least involved with the interception in his autobiography.{{citation needed|date= May 2018}}) That coded text could be shown to the Americans without embarrassment.\n\nMoreover, the retransmission was encoded with the older code 13040 and so by mid-February, the British had not only the complete text but also the ability to release the telegram without revealing the extent to which the latest German codes had been broken. (At worst, the Germans might have realized that the 13040 code had been compromised, but that was a risk worth taking against the possibility of United States entry into the war.) Finally, since copies of the 13040 codetext would also have been deposited in the records of the American commercial telegraph company, the British had the ability to prove the authenticity of the message to the United States government.<ref name=BBCHistory2017/>\n\nAs a cover story, the British could publicly claim that their agents had stolen the telegram's decoded text in Mexico. Privately, the British needed to give the Americans the 13040 code so that the United States government could verify the authenticity of the message independently with their own commercial telegraphic records, but the Americans agreed to back the official cover story. The German Foreign Office refused to consider a possible code break and instead sent Ambassador Eckardt on a witch-hunt for a traitor in the embassy in Mexico. (Eckardt indignantly rejected the accusations, and the Foreign Office eventually declared the embassy exonerated.)<ref name=\"SigSec\"/>\n\n===Use===\nOn 19 February, Hall showed the telegram to Edward Bell, secretary of the United States Embassy in Britain. Bell, at first incredulous, thought that it was a forgery. Once Bell was convinced the message was genuine, he became enraged. On 20 February, Hall informally sent a copy to United States Ambassador [[Walter Hines Page]]. On 23 February, Page met with British Foreign Minister [[Arthur James Balfour|Arthur Balfour]] and was given the codetext, the message in German, and the English translation. Page then reported the story to President [[Woodrow Wilson]], including details to be verified from telegraph-company files in the United States. Wilson released the text to the media on 28 February 1917.\n\n==American response==\n[[File:Cartoon for a Telegram.jpg|thumb|210px|1917 political cartoon about the Zimmermann Telegram]]\nPopular sentiment in the United States at that time was [[anti-Mexican sentiment|anti-Mexican]] as well as [[anti-German sentiment|anti-German]], and in Mexico there was considerable [[anti-American sentiment]].<ref>{{cite book |ref= Link |last= Link |first= Arthur S. |title= Wilson: Campaigns for Progressivism and Peace: 1916\u20131917 |year= 1965 |url= http://quod.lib.umich.edu/cgi/t/text/text-idx?c=acls;idno=heb01547.0005.001;rgn=full%20text;view=toc;cc=acls}}</ref> General [[John J.

News of the telegram further inflamed tensions between the United States and Mexico.\n[[File:Exploding in his Hands.jpg|left|thumb|225x225px|\"Exploding in his Hands\"]]\nHowever, there was also a notable [[anti-British sentiment]] in the United States, particularly among [[German Americans|German-]] and [[Irish American|Irish-Americans]]. Many Americans wished to avoid the conflict in Europe. Since the public had been told falsely that the telegram had been stolen in a decoded form in Mexico, the message was widely believed at first to be an elaborate forgery perpetrated by British intelligence. That belief, which was not restricted to pacifist and pro-German lobbies, was promoted by German and Mexican diplomats and by some American newspapers, especially the [[Hearst Corporation|Hearst]] press empire. That presented the Wilson administration with a dilemma. With the evidence the United States had been provided confidentially by the British, Wilson realized the message was genuine but he could not make the evidence public without compromising the British codebreaking operation.\n\nAny doubts as to the authenticity of the telegram were removed by Zimmermann himself. At a press conference on 3 March 1917, he told an American journalist, \"I cannot deny it. It is true.\" Then, on 29 March 1917, Zimmermann gave a speech in the [[Reichstag (German Empire)|Reichstag]] in which he admitted the telegram was genuine.<ref>{{cite journal |ref= Meyer |last= Meyer |first= Michael C. |title= The Mexican-German Conspiracy of 1915 |journal= The Americas |volume= 23 |issue= 1  |pages= 76\u201389 |year=1966 |doi=10.2307/980141|jstor= 980141 }}</ref> Zimmermann hoped that Americans would understand that the idea was that Germany would only fund Mexico's war with the United States in the prior event of American entry into World War I.\n\nOn 1 February 1917, Germany began unrestricted submarine warfare against all ships in the Atlantic bearing the American flag, both passenger and merchant ships.  Two ships were sunk in February, and most American shipping companies held their ships in port. Besides the highly provocative war proposal to Mexico, the telegram also mentioned \"ruthless employment of our submarines\". Public opinion demanded action. Wilson had previously refused to assign US Navy crews and guns to the merchant ships. However, once the Zimmermann note was public, Wilson called for arming the merchant ships, but [[anti-war]] elements in the [[United States Senate]] blocked his proposal.<ref>{{cite book | first = Richard W | last = Leopold | title = The Growth of American Foreign Policy: A History | year = 1962 | pages = 330\u201331 | publisher = Random House}}</ref>\n\nOn 6 April 1917, Congress voted to [[United States declaration of war on Germany (1917)|declare war on Germany]]; Wilson had asked [[United States Congress|Congress]] for \"a [[The war to end war|war to end all wars]]\" that would \"make the world safe for democracy\".<ref>{{cite book |first=Arthur S. |last=Link |title=Woodrow Wilson and the Progressive Era, 1910\u20131917 |year=1972 |location=New York |publisher=Harper & Row |pages=252\u2013282 |isbn= }}</ref>\n\nWoodrow Wilson considered another military invasion of Veracruz and [[Tampico]] in 1917\u20131918,<ref name=\"Ernest Gruening\">{{cite book | first = Ernest | last = Gruening | year = 1968 | url = https://books.google.com/?id=VoBlAAAAMAAJ&q=occupation+president+wilson | title = Mexico and Its Heritage | page = 596 | publisher = Greenwood Press | location = U.S.}}</ref><ref name=\"Halevy\">{{cite book | first = Drew Philip | last = Halevy | year = 2000 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=WOfKxFigGSwC | title = Threats of Intervention: U.

Although he has managed to sustain an athletic physique in his career as an actor, Crews has avoided being type-cast as a muscle-bound action hero and has attained critical success through exploiting the contrast of his elaborate character comedy with his physique, which extends to the point of even mocking the stereotype of the gym-obsessed bodybuilder.

While not lazy, he is very laid-back, often seen sleeping. Manji also has a strange sense of \"honour\" that is in many ways similar to the fighting-ethic of the Itto-Ryu. The fallen [[samurai]] Manji served the ''[[Hatamoto]]'' Horii Shigenobu, a local [[daimy\u014d]], enforcing his brutal rule (unknowingly) on the local populace until he found out his lord was corrupt and killed him. For that he was considered an outlaw and hunted down by the same daimy\u014d clan, achieving the nickname \"''Killer of 100''\" after the body count. He planned to flee to his sister's house even though she had married an officer of the law, Sait\u014d Tatsumasa. Manji ended up killing his sister's husband out of self-defense when he attacked Manji. His sister witnessed her husband's death at the hands of her brother and went insane, reverting to a child-like mindset. Manji settled down to take care of her. At some point during this time, he met Yaobikuni (her name literally means \"nun of eight hundred years\"), a mysterious [[nun]], who gave him the kessen-chu, or sacred bloodworms that made him immortal. Despite the obvious advantages of being nearly invincible, Manji dislikes being immortal. He tries to get Yaobikuni to remove the kessen-chu, finally making a deal with her. He has to kill 1000 bad men, to make up for the 100 good men he killed, if he does this, Yaobikuni will rid him of his immortality. It's worth noting, one reason he doesn't like being immortal is he feels it is making his swordsmanship rusty, because he doesn't have to be as good to win. After his sister is killed (due to a revenge for his actions) he met Rin, whom he accepted to help since he felt she was very much alike to his deceased sister. Manji is constantly trying to make amends for his past actions: he kills his lord to atone for those he killed on the Damiyo's orders; looked after his sister to atone for the deaths of the one hundred cops he killed; and makes the deal to kill one thousand bad men and to look after Rin to make amends for the death of his sister; he takes his role as her protector/surrogate older-brother seriously. However each time Manji tries to do something \"good\", he tends to only make the situation worse (the death of his lord leading to the deaths of one hundred cops, for example).\n\n:He uses many weapons, a good number of which came from defeated opponents. His two short, hooked swords are named Shid\u014d (four paths). His two standard swords are named Imo-no-Kami Tatsumasa (Sister Defender Tatsumasa). His two chained scythes are called Mumei (nameless). His double bladed sword-breaker is named Kotengu (Little devil).  Most of his weapons are hidden under his shirt, a seemingly impossible feat given their large number, irregular shapes and lack of sheaths.  One of Manji's signature tricks is to make any of his hidden weapons drop out of his sleeves into one or both of his waiting hands whenever they are needed.\n\n:He first appears in ''Criminal''.\n\n* {{nihongo|'''Rin Asano'''|\u6d45\u91ce \u51db|Asano Rin}} {{anime voices|[[Rina Sat\u014d]] (2008 anime), [[Ayane Sakura]] (2019 anime)<ref name=\"2019-cast\"/>|[[Mela Lee]]}}\n\n:The sole survivor of an Itt\u014d-ry\u016b massacre at Anotsu's hand and heir to her father's sword school, the \"Mutenichi-ry\u016b\". She has mediocre swordsmanship skills but an intense desire to avenge the brutal death of her family. At the beginning of the series she is portrayed as somebody who is trying to act mature, but is still very childish - as the series progresses she steadily \"grows up\" and loses much of her naivety. She hires Manji as her bodyguard in this quest. However, it's not as simple as that - Rin is constantly torn by doubt over the righteousness and validity of her mission and fears becoming a hypocrite as Anotsu claims that she is more like the Itt\u014d-ry\u016b, especially when he remarks she chooses to use throwing knives instead of a sword like the \"Mutenichi-ry\u016b\" teaches. She meets Anotsu at one point, but he claims that she is more like the Itt\u014d-ry\u016b as she continues her path for revenge. Anotsu's words is causing her to doubt.  When she finally encounters Anotsu in Kaga, she realizes she cannot defeat him and winds up traveling with him. If he starts to trust her, she might get the chance she wants to kill him. But Anotsu is no fool and is fully aware of what she is doing, despite this he allows her presence. She has since left his company, vowing that she will eventually kill him; yet she will stand back for the time being and watch how the events unfold. It is also worth noting that she kisses a sleeping Manji in the fourteenth volume, Last Blood, and has shown on numerous occasions that she develops feelings towards him.  They are as of now largely unreciprocated. She has three weapons, a Chinese sword named Kutoneshirika which she carries in a Toju (purse-like scabbard of sorts), a [[Tant\u014d]] type dagger and a set of small throwing daggers named Ogunchu (Golden Wasps). Even though she is only mediocre in terms of fighting ability, Rin is still more skilled with weapons than most women of that time period and the fact that she carries a small arsenal of weapons with her makes her somewhat unique.  She first appears in ''Conquest'' part 1.\n\n==Itt\u014d-ry\u016b==\n* {{nihongo|'''Kagehisa Anotsu'''|\u5929\u6d25 \u5f71\u4e45|Anotsu Kagehisa}} {{anime voices|[[Hirofumi Nojima]] (2008 anime), [[Nozomu Sasaki]] (2019 anime)<ref name=\"2019-cast-2\">{{cite web|url=https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2019-08-24/new-blade-of-the-immortal-anime-reveals-6-new-cast-members/.150348|title=New Blade of the Immortal Anime Reveals 6 New Cast Members|publisher=[[Anime News Network]]|date=2019-08-24|accessdate=2019-08-24}}</ref>|[[Ezra Weisz]]}}\n\n: Leader of the Itt\u014d-ry\u016b and equal of Manji. While painted as the \"villain\" of the series at the start, he has had many scenes devoted to making the reader sympathetic to his views and goals.  An emotionally cold young man has prodigious skill with the sword, and leads the Itt\u014d-ry\u016b in order to form a d\u014dj\u014d dedicated not to form and rules, but to the simple test of superior lethality. Brought up by an abusive grandfather (a swordsman disgraced by the Asano d\u014dj\u014d), Anotsu is as pragmatic and shrewd as he is deadly. He isn't as inhuman as originally believed, as he even allows Rin to live after she attacks him; even letting her follow him everywhere. He is currently at \"war\" with Habaki Kagimura, the leader of the Banshu. Alongside Manji and Makie Otono-Tachibana, Anotsu confronts Habaki Kagimura and his Rokki-Dan in Nakaminato. He eventually slays Habaki in a tightly-contested duel, but is too exhausted to mount a challenge in the subsequent duel with Manji. Manji spares his life but Anotsu is fatally stabbed by Rin during his escape, although it's later hinted that he may have survived the attack. He has two weapons. The first, his main weapon, is a Nepalese-based axe named Kabutsuchi (Head Hammer). The other is his rarely used sword of the same name. First appears in ''Conquest'' part 1.\n\n* {{nihongo|'''Taito Magatsu'''|\u51f6 \u6234\u6597|Magatsu Taito}} {{anime voices|[[Kazuya Nakai]] (2008 anime), [[Tatsuhisa Suzuki]] (2019 anime)<ref name=\"2019-cast-2\"/>|[[Derek Stephen Prince]]}}\n\n: Among the Itt\u014d-ry\u016b's finest swordsmen. Of peasant origin, he became a swordsman to avenge his sister, who was killed as a child by a samurai. Taito is one of the few swordsmen who has fought Manji and survived. He has also fought by Manji's side as well. He can be considered a kenshi, a swordsman who is not from the [[samurai]] class.  He despises the government by extension to his hatred of samurai and quits the Itto-ryu when Anotsu allies the group with Kagimura and the shogunate, though he remains on friendly terms with Anotsu.  When his lover of sorts, a prostitute named O-Ren, is killed by Shira, Magatsu ends up following Manji around due to the fact that he knows Shira is after Manji. Although they argue a lot, Manji and Taito have a relatively friendly relationship. In the end Manji allows Taito to find Shira, and despite how much Shira wants to kill Manji, he lets Taito get him. Eventually Shira loses the one hand he had left to Taito and presumably falls to his death.  Concerned by something Shira said, Taito decides to meet up with Anotsu and he eventually rejoins the Itt\u014d-ry\u016b.  Magatsu later joins Manji and Meguro to finally finish off Shira.  Taito's weapon is a gladius-like triple-sectioned sword named Grand Turk. The main blade is a gladius, the second is a smaller, shorter sword hidden in the handle, the last is a spear-head like dagger hidden within the pommel of the second blade. The sword is curiously missing a sword guard. First appears in ''Conquest'' part 1, first named in ''Fanatic'' part 1.\n\n* {{nihongo|'''Makie Otono-Tachibana'''|\u4e59\u6a58 \u69c7\u7d75|Otono-Tachibana Makie}} {{anime voices|[[Mamiko Noto]] (2008 anime), [[Houko Kuwashima]] (2019 anime)<ref name=\"2019-cast-2\"/>|[[Laura Bailey (voice actress)|Laura Bailey]]}}\n\n: Master swordswoman and in love with Anotsu.  Possibly the most skilled swordsfighter in the manga, she is said to be Anotsu's match and saved his life with her deadly abilities when they were children. Born into a samurai family, Makie and her mother {{nihongo|Fuki|\u4e59\u6a58\u5439|''Otono-Tachibana Fuki''}} were disowned and cast away from the family by her father, {{nihongo|Harukawa|\u6625\u5ddd\u7fa9\u660e|''Harukawa Yoshiaki''}}, when Makie's older brother committed [[seppuku]] after Makie was revealed to have inherited the family's famed talent and he was unable to defeat her in combat. She initially choose the path of the sword to avenge her mother's disgrace. She ended up becoming a [[geisha]] after Anotsu bought her freedom because she neither had the nerve to become a prostitute, like her mother, nor commit to becoming a swordfighter, lacking the nerve to kill when her concentration in battle is broken.  She defeats, but does not kill Manji, apparently turning her back on Anotsu. Later found living alone, having bound her hand in an attempt to destroy her own skill in combat after her father's humiliating death. She reappears in Last Blood, having followed Anotsu since he left Shirakawa when she realized his body was weakening, and destroys the nearly all men under Iriya who were pursuing Anotsu. After Iriya's death, she leaves with Anotsu and Magatsu.  She is later stricken with the same lung sickness her father died from while quietly residing with Anotsu and acting as his bodyguard.  When he departs from Edo during Habaki's last effort to destroy the Itto-ryu, Anotsu leaves her behind in order to spare her from fighting again.  However, she pursues him in spite of how her sickness is advancing until she encounters Habaki and the Rokki-dan, where upon she is reunited with Anotsu and Manji and fights alongside them.  As said by Anotsu, she is the only one that can beat him other than Manji, and even Habaki immediately recognizes and fears her skill. Makie is fatally wounded during an ambush by Hanabusa's forces, but manages to kill them all before dying. Her weapon, a double bladed three-section-staff, is named Haru-no-Okina (Old Man of Spring). She conceals her weapon in a hollowed-out [[shamisen]], a mandolin-like instrument. She first appears in ''Dreamsong'' Part 1.\n\n===Other Itt\u014d-ry\u016b===\n* {{nihongo|'''S\u014dsuke Abayama'''|\u963f\u8449\u5c71 \u5b97\u4ecb|Abayama S\u014dsuke}} {{anime voices|[[Shinya Fukumatsu]] (2019 anime)<ref name=\"2019-cast-2\"/>}}\n: Second-in-command of the Itt\u014d-ry\u016b. An aged swordsman who nevertheless remains one of the Itt\u014d-ry\u016b's most skilled fighters. A skilled political operative, well suited to handling the d\u014dj\u014d's administrative tasks. He is missing his right arm, and uses a concealed dagger/machete-like weapon with a strange hilt. His missing right arm is actually replaced by three chains with weights which he uses as a weapon against Giichi. He is critically injured by Giichi after an intense battle during the Rokki-Dan pursuit. In the final chapters of the manga, Giichi stumbles upon Abayama, in a decrepit state, being treated by his granddaughter, making him one of the few survivors of the Itt\u014d-ry\u016b.\n\n* {{nihongo|'''Sabato Kuroi'''|\u9ed2\u8863 \u9bd6\u4eba|Kuroi Sabato}} {{anime voices|[[Masashi Ebara]] (2008 anime), Eiji Hanawa (2019 anime)<ref name=\"2019-cast-2\"/>|Artt Butler}}\n\n: Skilled pupil of Anotsu Sabur\u014d (Anotsu Kagehisa's grandfather) and master Itt\u014d-ry\u016b swordsman. Along with his skills with a sword, Kuroi has several quirks, which includes poetry referencing [[Black Sabbath]] appearing whenever he does. In addition, Kuroi is so obsessed with ageless beauty that he used taxidermy to preserve the heads of his former wife and Rin's mother, and mounted them on his shoulders. Along with his sword skills, Kuroi uses two shuriken referred to as Karasu, or \"The Crow.\" He first appears in ''Conquest'' part 1 and is later killed by Manji in ''Conquest'' part 3. Kuroi Sabato's is inspired by the band [[Black Sabbath]]; Kuroi Sabato roughly translates into [[Black Sabbath]] from Japanese. Kuroi is a direct translation to the color black. ''Sabato'' when romanized, can be taken as \"Sabbath.\" Black Sabbath is one of Hiroaki Samura's favorite bands.\n\n* {{nihongo|'''Araya Kawakami'''|\u5ddd\u4e0a \u65b0\u591c|Kawakami Araya}} {{anime voices|[[Daisuke Namikawa]] (2008 anime), Masato Obara (2019 anime)<ref name=\"2019-cast-3\">{{cite web|url=https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2019-09-13/blade-of-the-immortal-anime-reveals-9-more-cast-members/.151062|title=Blade of the Immortal Anime Reveals 9 More Cast Members|publisher=[[Anime News Network]]|date=2019-09-13|accessdate=2019-09-13}}</ref>|[[Liam O'Brien]]}}\n: An Itt\u014d-ry\u016b swordsman living as a mask-maker. Determined to conceal his past from his son, Renzo, he is also the man who led the rape of Rin's mother. He first appears in ''On Silent Wings'' part 1, and is later killed by Manji in ''On Silent Wings'' part 6. Renzo then attacks Manji in rage, Manji feigning death. Renzo then makes an assumption his father had a sordid past with Rin at his father's burial, when Rin says, hypothetically, that there are some reasons past incidents shouldn't be brought up, as the blissful ignorance is better than the lifetime of shame. He appears in ''On Silent Wings'' (I-VI).\n\n* {{nihongo|'''Eiku Shizuma'''|\u9591\u99ac \u6c38\u7a7a|Shizuma Eiku}} {{anime voices|[[Katsuyuki Konishi]] (2008 anime), [[Shunsuke Sakuya]] (2019 anime)<ref name=\"2019-cast-2\"/>m|James Hoover}}\n\n: Immortal swordsman usually dressed as a [[Komus\u014d|monk]] wearing a basket hat. Gifted with the same blood-worms as Manji, he seeks to gain Manji as an ally to overthrow Anotsu. He said in ''Cry of the Worm'' that the kessen-chu were given to him by Yaobikuni during the [[Muromachi]] period, which means he is two hundred years old. His weapons are a poisoned pair of a dagger and a saber both named Inoue Shinkai Kosatsu (\"Wormkiller\"). He first appears in ''Conquest'' part 1, is named in ''Cry of the Worm'' part 1 and is later killed by Manji in ''Cry of the Worm'' part 3. The poison he uses (Kessen Satsu) is later used in ''Trickster'' in an attempt to kill Manji.\n\n* {{nihongo|'''Higa'''|\u706b\u74e6|Higa}}: Itt\u014d-ry\u016b fighter fascinated by Manji's immortality and determined to somehow steal it from him.

Beheaded by Shinriji as Higa was attempting to kill Hyakurin. He appears in ''Comrades'' (I-VI).\n* {{nihongo|'''Hanada'''|\u82b1\u7530|Hanada}}: Cocky Itt\u014d-ry\u016b swordsman who detests the sun. Killed by Manji. He wields a pair of very narrow swords, one with a small hooked blade and the other with a straight small blade at the ends of the pommels, called Ench\u016b-maru (Swallows of Death), which Samura notes would not allow Hanada to kill anyone unless he precisely strikes a lethal point. Samura stated he originally was supposed to resemble [[John Lennon]] but he ended up as \"just another [[otaku]] dude\". His glasses have a similar shape to those of [[Spider Jerusalem]], one being round and the other quadratic. He appears in ''Comrades'' (I-IV).\n* {{nihongo|'''Uruma'''|\u5b87\u7559\u9593|Uruma}}:Composed Itt\u014d-ry\u016b swordsman whose trademark is a chain ending in a barded spike, used for immobilizing his enemy, as well as his large machete-like weapon, Ondeko-bachi (Devil's Drumstick).

He has a star burst shaped scar over his left eye as a result of fighting a bear in his youth, an event which also permeates into his fighting style.

He fights using a sword which is designed to soak poisons and a dagger used to make his killing stroke.

Her primary weapon is an odd knife which is fashioned from a spearhead. She appears in the later chapters as one of Itt\u014d-ry\u016b's new recruits and greatly admires Anotsu. Doa always travels with her friend Isaku and the two have developed complementary fighting styles. This usually consists of Doa providing the offense with her speed and dagger, while Isaku provides the defense with his armored arms. Her tendency to jump right into battle with little to no provocation often lands her and Isaku in trouble. She ends up befriending Asano Rin.  She and Isaku are both originally from Hokkaido, where Doa was adopted and raised by [[Ainu people|Ainu]], but was treated as an outsider by her contemporaries despite her devotion to the Ainu.  She previously went by the names \"Kuichiru\" and \"Towa\"; her current name, Yoshino, comes from a novel that Anotsu lent her so she would improve her literacy.\n\n* {{nihongo|'''Isaku Yasonokami'''|\u516b\u82d1\u72fc \u5937\u4f5c|Yason\u014dkami Isaku}}\n: An Itt\u014d-ry\u016b member of great height (over 1.90 meters/6'2\" tall) and strength. Unlike most members of the Itt\u014d-ry\u016b, Isaku has no weapons to speak of, instead he wears various piece of armor and tends to act defensively. He is also Doa's best friend and the two always travel together. Isaku often finds himself rescuing Doa, apologizing for her and keeping her from killing others (usually by picking her up and running away). He and Doa have also developed complementary fighting styles, with Isaku acting as the defense and Doa as the offense. He ends up befriending Asano Rin. In reality, he is a [[Portuguese people|Portuguese]] [[Christians|Christian]] and the son of a priest. He is not incredibly intelligent, but is kindhearted. Is cut in two as a result of the experiments in Habaki's compound, only to be reassembled by Doa - he briefly has similar regenerative abilities to Manji, which gradually wear off.\n\n* {{nihongo|'''Koji Kashin'''|\u679c\u5fc3\u5c45\u58eb|Kashin Koji}}\n: A spy and doctor for the Itt\u014d-ry\u016b, one of the ten core members of the group; he operates in Edo under the alias of {{nihongo|''Mizushina-sensei''|\u6c34\u79d1 \u5148\u751f}}.  He is an elderly man with a long white beard and unknown to Habaki, Kashin has been making highly detailed maps of his castle as he performs medical services in Habaki's stronghold.  These maps are later used to aid Rin and Doa as they infiltrate Habaki's castle to find and rescue Manji and Isaku. He is killed in battle by Ryo of Rokki-Dan.\n\n* {{nihongo|'''Ozuhan'''|\u6016\u7554}}\n: A masked member of the Itt\u014d-ry\u016b who appears to be deaf and communicates through the use of sign language and simple sounds.  He is one of the ten core members of the group.  He is known as \"the guy no one wants to fight beside\" because of his use of a hypnotic flute to fight. Ozuhan, himself, is immune to the effects of his instrument.  He is extremely agile and highly aware of his surroundings, allowing him to escape most traps; originally sent to Habaki's stronghold to aid Rin and Doa, he escapes from the same castle during Anotsu's raid and is separated from the group afterward.\n\n* {{nihongo|'''Sukezane Baro'''|\u99ac\u7d7d \u7950\u5b9f|Baro Sukezane}}\n: A powerful and skilled swordsman of the Itt\u014d-ry\u016b, he conducts espionage related activities and is one of the ten core members of the group.  He carries two katana that he wields effectively, but his trademark weapon is a third sword, a [[nodachi]] with holes along the entire blade that allow him to retain his remarkable speed.  Among his distinguishing features is a scar that runs across his nose, which results in Manji being mistaken for Sukezane during Habaki's final attempt to wipe out the Itt\u014d-ry\u016b. He sacrifices himself against shogunate guards so Anotsu and Magatsu can escape after their raid on Edo castle.\n\n==Mugai-ry\u016b==\n* {{nihongo|'''Kagimura Habaki'''|\u5410 \u9264\u7fa4|Habaki Kagimura}} {{anime voices|[[Takayuki Sugo]] (2008 anime), [[Jouji Nakata]] (2019 anime)<ref name=\"2019-cast-3\"/>|[[Kirk Thornton]]}}\n:The leader of the Shogun's Banshu samurai, the Bangashira, and his household included his wife Shima, son Sakutaro and daughter to a concubine, Ryo who dotes on him. He is secretly the leader of the Mugai-ry\u016b and later the Rokki-Dan and becomes the main antagonist of the story. He simultaneously invites the Itt\u014d-ry\u016b to become an official sword school while directing the Mugai-ry\u016b against it. Kagimura also masterminded and took part in the massacre that occurred during a feast welcoming the Itt\u014d-ry\u016b into the Banshu. Abayama's comments imply that he is incredibly skilled with a sword, which he proves by his attack on Manji in Trickster, volume 15, however, the battle costs him an eye and Manji escapes the secret prison in which he is held, resulting in Habaki's removal from office and orders for him to take his life.  However, he is given the opportunity to die with honour and is given one month, along with the control of the assassins of the Rokki-dan, to fully eradicate the Itto-ryu and its leader.  With nothing to lose, he ruthlessly pursues Anotsu before finally catching up to him, along with Manji, Rin, and Makie. He is blinded during his duel with Anotsu, which combined with Manji's untimely interference leads to a fatal error while anticipating Anotsu's final attack. He first appears in ''Dark Shadows'' part 1.\n\n* {{nihongo|'''Hyakurin'''|\u767e\u7433|Hyakurin}} {{anime voices|[[Megumi Toyoguchi]] (2008 anime), [[Marika Hayashi]] (2019 anime)<ref name=\"2019-cast-3\"/>|[[Karen Strassman]]}}\n: A female [[assassination|assassin]] and a [[lieutenant]] in the Mugai-ry\u016b. Hyakurin was the wife of an abusive samurai, Hayakawa Kak\u014dsai Genkei, who was obsessed with trying to gain fame by training Matsuhiko, their sickly son, to become a strong swordsman. He killed Matsuhiko's unnamed twin sister shortly after her birth because he saw no worth in raising a girl and then killed Matsuhiko foer failing to meet his expectations. She later kills her husband to avenge the death of her children and is then arrested and sentenced to death. Her case came to the attention of Kagimura who subsequently recruited her into Mugai-ry\u016b. Hyakurin's most unusual physical trait is her blonde hair (concealed frequently under a wig), which she maintains by bleaching it with a strong chemical as a compulsive desire to remove bloodstains from it. While her skills with a sword are unremarkable, she has an extensive knowledge of poisons. This knowledge carries over into her choice of weaponry, a collapsible wrist mounted crossbow with poisoned bolts named Burafuma (Little Steps). The crossbow also possesses two blades such that when the weapon is collapsed, Hyakurin can use it to stab her opponents. After volume 11, Beasts, her skills are impeded after being tortured and having her arm smashed. She later becomes pregnant and ends up \"retired\" from the Mugai-ry\u016b because of a deal between Habaki and Giichi when Giichi earns his freedom.  She has no desire to keep the child because she believes she will be reminded of Shinriji's death and the faces of the Itt\u014d-ry\u016b men who raped her.  She first appears in ''Dark Shadows'' part 1.\n\n* {{nihongo|'''Shira'''|\u5c38\u826f|Shira}} {{anime voices|[[Shin-ichiro Miki]] (2008 anime), [[T\u014dru Nara]] (2019 anime)<ref name=\"2019-cast-3\"/>|Jason Wishnov}}\n: A cold-blooded killer in the Mugai-ry\u016b. He's responsible for the death of Magatsu Taito's close friend, O-Ren. Shira's a sadistic psychopath who derives sexual pleasure in the torture and murder of his victims, particularly young women. After an attempt to ambush Anotsu goes horribly wrong and he tries to take it out on his attackers. He uses the saw-blade side of his sword to hack of some of their limbs, and then tries to rape a prostitute that was with them while cutting her up at the same time. Rin tries to stop him but is slapped away, Manji arrives and manages to take off Shira's hand before he runs off. Following this incident he cuts some flesh from his injured arm, and sharpens the bones into spikes. His hair turns stark white due to the trauma he caused himself. He develops an obsession with revenge on Manji which leads to him betraying his Mugai-ry\u016b comrades, causing the death of Shinriji and capture of Hyakurin. Later, his quest for revenge against Manji leads to a battle with Magatsu Taito, who was traveling with Manji specifically so he could find Shira. This battle further cripples him with the loss of his remaining hand. Recently he's been shown to be imprisoned in the same prison Manji is currently being held in, and has been set parameters/lists as to whom he shall face before being allowed to fight Manji (this list includes Magatsu). He also states that he has since lost one eye, and has a new \"weapon\" of sorts. No longer being able to feel pain, he steals Manji's missing left arm and attaches to his own, gaining bloodworms.  He is eventually killed by Manji after an intense battle due to overextending his immortality by getting cut up too much while his bloodworms were weakened by the winter cold and his body is left to be eaten by dogs. However, before he finally succumbs to the pack of dogs, he tells Renzo not to become pure evil like himself, not to listen to men like him anymore and to give up his pursuit of Manji's death; saying that Renzo isn't cut out for a life of vengeance. He uses a ninja-to sword, with a saw edge on one side of the blade. He usually uses the regular side to immobilize opponents by cutting off their legs, and then uses the saw-blade to cut off other parts of the body and cause maximum pain. This sword is named \"Hotosogi\" or woman shadow eraser. However, there is a second meaning for \"Hotosogi\" which also fits Shira's sadistic nature; when the kanji for woman and shadow are used together they become vagina. He first appears in ''Dark Shadows'' part 2 and is first named in ''Dark Shadows'' part 3.\n\n* {{nihongo|'''Giichi'''|\u507d\u4e00|Giichi<!--It's Gi-ichi but written as \"Giichi\"-->}} {{anime voices|[[Toshiyuki Morikawa]] (2008 anime), Hiroshi Shirokuma (2019 anime)<ref name=\"2019-cast-3\"/>|[[David Vincent (actor)|David Vincent]]}}\n: The strongest Mugai-ry\u016b killer, aside from the immortality enhanced Shira. Though little is initially known about his past or reasons for being sentenced to death, it is eventually revealed that after Giichi's wife died, he devoted himself to raising their sickly son, Tojiro.  However, as a poor shipwright, the cost of doctors, medicine, and interest forced Giichi to resort to crime until he was caught and recruited by Habaki.  Giichi is one of the most skilled fighters in the series, having killed a total of 59 Itt\u014d-ry\u016b swordsmen on his own. Of the Mugai-ry\u016b, he is the only member who manages to garner enough kills to earn his freedom; however, this achievement means little to him when he learns at the same time that Tojiro has suddenly died. He works closely with Kagimura Habaki and cares for the other Mugai-ry\u016b, attempting to buy Hyakurin's freedom as well, unsuccessfully.  He disappears when Habaki dissolves the Mugai-ry\u016b and is later found living in among the [[burakumin]] by Rin and Hyakurin, where he provides Rin with information concerning Manji's whereabouts.  Now a broken man, he deliberately distances himself from Hyakurin to keep her from suffering any more pain and is aware of her pregnancy - when she tries to kill her baby, he stops her and persuades her to carry the child to term and allow him to raise the baby after it is born. He eventually agrees to work briefly for Habaki once again against the Itto-ryu; he and Hyakurin attack Abayama Sosuke, with Giichi taking on Abayama himself in a bloody battle that ends with Giichi defeating Abayama at the cost of an ear. He uses a unique weapon which resembles an oversized bladed handcuff attached to a length of chain. The weapon, Kanetsura's Mito-no-Kami (Guardian of the Three Paths), was adapted from a thresher or similar farming implement, and allows him to sever or entangle limbs, necks and weapons from a distance. It is hard to block as the handcuff like action will wrap it around what it hits, but it is broken by Manji in Volume 14: Last Blood. Manji gave Giichi one of his own weapons, two curved blades attached by a chain, that Giichi now uses though he claims he is only borrowing it. Giichi's first appearance is in ''Dark Shadows'' part 1.\n\n* {{nihongo|'''Shinriji'''|\u771f\u7406\u8def|Shinriji}} {{anime voices|[[Y\u016bya Uchida (voice actor)|Yuya Uchida]] (2008 anime), Chikahiro Kobayashi (2019 anime)<ref name=\"2019-cast-3\"/>|[[Kirk Thornton]]}}\n: A bumbling Mugai-ry\u016b swordsman. He was apparently a pickpocket and thief prior to joining the Mugai-ry\u016b. After attending a sword school, he worked for a silk merchant. Disgruntled by his low wages, he stole money from the merchant and left. Shinriji intentionally stole 1 ryo less than 10 ryo to avoid the death penalty. Unfortunately for him, they added the money he earned legitimately to the total. He worked most closely with Hyakurin and developed a crush on her, viewing her as a surrogate mother, her blonde hair reminding him of his foreign mother. While he's not highly skilled with a sword, he does have a firm grasp of dimensions as noted by Kinuka, and is implied by Kagimura to have much potential. He first appears in ''Dark Shadows'' part 1, and is later killed by Kinuka, but not before taking out four Itt\u014d-ry\u016b.  As he dies, he positions himself to point south-east (archaically called ''tatsumi'') in order to tell Giichi that Hyakurin has been taken to the ''Tatsumi'' district of Edo.  As a sign of respect, Hyakurin cuts her hair and places the tied locks on his gravesite.\n\n* {{nihongo|'''Makoto'''|\u771f\u7434|Makoto}} {{anime voices|[[Wataru Hatano]]|Jason Wishnov}}\n: A former male prostitute, Makoto was recruited to be the group's mole within the Itt\u014d-ry\u016b. During his time in the Itt\u014d-ry\u016b, he served as a page for the senior members often carrying letters and taking care of their weapons during meetings. He was a key player in the massacre which occurred during a feast meant to celebrate the official union of Itt\u014d-ry\u016b with Banshu, slipping poison into the Itt\u014d-ry\u016b's food. Makoto is later killed by Abayama.

After Mouzen's failure, Burando is assigned by Habaki to succeed at achieving immortality; though he does not do so within the time limit, Habaki allows Burando to continue since Burando has produced results. He zealously conducts experiments on Manji and other prisoners to replicate Manji's immortality with utmost understanding of the human anatomy. However, his obsession results in the brutal deaths of a large number of prisoners and he is driven mad by his obsession. After Rin rescues Manji, Burando escapes from the prison and repents as he slowly finds the families of the men he killed and hopes to aid them anonymously with his medical knowledge.\n*{{nihongo|'''Mouzen'''|\u5b5f\u81b3}}: An experienced doctor brought in alongside Burando Ayame by Habaki to conduct experiments on Manji to achieve immortality.

She works as a woodcutter and is earnestly devoted to her father. Habaki's family appears to be unaware of her, while Ryo cares deeply for both Sakutaro and Shima, Habaki's son and wife respectively. Though Habaki arranges for her to become a ward of one of his allies, Ryo would rather die helping him by taking the vacant seat among the member of the Rokki-dan's Onihana division.  However, despite her regular training, her skills as a sword fighter are mediocre in comparison to the considerably more powerful combatants existing in the series, a fact she is aware of. After returning as the only survivor of a mission in which she kills Koji Kashin, Habaki releases her from the Rokki-dan. Desperate to follow her father, Magatsu finds her feverish and collapsed on the ground and reluctantly takes her with him as he attempts to catch up to Anotsu, during which Ryo makes the request for Magatsu to take her as a pupil. She later dies protecting her father from Hanabusa's gunners.\n*{{nihongo|'''Inroku Ban'''|\u4f34 \u6bb7\u516d|''Ban Inroku''}}: A member of the Rokki-dan's Onihana division.

Fighting with large wide blades that can crush as well as cut, and possessing a heavily armored body that limits his opponent's avenues of attack, he proves to be a formidable opponent and manages to sever Manji's body in half during their fight. Rin takes advantage of Arashino's pity and duplicituously makes it appear that Manji's body isn't recovering from damage and then sets Arashino's body on fire, allowing Manji gain the advantage to kill him.\n*{{nihongo|'''Shinhei Doma'''|\u5f29\u99ac \u5fc3\u5175}}: A member of the Rokki-dan's Onihana division, he uses a nunchaku-like weapon.

She is also a student of Master Sori, whom she is infatuated with, and becomes friends with Rin, who works as Sori's housekeeper. Her attempts to have him accept her affections are usually misconstrued and her artistic style and poor cooking ability do little to impress Sori, who appears to be oblivious.

She appears to be capable of taking care of her family's house, since Magatsu, who was hired by Sori to protect Tatsu, leaves with Manji in search of Shira even though Sori is still off painting. By the time Rin and Manji return, Tatsu has apparently married a local merchant's son, while Rin winds up helping Sori out with household tasks.

When Ryo attempts to save them, Shima astutely realizes that Ryo is Habaki's illegitimate daughter. To atone for her husband's perceived failure, Shima deliberately kills both their son and herself before Hanabusa and Habaki to ensure that Habaki will no longer have any obstacles to destroy the Itto-ryu.

Though Hanabusa is cunning, his ability to scheme his way into ensuring Habaki's downfall by negotiating with the Itto-ryu fails largely due to Hanabusa's inability to match Habaki's ruthless determination and being unable to truly anticipate the movements of Anotsu and the Itto-ryu.\n\n==References==\n<references/>\n\n{{Blade of the Immortal}}\n\n[[Category:Lists of anime and manga characters|Blade of the Immortal]]\n", "text_old": "{{DISPLAYTITLE:List of ''Blade of the Immortal'' characters}}\nThis is a list of characters from the manga series ''[[Blade of the Immortal]]''.\n\n==Main characters==\n* {{nihongo|'''Manji'''|\u534d|Manji}} {{anime voices|[[Tomokazu Seki]] (2008 anime), [[Kenjiro Tsuda]] (2019 anime)<ref name=\"2019-cast\">{{cite web|url=https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2019-08-08/new-blade-of-the-immortal-anime-promo-video-reveals-cast-staff-october-premiere-amazon-only-streaming/.149843|title=New Blade of the Immortal Anime's Promo Video Reveals Cast, Staff, October Premiere, Amazon-only Streaming|publisher=[[Anime News Network]]|date=2019-08-08|accessdate=2019-08-08}}</ref>|[[Keith Silverstein]]}}\n\n:The immortal referred to in the title. While not lazy, he is very laid-back, often seen sleeping. Manji also has a strange sense of \"honour\" that is in many ways similar to the fighting-ethic of the Itto-Ryu. The fallen [[samurai]] Manji served the ''[[Hatamoto]]'' Horii Shigenobu, a local [[daimy\u014d]], enforcing his brutal rule (unknowingly) on the local populace until he found out his lord was corrupt and killed him. For that he was considered an outlaw and hunted down by the same daimy\u014d clan, achieving the nickname \"''Killer of 100''\" after the body count. He planned to flee to his sister's house even though she had married an officer of the law, Sait\u014d Tatsumasa. Manji ended up killing his sister's husband out of self-defense when he attacked Manji. His sister witnessed her husband's death at the hands of her brother and went insane, reverting to a child-like mindset. Manji settled down to take care of her. At some point during this time, he met Yaobikuni (her name literally means \"nun of eight hundred years\"), a mysterious [[nun]], who gave him the kessen-chu, or sacred bloodworms that made him immortal. Despite the obvious advantages of being nearly invincible, Manji dislikes being immortal. He tries to get Yaobikuni to remove the kessen-chu, finally making a deal with her. He has to kill 1000 bad men, to make up for the 100 good men he killed, if he does this, Yaobikuni will rid him of his immortality. It's worth noting, one reason he doesn't like being immortal is he feels it is making his swordsmanship rusty, because he doesn't have to be as good to win. After his sister is killed (due to a revenge for his actions) he met Rin, whom he accepted to help since he felt she was very much alike to his deceased sister. Manji is constantly trying to make amends for his past actions: he kills his lord to atone for those he killed on the Damiyo's orders; looked after his sister to atone for the deaths of the one hundred cops he killed; and makes the deal to kill one thousand bad men and to look after Rin to make amends for the death of his sister; he takes his role as her protector/surrogate older-brother seriously. However each time Manji tries to do something \"good\", he tends to only make the situation worse (the death of his lord leading to the deaths of one hundred cops, for example).\n\n:He uses many weapons, a good number of which came from defeated opponents. His two short, hooked swords are named Shid\u014d (four paths). His two standard swords are named Imo-no-Kami Tatsumasa (Sister Defender Tatsumasa). His two chained scythes are called Mumei (nameless). His double bladed sword-breaker is named Kotengu (Little devil).  Most of his weapons are hidden under his shirt, a seemingly impossible feat given their large number, irregular shapes and lack of sheaths.  One of Manji's signature tricks is to make any of his hidden weapons drop out of his sleeves into one or both of his waiting hands whenever they are needed.\n\n:He first appears in ''Criminal''.\n\n* {{nihongo|'''Rin Asano'''|\u6d45\u91ce \u51db|Asano Rin}} {{anime voices|[[Rina Sat\u014d]] (2008 anime), [[Ayane Sakura]] (2019 anime)<ref name=\"2019-cast\"/>|[[Mela Lee]]}}\n\n:The sole survivor of an Itt\u014d-ry\u016b massacre at Anotsu's hand and heir to her father's sword school, the \"Mutenichi-ry\u016b\". She has mediocre swordsmanship skills but an intense desire to avenge the brutal death of her family. At the beginning of the series she is portrayed as somebody who is trying to act mature, but is still very childish - as the series progresses she steadily \"grows up\" and loses much of her naivety. She hires Manji as her bodyguard in this quest. However, it's not as simple as that - Rin is constantly torn by doubt over the righteousness and validity of her mission and fears becoming a hypocrite as Anotsu claims that she is more like the Itt\u014d-ry\u016b, especially when he remarks she chooses to use throwing knives instead of a sword like the \"Mutenichi-ry\u016b\" teaches. She meets Anotsu at one point, but he claims that she is more like the Itt\u014d-ry\u016b as she continues her path for revenge. Anotsu's words is causing her to doubt.  When she finally encounters Anotsu in Kaga, she realizes she cannot defeat him and winds up traveling with him. If he starts to trust her, she might get the chance she wants to kill him. But Anotsu is no fool and is fully aware of what she is doing, despite this he allows her presence. She has since left his company, vowing that she will eventually kill him; yet she will stand back for the time being and watch how the events unfold. It is also worth noting that she kisses a sleeping Manji in the fourteenth volume, Last Blood, and has shown on numerous occasions that she develops feelings towards him.  They are as of now largely unreciprocated. She has three weapons, a Chinese sword named Kutoneshirika which she carries in a Toju (purse-like scabbard of sorts), a [[Tant\u014d]] type dagger and a set of small throwing daggers named Ogunchu (Golden Wasps). Even though she is only mediocre in terms of fighting ability, Rin is still more skilled with weapons than most women of that time period and the fact that she carries a small arsenal of weapons with her makes her somewhat unique.  She first appears in ''Conquest'' part 1.\n\n==Itt\u014d-ry\u016b==\n* {{nihongo|'''Kagehisa Anotsu'''|\u5929\u6d25 \u5f71\u4e45|Anotsu Kagehisa}} {{anime voices|[[Hirofumi Nojima]] (2008 anime), [[Nozomu Sasaki]] (2019 anime)<ref name=\"2019-cast-2\">{{cite web|url=https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2019-08-24/new-blade-of-the-immortal-anime-reveals-6-new-cast-members/.150348|title=New Blade of the Immortal Anime Reveals 6 New Cast Members|publisher=[[Anime News Network]]|date=2019-08-24|accessdate=2019-08-24}}</ref>|[[Ezra Weisz]]}}\n\n: Leader of the Itt\u014d-ry\u016b and equal of Manji. While painted as the \"villain\" of the series at the start, he has had many scenes devoted to making the reader sympathetic to his views and goals.  An emotionally cold young man has prodigious skill with the sword, and leads the Itt\u014d-ry\u016b in order to form a d\u014dj\u014d dedicated not to form and rules, but to the simple test of superior lethality. Brought up by an abusive grandfather (a swordsman disgraced by the Asano d\u014dj\u014d), Anotsu is as pragmatic and shrewd as he is deadly. He isn't as inhuman as originally believed, as he even allows Rin to live after she attacks him; even letting her follow him everywhere. He is currently at \"war\" with Habaki Kagimura, the leader of the Banshu. Alongside Manji and Makie Otono-Tachibana, Anotsu confronts Habaki Kagimura and his Rokki-Dan in Nakaminato. He eventually slays Habaki in a tightly-contested duel, but is too exhausted to mount a challenge in the subsequent duel with Manji. Manji spares his life but Anotsu is fatally stabbed by Rin during his escape, although it's later hinted that he may have survived the attack. He has two weapons. The first, his main weapon, is a Nepalese-based axe named Kabutsuchi (Head Hammer). The other is his rarely used sword of the same name. First appears in ''Conquest'' part 1.\n\n* {{nihongo|'''Taito Magatsu'''|\u51f6 \u6234\u6597|Magatsu Taito}} {{anime voices|[[Kazuya Nakai]] (2008 anime), [[Tatsuhisa Suzuki]] (2019 anime)<ref name=\"2019-cast-2\"/>|[[Derek Stephen Prince]]}}\n\n: Among the Itt\u014d-ry\u016b's finest swordsmen. Of peasant origin, he became a swordsman to avenge his sister, who was killed as a child by a samurai. Taito is one of the few swordsmen who has fought Manji and survived. He has also fought by Manji's side as well. He can be considered a kenshi, a swordsman who is not from the [[samurai]] class.  He despises the government by extension to his hatred of samurai and quits the Itto-ryu when Anotsu allies the group with Kagimura and the shogunate, though he remains on friendly terms with Anotsu.  When his lover of sorts, a prostitute named O-Ren, is killed by Shira, Magatsu ends up following Manji around due to the fact that he knows Shira is after Manji. Although they argue a lot, Manji and Taito have a relatively friendly relationship. In the end Manji allows Taito to find Shira, and despite how much Shira wants to kill Manji, he lets Taito get him. Eventually Shira loses the one hand he had left to Taito and presumably falls to his death.  Concerned by something Shira said, Taito decides to meet up with Anotsu and he eventually rejoins the Itt\u014d-ry\u016b.  Magatsu later joins Manji and Meguro to finally finish off Shira.  Taito's weapon is a gladius-like triple-sectioned sword named Grand Turk. The main blade is a gladius, the second is a smaller, shorter sword hidden in the handle, the last is a spear-head like dagger hidden within the pommel of the second blade. The sword is curiously missing a sword guard. First appears in ''Conquest'' part 1, first named in ''Fanatic'' part 1.\n\n* {{nihongo|'''Makie Otono-Tachibana'''|\u4e59\u6a58 \u69c7\u7d75|Otono-Tachibana Makie}} {{anime voices|[[Mamiko Noto]] (2008 anime), [[Houko Kuwashima]] (2019 anime)<ref name=\"2019-cast-2\"/>|[[Laura Bailey (voice actress)|Laura Bailey]]}}\n\n: Master swordswoman and in love with Anotsu.  Possibly the most skilled swordsfighter in the manga, she is said to be Anotsu's match and saved his life with her deadly abilities when they were children. Born into a samurai family, Makie and her mother {{nihongo|Fuki|\u4e59\u6a58\u5439|''Otono-Tachibana Fuki''}} were disowned and cast away from the family by her father, {{nihongo|Harukawa|\u6625\u5ddd\u7fa9\u660e|''Harukawa Yoshiaki''}}, when Makie's older brother committed [[seppuku]] after Makie was revealed to have inherited the family's famed talent and he was unable to defeat her in combat. She initially choose the path of the sword to avenge her mother's disgrace. She ended up becoming a [[geisha]] after Anotsu bought her freedom because she neither had the nerve to become a prostitute, like her mother, nor commit to becoming a swordfighter, lacking the nerve to kill when her concentration in battle is broken.  She defeats, but does not kill Manji, apparently turning her back on Anotsu. Later found living alone, having bound her hand in an attempt to destroy her own skill in combat after her father's humiliating death. She reappears in Last Blood, having followed Anotsu since he left Shirakawa when she realized his body was weakening, and destroys the nearly all men under Iriya who were pursuing Anotsu. After Iriya's death, she leaves with Anotsu and Magatsu.  She is later stricken with the same lung sickness her father died from while quietly residing with Anotsu and acting as his bodyguard.  When he departs from Edo during Habaki's last effort to destroy the Itto-ryu, Anotsu leaves her behind in order to spare her from fighting again.  However, she pursues him in spite of how her sickness is advancing until she encounters Habaki and the Rokki-dan, where upon she is reunited with Anotsu and Manji and fights alongside them.  As said by Anotsu, she is the only one that can beat him other than Manji, and even Habaki immediately recognizes and fears her skill. Makie is fatally wounded during an ambush by Hanabusa's forces, but manages to kill them all before dying. Her weapon, a double bladed three-section-staff, is named Haru-no-Okina (Old Man of Spring). She conceals her weapon in a hollowed-out [[shamisen]], a mandolin-like instrument. She first appears in ''Dreamsong'' Part 1.\n\n===Other Itt\u014d-ry\u016b===\n* {{nihongo|'''S\u014dsuke Abayama'''|\u963f\u8449\u5c71 \u5b97\u4ecb|Abayama S\u014dsuke}} {{anime voices|[[Shinya Fukumatsu]] (2019 anime)<ref name=\"2019-cast-2\"/>}}\n: Second-in-command of the Itt\u014d-ry\u016b. An aged swordsman who nevertheless remains one of the Itt\u014d-ry\u016b's most skilled fighters. A skilled political operative, well suited to handling the d\u014dj\u014d's administrative tasks. He is missing his right arm, and uses a concealed dagger/machete-like weapon with a strange hilt. His missing right arm is actually replaced by three chains with weights which he uses as a weapon against Giichi. He is critically injured by Giichi after an intense battle during the Rokki-Dan pursuit. In the final chapters of the manga, Giichi stumbles upon Abayama, in a decrepit state, being treated by his granddaughter, making him one of the few survivors of the Itt\u014d-ry\u016b.\n\n* {{nihongo|'''Sabato Kuroi'''|\u9ed2\u8863 \u9bd6\u4eba|Kuroi Sabato}} {{anime voices|[[Masashi Ebara]] (2008 anime), Eiji Hanawa (2019 anime)<ref name=\"2019-cast-2\"/>|Artt Butler}}\n\n: Skilled pupil of Anotsu Sabur\u014d (Anotsu Kagehisa's grandfather) and master Itt\u014d-ry\u016b swordsman. Along with his skills with a sword, Kuroi has several quirks, which includes poetry referencing [[Black Sabbath]] appearing whenever he does. In addition, Kuroi is so obsessed with ageless beauty that he used taxidermy to preserve the heads of his former wife and Rin's mother, and mounted them on his shoulders. Along with his sword skills, Kuroi uses two shuriken referred to as Karasu, or \"The Crow.\" He first appears in ''Conquest'' part 1 and is later killed by Manji in ''Conquest'' part 3. Kuroi Sabato's is inspired by the band [[Black Sabbath]]; Kuroi Sabato roughly translates into [[Black Sabbath]] from Japanese. Kuroi is a direct translation to the color black.

He first appears in ''On Silent Wings'' part 1, and is later killed by Manji in ''On Silent Wings'' part 6. Renzo then attacks Manji in rage, Manji feigning death. Renzo then makes an assumption his father had a sordid past with Rin at his father's burial, when Rin says, hypothetically, that there are some reasons past incidents shouldn't be brought up, as the blissful ignorance is better than the lifetime of shame.

Doa always travels with her friend Isaku and the two have developed complementary fighting styles. This usually consists of Doa providing the offense with her speed and dagger, while Isaku provides the defense with his armored arms. Her tendency to jump right into battle with little to no provocation often lands her and Isaku in trouble. She ends up befriending Asano Rin.  She and Isaku are both originally from Hokkaido, where Doa was adopted and raised by [[Ainu people|Ainu]], but was treated as an outsider by her contemporaries despite her devotion to the Ainu.

He carries two katana that he wields effectively, but his trademark weapon is a third sword, a [[nodachi]] with holes along the entire blade that allow him to retain his remarkable speed.  Among his distinguishing features is a scar that runs across his nose, which results in Manji being mistaken for Sukezane during Habaki's final attempt to wipe out the Itt\u014d-ry\u016b.

He simultaneously invites the Itt\u014d-ry\u016b to become an official sword school while directing the Mugai-ry\u016b against it. Kagimura also masterminded and took part in the massacre that occurred during a feast welcoming the Itt\u014d-ry\u016b into the Banshu. Abayama's comments imply that he is incredibly skilled with a sword, which he proves by his attack on Manji in Trickster, volume 15, however, the battle costs him an eye and Manji escapes the secret prison in which he is held, resulting in Habaki's removal from office and orders for him to take his life.  However, he is given the opportunity to die with honour and is given one month, along with the control of the assassins of the Rokki-dan, to fully eradicate the Itto-ryu and its leader.  With nothing to lose, he ruthlessly pursues Anotsu before finally catching up to him, along with Manji, Rin, and Makie.

He killed Matsuhiko's unnamed twin sister shortly after her birth because he saw no worth in raising a girl and then killed Matsuhiko foer failing to meet his expectations. She later kills her husband to avenge the death of her children and is then arrested and sentenced to death. Her case came to the attention of Kagimura who subsequently recruited her into Mugai-ry\u016b. Hyakurin's most unusual physical trait is her blonde hair (concealed frequently under a wig), which she maintains by bleaching it with a strong chemical as a compulsive desire to remove bloodstains from it. While her skills with a sword are unremarkable, she has an extensive knowledge of poisons. This knowledge carries over into her choice of weaponry, a collapsible wrist mounted crossbow with poisoned bolts named Burafuma (Little Steps). The crossbow also possesses two blades such that when the weapon is collapsed, Hyakurin can use it to stab her opponents. After volume 11, Beasts, her skills are impeded after being tortured and having her arm smashed. She later becomes pregnant and ends up \"retired\" from the Mugai-ry\u016b because of a deal between Habaki and Giichi when Giichi earns his freedom.  She has no desire to keep the child because she believes she will be reminded of Shinriji's death and the faces of the Itt\u014d-ry\u016b men who raped her.  She first appears in ''Dark Shadows'' part 1.\n\n* {{nihongo|'''Shira'''|\u5c38\u826f|Shira}} {{anime voices|[[Shin-ichiro Miki]] (2008 anime), [[T\u014dru Nara]] (2019 anime)<ref name=\"2019-cast-3\"/>|Jason Wishnov}}\n: A cold-blooded killer in the Mugai-ry\u016b. He's responsible for the death of Magatsu Taito's close friend, O-Ren. Shira's a sadistic psychopath who derives sexual pleasure in the torture and murder of his victims, particularly young women. After an attempt to ambush Anotsu goes horribly wrong and he tries to take it out on his attackers. He uses the saw-blade side of his sword to hack of some of their limbs, and then tries to rape a prostitute that was with them while cutting her up at the same time. Rin tries to stop him but is slapped away, Manji arrives and manages to take off Shira's hand before he runs off. Following this incident he cuts some flesh from his injured arm, and sharpens the bones into spikes. His hair turns stark white due to the trauma he caused himself. He develops an obsession with revenge on Manji which leads to him betraying his Mugai-ry\u016b comrades, causing the death of Shinriji and capture of Hyakurin. Later, his quest for revenge against Manji leads to a battle with Magatsu Taito, who was traveling with Manji specifically so he could find Shira. This battle further cripples him with the loss of his remaining hand. Recently he's been shown to be imprisoned in the same prison Manji is currently being held in, and has been set parameters/lists as to whom he shall face before being allowed to fight Manji (this list includes Magatsu). He also states that he has since lost one eye, and has a new \"weapon\" of sorts. No longer being able to feel pain, he steals Manji's missing left arm and attaches to his own, gaining bloodworms.  He is eventually killed by Manji after an intense battle due to overextending his immortality by getting cut up too much while his bloodworms were weakened by the winter cold and his body is left to be eaten by dogs. However, before he finally succumbs to the pack of dogs, he tells Renzo not to become pure evil like himself, not to listen to men like him anymore and to give up his pursuit of Manji's death; saying that Renzo isn't cut out for a life of vengeance. He uses a ninja-to sword, with a saw edge on one side of the blade. He usually uses the regular side to immobilize opponents by cutting off their legs, and then uses the saw-blade to cut off other parts of the body and cause maximum pain. This sword is named \"Hotosogi\" or woman shadow eraser. However, there is a second meaning for \"Hotosogi\" which also fits Shira's sadistic nature; when the kanji for woman and shadow are used together they become vagina. He first appears in ''Dark Shadows'' part 2 and is first named in ''Dark Shadows'' part 3.\n\n* {{nihongo|'''Giichi'''|\u507d\u4e00|Giichi<!--It's Gi-ichi but written as \"Giichi\"-->}} {{anime voices|[[Toshiyuki Morikawa]] (2008 anime), Hiroshi Shirokuma (2019 anime)<ref name=\"2019-cast-3\"/>|[[David Vincent (actor)|David Vincent]]}}\n: The strongest Mugai-ry\u016b killer, aside from the immortality enhanced Shira. Though little is initially known about his past or reasons for being sentenced to death, it is eventually revealed that after Giichi's wife died, he devoted himself to raising their sickly son, Tojiro.  However, as a poor shipwright, the cost of doctors, medicine, and interest forced Giichi to resort to crime until he was caught and recruited by Habaki.  Giichi is one of the most skilled fighters in the series, having killed a total of 59 Itt\u014d-ry\u016b swordsmen on his own. Of the Mugai-ry\u016b, he is the only member who manages to garner enough kills to earn his freedom; however, this achievement means little to him when he learns at the same time that Tojiro has suddenly died. He works closely with Kagimura Habaki and cares for the other Mugai-ry\u016b, attempting to buy Hyakurin's freedom as well, unsuccessfully.  He disappears when Habaki dissolves the Mugai-ry\u016b and is later found living in among the [[burakumin]] by Rin and Hyakurin, where he provides Rin with information concerning Manji's whereabouts.  Now a broken man, he deliberately distances himself from Hyakurin to keep her from suffering any more pain and is aware of her pregnancy - when she tries to kill her baby, he stops her and persuades her to carry the child to term and allow him to raise the baby after it is born. He eventually agrees to work briefly for Habaki once again against the Itto-ryu; he and Hyakurin attack Abayama Sosuke, with Giichi taking on Abayama himself in a bloody battle that ends with Giichi defeating Abayama at the cost of an ear. He uses a unique weapon which resembles an oversized bladed handcuff attached to a length of chain. The weapon, Kanetsura's Mito-no-Kami (Guardian of the Three Paths), was adapted from a thresher or similar farming implement, and allows him to sever or entangle limbs, necks and weapons from a distance. It is hard to block as the handcuff like action will wrap it around what it hits, but it is broken by Manji in Volume 14: Last Blood. Manji gave Giichi one of his own weapons, two curved blades attached by a chain, that Giichi now uses though he claims he is only borrowing it. Giichi's first appearance is in ''Dark Shadows'' part 1.\n\n* {{nihongo|'''Shinriji'''|\u771f\u7406\u8def|Shinriji}} {{anime voices|[[Y\u016bya Uchida (voice actor)|Yuya Uchida]] (2008 anime), Chikahiro Kobayashi (2019 anime)<ref name=\"2019-cast-3\"/>|[[Kirk Thornton]]}}\n: A bumbling Mugai-ry\u016b swordsman. He was apparently a pickpocket and thief prior to joining the Mugai-ry\u016b. After attending a sword school, he worked for a silk merchant. Disgruntled by his low wages, he stole money from the merchant and left. Shinriji intentionally stole 1 ryo less than 10 ryo to avoid the death penalty. Unfortunately for him, they added the money he earned legitimately to the total. He worked most closely with Hyakurin and developed a crush on her, viewing her as a surrogate mother, her blonde hair reminding him of his foreign mother. While he's not highly skilled with a sword, he does have a firm grasp of dimensions as noted by Kinuka, and is implied by Kagimura to have much potential. He first appears in ''Dark Shadows'' part 1, and is later killed by Kinuka, but not before taking out four Itt\u014d-ry\u016b.  As he dies, he positions himself to point south-east (archaically called ''tatsumi'') in order to tell Giichi that Hyakurin has been taken to the ''Tatsumi'' district of Edo.  As a sign of respect, Hyakurin cuts her hair and places the tied locks on his gravesite.\n\n* {{nihongo|'''Makoto'''|\u771f\u7434|Makoto}} {{anime voices|[[Wataru Hatano]]|Jason Wishnov}}\n: A former male prostitute, Makoto was recruited to be the group's mole within the Itt\u014d-ry\u016b. During his time in the Itt\u014d-ry\u016b, he served as a page for the senior members often carrying letters and taking care of their weapons during meetings. He was a key player in the massacre which occurred during a feast meant to celebrate the official union of Itt\u014d-ry\u016b with Banshu, slipping poison into the Itt\u014d-ry\u016b's food. Makoto is later killed by Abayama.  He first appears in ''Dark Shadows'' part 1 and is later killed by Abayama in ''Pity''.\n\n==Shingyoto-ry\u016b==\n* {{nihongo|'''Kensui Ibane'''|\u4f0a\u7fbd \u7814\u6c34|Ibane Kensui}} Played by: [[Tsutomu Yamazaki]]\n:The [[Sensei]] of the Shingyoto-ry\u016b d\u014dj\u014d in [[Kaga Province|Kaga]].

Dead by her own hand.\n* {{nihongo|'''Iriya'''|\u5165\u8c37|Ir\u012ba}}:  Student of Ibane Kensui and unrequited lover of Ibane Hisoka.

Killed presumably by Magatsu.\n\n==Immortality Experiment Officials==\n*{{nihongo|'''Burando Ayame'''|\u7dbe\u76ee \u6b69\u862d\u4eba|Ayame Burado}}: After defying the edict of leaving Japan for seven years to learn about western medicine, Burando returned and was imprisoned by the Shogunate. After Mouzen's failure, Burando is assigned by Habaki to succeed at achieving immortality; though he does not do so within the time limit, Habaki allows Burando to continue since Burando has produced results. He zealously conducts experiments on Manji and other prisoners to replicate Manji's immortality with utmost understanding of the human anatomy. However, his obsession results in the brutal deaths of a large number of prisoners and he is driven mad by his obsession. After Rin rescues Manji, Burando escapes from the prison and repents as he slowly finds the families of the men he killed and hopes to aid them anonymously with his medical knowledge.\n*{{nihongo|'''Mouzen'''|\u5b5f\u81b3}}: An experienced doctor brought in alongside Burando Ayame by Habaki to conduct experiments on Manji to achieve immortality.

When Rin breaks into the prison to save Manji, she and Doa are confronted by Asaemon in Manji's cell; Asaemon, in turn, is killed by Manji.  His liver is later used by Manji as medicine for Makie's tuberculosis, despite her aversion to idea of consuming human liver.\n\n==Rokki-dan==\n{{nihongo|Rokki-dan|\u516d\u9b3c\u56e3|Six Demon Group}} are a private army divided into six divisions and fall under Habaki Kagimura's direct command. They are the successors to the Mugai-ryu and also consist of criminals.  Should they fail to destroy the Itto-ryu before Habaki's execution, they will be executed as well.\n\n*{{nihongo|'''Haiyabou'''|\u4f69\u77e2\u574a|''Haiyab\u014d''}}: A member of the Rokki-dan's Onihana division, armed with a halberd.

She works as a woodcutter and is earnestly devoted to her father.  Habaki's family appears to be unaware of her, while Ryo cares deeply for both Sakutaro and Shima, Habaki's son and wife respectively.  Though Habaki arranges for her to become a ward of one of his allies, Ryo would rather die helping him by taking the vacant seat among the member of the Rokki-dan's Onihana division.  However, despite her regular training, her skills as a sword fighter are mediocre in comparison to the considerably more powerful combatants existing in the series, a fact she is aware of.  After returning as the only survivor of a mission in which she kills Koji Kashin, Habaki releases her from the Rokki-dan.  Desperate to follow her father, Magatsu finds her feverish and collapsed on the ground and reluctantly takes her with him as he attempts to catch up to Anotsu, during which Ryo makes the request for Magatsu to take her as a pupil. She later dies protecting her father from Hanabusa's gunners.\n*{{nihongo|'''Inroku Ban'''|\u4f34 \u6bb7\u516d|''Ban Inroku''}}: A member of the Rokki-dan's Onihana division.

A large man with a scar on the top of his head making it look lopsided and wears his hair in a series of coils. Fighting with large wide blades that can crush as well as cut, and possessing a heavily armored body that limits his opponent's avenues of attack, he proves to be a formidable opponent and manages to sever Manji's body in half during their fight.  Rin takes advantage of Arashino's pity and duplicituously makes it appear that Manji's body isn't recovering from damage and then sets Arashino's body on fire, allowing Manji gain the advantage to kill him.\n*{{nihongo|'''Shinhei Doma'''|\u5f29\u99ac \u5fc3\u5175}}: A member of the Rokki-dan's Onihana division, he uses a nunchaku-like weapon. Is skilled enough to survive fighting Makie, though he was forced to run when he is aware that continuing a battle with her will result in his death. He can extend his weapon and use a style of mid-range fighting called \"Skyward Snake\", a rapid technique which he claims to have not mastered but uses to put Makie on the defensive. Is killed by Makie in chapter 209 after the Rokki-dan fail to ambush her.\n*{{nihongo|'''Tarieshin Hasshu'''|\u516b\u5b97 \u8db3\u6c5f\u9032|''Hasshu Tarieshin''}}: A member of the Rokki-dan's Onihana division, a one-eyed man in western-style dress with a bandana who uses spear-like weapons.

Is killed by Amon, minor member of the Itto-ryu.\n*{{nihongo|'''Meguro'''|\u76ee\u9ed2}}: An attractive [[Kunoichi]] working for Kagimura as a member of the Rokki-dan. She is also a student of Master Sori, whom she is infatuated with, and becomes friends with Rin, who works as Sori's housekeeper. Her attempts to have him accept her affections are usually misconstrued and her artistic style and poor cooking ability do little to impress Sori, who appears to be oblivious.  Her real name is {{nihongo|''Koto''|\u3053\u3068}}.\n*{{nihongo|'''Tanpopo'''|\u305f\u3093\u307d\u307d}}: A Kunoichi of the Rokki-dan alongside Meguro.

Out of loyalty to Habaki, he accompanies him and helps organize the Rokki-dan in their pursuit of the Itto-ryu.  He, Doma, and Tarieshin combine their forces in attempt to kill Makie, but are hopelessly outmatched.  His hands are severed after Doma and Tarieshin are killed and he begs Giichi to kill Makie when Giichi enters the fray. After Habaki is slain by Anotsu, he commits seppuku with Magatsu's help.\n\n==Other characters==\n* {{nihongo|'''Yaobikuni'''|\u516b\u767e\u6bd4\u4e18\u5c3c|Yaobikuni}} {{anime voices|[[Hisako Kyoda]] (2008 anime), Ako Mayama (2019 anime)<ref name=\"2019-cast-3\"/>|[[Louise Chamis]]}}: As her name implies, she is an eight-hundred-year-old nun. She herself has the kessen-chu and has imparted these blood-worms to both Manji and Shizuma. Yaobikuni finds Rin Asano at the graveyard where Rin's father is buried. After hearing her story, Yaobikuni urges Rin to find the toughest, strongest [[Bodyguard|yojimbo]] of all: Manji. Yaobikuni is short in stature and has spiral tattoos on her face. She first appears in ''Criminal''.\n*{{nihongo|'''Machi'''|\u753a}} {{anime voices|[[Maaya Sakamoto]]|[[Cristina Vee]]}}: Manji's younger sister, who married an official named Sait\u014d Tatsumasa.  When Manji kills Tatsumasa in self-defence, Machi witnesses the act and is driven insane, regressing to a childlike mindset.  When she is killed by men seeking to take revenge against Manji, Manji sets out to redeem himself by killing 1000 evil men in exchange for removing his immortality.\n* {{nihongo|'''Johnny Gyobutsu '''|\u5e8f\u4ec1 \u9b5a\u4ecf|Jon\u012b Gyobutsu}} {{anime voices|[[Kohei Kiyasu]]|[[Liam O'Brien]]}}: An assassin fascinated by western apparel and practices. He poses as a [[Christians|Christian]] priest, collecting bounties on criminals who confess their sins with a [[flintlock]] pistol, marked with the word \"Divina\" on the barrel. Has the dubious honor of being Manji's first victim to appear in the graphic novel. His first appearance and death both occur in ''Criminal''. His name is a homage to [[John Lydon]]'s stage name while heading the British punk band [[Sex Pistols]], Johnny Rotten (\"Gyobutsu\" roughly translates as ''rotten fish'').\n* {{nihongo|'''Hishiyasu Shido'''|\u53f8\u6238\u3000\u83f1\u5b89|Shido Hishiyasu}} {{anime voices|[[Kentarou Itou]]|[[Kyle Hebert]]}}: Leader of the world's baddest ronin gang, the [[Shinsengumi]]. After Manji killed his brother \"Johnny\", Hishiyasu sought revenge by kidnapping Manji's sister, Machi, to use her as bait. When Manji would not submit to a duel, and offered only to fight barehanded, Hishiyasu lets Machi go only to kill her immediately after. He has two pronged swords that have the word \"ACID\" on the [[tsuba]]. After the death of his sister, Manji is able to accept his fate and proceeds to kill the entire ronin gang, starting with Shido Hishiyasu. His first appearance and death both occur in ''Criminal''. Like Johnny, he has his name based on a member of Sex Pistols, bassist [[Sid Vicious]] (being Shido's name an almost literal romanization).\n*{{nihongo|'''Sori'''|\u5b97\u7406}} {{anime voices|[[Tomokazu Seki]] (2019 anime)<ref name=\"2019-cast-3\"/>}}\n: A high-ranking spy and ninja obsessed with art, driven into political intrigue in order to gain access to European art, which is contraband in that period. Master S\u014dri has a daughter named Tatsu and is a childhood friend of the Asano clan. Rin goes to him hoping he will be another sword against Itt\u014d-ry\u016b. He refuses to offer any help at first but is soon able to provide Rin with thirty ry\u014d. He later assists Manji after he is injured, and informs him about who is behind the Mugai-ry\u016b. Also hires Magatsu to watch over his daughter while he is away painting, and is later revealed that may have greater interest in Magatsu (to which Manji notes after his conversation with Magatsu in volume 12, Autumn Frost). He first appears in Genius part 1.\n*{{nihongo|'''Tatsu'''|\u8fb0}}: Known also as Tatsub\u014d; Sori's daughter, a practical young woman who does not appear to be aware of most of her father's activities beyond sword fighting and is a childhood friend of Rin. She ends up taking care of Manji after he is severely injured by the Itto-Ryu while attempting to obtain a ''tsuko tegata'' to enter Kaga and follow Rin. She appears to be capable of taking care of her family's house, since Magatsu, who was hired by Sori to protect Tatsu, leaves with Manji in search of Shira even though Sori is still off painting.  By the time Rin and Manji return, Tatsu has apparently married a local merchant's son, while Rin winds up helping Sori out with household tasks.  She returns to her father's home after divorcing her husband because she had become fed up with how overbearing he was to her just as Rin and Manji are about to depart in search of Anotsu again.\n* {{nihongo|'''Renzo Kawakami'''|\u5ddd\u4e0a \u932c\u9020|Kawakami Renz\u014d}}: Son of Itto-Ryu member Araya Kawakami. Rin befriends him, only to discover his father was the one responsible for raping and then killing her mother.  She and Manji orchestrate a scene where it appears that Manji murdered Araya in cold blood and then was killed by Renzo so Renzo would not seek revenge like Rin.  After being orphaned by Manji, he is now Shira's hand both literally and figuratively.\n*{{nihongo|'''Shima Habaki'''|\u5410 \u5fd7\u6469|''Habaki Shima''}} {{nihongo|'''Sakutaro'''|\u5410 \u7d22\u592a\u90ce|''Habaki Sakutar\u014d''}}: The strong willed, proud and loyal wife of Habaki and his young son. When Habaki is condemned by his successor Hanabusa after failing to capture the Itto-ryu and producing results for the immortality experiment, Shima and Sakutaro are arrested in order to secure Habaki's cooperation.  When Ryo attempts to save them, Shima astutely realizes that Ryo is Habaki's illegitimate daughter.  To atone for her husband's perceived failure, Shima deliberately kills both their son and herself before Hanabusa and Habaki to ensure that Habaki will no longer have any obstacles to destroy the Itto-ryu.  Their deaths have a devastating impact on Habaki who cares greatly for both of them.\n*{{nihongo|'''Ugen Hanabusa'''|\u82f1\u4e8e\u5f66|''Hanabusa Ugen''}}: Previously subordinate to Habaki, Hanabusa becomes Habaki's successor when Habaki is forced to accept that he has failed to contain the Itto-ryu and produce successful results from the Immortality Experiment.  Though Hanabusa is cunning, his ability to scheme his way into ensuring Habaki's downfall by negotiating with the Itto-ryu fails largely due to Hanabusa's inability to match Habaki's ruthless determination and being unable to truly anticipate the movements of Anotsu and the Itto-ryu.\n\n==References==\n<references/>\n\n{{Blade of the Immortal}}\n\n[[Category:Lists of anime and manga characters|Blade of the Immortal]]\n", "name_user": "Jellysandwich0", "label": "safe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Blade_of_the_Immortal_characters"}

This is because Ravi Menon was the man behind Baba's imprisonment. However Sahadevan foils the plan as his dog Arjun sacrifices himself while retrieving a time bomb from the hospital where the minister was undergoing treatment. The blame is put on Sahadevan by Shankar but he is saved by the Director General of Police ([[Vijayaraghavan (actor)|Vijayaraghavan]]) who is his father's friend.\n\nShankar, along with Pitambaran intentionally makes sure Sahadevan fails his physical test because he foiled the bomb plan in the hospital. When he finds out who the crooks are he tries to find a way to foil it by starting over as a private detective via his uncle Karamchand alias Karunan Chanthakkavala ([[Captain Raju]]). Sahadevan becomes a private detective and calls himself CID Moosa, a short form of Moolamkuzhiyil Sahadevan. He has a funky car that can do tricks to assist him in evading his enemies. During all of this he falls in love with a girl named Meena ([[Bhavana (actress)|Bhavana]]). After numerous attempts, he makes her reciprocate.\n\nMeanwhile, he manages to intercept the first terrorists who had planned to place the bomb in the hospital. Shankar, in anger destroys Moosa's office saying it does not have a license.  When Moosa goes to Ravi for filing a complaint, Ravi's car explodes (as Baba's henchman had planted a bomb in it) and Moosa heroically saves him. Moosa is applauded for the same. He later accidentally kills the second terrorist member and gets a 5 lakh reward announced by the Government. Meena then tells Moosa that these terrorists were tenants in her house and had filed a complaint with Shankar, not realising that she would be arrested as she reaches her flat.\n\nShankar tries to molest Meena but Moosa intervenes and fights with him to save her. Later Shankar forces Ravi to issue a warrant against Moosa which he reluctantly accepts. On the way home, Ravi sees Baba on the road after he is released from prison.  Moosa meets Ravi to prove his innocence and then, Ravi tells him about Baba's enmity with him. Suddenly  Baba appears and shoots him in his arm. Moosa takes Ravi to safety in his car and uses the different tricks and devices in his car to evade the police who were following him. He is then intercepted by Shankar and Baba but shoots both of them using his wits and a little help from Arjun, his dog. Ravi is saved again and Moosa gets sent to [[Scotland]] to solve bigger cases.\n\n==Cast==\n\n* [[Dileep (actor)|Dileep]] as Moolamkuzhiyil Sahadevan / [[Crime Investigation Department (India)|C.I.D]] Moosa\n* [[Bhavana (actress)]] as Meena\n* [[Ashish Vidyarthi]] as Gowri Shankar IPS, Commissioner of Police \n* [[Murali (Malayalam actor)|Murali]] as [[Chief Minister|CM]] Ravi Menon\n* Arjun Rex (Dog) as Arjun\n* [[Jagathy Sreekumar]] as [[S.I.]] Peethambaran, Sahadevan's brother-in-law\n* [[Sharat Saxena]] as Khalid Muhammed Baba \n* [[Captain Raju]] as Karunan Chanthakkavala (Karamchand)\n* [[Abu Salim (actor)]] as C I George \n* [[Vijayaraghavan (actor)|Vijayaraghavan]] as D.I.G.

The awards were originally known as the '''Society of West End Theatre Awards''', but they were renamed in honour of the British actor [[Laurence Olivier]] in 1984.\n\nThe awards are given to individuals involved in [[West End theatre|West End]] productions and other leading [[West End theatre#London's non-commercial theatres|non-commercial theatres]] based in London across a range of categories covering plays, musicals, dance, opera and affiliate theatre. A discretionary non-competitive Special Olivier Award is also given each year. The Olivier Awards are recognised internationally as the highest honour in British theatre, equivalent to the [[British Academy of Film and Television Arts|BAFTA]] Awards for film and television, and the [[Brit Awards|BRIT Awards]] for music. The Olivier Awards are considered equivalent to [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]]'s [[Tony Award]]s and [[France]]'s [[Moli\u00e8re Award]].\n\nSince its inception, the awards have been held at various venues and theatres across London, from 2012-2016 at the [[Royal Opera House]], before moving to the [[Royal Albert Hall]] in 2017. Television coverage is broadcast in prime time on ITV, who acquired the rights from 2013 onwards with radio coverage by [[Magic Radio (London radio station)|Magic Radio]].\n\n==History==\nThe awards were first established in 1976 by the Society of London Theatre as the Society of West End Awards and were designed by artist Tom Merrifield. In 1984, British actor [[Laurence Olivier]] gave his consent for the awards to be renamed in his honour and they became known as the Laurence Olivier Awards.<ref>[https://officiallondontheatre.com/news/10-things-probably-didnt-know-olivier-awards/ \"10 Things You Probably Didn't Know About The Olivier Awards\"].

The awards were originally known as the '''Society of West End Theatre Awards''', but they were renamed in honour of the British actor [[Laurence Olivier]] in 1984.\n\nThe awards are given to individuals involved in [[West End theatre|West End]] productions and other leading [[West End theatre#London's non-commercial theatres|non-commercial theatres]] based in London across a range of categories covering plays, musicals, dance, opera and affiliate theatre. A discretionary non-competitive Special Olivier Award is also given each year. The Olivier Awards are recognised internationally as the highest honour in British theatre, equivalent to the [[British Academy of Film and Television Arts|BAFTA]] Awards for film and television, and the [[Brit Awards|BRIT Awards]] for music. The Olivier Awards are considered equivalent to [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]]'s [[Tony Award]]s and [[France]]'s [[Moli\u00e8re Award]].\n\nSince its inception, the awards have been held at various venues and theatres across London, from 2012-2016 at the [[Royal Opera House]], before moving to the [[Royal Albert Hall]] in 2017. Television coverage is broadcast in prime time on ITV, who acquired the rights from 2013 onwards with radio coverage by [[Magic Radio (London radio station)|Magic Radio]].\n\n==History==\nThe awards were first established in 1976 by the Society of London Theatre as the Society of West End Awards and were designed by artist Tom Merrifield.
