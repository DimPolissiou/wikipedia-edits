It admits [[Education in Thailand|upper-secondary]] students (''mathayom'' 4\u20136, equivalent to grades 10\u201312) and has the largest yearly enrolment in the country. Founded in 1938 as a [[University-preparatory school|preparatory school]] for [[Chulalongkorn University]], the school has long been regarded as the best secondary school in Thailand,<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Fry|first=Gerald W.|title=Education and Success: A Case Study of the Thai Public Service|periodical=[[Comparative Education Review]]|volume=24|issue=1|date=February 1980}}</ref> and attracts students from all over the country in its highly competitive entrance examinations.\n\n== History ==\nThe founding of Triam Udom Suksa School relates to the revised National Education Plan of BE&nbsp;2479 (1936&nbsp;CE), which imposed four and six years of [[primary education|primary]] and [[secondary education]] respectively, with an additional two years of pre-collegiate schooling required for students who were to pursue higher education. This pre-collegiate level was to be initially provided by the students' prospective universities, and accordingly the University Council of [[Chulalongkorn University]] authorised the establishment of such a school on 3 January 1938. The founding of the school, which took place over a tight time frame of three months, was overseen by Mom Luang [[Pin Malakul]], then head of the university's teacher-preparation programme, who became the school's first director. The school took over the location of Mathayom Horwang School (of which ML Pin was also headmaster) on Phaya Thai Road in the vicinity of the university, and became known as the \"University Preparatory School, Chulalongkorn University\", or ''Rong Rian Triam Udom Suksa Haeng Chulalongkorn Maha Witthayalai'' ({{lang|th|\u0e42\u0e23\u0e07\u0e40\u0e23\u0e35\u0e22\u0e19\u0e40\u0e15\u0e23\u0e35\u0e22\u0e21\u0e2d\u0e38\u0e14\u0e21\u0e28\u0e36\u0e01\u0e29\u0e32\u0e41\u0e2b\u0e48\u0e07\u0e08\u0e38\u0e2c\u0e32\u0e25\u0e07\u0e01\u0e23\u0e13\u0e21\u0e2b\u0e32\u0e27\u0e34\u0e17\u0e22\u0e32\u0e25\u0e31\u0e22}}). The school, which was the first [[co-education]]al in the country, opened on 16 May 1938, and classes began on 19 May.<ref name=\"Brief History\">{{Citation | last = Malakul  | first = Pin | author-link = Pin Malakul | title= Brief history of Triam Udom Suksa School. | year = 1982}} Reprint in Janehutthakarnkij et al. 2007, pp. 33\u201353</ref>\n\n[[File:Building 2, Triam Udom Suksa School, June 1940.jpg|thumb|left|Triam Udom Suksa Building (now Building&nbsp;2) during its opening ceremony on 24 June 1940]]\nThe school rapidly grew over the first few years, admitting up to 568 students in the 1940 academic year. In December 1941, following the signing of Thai-Japanese treaties on 8 and 12 December,<ref>{{cite book |last1=Staniczek |first1=Lukasz |title=Pibun Songkram 's Role in Thailand's Entry into the Pacific War |date=1999 |publisher=Ouachita Baptist University |location=Arkadelphia |url=https://scholarlycommons.obu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1152&context=honors_theses |pages=29-32|accessdate=2 April 2020 |format=Thesis}}</ref> the school was occupied by Japanese forces, forcing the staff and students to relocate to temporary locations around Bangkok. Teaching was hence adversely affected throughout the time of war. Classes briefly returned to the school in 1943, but had to again leave after the school was damaged by Allied bombing on 19 January 1944. Part of the staff and students were transferred to various cities around the country, where preparations had already taken place for the establishment of additional preparatory school campuses. (Changes of government policy would however later cause these campuses to close down.) The school remained occupied even at the conclusion of the war, this time by Allied forces.<ref name=\"Brief History\" />\n\n[[File:CUPS class 1 graduation.jpg|thumb|right|upright=0.67|Class 1 graduates as they proceed towards the university campus during Chulalongkorn University's initiation ceremony, 1 June 1940]]\nTeaching finally returned to normal in 1946 after Allied forces withdrew from the school. During that period, government policy favoured expanding pre-collegiate level teaching to public schools under the Department of General Education instead of being provided by the universities. As a result, authority over the school was transferred from Chulalongkorn University to the Department of General Education on 1 July 1947. The school's students have since been required to take university entrance examinations as regular students, and the name of the school was shortened to \"Triam Udom Suksa School\". The school, however, retained use of the [[Phra Kiao]] as its symbol.<ref name=\"Brief History\" />\n\nIn June 1947, just prior to the transfer, a Teacher Training Department was created under the school's authority to support the expansion of the national school system. This department, which became known as the ''Satit'' (demonstration) School, would extend teaching to ''mathayom'' 1\u20136 levels, and authority was transferred to the College of Education (now [[Srinakharinwirot University]]) in 1955. It presently exists as [[Patumwan Demonstration School, Srinakharinwirot University|Patumwan Demonstration School]].<ref name=\"Brief History\" /> As Triam Udom is considered as the best high school in the country, Pathumwan Demonstration School ranked one of the best school as a biggest feeding school to Triam Udom in recent years.\n\nThe demand for pre-collegiate level schooling saw a sharp increase in the late 1950s, resulting in the Department of Secondary Education setting up special pre-collegiate schools within regular school campuses. Such a school was set up near Orachon Canal in the eastern portion of Triam Udom Suksa School in 1958, and became known as \"Triam Orachon\". Another campus, Triam Bang Pu, was established at Bang Pu Seaside Resort in [[Samut Prakan Province]] before being moved to [[Amphoe Sam Phran|Sam Phran District]], [[Nakhon Pathom Province]], and became known as Triam Udom Suksa Sam Phran School. Both schools were merged with Triam Udom Suksa by 1964.<ref name=\"Brief History\" />\n\n[[File:Building 1, Triam Udom Suksa School.jpg|thumb|left|The name of Mathayom Horwang School is still displayed on the fa\u00e7ade of Building&nbsp;1.]]\nIn 1960, the national curriculum was rewritten, and the educational stages were redefined with seven years' primary education and five years of secondary education. Two years' upper-secondary education, ''mathayom'' 4\u20135, replaced the pre-collegiate level. The school now taught in this level, and classes were divided into arts, sciences and general departments. The curriculum would be changed again in 1981, introducing the current three-year upper-secondary level (''mathayom'' 4\u20136).<ref name=\"70th Anniversary\">Janehutthakarnkij et al. 2007.</ref>\n\nSince the 1950s, the school staff have on multiple occasions been assigned by the Ministry of Education to assist other schools in staff training and teaching strategy development. In anticipation of the possible need to relocate in the 1970s, the school helped found the [[Bodindecha (Sing Singhaseni) School|Bodindecha]] and [[Triam Udom Suksa Pattanakarn School|Triam Udom Suksa Pattanakarn]] Schools in 1975 and 1978. Queen's College, Ratchaburi was established with like assistance in 1992.\n\nThe school saw further expansion in the 1980s, partly due to the new national curriculum, and now had ninety classes. Several new buildings were built, and modern facilities were introduced, including the introduction of computer classes in 1992. The school received awards from the Department of General Education in 1982 and 1985, and the school library won awards in 1990 and 1991. Students featured prominently in national stages, and since 1990 have continuously won medals at the [[International Science Olympiad]]s.\n\nAt present, Triam Udom Suksa School educates upper-secondary students in the ''mathayom'' 4\u20136 levels. As of the 2017 academic year, there are 111 classes with 4,280 students and 219 teachers.<ref>Triam Udom Suksa School 2017b, p. 16.</ref>{{efn|name=teachers}}\n\n==Campus==\n[[File:Campus plan of Triam Udom Suksa School.png|thumb|right|Campus plan]]\nTriam Udom Suksa School is located at 227 [[Phaya Thai Road]], [[Pathum Wan]], Bangkok, amongst the campus of [[Chulalongkorn University]].

Other buildings include the library (Building&nbsp;4), auditorium, science lab, gymnasium, Building&nbsp;8, and the 50th Anniversary Building, which holds many of the student clubs.\n\n==Curriculum==\nThe school's curriculum is based on the Basic Education Core Curriculum B.E.&nbsp;2551 (2008&nbsp;CE), and provides three years of upper-secondary education, ''mathayom'' 4\u20136. Subjects are grouped into eight learning areas, namely [[Thai language]]; [[mathematics]]; [[science]]; [[social studies]], religion and culture; [[Health education|health]] and [[physical education]]; arts; vocations and technology; and foreign languages.<ref name=\"curriculum\">Triam Udomm Suksa School 2017b, p. 29.</ref>\n\nUpon admission, students choose a concentration path which determines the subjects they take. All students take the same basic subjects in all eight areas. Additional courses follow the three major concentrations: science\u2013mathematics, language\u2013mathematics, and language (chosen among French, German, Japanese, Spanish, Chinese or Korean). Additional elective subjects are available depending on the students' major. An additional number of activity hours, consisting of guidance class and clubs, are also required.<ref name=\"curriculum\" />\n\nAdmission to the school is mainly through examinations, although there are also designated quotas for students with specific abilities and achievements. The examination process is highly competitive; over 10,000 students applied for 1,100 available seats in the 2019 academic year.<ref>{{Cite news|title=Thousands vie for place in prestigious Triam Udom Suksa School|newspaper=The Nation|date=10 March 2019|url=https://www.nationthailand.com/news/30365529|accessdate=29 February 2020}}</ref>\n\n==Academics==\n[[File:Room 111, Triam Udom Suksa School.jpg|thumb|Room 111, with its display of trophies and name plaques honouring top graduates, King's Scholarship recipients and International Science Olympiad medallists]]\n\nTriam Udom Suksa School has among the highest national standardized test scores in the country, competing only with [[Mahidol Wittayanusorn School]] for the top rank.

It admits [[Education in Thailand|upper-secondary]] students (''mathayom'' 4\u20136, equivalent to grades 10\u201312) and has the largest yearly enrolment in the country. Founded in 1938 as a [[University-preparatory school|preparatory school]] for [[Chulalongkorn University]], the school has long been regarded as the best secondary school in Thailand,<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Fry|first=Gerald W.|title=Education and Success: A Case Study of the Thai Public Service|periodical=[[Comparative Education Review]]|volume=24|issue=1|date=February 1980}}</ref> and attracts students from all over the country in its highly competitive entrance examinations.\n\n== History ==\nThe founding of Triam Udom Suksa School relates to the revised National Education Plan of BE&nbsp;2479 (1936&nbsp;CE), which imposed four and six years of [[primary education|primary]] and [[secondary education]] respectively, with an additional two years of pre-collegiate schooling required for students who were to pursue higher education. This pre-collegiate level was to be initially provided by the students' prospective universities, and accordingly the University Council of [[Chulalongkorn University]] authorised the establishment of such a school on 3 January 1938. The founding of the school, which took place over a tight time frame of three months, was overseen by Mom Luang [[Pin Malakul]], then head of the university's teacher-preparation programme, who became the school's first director. The school took over the location of Mathayom Horwang School (of which ML Pin was also headmaster) on Phaya Thai Road in the vicinity of the university, and became known as the \"University Preparatory School, Chulalongkorn University\", or ''Rong Rian Triam Udom Suksa Haeng Chulalongkorn Maha Witthayalai'' ({{lang|th|\u0e42\u0e23\u0e07\u0e40\u0e23\u0e35\u0e22\u0e19\u0e40\u0e15\u0e23\u0e35\u0e22\u0e21\u0e2d\u0e38\u0e14\u0e21\u0e28\u0e36\u0e01\u0e29\u0e32\u0e41\u0e2b\u0e48\u0e07\u0e08\u0e38\u0e2c\u0e32\u0e25\u0e07\u0e01\u0e23\u0e13\u0e21\u0e2b\u0e32\u0e27\u0e34\u0e17\u0e22\u0e32\u0e25\u0e31\u0e22}}). The school, which was the first [[co-education]]al in the country, opened on 16 May 1938, and classes began on 19 May.<ref name=\"Brief History\">{{Citation | last = Malakul  | first = Pin | author-link = Pin Malakul | title= Brief history of Triam Udom Suksa School. | year = 1982}} Reprint in Janehutthakarnkij et al. 2007, pp. 33\u201353</ref>\n\n[[File:Building 2, Triam Udom Suksa School, June 1940.jpg|thumb|left|Triam Udom Suksa Building (now Building&nbsp;2) during its opening ceremony on 24 June 1940]]\nThe school rapidly grew over the first few years, admitting up to 568 students in the 1940 academic year. In December 1941, following the signing of Thai-Japanese treaties,<ref>{{cite book |last1=Staniczek |first1=Lukasz |title=Pibun Songkram 's Role in Thailand's Entry into the Pacific War |date=1999 |publisher=Ouachita Baptist University |location=Arkadelphia |url=https://scholarlycommons.obu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1152&context=honors_theses |pages=29-32|accessdate=2 April 2020 |format=Thesis}}</ref> the school was occupied by Japanese forces, forcing the staff and students to relocate to temporary locations around Bangkok. Teaching was hence adversely affected throughout the time of war. Classes briefly returned to the school in 1943, but had to again leave after the school was damaged by Allied bombing on 19 January 1944. Part of the staff and students were transferred to various cities around the country, where preparations had already taken place for the establishment of additional preparatory school campuses. (Changes of government policy would however later cause these campuses to close down.) The school remained occupied even at the conclusion of the war, this time by Allied forces.<ref name=\"Brief History\" />\n\n[[File:CUPS class 1 graduation.jpg|thumb|right|upright=0.67|Class 1 graduates as they proceed towards the university campus during Chulalongkorn University's initiation ceremony, 1 June 1940]]\nTeaching finally returned to normal in 1946 after Allied forces withdrew from the school. During that period, government policy favoured expanding pre-collegiate level teaching to public schools under the Department of General Education instead of being provided by the universities. As a result, authority over the school was transferred from Chulalongkorn University to the Department of General Education on 1 July 1947. The school's students have since been required to take university entrance examinations as regular students, and the name of the school was shortened to \"Triam Udom Suksa School\". The school, however, retained use of the [[Phra Kiao]] as its symbol.<ref name=\"Brief History\" />\n\nIn June 1947, just prior to the transfer, a Teacher Training Department was created under the school's authority to support the expansion of the national school system. This department, which became known as the ''Satit'' (demonstration) School, would extend teaching to ''mathayom'' 1\u20136 levels, and authority was transferred to the College of Education (now [[Srinakharinwirot University]]) in 1955. It presently exists as [[Patumwan Demonstration School, Srinakharinwirot University|Patumwan Demonstration School]].<ref name=\"Brief History\" /> As Triam Udom is considered as the best high school in the country, Pathumwan Demonstration School ranked one of the best school as a biggest feeding school to Triam Udom in recent years.\n\nThe demand for pre-collegiate level schooling saw a sharp increase in the late 1950s, resulting in the Department of Secondary Education setting up special pre-collegiate schools within regular school campuses. Such a school was set up near Orachon Canal in the eastern portion of Triam Udom Suksa School in 1958, and became known as \"Triam Orachon\". Another campus, Triam Bang Pu, was established at Bang Pu Seaside Resort in [[Samut Prakan Province]] before being moved to [[Amphoe Sam Phran|Sam Phran District]], [[Nakhon Pathom Province]], and became known as Triam Udom Suksa Sam Phran School. Both schools were merged with Triam Udom Suksa by 1964.<ref name=\"Brief History\" />\n\n[[File:Building 1, Triam Udom Suksa School.jpg|thumb|left|The name of Mathayom Horwang School is still displayed on the fa\u00e7ade of Building&nbsp;1.]]\nIn 1960, the national curriculum was rewritten, and the educational stages were redefined with seven years' primary education and five years of secondary education. Two years' upper-secondary education, ''mathayom'' 4\u20135, replaced the pre-collegiate level. The school now taught in this level, and classes were divided into arts, sciences and general departments. The curriculum would be changed again in 1981, introducing the current three-year upper-secondary level (''mathayom'' 4\u20136).<ref name=\"70th Anniversary\">Janehutthakarnkij et al. 2007.</ref>\n\nSince the 1950s, the school staff have on multiple occasions been assigned by the Ministry of Education to assist other schools in staff training and teaching strategy development. In anticipation of the possible need to relocate in the 1970s, the school helped found the [[Bodindecha (Sing Singhaseni) School|Bodindecha]] and [[Triam Udom Suksa Pattanakarn School|Triam Udom Suksa Pattanakarn]] Schools in 1975 and 1978. Queen's College, Ratchaburi was established with like assistance in 1992.\n\nThe school saw further expansion in the 1980s, partly due to the new national curriculum, and now had ninety classes. Several new buildings were built, and modern facilities were introduced, including the introduction of computer classes in 1992. The school received awards from the Department of General Education in 1982 and 1985, and the school library won awards in 1990 and 1991. Students featured prominently in national stages, and since 1990 have continuously won medals at the [[International Science Olympiad]]s.\n\nAt present, Triam Udom Suksa School educates upper-secondary students in the ''mathayom'' 4\u20136 levels.

The oldest buildings are lined along the school's main roadway which connects the two major roads bordering the school. The other buildings are scattered around the school campus, which is dominated by the sports field.\n\nThe oldest building, Building&nbsp;1, was built in 1935 as the new site for the Mathayom Horwang School of Chulalongkorn University when it relocated from its former [[Windsor Palace (Thailand)|Windsor Palace]] site, and has been home to Triam Udom Suksa School since 1938. Designed with influences from the [[De Stijl]] movement by Italian architect [[Ercole Manfredi]], it is regarded as the first use of [[modernist architecture]] in a Thai educational building.<ref>Noobanjong, p. 362.</ref><ref name=\"Chomchon\">{{cite thesis|last1=Fusinpaiboon|first1=Chomchon|title=Modernisation of Building: The Transplantation of the Concept of Architecture from Europe to Thailand, 1930s\u20131950s|type=PhD thesis|date=April 2014|publisher=University of Sheffield|url=http://etheses.whiterose.ac.uk/5698/|accessdate=5 January 2017}}</ref> Construction of Building&nbsp;2, originally known as Triam Udom Suka Building and serving as the school's main building, followed in 1938. It was designed by Thai engineer Kimchuang (Kanchana) Hengsuwanit.

Other buildings include the library (Building&nbsp;4), auditorium, science lab, gymnasium, Building&nbsp;8, and the 50th Anniversary Building, which holds many of the student clubs.\n\n==Curriculum==\nThe school's curriculum is based on the Basic Education Core Curriculum B.E.&nbsp;2551 (2008&nbsp;CE), and provides three years of upper-secondary education, ''mathayom'' 4\u20136. Subjects are grouped into eight learning areas, namely [[Thai language]]; [[mathematics]]; [[science]]; [[social studies]], religion and culture; [[Health education|health]] and [[physical education]]; arts; vocations and technology; and foreign languages.<ref name=\"curriculum\">Triam Udomm Suksa School 2017b, p. 29.</ref>\n\nUpon admission, students choose a concentration path which determines the subjects they take. All students take the same basic subjects in all eight areas. Additional courses follow the three major concentrations: science\u2013mathematics, language\u2013mathematics, and language (chosen among French, German, Japanese, Spanish, Chinese or Korean). Additional elective subjects are available depending on the students' major. An additional number of activity hours, consisting of guidance class and clubs, are also required.<ref name=\"curriculum\" />\n\nAdmission to the school is mainly through examinations, although there are also designated quotas for students with specific abilities and achievements. The examination process is highly competitive; over 10,000 students applied for 1,100 available seats in the 2019 academic year.<ref>{{Cite news|title=Thousands vie for place in prestigious Triam Udom Suksa School|newspaper=The Nation|date=10 March 2019|url=https://www.nationthailand.com/news/30365529|accessdate=29 February 2020}}</ref>\n\n==Academics==\n[[File:Room 111, Triam Udom Suksa School.jpg|thumb|Room 111, with its display of trophies and name plaques honouring top graduates, King's Scholarship recipients and International Science Olympiad medallists]]\n\nTriam Udom Suksa School has among the highest national standardized test scores in the country, competing only with [[Mahidol Wittayanusorn School]] for the top rank.

The book tells the story of the Baudelaire orphans, as they are sent to live with a distant relative named Montgomery Montgomery. The villainous Count Olaf arrives in an attempt to steal the children's inheritance, killing their guardian, but failing to steal the fortune. Olaf tried to say that the Mamba du Mal killed him but Olaf took Montgomery\u2019s sample of Mamba du Mal\u2019s snake poison and had it injected into Montgomery\u2019s body.\nMontgomery is dead dead by a Snake\n\n==Plot==\nThe three Baudelaire orphans have been placed under the care of their closest living relative, [[Herpetology|herpetologist]] Dr. Montgomery Montgomery. \"Uncle Monty\", as he prefers to be called, is a short, chubby man with a round, red face. The children immediately like him. He lets them each choose their own bedroom and informs them that they are going to accompany him on a trip to [[Peru]] to study snakes.\n\nThe children are fascinated by the many snakes in the \"Reptile Room\", a giant hall in which their Uncle Monty's reptile collection is stored. They meet the Incredibly Deadly Viper, which Uncle Monty recently discovered, whose name is actually a misnomer (the snake is harmless and friendly). The three children are each given jobs in the Reptile Room: Violet is given the job of inventing traps for new snakes found in Peru, Klaus is told to read books on snakes to help advise Uncle Monty, and Sunny's job is to bite ropes into usable pieces.\n\nWhen Stephano, the successor of the original assistant Gustav arrives, the children realize immediately that he is Count Olaf in disguise. Count Olaf is a villain who the children used to live with, until he was caught trying to steal the fortune left behind by their parents. They try to warn Uncle Monty. They manage to talk to Monty alone the day before their trip to Peru, but Monty is convinced that Stephano is a spy trying to steal information from his research and fails to understand their claims that Stephano is Olaf. He tears up Stephano's ticket to Peru. The following morning, the Baudelaires discover Monty's dead body.\nStephano still tries to take the children to Peru. However, as they are leaving the estate, Stephano's car crashes into Mr. Poe's car. They return to the house, where Poe and Stephano discuss what to do with the children. Mr. Poe refuses to believe the children when they say Stephano is Count Olaf in disguise, as Stephano lacks a tattoo of an eye on his ankle. Dr. Lucafont arrives and performs an autopsy, claiming Monty was killed by the Mamba du Mal.\n\nViolet tells her siblings to cause a distraction; the Incredibly Deadly Viper pretends to attack Sunny, while Violet creates a lockpick from the charger of Klaus' reading lamp. She then uses it to open Count Olaf's suitcase to reveal needles with the venom from a snake as well as some powder that he used to cover up the eye tattoo. Klaus reveals to Mr. Poe, Dr. Lucafont and Count Olaf that, from his studies of the Mamba du Mal, if the Mamba du Mal attacked Uncle Monty he would be black, while Monty was pale. Violet shows her evidence, and Mr. Poe rubs away the powder on Stephano's ankle to reveal the eye tattoo, proving Stephano was Olaf.

The book tells the story of the Baudelaire orphans, as they are sent to live with a distant relative named Montgomery Montgomery. The villainous Count Olaf arrives in an attempt to steal the children's inheritance, killing their guardian, but failing to steal the fortune. Olaf tried to say that the Mamba du Mal killed him but Olaf took Montgomery\u2019s sample of Mamba du Mal\u2019s snake poison and had it injected into Montgomery\u2019s body.\n\n==Plot==\nThe three Baudelaire orphans have been placed under the care of their closest living relative, [[Herpetology|herpetologist]] Dr. Montgomery Montgomery. \"Uncle Monty\", as he prefers to be called, is a short, chubby man with a round, red face. The children immediately like him. He lets them each choose their own bedroom and informs them that they are going to accompany him on a trip to [[Peru]] to study snakes.\n\nThe children are fascinated by the many snakes in the \"Reptile Room\", a giant hall in which their Uncle Monty's reptile collection is stored. They meet the Incredibly Deadly Viper, which Uncle Monty recently discovered, whose name is actually a misnomer (the snake is harmless and friendly). The three children are each given jobs in the Reptile Room: Violet is given the job of inventing traps for new snakes found in Peru, Klaus is told to read books on snakes to help advise Uncle Monty, and Sunny's job is to bite ropes into usable pieces.\n\nWhen Stephano, the successor of the original assistant Gustav arrives, the children realize immediately that he is Count Olaf in disguise. Count Olaf is a villain who the children used to live with, until he was caught trying to steal the fortune left behind by their parents. They try to warn Uncle Monty. They manage to talk to Monty alone the day before their trip to Peru, but Monty is convinced that Stephano is a spy trying to steal information from his research and fails to understand their claims that Stephano is Olaf. He tears up Stephano's ticket to Peru. The following morning, the Baudelaires discover Monty's dead body.\nStephano still tries to take the children to Peru. However, as they are leaving the estate, Stephano's car crashes into Mr. Poe's car. They return to the house, where Poe and Stephano discuss what to do with the children. Mr. Poe refuses to believe the children when they say Stephano is Count Olaf in disguise, as Stephano lacks a tattoo of an eye on his ankle. Dr. Lucafont arrives and performs an autopsy, claiming Monty was killed by the Mamba du Mal.\n\nViolet tells her siblings to cause a distraction; the Incredibly Deadly Viper pretends to attack Sunny, while Violet creates a lockpick from the charger of Klaus' reading lamp. She then uses it to open Count Olaf's suitcase to reveal needles with the venom from a snake as well as some powder that he used to cover up the eye tattoo. Klaus reveals to Mr. Poe, Dr. Lucafont and Count Olaf that, from his studies of the Mamba du Mal, if the Mamba du Mal attacked Uncle Monty he would be black, while Monty was pale. Violet shows her evidence, and Mr. Poe rubs away the powder on Stephano's ankle to reveal the eye tattoo, proving Stephano was Olaf. However, Olaf manages to escape when Dr. Lucafont (the hook handed man in disguise) helps him get away, leaving Mr. Poe to take the orphans to a new home.\n\n== Foreshadowing ==\nIn the final picture, one of the men is wearing a shirt that reads Lachrymose Leeches, which is a hint to the next book: ''[[The Wide Window]]''.\n\n==Critical reception==\n''[[Publishers Weekly]]'' said Snicket \"uses formal, Latinate language and intrusive commentary to hilarious effect\" and complimented Helquist's \"exquisitely detailed drawings of Gothic gargoyles and mischievous eyes\", which were said to \"echo the contents of this elegantly designed hardcover\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.publishersweekly.com/978-0-06-440767-0|title=The Reptile Room|work=[[Publishers Weekly]]|accessdate=27 August 2015}}</ref>\n\n==Other editions==\n\n===Audiobook===\nThe audiobook version of \"The Reptile Room\" was read by [[Tim Curry]].
