I, p. 4: At the same time that the IRA operation began to focus on supporting candidate Trump in early 2016, the Russian government employed a second form of interference: cyber intrusions (hacking) and releases of hacked materials damaging to the Clinton Campaign. The Russian intelligence service known as the Main Intelligence Directorate of the General Staff of the Russian Army (GRU) carried out these operations. In March 2016, the GRU began hacking the email accounts of Clinton Campaign volunteers and employees, including campaign chairman John Podesta. In April 2016, the GRU hacked into the computer networks of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee (DCCC) and the Democratic National Committee (DNC). The GRU stole hundreds of thousands of documents from the compromised email accounts and networks. Around the time that the DNC announced in mid-June 2016 the Russian government's role in hacking its network, the GRU began disseminating stolen materials through the fictitious online personas \"DCLeaks\" and \"Guccifer 2.0.\" The GRU later released additional materials through the organization WikiLeaks.</ref>\n\nTo establish whether a crime was committed by members of the Trump campaign with regard to Russian interference, the special counsel's investigators \"applied the framework of [[Conspiracy (criminal)|conspiracy law]]\", and not the concept of \"collusion\", because collusion \"is not a specific offense or theory of liability found in the United States Code, nor is it a term of art in federal criminal law.\"<ref>{{Cite web |last1=Morais |first1=Betsy |title=Collusion by any other name |url=https://www.cjr.org/first_person/trump-mueller-collusion.php |date=April 18, 2019 |work=[[Columbia Journalism Review]] |access-date=April 23, 2019}}</ref><ref>''[https://www.justice.gov/storage/report.pdf Mueller Report]'', vol. I, p. 2: In evaluating whether evidence about the collective action of multiple individuals constituted a crime, we applied the framework of conspiracy law, not the concept of \"collusion.\" In so doing, the Office recognized that the word \"collud[e]\" was used in communications with the Acting Attorney General confirming certain aspects of the investigation's scope and that the term has frequently been invoked in public reporting about the investigation. But collusion is not a specific offense or theory of liability found in the United States Code, nor is it a term of art in federal criminal law. For those reasons, the Office's focus in analyzing questions of joint criminal liability was on conspiracy as defined in federal law.</ref> They also investigated if members of the Trump campaign \"coordinated\" with Russia, using the definition of \"coordination\" as having \"an agreement\u2014tacit or express\u2014between the Trump campaign and the Russian government on election interference\". Investigators further elaborated that merely having \"two parties taking actions that were informed by or responsive to the other's actions or interests\" was not enough to establish coordination.<!-- ref name=NYTcompare/ --><ref>''[https://www.justice.gov/storage/report.pdf Mueller Report]'', vol.

Like collusion, \"coordination\" does not have a settled definition in federal criminal law. We understood coordination to require an agreement\u2014tacit or express\u2014between the Trump Campaign and the Russian government on election interference.

The study points out that since the 1980s, the advancement of technology has often led to a significant fraction of the workforce being worse off. Low skilled workers affected by [[Technological unemployment|technology driven job displacement]] had to replace their middle-income jobs with lower-income service jobs, or were pushed out of the workforce altogether, while the advancement of technology increased the demand for high-income jobs among skilled workers. Frey and his co-authors note a positive trend between automation driven income inequality and the movement toward [[political polarization]] in the United States. The study found a strong correlation between areas affected by technological automation and the increase of support for Donald Trump among low-skilled workers in the affected voting districts, concluding that:<blockquote>While the Computer Revolution has not rendered the workforce redundant, a large share of Americans have lost the race to technology, which is reflected in the reallocation of millions of workers from middle-income jobs to low-income occupations or non-employment as their jobs have been automated away{{nbsp}}... the victims of the Computer Revolution have a higher propensity to opt for radical political change: electoral districts with a higher share of jobs exposed to automation were significantly more likely to support Trump. The 2016 U.S. Presidential Election can thus be described as a riot against machines by democratic means.<ref>{{Cite web|last=Frey|first=Carl Benedikt|last2=Berger|first2=Thor|last3=Chen|first3=Chinchih|date=July 23, 2017|title=Political Machinery: Automation Anxiety and the 2016 U.S. Presidential Election|url=https://www.oxfordmartin.ox.ac.uk/downloads/academic/Political%20Machinery-Automation%20Anxiety%20and%20the%202016%20U_S_%20Presidential%20Election_230712.pdf}}</ref></blockquote>\n\n=== Candidates table ===\n\n<!-- This table is sorted by pledged electors first (that is, ignoring faithless electors), then by popular vote among candidates with 0 pledged electors. -->\n{{start U.S. presidential ticket box|pv_footnote=|ev_footnote=}}\n{{U.S. presidential ticket box rowspan|name=[[Donald Trump]]|party=[[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]]|state=[[New York (state)|New York]]|pv= 62,984,828 |pv_pct= 46.09% |ev-projected=306|ev=304 (306)|vp_count=1|vp_name=[[Mike Pence]]|vp_party=[[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]]|vp_state=[[Indiana]]|vp_ev=304}}\n{{U.S. presidential ticket box rowspan|name=[[Hillary Clinton]]|party=[[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]]|state=[[New York (state)|New York]]|pv= 65,853,514 |pv_pct= 48.18% |ev-projected=232|ev=227 (232)|vp_count=1|vp_name=[[Tim Kaine]]|vp_party=[[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]]|vp_state=[[Virginia]]|vp_ev=227}}\n{{U.S. presidential ticket box row|name=[[Gary Johnson]]| party=[[Libertarian Party (United States)|Libertarian]]| state=[[New Mexico]]| pv= 4,489,341 | pv_pct= 3.28% | ev-projected=0| ev=0| vp_name=[[Bill Weld]]| vp_party=[[Libertarian Party (United States)|Libertarian]]| vp_state=[[Massachusetts]]}}\n{{U.S. presidential ticket box row|name=[[Jill Stein]]| party=[[Green Party of the United States|Green]]| state=[[Massachusetts]]| pv= 1,457,218 | pv_pct= 1.07% | ev-projected=0| ev=0| vp_name=[[Ajamu Baraka]]| vp_party=[[Green Party (United States)|Green]]| vp_state=[[Illinois]]}}\n{{U.S. presidential ticket box row| name=[[Evan McMullin]]| party=[[Independent politician|Independent]]| state=[[Utah]]| pv= 731,991 | pv_pct= 0.54% | ev-projected=0| ev=0| vp_name=[[Mindy Finn]]| vp_party=[[Independent politician|Independent]]| vp_state=[[District of Columbia]]}}\n{{U.S. presidential ticket box row| name=[[Darrell Castle]]|| party=[[Constitution Party (United States)|Constitution]]| state=[[Tennessee]]| pv= 203,090 | pv_pct= 0.15% | ev-projected=0| ev=0| vp_name=[[Scott Bradley (politician)|Scott Bradley]]| vp_party=[[Constitution Party (United States)|Constitution]]| vp_state=[[Utah]]}}\n{{U.S. presidential ticket box rowspan| name=[[Bernie Sanders]]{{efn|name=faithless}}| party=[[Independent politician|Independent]]| state=[[Vermont]]| pv= 111,850 {{efn|name=write-in}}| pv_pct= 0.08% {{efn|name=write-in}}| ev-projected=0| ev=1 (0)| vp_count=1| vp_name=[[Elizabeth Warren]]{{efn|name=faithless}}|vp_party=[[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]]| vp_state=[[Massachusetts]]| vp_ev=1}}\n{{U.S. presidential ticket box row|name=[[Gloria La Riva]]|party=[[Party for Socialism and Liberation|Socialism and Liberation]]|state=[[California]]| pv= 74,401 | pv_pct= 0.05% | ev-projected=0| ev=0| vp_name=[[Eugene Puryear]]|vp_party=[[Party for Socialism and Liberation|Socialism and Liberation]]| vp_state=[[District of Columbia]]}}\n{{U.S. presidential ticket box rowspan| name=[[John Kasich]]{{efn|name=faithless}}{{efn|name=paul-kasich|Two faithless electors from Texas cast their presidential votes for Ron Paul and John Kasich, respectively.

These models mostly showed a Democratic advantage since the nominees were confirmed, and were supported by pundits and statisticians, including [[Nate Silver]] of FiveThirtyEight, Nate Cohn at ''The New York Times'', and [[Larry Sabato]] from the Crystal Ball newsletter, who predicted a Democratic victory in competitive presidential races and projected consistent leads in several battleground states around the country.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2016/upshot/presidential-polls-forecast.html |title=Who will be president?

However, FiveThirtyEight's model pointed to the possibility of an Electoral College-popular vote split widening in the final weeks based on Trump's improvement in swing states like Florida or Pennsylvania. This was due to the demographics targeted by Trump's campaign which lived in big numbers there, in addition to Clinton's poor performance in several of those swing states in comparison with Obama's performance in 2012, as well as having a big number of her potential voters in very populated traditionally 'blue' states, but also in some very populated states traditionally 'red', like Texas, which were projected safe for Trump.<ref>{{Cite news |url=http://fivethirtyeight.com/features/how-trump-could-win-the-white-house-while-losing-the-popular-vote/ |title=How Trump Could Win The White House While Losing The Popular Vote |last=Wasserman |first=David |date=September 15, 2016 |newspaper=FiveThirtyEight|access-date=February 17, 2017 |language=en-US}}</ref>\n\nEarly exit polls generally favored Clinton.<ref name=frankluntz/> After the polls closed and some of the results came in, the forecasts were found to be inaccurate, as Trump performed better in the competitive Midwestern states, such as [[Iowa]], [[Ohio]], and [[Minnesota]], than expected.

I, p. 4: At the same time that the IRA operation began to focus on supporting candidate Trump in early 2016, the Russian government employed a second form of interference: cyber intrusions (hacking) and releases of hacked materials damaging to the Clinton Campaign. The Russian intelligence service known as the Main Intelligence Directorate of the General Staff of the Russian Army (GRU) carried out these operations. In March 2016, the GRU began hacking the email accounts of Clinton Campaign volunteers and employees, including campaign chairman John Podesta. In April 2016, the GRU hacked into the computer networks of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee (DCCC) and the Democratic National Committee (DNC). The GRU stole hundreds of thousands of documents from the compromised email accounts and networks. Around the time that the DNC announced in mid-June 2016 the Russian government's role in hacking its network, the GRU began disseminating stolen materials through the fictitious online personas \"DCLeaks\" and \"Guccifer 2.0.\" The GRU later released additional materials through the organization WikiLeaks.</ref>\n\nTo establish whether a crime was committed by members of the Trump campaign with regard to Russian interference, the special counsel's investigators \"applied the framework of [[Conspiracy (criminal)|conspiracy law]]\", and not the concept of \"collusion\", because collusion \"is not a specific offense or theory of liability found in the United States Code, nor is it a term of art in federal criminal law.\"<ref>{{Cite web |last1=Morais |first1=Betsy |title=Collusion by any other name |url=https://www.cjr.org/first_person/trump-mueller-collusion.php |date=April 18, 2019 |work=[[Columbia Journalism Review]] |access-date=April 23, 2019}}</ref><ref>''[https://www.justice.gov/storage/report.pdf Mueller Report]'', vol. I, p. 2: In evaluating whether evidence about the collective action of multiple individuals constituted a crime, we applied the framework of conspiracy law, not the concept of \"collusion.\" In so doing, the Office recognized that the word \"collud[e]\" was used in communications with the Acting Attorney General confirming certain aspects of the investigation's scope and that the term has frequently been invoked in public reporting about the investigation. But collusion is not a specific offense or theory of liability found in the United States Code, nor is it a term of art in federal criminal law. For those reasons, the Office's focus in analyzing questions of joint criminal liability was on conspiracy as defined in federal law.</ref> They also investigated if members of the Trump campaign \"coordinated\" with Russia, using the definition of \"coordination\" as having \"an agreement\u2014tacit or express\u2014between the Trump campaign and the Russian government on election interference\". Investigators further elaborated that merely having \"two parties taking actions that were informed by or responsive to the other's actions or interests\" was not enough to establish coordination.<!-- ref name=NYTcompare/ --><ref>''[https://www.justice.gov/storage/report.pdf Mueller Report]'', vol.

Like collusion, \"coordination\" does not have a settled definition in federal criminal law. We understood coordination to require an agreement\u2014tacit or express\u2014between the Trump Campaign and the Russian government on election interference. That requires more than the two parties taking actions that were informed by or responsive to the other's actions or interests. We applied the term coordination in that sense when stating in the report that the investigation did not establish that the Trump campaign coordinated with the Russian government in its election interference activities.</ref>\n\nThe Mueller Report writes that the investigation \"identified numerous links between the Russian government and the Trump campaign\", found that Russia \"perceived it would benefit from a Trump presidency\" and that the 2016 Trump presidential campaign \"expected it would benefit electorally\" from Russian hacking efforts.

The study points out that since the 1980s, the advancement of technology has often led to a significant fraction of the workforce being worse off. Low skilled workers affected by [[Technological unemployment|technology driven job displacement]] had to replace their middle-income jobs with lower-income service jobs, or were pushed out of the workforce altogether, while the advancement of technology increased the demand for high-income jobs among skilled workers. Frey and his co-authors note a positive trend between automation driven income inequality and the movement toward [[political polarization]] in the United States. The study found a strong correlation between areas affected by technological automation and the increase of support for Donald Trump among low-skilled workers in the affected voting districts, concluding that:<blockquote>While the Computer Revolution has not rendered the workforce redundant, a large share of Americans have lost the race to technology, which is reflected in the reallocation of millions of workers from middle-income jobs to low-income occupations or non-employment as their jobs have been automated away{{nbsp}}... the victims of the Computer Revolution have a higher propensity to opt for radical political change: electoral districts with a higher share of jobs exposed to automation were significantly more likely to support Trump. The 2016 U.S. Presidential Election can thus be described as a riot against machines by democratic means.<ref>{{Cite web|last=Frey|first=Carl Benedikt|last2=Berger|first2=Thor|last3=Chen|first3=Chinchih|date=July 23, 2017|title=Political Machinery: Automation Anxiety and the 2016 U.S. Presidential Election|url=https://www.oxfordmartin.ox.ac.uk/downloads/academic/Political%20Machinery-Automation%20Anxiety%20and%20the%202016%20U_S_%20Presidential%20Election_230712.pdf}}</ref></blockquote>\n\n=== Candidates table ===\n\n<!-- This table is sorted by pledged electors first (that is, ignoring faithless electors), then by popular vote among candidates with 0 pledged electors. -->\n{{start U.S. presidential ticket box|pv_footnote=|ev_footnote=}}\n{{U.S. presidential ticket box rowspan|name=[[Donald Trump]]|party=[[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]]|state=[[New York (state)|New York]]|pv= 62,984,828 |pv_pct= 46.09% |ev-projected=306|ev=304 (306)|vp_count=1|vp_name=[[Mike Pence]]|vp_party=[[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]]|vp_state=[[Indiana]]|vp_ev=304}}\n{{U.S. presidential ticket box rowspan|name=[[Hillary Clinton]]|party=[[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]]|state=[[New York (state)|New York]]|pv= 65,853,514 |pv_pct= 48.18% |ev-projected=232|ev=227 (232)|vp_count=1|vp_name=[[Tim Kaine]]|vp_party=[[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]]|vp_state=[[Virginia]]|vp_ev=227}}\n{{U.S. presidential ticket box row|name=[[Gary Johnson]]| party=[[Libertarian Party (United States)|Libertarian]]| state=[[New Mexico]]| pv= 4,489,341 | pv_pct= 3.28% | ev-projected=0| ev=0| vp_name=[[Bill Weld]]| vp_party=[[Libertarian Party (United States)|Libertarian]]| vp_state=[[Massachusetts]]}}\n{{U.S. presidential ticket box row|name=[[Jill Stein]]| party=[[Green Party of the United States|Green]]| state=[[Massachusetts]]| pv= 1,457,218 | pv_pct= 1.07% | ev-projected=0| ev=0| vp_name=[[Ajamu Baraka]]| vp_party=[[Green Party (United States)|Green]]| vp_state=[[Illinois]]}}\n{{U.S. presidential ticket box row| name=[[Evan McMullin]]| party=[[Independent politician|Independent]]| state=[[Utah]]| pv= 731,991 | pv_pct= 0.54% | ev-projected=0| ev=0| vp_name=[[Mindy Finn]]| vp_party=[[Independent politician|Independent]]| vp_state=[[District of Columbia]]}}\n{{U.S. presidential ticket box row| name=[[Darrell Castle]]|| party=[[Constitution Party (United States)|Constitution]]| state=[[Tennessee]]| pv= 203,090 | pv_pct= 0.15% | ev-projected=0| ev=0| vp_name=[[Scott Bradley (politician)|Scott Bradley]]| vp_party=[[Constitution Party (United States)|Constitution]]| vp_state=[[Utah]]}}\n{{U.S. presidential ticket box rowspan| name=[[Bernie Sanders]]{{efn|name=faithless}}| party=[[Independent politician|Independent]]| state=[[Vermont]]| pv= 111,850 {{efn|name=write-in}}| pv_pct= 0.08% {{efn|name=write-in}}| ev-projected=0| ev=1 (0)| vp_count=1| vp_name=[[Elizabeth Warren]]{{efn|name=faithless}}|vp_party=[[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]]| vp_state=[[Massachusetts]]| vp_ev=1}}\n{{U.S. presidential ticket box row|name=[[Gloria La Riva]]|party=[[Party for Socialism and Liberation|Socialism and Liberation]]|state=[[California]]| pv= 74,401 | pv_pct= 0.05% | ev-projected=0| ev=0| vp_name=[[Eugene Puryear]]|vp_party=[[Party for Socialism and Liberation|Socialism and Liberation]]| vp_state=[[District of Columbia]]}}\n{{U.S. presidential ticket box rowspan| name=[[John Kasich]]{{efn|name=faithless}}{{efn|name=paul-kasich|Two faithless electors from Texas cast their presidential votes for Ron Paul and John Kasich, respectively.

However, FiveThirtyEight's model pointed to the possibility of an Electoral College-popular vote split widening in the final weeks based on Trump's improvement in swing states like Florida or Pennsylvania. This was due to the demographics targeted by Trump's campaign which lived in big numbers there, in addition to Clinton's poor performance in several of those swing states in comparison with Obama's performance in 2012, as well as having a big number of her potential voters in very populated traditionally 'blue' states, but also in some very populated states traditionally 'red', like Texas, which were projected safe for Trump.<ref>{{Cite news |url=http://fivethirtyeight.com/features/how-trump-could-win-the-white-house-while-losing-the-popular-vote/ |title=How Trump Could Win The White House While Losing The Popular Vote |last=Wasserman |first=David |date=September 15, 2016 |newspaper=FiveThirtyEight|access-date=February 17, 2017 |language=en-US}}</ref>\n\nEarly exit polls generally favored Clinton.<ref name=frankluntz/> After the polls closed and some of the results came in, the forecasts were found to be inaccurate, as Trump performed better in the competitive Midwestern states, such as [[Iowa]], [[Ohio]], and [[Minnesota]], than expected.

On 11 November the ''Medusa'' arrived in Nagasaki, and after Van Rees took overall command of the ships, the ''Djambi'' continued to Yokohama. Both ships were primarily meant to protect trade interests and Dutch citizens. \n\n===The Straits of Shimonoseki===\nOn 25 February 1864, [[Rutherford Alcock]] the British minister to Japan, arrived in Nagasaki on the warship ''Argus''. He had orders to open the Straits of Shimonoseki, which had been kept closed to foreign shipping by the [[Ch\u014dsh\u016b Domain|Ch\u014dsh\u016b clan]]. On 15 May both the ''Medusa'' and the ''Djambi'' were in Yokohama, waiting for the ''Metalen Kruis'' (which would arrive 28 June) and the steam paddle ship ''Amsterdam'' (which would arrive 4 July). On 20 May the British first rate ship of the line ''[[HMS Waterloo (1833)|Conqueror]]'' arrived with 588 marines. \n\nAfter this fleet had been assembled the forces of the United Kingdom, the Netherlands, France and the United States were brought under the command of English Vice-Admiral Kuper. In mid-July the English warships ''Barossa'' and ''Cormorant'' were sent to hand the Ch\u014dsh\u016b clan an ultimatum. The ''Djambi'' was to be part of this mission, but at the last moment this was changed. Instead a Dutch officer and a French officer were on board the English ships.<ref>{{Cite news |url=https://resolver.kb.nl/resolve?urn=ddd:000022144:mpeg21:p003 | work = Dagblad van Zuidholland en 's Gravenhage| title=Binnenland| lang=nl | date=1 October 1864}}</ref> After it became clear that the Ch\u014dsh\u016b would not give in to the ultimatum, military action was planned. Captain-lt van Rees of the ''Djambi'' was chosen to command the Dutch landing division of 240 sailors and marines. The English would land 1,400 men and the French 250. On 28 August the Dutch part of the fleet left Yokohama for the straits. The fleet was reassembled near the island of Himeshima in the evening of 3 September. On 4 September the fleet sailed the last stretch to Shimonoseki. The Dutch were in the right column, the English in the center, and the French on the left.<ref>{{Cite news |url=https://resolver.kb.nl/resolve?urn=ddd:010398554:mpeg21:p002 | work = Rotterdamsche courant| title=Japan| lang=nl | date=10 October 1864}}</ref>\n\nAt 4 PM on 5 September the Battle for the Shimonoseki Straits started. The ''Djambi'' was in the so-called heavy division consisting of the ''Tartar'', ''Dupleix'', ''Metalen Kruis'', ''Barossa'', ''Djambi'' and ''Leopard''. On the first day there was about 35 minutes of intense firing between the Japanese batteries and the fleet. The ''Djambi'' was the only ship in this division that did not suffer significant damage. She was hit in the hull 6 times, many times in the sails, and had a grenade exploding 6 meters above midships. One bullet made a hole in the hull, but the others were stopped by an improvised armor made of heavy chains that protected the battery.<ref>{{Cite news |url=https://resolver.kb.nl/resolve?urn=ddd:010484380:mpeg21:p005 | work = Java-bode| title=Japan| lang=nl | date=29 October 1864}}</ref> On the 5th the Djambi fired 54 shot from her 16 cm RML No3, 83 16 cm bullets and 1 regular 16 cm grenade. The 16 cm RML proved effective, but suffered much damage from firing. \n\nOn 6 September the ''Djambi'' would engage the main Japanese battery again, and fired 4 shot from the rifled guns. That day the ''Djambi'' landed troops that took the battery of Mozi-Saki together with the French. Commander van Rees also landed and tried to embark the guns, but he only succeeded in embarking a 12-pounder. On the 7th the ''Djambi'', ''Tartar'', ''Dupleix'' and ''Metalen Kruis'' were first to enter the straits. On the 8th they reached the small island Hikoshima. They fired at the fortifications, landed and took 16 guns. These were brought on board shortly after, the ''Djambi'' taking 5 bronze guns. The most junior officer of the ''Djambi'' would later report these to be two 30-pounders, One 24-pounder and two 12-pounders.<ref>{{Cite news |url=https://resolver.kb.nl/resolve?urn=MMKB08:000114919:mpeg21:p001| work = Delftsche courant| title=Binnenlandsche Berigten| lang=nl | date=18 November 1864}}</ref> The report by Captain Van Rees would be published in Casembroot's work.

On 23 April she arrived in Singapore, and on 28 April she arrived back in Batavia. \n\n===Cruises on the Java Sea===\nIn the summer of 1869 the ''Djambi'' started on two cruising trips for exercise and fighting piracy. The first lasted from 6 July till the 21st, when she arrived back in Batavia from the east. On 1 August the ''Djambi'' left Batavia for a second cruise on the Java Sea. The first destination would be Samarang. On 16 August she arrived in [[Banyuwangi (town)|Banyuwangi]] on Java, from whence she left on 24 August. On 4 September she left from Samarang. On the 12th she left [[Cirebon]], arriving back in Batavia on 14 September. At about this time Buys was promoted to the rank of captain. \n\n===Stationary service===\nBy 15 October 1869 the ''Djambi'' was serving as \"Wachtship\" in Batavia, but on 4 December she left Batavia for Cirebon. By 15 December she was \"stationed\" there, meaning it would be her base. On 12 March 1870 the ''Djambi'' arrived in Samarang under Commander J.H.K. Croes. On 16 March the ''Djambi'' left Samarang under Captain-lt Croes, she arrived in Batavia on 18 March. On 5 April she arrived in Samarang from Cirebon, leaving there on the 11th, and arriving in Batavia on the 15th. In June the ''Djambi'' was in the [[Alor Strait]] together with the steam corvette ''Willem''. On 22 July 1870 the ''Willem'', ''Aart van Nes'' and ''Djambi'' left for Madjene (Celebes) to remind the sultan he had to offer his respects in [[Makassar]]. From Makassar the ''Djambi'' continued to Borneo, and in October she was in Batavia. On 19 December 1870 she left Batavia for Samarang.\n\nIn March 1871 the ''Djambi'' was in Batavia. Together with the steam corvettes ''Curacao'' and ''Willem'', the sloop ''Marnix'', and the paddle steamers ''Sumatra'' and ''Amsterdam'' she would have to impress the king of Thailand during his visit.<ref>{{Cite news |url=https://resolver.kb.nl/resolve?urn=KBDDD02:000202661:mpeg21:p002 | work = De Locomotief| title=Gemengde Indische Berichten| lang=nl | date=13 March 1871}}</ref> On 13 April 1871 Captain-lt J.H.K.

On 14 May 1872 the Djambi sailed to Aceh again under commander T. van der Veld Erdbrink.

The Dutch assembled a relatively large force of 6 warships (''Djambi'', ''Citadel van Antwerpen'', ''Marnix'', ''Surabaya'', ''Sumatra'' and ''Coehoorn''), and about 3,000 men. The ''Djambi'' was the strongest of these ships, and was to become the flagship. She was ordered by telegraph to sail straight from Riouw to Aceh, meeting the expedition before [[Banda Aceh]]. On 5 April 1873 all ships came before Banda Aceh. The ''Djambi'' opened fire on some fortifications on the right side of the river. The expedition quickly turned into a failure. The dismal state of the fleet, was one of the causes. It was doubtful whether the fleet would be able to maintain communications once the monsoon arrived. The boilers of the ''Djambi'', ''Marnix'' and ''Coehoorn'' were so bad that were not steam ready, and could not use their distilling machines all the time. Therefore they might have got beached in bad weather.<ref>{{Cite news |url=https://resolver.kb.nl/resolve?urn=ddd:010486652:mpeg21:p002 | work = Java-bode| title=Een toelichtend woord vooraf| lang=nl | date=30 December 1873}}</ref> There were days that the ''Djambi'' was not at all able to use her engine, and when she could, she did not go faster than 3 knots.<ref>{{Cite news |url=https://resolver.kb.nl/resolve?urn=ddd:010486562:mpeg21:p003 | work = Java Bode| title=De interprellatie Nierstrasz| lang=nl | date=16 May 1873}}</ref> On 21 May 1873 the ''Djambi'' arrived back in Batavia.\n\n==Final Voyage==\nOn 15 July the ''Djambi'' was being prepared for her home voyage at Onrust. On 6 August 1873 the ''Djambi'' under Captain Koopman left Batavia for the Netherlands. In early September the ''Djambi'' ran into a violent storm that lasted for 7 days east of the [[Cape of Good Hope]]. She had some damage, primarily in the rigging, and therefore anchored in [[Port Elizabeth]] on 10 September. She would continue her trip on the 15th.<ref>{{Cite news |url=https://resolver.kb.nl/resolve?urn=MMKB08:000149313:mpeg21:p005 | work = Nederlandsche staatscourant| title=Binnenlandsche Berigten| lang=nl | date=27 October 1873}}</ref> On 21 September the Djambi indeed arrived in [[Simon's Town]], being joined there by the Marnix under Captain-lt Rietveld on the 22nd.<ref>{{Cite news |url=https://resolver.kb.nl/resolve?urn=MMKB08:000149319:mpeg21:p004| work = Nederlandsche staatscourant| title=Binnenlandsche Berigten| lang=nl | date=31 October 1873}}</ref> The Marnix would continue to the Netherlands on 4 October.

This was a technical disappointment as well as a political setback. The ''Djambi'' was 13 years old at the time, much too young to be decommissioned for technical reasons. In a political sense decommissioning the ''Djambi'' provided ammunition to those who had all along stated that the navy in the Indies had been neglected. In late November rumors that the transport ship ''Java'' was being prepared to retrieve the men and inventory of the Djambi \"declared unfit\" at the Cape surfaced in the media.<ref>{{Cite news |url=https://resolver.kb.nl/resolve?urn=MMHCO01:000066692:mpeg21:p002| work = Provinciale Overijsselsche en Zwolsche courant| title=Binnenland| lang=nl | date=25 November 1873}}</ref> On 11 December the secretary for the navy said in the lower house that what happened to the ''Djambi'' was a real pity. That he was surprised when he got the first report by the commander, but that at that moment it was supposed that the ship could be repaired at relatively low cost. On 18 December he declared that in October 1872 he got a message that the hull of the ''Djambi'' was satisfactory, and the boilers could still last a year.<ref>{{Cite news |url=https://resolver.kb.nl/resolve?urn=MMKB08:000090778:mpeg21:p003| work = Arnhemsche courant| title=Staten Generaal| lang=nl | date=20 December 1873}}</ref>\n\nIn December 1873 the steam corvette ''[[HMS Challenger (1858)|Challenger]]'' of the Challenger expedition visited Cape Town. The officers of the ''Djambi'' were invited to the ball at the governor's house. On 13 February 46 officers and men of the ''Djambi'' arrived in Hellevoetsluis via London. On 19 February the ''Djambi'' fired a salute to commemorate the birthday of the Dutch king, the salute was answered by the English ''Flora''. On 1 January 1874 the transport ship ''Java'' had been commissioned. On 27 January she had left Texel for the Cape, arriving there on 23 March. On 12 April the ''Java'' left again for home.

Both ships were primarily meant to protect trade interests and Dutch citizens. \n\n===The Straits of Shimonoseki===\nOn 25 February 1864, [[Rutherford Alcock]] the British minister to Japan, arrived in Nagasaki on the warship ''Argus''. He had orders to open the Straits of Shimonoseki, which had been kept closed to foreign shipping by the [[Ch\u014dsh\u016b Domain|Ch\u014dsh\u016b clan]]. On 15 May both the ''Medusa'' and the ''Djambi'' were in Yokohama, waiting for the ''Metalen Kruis'' (which would arrive 28 June) and the steam paddle ship ''Amsterdam'' (which would arrive 4 July). On 20 May the British first rate ship of the line ''[[HMS Waterloo (1833)|Conqueror]]'' arrived with 588 marines. \n\nAfter this fleet had been assembled the forces of the United Kingdom, the Netherlands, France and the United States were brought under the command of English Vice-Admiral Kuper.

The ''Djambi'' was to be part of this mission, but at the last moment this was changed.

On the first day there was about 35 minutes of intense firing between the Japanese batteries and the fleet. The ''Djambi'' was the only ship in this division that did not suffer significant damage. She was hit in the hull 6 times, many times in the sails, and had a grenade exploding 6 meters above midships. One bullet made a hole in the hull, but the others were stopped by an improvised armor made of heavy chains that protected the battery.<ref>{{Cite news |url=https://resolver.kb.nl/resolve?urn=ddd:010484380:mpeg21:p005 | work = Java-bode| title=Japan| lang=nl | date=29 October 1864}}</ref> On the 5th the Djambi fired 54 shot from here 16 cm RML No3, 83 16 cm bullets and 1 regular 16 cm grenade. The 16 cm RML proved effective, but suffered much damage from firing. \n\nOn 6 September the ''Djambi'' would engage the main Japanese battery again, and fired 4 shot from the rifled guns. That day the ''Djambi'' landed troops that took the battery of Mozi-Saki together with the French. Commander van Rees also landed and tried to embark the guns, but he only succeeded in embarking a 12-pounder. On the 7th the ''Djambi'', ''Tartar'', ''Dupleix'' and ''Metalen Kruis'' were first to enter the straits. On the 8th they reached the small island Hikoshima. They fired at the fortifications, landed and took 16 guns. These were brought on board shortly after, the ''Djambi'' taking 5 bronze guns. The most junior officer of the ''Djambi'' would later report these to be two 30-pounders, One 24-pounder and two 12-pounders.<ref>{{Cite news |url=https://resolver.kb.nl/resolve?urn=MMKB08:000114919:mpeg21:p001| work = Delftsche courant| title=Binnenlandsche Berigten| lang=nl | date=18 November 1864}}</ref> The report by Captain Van Rees would be published in Casembroot's work.

The Dutch assembled a relatively large force of 6 warships (''Djambi'', ''Citadel van Antwerpen'', ''Marnix'', ''Surabaya'', ''Sumatra'' and ''Coehoorn''), and about 3,000 men. The ''Djambi'' was the strongest of these ships, and was to become the flagship. She was ordered by telegraph to sail straight from Riouw to Aceh, meeting the expedition before [[Banda Aceh]]. On 5 April 1873 all ships came before Banda Aceh. The ''Djambi'' opened fire on some fortifications on the right side of the river. The expedition quickly turned into a failure. The dismal state of the fleet, was one of the causes. It was doubtful whether the fleet would be able to maintain communications once the monsoon arrived. The boilers of the ''Djambi'', ''Marnix'' and ''Coehoorn'' were so bad that were not steam ready, and could not use their distilling machines all the time. Therefore they might have got beached in bad weather.<ref>{{Cite news |url=https://resolver.kb.nl/resolve?urn=ddd:010486652:mpeg21:p002 | work = Java-bode| title=Een toelichtend woord vooraf| lang=nl | date=30 December 1873}}</ref> There were days that the ''Djambi'' was not at all able to use her engine, and when she could, she did not go faster than 3 knots.<ref>{{Cite news |url=https://resolver.kb.nl/resolve?urn=ddd:010486562:mpeg21:p003 | work = Java Bode| title=De interprellatie Nierstrasz| lang=nl | date=16 May 1873}}</ref> On 21 May 1873 the ''Djambi'' arrived back in Batavia.\n\n==Final Voyage==\nOn 15 July the ''Djambi'' was being prepared for her home voyage at Onrust. On 6 August 1873 the ''Djambi'' under Captain Koopman left Batavia for the Netherlands. In early September the ''Djambi'' ran into a violent storm that lasted for 7 days east of the [[Cape of Good Hope]]. She had some damage, primarily in the rigging, and therefore anchored in [[Port Elizabeth]] on 10 September. She would continue her trip on the 15th.<ref>{{Cite news |url=https://resolver.kb.nl/resolve?urn=MMKB08:000149313:mpeg21:p005 | work = Nederlandsche staatscourant| title=Binnenlandsche Berigten| lang=nl | date=27 October 1873}}</ref> On 21 September the Djambi indeed arrived in [[Simon's Town]], being joined there by the Marnix under Captain-lt Rietveld on the 22nd.<ref>{{Cite news |url=https://resolver.kb.nl/resolve?urn=MMKB08:000149319:mpeg21:p004| work = Nederlandsche staatscourant| title=Binnenlandsche Berigten| lang=nl | date=31 October 1873}}</ref> The Marnix would continue to the Netherlands on 4 October.

This was a technical disappointment as well as a political setback. The ''Djambi'' was 13 years old at the time, much too young to be decommissioned for technical reasons. In a political sense decommissioning the ''Djambi'' provided ammunition to those who had all along stated that the navy in the Indies had been neglected. In late November rumors that the transport ship ''Java'' was being prepared to retrieve the men and inventory of the Djambi \"declared unfit\" at the Cape surfaced in the media.<ref>{{Cite news |url=https://resolver.kb.nl/resolve?urn=MMHCO01:000066692:mpeg21:p002| work = Provinciale Overijsselsche en Zwolsche courant| title=Binnenland| lang=nl | date=25 November 1873}}</ref> On 11 December the secretary for the navy said in the lower house that what happened to the ''Djambi'' was a real pity. That he was surprised when he got the first report by the commander, but that at that moment it was supposed that the ship could be repaired at relatively low cost. On 18 December he declared that in October 1872 he got a message that the hull of the ''Djambi'' was satisfactory, and the boilers could still last a year.<ref>{{Cite news |url=https://resolver.kb.nl/resolve?urn=MMKB08:000090778:mpeg21:p003| work = Arnhemsche courant| title=Staten Generaal| lang=nl | date=20 December 1873}}</ref>\n\nIn December 1873 the steam corvette ''[[HMS Challenger (1858)|Challenger]]'' of the Challenger expedition visited Cape Town. The officers of the ''Djambi'' were invited to the ball at the governor's house. On 13 February 46 officers and men of the ''Djambi'' arrived in Hellevoetsluis via London. On 19 February the ''Djambi'' fired a salute to commemorate the birthday of the Dutch king, the salute was answered by the English ''Flora''. On 1 January 1874 the transport ship ''Java'' had been commissioned. On 27 January she had left Texel for the Cape, arriving there on 23 March. On 12 April the ''Java'' left again for home.

They also include one or more methods for importing [[content (media)|content]] to bring new items under management and several presentation methods to make items available for use.\n\nWhile it is possible that content in an ECM is protected by [[Digital rights management|DRM]] it is not required.\n\nThe key feature of ECM that distinguishes it from \"simple\" content management is that an ECM is at least cognizant of the processes and procedures of the enterprise it is created for, and as such is particular to it.<ref name=\"AIIM whatis\">{{Cite web\n  | url = https://www.opentext.com/products-and-solutions/products/enterprise-content-management\n  | title = What is Enterprise Content Management (ECM)?\n  | work = OPENTEXT\n  | publisher = OPENTEXT\n  | accessdate = September 20, 2010 }}</ref>\n\n==Definition==\n; Late 2005:\n:''Enterprise content management is the technology used to capture, manage, store, preserve, and deliver content and documents related to organizational processes.''\n; Early 2006:\n:''Enterprise content management is the technology used to capture, manage, store, preserve, and deliver content and documents related to organizational processes.''\n:''ECM tools and strategies allow the management of an organization's [[unstructured information]], wherever that information exists.''\n; Early 2008:\n:''Enterprise Content Management (ECM) is the [[strategy | strategies]], methods, and tools used to capture, manage, store, preserve, and deliver content and documents related to organizational processes.

IIM is defined as ''the strategies, methods, and tools used to create, capture, automate, deliver, secure, and analyze content and documents related to organizational processes. IIM refers to the management of content AND data, not just content itself.''<ref>{{cite web|last1=Mancini|first1=John|title=The Next Wave: Moving from ECM to Intelligent Information Management|url=https://cdn2.hubspot.net/hubfs/332414/AIIM_Blog/Intel-info-Next-Wave-2017-updated.pdf|website=AIIM|publisher=AIIM}}</ref>\nThe latest definition encompasses areas that have traditionally been addressed by [[records management]] and by [[document management]] systems. It also implies the conversion of data between various digital and traditional forms, including paper and microfilm.\n\nECM as an [[umbrella term]] covers [[document management]], [[Web content management]], search, collaboration, [[records management]], [[digital asset management]] (DAM), [[workflow management system| workflow management]], [[Optical character recognition|capture and scanning]]. ECM is primarily aimed{{by whom?|date=August 2017}} at managing the life-cycle of information from initial publication or creation all the way through archival and eventual disposal. ECM applications are delivered{{by whom?|date=August 2017}} in four ways: \n\n* on-premises software (installed on an organization's own network)\n* [[software as a service]] (SaaS) (Web access to information that is stored on a software manufacturer's system) \n* a hybrid composed of both on-premises and SaaS components\n* [[Cloud computing|Infrastructure as a Service]] (IaaS) (which refers to online services that abstract the user from the details of infrastructure like physical computing resources, location, data partitioning, scaling, security, backup etc.)\n\nECM aims to make the management of corporate information easier through simplifying storage, security, version control, process routing, and retention.{{cn|date=August 2017}} The benefits to an organization include improved efficiency, better control, and reduced costs. For example, many banks have converted to storing copies of old cheques within ECM systems ('''ECMS'''s)  as opposed to the older method of keeping physical cheques in massive paper warehouses. Under the old system, a customer request for a copy of a cheque might take weeks, as the bank employees had to contact the warehouse where the right box, file, and cheque, would need to be located. The cheque would then need to be pulled, a copy made and mailed to the bank where it would finally be mailed to the customer. With a suitable ECM system in place, the bank employee might simply query the system for the customer\u2019s account number and the number of the requested cheque. When the image of the cheque appears on-screen, the bank can mail a copy immediately to the customer, usually while the customer is still on the phone.\n\n==Scope==\nEnterprise content management, as a form of [[content management]], combines the capture, search and networking of documents with [[digital archiving]], document management and [[workflow]]. It specifically includes the special challenges involved in using and preserving a company's internal, often unstructured information, in all of its forms. Therefore, most ECM solutions focus on [[business-to-employee]] (B2E) systems.\n\nAs ECM solutions have evolved, new components have emerged. For example, as content is checked in and out, each use generates new [[metadata]] about the content, to some extent automatically; information about how and when people use the content can allow the system to gradually acquire new filtering, routing and search pathways, [[corporate taxonomies]] and [[semantic network]]s, and retention-rule decisions. [[Email]] and [[instant messaging]] feature increasingly in decision-making processes; ECM can provide access to data about these communications, which can be used{{by whom|date=January 2016}} in business decisions.\n\nSolutions can provide [[intranet]] services to employees (B2E), and can also include [[enterprise portal]]s for [[business-to-business]] (B2B), [[business-to-government]] (B2G), [[government-to-business]] (G2B), or other business relationships. This category includes most former document-management [[groupware]] and workflow solutions that have not {{as of | 2016 | alt = yet}} fully converted their architecture to ECM, but provide a Web interface. Digital asset management is a form of ECM concerned with content stored using digital technology.\n\n==History==\nThe technologies that comprise ECM {{as of | 2016 | lc = on}} descend from the electronic [[document management system]]s (EDMS) of the late 1980s and early 1990s. The original EDMS products were stand-alone products, providing functionality in one of four areas: [[Document imaging|imaging]], workflow, document management, or [[Enterprise relationship management|ERM]] (see [[#Components|components]] below).\n\nThe typical early EDMS adopter deployed a small-scale imaging and workflow system, possibly to just a single department, in order to improve a paper-intensive process and to migrate towards the mythical [[paperless office]]. The first stand-alone EDMS technologies aimed to save time or to improve information access by reducing paper handling and paper storage, thereby reducing document loss and providing faster access to information. EDMS could provide online access to information formerly available only on paper, microfilm, or microfiche. By improving control over documents and document-oriented processes, EDMS streamlined time-consuming business practices. The audit trail generated by EDMS enhanced document security and provided metrics to help measure productivity and identify efficiencies.\n\nThrough the late 1990s, the EDMS industry continued to grow steadily.{{citation needed|date=January 2016}}\n\nAs more organizations achieved \"pockets\" of productivity with these technologies, it became clear that the various EDMS product categories were complementary. Organizations increasingly wanted to leverage multiple EDMS products. Consider, for example, a customer-service department\u2014where imaging, document management, and workflow could combine to allow agents to better resolve customer inquiries. Likewise, an accounting department might access supplier invoices from an ERM system, purchase orders from an imaging system, and contracts from a document management system as part of an approval workflow. As organizations established an [[Internet]] presence, they wanted to present information via the Web, which required managing Web content. Organizations that had automated individual departments now began to envision wider benefits from broader deployment. Many documents across multiple departments and affect multiple processes.\n\nThe movement toward integrated EDM systems merely reflected a common trend in the software industry: the ongoing integration of point systems into more comprehensive systems. For example, until the early 1990s, word processing, spreadsheet, and presentation software products were standalone products. Thereafter, the market shifted toward integration.\n\nEarly leaders already offered multiple stand-alone EDMS technologies. The first phase was to offer multiple systems as a single, packaged \"suite\", with little or no functional integration. Throughout the 1990s, integration increased.{{citation needed|date=January 2016}} Beginning in approximately 2001, the industry began to use the term ''enterprise content management'' to refer to these integrated systems.\n\nIn 2006, [[Microsoft]] (with its [[SharePoint]] product family) and [[Oracle Corporation]] (with [[Oracle Content Management]]) joined also entered the entry-level \"value\" market segment of ECM.<ref>\nMicrosoft launched its ECM strategy with MOSS 2007; Oracle, with Oracle 10g and the acquisition of Stellent, both in late 2006.</ref><ref>\n''Evolving Electronic Document Management Solutions: The Doculabs Report'', Third Edition. Chicago: Doculabs, 2002.</ref>\n\n[[Open source]] ECM products are also available.\n\nGovernment standards, including [[HIPAA]], [[Statement on Auditing Standards No. 70: Service Organizations|SAS 70]], [[BS 7799]] and [[ISO/IEC 27001]], influence the development and deployment of ECM. Standards compliance may make [[outsourcing]] to certified service providers a viable alternative to an internal ECM deployment.{{original research inline|date=January 2016}}\n\n{{As of | 2016}} organizations can deploy a single, flexible ECM system to manage information in all functional departments, including customer service, accounting, human resources, etc.\n\n==Adoption drivers==\nThere are numerous factors driving businesses to adopt an ECM solution, such as the need to increase efficiency, improving control of information, and reducing the [[Overall|overall cost]] of information management for the enterprise. ECM applications streamline access to records through keyword and full-text search allowing employees to get to the information they need directly from their desktops in seconds rather than searching multiple applications or digging through paper records.\n\nThese management systems can enhance record control to help businesses to comply with government and industry regulations such as HIPAA, [[Sarbanes-Oxley]], [[PCI DSS]], and the [[Federal Rules of Civil Procedure]]. Security functions including user-level, function-level, and even record-specific security options protect your most sensitive data. In fact, even information contained on a specific document can be masked using redaction features, so the rest of the document can be shared without compromising individual identity or key data. Every action taken within the system is tracked and reportable for auditing purposes for a wide variety of regulations.\n\nECM systems can reduce storage, paper and mailing needs, make employees more efficient, and result in better, more informed decisions across the enterprise\u2014all of which reduce the overhead costs of managing information. SaaS ECM services can convert expensive capital outlay for servers and network equipment into a monthly operating expense, while also reducing the IT resources required to manage enterprise records.\n\n==Characteristics==\nContent management includes ECM, Web content management (WCM), content syndication, and media asset management. Enterprise content management is not a closed-system solution or a distinct product category. Therefore, along with Document Related Technologies or Document Lifecycle Management, ECM is just one possible catch-all term for a wide range of technologies and vendors.\n\nThe content and structure of today's outward-directed [[Web portal]] will be the platform for tomorrow's internal information system. In his article in ''Computerwoche'',<ref>\nUlrich Kampffmeyer, \"ECM \u2014 Herrscher \u00fcber Information\". Computerwoche, CW-exktraKT, Munich, September 24th, 2001.</ref> Ulrich Kampffmeyer distilled ECM to three key ideas that distinguish such solutions from Web content management:\n\n<blockquote>\n; Enterprise content management as integrative middleware\n: ECM is used to overcome the restrictions of former vertical applications and island architectures. The user is basically unaware of using an ECM solution. ECM offers the requisite infrastructure for the new world of Web-based IT, which is establishing itself as a kind of third platform alongside conventional host and client/server systems. Therefore, EAI ([[enterprise application integration]]) and SOA ([[service-oriented architecture]]) will play an important role in the implementation and use of ECM.\n; Enterprise content management components as independent services\n: ECM is used to manage information without regard to the source or the required use. The functionality is provided as a service that can be used from all kinds of applications. The advantage of a service concept is that for any given functionality only one general service is available, thus avoiding redundant, expensive and difficult to maintain parallel functions. Therefore, standards for interfaces connecting different services will play an important role in the implementation of ECM.''\n; Enterprise content management as a uniform repository for all types of information\n: ECM is used as a content warehouse (both [[data warehouse]] and document warehouse) that combines company information in a repository with a uniform structure. Expensive redundancies and associated problems with [[information consistency]] are eliminated. All applications deliver their content to a single repository, which in turn provides needed information to all applications. Therefore, content integration and ILM ([[Information Lifecycle Management]]) will play an important role in the implementation and use of ECM.\n\nEnterprise content management is working properly when it is effectively \"invisible\" to users. ECM technologies are infrastructures that support specialized applications as subordinate services.\n\nECM thus is a collection of infrastructure components that fit into a multi-layer model and include all document related technologies (DRT) for handling, delivering, and managing structured data and unstructured information jointly. As such, enterprise content management is one of the necessary basic components of the overarching e-business application area. ECM also sets out to manage all the information of a WCM and covers archiving needs as a universal repository.<ref name=\"SER-ECM-whitepaper\"/></blockquote>\n\n==Components==\nECM combines components that can also be used as stand-alone systems without being incorporated into an enterprise-wide system.<ref name=\"SER-ECM-whitepaper\">\n''Trends in Records, Document and Enterprise Content Management''.

Capture is also used to collect electronic files and information into a consistent structure for management. Capture technologies also encompass the creation of metadata (index values) that describe characteristics of a document for easy location through search technology. For example, a medical chart might include the patient ID, patient name, date of visit, and procedure as index values to make it easy for medical personnel to locate the chart.\n\nEarlier [[document automation]] systems photographed documents for storage on [[microfilm]] or [[microfiche]]. [[Optical scanner]]s now make digital copies of paper documents. Documents already in digital form can be copied or linked to, if they are already available online.\n\nAutomatic or semi-automatic capture can use [[Electronic Data Interchange|EDI]] or [[XML]] documents, business and [[Enterprise resource planning|ERP]] applications or existing specialist application systems as sources.\n\n====Recognition technologies====\nVarious recognition technologies can be used to extract information from [[Image scanning|scanned]] documents and digital [[fax]]es, including:\n\n;[[Optical character recognition]] (OCR)\n:Converts images of typeset text into alphanumeric characters\n;[[Handwriting recognition|handprint character recognition]] (HCR)\n:Converts images of handwritten text into alphanumerics. Gives better results for short text in fixed locations than for freeform text.\n;[[Intelligent character recognition]] (ICR)\n:Extends OCR and HCR to use a comparison, logical connections, and checks against reference lists and existing master data to improve recognition. For example, on a form where a column of numbers is added up, the accuracy of the recognition can be checked by adding the recognized numbers and comparing them to the sum written on the original form.\n;[[Optical mark recognition]] (OMR)\n:Reads special markings, such as checkmarks or dots, in predefined fields.\n;[[Barcode]] recognition\n:Decodes industry-standard encodings of product and other commercial data.\n\n====Image cleanup====\nImage cleanup features include rotation, straightening, color adjustment, transposition, zoom, aligning, page separation, annotations and despeckling.\n\n====Forms processing====\nIn forms capture, there are two groups of technologies, although the information content and character of the documents may be identical. ''Forms processing'' is the capture of printed forms via scanning; recognition technologies are often used here since well-designed forms enable largely automatic processing. ''Automatic processing'' can be used to capture electronic forms, such as those submitted via Web pages, as long as the layout, structure, logic, and contents are known to the capture system.\n\n====COLD====\n[[Computer Output to Laser Disc]] (COLD) records reports and other documents on optical disks, or any form of digital storage for ongoing management by ECM systems. Another term for this is [[enterprise report management]] (ERM). Originally, the technology only worked with [[laserdisc]]s; the name was not changed after other technologies supplanted the laserdisc.\n\n====Aggregation====\n[[Data aggregation|Aggregation]] combines documents from different applications. The goal is to unify data from different sources, forwarding them to storage and processing systems in a uniform structure and format.\n\n====Indexing components====\n[[Subject indexing|Indexing]] improves searches, and provides alternative ways to organize the information.\n\nManual indexing assigns index database attributes to content by hand, typically used by the database of a \"manage\" component for administration and access. Manual indexing may make use of ''input designs'' to limit the information that can be entered; for example, entry masks may use program logic to restrict inputs based on other information known about the document.\n\nBoth automatic and manual attribute indexing can be made easier and better with preset input-design profiles; these can describe document classes that limit the number of possible index values, or automatically assign certain criteria.\n\nAutomatic classification programs can extract index, category, and transfer data autonomously. Automatic classification or categorizing, based on the information contained in electronic information objects, can evaluate information based on predefined criteria or in a self-learning process. This technique can be used with OCR-converted faxes, office files, or output files.\n\n===Manage===\nThe '''Manage''' category includes five traditional application areas:\n\n* Document management (DM)\n* [[Collaboration]] (or collaborative software, a.k.a. groupware)\n* Web content management (including Web portals)\n* Records management\n* Workflow and [[business process management]] (BPM)\n\nThe Manage category connects the other components, which can be used in combination or separately. Document management, Web content management, collaboration, workflow and business process management address the dynamic part of the information's lifecycle. Records management focuses on managing finalized documents in accordance with the organization's [[retention period|document retention]] policy, which in turn must comply with government mandates and industry practices.\n\nAll Manage components incorporate [[database]]s and access authorization systems.\nManage components are offered individually or integrated as suites. In many cases they already include the \"store\" components.\n\n====Document management====\n<!--\n[[:de:image:ECM Document Management.jpg|ECM: Document Management. Source: AIIM / PROJECT CONSULT 2003]]\n-->\n{{Main article|Document management system}}\nDocument management, in this context, refers to document management systems in the narrow sense of controlling documents from creation to archiving. Document management includes functions like:\n\n;Check in/check out\n:For checking stored information for consistency\n;Version management\n:To keep track of different versions of the same information with revisions and renditions (same information in a different format)\n;Search and navigation\n:For finding information and its associated contexts\n;Organizing documents\n:In structures like files, folders, and overviews\n\nHowever, document management increasingly overlaps with other \"Manage\" components, office applications like Microsoft Outlook and Exchange, or [[Lotus Notes]] and Domino, as well as \"library services\" for administering information storage.\n\n====Collaboration {{Anchor|Collaboration (collaborative systems, groupware)}}====\n<!--\n[[:de:image:ECM Collaboration.jpg|ECM: Collaboration. Source: AIIM / PROJECT CONSULT 2003]]\n-->\nCollaboration components in an ECM system help users work with each other to develop and process content. Many of these components were developed from [[collaborative software]], or ''groupware'', packages; ECM collaborative systems go much further, and include elements of [[knowledge management]].\n\nECM systems facilitate collaboration by using information databases and processing methods that are designed to be used simultaneously by multiple users, even when those users are working on the same content item. They make use of knowledge based on skills, resources and background data for joint information processing. Administration components, such as virtual whiteboards for brainstorming, appointment scheduling, and project management systems, communications application such as video conferencing, etc., may be included.\n\nCollaborative ECM may also integrate information from other applications, permitting joint information processing.\n\n====Web content management====\n<!--\n[[:de:bild:ECM Web Content Management.jpg|ECM-Komponenten: Web Content Management. Source: AIIM / PROJECT CONSULT 2003]]\n-->\nThe scope of Enterprise content management integrates [[Web content management system]]s. WCM as ECM component is used to present information already existing and managed in the ECM repository.<ref>Ulrich Kampffmeyer, Enterprise Content Management, 2006, [http://www.project-consult.de/files/ECM_Enterprise_Content_Management_eBook_Ulrich_Kampffmeyer_2006.pdf PDF]</ref> However, information presented via Web technologies\u2014on the Internet, an [[extranet]], or on a portal\u2014uses the workflow, access control, versioning, delivery and authorization modules of the WCM instead of integrated ECM functionality. There are only few examples of successful implementations whereby a shared repository for documents and Web content are managed together.{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}}\n\n====Records management (file and archive management)====\n<!--\n[[:de:Bild:ECM Records Management.jpg|ECM: Records Management. Source: AIIM / PROJECT CONSULT 2003]]\n-->\nUnlike traditional electronic archival systems, records management refers to the pure administration of records, important information, and data that companies are required to archive. Records management is independent of storage media; managed information does not necessarily need to be stored electronically, but can be on traditional physical media as well. Some of the functions of records management are:\n\n* Visualization of file plans and other structured indexes for the orderly storage of information\n* Unambiguous indexing of information, supported by thesauri or controlled wordlists\n* Management of record retention schedules and deletion schedules\n* Protection of information in accordance with its characteristics, sometimes down to individual content components in documents\n* Use of international, industry-specific or company-wide standardized metadata for the unambiguous identification and description of stored information\n\n====Workflow/business process management====\n<!--\n[[:de:Bild:ECM Workflow.jpg|ECM-Komponenten: Workflow / Business Process Management. Source: AIIM / PROJECT CONSULT 2003]]\n-->\nWorkflow and business process management differ substantially.\n\n=====Workflow=====\nThere are different types of workflow: ''production workflow'' uses predefined sequences to guide and control processes, whereas in an ''ad-hoc workflow'', the user determines the process sequence on the fly.\n\nWorkflow can be implemented as ''workflow solutions'' with which users interact, or as ''workflow engines'', which act as a background service controlling the information and data flow.\n\nWorkflow management includes the following functions:\n\n* Visualization of process and organization structures\n* Capture, administration, visualization, and delivery of grouped information with its associated documents or data\n* Incorporation of data processing tools (such as specific applications) and documents (such as office products)\n* Parallel and sequential processing of procedures including simultaneous saving\n* Reminders, deadlines, delegation and other administration functionalities\n* Monitoring and documentation of process status, routing, and outcomes\n* Tools for designing and displaying process\n\nThe objective is to automate processes as much as possible by incorporating all necessary resources.\n\n=====Business process management=====\nDefinition cited from AIIM:\n''BPM is a way of looking at and then controlling the processes that are present in an organization. It is an effective methodology to use in times of crisis to make certain that the processes are efficient and effective, as this will result in a better and more cost efficient organization.\n''\n''Business process management'' (BPM) goes a step further than workflow. Although the words are often used interchangeably, BPM aims to completely integrate all of the affected applications within an enterprise, monitoring processes and assembling all required information. Among BPM's functions are:\n\nBPM offers complete workflow functionality, providing process and data monitoring at the server level. Enterprise application integration is used to link different applications. [[Business intelligence]], with rule structures, integrates information warehouses and provides utilities that assist users in their work.\n\n===Store===\nStore components temporarily store information that isn't required, desired, or ready for long-term storage or preservation. Even if the Store component uses media that are suitable for long-term archiving, \"Store\" is still separate from \"Preserve.\"\n\nThe Store components can be divided into three categories: '''Repositories''' as storage locations, '''Library Services''' as administration components for repositories, and storage '''Technologies'''. These infrastructure components are sometimes held at the operating system level (like the [[file system]]), and also include security technologies that work in tandem with the \"Deliver\" components. However, security technologies, including access control, are superordinated components of an ECM solution.\n\n====Repositories====\nDifferent kinds of ECM [[wikt:repository|repositories]] can be used in combination. Among the possible kinds are:\n\n; [[File system]]s\n: File systems are used primarily for temporary storage, as input and output caches. ECM's goal is to reduce the data burden on the file system, and make the information generally available through Manage, Store, and Preserve technologies.\n; [[Content management system]]s\n:This is the actual storage and repository system for content, which can be a database or a specialized storage system.\n; [[Database]]s\n: Databases administer access information, but can also be used for the direct storage of documents, content, or media assets.\n; [[Data warehouse]]s\n: These are complex storage systems based on databases, which reference or provide information from all kinds of sources. They can also be designed with global functions, such as document or information warehouses.\n\n====Library services====\n''Library services'' are the administrative components of the ECM system that handle access to information. The library service is responsible for taking in and storing information from the Capture and Manage components. It also manages the storage locations in dynamic storage, the actual \"Store,\" and in the long-term Preserve archive. The storage location is determined only by the characteristics and classification of the information. The library service works in concert with the Manage components' database to provide the necessary functions of search and [[Information Retrieval|retrieval]].\n\nWhile the database does not \"know\" the physical location of a stored object, the library service manages [[computer data storage|online storage]] (direct access to data and documents),\n[[nearline storage]] (data and documents on a medium that can be accessed quickly, but not immediately, such as data on an optical disc that is present in a storage system's racks but not currently inserted in a drive that can read it), and [[offline storage]] (data and documents on a medium that is not quickly available, such as data stored offsite).\n\nIf the document management system does not provide the functionality, the library service must have ''version management'' to control the status of information, and ''check-in/check-out'', for controlled information provision.\n\nThe library service generates logs of information usage and editing, called an \"audit trail.\"\n\n====Storage technologies====\nA wide variety of technologies can be used to store information, depending on the application and system environment:\n\n; Magnetic online media\n: [[Hard drives]], typically configured as [[RAID]] systems, may be locally attached, part of a [[storage area network]] (SAN), or mounted from another server ([[network-attached storage]]).\n; Magnetic tape\n: [[Magnetic tape data storage]], in the form of automated storage units called [[tape library|tape libraries]], use robotics to provide nearline storage. Standalone tape drives may be used for backup, but not online access.\n; Digital optical media\n: Besides the common [[Compact Disc]] and [[DVD]] optical media in write-once or rewritable forms, Storage systems may use other specialized optical formats like [[magneto-optical drive]]s for storage and distribution of data. [[Optical jukebox]]es can be used for nearline storage. Optical media in jukeboxes can be removed, transitioning it from nearline to offline storage.\n; Cloud computing\n: Data can be stored on offsite [[cloud computing]] servers, accessed via the Internet.\n\n===Preserve===\n<!--\n[[:de:Bild:ECM Preserve.jpg|ECM: Preserve. Source: AIIM / PROJECT CONSULT 2003]]\n-->\n'''Preserve''' involves the long-term, safe storage and backup of static, unchanging information. Preservation is typically accomplished by the records management features of an ECM system and many are designed to help companies comply with government and industry regulations.\n\nEventually, content ceases to change and becomes static. The [[Digital preservation|preserve]] components of ECM handle the long-term, safe storage and backup of static information, as well as the temporary storage of information that does not need to be archived. [[Archive#Electronic archiving|Electronic archiving]], a related concept, has substantially broader functionality than ECM Preserve components. Electronic archiving systems generally consist of a combination of administration software like records management, imaging or document management, library services or information retrieval systems, and storage subsystems.\n\nOther forms of media are also suitable for long-term archiving. If the desire is merely to ensure information is available in the future, microfilm is still viable; unlike many digital records, microfilm is readable without access to the specialized software that created it. Hybrid systems combine microfilm with electronic media and database-supported access.\n\nLong-term storage systems require the timely planning and regular performance of data migrations, in order to keep information available in the changing technical landscape. As storage technologies fall into disuse, information must be moved to newer forms of storage, so that the stored information remains accessible using contemporary systems. For example, data stored on [[floppy disk]]s becomes essentially unusable, if floppy disk drives are no longer readily available; migrating the data stored on floppy disks to Compact Discs preserves not only the data but the ability to access it. This ongoing process is called ''continuous migration''.\n\nThe Preserve components contain special viewers, conversion and migration tools, and long-term storage media:\n\n====Long term storage media====\n; WORM [[optical disc]]\n: [[Write once read many]] (WORM) rotating digital optical storage media, including the {{convert|5.25|in|cm}} or {{convert|3.5|in|cm}} WORM disc in a protective sleeve, as well as [[CD-R]] and [[DVD-R]]. Recording methods vary for these media, which are held in jukeboxes for online and automated near line access.\n; WORM tape\n: [[Magnetic tape]]s used in special drives, that can be as secure as optical write-once, read-many media if used properly with specially secured tapes.\n; WORM hard disk drive\n: Magnetic disk storage with special software protection against overwriting, erasure, and editing; delivers security similar to optical write-once, read-many media. This category includes [[content-addressable storage]].\n; Storage networks\n: Storage networks, such as network-attached storage and storage area networks, can be used if they meet the requirements of edit-proof auditing with unchangeable storage and protection against manipulation and erasure.\n; Microform\n: [[Microform]]s like microfilm, microfiche, and [[aperture card]]s can be used to back up information that is no longer in use and does not require machine processing. It is typically used only to double-secure originally electronic information.\n; Paper\n: Paper still has use as a long-term storage medium, since it does not require migration, and can be read without any technical aids. In ECM systems, however, it is used only to double-secure originally electronic information.\n\n====Long term preservation strategies====\nTo secure the long term availability of information different [[digital preservation#Strategies|strategies]] are used for electronic archives.\n\nThe continuous '''migration''' of applications, index data, metadata and objects from older systems to new ones generates a lot of work but secures the accessibility and usability of information. During this process, information that is no longer relevant can be deleted. Conversion technologies are used to update the format of the stored information, where needed.\n\n'''Emulation''' of older software allows users to run and access the original data and objects. Special viewer software can identify the format of the preserved objects and can display the objects in the new software environment.\n\nStandards for interfaces, metadata, data structures and object formats are important to secure the availability of information.\n\n===Deliver===\nThe '''deliver''' components of ECM present information from the Manage, Store, and Preserve components. The AIIM component model for ECM is function-based, and doesn't impose a strict hierarchy; the Deliver components may contain functions used to enter information into other systems (such as transferring information to portable media, or generating formatted output files); or for readying information, such as by converting its format or compressing it, for the \"Store\" and \"Preserve\" components. The Deliver category's functionality is also known as \"output\"; technologies in this category are often termed ''[[Enterprise Output Management|output management]]''.\n\nThe Deliver components break down into three groups: '''transformation technologies''', '''security technologies''', and '''distribution'''. Transformation and security, as services, are [[middleware]] and should be equally available to all ECM components. For output, two functions are of primary importance: ''layout and design'', with tools for laying out and formatting output, and ''[[electronic publishing|publishing]]'', with applications for presenting information for distribution and publication.\n\nIn short, ECM delivery provides information to users. Secure distribution, collaboration, and version control take the forefront. In some cases, these components are still deployed as stand-alone systems without being incorporated into an enterprise-wide ECM system.\n\n====Transformation technologies====\nTransformations should always be controlled and trackable. This is done by background services that the end user generally does not see. Among the transformation technologies are:\n\n; Computer output to laser disc (COLD)\n: Unlike its use in the Capture stage, when used for delivery COLD prepares output data for distribution and transfer to the archive. Typical applications are lists and formatted output (for example, individualized customer letters). These technologies also include journals and logs generated by the ECM components. Unlike most imaging media, COLD records are indexed not in a database table, but by absolute positions within the document itself (i.e. page 1, line 82, position 12). As a result, COLD index fields are not available for editing after submission unless they are converted into a standard database.\n; [[Personalization]]\n: Functions and output can be customized to a particular user's needs.\n; XML (Extensible Markup Language)\n: A computer language that allows the description of interfaces, structures, metadata, and documents in a standardized, cross-platform manner.\n; [[Portable Document Format|PDF]] (Portable Document Format)\n: A cross-platform print and distribution format. Unlike image formats such as [[Tagged Image File Format|TIFF]], PDFs permit content searches, the addition of metadata, and the embedding of electronic signatures. When generated from electronic data, PDFs are [[resolution independence|resolution-independent]], allowing crisp reproduction at any scale.\n; XPS ([[XML Paper Specification]])\n:An XML specification developed by Microsoft, describing the formats and rules for distributing, archiving, rendering, and processing XPS documents.\n; Converters and viewers\n: Serve to reformat information to generate uniform formats, and also to display and output information from different formats.\n; [[Data compression|Compression]]\n: Used to reduce the storage space needed for pictorial information.\n; [[Web syndication|Syndication]]\n: Used for presenting content in different formats, selections, and forms in the context of content management. Syndication allows the same content to be used multiple times in different forms for different purposes.\n\n====Security technologies====\nSecurity technologies are available to all ECM components. For example, [[electronic signature]]s are used not only when documents are sent, but also in data capture via scanning, in order to document the completeness of the capture. [[Public key infrastructure]] is a basic technology for electronic signatures. It manages keys and certificates and checks the authenticity of signatures. Other electronic signatures confirm the identity of the sender and the integrity of the sent data, i.e., that it is complete and unchanged.\n\nIn Europe, there are three forms of electronic signatures, of different quality and security: simple, advanced, and qualified. In most European states the qualified electronic signature is legally admissible in legal documents and contracts.{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}}\n\n[[Digital rights management]] and [[watermark]]ing are used in content syndication and media asset management, to manage and secure intellectual property rights and copyrights. Digital rights management works with techniques like electronic watermarks that are integrated directly into the file and seeks to protect usage rights and protect content that is published on the Internet.\n\n====Distribution====\nAll of the above technologies serve to provide an ECM's contents to users by various routes, in a controlled and user-oriented manner. These can be active components such as e-mail, data media, memos, and passive publication on websites and portals where users can get the information themselves. Possible output and distribution media include:\n\n{{Div col}}\n* The Internet\n** Extranets\n** Intranets\n** [[electronic business|E-business]] portals\n** Employee portals\n* [[E-mail]]\n* Fax\n* Data transfer by EDI, XML or other formats\n* Mobile devices, like mobile phones, [[Personal digital assistant|PDA]]s, and others\n* Data media like CDs and DVDs\n* [[digital television|Digital TV]] and other [[multimedia]] services\n* [[Paper]]\n{{Div col end}}\n\nThe various Deliver components provide information to users in the best way for the given application, while controlling its use as far as possible.\n\n==Methods==\n\n===On-premises===\nECM was developed as a traditional software application that companies implemented on their own corporate networks. In this scenario, each individual company manages and maintains both the ECM application, and the network storage devices that store the data. Many on-premises ECM systems are highly customized for individual organizational needs.\nSince paper document capture requires the use of physical scanning devices, like [[Image scanner|scanner]]s or multi-function devices, it is typically performed on-premises. However, it can be outsourced to businesses that provide scanning services. Known as Service Bureaus, these companies complete high-volume scanning and indexing and return the electronic files to organizations via Web transfer or on CDs, DVDs, or other external storage devices.\n\n===Software as a service (SaaS)===\n[[SaaS]] ECM means that rather than deploying software on an in-house network, users access the application and their data online. It is also known as [[cloud computing]], hosted, and on-demand. As SaaS distribution technologies mature, businesses can receive the same features and customization capabilities as from on-premises ECM applications.\nSaaS delivery allows companies to more quickly begin using ECM since they do not have to purchase hardware or configure the applications, databases, or servers. In addition, organizations trade the capital costs associated with a hardware and software purchase for a monthly operating expense and storage capabilities that grow automatically to accommodate company growth.\n\n===Hybrid===\nIn some scenarios, companies find a hybrid composed of both SaaS and on-premises software work best for their situation. For example, hybrid ECM systems are being used to bridge the gap during company moves or to simplify information exchange following an acquisition. Hybrid is also being used when companies want to manage their own ECM on-premises, but also provide easy Web access to certain information for business partners or customers using a SaaS model. Hybrid makes the most sense when the two technologies are provided by the same manufacturer so that features and interfaces are an exact match.\n\n==ECM market development==\n{{Multiple issues|section=y|{{cite check|date=September 2010}}\n{{update|inaccurate=yes|date=September 2010}}\n}}\nPrior to 2003, the ECM market was dominated by a number of medium-sized independent vendors that fell into two categories: those who had originated as Document Management companies (''[[Laserfiche]]'', [[Saros Corporation|Saros]], [[Documentum]], [[docStar]], [[OpenText]], Db technology) and had begun adding on management of other enterprise content, and those who had started as Web Content Management providers ([[Interwoven]], [[Vignette Corporation|Vignette]], [[Stellent]]) and had begun trying to branch out into managing other types of content such as business documents and rich media. Larger vendors, such as IBM and Oracle, also had offerings in this space, and the market share remained largely fragmented.\n\nIn 2002, Documentum had added collaboration capabilities with its acquisition of [[eRoom]] while Interwoven and Vignette countered with their respective acquisitions of iManage and Intraspect. Similarly, Documentum purchased Bulldog for its Digital Asset Management (DAM) capabilities while Interwoven and OpenText countered with acquisitions of MediaBin and [[Artesia Digital Media Group|Artesia]]. OpenText also acquired European companies IXOS and Red Dot to shore up its software portfolio. In October 2003, EMC Corporation acquired Documentum. Soon EMC's primary competitors in the database space responded as [[IBM]] purchased FileNet and Oracle purchased Stellent in 2006. OpenText also purchased [[Hummingbird Ltd.]] in 2006. [[Hewlett-Packard]] (HP) entered the ECM space with its acquisition of Australian company Tower Software in 2008.

Examples: Hyland's [[OnBase]], Lexmark's Perceptive Software, docStar's Eclipse, WareITis Technologies' Records Studio. Another category is \"Social Content Management\". As its name suggests, these systems focus on social Web content like wikis, blogs, videos, browser or portal viewing, etc. Example: Alfresco.\n\nThe \"Online Channel Optimization\" systems are mainly Web content management and digital asset management systems. Examples: Autonomy, WordPress. The fourth category is \"Content Management as infrastructure\". These are vendor solutions that are used as enterprise content management platforms with all the core functionalities of the other types of content management systems, but the focus is on building solutions on top of the platform.

Systems that implement ECM generally provide a secure repository for managed items, be they analog or digital, that indexes them. They also include one or more methods for importing [[content (media)|content]] to bring new items under management and several presentation methods to make items available for use.\n\nWhile it is possible that content in an ECM is protected by [[Digital rights management|DRM]] it is not required.\n\nThe key feature of ECM that distinguishes it from \"simple\" content management is that an ECM is at least cognizant of the processes and procedures of the enterprise it is created for, and as such is particular to it.<ref name=\"AIIM whatis\">{{Cite web\n  | url = https://www.opentext.com/products-and-solutions/products/enterprise-content-management\n  | title = What is Enterprise Content Management (ECM)?\n  | work = OPENTEXT\n  | publisher = OPENTEXT\n  | accessdate = September 20, 2010 }}</ref>\n\n==Definition==\n; Late 2005:\n:''Enterprise content management is the technology used to capture, manage, store, preserve, and deliver content and documents related to organizational processes.''\n; Early 2006:\n:''Enterprise content management is the technology used to capture, manage, store, preserve, and deliver content and documents related to organizational processes.''\n:''ECM tools and strategies allow the management of an organization's [[unstructured information]], wherever that information exists.''\n; Early 2008:\n:''Enterprise Content Management (ECM) is the [[strategy | strategies]], methods, and tools used to capture, manage, store, preserve, and deliver content and documents related to organizational processes.

IIM is defined as ''the strategies, methods, and tools used to create, capture, automate, deliver, secure, and analyze content and documents related to organizational processes. IIM refers to the management of content AND data, not just content itself.''<ref>{{cite web|last1=Mancini|first1=John|title=The Next Wave: Moving from ECM to Intelligent Information Management|url=https://cdn2.hubspot.net/hubfs/332414/AIIM_Blog/Intel-info-Next-Wave-2017-updated.pdf|website=AIIM|publisher=AIIM}}</ref>\nThe latest definition encompasses areas that have traditionally been addressed by [[records management]] and by [[document management]] systems. It also implies the conversion of data between various digital and traditional forms, including paper and microfilm.\n\nECM as an [[umbrella term]] covers [[document management]], [[Web content management]], search, collaboration, [[records management]], [[digital asset management]] (DAM), [[workflow management system| workflow management]], [[Optical character recognition|capture and scanning]]. ECM is primarily aimed{{by whom?|date=August 2017}} at managing the life-cycle of information from initial publication or creation all the way through archival and eventual disposal. ECM applications are delivered{{by whom?|date=August 2017}} in four ways: \n\n* on-premises software (installed on an organization's own network)\n* [[software as a service]] (SaaS) (Web access to information that is stored on a software manufacturer's system) \n* a hybrid composed of both on-premises and SaaS components\n* [[Cloud computing|Infrastructure as a Service]] (IaaS) (which refers to online services that abstract the user from the details of infrastructure like physical computing resources, location, data partitioning, scaling, security, backup etc.)\n\nECM aims to make the management of corporate information easier through simplifying storage, security, version control, process routing, and retention.{{cn|date=August 2017}} The benefits to an organization include improved efficiency, better control, and reduced costs. For example, many banks have converted to storing copies of old cheques within ECM systems ('''ECMS'''s)  as opposed to the older method of keeping physical cheques in massive paper warehouses. Under the old system, a customer request for a copy of a cheque might take weeks, as the bank employees had to contact the warehouse where the right box, file, and cheque, would need to be located. The cheque would then need to be pulled, a copy made and mailed to the bank where it would finally be mailed to the customer. With a suitable ECM system in place, the bank employee might simply query the system for the customer\u2019s account number and the number of the requested cheque. When the image of the cheque appears on-screen, the bank can mail a copy immediately to the customer, usually while the customer is still on the phone.\n\n==Scope==\nEnterprise content management, as a form of [[content management]], combines the capture, search and networking of documents with [[digital archiving]], document management and [[workflow]]. It specifically includes the special challenges involved in using and preserving a company's internal, often unstructured information, in all of its forms. Therefore, most ECM solutions focus on [[business-to-employee]] (B2E) systems.\n\nAs ECM solutions have evolved, new components have emerged. For example, as content is checked in and out, each use generates new [[metadata]] about the content, to some extent automatically; information about how and when people use the content can allow the system to gradually acquire new filtering, routing and search pathways, [[corporate taxonomies]] and [[semantic network]]s, and retention-rule decisions. [[Email]] and [[instant messaging]] feature increasingly in decision-making processes; ECM can provide access to data about these communications, which can be used{{by whom|date=January 2016}} in business decisions.\n\nSolutions can provide [[intranet]] services to employees (B2E), and can also include [[enterprise portal]]s for [[business-to-business]] (B2B), [[business-to-government]] (B2G), [[government-to-business]] (G2B), or other business relationships. This category includes most former document-management [[groupware]] and workflow solutions that have not {{as of | 2016 | alt = yet}} fully converted their architecture to ECM, but provide a Web interface. Digital asset management is a form of ECM concerned with content stored using digital technology.\n\n==History==\nThe technologies that comprise ECM {{as of | 2016 | lc = on}} descend from the electronic [[document management system]]s (EDMS) of the late 1980s and early 1990s. The original EDMS products were stand-alone products, providing functionality in one of four areas: [[Document imaging|imaging]], workflow, document management, or [[Enterprise relationship management|ERM]] (see [[#Components|components]] below).\n\nThe typical early EDMS adopter deployed a small-scale imaging and workflow system, possibly to just a single department, in order to improve a paper-intensive process and to migrate towards the mythical [[paperless office]]. The first stand-alone EDMS technologies aimed to save time or to improve information access by reducing paper handling and paper storage, thereby reducing document loss and providing faster access to information. EDMS could provide online access to information formerly available only on paper, microfilm, or microfiche. By improving control over documents and document-oriented processes, EDMS streamlined time-consuming business practices. The audit trail generated by EDMS enhanced document security and provided metrics to help measure productivity and identify efficiencies.\n\nThrough the late 1990s, the EDMS industry continued to grow steadily.{{citation needed|date=January 2016}}\n\nAs more organizations achieved \"pockets\" of productivity with these technologies, it became clear that the various EDMS product categories were complementary. Organizations increasingly wanted to leverage multiple EDMS products. Consider, for example, a customer-service department\u2014where imaging, document management, and workflow could combine to allow agents to better resolve customer inquiries. Likewise, an accounting department might access supplier invoices from an ERM system, purchase orders from an imaging system, and contracts from a document management system as part of an approval workflow. As organizations established an [[Internet]] presence, they wanted to present information via the Web, which required managing Web content. Organizations that had automated individual departments now began to envision wider benefits from broader deployment. Many documents across multiple departments and affect multiple processes.\n\nThe movement toward integrated EDM systems merely reflected a common trend in the software industry: the ongoing integration of point systems into more comprehensive systems. For example, until the early 1990s, word processing, spreadsheet, and presentation software products were standalone products. Thereafter, the market shifted toward integration.\n\nEarly leaders already offered multiple stand-alone EDMS technologies. The first phase was to offer multiple systems as a single, packaged \"suite\", with little or no functional integration. Throughout the 1990s, integration increased.{{citation needed|date=January 2016}} Beginning in approximately 2001, the industry began to use the term ''enterprise content management'' to refer to these integrated systems.\n\nIn 2006, [[Microsoft]] (with its [[SharePoint]] product family) and [[Oracle Corporation]] (with [[Oracle Content Management]]) joined also entered the entry-level \"value\" market segment of ECM.<ref>\nMicrosoft launched its ECM strategy with MOSS 2007; Oracle, with Oracle 10g and the acquisition of Stellent, both in late 2006.</ref><ref>\n''Evolving Electronic Document Management Solutions: The Doculabs Report'', Third Edition. Chicago: Doculabs, 2002.</ref>\n\n[[Open source]] ECM products are also available.\n\nGovernment standards, including [[HIPAA]], [[Statement on Auditing Standards No. 70: Service Organizations|SAS 70]], [[BS 7799]] and [[ISO/IEC 27001]], influence the development and deployment of ECM. Standards compliance may make [[outsourcing]] to certified service providers a viable alternative to an internal ECM deployment.{{original research inline|date=January 2016}}\n\n{{As of | 2016}} organizations can deploy a single, flexible ECM system to manage information in all functional departments, including customer service, accounting, human resources, etc.\n\n==Adoption drivers==\nThere are numerous factors driving businesses to adopt an ECM solution, such as the need to increase efficiency, improving control of information, and reducing the [[Overall|overall cost]] of information management for the enterprise. ECM applications streamline access to records through keyword and full-text search allowing employees to get to the information they need directly from their desktops in seconds rather than searching multiple applications or digging through paper records.\n\nThese management systems can enhance record control to help businesses to comply with government and industry regulations such as HIPAA, [[Sarbanes-Oxley]], [[PCI DSS]], and the [[Federal Rules of Civil Procedure]]. Security functions including user-level, function-level, and even record-specific security options protect your most sensitive data. In fact, even information contained on a specific document can be masked using redaction features, so the rest of the document can be shared without compromising individual identity or key data. Every action taken within the system is tracked and reportable for auditing purposes for a wide variety of regulations.\n\nECM systems can reduce storage, paper and mailing needs, make employees more efficient, and result in better, more informed decisions across the enterprise\u2014all of which reduce the overhead costs of managing information. SaaS ECM services can convert expensive capital outlay for servers and network equipment into a monthly operating expense, while also reducing the IT resources required to manage enterprise records.\n\n==Characteristics==\nContent management includes ECM, Web content management (WCM), content syndication, and media asset management. Enterprise content management is not a closed-system solution or a distinct product category. Therefore, along with Document Related Technologies or Document Lifecycle Management, ECM is just one possible catch-all term for a wide range of technologies and vendors.\n\nThe content and structure of today's outward-directed [[Web portal]] will be the platform for tomorrow's internal information system. In his article in ''Computerwoche'',<ref>\nUlrich Kampffmeyer, \"ECM \u2014 Herrscher \u00fcber Information\". Computerwoche, CW-exktraKT, Munich, September 24th, 2001.</ref> Ulrich Kampffmeyer distilled ECM to three key ideas that distinguish such solutions from Web content management:\n\n<blockquote>\n; Enterprise content management as integrative middleware\n: ECM is used to overcome the restrictions of former vertical applications and island architectures. The user is basically unaware of using an ECM solution. ECM offers the requisite infrastructure for the new world of Web-based IT, which is establishing itself as a kind of third platform alongside conventional host and client/server systems. Therefore, EAI ([[enterprise application integration]]) and SOA ([[service-oriented architecture]]) will play an important role in the implementation and use of ECM.\n; Enterprise content management components as independent services\n: ECM is used to manage information without regard to the source or the required use. The functionality is provided as a service that can be used from all kinds of applications. The advantage of a service concept is that for any given functionality only one general service is available, thus avoiding redundant, expensive and difficult to maintain parallel functions. Therefore, standards for interfaces connecting different services will play an important role in the implementation of ECM.''\n; Enterprise content management as a uniform repository for all types of information\n: ECM is used as a content warehouse (both [[data warehouse]] and document warehouse) that combines company information in a repository with a uniform structure. Expensive redundancies and associated problems with [[information consistency]] are eliminated. All applications deliver their content to a single repository, which in turn provides needed information to all applications. Therefore, content integration and ILM ([[Information Lifecycle Management]]) will play an important role in the implementation and use of ECM.\n\nEnterprise content management is working properly when it is effectively \"invisible\" to users. ECM technologies are infrastructures that support specialized applications as subordinate services.\n\nECM thus is a collection of infrastructure components that fit into a multi-layer model and include all document related technologies (DRT) for handling, delivering, and managing structured data and unstructured information jointly. As such, enterprise content management is one of the necessary basic components of the overarching e-business application area. ECM also sets out to manage all the information of a WCM and covers archiving needs as a universal repository.<ref name=\"SER-ECM-whitepaper\"/></blockquote>\n\n==Components==\nECM combines components that can also be used as stand-alone systems without being incorporated into an enterprise-wide system.<ref name=\"SER-ECM-whitepaper\">\n''Trends in Records, Document and Enterprise Content Management''.

Capture is also used to collect electronic files and information into a consistent structure for management. Capture technologies also encompass the creation of metadata (index values) that describe characteristics of a document for easy location through search technology. For example, a medical chart might include the patient ID, patient name, date of visit, and procedure as index values to make it easy for medical personnel to locate the chart.\n\nEarlier [[document automation]] systems photographed documents for storage on [[microfilm]] or [[microfiche]]. [[Optical scanner]]s now make digital copies of paper documents. Documents already in digital form can be copied or linked to, if they are already available online.\n\nAutomatic or semi-automatic capture can use [[Electronic Data Interchange|EDI]] or [[XML]] documents, business and [[Enterprise resource planning|ERP]] applications or existing specialist application systems as sources.\n\n====Recognition technologies====\nVarious recognition technologies can be used to extract information from [[Image scanning|scanned]] documents and digital [[fax]]es, including:\n\n;[[Optical character recognition]] (OCR)\n:Converts images of typeset text into alphanumeric characters\n;[[Handwriting recognition|handprint character recognition]] (HCR)\n:Converts images of handwritten text into alphanumerics. Gives better results for short text in fixed locations than for freeform text.\n;[[Intelligent character recognition]] (ICR)\n:Extends OCR and HCR to use a comparison, logical connections, and checks against reference lists and existing master data to improve recognition. For example, on a form where a column of numbers is added up, the accuracy of the recognition can be checked by adding the recognized numbers and comparing them to the sum written on the original form.\n;[[Optical mark recognition]] (OMR)\n:Reads special markings, such as checkmarks or dots, in predefined fields.\n;[[Barcode]] recognition\n:Decodes industry-standard encodings of product and other commercial data.\n\n====Image cleanup====\nImage cleanup features include rotation, straightening, color adjustment, transposition, zoom, aligning, page separation, annotations and despeckling.\n\n====Forms processing====\nIn forms capture, there are two groups of technologies, although the information content and character of the documents may be identical. ''Forms processing'' is the capture of printed forms via scanning; recognition technologies are often used here since well-designed forms enable largely automatic processing. ''Automatic processing'' can be used to capture electronic forms, such as those submitted via Web pages, as long as the layout, structure, logic, and contents are known to the capture system.\n\n====COLD====\n[[Computer Output to Laser Disc]] (COLD) records reports and other documents on optical disks, or any form of digital storage for ongoing management by ECM systems. Another term for this is [[enterprise report management]] (ERM). Originally, the technology only worked with [[laserdisc]]s; the name was not changed after other technologies supplanted the laserdisc.\n\n====Aggregation====\n[[Data aggregation|Aggregation]] combines documents from different applications. The goal is to unify data from different sources, forwarding them to storage and processing systems in a uniform structure and format.\n\n====Indexing components====\n[[Subject indexing|Indexing]] improves searches, and provides alternative ways to organize the information.\n\nManual indexing assigns index database attributes to content by hand, typically used by the database of a \"manage\" component for administration and access. Manual indexing may make use of ''input designs'' to limit the information that can be entered; for example, entry masks may use program logic to restrict inputs based on other information known about the document.\n\nBoth automatic and manual attribute indexing can be made easier and better with preset input-design profiles; these can describe document classes that limit the number of possible index values, or automatically assign certain criteria.\n\nAutomatic classification programs can extract index, category, and transfer data autonomously. Automatic classification or categorizing, based on the information contained in electronic information objects, can evaluate information based on predefined criteria or in a self-learning process. This technique can be used with OCR-converted faxes, office files, or output files.\n\n===Manage===\nThe '''Manage''' category includes five traditional application areas:\n\n* Document management (DM)\n* [[Collaboration]] (or collaborative software, a.k.a. groupware)\n* Web content management (including Web portals)\n* Records management\n* Workflow and [[business process management]] (BPM)\n\nThe Manage category connects the other components, which can be used in combination or separately. Document management, Web content management, collaboration, workflow and business process management address the dynamic part of the information's lifecycle. Records management focuses on managing finalized documents in accordance with the organization's [[retention period|document retention]] policy, which in turn must comply with government mandates and industry practices.\n\nAll Manage components incorporate [[database]]s and access authorization systems.\nManage components are offered individually or integrated as suites. In many cases they already include the \"store\" components.\n\n====Document management====\n<!--\n[[:de:image:ECM Document Management.jpg|ECM: Document Management. Source: AIIM / PROJECT CONSULT 2003]]\n-->\n{{Main article|Document management system}}\nDocument management, in this context, refers to document management systems in the narrow sense of controlling documents from creation to archiving. Document management includes functions like:\n\n;Check in/check out\n:For checking stored information for consistency\n;Version management\n:To keep track of different versions of the same information with revisions and renditions (same information in a different format)\n;Search and navigation\n:For finding information and its associated contexts\n;Organizing documents\n:In structures like files, folders, and overviews\n\nHowever, document management increasingly overlaps with other \"Manage\" components, office applications like Microsoft Outlook and Exchange, or [[Lotus Notes]] and Domino, as well as \"library services\" for administering information storage.\n\n====Collaboration {{Anchor|Collaboration (collaborative systems, groupware)}}====\n<!--\n[[:de:image:ECM Collaboration.jpg|ECM: Collaboration. Source: AIIM / PROJECT CONSULT 2003]]\n-->\nCollaboration components in an ECM system help users work with each other to develop and process content. Many of these components were developed from [[collaborative software]], or ''groupware'', packages; ECM collaborative systems go much further, and include elements of [[knowledge management]].\n\nECM systems facilitate collaboration by using information databases and processing methods that are designed to be used simultaneously by multiple users, even when those users are working on the same content item. They make use of knowledge based on skills, resources and background data for joint information processing. Administration components, such as virtual whiteboards for brainstorming, appointment scheduling, and project management systems, communications application such as video conferencing, etc., may be included.\n\nCollaborative ECM may also integrate information from other applications, permitting joint information processing.\n\n====Web content management====\n<!--\n[[:de:bild:ECM Web Content Management.jpg|ECM-Komponenten: Web Content Management.

Source: AIIM / PROJECT CONSULT 2003]]\n-->\nUnlike traditional electronic archival systems, records management refers to the pure administration of records, important information, and data that companies are required to archive. Records management is independent of storage media; managed information does not necessarily need to be stored electronically, but can be on traditional physical media as well. Some of the functions of records management are:\n\n* Visualisation of file plans and other structured indexes for the orderly storage of information\n* Unambiguous indexing of information, supported by thesauri or controlled wordlists\n* Management of record retention schedules and deletion schedules\n* Protection of information in accordance with its characteristics, sometimes down to individual content components in documents\n* Use of international, industry-specific or company-wide standardized metadata for the unambiguous identification and description of stored information\n\n====Workflow/business process management====\n<!--\n[[:de:Bild:ECM Workflow.jpg|ECM-Komponenten: Workflow / Business Process Management. Source: AIIM / PROJECT CONSULT 2003]]\n-->\nWorkflow and business process management differ substantially.\n\n=====Workflow=====\nThere are different types of workflow: ''production workflow'' uses predefined sequences to guide and control processes, whereas in an ''ad-hoc workflow'', the user determines the process sequence on the fly.\n\nWorkflow can be implemented as ''workflow solutions'' with which users interact, or as ''workflow engines'', which act as a background service controlling the information and data flow.\n\nWorkflow management includes the following functions:\n\n* Visualization of process and organization structures\n* Capture, administration, visualization, and delivery of grouped information with its associated documents or data\n* Incorporation of data processing tools (such as specific applications) and documents (such as office products)\n* Parallel and sequential processing of procedures including simultaneous saving\n* Reminders, deadlines, delegation and other administration functionalities\n* Monitoring and documentation of process status, routing, and outcomes\n* Tools for designing and displaying process\n\nThe objective is to automate processes as much as possible by incorporating all necessary resources.\n\n=====Business process management=====\nDefinition cited from AIIM:\n''BPM is a way of looking at and then controlling the processes that are present in an organization. It is an effective methodology to use in times of crisis to make certain that the processes are efficient and effective, as this will result in a better and more cost efficient organization.\n''\n''Business process management'' (BPM) goes a step further than workflow. Although the words are often used interchangeably, BPM aims to completely integrate all of the affected applications within an enterprise, monitoring processes and assembling all required information. Among BPM's functions are:\n\nBPM offers complete workflow functionality, providing process and data monitoring at the server level. Enterprise application integration is used to link different applications. [[Business intelligence]], with rule structures, integrates information warehouses and provides utilities that assist users in their work.\n\n===Store===\nStore components temporarily store information that isn't required, desired, or ready for long-term storage or preservation. Even if the Store component uses media that are suitable for long-term archiving, \"Store\" is still separate from \"Preserve.\"\n\nThe Store components can be divided into three categories: '''Repositories''' as storage locations, '''Library Services''' as administration components for repositories, and storage '''Technologies'''. These infrastructure components are sometimes held at the operating system level (like the [[file system]]), and also include security technologies that work in tandem with the \"Deliver\" components. However, security technologies, including access control, are superordinated components of an ECM solution.\n\n====Repositories====\nDifferent kinds of ECM [[wikt:repository|repositories]] can be used in combination. Among the possible kinds are:\n\n; [[File system]]s\n: File systems are used primarily for temporary storage, as input and output caches. ECM's goal is to reduce the data burden on the file system, and make the information generally available through Manage, Store, and Preserve technologies.\n; [[Content management system]]s\n:This is the actual storage and repository system for content, which can be a database or a specialized storage system.\n; [[Database]]s\n: Databases administer access information, but can also be used for the direct storage of documents, content, or media assets.\n; [[Data warehouse]]s\n: These are complex storage systems based on databases, which reference or provide information from all kinds of sources. They can also be designed with global functions, such as document or information warehouses.\n\n====Library services====\n''Library services'' are the administrative components of the ECM system that handle access to information. The library service is responsible for taking in and storing information from the Capture and Manage components. It also manages the storage locations in dynamic storage, the actual \"Store,\" and in the long-term Preserve archive. The storage location is determined only by the characteristics and classification of the information. The library service works in concert with the Manage components' database to provide the necessary functions of search and [[Information Retrieval|retrieval]].\n\nWhile the database does not \"know\" the physical location of a stored object, the library service manages [[computer data storage|online storage]] (direct access to data and documents),\n[[nearline storage]] (data and documents on a medium that can be accessed quickly, but not immediately, such as data on an optical disc that is present in a storage system's racks but not currently inserted in a drive that can read it), and [[offline storage]] (data and documents on a medium that is not quickly available, such as data stored offsite).\n\nIf the document management system does not provide the functionality, the library service must have ''version management'' to control the status of information, and ''check-in/check-out'', for controlled information provision.\n\nThe library service generates logs of information usage and editing, called an \"audit trail.\"\n\n====Storage technologies====\nA wide variety of technologies can be used to store information, depending on the application and system environment:\n\n; Magnetic online media\n: [[Hard drives]], typically configured as [[RAID]] systems, may be locally attached, part of a [[storage area network]] (SAN), or mounted from another server ([[network-attached storage]]).\n; Magnetic tape\n: [[Magnetic tape data storage]], in the form of automated storage units called [[tape library|tape libraries]], use robotics to provide nearline storage. Standalone tape drives may be used for backup, but not online access.\n; Digital optical media\n: Besides the common [[Compact Disc]] and [[DVD]] optical media in write-once or rewritable forms, Storage systems may use other specialized optical formats like [[magneto-optical drive]]s for storage and distribution of data. [[Optical jukebox]]es can be used for nearline storage. Optical media in jukeboxes can be removed, transitioning it from nearline to offline storage.\n; Cloud computing\n: Data can be stored on offsite [[cloud computing]] servers, accessed via the Internet.\n\n===Preserve===\n<!--\n[[:de:Bild:ECM Preserve.jpg|ECM: Preserve. Source: AIIM / PROJECT CONSULT 2003]]\n-->\n'''Preserve''' involves the long-term, safe storage and backup of static, unchanging information. Preservation is typically accomplished by the records management features of an ECM system and many are designed to help companies comply with government and industry regulations.\n\nEventually, content ceases to change and becomes static. The [[Digital preservation|preserve]] components of ECM handle the long-term, safe storage and backup of static information, as well as the temporary storage of information that does not need to be archived. [[Archive#Electronic archiving|Electronic archiving]], a related concept, has substantially broader functionality than ECM Preserve components. Electronic archiving systems generally consist of a combination of administration software like records management, imaging or document management, library services or information retrieval systems, and storage subsystems.\n\nOther forms of media are also suitable for long-term archiving. If the desire is merely to ensure information is available in the future, microfilm is still viable; unlike many digital records, microfilm is readable without access to the specialized software that created it. Hybrid systems combine microfilm with electronic media and database-supported access.\n\nLong-term storage systems require the timely planning and regular performance of data migrations, in order to keep information available in the changing technical landscape. As storage technologies fall into disuse, information must be moved to newer forms of storage, so that the stored information remains accessible using contemporary systems. For example, data stored on [[floppy disk]]s becomes essentially unusable, if floppy disk drives are no longer readily available; migrating the data stored on floppy disks to Compact Discs preserves not only the data but the ability to access it. This ongoing process is called ''continuous migration''.\n\nThe Preserve components contain special viewers, conversion and migration tools, and long-term storage media:\n\n====Long term storage media====\n; WORM [[optical disc]]\n: [[Write once read many]] (WORM) rotating digital optical storage media, including the {{convert|5.25|in|cm}} or {{convert|3.5|in|cm}} WORM disc in a protective sleeve, as well as [[CD-R]] and [[DVD-R]]. Recording methods vary for these media, which are held in jukeboxes for online and automated near line access.\n; WORM tape\n: [[Magnetic tape]]s used in special drives, that can be as secure as optical write-once, read-many media if used properly with specially secured tapes.\n; WORM hard disk drive\n: Magnetic disk storage with special software protection against overwriting, erasure, and editing; delivers security similar to optical write-once, read-many media. This category includes [[content-addressable storage]].\n; Storage networks\n: Storage networks, such as network-attached storage and storage area networks, can be used if they meet the requirements of edit-proof auditing with unchangeable storage and protection against manipulation and erasure.\n; Microform\n: [[Microform]]s like microfilm, microfiche, and [[aperture card]]s can be used to back up information that is no longer in use and does not require machine processing. It is typically used only to double-secure originally electronic information.\n; Paper\n: Paper still has use as a long-term storage medium, since it does not require migration, and can be read without any technical aids. In ECM systems, however, it is used only to double-secure originally electronic information.\n\n====Long term preservation strategies====\nTo secure the long term availability of information different [[digital preservation#Strategies|strategies]] are used for electronic archives.\n\nThe continuous '''migration''' of applications, index data, metadata and objects from older systems to new ones generates a lot of work but secures the accessibility and usability of information. During this process, information that is no longer relevant can be deleted. Conversion technologies are used to update the format of the stored information, where needed.\n\n'''Emulation''' of older software allows users to run and access the original data and objects. Special viewer software can identify the format of the preserved objects and can display the objects in the new software environment.\n\nStandards for interfaces, metadata, data structures and object formats are important to secure the availability of information.\n\n===Deliver===\nThe '''deliver''' components of ECM present information from the Manage, Store, and Preserve components. The AIIM component model for ECM is function-based, and doesn't impose a strict hierarchy; the Deliver components may contain functions used to enter information into other systems (such as transferring information to portable media, or generating formatted output files); or for readying information, such as by converting its format or compressing it, for the \"Store\" and \"Preserve\" components. The Deliver category's functionality is also known as \"output\"; technologies in this category are often termed ''[[Enterprise Output Management|output management]]''.\n\nThe Deliver components break down into three groups: '''transformation technologies''', '''security technologies''', and '''distribution'''. Transformation and security, as services, are [[middleware]] and should be equally available to all ECM components. For output, two functions are of primary importance: ''layout and design'', with tools for laying out and formatting output, and ''[[electronic publishing|publishing]]'', with applications for presenting information for distribution and publication.\n\nIn short, ECM delivery provides information to users. Secure distribution, collaboration, and version control take the forefront. In some cases, these components are still deployed as stand-alone systems without being incorporated into an enterprise-wide ECM system.\n\n====Transformation technologies====\nTransformations should always be controlled and trackable. This is done by background services that the end user generally does not see. Among the transformation technologies are:\n\n; Computer output to laser disc (COLD)\n: Unlike its use in the Capture stage, when used for delivery COLD prepares output data for distribution and transfer to the archive. Typical applications are lists and formatted output (for example, individualized customer letters). These technologies also include journals and logs generated by the ECM components. Unlike most imaging media, COLD records are indexed not in a database table, but by absolute positions within the document itself (i.e. page 1, line 82, position 12). As a result, COLD index fields are not available for editing after submission unless they are converted into a standard database.\n; [[Personalization]]\n: Functions and output can be customized to a particular user's needs.\n; XML (Extensible Markup Language)\n: A computer language that allows the description of interfaces, structures, metadata, and documents in a standardized, cross-platform manner.\n; [[Portable Document Format|PDF]] (Portable Document Format)\n: A cross-platform print and distribution format. Unlike image formats such as [[Tagged Image File Format|TIFF]], PDFs permit content searches, the addition of metadata, and the embedding of electronic signatures. When generated from electronic data, PDFs are [[resolution independence|resolution-independent]], allowing crisp reproduction at any scale.\n; XPS ([[XML Paper Specification]])\n:An XML specification developed by Microsoft, describing the formats and rules for distributing, archiving, rendering, and processing XPS documents.\n; Converters and viewers\n: Serve to reformat information to generate uniform formats, and also to display and output information from different formats.\n; [[Data compression|Compression]]\n: Used to reduce the storage space needed for pictorial information.\n; [[Web syndication|Syndication]]\n: Used for presenting content in different formats, selections, and forms in the context of content management. Syndication allows the same content to be used multiple times in different forms for different purposes.\n\n====Security technologies====\nSecurity technologies are available to all ECM components. For example, [[electronic signature]]s are used not only when documents are sent, but also in data capture via scanning, in order to document the completeness of the capture. [[Public key infrastructure]] is a basic technology for electronic signatures. It manages keys and certificates and checks the authenticity of signatures. Other electronic signatures confirm the identity of the sender and the integrity of the sent data, i.e., that it is complete and unchanged.\n\nIn Europe, there are three forms of electronic signatures, of different quality and security: simple, advanced, and qualified. In most European states the qualified electronic signature is legally admissible in legal documents and contracts.{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}}\n\n[[Digital rights management]] and [[watermark]]ing are used in content syndication and media asset management, to manage and secure intellectual property rights and copyrights. Digital rights management works with techniques like electronic watermarks that are integrated directly into the file and seeks to protect usage rights and protect content that is published on the Internet.\n\n====Distribution====\nAll of the above technologies serve to provide an ECM's contents to users by various routes, in a controlled and user-oriented manner. These can be active components such as e-mail, data media, memos, and passive publication on websites and portals where users can get the information themselves. Possible output and distribution media include:\n\n{{Div col}}\n* The Internet\n** Extranets\n** Intranets\n** [[electronic business|E-business]] portals\n** Employee portals\n* [[E-mail]]\n* Fax\n* Data transfer by EDI, XML or other formats\n* Mobile devices, like mobile phones, [[Personal digital assistant|PDA]]s, and others\n* Data media like CDs and DVDs\n* [[digital television|Digital TV]] and other [[multimedia]] services\n* [[Paper]]\n{{Div col end}}\n\nThe various Deliver components provide information to users in the best way for the given application, while controlling its use as far as possible.\n\n==Methods==\n\n===On-premises===\nECM was developed as a traditional software application that companies implemented on their own corporate networks. In this scenario, each individual company manages and maintains both the ECM application, and the network storage devices that store the data. Many on-premises ECM systems are highly customized for individual organizational needs.\nSince paper document capture requires the use of physical scanning devices, like [[Image scanner|scanner]]s or multi-function devices, it is typically performed on-premises. However, it can be outsourced to businesses that provide scanning services. Known as Service Bureaus, these companies complete high-volume scanning and indexing and return the electronic files to organizations via Web transfer or on CDs, DVDs, or other external storage devices.\n\n===Software as a service (SaaS)===\n[[SaaS]] ECM means that rather than deploying software on an in-house network, users access the application and their data online. It is also known as [[cloud computing]], hosted, and on-demand. As SaaS distribution technologies mature, businesses can receive the same features and customization capabilities as from on-premises ECM applications.\nSaaS delivery allows companies to more quickly begin using ECM since they do not have to purchase hardware or configure the applications, databases, or servers. In addition, organizations trade the capital costs associated with a hardware and software purchase for a monthly operating expense and storage capabilities that grow automatically to accommodate company growth.\n\n===Hybrid===\nIn some scenarios, companies find a hybrid composed of both SaaS and on-premises software work best for their situation. For example, hybrid ECM systems are being used to bridge the gap during company moves or to simplify information exchange following an acquisition. Hybrid is also being used when companies want to manage their own ECM on-premises, but also provide easy Web access to certain information for business partners or customers using a SaaS model. Hybrid makes the most sense when the two technologies are provided by the same manufacturer so that features and interfaces are an exact match.\n\n==ECM market development==\n{{Multiple issues|section=y|{{cite check|date=September 2010}}\n{{update|inaccurate=yes|date=September 2010}}\n}}\nPrior to 2003, the ECM market was dominated by a number of medium-sized independent vendors that fell into two categories: those who had originated as Document Management companies (''[[Laserfiche]]'', [[Saros Corporation|Saros]], [[Documentum]], [[docStar]], [[OpenText]], Db technology) and had begun adding on management of other enterprise content, and those who had started as Web Content Management providers ([[Interwoven]], [[Vignette Corporation|Vignette]], [[Stellent]]) and had begun trying to branch out into managing other types of content such as business documents and rich media. Larger vendors, such as IBM and Oracle, also had offerings in this space, and the market share remained largely fragmented.\n\nIn 2002, Documentum had added collaboration capabilities with its acquisition of [[eRoom]] while Interwoven and Vignette countered with their respective acquisitions of iManage and Intraspect. Similarly, Documentum purchased Bulldog for its Digital Asset Management (DAM) capabilities while Interwoven and OpenText countered with acquisitions of MediaBin and [[Artesia Digital Media Group|Artesia]]. OpenText also acquired European companies IXOS and Red Dot to shore up its software portfolio. In October 2003, EMC Corporation acquired Documentum. Soon EMC's primary competitors in the database space responded as [[IBM]] purchased FileNet and Oracle purchased Stellent in 2006. OpenText also purchased [[Hummingbird Ltd.]] in 2006. [[Hewlett-Packard]] (HP) entered the ECM space with its acquisition of Australian company Tower Software in 2008. In March 2009, [[Autonomy Corporation|Autonomy]] purchased Interwoven, in July 2009 OpenText acquired Vignette, and in February 2011 OpenText acquired MetaStorm.

Gartner also predicted that there will be further market consolidation, acquisition, and separation of vendors into platform and solution providers.<ref>Gartner Magic Quadrant for Enterprise Content Management, 2008\"</ref>/>{{Update after|2010|09}} The same Gartner report classifies enterprise content management systems into four main categories: First, \"Transactional content management solutions\". These systems focus on imaging, capture, business process management and workflow, records management and compliance, search and e-forms. Examples: Hyland's [[OnBase]], Lexmark's Perceptive Software, docStar's Eclipse, WareITis Technologies' Records Studio. Another category is \"Social Content Management\". As its name suggests, these systems focus on social Web content like wikis, blogs, videos, browser or portal viewing, etc. Example: Alfresco.\n\nThe \"Online Channel Optimization\" systems are mainly Web content management and digital asset management systems. Examples: Autonomy, WordPress. The fourth category is \"Content Management as infrastructure\". These are vendor solutions that are used as enterprise content management platforms with all the core functionalities of the other types of content management systems, but the focus is on building solutions on top of the platform.
