Dubner]]. It was published on April 12, 2005, by [[William Morrow and Company|William Morrow]]. The book has been described as melding<!--sic - please do not change the spelling unless you have read the cited source and have a sufficient command of the English language--> [[popular culture|pop culture]] with [[economics]].{{r|deahl}} By late 2009, the book had sold over 4 million copies worldwide.{{r|fox}}\n\n==Overview==\nThe book is a collection of articles written by Levitt, an expert who had gained a reputation for applying economic theory to diverse subjects not usually covered by \"traditional\" economists. In ''Freakonomics'', Levitt and Dubner argue that economics is, at root, the study of [[incentive]]s. The book's chapters cover:\n* Chapter 1: Discovering [[cheating]] as applied to [[teacher]]s and [[sumo]] wrestlers, as well as a typical [[Washington, D.C.]]\u2013area [[bagel]] business and its customers\n* Chapter 2: Information control as applied to the [[Ku Klux Klan]] and [[real-estate]] agents\n* Chapter 3: The economics of [[drug dealing]], including the surprisingly [[minimum wage|low earnings]] and abject working conditions of [[crack cocaine]] dealers\n* Chapter 4: [[Legalized abortion and crime effect|The role legalized abortion has played in reducing crime]], contrasted with the policies and downfall of [[Romania]]n dictator [[Nicolae Ceau\u015fescu]] (Levitt explored this topic in an earlier paper entitled \"[[The Impact of Legalized Abortion on Crime]],\" written with [[John J. Donohue III|John Donohue]].)\n* Chapter 5: The negligible effects of good [[parenting]] on [[education]]\n* Chapter 6: The socioeconomic patterns of naming children ([[nominative determinism]])\n\nOne example of the authors' use of economic theory involves demonstrating the existence of cheating among sumo wrestlers. In a sumo tournament, all wrestlers in the top division compete in 15 matches and face demotion if they do not win at least eight of them. The sumo community is very close-knit, and the wrestlers at the top levels tend to know each other well. The authors looked at the final match, and considered the case of a wrestler with seven wins, seven losses, and one fight to go, fighting against an 8\u20136 wrestler. Statistically, the 7\u20137 wrestler should have a slightly below even chance, since the 8\u20136 wrestler is slightly better. However, the 7\u20137 wrestler actually wins around 80% of the time. Levitt uses this statistic and other data gleaned from sumo wrestling matches, along with the effect that allegations of corruption have on match results, to conclude that those who already have 8 wins [[collusion|collude]] with those who are 7\u20137 and let them win, since they have already secured their position for the following tournament. Despite condemnation of the claims by the [[Japan Sumo Association]] following the book's publication in 2005, the 2011 Grand Tournament in [[Tokyo]] was canceled for the first time since 1946 because of allegations of match-fixing.{{r|bbc_sumo}}\n\nThe authors attempt to demonstrate the power of [[data mining]], as a number of their results emerge from Levitt's analysis of various databases. The authors posit that various incentives encourage teachers to cheat by assisting their students with multiple-choice [[high-stakes testing|high-stakes tests]]. Such cheating in the [[Chicago]] school system is inferred from detailed analysis of students' answers to multiple-choice questions. Levitt asks, \"What would the pattern of answers look like if the teacher cheated?\", and hypotheses that the more difficult questions found at the end of test sections will be answered correctly more frequently than the easy questions at the beginning of test sections.\n\n===Reappraisals===\nIn Chapter 2 of ''Freakonomics'', the authors wrote of their visit to folklorist [[Stetson Kennedy]]'s Florida home where the topic of Kennedy's investigations of the [[Ku Klux Klan]] were discussed. However, in their January 8, 2006, column in ''[[The New York Times Magazine]]'', Dubner and Levitt wrote of questions about Stetson Kennedy's research (\"Hoodwinked\", pp.&nbsp;26\u201328) leading to the conclusion that Kennedy's research was at times embellished for effectiveness.\n\nIn the \"Revised and Expanded Edition\" this embellishment was noted and corrected:\n\"Several months after ''Freakonomics'' was first published, it was brought to our attention that this man's portrayal of his crusade, and various other Klan matters, was considerably overstated&nbsp;... we felt it was important to set straight the historical record.\"{{r|freakonomics_xiv}}\n\n==Criticism==\n''Freakonomics'' has been criticized for being a work of [[sociology]] or [[criminology]], rather than economics. Israeli economist [[Ariel Rubinstein]] criticized the book for making use of dubious statistics and complained that \"economists like Levitt ... have swaggered off into other fields\", saying that the \"connection to economics ... [is] none\" and that the book is an example of \"[[Economic imperialism (economics)|academic imperialism]]\".{{r|rubinstein}} [[Arnold Kling]] has suggested the book is an example of \"amateur sociology\".{{r|kling}}\n\n===The impact of legalized abortion on crime===\n{{further|Legalized abortion and crime effect}}\n\nRevisiting a question first studied empirically in the 1960s, Donohue and Levitt argue that the legalization of abortion can account for almost half of the reduction in crime witnessed in the 1990s.  This paper has sparked much controversy, to which Levitt has said\n:\"The numbers we're talking about, in terms of crime, are absolutely trivial when you compare it to the broader debate on abortion. From a pro-life view of the world: If abortion is murder then we have a million murders a year through abortion. And the few thousand homicides that will be prevented according to our analysis are just nothing\u2014they are a pebble in the ocean relative to the tragedy that is abortion. So, my own view, when we [did] the study and it hasn't changed is that: our study shouldn't change anybody's opinion about whether abortion should be legal and easily available or not. It's really a study about crime, not abortion.\"<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=4583937 |title='Freakonomics': Musings of a 'Rogue Economist' : NPR |website= |accessdate=}}</ref>\n\nIn 2003, Theodore Joyce argued that legalized abortion had little impact on crime, contradicting Donohue and Levitt's results (\"Did Legalized Abortion Lower Crime?\" Journal of Human Resources, 2003, 38(1), pp.&nbsp;1\u201337). In 2004, the authors published a response,<ref>{{cite web |author=John J. Donohue III & Stephen D. Levitt |publisher=The Journal of Human Resources |year=2004 |url=http://pricetheory.uchicago.edu/levitt/Papers/DonohueLevittReply2004.pdf |title=Further Evidence that Legalized Abortion Lowered Crime: A Reply to Joyce |website= |accessdate=2008-12-03}}</ref> in which they argued that Joyce's argument was flawed due to [[omitted-variable bias]].\n\nIn November 2005, [[Federal Reserve Bank of Boston]] economist Christopher Foote and his research assistant Christopher Goetz published a working paper,<ref name=\"auto\">{{cite web |author=Christopher L. Foote & Christopher F. Goetz |publisher=Federal Reserve Bank of Boston |date=2008-01-31 |url=http://www.bos.frb.org/economic/wp/wp2005/wp0515.pdf |title=The Impact of Legalized Abortion on Crime: Comment |website= |accessdate=2008-05-12}}</ref> in which they argued that the results in Donohue and Levitt's abortion and crime paper were due to statistical errors made by the authors: the omission of state-year interactions and the use of the total number of arrests instead of the arrest rate in explaining changes in the murder rate. When the corrections were made, Foote and Goetz argued that abortion actually increased violent crime instead of decreasing it and did not affect property crime. They even concluded that the majority of women who had abortions in the 1970s were [[middle class]] [[White Americans|whites]] rather than [[Poverty|low income]] minorities as Levitt stated; this was, they stated, because white middle-class women had the financial means for an abortion. ''[[The Economist]]'' remarked on the news of the errors that \"for someone of Mr Levitt's iconoclasm and ingenuity, technical ineptitude is a much graver charge than moral turpitude. To be politically incorrect is one thing; to be simply incorrect quite another.\"<ref>{{cite news |publisher=The Economist |url=http://www.economist.com/finance/PrinterFriendly.cfm?story_id=5246700 |title=Abortion, Crime, and Econometrics |date=2005-12-01 |work= |accessdate=2008-05-12}}</ref> In January 2006, Donohue and Levitt published a response,<ref>{{cite web |author=John J. Donohue III & Stephen D. Levitt |date=January 2006 |url=http://pricetheory.uchicago.edu/levitt/Papers/ResponseToFooteGoetz2006.pdf |title=Measurement Error, Legalized Abortion, the Decline in Crime: A Response to Foote and Goetz |website= |accessdate=2008-12-03}}</ref> in which they admitted the errors in their original paper but also pointed out Foote and Goetz's correction was flawed due to heavy attenuation bias. The authors argued that, after making necessary changes to fix the original errors, the corrected link between abortion and crime was now weaker but still statistically significant, contrary to Foote and Goetz's claims. Foote and Goetz, however, soon produced a rebuttal of their own and said that even after analyzing the data using the methods that Levitt and Donohue recommend, the data does not show a positive correlation between abortion rates and crime rates.<ref name=\"auto\"/> They are quick to point out that this does not necessarily disprove Levitt's thesis, however, and emphasize that with data this messy and incomplete, it is in all likelihood not even possible to prove or disprove Donohue and Levitt's conclusion.\n\n''Freakonomics'' commented on the effects of an [[Abortion in Romania|abortion ban in Romania]] ([[Decree 770]]), stating that \"Compared to Romanian children born just a year earlier, the cohort of children born after the abortion ban would do worse in every measurable way: they would test lower in school, they would have less success in the labor market, and they would also prove much more likely to become criminals. (p. 118)\". John DiNardo, a professor at the [[University of Michigan]], retorts that the paper cited by ''Freakonomics'' states \"virtually the opposite of what is actually claimed\":\n{{quote|source=Freakonomics: Scholarship in the Service of Storytelling{{r|jdinardo0}}|On average, children born in 1967 just after abortions became illegal display better educational and labor market achievements than children born prior to the change. This outcome can be explained by a change in the composition of women having children: urban, educated women were more likely to have abortions prior to the policy change, so a higher proportion of children were born into urban, educated households. (Pop-Eleches, 2002, p. 34).|John DiNardo}}\n\nLevitt responded on the ''Freakonomics'' Blog that ''Freakonomics'' and Pop-Eleches \"are saying the same thing\":\n{{quote|Here is the abstract of the version of the Pop-Eleches paper that we cited:\n\n{{quote|\u2026Children born after the abortion ban attained more years of schooling and greater labor market success. This is because urban, educated women were more likely to have abortions prior to the policy change, and the relative number of children born to this type of woman increased after the ban. However, controlling for composition using observable background variables, children born after the ban on abortions had worse educational and labor market achievements as adults. Additionally, I provide evidence of crowding in the school system and some suggestive evidence that cohorts born after the introduction of the abortion ban had higher infant mortality and increased criminal behavior later in life.}}\n\nThe introduction of the Pop-Eleches paper says:\n\n{{quote|This finding is consistent with the view that children who were unwanted during pregnancy had worse socio-economic outcomes once they became adults.}}}}\n\n===Effects of extra police on crime===\n''Freakonomics'' claimed that it was possible to \"tease out\" the effect of extra police on crime by analyzing electoral cycles. The evidence behind these claims was shown to be due partly to a programming error. McCrary stated \"While municipal police force size does appear to vary over state and local electoral cycles ... elections do not induce enough variation in police hiring to generate informative estimates of the effect of police on crime.\"{{r|jdinardo0}}\n\n===Defamation case===\nOn April 10, 2006, [[John Lott]] filed suit<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.overlawyered.com/lott_complaint.pdf/Lott%20v%20Levitt.pdf|title=PDF of Lott's complaint v.

Dubner]] claimed that the results of Lott's research in ''[[More Guns, Less Crime]]'' had not been replicated by other academics. In the emails to McCall, who had pointed to a number of papers in different academic publications that had replicated Lott's work, Levitt wrote that the work by authors supporting Lott in a special 2001 issue of ''[[The Journal of Law and Economics]]'' had not been peer-reviewed, alleged that Lott had paid the University of Chicago Press to publish the papers, and that papers with results opposite of Lott's had been blocked from publication in that issue.<ref>{{Cite news|first=Michael |last=Higgins |title=Best-seller leads scholar to file lawsuit; Defamation allegation targets U. of C. author |publisher=Chicago Tribune |page=3 |date=2006-04-11}}</ref>\n\nA federal judge found that Levitt's replication claim in ''Freakonomics'' was not defamation but found merit in Lott's complaint about the email claims.<ref>\"[http://johnrlott.tripod.com/2007/01/judge-castillo-issues-decision-on-lott.html Judge Castillo issues a decision on Lott v.

McCall that he himself was a peer reviewer in the 2001 issue of ''The Journal of Law and Economics'', that Lott had not engaged in bribery (paying for extra costs of printing and postage for a conference issue is customary), and that he knew that \"scholars with varying opinions\" (including Levitt himself) had been invited to participate.<ref name=\"settlement\">{{Cite journal|last=Glenn |first=David |date=2007-08-10 |journal=Chronicle of Higher Education |title=Dueling Economists Reach Settlement in Defamation Lawsuit |volume=53|page=10| url=http://chronicle.com/article/Dueling-Economists-Reach/6720 |issue=49}}</ref><ref name=\"CHD200707\"/> The ''[[Chronicle of Higher Education]]'' characterized Levitt's letter as offering \"a [[Duesenberg#Etymological note|doozy]] of a concession\".<ref name=\"CHD200707\">{{cite journal|url=http://chronicle.com/article/Unusual-Agreement-Means/39297|title=Unusual Agreement Means Settlement May Be Near in 'Lott v.

Dubner]]. It was published on April 12, 2005, by [[William Morrow and Company|William Morrow]]. The book has been described as melding<!--sic - please do not change the spelling unless you have read the cited source and have a sufficient command of the English language--> [[popular culture|pop culture]] with [[economics]].{{r|deahl}} By late 2009, the book had sold over 4 million copies worldwide.{{r|fox}}\n\n==Overview==\nThe book is a collection of articles written by Levitt, an expert who had gained a reputation for applying economic theory to diverse subjects not usually covered by \"traditional\" economists. In ''Freakonomics'', Levitt and Dubner argue that economics is, at root, the study of [[incentive]]s. The book's chapters cover:\n* Chapter 1: Discovering [[cheating]] as applied to [[teacher]]s and [[sumo]] wrestlers, as well as a typical [[Washington, D.C.]]\u2013area [[bagel]] business and its customers\n* Chapter 2: Information control as applied to the [[Ku Klux Klan]] and [[real-estate]] agents\n* Chapter 3: The economics of [[drug dealing]], including the surprisingly [[minimum wage|low earnings]] and abject working conditions of [[crack cocaine]] dealers\n* Chapter 4: [[Legalized abortion and crime effect|The role legalized abortion has played in reducing crime]], contrasted with the policies and downfall of [[Romania]]n dictator [[Nicolae Ceau\u015fescu]] (Levitt explored this topic in an earlier paper entitled \"[[The Impact of Legalized Abortion on Crime]],\" written with [[John J. Donohue III|John Donohue]].)\n* Chapter 5: The negligible effects of good [[parenting]] on [[education]]\n* Chapter 6: The socioeconomic patterns of naming children ([[nominative determinism]])\n\nOne example of the authors' use of economic theory involves demonstrating the existence of cheating among sumo wrestlers. In a sumo tournament, all wrestlers in the top division compete in 15 matches and face demotion if they do not win at least eight of them. The sumo community is very close-knit, and the wrestlers at the top levels tend to know each other well. The authors looked at the final match, and considered the case of a wrestler with seven wins, seven losses, and one fight to go, fighting against an 8\u20136 wrestler. Statistically, the 7\u20137 wrestler should have a slightly below even chance, since the 8\u20136 wrestler is slightly better. However, the 7\u20137 wrestler actually wins around 80% of the time. Levitt uses this statistic and other data gleaned from sumo wrestling matches, along with the effect that allegations of corruption have on match results, to conclude that those who already have 8 wins [[collusion|collude]] with those who are 7\u20137 and let them win, since they have already secured their position for the following tournament. Despite condemnation of the claims by the [[Japan Sumo Association]] following the book's publication in 2005, the 2011 Grand Tournament in [[Tokyo]] was cancelled for the first time since 1946 because of allegations of match fixing.{{r|bbc_sumo}}\n\nThe authors attempt to demonstrate the power of [[data mining]], as a number of their results emerge from Levitt's analysis of various databases. The authors posit that various incentives encourage teachers to cheat by assisting their students with multiple-choice [[high-stakes testing|high-stakes tests]]. Such cheating in the [[Chicago]] school system is inferred from detailed analysis of students' answers to multiple choice questions. Levitt asks, \"What would the pattern of answers look like if the teacher cheated?\", and hypothesises that the more difficult questions found at the end of test sections will be answered correctly more frequently than the easy questions at the beginning of test sections.\n\n===Reappraisals===\nIn Chapter 2 of ''Freakonomics'', the authors wrote of their visit to folklorist [[Stetson Kennedy]]'s Florida home where the topic of Kennedy's investigations of the [[Ku Klux Klan]] were discussed. However, in their January 8, 2006, column in ''[[The New York Times Magazine]]'', Dubner and Levitt wrote of questions about Stetson Kennedy's research (\"Hoodwinked\", pp.&nbsp;26\u201328) leading to the conclusion that Kennedy's research was at times embellished for effectiveness.\n\nIn the \"Revised and Expanded Edition\" this embellishment was noted and corrected:\n\"Several months after ''Freakonomics'' was first published, it was brought to our attention that this man's portrayal of his crusade, and various other Klan matters, was considerably overstated&nbsp;... we felt it was important to set straight the historical record.\"{{r|freakonomics_xiv}}\n\n==Criticism==\n''Freakonomics'' has been criticized for being a work of [[sociology]] or [[criminology]], rather than economics. Israeli economist [[Ariel Rubinstein]] criticized the book for making use of dubious statistics and complained that \"economists like Levitt ... have swaggered off into other fields\", saying that the \"connection to economics ... [is] none\" and that the book is an example of \"[[Economic imperialism (economics)|academic imperialism]]\".{{r|rubinstein}} [[Arnold Kling]] has suggested the book is an example of \"amateur sociology\".{{r|kling}}\n\n===The impact of legalized abortion on crime===\n{{further|Legalized abortion and crime effect}}\n\nRevisiting a question first studied empirically in the 1960s, Donohue and Levitt argue that the legalization of abortion can account for almost half of the reduction in crime witnessed in the 1990s.  This paper has sparked much controversy, to which Levitt has said\n:\"The numbers we're talking about, in terms of crime, are absolutely trivial when you compare it to the broader debate on abortion. From a pro-life view of the world: If abortion is murder then we have a million murders a year through abortion. And the few thousand homicides that will be prevented according to our analysis are just nothing\u2014they are a pebble in the ocean relative to the tragedy that is abortion. So, my own view, when we [did] the study and it hasn't changed is that: our study shouldn't change anybody's opinion about whether abortion should be legal and easily available or not. It's really a study about crime, not abortion.\"<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=4583937 |title='Freakonomics': Musings of a 'Rogue Economist' : NPR |website= |accessdate=}}</ref>\n\nIn 2003, Theodore Joyce argued that legalized abortion had little impact on crime, contradicting Donohue and Levitt's results (\"Did Legalized Abortion Lower Crime?\" Journal of Human Resources, 2003, 38(1), pp.&nbsp;1\u201337). In 2004, the authors published a response,<ref>{{cite web |author=John J. Donohue III & Stephen D. Levitt |publisher=The Journal of Human Resources |year=2004 |url=http://pricetheory.uchicago.edu/levitt/Papers/DonohueLevittReply2004.pdf |title=Further Evidence that Legalized Abortion Lowered Crime: A Reply to Joyce |website= |accessdate=2008-12-03}}</ref> in which they argued that Joyce's argument was flawed due to [[omitted-variable bias]].\n\nIn November 2005, [[Federal Reserve Bank of Boston]] economist Christopher Foote and his research assistant Christopher Goetz published a working paper,<ref name=\"auto\">{{cite web |author=Christopher L. Foote & Christopher F. Goetz |publisher=Federal Reserve Bank of Boston |date=2008-01-31 |url=http://www.bos.frb.org/economic/wp/wp2005/wp0515.pdf |title=The Impact of Legalized Abortion on Crime: Comment |website= |accessdate=2008-05-12}}</ref> in which they argued that the results in Donohue and Levitt's abortion and crime paper were due to statistical errors made by the authors: the omission of state-year interactions and the use of the total number of arrests instead of the arrest rate in explaining changes in the murder rate. When the corrections were made, Foote and Goetz argued that abortion actually increased violent crime instead of decreasing it and did not affect property crime. They even concluded that the majority of women who had abortions in the 1970s were [[middle class]] [[White Americans|whites]] rather than [[Poverty|low income]] minorities as Levitt stated; this was, they stated, because white middle class women had the financial means for an abortion. ''[[The Economist]]'' remarked on the news of the errors that \"for someone of Mr Levitt's iconoclasm and ingenuity, technical ineptitude is a much graver charge than moral turpitude. To be politically incorrect is one thing; to be simply incorrect quite another.\"<ref>{{cite news |publisher=The Economist |url=http://www.economist.com/finance/PrinterFriendly.cfm?story_id=5246700 |title=Abortion, Crime, and Econometrics |date=2005-12-01 |work= |accessdate=2008-05-12}}</ref> In January 2006, Donohue and Levitt published a response,<ref>{{cite web |author=John J. Donohue III & Stephen D. Levitt |date=January 2006 |url=http://pricetheory.uchicago.edu/levitt/Papers/ResponseToFooteGoetz2006.pdf |title=Measurement Error, Legalized Abortion, the Decline in Crime: A Response to Foote and Goetz |website= |accessdate=2008-12-03}}</ref> in which they admitted the errors in their original paper but also pointed out Foote and Goetz's correction was flawed due to heavy attenuation bias. The authors argued that, after making necessary changes to fix the original errors, the corrected link between abortion and crime was now weaker but still statistically significant, contrary to Foote and Goetz's claims. Foote and Goetz, however, soon produced a rebuttal of their own and said that even after analyzing the data using the methods that Levitt and Donohue recommend, the data does not show a positive correlation between abortion rates and crime rates.<ref name=\"auto\"/> They are quick to point out that this does not necessarily disprove Levitt's thesis, however, and emphasize that with data this messy and incomplete, it is in all likelihood not even possible to prove or disprove Donohue and Levitt's conclusion.\n\n''Freakonomics'' commented on the effects of an [[Abortion in Romania|abortion ban in Romania]] ([[Decree 770]]), stating that \"Compared to Romanian children born just a year earlier, the cohort of children born after the abortion ban would do worse in every measurable way: they would test lower in school, they would have less success in the labor market, and they would also prove much more likely to become criminals. (p. 118)\". John DiNardo, a professor at the [[University of Michigan]], retorts that the paper cited by ''Freakonomics'' states \"virtually the opposite of what is actually claimed\":\n{{quote|source=Freakonomics: Scholarship in the Service of Storytelling{{r|jdinardo0}}|On average, children born in 1967 just after abortions became illegal display better educational and labor market achievements than children born  prior to the change. This outcome can be explained by a change in the composition of women having children: urban, educated women were more likely to have abortions prior to the policy change, so a higher proportion of children were born into urban, educated households. (Pop-Eleches, 2002, p. 34).|John DiNardo}}\n\nLevitt responded on the ''Freakonomics'' Blog that ''Freakonomics'' and Pop-Eleches \"are saying the same thing\":\n{{quote|Here is the abstract of the version of the Pop-Eleches paper that we cited:\n\n{{quote|\u2026Children born after the abortion ban attained more years of schooling and greater labor market success. This is because urban, educated women were more likely to have abortions prior to the policy change, and the relative number of children born to this type of woman increased after the ban. However, controlling for composition using observable background variables, children born after the ban on abortions had worse educational and labor market achievements as adults. Additionally, I provide evidence of crowding in the school system and some suggestive evidence that cohorts born after the introduction of the abortion ban had higher infant mortality and increased criminal behavior later in life.}}\n\nThe introduction of the Pop-Eleches paper says:\n\n{{quote|This finding is consistent with the view that children who were unwanted during pregnancy had worse socio-economic outcomes once they became adults.}}}}\n\n===Effects of extra police on crime===\n''Freakonomics'' claimed that it was possible to \"tease out\" the effect of extra police on crime by analysing electoral cycles. The evidence behind these claims was shown to be due partly to a programming error. McCrary stated \"While municipal police force size does appear to vary over state and local electoral cycles ... elections do not induce enough variation in police hiring to generate informative estimates of the effect of police on crime.\"{{r|jdinardo0}}\n\n===Defamation case===\nOn April 10, 2006, [[John Lott]] filed suit<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.overlawyered.com/lott_complaint.pdf/Lott%20v%20Levitt.pdf|title=PDF of Lott's complaint v.

Dubner]] claimed that the results of Lott's research in ''[[More Guns, Less Crime]]'' had not been replicated by other academics. In the emails to McCall, who had pointed to a number of papers in different academic publications that had replicated Lott's work, Levitt wrote that the work by authors supporting Lott in a special 2001 issue of ''[[The Journal of Law and Economics]]'' had not been peer reviewed, alleged that Lott had paid the University of Chicago Press to publish the papers, and that papers with results opposite of Lott's had been blocked from publication in that issue.<ref>{{Cite news|first=Michael |last=Higgins |title=Best-seller leads scholar to file lawsuit; Defamation allegation targets U. of C. author |publisher=Chicago Tribune |page=3 |date=2006-04-11}}</ref>\n\nA federal judge found that Levitt's replication claim in ''Freakonomics'' was not defamation but found merit in Lott's complaint over the email claims.<ref>\"[http://johnrlott.tripod.com/2007/01/judge-castillo-issues-decision-on-lott.html Judge Castillo issues decision on Lott v.

Modelling of these busts was performed by Carl Valerius, sculptor and stone mason of [[Harden\u2013Murrumburrah]], perhaps best known for his bronze statues at the Australian Light Horse Memorial in Harden\u2013Murrumburrah, notably the horse \"Bill the Bastard\", of which the full size version is expected to be completed in 2020.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.visithilltopsregion.com.au/carl-valerius/|title=Carl Valerius, Local Artist, Stone Mason & creator of Bill the Bastard statue |date=27 May 2019|publisher=Hilltops Council|access-date=23 September 2019}}</ref>\nThe nearby statue by Valerius<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.sothebysaustralia.com.au/lot/AU0822/126|title=A Life-size Hollow-cast Bronze Statue of Donald Bradman, By Carl Valerius |publisher=Sotheby's Australia|access-date=24 September 2019}} artist's copy, sold 7 April 2018 for $52,000 at public auction entitled Russell Crowe \u2014 Art of Divorce.</ref> (shown below) of Bradman in action was unveiled during the celebrations for \"Sir Don\"'s 92nd Birthday in August 2000.<ref>{{cite web|title=Cricket Captains' Walk|url=http://monumentaustralia.org.au/themes/culture/sport/display/20906-cricket-captains%60-walk |publisher=Monuments Australia|access-date=23 September 2019}}</ref>\nA minor mystery surrounds the Brian Booth sculpture, similar in style to others by Valerius, but not credited in the official documentation. There is no obvious clue in the plaques, which have been commendably uniform in style and execution over 30 years.\n*Stage 2, comprising the remaining 30 captains, was unveiled by the sculptor [[Tom Bass (sculptor)|Tom Bass]] on 27 August 2008, the centenary of Bradman's birth barely a kilometre away. Much of this work was performed by Bass and his team. His bust of Bradman was unveiled by the cricketer's grandson, Tom Bradman.<ref>From details on \"diptych\" plaque at entrance to Walk (pictured in \"Gallery\" directly above)</ref>\n*Stage 3, unveiled on 12 March 2020, brought the walk up-to-date with the unveiling of three new busts - Shane Watson, Steve Smith and Tim Paine and a plaque for Michael Clarke, who was mid-career when the second tranche of busts were commissioned. All three were made by the Tom Bass sculpture studio.\n\n==The busts==\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!

This position was not endorsed by the [[Modern Orthodox Judaism|Modern Orthodox]]. Rabbi [[Joseph Soloveitchik]] of [[Yeshiva University]] had initially aligned himself with Agudah, but later established his independent views on these matters and a host of other issues, such as attitudes towards college education and attitudes towards the secular-led Israeli governments. Rabbi Soloveitchik felt it important to nurture the modern Orthodox [[Rabbinical Council of America]] (RCA). However, at times, some of the more traditionalist rabbis at Yeshiva University aligned themselves with Agudah's positions.{{Citation needed|date=April 2015}}\n\nIn 2015, Agudah denounced moves to ordain women, and went even further, declaring [[Yeshivat Maharat]], [[Open Orthodoxy]], [[Yeshivat Chovevei Torah]], and other affiliated entities to be similar to other dissident movements throughout Jewish history in having rejected basic tenets of Judaism.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://hamodia.com/2015/11/03/moetzes-open-orthodoxy-not-a-form-of-torah-judaism/|title=Moetzes: \u2018Open Orthodoxy\u2019 Not a Form of Torah Judaism|work=Hamodia}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.jpost.com/Diaspora/Breach-in-US-Orthodox-Judaism-grows-as-haredi-body-rejects-Open-Orthodoxy-institutions-431929|title=Breach in US Orthodox Judaism grows as haredi body rejects \u2018Open Orthodoxy\u2019 institutions|work=The Jerusalem Post - JPost.com}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://forward.com/news/323887/agudath-rabbis-declare-war-on-open-orthodoxy/|title=Avi Weiss Defends 'Open Orthodoxy' as Agudah Rabbis Declare War|author=Josh Nathan-Kazis|date=3 November 2015|work=The Forward}}</ref>\n\nWhile Agudath does not consider itself as Zionist, it is generally supportive of the State of Israel insofar as it supports participation in its politics and the development of religious life, as well as the security of its population.

The film takes place several days before Christmas and tells the story of a group of sorority sisters who are stalked and murdered in their house during a winter storm. It is a loose [[remake]] of the 1974 [[Black Christmas (1974 film)|film of the same name]]. A co-production of Canada and the United States, the film was produced by Morgan and [[James Wong (producer)|James Wong]] through their production company Hard Eight Pictures, along with [[2929 Productions]], Adelstein-Parouse Productions and Hoban Segal Productions. It is the second film in the [[Black Christmas (film series)|''Black Christmas'' series]].\n\nDirector Glen Morgan signed on to write and direct the film after the release of his 2003 remake of ''[[Willard (2003 film)|Willard]]''. Shooting took place in [[Vancouver]], British Columbia, in 2005. The film was co-distributed by [[Dimension Films]] and [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]]. According to Morgan, he and Wong had numerous disputes with Dimension executives [[Bob Weinstein|Bob]] and [[Harvey Weinstein]] regarding the tone of the script as well as the film's conclusion, which resulted in numerous re-writes and re-shoots.\n\nIn December 2006, upon anticipation of its release, the film garnered criticism from [[Religious denomination|religious groups]] due to its depiction of graphic content in a holiday setting, as well as the distributor's decision to release the film on [[Christmas Day]] in the United States. The film opened in the United Kingdom on December 15, 2006, and, premiered at [[Grauman's Chinese Theatre]] in Los Angeles, California on December 19. Despite backlash from some religious organizations, ''Black Christmas'' was released in the United States on December 25, 2006. The film received negative reviews from critics, and grossed $21.5 million worldwide on a budget of $9 million.\n\nThis is the final film to be composed by [[Shirley Walker]] before her death on November 30, 2006, a month before the film's release.\n\n==Plot==\n[[Billy (Black Christmas)|Billy Edward Lenz]], a boy born with severe [[jaundice]], is constantly abused by his hateful mother, Constance. With the help of her lover, Constance murders Billy's father, Frank, on [[Christmas Eve]] 1975 and buries his body in the house's crawlspace. To prevent Billy from talking, she imprisons him in the attic. Years later, Constance attempts to conceive another child, but realizes that her boyfriend is [[impotence|impotent]]. She goes to the attic and rapes twelve-year-old Billy. Nine months later, Constance gives birth to their daughter, Agnes. Constance uses the occasion of Agnes' birth to further reject Billy, and her boyfriend believes he fathered Agnes. On [[Christmas Day]] 1991, Billy escapes from the attic and disfigures eight-year-old Agnes by gouging out her eye. He then brutally murders his mother and her lover. He is caught by police [[Cannibalism|eating cookies made out of his mother's flesh]], and is sent to a mental asylum.\n\nFifteen years later, on Christmas Eve, Billy, now 35, escapes from his cell and heads to his former home, now a sorority house for Delta Alpha Kappa at [[Lists of fictional locations|Clemson University]] outside [[Boston]]. At the house, Clair Crosby, one of the sorority girls, is murdered in her bedroom by an unknown figure. Meanwhile, Megan Helms begins to hear noises and goes up to the attic to investigate. Upon finding Clair's body in a rocking chair, Megan is attacked and killed by the same assailant. In the living room, the other sorority sisters, Kelli Presley, Melissa Kitt, Heather Fitzgerald, Dana Mathis and Lauren Hannon, along with their housemother Mrs. Mac, receive a threatening call from a stranger. Clair's half-sister Leigh Colvin soon arrives, searching for her. The withdrawn Eve Agnew presents Heather with a glass unicorn before leaving the sorority house to go home for the holidays. Meanwhile, Kelli's boyfriend, Kyle Autry, arrives but is kicked out when Kelli discovers a video of him and Megan having sex. When the lights suddenly go out, Dana goes to check the power under the house, but encounters the figure in the crawlspace and is dragged underneath and killed with a [[garden fork]]. The girls in the house subsequently receive an indecipherable call from Dana's cell phone. Outside while searching for Dana, they find Eve's severed head in her car.\n\nWith the police unable to arrive in time due to a snow storm, Kelli, Melissa and Leigh decide to stay inside the house whilst Heather and Mrs. Mac flee. In the car, Heather is murdered, and Mrs. Mac is impaled by a falling icicle. While Kelli and Leigh descend to the garage to investigate, Melissa is attacked and killed by the assailant with a pair of ice skates. Kelli and Leigh return upstairs and find Lauren's eyeless corpse in bed. Kyle returns to the house, and the three go to investigate the attic; while ascending the ladder, Kyle is dragged into the attic to his death. The killer is revealed to be Agnes, now an adult; Kelli and Leigh watch in horror as Billy appears in the attic as well. Agnes and Billy attack Kelli, knocking all three of them into the empty space between the walls of the house. Leigh helps Kelli escape before they start a fire, leaving Billy and Agnes to burn to death. Later, Kelli and Leigh recover at the hospital. Billy, who is partially burned, kills the morgue assistant. While Kelli goes for an x-ray, Agnes (also survived) appears in her hospital room and kills Leigh. When Kelli returns to her room, Agnes appears through the ceiling and attacks her, but Kelli uses a defibrillator and violently electrocutes Agnes, killing her. Moments later, Billy enters through the ceiling and chases Kelli to the stairwell. They briefly fight, ending with Kelli pushing Billy off the railing where he is subsequently impaled on the tip of a Christmas tree, finally killing him.

The film takes place several days before Christmas and tells the story of a group of sorority sisters who are stalked and murdered in their house during a winter storm. It is a loose [[remake]] of the 1974 [[Black Christmas (1974 film)|film of the same name]]. A co-production of Canada and the United States, the film was produced by Morgan and [[James Wong (producer)|James Wong]] through their production company Hard Eight Pictures, along with [[2929 Productions]], Adelstein-Parouse Productions and Hoban Segal Productions. It is the second film in the [[Black Christmas (film series)|''Black Christmas'' series]].\n\nDirector Glen Morgan signed on to write and direct the film after the release of his 2003 remake of ''[[Willard (2003 film)|Willard]]''. Shooting took place in [[Vancouver]], British Columbia, in 2005. The film was co-distributed by [[Dimension Films]] and [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]]. According to Morgan, he and Wong had numerous disputes with Dimension executives [[Bob Weinstein|Bob]] and [[Harvey Weinstein]] regarding the tone of the script as well as the film's conclusion, which resulted in numerous re-writes and re-shoots.\n\nIn December 2006, upon anticipation of its release, the film garnered criticism from [[Religious denomination|religious groups]] due to its depiction of graphic content in a holiday setting, as well as the distributor's decision to release the film on [[Christmas Day]] in the United States. The film opened in the United Kingdom on December 15, 2006, and, premiered at [[Grauman's Chinese Theatre]] in Los Angeles, California on December 19. Despite backlash from some religious organizations, ''Black Christmas'' was released in the United States on December 25, 2006. The film received negative reviews from critics, and grossed $21.5 million worldwide on a budget of $9 million.\n\nThis is the final film to be composed by [[Shirley Walker]] before her death on November 30, 2006, a month before the film's release.\n\n==Plot==\n[[Billy (Black Christmas)|Billy Edward Lenz]], a boy born with severe [[jaundice]], is constantly abused by his hateful mother, Constance. With the help of her lover, Constance murders Billy's father, Frank, on [[Christmas Eve]] 1975 and buries his body in the house's crawlspace. To prevent Billy from talking, she imprisons him in the attic. Years later, Constance attempts to conceive another child, but realizes that her boyfriend is [[impotence|impotent]]. She goes to the attic and rapes twelve-year-old Billy. Nine months later, Constance gives birth to their daughter, Agnes. Constance uses the occasion of Agnes' birth to further reject Billy, and her boyfriend believes he fathered Agnes. On [[Christmas Day]] 1991, Billy escapes from the attic and disfigures eight-year-old Agnes by gouging out her eye. He then brutally murders his mother and her lover. He is caught by police [[Cannibalism|eating cookies made out of his mother's flesh]], and is sent to a mental asylum.\n\nFifteen years later, on Christmas Eve, Billy, now 35, escapes from his cell and heads to his former home, now a sorority house for Delta Alpha Kappa at [[Lists of fictional locations|Clemson University]] outside [[Boston]]. At the house, Clair Crosby, one of the sorority girls, is murdered in her bedroom by an unknown figure. Meanwhile, Megan Helms begins to hear noises and goes up to the attic to investigate. Upon finding Clair's body in a rocking chair, Megan is attacked and killed by the same assailant. In the living room, the other sorority sisters, Kelli Presley, Melissa Kitt, Heather Fitzgerald, Dana Mathis and Lauren Hannon, along with their housemother Mrs. Mac, receive a threatening call from a stranger. Clair's half-sister Leigh Colvin soon arrives, searching for her. The withdrawn Eve Agnew presents Heather with a glass unicorn before leaving the sorority house to go home for the holidays. Meanwhile, Kelli's boyfriend, Kyle Autry, arrives but is kicked out when Kelli discovers a video of he and Megan having sex. When the lights suddenly go out, Dana goes to check the power under the house, but encounters the figure in the crawlspace and is dragged underneath and killed with a [[garden fork]]. The girls in the house subsequently receive an indecipherable call from Dana's cell phone. Outside while searching for Dana, they find Eve's severed head in her car.\n\nWith the police unable to arrive in time due to a snow storm, Kelli, Melissa and Leigh decide to stay inside the house whilst Heather and Mrs. Mac flee. In the car, Heather is murdered, and Mrs. Mac is impaled by a falling icicle. While Kelli and Leigh descend to the garage to investigate, Melissa is attacked and killed by the assailant with a pair of ice skates. Kelli and Leigh return upstairs and find Lauren's eyeless corpse in bed. Kyle returns to the house, and the three go to investigate the attic; while ascending the ladder, Kyle is dragged into the attic to his death. The killer is revealed to be Agnes, now an adult; Kelli and Leigh watch in horror as Billy appears in the attic as well. Agnes and Billy attack Kelli, knocking all three of them into the empty space between the walls of the house. Leigh helps Kelli escape before they start a fire, leaving Billy and Agnes to burn to death. Later, Kelli and Leigh recover at the hospital. Billy, who is partially burned, kills the morgue assistant. While Kelli goes for an x-ray, Agnes (also survived) appears in her hospital room and kills Leigh. When Kelli returns to her room, Agnes appears through the ceiling and attacks her, but Kelli uses a defibrillator and violently electrocutes Agnes, killing her. Moments later, Billy enters through the ceiling and chases Kelli to the stairwell.

Their deep antipathy towards the police for arresting them without any evidence, just because the witnesses had seen an Indian at the crime scene, grows into a daring plot. Sparked off by \"Ajju\" ([[Sanjay Dutt]]) and seconded by \"Major\" ([[Amitabh Bachchan]]), they all hatch a plan to rob the bank in which lies the funding for the Los Angeles Police Department. In return, Ajju reveals that he stole the truck and splits the steal with everyone else.\n\nMarc ([[Suniel Shetty]]) is a bouncer who hates that his girlfriend has to work as a club-dancer and wants to rescue her from the club owner Cyrus ([[Gulshan Grover]]), by paying him the required money. He also has an ongoing spat with Ajju about his girlfriend. Major has a sick wife who he has to look after by supplying her with medicines and injections. Andy ([[Kumar Gaurav]]) is a software engineer having divorce and custody troubles, as his wife won't let him meet their child. Bali ([[Mahesh Manjrekar]]) and Mak ([[Lucky Ali]]) are two drug-peddlers who live off the street selling and buying illicit drugs under a drug lord. They meet when Bali is being chased by some drug dealers and meets Mak in an alley where he is adjusting something in his car. He agrees to save him only if he splits his loot. They agree to work on this method from that time on.\n\nAll six meet on a hotel roof-top where they construct their plan and arrange for arms, ammunition, vehicles, and gadgets. They do some reconnaissance around the bank and two days before the robbery, Major surprises everyone by declaring that the robbery will take place the next day.\n\nWhile the robbery happens as planned, they find a SWAT team waiting for them outside the bank. They are engaged in gunfight and Mak is hit by a bullet while saving Major. They all escape and meet at their hideout. They realise that someone might have informed the police, which could reach their hideout as well. Mak, who was hit, is not allowed to be taken to the hospital, and Major treats his wound with some [[Whiskey]]. They all have verbal scuffles after which, Ajju, reveals that he has kidnapped the Police Chief. They interrogate him and learn that one of them is an undercover cop. This strikes terror among them and they decide to bring the stolen amount to their hideout. Major finds out that his wife has died. Ajju befriends Marc and tells him to elope with his girlfriend. When they return, they find Bali dead, killed by Mak for being inhuman in his interrogation of the Police Chief. Ajju reasons that Mak is the undercover cop, but Major disagrees because he believes Mak saved him during the gunfight at the bank. They all arrive at a [[Mexican stand-off]], with Andy as the viewer. He retreats and runs away with the money. They all shoot at each other, after which Major apologizes to Mak for not saving him.

and starring an [[ensemble cast]] including [[Amitabh Bachchan]], [[Sanjay Dutt]], Rishabh Chaturvedi, [[Sunil Shetty]], [[Lucky Ali]], [[Mahesh Manjrekar]], [[Kumar Gaurav]], [[Namrata Singh Gujral]], [[Rati Agnihotri]] and [[Malaika Arora]]. Set in [[Los Angeles]], the film follows six Indian men who are detained without evidence by the police. Feeling wronged and vengeful, they team up to plot a bank heist that would leave the Los Angeles Police Department penniless. However, once things go out of hand, they start suspecting each other's identities, resulting in violence and chaos.\n\n''Kaante'' was heavily inspired by [[Quentin Tarantino]]'s ''[[Reservoir Dogs]]'' (1992) as well as the film that inspired it, [[Ringo Lam]]'s ''[[City on Fire (1987 film)|City on Fire]]'' (1987).<ref name=\"Rediff 2002 Interview\">{{cite news|url=http://www.rediff.com/entertai/2002/jul/27gupta.htm|title=Movies: An interview with Sanjay Gupta|date=July 27, 2002|work=[[Rediff]]|accessdate=16 November 2014}}</ref> According to Tarantino, ''Kaante'' is his favorite among the many films that were heavily inspired by his work.<ref name=\"tarantino\">{{cite news|author=[[Subhash K.

Their deep antipathy towards the police for arresting them without any evidence, just because the witnesses had seen an Indian at the crime scene, grows into a daring plot. Sparked off by \"Ajju\" ([[Sanjay Dutt]]) and seconded by \"Major\" ([[Amitabh Bachchan]]), they all hatch a plan to rob the bank in which lies the funding for the Los Angeles Police Department. In return, Ajju reveals that he stole the truck and splits the steal with everyone else.\n\nMarc ([[Suniel Shetty]]) is a bouncer who hates that his girlfriend has to work as a club-dancer and wants to rescue her from the club owner Cyrus ([[Gulshan Grover]]), by paying him the required money. He also has an ongoing spat with Ajju about his girlfriend. Major has a sick wife who he has to look after by supplying her with medicines and injections. Andy ([[Kumar Gaurav]]) is a software engineer having divorce and custody troubles, as his wife won't let him meet their child. Bali ([[Mahesh Manjrekar]]) and Mak ([[Lucky Ali]]) are two drug-peddlers who live off the street selling and buying illicit drugs under a drug lord. They meet when Bali is being chased by some drug dealers and meets Mak in an alley where he is adjusting something in his car. He agrees to save him only if he splits his loot. They agree to work on this method from that time on.\n\nAll six meet on a hotel roof-top where they construct their plan and arrange for arms, ammunition, vehicles, and gadgets. They do some reconnaissance around the bank and two days before the robbery, Major surprises everyone by declaring that the robbery will take place the next day.\n\nWhile the robbery happens as planned, they find a SWAT team waiting for them outside the bank. They are engaged in gunfight and Mak is hit by a bullet while saving Major. They all escape and meet at their hideout. They realise that someone might have informed the police, which could reach their hideout as well. Mak, who was hit, is not allowed to be taken to the hospital, and Major treats his wound with some [[Whiskey]]. They all have verbal scuffles after which, Ajju, reveals that he has kidnapped the Police Chief. They interrogate him and learn that one of them is an undercover cop. This strikes terror among them and they decide to bring the stolen amount to their hideout. Major finds out that his wife has died. Ajju befriends Marc and tells him to elope with his girlfriend. When they return, they find Bali dead, killed by Mak for being inhuman in his interrogation of the Police Chief. Ajju reasons that Mak is the undercover cop, but Major disagrees because he believes Mak saved him during the gunfight at the bank. They all arrive at a [[Mexican stand-off]], with Andy as the viewer. He retreats and runs away with the money. They all shoot at each other, after which Major apologizes to Mak for not saving him. In reply, Mak apologizes saying he was just doing his duty as he is the Police-member. Major realises his mistake and shoots the already dying Mak in the head. Marc's girlfriend is shown waiting for him at the airport and Andy is shown at the end driving off the highway pursued by a Police helicopter, leaving the end to the discretion of audience followed by ending credits.\n\n== Cast ==\n* [[Amitabh Bachchan]] as Yashvardhan \"Major\" Rampal\n* [[Sanjay Dutt]] as Jay \"Ajju\" Rehan\n* [[Suniel Shetty]] as Marc Issak\n* [[Mahesh Manjrekar]] as Raj \"Bali\" Yadav\n* [[Kumar Gaurav]] as Anand \"Andy\" Mathur\n* [[Lucky Ali]] as Maqbool \"Mak\" Haider\n* [[Malaika Arora]] as Lisa\n* [[Ranjit Chowdhry]] as McQuarrie's Partner\n*  Sanjay Sippy as Mr. Adler\n* [[Rati Agnihotri]] as Major's Wife\n* [[Gulshan Grover]] as Cyrus\n* Jeff Davis as Det.
