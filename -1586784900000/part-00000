He cited the increase in anti-Semitism worldwide in recent years as generating a \"need to understand the current manifestation of this disease\".<ref>''[http://www.iht.com/articles/ap/2006/09/19/america/NA_GEN_US_Yale_Anti_Semitism.php Yale creates center to study anti-Semitism] Associated Press, September 19, 2006''</ref>\n\nIn August 2010 in New Haven, Small was elected as the President of the newly formed International Association for the Study of Antisemitism (IASA).\n\nSmall was one of a number of academics who submitted evidence to the British All-Party Parliamentary Inquiry into Antisemitism. He was also an expert for the Canadian All-Party Parliamentary Inquiry into Antisemitism. Charles Asher Small convened an historical conference at the Vatican in September 2017.  The ISGAP-Vatican Conference entitled \"Antisemitism and Minority Rights in the Middle East: Regional and International Implications\".

Kaplan|Edward Kaplan]] demonstrated that Europeans who hold deeply anti-Israeli views are  more likely to also have classic anti-Semitic opinions by a significant margin.  Looking at populations in 10 European countries, Small and Kaplan surveyed 5,000 respondents, asking them about Israeli actions and classical anti-Semitic stereotypes. \"There were questions about whether the IDF purposely targets children, whether Israel poisons the Palestinians' water supply - these sorts of extreme mythologies,\" Small says.  They demonstrated that Europeans whose opinions are extremely anti-Israel, are highly likely to also be anti-Semitic. \"The people who believed the anti-Israel mythologies also tended to believe that Jews are not honest in business, have dual loyalties, control government and the economy, and the like,\" Small says. The study demonstrated that an Israel-hating European is 56% more likely to be anti-Semitic than the average European.  \"This is extraordinary.

Small is committed to creating scholarly programming and research on contemporary anti-semitism at top tier universities internationally, and establishing contemporary antisemitism studies as a recognized academic discipline.\n\nBorn in Montreal, Quebec, Canada, he has a [[Doctor of Philosophy|D.Phil.]] from [[Oxford University]], and has taught at the [[University of London]], [[Ben Gurion University]], [[Tel Aviv University]], and [[Hebrew University]].  Small was also the Koret Distinguished Scholar, Hoover Institution, Stanford University. He was the Director/Associate Professor of [[Urban Studies]] at [[Southern Connecticut State University]].

He also spoke as an expert on anti-Semitism at the Australian, British, Canadian, Chilean and Italian Parliaments, the German Bundestag, and at the United Nations, Geneva and in New York.\n\nOn September 19, 2006, Yale University founded The Yale Initiative for the Interdisciplinary Study of Antisemitism [http://www.yale.edu/isps/seminars/antisemitism/index.html], the first North American university-based center for study of the subject, housed at the Institute for Social and Policy Studies, with Small as director and founder. He cited the increase in anti-Semitism worldwide in recent years as generating a \"need to understand the current manifestation of this disease\".<ref>''[http://www.iht.com/articles/ap/2006/09/19/america/NA_GEN_US_Yale_Anti_Semitism.php Yale creates center to study anti-Semitism] Associated Press, September 19, 2006''</ref>\n\nIn August 2010 in New Haven, Small was elected as the President of the newly formed International Association for the Study of Antisemitism (IASA).\n\nSmall was one of a number of academics who submitted evidence to the British All-Party Parliamentary Inquiry into Antisemitism. He was also an expert for the Canadian All-Party Parliamentary Inquiry into Antisemitism. Charles Asher Small convened an historical conference at the Vatican in September 2017.  The ISGAP-Vatican Conference entitled \"Antisemitism and Minority Rights in the Middle East: Regional and International Implications\".   The international conference brought together scholars from around the world - Christian, Muslim, Copts, Bahai, Jewish, Catholic thinkers, as well as humans rights activists and policy makers including the British former Prime Minister Tony Blair.\n\nCharles Asher Small is a human rights activist and was the Chairperson of the African National Congress Solidarity Committee of Canada; the Chairperson of the Student Struggle for Soviet Jewry, and worked with the First Nations of Canada.\n\n==Study of Antisemitism==\nCharles Asher Small and his colleagues at ISGAP have been at the forefront of ensuring that the scholars deal with issues of contemporary antisemitism at the academic level, around the world.\n\n== Contributions ==\nIn a path-breaking article entitled \"Anti-Israel Sentiment Predicts Anti-Semitism in Europe,\"[http://jcr.sagepub.com/content/50/4/548.short] in The Journal of Conflict Resolution, Small and Yale's Prof. [[Edward H. Kaplan|Edward Kaplan]] demonstrated that Europeans who hold deeply anti-Israeli views are  more likely to also have classic anti-Semitic opinions by a significant margin.  Looking at populations in 10 European countries, Small and Kaplan surveyed 5,000 respondents, asking them about Israeli actions and classical anti-Semitic stereotypes. \"There were questions about whether the IDF purposely targets children, whether Israel poisons the Palestinians' water supply - these sorts of extreme mythologies,\" Small says.  They demonstrated that Europeans whose opinions are extremely anti-Israel, are highly likely to also be anti-Semitic. \"The people who believed the anti-Israel mythologies also tended to believe that Jews are not honest in business, have dual loyalties, control government and the economy, and the like,\" Small says. The study demonstrated that an Israel-hating European is 56% more likely to be anti-Semitic than the average European.  \"This is extraordinary. It's off the charts,\" says Small. \"If a food or a drug was 56% more likely to cause cancer, it would be taken off the shelf.\"<ref>Yale expert: Not enough known about anti-Semitism, Aug. 8, 2007, Haviv Rettig Gur , ''The Jerusalem Post'' [http://fr.jpost.com/servlet/Satellite?cid=1186557401345&pagename=JPost%2FJPArticle%2FPrinter]</ref>\n\n== Books ==\n* The ISGAP Papers: Antisemitism in Comparative Perspective, 2018, ISGAP, New York\n* The ISGAP Papers: Antisemitism in Comparative Perspective, 2016, ISGAP, New York\n* The Yale Papers: Antisemitism in Comparative Perspective, 2015, ISGAP, New York\n* Global Antisemitism: A Crisis of Modernity An Introduction, 2014, New York\n* Global Antisemitism: A Crisis of Modernity, ISGAP Publishers, 2013 VI Volume, New York. \n* Global Antisemitism: A Crisis of Modernity, Brill Press, Amsterdam, 2013.\n* Social Theory - an Historical Analysis of Canadian Socio-Cultural Policies, 'Race' and The 'Other': A Case Study of Social and Spatial Segregation in Montreal, Eleven International Publishing, Amsterdam, 2013.\n* Charles Asher Small, Olufemi Vaughan and M.

Australian Open final|publisher=USA Today|accessdate=11 September 2016}}</ref> en route to her first [[WTA Premier tournaments|WTA Premier 5]] final at the [[2012 Western & Southern Open|Western & Southern Open]].\n\nBetween 2013 and 2014, she made a second consecutive semifinal appearance at the [[2013 BNP Paribas Open|BNP Paribas Open]], reached another two WTA Premier 5 finals in [[2013 Toray Pan Pacific Open|Tokyo]] and [[2014 Qatar Total Open|Doha]] and advanced to her second quarterfinal at [[2014 Wimbledon Championships|Wimbledon]] after defeating Sharapova in a tight three set match in the fourth round. 2015 saw Kerber reverse her previous season's 0\u20134 record in singles finals by winning 4 titles including her maiden titles on [[Clay court|clay]] and grass at the [[2015 Family Circle Cup|Family Circle Cup]] and [[2015 Aegon Classic|Aegon Classic]].\n\nKerber began [[2016 WTA Tour|2016]] with a finals appearance at the [[2016 Brisbane International|Brisbane International]] before claiming her first win over Azarenka en route to her first major final at the [[2016 Australian Open|Australian Open]], where she overcame Serena Williams in three sets to win her maiden grand slam singles title. As a result, she prevented Williams from surpassing [[Steffi Graf]]'s [[Open Era (tennis)|Open Era]] record of 22 grand slam singles titles and ascended to a new career high of world No. 2. In April, she successfully defended her title at the [[2016 Porsche Tennis Grand Prix|Porsche Tennis Grand Prix]] before rebounding from her first round loss at the [[2016 French Open|French Open]] with a runner-up finish at the [[2016 Wimbledon Championships|Wimbledon Championships]]. After beginning her [[2016 US Open Series|US Open Series]] with a new career-best semifinal appearance at the [[2016 Rogers Cup|Rogers Cup]], Kerber reached back-to-back finals at the [[Tennis at the 2016 Summer Olympics|2016 Rio de Janeiro Olympics]] and [[2016 Western & Southern Open|Western & Southern Open]]. At the [[2016 US Open (tennis)|US Open]], Kerber avenged her straight sets loss to [[Karol\u00edna Pl\u00ed\u0161kov\u00e1]] in Cincinnati by defeating the Czech in a three set final to win her first title at the event and second grand slam singles title overall. With the victory and Pl\u00ed\u0161kov\u00e1's win over the defending champion Serena Williams in the semifinals, Kerber became the [[List of WTA number 1 ranked singles players|world No. 1]] for the first time in her career. She also became the second female player ever to earn 10&nbsp;million&nbsp;$ in a season.\n\nIn 2018, Kerber beat Serena Williams to win her first Wimbledon title and third Grand Slam tournament title. She finished that year as world number&nbsp;2.\n\n==Performance timelines==\n{{Performance key}}\n===Singles===\n''Only results  in WTA Tour (incl.

Dubai was classified as a Premier 5 event from 2009\u20132011 before being succeeded by Doha for the 2012\u20132014 period. In 2015, Dubai regained its Premier 5 status while Doha was demoted to Premier status.

{"title_page": "Balanced line", "text_new": "{{Redirect|Balanced|other uses|Balance (disambiguation)}}\nIn [[telecommunication]]s and [[professional audio]], a '''balanced line''' or '''balanced signal pair''' is a [[transmission line]] consisting of two conductors of the same type, each of which have equal [[Electrical impedance|impedances]] along their lengths and equal impedances to [[Ground (electricity)|ground]] and to other circuits.<ref>Young EC, ''The Penguin Dictionary of Electronics'', 1988, {{ISBN|0-14-051187-3}}</ref> The chief advantage of the balanced line format is good rejection of external noise when fed to a [[differential amplifier]].{{Citation needed|date=October 2018}} Common forms of balanced line are [[twin-lead]], used for radio frequency signals and [[twisted pair]], used for lower frequencies. They are to be contrasted to [[unbalanced line]]s, such as [[coaxial cable]], which is designed to have its return conductor connected to [[ground (electricity)|ground]], or circuits whose return conductor actually is ground. [[Balanced circuit|Balanced]] and [[unbalanced circuit]]s can be interconnected using a [[transformer]] called a [[balun]].\n\nCircuits driving balanced lines must themselves be balanced to maintain the benefits of balance. This may be achieved by [[repeating coil|transformer]] coupling or by merely balancing the impedance in each conductor.\n\nLines carrying symmetric signals (those with equal but opposite voltages to ground on each leg) are often incorrectly referred to as \"balanced\", but this is actually [[differential signaling]].  Balanced lines and differential signaling are often used together, but they are not the same thing.  Differential signalling does not make a line balanced, nor does noise rejection in balanced cables require differential signalling.\n\n== Explanation ==\n[[File:Twisted pair.svg|thumb|250px|'''Fig. 1.'''

This line is intended for use with RF circuits, particularly antennae.]]\nTransmission of a signal over a balanced line reduces the influence of noise or interference due to external stray electric fields. Any external signal sources tend to [[Faraday's law of induction|induce]] only a [[Common-mode interference|common mode signal]] on the line, and the balanced [[Electrical impedance|impedance]]s to ground minimizes differential pickup due to stray electric fields. The conductors are sometimes [[Twisted pair|twisted together]] to ensure that each conductor is equally exposed to any external magnetic fields that could induce unwanted noise.\n\nSome balanced lines also have [[electrostatic shielding]] to reduce the amount of noise introduced. The cable is often wrapped in foil, copper wire, or a copper braid. This shield provides immunity to RF interference but does not provide immunity to magnetic fields.\n\nSome balanced lines use 4-conductor [[star quad cable]] to provide immunity to magnetic fields. The geometry of the cable ensures that magnetic fields will cause equal interference of both legs of the balanced circuit. This balanced interference is a common-mode signal that can easily be removed by a transformer or balanced differential receiver.<ref>''[http://benchmarkmedia.com/blogs/application_notes/116637511-the-importance-of-star-quad-microphone-cable The Importance of Star-Quad Microphone Cable]''</ref><ref>''[http://www.canare.com/UploadedDocuments/A%20Technical%20Paper%20-%20Evaluating%20Microphone%20Cable%20Perfrmance%20and%20Specifications.pdf Evaluating Microphone Cable Performance & Specifications]''</ref><ref>''[http://www.canare.com/UploadedDocuments/Cat11_p35.pdf The Star Quad Story]''</ref><ref>''[https://www.soundonsound.com/sos/nov09/articles/qa1109_4.htm What's Special About Star-Quad Cable?]''</ref><ref>''[http://www.belden.com/blog/broadcastav/How-Starquad-Works.cfm How Starquad Works]''</ref>\n\nA balanced line allows a [[Differential signaling|differential receiver]] to reduce the [[noise]] on a connection by rejecting [[common-mode interference]]. The lines have the same [[Electrical impedance|impedance]] to ground, so the interfering fields or currents induce the same voltage in both wires. Since the receiver responds only to the difference between the wires, it is not influenced by the induced noise voltage. If balanced line is used in an unbalanced circuit, with different impedances from each conductor to ground, currents induced in the separate conductors will cause different voltage drops to ground, thus creating a voltage differential, making the line more susceptible to noise. Examples of twisted pairs include [[category 5 cable]].\n\nCompared to unbalanced circuits, balanced lines reduce the amount of noise per distance, allowing a longer cable run to be practical. This is because electromagnetic interference will affect both signals the same way. Similarities between the two signals are automatically removed at the end of the transmission path when one signal is subtracted from the other.\n\n==Telephone systems==\nThe first application for balanced lines was for telephone lines. Interference that was of little consequence on a telegraph system (which is in essence digital) could be very disturbing for a telephone user. The initial format was to take two single-wire unbalanced telegraph lines and use them as a pair. This proved insufficient, however, with the growth of electric power transmission which tended to use the same routes. A telephone line running alongside a power line for many miles will inevitably have more interference induced in one leg than the other since one of them will be nearer to the power line. This issue was addressed by swapping the positions of the two legs every few hundred yards with a cross-over, thus ensuring that both legs had equal interference induced and allowing common-mode rejection to do its work. As the telephone system grew, it became preferable to use cable rather than open wires to save space, and also to avoid poor performance during bad weather. The cable construction used for balanced telephone cables was [[twisted pair]]; however, this did not become widespread until repeater amplifiers became available. For an unamplified telephone line, a twisted pair cable could only manage a maximum distance of 30&nbsp;km. Open wires, on the other hand, with their lower capacitance, had been used for enormous distances\u2014the longest was the 1500&nbsp;km from New York to Chicago built in 1893. [[Loading coils]] were used to improve the distance achievable with cable but the problem was not finally overcome until amplifiers started to be installed in 1912.<ref name=\"Huurdeman\">{{cite book |last1=Huurdeman |first1=Anton A. |title=The Worldwide History of Telecommunications |date=July 2003 |publisher=Wiley-IEEE Press |isbn=978-0-471-20505-0 |url=https://www.wiley.com/en-us/The+Worldwide+History+of+Telecommunications-p-9780471205050}}</ref>{{rp|323}} Twisted pair balanced lines are still widely used for [[local loop]]s, the lines that connect each subscriber's premises to their respective [[Telephone exchange|exchange]].<ref name=\"Huurdeman\" />{{rp|314-316}}\n\nTelephone [[trunk line]]s, and especially [[frequency division multiplexing]] carrier systems, are usually 4-wire circuits rather than 2-wire circuits (or at least they were before [[fiber-optic|fibre-optic]] became widespread) and require a different kind of cable. This format requires the conductors to be arranged in two pairs, one pair for the sending (go) signal and the other for the return signal. The greatest source of interference on this kind of transmission is usually the crosstalk between the go and return circuits themselves. The most common cable format is [[star quad]], where the diagonally opposite conductors form the pairs. This geometry gives maximum common mode rejection between the two pairs. An alternative format is DM (Dieselhorst-Martin) quad which consists of two twisted pairs with the twisting at different pitches.<ref name=\"Huurdeman\" />{{rp|320}}\n\n== Audio systems ==\n{{Main|Balanced audio}}\n[[File:Star quad microphone.svg|thumb|'''Fig. 5.''' Microphones connected to [[star quad cable]] join together diametrically opposite conductors to maintain balance. This is different from the usage on 4-wire circuits. The colours in this diagram correspond with the colouring in figure 2.]]\nAn example of balanced lines is the connection of [[microphone]]s to a mixer in professional systems. Classically, both dynamic and condenser microphones used [[transformer]]s to provide a differential-mode signal. While transformers are still used in the large majority of modern dynamic microphones, more recent condenser microphones are more likely to use electronic drive circuitry. Each leg, irrespective of any signal, should have an identical impedance to ground. Pair cable (or a pair-derivative such as [[Star quad cable|star quad]]) is used to maintain the balanced impedances and close twisting of the cores ensures that any interference is common to both conductors. Providing that the receiving end (usually a [[mixing console]]) does not disturb the line balance, and is able to ignore common-mode (noise) signals, and can extract differential ones, then the system will have excellent immunity to induced interference.\n\nTypical professional audio sources, such as microphones, have three-pin [[XLR connector]]s. One is the shield or chassis ground, while the other two are signal connections. These signal wires carry two copies of the same signal, but with opposite polarity. (They are often termed \"hot\" and \"cold,\" and the AES14-1992(r2004) Standard [and EIA Standard RS-297-A] suggest that the pin that carries the positive signal that results from a positive air pressure on a transducer will be deemed 'hot'. Pin 2 has been designated as the 'hot' pin, and that designation serves useful for keeping a consistent polarity in the rest of the system.) Since these conductors travel the same path from source to destination, the assumption is that any interference is induced upon both conductors equally. The appliance receiving the signals compares the difference between the two signals (often with disregard to electrical ground) allowing the appliance to ignore any induced electrical noise. Any induced noise would be present in equal amounts and in identical polarity on each of the balanced signal conductors, so the two signals\u2019 difference from each other would be unchanged. The successful rejection of induced noise from the desired signal depends in part on the balanced signal conductors receiving the same amount and type of interference. This typically leads to twisted, braided, or co-jacketed cables for use in balanced signal transmission.\n\n== Balanced and differential ==\n{{main|Balanced circuit}}\nMost explanations of balanced lines assume symmetric (antiphase) signals but this is an unfortunate confusion\u2014signal symmetry and balanced lines are quite independent of each other.

For example, baluns can be used to send [[line level]] audio or [[E-carrier level 1]] signals over coaxial cable (which is unbalanced) through {{convert|300|ft|m}} of [[category 5 cable]] by using a pair of baluns at each end of the CAT5 run. The balun takes the unbalanced signal, and creates an inverted copy of that signal. It then sends these 2 signals across the CAT5 cable as a balanced, differential signal. Upon reception at the other end, the balun takes the difference of the two signals, thus removing any noise picked up along the way and recreating the unbalanced signal.\n\nA once common application of a [[radio frequency]] balun was found at the antenna terminals of a [[television]] receiver.

[[Balanced circuit|Balanced]] and [[unbalanced circuit]]s can be interconnected using a [[transformer]] called a [[balun]].\n\nCircuits driving balanced lines must themselves be balanced to maintain the benefits of balance. This may be achieved by [[repeating coil|transformer]] coupling or by merely balancing the impedance in each conductor.\n\nLines carrying symmetric signals (those with equal but opposite voltages to ground on each leg) are often incorrectly referred to as \"balanced\", but this is actually [[differential signaling]].  Balanced lines and differential signaling are often used together, but they are not the same thing.  Differential signalling does not make a line balanced, nor does noise rejection in balanced cables require differential signalling.\n\n== Explanation ==\n[[File:Twisted pair.svg|thumb|250px|'''Fig. 1.'''

This line is intended for use with RF circuits, particularly antennae.]]\nTransmission of a signal over a balanced line reduces the influence of noise or interference due to external stray electric fields. Any external signal sources tend to [[Faraday's law of induction|induce]] only a [[Common-mode interference|common mode signal]] on the line, and the balanced [[Electrical impedance|impedance]]s to ground minimizes differential pickup due to stray electric fields. The conductors are sometimes [[Twisted pair|twisted together]] to ensure that each conductor is equally exposed to any external magnetic fields that could induce unwanted noise.\n\nSome balanced lines also have [[electrostatic shielding]] to reduce the amount of noise introduced. The cable is often wrapped in foil, copper wire, or a copper braid. This shield provides immunity to RF interference but does not provide immunity to magnetic fields.\n\nSome balanced lines use 4-conductor [[star quad cable]] to provide immunity to magnetic fields. The geometry of the cable ensures that magnetic fields will cause equal interference of both legs of the balanced circuit. This balanced interference is a common-mode signal that can easily be removed by a transformer or balanced differential receiver.<ref>''[http://benchmarkmedia.com/blogs/application_notes/116637511-the-importance-of-star-quad-microphone-cable The Importance of Star-Quad Microphone Cable]''</ref><ref>''[http://www.canare.com/UploadedDocuments/A%20Technical%20Paper%20-%20Evaluating%20Microphone%20Cable%20Perfrmance%20and%20Specifications.pdf Evaluating Microphone Cable Performance & Specifications]''</ref><ref>''[http://www.canare.com/UploadedDocuments/Cat11_p35.pdf The Star Quad Story]''</ref><ref>''[https://www.soundonsound.com/sos/nov09/articles/qa1109_4.htm What's Special About Star-Quad Cable?]''</ref><ref>''[http://www.belden.com/blog/broadcastav/How-Starquad-Works.cfm How Starquad Works]''</ref>\n\nA balanced line allows a [[Differential signaling|differential receiver]] to reduce the [[noise]] on a connection by rejecting [[common-mode interference]]. The lines have the same [[Electrical impedance|impedance]] to ground, so the interfering fields or currents induce the same voltage in both wires. Since the receiver responds only to the difference between the wires, it is not influenced by the induced noise voltage. If balanced line is used in an unbalanced circuit, with different impedances from each conductor to ground, currents induced in the separate conductors will cause different voltage drops to ground, thus creating a voltage differential, making the line more susceptible to noise. Examples of twisted pairs include [[category 5 cable]].\n\nCompared to unbalanced circuits, balanced lines reduce the amount of noise per distance, allowing a longer cable run to be practical. This is because electromagnetic interference will affect both signals the same way. Similarities between the two signals are automatically removed at the end of the transmission path when one signal is subtracted from the other.\n\n==Telephone systems==\nThe first application for balanced lines was for telephone lines. Interference that was of little consequence on a telegraph system (which is in essence digital) could be very disturbing for a telephone user. The initial format was to take two single-wire unbalanced telegraph lines and use them as a pair. This proved insufficient, however, with the growth of electric power transmission which tended to use the same routes. A telephone line running alongside a power line for many miles will inevitably have more interference induced in one leg than the other since one of them will be nearer to the power line. This issue was addressed by swapping the positions of the two legs every few hundred yards with a cross-over, thus ensuring that both legs had equal interference induced and allowing common-mode rejection to do its work. As the telephone system grew, it became preferable to use cable rather than open wires to save space, and also to avoid poor performance during bad weather. The cable construction used for balanced telephone cables was [[twisted pair]]; however, this did not become widespread until repeater amplifiers became available. For an unamplified telephone line, a twisted pair cable could only manage a maximum distance of 30&nbsp;km. Open wires, on the other hand, with their lower capacitance, had been used for enormous distances\u2014the longest was the 1500&nbsp;km from New York to Chicago built in 1893. [[Loading coils]] were used to improve the distance achievable with cable but the problem was not finally overcome until amplifiers started to be installed in 1912.<ref>Huurdeman, p.323.</ref> Twisted pair balanced lines are still widely used for [[local loop]]s, the lines that connect each subscriber's premises to their respective [[Telephone exchange|exchange]].<ref>Huurdeman, p.314-316.</ref>\n\nTelephone [[trunk line]]s, and especially [[frequency division multiplexing]] carrier systems, are usually 4-wire circuits rather than 2-wire circuits (or at least they were before [[fiber-optic|fibre-optic]] became widespread) and require a different kind of cable. This format requires the conductors to be arranged in two pairs, one pair for the sending (go) signal and the other for the return signal. The greatest source of interference on this kind of transmission is usually the crosstalk between the go and return circuits themselves. The most common cable format is [[star quad]], where the diagonally opposite conductors form the pairs. This geometry gives maximum common mode rejection between the two pairs. An alternative format is DM (Dieselhorst-Martin) quad which consists of two twisted pairs with the twisting at different pitches.<ref>Huurdeman, p.320.</ref>\n\n== Audio systems ==\n{{Main|Balanced audio}}\n[[File:Star quad microphone.svg|thumb|'''Fig. 5.''' Microphones connected to [[star quad cable]] join together diametrically opposite conductors to maintain balance. This is different from the usage on 4-wire circuits. The colours in this diagram correspond with the colouring in figure 2.]]\nAn example of balanced lines is the connection of [[microphone]]s to a mixer in professional systems. Classically, both dynamic and condenser microphones used [[transformer]]s to provide a differential-mode signal. While transformers are still used in the large majority of modern dynamic microphones, more recent condenser microphones are more likely to use electronic drive circuitry. Each leg, irrespective of any signal, should have an identical impedance to ground. Pair cable (or a pair-derivative such as [[Star quad cable|star quad]]) is used to maintain the balanced impedances and close twisting of the cores ensures that any interference is common to both conductors. Providing that the receiving end (usually a [[mixing console]]) does not disturb the line balance, and is able to ignore common-mode (noise) signals, and can extract differential ones, then the system will have excellent immunity to induced interference.\n\nTypical professional audio sources, such as microphones, have three-pin [[XLR connector]]s. One is the shield or chassis ground, while the other two are signal connections. These signal wires carry two copies of the same signal, but with opposite polarity. (They are often termed \"hot\" and \"cold,\" and the AES14-1992(r2004) Standard [and EIA Standard RS-297-A] suggest that the pin that carries the positive signal that results from a positive air pressure on a transducer will be deemed 'hot'. Pin 2 has been designated as the 'hot' pin, and that designation serves useful for keeping a consistent polarity in the rest of the system.) Since these conductors travel the same path from source to destination, the assumption is that any interference is induced upon both conductors equally. The appliance receiving the signals compares the difference between the two signals (often with disregard to electrical ground) allowing the appliance to ignore any induced electrical noise. Any induced noise would be present in equal amounts and in identical polarity on each of the balanced signal conductors, so the two signals\u2019 difference from each other would be unchanged. The successful rejection of induced noise from the desired signal depends in part on the balanced signal conductors receiving the same amount and type of interference. This typically leads to twisted, braided, or co-jacketed cables for use in balanced signal transmission.\n\n== Balanced and differential ==\n{{main|Balanced circuit}}\nMost explanations of balanced lines assume symmetric (antiphase) signals but this is an unfortunate confusion\u2014signal symmetry and balanced lines are quite independent of each other. Essential in a balanced line is matched impedances in the driver, line and receiver. These conditions ensure that external noise affects each leg of the differential line equally and thus appears as a common mode signal that is removed by the receiver. There are balanced drive circuits that have excellent common-mode [[impedance matching]] between \"legs\" but do ''not'' provide symmetric signals.<ref>{{cite web\n |url=http://www.jands.com.au/support/product-support/audio-technical-materials/geek-files/audio-balancing-issues-explained \n |title=Audio Balancing Issues \n |accessdate=2014-10-27 \n |author=Graham Blyth \n |authorlink=Graham Blyth \n |quote=Let\u2019s be clear from the start here: if the source impedance of each of these signals was not identical i.e. balanced, the method would fail completely, the matching of the differential audio signals being irrelevant, though desirable for headroom considerations. \n}}</ref><ref>{{cite book\n | title = Sound system equipment\n | edition = Third\n | year = 2000\n | publisher = [[International Electrotechnical Commission]]\n | location = Geneva\n | id = IEC 602689-3:2001\n | pages = 111\n | chapter = Part 3: Amplifiers\n | quote = Only the common-mode impedance balance of the driver, line, and receiver play a role in noise or interference rejection.

Gollum was a [[Hobbit#Divisions|Stoor Hobbit]]<ref group=T>''[[Unfinished Tales]]'', Part Three, IV. \"The Hunt for the Ring\", p 353, note 9.

Originally known as '''Sm\u00e9agol''', he was corrupted by the [[One Ring]] and later named Gollum after his habit of making \"a horrible swallowing noise in his throat\".<ref name=\"Riddles in the Dark\" group=T/>\n\nSm\u00e9agol obtained the Ring by murdering his cousin D\u00e9agol, who found it in the River Anduin. Gollum referred to the Ring as \"my precious\" or \"precious\", and it extended his life far beyond natural limits.

Gollum finally seized the Ring from [[Frodo Baggins]] at the Cracks of Doom in [[Mount Doom|Orodruin]] in [[Mordor]], but he fell into the fires of the volcano, where both he and the Ring were destroyed.\n\nScholars have compared Gollum to the shrivelled hag Gagool in [[Rider Haggard]]'s 1885 novel ''[[King Solomon's Mines]]'', and to the subterranean [[Morlocks]] in [[H.

To fit the concept of the ruling Ring that emerged during the writing of ''The Lord of the Rings'', Tolkien revised later editions of ''The Hobbit''. The version of the story given in the first edition became the lie that Bilbo made up to justify his possession of the Ring to the [[Dwarf (Middle-earth)|Dwarves]] and [[Gandalf]]. In the new version, Gollum pretended that he would show Bilbo the way out if he lost the riddle-game, but he actually planned to use the Ring to kill and eat the hobbit. Discovering the Ring missing, he suddenly realised the answer to Bilbo's last riddle\u2014\"What have I got in my pocket?\" (a question at first not meant as a riddle, but as a self-asked one)\u2014and flew into a rage. Bilbo inadvertently discovered the Ring's power of invisibility as he fled, allowing him to follow Gollum undetected to a back entrance of the caves. Gollum was convinced that Bilbo knew the way out all along, and hoped to intercept him near the entrance, lest the goblins apprehend Bilbo and find the Ring. Bilbo at first thought to kill Gollum in order to escape, but was overcome with pity, and so merely leaped over him. As Bilbo escaped, Gollum cried out, \"Thief, Thief, Thief! Baggins!

He made his way to the edge of [[Mordor]], where he met the monstrous spider [[Shelob]] and became her spy, worshiping her and bringing her food. He was eventually captured by [[Sauron]]'s forces and tortured, revealing to Sauron the names of \"Baggins\" and \"the [[Shire (Middle-earth)|Shire]]\". His testimony alerted the Dark Lord of Mordor to the existence and significance of Hobbits in general and the Baggins family in particular. He was freed, but was soon caught by [[Gandalf]] and [[Aragorn]], who interrogated him about the Ring and placed him in the care of the [[Silvan Elves|Wood Elves]] of [[Mirkwood]]. He escaped them (with the help of Sauron's [[Orc (Middle-earth)|Orcs]]) and descended into [[Moria (Middle-earth)|Moria]].<ref group=T>''[[The Fellowship of the Ring]]'', book 1, ch. 2 \"The Shadow of the Past\"</ref>\n\nGollum began following the [[Fellowship of the Ring (characters)|Fellowship of the Ring]] in Moria, but was noticed by [[Frodo Baggins]], Gandalf, and Aragorn. He trailed the Fellowship to the edge of [[Lothl\u00f3rien]]. He picked up their trail again as they left,<ref group=T>''[[The Fellowship of the Ring]]'', book 2, ch. 9 \"The Great River\"</ref> following them all the way to [[Rauros]], then pursued Frodo and [[Samwise Gamgee]] across the [[Emyn Muil]] when they struck out on their own towards Mordor.<ref name=\"The Taming of Sm\u00e9agol\" group=T/>\n\nFrodo and Sam confronted Gollum in the [[Emyn Muil]]; Gollum nearly strangled Sam, but Frodo subdued him with his [[Elf (Middle-earth)|Elvish]] sword, [[Sting (Middle-earth)|Sting]], which had once belonged to [[Bilbo Baggins|Bilbo]]. Frodo tied an Elvish rope around Gollum's ankle as a leash, but the mere touch of the rope pained him. Taking pity on the wretched creature, just as Bilbo once had, Frodo made Gollum swear to help them. Agreeing to the oath, Gollum swore by the \"precious\" itself, and Frodo released him.<ref name=\"The Taming of Sm\u00e9agol\" group=T/> The unlikely company, guided by Gollum, made their way to the [[Morannon|Black Gate]], the main entrance to Mordor. Frodo's kindness brought out Gollum's better nature, and he made at least some effort to keep his promise. Sam, however, despised Gollum upon sight, and often warned Frodo of the creature's deception and slipperiness.<ref group=T>''[[The Two Towers]]'', book 4, ch. 3, \"The Black Gate is Closed\"</ref>  \n\nWhen they reached the Black Gate and found it well-guarded, Gollum offered to lead them toward an alternate entrance into Mordor. Along the way, Frodo and Sam were seized by [[Faramir]], and Gollum slipped away uncaught (but not unseen) and followed them.<ref name=\"Of Herbs and Stewed Rabbit\" group=T/> When Frodo allowed Faramir to briefly take Gollum prisoner in order to spare his life, Gollum felt betrayed, and began plotting against his new \"master\". Faramir found out that Gollum was taking them to the pass of [[Cirith Ungol]], an entrance to Mordor through the [[Ephel D\u00faath]] mountains. He warned Frodo and Sam of the evil of that place, as well as the treachery he sensed in Gollum.<ref name=\"The Forbidden Pool\" group=T/>\n\nFrodo, Sam, and Gollum left Faramir and climbed the stairs to Cirith Ungol. Gollum slipped away and visited the giant spider Shelob, planning to feed the Hobbits to her and then get the Ring for himself when she was done. When he returned, he found the Hobbits asleep, and the sight of Frodo sleeping nearly moved Gollum to repent. However, Sam woke up and spoke harshly to him, and the opportunity for redemption was lost.<ref group=T>''[[The Two Towers]]'', book 4, ch. 8, \"The Stairs of Cirith Ungol\"</ref>  \n\nGollum followed through with his plan and led Frodo and Sam into [[Shelob's Lair]]. There, Frodo was stung by Shelob, taken prisoner by [[Orc (Middle-earth)|Orcs]], and hauled to the Tower of Cirith Ungol.<ref name=\"Shelob's Lair\" group=T>''[[The Two Towers]]'', book 4, ch. 9, \"Shelob's Lair\"</ref> Sam single-handedly rescued Frodo from the [[Tower of Cirith Ungol]] and, dressed in scavenged [[Middle-earth weapons and armour|Orc-armour]], the two began to make their way across the [[Gorgoroth (Middle-earth)|plateau of Gorgoroth]]. They finally arrived, against all odds, at [[Mount Doom]]. Gollum had secretly followed them, seeking a chance to seize the Ring. When Frodo and Sam had almost reached their destination, Gollum attacked them, but Frodo threw him down. Sam faced Gollum on his own, letting Frodo continue up the mountain to finish their mission. Like Bilbo and Frodo before him, Sam spared Gollum's life, turned his back on the creature, and followed Frodo.<ref group=T>''[[The Return of the King]]'', book 6, ch. 3, \"Mount Doom\"</ref> \n\nMoments later, Frodo stood on the edge of the Crack of Doom, but claimed the Ring for himself and put it on. Gollum struck, struggled with the invisible Frodo, bit off Frodo's finger, and seized the Ring. Gloating over his \"prize\" and dancing madly, he stepped over the edge and fell into the Crack of Doom, taking the Ring with him with a last cry of \"Precious!\" Thus, the Ring was destroyed and Sauron defeated. Sam cursed Gollum after his death, but Frodo urged his friend to forgive him, as without him the quest would have failed.<ref group=T>''[[The Return of the King]]'', book 6, ch. 4, \"The Field of Cormallen\"</ref>\n\n==Characteristics==\n[[File:Gollum s journey commences by Frederic Bennett (detail).jpg|thumb|Gollum by Frederic Bennet, 2014 (detail)]]\n\nIn the first edition of ''[[The Hobbit]]'' Tolkien made no reference to Gollum's size, leading some illustrators to portray him as being very large. Tolkien realised the omission, and clarified in later editions that Gollum was of average [[Hobbit]] size. ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'' characterises him as slightly larger than [[Sam Gamgee]].\n\nTolkien describes Gollum as either dark, bone-white or sallow; at one point the [[Man (Middle-earth)|Men]] of [[Ithilien]] mistake his silhouette seen from a distance for that of a tail-less black squirrel. In a manuscript written to guide illustrators to the appearance of his characters, Tolkien explained this by saying that Gollum had pale skin, but wore dark clothes and was often seen in poor light.<ref name=\"ME-ref|RC|pg 447\">{{ME-ref|RC|pg 447}}</ref> ''The Hobbit'' states he has pockets, in which he keeps a tooth-sharpening-rock, goblin teeth, wet shells, and a scrap of bat wing.\n\n''The Hobbit'' describes him as thin, with only six teeth sharpened into points.<ref name=\"Riddles in the Dark\" group=T/> Comparing him to [[Shelob]], one of the [[Orc (Middle-earth)|Orcs]] describes him as \"rather like a spider himself, or perhaps like a starved frog.\"\n\nIn ''[[The Fellowship of the Ring]]'', [[Aragorn]] states \"his malice gives him a strength hardly to be imagined.\" In ''[[The Two Towers]]'', Gollum's grip is described as \"soft, but horribly strong\" as he wrestles with Sam.\n\n===Personality===\n\nTolkien describes Gollum's personality after he had been captured by [[Frodo Baggins|Frodo]] and [[Sam Gamgee|Sam]]:<ref name=\"The Taming of Sm\u00e9agol\" group=T>''[[Return of the King]]'', book 4, ch. 1 \"The Taming of Sm\u00e9agol\"</ref>\n\n{{quote|text=For that moment a change, which lasted for some time, came over him. He spoke with less hissing and whining, and he spoke to his companions direct, not to his precious self. He would cringe and flinch, if they stepped near him or made any sudden movement, and he avoided the touch of their elven-cloaks; but he was friendly, and indeed pitifully anxious to please. He would cackle with laughter and caper if any jest was made, or even if Frodo spoke kindly to him, and weep if Frodo rebuked him.<ref name=\"The Taming of Sm\u00e9agol\" group=T/>}}\n\nGollum hates everything [[Elf (Middle-earth)|Elf]]-made.

In ''The Hobbit'', he always refers to himself as \"my precious\".<ref name=\"Riddles in the Dark\" group=T>''[[The Hobbit]]'', ch. 5 \"Riddles in the Dark\"</ref> When not referring to himself in third person, he sometimes speaks of himself in the plural as \"we\", hinting at his split personality. The rare occasions when he actually says \"I\" are interpreted by Frodo as an indication that Sm\u00e9agol's better self has the upper hand. Gollum also uses his own versions of words similar to the original words. He usually [[Reduplicated plural|adds -es to the end of a plural]], resulting in words such as \"hobbitses\" instead of hobbits or \"birdses\" instead of birds. When forming the present tense of verbs, he frequently extends the third person singular ending -s to other persons and numbers, resulting in constructions like \"we ''hates'' it\" (by analogy with \"he hates it\"). Gollum's speech emphasises [[sibilant]]s, often drawing them out.<ref group=T>''[[Return of the King]]'', Appendix F: II, \"On Translation\"</ref>\n\n===Age===\n\nThrough the influence of the [[One Ring]], Gollum's life was extended far beyond that of other members of his clan. An average [[hobbit]] lifespan is over 100 years, but a span of 556 years separates Gollum's finding of the Ring and its destruction, by which time he was almost 600 years old.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.glyphweb.com/arda/s/smeagol.html|title=Sm\u00e9agol |publisher=The Encyclopedia of Arda |accessdate=25 March 2015| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101024091258/http://www.glyphweb.com/ARDA/s/smeagol.html |archive-date=24 October 2010 |url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n==Significance==\n\n===Psychological \"pairing\" with Frodo===\n\nA variety of commentators have suggested that Gollum constitutes a \"[[Shadow (Jung)|shadow figure]]\" for Frodo, as his dark ''[[alter ego]]'' (\"other 'I'\") according to [[Carl Jung]]'s theory of psychological [[individuation]].

In short, as Tolkien writes, Gollum is \"not altogether wicked\".<!--Return of the King--><ref name=\"Callaway 1984\"/> Finally, at the end of the quest inside Mount Doom, Gollum takes the Ring from Frodo, and causes it to be destroyed, completing the quest successfully at the moment that Frodo had announced that he would keep the Ring. Callaway calls this \"the ultimate heroic self-sacrifice\", arguing that Gollum acted \"consciously\" using \"the good fraction in his mind finally overpowering the Ring's evil\".<ref name=\"Callaway 1984\"/> Tolkien wrote that it was direct intervention by [[Eru Il\u00favatar]], [[Middle-earth]]'s One [[God]], that led to Gollum's \"accident\".{{cn|date=April 2020}}\n\n===Degenerate===\n[[File:Walter Paget - H.

The CGI character was built around Serkis's facial features, voice, and acting choices.

As in the animated depictions of the character, Gollum is shown as virtually naked save for a loincloth in the trilogy.\n\nIn ''The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King'', Serkis himself appears in a [[Flashback (narrative)|flashback]] scene as Sm\u00e9agol before his degeneration into Gollum. This scene was originally earmarked for ''The Two Towers'', but was held back because the screenwriters felt audiences would relate better to the original Sm\u00e9agol once they were more familiar with who he became. The decision to include this scene meant that Raitt and Jamie Beswarick had to redesign Gollum's face for the second and third films so that it would more closely resemble Serkis'. The brief glimpses in ''The Fellowship of the Ring'' are of an earlier model of Gollum.\n\nIn Jackson's films, Gollum has a split personality: the childlike \"Sm\u00e9agol\" and the evil \"Gollum\". Screenwriters [[Fran Walsh]] and [[Philippa Boyens]] included scenes in ''The Two Towers'', ''The Return of the King'' and ''[[The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey|An Unexpected Journey]]'' in which \"Gollum\" and \"Sm\u00e9agol\" argue, with Serkis slightly altering his voice and body language to play the two as separate entities.

A reprint collected in one volume was released by [[Unwin Paperbacks]] in 1990 and by [[Del Rey Books]] in 2001.\n\n===In other media===\n[[File:Berlin Wall Gollum.jpg|right|thumb|A [[graffiti]] depiction of Gollum on the [[East Side Gallery]] of the [[Berlin Wall]] (2008)]]\n\nIn [[Sierra Entertainment]]'s ''[[The Lord of the Rings: War of the Ring]]'', a [[real-time strategy]] game based solely on the book, Gollum is a playable hero unit for the Minions of Sauron. [[Legolas]] and a guard of archers track him through Mirkwood, fighting giant spiders along the way.\n\nIn [[The Hobbit (2003 video game)|''The Hobbit'']] [[video game]] by [[Vivendi Universal]], released in 2003, Gollum appears in one [[cutscene]] depicting the scene in which he and Bilbo play the riddle game before Gollum discovers that Bilbo has the Ring and inadvertently leads Bilbo out of the Misty Mountains.\n\nGollum appears in ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring (video game)|The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring]]'' video game by [[Surreal Software]], also based only on the book. In a cutscene, Gollum can be shown in conversation with Aragorn, where Gollum throws a fish at him; it becomes his weapon for the final mission, as well as the most powerful weapon in the game.\n\n[[File:Gollum at Wellington Airport.jpg|thumb|Gollum sculpture at [[Wellington Airport]], 2013]]\n\nHe appears in [[Electronic Arts]]' games based on the Jackson films. In the real-time [[strategy game]] ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Battle for Middle-earth]]'', Gollum is a playable hero unit for Mordor. In its sequel, ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Battle for Middle-earth II]]'', which is also based on the film series, he is [[Non-player character|non-playable character]] (NPC). Instead, he walks around the map cloaked, carrying the Ring. When killed, he drops the Ring for a player to claim. He also appears in the action game ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King (video game)|The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King]]'' (based on the 2003 film), voiced by Serkis. He is an NPC who accompanies Frodo and Sam (the player) as the game progresses, but at Mount Doom becomes the final boss, whom the player must throw into the lava below. In the [[Game Boy]] version of ''The Return of the King'', he is a playable bonus character.\n\nHe appears in the video game ''[[Middle-earth: Shadow of Mordor]]'', voiced by [[Liam O'Brien]].\n\nA [[Lego minifigure]] version of Gollum, in his design from Serkis's character, is playable in ''[[Lego The Lord of the Rings (video game)|Lego The Lord of the Rings]]'', (with archive voice dialogues of Serkis), where he also serves as the final boss, and in ''[[Lego Dimensions]]''. His abilities include acrobatic skills and a boomerang fish. O'Brien reprises the voice role.\n\n[[Daedalic Entertainment]] developed a video game about Gollum.<ref>{{cite web |last=Shanley |first=Patrick |date=25 March 2019 |url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/heat-vision/lord-rings-gollum-video-game-works-1196607 |title='Lord of the Rings: Gollum' Video Game in the Works From German Studio Daedalic |publisher=[[The Hollywood Reporter]] |accessdate=25 March 2019}}</ref>\n\nGollum is [[Parody|spoofed]] in the video game ''[[Simon the Sorcerer]]'' (1993), where he seemingly appears with a fishing rod by a stream, but is revealed to be a [[cosplay]]ing [[Tolkien fandom|Tolkien fan]]; the interaction concludes with the titular Simon finding a magic invisibility ring in the stream with the fishing rod.<ref>{{cite AV media |title=[[Simon the Sorcerer]] |date=27 September 1993 |publisher=[[Adventure Soft]] |type=video game}}</ref>\n\n===In zoology===\nIn 1992, a [[Genus (biology)|genus]] of small sea slug was named ''Smeagol'' in reference to the original name of the Tolkien character.

R. R. Tolkien]]'s [[Middle-earth]]. He was introduced in the 1937 [[Juvenile fantasy|fantasy]] novel ''[[The Hobbit]]'', and became important in its sequel, ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]''. Gollum was a [[Hobbit#Divisions|Stoor Hobbit]]<ref group=T>''[[Unfinished Tales]]'', Part Three, IV. \"The Hunt for the Ring\", p 353, note 9. In a letter quoted by Christopher Tolkien, Tolkien refers to D\u00e9agol and Sm\u00e9agol as Stoors.</ref> of the River-folk, who lived near the [[Gladden Fields]]. Originally known as '''Sm\u00e9agol''', he was corrupted by the [[One Ring]] and later named Gollum after his habit of making \"a horrible swallowing noise in his throat\".<ref name=\"Riddles in the Dark\" group=T/>\n\nSm\u00e9agol obtained the Ring by murdering his cousin D\u00e9agol, who found it in the River Anduin. Gollum referred to the Ring as \"my precious\" or \"precious\", and it extended his life far beyond natural limits. Centuries of the Ring's influence twisted Gollum's body and mind, and, by the time of the novels, he \"loved and hated [the Ring], as he loved and hated himself.\"<ref name=\"shadow\" group=T>''[[The Fellowship of the Ring]]'', book 1, ch. 2 \"The Shadow of the Past\"</ref> Throughout the story, Gollum was torn between his lust for the Ring and his desire to be free of it. [[Bilbo Baggins]] found the Ring and took it for his own, and Gollum afterwards pursued it for the rest of his life. Gollum finally seized the Ring from [[Frodo Baggins]] at the Cracks of Doom in [[Mount Doom|Orodruin]] in [[Mordor]], but he fell into the fires of the volcano, where both he and the Ring were destroyed.\n\nScholars have compared Gollum to the shrivelled hag Gagool in [[Rider Haggard]]'s 1885 novel ''[[King Solomon's Mines]]'', and to the subterranean [[Morlocks]] in [[H. G. Wells]]'s 1895 novel ''[[The Time Machine]]''.\n\nGollum was played by [[Andy Serkis]] in [[Peter Jackson]]'s [[Lord of the Rings film trilogy|''Lord of the Rings'' film trilogy]].\n\n==Name==\n\nIn Appendix F of ''The Lord of the Rings'', the name Sm\u00e9agol is said to be a \"translation\" of the actual [[Middle-earth]] name ''Trahald'' (having to do with the idea of \"burrowing\", and rendered with a name based on [[Old English]] ''smygel'' of similar meaning).<ref>See definition: {{Cite web|first1=Joseph|last1=Bosworth| authorlink=Joseph Bosworth |first2=T.|last2=Northcote Toller|url=http://www.bosworthtoller.com/028184 |title=smygel|work=[[An Anglo-Saxon Dictionary]] (Online) | publisher=[[Charles University]]|location=Prague}} \u2013 a derivation of the verb ''sm\u00fagan'', which is the basis for the name of [[Smaug]], the dragon</ref> Several critics speculate that ''[[Beowulf]]''{{'s}} [[Grendel]] could have been an inspiration for Gollum due to the many parallels between them\u2014such as their affinity for water, their isolation from society, and their bestial description.<ref>{{cite journal|first=Brent|last=Nelson|title=Cain-Leviathan Typology in Gollum and Grendel|journal=Extrapolation|volume=49|issue=3|date=2008|publisher=[[University of Liverpool]]|location=Liverpool, England|page=466|doi=10.3828/extr.2008.49.3.8}}</ref> Tolkien accredited ''Beowulf'' as one of his \"most valued sources\" when writing ''The Hobbit''.<ref>{{cite book|first=J.R.R.|last=Tolkien|authorlink=J.R.R.

He survived on cave fish, which he caught from a small boat, and small [[Orc (Middle-earth)|goblins]] who strayed too far from [[Goblin Town|the stronghold]] of the Great Goblin. Over the years, his eyes adapted to the dark and became \"lamp-like\", shining with a sickly pale light.<ref name=\"Riddles in the Dark\" group=T/>\n\n[[Bilbo Baggins]] stumbled upon Gollum's lair, having found the Ring in the network of goblin tunnels leading down to the lake. At his wits' end in the dark, Bilbo agreed to a [[Riddle|riddle game]] with Gollum on the chance of being shown the way out of the mountains.<ref name=\"Riddles in the Dark\" group=T/> In the first edition of ''The Hobbit'', Gollum's size is not stated.<ref>{{cite book |first=Michael D.

To fit the concept of the ruling Ring that emerged during the writing of ''The Lord of the Rings'', Tolkien revised later editions of ''The Hobbit''. The version of the story given in the first edition became the lie that Bilbo made up to justify his possession of the Ring to the [[Dwarf (Middle-earth)|Dwarves]] and [[Gandalf]]. In the new version, Gollum pretended that he would show Bilbo the way out if he lost the riddle-game, but he actually planned to use the Ring to kill and eat the hobbit. Discovering the Ring missing, he suddenly realised the answer to Bilbo's last riddle\u2014\"What have I got in my pocket?\" (a question at first not meant as a riddle, but as a self-asked one)\u2014and flew into a rage. Bilbo inadvertently discovered the Ring's power of invisibility as he fled, allowing him to follow Gollum undetected to a back entrance of the caves. Gollum was convinced that Bilbo knew the way out all along, and hoped to intercept him near the entrance, lest the goblins apprehend Bilbo and find the Ring. Bilbo at first thought to kill Gollum in order to escape, but was overcome with pity, and so merely leaped over him. As Bilbo escaped, Gollum cried out, \"Thief, Thief, Thief! Baggins! We hates it, we hates it, we hates it forever!\"<ref name=\"Riddles in the Dark\" group=T/>\n\n===''The Lord of the Rings''===\n\nGollum's real name was Sm\u00e9agol, and he had once been a member of the secluded branch of the early Stoorish [[Hobbit]]s. He spent the early years of his life with his extended family under a [[matriarch]], his grandmother. On Sm\u00e9agol's birthday, he and his relative<ref name=\"letter 214\" group=T>''[[Letters of J.R.R. Tolkien|Letters]]'', #214</ref> D\u00e9agol went fishing in the [[Gladden Fields]]. There, D\u00e9agol found [[One Ring|the Ring]] in the riverbed after being pulled into the water by a fish. Sm\u00e9agol fell immediately under the Ring's influence and demanded it as a birthday present; when D\u00e9agol refused, Sm\u00e9agol strangled him.<ref group=T>''[[The Fellowship of the Ring]]'', book 1, ch. 2 \"The Shadow of the Past\"</ref>\n\nSm\u00e9agol later used the Ring for thieving, spying and antagonising his friends and relatives, who nicknamed him \"Gollum\" for the swallowing noise he made in his throat, until his grandmother disowned him. He wandered in the wilderness for a few years until he finally retreated to a deep cavern in the [[Misty Mountains]]. The Ring's malignant influence twisted his body and mind, and prolonged his life well beyond its natural limits.<ref group=T>''[[The Fellowship of the Ring]]'', book 1, ch. 2 \"The Shadow of the Past\"</ref>\n\nGollum left his cave in pursuit of [[Bilbo Baggins]] a few years after losing the Ring, but the trail was cold. He made his way to the edge of [[Mordor]], where he met the monstrous spider [[Shelob]] and became her spy, worshiping her and bringing her food. He was eventually captured by [[Sauron]]'s forces and tortured, revealing to Sauron the names of \"Baggins\" and \"the [[Shire (Middle-earth)|Shire]]\". His testimony alerted the Dark Lord of Mordor to the existence and significance of Hobbits in general and the Baggins family in particular. He was freed, but was soon caught by [[Gandalf]] and [[Aragorn]], who interrogated him about the Ring and placed him in the care of the [[Silvan Elves|Wood Elves]] of [[Mirkwood]]. He escaped them (with the help of Sauron's [[Orc (Middle-earth)|Orcs]]) and descended into [[Moria (Middle-earth)|Moria]].<ref group=T>''[[The Fellowship of the Ring]]'', book 1, ch. 2 \"The Shadow of the Past\"</ref>\n\nGollum began following the [[Fellowship of the Ring (characters)|Fellowship of the Ring]] in Moria, but was noticed by [[Frodo Baggins]], Gandalf, and Aragorn. He trailed the Fellowship to the edge of [[Lothl\u00f3rien]]. He picked up their trail again as they left,<ref group=T>''[[The Fellowship of the Ring]]'', book 2, ch. 9 \"The Great River\"</ref> following them all the way to [[Rauros]], then pursued Frodo and [[Samwise Gamgee]] across the [[Emyn Muil]] when they struck out on their own towards Mordor.<ref name=\"The Taming of Sm\u00e9agol\" group=T/>\n\nFrodo and Sam confronted Gollum in the [[Emyn Muil]]; Gollum nearly strangled Sam, but Frodo subdued him with his [[Elf (Middle-earth)|Elvish]] sword, [[Sting (Middle-earth)|Sting]], which had once belonged to [[Bilbo Baggins|Bilbo]]. Frodo tied an Elvish rope around Gollum's ankle as a leash, but the mere touch of the rope pained him. Taking pity on the wretched creature, just as Bilbo once had, Frodo made Gollum swear to help them. Agreeing to the oath, Gollum swore by the \"precious\" itself, and Frodo released him.<ref name=\"The Taming of Sm\u00e9agol\" group=T/> The unlikely company, guided by Gollum, made their way to the [[Morannon|Black Gate]], the main entrance to Mordor. Frodo's kindness brought out Gollum's better nature, and he made at least some effort to keep his promise. Sam, however, despised Gollum upon sight, and often warned Frodo of the creature's deception and slipperiness.<ref group=T>''[[The Two Towers]]'', book 4, ch. 3, \"The Black Gate is Closed\"</ref>  \n\nWhen they reached the Black Gate and found it well-guarded, Gollum offered to lead them toward an alternate entrance into Mordor. Along the way, Frodo and Sam were seized by [[Faramir]], and Gollum slipped away uncaught (but not unseen) and followed them.<ref name=\"Of Herbs and Stewed Rabbit\" group=T/> When Frodo allowed Faramir to briefly take Gollum prisoner in order to spare his life, Gollum felt betrayed, and began plotting against his new \"master\". Faramir found out that Gollum was taking them to the pass of [[Cirith Ungol]], an entrance to Mordor through the [[Ephel D\u00faath]] mountains. He warned Frodo and Sam of the evil of that place, as well as the treachery he sensed in Gollum.<ref name=\"The Forbidden Pool\" group=T/>\n\nFrodo, Sam, and Gollum left Faramir and climbed the stairs to Cirith Ungol. Gollum slipped away and visited the giant spider Shelob, planning to feed the Hobbits to her and then get the Ring for himself when she was done. When he returned, he found the Hobbits asleep, and the sight of Frodo sleeping nearly moved Gollum to repent. However, Sam woke up and spoke harshly to him, and the opportunity for redemption was lost.<ref group=T>''[[The Two Towers]]'', book 4, ch. 8, \"The Stairs of Cirith Ungol\"</ref>  \n\nGollum followed through with his plan and led Frodo and Sam into [[Shelob's Lair]]. There, Frodo was stung by Shelob, taken prisoner by [[Orc (Middle-earth)|Orcs]], and hauled to the Tower of Cirith Ungol.<ref name=\"Shelob's Lair\" group=T>''[[The Two Towers]]'', book 4, ch. 9, \"Shelob's Lair\"</ref> Sam single-handedly rescued Frodo from the [[Tower of Cirith Ungol]] and, dressed in scavenged [[Middle-earth weapons and armour|Orc-armour]], the two began to make their way across the [[Gorgoroth (Middle-earth)|plateau of Gorgoroth]]. They finally arrived, against all odds, at [[Mount Doom]]. Gollum had secretly followed them, seeking a chance to seize the Ring. When Frodo and Sam had almost reached their destination, Gollum attacked them, but Frodo threw him down. Sam faced Gollum on his own, letting Frodo continue up the mountain to finish their mission. Like Bilbo and Frodo before him, Sam spared Gollum's life, turned his back on the creature, and followed Frodo.<ref group=T>''[[The Return of the King]]'', book 6, ch. 3, \"Mount Doom\"</ref> \n\nMoments later, Frodo stood on the edge of the Crack of Doom, but claimed the Ring for himself and put it on. Gollum struck, struggled with the invisible Frodo, bit off Frodo's finger, and seized the Ring. Gloating over his \"prize\" and dancing madly, he stepped over the edge and fell into the Crack of Doom, taking the Ring with him with a last cry of \"Precious!\" Thus, the Ring was destroyed and Sauron defeated. Sam cursed Gollum after his death, but Frodo urged his friend to forgive him, as without him the quest would have failed.<ref group=T>''[[The Return of the King]]'', book 6, ch. 4, \"The Field of Cormallen\"</ref>\n\n==Characteristics==\n[[File:Gollum s journey commences by Frederic Bennett (detail).jpg|thumb|Gollum by Frederic Bennet, 2014 (detail)]]\n\nIn the first edition of ''[[The Hobbit]]'' Tolkien made no reference to Gollum's size, leading some illustrators to portray him as being very large. Tolkien realised the omission, and clarified in later editions that Gollum was of average [[Hobbit]] size. ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'' characterises him as slightly larger than [[Sam Gamgee]].\n\nTolkien describes Gollum as either dark, bone-white or sallow; at one point the [[Man (Middle-earth)|Men]] of [[Ithilien]] mistake his silhouette seen from a distance for that of a tail-less black squirrel. In a manuscript written to guide illustrators to the appearance of his characters, Tolkien explained this by saying that Gollum had pale skin, but wore dark clothes and was often seen in poor light.<ref name=\"ME-ref|RC|pg 447\">{{ME-ref|RC|pg 447}}</ref> ''The Hobbit'' states he has pockets, in which he keeps a tooth-sharpening-rock, goblin teeth, wet shells, and a scrap of bat wing.\n\n''The Hobbit'' describes him as thin, with only six teeth sharpened into points.<ref name=\"Riddles in the Dark\" group=T/> Comparing him to [[Shelob]], one of the [[Orc (Middle-earth)|Orcs]] describes him as \"rather like a spider himself, or perhaps like a starved frog.\"\n\nIn ''[[The Fellowship of the Ring]]'', [[Aragorn]] states \"his malice gives him a strength hardly to be imagined.\" In ''[[The Two Towers]]'', Gollum's grip is described as \"soft, but horribly strong\" as he wrestles with Sam.\n\n===Personality===\n\nTolkien describes Gollum's personality after he had been captured by [[Frodo Baggins|Frodo]] and [[Sam Gamgee|Sam]]:<ref name=\"The Taming of Sm\u00e9agol\" group=T>''[[Return of the King]]'', book 4, ch. 1 \"The Taming of Sm\u00e9agol\"</ref>\n\n{{quote|text=For that moment a change, which lasted for some time, came over him. He spoke with less hissing and whining, and he spoke to his companions direct, not to his precious self.

The rare occasions when he actually says \"I\" are interpreted by Frodo as an indication that Sm\u00e9agol's better self has the upper hand. Gollum also uses his own versions of words similar to the original words. He usually [[Reduplicated plural|adds -es to the end of a plural]], resulting in words such as \"hobbitses\" instead of hobbits or \"birdses\" instead of birds. When forming the present tense of verbs, he frequently extends the third person singular ending -s to other persons and numbers, resulting in constructions like \"we ''hates'' it\" (by analogy with \"he hates it\"). Gollum's speech emphasises [[sibilant]]s, often drawing them out.<ref group=T>''[[Return of the King]]'', Appendix F: II, \"On Translation\"</ref>\n\n===Age===\n\nThrough the influence of the [[One Ring]], Gollum's life was extended far beyond that of other members of his clan. An average [[hobbit]] lifespan is over 100 years, but a span of 556 years separates Gollum's finding of the Ring and its destruction, by which time he was almost 600 years old.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.glyphweb.com/arda/s/smeagol.html|title=Sm\u00e9agol |publisher=The Encyclopedia of Arda |accessdate=25 March 2015| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101024091258/http://www.glyphweb.com/ARDA/s/smeagol.html |archive-date=24 October 2010 |url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n==Significance==\n\n===Psychological \"pairing\" with Frodo===\n\nA variety of commentators have suggested that Gollum constitutes a \"[[Shadow (Jung)|shadow figure]]\" for Frodo, as his dark ''[[alter ego]]'' (\"other 'I'\") according to [[Carl Jung]]'s theory of psychological [[individuation]]. Some have identified many such \"pairings\", such as [[Denethor]] as a shadow for [[Theoden]], [[Boromir]] for [[Aragorn]], [[Saruman]] for [[Gandalf]], [[Ted Sandyman]] for [[Sam Gamgee]], the [[Barrow-wight]] for [[Tom Bombadil]], and [[Shelob]] for [[Galadriel]], but the Gollum/Frodo pairing is by far the most widely accepted.<ref name=\"VV.2019\">{{cite book |last=Honegger |first=Thomas |title=More Light than Shadow? |work=Tolkien: Light and Shadow |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bGCzDwAAQBAJ&pg=PT152 |year=2019 |publisher=Kipple Officina Libraria |isbn=978-88-321-7907-1 |pages=151-154}}</ref>\n\n===Evil guide===\n\nThe Tolkien scholar Charles W.

In short, as Tolkien writes, Gollum is \"not altogether wicked\".<!--Return of the King--><ref name=\"Callaway 1984\"/> Finally, at the end of the quest inside Mount Doom, Gollum takes the Ring from Frodo, and causes it to be destroyed, completing the quest successfully at the moment that Frodo had announced that he would keep the Ring. Callaway calls this \"the ultimate heroic self-sacrifice\", arguing that Gollum acted \"consciously\" using \"the good fraction in his mind finally overpowering the Ring's evil\".<ref name=\"Callaway 1984\"/> Tolkien wrote that it was direct intervention by [[Eru Il\u00favatar]], [[Middle-earth]]'s One [[God]], that led to Gollum's \"accident\".{{cn|date=April 2020}}\n\n===Degenerate===\n[[File:Walter Paget - H.

The CGI character was built around Serkis's facial features, voice, and acting choices.

As in the animated depictions of the character, Gollum is shown as virtually naked save for a loincloth in the trilogy.\n\nIn ''The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King'', Serkis himself appears in a [[Flashback (narrative)|flashback]] scene as Sm\u00e9agol before his degeneration into Gollum. This scene was originally earmarked for ''The Two Towers'', but was held back because the screenwriters felt audiences would relate better to the original Sm\u00e9agol once they were more familiar with who he became. The decision to include this scene meant that Raitt and Jamie Beswarick had to redesign Gollum's face for the second and third films so that it would more closely resemble Serkis'. The brief glimpses in ''The Fellowship of the Ring'' are of an earlier model of Gollum.\n\nIn Jackson's films, Gollum has a split personality: the childlike \"Sm\u00e9agol\" and the evil \"Gollum\". Screenwriters [[Fran Walsh]] and [[Philippa Boyens]] included scenes in ''The Two Towers'', ''The Return of the King'' and ''[[The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey|An Unexpected Journey]]'' in which \"Gollum\" and \"Sm\u00e9agol\" argue, with Serkis slightly altering his voice and body language to play the two as separate entities.

The season officially began on 1 November 2019 and will end on 30 April 2020; however, a tropical cyclone could form at any time between 1 July 2019 and 30 June 2020 and would count towards the season total. The season featured the region's second-latest start on record (behind only the [[1986\u201387 Australian region cyclone season|1986\u201387 season]]), with the formation of the first tropical low only occurring on 4 January 2020. As of 11 April, a total of seven tropical cyclones have existed within the region, which represents the region's least active season by this date since 2016\u201317. Three systems have intensified further into severe tropical cyclones, and three systems have made landfall within the region at tropical cyclone intensity. A total of 28 fatalities have been caused, either directly or indirectly, as a result of impacts from the season's systems.\n\nDuring the season, tropical cyclones will be officially monitored by the [[Australian Bureau of Meteorology]] (BOM), the [[Meteorology, Climatology, and Geophysical Agency]] (BMKG), and the National Weather Service of [[Papua New Guinea]]. The [[United States]]' [[Joint Typhoon Warning Center]] (JTWC), and other national agencies such as the [[Fiji Meteorological Service]] (FMS), the [[MetService|Meteorological Service of New Zealand]] (MetService), and [[M\u00e9t\u00e9o-France#Worldwide|M\u00e9t\u00e9o-France]] at [[R\u00e9union|La R\u00e9union]], will also monitor parts of the basin during the season. \n\n__TOC__\n{{Clear}}\n\n== Seasonal forecasts==\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"float:right\"\n|- \n! colspan=2|Source/Record\n!

It persisted for two weeks and reached category 3 on the [[Australian tropical cyclone scale]] before dissipating west of Australia. Later that month, a tropical low formed and lasted for a week before dissipating in late January without been named. Three other tropical lows formed in late January and early February. One of them dissipated later. Another one of them has been moving in and out of the Australian region. It was designated 06F by the [[Fiji Meteorological Service]].

However, by the next day, Esther was deemed not likely to emerge overseas contrary to forecast and the TCFA was cancelled while its convection weakened yet again. On 29 February, the TCFA was re-issued as Esther's center skirted the northeastern Kimberley coast. On 1 March, the TCFA was once again cancelled as the system began moving further inland.

Pacific cyclone season\n}}\nThe '''2019\u201320 Australian region cyclone season''' is the currently active period of the year when most [[tropical cyclones]] form in the southern [[Indian Ocean|Indian]] and [[Pacific Ocean|Pacific]] Oceans between [[90th meridian east|90\u00b0E]] and [[160th meridian east|160\u00b0E]]. The season officially began on 1 November 2019 and will end on 30 April 2020; however, a tropical cyclone could form at any time between 1 July 2019 and 30 June 2020 and would count towards the season total. The season featured the region's second-latest start on record (behind only the [[1986\u201387 Australian region cyclone season|1986\u201387 season]]), with the formation of the first tropical low only occurring on 4 January 2020. As of 11 April, a total of seven tropical cyclones have existed within the region, which represents the region's least active season by this date since 2016\u201317. Three systems have intensified further into severe tropical cyclones, and three systems have made landfall within the region at tropical cyclone intensity. A total of 28 fatalities have been caused, either directly or indirectly, as a result of impacts from the season's systems.\n\nDuring the season, tropical cyclones will be officially monitored by the [[Australian Bureau of Meteorology]] (BOM), the [[Meteorology, Climatology, and Geophysical Agency]] (BMKG), and the National Weather Service of [[Papua New Guinea]]. The [[United States]]' [[Joint Typhoon Warning Center]] (JTWC), and other national agencies such as the [[Fiji Meteorological Service]] (FMS), the [[MetService|Meteorological Service of New Zealand]] (MetService), and [[M\u00e9t\u00e9o-France#Worldwide|M\u00e9t\u00e9o-France]] at [[R\u00e9union|La R\u00e9union]], will also monitor parts of the basin during the season. \n\n__TOC__\n{{Clear}}\n\n== Seasonal forecasts==\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"float:right\"\n|- \n! colspan=2|Source/Record\n!

Blake would later make landfall in  northwestern [[Australia]] and soon degenerate afterwards. At the same time, Claudia, another tropical cyclone, formed. It persisted for two weeks and reached category 3 on the [[Australian tropical cyclone scale]] before dissipating west of Australia. Later that month, a tropical low formed and lasted for a week before dissipating in late January without been named. Three other tropical lows formed in late January and early February.
