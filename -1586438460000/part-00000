[[Messali Hadj]], [[Imache Amar]], [[Si Djilani]], and [[Belkacem Radjef]] rapidly built a strong following throughout France and Algeria in the 1930s. They developed militants who became vital to the fighting for an independent Algeria. This became widespread after World War II.\n\nSince Algeria gained independence in 1962, tensions have arisen between Kabylie and the central government on several occasions. In July 1962, the [[National Liberation Front (Algeria)|FLN]] (National Liberation Front) was split rather than united. Indeed, many actors who contributed to independence wanted a share of power but the [[National Liberation Army (Algeria)|ALN]] (National Liberation Army) directed by [[Houari Boum\u00e9di\u00e8ne|Houari Boumediene]] joined by [[Ahmed Ben Bella]] seemed to had the upper hand because they of their military forces.{{Citation needed|date=May 2019}}\n\nIn 1963 the [[Socialist Forces Front|FFS]] party of [[Hocine A\u00eft Ahmed]] contested the authority of the [[National Liberation Front (Algeria)|FLN]], which had promoted itself as the only party in the nation. A\u00eft Ahmed and others consider that the central government led by [[Ahmed Ben Bella|Ben Bella]] is authoritarian and on September the 3<sup>rd</sup> 1963 the [[Socialist Forces Front|FFS]] (Socialist Forces front) was created by [[Hocine A\u00eft Ahmed]].<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Monbeig|first=Pierre|date=1992|title=Une opposition politique dans l'impasse.

As a consequence, the insurrection was a failure in 1965 because it was hugely repressed by the forces of the [[National Liberation Army (Algeria)|ALN]] directed by [[Houari Boum\u00e9di\u00e8ne|Houari Boumediene]].

In 1994\u20131995, the Kabyle conducted a school boycott, termed the \"strike of the school bag\". In June and July 1998, they protested, in events that turned violent, after the assassination of singer [[Matoub Lounes]] and passage of the law requiring use of Arabic in all fields.\n\nIn the months following April 2001 (called the [[Black Spring (Kabylie)|Black Spring]]), major riots among the Kabyle took place following the killing of [[Masinissa Guermah]], a young Kabyle, by gendarmes. At the same time, organized activism produced the ''[[Arouch]]'', and neo-traditional local councils.

The difficult mountainous landscape of the [[Tizi Ouzou Province|Tizi Ouzou]] and [[Bejaia Province|Bejaia]] provinces served as a refuge, to which most of the Kabyle people retreated when under pressure or occupation. They were able to preserve their cultural heritage in such isolation from other cultural influences.\n\nThe area supported local dynasties (Numidia, Fatimids in the Kutama periods, Zirids, Hammadids, and Hafsids of Beja\u00efa) or Algerian modern nationalism, and the war of independence. The region was repeatedly occupied by various conquerors. Romans and Byzantines controlled the main road and valley during the period of antiquity and avoided the mountains (Mont ferratus).<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.harmatheque.com/ebook/la-kabylie-orientale-dans-l-histoire-pays-des-kutuma-et-guerre-coloniale-39716|title=Ebook LA KABYLIE ORIENTALE DANS L'HISTOIRE - Pays des Kutuma et guerre coloniale de Hosni Kitouni|website=www.harmatheque.com|access-date=2016-11-29}}</ref> [[Spread of Islam|During the spread of Islam]], Arabs controlled plains but not all the countryside (they were called ''el aadua'' : enemy by the Kabyle).<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Abdelfettah Lalmi|first=Nedjma|date=2004-01-01|title=Du mythe de l'isolat kabyle|journal=Cahiers d'\u00c9tudes Africaines|language=fr|volume=44|issue=175|pages=507\u2013531|doi=10.4000/etudesafricaines.4710|issn=0008-0055}}</ref>\n\nThe [[Regency of Algiers]], under Ottoman influence, tried to have indirect influence over the people (makhzen tribes of Amraoua, and marabout).<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.universalis.fr/encyclopedie/kabyles/|title=KABYLES|last=Universalis|first=Encyclop\u00e6dia|website=Encyclop\u00e6dia Universalis|access-date=2016-11-29}}</ref>\n\nThe French gradually and totally conquered the region and set up a direct administration. [[File:Djurdjura.JPG|thumb|300px|right|The [[Djurdjura]] chain]]\n[[File:Kabylie topographic map-fr.svg|thumb|200px|Topographic map of Kabylia.]]\nAlgerian provinces with significant Kabyle-speaking populations include [[Tizi Ouzou]], [[B\u00e9ja\u00efa]] and [[Bouira]], where they are a majority, as well as [[Boumerdes]], [[Setif]], [[Bordj Bou Arreridj]], and [[Jijel]]. [[Algiers]] also has a significant Kabyle population, where they make up more than half of the capital's population.\n\nThe Kabyle region is referred to as ''Al Qabayel'' (\"tribes\") by the Arabic-speaking population and as ''Kabylie'' in French. Its indigenous inhabitants call it ''Tamurt Idurar'' (\"Land of Mountains\") or ''Tamurt n Iqbayliyen''/''Tamurt n Iqbayliyen'' (\"Land of the Kabyle\"). It is part of the [[Atlas Mountains]] and is located at the edge of the Mediterranean.\n\n== Culture and society ==\n\n=== Language ===\nThe Kabyle speak [[Kabyle language|Kabyle]], a [[Berber language]] of the [[Afro-Asiatic]] family. As second and third languages, many people speak [[Algerian Arabic]], [[French language|French]] and, to a lesser degree [[English language|English]].\n\nDuring the first centuries of their history, Kabyles used the [[Tifinagh]] writing system. Since the beginning of the 19th century, and under French influence, Kabyle intellectuals began to use the [[Latin script]]. It is the basis for the modern [[Berber Latin alphabet]].\n\nAfter the [[History of Algeria|independence of Algeria]], some Kabyle activists tried to revive the old Tifinagh alphabet. This new version of Tifinagh has been called [[Neo-Tifinagh]], but its use remains limited to [[logo]]s. Kabyle literature has continued to be written in the Latin script.\n\n=== Religion ===\nThe Kabyle people are mainly [[Muslim]], with a small [[Christians|Christian]] minority.<ref>Abdelmadjid Hannoum, ''Violent Modernity: France in Algeria'', Page 124, 2010, Harvard Center for Middle Eastern studies, Cambridge, Massachusetts.Amar Boulifa, ''Le Djurdjura \u00e0 travers l'histoire depuis l'Antiquit\u00e9 jusqu'en 1830 : organisation et ind\u00e9pendance des Zouaoua (Grande Kabylie)'', Page 197, 1925, Algiers.</ref> Many [[Zaouia]] exist all over the region; the [[Rahmaniyya]] is the most prolific.\n\n[[Catholic]]s of Kabyle background generally live in France and result from intermarriage with the French.

Mountain and hill farming is gradually giving way to local industry (textile and agro-alimentary). In the middle of the 20th century, with the influence and funding by the Kabyle diaspora, many industries were developed in this region. It has become the second most important industrial region in the country after Algiers.{{citation needed|date=September 2012}}\n\n== Politics ==\nThe Kabyle have been fierce activists in promoting the cause of Berber (''Amazigh'') identity. The movement has three groups: those Kabyle who identify as part of a larger Berber nation ([[Berberism|Berberists]]); those who identify as part of the Algerian nation (known as \"Algerianists\", some view Algeria as an essentially Berber nation); and those who consider the Kabyle to be a distinct nation separate from (but akin to) other Berber peoples (known as [[Kabylism|Kabylists]]).\n* Two political parties dominate in Kabylie and have their principal support base there: the [[Socialist Forces Front]] (FFS), led by [[Hocine A\u00eft Ahmed]], and the [[Rally for Culture and Democracy]] (RCD), led by [[Sa\u00efd Sadi]]. Both parties are [[secularist]], [[Berberist]] and [[Algerianist]].\n* The Arouch emerged during the [[Black Spring (Kabylie)|Black Spring]] of 2001 as a revival of the village assembly, a traditional Kabyle form of democratic organization. The Arouch share roughly the same political views as the FFS and the RCD.\n* The [[Movement for the Autonomy of Kabylie|MAK (Movement for the Autonomy of Kabylie)]] also emerged during the Black Spring, It claimed the right for a regional autonomy of Kabylie. On 21 April 2010, MAK proclaimed a Provisional Government of Kabylie in exile (ANAVAD). Ferhat Mehenni was elected President by the National Council of the MAK.<ref>[http://www.kabylia-gov.org www. kabylia-gov.org], Kabylia Government website</ref>  In 2013, MAK officially became an [[Independence| independantist]] movement and changed its name to [[The Mouvement for the Self-determination of Kabylie]].\n\n== Diaspora ==\nFor historical and economic reasons, many Kabyles have emigrated to France, both for work and to escape political persecution.

[[Messali Hadj]], [[Imache Amar]], [[Si Djilani]], and [[Belkacem Radjef]] rapidly built a strong following throughout France and Algeria in the 1930s. They developed militants who became vital to the fighting for an independent Algeria. This became widespread after World War II.\n\nSince Algeria gained independence in 1962, tensions have arisen between Kabylie and the central government on several occasions. In July 1962, the [[National Liberation Front (Algeria)|FLN]] (National Liberation Front) was split rather than united. Indeed, many actors who contributed to independence wanted a share of power but the [[National Liberation Army (Algeria)|ALN]] (National Liberation Army) directed by [[Houari Boum\u00e9di\u00e8ne|Houari Boumediene]] joined by [[Ahmed Ben Bella]] seemed to had the upper hand because they of their military forces.{{Citation needed|date=May 2019}}\n\nIn 1963 the [[Socialist Forces Front|FFS]] party of [[Hocine A\u00eft Ahmed]] contested the authority of the [[National Liberation Front (Algeria)|FLN]], which had promoted itself as the only party in the nation. A\u00eft Ahmed and others consider that the central government led by [[Ahmed Ben Bella|Ben Bella]] is authoritarian and on September the 3<sup>rd</sup> 1963 the [[Socialist Forces Front|FFS]] (Socialist Forces front) was created by [[Hocine A\u00eft Ahmed]].<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Monbeig|first=Pierre|date=1992|title=Une opposition politique dans l'impasse.

But after Mohand Ouelhadj\u2019s defection, A\u00eft Ahmed could barely sustain the movement and after the [[National Liberation Front (Algeria)|FLN]] congress on April 16<sup>th</sup> 1964 which reinforced the government\u2019s legitimacy, he was arrested on October 1964. As a consequence, the insurrection was a failure in 1965 because it was hugely repressed by the forces of the [[National Liberation Army (Algeria)|ALN]] directed by [[Houari Boum\u00e9di\u00e8ne|Houari Boumediene]]. In 1965 [[Hocine A\u00eft Ahmed|A\u00eft Ahmed]] was sentenced to death, but was later pardoned by [[Ahmed Ben Bella|Ben Bella]].

In 1994\u20131995, the Kabyle conducted a school boycott, termed the \"strike of the school bag\". In June and July 1998, they protested, in events that turned violent, after the assassination of singer [[Matoub Lounes]] and passage of the law requiring use of Arabic in all fields.\n\nIn the months following April 2001 (called the [[Black Spring (Kabylie)|Black Spring]]), major riots among the Kabyle took place following the killing of [[Masinissa Guermah]], a young Kabyle, by gendarmes. At the same time, organized activism produced the ''[[Arouch]]'', and neo-traditional local councils. The protests gradually decreased after the Kabyle won some concessions from President [[Abdelaziz Bouteflika]].\n\nOn 6 January 2016, Tamazight was officially recognized in Algeria's constitution as a language that was equal to Arabic.<ref name=\"APS\">{{cite web |url=http://constitutionnet.org/sites/default/files/algeria_french.pdf |title=AVANT PROJET DE REVISION DE LA CONSTITUTION |publisher=[[Algeria Press Service]] |date=6 January 2016 |access-date=28 May 2019}}</ref>\n\n== Geography ==\n\n[[File:Kabyle-speaking-map.jpg|thumb|200px|upright=2| Regions of Kabyle settlements in Algeria]]\n\nThe geography of the Kabyle region played an important role in the people's history. The difficult mountainous landscape of the [[Tizi Ouzou Province|Tizi Ouzou]] and [[Bejaia Province|Bejaia]] provinces served as a refuge, to which most of the Kabyle people retreated when under pressure or occupation. They were able to preserve their cultural heritage in such isolation from other cultural influences.\n\nThe area supported local dynasties (Numidia, Fatimids in the Kutama periods, Zirids, Hammadids, and Hafsids of Beja\u00efa) or Algerian modern nationalism, and the war of independence. The region was repeatedly occupied by various conquerors. Romans and Byzantines controlled the main road and valley during the period of antiquity and avoided the mountains (Mont ferratus).<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.harmatheque.com/ebook/la-kabylie-orientale-dans-l-histoire-pays-des-kutuma-et-guerre-coloniale-39716|title=Ebook LA KABYLIE ORIENTALE DANS L'HISTOIRE - Pays des Kutuma et guerre coloniale de Hosni Kitouni|website=www.harmatheque.com|access-date=2016-11-29}}</ref> [[Spread of Islam|During the spread of Islam]], Arabs controlled plains but not all the countryside (they were called ''el aadua'' : enemy by the Kabyle).<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Abdelfettah Lalmi|first=Nedjma|date=2004-01-01|title=Du mythe de l'isolat kabyle|journal=Cahiers d'\u00c9tudes Africaines|language=fr|volume=44|issue=175|pages=507\u2013531|doi=10.4000/etudesafricaines.4710|issn=0008-0055}}</ref>\n\nThe [[Regency of Algiers]], under Ottoman influence, tried to have indirect influence over the people (makhzen tribes of Amraoua, and marabout).<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.universalis.fr/encyclopedie/kabyles/|title=KABYLES|last=Universalis|first=Encyclop\u00e6dia|website=Encyclop\u00e6dia Universalis|access-date=2016-11-29}}</ref>\n\nThe French gradually and totally conquered the region and set up a direct administration. [[File:Djurdjura.JPG|thumb|300px|right|The [[Djurdjura]] chain]]\n[[File:Kabylie topographic map-fr.svg|thumb|200px|Topographic map of Kabylia.]]\nAlgerian provinces with significant Kabyle-speaking populations include [[Tizi Ouzou]], [[B\u00e9ja\u00efa]] and [[Bouira]], where they are a majority, as well as [[Boumerdes]], [[Setif]], [[Bordj Bou Arreridj]], and [[Jijel]]. [[Algiers]] also has a significant Kabyle population, where they make up more than half of the capital's population.\n\nThe Kabyle region is referred to as ''Al Qabayel'' (\"tribes\") by the Arabic-speaking population and as ''Kabylie'' in French. Its indigenous inhabitants call it ''Tamurt Idurar'' (\"Land of Mountains\") or ''Tamurt n Iqbayliyen''/''Tamurt n Iqbayliyen'' (\"Land of the Kabyle\"). It is part of the [[Atlas Mountains]] and is located at the edge of the Mediterranean.\n\n== Culture and society ==\n\n=== Language ===\nThe Kabyle speak [[Kabyle language|Kabyle]], a [[Berber language]] of the [[Afro-Asiatic]] family. As second and third languages, many people speak [[Algerian Arabic]], [[French language|French]] and, to a lesser degree [[English language|English]].\n\nDuring the first centuries of their history, Kabyles used the [[Tifinagh]] writing system. Since the beginning of the 19th century, and under French influence, Kabyle intellectuals began to use the [[Latin script]]. It is the basis for the modern [[Berber Latin alphabet]].\n\nAfter the [[History of Algeria|independence of Algeria]], some Kabyle activists tried to revive the old Tifinagh alphabet. This new version of Tifinagh has been called [[Neo-Tifinagh]], but its use remains limited to [[logo]]s. Kabyle literature has continued to be written in the Latin script.\n\n=== Religion ===\nThe Kabyle people are mainly [[Muslim]], with a small [[Christians|Christian]] minority.<ref>Abdelmadjid Hannoum, ''Violent Modernity: France in Algeria'', Page 124, 2010, Harvard Center for Middle Eastern studies, Cambridge, Massachusetts.Amar Boulifa, ''Le Djurdjura \u00e0 travers l'histoire depuis l'Antiquit\u00e9 jusqu'en 1830 : organisation et ind\u00e9pendance des Zouaoua (Grande Kabylie)'', Page 197, 1925, Algiers.</ref> Many [[Zaouia]] exist all over the region; the [[Rahmaniyya]] is the most prolific.\n\n[[Catholic]]s of Kabyle background generally live in France and result from intermarriage with the French.

Mountain and hill farming is gradually giving way to local industry (textile and agro-alimentary). In the middle of the 20th century, with the influence and funding by the Kabyle diaspora, many industries were developed in this region. It has become the second most important industrial region in the country after Algiers.{{citation needed|date=September 2012}}\n\n== Politics ==\nThe Kabyle have been fierce activists in promoting the cause of Berber (''Amazigh'') identity. The movement has three groups: those Kabyle who identify as part of a larger Berber nation ([[Berberism|Berberists]]); those who identify as part of the Algerian nation (known as \"Algerianists\", some view Algeria as an essentially Berber nation); and those who consider the Kabyle to be a distinct nation separate from (but akin to) other Berber peoples (known as [[Kabylism|Kabylists]]).\n* Two political parties dominate in Kabylie and have their principal support base there: the [[Socialist Forces Front]] (FFS), led by [[Hocine A\u00eft Ahmed]], and the [[Rally for Culture and Democracy]] (RCD), led by [[Sa\u00efd Sadi]]. Both parties are [[secularist]], [[Berberist]] and [[Algerianist]].\n* The Arouch emerged during the [[Black Spring (Kabylie)|Black Spring]] of 2001 as a revival of the village assembly, a traditional Kabyle form of democratic organization. The Arouch share roughly the same political views as the FFS and the RCD.\n* The [[Movement for the Autonomy of Kabylie|MAK (Movement for the Autonomy of Kabylie)]] also emerged during the Black Spring, It claimed the right for a regional autonomy of Kabylie. On 21 April 2010, MAK proclaimed a Provisional Government of Kabylie in exile (ANAVAD). Ferhat Mehenni was elected President by the National Council of the MAK.<ref>[http://www.kabylia-gov.org www. kabylia-gov.org], Kabylia Government website</ref>  In 2013, MAK officially became an [[Independence| independantist]] movement and changed its name to [[The Mouvement for the Self-determination of Kabylie]].\n\n== Diaspora ==\nFor historical and economic reasons, many Kabyles have emigrated to France, both for work and to escape political persecution.

Alex, who is married, later confronts Saanvi at the hospital about the incident saying it cannot happen again, but Saanvi has no memory of the event.\n| LineColor       = 3F4469\n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber   = 25\n| EpisodeNumber2  = 9\n| Title           = Airplane Bottles\n| DirectedBy      = [[Ramaa Mosley]]\n| WrittenBy       = Matthew Lau & MW Cartozian Wilson\n| OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2020|3|9}}\n| ProdCode        = T30.10209\n| Viewers         = 3.67<ref name=\"2.09\">{{cite web|url=http://www.showbuzzdaily.com/articles/showbuzzdailys-top-150-monday-cable-originals-network-finals-3-9-2020.html|title=Updated: ShowBuzzDaily's Top 150 Monday Cable Originals & Network Finals: 3.9.2020|last=Metcalf|first=Mitch|date=March 11, 2020|work=Showbuzz Daily|accessdate=March 11, 2020}}</ref>\n| ShortSummary    = When Zeke goes to see Saanvi about the frostbite he is slowly developing, he finds that Saanvi has been developing short-term memory loss causing him to call in Alex. Two [[Internal affairs (law enforcement)|internal affairs]] agents arrive at the 129th Precinct to presumably discuss Jared's involvement with the Xers, but they instead question Michaela about the cases she solves using mysterious means. Michaela states that she won't continue until she gets a [[union representative]] by her side. Jared confronts Simon about the situation, and Simon says Michaela is a threat who must be disposed of. Cal's latest Calling is shared with Ben, Grace, and a recuperating TJ, where they try to build something during what appears to be a thunderstorm outside. Thanks to some clues, they managed to pull together a makeshift ship's rigging, which briefly places them on an ancient boat from which they see Flight 828 in the sky; they also learn that the ancient mariners who tried to get rid of the Callings went mad. Alex is able to get a counter-agent injected into Saanvi as she advises her to be careful. Recognizing the union rep from a previous Xer meeting, Jared has to arrest Michaela before the relocated meeting in order to keep her from getting killed by the union rep.\n| LineColor       = 3F4469\n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber   = 26\n| EpisodeNumber2  = 10\n| Title           = Course Deviation\n| DirectedBy      = [[Michael Smith (director)|Michael Smith]]\n| WrittenBy       = Laura Putney & Margaret Easley\n| OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2020|3|16}}\n| ProdCode        = T30.10210\n| Viewers         = 4.29<ref name=\"2.10\">{{cite web|url=http://www.showbuzzdaily.com/articles/showbuzzdailys-top-150-monday-cable-originals-network-finals-3-16-2020.html|title=Updated: ShowBuzzDaily's Top 150 Monday Cable Originals & Network Finals: 3.16.2020|last=Metcalf|first=Mitch|date=March 17, 2020|work=Showbuzz Daily|accessdate=March 17, 2020}}</ref>\n| ShortSummary    = After Michaela is bailed out, Jared and Kate reveal to her that Jared has been working undercover to disrupt the Xers. Grace gets a calling about a bridge over the Harlem River. She and Ben go there and find Adrian, who had the same calling. Grace\u2019s water breaks and Ben rushes her to the hospital. Shortly after, Adrian rescues a kayaker from the river. At the hospital, Ben has to make a choice to save Grace or the baby as the specialist surgeon hasn't arrived yet, and he chooses Grace (against her wishes). It turns out the specialist surgeon who can save both Grace and the baby is the man rescued by Adrian. Despite this, Adrian tells Ben he still does not believe the callings are ultimately good. Jared is called to the bar where Billy and other Xers are holding Zeke captive. Simon arrives with Erika and orders Zeke to be killed, which is heard by Michaela and others through the bug. This leads to Simon, Erika, Billy, and two other Xers being arrested during the police raid. Tamara accuses Jared of only getting close to her to capture the Xers which Jared denies.

Michaela works with Jared to follow Oscar's steps, resulting in a bust at a meth lab run by ex-con Jace Baylor.

Following an Xer meeting, Simon advises Jared to keep an eye on Billy as he can be a loose cannon. Michaela and Drea witness Jared leaving the bar and kissing Tamara. After Drea infiltrate the bar and interacts with Billy, Michaela finds that Billy has had some arrest records. As the ruined nightclub is used for memorials, Ben's latest Calling takes him to a zen mediation center. When he brings Olive, another chanting Calling leads them underground where they find TJ still alive underground. With a warrant from Judge Trilling, Michaela secretly plants a bug in the bar, obtains evidence Jared is working with the Xers, and gives it to Bowers. Bowers privately shares the information with Jared. Saanvi kisses her former lover and fellow doctor, Alex, in a park.

Michaela states that she won't continue until she gets a [[union representative]] by her side. Jared confronts Simon about the situation, and Simon says Michaela is a threat who must be disposed of. Cal's latest Calling is shared with Ben, Grace, and a recuperating TJ, where they try to build something during what appears to be a thunderstorm outside. Thanks to some clues, they managed to pull together a makeshift ship's rigging, which briefly places them on an ancient boat from which they see Flight 828 in the sky; they also learn that the ancient mariners who tried to get rid of the Callings went mad. Alex is able to get a counter-agent injected into Saanvi as she advises her to be careful.

Shortly after, Adrian rescues a kayaker from the river. At the hospital, Ben has to make a choice to save Grace or the baby as the specialist surgeon hasn't arrived yet, and he chooses Grace (against her wishes).
