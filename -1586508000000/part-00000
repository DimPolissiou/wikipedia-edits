{"title_page": "List of government-owned companies", "text_new": "{{short description|Wikipedia list article}}\n{{main|State-owned enterprises}}\nThis is a world-wide '''list of government-owned companies'''. This list can be considered as non-exhaustive because of lack of space and time. For example, China alone has in the [[wikipedia]] database as of October 2019 more than 350 individual entries in its \"Government-owned companies of China\" Category page.\n\nThe paragraph that follows was paraphrased from a 1996 [[GAO]] report which investigated only the 20th-century American experience. The GAO report did not consider the potential use in the international forum of SOEs as extensions of a nation's foreign policy utensils. A [[government-owned corporation]] is a legal entity that undertakes [[commerce|commercial]] activities on behalf of an owner [[government]]. Their legal status varies from being a part of government to [[joint-stock company|stock companies]] with a state as a regular [[shareholder|stockholder]]. There is no standard definition of a government-owned corporation (GOC) or state-owned enterprise (SOE), although the two terms can be used interchangeably. The defining characteristics are that they have a distinct legal form and that they are established to operate in commercial affairs. While they may also have public policy objectives, GOCs should be differentiated from other forms of government agencies or state entities established to pursue purely non-financial objectives.<ref name=gao>{{cite book|publisher=United States General Accounting Office|title=Report to the Ranking Minority Member, Subcommittee on Post Office and Civil Service, Committee on Governmental Affairs, U.S. Senate - GOVERNMENT CORPORATIONS - Profiles of Existing Government Corporations |pages=1\u201316|date=December 1995|quote=GAO/GGD-96-14|url=https://www.gao.gov/assets/230/222015.pdf}}</ref>\n\n{{TOC right}}\n\n==Government-owned companies==\n\n=== Afghanistan ===\nIn 2009, the [[Government of the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan]] formed the [[Afghan public protection force|Afghan Public Protection Force (APPF)]] as a \"state owned enterprise\" subordinate to the [[Ministry of the Interior (Afghanistan)|Ministry of the Interior]].

[[Caixa Econ\u00f4mica Federal]], [[Correios]], [[Empresa Brasileira de Pesquisa Agropecu\u00e1ria|Embrapa]], [[Brazilian Development Bank|BNDES]] and [[University of S\u00e3o Paulo|USP]] are examples of public enterprises. Mixed-economy companies are enterprises with the majority of stocks owned by the government, but that also have stocks owned by the [[private sector]] and usually have their shares traded on [[stock exchange]]s. [[Banco do Brasil]], [[Petrobras]], [[Sabesp]], and [[Eletrobras]] are examples of mixed-economy companies.\n\nBeginning in the 1990s, the central government of Brazil launched a privatization program inspired by the [[Washington Consensus]]. State-owned enterprises such as [[Vale (mining company)|Vale do Rio Doce]], [[Telebr\u00e1s]], [[Companhia Sider\u00fargica Nacional|CSN]], and [[Usiminas]] (most of them mixed-economy companies) were transferred to the private sector as part of this policy.\n\nBrasil State Owned Companies Fact Sheet / Download from the planejamento.gov.br website.<ref>http://www.planejamento.gov.br/secretarias/upload/Arquivos/dest/perfil_empresas_estatais/2014/2015_ano_base_2014.pdf</ref>\n\n===Brunei===\n* [[Brunei Investment Agency]]\n\n===Bulgaria===\n* [[Bulgarian Energy Holding]]\n* [[Bulgarian Posts]]\n* [[Bulgarian State Railways]]\n* [[LB Bulgaricum]]\n* [[National Railway Infrastructure Company]]\n* [[Kintex]]\n* [[Sofia Airport]]\n\n===Canada===\n{{main article|Crown corporations of Canada}}\nIn [[Canada]], state-owned corporations are referred to as ''Crown corporations'', indicating that an organization is established by law, owned by the sovereign (either [[Monarchy of Canada|in right of Canada]] or [[Monarchy in the Canadian provinces|a province]]), and overseen by parliament and cabinet.

In the late 1980s, the government began to reform the state-owned enterprise, and during the 1990s and 2000s, many mid-sized and small sized state-owned enterprises were privatized and went public. There are a number of different corporate forms which result in a mixture of public and private capital. In PRC terminology, a state-owned enterprise refers to a particular corporate form, which is increasingly being replaced by the [[public company|listed company]].{{fact|date=January 2017}} State-owned enterprises are mostly governed by both local governments' SASAC and, in the central government, [[State-owned Assets Supervision and Administration Commission of the State Council|the State-owned Assets Supervision and Administration Commission (SASAC) of the State Council]]. However, some state-owned enterprise were governed by [[China Investment Corporation]] (and its domestic arm [[Central Huijin Investment]]), as well as under the governance of [[Ministry of Education of the People's Republic of China|Ministry of Education]] for the university-run enterprises, or some financial institutes that were under the governance of the [[Ministry of Finance of the People's Republic of China|Ministry of Finance]].\n\nAs of 2011, 35% of business activity and 43% of profits in the People's Republic of China resulted from companies in which the state owned a majority interest.

Hence Crown corporations did not play as significant a role in the development of the territory as in many other British territories.\n\nThe [[MTR Corporation]] (MTR) was formed as a Crown corporation, mandated to operate under \"prudent commercial principles\", in 1975. The [[Kowloon-Canton Railway]], operated under a government department, was corporatised in 1982 to imitate the success of MTR (see [[Kowloon-Canton Railway Corporation]]). MTR was privatised in 2000 although the Hong Kong Government is still the majority shareholder. KCR was operationally merged with MTR in 2007.\n\nExamples of present-day statutory bodies include the [[Airport Authority Hong Kong|Airport Authority]], responsible for running the [[Hong Kong International Airport]], or the [[Hong Kong Housing Authority|Housing Authority]], which provides housing to about half of Hong Kong residents.\n\n===Colombia===\n[[File:EDIFICIO EPM.jpg|thumb|[[Empresas P\u00fablicas de Medell\u00edn]] headquarters]]\n* [[Ecopetrol]]\n* [[Empresas P\u00fablicas de Medell\u00edn]]\n* [[ETB (company)|ETB]]\n* [https://www.lasceibas.gov.co/ Las Ceibas - Empresas P\u00fablicas de Neiva E.S.P]\n\n===Cuba===\n* [[ETECSA|Empresa de Telecomunicaciones de Cuba S.A.]]\n* [[Union de Industrias Militares]]\n\n=== Czech Republic ===\n{{main article|St\u00e1tn\u00ed podnik}}\n* [[Budweiser Budvar Brewery]]\n* \u010cEPS, a.s.\n* [[\u010cEZ Group]]\n* [[\u010cesk\u00e9 dr\u00e1hy]]\n\n===Denmark===\n* [[Banedanmark]]\n* [[Danske Spil]]\n* [[DR (broadcaster)|DR]]\n* [[DSB (railway company)|DSB]]\n* [[Energinet.dk]]\n* [[\u00d8rsted (company)|\u00d8rsted]]\n* [[PostNord]] (40%)\n\n'''Municipal'''\n* Aarhus Vand A/S\n* Kalundborg Forsyning A/S\n* Middelgrunden offshore electricity generation wind farm\n* Sams\u00f8 offshore electricity generation wind farm and district heating plants\n* Vandcenter Syd as\n\n===Egypt===\n* [[Egypt Post]]\n* [[EgyptAir]]\n* [[Egyptian National Railways]]\n* [[Nile TV]]\n* [[Suez Canal Authority]]\n* [[Telecom Egypt]]\n* [[EGPC]]\n* [[ERTU]]\n* [[EGAS]]\n* [[Arab Contractors]]\n* [[National Bank of Egypt]]\n* [[Banque Misr]]\n\n===Finland===\n{{main|List of Finnish government enterprises}}\n{{div col|colwidth=30em}}\n* [[Alko]]\n* [[Altia]]\n* [[CSC \u2013 IT Center for Science]]\n* [[Destia]]\n* [[Hansel Ltd.]]\n* [[Laatumaa]]\n* [[Mets\u00e4hallitus]]\n* [[National Land Survey of Finland]]\n* [[Omaisuudenhoitoyhti\u00f6 Arsenal]]\n* [[Patria (company)|Patria]]\n* [[Senate Properties]]\n* [[Veikkaus]]\n* [[VR Group]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n===France===\n{{main|Agence des participations de l'\u00c9tat}}\n\n===Gabon===\n* [[Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Nationale Petroli\u00e8re Gabonaise]]\n\n===Germany===\n{{main|State-owned enterprises of Germany}}\n\n===Ghana===\n* [[Ghana National Petroleum Corporation]]\n* [[Ghana Oil Company]]\n* [[Volta River Authority]]\n\n===Greenland===\n* [[Greenland Airport Authority]]\n\n===Hungary===\n{{div col|colwidth=30em}}\n* [[Hungarian State Railways]]\n* [[Kossuth R\u00e1di\u00f3]]\n* [[Magyar Posta]]\n* [[Magyar R\u00e1di\u00f3]]\n* [[Magyar Telev\u00edzi\u00f3]]\n* [[MVM Group]]\n* [[Paks Nuclear Power Plant]]\n* [[State Printing Company]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n===India===\n{{main|List of public sector undertakings in India}}\nIn [[India]], state-owned enterprise is termed a [[Public Sector Undertakings in India|Public Sector Undertaking]] (PSU) or a Central Public Sector Enterprise (CPSE).

A big customer might be the government or a government agency. The other type is government agencies which might also do activities competing with private owned companies. They usually are funded by tax money but can also sell services. The government has tried to avoid having agencies doing commercial activities, by separating out areas that compete with private companies into government-owned companies, for example within road construction. The reason is both to avoid unfair competition, and a wish to have [[market economy]] instead of [[plan economy]] as much as possible.

The GAO report did not consider the potential use in the international forum of SOEs as extensions of a nation's foreign policy utensils. A [[government-owned corporation]] is a legal entity that undertakes [[commerce|commercial]] activities on behalf of an owner [[government]]. Their legal status varies from being a part of government to [[joint-stock company|stock companies]] with a state as a regular [[shareholder|stockholder]]. There is no standard definition of a government-owned corporation (GOC) or state-owned enterprise (SOE), although the two terms can be used interchangeably. The defining characteristics are that they have a distinct legal form and that they are established to operate in commercial affairs. While they may also have public policy objectives, GOCs should be differentiated from other forms of government agencies or state entities established to pursue purely non-financial objectives.<ref name=gao>{{cite book|publisher=United States General Accounting Office|title=Report to the Ranking Minority Member, Subcommittee on Post Office and Civil Service, Committee on Governmental Affairs, U.S. Senate - GOVERNMENT CORPORATIONS - Profiles of Existing Government Corporations |pages=1\u201316|date=December 1995|quote=GAO/GGD-96-14|url=https://www.gao.gov/assets/230/222015.pdf}}</ref>\n\n{{TOC right}}\n\n==Government-owned companies==\n\n=== Afghanistan ===\nIn 2009, the [[Government of the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan]] formed the [[Afghan public protection force|Afghan Public Protection Force (APPF)]] as a \"state owned enterprise\" subordinate to the [[Ministry of the Interior (Afghanistan)|Ministry of the Interior]].

In the late 1980s, the government began to reform the state-owned enterprise, and during the 1990s and 2000s, many mid-sized and small sized state-owned enterprises were privatized and went public. There are a number of different corporate forms which result in a mixture of public and private capital. In PRC terminology, a state-owned enterprise refers to a particular corporate form, which is increasingly being replaced by the [[public company|listed company]].{{fact|date=January 2017}} State-owned enterprises are mostly governed by both local governments' SASAC and, in the central government, [[State-owned Assets Supervision and Administration Commission of the State Council|the State-owned Assets Supervision and Administration Commission (SASAC) of the State Council]]. However, some state-owned enterprise were governed by [[China Investment Corporation]] (and its domestic arm [[Central Huijin Investment]]), as well as under the governance of [[Ministry of Education of the People's Republic of China|Ministry of Education]] for the university-run enterprises, or some financial institutes that were under the governance of the [[Ministry of Finance of the People's Republic of China|Ministry of Finance]].\n\nAs of 2011, 35% of business activity and 43% of profits in the People's Republic of China resulted from companies in which the state owned a majority interest.

Hence Crown corporations did not play as significant a role in the development of the territory as in many other British territories.\n\nThe [[MTR Corporation]] (MTR) was formed as a Crown corporation, mandated to operate under \"prudent commercial principles\", in 1975. The [[Kowloon-Canton Railway]], operated under a government department, was corporatised in 1982 to imitate the success of MTR (see [[Kowloon-Canton Railway Corporation]]).

A big customer might be the government or a government agency. The other type is government agencies which might also do activities competing with private owned companies. They usually are funded by tax money but can also sell services. The government has tried to avoid having agencies doing commercial activities, by separating out areas that compete with private companies into government-owned companies, for example within road construction. The reason is both to avoid unfair competition, and a wish to have [[market economy]] instead of [[plan economy]] as much as possible.

Matilde planned to set up the technical school as per advice Archbishop Fattal, which was to be run in part by the [[Marist Brothers]]. But, less than a year in, they left Aleppo, subsequently abandoning the school, partly due to the conclusion of the promulgation of the [[French Mandate|'French Mandate']] which joined the states of Aleppo and Damascus to create the State of Syria. She once again turned to the Archbishop, in which he suggested they leave for Turin and request the then Rector Major of the Salesians, [[Pietro Ricaldone|Pedro Ricaldone]], to supply the school with teachers and spiritual guidance. \n\nThe school finally opened its doors in 1948, amidst the then ravenous Israeli-Palestinian war. Soon, both the school and institute were met by refugees from the neighboring countries.

In March of 1960 however, while slowly returning to her regular life of active service, the cancerous malignancy returned. She then traveled to the famous Grotto of [[Our Lady of Lourdes]] in Lourdes, France. She returned to Aleppo and died on February 7, 1961, aged 54.

In some mythologies, a character known as the Grim Reaper causes the victim's death by coming to collect that person's soul. Other beliefs hold that the Spectre of Death is only a [[psychopomp]], serving to sever the last ties between the soul and the body, and to guide the deceased to the [[afterlife]], without having any control over when or how the victim dies. Death is most often personified in male form,{{cn|date=January 2019}} although in certain cultures Death is perceived as female (for instance, [[Marzanna]] in [[Slavic mythology]], [[Dhumavati]] in [[Hindu mythology|Indian mythology]], or [[La Catrina]] in [[Mexico]]).\n\n==By region==\n{{More citations needed|section|date=December 2019}}\n\n=== Middle Eastern ===\n{{Main|Mot (god)}}\nThe Canaanites of the 12th- and 13th-century BC Levant personified death as the god Mot (<small>{{abbr|lit.|literally}}</small>&nbsp;\"Death\"). He was considered a son of the [[king of the gods]], [[El (god)|El]]. His contest with the [[storm god]] [[Ba\u02bfal]] forms part of the [[Ba\u02bfal Cycle|myth cycle]] from the [[Ugaritic texts]]. The [[Phoenician religion|Phoenicians]] also worshipped death under the name Mot and a version of Mot later became Maweth, the devil or angel of death in Judaism.<ref name=\"Baal and Mot in the Ugaritic Texts\">{{cite journal|last1=Cassuto|first1=U.|title=Baal and Mot in the Ugaritic Texts|journal=Israel Exploration Journal|date=1962|volume=12|issue=2|pages=81\u201383|jstor=27924890}}</ref><ref>See, e.g., {{bibleref|Hab.|2:5|HE}} & {{bibleref|Job|18:13|HE}}.</ref>\n\n===Hellenic===\n{{main|Thanatos}}In [[Ancient Greek religion]] and [[Greek mythology]], Death ([[Thanatos]]) is one of the twin sons of [[Nyx]] (night). Like her, he is seldom portrayed directly. He sometimes appears in art as a winged and bearded man, and occasionally as a winged and beardless youth. When he appears together with his twin brother, [[Hypnos]], the god of sleep, Thanatos generally represents a gentle death. Thanatos, led by [[Hermes (mythology)|Hermes ''psychopompos'']], takes the shade of the deceased to the near shore of the river [[Styx]], whence the boatman [[Charon (mythology)|Charon]], on [[Charon's obol|payment of a small fee]], conveys the shade to [[Hades]], the realm of the dead. Homer's ''[[Iliad]]'' 16.681, and the [[Euphronios Krater]]'s depiction of the same episode, have [[Apollo]] instruct the removal of the heroic, semi-divine [[Sarpedon#Son of Zeus and Laodamia|Sarpedon]]'s body from the battlefield by Hypnos and Thanatos, and conveyed thence to his homeland for proper funeral rites.{{citation needed|date=March 2018}} Among the other children of Nyx are Thanatos' sisters, the [[Keres (Greek mythology)|Keres]], blood-drinking, vengeant spirits of violent or untimely death, portrayed as fanged and taloned, with bloody garments.\n\n===Celtic===\n[[Image:Banshee.jpg|thumbnail|''Bunworth Banshee'', \"Fairy Legends and Traditions of the South of Ireland\", by Thomas Crofton Croker, 1825]]\nIn [[Bretons|Breton]] folklore, a spectral figure called the [[Ankou]] (''yr Angau'' in [[Welsh language|Welsh]]) portends death. Usually, the Ankou is the spirit of the last person that died within the community and appears as a tall, haggard figure with a wide hat and long white hair or a skeleton with a revolving head. The Ankou drives a deathly wagon or cart with a creaking axle. The cart or wagon is piled high with corpses and a stop at a cabin means instant death for those inside.<ref>Anatole Le Braz : L\u00e9gende de la Mort</ref>\n\nIrish mythology features a similar creature known as a [[dullahan]], whose head would be tucked under his or her arm (dullahans were not one, but an entire species). The head was said to have large eyes and a smile that could reach the head's ears. The dullahan would ride a black horse or a carriage pulled by black horses, and stop at the house of someone about to die, and call their name, and immediately the person would die. The dullahan did not like being watched, and it was believed that if a dullahan knew someone was watching them, they would lash that person's eyes with their whip, which was made from a spine; or they would toss a basin of blood on the person, which was a sign that the person was next to die.\n\nGaelic lore also involves a female [[spirit]] known as [[Banshee]] (Modern Irish Gaelic: ''bean s\u00ed'' pron. banshee, literally ''fairy woman''), who heralds the death of a person by shrieking or keening. The banshee is often described as wearing red or green, usually with long, disheveled hair. She can appear in a variety of forms, typically that of an ugly, frightful hag, but in some stories she chooses to appear young and beautiful. Some tales recount that the creature was actually a [[ghost]], often of a specific murdered woman or a mother who died in childbirth. When several banshees appeared at once, it was said to indicate the death of someone great or holy. In Ireland and parts of Scotland, a traditional part of mourning is the keening woman (bean chaointe), who wails a lament \u2013 in [[Irish language|Irish]]: Caoineadh, caoin meaning \"to weep, to wail.\" \n\nIn Scottish folklore there was a belief that a black, dark green or white dog known as a [[C\u00f9 S\u00ecth]] took dying souls to the afterlife. Comparable figures exist in Irish and [[C\u0175n Annwn|Welsh]] stories.\n\nIn Welsh Folklore, Gwyn ap Nudd is the escort of the grave, the personification of Death and Winter who leads the wild hunt to collect wayward souls and escort them to the Otherworld, sometimes it is Melwas, Arawn or Afallach in a similar position.\n\n==American use of the grim reaper==\n\nThe grim reaper is depicted as a skeleton with a black cloak which symbolizes death and evil. He carries a [[sickle]] which meant people to be killed and die.\n\n===Latin America===\n[[File:Posada2.Catrina.jpeg|thumbnail|[[La Calavera Catrina]]]]\n\nAs is the case in many [[Romance languages]] (including French, Portuguese, Italian, and Romanian), the Spanish word for death, ''muerte,'' is a [[Grammatical gender in Spanish|feminine noun]]. As such, it is common in Spanish-speaking cultures to personify death as a female figure. \n\nIn [[Aztec mythology]], [[Mict\u0113cacihu\u0101tl|Mictecacihuatl]] is the \"[[Queen regnant|Queen]] of [[Mictlan]]\" (the Aztec [[underworld]]), ruling over the [[afterlife]] with her husband [[Mictlantecuhtli]]. Other epithets for her include \"Lady of the Dead,\" as her role includes keeping watch over the bones of the dead. Mictecacihuatl was represented with a fleshless body and with jaw agape to swallow the stars during the day. She presided over the ancient festivals of the dead, which evolved from Aztec traditions into the modern [[Day of the Dead]] after synthesis with Spanish cultural traditions.{{Citation needed|date=December 2019}}\n\n[[Santa Muerte|Our Lady of the Holy Death]] (Santa Muerte) is a female [[deity]] or [[folk saint]] of Mexican folk religion, whose popularity has been growing in [[Mexico]] and the [[United States]] in recent years. Since the [[pre-Columbian era]], Mexican culture has maintained a certain reverence towards death, as seen in the widespread commemoration of the Day of the Dead. [[La Calavera Catrina]], a character symbolizing death, is also an icon of the Mexican Day of the Dead.\n\n[[San La Muerte]] (Saint Death) is a skeletal folk saint venerated in [[Paraguay]], northeast [[Argentina]], and southern [[Brazil]]. As the result of internal migration in Argentina since the 1960s, the veneration of San La Muerte has been extended to [[Greater Buenos Aires]] and the national prison system as well. Saint Death is depicted as a male skeleton figure usually holding a [[scythe]]. Although the [[Catholic Church]] in Mexico has attacked the devotion of Saint Death as a tradition that mixes paganism with Christianity and is contrary to the Christian belief of Christ defeating death, many devotees consider the veneration of San La Muerte as being part of their [[Catholic faith]]. The rituals connected and powers ascribed to San La Muerte are very similar to those of Santa Muerte; the resemblance between their names, however, is coincidental.\n\nIn [[Guatemala]], [[San Pascualito]] is a skeletal folk saint venerated as \"King of the Graveyard.\" He is depicted as a skeletal figure with a scythe, sometimes wearing a cape and crown. He is associated with death and the curing of diseases.\n\nIn the Brazilian religion [[Umbanda]], the [[orix\u00e1]] [[Omolu]] personifies sickness and death as well as healing. The image of the death is also associated with [[Eshu|Exu]], lord of the crossroads, who rules cemeteries and the hour of midnight.\n\nIn [[Haitian Vodou]], the [[Gu\u00e9d\u00e9]] are a family of spirits that embody death and fertility. The most well-known of these spirits is [[Baron Samedi]].\n\n===Slavic===\nIn [[Poland]], Death, or ''\u015amier\u0107'', has an appearance similar to the Grim Reaper, although \u015amier\u0107's robe is white instead of black. Because the word ''\u015bmier\u0107'' is feminine in gender, death is frequently portrayed as a skeletal old woman, as depicted in 15th-century [[dialogue]] [[Master Polikarp's Dialog with Death|''\"Rozmowa Mistrza Polikarpa ze \u015amierci\u0105\"'']] (Latin: ''\"Dialogus inter Mortem et Magistrum Polikarpum\"'').\n\nIn Serbia and other Slavic countries, the Grim Reaper is well known as ''Smrt'' (\"Death\") or ''Kosa\u010d'' (\"Billhook\"). Slavic people found this very similar to the Devil and other dark powers. One popular saying about death is: ''Smrt ne bira ni vreme, ni mesto, ni godinu'' (\"Death does not choose a time, place or year\" \u2013 which means death is destiny.){{original research inline|date=May 2017}}\n\n===The Low Countries===\nIn the [[Kingdom of the Netherlands|Netherlands]], and to a lesser extent in [[Belgium]], the personification of Death is known as ''Magere Hein'' (\"Meager Hein\") or Pietje de Dood (\"Peter the Death\").<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.vlaamswoordenboek.be/definities/term/Pietje+de+Dood|title=Het Vlaams woordenboek \u00bb Pietje de Dood|website=www.vlaamswoordenboek.be|access-date=2019-01-21}}</ref> Historically, he was sometimes simply referred to as ''Hein'' or variations thereof such as ''Heintje'', ''Heintjeman'' and ''Oom Hendrik'' (\"Uncle [[Henry (given name)|Hendrik]]\").

The designation \"Meager\" comes from its portrayal as a [[Skeleton (undead)|skeleton]], which was largely influenced by the Christian \"[[Dance of Death]]\" ([[Dutch language|Dutch]]: ''dodendans'') theme that was prominent in Europe during the late Middle Ages. \"Hein\" was a [[Middle Dutch]] name originating as a short form of ''Heinric'' (see [[Henry (given name)]]). Its use was possibly related to the comparable German concept of \"Freund Hein.\"{{Citation needed|date=December 2019}} Notably, many of the names given to Death can also refer to the Devil; it is likely that fear of death lead to Hein's character being merged with that of [[Satan]].<ref name=booze>{{cite book |last1=Niermeyer |first1=Antonie |date=1840 |title=Verhandeling over het booze wezen in het bijgeloof onzer natie: eene bijdrage tot de kennis onzer voorvaderlijke mythologie |trans-title=Treatise on the evil being in the superstition of our nation: a contribution to the knowledge of our ancestral mythology |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=n09bAAAAQAAJ |language=Dutch |location=[[Rotterdam]] |publisher=A.

He is also known as the King of [[Dharma|Karmic Justice]] (''Dharmaraja'') as one's [[karma]] at death was considered to lead to a just [[reincarnation|rebirth]]. Yama rides a black [[Water Buffalo|buffalo]] and carries a rope lasso to lead the [[soul]] back to his home, called [[Naraka (Hinduism)|Naraka]], pathalloka, or Yamaloka. There are many forms of reapers, although some say there is only one who disguises himself as a small child. His agents, the [[Yamaduta]]s, carry souls back to Yamalok. There, all the accounts of a person's good and bad deeds are stored and maintained by [[Chitragupta]]. The balance of these deeds allows Yama to decide where the soul should reside in its next life, following the theory of [[reincarnation]]. Yama is also mentioned in the [[Mahabharata]] as a great philosopher and devotee of the Supreme [[Brahman]].\n\nBuddhist scriptures also mention the figure [[Mara (demon)|Mara]] much in the same way.\n\n===East Asia===\n[[Yama (East Asia)|Yama]] was introduced to [[Chinese mythology]] through [[Buddhist mythology|Buddhism]]. In Chinese, he is known as [[King Yan]] (<small>[[traditional characters|t]]</small>&nbsp;{{lang|zh|{{linktext|\u95bb|\u738b}}}}, <small>[[simplified characters|s]]</small>&nbsp;{{lang|zh|{{linktext|\u960e|\u738b}}}}, <small>[[pinyin|p]]</small>&nbsp;''Y\u00e1nw\u00e1ng'') or [[Yanluo]] (<small>[[traditional characters|t]]</small>&nbsp;{{lang|zh|{{linktext|\u95bb\u7f85|\u738b}}}}, <small>[[simplified characters|s]]</small>&nbsp;{{lang|zh|{{linktext|\u960e\u7f57|\u738b}}}}, <small>[[pinyin|p]]</small>&nbsp;''Y\u00e1nlu\u00f3w\u00e1ng''), ruling the ten gods of the [[underworld]] [[Diyu]]. He is normally depicted wearing a Chinese judge's cap and [[hanfu|traditional Chinese robes]] and appears on most forms of [[hell money]] offered in [[Chinese ancestral veneration|ancestor worship]]. From China, Yama spread to [[Japanese mythology|Japan]] as the Great King Enma ({{lang|ja|{{linktext|\u95bb\u9b54|\u5927|\u738b}}}}, ''Enma-Dai-\u014c''), ruler of Jigoku ({{lang|ja|{{linktext|\u5730\u7344}}}}); [[Korean mythology|Korea]] as the Great King Y\u014fmna ({{lang|ko|{{linktext|\uc5fc\ub77c|\ub300|\uc655}}}}), ruler of Jiok ({{lang|ko|{{linktext|\uc9c0\uc625}}}}); and [[Vietnamese mythology|Vietnam]] as ''{{lang|vi|Di\u00eam La V\u01b0\u01a1ng}}'', ruler of ''{{lang|vi|\u0110\u1ecba Ng\u1ee5c}}'' or ''{{lang|vi|\u00c2m Ph\u1ee7}}''.\n\nSeparately, In [[Korean mythology]], death's principal figure is the \"Netherworld Emissary\" Jeoseung-saja ({{lang|ko|{{linktext|\uc800\uc2b9\uc0ac\uc790}}}}).

In I Chronicles 21:15 the \"angel of the Lord\" is seen by [[David|King David]] standing \"between the earth and the [[heaven]], having a drawn sword in his hand stretched out over [[Jerusalem]].\" The biblical [[Book of Job]] (33:22) uses the general term \"destroyers\" (''memitim''), which tradition has identified with \"destroying angels\" (''mal'ake Khabbalah''), and Prov. 16:14 uses the term the \"angels of death\" (''mal'ake ha-mavet'').

In the hour of death, he stands at the head of the departing one with a drawn sword, to which clings a drop of [[bile|gall]]. As soon as the dying man sees Death, he is seized with a convulsion and opens his mouth, whereupon Death throws the drop into it. This drop causes his death; he turns putrid, and his face becomes yellow.<ref>[[Talmud]] [[Avodah Zarah]] 20b; on putrefaction see also Pesikta de-Rav Kahana 54b; for the eyes compare Ezekiel 1:18 and [[Book of Revelation|Revelation]] 4:6</ref> The expression \"the taste of death\" originated in the idea that death was caused by a drop of gall.<ref>[[Jewish Quarterly Review]] vi. 327</ref>\n\nThe soul escapes through the mouth, or, as is stated in another place, through the throat; therefore, the Angel of Death stands at the head of the patient ([[Adolf Jellinek]], l.c. ii. 94, Midr. Teh. to Ps. xi.). When the soul forsakes the body, its voice goes from one end of the world to the other, but is not heard (Gen. R. vi. 7; Ex. R. v. 9; Pir\u1e33e R. El. xxxiv.). The drawn sword of the Angel of Death, mentioned by the Chronicler (I. Chron. 21:15; comp. Job 15:22; Enoch 62:11), indicates that the Angel of Death was figured as a warrior who kills off the children of men. \"Man, on the day of his death, falls down before the Angel of Death like a beast before the slaughterer\" ([[Gr\u00fcnhut]], \"Li\u1e33\u1e33u\u1e6dim\", v. 102a). R. Samuel's father (c. 200) said: \"The Angel of Death said to me, 'Only for the sake of the honor of mankind do I not tear off their necks as is done to slaughtered beasts'\" ('Ab. Zarah 20b). In later representations, the knife sometimes replaces the sword, and reference is also made to the cord of the Angel of Death, which indicates death by throttling. [[Moses]] says to God: \"I fear the cord of the Angel of Death\" (Gr\u00fcnhut, l.c. v. 103a et seq.). Of the four [[Jewish]] methods of execution, three are named in connection with the Angel of Death: Burning (by pouring hot lead down the victim's throat), slaughtering (by beheading), and throttling. The Angel of Death administers the particular punishment that God has ordained for the commission of sin.\n\nA peculiar [[Mantle (vesture)|mantle]] (\"idra\"\u2014according to Levy, \"Neuhebr. W\u00f6rterb.\" i. 32, a sword) belongs to the equipment of the Angel of Death ([[Ecclesiastes Rabbah|Eccl. R.]] iv. 7). The Angel of Death takes on the particular form which will best serve his purpose; e.g., he appears to a scholar in the form of a beggar imploring pity (the beggar should receive [[Tzedakah]])(M. \u1e32. 28a). \"When pestilence rages in the town, walk not in the middle of the street, because the Angel of Death [i.e., pestilence] strides there; if peace reigns in the town, walk not on the edges of the road. When pestilence rages in the town, go not alone to the synagogue, because there the Angel of Death stores his tools. If the dogs howl, the Angel of Death has entered the city; if they make sport, the prophet [[Elijah]] has come\" (B. \u1e32. 60b). The \"destroyer\" (''sa\u1e6dan ha-mash\u1e25it'') in the daily prayer is the Angel of Death (Ber. 16b). Midr. Ma'ase Torah (compare Jellinek, \"B. H.\" ii. 98) says: \"There are six Angels of Death: [[Gabriel]] over kings; \u1e32ap\u1e93iel over youths; Mashbir over animals; Mash\u1e25it over children; Af and \u1e24emah over man and beast.\"\n\n====Scholars and the Angel of Death====\n[[File:Paolo Monti - Serie fotografica (Venezia, 1951) - BEIC 6342929.jpg|thumb|''The Angel of Death'', sculpture of a funeral gondola, Venice. Photo by Paolo Monti, 1951.]]\n[[Talmud]] teachers of the 4th century associate quite familiarly with him. When he appeared to one on the street, the teacher reproached him with rushing upon him as upon a beast, whereupon the angel called upon him at his house. To another, he granted a respite of thirty days, that he might put his knowledge in order before entering the next world. To a third, he had no access, because he could not interrupt the study of the Talmud. To a fourth, he showed a rod of fire, whereby he is recognized as the Angel of Death (M. K. 28a). He often entered the house of Bibi and conversed with him (\u1e24ag. 4b). Often, he resorts to strategy in order to interrupt and seize his victim (B. M. 86a; Mak. 10a).\n\nThe death of [[Joshua ben Levi]] in particular is surrounded with a web of fable. When the time came for him to die and the Angel of Death appeared to him, he demanded to be shown his place in paradise. When the angel had consented to this, he demanded the angel's knife, that the angel might not frighten him by the way. This request also was granted him, and Joshua sprang with the knife over the wall of paradise; the angel, who is not allowed to enter paradise, caught hold of the end of his garment. Joshua swore that he would not come out, and God declared that he should not leave paradise unless he had ever absolved himself of an oath; he had never absolved himself of an oath so he was allowed to remain. The Angel of Death then demanded back his knife, but Joshua refused. At this point, a heavenly voice (''bat \u1e33ol'') rang out: \"Give him back the knife, because the children of men have need of it will bring death.\" Hesitant, Joshua Ben Levi gives back the knife in exchange for the Angel of Death's name. To never forget the name, he carved Troke into his arm, the Angel of Death's chosen name. When the knife was returned to the Angel, Joshua's carving of the name faded, and he forgot.\n(Ket. 77b; Jellinek, l.c. ii. 48\u201351; Bacher, l.c. i. 192 et seq.).\n\n====Rabbinic views====\nThe [[Rabbi]]s found the Angel of Death mentioned in [[Psalm]] 89:48, where the Targum translates: \"There is no man who lives and, seeing the Angel of Death, can deliver his soul from his hand.\" Eccl. 8:4 is thus explained in [[Midrash]] Rabbah to the passage: \"One may not escape the Angel of Death, nor say to him, 'Wait until I put my affairs in order,' or 'There is my son, my slave: take him in my stead.'\" Where the Angel of Death appears, there is no remedy, but his name ([[Talmud]], Ned. 49a; Hul. 7b). If one who has sinned has confessed his fault, the Angel of Death may not touch him ([[Tanhuma|Midrash Tanhuma]], ed. Buber, 139). God protects from the Angel of Death (Midrash [[Genesis Rabba]]h lxviii.).\n\nBy acts of benevolence, the anger of the Angel of Death is overcome; when one fails to perform such acts the Angel of Death will make his appearance (Derek Ere\u1e93 Zu\u1e6da, viii.). The Angel of Death receives his orders from God (Ber. 62b). As soon as he has received permission to destroy, however, he makes no distinction between good and bad (B. \u1e32. 60a). In the city of Luz, the Angel of Death has no power, and, when the aged inhabitants are ready to die, they go outside the city (So\u1e6dah 46b; compare Sanh. 97a). A legend to the same effect existed in Ireland in the Middle Ages (''[[Jewish Quarterly Review|Jew. Quart.

He and his many subordinates pull the souls out of the bodies, and guide them through the journey of the afterlife. Their appearance depends on the person's deed and actions, with those that did good seeing a beautiful being, and those that did wrong seeing a horrific monster.\n\nIslamic tradition discusses elaborately as to what exactly happens before, during, and after the death. The angel of death appears to the dying to take out their souls. The sinners' souls are extracted in a most painful way while the righteous are treated easily.<ref name=\"Stefon-83\">{{cite book |editor=Matt Stefon|title=Islamic Beliefs and Practices |url=https://archive.org/details/islamicbeliefspr0000stef|url-access=registration|publisher=[[Britannica Educational Publishing]] |year=2010 |location=[[New York City|New York]] |isbn=978-1-61530-060-0|pages=[https://archive.org/details/islamicbeliefspr0000stef/page/83 83\u201385]}}</ref> After the burial, two angels \u2013 [[Munkar and Nakir]] \u2013 come to question the dead in order to test their faith.

Other beliefs hold that the Spectre of Death is only a [[psychopomp]], serving to sever the last ties between the soul and the body, and to guide the deceased to the [[afterlife]], without having any control over when or how the victim dies.

Like her, he is seldom portrayed directly. He sometimes appears in art as a winged and bearded man, and occasionally as a winged and beardless youth. When he appears together with his twin brother, [[Hypnos]], the god of sleep, Thanatos generally represents a gentle death. Thanatos, led by [[Hermes (mythology)|Hermes ''psychopompos'']], takes the shade of the deceased to the near shore of the river [[Styx]], whence the boatman [[Charon (mythology)|Charon]], on [[Charon's obol|payment of a small fee]], conveys the shade to [[Hades]], the realm of the dead. Homer's ''[[Iliad]]'' 16.681, and the [[Euphronios Krater]]'s depiction of the same episode, have [[Apollo]] instruct the removal of the heroic, semi-divine [[Sarpedon#Son of Zeus and Laodamia|Sarpedon]]'s body from the battlefield by Hypnos and Thanatos, and conveyed thence to his homeland for proper funeral rites.{{citation needed|date=March 2018}} Among the other children of Nyx are Thanatos' sisters, the [[Keres (Greek mythology)|Keres]], blood-drinking, vengeant spirits of violent or untimely death, portrayed as fanged and taloned, with bloody garments.\n\n===Celtic===\n[[Image:Banshee.jpg|thumbnail|''Bunworth Banshee'', \"Fairy Legends and Traditions of the South of Ireland\", by Thomas Crofton Croker, 1825]]\nIn [[Bretons|Breton]] folklore, a spectral figure called the [[Ankou]] (''yr Angau'' in [[Welsh language|Welsh]]) portends death. Usually, the Ankou is the spirit of the last person that died within the community and appears as a tall, haggard figure with a wide hat and long white hair or a skeleton with a revolving head. The Ankou drives a deathly wagon or cart with a creaking axle. The cart or wagon is piled high with corpses and a stop at a cabin means instant death for those inside.<ref>Anatole Le Braz : L\u00e9gende de la Mort</ref>\n\nIrish mythology features a similar creature known as a [[dullahan]], whose head would be tucked under his or her arm (dullahans were not one, but an entire species). The head was said to have large eyes and a smile that could reach the head's ears. The dullahan would ride a black horse or a carriage pulled by black horses, and stop at the house of someone about to die, and call their name, and immediately the person would die. The dullahan did not like being watched, and it was believed that if a dullahan knew someone was watching them, they would lash that person's eyes with their whip, which was made from a spine; or they would toss a basin of blood on the person, which was a sign that the person was next to die.\n\nGaelic lore also involves a female [[spirit]] known as [[Banshee]] (Modern Irish Gaelic: ''bean s\u00ed'' pron. banshee, literally ''fairy woman''), who heralds the death of a person by shrieking or keening. The banshee is often described as wearing red or green, usually with long, disheveled hair. She can appear in a variety of forms, typically that of an ugly, frightful hag, but in some stories she chooses to appear young and beautiful. Some tales recount that the creature was actually a [[ghost]], often of a specific murdered woman or a mother who died in childbirth. When several banshees appeared at once, it was said to indicate the death of someone great or holy. In Ireland and parts of Scotland, a traditional part of mourning is the keening woman (bean chaointe), who wails a lament \u2013 in [[Irish language|Irish]]: Caoineadh, caoin meaning \"to weep, to wail.\" \n\nIn Scottish folklore there was a belief that a black, dark green or white dog known as a [[C\u00f9 S\u00ecth]] took dying souls to the afterlife. Comparable figures exist in Irish and [[C\u0175n Annwn|Welsh]] stories.\n\nIn Welsh Folklore, Gwyn ap Nudd is the escort of the grave, the personification of Death and Winter who leads the wild hunt to collect wayward souls and escort them to the Otherworld, sometimes it is Melwas, Arawn or Afallach in a similar position.\n\n==American use of the grim reaper==\n\nThe grim reaper is depicted as a skeleton with a black cloak which symbolizes death and evil. He carries a [[sickle]] which meant people to be killed and die.\n\n===Latin America===\n[[File:Posada2.Catrina.jpeg|thumbnail|[[La Calavera Catrina]]]]\n\nAs is the case in many [[Romance languages]] (including French, Portuguese, Italian, and Romanian), the Spanish word for death, ''muerte,'' is a [[Grammatical gender in Spanish|feminine noun]]. As such, it is common in Spanish-speaking cultures to personify death as a female figure. \n\nIn [[Aztec mythology]], [[Mict\u0113cacihu\u0101tl|Mictecacihuatl]] is the \"[[Queen regnant|Queen]] of [[Mictlan]]\" (the Aztec [[underworld]]), ruling over the [[afterlife]] with her husband [[Mictlantecuhtli]]. Other epithets for her include \"Lady of the Dead,\" as her role includes keeping watch over the bones of the dead. Mictecacihuatl was represented with a fleshless body and with jaw agape to swallow the stars during the day. She presided over the ancient festivals of the dead, which evolved from Aztec traditions into the modern [[Day of the Dead]] after synthesis with Spanish cultural traditions.{{Citation needed|date=December 2019}}\n\n[[Santa Muerte|Our Lady of the Holy Death]] (Santa Muerte) is a female [[deity]] or [[folk saint]] of Mexican folk religion, whose popularity has been growing in [[Mexico]] and the [[United States]] in recent years. Since the [[pre-Columbian era]], Mexican culture has maintained a certain reverence towards death, as seen in the widespread commemoration of the Day of the Dead. [[La Calavera Catrina]], a character symbolizing death, is also an icon of the Mexican Day of the Dead.\n\n[[San La Muerte]] (Saint Death) is a skeletal folk saint venerated in [[Paraguay]], northeast [[Argentina]], and southern [[Brazil]]. As the result of internal migration in Argentina since the 1960s, the veneration of San La Muerte has been extended to [[Greater Buenos Aires]] and the national prison system as well. Saint Death is depicted as a male skeleton figure usually holding a [[scythe]]. Although the [[Catholic Church]] in Mexico has attacked the devotion of Saint Death as a tradition that mixes paganism with Christianity and is contrary to the Christian belief of Christ defeating death, many devotees consider the veneration of San La Muerte as being part of their [[Catholic faith]]. The rituals connected and powers ascribed to San La Muerte are very similar to those of Santa Muerte; the resemblance between their names, however, is coincidental.\n\nIn [[Guatemala]], [[San Pascualito]] is a skeletal folk saint venerated as \"King of the Graveyard.\" He is depicted as a skeletal figure with a scythe, sometimes wearing a cape and crown. He is associated with death and the curing of diseases.\n\nIn the Brazilian religion [[Umbanda]], the [[orix\u00e1]] [[Omolu]] personifies sickness and death as well as healing. The image of the death is also associated with [[Eshu|Exu]], lord of the crossroads, who rules cemeteries and the hour of midnight.\n\nIn [[Haitian Vodou]], the [[Gu\u00e9d\u00e9]] are a family of spirits that embody death and fertility. The most well-known of these spirits is [[Baron Samedi]].\n\n===Slavic===\nIn [[Poland]], Death, or ''\u015amier\u0107'', has an appearance similar to the Grim Reaper, although \u015amier\u0107's robe is white instead of black. Because the word ''\u015bmier\u0107'' is feminine in gender, death is frequently portrayed as a skeletal old woman, as depicted in 15th-century [[dialogue]] [[Master Polikarp's Dialog with Death|''\"Rozmowa Mistrza Polikarpa ze \u015amierci\u0105\"'']] (Latin: ''\"Dialogus inter Mortem et Magistrum Polikarpum\"'').\n\nIn Serbia and other Slavic countries, the Grim Reaper is well known as ''Smrt'' (\"Death\") or ''Kosa\u010d'' (\"Billhook\"). Slavic people found this very similar to the Devil and other dark powers. One popular saying about death is: ''Smrt ne bira ni vreme, ni mesto, ni godinu'' (\"Death does not choose a time, place or year\" \u2013 which means death is destiny.){{original research inline|date=May 2017}}\n\n===The Low Countries===\nIn the [[Kingdom of the Netherlands|Netherlands]], and to a lesser extent in [[Belgium]], the personification of Death is known as ''Magere Hein'' (\"Meager Hein\") or Pietje de Dood (\"Peter the Death\").<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.vlaamswoordenboek.be/definities/term/Pietje+de+Dood|title=Het Vlaams woordenboek \u00bb Pietje de Dood|website=www.vlaamswoordenboek.be|access-date=2019-01-21}}</ref> Historically, he was sometimes simply referred to as ''Hein'' or variations thereof such as ''Heintje'', ''Heintjeman'' and ''Oom Hendrik'' (\"Uncle [[Henry (given name)|Hendrik]]\").

The designation \"Meager\" comes from its portrayal as a [[Skeleton (undead)|skeleton]], which was largely influenced by the Christian \"[[Dance of Death]]\" ([[Dutch language|Dutch]]: ''dodendans'') theme that was prominent in Europe during the late Middle Ages. \"Hein\" was a [[Middle Dutch]] name originating as a short form of ''Heinric'' (see [[Henry (given name)]]). Its use was possibly related to the comparable German concept of \"Freund Hein.\"{{Citation needed|date=December 2019}} Notably, many of the names given to Death can also refer to the Devil; it is likely that fear of death lead to Hein's character being merged with that of [[Satan]].<ref name=booze>{{cite book |last1=Niermeyer |first1=Antonie |date=1840 |title=Verhandeling over het booze wezen in het bijgeloof onzer natie: eene bijdrage tot de kennis onzer voorvaderlijke mythologie |trans-title=Treatise on the evil being in the superstition of our nation: a contribution to the knowledge of our ancestral mythology |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=n09bAAAAQAAJ |language=Dutch |location=[[Rotterdam]] |publisher=A.

The legend tells that Giltin\u0117 was young, pretty, and communicative until she was trapped in a coffin for seven years. Her sister was the goddess of life and destiny, [[Laima]], symbolizing the relationship between beginning and end.\n\nLike the Scandinavians, Lithuanians and Latvians later began using Grim Reaper imagery for death.\n\n===India===\n[[File:Yama's Court and Hell.jpg|thumb|left|[[Yama (Hinduism)|Yama]], the Hindu lord of death, presiding over his court in hell]]\nThe Sanskrit word for death is ''mrityu'' (cognate with Latin ''mors'' and Lithuanian ''mirtis''), which is often personified in [[Dharmic religions]].\n\nIn [[Hinduism|Hindu]] scriptures, the lord of death is called [[Yama (Hinduism)|King Yama]] ({{lang|sk|\u092f\u092e \u0930\u093e\u091c}}, ''Yama R\u0101j\u0101''). He is also known as the King of [[Dharma|Karmic Justice]] (''Dharmaraja'') as one's [[karma]] at death was considered to lead to a just [[reincarnation|rebirth]]. Yama rides a black [[Water Buffalo|buffalo]] and carries a rope lasso to lead the [[soul]] back to his home, called [[Naraka (Hinduism)|Naraka]], pathalloka, or Yamaloka. There are many forms of reapers, although some say there is only one who disguises himself as a small child. His agents, the [[Yamaduta]]s, carry souls back to Yamalok. There, all the accounts of a person's good and bad deeds are stored and maintained by [[Chitragupta]]. The balance of these deeds allows Yama to decide where the soul should reside in its next life, following the theory of [[reincarnation]]. Yama is also mentioned in the [[Mahabharata]] as a great philosopher and devotee of the Supreme [[Brahman]].\n\nBuddhist scriptures also mention the figure [[Mara (demon)|Mara]] much in the same way.\n\n===East Asia===\n[[Yama (East Asia)|Yama]] was introduced to [[Chinese mythology]] through [[Buddhist mythology|Buddhism]]. In Chinese, he is known as [[King Yan]] (<small>[[traditional characters|t]]</small>&nbsp;{{lang|zh|{{linktext|\u95bb|\u738b}}}}, <small>[[simplified characters|s]]</small>&nbsp;{{lang|zh|{{linktext|\u960e|\u738b}}}}, <small>[[pinyin|p]]</small>&nbsp;''Y\u00e1nw\u00e1ng'') or [[Yanluo]] (<small>[[traditional characters|t]]</small>&nbsp;{{lang|zh|{{linktext|\u95bb\u7f85|\u738b}}}}, <small>[[simplified characters|s]]</small>&nbsp;{{lang|zh|{{linktext|\u960e\u7f57|\u738b}}}}, <small>[[pinyin|p]]</small>&nbsp;''Y\u00e1nlu\u00f3w\u00e1ng''), ruling the ten gods of the [[underworld]] [[Diyu]]. He is normally depicted wearing a Chinese judge's cap and [[hanfu|traditional Chinese robes]] and appears on most forms of [[hell money]] offered in [[Chinese ancestral veneration|ancestor worship]]. From China, Yama spread to [[Japanese mythology|Japan]] as the Great King Enma ({{lang|ja|{{linktext|\u95bb\u9b54|\u5927|\u738b}}}}, ''Enma-Dai-\u014c''), ruler of Jigoku ({{lang|ja|{{linktext|\u5730\u7344}}}}); [[Korean mythology|Korea]] as the Great King Y\u014fmna ({{lang|ko|{{linktext|\uc5fc\ub77c|\ub300|\uc655}}}}), ruler of Jiok ({{lang|ko|{{linktext|\uc9c0\uc625}}}}); and [[Vietnamese mythology|Vietnam]] as ''{{lang|vi|Di\u00eam La V\u01b0\u01a1ng}}'', ruler of ''{{lang|vi|\u0110\u1ecba Ng\u1ee5c}}'' or ''{{lang|vi|\u00c2m Ph\u1ee7}}''.\n\nSeparately, In [[Korean mythology]], death's principal figure is the \"Netherworld Emissary\" Jeoseung-saja ({{lang|ko|{{linktext|\uc800\uc2b9\uc0ac\uc790}}}}).

After an argument, she promised she would take a thousand lives every day, becoming a goddess of death. There are also death gods called [[shinigami]] (\u6b7b\u795e), which are closer to the Western tradition of the Grim Reaper; while common in modern Japanese arts and fiction, they were essentially absent in traditional mythology.\n\n==In Abrahamic religions==<!-- This section is linked from [[Angel]] -->\n{{see also|Destroying angel (Bible)}}\nThe \"[[Angel of the Lord]]\" smites 185,000 men in the [[Assyria]]n camp (II Kings 19:35).

In the hour of death, he stands at the head of the departing one with a drawn sword, to which clings a drop of [[bile|gall]]. As soon as the dying man sees Death, he is seized with a convulsion and opens his mouth, whereupon Death throws the drop into it. This drop causes his death; he turns putrid, and his face becomes yellow.<ref>[[Talmud]] [[Avodah Zarah]] 20b; on putrefaction see also Pesikta de-Rav Kahana 54b; for the eyes compare Ezekiel 1:18 and [[Book of Revelation|Revelation]] 4:6</ref> The expression \"the taste of death\" originated in the idea that death was caused by a drop of gall.<ref>[[Jewish Quarterly Review]] vi. 327</ref>\n\nThe soul escapes through the mouth, or, as is stated in another place, through the throat; therefore, the Angel of Death stands at the head of the patient ([[Adolf Jellinek]], l.c. ii. 94, Midr. Teh. to Ps. xi.). When the soul forsakes the body, its voice goes from one end of the world to the other, but is not heard (Gen. R. vi. 7; Ex. R. v. 9; Pir\u1e33e R. El. xxxiv.). The drawn sword of the Angel of Death, mentioned by the Chronicler (I. Chron. 21:15; comp. Job 15:22; Enoch 62:11), indicates that the Angel of Death was figured as a warrior who kills off the children of men. \"Man, on the day of his death, falls down before the Angel of Death like a beast before the slaughterer\" ([[Gr\u00fcnhut]], \"Li\u1e33\u1e33u\u1e6dim\", v. 102a). R. Samuel's father (c. 200) said: \"The Angel of Death said to me, 'Only for the sake of the honor of mankind do I not tear off their necks as is done to slaughtered beasts'\" ('Ab. Zarah 20b). In later representations, the knife sometimes replaces the sword, and reference is also made to the cord of the Angel of Death, which indicates death by throttling. [[Moses]] says to God: \"I fear the cord of the Angel of Death\" (Gr\u00fcnhut, l.c. v. 103a et seq.). Of the four [[Jewish]] methods of execution, three are named in connection with the Angel of Death: Burning (by pouring hot lead down the victim's throat), slaughtering (by beheading), and throttling. The Angel of Death administers the particular punishment that God has ordained for the commission of sin.\n\nA peculiar [[Mantle (vesture)|mantle]] (\"idra\"\u2014according to Levy, \"Neuhebr. W\u00f6rterb.\" i. 32, a sword) belongs to the equipment of the Angel of Death ([[Ecclesiastes Rabbah|Eccl. R.]] iv. 7). The Angel of Death takes on the particular form which will best serve his purpose; e.g., he appears to a scholar in the form of a beggar imploring pity (the beggar should receive [[Tzedakah]])(M. \u1e32. 28a). \"When pestilence rages in the town, walk not in the middle of the street, because the Angel of Death [i.e., pestilence] strides there; if peace reigns in the town, walk not on the edges of the road. When pestilence rages in the town, go not alone to the synagogue, because there the Angel of Death stores his tools. If the dogs howl, the Angel of Death has entered the city; if they make sport, the prophet [[Elijah]] has come\" (B. \u1e32. 60b). The \"destroyer\" (''sa\u1e6dan ha-mash\u1e25it'') in the daily prayer is the Angel of Death (Ber. 16b). Midr. Ma'ase Torah (compare Jellinek, \"B. H.\" ii. 98) says: \"There are six Angels of Death: [[Gabriel]] over kings; \u1e32ap\u1e93iel over youths; Mashbir over animals; Mash\u1e25it over children; Af and \u1e24emah over man and beast.\"\n\n====Scholars and the Angel of Death====\n[[File:Paolo Monti - Serie fotografica (Venezia, 1951) - BEIC 6342929.jpg|thumb|''The Angel of Death'', sculpture of a funeral gondola, Venice. Photo by Paolo Monti, 1951.]]\n[[Talmud]] teachers of the 4th century associate quite familiarly with him. When he appeared to one on the street, the teacher reproached him with rushing upon him as upon a beast, whereupon the angel called upon him at his house. To another, he granted a respite of thirty days, that he might put his knowledge in order before entering the next world. To a third, he had no access, because he could not interrupt the study of the Talmud. To a fourth, he showed a rod of fire, whereby he is recognized as the Angel of Death (M. K. 28a). He often entered the house of Bibi and conversed with him (\u1e24ag. 4b). Often, he resorts to strategy in order to interrupt and seize his victim (B. M. 86a; Mak. 10a).\n\nThe death of [[Joshua ben Levi]] in particular is surrounded with a web of fable. When the time came for him to die and the Angel of Death appeared to him, he demanded to be shown his place in paradise. When the angel had consented to this, he demanded the angel's knife, that the angel might not frighten him by the way. This request also was granted him, and Joshua sprang with the knife over the wall of paradise; the angel, who is not allowed to enter paradise, caught hold of the end of his garment. Joshua swore that he would not come out, and God declared that he should not leave paradise unless he had ever absolved himself of an oath; he had never absolved himself of an oath so he was allowed to remain. The Angel of Death then demanded back his knife, but Joshua refused. At this point, a heavenly voice (''bat \u1e33ol'') rang out: \"Give him back the knife, because the children of men have need of it will bring death.\" Hesitant, Joshua Ben Levi gives back the knife in exchange for the Angel of Death's name. To never forget the name, he carved Troke into his arm, the Angel of Death's chosen name. When the knife was returned to the Angel, Joshua's carving of the name faded, and he forgot.\n(Ket. 77b; Jellinek, l.c. ii. 48\u201351; Bacher, l.c. i. 192 et seq.).\n\n====Rabbinic views====\nThe [[Rabbi]]s found the Angel of Death mentioned in [[Psalm]] 89:48, where the Targum translates: \"There is no man who lives and, seeing the Angel of Death, can deliver his soul from his hand.\" Eccl. 8:4 is thus explained in [[Midrash]] Rabbah to the passage: \"One may not escape the Angel of Death, nor say to him, 'Wait until I put my affairs in order,' or 'There is my son, my slave: take him in my stead.'\" Where the Angel of Death appears, there is no remedy, but his name ([[Talmud]], Ned. 49a; Hul. 7b). If one who has sinned has confessed his fault, the Angel of Death may not touch him ([[Tanhuma|Midrash Tanhuma]], ed. Buber, 139). God protects from the Angel of Death (Midrash [[Genesis Rabba]]h lxviii.).\n\nBy acts of benevolence, the anger of the Angel of Death is overcome; when one fails to perform such acts the Angel of Death will make his appearance (Derek Ere\u1e93 Zu\u1e6da, viii.). The Angel of Death receives his orders from God (Ber. 62b). As soon as he has received permission to destroy, however, he makes no distinction between good and bad (B. \u1e32. 60a). In the city of Luz, the Angel of Death has no power, and, when the aged inhabitants are ready to die, they go outside the city (So\u1e6dah 46b; compare Sanh. 97a). A legend to the same effect existed in Ireland in the Middle Ages (''[[Jewish Quarterly Review|Jew. Quart.

Their appearance depends on the person's deed and actions, with those that did good seeing a beautiful being, and those that did wrong seeing a horrific monster.\n\nIslamic tradition discusses elaborately as to what exactly happens before, during, and after the death.
