Created by Maddocks Cartoon Productions, it originally ran for 25 episodes between 1986 and 1987. The premise of the cartoon is that Jimbo was originally intended to be a [[Boeing 747|Jumbo Jet]], but his designer could not tell the difference between inches and centimetres, resulting in his diminutive size.\n\nThe television series features various anthropomorphic airport ground vehicles: Tommy Tow-Truck, Claude Catering, Amanda Baggage, Phil the Fuel Truck, Sammy Steps and Harry Helicopter. Other plane characters appear from time to time, such as Old Timer, a [[Vickers Wellington]] bomber who gets into the story while flying to or from an [[airshow]]; and Gloria, a female counterpart to Jimbo. The story is based at a fictional \"London Airport\", under the command of an irate controller who frequently ends episodes screaming \"I want words with you, Jimbo!\"\n\n== Credits ==\n; Created, Written and Produced by: Peter Maddocks\n; Music: [[Roger Greenaway]], [[Gavin Greenaway]]\n; Series Animation by: Clive Dawson, Julian Gibbs, Neil Salmon, William Mobberley\n; Backgrounds: Kevin Smith\n; Camera: Chris Williams\n; Editing: Keith Learner\n; Trace & Paint: Guy Maddocks, Vivienne Dempsey, Simon Maddocks\n; Directed by: Keith Learner\n; Voices: Peter Hawkins & Susan Sheridan\n\n==Episode listing==\n{|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center; font-size:95%\"\n|-\n!{{abbr|No.|Number}}\n!Title\n!Air date\n!Summary\n|-\n|1\n|style=\"text-align:left;\"|\"The Little Big Problem\"\n|{{nowrap|6 January 1986}}\n|style=\"text-align:left;\"|The origin of how Jimbo came to be starts out at the aircraft factory, where the technicians use centimetres instead of inches, resulting in \"half a Jumbo\".\n|-\n|2\n|style=\"text-align:left;\"|\"Trouble at Sea\"\n|{{nowrap|7 January 1986}}\n|style=\"text-align:left;\"|One day whilst crossing the Atlantic, Jimbo sees a ship in distress and frantically does all he can to gather help to save it.\n|-\n|3\n|style=\"text-align:left;\"|\"First Time Fliers\"\n|{{nowrap|8 January 1986}}\n|style=\"text-align:left;\"|Jimbo is to take a class of children on their first ever flight.

Created by Maddocks Cartoon Productions, it originally ran for 25 episodes between 1986 and 1987. The premise of the cartoon is that Jimbo was originally intended to be a [[Boeing 747|Jumbo Jet]], but his designer could not tell the difference between inches and centimetres, resulting in his diminutive size.\n\nThe television series features various anthropomorphic airport ground vehicles: Tommy Tow-Truck, Claude Catering, Amanda Baggage, Phil the Fuel Truck, Sammy Steps and Harry Helicopter. Other plane characters appear from time to time, such as Old Timer, a [[Vickers Wellington]] bomber who gets into the story while flying to or from an [[airshow]]; and Gloria, a female counterpart to Jimbo. The story is based at a fictional \"London Airport\", under the command of an irate controller who frequently ends episodes screaming \"I want words with you, Jimbo!\"\n\n== Credits ==\n; Created, Written and Produced by: Peter Maddocks\n; Music: [[Roger Greenaway]], [[Gavin Greenaway]]\n; Series Animation by: Clive Dawson, Julian Gibbs, Neil Salmon, William Mobberley\n; Backgrounds: Kevin Smith\n; Camera: Chris Williams\n; Editing: Keith Learner\n; Trace & Paint: Guy Maddocks, Vivienne Dempsey, Simon Maddocks\n; Directed by: Keith Learner\n; Voices: Peter Hawkins & Susan Sheridan\n\n==Episode listing==\n{|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center; font-size:95%\"\n|-\n!{{abbr|No.|Number}}\n!Title\n!Air date\n!Summary\n|-\n|1\n|style=\"text-align:left;\"|\"The Little Big Problem\"\n|{{nowrap|6 January 1986}}\n|style=\"text-align:left;\"|The origin of how Jimbo came to be starts out at the aircraft factory, where the technicians use centimetres instead of inches, resulting in \"half a Jumbo\".\n|-\n|2\n|style=\"text-align:left;\"|\"Trouble at Sea\"\n|{{nowrap|7 January 1986}}\n|style=\"text-align:left;\"|One day whilst crossing the Atlantic, Jimbo sees a ship in distress and frantically does all he can to gather help to save it.\n|-\n|3\n|style=\"text-align:left;\"|\"First Time Fliers\"\n|{{nowrap|8 January 1986}}\n|style=\"text-align:left;\"|Jimbo is to take a class of children on their first ever flight.

The explosion killed Angela Taylor, the first Australian policewoman to be killed in the line of duty. The materials for the bomb were stolen from Tyrconnel Mine. Several men were arrested for suspected involvement with the bombing. Stanley Taylor and Craig Minogue were convicted of murder and various other offences related to the bombing.  Peter Reed and Rodney Minogue were acquitted of any offences related to the bombing but Reed was convicted of a number of offences related to his arrest, which involved a shootout with police officers injuring himself and an officer.

The explosion caused a massive amount of damage to the police station and surrounding buildings, estimated at more than A$1&nbsp;million. The Melbourne newspaper ''[[The Age]]'' reported that the blast's impact was enhanced by the open-floor design of the offices, which had acted like a [[M18A1 Claymore Antipersonnel Mine|Claymore mine]], sending more shrapnel as the blast ripped through the floors and adding more pressure to the blast as it followed its path. The blast seriously injured 21-year-old  [[Constable|Police Constable]] Angela Taylor, who died on 20 April, becoming the first Australian policewoman to be killed in the line of duty.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.theage.com.au/articles/2006/03/24/1143083990293.html|title=Remembering the day Russell Street shook|work=The Age|date=25 March 2006|accessdate=12 March 2008}}</ref><ref>[http://www.abc.net.au/news/2016-03-24/scars-still-felt-20-years-after-russell-street-bombing/7264058 Scars still felt 30 years after Russell Street bombing], [[Australian Broadcasting Corporation]], 24 March 2016</ref> 22 other people were injured.\n{{clear left}}\n\n==Investigations==\nOn 7 October 1985, [[gelignite]] and [[detonator]]s were stolen from the Tyrconnel Mine at Blackwood.

The motive for the bombing seems to have been revenge against the police<ref>[http://www.slv.vic.gov.au/ergo/russell_street_bombing The Russell Street bombing], slv.vic.gov.au; accessed 10 February 2016.</ref>.\n\nA week after the bombing, on the 4 April 1986, a anonymous caller had contacted the taskforce detectives stating that they had saw the offenders responsible just before the explosion, the caller then stated they wanted [[Australian dollar | AU$]]500,000 for the information. The caller called the taskforce on several times, the detectives traced the calls coming from a series of public phone boxes in and around the [[St. Kilda, Victoria | St. Kilda]] area. The caller was later identified as 38 year-old pharmacist; Vladimir Rhychta who was later arrested on the 16 April 1986 and charged with hindering a police investigation as it was found that Rhychta's information was false.<ref name=\"Foresnic\">''Forensic Investigators'' - ''S02 Ep06 Russell Street Bombing''</ref><ref>[http://www.timetoast.com/timelines/the-events-of-the-russell-street-bombing The Events of the Russell Street Bombing], timetoast.com</ref>\n\nThe taskforce then received information from a second witness who stated that they seen a male suspect driving a Commodore identical to the bomb car just before the bombing, the witness' description was enough to provide detectives with an [[identikit]] picture of the suspect, the identikit matched the description of career criminal; Claudio Crupi. Crupi was a career armed robber who had a hatred towards police, prior to the bombing, Crupi had been charged with a burglary and was on bail.<ref>{{Cite news |url=http://www.theage.com.au/national/victoria/the-day-terror-came-to-melbourne-the-russell-street-bombing-30-years-on-and-the-murder-of-angela-taylor-20160223-gn15xs.html|title=The day terror came to Melbourne: The Russell Street Bombing 30 years on and the murder of Angela Taylor|last=Silvester|first=John|date=2016-02-23|work=The Age|language=en-US}}</ref> In a raid on Crupi's home, taskforce detectives found a homemade device on Crupi's kitchen table. Crupi was later arrested by detectives in Sydney and was brought back to Melbourne. Under police questioning, Crupi admitted that he had a hatred towards a detective who worked at Russell Street but stated that the homemade device recovered in his home was a fake and was meant to planted at a police station in [[Flemington, Victoria | Flemington]].\n\nA major breakthrough in the investigation came from a police report filed three weeks prior to the bombing. On the 6 March 1986, a Victoria  Police Traffic unit was in pursuit of a stolen red [[Daimler Sovereign]] in [[East Keilor, Victoria | East Keilor]], the pursuit came to the end when the Daimler crashed. The driver fled on foot for a few kilometres where he carjacked a passing motorist at gunpoint. In the boot of the Daimler, police found a [[backpack]], containing a set of [[Vehicle registration plates of Victoria | number plates]] that had been cut into pieces. The pieces of the number plates; CCH-997 matched to a silver [[Holden Commodore (VK) | VK Commodore]] that had also been stolen before the bombing. This second Commodore matched the description of a vehicle being used in a armed robbery of a bank in [[Donvale, Victoria | Donvale]] hours after the bombing in which the Commodore was used to crash into the front window of the bank. The vehicle was later recovered from the [[Yarra River]] at [[Wonga Park, Victoria | Wonga Park]] on the 7 April 1986. \n\nUpon the examination of the silver Commodore by the Victoria Police Stolen Motor Vehicles Squad, detectives discovered that the vehicle's [[Vehicle identification number | VIN]] on the chassis had been drilled out. The drill marks on the silver Commodore's VIN were found to be identical to the VIN on the Commodore used in the bombing and the silver Commodore's number plates were recovered from the Daimler.  \n\nIn a statement given to the detectives, the traffic officer caught a glimpse of the driver from the Daimler during the chase and out of a series of mugshots, identified the driver as armed robber; Peter Reed. Reed was known to the police and had being suspected in several armed robberies and car rebirthing scams.<ref>''The Russell Street Bombing''</ref>\n\n==Arrests==\nOn 25 April 1986, ten [[Victoria Police]] officers raided the [[Kallista, Victoria|Kallista]] home of Peter Michael Reed at 5:45 a.m. It was alleged that upon attempting to enforce the arrest by forcing entry to the premises, Reed produced a [[.455]] [[Smith & Wesson]] [[revolver]] and fired at police, seriously wounding Detective Sergeant Mark Wylie. Reed was then fired upon by Det. Sgt.

The explosion caused a massive amount of damage to the police station and surrounding buildings, estimated at more than A$1&nbsp;million. The Melbourne newspaper ''[[The Age]]'' reported that the blast's impact was enhanced by the open-floor design of the offices, which had acted like a [[M18A1 Claymore Antipersonnel Mine|Claymore mine]], sending more shrapnel as the blast ripped through the floors and adding more pressure to the blast as it followed its path.

The motive for the bombing seems to have been revenge against the police<ref>[http://www.slv.vic.gov.au/ergo/russell_street_bombing The Russell Street bombing], slv.vic.gov.au; accessed 10 February 2016.</ref>.\n\nA week after the bombing, on the 4 April 1986, a anonymous caller had contacted the taskforce detectives stating that they had saw the offenders responsible just before the explosion, the caller then stated they wanted [[Australian dollar | AU$]]500,000 for the information. The caller called the taskforce on several times, the detectives traced the calls coming from a series of public phone boxes in and around the [[St. Kilda, Victoria | St. Kilda]] area. The caller was later identified as 38 year-old pharmacist; Vladimir Rhychta who was later arrested on the 16 April 1986 and charged with hindering a police investigation as it was found that Rhychta's information was false.<ref name=\"Foresnic\">''Forensic Investigators'' - ''S02 Ep06 Russell Street Bombing''</ref><ref>[http://www.timetoast.com/timelines/the-events-of-the-russell-street-bombing The Events of the Russell Street Bombing], timetoast.com</ref>\n\nThe taskforce then received information from a second witness who stated that they seen a male suspect driving a Commodore identical to the bomb car just before the bombing, the witness' description was enough to provide detectives with an [[identikit]] picture of the suspect, the identikit matched the description of career criminal; Claudio Crupi. Crupi was a career armed robber who had a hatred towards police, prior to the bombing, Crupi had been charged with a burglary and was on bail.<ref>{{Cite news |url=http://www.theage.com.au/national/victoria/the-day-terror-came-to-melbourne-the-russell-street-bombing-30-years-on-and-the-murder-of-angela-taylor-20160223-gn15xs.html|title=The day terror came to Melbourne: The Russell Street Bombing 30 years on and the murder of Angela Taylor|last=Silvester|first=John|date=2016-02-23|work=The Age|language=en-US}}</ref> In a raid on Crupi's home, taskforce detectives found a homemade device on Crupi's kitchen table. Crupi was later arrested by detectives in Sydney and was brought back to Melbourne. Under police questioning, Crupi admitted that he had a hatred towards a detective who worked at Russell Street but stated that the homemade device recovered in his home was a fake and was meant to planted at a police station in [[Flemington, Victoria | Flemington]].\n\nA major breakthrough in the investigation came from a police report filed three weeks prior to the bombing. On the 6 March 1986, a Victoria  Police Traffic unit was in pursuit of a stolen red [[Daimler Sovereign]] in [[East Keilor, Victoria | East Keilor]], the pursuit came to the end when the Daimler crashed. The driver fled on foot for a few kilometres where he carjacked a passing motorist at gunpoint. In the boot of the Daimler, police found a [[backpack]], containing a set of [[Vehicle registration plates of Victoria | number plates]] that had been cut into pieces. The pieces of the number plates; CCH-997 matched to a silver [[Holden Commodore (VK) | VK Commodore]] that had also been stolen before the bombing. This second Commodore matched the description of a vehicle being used in a armed robbery of a bank in [[Donvale, Victoria | Donvale]] hours after the bombing in which the Commodore was used to crash into the front window of the bank. The vehicle was later recovered from the [[Yarra River]] at [[Wonga Park, Victoria | Wonga Park]] on the 7 April 1986.\n\nUpon the examination of the silver Commodore by the Victoria Police Stolen Motor Vehicles Squad, detectives discovered that the vehicle's VIN on the chassis had been drilled out. The drill marks on the silver Commodore's chassis were found to be identical to the Commodore used in the bombing, providing a link between the Donvale robbery, the stolen Daimler, and the Russell Street Bombing.\n\nIn a statement given to the detectives, the traffic officer caught a glimpse of the driver from the Daimler during the chase and out of a series of mugshots, identified the driver as armed robber; Peter Reed. Reed was known to the police and had being suspected in several armed robberies and car rebirthing scams.<ref>''The Russell Street Bombing''</ref>\n\n==Arrests==\nOn 25 April 1986, ten [[Victoria Police]] officers raided the [[Kallista, Victoria|Kallista]] home of Peter Michael Reed at 5:45 a.m. It was alleged that upon attempting to enforce the arrest by forcing entry to the premises, Reed produced a [[.455]] [[Smith & Wesson]] [[revolver]] and fired at police, seriously wounding Detective Sergeant Mark Wylie. Reed was then fired upon by Det. Sgt. Quinsee, who was also wounded and arrested.\n\n==Trial==\nReed was charged with attempted murder, recklessly causing serious injury, using a firearm to prevent apprehension and possessing explosives in suspicious circumstances in addition to charges related to the Russell Street bombing.

Next to national floral symbols, there are also more specific [[Provinces of Indonesia|provincial]] floral emblems that represent each respective [[provinces of Indonesia]].\n\nIn addition, Indonesia also recognised [[Teak]] as the national tree.\n\n== Indonesian national floral emblems ==\nThere are three categories of [[floral emblem]] that symbolise Indonesia:\n#'''National flower''' ({{lang-id|Puspa bangsa}}) of [[Indonesia]] is ''[[Jasminum sambac|Melati putih]]'' (''Jasminum sambac''){{citation needed|date=July 2018}}\n#'''Flower of charm''' ({{lang-id|Puspa pesona}}) is ''Anggrek Bulan'' (Moon Orchid) (''[[Phalaenopsis amabilis]]''))<ref name=\"ASEANnationalflowers\">{{cite web|url=http://www.asean.org/18204.htm|title=ASEAN National Flowers|publisher=ASEAN|accessdate=8 June 2007|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120120052549/http://www.asean.org/18204.htm|archivedate=20 January 2012|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n#'''Rare flower''' ({{lang-id|Puspa langka}}) is ''Padma Raksasa Rafflesia'' (''[[Rafflesia arnoldii]]'').

Although the official adoption were announced only as early as 1990 during World Environment Day and enforced by law through Presidential Decree (''Keputusan Presiden'') No. 4 1993,<ref>[http://www.proxsis.com/perundangan/LH/doc/uu/F00-1993-00004.pdf Keputusan Presiden No. 4 Tahun 1993] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120402234237/http://www.proxsis.com/perundangan/LH/doc/uu/F00-1993-00004.pdf |date= 2 April 2012 }}</ref> the importance of ''Jasminum sambac'' in Indonesian culture predates its official adoption. Since the formation of Indonesian republic during the reign of Sukarno, ''melati putih'' is always unofficially recognised as the national flower of Indonesia. The reverence and the elevated status of this flower mostly due to the importance of ''jasminum sambac'' in Indonesian tradition since ancient times.\n\n''Melati putih'' is also the most important flower in wedding ceremonies for ethnic Indonesians, especially in the island of [[Java]].<ref name=\"fao\">{{cite web|url=http://www.fao.org/docrep/005/ac452e/ac452e05.htm|title=Cut Flower Production in Indonesia|author=Toto Sutater & Kusumah Effendie|publisher=Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations|accessdate=8 May 2011}}</ref> Jasmine flower buds that haven't fully opened are usually picked to create strings of jasmine garlands called ''roncen melati''. On wedding days, a traditional [[Javanese people|Javanese]] or [[Sundanese people|Sundanese]] bride's hair is adorned with strings of jasmine garlands arranged as a hairnet to cover the ''konde'' ([[Bun (hairstyle)|hair bun]]). The intricately intertwined strings of jasmine garlands are left to hang loose from the bride's head. The groom's [[kris]] is also adorned with five jasmine garlands called ''roncen usus-usus'' (intestine garlands) to refer its intestine-like form and also linked to the legend of [[Kris#Keris Setan Kober|Arya Penangsang]]. In Makassar and [[Bugis]] brides, the hair is also adorned with buds of jasmine that resemble pearls. Jasmine is also used as floral offerings for spirits and deities especially among [[Balinese people|Balinese]] [[Hinduism in Indonesia|Hindu]], and also often present during funerals.\n\nThe jasmine has wide spectrums in Indonesian traditions; it is the flower of life, beauty and festive wedding, yet it is also often associated with spirit and death. In Indonesian patriotic songs and poems, the fallen ''melati'' often hailed as the representation of fallen heroes that sacrificed their life for the country. The [[Ismail Marzuki]]'s  patriotic song ''\"Melati di Tapal Batas\"'' (jasmine on the border) (1947) and [[Guruh Sukarnoputra]]'s ''\"Melati Suci\"'' (sacred jasmine) (1974) clearly refer jasmine as the representation of fallen heroes, the eternally fragrance flower that adorned [[Ibu Pertiwi]] (Indonesian [[national personification]]). \n \nThe other two national flowers were chosen for different reasons. Moon Orchid was chosen for its beauty, while the other two rare flowers, ''Rafflesia arnoldii'' and ''Titan arum'' were chosen to demonstrate uniqueness and [[Flora of Indonesia|Indonesian floral biodiversity]].\n\n== Indonesian provinces floral emblems ==\nEach of 34 Provinces of Indonesia also have native plants used as floral emblems.

Although the official adoption were announced only as early as 1990 during World Environment Day and enforced by law through Presidential Decree (''Keputusan Presiden'') No. 4 1993,<ref>[http://www.proxsis.com/perundangan/LH/doc/uu/F00-1993-00004.pdf Keputusan Presiden No. 4 Tahun 1993] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120402234237/http://www.proxsis.com/perundangan/LH/doc/uu/F00-1993-00004.pdf |date= 2 April 2012 }}</ref> the importance of ''Jasminum sambac'' in Indonesian culture predates its official adoption. Since the formation of Indonesian republic during the reign of Sukarno, ''melati putih'' is always unofficially recognised as the national flower of Indonesia. The reverence and the elevated status of this flower mostly due to the importance of ''jasminum sambac'' in Indonesian tradition since ancient times.\n\n''Melati putih'' is also the most important flower in wedding ceremonies for ethnic Indonesians, especially in the island of [[Java]].<ref name=\"fao\">{{cite web|url=http://www.fao.org/docrep/005/ac452e/ac452e05.htm|title=Cut Flower Production in Indonesia|author=Toto Sutater & Kusumah Effendie|publisher=Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations|accessdate=8 May 2011}}</ref> Jasmine flower buds that haven't fully opened are usually picked to create strings of jasmine garlands called ''roncen melati''. On wedding days, a traditional [[Javanese people|Javanese]] or [[Sundanese people|Sundanese]] bride's hair is adorned with strings of jasmine garlands arranged as a hairnet to cover the ''konde'' ([[Bun (hairstyle)|hair bun]]). The intricately intertwined strings of jasmine garlands are left to hang loose from the bride's head. The groom's [[kris]] is also adorned with five jasmine garlands called ''roncen usus-usus'' (intestine garlands) to refer its intestine-like form and also linked to the legend of [[Kris#Keris Setan Kober|Arya Penangsang]]. In Makassar and [[Bugis]] brides, the hair is also adorned with buds of jasmine that resemble pearls. Jasmine is also used as floral offerings for spirits and deities especially among [[Balinese people|Balinese]] [[Hinduism in Indonesia|Hindu]], and also often present during funerals.\n\nThe jasmine has wide spectrums in Indonesian traditions; it is the flower of life, beauty and festive wedding, yet it is also often associated with spirit and death. In Indonesian patriotic songs and poems, the fallen ''melati'' often hailed as the representation of fallen heroes that sacrificed their life for the country. The [[Ismail Marzuki]]'s  patriotic song ''\"Melati di Tapal Batas\"'' (jasmine on the border) (1947) and [[Guruh Sukarnoputra]]'s ''\"Melati Suci\"'' (sacred jasmine) (1974) clearly refer jasmine as the representation of fallen heroes, the eternally fragrance flower that adorned [[Ibu Pertiwi]] (Indonesian [[national personification]]). \n \nThe other two national flowers were chosen for different reasons. Moon Orchid was chosen for its beauty, while the other two rare flowers, ''Rafflesia arnoldii'' and ''Titan arum'' were chosen to demonstrate uniqueness and [[Flora of Indonesia|Indonesian floral biodiversity]].\n\n== Indonesian provinces floral emblems ==\nEach of 34 Provinces of Indonesia also have native plants used as floral emblems.

The original idea for the show came from two ex-firemen from [[London]], England, who took their idea to artist and writer Rob Lee who developed the concept, and the show was commissioned.\n\n''Fireman Sam'' first appeared as '''{{lang|cy|Sam T\u00e2n}}''' (''Fireman Sam'' in Welsh) on [[S4C]] in 1987, and at the same time on [[BBC One]]. The original series finished in 1994, and a new series that expanded the character cast commenced in 2005. The series was also shown in [[Scottish Gaelic|Gaelic]] in Scotland. The series was sold to over 40 countries and has been used across the UK to promote [[fire safety]].\n\n==Development==\nThe original idea came about from two ex-firemen from [[London]], England \u2013 Dave Gingell and [[David Jones (writer)|David Jones]] after [[Commission (art)|purchasing]] the [[stop motion]] animation drawn by artist Anthony Miller and [[Will Vinton]]. They approached [[Mike Young (producer)|Mike Young]], creator of ''[[SuperTed]]'', in [[Barry, Vale of Glamorgan|Barry]], Wales, and asked them to further develop their concept. The idea was then brought to S4C's Director of Animation, Chris Grace, who had previously commissioned ''SuperTed'', saw potential in the idea and commissioned the series. The characters and storylines were created by Rob Lee, an illustrator from Cardiff, and the programme was made using [[stop motion]]. It could take up to four days to produce one minute of this form of puppet animation. ''Fireman Sam'' has to this day been translated into over 25 different languages including Mandarin.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.firemansamonline.com/uk/Parents/About_Sam/index.asp | title=About Sam | accessdate=4 January 2011}}</ref>\n\nIn the original series, all the character voices were performed by [[John Alderton]]. The later series used several actors' voices.\n\n==History==\n\n===Original series (1987\u20131994)===\nThe original series comprised 32 ten-minute episodes and a 20-minute [[Christmas special]]. The narration and all the character voices were done by [[John Alderton]].  Fireman Sam is the main character of the show, and interacts with both colleagues at the [[fire station]] and fellow villagers. He is seen as somewhat of a hero in the village. Despite being so small, and with so little activity, the village sees its fair share of fires, which Sam and his team can easily handle. The vehicles at the fire station include a four-wheeled [[Bedford TK]] fire engine called Jupiter, a six-wheeled 1982 [[TACR2 (Range Rover)|Range Rover Rescue Tender]] named Venus, and Trevor's Bus, a 1985 [[Ford Transit]] Dormobile. Fireman Sam's colleagues are Elvis Cridlington, Station Officer Basil Steele (renamed Norris Steele in the new [[Computer-generated imagery|CGI]] series) and later Penny Morris (who hailed from Newtown with the firetender). The villagers are bus driver/auxiliary firefighter Trevor Evans, Italian caf\u00e9 owner Bella Lasagne, Norman Price, Norman's mother Dilys Price, and the twins Sarah and James Jones. The objects include M.O.P., Bentley the Robot, and Mechanical Master Chef.\n\nThe original series aired on [[BBC One]], [[CBBC]] and [[CBeebies]] since it was launched in 1987, most commonly airing on CBeebies on a daily basis with repeats showing until 28 December 2007. In the original series produced by [[Bumper Films]] from 1987 to 1994, the firefighters had yellow and black uniforms, whereas in the 2005 series produced by Siriol Productions and [[Gullane Entertainment]] (Later [[HIT Entertainment]]) and the 2008 [[Computer-generated imagery|CGI]] series produced by [[HIT Entertainment]] (Later [[Mattel Creations]], then Mattel Television), Xing-Xing, [[WildBrain]] and [[DHX Media]], the firefighters now have yellow and blue uniforms.\n\nIn 1988, the original series was nominated for a BAFTA Award for Best Short Animated Film. The potential recipients were Ian Frampton and John Walker.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0329829/awards | title=Awards for \"Fireman Sam\" (1987) | accessdate=4 January 2011}}</ref>\n\n===2005 series===\nIn 2005, a new ''Fireman Sam'' series was produced by [[Calon (TV production company)|Siriol Productions]] for [[HIT Entertainment]], comprising twenty-six episodes, each ten minutes in length. These episodes used more modern techniques of stop motion [[clay animation|claymation]] including mouths that move with the dialogue. This series featured all the original characters, but also introduced some new faces, such as Tom Thomas, the Australian pilot of the rescue helicopter Wallaby One and the Mountain Rescue 4\u00d74 Jeep, an unnamed photographer/news reporter, and the Flood family; consisting of Mike The Plumber, his wife Helen The Nurse, and their daughter Mandy. The updated Jupiter has six wheels, loosely based on a Bedford 6\u00d74,{{citation needed|date=July 2016}} and Venus is loosely based on a heavily modified 4x4 [[Mini|Mini Cooper]]. The characters in this series were voiced by [[John Sparkes]], Joanna Ruiz and Sarah Hadland. The series also premiered on CBeebies in 2005 and repeats were shown until 2007.\n\n===CGI series (2008\u2013present)===\nThe series was revamped in 2008 which saw the show convert to [[Computer-generated imagery|CGI]]. Pontypandy is now a seaside fishing village instead of a village set deep in the hills, though most of the locations have retained their appearances. Another change in this series is that the twins' parents appear for the first time; their new-age mother Bronwyn, and fisherman father Charlie, Sam's brother, who runs a caf\u00e9/fish-and-chip shop called the 'Whole Fish Caf\u00e9'. The series was produced by Xing-Xing from 2008-2016 and [[DHX Media]] (Later [[WildBrain]])/IoM Media Ventures Halifax for [[HIT Entertainment]] (Later [[Mattel|Mattel Creations]], then Mattel Television) from 2017\u2013present\n\nJupiter was updated again, now with a front end taken from a Volvo FL6. A yellow stripe  was added to the front of the fire engine. Minor changes were made to Venus which included a water nozzle added to the top of its roof. Trevor's bus was updated to a more modern look with angled headlights. New vehicles introduced included Mike Flood's Van in the sixth season , as well as Mercury (fire quad bike), Saturn (infrared drone), The Pontypandy Flyer (Steam Locomotive), and Bessie (Steeles first fire engine) which were introduced from the eighth season onwards.\n\nThe outfits were updated throughout the series (except for Norman Price). This included an update to the firefighter's outfits which added reflective stripes and extra badges to their tunics. Dilys Price received a large makeover which saw her getting makeup, glasses, black hair, a necklace and an updated outfit. The rest of the characters also received minor updates to their clothing.\n\nMany characters also had aspects of their personalities made more apparent. Norman Price is far more mischievous and inconsiderate than in the 2005 series where his pranks were often planned out and his accidents were due to badly planned ideas instead of outrageous schemes. For example, in the episode \"Pontypandy Extreme\", Norman gets trapped down a [[wishing well]] after attempting to climb down in order to retrieve the coins from the bottom. Other examples are Station Officer Steele's strictness and maturity and Elvis's decrease in general competence. For example, in one episode where a first aid training exercise is taking place, Elvis is told off by Steele for dancing with the dummy that is being used. At the same time, Steele is not afraid to unleash the child within him, showing an interest in kite flying and paper planes. He also occasionally causes emergencies himself and often gasps when an emergency comes in. Also, Station Officer Steele's name has changed to Station Officer Norris Steele.\n\nOther changes include the removal of Bella, although her caf\u00e9 can still be seen opposite Dilys' shop, now a [[7-Eleven]]-esque convenience store called the \"Cut Price Supermarket\". It seems the Whole Fish Caf\u00e9 and Bronwyn and Charlie have replaced them. Bella made her first appearance in CGI in the tenth season, where the reason behind her absence was revealed as her moving to Newtown. Penny also now has another string to her bow, as she is a trained ocean rescuer and the helmsman of Neptune (the village's lifeboat). Also, Rosa and Dusty have been replaced by Lion, Nipper, and Radar.\n\nSince 2012, additional characters were introduced: Chief Fire Officer Boyce, one animal called Norris the Guinea Pig, five new villagers named Derek Price  (originally introduced in season 6 as a minor character but then recurring since The Great Fire of Pontypandy), Moose Roberts, Gareth Griffiths, Lily, and Mrs Chen.\n\nIn 2014, other characters were introduced: a coastguard named Ben Hooper, a mechanic & inventor named Joe Sparkes with his vet wife Lizzie Sparkes, and their daughter Hannah Sparkes. Also, new vehicles were introduced: a jet ski named Juno and a fire boat named Titan. Also in the movie \"Heroes of the Storm\", there is Ellie Phillips and Arnold McKinley, new firefighter members. There is Hydrus (previously Catfish or Wildcat) the six-wheeled vehicle boat, and an unnamed Mobile Command Unit, and from 2017 onwards, Bella Lasag\u00f1e makes her CGI debut and the fire station has a new vehicle; Phoenix, the animal rescue 4X4. & Wallaby 1's replacement, is a search & rescue helicopter, Wallaby 2.\n\nThe characters in this series are voiced by [[Steven Kynman]], Andrew Hodwitz, Jonah Ain, Maraget Brock, Tegwen Tucker, Lily Cassano, Dave Pender, Jacob James, Scott Lancastle, Ashley Magwood, David Carling, Mike Pongrazc, Becky Shrimpton, Sarah Lynn Strange Carter Treneer, and Su Douglas.Joe Marth join the cast in 2010, [[John Hasler]], Ifan Huw Dafydd and [[Nigel Whitmey]] joined the cast In 2012 [[Alex Lowe]] [[Christa Clahane]] [[Adam Turgeon]] and [[Jo Wyatt]] joined the cast in 2015. [[Harriet Kershaw]], [[Ian James Corlett]], and Dave McRae, join the cast in 2016\n\nCBeebies last aired ''Fireman Sam'' on 28 December 2007, before [[Channel 5 (UK)|Channel 5]] and [[Cartoonito]] started airing it from 11 February 2008.\n\n==Episodes==\n{{main|List of Fireman Sam episodes}}\n{{:List of Fireman Sam episodes}}\n\n==Computer games== \n*''[[Alternative Software]]'' (1991) \n\n==Spin-offs==\nIn 1996, a stage production was turned into a feature, ''[[Fireman Sam In Action]]'', and released on BBC Video.\n\nIn 2009, ''Fireman Sam'' appeared with other animated children's TV characters in a ''[[Children in Need]]'' single.

However, the characters of Tom Thomas, Moose Roberts and Bella Lasagna have their regular, respective Australian, Canadian and Italian voices (instead of their being dubbed them with a US voice actor) due to their accents.

She proposed that Fireman Sam should be renamed \"Firefighter Sam\", and said that research showed that women are put off a career in the fire service because it is seen as a job for men. She also claimed that as ''Fireman Sam'' is seen by children from an early age, he reinforces this stereotype.<ref>{{cite web|title=Why We Are Campaigning To Shake Off The Outdated Term 'Firemen'|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/dany-cotton/firefighter-dany-cotton_b_18293684.html|website=HuffPost UK}}</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|2}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{BBC programme}}\n{{Wikiquote}}\n*[http://www.firemansam.com/en-gb Official Fireman Sam website]\n*{{IMDb title|id=0329829|title=Fireman Sam}}\n\n{{Portal|Wales|United Kingdom|United States|Animation|Television}}\n{{Media in Cardiff}}\n[[Category:Television characters introduced in 1987]]\n[[Category:1987 British television series debuts]]\n[[Category:1980s British children's television series]]\n[[Category:1990s British children's television series]]\n[[Category:2000s British children's television series]]\n[[Category:2003 British television series debuts]]\n[[Category:2008 British television series debuts]]\n[[Category:2010s British children's television series]]\n[[Category:1980s British animated television series]]\n[[Category:1990s British animated television series]]\n[[Category:2000s British animated television series]]\n[[Category:2010s British animated television series]]\n[[Category:British children's animated comedy television series]]\n[[Category:British children's animated drama television series]]\n[[Category:British computer-animated television series]]\n[[Category:British stop-motion animated television series]]\n[[Category:English-language television programs]]\n[[Category:Australian Broadcasting Corporation shows]]\n[[Category:BBC children's television programmes]]\n[[Category:The Den]]\n[[Category:S4C television programmes]]\n[[Category:Qubo]]\n[[Category:Fictional firefighters]]\n[[Category:Television series by DHX Media]]\n[[Category:Television series by Mattel Creations]]\n[[Category:Television series about firefighting]]\n[[Category:Television shows set in Wales]]\n", "text_old": "{{short description|Welsh animated children's television series}}\n{{Use British English|date=February 2014}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=March 2018}}\n{{Infobox television\n| show_name                = Fireman Sam\n| image                    = Fireman Sam logo.svg\n| caption                  = The logo from 2005 to 2014\n| genre                    = [[Stop motion]] (1987\u20132005)<br/>[[Computer-generated imagery|CGI]] (2008\u2013present)\n| creator                  = Rob Lee<br/>Dave Gingell<br/>Dave Jones<br/>\n| writer                   = Various\n| voices                   = [[John Alderton]]<br/>[[John Sparkes]]<br/>[[Joanna Ruiz]]<br/>[[Sarah Hadland]]<br/>[[Steven Kynman]]<br/>David Carling<br/>Su Douglas<br/>Tegwen Tucker<br/>Ifan Huw Dafydd<br/>[[Nigel Whitmey]]<br/>[[John Hasler]]<br/>[[Alex Lowe (actor)|Alex Lowe]]<br/>[[Jo Wyatt]] \n| narrated                 = [[John Alderton]] (1987\u20131994)\n| country                  = [[Wales]], United Kingdom\n| language                 = British-English, Welsh\n| num_episodes             = 200\n| list_episodes            = List of Fireman Sam episodes\n| producer                 = Various\n| runtime                  = 11 minutes (series)<br/>20 minutes (Christmas special episode)\n| company                  = [[S4C]] (1987-2005)<br>[[HIT Entertainment]] (2005-2016)<br>[[Mattel Creations|Mattel Television]] (2017-2018)<br>'''ANIMATION'''<br>[[Bumper Films]] (1987\u20131994)<br>[[Calon (TV production company)|Siriol Productions]] (2005)<br>HRTv (2008\u20132010)<br />Xing Xing Management Group (2008\u20132017)<br />[[Halifax Film|IoM Media Ventures Halifax]] (2017\u2013present)<ref>https://www.wildbrain.com/newsreleases/wildbrain-and-mattel-tv-come-to-the-rescue-with-fireman-sam-season-12/</ref>\n| distributor              = [[HIT Entertainment]] (2005\u20132016)<br>[[WildBrain]] (2017\u2013present)\n| network                  = '''Wales''' -

The original idea for the show came from two ex-firemen from [[London]], England, who took their idea to artist and writer Rob Lee who developed the concept, and the show was commissioned.\n\n''Fireman Sam'' first appeared as '''{{lang|cy|Sam T\u00e2n}}''' (''Fireman Sam'' in Welsh) on [[S4C]] in 1987, and at the same time on [[BBC One]]. The original series finished in 1994, and a new series that expanded the character cast commenced in 2005. The series was also shown in [[Scottish Gaelic|Gaelic]] in Scotland. The series was sold to over 40 countries and has been used across the UK to promote [[fire safety]].\n\n==Development==\nThe original idea came about from two ex-firemen from [[London]], England \u2013 Dave Gingell and [[David Jones (writer)|David Jones]] after [[Commission (art)|purchasing]] the [[stop motion]] animation drawn by artist Anthony Miller and [[Will Vinton]]. They approached [[Mike Young (producer)|Mike Young]], creator of ''[[SuperTed]]'', in [[Barry, Vale of Glamorgan|Barry]], Wales, and asked them to further develop their concept. The idea was then brought to S4C's Director of Animation, Chris Grace, who had previously commissioned ''SuperTed'', saw potential in the idea and commissioned the series. The characters and storylines were created by Rob Lee, an illustrator from Cardiff, and the programme was made using [[stop motion]]. It could take up to four days to produce one minute of this form of puppet animation. ''Fireman Sam'' has to this day been translated into over 25 different languages including Mandarin.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.firemansamonline.com/uk/Parents/About_Sam/index.asp | title=About Sam | accessdate=4 January 2011}}</ref>\n\nIn the original series, all the character voices were performed by [[John Alderton]]. The later series used several actors' voices.\n\n==History==\n\n===Original series (1987\u20131994)===\nThe original series comprised 32 ten-minute episodes and a 20-minute [[Christmas special]]. The narration and all the character voices were done by [[John Alderton]].  Fireman Sam is the main character of the show, and interacts with both colleagues at the [[fire station]] and fellow villagers. He is seen as somewhat of a hero in the village. Despite being so small, and with so little activity, the village sees its fair share of fires, which Sam and his team can easily handle. The vehicles at the fire station include a four-wheeled [[Bedford TK]] fire engine called Jupiter, a six-wheeled 1982 [[TACR2 (Range Rover)|Range Rover Rescue Tender]] named Venus, and Trevor's Bus, a 1985 [[Ford Transit]] Dormobile. Fireman Sam's colleagues are Elvis Cridlington, Station Officer Basil Steele (renamed Norris Steele in the new [[Computer-generated imagery|CGI]] series) and later Penny Morris (who hailed from Newtown with the firetender). The villagers are bus driver/auxiliary firefighter Trevor Evans, Italian caf\u00e9 owner Bella Lasagne, Norman Price, Norman's mother Dilys Price, and the twins Sarah and James Jones. The objects include M.O.P., Bentley the Robot, and Mechanical Master Chef.\n\nThe original series aired on [[BBC One]], [[CBBC]] and [[CBeebies]] since it was launched in 1987, most commonly airing on CBeebies on a daily basis with repeats showing until 28 December 2007. In the original series produced by [[Bumper Films]] from 1987 to 1994, the firefighters had yellow and black uniforms, whereas in the 2005 series produced by Siriol Productions and [[Gullane Entertainment]] (Later [[HIT Entertainment]]) and the 2008 [[Computer-generated imagery|CGI]] series produced by [[HIT Entertainment]] (Later [[Mattel Creations]], then Mattel Television), Xing-Xing, [[WildBrain]] and [[DHX Media]], the firefighters now have yellow and blue uniforms.\n\nIn 1988, the original series was nominated for a BAFTA Award for Best Short Animated Film. The potential recipients were Ian Frampton and John Walker.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0329829/awards | title=Awards for \"Fireman Sam\" (1987) | accessdate=4 January 2011}}</ref>\n\n===2005 series===\nIn 2005, a new ''Fireman Sam'' series was produced by [[Calon (TV production company)|Siriol Productions]] for [[HIT Entertainment]], comprising twenty-six episodes, each ten minutes in length. These episodes used more modern techniques of stop motion [[clay animation|claymation]] including mouths that move with the dialogue. This series featured all the original characters, but also introduced some new faces, such as Tom Thomas, the Australian pilot of the rescue helicopter Wallaby One and the Mountain Rescue 4\u00d74 Jeep, an unnamed photographer/news reporter, and the Flood family; consisting of Mike The Plumber, his wife Helen The Nurse, and their daughter Mandy. The updated Jupiter has six wheels, loosely based on a Bedford 6\u00d74,{{citation needed|date=July 2016}} and Venus is loosely based on a heavily modified 4x4 [[Mini|Mini Cooper]]. The characters in this series were voiced by [[John Sparkes]], Joanna Ruiz and Sarah Hadland. The series also premiered on CBeebies in 2005 and repeats were shown until 2007.\n\n===CGI series (2008\u2013present)===\nThe series was revamped in 2008 which saw the show convert to [[Computer-generated imagery|CGI]]. Pontypandy is now a seaside fishing village instead of a village set deep in the hills, though most of the locations have retained their appearances. Another change in this series is that the twins' parents appear for the first time; their new-age mother Bronwyn, and fisherman father Charlie, Sam's brother, who runs a caf\u00e9/fish-and-chip shop called the 'Whole Fish Caf\u00e9'. The series was produced by Xing-Xing from 2008-2016 and [[DHX Media]] (Later [[WildBrain]])/IoM Media Ventures Halifax for [[HIT Entertainment]] (Later [[Mattel|Mattel Creations]], then Mattel Television) from 2017\u2013present\n\nJupiter was updated again, now with a front end taken from a Volvo FL6. A yellow stripe  was added to the front of the fire engine. Minor changes were made to Venus which included a water nozzle added to the top of its roof. Trevor's bus was updated to a more modern look with angled headlights. New vehicles introduced included Mike Flood's Van in the sixth season , as well as Mercury (fire quad bike), Saturn (infrared drone), The Pontypandy Flyer (Steam Locomotive), and Bessie (Steeles first fire engine) which were introduced from the eighth season onwards.\n\nThe outfits were updated throughout the series (except for Norman Price). This included an update to the firefighter's outfits which added reflective stripes and extra badges to their tunics. Dilys Price received a large makeover which saw her getting makeup, glasses, black hair, a necklace and an updated outfit. The rest of the characters also received minor updates to their clothing.\n\nMany characters also had aspects of their personalities made more apparent. Norman Price is far more mischievous and inconsiderate than in the 2005 series where his pranks were often planned out and his accidents were due to badly planned ideas instead of outrageous schemes. For example, in the episode \"Pontypandy Extreme\", Norman gets trapped down a [[wishing well]] after attempting to climb down in order to retrieve the coins from the bottom. Other examples are Station Officer Steele's strictness and maturity and Elvis's decrease in general competence. For example, in one episode where a first aid training exercise is taking place, Elvis is told off by Steele for dancing with the dummy that is being used. At the same time, Steele is not afraid to unleash the child within him, showing an interest in kite flying and paper planes. He also occasionally causes emergencies himself and often gasps when an emergency comes in. Also, Station Officer Steele's name has changed to Station Officer Norris Steele.\n\nOther changes include the removal of Bella, although her caf\u00e9 can still be seen opposite Dilys' shop, now a [[7-Eleven]]-esque convenience store called the \"Cut Price Supermarket\". It seems the Whole Fish Caf\u00e9 and Bronwyn and Charlie have replaced them. Bella made her first appearance in CGI in the tenth season, where the reason behind her absence was revealed as her moving to Newtown. Penny also now has another string to her bow, as she is a trained ocean rescuer and the helmsman of Neptune (the village's lifeboat). Also, Rosa and Dusty have been replaced by Lion, Nipper, and Radar.\n\nSince 2012, additional characters were introduced: Chief Fire Officer Boyce, one animal called Norris the Guinea Pig, five new villagers named Derek Price  (originally introduced in season 6 as a minor character but then recurring since The Great Fire of Pontypandy), Moose Roberts, Gareth Griffiths, Lily, and Mrs Chen.\n\nIn 2014, other characters were introduced: a coastguard named Ben Hooper, a mechanic & inventor named Joe Sparkes with his vet wife Lizzie Sparkes, and their daughter Hannah Sparkes.
