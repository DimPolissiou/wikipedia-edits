The only species, ''Chinshakiangosaurus chunghoensis'', is known from a fragmentary skeleton found in [[Lower Jurassic]] rocks in [[China]]. ''Chinshakiangosaurus'' is one of the few basal sauropods with preserved skull bones and therefore important for the understanding of the early evolution of this group. It shows that early sauropods may have possessed fleshy [[cheek]]s.<ref name=\"upchurch_07\"/>\n\n== Description and feeding ==\nLike all sauropods, it was a large, quadrupedal herbivore with long neck and tail. The body length of the only specimen is estimated at 12 to 13 meters.<ref name=\"dong_92\"/> The remains consists of the [[dentary]] (the tooth bearing bone of the mandible) including teeth as well as several parts of the [[postcranium]]. By now, only the dentary and the teeth were studied extensively; the remaining skeleton still awaits a proper description.<ref name=\"upchurch_07\"/>\n\nThe dentary was curved in dorsal view, so that the mandibles formed a U-shaped, broad snout. This feature is typical for sauropods \u2013 in Prosauropods, on the contrary, the dentary was straight, forming a V-shaped, tapered snout. [[Paul Upchurch]] and colleagues (2007) suppose that this differences can give hints about feeding habits: The prosauropods with their tapered snouts possibly where selective feeders, who ate only certain plant parts, whereas sauropods with their broad snouts where bulk feeders, adapted to consume large amounts of foliage.<ref name=\"upchurch_07\"/>\n\nThe tooth size increased towards the tip of the snout, like in sauropods. Another derived, sauropod like feature was a bony plate that lined the tooth row laterally and became thicker towards the tip of the snout. This plate may have hindered the teeth to be displaced while defoliating plants.<ref name=\"upchurch_07\"/>\n\nThe dentary was deep. However, as in prosauropods, it became lower towards the tip of the snout, while in sauropods the dentary became deeper, forming a very deep [[symphysis]].<ref name=\"upchurch_07\"/><ref name=\"buffetaut_05\"/> In lateral view, the dentary shows a prominent ridge running diagonally across the bone. Apart from ''Chinshakiangosaurus'', this feature is only known from prosauropods, where it is interpreted as the insertion point of a fleshy cheek.<ref name=\"upchurch_07\"/><ref name=\"galton_04\"/> Such cheeks would have prohibited food falling out of the mouth and may be a hint that the food underwent some degree of oral processing before it was swallowed. If ''Chinshakiangosaurus'' indeed was a basal sauropod, this would be the first evidence of cheeks in this group. In all other sauropods known from congruous remains this feature had been reduced already.<ref name=\"upchurch_07\"/>\n\nOn each side of the mandible there were 19 teeth \u2013 more than in all known sauropods, but fewer than in the prosauropod ''[[Plateosaurus]]''. The teeth were lanceolate and furnished with coarse denticles; therewith they resemble those of prosauropods more than those of sauropods. However, the lingual side of the teeth already was slightly concave, possibly an initial state towards the strongly concave, spoon shaped teeth that were typical for sauropods.<ref name=\"upchurch_07\"/>\n\n== Classification ==\n{|border = \"0\" style = \"float:right;\"\n|<center>'''[[Cladistics#Cladograms|Cladogram]] of basal Sauropoda'''</center>\n|-\n|\n{{Cladogram|caption=Upchurch et al. 2007<ref name=\"upchurch_07\"/>\n|clades={{clade| style=font-size:100%;line-height:100%\n|label1=&nbsp;[[Sauropoda]]&nbsp;\n |1={{clade\n  |1=&nbsp;''[[Anchisaurus]]''\n  |label2=&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n    |2={{clade\n    |1=&nbsp;''[[Melanorosaurus]]''\n    |label2=&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n    |2={{clade\n      |1=&nbsp;''[[Antetonitrus]]''\n      |label2=&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n        |2={{clade\n        |1=&nbsp;'''''Chinshakiangosaurus'''''\n        |label2=&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n          |2={{clade\n          |1=&nbsp;''[[Isanosaurus]]''\n          |label2=&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n            |2={{clade\n            |1=&nbsp;''[[Kotasaurus]]''\n            |label2=&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n              |2={{clade\n              |1=&nbsp;''[[Vulcanodon]]''\n              |2={{clade\n                |1=&nbsp;''[[Shunosaurus]]''\n                |label2=&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n                 |2={{clade\n                 |1=&nbsp;''[[Omeisaurus]]''\n                 |2=&nbsp;'''[[Neosauropoda]]'''\n}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}\n|}\n\nInitially, Dong Zhiming classified ''Chinshakiangosaurus'' as a member of the [[Melanorosauridae]], which he thought to be a group of prosauropods. However, he already noted certain resemblances with sauropods.<ref name=\"dong_92\"/> More recent studies classify this genus as a very basal sauropod.<ref name=\"upchurch_07\"/><ref name=\"bandyopadhyay_12\"/><ref name=\"upchurch_04\"/> The exact relationships are not clear, though.<ref name=\"upchurch_07\"/>\n\n== Discovery ==\nThe fossils were found in 1970 by Zhao Xijin and colleagues in [[Yongren County]]<ref>in Upchurch et al. 2007 stated that the fossils were found in \"Yungyin County\"; however, based on the coordinates \"26.2\u00b0 North, 101.4\u00b0 East\", it can be identified as Yongren County.</ref> in central [[Yunnan]]. They come from the [[Fengjiahe Formation]], which is made up of mudstones, siltstones and sandstones that were deposited fluvolacustrine (inside rivers and lakes). Fossils of Invertebrates like ostracodes and bivalves were used to determine these sediments as Upper Jurassic in age. A more precise dating could not be made.<ref name=\"upchurch_07\"/>\n\nThe [[holotype]] specimen (IVPP V14474) consists of a left dentary, one cervical and several dorsal and caudal vertebrae, both scapulae, some pelvic bones and the hind limbs. C. H. Ye mentioned this specimen in 1975 under the name ''Chinshakiangosaurus chunghoensis'' (after the [[Yangtze River]] and the village Zhonghe). However, because he did not provide a description of the fossils, the name was a ''[[Nomen nudum]]'' (nacked name) until [[Dong Zhiming]] published a short description in 1992.<ref name=\"upchurch_07\"/><ref name=\"dong_92\"/> Since then, the authorship is correctly cited as \"''Chinshakiangosaurus chunghoensis'' Ye ''vide'' Dong, 1992\".<ref name=\"upchurch_07\"/>\n\nAfter Dongs description, this genus, though potentially valid, remained unnoticed by most paleontologists. It was mentioned by Upchurch and colleagues (2004), who classified it as a ''[[nomen dubium]]'' inside Sauropoda.<ref name=\"upchurch_04\"/> In 2007, Upchurch and colleagues published a comprehensive description of the dentary and the teeth and declared ''Chinshakiangosaurus'' as a valid taxon.<ref name=\"upchurch_07\"/>\n\n==References and Notes==\n<references>\n<ref name=\"upchurch_07\">{{Cite journal\n| volume = 144\n| issue = 2\n| pages = 247\u2013262\n| last = Upchurch\n| first = P.\n| author2 = P.

Apart from ''Chinshakiangosaurus'', this feature is only known from prosauropods, where it is interpreted as the insertion point of a fleshy cheek.<ref name=\"upchurch_07\"/><ref name=\"galton_04\"/> Such cheeks would have prohibited food falling out of the mouth and may be a hint that the food underwent some degree of oral processing before it was swallowed. If ''Chinshakiangosaurus'' indeed was a basal sauropod, this would be the first evidence of cheeks in this group. In all other sauropods known from congruous remains this feature had been reduced already.<ref name=\"upchurch_07\"/>\n\nOn each side of the mandible there were 19 teeth \u2013 more than in all known sauropods, but fewer than in the prosauropod ''[[Plateosaurus]]''. The teeth were lanceolate and furnished with coarse denticles; therewith they resemble those of prosauropods more than those of sauropods. However, the lingual side of the teeth already was slightly concave, possibly an initial state towards the strongly concave, spoon shaped teeth that were typical for sauropods.<ref name=\"upchurch_07\"/>\n\n== Classification ==\n{|border = \"0\" style = \"float:right;\"\n|<center>'''[[Cladistics#Cladograms|Cladogram]] of basal Sauropoda'''</center>\n|-\n|\n{{Cladogram|caption=Upchurch et al. 2007<ref name=\"upchurch_07\"/>\n|clades={{clade| style=font-size:100%;line-height:100%\n|label1=&nbsp;[[Sauropoda]]&nbsp;\n |1={{clade\n  |1=&nbsp;''[[Anchisaurus]]''\n  |label2=&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n    |2={{clade\n    |1=&nbsp;''[[Melanorosaurus]]''\n    |label2=&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n    |2={{clade\n      |1=&nbsp;''[[Antetonitrus]]''\n      |label2=&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n        |2={{clade\n        |1=&nbsp;'''''Chinshakiangosaurus'''''\n        |label2=&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n          |2={{clade\n          |1=&nbsp;''[[Isanosaurus]]''\n          |label2=&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n            |2={{clade\n            |1=&nbsp;''[[Kotasaurus]]''\n            |label2=&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n              |2={{clade\n              |1=&nbsp;''[[Vulcanodon]]''\n              |2={{clade\n                |1=&nbsp;''[[Shunosaurus]]''\n                |label2=&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n                 |2={{clade\n                 |1=&nbsp;''[[Omeisaurus]]''\n                 |2=&nbsp;'''[[Neosauropoda]]'''\n}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}\n|}\n\nInitially, Dong Zhiming classified ''Chinshakiangosaurus'' as a member of the [[Melanorosauridae]], which he thought to be a group of prosauropods. However, he already noted certain resemblances with sauropods.<ref name=\"dong_92\"/> More recent studies classify this genus as a very basal sauropod.<ref name=\"upchurch_07\"/><ref name=\"bandyopadhyay_12\"/><ref name=\"upchurch_04\"/> The exact relationships are not clear, though.<ref name=\"upchurch_07\"/>\n\n== Discovery ==\nThe fossils were found in 1970 by Zhao Xijin and colleagues in [[Yongren County]]<ref>in Upchurch et al. 2007 stated that the fossils were found in \"Yungyin County\"; however, based on the coordinates \"26.2\u00b0 North, 101.4\u00b0 East\", it can be identified as Yongren County.</ref> in central [[Yunnan]]. They come from the [[Fengjiahe Formation]], which is made up of mudstones, siltstones and sandstones that were deposited fluvolacustrine (inside rivers and lakes). Fossils of Invertebrates like ostracodes and bivalves were used to determine these sediments as Upper Jurassic in age. A more precise dating could not be made.<ref name=\"upchurch_07\"/>\n\nThe [[holotype]] specimen (IVPP V14474) consists of a left dentary, one cervical and several dorsal and caudal vertebrae, both scapulae, some pelvic bones and the hind limbs. C. H. Ye mentioned this specimen in 1975 under the name ''Chinshakiangosaurus chunghoensis'' (after the [[Yangtze River]] and the village Zhonghe). However, because he did not provide a description of the fossils, the name was a ''[[Nomen nudum]]'' (nacked name) until [[Dong Zhiming]] published a short description in 1992.<ref name=\"upchurch_07\"/><ref name=\"dong_92\"/> Since then, the authorship is correctly cited as \"''Chinshakiangosaurus chunghoensis'' Ye ''vide'' Dong, 1992\".<ref name=\"upchurch_07\"/>\n\nAfter Dongs description, this genus, though potentially valid, remained unnoticed by most paleontologists. It was mentioned by Upchurch and colleagues (2004), who classified it as a ''[[nomen dubium]]'' inside Sauropoda.<ref name=\"upchurch_04\"/> In 2007, Upchurch and colleagues published a comprehensive description of the dentary and the teeth and declared ''Chinshakiangosaurus'' as a valid taxon.<ref name=\"upchurch_07\"/>\n\n==References and Notes==\n<references>\n<ref name=\"upchurch_07\">{{Cite journal\n| volume = 144\n| issue = 2\n| pages = 247\u2013262\n| last = Upchurch\n| first = P.\n| author2 = P.
