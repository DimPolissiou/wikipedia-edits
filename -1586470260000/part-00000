As a producer, he has produced albums by [[Virginia Wolf]], [[Jimmy Nail]], and [[Magnum (band)|Magnum]].\n\nIn addition to his drum work, Taylor is well known for his [[falsetto]] vocal range. He sometimes played keyboards, guitars and bass on his own songs. During the 1980s, in addition to his work with Queen, he formed a parallel band known as [[The Cross (band)|the Cross]], in which he was the lead singer and rhythm guitarist. During the early 1980s, Taylor was also a panellist on the popular UK quiz show ''[[Pop Quiz]]'', hosted by [[Mike Read]]. In 2014, he appeared in ''[[The Life of Rock with Brian Pern]]'' as himself.\n\n== Early life ==\nRoger Taylor was born on 26 July 1949 at West Norfolk & Lynn Hospital in [[King's Lynn]], [[Norfolk]]. The new maternity ward was opened by Princess Elizabeth (the future queen, [[Elizabeth II]]), where she was introduced to 16 new mothers including Winifred Taylor, his mother. Taylor first lived at 87 High Street in King's Lynn, and later moved to Beulah Street in the town. Taylor's first school was Rosebury Avenue school.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Trevor|first1=Heaton|title=Rock Star's Norfolk Childhood|url=http://www.queenarchives.com/index.php?title=Roger_Taylor_-_03-20-1999_-_Eastern_Daily_Press_-_Rock_Star%27s_Norfolk_Childhood|website=Queen Archives|publisher=Eastern Daily Press}}</ref> Taylor moved to [[Truro]], [[Cornwall]], south west England, with his mother Winifred, father Michael and younger sister Clare. When he was seven years old, he and some friends formed his first band, the Bubblingover Boys, in which he played the [[ukulele]]. He briefly attended [[Truro Cathedral School]]; at the age of 13, he joined [[Truro School]] as a day boy.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://themarchoftheblackqueen.piczo.com/?g=57322673&cr=6|title=Roger|publisher=themarchoftheblackqueen.piczo.com|accessdate=8 April 2012}}</ref> At the age of 15, Taylor became a member of the Reaction, a semi-professional rock band formed mainly of boys from Truro School. Taylor had originally learned guitar, but became a drummer when he realised he had a more natural aptitude for it. Taylor taught himself to tune his drums, inspired by [[Keith Moon]] of [[the Who]] because of the \"great drums sounds\" on the early Who records.<ref name=\"Roger Taylor Interview\">{{cite web | url= http://www.queenzone.com/articles/roger-taylor-interview.aspx | title= Roger Taylor Interview | publisher= Queen Zone | accessdate= 10 August 2015 | url-status=dead | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20150715215326/http://www.queenzone.com/articles/roger-taylor-interview.aspx | archivedate= 15 July 2015 | df= dmy-all }}</ref> Another key influence on Taylor was drummer [[Mitch Mitchell]] of [[the Jimi Hendrix Experience]], who Taylor stated was his early role model.<ref name=\"Roger's Drum Master Class\">{{cite web | url= http://www.queenonline.com/en/the-band/interviews/roger-taylor-1/drum-master-class/ | title= Roger's Drum Master Class (Music Works - BBC World Service, November 28, 1993) | publisher=Queen Online | accessdate=10 August 2015}}</ref>\n\nIn 1967, Taylor went to London to study dentistry at the [[Barts and The London School of Medicine and Dentistry|London Hospital Medical College]],<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.queenonline.com/en/the-band/members/roger-taylor/|title=Roger Taylor |website=Queen official website|access-date=15 January 2017}}</ref> but he became bored with dentistry.

Smile included May on lead guitar, Staffell on lead vocals and bass, and later Taylor on drums. The band lasted for two years before Staffell departed to join [[Humpy Bong]], leaving the band with a catalogue of nine songs.\n\nSmile reunited for several songs on 22 December 1992. Taylor's band [[The Cross (band)|the Cross]] were headliners and he brought May and Staffell on to play \"Earth\" and \"If I Were a Carpenter\".<ref>[http://www.queenzone.com/queenzone/article_show.aspx?Q=11]  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070208151834/http://www.queenzone.com/queenzone/article_show.aspx?Q=11 |date=8 February 2007 }}</ref>\n\n=== 1970s\u2013present: Queen ===\n{{Main|Queen (band)}}\n[[Image:Hannover7907.jpg|thumb|right|Taylor performing with [[Queen (band)|Queen]] in 1979.]]\n\nIn 1969, Taylor was working with [[Freddie Mercury]] at the Kensington Market (they were sharing a flat at around the same time). Mercury, then known as Freddie Bulsara, was an avid fan of Smile. The band split up in 1970. In the same year, Taylor turned down the chance to become drummer for [[Genesis (band)|Genesis]], which led to [[Phil Collins]] joining instead.<ref>{{cite news | url= https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/music/8784298/Queen-40th-anniversary-10-things-you-never-knew.html | title= Queen 40th anniversary: 10 things you never knew | work=The Daily Telegraph | date=24 September 2011 | accessdate=27 August 2015}}</ref> Bulsara convinced the remaining two members of Smile to continue and he eventually joined the band, which he renamed Queen. In 1971, they recruited bass guitarist [[John Deacon]], before going on to release their [[Queen (Queen album)|self-titled debut album]] in 1973. Taylor is the third most credited songwriter for the band, usually contributing one or two tracks per album.\n\n===1977\u2013present: Solo career===\nTaylor has had a productive solo career, releasing five albums. His first single was his 1977 \"I Wanna Testify\". He recorded it during Queen's sessions for the ''[[News of the World (album)|News of the World]]'' album. The A-side, although a cover of the Parliaments song of the same name, was completely different from the original. The B-side was a self-penned song \"Turn on the TV\".\n\nTaylor's first solo album, ''[[Fun in Space]]'', was released in 1981. Taylor performed all vocals and played all instruments aside of about half of the keyboards, which were done by engineer [[David Richards (record producer)|David Richards]]. With Queen still touring heavily and recording at the time of release, Taylor was unable to promote the album to its fullest extent, so he appeared on some European TV shows to promote the single, \"Future Management\", including ''[[Top of the Pops]]''. The only other single to come from the album was \"My Country\". The only US single released from the album was \"Let's Get Crazy\".\n\nTaylor's next venture, ''[[Strange Frontier]]'', came in June 1984. The three singles from the album were the title track, \"Beautiful Dreams\" (in Portugal only) and \"Man on Fire\", the latter becoming a live favourite for him in later years. No attempts to promote the singles were made since Queen toured to promote ''[[The Works (Queen album)|The Works]]'', and Taylor did not perform on any TV shows. ''Strange Frontier'' included guest appearances by bandmates Freddie Mercury, Brian May and John Deacon. Mercury sang backing vocals on \"Killing Time\", Deacon remixed the B-side \"I Cry For You\" and [[Rick Parfitt]] co-wrote and played on \"It's An Illusion\". David Richards, Queen's engineer and producer at the time, also co-wrote two of the tracks. The album includes covers of [[Bruce Springsteen]]'s \"[[Racing in the Street]]\" and [[Bob Dylan]]'s \"[[Masters of War]]\".\n\nIn 1986, Taylor co-produced ''[[Vigilante (Magnum album)|Vigilante]]'', the sixth studio album by rock band [[Magnum (band)|Magnum]].<ref>{{cite book |author1=Patrick Lemieux | author2=Adam Unger |title=The Queen Chronology: The Recording & Release History of the Band|year=2013|page=54|publisher=Across the Board Books|isbn=978-0991984046}}</ref>\n\nAfter Queen finished their 1986 [[A Kind of Magic|Magic Tour]], Taylor started a new band, [[The Cross (band)|the Cross]], which released three albums over their six years of existence. In 1993, the band split up, after performing one final gig at the [[Wickham Festival#History|Gosport Festival]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.biography.com/people/roger-taylor-21213223|title=Roger Taylor|website=Biography|language=en-us|access-date=2018-03-01}}</ref>\n\nIn 1994, Taylor worked with [[Yoshiki (musician)|Yoshiki]], drummer and pianist of [[X Japan]] and released the song \"Foreign Sand\" and a reworking of the Cross's \"Final Destination\". The album ''Happiness?'' was \"Dedicated to the tasmanian tiger \u2013 thylacinus cynocephalus, but most especially... for Freddie\". \"Nazis 1994\" from this album became Taylor's first hit single in England and was followed by two other top 40 UK hits, \"Happiness\" and \"Foreign Sand\".\n\nIn 1998, Taylor released his fourth solo album ''[[Electric Fire]]''.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gZIjT8PgJMEC&pg=PA499&lpg=PA499&dq=In+1998,+Taylor+released+his+fourth+solo+album+Electric+Fire.&source=bl&ots=XBU0kDQe4_&sig=BBO6TCasZB87g_GSrP6vLq5xblE&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwinuvqOrMvZAhVBmBQKHZAEB34Q6AEIajAI#v=onepage&q=In%201998,%20Taylor%20released%20his%20fourth%20solo%20album%20Electric%20Fire.&f=false|title=The International Who's Who in Popular Music 2002|last=Gregory|first=Andy|date=2002|publisher=Psychology Press|isbn=9781857431612|language=en}}</ref> He supported it with a small tour in the spring of 1999, on which Brian May joined him at the gig in Wolverhampton. Taylor also performed one of the first Internet-gigs \u2013 for which he got a mention in the [[Guinness Book of World Records]].<ref>[http://www.queencollector.com/Articles/Solo10/roger.html]  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930042840/http://www.queencollector.com/Articles/Solo10/roger.html |date=30 September 2007 }}</ref>\n\nIn 2010, after nearly twelve years between solo albums, Taylor planned to release a new studio album titled ''[[The Unblinking Eye (Everything Is Broken)|The Unblinking Eye]]''. The first single, of the same name, was released on 23 November 2009 as a digital download, but due to popular demand it was released as a limited edition single.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.queenonline.com/news/1517/|title=QueenOnline \u2013 News |date=17 November 2009 |accessdate=1 December 2009}}</ref> Originally leaked to the official Queen fan club's website for members only, it still managed to be on YouTube within hours of the early bird release. It was announced in late 2012 that fans would be able to vote on which songs appeared on the new album, with the album itself slated for release that year.\n\nThe album is called ''[[Fun on Earth]]'',<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.planetrock.com/news/rock-news/roger-taylor-to-release-solo-album/ |title=Roger Taylor To Release Solo Album &#124; Rock News &#124; News |publisher=Planet Rock |date=22 November 2012 |accessdate=27 June 2013}}</ref> and was released on 11 November 2013.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/news/6296827/queen-roger-taylor-solo-record-adam-lambert|title=Queen's Roger Taylor Talks Solo Work, Hopes Band Will Record With Adam Lambert|work=Billboard|access-date=2018-03-01}}</ref>\n\n=== The Cross ===\n{{Main|The Cross (band)}}\n\nThe Cross were a side project of Taylor's that existed from 1987 to 1993 and released three albums. While still the drummer for Queen, Taylor fronted the Cross as rhythm guitarist and lead vocalist. On its debut release, ''The Cross'' incorporated dance influences which they dropped on their remaining two albums. The band never enjoyed much commercial success, except in Germany.\n\n=== ''Shove It'' ===\n[[Image:The Cross 1990 Neu Isenburg 1.jpg|thumb|Taylor performing with [[The Cross (band)|the Cross]] in 1990]]\n\nAfter Queen's 1986 Magic Tour, the band members went their separate ways to do various solo work. Taylor decided to form a new band with whom he could tour. He had already written and recorded the album himself before finding a band to play the songs with. He eventually placed an ad for band members in a national newspaper, hinting he was a famous rock musician. The position of keyboard player was duly offered to [[Spike Edney]] after two successful Queen tours in which Edney had played. When the auditions were over, the line-up was completed by Peter Noone on bass, Clayton Moss on guitar and [[Josh Macrae]] on drums. Taylor himself would take the responsibility on lead vocals and rhythm guitar.\n\nThe first album, ''Shove It'', was released in 1988.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.discogs.com/Cross-Shove-It/release/6351445|title=The Cross (3) - Shove It|website=Discogs|language=en|access-date=2018-03-01}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.allmusic.com/album/shove-it-mw0000651910|title=Shove It - Cross {{!}} Songs, Reviews, Credits {{!}} AllMusic|website=AllMusic|access-date=2018-03-01}}</ref> In Europe, '[[Heaven for Everyone]]\" (later a Queen song) contained Freddie Mercury on lead vocals and Taylor on backing vocals. However, on the single version and American album version the roles were switched. The European CD contained an extra track (compared to cassette and LP) in the 2nd Shelf Mix, the US version having \"Feel the Force\" as its extra track. The band promoted hard (especially in Germany), with many TV performances of singles including an appearance at the Montreux Golden Rose festival in 1988. The tour took in dates in the UK and Germany. Three singles were released from the album: \"Cowboys and Indians\", \"Heaven for Everyone\" and \"Shove It\". Another single, \"Manipulator\", was released in 1988, but it was not included on any album. It was also the only song from the time that had joint writing credits, Taylor sharing them with Edney and Steve Strange.\n\n=== ''Mad, Bad and Dangerous to Know'' ===\n[[Image:The Cross 1990 Neu Isenburg 2.jpg|thumb|Taylor performing with the Cross in 1990.]]\n\nAfter finishing Queen's 1989 album ''[[The Miracle (album)|The Miracle]]'', Taylor went into the studio with the rest of the Cross for the first time to record ''[[Mad, Bad and Dangerous to Know (The Cross album)|Mad, Bad and Dangerous to Know]]''. The band composed the opening track \"On Top of the World Ma\" with a riff bearing a resemblance to the [[Led Zeppelin]] track \"[[Whole Lotta Love]]\". The rest of the album consisted mainly of individually written songs, except for \"Power To Love\" which was the result of the combined effort of Macrae, Noone and Moss. Clayton Moss sang lead vocals on his own track \"Better Things\", and Spike Edney played [[mandolin]] on \"Final Destination\", which was written by Taylor. \"Final Destination\" was released as a single, as were \"Liar\" and \"Power To Love\", the latter being the last single to be released in the UK by the band. \"Final Destination\" came with a live rendition of Taylor's song \"Man on Fire\" as a B-side, and \"Liar\" (Noone) had a brand new track, \"In Charge of My Heart\", which was also penned by Taylor. The 12\" single and CD of \"Liar\" also included extended remixes of both \"Liar\" and \"In Charge of My Heart\". The instrumental section at the beginning of \"In Charge of My Heart\" was used as the opening to concerts on the accompanying tour. \"Closer To You\" (Edney) had been planned to be released in America, but never was. The group having seemingly given up on the UK market, the accompanying tour only included dates in Germany, Austria, Switzerland and Ibiza. Unusual for such tours, every song from the new album was played live.\n\n=== ''Blue Rock'' ===\nMade at a time when Taylor's efforts were concentrated on Queen and Mercury himself, ''[[Blue Rock (album)|Blue Rock]]'' gave the other members of the band a chance to take control of the upcoming album. It was in fact mostly written by Edney, who contributed three of his own tracks and contributed to four more. Once again the opening track was penned by the entire band, \"Bad Attitude\" was written (although not complete) by the Christmas fan club party of 1990. The album itself contained a lot of vocals not from Taylor, but mainly of Edney and Noone. Examples of this can be heard in \"Put It All Down To Love\" (Edney), \"Life Changes\" (Moss, Noone, Edney and Macrae) and \"Heartland\" (The B-side to Life Changes, penned by Noone). Blue Rock itself was only released in Germany (although promo copies were released in Italy and Japan), so copies are somewhat rare. \"New Dark Ages\" (Taylor) was released in Germany with another live version of \"Man on Fire\", whilst \"Life Changes\" was released with the B-side \"Heartland\". It was however immediately withdrawn due to Mercury's death. The tour was in support of [[Magnum (band)|Magnum]], so the concert lengths were short (45 mins.) and very few bootlegs have survived. The tour pace was rapid, covering 20 dates in one month.\n\n=== Break-up of the Cross ===\nThe band broke up in 1993 after performing a final show. Taylor continued working with Queen and produced solo albums. Drummer Macrae accompanied Taylor on his solo tours and also played percussion at the Freddie Mercury Tribute Concert. Both Taylor and keyboardist Edney participated in the [[Queen + Paul Rodgers]] tours, while Macrae worked behind the scenes as co-producer, sound engineer and Pro Tools engineer for them. In the late 1990s, Edney formed the SAS Band (\"Spike's All Stars\"), a group with an ever-changing line-up of popular '80s musicians.\n\n=== 21st century ===\nTaylor has appeared along with May for various other events and promotions, including Queen's induction into the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]] in 2001<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rockhall.com/inductees/queen |title=Queen: inducted in 2001 &#124; The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and Museum |publisher=Rockhall.com |date=15 April 2013 |accessdate=16 July 2014}}</ref> and the \"[[Party at the Palace]]\" in 2002, celebrating the golden jubilee of [[Queen Elizabeth II]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.queenvault.com/patp.html |title=Party at the Palace |publisher=QueenVault.com |date=3 June 2002 |accessdate=16 July 2014}}</ref> In 2004, Taylor, May, and Mike Dixon received the [[Helpmann Award]] for Best Music Direction for the musical [[We Will Rock You (musical)|''We Will Rock You'']].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.helpmannawards.com.au/2004/past-nominees-and-winners/industry-awards|title=Past nominees and winners Helpmann Awards|accessdate=16 December 2016}}</ref>  At [[Live Earth]] in 2007, Taylor opened the concert with [[Taylor Hawkins]] of [[Foo Fighters]] and [[Chad Smith]] of [[Red Hot Chili Peppers]].\n\nTaylor and May, performing as Queen, also appeared three times on the American singing contest television show ''[[American Idol]]''. The first appearance was on 11 April 2006, during which that week's contestants were required to sing a Queen song. Songs performed included \"[[Bohemian Rhapsody]]\", \"[[Fat Bottomed Girls]]\", \"[[The Show Must Go On (Queen song)|The Show Must Go On]]\", \"[[Who Wants to Live Forever]]\", and \"[[Innuendo (song)|Innuendo]]\". The second time Queen appeared was on the show's [[American Idol (season 8)|season 8]] finale in May 2009, performing \"We Are the Champions\" with finalists [[Adam Lambert]] and [[Kris Allen]]. The third appearance was during the [[American Idol (season 11)|eleventh season]] on 25 and 26 April 2012, performing a Queen medley with the six finalists on the first show.

He said: \"I still think listening to Mitch Mitchell, especially the early stuff with Hendrix, is just fantastic. This fusion of jazz technique and wonderful riffs but with this rolling ferocious attack on the whole kit, it had lots of jazz influences I think. In fact for me he played the kit like a song, it was just wonderful. Total integration into the song. Not just marking time\".<ref name=\"Roger's Drum Master Class\"/>\n\nTaylor has also expressed great admiration for [[John Bonham]] of [[Led Zeppelin]]. Speaking of Bonham, Taylor said, \"The greatest rock and roll drummer of all time was John Bonham, who did things that nobody had ever even thought possible before with the drum kit. And also the greatest sound out of his drums \u2013 they sounded enormous, and just one bass drum. So fast on it that he did more with one bass drum than most people could do with three, if they could manage them. And he had technique to burn and fantastic power and tremendous feel for rock and roll\".<ref name=\"Roger's Drum Master Class\"/> However, for just sheer technique, Taylor described the jazz and [[big band]] drummer [[Buddy Rich]] as \"the best I've ever seen\".<ref name=\"Roger's Drum Master Class\"/>\n\nSpeaking to ''[[Modern Drummer]]'' in 1984, Taylor also described [[Keith Moon]], the drummer of [[the Who]], as \"absolutely brilliant...he had a total unique style; he didn't owe anyone anything.\"<ref name=\"Roger Taylor Interview\"/>\n\n== Tributes ==\nIn 2013, a newly-discovered species of the genus ''[[Heteragrion]]'' (Odonata: Zygoptera) from Brazil was named ''Heteragrion rogertaylori'' after Taylor, in honour of his \"powerful sound, wonderful lyrics and raspy voice \"{{spaced ndash}}one of four ''Heteragrion'' flatwing [[Damselfly|damselflies]] named after the bandmates, paying tribute to the 40th anniversary of Queen's founding.<ref>{{Cite web|url = http://www.mapress.com/zootaxa/2013/f/z03685p080f.pdf|title = Diagnoses and discussion of the group 1 and 2 Brazilian species of Heteragrion, with descriptions of four new species (Odonata: Megapodagrionidae).

As a producer, he has produced albums by [[Virginia Wolf]], [[Jimmy Nail]], and [[Magnum (band)|Magnum]].\n\nIn addition to his drum work, Taylor is well known for his [[falsetto]] vocal range. He sometimes played keyboards, guitars and bass on his own songs. During the 1980s, in addition to his work with Queen, he formed a parallel band known as [[The Cross (band)|the Cross]], in which he was the lead singer and rhythm guitarist. During the early 1980s, Taylor was also a panellist on the popular UK quiz show ''[[Pop Quiz]]'', hosted by [[Mike Read]]. In 2014, he appeared in ''[[The Life of Rock with Brian Pern]]'' as himself.\n\n== Early life ==\nRoger Taylor was born on 26 July 1949 at West Norfolk & Lynn Hospital in [[King's Lynn]], [[Norfolk]]. The new maternity ward was opened by Princess Elizabeth (the future queen, [[Elizabeth II]]), where she was introduced to 16 new mothers including Winifred Taylor, his mother. Taylor first lived at 87 High Street in King's Lynn, and later moved to Beulah Street in the town. Taylor's first school was Rosebury Avenue school.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Trevor|first1=Heaton|title=Rock Star's Norfolk Childhood|url=http://www.queenarchives.com/index.php?title=Roger_Taylor_-_03-20-1999_-_Eastern_Daily_Press_-_Rock_Star%27s_Norfolk_Childhood|website=Queen Archives|publisher=Eastern Daily Press}}</ref> Taylor moved to [[Truro]], [[Cornwall]], south west England, with his mother Winifred, father Michael and younger sister Clare. When he was seven years old, he and some friends formed his first band, the Bubblingover Boys, in which he played the [[ukulele]]. He briefly attended [[Truro Cathedral School]]; at the age of 13, he joined [[Truro School]] as a day boy.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://themarchoftheblackqueen.piczo.com/?g=57322673&cr=6|title=Roger|publisher=themarchoftheblackqueen.piczo.com|accessdate=8 April 2012}}</ref> At the age of 15, Taylor became a member of the Reaction, a semi-professional rock band formed mainly of boys from Truro School. Taylor had originally learned guitar, but became a drummer when he realised he had a more natural aptitude for it. Taylor taught himself to tune his drums, inspired by [[Keith Moon]] of [[the Who]] because of the \"great drums sounds\" on the early Who records.<ref name=\"Roger Taylor Interview\">{{cite web | url= http://www.queenzone.com/articles/roger-taylor-interview.aspx | title= Roger Taylor Interview | publisher= Queen Zone | accessdate= 10 August 2015 | url-status=dead | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20150715215326/http://www.queenzone.com/articles/roger-taylor-interview.aspx | archivedate= 15 July 2015 | df= dmy-all }}</ref> Another key influence on Taylor was drummer [[Mitch Mitchell]] of [[the Jimi Hendrix Experience]], who Taylor stated was his early role model.<ref name=\"Roger's Drum Master Class\">{{cite web | url= http://www.queenonline.com/en/the-band/interviews/roger-taylor-1/drum-master-class/ | title= Roger's Drum Master Class (Music Works - BBC World Service, November 28, 1993) | publisher=Queen Online | accessdate=10 August 2015}}</ref>\n\nIn 1967, Taylor went to London to study dentistry at the [[Barts and The London School of Medicine and Dentistry|London Hospital Medical College]],<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.queenonline.com/en/the-band/members/roger-taylor/|title=Roger Taylor |website=Queen official website|access-date=15 January 2017}}</ref> but he became bored with dentistry.

Smile included May on lead guitar, Staffell on lead vocals and bass, and later Taylor on drums. The band lasted for two years before Staffell departed to join [[Humpy Bong]], leaving the band with a catalogue of nine songs.\n\nSmile reunited for several songs on 22 December 1992. Taylor's band [[The Cross (band)|the Cross]] were headliners and he brought May and Staffell on to play \"Earth\" and \"If I Were a Carpenter\".<ref>[http://www.queenzone.com/queenzone/article_show.aspx?Q=11]  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070208151834/http://www.queenzone.com/queenzone/article_show.aspx?Q=11 |date=8 February 2007 }}</ref>\n\n=== 1970s\u2013present: Queen ===\n{{Main|Queen (band)}}\n[[Image:Hannover7907.jpg|thumb|right|Taylor performing with [[Queen (band)|Queen]] in 1979.]]\n\nIn 1969, Taylor was working with [[Freddie Mercury]] at the Kensington Market (they were sharing a flat at around the same time). Mercury, then known as Freddie Bulsara, was an avid fan of Smile. The band split up in 1970. In the same year, Taylor turned down the chance to become drummer for [[Genesis (band)|Genesis]], which led to [[Phil Collins]] joining instead.<ref>{{cite news | url= https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/music/8784298/Queen-40th-anniversary-10-things-you-never-knew.html | title= Queen 40th anniversary: 10 things you never knew | work=The Daily Telegraph | date=24 September 2011 | accessdate=27 August 2015}}</ref> Bulsara convinced the remaining two members of Smile to continue and he eventually joined the band, which he renamed Queen. In 1971, they recruited bass guitarist [[John Deacon]], before going on to release their [[Queen (Queen album)|self-titled debut album]] in 1973. Taylor is the third most credited songwriter for the band, usually contributing one or two tracks per album.\n\n===1977\u2013present: Solo career===\nTaylor has had a productive solo career, releasing five albums. His first single was his 1977 \"I Wanna Testify\". He recorded it during Queen's sessions for the ''[[News of the World (album)|News of the World]]'' album. The A-side, although a cover of the Parliaments song of the same name, was completely different from the original. The B-side was a self-penned song \"Turn on the TV\".\n\nTaylor's first solo album, ''[[Fun in Space]]'', was released in 1981. Taylor performed all vocals and played all instruments aside of about half of the keyboards, which were done by engineer [[David Richards (record producer)|David Richards]]. With Queen still touring heavily and recording at the time of release, Taylor was unable to promote the album to its fullest extent, so he appeared on some European TV shows to promote the single, \"Future Management\", including ''[[Top of the Pops]]''. The only other single to come from the album was \"My Country\". The only US single released from the album was \"Let's Get Crazy\".\n\nTaylor's next venture, ''[[Strange Frontier]]'', came in June 1984. The three singles from the album were the title track, \"Beautiful Dreams\" (in Portugal only) and \"Man on Fire\", the latter becoming a live favourite for him in later years. No attempts to promote the singles were made since Queen toured to promote ''[[The Works (Queen album)|The Works]]'', and Taylor did not perform on any TV shows. ''Strange Frontier'' included guest appearances by bandmates Freddie Mercury, Brian May and John Deacon. Mercury sang backing vocals on \"Killing Time\", Deacon remixed the B-side \"I Cry For You\" and [[Rick Parfitt]] co-wrote and played on \"It's An Illusion\". David Richards, Queen's engineer and producer at the time, also co-wrote two of the tracks. The album includes covers of [[Bruce Springsteen]]'s \"[[Racing in the Street]]\" and [[Bob Dylan]]'s \"[[Masters of War]]\".\n\nIn 1986, Taylor co-produced ''[[Vigilante (Magnum album)|Vigilante]]'', the sixth studio album by rock band [[Magnum (band)|Magnum]].<ref>{{cite book |author1=Patrick Lemieux | author2=Adam Unger |title=The Queen Chronology: The Recording & Release History of the Band|year=2013|page=54|publisher=Across the Board Books|isbn=978-0991984046}}</ref>\n\nAfter Queen finished their 1986 [[A Kind of Magic|Magic Tour]], Taylor started a new band, [[The Cross (band)|the Cross]], which released three albums over their six years of existence. In 1993, the band split up, after performing one final gig at the [[Wickham Festival#History|Gosport Festival]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.biography.com/people/roger-taylor-21213223|title=Roger Taylor|website=Biography|language=en-us|access-date=2018-03-01}}</ref>\n\nIn 1994, Taylor worked with [[Yoshiki (musician)|Yoshiki]], drummer and pianist of [[X Japan]] and released the song \"Foreign Sand\" and a reworking of the Cross's \"Final Destination\". The album ''Happiness?'' was \"Dedicated to the tasmanian tiger \u2013 thylacinus cynocephalus, but most especially... for Freddie\". \"Nazis 1994\" from this album became Taylor's first hit single in England and was followed by two other top 40 UK hits, \"Happiness\" and \"Foreign Sand\".\n\nIn 1998, Taylor released his fourth solo album ''[[Electric Fire]]''.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gZIjT8PgJMEC&pg=PA499&lpg=PA499&dq=In+1998,+Taylor+released+his+fourth+solo+album+Electric+Fire.&source=bl&ots=XBU0kDQe4_&sig=BBO6TCasZB87g_GSrP6vLq5xblE&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwinuvqOrMvZAhVBmBQKHZAEB34Q6AEIajAI#v=onepage&q=In%201998,%20Taylor%20released%20his%20fourth%20solo%20album%20Electric%20Fire.&f=false|title=The International Who's Who in Popular Music 2002|last=Gregory|first=Andy|date=2002|publisher=Psychology Press|isbn=9781857431612|language=en}}</ref> He supported it with a small tour in the spring of 1999, on which Brian May joined him at the gig in Wolverhampton. Taylor also performed one of the first Internet-gigs \u2013 for which he got a mention in the [[Guinness Book of World Records]].<ref>[http://www.queencollector.com/Articles/Solo10/roger.html]  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930042840/http://www.queencollector.com/Articles/Solo10/roger.html |date=30 September 2007 }}</ref>\n\nIn 2010, after nearly twelve years between solo albums, Taylor planned to release a new studio album titled ''[[The Unblinking Eye (Everything Is Broken)|The Unblinking Eye]]''. The first single, of the same name, was released on 23 November 2009 as a digital download, but due to popular demand it was released as a limited edition single.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.queenonline.com/news/1517/|title=QueenOnline \u2013 News |date=17 November 2009 |accessdate=1 December 2009}}</ref> Originally leaked to the official Queen fan club's website for members only, it still managed to be on YouTube within hours of the early bird release.

While still the drummer for Queen, Taylor fronted the Cross as rhythm guitarist and lead vocalist. On its debut release, ''The Cross'' incorporated dance influences which they dropped on their remaining two albums. The band never enjoyed much commercial success, except in Germany.\n\n=== ''Shove It'' ===\n[[Image:The Cross 1990 Neu Isenburg 1.jpg|thumb|Taylor performing with [[The Cross (band)|the Cross]] in 1990]]\n\nAfter Queen's 1986 Magic Tour, the band members went their separate ways to do various solo work. Taylor decided to form a new band with whom he could tour. He had already written and recorded the album himself before finding a band to play the songs with. He eventually placed an ad for band members in a national newspaper, hinting he was a famous rock musician. The position of keyboard player was duly offered to [[Spike Edney]] after two successful Queen tours in which Edney had played. When the auditions were over, the line-up was completed by Peter Noone on bass, Clayton Moss on guitar and [[Josh Macrae]] on drums. Taylor himself would take the responsibility on lead vocals and rhythm guitar.\n\nThe first album, ''Shove It'', was released in 1988.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.discogs.com/Cross-Shove-It/release/6351445|title=The Cross (3) - Shove It|website=Discogs|language=en|access-date=2018-03-01}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.allmusic.com/album/shove-it-mw0000651910|title=Shove It - Cross {{!}} Songs, Reviews, Credits {{!}} AllMusic|website=AllMusic|access-date=2018-03-01}}</ref> In Europe, '[[Heaven for Everyone]]\" (later a Queen song) contained Freddie Mercury on lead vocals and Taylor on backing vocals. However, on the single version and American album version the roles were switched. The European CD contained an extra track (compared to cassette and LP) in the 2nd Shelf Mix, the US version having \"Feel the Force\" as its extra track. The band promoted hard (especially in Germany), with many TV performances of singles including an appearance at the Montreux Golden Rose festival in 1988. The tour took in dates in the UK and Germany. Three singles were released from the album: \"Cowboys and Indians\", \"Heaven for Everyone\" and \"Shove It\". Another single, \"Manipulator\", was released in 1988, but it was not included on any album. It was also the only song from the time that had joint writing credits, Taylor sharing them with Edney and Steve Strange.\n\n=== ''Mad, Bad and Dangerous to Know'' ===\n[[Image:The Cross 1990 Neu Isenburg 2.jpg|thumb|Taylor performing with the Cross in 1990.]]\n\nAfter finishing Queen's 1989 album ''[[The Miracle (album)|The Miracle]]'', Taylor went into the studio with the rest of the Cross for the first time to record ''[[Mad, Bad and Dangerous to Know (The Cross album)|Mad, Bad and Dangerous to Know]]''. The band composed the opening track \"On Top of the World Ma\" with a riff bearing a resemblance to the [[Led Zeppelin]] track \"[[Whole Lotta Love]]\". The rest of the album consisted mainly of individually written songs, except for \"Power To Love\" which was the result of the combined effort of Macrae, Noone and Moss. Clayton Moss sang lead vocals on his own track \"Better Things\", and Spike Edney played [[mandolin]] on \"Final Destination\", which was written by Taylor. \"Final Destination\" was released as a single, as were \"Liar\" and \"Power To Love\", the latter being the last single to be released in the UK by the band. \"Final Destination\" came with a live rendition of Taylor's song \"Man on Fire\" as a B-side, and \"Liar\" (Noone) had a brand new track, \"In Charge of My Heart\", which was also penned by Taylor. The 12\" single and CD of \"Liar\" also included extended remixes of both \"Liar\" and \"In Charge of My Heart\". The instrumental section at the beginning of \"In Charge of My Heart\" was used as the opening to concerts on the accompanying tour. \"Closer To You\" (Edney) had been planned to be released in America, but never was. The group having seemingly given up on the UK market, the accompanying tour only included dates in Germany, Austria, Switzerland and Ibiza. Unusual for such tours, every song from the new album was played live.\n\n=== ''Blue Rock'' ===\nMade at a time when Taylor's efforts were concentrated on Queen and Mercury himself, ''[[Blue Rock (album)|Blue Rock]]'' gave the other members of the band a chance to take control of the upcoming album. It was in fact mostly written by Edney, who contributed three of his own tracks and contributed to four more. Once again the opening track was penned by the entire band, \"Bad Attitude\" was written (although not complete) by the Christmas fan club party of 1990. The album itself contained a lot of vocals not from Taylor, but mainly of Edney and Noone. Examples of this can be heard in \"Put It All Down To Love\" (Edney), \"Life Changes\" (Moss, Noone, Edney and Macrae) and \"Heartland\" (The B-side to Life Changes, penned by Noone). Blue Rock itself was only released in Germany (although promo copies were released in Italy and Japan), so copies are somewhat rare. \"New Dark Ages\" (Taylor) was released in Germany with another live version of \"Man on Fire\", whilst \"Life Changes\" was released with the B-side \"Heartland\". It was however immediately withdrawn due to Mercury's death. The tour was in support of [[Magnum (band)|Magnum]], so the concert lengths were short (45 mins.) and very few bootlegs have survived. The tour pace was rapid, covering 20 dates in one month.\n\n=== Break-up of the Cross ===\nThe band broke up in 1993 after performing a final show. Taylor continued working with Queen and produced solo albums. Drummer Macrae accompanied Taylor on his solo tours and also played percussion at the Freddie Mercury Tribute Concert. Both Taylor and keyboardist Edney participated in the [[Queen + Paul Rodgers]] tours, while Macrae worked behind the scenes as co-producer, sound engineer and Pro Tools engineer for them. In the late 1990s, Edney formed the SAS Band (\"Spike's All Stars\"), a group with an ever-changing line-up of popular '80s musicians.\n\n=== 21st century ===\nTaylor has appeared along with May for various other events and promotions, including Queen's induction into the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]] in 2001<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rockhall.com/inductees/queen |title=Queen: inducted in 2001 &#124; The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and Museum |publisher=Rockhall.com |date=15 April 2013 |accessdate=16 July 2014}}</ref> and the \"[[Party at the Palace]]\" in 2002, celebrating the golden jubilee of [[Queen Elizabeth II]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.queenvault.com/patp.html |title=Party at the Palace |publisher=QueenVault.com |date=3 June 2002 |accessdate=16 July 2014}}</ref> In 2004, Taylor, May, and Mike Dixon received the [[Helpmann Award]] for Best Music Direction for the musical [[We Will Rock You (musical)|''We Will Rock You'']].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.helpmannawards.com.au/2004/past-nominees-and-winners/industry-awards|title=Past nominees and winners Helpmann Awards|accessdate=16 December 2016}}</ref>  At [[Live Earth]] in 2007, Taylor opened the concert with [[Taylor Hawkins]] of [[Foo Fighters]] and [[Chad Smith]] of [[Red Hot Chili Peppers]].\n\nTaylor and May, performing as Queen, also appeared three times on the American singing contest television show ''[[American Idol]]''.

He said: \"I still think listening to Mitch Mitchell, especially the early stuff with Hendrix, is just fantastic. This fusion of jazz technique and wonderful riffs but with this rolling ferocious attack on the whole kit, it had lots of jazz influences I think. In fact for me he played the kit like a song, it was just wonderful. Total integration into the song. Not just marking time\".<ref name=\"Roger's Drum Master Class\"/>\n\nTaylor has also expressed great admiration for [[John Bonham]] of [[Led Zeppelin]]. Speaking of Bonham, Taylor said, \"The greatest rock and roll drummer of all time was John Bonham, who did things that nobody had ever even thought possible before with the drum kit. And also the greatest sound out of his drums \u2013 they sounded enormous, and just one bass drum. So fast on it that he did more with one bass drum than most people could do with three, if they could manage them. And he had technique to burn and fantastic power and tremendous feel for rock and roll\".<ref name=\"Roger's Drum Master Class\"/> However, for just sheer technique, Taylor described the jazz and [[big band]] drummer [[Buddy Rich]] as \"the best I've ever seen\".<ref name=\"Roger's Drum Master Class\"/>\n\nSpeaking to ''[[Modern Drummer]]'' in 1984, Taylor also described [[Keith Moon]], the drummer of [[the Who]], as \"absolutely brilliant...he had a total unique style; he didn't owe anyone anything.\"<ref name=\"Roger Taylor Interview\"/>\n\n== Tributes ==\nIn 2013, a newly-discovered species of the genus ''[[Heteragrion]]'' (Odonata : Zygoptera) from Brazil was named ''Heteragrion rogertaylori'' after Taylor, in honour of his \"powerful sound, wonderful lyrics and raspy voice \"{{spaced ndash}}one of four ''Heteragrion'' flatwing [[Damselfly|damselflies]] named after the bandmates, paying tribute to the 40th anniversary of Queen's founding.<ref>{{Cite web|url = http://www.mapress.com/zootaxa/2013/f/z03685p080f.pdf|title = Diagnoses and discussion of the group 1 and 2 Brazilian species of Heteragrion, with descriptions of four new species (Odonata: Megapodagrionidae).

From the moment of formation, Airbus had begun studies into derivatives of the Airbus A300B in support of this long-term goal.<ref>{{harvnb|Wensveen|2007|page=63}}</ref> Prior to the service introduction of the first Airbus airliners, Airbus had identified nine possible variations of the A300 known as A300B1 to B9.<ref name=\"gunston2009\">{{harvnb|Gunston|2009}}</ref> A tenth variation, conceived in 1973, later the first to be constructed, was designated the A300B10.<ref name=\"N&W p.18\">{{harvnb|Norris|Wagner|2001|p=18}}</ref> It was a smaller aircraft that would be developed into the long-range [[Airbus A310]]. Airbus then focused its efforts on the single-aisle market, which resulted in the [[Airbus A320 family]], which was the first digital [[fly-by-wire]] commercial aircraft. The decision to work on the A320, instead of a four-engine aircraft proposed by the Germans, created divisions within Airbus.<ref name=\"N&W p.18\"/> As the SA or \"single aisle\" studies (which later became the successful Airbus A320) underwent development to challenge the successful [[Boeing 737]] and [[Douglas DC-9]] in the single-aisle, [[Narrow-body aircraft|narrow-body airliner]] market, Airbus turned its focus back to the [[wide-body aircraft]] market.\n\nThe A300B11,<ref name=\"Eden p.30\"/> a derivative of the A310, was designed upon the availability of \"ten ton\" thrust engines.<ref name=\"N&W p.23\">{{harvnb|Norris|Wagner|2001|p=23}}</ref> Using four engines, it would seat between 180 and 200 passengers, and have a range of {{Convert|6000|nmi|km}|order=flip}}.<ref>{{harvnb|Norris|Wagner|1999|p=59}}</ref> It was deemed a replacement for the less-efficient [[Boeing 707]]s and [[Douglas DC-8]]s still in service.<ref name=\"N&W p.23\"/> The A300B11 was joined by another design, the A300B9, which was a larger derivative of the A300. The B9 was developed by Airbus from the early 1970s at a slow pace until the early 1980s. It was essentially a stretched A300 with the same wing, coupled with the most powerful [[turbofan engine]] available at the time.<ref name=\"N&W p.23\"/> It was targeted at the growing demand for high-capacity, medium-range, transcontinental trunk routes.<ref name=\"N&W p.23\"/> The B9 offered the same [[Range (aircraft)|range]] and payload as the [[McDonnell Douglas DC-10]], but it used between 25%<ref name=\"N&W p.23\"/> to 38%<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/06/11/business/11air.html?_r=1|title=To Save Fuel, Airlines Find No Speck Too Small|work=The New York Times|last=Maynard|first=Micheline|date=11 June 2008}}</ref> less fuel.

Airbus vice president for strategic planning, Adam Brown, recalled,\n<blockquote>North American operators were clearly in favour of a twin[jet], while Asians wanted a quad[jet]. In Europe, opinion was split between the two. The majority of potential customers were in favour of a quad despite the fact, in certain conditions, it is more costly to operate than a twin. They liked that it could be ferried with one engine out, and could fly 'anywhere'\u2014 ETOPS (extend-range twin-engine operations) hadn't begun then.<ref>{{Cite journal|title=Airbus A330/A340|journal=Flight International|url=http://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1997/1997%20-%202917.html|accessdate=26 January 2011|last=Kingsley-Jones|first=Max|date=4 November 1997}}</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Norris|Wagner|2001|pp=22\u201323}}</ref></blockquote>\n\n===Design effort===\nThe first specifications of the TA9 and TA11 were released in 1982.<ref name=\"N&W p.24\">{{harvnb|Norris|Wagner|1999|p=24}}</ref> While the TA9 had a range of {{convert|3300|nmi|km|order=flip}}, the TA11 range was up to {{Convert|6830|nmi|km}|order=flip}.<ref name=\"N&W p.24\"/> At the same time, Airbus also sketched the TA12, a twin-engine derivative of the TA11, which was optimised for flights of a {{Convert|2000|nmi|km}|order=flip} lesser range.<ref name=\"N&W p.24\"/> By the time of the [[Paris Air Show]] in June 1985, more refinements had been made to the TA9 and TA11, including the adoption of the A320 [[Cockpit|flight deck]], [[fly-by-wire]] (FBW) [[Aircraft flight control system|flight control system]] and [[side-stick]] control.<ref name=\"N&W p.27\">{{harvnb|Norris|Wagner|2001|p=27}}</ref> Adopting a common cockpit across the new Airbus series allowed operators to make significant cost savings; flight crews would be able to transition from one to another after one week of training.<ref name=\"Lawrence p.73\">{{harvnb|Lawrence|Thornton|2005|p=73}}</ref> The TA11 and TA12 would use the front and rear fuselage sections of the A310.<ref>{{harvnb|Norris|Wagner|2001|p=24}}</ref> Components were modular and also interchangeable with other Airbus aircraft where possible<ref name=\"Lawrence p.73\"/> to reduce production, maintenance and operating costs.\n\n[[File:A340-642 flight deck.jpg|thumb|The A330/A340 shares a common flight deck with the A320.]]\nAirbus briefly considered a [[variable camber wing]]; the concept was that the wing could change its profile to produce the optimum shape for a given phase of flight. Studies were carried out by [[British Aerospace]] (BAe) at [[Hatfield, Hertfordshire|Hatfield]] and [[Bristol]]. Airbus estimated this would yield a 2% improvement in aerodynamic efficiency.<ref>{{harvnb|Norris|Wagner|2001|p=26}}</ref> However, the plan was later abandoned on grounds of cost and difficulty of development.<ref name=\"Eden p.30\"/>\n\nAirbus had held discussions with [[McDonnell Douglas]] to jointly produce the aircraft, which would have been designated as the ''AM 300''.<ref name=\"N&W p.28\">{{harvnb|Norris|Wagner|2001|p=28}}</ref> This aeroplane would have combined the wing of the A330 with the fuselage of the [[McDonnell Douglas MD-11]].<ref name=\"N&W p.28\"/> However, talks were terminated as McDonnell Douglas insisted on the continuation of its [[trijet]] heritage.<ref name=\"auto\">{{harvnb|Norris|Wagner|1999|p=67}}</ref> Although from the start it was intended that the A340 would be powered by four [[CFM56]]-5 [[turbofan engine]]s, each capable of {{Convert|25000|lbf|kN}},<ref>{{harvnb|Gunston|2009|p=201}}</ref> Airbus had also considered developing the aircraft as a trijet due to the limited power of engines available at the time, namely the [[Rolls-Royce RB211]]-535 and [[Pratt & Whitney JT10D]]-232<ref>{{harnvb|Norris|Wagner|2001|p=36}}</ref> (redesignated PW2000 in December 1980).\n\nAs refinements in the A340's design proceeded, a radical new engine option was offered by International Aero Engines, a group comprising Rolls-Royce, [[Pratt & Whitney]], [[Japanese Aero Engines Corporation]], [[Fiat]] and [[MTU Aero Engines]] (MTU). The [[Nacelle|engine nacelles]] of the superfan engine consisted of provisions to allow a large fan near the rear of the engine. As a result of the superfan cancellation by IAE, the [[CFM56]]-5C4 was used as the sole engine choice instead of there being an alternate option as originally envisioned. The longer-range versions, namely the A340-500 and -600, are powered by [[Rolls-Royce Trent 500]] engines.\n\nOn 27 January 1986, the Airbus Industrie Supervisory Board held a meeting in [[Munich]], [[West Germany]], after which board-chairman [[Franz Josef Strau\u00df]] released a statement, \"Airbus Industrie is now in a position to finalise the detailed technical definition of the TA9, which is now officially designated the A330, and the TA11, now called the A340, with potential launch customer airlines, and to discuss with them the terms and conditions for launch commitments\".<ref name=\"N&W p.27\"/> The designations were originally reversed because the airlines believed it illogical for a [[Twinjet|two-engine]] jet airliner to have a \"4\" in its name, whilst a quad-jet would not. On 12 May 1986, Airbus dispatched fresh sale proposals to five prospective airlines including [[Lufthansa]] and [[Swissair]].<ref name=\"N&W p.27\"/>\n\n===Production and testing===\nIn preparations for production of the A330/A340, Airbus's partners invested heavily in new facilities. [[Filton]] was the site of BAE's [[Pound sterling|\u00a3]]7&nbsp;million investment in a three-storey technical centre with an extra {{Convert|15000|m2|sqft}} of floor area.<ref name=\"N&W p.51\">{{harnvb|Norris|Wagner|2001|p=51}}</ref> BAe also spent \u00a35&nbsp;million expanding the [[Broughton, Flintshire|Broughton]] wing production plant by {{cvt|14000|m2|sqft}}<ref name=\"N&W p.51\"/> to accommodate a new production line. However, France saw the biggest changes with [[A\u00e9rospatiale]] starting construction of a new [[French franc|Fr.]]2.5&nbsp;billion ($411&nbsp;million) assembly plant, adjacent to [[Toulouse-Blagnac Airport]], in [[Colomiers]].<ref name=\"N&W p.52\">{{harnvb|Norris|Wagner|2001|p=52}}</ref> By November 1988, the first {{cvt|21|m|ft|adj=on}} pillars were erected for the new ''[[Cl\u00e9ment Ader]]'' assembly hall.<ref name=\"N&W p.52\"/> The assembly process, meanwhile, would feature increased automation with holes for the wing-fuselage mating process drilled by eight robots.<ref name=\"N&W p.53\">{{harvnb|Norris|Wagner|2001|p=53}}</ref> The use of automation for this particular process saved Airbus 20% on labour costs and 5% on time.<ref name=\"N&W p.53\"/>\n\n[[File:Airbus A340-211, Airbus Industrie AN0726637.jpg|thumb|An A340-200 demonstrator at the 1992 [[Farnborough Air Show]]]]\nBritish Aerospace accepted \u00a3450&nbsp;million funding from the UK government, short of the \u00a3750&nbsp;million originally requested.<ref name=\"N&W p.32\">{{harvnb|Norris|Wagner|2001|p=32}}</ref> Funds from the French and German governments followed thereafter.

From the moment of formation, Airbus had begun studies into derivatives of the Airbus A300B in support of this long-term goal.<ref>{{harvnb|Wensveen|2007|page=63}}</ref> Prior to the service introduction of the first Airbus airliners, Airbus had identified nine possible variations of the A300 known as A300B1 to B9.<ref name=\"gunston2009\">{{harvnb|Gunston|2009}}</ref> A tenth variation, conceived in 1973, later the first to be constructed, was designated the A300B10.<ref name=\"N&W p.18\">{{harvnb|Norris|Wagner|2001|p=18}}</ref> It was a smaller aircraft that would be developed into the long-range [[Airbus A310]]. Airbus then focused its efforts on the single-aisle market, which resulted in the [[Airbus A320 family]], which was the first digital [[fly-by-wire]] commercial aircraft. The decision to work on the A320, instead of a four-engine aircraft proposed by the Germans, created divisions within Airbus.<ref name=\"N&W p.18\"/> As the SA or \"single aisle\" studies (which later became the successful Airbus A320) underwent development to challenge the successful [[Boeing 737]] and [[Douglas DC-9]] in the single-aisle, [[Narrow-body aircraft|narrow-body airliner]] market, Airbus turned its focus back to the [[wide-body aircraft]] market.\n\nThe A300B11,<ref name=\"Eden p.30\"/> a derivative of the A310, was designed upon the availability of \"ten ton\" thrust engines.<ref name=\"N&W p.23\">{{harvnb|Norris|Wagner|2001|p=23}}</ref> Using four engines, it would seat between 180 and 200 passengers, and have a range of {{Convert|6000|nmi|km}|order=flip}.<ref>{{harvnb|Norris|Wagner|1999|p=59}}</ref> It was deemed a replacement for the less-efficient [[Boeing 707]]s and [[Douglas DC-8]]s still in service.<ref name=\"N&W p.23\"/> The A300B11 was joined by another design, the A300B9, which was a larger derivative of the A300. The B9 was developed by Airbus from the early 1970s at a slow pace until the early 1980s. It was essentially a stretched A300 with the same wing, coupled with the most powerful [[turbofan engine]] available at the time.<ref name=\"N&W p.23\"/> It was targeted at the growing demand for high-capacity, medium-range, transcontinental trunk routes.<ref name=\"N&W p.23\"/> The B9 offered the same [[Range (aircraft)|range]] and payload as the [[McDonnell Douglas DC-10]], but it used between 25%<ref name=\"N&W p.23\"/> to 38%<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/06/11/business/11air.html?_r=1|title=To Save Fuel, Airlines Find No Speck Too Small|work=The New York Times|last=Maynard|first=Micheline|date=11 June 2008}}</ref> less fuel.

Airbus vice president for strategic planning, Adam Brown, recalled,\n<blockquote>North American operators were clearly in favour of a twin[jet], while Asians wanted a quad[jet]. In Europe, opinion was split between the two. The majority of potential customers were in favour of a quad despite the fact, in certain conditions, it is more costly to operate than a twin. They liked that it could be ferried with one engine out, and could fly 'anywhere'\u2014 ETOPS (extend-range twin-engine operations) hadn't begun then.<ref>{{Cite journal|title=Airbus A330/A340|journal=Flight International|url=http://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1997/1997%20-%202917.html|accessdate=26 January 2011|last=Kingsley-Jones|first=Max|date=4 November 1997}}</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Norris|Wagner|2001|pp=22\u201323}}</ref></blockquote>\n\n===Design effort===\nThe first specifications of the TA9 and TA11 were released in 1982.<ref name=\"N&W p.24\">{{harvnb|Norris|Wagner|1999|p=24}}</ref> While the TA9 had a range of {{convert|3300|nmi|km|order=flip}}, the TA11 range was up to {{Convert|6830|nmi|km}|order=flip}.<ref name=\"N&W p.24\"/> At the same time, Airbus also sketched the TA12, a twin-engine derivative of the TA11, which was optimised for flights of a {{Convert|2000|nmi|km}|order=flip} lesser range.<ref name=\"N&W p.24\"/> By the time of the [[Paris Air Show]] in June 1985, more refinements had been made to the TA9 and TA11, including the adoption of the A320 [[Cockpit|flight deck]], [[fly-by-wire]] (FBW) [[Aircraft flight control system|flight control system]] and [[side-stick]] control.<ref name=\"N&W p.27\">{{harvnb|Norris|Wagner|2001|p=27}}</ref> Adopting a common cockpit across the new Airbus series allowed operators to make significant cost savings; flight crews would be able to transition from one to another after one week of training.<ref name=\"Lawrence p.73\">{{harvnb|Lawrence|Thornton|2005|p=73}}</ref> The TA11 and TA12 would use the front and rear fuselage sections of the A310.<ref>{{harvnb|Norris|Wagner|2001|p=24}}</ref> Components were modular and also interchangeable with other Airbus aircraft where possible<ref name=\"Lawrence p.73\"/> to reduce production, maintenance and operating costs.\n\n[[File:A340-642 flight deck.jpg|thumb|The A330/A340 shares a common flight deck with the A320.]]\nAirbus briefly considered a [[variable camber wing]]; the concept was that the wing could change its profile to produce the optimum shape for a given phase of flight. Studies were carried out by [[British Aerospace]] (BAe) at [[Hatfield, Hertfordshire|Hatfield]] and [[Bristol]]. Airbus estimated this would yield a 2% improvement in aerodynamic efficiency.<ref>{{harvnb|Norris|Wagner|2001|p=26}}</ref> However, the plan was later abandoned on grounds of cost and difficulty of development.<ref name=\"Eden p.30\"/>\n\nAirbus had held discussions with [[McDonnell Douglas]] to jointly produce the aircraft, which would have been designated as the ''AM 300''.<ref name=\"N&W p.28\">{{harvnb|Norris|Wagner|2001|p=28}}</ref> This aeroplane would have combined the wing of the A330 with the fuselage of the [[McDonnell Douglas MD-11]].<ref name=\"N&W p.28\"/> However, talks were terminated as McDonnell Douglas insisted on the continuation of its [[trijet]] heritage.<ref name=\"auto\">{{harvnb|Norris|Wagner|1999|p=67}}</ref> Although from the start it was intended that the A340 would be powered by four [[CFM56]]-5 [[turbofan engine]]s, each capable of {{Convert|25000|lbf|kN}},<ref>{{harvnb|Gunston|2009|p=201}}</ref> Airbus had also considered developing the aircraft as a trijet due to the limited power of engines available at the time, namely the [[Rolls-Royce RB211]]-535 and [[Pratt & Whitney JT10D]]-232<ref>{{harnvb|Norris|Wagner|2001|p=36}}</ref> (redesignated PW2000 in December 1980).\n\nAs refinements in the A340's design proceeded, a radical new engine option was offered by International Aero Engines, a group comprising Rolls-Royce, [[Pratt & Whitney]], [[Japanese Aero Engines Corporation]], [[Fiat]] and [[MTU Aero Engines]] (MTU). The [[Nacelle|engine nacelles]] of the superfan engine consisted of provisions to allow a large fan near the rear of the engine. As a result of the superfan cancellation by IAE, the [[CFM56]]-5C4 was used as the sole engine choice instead of there being an alternate option as originally envisioned. The longer-range versions, namely the A340-500 and -600, are powered by [[Rolls-Royce Trent 500]] engines.\n\nOn 27 January 1986, the Airbus Industrie Supervisory Board held a meeting in [[Munich]], [[West Germany]], after which board-chairman [[Franz Josef Strau\u00df]] released a statement, \"Airbus Industrie is now in a position to finalise the detailed technical definition of the TA9, which is now officially designated the A330, and the TA11, now called the A340, with potential launch customer airlines, and to discuss with them the terms and conditions for launch commitments\".<ref name=\"N&W p.27\"/> The designations were originally reversed because the airlines believed it illogical for a [[Twinjet|two-engine]] jet airliner to have a \"4\" in its name, whilst a quad-jet would not. On 12 May 1986, Airbus dispatched fresh sale proposals to five prospective airlines including [[Lufthansa]] and [[Swissair]].<ref name=\"N&W p.27\"/>\n\n===Production and testing===\nIn preparations for production of the A330/A340, Airbus's partners invested heavily in new facilities. [[Filton]] was the site of BAE's [[Pound sterling|\u00a3]]7&nbsp;million investment in a three-storey technical centre with an extra {{Convert|15000|m2|sqft}} of floor area.<ref name=\"N&W p.51\">{{harnvb|Norris|Wagner|2001|p=51}}</ref> BAe also spent \u00a35&nbsp;million expanding the [[Broughton, Flintshire|Broughton]] wing production plant by {{cvt|14000|m2|sqft}}<ref name=\"N&W p.51\"/> to accommodate a new production line. However, France saw the biggest changes with [[A\u00e9rospatiale]] starting construction of a new [[French franc|Fr.]]2.5&nbsp;billion ($411&nbsp;million) assembly plant, adjacent to [[Toulouse-Blagnac Airport]], in [[Colomiers]].<ref name=\"N&W p.52\">{{harnvb|Norris|Wagner|2001|p=52}}</ref> By November 1988, the first {{cvt|21|m|ft|adj=on}} pillars were erected for the new ''[[Cl\u00e9ment Ader]]'' assembly hall.<ref name=\"N&W p.52\"/> The assembly process, meanwhile, would feature increased automation with holes for the wing-fuselage mating process drilled by eight robots.<ref name=\"N&W p.53\">{{harvnb|Norris|Wagner|2001|p=53}}</ref> The use of automation for this particular process saved Airbus 20% on labour costs and 5% on time.<ref name=\"N&W p.53\"/>\n\n[[File:Airbus A340-211, Airbus Industrie AN0726637.jpg|thumb|An A340-200 demonstrator at the 1992 [[Farnborough Air Show]]]]\nBritish Aerospace accepted \u00a3450&nbsp;million funding from the UK government, short of the \u00a3750&nbsp;million originally requested.<ref name=\"N&W p.32\">{{harvnb|Norris|Wagner|2001|p=32}}</ref> Funds from the French and German governments followed thereafter.

Since 1972, he had become the Curator of University College North Wales Oriel, Bangor, for ten years.<ref>Art at the Minories Newspaper. 1983 Spring</ref>\n\n==Life==\nCullimore studied at [[Goldsmiths, University of London|Goldsmiths]]' School of Art.

His work picks up the tradition of English art where Blake, Palmer, Nash, Spenser and David Jones left off.

In his lyrics and his other writing he makes seemingly random use of decontextualized pieces of continental (mostly French) philosophy, and has built up a personal world he says is \"dominated by values like diversity, [[orientalism]], and a respect for otherness.\"<ref>{{cite web | title = Pubic Intellectual - An Anthology | publisher = [[Rough Trade Records | Rough Trade]] | url = https://www.roughtrade.com/gb/music/pubic-intellectual-an-anthology-1986-2016 | accessdate = 2018-04-24}}</ref>\n\n== Career ==\n=== Musical ===\nNicholas Currie's musical career began in 1981, with his band [[The Happy Family (band)|The Happy Family]], featuring ex-members of [[Josef K (band)|Josef K]], who made a single and a concept album ''The Man on Your Street: Songs of the Dictator Hall'' on hip UK indie label 4AD. \n\nIn 1986 Momus recorded an E.P. of his translations of Jacques Brel songs 'Nicky', and wrote a lengthy article on Brel for the New Statesman<ref>https://www.newstatesman.com/music/2009/10/brel-momus-song-death-world</ref> On October 22nd 2009 he performed at the Barbican alongside fellow Brel enthusiasts [[Marc Almond]] and [[Camille O'Sullivan]] at a celebration of Brel's career ''Carousel: The Songs of Jacques Brel''<ref>http://www.timeout.com/london/music/carousel-the-songs-of-jacques-brel-feat-arno-marc-almond-diamanda-galas-arthur-h-momus-camille-osullivan</ref>.\n\nHis album ''Don't Stop The Night'' included the single, \"The Hairstyle of the Devil\", which peaked at No. 94 in the [[UK Singles Chart]] in May 1989, and was a local hit, coming in at No. 32 on a year-end list, at San Francisco's [[KITS]] Live 105 radio station.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.rocklists.com/kits-1989.html|title=Live 105 Top 105.3 of 1989|website=Rocklists.com}}</ref>\n\nMomus's 80s albums were a great influence on Jarvis Cocker, who wrote to Currie asking him to produce future Pulp albums.  Those same albums were a huge influence on Brett Anderson<ref>Brett Anderson 'Lost Albums', ''NME'', Feb 12th 2012</ref>, Currie's championing of [[Suede]] following his friendship with Anderson and particularly bass player [[Justine Frishmann]] got them early attention, before she left to form [[Elastica]].  Momus also features in ''Bad Vibes'' the memoir of [[Luke Haines]]'s whom Currie dubbed 'The Hitler of Britpop'.\n\nIn the early 90s Momus struck up a working relationship with a number of J-Pop stars.  A cult audience for Momus and the indie labels he had released his early records on - particularly el records - led to the formation comunity of musicians in Shibuya, Tokyo, and the founding of Cru-el records, and the emergence of 'ShibuyaKei' artists such as Cornelius and The Poison Girlfriend - who performed Momus songs. Currie began writing specifically for nOrikO (aka the Poison Girlfriend) and Kahimi Karie. In 1995 Kahimi Karie's Momus penned song Good Morning World went to number one and was featured in a heavily syndicated advert, giving Currie his first real hit and financial stability for the first time.\n\nHe has been the subject of a number of documentaries including Hannu Puttonen's 'Man of Letters'.\n\n=== As author and other activities ===\nMomus said in 1991 that \"In the future everyone will be famous for fifteen people\", which has evolved into a [[Internet meme|meme]], \"On the web, everyone will be famous to fifteen people\".<ref name=\"fifteen-people\">{{cite web | title = POP STARS?

(born 11 February 1960), more popularly known under the [[artist name]] '''Momus''' (after the [[Momus|Greek god of mockery]]), is a [[Scotland|Scottish]] songwriter, author, blogger, and former journalist for ''[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]]''.\n\nFor over thirty years he has been releasing albums on labels in the United Kingdom, the United States, and Japan. In his lyrics and his other writing he makes seemingly random use of decontextualized pieces of continental (mostly French) philosophy, and has built up a personal world he says is \"dominated by values like diversity, [[orientalism]], and a respect for otherness.\"<ref>{{cite web | title = Pubic Intellectual - An Anthology | publisher = [[Rough Trade Records | Rough Trade]] | url = https://www.roughtrade.com/gb/music/pubic-intellectual-an-anthology-1986-2016 | accessdate = 2018-04-24}}</ref>\n\n== Career ==\n=== Musical ===\nNicholas Currie's musical career began in 1981, with his band [[The Happy Family (band)|The Happy Family]], featuring ex-members of [[Josef K (band)|Josef K]], who made a single and a concept album ''The Man on Your Street: Songs of the Dictator Hall'' on hip UK indie label 4AD. \n\nIn 1986 Momus recorded an E.P. of his translations of Jacques Brel songs 'Nicky', and write a lengthy article on Brel for the New Statesman<ref>https://www.newstatesman.com/music/2009/10/brel-momus-song-death-world</ref> On October 22nd 2009 he performed at the Barbican alongside fellow Brel enthusiasts [[Marc Almond]] and [[Camille O'Sullivan]] at a celebration of Brel's career ''Carousel: The Songs of Jacques Brel''<ref>http://www.timeout.com/london/music/carousel-the-songs-of-jacques-brel-feat-arno-marc-almond-diamanda-galas-arthur-h-momus-camille-osullivan</ref>.\n\nHis album ''Don't Stop The Night'' included the single, \"The Hairstyle of the Devil\", which peaked at No. 94 in the [[UK Singles Chart]] in May 1989, and was a local hit, coming in at No. 32 on a year-end list, at San Francisco's [[KITS]] Live 105 radio station.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.rocklists.com/kits-1989.html|title=Live 105 Top 105.3 of 1989|website=Rocklists.com}}</ref>\n\nMomus's 80s albums were a great influence on Jarvis Cocker, who wrote to Currie asking him to produce future Pulp albums.  Those same albums were a huge influence on Brett Anderson<ref>Brett Anderson 'Lost Albums', ''NME'', Feb 12th 2012</ref>, Currie's championing of [[Suede]] following his friendship with Anderson and particularly bass player [[Justine Frishmann]] got them early attention, before she left to form [[Elastica]].  Momus also features in ''Bad Vibes'' the memoir of [[Luke Haines]]'s whom Currie dubbed 'The Hitler of Britpop'.\n\nIn the early 90s Momus struck up a working relationship with a number of J-Pop stars.  A cult audience for Momus and the indie labels he had released his early records on - particularly el records - led to the formation comunity of musicians in Shibuya, Tokyo, and the founding of Cru-el records, and the emergence of 'ShibuyaKei' artists such as Cornelius and The Poison Girlfriend - who performed Momus songs. Currie began writing specifically for nOrikO (aka the Poison Girlfriend) and Kahimi Karie. In 1995 Kahimi Karie's Momus penned song Good Morning World went to number one and was featured in a heavily syndicated advert, giving Currie his first real hit and financial stability for the first time.\n\nHe has been the subject of a number of documentaries including Hannu Puttonen's 'Man of Letters'.\n\n=== As author and other activities ===\nMomus said in 1991 that \"In the future everyone will be famous for fifteen people\", which has evolved into a [[Internet meme|meme]], \"On the web, everyone will be famous to fifteen people\".<ref name=\"fifteen-people\">{{cite web | title = POP STARS?

''The Book of Jokes'' and ''The Book of Scotlands'' have received positive reviews in the LA Times and the Guardian. ''The Book of Scotlands'' (Sternberg Press) was shortlisted for the Scottish Arts Council's First Book prize.

[[Soup]]s have been made since [[Ancient history|ancient times]].\n\nSome soups are served with large chunks of meat or vegetables left in the liquid, while others are served as a broth. A [[broth]] is a flavored liquid usually derived from boiling a type of meat with bone, a spice mix, or a vegetable mix for a period of time in a [[Stock (food)|stock]]. A common type of broth is [[consomm\u00e9]], which is a crystal clear broth or stock that has a full flavor, aroma, and body.\n\nA [[potage]] is a category of thick soups, [[stew]]s, or [[porridge]]s, in some of which meat and vegetables are boiled together with water until they form a thick mush.\n\n[[Bisque (food)|Bisques]] are [[heavy cream]] soups traditionally prepared with [[shellfish]], but can be made with any type of [[seafood]] or other base ingredients. Cream soups are dairy based soups. Although they may be consumed on their own, or with a meal, the canned, condensed form of cream soup is sometimes used as a quick [[sauce]] in a variety of [[meat]] and [[pasta]] [[convenience food]] dishes, such as [[casserole]]s. Similar to bisques, [[chowder]]s are thick soups usually containing some type of starch.\n\n[[Coulis]] were originally meat juices, and now are thick [[pur\u00e9e]]s.\n\nSome soups are served only cold, and other soups can optionally be served cold.\n<!--\n                                                              EDITORIAL NOTES:\n+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\nDo NOT add stews or sauces here.

[[Soup]]s have been made since [[Ancient history|ancient times]].\n\nSome soups are served with large chunks of meat or vegetables left in the liquid, while a [[broth]] is a flavored liquid usually derived from boiling a type of meat with bone, a spice mix, or a vegetable mix for a period of time in a [[Stock (food)|stock]]. A common type of broth is [[consomm\u00e9]], which are crystal clear broths or stock that have a full flavor, aroma, and body.\n\nA [[potage]] is a category of thick soups, [[stew]]s, or [[porridge]]s, in some of which meat and vegetables are boiled together with water until they form into a thick mush.\n\n[[Bisque (food)|Bisques]] are [[heavy cream]] soups traditionally prepared with [[shellfish]], but can be made with any type of [[seafood]] or other base ingredients. Cream soups are a dairy based soup. Although they may be consumed on their own, or with a meal, the canned, condensed form of cream soup is sometimes used as a quick [[sauce]] in a variety of [[meat]] and [[pasta]] [[convenience food]] dishes, such as [[casserole]]s. Similar to a bisque, [[chowder]]s are thick soups usually containing some type of starch.\n\n[[Coulis]] were originally meat juices, and now are thick [[pur\u00e9e]]s.\n\nSome soups are served only cold, and other soups can optionally be served cold.\n<!--\n                                                              EDITORIAL NOTES:\n+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\nDo NOT add stews or sauces here.

A fan of the guitarist [[Chet Atkins]], Moore led a group called the Starlite Wranglers before [[Sam Phillips]] at [[Sun Records]] put him together with then-teenage [[Elvis Presley]]. The trio was completed with the bass player [[Bill Black]], who brought a \"rhythmic propulsion\" that much pleased Phillips. <ref name=\"Guralnick 1994, p. 95\">Guralnick (1994), p. 95</ref> In 1954, Moore and Black accompanied Elvis on what would become the first legendary Presley hit, the [[The Sun Sessions|Sun Studios session]] cut of \"[[That's All Right]]\", a recording regarded as a seminal event in [[rock and roll]] history. <ref>{{cite book|title=Deep Blues|author=Robert Palmer|authorlink=Robert Palmer (writer)|publisher=[[Penguin Books]]|page=[https://archive.org/details/deepblues00palm/page/241 241]|isbn=978-0-14-006223-6|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/deepblues00palm/page/241}}</ref>\n\nThis session, held on the evening of July 5, 1954, proved entirely unfruitful until late in the night. As they were about to give up and go home, Presley took his guitar and launched into a 1946 blues number, Arthur Crudup's \"That's All Right\". Moore recalled,<blockquote>All of a sudden, Elvis just started singing this song, jumping around and acting the fool and then Bill picked up his bass and he started acting the fool too, and I started playing with them. Sam, I think, had the door to the control booth open...he stuck his head out and said, \"What are you doing?\" And we said, \"We don't know.\" \"Well, back up,\" he said, \"try to find a place to start and do it again.\" Phillips quickly began taping as this was the sound he had been looking for. <ref>Peter Guralnick, ''Last Train to Memphis: The Rise of Elvis Presley''. Little, Brown, 1994, p. 94-97 {{ISBN|0-316-33225-9}}</ref></blockquote>During the next few days, the trio recorded a [[Bluegrass music|bluegrass]] number, [[Bill Monroe]]'s \"[[Blue Moon of Kentucky]]\", again in a distinctive style and employing a jury-rigged echo effect that Sam Phillips dubbed \"[[Delay (audio effect)#Slapback echo|slapback]]\". A single was pressed with \"That's All Right\" on the A side and \"Blue Moon of Kentucky\" on the reverse.<ref>Guralnick (1994), p. 102\u201304</ref>\n\nPhillips' rhythm-centered vision led him to steer Moore away from the pretty finger-picking style of Chet Atkins, which he deemed fine for pop or country but not for the simple, gutsy sound Phillips was aiming at.<ref>Jorgensen (1998), p. 18</ref> ''Simplify'' was the keyword.<ref name=\"Guralnick 1994, p. 95\"/>\n\nBy his performance at the [[Louisiana Hayride]] in October 1954, Presley, Black and Moore were called the [[Blue Moon Boys]].<ref>Jorgensen (1998), p. 19</ref>\n\nFor a time, Moore served as Presley's personal manager. <ref name=\"dickerson2005\">{{cite book |title=That's Alright, Elvis:The Untold Story of Elvis's First Guitarist and Manager |first1=Scotty |last1=Moore |first2=James L. |last2=Dickerson |year=2005| publisher=[[G.

Beginning in July 1954, the Blue Moon Boys toured and recorded throughout the [[American South]] and as Presley's popularity rose, they toured the United States and made appearances in various Presley television shows and motion pictures. The Blue Moon Boys, including Moore, appear in the few surviving 1955 home movie clips of Presley before he achieved national recognition. Moore, Black and Fontana also appeared on the [[Dorsey Brothers]], [[Milton Berle]], [[The Steve Allen Show|Steve Allen]], and [[The Ed Sullivan Show|Ed Sullivan]] live TV shows from January 1956 to January 1957. Moore and Fontana also reunited on the 1960 Timex TV special with [[Frank Sinatra]] welcoming Presley upon his return from service in the U.S. Army.{{Citation needed|date=June 2014}}\n\nMoore played on many of Presley's most famous recordings, including \"[[That's All Right]]\", \"[[Good Rocking Tonight|Good Rockin' Tonight]]\", \"[[Milk Cow Blues|Milkcow Blues Boogie]]\", \"Baby Let's Play House\" (where Elvis introduced the vocal stutter to the music pundits), \"[[Heartbreak Hotel]]\", \"[[Mystery Train]]\", \"[[Blue Suede Shoes]]\", \"[[Hound Dog (song)|Hound Dog]]\", \"Too Much\", \"[[Jailhouse Rock (song)|Jailhouse Rock]]\", and \"[[Hard Headed Woman]]\". He called his solo on \"Hound Dog\" \"ancient psychedelia\".<ref>Quoted in Guralnick (1994), p. 298</ref> \n\nDuring the filming and recording of ''Loving You'' in Hollywood in early 1957, Moore and Black drove the boredom away by jamming with Presley between takes but they usually saw little of Presley, who stayed only a couple of floors away from them. They grew hurt and resentful at the separation, which they came to perceive as willfully organized. <ref>Guralnick (1994), p. 391</ref>\n\nThey did not accompany Presley on the soundtrack recordings for his first movie, ''[[Love Me Tender (film)|Love Me Tender]]'', because 20th Century Fox had refused to allow him to use his own band, with the excuse that they could not play country. <ref>Jorgensen (1998), pp. 57\u201358.</ref> By December 1956, they were experiencing financial difficulties because there had been few performances since August: when there were, they received $200 a week (US${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|200|1956}}}} in {{Inflation-year|US}} dollars{{inflation-fn|US}}), but only $100 (US${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|100|1956}}}} in {{Inflation-year|US}} dollars{{inflation-fn|US}}) when there were not. Moore and his wife were forced to move in with her three sisters and brother-in-law. In an interview with the Memphis ''Press-Scimitar'' that December, they spoke about this and their lack of contact with Presley himself. The reason for the interview was their announcement that management had given them permission to record an instrumental album of their own, which [[RCA Victor]] would release. Such permission was needed in order to appear as a group without Presley.<ref>Guralnick (1994), p. 378.</ref>\n\nDuring Presley's 1957 tour of Canada, the concert promoter Oscar Davis offered to represent them as their manager. Moore and Black, who had seen Presley become a millionaire while still earning $200 or $100 a week themselves, were willing to work with Davis but the backing vocalists, the Jordanaires, were not, because they did not trust him.<ref>Guralnick (1994), p. 400-01</ref>They lived off mostly $100 a week. True, Presley, too, had been paid only $100 a week, like them, but that was back in 1956. Once Hollywood had been introduced, Presley\u2019s salary had witnessed a dramatic rise, while Moore and Black continued living off $100 a week.\n\nTension hit breaking point right after the September 1957 sessions for Presley's first Christmas album. Moore and Black had been promised an opportunity to jam with Elvis after the session, on Presley's studio time. Yet when the session was over, they were told to pack up and leave. That same evening, the duo wrote a letter of resignation. They had only had one raise in two years and with the lack of personal appearances had to live off $100 a week, which was getting to be too difficult. They also deduced (correctly) the Colonel was working against them. They had been denied virtually all access to Presley and felt as if \"they were no longer even permitted to talk to him\u201d. <ref>Guralnick (1994), p. 432</ref> Colonel Parker didn't interfere but RCA Victor executive Steve Sholes, who had little regard for the ability of Presley's band, hoped the separation would be permanent. Back in Memphis, a journalist found out and interviewed the duo. Presley responded with a press statement wishing them good luck, saying things could have been worked out if they had come to him first instead of bringing it to the press. In an accompanying interview, Presley revealed that during the last two years, people had tried to convince him to get rid of his band so from his point of view he had stayed loyal to them.<ref>Guralnick (1994), p. 434</ref>\n\nPresley was scheduled to appear in Tupelo within the next two weeks and started to audition new musicians. He performed with [[Hank Garland]] on guitar and D.J. Fontana's friend, Chuck Wiginton, on bass but despite their musical ability it didn't feel the same to him. The week after his Tupelo engagement he hired them back on a per diem basis. In the meantime, the duo had played \"a miserable two-week engagement at the Dallas State Fair.\" Moore declared there were no hard feelings, though Presley himself, according to biographer Guralnick, seems to have taken a more melancholic view. One day, Guralnick writes, Presley heard \"Jailhouse Rock\" on the radio \"and declared, 'Elvis Presley and his one-man band,' with a rueful shake of his head.\"<ref>Guralnick (1994), p. 435.</ref>\n\nMoore and the Blue Moon Boys performed (and have additional small walk-on and speaking roles) with Presley in four of his movies (''[[Loving You (1957 film)|Loving You]]'', ''[[Jailhouse Rock (film)|Jailhouse Rock]]'', ''[[King Creole]]'', and ''[[G.I. Blues]]'') filmed in 1957, 1958 and 1960.\n\nEarly in 1958, when Presley was drafted, Moore began working at [[Fernwood Records]] and produced a hit record, \"Tragedy\", for [[Thomas Wayne (singer)|Thomas Wayne Perkins]], the brother of [[Johnny Cash]]'s guitarist [[Luther Perkins]].{{Citation needed|date=June 2014}}\n\nIn 1960, Moore commenced recording sessions with Presley at RCA Victor and also served as production manager at Sam Phillips Recording Service, which involved supervising all aspects of studio operation. Moore played on such Presley songs as \"Fame and Fortune\", \"Such a Night\", \"Frankfort Special\", \"Surrender\", \"I Feel So Bad\", \"Rock-a-Hula Baby\", \"Kiss Me Quick\", \"Good Luck Charm\", \"She's Not You\", \"(You're the) Devil in Disguise\", and \"Bossa Nova Baby\". Moore remained as a guitarist for the majority of songs recorded after Presley's work was dominated by Hollywood sessions. He mostly played rhythm guitar however, with his last lead guitar work occurring by 1962.\n\nIn 1964, Moore released a solo album on Epic Records called ''The Guitar That Changed the World'', played using his [[Gibson Super 400]]. For this effort he was fired by Sam Phillips. The reason for this was that the people just couldn\u2019t tolerate hearing the music without the king himself in front. To make things worse, Phillips wasn\u2019t unaware of the project. Once he got the hang of it, he promptly showed Moore the door. He reunited with Fontana and Presley for the [[NBC]] television special known as the ''[[Elvis (1968 TV program)|'68 Comeback Special]]'', again with his Gibson Super 400, which was also played by Presley. This special was the last time these musicians would play with Presley, and for Moore it was the last time he ever saw him.<ref>Guralnick (1999), p. 317</ref>It is claimed that Moore had wept at seeing Presley after so long. Little was he to know that it\u2019d be his last.\n\n===Style and influence===\nMoore's playing on his Gibson with his unique [[finger-picking]] style using a thumbpick, as on the Sun and early RCA Victor recordings, represented a move of the [[Chet Atkins]] style into a more [[rockabilly]] mode. Moore's best performances are often considered precedent-setting.\n\nOf Presley's first single \"[[That's All Right]]\", the critic [[Dave Marsh]] wrote that \"Moore's guitar\u2014especially the solo\u2014toughens the song up and forces it to rock.\" <ref>Marsh, Dave (1989). ''The Heart of Rock & Soul: The 1001 Greatest Singles Ever Made.'' London: Penguin Books. p. 213. {{ISBN|0140121080}}</ref> Though Marsh credits Presley with introducing \"the vocal stutter\" on \"[[Baby Let's Play House]]\", \"Other than that, it's guitarist Scotty Moore's show and he sets a few precedents of his own.\"<ref>Marsh (1989), p. 317.</ref> Of the other Sun recordings, Marsh cited the \"urgent Scotty Moore guitar lick\" as a standout element of \"[[Mystery Train]]\",<ref>Marsh (1989), p. 16.</ref> while \"[[Good Rockin' Tonight]]\" displays his \"stinging guitar\".<ref>Marsh (1989), p. 46.</ref>Scotty added a touch of reverb to his guitar. And it ended up being a very good call.\n\nIn Marsh's description, the teamwork of Moore and other musicians turns the 1957 single and movie title song \"Jailhouse Rock\" into an \"enduring smash for at least three reasons: the great walking bass, Scotty Moore's invention of power chording, and D.J. Fontana's drumming, which is halfway between strip joint rhumba and the perfect New Orleans shuffle.\"<ref>Marsh (1989), p. 540.</ref>\n\nOn the 1961, post-Army Presley single \"Little Sister\", \"Scotty Moore comes up with his greatest post-Sun guitar lick and not only converts a comparatively humdrum Pomus-Shuman teen love triangle number into the best of Elvis's early sixties hits but (together with D.J. Fontana's heavy-footed thunderation) gives more than a few pointers toward the metallic rock to come.\" <ref>Marsh (1989), p. 288.</ref> According to Presley discographer Ernst Jorgensen however, Hank Garland was the lead guitarist on the song, while Moore played acoustic guitar.<ref>Jorgensen (1998), p. 159.</ref>\n\nMoore is given credit as a pioneer rock 'n' roll lead guitarist, though he characteristically downplayed his own innovative role in the development of the style. \"It had been there for quite a while\", recalled Moore. \"Carl Perkins was doing basically the same sort of thing up around Jackson and I know for a fact Jerry Lee Lewis had been playing that kind of music ever since he was ten years old.\"<ref>Cited in Peter Guralnick (1989), ''Lost Highway: Journeys & Arrivals of American Musicians'', p. 104.</ref> Paul Friedlander describes the defining elements of rockabilly, which he similarly characterizes as \"essentially&nbsp;... an Elvis Presley construction\": \"the raw, emotive, and slurred vocal style and emphasis on rhythmic feeling [of] the blues with the string band and strummed rhythm guitar [of] country\".<ref>Friedlander, Paul (1996). ''Rock and Roll: A Social History''. Westview p. 45. {{ISBN|0813327253}}</ref> In \"That's All Right\", the Presley trio's first record, Moore's guitar solo, \"a combination of [[Merle Travis]]\u2013style country finger-picking, double-stop slides from acoustic boogie and blues-based bent-note, single-string work, is a microcosm of this fusion.\"<ref>Friedlander (1996), p. 45.</ref>\n\nMany popular guitarists cite Moore as the performer that brought the lead guitarist to a dominant role in a rock 'n' roll band.{{Citation needed|date=June 2014}} Although some lead guitarists and vocalists, such as [[Chuck Berry]] and the blues legend [[BB King]], had gained popularity by the 1950s, Presley rarely played his own lead while performing, instead providing rhythm guitar and leaving the lead duties to Moore. As a guitarist, Moore was a noticeable presence in Presley's performances despite his introverted demeanor. He became an inspiration to many subsequent popular guitarists, including [[George Harrison]], [[Jeff Beck]], and [[Keith Richards]] of the [[Rolling Stones]].<ref name=\"nytobit\"/> While Moore was working on his memoir with co-author James L.

As they were about to give up and go home, Presley took his guitar and launched into a 1946 blues number, Arthur Crudup's \"That's All Right\". Moore recalled,<blockquote>All of a sudden, Elvis just started singing this song, jumping around and acting the fool and then Bill picked up his bass and he started acting the fool too, and I started playing with them. Sam, I think, had the door to the control booth open...he stuck his head out and said, \"What are you doing?\" And we said, \"We don't know.\" \"Well, back up,\" he said, \"try to find a place to start and do it again.\" Phillips quickly began taping as this was the sound he had been looking for. <ref>Peter Guralnick, ''Last Train to Memphis: The Rise of Elvis Presley''.

Beginning in July 1954, the Blue Moon Boys toured and recorded throughout the [[American South]] and as Presley's popularity rose, they toured the United States and made appearances in various Presley television shows and motion pictures. The Blue Moon Boys, including Moore, appear in the few surviving 1955 home movie clips of Presley before he achieved national recognition. Moore, Black and Fontana also appeared on the [[Dorsey Brothers]], [[Milton Berle]], [[The Steve Allen Show|Steve Allen]], and [[The Ed Sullivan Show|Ed Sullivan]] live TV shows from January 1956 to January 1957. Moore and Fontana also reunited on the 1960 Timex TV special with [[Frank Sinatra]] welcoming Presley upon his return from service in the U.S. Army.{{Citation needed|date=June 2014}}\n\nMoore played on many of Presley's most famous recordings, including \"[[That's All Right]]\", \"[[Good Rocking Tonight|Good Rockin' Tonight]]\", <nowiki>[[\u201cMilk Cow Blues Boogie\"]]</nowiki>, \u201cBaby Let's Play House\" (where Elvis introduced the vocal stutter to the music pundits), \"[[Heartbreak Hotel]]\", \"[[Mystery Train]]\", \"[[Blue Suede Shoes]]\", \"[[Hound Dog (song)|Hound Dog]]\", \"Too Much\", \"[[Jailhouse Rock (song)|Jailhouse Rock]]\", and \"[[Hard Headed Woman]]\". He called his solo on \"Hound Dog\" \"ancient psychedelia\".<ref>Quoted in Guralnick (1994), p. 298</ref> \n\nDuring the filming and recording of ''Loving You'' in Hollywood in early 1957, Moore and Black drove the boredom away by jamming with Presley between takes but they usually saw little of Presley, who stayed only a couple of floors away from them. They grew hurt and resentful at the separation, which they came to perceive as willfully organized. <ref>Guralnick (1994), p. 391</ref>\n\nThey did not accompany Presley on the soundtrack recordings for his first movie, ''[[Love Me Tender (film)|Love Me Tender]]'', because 20th Century Fox had refused to allow him to use his own band, with the excuse that they could not play country. <ref>Jorgensen (1998), pp. 57\u201358.</ref> By December 1956, they were experiencing financial difficulties because there had been few performances since August: when there were, they received $200 a week (US${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|200|1956}}}} in {{Inflation-year|US}} dollars{{inflation-fn|US}}), but only $100 (US${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|100|1956}}}} in {{Inflation-year|US}} dollars{{inflation-fn|US}}) when there were not. Moore and his wife were forced to move in with her three sisters and brother-in-law. In an interview with the Memphis ''Press-Scimitar'' that December, they spoke about this and their lack of contact with Presley himself. The reason for the interview was their announcement that management had given them permission to record an instrumental album of their own, which [[RCA Victor]] would release. Such permission was needed in order to appear as a group without Presley.<ref>Guralnick (1994), p. 378.</ref>\n\nDuring Presley's 1957 tour of Canada, the concert promoter Oscar Davis offered to represent them as their manager. Moore and Black, who had seen Presley become a millionaire while still earning $200 or $100 a week themselves, were willing to work with Davis but the backing vocalists, the Jordanaires, were not, because they did not trust him.<ref>Guralnick (1994), p. 400-01</ref>They lived off mostly $100 a week. True, Presley, too, had been paid only $100 a week, like them, but that was back in 1956. Once Hollywood had been introduced, Presley\u2019s salary had witnessed a dramatic rise, while Moore and Black continued living off $100 a week.\n\nTension hit breaking point right after the September 1957 sessions for Presley's first Christmas album. Moore and Black had been promised an opportunity to jam with Elvis after the session, on Presley's studio time. Yet when the session was over, they were told to pack up and leave. That same evening, the duo wrote a letter of resignation. They had only had one raise in two years and with the lack of personal appearances had to live off $100 a week, which was getting to be too difficult. They also deduced (correctly) the Colonel was working against them. They had been denied virtually all access to Presley and felt as if \"they were no longer even permitted to talk to him\u201d. <ref>Guralnick (1994), p. 432</ref> Colonel Parker didn't interfere but RCA Victor executive Steve Sholes, who had little regard for the ability of Presley's band, hoped the separation would be permanent. Back in Memphis, a journalist found out and interviewed the duo. Presley responded with a press statement wishing them good luck, saying things could have been worked out if they had come to him first instead of bringing it to the press. In an accompanying interview, Presley revealed that during the last two years, people had tried to convince him to get rid of his band so from his point of view he had stayed loyal to them.<ref>Guralnick (1994), p. 434</ref>\n\nPresley was scheduled to appear in Tupelo within the next two weeks and started to audition new musicians. He performed with [[Hank Garland]] on guitar and D.J. Fontana's friend, Chuck Wiginton, on bass but despite their musical ability it didn't feel the same to him. The week after his Tupelo engagement he hired them back on a per diem basis. In the meantime, the duo had played \"a miserable two-week engagement at the Dallas State Fair.\" Moore declared there were no hard feelings, though Presley himself, according to biographer Guralnick, seems to have taken a more melancholic view. One day, Guralnick writes, Presley heard \"Jailhouse Rock\" on the radio \"and declared, 'Elvis Presley and his one-man band,' with a rueful shake of his head.\"<ref>Guralnick (1994), p. 435.</ref>\n\nMoore and the Blue Moon Boys performed (and have additional small walk-on and speaking roles) with Presley in four of his movies (''[[Loving You (1957 film)|Loving You]]'', ''[[Jailhouse Rock (film)|Jailhouse Rock]]'', ''[[King Creole]]'', and ''[[G.I. Blues]]'') filmed in 1957, 1958 and 1960.\n\nEarly in 1958, when Presley was drafted, Moore began working at [[Fernwood Records]] and produced a hit record, \"Tragedy\", for [[Thomas Wayne (singer)|Thomas Wayne Perkins]], the brother of [[Johnny Cash]]'s guitarist [[Luther Perkins]].{{Citation needed|date=June 2014}}\n\nIn 1960, Moore commenced recording sessions with Presley at RCA Victor and also served as production manager at Sam Phillips Recording Service, which involved supervising all aspects of studio operation. Moore played on such Presley songs as \"Fame and Fortune\", \"Such a Night\", \"Frankfort Special\", \"Surrender\", \"I Feel So Bad\", \"Rock-a-Hula Baby\", \"Kiss Me Quick\", \"Good Luck Charm\", \"She's Not You\", \"(You're the) Devil in Disguise\", and \"Bossa Nova Baby\". Moore remained as a guitarist for the majority of songs recorded after Presley's work was dominated by Hollywood sessions. He mostly played rhythm guitar however, with his last lead guitar work occurring by 1962.\n\nIn 1964, Moore released a solo album on Epic Records called ''The Guitar That Changed the World'', played using his [[Gibson Super 400]]. For this effort he was fired by Sam Phillips. The reason for this was that the people just couldn\u2019t tolerate hearing the music without the king himself in front. To make things worse, Phillips wasn\u2019t unaware of the project. Once he got the hang of it, he promptly showed Moore the door. He reunited with Fontana and Presley for the [[NBC]] television special known as the ''[[Elvis (1968 TV program)|'68 Comeback Special]]'', again with his Gibson Super 400, which was also played by Presley. This special was the last time these musicians would play with Presley, and for Moore it was the last time he ever saw him.<ref>Guralnick (1999), p. 317</ref>It is claimed that Moore had wept at seeing Presley after so long. Little was he to know that it\u2019d be his last.\n\n===Style and influence===\nMoore's playing on his Gibson with his unique [[finger-picking]] style using a thumbpick, as on the Sun and early RCA Victor recordings, represented a move of the [[Chet Atkins]] style into a more [[rockabilly]] mode. Moore's best performances are often considered precedent-setting.\n\nOf Presley's first single \"[[That's All Right]]\", the critic [[Dave Marsh]] wrote that \"Moore's guitar\u2014especially the solo\u2014toughens the song up and forces it to rock.\" <ref>Marsh, Dave (1989). ''The Heart of Rock & Soul: The 1001 Greatest Singles Ever Made.'' London: Penguin Books. p. 213. {{ISBN|0140121080}}</ref> Though Marsh credits Presley with introducing \"the vocal stutter\" on \"[[Baby Let's Play House]]\", \"Other than that, it's guitarist Scotty Moore's show and he sets a few precedents of his own.\"<ref>Marsh (1989), p. 317.</ref> Of the other Sun recordings, Marsh cited the \"urgent Scotty Moore guitar lick\" as a standout element of \"[[Mystery Train]]\",<ref>Marsh (1989), p. 16.</ref> while \"[[Good Rockin' Tonight]]\" displays his \"stinging guitar\".<ref>Marsh (1989), p. 46.</ref>Scotty added a touch of reverb to his guitar. And it ended up being a very good call.\n\nIn Marsh's description, the teamwork of Moore and other musicians turns the 1957 single and movie title song \"Jailhouse Rock\" into an \"enduring smash for at least three reasons: the great walking bass, Scotty Moore's invention of power chording, and D.J. Fontana's drumming, which is halfway between strip joint rhumba and the perfect New Orleans shuffle.\"<ref>Marsh (1989), p. 540.</ref>\n\nOn the 1961, post-Army Presley single \"Little Sister\", \"Scotty Moore comes up with his greatest post-Sun guitar lick and not only converts a comparatively humdrum Pomus-Shuman teen love triangle number into the best of Elvis's early sixties hits but (together with D.J. Fontana's heavy-footed thunderation) gives more than a few pointers toward the metallic rock to come.\" <ref>Marsh (1989), p. 288.</ref> According to Presley discographer Ernst Jorgensen however, Hank Garland was the lead guitarist on the song, while Moore played acoustic guitar.<ref>Jorgensen (1998), p. 159.</ref>\n\nMoore is given credit as a pioneer rock 'n' roll lead guitarist, though he characteristically downplayed his own innovative role in the development of the style. \"It had been there for quite a while\", recalled Moore. \"Carl Perkins was doing basically the same sort of thing up around Jackson and I know for a fact Jerry Lee Lewis had been playing that kind of music ever since he was ten years old.\"<ref>Cited in Peter Guralnick (1989), ''Lost Highway: Journeys & Arrivals of American Musicians'', p. 104.</ref> Paul Friedlander describes the defining elements of rockabilly, which he similarly characterizes as \"essentially&nbsp;... an Elvis Presley construction\": \"the raw, emotive, and slurred vocal style and emphasis on rhythmic feeling [of] the blues with the string band and strummed rhythm guitar [of] country\".<ref>Friedlander, Paul (1996). ''Rock and Roll: A Social History''. Westview p. 45. {{ISBN|0813327253}}</ref> In \"That's All Right\", the Presley trio's first record, Moore's guitar solo, \"a combination of [[Merle Travis]]\u2013style country finger-picking, double-stop slides from acoustic boogie and blues-based bent-note, single-string work, is a microcosm of this fusion.\"<ref>Friedlander (1996), p. 45.</ref>\n\nMany popular guitarists cite Moore as the performer that brought the lead guitarist to a dominant role in a rock 'n' roll band.{{Citation needed|date=June 2014}} Although some lead guitarists and vocalists, such as [[Chuck Berry]] and the blues legend [[BB King]], had gained popularity by the 1950s, Presley rarely played his own lead while performing, instead providing rhythm guitar and leaving the lead duties to Moore. As a guitarist, Moore was a noticeable presence in Presley's performances despite his introverted demeanor. He became an inspiration to many subsequent popular guitarists, including [[George Harrison]], [[Jeff Beck]], and [[Keith Richards]] of the [[Rolling Stones]].<ref name=\"nytobit\"/> While Moore was working on his memoir with co-author James L. Dickerson, Richards told Dickerson, \"Everyone else wanted to be Elvis\u2014I wanted to be Scotty.\" <ref name=\"dickerson2005\" />{{rp|xiii}} Richards has stated many times (in ''Rolling Stone'' magazine and in his autobiography, ''Life'') that he could never figure out how to play the \"stop time\" break and figure that Moore played on \"I'm Left, You're Right, She's Gone\" (Sun) and that he hopes it will remain a mystery.{{Citation needed|date=June 2014}}\n\n===Equipment===\nWhile with Presley, Moore initially played a [[Gibson Guitar Corporation|Gibson]] ES-295 (nicknamed \"The Guitar That Changed the World\")<ref>{{cite book |last1=Marcus |first1=Greil |author-link1=Greil Marcus |last2=Guralnick |first2=Peter |author-link2=Peter Guralnick |last3=Sante |first3=Luc |author-link3=Luc Sante |last4=Gordon |first4=Robert |author-link4=Robert Gordon (musician) |title=Rockabilly: The Twang Heard 'Round the World: The Illustrated History |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=06VWZ69WBAEC&pg=PA40 |year=2011 |publisher=[[Voyageur Press]] |isbn=978-0-7603-4062-2 |page=40}}</ref> before switching to a [[Gibson L5]]<ref>{{cite book |last=Carter |first=Walter |title=Gibson Electric Guitar Book: Seventy Years of Classic Guitars |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=p5f2rT3kUscC&pg=PA42 |year=2007 |publisher=[[Hal Leonard Corporation|Hal Leonard]] |isbn=978-0879308957 |page=42}}</ref> and subsequently a [[Gibson Super 400]].<ref name=\"hunter\">{{cite book |last=Hunter|first=Dave|title=Guitar Rigs: Classic Guitar and Amp Combinations |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=p1-kULtG9tgC&pg=PA50 |year=2005 |publisher=[[Hal Leonard Corporation|Hal Leonard]] |isbn=978-0-87930-851-3|pages=40, 54}}</ref>\n\nOne of the key pieces of equipment in Moore's sound on many of the recordings with Presley, besides his guitars, was the [[Ray Butts EchoSonic]], first used by Chet Atkins, a guitar amplifier with a [[tape echo]] built in, which allowed him to take his trademark [[Delay (audio effect)|slapback echo]] on the road.<ref name=\"hunter\" />\n\n===Last years and death===\nMoore had to give up playing guitar a few years before his death because of arthritis.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.elvis.com.au/presley/interview-scotty-moore-2013.shtml|title=Arthritis silences notes, but Scotty Moore, Elvis Presley's first guitarist as sharp as ever - Elvis Interviews|website=Elvis.com.au|accessdate=October 6, 2018}}</ref> Quite likely his last appearance on a recording came as a guest on the 2011 album ''61 & 49'' by the Mike Eldred Trio.<ref>[https://www.zohomusic.com/cds/eldred_61%2649.html ZOHO Music website]</ref> That group's leader, guitarist [[Mike Eldred (guitarist)|Mike Eldred]], had been a friend of Moore's since the early 1990s.

Of these men, 399 had contracted syphilis before the study began, and 201 did not have the disease.<ref name=\"timeline\"/> Medical care, hot meals, and free burial insurance were given to those who participated.

He is of Japanese descent, has black hair with red streaks at the end, and has [[Heterochromia iridum|heterochromia]]; his left eye is green and his right eye is violet. He is confident, cheerful, impulsive and gets bored easily. He is skilled at picking any kind of mechanical or electronic lock. The sole exceptions are the shackles on his neck, wrists and ankles which were placed on him mysteriously when he was asleep by a guard with a scar on the back of his neck. His father was inmate number 610 at the Nanba prison and known as the shame of the Nanba prison. He hates the guard who placed the shackles on him, and longs to find him and have them removed. He states that he has to be in Nanba as he has been to all other prisons.

He has a great intuition and is able to make bets on what outcome will occur using his observational skills, luck and intuition. He is kind and outgoing (to the point of being silly) but can be blunt. He is often the one who keeps the others in line when Hajime isn't around, and Nico jokes that he's starting to act like he's their mother. He's also very loyal to Jyugo, whom he claims saved his life and gave him his freedom back. After Jyugo is beaten within an inch of his life by Hajime, he holds a deep anger against Hajime, stating he could never come to like prison guards. He broke out of his previous prisons because he had dates to attend.\n;{{nihongo|Rock|\u30ed\u30c3\u30af|Rokku}}\n:{{voiced by|[[Airu Shiozaki]]<ref name=\"AnimeVA\"/>|Jarrod Greene}}<ref name=\"simuldub\"/>\n:Inmate number 1369.

He can be short tempered and impulsive, but cares for his friends, and mostly remains peaceful and happy.

An American effeminate short male with green hair and bandages on the right side of his body, predominantly on the right side of his face. He has a chain ball shackled to his right leg. He grew up in the slums, where he was a drug mule, and has escaped multiple prisons primarily because they tried to ''inject'' his medicine into him. He is calm at Nanba as the medicine is taken orally and is flavored. Drugs have an unusual effect on him and rather than incapacitate him, they have alternate side effects. He rarely takes anything seriously and is rather childish and happy go lucky. He is a huge anime fan. In the second season, it's revealed why he is so ill and dependent on medication. As a child, a drug gang used him to test their products, which made him develop several unknown illnesses. After being arrested, the doctors at the first prison he was sent to performed painful, invasive medical experiments on him under the guise of trying to help him get better, which only made him more ill. After spending years locked in the prison infirmary, he eventually sunk into a deep depression and wished that he could die, until Jyugo freed him and helped him develop an interest in life again. In episode 21, it's revealed that he has a violent split personality that will emerge if his health problems are not kept under control with his medications, but he is unaware of its existence.\n\n===Nanba Prison guards===\n;{{nihongo|Hajime Sugoroku|\u53cc\u516d \u4e00|Sugoroku Hajime}}\n:{{voiced by|[[Tomokazu Seki]]<ref name=\"AnimeVA\"/>|[[Ian Sinclair (voice actor)|Ian Sinclair]]}}<ref name=\"simuldub\"/>\n:The supervisor of Nanba prison Building 13.

In season 2, it's revealed that he has an older brother, Enki, who was the former supervisor of building 5; Enki was very popular among both the other guards and the prisoners, however, he secretly tortured and abused the inmates in his care, eventually murdering one of them and going on a rampage when his colleagues tried to arrest him. Samon still struggles to comprehend how his brother could do the things he did, and is often taunted by the other guards, who accuse him of being a traitor like his brother was.

He says that he's working with Enki because he wants to see Samon dead, due to how the other guard was chosen as the new building 5 supervisor over him; he considers Samon to be weak and cowardly in comparison to his older brother, and detests having to take orders from him.\n;{{nihongo|Enki Gok\u016b|\u609f\u7a7a \u733f\u9b3c|Gok\u016b Enki}}\n:{{voiced by|[[Takaya Kuroda]] (Japanese); [[Chris Sabat]] (English)<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">{{cite web|url=https://www.funimation.com/blog/2017/01/03/official-winter-2017-simuldub-lineup/|title=Official Winter 2017 SimulDub Lineup - Funimation - Blog!|author=|date=3 January 2017|website=funimation.com|accessdate=6 June 2017}}</ref>}}\n:He has long white and red hair, with a long ponytail which acts like a tail. He has multiple piercings on his left ear and wears a golden choker. He is usually seen with a serious expression. When he was younger, he was usually seen training. He was strong enough to break a boulder in two with a single strike, mediate underwater and even studied diligently. He also was often seen with Samon by his side. According to Liang and Upa, Enki used to be in charge of a prison in China where he cruelly beat up inmates to become stronger. Upa was nearly killed by his abuse and Liang was terrified at the thought that he would be next but Enki was transferred to Nanba Prison. Formerly the supervising officer of Building 5, he was well-respected and admired by the many fellow guards and even inmates throughout Nanba Prison. He was also considered indispensable to Building 5 and Nanba Prison. However, according to Liang and Upa, Enki had continued to cruelly beat up inmates in Nanba Prison which causes inmates to fear Enki. Enki had built an underground prison beneath Building 5, and has a secret archive room which has data on certain dangerous criminals, later discovered by Jyugo, that Enki was aware that Jyugo was part of a human experiment. After betraying his co-workers and killing an inmate, later revealed to be Elf, he was apprehended and arrested by his co-workers. He now resides in the underground prison of Building 5. Some time ago, Enki faced someone with blades similar to Jyugo. The mysterious person managed to injure Enki's left arm and Enki called him a monster. Since then, Enki was searching for him with the intent to kill him, as he believes the man is too dangerous to let live. During the second season, he is released by Inori and Houzuki Sanzou,and the three join forces with Ruka Gojou; another former guard who was arrested, and an incarcerated mob boss named Hachiman, who have all allied themselves with Enki. The five proceed to carry out a plan to capture all of the inmates and supervisors, although it's unknown exactly what Enki's unltimate goal is. While trying to capture the inmates, he sees Jyugo and plans to kill him, as he believes that he is the man with the blades who attacked him.\n;{{nihongo|H\u014dzuki Sanz\u014d|\u4e09\u8535 \u6cd5\u6708|Sanz\u014d H\u014dzuki}}\n:{{voiced by|[[Fuyuka Ooura]] (Japanese); Matt Shipman (English)}}<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n;{{nihongo|Hitoshi Sugoroku|\u53cc\u516d \u4ec1\u5fd7|Sugoroku Hitoshi}}\n:{{voiced by|[[Eishin Fudemura]]<ref name=\"AnimeVA3\"/>}} (Japanese); Howard Wang (English)<ref name=\"funimation.com\"/>\n:Hajime's cute blonde crossdressing brother who befriends Jyugo.

He was found by a movie director, who wanted a real shinobi to cast in her film. She tricked the child into believing that she was his long lost mother, come to take him back, and raised him to be an actor and shinobi. When he discovered the truth he tried to head back to his home village, but got lost and ended up getting arrested for trespassing.

However, when he went to college in [[Germany]], his condition went out of control.  Fellow student Elf took advantage of the situation by framing him for numerous arson crimes in order to make it acceptable for him as a convicted criminal to be used as a test subject.  In an act of rebellion, he burned the lab, but his power was suppressed by the scientist with the scar on his neck, which led to him being sent to Nanba where he finally found someone who believed his story in Kenshiro.

He willingly joined the mob as a young boy to save the life of his teacher, who he witnessed nearly being murdered by the mob for refusing their demands. He was supposed to be an assassin for the boss, but he believed that killing was a sin, and instead used a drug created by Qi to knock his targets out while making them appear to be dead. Eventually he was found out by the boss, who rounded up all the people Liang had spared and forced him to watch them be killed before being brutally tortured himself. When the organization was shut down by the police, he was arrested and sent to jail in China. After a short period there, he was transferred to Nanba. He was severely depressed and disillusioned with martial arts by this time, as his years in the mob had damaged his ideals and left him thinking that he could never be a good person after what he had done. Eventually, he was able to rediscover his passion after Samon Gokuu took him in and began training him.

He stayed and worked for the group willingly, as they had promised to return his organs if he proved useful to them. However, it's revealed in season 2 that the organs he received were not his own, but Qi's, who had had his organs transplanted to Upa after he began dying due to his body shutting down. After he was arrested, he was sent to a prison in China, where he unfortunately became a victim of Enki Gokuu's cruel abuse. However, during this time, he also met Samon Gokuu after the guard was able to put him back in contact with his family, who had been told by the mob boss that he had died. He highly respects Samon because even though the guard claimed that he was just doing his job, he was the first person to show him any sort of kindness or respect in years.

He resides in cell block five with Liang and Upa. He is rather lazy, and can usually be seen relaxing or sleeping in the background, to the point that Liang and Upa often call him \"lazy trash\". He was forced into working for the same people who had took Liang and Upa to save his own life. He initially was unconcerned about the mob's immoral actives, as he was focused on self preservation, but came to hate them after witnessing the boss abusing Liang and Upa. Unbeknownst to Upa, he even gave him some of his own internal organs to save the young boy's life. Eventually, he discovered that his products were being modified to maim and kill the people who used them and, following his arrest, swore that he would never manufacture drugs or poisons again, as he had come to believe that his talents could only hurt other people. During this time, he also lost his ability to trust others. When he was transferred to Nanba prison, however, he eventually was able to take up his trade again after being encouraged by Samon Gokuu. He came to respect Samon for his honesty and kindness, and hopes that he will be able to repay the guard before he is released.\n;{{nihongo|Trois|\u30c8\u30ed\u30ef|Trowa}}\n:{{voiced by|[[Y\u016bto Adachi]]<ref name=\"AnimeVA3\"/>|Elijah Muller<ref name=\"simuldub\"/>}}\n;{{nihongo|Honey|\u30cf\u30cb\u30fc|Han\u012b}}\n:{{voiced by|[[Takao Mitsutomi]]<ref name=\"AnimeVA3\"/>}} (Japanese); Kyle Igneczi (English)<ref name=\"funimation.com\"/>\n;{{nihongo|Ruka Goj\u014d|\u4e94\u6d44 \u6d41\u6cb3|Goj\u014d Ruka}}\n:{{voiced by|[[Naozumi Takahashi]]}} (Japanese); Stephen Fu (English)<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n: Ruka is a former guard, but is now inmate at Nanba Prison Building 5.\n\n===Other characters===\n;{{nihongo|Elf|\u30a8\u30eb\u30d5|Erufu}}\n:{{voiced by|[[Daisuke Kishio]]}}<ref name=\"AnimeVA4\"/> (Japanese); [[Austin Tindle]] (English)<ref name=\"funimation.com\"/>\n:A mysterious character who framed Musashi for a series of arson crimes.\n;Man with the Scar\n:{{voiced by|[[Masanori Ikeda]]}}<ref name=\"AnimeVA4\"/> (Japanese); [[Phil Parsons (voice actor)|Phil Parsons]] (English)<ref name=\"funimation.com\"/>\n:An unknown figure, who is responsible for Jyugo's irremovable shackles, and Musashi's pyrokinesis.

An [[anime]] television series adaptation by [[Satelight]] aired between 5 October 2016 and 22 March 2017. The title is a play on words, combining the name of the prison, which is the Japanese transcription of the word \"number\", and the Japanese word \"[[Baka (Japanese word)|baka]]\" for \"fool\" or \"idiot\".\n\n==Plot==\nThe story centers around four young men who are assigned to Nanba, the world's most formidable prison. Jyugo, who attempted to break out of prison and ended up extending his jail time; Uno, a gambling fanatic who likes women; Rock, who likes eating and fighting; and Nico, an ex drug addict who happens to be an otaku. The action follows the daily lives of the prison's inmates and guards.\n\n==Characters==\n\n===Cell 13===\n;{{nihongo|Jyugo|\u30b8\u30e5\u30fc\u30b4|J\u016bgo}}\n:{{voiced by|[[Y\u016bto Uemura]]<ref name=\"AnimeVA\"/>|Daman Mills}}<ref name=\"simuldub\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.funimation.com/blog/2016/10/18/fall-2016-simuldub-english-cast-announcements-for-the-love-of-dubs/|title=Fall 2016 SimulDub\u2122 English Cast Announcements \u2013 For The Love of Dubs - Funimation \u2013 Blog!|publisher=Funimation|date=18 October 2016|accessdate=27 January 2017}}</ref>\n:Inmate number 1315. He is of Japanese descent, has black hair with red streaks at the end, and has [[Heterochromia iridum|heterochromia]]; his left eye is green and his right eye is violet. He is confident, cheerful, impulsive and gets bored easily. He is skilled at picking any kind of mechanical or electronic lock. The sole exceptions are the shackles on his neck, wrists and ankles which were placed on him mysteriously when he was asleep by a guard with a scar on the back of his neck. His father was inmate number 610 at the Nanba prison and known as the shame of the Nanba prison. He hates the guard who placed the shackles on him, and longs to find him and have them removed. He states that he has to be in Nanba as he has been to all other prisons. His name just means 'fifteen'.\n;{{nihongo|Uno|\u30a6\u30ce}}\n:{{voiced by|[[Tetsuya Kakihara]]<ref name=\"AnimeVA\"/>|Alejandro Saab}}<ref name=\"simuldub\"/>\n:Inmate number 1311. He is of British descent, has a long braid, wears a hat, loves women and gambling, and often has a pair of cards on hand. He has a great intuition and is able to make bets on what outcome will occur using his observational skills, luck and intuition. He is kind and outgoing (to the point of being silly) but can be blunt. He is often the one who keeps the others in line when Hajime isn't around, and Nico jokes that he's starting to act like he's their mother. He's also very loyal to Jyugo, whom he claims saved his life and gave him his freedom back. After Jyugo is beaten within an inch of his life by Hajime, he holds a deep anger against Hajime, stating he could never come to like prison guards. He broke out of his previous prisons because he had dates to attend.\n;{{nihongo|Rock|\u30ed\u30c3\u30af|Rokku}}\n:{{voiced by|[[Airu Shiozaki]]<ref name=\"AnimeVA\"/>|Jarrod Greene}}<ref name=\"simuldub\"/>\n:Inmate number 1369. He is American, has a mohawk, wears long feather earrings, and is the physically largest of his fellow cell mates. He loves fighting and eating and is incredibly strong, with only some of the supervisors being stronger. He can be short tempered and impulsive, but cares for his friends, and mostly remains peaceful and happy. He met Jyugo when the other inmate saved him from starving to death in the first prison he was sent to. He escaped other prisons because the food was terrible, but likes the cooking at Nanba.\n;{{nihongo|Nico|\u30cb\u30b3|Niko}}\n:{{voiced by|[[Daiki Kobayashi]]<ref name=\"AnimeVA\"/>|[[Justin Briner]]}}<ref name=\"simuldub\"/>\n:Inmate 1325. An American effeminate short male with green hair and bandages on the right side of his body, predominantly on the right side of his face. He has a chain ball shackled to his right leg. He grew up in the slums, where he was a drug mule, and has escaped multiple prisons primarily because they tried to ''inject'' his medicine into him. He is calm at Nanba as the medicine is taken orally and is flavored. Drugs have an unusual effect on him and rather than incapacitate him, they have alternate side effects. He rarely takes anything seriously and is rather childish and happy go lucky. He is a huge anime fan. In the second season, it's revealed why he is so ill and dependent on medication. As a child, a drug gang used him to test their products, which made him develop several unknown illnesses. After being arrested, the doctors at the first prison he was sent to performed painful, invasive medical experiments on him under the guise of trying to help him get better, which only made him more ill. After spending years locked in the prison infirmary, he eventually sunk into a deep depression and wished that he could die, until Jyugo freed him and helped him develop an interest in life again. In episode 21, it's revealed that he has a violent split personality that will emerge if his health problems are not kept under control with his medications, but he is unaware of its existence.\n\n===Nanba Prison guards===\n;{{nihongo|Hajime Sugoroku|\u53cc\u516d \u4e00|Sugoroku Hajime}}\n:{{voiced by|[[Tomokazu Seki]]<ref name=\"AnimeVA\"/>|[[Ian Sinclair (voice actor)|Ian Sinclair]]}}<ref name=\"simuldub\"/>\n:The supervisor of Nanba prison Building 13.

In season 2, it's revealed that he has an older brother, Enki, who was the former supervisor of building 5; Enki was very popular among both the other guards and the prisoners, however, he secretly tortured and abused the inmates in his care, eventually murdering one of them and going on a rampage when his colleagues tried to arrest him. Samon still struggles to comprehend how his brother could do the things he did, and is often taunted by the other guards, who accuse him of being a traitor like his brother was.

He has multiple piercings on his left ear and wears a golden choker. He is usually seen with a serious expression. When he was younger, he was usually seen training. He was strong enough to break a boulder in two with a single strike, mediate underwater and even studied diligently. He also was often seen with Samon by his side. According to Liang and Upa, Enki used to be in charge of a prison in China where he cruelly beat up inmates to become stronger. Upa was nearly killed by his abuse and Liang was terrified at the thought that he would be next but Enki was transferred to Nanba Prison. Formerly the supervising officer of Building 5, he was well-respected and admired by the many fellow guards and even inmates throughout Nanba Prison. He was also considered indispensable to Building 5 and Nanba Prison. However, according to Liang and Upa, Enki had continued to cruelly beat up inmates in Nanba Prison which causes inmates to fear Enki. Enki had built an underground prison beneath Building 5, and has a secret archive room which has data on certain dangerous criminals, later discovered by Jyugo, that Enki was aware that Jyugo was part of a human experiment. After betraying his co-workers and killing an inmate, later revealed to be Elf, he was apprehended and arrested by his co-workers. He now resides in the underground prison of Building 5. Some time ago, Enki faced someone with blades similar to Jyugo. The mysterious person managed to injure Enki's left arm and Enki called him a monster. Since then, Enki was searching for him with the intent to kill him, as he believes the man is too dangerous to let live. During the second season, he is released by Inori and Houzuki Sanzou,and the three join forces with Ruka Gojou; another former guard who was arrested, and an incarcerated mob boss named Hachiman, who have all allied themselves with Enki. The five proceed to carry out a plan to capture all of the inmates and supervisors, although it's unknown exactly what Enki's unltimate goal is. While trying to capture the inmates, he sees Jyugo and plans to kill him, as he believes that he is the man with the blades who attacked him.\n;{{nihongo|H\u014dzuki Sanz\u014d|\u4e09\u8535 \u6cd5\u6708|Sanz\u014d H\u014dzuki}}\n:{{voiced by|[[Fuyuka Ooura]] (Japanese); Matt Shipman (English)}}<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n;{{nihongo|Hitoshi Sugoroku|\u53cc\u516d \u4ec1\u5fd7|Sugoroku Hitoshi}}\n:{{voiced by|[[Eishin Fudemura]]<ref name=\"AnimeVA3\"/>}} (Japanese); Howard Wang (English)<ref name=\"funimation.com\"/>\n:Hajime's cute blonde crossdressing brother who befriends Jyugo.

However, Rock has also proven to be able to identify certain emotions on his blank face such as happiness, when they obtained a stone oven for the kitchen.\n;{{nihongo|Okina Otogi|\u5fa1\u5341\u7fa9 \u7fc1|Otogi Okina}}\n:{{voiced by|[[Hiroshi Yanaka]] (Japanese),}}<ref name=\"AnimeVA4\"/> Jeremy Schwartz (English)<ref name=\"simuldub\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.funimation.com/blog/2016/10/18/fall-2016-simuldub-english-cast-announcements-for-the-love-of-dubs/|title=Fall 2016 SimulDub\u2122 English Cast Announcements \u2013 For The Love of Dubs - Funimation \u2013 Blog!|publisher=Funimation|date=18 October 2016|accessdate=27 January 2017}}</ref>\n;{{nihongo|Kazari Otogi|\u5fa1\u5341\u7fa9 \u98fe|Otogi Kazari}}\n:{{voiced by|[[Shizuka Okohira]] (Japanese),}}<ref name=\"AnimeVA4\"/> Linda Leonard (English)<ref name=\"simuldub\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.funimation.com/blog/2016/10/18/fall-2016-simuldub-english-cast-announcements-for-the-love-of-dubs/|title=Fall 2016 SimulDub\u2122 English Cast Announcements \u2013 For The Love of Dubs - Funimation \u2013 Blog!|publisher=Funimation|date=18 October 2016|accessdate=27 January 2017}}</ref>\n\n===Other inmates===\n;{{nihongo|Tsukumo|\u30c4\u30af\u30e2}} \n:{{voiced by|[[Toshiyuki Toyonaga]]<ref name=\"AnimeVA3\">{{cite web|url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2016-08-08/nanbaka-anime-casts-toshiyuki-toyonaga-yoshimasa-hosoya-more/.105133|title=Nanbaka Anime Casts Toshiyuki Toyonaga, Yoshimasa Hosoya, More|date=8 August 2016|website=[[Anime News Network]]|accessdate=8 August 2016}}</ref>}} (Japanese); Sam Biggs (English)<ref name=\"funimation.com\"/>\n:Inmate number 1399. He believes that he is a [[ninja|shinobi]] or [[ninja]], but his techniques usually fail to work. Ironically, he was born in a ninja village, but even as a child he was terrible. He was found by a movie director, who wanted a real shinobi to cast in her film. She tricked the child into believing that she was his long lost mother, come to take him back, and raised him to be an actor and shinobi. When he discovered the truth he tried to head back to his home village, but got lost and ended up getting arrested for trespassing. After escaping the prison, he was recaptured and sent to Nanba.\n;{{nihongo|Musashi|\u30e0\u30b5\u30b7}}\n:{{voiced by|[[Yoshimasa Hosoya]]<ref name=\"AnimeVA3\"/>|[[Jason Liebrecht]]<ref name=\"simuldub\"/>}}\n:Inmate number 4634. He was born with a rare disease that keeps his body temperature much higher than normal and allows him to manifest flames.  He would learn to live and adapt with the disease.  However, when he went to college in [[Germany]], his condition went out of control.  Fellow student Elf took advantage of the situation by framing him for numerous arson crimes in order to make it acceptable for him as a convicted criminal to be used as a test subject.  In an act of rebellion, he burned the lab, but his power was suppressed by the scientist with the scar on his neck, which led to him being sent to Nanba where he finally found someone who believed his story in Kenshiro.  He has since been determined to get revenge against that scientist.\n;{{nihongo|Liang|\u30ea\u30e3\u30f3|Ryan}}\n:{{voiced by|[[Yuuki Fujiwara]]<ref name=\"AnimeVA3\"/>}} (Japanese); [[Blake Shepard]] (English)<ref name=\"funimation.com\"/>\n:Inmate number 0502(block five, number 2), a master martial-artist who can usually be found training. He willingly joined the mob as a young boy to save the life of his teacher, who he witnessed nearly being murdered by the mob for refusing their demands. He was supposed to be an assassin for the boss, but he believed that killing was a sin, and instead used a drug created by Qi to knock his targets out while making them appear to be dead. Eventually he was found out by the boss, who rounded up all the people Liang had spared and forced him to watch them be killed before being brutally tortured himself. When the organization was shut down by the police, he was arrested and sent to jail in China. After a short period there, he was transferred to Nanba. He was severely depressed and disillusioned with martial arts by this time, as his years in the mob had damaged his ideals and left him thinking that he could never be a good person after what he had done. Eventually, he was able to rediscover his passion after Samon Gokuu took him in and began training him. He considers Samon to be his mentor and wants to become stronger so that he can be useful to the guard, who he credits with giving him the will to continue living.\n;{{nihongo|Upa|\u30a6\u30d1}}\n:{{voiced by|[[Y\u016b Kobayashi]]<ref name=\"AnimeVA3\"/>}} (Japanese); [[Aaron Dismuke]] (English)<ref name=\"funimation.com\"/>\n:Upa is a powerful qigong master and has a talismen attached to his head to restrict his chi usage. He was kidnapped by the crime syndicate Liang used to work for when he was a child because as the most prodigious member of a powerful clan, his internal organs were worth a great deal of money on the black market. He stayed and worked for the group willingly, as they had promised to return his organs if he proved useful to them. However, it's revealed in season 2 that the organs he received were not his own, but Qi's, who had had his organs transplanted to Upa after he began dying due to his body shutting down. After he was arrested, he was sent to a prison in China, where he unfortunately became a victim of Enki Gokuu's cruel abuse. However, during this time, he also met Samon Gokuu after the guard was able to put him back in contact with his family, who had been told by the mob boss that he had died. He highly respects Samon because even though the guard claimed that he was just doing his job, he was the first person to show him any sort of kindness or respect in years. His aim is to finish serving out his sentence and attempt to begin a new, better life alongside Liang and Qi.\n;{{nihongo|Qi|\u30c1\u30a3\u30fc|Ch\u012b}}\n:{{voiced by|[[Genki Okawa]]<ref name=\"AnimeVA3\"/>|Gabe Kunda<ref name=\"simuldub\" />}}\n: A prisoner famous for his skill at making drugs and poisons. He resides in cell block five with Liang and Upa. He is rather lazy, and can usually be seen relaxing or sleeping in the background, to the point that Liang and Upa often call him \"lazy trash\". He was forced into working for the same people who had took Liang and Upa to save his own life. He initially was unconcerned about the mob's immoral actives, as he was focused on self preservation, but came to hate them after witnessing the boss abusing Liang and Upa. Unbeknownst to Upa, he even gave him some of his own internal organs to save the young boy's life. Eventually, he discovered that his products were being modified to maim and kill the people who used them and, following his arrest, swore that he would never manufacture drugs or poisons again, as he had come to believe that his talents could only hurt other people. During this time, he also lost his ability to trust others. When he was transferred to Nanba prison, however, he eventually was able to take up his trade again after being encouraged by Samon Gokuu. He came to respect Samon for his honesty and kindness, and hopes that he will be able to repay the guard before he is released.\n;{{nihongo|Trois|\u30c8\u30ed\u30ef|Trowa}}\n:{{voiced by|[[Y\u016bto Adachi]]<ref name=\"AnimeVA3\"/>|Elijah Muller<ref name=\"simuldub\"/>}}\n;{{nihongo|Honey|\u30cf\u30cb\u30fc|Han\u012b}}\n:{{voiced by|[[Takao Mitsutomi]]<ref name=\"AnimeVA3\"/>}} (Japanese); Kyle Igneczi (English)<ref name=\"funimation.com\"/>\n;{{nihongo|Ruka Goj\u014d|\u4e94\u6d44 \u6d41\u6cb3|Goj\u014d Ruka}}\n:{{voiced by|[[Naozumi Takahashi]]}} (Japanese); Stephen Fu (English)<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n: Ruka is a former guard, but is now inmate at Nanba Prison Building 5.\n\n===Other characters===\n;{{nihongo|Elf|\u30a8\u30eb\u30d5|Erufu}}\n:{{voiced by|[[Daisuke Kishio]]}}<ref name=\"AnimeVA4\"/> (Japanese); [[Austin Tindle]] (English)<ref name=\"funimation.com\"/>\n:A mysterious character who framed Musashi for a series of arson crimes.\n;Man with the Scar\n:{{voiced by|[[Masanori Ikeda]]}}<ref name=\"AnimeVA4\"/> (Japanese); [[Phil Parsons (voice actor)|Phil Parsons]] (English)<ref name=\"funimation.com\"/>\n:An unknown figure, who is responsible for Jyugo's irremovable shackles, and Musashi's pyrokinesis.
