Speaking for the host, it is generally called a '''state reception'''. State visits are considered to be the highest expression of friendly [[Bilateralism|bilateral relations]] between two [[sovereign state]]s, and are in general characterised by an emphasis on official public ceremonies.\n\nLess formal visits than a state visit to another country with a lesser emphasis on ceremonial events, by either a head of state or a [[head of government]], can be classified (in descending order of magnitude) as either an '''official visit''', an official working visit, a working visit, a guest of government visit, or a private visit.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/state-and-guest-of-government-visits-april-to-october-2016|title=State and Guest of Government visits - April to October 2016 - Publications - GOV.UK|publisher=}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last1=Moffett|first1=Julie|title=World: How The U.S. Ranks the Visits of Foreign Heads of State|url=http://www.rferl.org/a/1086035.html|accessdate=3 June 2019|publisher=[[Radio Free Europe]]|date=9 August 1997}}</ref>\n\nIn [[parliamentary system|parliamentary democracies]], while heads of state in such systems of government may formally issue and accept invitations, they do so on the [[constitutional advice|advice]] of their [[head of government|heads of government]], who usually decides on when the invitation is to be issued or accepted in advance.\n\n[[Queen Elizabeth II]] is \"the most travelled head of state in the world,\" having made 261 official overseas visits and 96 state visits to 116 countries by the time of her [[Diamond Jubilee of Elizabeth II|Diamond Jubilee]] in 2012.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Campbell|first1=Sophie|title=Queen's Diamond Jubilee: sixty years of royal tours|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/travel/news/Queens-Diamond-Jubilee-sixty-years-of-royal-tours/|accessdate=23 September 2016|work=The Telegraph|issue=Online edition|date=11 May 2012}}</ref> Although she is sovereign of each of the [[Commonwealth realm]]s, in practice, she usually performs full state visits as [[Monarchy of the United Kingdom|Queen of the United Kingdom]], while the relevant [[Governor-general#Modern Commonwealth|governor-general]] undertakes state visits for his or her respective country on the sovereign's behalf. However, the Queen has occasionally made some state and official visits representing one of her other Commonwealth realms.\n\n==Components of a state visit==\n[[File:Rosalynn Carter and Jimmy Carter host state dinner for German Chancellor Helmut Schmidt and Mrs. Helmut Schmidt. - NARA - 175460.tif|thumb|A [[state dinner]] at the [[White House]], held for [[Helmut Schmidt]]. State dinners are a typical component of a state visit.]]\nState visits typically involve some or all the following components (each host country has its own traditions):\n\n* The visiting [[head of state]] is immediately greeted upon arrival by the host (or by a lesser [[official]] representative, if the two heads of state are to meet later at another location) and by his or her [[ambassador]] (or other [[head of mission]]) [[Diplomatic accreditation|accredited to the host country]].\n* A [[21-gun salute]] is fired in honor of the visiting head of state.\n* The playing of the two [[national anthem]]s by a [[military band]]. The guest country's anthem is usually played first.\n* A review of a military [[guard of honour]].\n* The visiting head of state is formally introduced to senior officials/representatives of the host country and the hosting head of state is introduced to the delegation accompanying the visiting head of state.\n* An exchange of gifts between the two heads of state.\n* A [[state dinner]], either [[white tie]] or [[black tie]], is mounted by the hosting head of state, with the visiting head of state being the guest of honor.\n* A visit to the [[legislature]] of the host country, often with the visiting head of state being invited to deliver a formal address to the assembled members of the legislature.\n* High-profile visits by the visiting heads of state to host country [[landmark]]s such as laying a wreath at a military shrine or [[cemetery]].\n* The staging of cultural events celebrating links between the two nations.\n[[File:PGHGermany123.png|thumb|The German presidential standard displayed at the [[President's Guest House]] during a German state visit to the United States. Several countries maintain guest houses used for state visits.]]\nThe visiting head of state is usually accompanied by a senior government minister, usually by a [[foreign minister]]. Behind the [[Protocol (diplomacy)|diplomatic protocol]], delegations made up from [[trade]] organizations also accompany the visiting head of state, offer an opportunity to network and develop economic, cultural, and social links with industry leaders in the nation being visited. At the end of a state visit, the foreign head of state traditionally issues a formal invitation to the head of state of the nation being visited who at another time in the future, would pay a reciprocal state visit.\n\nWhile the costs of a state visit are usually borne by state funds of the host country, most nations host fewer than ten state visits per year, with some as few as two. Most foreign heads of state will stay in the [[official residence]] of the head of state who is hosting the state visit, in a guest house reserved for foreign visitors, or in their own nation's [[Diplomatic mission|embassy]] located in the foreign nation being visited.\n\nState visits by well-known global leaders, such as [[Elizabeth II]], the [[President of the United States]] or the [[Pope]], often draw much publicity and large crowds. Occasionally, these include protesters.\n\n==State visits by country==\n===Armenia===\n{{See also|List of visitors to Tsitsernakaberd}}\nState visits to [[Armenia]] are held in the capital of [[Yerevan]], with a welcoming ceremony usually being held at [[Zvartnots International Airport]].

The first day of the state visit traditionally comes to a close with a state banquet at the [[Castle of Laeken]], which is the official residence of the King of the Belgians.\n\nIt is customary to be awarded the Knight Grand Cross of the [[Order of Leopold (Belgium)|Order of Leopold]] during state visits.\n\n===Canada===\n{{See also|List of state and official visits by Canada}}\n[[File:Sergio Mattarella al Rideau Hall 09.jpg|thumb|The [[Governor General's Foot Guards]] typically mounts the [[guard of honour]] during state visits to Canada, here during the visit of Italian president [[Sergio Mattarella]].]]\nThe [[Governor General's Foot Guards]], one of two [[Household Division|household]] [[Foot Guards]], take part in state and official visits to [[Ottawa]].

Additionally, because the Canadian sovereign is shared with 15 other [[Commonwealth realms]], state visits are not conducted between Canada and the other Commonwealth realms, with official visits performed by the realms' respective [[governor-general]], or [[prime minister]].\n\n===China, People's Republic of===\n[[File:Vladimir Putin awarded the Chinese Order of Friendship 07.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Beijing Garrison Honor Guard Battalion|Beijing Garrison Honor Guard]] with the [[Order of Friendship (China)|Order of Friendship]], an award occasionally given during state visits.]]\nState arrival ceremonies in [[China]] take place at the East Court of the [[Great Hall of the People]] on [[Tiananmen Square]] in [[Beijing]].

After the band finishes its performance, the two leaders then inspect the guard of honour at the invitation of the guard commander. Following the inspection, both leaders embrace schoolchildren who wave flowers and the flags of both countries. At this time, the band performs a military march or folk song from the guest country. If a Prime Minister or Chancellor or Crown Prince visits China, the welcoming ceremony is held by the Premier. If a President, Governor-General or King visits, the welcoming ceremony is held by the President. \n\nThe People's Liberation Army (PLA) Honor Guard then marches off the square to the tune of the [[Military Anthem of the People's Liberation Army|March of the Chinese People's Liberation Army]].

Depending on the status of the guest, state ceremonies are either held at the [[Bellevue Palace (Germany)|Bellevue Palace]] or the [[Federal Chancellery (Berlin)|Federal Chancellery Complex]]. In recent years, state visits have been marked with dignitaries paying homage at memorials such as the [[Berlin Victory Column]], the [[Memorial to the Murdered Jews of Europe]], and the [[Soviet War Memorial (Tiergarten)]]. \n\nDuring state visits, foreign dignitaries typically visit German federal states outside the capital. It this regard, a full honors ceremony is also held with the minister-president being the presiding officer.<ref>https://www.historisches-lexikon-bayerns.de/Lexikon/Staatsbesuche_(nach_1945)</ref><ref>http://www.bundespraesident.de/DE/Amt-und-Aufgaben/Wirken-im-Ausland/Staatsbesuche/staatsbesuche-node.html</ref> In break with the traditional [[Berlin]] military protocol, chairs have since July 2019 been set up outside the Chancellery due to Chancellor [[Angela Merkel]]'s unusual episodes of shaking and uneasiness during the honours ceremony.

Arrival honors for foreign dignitaries visiting [[Rome]] are held either at the [[Quirinal Palace]] (official residence of the President of the Italian Republic) or the [[Palazzo Chigi]] (official residence of the Prime Minister of the Italian Republic). During the ceremony, the guard of honor is provided by a military unit (most likely the [[Corazzieri]] and a selected ceremonial unit such as the Honour Company \"Goito\" from the 1\u00b0 Regiment \"Granatieri di Sardegna\") and a supporting military band that performs 3 [[Ruffles and flourishes]] known as \"Onori\" (\"Honors\") prior to playing the national anthem of the dignitary's home country and [[Il Canto degli Italiani]]. In recent years, the [[Bersaglieri]], the [[Carabinieri]], and the [[Italian Navy]] have provided honor guards for the ceremony. \n\nThe rest of the day includes bilateral meetings, one on one conversations, a joint press conference, and a state dinner, where the exchange of gifts and the awarding of honors takes place.

Upon arrival to the country, the dignitary will be given a tour through the capital, which includes a wreath-laying ceremony at the [[National Monument (Amsterdam)|National Monument]]. Foreign dignitaries are usually received by the monarch at the [[Royal Palace of Amsterdam]], where they receive a guard of honour formed by the [[Grenadiers' and Rifles Guard Regiment]] upon arrival. It is here where all matters of state and bilateral meetings take place over the course of the visit.\n\nDuring a state visit, the [[Dutch monarch]] always hosts a [[state dinner]] in honor of the guest, usually at the monarch's residence at the [[Noordeinde Palace]]. It is customary to be awarded the Knight Grand Cross [[Order of the Netherlands Lion]] during state visits.\n\n===North Korea===\nAlthough state visits to [[North Korea]] do not happen often, they are held to the highest standard when they occur.

As the dignitary arrives, units of the [[Spanish Royal Guard]] (including the Mounted Band of Timpani and Bugles and the Lancers Troop) prepares for the start of the arrival ceremony. The ceremony starts with all units [[presenting arms]] at the sound of a bugle call and performing a royal salute, with the playing of the guest anthem and the ''[[Marcha Real]]'' taking place. Once the regiment is orders arms, 3 senior officers from the guard (a senior commander, a bugler and a guidon bearer) approach the central grandstand to report to the guest and His Majesty the king on the readiness of the regiment for inspection.

During the course of the visit, the visiting leader may deliver an address to a joint session of the bicameral [[Cortes Generales]] (composed of the [[Senate of Spain|Senate]] and the [[Congress of Deputies]]).\n\n===United Arab Emirates===\nThe [[United Arab Emirates Air Force]] does a flyover while painting the sky in the colors of the visiting country's flag as the leader's car arrives at the [[Qasr Al Watan|Presidential palace]] with an Army mounted escort. Upon arrival, he/she is greeted by the [[President of the UAE]] and/or Deputy Supreme Commander of the [[United Arab Emirates Armed Forces]], where they both receive [[military honors]] from the [[UAE Presidential Guard]] as well as a [[21-gun salute]] from members of the Army. While inside the palace they are also greeted by children holding UAE flags as well as flags of the visiting country. The entire city of [[Abu Dhabi]] is usually decorated for the visit, with flags being laid out in the streets and large pictures of the leaders of the visiting country and the UAE being put on large buildings. During the visit of [[Vladimir Putin]] in October 2019, police cars were sprayed with the [[Cyrillic]] letters \"\u0414\u041f\u0421\", which stands for the \"\u0414\u043e\u0440\u043e\u0436\u043d\u043e-\u043f\u0430\u0442\u0440\u0443\u043b\u044c\u043d\u0430\u044f \u0441\u043b\u0443\u0436\u0431\u0430\" ({{Lang-en|Roads Patrol Service}}).<ref>https://m.gazeta.ru/politics/2019/10/17_a_12760394.shtml</ref><ref>https://ria.ru/amp/20191016/1559845273.html</ref>\n\n===United Kingdom===\n{{Main|State and official visits to the United Kingdom}}\n[[File:Prime Minister David Cameron with H.E.

An arrival ceremony usually takes place on [[Horse Guards Parade]] (There are also some instances where it takes place at [[Buckingham Palace]] or [[Windsor Castle]]) with a Guard of Honour being provided by members of the [[Queen's Guard]]. The guard of honour will always report to the dignitary in the language of the visitor, with the report being along the lines of the following:\n\n::'\"Your Excellency, the guard of honour, provided by the (states name of unit), is formed up, and ready for inspection.\"'' \n\nDepending on the area where the ceremony takes place, a march past will immediately take place following the inspection. The foreign guest and the Queen then travel to Buckingham Palace in a carriage procession escorted by a large number of mounted soldiers from the Household Cavalry. The welcome ceremony is accompanied by 21-gun salutes fired from [[Green Park]] and the [[Tower of London]]. Around 150 guests are invited to Buckingham Palace for the state banquet in the evening in the ballroom.<ref name=\"royal\">{{cite web|url=https://www.royal.uk/state-visits-2|title=State Visits &#124; The Royal Family|website=royal.uk|accessdate=25 September 2018}}</ref><ref name=\"changing-guard\">{{cite web|url=https://changing-guard.com/ceremonial/state-visits.html|title=Changing the Guard &#124; Ceremonial Events / State Visits|website=changing-guard.com|accessdate=25 September 2018}}</ref> \n\nState visits do not formally occur between the United Kingdom and the 15 other Commonwealth realms, as the realms all share a common monarch and head of state.

These extensions are planned in a six-phase framework. The first (and current) phase allowed the airport to accommodate 26 million passengers per year. When the airport originally opened, the current phase called for a capacity of only 16 million passengers per year; however, the capacity was able to increase without progressing to the next phase thanks to advanced IT logistics.<ref name=\"ACI1\">{{cite journal|last=Bates|first=Joe|title=Positive Thinking|journal=Airport World|publisher=Airports Council International \u2013 aci.aero|volume=14|issue=1|url=http://www.aia.gr/UserFiles/File/Press/ClippingsEn/2009/Airport_World_CEO_Y_Paraschis_Positive_Thinking.pdf}}</ref> The sixth and final expansion phase will allow the airport to accommodate an annual traffic of 50 million passengers, with the current layout leaving enough space for five more terminals to be added.<ref name=\"AW2010\" /> As such, the parallel runway system currently in place has been designed to accommodate flight traffic with this high equivalent annual passenger load upon completion of the final expansion phase.<ref name=\"ACI1\" />\n\n=== Main Terminal ===\nThe main terminal building handles all intra-[[Schengen Area|Schengen]] flights, as well as several non-Schengen flights. All of the airport's 144 check-in desks are located in the Main Terminal and it has three separate levels, one for arrivals, one for departures and a food court level complete with a view of the eastern runway. Finally, the terminal is equipped with fourteen [[jet bridge]]s and eleven belt conveyors for luggage.\n\n* '''Hall A''' is used for flights to Non-schengen countries and Non-European countries.\n* '''Hall B''' handles flights to Intra-schengen countries as well as domestic services.\n\nIn March 2018, the Athens International Airport issued a tender for its first physical expansion, concerning the south wings of the main terminal.<ref>{{cite web|title=AIA \"El.Venizelos\" Current Tenders|url=https://www.aia.gr/company-and-business/business/current-tenders/ |website=aia.gr|accessdate=22 March 2018}}</ref> The tender called for a building expansion with a total area of approximately 14,950 square meters over five levels (levels 0 to 4). The construction company to build the expansion has been awarded in summer 2018 and the project is scheduled to be completed by mid-2019. It will add 18 more counter check-in decks as well as additional space for arrivals, departures, security and automated control gates, it will also add expanded shopping area and new lounges by mid-2020.\n\n=== Satellite Terminal ===\nThe satellite terminal has two levels, one for arrivals and the other for departures.<ref name=\"ACI1\" /> It is easily accessible through an underground link complete with moving walkways. The terminal is equipped with ten jet bridges and is capable of handling annual traffic of six million passengers.\n\nIn recent years its parking stands were utilized for long term storage of airliners, specifically two ex-[[Olympic Airways]] [[Airbus 340|Airbus A340-300s]] (both aircraft were transferred to its new owner in February 2017)<ref name=\"A340removal\">[http://www.aerotelegraph.com/untaetige-airbus-a340-verlassen-athen aerotelegraph.com \u2013 \"Unused Airbus A340s leave Athens\"] (German) 18 February 2017</ref> and a [[Boeing 767]]-300ER of defunct Greek start-up carrier [[SkyGreece Airlines]].

These extensions are planned in a six-phase framework. The first (and current) phase allowed the airport to accommodate 26 million passengers per year. When the airport originally opened, the current phase called for a capacity of only 16 million passengers per year; however, the capacity was able to increase without progressing to the next phase thanks to advanced IT logistics.<ref name=\"ACI1\">{{cite journal|last=Bates|first=Joe|title=Positive Thinking|journal=Airport World|publisher=Airports Council International \u2013 aci.aero|volume=14|issue=1|url=http://www.aia.gr/UserFiles/File/Press/ClippingsEn/2009/Airport_World_CEO_Y_Paraschis_Positive_Thinking.pdf}}</ref> The sixth and final expansion phase will allow the airport to accommodate an annual traffic of 50 million passengers, with the current layout leaving enough space for five more terminals to be added.<ref name=\"AW2010\" /> As such, the parallel runway system currently in place has been designed to accommodate flight traffic with this high equivalent annual passenger load upon completion of the final expansion phase.<ref name=\"ACI1\" />\n\n=== Main Terminal ===\nThe main terminal building handles all intra-[[Schengen Area|Schengen]] flights, as well as several non-Schengen flights. All of the airport's 144 check-in desks are located in the Main Terminal and it has three separate levels, one for arrivals, one for departures and a food court level complete with a view of the eastern runway. Finally, the terminal is equipped with fourteen [[jet bridge]]s and eleven belt conveyors for luggage.\n\n* '''Hall A''' is used for flights to Non-schengen countries and Non-European countries.\n* '''Hall B''' handles flights to Intra-schengen countries as well as domestic services.\n\nIn March 2018, the Athens International Airport issued a tender for its first physical expansion, concerning the south wings of the main terminal.<ref>{{cite web|title=AIA \"El.Venizelos\" Current Tenders|url=https://www.aia.gr/company-and-business/business/current-tenders/ |website=aia.gr|accessdate=22 March 2018}}</ref> The tender called for a building expansion with a total area of approximately 14,950 square meters over five levels (levels 0 to 4). The construction company to build the expansion has been awarded in summer 2018 and the project is scheduled to be completed by mid-2019. It will add 18 more counter check-in decks as well as additional space for arrivals, departures, security and automated control gates, it will also add expanded shopping area and new lounges by mid-2020.\n\n=== Satellite Terminal ===\nThe satellite terminal has two levels, one for arrivals and the other for departures.<ref name=\"ACI1\" /> It is easily accessible through an underground link complete with moving walkways. The terminal is equipped with ten jet bridges and is capable of handling annual traffic of six million passengers.\n\nIn recent years its parking stands were utilized for long term storage of airliners, specifically two ex-[[Olympic Airways]] [[Airbus 340|Airbus A340-300s]] (both aircraft were transferred to its new owner in February 2017)<ref name=\"A340removal\">[http://www.aerotelegraph.com/untaetige-airbus-a340-verlassen-athen aerotelegraph.com \u2013 \"Unused Airbus A340s leave Athens\"] (German) 18 February 2017</ref> and a [[Boeing 767]]-300ER of defunct Greek start-up carrier [[SkyGreece Airlines]]. However, as of June 2017, the parking space of the satellite terminal is in full use for both Schengen and non-Schengen area flights and to accommodate increased traffic. From June 2017 some low-cost carriers were using it. On 24 May 2018, the Satellite Terminal officially restarted full operations.
