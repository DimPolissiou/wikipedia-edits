Operated by Portland Streetcar, Inc. and [[TriMet]], it consists of two distinct services: the {{convert|6.1|mi|km|1|adj=on}} '''A Loop''', which runs [[clockwise]], and the {{convert|6.6|mi|km|1|adj=on}} '''B Loop''', which runs counterclockwise. Each service travels a loop on both sides of the [[Willamette River]], crossing the river on the [[Broadway Bridge (Portland)|Broadway Bridge]] in the north and [[Tilikum Crossing]] in the south. The route connects Portland's [[Downtown Portland, Oregon|downtown]], [[Pearl District, Portland, Oregon|Pearl District]], [[Lloyd District, Portland, Oregon|Lloyd District]], [[Central Eastside, Portland, Oregon|Central Eastside]], and [[South Waterfront, Portland, Oregon|South Waterfront]]. It serves the city's various landmarks and institutions, including the [[Rose Quarter, Portland, Oregon|Rose Quarter]], the [[Oregon Convention Center]], the [[Oregon Museum of Science and Industry]] (OMSI), [[Oregon Health and Science University]] (OHSU), and [[Portland State University]] (PSU).\n\nPortland city officials first proposed building an eastside streetcar line in 1997, at the same time the city council authorized the construction of the Portland's [[NS Line|first modern streetcar line]] on the west side. After several years of planning, the city council approved the Eastside Loop extension in 2008 and the line's groundbreaking was held the following year. The extension's first {{convert|3.3|mi|km}} opened between the Broadway Bridge and OMSI on September 22, 2012. It was inaugurated by the '''Central Loop Line''' ('''CL Line''') service, which ran an additional {{convert|1.1|mi|km}} alongside the NS Line on 10th and 11th avenues. The CL Line re-branded in 2015 during the opening of Tilikum Crossing, which completed the streetcar loop with a southerly river crossing extension from OMSI to the South Waterfront.\n\n==History==\n===Planning===\n[[File:Broadway Bridge west end.jpg|thumb|left|The Broadway Bridge in 2009, prior to the installation of streetcar tracks]]\n\nPlans to expand the Portland Streetcar east of the [[Willamette River]] emerged in July 1997, at the same time the [[Government of Portland, Oregon|Portland City Council]] authorized the construction of the system's [[NS Line|first line]] on the west side between [[Northwest District, Portland, Oregon|Northwest Portland]] and [[Portland State University|PSU]].

system. Operated by Portland Streetcar, Inc. and [[TriMet]], it consists of two distinct services: the {{convert|6.1|mi|km|1|adj=on}} '''A Loop''', which runs [[clockwise]], and the {{convert|6.6|mi|km|1|adj=on}} '''B Loop''', which runs counterclockwise. Each service travels a loop on both sides of the [[Willamette River]], crossing the river on the [[Broadway Bridge (Portland)|Broadway Bridge]] in the north and [[Tilikum Crossing]] in the south. The route connects Portland's [[Downtown Portland, Oregon|downtown]], [[Pearl District, Portland, Oregon|Pearl District]], [[Lloyd District, Portland, Oregon|Lloyd District]], [[Central Eastside, Portland, Oregon|Central Eastside]], and [[South Waterfront, Portland, Oregon|South Waterfront]]. It serves the city's various landmarks and institutions, including the [[Rose Quarter, Portland, Oregon|Rose Quarter]], the [[Oregon Convention Center]], the [[Oregon Museum of Science and Industry]] (OMSI), [[Oregon Health and Science University]] (OHSU), and [[Portland State University]] (PSU).\n\nPortland city officials first proposed building an eastside streetcar line in 1997, at the same time the city council authorized the construction of the Portland's [[NS Line|first modern streetcar line]] on the west side. After several years of planning, the city council approved the Eastside Loop extension in 2008 and the line's groundbreaking was held the following year. The extension's first {{convert|3.3|mi|km}} opened between the Broadway Bridge and OMSI on September 22, 2012. It was inaugurated by the '''Central Loop Line''' ('''CL Line''') service, which ran an additional {{convert|1.1|mi|km}} alongside the NS Line on 10th and 11th avenues. The CL Line re-branded in 2015 during the opening of Tilikum Crossing, which completed the streetcar loop with a southerly river crossing extension from OMSI to the South Waterfront.\n\n==History==\n===Planning===\n[[File:Broadway Bridge west end.jpg|thumb|left|The Broadway Bridge in 2009, prior to the installation of streetcar tracks]]\n\nPlans to expand the Portland Streetcar east of the [[Willamette River]] emerged in July 1997, at the same time the [[Government of Portland, Oregon|Portland City Council]] authorized the construction of the system's [[NS Line|first line]] on the west side between [[Northwest District, Portland, Oregon|Northwest Portland]] and [[Portland State University|PSU]].

Fars\u00f8 was the birthplace of [[Johannes Vilhelm Jensen]], winner of the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1944. The village of [[Vognsild]] is located to the west of Fars\u00f8.

The Deity symbolizes both the [[masculinity|masculine]] and [[Femininity|feminine]] principles.

King describes ''nyama'' in the following terms:\n:{{cquote|''During the 1960s, nommo was defined by black cultural scholars and [[African studies|Africanist]]s as the spiritual-physical energy of \"the word\" that conjures being through naming.  It is the seed of word, water, and life in one that brings to the body its vital human force called the nyama. Nommo controls the nyama by naming and unnaming it\u2014calling it forth. A \"body\" existence without the liberated life force of the nyama (what I call the \"flesh\") is worst than dead. It is dehumanized.''<ref>King, Debra Walker,  ''Deep Talk: Reading African-American Literary Names'', [[University of Virginia Press]] (1998), p. 37, {{ISBN|9780813918525}}</ref>}}\n\nThe Dogon attributes the origins of masks to beings they refer to as ''Andoumboulou''. The first masks were made of fiber. Although women eventually acquired them, and later men, their function was not apparent to the Dogon until the ancestors started dying. The first ancestor to suffer death did so in the form of a [[snake]]. As common in other [[Traditional African religions|African beliefs]] and cosmogonies such as in  the [[Serer creation myth|Serer myth]], a serpent death represents the  process of transforming into spirit form. When people realzed the negative effects of the ''nyama'' released by death, the ancestors decided to carve a mask so that it serves as a support for the ''nyama''. The mask was carved in the form of a snake symbolizing the dead ancestor. That initial mask, called \"imina na\" in the [[Dogon language|Dongon languages]] (\"great mask\" or \"mother of masks\") is the style of mask used in the ''Sigi'' ceremony in order to commemorate this mythic event every sixty years.<ref name=\"Ezra\"/>\n\nAlthough the face of the mask is in snake form, it is never worn. Instead, the Dogon would display it in a stationary position or while carrying it.\nEvery sixty years during the Sigi ceremony, each Dogon village will make a new \"great mask\".  Following the initial death which prompted the production of the \"great mask\", other deaths followed, and soon after, the Dogon had to seek other measures to deal with the released ''nyama''.  \nInitially, the Dogon erected alters for the ancestors while wood figures served as repository for the spiritual forces. As deaths increased, that became insufficient and masks were then made for ''dama'' rituals. The ''dama'' is a ritual where the souls of the dead are escorted out of the village and sent to the afterlife permanently. The Dogon have many rituals about death which are important elements of their mask culture.<ref name=\"Ezra\"/>\n\nA four set of masks called ''bede'', and a carved wooden mask called ''sirige'' are usually put on for the ''baga bundo''ritual\u2014which is a type of dance  held two days after the burial of a man who had participated in a Sigi ceremony. After several years since the passing of the deceased, the ''dama'' ritual is performed. The ''dama'' last for six days. Its purpose is to raise the prestige and reputation of the deceased and that of his descendants. A lot of time and resources goes towards the preparation of the ''dama''. It is a very elaborate and costly ritual. During the ''dama'' ritual, the Mask Society (the [[Awa Society]]) performs in the village plaza, at the deceased's house and in the [[Hogon]]'s sacred fields.<ref name=\"Ezra\"/>\n\nThe soul of the dead, which had been localized in the handle of his hoe and in a container of millet beer is then removed from the village\u2014throwned into the bush. Where the ''dama'' ritual is performed for a deceased woman, it is not accompanied by mask dancing unless the deceased female was a ''yasigine''\u2014the sole member of the Mask Society.<ref name=\"Ezra\"/>\n\nThere are many different types of Dogon masks, some of which represent mammals, reptiles, birds, humans, objects, and abstract concepts. Masks \"may be seen as a summary of the people, animal, and things that constitute the Dogon world, a visual accounting of the return to order in the universe following the disruption caused by death.\"<ref name=\"Ezra\">Ezra, Kate, ''Art of the Dogon: Selections from the Lester Wunderman Collection'', [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]] (1988), pp. 23\u201325, {{ISBN|9780810918740}} (retrieved March 3, 2020) [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=YdNhUppxc6kC&pg=PA23#v=onepage&q&f=false]</ref>\n\nLike many traditional African religions, the Abrahamic religious concept of [[heaven]] and [[hell]] does not exist in Dogon religion. Ancestor veneration is however an important element. [[Sculpture]]s and masks are normally made by Dogon [[blacksmith]]s, who also work [[iron]]. There are two types of smiths in Dogon society: the ''jemo'' who lives on the plains, and the ''iru'' who live on the plateau.<ref name=\"Ezra\"/><ref>[[Denise Paulme|Paulme, Denise]] .''Organisation sociale des Dogon (Soudan fran\u00e7ais)'', F.

Both the ''jemo'' and ''iru'' serve as [[Intercession|intermediaries]] and peacemakers between other Dogons, between the living and the ancestors, and between mankind and Amma, especially on rituals surrounding [[Rainmaking (ritual)|rainmaking]].  The respect accorded to blacksmiths derives from their role in the creation myth, in which the first blacksmith is said to have descended from the [[Empyrean |Empyrean Heaven]] in order to bring mankind fire, iron, and seeds for cultivation.<ref name=\"Ezra p. 25\">Ezra, Kate, ''Art of the Dogon: Selections from the Lester Wunderman Collection'', p. 25,</ref><ref>Griaule, Marcel, ''Masques Dogons'', Volume 33, Institut d'Ethnologie (1938), pp. 48\u201451</ref>\n\nAs with their rites associated with [[Reproduction|procreation]] during [[life]], the image of humanity developing in its [[placenta]] is also present in their [[funeral]] rites. When a person dies, their mouth is covered with a muzzle. This ritual symbolizes the wattles of fish. The dead's head is covered with a white band circling the top of his skull. This symbolizes the top of the fish's head. As they send the deceased to the next life, women and girls perform ritual dances mimicking a fish\u2014with their arms and hands streched out in front of them\u2014symbolizing the swimming of fish. These movements are very suppley done. \"The assimilations go on because a dead person who continues to preserve his spirtual elements (that is, his basic elements) until the afterlife is said to be like \"a fish of heaven.\"<ref name=\"Bonnefoy\"/>\n\n==Ancestral spirits==\n{{main|Nommo}}\nThe '''Nommo''' are [[Veneration of the dead|ancestral spirits]] (sometimes referred to as deities) venerated  by the Dogon. The word Nommos is derived from the [[Dogon language]] meaning \"to make one drink.\" The Nommos are usually described as amphibious, [[hermaphrodite|hermaphroditic]], fish-like creatures. Folk art depictions of the Nommos show creatures with [[humanoid]] upper torsos, legs/feet, and a fish-like lower torso and tail. The Nommos are also referred to as \u201cMasters of the Water\u201d, \u201cthe Monitors\u201d, and \"The Teachers\u201d. According to Dogon cosmogony, in primodial time, the Nommo \"could not live entirely on land and on their arrival they made a reservoir of water and dived into it.\"<ref>[[Vivianne Crowley|Crowley, Vivianne]]; Crowley, Christopher; [[Carlton Publishing Group|Carlton Books, Limited]] (2002), p. 195, {{ISBN|9781858689876}}</ref>\n\n==Priesthood==\n{{main|Hogon}}\nThe Dogon's spiritual leader is called [[hogon]]. \nAccording to Dogon cosmogony, there were four pairs of twins, four females and four males. They were ancestors of humans. Of these, Griaule M. (1970, p.&nbsp;223) refer to the seventh as \"The Master of Speech\"\u2014alluding to its \"masculine\" characteristics. In the Dogon tradition, the seventh ancestor's gift to humankind included weaving, music, dress and language.<ref>Griaule, M., ''Conversations with Ogotemm\u00eali'' (1970, p. 223) [in] Tally, Justine, ''Toni Morrison's 'Beloved': Origins'', [[Routledge]] (2008), p. 122, {{ISBN|9781134361311}} (retrieved March 3, 2020) [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=BPp-AgAAQBAJ&pg=PA122#v=onepage&q&f=false]</ref>\n\nDorey posits that, [[She (pronoun)|the pronoun \"she\"]] (not [[He (pronoun)|\"he\"]]), and the \"Mistress of Speech\", not \"the Master of Speech\" should have been used by Griaule.<ref name=\"Sha Dor she not he\"/> She went on to write: \n:''Seventh ancestor and seventh Nummo, born in the second \"word\" or second experiment\". The Mistress of Speech was immortal and androgynous, but primarily female, and was seen as the perfect combination of Nummo and human. The DNA of the Mistress of Speech was the hope for the world. The Mistress of Speech was associated with weaving. On the Nummo's world, the seventh ancestor could only mate with the second ancestor, who was connected with the evil genetic material and the jackal.

Her twenty-two articulations are supposed to represent her twenty-two body parts and \"the evolutionary changes that would occur in humans as a result of her death and resurrection.\" For this reason, each candidate for Dogon priesthood must undergo twenty-two trances, or \"attacks\" called ''soy'' (quaking spells) in Dogon.  Each of these trances corresponds to the Mistress of Speech's body, \"Word\" or DNA. The word ''soy'' also mean seven in Dogon, and thus refer to the \"Sevent Ancestor\", who was the Mistress of Speech.<ref name=\"Day of the Fish by Dorey\">Dorey, Shannon, ''Day of the Fish: The First Religion'' (Volume 3 of Dogon Religion), Elemental Expressions Ltd.

It is mainly about communicating the revelation of speech to men, a ceremony of atonement and initiation, and a way of demanding pardon for the death of an ancestor after the folly and forgetfulness of some young men. It is a long procession that starts and ends in the village of [[Youga Dogorou]]. The Sigi festival is one of the most well known and anticipated Dogon festivals, and perhaps the most important of all the Dogon rituals.  The Sigi occurs once every sixty years in  the Dogon calendar\u2014determined by the position of the star [[Sirius]] in the [[night sky]]. A person may only live to witness one Sigi festival, or two if they are lucky to live long enough. The 60-year interval is so precise it has baffled some scholars such as anthropologist and  filmmaker [[Jean Rouch]]\u2014many of [[Jean Rouch#Main films|whose works]] are about the subject. The 60-years interval also corresponds to the life span of the mystic Dogon ancestor. Every five days, the Dogon would tie a knot on a rope. This constitutes the Dogon week. In so doing, they are able to celebrate the Sigi with such precision. The last 4 Sigi celebrations occurred in 1787, 1847, 1907, and 1967. The next one will be in the year 2027 (as of 2020).<ref name=\"Adjaye\">Adjaye, Joseph K., ''Time in the Black Experience'' (Issue 167 of Contributions in Afro-American and African studies, {{ISSN|0069-9624}}), [[Greenwood Publishing Group]] (1994), p. 92, {{ISBN|9780313291180}} (retrieved March 3, 2020) [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=PQMlpbxkp_MC&pg=PA92#v=onepage&q&f=false]</ref><ref>Velton, Ross, ''Mali: The Bradt Safari Guide'', [[Bradt Travel Guides]] (2009), p. 192, {{ISBN|9781841622187}} (retrieved March 13, 2020) [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=t8xB7ZG2KOEC&pg=PA192#v=onepage&q&f=false]</ref><ref name=\"Bonnefoy\">Editor: Bonnefoy, Yves; (translated by: Doniger, Wendy ; compiled by: Bonnefoy, Yves),  ''American, African, and Old European Mythologies'', University of Chicago Press (1993), p. 124, {{ISBN|9780226064574}} (retrieved March 3, 2020) [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=GYjc5POwJjAC&pg=PA124#v=onepage&q&f=false]</ref><ref group=note>Guiness World Records gave 2032 as the next Sigui ceremony.

King describes ''nyama'' in the following terms:\n:{{cquote|''During the 1960s, nommo was defined by black cultural scholars and [[African studies|Africanist]]s as the spiritual-physical energy of \"the word\" that conjures being through naming.  It is the seed of word, water, and life in one that brings to the body its vital human force called the nyama. Nommo controls the nyama by naming and unnaming it\u2014calling it forth. A \"body\" existence without the liberated life force of the nyama (what I call the \"flesh\") is worst than dead. It is dehumanized.''<ref>King, Debra Walker,  ''Deep Talk: Reading African-American Literary Names'', [[University of Virginia Press]] (1998), p. 37, {{ISBN|9780813918525}}</ref>}}\n\nThe Dogon attributes the origins of masks to beings they refer to as ''Andoumboulou''. The first masks were made of fiber. Although women eventually acquired them, and later men, their function was not apparent to the Dogon until the ancestors started dying. The first ancestor to suffer death did so in the form of a [[snake]]. As common in other [[Traditional African religions|African beliefs]] and cosmogonies such as in  the [[Serer creation myth|Serer myth]], a serpent death represents the  process of transforming into spirit form. When people realzed the negative effects of the ''nyama'' released by death, the ancestors decided to carve a mask so that it serves as a support for the ''nyama''. The mask was carved in the form of a snake symbolizing the dead ancestor. That initial mask, called \"imina na\" in the [[Dogon language|Dongon languages]] (\"great mask\" or \"mother of masks\") is the style of mask used in the ''Sigi'' ceremony in order to commemorate this mythic event every sixty years.<ref name=\"Ezra\"/>\n\nAlthough the face of the mask is in snake form, it is never worn. Instead, the Dogon would display it in a stationary position or while carrying it.\nEvery sixty years during the Sigi ceremony, each Dogon village will make a new \"great mask\".  Following the initial death which prompted the production of the \"great mask\", other deaths followed, and soon after, the Dogon had to seek other measures to deal with the released ''nyama''.  \nInitially, the Dogon erected alters for the ancestors while wood figures served as repository for the spiritual forces. As deaths increased, that became insufficient and masks were then made for ''dama'' rituals. The ''dama'' is a ritual where the souls of the dead are escorted out of the village and sent to the afterlife permanently. The Dogon have many rituals about death which are important elements of their mask culture.<ref name=\"Ezra\"/>\n\nA four set of masks called ''bede'', and a carved wooden mask called ''sirige'' are usually put on for the ''baga bundo''ritual\u2014which is a type of dance  held two days after the burial of a man who had participated in a Sigi ceremony. After several years since the passing of the deceased, the ''dama'' ritual is performed. The ''dama'' last for six days. Its purpose is to raise the prestige and reputation of the deceased and that of his descendants. A lot of time and resources goes towards the preparation of the ''dama''. It is a very elaborate and costly ritual. During the ''dama'' ritual, the Mask Society (the [[Awa Society]]) performs in the village plaza, at the deceased's house and in the [[Hogon]]'s sacred fields.<ref name=\"Ezra\"/>\n\nThe soul of the dead, which had been localized in the handle of his hoe and in a container of millet beer is then removed from the village\u2014throwned into the bush. Where the ''dama'' ritual is performed for a deceased woman, it is not accompanied by mask dancing unless the deceased female was a ''yasigine''\u2014the sole member of the Mask Society.<ref name=\"Ezra\"/>\n\nThere are many different types of Dogon masks, some of which represent mammals, reptiles, birds, humans, objects, and abstract concepts. Masks \"may be seen as a summary of the people, animal, and things that constitute the Dogon world, a visual accounting of the return to order in the universe following the disruption caused by death.\"<ref name=\"Ezra\">Ezra, Kate, ''Art of the Dogon: Selections from the Lester Wunderman Collection'', [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]] (1988), pp. 23\u201325, {{ISBN|9780810918740}} (retrieved March 3, 2020) [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=YdNhUppxc6kC&pg=PA23#v=onepage&q&f=false]</ref>\n\nLike many traditional African religions, the Abrahamic religious concept of [[heaven]] and [[hell]] does not exist in Dogon religion. Ancestor veneration is however an important element. [[Sculpture]]s and masks are normally made by Dogon [[blacksmith]]s, who also work [[iron]]. There are two types of smiths in Dogon society: the ''jemo'' who lives on the plains, and the ''iru'' who live on the plateau.<ref name=\"Ezra\"/><ref>[[Denise Paulme|Paulme, Denise]] .''Organisation sociale des Dogon (Soudan fran\u00e7ais)'', F.

Both the ''jemo'' and ''iru'' serve as [[Intercession|intermediaries]] and peacemakers between other Dogons, between the living and the ancestors, and between mankind and Amma, especially on rituals surrounding [[Rainmaking (ritual)|rainmaking]].

When a person dies, their mouth is covered with a muzzle. This ritual symbolizes the wattles of fish. The dead's head is covered with a white band circling the top of his skull. This symbolizes the top of the fish's head. As they send the deceased to the next life, women and girls perform ritual dances mimicking a fish\u2014with their arms and hands streched out in front of them\u2014symbolizing the swimming of fish. These movements are very suppley done. \"The assimilations go on because a dead person who continues to preserve his spirtual elements (that is, his basic elements) until the afterlife is said to be like \"a fish of heaven.\"<ref name=\"Bonnefoy\"/>\n\n==Ancestral spirits==\n{{main|Nommo}}\nThe '''Nommo''' are [[Veneration of the dead|ancestral spirits]] (sometimes referred to as deities) venerated  by the Dogon.

Folk art depictions of the Nommos show creatures with [[humanoid]] upper torsos, legs/feet, and a fish-like lower torso and tail. The Nommos are also referred to as \u201cMasters of the Water\u201d, \u201cthe Monitors\u201d, and \"The Teachers\u201d.

The Mistress of Speech was immortal and androgynous, but primarily female, and was seen as the perfect combination of Nummo and human. The DNA of the Mistress of Speech was the hope for the world. The Mistress of Speech was associated with weaving.

Since the Mistress of Speech had the perfect DNA or Word, she was the hope for the world. Her twenty-two atticulations, suggesting a form of speech, were important aspects of Dogon religion. Her twenty-two articulations are supposed to represent her twenty-two body parts and \"the evolutionary changes that would occur in humans as a result of her death and resurrection.\" For this reason, each candidate for Dogon priesthood must undergo twenty-two trances, or \"attacks\" called ''soy'' (quaking spells) in Dogon.  Each of these trances corresponds to the Mistress of Speech's body, \"Word\" or DNA. The word ''soy'' also mean seven in Dogon, and thus refer to the \"Sevent Ancestor\", who was the Mistress of Speech.<ref name=\"Day of the Fish by Dorey\">Dorey, Shannon, ''Day of the Fish: The First Religion'' (Volume 3 of Dogon Religion), Elemental Expressions Ltd.

All these festivals occurs within precise temporal cycles and are occasions for young Dogon men to complete their [[Rite of passage|initiation rites]] and receive knowledge from their father, grandfather, or head of family (''ginna bana'').<ref name=\"Adjaye\"/>\n \n#'''Bulo''' : Like the [[Xooy]] divination ceremony of the [[Serer people]] of [[Senegambia region|Senegambia]], the Bulo is a [[New Year]] festival celebrated between May and June in Dogon country. It is an [[Agrarian system|agrarian]] festival marking the beginning of the [[Wet season|rainy season]] and [[millet]] cultivation. Unlike the Xooy however\u2014which is presided over the [[Saltigue]] (the Serer priestly class), the Bulo festival is characterized by masked dances and overflowing canaries of millet beer.<ref>Dogon Country, ''Festivals'' [http://www.dogoncountry.com/about-pays-dogon/festivals/] (retrieved March 13, 2020)</ref> The Bulo festival signals the start of the [[sowing]] season. It takes place during the [[Summer solstice|estival solstice]].<ref name=\"Adjaye\"/><ref name=\"Petit\"/>\n#'''Sigi''' : The Sigi (or Sigui) festival pays homage to Dogon's primordial time, and it's a way of atonement and transmitting secret and ancient knowledge to the younger generation. It is mainly about communicating the revelation of speech to men, a ceremony of atonement and initiation, and a way of demanding pardon for the death of an ancestor after the folly and forgetfulness of some young men. It is a long procession that starts and ends in the village of [[Youga Dogorou]]. The Sigi festival is one of the most well known and anticipated Dogon festivals, and perhaps the most important of all the Dogon rituals.  The Sigi occurs once every sixty years in  the Dogon calendar\u2014determined by the position of the star [[Sirius]] in the [[night sky]]. A person may only live to witness one Sigi festival, or two if they are lucky to live long enough. The 60-year interval is so precise it has baffled some scholars such as anthropologist and  filmmaker [[Jean Rouch]]\u2014many of [[Jean Rouch#Main films|whose works]] are about the subject. The 60-years interval also corresponds to the life span of the mystic Dogon ancestor. Every five days, the Dogon would tie a knot on a rope. This constitutes the Dogon week. In so doing, they are able to celebrate the Sigi with such precision. The last 4 Sigi celebrations occurred in 1787, 1847, 1907, and 1967. The next one will be in the year 2027 (as of 2020).<ref name=\"Adjaye\">Adjaye, Joseph K., ''Time in the Black Experience'' (Issue 167 of Contributions in Afro-American and African studies, {{ISSN|0069-9624}}), [[Greenwood Publishing Group]] (1994), p. 92, {{ISBN|9780313291180}} (retrieved March 3, 2020) [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=PQMlpbxkp_MC&pg=PA92#v=onepage&q&f=false]</ref><ref>Velton, Ross, ''Mali: The Bradt Safari Guide'', [[Bradt Travel Guides]] (2009), p. 192, {{ISBN|9781841622187}} (retrieved March 13, 2020) [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=t8xB7ZG2KOEC&pg=PA192#v=onepage&q&f=false]</ref><ref name=\"Bonnefoy\">Editor: Bonnefoy, Yves; (translated by: Doniger, Wendy ; compiled by: Bonnefoy, Yves),  ''American, African, and Old European Mythologies'', University of Chicago Press (1993), p. 124, {{ISBN|9780226064574}} (retrieved March 3, 2020) [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=GYjc5POwJjAC&pg=PA124#v=onepage&q&f=false]</ref><ref group=note>Guiness World Records gave 2032 as the next Sigui ceremony.

It is one of the first public/private (self-governed, state funded) [[charter school]]s in the United States and opened in 1996. It shares the former [[Wilmington, Delaware|Wilmington High School]] building with [[Cab Calloway School of the Arts]] and occupies the third floor and a wing of the second floor of the building. There were 970 students enrolled in the fall for the 2012-2013 school year.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.charterschool.org/downloads/aboutus/quick-fact-sheet-2013.pdf |title=About Us |publisher=The Charter School of Wilmington |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2013-06-13 }}{{dead link|date=August 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>\n\n==History==\nCharter schools in Delaware were authorized by ''Delaware Code'', Title 14, Chapter five, enacted in 1995. The school is operated by a consortium of six companies: [[AstraZeneca]], [[Verizon Communications|Verizon]], [[Delmarva Power]], [[DuPont]], [[Hercules Inc.|Hercules Incorporated]], and [[Christiana Care Health System]].\n\nThe Charter School of Wilmington was chartered by the [[Red Clay Consolidated School District]], and was directly descended from the 'Academy of Mathematics and Science', an earlier (now defunct) math and science [[magnet school]] run by the district. The school is a [[University-preparatory school|college preparatory]] program that emphasizes mathematics and science education. The [[Cab Calloway School of the Arts]] also occupies the same building (formerly Wilmington High School).\n\nThe Charter School of Wilmington is a member of the National Consortium for Specialized Secondary Schools of Mathematics, Science and Technology.\n\nThe Charter School of Wilmington placed 10th in Newsweek's Best High Schools in 2014.  It was ranked 127th in 2006, 75th in 2007, and 100th in 2008.<ref name=Newsweek>{{cite journal|title=America's Best High Schools 2011 |journal=[[Newsweek]] |date=2011-06-19 |url=http://www.thedailybeast.com/newsweek/features/2011/americas-best-high-schools.html |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111026025239/http://www.thedailybeast.com/newsweek/features/2011/americas-best-high-schools.html |archivedate=October 26, 2011 }}</ref> Furthermore, Charter placed 41st in 2007 and 42nd in 2008 as well as 2009 in U.S. News' America's Best High Schools, earning the Gold Medal.<ref>{{cite news\n| title = America's Best High Schools\n| publisher = U.S.News\n| date = 2008-12-04\n| url = https://www.usnews.com/listings/high-schools/delaware/charter_school_of_wilmington\n| accessdate = 2008-12-07 }}</ref>\n\nCSW was selected as a 2013 National Blue Ribbon School by the U.S. Department of Education and a Recognition School by the Delaware Department of Education for exceptional performance in 2013. CSW is also currently ranked #10 on Newsweek's America's Top High School's list (September 2014) and #30 on the Daily Beast's Top High Schools list (August 2014). In June 2014, CSW's Jefferson Council was honored in Washington, D.C. by the Jefferson Awards as the 2014 National Silver Students in Action recipient for their philanthropic contribution to the community.\n\n==Approach to Education==\n=== Modified Block Scheduling ===\nCharter uses a modified [[Block scheduling|block system]]. With three rotating classes and one fixed class of about 80 minutes each (a mandatory study hall included) along with an \"Activity Period\" slot, the schedule allowed elongated class periods and eliminated the need for many lengthy, after-school extracurricular club meetings. Students have eight class periods total, and four classes per day thereby meeting with a class every other day.\n\n=== Shared classes with Cab Calloway ===\nStudents may elect to take Cab classes focused on visual arts, drama, and the musical arts, [[University of Delaware|UD]] classes, or any other Charter classes during these periods. Cab Calloway classes are still limited in the fact that time slots must match the two schools' schedules and thus certain courses can only be taken during certain class periods.\n\n=== Research projects ===\nDuring the junior year, all students complete a Science Fair project as a necessary requirement to graduate. The Science Fair requirement used to take place during the sophomore year, but restructuring of the research curriculum to better improve research skills beforehand required pushing back the Science Fair requirement. Sophomores are required to take Introduction to Scientific Research (instead of Geosystems, a now defunct class) to prepare them for Science Fair.\n\n==Academics==\n=== General graduation requirements ===\nDelaware state standards mandate semester-long health education and a full year of physical education, split into semester-long freshman and junior gym classes. The Introductory to Computer Science class satisfies the Delaware state standard for computer literacy, and three years of history and four years of math, science and English meet the state requirements for the respective subjects.  A total of 24.5 credits are needed to graduate.\n\n=== Advanced Placement ===\nThe school offers many advanced placement classes which allow students to earn college credit while still attending high school. Advanced placement courses include [[AP Calculus|calculus]] (AB & BC), [[AP Statistics|statistics]], [[AP Biology|biology]], [[AP Chemistry|chemistry]], [[AP Physics C|physics]] (C), [[AP Environmental Science|environmental science]], [[AP Computer Science|computer science]] (A), [[AP English Literature|English literature]], [[AP English Language|English language]], [[AP Latin: Vergil|Latin (Vergil)]], [[AP Latin Literature|Latin literature]], [[AP Spanish Language|Spanish language]], [[AP French Language|French language]], [[Al-Farouq Aminu|AP]] [[AP U. S. History|U.S. history]], [[AP United States Government and Politics|U.S. government and politics]], [[AP World History|world history,]] [[AP Psychology|psychology]], and [[Advanced Placement Program|economics]]. Many students choose to independently study for other AP exams or elect to take AP courses through the Cab Calloway School of the Arts.<ref>[http://www.charterschool.org/aboutUs/schoolProfile.htm Charter School of Wilmington]{{dead link|date=November 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> Sometimes, academically motivated students prefer to self-study the material covered in an advanced placement class instead of attending the class. For students who choose APs as a part of their formal curriculum, taking the end-of-year national AP examination is required in order to pass the course.\n\n===Other Coursework===\nWhile not unique to Charter, there are some course offerings that are not seen at a majority of American high schools. Some of these include software engineering, data structure, [[Differential Equations|differential equations,]] digital electronics design, introduction to [[engineering]], [[robotics]], and [[data]], [[Forensics|forensics, c]]<nowiki/>alculus 3, advertising and marketing, philosophy, programming and algorithms, critical and creative thinking research and publication in human & computer interaction, nanotechnology, modern physics, optics, and others.[[Image:Charter School of Wilm-4.JPG|thumb|left|200px|Students look over a [[Multivariable calculus|UD MATH 243]] problem after school.]]\n\n===Special tests===\nA challenge test administered to incoming freshmen allows prospective students to move up to Integrated Math III or skip the first year of a foreign language course if they test well. (Additional courses can be bypassed through other exams, such as the AP examinations or a French II final). Phases range from 3-6, with non-academic classes (i.e. Driver Education and Gym) at phase 4, phase 5 being considered as honors, and AP and post-AP classes (Calculus 3 and Differential Equations) designated as phase 6.\n\n== Students ==\nThe student body is made up of 960 students as of 2007-2008, including 68% of students coming from area public school districts, and 32% of the students coming from Catholic and other private schools. However, the freshman class for the 2012-2013 school year consists nearly entirely of [[Red Clay Consolidated School District]] students. For the first time since the school's inception, a lottery with out-of-district siblings and children of the founding companies had to be performed. Additionally, the school had to accept fewer students than before, due to district constraints. 99% of students attend college upon graduation. Individual students have won many state and national awards in mathematics, general science, biology, physics, journalism, French, Spanish, Latin and forensics competitions. In addition, students have also gained recognition in sports and other extracurricular activities.<ref name=\"fact\"/>\n\n== Faculty ==\nThe student to teacher ratio is 18:1, with an average class size of 24 students.<ref name=\"fact\"/>\n\nMembers of Charter's faculty were Delaware's English Teacher of the Year in 1997, Conservation Teacher of the Year in 1999, recipients of the Science/Math Excellence in Teaching Award from the Science Alliance in 1999, and Delaware's History Day Teacher of the Year in 2002.<ref name=\"fact\"/>\n\n== Extra-curricular activities ==\n[[Image:Charter School of Wilm-5.JPG|thumb|right|200px|Students play [[Playing card|cards]] out front after school.]]\n\n=== Music ===\nThe Charter School of Wilmington has various musical groups. Those associated with [[Cab Calloway School of the Arts]] are concert band, jazz band, drum line, and marching band. Other groups include show choir, Red Clay String Quartet, and Red Clay Secondary and Select Orchestra.\n\n=== Sports ===\n[[Image:Charter School of Wilm Mascot-1.JPG|thumb|right|200px|The Charter Charger, named '''''Lightning'''''... Colloquially known as the \"Force Horse.\"]] As both Charter School of Wilmington and Cab Calloway School of the Arts share the same building, students from both schools compete on teams representing Charter.\n\nThe sports available include:\n\n*  Football\n*  Cheerleading\n*  Cross Country\n*  Field Hockey\n*  Soccer (boys and girls)\n*  Volleyball (boys and girls)\n*  Marching Band\n*  Basketball (boys and girls)\n*  Dance\n*  Swimming\n*  Indoor and Outdoor Track\n*  Wrestling\n*  Baseball\n*  Crew\n*  Golf\n*  Lacrosse (boys and girls)\n*  Softball\n*Tennis (boys and girls)\n\n<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.forcessports.com/|title=Charter - ForcesSports|website=www.forcessports.com|access-date=2019-11-23}}</ref>\n\n====Club sports====\nSome club sports include fencing, rowing, skiing, mountain biking, kayaking, table tennis, ultimate frisbee, and basketball (intramural).\n\n===Newspaper / Force Media===\nThe school newspaper, ''The Force File'', is a brand-new digital-first newspaper owned and operated solely by students of Charter, started in the 2016 - 2017 school year. It is part of a larger organization known as Force Media, a group which consists of four Charter clubs: Newspaper Club, Photography Club, Ten Minutes Club (which runs a biweekly morning video show at the school, called ''Ten Minutes'') and Charter's chapter of [[Association for Computing Machinery|The Association for Computing Machinery (ACM)]].

Vildan, unable to give up her rich life, wants Nihan to marry Emir to save the family business, but Nihan refuses as she dislikes Emir's arrogance and protectiveness of her. The first meeting between Nihan and Kemal occurs on the bus, and a month later, Kemal saves Nihan's life and from then on their friendship starts and slowly turns in to love.\n\nEmir is aware of Nihan's love, so he executes a plan that results in Ozan killing a girl. Nihan is then left helpless to marry Emir to save Ozan from going to jail. The next day, Kemal proposes to Nihan but she refuses and leaves in tears.

This area includes suburbs in the [[Local government in Australia|local government areas]] of [[Hornsby Shire]], [[City of Ryde]], the [[Municipality of Hunter's Hill]] and parts of the [[City of Parramatta]].\n\nThe [[North Shore (Sydney)|North Shore]], an informal geographic term referring to the northern metropolitan area of Sydney, consists of {{NSWcity|Artarmon}}, {{NSWcity|Chatswood}}, {{NSWcity|Roseville}}, {{NSWcity|Lindfield}}, [[Killara]], {{NSWcity|Gordon}}, {{NSWcity|Pymble}}, {{NSWcity|Hornsby}} and many others.\n\nThe Lower North Shore usually refers to the suburbs adjacent to the harbour such as {{NSWcity|Neutral Bay}}, {{NSWcity|Waverton}}, [[Mosman, New South Wales|Mosman]], {{NSWcity|Cremorne}}, [[Cremorne Point]], {{NSWcity|Lavender Bay}}, [[Milsons Point, New South Wales|Milsons Point]], {{NSWcity|Cammeray}}, [[Northbridge, New South Wales|Northbridge]], and North Sydney. {{NSWcity|Hunters Hill}} and {{NSWcity|Gladesville}} are often also considered as being part of the [[Lower North Shore (Sydney)|Lower North Shore]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Liveable Sydney: The lower north shore's suburbs ranked by liveability|url=https://www.domain.com.au/news/liveable-sydney-lower-north-shore-ranked|date=28 July 2016}}</ref> The Lower North Shore's eastern boundary is [[Middle Harbour]], or at the [[Roseville Bridge]] at {{NSWcity|Castle Cove}} and {{NSWcity|Roseville Chase}}. The Upper North Shore usually refers to the suburbs between {{NSWcity|Chatswood}} and {{NSWcity|Hornsby}}. It is made up of suburbs located within [[Ku-ring-gai Council|Ku-ring-gai]] and [[Hornsby Shire]] councils.\n\nThe North Shore includes the commercial centres of [[North Sydney, New South Wales|North Sydney]] and Chatswood. North Sydney itself consists of a large commercial centre, with its own business centre, which contains the second largest concentration of high-rise buildings in Sydney, after the CBD. North Sydney is dominated by advertising, marketing businesses and associated trades, with many large corporations holding office in the region.\n\nThe Northern Beaches area includes [[Manly, New South Wales|Manly]], one of Sydney's most popular holiday destinations for much of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. The region also features [[Sydney Heads]], a series of [[headlands]] which form the {{cvt|2|km}} wide entrance to Sydney Harbour. The Northern Beaches area extends south to the entrance of Port Jackson (Sydney Harbour), west to [[Middle Harbour]] and north to the entrance of [[Broken Bay]]. The 2011 Australian census found the Northern Beaches to be the most [[White people|white]] and [[mono-ethnic]] district in Australia, contrasting with its more-diverse neighbours, the North Shore and the [[Central Coast (New South Wales)|Central Coast]].<ref>[http://rodis.com.au/wiki/Northern-Beaches-Sydney.php National Regional Profile: Northern Beaches Sydney]</ref>\n\n===Hills district===\nThe [[Hills District|Hills district]] generally refers to the suburbs in north-western Sydney including the local government areas of [[The Hills Shire]], parts of the [[City of Parramatta Council]] and [[Hornsby Shire]]. Actual suburbs and localities that are considered to be in the Hills District can be somewhat amorphous and variable. For example, the Hills District Historical Society restricts its definition to the Hills Shire local government area, yet its study area extends from Parramatta to the Hawkesbury. The region is so named for its characteristically comparatively hilly topography as the Cumberland Plain lifts up, joining the Hornsby Plateau.\n\nSeveral of its suburbs also have \"Hill\" or \"Hills\" in their names, such as [[Baulkham Hills, New South Wales|Baulkham Hills]], [[Castle Hill, New South Wales|Castle Hill]], [[Seven Hills, New South Wales|Seven Hills]], [[Pendle Hill, New South Wales|Pendle Hill]], [[Beaumont Hills, New South Wales|Beaumont Hills]], and [[Winston Hills, New South Wales|Winston Hills]], among others.

The [[Cumberland Plain]] lies to the south and west of the Harbour and is relatively flat. The Hornsby Plateau is located to the north and is dissected by steep valleys. The flat areas of the south were the first to be developed as the city grew. It was not until the construction of the Sydney Harbour Bridge that the northern reaches of the coast became more heavily populated. [[Beaches in Sydney|Seventy beaches]] can be found along its coastline with Bondi Beach being one of the most famous.\n\nThe [[Nepean River]] wraps around the western edge of the city and becomes the Hawkesbury River before reaching [[Broken Bay]]. Most of Sydney's water storages can be found on tributaries of the Nepean River. The [[Parramatta River]] is mostly industrial and drains a large area of Sydney's western suburbs into Port Jackson. The southern parts of the city are drained by the [[Georges River]] and the [[Cooks River]] into Botany Bay.\n\n===Geology===\n[[File:Vaucluse_Sydney.png|thumb|Almost all of the exposed rocks around Sydney are [[Sydney sandstone]].|alt=]]\nSydney is made up of mostly Triassic rock with some recent [[igneous]] dykes and [[volcanic]] necks.

It is made up of suburbs located within [[Ku-ring-gai Council|Ku-ring-gai]] and [[Hornsby Shire]] councils.\n\nThe North Shore includes the commercial centres of [[North Sydney, New South Wales|North Sydney]] and Chatswood. North Sydney itself consists of a large commercial centre, with its own business centre, which contains the second largest concentration of high-rise buildings in Sydney, after the CBD. North Sydney is dominated by advertising, marketing businesses and associated trades, with many large corporations holding office in the region.\n\nThe Northern Beaches area includes [[Manly, New South Wales|Manly]], one of Sydney's most popular holiday destinations for much of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. The region also features [[Sydney Heads]], a series of [[headlands]] which form the {{cvt|2|km}} wide entrance to Sydney Harbour. The Northern Beaches area extends south to the entrance of Port Jackson (Sydney Harbour), west to [[Middle Harbour]] and north to the entrance of [[Broken Bay]]. The 2011 Australian census found the Northern Beaches to be the most [[White people|white]] and [[mono-ethnic]] district in Australia, contrasting with its more-diverse neighbours, the North Shore and the [[Central Coast (New South Wales)|Central Coast]].<ref>[http://rodis.com.au/wiki/Northern-Beaches-Sydney.php National Regional Profile: Northern Beaches Sydney]</ref>\n\n===Hills district===\nThe [[Hills District|Hills district]] generally refers to the suburbs in north-western Sydney including the local government areas of [[The Hills Shire]], parts of the [[City of Parramatta Council]] and [[Hornsby Shire]].

For example, the Hills District Historical Society restricts its definition to the Hills Shire local government area, yet its study area extends from Parramatta to the Hawkesbury. The region is so named for its characteristically comparatively hilly topography as the Cumberland Plain lifts up, joining the Hornsby Plateau.\n\nSeveral of its suburbs also have \"Hill\" or \"Hills\" in their names, such as [[Baulkham Hills, New South Wales|Baulkham Hills]], [[Castle Hill, New South Wales|Castle Hill]], [[Seven Hills, New South Wales|Seven Hills]], [[Pendle Hill, New South Wales|Pendle Hill]], [[Beaumont Hills, New South Wales|Beaumont Hills]], and [[Winston Hills, New South Wales|Winston Hills]], among others.
