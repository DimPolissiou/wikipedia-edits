Henry, on moving to the Hastings area where he was married, founded a school, known as Seafield School, of which he became the headmaster. Granville's mother, Amy, was raised in [[Giggleswick]] near [[Settle, North Yorkshire|Settle]] in Yorkshire. She carried the middle name Fiennes, in common with a number of her relations. Combined with her maiden surname Twisleton, this carried the heavy implication that she was related to the Twiselton-Fiennes-Wycham family, the holders of the [[Twisleton-Wykeham-Fiennes baronets|Baronetcy of Banbury]], the current incumbent being Sir [[Ranulph Fiennes]]. The link is not fully established, although the Twiselton from whom the Baronet has inherited the name was himself from Yorkshire. What is certain is that Amy's forefather, Francis Twiselton was known as a giant of a man, standing 7'3''. His stature was recorded to have passed down the generations, and may have contributed to Granville's height and weight making him ideal for the rugby union position of lock.\n\nGranville attended [[Rugby School]]<ref>A.

It was from Cambridge that he was selected for the 1927 tour to Argentina. On this tour he was one of a number of uncapped players who was selected to play against the Argentina national side.

In turn, his son Terence became the headmaster until the school's closure.\n\nSeafield School was a school for boys aged between 8 and 13. It was located on Collington Lane West, one of three schools on the lane the others being Falconbury, also a boys' school and Effingham, for girls. These three schools were visited by [[Queen Elizabeth II]] in the 1960s. Seafield itself was used as quarters for a Canadian Anti Aircraft Battery that was serving in defence of Bexhill and Cooden Beach during the [[Second World War]]. Seafield and its two counterparts were closed in the early 1970s to open up land to be used for building new homes. However, their crests were preserved in a specially dedicated stained-glass window in the nearby St Mark's church of the parish of [[Bexhill-on-Sea|Bexhill]].

There are Egyptologists{{who|date=January 2020}} that believe the translation may be more like; \"The-life-of-Aten-is-pleasing\" or \"One-perfect-of-life-is-Aten\".\n\nTutankhamun restored the [[Ancient Egyptian religion]] after its dissolution by his father, enriched and endowed the priestly orders of two important cults and began restoring old monuments damaged during the previous [[Amarna period]]. He moved his father's remains to the Valley of the Kings as well as moving the capitol from [[Akhetaten]] to [[Thebes, Egypt|Thebes]]. Tutankhamun was physically disabled with a deformity of his left foot along with bone necrosis that required the use of a cane, several of which were found in his tomb as well as body armor and bows, having been trained in archery. He had other health issues including scoliosis and had contracted several strains of malaria.\n\nThe 1922 discovery by [[Howard Carter]] of Tutankhamun's [[KV62|nearly intact tomb]], in excavations funded by [[George Herbert, 5th Earl of Carnarvon|Lord Carnarvon]],{{sfn|Hawass|2004|page=73}} received worldwide press coverage. With over 5,000 artifacts, it sparked a renewed public interest in [[ancient Egypt]], for which [[Tutankhamun's mask]], now in the [[Egyptian Museum]], remains a popular symbol. The deaths of a few involved in the discovery of [[Tutankhamun's mummy]] have been popularly attributed to the [[curse of the pharaohs]]. He has, since the discovery of his intact tomb, been referred to colloquially as \"'''King Tut'''\".\n\nSome of his treasure has traveled worldwide with unprecedented response. The Egyptian Supreme Council of Antiquities allowed tours beginning in 1962 with the exhibit at the Louvre in Paris, followed by the Kyoto Municipal Museum of Art in Tokyo, Japan. The exhibits drew in millions of visitors. The 1972 - 1979 exhibit was shown in United States, Soviet Union, Japan, France, Canada, and West Germany.

English Egyptologist [[Battiscombe Gunn]] believed that the older interpretation did not fit with [[Atenism|Akhenaten's theology]]. Gunn believed that such an name would have been [[blasphemous]]. He saw ''tut'' as a verb and not a noun and gave his translation in 1926 as ''The-life-of-Aten-is-pleasing''. Professor [[Gerhard Fecht]] also believed the word ''tut'' was a verb. He noted that Akhenaten used ''tit'' as a word for 'image', not ''tut''. Fecht translated the verb ''tut'' as ''\"To be perfect/complete\"''. Using Aten as the subject, Fecht's full translation was ''\"One-perfect-of-life-is-Aten\"''. The Hermopolis Block (two carved block fragments discovered in Ashmunein) has a unique spelling of the first nomen written as ''Tutankhuaten''; it uses ''ankh'' as a verb, which does support the older translation of ''Living-image-of-Aten''.<ref name=\"Eaton-Krauss2015\">{{cite book|author=Marianne Eaton-Krauss|title=The Unknown Tutankhamun|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7cuBCgAAQBAJ&pg=PA29|date=17 December 2015|publisher=Bloomsbury Publishing|isbn=978-1-4725-7563-0|pages=28\u201329}}</ref>\n\n===End of Armarna period===\n[[File:Spaziergang im Garten Amarna Berlin.jpg|thumb|right|Egyptian art of the Armarna period]]\nOnce crowned and after \"Taking council\" with the god Amun, Tutankhamun made several endowments that enriched and added to the priestly numbers of the cults of Amun and Ptah.

He renounced the god Aten, relegating it to obscurity and returned Egyptian religion to its [[Polytheism|polytheistic]] form. His first act as pharaoh was to remove his father's mummy from his tomb at Akhetaten and rebury it in the [[Valley of the Kings]]. This helped strengthen his reign.

Diplomatic relations with other kingdoms had been neglected, and Tutankhamun sought to restore them, in particular with the [[Mitanni]]. Evidence of his success is suggested by the gifts from various countries found in his tomb. Despite his efforts for improved relations, battles with [[Nubians]] and [[Asiatics]] were recorded in his mortuary temple at Thebes. His tomb contained body armor, folding stools appropriate for military campaigns, and bows, and he was trained in archery.{{sfn|Gilbert|Holt|Hudson|1976|pp=28\u20139}} However, given his youth and physical disabilities, which seemed to require the use of a cane in order to walk, most historians speculate that he did not personally take part in these battles.{{sfn|Hawass|2010|pages=638\u2013647}}{{sfn|Booth|2007|pages=86\u201387}}\n\nGiven his age, the king probably had advisers which presumably included [[Ay]] (who succeeded Tutankhamun) and General [[Horemheb]], Ay's possible son in law and successor.

He ended the worship of the god [[Aten]] and restored the god [[Amun]] to supremacy. The ban on the cult of Amun was lifted and traditional privileges were restored to its priesthood. The capital was moved back to [[Thebes, Egypt|Thebes]] and the city of [[Akhetaten]] was abandoned.<ref>[[Erik Hornung]], ''Akhenaten and the Religion of Light'', Translated by David Lorton, Ithaca, New York: Cornell University Press, 2001, {{ISBN|0-8014-8725-0}}.</ref> As part of his restoration, the king initiated building projects, in particular at [[Karnak]] in Thebes, where he laid out the sphinx avenue leading to the temple of Mut.

As [[Jon Manchip White]] writes, in his foreword to the 1977 edition of Carter's ''The Discovery of the Tomb of Tutankhamun'', \"The pharaoh who in life was one of the least esteemed of Egypt's Pharaohs has become in death the most renowned\".<ref>{{cite book |last1=Carter |first1=Howard |last2=Mace |first2=A.C. |title=The Discovery of the Tomb of Tutankhamen |publisher=Dover Publications |isbn=0486235009 |url=https://archive.org/details/discoveryoftombo00cart |year=1977 }}</ref>\n\nThe discoveries in the tomb were prominent news in the 1920s. Tutankhamen came to be called by a modern neologism, \"King Tut\". Ancient Egyptian references became common in popular culture, including [[Tin Pan Alley]] songs; the most popular of the latter was \"Old King Tut\" by [[Harry Von Tilzer]] from 1923, which was recorded by such prominent artists of the time as [[The Happiness Boys|Jones & Hare]] and [[Sophie Tucker]]. \"King Tut\" became the name of products, businesses, and the [[United States presidential pets#List of Presidential pets|pet dog]] of U.S. President [[Herbert Hoover]].<ref>{{cite web |title=The First Family's Pets |url=https://hoover.archives.gov/hoovers/first-familys-pets |website=hoover.archives.gov |publisher=The Herbert Hoover Presidential Library and Museum |accessdate=12 July 2019|date=8 May 2017 }}</ref>\n\n===International exhibitions===\n{{further|Exhibitions of artifacts from the tomb of Tutankhamun}}\n[[File:M.

With the ending of that conflict, the [[Louvre Museum]] in Paris was quickly able to arrange an exhibition of Tutankhamun's treasures through [[Christiane Desroches Noblecourt]]. The French Egyptologist was already in Egypt as part of a [[UNESCO]] appointment. The French exhibit drew 1.2 million visitors. Noblecourt had also convinced the Egyptian Minister of Culture to allow British photographer [[George Rainbird]] to re-photograph the collection in color. The new color photos as well as the Louvre exhibition began a Tutankhamun revival.<ref name=\"Carruthers2014\">{{cite book|author=William Carruthers|title=Histories of Egyptology: Interdisciplinary Measures|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9doABAAAQBAJ&pg=PA168|date=11 July 2014|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-135-01457-5|page=168}}</ref>\n\nIn 1965 the Tutankhamun exhibit traveled to [[Tokyo, Japan]] where it garnered more visitors than the future New York exhibit in 1979.

There are Egyptologists{{who|date=January 2020}} that believe the translation may be more like; \"The-life-of-Aten-is-pleasing\" or \"One-perfect-of-life-is-Aten\".\n\nTutankhamun restored the [[Ancient Egyptian religion]] after its dissolution by his father, enriched and endowed the priestly orders of two important cults and began restoring old monuments damaged during the previous [[Amarna period]]. He moved his father's remains to the Valley of the Kings as well as moving the capitol from [[Akhetaten]] to [[Thebes, Egypt|Thebes]]. Tutankhamun was physically disabled with a deformity of his left foot along with bone necrosis that required the use of a cane, several of which where found in his tomb as well as body armor and bows, having been trained in archery. He had other health issues including scoliosis and had contracted several strains of malaria.\n\nThe 1922 discovery by [[Howard Carter]] of Tutankhamun's [[KV62|nearly intact tomb]], in excavations funded by [[George Herbert, 5th Earl of Carnarvon|Lord Carnarvon]],{{sfn|Hawass|2004|page=73}} received worldwide press coverage. With over 5,000 artifacts, it sparked a renewed public interest in [[ancient Egypt]], for which [[Tutankhamun's mask]], now in the [[Egyptian Museum]], remains a popular symbol. The deaths of a few involved in the discovery of [[Tutankhamun's mummy]] have been popularly attributed to the [[curse of the pharaohs]]. He has, since the discovery of his intact tomb, been referred to colloquially as \"'''King Tut'''\".\n\nSome of his treasure has traveled worldwide with unprecedented response. The Egyptian Supreme Council of Antiquities allowed tours beginning in 1962 with the exhibit at the Louvre in Paris, followed by the Kyoto Municipal Museum of Art in Tokyo, Japan. The exhibits drew in millions of visitors. The 1972 - 1979 exhibit was shown in United States, Soviet Union, Japan, France, Canada, and West Germany. There were no international exhibitions again until 2005 - 2011. This exhibit featured Tutankhamun's predecessors from the 18th dynasty, including Hatshepsut and Akhenaten, but did not include the golden death mask. The treasures 2019-2022 tour began in Los Angeles and will end in 2022 at the new Grand Egyptian Museum in Cairo, which, for the first time, will be displaying the full Tutankhamun collection, gathered from all of Egypt's museums and storerooms.\n\n==Family==\n[[File:Anuk.PNG|thumb|upright|Tutankhamun and his queen, [[Ankhesenamun]]]]\nTutankhamun was the son of [[Akhenaten]] (originally named Amenhotep IV{{sfn|Roberts|2006|page=187}}) who is believed to be the mummy found in tomb KV55.{{sfn|Cooney|Jasnow|2015|page=219}} His mother is one of Akhenaten's sisters.{{sfn|Hawass|2010|pages=640\u2013641}} At birth he was named Tutankhaten, a name reflecting the [[Atenism|Atenist]] beliefs of his father.

English Egyptologist [[Battiscombe Gunn]] believed that the older interpretation did not fit with [[Atenism|Akhenaten's theology]]. Gunn believed that such an name would have been [[blasphemous]]. He saw ''tut'' as a verb and not a noun and gave his translation in 1926 as ''The-life-of-Aten-is-pleasing''. Professor [[Gerhard Fecht]] also believed the word ''tut'' was a verb. He noted that Akhenaten used ''tit'' as a word for 'image', not ''tut''. Fecht translated the verb ''tut'' as ''\"To be perfect/complete\"''. Using Aten as the subject, Fecht's full translation was ''\"One-perfect-of-life-is-Aten\"''. The Hermopolis Block (two carved block fragments discovered in Ashmunein) has a unique spelling of the first nomen written as ''Tutankhuaten''; it uses ''ankh'' as a verb, which does support the older translation of ''Living-image-of-Aten''.<ref name=\"Eaton-Krauss2015\">{{cite book|author=Marianne Eaton-Krauss|title=The Unknown Tutankhamun|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7cuBCgAAQBAJ&pg=PA29|date=17 December 2015|publisher=Bloomsbury Publishing|isbn=978-1-4725-7563-0|pages=28\u201329}}</ref>\n\n===End of Armarna period===\n[[File:Spaziergang im Garten Amarna Berlin.jpg|thumb|right|Egyptian art of the Armarna period]]\nOnce crowned and after \"Taking council\" with the god Amun, Tutankhamun made several endowments that enriched and added to the priestly numbers of the cults of Amun and Ptah.

He renounced the god Aten, relegating it to obscurity and returned Egyptian religion to its [[Polytheism|polytheistic]] form. His first act as pharaoh was to remove his father's mummy from his tomb at Akhetaten and rebury it in the [[Valley of the Kings]]. This helped strengthen his reign. Tutankhamun rebuilt the stelae, shrines and buildings at Karnak. He added works to Luxor as well as beginning the restoration of other temples throughout Egypt that were pillaged by Akhenaten.<ref name=\"Zaki2008\">{{cite book|author=Mey Zaki|title=Legacy of Tutankhamun: Art and History|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XaHr38i0zR0C|year=2008|publisher=American Univ in Cairo Press|page= 19|isbn=978-977-17-4930-1}}</ref>\n\n==Campaigns, monuments and construction==\nThe country was economically weak and in turmoil following the reign of Akhenaten. Diplomatic relations with other kingdoms had been neglected, and Tutankhamun sought to restore them, in particular with the [[Mitanni]]. Evidence of his success is suggested by the gifts from various countries found in his tomb. Despite his efforts for improved relations, battles with [[Nubians]] and [[Asiatics]] were recorded in his mortuary temple at Thebes. His tomb contained body armor, folding stools appropriate for military campaigns, and bows, and he was trained in archery.{{sfn|Gilbert|Holt|Hudson|1976|pp=28\u20139}} However, given his youth and physical disabilities, which seemed to require the use of a cane in order to walk, most historians speculate that he did not personally take part in these battles.{{sfn|Hawass|2010|pages=638\u2013647}}{{sfn|Booth|2007|pages=86\u201387}}\n\nGiven his age, the king probably had advisers which presumably included [[Ay]] (who succeeded Tutankhamun) and General [[Horemheb]], Ay's possible son in law and successor.

He also noted his ability to calm the young king when his temper flared.{{sfn|Booth|2007|pages=86\u201387}}\n\nIn his third [[regnal year]] Tutankhamun reversed several changes made during his father's reign. He ended the worship of the god [[Aten]] and restored the god [[Amun]] to supremacy. The ban on the cult of Amun was lifted and traditional privileges were restored to its priesthood. The capital was moved back to [[Thebes, Egypt|Thebes]] and the city of [[Akhetaten]] was abandoned.<ref>[[Erik Hornung]], ''Akhenaten and the Religion of Light'', Translated by David Lorton, Ithaca, New York: Cornell University Press, 2001, {{ISBN|0-8014-8725-0}}.</ref> As part of his restoration, the king initiated building projects, in particular at [[Karnak]] in Thebes, where he laid out the sphinx avenue leading to the temple of Mut.

The French Egyptologist was already in Egypt as part of a [[UNESCO]] appointment. The French exhibit drew 1.2 million visitors.

The treaty's full name is '''Agreement between the Government of the United States of America and the Government of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland for Cooperation on the uses of Atomic Energy for Mutual Defense Purposes'''. It allows the United States and the UK to exchange nuclear materials, technology and information. While the US has [[nuclear sharing|nuclear co-operation]] agreements with other countries, including France and other [[NATO]] countries, this agreement is by far the most comprehensive. Because of the agreement's strategic value to Britain, [[Harold Macmillan]] (the [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Prime Minister]] who presided over the United Kingdom's entry into the agreement) called it \"the Great Prize\".{{sfn|Macmillan|1971|p=323}}\n\nThe treaty was signed on 3 July 1958, after the [[Soviet Union]] [[Sputnik crisis|shocked the American public]] with the launch of [[Sputnik]] on 4 October 1957, and the [[British hydrogen bomb programme]] successfully tested a [[thermonuclear device]] in the [[Operation Grapple]] test on 8 November. The Anglo-American [[Special Relationship]] proved mutually beneficial, although it was never one of equals after the World Wars; the United States was (and is) far larger than Britain both militarily and economically. Britain soon became dependent on the United States for its nuclear weapons, as it lacked the resources to produce a range of designs. The treaty allowed American nuclear weapons to be supplied to Britain through [[Project E]], for use by the [[Royal Air Force]] and [[British Army of the Rhine]].\n\nThe treaty provided for the sale to the UK of one complete [[nuclear marine propulsion|nuclear submarine propulsion]] plant, plus ten years' supply of [[enriched uranium]] to fuel it. Other nuclear material was also acquired from the United States under the treaty. Some 5.4 tonnes of UK-produced [[plutonium]] was sent to the US in return for {{convert|6.7|kg|lb}} of [[tritium]] and 7.5 tonnes of [[highly enriched uranium]] (HEU) between 1960 and 1979, although much of the HEU was used not for weapons, but as fuel for the growing fleet of UK [[nuclear submarine]]s. The treaty paved the way for the [[Polaris Sales Agreement]], and the [[Royal Navy]] ultimately acquired entire weapons systems, with the [[UK Polaris programme]] and [[Trident nuclear programme]] using American missiles with British nuclear warheads.\n\nThe treaty has been amended and renewed nine times. The most recent renewal extended it to 31 December 2024.\n\n== Background ==\n=== Quebec Agreement ===\n[[File:Winston Churchill at the Quebec Conference, August 1943 H32144.jpg|thumb|right|[[Quebec Conference, 1943|Quebec Conference]] in 1943. Seated are (left to right): [[Anthony Eden]], President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]], the [[Princess Alice, Countess of Athlone|Countess of Athlone]] and [[Winston Churchill]]. Standing are (left to right): [[Alexander Cambridge, 1st Earl of Athlone|Earl of Athlone]] ([[Governor General of Canada]]), [[Mackenzie King]] ([[Prime Minister of Canada]]), Sir [[Alexander Cadogan]], and [[Brendan Bracken]].]]\nDuring the early part of the [[Second World War]], Britain had a [[nuclear weapons]] project, codenamed [[Tube Alloys]].{{sfn|Gowing|1964|pp=108\u2013111}} At the [[Quadrant Conference]] in August 1943, the [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom]], [[Winston Churchill]], and the [[President of the United States]], [[Franklin Roosevelt]], signed the [[Quebec Agreement]], which merged Tube Alloys with the American [[Manhattan Project]] to create a combined British, American and Canadian project.{{sfn|Hewlett|Anderson|1962|p=277}} The Quebec Agreement established the [[Combined Policy Committee]] and the [[Combined Development Trust]] to co-ordinate their efforts.{{sfn|Hewlett|Anderson|1962|pp=285\u2013286}} Many of Britain's top scientists [[British contribution to the Manhattan Project|participated in the Manhattan Project]].{{sfn|Gowing|1964|pp=236\u2013242}}\n\nThe September 1944 [[Hyde Park Aide-M\u00e9moire]] extended both commercial and military co-operation into the post-war period,{{sfn|Gowing|1964|pp=340\u2013342}} but Roosevelt died on 12 April 1945, and it was not binding on subsequent administrations.{{sfn|Paul|2000|pp=72\u201373}} In fact, it was physically lost. When [[Field marshal (United Kingdom)|Field Marshal]] Sir [[Henry Maitland Wilson]] raised the matter in a Combined Policy Committee meeting in June 1945, the American copy could not be found.{{sfn|Hewlett|Anderson|1962|pp=457\u2013458}} The Quebec Agreement specified that nuclear weapons would not be used against another country without mutual consent. On 4 July, Wilson gave British agreement for the [[atomic bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki|use of nuclear weapons against Japan]].{{sfn|Gowing|1964|p=372}} On 8 August the Prime Minister, [[Clement Attlee]], sent a message to President [[Harry Truman]] in which he referred to themselves as \"heads of the Governments which have control of this great force\".{{sfn|Goldberg|1964|p=410}}{{sfn|Hewlett|Anderson|1962|pp=372\u2013373}}\n\n=== Truman administration ===\nThe British government had trusted that the United States would continue to share nuclear technology, which it considered to be a joint discovery.{{sfn|Goldberg|1964|p=410}} On 9 November 1945, Attlee and the [[Prime Minister of Canada]], [[Mackenzie King]], went to Washington, DC, to confer with Truman about future co-operation in nuclear weapons and nuclear power.{{sfn|Gott|1963|p=240}}{{sfn|Gowing|Arnold|1974a|pp=73\u201377}} A Memorandum of Intention they signed on 16 November 1945 made Canada a full partner, and replaced the Quebec Agreement's requirement for \"mutual consent\" before using nuclear weapons with one for \"prior consultation\". There was to be \"full and effective co-operation in the field of atomic energy\", but British hopes were soon disappointed;{{sfn|Gowing|Arnold|1974a|p=92}} this was only \"in the field of basic scientific research\".{{sfn|Paul|2000|pp=80\u201383}}{{sfn|Hewlett|Anderson|1962|p=468}}\n\nTechnical co-operation was ended by the [[United States Atomic Energy Act of 1946]] (McMahon Act), which forbade passing \"restricted data\" to the United States' allies under pain of death.{{sfn|Gowing|Arnold|1974a|pp=106\u2013108}} This partly resulted from the arrest for espionage of British physicist [[Alan Nunn May]] in February 1946, while the legislation was being debated.{{sfn|Gowing|Arnold|1974a|pp=105\u2013108}} Fearing a resurgence of [[United States non-interventionism|American isolationism]], and Britain losing its [[great power]] status, the British government restarted its own development effort,{{sfn|Gowing|Arnold|1974a|pp=181\u2013184}} now codenamed [[High Explosive Research]].{{sfn|Cathcart|1995|pp=23\u201324, 48, 57}}\n\nBy the end of 1947, {{convert|1900|lt}} of uranium ore from the [[Belgian Congo]] was stockpiled for the Combined Development Trust at [[Springfields]], near [[Preston, Lancashire|Preston]] in [[Lancashire]], as part of a wartime sharing agreement, along with {{convert|1350|lt}} for British use. To gain access to the stockpile for their own nuclear weapons project, the Americans opened negotiations that resulted in the ''[[Modus Vivendi]]'',{{sfn|Gowing|Arnold|1974a|pp=358\u2013360}} an agreement which was signed on 7 January 1948.

Under the July 1956 agreement and a February 1957 directive from Eisenhower, [[Royal Navy]] officers had been assigned to study the US Navy's nuclear submarine programme. By October 1957, its head, [[Rear Admiral (United States)|Rear Admiral]] [[Hyman G. Rickover]], felt that their questions were slowing the deployment of the [[UGM-27 Polaris|Polaris]] submarine-launched IRBM at a critical time. He feared that any delay might cause Congress to favour land-based missiles. By December, the British liaison officers were complaining of slow response to their questions. Rickover proposed that [[Westinghouse Electric Company|Westinghouse]] be permitted to sell the Royal Navy a nuclear submarine reactor, which would allow it to immediately proceed with building its own nuclear-powered submarine. The British government endorsed this idea, as it would save it a great deal of money.{{sfn|Botti|1987|p=203}}{{sfn|Baylis|2008|pp=441\u2013442}}\n\n===Amending the McMahon Act===\nFor their part, the British wanted the McMahon Act's restrictions on nuclear co-operation to be relaxed.

Durham]], the chairman of the JCAE. Eisenhower met with congressional leaders on 3 December 1957, and pressed for more discretion to co-operate with all America's [[NATO]] allies, and not just Britain.{{sfn|Botti|1987|pp=207\u2013208}} Indeed, the administration negotiated agreements with Australia, Canada and NATO.{{sfn|Botti|1987|p=214}} While Eisenhower did not yet have wholehearted support for the proposal, outright opposition from [[United States Senate|Senator]] [[Clinton Anderson]] failed to attract much support.{{sfn|Botti|1987|pp=207\u2013208}} On 27 January 1958, Strauss sent Durham the administration's proposed legislative changes,{{sfn|Botti|1987|p=214}} and the JCAE Subcommittee on Agreements for Cooperation, chaired by Senator [[John Pastore]], held hearings from 29 to 31 January.

It now limited exchanges of nuclear weapons data to nations that had made substantial progress in the field. The same restriction applied to the actual transfer of non-nuclear components of nuclear weapons.

The treaty's full name is '''Agreement between the Government of the United States of America and the Government of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland for Cooperation on the uses of Atomic Energy for Mutual Defense Purposes'''. It allows the United States and the UK to exchange nuclear materials, technology and information. While the US has [[nuclear sharing|nuclear co-operation]] agreements with other countries, including France and other [[NATO]] countries, this agreement is by far the most comprehensive. Because of the agreement's strategic value to Britain, [[Harold Macmillan]] (the [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Prime Minister]] who presided over the United Kingdom's entry into the agreement) called it \"the Great Prize\".{{sfn|Macmillan|1971|p=323}}\n\nThe treaty was signed on 3 July 1958, after the [[Soviet Union]] [[Sputnik crisis|shocked the American public]] with the launch of [[Sputnik]] on 4 October 1957, and the [[British hydrogen bomb programme]] successfully tested a [[thermonuclear device]] in the [[Operation Grapple]] test on 8 November. The Anglo-American [[Special Relationship]] proved mutually beneficial, although it was never one of equals after the World Wars; the United States was (and is) far larger than Britain both militarily and economically. Britain soon became dependent on the United States for its nuclear weapons, as it lacked the resources to produce a range of designs. The treaty allowed American nuclear weapons to be supplied to Britain through [[Project E]], for use by the [[Royal Air Force]] and [[British Army of the Rhine]].\n\nThe treaty provided for the sale to the UK of one complete [[nuclear marine propulsion|nuclear submarine propulsion]] plant, plus ten years' supply of [[enriched uranium]] to fuel it. Other nuclear material was also acquired from the United States under the treaty. Some 5.4 tonnes of UK-produced [[plutonium]] was sent to the US in return for {{convert|6.7|kg|lb}} of [[tritium]] and 7.5 tonnes of [[highly enriched uranium]] (HEU) between 1960 and 1979, although much of the HEU was used not for weapons, but as fuel for the growing fleet of UK [[nuclear submarine]]s. The treaty paved the way for the [[Polaris Sales Agreement]], and the [[Royal Navy]] ultimately acquired entire weapons systems, with the [[UK Polaris programme]] and [[Trident nuclear programme]] using American missiles with British nuclear warheads.\n\nThe treaty has been amended and renewed nine times. The most recent renewal extended it to 31 December 2024.\n\n== Background ==\n=== Quebec Agreement ===\n[[File:Winston Churchill at the Quebec Conference, August 1943 H32144.jpg|thumb|right|[[Quebec Conference, 1943|Quebec Conference]] in 1943.

When [[Field marshal (United Kingdom)|Field Marshal]] Sir [[Henry Maitland Wilson]] raised the matter in a Combined Policy Committee meeting in June 1945, the American copy could not be found.{{sfn|Hewlett|Anderson|1962|pp=457\u2013458}} The Quebec Agreement specified that nuclear weapons would not be used against another country without mutual consent. On 4 July, Wilson gave British agreement for the [[atomic bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki|use of nuclear weapons against Japan]].{{sfn|Gowing|1964|p=372}} On 8 August the Prime Minister, [[Clement Attlee]], sent a message to President [[Harry Truman]] in which he referred to themselves as \"heads of the Governments which have control of this great force\".{{sfn|Goldberg|1964|p=410}}{{sfn|Hewlett|Anderson|1962|pp=372\u2013373}}\n\n=== Truman administration ===\nThe British government had trusted that the United States would continue to share nuclear technology, which it considered to be a joint discovery.{{sfn|Goldberg|1964|p=410}} On 9 November 1945, Attlee and the [[Prime Minister of Canada]], [[Mackenzie King]], went to Washington, DC, to confer with Truman about future co-operation in nuclear weapons and nuclear power.{{sfn|Gott|1963|p=240}}{{sfn|Gowing|Arnold|1974a|pp=73\u201377}} A Memorandum of Intention they signed on 16 November 1945 made Canada a full partner, and replaced the Quebec Agreement's requirement for \"mutual consent\" before using nuclear weapons with one for \"prior consultation\". There was to be \"full and effective co-operation in the field of atomic energy\", but British hopes were soon disappointed;{{sfn|Gowing|Arnold|1974a|p=92}} this was only \"in the field of basic scientific research\".{{sfn|Paul|2000|pp=80\u201383}}{{sfn|Hewlett|Anderson|1962|p=468}}\n\nTechnical co-operation was ended by the [[United States Atomic Energy Act of 1946]] (McMahon Act), which forbade passing \"restricted data\" to the United States' allies under pain of death.{{sfn|Gowing|Arnold|1974a|pp=106\u2013108}} This partly resulted from the arrest for espionage of British physicist [[Alan Nunn May]] in February 1946, while the legislation was being debated.{{sfn|Gowing|Arnold|1974a|pp=105\u2013108}} Fearing a resurgence of [[United States non-interventionism|American isolationism]], and Britain losing its [[great power]] status, the British government restarted its own development effort,{{sfn|Gowing|Arnold|1974a|pp=181\u2013184}} now codenamed [[High Explosive Research]].{{sfn|Cathcart|1995|pp=23\u201324, 48, 57}}\n\nBy the end of 1947, {{convert|1900|lt}} of uranium ore from the [[Belgian Congo]] was stockpiled for the Combined Development Trust at [[Springfields]], near [[Preston, Lancashire|Preston]] in [[Lancashire]], as part of a wartime sharing agreement, along with {{convert|1350|lt}} for British use. To gain access to the stockpile for their own nuclear weapons project, the Americans opened negotiations that resulted in the ''[[Modus Vivendi]]'',{{sfn|Gowing|Arnold|1974a|pp=358\u2013360}} an agreement which was signed on 7 January 1948. This officially terminated all previous agreements, including the Quebec Agreement. It removed the British right of consultation on the use of nuclear weapons,{{sfn|Botti|1987|pp=34\u201335}} allowed for limited sharing of technical information between the United States, Britain and Canada,{{sfn|Gowing|Arnold|1974a|pp=245\u2013254}}{{sfn|Hewlett|Duncan|1969|pp=281\u2013283}} and continued the Combined Policy Committee and the Combined Development Trust,{{sfn|Botti|1987|pp=34\u201335}} although the latter was renamed the [[Combined Development Agency]].{{sfn|Gowing|Arnold|1974a|pp=352\u2013353}}{{sfn|Hewlett|Duncan|1969|p=285}}\n\nIn 1949, the Americans offered to make atomic bombs in the United States available for Britain to use if the British agreed to curtail their atomic bomb programme.{{sfn|Hewlett|Duncan|1969|pp=307\u2013308}} This would have given Britain nuclear weapons much sooner than its own target date of late 1952.{{sfn|Hewlett|Duncan|1969|p=310}} Only those bomb components required by war plans would be stored in the UK, the rest would be kept in the US and Canada.{{sfn|Gowing|Arnold|1974a|pp=281\u2013283}} The offer was rejected by the British on the grounds that it was not \"compatible with our status as a first-class power to depend on others for weapons of this supreme importance\".{{sfn|Baylis|1995|p=75}}\n\nAs a counter-offer, the British proposed limiting the British programme in return for American bombs.{{sfn|Hewlett|Duncan|1969|pp=309\u2013310}} The opposition of key American officials, including [[Lewis Strauss]] from the [[United States Atomic Energy Commission]] (AEC), and Senators [[Bourke B. Hickenlooper]] and [[Arthur Vandenberg]] of the [[Joint Committee on Atomic Energy]] (JCAE), coupled with security concerns aroused by the 2 February 1950 arrest of the British physicist [[Klaus Fuchs]], as an [[atomic spy]], caused the proposal to be dropped.{{sfn|Hewlett|Duncan|1969|pp=312\u2013314}} The June 1951 defection of [[Donald Maclean (spy)|Donald Maclean]], who had served as a British member of the Combined Policy Committee from January 1947 to August 1948, reinforced the Americans' distrust of British security arrangements.{{sfn|Botti|1987|pp=74\u201375}}\n\n=== Eisenhower administration ===\nThe first British atomic bomb was successfully tested in [[Western Australia]] in [[Operation Hurricane]] on 3 October 1952,{{sfn|Gowing|Arnold|1974b|pp=493\u2013495}}\nbut although it was more advanced than the American bombs of 1946, Britain was still several years behind in nuclear weapons technology.{{sfn|Gowing|Arnold|1974b|pp=474\u2013475}} On 1 November, the United States conducted [[Ivy Mike]], the first [[nuclear test]] of a true [[thermonuclear weapon|thermonuclear device]] (also known as a hydrogen bomb).{{sfn|Arnold|Pyne|2001|pp=16\u201320}} The JCAE saw little benefit for the United States from sharing technology with Britain.{{sfn|Arnold|Pyne|2001|pp=27\u201330}}{{sfn|Gowing|Arnold|1974b|pp=498\u2013500}} The [[Soviet Union]] responded to Ivy Mike with the test of [[Joe 4]], a [[boosted fission weapon]] on 12 August 1953.{{sfn|Arnold|Pyne|2001|pp=27\u201330}} This prompted President [[Dwight Eisenhower]], who was [[United States presidential inauguration|inaugurated]] in January 1953, to inform the [[United States Congress]] that the McMahon Act, which he considered a \"terrible piece of legislation\" and \"one of the most deplorable incidents in American history of which he personally felt ashamed\", was obsolete.{{sfn|Baylis|2008|pp=429\u2013430}}\n\n[[File:International Diplomacy.jpg|thumb|left|President [[Dwight D.

The United States would have to disclose their weights and dimensions, while their delivery would require data concerning their ballistics. Further down the track, there would also be issues of custody, security and targeting. The release of such information was restricted by the McMahon Act.{{sfn|Young|2016|pp=200\u2013201}}\n\nThis was amended on 30 August 1954 by the [[Atomic Energy Act of 1954]], which allowed for greater exchange of information with foreign nations,{{sfn|Botti|1987|pp=140\u2013141}} paving the way for the Agreement for Co-operation Regarding Atomic Information for Mutual Defence Purposes, which was signed on 15 June 1955.{{sfn|Botti|1987|pp=147\u2013149}} On 13 June 1956, another agreement was concluded, for the transfer of [[nuclear marine propulsion|nuclear submarine propulsion]] technology to Britain, saving the British government millions of pounds in research and development costs. This precipitated a row with the JCAE over whether this was permitted under the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, and whether Britain met the security standards set by the 1955 agreement. With the [[1956 United States presidential election|1956 presidential election]] approaching, Eisenhower was forced to rescind the offer.{{sfn|Botti|1987|pp=161\u2013164}}\n\nThe October 1956 [[Suez Crisis]] brought relations between Britain and the United States to a low ebb.{{sfn|Botti|1987|pp=171\u2013174}} When Eisenhower met with the new Prime Minister, [[Harold Macmillan]], in Bermuda in March 1957, he raised the possibility of basing US [[intermediate range ballistic missile]] (IRBM) systems in the UK.{{sfn|Botti|1987|pp=174\u2013177}} This came to be called [[Project Emily]].{{sfn|Young|2016|pp=98\u201399}} There were also discussions on exchanging nuclear submarine propulsion technology for information on the British [[Calder Hall]] [[nuclear power plant]], allowing the [[United Kingdom Atomic Energy Authority]] (UKAEA) to purchase uranium ore from Canada, and co-ordinating the war plans of [[RAF Bomber Command]] with those of the [[Strategic Air Command]].{{sfn|Botti|1987|pp=180\u2013181}}\n\nAlthough the IRBM negotiations pre-dated the Suez Crisis, it suited the British government to tout the IRBM deal as a demonstration that the rift had been healed.{{sfn|Young|2007|p=8}} The [[British hydrogen bomb programme]] attempted to detonate a [[thermonuclear device]] in the [[Operation Grapple]] test series at [[Kiritimati|Christmas Island]] in the Pacific.{{sfn|Baylis|1994|pp=166\u2013170}} The test series was facilitated by the United States, which also claimed the island.{{sfn|Botti|1987|pp=159\u2013160}} Although the first tests were unsuccessful,{{sfn|Arnold|Pyne|2001|p=147}} the Grapple X test on 8 November achieved the desired result.{{sfn|Baylis|1994|pp=166\u2013170}}{{sfn|Arnold|Pyne|2001|pp=160\u2013162}}\n\n==Negotiation==\n===Sputnik crisis===\n[[File:HD.3C.001 (13406014683).jpg|thumb|right|Eisenhower (left) lays the cornerstone for the new [[United States Atomic Energy Commission|Atomic Energy Commission]] (AEC) building in [[Germantown, Maryland]], on 8 November 1957.

The Soviet Union's launch of [[Sputnik 1]], the world's first [[artificial satellite]], on 4 October 1957, came as a tremendous shock to the American public, who had trusted that American technological superiority ensured their invulnerability. Now, suddenly, there was incontrovertible proof that, in some areas at least, the Soviet Union was actually ahead. In the widespread calls for action in response to the [[Sputnik crisis]], officials in the United States and Britain seized an opportunity to mend their relationship.{{sfn|Botti|1987|pp=199\u2013201}} At the suggestion of [[Harold Caccia, Baron Caccia|Harold Caccia]], the [[List of Ambassadors from the United Kingdom to the United States|British Ambassador to the United States]], Macmillan wrote to Eisenhower on 10 October urging that the two countries pool their resources,{{sfn|Arnold|Pyne|2001|p=199}} as Macmillan put it, to meet the Soviet challenge on every front, \"military, economic and political\".<ref>{{cite web |url=https://history.state.gov/historicaldocuments/frus1955-57v27/d306 |access-date=12 September 2017 |title=Foreign Relations of the United States, 1955\u20131957, Western Europe and Canada, Volume XXVII \u2013 Document 306  |publisher=Office of the Historian, United States Department of State }}</ref>\n\nMacmillan flew to Washington, DC, for talks on 25 October.{{sfn|Divine|1993|p=34}} He had concerns that the disastrous 10 October [[Windscale fire]] might prove a stumbling block in negotiations,{{sfn|Baylis|2008|p=438}} as it might reflect badly on British expertise and provide ammunition for opponents of closer co-operation with the UK.

Quarles]], the [[United States Deputy Secretary of Defense]], to consider how the deployment of IRBMs to Britain might be expedited.{{sfn|Divine|1993|p=34}} Another study group, under Strauss and Sir [[Edwin Plowden, Baron Plowden|Edwin Plowden]], the head of the UKAEA, would investigate nuclear co-operation and the exchange of nuclear information.{{sfn|Baylis|2008|p=438}} The personal relationship developed between Plowden and Strauss would be crucial in converting the latter over to the idea of providing information to Britain.{{sfn|Baylis|2008|p=440}}\n\nBy December, most of the issues with the IRBM negotiations had been ironed out,{{sfn|Baylis|2008|p=442}} and a formal agreement was drawn up on 17 December, although it was not until the end of the month that it was definitely determined that Britain would receive [[PGM-17 Thor|Thor]] and not [[PGM-19|Jupiter]] missiles.{{sfn|Wynn|1997|p=287}} However, the nuclear submarine propulsion effort was running into trouble. Under the July 1956 agreement and a February 1957 directive from Eisenhower, [[Royal Navy]] officers had been assigned to study the US Navy's nuclear submarine programme. By October 1957, its head, [[Rear Admiral (United States)|Rear Admiral]] [[Hyman G. Rickover]], felt that their questions were slowing the deployment of the [[UGM-27 Polaris|Polaris]] submarine-launched IRBM at a critical time. He feared that any delay might cause Congress to favour land-based missiles. By December, the British liaison officers were complaining of slow response to their questions. Rickover proposed that [[Westinghouse Electric Company|Westinghouse]] be permitted to sell the Royal Navy a nuclear submarine reactor, which would allow it to immediately proceed with building its own nuclear-powered submarine. The British government endorsed this idea, as it would save it a great deal of money.{{sfn|Botti|1987|p=203}}{{sfn|Baylis|2008|pp=441\u2013442}}\n\n===Amending the McMahon Act===\nFor their part, the British wanted the McMahon Act's restrictions on nuclear co-operation to be relaxed. They wanted to know the weight and dimensions, fusing and firing sequences, safety features, and in-flight procedures; the information that would allow American bombs to be carried in British [[V-bombers]], and American warheads to be fitted to British [[Blue Streak (missile)|Blue Streak]] missiles.{{sfn|Botti|1987|p=203}} This would potentially save millions of pounds and avoid domestic political complications if Britain had to persist with nuclear testing during an international moratorium.{{sfn|Baylis|2008|p=440}} While the British knew what they wanted, there was no consensus among the Americans as to what they wanted to provide.{{sfn|Botti|1987|p=203}} The [[United States Secretary of State]], [[John Foster Dulles]], was concerned that a special relationship with Britain might complicate the United States' relationships with its other allies.{{sfn|Baylis|2008|p=439}} Strauss in particular felt that a proposal to give hydrogen bomb secrets to the British would likely not get past the JCAE, and counselled drafting amendments that were sufficiently vague as to give the president the authority he needed without arousing its ire.{{sfn|Botti|1987|p=203}} Eisenhower declared that the US and UK were \"interdependent\", and pledged to ask Congress to amend the McMahon Act.{{sfn|Moore|2010|p=33}}\n\nCrucially, he managed to secure the support of [[Carl T. Durham]], the chairman of the JCAE. Eisenhower met with congressional leaders on 3 December 1957, and pressed for more discretion to co-operate with all America's [[NATO]] allies, and not just Britain.{{sfn|Botti|1987|pp=207\u2013208}} Indeed, the administration negotiated agreements with Australia, Canada and NATO.{{sfn|Botti|1987|p=214}} While Eisenhower did not yet have wholehearted support for the proposal, outright opposition from [[United States Senate|Senator]] [[Clinton Anderson]] failed to attract much support.{{sfn|Botti|1987|pp=207\u2013208}} On 27 January 1958, Strauss sent Durham the administration's proposed legislative changes,{{sfn|Botti|1987|p=214}} and the JCAE Subcommittee on Agreements for Cooperation, chaired by Senator [[John Pastore]], held hearings from 29 to 31 January. Quarles and [[Major General (United States)|Major General]] [[Herbert Loper]], the Assistant to the Secretary of Defense for Atomic Energy Affairs, were forced to deal with pointed questions about [[nuclear proliferation]].{{sfn|Botti|1987|pp=215\u2013219}} British information security, or the lack thereof, no longer seemed so important now that the Soviet Union was apparently ahead, and the United Kingdom had independently developed the hydrogen bomb,{{sfn|Botti|1987|pp=224\u2013225}} but the JCAE objected to the terms of the proposed deal to trade British uranium-235 for American [[plutonium]], under which the US would pay [[United States dollar|USD]] $30 per gram for plutonium that cost US$12 per gram to produce in the UK.{{sfn|Botti|1987|p=224}}\n\nThe amendments were passed by the [[United States House of Representatives|House of Representatives]] on 19 June, but not without changes. It now limited exchanges of nuclear weapons data to nations that had made substantial progress in the field. The same restriction applied to the actual transfer of non-nuclear components of nuclear weapons. American nuclear weapons were to remain under US custody and could only be turned over to allies in the event of war. The sale of nuclear reactors for submarines and nuclear fuel for them and other military reactors was permitted. Only Britain qualified as a nation that had made substantial progress.{{sfn|Botti|1987|pp=232\u2013233}} The bill passed Congress on 30 June 1958, and was signed into law by Eisenhower on 2 July 1958.{{sfn|Botti|1987|pp=234\u2013236}} The 1958 US\u2013UK Mutual Defence Agreement was signed by Dulles and [[Samuel Hood, 6th Viscount Hood|Samuel Hood]], the British Minister in Washington, DC, on 3 July,<ref name=\"full text\">{{cite web |url=http://www.nti.org/media/pdfs/56_4.pdf |title=Agreement between the Government of the United States of America and the Government of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland for Cooperation on the uses of Atomic Energy for Mutual Defence Purposes |publisher=Nuclear Threat Initiative |access-date=1 June 2017 }}</ref> and approved by Congress on 30 July.{{sfn|Botti|1987|p=238}}\n\n==Implementation==\n===Details of the agreement===\n[[File:Defense.gov photo essay 080709-D-7203C-008.jpg|thumb|left|UK Defence Minister [[Des Browne]] (right) addresses a reception hosted by US Defense Secretary [[Robert M.

In return, the British provided the details of seven of theirs, including [[Yellow Sun (nuclear weapon)#Green Grass|Green Grass]]; Pennant, the boosted device which had been detonated in the Grapple Z test on 22 August; Flagpole, the two-stage device scheduled for 2 September; Burgee, scheduled for 23 September; and the three-stage Halliard 3. The Americans were impressed with the British designs, particularly with Halliard 1, the heavier version of Halliard 3. Cook therefore changed the Grapple Z programme to fire Halliard 1 instead of Halliard 3.{{sfn|Arnold|Pyne|2001|pp=202\u2013205}} Macmillan noted in his diary, with satisfaction that:{{quote|in some respects we are as far, and even further, advanced in the art than our American friends.

The line of the road can be traced from surviving features, confirmed by archaeology, from Buxton as far as [[Longcliffe]] just north of [[Brassington]]. It is believed that from Brassington the road ran eastwards to [[Wirksworth]] and there joined another road which crossed the Derwent at Milford and ran on the east bank of the Derwent and can be traced to the northern suburbs of Derby to [[Derventio (Little Chester)|Little Chester]], the site of the Roman settlement of ''Derventio''. The 1723 map of Brassington Moor shows The Street road from Buxton through [[Pikehall]] up to the Upper Harborough Field Gate, leading onto Manystones Lane & Brassington Lane towards Wirksworth (probable site of the Roman town ''Lutudarum''). In records from 1613 the road from Brassington to Wirksworth is called 'Highe Streete'.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.wirksworthromanproject.co.uk/download/i/mark_dl/u/4012767328/4635968015/TheStreet3ed.pdf|title=The Street: A re-evaluation of the Roman road from Wirksworth to Buxton|last=Anton Shone and Dean Smart|first=|date=27 January 2019|website=Wirksworth Roman Project|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=8 April 2020}}</ref><ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|last=Hart|first=C R|title=The North Derbyshire Archaeological Survey|publisher=Derbyshire Archaeological Society|year=1984|isbn=|location=|pages=83-108}}</ref>\n\nThe Romans built farmsteads near the Street, to feed the soldiers and growing population in the area. Remains of a farm have been found near [[Minninglow]]. Excavations by Lomas at Minninglow in 1958 revealed the layered [[Agger (ancient Rome)|agger]] structure of the Roman road. The Street was recorded as 'Streete Way' in 1533 in the Bateman Manuscript, Chatsworth. On current OS maps there are many names related to The Street such as Street Farm, Street House Farm, Middle Street Farm and Straight (Street) Knolls Barn.

The line of the road can be traced from surviving features, confirmed by archaeology, from Buxton as far as [[Longcliffe]] just north of [[Brassington]]. It is believed that from Brassington the road ran eastwards to [[Wirksworth]] and there joined another road which crossed the Derwent at Milford and ran on the east bank of the Derwent and can be traced to the northern suburbs of Derby to [[Derventio (Little Chester)|Little Chester]], the site of the Roman settlement of ''Derventio''. The 1723 map of Brassington Moor shows The Street road from Buxton through [[Pikehall]] up to the Upper Harborough Field Gate, leading onto Manystones Lane & Brassington Lane towards Wirksworth (probable site of the Roman town ''Lutudarum''). In records from 1613 the road from Brassington to Wirksworth is called 'Highe Streete'.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.wirksworthromanproject.co.uk/download/i/mark_dl/u/4012767328/4635968015/TheStreet3ed.pdf|title=The Street: A re-evaluation of the Roman road from Wirksworth to Buxton|last=Anton Shone and Dean Smart|first=|date=27 January 2019|website=Wirksworth Roman Project|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=8 April 2020}}</ref><ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|last=Hart|first=C R|title=The North Derbyshire Archaeological Survey|publisher=Derbyshire Archaeological Society|year=1984|isbn=|location=|pages=83-108}}</ref>\n\nThe Romans built farmsteads near the Street, to feed the soldiers and growing population in the area.

[[10th Heavy Anti-Aircraft Regiment, Royal Artillery|10th AA Rgt]] was formed in December 1939 to command 9 and 19 AA Btys and train the AA Section of the new [[Gibraltar Defence Force]] (GDF), which took over the 3-inch guns. Apart from occasional shots fired at unidentified aircraft penetrating Gibraltar's airspace, there were no attacks on the fortress during the '[[Phoney war]]' period.<ref>Routledge, Table XI, p. 68; Table XIII, p. 69.</ref><ref name=\":0\">Routledge, pp. 200-4.</ref><ref name=\"RA39\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.ra39-45.pwp.blueyonder.co.uk/haa/page10.html|title=10 HAA Rgt at RA 39\u201345.|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110218082653/http://www.ra39-45.pwp.blueyonder.co.uk/haa/page10.html|archive-date=2011-02-18|access-date=2011-02-18}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.britishmilitaryhistory.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/124/2019/07/Gibraltar-Command-1939.pdf|title=Gibraltar Command Order of Battle (1939)|last=|first=|date=21 July 2019|website=britishmilitaryhistory.co.uk|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=4 February 2020}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://niehorster.org/017_britain/39_army/gibraltar.html|title=Gibraltar, 3 September 1939|last=|first=|date=4 December 2012|website=niehorster.org|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=4 February 2020}}</ref>\n\nAfter the [[Battle of France|Fall of France]], a group of AA detachments under [[53rd (City of London) Heavy Anti-Aircraft Regiment, Royal Artillery|53rd (City of London) AA Rgt]] escaped from [[Marseilles]] aboard the SS ''Alma Dawson''. A French dockyard strike prevented them from loading any of their 3-inch guns or vehicles, but they mounted Bofors guns on the ship's deck and put to sea on 18 June. On arrival in Gibraltar they reinforced 10th AA Rgt. 82nd (Essex) AA Regiment arrived on 27 June, and once it had unloaded its guns and equipment 53rd AA Rgt re-embarked for home.<ref name=\":0\" /><ref>53 HAA Regt War Diary 1940\u201341, [[The National Archives (United Kingdom)|The National Archives (TNA), Kew]], file WO 166/2343.</ref><ref name=\"Joslen552\">Joslen, pp. 552\u20133.</ref>\n\nThere followed a reorganisation of the AA units in Gibraltar: 19 AA Bty joined 82nd AA Rgt, together with the GDF HAA battery, while 9 AA Bty took over all the Bofors guns. A searchlight battery arrived, and an AA Operations Room (AAOR) was established to control all the gunsites and to coordinate with AA-equipped ships in the harbour. 10th AA Rgt HQ was ordered to be transferred to [[Malta]] in July, but this did not occur until November when, as part of [[Operation Coat]], a reinforcement convoy for Malta put in at Gibraltar and picked it up.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nThe first serious air raid on Gibraltar came at 02.00 on 18 July, when two unidentified aircraft bombed the slopes of the Rock, causing some fatalities. The attack was thought to be by the [[Vichy French Air Force]] in retaliation for the British attack on the French fleet at [[Mers-el-Kebir]] on 3 July ([[Attack on Mers-el-K\u00e9bir|Operation Catapult]]), which had been carried out by [[Force H]] from Gibraltar. On 21 August the AA defences brought down a [[Savoia-Marchetti SM.79]] bomber during a raid by the Italian ''[[Regia Aeronautica]]''. On 24 and 25 September waves of Vichy bombers attacked Gibraltar again in retaliation for the British and [[Free France|Free French]] attack on [[Dakar]] ([[Battle of Dakar|Operation Menace]]), and caused considerable damage. Several of these bombers were shot down by the combined AA fire. On other occasions the guns fired at single Italian reconnaissance aircraft, known to the garrison as 'Persistent Percy'.<ref name=\":0\" /><ref>Playfair, Vol I, pp. 130\u201337, 142.</ref><ref>Rankin, pp. 1\u20137.</ref><ref>Smith, pp. 57\u201388.</ref><ref name=\"Farn200\">Farndale, pp. 200\u20131.</ref><ref>Rankin, pp. 295\u20139.</ref>\n\n=== Formation ===\nDuring to the increase of raids and the coming [[North African Campaign]], the [[War Office]] (WO) approved the formation of a new AA Brigade which would handle the increasing demands brought on CRA, Gibraltar.  This new formation was to be known as the '''15th Anti-Aircraft Brigade''' (15th AA Bde) which was to take over all AA matters on the rock.

Equally important was the careful distribution of gun and radar positions to ensure the most effective converge from the increased firepower and the constant practice of day and night barrages, in which live firing was regularly employed and closely recorded, to eliminate errors and weak spots.  Aware of the vulnerability of positions to direct attack after opening fire, each AA position was given a 20mm Oerlikon for self-defence.  The basis of the plan for the revised layer was to bring the fire of 20 HAA gus to bear on a target travelling at 240 mph, approaching from any direction and at a typical height of 12,000 feet.<ref name=\":0\" /><ref name=\":1\" /><ref>Routledge, Map 12: The Defence of Gibraltar July 1940</ref>\n\nIn January 1942, the [[Governor of Gibraltar]], [[General]] the Viscount [[John Vereker, 6th Viscount Gort]] (Lord Gort) wrote to the [[War Office]] asking for more HAA guns, preferably [[QF 5.25-inch naval gun#Land service|5.25 inch heavy AA guns]], for GLII sets with semi-automatic plotters and another 8 x [[Bofors 40 mm gun]] (LAA guns).  Part of this request was due to 15th AA Brigade's wish to provide the [[Gibraltar International Airport|North airfield]] with its own LAA defence; hitherto it had depended on the main layout for coverage.  Nothing was sent, however, other than 3-inch rockets and their launchers and the airfield received only a small deployment of [[20 mm Polsten]] and [[Bofors 40 mm gun|Bofors 40 mm guns]] together with some machine-guns, all withdrawn from other positions, and three searchlights.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nDuring the whole of 1942 there were six bombing raids on Gibraltar, two of which were unidentified, and 18 reconnaissance overflights, all but two of them German. Four aircraft were shot down and others crash-landed in Spain. Some of the Italian raids missed their targets and dropped their bombs in Spanish territory, and Spanish AA guns sometimes opened fire as a raid passed towards them. By the end of 1942, the AA defences of Gibraltar reached a peak of scale and efficiency, but the threat had dwindled. There were only two or three reconnaissance flights during 1943.<ref name=\":0\" /><ref name=\"RA82\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.ra39-45.pwp.blueyonder.co.uk/haa/page45.html|title=82 HAA Rgt at RA 39\u201345|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110218063326/http://www.ra39-45.pwp.blueyonder.co.uk/haa/page45.html|archive-date=2011-02-18|access-date=2011-02-18}}</ref><ref name=\"Joslen5522\">Joslen, pp. 552\u20133.</ref>\n\n=== Later Years ===\nIt was [[War Office]] policy that army units should be replaced after three years' service overseas.

The brigade continued to serve as the prime AA defence formation until it was disbanded in 1944.\n\n== History ==\n[[File:3.7 inch anti-aircraft gun at Napier of Magdala Battery, Gibraltar.jpg|thumb|252x252px|3.7 inch anti-aircraft gun at Napier of Magdala Battery, Gibraltar|alt=|left]]\n=== Background ===\nOn the outbreak of war in September 1939 there had only been two batteries (9 and 19 AA Btys) manning the totally inadequate AA defences of Gibraltar, which consisted of four old 3-inch guns and four new 3.7-inch guns, spread in two-gun sections to give the widest possible coverage, and two of the new Bofors 40 mm guns to protect the [[Gibdock|Royal Navy Dockyard]], with the assistance of [[Royal Navy]] (RN) [[QF 2-pounder naval gun#QF%202-pounder%20Mark%20VIII|2-pounder pom-pom guns]]. [[10th Heavy Anti-Aircraft Regiment, Royal Artillery|10th AA Rgt]] was formed in December 1939 to command 9 and 19 AA Btys and train the AA Section of the new [[Gibraltar Defence Force]] (GDF), which took over the 3-inch guns. Apart from occasional shots fired at unidentified aircraft penetrating Gibraltar's airspace, there were no attacks on the fortress during the '[[Phoney war]]' period.<ref>Routledge, Table XI, p. 68; Table XIII, p. 69.</ref><ref name=\":0\">Routledge, pp. 200-4.</ref><ref name=\"RA39\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.ra39-45.pwp.blueyonder.co.uk/haa/page10.html|title=10 HAA Rgt at RA 39\u201345.|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110218082653/http://www.ra39-45.pwp.blueyonder.co.uk/haa/page10.html|archive-date=2011-02-18|access-date=2011-02-18}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.britishmilitaryhistory.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/124/2019/07/Gibraltar-Command-1939.pdf|title=Gibraltar Command Order of Battle (1939)|last=|first=|date=21 July 2019|website=britishmilitaryhistory.co.uk|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=4 February 2020}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://niehorster.org/017_britain/39_army/gibraltar.html|title=Gibraltar, 3 September 1939|last=|first=|date=4 December 2012|website=niehorster.org|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=4 February 2020}}</ref>\n\nAfter the [[Battle of France|Fall of France]], a group of AA detachments under [[53rd (City of London) Heavy Anti-Aircraft Regiment, Royal Artillery|53rd (City of London) AA Rgt]] escaped from [[Marseilles]] aboard the SS ''Alma Dawson''. A French dockyard strike prevented them from loading any of their 3-inch guns or vehicles, but they mounted Bofors guns on the ship's deck and put to sea on 18 June. On arrival in Gibraltar they reinforced 10th AA Rgt. 82nd (Essex) AA Regiment arrived on 27 June, and once it had unloaded its guns and equipment 53rd AA Rgt re-embarked for home.<ref name=\":0\" /><ref>53 HAA Regt War Diary 1940\u201341, [[The National Archives (United Kingdom)|The National Archives (TNA), Kew]], file WO 166/2343.</ref><ref name=\"Joslen552\">Joslen, pp. 552\u20133.</ref>\n\nThere followed a reorganisation of the AA units in Gibraltar: 19 AA Bty joined 82nd AA Rgt, together with the GDF HAA battery, while 9 AA Bty took over all the Bofors guns. A searchlight battery arrived, and an AA Operations Room (AAOR) was established to control all the gunsites and to coordinate with AA-equipped ships in the harbour. 10th AA Rgt HQ was ordered to be transferred to [[Malta]] in July, but this did not occur until November when, as part of [[Operation Coat]], a reinforcement convoy for Malta put in at Gibraltar and picked it up.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nThe first serious air raid on Gibraltar came at 02.00 on 18 July, when two unidentified aircraft bombed the slopes of the Rock, causing some fatalities. The attack was thought to be by the [[Vichy French Air Force]] in retaliation for the British attack on the French fleet at [[Mers-el-Kebir]] on 3 July ([[Attack on Mers-el-K\u00e9bir|Operation Catapult]]), which had been carried out by [[Force H]] from Gibraltar. On 21 August the AA defences brought down a [[Savoia-Marchetti SM.79]] bomber during a raid by the Italian ''[[Regia Aeronautica]]''. On 24 and 25 September waves of Vichy bombers attacked Gibraltar again in retaliation for the British and [[Free France|Free French]] attack on [[Dakar]] ([[Battle of Dakar|Operation Menace]]), and caused considerable damage. Several of these bombers were shot down by the combined AA fire. On other occasions the guns fired at single Italian reconnaissance aircraft, known to the garrison as 'Persistent Percy'.<ref name=\":0\" /><ref>Playfair, Vol I, pp. 130\u201337, 142.</ref><ref>Rankin, pp. 1\u20137.</ref><ref>Smith, pp. 57\u201388.</ref><ref name=\"Farn200\">Farndale, pp. 200\u20131.</ref><ref>Rankin, pp. 295\u20139.</ref>\n\n=== Formation ===\nDuring to the increase of raids and the coming [[North African Campaign]], the [[War Office]] (WO) approved the formation of a new AA Brigade which would handle the increasing demands brought on CRA, Gibraltar.  This new formation was to be known as the '''15th Anti-Aircraft Brigade''' (15th AA Bde) which was to take over all AA matters on the rock.  On 2 September 1941 the brigade was constituted with HQ based at [[RAF Gibraltar]].<ref name=\":0\" /><ref name=\":3\">Frederick, p. 1049.</ref><ref name=\":1\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.britishmilitaryhistory.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/124/2019/07/Gibraltar-Command-1942.pdf|title=Gibraltar Command Order of Battle (1942)|last=|first=|date=21 July 2019|website=britishmilitaryhistory.co.uk|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=4 February 2020}}</ref>[[File:Gibraltar during the Second World War GM4392.jpg|thumb|The [[Gibraltar Defence Force]] training on a 3.7-inch gun.]]\nThe brigade was then organised as;<ref name=\":1\" /><ref name=\":2\">Routledge, Table XXXIV: Page 212.</ref>\n\n* Brigade Headquarters under [[Brigadier]] [[Duncan Learmonth|Duncan Alexander Learmonth]]<ref group=\"Notes\">Assigned directly by the Governor of Gibraltar in September 1941</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.generals.dk/general/Learmont/Duncan_Alexander/Great_Britain.html|title=Learmont, Duncan Alexander|last=|first=|date=|website=generals.dk|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=4 February 2020}}</ref>\n* 142nd General Operation Post (Operations Room)\n*13th Heavy Anti-Aircraft Regiment, Royal Artillery (Regular, composite) \u2014 ''raised in [[Gibraltar]] with composite AA units based there, later disbanded on 10 December 1942''\n** RHQ\n** 288th HAA Bty \u2014 ''from [[94th Heavy Anti-Aircraft Regiment, Royal Artillery|94th HAA Regt, RA]]''\n**[[Z Battery|1st Rocket AA Troop]], [[Royal Artillery]] (AA Rockets)\n** 1st Radar Detection Finding Bty, RA\n*[[82nd (Essex) Heavy Anti-Aircraft Regiment, Royal Artillery]] (TA)\n** RHQ\n** 156th, 193rd, and 256th HAA Btys\n**[[Gibraltar Defence Force|Gibraltar Defence Force HAA Bty, RA]]\n*[[3rd Light Anti-Aircraft Regiment, Royal Artillery]] (Regular) \u2014 ''raised in [[Woolwich]] 2 September, arrived in [[Gibraltar]] on 27 September 1941''\n** RHQ\n** 9th, 114th, and 126th LAA Btys\n* 3rd Searchlight Bty, RA (Regular) \u2014 ''Formed 30 December 1939 in [[Gibraltar]], formally administered by the [[10th Heavy Anti-Aircraft Regiment, Royal Artillery|10th HAA Regt, RA]]''\n\n=== Gibraltar 'Blitz' ===\n[[File:The British Army on Gibraltar 1941 GM93.jpg|left|thumb|Mobile 3.7-inch HAA gun deployed at [[White Rock Battery]], November 1941.]]\n[[File:Searchlights on the Rock of Gibraltar, 1942.jpg|thumb|241x241px|Searchlights over [[Gibraltar]] during an air raid practice on 20 November 1942.]]\nAmong the many tasks facing 15th AA Brigade was the integration of AA fire in defence against sea or land invasion, in which it played an important part.  Equally important was the careful distribution of gun and radar positions to ensure the most effective converge from the increased firepower and the constant practice of day and night barrages, in which live firing was regularly employed and closely recorded, to eliminate errors and weak spots.  Aware of the vulnerability of positions to direct attack after opening fire, each AA position was given a 20mm Oerlikon for self-defence.  The basis of the plan for the revised layer was to bring the fire of 20 HAA gus to bear on a target travelling at 240 mph, approaching from any direction and at a typical height of 12,000 feet.<ref name=\":0\" /><ref name=\":1\" /><ref>Routledge, Map 12: The Defence of Gibraltar July 1940</ref>\n\nIn January 1942, the [[Governor of Gibraltar]], [[General]] the Viscount [[John Vereker, 6th Viscount Gort]] (Lord Gort) wrote to the [[War Office]] asking for more HAA guns, preferably [[QF 5.25-inch naval gun#Land service|5.25 inch heavy AA guns]], for GLII sets with semi-automatic plotters and another 8 x [[Bofors 40 mm gun]] (LAA guns).  Part of this request was due to 15th AA Brigade's wish to provide the [[Gibraltar International Airport|North airfield]] with its own LAA defence; hitherto it had depended on the main layout for coverage.  Nothing was sent, however, other than 3-inch rockets and their launchers and the airfield received only a small deployment of [[20 mm Polsten]] and [[Bofors 40 mm gun|Bofors 40 mm guns]] together with some machine-guns, all withdrawn from other positions, and three searchlights.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nDuring the whole of 1942 there were six bombing raids on Gibraltar, two of which were unidentified, and 18 reconnaissance overflights, all but two of them German. Four aircraft were shot down and others crash-landed in Spain. Some of the Italian raids missed their targets and dropped their bombs in Spanish territory, and Spanish AA guns sometimes opened fire as a raid passed towards them. By the end of 1942, the AA defences of Gibraltar reached a peak of scale and efficiency, but the threat had dwindled. There were only two or three reconnaissance flights during 1943.<ref name=\":0\" /><ref name=\"RA82\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.ra39-45.pwp.blueyonder.co.uk/haa/page45.html|title=82 HAA Rgt at RA 39\u201345|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110218063326/http://www.ra39-45.pwp.blueyonder.co.uk/haa/page45.html|archive-date=2011-02-18|access-date=2011-02-18}}</ref><ref name=\"Joslen5522\">Joslen, pp. 552\u20133.</ref>\n\n=== Later Years ===\nIt was [[War Office]] policy that army units should be replaced after three years' service overseas.
