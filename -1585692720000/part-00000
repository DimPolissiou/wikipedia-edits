The bill would also provide that if a person who is ineligible to vote becomes registered to vote by operation of this program, and that person votes or attempts to vote in an election held after the effective date of the person's registration, that person shall be presumed to have acted with official authorization and is not guilty of fraudulently voting or attempting to vote, unless that person willfully votes or attempts to vote knowing that he or she is not entitled to vote.\"\n</blockquote>\n\nThis specific wording is added to deal with California Probate Code Section 18100, as is noted later in the bill, describing good faith transactions with a trustee. {{cn span|date=January 2018|It is also unlikely to happen in the cases of non-US persons as it would mean the DMV trustee not documenting the lack of a US Citizenship document.{{original research inline|date=May 2018}}}}\n\n====San Francisco Proposition N====\nIn November 2016 voters in San Francisco approved a proposal to allow all parents of children in the San Francisco school system to vote in school board elections regardless of their immigration or citizenship status.<ref>Text of the proposal is [http://voterguide.sfelections.org/en/non-citizen-voting-school-board-elections here] and election results are [http://www.sfelections.org/results/20161108/ here] - scroll down to Local Measure N - Non-Citizen Voting in School Board Elections.</ref> Unless extended by the [[San Francisco Board of Supervisors]], the proposition is only effective for the school board elections of 2018, 2020, and 2022.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.latimes.com/nation/politics/trailguide/la-na-election-aftermath-updates-trail-san-francisco-measure-to-allow-1478692962-htmlstory.html|title=San Francisco measure to allow noncitizen parents to vote in school board elections leading|newspaper=[[Los Angeles Times]]|date=November 9, 2016|first=Rong-Gong|last=Lin II}}</ref> Voters rejected similar proposals in 2004 and 2010.<ref>[http://www.immigrantvoting.org/statescurrent/california.html Immigrant Voting Rights in California] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080705013348/http://www.immigrantvoting.org/statescurrent/california.html |date=July 5, 2008 }}</ref>\n\nCritics, such as Florida's Agriculture Commissioner [[Adam Putnam]], have used this proposition to generalize that noncitizens can vote in San Francisco.<ref>{{cite web|title=Can noncitizens vote in San Francisco, Takoma Park elections?|url=http://www.politifact.com/florida/statements/2017/sep/15/adam-putnam/san-francisco-takoma-park-noncitizens-elections/|publisher=[[politifact]]|date=September 15, 2017|first=Miriam|last=Valverde}}</ref> Former Congressmember [[Doug Ose]] has submitted a proposed ballot measure to state officials that would ban voting by those in the U.S. illegally.<ref>{{cite news|newspaper=[[Los Angeles Times]]|first=John|last=Myers|url=http://www.latimes.com/politics/essential/la-pol-ca-essential-politics-may-2018-former-gop-congressman-wants-an-official-1532575935-htmlstory.html#|title=Former GOP congressman wants an official ban on 'noncitizens' voting in California}}</ref>\n\nSan Francisco's effort to get noncitizen parents to the ballot box in mid-term elections in 2018 resulted in only 49 people signing up to vote.\n\n====Public calls for foreign suffrage====\nIn 2017 Joe Matthews, ''Connecting California'' columnist and California editor at Z\u00f3calo Public Square, an Ideas Exchange that is a project of New America and Arizona State University,<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.sfchronicle.com/author/joe-mathews/|title=Joe Mathews: Syndicated columnist|newspaper=The San Francisci Chronicle|accessdate=May 29, 2018}}</ref> called for universal suffrage.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.sacbee.com/opinion/california-forum/article165368987.html|title=You heard me, California: Give noncitizens the right to vote|date=August 4, 2017|newspaper=[[The Sacramento Bee]]|quote=U.S. Supreme Court precedent is unchanged; states can let noncitizens vote if they choose.
