The mill continued to operate until 1950. It was later purchased by the Herron Brothers, hence the name.\n\n==History==\nThe area around Herron's Mills, [[Lanark County]] was originally settled, starting in 1820, by Scottish immigrants from the southern areas of [[Scotland]]. Most of the Scottish who emigrated came from the over-crowded cities and areas in Scotland such as  [[Glasgow]] and [[Lanark]] the town in [[Lanarkshire]].<ref name=\"Custom Printers of Renfrew\"/>  As a result of the worldwide [[depression (economics)|depression]] that followed the [[Napoleonic Wars]] and the rapidly encroaching Industrial Revolution, Scottish weavers found themselves out of work and destitute.   Parliament heard the cry of the impoverished Scotsman, and forced colonization groups to assist those willing to emigrate to Canada.  Advertisements in Scottish papers read as follows: \"Persons desiring to emigrate to Canada will be conveyed free of charge. The government will also supply provisions on the voyage and on arrival, a grant of 100 acres will be allotted each family as well as to each male child on reaching 21.\" Promises of good conditions on the journey to Canada were also promised. Between 1820 and 1821 over 3,000 emigrants set sail to [[Canada]] and arrived in [[Lanark County]] via [[Quebec]], [[Cornwall, Ontario|Cornwall]] and [[Perth, Ontario|Perth]]. They named their new home the Lanark Highlands after their former home in Scotland.<ref name=\"Lanark Township Tour\">{{cite web|title=Lanark Township Tour|url=http://lanarkcountytourism.com/files/2012/02/Lanark-Township-Tour.pdf|website=Lanark Township Tourism|accessdate=17 September 2014}}</ref>\n\nHerron's Mills, was originally known as ''Gillies Mills''.<ref name=\"Custom Printers of Renfrew\">{{cite book|last1=Brown|first1=Howard Morton|title=Lanark Legacy: Nineteenth Century Glimpses of an Ontario County|url=https://books.google.com/?id=BNQNJ2x8ouUC&dq=Lanark+Legacy:+Nineteenth+Century+Glimpses+of+an+Ontario+County|date=1984|publisher=Custom Printers of Renfrew|location=Renfrew, Ontario|page=14|isbn=9781897113622}}</ref> The Gillies arrived in the area, that would be their namesake, in 1821 from Stirlingshire, Scotland. The family consisted of James(55), Helen Stark(43) and five of their six children: Janet(21), John(10), George(8), Helen(4) and Isabel(1).<ref name=\"Archives of Ontario\"/> In 1839, John married Mary Cullen Bain and then he began cutting timber in 1842 on the river Clyde using a sawmill that he had crafted with his own hands.  He carted the saw for the mill, from Brockville over 55 miles of rough, back-country roads to cut the timber that was harvested from his father's property.

Most of the Scottish who emigrated came from the over-crowded cities and areas in Scotland such as  [[Glasgow]] and [[Lanark]] the town in [[Lanarkshire]].<ref name=\"Custom Printers of Renfrew\"/>  As a result of the worldwide [[depression (economics)|depression]] that followed the [[Napoleonic Wars]] and the rapidly encroaching Industrial Revolution, Scottish weavers found themselves out of work and destitute.   Parliament heard the cry of the impoverished Scotsman, and forced colonization groups to assist those willing to emigrate to Canada.  Advertisements in Scottish papers read as follows: \"Persons desiring to emigrate to Canada will be conveyed free of charge. The government will also supply provisions on the voyage and on arrival, a grant of 100 acres will be allotted each family as well as to each male child on reaching 21.\" Promises of good conditions on the journey to Canada were also promised. Between 1820 and 1821 over 3,000 emigrants set sail to [[Canada]] and arrived in [[Lanark County]] via [[Quebec]], [[Cornwall, Ontario|Cornwall]] and [[Perth, Ontario|Perth]]. They named their new home the Lanark Highlands after their former home in Scotland.<ref name=\"Lanark Township Tour\">{{cite web|title=Lanark Township Tour|url=http://lanarkcountytourism.com/files/2012/02/Lanark-Township-Tour.pdf|website=Lanark Township Tourism|accessdate=17 September 2014}}</ref>\n\nHerron's Mills, was originally known as ''Gillies Mills''.<ref name=\"Custom Printers of Renfrew\">{{cite book|last1=Brown|first1=Howard Morton|title=Lanark Legacy: Nineteenth Century Glimpses of an Ontario County|url=https://books.google.com/?id=BNQNJ2x8ouUC&dq=Lanark+Legacy:+Nineteenth+Century+Glimpses+of+an+Ontario+County|date=1984|publisher=Custom Printers of Renfrew|location=Renfrew, Ontario|page=14|isbn=9781897113622}}</ref> The Gillies arrived in the area, that would be their namesake, in 1821 from Stirlingshire, Scotland.

Her birth name is different from her legal name. It must be in the lead and bolded.--> November 26, 1939) is a singer and actress, originally from the United States but now a Swiss citizen. Turner rose to prominence as part of the [[Ike & Tina Turner|Ike & Tina Turner Revue]] before launching a successful career as a solo performer. One of the [[List of best-selling music artists|best-selling recording artists of all time]], she has been referred to as [[Honorific nicknames in popular music|The Queen of Rock 'n' Roll]] and has sold more than 200 million records worldwide. Turner is noted for her energetic stage presence, powerful vocals, and career longevity.\n\nTurner began her career in 1958 as a featured singer with Ike Turner's [[Kings of Rhythm]], recording under the name \"Little Ann\" on \"[[Boxtop (song)|Boxtop]]\". Her introduction to the public as Tina Turner began with the hit single \"[[A Fool in Love]]\" (1960), released by the Ike & Tina Turner Revue. She married Ike Turner in 1962. Success followed with a string of notable hits, including \"[[River Deep \u2013 Mountain High]]\" (1966), the Grammy-winning \"[[Proud Mary]]\" (1971), and \"[[Nutbush City Limits]]\" (1973). Raised a [[Baptists|Baptist]], she became an adherent of [[Nichiren Buddhism]] in 1973, crediting the spiritual [[Buddhist chant|chant]] of ''[[Nam(u) My\u014dh\u014d Renge Ky\u014d|Nam Myoho Renge Kyo]]'' with helping her to endure during difficult times. Turner separated from Ike Turner in 1976, ending both their personal relationship and their musical partnership; the couple divorced in 1978. In her autobiography, ''[[I,&nbsp;Tina|I, Tina: My Life Story]]'' (1986), Turner revealed that Ike Turner had subjected her to [[domestic violence]].\n\nIn the 1980s, Turner launched a major comeback as a solo artist. The 1983 single \"[[Let's Stay Together (Al Green song)|Let's Stay Together]]\" was followed by the release of her fifth solo album, ''[[Private Dancer]]'' (1984), which became a worldwide success. The album contained the hit song \"[[What's Love Got to Do with It (song)|What's Love Got to Do with It]]\" (1984).

Her introduction to the public as Tina Turner began with the hit single \"[[A Fool in Love]]\" (1960), released by the Ike & Tina Turner Revue. She married Ike Turner in 1962. Success followed with a string of notable hits, including \"[[River Deep \u2013 Mountain High]]\" (1966), the Grammy-winning \"[[Proud Mary]]\" (1971), and \"[[Nutbush City Limits]]\" (1973).

Turner separated from Ike Turner in 1976, ending both their personal relationship and their musical partnership; the couple divorced in 1978.

The album contained the hit song \"[[What's Love Got to Do with It (song)|What's Love Got to Do with It]]\" (1984). Turner won the [[Grammy Award for Record Of The Year]] for the single, and it became her first (and only) No. 1 hit in the United States.

Her U.S. Top 10 hits from this period include \"[[Better Be Good to Me]]\" (1984), \"[[Private Dancer]]\" (1984), \"[[We Don't Need Another Hero (Thunderdome)]]\" (1985), \"[[Typical Male]]\" (1986), and \"[[I Don't Wanna Fight]]\" (1993). In 1993, ''[[What's Love Got to Do with It (film)|What's Love Got to Do with It]]'', a [[biographical film]] adapted from Turner's autobiography, was released along with an accompanying [[What's Love Got to Do with It (album)|soundtrack album]]. Turner also achieved success as an actress in films such as the 1975 [[rock musical]] ''[[Tommy (1975 film)|Tommy]]'', the 1985 action film ''[[Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome]]'', and the 1993 film ''[[Last Action Hero]]''.\n\nTurner has won 12 [[Grammy Award]]s; those awards include eight competitive awards, three [[Grammy Hall of Fame]] awards, and a [[Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award]].
