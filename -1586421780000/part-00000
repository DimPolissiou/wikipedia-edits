Located in the south-central part of the country, it has an area of {{convert|13,644.85|km2|abbr=on}}, and a population of 8,325,666 at the 2011 Census. It is bounded by [[Dhaka Division]] on the north, the [[Bay of Bengal]] on the south, [[Chittagong Division]] on the east and [[Khulna Division]] on the west. The administrative capital, [[Barishal]] city, lies in the [[Padma River]] delta on an offshoot of the [[Kirtankhola|Arial Khan River]]. Barishal division is criss-crossed by numerous rivers that earned it the nickname 'Dhan-Nodi-Khal, Ei tine [[Barishal|Borishal]]' (rice, river and canal built Barishal).\n\n== History ==\n\n=== Early Middle Ages ===\n\nIn early times the Barishal region was composed of an amalgamation of marshlands formed by the merging of islands brought into existence and built up by alluvial soils washed down the great channels of the combined [[Brahmaputra]]-[[Ganges]]-[[Meghna]] river systems.\n\n\nIn the early 13th century, [[Muhammad bin Bakhtiyar Khalji]] led the Muslim conquest of Barishal, and soon later [[Muhammad bin Tughluq]] completely conquered [[east Bengal|eastern Bengal]]. The [[Hindu]] chieftains from northwest [[Bengal]] were dislodged from power and they dispersed over Barishal region and founded the kingdom of Bakla.{{citation needed|date=November 2016}}\n\nDuring the [[Mughal Empire|Mughal]] intervention in [[Bengal]], Hindu society was concentrated to northern and western Barishal (known as [[Backergunje|Bakarganj]]). Barishal's southern portion was still covered by forests and laced with lagoons. The northwest was also the only part of Bakarganj where the [[Hindu]] population exceeded [[Muslims]] in early British censuses.{{citation needed|date=November 2016}}\n\n===Mughal period===\n\nBarishal saw a second wave of immigration in the late 17th and early 18th centuries. This time, it was [[Muslim]] pioneers who assumed the leading role. Establishing [[Dhaka]] as the provincial [[Mughal Empire|Mughal]] capital of the region, in the early 17th century the Barishal region (known as Sarkar Bakla to Mughals) was more accessible to businessmen and developers than at any previous time. However, piracy in this region along the coasts and rivers of southeastern Bengal by [[Arakanese people|Arakanese]] and renegade [[Portugal|Portuguese]] seamen inhibited any sustained attempts by Mughal governors to push into the Barishal forests.\n\nAfter 1666, when [[Mughal Empire|Mughal]] naval forces cleared the [[Meghna]] [[estuary]] of such external threats, the Barishal interior lay ripe for colonization. Land developers acquired grants of plots of land, [[taluq]] (\u09a4\u09be\u09b2\u09c1\u0995), from provincial authorities. Abundant and easily obtainable by purchase from the late 17th century these grants tended to be regarded by their possessors [[taluqdar]] (\u09a4\u09be\u09b2\u09c1\u0995\u09a6\u09be\u09b0).  As [[taluqdar]]s brought their [[taluq]]s into [[agricultural]] production, these men passed up the [[Land (economics)|land]] [[revenue]] through a class of non-cultivating intermediaries, or zamindar (\u099c\u09ae\u09bf\u09a6\u09be\u09b0).  Zamindars typically resided in the provincial capital, where they had ready access to the chief provincial revenue officer, or dewan (\u09a6\u09c7\u0993\u09af\u09bc\u09be\u09a8).\n\nIn a second pattern of land development, [[Muslim]] [[Pir (Sufism)|pirs]] or [[Qazi]] went directly into uncultivated regions, organized the local population for clearing the jungles, and only later, after having established themselves as local men of influence, entered into relations with the [[Mughal Empire|Mughal]] authorities. Relationships between the religious Muslim [[Pir (Sufism)|pirs]] and Mughal authorities was not always harmonious, since a pir's natural ties of authority and patronage generally lay with the masses of peasants beneath him and not with the governors and bureaucrats. For example, in remote [[Jhalakati]] Thana in the eastern [[Backergunje|Bakarganj]], an 18th-century pir named Saiyid Faqir wielded enormous influence with the cultivators of the all-Muslim village of Saiyidpur, named after the pir. But a difficulty arose, noted a 1906 village survey, because \"the people of this part looked upon the Fakir as their guide and did not pay rent to the [[Nawab]].\" In this situation, one Lala Chet Singh, a captain in the employ of the governor, \"succeeded in persuading the Fakir to leave the country.\"\n\n=== British rule ===\n\nIn 1797 the area was established as [[Bakerganj District]] but later renamed as Barishal District.\n\n=== Pakistani rule ===\n\nIn 1947 the area was continued as a [[Bakerganj District]], as one of four districts of [[Khulna Division]] but later renamed as Barishal District.\n\n=== Bangladesh ===\n\nThe Greater Barishal region (Barishal District along with five other neighbouring districts) was created as Barishal Division on 1 January 1993.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.escholarship.org/editions/view?docId=ft067n99v9&chunk.id=s1.8.3&toc.depth=1&toc.id=ch08&brand=eschol |title=The Rise of Islam and the Bengal Frontier, 1204\u20131760 |publisher=Escholarship.org |date= |accessdate=2013-02-15}}</ref>\n\n== Economy ==\nBarishal was once known as the \"Granary of Bengal\" for its rice production. It is still an important rice-producing area of the country. Since the Middle Ages, Barishal has acted as a trans-shipment center for hides, rice, dried beans, dried peas, lentils, chickpeas, and other [[legume]]s for Bengal. Bakery, textile, and pharmaceutical products are the output of a few industrial installations.  There are [[Sher-e Bangla Medical College]] (affiliated with the National University) and [[Brojomohun College|B. M. College]] (an educational institution of Barishal Division established in 1889). Barishal is also a river port once connecting Calcutta-Barishal-Dhaka and many other routes. Today Barishal River port is the most important hub of steamer and motor launch service of the Southern Bangladesh.\n\n== Points of interest ==\n[[Image:Sunrise in Kuakata.jpg|thumb|Sunrise at Kuakata sea beach, Barishal]]\n[[Kuakata]] beach is the main tourist spot in the division. It is one of the two sea beaches in [[South Asia]] where both sunrise and sunset at sea can be seen.{{clarify|date=March 2019}}{{citation needed|date=March 2019}}\n\n[[Durga Sagar]] is a man-made pond where a number of migratory birds arrive every winter.\n\n[[Guthia Mosque]] is a mosque complex of Bangladesh having a land area of {{convert|14|acre|ha|order=flip}}, comparing to the {{convert|8.30|acre|ha|order=flip|abbr=on}} land area of the national mosque Baitul Mukarram of the country.\n\n==Administration==\n\nThe division is subdivided into six districts (zilas) and thence into 42 sub-districts ([[Upazilas of Bangladesh|upazilas]]; Rangabali in Patuakhali and Taltoli in Barguna being the most recent). Lower level administrative areas are 353 [[Union Councils of Bangladesh|union parishads]], 3,159 [[mouzas]], 12 [[Paurashava|municipalities]], 25 [[Wards of Bangladesh|wards]] and 4,163 villages.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"margin-bottom: 0;\"\n|-\n!

Located in the south-central part of the country, it has an area of {{convert|13,644.85|km2|abbr=on}}, and a population of 8,325,666 at the 2011 Census. It is bounded by [[Dhaka Division]] on the north, the [[Bay of Bengal]] on the south, [[Chittagong Division]] on the east and [[Khulna Division]] on the west. The administrative capital, [[Barisal]] city, lies in the [[Padma River]] delta on an offshoot of the [[Kirtankhola|Arial Khan River]]. Barisal division is criss-crossed by numerous rivers that earned it the nickname 'Dhan-Nodi-Khal, Ei tine [[Barisal|Borishal]]' (rice, river and canal built Barisal).\n\n== History ==\n\n=== Early Middle Ages ===\n\nIn early times the Barisal region was composed of an amalgamation of marshlands formed by the merging of islands brought into existence and built up by alluvial soils washed down the great channels of the combined [[Brahmaputra]]-[[Ganges]]-[[Meghna]] river systems.\n\n\nIn the early 13th century, [[Muhammad bin Bakhtiyar Khalji]] led the Muslim conquest of Barisal, and soon later [[Muhammad bin Tughluq]] completely conquered [[east Bengal|eastern Bengal]]. The [[Hindu]] chieftains from northwest [[Bengal]] were dislodged from power and they dispersed over Barisal region and founded the kingdom of Bakla.{{citation needed|date=November 2016}}\n\nDuring the [[Mughal Empire|Mughal]] intervention in [[Bengal]], Hindu society was concentrated to northern and western Barisal (known as [[Backergunje|Bakarganj]]). Barisal's southern portion was still covered by forests and laced with lagoons. The northwest was also the only part of Bakarganj where the [[Hindu]] population exceeded [[Muslims]] in early British censuses.{{citation needed|date=November 2016}}\n\n===Mughal period===\n\nBarisal saw a second wave of immigration in the late 17th and early 18th centuries. This time, it was [[Muslim]] pioneers who assumed the leading role. Establishing [[Dhaka]] as the provincial [[Mughal Empire|Mughal]] capital of the region, in the early 17th century the Barisal region (known as Sarkar Bakla to Mughals) was more accessible to businessmen and developers than at any previous time. However, piracy in this region along the coasts and rivers of southeastern Bengal by [[Arakanese people|Arakanese]] and renegade [[Portugal|Portuguese]] seamen inhibited any sustained attempts by Mughal governors to push into the Barisal forests.\n\nAfter 1666, when [[Mughal Empire|Mughal]] naval forces cleared the [[Meghna]] [[estuary]] of such external threats, the Barisal interior lay ripe for colonization. Land developers acquired grants of plots of land, [[taluq]] (\u09a4\u09be\u09b2\u09c1\u0995), from provincial authorities. Abundant and easily obtainable by purchase from the late 17th century these grants tended to be regarded by their possessors [[taluqdar]] (\u09a4\u09be\u09b2\u09c1\u0995\u09a6\u09be\u09b0).  As [[taluqdar]]s brought their [[taluq]]s into [[agricultural]] production, these men passed up the [[Land (economics)|land]] [[revenue]] through a class of non-cultivating intermediaries, or zamindar (\u099c\u09ae\u09bf\u09a6\u09be\u09b0).  Zamindars typically resided in the provincial capital, where they had ready access to the chief provincial revenue officer, or dewan (\u09a6\u09c7\u0993\u09af\u09bc\u09be\u09a8).\n\nIn a second pattern of land development, [[Muslim]] [[Pir (Sufism)|pirs]] or [[Qazi]] went directly into uncultivated regions, organized the local population for clearing the jungles, and only later, after having established themselves as local men of influence, entered into relations with the [[Mughal Empire|Mughal]] authorities. Relationships between the religious Muslim [[Pir (Sufism)|pirs]] and Mughal authorities was not always harmonious, since a pir's natural ties of authority and patronage generally lay with the masses of peasants beneath him and not with the governors and bureaucrats. For example, in remote [[Jhalakati]] Thana in the eastern [[Backergunje|Bakarganj]], an 18th-century pir named Saiyid Faqir wielded enormous influence with the cultivators of the all-Muslim village of Saiyidpur, named after the pir. But a difficulty arose, noted a 1906 village survey, because \"the people of this part looked upon the Fakir as their guide and did not pay rent to the [[Nawab]].\" In this situation, one Lala Chet Singh, a captain in the employ of the governor, \"succeeded in persuading the Fakir to leave the country.\"\n\n=== British rule ===\n\nIn 1797 the area was established as [[Bakerganj District]] but later renamed as Barisal District.\n\n=== Pakistani rule ===\n\nIn 1947 the area was continued as a [[Bakerganj District]], as one of four districts of [[Khulna Division]] but later renamed as Barisal District.\n\n=== Bangladesh ===\n\nThe Greater Barisal region (Barisal District along with five other neighbouring districts) was created as Barisal Division on 1 January 1993.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.escholarship.org/editions/view?docId=ft067n99v9&chunk.id=s1.8.3&toc.depth=1&toc.id=ch08&brand=eschol |title=The Rise of Islam and the Bengal Frontier, 1204\u20131760 |publisher=Escholarship.org |date= |accessdate=2013-02-15}}</ref>\n\n== Economy ==\nBarisal was once known as the \"Granary of Bengal\" for its rice production. It is still an important rice-producing area of the country. Since the Middle Ages, Barisal has acted as a trans-shipment center for hides, rice, dried beans, dried peas, lentils, chickpeas, and other [[legume]]s for Bengal. Bakery, textile, and pharmaceutical products are the output of a few industrial installations.  There are [[Sher-e Bangla Medical College]] (affiliated with the National University) and [[Brojomohun College|B. M. College]] (an educational institution of Barisal Division established in 1889). Barisal is also a river port once connecting Calcutta-Barisal-Dhaka and many other routes. Today Barisal River port is the most important hub of steamer and motor launch service of the Southern Bangladesh.\n\n== Points of interest ==\n[[Image:Sunrise in Kuakata.jpg|thumb|Sunrise at Kuakata sea beach, Barisal]]\n[[Kuakata]] beach is the main tourist spot in the division.

Lower level administrative areas are 353 [[Union Councils of Bangladesh|union parishads]], 3,159 [[mouzas]], 12 [[Paurashava|municipalities]], 25 [[Wards of Bangladesh|wards]] and 4,163 villages.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"margin-bottom: 0;\"\n|-\n!

After some problems at the production, Vergina Beer finally managed to release on [[February 18|February 18th]],[[1998]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070918085412/http://tovima.dolnet.gr/print_article.php?e=B&f=14867&m=A10&aa=1|title=\u03a4\u03bf \u0392\u0397\u039c\u0391 onLine - \u03a1\u0395\u03a0\u039f\u03a1\u03a4\u0391\u0396|date=2007-09-18|website=web.archive.org|access-date=2020-04-09}}</ref> Some of the difficulties occurred caused by the unfair competition tactics for which '''Athenian Brewery''',a [[Heineken N.V.|Heineken]] subsidiary company, later was found guilty by the court, but had already damaged the growth of the company.<ref>{{Cite news|last=Jr|first=Landon Thomas|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/12/12/business/dealbook/in-greece-brewers-woes-reflect-struggle-of-business-owners.html|title=In Greece, Brewer\u2019s Woes Reflect Struggle of Business Owners|date=2015-12-11|work=The New York Times|access-date=2020-04-09|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.xronos.gr/epikairotita/megali-dikastiki-niki-tis-vergina|title=\u039c\u03b5\u03b3\u03ac\u03bb\u03b7 \u03b4\u03b9\u03ba\u03b1\u03c3\u03c4\u03b9\u03ba\u03ae \u03bd\u03af\u03ba\u03b7 \u03c4\u03b7\u03c2 \"\u0392\u03b5\u03c1\u03b3\u03af\u03bd\u03b1\"|website=www.xronos.gr|language=el|access-date=2020-04-08}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://drinksint.com/news/fullstory.php/aid/7610/Heineken_loses_legal_battle_in_Greece.html|title=Heineken loses legal battle in Greece - Drinks International - The global choice for drinks buyers|website=drinksint.com|access-date=2020-04-09}}</ref> \n\n====== Contract Farming of malting barley ======\nIn [[2006]] the company introduced Greek market to the [[contract farming]] of malting barley, contracting with farmers in [[Macedonia (Greece)|Macedonia]] and [[Western Thrace|Thrace]].\n\n====== Tuvunu Establishement ======\nIn [[2012]] the brewery founded '''Tuvunu S.A.''', a company producing the homonym Green Tea and Sparkling Water, operating in tandem with the brewery facilities and also makes use of a [[contract farming]] program.<ref name=\":1\" /><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.tuvunu.com/index.php/tvunu-news/item/4-\u03c9\u03c1\u03b1-\u03b3\u03b9\u03b1-\u03c4\u03c3\u03ac\u03b9-tuvunu?lang=el|title=Tuvunu - \u03a9\u03c1\u03b1 \u03b3\u03b9\u03b1 \u03c4\u03c3\u03ac\u03b9 Tuvunu|website=www.tuvunu.com|language=el-gr|access-date=2020-04-09}}</ref> \n\n====== Launch of Malting Plant & Thracian Malt ======\nIn [[2014]] the company launched its own malting plant and claims it's \"Greece\u2019s first Greek owned malting facility and one of the world\u2019s most technologically advanced\".

It is the highest [[association football|football]] league in Denmark and is currently contested by 14 teams each year, with 1\u20133 teams relegated.\n\n==History==\nFounded in 1991, the Danish Superliga replaced the [[Danish 1st Division]] as the highest league of [[football in Denmark]]. From the start in 1991, 10 teams were participating. The opening Superliga season was played during the spring of 1991, with the ten teams playing each other twice for the championship title. From the summer of 1991, the tournament structure would stretch over two years. The 10 teams would play each other twice in the first half of the tournament. In the following spring, the bottom two teams would be cut off, the points of the teams would be cut in half, and the remaining eight teams would once more play each other twice, for a total of 32 games in a season.\n\nThis practice was abandoned before the [[1995\u201396 Danish Superliga|1995\u201396 season]], when the number of teams competing was increased to 12, playing each other thrice for 33 games per Superliga season. For the first season of this new structure, [[Coca-Cola]] became the name sponsor of the league, which was then named ''Coca-Cola Ligaen''. After a single season under that name, [[Faxe Brewery]] became sponsors and the league changed its name to ''[[Faxe Kondi]] Ligaen''. Before the [[2001\u201302 Danish Superliga|2001\u201302 season]], Scandinavian Airlines System (SAS) became the head sponsor, and the name of the tournament changed to ''SAS Ligaen''. From January 2015 the Danish Superliga is known as ''Alka Superliga'', as the Danish insurance company [[Alka (insurance)|Alka]] became name sponsor.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dr.dk/Sporten/Fodbold/Superliga/2014/10/28/1028115131.htm|title=Officielt: Superligaen bliver til Alka Superligaen|publisher=}}</ref>\n\nLogos used for naming rights agreements for the league:\n<gallery widths=\"170px\">\nFile:Coca-Cola Ligaen 1995.jpg | '''Coca-Cola Ligaen'''<br />(1995\u201396)<br />Sponsor: [[Coca-Cola]]\nFile:Faxe Kondi Ligaen.png | '''Faxe Kondi Ligaen'''<br />(1996\u201397 until 2000\u201301)<br />Sponsor: [[Faxe Brewery]]\nFile:SAS Ligaen logo.svg | '''SAS Ligaen'''<br />(2001\u201302 until 2009\u201310)<br />Sponsor: [[Scandinavian Airlines|SAS]]\nFile:Superliga 2010.svg | '''Superligaen'''<br />(2010\u201311 until 31 Dec 2014)<br />No league sponsor\nFile:Alka Superliga (2015).svg | '''Alka Superliga'''<br />(1 Jan 2015 until 2017\u201318)<br />Sponsor: [[Alka (insurance)|Alka]]\nFile:Superliga 2010.svg | '''Superligaen'''<br />2018\u201319<br />No league sponsor\nFile:3F_Superliga_Logo.jpg | '''3F Superliga'''<br />(Since 2019\u201320)<br />Sponsor: [[Fagligt F\u00e6lles Forbund]]\n</gallery>\n\n==Structure==\nFrom 1996 through 2016, the league included 12 clubs which played each other three times. The two teams with the fewest points at the end of the season were relegated to the [[Danish 1st Division]] and replaced by the top two teams of that division. During this era, each team played every other team at least once at home and once away plus once more either at home or away. The top six teams of the previous season played 17 matches at home and 16 away while the teams in 7th to 10th place plus the two newly promoted teams played 16 matches at home and 17 away.\n\nFollowing the 2015\u201316 season, the league was expanded to 14 teams, accomplished by relegating only the last-place finisher in that season and promoting the top three teams from the 1st division. The 2016\u201317 season was the first for the new league structure. It began with the teams playing a full home-and-away schedule, resulting in 26 matches for each team. At that time, the league split into a six-team championship playoff and an eight-team qualifying playoff. All teams' table points and goals carry over fully into the playoffs.\n\nIn the championship playoff, each team plays the others home and away again. The top team at the end of the playoff is Superliga champion and enters the [[UEFA Champions League|Champions League]] in the second qualifying round. The second-place team enters the [[UEFA Europa League|Europa League]] in the first qualifying round. The third-place team advances to a one-off playoff match for another Europa League place. If the winner of the [[Danish Cup]] finishes in the top three, the match will instead involve the fourth-place team.\n\nThe qualifying playoff is split into two groups, with the teams that finished the regular season in 7th, 10th, 11th, and 14th in one group and those finishing 8th, 9th, 12th, and 13th in the other. Each group plays home-and-away within its group. The top two teams from each group then enter a knockout tournament, with each match over two legs. If the Danish Cup winner is among the top two finishers in either playoff group, it is withdrawn from the knockout playoff and its opponent automatically advances to the tournament final. The winner of that tournament faces the third-place (or fourth-place) team from the championship playoff in a one-off match, with the winner entering the Europa League in the first qualifying round.\n\nThe bottom two teams from each group then contest a relegation playoff with several steps, centered on a separate four-team knockout playoff, also consisting totally of two-legged matches:\n* The third-placed teams in each group play over two legs, with the winners remaining in the Superliga and the losers advancing to a play-off final against the third-place team from the 1st Division.\n* The bottom teams in each group play over two legs, with the winners advancing to a play-off final against the second-place team from the 1st Division, and the losers dropping to next season's 1st Division.\n* The winners of each play-off final play in the next season's Superliga.\n\n==Seasons==\n\n===Current teams (2019\u201320)===\n{{location map+ |Denmark |float=right |width=425 |caption=Locations of teams in the 2019\u201320 Danish Superliga |alt=Locations of teams in the 2019\u201320 Danish Superliga |places=\n{{location map~ |Denmark |lat=57.0515   |long=9.8991    |label=[[Aalborg Boldspilklub|AaB]]|position=right}}\n{{location map~ |Denmark |lat=55.871555 |long=9.857161  |label=[[AC Horsens]]|position=right}}\n{{location map~ |Denmark |lat=56.131944 |long=10.196389 |label=[[Aarhus Gymnastikforening|AGF]]|position=right}}\n{{location map~ |Denmark |lat=55.648839 |long=12.418517 |label=[[Br\u00f8ndby IF]]|position=left}}\n{{location map~ |Denmark |lat=55.702469 |long=12.572203 |label=<!--Copenhagen-->}}\n{{location map~ |Denmark |lat=55.481985 |long=8.43941   |label=[[Esbjerg fB]]|position=bottom}}\n{{location map~ |Denmark |lat=56.638758 |long=9.798421  |label=[[Hobro IK]]|position=left}}\n{{location map~ |Denmark |lat=55.781142  |long=12.505791  |label=[[Lyngby Boldklub|Lyngby]]|position=right}}\n{{location map~ |Denmark |lat=56.116868 |long=8.951669  |label=[[FC Midtjylland|FC&nbsp;Midtjylland]]|position=bottom}}\n{{location map~ |Denmark |lat=55.815847 |long=12.353289 |label=[[FC Nordsj\u00e6lland|FC&nbsp;Nordsj\u00e6lland]]|position=top}}\n{{location map~ |Denmark |lat=55.397771 |long=10.350055 |label=[[Odense Boldklub|OB]]|position=right}}\n{{location map~ |Denmark |lat=56.46594  |long=10.010262 |label=[[Randers FC]]|position=right}}\n{{location map~ |Denmark |lat=56.184284 |long=9.575669  |label=[[Silkeborg IF|Silkeborg]]|position=top}}\n{{location map~ |Denmark |lat=55.261359 |long=9.487791  |label=[[S\u00f8nderjyskE Fodbold|S\u00f8nderjyskE]]|position=bottom}}\n<!-- DISPLAY FIX FOR COPENHAGEN -->\n{{location map~ |Denmark |mark=TransparentPlaceholder.png|lat=55.6 |long=12.572203 |label=[[F.C.

From the start in 1991, 10 teams were participating. The opening Superliga season was played during the spring of 1991, with the ten teams playing each other twice for the championship title. From the summer of 1991, the tournament structure would stretch over two years. The 10 teams would play each other twice in the first half of the tournament. In the following spring, the bottom two teams would be cut off, the points of the teams would be cut in half, and the remaining eight teams would once more play each other twice, for a total of 32 games in a season.\n\nThis practice was abandoned before the [[1995\u201396 Danish Superliga|1995\u201396 season]], when the number of teams competing was increased to 12, playing each other thrice for 33 games per Superliga season. For the first season of this new structure, [[Coca-Cola]] became the name sponsor of the league, which was then named ''Coca-Cola Ligaen''. After a single season under that name, [[Faxe Brewery]] became sponsors and the league changed its name to ''[[Faxe Kondi]] Ligaen''. Before the [[2001\u201302 Danish Superliga|2001\u201302 season]], Scandinavian Airlines System (SAS) became the head sponsor, and the name of the tournament changed to ''SAS Ligaen''. From January 2015 the Danish Superliga is known as ''Alka Superliga'', as the Danish insurance company [[Alka (insurance)|Alka]] became name sponsor.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dr.dk/Sporten/Fodbold/Superliga/2014/10/28/1028115131.htm|title=Officielt: Superligaen bliver til Alka Superligaen|publisher=}}</ref>\n\nLogos used for naming rights agreements for the league:\n<gallery widths=\"170px\">\nFile:Coca-Cola Ligaen 1995.jpg | '''Coca-Cola Ligaen'''<br />(1995\u201396)<br />Sponsor: [[Coca-Cola]]\nFile:Faxe Kondi Ligaen.png | '''Faxe Kondi Ligaen'''<br />(1996\u201397 until 2000\u201301)<br />Sponsor: [[Faxe Brewery]]\nFile:SAS Ligaen logo.svg | '''SAS Ligaen'''<br />(2001\u201302 until 2009\u201310)<br />Sponsor: [[Scandinavian Airlines|SAS]]\nFile:Superliga 2010.svg | '''Superligaen'''<br />(2010\u201311 until 31 Dec 2014)<br />No league sponsor\nFile:Alka Superliga (2015).svg | '''Alka Superliga'''<br />(1 Jan 2015 until 2017\u201318)<br />Sponsor: [[Alka (insurance)|Alka]]\nFile:Superliga 2010.svg | '''Superligaen'''<br />2018\u201319<br />No league sponsor\nFile:3F_Superliga_Logo.jpg | '''3F Superliga'''<br />(Since 2019\u201320)<br />Sponsor: [[Fagligt F\u00e6lles Forbund]]\n</gallery>\n\n==Structure==\nFrom 1996 through 2016, the league included 12 clubs which played each other three times. The two teams with the fewest points at the end of the season were relegated to the [[Danish 1st Division]] and replaced by the top two teams of that division. During this era, each team played every other team at least once at home and once away plus once more either at home or away. The top six teams of the previous season played 17 matches at home and 16 away while the teams in 7th to 10th place plus the two newly promoted teams played 16 matches at home and 17 away.\n\nFollowing the 2015\u201316 season, the league was expanded to 14 teams, accomplished by relegating only the last-place finisher in that season and promoting the top three teams from the 1st division. The 2016\u201317 season was the first for the new league structure. It began with the teams playing a full home-and-away schedule, resulting in 26 matches for each team. At that time, the league split into a six-team championship playoff and an eight-team qualifying playoff. All teams' table points and goals carry over fully into the playoffs.\n\nIn the championship playoff, each team plays the others home and away again. The top team at the end of the playoff is Superliga champion and enters the [[UEFA Champions League|Champions League]] in the second qualifying round. The second-place team enters the [[UEFA Europa League|Europa League]] in the first qualifying round. The third-place team advances to a one-off playoff match for another Europa League place. If the winner of the [[Danish Cup]] finishes in the top three, the match will instead involve the fourth-place team.\n\nThe qualifying playoff is split into two groups, with the teams that finished the regular season in 7th, 10th, 11th, and 14th in one group and those finishing 8th, 9th, 12th, and 13th in the other. Each group plays home-and-away within its group. The top two teams from each group then enter a knockout tournament, with each match over two legs. If the Danish Cup winner is among the top two finishers in either playoff group, it is withdrawn from the knockout playoff and its opponent automatically advances to the tournament final. The winner of that tournament faces the third-place (or fourth-place) team from the championship playoff in a one-off match, with the winner entering the Europa League in the first qualifying round.\n\nThe bottom two teams from each group then contest a relegation playoff with several steps, centered on a separate four-team knockout playoff, also consisting totally of two-legged matches:\n* The third-placed teams in each group play over two legs, with the winners remaining in the Superliga and the losers advancing to a play-off final against the third-place team from the 1st Division.\n* The bottom teams in each group play over two legs, with the winners advancing to a play-off final against the second-place team from the 1st Division, and the losers dropping to next season's 1st Division.\n* The winners of each play-off final play in the next season's Superliga.\n\n==Seasons==\n\n===Current teams (2019\u201320)===\n{{location map+ |Denmark |float=right |width=425 |caption=Locations of teams in the 2019\u201320 Danish Superliga |alt=Locations of teams in the 2019\u201320 Danish Superliga |places=\n{{location map~ |Denmark |lat=57.0515   |long=9.8991    |label=[[Aalborg Boldspilklub|AaB]]|position=right}}\n{{location map~ |Denmark |lat=55.871555 |long=9.857161  |label=[[AC Horsens]]|position=right}}\n{{location map~ |Denmark |lat=56.131944 |long=10.196389 |label=[[Aarhus Gymnastikforening|AGF]]|position=right}}\n{{location map~ |Denmark |lat=55.648839 |long=12.418517 |label=[[Br\u00f8ndby IF]]|position=left}}\n{{location map~ |Denmark |lat=55.702469 |long=12.572203 |label=<!--Copenhagen-->}}\n{{location map~ |Denmark |lat=55.481985 |long=8.43941   |label=[[Esbjerg fB]]|position=bottom}}\n{{location map~ |Denmark |lat=56.638758 |long=9.798421  |label=[[Hobro IK]]|position=left}}\n{{location map~ |Denmark |lat=55.781142  |long=12.505791  |label=[[Lyngby Boldklub|Lyngby]]|position=right}}\n{{location map~ |Denmark |lat=56.116868 |long=8.951669  |label=[[FC Midtjylland|FC&nbsp;Midtjylland]]|position=bottom}}\n{{location map~ |Denmark |lat=55.815847 |long=12.353289 |label=[[FC Nordsj\u00e6lland|FC&nbsp;Nordsj\u00e6lland]]|position=top}}\n{{location map~ |Denmark |lat=55.397771 |long=10.350055 |label=[[Odense Boldklub|OB]]|position=right}}\n{{location map~ |Denmark |lat=56.46594  |long=10.010262 |label=[[Randers FC]]|position=right}}\n{{location map~ |Denmark |lat=56.184284 |long=9.575669  |label=[[Silkeborg IF|Silkeborg]]|position=top}}\n{{location map~ |Denmark |lat=55.261359 |long=9.487791  |label=[[S\u00f8nderjyskE Fodbold|S\u00f8nderjyskE]]|position=bottom}}\n<!-- DISPLAY FIX FOR COPENHAGEN -->\n{{location map~ |Denmark |mark=TransparentPlaceholder.png|lat=55.6 |long=12.572203 |label=[[F.C.
