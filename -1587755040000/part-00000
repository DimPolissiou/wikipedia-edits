The 52nd running of the [[Daytona 500]], it was held on February 14, 2010, in [[Daytona Beach, Florida]], at [[Daytona International Speedway]], before a crowd of about 175,000 attendees. [[Chip Ganassi Racing|Earnhardt Ganassi Racing]] driver [[Jamie McMurray]] won the 208-lap race from the 13th position. [[Dale Earnhardt Jr.]] of [[Hendrick Motorsports]] finished in second, and [[Roush Fenway Racing]]'s [[Greg Biffle]] was third.\n\n[[Mark Martin]], the oldest [[pole position]] winner in event history at 51 years and 27 days, led the opening four laps before [[Kasey Kahne]] passed him on lap five. Martin retook the lead two laps later. The lead changed 52 times among a then record-breaking 21 different drivers during the course of the race, with [[Kevin Harvick]] leading the most laps (41). It was twice [[Racing flags#Red flag|stopped]] because a large [[pothole]] developed between turns one and two, due to moisture, cold weather, and heavy cars scraping the tarmac surface as they ran low to the ground for better [[Aerodynamics|aerodynamic]] efficiency. Harvick led on the 206th lap, until McMurray passed to claim his first Daytona 500 victory, and the fourth of his career.\n\nBecause this was the first race of the season, McMurray led the [[List of Monster Energy NASCAR Cup Series champions|Drivers' Championship]] with 195 [[List of NASCAR points scoring systems|points]], followed by Earnhardt in second place who had 175 points and Biffle in third with 170 points. [[Clint Bowyer]] and Harvick were fourth and fifth with 165 and 155 points, respectively. In the  [[List of NASCAR Manufacturers' champions|Manufacturers' Championship]], [[Chevrolet]] led with nine points, ahead of [[Ford Motor Company|Ford]] in second place with six points. [[Toyota]] was in third with four points, and [[Dodge]] completed the top four with three points with thirty-five races left in the season.\n\n==Background==\n[[File:Daytona International Speedway.svg|alt=Layout of Daytona International Speedway|thumb|left|[[Daytona International Speedway]], where the race was held]]\n\nThe 2010 [[Daytona 500]] was the 1st of the 36 [[Stock car racing|stock car races]] in the [[2010 NASCAR Sprint Cup Series]],<ref name=\"rr500\" /> and the 52nd edition of the event.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.orlandosentinel.com/sports/os-xpm-2010-02-14-os-nascar-daytona-500-storylines-0214-20100214-story.html|title=NASCAR: Storylines to watch for the 52nd running of the Daytona 500|last=Ganguli|first=Tania|date=February 14, 2010|work=[[Orlando Sentinel]]|access-date=January 12, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190112110306/https://www.orlandosentinel.com/sports/os-xpm-2010-02-14-os-nascar-daytona-500-storylines-0214-20100214-story.html|archive-date=January 12, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref> It was held on February 14, 2010, in [[Daytona Beach, Florida]], at [[Daytona International Speedway]],<ref name=rr500/>  a [[Oval track racing|superspeedway]] track.<ref name=\"tacksnascar\">{{cite web|title=NASCAR Race Tracks|url=http://www.nascar.com/races/tracks/|accessdate=December 20, 2011|work=NASCAR|publisher=Turner Sports Interactive, Inc.|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130105015851/http://www.nascar.com/races/tracks/|archivedate=January 5, 2013}}</ref> Its standard track is a four-turn, {{convert|2.5|mi|km|adj=on}} superspeedway.<ref name=\"daytrack\">{{cite web|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/travel/news/story?id=2346804|title=Daytona International Speedway|date=June 27, 2011|publisher=[[ESPN]]|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120120202142/http://espn.go.com/espn/thelife/news/story?id=2346804|archivedate=January 20, 2012|url-status=dead|accessdate=June 25, 2015}}</ref> Daytona's turns are banked at 31&nbsp;[[Degree (angle)|degrees]], and the [[Straight (racing)|front stretch]]\u2014the location of the finish line\u2014is banked at 18&nbsp;degrees.<ref name=daytrack />\n\n[[NASCAR]] founder [[Bill France Sr.]] conceived the Daytona 500,<ref name=nelson500>{{cite book|last=R.

The 52nd running of the [[Daytona 500]], it was held on February 14, 2010, in [[Daytona Beach, Florida]], at [[Daytona International Speedway]], before a crowd of about 175,000 attendees. [[Chip Ganassi Racing|Earnhardt Ganassi Racing]] driver [[Jamie McMurray]] won the 208-lap race from the 13th position. [[Dale Earnhardt Jr.]] of [[Hendrick Motorsports]] finished in second, and [[Roush Fenway Racing]]'s [[Greg Biffle]] was third.\n\n[[Mark Martin]], the oldest [[pole position]] winner in event history at 51 years and 27 days, led the opening four laps before [[Kasey Kahne]] passed him on lap five. Martin retook the lead two laps later. The lead changed 52 times among a then record-breaking 21 different drivers during the course of the race, with [[Kevin Harvick]] leading the most laps (41). It was twice [[Racing flags#Red flag|stopped]] because a large [[pothole]] developed between turns one and two, due to moisture, cold weather, and heavy cars scraping the tarmac surface as they ran low to the ground for better [[Aerodynamics|aerodynamic]] efficiency. Harvick led on the 206th lap, until McMurray passed to claim his first Daytona 500 victory, and the fourth of his career.\n\nBecause this was the first race of the season, McMurray led the [[List of Monster Energy NASCAR Cup Series champions|Drivers' Championship]] with 195 [[List of NASCAR points scoring systems|points]], followed by Earnhardt in second place who had 175 points and Biffle in third with 170 points. [[Clint Bowyer]] and Harvick were fourth and fifth with 165 and 155 points, respectively. In the  [[List of NASCAR Manufacturers' champions|Manufacturers' Championship]], [[Chevrolet]] led with nine points, ahead of [[Ford Motor Company|Ford]] in second place with six points. [[Toyota]] was in third with four points, and [[Dodge]] completed the top four with three points with thirty-five races left in the season.\n\n==Background==\n[[File:Daytona International Speedway.svg|alt=Layout of Daytona International Speedway|thumb|left|[[Daytona International Speedway]], where the race was held]]\n\nThe 2010 [[Daytona 500]] was the 1st of the 36 [[Stock car racing|stock car races]] in the [[2010 NASCAR Sprint Cup Series]],<ref name=\"rr500\" /> and the 52nd edition of the event.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.orlandosentinel.com/sports/os-xpm-2010-02-14-os-nascar-daytona-500-storylines-0214-20100214-story.html|title=NASCAR: Storylines to watch for the 52nd running of the Daytona 500|last=Ganguli|first=Tania|date=February 14, 2010|work=[[Orlando Sentinel]]|access-date=January 12, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190112110306/https://www.orlandosentinel.com/sports/os-xpm-2010-02-14-os-nascar-daytona-500-storylines-0214-20100214-story.html|archive-date=January 12, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref> It was held on February 14, 2010, in [[Daytona Beach, Florida]], at [[Daytona International Speedway]],<ref name=rr500/>  a [[Oval track racing|superspeedway]] track.<ref name=\"tacksnascar\">{{cite web|title=NASCAR Race Tracks|url=http://www.nascar.com/races/tracks/|accessdate=December 20, 2011|work=NASCAR|publisher=Turner Sports Interactive, Inc.|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130105015851/http://www.nascar.com/races/tracks/|archivedate=January 5, 2013}}</ref> Its standard track is a four-turn, {{convert|2.5|mi|km|adj=on}} superspeedway.<ref name=\"daytrack\">{{cite web|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/travel/news/story?id=2346804|title=Daytona International Speedway|date=June 27, 2011|publisher=[[ESPN]]|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120120202142/http://espn.go.com/espn/thelife/news/story?id=2346804|archivedate=January 20, 2012|url-status=dead|accessdate=June 25, 2015}}</ref> Daytona's turns are banked at 31&nbsp;[[Degree (angle)|degrees]], and the [[Straight (racing)|front stretch]]\u2014the location of the finish line\u2014is banked at 18&nbsp;degrees.<ref name=daytrack />\n\n[[NASCAR]] founder [[Bill France Sr.]] conceived the Daytona 500,<ref name=nelson500>{{cite book|last=R.

During the time between this and the first census of 1801 names continually changed due to the illiterate nature of the British population. Indeed, the need to be able to complete such documents may be a key factor in the change to fixed spellings.\n\nThe earliest documented evidence of the name in England dates back as far as the twelfth and thirteenth centuries where several instances have been recorded. One Colinus de Andresia appears in the pipe rolls of Berkshire in 1191, while a Colinus is mentioned in Hartopp's ''Register of the Freeman of Leicester'' recorded in 1196. The name Colinc is also mentioned several times in the [[Domesday Book]]. The personal name Colin from which the surname derives has an even older history; [[Ceawlin]], the king of the West Saxons, [[Caelin]], a brother of [[St Chad]], and the early Welsh saint, Kollen, all have names related to Colin. In Ireland, Collins is a genuinely indigenous Irish name; in fact, it is one of the most numerous surnames, ranked number 30.<ref>{{Citation\n |author=Bradley Collins |publisher=Ancestry.com\n |title=COLLINS FAMILY HISTORY: GENERAL INFORMATION: SURNAME HISTORY |work=Rootsweb\n |url=http://freepages.genealogy.rootsweb.com/~bcollins/general/namehist.htm\n |accessdate=31 August 2011 |archivedate=25 March 2010\n |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100325214645/http://freepages.genealogy.rootsweb.ancestry.com/~bcollins/general/namehist.htm\n }}</ref>\n\n{{compact ToC|side=yes|top=yes|num=yes}}\n\n==A==\n* [[Aaron Collins]] (1930\u20131997), American singer/songwriter\n* [[Aaron Collins]] (born 1997), Welsh footballer\n* [[A.

During the time between this and the first census of 1801 names continually changed due to the illiterate nature of the British population. Indeed, the need to be able to complete such documents may be a key factor in the change to fixed spellings.\n\nThe earliest documented evidence of the name in England dates back as far as the twelfth and thirteenth centuries where several instances have been recorded. One Colinus de Andresia appears in the pipe rolls of Berkshire in 1191, while a Colinus is mentioned in Hartopp's ''Register of the Freeman of Leicester'' recorded in 1196. The name Colinc is also mentioned several times in the [[Domesday Book]]. The personal name Colin from which the surname derives has an even older history; [[Ceawlin]], the king of the West Saxons, [[Caelin]], a brother of [[St Chad]], and the early Welsh saint, Kollen, all have names related to Colin. In Ireland, Collins is a genuinely indigenous Irish name; in fact, it is one of the most numerous surnames, ranked number 30.<ref>{{Citation\n |author=Bradley Collins |publisher=Ancestry.com\n |title=COLLINS FAMILY HISTORY: GENERAL INFORMATION: SURNAME HISTORY |work=Rootsweb\n |url=http://freepages.genealogy.rootsweb.com/~bcollins/general/namehist.htm\n |accessdate=31 August 2011 |archivedate=25 March 2010\n |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100325214645/http://freepages.genealogy.rootsweb.ancestry.com/~bcollins/general/namehist.htm\n }}</ref>\n\n{{compact ToC|side=yes|top=yes|num=yes}}\n\n==A==\n* [[Aaron Collins]] (1930\u20131997), American singer/songwriter\n* [[Aaron Collins]] (born 1997), Welsh footballer\n* [[A.

In 1970, he joined Leloir and Nicolas Behrens in their research that was involved with the incubation of dolichol-P-Glc using liver [[microsome]]s to transfer glucose to a dolichol-P-P-linked [[glycan]] known as Glc3Man9GlcNAc2-P-P-[[dolichol]].<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nAfter completing his fellowship in Paris, and returning to Buenos Aires, between the years of 1975 and 1978, he conducted research involved with demonstrating the presence of a dolichol-P-dependent pathway of [[N-linked glycosylation|N-glycosylation]] in yeast. However, a paper in 1980 that stated the lack of free or sugar-bound dolichol-P in [[Trypanosomatida|trypanosomatid]] protozoa meant that the pathway he discovered was not in the organism. This lead him to do his own research with trypanosomatids and using [[Carbon-14|<sup>14</sup>C]] Glucose he found that the synthesis of dolichol-P-P-glycans in protozoa was possible but glucose was lacking in the formed glycans.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nFurther research into glycans in trypanosomes, specifically [[Trypanosoma cruzi]], was conducted by Parodi. Using short pulses of <sup>14</sup>C, three protein glycans were produced and they were known as Glc<sub>1</sub>Man<sub>9</sub>GlcNAc<sub>2</sub>, Glc<sub>1</sub>Man<sub>8</sub>GlcNAc<sub>2</sub>, and Glc<sub>1</sub>Man<sub>7</sub>GlcNAc<sub>2</sub>.

He was able to find this using UDP-Glc: glycoprotein GT that worked as ways of sensing the various conformations of the glycoproteins. The sensitive of GT was very helpful as it was able to detect formations that were undetectable via other methods. This work was crucial in discovering how protein folding was controlled. By looking at how GT encouraged proper folding, the enzyme was found as a stress protein and there was increased synthesis of it during periods of stress for the [[Endoplasmic reticulum|ER]].<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite web|url=http://glycobiology.org/Awards-Programs/Award-Winners/Armando-J-Parodi.aspx|title=Armando J.

The sensitive of GT was very helpful as it was able to detect formations that were undetectable via other methods. This work was crucial in discovering how protein folding was controlled. By looking at how GT encouraged proper folding, the enzyme was found as a stress protein and there was increased synthesis of it during periods of stress for the [[Endoplasmic reticulum|ER]].<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite web|url=http://glycobiology.org/Awards-Programs/Award-Winners/Armando-J-Parodi.aspx|title=Armando J.

It stars [[Kurt Russell]], [[Lee Van Cleef]], [[Donald Pleasence]], [[Ernest Borgnine]], [[Isaac Hayes]], [[Adrienne Barbeau]], and [[Harry Dean Stanton]].\n\nThe film's storyline, set in the near-future world of 1997, concerns a crime-ridden [[United States]], which has converted [[Manhattan Island]] in [[New York City]] into the country's [[Types of US federal prisons|maximum-security prison]]. [[Air Force One]] is hijacked by terrorists and is purposely crashed in New York City. Ex-soldier and current federal prisoner [[Snake Plissken]] (Russell) is given just 24 hours to go in and rescue the [[President of the United States]], after which, if successful, Snake will be pardoned.\n\nCarpenter wrote the film in the mid-1970s in reaction to the [[Watergate scandal]]. After the success of ''[[Halloween (1978 film)|Halloween]]'' (1978), he had enough influence to begin production and filmed it mainly in [[St. Louis, Missouri]], on an estimated budget of $6 million.<ref name=\"thenumbers\"/><ref name=\"Phantom\">{{cite news | author=Phantom of the Movies | title=''Escape From New York'' rushes into a DVD world | work=Washington Weekend | pages=M24 | publisher=[[Washington Times]] | date=December 11, 2003}}</ref> [[Debra Hill]] and [[Larry J. Franco]] served as the producers. The film was co-written by [[Nick Castle]], who had collaborated with Carpenter by portraying [[Michael Myers (Halloween)|Michael Myers]] in ''Halloween''.\n\n''Escape from New York'' was released in the United States on July 10, 1981. The film received positive reviews from critics and was a commercial success, grossing more than $25 million at the [[box office]].<ref name=\"thenumbers\"/> The film was nominated for four [[Saturn Awards]], including [[Saturn Award for Best Science Fiction Film|Best Science Fiction Film]] and [[Saturn Award for Best Direction|Best Direction]]. The film became a [[cult film|cult]] [[cult following|classic]] and was followed by a [[sequel]], ''[[Escape from L.A.]]'' (1996), which was also directed and written by Carpenter and starred Russell, but was much less favorably received.\n\n==Plot==\nIn 1988, following a 400% increase in crime, the United States has turned Manhattan into a giant maximum-security prison. A {{convert|50|ft|m|adj=on}} wall surrounds the island, bridges have been [[Land mine|mined]], and all prisoners are sentenced to life terms.\n\nIn 1997, [[NATO]] is engaged in an escalating war with the [[Soviet Union]] across much of Europe, which threatens to become a [[nuclear holocaust]]. While traveling to a peace summit, Air Force One is hijacked by a domestic terrorist posing as a flight attendant. The president is given a tracking bracelet and is handcuffed to his briefcase, containing a [[cassette tape]] describing the secret to using nuclear [[nuclear fusion|fusion]] for electricity generation, intended to be a peace offering. He ejects in an [[escape pod]], landing in Manhattan just before the plane crashes.\n\nPolice are dispatched to rescue the President. Romero, the right-hand man of the Duke of New York, the overall [[crime boss]], warns that the Duke has the president, who will be killed if any further rescue attempts are made. Commissioner Bob Hauk offers a deal to Snake Plissken, a former [[United States Special Operations Forces|Special Forces]] soldier convicted of attempting to rob the [[Federal Reserve]]. If Snake rescues the president and the cassette tape, Hauk will arrange a [[presidential pardon]]. To ensure his compliance, Hauk has Plissken injected with micro-explosives that will rupture his arteries within 22 hours. If Snake is successful, Hauk will neutralize the explosives.\n\nSnake uses a stealth glider to land atop the [[World Trade Center (1973-2001)|World Trade Center]]. He follows the tracking bracelet to a [[vaudeville]] theater, only to find it on the wrist of an insane old man. Convinced the president is dead, Snake radios Hauk but is told that he will be shot down if he comes out empty-handed.\n\nSnake meets \"Cabbie,\" who remained in Manhattan after it became a prison and now drives an armored taxi. Cabbie takes Snake to Harold \"Brain\" Hellman, an adviser to the Duke and a former associate of Snake. Brain is a brilliant engineer and has established an oil well and a small refinery, fueling the city's remaining cars. Brain tells Snake that the Duke plans to lead a mass escape across the [[Queensboro Bridge]] by using the president as a human shield and following a landmine map that Brain has drawn up. Snake forces Brain and his girlfriend Maggie to lead him to the Duke's compound at [[Grand Central Terminal]]. Snake finds the president but is captured.\n\nWhile Snake is forced to fight in a [[deathmatch]] against \"Slag,\" Brain and Maggie kill Romero and flee with the president. Snake kills Slag, and takes Brain, Maggie, and the president to the top of the World Trade Center to escape in the glider. After a band of crazies destroys it, the group returns to street level and encounters Cabbie, who offers to take them across the bridge. When Cabbie reveals that he bartered with Romero for the cassette tape, the president demands it, but Snake takes it.\n\nThe Duke pursues them onto the bridge in his customized Cadillac, setting off mines as he tries to catch up. Brain guides Cabbie, but they hit a mine, and Cabbie is killed. As they continue on foot, Brain is killed by another mine. Maggie refuses to leave him, shooting at Duke's car until she is run down. Snake and the president reach the wall, and guards raise up the president via a rope. The Duke opens fire, killing the guards, but the president kills the Duke with a dead guard's assault rifle. Snake is lifted to safety, and the micro-explosives are neutralized after he hands over the cassette tape to Hauk.\n\nAs the president prepares for a televised speech to the leaders at the summit meeting, he thanks Snake and tells him that he can have anything he wants. All Snake wants to know is how the president feels about the people who died saving him. The president offers only half-hearted regret and lip service for their sacrifice. As Snake walks away in disgust, Hauk offers him a job as his deputy, but Snake just keeps walking. The president's live speech commences, and he plays the cassette tape. To his embarrassment, it only plays Cabbie's song, \"[[Bandstand Boogie]].\" As Snake continues to walk away, he unravels the real cassette tape, containing the president's intended message and deliberately shredding it.\n\n==Cast==\n<!--- Cast per closing credits order and roles as credited, top billed up to gypsy #x and #x indian --->\n{{Cast listing|\n*[[Kurt Russell]] as [[Snake Plissken|S.D. \"Snake\" Plissken]]\n*[[Lee Van Cleef]] as Bob Hauk\n*[[Ernest Borgnine]] as Cabbie\n*[[Donald Pleasence]] as [[President of the United States|the President]]\n*[[Isaac Hayes]] as the Duke\n*[[Harry Dean Stanton]] as Brain\n*[[Adrienne Barbeau]] as Maggie\n*[[Tom Atkins (actor)|Tom Atkins]] as Rehme\n*[[Season Hubley]] as Girl in [[Chock Full o' Nuts]]\n*[[Charles Cyphers]] as [[United States Secretary of State|Secretary of State]]\n*[[Frank Doubleday (actor)|Frank Doubleday]] as Romero\n*John Strobel as Cronenberg\n}}\n\nIn addition, frequent Carpenter collaborators [[Nancy Stephens]] and [[George Buck Flower|Buck Flower]] appeared as the stewardess/hijacker and the drunk with the President's tracker, respectively, while then-active professional wrestler \n[[Ox Baker]] played Slag.

Carpenter said, \"The whole feeling of the nation was one of real cynicism about the President. I wrote the screenplay and no studio wanted to make it because, according to Carpenter, \"it was too dark, too violent, too scary, and too weird.\"<ref>{{cite news|last=Yakir |first=Dan |title='Escape' Gives Us Liberty |newspaper=The New York Times |date=October 4, 1980 |url=http://www.theofficialjohncarpenter.com/pages/press/nypost801014.html |accessdate=March 10, 2007 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070317210916/http://www.theofficialjohncarpenter.com/pages/press/nypost801014.html |archivedate=March 17, 2007 }}</ref> He had been inspired by the film ''[[Death Wish (1974 film)|Death Wish]]'', which was very popular at the time.

Carpenter refused to cast Bronson on the grounds that he was too old, and because he worried that he could lose directorial control over the picture with an experienced actor. At the time, Russell described his character as \"a mercenary, and his style of fighting is a combination of [[Bruce Lee]], [[The Exterminator]], and [[Darth Vader]], with [[Clint Eastwood|Eastwood]]'s vocal-ness.\"<ref>{{cite journal|last=Hogan |first=Richard |title=Kurt Russell Rides a New Wave in ''Escape'' Film |magazine=[[Circus (magazine)|Circus]] |year=1980 |url=http://www.theofficialjohncarpenter.com/pages/press/circus1980.html |accessdate=March 10, 2007 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070317172535/http://www.theofficialjohncarpenter.com/pages/press/circus1980.html |archivedate=March 17, 2007 }}</ref> All that matters to Snake, according to the actor, is \"the next 60 seconds. Living for exactly that next minute is all there is.\" Russell used a rigorous diet and exercise program to develop a lean and muscular build. He also endeavored to stay in character between takes and throughout the shooting, as he welcomed the opportunity to get away from the Disney comedies he had done previously. He did find it necessary to remove the [[eyepatch]] between takes, as wearing it constantly seriously affected his [[depth perception]].<ref name=\"Goldberg, Lee\">{{cite journal|last=Goldberg |first=Lee |title=Kurt Russell&nbsp;\u2014 Two-Fisted Hero |pages= |magazine=[[Starlog]] |number=108 |date=July 1986 |url= |accessdate= }}</ref>\n\n===Pre-production===\nCarpenter had just made ''[[Dark Star (film)|Dark Star]]'', but no one wanted to hire him as a director, so he assumed he would make it in Hollywood as a screenwriter. The filmmaker went on to do other films with the intention of making ''Escape'' later. After the success of ''[[Halloween (1978 film)|Halloween]]'', Avco-Embassy signed  producer Debra Hill and him  to a two-picture deal. The first film from this contract was ''[[The Fog]]''. Initially, the second film  he was going to make to finish the contract was ''[[The Philadelphia Experiment (movie)|The Philadelphia Experiment]]'', but because of script-writing problems, Carpenter rejected it in favor of this project. However, Carpenter felt something was missing and recalls, \"This was basically a straight [[action film]].

The film's production designer [[Joe Alves]] and he rejected shooting on location in New York City because it would be too hard to make it look like a destroyed city. Carpenter suggested shooting on a movie back lot, but Alves nixed that idea \"because the texture of a real street is not like a back lot.\"<ref name=\"Beeler, Michael\">{{cite news | last = Beeler\n | first = Michael | coauthors = | title = ''Escape from N.Y.'': Filming the Original | work = | pages = | language = | publisher = [[Cinefantastique]]\n | date = | url = | accessdate = }}</ref> They sent Barry Bernardi, their location manager (and associate producer), \"on a sort of all-expense-paid trip across the country looking for the worst city in America,\" producer Debra Hill remembers.<ref name=\"Beeler, Michael\"/>\n\nBernardi suggested [[East St. Louis, Illinois]], because it was filled with old buildings \"that exist in New York now, and [that] have that seedy run-down quality\" that the team was looking for.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Maronie |first=Samuel J. |title=From ''Forbidden Planet'' to ''Escape from New York'': A candid conversation with SFX & production designer Joe Alves |magazine=[[Starlog]] |number=46 |date=May 1981 |url=http://www.theofficialjohncarpenter.com/pages/press/starlog8105.html |accessdate=March 10, 2007 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070317172834/http://www.theofficialjohncarpenter.com/pages/press/starlog8105.html |archivedate=March 17, 2007 }}</ref> East St. Louis, sitting across the Mississippi River from the more prosperous [[St. Louis, Missouri]], had entire neighborhoods burned out in 1976 during a massive urban fire. Hill said in an interview, \"block after block was burnt-out rubble. In some places, there was absolutely nothing, so that you could see three and four blocks away.\"<ref name=\"Beeler, Michael\"/> Also, Alves found an old bridge to double for the \"69th St. Bridge\". The filmmaker purchased the [[Chain of Rocks Bridge|Old Chain of Rocks Bridge]] for one dollar from the government and then gave it back to them, for the same amount, once production was completed, \"so that they wouldn't have any liability,\" Hill remembers.<ref name=\"Beeler, Michael\"/> Locations across the river in St. Louis were used, including [[Union Station (St. Louis)|Union Station]] and the [[Fox Theatre (St. Louis)|Fox Theatre]], both of which have since been renovated,<ref>{{cite news|title=Show Me the movies|work=St. Louis Post-Dispatch|date=April 17, 2005|author=Williams, Joe|page=C1}}</ref> as well as the building that would eventually become the [[Saint Louis Brewery#Downtown|Schlafly Tap Room microbrewery]].\n\n===Filming===\nCarpenter and his crew persuaded the city to shut off the electricity to 10 blocks at a time at night. The film was shot from August to November 1980. It was a tough and demanding shoot for the filmmaker as he recalls. \"We'd finish shooting at about 6 am and I'd just be going to sleep at 7 when the sun would be coming up. I'd wake up around 5 or 6 pm, depending on whether or not we had dailies, and by the time I got going, the sun would be setting.

Cameron was also one of the directors of photography on the film. As Snake pilots the glider into the city, three screens on his control panel display [[wire-frame model|wireframe]] animations of the landing target on the World Trade Center and surrounding buildings. Carpenter wanted high-tech computer graphics, which were very expensive, even for such a simple animation.

The novel provides motivation and backstory to Snake and Hauk&nbsp;\u2014 both disillusioned war veterans&nbsp;\u2014 deepening their relationship that was only hinted at in the film. The novel explains how Snake lost his eye during the Battle for [[Leningrad]] in [[World War III]], how Hauk became warden of New York, and Hauk's quest to find his crazy son, who lives somewhere in the prison. The novel fleshes out the world in which these characters exist, at times presenting a future even bleaker than the one depicted in the film. The book explains that the [[West Coast of the United States|West Coast]] is a no-man's land, and the country's population is gradually being driven crazy by nerve gas as a result of World War III.<ref name=\"McQuay\">{{cite book|last=McQuay |first=Mike |title=Escape from New York |publisher=Bantam Books |date=May 1981 |location= |pages= |isbn=0-553-25375-1}}</ref>\n\n===Comic books===\n[[Marvel Comics]] released the one-shot ''The Adventures of Snake Plissken'' in January 1997. The story takes place sometime between ''Escape from New York'' and before his famous Cleveland escape mentioned in ''Escape from L.A.'' Snake has robbed [[Atlanta]]'s [[Centers for Disease Control]] of some engineered [[Metavirus|metaviruses]] and is looking for buyers in [[Chicago]]. Finding himself in a deal that is really a set-up, he makes his getaway and exacts revenge on the buyer for ratting him out to the United States Police Force. In the meantime, a government lab has built a robot called ATACS (Autonomous Tracking And Combat System) that can catch criminals by imprinting their personalities upon its program to predict and anticipate a specific criminal's every move. The robot's first test subject is America's public enemy number one, Snake Plissken. After a brief battle, the tide turns when ATACS copies Snake to the point of fully becoming his personality. Now recognizing the government as the enemy, ATACS sides with Snake. Unamused, Snake sucker punches the machine and destroys it. As ATACS shuts down, it can only ask him, \"Why?\" Snake just walks off, answering, \"I don't need the competition\".\n\nIn 2003, [[CrossGen]] published ''[[John Carpenter's Snake Plissken Chronicles (comics)|John Carpenter's Snake Plissken Chronicles]]'', a four-part [[comic book]] miniseries.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&id=2168 |title=Snake Strikes Early!

Snake has been given a military [[Humvee]] after his presidential pardon and makes his way to [[Atlantic City, New Jersey|Atlantic City]]. Although the director's cut of ''Escape from New York'' shows Snake was caught after a bank job, this story has Snake finishing up a second heist that was planned before his capture. The job entails stealing the car in which [[John F. Kennedy]] was [[assassination of John F. Kennedy|assassinated]] from a casino before delivering it to a buyer in the [[Gulf of Mexico]]. Snake partners with a man named Marrs who ends up double crossing him. Left for dead in a sinking crab cage, Snake escapes and is saved by a passing fisherman named Captain Ron (an in-joke referring to Kurt Russell's 1992 comedy, ''[[Captain Ron]]''). When Ron denies Snake's request to use his boat to beat Marrs to the robbery, Snake decides to kill him. When Snake ends up saving Ron from the Russian mob, who wants money, Ron changes his mind and helps Snake. Once at the casino, Snake comes face-to-face with Marrs and his men, who arrive at the same time, ending in a high-speed [[shootout]]. Snake gets away with the car and its actress portraying [[Jackie Kennedy]], leaving Marrs to be caught by the casino owner, who cuts him a deal to bring his car back and live. After some trouble, Snake manages to finally get the car to the buyer's yacht, using Ron's boat, and is then attacked by Marrs. Following the firefight, the yacht and car are destroyed, Marrs and Captain Ron are dead, and Snake makes his escape in a helicopter with the 30 million credits owed to him for the job.\n\nIn 2014, [[BOOM!

It stars [[Kurt Russell]], [[Lee Van Cleef]], [[Donald Pleasence]], [[Ernest Borgnine]], [[Isaac Hayes]], [[Adrienne Barbeau]], and [[Harry Dean Stanton]].\n\nThe film's storyline, set in the near-future world of 1997, concerns a crime-ridden [[United States]], which has converted [[Manhattan Island]] in [[New York City]] into the country's [[Types of US federal prisons|maximum-security prison]]. [[Air Force One]] is hijacked by terrorists and is purposely crashed in New York City. Ex-soldier and current federal prisoner [[Snake Plissken]] (Russell) is given just 24 hours to go in and rescue the [[President of the United States]], after which, if successful, Snake will be pardoned.\n\nCarpenter wrote the film in the mid-1970s in reaction to the [[Watergate scandal]]. After the success of ''[[Halloween (1978 film)|Halloween]]'' (1978), he had enough influence to begin production and filmed it mainly in [[St. Louis, Missouri]], on an estimated budget of $6 million.<ref name=\"thenumbers\"/><ref name=\"Phantom\">{{cite news | author=Phantom of the Movies | title=''Escape From New York'' rushes into a DVD world | work=Washington Weekend | pages=M24 | publisher=[[Washington Times]] | date=December 11, 2003}}</ref> [[Debra Hill]] and [[Larry J.

The film was co-written by [[Nick Castle]], who had collaborated with Carpenter by portraying [[Michael Myers (Halloween)|Michael Myers]] in ''Halloween''.\n\n''Escape from New York'' was released in the United States on July 10, 1981. The film received positive reviews from critics and was a commercial success, grossing more than $25 million at the [[box office]].<ref name=\"thenumbers\"/> The film was nominated for four [[Saturn Awards]], including [[Saturn Award for Best Science Fiction Film|Best Science Fiction Film]] and [[Saturn Award for Best Direction|Best Direction]]. The film became a [[cult classic]] and was followed by a [[sequel]], ''[[Escape from L.A.]]'' (1996), which was also directed and written by Carpenter and starred Russell, but was much less favorably received.\n\n==Plot==\nIn 1988, following a 400% increase in crime, the United States has turned Manhattan into a giant maximum-security prison. A {{convert|50|ft|m|adj=on}} wall surrounds the island, bridges have been [[Land mine|mined]], and all prisoners are sentenced to life terms.\n\nIn 1997, [[NATO]] is engaged in an escalating war with the [[Soviet Union]] across much of Europe, which threatens to become a [[nuclear holocaust]]. While traveling to a peace summit, Air Force One is hijacked by a domestic terrorist posing as a flight attendant. The president is given a tracking bracelet and is handcuffed to his briefcase, containing a [[cassette tape]] describing the secret to using nuclear [[nuclear fusion|fusion]] for electricity generation, intended to be a peace offering. He ejects in an [[escape pod]], landing in Manhattan just before the plane crashes.\n\nPolice are dispatched to rescue the President. Romero, the right-hand man of the Duke of New York, the overall [[crime boss]], warns that the Duke has the president, who will be killed if any further rescue attempts are made. Commissioner Bob Hauk offers a deal to Snake Plissken, a former [[United States Special Operations Forces|Special Forces]] soldier convicted of attempting to rob the [[Federal Reserve]]. If Snake rescues the president and the cassette tape, Hauk will arrange a [[presidential pardon]]. To ensure his compliance, Hauk has Plissken injected with micro-explosives that will rupture his arteries within 22 hours. If Snake is successful, Hauk will neutralize the explosives.\n\nSnake uses a stealth glider to land atop the [[World Trade Center (1973-2001)|World Trade Center]]. He follows the tracking bracelet to a [[vaudeville]] theater, only to find it on the wrist of an insane old man. Convinced the president is dead, Snake radios Hauk but is told that he will be shot down if he comes out empty-handed.\n\nSnake meets \"Cabbie,\" who remained in Manhattan after it became a prison and now drives an armored taxi. Cabbie takes Snake to Harold \"Brain\" Hellman, an adviser to the Duke and a former associate of Snake. Brain is a brilliant engineer and has established an oil well and a small refinery, fueling the city's remaining cars. Brain tells Snake that the Duke plans to lead a mass escape across the [[Queensboro Bridge]] by using the president as a human shield and following a landmine map that Brain has drawn up. Snake forces Brain and his girlfriend Maggie to lead him to the Duke's compound at [[Grand Central Terminal]]. Snake finds the president but is captured.\n\nWhile Snake is forced to fight in a [[deathmatch]] against \"Slag,\" Brain and Maggie kill Romero and flee with the president. Snake kills Slag, and takes Brain, Maggie, and the president to the top of the World Trade Center to escape in the glider. After a band of crazies destroys it, the group returns to street level and encounters Cabbie, who offers to take them across the bridge. When Cabbie reveals that he bartered with Romero for the cassette tape, the president demands it, but Snake takes it.\n\nThe Duke pursues them onto the bridge in his customized Cadillac, setting off mines as he tries to catch up. Brain guides Cabbie, but they hit a mine, and Cabbie is killed. As they continue on foot, Brain is killed by another mine. Maggie refuses to leave him, shooting at Duke's car until she is run down. Snake and the president reach the wall, and guards raise up the president via a rope. The Duke opens fire, killing the guards, but the president kills the Duke with a dead guard's assault rifle. Snake is lifted to safety, and the micro-explosives are neutralized after he hands over the cassette tape to Hauk.\n\nAs the president prepares for a televised speech to the leaders at the summit meeting, he thanks Snake and tells him that he can have anything he wants. All Snake wants to know is how the president feels about the people who died saving him. The president offers only half-hearted regret and lip service for their sacrifice.

Finding himself in a deal that is really a set-up, he makes his getaway and exacts revenge on the buyer for ratting him out to the United States Police Force.

Snake has been given a military [[Humvee]] after his presidential pardon and makes his way to [[Atlantic City, New Jersey|Atlantic City]]. Although the director's cut of ''Escape from New York'' shows Snake was caught after a bank job, this story has Snake finishing up a second heist that was planned before his capture. The job entails stealing the car in which [[John F. Kennedy]] was [[assassination of John F. Kennedy|assassinated]] from a casino before delivering it to a buyer in the [[Gulf of Mexico]]. Snake partners with a man named Marrs who ends up double crossing him. Left for dead in a sinking crab cage, Snake escapes and is saved by a passing fisherman named Captain Ron (an in-joke referring to Kurt Russell's 1992 comedy, ''[[Captain Ron]]''). When Ron denies Snake's request to use his boat to beat Marrs to the robbery, Snake decides to kill him. When Snake ends up saving Ron from the Russian mob, who wants money, Ron changes his mind and helps Snake. Once at the casino, Snake comes face-to-face with Marrs and his men, who arrive at the same time, ending in a high-speed [[shootout]]. Snake gets away with the car and its actress portraying [[Jackie Kennedy]], leaving Marrs to be caught by the casino owner, who cuts him a deal to bring his car back and live. After some trouble, Snake manages to finally get the car to the buyer's yacht, using Ron's boat, and is then attacked by Marrs.

His family first lived at 2261 East 26th Street, later moving to 1628 East 29th Street. His favorite activity as a child was going to [[Coney Island]] and enjoying the rides at [[Steeplechase Park]]. As a youngster he was reportedly greatly interested in radio programs such as ''[[Boston Blackie]]'', ''[[The Bickersons]]'', ''[[The Adventures of Superman (radio)|Superman]]'', and ''[[The Shadow]]''.\n\nDuring 1951, when aged 16, he played the character \"Tooth Decay\" in a school hygiene play. He was also involved with the All City Radio Workshop at [[James Madison High School (Brooklyn)|James Madison High School]]. He wanted to pursue this more and spent ten hours a week working for dramatic educational productions at radio station WNYE-FM. \n\nMorrow enrolled as a student at [[Brooklyn College]] but soon quit. He then became a student at the Communications Arts Program at New York University. He was able to convince a dean to initiate the school's first radio station WCAG (Communications Arts Group). It was a [[carrier current]] station with a very limited range and programmed classical music.\n\nHe has three children, Meridith, a voice over actress, and former TV news anchor, Paige, a director, and Jon, a doctor.\n\n==Career==\n===Radio work===\nMorrow's first stint in radio was in [[Bermuda]] at [[ZBM (radio)|ZBM-AM]], where he was known as \"The Hammer\".<ref>Cousin Brucie: My Life in Rock 'N' Roll Radio (1987)</ref>\n\nMorrow began his career in the USA at [[New York City]] [[Top 40]] station [[WINS (AM)]] in 1959. In 1960, he relocated to [[Miami, Florida]] for a stint at [[WINZ (AM)]] before returning to New York the next year for the major station [[WABC (AM)|WABC]] (AM 770), another Top 40 station. Morrow's return to New York City came just as rock and roll music was becoming extremely popular among the [[baby boom]] demographic, and Morrow found himself on the most powerful radio station on the East Coast at the beginning of the so-called [[British Invasion]]. His main competition came from his previous station WINS, which featured \"[[Murray the K]],\" a DJ who claimed an association with the Beatles.\n\nMorrow quickly became a success on WABC's teenager-oriented evening shift for 7:15&nbsp;p.m. to 10:30&nbsp;p.m., presenting the diverse musical genres of the time ([[Motown]] soul, pop, hard rock, surf music, novelty records), as well as advertisements for youth-oriented sponsors like [[Thom McAn]], local clothing outlets in the New York and New Jersey areas, and events such as concerts and drag-strip races.\n\nMorrow worked for WABC for 13 years and 4,014 broadcasts until August 1974, when he transferred to rival radio station [[WNBC (AM)|WNBC]] replacing [[Wolfman Jack]] who quit to tour with [[The Guess Who]]; after three years there, he quit performance to team with entrepreneur [[Robert F.X. Sillerman]] to become the owner of the Sillerman Morrow group of radio stations, which included [[WALL]]; WKGL, now [[WRRV]], in Middletown, New York; WJJB, later [[WCZX]], in Poughkeepsie, New York; WHMP in Northampton, Massachusetts; WOCB in West Yarmouth, Massachusetts; WRAN (now dark) New Jersey 1510 in Randolph, New Jersey; and television station WATL Atlanta. The group later purchased [[WPLR]] in New Haven, Connecticut.\n\nDuring 1982, Morrow resumed working as a radio announcer, for New York's [[WCBS-FM]], an [[oldies]] station. Initially, he filled in for [[Jack Spector]] every third Saturday evening for the ''Saturday Night Sock Hop'' program.  After Spector's resignation during 1985, Morrow became the main performer for the program and renamed it the ''Saturday Night Dance Party''. The station also added his nationally syndicated show ''Cruisin' America''. During 1986, he began working the Wednesday evening shift, where he hosted ''The Top 15 Yesterday and Today Countdown''. During 1991, the Wednesday show became ''The Yearbook'', emphasizing music from the years between 1955 and 1979. Cousin Brucie was also the \"breakfast presenter\" on [[Atlantic 252]] from 1992 to 1996.\n\nWhen the radio program ''Cruisin' America'' ended during December 1992, Morrow continued hosting a WCBS radio program named ''Cruising with the Cuz'' Monday evenings until the end of 1993. After that program ended, he hosted the Saturday night and Wednesday night programs there until the station's change to an [[adult hits]] format named [[Jack FM]] on June 3, 2005.  Soon thereafter, he signed a multi-year deal to host oldies programming and a weekly talk program for [[Sirius Satellite Radio]].\n\n====Current programs====\nAs of 2019, Morrow hosts programs for [[Sirius XM]] [[satellite radio]], on the [['60s on 6]] channel. ''Cousin Brucie's Saturday Night Party \u2013 Live'' is broadcast Saturday nights, while ''Cruisin' with Cousin Brucie'' is broadcast live on Wednesday nights. The Wednesday broadcast used to repeat on Sunday nights, but no longer does. In place of the repeat, a show titled \"Best of Brucie\" airs, a compilation of all of his best moments on SiriusXM. His crew consists of former senior producer Adam Saltzman (grandson of studio session drummer Buddy Saltzman, and is currently working on The Beatles Channel), former producer Lauren Hornek (Now of Hits1), and current senior producer Colton Murray.\n\n===Television work===\nMorrow's voice can be heard in the movies ''[[Across the Universe (film)|Across the Universe]]'', ''[[Gas Pump Girls]]'', and ''[[Dirty Dancing]]''; he also had a minor part in the latter, playing a magician who saws Baby ([[Jennifer Grey]]) in half. He can be seen making on stage introductory remarks for the 1966 documentary ''[[The Beatles at Shea Stadium]]''. He also appeared in the 1978 movie ''[[Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band (movie)|Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band]]'' and had a guest appearance for the 1990s science fiction television series ''[[Babylon 5]]'', (in \"[[War Without End (Babylon 5)|War Without End]]\" (Part 2), playing the first officer of Babylon 4). In ''Across the Universe'' the radio station call letters he used were WEAF which were the call letters of 660 in New York before it became WNBC.<ref name=film>[http://www.fandango.com/brucecousinbruciemorrow/filmography/p556974 Fandango Filmography for Bruce Morrow] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303205841/http://www.fandango.com/brucecousinbruciemorrow/filmography/p556974 |date=March 3, 2016 }}.

Every \"miscarriage of justice\" in turn is a \"manifest injustice.\" Most criminal justice systems have some means to overturn or [[motion to quash|quash]] a wrongful conviction, but this is often difficult to achieve. In some instances a wrongful conviction is not overturned for several decades, or until after the innocent person has been [[wrongful execution|executed]], released from custody, or has died.\n\n==Terminology==\n\"Miscarriage of justice\" is sometimes used to describe any wrongful conviction, even when the defendant may be guilty, for example in reference to a conviction reached as the result of an unfair or disputed [[trial (law)|trial]].<ref>{{cite web |title=Miscarriage of Justice Law and Legal Definition |url=https://definitions.uslegal.com/m/miscarriage-of-justice/ |accessdate=2018-11-05 |publisher=definitions.uslegal.com |quote=The term 'miscarriage of justice' refers to a legal act or verdict that is clearly mistaken, unfair, or improper. Primarily, a miscarriage of justice is the [[conviction]] and [[punishment]] of a person for a crime they did not commit.}}</ref> While a miscarriage of justice is a [[Type I error]] for falsely identifying culpability, an error of impunity would be a [[Type II error]] of failing to find a culpable person guilty. However, the term \"miscarriage of justice\" is often used to describe the latter type as well. With [[capital punishment]] decreasing, the expression has acquired an extended meaning, namely any conviction for a crime not committed by the convicted person.\n\nThe term '''{{vanchor|travesty of justice}}''' is sometimes used for a gross, deliberate miscarriage of justice. [[Show trial]]s  (not in the sense of high publicity, but in the sense of lack of regard to the actual legal procedure and fairness), due to their character, often lead to such travesties.\n\nThe [[Scandinavian language]]s ([[viz.]] Danish, Norwegian and Swedish) and Finnish have a word, the Swedish variant of which is ''justitiemord'', which literally translates as \"justice murder\". [[Slavic language]]s use a different word (e.g., ''justi\u010dn\u00e1 vra\u017eda'' in Slovak, ''justi\u010dn\u00ed vra\u017eda'' in [[Czech language|Czech]]), but it is used for [[judicial murder]], while miscarriage of justice is \"justi\u010dn\u00ed omyl\" in Czech, implying an error of the justice system, not a deliberate manipulation. The term was originally used for cases where the accused was convicted, executed, and later cleared after death.\n\n==General issues==\nThe concept of miscarriage of justice has important implications for [[standard of review]], in that an [[appellate court]] will often only exercise its [[discretion]] to correct a [[plain error]] when a miscarriage of justice (or \"manifest injustice\") would otherwise occur. In recent years, [[genetic fingerprinting|DNA evidence]] has been used to clear many people falsely convicted.\n\nThe risk of miscarriages of justice is often cited as a cause to eliminate the death penalty. When condemned persons are executed before they are determined to have been wrongly convicted, the effect of that miscarriage of justice is irreversible. Wrongly executed people nevertheless occasionally receive posthumous [[pardon]]s\u2014which essentially [[void (law)|void]] the conviction\u2014or have their convictions quashed.\n\nEven when a wrongly convicted person is not executed, years in prison can have a substantial, irreversible effect on the person and their family. The risk of miscarriage of justice is therefore also an argument against long sentences, like a life sentence, and cruel prison conditions.\n\nCauses of miscarriages of justice include:<ref>{{Cite book|title=Safety from False Convictions|last=Sangero|first=Boaz|publisher=CreateSpace|year=2016|isbn=978-1536823738|location=United States|pages=|quote=|via=}}</ref>\n* [[Plea bargain]]s that offer incentives for the innocent to plead guilty, sometimes called an [[innocent prisoner's dilemma]]\n* [[Confirmation bias]] on the part of investigators\n* Withholding or [[destruction of evidence]] by police or [[prosecutor|prosecution]]\n* Fabrication of evidence or outright [[perjury]] by police (see [[testilying]]), or prosecution witnesses (e.g., [[Charles Randal Smith]])\n* Biased editing of evidence\n* Prejudice against the class of people to which the defendant belongs\n* [[Mistaken identity|Misidentification]] of the perpetrator by witnesses and/or victims\n* Overestimation/underestimation of the evidential value of [[expert witness|expert testimony]]\n* [[Contaminated evidence]]\n* Faulty [[forensic science|forensic]] tests\n* [[False confession]]s due to police pressure or psychological conditions\n* Misdirection of a jury by a judge during trial\n* [[perjury|Perjured]] evidence by the real guilty party or their accomplices ([[frameup]])\n* Perjured evidence by the alleged victim or their accomplices\n* Conspiracy between court of appeal judges and prosecutors to uphold conviction of the innocent\n* Fraudulent conduct by a judge: [[Judicial Misconduct]]\n\n==Rate of occurrence== \nVarious studies estimate that in the United States, between 2.3 and 5% of all prisoners are innocent.<ref>{{cite web |title=How many innocent people are there in prison? |publisher=[[The Innocence Project]] |url=http://www.innocenceproject.org/Content/How_many_innocent_people_are_there_in_prison.php |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141110182624/http://www.innocenceproject.org/Content/How_many_innocent_people_are_there_in_prison.php |url-status=dead |archivedate=2014-11-10 |accessdate=2018-09-13}}</ref> One study estimated that up to 10,000 people may be wrongfully convicted of serious crimes each year.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://globalwrong.files.wordpress.com/2012/04/qual-estimate-zal-clb-2012.pdf|title=Qualitatively Estimating the Incidence of Wrongful Convictions}}, Criminal Law Bulletin 48(2) [2012] 221\u2014279</ref>\n\nA 2014 study estimated that 4.1% of inmates awaiting execution on death row in the United States are innocent, and that at least 340 innocent people may have been executed since 1973.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/many-prisoners-on-death-row-are-wrongfully-convicted/|title=Many Prisoners on Death Row are Wrongfully Convicted|author=Dina Fine Maron|work=Scientific American}}</ref>\n\nAccording to Professor Boaz Sangero of the College of Law and Business in [[Ramat Gan]] in Israel, most wrongful convictions are for crimes less serious than major felonies such as rape and murder, as judicial systems are less careful in dealing with those cases.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.haaretz.com/news/national/.premium-1.589646|title=How You Could Land in Jail for Committing No Crime|work=Haaretz}}</ref>\n\n===Cultural consequences===\nWrongful convictions appear at first to be \"rightful\" arrests and subsequent convictions, and also include a public statement about a particular crime having occurred, as well as a particular individual or individuals having committed that crime. If the conviction turns out to be a miscarriage of justice, then one or both of these statements is ultimately deemed to be false.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Edmond|first=G.|title=Constructing Miscarriages of Justice: Misunderstanding Scientific Evidence in High Profile Criminal Appeals|journal=Oxford Journal of Legal Studies|year=2002|volume=22|issue=1|pages=53\u201389|doi=10.1093/ojls/22.1.53}}</ref> During this time between the miscarriage of justice and its correction, the public holds false beliefs about the occurrence of a crime, the perpetrator of a crime, or both. While the public audience of a miscarriage of justice certainly varies, they may in some cases be as large as an entire nation or multitude of nations.\n\nIn cases where a large-scale audience is unknowingly witness to a miscarriage of justice, the news-consuming public may develop false beliefs about the nature of crime itself. It may also cause the public to falsely believe that certain types of crime exist, or that certain types of people tend to commit these crimes, or that certain crimes are more commonly prevalent than they actually are. Thus, wrongful convictions can ultimately mold a society's popular beliefs about crime. Because our understanding of crime is socially constructed, it has been shaped by many factors other than its actual occurrence.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Rafter|first=N.|title=The Social Construction of Crime and Crime Control|journal=Journal of Research in Crime and Delinquency|year=1990|volume=27|issue=4|pages=376\u2013389|doi=10.1177/0022427890027004004}}</ref>\n\nMass media may also be faulted for distorting the public perception of crime by over-representing certain races and genders as criminals and victims, and for highlighting more sensational and invigorating types of crimes as being more newsworthy. The way a media presents crime-related issues may have an influence not only on a society's fear of crime but also on its beliefs about the causes of criminal behavior and desirability of one or another approach to crime control.<ref>{{cite book|last=Haney|first=C.|title=Death by Design: Capital Punishment as a Social Psychological System|url=https://archive.org/details/deathbydesigncap00hane|url-access=registration|year=2005|publisher=Oxford: Oxford University Press}}</ref> Ultimately, this may have a significant impact on critical public beliefs about emerging forms of crime such as cybercrime, global crime, and terrorism.<ref>{{cite book|last=Manning|first=P.K.|title=Policing Contingencies|url=https://archive.org/details/policingcontinge2003mann|url-access=registration|year=2003|publisher=University of Chicago Press|location=Chicago, IL}}</ref>\n\nThere are unfavorable psychological effects, even in the absence of any public knowledge.

Subsequently, the Posthumus II committee investigated whether injustice occrred in similar cases. The committee received 25 applications from concerned and involved scientists and selected three for further investigation: the [[Lucia de Berk]] case, the Ina Post case, and the Enschede incest case. In those three cases, independent researchers (professors [[Willem Albert Wagenaar|Wagenaar]], van Koppen, Isra\u00ebls, Crombag, and Derksen) concluded that confirmation bias and misuse of complex scientific evidence led to miscarriages of justice.\n\n===Spain===\nThe [[Spanish Constitution of 1978|Constitution of Spain]] guarantees compensation in cases of miscarriage of justice.\n\n===United Kingdom===\nIn the United Kingdom a jailed person, whose conviction is quashed, might be paid [[Damages|compensation]] for the time they were incarcerated.

He is seen here addressing an audience as to his advocacy in fighting miscarriages of justice]]\nUntil 2005, the parole system assumed all convicted persons were guilty, and poorly handled those who were not. To be paroled, a convicted person had to sign a document in which, among other things, they confessed to the crime for which they were convicted. Someone who refused to sign this declaration spent longer in jail than someone who signed it. Some wrongly convicted people, such as the [[Birmingham Six]], were refused parole for this reason. In 2005 the system changed, and began to parole prisoners who never admitted guilt.\n\nEnglish law has no official means of correcting a \"perverse\" verdict (conviction of a defendant on the basis of insufficient evidence). Appeals are based exclusively on new evidence or errors by the judge or prosecution (but not the defence), or jury irregularities. A reversal occurred, however, in the 1930s when [[William Herbert Wallace]] was exonerated of the murder of his wife. There is no right to a trial ''without'' jury (except during the troubles in Northern Ireland or in the case where there is a significant risk of jury-tampering, such as organised crime cases, when a judge or judges presided without a jury).\n\nDuring the early 1990s, a series of high-profile cases turned out to be miscarriages of justice. Many resulted from police fabricating evidence to convict people they thought were guilty, or simply to get a high conviction rate. The [[West Midlands Serious Crime Squad]] became notorious for such practices, and was disbanded in 1989. In 1997 the [[Criminal Cases Review Commission]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ccrc.gov.uk|title=Criminal Cases Review Commission|publisher=Government of the United Kingdom|accessdate=2009-03-18}}</ref> was established specifically to examine possible miscarriages of justice. However, it still requires either strong new evidence of innocence, or new proof of a legal error by the judge or prosecution. For example, merely insisting you are innocent and the jury made an error, or stating there was not enough evidence to prove guilt, is not enough. It is not possible to question the jury's decision or query on what matters it was based. The waiting list for cases to be considered for review is at least two years on average.{{citation needed|date=January 2011}}\n\nIn 2002, the NI Court of Appeal made an exception to who could avail of the right to a fair trial in R v Walsh: ''\"... if a defendant has been denied a fair trial it will almost be inevitable that the conviction will be regarded unsafe, the present case in our view constitutes an exception to the general rule. ... the conviction is to be regarded as safe, even if a breach of Article 6(1) were held to have occurred in the present case.\"''<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.courtsni.gov.uk/en-GB/Judicial+Decisions/JanJune02/j_j_car3538final.htm|title=Appeal Court Judgment|access-date=March 28, 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100415194648/http://www.courtsni.gov.uk/en-GB/Judicial+Decisions/JanJune02/j_j_car3538final.htm|archive-date=April 15, 2010|url-status=dead}}</ref> (See [[Christy Walsh (Case)]].)\n\n====Scotland====\nThe [[Criminal Appeal (Scotland) Act 1927]] increased the jurisdiction of the [[Scottish Court of Criminal Appeal]] following the miscarriage of justice surrounding the [[Trial of Oscar Slater]].\n\nReflecting [[Scots law|Scotland's own legal system]], which differs from that of the rest of the United Kingdom, the [[Scottish Criminal Cases Review Commission]] (SCCRC) was established in April 1999.

Every \"miscarriage of justice\" in turn is a \"manifest injustice.\" Most criminal justice systems have some means to overturn or [[motion to quash|quash]] a wrongful conviction, but this is often difficult to achieve. In some instances a wrongful conviction is not overturned for several decades, or until after the innocent person has been [[wrongful execution|executed]], released from custody, or has died.\n\n==Terminology==\n\"Miscarriage of justice\" is sometimes used to describe any wrongful conviction, even when the defendant may be guilty, for example in reference to a conviction reached as the result of an unfair or disputed [[trial (law)|trial]].<ref>{{cite web |title=Miscarriage of Justice Law and Legal Definition |url=https://definitions.uslegal.com/m/miscarriage-of-justice/ |accessdate=2018-11-05 |publisher=definitions.uslegal.com |quote=The term 'miscarriage of justice' refers to a legal act or verdict that is clearly mistaken, unfair, or improper. Primarily, a miscarriage of justice is the [[conviction]] and [[punishment]] of a person for a crime they did not commit.}}</ref> While a miscarriage of justice is a [[Type I error]] for falsely identifying culpability, an error of impunity would be a [[Type II error]] of failing to find a culpable person guilty. However, the term \"miscarriage of justice\" is often used to describe the latter type as well. With [[capital punishment]] decreasing, the expression has acquired an extended meaning, namely any conviction for a crime not committed by the convicted person.\n\nThe term '''{{vanchor|travesty of justice}}''' is sometimes used for a gross, deliberate miscarriage of justice. [[Show trial]]s  (not in the sense of high publicity, but in the sense of lack of regard to the actual legal procedure and fairness), due to their character, often lead to such travesties.\n\nThe [[Scandinavian language]]s ([[viz.]] Danish, Norwegian and Swedish) and Finnish have a word, the Swedish variant of which is ''justitiemord'', which literally translates as \"justice murder\". [[Slavic language]]s use a different word (e.g., ''justi\u010dn\u00e1 vra\u017eda'' in Slovak, ''justi\u010dn\u00ed vra\u017eda'' in [[Czech language|Czech]]), but it is used for [[judicial murder]], while miscarriage of justice is \"justi\u010dn\u00ed omyl\" in Czech, implying an error of the justice system, not a deliberate manipulation. The term was originally used for cases where the accused was convicted, executed, and later cleared after death.\n\n==General issues==\nThe concept of miscarriage of justice has important implications for [[standard of review]], in that an [[appellate court]] will often only exercise its [[discretion]] to correct a [[plain error]] when a miscarriage of justice (or \"manifest injustice\") would otherwise occur. In recent years, [[genetic fingerprinting|DNA evidence]] has been used to clear many people falsely convicted.\n\nThe risk of miscarriages of justice is often cited as a cause to eliminate the death penalty. When condemned persons are executed before they are determined to have been wrongly convicted, the effect of that miscarriage of justice is irreversible. Wrongly executed people nevertheless occasionally receive posthumous [[pardon]]s\u2014which essentially [[void (law)|void]] the conviction\u2014or have their convictions quashed.\n\nEven when a wrongly convicted person is not executed, years in prison can have a substantial, irreversible effect on the person and their family. The risk of miscarriage of justice is therefore also an argument against long sentences, like a life sentence, and cruel prison conditions.\n\nCauses of miscarriages of justice include:<ref>{{Cite book|title=Safety from False Convictions|last=Sangero|first=Boaz|publisher=CreateSpace|year=2016|isbn=978-1536823738|location=United States|pages=|quote=|via=}}</ref>\n* [[Plea bargain]]s that offer incentives for the innocent to plead guilty, sometimes called an [[innocent prisoner's dilemma]]\n* [[Confirmation bias]] on the part of investigators\n* Withholding or [[destruction of evidence]] by police or [[prosecutor|prosecution]]\n* Fabrication of evidence or outright [[perjury]] by police (see [[testilying]]), or prosecution witnesses (e.g., [[Charles Randal Smith]])\n* Biased editing of evidence\n* Prejudice against the class of people to which the defendant belongs\n* [[Mistaken identity|Misidentification]] of the perpetrator by witnesses and/or victims\n* Overestimation/underestimation of the evidential value of [[expert witness|expert testimony]]\n* [[Contaminated evidence]]\n* Faulty [[forensic science|forensic]] tests\n* [[False confession]]s due to police pressure or psychological conditions\n* Misdirection of a jury by a judge during trial\n* [[perjury|Perjured]] evidence by the real guilty party or their accomplices ([[frameup]])\n* Perjured evidence by the alleged victim or their accomplices\n* Conspiracy between court of appeal judges and prosecutors to uphold conviction of the innocent\n* Fraudulent conduct by a judge: [[Judicial Misconduct]]\n\n==Rate of occurrence== \nVarious studies estimate that in the United States, between 2.3 and 5% of all prisoners are innocent.<ref>{{cite web |title=How many innocent people are there in prison? |publisher=[[The Innocence Project]] |url=http://www.innocenceproject.org/Content/How_many_innocent_people_are_there_in_prison.php |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141110182624/http://www.innocenceproject.org/Content/How_many_innocent_people_are_there_in_prison.php |url-status=dead |archivedate=2014-11-10 |accessdate=2018-09-13}}</ref> One study estimated that up to 10,000 people may be wrongfully convicted of serious crimes each year.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://globalwrong.files.wordpress.com/2012/04/qual-estimate-zal-clb-2012.pdf|title=Qualitatively Estimating the Incidence of Wrongful Convictions}}, Criminal Law Bulletin 48(2) [2012] 221\u2014279</ref>\n\nA 2014 study estimated that 4.1% of inmates awaiting execution on death row in the United States are innocent, and that at least 340 innocent people may have been executed since 1973.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/many-prisoners-on-death-row-are-wrongfully-convicted/|title=Many Prisoners on Death Row are Wrongfully Convicted|author=Dina Fine Maron|work=Scientific American}}</ref>\n\nAccording to Professor Boaz Sangero of the College of Law and Business in [[Ramat Gan]] in Israel, most wrongful convictions are for crimes less serious than major felonies such as rape and murder, as judicial systems are less careful in dealing with those cases.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.haaretz.com/news/national/.premium-1.589646|title=How You Could Land in Jail for Committing No Crime|work=Haaretz}}</ref>\n\n===Cultural consequences===\nWrongful convictions appear at first to be \"rightful\" arrests and subsequent convictions, and also include a public statement about a particular crime having occurred, as well as a particular individual or individuals having committed that crime.

While the public audience of a miscarriage of justice certainly varies, they may in some cases be as large as an entire nation or multitude of nations.\n\nIn cases where a large-scale audience is unknowingly witness to a miscarriage of justice, the news-consuming public may develop false beliefs about the nature of crime itself. It may also cause the public to falsely believe that certain types of crime exist, or that certain types of people tend to commit these crimes, or that certain crimes are more commonly prevalent than they actually are. Thus, wrongful convictions can ultimately mold a society's popular beliefs about crime. Because our understanding of crime is socially constructed, it has been shaped by many factors other than its actual occurrence.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Rafter|first=N.|title=The Social Construction of Crime and Crime Control|journal=Journal of Research in Crime and Delinquency|year=1990|volume=27|issue=4|pages=376\u2013389|doi=10.1177/0022427890027004004}}</ref>\n\nMass media may also be faulted for distorting the public perception of crime by over-representing certain races and genders as criminals and victims, and for highlighting more sensational and invigorating types of crimes as being more newsworthy. The way a media presents crime-related issues may have an influence not only on a society's fear of crime but also on its beliefs about the causes of criminal behavior and desirability of one or another approach to crime control.<ref>{{cite book|last=Haney|first=C.|title=Death by Design: Capital Punishment as a Social Psychological System|url=https://archive.org/details/deathbydesigncap00hane|url-access=registration|year=2005|publisher=Oxford: Oxford University Press}}</ref> Ultimately, this may have a significant impact on critical public beliefs about emerging forms of crime such as cybercrime, global crime, and terrorism.<ref>{{cite book|last=Manning|first=P.K.|title=Policing Contingencies|url=https://archive.org/details/policingcontinge2003mann|url-access=registration|year=2003|publisher=University of Chicago Press|location=Chicago, IL}}</ref>\n\nThere are unfavorable psychological effects, even in the absence of any public knowledge.

Subsequently, the Posthumus II committee investigated whether injustice occrred in similar cases. The committee received 25 applications from concerned and involved scientists and selected three for further investigation: the [[Lucia de Berk]] case, the Ina Post case, and the Enschede incest case. In those three cases, independent researchers (professors [[Willem Albert Wagenaar|Wagenaar]], van Koppen, Isra\u00ebls, Crombag, and Derksen) concluded that confirmation bias and misuse of complex scientific evidence led to miscarriages of justice.\n\n===Spain===\nThe [[Spanish Constitution of 1978|Constitution of Spain]] guarantees compensation in cases of miscarriage of justice.\n\n===United Kingdom===\nIn the United Kingdom a jailed person, whose conviction is quashed, might be paid [[Damages|compensation]] for the time they were incarcerated.

He is seen here addressing an audience as to his advocacy in fighting miscarriages of justice]]\nUntil 2005, the parole system assumed all convicted persons were guilty, and poorly handled those who were not. To be paroled, a convicted person had to sign a document in which, among other things, they confessed to the crime for which they were convicted. Someone who refused to sign this declaration spent longer in jail than someone who signed it. Some wrongly convicted people, such as the [[Birmingham Six]], were refused parole for this reason. In 2005 the system changed, and began to parole prisoners who never admitted guilt.\n\nEnglish law has no official means of correcting a \"perverse\" verdict (conviction of a defendant on the basis of insufficient evidence). Appeals are based exclusively on new evidence or errors by the judge or prosecution (but not the defence), or jury irregularities. A reversal occurred, however, in the 1930s when [[William Herbert Wallace]] was exonerated of the murder of his wife. There is no right to a trial ''without'' jury (except during the troubles in Northern Ireland or in the case where there is a significant risk of jury-tampering, such as organised crime cases, when a judge or judges presided without a jury).\n\nDuring the early 1990s, a series of high-profile cases turned out to be miscarriages of justice. Many resulted from police fabricating evidence to convict people they thought were guilty, or simply to get a high conviction rate. The [[West Midlands Serious Crime Squad]] became notorious for such practices, and was disbanded in 1989. In 1997 the [[Criminal Cases Review Commission]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ccrc.gov.uk|title=Criminal Cases Review Commission|publisher=Government of the United Kingdom|accessdate=2009-03-18}}</ref> was established specifically to examine possible miscarriages of justice. However, it still requires either strong new evidence of innocence, or new proof of a legal error by the judge or prosecution. For example, merely insisting you are innocent and the jury made an error, or stating there was not enough evidence to prove guilt, is not enough. It is not possible to question the jury's decision or query on what matters it was based. The waiting list for cases to be considered for review is at least two years on average.{{citation needed|date=January 2011}}\n\nIn 2002, the NI Court of Appeal made an exception to who could avail of the right to a fair trial in R v Walsh: ''\"... if a defendant has been denied a fair trial it will almost be inevitable that the conviction will be regarded unsafe, the present case in our view constitutes an exception to the general rule. ... the conviction is to be regarded as safe, even if a breach of Article 6(1) were held to have occurred in the present case.\"''<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.courtsni.gov.uk/en-GB/Judicial+Decisions/JanJune02/j_j_car3538final.htm|title=Appeal Court Judgment|access-date=March 28, 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100415194648/http://www.courtsni.gov.uk/en-GB/Judicial+Decisions/JanJune02/j_j_car3538final.htm|archive-date=April 15, 2010|url-status=dead}}</ref> (See [[Christy Walsh (Case)]].)\n\n====Scotland====\nThe [[Criminal Appeal (Scotland) Act 1927]] increased the jurisdiction of the [[Scottish Court of Criminal Appeal]] following the miscarriage of justice surrounding the [[Trial of Oscar Slater]].\n\nReflecting [[Scots law|Scotland's own legal system]], which differs from that of the rest of the United Kingdom, the [[Scottish Criminal Cases Review Commission]] (SCCRC) was established in April 1999.
