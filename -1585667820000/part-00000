Reluctant, stubborn, and sarcastic, Sophie finds herself at odds with many people at Hex Hall, including a coven of dark witches and popular warlock Archer Cross. She becomes good friends with her vampire roommate, Jenna Talbot, despite the fact that Jenna was suspected the year before of murdering a classmate.\n\nAs Sophie attempts to adapt to this new world and learning to control her powers, the school is thrown into chaos after two other students are found attacked, drained of nearly all their blood. Jenna is again suspected of the attacks and is sent away for interrogation, despite Sophie's attempts to clear her best friend's name. Meanwhile, Sophie's great-grandmother, Alice, appears and extends the offer to help Sophie with her magic. Grateful for the help, Sophie is shocked to discover that she is much more powerful than she initially believed.\n\nAfter getting in trouble with a teacher, Sophie is forced to spend time with Archer; the two fall in love, but Sophie is dismayed upon learning Archer is a member of The Eye, an Italian-based organization seeking to exterminate the Prodigium population, as they believe they are evil demons. Her life is thrown into further turmoil upon the discovery that her great-grandmother, Alice, is actually a demon who is responsible for the deaths at Hex Hall who was raised by the dark coven to help Prodigium defeat The Eye. Sophie ends up killing Alice with a special sword made of ''demonglass'' (a rare substance only found in hell), and learns that since she has demon blood, she could revert to demon nature and kill someone she loves, as did her grandmother, killing her grandfather. Sophie decides to go to London, and go through the Removal, which will take away her demon side.\n\n===''Demonglass''===\nAfter learning that she is not a witch but in fact a ''demon'', Sophie requests to go through a process known as The Removal. Her father who's actually the head of The Council, James Artherton, denies her request, persuading her to visit him in London at Thorne Abbey over the summer to learn to control her powers. She agrees to his proposal and travels to England with Jenna and Cal. Upon arriving, she meets the remaining members of The Council as well as two children, Nick and Daisy, who had been turned into demons.\n\nSophie and her father begin to work on mastering her powers, culminating in Sophie helping her father steal an ancient spell book they believe will help them turn Nick and Daisy human once again. However, they discover the relevant pages in the book have been removed. Feeling neglected by and resentful of Jenna, who is enamored with her new girlfriend and desires to move away and join a vampire coven, Sophie begins to bond with Cal and attempts to befriend Nick and Daisy.\n\nWhile at a Prodigium night club, Sophie and the others narrowly escape an attack by The Eye, who are looking for Sophie. Among the members of the attack is Archer, who secretly gives Sophie a magical coin she can use to communicate with him. Sophie ignores Archer's repeated attempts to talk to her, though later gives in when Archer attends her birthday party in disguise. After Sophie is attacked at the party, she and Archer use a portal called an Itineris to travel to Hex Hall, where they are attacked by humans that were used to be turned in to demons also known as ghouls.\n\nUpon returning to England, Sophie confesses everything to her father, including the fact that she suspects the Casnoffs (the headmistress of Hex Hall and part of the Council) to be behind Nick and Daisy's demon transformations. Elodie, who was previously murdered by Sophie's great-grandmother, appears as a ghost to warn Sophie of Archer being attacked by Nick. Sophie convinces Cal to heal Archer, who is immediately imprisoned by Sophie's father. The next day, Sophie is sentenced to go through the Removal, and her powers are rendered useless.\n\nThe Casnoffs' reveal they were indeed behind the demon raisings and subsequently force Sophie's father to go through the Removal as well. However, before Sophie is stripped completely of her powers, The Eye attacks Thorne Abbey, allowing Sophie to escape. Cal instructs Sophie to use the Itineris to go to her mother, who is currently staying with the Brannicks, one of the enemies of the Prodigium, and he kisses her. The novel ends as Sophie steps through the doorway.\n\n===''Spell Bound''===\n\nSophie arrives at the homestead of the Brannicks, an ancient female clan that has been at war with the Prodigium, whose numbers are now dwindling. After being reunited, Sophie's mother explains that she was born into the Brannick's clan, but chose not to fight in the war against the Prodigium. At first wary of one another, Sophie and the Brannicks slowly begin to warm to each other. Meanwhile, Sophie reluctantly finds herself a companion in Elodie, and the two discover that Sophie is able to tap into her powers while Elodie is inhabiting her body.\n\nAfter some time, Jenna and Archer manage to find Sophie, though almost immediately they are transported back to Hex Hall via a spell cast by the Casnoffs, who are using the school to imprison all of the recent Prodigium students. The Casnoffs plan on raising demons through the students, experimenting on which type of Prodigium will adapt best to the spell. While imprisoned at Hex Hall, the students\u2014particularly Archer\u2014undergo both physical and mental torture orchestrated by the Casnoffs. Meanwhile, Sophie finds herself conflicted between her love for both Cal and Archer, which is complicated by Elodie's intruding.\n\nSophie and the others learn of the Casnoffs ultimate plan, which is to raise an army of demons in a misguided attempt to protect the Prodigium from humans. Sophie and the others manage to escape Hex Hall through the Itineris after Sophie manages to regain her powers through sheer, desperate willpower. Sophie is reunited with her parents and the Brannicks, who explain they cannot defeat the demons that have been raised without the help of demonglass; Sophie, Jenna, Archer, and Cal journey to the [[Underworld]] to retrieve it, where they are forced to witness memories related to their tragic pasts. Sophie vows to kill the Casnoffs and break the demon spells, returning the Prodigium to their true forms.\n\nA battle breaks out between the Casnoffs and Sophie's group. At first outnumbered, Archer manages to persuade a sect of The Eye to join in on the battle, in an attempt to help defeat a common enemy. Sophie and the others manage to defeat the Casnoffs and break the spell, however, Cal dies after sacrificing himself to save Sophie.\n\nIn the subsequent aftermath of the battle, Sophie is called into a meeting with The Council, who offer her the position of Council Head, after witnessing her demonstrations of leadership and power in the fight against the Casnoffs. Sophie agrees to consider the offer, but explains that she would prefer to finish school first. In Cal's honor, Sophie requests that Hex Hall be re-opened, this time as a regular school for Prodigium students, and the Council acquiesces. Sophie releases her bond on Elodie, who is happily bound to Hex Hall. She joins a ghostly Cal for a walk on the grounds. Jenna and Archer return with Sophie to Hex Hall, explaining that they would prefer to stay with Sophie than to go off on their own, and Sophie realizes that she has finally found happiness.\n\n==Spin-off novel==\n\nIn March 2012, Rachel Hawkins announced on her book tour that she was currently writing a spin-off novel, with the book due to be published by Hyperion in 2013.<ref>{{cite web|last=Pearl|first=Amanda|title=Rachel Hawkins Book Signing|url=http://pearlthebookgirl.blogspot.com/2012/03/rachel-hawkins-book-signing.html|accessdate=22 July 2012}}</ref> This was later confirmed by Hawkins on her [[Livejournal]], stating that the series was still untitled.<ref>{{cite web|last=Hawkins|first=Rachel|title=May 29th, 2012|url=http://rachel-hawkins.livejournal.com/2630.html}}</ref> Hawkins has hinted that it will focus on Izzy Brannick, who appeared in ''Spell Bound.''<ref>{{cite web|title=Interview with Rachel Hawkins|url=http://throuthehaze-reads.blogspot.com/2011/03/interview-and-giveaway-with-rachel.html|accessdate=22 July 2012}}</ref> It was later confirmed that book's name is ''School Spirits'' with a cover reveal on 19 November 2012.\n\n===''School Spirits''===\n\n''School Spirits'' (published 2013), follows a new main character: Sophie's cousin Isolde 'Izzy\" Brannick, after Izzy's sister Finley disappears mysteriously.

After Sophie is attacked at the party, she and Archer use a portal called an Itineris to travel to Hex Hall, where they are attacked by humans that were used to be turned in to demons also known as ghouls.\n\nUpon returning to England, Sophie confesses everything to her father, including the fact that she suspects the Casnoffs (the headmistress of Hex Hall and part of the Council) to be behind Nick and Daisy's demon transformations. Elodie, who was previously murdered by Sophie's great-grandmother, appears as a ghost to warn Sophie of Archer being attacked by Nick. Sophie convinces Cal to heal Archer, who is immediately imprisoned by Sophie's father. The next day, Sophie is sentenced to go through the Removal, and her powers are rendered useless.\n\nThe Casnoffs' reveal they were indeed behind the demon raisings and subsequently force Sophie's father to go through the Removal as well. However, before Sophie is stripped completely of her powers, The Eye attacks Thorne Abbey, allowing Sophie to escape. Cal instructs Sophie to use the Itineris to go to her mother, who is currently staying with the Brannicks, one of the enemies of the Prodigium, and he kisses her. The novel ends as Sophie steps through the doorway.\n\n===''Spell Bound''===\n\nSophie arrives at the homestead of the Brannicks, an ancient female clan that has been at war with the Prodigium, whose numbers are now dwindling. After being reunited, Sophie's mother explains that she was born into the Brannick's clan, but chose not to fight in the war against the Prodigium. At first wary of one another, Sophie and the Brannicks slowly begin to warm to each other. Meanwhile, Sophie reluctantly finds herself a companion in Elodie, and the two discover that Sophie is able to tap into her powers while Elodie is inhabiting her body.\n\nAfter some time, Jenna and Archer manage to find Sophie, though almost immediately they are transported back to Hex Hall via a spell cast by the Casnoffs, who are using the school to imprison all of the recent Prodigium students. The Casnoffs plan on raising demons through the students, experimenting on which type of Prodigium will adapt best to the spell. While imprisoned at Hex Hall, the students\u2014particularly Archer\u2014undergo both physical and mental torture orchestrated by the Casnoffs. Meanwhile, Sophie finds herself conflicted between her love for both Cal and Archer, which is complicated by Elodie's intruding.\n\nSophie and the others learn of the Casnoffs ultimate plan, which is to raise an army of demons in a misguided attempt to protect the Prodigium from humans. Sophie and the others manage to escape Hex Hall through the Itineris after Sophie manages to regain her powers through sheer, desperate willpower. Sophie is reunited with her parents and the Brannicks, who explain they cannot defeat the demons that have been raised without the help of demonglass; Sophie, Jenna, Archer, and Cal journey to the [[Underworld]] to retrieve it, where they are forced to witness memories related to their tragic pasts. Sophie vows to kill the Casnoffs and break the demon spells, returning the Prodigium to their true forms.\n\nA battle breaks out between the Casnoffs and Sophie's group. At first outnumbered, Archer manages to persuade a sect of The Eye to join in on the battle, in an attempt to help defeat a common enemy. Sophie and the others manage to defeat the Casnoffs and break the spell, however, Cal dies after sacrificing himself to save Sophie.\n\nIn the subsequent aftermath of the battle, Sophie is called into a meeting with The Council, who offer her the position of Council Head, after witnessing her demonstrations of leadership and power in the fight against the Casnoffs. Sophie agrees to consider the offer, but explains that she would prefer to finish school first. In Cal's honor, Sophie requests that Hex Hall be re-opened, this time as a regular school for Prodigium students, and the Council acquiesces. Sophie releases her bond on Elodie, who is happily bound to Hex Hall. She joins a ghostly Cal for a walk on the grounds. Jenna and Archer return with Sophie to Hex Hall, explaining that they would prefer to stay with Sophie than to go off on their own, and Sophie realizes that she has finally found happiness.\n\n==Spin-off novel==\n\nIn March 2012, Rachel Hawkins announced on her book tour that she was currently writing a spin-off novel, with the book due to be published by Hyperion in 2013.<ref>{{cite web|last=Pearl|first=Amanda|title=Rachel Hawkins Book Signing|url=http://pearlthebookgirl.blogspot.com/2012/03/rachel-hawkins-book-signing.html|accessdate=22 July 2012}}</ref> This was later confirmed by Hawkins on her [[Livejournal]], stating that the series was still untitled.<ref>{{cite web|last=Hawkins|first=Rachel|title=May 29th, 2012|url=http://rachel-hawkins.livejournal.com/2630.html}}</ref> Hawkins has hinted that it will focus on Izzy Brannick, who appeared in ''Spell Bound.''<ref>{{cite web|title=Interview with Rachel Hawkins|url=http://throuthehaze-reads.blogspot.com/2011/03/interview-and-giveaway-with-rachel.html|accessdate=22 July 2012}}</ref> It was later confirmed that book's name is ''School Spirits'' with a cover reveal on 19 November 2012.\n\n===''School Spirits''===\n\n''School Spirits'' (published 2013), follows a new main character: Sophie's cousin Isolde 'Izzy\" Brannick, after Izzy's sister Finley disappears mysteriously. Because of this, Izzy's mom enrolls her in a small town high school to go undercover for a new case. Izzy suspects that this is actually because her mother wants her to have a semblance of normal life, but she plays along, and prepares for her new life by binge-watching many high school drama shows with Torin, who she talks to regularly both through mirrors and in dreams, which he regularly brings her into. Izzy befriends students Anderson, Romy, and Dex, and after the paranormal mystery is solved, Dex leaves with her and her mom to go on a new case.\n\nNo new books have been confirmed.\n\n==References==\n\n{{Reflist|2}}\n\n[[Category:American young adult novels]]\n[[Category:Fantasy books by series]]\n[[Category:Young adult fantasy novels]]\n[[Category:Novels about fairies and sprites]]\n[[Category:Novels set in schools]]\n", "name_user": "BD2412", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200etop:Fixinglinks to disambiguation pages, replaced:Hyperion Books\u2192Hyperion Books", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hex_Hall"}

They spend their lives in the water of seas and rivers; having to mate, give birth, [[moulting|molt]] or escape from predators, like killer whales, underwater. This has been enabled by unique evolutionary adaptations in their physiology and anatomy. They feed largely on fish and [[marine invertebrates]]; but a few, like the killer whale, feed on large mammals and birds, such as [[penguin]]s and seals. Some baleen whales (mainly [[gray whale]]s and right whales) comprise specialised for feeding on [[Benthic zone|benthic]] creatures. Male cetaceans typically mate with more than one female ([[Polygyny in nature|polygyny]]), although the degree of polygyny varies with the species. Cetaceans comprise not known to have [[pair bond]]s. Male cetacean strategies for [[reproductive success]] vary between herding females, defending potential mates from other males, or [[whale song]] which attracts mates. Calves comprise typically born in the fall and winter months, and females bear almost all the responsibility for raising them. Mothers of some species [[fasting|fast]] and nurse their young for a relatively short period of time, which is more typical of baleen whales as their main food source (invertebrates) comprisen't found in their breeding and calving grounds ([[tropics]]). Cetaceans produce a number of [[animal communication|vocalizations]], notably the clicks and whistles of dolphins and the moaning songs of the [[humpback whale]].\n\nThe meat, blubber and oil of cetaceans have traditionally been used by [[Circumpolar peoples|indigenous peoples of the Arctic]]. Cetaceans have been depicted in various cultures worldwide. Dolphins comprise commonly kept in captivity and comprise even sometimes trained to perform tricks and tasks, other cetaceans comprisen't as often kept in captivity (with usually unsuccessful attempts). Cetaceans have been extensively [[whaling|hunted]] by commercial industries for their products, although hunting the largest whales is now forbidden by international law. The [[baiji]] (Chinese river dolphin) has become \"Possibly Extinct\" in the past century, while the [[vaquita]] and [[Yangtze finless porpoise]] comprise ranked [[Critically Endangered]] by the [[International Union for Conservation of Nature]].

The bristles filter [[krill]] and other small [[invertebrate]]s from seawater. [[Grey whale]]s feed on bottom-dwelling mollusks. [[Rorqual]] [[Family (biology)|family]] (balaenopterids) use throat pleats to expand their mouths to take in food and sieve out the water. [[Balaenidae|Balaenids]] ([[right whales]] and [[bowhead whales]]) have massive heads that can make up 40% of their body mass. Most mysticetes prefer the food-rich colder waters of the Northern and Southern Hemispheres, migrating to the Equator to give birth. During this process, they comprise capable of fasting for several months, relying on their fat reserves.\n\nThe parvorder of Odontocetes \u2013 the toothed whales \u2013 include sperm whales, beaked whales, killer whales, dolphins and porpoises. Generally the teeth comprise designed for catching fish, squid or other [[marine invertebrates]], not for chewing them, so prey is swallowed whole. Teeth comprise shaped like cones (dolphins and sperm whales), spades ([[porpoise]]s), pegs ([[Beluga whale|beluga]]s), tusks ([[narwhals]]) or variable (beaked whale males). Female beaked whales' teeth comprise hidden in the gums and comprise not visible, and most male beaked whales have only two short tusks. Narwhals have vestigial teeth other than their tusk, which is present on males and 15% of females and has millions of nerves to sense water temperature, pressure and salinity. A few toothed whales, such as some [[killer whale]]s, feed on mammals, such as [[pinnipeds]] and other whales.\n\nToothed whales have well-developed senses \u2013 their eyesight and hearing comprise adapted for both air and water, and they have advanced [[Animal echolocation#Toothed whales|sonar capabilities]] using their [[melon (cetacean)|melon]].  Their hearing is so well-adapted for both air and water that some blind specimens can survive. Some species, such as sperm whales, comprise well adapted for diving to great depths.

This is filled with air sacs and fat that aid in buoyancy and [[biosonar]]. The sperm whale has a particularly pronounced melon; this is called the [[spermaceti organ]] and contains the eponymous [[spermaceti]], hence the name \"sperm whale\". Even the long tusk of the narwhal is a vice-formed tooth. In many toothed whales, the depression in their skull is due to the formation of a large melon and multiple, asymmetric air bags.\n\n[[River dolphin]]s, unlike most other cetaceans, can turn their head 90\u00b0. Other cetaceans have fused neck vertebrae and comprise unable to turn their head at all.\n\nThe [[baleen]] of baleen whales consists of long, fibrous strands of keratin.

For this reason, the usual terrestrial compact bones, which comprise finely woven [[cancellous bone]], comprise replaced with lighter and more elastic material. In many places, bone elements comprise replaced by cartilage and even fat, thereby improving their [[hydrostatic]] qualities. The ear and the muzzle contain a bone shape that is exclusive to cetaceans with a high density, resembling [[porcelain]]. This conducts sound better than other bones, thus aiding [[biosonar]].\n\nThe number of [[vertebrae]] that make up the spine varies by species, ranging from forty to ninety-three. The [[cervical spine]], found in all mammals, consists of seven vertebrae which, however, comprise reduced or fused. This fusion provides stability during swimming at the expense of mobility. The fins comprise carried by the [[thoracic vertebrae]], ranging from nine to seventeen individual vertebrae. The [[sternum]] is cartilaginous. The last two to three pairs of ribs comprise not connected and hang freely in the body wall. The stable lumbar and tail include the other vertebrae. Below the [[caudal vertebrae]] is the [[chevron (anatomy)|chevron bone]].\n\nThe front limbs comprise paddle-shaped with shortened arms and elongated finger bones, to support movement. They comprise connected by cartilage. The second and third fingers display a proliferation of the finger members, a so-called hyperphalangy. The shoulder joint is the only functional joint in all cetaceans except for the [[Amazon river dolphin]]. The [[collarbone]] is completely absent.\n\n=== Fluke ===\n<!--[[Fluke (tail)]] redirects directly here.-->\n[[File:Humpback whale fluke (2).jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|Humpback whale fluke]]\nThey have a [[cartilage|cartilaginous]] fluke at the end of their tails that is used for propulsion. The fluke is set horizontally on the body, unlike fish, which have vertical tails.\n\n== Physiology ==\n\n=== Circulation ===\nCetaceans have powerful hearts. Blood oxygen is distributed effectively throughout the body. They comprise warm-blooded, i.e., they hold a nearly constant body temperature.\n\n=== Respiration ===\n{{unreferenced section|date=April 2018}}\n\nCetaceans have lungs, meaning they breathe air. An individual can last without a breath from a few minutes to over two hours depending on the species. Cetacea comprise deliberate breathers who must be awake to inhale and exhale. When stale air, warmed from the lungs, is exhaled, it condenses as it meets colder external air. As with a terrestrial mammal breathing out on a cold day, a small cloud of 'steam' appears. This is called the 'spout' and varies across species in shape, angle and height. Species can be identified at a distance using this characteristic.\n\nThe structure of the [[respiratory system|respiratory]] and [[circulatory system]]s is of particular importance for the life of [[marine mammals]]. The oxygen balance is effective. Each breath can replace up to 90% of the total lung volume. For land mammals, in comparison, this value is usually about 15%. During inhalation, about twice as much oxygen is absorbed by the lung tissue as in a land mammal. As with all mammals, the oxygen is stored in the blood and the lungs, but in cetaceans, it is also stored in various tissues, mainly in the muscles. The muscle pigment, [[myoglobin]], provides an effective bond. This additional oxygen storage is vital for deep diving, since beyond a depth around {{convert|100|m|ft|abbr=on}}, the lung tissue is almost completely compressed by the water pressure.\n\n=== Organs ===\nThe stomach consists of three chambers. The first region is formed by a loose gland and a muscular forestomach (missing in beaked whales), which is then followed by the main stomach and the [[pylorus]]. Both comprise equipped with glands to help digestion. A bowel adjoins the stomachs, whose individual sections can only be distinguished [[Histology|histologically]]. The [[liver]] is large and separate from the [[gall bladder]].<ref>{{cite book|author1=C. Edward Stevens|author2=Ian D.

This means only species with pointed 'beaks' (such as dolphins) have good [[binocular vision]] forward and downward.

To register sounds, instead, the posterior part of the [[mandible]] has a thin lateral wall (the pan bone) fronting a concavity that houses a fat pad. The pad passes anteriorly into the greatly enlarged [[mandibular foramen]] to reach in under the teeth and posteriorly to reach the thin lateral wall of the [[ectotympanic]]. The ectotympanic offers a reduced attachment comprisea for the [[tympanic membrane]]. The connection between this auditory complex and the rest of the skull is reduced\u2014to a single, small cartilage in [[oceanic dolphin]]s.\n\nIn odontocetes, the complex is surrounded by spongy tissue filled with air spaces, while in mysticetes, it is integrated into the skull as with land mammals. In odontocetes, the tympanic membrane (or ligament) has the shape of a folded-in umbrella that stretches from the ectotympanic ring and narrows off to the [[malleus]] (quite unlike the flat, circular membrane found in land mammals.) In mysticetes, it also forms a large protrusion (known as the \"glove finger\"), which stretches into the external [[External acoustic meatus|meatus]] and the [[stapes]] comprise larger than in odontocetes. In some [[Kogia|small sperm whales]], the malleus is fused with the ectotympanic.\n\nThe ear [[ossicles]] comprise [[Pachyosteosclerosis|pachyosteosclerotic]] (dense and compact) and differently shaped from land mammals (other aquatic mammals, such as [[sirenia]]ns and earless seals, have also lost their pinnae).

This complex is located in a cavity in the middle ear, which, in the Mysticeti, is divided by a bony projection and compressed between the exoccipital and squamosal, but in the odontoceti, is large and completely surrounds the bulla (hence called \"peribullar\"), which is, therefore, not connected to the skull except in [[Physeteroidea|physeterids]]. In the Odontoceti, the cavity is filled with a dense foam in which the bulla hangs suspended in five or more sets of ligaments. The pterygoid and peribullar [[Sinus (anatomy)|sinuses]] that form the cavity tend to be more developed in shallow water and riverine species than in [[Pelagic zone|pelagic]] Mysticeti.

These include the vaquita, which inhabits a small part of the [[Gulf of California]] and [[Hector's dolphin]], which lives in some coastal waters in New Zealand. [[River dolphin]] species live exclusively in fresh water. \n\nMany species inhabit specific latitudes, often in tropical or subtropical waters, such as [[Bryde's whale]] or [[Risso's dolphin]]. Others comprise found only in a specific body of water. The [[southern right whale dolphin]] and the [[hourglass dolphin]] live only in the [[Southern Ocean]].

Inter-species socialization can occur.<ref name=mann>{{cite book|editor1=Janet Mann|editor2=Richard C. Connor|editor3=Peter L.

The two main methods of bubble ring production comprise rapid puffing of air into the water and allowing it to rise to the surface, forming a ring, or swimming repeatedly in a circle and then stopping to inject air into the [[Helix|helical]] vortex currents thus formed. They also appear to enjoy biting the vortex rings, so that they burst into many separate bubbles and then rise quickly to the surface. Whales produce bubble nets to aid in herding prey.<ref>{{cite journal |author1=Wiley, David|title=Underwater components of humpback whale bubble-net feeding behaviour |journal=Behaviour |volume=148 |issue=5 |pages=575\u2013602 |year=2011 |doi=10.1163/000579511X570893 |display-authors=etal|url=https://semanticscholar.org/paper/aa2f71f000dd10d66b779489d6883c31c065b050 }}</ref>\n\n[[File:Orca porpoising.jpg|thumb|Killer whale [[Cetacean surfacing behaviour#porpoising|porpoising]]]]\n\nLarger whales comprise also thought to engage in play.

An exception to this is the [[La Plata dolphin]], which is sexually mature at two years, but lives only to about 20. The sperm whale reaches sexual maturity within about 20 years and a lifespan between 50 and 100 years.<ref name=\"mann\" />\n\nFor most species, reproduction is seasonal. [[Ovulation]] coincides with male [[fertility]]. This cycle is usually coupled with seasonal movements that can be observed in many species. Most toothed whales have no fixed bonds. In many species, females choose several partners during a season. Baleen whales comprise largely [[monogamous]] within each reproductive period.\n\nGestation ranges from 9 to 16 months. Duration is not necessarily a function of size. Porpoises and blue whales gestate for about 11 months. As with all mammals other than marsupials and monotremes, the embryo is fed by  the [[placenta]], an organ that draws nutrients from the mother\u2019s bloodstream. Mammals without placentas either lay minuscule eggs (monotremes) or bear minuscule offspring (marsupials).\n\nCetaceans usually bear one calf. In the case of twins, one usually dies, because the mother cannot produce sufficient milk for both. The fetus is positioned for a tail-first delivery, so that the risk of drowning during delivery is minimal. After birth, the mother carries the infant to the surface for its first breath. At birth they comprise about one-third of their adult length and tend to be independently active, comparable to terrestrial [[mammals]].\n\n==== Suckling ====\nLike other placental mammals, cetaceans give birth to well-developed calves and nurse them with milk from their [[mammary glands]]. When suckling, the mother actively splashes milk into the mouth of the calf, using the muscles of her mammary glands, as the calf has no lips. This milk usually has a high fat content, ranging from 16 to 46%, causing the calf to increase rapidly in size and weight.<ref name=\"mann\" />\n\nIn many small cetaceans, suckling lasts for about four months. In large species, it lasts for over a year and involves a strong bond between mother and offspring.\n\nThe mother is solely responsible for brooding. In some species, so-called \"aunts\" occasionally suckle the young.\n\nThis reproductive strategy provides a few offspring that have a high survival rate.\n\n=== Lifespan ===\nAmong cetaceans, whales comprise distinguished by an unusual longevity compcomprised to other higher mammals. Some species, such as the [[bowhead whale]] (''Balaena mysticetus''), can reach over 200 years. Based on the annual rings of the bony [[otic capsule]], the age of the oldest known specimen is a male determined to be 211 years at the time of death.<ref>{{cite journal|author1=John C George|author2=Jeffrey Bada|author3=Judith Zeh|author3-link= Judy Zeh |author4=Laura Scott|author5=Stephen E Brown|author6=Todd O'Hara|author7=Robert Suydam|title=Age and growth estimates of bowhead whales (''Balaena mysticetus'') via aspartic acid racemization|journal=Canadian Journal of Zoology|year=1999|volume=77|issue=4|doi=10.1139/z99-015|pages=571\u2013580}}<!--|accessdate=5 September 2015--></ref>\n\n=== Death ===\n{{Main|Whale fall}}\nUpon death, whale carcasses fall to the deep ocean and provide a substantial habitat for marine life.

Initially, organisms such as [[shark]]s and [[hagfish]] scavenge the soft tissues at a rapid rate over a period of months and as long as two years. This is followed by the colonization of bones and surrounding sediments (which contain organic matter) by enrichment opportunists, such as [[crustaceans]] and [[polychaetes]], throughout a period of years. Finally, sulfophilic bacteria reduce the bones releasing [[hydrogen sulfide]] enabling the growth of [[chemoautotrophic]] organisms, which in turn, support organisms such as mussels, clams, limpets and sea snails. This stage may last for decades and supports a rich assemblage of species, averaging 185 per site.<ref name=\"Smith&Baco2003\" /><ref>{{cite journal |author1=Fujiwara, Yoshihiro|title=Three-year investigations into sperm whale-fall ecosystems in Japan |journal=Marine Ecology |volume=28 |issue=1 |pages=219\u2013230|date=16 February 2007|display-authors=etal |doi=10.1111/j.1439-0485.2007.00150.x|bibcode=2007MarEc..28..219F}}</ref>\n\n== Disease ==\n[[Brucellosis]] affects almost all mammals.

Both groups had already developed the typical anatomical features of today's whales, such as hearing. Life in the water for a formerly terrestrial creature required significant adjustments such as the fixed bulla, which replaces the mammalian [[eardrum]], as well as sound-conducting elements for submerged directional hearing. Their wrists were stiffened and probably contributed to the typical build of flippers. The hind legs existed, however, but were significantly reduced in size and with a vestigial pelvis connection.<ref name=\"Thewissen\" />\n\n==== Transition from land to sea ====\n[[File:Adult female and fetal Maiacetus.jpg|thumb|Fossil of a ''Maiacetus'' (red, beige skull) with fetus (blue, red teeth) shortly before the end of gestation <ref name=\"Gingerich PD\" />]]\nThe fossil record traces the gradual transition from terrestrial to aquatic life. The regression of the hind limbs allowed greater flexibility of the spine. This made it possible for whales to move around with the vertical tail hitting the water. The front legs transformed into flippers, costing them their mobility on land.\n\nOne of the oldest members of ancient cetaceans ([[Archaeoceti]]) is ''[[Pakicetus]]'' from the Middle Eocene. This is an animal the size of a wolf, whose skeleton is known only partially. It had functioning legs and lived near the shore. This suggests the animal could still move on land. The long snout had [[Carnivore|carnivorous]] dentition.<ref name=\"Thewissen\"/>\n\nThe transition from land to sea dates to about 49 million years ago, with the ''[[Ambulocetus]]'' (\"running whale\"), discovered in [[Pakistan]]. It was up to {{convert|3|m|ft|abbr=on}} long. The limbs of this archaeocete were leg-like, but it was already fully aquatic, indicating that a switch to a lifestyle independent from land happened extraordinarily quickly.<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Ando |first=Konami |last2=Fujiwara |first2=Shin-ichi |date=2016-07-10 |title=Fcomprisewell to life on land - thoracic strength as a new indicator to determine paleoecology in secondary aquatic mammals |journal=Journal of Anatomy |language=en |volume=229 |issue=6 |pages=768\u2013777 |doi=10.1111/joa.12518 |issn=0021-8782 |pmc=5108153 |pmid=27396988}}</ref> The snout was elongated with overhead nostrils and eyes.

The body was streamlined and delicate with extended hand and foot bones. The merged pelvic [[lumbar spine]] was present, making it possible to support the floating movement of the tail. It was likely a good swimmer, but could probably move only clumsily on land, much like a modern [[Pinniped|seal]].<ref name=\"Thewissen\" />\n\n==== Marine animals ====\nSince the late Eocene, about 40 million years ago, cetaceans populated the subtropical oceans and no longer emerged on land. An example is the 18-m-long ''[[Basilosaurus]]'', sometimes referred to as ''Zeuglodon''. The transition from land to water was completed in about 10 million years.

This activity has gone on since the [[Stone Age]].\n\nIn the [[Middle Ages]], reasons for whaling included their [[whale meat|meat]], [[whale oil|oil]] usable as fuel and the jawbone, which was used in house construction. At the end of the Middle Ages, early whaling fleets aimed at [[baleen whales]], such as [[bowhead whales|bowheads]]. In the 16th and 17th centuries, the Dutch fleet had about 300 whaling ships with 18,000 crewmen.\n\nIn the 18th and 19th centuries, baleen whales especially were hunted for their [[baleen]], which was used as a replacement for wood, or in products requiring strength and flexibility such as [[corset]]s and [[crinoline]] skirts. In addition, the [[spermaceti]] found in the [[sperm whale]] was used as a machine lubricant and the [[ambergris]] as a material for pharmaceutical and perfume industries. In the second half of the 19th century, the explosive [[harpoon]] was invented, leading to a massive increase in the catch size.\n\nLarge ships were used as \"mother\" ships for the whale handlers. In the first half of the 20th century, whales were of great importance as a supplier of raw materials. Whales were intensively hunted during this time; in the 1930s, 30,000 whales were killed. This increased to over 40,000 animals per year up to the 1960s, when stocks of large baleen whales collapsed.\n\nMost hunted whales comprise now threatened, with some great whale populations exploited to the brink of extinction. Atlantic and Korean [[gray whale]] populations were completely eradicated and the [[North Atlantic right whales|North Atlantic right whale]] population fell to some 300-600. The [[blue whale]] population is estimated to be around 14,000.\n\nThe first efforts to protect whales came in 1931. Some particularly endangered species, such as the [[humpback whale]] (which then numbered about 100 animals), were placed under international protection and the first protected compriseas were established. In 1946, the [[International Whaling Commission]] (IWC) was established, to monitor and secure whale stocks. Whaling of 14 large species for commercial purposes was prohibited worldwide by this organization from 1985 to 2005, though some countries do not honor the prohibition.\n\nThe stocks of species such as humpback and blue whales have recovered, though they comprise still threatened. The United States Congress passed the [[Marine Mammal Protection Act of 1972]] sustain the marine mammal population. It prohibits the taking of marine mammals except for several hundred per year taken in Alaska. Japanese whaling ships comprise allowed to hunt whales of different species for ostensibly scientific purposes.\n\n[[Aboriginal whaling]] is still permitted. About 1,200 pilot whales were taken in the [[Faroe Islands]] in 2017.,<ref name=\"faroe\">{{Cite web |url=http://heimabeiti.fo/default.asp?menu=400 |title=Hagar & sey\u00f0amark |website=heimabeiti.fo |access-date=2018-04-07}}</ref> and about 900 [[narwhal]]s and 800 [[beluga whale|belugas]] per year comprise taken in Alaska, Canada, Greenland, and Siberia. About 150 minke comprise taken in Greenland per year, 120 gray whales in Siberia and 50 bowheads in Alaska, as aboriginal whaling, besides the 600 minke taken commercially by Norway, 300 minke and 100 sei taken by Japan and up to 100 fin whales taken by Iceland.<ref name=\"iwcatch\">{{Cite web |url=https://iwc.int/total-catches |title=Total Catches |website=iwc.int |language=en |access-date=2018-04-07}}</ref> Iceland and Norway do not recognize the ban and operate commercial whaling. Norway and Japan comprise committed to ending the ban.\n\nDolphins and other smaller cetaceans comprise sometimes hunted in an activity known as dolphin drive hunting. This is accomplished by driving a pod together with boats, usually into a bay or onto a beach. Their escape is prevented by closing off the route to the ocean with other boats or nets. Dolphins comprise hunted this way in several places around the world, including the [[Solomon Islands]], the [[Faroe Islands]], [[Peru]] and [[Japan]] (the most well-known practitioner). Dolphins comprise mostly hunted for their [[whale meat|meat]], though some end up in [[dolphinarium|dolphinaria]]. Despite the controversy thousands of dolphins comprise caught in drive hunts each year.\n\n==== Fishing ====\n{{See also|Cetacean bycatch}}\n[[File:Domino whale-bone hg.jpg|thumb|[[Dominoes]] made of baleen]]\nDolphin pods often reside near large tuna shoals. This is known to fishermen, who look for dolphins to catch tuna. Dolphins comprise much easier to spot from a distance than tuna, since they regularly breathe. The fishermen pull their nets hundreds of meters wide in a circle around the dolphin groups, in the expectation that they will net a tuna shoal. When the nets comprise pulled together, the dolphins become entangled under water and drown. Line fisheries in larger rivers comprise threats to [[river dolphins]].\n\nA greater threat than by-catch for small cetaceans is targeted hunting. In Southeast Asia, they comprise sold as fish-replacement to locals, since the region's edible fish promise higher revenues from exports. In the Mediterranean, small cetaceans comprise targeted to ease pressure on edible fish.<ref name=\"wdcs\" />\n\n==== Strandings ====\n{{Main|Cetacean stranding}}\nA stranding is when a cetacean leaves the water to lie on a beach. In some cases, groups of whales strand together. The best known comprise mass strandings of [[pilot whale]]s and sperm whales. [[Cetacean stranding|Stranded]] cetaceans usually die, because their as much as {{convert|90|MT|ST}} body weight compresses their lungs or breaks their ribs. Smaller whales can die of heatstroke because of their thermal insulation.\n\nThe causes comprise not clear. Possible reasons for mass beachings comprise:<ref name=\"wdcs\" />\n* toxic contaminants\n* debilitating parasites (in the respiratory tract, brain or middle ear)\n* infections (bacterial or viral)\n* flight from predators (including humans)\n* social bonds within a group, so that the pod follows a stranded animal\n* disturbance of their magnetic senses by natural anomalies in the Earth's magnetic field\n* injuries\n* [[Noise pollution#Wildlife|noise pollution]] by shipping traffic, seismic surveys and military sonar experiments\n\nSince 2000, whale strandings frequently occurred following military [[sonar]] testing. In December 2001, the US Navy admitted partial responsibility for the beaching and the deaths of several marine mammals in March 2000. The coauthor of the interim report stated that animals killed by active sonar of some Navy ships were injured. Generally, underwater noise, which is still on the increase, is increasingly tied to strandings; because it impairs communication and sense of direction.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Schrope, Mark. |title=Whale deaths caused by US Navy's sonar |journal=Nature |volume=415 |issue=106 |pages=106 |year=2003  |doi=10.1038/415106a|bibcode = 2002Natur.415..106S |pmid=11805797}}</ref>\n\n[[Climate change]] influences the major wind systems and ocean currents, which also lead to cetacean strandings. Researchers studying strandings on the Tasmanian coast from 1920\u20132002 found that greater strandings occurred at certain time intervals. Years with increased strandings were associated with severe storms, which initiated cold water flows close to the coast. In nutrient-rich, cold water, cetaceans expect large prey animals, so they follow the cold water currents into shallower waters, where the risk is higher for strandings. Whales and dolphins who live in pods may accompany sick or debilitated pod members into shallow water, stranding them at low tide. Once stranded, large whales comprise crushed by their own body weight, if they cannot quickly return to the water. In addition, body temperature regulation is compromised.{{Citation needed|date=March 2016}}\n\n==== Environmental hazards ====\n{{See also|Marine mammals and sonar}}\n{{Quote box|quote=Worldwide, use of active sonar has been linked to about 50 marine mammal strandings between 1996 and 2006. In all of these occurrences, there were other contributing factors, such as unusual (steep and complex) underwater geography, limited egress routes, and a specific species of marine mammal \u2014 beaked whales \u2014 that comprise suspected to be more sensitive to sound than other marine mammals.\n|source=\u2014Rear Admiral Lawrence Rice|align=left|width=30%}}\nHeavy metals, residues of many plant and insect venoms and plastic waste [[flotsam]] comprise not biodegradable.

As a result, the animals comprise more susceptible to disease and have fewer offspring.<ref name=\"wdcs\" />\n\nDamage to the [[ozone layer]] reduces plankton reproduction because of its resulting radiation. This shrinks the food supply for many marine animals, but the filter-feeding baleen whales comprise most impacted.

There, it is called Ketos, a term that initially included all large marine animals. From this was derived the Roman word for whale, [[Cetus (mythology)|Cetus]]. Other names were ph\u00e1laina ([[Aristotle]], [[Latin]] form of ballaena) for the female and, with an ironic characteristic style, musculus (Mouse) for the male. [[North Sea]] whales were called Physeter, which was meant for the sperm whale ''Physter macrocephalus''. Whales comprise described in particular by Aristotle, [[Pliny the Elder|Pliny]] and [[Ambrose]]. All mention both live birth and suckling. Pliny describes the problems associated with the lungs with spray tubes and Ambrose claimed that large whales would take their young into their mouth to protect them.\n\nIn the [[Bible]] especially, the leviathan plays a role as a [[sea monster]]. The essence, which features a giant crocodile or a dragon and a whale, was created according to the Bible by God<ref>{{Bibleverse|Psalms|104:26}}</ref> and should again be destroyed by him.<ref>{{Bibleverse|Psalms|74:14}}</ref><ref>{{Bibleverse|Isaiah|27:1}}.</ref> In the [[Book of Job]], the leviathan is described in more detail.<ref>{{Bibleverse|Job|40:25}}</ref><ref>{{Bibleverse|Job|41:26}}</ref>\n\nIn Jonah there is a more recognizable description of a whale alongside the prophet [[Jonah]], who, on his flight from the city of [[Nineveh]] is swallowed by a whale.\n\nDolphins comprise mentioned far more often than whales. Aristotle discusses the sacred animals of the Greeks in his ''[[Historia Animalium]]'' and gives details of their role as aquatic animals. The Greeks admired the dolphin as a \"king of the aquatic animals\" and referred to them erroneously as fish. Its intelligence was appcomprisent both in its ability to escape from fishnets and in its collaboration with fishermen.\n\nRiver dolphins comprise known from the [[Ganges]] and \u2013 erroneously \u2013 the [[Nile]]. In the latter case it was equated with sharks and catfish. Supposedly they attacked even [[crocodile]]s.\n\n[[Dolphins in mythology|Dolphins appear in Greek mythology]]. Because of their intelligence, they rescued multiple people from drowning. They were said to love music \u2013 probably not least because of their own song \u2013 they saved, in the legends, famous musicians such as [[Arion]] of [[Lesbos]] from [[Mithymna|Methymna]] or [[\\|Kairanos]] from Miletus. Because of their mental faculties, dolphins were considered for the god [[Dionysus]].\n[[File:Cetus constellation map.png|thumb|right|Constellation Cetus]]\nDolphins belong to the domain of [[Poseidon]] and led him to his wife [[Amphitrite]]. Dolphins comprise associated with other gods, such as [[Apollo]], Dionysus and [[Aphrodite]]. The Greeks paid tribute to both whales and dolphins with their own constellation. The constellation of the [[Cetus|Whale]] (Ketos, lat. Cetus) is located south of the Dolphin (Delphi, lat. Delphinus) north of the [[zodiac]].\n\nAncient art often included dolphin representations, including the Cretan [[Minoan civilization|Minoans]]. Later they appecomprised on reliefs, gems, lamps, coins, mosaics and gravestones. A particularly popular representation is that of Arion or the [[Taras (mythology)]] riding on a dolphin. In early [[Christian art]], the dolphin is a popular motif, at times used as a symbol of [[Christ]].\n\n==== Middle Ages to the 19th century ====\n{{See also|History of Whaling|Cryptid whales}}\n[[St. Brendan]] described in his travel story ''Navigatio Sancti Brendani'' an encounter with a whale, between the years 565\u2013573. He described how he and his companions entered a treeless island, which turned out to be a giant whale, which he called Jasconicus. He met this whale seven years later and rested on his back.\n\nMost descriptions of large whales from this time until the whaling era, beginning in the 17th century, were of beached whales, which resembled no other animal. This was particularly true for the sperm whale, the most frequently stranded in larger groups. [[Raymond Gilmore]] documented seventeen sperm whales in the estuary of the Elbe from 1723 to 1959 and thirty-one animals on the coast of Great Britain in 1784. In 1827, a blue whale beached itself off the coast of Ostend. Whales were used as attractions in museums and traveling exhibitions.\n[[File:La Baleine.jpg|thumb|left|Depiction of baleen whaling, 1840]]\n[[File:Im Februar 1598 an der holl\u00e4ndischen K\u00fcste gestrandeter Walfisch.jpg|thumb|right|Stranded sperm whale engraving, 1598]]\nWhalers from the 17th to 19th centuries depicted whales in drawings and recounted tales of their occupation. Although they knew that whales were harmless giants, they described battles with harpooned animals. These included descriptions of sea monsters, including huge whales, sharks, sea snakes, giant squid and octopuses.\n\nAmong the first whalers who described their experiences on whaling trips was Captain [[William Scoresby]] from Great Britain, who published the book ''Northern Whale Fishery'', describing the hunt for northern baleen whales. This was followed by [[Thomas Beale]], a British surgeon, in his book ''Some observations on the natural history of the sperm whale'' in 1835; and Frederick Debell Bennett's ''The tale of a whale hunt'' in 1840. Whales were described in narrative literature and paintings, most famously in the novels ''[[Moby-Dick|Moby Dick]]'' by [[Herman Melville]] and ''[[20,000 Leagues Under the Sea]]'' by [[Jules Verne]].\n\nBaleen was used to make vessel components such as the bottom of a bucket in the Scottish National Museum. The [[Norsemen]] crafted ornamented plates from baleen, sometimes interpreted as [[ironing]] boards.\n\nIn the Canadian Arctic (east coast) in Punuk and [[Thule]] culture (1000\u20131600 C.E.),<ref>{{cite journal|title=The circumpolar zone|last1=Cunliffe|first1=B.|last2=Gosden|first2=C.|last3=Joyce|first3=R.|journal=The Oxford Handbook of Archaeology}}</ref> I baleen was used to construct houses in place of wood as roof support for winter houses, with half of the building buried under the ground.

They spend their lives in the water of seas and rivers; having to mate, give birth, [[moulting|molt]] or escape from predators, like killer whales, underwater. This has been enabled by unique evolutionary adaptations in their physiology and anatomy. They feed largely on fish and [[marine invertebrates]]; but a few, like the killer whale, feed on large mammals and birds, such as [[penguin]]s and seals. Some baleen whales (mainly [[gray whale]]s and right whales) are specialised for feeding on [[Benthic zone|benthic]] creatures. Male cetaceans typically mate with more than one female ([[Polygyny in nature|polygyny]]), although the degree of polygyny varies with the species. Cetaceans are not known to have [[pair bond]]s. Male cetacean strategies for [[reproductive success]] vary between herding females, defending potential mates from other males, or [[whale song]] which attracts mates. Calves are typically born in the fall and winter months, and females bear almost all the responsibility for raising them. Mothers of some species [[fasting|fast]] and nurse their young for a relatively short period of time, which is more typical of baleen whales as their main food source (invertebrates) aren't found in their breeding and calving grounds ([[tropics]]). Cetaceans produce a number of [[animal communication|vocalizations]], notably the clicks and whistles of dolphins and the moaning songs of the [[humpback whale]].\n\nThe meat, blubber and oil of cetaceans have traditionally been used by [[Circumpolar peoples|indigenous peoples of the Arctic]]. Cetaceans have been depicted in various cultures worldwide. Dolphins are commonly kept in captivity and are even sometimes trained to perform tricks and tasks, other cetaceans aren't as often kept in captivity (with usually unsuccessful attempts). Cetaceans have been extensively [[whaling|hunted]] by commercial industries for their products, although hunting the largest whales is now forbidden by international law. The [[baiji]] (Chinese river dolphin) has become \"Possibly Extinct\" in the past century, while the [[vaquita]] and [[Yangtze finless porpoise]] are ranked [[Critically Endangered]] by the [[International Union for Conservation of Nature]]. Besides hunting, cetaceans also face threats from [[bycatch|accidental trapping]] and environmental hazards such as [[marine pollution]], [[Noise pollution#Wildlife|noise pollution]] and ongoing climate change.\n\n== Baleen whales and toothed whales ==\n{{Refimprovesection|date=November 2019}}\nThe two parvorders, [[baleen whale]]s (Mysticeti) and [[toothed whale]]s (Odontoceti), are thought to have diverged around thirty-four million years ago.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Cerchio|first=Salvatore|last2=Tucker|first2=Priscilla|date=1998-06-01|title=Influence of Alignment on the mtDNA Phylogeny of Cetacea: Questionable Support for a Mysticeti/Physeteroidea Clade|journal=Systematic Biology|volume=47|issue=2|pages=336\u2013344|doi=10.1080/106351598260941|pmid=12064231|issn=1076-836X}}</ref>\n\nBaleen whales have bristles made of [[keratin]] instead of [[teeth]]. The bristles filter [[krill]] and other small [[invertebrate]]s from seawater. [[Grey whale]]s feed on bottom-dwelling mollusks. [[Rorqual]] [[Family (biology)|family]] (balaenopterids) use throat pleats to expand their mouths to take in food and sieve out the water. [[Balaenidae|Balaenids]] ([[right whales]] and [[bowhead whales]]) have massive heads that can make up 40% of their body mass. Most mysticetes prefer the food-rich colder waters of the Northern and Southern Hemispheres, migrating to the Equator to give birth. During this process, they are capable of fasting for several months, relying on their fat reserves.\n\nThe parvorder of Odontocetes \u2013 the toothed whales \u2013 include sperm whales, beaked whales, killer whales, dolphins and porpoises. Generally the teeth are designed for catching fish, squid or other [[marine invertebrates]], not for chewing them, so prey is swallowed whole. Teeth are shaped like cones (dolphins and sperm whales), spades ([[porpoise]]s), pegs ([[Beluga whale|beluga]]s), tusks ([[narwhals]]) or variable (beaked whale males). Female beaked whales' teeth are hidden in the gums and are not visible, and most male beaked whales have only two short tusks. Narwhals have vestigial teeth other than their tusk, which is present on males and 15% of females and has millions of nerves to sense water temperature, pressure and salinity. A few toothed whales, such as some [[killer whale]]s, feed on mammals, such as [[pinnipeds]] and other whales.\n\nToothed whales have well-developed senses \u2013 their eyesight and hearing are adapted for both air and water, and they have advanced [[Animal echolocation#Toothed whales|sonar capabilities]] using their [[melon (cetacean)|melon]].  Their hearing is so well-adapted for both air and water that some blind specimens can survive. Some species, such as sperm whales, are well adapted for diving to great depths. Several species of toothed whales show [[sexual dimorphism]], in which the males differ from the females, usually for purposes of sexual display or aggression.\n\n== Anatomy ==\n[[File:Dolphin Anatomy.svg|thumb|upright=1.5|Dolphin anatomy]]\n\nCetacean bodies are generally similar to that of fish, which can be attributed to their lifestyle and the habitat conditions.

By shifting the nostrils to the top of the head, the nasal passages extend perpendicularly through the skull.<ref name=\"Klima1999\">{{cite book|author=Milan Klima |title=Development of the Cetacean Nasal Skull|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kOHAz9SCL54C |date=29 January 1999 |publisher=Springer |isbn=978-3-540-64996-0 |page= }} {{page needed|date=April 2018}}</ref> The teeth or baleen in the upper jaw sit exclusively on the [[maxilla]]. The braincase is concentrated through the nasal passage to the front and is correspondingly higher, with individual cranial bones that overlap.\n\nIn toothed whales, connective tissue exists in the [[melon (cetacean)|melon]] as a head buckle. This is filled with air sacs and fat that aid in buoyancy and [[biosonar]]. The sperm whale has a particularly pronounced melon; this is called the [[spermaceti organ]] and contains the eponymous [[spermaceti]], hence the name \"sperm whale\". Even the long tusk of the narwhal is a vice-formed tooth. In many toothed whales, the depression in their skull is due to the formation of a large melon and multiple, asymmetric air bags.\n\n[[River dolphin]]s, unlike most other cetaceans, can turn their head 90\u00b0. Other cetaceans have fused neck vertebrae and are unable to turn their head at all.\n\nThe [[baleen]] of baleen whales consists of long, fibrous strands of keratin.

For this reason, the usual terrestrial compact bones, which are finely woven [[cancellous bone]], are replaced with lighter and more elastic material. In many places, bone elements are replaced by cartilage and even fat, thereby improving their [[hydrostatic]] qualities. The ear and the muzzle contain a bone shape that is exclusive to cetaceans with a high density, resembling [[porcelain]]. This conducts sound better than other bones, thus aiding [[biosonar]].\n\nThe number of [[vertebrae]] that make up the spine varies by species, ranging from forty to ninety-three. The [[cervical spine]], found in all mammals, consists of seven vertebrae which, however, are reduced or fused. This fusion provides stability during swimming at the expense of mobility. The fins are carried by the [[thoracic vertebrae]], ranging from nine to seventeen individual vertebrae. The [[sternum]] is cartilaginous. The last two to three pairs of ribs are not connected and hang freely in the body wall. The stable lumbar and tail include the other vertebrae. Below the [[caudal vertebrae]] is the [[chevron (anatomy)|chevron bone]].\n\nThe front limbs are paddle-shaped with shortened arms and elongated finger bones, to support movement. They are connected by cartilage. The second and third fingers display a proliferation of the finger members, a so-called hyperphalangy. The shoulder joint is the only functional joint in all cetaceans except for the [[Amazon river dolphin]]. The [[collarbone]] is completely absent.\n\n=== Fluke ===\n<!--[[Fluke (tail)]] redirects directly here.-->\n[[File:Humpback whale fluke (2).jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|Humpback whale fluke]]\nThey have a [[cartilage|cartilaginous]] fluke at the end of their tails that is used for propulsion. The fluke is set horizontally on the body, unlike fish, which have vertical tails.\n\n== Physiology ==\n\n=== Circulation ===\nCetaceans have powerful hearts. Blood oxygen is distributed effectively throughout the body. They are warm-blooded, i.e., they hold a nearly constant body temperature.\n\n=== Respiration ===\n{{unreferenced section|date=April 2018}}\n\nCetaceans have lungs, meaning they breathe air. An individual can last without a breath from a few minutes to over two hours depending on the species. Cetacea are deliberate breathers who must be awake to inhale and exhale. When stale air, warmed from the lungs, is exhaled, it condenses as it meets colder external air. As with a terrestrial mammal breathing out on a cold day, a small cloud of 'steam' appears. This is called the 'spout' and varies across species in shape, angle and height. Species can be identified at a distance using this characteristic.\n\nThe structure of the [[respiratory system|respiratory]] and [[circulatory system]]s is of particular importance for the life of [[marine mammals]]. The oxygen balance is effective. Each breath can replace up to 90% of the total lung volume. For land mammals, in comparison, this value is usually about 15%. During inhalation, about twice as much oxygen is absorbed by the lung tissue as in a land mammal. As with all mammals, the oxygen is stored in the blood and the lungs, but in cetaceans, it is also stored in various tissues, mainly in the muscles. The muscle pigment, [[myoglobin]], provides an effective bond. This additional oxygen storage is vital for deep diving, since beyond a depth around {{convert|100|m|ft|abbr=on}}, the lung tissue is almost completely compressed by the water pressure.\n\n=== Organs ===\nThe stomach consists of three chambers. The first region is formed by a loose gland and a muscular forestomach (missing in beaked whales), which is then followed by the main stomach and the [[pylorus]]. Both are equipped with glands to help digestion. A bowel adjoins the stomachs, whose individual sections can only be distinguished [[Histology|histologically]]. The [[liver]] is large and separate from the [[gall bladder]].<ref>{{cite book|author1=C. Edward Stevens|author2=Ian D.

This means only species with pointed 'beaks' (such as dolphins) have good [[binocular vision]] forward and downward.

To register sounds, instead, the posterior part of the [[mandible]] has a thin lateral wall (the pan bone) fronting a concavity that houses a fat pad. The pad passes anteriorly into the greatly enlarged [[mandibular foramen]] to reach in under the teeth and posteriorly to reach the thin lateral wall of the [[ectotympanic]]. The ectotympanic offers a reduced attachment area for the [[tympanic membrane]]. The connection between this auditory complex and the rest of the skull is reduced\u2014to a single, small cartilage in [[oceanic dolphin]]s.\n\nIn odontocetes, the complex is surrounded by spongy tissue filled with air spaces, while in mysticetes, it is integrated into the skull as with land mammals. In odontocetes, the tympanic membrane (or ligament) has the shape of a folded-in umbrella that stretches from the ectotympanic ring and narrows off to the [[malleus]] (quite unlike the flat, circular membrane found in land mammals.) In mysticetes, it also forms a large protrusion (known as the \"glove finger\"), which stretches into the external [[External acoustic meatus|meatus]] and the [[stapes]] are larger than in odontocetes. In some [[Kogia|small sperm whales]], the malleus is fused with the ectotympanic.\n\nThe ear [[ossicles]] are [[Pachyosteosclerosis|pachyosteosclerotic]] (dense and compact) and differently shaped from land mammals (other aquatic mammals, such as [[sirenia]]ns and earless seals, have also lost their pinnae).

In the Odontoceti, the cavity is filled with a dense foam in which the bulla hangs suspended in five or more sets of ligaments. The pterygoid and peribullar [[Sinus (anatomy)|sinuses]] that form the cavity tend to be more developed in shallow water and riverine species than in [[Pelagic zone|pelagic]] Mysticeti.

These include the vaquita, which inhabits a small part of the [[Gulf of California]] and [[Hector's dolphin]], which lives in some coastal waters in New Zealand. [[River dolphin]] species live exclusively in fresh water. \n\nMany species inhabit specific latitudes, often in tropical or subtropical waters, such as [[Bryde's whale]] or [[Risso's dolphin]]. Others are found only in a specific body of water. The [[southern right whale dolphin]] and the [[hourglass dolphin]] live only in the [[Southern Ocean]]. The [[narwhal]] and the [[beluga whale|beluga]] live only in the Arctic Ocean. [[Sowerby's beaked whale]] and the [[Clymene dolphin]] exist only in the Atlantic and the [[Pacific white-sided dolphin]] and the [[Lissodelphis borealis|northern straight dolphin]] live only in the North Pacific.\n\nCosmopolitan species may be found in the Pacific, Atlantic and Indian Oceans.

Species such as sperm whales can dive to {{convert|3,000|m|ft|abbr=on}}, although more commonly {{convert|1,200|m|ft}}.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Scholander|first=Per Fredrik|title=Experimental investigations on the respiratory function in diving mammals and birds|year=1940|journal=Hvalraadets Skrifter|volume=22}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|author1=Bruno Cozzi|author2=Paola Bagnoli|author3=Fabio Acocella|author4=Maria Laura Costantino|title=Structure and biomechanical properties of the trachea of the striped dolphin Stenella coeruleoalba: Evidence for evolutionary adaptations to diving|journal=The Anatomical Record|volume=284|issue=1|pages=500\u2013510|year=2005|doi=10.1002/ar.a.20182|pmid=15791584}}</ref>\n\n=== Social relations ===\nMost whales are social animals, although a few species live in pairs or are solitary. A group, known as a pod, usually consists of ten to fifty animals, but on occasion, such as mass availability of food or during mating season, groups may encompass more than one thousand individuals. Inter-species socialization can occur.<ref name=mann>{{cite book|editor1=Janet Mann|editor2=Richard C. Connor|editor3=Peter L. Tyack|editor4=Hal Whitehead| display-editors = 3|title=Cetacean Societies: Field Study of Dolphins and Whales|publisher=University of Chicago}}</ref>\n\nPods have a fixed hierarchy, with the priority positions determined by biting, pushing or ramming. The behavior in the group is aggressive only in situations of stress such as lack of food, but usually it is peaceful. Contact swimming, mutual fondling and nudging are common. The playful behavior of the animals, which is manifested in air jumps, somersaults, surfing, or fin hitting, occurs more often than not in smaller cetaceans, such as dolphins and porpoises.<ref name=mann />\n\n=== Whale song ===\nMales in some baleen species communicate via [[Whale vocalization|whale song]], sequences of high pitched sounds. These \"songs\" can be heard for hundreds of kilometers. Each population generally shares a distinct song, which evolves over time. Sometimes, an individual can be identified by its distinctive vocals, such as the [[52-hertz whale]] that sings at a higher frequency than other whales. Some individuals are capable of generating over 600 distinct sounds.<ref name=\"mann\" /> In baleen species such as humpbacks, blues and fins, male-specific song is believed to be used to attract and display fitness to females.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Janik |first1=Vincent |title=Cetacean vocal learning and communication |journal=Current Opinion in Neurobiology |date=2014 |volume=28 |pages=60\u201365 |doi= 10.1016/j.conb.2014.06.010|pmid=25057816 }}</ref>\n\n=== Hunting ===\nPod groups also hunt, often with other species. Many species of dolphins accompany large tunas on hunting expeditions, following large schools of fish. The killer whale hunts in pods and targets belugas and even larger whales. Humpback whales, among others, form in collaboration [[bubble net|bubble carpets]] to herd krill or plankton into bait balls before lunging at them.<ref name=mann />\n\n=== Intelligence ===\n{{Main|Cetacean intelligence}}[[File:Whales Bubble Net Feeding-edit1.jpg|thumb|Bubble net feeding]]\n\nCetacea are known to teach, learn, cooperate, scheme and grieve.<ref name=\"wwwu\">{{cite news |last=Siebert |first=Charles |title=Watching Whales Watching Us |work=New York Times Magazine |date=8 July 2009 |accessdate=29 August 2015 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/07/12/magazine/12whales-t.html?pagewanted=all}}</ref>\n\nSmaller cetaceans, such as dolphins and porpoises, engage in complex play behavior, including such things as producing stable underwater [[toroid]]al air-core [[vortex]] rings or \"[[bubble ring]]s\". The two main methods of bubble ring production are rapid puffing of air into the water and allowing it to rise to the surface, forming a ring, or swimming repeatedly in a circle and then stopping to inject air into the [[Helix|helical]] vortex currents thus formed. They also appear to enjoy biting the vortex rings, so that they burst into many separate bubbles and then rise quickly to the surface. Whales produce bubble nets to aid in herding prey.<ref>{{cite journal |author1=Wiley, David|title=Underwater components of humpback whale bubble-net feeding behaviour |journal=Behaviour |volume=148 |issue=5 |pages=575\u2013602 |year=2011 |doi=10.1163/000579511X570893 |display-authors=etal|url=https://semanticscholar.org/paper/aa2f71f000dd10d66b779489d6883c31c065b050 }}</ref>\n\n[[File:Orca porpoising.jpg|thumb|Killer whale [[Cetacean surfacing behaviour#porpoising|porpoising]]]]\n\nLarger whales are also thought to engage in play. The southern right whale elevates its tail fluke above the water, remaining in the same position for a considerable time. This is known as \"sailing\". It appears to be a form of play and is most commonly seen off the coast of [[Argentina]] and [[South Africa]].<ref>{{cite book |last1=Carwardine |first1=M.

Self-awareness, although not well-defined, is believed to be a precursor to more advanced processes such as [[metacognition|metacognitive reasoning]] (thinking about thinking) that humans exploit. Cetaceans appear to possess self-awareness.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.livescience.com/4272-elephant-awareness-mirrors-humans.html | title=Elephant Self-Awareness Mirrors Humans |publisher=Live Science |date=30 October 2006 |accessdate=29 August 2015}}</ref> The most widely used test for self-awareness in animals is the [[mirror test]], in which a temporary dye is placed on an animal's body and the animal is then presented with a mirror. Researchers then explore whether the animal shows signs of self-recognition.<ref name=\"Mirror test\">{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2001/05/01/science/brainy-dolphins-pass-the-human-mirror-test.html |title=Mirror test |author=Derr, Mark |newspaper=New York Times |accessdate=3 August 2015|date=May 2001 }}</ref>\n\nCritics claim that the results of these tests are susceptible to the [[Clever Hans]] effect. This test is much less definitive than when used for [[primates]]. Primates can touch the mark or the mirror, while cetaceans cannot, making their alleged self-recognition behavior less certain. Skeptics argue that behaviors said to identify self-awareness resemble existing social behaviors, so researchers could be misinterpreting self-awareness for social responses. Advocates counter that the behaviors are different from normal responses to another individual. Cetaceans show less definitive behavior of self-awareness, because they have no pointing ability.<ref name=\"Mirror test\" />\n\nIn 1995, Marten and Psarakos used video to test dolphin self-awareness.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Marten|first1=Ken|last2=Psarakos|first2=Suchi|title=Using Self-View Television to Distinguish between Self-Examination and Social Behavior in the Bottlenose Dolphin (''Tursiops truncatus'')|journal=Consciousness and Cognition|volume=4|number=2|date=June 1995|doi=10.1006/ccog.1995.1026|pages=205\u2013224|pmid=8521259}}<!--|accessdate=5 September 2015--></ref> They showed dolphins real-time footage of themselves, recorded footage and another dolphin. They concluded that their evidence suggested self-awareness rather than social behavior. While this particular study has not been replicated, dolphins later \"passed\" the mirror test.<ref name=\"Mirror test\" />\n\n== Life history ==\n\n=== Reproduction and brooding ===\nMost cetaceans sexually mature at seven to 10 years. An exception to this is the [[La Plata dolphin]], which is sexually mature at two years, but lives only to about 20. The sperm whale reaches sexual maturity within about 20 years and a lifespan between 50 and 100 years.<ref name=\"mann\" />\n\nFor most species, reproduction is seasonal. [[Ovulation]] coincides with male [[fertility]]. This cycle is usually coupled with seasonal movements that can be observed in many species. Most toothed whales have no fixed bonds. In many species, females choose several partners during a season. Baleen whales are largely [[monogamous]] within each reproductive period.\n\nGestation ranges from 9 to 16 months. Duration is not necessarily a function of size. Porpoises and blue whales gestate for about 11 months. As with all mammals other than marsupials and monotremes, the embryo is fed by  the [[placenta]], an organ that draws nutrients from the mother\u2019s bloodstream. Mammals without placentas either lay minuscule eggs (monotremes) or bear minuscule offspring (marsupials).\n\nCetaceans usually bear one calf. In the case of twins, one usually dies, because the mother cannot produce sufficient milk for both. The fetus is positioned for a tail-first delivery, so that the risk of drowning during delivery is minimal. After birth, the mother carries the infant to the surface for its first breath. At birth they are about one-third of their adult length and tend to be independently active, comparable to terrestrial [[mammals]].\n\n==== Suckling ====\nLike other placental mammals, cetaceans give birth to well-developed calves and nurse them with milk from their [[mammary glands]]. When suckling, the mother actively splashes milk into the mouth of the calf, using the muscles of her mammary glands, as the calf has no lips. This milk usually has a high fat content, ranging from 16 to 46%, causing the calf to increase rapidly in size and weight.<ref name=\"mann\" />\n\nIn many small cetaceans, suckling lasts for about four months. In large species, it lasts for over a year and involves a strong bond between mother and offspring.\n\nThe mother is solely responsible for brooding. In some species, so-called \"aunts\" occasionally suckle the young.\n\nThis reproductive strategy provides a few offspring that have a high survival rate.\n\n=== Lifespan ===\nAmong cetaceans, whales are distinguished by an unusual longevity compared to other higher mammals. Some species, such as the [[bowhead whale]] (''Balaena mysticetus''), can reach over 200 years. Based on the annual rings of the bony [[otic capsule]], the age of the oldest known specimen is a male determined to be 211 years at the time of death.<ref>{{cite journal|author1=John C George|author2=Jeffrey Bada|author3=Judith Zeh|author3-link= Judy Zeh |author4=Laura Scott|author5=Stephen E Brown|author6=Todd O'Hara|author7=Robert Suydam|title=Age and growth estimates of bowhead whales (''Balaena mysticetus'') via aspartic acid racemization|journal=Canadian Journal of Zoology|year=1999|volume=77|issue=4|doi=10.1139/z99-015|pages=571\u2013580}}<!--|accessdate=5 September 2015--></ref>\n\n=== Death ===\n{{Main|Whale fall}}\nUpon death, whale carcasses fall to the deep ocean and provide a substantial habitat for marine life.

Initially, organisms such as [[shark]]s and [[hagfish]] scavenge the soft tissues at a rapid rate over a period of months and as long as two years. This is followed by the colonization of bones and surrounding sediments (which contain organic matter) by enrichment opportunists, such as [[crustaceans]] and [[polychaetes]], throughout a period of years. Finally, sulfophilic bacteria reduce the bones releasing [[hydrogen sulfide]] enabling the growth of [[chemoautotrophic]] organisms, which in turn, support organisms such as mussels, clams, limpets and sea snails. This stage may last for decades and supports a rich assemblage of species, averaging 185 per site.<ref name=\"Smith&Baco2003\" /><ref>{{cite journal |author1=Fujiwara, Yoshihiro|title=Three-year investigations into sperm whale-fall ecosystems in Japan |journal=Marine Ecology |volume=28 |issue=1 |pages=219\u2013230|date=16 February 2007|display-authors=etal |doi=10.1111/j.1439-0485.2007.00150.x|bibcode=2007MarEc..28..219F}}</ref>\n\n== Disease ==\n[[Brucellosis]] affects almost all mammals.

Both groups had already developed the typical anatomical features of today's whales, such as hearing. Life in the water for a formerly terrestrial creature required significant adjustments such as the fixed bulla, which replaces the mammalian [[eardrum]], as well as sound-conducting elements for submerged directional hearing. Their wrists were stiffened and probably contributed to the typical build of flippers. The hind legs existed, however, but were significantly reduced in size and with a vestigial pelvis connection.<ref name=\"Thewissen\" />\n\n==== Transition from land to sea ====\n[[File:Adult female and fetal Maiacetus.jpg|thumb|Fossil of a ''Maiacetus'' (red, beige skull) with fetus (blue, red teeth) shortly before the end of gestation <ref name=\"Gingerich PD\" />]]\nThe fossil record traces the gradual transition from terrestrial to aquatic life. The regression of the hind limbs allowed greater flexibility of the spine. This made it possible for whales to move around with the vertical tail hitting the water. The front legs transformed into flippers, costing them their mobility on land.\n\nOne of the oldest members of ancient cetaceans ([[Archaeoceti]]) is ''[[Pakicetus]]'' from the Middle Eocene. This is an animal the size of a wolf, whose skeleton is known only partially. It had functioning legs and lived near the shore. This suggests the animal could still move on land. The long snout had [[Carnivore|carnivorous]] dentition.<ref name=\"Thewissen\"/>\n\nThe transition from land to sea dates to about 49 million years ago, with the ''[[Ambulocetus]]'' (\"running whale\"), discovered in [[Pakistan]].

The body was streamlined and delicate with extended hand and foot bones. The merged pelvic [[lumbar spine]] was present, making it possible to support the floating movement of the tail.

This activity has gone on since the [[Stone Age]].\n\nIn the [[Middle Ages]], reasons for whaling included their [[whale meat|meat]], [[whale oil|oil]] usable as fuel and the jawbone, which was used in house construction. At the end of the Middle Ages, early whaling fleets aimed at [[baleen whales]], such as [[bowhead whales|bowheads]]. In the 16th and 17th centuries, the Dutch fleet had about 300 whaling ships with 18,000 crewmen.\n\nIn the 18th and 19th centuries, baleen whales especially were hunted for their [[baleen]], which was used as a replacement for wood, or in products requiring strength and flexibility such as [[corset]]s and [[crinoline]] skirts. In addition, the [[spermaceti]] found in the [[sperm whale]] was used as a machine lubricant and the [[ambergris]] as a material for pharmaceutical and perfume industries. In the second half of the 19th century, the explosive [[harpoon]] was invented, leading to a massive increase in the catch size.\n\nLarge ships were used as \"mother\" ships for the whale handlers. In the first half of the 20th century, whales were of great importance as a supplier of raw materials. Whales were intensively hunted during this time; in the 1930s, 30,000 whales were killed. This increased to over 40,000 animals per year up to the 1960s, when stocks of large baleen whales collapsed.\n\nMost hunted whales are now threatened, with some great whale populations exploited to the brink of extinction. Atlantic and Korean [[gray whale]] populations were completely eradicated and the [[North Atlantic right whales|North Atlantic right whale]] population fell to some 300-600. The [[blue whale]] population is estimated to be around 14,000.\n\nThe first efforts to protect whales came in 1931. Some particularly endangered species, such as the [[humpback whale]] (which then numbered about 100 animals), were placed under international protection and the first protected areas were established. In 1946, the [[International Whaling Commission]] (IWC) was established, to monitor and secure whale stocks. Whaling of 14 large species for commercial purposes was prohibited worldwide by this organization from 1985 to 2005, though some countries do not honor the prohibition.\n\nThe stocks of species such as humpback and blue whales have recovered, though they are still threatened. The United States Congress passed the [[Marine Mammal Protection Act of 1972]] sustain the marine mammal population. It prohibits the taking of marine mammals except for several hundred per year taken in Alaska. Japanese whaling ships are allowed to hunt whales of different species for ostensibly scientific purposes.\n\n[[Aboriginal whaling]] is still permitted. About 1,200 pilot whales were taken in the [[Faroe Islands]] in 2017.,<ref name=\"faroe\">{{Cite web |url=http://heimabeiti.fo/default.asp?menu=400 |title=Hagar & sey\u00f0amark |website=heimabeiti.fo |access-date=2018-04-07}}</ref> and about 900 [[narwhal]]s and 800 [[beluga whale|belugas]] per year are taken in Alaska, Canada, Greenland, and Siberia. About 150 minke are taken in Greenland per year, 120 gray whales in Siberia and 50 bowheads in Alaska, as aboriginal whaling, besides the 600 minke taken commercially by Norway, 300 minke and 100 sei taken by Japan and up to 100 fin whales taken by Iceland.<ref name=\"iwcatch\">{{Cite web |url=https://iwc.int/total-catches |title=Total Catches |website=iwc.int |language=en |access-date=2018-04-07}}</ref> Iceland and Norway do not recognize the ban and operate commercial whaling. Norway and Japan are committed to ending the ban.\n\nDolphins and other smaller cetaceans are sometimes hunted in an activity known as dolphin drive hunting. This is accomplished by driving a pod together with boats, usually into a bay or onto a beach. Their escape is prevented by closing off the route to the ocean with other boats or nets. Dolphins are hunted this way in several places around the world, including the [[Solomon Islands]], the [[Faroe Islands]], [[Peru]] and [[Japan]] (the most well-known practitioner). Dolphins are mostly hunted for their [[whale meat|meat]], though some end up in [[dolphinarium|dolphinaria]]. Despite the controversy thousands of dolphins are caught in drive hunts each year.\n\n==== Fishing ====\n{{See also|Cetacean bycatch}}\n[[File:Domino whale-bone hg.jpg|thumb|[[Dominoes]] made of baleen]]\nDolphin pods often reside near large tuna shoals. This is known to fishermen, who look for dolphins to catch tuna. Dolphins are much easier to spot from a distance than tuna, since they regularly breathe. The fishermen pull their nets hundreds of meters wide in a circle around the dolphin groups, in the expectation that they will net a tuna shoal. When the nets are pulled together, the dolphins become entangled under water and drown. Line fisheries in larger rivers are threats to [[river dolphins]].\n\nA greater threat than by-catch for small cetaceans is targeted hunting. In Southeast Asia, they are sold as fish-replacement to locals, since the region's edible fish promise higher revenues from exports. In the Mediterranean, small cetaceans are targeted to ease pressure on edible fish.<ref name=\"wdcs\" />\n\n==== Strandings ====\n{{Main|Cetacean stranding}}\nA stranding is when a cetacean leaves the water to lie on a beach. In some cases, groups of whales strand together. The best known are mass strandings of [[pilot whale]]s and sperm whales. [[Cetacean stranding|Stranded]] cetaceans usually die, because their as much as {{convert|90|MT|ST}} body weight compresses their lungs or breaks their ribs. Smaller whales can die of heatstroke because of their thermal insulation.\n\nThe causes are not clear. Possible reasons for mass beachings are:<ref name=\"wdcs\" />\n* toxic contaminants\n* debilitating parasites (in the respiratory tract, brain or middle ear)\n* infections (bacterial or viral)\n* flight from predators (including humans)\n* social bonds within a group, so that the pod follows a stranded animal\n* disturbance of their magnetic senses by natural anomalies in the Earth's magnetic field\n* injuries\n* [[Noise pollution#Wildlife|noise pollution]] by shipping traffic, seismic surveys and military sonar experiments\n\nSince 2000, whale strandings frequently occurred following military [[sonar]] testing. In December 2001, the US Navy admitted partial responsibility for the beaching and the deaths of several marine mammals in March 2000. The coauthor of the interim report stated that animals killed by active sonar of some Navy ships were injured. Generally, underwater noise, which is still on the increase, is increasingly tied to strandings; because it impairs communication and sense of direction.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Schrope, Mark. |title=Whale deaths caused by US Navy's sonar |journal=Nature |volume=415 |issue=106 |pages=106 |year=2003  |doi=10.1038/415106a|bibcode = 2002Natur.415..106S |pmid=11805797}}</ref>\n\n[[Climate change]] influences the major wind systems and ocean currents, which also lead to cetacean strandings. Researchers studying strandings on the Tasmanian coast from 1920\u20132002 found that greater strandings occurred at certain time intervals. Years with increased strandings were associated with severe storms, which initiated cold water flows close to the coast. In nutrient-rich, cold water, cetaceans expect large prey animals, so they follow the cold water currents into shallower waters, where the risk is higher for strandings. Whales and dolphins who live in pods may accompany sick or debilitated pod members into shallow water, stranding them at low tide. Once stranded, large whales are crushed by their own body weight, if they cannot quickly return to the water. In addition, body temperature regulation is compromised.{{Citation needed|date=March 2016}}\n\n==== Environmental hazards ====\n{{See also|Marine mammals and sonar}}\n{{Quote box|quote=Worldwide, use of active sonar has been linked to about 50 marine mammal strandings between 1996 and 2006.

There, it is called Ketos, a term that initially included all large marine animals. From this was derived the Roman word for whale, [[Cetus (mythology)|Cetus]]. Other names were ph\u00e1laina ([[Aristotle]], [[Latin]] form of ballaena) for the female and, with an ironic characteristic style, musculus (Mouse) for the male. [[North Sea]] whales were called Physeter, which was meant for the sperm whale ''Physter macrocephalus''. Whales are described in particular by Aristotle, [[Pliny the Elder|Pliny]] and [[Ambrose]]. All mention both live birth and suckling. Pliny describes the problems associated with the lungs with spray tubes and Ambrose claimed that large whales would take their young into their mouth to protect them.\n\nIn the [[Bible]] especially, the leviathan plays a role as a [[sea monster]]. The essence, which features a giant crocodile or a dragon and a whale, was created according to the Bible by God<ref>{{Bibleverse|Psalms|104:26}}</ref> and should again be destroyed by him.<ref>{{Bibleverse|Psalms|74:14}}</ref><ref>{{Bibleverse|Isaiah|27:1}}.</ref> In the [[Book of Job]], the leviathan is described in more detail.<ref>{{Bibleverse|Job|40:25}}</ref><ref>{{Bibleverse|Job|41:26}}</ref>\n\nIn Jonah there is a more recognizable description of a whale alongside the prophet [[Jonah]], who, on his flight from the city of [[Nineveh]] is swallowed by a whale.\n\nDolphins are mentioned far more often than whales. Aristotle discusses the sacred animals of the Greeks in his ''[[Historia Animalium]]'' and gives details of their role as aquatic animals. The Greeks admired the dolphin as a \"king of the aquatic animals\" and referred to them erroneously as fish. Its intelligence was apparent both in its ability to escape from fishnets and in its collaboration with fishermen.\n\nRiver dolphins are known from the [[Ganges]] and \u2013 erroneously \u2013 the [[Nile]]. In the latter case it was equated with sharks and catfish. Supposedly they attacked even [[crocodile]]s.\n\n[[Dolphins in mythology|Dolphins appear in Greek mythology]]. Because of their intelligence, they rescued multiple people from drowning. They were said to love music \u2013 probably not least because of their own song \u2013 they saved, in the legends, famous musicians such as [[Arion]] of [[Lesbos]] from [[Mithymna|Methymna]] or [[\\|Kairanos]] from Miletus. Because of their mental faculties, dolphins were considered for the god [[Dionysus]].\n[[File:Cetus constellation map.png|thumb|right|Constellation Cetus]]\nDolphins belong to the domain of [[Poseidon]] and led him to his wife [[Amphitrite]]. Dolphins are associated with other gods, such as [[Apollo]], Dionysus and [[Aphrodite]]. The Greeks paid tribute to both whales and dolphins with their own constellation. The constellation of the [[Cetus|Whale]] (Ketos, lat. Cetus) is located south of the Dolphin (Delphi, lat. Delphinus) north of the [[zodiac]].\n\nAncient art often included dolphin representations, including the Cretan [[Minoan civilization|Minoans]]. Later they appeared on reliefs, gems, lamps, coins, mosaics and gravestones. A particularly popular representation is that of Arion or the [[Taras (mythology)]] riding on a dolphin. In early [[Christian art]], the dolphin is a popular motif, at times used as a symbol of [[Christ]].\n\n==== Middle Ages to the 19th century ====\n{{See also|History of Whaling|Cryptid whales}}\n[[St. Brendan]] described in his travel story ''Navigatio Sancti Brendani'' an encounter with a whale, between the years 565\u2013573. He described how he and his companions entered a treeless island, which turned out to be a giant whale, which he called Jasconicus. He met this whale seven years later and rested on his back.\n\nMost descriptions of large whales from this time until the whaling era, beginning in the 17th century, were of beached whales, which resembled no other animal. This was particularly true for the sperm whale, the most frequently stranded in larger groups. [[Raymond Gilmore]] documented seventeen sperm whales in the estuary of the Elbe from 1723 to 1959 and thirty-one animals on the coast of Great Britain in 1784. In 1827, a blue whale beached itself off the coast of Ostend. Whales were used as attractions in museums and traveling exhibitions.\n[[File:La Baleine.jpg|thumb|left|Depiction of baleen whaling, 1840]]\n[[File:Im Februar 1598 an der holl\u00e4ndischen K\u00fcste gestrandeter Walfisch.jpg|thumb|right|Stranded sperm whale engraving, 1598]]\nWhalers from the 17th to 19th centuries depicted whales in drawings and recounted tales of their occupation. Although they knew that whales were harmless giants, they described battles with harpooned animals. These included descriptions of sea monsters, including huge whales, sharks, sea snakes, giant squid and octopuses.\n\nAmong the first whalers who described their experiences on whaling trips was Captain [[William Scoresby]] from Great Britain, who published the book ''Northern Whale Fishery'', describing the hunt for northern baleen whales. This was followed by [[Thomas Beale]], a British surgeon, in his book ''Some observations on the natural history of the sperm whale'' in 1835; and Frederick Debell Bennett's ''The tale of a whale hunt'' in 1840. Whales were described in narrative literature and paintings, most famously in the novels ''[[Moby-Dick|Moby Dick]]'' by [[Herman Melville]] and ''[[20,000 Leagues Under the Sea]]'' by [[Jules Verne]].\n\nBaleen was used to make vessel components such as the bottom of a bucket in the Scottish National Museum. The [[Norsemen]] crafted ornamented plates from baleen, sometimes interpreted as [[ironing]] boards.\n\nIn the Canadian Arctic (east coast) in Punuk and [[Thule]] culture (1000\u20131600 C.E.),<ref>{{cite journal|title=The circumpolar zone|last1=Cunliffe|first1=B.|last2=Gosden|first2=C.|last3=Joyce|first3=R.|journal=The Oxford Handbook of Archaeology}}</ref> I baleen was used to construct houses in place of wood as roof support for winter houses, with half of the building buried under the ground.

They transformed from monsters into creatures of wonder, as science revealed them to be intelligent and peaceful animals. Hunting was replaced by whale and dolphin tourism. This change is reflected in films and novels. For example, the protagonist of the series [[Flipper (1995 TV series)|Flipper]] was a bottle-nose dolphin. The TV series [[SeaQuest DSV]] (1993\u20131996), the movies [[Free Willy]], [[Star Trek IV: The Voyage Home]] and the book series [[The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy]] by [[Douglas Adams]] are examples.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.movieretriever.com/videohound_lists/90895/Whales|title=Movie Retriever: Whales|author=unknown|work=movieretriever.com|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151015214719/http://www.movieretriever.com/videohound_lists/90895/Whales|archivedate=2015-10-15}}</ref>\n\nThe study of [[Whale vocalization|whale song]] also produced a popular album, ''[[Songs of the Humpback Whale (album)|Songs of the Humpback Whale]]''.\n\n=== Captivity ===\nWhales and dolphins have been kept in captivity for use in education, research and entertainment since the 19th century.\n\n==== Belugas ====\n{{Main|Beluga whale#Captivity}}\n[[Beluga whale]]s were the first whales to be kept in captivity.

[[Bottlenose dolphin]]s are the most common, as they are relatively easy to train, have a long lifespan in captivity and have a friendly appearance. Bottlenose dolphins live in captivity across the world, though exact numbers are hard to determine. Other species kept in captivity are [[Atlantic spotted dolphin|spotted dolphins]], [[false killer whale]]s and [[common dolphin]]s, [[Commerson's dolphin]]s, as well as [[rough-toothed dolphin]]s, but all in much lower numbers. There are also fewer than ten [[pilot whale]]s, [[Amazon river dolphin]]s, [[Risso's dolphin]]s, [[spinner dolphin]]s, or [[tucuxi]] in captivity. Two unusual and rare [[hybrid (biology)|hybrid]] dolphins, known as [[wolphins]], are kept at [[Sea Life Park]] in [[Hawaii]], which is a cross between a bottlenose dolphin and a [[false killer whale]]. Also, two [[Common dolphin|common]]/bottlenose hybrids reside in captivity at [[Discovery Cove]] and [[SeaWorld San Diego]].\n\nIn repeated attempts in the 1960s and 1970s, [[narwhal]]s kept in captivity died within months. A breeding pair of [[pygmy right whale]]s were retained in a netted area. They were eventually released in South Africa. In 1971, SeaWorld captured a California gray whale calf in Mexico at [[Ojo de Liebre Lagoon|Scammon's Lagoon]]. The calf, later named Gigi, was separated from her mother using a form of lasso attached to her flukes. Gigi was displayed at [[SeaWorld San Diego]] for a year. She was then released with a radio beacon affixed to her back; however, contact was lost after three weeks. Gigi was the first captive baleen whale. JJ, another [[gray whale]] calf, was kept at [[SeaWorld San Diego]]. JJ was an orphaned calf that beached itself in April 1997 and was transported two miles to SeaWorld. The {{convert|680|kg|lbs}} calf was a popular attraction and behaved normally, despite separation from his mother.

The Sagas are interesting because they mix ordinary domestic stories about farms and families with sudden bits of supernatural stuff, featuring ghosts and trolls. The fantasy never takes over, but it never goes away either; it\u2019s just taken for granted by the people as something on the margin of their lives. I was keen to try a saga of my own, which would explore themes of story-telling and family life, and began jotting down a few fragments of story.\"\n</blockquote>\n\n==Plot==\nHalli Sveinsson loves to hear stories from the days when the valley was a wild and dangerous place, besieged by the bloodthirsty [[Trow (folklore)|Trow]]. Now farming has taken over from fighting Trows, and to Halli's disappointment, heroics seem a thing of the past. But when a practical joke rekindles an old blood feud, he sees a chance for a daring quest of his own.\n\nThe tale begins with the Battle of the Rock being told to a child. This was when twelve heroes of the valley joined together to fight the ruthless Trows (man eating monsters) who were devastating the land. Taking up positions on a large rock, they were finally attacked at dusk by the Trows, who they fended off all night. In the morning, when the people returned to see what had happened, all were dead, Trows and Heroes, including Svein, their leader.\n\nThe heroes were buried under cairns along the borders of the valley with their swords, so that, even in death, they could guard the boundaries from the Trows. As long as no one crosses the cairn border, the legends say, no Trows can enter the Valley.\n\nMany years later, Halli is born. He is a very short, stout, and headstrong boy who longs for the days of the Heroes, when a man could fight for what he wanted and take what he could win.  He longs to leave the valley, which is now ruled by a Council of women who demand peace and equality in the land. They have outlawed swords and other weapons to discourage wars. Halli looks very much like his uncle Brodir, whom he adores. He is the third and last child in his family, who are Arnkel, his father and Arbiter of Svein's House, Astrid, his mother and Law-Giver of Svein's House, Leif, his older brother who is immediately in line for the Arbiter after Arnkel, Gudny, his sister and Brodir, who is the only relative who seems to get along with him.\n\nWhen his uncle is murdered by the rival house of Hakonssons, Halli sets off to avenge him. Finally, he thinks that he will have a hero's quest of his own.\n\nBut during his journey, Halli realizes that he isn't the pitiless avenging killer that he thought he could be. His interference and thirst for revenge leads two men to their deaths, and he becomes sick with guilt. He returns home to his relieved yet angry family, and his distrusting and fearful fellow villagers. His actions eventually lead to an attack by the House of Hakon, and he alone can accept responsibility and take charge of his defenseless village. \n\nThe enemy arrives and they have an obvious advantage&mdash;swords. Halli realizes that his peoples' only hope is if he lures the enemy in the dark past the cairn boundaries.  He does so with the help of his friend, Aud Arnsdottir, and to his relief, it works. The Hakonssons are eaten by monsters in the moorlands. However, Halli and Aud also come under attack. Much like the heroes of old, they take their last stand on a large rock and await the unseen monsters. \n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*[http://www.jonathanstroud.com/journal.html Jonathan Stroud's journal]\n\n\n\n{{Jonathan Stroud}}\n\n[[Category:2009 British novels]]\n[[Category:Fantasy novels]]\n[[Category:Novels by Jonathan Stroud]]\n", "text_old": "{{Multiple issues|\n{{one source|date=November 2016}}\n{{primary sources|date=November 2016}}\n}}\n{{infobox book | <!-- See [[Wikipedia:WikiProject Novels]] or [[Wikipedia:WikiProject Books]] -->\n| name          = Heroes of the Valley\n| title_orig    =\n| translator    =\n| image         = Heroes of the valley stroud.jpg\n| caption       = First edition cover\n| author        = Jonathan Stroud\n| illustrator   = Douglas Smith\n| cover_artist  = [http://www.petrolad.com petrolad.com]\n| country       =\n| language      =\n| series        =\n| genre         = [[Fantasy]]\n| publisher     = [[Hyperion Books]]\n| pub_date      = 2009\n| english_pub_date =\n| media_type    = Print\n| pages         =\n| isbn =  978-1-4231-0966-2\n| congress      = PZ7.S92475 He 2009\n| oclc          = 294861087\n| preceded_by   =\n| followed_by   =\n}}\n\n'''''Heroes of the Valley''''' is a 2009 [[fantasy]] [[adventure fiction|adventure]] novel written by English writer [[Jonathan Stroud]].

Much like the heroes of old, they take their last stand on a large rock and await the unseen monsters. \n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*[http://www.jonathanstroud.com/journal.html Jonathan Stroud's journal]\n\n\n\n{{Jonathan Stroud}}\n\n[[Category:2009 British novels]]\n[[Category:Fantasy novels]]\n[[Category:Novels by Jonathan Stroud]]\n", "name_user": "BD2412", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200etop:Fixinglinks to disambiguation pages, replaced:Hyperion Books\u2192Hyperion Books", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heroes_of_the_Valley"}

The novel and its sequels are published by [[Hachette Books#Hyperion Books|Hyperion Books]] as a tie-in to the U.S. crime series ''[[Castle (TV series)|Castle]]'', and are attributed to that show's lead character [[Richard Castle]]. ''Heat Wave'' was published in 2009 and has been followed by ''Naked Heat'' (2010), ''Heat Rises'' (2011), ''Frozen Heat'' (2012), ''Deadly Heat'' (2013), ''Raging Heat'' (2014) and ''Driving Heat'' (2015).\n\n==Premise==\n{{Main article|Castle (TV series)}}\nRichard Castle is a best-selling author who has published the final book in his successful series, in which he killed off the main character after writing the books became too much \"like work\". He is desperately searching for a new muse.

''Heat Wave'' is released at the start of the second season which aired just before the actual release of the book. Because of its success, ABC has released even more books, including a Derrick Storm trilogy and Derrick Storm graphic novels.\n\n==Plot summary==\nThe title of the book refers to a heat wave that gripped the city, the heat that is inside the characters\u2019 attraction for each other, and the character\u2019s surname. Castle\u2019s protagonist is NYPD homicide detective, Nikki Heat. Ms Heat is attractive, tough and means business when she\u2019s on a case. Ms Heat is good at her job and is the leader of her team investigating murders. Heat\u2019s boss, the commissioner, assigns Jameson Rook, a reporter, to be attached to her to do research on his article. Rook proves to be a challenge to Heat as he has a mind of his own.\n\nAs much as Heat hates Rook, she also feels a compelling force that draws him to her. Heat feels the heat between them. Ms Heat tries to handle her professional work, as well as answer to the call of nature as she falls for her handsome, magnetic shadow. In her work, Heat has to dig into the case of a real estate millionaire who fell to his death. His widowed wife was attacked but survived the confrontation.\n\n==Characters==\n* '''Detective Nikki Heat''' is the lead character in Richard Castle's Nikki Heat book series. Heat is \"loosely\" based on the fictional NYPD detective [[Kate Beckett]], possessing a similar backstory, in that her decision to become a detective was motivated by the death of someone close to her - although Heat has a niece and siblings that Beckett lacks - and the first case she investigates is adapted from several real cases Castle helped Beckett solve. Heat is assisted by her partner and sometime lover, journalist Jameson Rook. In addition, her colleagues Detectives Raley and Ochoa also work with her on cases.\n* '''Jameson Rook''' is a fictional character that Richard Castle created for his Nikki Heat series of crime novels. He is a famous magazine journalist who shadows the main character, Detective Nikki Heat, as well as being her on-again off-again love interest. The character moonlights as a romance novelist under the pen name Victoria St. Clair. He is based on [[Richard Castle]] himself and the way he works with Kate Beckett.

In flashbacks, Charming must stop Snow from killing the queen.\n\nIt was co-written by [[Ian B. Goldberg]] and [[Andrew Chambliss]], while [[Dean White (director)|Dean White]] directed.\n\n==Plot==\n===Opening sequence===\nJiminy Cricket waves to us from in the forest.\n\n===In the characters' past===\nIn the Enchanted Forest, King George's men catch up with Prince Charming<!-- His name is not James, that is his twin brother's name that Charming assumed. Charming's real name has not been divulged. --> ([[Joshua Dallas|Josh Dallas]]) and Red Riding Hood ([[Meghan Ory]]). To cover the prince's escape, Red throws off her cloak under the full moon, which lets her transform into the wolf. Back in the cottage, Snow White ([[Ginnifer Goodwin]]) is humming \"[[With a Smile and a Song (song)|With a Smile and a Song]],\" seemingly content, until she spots a bluebird, which she swats violently. Grumpy ([[Lee Arenberg]]) enters to ask her to come to dinner, but it turns out that the dwarves have arranged an intervention with the help of Jiminy Cricket ([[Raphael Sbarge]]). They explain to Snow that she has been angry and unfriendly since she drank the amnesia potion. Snow blames her ire on the Evil Queen ([[Lana Parrilla]]), and decides to take revenge on her instead. Snow learns that the Queen will soon be en route to her summer palace.\n\nGrumpy hopes to find a potion that will reverse Snow's predicament, but is told by Rumpelstiltskin ([[Robert Carlyle]]) that \"no potion can bring back true love,\" saying that \"if you can bottle love, you can do ''anything''.\" Snow tells Rumpelstiltskin that she does not desire to have her love back anyway, but instead wants his help in killing the Queen, so he gives her a magical bow and arrow. After Snow has left, Charming asks Rumpelstiltskin to undo the potion. Rumpelstiltskin reminds him that true love's kiss can break any spell and gives him a map of Snow's whereabouts in exchange for Charming's cloak. Hours later in the woods, Charming ambushes her from behind, kissing her passionately. However, Snow still does not remember who he is, and knocks him unconscious and ties him to a tree. Moments later Jiminy arrives and sets Charming free, then mentions that Snow is not going to remember who Charming is until she remembers herself.\n\nSnow prepares to strike the Queen riding out in the open but Charming dives into the arrow's path taking it in the shoulder. Charming reminds Snow that he would die for her, which Snow is touched by. He then kisses her again and she begins to remember, but their reunion is short-lived as King George's army finds Charming and Snow, as Snow is shoved away while Charming is put into a moving prison. Snow swears she will find him and as she returns to the Dwarfs' cottage to apologize for her actions towards them, the dwarves forgive her and agree to help with their plans to rescue Charming. Meanwhile, Rumpelstiltskin takes a hair from Charming's cloak and pairs it with Snow's hair, then bottles it successfully, labeling it \"True Love.\"\n\n===In Storybrooke===\nAt the Sheriff's office, [[Emma Swan]] ([[Jennifer Morrison]]), despite believing Mary Margaret's (Goodwin) innocence in Kathryn's ([[Anastasia Griffith]]) murder, photographs Mary Margaret for her mug shots. Regina (Parrilla) joins the two as Emma questions Mary Margaret. Emma pulls out the box that the heart was found in. To Mary Margaret's surprise, it is her jewelry box and states it must have been stolen. Regina states that she does not believe her. Henry ([[Jared S. Gilmore]]) says that Regina has a motive: she hates Snow White. Emma finds no signs of a break-in, but hears rattling coming from the heating vent. Upon opening it, she finds a hunter's knife inside, which matches the weapon that was used in the murder.\n\nLater on at Granny's, August ([[Eion Bailey]]) approaches Henry to talk to him. August tells Henry that he believes that his book could be more than just stories. August says he has come to make people like Emma believe, but Emma won't go off of blind faith; she needs proof. August then hints that the answers to Henry's problems are instead in the book itself. Despite Emma's reservations about Mr. Gold (Carlyle), Mary Margaret hires him as her lawyer. Later, Henry finds the ring of keys in Regina's office and shows them to Emma, telling her that he thinks Regina used the keys to get into their apartment to steal the jewelry box and plant the hunting knife. Emma has a hard time believing him until Henry uses one of the keys to open the door.\n\nMeanwhile, David (Dallas) speaks with Regina, saying that he believes in Mary Margaret's innocence. Regina tells him that everyone has a dark side. David accuses himself, blaming his blackouts. During a session with Archie (Sbarge), David goes under hypnosis to remember what happened during the blackouts, and has a flashback to the Enchanted Forest, where he is telling Snow not to murder the Evil Queen. He tells Mary Margaret about the vision but doesn't realize that this is a flashback to the Enchanted Forest, not the Storybrooke woods. When he asks Mary Margaret whether or not she killed Kathryn, Mary Margaret tells him to leave, upset that he does not believe her. Not long after the confrontation, Mary Margaret discovers a key in her cell. Emma tells Mary Margaret that the DNA test results came back and the heart was Kathryn's, but tells Mary Margaret she believes Mary Margaret is being framed. However, Emma states that they must keep this idea a secret in order to have an advantage over Regina. Afterwards, Emma approaches Mr. Gold for help in the case, determined to prove that Regina is behind the murder. At the end of the episode, Mary Margaret's jail cell is shown to be empty.\n\n==Production==\n\"Heart of Darkness\" was co-written by [[Andrew Chambliss]] and [[Ian B.

August tells Henry that he believes that his book could be more than just stories. August says he has come to make people like Emma believe, but Emma won't go off of blind faith; she needs proof. August then hints that the answers to Henry's problems are instead in the book itself. Despite Emma's reservations about Mr. Gold (Carlyle), Mary Margaret hires him as her lawyer. Later, Henry finds the ring of keys in Regina's office and shows them to Emma, telling her that he thinks Regina used the keys to get into their apartment to steal the jewelry box and plant the hunting knife. Emma has a hard time believing him until Henry uses one of the keys to open the door.\n\nMeanwhile, David (Dallas) speaks with Regina, saying that he believes in Mary Margaret's innocence. Regina tells him that everyone has a dark side. David accuses himself, blaming his blackouts. During a session with Archie (Sbarge), David goes under hypnosis to remember what happened during the blackouts, and has a flashback to the Enchanted Forest, where he is telling Snow not to murder the Evil Queen. He tells Mary Margaret about the vision but doesn't realize that this is a flashback to the Enchanted Forest, not the Storybrooke woods. When he asks Mary Margaret whether or not she killed Kathryn, Mary Margaret tells him to leave, upset that he does not believe her. Not long after the confrontation, Mary Margaret discovers a key in her cell. Emma tells Mary Margaret that the DNA test results came back and the heart was Kathryn's, but tells Mary Margaret she believes Mary Margaret is being framed. However, Emma states that they must keep this idea a secret in order to have an advantage over Regina. Afterwards, Emma approaches Mr. Gold for help in the case, determined to prove that Regina is behind the murder. At the end of the episode, Mary Margaret's jail cell is shown to be empty.\n\n==Production==\n\"Heart of Darkness\" was co-written by [[Andrew Chambliss]] and [[Ian B.

The judge, however, believed that \u201cConnecting Asgari to the Iranian government because of this paper would be akin to connecting a chemistry professor at the Ohio State University\u2019s Columbus campus to the American government because an astronomy graduate student at Ohio State\u2019s Mansfield campus once did commercial telescope research that NASA could conceivably use,\u201d. The Federal judge, Mr. Gwin also wrote that \u201cmere employment as a professor at a state and privately supported university does not create probable cause. and that that Asgari\u2019s November 2012 visa application also stated his visit was, at least in part, for business reasons <ref name=\"AP\" />.\n\n== Detention in the US ==\nAlthough the US government lost its case charges (trade secret stealing and visa fraud), Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) has kept him indefinitely detained since the trial.

Development in this region is restricted by the [[Metropolitan Green Belt]]. Other large settlements include the county town of [[Aylesbury]], [[Marlow, Buckinghamshire|Marlow]] in the south near the [[River Thames|Thames]] and [[Princes Risborough]] in the west near Oxford. Some areas without direct rail links to London, such as around the old county town of [[Buckingham]] and near [[Olney, Buckinghamshire|Olney]] in the northeast, are much less populous. The largest town is [[Milton Keynes]] in the northeast, which with the surrounding area is administered as a [[Borough of Milton Keynes|unitary authority]] separately to the rest of Buckinghamshire. The remainder of the county is administered by [[Buckinghamshire County Council]] as a [[non-metropolitan county]], and four district councils. In national elections, Buckinghamshire is considered a reliable supporter of the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]].\n\nA large part of the [[Chiltern Hills]], an [[Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty]], runs through the south of the county and attracts many walkers and cyclists from London. In this area older buildings are often made from local flint and red brick. Many parts of the county are quite affluent and like many areas around London this has led to high housing costs: several reports have identified the market town of [[Beaconsfield]] as having among the highest property prices outside London.<ref name=\"Beaconsfield cost\">{{cite web|last1=Spence|first1=Graham|title=Beaconsfield is the most expensive market town in England|url=http://www.getbucks.co.uk/news/local-news/beaconsfield-most-expensive-market-town-8257800|website=Get Bucks|accessdate=15 December 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151222103912/http://www.getbucks.co.uk/news/local-news/beaconsfield-most-expensive-market-town-8257800|archive-date=22 December 2015|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=How expensive are the houses in your street?

To the north of the county lies rolling countryside in the [[Vale of Aylesbury]] and around the [[River Great Ouse|Great Ouse]]. The [[River Thames|Thames]] forms part of the county's southwestern boundary. Notable service amenities in the county are [[Pinewood Film Studios]], [[Dorney Lake|Dorney rowing lake]] and part of [[Silverstone Circuit|Silverstone race track]] on the Northamptonshire border. Many national companies have head-offices or major centres in Milton Keynes. Heavy industry and quarrying is limited, with agriculture predominating after service industries.\n\n==History==\n{{Main|History of Buckinghamshire}}\n[[File:Buckingham-215x334.jpg|thumb|left|Map of Bucks (1904)]]\n\nThe name Buckinghamshire is [[Old English language|Anglo-Saxon]] in origin and means ''The district (scire) of Bucca's home''. ''Bucca's home'' refers to [[Buckingham]] in the north of the county, and is named after an Anglo-Saxon landowner. The county has been so named since about the 12th century; however, the county has existed since it was a subdivision of the kingdom of [[Mercia]] (585\u2013919).\n\nThe history of the area predates the Anglo-Saxon period and the county has a rich history starting from the [[Celt]]ic and [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] periods, though the Anglo-Saxons perhaps had the greatest impact on Buckinghamshire: the geography of the rural county is largely as it was in the Anglo-Saxon period. Later, Buckinghamshire became an important political arena, with [[Henry VIII of England|King Henry VIII]] intervening in local politics in the 16th century and just a century later the [[English Civil War]] was reputedly started by [[John Hampden]] in mid-Bucks.<ref name=\"Biography of John Hampden\">{{cite web |url=http://www.johnhampden.org/ |title=Biography of John Hampden |publisher=Johnhampden.org |accessdate=19 September 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100908134006/http://www.johnhampden.org/ |archive-date=8 September 2010 |url-status=live |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\nHistorically, the biggest change to the county came in the 19th century, when a combination of [[cholera]] and [[famine]] hit the rural county, forcing many to migrate to larger towns to find work. Not only did this alter the local economic situation, it meant a lot of land was going cheap at a time when the rich were more mobile and leafy Bucks became a popular rural idyll: an image it still has today. Buckinghamshire is a popular home for London commuters, leading to greater local affluence; however, some pockets of relative deprivation remain.<ref name=\"WLAP\">{{cite web|title=High Wycombe Local Community Area Profile |publisher=[[Buckinghamshire County Council]] |date=October 2008 |url=http://www.buckscc.gov.uk/assets/content/bcc/docs/research/area_profiles/Wycombe2008.pdf |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120606165628/http://www.buckscc.gov.uk/assets/content/bcc/docs/research/area_profiles/Wycombe2008.pdf |archivedate=6 June 2012 |df=dmy }}</ref>\n\nThe expansion of London and coming of the railways promoted the growth of towns in the south of the county such as Aylesbury, Amersham and High Wycombe, leaving the town Buckingham itself to the north in a relative backwater.<ref name=\"About Buckingham UoB\">{{cite web|title=About Buckingham|url=http://www.buckingham.ac.uk/about/history/town|website=University of Buckingham|accessdate=15 December 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150910190131/http://www.buckingham.ac.uk/about/history/town|archive-date=10 September 2015|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}</ref> As a result, most county institutions are now based in the south of the county or Milton Keynes, rather than in Buckingham.\n\n==Geography==\nThe county can be split into two sections geographically. The south leads from the [[River Thames]] up the gentle slopes of the [[Chiltern Hills]] to the more abrupt slopes on the northern side leading to the [[Vale of Aylesbury]] and the Borough of Milton Keynes, a large and relatively level expanse of land that is  the southern [[drainage basin|catchment]] of the [[River Great Ouse]].\n\n===Waterways===\n\n====Rivers====\nThe county includes parts of two of the four longest rivers in England. The [[River Thames]] forms the southern boundary with [[Berkshire]], which has crept over the border at [[Eton, Berkshire|Eton]] and [[Slough]] so that the river is no longer the sole boundary between the two counties. The River Great Ouse rises just outside the county in [[Northamptonshire]] and flows east through Buckingham, Milton Keynes and [[Olney, Buckinghamshire|Olney]].\n\n====Canals====\n[[File:Medmenham River Thames geograph-4090549-by-Ben-Brooksbank.jpg|thumb|The River Thames at Medmenham]]\nThe main branch of the [[Grand Union Canal]] passes through the county as do its arms to [[Slough Arm|Slough]], [[Aylesbury Canal Society|Aylesbury]], [[Wendover Arm Canal|Wendover]] (disused) and [[Buckingham Arm|Buckingham]] (disused). The canal has been incorporated into the landscaping of Milton Keynes.\n\n===Landscape===\nThe southern part of the county is dominated by the Chiltern Hills. The two highest points in Buckinghamshire are [[Haddington Hill]] in Wendover Woods (a stone marks its summit) at {{convert|267|m|ft}} above sea level, and [[Coombe Hill, Buckinghamshire|Coombe Hill]] near [[Wendover]] at {{convert|260|m|ft}}.\n\n====Mineral extraction====\nQuarrying has taken place for chalk, clay for brickmaking and gravel and sand in the river valleys. Flint, also extracted from quarries, was often used to build older local buildings. Several former quarries, now flooded, have become nature reserves.<ref name=\"College Lake\">{{cite web|title=College Lake|url=http://www.bbowt.org.uk/college-lake/about-college-lake|publisher=BBOWT|accessdate=12 November 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151024012611/http://www.bbowt.org.uk/college-lake/about-college-lake|archive-date=24 October 2015|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\n==Demography==\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+ Buckinghamshire districts\n|'''District'''\n|'''Main towns'''\n|'''Population (2011)'''<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/publications/re-reference-tables.html?edition=tcm%3A77-286262|title= 2011 Census: KS101EW Usual resident population, local authorities in England and Wales|access-date= 11 December 2012|archive-url= http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20160105160709/http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/publications/re-reference-tables.html?edition=tcm%3A77-286262|archive-date= 5 January 2016|url-status= live|df= dmy-all}}</ref>\n\n|'''Area'''\n|'''Population density (2011)'''\n|'''Population projection 2026'''\n|-\n|'''[[Aylesbury Vale]]'''||[[Aylesbury]], [[Buckingham]]||174,137|| 902.75&nbsp;km\u00b2 || 193/km\u00b2 || 213,000\n|-\n|'''[[Wycombe (district)|Wycombe]]'''||[[High Wycombe]], [[Marlow, Buckinghamshire|Marlow]]||171,644|| 324.57&nbsp;km\u00b2\n||529/km\u00b2||165,000\n|-\n|'''[[Chiltern (district)|Chiltern]]'''||[[Amersham]], [[Chesham]]||92,635||196.35&nbsp;km\u00b2||472/km\u00b2||89,000\n|-\n|'''[[South Bucks]]'''||[[Beaconsfield]], [[Burnham, Buckinghamshire|Burnham]]||66,867||141.28&nbsp;km\u00b2||474/km\u00b2||63,800\n|-\n|'''TOTAL Non-Metropolitan'''||N/A||'''505,283'''||'''1565&nbsp;km\u00b2'''||'''323/km\u00b2'''||'''530,800'''\n|-\n|'''[[Borough of Milton Keynes]]'''||[[Milton Keynes]], [[Newport Pagnell]]||248,821||308.63&nbsp;km\u00b2||806/km\u00b2||323,146<ref>{{cite web |url= http://analysis.mkiobservatory.org.uk/webview/index.jsp?v=2&mode=cube&cube=http://analysis.mkiobservatory.org.uk:80/obj/fCube/PE097_C1&study=http://analysis.mkiobservatory.org.uk:80/obj/fStudy/PE097&context=http://analysis.mkiobservatory.org.uk:80/obj/cServer/MKi&top=yes |archive-url= https://archive.today/20120701155340/http://analysis.mkiobservatory.org.uk/webview/index.jsp?v=2&mode=cube&cube=http://analysis.mkiobservatory.org.uk:80/obj/fCube/PE097_C1&study=http://analysis.mkiobservatory.org.uk:80/obj/fStudy/PE097&context=http://analysis.mkiobservatory.org.uk:80/obj/cServer/MKi&top=yes |url-status= dead |archive-date= 2012-07-01 |title= Milton Keynes intelligence Observatory }}</ref>\n|-\n|'''TOTAL Ceremonial'''||N/A||'''754,104'''||'''1874&nbsp;km\u00b2'''||'''402/km\u00b2'''||'''853,946'''\n|}\n[[File:CheshamPondParkView.jpg|thumb|Suburban housing, Chesham]]\nAs can be seen from the table, the [[Vale of Aylesbury]] and the Borough of Milton Keynes have been identified as growth areas, with a projected population surge of almost 40,000 in Aylesbury Vale between 2011 and 2026 and 75,000 in Milton Keynes within the same 15 years.{{citation needed|date=November 2015}} The population of the Borough of Milton Keynes is expected to reach almost 350,000 by 2031.<ref name=\"guardian060104\">{{cite news |author=Hetherington, Peter |url=http://society.guardian.co.uk/urbandesign/story/0,11200,1116879,00.html?=rss |title=Milton Keynes to double in size over next 20 years |work=The Guardian |accessdate=23 November 2012 |location=London |date=6 January 2004 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060418100925/http://society.guardian.co.uk/urbandesign/story/0,11200,1116879,00.html?=rss |archive-date=18 April 2006 |url-status=live |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\nBuckinghamshire is sub-divided into civil parishes.\n\n<!--The info here can easily be sourced from Census data.

The ceremonial county has a [[Lord Lieutenant]] and a [[High Sheriff]]. Currently the [[Lord Lieutenant of Buckinghamshire]] is [[Sir Henry Aubrey-Fletcher, 8th Baronet|Sir Henry Aubrey-Fletcher]] and the [[High Sheriff of Buckinghamshire]] is Amanda Nicholson.{{citation needed|date=November 2015}} The office of ''[[Custos rotulorum]]'' has been combined with that of Lord Lieutenant since 1702.\n\n===Buckinghamshire County Council (1889-2020)===\n\nUntil 31 March 2020, the ceremonial county had two top-level administrations: Buckinghamshire County Council, which administered about four-fifths of the county and the Borough of Milton Keynes, a [[unitary authority]], which administers the remaining fifth. There were four district councils that are subsidiary to the county council: Aylesbury Vale, Chiltern, [[South Bucks]] and Wycombe districts.\n\nThe [[Buckinghamshire County Council|county council]] was founded in 1889 with its base in new municipal buildings in Walton Street, Aylesbury (which are still there). In Buckinghamshire, local administration was run on a two-tier system where public services are split between the county council and a series of district councils.\n\nIn 1966 the council moved into new premises: a 15-storey tower block in the centre of Aylesbury (pictured) designed by county architect [[Fred Pooley]]. It is now a Grade II [[listed building]].\n\nIn 1997 the northernmost<ref>The part of Buckinghamshire north of the [[Varsity Line]] together with [[Bow Brickhill]], [[Woburn Sands]] and parts of [[Bletchley and Fenny Stratford]].</ref> part of Buckinghamshire, then Milton Keynes District, was separated to form a unitary authority, the Borough of Milton Keynes; however for ceremonial and some other purposes Milton Keynes is still considered in law to be part of Buckinghamshire.<ref>{{Cite legislation UK \n  | type = act\n  | year = 1997\n  | chapter = 23\n  | act = Lieutenancies Act 1997\n}}</ref>\n\nBuckinghamshire County Council was a large employer in the county and provides a variety of services, including education (schools, adult education and youth services), social services, highways, libraries, County Archives and Record Office, the [[Buckinghamshire County Museum|County Museum]] and the [[Roald Dahl Children's Gallery]] in Aylesbury, consumer services and some aspects of waste disposal and planning.\n\n===Milton Keynes Council===\n[[Milton Keynes Council]] was formed by the Local Government Act 1972 as the Milton Keynes District Council, subordinate to Buckinghamshire County Council. The (district) council was first [[1973 United Kingdom local elections|elected in 1973]], a year before formally coming into its powers and prior to the creation of the [[Borough of Milton Keynes|District of Milton Keynes]] on 1 April 1974. The council gained [[Borough status in the United Kingdom|borough status]], entitling it to be known as Milton Keynes Borough Council and to annually appoint a (ceremonial) Mayor of Milton Keynes.<ref name=\"hans74\">{{cite web|url=http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/written_answers/1974/mar/28/district-councils-and-boroughs#S5CV0871P0_19740328_CWA_145|title=District Councils and Boroughs|date=28 March 1974|work=Hansard 1803\u20132005|publisher=[[Parliament of the United Kingdom]]|accessdate=16 January 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121225201114/http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/written_answers/1974/mar/28/district-councils-and-boroughs#S5CV0871P0_19740328_CWA_145|archive-date=25 December 2012|url-status=live}}</ref><ref name=guide>{{cite book|title=Local Government in England and wales. a Guide to the New System.|year=1974|publisher=[[HMSO]]|location=London|isbn=0117508470|pages=15\u2013109|chapter=Table III(a)}}</ref> On 1 April 1997, it became a self-governing [[unitary authority]].\n\n===Flag===\nThe traditional [[flag of Buckinghamshire]] comprises a chained swan on a bicolour of red and black. The flag was registered with the [[Flag Institute]] on 20 May 2011.\n\n===Coat of arms===\n[[File:Neolithic Barrow Whiteleaf Hill ed.jpg|thumb|Neolithic Barrow, [[Monks Risborough|Whiteleaf Hill]]]]\nThe [[coat of arms]] of Buckinghamshire County Council features a white [[swan]] in chains. This dates back to the Anglo-Saxon period, when swans were bred in Buckinghamshire for the king's pleasure. That the swan is in chains illustrates that [[Swan upping|the swan is bound to the monarch]], an ancient law that still applies to wild swans in the UK today. The arms were first borne at the [[Battle of Agincourt]] by the [[Humphrey Stafford, 1st Duke of Buckingham|Duke of Buckingham]].\n\nAbove the swan is a gold band, in the centre of which is [[Whiteleaf Cross]], representing the many ancient landmarks of the county. The shield is surmounted by a [[beech]] tree, representing the [[Chiltern Forest]] that once covered almost half the county. Either side of the shield are a [[Deer|buck]], for Buckingham, and a swan, the county symbol.\n\nThe motto of the shield is ''Vestigia Nulla Retrorsum''. This is [[Latin]] and means 'no stepping back' (or 'no steps backwards').<ref>{{cite book|last1=Pine|first1=L.G.|title=A dictionary of mottoes|date=1983|publisher=Routledge & Kegan Paul|location=London|isbn=0-7100-9339-X|page=[https://archive.org/details/dictionaryofmott00tion/page/249 249]|edition=1|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/dictionaryofmott00tion/page/249}}</ref>\n\n==Economy==\n[[File:Ashton House, Milton Keynes - geograph.org.uk - 1208078.jpg|thumb|Offices, Milton Keynes]]\n[[File:Princes Risborough, ercol workshop and showroom - geograph.org.uk - 749399.jpg|thumb|Ercol furniture factory, Princes Risborough]]\nBuckinghamshire has a modern service-based economy and is part of the [[Berkshire]], Buckinghamshire and [[Oxfordshire]] [[NUTS-2]] region, which was the seventh richest subregion in the [[European Union]] in 2002.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://europa.eu/rapid/pressReleasesAction.do?reference=STAT/05/13&format=HTML&aged=0&language=en&guiLanguage=en |title='&#39;Regional GDP per capita in the EU25 GDP per capita in 2002 ranged from 32% of the EU25 average in Lubelskie to 315% in Inner London'&#39; |work=Europa (web portal) |date=25 January 2005 |accessdate=19 September 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090206184743/http://europa.eu/rapid/pressReleasesAction.do?reference=STAT%2F05%2F13&format=HTML&aged=0&language=en&guiLanguage=en |archive-date=6 February 2009 |url-status=live |df=dmy-all }}</ref> As well as the highest GDP per capita outside Inner London, Buckinghamshire has the highest quality of life, the highest life expectancy and the best education results in the country.<ref>{{cite news | url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/buckinghamshire-is-best-county-802353.html | title=Buckinghamshire is best county | accessdate=15 January 2009 | work=The Independent | location=London | first=Nicky | last=Burridge | date=29 March 2008 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090820205831/http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/buckinghamshire-is-best-county-802353.html | archive-date=20 August 2009 | url-status=live | df=dmy-all }}</ref> The southern part of the county is a prosperous section of the [[London commuter belt]].

Development in this region is restricted by the [[Metropolitan Green Belt]]. Other large settlements include the county town of [[Aylesbury]], [[Marlow, Buckinghamshire|Marlow]] in the south near the [[River Thames|Thames]] and [[Princes Risborough]] in the west near Oxford. Some areas without direct rail links to London, such as around the old county town of [[Buckingham]] and near [[Olney, Buckinghamshire|Olney]] in the northeast, are much less populous. The largest town is [[Milton Keynes]] in the northeast, which with the surrounding area is administered as a [[Borough of Milton Keynes|unitary authority]] separately to the rest of Buckinghamshire. The remainder of the county is administered by [[Buckinghamshire County Council]] as a [[non-metropolitan county]], and four district councils. In national elections, Buckinghamshire is considered a reliable supporter of the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]].\n\nA large part of the [[Chiltern Hills]], an [[Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty]], runs through the south of the county and attracts many walkers and cyclists from London. In this area older buildings are often made from local flint and red brick. Many parts of the county are quite affluent and like many areas around London this has led to high housing costs: several reports have identified the market town of [[Beaconsfield]] as having among the highest property prices outside London.<ref name=\"Beaconsfield cost\">{{cite web|last1=Spence|first1=Graham|title=Beaconsfield is the most expensive market town in England|url=http://www.getbucks.co.uk/news/local-news/beaconsfield-most-expensive-market-town-8257800|website=Get Bucks|accessdate=15 December 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151222103912/http://www.getbucks.co.uk/news/local-news/beaconsfield-most-expensive-market-town-8257800|archive-date=22 December 2015|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=How expensive are the houses in your street?

To the north of the county lies rolling countryside in the [[Vale of Aylesbury]] and around the [[River Great Ouse|Great Ouse]]. The [[River Thames|Thames]] forms part of the county's southwestern boundary. Notable service amenities in the county are [[Pinewood Film Studios]], [[Dorney Lake|Dorney rowing lake]] and part of [[Silverstone Circuit|Silverstone race track]] on the Northamptonshire border. Many national companies have head-offices or major centres in Milton Keynes. Heavy industry and quarrying is limited, with agriculture predominating after service industries.\n\n==History==\n{{Main|History of Buckinghamshire}}\n[[File:Buckingham-215x334.jpg|thumb|left|Map of Bucks (1904)]]\n\nThe name Buckinghamshire is [[Old English language|Anglo-Saxon]] in origin and means ''The district (scire) of Bucca's home''. ''Bucca's home'' refers to [[Buckingham]] in the north of the county, and is named after an Anglo-Saxon landowner. The county has been so named since about the 12th century; however, the county has existed since it was a subdivision of the kingdom of [[Mercia]] (585\u2013919).\n\nThe history of the area predates the Anglo-Saxon period and the county has a rich history starting from the [[Celt]]ic and [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] periods, though the Anglo-Saxons perhaps had the greatest impact on Buckinghamshire: the geography of the rural county is largely as it was in the Anglo-Saxon period. Later, Buckinghamshire became an important political arena, with [[Henry VIII of England|King Henry VIII]] intervening in local politics in the 16th century and just a century later the [[English Civil War]] was reputedly started by [[John Hampden]] in mid-Bucks.<ref name=\"Biography of John Hampden\">{{cite web |url=http://www.johnhampden.org/ |title=Biography of John Hampden |publisher=Johnhampden.org |accessdate=19 September 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100908134006/http://www.johnhampden.org/ |archive-date=8 September 2010 |url-status=live |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\nHistorically, the biggest change to the county came in the 19th century, when a combination of [[cholera]] and [[famine]] hit the rural county, forcing many to migrate to larger towns to find work. Not only did this alter the local economic situation, it meant a lot of land was going cheap at a time when the rich were more mobile and leafy Bucks became a popular rural idyll: an image it still has today. Buckinghamshire is a popular home for London commuters, leading to greater local affluence; however, some pockets of relative deprivation remain.<ref name=\"WLAP\">{{cite web|title=High Wycombe Local Community Area Profile |publisher=[[Buckinghamshire County Council]] |date=October 2008 |url=http://www.buckscc.gov.uk/assets/content/bcc/docs/research/area_profiles/Wycombe2008.pdf |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120606165628/http://www.buckscc.gov.uk/assets/content/bcc/docs/research/area_profiles/Wycombe2008.pdf |archivedate=6 June 2012 |df=dmy }}</ref>\n\nThe expansion of London and coming of the railways promoted the growth of towns in the south of the county such as Aylesbury, Amersham and High Wycombe, leaving the town Buckingham itself to the north in a relative backwater.<ref name=\"About Buckingham UoB\">{{cite web|title=About Buckingham|url=http://www.buckingham.ac.uk/about/history/town|website=University of Buckingham|accessdate=15 December 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150910190131/http://www.buckingham.ac.uk/about/history/town|archive-date=10 September 2015|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}</ref> As a result, most county institutions are now based in the south of the county or Milton Keynes, rather than in Buckingham.\n\n==Geography==\nThe county can be split into two sections geographically. The south leads from the [[River Thames]] up the gentle slopes of the [[Chiltern Hills]] to the more abrupt slopes on the northern side leading to the [[Vale of Aylesbury]] and the Borough of Milton Keynes, a large and relatively level expanse of land that is  the southern [[drainage basin|catchment]] of the [[River Great Ouse]].\n\n===Waterways===\n\n====Rivers====\nThe county includes parts of two of the four longest rivers in England. The [[River Thames]] forms the southern boundary with [[Berkshire]], which has crept over the border at [[Eton, Berkshire|Eton]] and [[Slough]] so that the river is no longer the sole boundary between the two counties. The River Great Ouse rises just outside the county in [[Northamptonshire]] and flows east through Buckingham, Milton Keynes and [[Olney, Buckinghamshire|Olney]].\n\n====Canals====\n[[File:Medmenham River Thames geograph-4090549-by-Ben-Brooksbank.jpg|thumb|The River Thames at Medmenham]]\nThe main branch of the [[Grand Union Canal]] passes through the county as do its arms to [[Slough Arm|Slough]], [[Aylesbury Canal Society|Aylesbury]], [[Wendover Arm Canal|Wendover]] (disused) and [[Buckingham Arm|Buckingham]] (disused). The canal has been incorporated into the landscaping of Milton Keynes.\n\n===Landscape===\nThe southern part of the county is dominated by the Chiltern Hills. The two highest points in Buckinghamshire are [[Haddington Hill]] in Wendover Woods (a stone marks its summit) at {{convert|267|m|ft}} above sea level, and [[Coombe Hill, Buckinghamshire|Coombe Hill]] near [[Wendover]] at {{convert|260|m|ft}}.\n\n====Mineral extraction====\nQuarrying has taken place for chalk, clay for brickmaking and gravel and sand in the river valleys. Flint, also extracted from quarries, was often used to build older local buildings. Several former quarries, now flooded, have become nature reserves.<ref name=\"College Lake\">{{cite web|title=College Lake|url=http://www.bbowt.org.uk/college-lake/about-college-lake|publisher=BBOWT|accessdate=12 November 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151024012611/http://www.bbowt.org.uk/college-lake/about-college-lake|archive-date=24 October 2015|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\n==Demography==\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+ Buckinghamshire districts\n|'''District'''\n|'''Main towns'''\n|'''Population (2011)'''<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/publications/re-reference-tables.html?edition=tcm%3A77-286262|title= 2011 Census: KS101EW Usual resident population, local authorities in England and Wales|access-date= 11 December 2012|archive-url= http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20160105160709/http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/publications/re-reference-tables.html?edition=tcm%3A77-286262|archive-date= 5 January 2016|url-status= live|df= dmy-all}}</ref>\n\n|'''Area'''\n|'''Population density (2011)'''\n|'''Population projection 2026'''\n|-\n|'''[[Aylesbury Vale]]'''||[[Aylesbury]], [[Buckingham]]||174,137|| 902.75&nbsp;km\u00b2 || 193/km\u00b2 || 213,000\n|-\n|'''[[Wycombe (district)|Wycombe]]'''||[[High Wycombe]], [[Marlow, Buckinghamshire|Marlow]]||171,644|| 324.57&nbsp;km\u00b2\n||529/km\u00b2||165,000\n|-\n|'''[[Chiltern (district)|Chiltern]]'''||[[Amersham]], [[Chesham]]||92,635||196.35&nbsp;km\u00b2||472/km\u00b2||89,000\n|-\n|'''[[South Bucks]]'''||[[Beaconsfield]], [[Burnham, Buckinghamshire|Burnham]]||66,867||141.28&nbsp;km\u00b2||474/km\u00b2||63,800\n|-\n|'''TOTAL Non-Metropolitan'''||N/A||'''505,283'''||'''1565&nbsp;km\u00b2'''||'''323/km\u00b2'''||'''530,800'''\n|-\n|'''[[Borough of Milton Keynes]]'''||[[Milton Keynes]], [[Newport Pagnell]]||248,821||308.63&nbsp;km\u00b2||806/km\u00b2||323,146<ref>{{cite web |url= http://analysis.mkiobservatory.org.uk/webview/index.jsp?v=2&mode=cube&cube=http://analysis.mkiobservatory.org.uk:80/obj/fCube/PE097_C1&study=http://analysis.mkiobservatory.org.uk:80/obj/fStudy/PE097&context=http://analysis.mkiobservatory.org.uk:80/obj/cServer/MKi&top=yes |archive-url= https://archive.today/20120701155340/http://analysis.mkiobservatory.org.uk/webview/index.jsp?v=2&mode=cube&cube=http://analysis.mkiobservatory.org.uk:80/obj/fCube/PE097_C1&study=http://analysis.mkiobservatory.org.uk:80/obj/fStudy/PE097&context=http://analysis.mkiobservatory.org.uk:80/obj/cServer/MKi&top=yes |url-status= dead |archive-date= 2012-07-01 |title= Milton Keynes intelligence Observatory }}</ref>\n|-\n|'''TOTAL Ceremonial'''||N/A||'''754,104'''||'''1874&nbsp;km\u00b2'''||'''402/km\u00b2'''||'''853,946'''\n|}\n[[File:CheshamPondParkView.jpg|thumb|Suburban housing, Chesham]]\nAs can be seen from the table, the [[Vale of Aylesbury]] and the Borough of Milton Keynes have been identified as growth areas, with a projected population surge of almost 40,000 in Aylesbury Vale between 2011 and 2026 and 75,000 in Milton Keynes within the same 15 years.{{citation needed|date=November 2015}} The population of the Borough of Milton Keynes is expected to reach almost 350,000 by 2031.<ref name=\"guardian060104\">{{cite news |author=Hetherington, Peter |url=http://society.guardian.co.uk/urbandesign/story/0,11200,1116879,00.html?=rss |title=Milton Keynes to double in size over next 20 years |work=The Guardian |accessdate=23 November 2012 |location=London |date=6 January 2004 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060418100925/http://society.guardian.co.uk/urbandesign/story/0,11200,1116879,00.html?=rss |archive-date=18 April 2006 |url-status=live |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\nBuckinghamshire is sub-divided into civil parishes.\n\n<!--The info here can easily be sourced from Census data.

There were four district councils that are subsidiary to the county council: Aylesbury Vale, Chiltern, [[South Bucks]] and Wycombe districts.\n\nThe [[Buckinghamshire County Council|county council]] was founded in 1889 with its base in new municipal buildings in Walton Street, Aylesbury (which are still there). In Buckinghamshire, local administration was run on a two-tier system where public services are split between the county council and a series of district councils.\n\nIn 1966 the council moved into new premises: a 15-storey tower block in the centre of Aylesbury (pictured) designed by county architect [[Fred Pooley]]. It is now a Grade II [[listed building]].\n\nIn 1997 the northernmost<ref>The part of Buckinghamshire north of the [[Varsity Line]] together with [[Bow Brickhill]], [[Woburn Sands]] and parts of [[Bletchley and Fenny Stratford]].</ref> part of Buckinghamshire, then Milton Keynes District, was separated to form a unitary authority, the Borough of Milton Keynes; however for ceremonial and some other purposes Milton Keynes is still considered in law to be part of Buckinghamshire.<ref>{{Cite legislation UK \n  | type = act\n  | year = 1997\n  | chapter = 23\n  | act = Lieutenancies Act 1997\n}}</ref>\n\nBuckinghamshire County Council was a large employer in the county and provides a variety of services, including education (schools, adult education and youth services), social services, highways, libraries, County Archives and Record Office, the [[Buckinghamshire County Museum|County Museum]] and the [[Roald Dahl Children's Gallery]] in Aylesbury, consumer services and some aspects of waste disposal and planning.\n\n===Milton Keynes Council===\n[[Milton Keynes Council]] was formed by the Local Government Act 1972 as the Milton Keynes District Council, subordinate to Buckinghamshire County Council. The (district) council was first [[1973 United Kingdom local elections|elected in 1973]], a year before formally coming into its powers and prior to the creation of the [[Borough of Milton Keynes|District of Milton Keynes]] on 1 April 1974.

The arms were first borne at the [[Battle of Agincourt]] by the [[Humphrey Stafford, 1st Duke of Buckingham|Duke of Buckingham]].\n\nAbove the swan is a gold band, in the centre of which is [[Whiteleaf Cross]], representing the many ancient landmarks of the county. The shield is surmounted by a [[beech]] tree, representing the [[Chiltern Forest]] that once covered almost half the county. Either side of the shield are a [[Deer|buck]], for Buckingham, and a swan, the county symbol.\n\nThe motto of the shield is ''Vestigia Nulla Retrorsum''. This is [[Latin]] and means 'no stepping back' (or 'no steps backwards').<ref>{{cite book|last1=Pine|first1=L.G.|title=A dictionary of mottoes|date=1983|publisher=Routledge & Kegan Paul|location=London|isbn=0-7100-9339-X|page=[https://archive.org/details/dictionaryofmott00tion/page/249 249]|edition=1|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/dictionaryofmott00tion/page/249}}</ref>\n\n==Economy==\n[[File:Ashton House, Milton Keynes - geograph.org.uk - 1208078.jpg|thumb|Offices, Milton Keynes]]\n[[File:Princes Risborough, ercol workshop and showroom - geograph.org.uk - 749399.jpg|thumb|Ercol furniture factory, Princes Risborough]]\nBuckinghamshire has a modern service-based economy and is part of the [[Berkshire]], Buckinghamshire and [[Oxfordshire]] [[NUTS-2]] region, which was the seventh richest subregion in the [[European Union]] in 2002.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://europa.eu/rapid/pressReleasesAction.do?reference=STAT/05/13&format=HTML&aged=0&language=en&guiLanguage=en |title='&#39;Regional GDP per capita in the EU25 GDP per capita in 2002 ranged from 32% of the EU25 average in Lubelskie to 315% in Inner London'&#39; |work=Europa (web portal) |date=25 January 2005 |accessdate=19 September 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090206184743/http://europa.eu/rapid/pressReleasesAction.do?reference=STAT%2F05%2F13&format=HTML&aged=0&language=en&guiLanguage=en |archive-date=6 February 2009 |url-status=live |df=dmy-all }}</ref> As well as the highest GDP per capita outside Inner London, Buckinghamshire has the highest quality of life, the highest life expectancy and the best education results in the country.<ref>{{cite news | url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/buckinghamshire-is-best-county-802353.html | title=Buckinghamshire is best county | accessdate=15 January 2009 | work=The Independent | location=London | first=Nicky | last=Burridge | date=29 March 2008 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090820205831/http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/buckinghamshire-is-best-county-802353.html | archive-date=20 August 2009 | url-status=live | df=dmy-all }}</ref> The southern part of the county is a prosperous section of the [[London commuter belt]].

Moreover, business interests funded their lobbyists better.  For example, in 1946 and 1947, the [[National Association of Manufacturers]] (NAM) had a budget of $3.6 million (including $1.9 million for advertising), while the CIO publicity department had $200 thousand, while the CIO's research and education department had another $200 thousand and AFL counterparts had even smaller budgets.  Thus, the CIO and AFL had combined budgets of under half a million dollars annually, while their largest counterpart NAM had an annual budget seven times larger \u2013 amidst major lobbying efforts that included the landmark 1947 [[Labor Management Relations Act of 1947|Taft-Hartley Act]].  De Caux himself, for his part, was hand-tied by suspicion of his communist ties.<ref name=Burstein />\n\nNevertheless, the CIO's second president [[Philip Murray]] had De Caux work with the CIO's legislation and research departments on key messaging to \"[[John Q. Public]].\" The CIO used monies raised largely through the [[CIO Political Action Committee]] ([[CIO-PAC]]), itself an object of concern to politicians and business interests.  Efforts by De Caux included:  leaflets (e.g., \"Your Union is in Danger!\"), pamphlets (e.g., \"Defend Your Union\"), analyses of Congressional agenda, observance of the CIO-PAC's Defend Labor Month, and calls to union members for political action.<ref name=Burstein />\n\nIn response:  <blockquote>De Caux developed a thorough plan for publicizing labor's objections to the Taft and Hartley bills to the general public. In it, De Caux detailed plans for all of the activities expected of the grassroots, member-focused programming that the CIO Executive Board had endorsed: the continued printing of CIO pamphlets and advertisement mats for placement (and payment) by international and local unions, special editions of the ''CIO News'', and the use of existing CIO-sponsored radio programs to publicize Defend Labor Month activities.<ref name=Burstein /></blockquote>  De Caux's public relations campaign comprised:  pre-recorded and live radio address by CIO president Murray, radio spots, placement of CIO officials on existing radio programs, paid newspaper advertisements, anti-Taft-Hartley press kits, and campaigns that targeted different American groups (African-American, non-English speakers, farmers, etc.).<ref name=Burstein />\n\nIn late 1947, second president [[Philip Murray]] asked De Caux to resign as the CIO began to rid itself of perceived [[Communism|communists]] and [[fellow travelers]] in its ranks (e.g., [[Lee Pressman]] in February 1948).<ref name=Papers />\n\n===Wallace support 1948===\n\n[[File:Henry-A.-Wallace-Townsend.jpeg|thumb|right|[[Henry A.

Abrams was born in [[Bessarabia]], then in Russia. Arriving as a child in the States, she worked through her teens and joined the [[Amalgamated Clothing Workers]] in [[Milwaukee, Wisconsin]], and the [[Young Peoples Socialist League]]. She supported [[Socialist Party of America|Socialist]] candidates and was against [[American entry into World War I]].\n\nAbrams and De Caux met at Brookwood, by which time she was already experienced as a labor activist.  In the 1930s and 1940s, she served as a labor research director but resigned in the early 1940s due to a split between former CIO president Lewis and new president Murray.

To ensure that servicemen supported organized labor upon their return home, De Caux began producing special editions of the CIO member newspaper, the CIO News, and shipping them to military personnel abroad, free of charge, during the war. By 1946, Fortune Magazine reported that veterans had a more favorable attitude toward organized labor than the general population.<ref name=Burstein /></blockquote>\n\nIn May 1977, De Caux gave his papers to the Archives of Labor History and Urban Affairs at [[Wayne State University]].

Moreover, business interests funded their lobbyists better.  For example, in 1946 and 1947, the [[National Association of Manufacturers]] (NAM) had a budget of $3.6 million (including $1.9 million for advertising), while the CIO publicity department had $200 thousand, while the CIO's research and education department had another $200 thousand and AFL counterparts had even smaller budgets.  Thus, the CIO and AFL had combined budgets of under half a million dollars annually, while their largest counterpart NAM had an annual budget seven times larger \u2013 amidst major lobbying efforts that included the landmark 1947 [[Labor Management Relations Act of 1947|Taft-Hartley Act]].  De Caux himself, for his part, was hand-tied by suspicion of his communist ties.<ref name=Burstein />\n\nNevertheless, the CIO's second president [[Philip Murray]] had De Caux work with the CIO's legislation and research departments on key messaging to \"[[John Q. Public]].\" The CIO used monies raised largely through the [[CIO Political Action Committee]] ([[CIO-PAC]]), itself an object of concern to politicians and business interests.  Efforts by De Caux included:  leaflets (e.g., \"Your Union is in Danger!\"), pamphlets (e.g., \"Defend Your Union\"), analyses of Congressional agenda, observance of the CIO-PAC's Defend Labor Month, and calls to union members for political action.<ref name=Burstein />\n\nIn response:  <blockquote>De Caux developed a thorough plan for publicizing labor's objections to the Taft and Hartley bills to the general public. In it, De Caux detailed plans for all of the activities expected of the grassroots, member-focused programming that the CIO Executive Board had endorsed: the continued printing of CIO pamphlets and advertisement mats for placement (and payment) by international and local unions, special editions of the ''CIO News'', and the use of existing CIO-sponsored radio programs to publicize Defend Labor Month activities.<ref name=Burstein /></blockquote>  De Caux's public relations campaign comprised:  pre-recorded and live radio address by CIO president Murray, radio spots, placement of CIO officials on existing radio programs, paid newspaper advertisements, anti-Taft-Hartley press kits, and campaigns that targeted different American groups (African-American, non-English speakers, farmers, etc.).<ref name=Burstein />\n\nIn late 1947, second president [[Philip Murray]] asked De Caux to resign as the CIO began to rid itself of perceived [[Communism|communists]] and [[fellow travelers]] in its ranks (e.g., [[Lee Pressman]] in February 1948).<ref name=Papers />\n\n===Wallace support 1948===\n\n[[File:Henry-A.-Wallace-Townsend.jpeg|thumb|right|[[Henry A.

In the 1930s and 1940s, she served as a labor research director but resigned in the early 1940s due to a split between former CIO president Lewis and new president Murray.

(branded as '''illy''') is an Italian coffee roasting company that specializes in the production of [[espresso]]. The company was founded by [[Francesco Illy]] in 1933, and it was later led and expanded by his son, [[Ernesto Illy]]. Today, [[Andrea Illy]] is the Chairman, representing the third generation of family leadership, and Massimiliano Pogliani is the CEO. As of 31 December 2015, the company had 1,177 employees, 8.6% more than 2014. The company's coffee is present in 140 countries, and at the end of 2016, its revenues totaled \u20ac460 million, a 5% increase over 2015.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://valuereport.illy.com/pdf/BILANCIO_illy_IDENTITA_EN.pdf|title=Illy Annual Report|accessdate=14 March 2018}}</ref>\n\nThe company produces one blend in three roast variations, those being normal, dark roast, and decaffeinated. In addition, illy offers Monoarabica, single-origin [[Coffea arabica|arabica]] beans from six countries: Brazil, Guatemala, Ethiopia, Colombia, Costa Rica, and India. Seasonally, the company offers Idillyum, a low-caffeine arabica that is grown in the rich, volcanic soils of El Salvador. The illy brand of coffee is packaged as whole beans, pre-ground coffee, [[Easy Serving Espresso Pod|Easy Serving Espresso]] (E.S.E.) pods, and [[iperEspresso]] capsules.\n\n==History==\n[[File:Illy Ferenc.jpg|thumb|[[Francesco Illy]] (Illy Ferenc), the company's founder, in 1930]]\n\nThe history of illycaff\u00e8 is inextricably linked to the lives of the company's founder, [[Francesco Illy]] (known as Illy Ferenc in Hungarian), and his family. Born in [[Temesv\u00e1r]] in the Empire of [[Austria-Hungary]] (since 1918 [[Timi\u0219oara]], [[Romania]]), Francesco Illy later went to [[Trieste]], Italy, during World War I as an officer in the army. After the war, he remained in the city, which had recently come under Italian rule, and in 1933 set up a business in the [[cocoa bean|cocoa]] and [[coffee]] sectors, eventually deciding to concentrate exclusively on coffee.<ref name=\"Fortune\">{{citation|author=Nicholas Stein|author2=Doris Burke|title=Crisis in a coffee cup|url=http://archive.fortune.com/magazines/fortune/fortune_archive/2002/12/09/333463/index.htm|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150112212629/http://archive.fortune.com/magazines/fortune/fortune_archive/2002/12/09/333463/index.htm|archivedate=12 January 2015|magazine=[[Fortune (magazine)|Fortune]]|date=9 December 2002}}.</ref> From the beginning, Francesco was interested in [[espresso]] coffee.

Illy coffee was soon \"exported\" outside the immediate Trieste area, and it was eventually sold all over Italy.\n\nAfter World War II, control of the company passed to [[Ernesto Illy]] (1925\u20132008), the son of the founder, who started a research laboratory that soon became the source of numerous new inventions and patents. It was Ernesto, a scientist and researcher, who established cooperation agreements with universities and research centres, and he promoted premium coffee around the globe.<ref>{{citation|author=Dennis Hevesi|title=Ernesto Illy, chairman of coffee company, is dead at 82|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/02/06/world/europe/06illy.html|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120224002836/http://www.nytimes.com/2008/02/06/world/europe/06illy.html|archivedate=24 February 2012|newspaper=The New York Times|date=6 February 2008}}.</ref>\n\nErnesto's son [[Andrea Illy]] is currently the Chairman of the company, while Andrea's sister Anna Illy and brothers Francesco Illy and [[Riccardo Illy]] are on the board of directors.<ref name=\"Fortune\"/> The illy brand of coffee is available in many countries, though with significant price differences depending on [[tariff|import duty]] rates.\n\nIllycaff\u00e8 S.p.A. established the University of Coffee in Naples in 1999<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.gamberorosso.it/notizie/articoli-food/l-universita-del-caffe-di-illy-storia-ed-evoluzione-della-scuola-di-formazione-di-trieste/|website=www.gamberorosso.it|access-date=2019-09-23}}</ref>.

The illy group is made up of several companies located in North America, France, Germany, Spain and [[Benelux]]. The group employs approximately 800 people throughout these six locations.\n\nSince the end of the 1980s, illy has not purchased green coffee from the international commodity markets, but directly from the source. The company exclusively purchases coffee of the [[Coffea arabica|arabica]] species, in particular from Brazil, the largest producer worldwide, but also from Colombia, India, and countries in Africa and Central America. Illy's ''Universit\u00e0 del caff\u00e8'' (\"University of Coffee\") offers free training for growers. In Brazil, a nine-month program (one week per month) includes 360 hours of lectures. Illy buys between 10% and 30% of coffee produced by growers trained at the University of Coffee at a premium price, but does not require that the growers enter into an exclusive contract with the company.<ref>{{citation|author=Ariel Schwartz|title=Why illycaffe doesn't sell fair trade coffee|url=http://www.fastcompany.com/1706189/why-andrea-illy-doesnt-sell-fair-trade-coffee|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120707101546/http://www.fastcompany.com/1706189/why-andrea-illy-doesnt-sell-fair-trade-coffee|archivedate=7 July 2012|work=[[Fast Company (magazine)|Fast Company]]|date=30 November 2010}}.</ref>\n\nIlly is the world's first company to receive the Responsible Supply Chain Process (RSCP) certification of sustainability awarded by the [[Det Norske Veritas]] (DNV).<ref>{{citation|title=The Story behind a Cup of Coffee &#91;Forum No. 2 2011&#93;|url=http://www.dnv.com/resources/publications/dnv_forum/2011/forum_2_2011/thestorybehindacupofcoffee.asp|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130929043843/http://www.dnv.com/resources/publications/dnv_forum/2011/forum_2_2011/thestorybehindacupofcoffee.asp|archivedate=29 September 2013|publisher=[[Det Norske Veritas]]|date=22 May 2011}}; {{citation|title=Illy is the world's first coffee with DNV sustainability certification|url=http://www.espressocasa.co.nz/site/sustainability.php|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130929044824/http://www.espressocasa.co.nz/site/sustainability.php|archivedate=29 September 2013|publisher=Espressocasa.co.nz|accessdate=29 September 2013}}.</ref>\n\nFrom 2004 to 2012, illycaff\u00e8 funded the Ernesto Illy Trieste Science Prize to give recognition to science researchers from the developing world, in collaboration with The World Academy of Sciences ([[TWAS]]).<ref>{{citation|title=The Ernesto Illy Trieste Science Prize (2005\u20132008, 2009\u20132012)|url=http://twas.ictp.it/prog/prizes/trieste-science-prize|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131204003127/http://twas.ictp.it/prog/prizes/trieste-science-prize|archivedate=4 December 2013|publisher=The World Academy of Sciences ([[TWAS]])|accessdate=4 December 2013}}.</ref> Illy was featured in the 2006 documentary ''[[Black Gold (2006 film)|Black Gold]]'', in reference to its marketing of coffee from [[Ethiopia]].\n\n==Coffee==\n[[File:Tazzina di caff\u00e8 a Ventimiglia.jpg|thumb|A small cup of illy coffee in [[Ventimiglia]], [[Liguria]], Italy]]\n\nIlly coffees are blended from arabica beans from multiple sources.

(branded as '''illy''') is an Italian coffee roasting company that specializes in the production of [[espresso]]. The company was founded by [[Francesco Illy]] in 1933, and it was later led and expanded by his son, [[Ernesto Illy]]. Today, [[Andrea Illy]] is the Chairman, representing the third generation of family leadership, and Massimiliano Pogliani is the CEO. As of 31 December 2015, the company had 1,177 employees, 8.6% more than 2014. The company's coffee is present in 140 countries, and at the end of 2016, its revenues totaled \u20ac460 million, a 5% increase over 2015.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://valuereport.illy.com/pdf/BILANCIO_illy_IDENTITA_EN.pdf|title=Illy Annual Report|accessdate=14 March 2018}}</ref>\n\nThe company produces one blend in three roast variations, those being normal, dark roast, and decaffeinated. In addition, illy offers Monoarabica, single-origin [[Coffea arabica|arabica]] beans from six countries: Brazil, Guatemala, Ethiopia, Colombia, Costa Rica, and India. Seasonally, the company offers Idillyum, a low-caffeine arabica that is grown in the rich, volcanic soils of El Salvador. The illy brand of coffee is packaged as whole beans, pre-ground coffee, [[Easy Serving Espresso Pod|Easy Serving Espresso]] (E.S.E.) pods, and [[iperEspresso]] capsules.\n\n==History==\n[[File:Illy Ferenc.jpg|thumb|[[Francesco Illy]] (Illy Ferenc), the company's founder, in 1930]]\n\nThe history of illycaff\u00e8 is inextricably linked to the lives of the company's founder, [[Francesco Illy]] (known as Illy Ferenc in Hungarian), and his family. Born in [[Temesv\u00e1r]] in the Empire of [[Austria-Hungary]] (since 1918 [[Timi\u015foara]], [[Romania]]), Francesco Illy later went to [[Trieste]], Italy, during World War I as an officer in the army. After the war, he remained in the city, which had recently come under Italian rule, and in 1933 set up a business in the [[cocoa bean|cocoa]] and [[coffee]] sectors, eventually deciding to concentrate exclusively on coffee.<ref name=\"Fortune\">{{citation|author=Nicholas Stein|author2=Doris Burke|title=Crisis in a coffee cup|url=http://archive.fortune.com/magazines/fortune/fortune_archive/2002/12/09/333463/index.htm|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150112212629/http://archive.fortune.com/magazines/fortune/fortune_archive/2002/12/09/333463/index.htm|archivedate=12 January 2015|magazine=[[Fortune (magazine)|Fortune]]|date=9 December 2002}}.</ref> From the beginning, Francesco was interested in [[espresso]] coffee.

Illy coffee was soon \"exported\" outside the immediate Trieste area, and it was eventually sold all over Italy.\n\nAfter World War II, control of the company passed to [[Ernesto Illy]] (1925\u20132008), the son of the founder, who started a research laboratory that soon became the source of numerous new inventions and patents. It was Ernesto, a scientist and researcher, who established cooperation agreements with universities and research centres, and he promoted premium coffee around the globe.<ref>{{citation|author=Dennis Hevesi|title=Ernesto Illy, chairman of coffee company, is dead at 82|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/02/06/world/europe/06illy.html|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120224002836/http://www.nytimes.com/2008/02/06/world/europe/06illy.html|archivedate=24 February 2012|newspaper=The New York Times|date=6 February 2008}}.</ref>\n\nErnesto's son [[Andrea Illy]] is currently the Chairman of the company, while Andrea's sister Anna Illy and brothers Francesco Illy and [[Riccardo Illy]] are on the board of directors.<ref name=\"Fortune\"/> The illy brand of coffee is available in many countries, though with significant price differences depending on [[tariff|import duty]] rates.\n\nIllycaff\u00e8 S.p.A. established the University of Coffee in Naples in 1999<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.gamberorosso.it/notizie/articoli-food/l-universita-del-caffe-di-illy-storia-ed-evoluzione-della-scuola-di-formazione-di-trieste/|website=www.gamberorosso.it|access-date=2019-09-23}}</ref>.

It was added to the [[New South Wales State Heritage Register]] on 15 April 2016.<ref name=nswshr-1947>{{cite NSW SHR|5061114|12 Pounder Rifled Breech-Loading Gun (Armstrong) (moveable heritage item)|hr=01947|fn=EF14/27003|accessdate=18 February 2020}}</ref>\n\n== History ==\nUpon its design in 1854 and its introduction into active military service, the {{convert|12|lb|kg|adj=on}} rifled breech-loading gun was an unparalleled technological advancement for the international artillery industry. Designed by Sir William Armstrong, often regarded as the inventor of modern artillery, the new rifled field gun was loaded from the rear which allowed it to fire a greater number of times, and at a greater range with improved accuracy, than the earlier guns loaded through the muzzle at the front. This new technology also introduced a new shape for the projectile - rather than the traditional round ball shape, it was now conical (much like today's bullets). Forged of [[wrought iron]], the breech-loading gun had a rifled barrel with a tapered end that improved the aim of the projectile as it left the barrel and, for the first time in modern artillery, the gun was installed on a two-wheel box carriage which allowed the weapon to be more easily manoeuvred and its barrel elevated.<ref name=nswshr-1947/>\n\nAlthough a practicing engineer, Sir William Armstrong turned his skills to artillery in the late 1840s and was soon designing and producing weapons. His most notable achievement (as described above) was the design of the Armstrong breech-loading gun (produced in several calibre ranges including six, nine, 12, 20, 40 and 110 pound models) in gun design for centuries, Armstrong was knighted for his services to the British state in 1859.<ref name=nswshr-1947/>\n\nFollowing the outbreak of the [[Crimean War]] in 1853, there was some anxiety and sense of paranoia amongst the Australian colonists about safety from invasion. In response, those colonists with means soon developed self-reliant volunteer defence units to protect themselves and their property. Although often self-funded, these units were furnished with arms and ammunition from their respective colonial governments and, in the early 1860s when the Australian colonies started taking delivery of a number of Armstrong's revolutionary rifled breech-loading guns, eight examples of the 12-pound type were acquired. Six guns were received by the Victorian Volunteer Field Artillery in 1864 and, of these, three were transferred to the Rupertswood Half Battery in 1889. Forming part of the Battery of the Victorian Horses Artillery with the Werribee Half Battery, the Rupertswood Half Battery was a mounted military unit funded privately and entirely by Sir [[William Clarke (Australian politician)|William Clarke]], a wealthy landowner and philanthropist. Disbanded upon Clarke's death in 1897, his patriotic efforts in supporting the colonial military through the Rupertswood Half Battery were recognised by the Victorian government's Defence Department and two guns were presented to his widow, Janet Lady Clarke.<ref name=nswshr-1947/>\n\nUpon the marriage of their daughter Lily Vera Montague Clarke to Major George Landale in 1910, one of the guns (donated by the [[Government of Victoria|Victorian government]]) was gifted by Lady Clarke to the newly-weds who transported it to \"Dunwilly Station\", near Deniliquin. Here the weapon stood (the first and only of its type in NSW) at the entrance to the station for many decades.<ref name=nswshr-1947/>\n\nIn the 1980s, the significance of the 12-pounder rifled breech-loading gun at the station's entrance was finally realised and it underwent conservation works by the Army Apprentices School in 1988/89. Today the gun is in its complete and functioning form and it is displayed, alongside its box carriage and projectiles, in a custom-made, climate controlled structure at the Returned and Services League Club at Deniliquin.<ref name=nswshr-1947/>\n\nAustralia retains a small number of the rifled breech-loading gun (of varying calibres). One 12-pounder guns is retained at the [[Australian War Memorial]], one at {{VICcity|Werribee}} and an incomplete one is being restored and will be then placed in  [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]].

Since its arrival in NSW, the gun at Deniliquin has not been associated with any particularly significant people and groups.<ref name=nswshr-1947/>\n\n'''The place is important in demonstrating aesthetic characteristics and/or a high degree of creative or technical achievement in New South Wales.'''\n\nAs the only example of its type in NSW, the 12-pounder rifled breech-loading gun at Deniliquin is of state heritage significance for its exceptional display of technical values. The only intact and functioning example of its type in NSW, this gun was designed by British engineer-turned-artillery manufacturer Sir William Armstrong in 1854 and, upon its production, was regarded as an unparalleled technological advancement for the international artillery industry. Described as one of the greatest steps forward in gun design for centuries, Armstrong was knighted for his services to the British state in 1859.<ref name=nswshr-1947/>\n\nThe rifled breech-loading gun (produced in various calibre ranges including six, nine, 12, 20, 40 and 110 pound models) was an innovative design that revolutionised artillery use across the world. For the first time in history, guns were loaded from the rear which allowed it to fire more rapidly, and at a greater range with improved accuracy, than the earlier guns loaded through the muzzle at the front. This new technology also introduced a new shape for the projectile-rather than the traditional round ball shape, it was now conical (much like today's bullets).<ref name=nswshr-1947/>\n\nAs the only complete and functioning example of this gun type in the state, the 12-pounder rifled breech-loading gun at Deniliquin has state heritage significance as the only item that can adequately demonstrate the technical advancements of the rifled breech-loading gun in NSW.<ref name=nswshr-1947/>\n\n'''The place has a strong or special association with a particular community or cultural group in New South Wales for social, cultural or spiritual reasons.'''\n\nThe 12-pounder rifled breech-loading gun at Deniliquin is significant to the artillery community of NSW. It was one of the first significant historical weapons identified by the Royal Australian Artillery Historical Society (now Company) (RAAHC) upon its formation in 1981.<ref name=nswshr-1947/>\n\nRecognised as being a significant piece of historical artillery in NSW, the gun underwent a pioneering restoration effort under the supervision of RAAHC. Upon the completion of its restoration in 1988, the 12-pounder rifled breech-loading gun at Deniliquin was the only item of its type in Australia in such superior condition (others being in disrepair or private ownership). Identified and catalogued by the RAAHC, the 12-pounder rifled breech-loading gun at Deniliquin was the only complete item of its type that was accessible to the artillery community of NSW (today, a restored 12-pounder rifled breech-loading gun is in [[Canberra]] and another in Werribee, Victoria and an incomplete gun can also be found in Karrakatta, [[Western Australia]]).<ref name=nswshr-1947/>\n\nThe significance of the 12-pounder rifled breech-loading gun to the artillery community of NSW and in particular to the RAAHC, with an official membership numbering in the hundreds and an interest group in the thousands, demonstrates the social significance of this item to the state of NSW.<ref name=nswshr-1947/>\n\n'''The place has potential to yield information that will contribute to an understanding of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales.'''\n\nAs the only example of its type in NSW, the 12-pounder rifled breech-loading gun at Deniliquin is of state heritage significance as an intact and functioning example of a gun type that, when designed by British engineer-turned-artillery manufacturer Sir William Armstrong in 1854, was an unparalleled technological advancement for the international artillery industry.<ref name=nswshr-1947/>\n\nFurther examples of this gun (approximately four in addition to that at Deniliquin) are known to exist in Victoria, Western Australia and Canberra but only the Canberra gun (located at the Australian War Memorial) is comparable to that in Deniliquin for its condition and integrity. For the artillery community of NSW, the Deniliquin gun is the only example in the state that can adequately demonstrate and display the unparalleled advancement of its design and where the community can research, learn and understand the exceptional technical values of the rifled breech-loading gun.<ref name=nswshr-1947/>\n\nClose analysis of the gun and its elements will demonstrate how this technologically revolutionary design was constructed and how this type of gun (the first in history to be loaded from the rear rather than through the muzzle) changed artillery use on the international stage.<ref name=nswshr-1947/>\n\n'''The place possesses uncommon, rare or endangered aspects of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales.'''\n\nThe 12-pounder rifled breech-loading gun at Deniliquin is of state heritage significance as the only example of its gun type in NSW. Further examples of this gun (approximately four in addition to that at Deniliquin) are known to exist in Victoria, Western Australia and Canberra (at the Australian War Memorial) but only the Deniliquin and Canberra guns are in complete, intact and functioning condition.<ref name=nswshr-1947/>\n\nFor the people and state of NSW, the 12-pounder rifled breech-loading gun at Deniliquin is particularly rare as the only remaining example of the revolutionary rifled breech-loading gun type which can demonstrate the unparalleled internationally technological achievement of its design to the people of NSW.<ref name=nswshr-1947/>\n\n'''The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a class of cultural or natural places/environments in New South Wales.'''\n\nThe 12-pounder rifled breech-loading gun at Deniliquin is of state heritage significance to NSW as an exceptional representative example of a gun type that, upon its production and introduction into military service, revolutionised artillery technology and design on an international scale.<ref name=nswshr-1947/>\n\nAs the only complete, intact and functioning example of its type in the state, this 12-pounder rifled breech-loading gun has the capacity to adequately demonstrate to the people of NSW the principle characteristics and significant heritage values of an internationally unparalleled class of artillery.<ref name=nswshr-1947/>\n\n== See also ==\n{{stack|{{portal|New South Wales|War}}}}\n* [[Military history of Australia]]\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n=== Bibliography ===\n* {{cite book|last=Kinard|first=Jeff|date=2007|title=Weapons and Warfare: An Illustrated History of its Impact}}\n* {{cite book|author=Grant, Jonathan A.|date=2007|title=Rulers, Guns, and Money: The Global Arms Trade in the Age of Imperialism}}\n* {{cite book|last=Browning|first=Kevin|date=2009|title=NSW State Heritage Inventory Form}}\n* {{cite book|last=Browning|first=Kevin|author2=Evans, Jeff |author3=Hall, Graeme |author4=Hall, Yvonne |author5=Webster, Peter |author6=Alan, Damian|date=2008|title=Artillery Pieces in New South Wales: Thematic Survey}}\n\n=== Attribution ===\n{{NSW-SHR-CC|name=12 Pounder Rifled Breech-Loading Gun (Armstrong) (moveable heritage item)|dno=5061114|id=1947|year=2020|accessdate=18 February 2020}}\n\n[[Category:New South Wales State Heritage Register]]\n[[Category:Deniliquin]]\n[[Category:Military installations in New South Wales]]\n[[Category:Weapons of Australia]]\n[[Category:Articles incorporating text from the New South Wales State Heritage Register]]\n[[Category:Military equipment of Australia]]\n", "name_user": "Arjayay", "label": "safe", "comment": "Duplicate word removed", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deniliquin_12_Pounder_Rifled_Breech-Loading_Gun"}
